<h1>The Land of the Hibiscus Blossom</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Hume Nisbet</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>Preface.</h2>

<p>LAST year, while travelling over Australasia collecting material
for a work then being prepared, I thought to score a point for my
firm while up in Northern Queensland by visiting that as yet
considerably dark island, New Guinea.</p>

<p>The Melbourne editor and agent at once consented to my proposal,
and considered, with me, that it would be of great advantage to the
work if I could make my notes and sketches from the savages and their
land direct, if I thought it was worth risking my life for; but was
it after all worth the risk?</p>

<p>In Australia, New Guinea is a name to inspire fear and trembling;
they are much nearer to the dreaded cannibals, and hear more of their
deeds of atrocity than we in England are and do. Tales of death from
fever to those who luckily escape the spears and poisoned arrows
float down monthly.</p>

<p>"God help you if you go to that fever-stricken land," wrote a
Victorian friend, by way of farewell.</p>

<p>I considered it worth the risk, and as I had in former years lived
with the cannibals of New Zealand, besides having had some distant
relations wolfed amongst them in the good old days, I did not feel
quite the same shrinking as a new chum might.</p>

<p>It was rather amusing to hear the sad forebodings of casual
friends whom I picked up as I progressed towards my destination; the
nearer I drew to it, the sadder became the gloomy farewells.</p>

<p>"You are too plump to escape the natives."</p>

<p>"Just the temperament to catch the fever quickly." And so on.</p>

<p>I made friends at Thursday Island, and was fortunate enough to
find the mail-steamer going, not only to Moresby, but round the coast
as far as Teste Island; so Mr. Vivian Bowden, the plucky manager of
the enterprising firm of Messrs. Burns, Philip, and Co., made up his
mind to take a little holiday and accompany me on the voyage round
the British part of the island.</p>

<p>I am indebted to his kindness in many ways; not less to his great
patience, allowing me to use their vessel pretty much as I liked, but
in giving me time to take as many sketches as I wished, besides
introducing me to the genial and generous traders throughout the
islands of the Torres Straits, and where they had ventured to
establish stations in New Guinea.</p>

<p>I met with no mishaps from natives, nor did I catch the fever.
Everywhere I was cordially received and overpowered with kindness: by
the Governor, his Excellency Sir John Douglas, the missionaries,
white and coloured, the traders, and those splendid man-eaters, the
natives; so that now I can hardly know which to admire or regret the
most, since fate has forced me to say "adieu."</p>

<p>I mixed with the traders and listened to their thrilling tales
night after night; I went amongst the natives, who gave me presents,
looked wonderingly upon my sketches, and treated me like a friend and
brother, acting with scrupulous honesty, and feeling my arms and legs
with apparent pleasure, but without desire.</p>

<p>The Kanaka teachers whom I met astonished me, without exception,
by their patience under no ordinary sufferings and their Christian
heroism; they had come to the land to lay down their lives, and went
with contented faces about their daily sacrifices.</p>

<p>With the missionaries it was the same, Protestant and Catholic; it
was not only a question of giving up the necessities of civilization,
but the yielding up of their lives.</p>

<p>To write a story about New Guinea and introduce fictitious
characters I found to be one of the most distasteful tasks I have
ever attempted, as the number of white men who have as yet been there
are so few that they are all known, with their characteristics, as
well as the names of the islands, with their differences of outline,
which lie about the coast.</p>

<p>Again, when I tried to work out my characters, the men I had known
came up so vividly before me that I found it next to impossible to
resist describing some peculiarity when building up my heroes.</p>

<p>Therefore, if any one is inclined to take umbrage, or fancy
himself to be the person I describe, because in some points he may
trace a resemblance, I trust he will exonerate me entirely as he
reads, and believe me when I tell him that "It is not you I
mean."</p>

<p>There are no such characters in reality as Niggeree, Carolina Joe,
General Flagcroucher, or Professor Killmann--remember that always as
you read; they are entirely imaginary characters, or, rather,
embodied principles of what might influence the future of this great
island, if lawlessness was allowed to run riot and religion and order
were not in the majority.</p>

<p>Yet I will, however, admit that there was a Toto at Hula. He may
be known to those who have been there, particularly to those who may
have been unjustly blamed for his iniquities.</p>

<p>Regarding the geographical correctness of locality, however, the
truth of colouring, and the habits and customs of the people, I have
been most rigid, and never for a moment permitted myself a licence;
also I do not think that I have exaggerated the murders. If the
incidents did not happen while I was there, that they have taken
place, and are taking place weekly, a glance at the Government
records of massacres and atrocities will convince any one; so that,
although I escaped hurtless, it might have been otherwise I will at
once admit.</p>

<p>Besides my own observations, I was indebted while in the Papuan
Gulf for much information from Mr. Andrew Golchi, botanist and
naturalist at Port Moresby, who placed his diaries and experiences of
ten years at my disposal; Mr. Cuthbertson and party of surveyors; Mr.
Bruce and the young missionary, Mr. Savage, at Murray Island; Father
Virgirce at Yule Island; Messrs. Gerise and Moresby, of York Island;
Mr. Kissick, of Teste Island; and Mr. A. Morton, Curator of the
Museum, Hobart, a New Guinea traveller; besides many of the native
teachers and traders with whom I sojourned.</p>

<p>His Excellency Sir John Douglas and his representative, Mr.
Milman, at Thursday Island, also gave me the benefit of their
experiences, and authenticated the sketches and notes which I had
taken.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Lawes I only saw for a few minutes at Port
Moresby, as they had just returned from a coasting cruise; but when I
reached England I had the benefit of many hints and suggestions from
the Rev. James Chalmers, whom I met in London; also a very great
amount of valuable information from my lately-gained friend, the Rev.
Dr. S. Macfarlane, LL.D., whose long experience in the South Seas and
New Guinea fully warrants the trust which I place in his
criticisms.</p>

<p>Details of the discovery of two important rivers since I left the
Papuan coast I received from my friend James Burns--to whom I beg to
dedicate my story--Mr. Theodore Burns being the explorer, for
particulars of which discovery see note on New Rivers.</p>

<p>I admire the missionaries, as I admire the traders, when I can
place myself on their different platforms and look as they do; they
are working faithfully and well in their different ways to civilize
the savages. Yet this is not a missionary tale, but the words of one
who believes as Professor John Ruskin believes, that what the savage
gains from religion and civilization is not equivalent to his own
benefits when left alone.</p>

<p>On the whole, I think we civilized savages murder as much and as
atrociously as the so-called savages do in dark lands, even though we
may not eat our victims; and, aside from this evil, I fancy that they
are happier in their simplicity than we are with our vaunted
civilization.</p>

<p>Still, since we have souls to be redeemed, and if the penalty of
ignorance is damnation, then it is the duty of the missionary to
enlighten the dark races, and ours as Christians, to help them to our
utmost in their noble work.</p>

<p>Looking on the savages of New Guinea from a material standpoint, I
think that they are much more comfortable as they now are than are
our English poor--indeed, than many of our English
middle-classes--who are fighting so madly for an existence, while
they, the natives, bask away luxuriously on their coral-fringed and
sunny strands.</p>

<p>Professor John Ruskin, the philanthropist and friend of mankind in
general, wrote to me on my arrival in England, saying, "I hope you
intend to print some record of the kindness of the native race, whom
I suppose our Christianity will now soon extinguish with gunpowder
and brandy."</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to give a faithful record of the natives and
their kindness, when not abused, towards strangers; and I trust to be
able to tell further, at some future time, of their traits. As yet I
can vouch that I never saw a native of New Guinea touch intoxicants;
they are simple in their diet and drink, and have no more taken to
our firewater than they have taken to our other habits. But how long
it will be before they lose their simplicity, become converts, and
finally are extinguished, is but a question of time.</p>

<p>We who are the favoured ones of earth teach the naked races how to
dress themselves before we bury them. It is the legend of the devil
and Adam being constantly enacted under the specious title,
Civilization.</p>

<p><b>THE AUTHOR.</b></p>

<h3>Chapter I. An Island in the Torres Straits.</h3>

<p>A DARK night, as nights are in the tropics before the moon rises,
in spite of those dense clusters of stars which stain, like
milk-splashes, the intense blue-black of that vault above, or the
more isolated worlds which hang, as if they were electric globes let
down by invisible wires, from that vast ceiling, whose extremity the
eye cannot reach!</p>

<p>Very bright those irregularly hung lamps; very close-set, and
sparkling, those clusters of gems beyond, very filmy the milk-stains
upon that blue--black roof; but the space is too mighty to be
illuminated even by those myriad lights, their effulgence is sucked
up by the miles of atmosphere, and so on the shores, and in the
jungle, darkness grapples with form and wins the battle; the eye
looking up becomes dazed with that studded diamond vault and blinded
to all beneath.</p>

<p>It is an island within that great barrier reef, which extends from
above Keppel Bay to Cape York, and along the Torres Straits to the
Papuan Gulf, making eternal summer and calm seas--one of those
islands raised by the insect creators of continents, who are for ever
working, regardless of time; one of the many formed, or in process of
formation, which greet the anxious glance of the mariner every few
miles of his dangerous navigation through those uncertain waters upon
which the sun warmly smiles, and shows in the varied shades of
delicious green, the spots to be avoided; and, in the threads of
amethyst, the narrow passages to trust for safety. There are no
charts to guide the mariner as yet, only the sharp eyes and the
steady head; for woe to the unlucky master who pins his faith to a
chart, when his vessel sails within these reefs.</p>

<p>This island has been long established as a place of call for
vessels going pearl-fishing, b&ecirc;che-de-mer, or copra collecting,
and is inhabited by a tribe of blacks who give hospitality and work
to the traders who have settled amongst them, and who feed them and
teach them the refinements of civilization, in return for hospitality
and assistance in their business.</p>

<p>The island is well protected from rough seas by the great coral
wall which lies about two miles to westward, and is guarded from the
near approach of uninvited visitors by hummocks and sharp-edged
fringes which are covered at low-tide and surround the smooth
sand-shore, layer within layer, with fathomless depths of ocean
between, until the innermost fringe is passed. Then a long spread of
shallow water has to be waded over, before dry land is reached, so
that the trader, as he sits in his bungalow with his friendly
servant-hosts behind him, need only wait and finish his pipe, if the
visitor chances to be one of those interfering personages, until the
unwary vessel safely runs and sticks against the protecting
reef-walls, when he sallies forth to rescue the wrecked crew and
claim the wreckage according to the very just and proper law of
flotsam.</p>

<p>On this dark night there were several small stranger vessels lying
about alongside Carolina Joe's own craft. (Carolina Joe was the title
this protector of these friendly natives bore amongst his friends and
admirers.) As these vessels were all safely at anchor-age, we must
conclude that they had been here before, and did not come for hostile
purpose.</p>

<p>Neat little craft, rocking under the starlight, and breaking the
reflection of the sparkles below with their hulls and hull-shadows,
but with nothing definite as regards outline or proportion.</p>

<p>On shore--along the dark strips of sand discernible only because
of the more intense shadow of the palm and croton groves behind and
the jet-like reflecting blackness of the water lapping softly against
dead shells and broken fragments of coral--a heavy breath breaking
upon the silence along with a faint cocoa-nut odour, apprises one of
a native gliding past. The sand is smooth, and hard, and pleasant to
the bare feet where it is not covered with those spider-spiked
shells; and from the shallow parts you step upon a smooth warm plain,
for the night is still too young for the heavy dews to cool the
ground; thence into the copse, guided by the faint red glow from the
drying-house. This gleam comes through the crevices of the corrugated
iron sides of the shed, or further on from the hut, where the king
and his family wait awake for the orders of their friend and master,
the trader, and where they silently squat and smoke. The red fire
from their pipes, and the sombre glow from their neglected log alone
break upon the blackness of the night.</p>

<p>It is all quiet and indefinite until a splash of oars, from the
rocking boats, breaks in upon the repose, a gentle splashing of
paddles used by dextrous hands, and the huts are deserted, while the
lonely shore is peopled as if by magic.</p>

<p>They are landing something from the boats, and, without a word
spoken, the object is taken out, lifted by two indistinct forms, and
carried forward, while the canoe drifts back again as the crowd
disappear into the general dark envelopment of night, and once more
all is still.</p>

<h3>Chapter II. Captain Cook's Telescope.</h3>

<p>"THIS yer telescope, mates, belonged to Capting Cook."</p>

<p>"Coudn't ha' believed it?"</p>

<p>"No, there's not a many as can."</p>

<p>Carolina Joe, as host, was exhibiting the curiosities of his
bungalow to the brother traders, who were now sharing his hospitality
for the night, some on their way to New Guinea, some to the islands
and stations scattered over Torres Straits, devoted to pearl-fishing,
copra or b&ecirc;che-de--mer collecting, bird or curio hunting,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The etceteras of their profession included various modes of making
money, which may appear in the course of their conversations, and so
need not be here explained.</p>

<p>Joe held in his brown paws a large copper and canvas-bound
telescope, much battered, though hardly of ancient enough pattern to
have done service in the Endeavour; yet, as these honest old sailors,
who formerly scoured the seas and now bask their declining days under
the cocoanuts, are proverbial for their rigid adherence to facts, it
might have been Cook's.</p>

<p>"This is how it happened, mates: ye all remember the Polly going
on the reefs half a mile from here?"</p>

<p>"That night you lighted the fires at the wrong place, you old
beach--coomber," observed, in a very gruff voice, a swarthy young
man, from a corner where he sat panikin in hand, almost doubled up
from the remains of the malaria fever.</p>

<p>"That was the night, Nig! only you're all out about the fires, I
knowst nothink what-some-ever about these yer fires; the natives had
a wake on that night, and I was sound asleep until they called me up
next morning, and no one can say that I didn't do my duty as a man; I
saved the crew, as ye all know, and lent them my boat Daisy to carry
them to Thursday Island."</p>

<p>"That's true, Joe, the same smack that you afterwards sold the
French missionary with, and which they have christened Pope Pius; and
you say you are a good catholic."</p>

<p>"I am a darned freethinker, as all the world knows; I've got all
the books on it in that yer chest along o' my revolver and 'munition,
and I only did my duty by that yer Daisy. Didn't these missionary
chaps want to get to Yule Island after they were refused permits to
land on New Guinea, and didn't they see the cursed smack afore they
bought her? that was fair and square dealing, wasn't it? Did they
ever ax me one question as to her age, or state of repair? and didn't
they offer me right away 80l. for her, and no questions axed, and was
I going to be a darned old fool and tell them she was rotten? Not
likely, boys; Carolina Joe wasn't raised in old Virginia to come it
that way; besides, didn't I get the boys to paint it all neat over
inside and out without being axed in the bargain?"</p>

<p>Joe paused a moment, flourishing Captain Cook's relic in his right
hand and his empty panikin in the other, and glaring savagely in the
direction of the doubled-up "Nig," who only smiled quietly, without
replying.</p>

<p>"That's all correct, Joe; you did, even before they saw her, as
soon as you heard they wanted a boat," cried out a very slender,
gentlemanly young fellow dressed in spotless white, with an
aristocratic and clean-cut face, who had twice filled his can from
the bottle while Joe was speaking--"but go on about the
telescope."</p>

<p>Joe swaggered over to the deal plank which did service for a
table, emptied about half a bottle of whisky into his panikin, drank
it straight away without winking, and, drawing the hairy back of his
hand across his grizzly beard, went over through the soft sand to his
former place beside his sea-chest, and continued:--</p>

<p>"Wall, along o' the other articles in that er wreck (and precious
little there war, for all the trouble as I took over it)."</p>

<p>"What trouble, Joe?" asked the young man, filling up for the
fourth time, and emptying the bottle as he inquired.</p>

<p>"Landing it on the safest reef in course; didn't I watch her all
that cursed arternoon a-coming on afore the wind with the infernal
moon--soon blowing in my teeth, and not a drop o' liquer to keep the
ague back."</p>

<p>"Oh you did, did you?"</p>

<p>"Of course a man's got to keep his eyes about him, or them niggers
allays bungle business, an' not a wink o' sleep that night I got,
thinking they'd get off after all."</p>

<p>"But I thought you were fast asleep that night," observed Nig
softly.</p>

<p>"Asleep, who do you think could plant the fires right if I fell
asleep?"</p>

<p>A general grin passed round the company, as one little
girlish-looking man, with bright blue eyes and fair moustache, drew
with his knife corkscrew the corks from three more bottles of whisky,
while the others held out their panikins for him to fill up, and then
they settled down to listen, and light their pipes.</p>

<p>"Cartainly Queen Ine is purty smart, and can do most anything I
teach her to do, but it's best to superintend delicate work
oneself."</p>

<p>"Quite right, Joe! Quite right," responded, in a thin voice,
Captain Allan Collins, with his head on one side; he wore it thus,
not from choice or habit, but from necessity, having had it nearly
severed at one time by natives, the same cause which produced his
piping voice.</p>

<p>"But about that telescope, Joe; how do you know it to have been
Cook's?" asked the youth with the clean-cut features.</p>

<p>"Because after we got that wreck broken up, I found it amongst the
coral under her hull, and because his name war written on it; of
course, mates, it warn't very plain, yet I could just make it out,
though the friction had wore off the date. I could just make out the
letters, 'COOK,' a way he had o' spellin' his name, I believe."</p>

<p>"Not an uncommon way of spelling cook. Might it not have belonged
to some ship's cook--?"</p>

<p>This from the youth with an air of innocence, upon which the
others laughed.</p>

<p>"Ship's cook! When did ye ever hear of a cook with a telescope
like this?"</p>

<p>"It certainly would be superfluous furniture to cart about, but
let's see it; is the name still on it?"</p>

<p>"Wall, you see, Queen Ine is fond o' polishing up brass work, and
I guess that's how it wore off, but it was there when we fust had it,
wasn't it, 'Spears'?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! right under where the canvas now is, we covered it so to
preserve it," responded Spears, from his chin.</p>

<p>"After it was gone," murmured Nig sadly, puffing out a little
smoke from his nearly finished pipe.</p>

<h3>Chapter III. In the Bungalow.</h3>

<p>CAROLINA JOE'S abode, where this little convivial gathering of
friends were now seated, was built after the style of the native
houses upon the islands; a hut with posts and rafters of bamboo,
lathed with split cane, walls and roof thatched with fronds of the
bamboo and tattered fringes of the banana, a sloping roof with the
ragged ends of the thatch hanging down between the bars of split
cane, walls hung at odd places with tortoiseshells strung together
and ready for transport, native curios, spears, shields, and
ornaments, all there for sale purposes, yet giving the interior a
most picturesque appearance. A rough form had been made by "Spears,"
formerly a ship's carpenter, but who now represented the handy man of
the island, a table likewise made from a roughly sawn board, and
which, with three sea-chests, comprised the furniture of the
bungalow--that is with the exception of the bamboo couches; with
these the place was plentifully supplied, three sides of the room
being taken up with them; broad springy couches, each capable of
accommodating six or eight people, and where Joe was wont to loll and
smoke during the days when there was no drink in the locker, for on
these balmy islands whisky does not come every day in the week, nor
even once in the month. Sometimes months passed before the ordered
case arrived, and when it did turn up, one day was sufficient to
empty it, the rest of the long interval having to be spun out with
cocoa-nut milk. To-night Joe was merry, for three long-delayed cases
had arrived all at once, so that the result meant a glorious orgie
while they lasted.</p>

<p>The bungalow had been raised on the sands which served for floor
and carpet, soft fine dry sand into which the feet sank deeply; like
all native houses the door-way served to admit fresh air and light,
so that while by day the sun glared outside, and beat upon the sea
shores until they felt nearly red hot, or slanted in long white rays
between the fronds of palms, here there was always a cool and
constant twilight.</p>

<p>A pleasant home to rest in, amid tropic heats, in spite of the
multitudinous life which swarmed and throve amidst that tawny
coloured thatch; scorpions, centipedes, spiders and snakes--one gets
used to all that as one gets used to mosquitoes, and soon forgets the
dangers and discomforts; but upon the stranger, the flop-flap of the
poisonous snake moving about at nights after mice and vermin inside
the sleeping quarters, has a disturbing effect. The thud of the large
centipede, as it drops from the roof upon your face or shoulders is
apt to cause a shudder, while the sight of a huge hairy-limbed
tarantula lazily moving towards you, not many feet off, does not
conduce to speedy repose, any more than the buzzing and stinging of
the myriad mosquitoes will do; yet to all these discomforts time
brings the cure, and after all it is astonishing how little trouble
there is about even misery when one gets used to it.</p>

<p>A pair of tight boots, or the parting with a dear friend, shape in
alike by degrees.</p>

<p>This night the mosquitoes swarmed in myriads; spotted fiends bred
in the mangroves and making night musical with their revengeful
ditties; in the soft sands one being pricked in the foot never felt
sure whether it was the bite of a centipede or the sharp edge of a
shell; from the slender rafters heavy webs swung undisturbed, the
whole only faintly lighted by the single tallow-candle which flared
in the night breeze and overflowed the square sides of the empty
gin-bottle which served as a candlestick. But those assembled were
long accustomed to sights like this; indeed this represented Elysium
after the close cabins of their little vessels, and they spread out
their scantily clad limbs with an air of unaccustomed comfort.</p>

<p>A ruddy illumination of bronzed faces, bare arms and legs, and
exposed chests, as they sat there gradually getting mellow and
disconnected in their articulation, while fresh corks were drawn, and
young cocoanuts emptied of their fluid.</p>

<p>These young cocoanuts are only used for the milk, which serves
instead of water to quench thirst or dilute spirits, although on
nights like this, and in such company, like the water used in the
punch-brew of the "Noctes" club, one cocoanut went much further than
a bottle of "Tappit Hen."</p>

<p>The apartment was about eighteen feet by twelve, so that the
company sat close and the single candle served to make objects
discernible while at the same time flinging heavy shadows behind and
above.</p>

<p>Spears and Danby (the youth with the aristocratic features) half
reclined upon one of the couches in the shady side of the room,
dangling their naked limbs, with their pijamas rolled up to the
thighs for the sake of wading freely, and dipping their feet into the
soft loose sand which they caught up between their toes and scattered
about while they drank and smoked.</p>

<p>By the plank-table, and crouched together leaning his bare brown
arms against it, sat "Nig," or Niggeree, as the natives called him;
sallow, thin, and looking undersized and weary, from the after
prostration of the fever he had gone through, that wasting fever
caught at Port Moresby: to-night he appeared to be about twenty-six;
a weak young man, speaking in a low dejected tone, and with great
effort; he was clean shaven, with regular features and eyes black and
filmy; he only spoke when addressed or when chaffing Joe, and then
said as little as he could as if finding the attempt too much for his
strength; his pipe had gone out and he did not attempt to light it
afresh, and when he lifted his can to his lips he merely tasted the
contents, and put it down again with a contortion as if it was
medicine.</p>

<p>Near him, on one of the sea-chests, sat Captain Allan Collins,
with his head on one side, displaying a long thin neck, and sharing
the seat with the German engineer, Hans Helfich; while on the ground
amongst and half buried in the sand squatted the short and burly
figure of that old sea--dog, Captain MacAndrews, master of the little
reef-steamer Thunder, which now lay to leeward of the island.</p>

<p>The group here gathered together, and unconsciously striking up
picturesque attitudes within this native-built hut, might well have
been taken for a pirate crew holding their nightly orgies ashore
under the wind-shaken flame of this candle--perhaps in drawing the
picture it would be better to substitute a flaring torch for the
flickering candle, only that this was a hut built of easily-ignited
material instead of being a sea--rover's cave, while the gentlemen
assembled were only honest traders and idlers out for an adventure
instead of being bold buccaneers, so perhaps it is as well in this
case to adhere to strict facts, prosy though they be.</p>

<p>Niggeree being nearest the candle, caught upon his swarthy, if
wan, neck and chest, the strongest glare, and as he had turned to
speak to Hector, the young man with the fresh girlish face, his
profile was completely in shadow, as were his lower limbs and left
shoulder, a trifle brown where the skin shone out, with an edge of
dingy yellow undershirt torn open at the neck for air.</p>

<p>Hector stood still drawing corks, but tasting only from the
half--cocoanut, which he had made a cup of, for while he diligently
filled out for the others, as strong as they desired, he took his
cocoa-milk unadulterated, as Joe took his spirits.</p>

<p>The light shone full upon Hector, and revealed a fair young face,
which the sun had only slightly reddened, and a breast white as a
child's flesh below the abrupt line made by the shirt when buttoned;
a golden moustache, and limpid blue eyes, where truth might have
dwelt serene; his voice soft and caressing, his manner deprecating,
as if he felt an intruder, and his age seemingly about twenty-one. As
he replied to "Nig's" dejected question with a few earnest words, as
if his soul spoke through his lips, a stranger might wonder at so
much innocence wandering so far from home; but none of the company
seemed surprised. In reality he was twenty-nine, and if the shirt had
been thrown a little wider, discoloured blue blotches would have
revealed where the spear or bullet had pierced; also the table cast
too heavy a shadow over the bare lower limbs to reveal the many scars
there. Hector, with the girl's face and small body, had fought his
way into respect with these rough traders of the Torres Straits,
while the man-eating savages of the Fly River paid as much attention
to his tender words as to a pistol-shot.</p>

<p>Joe, as master of the premises, was monopolizing the conversation,
and no small portion of the grog. As a rule, he was said to be equal
to a case of whisky or brandy by himself at one square sitting, and
wild stories were afloat as to how long he had continued to consume
this daily case before he began to see snakes about. When three parts
of the case, i.e. six bottles, had been safely stowed away, they said
he was getting good company. But, as has been stated, he had had a
long spell of enforced abstinence, and now, although only the
contents of a case and a half had gone the round, he was already
getting disconnected in his reminiscences.</p>

<p>"I was reared in Virginia, boys, and all our family were Federals.
Would you like to hear how I lost my mother?--"</p>

<p>Captain Allan Collins was remarking to Hans Helfich and the burly
MacAndrews, whose clustering grey curls surrounded the upper portion
of a head and beard which might have served as the model for Achilles
as it gleamed out in half-tones against the intensity of the shadow
behind, that although admiring Niggeree's principles in general, he
considered him a little too quick with his Winchester and cutlas,
while the Irish mate of the Thunder was engaged amidst the tobacco
fog singing an Irish legend entitled "Brian on the Moor;" so that no
one replied, or expressed the slightest curiosity about the maternal
affliction which had befallen their host.</p>

<p>"My mother, boys, was the natural but unacknowledged wife of the
late General Jackson; so that I, being her only child, oughter ha'
been his heir--"</p>

<p>"I don't approve of shooting the moment a native pokes his head
down the gangway," said Captain Collins; "Nig does. Give them time to
declare themselves, and after that, fire or don't fire, as the case
may be."</p>

<p>The mosquitoes were being driven out by degrees as the atmosphere
became loaded with tobacco-smoke; still the Irish legend was chaunted
behind the veil, while no one paid any attention except to his own
voice.</p>

<p>"Wall, it was just afore the war that the Injuns came down and
scalped the whole twelve on 'em, leaving me, in a manner, an
orphan."</p>

<p>"What twelve?" asked Danby, the aristocratic-featured youth,
simply.</p>

<p>"What twelve did you think, ye blasted fool? not the twelve
apostles, surely?"</p>

<p>"Well, how could I know unless you tell me?"</p>

<p>"My poor brothers and sisters, of course, along with their dam,
fought, Jeruselam! but they did sell their blessed lives dear, yet it
warnt no use."</p>

<p>"But I thought you were the only child and heir of General
Jackson?"</p>

<p>Joe stood for a moment dazed, as if he had lost something, while
he passed his hand over his brow and threw back his grizzly hair,
then with a drunken laugh he picked it up,--</p>

<p>"Don't you know Amerikay's the place for divorces cheap? and could
my mother not marry again if she liked, and have twenty children if
she blarned well liked to? What's to prevent her, I want to
know--?"</p>

<p>"I don't often shoot," said Captain Collins, "but when I shoot, I
kill; and, take my word on it, that's about the only way to get
respect from the natives of New Guinea."</p>

<h3>Chapter IV. Queen Ine.</h3>

<p>"KILLMANN! Who says he didn't shoot? Ax the natives? I tell ye
what, when he was up that 'ere coast, if he saw a man walking along
the sands with a fine mop on him and some beads which he thought
would look well amongst his curios, he thought no more of putting up
his rifle and potting that native, than he did o' bringing down a
bird of but then I always did say that he was like Nig there, just a
little too reachy."</p>

<p>Captain Allan Collins was having the best of it, for he had got an
audience while Joe had dropped upon the sands nearly helpless, with
hardly voice enough left even to blaspheme.</p>

<p>"Ten o'clock, boys, and Carolina Joe as drunk as Tam o' Shanter;
time we were all aboard if we mean to be up to time to-morrow
morning," said a voice from the fog as it parted and revealed a
figure about five foot eight, slim built and gentlemanly, with an
olive tinted face and close--clipped black beard.</p>

<p>"All right, Bowman, I'm ready," responded Danby, getting up as
calmly as if no whisky had crossed his clean-cut lips, although the
boy had been supplied twice every round.</p>

<p>At the same moment the burly sea model of Achilles struggled to
his feet, as did the others.</p>

<p>"Get up, Orphan Jackson," said Danby, giving the prostrate Joe a
heavy slap with his bare foot, "here comes your father-in-law, with
two of your royal brothers, and you haven't shown us Queen Ine and
the last batch of pie-bald twins yet."</p>

<p>Carolina Joe, who had not lain above five minutes, rose as if he
had been sleeping twelve hours, and apparently shook the drink-stupor
as easily from him as a man might shake the night mists away in the
early morning, while at the same moment an old native appeared in the
doorway attired in a soldier's faded red coat minus the buttons, a
tall white hat, and by way of under garb, a blue rag tied round his
waist; he was white-bearded, grey-skinned, and bleary-eyed, and as he
stood in the dim light of the guttering candle looked like a mummy
dressed for a masquerade, while close behind him appeared two
stalwart young blacks, bearing between them the third case of
drink.</p>

<p>"What's in that case, Bowman?" inquired Joe, in a surly tone.</p>

<p>"Gin, Joe!" answered Bowman. "It's all we have now left
aboard."</p>

<p>"It'll do," growled Joe. "Break the thing up and let us taste
it."</p>

<p>Little Hector, ever ready with his sharp knife, stooped to prise
open the case, while Joe continued, turning to the ancient
king,--</p>

<p>"Where's the women, Primrose?"</p>

<p>"All gone sleep, Joe."</p>

<p>"An' Queen Ine?"</p>

<p>"Waiting down by beach."</p>

<p>"Fetch her, I've promised to show her to my mates, d'ye hear! an'
don't forget the kids."</p>

<p>"She say you too dam drunk, and she no come to-night," said the
king solemnly.</p>

<p>"You go down and tell her I want her, an' no humbug."</p>

<p>"All right!" replied his majesty, stalking out with an offended
air as if at not being honoured enough.</p>

<p>"Here!" bawled out Joe, who seemed to know what the matter
was.</p>

<p>The king returned, and stood solemnly waiting with his two sons
behind him.</p>

<p>"Boys, this yer is my father-in-law, and the king of this island,
and these yer are two of the princes, so if ye've got a stick o'
baccy to give him, give it without more ado, and let him fetch his
daughter."</p>

<p>Bowman and Danby pulled out some sticks of trader's tobacco, and
bestowed them upon his majesty, who in return gave them his paw to
shake, and then went out to fetch in the rebellious spouse of their
host.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the case of gin was opened, one of the bottles produced,
and uncorked, while Joe, now once more sober and genial, drank a
parting peg along with his friends; he took a full measure to
himself, but was economical as regards the measure of his
friends.</p>

<p>"You've had nigh enough o' my grog, mates, this bout; I'll keep
the rest for a nightcap arter you're aboard, for the Lord only knows
when the next lot will come to hand."</p>

<p>Joe had reached that rebounding stage, which often succeeds the
generosity of the drunkard.</p>

<p>"I suppose you want to have a good old spree with your
father-in-law to-night, Joe," said Bowman, laughing over the meanness
of the trader.</p>

<p>"No fears, I don't encourage drinkin' on this yer island, I give
them tobacco, but not a drop o' grog, that's too precious."</p>

<p>Queen Ine appeared at this moment with her month-old twins,
sullen, and being pushed forward by her father.</p>

<p>"My wife, mates, and the two last kids."</p>

<p>"Hallo! Joe, they are the same as last lot, one half caste and one
pure black," cried Danby, looking over them, while the mother stood
with sullen brows, and casting ominous glances towards her lord and
master.</p>

<p>"That's the curious part on it, boys, Queen Ine always fetches
twins, and always that way, one black and one white."</p>

<p>Queen Ine was a magnificent specimen of womanhood, tall, black as
coal, upright, and, where exposed, with flesh as firm as marble; she
was attired in the loose blue single shirt-gown which the
missionaries give to the native women as a token of civilization. It
was fastened at the shoulders and open in the neck, the rest falling
in the graceful clinging folds with which sculptors drape their
goddesses; she now stood half--shrouded in that rank mist through
which the expiring candle shot up irregular flashes, that barely
reached her, with that sullen look upon her heavily-bent brows and
that lurid gleam in her dark eyes, while beside her, like a showman
at a fair exhibiting the points of a leopard, hung the
half-intoxicated ruler of her life, with his dirty, torn, red shirt
open to the waist, his ragged patched trousers, and his bestial
expression as he laid his heavy brown hairy arm across that
satin-lustred jet-black shrinking shoulder; for he had half torn her
gown from her as she stood passively but sternly under his coarse
caresses. The two tokens of her own degradation were lying against
her breasts, and were held carelessly up with one strong,
lovely-modelled arm. She appeared to represent an ebony statue of
indignant Nature, protesting mutely against that bestiality of
so-called civilization, which degrades where it cannot slay.</p>

<p>Her father, like an ape, and her two brothers ranged beside her
emotionless, seemed to be sunk to the level of her white husband, but
she stood like a ruined queen.</p>

<p>"That's the sort of woman for a sailor, boys; I can leave her to
look after this island when I'm away, and not one dare disobey; look
on these arms, why, she could fell an ox with her club."</p>

<p>Queen Ine stood passive and scowling as he lifted her disengaged
bare arm to show it to his friends, and as he let it go it dropped
limply by her side, while his drunken friends pinched the firm flesh,
and praised her up according to their lights. The candle leapt up
wildly, before it sent its flame to air, and showed the whole scene
with an intense flame, which did not even screen the bloated
tarantula on the rafters: then, as they turned with one impulse to
stagger out to the stars and freshness of the night, the degradation
of the picture was mercifully blotted out, and Joe was left in
darkness, with his case of gin and the woman who called him
master.</p>

<h3>Chapter V. B&ecirc;che-De-Mer Working.</h3>

<p>IT is impossible to lie in bed after the sun rises in the tropics
(no matter how late one goes to sleep), but pleasure ineffable to get
up as the light appears and before the stars are quite quenched by
the approaching flood of light.</p>

<p>Next morning the scene on the beach was a busy one, natives
thronging in their canoes, laden with water-casks and fruit for the
vessels about to sail, little boys and girls tumbling about the
waves, or trying to fish with their pronged fish-spears, women with
their infants sitting on the sands, and a constant passing to and fro
of dark semi-nude figures, or sunburnt seamen.</p>

<p>Behind the slueing cluster of smacks lay the more massive, if less
picturesque, outline of the little steamer Thunder, with her black
sides and heavy Dutch-built stern, and her painted funnels emitting
their gaseous vapours, which became discoloured as they were wafted
towards that opal space overhead, and spread in filmy melting clouds
upon the otherwise cloudless sky.</p>

<p>The natives had been awake and working even while the stars were
still lustrous, under the direction of King Primrose, and his
stern-browed daughter, Queen Ine; but the master lay grunting and
tossing on his bamboo couch in that uneasy after-slumber which ever
precedes the awakening from the dreamless lethargy of the
drunkard.</p>

<p>Joe was right about the mother of his children; whether she loved
or hated him was a matter of little consequence, so that she kept the
islanders in good order. This she did with a devotion and energy
which might well be the zealous outcome of love; the natives obeyed
her orders with alacrity and without a murmur; even her father, as he
took up his position of august dignity on the sands, was fain to skip
nimbly out of her way, as with club in hand, and gown tucked up, she
swiftly passed from group to group of the workers.</p>

<p>A constant chattering went on as they laboured, but Queen Ine only
muttered a word now and again, or lifted her club threateningly over
some skulker, yet none appeared to wait upon its descent, for when
she drew near they bent down instantly, with the obsequity of slaves
to pick up the bag or cask they had been inclined to pass before, and
energetically rushed to the spring or boat waiting to receive it.</p>

<p>Her six children were on the sands under the charge of an old
black woman, and at times when they came near her, or clung to her
skirts, she caught them impatiently by the arm, and flung them from
her as if they were puppies or kittens, and when she did so they ran
back to the old nurse, but never cried, as English children would
have done, over their rebuff and fall.</p>

<p>Six children, all naked, and of assorted sizes, four boys and two
girls; three of the boys were of a rich deep brown, while the other
boy and the two girls were copper tinted, a shade or two lighter than
the sun-tanned skin of their father.</p>

<p>Pretty children, who rolled over one another in the bright cool
dawn, half-buried at times in the grey sand, like young leopard
pups--three pairs of twins, with the month old ones lying alone
mutely on their backs, and seeming to look at the wonderful
pearly-toned immensity above; the aged nurse with close grizzled hair
sat heedless of all around, preparing some yams which she held upon a
flat canoe-shaped wooden basin and put, when peeled, into an
earthenware pot.</p>

<p>Not far from the aged one, a fire was burning on the beach, and
one or two girls sitting round it, also cutting up yams, taro, and
hard bananas, with their platters and pots beside them. On one side a
woman crouched with her hands over her face and her head bent,
rocking backwards and forwards and moaning piteously, at which no one
appeared to pay any attention, although the eyes of the others looked
bleary as if with weeping.</p>

<p>There had been a death in the village the day before, and the
others had done their lamenting; this one, however, having been at
the other side of the island, had only just arrived to hear the sad
news, and now alone sat weeping.</p>

<p>It was the custom for every one to do a stated amount of
lamenting, so she was only performing her duty, while the others went
on calmly with their daily work and chattered amongst themselves as
the glorious light grew more intense and rosy behind the dark thicket
of crotons, and inside some shady hut in the village over within that
dark thicket, some heart lay moaning, yet not according to
custom.</p>

<p>The b&ecirc;che-de-mer prepared weeks before against the coming of
this little trading-steamer Thunder, had been mostly transferred on
board, with the water casks filled from the spring and emptied into
the ship's iron tanks, before the sun lifted its dazzling disc above
the crotons; it was all subdued and silvery, a coral island done in
soft grey tones, with the exception of the rose-madder gleam eastward
over by the rocks, crotons, and palm-tops, and the different dingies
had landed their human freights of blacks and whites, who now mingled
together on the sands as the canoes and dingies hobnobbed on the
waters.</p>

<p>Five minutes more the sun would be in possession, and that
comparative hush banished for the day. Joe came down from his
bungalow, unwashed and dry-mouthed, cursing the light and d----g all
the eyes which that light was bathing, and the world in general as he
staggered towards his guests of the night previous, attired as he lay
down in his ragged bepatched pants and buttonless dingy red flannel
shirt, while Queen Ine stood waiting silently with her subjects for
his further orders, and, as she waited, suckling one of the twins
which she had snatched up from the ground at the sight of her
husband; it was the black baby she had taken up, the other lay still
looking up at the sky, his mouth stuffed with one end of a cowrie
shell.</p>

<p>"----my eyes," observed Joe in husky tones as he came up, "have ye
got all the cargo aboard?"</p>

<p>"All aboard, Joe, but what about that other lot you said you had?"
answered and inquired Bowman, who stood attired in a gay suit of
pijamas rolled up to the thighs and armpits, while young Danby, with
his pale, thin, aristocratic face, calmly sucked at his briar-wood
pipe, attired in a waistband of Turkey red alone, his slender limbs
and body gleaming whitely amongst the sunburnt and black
surroundings.</p>

<p>"You'll have to come for it over to the other island; it ain't
much out of your way, and I'll go with you arter we've got summut to
drink and eat. What have ye got aboard?"</p>

<p>"Fresh mutton, a keg of brandy, and a good king-fish caught this
morning," replied Bowman.</p>

<p>"That'll do, it's a long time since I tasted anything fresh,"
grunted Joe; "but have ye no whisky?"</p>

<p>"Not a drop; but you can bring one of your own bottles; we left
you half a case last night, besides the gin."</p>

<p>"I'm keeping that as a medicine against accidents; Queen Ine might
be bad, or the kids, so we'll just do with your brandy."</p>

<p>"As you will," responded Bowman, who knew his man. "Fetch your own
dingey and go aboard; I want to see what Collins and Hector have got
before we start, so go aboard and we'll follow you."</p>

<p>"All right," said Joe. Then turning to where his wife stood with
her black baby, he said, "Look ye here, Queen Ine, I'm going away for
a couple of days, so you'll see to the island while I'm away."</p>

<p>Queen Ine nodded silently.</p>

<p>"An' don't have any humbug or laziness. The cargo in the
smoke-house will be ready when the sun goes down. Get that other lot
over yere" (he pointed to a black mound lying a little distance from
them on the sands, at which she again nodded) "put in to-night, it'll
be about ready by the time I get back."</p>

<p>Joe did not waste time kissing, as he turned his back on his
spouse and prepared to step into the dingey, which he shoved off.</p>

<p>"An' look ye here, wench," he shouted, resting on his oars with
one foot on the gunwale, "send Sam over to the island with Fairy to
bring me home again; he'd better start at once as the wind is
fair."</p>

<p>Queen Ine once more acknowledged with a bend of her sombre head
that she understood, and walked straightway towards the croton
thicket, as Joe, now having shoved his boat into deep water, sat
down, with both oars dipping into the blue-grey waters and his back
against the steamer towards which he was bound; while Bowman and
Danby turned into their own boat, which their Malay boys were now
pushing along by the shallow sands.</p>

<p>A second more and the sea will be gleaming quick-silver; the
palm--fronds still heavy with the dews, which lie like hoar-frost
upon the broad, umbrella-like leaves of the undergrowth and grasses,
hang limply down underneath the refreshing weight; the spiders' webs
which swing, hammock-fashion, from branch to branch, are like
filagree work in dull white metal. All the shadows are purple with
the vapours of the earth that steal upwards and blanch the local
tints of green, the flowers scarlet and blue upon the shrubs and
creepers, are drooping like half-closed lids. There is an air of
slumber over all; on the cool grey sands, where the tinted and spiked
shells are lying unheeded, are lovely shapes and prismatic splashes
of pure and broken colours, like the fresh setting of a palette in a
shady studio; the sea, without glitter enough to make a shadow, lies
a subtle gradation of blue-grey to bleached fawn, the rocks and
exposed brown edges of the reefs are inane grey, with hardly a break;
the natives round their fires, some distance off, seem to pose silent
and motionless, as natives do, waiting for that intense second to
elapse, and then the Lord of Day has risen.</p>

<p>First a gleam of scarlet upon the bare upper branches of the
bone-like croton-trees, and a dash of glittering bronze running down
the core and quivering ribbons of the top palm branches as they seem
to shake off their sleep and stretch upwards, like arms thrown out
while wakers yawn; then over the thicket, towards which Queen Ine
slowly paces, the golden rim appears, burning the outer edges and
seeming to shrivel them downwards, as he flings mellow fire upon the
edges of ringed trunks and dew-drenched leaves.</p>

<p>Now the paroquettes and cockatoos begin to wake up and flutter in
that light-bath, and the sands blush till they glow like the petals
of delicate roses. Then, with the gaiety of the gathering sunbeams,
Rest seems to fly and all becomes laughter and motion; the ocean is
swarming with ripples and golden threads, and the boulders and shells
become filled with detail.</p>

<p>Joe, a dark spot upon the even sea, seems to be sucked into that
universal lustre, and is soon absorbed from sight. The Thunder still
holds her own, as a shadow, but her propeller, idly thrashing the
water, appears as if it were turning up silver, and the smacks, as
they dance about, to become nautilus shells; deep purple streaks
border those rosy flushes, growing to gold, and the head of the
mourner beside the yam-peelers is lifted up to greet the penetrating
ray, for she has finished her task of lamentation and now laughs,
with the tears still hanging like diamonds to her dark cheeks.</p>

<p>Queen Ine pauses in her walk as she reaches the inky mound of half
dry b&ecirc;che-de-mer, and fumbles amongst it for a moment with the
hand that does not hold the baby, turning over the under layer of
damp slugs so that the sun may also finish his work, and as she
stoops, a sun-shaft strikes within her eyelids and turns the dark
eyes to a blood-red glare; then she raises up her square, strong
shoulders and looks at it for a moment while it beats softly against
her heaving breasts, and with a full breath of satisfaction, her
stern features somewhat relax, while she clutches the child a little
tighter, and passes on.</p>

<p>Half way to the thicket a figure stands in the shallow water
gazing fixedly upon the distant sea; Queen Ine, as she sees him,
deviates from her course and walks towards him, but he pays no
attention to the splashes that she sends up on either side of her as
she impatiently beats the water down with her hasty feet; he stands
motionless with his face sea-ward and his back upon her.</p>

<p>A weird figure, clad only in a tattered and faded blue cotton
shirt, with the arms torn from it and the extremities fluttering like
banana leaves when wind-tossed and tattered.</p>

<p>"Hafid," she says sternly, laying her hand upon his shoulder, and
then he turns round and faces her, and the two look at one another
without speaking.</p>

<p>His hair is falling loosely and wildly about his neck, straight
black hair, streaked with white, and all in a tangle, that makes it
almost appear wavy, his fine mournful features, the features of a
very young man; but his large brown eyes are filmy, and look vacantly
at her, while his hands hang meaninglessly down his sides. He has
beautiful features and delicately rounded limbs, yet they are
scratched all over, as if he had rushed through a prickly jungle; an
eastern face, such as we may see in Ceylon or India, with the
pathetic languor of a love-sick woman.</p>

<p>As she regards him, her stern, gloomy features become wonderfully
soft and tender, while his express nothing in return, except
melancholy, as he slowly lifts up one arm and points to sea,
muttering some words which she does not understand; then she holds
her black baby out to him, which he takes mechanically, and as she
turns he follows, like a dog, still carrying the baby, upon which he
looks with gaze as vacant as the milk--satisfied infant regards the
sky above.</p>

<h3>Chapter VI. The "Sunflower."</h3>

<p>NIGGEREE feels a good deal better this morning; one of the
peculiarities of the fever he is slowly fighting down is that one day
you feel as if it had left entirely, and rise without a trace of the
helpless lassitude or ague which seems to be devouring your flesh and
bones; then, as you are joking upon the subject, and wondering that
you could ever feel so low-spirited, the pluck flies from you, and
you sink back sick and faint, or ice-cold and shaking, till every
bone rattles, while the perspiration pours like rain from you. No one
can tell exactly when he has got rid of it, or when it has seized
upon him; a strong, burly man in less than a week may be reduced to
skin and bone.</p>

<p>Last night Niggeree could not do more than sip his grog, and for a
week before that he had tasted neither food or drink, but to-day, as
he springs lightly from his close cabin, when he expected to crawl,
to greet that blushing dawn, he finds himself gifted with an appetite
both for food and drink, drink particularly, and nothing in the
locker to satisfy the tardy craving.</p>

<p>"Confound it all," mutters the Greek, as he prepared to pull off
his shirt so as to enjoy his morning ablutions, "if I only had been
like this last night ashore, I could have enjoyed myself and no
mistake."</p>

<p>As he doffed his garment, a sallow, hollow and high-cheeked Malay
sailor came over to him from the bows with a bucket and line, which
he tossed over the side, bringing it up full, and emptying it with a
sluugh over his skipper, who stood with bent head and back towards
the sailor to receive this primitive shower-bath. Again and again he
drew up the bucket filled, and poured it over, until Niggeree cried,
"enough," after which he joined the other Malay, and went on with
their morning work of swabbing the deck.</p>

<p>As it is impossible to take a plunge in these waters on account of
the sharks, this is the only plan left to those who cannot, like Joe,
dispense with cold water.</p>

<p>"What you have for breakfast this morning, boss?" inquired the
Chinaman who did duty as cook on board the Sunflower,--this Niggeree
called his little vessel,--approaching his master, who was diligently
drying himself.</p>

<p>"No need getting anything for me, I'll go aboard the Thunder and
feed."</p>

<p>"All right, boss," and John returned to his post beside the little
stove which stood on the deck and served for a galley.</p>

<p>If Niggeree, the Greek master of the Sunflower, appeared to be a
weak and undersized man when crouching under the candle-light, a very
different figure stood out against the soft grey background of this
morning sky. By this time he had attired himself in his striped
cotton shirt and white duck pants, and sat on the edge of the
water-cask while he slowly filled his black clay pipe with the
strongest of negrohead; his black, close-set eyes now looked sharp
and bright enough, as he gazed on the shore; a low, square brow, and
head well thatched with close-cropped jet-black hair. Not having
shaved for the past few days, his chin and upper lip were grizzly and
covered with strong dark stubble; a massive chin, with lips thin and
firm-clenched, and when he smiled, as he often did, at some idea
crossing his mind, it gave him the appearance of a convict smiling
upon his jailor. Once he laughed, and muttered something to himself,
and then, when his mouth opened, it disclosed teeth jet-black, and
almost worn to stumps, which, with the blood--coloured gums and lips,
told of the lime and betel chewer. His manner was quiet and sedate,
even when alone, and he never raised his voice, even when giving an
order, but his boys seemed to be on the alert to bear it as soon as
it was uttered. He had a massive neck and square shoulders, with
large arms and legs which made the pants seem to be tight. Since the
night before he seemed to have expanded twice his size, and as the
risen sun kissed him on the cheeks and neck with the same utter want
of distinction as he had touched the satiny shoulders of Queen Ine,
there was no shade of difference between his colour and that of the
bare--chested Malay who was working near to him, only by some
instinct one felt that the tawny tint of the one was imparted by the
sun, and the other was the gift of ages.</p>

<p>"Fetch round the dingey, Jake," he softly said, and the Malay
straightway left his task of polishing the brasswork, and hastened to
obey, while Niggeree, with his pipe now filled, struck a match, which
he held sailor-fashion in the hollow of his hand against the wind,
and having lit, puffed away seriously, looking, as he sat there with
bare arms, legs, and chest, and with head covered with a strip of
turkey red cloth, not a bad ideal of a ruthless pirate.</p>

<p>His vessel, like himself, lay on the waters quietly, yet as if
watchful; the hull low and painted green, sharp as a yacht, and about
as trim, differing only from the other craft lying around by its
rakish look, it being the swiftest sailor, evidently built more for
speed than carrying, a quality which before now Niggeree had found
very useful.</p>

<p>In these little schooners, not bigger than ordinary
fishing-smacks, and much less than some of the deep-sea
herring-boats, traders took their dangerous journeys over the rough
waves of the Papuan Gulf; drawing little water, they served best for
those narrow passages and shoaly patches of the inside reefs. A deck
covered the hold, extending from end to end almost, with the
exception of the three or four feet where the berth of the skipper
was apportioned off. An awning was raised over part of the mid-ships
where, on hot and dry nights, all slept. The berth was used only in
wet weather; and when it was raining the crew slept in the hold if it
was not over-full. The crew was mostly composed of South Sea
Islanders, Malay, or China boys, with the one white man to guide and
control them, so that murder was not so much to be wondered at as the
faithful adherence of these coloured men to their white master; and,
considering the hourly risks ran from natives and other dangers,
treachery was rather a phenomenon; and if at times these brave
traders were not over scrupulous in their means of attaining their
end, still they were, as a rule, easy to please, not hard
task-masters, and, without exception, utterly regardless of
death.</p>

<p>Joe, in his own coarse way, fed and petted his island
employ&eacute;s well, perhaps finding it to his own interest to
indulge them as much as possible, while, if punishment had to be
inflicted, he left it to his wife or the king to do as they thought
best; from motives of selfishness, perhaps, he forbade them
intoxicating drink, and never interfered with the teachings or
influence of the native teachers, so that as much concord and
civilization swayed this island, as on most others subject to the
softening influence of the missionary.</p>

<p>With Niggeree, who hitherto had no abiding-place, but traded from
station to station, staying a month or two on an island, where he
generally ruled recklessly, marrying gaily the most important female
of that part and leaving behind him an aroma of terror and respect,
the other traders found grave fault. As Collins said, he was too
hasty with his Winchester and cutlass, but withal, brave as a lion.
He seemed to regard neither God nor man; he had gone to parts as yet
unopened to the explorer or missionary, where treachery and
man-eating are constantly practised, and from where fearful legends
are wafted of massacres and practices all the more horrible because
veiled in uncertainty; yet he had always returned to contradict the
stories which the natives brought of his death, although he seldom
brought his crew intact.</p>

<p>From years of intercourse, he seemed more at home with the savages
than he would have been with honest citizens, all their habits and
customs had become his own, to which he added other habits, acquired
on the coast of Africa and South America, on the Solomons and South
Sea Islands, and those far-away isles of Greece from where he
originally had drifted.</p>

<p>The Government wanted him very badly, also the representatives of
Exeter Hall; but with the guile of his nation he had hitherto evaded
the traps they had set for him. "Niggeree," as the natives called
him, was a name well known from one end of British New Guinea to the
other, a name to send the nude and dusky warriors and their women
flying into the bush, yet not one of them would bear testimony
against him, what crimes he had committed remaining a secret between
his own conscience and their discretion.</p>

<p>Was he thinking of these dark acts as he quietly sat on that
water-cask, sending up the white puffs from his black clay pipe with
that illuminated warm-toned atmosphere, for he smiled that convict
smile which made him look so like a pirate, or was he concocting
plans for the future? He was down in his luck at present, for this
fever had paralyzed his energies, and he had to lie inactive for
weeks, so that it had all been outcome, and no profit, and the
exchequer was getting low. He had only a few bags of copra to give in
exchange to Bowman for his next three months' supply, and he had not
yet succeeded in winning over young Hector to join his fortune. As he
suspected Hector to know where gold was to be found easily, in spite
of the doubts cast by the colonial public on the nugget he was
supposed to have discovered in New Guinea (for that doubt of the gold
is not shared by a single person who has been in the land), he wanted
to have him near him to find out why the little fellow again sought
the shores, and for other reasons he wished him as a partner. Hector
hitherto had parried his generous offer of a free passage and a share
in his investments, yet to-day Niggeree felt hopeful that he would
succeed in his persuasions.</p>

<p>Hector would be useful in many ways, for since his last scrape
with the Queensland Government, when he, to be able to return, had
been forced to become naturalized, he wanted a British subject to
advise him, now that he was under the power of the commissioner, and
Hector had a cool head, and might steer him safely out of many
perils, and perhaps be the scapegoat if ever the necessity arose to
have one.</p>

<p>Yesterday he was despondent and hopeless, any man might have wrung
his nose with impunity, but to-day he felt the master, and smiled as
he looked towards the canoes and boats; so, having finished his pipe,
and the boat lying alongside with one of the South Sea Islanders at
the oar, and the Malay holding the rope, he sprang to his feet,
stretching himself full up, as he gave orders to those left aboard to
get the bags ready for transferring, and then he dropped lightly into
the dingey, taking the steering oar in his hand, while the others
dipped theirs into the transparent deep blue.</p>

<p>A few strokes and they were absorbed, and lost in the intense
sun-glare which had shortly before swallowed up that black spot,
Joe.</p>

<h3>Chapter VII. A Parting Glass.</h3>

<p>BUSINESS is all arranged now, and the chops, fish, and turtle
steaks are set out on the table-cloth of the saloon, or cabin, of the
Thunder, while the Singalese steward waits meekly at the door for the
masters to take their seats.</p>

<p>Bowman has gone over the copra-bags of Niggeree and the
pearl-shells of Collins, and exchanged the provisions which they
require for their coming cruise, so that in the transfer, many oaths
have been uttered, if not registered amongst the representatives of
western culture, and much chattering and skurrying amongst the dusky
children of uncultivated Nature, who, with their canoes and the
dingies, are still passing between the steamers and the
schooners.</p>

<p>Queen Ine has delivered her orders, and now brother Sam with the
smack Fairy is rapidly becoming a little speck of white upon that
distant sapphire sea, as he speeds away westward to the other
station, to await the commands of his brother-in-law.</p>

<p>They all--that is, all the white men on board, Hans, the engineer,
with his cockney assistant, and Gallacher, the Irish mate--come down
from the poop, and take their seats without distinction. They don't
trouble washing themselves, as they have not bothered about washing
the deck; Captain MacAndrews, with a splitting headache from the
night before, declines taking the head of the table, but sits beside
his dirty mate, in a dejected attitude, wrinkling up his Caledonian
nose with disgust at the sight of food; Bowman has just administered
to him one of his infallible pills. Niggeree sits between Hector and
Collins with his quietest air, for he has succeeded in enlisting
both, Collins by the promise of a hitherto unknown oyster-field near
the mouth of the Fly River, and Hector who has consented because
Collins is going. Hector, agreed to go because he had sailed so far
with Collins, his own vessel lying at present under repair at
Thursday Island.</p>

<p>Joe takes up a lot of room at the foot of the table while Bowman
occupies the head, and Danby, now clad in white pants and undershirt,
with a gay-coloured sash round his waist, sits on the right-hand side
of his friend Bowman.</p>

<p>There are tea and coffee served with brandy instead of milk, and
the Singalese grins when he is called to pull a fresh cork, handing a
slip of paper to the caller to sign: this mild-featured native of
Ceylon is particular about these slips of paper, and always informs
the signers of other slips which they have put their mark to before
but not yet paid, and when he is reviled, he merely laughs, showing
his beautiful teeth, and retires to his sideboard.</p>

<p>Bowman and Danby use their knives and forks, but the others
dispense with these articles of super-refined luxury, and taking the
chops from their plates in their dirty hands, gnaw them like hungry
apes.</p>

<p>Only the captain does not eat; he sits with both hands clutching
his grey, tangled, curly locks, and looks at his greasy plate with
gloomy preoccupation.</p>

<p>Outside the natives squat on the aft-hatch, catching bits of food
thrown to them from the inside, and scrambling laughingly over it;
the coloured sailors take their meal at the bows.</p>

<p>Over against where the captain sits, at the back of Danby, a large
rat darts out at times, and runs along the bunks with impudent
effrontery, its bright eyes glancing at the meat being devoured, as
if it could hardly restrain its wish to join in also; a singular
mixture of boldness and nervous timidity.</p>

<p>Looking up from his plate, the captain sees the rat and starts,
then watches it with a wild eye.</p>

<p>"Is that a rat?" he asks, nudging the mate and pointing to the
crevice where it is just disappearing.</p>

<p>"Of course it is; what did you take it to be?" replied the mate,
glancing up and then going on with his bone.</p>

<p>"I wasn't quite sure if it was a real one," murmured the afflicted
old man, half to himself, as his head sank again over his plate.</p>

<p>A loud laugh followed this murmur, as if the captain had made a
joke.</p>

<p>"Thought you had them, I suppose," observed Danby calmly, after
the laugh had subsided.</p>

<p>"You'll have them before long, young man, if you dinna put in a
peg," said the captain savagely; and rising, he passes out to where
the natives are squatting on the hatchway, kicking two of them out of
the road, and flinging himself down wearily.</p>

<p>Joe, after breakfast, became more interesting than he was the
night before; told of many strange adventures down by the Spanish
main, deeds of daring which were all performed personally, some of
which had been already related in the lives of Captain Kidd and other
bold buccaneers. He evidently had been a very daring pirate in the
olden times, before he became virtuous and settled down upon his
little island.</p>

<p>Then they found that the water supply was short, and another trip
ashore had to be taken, and a rove round the island while the natives
fetched the water.</p>

<p>First to the smoke-house, which stood by the sea-shore; here they
saw the sheet-iron shed used for the purpose, with the closed doors
and ladder reaching up to the loft, where the sea-slugs were laid to
smoke, having been first sun-dried--Joe looking in below to see if
the wooden fires were all right. They sent out a great cloud of
bluish smoke as he peered inside which made all the others fall-to
coughing.</p>

<p>This b&ecirc;che-de-mer, from which they make soup much relished
by the Celestials, is prepared for the Chinese market; the fires are
fed from below, while the fish are laid upon a bamboo floor with
spaces between each spar for the smoke to pass through: about
thirty-six hours are required to smoke them thoroughly.</p>

<p>Outside the shed, and lying on their backs, were three large
turtles, caught the day before. After a deal of bargaining--for Joe,
despite his federal parentage, had all the instincts of his
Israelitish ancestors, for although he denied being a Jew, his nose
asserted his nationality--Bowman bought them for the ship's use, and
another canoe took them aboard.</p>

<p>Then through the thicket--a thicket gorgeous with rare plants and
flowers--they passed to the native village, now deserted of all but
native pets--pigs, dogs, and tame pelicans--who popped out of the way
with ungainly movements as the party looked into the empty huts. The
huts were like Joe's bungalow, only sweeter smelling; cool, dark
places, which the white glare beating upon the sands outside could
not penetrate.</p>

<p>They looked into all the houses excepting one, where the door was
fastened, and before which Joe planted himself with a rough delicacy
not to be expected from him.</p>

<p>"Not there, mates; ye see the poor critter lost her man yesterday,
and I guess she wouldn't like to be disturbed."</p>

<p>On shore they were all resting, and Queen Ine, with her family
about her, sat down beside the women; the Hindoo also sat near to
her, dipping his hand into the yam dish and feeding one of the
twins--the second lot--a little fellow of about sixteen months, who
had crept up close to his feeder and watched him, while he gobbled
down the yams which the other put into his mouth. He had large brown
wondering eyes.</p>

<p>Queen Ine held her head down and looked stolidly at the brown and
white babies clinging to each breast as the party passed, while Joe
explained how the Hindoo was a maniac whom a trader had left with him
at one time as being of no use amongst his crew.</p>

<p>"He had been kidnapped somewhere down there about India, away from
his young wife--so a chap who once stopped here a night and
understands his lingo tells me," explained Joe. "Taken off for a
short voyage, under promise to be sent back soon, then, arter they
had him in Amerikay, they shipped him again to Sydney, telling him
they were taking him home; and then he got drifted from one ship to
another, always thinking he was going home, until he got melancholy
like, as these niggers do, and turned as you see. He's no blarmed bit
o' good, except to look arter the young ones, only he takes fits and
runs off to the woods and stops there all by himself, rushing about
till he gets too hungry to hold out longer, when he comes back and
stands for hours looking out to sea; not a stroke o' good, and feed
extra. I'm now waiting to see if I can get some one to take him off
my hands; and if I don't soon, I'll have to knock his brains out, I
guess, an' be done with it."</p>

<p>Joe is kind, after his nature, but this poor madman's melancholy
makes him miserable, so he wants to have done with it.</p>

<p>The last bottle has been opened on board by the grinning
Singalese, and they wish each other joy and a safe voyage.</p>

<p>The Thunder, with Bowman, Danby and Joe aboard, shrieks out her
steam whistle, at which the afrighted natives tumble into the blue
waters and swim ashore; then the anchor is hauled over the bows, and
the propeller swishes the water into white curd as she ploughs
through the deep passages of the reefs.</p>

<p>The Sunflower and Coral Sea follow each other with sails set, a
fair western monsoon driving them towards New Guinea and the east,
and as they recede--the Thunder sailing in the direction taken by the
Fairy--assuming the proportions and some of the shape of a little tub
as it drifts out of sight slowly. The island falls asleep in the
brilliant midday ray once more, and all seems again as it must have
been before the white man came to devour and pollute.</p>

<h3>Chapter VIII. Hafid and His Little Friend.</h3>

<p>THERE is not much to do on the island now that the ships have
sailed. Some have gone fishing for the sea-slugs, but they will not
be back before sundown, so that only the sun-baking mound has to be
turned--which is being looked after by two or three old women--and
the fires in the smoke-house replenished; this has also been looked
after, while most of the islanders lie basking in the hot light, and
silence broods over all.</p>

<p>Hafid seems amused with his little friend; at least, like a big
dog, he lies passive on his back and lets the child roll about him
and do with him as he pleases.</p>

<p>Queen Ine still sits looking on her children, as these natives,
male and female, will sit for hours without moving, bareheaded with
the sun beating fiercely upon them, languid and indolent until the
moment comes for them to be active, and then they can shake it off
without an effort.</p>

<p>King Primrose, now relieved from the presence of those whom he
wished to impress, had relaxed in his dignity, thrown aside his
military jacket and tile-hat, and now lay amongst the dilapidated
elders of his tribe, smoking the pipe of peace and comfort, while
over them all hung the noonday sun, a small concentrated heat-spot in
the midst of that deep ocean of ultramarine, while the sea and earth
sweltered, and aerial gases rose so that the rocks and trees seemed
to tremble in distance.</p>

<p>After a time Hafid raised himself up, and taking the little fellow
upon his shoulders, slowly went towards the narrow foot-path which
led through the woods to the village, the only place where anything
like shadow was to be found.</p>

<p>On, past the empty houses, and into the deeper intricacies, where
the purple shadows lay in longer patches, and the golden sunshine
fell irregularly, small spots lying like rain-drops on the dewy
shadow--stretches.</p>

<p>With broad green leaves on each side, speckled crotons and tufts
of reed-like grass-growth, the greens here were very fresh, and in
parts the ground felt damp and cool, while bright spring-like tints
lay over the grasses; spotted mosquitoes swarmed over him in dense
clouds as Hafid crossed these swampy places, and the quivering haze
became denser, the under-shades changing to dusky blue and growing
indefinite near the roots of the bushes.</p>

<p>Now and again a gay-plumaged bird flew out of the deep recesses
and sought the higher branches, or it might be a chattering flock of
square--flying snow-white cockatoos making a little cloud-patch in
the open parts of blue sky above the tree-tops; once he nearly trod
upon a bright green snake as it lazily crawled across the path and
became lost amongst the reeds, but Hafid went on seemingly tireless,
with that straight look-out in his melancholy eyes, as if he was
seeking for the woman he had lost, while the naked child, perched
upon his shoulder like a little brown ape, clutched at the leaves
above its head, trying to catch the large gay--coloured butterflies
as they circled round him, or the flowers and bright scarlet, white,
and blue berries which trembled upon the swinging tendrils.</p>

<p>At last they came to a small recess where they had been often
before, where the shadows were very dense, and the ground rose to a
sort of bank; in front of them spread a swampy piece of ground with
the sun shining full upon it, where butterflies in thousands kept up
a perpetual motion and uncertain glitter above the lilies and swamp
flowers; while perfect clouds of gnats and mosquitoes swarmed and
kept up a drowsy chorus.</p>

<p>Here Hafid lay down with his head on the shady bank and his feet
in a sunlit pool of water, and the solitary game of tumble on the
part of the boy recommenced.</p>

<p>Savage hordes of hungry tiger-mosquitoes darted upon the lithe
naked body and exposed limbs of Hafid, without disturbing either in
the slightest degree; lizards large and small, of all shades, darted
over the sunny lines, while ants ran about with the important fussy
air of city clerks--and all the time the sun rolled along on his
daily round, making as he descended the western plains, shadows
longer in that tropic retreat.</p>

<p>The boy was tired of his game, and Hafid had fallen asleep, and so
the youth looked about him for some other mode of amusement.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>Meanwhile, on the sea-shore, work had recommenced, and Queen Ine,
putting her children once more under the charge of the old crone,
became the active over-seer; the fishing canoes had returned as the
sun grew orange-toned in the west, and all hands were required to
unload and prepare the slugs for next day's drying.</p>

<p>So from one group to another she sprang, now in the smoke-house,
hauling out the dried slugs, now pushing her useless old father out
of her road, or superintending the spreading and cutting up of the
b&ecirc;che-de-mer. She did not spare her own lithe body any more
than the serfs about her.</p>

<p>All was about over by the time Hafid came to view, this time
carrying the child as if asleep in his arms. Queen Ine merely glanced
at him as he laid down his little friend beside the other tired-out
children, and went on with her work, while Hafid passed over to the
sea, wading out a space till the rising tide came over his knees, and
watching the crimson sun sinking below the dark belt of purple ocean
over beyond the surf-line of the distant reefs.</p>

<p>She had finished, and the labourers slowly left the beach in their
family groups, and went towards the village, while with a careful
look round to see if all was rightly done, she turned towards her
sleeping children, and prepared herself to take them indoors.</p>

<p>The old crone took up the two eldest twins, and after laying them
down on one of the bamboo couches, came back for the others, while
Queen Ine, meanwhile, had picked up the youngest.</p>

<p>At this moment the old woman uttered a howl that startled the
younger woman and made her turn round, wondering what was the
matter.</p>

<p>The old woman was holding up a little clenched hand of Hafid's
friend, from which she was trying to pluck some bright-tinted
berries.</p>

<p>In a moment the apathy of Queen Ine had disappeared, and she
became the distracted mother; with a wild cry, which echoed through
the woods and startled the sleeping parrots, while it arrested the
dragging feet of the villagers, she flung down the infants, and
sprang to the side of the unconscious child.</p>

<p>Some wild words were uttered and answered, as she stooped down to
smell the mouth all tinted with the bright colour of the berries,
while she clutched up the child, and flew backwards and forwards on
the sea-shore, uttering screams which became hoarser each repetition.
The old woman ran as fast as possible towards the village.</p>

<p>Hafid, meanwhile, stood motionless near the sea-shore up to his
knees in water, with the twilight fumes of rosy purple folding him up
as with a mantle.</p>

<h3>Chapter IX. Hafid Again on the Road Home.</h3>

<p>IT is vain to attempt to describe the agony of the woman when the
child she has brought into the world is passing from it, no matter
her condition or nationality, if she be a woman.</p>

<p>Queen Ine was a woman with all the savage instincts of maternity
in full force within her--a savage in every emotion, and the dying
child was her own flesh, being torn from her by the remorseless enemy
Death; a woman without one consolation, for the South Sea Island
teacher who tried his best to comfort, had not learnt enough of his
lately-taught creed to translate to her those passages whereby the
pastor seeks to alieviate the heavy woe.</p>

<p>From her arms the child had not stirred all through the night, and
the antidote which the old woman had rushed off to the village to
procure, had been administered too late to be of any service against
the subtle effect of the poisoned berries. Every three of the little
body had cut the heart of the mother; yet, after the first wild
madness of the discovery, she became silent, and only the fierce
clutching with her hand at her throat or the sullen bloodshot eyes
betrayed how much the mother felt.</p>

<p>All her other children were as nothing to her now, only this one
lying so still in her lap with its dimming eyes fixed on space. Her
own tearless ones were like flame watching each step of the
approaching enemy.</p>

<p>Hafid had disappeared before morning, unconscious of the disaster
he had brought upon his benefactress; he wandered, as was his wont,
over the most unfrequented portions of the island, and as yet no one
had sought for him. By-and-by, however, when the child was dead,
their wrath would turn to his direction, and he would be hunted down
and offered as a victim to their vengeance.</p>

<p>Emir, the native teacher, would not seek to prevent this action of
savage vengeance; to him it would seem all right and proper, in spite
of his Christianity.</p>

<p>The sun was warming in the west when the end came. On the
sea-shore they all sat silent, except the teacher, who did what he
thought right under the circumstances, sang his native hymns and read
at random from his native testament.</p>

<p>The tribe was assembled waiting on the death, before they began to
weep and lament. Death was a very common visitor with them, and was
treated by all except those most interested in a very callous manner;
there was no use in wasting any time before the right moment
arrived.</p>

<p>Children die easy, and so would this one if they had not tried to
save him. Their united efforts increased the torture by prolonging
it, but now it was all over, and while the mother's hot eyes still
look upon the little tawny ashen face and glazing eyes, the limp
limbs are becoming stiff and cold.</p>

<p>Then the ceremony of lamenting begins, while the young men with
their spears scatter to hunt for the poor unconscious Hafid; they
will do their hour of weeping after they have found him.</p>

<p>But Queen Ine does not weep, or take her eyes away from her dead
child. The old woman tries to lift it away, but desists at the wild
clutch the mother's hands make upon it, and instead, puts the
youngest children by turns to the full, throbbing breasts, where she
holds them while they drink, for the mother pays no attention.</p>

<p>It is about the hour when Joe should return, and some of those who
have done their time of lamenting set about preparing for his coming
back, while others hold up their hands to their eyes, shading them
from the declining sun, to catch the first sight of him; but Queen
Ine orders or threatens them no more.</p>

<p>By-and-by some of the watchers say they see it, and with it the
fire--ship, as they call the steamer, and they all begin to bustle
about.</p>

<p>There they are together, the Thunder towing the other along in her
wake. Joe has been drinking and swearing, and trying to cheat and lie
all day, while his child has been suffering the agonies of death.</p>

<p>A little grey speck, which looms up against the grey undersides of
the cloud-bank below the mellow sun-circle, growing from the grey
blue to black, separates as the golden orb gets behind it; then
nearer every moment, until the dark funnels and masters of the two
vessels are easily distinguished, as the amber-brown smoke rolls
around that orange and dun space, where the great eye of day is
rapidly turning bloodshot as it is nearing that clean-cut line of
horizon.</p>

<p>It seems hours to the watchers on shore before they can hear the
lashing of the monster's iron tail. Then the yelling and curses of
the captain and mate, and dropping of the anchor, intermingle with
the blood-thirsty yellings of those ashore who cluster round the
prisoner Hafid, dragged by the young men from his retreat in the
woods.</p>

<p>"There's something up over there, Joe," remarks Bowman to Joe, as
he sees to his revolvers being ready, before he drops into the
dingey, inside which the nearly intoxicated Joe is sitting
waiting.</p>

<p>"I'll soon settle all that once we land," answers Joe easily, and
they pull off towards the excited group.</p>

<p>"Eternal Thunder, what's all this about?" yelled Joe, staggering
up towards the group where Queen Ine sits with her dead child, and
the natives are gesticulating about their prisoner, whom he does not
yet see.</p>

<p>He stops and lays a heavy, uncertain grip on the black shoulders
of his wife, as he lurches forward and prepares himself to be
delivered of a volley of oaths, when something in the face she turns
up to him partly sobers him, and then he looks into her lap and knows
all about it.</p>

<p>Queen Ine looks into his face mutely for a moment with the agony
of a wounded doe, while he stands swaying to and fro, passing his
helpless, horny hand over his drink-dazed eyes and through his beard.
Then her eyes drop once more, as if she had not found what she sought
for in those brutal features; perhaps she did not look for bread,
although she did not like the stone.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bowman and Danby drew near, and, the dead being only a
black child, did not display much interest in it.</p>

<p>Then Joe, whose grief found vent in a fresh volley of curses,
asked how it happened, and when one of the natives told him, and
pointed to the nearly naked Hindoo standing amongst them, all
unconscious of his offence and danger, he turned to where Bowman
stood and said,--</p>

<p>"I told you as how that blamed nigger would bring me no luck, and
now he has done it, and my wench won't be no good for work for the
next month. Poor little man! Blast my blooming eyes."</p>

<p>Something like two drops of water gleamed in Joe's bloodshot eyes
as he spoke, but he was ashamed of giving way before his friends.</p>

<p>"What are they going to do to the Hindoo?" asked Bowman.</p>

<p>"Kill him, for certain; may be, roast and eat him."</p>

<p>"No, no! we must not let them."</p>

<p>"I can't stop 'em when their blood's up; it's more than my head's
worth. Only Queen Ine could do it, and it's not likely she will."</p>

<p>But Queen Ine belied his idea of her; her heart was too full of
woe for any thought of vengeance to stay there, for as Joe spoke she
lifted up her dead baby in her arms, and going over to where her
tribe stood about their captive, cleared a passage, and taking him by
the arm, led him over to where Bowman stood, none disputing her right
to dispose of the captive.</p>

<p>"You white fellow, take him away in fire-ship," she said, in the
best English she could muster, her voice so husky and dry that Bowman
had not the heart to refuse.</p>

<p>"Go way when sun rises. No let them kill Hafid, he good fellow;
but take him away."</p>

<p>She returned to her seat on the ground, but this time when the old
woman approached she took both infants into her arms, and permitted
the other to take the dead baby indoors. She did not look at her
husband any more, but bent her head over her little ones as they hung
at each breast, so that they could not see her face.</p>

<p>"Best take the idiot aboard at once," advised Joe. "I'll come with
you; it feels too blasted lonesome to-night on this yer island, and
Queen Ine is best by herself."</p>

<p>Joe slunk to the stern after the others, and said no more till he
came aboard, when he straightway set to drown his grief in the only
way he knew, which no one sought to deny him. Hafid went forward
amongst the other coloured men, and appeared pleased to think he was
once more on his way over the seas to find his home. And the others,
having already had tea before landing, proceeded to fill their pipes,
and lighting up, went up the companion-way to the poop to enjoy the
evening breeze.</p>

<p>The young horned moon was slowly sinking below the horizon, and
the green and rosy short-lived twilight colours were spreading over
the sky.</p>

<p>On shore, in front of the fire, they could see the dark figures
squatting, or passing to and fro, and loud sounds of weeping were
wafted on the balmy air, blowing the aromatic perfume of burning
palm-wood and dulse towards them; fresh arrivals dropping in and
joining in the funeral service. And at the sight Joe swore a savage
oath, and called for more brandy, which the steward brought to him
without the usual slip of paper.</p>

<p>But they were too far off, and the night was getting too dark for
them to see the figure which crouched all by itself down by the
sea-shore amongst the shells.</p>

<p>Her dead child was being buried by her relations and friends, and
her other children were asleep in the bungalow, so that she had come
down to the sea-beach to be alone.</p>

<p>And the wind sighed round her from the land, while the little
wavelets lapped and splashed about the skirts of her cotton gown and
over her bare feet, and the world above her became luminous with
moist pitying eyes, which she did not see, for her head was buried in
the folds of her gown as it rumpled between her knees. The sounds of
the weeping fell unheeded on her ear, for she knew that they meant
nothing; but a shudder passed over her back, as the gruff intonation
of Joe's curses rolled brokenly in from the deck of the steamer upon
the returning breezes, and struck her ear.</p>

<h3>Chapter X. Hula.--A Lover's Quarrel.</h3>

<p>ALL the names given by the natives of New Guinea are euphony
itself--Elevira, Hanuabada, Aroma, Kerepuna, Piramata, &amp;c. The
Colonial Government are planning out a city at Port Moresby, i.e.
Elevira or Hanuabada, which they propose to call Grenville.</p>

<p>Hula, the native town, on the sea, where the houses stand out from
the shore on their tall piles, and the highways are, like the
highways of Venice, blue ocean. On shore the Sistu tribe resides,
surrounded by orchards and lovely gardens, with the lofty mountains
of the mainland soaring up to the clouds and hiding the vast aerial
mysteries of the yet unexplored Owen Stanley ranges.</p>

<p>The shore tribes of Hula are hunters and gardeners, bold traders
who go westward with their wares in their large trading Lakatoes, as
the ancient tribes of Greece traded their merchandise, facing, like
them, dangers by sea and land, from robbers, murderers, and pirates,
and, like them, they are all warriors as well as workmen.</p>

<p>The sea tribes live by fishing, which they also barter.</p>

<p>Love and war mingle up with their hourly avocations, and they take
their pleasures and do their work as the Jews did at the rebuilding
of Jerusalem, with one hand on the spade and the other on their
spear.</p>

<p>It is a rest-day at Hula, and they are all enjoying the glory of
the sun, cooled by the strong sea-breeze, in the way they like
best--wrestling, sailing their large and small vessels about,
practising with the bow or spear, running races, smoking, telling
tales, or making love to the girls who are cutting up the taro, yams,
and bananas for the modest mid-day meal.</p>

<p>One youth, who has been the length of Brisbane in the bom-bom or
war-sloop, tells the wonders he has seen to a group who listen
open--mouthed to some of his tales or laugh incredulously at others.
They have all seen a screw-steamer in Hula before, and are partly
prepared for the other wonders he tells, the strange sight of houses
built one above the other, and bridges crossing large rivers, of
horses carrying men, and coaches, but they openly laugh to scorn his
description of the trains; there, like the sailor's mother when he
told her about the fish that had wings, they drew the line.</p>

<p>"You know the fire-ship that thump-thumps and kicks the water all
white, well they have beasts the same, who puff-puff like that, and
swallow up hundreds of men as they run up mountains and over the big
fields, big snakes who smoke the bau-bau."</p>

<p>A loud burst of incredulous shouts greeted this wonderful tale, so
that "Kamo," the narrator, was fain to walk off in a dignified way to
console himself as best he could with the society of his future wife,
who, by reason of her position as an engaged young lady, was exempt
from all work, and now lay on the outside of the circle of
yam-preparers basking her dainty limbs in the sun with all the
abandonment of perfect idleness.</p>

<p>Kamo, a tall boy of about eighteen, like all the male portion of
New Guinea, was perfectly naked, with the exception of the elaborate
breast and nose ornaments, earrings, and armlets. His bushy and
frizzed hair, standing about two feet all round his smooth, comely
face, was adorned with scarlet blossoms, like the wreaths which the
ancients were at their love-feasts, dyed of a golden hue by his girl,
and with the long-handled comb stuck rakishly on one side--a splendid
specimen of uncurbed, fresh young humanity, he strode along the
sands, swinging his highly--decorated bau-bau or pipe, in his hand,
and looking at the shadow which fell from his handsome limbs with
evident satisfaction.</p>

<p>Rea, his young lady, watched his approach with half-sleepy
admiration. She had picked him out from many other handsome youths,
impressed by the sense of his superior knowledge, and treated him
with more consideration than New Guinea girls generally display
towards their expectant husbands; but, in spite of her evident awe at
his fame as a traveller, she was not inclined to be too amiable, but
led him an uncertain dance while he waited his appointed month of
probation, it being the custom, after preliminary arrangements are
got over, such as satisfying the parents as to means, &amp;c., to put
the suitor under trial, that is, the youth has to deliver himself
over, body and soul, to the caprices of his intended partner, live in
her father's house, and be for ever on his good behaviour.</p>

<p>Kamo was a very wealthy young man, according to these parts. He
had much tobacco, and some pearl-shells, with other treasures gleaned
in his travels, and so he was greatly respected, and, to use a vulgar
expression, thought no small beer of himself.</p>

<p>Rea, his betrothed, was also an heiress, her father being chief of
the land tribe, with an orchard all her own since her mother's death;
a dainty little girl of sixteen, tattooed to the waist in beautiful
designs of blue upon brown, hair cut short and curly (when she is
married she will shave it all off), a pert round face, with little
nose, full red lips, and teeth only as yet slightly stained with the
betel-nut, large brown mischief-loving eyes, small ears, even
although the lobes hung down rather far to suit European tastes, yet
here it was considered a mark of beauty to have lobes hanging down
and weighted with shell earrings.</p>

<p>Her figure was plump, although, compared with the Apollo-like
proportions of her lover, somewhat undersized, yet the feet now
kicking petulantly at the sands were small and beautifully formed.
She had not so many ornaments about her as Kamo had--as here it is
the custom of the male, like the gorgeous male birds of Paradise, to
look as splendid as possible--her only dress consisting of the
"Raumma," or bulky grass petticoat, which fell from her waist to her
knees in many folds, giving her a bunchy appearance round the hips,
and making her lower limbs appear much less than they really
were.</p>

<p>She was gazing at Kamo with indolent admiration as he left the
group of unbelievers with that lordly air of his, feeling all the
pride of easy possession; but as he came nearer she drew her brows
together and the corners of her little mouth down in the manner of a
spoilt, petted child, which, when the young man saw, made him slacken
his pace, and seemed to take a considerable lot of the swagger out of
him.</p>

<p>He ceased to swing his bau-bau, and drew near with a conciliatory
air, almost fawning in its humility.</p>

<p>"How much longer have I to wait for you, Kamo, while you tell lies
to the men and make them laugh at you?" exclaimed this spoiled beauty
in an angry voice.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you wanted me to come, Rea. You know you said you
were tired of hearing about the white man's great places, and wanted
to sleep."</p>

<p>"Of course I am sick of all these things. Do you think no one
except you has been out of Hula?"</p>

<p>Kamo did not answer, being a wise youth, who could afford to wait
his time.</p>

<p>"Well, have you nothing to tell me, Kamo, now that you are here?"
she inquired, still offended, or pretending to be so, as he took his
place beside her on the sands.</p>

<p>"Only that I wish my month was over, and I had you all to myself,"
replied Kamo, trying to take her hand, which she snatched from
him.</p>

<p>"I don't; it's too pleasant to lie about and do nothing all day,
and I haven't yet made up my mind whether you are worth working for.
Perhaps I'll turn you over like Mea did Rika."</p>

<p>"No, Rea, you would not do that to me, for I know the road to the
white man now, and I'd go away and never see Hula again."</p>

<p>"I would not care about that, you may depend, if I sent you from
me; there are plenty of fine boys in Hula."</p>

<p>"Would you kill me, Rea?"</p>

<p>"I'll think about it; but you must be more amusing, or I'll not
take you."</p>

<p>"I'll do whatever you like, Rea."</p>

<p>"Then carry me through the streets. I want to find out how it
feels like, on the beast you call a horse."</p>

<p>Poor Kamo cast a rueful glance round at the other youths and
maidens, for he knew how they would jeer at him if he did this, and
said,--</p>

<p>"Wouldn't a sail be nicer, Rea? Come, we will go over the sea in
my new canoe."</p>

<p>"No, I want a ride, and you must be my horse, and take me all
round the village."</p>

<p>Kamo felt he must obey, so with a deep sigh of resignation he put
down his bau-bau and put his arms about her to lift her up, when she
stopped him.</p>

<p>"Not that way; I want you to go the way you showed us the horses
went."</p>

<p>Kamo remembered, with a shudder, how he had run all-fours to
illustrate the horse, one night when they were merry, and cursed his
vanity when he remembered his pride at being the hero. That was weeks
ago, when he first came home and his stories were listened to.</p>

<p>"Well, boy, are you going to do it, or must I go to my father?"
cried the maiden, impatiently. And at this dire threat Kamo bent his
back meekly, and went on his hands and knees, while Rea, gathering
her skirts well around her and taking up the ornamented bau-bau in
lieu of a whip, sat down upon him, and hitting him smartly over the
shoulders, told him to "Gee up!" as he had said the white man did
with his horses.</p>

<p>On went poor Kamo under his loved but not fairy-like load, panting
and sweating with the heat of the sun and the exertion and the shame
before him, while Rea sat calmly and contented with her new mode of
torture.</p>

<p>She did not spare either his back or his shoulders, and he dared
not complain. The motion pleased her, and she considered nothing
about her horse except a wicked little thrill of pleasure at the
thought of this novel mode of tormenting him.</p>

<p>And all the village men and boys left their sports and their
talking to watch and laugh at this new spectacle; the old women stood
up with their knives in one hand and the half-peeled yam in the
other, laughing at the fun, even while they were thinking how soon
Rea's reign of tyranny would be over; while the younger maidens
forsook the cooking-pots altogether, and followed jeering and
laughing at the fool Rea was making of her lover, and wishing the
time had come when they could torment a lover also.</p>

<p>The father of Rea also followed, laughing like the rest, but
keeping a sharp look-out on the pair, as fathers and mothers in these
parts do during courting season.</p>

<p>And in the midst of the yelling and hooting crowd Rea sat unmoved,
urging on her unlucky victim with vicious little pinches and kicks,
as well as blows from the bamboo-pipe, while he groaned in spirit as
he ambled on with shell-cut hands and feet, his hair filled with
sand, and the hibiscus blossoms all tumbled about.</p>

<p>"On, beast, on!" shouted Rea, spurring up those jaded limbs until
his heart was sore with the exertion, while the crowd of girls flung
more sand over him and shouted,--</p>

<p>"Yes, on, you beast!"</p>

<p>How long it might have lasted, who knows--for Rea felt the heroine
of the hour, and liked the motion too well for any thought of her
victim to enter her curly little head--had not a lucky idea struck
the throbbing brain of Kamo of a horse he had once seen throw his
rider.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was desperation prompted the idea, for he felt he must
sink down with exhaustion if he went on longer, or the sight of a
nice soft green mound of grass right before him, or maybe the wicked
grin on the ugly face of Toto, who stood at hand in his gay suit of
orange and red, leering at the girl bestriding him; but he instantly
acted upon it, kicking up his heels in the air at the moment that the
smiling Rea was least expecting such a motion, and landing her
unhurt, but ignominiously, right in the centre of the grass tuft.</p>

<p>"That is the way the horses do," gasped Kamo, getting up and
shaking himself, while all the natives laughed at Rea.</p>

<p>Rea, who had fallen in a most ungraceful attitude, picked herself
quickly up, and, first adjusting her raumma, ran up to him with
blazing eves.</p>

<p>"And that's what I do, you beast!"</p>

<p>With both hands she slapped him full on each cheek, and walked off
towards the gardens, leaving poor Kamo shamefaced and dejected, with
smarting cheeks and a growing consciousness that it would have been
better if he had played the patient instead of the kicking steed.</p>

<h3>Chapter XI. Toto Remembers One of the Christian Virtues, and
Forgives.</h3>

<p>THERE was a wealthier man in Hula than Kamo, albeit not nearly so
well liked, yet riches are always treated with some respect amongst
savages, as they are with more civilized communities.</p>

<p>Toto was not a pretty man, in spite of his most gorgeous costume
as he stood there, grinning at Kamo and leering upon Rea.</p>

<p>A strong-built fellow, with the face of a libertine, mingled with
all the cunning of the treacherous savage; his nose resembled the
nose of a Tartar, and his eyes were elongated and appeared as if
lashless, with a most unpleasant droop at the outer corners; his
mouth also was very large and slobbery-looking from the constant
habit of betel chewing, and looked like a freshly jagged wound, wide,
gaping, and showing the scarlet gums and stumps of blackened tusks
behind.</p>

<p>He was the only man dressed in Hula, excepting the
freshly-installed South Sea Island teacher, who had lately arrived
with his pretty young wife to take the post from which Toto had been
deposed.</p>

<p>Toto was the only Papuan who could read and write in Hula;
formerly he had been taken in hand by the missionaries and educated
to become a teacher amongst his people, almost the first New Guinea
native who had been converted.</p>

<p>After his training at Port Moresby, he had been sent down amongst
his own kindred and people, to continue the good work; but, alas!
Toto had been only half-redeemed when let loose, and soon relapsed
into something worse than his original uncultivated state.</p>

<p>Toto, like the other native teachers, had been allowed twenty
pounds a year to maintain himself and family--ample means for him
amongst his own tribe, where he had his own portion of land, although
barely sufficient for the poor strangers, who were compelled to buy
everything they required at the prices fixed by the natives and
traders. The Papuan being close-fisted and yielding nothing out of
charity, these poor South Sea Islanders come with their wives amongst
people callous, if not regarding them as intruders. They spend their
year's allowance in less than four months, and then half starve the
rest of the year, working on bravely and uncomplainingly upon this
arid soil, till their wives droop and die, or themselves are murdered
and eaten.</p>

<p>Toto was not the man to make a martyr of himself, and being
worldly wise, after getting all he could out of the mission-station,
a pretty young wife (he had left one at Hula working in his garden
while he was being converted), and his first instalment of salary, he
took up his position, and cast about for other methods to increase
his meagre income.</p>

<p>Under the protection of the missionary he became a power in his
own land, while the hymns he sang drew the young boys and girls to
his house, which he got built large and commodious. When traders came
they applied to Toto, as mediator between them and the tribe, getting
him to drive the bargains for them, so that he was paid both ways,
deceiving all round, in the feathering of his own nest.</p>

<p>By-and-by, as time went on, Toto learnt that which they, his
people, have not yet learnt, the use of money direct; he got to know
what these rough sailors wanted besides copra and curios, and by
stages became the pander to their vices, turning the mission-house
into a place of ungodly riot, under the cloak of his supposed office
of assistant teacher, and making the name of Hula vile throughout the
land.</p>

<p>He was an unbounded hypocrite, and knew how to fawn and hold the
key as well as any keeper of houses of the same description in
European towns, without being as yet suspected either by the
missionaries or the honest people he was daily betraying, while
laying up treasures of iniquity.</p>

<p>The girls he taught by degrees those lessons of duplicity, so that
they might hood wink their husbands and parents, and the cunning
scoundrel knew by all the instincts of the trained pander whom to
approach.</p>

<p>By-and-by, however, rumours reached headquarters, and he was
dismissed at once ignominiously from the office which he had defiled,
yet not before he had made enough to treat their dismissal with
grinning contempt. He had established his name, and had plenty of
customers, while the natives could not help respecting his riches,
even though they had sprung from their dead honour. Toto could still
swagger about in the gay garments which the traders brought to him,
and awe his people with his splendours, while his courtyard was
seldom empty of visitors.</p>

<p>His South Sea Island spouse had died some time before this, worn
down with the hardships of her life amongst these unsympathetic
strangers and killed at last by fever and neglect. The wife he had
left behind was getting too old for Toto, so some time before Kamo
had returned he had been one of the suitors for the hand of Rea.</p>

<p>But in Hula, as throughout all New Guinea, women, although finally
bought, are permitted to make their own choice, so that Toto,
favourably received by the father for the sake of his wealth, had
been rudely dismissed by the wilful young lady, who had a good
knowledge of Toto's profession, and hated him accordingly.</p>

<p>Still he leared upon her and made disgusting remarks when he met
her alone, and had not given up hopes even after Kamo appeared.</p>

<p>When Kamo came to himself, after his chastisement and the abrupt
departure of Rea, the first object that met his moody eyes was the
large yellow and red-striped pants of this abhorred, would-be
rival.</p>

<p>The colour upon him had the effect of red upon an excitable bull.
Slowly his eyes wandered up to the evil, open mouth of the
betel--chewing pander, and he fixed upon the opportunity to avenge
the insults which Rea had told him about.</p>

<p>The tribe all round were still laughing merrily at the late scene,
and Toto, thinking the quarrel meant fresh hopes for him, also swayed
from side to side indulging in silent bursts of malicious mirth.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at, you pig?" shouted Kamo, coming up to
within an inch of Toto's sallow Chinese-looking face, and clenching
his fist.</p>

<p>Toto could not stop all of a moment, besides he did not think
there was any necessity, Kamo was such a boy compared with him.</p>

<p>"At the funny figure you cut on your knees--"</p>

<p>He did not finish his little joke, for Kamo's fist had rattled
against his gums, and the men gathered round to separate them,
knowing that Kamo was no match for the other; but Toto did not strike
back, he had learnt one lesson at Port Moresby, to control his
temper.</p>

<p>The leering grin became intensified with the swelling lips, as he
wiped the blood away with his gaudy sleeves; but he only nodded his
head at Kamo, and said,--</p>

<p>"We'll settle all this by-and-by, Kamo, my boy; you just wait and
see." Then he hitched up his trousers, and went down past the crowd
towards his own house, while Kamo and the others looked after him,
marvelling at his Christian forbearance.</p>

<p>Once, as he nearly reached his door, he looked back and waved his
hand towards them; appearing still to be laughing, but with his lips
bulged out.</p>

<h3>Chapter XII. In the Gardens of Hula.--The Reconciliation.</h3>

<p>REA ran, with burning cheeks and flaming eyes, straight out of the
village, shame in her little heart at her discomfiture, and wild
hatred for the man who had affronted her, never stopping until she
had reached the spring in the woods, over by the gardens, where the
women came night and morning to fetch water.</p>

<p>There she flung herself face downwards on the moist grass, tearing
it out by handfuls, and howling in her savage passion.</p>

<p>It was a new experience to this spoilt young beauty of Hula to be
treated in this way. Of course she knew that after her marriage she
would have to work, and submit in some things to her husband; but,
before that came to pass, all precedent had proved to her that men
were slaves, and that she ought to make the most of her time, as
other girls did. It was nothing to torment and hurt her lover; that
was what they all had to expect when they went courting, but to be
herself humiliated before her people in that way was too much to
endure.</p>

<p>"I will give him up at once and for ever," she cried savagely. For
ever! The two last weeks had been very pleasant weeks, and there was
no one to compare with Kamo in Hula. Perhaps his wanderings amongst
white men had spoilt him, for she remembered that Kamo had told her
that white men treated their girls differently.</p>

<p>"What fools these white women must be," she thought, "to be tender
to their lovers, and let them bully them from the first. Have not all
women to suffer after they are married? And it is only right that the
men should have their share beforehand."</p>

<p>Kamo had told her that he had seen the men in Brisbane knock down
their women and kick them; and she now remembered all these horrors,
and wondered if this was only a foretaste of her future if she
married him, for in New Guinea the husbands were always kind to their
wives, and only fought amongst themselves.</p>

<p>"No, he would never dare go that length, nor will I give him the
chance."</p>

<p>As Rea thought over these things she recalled how handsome he
looked that morning when he came over to her, and at the prospect of
giving him up the fire in her brown eyes became quenched with the
tears which welled up from her sore little heart and rolled down her
tawny cheeks, and she left off kicking with her toes and tearing out
the grass with her hands, and, crossing her bare brown arms under her
face, did exactly as a white maiden would have done under the same
circumstances, namely, had a hearty crying match, pitying her own
sweet self very much, and feeling very desolate, with the wish that
she was dead.</p>

<p>"Rea," murmured a soft voice in her ear, which made her leap up,
ashamed at being caught crying, to find the wicked face of Toto near
her. He had quietly crept up beside her, and sat himself down on a
tree-stump by the edge of the spring, and looking as sympathetic as
his swollen mouth and evil eyes could allow him to look. "Don't run
away, Rea; I saw what Kamo did to you, and got this for taking your
part."</p>

<p>He pointed to his cut mouth, and at the sight Rea felt a gentle
thrill of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Did he fight with you about me?"</p>

<p>"He struck me, Rea," answered Toto meekly.</p>

<p>"And did you hurt him much?"</p>

<p>"No, Rea; I did not touch him."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>A wealth of scorn was in the question. She knew Toto was a strong
man, and had feared that Kamo was hurt in the encounter; but she
could not understand a man not striking back. The little savage did
not understand the Christian principle of forgiveness, although her
heart had already endorsed it towards the recreant Kamo.</p>

<p>"I thought on a better way, whereby you and I together might hurt
him much worse," replied Toto, in a soft voice.</p>

<p>"In what way, Toto?"</p>

<p>Rea was on her guard now, and all her anger forgotten.</p>

<p>"I know a man who could take Kamo away from Hula, and give you and
me a big present for him; he will soon be here now, before another
moon. But you hate Kamo now, don't you, Rea?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; but go on, Toto," impatiently answered Rea, stamping
her foot.</p>

<p>"And if you will come to my place now and then, when the white
fellows come, you may soon have as much money as Kamo has--"</p>

<p>What Rea's reply might have been Toto could not say, and never got
the chance of hearing; for, while he tried to meet her glance as she
looked steadfastly towards her feet, he gave a sudden cry, which
caused the maiden to look up startled, and to find Kamo standing over
his prostrate enemy, his club in his hand splashed with blood.</p>

<p>Rea looked upon her lover as he stood there like a young god, his
eyes blazing and his nostrils quivering. Then a great timidity and
fear crept over her, as he turned his eyes from the half-conscious
Toto, who had now sat up trying to collect his scattered senses and
clear his eyes from the blood which ran down his forehead and nearly
blinded him.</p>

<p>"What was Toto saying to you, Rea?" he demanded fiercely.</p>

<p>Rea breathed once more; he had not heard the infamous
proposal.</p>

<p>"Nothing, Kamo."</p>

<p>"Toto doesn't come to say nothing."</p>

<p>Toto by this time had risen to his feet, and stood at a convenient
distance from the lovers. He replied for Rea. "I was asking Rea to
marry me now she is done with you."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Kamo remembered that he was a sinner, and became limp and
dejected at these words. Had she given him up? It seemed a small
fault for so hard a punishment, and yet, according to the Hula code
of morality, he dare not appeal against it, Rea being still mistress
of her own fate.</p>

<p>"Then I had better go," said Kamo, sadly, "since you give me up,
Rea; only I'll kill you, Toto, before you can get her."</p>

<p>"Don't go, Kamo; he is telling lies. You know, Kamo, I would not
marry him if there was not another man to have, although I don't like
you any longer."</p>

<p>"Then tell him to go, if he won't fight me now," said Kamo,
sternly.</p>

<p>Toto did not wait to be ordered off the field. He was a big man,
but he did not care to contend in battle for Rea or any other woman,
and that single taste of Kamo's club seemed to be enough in one day
for him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll go now, Rea, and will get your answer some other time,"
said Toto, going off as he spoke. He did not feel at all easy in his
mind as to what Rea might tell Kamo, but on the whole trusted to
chance. If his little plan were revealed he could always say it was a
joke, and accomplish his purpose when his friend Niggeree came, as he
expected him before long.</p>

<p>There are cowards in New Guinea as in other portions of the world,
and Toto, in spite of his great size and superior education, was a
rank craven; he had no taste for the standing accomplishments of his
country, and would much rather run away than fight any day. Although
not now a model Christian, he still adhered to the tenets of the new
creed which he had been taught, and liked peace.</p>

<p>Kamo looked after him, with a scornful smile, as he slunk into the
cover like a wounded snake, while Rea, watching her lover out of the
corners of her eyes, and mentally comparing the two, decided that
after a little penance she would give Kamo one more trial.</p>

<p>There is no need to describe this penance laid upon the unhappy
sinner. She made all her conditions hard ones, which he consented to
perform to the letter. He was to go that night into the bush, and
stay there till morning amongst the ghosts. Kamo did not mind this so
much as she thought he would, as a great deal of his early
superstitions had been brushed away by his contact with the white
people, but he was too cunning to let her know of this, and so
pretended to be very frightened, which mollified her greatly.</p>

<p>She did not mention what Toto had told her, for she trusted to her
superior wit to defeat his vile projects when the time came; besides,
she feared for Kamo if he again met Toto, for she could not believe
in one man being frightened at another, it was only the women they
ought to fear and respect.</p>

<p>They had both missed dinner by the time peace was made up, and the
sun was sending horizontal shafts of gold through the close leafage
behind them, while the mosquitoes were coming out in detachments. But
when did lovers ever care about dinner? In a few more moments the
village women would be coming here to fetch water; already their
chattering was borne, like the clatter of cockatoos on the wing, upon
the evening winds. The gardens spread behind the umbrageous
balustrades like long shady avenues, where these tawny insect-crowded
shafts of sunlight were stretching down like golden ropes. Neither
Kamo nor Rea had any desire to be seen in their moment of
reconciliation or be twitted about their quarrel, so they turned in
time into the thicket, as the first company of girls appeared from
the village pathway with their water--pots upon their shoulders.</p>

<p>Round the well there was an open space, grass-covered, where the
girls lingered to chaff one another, as girls do, or listen to the
experiences of the old women. Here, also, the boys wandered about at
this hour, to impress the girls with their splendour; for there were
great dandies in Hula, who were in the habit of sporting all their
property in the form of ornaments, and who here strutted about
arm-in-arm, with their bushy heads adorned with flowers and feathers,
so that the girls might admire them as they passed.</p>

<p>It is curious how much alike human nature is all over the world,
and how youth must assert itself in the spring-time, either with nose
ornaments or stiff high collars, just as the young tree puts on its
blossom.</p>

<p>It was all the same here in Hula under the down-hanging fronds of
the palm-trees as in the streets of London on a summer night, or on a
village green in the country, where the maidens and young men
foregather under the unlighted lamp-posts or the old oak
branches.</p>

<p>The same as will happen in Iceland during the short fierce summer,
or on the banks of the Ganges--the same that took place on the banks
of the Nile or the canals of Assyria four thousand years ago, and
will go on while the world rolls round the sun.</p>

<p>Rea had not been many moments amongst those shady avenues of
fruit-trees before she regretted the penance which she had imposed
upon Kamo. It was so nice to be out here all alone, away for a little
time from her father's watchful eye, although she knew that even now
he was hunting after them both; and kisses don't taste so nice before
an audience as they do when taken in shady places with no spectator.
She felt too the punishment would be hers as much as his, because she
would not have him near her to torment; as she meditated she watched
with delight his glorious form.</p>

<p>"I'll let you off to-night, Kamo, if you never do anything to
annoy me again."</p>

<p>Rea was very tender just now, with the twilight hush upon her; and
Kamo's arm, the one round her waist, trembled as he drew her closer
beside him and kissed her, which she did not try to stop. Over their
heads, between a rift in the papua-tree, the young moon basked upon
her back, on a velvet bed of orange-green, while all the garden was
steeped in the sombre shapelessness of a low-toned Flemish
study--tender and filled with mystery.</p>

<p>Rea's heart was beating down the walls of affectation and reserve,
for Kamo grew more her master than she felt she ought to let him be;
but it was too sweet to rest passive, and too much effort to resist
his caresses. And she had had enough of trouble in asserting her
rights already for one day, so for one short twilight hour she
permitted him and herself to be happy.</p>

<p>"Ha! so I have found you at last!" cried the deep tones of her
parent, as he laid a heavy hand on Kamo's shoulder; and the honeyed
dream for that time was over.</p>

<h3>Chapter XIII. Towards the Fly River.</h3>

<p>IT is not a very long run to the New Guinea coast when the wind is
fair, although in the Papuan Gulf very violent storms are apt to be
experienced. Niggeree, in his Sunflower, led the way, with the Coral
Seas keeping as nearly beside him as it was possible, and although
the weather was calm inside the reefs and as long as they were in the
Straits, there was a deal of tacking to be done to keep to the
course.</p>

<p>Still the wind was pretty fair, it being now nearly the middle of
the dry season, with an easterly monsoon blowing on their broadsides
as they made towards Kiwai, at the mouth of the Fly River.</p>

<p>A patchy sea, very treacherous as to bottom, right on to Bampton
Island, yet protected as far as Flinder's Entrance by the great
Barrier Reef, which made sailing comparatively easy by day,
particularly to so experienced a pilot as Niggeree, who knew every
inch of the way.</p>

<p>Niggeree would have liked Hector to have gone with him; but as he
had an extra crew of Malays and South Sea Islanders, old hands whom
the Greek could manage and trust, it was thought expedient that he
should accompany Captain Collins in his schooner, and follow as best
they could in the wake of the Sunflower.</p>

<p>So, after they parted from Joe and the Thunder, keeping well to
the wind, they sailed along smoothly; the sharp Sunflower, like a
fresh young filly, springing a mile or two in advance, to wait while
the other schooner, like a more sober old horse, tried to make
up.</p>

<p>Over a sea filled with ripples, all emerald and amethyst, with a
cloudless sky overhead, and a sun blazing down and making the pitch
in the seams bubble up and the iron and brass work feel almost red
hot.</p>

<p>Niggeree lay on the deck when not wanted, full in the fiery glare,
with bare legs and feet, with stalwart limbs brown as berries, his
pipe in his mouth. He was gazing upwards at the bulging sails and
cordage, while his Malay boy, who knew the waters almost as well as
his master, steered.</p>

<p>On the forecastle lay the Islanders, Malays, and Manilla boys, a
little crowd, too many to be required for such a small vessel; but
Niggeree knew his business well, and did not take a single man
without a purpose, and where he was going he knew well he would
require them all.</p>

<p>Arms of all kinds lay scattered about the decks as the men had
left them to be polished up--Winchesters and double-barrelled rifles,
cutlasses, and revolvers. Beside Niggeree lay a belt with two of
Colt's latest improvements and a fifteen-chambered Winchester, while
in his left hand he lazily held a freshly-ground cutlass, the keen
edge of which he lightly touched with his right thumb, laying it down
to remove his pipe when he had to expectorate, which he did without
raising his head, and lifting it again with the dreamy tenderness
with which women are apt to finger a love relic.</p>

<p>At times he uttered, in a quiet, muffled tone, without removing
his pipe, an order which the Malay instantly caught and obeyed, and
once, without waiting to see where they were, he sprang, with the
agility of a sleeping cat suddenly roused up by a foot treading on
her tail, and, running up to the masthead, clung there for a few
moments with one arm and one foot round the bare pole, while he
motioned with his other hand the direction to the man at the
wheel.</p>

<p>They were passing over a green patch of water with only a ship and
a half's length of deep blue channel, all crooked and circuitous,
where the many-tinted fish could be seen darting about in myriads,
and as the sunbeams dived down amongst the cool transparency, lovely
shapes, like trees and flowers, could be seen springing up as if
carved from emerald, lapis lazuli, or amber, while in front of them
leapt and flew the shoals of flying-fish, and all round, like fairy
barges, floated the nautilus fleets steering due west.</p>

<p>A scene of light and soul-satisfying beauty and warmth, with that
strong yet soft breeze pressing upon the skin like eider-down and
tossing the locks aside with velvet flappings. Away in front and
east-ward the horizon was a tumbled line of intense blue, with broken
fringes of dazzling white; they were nearing the point where the
protecting barrier ceased entirely, and where the ocean boiled in
fury. There was a cloudless gale outside there, and no mistake--one
of those gales most dangerous to sailing craft, where the waves beat
up faster and stronger than the wind, giving the steersman hardly a
chance to evade the swamping mountains.</p>

<p>As yet it was all right with the calm sea, and the strong blast
filled to straining the shortened upper sail, and drove the mist
wreathes merrily out of the way.</p>

<p>"Furl sails!" cried Niggeree, coming down from his perch aloft.
"Let's know the depth; there ought to be a sand-bank hereabouts where
we can anchor."</p>

<p>Some of the men sprang up to the yard and stowed away the canvas
as the lead showed satisfactory anchorage, so in another moment the
Sunflower was riding safely amongst the coral, while her captain
waited upon his consort's approach.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Nig! what's up?" bawled out Collins from his deck when
they got within hail.</p>

<p>"Nothing, only it's too rough outside to go on; besides, we'll
lose nothing by this half-day at anchor. We can easily reach Mibu
to-morrow, while the wind may lull a bit to-night."</p>

<p>"It does look roughish outside," responded Collins. "Have you good
anchorage there, mate?"</p>

<p>"Only a sand-patch of a few yards. Try over by the lee of you,
there ought to be something there if it hasn't shifted since last
voyage."</p>

<p>Collins reefed his solitary spread of canvas, and, letting his
vessel drift in the direction Niggeree pointed, watched anxiously as
the man threw in the lead and sounded.</p>

<p>A sleepy Manilla man the sounder was, who threw out his line and
drew it in again hand over fist in a listless way, singing out in a
monotonous drone, as if it had been an old lesson the interest in
which he had long since lost.</p>

<p>"Five fathoms!"</p>

<p>"Four fathoms and a quarter!"</p>

<p>"Three fathoms less twain!"</p>

<p>"Two foot, sah!"</p>

<p>This last was jerked out in a surprised tone as the Manilla man
looked up suddenly, very wide awake indeed, to meet Hector's laughing
blue eyes fixed upon him. They were on the sand-bank safe enough, and
had been for the minute and a half while he had been throwing out his
line.</p>

<p>"Low tide; you are all right. Drop the anchor, mate," cried the
Greek, who had been quietly watching this mishap, knowing well how it
would happen.</p>

<p>Collins gave a grunt of relief, and next moment the anchor-chain
was rattling through the hawse-hole.</p>

<p>The atmosphere, very clear here, enabled them to see a long way
around them. Far away to the northeast they could trace, like a faint
stain upon that grey-white lower space, a lofty range of mountains
with abrupt summits and edges, like sheets of blotting-paper with the
edges frayed and torn, the faint outlines of distant New Guinea.</p>

<p>Nearer at hand and all round were numberless islands, some high,
rising with rocky sides, others low and mango-covered. On one small
island, about two miles off, they saw a long row of pelicans standing
seemingly motionless in the afternoon sun, snow-white against the
yellow sand lustre, with scraggy bushes here and there. Behind this
patch of sand (the formation of a future island) the larger and older
island lay, with a line of smooth water between. A palm-grove waved
above the mangroves' outer rim; but, beyond the flocks of sea and
land-birds fluttering about, there was no sign of other life.</p>

<p>"Did you shoot the whole tribe, Nig?" asked Captain Collins,
pointing over to the palms.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," replied the Greek from his deck--there was only about
fifty yards between the vessels, so that in that rarefied air they
did not require to raise their voices. "I left my young woman with
her old father and mother, to keep her company when I was away. I'm
going ashore as soon as we have some grub."</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" inquired Hector.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, they were always sulky with me ever since I shot
her brother, and never got enough copra ready, so that I knew that
they were only waiting a chance to do for me if they could. I had
burnt down the village twice, and roasted two or three of the kids
left sleeping, but it was no use; I could see every time I came that
they meant to do it, but were afeared of my Winchester.</p>

<p>"Well, one night my gal comes to me, and says she, 'Sleep on board
to--night, Niggeree.' I axes her 'Why;' so she says, 'Nothing, only
the mosquitoes are bad.' I knew that she was telling lies, for you
never yet see a native cared a brass button about mosquitoes; you
see, she knew the plot, and that her brothers were in it, and didn't
want me to be hurt or them either, so I didn't press her just then,
but took her straight away on board.</p>

<p>"When we got out of the house, I could see two or three black
figures popping about; however, I took no notice of them, but pulled
straight on.</p>

<p>"When I gets her into my cabin, I took her square by both
shoulders, and says I, 'Now, my gal, what is it? Out with the whole
yarn, or I'll blow your head to pieces;' and with that I clapped
against her head the barrel of my Colt. Then she drops on her knees,
and tells me all about it, asking me not to kill her own relations,
which, of course, I promises, so as to hear the whole yarn. They had
got her to join them, and steal my firearms, and all she could lay
her hands on of the 'munition; but at the last she had repented. I
was to be killed that night in her father's house, but now they would
know that game was up.</p>

<p>"'What did they take the guns for?' I asked, for I knew they
couldn't use them.</p>

<p>"'So that your men might not be able to help you. They mean to
board her to-night, and murder them, after they are done with you,
and take the ship.'</p>

<p>"'Where are the guns?'</p>

<p>"'I hid them on the west side of the island.'</p>

<p>"'Do they know about where they are?'</p>

<p>"'No; I did it all by myself.'</p>

<p>"'Well, wench, I won't punish you this time, so let's get to
bed.'</p>

<p>"I thought there was no good frightening the boys, and there was
lots of time before us, so I turned in to get an hour's sleep, she
tumbling and tossing about, with now and then a sob, waking me up
just when I was going off, or, maybe, it would be her hot arms
getting about me, at which I'd give a cuss or two, and fling her off,
with a pretty tough smack.</p>

<p>"I must have gone over asleep at last, for I was just in the
middle of a nice cheery dream, in which I had got the whole batch of
them safely over to Maryborough, and the tin in my pocket, without
any questions axed, when I felt her hand on my mouth, and her voice
in my ear,--</p>

<p>"'Wake, Niggeree! they are coming off!'</p>

<p>"I gets up to listen, and there, sure enough, they were pushing
off the canoes from the shore.</p>

<p>"'Come with me,' I whispered to her, and she followed.</p>

<p>"Then I goes on deck, and telling the boys to keep a sharp
look-out, I quietly drops over the offside, the gal following after
me, and strikes out for the point furthest from where the canoes were
pushing out; the night being pitch dark, I know'd there was no chance
of them seeing me, and we both took jolly good care that they didn't
hear us.</p>

<p>"Of course there were lots of sharks about, but we had no time to
think about them at that time; all I wanted was my Winchester and
some rounds.</p>

<p>"Well, we reached the point all right, and, creeping softly
through the woods, got to the plant, and I only takes what I think
would suit my purpose, and back we goes to the shore.</p>

<p>"I had a little dingey lying in a cove in case I might want it,
which no one knew about except myself; so we gets into it, the wench
sitting like a mouse, holding the guns and cartridges so as to keep
them dry.</p>

<p>"I pulled very gently to the side I had started from, and, making
the dingey fast to the anchor-chain, I got up that way, she handing
up the articles when I was safe up.</p>

<p>"'Sit where you are,' I whispered soft-like, 'and don't move,
whatever you hear.'</p>

<p>"Then I creeps along the deck, till I sees them all very busy at
the hatch, unloading my cargo, and handing it down to the other
niggers in the canoes; four of my boys I could see, faint like, lying
on the deck with their skulls battered in, while up aloft I saw some
figures squatting on the yard, and watching the work a-going on. I
thought they might be the other boys who had got off, as they sat
astride the yard like as if they were used to it, so I made up my
mind what to do.</p>

<p>"They were all so busy hauling away at the cargo, and chattering
in the dark, that they did not notice me till I planked myself down
beside them, with my back against the mast, and my feet dangling down
the hold, my cutlass laid over my knees, and my Winchester
careless-like slung across my left arm; but when they did spot me,
they jumps double-quick time back in a crowd, and stood gaping on me
as if they had seen a ghost.</p>

<p>"'Will we toot, master?' whispered one of my boys from aloft. Then
I knew that the wench hadn't taken all the guns, and I felt
comfortable.</p>

<p>"'Not just yet; cover them, boys, and wait till I give you the
word,' says I, keeping the trail of my eyes all round, to see that
none of them got behind me.</p>

<p>"'Well, of all the cussidest bits of cheek, this beats hollow.
What were you a-doing down my hold?' says I, sternly looking them all
round. I could see them plain enough now, for the sky behind me had
begun to lighten, and I knew the old moon was a-going to rise.</p>

<p>"For a while they stood staring, and saying nothing, then
by-and-by they plucks up courage, and begins all a jawing together,
and a moving nearer, with their clubs up and ready for action.</p>

<p>"'Keep back if ye don't want a bullet in your throats,' says I,
and then they sees I had my gun, and back they all goes a second
time.</p>

<p>"'Now,' says I, 'just you put every bag back again, and as quick
as you can.' They started to haul up the things from the canoes and
drop them down the hold as if they had never meant no harm.</p>

<p>"They got three or four bags back and into their places again,
when all of a sudden one of my gal's brothers says something, and
they pitched down the loads, and makes a rush.</p>

<p>"I was just a waiting for this, and without budging a step, or
moving my Winchester, I says, 'Oh, you will have it then!'
and--crack! crack!!--the brother and one behind him fell dead on the
deck right in front of the others, who fell over the bodies, and
rolled about in all directions, some going head over heels down the
hold.</p>

<p>"Then the fun began; I'm a pretty safe shot, as you know, but like
to save cartridges when I can. Up I jumps, all of a sudden, with my
cutlass cutting off a head wherever I saw one, and shouting, 'Come
down, boys, and let them have it.'</p>

<p>"It was a busy few minutes after that, for they kept swarming up
the sides to help their friends, now lying bleeding like a lot of
stuck pigs. My blood was up, and I let them have it; sometimes a
shot, or a slash with the cutlass, or a man's brains splashing across
my face, as I land him one with the butt end of my gun.</p>

<p>"My boys came down the rigging and joined in cheerily, for these
Malays like blood when they once begin, and when there's not much
danger about having it, and I bet you they got a treat that night,
and so did the sharks when we pitched the carcases overboard next
morning; but that was after we got back.</p>

<p>"As soon as the deck was cleared, we got into the boat and tore
like devils through the water; I felt drunk, and almost blind, too,
with the blood and brains in my eyes.</p>

<p>"Up and down the village we ran, firing the houses, so as to give
us more light to do our work, and the moon being now full up though
thin--like and worn to half its size, they hadn't a chance to get
away. Besides, until we were amongst them, they thought their friends
must have won, and were holding a grand corroberrie.</p>

<p>"Whenever I saw a nigger--man, woman or kid--I put it to death.
Some of the kids we took up, not being worth a cut, and pitched them
into the fires, where they roasted, screeching like wild cats.</p>

<p>"A rare old time, I tell you, mates, that was, with the flames
bursting out on all sides, and as hot as hell, while the moon turned
thinner as the sky got lighter. It was coming on to daylight before I
stopped, with a throat as dry as a cinder, and my pants sticking to
my legs with the red glue. There wasn't a white spot on me, for I
never stopped while one nigger lived on the island.</p>

<p>"The boys, too, were fagged out, and as we knew no one could leave
the island, we thought it best to knock off till daylight, when we
could go round and finish off any who might be left, or had run into
the woods.</p>

<p>"All this time I had forgotton about the wench, and only minded
about her when I got to the ship.</p>

<p>"Down we all staggered, scarce able to move a leg or arm, and
pulled slowly back to the Merry Mermaid, that was the schooner I
owned, that one the Queensland Government confiscated afore I was
naturalized.</p>

<p>"As we came near to the bows, I saw the dingey wasn't there, so
concluded she must have rowed after me, and got killed with the
rest.</p>

<p>"'Serve her right for her cussed obstinacy,' says I, as I poured
myself out a stiff pannikin of rum, passing the bottle over to the
lads to help themselves.</p>

<p>"After that I lay down on the deck in a clean place--there warn't
many clean spots on it--and tried to get a sleep while the boys were
pitching the dead niggers overboard.</p>

<p>"Yet, although I was most dead beat, I couldn't manage to close my
eyes, but kept looking up at the stars, as they popped out, one by
one, like burnt-out candles afore the light which was getting
stronger every minute.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was the dead bodies as they plunged with a loud
splash, one after the other, that set me a thinking on the gal. I'm
mostly tender--hearted where women are concerned, and I thought she
warn't a bad sort, taking natives all through, and must ha' liked me
a bit, or I'd be food for the fishes by that time, so that I began to
feel sorry that she hadn't stopped in the dingey that night.</p>

<p>"Things came up that had been between us two, and I missed her
badly just then, for I'd have liked another glass of grog, and some
one to fill my pipe, being too lazy-like to do it myself, and she was
always handy and willing at that sort of thing.</p>

<p>"Then I minded the day I gave her such a welt across the back with
the flat of my cutlass, that the mark never left her, or ever will,
as long as she lives; when she fell down on the sands and lay for
dead, nearly half a day, all for stealing a bit o' baccy out of my
tin case, which, as it happened, I found afterwards in my own pocket,
having put it there myself, after taking a quid, and some one
interrupting at the time. She always had a bad cough after that welt,
but she said nothing about it, and, of course, I didn't ever tell her
of my mistake, for it don't do to let them think the white fellow can
do any wrong; it would make them too conceited.</p>

<p>"Of course I felt perfectly easy in my mind as regards the
Government, for there was no one left to tell them about it, and my
boys wouldn't blab, being as deep in the mud as I was myself;
besides, I wasn't then a British subject.</p>

<p>"'Curse her obstinacy,' at last says I to myself, getting up, and
going to the locker where I kept the rum, and then cutting myself a
fill of baccy. I drank out of the bottle, for I was too tired to
fetch a pannikin, and I didn't want the boys to get any more.</p>

<p>"After taking a good long swig. I feels some better, and lighting
my pipe, goes over to see how they were getting along.</p>

<p>"They had chucked all the bodies over, and I could see the bay
swarming with black fins, tugging and tearing away at the carcases.
None of them had been allowed to sink to the bottom, for I could see
three or four fighting over one body, while they tore off long strips
from the ribs and bones, and shaking themselves in their hurry to
bolt it, and be back again before the others got too much of their
meal, while more came up and snapped at it, bringing it with a jerk
up half out of the water, so that I could see the bones washed with
the salt water, and looking as white as the shark's bellies; every
moment white ribs and leg-bones with crimson ribbons fluttering from
them turned to the surface.</p>

<p>"A large fellow now and then snatched a whole body from the teeth
of the smaller fry and made off with it, shaking it about as a
mastiff dog might do with a terrier when he was in a bad temper. I
thought on my swim ashore during the night, and felt disgusted at the
cruelty of dumb beasts; a kind of a cold disgust as made me shiver
and half feel their sharp teeth at my own backbone.</p>

<p>"My men had got all the cargo back into the hold again, and were
mopping down the decks from the mess we had made, all the excitement
gone out of them, and working away like lambs. They drew up buckets
of water, all kinds of pinky colours, from the sea which the sharks
were staining, and flung it over the decks, scrubbing along with
their mops, and squeegeeing it out of the scuppers. It took a deal of
slunging and mopping to get the dried clots rubbed out, or the
crusted brains scraped off. They got down on their knees amongst it
when they came to the dry bits, and scraped with their jack-knives,
while the water ran down the ship's sides almost thick.</p>

<p>"It was a misty morning, and the sun didn't show up till pretty
late that day, but the sky was warm-coloured and blushing-like, and
as the sea was a dead calm, with only the ground-swell--as always is
of a morning--that reddish colour in the sky got casting down darker
on the smooth water and bulging towards us, as if the whole ocean was
crowded with sharktorn dead bodies all gushing with blood.</p>

<p>"We were in shallow water--about five fathoms--where, on other
mornings, you could see the fishes playing about, and the coral, as
it is here, at most times; but as I looked over the sides I could see
nothing but crimson colour right down, and no bottom.</p>

<p>"I took off my pants, as I always do of a morning, to have a
slunge along with the deck, which I needed as much as I ever did; but
when the boys drew in the bucket and I saw how red the water was in
it, I told them to stash it, and went aft for a fresh pair of pants,
letting the blood stop about me as it was, although it was main
claggy.</p>

<p>"Well, after my smoke we had some breakfast. My Chinaman then had
hid himself at the back of his stove, and never came out till they
dropped across him when they were washing, and he was in such a state
of fear that he put salt in the tea instead of sugar; and then, after
a spell, we went ashore.</p>

<p>"It warn't much of a sight, the village that morning, with the
smoke still rising from the white ashes, and here and there a bit of
a post smouldering away or a leg or breast half roasted where they
had fallen, and still lay steaming, with the smell about the air
something between a butcher's killing-yard and a hotel kitchen. Some
of the palm-trunks were blackened on the side next to where the
houses had been, and the bananas were all shrivelled up--that is, all
those near enough--while at every step you either tripped over the
headless body of a woman or a man, or else sent some round head
rolling like a ball amongst the ashes or between a pair of dead
legs.</p>

<p>"My bare feet also would go squash into a pool of blood kept from
sinking through the sand by the steeped grass petticoat of some young
woman. It was nasty to feel those wet grasses getting between your
big and little toes, and clutching at your ankles like snakes; but I
turned over the young ones, where they had heads left on them, to see
if my gal was amongst them. The young ones mostly fell on their faces
when they were shot, and the old ones on their backs; kids fall about
anyhow.</p>

<p>"Well, we went the round, and I did not see her anywhere, neither
her father or mother. I was mighty easy in my mind at this, for I
knew then that she had got them safe away, and was hiding about the
bush somewhere. So we started on the hunt straight away.</p>

<p>"First I came upon the dingey in the cove where we had landed the
night before together, and then I felt sure that I'd find her near
the plant, for she was not very fly, but something like a wild beast
that runs always to the same hole. So telling my boys to beat about
the other parts, I started by myself to find her and her old
'uns.</p>

<p>"It felt calm-like and holy, walking through the woods in the
early morning, now I was content in my mind that she was still alive,
and having got away from the red sea and that burnt-down village. The
leaves, all wet, brushing my face, felt cool and nice, and I lay down
once or twice to have a roll on the wet grass, leaving the place I
rolled on when I rose all crushed down and red.</p>

<p>"At last I came upon them sitting--the two old ones dazed-like,
and doing nothing--on the wet grass. They were all whitish, like the
grass, and covered with dew. Most like they had sat there quiet all
night; I think so, for a bush-spider had finished his net-like web,
and had gone in to watch, either amongst the old man's wool, where
one end of the web was fastened to, or into the bush at the other
side of the footpath, over to where it stretched. The web was all
heavy and grey with the dew, like the old man's head, so he must have
sat still for hours.</p>

<p>"The old woman also looked straight along the road, and never
budged, although she must have seen me coming, looking like an old
idiot, with dead-lights for eyes. She has always gone about stupid
since.</p>

<p>"The wench lay all of a heap at her mother's feet, with her back
to me, and the broad welt from the cutlass raised out and whitish
against the dark skin. I couldn't make out where her legs, arms or
head had got to.</p>

<p>"'Hallo!' says I, funny like, giving her a bit of a kick behind,
'so you're not dead yet?'"</p>

<p>"She gathered herself up very quiet and reluctantly, with eyes all
on the stare, and when she saw it was me she kneeled down and kissed
my hand, all wet with the dew and bloody from holding the cutlass;
kissed it two or three times, so that when she lifted her mouth away
it looked as if it had got a blow and was bleeding.</p>

<p>"She's a very good gal, mates, so I made her queen of the desert
island, and if she wants another tribe to keep her company when I'm
away, why, then she'll have to begin and raise them."</p>

<h3>Chapter XIV. The Voyage of the "Thunder."</h3>

<p>THE next morning the Thunder left the island, after landing Joe,
who had by this time recovered his accustomed flow of spirits. A baby
after all to him was not so serious a loss as a firing of
b&ecirc;che-de-mer, and now that Queen Ine was off duty there was the
more need for him to exert himself.</p>

<p>He did not grudge the relations their time of lamentation, but
they must do it in relays; so before very long he was swaggering
about and blaspheming all round, according to his usual routine.</p>

<p>The baby had been buried during the night, thus that bother was
got over without trouble to him, and he kept out of Queen Ine's road
as much as convenient, and when he had to go indoors he moved as
quietly as he could, and swore as seldom as possible. So the mother
sat in the shadow or went into the lonely woods and there communed
with her own heart, while the unseen angels of God moved about her in
their own way, pouring balm upon this wounded heart.</p>

<p>Verily sorrow brings us very near to heaven, and dead fingers lie
gently on the soul.</p>

<p>It was about two days' journey to their island, and about twelve
hours' from the perfect Island of Darnley.</p>

<p>When Hafid felt the motion of the sea he seemed to rouse up, and
moved about the deck with a look of almost cheerful expectancy in his
eyes. The next land he would behold must be his own native land,
where on the mud-banks he would once more see his wife waiting on his
coming, the same as when he left her six years ago, the almond-eyed
girl he had courted amongst the tamarinds, with the lips of the
damask rose and the even teeth like rows of pearl. Over that dancing
plain, with the sunbeams laughing to him, and the eastern breeze
singing in his ears.</p>

<p>Mr. Bowman was a kind-hearted man, if a keen trader in his
employer's interest, and felt as he looked at Hafid much exercised in
his mind what to do with his charge. "However," he thought, "I may be
able to leave him with the missionary at Murray Island, who will have
a chance of sending him back, or failing that, I'll take him back to
Thursday Island and send him in one of the British India packets
going south." So he contented himself with that reflection, and went
below to the cabin to look with the captain over their charts.</p>

<p>So the day went past, they steaming gently along that tropic
ocean, with a sharp look-out for any patches on the way, and by
afternoon the lovely-shaped island rose slowly on the horizon,
growing from blue haze to purple, and at last taking on the delicious
local colours and shapes. Nearer, and native houses came into focus
with the palm-groves behind, then the natives were to be seen
clustering along the beach and wading about the waters; the point
where the mission-house stood boldly against the sky on the edge of
the hill, with the upward green slope about it, has an air of
infinite peace and rest.</p>

<p>Two boats put off at the same time to welcome them, one with the
sails up, running before the wind, belonging to the trader who came
to traffic, and the other being steered by the large-bodied,
gentle-faced South Sea Island teacher, while four stalwart natives
rowed him.</p>

<p>There being no other white resident here except the trader, who
was not very particular about dress, Bowman and Danby received them
in their airy costume of pajamas.</p>

<p>Hafid with glowing eyes saw the land loom up, then, as the
outlines became more defined, the expectant light died out, and a
hopeless disappointment dulled the amber, and crept like grey ashes
over his delicate features; once again he had been deceived by the
white man, for he had no sense of time or space. The dream was over,
and for ever; he could wait no longer, so he crawled away to a corner
between the boat and the bulwarks at the forecastle, and laid himself
down with a gentle sigh.</p>

<p>He shared with Orientals and Africans that curious faculty of
being able to die at will. When hope ceases to glow in their breasts,
or a superstitious omen tells them that they are to die, it may be
the word of the magician or the bone pointed at them, as amongst the
Queenslanders--or the lizard running over them, as with the Maori--or
the utter weariness of life taking possession, as with the Seedy
boys, they can lie down and give up life as easily and methodically
as they fall asleep.</p>

<p>Hafid had given up hope, trust in man was dead; the weariness of
death was upon him, so he turned his face to the bulwark, and waited
quietly on the coming of his fate.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was better to give up before going home, better to have
seen his sweetheart as he left her, and as he will always see her
throughout eternity; for those who die young, like the absent, grow
no older; the dark tresses never grow thin nor the baby lisp deep and
full, and as we live in memory here we must so be shaped
hereafter.</p>

<p>After business was arranged with the trader, Bowman, Danby, and
the captain went ashore with the missionary. Hans, the engineer, not
being invited, occupied himself, along with the Hibernian mate and
the little Cockney assistant, in abusing the whole crowd. Hans had a
fine contempt for any one who slighted him, or, rather, whom he
fancied did so.</p>

<p>They went in due form, and were introduced to the native king of
the island. All the islands have separate kings; there is an immense
quantity of royal blood in the Australian colonies, as well as a vast
stock of aristocracy; we meet them knocking about everywhere.</p>

<p>Next they visited the missionary house, a roomy bamboo structure
of two apartments, with the large yard behind, where the women cooked
and did their work, and having gardens around. Inside, the floor was
covered with grass matting, and was beautifully cool and clean. There
were no chairs, as the habit is to sit on the floor. The Europeans,
not being used to this, sat on the edge of the large bed, near where
a young woman lay, nearly wasted to a skeleton with the fever. Her
husband sat by her side and held her hand, which he stroked gently,
while he read in a low voice from his native testament. She had been
lovely at one time, and was still very young, not more than
seventeen, but her cheeks had fallen in and her lips were thin and
drawn from the white teeth, while her dark eyes looked too large for
the thin face, and her long black wavy hair hung down limply and was
streaked with grey.</p>

<p>On the ground two young girls sat holding a young infant, also
wasted and lifeless-looking--the baby of the fever-stricken and dying
girl on the bed.</p>

<p>A tall, comely woman moved lightly about breaking the young
cocoa--nuts, and filling the jugs with the milk, all they had to
offer the strangers; she was dressed in the usual falling robe of
spotted blue, which, as she moved about, showed her full proportions
and rounded limbs.</p>

<p>Bowman took out his flask to qualify the fluid she gracefully
offered them, and motioned to their guide if he would share, at which
he gently shook his head and smiled.</p>

<p>They had no medicine to give the sick girl, so they did what they
could to relieve her, read the words of consolation and prayed,
placing her future and their own in higher hands with child-like
trust.</p>

<p>One look round at this household was enough to convince one of
their sincerity and zeal for the cause in which they laboured and
without a murmur laid down their lives; abstemious, industrious, and
meek, they sacrificed themselves and all that they loved best, living
cheerfully in the land of their adoption, knowing that they would
never again return to their native homes.</p>

<p>No need to ask how they managed on the twenty pounds a-year; they
were now existing on the yams and taro, which they had cultivated,
without a taste of bread or animal food until their next allowance
came.</p>

<p>Sometimes when very hard up, they appealed to their own countrymen
in the Straits, those who were pearl-divers, and who made and spent
small fortunes by their dangerous calling, and they never appealed in
vain, these reckless sons of the South Seas, who made money
hand-over--fist, sending as much as forty pounds at a time to assist
their hard-up brothers labouring and starving in the Lord's vineyard;
but they never appealed to the mission station for more money, and
they never rebelled.</p>

<p>This poor teacher holds the hand of the woman he is losing, whom
he loves so dearly; yet both know that when she is dead he will have
short time for lamenting her loss, for according to his bond he must
choose another wife within six months. He is saying good-bye, and
hopes to meet her in heaven, along with the wife who has gone before
her, and the women who are to follow, unless he dies first. It is,
perhaps, as well that there is neither giving away nor marrying in
Heaven.</p>

<p>After a walk through the gardens and along the shore, they put off
and pull to the steamer, the missionary coming with them to get some
quinine for the sick girl, and bringing with him in return some
curios in the shape of spears and necklets.</p>

<p>The sun has just disappeared behind the ocean-line when they jump
on board, and the air is filled with the brown lustre, which falls
along the deck with a sickly glow, and hardly have they touched the
deck before the captain bustles about bullying and cursing all round
in mixed Scotch and colonial, to which the mate replies in choice
Irish; the coloured men sulk about in detached groups.</p>

<p>There are no ladies present, but that would make little difference
when Captain MacAndrews is flying round. A nautical order does not
sound like a command, unless it is well interlarded with adjectives,
at least it was so with the old school. Now we walk the decks of
steam-packets instead of sailing-vessels, and see officers attired in
drawing-room costume, addressing Lascars in chow-chow Hindoostanee,
while silent, white-clad, turbaned figures glide ghost-like about:
but on the Thunder, although the sailors were dark-skinned the blank
cartridges were not fired from air-guns, neither would the officers
have adorned a drawing--room, for they dressed as they spoke and
lived.</p>

<p>Danby laughed gently as the echoes wafted back the strong accents,
and said, "Keep your collar on, old man," to the skipper, as he
lurched past, at which remark MacAndrews, considering that he had
never yet been beheld by mortal man inside such an unnecessary
article of furniture, seemed on the verge of blasphemy, and Danby
merited the glare which that precise young gentleman received as
reply.</p>

<p>"Massa Bowman," said the steward, as he came up to the cabin door,
"Hafid going to die."</p>

<p>"What!" said Bowman, startled.</p>

<p>"Yes, he got the devil in him inside, all over sick."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Over there by the boat, very ill."</p>

<p>Bowman and Danby went over to where the Hindoo lay on his back,
where the men had found him, quiet and seemingly unconscious of all
about him.</p>

<p>"Bring him aft, and let's see what the matter is," said Bowman,
turning to the Malay, after touching Hafid with his foot, without,
however, getting any response from the prostrate figure.</p>

<p>But none of the coloured men moved to assist, indeed they gave
even Bowman a wide berth, as it was a conviction amongst them that he
was also doomed from having come in contact with the devil in
Hafid.</p>

<p>This will-power is utterly beyond the comprehension of us
Westerns, nor can doctors give the complaint a name, sailors say they
die out of "pure cussedness." A Maori will count up the days he has
to live, inform his friends of the fact, and die up to time; they
calmly lie down and die, without an effort. What a gift to be
possessed of by the miserable, but we are coarser in fibre, the life
holds firmer to its tenement in us barbarians, and so it requires the
pistol, knife, or strong poison to accomplish what the Eastern can do
without, seemingly, an effort.</p>

<p>Between Danby and Bowman, Hafid was dragged along the deck and
laid in a comfortable place under the awning. He made no motion, but
let them do as they liked with him, only turning his face from them
after he was laid down, and waiting, without a smile, on the coming
of the angel who carries the silver shears.</p>

<p>Was he dying of that trouble which we all scoff at now-a-days, or
only sulking out of pure cussedness?</p>

<h3>Chapter XV. The Storm.</h3>

<p>A STORM at sea, under a smiling sky, with sweltering decks, seems
as great an inconsistency as to see a married couple quarreling; that
is, the husband raving like a madman, and the wife looking her most
aggravating sweetest.</p>

<p>In the Bay of Biscay it is all in harmony--the slaty sky, driving
rain deluging the sheets and making the furious waves appear to smoke
as they rise and tumble in the distance steel grey, or break over the
decks bottle-green and flecked with foam like the froth driven from
the fangs of a mad dog.</p>

<p>We picture misty outlines, all blurred and broken, when the ocean
rises up in its wrath not to be driven along and pitched from side to
side under the flaming lustre of a tropic sun, which licks up the
brine as it recedes after each mad leap, and makes prismatic flashes
of the liquid drippings, while the mountains behind and around,
snow-crested, are mountains of emerald and sapphire, all shot with
molten gold.</p>

<p>Captain Collins and Hector clung to the wheel as the Coral Seas
staggered along and shook amongst those tumbling furies.</p>

<p>They were alone on that raging ocean, for the wind had not
lessened, and when they dashed together out from the protection of
the reefs, no man could attempt to curb the schooners or keep them
together. The Sunflower went out of sight ahead like an express
train, dropping behind the horizon as if she had suddenly swamped,
and leaving her consort to follow as she best could.</p>

<p>They had agreed to meet, if possible, at Uibu, where they would
once more find shelter and smooth waters inside the Fly River,
Niggeree giving full directions, and leaving behind him a chart of
his own making, where all the dangers were marked out, before he
started.</p>

<p>That night he had gone alone to the island. Somehow his little
yarn inspired neither Collins nor Hector with any desire to see more
closely the scene of that tragedy or the survivors, and they asked no
questions about them when he returned the next morning.</p>

<p>At present both men have enough to do, for, with that furious hot
gale trying to push them westward and their united efforts to keep
her head towards the north, all their strength was required to manage
the wheel and keep their feet.</p>

<p>The men clung to whatever they could cling to, all loose articles
being firmly lashed before starting; they had nothing to do except
wait and battle for life with the sea.</p>

<p>Every moment the green sparkling waves broke over them with a
shriek like horrid laughter, and the light little vessel heeled over
before that overwhelming strength until the bare yard touched the
rising waves on the lee side, hardly having time to right herself
before the next swamping mass came down upon her.</p>

<p>But she was light, and water-tight, and the crew being well
accustomed to the Papuan waters, although never before so far west,
did not suffer much uneasiness. So long as the vessel obeyed the helm
and the wheel did not break, all they concerned themselves about was
to ease her off as much as they could while keeping their course.</p>

<p>Now and again they saw ahead portions of the waters where it
seemed quieter, but on the east side of these quiet places the foam
rose up like straight walls, and these places they tried to keep
clear of; but as long as the waves rose and fell steadily they felt
easy.</p>

<p>Inside some of these pool-like places they saw little islands,
some bare strips of yellow sand surrounded by deep blue spaces, with
pelicans and other sea-birds backing against the wind or rising with
ungainly motion and flapping wings, as if protesting against the
unusual commotion which disturbed their mid-day siesta.</p>

<p>On other and larger islands they saw the first approach to
fertilization in the shape of scrubby trees and distorted
wind-beaten-down branches; yet even there were the strips of golden
sunny sands and smooth girdle of blue waters surrounded with that
straight, up-spouting wall of snowy foam which fringed the tumbling
mountains outside--golden sands and smooth waters where elves might
have disported themselves or mermaids might have waited on the coming
of the ships, only that orthodox mermaids like the storm-beaten rocks
of the North Sea, as elves and fairies like the gas-lit pavements of
large cities--this is the condition of Titania's court in this
unimaginative nineteenth century.</p>

<p>It was getting on towards night, and still the waves broke as
wildly as ever, and not a sign of the Sunflower or of the wind
slackening down. The night they dreaded most, for there was no moon,
and unless they found an anchorage soon they would have to drive
about all in the dark, and take their chance of reefs and
shipwreck.</p>

<p>Eagerly they looked ahead, seeing many coral-walled lakes, but
without a break in their white walls, and they knew well what an
approach to these meant.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the sun went down all yellow, crimson, and violet,
making golden seams run down the sides of those blue waves, like
melted metal running out of a half-closed furnace; and when the
vessel rose on the crest of a wave, all dripping wet, that metal
lustre seemed to bronze over the hull and decks with sharp edges of
burnish. Then the twilight spread beyond those solid-looking gigantic
masses which appeared when they rolled into the trough of the waves
like iron ridges against a lighted-up transparent tinted screen. Then
the darkness grew like an opaque green curtain behind a black and
rumpled pall. During the night, countless stars glittered like angry
eyes within a deep pit. The brave sailors held on, with drooping lids
and wearied arms, ever staring ahead and trying to evade those awful
walls, now tarnished silver in the blackness, where the howling
became horrible shrieks, while around them blazed phosphorescent
lights as the waves hissed past them or broke over them emitting
flashes and sparkles like unholy corpse-candles.</p>

<h3>Chapter XVI. Driven Ashore.</h3>

<p>MORNING came at last, and Collins and Hector were freed from all
anxiety, in the sense that the condemned criminal feels relieved
after the judge has pronounced his sentence. Their steering-gear had
snapped just as the darkness melted away, and they were now pitching
and rolling due west, without the power to alter their course or
avoid reefs which might come in their way.</p>

<p>No boat could live on that sea, so that they had just to take
their chance of whatever mishap was in the near future.</p>

<p>At present the ocean seemed clear, and presented only a tumbling
waste, so now the pair sat sucking away at their saturated pipes, and
hanging on to the sides while they lay on the deck and waited.</p>

<p>"Whereabouts do you think we are?" observed Hector, quietly.</p>

<p>"God only knows," responded Collins. "I take it we were near on to
Bristow Island when the gear gave way, and now are drifting on to
Sabai or the Baxter River; but we'll very soon find out."</p>

<p>The schooner was full before the wind now, going at a furious
rate, and so they relapsed into silence, dropping asleep now and
then, to be roused up by another sweeping wave, when, after they had
cleared the brine out of their eyes, they'd look ahead, and then
settle down again to sleep.</p>

<p>The men forward still clung, as they had done all night, and
looked towards their masters with apathetic faces.</p>

<p>"Land ahead at last!" suddenly cried Collins, getting up and
staring out. "The mainland, or I'm much mistaken."</p>

<p>Yes, there it was, like a low bank of clouds, very flat, and
spreading out in front of them; nearer, and they can see the yellow
sands with a fringe of white beating against it, and between them and
it, in detached places, patches of reef with wide openings
between.</p>

<p>"Like as not we shall strike against one of these patches and go
to pieces; let's have the boat ready."</p>

<p>The sea was not quite so wild now, and since the vessel had been
left to herself the waves broke less frequently over her; she went
with the waves and the wind, and rode lighter over the crests, so
that they were able to get the dingey ready.</p>

<p>"It's no use, you know, if we strike a patch, but it's our only
chance." And they all got up and stood beside the boat ready to
spring in if she struck, but they did not loosen the lashings, but
waited with knives drawn ready to cut.</p>

<p>The coast was level as far as they could see it, with a
thickly-wooded country behind, but no sign of natives.</p>

<p>"A near shave that time," cried Collins, as they darted into one
of the openings only a few feet distant from the reef, where the
waters beat against it with a thunderous fury. "I think we are pretty
safe now, for the rest of the way seems to be sand."</p>

<p>The waves were much quieter inside this partial barrier, and so
mixed up with mud and sand that they could not see the bottom or what
they were passing over.</p>

<p>"We'll get ashore yet, mate," again cried out Collins, his piping
voice almost cheery. "Heave out the line and let's see the depth, and
be ready, boys, with the anchor."</p>

<p>A heave or two showed them they were getting into shallow waters
with a good mud bottom, and soon they were near enough to drop the
anchor, which, after dragging a few yards, caught fast, and brought
them to with a jerk. So far, they were in comparative safety,
although far from being comfortable, and could look about them.</p>

<p>The coast appeared completely deserted, for not a native village
could be seen, while from where they lay a broad river of nearly a
mile wide could be seen emptying itself into the sea, all muddy
coloured; the banks of the river were lined with mangrove bushes and
low mud banks.</p>

<p>"That ought to be the Baxter River from its appearance," remarked
Collins. "If so, we'll tow her into it as soon as the sea settles
down, and strike overland and make for the Fly; if Nig has got right,
we'll find him somewhere there."</p>

<p>"Our only plan now, while this monsoon lasts; so meantime let's
have something to eat and drink."</p>

<p>The storm had spent itself, as they could see, and although still
raging away outside, it was growing quieter every moment at their
anchorage, so, after making the best breakfast they could, they got
the dingey over the side, and, taking their revolvers and rifles with
them, rowed into the river, where shortly they discovered a pretty
safe landing-place, and making their boat fast to one of the
branches, they waded through the soft slime to the firm grass
beyond.</p>

<p>"A splendid lair for alligators," observed Hector, as they stood
on firm ground once more.</p>

<p>"First-rate! but I'm much more concerned about natives; let's get
along cautiously and see if there are any about."</p>

<p>The sun was now full up, and they could see the vessel tugging
away at her anchor chain and the two boys they had left in charge
squatting upon the deck cleaning and drying their guns, but no signs
of either house or canoe anywhere.</p>

<p>Out to sea the billows still rose and fell in irregular dark
masses, with the white splashes which marked a hidden reef, but the
wind felt softer as it struck against their cheeks. Yes, decidedly,
the storm was over, and by mid-day they would be able to tow their
little schooner into the calm shelter of the river.</p>

<h3>Chapter XVII. Rea's Troubles Begin.</h3>

<p>TOTO was a comic rogue when he liked to set himself out to amuse
people; his large loose mouth gave him a soft appearance, while he
could make faces which convulsed the on-lookers; no merry gathering
or feast was considered complete without this witty one.</p>

<p>A coward, ah, yes! they all allowed that, but then he made no
pretensions to be a hero; he could sing hymns so that they sounded
like comic songs, and mimic the missionary to perfection, and tell
lies by the yard, but then his were comic lies, and no one ever took
offence at his jokes, because people don't like to hit those
professors of peace who will not strike back again, and Toto seldom
jested unless he knew his man.</p>

<p>He passed in Hula amongst husbands and fathers for an
easy-tempered wealthy fool who could not do much harm, and he knew
too much about the daughters and wives of some, for them to betray
his real character, while at the same time he was by nature discreet
where they had entrusted their secrets to him. In New Guinea his
profession was unknown; indeed, he was there the originator of his
calling, and the natives of Hula were the last to hear how their
village was talked of in other parts of the land, just as a husband
is ofttimes the latest to hear that which the world is constantly
whispering about.</p>

<p>Toto was the very last one to boast about what would have cost him
his head.</p>

<p>Since the father of Rea laid his hand on her lover's shoulder in
the gardens of Hula, and parted the pair, there had come a change
over the spirit of their dreams.</p>

<p>Toto's wealth had long attracted the attention of the father, who
wished for nothing so much as to break his engagement with Kamo and
take on with the more eligible suitor, yet hitherto he had not dared
to interfere with the choice of the maiden, but now that unlucky Kamo
had given him the opportunity, he determined to improve upon it, so
that while the fond pair were making up their differences under the
cocoa-nuts, the stern parent had been holding a consultation with the
elders of the tribe, Toto assisting with his sage advice. The result
was that the youth was condemned for having affronted the dignity of
his chief in the person of his daughter, and the sentence passed that
the engagement should come to an end, and parental authority he
brought to bear upon the inclination of the maiden if she did not
herself see the necessity of asserting her own dignity.</p>

<p>Kamo that night slept in the woods after all, while Rea lay in the
house of her father, a tearful prisoner, and alone.</p>

<p>To-night there is to be a feast and a ghost entertainment, for the
spirit--men have come into the village, to tell fortunes and to
prophecy.</p>

<p>The spirit-men are the guests of good-natured Toto.</p>

<p>This is one of his good qualities; he is very hospitable, and ever
ready to place his two-roomed house at the disposal of strangers. All
day long the preparations went on, and Toto bustled about getting
masks and things ready, while the villagers kept away from the
vicinity of the wizards with great awe, and waited on the night with
trembling expectancy.</p>

<p>Kamo went about disconsolate, only able to get a look and wan
smile from Rea, as she peeped out from under the matting of her
father's house. He could only wave his hand in return and pass by,
for her father sat in silent, stern state by the foot of the ladder
and looked on the young man as if he had been a stranger.</p>

<p>Kamo, having been with the white men, did not place much faith in
the predictions of these spirit-teachers or devil-men, but he
appreciated the power they possessed, and knew quite well that the
result of to-night's predictions would be another bar in his way; he
felt convinced that the friends of Toto were not likely to predict
anything favourable to his love, and he also surmised that it was by
Toto's arranging that the show had been got up.</p>

<p>Nevertheless youth is hopeful, and the present ever better than
future benefits; he felt sure that in the bustle of the crowd and in
the darkness he might have a chance of whispering a word in Rea's
ear, and that was enough to comfort him.</p>

<p>A balmy night towards the close of the dry season! In another week
the wind would shift, and the lakatois with their merchandise might
be expected home; most of the men had gone west to Moresby, and other
places along the coast, so that the population at present consisted
principally of women, old men, and boys. Kamo's projected marriage
had interfered with his taking part in the expedition, and now he
wanders over the sands watching the people as they gather round the
fires, placed in front of Toto's house, all anxiously waiting on the
opening of the door.</p>

<p>They were, or pretended to be, very much afraid of these
devil-men, and although they knew the hideous masks were made of wood
and paint, yet the spirits behind transformed the wooden stocks into
real monsters for the time.</p>

<p>These natives have no mode or ceremony of religious observances,
they believe in a good spirit and a malignant one. The good spirit
makes the world fair, and the flowers and fruit to grow, and does
good because he cannot do evil. It is only the evil spirit who, by
reason of his imperfections, can be moved by prayers and flattery, as
a bad man, a tyrant, likes fawning slaves; so they administer to the
vanity of the Evil one that he may forego his wicked intentions. They
honour the Good by the silence of unuttered respect.</p>

<p>The new moon shines upon the bay with a subdued radiance, for over
her silver horn the filmy mists which betoken a change of weather are
gathered; this thin veil the rays scatter, till the whole scene is
penetrated by the tender illumination. The houses in the water are
ghost-like and seem to hang in the air, the vapours lying heaviest
around the posts.</p>

<p>Through the trees Kamo gets crimson and golden glimpses of the
fires, with the dark figures moving about and mixing at times with
the slender columns of the palms, while long shafts of dim,
dust-colour spread from those bright splashes to the sands and water;
a glitter of gold is on the over-turned side of the advancing
wavelet, where the dust-tinted shafts fall, or a shade of deep red on
the tawny limbs of some naked savage, as he stalked across these
light gateways, and for an instant blocked them up; while up the
tree-trunks and along the branches or drooping fronds run and drip
worsted-like threads of vermilion.</p>

<p>They are now beating on their iguana skin drums and sounding their
pan-reeds and shell-rattles, so Kamo moves nearer to the crowd, for
he knows the show is about to begin.</p>

<p>As he glides behind the trees and takes his observations before
advancing, the door opens and the dread priests of the devil make
their weird appearance, led on by the large open-mouthed Toto, who
takes the part of the comic muse, or clown, dressed with a female
petticoat round his waist and his gaytinted trousers underneath, and
making uncouth, and I fear to add, rather obscene gestures as he
marches in front.</p>

<p>They laugh at Toto, but gaze with fearful expectancy behind him
into the shadow of the doorway from which he has emerged, and where
now slowly comes a strange diabolical figure with glassy eyes, which
catch the red glitter from the flame, and appear to glare with fury
upon that assembled crowd.</p>

<p>Kamo sees where the father of Rea is placed amongst the elders of
the tribe, while the maiden he loves sits with downcast air on the
margin of the circle of young girls.</p>

<p>She has taken her seat very much in the background, so that she
sits in the shadow of the other's backs, while behind her grows a
thick undergrowth of shrubbery.</p>

<p>Kamo watches his opportunity, and on hands and knees creeps
through the long grasses till he gets near enough to her, then
putting out a brown arm, he touches her softly in the side,
whispering, "Rea."</p>

<p>None of the others hear him, and Rea does not appear startled, she
only allows his hand to drop down to her side, and with Kamo's grasp
murmuring, "Yes, Kamo!" and then they are both quiet and appear to
watch.</p>

<p>The first actor has come forth, and now stands in the full
fire-light, while Toto, feigning great fear, falls flat on his face
with his petticoat, as if by accident, over his head, but no one
laughs now at the comic fellow, they are watching, eyes and mouth
wide open, for what has to come.</p>

<p>The mask is like a monster beast on all fours, shaped something
like a gigantic alligator, with feathers and streamers of grasses
partly hiding the four feet.</p>

<p>While all eyes were fixed upon it some figures came out of the
hut, with false faces and strange dresses, dancing wildly and
spinning round the monster, singing a wild chaunt and beating upon
their drums. Then from the shadows behind, as if rising from the
earth, appeared all dim in the half-light, a great upright form of
about fifteen feet high, with a ghastly white face and holes for
eyes, which glowed crimson, while from the half-open mouth came puffs
of smoke and sparks; it was draped in a mat which fell to the ground
like a screen, and hid the performers, who were behind.</p>

<p>When this tall and horrible-looking spectre appeared, the drums
ceased their din, and a great silence fell over the crowd, for this
was the ghost which prophesied. A hollow rumbling sound first broke
upon the silence, suspiciously like two or three men groaning in
unison behind, at which the old men shuddered, while the women hid
their faces, and then the oracle spoke.</p>

<p>First it praised the eastern monsoon which gave them all health,
and blew the traders away on their voyages, then it foretold a rich
return when the wind veered and brought them home.</p>

<p>"Meet the men with songs, for they will come in safety when Rea is
a wife--"</p>

<p>"Ah!" grunted Kamo, as he heard this ending of the song, clutching
at the little hand nervously in the shadow.</p>

<p>"Rea, the daughter of the chief, who will bring much riches to her
father, and prosperity to the tribes.</p>

<p>"The tribes who are brothers of Hula.</p>

<p>"They shall swallow the enemy before them as the shark eats up the
little fish.</p>

<p>"Rejoice for your men who come back laden to dance at the marriage
of Rea.</p>

<p>"Who is the man to marry Rea?</p>

<p>"The wise man of the tribe.</p>

<p>"The rich man of the tribe.</p>

<p>"The good man of the tribe.</p>

<p>"Toto is good, he can buy his wife with many presents.</p>

<p>"He can keep his wife as the daughter of a chief ought to be
kept.</p>

<p>"He can--"</p>

<p>"Can he fight for her?" cried out the impulsive Kamo, springing up
from behind the circle of girls, and leaping right in front of the
huge ghost, which shrank back a little, while Toto looked up from
under his petticoat.</p>

<p>"Ho! men of Hula, there is the son-in-law of a chief for you, a
man to look at with a woman's raumma. Toto the wise, who makes money
out of your daughters; Toto the good, who has made Hula the cry of
Kerepuna and Hanuabada. Bah! he is a fine fellow, but let him keep to
the petticoat. She how he fights this brave man of Hula."</p>

<p>And Kamo, with a kick at a certain portion of Toto's person just
then presented to the gaze of the tribe, snapped his fingers
contemptuously, and stalked into the darkness.</p>

<h3>Chapter XVIII. On Board the "Sunflower."</h3>

<p>THE Sunflower flew before that east blast like a bird on the wing,
while Niggeree, who both knew his boat and the ocean before him, took
the wheel, as he always did in moments of emergency, while his men
stood ready to work at the ropes.</p>

<p>He passed the shoals and islands on the way, and by night had
brought to anchor near a hilly and rocky island which afforded a good
shelter, and where he knew of a good sand-bank near to him; here he
lay to, and waited, looking out for his consort.</p>

<p>It was with great anxiety he watched, for he had no intention of
losing sight of his friends. Hector knew where the gold was to be
found, and he wanted Collins to join him in a little pearl-fishing
expedition; Collins had both divers and dresses, &amp;c., with him,
which Niggeree was not in a position at present to purchase, but he
knew the ground, and so the partnership was one of capital and
experience, like that contract entered into once between the Jew and
the Scotchman, only in this instance it was reversed, the Greek had
the experience, and the Scotchman the capital.</p>

<p>After waiting till about midday on the look-out, he once more put
to sea, and before sunset brought up safely at Brampton Island.</p>

<p>From here he made for Mibu, and finally resolved to wait at Kiwai
till they should join him.</p>

<p>Here he fell upon his old master, Professor Killmann, with whom he
had previously explored the eastern coast, and who now hailed the
chance of aid, in recovering his vessel which he had been forced to
abandon to the natives, and take to the woods.</p>

<p>Professor Killmann had just come from Alligator Island, where he
was forced from his vessel, and compelled to walk overland about a
hundred and fifty miles through jungle and swamps, living as best he
could on the way and fighting as he went along; he presented a
deplorable sight, with his legs and feet swollen and covered with
sores, his clothes in rags, and his stalwart frame almost reduced to
a skeleton, but with spirit unsubdued, and the flames of revenge
burning in those deep-sunken dark eyes; here was the man of all men
whom Niggeree respected most, for he never spared an enemy, holding
men's lives as lightly as the lives of the insects he slaughtered and
preserved.</p>

<p>This time, as usual, he entered Kiwai alone, his followers had
been slaughtered by the natives, while he himself was wounded in
several places.</p>

<p>There were dark tales afloat concerning his actions, and it was
said that his name, coupled with that of Niggeree, was enough to send
the natives flying in a panic of fear into the jungle; they told how
he pitched dynamite charges wantonly into approaching canoes, without
waiting to learn their intentions, how he had shot down natives for
the sake of their beads, and once when his Chinese cook had asked
permission to go ashore to hunt for eggs, he had merely replied, "Go
if you like," but that as soon as the poor fellow had been landed, he
had given orders to steam away, and leave him behind. They tell how
when the cook saw the intention of being abandoned, that he rushed
down the shore, and held up his hands, imploring to be taken with
them, and that the Professor replied, "Oh, you do want that, do you?
hand me my gun, boy," and when the trembling islander handed it, he
coolly aimed at his cook and shot him dead, going ashore and bringing
the murdered body back again: they say the Custom-house officers at
Cooktown wondered where he had got that Chinaman which he carried in
a stone jar of spirits amongst his other specimens, and what he was
going to do with it when he got home, but he explained the matter to
their satisfaction, and as on that return voyage he had a fresh crew,
his explanation had to be taken.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how stories are carried about and exaggerated in
New Guinea; for instance, an action done at Port Moresby will be
related to the actor when he lands at East Cape, the news having gone
much quicker than his steamer or schooner can sail, even before a
fair wind.</p>

<p>So the reputed actions of Professor Killmann and his trader
friend, were whispered in every native village throughout the land,
and terror had invested them with the superhuman qualities of devils;
most improbable tales were told of their demoniac powers, how the
thunder and lightning obeyed them; this was the native version of the
dynamite--traps laid for them by the Professor; when he slept on
shore, they said, he laid traps in a circle of about half a mile in
extent, so that he could not be surprised, dropped lumps of the
explosive material amongst groups of natives as they sat on the shore
watching his vessel pass by, and laughed when he saw the pieces of
humanity shoot up amongst the trees.</p>

<p>But he wrote very nice accounts, for all that, of the natives, and
how little trouble they were to him; he related how he wept over the
death of a bird of paradise which he had heedlessly shot one morning:
they say he was writing this pathetic passage in his diary when he
suddenly observed a fine-looking boy pass along the bank with a
magnificent headdress on; "Quick, my gun," he cried, starting up and
laying down his pen in the hurry thoughtlessly across that pathetic
passage.</p>

<p>The next instant the native youth was lying shot through the head,
his Malay boy rowing ashore to get the magnificent specimen to add to
his other curios. They say the Professor swore very much in his own
language when he saw that his pen had made a blot on this beautiful
and pathetic passage, for he was very neat and cleanly in his habits
when he could be so, and liked to keep his MS. free of dirt.</p>

<p>"The parting was touching, and the regret mutual when I bade adieu
to this simple-minded people," so they say the Professor wrote in his
notes, and there was regret, the natives say, for they had sworn to
roast him alive, and did not like to see him sail away as he had
sailed, all alive.</p>

<p>"Will you go with me up the river?" asked Killmann, fixing his
glowing eyes on the Greek's dark face, while his own tightly-drawn
sallow skin flushed the colour of an amber lamp when lighted.</p>

<p>"Where have you left your crew?"</p>

<p>"I was surprised in the night, when ashore, and five of my boys
who held the ship killed before I knew anything about it."</p>

<p>"I suppose they knew too much to come to where you were
sleeping?"</p>

<p>"They lay in ambush all night, till I had taken up the traps, and
fell upon me as I was getting into my dingey, but, aha! they found
that they had made a leetle mistake."</p>

<p>"You blew the batch up?"</p>

<p>"The first batch--yes, they went up like sky-rockets; I waited
until they were in a compact mass, and about thirty yards distant,
and then threw my charge amongst them; those who were not broken into
pieces ran back again to the woods, which enabled us to get into the
stream; but, alas! they had some pretty ornaments upon them which I
was forced to abandon."</p>

<p>"They had possession of the ship, of course."</p>

<p>"That is so, exactly; we were hailed from the decks by a shower of
arrows, one entered my thigh, and the other stuck in my left
shoulder, while two of the boys were struck to the heart, still there
was more danger in retreating than in advancing, so we held on, and,
springing up the side, got amongst them, and then our revolvers did
the rest."</p>

<p>"What! you recaptured the ship?"</p>

<p>"On that occasion--ah, yes; but with a sacrifice: my engineer and
both firemen were slain, also all but one boy, who, being very badly
wounded, I thought it wiser to despatch without more ado, so that I
was alone amidst the enemy."</p>

<p>"What did you do next?"</p>

<p>"Exactly what you would have done, my friend. I waited till night,
setting up some of the dead men with caps and shirts upon them, and
guns in their hands, so that those watching from the bank might think
I had my crew.</p>

<p>"I went backwards and forwards, locking up my boxes of specimens
as best I could until it grew dusk. I knew they would not come before
midnight, so I made all ready. Over the hatchway I placed some small
machines which would not do much damage to the vessel, but a good
deal to the boarders; then I planted a chain of charges where I
thought them likely to step, after which, lashing the helm fairly on,
so that the ship would be more likely to keep to the centre of the
stream, where the current ran strongest, I cut through the cables,
and, letting her drift as best she might, I very gently slipped into
the stream, and swam over to the shore where last I saw them."</p>

<p>"Why there?"</p>

<p>"Because they would not expect to see me at that point. I went
softly to the thicket, and lay down to watch and listen.</p>

<p>"After a little time I could see the ship moving slowly down the
current. I knew they were on the alert, and would before long
perceive the change of position; and I was right, for soon they came
from a part not far from where I lay, and began to consult. I heard
them say we were escaping, so that it would be best to attack at
once, and as this was what I expected, and waited for, I was not
disappointed. They did not make any noise or blow the conch-shells,
so from that I felt sure there were not more than the one tribe
implicated, and they did not desire to share their plunder with any
neighbours, so I watched them all depart, one canoe after the other,
until I could count eight canoes, each loaded with about twenty men.
I felt sure that all had departed with the exception of the women,
children, and any old men, and that by stealing up to the village I
might take my revenge; but, alas! to do so would betray my presence
on shore too soon, which I did not wish to do, so I put aside the
strong temptation, and proceeded, instead, to follow the course of
the river, keeping the canoes and ship in sight.</p>

<p>"I could see them hang off for a while, not understanding the dead
silence on board, for they had some experience of me before that
morning, and feared a trap being laid for them; however, at last they
determined to make a dash for it, for they all raised a loud yell
together, and next moment were swarming up the sides.</p>

<p>"It came to pass just as I had planned--the first advancing line
trod upon the traps I had laid, for I heard the sharp detonations and
the flashing from different points of the vessel, as those coming
behind the first line fell backward in their fright into the canoes
and water with dull thuds or loud splashes, while the echoes of the
woods rang again with the shrill shrieks of those left writhing on
board; and so, partly satisfied, I took my departure.</p>

<p>"I kept as much as possible along the banks of the river, walking
cautiously till I had got a few miles from the village, then I lay
down to await the coming of light, so that I could dry my weapons; my
cartridges and dynamite charges were safe enough, as they were all
inside indiarubber bags.</p>

<p>"Well, my friend, there is no use going over the details of my
lonely march. You know what the land is like--in parts marshy, where
the alligators bask themselves--in parts dense and scarcely
penetrable, filled with prickly creepers, and ants which drop by
myriads as you crawl under the branches, and sting you in a thousand
places. My clothes were soon reduced to what you see them; my food
the leaves and herbs, as I could find them, with the sun blazing down
upon me during the day, and a hundred dangers to be encountered by
night, the damps which chill one to the bone and bring on the fever.
A fortnight ago I weighed fourteen stone, now I hardly carry eight;
but that is nothing, if I can have my revenge, and rescue my
specimens."</p>

<p>"Did you pass many villages?"</p>

<p>"A great number; but mostly all deserted and going to ruin; they
have been fighting with one another much lately, so that the ground
is pretty clear. Sometimes I heard the conches sounding, and at these
times I made a d&eacute;tour, keeping well out of sight. Once I saw a
furious battle, in which about two hundred lost their lives; the
victors walked past my place of concealment, in a line, carrying home
the bloody heads on long poles, with portions of the bodies in
baskets to cook. At one time I nearly walked into the midst of a
great feast before I was aware; the sun was going down and dazzled my
eyes so that I could not see, while the wind blowing from me
prevented me from smelling the smoke, so that I ran right into the
back of the outpost before I knew where I was; but before he could
turn round my hand was on his throat and my knife in his heart; I
dare not use my gun, as I did not know who might hear me at any time,
so I drew the body into the thicket and covered it with leaves, and
went on.</p>

<p>"I only once caught a pig, and that I also killed with my knife,
and devoured what I wanted raw. However, I have done the journey, and
feel well enough to return with you."</p>

<p>"But what of the native teachers, are they not up that
length?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they were; but I fear they will be slaughtered and devoured
by this time in my stead; yet, if they are not, it does not
matter,--they are my friends, and will not speak ill of my actions;
besides, they admit the necessity of making an example. You will come
with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I will," murmured Niggeree thoughtfully. "I left a
woman up there who will help us; but what will you give me for the
job?"</p>

<p>"Fifty pounds when we return, as much loot as you can take from
the natives we kill, what females you wish to spare for yourself, the
friendship of the missionaries, and a general permit, as soon as we
reach Moresby; nay, I will use my influence to get you a good post
with the government."</p>

<p>"The money and permit will do; I shall also want forgiveness for
some little scrapes in the past. You know the war-sloop is looking
out for me at present, and mad with me for that last trick I played
upon them."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! that was a very clever dodge of yours, Niggeree. Tell me
about it."</p>

<h3>Chapter XIX. Niggeree's Version of His Escapade.</h3>

<p>THE Professor filled his pipe and leaned back to enjoy the story,
while he meditated on his plans; he did not care much for the tale,
but he wished to please the Greek and enlist him in his cause, and he
knew well that Niggeree liked to hear himself speak of his own
exploits.</p>

<p>"You have heard how I got out of that trouble about the copra,
Professor?"</p>

<p>"No, my boy, tell it to me."</p>

<p>"Well, it happened in Milne Bay; I had made a station for myself
there, and married one of the chief's daughters. I always like to
marry where I make a station, for it gives the tribes an interest in
me."</p>

<p>"Very true," murmured the Professor, absently.</p>

<p>"We had a big corroberee over that wedding, for I had paid a good
price for the gal--two bags of rice, four pounds of tobacco, and a
full--grown female pig. She warn't worth it, of course, for these
native gals are like logs, they never wake up to a white fellow, no
matter how kind he may be to them, and deceive you right afore your
blessed eyes; but they know better than put on airs when I am on the
job. I only marry them to make the time pass, and get as much work as
I can out of my relations."</p>

<p>"Quite right."</p>

<p>"Wall, next morning, arter the marriage, I gets up to have a wash,
when who should I run against but the old man, her father, who stood
solemnly in my road, and would not move when I run against him.</p>

<p>"I looks at him a moment, and then taking him by the arm turns him
about and gives him a hearty kick, saying, 'You go, old bloke, and
get some fish for my breakfast,' at which he looked astonished for a
bit, and then walked away.</p>

<p>"One of the natives, who saw me kick him, comes up to me and tells
me that I was breaking a sacred law, that my father-in-law was
waiting for me to salute him, and that next time I met him I must
bend my head low and respectful when I passed him.</p>

<p>"'Oh, must I,' says I, 'we'll see about that when the time
comes.'</p>

<p>"The old boy brought me the fish, and we had breakfast all
together, boiled taro and fried fish, winding up with a puff at the
bau-bau, and a chew of the betel.</p>

<p>"That day we all went hunting the Wallabis, you know how it is
done, so no use explaining that process, but before night we had
bagged about thirty fine fat fellows, and had another great
feast.</p>

<p>"I missed my gal once during the feed, and sent a young fellow,
whom she had palmed off on me as her brother, to hunt her up; they
were both gone considerably longer than I liked to be kept waiting,
and when they did come back, all the natives burst out a laughing,
but wouldn't tell me what was the joke.</p>

<p>"Next morning I met the old man as before, right in my road,
waiting to be saluted; you bet I did salute him, although not exactly
us he cared about, after which I again sent him off to fish; then, by
way of a warning, I goes over to his hut where the old woman lay, and
treated her to a little of my fun.</p>

<p>"As I left the hut I sees one or two natives running up to see
what the matter had been; I suppose they had heard her screeching. My
gal also was coming out of our hut and behind her the young man I had
thought to be her brother; as she came along I saw a couple of sticks
of baccy drop out of her Raumua, which the young fellow picked up
with his toe and hid.</p>

<p>"'So that's the game, is it,' thought I. 'It isn't a brother
you're prigging my baccy for,' and I walks straight up to him and
caught him by the arm, shouting out, 'He is not her brother.'</p>

<p>"Then one of the old women comes up trembling and tells me that he
was her husband, and that she had committed bigamy when she came to
my hut.</p>

<p>"When I heard this I made up my mind to wind up this kind of
deceit, so I just took a couple of steps from him, and pulling out my
barker, I says, 'I give you a chance for your life while I count
five--run while you can.'</p>

<p>"But the darned young fool wouldn't run; he drew himself straight
up, and folding his arms, looked on me smiling, he had no weapons or
he might ha' done something else.</p>

<p>"'Run,' cried out his wife and the others, but he only smiled, and
looked at me without winking a lash.</p>

<p>"'One, two, three, four--'</p>

<p>"I hung on to the last word a bit, for I like pluck, and if he had
only turned, I'd have let him go; but there he stood like a target
afore me, and my gal, his wife, wringing her hands; I knew that I'd
have to fire or they'd think me afraid.</p>

<p>"One more chance.</p>

<p>"'F--I--V--E.'</p>

<p>"I drawled out the letters slowly, and at the last one let go.</p>

<p>"How she did it I cannot say, but when the smoke cleared they were
both there as dead as door-nails; the ball had gone through her back
and his breast, splitting both hearts with one shot, and they now
lay, her arms round his neck with her face down, and him a smiling
still at the sun. My pig and rice and baccy had been a swindle.</p>

<p>"The natives didn't say a word, but slunk back to their huts, and
left me alone with my smoking revolver and the two dead fools, in the
middle of the village.</p>

<p>"I knew after this there would be a rumpus, so I goes down to the
shore, and hailing my boys, told them to be ready for sailing when
the tide turned. Then I went back to the hut and begun to pack up my
traps.</p>

<p>"By-and-by the old man came, and I could see them creep out and
tell him what I'd done; his old woman also was jabbering away like an
old ape and pointing to where I was, while he lifted up both hands
and tore some of his white hair out, after which they all went into
the big house to consult.</p>

<p>"Meantime some of my boys came up and carried down my baggage and
put them aboard, while I goes over to the door of the big house, and
shouts to the old man to come out.</p>

<p>"'You old blackguard, you cheated me,' I said, when the old fellow
appeared, holding down his head and looking at the ground. 'I thought
the gal was single or I wouldn't have married her, and now it's all
your fault if she's dead, so give me back the price I paid for
her.'</p>

<p>"He didn't answer very plain, but mumbled something inside the
room, at which four young fellows started towards his hut, and came
out carrying the two bags of rice and the pig, with the tobacco.</p>

<p>"'That's all correct, says I. 'Put them in the dingey. Now, old
man, I am going off now; and as a punishment for your deceit, see
that you get me a cargo of copra ready by the time I come back."</p>

<p>"'When will you come?' asked the chief in a low voice.</p>

<p>"'Next moon! and if it's not ready--a full cargo, mind you, I'll
burn down your village and take six of your best-looking
wenches.'</p>

<p>"'We'll be ready for you, Niggeree,' replied he, and went back to
the hut.</p>

<p>"I sailed away at the turn of the tide, for I had some business to
get through at Brooker Island, and I thought it best to get out of
the road for a bit."</p>

<h3>Chapter XX. Niggeree's Version of His Escapade (Continued).</h3>

<p>"AT the end of a month I came back to the village, and found a
full cargo of copra all ready, and that's how the mistake took place
which cost me &pound;85 at Cooktown.</p>

<p>"You see, Professor, Captain Smith had been before me, and had
made a bargain with the natives to supply him with all the copra
which they could get ready for the next twelvemonth. This arrangement
the deceitful savages had never told me about; not, of course, that I
took the trouble to ask them, nor would I have paid much heed to what
they said, but it just happened to be one of them chances the
Government had been waiting on to convict me and get me turned off
the land.</p>

<p>"Well, the natives made a bit of a barney about letting me have
it. However, after I had set a light to their big house, which the
teacher owned was a good deed, as it was there all the mischief was
hatched, and run amuck amongst their women--married and single--they
gave in, and helped me with the cargo aboard, after which I up sails
and away before the sun went down towards Moresby.</p>

<p>"I got rid of the copra to the store there, and was just having a
bit of a spree, when in sails Smith with a mighty complaint to the
Governor, who straightaway seizes my vessel and takes me in his own
schooner over to Cooktown, to be tried for false possession; Smith
being the only witness.</p>

<p>"When we got to Cooktown a friend of mine bailed me out, and,
knowing Smith's inclinations, I hunted high and low till I came
across him, half drunk, in a shanty.</p>

<p>"'Have a drink, Smith?' says I. 'Right you are, mate,' says Smith.
So we sat down and had one or two nobblers, till I could see that he
was as drunk as an owl. Then I began.</p>

<p>"'Smith, my boy, I'm sorry over that mistake about the copra, and
I don't see the use o' going to law when we can settle it between
ourselves.'</p>

<p>"'Well, mate,' hiccuped Smith, 'what do you consider settling this
hash?'</p>

<p>"'What do you consider a fair price?'</p>

<p>"'Well, I consider sixty pounds none too much.'</p>

<p>"'There's your money, old boy,' says I, counting out the flimsies,
which, as he sees to be all right, he takes with a 'Thank ye,
Nig.'</p>

<p>"'Now, old man, just you sign this receipt and it's all square,
and we'll have another shout.'</p>

<p>"I had a receipt dated back two months, so he signs it, and I felt
pleased, and drunk him safely to bed.</p>

<p>"Well, I had a good man to look after me in court, for which I
paid &pound;20, and he saw me through it firstclass. The Governor
calls on his witness, certain of having me in for a year or two, when
no Smith turns up, much to his astonishment.</p>

<p>"'What is all this?' asked the magistrate.</p>

<p>"'Merely that a British subject has been wrongly accused, as this
here dockiment will prove,' and he handed my receipt.</p>

<p>"Meantime Smith had been found, and took his stand.</p>

<p>"'Did the prisoner purchase your copra from you, Captain
Smith?'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said Smith, shamefaced, and not liking to look up.</p>

<p>"Then my man made a splendid speech about the rank injustice of
the Queensland Government, and making me feel that noble that I
wondered if it was me he was describing, or some imaginary person who
was called by the same name. The Opposition papers also took up the
case, and made out long leaders about honest traders who were
obstructed and badgered by the present Government in their lawful
calling. I was taken over to Cooktown in irons, and left it like a
successful explorer.</p>

<p>"But for all that, when I went to renew my permit I was denied it,
and told that if I remained twenty-four hours on shore after getting
my ship ready, that it would be again seized by the Government, and
me treated as a pirate.</p>

<p>"'All right, so be it,' said I, snapping my fingers, 'and that for
your permit;' and I walked out, found Smith, who didn't show his face
to the Governor, and got a passage to Moresby with him."</p>

<p>"How did you raise the eighty pounds, Niggeree?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, I borrowed it from my Cooktown friend, and won it
all back at cards from Smith, and ten more to the good, before we
left Cooktown. Smith owned that copra cargo brought him bad luck, for
he lost through it the friendship of the Government and &pound;30 as
well, and vowed he'd never more try to come between me and my
rights.</p>

<p>"When I got to Moresby I assembled my boys, and sailed away to
Moto-moto, where I did a little trade; then the wind changed, and I
gets eastward to Dinner Island, and so on to Brooker, where I knew
I'd be safe, as the natives there have a very bad name.</p>

<p>"Well, after I left Dinner Island I got to another island where I
had left some natives, and they tells me that the bom-bom man was
after me to hang me. That was the time I made up my mind to play my
little trick. I goes over to the mainland in a canoe, after leaving
my boys and vessel safely at the outer edge of the island, then I
travelled overland till I comes to where they were lying, and, taking
a canoe, I boarded.</p>

<p>"'Who are you?' axed the captain.</p>

<p>"'A hunter,' says I, giving one of the hunters' names whom I
knew.</p>

<p>"'Do you know this part of the coast?'</p>

<p>"'As well as I do Burke Street.'</p>

<p>"'Have you seen a blackguard called Niggeree?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, captain; I know where to find him.'</p>

<p>"'Will you pilot us to him?'</p>

<p>"'How much will you give me?'</p>

<p>"'Ten pounds."</p>

<p>"'On the job?'</p>

<p>"'After we have found him.'</p>

<p>"'No, it must be now, or I won't go.'</p>

<p>"The captain was one of those mighty, fine-dressed, haughty,
soft--headed gentry which the naval service are so choke-a-block
with. I knew he had too little sense and too much dignity to
condescend making a bargain with me, so I took this way of getting up
his dander, and the cash out of him beforehand, and I was right; he
just frowned majestically upon me and stalked aft to his cabin,
sending the steward to pay me the money, as if it had been dirt.</p>

<p>"I guided them all right through the reefs, until we came to the
inner side of the island, where my ship lay, and where I knew he'd
take some trouble to get out of, and then he says,--</p>

<p>"'Is this the place, pilot?'</p>

<p>"'He was here, sir, last time I saw him; I'll go ashore and
inquire.' And the softy let me go.</p>

<p>"I made my road straight over the island, got up my anchor, and,
before we sailed, sent a line with a native to take to the haughty
naval captain. That's how it happened."</p>

<p>"He vows he will shoot or hang you for the trick," replied the
professor.</p>

<p>"He must catch me first," said Niggeree, laughing at his own
cleverness.</p>

<p>"Do you know he was very nearly stranded that time after you
left?"</p>

<p>"So they told me."</p>

<p>"However, I shall speak well for you when we return from our
expedition. When can you start?"</p>

<p>"Well, I am waiting on my consort. If she was in--"</p>

<p>"We shall leave word here that we have gone up the river, and they
may follow and help."</p>

<p>"That will do--yes, I'll go when you like."</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to-morrow morning we'll start at daybreak."</p>

<h3>Chapter XXI. Hafid Finds His Bride.</h3>

<p>WITHOUT doubt, General Flag-Croucher was the biggest personage who
had yet set military heels upon the coast of New Guinea.</p>

<p>He was not an explorer, although he had once upon a time tried to
organize an expedition in England, the purpose of which was to take
possession of the land something after the style of William at
Hastings, the noble General to be William the Conqueror, of course.
The project had fallen through, as a great many of the General's
projects fell to pieces, from lack of the one thing
needful--cash.</p>

<p>The General felt that he was born to be a leader of men; he was
himself a man of parts and inches. Having served all nations and
escaped from many dangers--decorated at different courts, police and
otherwise, he looked upon the world as his oyster, a very much alive
oyster, which his private necessities made him resolve at all hazards
to open as energetically as possible. He did not know anything about
either geology, botany, or those little points of learning which an
explorer requires to enable him to traverse a new country, but as he
emphatically remarked, "Damn it, sir!--a soldier, and a man who has
served under one hundred and eighty-five flags, surely don't want
knowledge to guide a body of men through the country of an enemy;
it's courage, sir!--courage does it, and I flatter myself I have
that."</p>

<p>He did flatter himself, very much at most times, when he had the
chance, this gallant general.</p>

<p>This was the first spectacle which greeted the eyes of Bowman and
Danby after they had anchored at Port Moresby, and been rowed
ashore;--a tall, gaunt, high-cheekboned, moustached figure, with
small blue-grey eyes, gleaming wildly under a much battered pulp
helmet; he stood in position number one, with feet advanced and
leaning on his staff, as a leader of armies might appear when
reviewing his troops. He was not very well dressed, but then no one
dressed much at Moresby except the Governor and his limited staff;
the General's costume consisted of a pair of muchpatched breeches, a
stained red sash, into which he had stuck an old rusted revolver, a
flannel-shirt originally white, now grey from use and lack of
soap--the native washer had declined to trust the hero any longer,
and he had too much dignity to do his own washing. An old yellow silk
jacket completed the outer man. This costume the General had adopted
on leaving Brisbane some few months before, and not at present
employing a servant, he wisely did not encumber himself with more
luggage than he could carry easily, for in hot countries an extra
shirt even becomes cumbersome, and the General did not like to be
encumbered, so he did not carry an extra shirt.</p>

<p>The Thunder had some of the varied experience of the other vessels
in crossing the stormy Gulf of Papua; but having the advantage of
steam, had been able to steer a pretty straight course, luck serving
the gallant old sea-dog of a skipper in better stead than
knowledge.</p>

<p>Poor Hafid found his peace at Murray Island; he had made no
further effort to retain life after that disappointment at Darnley,
but passed into the sleep of death as a lamp going out without oil,
painlessly and quietly, with the steady decrease of light until the
final flicker came before the flame expired.</p>

<p>We have all watched the lamp grow dry and the flame diminish as
the wick became charred; now we turn it up, gaining but a moment
longer, while we read a few lines more,--so they tried to reanimate
the soul that was passing out of that hope-dried heart, and thought
when they saw the mirage of a smile that he was getting over it.</p>

<p>The flame does not always leap up when it leaves that crusted
wick--edge; but in light, as in life, there must always be a last
moment when the ambient spirit lets go its grasp of the material.</p>

<p>Hafid went out like the lamp, and had but an instant's re-lighting
as the soul went out--that instant of illumination when the senses
are supplanted by the outer influences, and revelation takes the
place of instinct. To those about him it seemed only to be the
stretching-out of arms towards the setting sun and distant
palm-fringed strand, the dawn of a pallid flush behind the olive
cheeks, and the opening of the mouth as the sigh went forth, while
from the deep-set eyes a gleam shone out like a shaft of golden
sunshine mingled with amber; then the head fell back on the seaman's
jacket they had laid for a pillow, and the opalescent space above
became dimly reflected in the glazing eyes.</p>

<p>That instant had given to Hafid all his desires, the woman he
loved and the mud-flats of the Ganges;--true, she herself may have
forgotten his existence, and, while he held her girl-shape in his
outspread arms, may have been toiling from the paddy fields of his
successor and her master, dragging her weary load homewards, with the
last of the other man's brood clinging to the prematurely withered
breasts of this mindless slave.</p>

<p>What mattered the reality, if the vision was radiant which those
heaven-lighted eyes beheld? What mattered the pitiless march of time,
if the spirit was young and ardent which that flying spirit caught in
its passage and bore onwards in its close embrace?</p>

<p>Perhaps, as the woman paused in her homeward walk to change the
infant to the other pendulous breast, the hot yellow sun-shaft smote
her in the wearied eyes and pierced her dazed brain with a stroke of
memory that cast the shards of labour and affliction from her,
renewing in that quicker pulse of her sluggish blood the throbs of a
day gone by, when her heart beat fast and her shape was round and
smooth as satin; perhaps on that shaft of sunlight her soul sped
forth to join the other soul not far away.</p>

<p>Who can tell how a life may be filled out in a second, or eternity
accomplished in a glance, as she trudges onward with her load? the
dead body of Hafid is not more lifeless than that living burden by
the Ganges. Happy each that they can only see love in his eternal
youth.</p>

<p>They buried Hafid before they left Murray Island;--he lies in the
little mission graveyard under the shadow of the sago palms, where
the sea--breezes rustle softly through the long grasses and pensile
branches, and leaves droop down; where the sounds of the silky
rustlings are blent with the bubbling of the wavelets as they roll
gently amongst the lovely shells.</p>

<p>Here, at this island, they were entertained by the missionaries,
this being one of the headquarters of the Society. Here they found
the natives orderly and docile, their savage traits seemingly
subdued, and cleanliness with comfort pervading every hut and
bungalow. It was a pleasant sight to see the genial influence of
religion here. It was a good memory to carry away, the devotion and
brotherhood of the self-exiled men and women who labour here so far
from the friends they may never see again.</p>

<p>A bundle of newspapers, more than four months old, was seized with
avidity by the young teacher who had at present taken up his quarters
at the house upon the hill. He had been forced to leave New Guinea,
having caught the fever there; he was just getting over it, but very
weak and listless.</p>

<p>Here they saw amongst the black skins, the pallid features of a
delicate woman, one of those gentle heroines, who move quietly in
their onward path, braving danger which would appall many bold men;
enduring troubles which might well break down the strongest mind. She
was wasted almost to a shadow by repeated attacks of the malaria; she
seemed like one of those bloodless, but refined creations of
Orchardson, with eyes and lips alike blanched with the debilitation
of that soft but insidious breeze, yet she moved with languid grace
to do her duty to the young teacher whose life she had saved, to the
husband whose troubles she shared, and she felt the thousand
anxieties which only a refined woman can endure amongst savages, even
though they are so far reclaimed. Here she lived with none of her own
sex of her own colour, with her children about her, bearing her fate
as a daily cross.</p>

<p>The white and dark children played and splashed about the clear
waters, coral-protected from the sharks who swarmed outside. Both
white and dark children swam with equal ease; they were equally shy
at the sight of strangers as they were at home in the sea, and the
curious part of it all was that the white children spoke the native
language fluently and their mother-tongue with considerable
difficulty.</p>

<p>From Murray Island, with its memories, the Thunder ploughed across
the briny furrows, and tossed and tumbled in a most fearful manner
upon the storm-beaten ocean; there was nothing which could stand
upright, or keep its place when the Thunder was on the roll. From
captain to steward they fell about in utter disregard of all the laws
of gravity, while the only object that appeared to retain its
equilibrium was the solitary rat which they had fattened since
leaving port.</p>

<p>This rat nibbled calmly and gleaned a rich harvest, while the
plates and cups rattled about him. He had lived upon the best, and
grown out of all proportion for the size of the hole which formed his
first retreat; now he was compelled to hide in out-of-the-way
corners, and dodge the knives and forks which Danby shied at him as
they sat opposite one another--the rat clinging to the floor, while
Danby clutched at the table. Sometimes the rat, in its endeavours to
evade the missile, lost its hold and slid for a yard or two, but not
far before recovering its balance. The rat seemed to be the best-fed
sailor on board.</p>

<p>The captain called his vessel the "Hummer," as a term of
endearment. He always used this pet name when she spun extra
furiously round, or as he recovered himself after one of her most
forcible thuds; at such moments he would pass his hands over his
matted locks to feel if the skull was not fractured, then clearing
the mist from his eyes, as he sat upon the floor and held on to the
table-leg, "Aint she a little hummer?"</p>

<p>The Thunder did not always go as her captain wished her to go, she
did not often obey her propeller, either; but she always went, if not
in an orthodox way, in a manner peculiarly all her own.</p>

<p>Through the Papuan Gulf she rocked, upsetting all ideas of
propriety as regards the progress of screwguided craft; indeed,
upsetting all which could be upset in the material, as well as ideal
laws of order. She appeared to have such a contempt for waves, that
she could in no other manner express it so well as sitting upon them,
and as she was by build a heavy sitter, when she sat down the wave
was generally squashed; also, as a rule, when she chose to sit, every
object within or upon her had to leap.</p>

<p>One, two, THREE! that is how the little hummer asserted her
position and the inferiority of the advancing wave--one, a slight
premonitory touch; two, a decided thud, and three, the total collapse
of convulsed nature.</p>

<p>Number three was a clash like the colliding of two trains, or the
chance meeting of rival stars; but the Thunder seemed to be the least
conscious of the accident, for next moment she rose as easily to
repeat the motion of contempt, as a ball-room belle might rise to her
twentieth invitation. In one sense she strongly resembled the lady in
question, inasmuch as when not sitting she was the rest of her time
waltzing.</p>

<p>Many were the ghastly legends told of her aquatic feats, the
fearful havoc she had made in former trips amongst the property and
persons of those who had entrusted their fates to her tender mercies;
dark hints of her diabolic powers were not wanting, how she had
encountered and overcome difficulties in the form of sandbanks and
rocks, which would have wrecked the strongest-built ironclads. Gaps
were pointed out even in the great barrier reef as the traces of
spots she had butted against and broken through; these might be
sailors yarns, of course, and slightly exaggerated truth, yet a
general belief prevailed on board from the humble Sudy boy to the
Irish mate, that while her present Ajax-looking skipper
controlled--or rather yielded to her whims, and stuck faithful to her
caprices, wreckage was an impossibility; the reef might be wrecked,
but the Thunder never, and all things considered it consoled those
aboard for the hourly fractures received.</p>

<p>Through the storm and the gulf they lived, and after three long
days and nights of bodily and mental anguish, sighted the lofty
mountains of New Guinea.</p>

<p>It was early morning when from the mellow haze the vast
proportions upheaved, and the captain exclaimed joyously, yet in a
tone of astonishment,--</p>

<p>"New Guinea, by----"</p>

<p>"You didn't expect it to be Africa, did you?" inquired the calm
young Danby.</p>

<p>"Where is it?" asked Bowman, getting up from his deck-pillow,
yellow-faced and bilious-looking, and rubbing his heavy eyes with his
dirty hands--no man could wash or eat, while the Thunder swept the
main.</p>

<p>"Over there, about ten miles off."</p>

<p>"Which part do you think it is?" again inquired Bowman.</p>

<p>"Well, it ought to be Moresby by the course and charts; but
somehow I don't think it is," answered the captain doubtfully, and
scratching his head.</p>

<p>The old Malay at the wheel looked ahead steadily for a moment,
and, as he had been to the coast before, they all looked towards him
for instruction.</p>

<p>"Mount Yule over there, sir!"</p>

<p>"Good," cried the skipper, merrily, "she's done well. We are only
sixty miles out of our course, and she's a little hummer."</p>

<h3>Chapter XXII. Yule Island.</h3>

<p>THEY made Yule Island about ten o'clock. Here they were met by the
two French missionaries, Fathers Ambrose and Durand, who, having been
denied permission to land on any portion of the mainland, took up
their station upon the island, which is divided by only a narrow
strip of water from the mainland.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is a wonderful system this law of permits in New
Guinea, where three or four people grant, or deny permission to
people wishing to land, as they--the three or four representatives of
this protective Government--think proper to decide, without chance of
appeal or redress. Of course, it is only a moral obligation which
makes the simple--minded traders or visitors bend under this very
illegal system of justice, and the Governor does not often strain his
despotic authority; still that the system prevails is vile as a
precedent, and that those Catholic preachers were compelled to resort
to stratagems, before they could preach the charity of Christianity,
is almost too great a sacrifice in this liberal nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>When I say moral obligation I mean that these permits are only
farces, which the good temper of the genial traders humours; for what
is there to prevent three or four men from landing at any time on the
shores of New Guinea, in spite of all the permits issued or refused
by any Government? The land is theirs in exactly the same sense as it
belongs to the Government or to the missionary, i.e. it belongs to
neither.</p>

<p>Father Ambrose, like nearly all Papist missionaries, did not value
his life much when he took up his work in this Protestant-abandoned
island; he lay down to sleep each night, at first, expecting only to
wake in the company of saints and martyrs. He saw that with the old
savages the rites of Christianity were idle ceremonies, and that to
try to teach them religion was a hopeless task, so he made up his
mind to be content with getting a baby baptized now and again,
meantime seeking by force of example, till he had learnt their
language, to give them some faint notion of the laws of health.</p>

<p>By dint of indomitable perseverance he mastered, in a very short
time, their dialect, and then he went amongst them healing their sick
and modifying, as far as he best could do, their savage, bloodthirsty
customs;--in eight months his mild example, patient forbearance, and
ready help had worked almost a reformation on Yule Island and the
adjacent mainland occupied by his rivals in the good work.</p>

<p>He did not gain his present influence without danger, hardship, or
sacrifice; once, when they made up their minds to slaughter him and
his two companions, he mastered them by courage only.</p>

<p>One of the chiefs had received from him payment for some work to
be performed; the chief, like most people paid beforehand, thought
how he might evade his promise, and appeared before him with a
plausible story, thinking it an easy matter to take in the gentle
Frenchman.</p>

<p>He told his lie badly and was discovered, upon which Father
Ambrose sternly ordered him never to come before him again unless it
was to pay his debt.</p>

<p>The chief threatened him with death, at which the missionary only
smiled, and passed indoors, leaving the native to go off with
vengeance in his heart.</p>

<p>That night Father Ambrose was awakened by yells outside, and
getting up he muttered a quiet prayer in the dark.</p>

<p>"Come out, you white pig, and let us see you. We want your head to
roast!"</p>

<p>These were the words which he heard as he rose from his knees, and
without a pause he opened the door and went out into the
moonlight.</p>

<p>Over two hundred naked and armed savages stood in the clear space
in front of his palisade, with the chief, his enemy, in front.</p>

<p>A little awe still held them back, for the fire of the white man
was known to them, and they did not yet fully gauge the extent of his
power. A dark, threatening, howling crowd, with waving arms and
clashing spears, while the full moon-rays shone upon their supple,
smooth skins and wicker-work shields, casting black shadows on to the
ground, dancing shadows, like tangible and contorted figures with
grey phantoms above them.</p>

<p>"I am here; what is it you want?"</p>

<p>"Your head, white pig!" shouted the tall chief, advancing swiftly
with quivering lance poised above his head.</p>

<p>"Well, come and take it."</p>

<p>The savage paused in a stupor of amazement. Father Ambrose stood
quietly but upright, clad only in trousers and shirt, his thin face
gleaming pale in the white light, with his shirt taking on silver
edges where surfaces of the folds were exposed; his brown beard
looked soft and surrounded with a strange lustre, as the rays caught
it with a softened shine--a mild, patient head they wanted, like the
misty outlines of St. John.</p>

<p>They saw he was unarmed, and, as they looked at his folded hands
and meek head, a strange terror ran like a thrill through all. Never
had enemy seemed so formidable to them, this passive resistance
filled them with feeling as of a supernatural power; surely he must
be immortal to wait so quietly, and no spear could pierce him!</p>

<p>"What! Do you think we cannot kill you?" cried out the chief,
plucking up some faint show of courage.</p>

<p>"Kill me, if you like."</p>

<p>The words were simply and softly spoken, as by one about to
receive his reward; but the effect was instantaneous. With a
universal howl of dismay and horror the camp broke up, and the
warriors fled back to their village, no man resting till he had
covered his head with his wife's rauma.</p>

<p>When the missionary opened his eyes he was alone, with the holy
moonlight shining over the weapons, flung down in the hurry of that
complete rout, lying in confused masses in front of him. Truly a
miracle had been performed, as when the Assyrians fled in the
night.</p>

<p>"My hour has not yet come," he sighed, half regretfully, as he
knelt down once more to his midnight prayers, while his two brothers,
who had stood trembling inside, went quietly out and gathered up the
spears and other trophies left behind.</p>

<p>From that day no native sought to hurt him; the life of the man
who wished to be killed was sacred, and the respect born of fear grew
up into a child of love, when they came to know and benefit by his
goodness.</p>

<p>Next day the old chief came with the payment of his debt, to
implore the pardon of his friend--came on his knees, with his
kneeling warriors behind, asking him to forgive them and stay amongst
them. To each man he gave back his weapon, consecrated, and with
words of pardon and loving-kindness. Thus peace was won with very
little trouble; so Father Ambrose pleasantly informed Mr. Bowman.</p>

<p>The sight of the natives, who came in their canoes, was not
reassuring to those on board the steamer--stalwart young men,
perfectly nude, who made their catamarans rush through the sunny
waves, and the foam hiss from their paddles, while they grunted as
they bent their brown backs to the task, and the sinews and muscles
moved and swelled--young men who seemed to be without an instinct of
fear or caution, as they caught hold of the rope-end hanging over the
bulwarks and slung themselves with a single bound on to the deck,
where they stood upright and dauntlessly facing the strangers, while
the sun-beams glinted on their smooth limbs and shining breasts like
burnished copper--young men who came armed with spears, bows and
arrows, with mop-heads stuck over with gay feathers and long-handled
combs, with cheeks painted with stripes white and black, with sinews
of trained athletes, who neither understood fear or displayed
astonishment.</p>

<p>They were the friends of the priest, and, trusting him, trusted
all whom he appeared friendly with. He told Bowman and Danby, as he
sat down to lunch, that they were now perfectly safe, and offered to
show them the beauties of the island; so, as soon as they had
finished eating, they accepted his kindly offer, and got into his
boat, while the natives once more went ahead and around them in their
canoes, leading the way.</p>

<p>They found a natural stone landing-place as they drew near the
shore, a long causeway of slaty-looking rocks, worn flat, and like
steps, leading up from the water's edge into a somewhat dense
thicket. On each side of this stone landing-place the mango-bushes
grew, and dipped into the deep waters.</p>

<p>Past the landing-place they came to a footpath going through
fields of long cane-grass, which closed high above their heads as
they passed through it, folding them in so that they had to keep very
near to the heels of their guides, and look well to their feet, or
they would have been lost entirely, for as they dipped into the
hollows this grass grew to the height of ten, twelve, and in parts
fifteen feet, of a dry-hay colour, yet strong and fibrous, touching
with strong clutches like withes of reeds, and gathering behind them
like giant corn-stalks. When they rose to the high places, where the
ground was more stony and drained, they could overlook this virgin
grass and see the hills: in parts stony, in parts grass--covered,
like the ground they traversed, and in detached portions patched with
dense jungle, which began and ended abruptly; here the wild boar lay
with her litter, and the game-birds hid themselves.</p>

<p>They were passing by the side of a valley cultivated by the
natives. Here, as they looked along, they saw gardens of yams, taro,
rice, with plantations of banana, sago, betel, and sugar-cane brakes;
over against them, on the further ridge of the valley, they could see
above the fields and trees the palm-thatched houses of a native
village. This was the only village on the island as yet which held
out against the benign influence of Father Ambrose. They were coming
in, he observed, as he pointed them out; that is, they didn't throw
spears now, as they used to do, when strangers passed, or lie in wait
with their man-traps, which was a great concession, certainly.</p>

<p>Behind them the sea gleamed like a deep sapphire--that intense
blue which seems to engross within its centre all the colours from
the paler immensity above, taking in light, and giving out again only
the suggestion of fathomless depth and movement.</p>

<p>The little, commonplace, red, white and black painted and
varnished Thunder lay upon this lovely indescribable tone of blue,
like a child's cheap toy laid upon a widespread sheet of rare spun
silk.</p>

<p>Before them, as they walked, they could see the house which the
missionary and his brothers had raised, standing upon a little mound
in the valley, with the flag fluttering feebly in the soft breeze
from its staff--a white flag, with the device of the bleeding heart
wrought upon it in red silk by the little sisters of Thursday
Island.</p>

<p>"Our mission-house, gentlemen," observed Father Ambrose, with a
touch of honest pride in his gentle voice; "beyond there lies the sea
on all sides, with the coast of New Guinea to the east. No, you
cannot see Mount Yule from here; but from the top of that hill you
will see it, also the two villages, who now listen to my words. My
little chapel lies down by the seashore, between the villages. It
does not do to raise jealousy, gentlemen, so, although it is some
distance for me to walk, still it is near to them both. I will take
you to see it after you have rested in our little station."</p>

<h3>Chapter XXIII. A Hunting Expedition.</h3>

<p>AFTER a bottle of very harmless, home-brewed beer, qualified
afterwards by a glass of the best French brandy which they had yet
tasted, they set forth on their tour over the island, accompanied by
the two priests, who were armed with very antiquated, barrel-loading
fowling-guns--the sort of articles which you load from the top,
pouring down small shot and ramming them home with a rod--I dare say
about the only relics now to be found outside of an old iron and rag
store.</p>

<p>These guns were evidence in themselves of the pacific intentions
of the missionaries--warranted to make a great noise and do very
little damage.</p>

<p>They met with no success in their search for game that afternoon;
once they started a bush turkey, which Danby attempted to stalk, but
he found the bird too much for him. The sides of the mountain here
were in parts very barren, covered with loose crumbling earth and
small stones, and very steep, so that climbing became a very
difficult feat. After a while they reached the edge of a thicket,
dense and dry-looking, with much dead wood, and hard to get through
on account of the confusion of interlacing tendrils, all withered and
shrunken. Here they found tracks of the wild boar, with deep, dark
intersections, water-worn cuttings, which were completely covered in
by closely-woven networks of branches and shrivelled leaves. Here, as
they stooped and laboured to get through, the heat was intense and
most oppressive in the broken light, while under the feet crunched
the dry twigs, and from the blighted-looking leafage and clusters of
delicate orchids which battened upon the dry branches, dropped
myriads of small yellow ants, covering the exposed portions of the
body, and getting under the shirts and up the trousers, while they
bit and stung with a maddening sharpness from which there was no
getting away; these ants are worst in the dry thickets on the
mountain sides and summits.</p>

<p>Father Ambrose smiled apologetically as Bowman and Danby danced
about, and used their Saxon with unadulterated and emphatic purity,
and when they emerged from this purgatory he energetically set to
work brushing off the tiny tormentors from his companions, seemingly
unconscious of the legions in possession of his own person.</p>

<p>"Don't they bite you, Father?" asked Bowman, turning to assist the
priest, after he had been liberated.</p>

<p>"Yes! a little, just enough to give me a lesson in patience; we
require that virtue in our work out here."</p>

<p>Father Ambrose's deep-set, blue eyes had a very far-away look as
he said this--a look in which hopeless melancholy was blent with
apathetic resignation--yet his lips still wore the set, gentle smile
which did duty for contentment.</p>

<p>"Are you getting many converts here?" asked Bowman next.</p>

<p>"I do not try to get converts; I am content if I can civilize them
a little more, teach them to bury their dead so that the survivors
may not suffer in consequence; and I teach them not to eat their
enemies. They are a wise people in many ways, but they have no
religion, and will not be taught to believe in spiritual benefits.
When I say mass they come and look on; the little prints which I have
placed round the walls seem to amuse them, and I believe that
unconsciously they get the benefit of my prayers; to attempt more
would be to fail. So far I have not laboured in vain, for they come
for my advice when in trouble and perplexity, and I do what I can to
give them good advice; this is all which I seek to achieve in my
life-time."</p>

<p>"Do you intend staying here long?" inquired Danby,
irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"I hope to die here, my friend," replied the priest gravely.</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten your own land?"</p>

<p>"Ah, France! No, I can never forget it; but we who are the
servants of God have no land on carth, as we have no ties; it is easy
for us to be able to make sacrifices, easier than for your ministers
who have their wives and children to think about. I wonder sometimes
how they can be missionaries with bonds like these holding them back;
I think they must be very brave men, much more so than I could
be."</p>

<p>"That's a matter of opinion," muttered Bowman grimly, remembering
a few other motives which the simple Romanist overlooked.</p>

<p>They were now walking through the fields towards the sea-beach,
along which the native villages were built. A slight turn from the
pathway brought them to another thicket, differing altogether from
the one on the hill; here the parasites were covered with greenery,
and the leaves were moist and cool, while the soil felt swampy with
the constant drippings.</p>

<p>A dense thicket composed of sugar-cane, partly cultivated, with
castor--oil plants shooting up here and there and long lush grasses
which bent and fell over with their own weight. They did not
penetrate very far, but could see that here lay a rich harvest for
the future workers when their time came.</p>

<p>They now passed through the fields towards the native villages,
Father Ambrose leading the way with rapid strides, while the others
followed as well as they could, guided by the sound of the rustling
grass which closed over their heads; frequently he had to shout out
to show his direction, for it was all a wild stampede through moving
blades. As they went on sometimes the ground rose and the grass
became scanter, when they had a passing glimpse of heads in front
before they dipped out of sight.</p>

<p>On one of these barren mounds the missionary paused to take breath
and allow his companions to get up to him. As they stood he pointed
out Mount Yule with its flat table-top, and the island spreading
round; the mission-station stood out boldly against the mellow
afternoon sky, while beneath them lay the two native villages, Rolto
Arriena and Morna Cherne.</p>

<p>"My chapel is just between the two villages, behind that dark
clump of trees, and if we make haste we shall be able to see it
before the sun goes down."</p>

<p>They all hastened after this, and making a d&eacute;tour by the
edge of the cultivated fields, passed through Morna Chorna, with its
huts raised amongst the clusters of cocoa-nut palms, and where the
natives very gravely welcomed them.</p>

<p>"There has been a death here last night, and they are all
mourning, otherwise we might have had some fun."</p>

<p>At the entrance to the village a young native met them with his
body ash-smeared, and carrying in his hand a small firebrand which he
was blowing hard upon to keep alight, with a most dejected appearance
of melancholy. The good priest stopping him asked him a few
questions, receiving very hopeless replies, after which he turned
round and explained that this was the eldest son of the dead man whom
they were mourning for at the village; being the eldest son, his part
of the rites consisted of holding lonely night vigils in the forest.
At each sundown he left the corpse to pass the hours till daybreak in
the woods, and, as all natives dread the darkness, and believe
implicitly in ghosts and evil demons, the horror of those lonely
hours more than counterbalanced the grief which he might otherwise
have felt at his affliction; the firebrand was to light the fire
which he said would keep away the ghosts, so that the blowing part
was a most important one with him, as all his thoughts were
concentrated in the effort to keep it alight, and yet make it last
the mile or two of distance between the wood and the village.</p>

<p>Poor boy, I doubt if he felt much for his father, as he left them
to go on his lonely watch; what feelings he still retained were
evidently expended upon himself.</p>

<p>It is very wonderful how pitiful we all can become when self
poises up as the victim, how pathetic we grow over our own miseries,
and how we wonder that other people cannot see them in exactly the
same light as we do; but fortunately for the unity of the world, and
unfortunately for the individual cause, each applicant to pity is so
intent upon his own case that he has no time to devote to his
neighbour's wrongs, so each atom in the grand whole plan goes on
wriggling his own wriggle while maintained in his own circumscribed
space by a stern order of economy far beyond human judgment, and the
man is of no more account than the sparrow who may drop dead from his
perch without, as far as we know, any sentimental self-condolence.
This is a truth which man cannot learn in youth, or in age either, if
God has answered his cry for "daily bread;" it is only revealed to
those who rise up hopeless and lie down wanting, in spite of their
everlasting cry, "Our Father!"</p>

<p>Inside the village named Roiro Arrienna they found great
preparations going on for the funeral of the old chief; so that with
little persuasion Father Ambrose induced the visitors to wait and
witness the ceremony.</p>

<p>All night and during the early part of the day, the relatives and
friends had spent their strength weeping and lamenting wildly; they
did not seem to have any deity to appeal to or reproach in this their
hour of grief and woe. The French priest explained that this was the
hopeless part of the missionary's work, the futile endeavours to
create a faith or the necessity man has to own a greater power beyond
his comprehension; what they could see and touch they would credit,
but nothing beyond, yet they feared the darkness as children do, and
had vague notions about ghosts and evil spirits--the world beyond was
a world to regard with horror as something evil.</p>

<p>As they drew near to the hut where the body lay in solemn state,
and where a large number of the natives had assembled--the relatives
easily to be distinguished by the black ashes with which they were
thickly bedaubed--two women and two men came out carrying the nude
body between them, supported on bamboo-poles and cross-pieces. The
grave had been dug in the centre of the village between two cocoa-nut
palms, about two feet in depth, a mere scraping away of the loose
sea-sand.</p>

<p>Then the younger son brought out the sleeping-mat of the dead man,
and carefully laid it in the bottom of the grave, upon which the body
was gently placed, while the outside mourners stood silently
watching.</p>

<p>When this portion was finished a lane was made in the crowd, down
which the widow with her daughers, rushed with bitter cries, plunging
themselves wildly upon the body and tearing out their hair, while a
party of young men went slowly round and round the grave chanting an
extempore ditty of laudation of the departed one's great deeds and
virtues, beating loudly all the time upon drums, while over the scene
the ruddy rays of the setting sun slanted between the palms, and made
long sombre shadows over the level sands.</p>

<p>"We had better leave them now," whispered Father Ambrose, hastily,
making the sign of the cross over the grave, and moving away.</p>

<p>It might have been a warning the good priest meant, or only his
sense of delicacy, or perhaps a blending of the two qualities, for as
they moved towards the open space, they could not help noticing one
or two evil glances directed towards them from the crowd of silent
onlookers, while the women were rapidly following the group who had
now taken off the widow and her daughters, leaving the men by
themselves--always a dangerous sign with savages.</p>

<p>"A lovely sunset, is it not?" observed the priest, as they walked
along the sea-shore, which was thickly strewn with many varieties of
delicately-coloured and beautifully-shaped shells. "A lovely sunset
compensates for much discomfort and danger, yet we must walk quickly
if you would see my church before it grows dark. Are your revolvers
loaded?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the company; "why?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to fear, only do not look round; but see if you can hit
that branch over there."</p>

<p>A branch of cotton-tree gleamed out of the dark mass of foliage
where he pointed, like a bar of gold with its scarlet blossom
intensely red where the sunray caught it, as the priest pointed out
the mark. Bowman raising his weapon, took a quick aim, and with the
sharp report the flower-clad branch fell at the feet of Danby, who
picked it up.</p>

<p>"A very good shot," murmured Father Ambrose, "and quite effective
for the present. Now we may get along in peace."</p>

<p>Bowman glanced back as he heard these words, to see a retreating
band of natives; evidently the report had frightened them from
whatever evil intention they had in view, for a couple of spears lay
on the sand.</p>

<p>"Hallo! was it going to be an attack, Father?" cried Bowman, in a
startled voice.</p>

<p>"I was half afraid it might have been, as I gathered from a word
or two dropped during the ceremony. I think they were beginning to
charge one of you with having the evil eye which had caused the
death; they are like children, and will not listen to reason, but
they know enough to respect the gun of the white man. Yet, had you
missed that branch, I fear we would have had to fight."</p>

<p>The cotton-tree branch became at once an object of general
interest.</p>

<p>"Yes! to-night they will go back and tell a wonderful tale about
the fire-stick that speaks and kills without touching, and to-morrow
the tree will be regarded with great awe. We have time just to get a
short look at the church, and then home."</p>

<p>They had now reached the little hut, which was dignified by the
title of church, and the priest unlocking the door, showed them with
a gentle apology the interior: rude log walls, whereon were tacked a
few cheap and highly-coloured prints of the Passion, with a couple of
rough packing-cases raised up on end to form the altar, covered with
a white table-cloth, and two candles stuck upon wooden sticks--a
place for thoughtless people to laugh at, yet not even the careless
Danby felt inclined to smile, as the poor priest uncovered and
entered with bent head.</p>

<p>"They come to look at my pictures, and I pray for them while they
are looking. You will excuse me, gentlemen; just one moment, while I
thank God that we have escaped a danger."</p>

<p>He quietly knelt down before the altar with his two brothers,
while the others looked round them for a moment, and then with one
impulse turned towards the setting sun.</p>

<p>Over between them and that orange and crimson lustre lay the
sea-built village of Morna Cherna, now completely deserted, as the
two closely--connected villages were allies, and the inhabitants had
joined in the funeral ceremonies, and also possibly with the
avengers.</p>

<p>A canoe or two lying idle on the sands; some mats and
d&eacute;bris of cooking, with cooking utensils scattered about. The
houses, built on piles of about four and five feet above water-mark,
line both sides of the beach, and form a square at the end, with the
ocean outside shivering and glittering as it passes downward from the
sun, now seemingly dipping into it to the wave-lapped strand.</p>

<p>Behind the houses on the shore side lie dense thickets of
mangrove, cotton, and tamarind trees, with the occasional feathery
tops of the palms, or bare white branches of dead wood projecting: a
tropic bush ever presents to the eye a mingling of the seasons, where
death instead of winter strips the leaves.</p>

<p>There is silence on the shore and in the forest, for the houses
are tenantless, and the birds have gone to roost. They do not lock
doors when they go out in New Guinea, and their dogs are too sociable
to stay behind their masters, so, fortunately for the travellers,
they had no danger to apprehend from the village through which they
had to pass. Danger might lurk amongst the mangroves when darkness
came on, yet even here they felt comparatively safe, guarded as they
were by the fears of the natives for their speaking-tubes, joined to
their horror of the night. The natives make night-attacks on enemies
but seldom, unless they have the moon to guide them: this night would
be dark as pitch, and from the appearance of the sky likely to be a
rough one.</p>

<p>The sun was a round globe of fire surrounded by dense purple fumes
and overhung with swarming masses of orange and vermilion, with
intersections of emerald green, and overhead, deep streaks and
rivulets of intense blue, with dun-coloured clouds, like broken-up
and cracked clay banks on a swampy land beginning to flood.</p>

<p>A livid glare fell over the shimmering waves, and lit upwards, as
if by reflection those huge monstrous shapes of tossing clouds with a
metal--like lustre, as if they had been copper and bronze sheets
shattered by artillery. This voiceless motion of the heavens, out of
all unison with the deadly quiet of the vegetable world and the
lifeless stillness of the deserted huts, touched, as with a chilly
hand, the hearts of those who watched the turmoil above and heard
with painful distinctness the low mutterings of the three priests at
that primitive altar.</p>

<p>"We must rush at once for cover," cried the priest, coming to the
door and locking it quickly as he saw the rapid weather-changes. "We
are not safe here if the tribes re-form and occupy their villages in
front. Come, I will lead you a short cut."</p>

<p>No sound as yet from the coming storm as they started at a run
along the grey beach and through the black jungle, only a few
disturbed cockatoos, who rose chattering from their roost to seek a
more distant shelter. Helter-skelter all went through the grass
again, tumbling over one another, yet guided by the sounds in front;
they had about a mile to get over before they could get free from
those stinging, twining reeds, and in their hurry they no longer took
note of outside sounds, while the darkness gathered down like a black
tissue, fold upon fold, with appalling rapidity.</p>

<p>Out, at last, to the open, where they can see the little
mission-station upon the promontory, with the sky behind showing
ghastly illumined, reflected clouds on a cold steel background, with
a dusky blackness over against them in the west. The house and
outstanding huts startlingly silhouetted against those electric and
brilliant, but light-absorbing, rolling mountains of clouds. Out at
last, with panting chests and steaming bodies, for the heat is
terrific, and the travellers are as thoroughly drenched with
perspiration as if they had plunged through a river.</p>

<p>"Let us rest for a moment," panted Bowman and Danby with one
breath, while the burly old captain, rolling heavily through the
brakes, tripped over a stump and fell, without an effort to rise
again--too much exhausted even to blaspheme.</p>

<p>Father Ambrose turned with parted lips to take a handkerchief from
his pocket with his usual quietness, while his companions leaned
without speaking upon the barrels of their rusty fowling-pieces,
passing at intervals their shrunken hands over their brows and
scattering the thickly-gathering beads of sweat as they started
out.</p>

<p>"This is very good for us after the fever," observed the priest,
when he had recovered his voice, "we do not often get such a
bath."</p>

<p>"That may be," grunted out the prostrate captain huskily, "but I'm
d----blowed if it seems good for me."</p>

<p>"Yes, you do look considerably blowed at present, commodore,"
responded the ever-ready Danby, who, being the slenderest of the
company, had soonest recovered. "But if you don't want to be drowned
as well as blowed, I think you had best be shifting your camp."</p>

<p>A blaze of wild-fire broke from the ghostly mass behind the
mission--house as Danby spoke, and seemed to envelop it and lick it
out of sight as it brought out objects with deadly precision near at
hand, lighting up the Frenchman's clear features and the swollen
visage of the horrified skipper at his feet, who greeted it with a
more than ordinary shriek of fear or agony.</p>

<p>The blaze, though not lasting more than a second, permitted them
to see besides the forms of friends, even the most minute details,
and even the individual blades of reeds; it also showed them the dark
faces and mop-like heads of over a score of antagonists with
up-lifted spears; and then it was darkness more intense than ever,
while the captain's shrill yell of pain mingled with their fierce
yelling of vengeance.</p>

<p>"Are you wounded, friend?" anxiously asked the priest, stooping
down; while flash, flash, from two barrels, with following reports,
mixed up the cries.</p>

<p>"Yes," groaned the poor skipper, rolling about in the darkness,
and uttering oaths while he did so.</p>

<p>"Keep silent, friends, and move out quickly; let us get to the
house if we can. Let me lift you up, my poor friend."</p>

<p>After much wriggling about and vain groping, the captain was got
up; and, between Bowman and the priest, urged up the hill, even while
the downpour of rain came upon them without seemingly the customary
few large drops which act as the prelude to tropic showers.</p>

<p>Were they a group of spectres which that flash had revealed, or
were the yells imaginary? Nothing seemed to follow those two revolver
reports as they dashed up the steep, slipping sides of the mound
through that deluge, or they were all in too great a state of
excitement to pay attention to any outside sound in their frantic
desire to get under cover. There was no time to know who followed,
and they could not see one another, or know whether it was a friend
or an enemy which they struck against as they slid backwards; and not
until they were inside the house with the door barred could they
pause to find out whether they were all there or not.</p>

<p>Courage is a splendid quality, and easy to practise in theory;
even in daylight it is not so difficult to brace up to an emergency,
but in such a sightless darkness it becomes like the weight of a
nightmare; to fly is the first impulse then from the evil which we
cannot see. A fight in the dark is decidedly demoralizing.</p>

<p>They had all run recklessly, even the wounded captain after the
first start required little urging on; it was a regular stampede,
with the feeling in each back as we used to feel as boys, when
running down a dark stair. Perhaps two minutes elapsed between the
first flash at the foot of the hill and the next flash, as the priest
was fumbling about to get his matchbox inside the mission-house, yet
what an eternity of horrors for all.</p>

<p>Possibly the sudden blaze of wild-fire which revealed each party
to the other had done more to frighten away the natives than the
aimless shots from the revolvers, for beside heaven's ordnance man's
paltry fireworks are less than farthing rushlights beside electric
flames. When the matches had been found and ignited and the candle
set alight, it revealed the company intact, and not any further sign
of disturbance outside than the rushing of waters from roof and
sky.</p>

<p>The first thought of the hosts, after looking after the fastening
of doors and windows, was to see to the injuries sustained by the
captain, who now squatted on the floor with rather a perplexed and
uneasy expression on his burly features.</p>

<p>"Where were you wounded, my friend?" asked the priest, bending
tenderly over him.</p>

<p>"That is just what I cannot tell you, for I don't know myself now,
that rush up the hill seems to have driven out all recollection from
me."</p>

<p>"Ah!" the priest smiled, "then it is not so serious as I
thought."</p>

<p>Captain MacAndrews ruefully scratched his Achilles-like head and
looked over to where his tormentor Danby stood, but that young
gentleman was too seriously engaged in attending to his own comfort
to pay much heed to anything else. He, with Bowman, had taken off
their shirts, and were hard at work wringing out much of the
moisture; his roasting might come later, but at present he was safe,
so in a surly fashion he slowly began to exert himself and follow
their wise example, while the three missionaries, without heeding
their own dripping garments, set about the task of making their
guests comfortable by lighting a fire and bringing out the cognac,
both of which were eagerly greeted by all now that the rain had
cooled the air, and their drenching inwardly and outwardly made them
the more susceptible to the change.</p>

<p>A little quinine, about the proportion of six grains to each, was
also accepted as a preventive against this fever, which is so
insidious in its approach and so easy to get, particularly in such
condition as they all were then; after this they could afford to look
about them and talk.</p>

<p>If the Europeans could go about, like the natives, in the dress
which nature alone provides, I doubt if there would be many cases of
fever in tropical countries, a waistband, which protects the liver
and kidneys, being all that is required by way of covering; for it is
the chill which comes on by the contact of damp clothes, and clothes
are always wet in countries where the least exertion causes the
moisture to start out in dense beads on every portion of the body,
wherein the danger lies, and to this may be attributed the dying out
of native tribes who come into contact with the white men and ape
their customs, even more than to the fire-water that they
introduce.</p>

<p>"I could have sworn I was wounded somewhere when that flash o'
lightning showed me up the niggers with their spears, but where it
can be I have no more notion than Moses."</p>

<p>Thus muttered the honest if imaginative skipper, as he turned his
wet shirt about before wringing it like the others, preparatory to
drying it at the now blazing log fire. A picturesque group of
half-naked albinoes they looked as they held their sole upper
garments to the flames. The three missionaries had proffered them a
change; but in the tropics to go without clothes for a while, is not
much of a hardship, so, as they were anxious to get once more on
board, they preferred to stand as they were and wait on the drying,
particularly as they knew to borrow a change meant depriving the
Fathers of their own comfort, as the clergymen were all too modest to
bare themselves before their visitors--a feeling of shyness the
others did not experience for a second. Instead then of accepting the
too generous offer, they all united in persuading the Fathers to
retire and guard themselves from a relapse of the dreaded malaria not
yet out of their systems.</p>

<p>Silence outside still, with a most refreshing sense of coolness,
for now that the rain had ceased to pour with the same abruptness
with which it began, the suffocating heat had been succeeded by the
grateful freshness which rain-soaked soil ever produces.</p>

<p>The mosquitoes also swarmed in countless hordes, ravenous and
large, with sonorous trumpets--from the damp mangroves they came,
where they are bred, to the exposed white men, whom, no doubt, they
scented for miles away. They were not so numerous as they had been,
the good Frenchman mentioned while setting the supper dishes.</p>

<p>"Then I don't wonder that you look thin," answered Bowman,
stifling about a myriad of them with the volume of smoke he puffed
from his lips against the phalanx as he spoke. "We are pretty well
used to mosquitoes in Thursday Island, but you beat us hollow with
your Yule Island fellows, Father."</p>

<p>"Yes, they are very strong, and assertive of their own notions of
right of way," replied the missionary, pouring into a tin flat dish
stew made from preserved mutton, yams, and onions, with a few of the
native herbs, which now filled the room with a most appetizing
odour.</p>

<p>"I guess it was one of those tiger-fellows who progged you with
his proboscis, captain, when you thought you were wounded with the
spear to-night; they are always worse close to the ground."</p>

<p>Captain MacAndrews pretended not to hear this sally of the
ever--buoyant Danby.</p>

<p>"By the way, have you found the locality of that hurt yet?"</p>

<p>"If you don't shut up, perhaps you'll know where your hurt is
presently, youngster," growled the skipper, angrily.</p>

<p>"Let us sit, gentlemen, while it is warm," observed the pacific
priest, anxious to prevent a scene.</p>

<p>"By Jove, it smells delicious," cried Bowman, sniffing up the
aroma with great gusto.</p>

<p>"We French are all cooks, as you know," replied the priest, "if we
have anything to cook."</p>

<p>"How do you manage?"</p>

<p>"It is an instinct, like painting or poetry, and when it guides
you rightly the result is always satisfactory. Already we have begun
to grow our own onions, and in another year, if spared, we expect to
glean a splendid harvest. With a very small piece of beef or mutton,
and what we can pick up in the fields, it is not difficult to make a
simple dish, though we sometimes run short of salt, and we find it
difficult to overcome that necessity; yet I venture to assert that
any one may become a fair cook who will condescend to devote as much
attention to his pot as he might do over any other composition, for
it is in the firing chiefly that the dish is spoilt and the flavour
lost. The pan, when once on the fire, should not be lost sight of for
a single second, while the fire for stews and dishes of that
description cannot be too fierce; indeed, I may say that when I am
cooking a dish I have no time even for prayer until it is dished,
which reminds us, gentlemen, to thank God now for the supper which He
has been good enough to permit us to live to cook, and, I trust, all
enjoy."</p>

<p>The missionary, as he said this, bent his head in silence, leaving
them each to offer their thanks as they felt inclined, according to
their own views on this subject, after which they all fell to with
that avidity which hungry men can, and very soon showed their
appreciation of his culinary skill by leaving clean platters.</p>

<p>"You will stay to-night with me, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"Not unless you dread an attack, Father."</p>

<p>"Not for my sake would I ask you to stay, but for your own. They
will not harm us; indeed, I expect it was owing to their uncertainty
in the darkness as to whom they might strike which prevented them
flinging their spears to-night."</p>

<p>"Then we must go very soon, as our men must be warned, otherwise
the steamer may be in danger from the canoes."</p>

<p>"Very true; then we will go at once."</p>

<p>"You are not coming, Father, surely?"</p>

<p>"Surely I shall come and see you safely from our island. We shall
take lanterns so that they will know we are with you, and since you
will not be my guests I shall be yours to-night, and to-morrow will
be able to quiet their suspicions. I pray to God that you may not
have shot any one to-night."</p>

<p>"I think not," responded Bowman, "I aimed over their heads."</p>

<p>"And I couldn't have hit them, however much I tried," added Danby.
"It isn't in me to hit anything less than an elephant, and then only
if he balanced the barrel with his tusks."</p>

<p>"Then all will be well," replied the priest. "Let us go, if you
are ready."</p>

<p>"Quite ready." And looking once more to their weapons, withdrawing
the cartridges already in and putting in fresh ones, they all
prepared once more to go into the risky darkness.</p>

<p>The two assistant priests went out first, and shortly returned,
reporting all as quiet. When the party reached the mound, they could
see over by the villages the dusky reflection amongst the deep
midnight space which betokened large fires burning on the beach.</p>

<p>"I think all is well," muttered Father Ambrose, "but we will walk
as quietly as possible with our lamps shining toward the sea. Antone
will walk behind with his light covered, but ready for use if
anything suspicious occurs, while I will go a little way ahead; but,
gentlemen, don't use your pistols, unless at the last emergency.
Remember that life is as precious to savage as to Christian."</p>

<p>No more words passed as they went in single file down through the
fields and into the mangrove thicket, where they had left their
dingey in the afternoon. Pedro, the second assistant, followed after
the leader, with Bowman next, and the captain in the centre, much
against his will, since he had Danby behind him, who at intervals
made him leap with a prick in the ribs when least expected, forcing
him at the same time to smother the exclamation of horror as he
fancied each touch to be a native spear. The method of silencing him
he adopted was to put his hand suddenly over his mouth and whisper in
his ear, "Hush, for God's sake! do you hear nothing?" A momentous
march without incident, except these torturing moments for the poor
unwieldy old skipper, who rolled along with ice--cold drops dripping
down his back, and a blending of impotent rage and fear choking him,
while his tormentor never ceased his game until at the water's edge,
when, by an adroit push, he sent him into the water, and afterwards
added to his injuries the worse one of pretending to have saved his
life by lugging him out again all dripping, like a Newfoundland
dog.</p>

<p>"Sharks bad hereabouts I should say, Father?" asked Danby
innocently, as he took his place behind the poor old captain.</p>

<p>"Yes, they are," replied Father Vincent, taking his seat.</p>

<p>"Another narrow squeak, for you, admiral. I expect a bottle of
whisky at the least out of you for this last good action."</p>

<p>"You'll get it, too, my boy," responded the captain, fervently,
taking an oar and pushing the dingey from the rocks. "Thank God,
that's the last of Yule Island for me!--a regular nest of
pirates."</p>

<h3>Chapter XXIV. Toto as a Defender.</h3>

<p>SOMETIMES about the very worst luck which can befall a man is to
gain an advantage over his adversary.</p>

<p>Our feelings may be outraged, or our contempt and indignation
roused, until we rise up in our righteous wrath and strike out from
the shoulder, and what is the result?--satisfaction? Yes, a brief
instant of satisfaction, trailing behind it years of regret. We prate
of our wrongs and no one listens, or if they do, it is only in order
to mock us, or else betray us when our backs are turned. We avenge
our injuries, and straightway rises up from the deed, misery or
self-contempt in our hearts; the object of our wrath is invested with
a halo of pathetic reproach the instant our stroke of justice has
descended, because our humanity prevents us from being implacable, as
stern justice must be; or else the object is too insignificant for
the blow we have given to it, and so the blow recoils directly with
double force upon our own heads.</p>

<p>Again, no injury can be repaired by the injurer, repentance will
not do it; no ocean of tears can ever wipe out the damaged spot; we
are haunted for ever by another ghost who joins a vast regiment, the
ghastly army of deeds, to chase us through life; it is much easier,
in reality, to bear a blow of adversity than to have become the cause
of another's ruin.</p>

<p>Kamo, for a moment or two, as he stalked away with much majesty
into the deep shadows past the tamarind-tree, felt very well
satisfied with his promptitude and brave display of courage; so,
also, did Rea, when she beheld her splendid young hero, with the
firelight playing over his satin-like limbs, so easily overthrow and
make ridiculous this very contemptible pretender to her hand; but I
doubt if either of this foolish self-congratulatory young couple felt
half the satisfaction that Toto did, as he picked himself up and
adjusted his raumma about this same very ridiculous part which he had
been brought to play in the magic ceremony.</p>

<p>A thorough philosopher, he cared no more about a kick, unless when
it hurt very much, than he did about any other insult, so long as it
touched no more than his honour. This kick had not hurt him beyond a
passing sting, whereas it placed his enemy in his merciless grasp,
for by that interruption in this sacred ceremony, Kamo had broken
tapu, the punishment of which was death, unless the one injured chose
to interfere, the punishment and mode being entirely at his
option.</p>

<p>A magnificent kick for fortune-favoured Toto, who showed his ugly
fangs in a more decided leer than ever as he looked towards the still
animated countenance of Rea, while he turned with a hypocritical air
of pity towards where the father, mother, and sisters stood,
paralyzed with horror at the madness of their audacious and
irreligious son and brother.</p>

<p>Half a dozen steps into the blackness of the croton shadows and
the truth burst upon him with the suddenness of the doom of Cain.</p>

<p>"Lost, lost for ever! oh, fool! fool!! fool!!!" and, with a howl
like a wild beast, he plunged his hand into his carefully-frizzed,
orange-dyed hair, tearing out handfuls, as he fled frantically
towards the mountains.</p>

<p>Rea woke up next to the utter helplessness of her position, the
folly of her budding hopes, the destruction of her love. Not a child
of the company who could speak at all but knew what Kamo's kick meant
inside that circle sanctified by the sacred spell of the
spirit-seers, or that until his or other blood washed away the evil
luck, nothing but misfortune would come to the tribe. Kamo was doomed
without a chance, for what pity could any one expect from laughing
Toto; and as this truth broke upon her, she laid her poor head right
amongst the sand and ashes, and wept as if her little heart would
have burst.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the present personal safety of Kamo, the New
Guinea native will not move in any matter without a great amount of
discussion and tall talking, and it takes them, as a rule, like all
livers in the open air, some little time to grasp a situation,
otherwise the offender might have been at once secured, instead of
being permitted to stalk away as he had done in full presence of the
outraged assembled tribe, driving, as it were, the affronted
prophetic spirits sheer out of the field.</p>

<p>But now that the ghost performance was over for the present
occasion, the next thing to do was to dismiss the women to bed, while
the men assembled in the Dobu, or grand house of the village, to
discuss the grave question, and pass judgment upon the culprit;
therefore, the chief and father of Rea, Mavaraiko, gravely rising up,
gave what might be termed the benediction to that meeting. At this
potent signal of dismissal, against which there could be no protest,
much as the women were listened to generally, Putitai, the unmarried
sister of Kamo, and friend to Rea, passed over, and lifting up the
afflicted girl, led her away to her father's hut.</p>

<p>Meantime a guard of the youngest men left amongst them was hastily
extemporized and ordered to prowl round the outskirts of the village,
and watch in case of invasion from their old enemies the mountain
tribes, from whom vague rumours had floated of a contemplated raid.
This, indeed, had been one of the reasons why the present
spirit-meeting had been convened, and now that the spirits had been
driven off before they had time to come to this important portion of
their warning, these simple children of nature expected nothing less
than an immediate assault, all the greater reason for execrating the
impious name of Kamo.</p>

<p>Large fires were speedily lighted up at different portions of the
village, and one in front of the Dobu, until the whole place stood
out in glaring relief in the midst of the general darkness of the
forest, while the women concealed themselves inside their houses, and
peered out with large frightened eyes from between the crevices at
the hurrying figures of their lords and masters, as they hastily
armed themselves and gathered before the platform upon which
Mavaraiko stood leaning upon a large black palm spear, with his
shield-bearer by his side, and the spirit professor behind him;
where, also, the injured Toto had been promoted, now once more
adorned with his yellow and red-spotted pijamas, with his broad straw
hat tilted over his left ear, in all the grandeur of his civilized
garb, the personation of triumphant innocence.</p>

<p>The Dubo House stood in the centre of the village, and was the
only house dignified with a spire, which rose to a height of about
sixty feet, with projecting poles of bamboo with fluttering grasses
and palm--ribbons. The first floor was raised about six feet from the
sand on many strong cotton and gum-tree posts, with a wide strong
platform of tough undressed logs overlaid with coarse planks; how
they ever managed to cut those planks being one of the wonders of
their native ironless craft.</p>

<p>Above this platform, at about eight feet, another projected,
forming a second flat and a verandah-like roof for the first
platform, to reach both of which rude moveable ladders were placed
against the posts; this verandah was fringed, as were the eaves of
the palm-thatched roof, with bleached skulls and other human remains,
sombre relics of departed friends and murdered enemies; tame
cockatoos and parrots swung themselves by day upon these ghastly
trophies, and roosted upon them at night.</p>

<p>Inside all was in deepest shadow, one large under-chamber, with
the walls lined with weapons of warfare, and a small upper chamber,
with funnel-like roof, reaching to the height of the spire.</p>

<p>Outside, where the male portion of the assembly were squatting or
standing according to pleasure while waiting on the chief to open
parliament, wandered droves of pet pigs with preternaturally long
snouts, rubbing up against naked legs to attract notice or get
scratched by their fond owners, grunting with delight, or breaking
the silence with shrill squeaks, as the likewise limitless cluster of
native dogs jealously snapped at their wriggling tails when they saw
that the pigs were more taken notice of than themselves.</p>

<p>The leaping flames from the different fires mixed up the lights
most fantastically, and threw black shadows, which seemed strangely
animated, into the open space within the assembled motionless circle
and up the knarled supports of the platform, so that the shadows
seemed to be alive, and the waiting warriors to be carven fiends
only; a weird and vivid golden effect of light burnished up the whole
village, and to ships passing outside the barrier reef, far in the
gulf, must have seemed ominous in the extreme in a land where fires
of this extent denote carnage, intensified in horror by the awful
after-effects of cannibalism.</p>

<p>A short pause after the crowd had settled themselves and then
Mavaraiko opened the debate with the usual highly-coloured eloquence
of the savage, be he white or copper-tinted, who only recognizes the
laws of self-gratification and the lust of revenge.</p>

<p>He biased the court with his first words like a modern magistrate,
and carried on in the same vein to the finale, demanding the one
punishment--"death," which was recognized by his hearers as the
punishment for almost every offence, great or trivial; in the code of
the savage there are no gradations in crime, except in the case of
theft, which is venal, and to be condoned by restitution.</p>

<p>Kamo's crime was of greater magnitude than a single murder, for by
this act of interruption he was regarded as endangering the lives of
all his friends and relations; even his father could say nothing by
way of extenuation; he must be slain by all the laws of procedure,
and Toto should have the right of being avenger.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that Toto shone forth with extraordinary
brilliancy, and proved the benefit which he had received from his
communication with the civilized races. Rising gracefully to his
feet, he silenced, with a gentle and oratorical wave of his hand, the
very hubbub of tongues which had now broken loose, and when peace was
once more restored, addressed them as follows:--</p>

<p>"My friends and supporters, you all know me as well as I do
myself, and what I have done for you since I was born. You know that
I have brought much property amongst you, and made you all so greatly
respected by other tribes by being so very rich; our Kavana is the
great man, but am I not the rich one?"</p>

<p>Yells of applause and cries from one and all that he was, but a
slightly lowering expression on the heavy brows of Mavaraiko gathered
instantly, noticing which the adroit orator resumed.</p>

<p>"But what is property compared to great deeds and noble birth; is
not our Kavana a mighty man?"</p>

<p>Signs of clearing up of the noble visage.</p>

<p>"What have I done in all my life compared to one of his fighting
days? Who has done more to fill up the line of skulls which now
fringe our Dobu roof?"</p>

<p>Toto pointed above him, while the chief gently patted him on the
shoulder--</p>

<p>"You are a good boy, Toto, and are my son."</p>

<p>"You all hear what our father has to-night promised me," cried
Toto, exultantly.</p>

<p>"You shall have my daughter Rea, directly you bring me the head of
Kamo to hang up on that empty place."</p>

<p>The slobbing under-lip of Toto fell limply at this condition, but
recovering himself he continued,--</p>

<p>"You all know how I love Rea, and also that her little heart has
gone out for the present after that wicked Kamo. If I kill him, will
she not hate me for ever after, and who would marry a woman to be
hated?"</p>

<p>Toto paused to watch the effect of his wily suggestions, but saw
only contemptuous shrugs of the shoulders from his hearers; his
reasons were too fine drawn for their broad comprehensions, observing
which, he hastily continued in a vaunting tone,--</p>

<p>"I do not fear Kamo, for I know how to kill with the white man's
tube, but I want the heart of Rea, and this is the way I am going to
get it. I would spare the life of Kamo, and only banish him from the
tribe, which, if he ever comes near again, then I will take my
man-trap and slay him, without mercy."</p>

<p>The broken-hearted father of Kamo here sprang up to the platform,
and with his two arms embraced the pijama-covered limbs of the
merciful Toto in an cestasy of gratitude.</p>

<p>"You all see how I have pleased the father, will it not also
please my wife when she hears of it?"</p>

<p>Signs of bewilderment in the audience; perhaps after all, the rich
Toto was a better fellow than they had hitherto considered him to be.
He went on more loudly than ever,--</p>

<p>"The white man taught me to be merciful when my enemy is in my
power, but I can be brave also, as you will find when the time comes.
Place me in the front when the common enemy comes, and you shall see
how I can fight--"</p>

<p>At this moment there seemed to be a wild commotion from the
outskirts of the village, which made the brave man pause in his
boasting and look anxiously over the heads of his audience. The next
instant three of the young men sent as sentinels, were seen to burst
through the undergrowth with great force, and rush towards them with
loud cries.</p>

<p>"Quick! to arms, the enemy is upon us."</p>

<p>As the men leaped to their feet with one impulse, and Mavaraiko
vaulted amongst them from his lofty position, the brave defender,
Toto, rolled backwards along the platform, like an highly-coloured
india--rubber ball, and vanished into the dark shadows of the huts
nearest the sea.</p>

<h3>Chapter XXV. Kamo to the Fore.</h3>

<p>THROUGH the forest, towards the mountain, rushed Kamo, blind to
everything except his own utter misery. Tumbling over twigs and
fallen limbs of dead trees, mile after mile he ran on, until at last
Nature triumphed over misery, and he sank exhausted at the foot of a
gigantic tamarind.</p>

<p>He had gone in a direct line instinctively, taking the native
track to the interior, and where he now lay panting, he was nearly
midway between his own village and the village with which they were
at enmity, much nearer than he would have dared to venture by day,
alone and unarmed as he was.</p>

<p>Of course he knew every mile of the way, and with the sure
instinct of the savage, discovered his locality, as soon as his first
giddiness of exhaustion had passed; then, with the same instinct,
caution commenced to assert itself in his breast, and he began to
consider his position, and think if there could be any way out of it,
anything he could do to repair his mistake and regain his place with
his tribe.</p>

<p>Yes! it was a desperate plan, but he was in a desperate
plight--blood alone could wash out his iniquity, and raise him in the
estimation of his people. If he could, unarmed, take a life or two,
and bring back some heads, then he would become a real hero, and they
would forgive him, and he would once more work his way in with
Mavaraiko and regain his love.</p>

<p>He would do it, or die in the attempt; to go back empty-handed
meant a death as cruel as the death in front, to steal forward might
mean life and love, and could at the worst only be death.</p>

<p>Extremity is the finest goad to exertion.</p>

<p>Motionlessly he now listened before he rose up, then hearing all
the forest seemingly deserted, he stole, with careful feet, onwards
towards the mountain village.</p>

<p>The upper foliage was too dense for any moonlight to penetrate,
and from bush to bush he managed to glide and hide without a chance
of being seen, and only the faintest chance of being heard when a
twig crackled under his feet.</p>

<p>A deadly quiet walk through an almost Egyptian darkness, with
barriers checking him, and tendrils clinging about him at every step,
through a lavish labyrinth of flowers, leaves and creepers, such as
only a savage could find or force a passage without waking the
surrounding echoes of the night.</p>

<p>"Hark!" what was that?</p>

<p>Kamo dissolved into the intricacies of an evergreen, without
seemingly disturbing a leaf, and listened with starting eyes to the
sound in front.</p>

<p>Nothing to break the repose of the windless forest to any ears,
save those of an untamed son of Nature, but enough to signify to him
that a body of natives were gliding towards him, with just a little
less than their usual caution, for they were still too far off their
goal to care how they trod.</p>

<p>On the war-trail, for their spears were disturbing the leaves as
they passed by his lair, and he could hear the rubbing of their
poisoned arrows against their shields at times.</p>

<p>Up to two hundred Kamo counted as they glided past him in single
file, without a word, for it is unlucky to break silence when going
to the hunt. A mighty raid they intended with that number, and going
towards his tribe.</p>

<p>It meant extermination, for they had not more than sixty fighting
men ready if not warned; bad enough even then.</p>

<p>Was he yet destined to retrieve his fault by a mighty deed which
would save his tribe? If not, he could die for and with them.</p>

<p>Out of the shrubby ambush, as the last man passed, Kamo glided,
without any plan, only determined to follow and take his chance.</p>

<p>Two hundred and one men are now upon the war-path, walking single
file; but the second last man has no suspicion that there is another
behind.</p>

<p>The warrior last but one is the youngest man of the tribe; he is
now going on his first raid with his full accoutrements on; indeed,
an extra supply of everything, as young men will begin life with when
they can.</p>

<p>Has he tripped over a stone and fallen? It must be so, for he
makes no sign to the one in front, so that he doesn't wait on him,
but glides along, leaving the young brave to come up when he rises. A
moment more and he rejoins the man in front, gliding on
voiceless.</p>

<p>Pitch darkness in the forest where they walk, with a headless body
lying bleeding in the forest, which that chance fall had given to
Kamo, his first head, which now dangles at his waist-belt, the warm
fluid running down his left leg, and growing chilly in the night
air.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" a heavy breath from the next man as Kamo piths him from
behind with the sharp bone-blade which the headless youth supplied
him with, and he too is laid noiselessly in the path with a split
heart. There is no time to take this head, but he can find it if he
ever comes back that way. There are now only one hundred and
ninety-eight, with one enemy, on the war-trail now.</p>

<p>A game of treachery? Yes, an all-round New Guinea game, like the
one Judith played to save her people.</p>

<p>On, on through the darkness, while the men in front get angry at
the want of caution from those behind; they will gasp now and again
where there is no need, but as yet no one has actually broken the
strictly--observed silence, only the last man but one did not die
instantly, and Kamo had to hold his mouth with all his might while he
felt about for the heart. This made the twigs under foot to break too
loudly, and much disturbed and annoyed the chief in front; but now
they are going on all right, and have got within about a mile of the
village doomed to destruction.</p>

<p>Kamo has succeeded beyond his desires; twenty men lie bleeding on
the war-path out of that two hundred, and four of them are without
their heads, a heavy load for Kamo to carry from his waist-belt; but
he will be honoured now even if he dies.</p>

<p>Half a mile and the glare from the fires begin to dart between the
leaves and light up little projections like fire-flies. Kamo now
knows that his friends are partly prepared, and makes up his mind to
go. There is a side cutting which he knows, and which only lately has
been cleared, close at hand; this will lead him quicker to the
village, if the light doesn't stream through it, and betray it to the
enemy.</p>

<p>The fire-fly flashes have now taken on the proportion and colour
of butterflies in the full sun. A few more yards and they will see
one another distinctly. Now is the time. They have passed the lane
which is faithful in its darkness, and offers the retreat after he
has potted his twenty-first man. No need for caution now; it must be
a race for life.</p>

<p>Kamo hangs back a moment in deep shadow, so as to get better
purchase with his borrowed man trap, which he dare not use before in
case he missed,--just a moment while the warrior in front plunges
past a bar of fire-light which crosses the foot-path. They are near
to the village gardens, and with a few more steps they will be full
in the light of the thinning forest-trees.</p>

<p>"Whish!" the bamboo man-trap, with its pithing spear, is over the
warrior's head, and catches him under the chin, jerking the spinal
column full against the prong, then, with a yell of triumph, Kamo let
go the handle and bounds backwards into the deep shelter of that
trusty cutting.</p>

<h3>Chapter XXVI. A Night Raid.</h3>

<p>DISCOVERED! With their intended victims in front and behind. How
many? Ah! the inability to answer this question in a moment of
uncertainty is how a hundred armies have been conquered before now,
and battles lost.</p>

<p>Kamo rushed down that lane with the rapidity of a racehorse, and
would have been the first to give the warning to his friends had the
road been clear, for the hundred and seventy-nine men paused
irresolute in the forest as they heard the death shriek of their
comrade, mixed with that wild yell, which gave the alarm to the
sentinels in front, not knowing whether to turn back or advance; but,
unfortunately for his project, there stood another guard about the
middle of the path, against whom Kamo came with such velocity that
they were both spun different ways, and for a moment were completely
dazed with the collision.</p>

<p>The guard, being a much more solidly built man than Kamo, was the
first to recover wind, and when he did, without a moment longer
pausing to consider matters, he plunged straight in the direction of
his prostrate enemy, knife in hand, to finish up his advantage.</p>

<p>The darkness, which had befriended before it be trayed the youth,
once more acted on his side, for, as the other lunged wildly forward,
striking at random, Kamo also slowly recovering, by chance caught at
the arm, and so together they closed with one another in a most
desperate and silent hand-to-hand tussle.</p>

<p>Kamo felt he was in the furious grasp of an ignorant friend, much
more powerful than himself, and tried with all his might to make him
aware of the mistake he was labouring under, but without succeeding;
as it required all his waning strength and breath to hold him back
for the first few moments.</p>

<p>At last, when the issue was no longer doubtful, he managed, with
the knife almost at his throat, to gasp out,--</p>

<p>"Don't kill me--Kamo!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" the other relaxed his embrace just in time.</p>

<p>"The enemy is behind!" panted the exhausted youth, huskily. "To
the village and warn them, I will come when I can."</p>

<p>"How many?"</p>

<p>"One hundred and--"</p>

<p>It was no time to explain matters further. Up leapt the savage,
and away as the words were passing Kamo's dry throat, leaving him to
pick himself up as best he could, and follow with his news.</p>

<p>So it chanced that the three sentinels broke from their cover
simultaneously at the moment when Toto demanded an opportunity of
proving his valour as the defender of his country, while poor Kamo
once more lost his chance of distinguishing himself, for the present
at any rate, by telling of his single-handed action.</p>

<p>Mavaraiko, an old and tried warrior, at once drew his men into the
shadow side of the Dubo, where he promptly questioned the
outposts.</p>

<p>The two first could only speak of their alarm at the yell and
death--shriek, so the third had it his own way. He briefly recounted
his contact and struggle with Kamo.</p>

<p>"How many did the boy say?" asked the chief.</p>

<p>"One hundred, oh Kavana!" answered the sentinel promptly.</p>

<p>It was as well for the pluck of the invaded that Kamo had not been
permitted to finish his sentence.</p>

<p>"And we are sixty, counting the old men!" muttered the chief. "But
where are they that they do not come?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps they do not know our force, and the fires have frightened
them," replied Ila, the old father of Kamo.</p>

<p>"That must be it," said the chief, pondering deeply for a moment,
while his followers watched the thicket with anxious eyes.</p>

<p>"We will beat them, and get many heads, for they must be afraid.
Ila go round the huts and raise the women, they must help us, this
must help us to-night; give them drums and the war-horns, and take
four men and ten women round by the east end of the forest. Kupa,
take the same number and go by the west; when you get equal distances
from each other, and when you think you are behind them, make the
women beat upon their drums and blow their horns, that will cause
them to think our allies are joining us. Take only the young women,
for they can blow hard on the conch shells, and see that Rea is of
the number chosen. You, Heni, are old, and can be spared
tonight;--gather the old women together on to the beach, and take all
the canoes, put them in, and let them go half a mile from the shore,
when that distance make all the noise you can, they will by that
means think the Kerepuni men are coming to help us,--go quickly."</p>

<p>The three men glided off like shadows without reply.</p>

<p>"Toto!"</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>"Where is Toto?"</p>

<p>Ay, where was the gallant Toto, now that the moment of action had
arrived?</p>

<p>One of the spectators at last replied how he had seen the defender
roll off the platform. A general grim laugh followed this
revelation.</p>

<p>"No matter," replied the chief, "we can do without him; I never
saw him fight, yet ye know what Kamo can do, and I wish he was with
us."</p>

<p>"Kamo is here, oh Kavana," replied that youth with becoming
modesty, rising up from the shadows beside the chief.</p>

<p>"Welcome, my son, as you fight to-night, so will we judge your
fault to-morrow, but what have you got there?"</p>

<p>One of the heads had touched against the nude skin of Mavaraiko,
as Kamo rubbed against him.</p>

<p>"Four heads for the Dubo house," replied Kamo, pitching them down
so that they rolled a little way into the fire-glare.</p>

<p>"Good boy, you are a warrior, and have already wiped away your bad
luck; how many have you killed?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-one dead men lie on the mountain-track, whom I have killed
to-night."</p>

<p>Exclamations of wonder and delight broke from the assembled men
when Kamo told his adventures, while the chief by a low whisper
stopped him when he was about to tell of the number left.</p>

<p>"Hush, Kamo, how many?"</p>

<p>"Two hundred went before me, oh Kavana," whispered Kamo back
again; "one hundred and seventy-nine are waiting in the forest close
to the gardens."</p>

<p>"Do not speak of it, my son," replied the chief in a low voice,
and then raising his tones, he said,--</p>

<p>"Kamo is a boy, and has slain twenty-one men; he went to meet them
without a weapon, and comes back armed with spears; we must do no
less, for we are men and have our spears; come, my braves, we will
meet them in the forest and drive them into the light where we can
kill them as we like;--guide us, Kamo, to where they are."</p>

<p>Along the shadows, behind the houses, they all crept towards the
cutting, leaving the fire burning brightly in the deserted village,
with only the pigs to look after them, for the dogs, accustomed to
the hunt, went with their masters.</p>

<p>Meantime the one hundred and seventy-nine mountain men were still
in about the same place as Kamo had left them, the silence around
them being profound, and therefore, as they felt from experience,
pregnant of treachery. The fires glittered through the intersections
of palm fronds, palisades and forest leaves, and flickered upon odd
portions of their bodies as they instinctively gathered closely about
their chief, weapons in grasp, all ready for the sudden surprise,
which they had come prepared to give, but now expected to receive
instead.</p>

<p>Was the enemy behind, in front, or had the allies joined and
surrounded them, luring them into a trap and cutting off their
retreat? No man dared to move or speak as they stood and listened
intently.</p>

<p>The chief himself was at a loss--he was old and not so quick
either with his hand or his brain--and so he only stood, helpless,
waiting upon the inspiration which would not come.</p>

<p>Now, also, for the first time, they missed their twenty-one
companions, at least, the twenty, for the last man slain lay a few
yards away, with the man-trap still about his neck, the cane handle
bent and twisted under him where he had fallen backwards upon it, and
that broad bar of fire-light dancing slant-ways over his body, and
gleaming upon the under half of one cheek, and this sight before
their eyes, with the mysterious disappearance of the other twenty
men, filled each breast with anticipated horror and superstitious
chills, which seemed to freeze up their hearts, and pluck the courage
from them, and the strength from their arms, their muscles seemed
paralyzed, and their brains to be benumbed.</p>

<p>Time passed on without a change in their position--quarter of an
hour, half an hour, still that appalling silence of treachery around,
the uncertain flickering and dancing of those dusky lights,
fluttering like bronze-winged butterflies amongst the black shadows.
That single bar of copper glow, moving and shifting slant-ways over
the dead body so near to them, with the motion which a sleeper's
breathing causes, and at times darting from the under part of the
cheek to the one glistening, protruding eye, with a red sparkle,
horrible to look at.</p>

<p>"Ha! they are behind us," cried the chief at last, as the faint
wind, breathing westward, bore the first distant blast of the conch
shells from Ila's company of women, "they have got the Hood Bay men
to help them."</p>

<p>Another burst answered the first from the west, at which the men
answered, "And the tribes from Round Head, let us get home."</p>

<p>With one impulse they turned on their track to fly backwards, when
suddenly the forest seemed alive with yells, as Mavaraiko and his
party burst upon them from the cutting.</p>

<p>"To the beach," shouted the old chief, suddenly waking up; "let us
die in the open."</p>

<p>And leading the way, he rushed towards the gardens, with the Hulu
warriors spearing and man-trapping them as they fled.</p>

<p>Through the native gardens they all rushed, without order or
discrimination, smashing down the palisades of bamboo, knocking
against banana, palm, and Mammy trunks, tripped up by disorderly
confusion on the ground of yams and sharded fronds, squashing amongst
the lushness of decaying vegetable matter, and splashing up the mud
from the watering pools, while their hunters, knowing the ground
thoroughly and the necessity of action before reaching the light,
where their disparity of numbers would be revealed, pursued them
ruthlessly, with savage cries scattering them as much as possible,
while they plunged their spears into them, leaving them where they
stuck, pinned to the moist soil; man-trapping them when the spears
were used up, casting man and trap away with force, to finish up the
battle in the open with their flint-loaded clubs and axes.</p>

<p>Through the gardens, and down the lanes, with the fires growing
less and redder in their glaring, the hill-men went in broken up,
disorganized masses, hardly even looking behind them, eager only to
get into open space and light. The old chief, borne along in front of
the impetuous rush and charge, the air filled now with sounds enough,
shrieking of the dying and stabbed, nearer blowing of the
conch-shells and beating of the drums, as the loud sounds of the
battle attracted the now united bands of girls who came on close to
the yelling hunters, with their lanes and gardens trampled down, and
sprinkled with dead and wounded men, implements of war, bare and
broken-down banana-trees.</p>

<p>As yet the panic had been so complete on the part of the mountain
tribe, that not a man of the sixty followers of Mavaraiko had
received a wound, but now, as they rushed into the dimly-lighted
square, for the fires were getting low, with this half-hour of
neglect, the crisis had come when fair fighting would have to decide
the question of victory.</p>

<p>Into the centre of the village, scattering the pigs right and
left, the old chief dashed with about ninety men left out of his
hundred and seventy--nine, and most of these more or less wounded.
With a rush and a rapid wheel round they gathered themselves about
the old warrior with their faces towards their pursuers: those
foremost had the advantage of a few seconds to form this impromptu
circle, for slaughtering is slower work than flying, and as the
wounded came on they were, with the characteristic trait of savages,
made to stand on the outside and act as barricades for those
unwounded inside.</p>

<p>Ninety men in the full light, with sixty men forming themselves
like a pack of hungry wolves in the shadow.</p>

<p>Ninety men who did not know the force opposed to them in that
darkness, and sixty men who knew exactly where they were.</p>

<p>Ninety men in a decided trap, more or less wounded, and sixty out
in the open, and still fresh.</p>

<p>The chances were not much in favour of the majority, in this New
Guinea game of "poker" for life and death.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>Toto bounded from the platform with the agility of an acrobat, and
found himself in a few more seconds dragging away at one of the
numerous small canoes which were lying well drawn up on the
sea--shore, with all the strength which his frantic fear inspired him
with.</p>

<p>These small canoes are mostly used by the children and girls of
Hula for fishing purposes or to carry water; they are capable of
conveying with safety a dozen or more, for with their outriggers they
can hardly either sink or capsize, no matter how heavily laden they
may be, while, on the other hand, they can be quite easily handled by
one, as they are lightly made and narrow, so not at all difficult to
drag along the dry smooth sands.</p>

<p>Seizing a couple of small paddles from many which were lying
loosely about the shore, Toto quickly got his canoe afloat, and for
the next five minutes paddled with all his energy in a direct line
seaward; then he paused to rest himself, and look backwards towards
the village which he had fled from.</p>

<p>The fires were still blazing away brightly, and casting long
glittering reflections down the many ripples of the coral-protected
waters, while the houses built upon the sands stood out strongly in
dark relief upon their piles, through which the golden firelight
became the more intensified. Over within the bay eastward of him he
could see the houses of refuge, raised from the waves, and about
half-a-mile from shore.</p>

<p>It was getting on towards morning, and the horned moon which had
lighted up their spirit-meeting in the early portion of the evening
had long since set over towards Round Head--the darkest hour of the
night, yet the stars were very lustrous in the dome above and
around.</p>

<p>Out towards the stormy gulf he could hear the unceasing rushing
and beating of the surf against the great coral walls, but on shore
all was silence, with only the merry fires blazing as a sign of
life.</p>

<p>Toto began to think that he had been a little premature in his
desertion of his friends, and began to east about in his mind how he
could explain away his absence if, after all, it had been a false
alarm. There could be no battle without noise, and as yet there was
none from the shore.</p>

<p>Had he not better get back before he was missed? No, there might
be fighting yet, and he could always depend upon his own ingenuity to
tell an easy lie, if required. Besides, he did not care much what
they thought about his courage, so that he did nothing foolish enough
to turn the father of Rea against his suit, and now that he had his
public promise he felt pretty safe on that score, so he decided it to
be wiser to wait where he was until he saw how things were likely to
turn out.</p>

<p>"I can always pretend that I went out to look after the enemy when
I am sure they are not there; but I had best be sure first, and then
I can pull quietly ashore and slip among them with a big story, which
I can easily make them believe."</p>

<p>So he consoled himself, and sat at his ease, looking towards the
fires.</p>

<p>By-and-by he saw the shadows of figures dragging at the boats, as
he had done, and quickly putting out towards him, at which again he
took alarm, and began pulling in the direction of Round Head.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>"What is that on the water?" exclaimed the old man Heni, as he
paused to rest on his paddle, with his flotilla about him, and looked
towards Round Head Point. "My sight is not good; look for me,
Kupatele, for your eyes are sharp."</p>

<p>Kupatele, a strong young matron of about twenty-one summers, rose
upright in her canoe, and, shading her eyes from the distant
fire-glare, looked long and searchingly into the star-lit
distance.</p>

<p>"I see nothing, Heni," she said at last, sitting down again and
taking up her steering paddle.</p>

<p>"Do you hear nothing?"</p>

<p>A moment or two of anxious listening, after which the woman laid
her ear alongside the edge of the canoe.</p>

<p>"Whirr! whirr! whirr!" very faintly and in the distance, but
decidedly different from the monotonous sounds of the surf against
the barrier; it was the vibrating sound of a steam propeller
thrashing and churning the waves, miles away and going very
leisurely. Sounds carry very far on the waters in those latitudes
during this season of the year.</p>

<p>Without a word, and regardless of sharks being about, Kupatele
slipped her raumma down from her waist and slid over the side of the
canoe into the shallow waters, which reached up to her breasts, then
stooped her head forward till her eyes were on a level with the
surface.</p>

<p>"Puff! puff! Beretana smoking-boat coming, and little canoe going
to meet it," whispered the woman, as she once more clambered into her
place.</p>

<p>"Ha! they will help our friends. Let some of you go and meet them,
and catch up the little boat if you can, Kupatele, and see who has
run away from the danger to-night," said Heni, settling himself back
to look on the shore.</p>

<p>"I think it must be Toto," observed one of the other youngest
women, "for I saw him, through the cracks, jump from the Dubo House
and run down towards the beach when the boys came from the forest
crying."</p>

<p>"And you ought to know Toto pretty well, Hankowa, not to make a
mistake in the man," replied Kupatele, in a jeering voice.</p>

<p>"Not more than Kupatele," retorted the other. "You were often
enough at his place with your shells when the Beretana sailors came
to smoke the bau-bau."</p>

<p>"Be quiet," commanded Heni, sternly, "or I shall tell both your
husbands what you say. Go at once, and bring the white fellows
quickly, if you want to see them again."</p>

<p>"If it is Toto, I shall soon catch him," cried out Kupatele as she
darted off, "for he is too fat and lazy to go fast."</p>

<p>On shore the fires were getting low, though still blazing, only
the reflections were more vermilion than golden, and the columns of
smoke which before blotted out the stars as they floated amongst them
now spread out transparently, blurring them only, and causing them to
shake and quiver with split-up rays.</p>

<p>As Kupatele and the women deputed to accompany her darted off on
their mission, Heni and those left behind heard the faint sounds of
the conch-shells blown by the bands of girls ashore, with the beating
of the drums, and at once responded to them with all their might,
making such a din on the waters that Toto, by this time almost used
up with his unexpected exertions, thought the enemy had discovered
him, and were making all this row for his special benefit, and became
so paralyzed with the horror of the idea that he dropped one of his
two paddles over the side, and nearly tumbled in himself in his
frantic efforts to get it again.</p>

<p>Meantime the women were coming rapidly hand over hand, while poor
Toto dashed the water about him aimlessly in his endeavour to get
away with the one paddle.</p>

<p>He splashed and dashed about with his canoe, making no headway,
while he lost his head so completely that he seemed to forget the
sea--craft which every child on the coast knows even before he can
well walk, and which Toto had learnt as a child like the others,
striking at the water blindly and frantically.</p>

<p>"Caught!" cried Kupatele, coming up the first, and running her
canoe prow against his with a bang which made it almost capsize, and
sent the unfortunate pandarus overboard head foremost. Toto gave a
shrick of mortal horror, which was checked before full delivery by
the splashing waters.</p>

<p>A faint gleam from the fires gave Kupatele and her companions a
rapid glimpse of the vanishing pijamas before they were swallowed up,
so that she exclaimed with a laugh,--</p>

<p>"What a funny fish that was! Let us dive for him, and take him
home to supper."</p>

<h3>Chapter XXVII. The 'Thunder' to the Rescue.</h3>

<p>WATER is a second native element to the Papuan, men, women, and
infants are all brought up to it, amongst the coast tribes, and such
a danger as drowning would never enter into the imagination of any
fond mother there.</p>

<p>Also, although at parts where the openings are wide enough and the
water is deep enough, the ocean inside the reefs literally swarms
with sharks, yet they seem to have a profound respect for these bold
divers and swimmers, as I have never heard any of the natives speak
of death or injury done to their friends that way.</p>

<p>We will leave Ila with his conch-blowing flock of sirens to watch
the progress of the battle, while Kupatele, with her own charming
disregard of prudery, sets the bold example of diving after the
recreant Toto. After they had caught him, they handled him with the
delicacy peculiar to their sex when they have a victim whom they
properly despise entirely at their mercy.</p>

<p>Kupatele and Hankowa must not be judged by the ordinary standard
of civilized ladies, or considered heartless because they could laugh
and make fun while their husbands were ashore risking their lives. In
New Guinea life is too slight a possession to create much anxiety
when it is risked as it is almost daily. When it is lost the grief is
wild and deep enough. People who have been born on the crust of a
volcano do not tremble because the earth chances to shake. Besides,
Toto had cured the ladies of Hula of much of the rigid notions and
finer feelings which still hedged round the women of the other
tribes, not yet blessed with Totos.</p>

<p>We will hurry on board the Thunder once more, for this was the
Beretana puffpuff-boat whose propeller had been heard by the canoes
on the waters of Hula, during this momentous night.</p>

<p>The Thunder, after leaving Yule Island, had gone without loss of
time to Port Moresby, where they delivered their cargo and letters to
the Mission House on the hill, to the Governor in his bungalow, and
to the solitary Store-House belonging to that enterprising firm of
Burns, Philip, and Co., who seem determined to plant their standard
wherever the foot of white man dare venture. They delivered letters
also to the survey party who were at the time planning out a Colonial
draughtboard-shaped city in this home of the untamed savage.</p>

<p>Here they picked up the bold Flagcroucher, and out of
consideration for the feelings of the genial old Governor (who had
enjoyed the distinguished warrior's company for a couple of months),
they offered him a free passage castward, which he promptly accepted;
they had also as passenger on the same terms, one of those highly
refined explorers who are sometimes to be met further abroad than the
geographical chambers, and in general are much loved by rough and
honest traders.</p>

<p>The Governor at Port Moresby having heard concerning the exploits
of Toto, and the Christianizing influence which he was extending
amongst his own people, so much desired to meet him that he had
expressly commissioned Bowman to go for him, and on no account to
leave him behind at Hula. So that the lucky Toto had unconsciously
been on the way to meet the very people who were sent after him, when
Kupatele frightened the poor fellow so much.</p>

<p>To Hula from Basilisk Bay the passage is pretty plainly denoted on
the charts, and, what is better, the places jotted down as safe are
actually comparatively free from shoals, so that they were going
along pretty easily on the night in question.</p>

<p>In the cabin they had partaken of a plentiful feast, for the last
sheep left aboard had been slaughtered that day and the Chinese cook
was pretty good at dressing it.</p>

<p>They were now assembled in the saloon discussing the merits of a
stone jar of Scotch whisky with "Tappit Hen" marked upon it. They had
their pipes--those at least who smoked. The scientific explorer was
too delicate to indulge in anything short of Ch&acirc;teau Lafite in
the drinking, or Egyptian cigarettes in the smoking way, which
exploration necessities the Singalese steward had inconsiderately
overlooked in his stock taking before he left port.</p>

<p>The General held the chair; he had voted himself into it, and in
spite of all protest constituted himself the single speaker; it was a
Flagcroucher solo, with futile interruptions from the others,
promptly checked off by the trumpet-tones of the military hero.</p>

<p>The scientific explorer had vainly tried to assert his superiority
by a few of those drawing-room airs and funny sneers, or milky
sarcasms which are effective sometimes when swallow-tails are in the
majority; but what are headless fun-darts when directed against such
a hide? Besides, they were too irresolutely delivered, and the
General had a ferocious bloodshot glaring eye, and a moustache of
noble proportions which intimidated the explorer, so that while
displaying his disgust as often as he could he did it so sneakingly
and so evidently with the intention of hiding it from the object,
while making it plain to the rest of the audience, that he lost the
sympathy which he might otherwise have obtained had he smoked and
drank fairly and given his opinion in a less refined and subtle style
and more like a man.</p>

<p>Sailors are in general a most tolerant race, and will excuse a man
who declines to join the social glass or pipe if it is principle
which makes him object, but they abhor the namby-pamby gentleman who
sits amongst them because he has nowhere else to sit, and gives as
his reasons for abstaining that their fare is not of the quality to
which he has been accustomed: they will endure a man even if he be a
bully and braggadocio much longer than a sneering poltroon, therefore
on the present occasion they, without objection, yielded to the iron
dominion of the General, and sent the scientific gentleman into
Coventry.</p>

<p>"When I was under the Brazilian Government, gentlemen," began the
self-constituted chairman.</p>

<p>"You told us that one at Moresby, General," observed the undaunted
Danby, puffing out some tobacco-smoke from the bau-bau he had learnt
the use of within the last few days; "tell us about some other
government."</p>

<p>"Sir! do you know that you are insulting a gentleman who has
fought under every flag which has a nation left on the face of the
globe--powerful enough to own such a thing as an insignia?"</p>

<p>"The black flag also, I suppose," irreverently put in Danby.</p>

<p>"No, sir, not the black flag, I make an exception of that and also
the German ensign; you are but a boy, sir, and it does not become a
gentleman of my rank and fame to quarrel with a mere boy--pooh; yet,
sir, had it been a man, ah, had it only been a man!"</p>

<p>The General poured himself out a large glass of whisky, looking at
the same time unutterable things in the way of ferociousness.</p>

<p>"I suppose he would have been as largely multiplied by this time
as the flags you have served under?" replied Danby calmly.</p>

<p>"He would, sir; I am glad that you know my nature so well; but,
speaking of the Germans, no man of spirit could serve under that
flag. I remember once when Prince Bismarck wrote offering me a
commission, I replied--"</p>

<p>"Have you not got the letter about with you? I'd like to see the
old man's autograph?"</p>

<p>"My solicitor has it along with the others which I received from
the European heads of government."</p>

<p>"A great pity isn't it, General?"</p>

<p>"No, boy, General Flagcroucher requires no introduction to
recommend him when he goes amongst strangers, his sword is
enough."</p>

<p>"Warranted not to damage, I suppose," retorted Danby. "But what
did you say to Bismarck?"</p>

<p>"It was just before the gates of Paris were closed that he asked
me to lend my aid, finishing his epistle something after these
words:--'The fame of your marvellous faculty of preserving your
valuable life and looking so successfully after your bodily safety,
through dangers which would extinguish most men, has reached me.
Serving as you have done with such singular success under the
different powers of Europe and abroad, have you never thought of
placing Germany under a similar obligation? If the idea has not
occurred to you, pray let me place it under your notice, with the
addition that there is at present a vacancy near to ourselves in the
army for the wielder of such a sword as yours.'"</p>

<p>"Very characteristic of the Prince," murmured the scientific
explorer from his corner.</p>

<p>"Ah, I see you know the old man's style, brief and to the point,
always to the point. I replied, with dignity, in a short note which I
think was not unworthy of a military man as well as a gentleman:
'Sir, I have served under many flags, it is true, and I think with
acknowledged success, but the causes in which I have distinguished
were freedom and honour, not tyranny and usurpation.' "</p>

<p>"A very gentlemanly reply, I must say," answered the explorer.</p>

<p>"I think so, sir, without being an egotist."</p>

<p>"And after that, I suppose you defended the walls of Paris?"</p>

<p>"I did, sir. You have not, I dare say, before this had the honour
of a real general drinking amongst you, but I like to be affable, it
is always the mark of true greatness."</p>

<p>"Doubtless, General; but that is my glass you are taking up, your
own is the one nearest to you, and empty," replied Danby, gently.</p>

<p>"The more honour I was about to confer upon you, my lad."</p>

<p>"I rather prefer the liquor, thank you, General."</p>

<p>Captain MacAndrews and Bowman were on deck, except when they paid
a flying visit down to consult the charts: at this instant they both
appeared for another observation.</p>

<p>"Where are we now, Captain?" inquired the General.</p>

<p>"Close to Round Head, I should say, General," replied the Captain.
"Are you not thinking of turning in? it is late, and we are about to
anchor if we can find a place."</p>

<p>"I'll have a breath of air first," responded the General, getting
up and stretching his lank, six feet of consequence preparatory to
moving.</p>

<p>"I'll join you in that proposal," said Danby, as he laid down his
bau-bau and followed the General, while the explorer, glad to get to
bed, complained of a splitting headache and sat where he was.</p>

<p>On deck, the air felt grateful after the lamp-heated and
smoke-stuffed saloon, so they relighted their pipes and leaned
against the taffrail enjoying that final smoke before bed.</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid of an attack here, Bowman," inquired
Danby.</p>

<p>"Attack? certainly not, the natives are well used to white people
about these parts," replied Bowman.</p>

<p>"Attack?" echoed the General, "who would care about a few savages
when I am with you--Ha! by heavens, we are surrounded." And with
these words the General made for the saloon steps with rather more
speed than seemed warranted under the occasion.</p>

<p>"Hold on, General," said Danby, "don't leave us at this time, we
look to you as our protector."</p>

<p>"Let me go, sir, I tell you, we must get under cover, these
savages have poisoned spears," and with these words he wrenched his
coat sleeves from Danby's grasp, and promptly darted below.</p>

<p>"Shut the doors at once, steward, the savages are out in force,"
they heard him cry from below, as they turned to where the canoes
were coming.</p>

<p>It was Kupatele and her attendant, who, having recovered the
recreant Toto, were now approaching in their canoes. Bowman, seeing
only two small canoes coming, replaced his revolver in his belt and
hailed them.</p>

<p>"Hallo! there!"</p>

<p>"Beretana!" replied the clear voice of the merry Kupatele, as she
drew alongside.</p>

<p>"Women," said Bowman. "It strikes me our hero of a hundred battles
isn't much to be depended upon in an emergency."</p>

<p>"A tarnation coward," growled the skipper.</p>

<p>Meantime a rope was lowered, up which the women clambered, with
the dripping wet Toto after them, and now stood on deck.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked Bowman, singling out Toto from his
dress, as the most likely one to understand English.</p>

<p>"Tell him, Toto, that we require his help ashore," rapidly said
Kupatele in the native tongue.</p>

<p>Toto saw his chance, and took advantage of it instantly: here was
the excuse for his coming out in the canoe alone.</p>

<p>"The mountain tribes are down fighting the men of Hula, and they
have sent me to ask your protection."</p>

<p>"How far are we off?"</p>

<p>"A little way past that point, in another moment you will see the
fires."</p>

<p>"Can you pilot us to Hula?" asked Bowman.</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Toto.</p>

<p>"Then let us on at once; return and say we are coming."</p>

<p>Toto interpreted to Kupatele, and added, "I knew they were coming,
and that was why you saw me before you."</p>

<p>"I know, Toto," replied Kupatele. "Bring them quickly, and I'll
not tell how frightened you were when we caught you, oh! cunning fish
that you are."</p>

<p>With these words they once more scrambled over the side of the
vessel, and darted away in front.</p>

<p>The General, hearing no signs of battle, now once more appeared
with his historical sword girt to his waist-belt, and a brace of
revolvers in his hand.</p>

<p>"Tactics of war, gentlemen," he observed, as he came towards them.
"I went down to prepare myself--have you beaten off the enemy?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" replied Bowman. "So I suppose you are now prepared?"</p>

<p>"Thoroughly!"</p>

<p>"That is well, for we shall have some sharp fighting before long,
I expect."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"They are fighting ashore at Hula, and we are going to help them,"
replied Bowman. "So you will have a good chance of distinguishing
yourself."</p>

<p>"By God! I'll do nothing of the sort, sir, I have not come this
length to sacrifice my life for a set of dirty savages."</p>

<p>"As you like; then you can stay on board and defend the ship."</p>

<p>"In the cabin, of course?" put in Danby.</p>

<p>"No, sir, we shall not go near the fight, you have no right,
captain, to risk this steamer or endanger the lives of your
passengers, and I forbid you to budge from where we are," replied the
General, with great energy.</p>

<p>"When you are skipper here, you may do as you like, but at present
I command on board the Thunder," retorted the old captain hotly, "and
go we will, whether you like to fight or shut yourself in, and if you
don't like these terms, by the Holy Moses, I'll lend you the dingey,
and you can pull yourself back to Moresby."</p>

<p>"I refuse to go in such an unsafe boat as the dingey, let me have
four of your men and the use of the whale boat, and I'll go at
once."</p>

<p>"Go to the devil as you are," said MacAndrews, angrily turning
away.</p>

<p>"You shall answer for this, sir, when we get ashore."</p>

<p>"When you like, and with what you like."</p>

<p>The skipper walked to the wheel, and the General to his former
position of defence in the saloon, while the German engineer, with
his usual snarl, put on the steam full speed.</p>

<p>All was now commotion on board, the Malay seamen got out their
guns and cutlasses, Bowman and Danby went below to get out more
cartridges, and prepare the explorer.</p>

<p>"Will you join us, or keep the General company?" Bowman asked him
shortly.</p>

<p>"If my headache is gone, I'll join you."</p>

<p>"All right," and the two friends went once more on deck.</p>

<p>On, at the furious rate of about eight knots an hour, the "little
hummer's" very fastest pace, the steamer ploughed and turned up the
white forth behind her, filled with electric sparkles, while the
female--propelled canoes flew in front, and very soon disappeared
into the darkness. The captain was at the wheel, working under the
guidance of Toto, who now felt quite reassured amongst the white
fellow, and no longer doubtful about his return. So he stood calmly
waving in the direction he wished them to take, and where he knew
there was a deep passage between the shoals.</p>

<p>Round Head Point looked up dimly as they skirted it, and then the
village fires became visible. They were lower than when Toto saw them
last, and objects in the distance were not so distinct. The houses
with their piles looked softer and blended more into the general
ruddy effect; from the canoes on the waters between them and the
shore, the faint sounds of conch-shells, and beating of drums were
wafted.</p>

<p>Nearer, and the figures in the canoes could be discerned, while
the din became louder, preventing them from hearing anything from the
shore.</p>

<p>Shrieks and wild cries of welcome from the women as the canoes
darted right and left to permit the Thunder to pass, while that one
which held Hena kept up with them, while a rope was thrown for him to
catch, by which they were towed alongside while he got on board.</p>

<p>On shore the clamour could now be heard distinctly, and a wild
tossing of dark figures could be seen in front of the fires, while
yells and shrieks uprose above the shrill tones of the women who had
laid down their drums and conch-shells to keep up with the
steamer.</p>

<p>"Heave to and anchor here," said Toto, "you must row the rest of
the way."</p>

<p>"Out with the long-boat!" and as the anchor touched ground,
Bowman, Danby, the two engineers, and four of the sailors had leaped
in and taken up the oars. As they were about to cast off, the
explorer came on deck with his revolvers.</p>

<p>"Are you coming?" cried Bowman.</p>

<p>"Of course," replied the explorer, getting in.</p>

<p>"Where is the General?"</p>

<p>"Sulking or skulking in the cabin."</p>

<p>"Umph!"</p>

<p>"Hold hard a moment," bawled out the captain, scrambling over the
side and heavily dropping down upon Danby, nearly squashing that
fragile young gentleman.</p>

<p>"You hold hard, old hippopotamus," gasped the youth, struggling
from beneath him.</p>

<p>"Saved my old bones a second time," grunted the captain, settling
himself on the stern.</p>

<p>Hena had gone over into his canoe before the anchor dropped, and
was now yards in advance.</p>

<p>"Pull away, lads, and a cheer for old England," shouted the
captain, and with a ringing British cheer they went at it with their
backs to the fray, as their oars drove the yielding waters tuggingly
aside.</p>

<p>A sudden blackness falls over the scene, they have replenished the
fires on shore, and the wood has not yet caught fire.</p>

<p>The women are coming on with a wild clamour of shrieks, so that
the yells on shore are drowned to the cars of the excited
sailors.</p>

<p>Light again burst out like brilliant sunshine, as the boat is run
aground.</p>

<p>"We can now see what we are about," cried the old skipper, as with
an axe in his clenched fist, he plunged into the shallow waters. "No
fighting in the dark for me, as at Yule Island."</p>

<p>They were all floundering up to the knees by this time, with their
faces to the fight, rushing as fast as they could to the dry
land.</p>

<p>The battle was evidently over as they touched dry land, whoever
had conquered, for a handful of men were flying towards them with
empty hands, with the conquerors behind them, braining them as they
caught them up.</p>

<p>"Fire in the air," cried Bowman, and a volley belched out, which
brought both pursued and pursuers to a sudden halt.</p>

<p>Then the unarmed handful of about a dozen came on, and with the
abjectness of despair, flung themselves on the sands, face downwards,
at the feet of the Thunder party, and lay waiting their doom.</p>

<p>It was the last remnant of the marauding hill-tribe.</p>

<h3>Chapter XXVIII. A Boat Voyage.</h3>

<p>HECTOR and Collins were, after all, fated to get their vessel
towed into the river as they had hoped, not an easy task in this land
of cruel surprises, when, for all they knew to the contrary, their
landing may have been watched by unseen crafty eyes; however, as far
as their short survey entitled them to judge, this portion of the
river was a low-lying, swampy, fever-infested, but uninhabited
jungle.</p>

<p>Mud was the most plentiful provision of nature--mud, black and
slimy--from which the scrubby mangroves cropped up and swarmed about
in a serpentine fashion, with a barren level behind, devoid of any
larger tree than low, unwholesome-looking bushes.</p>

<p>During this survey they started a drove of small kangaroo-rats, a
few of which they secured while the rest scuttled away; also, as they
wandered along the banks, at distant points they could see the
unwieldy form of the alligator as he rose from his soft mud lair in
the sun and flopped quickly out of sight into the deep water-hole;
they could not get near enough to shoot, for these animals are very
shy of human beings when in numbers, but they saw no snakes although
it seemed just the place for them to be, nor did any bush-birds rise
on the wing;--a deserted, silent, and forsaken shore; not any noise
producer.</p>

<p>By sundown they had the vessel towed to the cove which they
designed as a harbour, and made fast, both by her anchors and with
strong wire ropes, to stumps on either side of the river. Of course
they could not hide her, even if they desired such a thing, but as
they had resolved to risk her during their absence to whoso chanced
to come that way, they only took ordinary precaution against the wind
or tide carrying her away, and left the rest in the hands of
Providence.</p>

<p>An anxious night passed, but without incident; all through it they
were buried in the midst of a dense white, bone-chilling river fog,
which made them glad to see the sun when at last it broke through and
scattered the mist, although it took a good hour of hard exertion to
get the blood warmed up.</p>

<p>At mid-day they were ready to start on their journey, having put
up what provisions they could carry into separate packs, so much to
each man, after which they made their observations, and, as far as
they could judge from the sextant and chart, fixed their
locality.</p>

<p>They had drifted considerably west of Mai-Kassa, in one of the
smaller outlets of the Fly River, as yet unnoted on their chart.</p>

<p>"I tell you what, old chap," observed Hector, "we cannot do better
than stick to our small boat and pull up as far as we can, it looks
pretty clear, as far as we can judge, and from its course should take
us into the Fly about Ellengowan Island."</p>

<p>"Right you are, mate; I'd have proposed the same thing; it is
easier to travel that way, and we can stow a deal more away."</p>

<p>So in about half an hour all were ready, and after a hasty dinner
of what was left on board, they started on their journey.</p>

<p>"I reckon the natives won't find much to steal on board, even if
they do visit this part," said Hector, as they pulled round a bend of
the river and saw the last of their little craft as the bushes
covered her up.</p>

<p>The estuary which they had now entered seemed to be one of many
mouths of a considerable-sized river, for after rowing along for an
hour or two with little change of scenery, the mangroves began to
grow thinner on the banks, with interspaces through which they had
glimpses of country beyond.</p>

<p>Flat stretches of uneven country, with sand diversified with
scrubby--grey patches of grass, or oily-looking swampy places, where
the stagnant water was constantly evaporating under that blazing sun,
and sending forth noisome gases which crept over the surface of the
river unseen except for the quivering of the atmosphere by day, and
gathering into those miasma vapours during the night.</p>

<p>Both Hector and Collins were well inured to the coast fever of
these undrained shores, while the coloured boys with them do not seem
to be so quickly inoculated by fever germs as Europeans; still that
all felt the deadly and insidious influence more or less the
apathetic strokes of the oars proved.</p>

<p>While the mangrove forests lasted this lazy feeling seemed harder
to resist, while to continue conversation or even reply to questions
seemed to be too great an effort for the tongue to make; they lighted
their pipes only to let them go out again, and worked their oars as
if they were playing with the water instead of pushing against
it.</p>

<p>Still they made progress, for at this point the sea tide seemed
much stronger than the river current, and it was on the rise as they
started; so that it would have floated them inland even if they had
rested entirely. As it was they aided the tide a little, while it did
the rest to help them along.</p>

<p>Past those twisted and bare roots like snakes of various sizes
coiled about one another, amongst that oozing inky mud which stained
the briny greenish water which glided up after them to meet the
sluggish fresh current; sun-bleached roots of the shade of those
sea-snakes to be seen so often floating in the gulf when the seas are
calm and clear met their gaze, with the turn they had rounded, and at
the next bend blue like indigo and indefinite with the broad
vagueness of that vaporous scumbling.</p>

<p>Past that deadly slime with the deep shadows behind cast by that
raw green and blue black, amongst which large droves of rats
scampered as they rushed dripping out of the brackish water, and made
long ruts in their passage. At times also they rowed very near to the
saurian monsters who were caught napping, and who woke up to see the
uncommon sight just in time to be able to hobble down with awkward
rollings, but in terrible consternation and haste, and with a wild
splashing into the friendly tide, raising for yards about them foul
stains of stirred-up mud, and leaving on the banks from where they
had been disturbed a deep imprint in reverse of their mail-clad
bodies.</p>

<p>Above them the sky was blue and cloudless, with the sun white and
passionate in its intensity, but casting little colour upon the banks
of rhizophora; the spot where it seemed specially to concentrate its
full effulgence being the dingey in which they languidly moved their
arms, and which appeared to float like a white splash upon the
green-grey surface. Their line of vision was very circumscribed, they
could see only a straight line of discoloured water, edged with
mauve-like banks of purple slime, broken up with distorted limbs and
ropes of exposed roots, which crossed and recrossed amongst the mud
banks and unreflecting waters, and terminated in that wilderness of
unkempt greenery.</p>

<p>No wind came to fan their throbbing heads now that they were shut
in from the sea, while perfect clouds of insect life--tiger
mosquitoes, and gnats--hung around them, dinning into their cars
their savage war--cries, and biting till the blood came, even through
their thick flannel shirts.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind much to be out of this, Collins," observed
Hector, taking off his hat to strike a circle of his tormentors.</p>

<p>"They do bite," replied Collins, striking upon his cheek with his
open hand; "make us active whether we will or not, but I fancy
another half--hour will clear us of this jungle."</p>

<p>"It is clearing; make way, lads, before the tide turns," he added,
addressing the rowers.</p>

<p>A little more energy was here put into the oarstrokes, and they
moved faster round the bend and into an open space.</p>

<p>Hitherto the estuary had been turning left and right alternately,
yet still tending north-easterly in its general direction, with
narrow and shaded creeks leading from it, amongst the mangroves. But
now they were approaching a large basin, round which the bushes grew
very scarce and undersized, leaving large tracks of mud and sand
between, the mud clinging mostly about its favourite roots.</p>

<p>A shallow basin of spreading, mud-disturbed water, in which the
dingey continually struck against stumps, or ran aground and had to
be pushed off again into the central stream, which they could not
always see to follow.</p>

<p>Here they could look down upon the mangrove fringe which hid the
ocean from them, and breathe more freely, as across the flats they
got the benefit of the ocean breeze, before which the ruthless hordes
of mosquitoes were driven back to their twilight haunts, although a
few daring ones still clung swinging on their long thin legs to the
sheltered sides of hats and shirts.</p>

<p>In this basin they rested to ascertain which was the true river,
for the tide here evidently met the current on equal terms. All round
about them were wide openings, some distinctly leading to the ocean,
while others tended inland, to meet the river further up.</p>

<p>After a few experiments with some pieces of wood, which they
floated to find out which estuary had the strongest inland current,
they decided upon the one verging the most westward as being the true
one, almost at random.</p>

<p>"It cannot go far west," cried Collins, "it must back on its
course and join the Fly somewhere." So westward they rowed with a
fresh breeze behind them and banks growing firmer and more sloping as
they advanced.</p>

<p>Soon the sun went down full in the backs of the rowers, and dead
in the face of Collins, who was steering;--a golden orb, which sank
behind distant trees, the purple tops of which only they saw beyond
the banks, which were every mile becoming higher, and more
diversified in their character; in parts leading off into large
tracts of dense forest-land, while at others they had a clear outline
of sky behind, with an occasional gum or cotton-tree stretching out
bare limbs.</p>

<p>At dark they brought up against the first sign of natives, namely
about a dozen deserted hut-graves, which had been built on a flat
portion of the banks--silent huts standing up grimly against the
twilight, and slowly going to pieces on their piles. Scarcely a roof
but was broken in parts, with the frame-work showing under the
dropping thatch, proving that they had not been used since before the
last rains.</p>

<p>A background of sombre forest stretched out behind a clearing of
about half-a-mile of grass-covered plain, the grass being green and
rank like rushes growing over a swamp, and here and there were traces
of what had once been gardens, but the old banana-trees had all been
destroyed so that only young shoots were springing up, not yet the
length for bearing fruit.</p>

<p>"A big fight has been here at one time," said Collins, looking
round, "and one tribe the less in New Guinea! I think we'll be safe
enough to roost here for the night."</p>

<p>They made their boat fast to one of the posts of an old
landing-place, and all got out, glad enough to stretch their cramped
arms and legs, the Malay boys carrying the provisions, and the two
leaders going about examining the houses in order to fix upon the
most habitable one for sleeping-quarters. At last they decided upon
one a trifle less dilapidated than the others, and set to work
clearing it out from its present tenants, the fire-dried mummies of a
family of five, the mother and four children evidently, with the
remains of what might have been the grandmother; but the father
evidently had been killed in the open, and his carcase utilized
another way, as they saw no trace of him about.</p>

<p>With little ceremony they cleared out these relics of humanity,
pitching them carelessly from the platform where they lay half
sticking out from the dank grass, like pieces of charred logs. The
cooking utensils, spears, and decaying pieces of matting they huddled
into a corner, spreading out their own blankets instead.</p>

<p>After these preparations were complete they went down to their
boat, and dragging it amongst the long grasses further to shore,
covered it up so that it would not be easily seen from the opposite
bank--at this space a distance of about thirty feet.</p>

<p>After a brief discussion, it was thought best not to light a fire,
in case in the darkness--now gathering fast--enemies might be about
and see it; so they contented themselves for the night with filling
their billies from the river and qualifying their drink with a little
of the rum which they had brought; this, with ship biscuit and a tin
of preserved meat, constituted their supper, after which each lit his
pipe and laid himself down on his blanket, puffing in silence, with
the exception of one of the coloured boys, who had been appointed to
the first watch.</p>

<p>Hector and Collins were old and good friends, but they were both
quietly inclined, not much given to speaking at the best of times,
but thoroughly appreciating and understanding each other's qualities,
and the good faith which was between them; they knew one another's
stories, and having no fresh plans to air, lay in a harmonic silence,
looking through the rugged doorway towards the darkly clear sky, from
which the crescent moon--a thin half-ring--was now shining with her
attendant star, with the sleepy contentment of the smokers. Outside,
by the corner of the platform, the Malay sailor squatted listening
and watching.</p>

<p>"Whirr!" A flying fox darted past his broad nose and startled the
watcher. It had come from the forest on the other side of the river,
and was going to old haunts in the destroyed native garden.</p>

<p>The night was warm as yet, but before long the sea-breeze died
away and the night-air sighed amongst the bushes and brought on its
wings the valley-fogs, which sailed down the river's breast and
spread over the banks until the land was veiled in white and the
posts of the platform seemed to be rising out of water.</p>

<p>A low snorting and moving about at the foot of the posts startled
him once more into wakefulness.</p>

<p>"Boss Collins, some one outside," he whispered, creeping inside on
all fours and putting his mouth close to the ear of his master.</p>

<p>Collins raised himself up on his elbow to listen.</p>

<p>"Wild pigs grubbing after the corpses. Take one of the spears over
there in the corner and let drive in the direction of the grunts, you
may kill something for breakfast; but whether you strike or miss,
don't shoot."</p>

<p>And the skipper lay down once more on his back, sucking away at
his dead pipe.</p>

<p>The watcher passed over to the corner and groped about till his
hand encountered a bundle of spears which had been left to guard the
mummies, from which he selected three, and creeping out silently, sat
down to listen spear in hand.</p>

<p>The snorting and snuffing still continued at the foot of the
posts, so taking as fair aim as he can judge from the locality of the
sounds, he pitches his three spears in quick succession, the action
at once followed by a chorus of unearthly shrieks and a stampede of
many cleft hoofs in the direction of the forest, the chorus growing
fainter as they reach it, while at the foot of the posts he can hear
a sound like an asthmatic fat woman gasping for breath.</p>

<p>He has evidently wounded more than one of the herd by those chance
javelin-throws, and wounded one to the death.</p>

<p>Collins hears the sound also, and comes to the door stretching
himself lazily.</p>

<p>"There snorts our breakfast if I don't much mistake. Get me some
more of the spears, lad, and let's finish him."</p>

<p>The Malay gets a couple more from the inside, the others never
stirring, although he treads over them as he passes and half crushes
an arm under his naked foot. Sailors wake only when their watch is
up, or when they are called to face a danger.</p>

<p>Armed with the spears, Collins feels his way down the ladder and
over to where the sounds are still continuing.</p>

<p>When he thinks himself near enough he lunges out, going wide of
the mark the first and second stabs, but being rewarded by a gurgling
shriek the third, upon which he draws back his barbed spear and
plunges again and again without any response; the snorting is no
longer heard.</p>

<p>"Come down and help me, Jack," he says, as he stumbles forward and
gropes about for his victim. He feels along the spear to where it is
still sticking till he comes to the object.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" His hand touches the shrivelled-up breast of the dead
woman, in which the point of his spear is sticking, so with that
exclamation of disgust he feels more towards the left.</p>

<p>"Here it is, Jack," as his hand rests against the warm skin of the
wild pig. "A fine young fellow, and just heavy enough to be tender.
Catch hold of his leg behind there and haul away; he can bleed from
the platform, where the ants won't get at him before morning."</p>

<p>They drag the limp carcase up the ladder and lay it out across the
planks, after which Collins goes back to his blanket, wiping his wet
hands against his trousers, while the Malay boy squats once more to
watch beside the pig and keeps himself awake by counting the drops of
blood as they drip from the platform spaces with distinct splashes
into the pools which they are making on the ground below.</p>

<h3>Chapter XXIX. A Tribe of Butchers.</h3>

<p>THE next morning our explorers lit a fire while the heavy mists
still hung about, and cutting some chops from their prize, roasted
them on the embers and made a hearty breakfast, after which they
carefully extinguished the fires by pouring water over and then
scattering the ashes; which done, they lay about on the logs smoking
and waiting on the clearing up.</p>

<p>"I wonder how much further west the river means to go!" remarked
Hector, in his quiet way, as he watched his pipe-wreaths curl up and
get lost amongst the silver mist which the sun was now making
luminous.</p>

<p>"Not much longer, else I won't follow it; half a day longer will
decide," responded Collins. "But let us all get under shelter before
the mist clears; who knows what we may be able to see once it
rises."</p>

<p>It was prudent advice, which they all followed. When sitting
inside the shadow of the hut they were able to command all sides of
them from the doorway or the log aperture.</p>

<p>The sky above, meanwhile, seemed shot with gleams of rose and
faint turquoise blue, while pale yellow rays began to pierce through
the gauze curtain, which seemed to be lifting up layer by layer.</p>

<p>Butterflies in many varieties fluttered about and caught the
sun-rays; they came from and dashed again into that silvery
vagueness, with river--flies on long, transparent wings, which
glistened with prismatic flashes as they darted about--a scene of
fairyland luminous with light and teeming with insect life and
joyance.</p>

<p>The grass at their feet first became visible for yards round them,
spreading with the fresh greenness of early spring as the billows of
light seemed to race after the mist-wreaths and drive them up amongst
the clouds.</p>

<p>Then they saw the landing-place, where lay their boat concealed,
and next the river, like quicksilver, from which columns of steam
seemed to be curling and rolling along.</p>

<p>The opposite banks come into view, and then the forest, hazy and
fresh, looms upon the sight, and they may resume their journey
whenever they please.</p>

<p>"Hold on, boys, don't go out," said Collins, in as soft a voice as
he can get his shrill pipe to emit, as he looks through a crevice
towards the inland bush. "Do you see the devils?"</p>

<p>Hector applies his eyes to the side Collins is looking from, as do
the others, and all watch intently the sight which meets their
gaze.</p>

<p>Three natives have broken from the forest and are flying along the
further edge of the swamp, while behind them follow about a dozen of
their enemies, armed with that terrible weapon, the man-trap.</p>

<p>It is a short run across that open space, yet the hunters are too
much for the hunted. Tall men are those who pursue, and darker in
colour than the men who run in front.</p>

<p>A second or two of excitement for those who are watching, and then
it is over; the man-traps are thrown outward with unerring aim, and
with one shriek, which seems prolonged, the victims are down, and the
hunters surround them, hacking them up as they kneel down to finish
off their gruesome work.</p>

<p>"Do you know them?" whispers Hector huskily.</p>

<p>"Of course, we have both met them afore, though never so far west.
The Butcher tribe of New Guinea."</p>

<p>From the forest now appeared about thirty or forty fighting-men,
with skins glittering in the distance like polished ebony, and
enormous tufts of hair adorned with the beak of the horn-bill, their
shields on their backs, and with spears and man-traps over their
shoulders; some of them walked in single file, carrying, slung from
long poles, huge baskets. They were all above the average size of
men, while the leader appeared to be a gigantic fellow.</p>

<p>These are the professional butchers of New Guinea, who have no
fixed abode, but hunt men as sportsmen do game, as a regular
occupation. They have no partiality, but take all that they can
catch, cutting up the victims and disposing them amongst the
different tribes for barter.</p>

<p>"They appear to have a good stock in their baskets," remarked
Hector, as the party reached the first group, and called a halt.</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Collins, watching them intently. "By the Lord,
they are going to breakfast on fresh beef!"</p>

<p>Firewood had been collected by this time, and lighted, for the
large columns of smoke rose up from the group squatting round, tired
out evidently with their morning walk, while they could see the
bau-baus or native pipes handed round amongst those who were not
occupied with cutting up the victims or cooking. No one amongst them
seemed to glance towards these huts; probably they knew all about
what they had hitherto contained, and felt more disposed for fresh
than dried beef.</p>

<p>As the sailors gazed, they could see the huge pieces flung upon
the glowing and blazing embers, while the cooks watched them
broiling, turning them about with their spear-points, and, when
ready, lifting them out, and falling to the feast with teeth and
nails sans c&eacute;r&eacute;monie.</p>

<p>The gigantic chief seemed to have no precedence beyond what his
superior strength gave him. He made a grab at what appeared to be a
breast-piece, knocking the native who had taken it up over on his
back, and, without appearing to take any other notice of him, bent
his massive head like a dog and commenced to devour.</p>

<p>"Now is our time to get away," whispered Collins. "Let us slide
quietly while they are busy."</p>

<p>"I wish we were near enough to get a shot at the beasts," said
Hector savagely, as he seized one of the bundles of provisions,
slipped his revolver back into his belt and prepared to go.</p>

<p>"Not I; the deed is done, and we might be the next, although they
don't much relish white flesh," responded Collins. "You slip down
with the boys, and get out the boat, while I watch."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"Gently does it, boys; don't stir the reeds more than you can
help."</p>

<p>Very softly each of the men dropped over the platform, and crept
on all-fours through the long grass towards the boat, dragging their
provisions after them, while Collins kept his eyes at the log
crevice, turning now and then to mark their progress.</p>

<p>The boat is got safely out, and all are seated before Collins
leaves his post; then, with a last look at the unconscious cannibals,
he slips out and takes his place.</p>

<p>Between them and the next group of bushes lie only a few yards of
open space; but the grass is long, so they traverse the distance
safely, and then draw a long breath of relief as they straighten up
their backs and pull softly, but with steady, strong strokes, on
their way.</p>

<p>"Keep well under the bushes, lads; for we don't know who may be on
the other side."</p>

<p>Along the stream they glided, with the morning beams slanting down
upon the pallid faces of the frightened Malays as they drew their
long oars firmly through the waters, which glanced and sparkled about
the stern of the boat. Being well-trained sailors they made no crabs
or splashing, but feathered the blades as they drew them back without
raising them above the surface.</p>

<p>Silently they glided, with the river behind glowing like a molten
furnace, and in front softly subdued into tones of delicious grey.
They were passing a reach which the flowering trees overhung and
where rushes and floating leaves lined the shores, while tendrils
hung down in green showers, clustering with coral-tinted blossoms,
and rare orchids whose exquisite perfume filled the rarefied
atmosphere.</p>

<p>They turned over lilies with their near oars, and tore up threads
of plant-roots, which floated behind them like tresses of golden and
red hair, while the river flies of all sizes, from minute
white-winged, ant-like insects to the great dragon-fly, hovered about
them in myriads. Wings and buds of all the hues which aesthetic
painters love to blend, crossed one another and intermixed in
chastest harmony, while the sailors glided on into a phantasmagoria
of loveliness and peace, yet bearing with them the horror of that
awful carnage behind.</p>

<p>Before them, through this arch of loveliness, they can see a long
vista of dreamy haze banks rising, with sloping sides in portions
where land--slips have taken place, gleaming white and red, with the
under-bed of clay or sandstone, and a confusion of weeds, flowers,
and stony boulders lying about. The river banks change gradually as
they advance, and appear, as far as they can see, to be inclining
towards the right.</p>

<p>They had now got about a couple of miles from the huts, and would
soon emerge once more into the open.</p>

<p>"Hold hard a spell!" said Collins at this stage. "We had better
land here and prospect a bit before we venture outside."</p>

<p>They drew their boat under the bushes, where they were unseen, and
remained for a little time in quietness, with ears on the alert for
noises in front or behind.</p>

<p>All seemed peace except the sound of insect wings, or the flutter
amongst the dense leafage overhead of uneasy birds, as they drew into
the shelter.</p>

<p>The droning peace of a tropic morning with beauty and destruction
on the wing.</p>

<p>Then all at once that gentle quiet is shattered by the one
discordancy which over breaks upon the harmony of Nature--the frantic
howling and yelling of man, enraged and thirsting to do evil.</p>

<p>Distant sounds of warfare from the place which they have left.</p>

<p>"What is up now, I wonder?" uttered the matter-of-fact Collins.
"Has their grub disagreed with the devils?"</p>

<p>"More likely another tribe come across them resting, and paying
them out for their own darned treachery," replied Hector, as he bent
his head in the direction of the turmoil.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is it," he resumed. "By Jove, I'd give five pounds to
see the sport!"</p>

<p>"Let us see it, then," answered his friend. "We can get near
enough to see it before they wind up, I daresay, without being
noticed in their excitement."</p>

<p>"Done. Take two or three of the dynamite bombs; they may come in
handy to decide the question."</p>

<p>The Malays, frightened though they were, could not be persuaded to
stay behind their leaders; so, fastening the dingey and blazing a
tree trunk to mark the locality, they all stole out, Collins carrying
his Winchester and brace of revolvers, and Hector, besides his arms,
a small--sized bomb charged with dynamite, while the boys followed
with some more charges.</p>

<p>They did not find much trouble in working their way along the
banks, as the foliage, although in parts closely knitted, was of a
parasitical nature, and easy to break through, while they went
cautiously, but straight for the scene of action, guided by the cries
and yells which every foot of ground grew stronger as they
approached.</p>

<p>The tempest of carnage had evidently caused a great excitement
amongst the feathered denizens of the upper branches; for, every few
moments, as the men pressed onwards, the swift whirl of the paradise
bird or flapping of the wood-pigeon, could be heard as they broke
from their cover and sought more secluded places on the further
shore. Once or twice the men caught a passing glimpse of the gorgeous
plumage and sweeping red-brown tails as the birds crossed the open
interspaces above. Once or twice also they saw the glimmer of a large
snake gliding out of their way, and the ungainly rolling of an iguana
amongst the snapping twigs and undergrowth, while hordes of ants fell
upon them, resenting their intrusion on that virgin domain, causing
even the mild Hector to grind out a low oath between his clenched
teeth.</p>

<p>"Some one has won the day," said Collins, as much of the fury died
out of the din, but the clamour was succeeded by a great crushing in
the not very far distance, as of a head of cattle breaking through
the brushwork.</p>

<p>"By the Lord, they are coming this way! To cover, lads, as best
you can!"</p>

<p>Collins set a very rapid example by seizing hold of a strong
tendril near to his hand, and drawing himself up amongst the leafage
with the dextrous celerity of a sailor, an example which the others
did not fail to follow as best they could, leaving their bombs on the
ground.</p>

<p>They had hardly concealed themselves before the branches were
forced aside, and five or six natives similar to the three before
noticed broke through in a panic of fear, with about an equal number
of the black--skinned Butchers behind.</p>

<p>"Shoot the devils down!" shouted out Collins, forgetting his
caution, as he covered his prey, and at the word from both sides
belched forth the deadly fire, and four of the hunters fell to the
ground, while the others stood with gaping mouths at this fire from
heaven, both hunted and hunters.</p>

<p>Then the two remaining black-skins recovering first with a bound
leapt back into the shelter of the woods, while the others, now with
odds in their favour, plucking up courage, once more reversed
positions, and plucking the spears from the dead men's grasp, made
again after the flying pair, never pausing to see who had befriended
them, but intent on vengeance only.</p>

<p>"Nothing like gratitude," said Collins, leaping from his perch.
"Let us go after them and see the finale; pick up the bombs, we may
need them yet."</p>

<p>The track was wide enough now for the explorers to follow, so two
abreast they dashed along, and in a few more seconds had reached the
outer belt of trees, with the swamp in front, and the scene of battle
spreading out.</p>

<p>"Gently, now, or we may fall into the trap ourselves," observed
Collins, halting under the trees, and going cautiously forward to
where he could see without being seen.</p>

<p>"Hallo! there lie the two who escaped our bullets," he said, as he
held aside the branch and peered out, "stabbed in the back. But where
can our late friends have got to?"</p>

<p>The two blackskins had been caught just at the open, and had
fallen face forwards on to the plain, and now lay with both hands
clutching at the grass-roots, with gaping spear-wounds behind, but
not a sign of the five natives who had killed them.</p>

<p>Over between the fire and where they stood the ground was covered
with dead bodies, lying about in all directions and in all positions,
black and brown, while half-way to the fire had gathered the
remainder of the Butchers, about twenty, surrounding what appeared to
be some prisoners.</p>

<p>"Surely the fools have not been caught already," remarked Collins,
as he looked over the scene. "However, we must help them out of the
mess, if we can, now we are here. What say you, old man?"</p>

<p>"Of course, old man; we can't leave the poor wretches now to be
cut up, so let's steal round the bush a bit till we are nearer
them."</p>

<p>It was perilous work to get near to them without being heard or
seen, yet the two men felt that they could not now forsake those
unlucky natives, whom they had already, at the risk of their lives,
befriended, so, with cautious steps, they crept round the forest
edge, looking out at the natives every time the leafage was clear
enough to see through.</p>

<p>Four of the five natives were now left in the midst of their
enemies, bound in the arms by strong withes. They were being driven
forward toward the fire by the others with harsh cries and heavy
blows, the blood staining their brown skins in several places.</p>

<p>The Butchers also seemed to be all more or less wounded, so that
it must have been a savage and pretty evenly-matched battle at the
beginning, and dearly won, although now the blacks had come off
victors some of them trailed their limbs along the ground painfully,
and seemed with difficulty to be able to raise their arms to strike
the captives; yet that did not make them any the less vengeful in
their efforts.</p>

<p>"Boss Collins, let us go back; black fellow all same. Going to
roast brown fellow, you see."</p>

<p>Yes, it seemed that such was the atrocious intention of the
Butchers, for as Collins and Hector got nearly opposite to the fire,
they saw some of the savages busily engaged roping their prisoners to
the bleached trunk of a dead gum-tree, which stood with forked
branches on the margin of the swamp, while the others were busily
scattered about gathering firewood.</p>

<p>Some of the wood-collectors came very close to where the party
stood watching them, while they stood ready to fire, but none came
near enough to discover them, so that they were allowed to take back
their load.</p>

<p>"Had we not better make our rush now and free the poor fellows,"
said Hector, who seemed impatient to begin the fray.</p>

<p>"No," replied Collins. "Let them all be together, then our shots
will take more effect. We must let none of the demons escape to alarm
the country now that we are in for it."</p>

<p>"So, so," remarked Hector. "You give the word of command, only I
hope we won't kill our friends as well as our enemies."</p>

<p>"That will just have to be as it happens," replied Collins,
grimly.</p>

<p>"Are the bombs handy?"</p>

<p>"Here they are."</p>

<p>"Be ready to light one, Jack, and when I give the word the rest
pick out his man, aiming from the eastern edge of the crowd inwards
as you stand; that will make those we don't hit start in a body from
the stake. Then, before they have time to spread, pitch it clear
amongst them, and the game is our own."</p>

<p>"Right, mate."</p>

<p>"Now, Jack, light the fuse."</p>

<p>Jack obeyed with silent and methodical unconcern, as if it was a
pipe of tobacco he had been asked to light, and now stood with the
bomb in his hand blowing on the fizzing match.</p>

<p>"Fire, boys!"</p>

<p>Four well-aimed shots blazed forth with almost one report, and for
an instant the smoke prevented them seeing the result. When the white
puffs cleared from before their eyes they saw four prostrate figures,
with the others skurrying panic-stricken in a huddled mass westward,
with the prisoners left alone bound to the tree.</p>

<p>"Hand me that lighted bomb, and set another going quick."</p>

<p>It was nearly burnt down as Collins seized it, and with all his
might sent it spinning in the direction of the flying crowd.</p>

<p>A moment it spun through the air like a tennis-ball, then it
dropped about ten yards on the other side of the running group now
beginning to scatter.</p>

<p>"The other one!"</p>

<p>Again the lighted ball went through the air, landing between the
stake and the Butchers.</p>

<p>A second as the band hurried on towards the first ball, then the
sound as of a rock blasting as they seemed to be beaten back by a
dense volume of smoke which quickly hid them from sight.</p>

<p>Another explosion, as the second bomb burst, made the earth
tremble under their feet, while bits of clay and dead wood seemed to
be flying about, and a blinding shower of mud came pattering down
upon their faces, while the field was rolling with white clouds, and
only cries of affright or agony could be heard from its midst.</p>

<p>"That will about do the trick, I fancy," said Collins, putting
another charge into his Winchester. "When this smoke clears we'll
polish off the rest, if there are any left; when the time comes to
kill it is the worst policy to leave one to peach."</p>

<p>The smoke rolling westward revealed the gum-tree first, with the
four prisoners struggling madly to release themselves from their
bondage, and apparently almost frantic with horror at this awful
visitation. They were unhurt by the explosion, although spattered
with slush from the swamp, which had been cast up high into the air
and rained down again; but the old tree had suffered severely in its
top branches.</p>

<p>As the air cleared about the scene of the disaster it could be
seen that Collins had done his work of destruction with expedience
and method, for only scattered remnants of humanity covered the
field, while the ground presented the aspect of an earthquake. Not
one of the Butcher tribe was left to carry the wonderful news about,
and not a few were as completely dismembered as if some of their own
craft had been at work.</p>

<p>A sickening picture, with the black earth sucking in the hot red
blood, and the fierce mid-ray licking up the rank fumes.</p>

<p>As they broke from their cover, yellow flames burst from the pile
of wood gathered around the captives--the blacks had fired the wood
before the first shots had chased them to their doom.</p>

<p>To draw out their sheath-knives and rush towards the tree was the
first impulse of Collins and Hector. Another moment and the prisoners
were dragged through the smoke and flames, and laid dazed and
helpless, but not otherwise hurt, beyond a slight scorching and a
mighty fright.</p>

<p>"What can we do with these poor devils?" said Collins, ruefully
looking down at their prostrate figures. "I don't like to kill
defenceless men, and yet it would be the best way of squaring matters
both for ourselves and them."</p>

<p>"Let us take them with us," replied Hector; "they may show us our
road to the Fly."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, yet they are none of them to be trusted, although we
must not let them loose till we are safe ourselves."</p>

<p>So it was settled, and again tying up their arms behind their
backs, they raised them to their feet, and, pointing to the forest,
pushed them along.</p>

<p>Both men knew some native words, but the captives were either too
much stunned with their late adventures or else belonged to some
inland tribe with a totally different language, for they did not
reply, or seem to comprehend what was said to them, but limped along
painfully in the direction indicated with that apathetic air which
signifies the resignation of hope in a native breast.</p>

<p>As they left the field of death they observed the first of
nature's scavengers, in the form of a large vulture, swoop down from
the blue space above, while away in the far distance was a line of
dark specks rapidly becoming larger.</p>

<p>Through the broken-down pathway of the forest they retraced their
steps, and soon reached their boat, into which they pushed their
apathetic prisoners, and then, shoving out from the drooping
branches, swiftly pulled past the forest and into open country once
more.</p>

<p>The natives sat where they had been placed, never looking up or
showing interest in any action from those on board.</p>

<p>After an hour of hard rowing they all laid to, being thoroughly
fagged out and ready for dinner; so at a sign from Collins they put
in to shore, and, landing, set about lighting a fire to boil their
billies.</p>

<p>An open country, still flat or only slightly hilly, but grass
covered, with here and there a solitary tree--a good part for game,
such as kangaroos, but without a sign of habitations.</p>

<p>But the river was decidedly tending towards the west; a turn to
the cast now and again filled them with hope, to be again
disappointed as they could not but observe its general direction.</p>

<p>"What are we to do next, captain?" observed Hector, looking up,
while they were drinking their tea Australian fashion, with their
biscuit and tinned mutton.</p>

<p>"I think, while the boys rest a bit, you and I will go and hunt
for an hour against to-night's supper, after which we'll keep on till
dark as we are, and consider the matter then."</p>

<p>The natives by this time had somewhat recovered themselves, and
were eating the pieces of biscuit handed to them. They spoke in a
language unknown to the explorers as they ate, and seemed to be
fairly contented with their present position, their hands being now
freed to show that they were guests rather than prisoners.</p>

<p>Thus while the Malays rested, and having given them minute
instructions to watch closely the opposite shore, now not much more
than fifteen feet distant, and not lose sight of their captives, the
two friends went out on their hunt.</p>

<p>After an hour or two of hunting they came back fairly successful,
having bagged a cassowary and a couple of small kangaroos.</p>

<p>The natives expressed great delight at their success, and proved
themselves useful by skilfully skinning the game. They laughed loudly
as they divided the feathers of the cassowary amongst them, tying
each bundle up, and slinging them over their backs, showing no desire
to run away as they once more took their places in the boat.</p>

<p>Undersized men they all were, of a pale bronze tint, with smooth
faces and somewhat delicate features, but their dark eyes were
deep-set and close together.</p>

<p>After a time the Malays, growing tired, handed their oars to the
natives, and by signs taught them how to use them. They were by this
time great friends with one another, and took to their work with
great cheerfulness, learning in a surprisingly short time to use them
fairly well.</p>

<p>A burst of laughter rose from them when one of them made a crab
and went backwards, head over heels, letting go his oar, which began
to float down the river.</p>

<p>A laugh in which the unfortunate one joined heartily himself,
until he saw his oar in the stream, on which, without a pause, he
plunged over the side, quickly recovering it, and swimming back again
to his place.</p>

<p>As he climbed over the side, the long snout and dull eye of a
large crocodile popped up, and, evidently satisfied that his intended
supper had escaped him, disappeared again under the surface before
they could get a stroke at him.</p>

<p>"Let us stop for the night," cried out Collins, as the shadows
were growing purple, "I've had about enough of this stream."</p>

<p>They brought up to the bank at a point where it seemed composed of
stones and dried-up shrubs, and gathering enough firewood to start
their fire, set themselves to work cooking the cassowary.</p>

<p>A look round the country from the top of the bank convinced them
that all was clear; away to the west appeared a range of far-distant
hills lying faintly blue at the end of a vast plain, with hardly a
tree to be seen; the opposite shore also was stone and grass-covered
as far as they could see, with a spreading campaign all round.</p>

<p>The river had no connection with the Fly, for it was gradually
growing less. It had shallow parts from which stones and boulders
protruded, but still was deep enough to float the boat. It had a more
rapid current, which made it harder work to pull the boat. It was
clearly a distinct river, as yet unnamed, and fed from those distant
ranges.</p>

<p>"By Jove, Collins, this beats the Fly; what say you to following
it up?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind if we were better prepared; it would be some news
to take back to Thursday Island."</p>

<p>"Let's christen it, at all events, for it is our discovery."</p>

<p>"What shall we call it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, after you, old man, of course, hand you down to posterity.
Call it 'The Collins River.'"</p>

<p>Collins demurred with becoming modesty; but Hector carried the
question, the Malays agreeing to whatever they agreed, and the
natives laughing and showing their betel-blackened teeth at the fun
which they saw going on about them.</p>

<p>A pleasant evening, in which all were boisterously inclined, while
the rum circulated, the natives turning with wry faces when it was
offered, but lovingly patting the backs of their new-found friends,
as they gravely puffed out of their borrowed pipes.</p>

<p>At last the "Collins River" was duly marked down on their charts
and named, and setting himself to the first watch while the rest laid
themselves down on the ground to sleep, Collins filled his pipe
afresh and prepared himself for a good two hours' reflection.</p>

<p>It is a pleasant thing to have a book dedicated to one, or a river
named after one. Captain Collins felt it so, and thoroughly pleased
with himself as he sat down and puffed at his pipe, watching the
stars come out one by one, and the crescent moon lift up like a boat
floating upon a deep green sea.</p>

<p>"By the Lord, but I have been asleep," exclaimed Collins, rubbing
his eyes as he started up with a shiver, to see the midnight stars
serenely shining from the blackness, and hear only the sucking sound
of the current as it swept round the stones.</p>

<p>"Hector, are you all right, mate?"</p>

<p>"All right, mate," said Hector, getting out of his blanket and
stretching himself. "Hullo, the devil! Where are the natives?"</p>

<p>Ay, where? Jack and the other Malay boys roused up and looked
about them stupidly while their leader flew round.</p>

<p>"Damn the ongrateful scoundrels, they have stolen the boat," cried
Collins, savagely, from the river side. "I knew we ought to have
potted them with the other niggers."</p>

<p>"Well, that settles our minds as to exploring the Collins River,"
replied Hector. "We shall now have to strike across country."</p>

<p>"With only a single round of cartridges and our revolver, our
provisions and rifles were in the boat?"</p>

<p>"Might have been worse if they had brained us," retorted Hector.
"Turn in, old man, till morning; time enough to growl then."</p>

<h3>Chapter XXX. The Coming Home of the Fleet.</h3>

<p>"IF an apology will serve, General, here's my hand, and I beg your
pardon and grant your grace."</p>

<p>"No, sir, apology won't do, you have insulted me on your own deck
and served me a shabby trick, leaving me behind--a confoundedly
savage trick, and what is an apology?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry, General, but--"</p>

<p>"Sorry be----"</p>

<p>And the General glared over at the half-tipsy skipper, as he
brought his hand with a military smash down on the frail table in the
house of Toto, making the glasses spin again, and the table to
stagger like a drunken man.</p>

<p>It was the afternoon after the entry into Hula, and the General,
in high dudgeon, had been paddled ashore by Ila. His honour had been
outraged and himself made of little consequence, having had to
breakfast with the engineer's assistant only, all the others being
ashore, where they had stopped after landing.</p>

<p>The General panted for the blood of a foe, having been
disappointed the night previously, and now he bore down in full war
panoply upon the poor old skipper, who, having been freely passing
about cups, felt amiably inclined towards all men.</p>

<p>The remainder of the hill-tribe were now confined in Toto's house,
which had been transformed for the present into a prison, where they
were waiting to be moved on board the Thunder and taken to Moresby,
to be tried according to Colonial law for their attempted raid.</p>

<p>Toto had come out much better from the affair than even he had
dared, volatile though he was, to hope; through the dark hours of
morning he sat in the saloon with the General, drinking bottled stout
and whisky with him, each one capping the other's account of daring
adventures with some tale more wonderful, until at last, when day
dawned, it revealed the General lying on his back on the cabin floor,
snoring profoundly, and dreaming doubtless of noble actions, while
the gentle steward picked up the bottles and counted them carefully
over. There being no one on board left to contradict him, he marks
down on his slips some extra bottles; which done, he arranges his
slips of paper and waits patiently on the waking of the great man, in
order to present him with them and so render him happy.</p>

<p>It is this opportune moment which Toto takes for slipping into one
of the canoes alongside and paddling himself ashore.</p>

<p>He avoids the groups of natives, male and female, who are busily
engaged clearing the street from the dead, carrying those who have
been friends into their own houses to wait the burial, and hustling
the despised carcases of foemen up to the Dobu House to be dealt with
afterwards as the chief and his white brothers will decide.</p>

<p>Meeting Kupatele, he gleans all the news from her, how Mavaraiko,
the chief, and Kamo have both been severely wounded, and now lie
together, nursed by Rea.</p>

<p>"But Kamo is an outlaw?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; Kamo is the general favourite and hero of the hour; he
has wiped out his faults with many lives. Ah! he is a big man now, my
little Toto."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" sneers Toto.</p>

<p>"Yes; indeed, the Kavanah loves him as much as Rea does. You ought
to have seen him fight last night, while you were running away; like
an old warrior's, his club spun round, he saved the life of our chief
when he would have been slain, taking the blow upon his own arm, poor
fellow, but he is badly hurt, and it will take Rea her full month of
waiting before they marry, nursing him round."</p>

<p>"But what about me in all this?"</p>

<p>"Ah, you, they all laugh too much when the name of Toto is
mentioned."</p>

<p>"Kupatele," cried Toto, seizing her arm, "you have told upon
me."</p>

<p>"No, Toto, there were other eyes besides mine."</p>

<p>"Ah, true, then all my chances are gone?"</p>

<p>"Go away for a while, Toto, the great white Kavana of Moresby has
heard of you and wants to see you, so the Beretana say."</p>

<p>"You would like me to go, Kupatele, wouldn't you?" said Toto with
a leer of suspicion.</p>

<p>"No, Toto," faltered poor Kupatele.</p>

<p>"You fear lest I might tell your husband how you got the beads,
Kupatele?"</p>

<p>"No, Toto, you would not."</p>

<p>"But I might, you know, if I was not a good fellow."</p>

<p>"But you are a good fellow, Toto."</p>

<p>"Kupatele, will you do what I ask you, if I promise to go away,
and never come back?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Toto," eagerly replied the young woman.</p>

<p>"Then come to my house to-night, and I will give you something to
rub on Kamo's wound to make it better."</p>

<p>Kupatele started back with a sudden horror in her usually laughing
eyes, while Toto watched her with a sinister grin which revealed all
his discoloured fangs.</p>

<p>"I shall look out for you, at the time you used to come, after the
sun has gone down."</p>

<p>"No, Toto--not that."</p>

<p>"If you are not with me by the time the moon rises, I will come to
your house and see your husband."</p>

<p>"I will come."</p>

<p>Kupatele had a stern, white face as she said the last words, and
turned away without another word, walking steadily up the village,
while Toto, with a long look after her, went in the direction of his
own house.</p>

<p>Kupatele went on straight until she came upon a group of native
women who were gathered about the well discussing the events of the
night before. There were one or two amongst them whom she had in
former days met in Toto's house of call.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Honkowa?" she asked of them.</p>

<p>"Poor Honkowa, she is down in her hut weeping for her man who was
killed last night."</p>

<p>Kupatele went over to the hut owned by Honkowa, and entering, sat
down to weep.</p>

<p>"Honkowa, we are friends?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Kupatele, but you know how we acted towards him who lies
dead," and the poor widow covered her head and sobbed bitterly.</p>

<p>"It was Toto who made us what we are."</p>

<p>"Ay, always Toto, yet he is alive and unwounded."</p>

<p>"Would it not be well if Toto was dead?"</p>

<p>The women look earnestly on one another, then they fall to
whispering quickly.</p>

<p>"Will they not all help us if we do it?"</p>

<p>"All the women who know him as we do, will," replied Hankowa.</p>

<p>"You get them together when they come to weep, and tell them what
I have said, and bring them down to where the stream runs into the
sea; I'll lure him out."</p>

<p>The widow returns to her task of weeping over her husband, while
Kupatele goes back home with her filled water-can.</p>

<p>Toto finds his house occupied by the white party of the Thunder,
and exerts himself with great success to play the host; from a secret
hiding--place he produces some bottles of fiery gin, the Torres
Straits special brand beloved of divers, and getting a few young
cocoa-nuts, busied himself making grog for the company and
ingratiating himself in their good graces.</p>

<p>"They say you can sing Kanaka hymns, Toto?" asked Bowman.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, anything you like."</p>

<p>"Sing us a hymn," cries the Captain, and Toto gravely takes his
well--thumbed hymn-book, and seating himself cross-legs on the floor,
sings to them "The happy land."</p>

<p>"You are a sad blackguard, Toto," says Bowman.</p>

<p>"I think so, sir, very fair, all that same."</p>

<p>"And a great coward, Toto."</p>

<p>"Not a coward, sir, me very brave, like--like--"</p>

<p>Toto cannot hit upon a fair example all of a moment, Danby helps
him.</p>

<p>"Like the Captain over there, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Toto, making a droll face, and pointing over to
where the Thunder lay moored, "like the General!"</p>

<p>A universal burst of laughter followed this sally of Toto, and he
was at once established as a favourite.</p>

<p>They all sat drinking and talking until about midday, at which
hour the gallant soldier made his appearance, sullen and
disdainful.</p>

<p>"Have a tot, General?" asked Bowman, pushing the bottle towards
him as he entered, but the General made no direct answer, stalking
proudly over to the broad bamboo couch, upon which he flung himself
with a force which made the wall shake, muttering under his moustache
something about "low-bred cads."</p>

<p>"He is angry with you, Captain," remarked Danby; "I think you
ought to apologise."</p>

<p>The skipper, now more than half-seas over, cocked his bleary blue
eye in the direction of the couch, and stammered,--</p>

<p>"Cartainly, if it is necessary. I say, old cock of the walk, if so
be as I have offended you in any way, tip us your fin, and say that
score's wiped out, and a drink, and make friends."</p>

<p>The General rose from his couch, and walking over to the table,
said sternly,--</p>

<p>"Captain MacAndrews, you have offended me."</p>

<p>"Holy Moses, what more can a man do except say he is sorry after
he has asked your pardon, ye stiff-necked old rebel; will ye take my
hand?"</p>

<p>And the Captain put forth a horny and not overclean paw.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I will not take your hand."</p>

<p>"Then, if it is fighting you want, I am your Moses; name your
place and weapons, General--pistols, swords, Gatling-guns or
scissors, I won't say no, only one condition I ask, which is, that
this is to be none of your Frenchified sham battles."</p>

<p>The General stared upon him till his small grey orbs seemed to be
starting from his head, while the old tar kept two lobster eyes
rolling and blinking at him in return.</p>

<p>"Captain MacAndrews--"</p>

<p>"Ay, you may stare with your military goggles, and so can I. Look
on, my hearty, but hear my conditions; let us fix a spot, to-morrow,
or now if you like, I'm willing, only two of us must not come back,
it's a chopping up job, and no blamed nonsense."</p>

<p>"Captain MacAndrews," continued the General in set tones, "I do
not know whether you are in jest or in earnest--"</p>

<p>"Dead earnest, by Moses," hiccuped the Captain.</p>

<p>"If in jest, let me tell you, sir, that it is in very bad
taste--damned bad taste--on your part to joke on such a subject with
a man of my experience, but if in earnest--I say--if in
earnest--"</p>

<p>The General paused and paled visibly, as he hastily turned
away.</p>

<p>"But I don't think you can be in earnest, so I shall let the
matter drop, and say no more about it."</p>

<p>The company smiled broadly at this characteristic termination of
the quarrel, and poured out a fresh supply of gin and cocoa-nut, to
conceal their mouths, while the Captain sank back on his seat and
went on to inform Danby of a challenge he once had in South America,
the result of which had been to him six months in a Mexican jail.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>Inside the chief's house was a picture of mingled pleasure and
sorrow, for Kamo and the father of his love lay helpless on the one
mat, while Rea and Putitai were kept busy running under the direction
of some of the wise old women of the tribe, who were pounding and
boiling, and chewing at the healing herbs.</p>

<p>Rea no longer capricious and wayward, but moving about with soft
feet, touching where she could with gentle fingers the hot skin of
the fevered Kamo, and silently crying, hardly knowing whether misery
at his danger, or happiness at having him near her filled her the
most, for Toto seemed now like an evil dream which had passed away
and left no trace behind.</p>

<p>A subdued light filled the inside of the hut, and where the
wounded men lay the air from the sea stole in at the back and out
from the front like a gentle sigh; while in the centre, where the old
women squatted, were the earthenware pots ranged about a low wood
fire; an aromatic smell pervaded the apartment, the perfume peculiar
to native houses and articles.</p>

<p>In some of the other huts throughout the village, the same scene
is taking place, men lying passive on the mats and old women nursing
them.</p>

<p>In others the matting is drawn before the doorways where death has
come upon them, while the processions of young women are going from
house to house to take their allotted time of lamentation in each
abode of desolation.</p>

<p>The men who have escaped are also hard at work, digging graves in
the sand in front of each of the closed doorways. We know all who
have lost a relation from the black and grease which they have just
bedaubed themselves with, and few are free from these sombre suits of
mourning.</p>

<p>Weeping inside the houses where the graves are dug or being dug,
and inside one a group of women who have been misled, and who are now
shedding bitterly repentant tears, and between the tears plotting
vengeance against their destroyer.</p>

<p>The afternoon shadows are getting very long from the posts of the
houses, when the Captain, affectionately leaning on the arm of the
complacent Toto, with the General bringing up the rear, staggered out
upon the beach to enjoy the cooling westerly breeze, and see the
burials, which will soon take place.</p>

<p>Kupatele coming along at that moment attracts the Captain's
amorous eye, and he makes a lunge towards her, which she laughingly
evades, sending him full butt against the son of Mars. Both reel for
a moment, then sink down on the soft sands face downwards across each
other, making of themselves a fair sign of Christianity in that pagan
land.</p>

<p>As Kupatele glides past Toto, he says, "Remember--"</p>

<p>To which she replies with the smile still upon her face, from the
ridiculous downfall she has witnessed, "I will not forget, Toto."</p>

<p>And so she passes into the full glare of the setting sun, seeming
to grow enlarged as she walks from him along the beach, and
resembling a dark phantom in front of a background of crimson and
gold.</p>

<p>"The Lakatois are coming!" Toto hears a boy shouting as he speeds
past him at this moment with his welcome tidings towards the village,
and, leaving his prostrate white friends to lie where they have
fallen, he runs down to the water's edge, and leaping into a small
catamaran, pulls out to the open sea to meet the fleet.</p>

<p>Joy in the midst of lamentation, for all know that upon this
advent all their future mouths depend. "Have they been successful?"
is the shout from all, as the dead are forgotten by all except those
most nearly bereaved, while the shores are lined with rushing figures
of men, women, and children, seeking their own individual canoes, and
pushing forth to meet the bold traders who have been to distant
fields west.</p>

<p>A golden ocean, dotted over with black spots, as the catamarans
shoot out to meet the larger vessels.</p>

<p>"They are coming! they are coming!" are the distant cries which
reach Danby, Bowman, and the explorer, and force them to the platform
to see what causes the excitement.</p>

<p>Past Round Head they drive with their brown, double
swallow-tail--shaped sails nearly bent cross-ways, and looking purple
in that golden distance--twenty large sailing-vessels have joined in
that daring venture from different villages of the east.</p>

<p>Nearer they come with their pennons flying wildly, and the laden
decks swarming with figures. Like Greek galleys they look as they
bulge out russet and madder purple against those western flames.</p>

<p>A successful passage. The small canoes are crowding round the two
Lakatois belonging to Hula, and the dark figures are bending over to
help up the forms of sisters, wives, and mothers, as they speed along
with their shoal of small empty fry towing behind.</p>

<p>Bird-like they enter the bay, their allies following in their
wake, sheathing their huge sails as they gracefully bring up to
anchor beside the dark hull of the less decorated steamship
Thunder.</p>

<p>Then a mighty shout goes up from the shore and from the sea, which
seems to rend the heavens, as the fierce bloodshot eye of day sinks
behind the dark blue line of waters, leaving the sky crowded with
strange shapes, like clawing dragons and monsters of scarlet, orange
and smoky russet, with an upper space of gold and silver wings
floating over an immensity of deepening azure.</p>

<p>The dead lie unburied that night in the huts, for the living have
come again after a separation which has seemed like death, and their
wants must be attended to.</p>

<p>To-night they must all rejoice over their victory on shore and
successful undertakings at sea--all except the widows, perhaps, who
do not intrude upon the general joy, but shut themselves more closely
in with their unwelcome dead.</p>

<p>To-morrow all will join in the lamenting, as to-night they join in
the feast and song.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>Toto makes a capital jailor as well as host; his kind generally
excel in the social arts; they know how valuable it is from a
business point of view, and have not sufficient sensitiveness or
intensity of character to be otherwise than plausible at all
times.</p>

<p>He looked after his prisoners according to their necessities, and
gave them with their food comfort to digest it, not knowing when he
might want them as friends.</p>

<p>"The Beretana Kavana like brave men, and you are brave, never
fear, me see you all right with him, he great friend of mine, and
will soon send you back, if I ask him, with lots of presents to your
wives."</p>

<p>Toto passed from his captives like an angel of light, leaving
behind him a radiance of hope. Of course it was all lies, but it
pleased them and made them think kindly of Toto, and he liked to
please all men when he could, without hurting himself.</p>

<p>As a host he was equally successful, adroit in keeping peace all
round; he kept even the General in a genial mood, consenting to be
his butt and buffoon, while at the droll faces he made the others
laugh with him and turned the coarse, blunt jokes of the General
against himself. The skipper needed no finesse, for he was slumbering
since they had brought him in, with the unconscious calmness of a
baby.</p>

<p>Adroit also in knowing just where to stop with his filthy
inuendoes, he had said to Danby, seeing him young, and thinking him
vicious, "I show you fine girl if you like, to-night," when, seeing a
cold shade gather over the brow of that young gentleman, hastened at
once to correct himself by adding--"She come to sell bau-bau,
by-and-by."</p>

<p>The General was expatiating as usual, when in his cups, on the
injustice done him by governments in general, and the Colonial
Government in particular, while the rest were sitting sipping their
grog after supper and smoking, taking without remark the General's
abuse, while Toto hovered about like a ministering angel, ready and
plastic to agree with all, when the back door opened quietly and the
dark colourless face of Kupatele showed itself for a moment to Toto,
and vanished back again to the night.</p>

<p>Toto looked swiftly round, and seeing that no one had noticed this
incident, quietly slipped through the half-open door and drew it
gently behind him.</p>

<p>An hour afterwards they were still sitting as Toto had left
them--the others silent and hazy, and the General braying out his
political tirade--when once more the door opened to admit the gentle
face and tall thin form of the Kanaka teacher who had replaced Toto
at Hula after the latter's flagrant misdemeanour. This poor man had
only recovered from a severe attack of fever, his wife at present
lying very sick, and was now on his way to ask the white men for
medicine, as he was short of it. He came forward to the light with a
frightened air and said,--</p>

<p>"White fellow lying dead in the stream outside."</p>

<p>All jumped to their feet except the sleeping Captain. The explorer
had left them early in the evening to go aboard; could it be he?</p>

<p>Without a word they all followed after the frightened teacher to
where the stream emptied itself into the sea; a dirty, muddy little
stream, sluggishly crawling down through the sands a few yards from
the house, ankle deep, which any one could have jumped over without
wetting his feet.</p>

<p>The young moon was up still, but it did not cast enough light to
distinguish white man from brown, but the clothing on that prostrate
figure lying with face upwards was that of a European. The teacher
had turned him over as he passed.</p>

<p>Danby took the legs and Bowman and the teacher the shoulders, and
together they bore it to the chamber in which they had been drinking.
Down by the village they were holding their feast and sending back
sounds of rejoicing.</p>

<p>Into the light, and then they saw who it was.</p>

<p>"Toto!"</p>

<p>The comic man and general favourite, with staring, lack-lustre
eyes and gaping mouth chock full of the slime and mud of that shallow
stream.</p>

<h3>Chapter XXXI. "Help."</h3>

<p>"IT may be gold, mate, it looks greasy enough and dirty enough and
heavy enough to be gold, I ain't agoing to dispute that matter wi'
ye, but what is the good o' gold when we hain't got grub in this yer
wilderness?"</p>

<p>It was Collins who groaned out the foregoing, as he lay on his
blanket in the hollow of a small cone-shaped hill rising out of a
desolate and swampy plain. He was lying prostrate with spear-wounds
and fever, and had been so for days, helpless and peevish, without
the chance of getting relief by the artificial means of quinine or
any other medicament, and he was speaking to Hector, who sat beside
him, gaunt and hollow-eyed, but eagerly showing him something which
he had just found.</p>

<p>"It is gold," cried Hector, nervously, "and I tell you what, mate,
there's a fortune in this same little hill for both of us."</p>

<p>"A grave, more likely, if you don't have better luck to-day than
you had yesterday."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, old chum, I forgot in my excitement that we were both
hungry, though it's the first time this week past that you've
complained of that trouble."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do feel as if I could do a picking just now if I had it,
but I daresay it is only fancy, the sight of it generally turns me up
when I am this way."</p>

<p>"I'll get you some fresh water--thank Heaven, we have that, at
least--and make you a bit comfortable before I leave you, and then
I'll go off once more on the hunt. Had I only a round of cartridges
it would be easy enough; but perhaps the boys will be back to-day
with help; we cannot be more than thirty miles from Ellengowan."</p>

<p>"Not so much, I would say, as the crow flies, if they can find a
straight track. How many days have they gone?"</p>

<p>"This makes the fourth; and I reckon they can get over twenty
miles a day."</p>

<p>Hector left his friend's side with the billy in his hand, and went
from under the shelter of the boulder which overhung their quarters
and scrambled up the loose calcined sides of the crater-like
hollow.</p>

<p>"There goes enough to keep a fellow comfortable for many a day,"
he muttered to himself, as he sent down rolling at every step loose
masses of cobble-like conglomerate and glittering quartz amongst the
light dusty pummice and heavy lava flints. "Gold; yes, I shouldn't
wonder if this turned out to be another Mount Morgan."</p>

<p>He stuffed his specimen pieces into his trousers pocket and went
edgeways down the sloping outer sides of the hill to where the swamp
glittered in patches and threads under the early rays; when at one of
the widest of these he stopped and filled his can with pure clear
water, which appeared to flow from some spring.</p>

<p>Ten dreary days had passed since we left them at the river after
discovering the treachery of the natives and their loss; days of
hardship and trouble, both from unfriendly natives and want of food;
times when they had to go out of their course to avoid native
villages and wandering tribes; sudden surprises, in which they had
wasted the cartridges which might otherwise have procured food;
journeys painful though short, owing to the bad ground--sometimes
marshy and filled with treacherous bogs and slime pits which
threatened to engulf them, and in the crossing of which there were
many hours lost retracing steps and seeking outlets.</p>

<p>At other portions of their journey they penetrated bush-land,
sharp thorns tearing their clothes to tatters and lacerating their
flesh; venomous pricks, which would not heal, but festered and
swelled until the poor fellows were only able to hobble along with
great difficulty and infinite torture.</p>

<p>The ants tormented them by day, the mosquitoes day and night.
Nature seemed merciless, denying them shelter when they mostly
required it--in the open--confusing them when under shadow and making
them lose their way with her intricacies, tantalizing them constantly
with sight of food on the plains and in the trees, but beyond their
reach now that their cartridge-pouches were empty.</p>

<p>No, not quite so merciless as man, for she kept them alive, and
might have done more had they studied her more; there were berries
which they found at times which when sucked allayed their hunger for
a time, and that wonderful medicine-tree, the eucalyptus, the leaves
of which, when chewed, stimulated them like draughts of wine, and
which, when gathered and bound round their wounds or laid upon their
throbbing heads, cooled and eased them.</p>

<p>They had all been wounded in their skirmishes with natives, Hector
in both legs, and Collins the most seriously, so much so that for the
past two days before they reached their present quarters the faithful
Malays had been compelled to carry him by turns, wounded and overcome
by fever.</p>

<p>Here they had left their leader, with his friend to look after
him, while they set off towards the Fly River to see if they could
get and bring back help. They knew that a mission-station had been
established at Ellengowan Island, and hoped to find the Kanaka
teachers--if they had not been murdered--and on this prospect the two
friends waited as best they could.</p>

<p>Four trying days for Hector, with his friend part of the time
raving and the rest despairing and irritable.</p>

<p>Each morning he left him as he did now, crawling painfully along
the side of the swamp, seeking for food for himself, for Collins had
been hitherto unable to retain even the water which his fever made
him drink.</p>

<p>A rat caught in the moonlight lasted the second day, while a small
iguana supplied him with food the third day; now with his stick as he
hobbled along, if lucky, he might manage to knock down a snake or
iguana; but they did not seem very plentiful about this dismal
region. Still he went on, thinking upon his discovery of gold and
buoyed up by the thought of future riches even in the midst of this
craving for something to eat and the dull throbbing of his festering
spear-wounds, which at times made him reel in a sick stupor, while
objects whirled about him or grew dark.</p>

<p>He had been idly amusing himself that morning practising throwing
at a distant boulder with the smaller stones at his feet, when a
piece of quartz heavier than the rest attracted his notice and caused
him to examine it, to find it thickly impregnated with spots of what
he believed to be gold.</p>

<p>Neither Collins nor himself had much knowledge of geology, yet
this seemed plain enough.</p>

<p>Then he began to poke with his stick amongst the loose dark earth
and sand, and found to his delight that it was sparkling with minute
yellow specks as he turned it over.</p>

<p>In a flash he remembered Mount Morgan of Rockhampton, the mountain
which, against all precedent of digger and geological experiences,
was found to be a quarry of the precious ore.</p>

<p>Collins did not fire up as Hector expected at the discovery. After
six days of food-abstinence he had wakened up that morning with the
conviction that he might be able to enjoy a meal, if he had it, and
not having it while the languid craving was upon him made him
indifferent to aught else, present necessity being of much greater
importance in his eyes than only probable future luxury.</p>

<p>Once more up the hill-side and into the crater with his billy
filled, where, after making his sick friend more comfortable by
wetting his bandages, and after hanging up over the face of the
boulders his own blanket, so as to form an awning from the afternoon
sun in case he might be delayed, he once more went out on his weary
quest after the one thing at present needful.</p>

<p>"Might almost as well be in London as here, seeking for grub," he
muttered, as he shaded his eyes with his hands and took a long look
in the direction from which he expected help to come.</p>

<p>A scorching day, with a monotonous and dreary waste before him, a
vast spread of low tones and reaches of madder brown and dull greens
drifting away to vapoury blue hazes with intersections and specks
like quicksilver.</p>

<p>Here and there the unvarying flat line was broken up by bare
stumps or ungainly branches of trees, dead or in stages of decay,
with detached clumps of leafage upon the bleached limbs.</p>

<p>Also in parts rose grass-trees, like worn brooms with their
handles stuck in the mud; all desolation and gloomy silence, which
even that translucent sky and fiercely-glowing sun failed to lighten
or make cheerful.</p>

<p>The glare seemed to concentrate on the hill-side upon which the
lonely watcher stood until it glowed again in the middle of its dull
surroundings, the dried-up grass glistening like thin steel blades
amongst the prismatic pieces of lava, snowy flashing quartz, and
ash-grey pummice cinders.</p>

<p>His blue eyes were violet-tinted with the appalling heat--violet
flames in the centre of scarlet whites, while his soft boyish skin
was like a raw beef-steak, blistered in parts and with the skin from
previous burnings peeling off and hanging in white shards, like the
casting bark of a gum trunk.</p>

<p>A tattered spectacle as to dress, with red flannel shirt split up
and wanting the sleeves, buttonless at the blistered breast, and
hardly to be thought of as a protection; the trousers held together
by the rushes which he had twisted round each leg to keep the wounds
covered, a gleam of dirty white showing above the withered
bandages.</p>

<p>His legs had swollen to a tremendous size, so that they bulged out
the upper part of the pants till they seemed like bursting, while the
lower portions looked shapeless with the bandages. His feet were
bootless, and looked like gaunt stumps or blown out bladders with the
accumulation of water under the skin, while at parts deep cancerous
sores seemed to be eating their way into the bones.</p>

<p>On his blonde head he wore a white pith helmet with green
under--edges, battered almost out of all original shape.</p>

<p>"In London a man might hobble till he drops down dead; here, I
suppose, it is the same. No, by Jove, I'd rather be here than there,
for no one can look on my misery only the sun, which also joins in
with the hundred thousand cold eyes who stare on him pitilessly over
there; cold eyes and a cold sun. Here, at any rate, the sun is not
cold, and it is the only eye, besides that of heaven, to watch what
happens next."</p>

<p>No sign of the help he was expecting, so, with a deep groan, he
tottered down the hill towards the swamp, pausing every now and then
to rest upon his stick, while he panted heavily, or gave a sharp sob
when an extra twitch came from his dull and constantly throbbing
wounds.</p>

<p>By the side of the swamp he sat down in a kind of dreamy stupor,
with the white glare darting from the glistening waters to his
blinded eyes.</p>

<p>They had smoked the last of their tobacco, and he had not even
that consolation in this hour of despair, yet he did not feel too
wretched as he sat; he was past all thought, and now only looked,
without any emotion, having only the uncertain sensation of hunger
and pain blent so together that he could not separate them in his
mind.</p>

<p>As he sat in this deep stupor of silence and stillness, across the
white reflection before his eyes slid an interruption which woke him
up into acute consciousness.</p>

<p>A marsh snake, of the tint of green slime, leisurely trailing its
eight feet of cold life almost over his dropsical feet.</p>

<p>His stick was in his hand, so he just let it clear the track and
get to the distance where he could strike fair, then swiftly raising
it, and letting it drop, the slow movement of grace was transformed
in an instant into a writhing confusion of active lines, almost
impossible, for the first few moments, to follow with the eye as the
water about it dashed and shimmered.</p>

<p>"Dinner for this day," said Hector, with a shrug of his shoulders,
as he watched the motions diminishing in speed; "cheap, and not over
nice when one has to eat it raw."</p>

<p>And lifting up the now twitching and jerking but limp body of the
reptile by the tail, he slowly retraced his way to where he had left
Collins.</p>

<p>A sorry meal as they had no fire, and all the efforts made by
Hector to make a light, by rubbing sticks together after the native
fashion, or striking flints against each other failed. Collins' tardy
and feeble appetite failed at the sight of the feast offered, while a
terrible nausea overcame him as he watched Hector, much less
particular, gnawing at the flabby, eel-like body.</p>

<p>And yet snake, properly roasted, is very good and nourishing.</p>

<p>A long afternoon, with nothing to relieve the monotony excepting
the regular wetting of his own and his friend's bandages, hobbling
over the hill to replenish the water-can, or watch for the eagerly
longed for succour.</p>

<p>But the sun went down as he had risen, changing the quicksilver
gleams into molten gold, and nothing altered the general aspect of
the landscape.</p>

<p>Silence, where even the cry of a vulture would have been
welcome.</p>

<p>Night came, with the moon now growing in size, stealing softly up
and over their heads, while from the swamps came the croaking of the
frogs.</p>

<p>A chorus which started off at the deepest bass and passed up to
the shrillest treble, unvarying in tune and constant until dawn.</p>

<p>The insect marauders also drove up in their myriads, singing about
their cars and dashing against the exposed parts, where they swung
and fed, leaving behind as payment for their fare only
poison-stings.</p>

<p>Over head a wonderful plain of glowing worlds, golden, red, and
purely white, through which that barge-like moon seemed to be
steering from the east to a haven in the west.</p>

<p>And down the hill-sides and over the treacherous swamp myriads of
flashes of intensely brilliant green and electric blue, the countless
fire--flies with their lighted lamps.</p>

<p>Then over the land crept that pallid veil, which gathered about
the two miserable wretches like a chilly shroud, making them creep
close together, and shiver even in their torpid sleep.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>Morning once more comes up, cool and virginal, like a merry maiden
clad in white muslin, to find Hector lying beside his friend unable
to move a limb.</p>

<p>"I am fairly done, old man," he mutters drowsily; "we'll just have
to wait where we are until they find us."</p>

<p>"Or our carcases," replied Collins.</p>

<p>"It don't much matter," wearily responded Hector, painfully
turning his back upon his friend, and gazing down upon the centre of
the hollow.</p>

<p>Hour after hour they lay without a word, with the water-can empty
beside them, and the sun's rays gradually coming round till they shot
over the pair, making the pain of their wounds and sores more acute
under the hard pressure of their dry bandages, while a
newly-developed thirst was added to their former miseries.</p>

<p>They were both parching, without the power to go to where the
water lay so close at hand.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>Over the distant plain, not yet in sight of that coneshaped
land-mark, the faithful Malay boys are guiding the two South Sea
Island Teachers, with a dozen of their New Guinea disciples, to the
rescue of their masters.</p>

<p>The natives carry a large bamboo litter well laden with
provisions, boat-like wooden platters of cooked yams, with clusters
of bananas and cocoa-nuts, and beside them the large, generous mammy
apples.</p>

<p>A couple of large kangaroos lie swinging over the sides, caught
that day, and to be cooked when they have reached the hill.</p>

<p>They all pace out with confident feet, for they know their way
back, although it has cost them many a weary d&eacute;tour in the
coming.</p>

<p>Over the dry grass plain they pass, and approach to the margin of
the swampy land.</p>

<p>Yes, there is the hill, blue and dark against the mellow afternoon
sky; they will easily reach it before sundown.</p>

<p>Over the swamp, zigzaging, and in a line of two abreast as the
firmer parts gave them room to walk, sinking at times, by false
steps, up to the thighs, and being dragged out by their companions
who had reached safer ground, feeling every step in advance,
although, profiting by their former experience, hurrying as fast as
possible so as to reach dry land before darkness.</p>

<p>They had reached the hill with the last gleam of daylight, and
without a pause scrambled up over the ridge with loud shouts which
their leaders do not respond to, although they can hear their voices
down beneath the shelter of the boulder.</p>

<p>Hector is singing in his sweet tenor voice, "The Harp that once
through Tara's Halls," while Collins is talking in his shrill, piping
voice, as if to a third party, and paying no heed to the song,
although it is rendered with much expression.</p>

<p>They rush down towards them in a body, to see them lying upon
their backs with flaming eyes.</p>

<p>"Plenty much fever here, teacher," observed Jack, kneeling down
and feeling the burning foreheads of his masters.</p>

<p>"Light big fire to-night, and give them plenty sweat," replied the
head--teacher, and at the order the natives rush about to gather up
the dried-up briars and parasites lying about, and soon after the
crater is lighted up as with a second eruption, while the Malays and
teachers cover up the unconscious men with their shirts.</p>

<p>The kangaroos are skinned and portions cooked for the hungry
company, while the skins are also heaped over the invalids, as the
fires are kept up throughout the night by constant supplies of
firewood.</p>

<p>Hector goes through his entire r&eacute;pertoire, and begins again
as if he had been encored by an appreciative audience, gradually
singing in a more drone-like way until at last he seemingly sings
himself to sleep. Collins has talked himself speechless long before
Hector is half-way through, but now both are breathing calmly, with
the large beads of perspiration rolling like rain-drops down their
cheeks, and making the soil moist around the bed.</p>

<p>"They will know us to-morrow." observes the teacher, as he turns
away and flings himself by the side of the fires.</p>

<p>Soon all are sound asleep excepting the natives who move about the
sides of the crater gathering firewood and feeding the flames and
casting up the concave sides of the hollow long shadows which grow
vaster as they recede until they appear like great-headed gnomes with
crouching backs flitting about.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>"Hallo!" said Hector, as he awoke next morning, "I feel as if I
had lost a couple of hundredweight from my bones, and a ton
lighter."</p>

<p>"Better, sah?" observed the teacher, smiling mildly as he bent
over him.</p>

<p>"So you have come at last, thank God! thank God!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sah! it is well to thank the Lord for all His goodness; we
came last night."</p>

<p>"Wait till I get up, I feel fresh as new paint, though decidedly
weak." Hector had tried to rise, but sank back again wearily.</p>

<p>"Have some kangaroo steak first, and a cup of tea, breakfast is
just ready."</p>

<p>"Breakfast," echoed Collins, opening his eyes at the sound; "say,
stranger, have you such a thing about you as a fill of 'baccy."</p>

<p>The fever had been sweated out, and now the craving for tobacco
came upon him first.</p>

<p>A pipe was charged and lighted for him by his faithful man, Jack,
after which Collins lay puffing in quiet ecstasy his first pipe for
eight days, exhibiting no curiosity about anything going on about
him.</p>

<p>After a strong dose each of quinine mixed with spirits, and a fair
breakfast, the party got up, laying the two men upon the litter, and
prepared for the homeward journey.</p>

<p>Hector, as he got on to his feet, looked with amazement at his
lower limbs, from which the bandages hung loosely.</p>

<p>"By Jove, lads, here is a reduction; last night I had a pair of
thighs to be proud about, but now where are they?"</p>

<p>"Helping to water the next crop of grass, I expect, Boss,"
responded Jack, wringing out the wet blanket, which had been under
Hector and Collins.</p>

<p>All day they travelled rapidly, changing hands at the litter, and
feeding, when hungry, from the fruit which they had brought with
them, and resting only for an hour at sundown until the moon rose,
then on again, over a dry and grass-covered, undulating country,
until, about day-break, they reached the banks of a shallow and
slow-flowing stream.</p>

<p>"Halt and rest," said the teacher; "we are now only eight miles
from the station; let us have breakfast."</p>

<p>The natives scattered with their spears and bows, while the Malays
lighted the fires;--they soon appeared again with another kangaroo, a
brace of bush turkeys, and some cowled pigeons, gesticulating as they
drew near, and shouting out in their own language to the
teachers.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked Hector, sitting up.</p>

<p>"There has been fighting since we left, at Ellengowan; they have
seen the remnant of a tribe, hostile to us, hurrying off south, as if
in a panic. Pray heaven our families may be safe."</p>

<p>The teachers had anxious faces as they set about getting breakfast
ready, and appeared eager to get it past and proceed with all
haste.</p>

<p>Through a country becoming more thickly wooded as they drew nearer
to their destination all pushed forward, all preparing against
emergencies as the miles grew less, and sending scouts out in front,
into the forest, where a native path had been made, and which leads
to the river.</p>

<p>There it is at last, broadly flowing between its leafy banks, and
the next turn will show them the mission-station.</p>

<p>Over the trees between them and it they noticed floating vapours
like the blue smoke from burning wood, and an ominous silence sinks
upon the group as they rush eagerly forward.</p>

<p>Ellengowan Island comes into the view as they dash round the
point, and where the mission cabins had been the night before is a
clear space filled with charred ashes, from which the thin wreaths of
vapour are rising and floating amongst the trees.</p>

<p>"By the Lord, there is the Sunflower!" cried Hector and Collins,
as the two masts and hull of the schooner project above the
landing-place.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," says the teacher impatiently, "Captain Niggeree with
Professor Killmann passed up the river a week ago; they must have
recovered his little steamer, for there she is alongside, but what of
our wives and children?"</p>

<p>A loud shout uttered in various tones--men's, women's, and
children's voices uniting--came from the decks of the two vessels now
lying alongside each other, replying to the teacher's sharp words,
and proving that the shore party had been observed by those on board,
while they could see as they advanced two boats lowered and filling
with people.</p>

<p>Another moment and they can recognize one another; the wives and
children all safe, stretching out their arms to their fathers as the
boats are shooting across the stream, with the piratical-looking
Niggeree and pale--faced Professor steering their individual
boats.</p>

<p>"Hallo! Collins and Hector, who would think of seeing you here.
Where is your boat?"</p>

<p>"Wrecked on the coast, Nig," laconically replied Collins, shaking
his former mate by the hand and nodding to the Professor whom he had
met before; while the teachers and their wives went through
extravagant pantomimes of reunion, and the natives and Malay boys
flung themselves upon the grass to rest.</p>

<p>"What's been going on here, mate?" asked Hector, looking at the
burning ruins before him.</p>

<p>"A little mill last night--natives attacking the squaws. We
arrived in time to save the crew and send half of the enemy to
eternal blazes; but come on board and have a drain."</p>

<h3>Chapter XXXII. Port Moresby.</h3>

<p>THE Thunder anchors once more in Basilisk Bay, and the prisoners
from Hula have been removed to the new wooden structure, which has
just been finished as a jail over in the township, as yet with only
this house upon it.</p>

<p>A small guard of Hannabada young men act with great importance and
satisfaction the part of jailors and patrols over this batch of legal
captives, while from behind the iron bars, the dark faces peer out at
the bright sunlit sea-shore with very dejected and pensive eyes.</p>

<p>General Flagcroucher has been invited in kind but firm tones, by
the Governor's secretary, to go on board the Government sloop, and
accompany his Excellency back to Thursday Island, where he purposes
landing him and leaving him to relate to credulous audiences
throughout the colonies and at home, the story of his marvellous and
hair-breadth escapes in New Guinea, and to speak in terms of praise
or censure about the hospitality he met with there.</p>

<p>The Governor is an easy-going man, and does not mind what the
General may say about him, more than he minds a few extra mosquitoes
of an evening, having by this time become well used to both
nuisances.</p>

<p>He steps on board to shake hands with Bowman and Danby before
leaving.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, gentlemen, I hope you have enjoyed your visit to
Hula?"</p>

<p>"First rate, Sir John!"</p>

<p>"Use the bungalow while at Moresby. I have left instructions with
the Captain about that job I want you to do, if you have time. We can
give you a couple more weeks. That ought to do; see if you can open
up the Aird River a little more, or find something fresh about that
part of the coast. Your leader, Mr. Brown, is an able man, and has
done good work before, he will be with you shortly--and, I say, try
if you can hear anything of Killmann, we are getting uneasy at his
long silence."</p>

<p>"We will do what we can, your Excellency!"</p>

<p>"Good-bye again; I'll meet you at Thursday Island on your
return."</p>

<p>His Excellency shakes hands all round, and getting into his boat
is rowed on board the Government sloop, which in a short time has
lifted anchor and shaken out her sails.</p>

<p>The Thunder fires her gun in honour of the occasions, and yells
shrilly on her steam whistle, which the Governor responds to; a
waving of pith helmets, and New Guinea has seen the last of that
leader of armies, the General.</p>

<p>As they are still watching the departure, a boat from the shore
joins on to them, with three or four white gentlemen on board; with
nimble steps they leap on to the deck.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Bowman?"</p>

<p>"How are you, Brown? How are you, Graham?" &amp;c., &amp;c., as
they all shake hands, and go down below to try the "tappit hen."</p>

<p>"You know the instructions from headquarters, I suppose,
Bowman?"</p>

<p>"So I hear you are boss of the show, Brown; when do we start?"</p>

<p>"As soon as we can take in water and overhaul our provisions.
Graham will go over the list with us, and make us right where we are
short."</p>

<p>"Oh, we have loads to last us another month; however, I will show
you the list, and what we have used up."</p>

<p>And the three men, with the Captain and the steward, were in a
moment hard at work stock-taking.</p>

<p>Mr. Brown was a determined-looking, sharp-speaking young fellow of
about thirty-five; he was free and off-hand in his general manner and
very quickly settled business and returned once more to his pipe and
glass.</p>

<p>"That will do for one day, Captain. Have you begun to take in
water?"</p>

<p>"The niggers are hard at it now."</p>

<p>"Then we will start at daybreak to-morrow. Steward, have you any
cham?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sah, one case only."</p>

<p>"Well, we don't want it on our journey, so what say you to a
little party to-night, gentlemen? There are the war-sloop party of
officers, the Rev. Mr. and Mrs. Lang, for respectability, the
surveyor, and Captain Maunville, of the Bungalow."</p>

<p>"Not a bad idea, if they will come."</p>

<p>"Oh, they'll come fast enough. I wonder when any of them tasted
champagne last!"</p>

<p>"But how are we to hold them?"</p>

<p>"We'll manage, don't fret, old man."</p>

<p>"Best take the store for the occasion," observed Graham
slowly.</p>

<p>Mr. Graham never was long free of fever, and just now was languid
from a recent attack, yet his faith in and love for New Guinea never
died out. It was his own land, much of it by right of discovery, and
in it he meant to leave his bones.</p>

<p>"Take your place, and have our throats cut by your mad cook! not
for this child."</p>

<p>"He is all right to-night."</p>

<p>"Yes, but how about this afternoon? Why, gentlemen, if I hadn't
dropped by accident into the place, and separated them, you would
have had the old man's head to take back as a curiosity. Sambo was
busy with a chopping-axe upon his master."</p>

<p>It appeared that Mr. Graham's body-servant was given to what his
master kindly called fits, and while these were on him his weakness
consisted in murderous proclivities. He was a native of Moresby, and
a favourite with his employer, who always excused these
paroxysms.</p>

<p>"Drink up, lads, and let us go round with our invitations; we'll
know, then, who are coming. Steward, tell the cook to do his best
against six o'clock; and, Captain, try to comb out your hair for
once."</p>

<p>After the glasses were empty, they all pulled ashore, and made for
the mission headquarters, where Mr. and Mrs. Lang were now staying;
it was a prettily situated house on the face of an eminence,
overlooking the village of Elevire, with the lofty Mount Pullen
rising up behind. The school-house stood close at hand, where, under
their supervision, and with the assistance of South-sea teachers,
over a hundred native boys and girls were learning to read and write,
with such other accomplishments as the native mind could grasp.</p>

<p>As they passed along the beach they came upon a group of
youngsters, some of very tender years, practising
spear-throwing--making it a game, as our children might play with
dolls.</p>

<p>The eldest set up a stick as a target, and they all took turns
with a number of toy spears, trying to get nearest the mark, and
striving to ascertain who could pitch farthest.</p>

<p>They observed that the elder children were very particular in
making the younger ones take the correct pose of the body when
aiming, also in the position of their fingers as they grasped the
spear.</p>

<p>It was also astonishing to notice the strength and art with which
they made the fling, by a peculiar motion of the wrist, without the
hand seeming to move; they observed the weapon to quiver for a few
seconds, then it was sent straight on its mission.</p>

<p>Few even of the youngest fell far short of the mark. Some of the
children could not have been older than two years of age.</p>

<p>Going up the winding steps to the mission-house they met a couple
of the teachers' wives coming down with their babies in their
arms--graceful Kanaka girls, who bent their heads modestly as they
passed, with their simple blue and white-spotted robes falling from
their sloping shoulders, like the fashionable afternoon tea-gowns;
lovely-faced women with blue-black, long straight tresses and large,
tender and melancholy eyes.</p>

<p>Up at the house they were kindly received by the missionary and
his wife, who spoke with sorrow about the tragedy at Hula, and seemed
at a loss to know how to deal with the culprits.</p>

<p>"What they have done is no wrong according to their old creed.
This particular tribe are amongst those who did not send
representatives to confirm the annexing ceremony, so I don't suppose
they recognize our authority or right to interfere with their private
action; besides, I think they have been punished enough already. I
expect we shall have to let them go in a day or two."</p>

<p>"Regarding Toto?"</p>

<p>"No one ought to regret his death, whoever caused it, for he has
demoralized Hula, and yet he was one of our aptest scholars
here."</p>

<p>"A little too apt, perhaps," responded Bowman.</p>

<p>They saw the school, and the children learning from the black
board and listened to them singing one or two school-board songs.
They were all, nearly without exception, bright, intelligent
specimens of boy and girlhood, and made merry over their tasks.</p>

<p>"There grows the future New Guinea, gentlemen, and a prosperous
future it must be if we can keep back the taste of fire-water; as
yet, with the exception of Toto, no New Guinea native has taken
kindly to it; they all regard it as a very nasty medicine."</p>

<p>They were learning to read and write at Moresby, and some had
already learnt the necessity of wearing a shirt to cover themselves
with, as did our first parents when they had partaken of the apple of
knowledge. How long will the cocoanuts and yams content them? At
present, with their one banana-tree, they are wealthy, because they
have enough, but with the Western problem of progress put before
them, how long will they be able to keep poverty back?</p>

<p>The other day I heard a school-teacher wondering which foreign
mission would be the most profitable, in a Christian sense, to endow
with the savings of his pupils. It was a cold, miserable day in
London, and the unemployed workmen were starving to death in the
streets and East-end dens by thousands. I did not like to suggest New
Guinea, with its warm sunshine and utter absence of want or
privation, as our English savages understand the words, simply
because I had travelled through those lands.</p>

<p>Cannibalism is much more frightful to contemplate than starvation,
when we stand back and view them both from a safe distance; but when
close enough to the two evils I am inclined to lean in the matter of
opinion towards starvation as the bigger horror. Murder, of course,
is rampant all over the world, and not a whit more revolting as to
detail in New Guinea than it is in Christian England. Starvation
thrives in this land of fogs and ice, and cannibalism in that
atmosphere of warmth and quick passion.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Lang had just returned from a visit round the coast,
and reported all to be orderly and quiet where they had visited.</p>

<p>They all left the mission-house much impressed by the kindness of
the missionary, and his evident sincerity and faith in the cause for
which he and his wife had left the comforts of social intercourse and
friends at home to risk their lives in the work of raising the
natives of an, as yet, unwholesome country. They both appeared, like
the naturalist Graham, to be much debilitated by old attacks of
fever, yet, like him, hopeful, enthusiastic, and devoted to their
adopted land.</p>

<p>Their next call was at the store, where they saw the native cook
in his hammock; he was lying exhausted from his afternoon attack, and
regarded them with dull, expressionless eyes.</p>

<p>"Some day he will polish you off," observed Brown.</p>

<p>"No fear of that," responded the naturalist. He had lived in such
a constant atmosphere of death and violence for the past ten years
that he took these incidents coolly.</p>

<p>As they were looking over some birds of paradise and native
shields for sale, some young girls appeared at the door, looking in
with mischievous faces.</p>

<p>"Now then, get out of that!" shouted Graham, harshly, making a
rush at them, upon which they all ran away with merry bursts of
laughter. "Never saw such wanton hussies!" he muttered angrily,
coming back.</p>

<p>"The girls of Moresby are the same as all their sex; they know the
old man to be a regular woman-hater, and won't leave him alone,"
explained Brown to the others.</p>

<p>"Does he always treat the women that way?" asked Danby.</p>

<p>"Always; that's why he can go all over the land in perfect safety;
he is well known amongst the tribes, and the men can trust him
anywhere with their wives and daughters."</p>

<p>As they left the store-house one of the twin brothers Hawley rode
up on a white horse. They had lately imported a few horses to
Moresby, and they were taking kindly to the land, although the
natives viewed them with great awe and wonderment, and flocked out to
see them whenever they passed.</p>

<p>"Will you join us to-night, Mr. Hawley, with your brother?" asked
Brown.</p>

<p>"With pleasure, Mr. Brown; who are coming?"</p>

<p>"We are only going on the round with our invitations, and you are
the second, so I am glad you can come, for Mr. and Mrs. Lang have
declined, afraid to damp the party, I suppose, Mrs. Lang being the
only white lady in Moresby."</p>

<p>"Are you going to invite any of her Majesty's men?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll take your invite as I am going on board shortly
on business."</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>Through the village of Hanuabada they all went to the survey camp
at the other end; here they met Mr. C----and his party, just come in
from a hard day's work amongst the ants and underbush. Three of the
surveyors were down with fever, and the others burnt almost black
with the sun, and mopping their grimy wet faces and exposed chests.
The leader paused before giving his consent for the night.</p>

<p>"Remember, boys, you must be up at four o'clock to-morrow morning,
and we can't excuse headaches, now we are so short-handed."</p>

<p>"Let's go for an hour."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll come with you to see you all safe home."</p>

<p>Captain Mannville, like Mr. Lang, excused himself on the plea of
hard work, so together they made for the steamer once more.</p>

<p>On board they found the old skipper and Hans, the engineer, busy
washing old clothes, to make themselves respectable against the
occasion. They squatted on the deck, facing one another, with a
bucket of fresh water between them, scrubbing away at their greasy
trousers and shirts, and helping one another to wring them out.</p>

<p>In the cabin the steward and seamen were hard at work hanging up
old bunting and nailing croton-branches, making it as like a
conservatory as they could, while the upper decks were being mopped
down for the first time since leaving port.</p>

<p>The outside was lined with canoes and natives filling up the
water--barrels, &amp;c. They brought their supply in old rusty tanks
from the native wells ashore and handed it up in buckets; slow work,
but rendered a little faster by the multitude of workers. Their wages
were to be a stick of tobacco per day.</p>

<p>"Hello! what's the matter now?" yelled out the skipper from his
seat on the deck.</p>

<p>A sudden stoppage amongst the natives produced this query.</p>

<p>"They want part of their wages before they go on," replied the
Irish mate.</p>

<p>"Holy Moses! Why, they have only done half a day's work."</p>

<p>"And want their half-stick of tobacco," replied the mate.</p>

<p>It was a strike. The skipper got up with wild gestures and loud
words, but the natives stood in their canoes quietly, but obstinate,
with the tank half-emptied, refusing to work without being paid for
what they had done.</p>

<p>"There's no use bullying them," said Mr. Brown, "they have made up
their minds and nothing will make them move, except yielding to their
demands; your rag-tag appearance must have raised their
suspicions."</p>

<p>The poor old persecuted skipper sat down to his washing-tub with
the air of a martyr, while the steward brought out a bundle of
tobacco sticks, and went about dividing it amongst them, after which
they resumed their work as before.</p>

<p>"They will take these no trust fits occasionally," explained
Brown, "and then it is the very devil if you havn't got the
wherewithal to meet their demands. I remember once being left in the
lurch the same way amongst the Astrolabes, because I refused to give
way, thinking firmness was the best, and had to trudge back to the
coast alone and leave my baggage behind."</p>

<p>"Jolly awkward for an explorer."</p>

<p>"It is one of the difficulties with which we and all future
explorers will have to contend with in the discovery of this locked
land. A man has more chance with his gun and alone, without
provisions, than with a crowd. There is the Rev. James Chalmers, for
instance; he would set out on a voyage of discovery with three oars
and a single banana for provisions, trusting all the rest to
Providence or good luck, and is ready any day to do a
three-hundred-mile tramp up the country with only his walking-stick
and a pouch of tobacco, and I'll go bail that if any man is able to
cross this dark island, he is the one, with all his recklessness and
happy-go-lucky want of fore-thought."</p>

<p>Night comes, and the guests assemble. The warsloop is represented
by two junior officers, who come polite and stiff in full tropic
dress, and behave themselves as if in church for the honour of the
service. The days are gone by when junior officers were larky and
filled with monkey tricks; they are all now good boys and
well-behaved, with an eager eye after the main chances in life and a
thirst to study carefully all the byeways to promotion.</p>

<p>The survey party came like schoolboys let loose for an hour,
boisterous and much inclined for practical jokes. Their leader let
them do as they liked, while the champagne circulated, but put his
veto on the whisky, and told them to remember the morrow.</p>

<p>The Captain astonished all by appearing in a clean white shirt
which he had borrowed from Hans, and looking mightily unhappy in
it.</p>

<p>"Never thought you could look so much like a gentleman, old man,"
said Danby in a complimentary way, making room for the Captain beside
him at the table.</p>

<p>The one brother Hawley came before the other, and after dinner and
while Bowman was telling him something, he excused himself for a
moment and went outside. While still out the other entered, dressed
the same way, and sat down on the vacant seat, while Bowman continued
his story.</p>

<p>"But I don't quite comprehend."</p>

<p>"You know what I was telling you when you went out just now."</p>

<p>At this moment the right brother entered again, saying, "I say,
brother, you have taken my seat, make room. Yes, Bowman, and how did
you get on?"</p>

<p>Bowman had made the usual mistake, for the twins were exactly
alike.</p>

<p>It was a source of constant fun, like the "Comedy of Errors," with
the two brothers, and the party was a merry one before they broke
up.</p>

<p>The surveyors left first and much against their will, but their
leader was firm--business before pleasure. "Let us get the Laroke
road made and you can enjoy yourselves as much as you like," he
said.</p>

<p>The rest sat till daybreak, at which time the steam was put on and
the anchor weighed; the Captain had got rid of his uncomfortable
shirt, and now was once more in his element, turning round with loud
oaths in an old pair of pants and a buttonless under-flannel.</p>

<p>"Success to the Thunder."</p>

<p>The last toast is drunk, and they shake hands all round, while the
steam-whistle yells out for the third time; then natives skurry back
to their canoes and the shore-dwellers to their boats, as the stars
are getting dim in the growing light.</p>

<p>And out of the bay the little Hummer puffs, in her own peculiar
style, leaving the stifling huts and calm waters and silver-grey
hills behind them as they steer on their adventurous course to
unknown places in the west.</p>

<h3>Chapter XXXIII. A New River.</h3>

<p>Discovered by Mr. Tendin Beven, 1887.</p>

<p>THE Nora, Professor Killmann's little steam yacht, lies at anchor,
close to a shore where the banks are vast precipices towering fifteen
hundred feet over her masts and funnel, with vast forests of gigantic
trees growing on the tops.</p>

<p>The river is deep, wide, and rapidly flowing, so that where they
anchor they require strong chains to hold her stationary.</p>

<p>They have anchored early that afternoon because daylight is
quickly lost in these gloomy gorges, and they are ascending a river
never penetrated before by white people, so that they have to go
cautiously and feel their way as they go.</p>

<p>Professor Killmann is busy to-night amongst his specimens, with
his spirit-bottles ranged out on one side and his diary on the other,
in which he makes his entries from time to time when he has any fresh
remarks to make upon the natural specimens which he is
preserving.</p>

<p>At present he is engaged upon the skinning of a rare bird and has
his arsenic paste ready to his hand. A dirty job it is which has made
him take off his alpaca coat and roll up his shirt-sleeves.</p>

<p>On the couch near at hand are sitting Hector and Collins, engaged
in polishing up the steel work of their rifles and revolvers; they
are greatly recovered since leaving Ellangowan, and can both walk
about with only a slight limp. Niggeree is on deck taking charge of
the first watch and looking out for enemies.</p>

<p>"My friends, this new river is of much more importance than the
Fly, and I should not be astonished if it leads us right into the
centre of the country. Already we must be over a hundred miles from
the sea, and there seems no diminishing."</p>

<p>"How far up do you intend to go, Professor?" inquires Hector.</p>

<p>"Until the Nora can draw no more water."</p>

<p>"But our provisions are getting low."</p>

<p>"Then we must all have a day or two of hunting to replenish the
larder and increase my stock of specimens. What a blessing that the
natives, when in possession, left my bottles alone; they must have
thought them to be exploding machines."</p>

<p>"What do you think of the specimen which I showed you yesterday,
have you tried it yet?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, but it is not good. There is a little gold in it, but
iron is the principal ingredient, yet we will mark on my map the
latitude and longitude of your route after you left the river, as I
may visit the place some time; meantime I shall put your stone
amongst my specimens of minerals."</p>

<p>"No, Professor, with your leave, I'll stick to my bit of quartz,
it will do to remind me of our suffering."</p>

<p>"As you will, friend; I will let you have it when you like."</p>

<p>"Any time will do for that before we separate."</p>

<p>"You will have it--when we separate, my young friend."</p>

<p>Hector and Collins shortly after join their friend, Niggeree,
leaving the Professor to his preparing and classifying.</p>

<p>He makes some curious contortions of his face as he bends over his
bird, while the lamp lights it up, handling his knife with the
apparent delight of a vivisector, giving some demoniacal side-glares
now at his spirit bottles and now at his diary, while he mutters to
himself as he works,--</p>

<p>"Gold! yes, I would think the fool ought to have known it without
asking any one, but I must not let him tell any one else about his
discovery. Ah, I shall go over that swamp myself when I am rid of
them all."</p>

<p>He has finished his bird-curing, and now directs his attention to
some insects caught that day. They have been long enough immersed in
the spirits, and he now goes to work with his fine pins fixing them
to the empty frame. He stabs at them as they lie before him with a
grin of delight, which fairly twists his mouth under his long black
and silky beard.</p>

<p>A handsome man is the Professor, in spite of his sickly pallor,
with dark curly hair growing bare about the temples, full dark and
soft beard and moustache, a fine aquiline nose, and rich brown
eyes.</p>

<p>But he has a manner of moving his mouth and puckering his eyes
when he is interested in his task which is apt to make an onlooker
shudder.</p>

<p>"The explorer is a fool who would allow any white man to return
with him and share the honour of his discoveries. I shall have
discovered this river and found the gold when I reach civilization,
and these three friends of mine will have to stay behind, but at
present they are all useful. Well, Niggeree, how goes the night?"</p>

<p>"All quiet," said Niggeree, as he entered. "We have not had the
trouble on this river as yet that we had on the Fly."</p>

<p>"Not as yet."</p>

<p>"It's a bit tame, don't you think, sailing up, day after day,
without a change?"</p>

<p>"Change, Niggeree! What more would you have? We have discovered a
river never known to have had existence by white men; we have
fathomed the Aird, supposed to be a river hitherto, and have proved
it to be only one of many mouths of this grand fresh-water passage
hitherto unsuspected; but what of the Fly now when we look on this,
and think upon the scenery which we have already witnessed, besides
what may be in front--the splendid country we have passed through,
rich in soil, the sport we have had with our guns, the gigantic
forests, and the capital health we have all enjoyed since entering
upon this earthly paradise?"</p>

<p>"All that is good enough, but we have not seen a native yet, and
my Winchester is growing rusty."</p>

<p>"Ah! Niggeree, still the love of the big game. But surely you had
enough up the Fly this time. How you made them hop about at Snake
Point! I wager they have not often seen such an illumination about
that part as the night we got back our Nora. They will not forget us
this next monsoon."</p>

<p>"There ain't much left to remember us about that part of the
Alice."</p>

<p>"Enough to warn the rest for forty miles up the river to give us a
wide berth; but, Niggeree, you want some more excitement?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Professor, I'd like something of a change."</p>

<p>"So you shall, my friend. To-morrow, at the next gully we come to,
or cleft inland of this wall, I intend to land and explore it a bit,
but I want you and I to go alone."</p>

<p>"Why you and I?" asked Niggeree, in a suspicious tone--he had not
too much faith in his friend.</p>

<p>"Why? Look at this, my friend, first."</p>

<p>The Professor went over to his small chest of drawers which stood
in a corner, where he kept his chemicals and medicines, and returning
with the specimen of quartz which Hector had given him to test,
placed it in Niggeree's hand, watching him while he examined it by
the lamp-light.</p>

<p>"Three parts gold, by the great Harry! This was not found in New
Guinea?"</p>

<p>"Hector says be found it in the hill where the Malays left him and
Collins."</p>

<p>"Loose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and only one piece of many."</p>

<p>"Then what the devil are we doing here when the gold lies over
there?"</p>

<p>"Gently, my friend; we know where to find it when we want it over
there--you and I--but we need not bring all Queensland upon our
trail."</p>

<p>"Ah! you want to get rid of them first?"</p>

<p>"That is it, and you will help me. Besides, if it has been found
there, may it not be also here--this here is a likely country."</p>

<p>"The same thought has struck me once or twice to day; the rocks do
look gold-bearing."</p>

<p>"It is in the gullies we must look, friend; but say nothing. We
will go on our collecting expedition together, and leave them behind
on guard."</p>

<p>As Niggeree left the cabin he said to himself, "Yes, my
smooth--tongued chum, and I'll take good care not to let you get
behind me when we are on that ere expedition."</p>

<p>Professor Killmann looked after him with an indulgent smile, and
muttered softly, "He is going upstairs to find out all that he can
about the locality of that mountain from Hector, so that he may go
alone after that gold. Ah! well, he is welcome to all the knowledge
he is able to glean to--night, but he is very innocent for a native
of the sunny isles of Greece."</p>

<p>This is the twelfth day since the Nora picked up Hector and
Collins at Ellengowan.</p>

<p>They had only stayed long enough to assist the poor missionaries
to erect a shelter for their families, which, with the help of the
natives, they were not long in doing; then they gave them what they
could spare in the shape of provisions--a couple of bags of flour,
one bag of rice, some tins of preserved beef, tea and sugar, over
which they made loud demonstrations of gratitude.</p>

<p>Collins and Hector promised to send them more when they got their
vessel to Sabai, if they found it had not been molested meantime by
unfriendly visitors.</p>

<p>"Poor fellows!" he said, as they sailed away. "Their ideas of
religion may be right or wrong, but there is no question about the
sacrifices they make. They are allowed twenty pounds a year, and have
no notion of the value of money, so that they order all sorts of
rubbish and spend it in a month or so, and often would starve if it
was not for the kindness and charity of their countrymen, the divers
of Torres Straits--reckless devils they are, these Kanaka divers: but
I know of more than one of my own lads who have handed me over forty
pounds at a time out of their wages to send over to their starving
missionary brothers in New Guinea; damn fools, they call them, to go
over there to die on starvation wages. But they come here to die, and
seem to glory in it, for they have always fresh recruits eager to
fill the places of the murdered men from the South Seas."</p>

<p>They passed down the river with the ordinary incidents--hostile
natives showing up and being frightened away, a little relaxation
ashore with the gun getting game, sultry days and watchful
nights.</p>

<p>At Kiwai Island Niggeree left the Sunflower, in care of one or two
of his boys, with orders to take it on to Moresby and wait his coming
when the monsoon changed to the west.</p>

<p>Then they went in the Nora to the mouth of the river named after
Collins, and, luckily, found the Coral Seas as they had left her. The
Professor made a chart of the river from their directions, after
which they towed her back to Kiwai, where the lads were left to patch
up her helm, and take her also back to Moresby with the
Sunflower.</p>

<p>"I'll try the mouth of the Collins for shells by-and-by," observed
the master of the Coral Seas.</p>

<p>"I'll join you in that," said Niggeree.</p>

<p>They coasted round from Mibu, keeping close to the shore, until
they got to the mouth of the Aird River, as marked in the chart.</p>

<p>"There's a good broad channel here," observed Killmann. "What say
you, friends, if we try it up a little?"</p>

<p>All on board agreed, time being of little object to any of them,
so they put in without pausing.</p>

<p>They lost about three days dodging backward and forward, trying
different channels and finding no apparent passage inland, or getting
grounded on mud-banks.</p>

<p>At last, when they were about to despair of being able to
penetrate it, they almost accidentally struck the right mouth of the
main river, and found it a most magnificent stream, over half a mile
broad, with a steady tide and plenty of bottom, up which they boldly
steamed straight on to the mountain ranges.</p>

<p>They passed banks such as they had never witnessed before for
fertility and richness of soil, without meeting either natives or
mosquitoes. It was a wholesome and dry land, and seemed specially
adapted for future colonists, so that their health improved almost
every hour; the water was fresh and pure, and the place seemed
unoccupied by man, for the game were very plentiful and tame, proving
that they had not been much hunted.</p>

<p>Then, after the fallow agriculatural flats, they came to mountain
ranges, a most magnificent vista of highlands densely covered with
forests of mighty cedar and other trees--in the far distance great
peaks towering up, blue and picturesque, towards which they steamed
swiftly with many a twist and curve, yet still going easterly and
northward.</p>

<p>Then they got into the mountain chain, the river still cleaving
its way, smooth and rapid, between vast chasms; a constant changing
of earth's features as the mighty panorama grew vaster about them and
grander. They passed beetling cliffs with great rifts and gullies,
down which the roaring waters rushed to feed this river, gleaming
white and tumultuous as the sunshafts slid down the mountain sides
and struck upon them.</p>

<p>They could see great distances away, when the landscape at times
opened up, showing lofty peaks, towering above the dense forests all
blue against the ambient sky; they beheld the fresh-green tints of
the nearer ranges, and got glimpses of fairy-like valleys,
plentifully watered, and which served as sheltered homes for
countless herds of kangaroos and cassowaries, as the forests were the
thronged mansions of the birds.</p>

<p>Not a shower had yet fallen over this land of unused plenty, yet
the torrents flowed ceaselessly over the crags and past the roots of
clustering parasites and gigantic tree roots: these waters, with the
rivers, made the air cool even in the fierce mid-day heat, while at
times they passed through an unbroken twilight of balmy shadow, where
the walls of rocks rose hundreds of feet above their heads, with the
great branches and umbrella-like leaves spreading far beyond the tops
and highest of all ran narrow lanes of deep blue sky.</p>

<p>It was a region of delicious surprises.</p>

<h3>Chapter XXXIV. A Prospecting Expedition.</h3>

<p>AT daybreak next morning the Nora was once more under way, and
before very long they had come abreast of one of the many natural
rifts or gullies which split, in a zigzag fashion, the mountain
through which they were penetrating. These gullies were doubtless the
effect of a series of eruptions and earthquakes in the unknown past,
rounded off by countless centuries of water-wearing. A mighty crack
this rift looked like from the deck of the Nora, with huge strata
exposed in irregular confusion like the blasted sides of a
long-disused quarry, covered up in parts by vegetation where the
layers or accumulations of d&eacute;bris allowed vegetation to take
root and flourish in that prolific warmth of atmosphere.</p>

<p>In the valley of this gorge a vast assemblage of great boulders
and stones were scattered about, making a series of waterfalls and
foam swirlings as the stream leapt over the high places or twisted
about the separate rocks and stones, glittering snow-like where the
forenoon sun--rays fell down upon them, and looking cool grey in the
violet shadow.</p>

<p>They could look up this glen for about half a mile only, by reason
of its turnings. The morning haze still hung, gauze-like, over it,
and gave to it a fairy-like look of light, particularly as from every
bough and division of leafage seemingly hung thick hammock clusters
of spider-webs, swinging from glistening threads like glass-blown
fibres stretched out and interlaced in the open spaces.</p>

<p>A soft, suggestive picture all this, after the first framing of
boulders and greenage in the direct foreground! The scene melted away
into light tones of purple and warm greys, with the dew-hung webs
like filigree--work done in frosted silver and with polished edges;
the whole seemed alight with blazing diamonds.</p>

<p>The Professor had in a way explained his intentions to Hector and
Collins, appointing them to guard the vessel during his absence
ashore; and as it was quite a customary thing for some one or other
to take these occasional excursions, they felt no surprise now.</p>

<p>Niggeree came up from his berth with his customary complement of
war implements at his belt, a brace of Colt's revolvers, with a bag
of spare cartridges, a small cutlass, and, slung over his back, his
fifteen chambered Winchester; he was going ashore with his friend and
seemingly thought it well to be prepared against the occasion.</p>

<p>"Don't you think, friend, that you are somewhat heavily equipped,
considering the hard climbing before us?" said the Professor, who
contented himself with a single revolver and a small sheath dagger.
He carried in his hand a light geological hammer.</p>

<p>"So long as I don't grumble at the weight of my baggage, you
needn't," responded Niggeree in a surly tone.</p>

<p>Another moment, and they stepped ashore a few yards from the mouth
of the stream, and had begun their march.</p>

<p>The Professor went first, with Niggeree a few yards behind. With
his usual politeness he had offered to the Greek the precedence,
which, however, the other declined, and so they passed on their way
into the haze, wending round the boulders where they could, and
climbing over others which they could not avoid.</p>

<p>For the first few yards, owing to the intense sultriness of this
breathless hour of day, a frightful sense of oppression weighed upon
their limbs, the veins rose upon their arms, and their heads throbbed
as if they would burst, while their skin burned with a dry fever and
seemed to be distended and prickling all over--a moment or so of
intensest agony, then instant relief as the perspiration broke from
every pore, saturating their light flannels; they could now toil on
with ease and comfort.</p>

<p>A fatiguing journey from the beginning, even while the defile was
open enough to allow them room for climbing along its margin, but
increasing in difficulty as they advanced, for the stream rushed
close to the sides of abrupt cliffs and wall-like precipices, so that
it became a constant struggle, either with the current, which,
although shallow, swirled about their legs with a force almost enough
to draw their feet from under them, or else with the rough rocks
which they clung to as they clambered over the many different leaps
which the torrent took in its tumultuous passage down.</p>

<p>They could not speak much to one another as they struggled on, the
noise of rushing water filling their ears; besides there was the
necessity of saving their breath for the labour of climbing.</p>

<p>"Tough work!" observed the Professor, getting astride a large
stone and resting for a moment.</p>

<p>"Rather!" responded Niggeree, taking a perch on another mass of
rock close by, and wiping his brow with the back of his hand.</p>

<p>They had reached a part of the ravine where the Nora was shut out
by a turn of the overhanging cliffs. Above rose walls some hundred
feet in air, with trees at the summit meeting from both sides and
shutting out the sky. Before them lay nearly sixty yards of
comparatively level stream, with another small cataract of about six
or eight feet, terminating their line of sight with the same rugged
background of broken up rock and bush.</p>

<p>At their feet lay a deep sleeping pool of bistretinted water,
protected from the general rushing current by some immense basaltic
boulders which had fallen over one another and made a kind of bay. It
would require an energetic spring to get from their present rest to
the next mass close to the stream.</p>

<p>As they sat silently resting and looking down they could see yards
below the surface, but not far enough to reach the bottom.</p>

<p>"A good spot for a bath, friend, don't you think?" said the
Professor.</p>

<p>"If there is nothing besides water there;--let's try," replied
Niggeree, and, suiting the action to the word, he broke off a small
piece of dry wood near at hand and cast it downwards.</p>

<p>Instantly a commotion took place in the pool, at which Niggeree
brought his rifle to the point.</p>

<p>"I thought so," he observed, firing off quickly a couple of
charges as the long snout of an immense alligator darted up; "I have
spoilt that fellow's idea of fun."</p>

<p>The still water became in a moment like a whirlpool, dashing up
against the sides of the rock and becoming stained with a ruddy tint,
shortly to subside as the great body slowly rose to the surface and
floated belly upwards, with the short legs and claws outstretched and
bent.</p>

<p>"Not the safest bath in the world, Professor!"</p>

<p>As they still looked upon the carcass two great jaws appeared by
its side, gaping and closing with a snap upon the dead body, and in
another instant it was dragged below the surface.</p>

<p>"That's the proper way to use a dead mate;--it's the old boy's
wife, I expect, taking him down for the young one's dinner."</p>

<p>"Nature is very merciless," responded the Professor gravely.</p>

<p>"Nature don't like anything to be wasted, you mean," retorted the
Greek. "He's no more good in the way o' love, but he isn't bad to
eat, so good luck to the female who can make the most of her husband
while she has anything of him."</p>

<p>On again they went, scrambling through the water and up the sides
of stones, until after about an hour they had reached a part where
occurred another diverse rift which seemed to stretch into the heart
of the mountains to the right, while the stream led onward towards
the left.</p>

<p>Between them and this aperture rose a sheer wall of rock of about
twenty feet in height, cracked and ridged in all directions.</p>

<p>"I should like to see what lies beyond this wall if we can get
over it," said the Professor. So, after taking a breath, they at once
began to climb.</p>

<p>A much harder task than any they had yet attempted this proved to
be, for, at the best, they could only insert their toes and fingers
between the crevices, and had to feel for the next crack while
clinging on with all their strength.</p>

<p>It was a task which only determined men and good climbers would
attempt. Both got out their knives, digging them in where they could,
and holding on while with their feet they frantically and blindly
struggled for a footing, with their muscles straining and veins
starting out with the effort.</p>

<p>A few feet would be gained, then the knives would give way, and
back they would fall against the boulders which were scattered about
the bottom.</p>

<p>Niggeree was the surest footed, and, after many a slip, managed to
reach the top, and clutch hold of an overhanging branch with which he
drew himself up, even as the Professor made his fifth slip and now
lay on his back looking up helplessly.</p>

<p>"Chuck me up your belt, Professor, and I'll fasten it to mine and
be able to reach you," cried Niggeree from the top.</p>

<p>The Professor unfastened his leather belt, and pitched it up, with
which Niggeree hooking the two together, and holding on to the branch
leaned over, reaching to within four feet of where he now stood.</p>

<p>Another scramble up, and he catches hold of the end dangling near
him, and then slowly works his way up to where the Greek lay.</p>

<p>"A stern pull, friend, and I hope we have no more of that
work."</p>

<p>"So do I," panted Niggeree, as he unfastened the belts, and put
his on again.</p>

<p>They were now inside a dried-up watercourse, composed of loose
sand and brownish-looking basaltic boulders of all sizes and shapes,
some lying detached and rounded, while others were piled against each
other like rounded castle-walls.</p>

<p>The sides of the mountain were of the same character, great walls
split up as if by earthquakes, with dark fissures opening up, half
concealed by dense masses of foliage, knarled trunks, and roots
wreathed about the stones like vast snakes.</p>

<p>The sunlight poured over the place where they stood, but further
on the beetling cliffs seemed to meet over-head, and to close in the
passage.</p>

<p>The gully led upwards towards this dark vista at a steep incline,
so that as they stood they reckoned themselves to be over three
hundred feet above the river.</p>

<p>"Friend Niggeree, if there is gold to be found in this land it
ought to be here, let us pause and examine."</p>

<p>The Professor bent down, and passing his hand amongst the sand
raked it up; as he turned over the first few handfuls, the Greek
watched them filtering down.</p>

<p>As it ran between his fingers the sunshine, streaming over it,
flashed on a number of minute specks.</p>

<p>"I thought so, my friend, it is here for the washing; let us
follow up the course, and see where it has been sent from."</p>

<p>They went along slowly after this, turning over stones out of
which scrambled many a strange insect monster--centipedes, white and
deadly-looking, scorpions, which waddled away like crabs; they paid
little heed to the alteration of scenery in their eager watching of
the ground.</p>

<p>At times the Professor became diverted in his gold searching when
some new species of the insect world was exposed; at these times he
got out his case from his knapsack and paused to secure the prize,
Niggeree going on it front.</p>

<p>At one of these pauses, he looked up to see the other a good way
ahead; an evil gleam came into his dark eyes as he saw this, while he
muttered,--</p>

<p>"Ah! you are eager to find the gold for me, my friend; the
alligator is a good precedent."</p>

<p>Niggeree had swooped suddenly down at that instant, picking
something up, and with a half-glance behind, stuffed it hurriedly
into his pocket.</p>

<p>"What have you found?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Niggeree, going on, and kicking at the stones
as he went.</p>

<p>They had now come to a part of the gully where the rocks seemed to
close a couple of hundred feet above them, shutting out the daylight,
and leaving before them a vast, cavern-like aperture.</p>

<p>A gloomy, Dantesque scene, with columns--masses of rock piled
up--and long rope-like roots of trees dangling down from the crevices
above and running along the ground until they found a hole in the
earth below.</p>

<p>They seemed to face one of the gateways to the Inferno.</p>

<p>The daylight penetrated for some yards inside over the rugged
sides of the walls and the confused masses all around. Beyond that,
deep impenetrable blackness lead into the centre of the mountain.</p>

<p>"We must get a light."</p>

<p>Niggeree with his knife cut off a length or two of the dry roots,
and gathering some of the scrubby, sun-bleached bushes which
clustered about their feet, carried them into the cavern mouth.</p>

<p>Then he bent down and struck a match, and set the wood on
fire.</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>He started back as he spoke, and looked into the darkness, as a
loud hissing broke on the silence.</p>

<p>"Snakes!"</p>

<p>Along the floor glided an enormous serpent, not less than twenty
feet.</p>

<p>As it rose to face them Niggeree fired his Winchester, blowing the
head right off and raising a thousand echoes, which vibrated along
for about five minutes until lost in extreme distance, while at the
report a perfect cloud of bats and flying-foxes hurried out, with
dazed eyes, and casting down an avalanche of dust, which drove the
two explorers into the open, coughing and choking.</p>

<p>"Are you going any further?" asked the Greek, as he recovered
himself.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my friend, this looks like an adventure."</p>

<p>"And tastes like one also," replied the other, spitting on the
ground.</p>

<p>The firewood was blazing up inside by this time, and glaring up
the sides of the walls, while they could hear the sounds of legions
of bats retreating backwards.</p>

<p>As the Professor spoke Niggeree went forward and held his links of
roots to the flames, where they quickly caught fire, and sputtered as
he held them.</p>

<p>"There's your torch for you; let us cut some more down and go
on."</p>

<p>Each secured a bundle of root-ends, and holding the lighted one,
pushed forward.</p>

<p>"I hope there is no more of that chap's family about," said
Niggeree, as they went on.</p>

<p>"Try to get the next one whole if you can," replied the Professor,
thinking more upon his specimens than the danger.</p>

<p>Onward through the blackness, only dimly lighted up, they went,
tripping over stones and running against bigger masses, sometimes
having to leap across ugly fissures which yawned across their path,
yet never thinking about the going back, impelled by the curiosity
natural to explorers to see what lay in front.</p>

<p>The upper portion was lost in darkness, as the links only served
to illuminate a few yards round them.</p>

<p>They have lighted fresh links, which are resinous and easily kept
alight.</p>

<p>For about a mile and a half they went on, when all at once the
ground took a sudden dip, into which they stumbled before they were
aware and dropped simultaneously upon their knees, groping eagerly in
the darkness for their links, which had both fallen from their hands
and lay sputtering amongst the sand.</p>

<p>"Quick, the matches," cried the Professor, in an impressive voice.
And Niggeree strikes a match and once more sets fire to the
torches.</p>

<p>"Ah! gold at last."</p>

<p>Yes, it was there unmistakably, in dust and water-worn nuggets, as
much as they could wallow amongst, washed into this natural pocket or
depression of the ground by some far-distant watercourse, and cleaned
from the d&eacute;bris, which had been driven further down.</p>

<p>A natural cradle in some mighty past. The accumulations of ages
had been forced into it from the earth above and swirled about by the
dashing water until the heavy lumps and grains had been deposited
clean at the bottom, while the flood bore the lighter dirt out of the
water-worn basin; it lay clean and to their hand, to lift and carry
away as they could.</p>

<p>The two men for the first few moments looked at the treasure with
stupified eyes, oblivious to one another and all around them; they
seemed as if they were alone in that place and unconscious of each
other.</p>

<p>Round them the great blackness hung, which the two torches, now
stuck upright amongst that glittering dust, hardly lighted, the two
men stood with flaming cheeks and lips apart.</p>

<p>Gold more than enough for twenty men, more than they could carry
away in forty journeys!</p>

<p>And out of the darkness in front came a dull roaring, which
neither of them heard in their excitement, the roaring of water
falling from a great height and into a vast depth; the muffled roar
of a subterranean waterfall.</p>

<p>With a gasp Niggeree awoke, and began to stuff his trousers
pockets and inside his shirt with the precious rubbish.</p>

<p>"Hold!" cried the Professor, darting forward and seizing him. "It
is my discovery--it is all mine!"</p>

<p>"What! you cursed thief, ain't I to have my share?" And Niggeree
caught the Professor by the throat.</p>

<p>"No, only one can claim this prize."</p>

<p>"Then I'm the prize-holder," cried the Greek; and in a frenzy they
both closed with one another.</p>

<p>They were both powerful men, well matched, and both for the time
madmen.</p>

<p>It is no uncommon frenzy, this gold fever. Once a friend of mine
coming to England had as a fellow-passenger a lucky miner. He had
converted his pile into sovereigns, which he wore constantly round
his body in a belt; sleeping and waking he never took it off. One
day, near the tropics, they saw him come on deck and take his belt
off, which he opened, and deliberately poured the contents overboard,
afterwards jumping after them.</p>

<p>Another digger, one of three who had been working a hole for
months, drew to the surface a large nugget; he looked at it a moment,
and then dived down the hole, breaking his neck at the bottom.</p>

<p>They were both well matched as far as strength lay, but Niggeree
was hampered by his Winchester and his weight of gold-dust, which got
into his way and tripped him up as they wrestled and fought
together.</p>

<p>Now up, now down, rolling amongst the riches, they had fallen over
the links and stamped them out, so that it was a battle in the
dark.</p>

<p>Out of the gold vein and backward they struggled towards that
sound of roaring water, with their ears filled with curses as they
hit at one another and rolled about.</p>

<p>Niggeree is under now, and the Professor has got him by the
throat--closer--he is gasping for breath, and his hands slightly
relax.</p>

<p>With an effort they are both on their feet, but the Professor has
not relaxed his mastiff grip.</p>

<p>"Ha!" The Professor gives his enemy a sudden pitch forward and he
is free, standing waiting on the next attack from his unseen
enemy.</p>

<p>But Niggeree does not come again, and the Professor collects
himself and listens intently. Niggeree has the matches with him, so
that the Professor cannot strike a light.</p>

<p>Then he hears that sound of rushing waters, and a great horror
comes over him as he listens.</p>

<p>What is it? He drops on his hands and knees and goes forward in
that fashion, feeling carefully one hand before another as he
creeps.</p>

<p>Three hand-lengths it is a solid and smooth water-worn rock,
inclining slightly upwards from the gold bed; but at the fourth
stretch his hand suddenly dips down into vacancy, while upward float
cold spray--vapours, which chill his very soul as they damp his
tangled hair and soft beard.</p>

<h3>Chapter XXXV. Return of the Professor.</h3>

<p>HECTOR and Collins, from the deck of the Nora, watched the forms
of the two excursionists as they passed up the glen and disappeared
into the hazy atmosphere; then with a look up and down the river,
settled themselves for a comfortable forenoon smoke and talk
together.</p>

<p>They did not anticipate much danger from natives, as they had
nearly persuaded themselves by this time that this portion of the
land was uninhabited, as they had not seen hitherto the slightest
indication of human life--no vestige of smoke or gardens, not a
single banana leaf breaking upon the general tree-covered hills,
always the signal of natives.</p>

<p>The men on board had all been imported from the two schooners,
Killmann's original crew having entirely disappeared. The Chinaman,
who acted as cook, came from the galley of the Sunflower, while the
others were Malays and South-Sea Islanders, Malays mostly, and all
familiar with and attached to their temporary masters.</p>

<p>They did not, however, relax in vigilance, although free from
anxiety, every man having his loaded weapon to his hand if wanted,
and as they swung their legs over the gunwale it was seldom that an
instant passed without some glance sweeping their surroundings.</p>

<p>From the galley wafted apetizing perfumes of roasting flesh, while
from the engine-room rose occasionally an aroma of machine-oil not
quite so agreeable.</p>

<p>"I tell you what, mate," observed Collins slowly between his
whiffs, "I don't much mind when this exploring of the Professor's
comes to an end, and we get once more back to our own diving
operations. I don't care much for either of the two gone together up
that ere gully, but of the two I'd rather have Nig."</p>

<p>"They are both bad nuts."</p>

<p>"None worse, when they get a fair show; but of the two, Nig is
most to be trusted. He don't muddle amongst them poison pastes and
undrinkable spirits, he's rougher and more like his trade, and you
know pretty well when he's on the job; but the other, with his
friendship here and friendship there, puts me always in mind of
Lucretia Borger."</p>

<p>"Oh, we are pretty safe, he has no call to get us out of his way,"
replied Hector.</p>

<p>"I ain't so sure o' that, mate, with that discovery o' yours over
there."</p>

<p>"He tells me it's useless."</p>

<p>"If he tells ye that, believe the direct opposite. By the Lord,
Hector, I never thought you had found gold until this moment, now I
do."</p>

<p>"So do I, in spite of his telling me the contrary."</p>

<p>"Whar's your specimen?"</p>

<p>"The Professor has it, but promises to give it me when we part
company."</p>

<p>"Did he offer it ye, or did you ask for it?"</p>

<p>"I asked him for it; he wanted to put it amongst his curios."</p>

<p>"Then see that ye get it, mate; and take my tip, look alive again
parting time; we hain't said good-bye yet to the Professor."</p>

<p>"We must both look up to time, I reckon, then. This new river
discovery is worse for us than the gold finding, the Professor don't
like to share his finds with white people."</p>

<p>"Tell you the truth, mate, only that they gave us a hand, and that
I would not do a mean action, I'd up steam and cut now, while they
are ashore, I would if it wasn't for that and old friendship for
Nig."</p>

<p>"No! we must stick to our post whatever happens, only we'll watch
his movements. Besides, we are always three to one, for Nig will side
with us, and the boys are all our own on board; he'd try the lot of
us if he tried one," said Hector.</p>

<p>"Still, I'm almost afeard he may dose us."</p>

<p>"No fear, Johnny will see to that, he is the man most afraid on
board, of the Professor; he knows how the last Chinaman went, and
don't sleep much when the other is awake."</p>

<p>"Carolina Joe now is a mate worth calling a mate. I reckon him
true as yourself, Hector, when he gives a mate his paw."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is as white a man as we have in these seas, but Nig will
do, so long as ye don't go dead agin him."</p>

<p>The Chinaman glided forward at this moment.</p>

<p>"Dinireb, skippels, am on de tably."</p>

<p>"All right, Johnny, and we can do it."</p>

<p>"Skippels, me hear de Plofesshy man muttat to himself muchly last
night and lookly uncommon ugly when no on nealey."</p>

<p>"And what do you 'spect, John."</p>

<p>"Niggly no come back to-day, and den Plofesshy go for you."</p>

<p>"We'll look out for that, John, boy."</p>

<p>"Me lookly uncommon libely also."</p>

<p>They both rose and went into the cabin, the Chinaman following
after to act as steward.</p>

<p>"Fishly belly good, me caught him last night."</p>

<p>The fish was discussed and found excellent.</p>

<p>Some blue pigeons came after, dressed &agrave; la Chinois, that is
chopped up bones and all, after which they had some roast wild
pig.</p>

<p>"Me no cookly the paladisely bild Plofesshy skinned last night, me
nclel cook what Plofesshy skin, chuck him ovleybold unless Plofesshy
want to eat him himself."</p>

<p>"You are mighty suspicious, John, about the Professor."</p>

<p>"John know Plofesshy, dat all 'bout it."</p>

<p>Both men laughed at John's conclusion, and rose to get their
pipes.</p>

<p>"Canoes coming round bend," laconically shouted out Jack the Malay
from his place on deck, which made them both dart to the door.</p>

<p>Yes, at last they were to see what they had almost given up.</p>

<p>Three, fishing canoes apparently, two with women inside, and the
third containing a couple of natives and half a dozen of boys.</p>

<p>"Oh, we needn't bother much about that lot," said Collins
indifferently, going back for his pipe.</p>

<p>The natives had not at first seen the Nora as they floated down
the stream, but now the appalling sight burst upon them when they
were nearly opposite it, and with loud exclamations of surprise and
fear they paused on their paddles.</p>

<p>Yet, on the whole, they seemed much less shy when viewing white
men for the first time than many natives whom the two friends had
been amongst, and after shouting the Moresby dialect to them, "Mai!
Mai!" several times they appeared to comprehend that the strangers
were friends and meant "peace," for the canoe with the men came very
close and waited for the next advance.</p>

<p>Eventually, after proffering several articles, such as beads,
gaudy bits of cotton, sticks of tobacco (it was like luring on a bird
that you wish to capture) the men handed the wares over the ship's
sides, which were taken by the male natives and given over on the
blades of their paddles to the women who took possession of them. The
full act of friendship was consummated when Collins passed over a
handful of salt; the men tasted, first doubtfully, then eagerly,
handing over a very small share to the women, who no sooner tasted it
than they at once impulsively paddled over to the side with pleased
grimaces, holding up their hands for the rope which was cast to them
to lift them aboard.</p>

<p>The day is waning before the treaty is quite concluded, but now
they are all squatted on deck telling the two friends, in a language
from which they can distinguish as nearly approaching the Motu
dialect, that their village is near at hand up in a valley about four
miles from where they are anchored, and that they are not so numerous
as they were owing to a very powerful and savage tribe which occupy
the mountains.</p>

<p>"Are they also near at hand?" inquired Collins.</p>

<p>"Oh no, they live several days' march distant, but come down
sometimes on a marauding expedition, and then we have to fly."</p>

<p>"You like Kiki?" asked Collins, pointing to his own arm as he
spoke.</p>

<p>"No! no!" with motions of disgust. "The hill fellows kill and
eat."</p>

<p>As they are still conversing, a distant shot fired in the gully
attracts their notice.</p>

<p>"By Jove, that is our party, and in danger. Quick, boys, let us go
ashore and help them."</p>

<p>Hector decides to stay on board to look after the ship, so
Collins, taking his revolver and guns, while the two natives offer to
accompany him and three of the Malays, row over to the water-edge and
leap ashore.</p>

<p>"Keep the boat ready here when we come back," says Collins to one
of the boys, while the four others follow him as he rushes up the
glen.</p>

<p>Two more revolver reports, nearer at hand, greet their ears as
they approach the bend of the rocks and then they are round it, and
can see the Professor staggering towards them with his shirt torn
from his back, hatless and ghastly.</p>

<p>Is this the same man who left them that morning, whom they rush
forward to lift up? He has stumbled forward on his face, and they can
see a couple of arrows protruding from his back.</p>

<p>His curly hair looks bleached and grey, and when Collins lifts him
up, the face is pinched like the face of an old man.</p>

<p>"Killmann! Rouse up, old fellow."</p>

<p>The Professor opens his lids for a moment, staring wildly at
Collins, then, even as he tries to speak, falls back in a swoon.</p>

<p>"Look out, Boss," cries one of the Malays, and Collins is on his
feet once more to see a dark band of savage-looking gigantic men
swarming over the rocks.</p>

<p>"Fire, boys, steady," cries the leader, and the three rifles pour
out their deadly contents, bringing down an equal number of the
advancing crowd, and causing the others to fall back for a moment,
while the two friendly natives bend their heads and put their fingers
into their ears.</p>

<p>Collins beckons to the natives to lift the prostrate man and carry
him on before them, and both being tall fellows stoop and pick him up
at once, and between them begin the retreat towards the boat, while
the three armed men once more face the enemy and cover the others, as
they struggle over the uneven ground.</p>

<p>The two friendly natives were tall fellows, with good-tempered
faces and light-coloured skins, differing in this respect from the
enemy who were more like negroes than the ordinary type of Papuans.
As they stooped to lift up the unconscious Professor, they gently
took hold of the arrow ends between their fingers, and broke them off
near to the wounds, but did not attempt to pull them out.</p>

<p>Although expressing great fear of their enemies when they first
appeared, as they saw the effect of the shots they lost all sense of
apprehension, and went along intent only upon their burden, without
looking behind and evincing an utter trust in the master white man to
have power to protect them, when he had such tremendous powers at his
command to destroy.</p>

<p>How numerous the opposing forces were, they had no means of
calculating, as only a few of the foremost had as yet fully appeared
over the rocks, but before they sank from sight they had a view of
the topknots from many a woolly mop for a considerable distance up
the glen, as they hurried down to join their comrades in the
front.</p>

<p>A few moments of silence followed after the first volley, during
which pause the natives managed to get their burden round the corner,
then Collins, with a parting volley, aimed at whatever the rocks did
not cover, turned quickly to follow.</p>

<p>A shower of arrows at once whistled from behind the rocks, falling
far short of the men retreating.</p>

<p>When they reached the bend they could see that the two natives
were striding along half-way to the boat in which the Malay
waited.</p>

<p>"Hold firm here till they get him down, then make a run for
it."</p>

<p>The savages seeing them run had made a rush after them, but upon
this sudden halt they shrank back, and seemed inclined to turn tail.
However, when they had paused irresolute the ground was comparatively
clear, so that those in front could find no shelter to get behind,
while the others in the rear were pressing on, and unable to
retreat.</p>

<p>The Papuan will run when he can, but if that is impossible, he
will fight as desperately as the bravest: it is in moments of
emergency such as this that the brute courage seems to rise superior
to his natural timidity at this strange mode of warfare.</p>

<p>The rifle was a mystery to him, and mystery ever demoralizes
mankind.</p>

<p>But now that there was no escape, their irresolution was only
momentary, and with a blood-curdling yell they came on again at a
run, the rocks behind seeming to disgorge dark figures, which swarmed
over their tops and leaped down into the rushing stream.</p>

<p>"Fire as fast as you can and bolt, they have reached the
boat."</p>

<p>Thirteen shots from the Winchester at Collins' shoulder, and two
from the Malay double barrels surrounded them with a veil of smoke,
under which they turned and ran, loading as they did so.</p>

<p>Another stand and volley half-way down, as through the clearing
vapours they could see the indistinct figures, and hear the appalling
yells and shrieks. Then the next run brought them to the boat, into
which they all sprang, and pushed off.</p>

<p>"Fire from the deck," shouted Collins to Hector, as they pulled
round the stern, so as to place the Nora between them and the enemy
till they could get on board.</p>

<p>"Aim anywhere, you're sure to hit something, for they are as thick
as gooseberries."</p>

<p>Hector and the boys on board blazed away as directed, while
Collins clambered up the sides and bent over to help up the wounded
man.</p>

<p>"Up with the anchor, and draw off a bit," ordered Hector, as he
loaded once more, and watched the smoke clearing.</p>

<p>The anchor is up, and they draw across the stream with their stern
towards the gully.</p>

<p>"Pitch a charge from the big gun into them."</p>

<p>A blind aim was directed straight inwards, and fired with a
thundrous din, which caused the friendly natives, male and female, to
fall flat on their faces, and lie there trembling till the smoke had
rolled away.</p>

<p>Then they saw the savages who were not shot, gathered about the
water's edge, gesticulating wildly and impotently towards them, while
further in were dark figures lying in all positions still, or trying
vainly to raise themselves from the ground and the dashing shallow
stream, which flowed over them as they lay.</p>

<h3>Chapter XXXVI. White Gods.</h3>

<p>"ARROWS poisoned, and too far in; white man will not live."</p>

<p>This was the verdict given by three of the elder women as they
rose up after examining the Professor, whom they had laid upon the
aft-deck with his hair mattress under him, while the younger females
and children stood round with sympathetic faces.</p>

<p>"Take out the arrows, and let us try what we can do."</p>

<p>"No, he will die at once if the arrows are pulled out; him live
till to--morrow this time if they are left in."</p>

<p>They were slowly steaming up the river while this consultation was
going on, the natives completely at their ease with their white
friends, and eager to carry the surprising news of a victory over
their old enemies home, along with the great strangers who had come
to help them.</p>

<p>Killmann they had not seen before, and regarded him as an
outsider. It was towards Collins and Hector that their hero-worship
was extended, whom they regarded with their repeating rifles to be
invincible.</p>

<p>There are no gods in New Guinea, yet here was something which came
as nearly up to their ideal of what the immortals should be as their
materialistic instincts permitted them to entertain.</p>

<p>The savages in the gully they had left behind still leaping about
the water's edge and shouting out their blind impotent rage, the
arrows which they sent off striking harmlessly against the plated
sides or falling short of their mark into the stream.</p>

<p>"Plofesley no bling back Nigley," observed John, gliding up to the
group and speaking softly over the heads of the girls.</p>

<p>"By Jove, you are right, John," said Hector with a start, as they
remembered, for the first time, the Greek.</p>

<p>"Where is Niggeree?"</p>

<p>The Professor opened his languid eyes at this moment, and gasped
out, "Water!"</p>

<p>They ran for a pannikin of water from the cabin, and, adding a few
drops of brandy, brought it and held it to his lips, which, after he
had drunk, seemed to revive him.</p>

<p>"Niggeree!" he murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes, where is he?"</p>

<p>"Dead."</p>

<p>A silence fell over the group, then the Professor continued in a
low whisper, with many a pause,--</p>

<p>"We went up the gully till we came to a vast cavern, into which we
penetrated. It was pitch dark, so that we had to carry lighted
sticks--a gloomy cavern of vast circumference, and seemingly without
a termination, filled, as we advanced, with noxious gases, which made
us feel as if intoxicated. Niggeree had the only box of vestas with
him, and went on in front. After going about half a mile we both fell
over a ridge where the ground seemed to recede under our feet, and
our lights were knocked from our hands and all was blackness.</p>

<p>"I shouted to Niggeree to give us another light, but he did not
answer me, and for a few moments I lay on the ground listening and
waiting for him to speak. Then, in front of me, I heard the muffled
rumbling and roaring of a mighty cataract, which seemed to have its
termination far underground.</p>

<p>"At last I could bear no more suspense, but crept forward, feeling
in front of me with my hands; then all in a moment I found myself
half hanging over the edge of a precipice, with nothing to grasp at
before me.</p>

<p>"It was so black that I could see nothing, only feel the cold damp
mist floating up from that vast abyss, with a deadly feeling as if
millions of tons of water were gliding silently before me--how far
off I could not say--millions of tons, sinking pronely down, down,
thousands of feet into that everlasting darkness.</p>

<p>"A mighty horror chained me to that spot, so that I could not draw
myself back, but lay feeling as if years had passed away since last I
saw the daylight, and that eventually I must be sucked into that
awful gulf, and no one ever know more of my doom than I did of
Niggeree's.</p>

<p>"My mind, also, even while thrilled with the horror, seemed to be
hard at work forming a hypothesis of the cause of this gulf and the
former depressions in the rock over which I had stumbled, so that
while I was lying in all this hell of icy fear I seemed, also, to be
travelling over the countless centuries which had already passed, and
to feel the water rolling over me as I lay at the bottom of the
dried-up basin into which I had first fallen--a period when the rocks
above projected over where I was lying, and the torrent rushed into
the cavern from the mountains above and formed an outlet down the
valley.</p>

<p>"Then the upper ledge becoming thinner by the constant wear, and
finally breaking off, or by an internal convulsion being split along
with the earth in front of me, shifting the position of the fall
while it swallowed it up, leaving the cavern and gully outside
dry.</p>

<p>"At last I seemed to wake up from my frozen stupor to a burning
desire to escape; or was it that I felt myself drawn back by strong
hairy claws, with which I fought, and at length threw from me? I
cannot say, for my mind seemed utterly unstrung as I madly sprang
back in the direction we had taken, and fled with a thousand horrors
behind and around me.</p>

<p>"There were some fissures which crossed our path in the coming,
but I did not think upon them as I rushed along, and somehow chance
aided me in my leaps, for I must have crossed them by accident.</p>

<p>"I panted as I ran, and it must have been my own hot breath
returning upon me from the near proximity of the rocks, which I at
times struck against, but it seemed to my excited imagination as if I
was pursued by demoniac figures, who blew their steaming breath
against me, while clutches were made at my shirt and hair from behind
as I ran.</p>

<p>"At length I saw daylight filtering grim and grey as it reflected
upon the sides of the rocks nearest, and much of my fear departed--my
foes also, if there were any, seemed to drift back into their
congenial darkness and leave me alone. Another turn, and the gully
spread before my eyes bathed in the ever-blessed sunshine of God,
through a framework of rocks and rope-like roots which dropped from
above.</p>

<p>"I was free, and a great flood of gratitude filled my burning
brain like rose-coloured flames, as, beside the headless body of a
great snake which Niggeree had shot at the entrance, now growing
putrid, I flung myself down and gabbled out loudly my incoherent
thanks."</p>

<p>The Professor's cheeks glowed with fever spots, and his dark eyes
blazed, as he recited his weird experiences, so that he seemed to
forget his weakness, as the words came with fewer pauses and louder
as he went on; but now he made a longer pause, and seemed unable to
go on.</p>

<p>"So that's the wind up of Nig the bold, is it?" observed Collins,
holding up the pannikin to the dying man's lips.</p>

<p>Killmann slowly nodded assent as he drank.</p>

<p>"It is good for you that you could remember some prayers up
there."</p>

<p>"Why so?" retorted the Professor.</p>

<p>"Because it always becomes a man to be thankful for benefits
received, and I hope ye didn't forget to put in a word or two while
at it for our poor mate, who had no time to do the job himself."</p>

<p>The Professor did not reply, but shut his eyes as if tired
out.</p>

<p>"Where did ye meet the savages?"</p>

<p>"Not far from the mouth of the gully. I had come out of the dry
watercourse and was wading through the stream, when my first
intimation was this arrow in my left shoulder--my shirt had been torn
from me in my passage through the cave. I turned about to see a vast
number sliding down the steep sides of the hill, and holding on to
limbs of trees, and ran on, shooting backwards as I went. It was just
before I met you that I received the second one into me; then I can
remember no more."</p>

<p>"Bad wounds they are, Professor," said Collins still wishing to
prepare the wounded man for his end.</p>

<p>"Not so bad--not fatal."</p>

<p>"I don't like to say much, Professor."</p>

<p>"But I feel easier now--bah, I have been wounded before as
seriously."</p>

<p>"Not when your blood was in such a heat; hardly so deep, and I
doubt if ever by the same kind of weapon."</p>

<p>"Ah, now I know; are they poisoned?"</p>

<p>Collins only looked down without replying.</p>

<p>"My God! am I to die like a poisoned rat, and with none of my work
in order--hardly begun?" shrieked out the wounded man, in an agonized
tone, while the women looked on with pitiful eyes.</p>

<p>"But, sir, there are some still left alive amongst my destroyers.
Where is my revolver?" and he pointed savagely at the group of
friendly natives with one hand, while he felt about his empty belt
with the other.</p>

<p>As he snarled out the words, they all turned about as if to leap
overboard in their fear, when Collins stopped them.</p>

<p>"Hold hard, friends, he can't hurt you, for he has no weapon; and
you, sir, if you want to die easy, keep still, as they have been good
friends to you."</p>

<p>"No dark skin can be a friend of white men."</p>

<p>"Can't they though, keep your mind easy, we have punished your
enemies pretty well, and these people are taking us home out of
kindness."</p>

<p>Killmann breathed hard as he lay back, but said nothing more on
the subject, and in a few moments afterwards permitted one of the
women to come over and sit beside him.</p>

<p>They had reached a portion of the river where it made a sharp
turn, and ran through a long valley with sloping banks and broad
green grass--fields.</p>

<p>Native pathways led through the fields and down to the waterside
over to a thick plantation, where at last they could see the welcome
tops of banana-trees.</p>

<p>"Let me go on shore and tell my people that the strangers are our
friends," said one of the natives, as the anchor was dropped over the
bows. So giving him some presents to take to his chief, they sent him
off, the women and children still staying with them.</p>

<p>In a short time they heard the loud sounds of drums, while from
the plantation came a band of men, women, and children, following the
chief, who strode on in front unarmed, and displaying lively symptoms
of joy; their friends had been singing the praises of their great
deeds of daring and the victory which they had won.</p>

<p>Hector and Collins met them on the banks, and made the usual signs
of friendship observed throughout the west; then the chief took their
hands and welcomed them as benefactors.</p>

<p>"Welcome, great white strangers, with your fire bamboos. Stay and
help us to kill all our enemies."</p>

<p>They all went through the gardens and villages, finding little
difference between the arrangement of houses there and those upon the
Fly River; only that they were mostly new, and some as yet
unfinished, as they had lately returned to this part of the country,
having been driven away the former season by the hill-tribe, and the
old place destroyed.</p>

<p>That night there was a great feast, celebrated with a native
dance, and many impromptu songs delivered in honour of the White Gods
who had come amongst them. The fires were lighted on the banks of the
river so that the Nora shone out brightly, on the deck of which they
sat with the chief and looked on at the performers, as they danced in
their feathered head-dresses and sang.</p>

<p>One of the young girls who had come aboard in the afternoon still
hovered about near to Hector, with whom she had made great friends; a
pretty young maiden of about sixteen, who showed her preference with
the open candour of a widow of forty-five.</p>

<p>In the shadow of the galley they both sat together and talked,
while Collins and the old chief smoked gravely on the open deck full
in the warm firelight.</p>

<p>Some of the wise women of the village had taken the Professor
under their charge, and were now busy upon him with their soothing
herbs, and muttering charms.</p>

<p>Before they went to sleep, they had arranged a grand walloby hunt
for the next day.</p>

<p>Professor Killmann had been deeper struck than even they at first
feared, and that night kept them all awake with his ravings.</p>

<p>His body was swelling rapidly before they came to anchor, and the
old chief no sooner saw him than he said calmly, "He will die before
the sun comes up," and went on to discuss the arrangements for the
morrow as if that matter was settled and need no longer be talked
about.</p>

<p>All through the night the fires were kept up on shore, while the
natives kept coming and going, sometimes with messages from the old
women who acted as death-bed attendants, or moving about the deck and
engine--house, touching things out of curiosity.</p>

<p>Collins sat smoking or dozing off close to the mattress on which
the dying man was laid, while Hector, tired out with his courting and
unaccustomed gallantry, had laid himself down on the cabin sofa where
he now lay sound asleep, while his dusky inammorata took her place
calmly on the floor beside him, to look after and watch the awakening
of her own special white god.</p>

<p>"Blast me, if that err wench won't make another Joe of my mate, if
he don't look out; none of them ever bother me."</p>

<p>Collins had come in to mix himself some grog, when he saw this
picture of connubial-like repose.</p>

<p>When he reached the deck the Professor was re-acting the scenes of
the day which had so fatal a termination.</p>

<p>"Hands off, you thief," he shouted. "It's all mine--gold--gold!
No, I will not give you a penny-weight. Ah! you will have it?--where
is he?--God, what a gulf."</p>

<p>"Strikes me, somehow, the Professor hasn't given us his yarn quite
complete," murmured Collins, stroking his jaws with his hand as he
meditatively stood looking down and puffing slowly.</p>

<p>"I guess he knows more about Nig's death than he is willing to
say. No odds, his score will be all wiped off the slate soon now. I
wish I could remember something suitable for the occasion, even a
grace might do for want of anything better."</p>

<p>But Collins could not recollect even a grace to do service over
this dying sinner.</p>

<p>A picture of pathetic gloom, this man of culture and scientific
enthusiasm dying like a dog, without being able to command a prayer
at this last dark hour. On the deck he lies, raving out suggestions
of past blood-guiltiness, with classical reminiscences of old college
days, or formerly built up arguments for his theories, ever and anon
coming back to that hour of gold lust and the after-time of
horror.</p>

<p>The crowd of natives squat or lounge about with perfect
indifference to his recollection or wealth of words, and only Collins
tries to pick out some thread of information regarding the fate of
Niggeree.</p>

<p>Hector woke up next morning as the daylight began to dawn, and
cast rather a sheepish eye upon his companion, who quietly rose as he
stirred and prepared to accompany him on deck.</p>

<p>"Pletty comfortably last night, skippel?" blandly inquires the
Chinese cook and steward, as he glides about, putting things to
right. "Bely pletty wifely you hab got now; me get mallied also
befole we leab."</p>

<p>"How is the Professor to-day?" inquired Hector, ignoring the
other's inuendo.</p>

<p>"He jist about finishly up his plofessleyship. Will you hab yurl
bathly firstly or your coffee?"</p>

<p>"I'll take coffee, and go up to see him; bring it to me?"</p>

<p>"All right, skippel; Misely Hector will help you, pelhaps, to
bathly aftelwalds."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hector, as John described her, seemed prepared to help the
young man in anything;--prepared for every extremity, in fact, except
that of losing sight of him; as he went up the little companionway
she glided after him like his shadow.</p>

<p>The dying man lay on his side, where he had been propped so that
the arrows might not touch against anything; his hollow eyes wandered
over the distant hills which terminated this fertile valley, through
which this broad river wound about like a silver-grey ribbon. The
light was pulsing up over the sky, and rapidly bringing life to this
sleeping landscape as it was ebbing away from Killmann. He knew now
that he was dying, and, like the brave explorer that he was, had
accepted the inevitable calmly, if not with resignation.</p>

<p>"Bury me here, for it is the fairest spot that I have yet seen in
this adopted land, and it is mine by right of discovery; you will
remember that if ever dispute arises--my discovery."</p>

<p>"Yes, Professor," said both the men.</p>

<p>"Call this river the Albert River, and write over my grave,
'Discoverer of the Albert River;' you promise to do this?"</p>

<p>"We do."</p>

<p>"Thank you;--my steamer and specimens take on to Thursday Island,
they are all addressed and catalogued as I went on, and my diary is
pretty complete; you have only to deliver them over to Government as
they are, and I leave you to tell the manner of my death----"</p>

<p>A long pause, as if the Professor was struggling with his
feelings, and trying to brace himself up to say more. They waited
patiently for his next words. At last they came, abruptly and
hurriedly,--</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my two friends, and forgive me if you can; I would have
killed you as I killed Niggeree yesterday, if I could have done it; I
threw him over the precipice, although I did not know it was there,
we quarrelled about--the----"</p>

<p>The Professor stopped, while his head suddenly fell forward on his
chest as the sun lifted its upper rim over the hills.</p>

<h3>Chapter XXXVII. A Walloby Hunt.</h3>

<p>BEYOND the ordinary feelings of gloom which follow death, there
was not much regret exhibited by any one on board at the death which
had just taken place. Killmann had not done a single action of
kindness to any one on board, and if his manner were at times soft
and his voice gentle, they were always suggestive of the tiger-cat
playing with his victim; the cook, indeed, did not attempt to conceal
his entire satisfaction at what he considered to be a most
providential dispensation, and went about his duty of preparing
breakfast with a more beaming countenance than he had shown since he
had been drafted on to the Nora.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with a feeling of relief that Hector hailed the
appearance of the walloby hunting-party which he was to accompany,
Collins having promised to stay on board and look after things.</p>

<p>The natives were by this time all over the ship; yet, although
they touched and handled everything, they were scrupulously honest,
and laid the things back, after gratifying their curiosity, as they
had found them.</p>

<p>Amongst the party who came on board, and who were of the hunters,
were the father and three brothers of "Jenny," as Hector called his
lady friend. She introduced him, and gave them special charge to
attend upon him during the day.</p>

<p>They made no inquiry as to where or how she had spent the night,
evidently thinking that she could look after herself, as Hector now
also began to think.</p>

<p>The other maidens who came on board chaffed her a good deal about
her conquest, but did not offer to cut her out in any way; she
received their fun with perfect calmness, and showed by her manner
that she was in complete possession.</p>

<p>Hector did not attempt to combat this female arrogation of his
free will. The tyrant was pretty and winning in her method of
subduing him, and he seemed pleased with the silken fetters which she
had cast about him from the first, yet it was not so much a case of
love-making on his part, as of allowing himself to be adored.</p>

<p>"I say, mate," growled Collins, "how far do you intend this
tom-fooling to go on?"</p>

<p>"Well, mate, I haven't quite made up my mind yet about it,"
replied Hector.</p>

<p>"She intends making it up for you, if you don't."</p>

<p>"Well, you see, mate, I might go further and fare worse; she's a
good--looking gal, and there'll be a tidy bit of land go along with
her."</p>

<p>"What! d'ye mean to settle down?"</p>

<p>"I might do worse," replied Hector, turning away.</p>

<p>"Ah! that's the way the wind blows; by the Lord, we might all do
worse, easily."</p>

<p>After the party left, Collins walked about the deck, puffing at
his cherry-wood pipe in a very much absorbed manner.</p>

<p>"Not a finer piece of ground in the whole country. A man might
easily clear his pile by a few years' squatting, and do nothing
himself all day long except lie on his back; Joe aint such a cussed
fool after all," he thought.</p>

<p>The girls made themselves merry with the Malay sailors and John,
who seemed to become a great favourite in a very short time. John's
cooking operations in consequence were much disturbed, and for the
first time a smell of burning pervaded the forenoon air, as his
galley became a general reception-room; but none of the fair ones
offered to approach the meditative Collins, perhaps considering him
too high a dignitary to approach without feelings of awe and
reverence.</p>

<p>On the after-deck, which none of the young women came near, sat a
circle of old crones, chanting a monotonous song in dreary tones as
they watched over the corpse, and kept the flies from alighting upon
the wax--like, sallow features.</p>

<p>The natives had to cross the river before they reached their
hunting--ground, and by way of preparation they came fasting to the
ground, and, when they started, walking in single file, trailed their
hunting-spears behind them without speaking a word.</p>

<p>Hector knew enough of native customs to accept his position in the
ranks, walking between the brothers of Jenny, and also carrying the
spear which they brought for him; yet, besides his spear, he had
taken the precaution of slinging his Winchester to his back.</p>

<p>In the rear followed the younger men, carrying coils of
native-spun nets and long poles.</p>

<p>He did not mention the breakfast which he had partaken of that
morning to his fellow-huntsmen.</p>

<p>By-and-by they came to the crossing, where they found a raft lying
ready made, composed of several pieces of log and crossed vines,
above which a large platform had been raised. Long rattans were
attached to the raft, and carried by expert swimmers across the
river, the swimmers then drawing the others over.</p>

<p>After crossing the river, they passed along in the same order and
silence until they reached a field of dry cane-grass, enclosed by
steep low hills on three sides, leaving a single outlet towards the
river-side.</p>

<p>They did not enter the field or valley, but now the younger men
ran round it, enclosing it with their nets, which they fastened to
the poles at different points, leaving here and there wide gaps
between, at which the hunters stationed themselves.</p>

<p>They had chosen the hour of day when what wind there was blew from
the hills down towards the river.</p>

<p>Then, after these arrangements were completed, they set fire to
the grass at the top of the valley, and waited patiently but watchful
at their gaps for the scared game to come out.</p>

<p>Hunting, like fishing, is a brutal and ignoble game, even at its
highest and most daring aspect, gloss it over however writers may
with showy descriptions and merry songs of, "We'll all go a-hunting
to-day," &amp;c. This was merely the converting of a peaceful valley
into a battue and slaughter-yard. As the flames and smoke rushed
downward all that had life fled towards the river, butting madly
against the restraining netting, until they had discovered the
treacherous gateways, and rushing, to reverse the simile, from the
fire into the frying-pan.</p>

<p>Kangaroos, wallobies, and wild pigs came charging down and out,
and as they passed were stabbed to death by the hunters.</p>

<p>It was all over in about half an hour, and then they could count
up their victims and carry them back to their rejoicing friends.
Hector did marvels with his spear, and when his arms tired of that
sport he brought out his Winchester and potted the retreating game
that had escaped the spear--thrusts. The wild pigs inspired no pity
in his breast. There is something about a pig, wild or tame, which
prompts one to kill it; a dead pig has no pathos about it: it is only
suggestive of roast pork, bacon, and grovelling baseness, without a
spark of sentiment to redeem it. But it was different with the
kangaroos and wallobies, as they leapt forward wildly and beat
against their trap nettings with the flames behind them, and their
hind--like eyes meltingly expressive of horror; Hector found it much
easier to hold back his spear and let them escape, than he did to
stab the gentle creatures to death.</p>

<p>With the other hunters supper was of much greater importance than
weak sentiment. Hector brought down a much greater number of wild
pigs than he bagged of kangaroos.</p>

<p>As they returned, heavily laden, they all sang a loud paean of
rejoicing over the quantity of flesh which they had secured.</p>

<p>Along the pathway, over the river, and towards the village they
passed, dancing and singing their loud song. Here the women met them
with glad cries, and took the game from them, staggering under the
welcome load, while the men slackened their pace, and prepared the
bamboo pipes.</p>

<p>Jenny came with the rest, and brought her mother along with her,
so that Hector had the rare delight of a maternal embrace to refresh
him. The old lady wanted to take him home, so that he might begin his
month of trial at once, but waved this fine point of etiquette when
she saw he would not come, and allowed him to go his own way, her
daughter following instead. Still the old lady wagged her head
disapprovingly as she let them go, as if it was establishing a
precedent dangerous to the rights and happiness of womankind. She,
however, looked narrowly after his share of the game, claiming all
which bore bullet-holes, and as many as they would allow her of the
others, carrying them, with the aid of the sons and husband, to her
own residence to cure at her leisure.</p>

<p>Hector was pleased to see the maiden again, and passing his arm
round her naked waist, went on with her leisurely through the fields
towards the river's edge. He had committed himself now, and did not
regret his betrothal, for she was very tender and soft when she was
alone with him, if dignified a trifle before spectators.</p>

<p>They did not speak much, for they could not, as they went through
the fields, but they paused often and faced one another; then the
space lessened between them considerably, and Hector did not care how
soon the wedding came off, as he felt her warm body against his upper
pijamas, and her moist, loving lips pressed against his.</p>

<p>They did not require to speak much, for Jenny felt herself the
mistress of the position; she had caught her hare, and she knew how
to dress him, as what woman doesn't, savage or civilized.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>When they came to the banks of the river she was like Venus
carrying the arms of Mars, for round her slender shoulders she had
the dreaded Winchester, and stuck in the waist of her raumma or grass
petticoat his trusty revolvers, while he walked along at her side,
with his arm loosely circling her neck.</p>

<p>He had made up his mind to be a Papuan farmer.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" said he, starting back, as his eyes rested on the river,
and rubbing them with both hands to see if he was really awake; "the
Thunder alongside of the Nora!"</p>

<p>It was so. There lay the Thunder alongside of the Nora, with the
light smoke escaping from her funnel.</p>

<p>"Who would have thought it?" And he ran along the river-bank and
up the plank towards the steamer, Jenny, faithful, never-failing
Jenny, following at his heels.</p>

<p>There a greater surprise awaited him--the supposed to be dead
Niggeree calmly smoking his pipe, in the company of Bowman, Brown,
Danby, Collins, Captain MacAndrews, and Hans the engineer.</p>

<p>"Had good sport?" observed Niggeree, looking up with an
unconcerned air.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blessed!" was all Hector could ejaculate, as he dropped
of a heap into the vacant deck-chair. "Could any one hand me a
drink?"</p>

<h3>Chapter XXXVIII. Hibiscus Blossoms.</h3>

<p>"WALL, you see," said the Greek, settling himself down for a tall
yarn, "this is how it all happened, as nearly as I can spin it," and
then he paused for some time to collect his thoughts.</p>

<p>They had consigned the Professor to his last home before supper,
the natives digging the grave for him on the river-bank; the
grave-stone was a slab of wood, at present painted white by Collins,
and on which he intended to write the dead man's last wishes after
the present coat of paint had dried. It was lying up against the
boiler.</p>

<p>Supper was over, and they were all on deck, with their glasses
placed handy, and a lantern swung aloft to let them see the way to
their mouths; the Singalese steward was in attendance, as John had
gone ashore to stay with some of his newly-gained and admiring
friends. Hector had his own special attendant, who took care never to
let his glass remain long empty, so that already he began to feel as
if the comforts of married life were dawning upon him.</p>

<p>Jenny filled his pipe--she had learned the English way of doing
it--and kept his glass well replenished, in spite of the coarse jests
of the others. Jenny acted as young ladies will do in the days of
courting and very early honeymoon, while Hector leaned back,
contented and satisfied with himself (as the male animal always is
under such circumstances), thinking that this was the sort of life
that ought to last for ever. It is so gratifying to be an autocrat,
and have at least one faithful slave at your elbow.</p>

<p>"I don't want to abuse any one who is dead and gone," said Nig,
"so I'll jist say that the party as has just been stowed alow ground
and myself had a bit o' a racket, about what is of no consequence to
any one not concarned. We froze on to one another, and raised
creation, all in the dark; for, as you will obsarve, our mill took
place in a cave arter our torches were kicked out."</p>

<p>"Wherever were you, Nig?" inquired Danby.</p>

<p>"Wall, you see, as they will tell you, the party as is gone and I
went out on an exploring expedition, and, after going up a gully, we
came to a cave, where all was black as Captain Kid's flag, barring
the skull and cross-bones.</p>

<p>"A mighty snake warned us not to go in, but the party as was with
me would do it, so I blowed the head of that ere reptile and pushed
on.</p>

<p>"By-and-by we both fell on our noses, knocking the light out, and
that I reckon raised our bile, for afore long we had holt o' one
another, wrestling and kicking up the clay all round. I guess I was
as much to blame as he, an' he was as much to blame as me, and that's
the best I can say about it.</p>

<p>"Wall, as you can see, we were fighting away, not knowing whur we
were putting our feet, whan all at once I felt the ground give way
under me, an' I was falling, the Lord only knows whar.</p>

<p>"I made a wild clutch forward, and at that moment got catch of a
bit of ledge, to which I clung on like grim death, with my feet
dangling down, and the devil's own darkness all about me.</p>

<p>"I reckon that I am a pretty fair holder-on if I once get a grip,
but I held on to that rock as I never thought any man could.</p>

<p>"It might ha' been moments, and it might ha' been hours, that I
hung on to that rock, as you might do to a trapeze, with nothing
below me to touch with my feet, an' a most awful sound below, like as
if it was two miles of a drop into boiling water, and all my weight
upon my two arms like to tear them out of their sockets.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you what it was like,--like something I once read of
in the 'Spanish Inquisition;' I darn't let go with that sound below
me, an' I felt I must give way some time.</p>

<p>"An' all the time my hands and arms ached; it felt as if raining
upwards, a drizzly ice-cold rain that froze and cramped me all
over.</p>

<p>"At last I began to see things dancing afore my eyes, bloody spots
and rings of yellow with blue insides, that grew from little to big,
and down again to wriggling worms, and the cramp got into my aching
fingers, and I felt that I must let go.</p>

<p>"Wall, you see, it's nothing-like to tell about it; but, Lord
above, it wor something to feel.</p>

<p>"When would I stop dropping when I fell, and into what would I
drop; would I hit anything on the road and hurt much, afore the last
landing--place? My fingers were slipping, spite of me digging my
nails in till they were torn off, as you ken see; then I gave
way."</p>

<p>"You did not fall into that infernal gulf, surely," cried Hector,
excited over the remembrance of the Professor's account of the
place.</p>

<p>"Wall, no, I didn't quite fall, for it had been a ghastly sell all
the time. I warn't three inches from my landing-place, yet I thought
my heart had burst as I came down on my back, for as I touched the
solid everything went from me, so that I knew no more for that
time.</p>

<p>"I guess I must ha' fainted, for when I came to I found myself
lying on the side of the mountain not far from the edge of a great
deep hole, into which a big waterfall plunged from a high cliff over
my head.</p>

<p>"I could see the water rushing over the rocks black and swift,
like a mill-race, without a sound of water, so that it gave me the
creeps to see it fall so deathly quiet."</p>

<p>"None of your lies, Nig; tell us how you got up?"</p>

<p>"That, mates, I can tell you no more about than the man o' the
moon. There I was, and that's all I can say about it--it might ha'
been an angel that flew up with me, or else--"</p>

<p>"The devil, more like!"</p>

<p>"I won't be positive either way, for as I got up I saw two or
three black--looking critters, not unlike the devil, skurrying up the
trees, with long tails behind them."</p>

<p>"Had you been drinking much, before you went out on that spree?"
inquired Danby, gravely.</p>

<p>"Not enough for what you mean, Mr. Danby," said Nig, lighting his
pipe, and sucking energetically for two or three seconds.</p>

<p>"Well, go on," said Bowman. "How did you get down?"</p>

<p>"Wot's the good of telling a yarn if it's not believed?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I believe it," said Bowman.</p>

<p>"Like Gospel," added Danby.</p>

<p>"Come, finish it off," they all cried.</p>

<p>"The getting down warn't at all difficult. It got on dark not long
after I started, so I lay down in the bush and had a sleep till
daylight this morning, and then I got down to the gully we started
from, to find the Nora gone."</p>

<p>"Did you see any natives?" asked Collins.</p>

<p>"Plenty lying about without their heads, but not one alive; so I
thought, maybe, ye had had a bit of a scrimmage, and might come back
to look after me, and I sat down to wait."</p>

<p>"Yes, we--yes, we saw him sitting without a stitch on the shore as
we passed, and picked him up in the passing," observed Bowman, "and
brought him on."</p>

<p>"That's all my yarn, mates," said the Greek. "I went into that
cave with my togs on, my Winchester, colts, and cutlass around me,
and summut in my pockets, and found myself on the hill-top same as if
I had been born again, an' I don't ask you to believe it; I guess I
wouldn't either, if any one else told it to me."</p>

<p>Niggeree took up his glass and drained it, and then returned to
his pipe.</p>

<p>"What do you think the animals were that you saw?" asked Hector,
from his seat.</p>

<p>"Monkeys--or baboons, I dunno which."</p>

<p>"Monkeys in New Guinea?" exclaimed Hector.</p>

<p>"I can't think of anything else," replied Nig, "and I don't want
to bother my brains any more about it. I was down that hole, and now
I am sitting here, and that is all I know about it. It is uncommon
strange!"</p>

<p>This they all admitted, and then turned to hear the other
adventures.</p>

<p>"What do you think of the scenery about this part of the country,
captain?" asked Collins, of MacAndrews, as they hob-nobbed
together.</p>

<p>"Grand, sublime, just like a drop-scene which I saw in Sydney,
when they were acting Micky Dhue."</p>

<p>The worthy old skipper meant the "Mikado."</p>

<p>"Yes, the Albert River beats the Fly all to fits," returned
Collins, in the gratified tone which a man uses when he hears
something belonging to him praised.</p>

<p>"Collins, old man," said Brown, at this point, "you may call it
the Albert River, if you like, out of respect for the departed, when
amongst your and his friends, and write the name on that slab also,
as it was a dying promise; but it must be written differently on the
charts, as it had been christened before ever you saw it--say, how
many days is it since you sighted it?"</p>

<p>"This makes the sixth day--two days going down the Fly, four days
back and forward from the 'Collins'--that makes six, and the other
six we've been on this water, from sea-entrance to here," replied
Collins.</p>

<p>"Ah! that just gives the Thunder two days' clear start of the
Nora, which I will demonstrate to you beyond a doubt," said Brown.
"Eight days ago we penetrated the Aird River, to find out as you did,
but before you did by two days, that it was only one of many mouths
of the present river, which we christened 'The Douglas,' and the
Douglas it has to be from this time henceforth."</p>

<p>"Have you also christened the Collins River?" inquired Hector,
quietly getting up from his chair, and coming forward towards
Brown.</p>

<p>"No, Captain Hector; I yield to you and your friend the right to
that discovery," responded Brown, frankly.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Brown, I only asked for information," and Hector
went back once more to his shadow.</p>

<p>"If I had been there I would have proved it to your satisfaction,
as I hope to do this. Steward, fetch my charts and diary," said
Brown.</p>

<p>The Singalese glided off and returned with the articles required,
placing them at the feet of the explorer, and while stooping
whispered something in his ear.</p>

<p>"Oh! hang your slips of paper," said the explorer, "mark all the
drinks down to me to-night."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sah," and the steward slid back once more to his place
behind the circle.</p>

<p>"There you are, boys, and something more than you know already,
which you can look at as I read my notes," said he, spreading open
his rough chart and showing it to them. Collins and Hector both came
forward and knelt down over it, while Mr. Brown read; Niggeree, as if
taking no interest in the matter, sat where he was.</p>

<p>"This is the 29th, isn't it?" asked Brown.</p>

<p>"Yes," responded the others.</p>

<p>"All right, now listen: 1 21st.--Arrived at the mouth of the Aird
River, where we found a broad channel carrying three to sveen fathoms
of water right into the river. After following up the Aird, we found
that it was only one of many mouths of a great freshwater river
coming from mountain ranges. After trying several channels we got
into the main river, which we followed up for several miles in a
direct line from coast, carrying good water all the way into mountain
ranges."</p>

<p>"Right you are," say the others.</p>

<p>"We determined to call it the Douglas River, and returning down,
as we had to go to Motu-motu, struck a fresh branch and came out in
Deception Bay."</p>

<p>"Ah! you did, did you?" said Collins.</p>

<p>"We did. After finishing our business at Motu-motu, we returned,
searching the coast, and discovered a magnificent new river with an
entrance over three miles wide, close to Bald Head. We proceeded up
this river 110 miles, passing through ranges and gorges, in places
1500 feet high, its principal trend being easterly and north
easterly, and unusually serpentine. This river we called the Jubilee,
while the ranges we have called what you want the river to be, viz.
the Albert Ranges. There, are you satisfied, boys?"</p>

<p>Mr. Brown closed his diary, and clasped it as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Quite satisfied, Mr. Brown, and I ask your pardon," said Hector,
going up with his hand outstretched.</p>

<p>"Don't mention it, old man," said Brown, cordially taking the
other's hand. "I wish, for your sake, I could have obliged you by
being last on the ground"--and he laughed heartily--"but can't afford
it, you know--have to report dates, &amp;c., to headquarters."</p>

<p>"It isn't for our sakes I wanted it," said Hector, "but for the
poor professor, who has found a grave where he thought he had
discovered a new river. He was late for the Fly, and now he is too
late for this."</p>

<p>"It is hard lines," said Brown, "to be too late for everything,
and to discover only what some one else justly claims; but it is a
common destiny of mankind. At the most we can only travel along in
this too-late century. The world, after New Guinea is laid open, will
be used up, and ought, by the natural order of things, to burst.
Still, boys, there's a lot to find out about here yet, and a deal to
be made out of it, also; so let us drink, 'Success to the Land of the
Hibiscus Blossom.'"</p>

<p>The glasses were drained to this toast, after which the explorer
continued,--</p>

<p>"I can see it all coming about in the future--in my mind's eye,
Horatio, of course--these splendid-looking savages, with their quick
adaptability, blending in with us, the men of civilization, and
rising in the ranks; towns rear where the villages now stand, and the
acclimatized Queenslanders flocking over and growing rich when
drivelling old England has lost her best blood, as she has already
lost the best portion of this mighty island, through her own blind
old-world stupidity."</p>

<p>"And the Germans will set us the example in their end," quoth
Niggeree quietly. "No blank missionary there to spoil fair
trade."</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean black traffic by fair trade, Nig," put in
Danby.</p>

<p>"I mean what I mean," responded Nig. "The Germans will set us the
example, as they always do when new ground has to be broken, when
perseverance, patience, and hard labour are wanted. I don't blame
them for taking what they had offered to them, though I, as a good
colonist, grudge them their luck; but I do blame the man with the
ass's ears and foxy tongue who, in the triumph of his blundering
ignorance, gave away the birthright of Australia from his country's
own daughter, because she was abroad, and not under his very nose to
assert her rights."</p>

<p>"As for the missionaries," continued the explorer, "they are doing
what they can, as they always do, to raise the races, and if they do
try to keep the world as it was, or supposed to be, in the early days
of Mother Eve, small blame to them, even although their work should
be all in vain. As it has always been so will it be, the natural man
must disappear, with his simple tastes and little wants, before the
artificial man with his requirements. They may merge, but they must
eventually disappear; it is all according to the law of
evolution."</p>

<p>At this moment the Ching cook came back with a bevy of fair
maidens following, and the outside of his solitary lock adorned with
a wreath of hibiscus leaves and flowers, while clusters of the same
ornamental shrub, intermixed with croton leaves, had been twisted
about his slender form. He approached decked out like a Chinese god
during high festival, surrounded by his devotees. Three of the
damsels seemed to have taken him under their special charge, and now
gathered forward, fondling his pig-tail tenderly, as if it was a
charm against witchcraft.</p>

<p>"There is John, you see, setting the example in the merging
question, if he can decide amongst so many."</p>

<p>"I hab decidedly, Messly Blown, to do my duty and not be gleedy. I
am going to tuln a falmer, and only hab tlee."</p>

<p>"Three of them, John? Why, you are easily pleased. When is the
marriage to take place?"</p>

<p>"In a monthly, if Skippel Negley will let me stay behindly."</p>

<p>"You can stay, John, till I return with the Sunflower, and I
reckon by that time that you will have enough of matrimony on the
large scale," graciously answered the Greek, whose frequent
applications to the pannikin had made him more than ordinarily
agreeable.</p>

<p>John thanked his master profusely, apparently thunderstruck with
his unaccustomed generosity, and retired to the fore part of the
vessel with his train, where the Malays were, and where shortly arose
loud sounds of merriment.</p>

<p>"Do you intend coming back soon?" inquired Hector from his corner
to Niggeree.</p>

<p>"Yes, I mean to explore that mountain again, and find out what
lifted me up; also see if I cannot get back my Winchester again, as I
prize it. You intend stopping, also, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes--I think so," returned Hector, in a hesitating tone.</p>

<p>"And I think you are wise, old boy," returned Brown. "If I hadn't
left a Mrs. B., I might follow your example. I reckon the pair of you
ought to make a fine breed for the future country, and there's a good
few pots of money lying idle in these fat fields."</p>

<p>"I reckon there aint much gold about these fields," retorted
Niggeree with undue haste.</p>

<p>"Not in the sense you mean, perhaps, although even about that I
have my own thoughts; it is in a broader and much more profitable way
that I refer to the man who can claim some of this land as a freehold
to hand down to his offspring. I hope some day to be able to settle
down here myself."</p>

<p>"Look out for a squaw for me against I get back, mate," cried out
the Greek.</p>

<p>"Why, you old polygamous pirate, how many women do you want to
claim before you are strung up?" asked Danby.</p>

<p>"You shut up, youngster."</p>

<p>"You can see that you are not born to be drowned, at any rate now,
surely, after escaping that waterfall; so I don't see how else you
can pass away except you are translated, you know," remarked Brown,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Take my advice, and stick to the East End beauties which you have
already won, Nig, down amongst the cannibals of Killerton, and leave
these Western beauties alone. You would never make a good
farmer."</p>

<p>"Talking about Killerton Island, they say that you had to hook it
from there for eating two of your wives. Is that true?"</p>

<p>"No, it aint true, and I can go back to Killerton to-morrow if I
liked," answered the badgered Greek in a surly tone.</p>

<p>"Then you must take me over there some time when you go," said
Brown, quickly.</p>

<p>"When you like, mate; and I promise to bring you back safe, also,
if you do come."</p>

<p>"All right; we'll arrange about it by-and-by. Good-night, boys; I
must turn in, for we mean to be off again to-morrow. Time's about up,
and we are due at Thursday Island next Saturday."</p>

<p>1 I quote here from Mr. Brown's diary, by permission.</p>

<h3>Chapter XXXIX. Bon Soir, Queen Ine.</h3>

<p>NEXT morning the Thunder and Nora turned their prows towards the
sea, a regular flotilla of fishing and state canoes accompanying them
for some miles upon their way.</p>

<p>The young braves came decked up in their gala-day ornaments, and
the plantations seemed to be stripped of their glory for the
occasion, as not only were the heads adorned, but the carved beaks
and gunnels were glowing with scarlet and green until they looked
like floating gardens.</p>

<p>Hector and the polygamous-inclined John were to go into regular
matrimonial training-harness when the canoes returned, their month of
probation to reckon from the hour they began their courtship, as the
results were considered settled already and the dowry regarded as
satisfactory.</p>

<p>John had invested his past wages as cook in bags of rice, packages
of salt, and much trading tobacco, which the Malays had helped him to
divide and convey to the different mansions of his brides. It was
arranged that he would divide his hours equally amongst the three,
while meantime they assisted him to put up his future house and
palisade his different estates; for as each bride brought her own
portion of land, the astute Celestial was twice wealthier than the
unambitious Hector, and as he was, like all his race, by instinct a
born gardener, if he could only keep his team in order, he boded fair
to be the wealthiest man of the district with this superior start in
life.</p>

<p>So far his blandness and impartial partiality seemed to keep the
yellow fiend from the ground; they were all merry over their prize,
and regarded the pigtail with as great affection and respect as he
felt for it himself.</p>

<p>So the warm sun gilds all nature, and there is no sign of rain
about.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>Niggeree went with Collins in the Nora to Port Moresby, to look
after their different vessels, with a promise that they would join
the Thunder soon at Thursday Island and start on fresh
adventures.</p>

<p>Over the laughing ocean went the Thunder towards home, past the
sleeping sea-snakes and flying-fish, while the dolphins gambolled in
front, and all creation seemed to play.</p>

<p>A merry passage, in which young Danby did not torment Captain
MacAndrews more than he could help.</p>

<p>A brief halt at Darnley and Murray Islands to take orders, and a
parting glass with bluff old Joe and his tawny queen, who has
forgotten her grief and grins grimly upon them as they sail away.</p>

<p>"Ta-ta, Prince Consort. Bon soir, Queen Ine. It is not good-bye,
but only au revoir."</p>
