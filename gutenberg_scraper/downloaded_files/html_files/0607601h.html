  <p>Down here where the ships loom large in<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gloom when the sea-storms veer,<br>
    Down here on the south-west margin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the western hemisphere,<br>
    Where the might of a world-wide ocean<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the youngest land rolls free&mdash;<br>
    Storm-bound from the world&rsquo;s commotion,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie the Ports of the Open Sea.</p>
  <p>By the bluff where the grey sand reaches<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the kerb of the spray-swept street,<br>
    By the sweep of the black sand beaches<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the main-road travellers&rsquo; feet,<br>
    By the heights like a work Titanic,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begun ere the gods&rsquo; work ceased,<br>
    By a bluff-lined coast volcanic<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie the Ports of the wild South-east.</p>
  <p>By the steeps of the snow-capped ranges,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the scarped and terraced hills&mdash;<br>
    Far away from the swift life-changes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the wear of the strife that kills&mdash;<br>
    Where the land in the Spring seems younger<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than a land of the Earth might be&mdash;<br>
    Oh! the hearts of the rovers hunger<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Ports of the Open Sea.</p>
  <p>But the captains watch and hearken<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a sign of the South Sea wrath&mdash;<br>
    Let the face of the South-east darken,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they turn to the ocean path.<br>
    Ay, the sea-boats dare not linger,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the cargo be;<br>
    When the South-east lifts a finger<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the Ports of the Open Sea.</p>
  <p>South by the bleak Bluff faring,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North where the Three Kings wait,<br>
    South-east the tempest daring&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flight through the storm-tossed strait;<br>
    Yonder a white-winged roamer<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struck where the rollers roar&mdash;<br>
    Where the great green froth-flaked comber<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaks down on a black-ribbed shore.</p>
  <p>For the South-east lands are dread lands<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the sailor in the shrouds,<br>
    Where the low clouds loom like headlands,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the black bluffs blur like clouds.<br>
    When the breakers rage to windward<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lights are masked a-lee,<br>
    And the sunken rocks run inward<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a Port of the Open Sea.</p>
  <p>But oh! for the South-east weather&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweep of the three-days&rsquo; gale&mdash;<br>
    When, far through the flax and heather,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spindrift drives like hail.<br>
    Glory to man&rsquo;s creations<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That drive where the gale grows gruff,<br>
    When the homes of the sea-coast stations<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flash white from the dark&rsquo;ning bluff!</p>
  <p>When the swell of the South-east rouses<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrath of the Maori sprite,<br>
    And the brown folk flee their houses<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crouch in the flax by night,<br>
    And wait as they long have waited&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fear as the brown folk be&mdash;<br>
    The wave of destruction fated<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Ports of the Open Sea.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <p>Grey cloud to the mountain bases,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild boughs that rush and sweep;<br>
    On the rounded hills the tussocks<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like flocks of flying sheep;<br>
    A lonely storm-bird soaring<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er tussock, fern and tree;<br>
    And the boulder beaches roaring<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hymn of the Open Sea.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheThreeKings"></a>The Three Kings</b></h2>
  <p align="center"><font size="+1">[Three sea-girt pinnacles off North Cape, New Zealand.]</font></p>
  <p>The East is dead and the West is done, and again our course lies thus:&mdash;<br>
    South-east by Fate and the Rising Sun where the Three Kings wait for us.<br>
    <i>When our hearts are young and the world is wide, and the heights seem grand
  to climb&mdash;</i><br>
  <i>We are off and away to the Sydney-side; but the Three Kings bide their time.</i></p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been to the West,&rsquo; the digger said: he was bearded,
    bronzed and old;<br>
&lsquo;Ah, the smothering curse of the East is wool, and the curse of the West
  is gold.<br>
&lsquo;I went to the West in the golden boom, with Hope and a life-long mate,<br>
&lsquo;They sleep in the sand by the Boulder Soak, and long may the Three Kings
  wait.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had my fling on the Sydney-side,&rsquo; said a black-sheep
    to the sea,<br>
  &lsquo;Let the young fool learn when he can&rsquo;t be taught: I&rsquo;ve learnt
  what&rsquo;s good for me.&rsquo;<br>
    And he gazed ahead on the sea-line dim&mdash;grown dim in his softened eyes&mdash;<br>
    With a pain in his heart that was good for him&mdash;as he saw the Three
    Kings rise.</p>
  <p>A pale girl sits on the foc&rsquo;sle head&mdash;she is back, Three Kings!
    so soon;<br>
    But it seems to her like a life-time dead since she fled with him &lsquo;saloon.&rsquo;<br>
    There is refuge still in the old folks&rsquo; arms for the child that loved
    too well;<br>
    They will hide her shame on the Southern farm&mdash;and the Three Kings will
    not tell.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas a restless heart on the tide of life, and a false star in the
    skies<br>
    That led me on to the deadly strife where the Southern London lies;<br>
    But I dream in peace of a home for me, by a glorious southern sound,<br>
    As the sunset fades from a moonlit sea, and the Three Kings show us round.</p>

    No straighter mate to his mates than he<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had ever said: &lsquo;Len&rsquo;s a match!&rsquo;<br>
  &rsquo;Twill be long, old man, ere our glasses clink,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twill be long ere we grip your hand!&mdash;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the dark tide came between.</p>

    A stealer and duffer of cattle was he,<br>

    Or a diamond rather&mdash;the heart of a girl;<br>
    She served with a squatter who lived on the plain,<br>
    And the name of the girl it was Mary Lemaine.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas a drear, rainy day and the twilight was done,<br>
    When four mounted troopers rode up to the run.<br>
    They spoke to the squatter&mdash;he asked them all in.<br>
    The homestead was small and the walls they were thin;<br>
    And in the next room, with a cold in her head,<br>
    Our Mary was sewing on buttons&mdash;in bed.</p>
  <p>She heard a few words, but those words were enough&mdash;<br>
    The troopers were all on the track of Jim Duff.<br>

    To capture the scamp in Maginnis&rsquo;s Gap.<br>

    But Mary was off, on the squatter&rsquo;s best horse;<br>
    With your hand on your heart, just to deaden the pain,<br>
    Ride hard to the ranges, brave Mary Lemaine!</p>
  <p>She rode by the ridges all sullen and strange,<br>
    And far up long gullies that ran through the range,<br>
    Till the rain cleared away, and the tears in her eyes<br>
    Caught the beams of the moon from Maginnis&rsquo;s Rise.<br>
    A fire in the depths of the gums she espied,<br>
  &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; shouted Jim. &lsquo;It is Mary!&rsquo;she
  cried.</p>
  <p>Next morning the sun rose in splendour again,<br>
    And two loving sinners rode out on the plain.<br>
    And baffled, and angry, and hungry and damp,<br>
    The four mounted troopers rode back to the camp.<br>
    But they hushed up the business&mdash;the reason is plain,<br>
    They all had been &lsquo;soft&rsquo; on fair Mary Lemaine.</p>

    For a moment shyly smiling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She would grant me one kiss more&mdash;<br>
    Slip away and leave me happy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the shake-down on the floor.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till I rest for evermore<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no traces now.<br>
    And many rains have levelled<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furrows of the plough;<br>
    And my bright days are olden,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the twisted branches wave<br>
    And the wattle blossoms golden<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the hill by Mary&rsquo;s grave.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="OldStoneChimney"></a>Old Stone Chimney</b></h2>
  <p>The rising&nbsp;moon on the peaks was blending<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her silver light with the sunset glow,<br>
    When a swagman came as the day was ending<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along a path that he seemed to know.<br>
    But all the fences were gone or going&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand of ruin was everywhere;<br>
    The creek unchecked in its course was flowing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For none of the old clay dam was there.</p>
  <p>Here Time had been with his swiftest changes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And husbandry had westward flown;<br>
    The cattle tracks in the rugged ranges<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were long ago with the scrub o&rsquo;ergrown.<br>
    It must have needed long years to soften<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road, that as hard as rock had been;<br>
    The mountain path he had trod so often<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay hidden now with a carpet green.</p>
  <p>He thought at times from the mountain courses<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the sound of a bullock bell,<br>
    The distant gallop of stockmen&rsquo;s horses,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stockwhip&rsquo;s crack that he knew so well:<br>
    But these were sounds of his memory only,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they were gone from the flat and hill,<br>
    For when he listened the place was lonely,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The range was dumb and the bush was still.</p>
  <p>The swagman paused by the gap and faltered,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For down the gully he feared to go,<br>
    The scene in memory never altered&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene before him had altered so.<br>
    But hope is strong, and his heart grew bolder,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over his sorrows he raised his head,<br>
    He turned his swag to the other shoulder,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plodded on with a firmer tread.</p>
  <p>Ah, hope is always the keenest hearer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fancies much when assailed by fear;<br>
    The swagman thought, as the farm drew nearer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the sounds that he used to hear.<br>
    His weary heart for a moment bounded,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment brief he forgot his dread;<br>
    For plainly still in his memory sounded<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The welcome bark of a dog long dead.</p>
  <p>A few steps more and his face grew ghostly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then white as death in the twilight grey;<br>
    Deserted wholly, and ruined mostly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Old Selection before him lay.<br>
    Like startled spectres that paused and listened,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The few white posts of the stockyard stood;<br>
    And seemed to move as the moonlight glistened<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And paled again on the whitened wood.</p>
  <p>And thus he came, from a life long banished<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To other lands, and of peace bereft,<br>
    To find the farm and the homestead vanished,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only the old stone chimney left.<br>
    The field his father had cleared and gardened<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was overgrown with saplings now;<br>
    The rain had set and the drought had hardened<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furrows made by a vanished plough.</p>
  <p>And this, and this was the longed-for haven<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he might rest from a life of woe;<br>
    He read a name on the mantel graven&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name was his ere he stained it so.<br>
  &lsquo;And so remorse on my care encroaches&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I have not suffered enough,&rsquo; he said;<br>
  &lsquo;That name is pregnant with deep reproaches&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The past won&rsquo;t bury dishonoured dead!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Ah, now he knew it was long years after,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And felt how swiftly a long year speeds;<br>
    The hardwood post and the beam and rafter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had rotted long in the tangled weeds.<br>
    He found that time had for years been sowing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coarse wild scrub on the homestead path,<br>
    And saw young trees by the chimney growing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mountain ferns on the wide stone hearth.</p>
  <p>He wildly thought of the evil courses<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brought disgrace on his father&rsquo;s name;<br>
    The escort robbed, and the stolen horses,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The felon&rsquo;s dock with its lasting shame.<br>
  &lsquo;Ah, God! Ah, God! is there then no pardon?&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cried in a voice that was strained and hoarse;<br>
    He fell on the weeds that were once a garden,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sobbed aloud in his great remorse.</p>
  <p>But grief must end, and his heart ceased aching<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When pitying sleep to his eye-lids crept,<br>
    And home and friends who were lost in waking,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all came back while the stockman slept.<br>
    And when he woke on the empty morrow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain at his heart was a deadened pain;<br>
    And bravely bearing his load of sorrow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wandered back to the world again.</p>

  <p>Far back&nbsp;in the days when the blacks used to ramble<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In long single file &rsquo;neath the evergreen tree,<br>
    The wool-teams in season came down from Coonamble,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And journeyed for weeks on their way to the sea,<br>
  &rsquo;Twas then that our hearts and our sinews were stronger,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those were the days when the bushman was bred.<br>
    We journeyed on roads that were rougher and longer<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than roads where the feet of our grandchildren tread.</p>
  <p>With mates who have gone to the great Never-Never,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mates whom I&rsquo;ve not seen for many a day,<br>
    I camped on the banks of the Cudgegong River<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yarned at the fire by the old bullock-dray.<br>
    I would summon them back from the far Riverina,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From days that shall be from all others distinct,<br>
    And sing to the sound of an old concertina<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their rugged old songs where strange fancies were linked.</p>
  <p>We never were lonely, for, camping together,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We yarned and we smoked the long evenings away,<br>
    And little I cared for the signs of the weather<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When snug in my hammock slung under the dray.<br>
    We rose with the dawn, were it ever so chilly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When yokes and tarpaulins were covered with frost,<br>
    And toasted the bacon and boiled the black billy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where high on the camp-fire the branches were tossed.</p>
  <p>On flats where the air was suggestive of &rsquo;possums,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And homesteads and fences were hinting of change,<br>
    We saw the faint glimmer of appletree blossoms<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And far in the distance the blue of the range;<br>
    And here in the rain, there was small use in flogging<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor, tortured bullocks that tugged at the load,<br>
    When down to the axles the waggons were bogging<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And traffic was making a marsh of the road.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas hard on the beasts on the terrible pinches,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where two teams of bullocks were yoked to a load,<br>
    And tugging and slipping, and moving by inches,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-way to the summit they clung to the road.<br>
    And then, when the last of the pinches was bested,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(You&rsquo;ll surely not say that a glass was a sin?)<br>
    The bullocks lay down &rsquo;neath the gum trees and rested &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullockies steered for the bar of the inn.</p>
  <p>Then slowly we crawled by the trees that kept tally<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of miles that were passed on the long journey down.<br>
    We saw the wild beauty of Capertee Valley,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As slowly we rounded the base of the Crown.<br>
    But, ah! the poor bullocks were cruelly goaded<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While climbing the hills from the flats and the vales;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas here that the teams were so often unloaded<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That all knew the meaning of &lsquo;counting your bales.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And, oh! but the best-paying load that I carried<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was one to the run where my sweetheart was nurse.<br>
    We courted awhile, and agreed to get married,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And couple our futures for better or worse.<br>
    And as my old feet grew too weary to drag on<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The miles of rough metal they met by the way,<br>
    My eldest grew up and I gave him the waggon &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s plodding along by the bullocks to-day.</p>

    The growl of sleepy voices&mdash;a candle in the bar.<br>
    A stumble in the passage of folk with wits abroad;<br>

    A flash on shrouded waggons, on water ghastly white;<br>
    Weird bush and scattered remnants of rushes in the night<br>
    Across the swollen river a flash beyond the ford:<br>

    In their loneliness they were parted thus<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the work to do,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By hearts and hands so few.</p>
  <p>The darkest land &rsquo;neath a blue sky&rsquo;s dome,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While one reeled on alone&mdash;<br>
    The dust of Australia&rsquo;s greatest dead<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dust of the desert blown!<br>
    Gaunt cheek-bones cracking the parchment skin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That scorched in the blazing sun,<br>
    Black lips that broke in a ghastly grin&mdash;<br>

  my dream&rsquo;s never soared<br>
    To the lonely position of Boss-of-the-board.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas a black-listed shed down the Darling: the Boss<br>
    Was a small man to see&mdash;though a big man to cross&mdash;<br>
    We had nought to complain of&mdash;except what we thought,<br>
    And the Boss didn&rsquo;t boss any more than he ought;<br>
    But the Union was booming, and Brotherhood soared,<br>
    So we hated like poison the Boss-of-the-board.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
  could tolerate &lsquo;hands&rsquo;&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
  respected the cook;<br>
    But the name of a Boss was a blot in our book.</p>
  <p>He&rsquo;d a row with Big Duggan&mdash;a rough sort of Jim&mdash;<br>
    Or, rather, Jim Duggan was &lsquo;laying for&rsquo; him!<br>
    His hate of Injustice and Greed was so deep<br>
    That his shearing grew rough&mdash;and he ill-used the sheep.<br>
    And I fancied that Duggan his manliness lower&rsquo;d<br>
    When he took off his shirt to the Boss-of-the-board,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
  the Boss was ten stone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  the shearer full-grown,<br>
    And he might have, they said, let the crawler alone.</p>
  <p>Though some of us there wished the fight to the strong,<br>
    Yet we knew in our hearts that the shearer was wrong.<br>
    And the crawler was plucky, it can&rsquo;t be denied,<br>
    For he had to fight Freedom and Justice beside,<br>
    But he came up so gamely, as often as floored,<br>
    That a blackleg stood up for the Boss-of-the-board!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  the fight was a sight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  we pondered that night&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;It&rsquo;s surprising how some of those blacklegs can fight!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Next day at the office, when sadly the wreck<br>
    Of Jim Duggan came up like a lamb for his cheque,<br>
    Said the Boss, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be childish! It&rsquo;s all past and gone;<br>
  &lsquo;I am short of good shearers. You&rsquo;d better stay on.&rsquo;<br>
    And we fancied Jim Duggan our dignity lower&rsquo;d<br>
    When he stopped to oblige a damned Boss-of-the-board.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
  said nothing to Jim,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
  a joke might be grim,<br>
    And the subject, we saw, was distasteful to him.</p>
  <p>The Boss just went on as he&rsquo;d done from the first,<br>
    And he favoured Big Duggan no more than the worst;<br>
    And when we&rsquo;d cut out and the steamer came down&mdash;<br>
    With the hawkers and spielers&mdash;to take us to town,<br>
    And we&rsquo;d all got aboard, &rsquo;twas Jim Duggan, good Lord!<br>
    Who yelled for three cheers for the Boss-of-the-board.<br>

  a bit off, no doubt&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  with Freedom about&mdash;<br>
    But a lot is forgot when a shed is cut out.</p>
  <p>With Freedom of Contract maintained in his shed,<br>
    And the curse of the Children of Light on his head,<br>
    He&rsquo;s apt to long sadly for sweetheart or wife,<br>
    And his views be inclined to the dark side of life.<br>
    The Truth must be spread and the Cause must be shored&mdash;<br>
    But it&rsquo;s just a bit rough on the Boss-of-the-board.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t cut &rsquo;em too bad. Don&rsquo;t
  swear.&rsquo;<br>
    The ghost of a pause in the shed&rsquo;s rough heart,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lower is bowed each head;<br>
    And nothing is heard, save a whispered word,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the roar of the shearing-shed.</p>
  <p>The tall, shy rouser has lost his wits,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his limbs are all astray;<br>
    He leaves a fleece on the shearing-board,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his broom in the shearer&rsquo;s way.<br>
    There&rsquo;s a curse in store for that jackaroo<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As down by the wall he slants&mdash;<br>
    And the ringer bends with his legs askew<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wishes he&rsquo;d &lsquo;patched them pants.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They are girls from the city. (Our hearts rebel<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we squint at their dainty feet.)<br>
    And they gush and say in a girly way<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That &lsquo;the dear little lambs&rsquo; are &lsquo;sweet.&rsquo;<br>
    And Bill, the ringer, who&rsquo;d scorn the use<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a childish word like &lsquo;damn,&rsquo;<br>
    Would give a pound that his tongue were loose<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he tackles a lively lamb.</p>
  <p>Swift thoughts of homes in the coastal towns&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or rivers and waving grass&mdash;<br>
    And a weight on our hearts that we cannot define<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That comes as the ladies pass.<br>
    But the rouser ventures a nervous dig<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ribs of the next to him;<br>
    And Barcoo says to his pen-mate: &lsquo;Twig<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The style of the last un, Jim.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Jim Moonlight gives her a careless glance&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he catches his breath with pain&mdash;<br>
    His strong hand shakes and the sunlights dance<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he bends to his work again.<br>
    But he&rsquo;s well disguised in a bristling beard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bronzed skin, and his shearer&rsquo;s dress;<br>
    And whatever Jim Moonlight hoped or feared<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were hard for his mates to guess.</p>
  <p>Jim Moonlight, wiping his broad, white brow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explains, with a doleful smile:<br>
  &lsquo;A stitch in the side,&rsquo; and &lsquo;he&rsquo;s all right now&rsquo;&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he leans on the beam awhile,<br>
    And gazes out in the blazing noon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the clearing, brown and bare&mdash;<br>
    She has come and gone, like a breath of June,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&rsquo;s heat and glare.</p>
  <p>The bushmen are big rough boys at the best,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hearts of a larger growth;<br>
    But they hide those hearts with a brutal jest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the pain with a reckless oath.<br>
    Though the Bills and Jims of the bush-bard sing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of their life loves, lost or dead,<br>
    The love of a girl is a sacred thing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not voiced in a shearing-shed.</p>

  <p>A&nbsp;rouseabout&nbsp;of rouseabouts, from any land&mdash;or none&mdash;<br>
    I bear a nick-name of the bush, and I&rsquo;m&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s son;<br>
    I came from where I camp&rsquo;d last night, and, at the day-dawn glow,<br>
    I rub the darkness from my eyes, roll up my swag, and go.</p>
  <p>Some take the track for bitter pride, some for no pride at all&mdash;<br>
    (But&mdash;to us all the world is wide when driven to the wall)<br>
    Some take the track for gain in life, some take the track for loss&mdash;<br>
    And some of us take up the swag as Christ took up the Cross.</p>
  <p>Some take the track for faith in men&mdash;some take the track for doubt&mdash;<br>
    Some flee a squalid home to work their own salvation out.<br>
    Some dared not see a mother&rsquo;s tears nor meet a father&rsquo;s face&mdash;<br>
    Born of good Christian families some leap, head-long, from Grace.</p>
  <p>Oh we are men who fought and rose, or fell from many grades;<br>
    Some born to lie, and some to pray, we&rsquo;re men of many trades;<br>
    We&rsquo;re men whose fathers were and are of high and low degree&mdash;<br>
    The sea was open to us and we sailed across the sea.</p>
  <p>And&mdash;were our quarrels wrong or just?&mdash;has no place in my song&mdash;<br>
    We seared our souls in puzzling as to what was right or wrong;<br>
    We judge not and we are not judged&mdash;&rsquo;tis our philosophy&mdash;<br>
    There&rsquo;s something wrong with every ship that sails upon the sea.</p>
  <p>From shearing shed to shearing shed we tramp to make a cheque&mdash;<br>
    Jack Cornstalk and the ne&rsquo;er-do-weel&mdash;the tar-boy and the wreck.<br>
    We learn the worth of man to man&mdash;and this we learn too well&mdash;<br>
    The shanty and the shearing shed are warmer spots in hell!</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve humped my swag to Bawley Plain, and further out and on;<br>
    I&rsquo;ve boiled my billy by the Gulf, and boiled it by the Swan&mdash;<br>
    I&rsquo;ve thirsted in dry lignum swamps, and thirsted on the sand,<br>
    And eked the fire with camel dung in Never-Never Land.</p>
  <p>I know the track from Spencer&rsquo;s Gulf and north of Cooper&rsquo;s Creek&mdash;<br>
    Where falls the half-caste to the strong, &lsquo;black velvet&rsquo; to the
    weak&mdash;<br>
    (From gold-top Flossie in the Strand to half-caste and the gin&mdash;<br>
    If they had brains, poor animals! we&rsquo;d teach them how to sin.)</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve tramped, and camped, and &lsquo;shore&rsquo; and drunk with many
    mates Out Back&mdash;<br>
    And every one to me is Jack because the first was Jack&mdash;<br>
    A &lsquo;lifer&rsquo; sneaked from jail at home&mdash;the &lsquo;straightest&rsquo; mate
    I met&mdash;<br>
    A &lsquo;ratty&rsquo; Russian Nihilist&mdash;a British Baronet!</p>
  <p>I know the tucker tracks that feed&mdash;or leave one in the lurch&mdash;<br>
    The &lsquo;Burgoo&rsquo; (Presbyterian) track&mdash;the &lsquo;Murphy&rsquo; (Roman
    Church)&mdash;<br>
    But more the&nbsp;<i>man</i>, and not the&nbsp;<i>track</i>, so much as it
    appears,<br>
    For &lsquo;battling&rsquo; is a trade to learn, and I&rsquo;ve served seven
    years.</p>
  <p>We&rsquo;re haunted by the past at times&mdash;and this is very bad,<br>
    And so we drink till horrors come, lest, sober, we go mad&mdash;<br>
    So much is lost Out Back, so much of hell is realised&mdash;<br>
    A man might skin himself alive and no one be surprised.</p>
  <p>A rouseabout of rouseabouts, above&mdash;beneath regard,<br>
    I know how soft is this old world, and I have learnt, how hard&mdash;<br>
    A rouseabout of rouseabouts&mdash;I know what men can feel,<br>
    I&rsquo;ve seen the tears from hard eyes slip as drops from polished steel.</p>
  <p>I learned what college had to teach, and in the school of men<br>
    By camp-fires I have learned, or, say, unlearned it all again;<br>
    But this I&rsquo;ve learned, that truth is strong, and if a man go straight<br>
    He&rsquo;ll live to see his enemy struck down by time and fate!</p>
  <p>We hold him true who&rsquo;s true to one however false he be<br>
    (There&rsquo;s something wrong with every ship that lies beside the quay);<br>
    We lend and borrow, laugh and joke, and when the past is drowned,<br>
    We sit upon our swags and smoke and watch the world go round.</p>

  but that&rsquo;s red-hot!&rsquo;<br>
  &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Bill the Slogger&mdash;poor bloke&mdash;he&rsquo;s done.
  A chunk of the shell was his;<br>
  &lsquo;I wish the be beggar that fired that gun could get within reach of Liz.&rsquo;<br>
  &lsquo;Those foreign gunners will give us rats, but I wish it was Bill they
  missed.&rsquo;<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to get at their bleeding hats with a rock in my (something)
  fist.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Hold up, Billy; I&rsquo;ll stick to you; they&rsquo;ve hit you under
    the belt;<br>
  &lsquo;If we get the waddle I&rsquo;ll swag you through, if the blazing mountains
  melt;<br>
  &lsquo;You remember the night when the traps got me for stoushing a bleeding
  Chow,<br>
  &lsquo;And you went for &rsquo;em proper and laid out three, and I won&rsquo;t
  forget it now.&rsquo;<br>
    And, groaning and swearing, the pug replied: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m done . . .
    they&rsquo;ve knocked me out!<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;d fight them all for a pound a-side, from the boss to the rouseabout.<br>
  &lsquo;My nut is cracked and my legs is broke, and it gives me worse than hell;<br>
  &lsquo;I trained for a scrap with a twelve-stone bloke, and not with a bursting
  shell.<br>
  &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t mag, for I knowed, old chum, I knowed, old pal, you&rsquo;d
  stick;<br>
  &lsquo;But you can&rsquo;t hold out till the reg&rsquo;lars come, and you&rsquo;d
  best be nowhere quick.<br>
  &lsquo;They&rsquo;ve got a force and a gun ashore, both of our wings is broke;<br>
  &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll storm the ridge in a minute more, and the best you can
  do is smoke.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And Jim exclaimed: &lsquo;You can smoke, you chaps, but me&mdash;Gor&rsquo; bli&rsquo;me,
    no!<br>
  &lsquo;The push that ran from the George-street traps won&rsquo;t run from
  a foreign foe.<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll stick to the gun while she makes them sick, and I&rsquo;ll
  stick to what&rsquo;s left of Bill.&rsquo;<br>
    And they hiss through their blackened teeth: &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll stick! by
    the blazing flame, we will!&rsquo;<br>
    And long years after the war was past, they told in the town and bush<br>
    How the ridge of death to the bloody last was held by a Sydney push;<br>
    How they fought to the end in a sheet of flame, how they fought with their
    rifle-stocks,<br>
    And earned, in a nobler sense, the name of their ancient weapons&mdash;&lsquo;rocks.&rsquo;</p>

    If the enemy&rsquo;s forces take the coast, they must take the mountains,
    too;<br>
  &lsquo;They may force their way by the western line or round by a northern
  track,<br>
    But they won&rsquo;t run short of a decent spree with the men who are left
    out back!&rsquo;<br>
    When we burst the enemy&rsquo;s ironclads and won by a run of luck,<br>
    We whooped as loudly as Nelson&rsquo;s lads when a French three-decker struck&mdash;<br>
    And when the enemy&rsquo;s troops prevailed the truth was never heard&mdash;<br>
    We lied like heroes who never failed explaining how that occurred.</p>
  <p>You bushmen sneer in the old bush way at the new-chum jackeroo,<br>
    But &lsquo;cuffs-&rsquo;n&rsquo;-collers&rsquo; were out that day, and they
    stuck to their posts like glue;<br>
    I never believed that a dude could fight till a Johnny led us then;<br>
    We buried his bits in the rear that night for the honour of George-street
    men.<br>
    And Jim the Ringer&mdash;he fought, he did. The regiment nicknamed Jim,<br>
  &lsquo;Old Heads a Caser&rsquo; and &lsquo;Heads a Quid,&rsquo; but it never
  was &lsquo;tails&rsquo; with him.<br>
    The way that he rode was a racing rhyme, and the way that he finished grand;<br>
    He backed the enemy every time, and died in a hand-to-hand!</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>I&rsquo;ll never forget when the ringer and I were first in the Bush Brigade,<br>
    With Warrego Bill, from the Live-till-you-Die, in the last grand charge we
      made.<br>
    And Billy died&mdash;he was full of sand&mdash;he said, as I raised his head:<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;m full of love for my native land, but a lot too full of lead.<br>
  &lsquo;Tell &rsquo;em,&rsquo; said Billy, &lsquo;and tell old dad, to look
  after the cattle pup;&rsquo;<br>
    But his eyes grew bright, though his voice was sad, and he said, as I held
    him up:<br>
  &lsquo;I have been happy on western farms. And once, when I first went wrong,<br>
  &lsquo;Around my neck were the trembling arms of the girl I&rsquo;d loved so
  long.<br>
  &lsquo;Far out on the southern seas I&rsquo;ve sailed, and ridden where brumbies
  roam,<br>
  &lsquo;And oft, when all on the station failed, I&rsquo;ve driven the outlaw
  home.<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve spent a cheque in a day and night, and I&rsquo;ve made a
  cheque as quick;<br>
  &lsquo;I struck a nugget when times were tight, and the stores had stopped
  our tick.<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve led the field on the old bay mare, and I hear the cheering
  still,<br>
  &lsquo;When mother and sister and she were there, and the old man yelled for
  Bill;<br>
  &lsquo;But, save for her, could I live my while again in the old bush way,<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;d give it all for the last half-mile in the race we rode to-day!&rsquo;<br>
    And he passed away as the stars came out&mdash;he died as old heroes die&mdash;<br>
    I heard the sound of the distant rout, and the Southern Cross was high.</p>

  <p><i>The sky is brass and the scrub-lands glare,<br>
    Death and ruin are everywhere;<br>
    Thrown high to bleach, or deep in the mud<br>
    The bones lie buried by last year&rsquo;s flood,<br>
    And the Demons dance from the Never Never<br>
    To laugh at the rise of the Darling River.</i></p>

    The moon hangs caught in a silvery veil,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From clouds of a steely grey,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wonderful Milky Way.</p>

  <p>We fought with the strength of the moral right, and they, as their ships

    drown.<br>
    It mattered little what chance or hope, for ever their path was plain,<br>

  <p>Over there, above the jetty, stands the mansion of the Vardens,<br>
    With a tennis ground and terrace, and a flagstaff in the gardens:<br>
    They are gentlemen and ladies &mdash; they&rsquo;ve been &lsquo;toffs&rsquo; for
    generations,<br>
    But old Varden&rsquo;s been unlucky &mdash; lost a lot in speculations.</p>
  <p>Troubles gathered fast upon him when the mining bubble &lsquo;busted,&rsquo;<br>
    Then the bank suspended payment, where his little all he trusted;<br>
    And the butcher and the baker sent their bills in when they read it,<br>
    Even John, the Chow that served him, has refused to give him &lsquo;cledit.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And the daughters of the Vardens &mdash; they are beautiful as Graces &mdash;<br>
    But the balcony&rsquo;s deserted, and they rarely show their faces;<br>
    And the swells of their acquaintance never seem to venture near them,<br>
    And the bailiff says they seldom have a cup of tea to cheer them.</p>
  <p>They were butterflies &mdash; I always was a common caterpillar,<br>
    But I&rsquo;m sorry for the ladies over there in &rsquo;Tony Villa,<br>
    Shut up there in &rsquo;Tony Villa with the bailiff and their trouble;<br>
    And the dried-up reservoir, where my tears were seems to bubble.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Rooney thinks it nothing when she sends a brat to &lsquo;borry&rsquo;<br>
    Just a pinch of tea and sugar till the grocer comes &lsquo;temorry;&rsquo;<br>
    But it&rsquo;s dif&rsquo;rent with the Vardens &mdash; they would starve
    to death as soon as<br>
    Knuckle down. You know, they weren&rsquo;t raised exactly like the Rooneys!</p>
  <p>There is gossip in the &lsquo;boxes&rsquo; and the drawing-rooms and gardens &mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Have you heard of Varden&rsquo;s failure? Have you heard about the Vardens?&rsquo;<br>
    And no doubt each toney mother on the Point across the water&rsquo;s<br>
    Mighty glad about the downfall of the rivals of her daughters.</p>
  <p>(Tho&rsquo; the poets and the writers say that man to man&rsquo;s inhuman,<br>
    I&rsquo;m inclined to think it&rsquo;s nothing to what woman is to woman,<br>
    More especially, the ladies, save perhaps a fellow&rsquo;s mother;<br>
    And I think that men are better &mdash; they are kinder to each other.)</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a youngster by the jetty gathering cinders from the ashes,<br>
    He was known as &lsquo;Master Varden&rsquo; ere the great financial crashes.<br>
    And his manner shows the dif&rsquo;rence &rsquo;twixt the nurs&rsquo;ry and
    gutter &mdash;<br>
    But I&rsquo;ve seen him at the grocer&rsquo;s buying half a pound of butter.</p>
  <p>And his mother fights her trouble in the house across the water,<br>
    She is just as proud as Varden, though she was a &lsquo;cocky&rsquo;s&rsquo; daughter;<br>
    And at times I think I see her with the flick&rsquo;ring firelight o&rsquo;er
    her,<br>
    Sitting pale and straight and quiet, gazing vacantly before her.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a slight and girlish figure &mdash; Varden&rsquo;s youngest
    daughter, Nettie &mdash;<br>
    On the terrace after sunset, when the boat is near the jetty;<br>
    She is good and pure and pretty, and her rivals don&rsquo;t deny it,<br>
    Though they say that Nettie Varden takes in sewing on the quiet.</p>
  <p>(How her sister graced the &lsquo;circle,&rsquo; all unconscious of a lover<br>
    In the seedy &lsquo;god&rsquo; who watched her from the gallery above her!<br>
    Shade of Poverty was on him, and the light of Wealth upon her,<br>
    But perhaps he loved her better than the swells attending on her.)</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a white man&rsquo;s heart in Varden, spite of all the blue
    blood in him,<br>
    There are working men who wouldn&rsquo;t stand and hear a word agin&rsquo; him;<br>
    But his name was never printed by the side of his &lsquo;donations,&rsquo;<br>
    Save on hearts that have &mdash; in this world &mdash; very humble circulations.</p>
  <p>He was never stiff or hoggish &mdash; he was affable and jolly,<br>
    And he&rsquo;d always say &lsquo;Good morning&rsquo; to the deck hand on
    the &lsquo;Polly;&rsquo;<br>
    He would &lsquo;barrack&rsquo; with the newsboys on the Quay across the ferry,<br>
    And he&rsquo;d very often tip &rsquo;em coming home a trifle merry.</p>
  <p>But his chin is getting higher, and his features daily harden<br>
    (He will not &lsquo;give up possession&rsquo; &mdash; there&rsquo;s a lot
    of fight in Varden);<br>
    And the way he steps the gangway! oh, you couldn&rsquo;t but admire it!<br>
    Just as proud as ever hero walked the plank aboard a pirate!</p>
  <p>He will think about the hardships that his girls were never &lsquo;useter,&rsquo;<br>
    And it must be mighty heavy on the thoroughbred old rooster;<br>
    But he&rsquo;ll never strike his colours, and I tell a lying tale if<br>
    Varden&rsquo;s pride don&rsquo;t kill him sooner than the bankers or the
    bailiff.</p>
  <p>You remember when we often had to go without our dinners,<br>
    In the days when Pride and Hunger fought a finish out within us;<br>
    And how Pride would come up groggy &mdash; Hunger whooping loud and louder &mdash;<br>
    And the swells are proud as we are; they are just as proud &mdash; and prouder.</p>
  <p>Yes, the toffs have grit, in spite of all our sneering and our scorning &mdash;<br>
    What&rsquo;s the crowd? What&rsquo;s that? God help us! &mdash; Varden shot
    himself this morning! . . . .<br>
    There&rsquo;ll be gossip in the &lsquo;circle,&rsquo; in the drawing-rooms
    and gardens;<br>
    But I&rsquo;m sorry for the family; yes I&rsquo;m sorry for the Vardens.</p>

    Yet they wait beneath a signboard, sneering &lsquo;Second class wait here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I have waited oft in winter, in the mornings dark and damp,<br>

    Ghastly on the brick-faced cutting &lsquo;Sellum&rsquo;s Soap&rsquo; and &lsquo;Blower&rsquo;s

    Ghastly on enamelled signboards with their &lsquo;Second class wait here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And the others seemed like burglars, slouched and muffled to the throats,<br>
    Standing round apart and silent in their shoddy overcoats,<br>
    And the wind among the wires, and the poplars bleak and bare,<br>
    Seemed to be for ever snarling, snarling &lsquo;Second class wait there.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Out beyond the further suburb, &rsquo;neath a chimney stack alone,<br>
    Lay the works of Grinder Brothers, with a platform of their own;<br>
    And I waited there and suffered, waited there for many a year,<br>
    Slaved beneath a phantom signboard, telling our class to wait here.</p>
  <p>Ah! a man must feel revengeful for a boyhood such as mine.<br>
    God! I hate the very houses near the workshop by the line;<br>
    And the smell of railway stations, and the roar of running gear,<br>
    And the scornful-seeming signboards, saying &lsquo;Second class wait here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a train with Death for driver, which is ever going past,<br>
    And there are no class compartments, and we all must go at last<br>
    To the long white jasper platform with an Eden in the rear;<br>

  <p>So, sit you down in a straight-backed chair, with your pipe and your wife
    content,<br>
    And cross your knees with your wisest air, and preach of the &lsquo;days
    mis-spent;&rsquo;<br>
    Grown fat and moral apace, old man! you prate of the change &lsquo;since
    then&rsquo; &mdash;<br>
    In spite of all, I&rsquo;d as lief be back in those hard old days again.</p>
  <p>They were hard old days; they were battling days; they were cruel at times &mdash; but
    then,<br>
    In spite of all, I would rather be back in those hard old days again.<br>
    The land was barren to sow wild oats in the days when we sowed our own &mdash;<br>
    (&rsquo;Twas little we thought or our friends believed that ours would ever
    be sown)<br>
    But the wild oats wave on their stormy path, and they speak of the hearts
    of men &mdash;<br>
    I would sow a crop if I had my time in those hard old days again.</p>
  <p>We travel first, or we go saloon &mdash; on the planned-out trips we go,<br>
    With those who are neither rich nor poor, and we find that the life is slow;<br>
    It&rsquo;s &lsquo;a pleasant trip&rsquo; where they cried, &lsquo;Good luck!
    There was fun in the steerage then &mdash;<br>
    In spite of all, I would fain be back in those vagabond days again.</p>
  <p>On Saturday night we&rsquo;ve a pound to spare &mdash;  a pound for a trip
    down town &mdash;<br>
    We took more joy in those hard old days for a hardly spared half-crown;<br>
    We took more pride in the pants we patched than the suits we have had since
    then &mdash;<br>
    In spite of all, I would rather be back in those comical days again.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas We and the World &mdash; and the rest go hang &mdash; as the
    Outside tracks we trod;<br>
    Each thought of himself as a man and mate, and not as a martyred god;<br>
    The world goes wrong when your heart is strong &mdash; and this is the way
    with men &mdash;<br>
    The world goes right when your liver is white, and you preach of the change  &lsquo;since
    then.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They were hard old days; they were battling days; they were cruel times &mdash; but

  <p>So the days of my tramping are over,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the days of my riding are done &mdash;<br>
    I&rsquo;m about as content as a rover<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will ever be under the sun;<br>
    I write, after reading your letter &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My pipe with old memories rife &mdash;<br>
    And I feel in a mood that had better<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not meet the true eyes of the wife.</p>
  <p>You must never admit a suggestion<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That old things are good to recall;<br>
    You must never consider the question:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Was I happier then, after all?&rsquo;<br>
    You must banish the old hope and sorrow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That make the sad pleasures of life,<br>
    You must live for To-day and To-morrow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to be just to the wife.</p>
  <p>I have changed since the first day I kissed her.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is due &mdash; Heaven bless her! &mdash; to her;<br>
    I&rsquo;m respected and trusted &mdash; I&rsquo;m &lsquo;Mister,&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Addressed by the children as &lsquo;Sir.&rsquo;<br>
    And I feel the respect without feigning &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you&rsquo;d laugh the great laugh of your life<br>
    If you only saw me entertaining<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old lady friend of the wife.</p>
  <p>By-the-way, when you&rsquo;re writing, remember<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you never went drinking with me,<br>
    And forget our last night of December,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest our sev&rsquo;ral accounts disagree.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid the old language of strife,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May be misunderstood by the wife.</p>
  <p>Never hint of the girls appertaining<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the past (when you&rsquo;re writing again),<br>
    For they take such a lot of explaining,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you know how I hate to explain.<br>
    There are some things, we know to our sorrow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That cut to the heart like a knife,<br>
    And your past is To-day and To-morrow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to be true to the wife.</p>
  <p>I believe that the creed we were chums in<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was grand, but too abstract and bold,<br>
    And the knowledge of life only comes in<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you&rsquo;re married and fathered and old.<br>
    And it&rsquo;s well. You may travel as few men,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may stick to a mistress for life;<br>
    But the world, as it is, born of woman<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must be seen through the eyes of the wife.</p>
  <p>No doubt you are dreaming as&nbsp;<i>I</i>&nbsp;did<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And going the careless old pace,<br>
    While my future grows dull and decided,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the world narrows down to the Place.<br>
    Let it be. If my &lsquo;treason&rsquo;s&rsquo; resented,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>You</i>&nbsp;may do worse, old man, in your life;<br>

  <h2 align="center"><a name="TheWritersDream"></a>The Writer&rsquo;s Dream </h2>
  <p>A writer wrote of the hearts of men, and he followed their tracks afar;<br>
    For his was a spirit that forced his pen to write of the things that are.<br>
    His heart grew tired of the truths he told, for his life was hard and grim;<br>
    His land seemed barren, its people cold &mdash; yet the world was dear to
    him; &mdash;<br>
    So he sailed away from the Streets of Strife, he travelled by land and sea,<br>
    In search of a people who lived a life as life in the world should be.</p>
  <p>And he reached a spot where the scene was fair, with forest and field and
    wood,<br>
    And all things came with the seasons there, and each of its kind was good;<br>
    There were mountain-rivers and peaks of snow, there were lights of green
    and gold,<br>
    And echoing caves in the cliffs below, where a world-wide ocean rolled.<br>
    The lives of men from the wear of Change and the strife of the world were
    free  &mdash;<br>
    For Steam was barred by the mountain-range and the rocks of the Open Sea.</p>
  <p>And the last that were born of a noble race &mdash; when the page of the
    South was fair &mdash;<br>
    The last of the conquered dwelt in peace with the last of the victors there.<br>
    He saw their hearts with the author&rsquo;s eyes who had written their ancient
    lore,<br>
    And he saw their lives as he&rsquo;d dreamed of such &mdash; ah! many a year
    before.<br>
    And &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll write a book of these simple folk ere I to the world
    return,<br>
  &lsquo;And the cold who read shall be kind for these &mdash; and the wise who
  read shall learn.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Never again in a song of mine shall a jarring note be heard:<br>
  &lsquo;Never again shall a page or line be marred by a bitter word;<br>
  &lsquo;But love and laughter and kindly hours will the book I&rsquo;ll write
  recall,<br>
  &lsquo;With chastening tears for the loss of one, and sighs for their sorrows
  all.<br>
  &lsquo;Old eyes will light with a kindly smile, and the young eyes dance with
  glee &mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;And the heart of the cynic will rest awhile for my simple folk and me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The lines ran on as he dipped his pen &mdash; ran true to his heart and
    ear &mdash;<br>
    Like the brighter pages of memory when every line is clear.<br>
    The pictures came and the pictures passed, like days of love and light &mdash;<br>
    He saw his chapters from first to last, and he thought it grand to write.<br>
    And the writer kissed his girlish wife, and he kissed her twice for pride:<br>
  &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a book of love, though a book of life! and a book&nbsp;<i>you&rsquo;ll</i>&nbsp;read!&rsquo;  he
  cried.</p>
  <p>He was blind at first to each senseless slight (for shabby and poor he came)<br>
    From local &lsquo;Fashion&rsquo; and mortgaged pride that scarce could sign
    its name.<br>
    What dreamer would dream of such paltry pride in a scene so fresh and fair?<br>
    But the local spirit intensified &mdash; with its pitiful shams &mdash; was
    there;<br>
    There were cliques wherever two houses stood (no rest for a family ghost!)<br>
    They hated each other as women could &mdash; but they hated the stranger
    most.</p>
  <p>The writer wrote by day and night and he cried in the face of Fate  &mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll cleave to my dream of life in spite of the cynical ghosts
  that wait.<br>
  &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis the shyness born of their simple lives,&rsquo; he said to
  the paltry pride &mdash;<br>
    (The homely tongues of the simple wives ne&rsquo;er erred on the generous
    side) &mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll prove me true and they&rsquo;ll prove me kind ere the
  year of grace be passed,&rsquo;<br>
    But the ignorant whisper of &lsquo;axe to grind!&rsquo; went home to his
    heart at last.</p>
  <p>The writer sat by his drift-wood fire three nights of the South-east gale,<br>
    His pen lay idle on pages vain, for his book was a fairy tale.<br>
    The world-wise lines of an elder age were plain on his aching brow,<br>
    As he sadly thought of each brighter page that would never be written now.<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll write no more!&rsquo; But he bowed his head, for his heart
  was in Dreamland yet  &mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;The pages written I&rsquo;ll burn,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and the pages
  thought forget.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But he heard the hymn of the Open Sea, and the old fierce anger burned,<br>
    And he wrenched his heart from its dreamland free as the fire of his youth
      returned:&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;The weak man&rsquo;s madness, the strong man&rsquo;s scorn &mdash; the
  rebellious hate of youth<br>
  &lsquo;From a deeper love of the world are born! And the cynical ghost is Truth!&rsquo;<br>
    And the writer rose with a strength anew wherein Doubt could have no part;<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll write my book and it&nbsp;<i>shall</i>&nbsp;be true &mdash; the
  truth of a writer&rsquo;s heart.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ay! cover the wrong with a fairy tale &mdash; who never knew want
    or care &mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;A bright green scum on a stagnant pool that will reek the longer there.<br>
  &lsquo;You may starve the writer and buy the pen &mdash; you may drive it with
  want and fear &mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;But the lines run false in the hearts of men &mdash; and false to the
  writer&rsquo;s ear.<br>
  &lsquo;The bard&rsquo;s a rebel and strife his part, and he&rsquo;ll burst
  from his bonds anew,<br>
  &lsquo;Till all pens write from a single heart! And so may the dream come true.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis ever the same in the paths of men where money and dress
    are all,<br>
  &lsquo;The crawler will bully whene&rsquo;er he can, and the bully who can&rsquo;t
  will crawl.<br>
  &lsquo;And this is the creed in the local hole, where the souls of the selfish
  rule;<br>
  &lsquo;Borrow and cheat while the stranger&rsquo;s green, then sneer at the
  simple fool.<br>
  &lsquo;Spit your spite at the men whom Fate has placed in the head-race first,<br>
  &lsquo;And hate till death, with a senseless hate, the man you have injured
  worst!</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There are generous hearts in the grinding street, but the Hearts
    of the World go west;<br>
  &lsquo;For the men who toil in the dust and heat of the barren lands are best!<br>
  &lsquo;The stranger&rsquo;s hand to the stranger, yet &mdash; for a roving
  folk are mine &mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;The stranger&rsquo;s store for the stranger set &mdash; and the camp-fire
  glow the sign!<br>
  &lsquo;The generous hearts of the world, we find, thrive best on the barren
  sod,<br>
  &lsquo;And the selfish thrive where Nature&rsquo;s kind (they&rsquo;d bully
  or crawl to God!)</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I was born to write of the things that are! and the strength was
    given to me.<br>
  &lsquo;I was born to strike at the things that mar the world as the world should
  be!<br>
  &lsquo;By the dumb heart-hunger and dreams of youth, by the hungry tracks I&rsquo;ve
  trod &mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll fight as a man for the sake of truth, nor pose as a martyred
  god.<br>
  &lsquo;By the heart of &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; and the heart of &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; and
  the men that&nbsp;<i>their</i>&nbsp;hearts deem &ldquo;white,&rdquo;<br>
  &lsquo;By the handgrips fierce, and the hard eyes dim with forbidden tears! &mdash; I&rsquo;ll
  write!</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll write untroubled by cultured fools, or the dense that
    fume and fret &mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;For against the wisdom of all their schools I would stake mine instinct
  yet!<br>
  &lsquo;For the cynical strain in the writer&rsquo;s song is the&nbsp;<i>world</i>,
  not&nbsp;<i>he</i>, to blame,<br>
  &lsquo;And I&rsquo;ll write as I think, in the knowledge strong that thousands
  think the same;<br>
  &lsquo;And the men who fight in the Dry Country grim battles by day, by night,<br>
  &lsquo;Will believe in me, and will stand by me, and will say to the world, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s

  <p>Once&nbsp;I wrote a little poem which I thought was very fine,<br>
    And I showed the printer&rsquo;s copy to a critic friend of mine,<br>
    First he praised the thing a little, then he found a little fault;<br>
  &lsquo;The ideas are good,&rsquo; he muttered, &lsquo;but the rhythm seems
  to halt.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>So I straighten&rsquo;d up the rhythm where he marked it with his pen,<br>
    And I copied it and showed it to my clever friend again.<br>
  &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve improved the metre greatly, but the rhymes are bad,&rsquo; he
  said,<br>
    As he read it slowly, scratching surplus wisdom from his head.</p>
  <p>So I worked as he suggested (I believe in taking time),<br>
    And I burnt the &lsquo;midnight taper&rsquo; while I straightened up the
    rhyme.<br>
  &lsquo;It is better now,&rsquo; he muttered, &lsquo;you go on and you&rsquo;ll
  succeed,<br>
  &lsquo;It has got a ring about it&mdash;the ideas are what you need.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>So I worked for hours upon it (I go on when I commence),<br>
    And I kept in view the rhythm and the jingle and the sense,<br>
    And I copied it and took it to my solemn friend once more&mdash;<br>
    It reminded him of something he had somewhere read before.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>Now the people say I&rsquo;d never put such horrors into print<br>
    If I wasn&rsquo;t too conceited to accept a friendly hint,<br>
    And my dearest friends are certain that I&rsquo;d profit in the end<br>
    If I&rsquo;d always show my copy to a literary friend.</p>

  <p>They&rsquo;d&nbsp;parted but a year before&mdash;she never thought he&rsquo;d
    come,<br>
    She stammer&rsquo;d, blushed, held out her hand, and called him &lsquo;<i>Mister</i>&nbsp;Gum.&rsquo;<br>
    How could he know that all the while she longed to murmur &lsquo;John.&rsquo;<br>
    He called her &lsquo;Miss le Brook,&rsquo; and asked how she was getting
    on.</p>
  <p>They&rsquo;d parted but a year before; they&rsquo;d loved each other well,<br>
    But he&rsquo;d been to the city, and he came back such a swell.<br>
    They longed to meet in fond embrace, they hungered for a kiss&mdash;<br>
    But Mary called him &lsquo;Mister,&rsquo; and the idiot called her &lsquo;Miss.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He stood and lean&rsquo;d against the door&mdash;a stupid chap was he&mdash;<br>
    And, when she asked if he&rsquo;d come in and have a cup of tea,<br>
    He looked to left, he looked to right, and then he glanced behind,<br>
    And slowly doffed his cabbage-tree, and said he &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She made a shy apology because the meat was tough,<br>
    And then she asked if he was sure his tea was sweet enough;<br>
    He stirred the tea and sipped it twice, and answer&rsquo;d &lsquo;plenty,
    quite;&rsquo;<br>
    And cut the smallest piece of beef and said that it was &lsquo;right.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She glanced at him at times and cough&rsquo;d an awkward little cough;<br>
    He stared at anything but her and said, &lsquo;I must be off.&rsquo;<br>
    That evening he went riding north&mdash;a sad and lonely ride&mdash;<br>
    She locked herself inside her room, and there sat down and cried.</p>
  <p>They&rsquo;d parted but a year before, they loved each other well&mdash;<br>
    But she was such a country girl and he was such a swell;<br>
    They longed to meet in fond embrace, they hungered for a kiss&mdash;<br>
    But Mary called him &lsquo;Mister&rsquo; and the idiot called her &lsquo;Miss.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>She&nbsp;says she&rsquo;s very sorry, as she sees you to the gate;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You calmly say &lsquo;Good-bye&rsquo; to her while
  standing off a yard,<br>
    Then you lift your hat and leave her, walking mighty stiff and straight&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you&rsquo;re hit, old man&mdash;hit hard.</p>
  <p>In your brain the words are burning of the answer that she gave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you turn the nearest corner and you stagger just
  a bit;<br>
    But you pull yourself together, for a man&rsquo;s strong heart is brave<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it&rsquo;s hit, old man&mdash;hard hit.</p>
  <p>You might try to drown the sorrow, but the drink has no effect;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot stand the barmaid with her coarse and vulgar
  wit;<br>
    And so you seek the street again, and start for home direct,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you&rsquo;re hit, old man&mdash;hard hit.</p>
  <p>You see the face of her you lost, the pity in her smile&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! she is to the barmaid as is snow to chimney grit;<br>
    You&rsquo;re a better man and nobler in your sorrow, for a while,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you&rsquo;re hit, old man&mdash;hard hit.</p>
  <p>And, arriving at your lodgings, with a face of deepest gloom,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shun the other boarders and your manly brow you
  knit;<br>
    You take a light and go upstairs directly to your room&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the whole house knows you&rsquo;re hit.</p>
  <p>You clutch the scarf and collar, and you tear them from your throat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You rip your waistcoat open like a fellow in a fit;<br>
    And you fling them in a corner with the made-to-order coat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you&rsquo;re hit, old man&mdash;hard hit.</p>
  <p>You throw yourself, despairing, on your narrow little bed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or pace the room till someone starts with &lsquo;Skit!
  cat!&mdash;skit!&rsquo;<br>
    And then lie blindly staring at the plaster overhead&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are hit, old man&mdash;hard hit.</p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s doubtful whether vanity or love has suffered worst,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So neatly in our nature are those feelings interknit,<br>
    Your heart keeps swelling up so bad, you wish that it would burst,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you&rsquo;re hit, old man&mdash;hard hit.</p>
  <p>You think and think, and think, and think, till you go mad almost;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across your sight the spectres of the bygone seem to
  flit;<br>
    The very girl herself seems dead, and comes back as a ghost,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you&rsquo;re hit, like this&mdash;hard hit.</p>
  <p>You know that it&rsquo;s all over&mdash;you&rsquo;re an older man by years,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future not a twinkle, in your black sky not
  a split.<br>
    Ah! you&rsquo;ll think it well that women have the privilege of tears,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you&rsquo;re hit, old man&mdash;hard hit.</p>
  <p>You long and hope for nothing but the rest that sleep can bring,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you find that in the morning things have brightened
  up a bit;<br>
    But you&rsquo;re dull for many evenings, with a cracked heart in a sling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you&rsquo;re hit, old man&mdash;hard hit.</p>

  <p>James Patrick O&rsquo;Hara, the Justice of Peace,<br>
    He bossed the P.M. and he bossed the police;<br>
    A parent, a deacon, a landlord was he&mdash;<br>
    A townsman of weight was O&rsquo;Hara, J.P.</p>
  <p>He gave out the prizes, foundation-stones laid,<br>
    He shone when the Governor&rsquo;s visit was paid;<br>
    And twice re-elected as Mayor was he&mdash;<br>
    The flies couldn&rsquo;t roost on O&rsquo;Hara, J.P.</p>
  <p>Now Sandy M&lsquo;Fly, of the Axe-and-the-Saw,<br>
    Was charged with a breach of the licensing law&mdash;<br>
    He sold after hours whilst talking too free<br>
    On matters concerning O&rsquo;Hara, J.P.</p>
  <p>And each contradicted the next witness flat,<br>
    Concerning back parlours, side-doors, and all that;<br>
  &lsquo;Twas very conflicting, as all must agree&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Ye&rsquo;d better take care!&rsquo; said O&rsquo;Hara, J.P.</p>
  <p>But &lsquo;Baby,&rsquo; the barmaid, her evidence gave&mdash;<br>
    A poor, timid darling who tried to be brave&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Now,&nbsp;<i>don&rsquo;t</i>&nbsp;be afraid&mdash;if it&rsquo;s frightened
  ye be&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Speak out, my good girl,&rsquo; said O&rsquo;Hara, J.P.</p>
  <p>Her hair was so golden, her eyes were so blue,<br>
    Her face was so fair and her words seemed so true&mdash;<br>
    So green in the ways of sweet women was he<br>
    That she jolted the heart of O&rsquo;Hara, J P.</p>
  <p>He turned to the other grave Justice of Peace,<br>
    And whispered, &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t always trust the police;<br>
  &lsquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll visit the premises during the day,<br>
  &lsquo;And see for myself,</i>&rsquo; said O&rsquo;Hara, Jay Pay.</p>
  <p align="center">(<i>Case postponed.</i>)</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas early next morning, or late the same night&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;&rsquo;Twas early next morning&rsquo; we think would be right&mdash;<br>
    And sounds that betokened a breach of the law<br>
    Escaped through the cracks of the Axe-and-the-Saw.</p>
  <p>And Constable Dogherty, out in the street,<br>
    Met Constable Clancy a bit off his beat;<br>
    He took him with finger and thumb by the ear,<br>
    And led him around to a lane in the rear.</p>
  <p>He pointed a blind where strange shadows were seen&mdash;<br>
    Wild pantomime hinting of revels within&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll drop on M&lsquo;Fly, if you&rsquo;ll listen to me,<br>
  &lsquo;And prove we are right to O&rsquo;Hara, J. P.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But Clancy was up to the lay of the land,<br>
    He cautiously shaded his mouth with his hand&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Wisht, man! Howld yer whisht! or it&rsquo;s ruined we&rsquo;ll be,<br>
  &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the justice himself&mdash;it&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Hara, J.P.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They hish&rsquo;d and they whishted, and turned themselves round,<br>
    And got themselves off like two cats on wet ground;<br>
    Agreeing to be, on their honour as men,<br>
    A deaf-dumb-and-blind institution just then.</p>
  <p>Inside on a sofa, two barmaids between,<br>
    With one on his knee was a gentleman seen;<br>
    And any chance eye at the keyhole could see<br>
    In less than a wink &rsquo;twas O&rsquo;Hara, J.P.</p>
  <p>The first in the chorus of songs that were sung,<br>
    The loudest that laughed at the jokes that were sprung,<br>
    The guest of the evening, the soul of the spree&mdash;<br>
    The daddy of all was O&rsquo;Hara, J.P.</p>
  <p>And hard-cases chuckled, and hard-cases said<br>
    That Baby and Alice conveyed him to bed&mdash;<br>
    In subsequent storms it was painful to see<br>
    Those hard-cases side with the sinful J.P.</p>
  <p>Next day, in the court, when the case came in sight,<br>
    O&rsquo;Hara declared he was satisfied quite;<br>
    The case was dismissed&mdash;it was destined to be<br>
    The final case of O&rsquo;Hara, J.P.</p>
  <p>The law and religion came down on him first&mdash;<br>
    The Christian was hard but his wife was the worst!<br>
    Half ruined and half driven crazy was he&mdash;<br>
    It made an old man of O&rsquo;Hara, J. P.</p>
  <p>Now, young men who come from the bush, do you hear?<br>
    Who know not the power of barmaids and beer&mdash;<br>
  <i>Don&rsquo;t see for yourself!</i>&nbsp;from temptation steer free,<br>

  <p>Bill&nbsp;and Jim are mates no longer&mdash;they would scorn the name of
    mate&mdash;<br>
    Those two bushmen hate each other with a soul-consuming hate;<br>
    Yet erstwhile they were as brothers should be (tho&rsquo; they never will):<br>
    Ne&rsquo;er were mates to one another half so true as Jim and Bill.</p>
  <p>Bill was one of those who have to argue every day or die&mdash;<br>
    Though, of course, he swore &rsquo;twas Jim who always itched to argufy.<br>
    They would, on most abstract subjects, contradict each other flat<br>
    And at times in lurid language&mdash;they were mates in spite of that.</p>
  <p>Bill believed the Bible story&nbsp;<i>re</i>&nbsp;the origin of him&mdash;<br>
    He was sober, he was steady, he was orthodox; while Jim,<br>
    Who, we grieve to state, was always getting into drunken scrapes,<br>
    Held that man degenerated from degenerated apes.</p>
  <p>Bill was British to the backbone, he was loyal through and through;<br>
    Jim declared that Blucher&rsquo;s Prussians won the fight at Waterloo,<br>
    And he hoped the coloured races would in time wipe out the white&mdash;<br>
    And it rather strained their mateship, but it didn&rsquo;t burst it quite.</p>
  <p>They battled round in Maoriland&mdash;they saw it through and through&mdash;<br>
    And argued on the rata, what it was and how it grew;<br>
    Bill believed the vine grew downward, Jim declared that it grew up&mdash;<br>
    Yet they always shared their fortunes to the final bite and sup.</p>
  <p>Night after night they argued how the kangaroo was born,<br>
    And each one held the other&rsquo;s stupid theories in scorn,<br>
    Bill believed it was &lsquo;born inside,&rsquo; Jim declared it was born
    out&mdash;<br>
    Each as to his own opinions never had the slightest doubt.</p>
  <p>They left the earth to argue and they went among the stars,<br>
    Re conditions atmospheric, Bill believed &lsquo;the hair of Mars<br>
  &lsquo;Was too thin for human bein&rsquo;s to exist in mortal states.&rsquo;<br>
    Jim declared it was too thick, if anythin&mdash;yet they were mates</p>
  <p>Bill for Freetrade&mdash;Jim, Protection&mdash;argued as to which was best<br>
    For the welfare of the workers&mdash;and their mateship stood the test!<br>
    They argued over what they meant and didn&rsquo;t mean at all,<br>
    And what they said and didn&rsquo;t&mdash;and were mates in spite of all.</p>
  <p>Till one night&nbsp;<i>the two together</i>&nbsp;tried to light a fire in
    camp,<br>
    When they had a leaky billy and the wood was scarce and damp.<br>
    And . . . No matter: let the moral be distinctly understood:<br>
  <i>One</i>&nbsp;alone should tend the fire, while the other brings the wood.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With stomachs out of order,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The country round that river.</p>
  <p>My mate&mdash;a native of the land&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fiery speech and vulgar,<br>
    Condemned the flies and cursed the sand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And doubly damned the mulga.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bushman he, and clever&mdash;<br>

    The sun was setting (in the west)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In colour like a liver&mdash;<br>
    We&rsquo;d fondly hoped to camp and rest<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night on Paroo River.</p>

  &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to see the Darling now,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;God bless the Grand Old Gutter!&rsquo;<br>
    And now and then he stopped and said<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tones that made me shiver&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;It cannot well be on ahead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>I think we&rsquo;ve crossed the river.</i>&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But soon we saw a strip of ground<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That crossed the track we followed&mdash;<br>
    No barer than the surface round,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just a little hollowed.<br>
    His brows assumed a thoughtful frown&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This speech he did deliver:<br>
  &lsquo;I wonder if we&rsquo;d best go down<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Or up the blessed river?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But where,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;&rsquo;s the blooming stream?&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he replied, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re at it!&rsquo;<br>
    I stood awhile, as in a dream,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Great Scott!&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;is&nbsp;<i>that</i>&nbsp;it?<br>
  &lsquo;Why, that is some old bridle-track!&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He chuckled, &lsquo;Well, I never!<br>
  &lsquo;It&rsquo;s nearly time you came out-back&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;This&nbsp;<i>is</i>&nbsp;the Paroo River!&rsquo;</p>

    Until at last he got a job<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At picking up the wool.<br>
    He found the work was rather rough,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But swore to see it through,<br>
    For he was made of sterling stuff&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Man from Waterloo.</p>
  <p>The first remark was like a stab<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That fell his ear upon,<br>
  &rsquo;Twas&mdash;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s another something scab<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The boss has taken on!&rsquo;<br>
    They couldn&rsquo;t let the towny be&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sneered like anything;<br>
    They&rsquo;d mock him when he&rsquo;d sound the &lsquo;g&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In words that end in &lsquo;ing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>There came a man from Ironbark,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the shed he shore;<br>
    He scoffed his victuals like a shark,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And like a fiend he swore.<br>
    He&rsquo;d shorn his flowing beard that day&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found it hard to reap&mdash;<br>
    Because &rsquo;twas hot and in the way<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he was shearing sheep.<br>
    His loaded fork in grimy holt<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was poised, his jaws moved fast,<br>
    Impatient till his throat could bolt<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouthful taken last.<br>
    He couldn&rsquo;t stand a something toff;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much less a jackaroo;<br>
    And swore to take the trimmings off<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Man from Waterloo.</p>
  <p>The towny saw he must be up<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else be underneath,<br>
    And so one day, before them all,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dared to clean his teeth.<br>
    The men came running from the shed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shouted, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a lark!&rsquo;<br>
  &lsquo;It&rsquo;s gone to clean its tooties!&rsquo; said<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man from Ironbark.<br>
    His feeble joke was much enjoyed;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sneered as bullies do,<br>
    And with a scrubbing-brush he guyed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Man from Waterloo.</p>
  <p>The Jackaroo made no remark<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But peeled and waded in,<br>
    And soon the Man from Ironbark<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had three teeth less to grin!<br>
    And when they knew that he could fight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They swore to see him through,<br>
    Because they saw that he was right&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Man from Waterloo.</p>
  <p>Now in a shop in Sydney, near<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bottle on the Shelf,<br>
    The tale is told&mdash;with trimmings&mdash;by<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jackaroo himself.<br>
  &lsquo;They made my life a hell,&rsquo; he said;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t let me be;<br>
    They set the bully of the shed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;To take it out of me.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The dirt was on him like a sheath,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;He seldom washed his phiz;<br>
  &lsquo;He sneered because I cleaned my teeth&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I guess I dusted his!<br>
  &lsquo;I treated them as they deserved&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I signed on one or two!<br>
  &lsquo;They won&rsquo;t forget me soon,&rsquo; observed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Man from Waterloo.</p>

  <p>Now, I think there is a likeness<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twixt St. Peter&rsquo;s life and mine,<br>
    For he did a lot of trampin&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long ago in Palestine.<br>
    He was &lsquo;union&rsquo; when the workers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First began to organise,<br>
    And&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad that old St. Peter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeps the gate of Paradise.</p>
  <p>When the ancient agitator<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his brothers carried swags,<br>
    I&rsquo;ve no doubt he very often<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tramped with empty tucker-bags;<br>

    And he&rsquo;ll think a union ticket<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as good as Whitely King&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>He denied the Saviour&rsquo;s union,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which was weak of him, no doubt;<br>
    But perhaps his feet was blistered<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his boots had given out.<br>
    And the bitter storm was rushin&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bark and on the slabs,<br>
    And a cheerful fire was blazin&rsquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hut was full of &lsquo;scabs.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * *</b></p>

    They might bother me with offers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a banjo&mdash;meanin&rsquo; well&mdash;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I only want a spell.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;ll just ask for old St. Peter,<br>

    I will only have to tell him<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I carried swag for years.<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been on the track,&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell him,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;An&rsquo; I done the best I could,&rsquo;<br>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheStrangersFriend"></a>The Stranger&rsquo;s Friend</b></h2>
  <p>The strangest&nbsp;things and the maddest things, that a man can do or say,<br>
    To the chaps and fellers and coves Out Back are matters of every day;<br>
    Maybe on account of the lives they lead, or the life that their hearts discard&mdash;<br>
    But never a fool can be too mad or a &lsquo;hard case&rsquo; be too hard.</p>
  <p>I met him in Bourke in the Union days&mdash;with which we have nought to
    do<br>
    (Their creed was narrow, their methods crude, but they stuck to &lsquo;the
    cause&rsquo;  like glue).<br>
    He came into town from the Lost Soul Run for his grim half-yearly &lsquo;bend,&rsquo;<br>
    And because of a curious hobby he had, he was known as &lsquo;The Stranger&rsquo;s
    Friend.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>It is true to the region of adjectives when I say that the spree was &lsquo;grim,&rsquo;<br>
    For to go on the spree was a sacred rite, or a heathen rite, to him,<br>
    To shout for the travellers passing through to the land where the lost soul
    bakes&mdash;<br>
    Till they all seemed devils of different breeds, and his pockets were filled
    with snakes.</p>
  <p>In the joyful mood, in the solemn mood&mdash;in his cynical stages too&mdash;<br>
    In the maudlin stage, in the fighting stage, in the stage when all was blue&mdash;<br>
    From the joyful hour when his spree commenced, right through to the awful
    end,<br>
    He never lost grip of his &lsquo;fixed idee&rsquo; that he was the Stranger&rsquo;s
    Friend.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The feller as knows,&nbsp;<i>he</i>&nbsp;can battle around for his
    bloomin&rsquo; self,&rsquo; he&rsquo;d say&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t give a curse for the &ldquo;blanks&rdquo; I know the hard-up
  bloke this way;<br>
  &lsquo;Send the stranger round, and I&rsquo;ll see him through,&rsquo; and,
  e&rsquo;en as the bushman spoke,<br>
    The chaps and fellers would tip the wink to a casual, &lsquo;hard-up bloke.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And it wasn&rsquo;t only a bushman&rsquo;s &lsquo;bluff&rsquo; to the fame
    of the Friend they scored,<br>
    For he&rsquo;d shout the stranger a suit of clothes, and he&rsquo;d pay for
    the stranger&rsquo;s board&mdash;<br>
    The worst of it was that he&rsquo;d skite all night on the edge of the stranger&rsquo;s
    bunk,<br>
    And never got helplessly drunk himself till he&rsquo;d got the stranger drunk.</p>
  <p>And the chaps and the fellers would speculate&mdash;by way of a ghastly
    joke&mdash;<br>
    As to who&rsquo;d be caught by the &lsquo;jim-jams&rsquo; first&mdash;the
    Friend or the hard-up bloke?<br>
    And the &lsquo;Joker&rsquo; would say that there wasn&rsquo;t a doubt as
    to who&rsquo;d be damned in the end,<br>
    When the Devil got hold of a hard-up bloke in the shape of the Stranger&rsquo;s
    Friend.</p>
  <p>It mattered not to the Stranger&rsquo;s Friend what the rest might say or
    think,<br>
    He always held that the hard-up state was due to the curse of drink,<br>
    To the evils of cards, and of company: &lsquo;But a young cove&rsquo;s built
    that way,<br>
  &lsquo;And I was a bloomin&rsquo; fool meself when I started out,&rsquo; he&rsquo;d
  say.</p>
  <p>At the end of the spree, in clean white &lsquo;moles,&rsquo; clean-shaven,
    and cool as ice,<br>
    He&rsquo;d give the stranger a &lsquo;bob&rsquo; or two, and some straight
    Out Back advice;<br>
    Then he&rsquo;d tramp away for the Lost Soul Run, where the hot dust rose
    like smoke,<br>
    Having done his duty to all mankind, for he&rsquo;d &lsquo;stuck to a hard-up
    bloke.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They&rsquo;ll say &rsquo;tis a &lsquo;song of a sot,&rsquo; perhaps, but
    the Song of a Sot is true.<br>
    I have &lsquo;battled&rsquo; myself, and&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;know, you chaps,
    what a man in the bush goes through:<br>
    Let us hope when the last of his sprees is past, and his cheques and his
    strength are done,<br>
    That, amongst the sober and thrifty mates, the Stranger&rsquo;s Friend has&nbsp;<i>one</i>.</p>

  <p>Pat M&lsquo;Durmer&nbsp;brought the tidings to the town of God-Forgotten
   :<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;There are lively days before ye&mdash;commin
  Parlymint&rsquo;s dissolved!&rsquo;<br>
    And the boys were all excited, for the State, of course, was &lsquo;rotten,&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in subsequent elections, God-Forgotten was involved.<br>
    There was little there to live for save in drinking beer and eating;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we rose on this occasion ere the news appeared
  in print,<br>
    For the boys of God-Forgotten, at a wild, uproarious meeting,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nominated Billy Blazes for the commin Parlymint.</p>
  <p>Other towns had other favourites, but the day before the battle<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bushmen flocked to God-Forgotten, and the distant sheds
  were still;<br>
    Sheep were left to go to glory, and neglected mobs of cattle<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went a-straying down the river at their sweet bucolic
  will.<br>
    William Spouter stood for Freetrade (and his votes were split by Nottin),<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had influence behind him and he also had the tin,<br>
    But across the lonely flatlands came the cry of God-Forgotten,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Vote for Blazes and Protection, and the land
  you&rsquo;re living in!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Pat M&lsquo;Durmer said, &lsquo;Ye schaymers, please to shut yer ugly faces,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Lend yer dirty ears a momint while I give ye
  all a hint:<br>
  &lsquo;<i>Keep ye sober till to-morrow and record yer vote for Blazes</i><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;If ye want to send a ringer to the commin Parlymint.<br>
  &lsquo;As a young and growin&rsquo; township God-Forgotten&rsquo;s been neglected,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And, if we&rsquo;d be ripresinted, now&rsquo;s
  the moment to begin&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Have the local towns encouraged, local industries purtected:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Vote for Blazes, and Protection, and the land
  ye&rsquo;re livin&rsquo; in.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t say that William Blazes is a perfect out-an&rsquo; outer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t say he have the larnin&rsquo;,
  for he never had the luck;<br>
  &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t say he have the logic, or the gift of gab, like Spouter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t say he have the practice&mdash;BUT
  I SAY HE HAVE THE PLUCK!<br>
  &lsquo;Now the country&rsquo;s gone to ruin, and the Governments are rotten,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;But he&rsquo;ll save the public credit and purtect
  the public tin;<br>
  &lsquo;To the iverlastin&rsquo; glory of the name of God-Forgotten<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Vote for Blazes and Protection, and the land
  ye&rsquo;re livin&rsquo; in!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Pat M&lsquo;D. went on the war-path, and he worked like salts and senna,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he organised committees full of energy and push;<br>
    And those wild committees riding through the whisky-fed Gehenna<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Routed out astonished voters from their humpies in
  the bush.<br>
    Everything on wheels was &lsquo;rinted,&rsquo; and half-sobered drunks were
    shot in;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said M&lsquo;Durmer to the driver, &lsquo;If ye want
  to save yer skin,<br>
  &lsquo;Never stop to wet yer whistles&mdash;drive like hell to God-Forgotten,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Make the villains plump for Blazes, and the
  land they&rsquo;re livin, in.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Half the local long-departed (for the purpose resurrected)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plumped for Blazes and Protection, and the country
  where they died;<br>
    So he topped the poll by sixty, and when Blazes was elected<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was victory and triumph on the God-Forgotten
  side.<br>
    Then the boys got up a banquet, and our chairman, Pat M&lsquo;Durmer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was next day discovered sleeping in the local baker&rsquo;s
  bin&mdash;<br>
    All the dough had risen round him, but we heard a smothered murmur,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Vote for Blazes&mdash;and Protection&mdash;and
  the land ye&rsquo;re livin&rsquo; in.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Now the great Sir William Blazes lives in London, &rsquo;cross the waters<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they say his city mansion is the swellest in West
  End,<br>
    But I very often wonder if his torey sons and daughters<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever heard of Billy Blazes who was once the &lsquo;people&rsquo;s
  friend.&rsquo;<br>
    Does his biassed memory linger round that wild electioneering<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the men of God-Forgotten stuck to him through
  thick and thin?<br>
    Does he ever, in his dreaming, hear the cry above the cheering:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Vote for Blazes and Protection, and the land
  you&rsquo;re livin&rsquo; in?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>Ah, the bush was grand in those days, and the Western boys were daisies,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their scheming and their dodging would outdo the
  wildest print;<br>
    Still my recollection lingers round the time when Billy Blazes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was returned by God-Forgotten to the &lsquo;Commin
  Parlymint&rsquo;:<br>
    Still I keep a sign of canvas&mdash;&rsquo;twas a mate of mine that made
    it&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its paint is cracked and powdered, and its threads
  are bare and thin,<br>
    Yet upon its grimy surface you can read in letters faded:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Vote for Blazes and Protection, and the land
  you&rsquo;re livin&rsquo; in.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>The shearers&nbsp;squint along the pens, they squint along the &lsquo;shoots;&rsquo;<br>
    The shearers squint along the board to catch the Boss&rsquo;s boots;<br>
    They have no time to straighten up, they have no time to stare,<br>
    But when the Boss is looking on, they like to be aware.</p>
  <p><i>The &lsquo;rouser&rsquo; has no soul to save. Condemn the rouseabout!<br>
    And sling &rsquo;em in, and rip &rsquo;em through, and get the bell-sheep

    But &lsquo;pink&rsquo; &rsquo;em nice and pretty when you see the Boss&rsquo;s
    boots.</i> </p>
  <p>The shearing super sprained his foot, as bosses sometimes do&mdash;<br>
    And wore, until the shed cut out, one &lsquo;side-spring&rsquo; and one shoe;<br>
    And though he changed his pants at times&mdash;some worn-out and some neat&mdash;<br>
    No &lsquo;tiger&rsquo; there could possibly mistake the Boss&rsquo;s feet.</p>
  <p>The Boss affected larger boots than many Western men,<br>
    And Jim the Ringer swore the shoe was half as big again;<br>
    And tigers might have&nbsp;<i>heard</i>&nbsp;the boss ere any harm was done&mdash;<br>
    For when he passed it was a sort of dot and carry one.</p>
  <p>But now there comes a picker-up who sprained his ankle, too,<br>
    And limping round the shed he found the Boss&rsquo;s cast-off shoe.<br>
    He went to work, all legs and arms, as green-hand rousers will,<br>
    And never dreamed of Boss&rsquo;s boots&mdash;much less of Bogan Bill.</p>
  <p><i>Ye sons of sin that tramp and shear in hot and dusty scrubs,<br>
    Just keep away from &lsquo;headin&rsquo; &rsquo;em,&rsquo; and keep away
    from pubs,<br>
    And keep away from handicaps&mdash;for so your sugar scoots&mdash;<br>
    And you may own a station yet and wear the Boss&rsquo;s boots.</i> </p>
  <p>And Bogan by his mate was heard to mutter through his hair:<br>
  &lsquo;The Boss has got a rat to-day: he&rsquo;s buckin&rsquo; everywhere&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;He&rsquo;s trainin&rsquo; for a bike, I think, the way he comes an&rsquo; scoots,<br>
  &lsquo;He&rsquo;s like a bloomin&rsquo; cat on mud the way he shifts his boots.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Now Bogan Bill was shearing rough and chanced to cut a teat;<br>
    He stuck his leg in front at once, and slewed the ewe a bit;<br>
    He hurried up to get her through, when, close beside his shoot,<br>
    He saw a large and ancient shoe, in mateship with a boot.</p>
  <p>He thought that he&rsquo;d be fined all right&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t turn
    the  &lsquo;yoe;&rsquo;<br>
    The more he wished the boss away, the more he wouldn&rsquo;t go;<br>
    And Bogan swore amenfully&mdash;beneath his breath he swore&mdash;<br>
    And he was never known to &lsquo;pink&rsquo; so prettily before.</p>
  <p>And Bogan through his bristling scalp in his mind&rsquo;s eye could trace,<br>
    The cold, sarcastic smile that lurked about the Boss&rsquo;s face;<br>
    He cursed him with a silent curse in language known to few,<br>
    He cursed him from his boot right up, and then down to his shoe.</p>
  <p>But while he shore so mighty clean, and while he screened the teat,<br>
    He fancied there was something wrong about the Boss&rsquo;s feet:<br>
    The boot grew unfamiliar, and the odd shoe seemed awry,<br>
    And slowly up the trouser went the tail of Bogan&rsquo;s eye,</p>
  <p>Then swiftly to the features from a plaited green-hide belt&mdash;<br>
    You&rsquo;d have to ring a shed or two to feel as Bogan felt&mdash;<br>
    For &rsquo;twas his green-hand picker-up (who wore a vacant look),<br>
    And Bogan saw the Boss outside consulting with his cook.</p>
  <p>And Bogan Bill was hurt and mad to see that rouseabout<br>
    And Bogan laid his &lsquo;Wolseley&rsquo; down and knocked that rouser out;<br>
    He knocked him right across the board, he tumbled through the shoot&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll learn the fool,&rsquo; said Bogan Bill, &lsquo;to flash the
  Boss&rsquo;s boot!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The rouser squints along the pens, he squints along the shoots,<br>
    And gives his men the office when they miss the Boss&rsquo;s boots.<br>
    They have no time to straighten up, they&rsquo;re too well-bred to stare,<br>
    But when the Boss is looking on they like to be aware.</p>

  <p>As the&nbsp;night was falling slowly down on city, town and bush,<br>
    From a slum in Jones&rsquo;s Alley sloped the Captain of the Push;<br>
    And he scowled towards the North, and he scowled towards the South,<br>
    As he hooked his little finger in the corners of his mouth.<br>
    Then his whistle, loud and shrill, woke the echoes of the &lsquo;Rocks&rsquo;,<br>
    And a dozen ghouls came sloping round the corners of the blocks.</p>
  <p>There was nought to rouse their anger; yet the oath that each one swore<br>
    Seemed less fit for publication than the one that went before.<br>
    For they spoke the gutter language with the easy flow that comes<br>
    Only to the men whose childhood knew the brothels and the slums.<br>
    Then they spat in turns, and halted; and the one that came behind,<br>
    Spitting fiercely on the pavement, called on Heaven to strike him blind.</p>
  <p>Let us first describe the captain, bottle-shouldered, pale and thin,<br>
    For he was the beau-ideal of a Sydney larrikin;<br>
    E&rsquo;en his hat was most suggestive of the city where we live,<br>
    With a gallows-tilt that no one, save a larrikin, can give;<br>
    And the coat, a little shorter than the writer would desire,<br>
    Showed a more or less uncertain portion of his strange attire.</p>
  <p>That which tailors know as &lsquo;trousers&rsquo;&mdash;known by him as &lsquo;bloomin&rsquo;  bags&rsquo;&mdash;<br>
    Hanging loosely from his person, swept, with tattered ends, the flags;<br>
    And he had a pointed sternpost to the boots that peeped below<br>
    (Which he laced up from the centre of the nail of his great toe),<br>
    And he wore his shirt uncollar&rsquo;d, and the tie correctly wrong;<br>
    But I think his vest was shorter than should be in one so long.</p>
  <p>And the captain crooked his finger at a stranger on the kerb,<br>
    Whom he qualified politely with an adjective and verb,<br>
    And he begged the Gory Bleeders that they wouldn&rsquo;t interrupt<br>
    Till he gave an introduction&mdash;it was painfully abrupt&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the bleedin&rsquo; push, me covey&mdash;here&rsquo;s a
  (something) from the bush!<br>
    Strike me dead, he wants to join us!&rsquo; said the captain of the push.</p>
  <p>Said the stranger: &lsquo;I am nothing but a bushy and a dunce;<br>
  &lsquo;But I read about the Bleeders in the&nbsp;<i>Weekly Gasbag</i>&nbsp;once;<br>
  &lsquo;Sitting lonely in the humpy when the wind began to &ldquo;whoosh,&rdquo;<br>
  &lsquo;How I longed to share the dangers and the pleasures of the push!<br>
  &lsquo;Gosh! I hate the swells and good &rsquo;uns&mdash;I could burn &rsquo;em
  in their beds;<br>
  &lsquo;I am with you, if you&rsquo;ll have me, and I&rsquo;ll break their blazing
  heads.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Now, look here,&rsquo; exclaimed the captain to the stranger from
    the bush,<br>
  &lsquo;Now, look here&mdash;suppose a feller was to split upon the push,<br>
  &lsquo;Would you lay for him and fetch him, even if the traps were round?<br>
  &lsquo;Would you lay him out and kick him to a jelly on the ground?<br>
  &lsquo;Would you jump upon the nameless&mdash;kill, or cripple him, or both?<br>
  &lsquo;Speak? or else I&rsquo;ll&nbsp;<i>speak</i>!&rsquo; The stranger answered, &lsquo;My
  kerlonial oath!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Now, look here,&rsquo; exclaimed the captain to the stranger from
    the bush,<br>
  &lsquo;Now, look here&mdash;suppose the Bleeders let you come and join the
  push,<br>
  &lsquo;Would you smash a bleedin&rsquo; bobby if you got the blank alone?<br>
  &lsquo;Would you break a swell or Chinkie&mdash;split his garret with a stone?<br>
  &lsquo;Would you have a &ldquo;moll&rdquo; to keep yer&mdash;like to swear
  off work for good?&rsquo;<br>
  &lsquo;Yes, my oath!&rsquo; replied the stranger. &lsquo;My kerlonial oath!
  I would!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Now, look here,&rsquo; exclaimed the captain to the stranger from
    the bush,<br>
  &lsquo;Now, look here&mdash;before the Bleeders let yer come and join the push,<br>
  &lsquo;You must prove that you&rsquo;re a blazer&mdash;you must prove that
  you have grit<br>
  &lsquo;Worthy of a Gory Bleeder&mdash;you must show your form a bit&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Take a rock and smash that winder!&rsquo; and the stranger, nothing
  loth,<br>
    Took the rock&mdash;and smash! They only muttered, &lsquo;My kerlonial oath!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>So they swore him in, and found him sure of aim and light of heel,<br>
    And his only fault, if any, lay in his excessive zeal;<br>
    He was good at throwing metal, but we chronicle with pain<br>
    That he jumped upon a victim, damaging the watch and chain,<br>
    Ere the Bleeders had secured them; yet the captain of the push<br>
    Swore a dozen oaths in favour of the stranger from the bush.</p>
  <p>Late next morn the captain, rising, hoarse and thirsty from his lair,<br>
    Called the newly-feather&rsquo;d Bleeder, but the stranger wasn&rsquo;t there!<br>
    Quickly going through the pockets of his &lsquo;bloomin&rsquo; bags,&rsquo; he
    learned<br>
    That the stranger had been through him for the stuff his &lsquo;moll&rsquo; had
    earned;<br>
    And the language that he muttered I should scarcely like to tell.<br>
    (Stars! and notes of exclamation!! blank and dash will do as well).</p>
  <p>In the night the captain&rsquo;s signal woke the echoes of the &lsquo;Rocks,&rsquo;<br>
    Brought the Gory Bleeders sloping thro&rsquo; the shadows of the blocks;<br>
    And they swore the stranger&rsquo;s action was a blood-escaping shame,<br>
    While they waited for the nameless, but the nameless never came.<br>
    And the Bleeders soon forgot him; but the captain of the push<br>
    Still is &lsquo;laying&rsquo; round, in ballast, for the nameless &lsquo;from
    the bush.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BillysSquareAffair"></a>Billy&rsquo;s  &lsquo;Square Affair&rsquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Long Bill, the captain of the push, was tired of his estate,<br>
    And wished to change his life and win the love of something &lsquo;straight&rsquo;;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas rumour&rsquo;d that the Gory B.&rsquo;s had heard Long Bill declare<br>
    That he would turn respectable and wed a &lsquo;square affair.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He craved the kiss of innocence; his spirit longed to rise;<br>
    The &lsquo;Crimson Streak,&rsquo; his faithful &lsquo;piece,&rsquo; grew
    hateful in his eyes;<br>
    (And though, in her entirety, the Crimson Streak &lsquo;was there,&rsquo;<br>
    I grieve to state the Crimson Streak was not a &lsquo;square affair.&rsquo;)</p>
  <p>He wanted clothes, a masher suit, he wanted boots and hat;<br>
    His girl had earned a quid or two&mdash;he wouldn&rsquo;t part with that;<br>
    And so he went to Brickfield Hill, and from a draper there<br>
    He &lsquo;shook&rsquo; the proper kind of togs to fetch a &lsquo;square affair.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Long Bill went to the barber&rsquo;s shop and had a shave and singe,<br>
    And from his narrow forehead combed his darling Mabel fringe;<br>
    Long Bill put on a &lsquo;square cut&rsquo; and he brushed his boots with
    care,<br>
    And roved about the Gardens till he mashed a &lsquo;square affair.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She was a tony servant-girl from somewhere on &lsquo;the Shore;&rsquo;<br>
    She dressed in style that suited Bill&mdash;he could not wish for more.<br>
    While in her guileless presence he had ceased to chew or swear,<br>
    He knew the kind of barrack that can fetch a square affair.</p>
  <p>To thus desert his donah old was risky and a sin,<br>
    And &rsquo;twould have served him right if she had caved his garret in.<br>
    The Gory Bleeders thought it too, and warned him to take care<br>
    In case the Crimson Streak got scent of Billy&rsquo;s square affair.</p>
  <p>He took her to the stalls; &rsquo;twas dear, but Billy said &lsquo;Wot odds!&rsquo;<br>
    He couldn&rsquo;t take his square affair amongst the crimson gods.<br>
    They wandered in the park at night, and hugged each other there&mdash;<br>
    But, ah! the Crimson Streak got wind of Billy&rsquo;s square affair!</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The blank and space and stars!&rsquo; she yelled; &lsquo;the nameless
    crimson dash!<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll smash the blanky crimson and his square affair, I&rsquo;ll
  smash&rsquo;&mdash;<br>
    In short, she drank and raved and shrieked and tore her crimson hair,<br>
    And swore to murder Billy and to pound his square affair.</p>
  <p>And so one summer evening, as the day was growing dim,<br>
    She watched her bloke go out, and foxed his square affair and him.<br>
    That night the park was startled by the shrieks that rent the air&mdash;<br>
    The &lsquo;Streak&rsquo; had gone for Billy and for Billy&rsquo;s square
    affair.</p>
  <p>The &lsquo;gory&rsquo; push had foxed the Streak, they foxed her to the
    park,<br>
    And they, of course; were close at hand to see the bleedin&rsquo; lark;<br>
    A cop arrived in time to hear a &lsquo;gory B.&rsquo; declare<br>
  &lsquo;Gor blar-me! here&rsquo;s the Red Streak foul of Billy&rsquo;s square
  affair.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
  <p>Now Billy scowls about the Rocks, his manly beauty marr&rsquo;d,<br>
    And Billy&rsquo;s girl, upon her &rsquo;ed, is doin&rsquo; six months &rsquo;ard;<br>
    Bill&rsquo;s swivel eye is in a sling, his heart is in despair,<br>
    And in the Sydney &rsquo;Orspital lies Billy&rsquo;s square affair.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ADerryonaCove"></a>A Derry on a Cove</b></h2>
  <p><b>&rsquo;</b>Twas&nbsp;in the felon&rsquo;s dock he stood, his eyes were
    black and blue;<br>
    His voice with grief was broken, and his nose was broken, too;<br>
    He muttered, as that broken nose he wiped upon his cap&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;It&rsquo;s orfal when the p&rsquo;leece has got a derry on a chap.</p>

  &lsquo;Oh, yes, the legal gents can grin, I say it ain&rsquo;t no joke&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;It&rsquo;s cruel when the p&rsquo;leece has got a derry on a bloke.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to work?&rsquo; he said (he muttered, &lsquo;Why
    don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;).<br>
  &lsquo;Yer honer knows as well as me there ain&rsquo;t no work to do.<br>
  &lsquo;And when I try to find a job I&rsquo;m shaddered by a trap&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;It&rsquo;s awful when the p&rsquo;leece has got a derry on a chap.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I sigh&rsquo;d and shed a tearlet for that noble nature marred,<br>
    But, ah! the Bench was rough on him, and gave him six months&rsquo; hard.<br>
    He only said, &lsquo;Beyond the grave you&rsquo;ll cop it hot, by Jove!<br>

  <p>Ye&nbsp;children of the Land of Gold,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sing a song to you,<br>
    And if the jokes are somewhat old,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main idea is new.<br>
    So be it sung, by hut and tent,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where tall the native grows;<br>
    And understand, the song is meant<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For singing through the nose.</p>
  <p>There dwelt a hard old cockatoo<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On western hills far out,<br>
    Where everything is green and blue,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except, of course, in drought;<br>
    A crimson Anarchist was he&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held other men in scorn&mdash;<br>
    Yet preached that ev&rsquo;ry man was free,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And also &lsquo;ekal born.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He lived in his ancestral hut&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His missus wasn&rsquo;t there&mdash;<br>
    And there was no one with him but<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His daughter, Mabel Clare.<br>
    Her eyes and hair were like the sun;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her foot was like a mat;<br>
    Her cheeks a trifle overdone;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a democrat.</p>
  <p>A manly independence, born<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the trees, she had,<br>
    She treated womankind with scorn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And often cursed her dad.<br>
    She hated swells and shining lights,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For she had seen a few,<br>
    And she believed in &lsquo;women&rsquo;s rights&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(She mostly got&rsquo;em, too).</p>
  <p>A stranger at the neighb&rsquo;ring run<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sojourned, the squatter&rsquo;s guest,<br>
    He was unknown to anyone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But like a swell was dress&rsquo;d;<br>
    He had an eyeglass to his eye,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A collar to his ears,<br>
    His feet were made to tread the sky,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mouth was formed for sneers.</p>
  <p>He wore the latest toggery,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loudest thing in ties&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas generally reckoned he<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was something in disguise.<br>
    But who he was, or whence he came,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was long unknown, except<br>
    Unto the squatter, who the name<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And noble secret kept.</p>
  <p>And strolling in the noontide heat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the blinding glare,<br>
    This noble stranger chanced to meet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radiant Mabel Clare.<br>
    She saw at once he was a swell&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to her lights&mdash;<br>
    But, ah! &rsquo;tis very sad to tell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She met him oft of nights.</p>
  <p>And, strolling through a moonlit gorge,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She chatted all the while<br>
    Of Ingersoll, and Henry George,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Bradlaugh and Carlyle:<br>
    In short, he learned to love the girl,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And things went on like this,<br>
    Until he said he was an Earl,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And asked her to be his.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, say no more, Lord Kawlinee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Oh, say no more!&rsquo; she said;<br>
  &lsquo;Oh, say no more, Lord Kawlinee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I wish that I was dead:<br>
  &lsquo;My head is in a hawful whirl,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The truth I dare not tell&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;I am a democratic girl,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And cannot wed a swell!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh love!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;but you forget<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;That you are most unjust;<br>
  &lsquo;&rsquo;Twas not my fault that I was set<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Within the upper crust.<br>
  &lsquo;Heed not the yarns the poets tell&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Oh, darling, do not doubt<br>
  &lsquo;A simple lord can love as well<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;As any rouseabout!</p>
  <p>&lsquo;For you I&rsquo;ll give my fortune up&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I&rsquo;d go to work for you!<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll put the money in the cup<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And drop the title, too.<br>
  &lsquo;Oh, fly with me! Oh, fly with me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Across the mountains blue!<br>
  &lsquo;Hoh, fly with me!&nbsp;<i>Hoh, fly with me!</i>&mdash;&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That very night she flew.</p>
  <p>They took the train and journeyed down&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the range they sped&mdash;<br>
    Until they came to Sydney town,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where shortly they were wed.<br>
    And still upon the western wild<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admiring teamsters tell<br>
    How Mabel&rsquo;s father cursed his child<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For clearing with a swell.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What ails my bird this bridal night,&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exclaimed Lord Kawlinee;<br>
  &lsquo;What ails my own this bridal night&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;O love, confide in me!&rsquo;<br>
  &lsquo;Oh now,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that I am yaws<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll let me weep&mdash;I must&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;I did desert the people&rsquo;s cause<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;To join the upper crust.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>O proudly smiled his lordship then&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His chimney-pot he floor&rsquo;d&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Look up, my love, and smile again,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;For I am not a lord!&rsquo;<br>
    His eye-glass from his eye he tore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dickey from his breast,<br>
    And turned and stood his bride before<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rouseabout&mdash;confess&rsquo;d!</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Unknown I&rsquo;ve loved you long,&rsquo; he said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And I have loved you true&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;A-shearing in your guv&rsquo;ner&rsquo;s shed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I learned to worship you.<br>
  &lsquo;I do not care for place or pelf,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;For now, my love, I&rsquo;m sure<br>
  &lsquo;That you will love me for myself<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And not because I&rsquo;m poor.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To prove your love I spent my cheque<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;To buy this swell rig-out;<br>
  &lsquo;So fling your arms about my neck<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;For I&rsquo;m a rouseabout!&rsquo;<br>
    At first she gave a startled cry,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, safe from care&rsquo;s alarms,<br>
    She sigh&rsquo;d a soul-subduing sigh<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sank into his arms.</p>
  <p>He pawned the togs, and home he took<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His bride in all her charms;<br>
    The proud old cockatoo received<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pair with open arms.<br>
    And long they lived, the faithful bride,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noble rouseabout&mdash;<br>
    And if she wasn&rsquo;t satisfied<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She never let it out.</p>

  <p>Most&nbsp;unpleasantly adjacent to the haunts of lower orders<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood a &lsquo;terrace&rsquo; in the city when the
  current year began,<br>
    And a notice indicated there were vacancies for boarders<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle house, and lodgings for a single gentleman.<br>
    Now, a singular observer could have seen but few attractions<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether in the house, or &lsquo;missus&rsquo;, or the
  notice, or the street,<br>
    But at last there came a lodger whose appearances and actions<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puzzled Constable M&lsquo;Carty, the policeman on the
  beat.</p>
  <p>He (the single gent) was wasted almost to emaciation,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his features were the palest that M&lsquo;Carty
  ever saw,<br>
    And these indications, pointing to a past of dissipation,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greatly strengthened the suspicions of the agent of
  the law.<br>
    He (the lodger&mdash;hang the pronoun!) seemed to like the stormy weather,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the elements in battle kept it up a little late;<br>
    Yet he&rsquo;d wander in the moonlight when the stars were close together,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking ghostly consolation in a visionary state.</p>
  <p>He would walk the streets at midnight, when the storm-king raised his banner,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk without his old umbrella,&mdash;wave his arms
  above his head:<br>
    Or he&rsquo;d fold them tight, and mutter, in a wild, disjointed manner,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the town was wrapped in slumber and he should
  have been in bed.<br>
    Said the constable-on-duty: &lsquo;Shure, Oi wonther phwat his trade is?&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the constable would watch him from the shadow of
  a wall,<br>
    But he never picked a pocket, and he ne&rsquo;er accosted ladies,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the constable was puzzled what to make of him at
  all.</p>
  <p>Now, M&lsquo;Carty had arrested more than one notorious dodger,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had heard of men afflicted with the strangest kind
  of fads,<br>
    But he couldn&rsquo;t fix the station or the business of the lodger,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who at times would chum with cadgers, and at other
  times with cads.<br>
    And the constable would often stand and wonder how the gory<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheol the stranger got his living, for he loafed the
  time away<br>
    And he often sought a hillock when the sun went down in glory,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as if he was a mourner at the burial of the day.</p>
  <p>Mac. had noticed that the lodger did a mighty lot of smoking,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And could &lsquo;stow away a long &rsquo;un,&rsquo; never
  winking, so he could;<br>
    And M&lsquo;Carty once, at midnight, came upon the lodger poking<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round about suspicious alleys where the common houses
  stood.<br>
    Yet the constable had seen him in a class above suspicion&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen him welcomed with effusion by a dozen &lsquo;toney
  gents&rsquo;&mdash;<br>
    Seen him driving in the buggy of a rising politician<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thro&rsquo; the gateway of the member&rsquo;s toney
  private residence.</p>
  <p>And the constable, off duty, had observed the lodger slipping<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down a lane to where the river opened on the ocean
  wide,<br>
    Where he&rsquo;d stand for hours gazing at the distant anchor&rsquo;d shipping,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he never took his coat off, so it wasn&rsquo;t
  suicide.<br>
    For the constable had noticed that a man who&rsquo;s filled with loathing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his selfish fellow-creatures and the evil things
  that be,<br>
    Will, for some mysterious reason, shed a portion of his clothing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere he takes his first and final plunge into eternity.</p>
  <p>And M&lsquo;Carty, once at midnight&mdash;be it said to his abasement&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left his beat and climbed a railing of considerable
  height,<br>
    Just to watch the lodger&rsquo;s shadow on the curtain of his casement<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the little room was lighted in the listening
  hours of night.<br>
    Now, at first the shadow hinted that the substance sat inditing;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it indicated toothache, or the headache; and again,<br>
  &rsquo;Twould exaggerate the gestures of a dipsomaniac fighting<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those original conceptions of a whisky-sodden brain.</p>
  <p>Then the constable, retreating, scratched his head and muttered  &lsquo;Sorra<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Wan of me can undershtand it. But Oi&rsquo;ll
  keep me oi on him,<br>
  &lsquo;Divil take him and his tantrums; he&rsquo;s a lunatic, begorra!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Or, if he was up to mischief, he&rsquo;d be
  sure to douse the glim.&rsquo;<br>
    But M&lsquo;Carty wasn&rsquo;t easy, for he had a vague suspicion<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a &lsquo;skame&rsquo; was being plotted; and he
  thought the matter down<br>
    Till his mind was pretty certain that the business was sedition,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the man, in league with others, sought to overthrow
  the Crown.</p>
  <p>But, in spite of observation, Mac received no information<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was forced to stay inactive, being puzzled for
  a charge.<br>
    That the lodger was a madman seemed the only explanation,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho&rsquo; the house would scarcely harbour such a
  lunatic at large.<br>
    His appearance failed to warrant apprehension as a vagrant,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho&rsquo; &rsquo;twas getting very shabby, as the
  constable could see;<br>
    But M&lsquo;Carty in the meantime hoped to catch him in a flagrant<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breach of peace, or the intention to commit a felony.</p>
  <p>(For digression there is leisure, and it is the writer&rsquo;s pleasure<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to pause a while and ponder on a painful legal
  fact,<br>
    Being forced to say in sorrow, and a line of doubtful measure,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That there&rsquo;s nothing so elastic as the cruel
  Vagrant Act)<br>
    Now, M&lsquo;Carty knew his duty, and was brave as any lion,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he dreaded being &lsquo;landed&rsquo; in an influential
  bog&mdash;<br>
    As the chances were he would be if the man he had his eye on<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a person of importance who was travelling&nbsp;<i>incog.</i></p>
  <p>Want of sleep and over-worry seemed to tell upon M&lsquo;Carty:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was thirsty more than ever, but his appetite resigned;<br>
    He was previously reckoned as a jolly chap and hearty,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the mystery was lying like a mountain on his mind.<br>
    Tho&rsquo; he tried his best, he couldn&rsquo;t get a hold upon the lodger,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the latter&rsquo;s antecedents weren&rsquo;t known
  to the police&mdash;<br>
    They considered that the &lsquo;devil&rsquo; was a dark and artful dodger<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was scheming under cover for the downfall of the
  peace.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas a simple explanation, though M&lsquo;Carty didn&rsquo;t know
    it,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which with half his penetration he might easily have
  seen,<br>
  <i>For the object of his dangerous suspicions was a poet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was not so widely famous as he thought he should
  have been.</i><br>
    And the constable grew thinner, till one morning, &lsquo;little dhramin&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Av the sword of revelation that was leapin&rsquo; from
  its sheath,&rsquo;<br>
    He alighted on some verses in the columns of the&nbsp;<i>Frayman</i>,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;<i>Wid the christian name an&rsquo; surname
  av the lodger onderneath!</i>&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Now, M&lsquo;Carty and the poet are as brother is to brother,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, at least, as brothers should be; and they very
  often meet<br>
    On the lonely block at midnight, and they wink at one another&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disappearing down the by-way of a shanty in the street.<br>
    And the poet&rsquo;s name you&rsquo;re asking!&mdash;well, the ground is
    very tender,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must wait until the public put the gilt upon the
  name,<br>
    Till a glorious, sorrow-drowning, and, perhaps, a final &lsquo;bender,&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heralds his triumphant entrance to the thunder-halls
  of Fame.</p>

    Stepped proudly on the platform as the ringer on my side;<br>
    Old dad was in his glory there&mdash;it gave the old man joy<br>
    To fight a passage through the crowd and barrack for his boy.</p>
  <p>A friend came up and said to me, &lsquo;Put out your muscles, John,<br>
    And pull them to eternity&mdash;your guvnor&rsquo;s looking on.&rsquo;<br>
    I paused before I grasped the rope, and glanced around the place,<br>

  <p>My mates were strong and plucky chaps, but very soon I knew<br>
    That our opponents had the weight and strength to pull them through;<br>
    The boys were losing surely and defeat was very near,<br>
    When, high above the mighty roar, I heard the old man cheer!</p>
  <p>I felt my muscles swelling when the old man cheer&rsquo;d for me,<br>
    I felt as though I&rsquo;d burst my heart, or gain the victory!<br>
    I shouted, &lsquo;Now! Together!&rsquo; and a steady strain replied,<br>
    And, with a mighty heave, I helped to beat the other side!</p>
  <p>Oh! how the old man shouted in his wild, excited joy!<br>
    I thought he&rsquo;d burst his boiler then, a-cheering for his boy;<br>
    The chaps, oh! how they cheered me, while the girls all smiled so kind,<br>

    Brainy, yet without the courage to forsake the beaten track&mdash;<br>
    Cautiously they feel their way behind a bolder spirit&rsquo;s back.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waist-high along the siding,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three boys on bare-back riding;<br>
    Beneath the sheoaks in the bend<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waterhole was brimming&mdash;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The times we &lsquo;went in swimming?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The days we &lsquo;played the wag&rsquo; from school&mdash;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And naked boys are kingly!<br>
    With mud for soap the sun to dry&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A well planned lie to stay us,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though scarcely for his bounty&mdash;<br>
    He leased a forty-acre block,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thought he owned the county;<br>
    A farmer of the old world school,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That men grew hard and grim in,<br>
    He drew his water from the pool<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we preferred to swim in.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, resting there and chumming,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw the farmer coming!<br>
    And home impressions linger yet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of cups of sorrow brimming;<br>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheOldBarkSchool"></a>The Old Bark School</b></h2>
  <p>It was&nbsp;built of bark and poles, and the floor was full of holes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where each leak in rainy weather made a pool;<br>
    And the walls were mostly cracks lined with calico and sacks&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was little need for windows in the school.</p>
  <p>Then we rode to school and back by the rugged gully track,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the old grey horse that carried three or four;<br>
    And he looked so very wise that he lit the master&rsquo;s eyes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time he put his head in at the door.</p>
  <p>He had run with Cobb and Co.&mdash;&lsquo;that grey leader, let him go!&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were men &lsquo;as knowed the brand upon his
  hide,&rsquo;<br>
    And &lsquo;as knowed it on the course&rsquo;. Funeral service: &lsquo;Good
    old horse!&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we burnt him in the gully where he died.</p>
  <p>And the master thought the same. &rsquo;Twas from Ireland that he came,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the tanks are full all summer, and the feed is
  simply grand;<br>
    And the joker then in vogue said his lessons wid a brogue&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twas unconscious imitation, let the reader understand.</p>
  <p>And we learnt the world in scraps from some ancient dingy maps<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long discarded by the public-schools in town;<br>
    And as nearly every book dated back to Captain Cook<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our geography was somewhat upside-down.</p>
  <p>It was &lsquo;in the book&rsquo; and so&mdash;well, at that we&rsquo;d let
    it go,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we never would believe that print could lie;<br>
    And we all learnt pretty soon that when we came out at noon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The sun is in the south part of the sky.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And Ireland!&nbsp;<i>that</i>&nbsp;was known from the coast line to Athlone:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We got little information&nbsp;<i>re</i>&nbsp;the land
  that gave us birth;<br>
    Save that Captain Cook was killed (and was very likely grilled)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And &lsquo;the natives of New Holland are the lowest
  race on earth.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And a woodcut, in its place, of the same degraded race<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed a lot more like a camel than the black-fellows

    Jimmy Bullock, with the rest, scratched his head and gave it best;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his faith was sadly shaken by a bobtailed kangaroo.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, about the time they built it, our old master was  &lsquo;transferred.&rsquo;</p>

    Where the dead men lie and the black men lie,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bushman lies for ever.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas the custom still with the local blacks<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cadge in the &lsquo;altogether&rsquo;&mdash;<br>
    They had less respect for our feelings then,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And more respect for the weather.</p>
  <p>The trooper said to the sergeant&rsquo;s wife:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Sure, I wouldn&rsquo;t seem unpleasant;<br>
  &lsquo;But there&rsquo;s women and childer about the place,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And&mdash;barrin&rsquo; a lady&rsquo;s present&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s ould King Billy wid niver a stitch<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;For a month&mdash;may the drought cremate him!&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Bar the wan we put in his dhirty head,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Where his old Queen Mary bate him.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;God give her strength!&mdash;and a peaceful reign&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Though she flies in a bit av a passion<br>
  &lsquo;If ony wan hints that her shtoyle an&rsquo; luks<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Are a trifle behind the fashion.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s two of the boys by the stable now&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Be the powers! I&rsquo;ll teach the varmints<br>
  &lsquo;To come wid nought but a shirt apiece,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And wid dirt for their nayther garmints.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Howld on, ye blaggards! How dare ye dare<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;To come widin sight av the houses?&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give ye a warnin&rsquo; all for wance<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;An&rsquo; a couple of ould pair of trousers.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They took the pants as a child a toy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constable&rsquo;s words beguiling<br>
    A smile of something beside their joy;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they took their departure smiling.</p>
  <p>And that very day, when the sun was low,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two blackfellows came to the station;<br>
    They were filled with the courage of Queensland rum<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bursting with indignation.</p>
  <p>The constable noticed, with growing ire,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;d apparently dressed in a hurry;<br>
    And their language that day, I am sorry to say,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mostly consisted of &lsquo;plurry.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The constable heard, and he wished himself back<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the land of the bogs and the ditches&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;You plurry big tight-britches p&rsquo;liceman, what for<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;You gibbit our missuses britches?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And this was a case, I am bound to confess,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where civilisation went under;<br>
    Had one of the gins been&nbsp;<i>less</i>&nbsp;modest in dress<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;d never have made such a blunder.</p>
  <p>And here let the moral be duly made known,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hereafter signed and attested:<br>
    We should place more reliance on that which is shown<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And less upon what is suggested.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AStudyintheNood"></a>A Study in the &ldquo;Nood&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;A sailor &nbsp;named Grice was seen by the guard of a goods train
    lying close to the railway-line near Warner Town (S.A.) in a nude condition.
    He was unconscious, and had lain there three days, during one of which the
    glass registed 110 in the shade. Grice expressed surprise that the train
  did not pick him up.&rsquo;&mdash;Daily paper. In consequence, the muse:&mdash;</p>
  <p>He&nbsp;was bare&mdash;we don&rsquo;t want to be rude&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(His condition was owing to drink)<br>
    They say his condition was nood,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which amounts to the same thing, we think<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(We mean his&nbsp;<i>condition</i>, we think,<br>
  &rsquo;Twas a naked condition, or&nbsp;<i>nood</i>,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which amounts to the same thing, we think)</p>
  <p>Uncovered he lay on the grass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shrivelled and shrunk; and he stayed<br>
    Three hot summer days, while the glass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was one hundred and ten in the shade.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(We nearly remarked that he&nbsp;<i>laid</i>,<br>
    But that was bad grammar we thought&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;<i>does</i>&nbsp;sound bucolic, we think<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It smacks of the barnyard&mdash;<br>
    Of farming&mdash;of&nbsp;<i>pullets</i>&nbsp;in short.)</p>
  <p>Unheeded he lay on the dirt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him a part of his dress,<br>
    A tattered and threadbare old shirt<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was raised as a flag of distress.<br>
    (On a stick, like a flag of distress&mdash;<br>
    Reversed&mdash;we mean that the tail-end was up<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>half-mast</i>&mdash;on a stick&mdash;an evident
  flag of distress.)</p>
  <p>Perhaps in his dreams he persood<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright visions of heav&rsquo;nly bliss;<br>
    And artists who study the nood<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never saw such a study as this.<br>
    The &lsquo;luggage&rsquo; went by and the guard<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked out and his eyes fell on Grice&mdash;<br>
    We fancy he looked at him hard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think that he looked at him twice.</p>
  <p>They say (if the telegram&rsquo;s true)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he woke up he wondered (good Lord!)<br>
  &lsquo;Why the engine-man didn&rsquo;t heave to&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Why the train didn&rsquo;t take him aboard.&rsquo;<br>
    And now, by the case of poor Grice,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think that a daily express<br>
    Should travel with sunshades and ice,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a lookout for flags of distress.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AWordtoTexasJack"></a>A Word to Texas Jack</b></h2>
  <p>Texas Jack, you are amusin&rsquo;. By Lord Harry, how I laughed<br>
    When I seen yer rig and saddle with its bulwarks fore-and-aft;<br>
    Holy smoke! In such a saddle how the dickens can yer fall?<br>
    Why, I seen a gal ride bareback with no bridle on at all!<br>
    Gosh! so-help-me! strike-me-balmy! if a bit o&rsquo; scenery<br>
    Like ter you in all yer rig-out on the earth I ever see!<br>
    How I&rsquo;d like ter see a bushman use yer fixins, Texas Jack;<br>
    On the remnant of a saddle he can ride to hell and back.<br>
    Why, I heerd a mother screamin&rsquo; when her kid went tossin&rsquo; by<br>
    Ridin&rsquo; bareback on a bucker that had murder in his eye.</p>
  <p>What? yer come to learn the natives how to squat on horse&rsquo;s back!<br>
    Learn the cornstalk ridin&rsquo;! Blazes!&mdash;w&rsquo;at yer giv&rsquo;n&rsquo;us,
    Texas Jack?<br>
    Learn the cornstalk&mdash;what the flamin&rsquo;, jumptup! where&rsquo;s
    my country gone?<br>
    Why, the cornstalk&rsquo;s mother often rides the day afore he&rsquo;s born!</p>
  <p>You may talk about your ridin&rsquo; in the city, bold an&rsquo; free,<br>
    Talk o&rsquo; ridin&rsquo; in the city, Texas Jack, but where&rsquo;d yer
    be<br>
    When the stock horse snorts an&rsquo; bunches all &rsquo;is quarters in a
    hump,<br>
    And the saddle climbs a sapling, an&rsquo; the horse-shoes split a stump?</p>
  <p>No, before yer teach the native you must ride without a fall<br>
    Up a gum or down a gully nigh as steep as any wall&mdash;<br>
    You must swim the roarin&rsquo; Darlin&rsquo; when the flood is at its height<br>
    Bearin&rsquo; down the stock an&rsquo; stations to the great Australian Bight.</p>
  <p>You can&rsquo;t count the bulls an&rsquo; bisons that yer copped with your
    lassoo&mdash;<br>
    But a stout old myall bullock p&rsquo;raps &rsquo;ud learn yer somethin&rsquo; new;<br>
    Yer&rsquo;d better make yer will an&rsquo; leave yer papers neat an&rsquo; trim<br>
    Before yer make arrangements for the lassooin&rsquo; of him;<br>
    Ere you &rsquo;n&rsquo; yer horse is catsmeat, fittin&rsquo; fate for sich
    galoots,<br>
    And yer saddle&rsquo;s turned to laces like we put in blucher boots.</p>
  <p>And yer say yer death on Injins! We&rsquo;ve got somethin&rsquo;in yer line&mdash;<br>
    If yer think your fitin&rsquo;s ekal to the likes of Tommy Ryan.<br>
    Take yer karkass up to Queensland where the allygators chew<br>
    And the carpet-snake is handy with his tail for a lassoo;</p>
  <p>Ride across the hazy regins where the lonely emus wail<br>
    An&rsquo; ye&rsquo;ll find the black&rsquo;ll track yer while yer lookin&rsquo; for
    his trail;<br>
    He can track yer without stoppin&rsquo; for a thousand miles or more&mdash;<br>
    Come again, and he will show yer where yer spit the year before.<br>
    But yer&rsquo;d best be mighty careful, you&rsquo;ll be sorry you kem here<br>
    When yer skewered to the fakements of yer saddle with a spear&mdash;<br>
    When the boomerang is sailin&rsquo; in the air, may heaven help yer!<br>
    It will cut yer head off goin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; come back again and skelp
    yer.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>P.S.&mdash;As poet and as Yankee I will greet you, Texas Jack,<br>
    For it isn&rsquo;t no ill-feelin&rsquo; that is gettin&rsquo; up my back,<br>
    But I won&rsquo;t see this land crowded by each Yank and British cuss<br>
    Who takes it in his head to come a-civilisin&rsquo; us.<br>
    So if you feel like shootin&rsquo; now, don&rsquo;t let yer pistol cough&mdash;<br>
    (Our Government is very free at chokin&rsquo; fellers off);<br>
    And though on your great continent there&rsquo;s misery in the towns<br>
    An&rsquo; not a few untitled lords and kings without their crowns,<br>
    I will admit your countrymen is busted big, an&rsquo; free,<br>
    An&rsquo; great on ekal rites of men and great on liberty;</p>
  <p>I will admit yer fathers punched the gory tyrant&rsquo;s head,<br>
    But then we&rsquo;ve got our heroes, too, the diggers that is dead&mdash;<br>
    The plucky men of Ballarat who toed the scratch right well<br>
    And broke the nose of Tyranny and made his peepers swell<br>
    For yankin&rsquo; Lib.&rsquo;s gold tresses in the roarin&rsquo; days gone
    by,<br>
    An&rsquo; doublin&rsquo; up his dirty fist to black her bonny eye;<br>
    So when it comes to ridin&rsquo; mokes, or hoistin&rsquo; out the Chow,<br>
    Or stickin&rsquo; up for labour&rsquo;s rights, we don&rsquo;t want showin&rsquo; how.<br>
    They come to learn us cricket in the days of long ago,<br>
    An&rsquo; Hanlan come from Canada to learn us how to row,<br>
    An&rsquo; &lsquo;doctors&rsquo; come from &rsquo;Frisco just to learn us
    how to skite,<br>
    An&rsquo; &lsquo;pugs&rsquo; from all the lands on earth to learn us how
    to fight;<br>
    An&rsquo; when they go, as like or not, we find we&rsquo;re taken in,<br>
    They&rsquo;ve left behind no larnin&rsquo;&mdash;but they&rsquo;ve carried
    off our tin.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheGroganGrumbleSteeplechase"></a>The Grog-an&rsquo;-Grumble Steeplechase</b></h2>
  <p>&rsquo;Twixt&nbsp;the coastline and the border lay the town of Grog-an&rsquo;-Grumble<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days before the bushman was a dull &rsquo;n&rsquo; heartless
  drudge,<br>
    An&rsquo; they say the local meeting was a drunken rough-and-tumble,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which was ended pretty often by an inquest on the judge.<br>
    An&rsquo; &rsquo;tis said the city talent very often caught a tartar<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Grog-an&rsquo;-Grumble sportsman, &rsquo;n&rsquo; retired
  with broken heads,<br>
    For the fortune, life, and safety of the Grog-an&rsquo;-Grumble starter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mostly hung upon the finish of the local thorough-breds.</p>
  <p>Pat M&lsquo;Durmer was the owner of a horse they called the Screamer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which he called the &lsquo;quickest shtepper &rsquo;twixt
  the Darling and the sea;&rsquo;<br>
    And I think it&rsquo;s very doubtful if the stomach-troubled dreamer<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever saw a more outrageous piece of equine scenery;<br>
    For his points were most decided, from his end to his beginning,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had eyes of difrerent colour, and his legs they
  wasn&rsquo;t mates.<br>
    Pat M&lsquo;Durmer said he always came &lsquo;widin a flip av winnin&rsquo;,&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; his sire had come from England, &rsquo;n&rsquo; his
  dam was from the States.</p>
  <p>Friends would argue with M&lsquo;Durmer, and they said he was in error<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put up his horse the Screamer, for he&rsquo;d lose
  in any case,<br>
    And they said a city racer by the name of Holy Terror<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was regarded as the winner of the coming steeple-chase;<br>
    But he said he had the knowledge to come in when it was raining,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And irrelevantly mentioned that he knew the time of
  day,<br>
    So he rose in their opinion. It was noticed that the training<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Screamer was conducted in a dark, mysterious
  way.</p>
  <p>Well, the day arrived in glory; &rsquo;twas a day of jubilation<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With careless-hearted bushmen for a hundred miles around,<br>
    An&rsquo; the rum &rsquo;n&rsquo; beer &rsquo;n&rsquo; whisky came in waggons
    from the station,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; the Holy Terror talent were the first upon
  the ground.<br>
    Judge M&lsquo;Ard&mdash;with whose opinion it was scarcely safe to wrestle&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took his dangerous position on the bark-and-sapling
  stand:<br>
    He was what the local Stiggins used to speak of as a &lsquo;wessel<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Of wrath,&rsquo; and he&rsquo;d a bludgeon that
  he carried in his hand.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Off ye go!&rsquo; the starter shouted, as down fell a stupid jockey&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Off they started in disorder&mdash;left the jockey
  where he lay&mdash;<br>
    And they fell and rolled and galloped down the crooked course and rocky,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the pumping of the Screamer could be heard a mile
  away.<br>
    But he kept his legs and galloped; he was used to rugged courses,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he lumbered down the gully till the ridge began
  to quake:<br>
    And he ploughed along the siding, raising earth till other horses<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; their riders, too, were blinded by the dust-cloud
  in his wake.</p>
  <p>From the ruck he&rsquo;d struggled slowly&mdash;they were much surprised
    to find him<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close abeam of Holy Terror as along the flat they tore&mdash;<br>
    Even higher still and denser rose the cloud of dust behind him,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in more divided splinters flew the shattered
  rails before.<br>
  &lsquo;Terror!&rsquo; &lsquo;Dead heat!&rsquo; they were shouting&mdash;&lsquo;Terror!&rsquo; but
  the Screamer hung out<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nose to nose with Holy Terror as across the creek they
  swung,<br>
    An&rsquo; M&lsquo;Durmer shouted loudly, &lsquo;Put yer tongue out! put yer
    tongue out!&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; the Screamer put his tongue out, and he won
  by half-a-tongue.</p>

    The turkey-tail to scare the flies,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water-bag and billy;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traveller getting silly.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like gently sloping rises,<br>
    The shrubs and tufts that&rsquo;s miles away<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But magnified in sizes;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning, after shearing,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spots the Darling Timber!</p>
