<h1>The Penance of Portia James</h1>

<h3>Chapter I</h3>

<p>PORTIA JAMES had been as good as her word, and, notwithstanding the
fact that she had danced the evening before--Portia loved
dancing--until the grey dawn was actually creeping into the gas-lit
rooms, she was standing only five hours later, that is to say at eight
o'clock the same morning, on the steps of Burlington House, waiting
with a few other enthusiasts until the doors should be opened. To face
the unsparing morning light after having made what is suggestively
called a night of it, is not an experiment that can be entered upon
becomingly after the freshness of youth is past. Portia, however, was
still of an age to stand this test--and, what is more, to come out of
it triumphantly. It was her first season in London. She had abundant
health; pleasure and admiration seemed to act upon her as stimulants,
and though she had never slept so little or lived (in the sense that
living may be measured by keenness of sensation) so much as hitherto,
she had never looked fresher, younger, rosier, or more generally
blooming, than upon this particular June morning, as she stood waiting
with the thick catalogue in her hand, a confident Peri, outside the
gates of the particular Paradise she had flown from her bed at that
early hour to enter.</p>

<p>Youth and the morning were ever well mated. Did not the Greeks,
those wonderful pantheists, recognise this truth when they invoked the
ever--young Aurora to coax their world into waking life with the aid of
her rosy finger-tips? A certain young artist, who was hardly as yet out
of the rapin stage, and who had seen Portia a few evenings before in
the glory of full d&eacute;collet&eacute; with rounded bust and arms
emerging from old-rose satin--or something equally vague and charming
as regarded its hue--and who had thought on that occasion of Byron's
lines upon the score of beauty,</p>

<pre>
  "Mellowed to that tender light.
   Which Heaven to gaudy day denies," 
</pre>

<p>found himself inclined at the present moment to alter his opinion.
He had reached the Academy a little before Portia, and had watched her
unobserved as she mounted the steps. His eye, accustomed to transfer to
an imaginary canvas all that it encountered, took in every detail of
her appearance at a glance. The misty background of the London
atmosphere, which looked as though at least two of the well-known
Egyptian plagues, to wit, the reign of darkness and the rain of blood,
were struggling for supremacy over it--the simple explanation thereof
being that the sun's rays were striving to penetrate a threatening
fog--gave the indefiniteness of outline that stamps an impressionest
picture to her silhouette, as she walked. Nevertheless, Harry Tolhurst,
with the divination that comes of artistic training, was aware, as I
have said, of all the details of it. Portia had a figure that might
have inspired a Swinburnian rhapsody, and Harry did full justice to
this in his mind as she walked up the steps in a tailor-made Scotch
tweed that sat closely, but not tightly, round her exquisite form. Her
bright head was covered with one of those patulous splashes of black
lace that serve as a substratum for a garland of flowers. Perhaps it
was not quite in keeping with the tailor-made dress, but it harmonised
wonderfully well with the face that it framed; and this mention of her
face brings me to the most difficult part of my description, for the
face is supposed by most to be the crucial test or criterion by which
beauty is to be gauged. Portia, it must be owned at once, did not
possess what might be called, objectively speaking, a beautiful face.
It was a face that did not focus well, as the photographers say, and
those of her acquaintances who had only seen her photograph were
agreeably surprised when they encountered the original. In the
photographs the face was deprived of the very qualities that
constituted its principal charm--namely, softness of colouring and
mobility of expression. What is the loveliest landscape under a grey
sky compared with the same landscape when the clouds and the sunlight
sweep across it, revealing a thousand unsuspected charms? Portia in her
photographs was the landscape on a sunless day. Portia in her own
person was the landscape on a day of April showers, of summer storms,
of autumn moons, of all that makes inanimate nature live and vibrate
with human passion. To certain people, therefore--to those who could
awake corresponding phases in her--she was subjectively beautiful; and
for the fact that her eyes--of the warm hazel that accompanies chestnut
hair--were too wide apart; that her nose was too short, or her mouth
too large, they cared not one whit. Her eyes, as some of them had
discovered to their cost, could "thoroughly undo" them betimes--and
what could the most beautiful eyes of the most beautiful houri in an
Eastern Paradise do more?--and this without malice prepense on her
part, for if Portia was a coquette she was not a deliberate one. It was
for this reason that her conquests were so serious and so lasting. Men
took her seriously in spite of themselves, and none, I fear took her
more seriously than Harry Tolhurst. Indeed, it would have been at
variance with his nature to take her in any other way, for though his
vocation was that of an artist, and although he loved his vocation, his
actual bias was towards the austerity and self--renunciation of a
therapeutist, in the religious application of the term. Even as
regarded his art, he aimed at giving it a transcendental significance,
and nothing irritated him more than the French point of view respecting
art and literature, which disdains to take account of the subject that
inspires, and makes cleverness of execution on the one hand, and
perfection of literary form on the other, its sole criterion of praise
or blame.</p>

<p>Yet this very young man--the very, in this instance, does not point
to extreme youth, for Harry was approaching the thirties--was led to
take an interest in Miss James, in the first instance, for the entirely
carnal reason that she had so charming a figure. It was as he told
himself, a legitimate and artistic interest; for the pictures that he
painted, and, far beyond these, those he dreamed of painting,
necessitated the frequent study of the feminine outline. He had first
been struck by Portia's figure as she rode past him in the park, the
great clump of chestnut hair that could not be thrust under her hat
lending a certain Lady-Godiva-like association of ideas to the picture;
and he kept the vision of it in his mind until he was introduced to her
by chance at a Joachim concert, at which she was present with some
special friends of his, seated, as it happened, in his close
neighbourhood. He never forgot the harmonies he had heard on that
occasion. For ever after they seemed to blend themselves with the
vision of Portia in her summer dress, as she listened to the
heart-searching music with her eyes down, so completely under the spell
that, when she raised them at the close, there were unconscious tears
quivering on the lashes. He had thought then that such a tribute far
exceeded the clamorous applause that filled the hall, and had envied
the Master his power. But Portia's eyes were just as speaking without
the tear-drops, and, before the concert was over, Harry's ambition to
change places with Herr Joachim had passed away.</p>

<p>All that had passed between them, nevertheless, on that occasion
might have been proclaimed on the housetops. So likewise might the
conversation that followed upon their chance meeting at the house of a
mutual friend. This, however, proves nothing. The Chinese, it is said,
make the same word do duty for a hundred different meanings, according
to the key in which they utter it; and even commonplace English phrases
put on quite a new significance when they are pronounced with a certain
inflexion that differentiates them from their compeers. Still, the fact
remains that Portia and her admirer said nothing that might not have
been taken down by a shorthand reporter and printed in a manual for
daily use in crowded drawing-rooms. Even when she declared one day that
it was her firm intention to go to the Academy one of these mornings
before the doors were opened, Harry did not venture to do more than
take silent note of the same. They were not upon terms that warranted
his offering himself as a guide, but he treasured the announcement in
his heart, and thenceforth, for eight successive mornings, the
policeman on duty at the doors of Burlington House was not more
punctual in his attendance than he. On the ninth he had his reward.
Portia, alone and unattended (this sequence of words is sanctioned by
custom, though for my part I have always thought two of them were de
trop), made her appearance in the courtyard, her face bright with its
morning bloom, not quite like that of Shakespeare's schoolboy, and the
exhilaration consequent upon having successfully achieved her escapade.
She was so far from being blas&eacute;e (we greatly need an English
equivalent for this word) that she had actually derived an immense
amount of enjoyment from her solitary drive down Knightsbridge and
Piccadilly in a hansom; the heavily-branched, thickly-leaved trees in
the Park looming through the mist at an immeasurable distance, the
sloping green sward with the fat, unshorn sheep scattered over its
bountiful surface, the mighty clubs, still and solemn as temples at
that early hour--even to the opening shops and the unaccustomed aspect
of the passers-by, all more or less hurrying on their way to set the
work-a-day world going--everything she saw upon this matutinal drive
was a source of admiration or amusement to her. The muffled influence
upon sight and sound of the embryo fog exercised a mysterious charm
upon her imagination. Indeed, if it had not been that, in common with
most of us, she did not like to withdraw her hand from the plough after
she had put it thereto, I believe she would have forsworn the Academy
that morning, and exchanged the long rows of mute pictures within its
walls for the living, breathing pictures outside. As it was, and
fortunately, or perhaps unfortunately for Harry, she did nothing of the
kind. She dismissed her hansom--bestowing, in violation of feminine
canons, a tip upon the driver for the utterly inadequate motive that
his horse was black and shiny, and that she had derived a certain
amount of pleasure from the contemplation of his vigorous action as he
trotted down Piccadilly--and made her way up the steps of Burlington
House.</p>

<h3>Chapter II</h3>

<p>TO say that Portia was surprised when, upon reaching the top, she
recognised Harry Tolhurst in the tall, square, and somewhat
grave-looking young man who took off his hat as he approached her,
would not be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
Perhaps it would be safer to assume that, if his presence did not
strike her as owing its cause to an entirely miraculous coincidence,
his absence would not have appeared especially surprising to her
either.</p>

<p>In any case, she thought it advisable to feign a slight surprise,
and to greet him with a "What, you here!" and an almost imperceptible
elevation of the eyebrows (which latter, coming under the heading of
"pencilled," were one of her strong points), as though he were the last
person whom she could have expected, under the circumstances, to
encounter.</p>

<p>"I always come at this time when I come at all," he replied,
thinking doubtless of the eight successive mornings during which he had
done the pied de grue on the steps of the Academy before the doors were
opened.</p>

<p>"Oh, then you must know all the pictures by heart," said Portia,
cordially, "and you can take me straight to those I am supposed to
admire. I have a catalogue here; but it was my brother who marked
it."</p>

<p>Harry laughed, and his companion echoed the laugh. She delivered up
the book to him, for which he had extended his hand, without
accompanying the gesture by a spoken request. She was conscious of
enjoying the sense of unrestraint the early morning meeting seemed to
bring with it. It amused her to watch his face as he scanned the
catalogue. The brother to whom she had referred, who was actually her
step-brother, and some seven-and-twenty years older than herself, had
brought his own unaided judgment to bear upon his selection of the
pictures that were to guide his little sister's taste; and the result
seemed to furnish a certain amount of inward amusement to her friend,
which was plainly reflected in his face. The Philistine point of view
is indeed a never-failing source of mirth to the adept, when it does
not irritate him--a fact, however, which does not prevent certain
cliques of artists from demolishing certain other opposing cliques. For
it is not only doctors who differ, as the saying has it, for the
confusion of the uninitiated, but apostles of every calling and every
pretension under the sun. Otherwise, where would be the point in
Pilate's famous question?</p>

<p>Portia was in no wise offended by her friend's amused expression.
Truth to tell, she would have liked to see it upon his face a little
oftener. Its habitual cast was set in too severe a mould. He had
excessively dark, deep--set eyes, and their normal aspect was of those
of a man who broods. The complexion was sallow, and would have
suggested liver to the materially disposed. The mouth was in a great
measure concealed under a drooping black moustache; but its lines, as
far as could be seen, were indicative of a somewhat cheerless
disposition of mind. One could almost imagine that the sable-coloured
eyes and hair had given their hue to the temperament. When this chronic
gloom gave way to a rare smile, the effect was like that of intense
sunlight against the background of an inky sky, which, as everyone
knows, has an irradiating effect upon the landscape. Harry's smile was
almost a revelation to Portia. Her appreciation of it inclined her to
see the pictures under his guidance with quite a new zest; and, the
doors being opened, they passed in together upon the easy footing of a
pair of old friends, instead of that of two young people who were
hovering upon the brink of a flirtation. The catalogue remained in
Harry's hands, definitely closed.</p>

<p>"But you might mark a fresh lot," said Portia, pleadingly. "I'm sure
to mix up the pictures you show me with those my brother wanted me to
see. Don't you think any of them were worth marking, then?"</p>

<p>"Not any that I have seen so far," said Harry, frankly. Whereat they
both laughed again.</p>

<p>"Poor Wilmer," said Portia. (Wilmer, originally a baptismal name,
had become the prefix by which her elder brother's name of plain James
had become converted into that of Wilmer-James.) "As long as I remember
him--even when we were living in the bush out in Australia, you
know--he used to talk about Claudes and Ruysdaels as though he knew all
about them. I had the profoundest belief in his knowledge until we came
home; but I have lost faith in so many things since then."</p>

<p>"He has a kind of a picture-gallery, hasn't he?" said Harry, in
tones that were alike doubtful and encouraging.</p>

<p>"Yes; he has a kind of a one," repeated Portia, briskly; then with a
wicked look in her eyes, "principally old masters."</p>

<p>"Old masters!" Harry's tone was distinctly sceptical. "All his own
selection, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, all!" Here Portia's voice betrayed the triumph she felt.
"Ruysdaels and Claudes--those are his favourites. He went over to the
Hotel Dieu last week for a sale, and he brought back a Claude about
that big"--(there were vestiges of colonial looseness of expression in
Portia's conversation that occasionally disconcerted her
hearers)--"just about, I should think"--she indicated a space of some
half-yard square with her hands as she spoke. "I was told that the
thing to admire in it was a kind of coppery glow; and I could see
that," doubtfully; "but then I could see nothing else. Would you admire
such a picture, do you think?"</p>

<p>"I should like to see it first," said Harry guardedly. He was
thinking that a private view, under Portia's guidance, of the
remarkable gallery of the "old-master"-bitten Australian would be a
charming sequel to their walk round the Academy this morning.</p>

<p>"Would you? I'm sure Wilmer would be delighted to show it you,
then," declared Portia, innocently. "But now let us set to work. I
wonder if I shall have the courage to tell you what pictures I like.
You can always tell me why I shouldn't and mustn't."</p>

<p>"I dare say you should and must most of the time. I have a great
belief in your natural instincts as regards art--"</p>

<p>"Like Wilmer," she interrupted him. "Only it's not art, but wine. He
will insist on making me taste his old 'cru'--doesn't that sound
learned?--and the Australian wines he gets from his Yarraman vines. He
says wine should be judged by a pure, unvitiated palate; and
somehow--it's very funny--but I do generally manage to guess
right."</p>

<p>All this time Harry had been leading her through rooms Nos. 1 and 2,
with never a pause on the way. Portia was vaguely aware of canvases
bright with brilliant sea-shores, and green rivers whereon white-robed
damsels were afloat in greener boats. She would have liked to stop
before some of these, but he led her on relentlessly until he brought
her up before a portrait by Herkomer, which he bade her look at and
tell him what she thought of it. Portia, was interested at once.</p>

<p>"But then there is something to be said for the model," she
observed, after she had admired it with unaffected heartiness. "One
would say there was such a straightforward soul looking through those
eyes, wouldn't one? That must make it much easier, I should think, for
an artist."</p>

<p>"Much easier," assented Harry. "A true portrait-painter finds
himself in the position of a kind of involuntary Father Confessor. But
I wasn't thinking so much of the expression as the work."</p>

<p>And thereupon he entered into considerations of drawing, and
colouring, and technique, which, being all new to Portia, gave her the
sensation of being led to the threshold of some vast unexplored region,
peopled with ideal presentments of all the persons and objects she
encountered in her everyday life.</p>

<p>"Oh, how I wish I had been born an artist," she said
enthusiastically, after nearly two hours--she had forgotten all about
the limits of her leave of absence by this time--had been spent in
going from picture to picture at Harry's bidding. "You must find your
life very full and happy always."</p>

<p>"Indeed I don't. It is the life of a Sisyphus, for the most part.
What, are you going away already? Well, there is just one little
painting I should like you to see before you go. I won't give you any
opinion about it. I want to know whether you like it yourself."</p>

<p>His voice sounded nervous and hurried, and Portia was perfectly
aware that the picture she was expected to be honest about was his own.
She hoped in her heart she would like it. Without establishing the
standard laid down in the novels of the Flowery Empire for the
regulation of the affections which makes Passion dependent upon the
proficiency in classic lore of the adored object, she could not help
feeling that she would like Mr. Tolhurst better if his work appealed to
her sympathies. But when she finally found herself confronted with it,
she was obliged to admit that the first impression was one of
bewilderment and non-comprehension. Harry had chosen for his theme the
hackneyed subject--old as the seasons, and young as spring-time--of the
Madonna and Child. To Portia, who had never seen Munkacsy's "Christ
before Pilate," nor "The Last Supper" of Uhde, with its wondrous stamp
of mystic realism, there was something so unaccustomed in the modern
treatment of the theme that she was aghast. The Madonna was a young
woman in flesh and blood like herself--of a commoner type--"only so
much handsomer," she added mentally--and the expression in her dark
eyes was rather one of wistful pride than of confident glorification.
She had working fingers, and the hands which held the child on her lap
had evidently known manual labour. Portia could not appreciate the
conscientious execution of the Jewish garb in white and blue, for all
her interest was centered upon the manner in which the faces had been
treated. The picture of the child--a realistic presentment of an
eighteen-months-old infant, with curiously solemn, prominent blue
eyes--seemed to arrest her attention. After a long and puzzled pause,
she turned her face towards her companion. Harry had never seen it look
so grave before.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said interrogatively--there had been many people in front
of the picture when they had first approached it, but now the place was
vacant--"what do you make of it?"</p>

<p>"I can hardly say," answered Portia--her voice had a little tremor
in it. "I am going through such a curious experience. How or where I
cannot say--but I have seen something like that picture before. I have
seen it or I have dreamed it. Don't you know what it is to meet a face
in the street that recalls some other face? you cannot tell whose? Or
to have the impression of a dream when you wake in the morning that you
can never, never lay hold of? That is how I feel in front of your
picture. It makes me almost fancy that I have stood here with you
before, and that I know what you are going to say. I am afraid it
prevents me from looking at it properly... It is very good, though,
isn't it!"--she added hurriedly and demurely.</p>

<p>For all reply Harry was rude enough to laugh. He laughed so
genuinely and with such thorough enjoyment that Portia, somewhat
abashed, laughed too. What was more, he did not even excuse himself for
his laughter. But it was impossible to be offended by it, for the
reason that it conveyed a subtle assurance that whatever she had said
to move it, far from being displeasing to him, was something that had
only drawn him closer to her. In an instant, however, he had become
grave again. "You ask me if it is very good--well, no. To give you my
candid opinion, I think it is very bad. I am sorry I exposed it, as the
French call it. But what you say about your being reminded of something
you have seen before is a puzzle to me. I believe you are one of the
most truthful persons I ever met--no, I don't jump at conclusions--but
I have watched you as you looked at the pictures, and I am sure of what
I say--yet you can't have seen anything like this before. The picture
has never been out of my studio."</p>

<p>"I can't account for it either," said Portia, plaintively; "but the
feeling is there, all the same. And what is the most uncomfortable, it
suggests something unhappy. How I wish I could explain it. Do you
believe in spirits and all that kind of thing?"</p>

<p>"Believe there are things undreamed of in our philosophy? Of course
I do. Everyone who thinks at all must believe that much."</p>

<p>"Then you think an impression like this one of mine may have
something in it?"</p>

<p>She put the question anxiously, for the vague foreboding that had
come upon her as her eyes first encountered the picture seemed to gain
in consistence as she looked more closely into it. The prominent blue
orbs of the child, with their unabashed infant gaze, threatened to
haunt her in the days to come.</p>

<p>"What can it mean?" she said again, without waiting for Harry's
reply. No one could give a satisfactory solution of the mystery, which
was, after all, entirely a subjective one. But as she parted from her
companion at the outer gate of Burlington House, in the midst of the
later fashionable throng, her erst-while joyousness seemed to have
departed from her. He reproached himself with having allowed her to
over-tire herself.</p>

<p>"You went at the pictures with all the zeal of a neophyte," he said,
"and I never thought of holding you back. You should have told me you
were getting tired."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I wasn't indeed," she assured him eagerly. "I did enjoy
seeing them so much, until--" she stopped short, and gave vent to her
emotion in a half-hysterical little laugh. "I'm afraid you must think
me so awfully silly--"</p>

<p>"What, I? Think you silly! Oh, my dear Miss James!"</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly; annoyed at the weakness of his own disclaimer.
Yet what was he to do? The very longing that beset him to say so much
more than he had any warrant for saying seemed, in biblical phrase, to
place a bridle on his tongue and check his utterance; and the parting
between the two was so formal that no one could have suspected that he
was actually carrying away a corner of Portia's heart that morning,
leaving Heaven knows how large a share of his own behind him in
exchange.</p>

<h3>Chapter III</h3>

<p>HURRYING back to Waratah Lodge, whereby the Kensington abode of
Wilmer James, standing in its own quarter of an acre of garden, was
known, Portia found there would be only time to get into later-day trim
before luncheon. Her room, overlooking a riotous rose-bud, was a
pleasant place to fritter away the time in. There were mirrors in
white-enamel frames that multiplied her figure in all manner of
unconsciously-becoming poses, and a square, low, Liberty-draped couch
that might have inclined the most prosaic to maiden meditation of a
pleasantly-dreamy description. The porcelain blues and whites of carpet
and curtains--the yellow fever of decoration had not as yet broken out
in every household--were suggestive of coolness and cleanliness. A
white, pagoda-shaped cage, containing two budgery-guards, that Portia
had brought all the way from her bush-home--a cage large enough to
allow the love-sick Hebraic-looking little birds to play at pursuing
each other through space after a period of unlimited fondling--stood
upon a table near the window. The bed in the corner, under its soft
concealment of blue and white crinkly curtains, became an unobtrusive
appendage to the rest of the furniture in a room of such ample
dimensions. The pretty trifles that are set forth in the West End shops
every succeeding season, with a view to exciting a conflagration in the
pockets of those whose money is popularly supposed to "burn" therein,
were not wanting in Portia's room. The "chastest" china set--(will not
the eighteenth-century use of this adjective, which, according to
dictionary authorities, should only be applied to a rosi&egrave;re or a
word, be something of a stumbling-block to philologists of the
future?)--the chastest china-set, I say, adorned her five-o'clock
tea-table. There was a minature cuckoo-clock on the draped
mantle-piece, and white and gold book-shelves bore a heterogeneous
assemblage of the latest novels, poems, and nondescript specimens of
the generally talked-about order of literature. Portia's tastes were
nothing if not eclectic, and when she found the time to read, which was
not very often, she could take up with equal appreciation a chapter of
Aurora Leigh or the latest delightfully extravagant American absurdity.
I have no desire to furnish in this connection a complete catalogue of
all her possessions, but the one object in her room that she would not
have allowed us to overlook was her writing-table, made to order in
celebration of her twenty-first birthday, by her brother's command--a
munificent gift, for he had himself discovered (and knew what he had
paid for it) the authentic Wouvermans enshrined in the lid. For the
further protection of the precious memento, Wilmer had designed a
square cover, like an inverted box, which was placed over the
writing-table when it was not in use, and which gave it very much the
appearance of a Singer's sewing--machine. This, indeed, was the normal
aspect it presented, for Portia found it easier to scribble off her
correspondence at an unassuming white--enamel-painted table, whereon
her buvard, in old-stamped leather, found its resting-place. On the day
of her return from the Academy, however, her eyes were instantly
attracted to the writing-table by the sight of a magnificent bunch of
flowers lying upon the sewing-machine lid, made up of all manner of
blooms in season and out of season. But it was not the costly charm of
speckled orchids or scentless camellias that attracted her gaze. It was
the sight of an assemblage of yellow-beaded mimosa--branches, with
blossoms of such an amazing quality of thick fluffiness that the
almond-scent they scattered around them seemed to permeate all the air.
As she beheld these flowers, Portia's face gathered a new and singular
expression. The charming London room, with its wealth of so-called art
equipments, its Bond Street bibelots and veiled London atmosphere, all
melted away. She was riding across the far-away Australian plains on a
Spring day in September, and around and above her the dark wattle-trees
were shining in their gold-spangled robes. She could see again the
vision of a man's face next to hers, moving up and down with the
horse's trot--the reddish beard and moustache concealing lips that had
a curious trick of appearing to be for ever engaged in the action of
tasting, when he was not making use of them in speech; the sanguine hue
of the hairy cheeks, and the blue eyes set, as the French express it,
&agrave; fleur de t&eacute;te. She could see herself, a "mere slip of a
girl," with a massive plait hanging down her back, the end trailing
over the saddle, listening to the man's words as he sought to make her
understand that, child as she was at that time, she was yet the one
maid in all the world for him. She had believed what he had said then,
and she was fain to believe it now. She had imagined in those days that
the exultant sense of being a power in the world, of carrying some
potent magic about with her, that this first wooing had brought with it
(as, indeed, a first wooing brings in every case), was the going-out of
her heart in response to the appeal she had heard. With the
wattle-blooms for sole witnesses she had allowed the face so near her
to come yet nearer still. The horse's flanks were rubbing against each
other, and an arm had pressed itself close around the body of her
little holland habit, as they went at a walking pace. The red-bearded
face had been on a level with her own now--John Morrisson, truth to
tell, was a head and shoulders taller than she, but women ride higher
than men--and the ever-tasting lips had been suffered at last to feed
upon her own. She had even allowed him to pull up the little gauze veil
that protected her against the Australian sun and the Australian flies,
and this first kiss had been understood to signify the seal of her
betrothal. Well, she had been young enough then, in all conscience, to
make so solemn an engagement; but John, who was at least twenty years
older, had held her to it. He was her step-brother's partner, but
neither of the men had as yet developed the Midas-like faculty they
afterwards acquired of turning all they touched into gold. Portia's
engagement--she was only sixteen--was nevertheless interpreted as a
serious obligation by the head of the house, and nothing but her own
passionate pleading that she should not be married until she was
twenty-one had saved her from becoming that saddest of sacramental
victims, a child wife. The following year the great silver discovery
had been made. John Morrisson was credited with the first preception of
the marvellous possibilities concealed under a strip of Queensland
bush, but Wilmer James had been the one to secretly test the ore, and
to bring the wondrous discovery to a head. To wake and find ourselves
famous is, perhaps, a more frequent experience in these days of rapid
reputations than to wake and find ourselves millionaires. This, was,
however, the wonderful fate that befell Portia's brother and his
partner. Within a couple of years of the discovery, they were rich in
the eternally-quoted Johnsonian sense of the word. Wilmer had brought
his wife and step-sister to England. John had remained to superintend
the carrying on of the great silver-mine operations, or, in Australian
parlance, to "boss the concern." It was understood that he should not
appear upon the horizon--Portia's horizon, that was to say--until she
had completed her twenty-first year. She was within eighteen months of
it at the time of her sailing.</p>

<p>The period of European travelling that followed, during which Wilmer
had struck out wildly in the direction of Claudes and Ruysdaels, the
furnishing of the Kensington house, and the first experience of a real
London season--all these had represented a dream of delight to Portia.
Why did the dream seem to be checked by a rude awakening this morning,
as she looked at the wattle-blooms that greeted her so unexpectedly,
and read in their golden blobs the mute message that John Morrisson had
come home? Come home! Come, then, to claim his promise. Come for her!
The recollection of the free and happy experience of her morning among
the pictures rushed into her mind, and with it, and against it, and
mingled in some incomprehensible way with the image of John himself,
the vision of the picture of Harry's Madonna and Child flashed through
her brain. Had the picture, then, brought her a presentiment of her
approaching fate? What possible network of disconnected ideas could
have entangled the Madonna and her Child and John Morrisson in the same
meshes! "I should go mad if I were to attempt to make sense of it,"
said Portia--I am not sure that in her thoughts, for she spoke to
herself, she did not say, to "make head or tail of it"--and thereupon
she made her way towards the flowers with a gait quite unlike the one
that had been remarked by Harry Tolhurst on the steps of the Academy
only a few hours previously. She was holding the flowers up to her
face--wattle-blossoms were, in any case, objectively lovely, no matter
through what channel they reached her--when the door was opened from
outside, after it had been smartly tapped upon, by someone who did not
even wait for her to say "Come in."</p>

<p>Portia turned her head with the dignity of an offended queen, but
her lips relaxed into a smile as she recognised the large Teutonic face
of her sister--in-law, with grey frisettes surmounting her forehead and
the fixed red upon the high cheek-bones that advancing years, rather
than the rouge-pot, had placed there. Mrs. James had found favour in
her lord's sight some thirty years previously, at a period when youth
had condoned the unattested mould of her features. She had been engaged
in the task of bringing up the daughters of a neighbouring squatter in
guttural German-English and the belief that Goethe was the light of the
world, when Mr. James married her, so to speak, off hand. Eligible
brides were rare upon the Lachlan in those days. Mrs. James proved
herself as good a Haus-frau as she had been a worshipper of Goethe, and
when, some fifteen years later, her husband's orphaned step-sister was
sent up to him from Melbourne for protection, she took the little
creature to her heart in the place of the child she would fain have
borne him, and brought her up with tender care according to her lights.
Mr. James did not understand German, and I fear Portia's knowledge of
it did not extend very far beyond the "Ach Gotts," "Gott in Himmels,"
and "So's," that she heard her step-sister utter a hundred times a day.
Since her sudden accession to wealth Mrs. James had resuscitated a
legend that had been almost forgotten during her active existence of
squatter's helpmate in the Australian wilds--a legend whereby the stock
whence she came was adelig, and she herself, as well as her sisters,
cousins, and aunts, were adelig likewise. Portia heard for the first
time of her step-sister's uncle--a Rittmeister von something--who had
married the daughter of a Graf. It had been always understood that they
should see these great people when they came to Europe; but beyond a
visit to a stuffy pension, conducted by the Rittmeister's widowed
daughter, nothing had come of it. Mrs. James had explained that no one
who was not adelig was allowed to become an inmate of the
establishment, and Portia had noticed that a coronet was insinuated
into all the crochet-worked antimacassars that encumbered the
sad-looking reception-room. On the other hand, the furniture was
terribly threadbare, and there was a pungent aroma of biersuppe from
the kitchen, which, coupled with an utter absence of ventilation in the
sitting-room, inspired Portia (though she did not say so to her
step-mother) with a pr&eacute;vention--prejudice, perhaps, would be too
strong a word--against all that was adelig in the German sense. In
England, in the beautiful Kensington mansion, Mrs. James gave the reins
to her fancy in another direction. She had always been economical in
her dress--in Germany she had clothed herself in her youthful days upon
eighty-five marks a year. But now she developed a truly Oriental
imagination as regarded the trailing glories of her attire. She would
array her portly body in robes that the Queen of Sheba might have worn,
and, the silver mine being apparently inexhaustible, she cultivated a
taste for old lace as a pendant to her husband's taste for old masters,
with at least a like success.</p>

<p>Her hasty entrance into Portia's room this morning was with the
obvious motive, first, of imparting some startling piece of news, and,
secondly, dazzling her vision by her appearance in a gorgeous gown of
peacock blue, with a trimming that looked like the encrusted bands of
jewels that adorned the gowns of Byzantine empresses. But there was a
kind heart under the glittering adornments. Beholding a certain
distressful look in Portia's eyes, after the smile had died out of
them, Mrs. James plumped down into a chair, with a gesture not quite
consistent with her mediaeval magnificence, and said, with deep-voiced
sympathy--</p>

<p>"Ach meine Liebe! wherefore art thou sad?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sad," said Portia, hastily; she put the flowers away from
her as she spoke; then, with a sudden, inconsistent change of
demeanour, she turned her face towards the elder woman. Her eyes were
full of tears. "Oh, Emma! what shall I do!" she cried in a choked
voice.</p>

<p>"Liebchen! Herzchen!" the incrusted trimming, with its aggressive
irregularities, forbade the warm-hearted Emma from pressing the young
girl's head to her heart, but she stood up and kissed her and led her
to the confessional couch, and taking the cold young hands into her
own, which were of an uncompromisingly beefy hue, but warm and
sympathising withal, she said: "Now! you will bore out your heart to
me, Liebchen," and so waited for her to speak.</p>

<p>To put a dramatic sentiment into fitting words with a large, fat,
expectant face looking anxiously into yours, is not always an easy
matter. Portia felt a strong inclination to laugh, though at heart she
was in no laughing mood. She compromised matters by covering her face
with her disengaged hand, as she murmured weakly: "I don't like the
thought of leaving you and Wilmer, Emma. This year has flown by so, and
you see there--I have my summons."</p>

<p>She nodded in the direction of the magnificent flowers scattered
over the cover of the writing-table. The wattle-blossoms lay with their
rich yellow down uppermost, and Emma knew just what they signified.</p>

<p>"Ach! he is so fond of you," she whispered; the idea that Portia was
casting about for a possible means of gaining time, and deferring the
fulfilment of her promise (she dared not think yet of breaking it
altogether), never seemed to occur to her. "He will be by us to-day at
lunch"--prepositions had never been able to take their relative places
in the English sense in Emma's brain.</p>

<p>"At lunch!" repeated Portia, in tones that savoured more of terror
than of rapture. "Then you have seen him already. What does he look
like? What did he say?"</p>

<p>"He said, 'I got not away until I have seen her, Now, it was to tell
you he waits below, I must run so rash into you room awhile ago. Ach!
how white you look then, my treasure. Gott in Himmel! one would say you
were even disposing yourself to faint."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! I never fainted in my life." Portia's tone had taken a
sudden resolve, but the fact that the blood had fled from her cheeks,
leaving them, for an instant, of an unnatural whiteness, was
incontestable. "He is below, you say. I will go to him at once. Is he
alone?"</p>

<p>Mrs. James nodded signficantly. "In the library--there awaits he
alone your coming. Now--"</p>

<p>But Portia was gone before she could say more. The black-lace,
flowered-wreathed hat was thrown aside, and she was running swiftly
down the broad, heavily-carpeted stairs. A sudden and desperate
resolution had seized her while her sister-in-law had been talking.
Alas! that our "high resolves" should be so difficult of execution. By
the time her fingers were on the handle of the library door, her
courage was oozing out at the tips of them. After all, what possible
pretext could she advance for becoming a renegade from her word! Had
she not come to Europe in the character of an engaged girl? Did not
everyone who had seen the parting on the mail-steamer between herself
and John Morrisson know she was his affianced wife? Had her brother,
her sister-in-law, the very servants who had come home with them, her
Australian friends, any doubt that she belonged to him prospectively?
Had not their English friends--everybody indeed, excepting recent and
casual acquaintances, like Harry Tolhurst for instance--been apprised
of the fact? Moreover, in what were her relations with her betrothed,
or the world in general, changed since she had seen him last? Was it
only that the eternal reproach levelled by Hamlet at her sex might have
been addressed to her individually? Was she frail, and fickle, and
false by nature, that after hardly eighteen months' separation from the
man to whom she had pledged herself, she should feel--without any
assignable motive--that she would have been beholden to him for staying
away yet longer? Under the influence of a flood of similar reflections,
Portia slowly turned the handle of the library door, and entered, as
one walking in her sleep, into the presence of John Morrisson.</p>

<h3>Chapter IV</h3>

<p>WHATEVER Portia might have contemplated saying, before she entered
the room, the mere physical power to utter it was taken from her ere
she was well inside, for she had hardly had time to close the door
after her, when she found herself enveloped in so close an embrace that
she was literally deprived of breath. She was conscious of being kissed
with hungry, devouring kisses, upon forehead, lips and neck, until she
was fain to plant her two small hands against the great shoulders that
overshadowed her and push them away (after the fashion in which the man
of Thessaly jumped into the quick-set hedge) that is to say, with all
her "might and main."</p>

<p>"How can you?" she cried, flushing and panting. "How cruel of you!
You hurt me so, and you frighten me so!"</p>

<p>"My darling, my darling!" he said, releasing her. "Haven't we a two
years' score to settle?"</p>

<p>He held her at arm's length from him, half-seated upon the edge of
the library table, and scanned with eager scrutiny her face and figure.
She had a kind of helpless sense that he was appraising her--taking in
her points, indeed, as she had seen him do upon the station when he was
judging a young horse that had been recently run in. (His judgment as
regarded a horse or a sheep was that of an expert.) His lips had not
lost their old trick of tasting (with nothing tangible before them to
taste), while he was thinking. Portia reflected that he was bigger and
burlier than when she had last seen him. There were people who even now
would have considered him a handsome man, in a Henry VIII. or William
Rufus kind of way. She had never been aware before of the curious
hue--a sort of opaque blue--of his globular eyes. She made these
observations half-unconsciously to herself as she stood in his powerful
grasp. The somewhat rough handling she had experienced had produced a
singular feeling of lassitude, and though--as she had declared to her
sister-in-law a few moments back--she had never fainted in her life,
and was not in the least what is called an hysterical subject, she felt
now as though to creep into a dark room, and there lie down and cry
herself to sleep, would be an untold relief.</p>

<p>She uttered, nevertheless, no protest while her lover was
contemplating her, remaining passive until he made a movement as though
to draw her towards him again. This she resisted.</p>

<p>"You're a lot prettier than you used to be," was his verdict, when
she had finally suffered him to pass his arm around her waist, as she
stood by his side, with her back supported against the table. "You were
pretty enough out in the bush, but you're bewitchingly pretty now. I
expect you've had no end of fellows after you in London. Come now, tell
me all about it!"</p>

<p>"There's nothing to tell," said Portia, gravely. Her voice sounded
like a funeral knell in her own ears. "We were travelling, as you know,
until quite lately, and we don't know nearly as many people here as we
did in Melbourne. How was it"--with a forced attempt to resume her
natural manner--"you were able to come home so much sooner than you
expected, Mr. Morrisson?"</p>

<p>"Don't you Mr. Morrisson me," said John, turning her face towards
his own for another kiss; "or I'll make you pay a double forfeit every
time. Well, you were asking about the coming home. I wasn't due for six
weeks, was I?"</p>

<p>"No, not for six whole weeks," she replied with a sigh. This was a
form of assent that was open to two interpretations. It might, from one
point of view, have been construed in the most unflattering sense to
the person to whom it was given. John elected (as he would have said
himself) to give it the contrary signification.</p>

<p>"Six whole weeks!" he repeated, "that's a devil of a time to a man
in love, Portia, and I've been in love with you now for over five
years. I've been working like a demon to square up accounts and get
home. Thank the Lord, that time's over, and now we can get fixed up as
soon as you please."</p>

<p>She was silent. The numbness of despair was creeping over her, and
curiously enough, as the prospect of losing her liberty loomed in
terrible proximity before her mental gaze, the obtrusive vision of
Harry Tolhurst's Madonna and Child coupled itself in her mind with her
impending destiny. She could see once more the wistful eyes of the
Virgin-mother looking out from their frame of strong black hair, and
the unabashed gaze that marked the intent blue orbs of the Child. The
impression of the whole was as strong as though it had been actually
photographed on her brain, and she was so overcome by it that for a
moment she almost forgot the actual business on hand, as the commercial
people say--a business, nevertheless, that was of mighty import to
herself.</p>

<p>And here I must put in a word in behalf of Portia's apparently
helpless and weak-minded course of action, two epithets which certainly
do not apply to her character, however much her conduct may appear
deserving of them. If her approaching marriage was actually becoming in
her eyes the prototype of the sword which the wretched Damocles saw--as
the juvenile story-books tell us--"suspended over his head by a single
hair," why did she consent to dally under the same? She was still her
own mistress, in the sense that she had not been through the dread
ceremony which obliges a woman to swear eternal love and constancy and
obedience to inconstant man, and might reasonably be supposed to have
been able to withdraw her word. Against this supposition, however,
there is more than one argument to be advanced, of which I will only
mention those that had most weight with Portia herself. In the first
place, it was now, as John Morrisson himself had reminded her, more
than five years since she had given him her troth. He had never, as she
firmly believed, looked with eyes of longing in the direction of any
other woman whatsoever since. Not that Portia thought very much of this
accredited warrant of a sole and exclusive passion. Despite her varied
reading, she had retained, as regarded many vexed questions an artless
mind, and believed that people--men especially--did many things in
books that they would never dream of doing in real life, and that, on
the whole, exo-connubial affections were mainly to be met with in
romances. In her own innocent eyes she was more than half married to
John already, and this feeling assisted the aforementioned one of her
belief in his enduring love, to hold her bound to him. What assurance
could she give herself if now, at the end of his five years' probation,
she should drive him away for no other reason than a want of fidelity
on her own part--what assurance could she have that the same
contingency might not occur the next time she should lose (or fancy she
lost) her heart to somebody else? It was not as though she had given
way to a sudden engouement and repented of it a week later, for she had
known John almost as long as she could remember. She had been rather in
awe of him as a little girl, and even to the time when he had in a
measure appropriated her, while she was yet in short frocks. And she
was not (no, certainly she was not) in love with anybody else. That
Harry Tolhurst's deep-set black eyes and dreamy gentleness of manner
should contrast themselves in her imagination with the ardent eyes and
vehement caresses of her betrothed was, she hoped, attributable mainly
to the fact that his picture of the Madonna haunted her so
persistently. In any case, she had no reason, save one that would
appear like a mere feminine caprice, to urge for sending John away at
the present moment. The most she could hope to do was to gain time, and
how could she answer for it that when she had been allowed to accustom
herself again to him she might not be quite ready and willing to be
married to him? Wilmer's heart, for one, was set upon the match; more
than ever perhaps since the wonderful episode of the great silver-mine
discovery. Moreover, ways of behaving that were disconcerting in a
lover might not matter so much in a husband. And as long as the
wedding-day was not actually fixed there would be time to reason with
herself and to bring herself ultimately into a more befitting frame of
mind. Very possibly she was too confused just now to make her thoughts
worth heeding seriously. All these are not, it may be said, arguments
of a very forcible kind, but they had the effect of keeping Portia
standing with her back against the table and her lover's arm round her
waist.</p>

<p>"Why, yes!" he said again; "there's nothing to stand in the way of
our being married straight off--as soon as you please. What's the use
of bothering about a trousseau? You'll never have anything prettier, to
my mind, than what you've got on now; and you shall buy all the best in
the London shops afterwards, if you've a mind to. My word, my pet, but
you'll show 'em the way! I was thinking how we'd show you off in the
Park this morning as I was coming up in the train from Plymouth. What
sort of a mount have you got--eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh! not bad!" Portia's interest was readily aroused in equine
matters, as John knew of old. "A big bay, with black points--very
nearly a thoroughbred. He's only a livery-stable horse, but Wilmer made
it a condition with the keeper that no one should ride him but me."</p>

<p>She did not say I, as, doubtless, she ought to have said; but
Portia's education, such as it was, had been finished in the bush, and
John was the last person in the world to notice the slip.</p>

<p>"We'll have something better than that for you before long," he
said, drawing her yet closer to his side. "Do you remember the little
chestnut filly I was going to break in for you? She's grown into the
prettiest mare you ever set your eyes on. A regular picture. I was
offered a couple of hundred for her down the day before we started by a
fellow who wanted to enter her for the Maiden Plate. She's worth a lot
more than that, though. Well, I've brought her home for you. She'll be
up in town this week. And jump!--good God, you should see her jump!
You've not had any cross--country riding, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No! but I should like it of all things," with a pretty flush of
anticipation rising in her cheeks. "There are no kangaroo in England,
are there?"</p>

<p>"None that I ever heard of, excepting at the Zoo. But fox-hunting's
about as good a sport as you can find. Wait till next season comes
round, and we've got the filly fit--you'll take the shine out of some
of them, I expect!"</p>

<p>"I remember the filly you mean quite well now," declared Portia. She
had been apparently musing deeply for the space of half a minute. "You
won the Oaks with her mother. Oh! by the bye" (with an air of awakened
interest), "what became of John, the trainer? Do you remember when his
wife was bitten by the snake, and you cut the place out with your
pocket--knife--and she died of something else, after all, poor woman,
the same year?"</p>

<p>Launched upon this retrospective tide, Portia had been looking into
a still recent past and had therefore failed to take note of the change
that came over her lover's face as she made mention of John, the
trainer. It was an ugly change, for it set an ugly expression upon it.
Whatever chain of associations the name might have suggested, the links
thereof had evidently chafed John Morrisson's soul in bygone days. He
did not speak for an instant, but his lips continued to work with the
tasting movement Portia knew so well. Like the men she had read of in
the novels, he was unconsciously gnawing his moustache. Quite
unsuspectingly, however, she continued to perform the feat known in
figurative French as that of putting her pieds dans le plat.</p>

<p>"And the daughter he was so proud of," she went on, ruminating; "the
one who had had such a 'rare bringing up'? I left the station before
she came up, and I never went back to it afterwards. Did she reach him
all right? He was so solitary after his wife died. I hope she is
keeping house for him now."</p>

<p>Still no answer! Portia looked round in surprise. John had released
her waist from the pressure of his encircling arm, and had actually
turned his back upon her. He was looking, or pretending to look in his
pocket-book for something that it was apparently imperative he would
find at this particular moment, and none other. In the process of
looking he had bent his head upon his chest, and Portia could see that
the blood had mounted to his temples in a warm red flame.</p>

<p>"You don't tell me!" she said, half vexed.</p>

<p>"Tell you what?" he answered, roughly; "you're asking me a lot of
questions about people I haven't come across for the Lord knows how
long. I've been up in the north of Queensland, you know; and let me
see, when I did stop at the station on one occasion, the
Willets--father and daughter--had left."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I'm sorry," said Portia, simply; "it was John Willet who
first taught me to ride, I believe, and he was never tired of talking
of his 'little lass' in the old country. We were about of an age--she
and I--he used to say."</p>

<p>All this time John was still continuing to turn over the contents of
his pocket-book, unheeding, to all appearance, of Portia's reflections:
she, therefore held her peace, and carried them on mutely. She was
thinking now of a time anterior even to the one when she had first
known him--a time at which she had been alternately fondled and scolded
by Emma, as she trotted bare-legged about the yard and garden that
surrounded the Paradinyah homestead. The station and all its
appurtenances had represented to to her in those days what the
duck-pond represented to Andersen's Ugly Duckling--a vast region, with
unlimited resources for the arousing of interest and amusement of every
imaginable description. She was made familiar with the draughting of
cattle, the shearing of sheep, and the branding of calves and horses,
almost as soon as she could run alone, and to her infant imagination
these were the events round which the whole world revolved. As a matter
of fact, her own world revolved around them; for what conception has a
six-year-old brain of other than a subjective universe? One of her
clearest recollections was of the first time she had ridden into the
township for the letters with John Willet, mounted on an old mare of
such amazing girth that her little feet dangling down from the saddle
had hardly reached to the animal's ribs. Portia was, however, a
practiced rider even at that time--for she would gallop her own pony
barebacked through the scrub, mounted for the most part &agrave;
califourchon like a Sioux chief. She had a miniature stock-whip, which
she learned to crack in quite a professional way. It was not until she
had come home for the holidays after the first year that she had been
sent, protesting and weeping, to a Melbourne boarding-school, that John
Morrisson, a newly--arrived inmate of the Paradinyah homestead, had
appeared on her horizon. It was he who had brought money into the
concern, and she had grown up with a kind of a vague belief that they
were all under great obligations to him, and that Wilmer would
inevitably have "gone broke" but for his timely intervention. Of her
own parents, dead within a twelve-month of each other, when she was
barely five years old, she retained but the most shadowy of
recollections. Her father, as she knew, had married young, and Wilmer
had been his only son. The mother had died at the birth. After
five--and-twenty years of a widower's existence, spent in roving about
the world, he had drifted to Australia, purchased a bush property for
his son, and finally contracted a second marriage in Melbourne, with a
girl some thirty years younger than himself. Portia knew little about
her mother. She had gathered, however, that she was beautiful, though
of insignificant extraction--not "adelig," as Emma said, with a pitying
shake of the head. All her own understanding of family ties, all that
she had ever known of family love and tenderness and authority, she
owed to her step-brother and his wife. Enveloped in a moral atmosphere
at once bracing and tender from her childhood upwards, it had never
occurred to her to regret that she was not only orphaned, but
sisterless and brotherless as well, in the ordinary acceptation of the
phrase. She never doubted that she had had as large share of love and
care as falls to the lot of the most loved and looked-after of
children, and that Wilmer and Emma only "wanted her good." This
conviction, that she held as firmly as--more firmly maybe than--the
Articles set forth in the Creed in her Church of England Prayer-book,
might have explained in a great measure the attitude of passive
acceptance of her fate that had marked her engagement with John
Morrisson. Even the request she had proffered to be allowed to wait
until she was of age before the marriage was consummated was the result
of an inspiration so bold and unprecedented that she was unable to
account for it to herself. Thinking over the past this morning, with
the future in the guise of her returned lover standing mysteriously
taciturn by her side, Portia was thunderstruck to find that the vision
of the Madonna's effigy seemed to blend itself with those distant
scenes, almost as determinedly as it had blended itself with the
impression of vague terror provoked awhile ago by John's suggestion
that she should marry him without delay. What magic made her
perpetually embroil in her mind matters so wide apart in reality! Why,
out of all the pictures she had seen that morning, did this one alone
rise like a spectre before her, and spread its blurred hues over
whatever passage in her life she might happen to pass under review? In
olden times people would have declared there was some deadly witchcraft
in the painting. Why did the Madonna's eyes, above all, haunt her as
though they had some special message for her that none else in the
world could understand? These thoughts, begot, as she would fain have
believed, "of nothing but vain fantasy," continued nevertheless to run
riot through her brain, until she was suddenly brought back (like a
witness in the Supreme Court) to the "facts of the case" by John's
triumphant voice.</p>

<p>"By George! I thought I'd lost it. See here, my pet, what I've
brought you from the mine--quite close to it, that's to say. No--you
shan't have it till you've given me a kiss first."</p>

<p>He had seated himself quite upon the edge of the table by this time,
and was holding her close to his knee like a child. She kissed him
timidly on the cheek, in such evident terror of fresh demonstrations on
his part that he forbore for once to press his advantage.</p>

<p>"You know you're going to be a rich woman, don't you, dear? I expect
you'll have money enough to get as many gimcracks as you've a fancy
for. Still, here's a thing I want you to wear for my sake. It's sui
generis--it is. I found it myself up in Queensland, and I got it set
round with diamonds in Sydney. I guess its about the right size for
you--ain't it?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he unfolded, from a triple wrapping of soft
tissue-paper, a ring composed of a gold band upon which was mounted a
magnificent opal encircled by a setting of splendidly flashing
brilliants. This he passed over the third finger of Portia's left
hand--holding it aloft as he did so to admire the effect.</p>

<p>"Isn't it a stunner?" he said. "But look here, darling, let me just
twist it round--this way--to make believe it's your wedding-ring, and
we're man and wife!"</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried Portia, hastily withdrawing her hand, "it's much too
pretty as it is. I love opals; I wonder what fool it was who first
thought of calling them unlucky!"</p>

<p>"Unlucky, are they? By Jove, if I thought there were anything in it,
I'd throw the ring out of the window this moment."</p>

<p>"Not for worlds!" she protested, closing her fingers tightly upon
her treasure, while John seized her hand and feigned to wrench them
open. Finally and matter was compromised by her allowing him to kiss
them all in succession, a pastime which was only put an end to by the
timely intervention of the gong clanging forth its summons to
lunch.</p>

<h3>Chapter V</h3>

<p>THE breakfast-room in the Jameses' Kensington abode wherein they
chose to take their mid-day meal, opened upon a conservatory that
Wilmer had consecrated entirely to Australian trees and flowers. The
half acrid, half aromatic, perfume of blue gum and peppermint saplings,
that by-and--by would shoot up like Jack's beanstalk until nothing
short of a cathedral dome would have sufficed to shelter their
exuberant growth, was wafted therefrom into the apartment. Miniature
Murray pines, with their rich green bomb&eacute; surfaces, fern-trees
from nia, set in humid moss-grown beds, over which an artificial
water-course trickled perpetually--more wonderful still, flowering
specimens of the scarlet waratah and infoliated grass-tree blossom from
Mount Wellington, set against a background of brilliantly--flowering
creepers from New South Wales, made of this conservatory a place for an
exiled Australian to dream in. John was loud in his praises of it, as
he sat down to the exquisitely appointed table facing his betrothed,
while Mr. and Mrs. James formally installed themselves at the head and
foot of the same.</p>

<p>To hold up the assembled party to the eyes of English readers as
thoroughly typical Australians, would be as unjust a proceeding as was
that of Dumas p&egrave;re when he declared that all the inhabitants of
Antwerp were roux because he had encountered two red headed girls on
his way to the hotel. No one is thoroughly typical unless he be a
savage or a peasant. Portia and her relatives retained their own
underlying individualities none the less that they had been influenced
in their outward bearing and modes of expressing themselves by a long
sojourn in the back blocks of Victoria, in daily contact with all sorts
and conditions of men--broken-down gentlemen, English yokels,
bush-hands, and the like. After all, the moulding of character by
outward influences alone is not a work to be achieved in one
generation, or what would become of the theory of heredity, upon which
everything is supposed to depend, more or less, in our present
scientific age? If these people strike the English reader, therefore,
as differing in certain respects from those he is accustomed to meet in
his daily walk through life, let him remember that the differences
which will strike him most are the merely superficial ones resulting
from an occasional departure from the conventional rules of speech and
behaviour that guide his own outward conduct, and that in all the main
essentials they are, au fond, neither more like him nor more unlike him
than though chance had willed that they should be born and brought up
on the selfsame patch of earth as himself. A difference in the
vocabulary of the native-born Australian, or long resident in
Australia, of the not too highly-educated order, as well as a
difference in his tone of voice and enunciation, from that of a person
belonging to a corresponding class in England, is one of those facts,
however, which "nobody can deny." I am not going to enter in this
connection upon a disquisition respecting the relative merits of what
Mrs. James would have called "h&ouml;fisch" English, and the English
that has been coined out of entirely new conditions by pioneers and
backwoodsmen. Suffice it to say, there is a difference, and Portia was
never more sensible of it than when she returned, as on the present
occasion, from moving among a London society crowd, into the
Anglo-Australian social atmosphere of the Kensington house. Her
sister-in--law's unconscious colonial slang, grafted on to a German
mode of speech and pronunciation which she had never been able to
forswear, struck her as being funnier than she had ever been aware of
before. And when she heard Emma gravely accusing her London visitors of
"pooting on zide," she was fain to invent a reason, which had not the
remotest connection with the actual one, for breaking into an unadvised
laugh.</p>

<p>"Might fancy yourself on the Plains again, mightn't you?" said
Wilmer to his guest, as they sat down to lunch--he had placed him just
where John could obtain a full view of the most flourishing of the
eucalyptus saplings through the artistically-opened Liberty
porti&egrave;res that closed the conservatory--"always barring the
mosquitoes and the flies."</p>

<p>Wilmer James was what is called dapper in figure; light of build,
though of a fair middle height. He was clean-shaven, and not unlike a
squireen as represented in some delicately tinted engraving of seventy
or eighty years back. His morning suit had something of a sporting cut,
and he wore a monocle in his left eye. This, however, was a habit of
very recent adoption, and practice had not as yet made him perfect in
it. His hat had never been known to sit otherwise than a little tilted
to one side on his head. He had been a well-known figure upon
Australian race-courses for years, and none would have been more
astonished than the people with whom he had horsey relations (of a
strictly honourable kind as far as he himself was concerned) had they
known to what extravagant lengths he would go when an opportunity for
backing his judgment--in the purchase of some pseudo "old master"--came
in his way. If humanity is not typical, as we have just essayed to
show, neither is it consistent. The most adverse tastes are frequently
to be met with in one and the same individual. There seems, it is true,
to be little apparent connection between a love of horse-racing and a
passion for Claudes and Ruysdaels, which last, to be properly followed
up, would necessitate a long and arduous apprenticeship in old-world
picture--galleries and museums. And yet it is a fact that Wilmer James
would spend hundreds and thousands upon a sombre-tinted canvas, of
which the original hues had become merged into blackened greens and
blues, provided it bore either of the above-mentioned great names. What
was more, he thoroughly believed that he had provided himself with an
inexhaustible fund of artistic pleasure when he succeeded in acquiring
one or other of these mendacious works of art, to which the certainty
that only he himself and a few of the initiated were capable of tasting
it gave an added savour. This id&eacute;e fixe, however, as it
certainly was, had the advantage of being an entirely harmless one,
and, excepting for the fact that he became a "mark" for
picture-dealers, who occasionally "let him in" to an enormous extent,
was in no way detrimental to the piece of mind of his family. It is to
be wished as much might be said of the weaknesses of every nouveau
riche who has become "dammed to Fame" in latter years.</p>

<p>Though John admired his host's Australian gully, as Wilmer called
his conservatory, as unreservedly as could be wished, he was still
better pleased to let his eyes rest upon the face just opposite him,
that occasionally intercepted his view of the eucalyptus tree. Portia
was conscious of his glance, and was feeling sadly ill at ease under
it. As with his first greeting of her, so now in the air of
proprietorship with which he publicly regarded her, there was something
that made her long to "turn and flee." It is Sir Walter Scott, I think,
who has condensed into a single sentence words of so much purport, when
he speaks in one of his romances of two lovers restored to each other,
who manifest their joy by all the "endearments that mutual love at once
suggests and sanctions." Where such manifestations spring from a
one-sided sentiment, as was the case, I fear, with John and Portia,
they are apt to be more terrifying than reassuring to the non--or
wrong-sided one. Portia was grateful when Wilmer created a diversion by
asking John what he thought of the English salmon (served with a
wonderful Pistachio sauce) that he was engaged in eating.</p>

<p>"It beats the Murray perch, old man, doesn't it?" he said. "Here's
to your return to the old country. Thomas, fill Mr. Morrisson's glass
with champagne. And Miss Portia's too! Emma, are you ready?"</p>

<p>The toast was acknowledged by a shake of the hands on the part of
the recipient with all the company in turn.</p>

<p>"And now I'll propose the Little Wonder," he said gravely; "and long
may she prosper!"</p>

<p>The "Little Wonder" thus caressingly alluded to was the huge silver
mine twelve thousand miles away, which, night and day, in heat and
smoke, and steam and turmoil, yielded up the ore that was moulded into
the mighty ingots, that, in their turn, became metamorphosed into the
shining coins, which, to crown the sequence, filled the Kensington
mansion with exotic trees and old masters, at the will and pleasure of
its master.</p>

<p>"I'll have to go and look after things a bit next year, I expect,"
continued John, after the second toast had been duly drunk. "The
manager's all right enough; but there's no eye like the master's."</p>

<p>"How'll that suit you, Portia, eh?" asked her brother, looking
across at her with a smile, which was suddenly contracted by the
unexpected falling out of his monocle. "She's dead nuts on London," he
added, addressing himself to John, as he picked it up and readjusted it
methodically in his left eye. "It was getting about time you came to
look after her, I tell you. Why, last night she was waltzing up to all
hours. Emma couldn't drag her away; and this morning she was off all by
herself, if you'll believe me, before anybody in the house was up. Come
now, Miss, give us a full, true, unvarnished account of your
proceedings since breakfast. Why, she's blushing--upon my soul, she's
blushing! Things look promising for you, John. You'd better
crossexamine her on the spot, if you'll take my advice."</p>

<p>"Why, you know where I went; and so does Emma," protested Portia,
feeling it impossible to be playful under her brother's inopportune
badinage; with the consciousness, too, that her cheeks were burning
visibly, and that there was something more oppressive than ever in her
lover's way of looking at her. "I went to the Academy. I always said I
would go some morning as soon as the doors were opened."</p>

<p>"And you did gif her your gatalogue, Wilmer," put in his wife,
reproachfully, whether with the intention of coming to Portia's rescue,
or of reminding her husband that he had been aider and abettor in the
transaction, was not clear.</p>

<p>"So I did; but I never thought she'd make use of it."</p>

<p>"Well! and who did you meet? How many of your beaux of last night
did you drop across?"</p>

<p>"None," said Portia, immensely relieved to be saved from the
necessity of telling a lie--an accomplishment in which she was
miserably deficient; "but I wonder why you selected those particular
pictures you marked in the catalogue. I saw ever so many I liked much
better."</p>

<p>The stratagem succeeded. She had carried the war into the enemy's
camp. Wilmer, who had been actuated by no other aim than that of making
her feel as uncomfortable as possible, found it incumbent upon him now
to defend his self-assumed claim to the character of art-critic without
delay.</p>

<p>"What do you know about pictures? There's a lot of modern rubbish I
wouldn't give a sixpence for. The ones I marked had an old master touch
about them that made them a little better than the rest; but I wouldn't
have 'em in my collection at any price. We'll take a turn through the
gallery when lunch is over, if John's agreeable."</p>

<p>"Just as you like," assented John; "but I don't pretend to know
anything about pictures. Living pictures are the only ones to my
taste."</p>

<p>He looked at Portia as he said this, but encountered no responsive
glance, and the conversation took a more general turn. Everyone had
something to ask about John's experiences on his homeward voyage. Mrs.
James, who was wielding a huge feather-fan of barbaric magnificence,
was interested to learn whether Mrs. So-and-so or Miss So-and-so had
been considered the best-dressed woman on board. Portia wanted to know
what John had thought of the earthly paradise of Ceylon, with its
brilliant fringe of palm--trees standing like sentinels clad in green
uniforms upon the surf-wreathed yellow coast. Also--and this was a
melting reminiscence--whether he had seen among the little bronze-hued
boys who dived under the ship at Aden, to the chorus of "&agrave; la
mer" and "ab a dibe," the especial one whose leg had been bitten off by
a shark. Wilmer asked to be informed as to the best day's run they had
made, whether John had been lucky in the sweeps, and whether there had
been much high play on board, When he had replied categorically to all
these questions the party adjourned to the conservatory, where Mrs.
James selected a cabbage-tree palm as the most becoming background for
her gown of peacock-blue, and Wilmer offered his friend a cigar, with
the remark, "and I'd just like to know what you think of it
by--and-bye." A footman, in blue and silver--Mrs. James would have had
him bewigged and bepowdered as well, if she had only had carte blanche
in the matter--brought in coffee and liqueurs (this custom had only
been in vogue since the Jameses' return from the Continent), and while
the men smoked and talked, and the words "coupons, shares, Little
Wonder, mining-plant, lode, and pyrites," frequently recurring, made
their conversation as unintelligible as it was uninteresting to their
feminine hearers, Mrs. James leant back in her lounge of gilt
wickerwork, against a gold-embroidered cushion, and Portia gave herself
up to a day-dream under the shadow of a spreading fern-tree. From her
seat she could see through the curtain-wreathed archway into the room
they had just left, where the silver-blue footman was engaged in
removing the dishes. Only yesterday she had taken an almost childish
pleasure in the reflection that there were so many lovely things to
look at now in her daily surroundings. Yesterday it would have been
entertainment enough only to sit under the ferns, with a book upon her
lap and the vista of the table, like a scene upon the stage, with its
carpet of exquisite flowers, its fruit-laden dishes, and crystal
glasses to meet her eyes when she raised them abstractedly from the
page. To-day her horizon seemed to be all dulled and contracted.
Everyone about her--John with his heated face, Wilmer with his still
unfamiliar monocle, even poor, good Emma, in her peacock gown--no
longer appeared the same. Life this morning, as she drove down
Piccadilly in the dimly--looming fog, had seemed so full of wondrous
possibilities. Now, it seemed to be all narrowed down to the prospect
of perpetual imprisonment in a gorgeous mansion such as this, with a
husband in whom there was nothing to awaken the vague rapture that love
and marriage, as she would fain have imagined them, should have
inspired.</p>

<p>"What do I want, after all?" she reflected; "and why has my world
been out of joint since I came back from the Academy? Can it be that my
only objection to John is that he is not new enough for me? Did I want
marriage, if I had been free to marry, to mean some wonderful change
that would have lifted me out of all my old associations? And in what
direction, and to what end! Why should one always imagine there must be
something in the unknown so infinitely beyond what we have within our
reach?"</p>

<p>It was a perplexing question, and one that has been turned over in
thousands of brains many thousands of times, since the day when
slowly--developing man evolved his first ideal. Portia was spared the
necessity of seeking for a solution of it at the present moment (though
it was sure to haunt her later) by a general move towards the
picture-gallery, whither her brother, triumphantly maintaining the
monocle tightly screwed in his left eye, now led the way.</p>

<p>A person professing to be a connoisseur, and finding himself in
presence of an unknown collection of works of art, with no real
knowledge to fall back upon, presents a pitiable spectacle enough. In
the present instance, however, there was no exposure of the kind to be
feared. In the first place, because Wilmer, in his na&iuml;ve and
stupendous ignorance, was entirely of good faith, and took himself in
even where he failed to take in others; and in the second, because
nobody in the party that now accompanied him cared a rush for his
Claudes, or for the value that he might think fit to set upon them.
John eyed with scant respect the dimensions of the gallery, lighted
from above, and in the eighteen or twenty sombre paintings that lined
its opposite walls saw nothing that called forth his interest or
admiration.</p>

<p>"But just wait till I show you this, old man!" Wilmer said
enthusiastically, leading him up to an easel standing apart, upon which
was displayed the coppery-skied Claude that Portia had so graphically
but ungrammatically described to Harry.</p>

<p>"How's that for Hi! eh?"</p>

<p>"A landscape?" said John, dubiously, feeling that it was absolutely
necessary he should say something.</p>

<p>"A landscape! why, what else would you take it for? You wouldn't
suppose I gave a cool" (here he whispered something in his partner's
ear that made John lift his eyebrows high with surprise). "I did,
indeed; and a wonderful bargain I consider it. Look at the colour in
that sky; look at the sunset glow on those branches; look at the
reflection in that water--just look at it, I say! Some people wouldn't
have known it for a Claude; but I spotted it at once."</p>

<p>"I suppose there are points about it," began John, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Such bease!" murmured Mrs. James, with emphasis, after she had made
an elaborate feint of examining it more closely.</p>

<p>"It's peaceful enough," assented John, catching at the phrase, "if
that's all you want in a picture; but I'd look a long time at two
hundred and eighty pounds before I spent it on that."</p>

<p>"There's the picture I dislike the least," said Portia, and as she
moved away towards what happened to be the only genuine Ruysdael in the
collection, representing the corner of a dark forest with a glade of
surpassing softness in the foreground, John came up and stood by her
side.</p>

<p>"I haven't got any eyes for pictures to-day," he said; "I've only
one thing in my head, and I mean to say it straight out. Wilmer, here,
and Mrs. James will be my witnesses. Will you, Portia James, put your
hand in mine and say, 'This day week, or this day fortnight, or this
day month'--not a day later than a month, though--'I will take you,
John Morrisson, for my wedded husband.' Say it now," he said eagerly,
as his lips pressed themselves together in their accustomed tasting
mould. "Make her say it, Wilmer, here in your presence and Emma's"--he
had referred to his friend's wife by her Christian name in the pure
agitation of the moment, or perhaps he was thinking of her only in her
relation to her husband as his natural ally; "it's been pretty rough
upon me to have to wait for my happiness all these years. But you can't
say I haven't kept my word. There's our engagement ring on her
finger,"--he continued, drawing Portia's cold and unresisting hand into
his own, and crushing it with unconscious force as he turned to
Wilmer--"the new one."</p>

<p>Now, whether it was the difficulty of maintaining the monocle
exactly in its proper place, or a result of the effort to look at the
ring with the unoccupied and available eye in the meantime, it is
impossible to say. But it is certain that the look which Portia
directed at her brother, the mute appeal written in those speaking eyes
of hers, was entirely lost upon him, otherwise this chapter of her
life's history might never have been written. As it was, there was
nothing in the fact of John's having had recourse to him, to urge his
betrothed to a speedy marriage, that struck Wilmer as being in the
least extraordinary or irregular. Without the smallest doubt in his own
mind that the match was all that was desirable for his sister, and
quite convinced that she was entirely content with it herself, he
thought he had noticed a tendency on her part to prolong her lover's
time of probation beyond all reasonable limits. It must be remembered
that though Portia was, in point of fact, a child at the time when she
had dutifully promised to marry John Morrisson, all the years that had
elapsed since then were counted as years that he had accorded her
magnanimously and generously. It was time that this state of things
should come to an end. It was only, Wilmer reflected, in the days of
the patriarchs that a man could afford to throw away seven-year periods
of his life in dangling after one woman. As regarded his own marriage,
he had come, and seen, and conquered the unresisting Emma all in five
weeks. He therefore adjusted his monocle with a fine stage effect, and
said, magisterially, "Right you are, old man! Now, Portia, my dear,
there's been shilly-shallying and dilly-dallying enough. When are you
going to let our friend John lead you to the altar? One week"--he
raised his hand as though he were conducting a sale, and brought it
down with an imaginary auctioneer's hammer between each pause--"two
weeks, three weeks--going, going, three weeks--four weeks, going--what,
not gone? Oh, that'll never do; four weeks, four weeks--going--five
weeks--gone! You made a sign--that meant gone! What! you didn't know
it? Nonsense--anyhow it's a settled matter. Come, Emma, kiss her--kiss
them both, and leave them to settle the matter between themselves."</p>

<h3>Chapter VI</h3>

<p>"IS Mrs. Morris at home?--and if so, will you give her my card, and
ask her whether I may say a few words to her?"</p>

<p>It was Harry Tolhurst who spoke, proffering his soft-voiced request
to a woman with the hard exterior of a sixth-rate lodging-house-keeper,
standing in an aggressive "What's your business?" attitude just within
the narrow entrance of a dingy-looking three-storey house in a
by-street off Notting Hill. Harry looked more like the "Chevalier de la
Triste Figure" than ever; he wore a mourning-band round his tall hat,
and carried a pair of black gloves in his hand.</p>

<p>"She's in," the woman said, in nasally-suspicious tones, as she took
the card he handed her, with a manner as ungracious as her accents.</p>

<p>"Oh; then I'll wait inside a moment, if you'll allow me," he said
courteously.</p>

<p>It was necessary to take the initiative, for the woman had made a
gesture as of shutting the half-opened house-door in his face. Now,
however, she backed before him sullenly, and, opening the door of a
musty room upon the corridor--of the flyblown-paper-flowers and
bead-basket order--informed him grudgingly that she would carry his
card "hupstairs."</p>

<p>He laid his hat and gloves upon the dusty table, and remained
standing as he awaited Mrs. Morris's advent. The room was as repellent
as its mistress; the undusted glazed leather arm-chair, with its
antimacassars in torn crochet-work slipping from the back and arms,
seemed the most uninviting resting-place in the world. There was a
green-gauze-enshrined, ill-looking mirror on the mantlepiece that, like
the mirrors shipped off to remote colonial townships (where mechanical
as well as moral failures are not unfrequently to be encountered),
distorted all that it reflected.</p>

<p>"What pains people are at to make their lives ugly," Harry thought
within himself; it is "curious that man should be the most inartistic
animal in existence! There is a shaping of the means to the end in the
construction of every other living creature that spins, or weaves, or
builds itself a habitation, out of which harmony and beauty spring, as
a matter of course. It is only human life that encumbers itself with
hideous and useless superfluities."</p>

<p>It might be imagined from the tenor of the foregoing reflection that
Harry's mind was like that of the Psalmist, to wit, a "kingdom" wherein
none but decorous subjects were given their liberty of action--or, in
other words, that his reflections were always of a purely abstract or
professional nature. This, however, was far from being the case,
especially this morning, when he had so many closer interests to think
of, that if the crude cheerlessness of the room had not literally
jumped, in French parlance, at his eyes, he would hardly have known
whether he was standing there or in the equally cheerless passage
outside.</p>

<p>So many objects of interest, yet room for such an absorbing one
besides! Ever since he had led Portia from picture to picture in the
rooms of Burlington House to take final and formal leave of her among
the unheeding crowd in Piccadilly, her sweet eyes had intercepted
themselves between himself and his work. Sometimes he thought of her as
Undine, endowed with an embryonic soul, that was still awaiting the
influence that was to transform it into a steadfast one. Sometimes as
Una, walking in her virginal innocence through a world beset by beasts
of prey in human guise. He was convinced that she was entirely sincere,
intelligent, confiding, and joy-loving. What a mind hers would be to
open! From the little he had seen of her surroundings, he was sure that
she must have been brought up in intellectual darkness, and doubtless,
spiritual darkness too. Yet how easy it was to arouse her interest and
sympathy in subjects that the majority of the women he talked to cared
nothing about. Singularly enough, as he owned to himself, Portia was in
no wise his ideal. His ideal, whom he had never as yet found incarnate,
was a dreamy-eyed woman of a mystic bias, heroic and religious, and
world-renouncing. That Portia should have taken such a hold upon his
imagination, notwithstanding her complete divergence from this type,
only seemed to him a stronger proof of the reality of the sentiment she
had inspired in him, as the fact that nations continue to believe in
revealed religions, despite the miracles and contradictions that must
be accepted along with them, seems in the eyes of religious votaries a
proof of the Heaven-inspired reality of the same. It was some three or
four weeks now since that happy morning at the Academy when Harry had
been rewarded for a week's attente by having Portia to himself for a
whole two hours for the first time since he had met her. He had haunted
the Burlington House approaches vainly since; had lost hours in the
Park at the fashionable moments of the day; had grudged the three days'
absence entailed by the funeral of a distant relative, who had left him
a little sum of money; and had finally invented a pretext for ringing
at the door of the Kensington mansion, "The family was in Paris," the
man had replied, "but they were expected back shortly." And Harry had
actually found himself pondering uneasily upon the motives that could
have taken Portia and her belongings to Paris in the full flush of the
season, when everybody with money is sure to be entertaining or being
entertained, the first being often only a preliminary means of ensuring
the second. There was, then, Portia's absence to ponder over, and this
was a subject that, latent or active, was seldom out of his mind; and
there was the immediate execution of some artistic work to undertake,
which formed, indeed, the object of his visit to the dingy
lodging-house this morning. Mrs. Morris was the only person who could
help him in the latter respect, and he waited with some impatience for
her to descend from the regions the landlady had designated as
"hupstairs."</p>

<p>The door was opened at last, and a young woman with a pale face and
black hair, carrying a baby in her arms, came into the room. She had
large dark eyes, that seemed to possess a naturally dramatic intensity
of expression--or was it that some brooding care sate behind them?--and
her dress betokened an utter carelessness as to the impression she
produced upon her callers. It consisted of a collarless outdoor jacket,
that looked as though it might have been costly and handsome before it
had done duty for house and nursing attire, and a limp black skirt that
dragged the floor all round her as she walked. The child upon her arm
in no way resembled her. Its eyes were of a curious thick shade of
blue, that had an air of being never fully pierced by the light, and
the bright auburn hair stuck out in scant locks from the large head.
Harry held out his hand to the mother as to an old acquaintance, and
placed one of the shiny leather chairs in readiness for her. She
accepted it with a murmured "Thank you," and seated herself listlessly,
with the baby held against her breast.</p>

<p>"I've had some trouble in finding you out," Harry told her. "I went
to your old quarters first; you don't seem to have gained by the
change."</p>

<p>"It's cheaper here," she replied indifferently. "Well, Mr. Tolhurst,
I said 'No' last time you came, you remember; but I'll say 'Yes' now,
if you want me."</p>

<p>"I do want you," Harry replied; he could not refrain from a feeling
of pity for the evident desolation he found her in. "I'll give you
double what you had before, but I don't want the baby this time."</p>

<p>"Not the baby!" Her face fell. "I must bring him along anyhow. I
couldn't come without him."</p>

<p>"Bring him by all means. There's a woman at the studio who'll look
after him. I should like you to come to-morrow if you will, nine
o'clock sharp; and"--he hesitated, as though in fear of offending
her--"if you want a little advance, I wish you would tell me."</p>

<p>The kindly, cordial manner in which these words were uttered wrought
an instant change in her face. Her mouth lost its weary, half-defiant
expression, and trembled into pathetic curves, like that of a child on
the point of crying. The tears gathered slowly in her eyes, veiling the
sad expression of strained expectation they had worn hitherto. She
placed her hand hastily before them, while Harry said, in a voice of
genuine pity:</p>

<p>"I wish you would let me help you. You would be doing me the
greatest favor if you would. Are you in want of money? Have you not
heard lately from your husband? You were expecting him from America the
last time I saw you. He hasn't turned up, then, yet? But he has written
to you, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No! oh no! not for ever so long!" The words were scarcely audible
for the sobs--the uncontrollable outburst of some long pent-up
grief--that shook her frame as she spoke.</p>

<p>"And have you no friends here, none of his or yours, that can help
you?"</p>

<p>"Not one I could go to," she said, with her handkerchief pressed to
her face. She was weeping more quietly now. If the jilted hero of
Locksley Hall declared, with some reason, that woman's emotions are
less poignant than men's, he might have added that it was because, in
the majority of cases, they know the relief of having "a good cry," an
outlet debarred, for the most part, to the sterner sex.</p>

<p>"That is a pity," Harry said gravely; "but you mustn't lose heart so
soon. If you want to earn money, I can find you plenty of work as a
model. The Madonna was the best advertisement you could have.
Meanwhile, you should move out of these wretched rooms. I will give you
the address of some better ones to-morrow--not too dear; and then we
must have proper inquiries made about your husband. I suppose you have
written always?"</p>

<p>"Written, and written, and written," she said despairingly. "What's
the use if he doesn't choose to answer?"</p>

<p>A vengeful look flashed across her face; a look that would have
better befitted the outraged Queen Athalie than the wistful-eyed
Madonna in the Academy. Harry noticed it, and said softly:</p>

<p>"If I am to help you, Mrs. Morris, I think you should trust me
altogether. It is very painful for you to speak about, I know; but I
don't see how we can set to work till we know what ground we are
treading on. Have you any reason to think your husband has deserted
you?"</p>

<p>He said it gently, but firmly, looking down upon her compassionately
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"I haven't any reason," she said despondently; "but I do think so
sometimes, all the same."</p>

<p>Her eyes, still moist with tears, were looking up into his as though
they were pleading for reassurance against her own worst terrors. Harry
could see now how grief had worn and lined her face in the past few
weeks. It was a young face, hardly more than a girl's; but motherhood
and heartbreak had set their seal upon it, and the girl's look could
never more return into it. The dark, almost Oriental eyes and clear
pallor of the skin had been the special qualities that had made Harry
seek her out as a model for her study of the Madonna and Child as she
stood in the midst of a crowd, waiting for an omnibus at Oxford Circus.
The vehicles seemed to fill in rapid succession, and each time she made
an attempt to push her way forward, with her infant in her arms, he had
seen her pushed back by some rudely elbowing aspirant. He had stood
watching the scene for a few moments before he came to her assistance.
It was difficult to say to what class she belonged. The face was
undeniably handsome, the features, regular and well-formed; yet the
subtle, indefinable suggestion conveyed in the lines of the mouth was
rather of Bank Holiday than of Lady's Mile associations. The figure was
youthful and of middle height; the dress--an artist, accustomed to
study hues and textures almost daily, is undesignedly an appraiser of
dress--was rich in material, and well-made, but bore the appearance of
having been lived and travelled and slept in. Harry had taken in all
these details before coming to her aid. As the next Bayswater omnibus
rolled up, the evening being a rarely beautiful one, such as a
capricious clerk of the weather will sometimes ordain in the middle of
February, he helped her to mount upon the top, and, with his Madonna
still in his mind, seated himself beside her upon a double seat in
front that they had all to themselves.</p>

<p>He did not know Portia in those days, but he was not moved by any
other motive than a professional one in his accosting the young woman
he had just encountered. He spoke to her as it is allowable to speak to
a neighbour on the top of a 'bus. (What a curious record some of these
fragmentary conversations would make, to be sure! What transient
sympathies, that never have scope to ripen, they might betray! What
first-chapters of three--volume popular novels they might furnish!) He
asked her where she wished to be set down, and discovered by a curious
coincidence that it was in the self-same spot as himself; looked with
interest at her sleeping baby, and addressed her the familiar questions
that chance acquaintances on an omnibus will also occasionally ask each
other: questions that he felt intuitively would not be resented by her,
though he would have hesitated to frame them in most cases. "Was that
her own baby?" and "Did she live in London?" and "Was her husband with
her?" and ainsi de suite.</p>

<p>He did not ask these questions categorically; they found their
raison d'&ecirc;tre after the prescribed remarks had been "passed"--as
Mrs. Morris herself would have called it, according to omnibus
etiquette--between her and himself. The fineness of the evening, the
astonishing mildness of the atmosphere for February, the redness of the
sunset, the probability of a change on the morrow, the snowstorm of the
preceding Sunday--all the old stock-subjects received their full and
rightful share of consideration before more intimate topics were
discussed. Harry found that his companion's voice corresponded to the
Bank Holiday contour of her mouth. But if the intonation did not speak
of Newnham or Girton, the timbre was pleasant and unaffected. He
learned that she had been to boarding-school at Brixton, but had
travelled much since. She had been to Australia, and had stopped at the
Cape on her way, and now she had just come from America, whence she was
daily expecting her husband to join her. She had come in advance to see
an old aunt in Clapham, who had brought her up, and who had telegraphed
for her; but when she reached England she learned that the aunt had
died, and now she found herself all alone in London with her child.</p>

<p>And then Harry had returned the confidence by telling her, in his
soft, refined voice, as much as it was necessary that she should know
about himself, before leading up to the question he had it in his mind
to ask her. He explained that he painted pictures for his living, and
that it was very hard work, but that it was the only work he cared
about doing. He entered into the difficulty of finding faces to paint
that corresponded to the ideas ("ideals" he abstained from saying, lest
she should fail to understand him) that he had in his mind, and told
her how much he had been struck by the fitness of her face for the
study of a Madonna he was contemplating. She had looked half-pleased
and half-frightened, and had said, "Oh my! what, me a Madonna! Go away
with you!" But he had insisted, and had assured her that he would be
more grateful than he could say if she would let him put her into his
picture, and her baby too; adding that if she liked to earn a little
extra money to spend, the obligation of sitting still with her child on
her lap for eighteenpence an hour was a comparatively easy way of doing
so. "And you'll put him in the picture, too?" she had asked, raising
the child to her face and covering him with kisses. "That's what I
think the most of."</p>

<p>"Of course; why, we couldn't do without him. Let me look at his
face, will you, a moment?"</p>

<p>She turned it round to him with all a mother's pride, pushing the
cap back from the baby's forehead with eager fingers. Harry gazed
curiously into the small face, which Time's fingers had not as yet
shaped into any definite mould. "He isn't like you," he said, in an
unconsciously regretful tone.</p>

<p>"No; he takes after his father." It was impossible to say whether
she was glad or grieved at the resemblance.</p>

<p>"He has fine eyes, though," said Harry; he could see that she was
greedy of admiration for her first-born; "are they like his father's
too?"</p>

<p>"The very image of them," with a sigh; "and you should see how he
twists them about when he's looking after me. It's that pitiful, as if
he was saying, 'What 'ud become of me without my mother, I'd like to
know?'"</p>

<p>Harry remembered that his inspection of the baby on this occasion
had led to his treating his subject in a more novel and unconventional
way than he had originally intended. People were beginning now to speak
of his picture; his rendering of the eyes of the Infant, especially
were made an occasion for the exercise of polemics in the art, and
would-be art, world, that had brought it into prompt notice. Some
critics saw in these eyes only the mechanical mediums for the
transmission of light without comprehension that the great French
painter Deschamps sets in the heads of his realistic infants of a
tender age. Others declared that what the former critics called a
vacant gaze was in reality an expression charged with a mystic
significance, and that "illimitable possibilities" lay behind the
somewhat opaque blue orbs with the glareous whites. Two camps were
formed, and the Daily Telegraph made a fresh harvest out of letters
headed "Modern Treatment of Religious Subjects," to which Mrs.
Nicklebys innumerable contributed.</p>

<p>The picture had been begun in February, and Harry had worked at it
unceasingly until it was sufficiently advanced to be sent to the
Academy, under the appellation of "A Study for the Virgin and Child."
He had not exchanged much conversation with his model, being loth to
lose the benefit of an abstracted, half-wisful expression that she wore
when she was silent. He thought of all these things now, as she looked
up towards him for help and counsel. Perhaps, if the vision of Portia
had not been so ever-present in his mind, it would have been hard to
resist answering the appeal by one of those demonstrations of sympathy
that a man is so prompted to make when a young and pretty woman seeks
consolation at his hands. But, besides the fact that he cherished
Portia's image so closely, Harry had strongly-rooted principles as
regarded the treatment of his models. He therefore replied to the
glance by the formal words, "I assure you, my dear Mrs. Morris, I am
most anxious to do everything in my power to help you. At nine o'clock
to--morrow, then--and I shall hope to be able to advise you about your
course then. I have an appointment to keep now; but if you will think
over the matter to-day, and tell me as much of your case as may be
necessary to enable me to help you, I will see what can be done, I
promise you;" and without waiting for her to thank him he departed.</p>

<h3>Chapter VII</h3>

<p>PORTIA'S wedding-day was fast approaching. The last free Wednesday
had come and gone, and now she was clinging to the last Thursday in the
week that she might still call her own. Although the whole party had
made a hurried visit to Paris, where alone, from Mrs. James's point of
view, "a going-away bonnet" worthy of the occasion could be found; and
though the chestnut filly had arrived from Plymouth and had proved
herself all and more than a daughter of the winner of the Oaks might be
expected to be, there were yet unnumbered hours in the day--hours that
recurred in the dead watches of the night--when our heroine pondered
distractedly over the coming great change in her life. "How I wish,"
she would think to herself at these times, "I had done like those
Trappists we saw in the south of France, who say to each other over and
over again, 'Brother, think of Death.' If I had only kept saying to
myself, 'It's no use, I've got to be married--It's no use, I've got to
be married,' I suppose it would have seemed as easy and natural to go
to the altar when the time came, as it must seem to them to sink into
the grave that they have been digging for themselves for so long. But I
have always put away the thought of the inevitable. It seemed so far
off--as far as to be grown-up seems when one is a child; and now the
time has really come, and I don't feel more ready to meet my fate than
if the marriage had been only this minute arranged."</p>

<p>If Portia, however, was in no bridal frame of mind, the same cannot
be said of John. If he could have reversed the Joshuan miracle, and
sent the sun coursing round the heavens, in accordance with Israelitish
cosmogony, in double-quick time, he would certainly have done so during
the weeks that intervened between his arrival in London and his
wedding-day. There were moments when Portia felt an inexplicable
physical shrinking in his presence, as though he were literally
hungering to devour her bodily, and were whetting his lips in
anticipation of the feast. She would entreat the good-natured Emma to
accompany her whenever she went out with him, though her sister-in-law
was not particularly well fitted either actually or metaphorically for
playing the part of bodkin; and had she been brought up upon the system
of the typical convent-bred jeune fille, instead of upon that of an
Australian bush maiden who had been allowed to run wild during the
greater portion of her life, she could not have maintained a more
demure demeanour when she found herself for a few instants alone with
him. She felt herself indeed at these times not unlike Andersen's
Ice-maiden. But John had ardency enough to melt the snows on the frosty
Caucasus itself. The best means she could find for leading him away
from the topic of his all-absorbing love for her, was to talk about
their future plans. They were to return to London after a tour in
Norway, where Portia, to whom even English twilights were a matter of
constant surprise and delight, was to behold a sun-illumined night.
After which they were to instal themselves temporarily in a private
apartment at a West-End hotel. John declared that once they were
married he would never let her out of his sight. "I'll stick to you
like your shadow, my darling," he said; "there'll never have been such
spoons in this world as you and me."</p>

<p>Portia on these occasions would maintain a dead silence. Sometimes,
like a slowly-fading picture in a dissolving view, a dim presentment of
Harry's Madonna and Child would shape itself before her gaze as she
listened. But the impression was growing fainter and fainter, and the
unaccountable dread of renewing it prevented her from going to the
Academy to see the actual picture again.</p>

<p>Never, in the course of her eighteen years of thinking life--for
before the age of three the impressions upon a child's mind efface each
other like the scrolls on a palimpsest--never had Portia felt so
awfully alone as during the few weeks that preceded her wedding-day.
With brother, sister, and lover all trying to heap fresh proofs of
their tenderness upon her; with newly-made friends running in and out
daily with a thousand offers of service and sympathy, she had a
sensation of completest isolation. There was no one to whom she could
speak of what she really felt, no one to whom she could turn for
reassurance against her own forebodings. Never had she such a full
understanding of the truth that money cannot buy peace of mind. As she
drove from shop to shop with her sister and her betrothed, to inspect
the dainty adornments they deemed necessary for her, it seemed to her
that she was only buying the chains with which she would be loaded on
her marriage-day. "Why cannot I speak out?" she would ask herself
despairingly, as she lay reviewing her position in feverish unrest in
the night-time. "Here I am, in the midst of the people who profess to
be the fondest of me in the world, and I cannot say to them--and to
John first of all--'Only show your love by making a little sacrifice.
Give me just a little more time to get used to you.'"</p>

<p>But when the morning came, her courage would fail her afresh. How
could she find it in her heart to hurl such a bombshell into the midst
of all their pleasant anticipations! Moreover, if it was simply a
matter of getting used to John, would not the wisest way of achieving
it be to let him marry her at the appointed time! In one sense she had
been more used to him years ago than she was now, so that the
probability of her accustoming herself in the way she desired, seemed
to be in inverse ratio to the time she was given to do it in. Curiously
enough she had felt used to Harry within two minutes of her meeting him
in front of the closed Academy doors. How could one account for such
perplexing contradictions! And how, above all, could one help feeling
as one did!</p>

<p>There was one friend, and one only, to whom Portia felt she could
have made plenary confession at this time; but that was a friend who
was not at present within her reach. Upon the journey home in the P.
and O. boat Ismail, a lady returning from Egypt had joined the steamer
at Port Said, whom Portia had felt at once to be unlike anybody she had
seen before. Mrs. James had not been pleasantly impressed by her. "Ach!
she would topsy-turvy us all," she said; "she has no gommon-sense!" But
certain people, and Portia among them, believed that she was endowed
with uncommon sense, and of such an exceptional kind, that the most
ordinary matters in the world seemed to show themselves under a novel
and interesting aspect in her company. Instead of looking at things
through everybody else's glasses, she looked at them through her
own--Anna Ross's--glasses; and though the view inclined her, no doubt
to adopt the benevolently ironical standpoint that Renan declares to be
the only one compatible with philosophy and culture, she did not adopt
it outwardly or aggressively, but kept it for herself and a few of the
initiated. She had taken a liking to Portia--such as solitary women
with male brains will sometimes take for a charming young girl who has
a na&iuml;ve and unbounded, withal a timid admiration for them--had
made her sit with her on the forecastle when she chose to retreat
thither for a quiet smoke upon sleepy afternoons in the Mediterranean,
and had listened with a half-smiling, half sphinx-like demeanour to the
young girl's tales of her life in the Australian bush, as one would
listen to the prattle of a favourite child. She had made Portia promise
to write to her from time to time, and the latter had done so at least
once in two months since they had parted at Plymouth. The address that
had been given her was that of a street in Paris where Anna had her
atelier, and where she received communications addressed indifferently
to "Monsieur" or "Mademoiselle Ross, artiste-peintre." Portia had tried
to see her friend during her hurried visit to Paris, but Miss Ross was
out of town. She had therefore been fain to content herself by leaving
a short letter for her, in which she informed Anna of her approaching
marriage. To this communication she had received no answer, and the
longing to write again, and to se r&eacute;pandre in the true
significance of the word, in a letter that none but Anna could read,
was checked by the fear that it would not arrive at its destination.
Meanwhile, the days went relentlessly by, until the fatal morning
arrived. It is a mistake to suppose that the time which seems to pass
the most quickly is invariably that which is occupied by the most
agreeable sensations. To Portia her last week of grace seemed to travel
with the swiftness of a gathering storm; and, by way of intensifying
the morbid tension of mind from which she was suffering, she chose for
her nightly reading that most appalling psychological study of Hugo's,
called Le dernier jour d'un condamn&eacute;. She felt in every nerve
and fibre each line of the hideous narrative, and the opening phrase of
one of the concluding chapters, "Eh bien donc, ayons courage avec la
mort. Prenons cette horrible id&eacute;e &agrave; deux mains, et
consid&eacute;rons-la en face. Demandons-lui compte de ce qu'elle est,
&amp;c.," seemed, by the substitution of the words "mon sort" for "la
mort," to meet her case so exactly, that the altar would assume in her
imagination the very shape and substance of the sinister machine on the
Place de Gr&egrave;ve, with "les deux bras rouges avec leur triangle
noir au bout." Small wonder if, when the morning of the wedding--day
actually arrived, her heart failed her, and she would fain have begged
once more for a reprieve.</p>

<p>But the time for reprieves was past. If she had been actually in the
hands of the gendarmes, who laid pitiless hands upon Victor Hugo's
condemned man as he grovelled in the last abasement of sick terror at
the commissaire's feet, she could not have felt more powerless to free
herself. The gendarmes, in her case, were represented by Emma and her
brother and her friends (the clergyman who was to perform the ceremony
might take the place of the bourreau), all of whom had her in their
grasp to-day. She had felt hitherto as though a door of escape might
still be opened to her on the last morning; but now she knew, as the
condemned man in the cart had known, that the thing that loomed before
her was the Reality.</p>

<p>They were hardly suitable reflections these for the typical bride
whom the sun shines on--and the sun did shine on this late July
morning, with the veiled intensity that only a London sun can manifest
upon occasion. Portia sat by the open window with a loose wrap thrown
over her shoulders, a cataract of descending hair falling below her
hips. The pallor that her night-watches had set upon her cheeks was
visible in the morning light; but to a face so fair as hers, with youth
and health painted on the lips and sparkling in the eyes, paleness is
not an unbecoming attribute. She was tired of thinking now. The less
she thought, she told herself, the better. She laid her head down upon
her hands, resting them in their turn on the window-sill, while a line
in The Light of Asia that Anna had given her to read, "Who shall shut
out Fate?" recurred to her mind. Her fate was lying in waiting for her
outside this peaceful room, with the rose-bed in the garden that she
had grown so fond of. It would be upon her in another moment, and even
while she was pondering she heard a sudden knock at the door.</p>

<p>She started. It was as though she had herself summoned her destiny.
"Come in," she said tremblingly; but it was only the maid, who brought
her a letter that had come by the first post. Portia took it listlessly
into her hands. The writing--a queer, cramped, lopsided writing
enough--was familiar to her as Anna Ross's. "At last!" she said, as,
dismissing the maid, she shook back her cloudy mantle of hair, and set
herself to discover what her friend had to say to her about the great
event impending. As she read, the listlessness disappeared, and a
strange, eager look gathered in her eyes. What Anna had written was as
follows:</p>

<p>"You don't expect me, my dear little girl, to add banal
congratulations to those that have doubtless been heaped upon you
already. What concerns me solely in the news you have given me is, how
far your immediate happiness may be affected by it. Of your future
happiness, despite what silly people may tell you to the contrary, you
can know nothing, nor I either; but the readjustment of your actual
life in the way you propose must affect it at the present moment for
weal or for woe, and I am anxious beyond expression to hear that it is
for weal. One man's meat is, as you know, another man's poison. From my
own point of view, marriage, as it is at present understood, is the
most foolish and suicidal step a woman can take. Why should we bind
ourselves to belie for the remainder of our natural lives our real
natures, our real selves, as expressed in the new instincts,
promptings, or desires we may feel? Why, in short, should the union of
a man and woman, which is meaningless and worth nothing without mutual
inclination, be made the occasion of vows and oaths, and so-called
binding ceremonies, which are not binding at all when the inclination
is gone? The entire system upon which marriage is based is an outrage
to common sense. It is one of the few contracts that must necessarily
be entered into in the dark, and, at the same time, the one of all
others that it is the hardest to cancel. If, at least, the law which
regulated marriage had allowed for the laws which govern our being, and
had made of it an engagement of a specified duration renewable at
pleasure, there might be something to be said in mitigation of it. As
it stands at present, I hold it in abhorrence, as one of the cumbersome
contrivances by which man, who has systematized war and rapine, and
oppression and persecution, has further burdened our existence upon
earth; and I always feel more prompted to send a cypress branch than an
orange wreath to an expectant bride.</p>

<p>"But this 'sortie,' dear child, must not discompose you. Though you
do not tell me so, it can be for no other reason than the one that you
love John Morrisson--at least, in the present--that you are going to be
married to him. Therefore, I hope you may be as happy as you would be
were you spared the marriage ceremony altogether. You are full young
(you look so, at least) to forfeit your liberty. Perhaps you will be
shocked when I tell you I think every woman should see something of
life before settling down, if to settle down at all is consistent with
her nature. You have not had that advantage; and, seeing that at
twenty-one you are legally your own mistress, it is a pity you did not
give yourself time to come and take up your quarters here with me for a
space, where you could have looked into the heart of things a little
more than you have been accustomed to do hitherto. Remember this,
anyhow. If now, or at any other time, you need a refuge, a place where
you will be absolutely free to think, to say, to do whatever you please
and how you please--to live, in fact, your own life, just as your
instincts may lead you--come to me. You will find my arms, my hearth,
and my home--such as it is--open to you. It is not even necessary to
write beforehand. I have given your name to the concierge, who has
orders to deliver you the key of my studio at any time you may appear
upon the scene (I keep no servant). Tell me when you expect to be
married, and whether I cannot persuade you to come to me
beforehand."</p>

<p>Portia read this letter twice. The effort of deciphering Anna's
handwriting seemed to drive the meaning home. It was a letter as
unsuitable to the occasion as her own thoughts had been, and for this
reason it appealed strongly to her sympathies. The arguments against
marriage, which are familiar to most people who have read the pour and
the contre as set forth by Mrs. Lynn Linton on the one hand, and Mrs.
Mona Caird on the other, were all new and startling to her. In her
present frame of mind, they seemed to bear a wonderful stamp of truth
as well. How such a letter would have affected her if it had been Harry
Tolhurst, or someone with the self--same eyes and voice, to whom she
was expected to swear love and allegiance that morning, she did not
stop to ask herself. She went to her writing-table, the Wouvermans
table, which Wilmer had caused to be stocked with every imaginable
adjunct and extracted therefrom a telegram form, upon which she
scribbled the words: "Thanks; but too late. Must be married this
morning.--Portia," and addressing it to Miss Ross, 317 Rue de
Vaugirard, rang the bell and requested that it should be carried
forthwith to the nearest telegraph office. To Emma, who came in a few
moments later, clad in a dressing-gown of pale green satin, shrouded in
diaphonous lace, and who melted into "Achs!" and "Gottlobs!"
innumerable over the Braut, she made no mention of her letter. Was it
in obedience to some mysterious presentiment that she had never even
revealed Anna's whereabouts to her relatives either, the fact remains
that as soon as she was alone, after reading the communication a third
time and thus entirely mastering its meaning, she struck a match, and
holding the letter to the flame watched it consume slowly in the open
grate into which she had thrown it, until it had curled into black
shreds. Her last hope of succour, at the eleventh hour, died out of her
heart; the door of escape had remained closed, and she prepared, as the
history-books tell us of queenly victims upon the scaffold, to meet her
fate with resignation and fortitude.</p>

<h3>Chapter VIII</h3>

<p>WHO that has ever watched a group of nursery-maids and errand-boys
assembled in the neighbourhood of a house with a striped awning, where
a wedding is impending, can deny imagination to the poorer classes?
Well might one put the question to them, "What went ye out for to see?"
since the reward of their long and patient dawdling on the pavement is
often little more than a transient glimpse of a lace-or
cashmere-enveloped figure, which, for all they can really see of it,
might equally well represent a Mussulman lady (I wonder why a
Mussulwoman is never heard of?) wrapped in her disguising "feredje," as
an English bride. Among the scenes of London life in the season that
Tissot has painted so well, a fashionable wedding, looked at from the
point of view of the crowd outside, might form an amusing and
characteristic subject. The picture should be made to represent the
covered awning, bright with buff and scarlet stripes, which, while it
conceals everything worth seeing from the beholder, presents
nevertheless such an irresistible attraction to the loiterers on the
pavement. As regards their own share in the show, it is certainly a
case in which a very little is made to go a very long way--as little,
maybe, as a fleeting view of the bride's silk-encased ankles as she
mounts quickly into the carriage, or of the exterior surface of her
bridal bouquet after she is seated inside. But as imagination, as
Shakespeare has told us, "bodies forth the form of things unknown,"
even such vague indications as those conveyed by the ankles and the
bouquet send the nursery-maids and errand-boys on their way rejoicing;
and to have their imaginations stimulated in the same direction they
will lie in wait for the next wedding-party with equal pertinacity, and
be as thankful as ever for the same small mercies as those that have
just fallen to their share.</p>

<p>In the bridal party which left the door of the Kensington mansion on
Portia's wedding-day, there was nothing, however, to appeal to the
imagination of passing nursemaids and errand-boys. There was no awning,
which serves on these occasions as a rallying-flag for the crowd; there
were no favours; and there was no throwing of rice or flinging of
white--satin slippers. Having obtained the one great concession he had
pleaded for, John had yielded upon every other point to the wishes of
his bride. Indeed, he showed almost as great a desire to have the
marriage ceremony conducted quietly and privately as herself. Though
she had been obliged to give way as regarded the "going-away bonnet,"
Portia had remained firm upon other points. There was nothing to betray
the bride in her appearance as she came down stairs on her wedding
morning arrayed in just the same clothes as she might have worn to
drive into Regent Street on a round of morning shopping. The
tailor-made frock was packed away. There were associations bound up
with it that would make it hard for her to wear it again for many a
long day. But her bridal array was none the less as demure in its way
as the far-famed Jenny Wren's, upon the memorable occasion when she
promised Cock Robin to "always wear her brown gown, and never dress too
fine." It was in one of those indefinable hues that French artistes
call feuille morte--a hue that may embrace a chromatic scale of colour
ranging from vivid scarlet to palest gold, if the term be literally
applied, but which, from the tailleuse stand-point signifies a shade as
near the one preferred by the modest Jenny as possible. In this soft,
dead-leaf setting, which brought into relief the warm tints in her hair
and eyes (when you looked into them closely, Portia's eyes were not
unlike a certain variety of jasper), with her pale cheeks, and the red
line of her half parted lips, the bride looked pretty enough. She
possessed one of those entirely supple figures which no dressmaker's
craft can simulate, and even the conventionally made gown went into
unexpectedly classic curves upon it.</p>

<p>Mrs. James, meanwhile, did not fall short in her self-adopted
r&ocirc;le of unconscious foil upon the occasion. Dead-leaf or dead
anything else was not for her at her sister-in-law's wedding. She had
never been an upholder of the self-effacing theory in any of its
applications. Her gown was distinctly of the voyant order, and, what
was more, she meant it to be so. There is an even stronger adjective
than voyant in the word criard, which implies an association of ideas
in dress that the English may feel, but which they have never been able
to put into words. Mrs. James's dress was both voyant and criard, and
to carry out the French train of comparisons, the colors swore as well.
She wore a bonnet wreathed with apple-blossoms that would have been an
exquisite work of art anywhere removed from the immediate neighbourhood
of her head; a visite crusted with coruscating beads that flashed
parti-coloured rays around her as she walked; and a train of sapphire
velvet with salmon-coloured satin trimmings, that had been originally
made, against her own better judgment, by a theatrical faiseuse in
Paris as a theatre or dinner-dress. Thus attired, and carrying quite
gratuitously a terracotta parasol with lace flounces, Emma mounted with
her sister-in-law into the closed brougham which was to drive them to
Kensington Church hard by. Very little was said on the way. Mrs. James
found frequent occasion to apply a gold-topped scent-bottle to her
nostrils, and to offer the same to her companon, sitting, "like rare
pale Marguerite," in abstracted, silence by her side. Of the two, her
emotion, was, perhaps, at this moment the keenest. Portia had fought
her battle. She had been fighting it night and day for weeks past.
There were scars left behind, of which the pain might be divined by a
certain set look in the eyes, as well as by the compressed lines around
her red lips. But this morning she had capitulated; she had laid down
her arms once and forever. Perhaps, after all, there was a certain
sense of relief in knowing that the struggle was at an end; such a
relief as the vanquished may feel, perchance, when they open the gates
they have defended so long and so wearily to the beleaguering enemy.
Whatever might betide, she must make the best of it now. And how many
women there are, after all, she reflected, who go through life, and get
a good deal of happiness out of it too, without any share in the thing
we call Love. Perhaps there was only a fixed quantity of it in the
universe, as there is of health and prosperity and other good things,
and it fell to the lot of none but the favoured few to enjoy it. At any
rate, it was a thing one could do without.</p>

<p>Farther in her reflections Portia was unable to go, for the brougham
had drawn up before the church door, and Wilmer, in a frock-coat and
white waist-coat (he had as nearly as possible slung his racing-glasses
across it), his left eye screwed up painfully behind his eyeglass, was
waiting to assist them to descend. And now John came out to meet them
from the porch, and seized a hand of each. His thick red beard had been
cut and trimmed in Renaissance fashion, and he looked more like a
jovial Henri de Navarre or Henry VIII. than ever. The impalpable
substance he was tasting must have had more relish than ever this
morning, for to Portia it seemed that his lips worked unceasingly. "I
must break him of that habit when we are married," she thought; and
this, it is to be feared, was the reflection that was uppermost in her
mind as she walked up the nave by his side. Of order in the wedding
party there was none. The little group of four stood before the altar
in a line, so that in the eyes of an indifferent observer they might
have been undergoing marriage indiscriminately, and Wilmer had to be
twice reminded that it was his duty to give away "this woman," under
which designation he had somehow never thought of his sister. The only
person who, mindful of etiquette, wept in her handkerchief was Emma,
and even this was done in an obviously perfunctory manner. The
clergyman, who had been bidden to the feast that was to precede the
departure of the wedded pair, fixed to take place at five the same
afternoon walked home with Mr. James. Emma had insisted upon abandoning
the brougham to Mr. and Mrs. Morrisson, and had driven off in serene
and unwitnessed triumph in a hansom. Thus it was that Portia found
herself for a few minutes alone with her husband as they drove back to
the house. Her husband! This big, red-bearded man with whom she had
just walked down the nave--her husband! The idea was so unnatural that
it seemed almost grotesque. Never had she felt him so complete a
stranger to her as at this moment. Far more of a stranger, indeed, than
when the only tie that had bound her to him was that of a close and
early friendship. She wondered now whether she could have been under
the vague impression that the fact of standing before the altar and
repeating the formula set forth in a particular part of her prayerbook,
must of necessity operate an immediate miracle, and inspire her with
wifely sentiment for him. If she had been under any such illusion it
vanished now, as John took his seat by her side in his newly assumed
character of her legal lord and master. And by her side he would be
"to--morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow," and so on through all the
morrows to come, "to the last syllable of recorded time." Day and night
he would be by her side, and she--God forgive her!--would have asked no
greater boon of Heaven than to see him depart upon his wedding journey
alone.</p>

<p>Another fatal discovery she made during this homeward drive was that
the more loudly John proclaimed his happiness, the less she felt
inclined to share in it herself. To have to sympathise with him for
loving her, when it seemed so impossible to love him in return, was a
hard task. It was like being called upon to act in real earnest the
unsatisfactory part of the guest at the Barmecide's Feast, who, while
seated before an empty board, is constrained to praise the exquisite
flavours of the imaginary dishes his host continues to press upon him.
And with what genuine conviction John played the part of the host! How
terribly in earnest he was! How completely he believed that what to her
was Dead Sea fruit was, in point of fact, real nectar and ambrosia!
What royal dishes, served up at what a never-ending Agapemone, he
seemed to behold; while, to her, the table was bare indeed, and the
prospect little better than one of slow starvation! He had taken her
hand--the ungloved one, upon which the first fetter, in the shape of
the broad wedding-ring, had just been placed--almost as soon as he
entered the carriage, and was placing it close over his heart.</p>

<p>"Just feel how it beats, deary," he said; "I never thought of you,
Portia, through all the years I've loved you, but it used to beat like
that. It used to beat sometimes fit to burst. And to think I've got you
to myself at last! Yes," he repeated, in tones of husky triumph, "all
to myself. There's no one can part us now. Neither God nor devil can
take you from me now!"</p>

<p>He uttered the reckless words without any blasphemous intent--in the
mere wild jubilation of his mood. But the blear-eyed Fates--or
whichever of the three grim old women it may be whose office it is to
avenge the outraged gods--had already taken due note of them. Even
science has not been able to dispel the instinctive dread implanted in
the breast of man, from the savage to the sage, the dread of exciting
the jealousy of the powers that be by defiant boasts of a happiness
beyond the measure allotted to mortals. But John was intoxicated with
his newborn bliss, as one drunk with new wine, and he did not count the
meaning of his words.</p>

<p>Portia, in her present calm and sad disposition of mind, was
frightened at their vehemence. By some unaccountable freak of fancy
they seemed to conjure up once more the picture of Harry's Madonna to
her spiritual vision. She had thought the noonday spectre had been
finally laid to rest; but here it was again confronting her, with the
same dark enigmatic expression in its haunting eyes as when she had
first stood in front of it at the Academy by Harry's side. To free her
mind from the oppression of it, she raised her eyes timidly towards her
husband. What an exultant look there was in his face! And how his lips,
that the close, square cut of beard and moustache had almost disclosed
entirely, seemed to relish the impalpable delicacies they were tasting!
It made her almost feel like Little Red Riding-Hood in presence of the
wolf to watch them--only John had not a wolf-face though just now, it
must be owned, there was something in it that recalled a hungry wolf's
expression.</p>

<p>"We shall not be in Norway more than a fortnight, nor away more than
three weeks in all, I suppose, John?" she questioned timidly.</p>

<p>She had forced herself to pronounce his name; but it was uttered
almost under her breath. He heard it, nevertheless, and turned a
rapturous face towards her.</p>

<p>"We won't be in a hurry to get back, I promise you, my pet," he
said. "It's a stupid arrangement that we've got to stick on there at
Emma's until five o'clock this afternoon. I tell you what: we'll go
away as soon as lunch is over. We can go for a drive or something till
it's time for our train."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I can't," protested his wife, her heart sinking at the
prospect. "I left all kinds of things to do to the last, and I shall
have to be up in my room putting by and packing up to the last
moment."</p>

<p>"I'll come and help you, then; it'll help to pass the time."</p>

<p>"No!" she said, wondering at the decision of her own voice; "that
cannot be. You must sit and smoke with Wilmer until I come to call
you."</p>

<p>"Those are my orders, eh!" he said laughingly. "You're going to
begin to boss me already, are you? Now you'll just see what you gain by
that."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, my best going-away bonnet!" shrieked Portia, covering her
face with her hands; and at this moment the brougham came to an
opportune standstill at the door of the Kensington mansion.</p>

<p>I am not going to enter into details respecting the glories of the
"breakfast-lunch" (as Mrs. James called it) that followed. It is a
sorry task to describe not-to-be tasted dishes, almost as sorry as to
assist at the Barmecide's Feast afore-mentioned. Everyone can imagine
for himself the perfection of Wilmer's old port--about which, perhaps,
his judgment was surer (though not in his own opinion) than with regard
to his "old masters." Everyone may likewise take it for granted that
the chicken mayonnaise, the Cingalese curry, and the p&acirc;t&eacute;
de foie gras in aspic were all that they ought to have been. Mrs.
James, like Todgers's, could do it when she chose, and, with a
perpetual silver-mine in Queensland to fall back upon, it was not hard
for her to emulate Mrs. Todgers when she did choose. Although there was
no one but the clergyman to be impressed by them, the wedding-cake was
wreathed with as brave a show of costly orchids and out-of-season
blooms as though all London had been there to applaud. Nothing, indeed,
that the proceeds of the silver-mine could procure to heighten the
effect had been forgotten; and as nobody was to suspect that, in the
case of at least one of those who sat down to the banquet, the
traditional dinner of herbs would have been far preferable if the
traditional compensating element had been there as well, it followed
that, on the surface, all appeared to go as "merrily as a marriage
bell." Mr. Benson, the clergyman, to whom Australians of Wilmer's type
were a new experience, sat on the right hand of the gorgeous
sapphire-velvet-and-salmon-silk-arrayed mistress of the house, with the
newly-married couple opposite to him. Upon these he made his
reflections between the intervals of tasting Wilmer's Australian wine,
or listening to his opinions concerning Imperial Federation from an
antipodean point of view. The bride appeared to him to be somewhat too
refined for her surroundings; and what a curiously far--away look those
strange brown eyes of hers, with the warm, rust-colored motes in the
iris, seemed to wear! What a singular contrast they presented to the
prominent eyes of the man who had just been made her husband--wherein
the love of good cheer was perhaps a little too plainly written! Then
the host was not quite like any one he had ever met before.
Nevertheless, Wilmer's conversation was interesting to him. He knew all
about the State school organisation in the various Australian colonies,
could tell of the origin and growth of the eight-hours' system all over
Australia, and, as long as he abstained from talking of Claudes and
Ruysdaels, was an intelligent companion enough. He even possessed a
certain glibness in speech-making, and, after he had successfully
wedged his eyeglass into its place, stood up before the little party of
four (a much harder thing than to stand up before a party of forty) and
drank to the health of the newly-married couple, "whose union," he
declared, "had cemented ties that had first been formed in the forest
primeval, and that were now more firmly knit than ever in the midst of
civilisation."</p>

<p>John, without rising from his seat, responded by declaring that he
had never been much of a fist at speech-making. But his friend Wilmer
might make his mind easy about one thing. He knew he was the luckiest
chap in the world, and he hoped they would never regret giving him
Portia for his wife. He meant to do all a man could do to prove himself
deserving of his happiness. His flow of speech failing him at this
point, Wilmer rapped the table and said "Hear, hear," and the clergyman
came to the rescue by proposing the health of the hostess, coupled with
that of the bride. After this ceremony Portia was free to make her
escape upstairs, where she hoped to spend the last few hours of her
liberty in mournful, unhampered solitude.</p>

<h3>Chapter IX</h3>

<p>THE next episode in the strange, eventful history of our heroine is
of so curious and unprecedented a nature, that it is necessary to bear
in mind the often-proved truth that Fact is stranger than Fiction, to
make it in any way possible of belief. It concerns an event that could
only have been brought about by one of those fortuitous combinations of
circumstances that we have agreed to call by the name of Chance; as
though every event, no matter of how trivial a kind, were not the
result of a long and intricate chain of antecedent causes, whose first
links (if, indeed, there be any first in the matter at all) are lost in
primeval chaos. Hitherto the narrative of Portia's life has run
smoothly enough. Her quiet school-days in Melbourne; her happy, healthy
existence in the Bush; her dogs and her horses; her sudden leap into
richer surroundings; her journey to Europe; her travels on the
Continent, where the first step to knowledge, in the perception that
she was woefully ignorant, was primarily taken; her London balls and
innocent flirtations, and finally her marriage with a man round whose
feet she had played as a child--in all these smooth though varied
experiences there has been nothing that could come under the heading of
strange or eventful. It is only from the time when we mount with her
into that pretty room of hers upstairs, where we witnessed a few weeks
back the scene of her discovery of John's flowers--fraught with so
mighty a significance--that there is aught in her career to justify the
use of the words. To have been married somewhat against the grain was
neither strange nor eventful, for, if not in England, in other
countries at least, marriages of this kind are frequent enough. The
unprecedented part of her history has still, therefore, to come; only,
in order to show how such a thing as befel her could be possible, it
will be necessary to say a few words about her immediate entourage.</p>

<p>The house, then, that the Jameses inhabited communicated at the
back, by means of a garden gate, of which the cook kept the key, with
an alley that gave free access to Kensington High Street It was a means
of egress and ingress that was only utilised by the servants, and its
existence might almost have remained unsuspected by the masters for all
the use they made of it. The existence of this door and this alley of
communication is a necessary point to bear in mind. Another matter upon
which it is needful to insist is the relation in which Portia stood to
the domestics. From the blue--and-silver "Jeames" to the scullery-maid
who came from the orphanage, one and all adored her. To have addressed
them in any other than the natural friendly give-and-take voice in
which she had been wont to chat from her childhood upwards with the
station hands on Wilmer's run, would have been impossible to her.
Hence, everyone in the house rendered her prompt and willing service.
There was only one, however, who could by any means aspire to the
r&ocirc;le of confidante in the sense in which we see that important
function filled on the French stage by the lady whose duty it is to
play "second fiddle" to the distracted heroine, and to receive the
outpouring of her sombre confidences; and this was not an English
servant at all, but a girl--she might still by courtesy be called a
girl--who, some twelve or fifteen years older than her mistress, had
been her first and only nurse. Her position in the Kensington house was
ostensibly that of Portia's maid; but our heroine, notwithstanding the
affection she cherished for nurse Eliza, was accustomed to do for
herself, in the best sense of this familiar un-Websterian phrase, and
beyond an occasional brushing and combing of her young mistress's
resplendent locks, Eliza found little to do but to brush her
riding-habit and put in her frillings. Being, however, of a
conscientious turn of mind, she employed her leisure in checking the
transactions of the cook with the tradespeople, and was consequently a
thorn in the side of all the personnel, from the butler downwards. That
this woman would have gone through fire and water--not only
metaphorically but actually--to save her, Portia entertained not the
smallest doubt. Eliza had had a love disappointment, but, instead of
being soured by it, she had turned the pent-up flood of her affections
in the direction of her charge, and the little girl had felt herself
borne along upon it, as upon a smooth, strong current, until she grew
to womanhood. Why she did not confide in her nurse during the troublous
time that preceded her union with John Morrisson it would be hard to
say. I am afraid it was for the reason that, though she could make sure
of Eliza's unbounded love and devotion, she did not feel so certain of
her wisdom; and here it may be said she was mistaken. Real affection is
wonderfully clairvoyant, and singleness of purpose and goodness of
heart will often dictate the proper thing to be said and done more
surely than the most cultivated intellect. However this may be, Portia
never disclosed her secret; and though she pined in thought, as she did
not at the same time wear an outward green and yellow melancholy, it
was not easy to divine her trouble. Eliza opined that her young
mistress could have no aversion to Mr. John, after she had kept company
with him for all these years; and though in her own heart she
considered him too red and too rough to be a suitable match for her
young lady, she would no more have thought of finding fault with the
arrangement, than of cavilling at Mr. James's choice of "old masters,"
or of criticising Mrs. James's taste in dress. It was an understood
thing that, when Portia had a house of her own, nurse Eliza should go
to her in the elastic capacity of confidential servant; and with this
prospect in view, and the sure hope that her mistress would find her
employment as speedily as possible, in the shape of a baby to look
after, she had witnessed the preparations for the wedding with
comparative equanimity.</p>

<p>Now, however, the parting hour grew near. The marriage ceremony had
been solemnised. The breakfast was over. The cake had been cut and
distributed and in a very few hours Portia's home would know her no
more. Mightily depressed by these considerations, which she had never
seemed to fully realise until now, Eliza ascended to her young
mistress's room, with red-rimmed, swollen eyes--she possessed, it may
be said, a good and not uncomely face of her own, of plebeian type--and
implored that she might be allowed to do just whatever came to hand. In
her secret heart Portia, perhaps, would rather have been left alone.
Among the little relics she still had to pack away there were many over
which she would fain have lingered before burying them, and the
associations they conjured up, for ever out of her sight. I have
alluded to her innocent flirtations. More than one was recalled to her
as she turned over the store of her girlish treasures now. Her book of
pressed flowers, wherein every faded blossom was accompanied by the
name of a place and a date, was as full of eloquent meaning to her as
though it had contained pages of burning poems. The chronicle opened
with a sprig of Australian myrtle that John had given her years
ago--and the hand in which she had inscribed the native name of the
place where he had found it, was obviously unformed and childish. But
there were other chapters in the record too. How fresh the bunch of
beautiful wildflowers from King George's Sound still looked, and how
fresh in her mind was the expression on the face of the blue-eyed
second officer of the Ismail who had gathered them for her! How plainly
he had made her understand, before she left the ship, that it was only
his sailor--poverty that prevented him from laying heart and hand at
her feet! And the Alpine edelweiss that a young English traveller--who
turned out to be a great personage at home, and who had spoken so
mysteriously and sadly about the signification of obligations--had
plucked for her!--he who had married the very plain-looking girl with
royal blood in her veins, that had been pointed out to her in the Park
as his bride! These and many others. How plainly they proved that her
heart had been still a rover--all unknown to herself--while she was
addressing her fortnightly duty epistles to her future husband in
Queensland! She would fain have pondered over these and many other
tokens of a past happy existence (how far away from her it seemed
already!) in solitude. There was yet another volume in which neither
flowers were pressed, nor names of places or dates inscribed, and which
seemed nevertheless to have more to say to her than all the rest
together, and this was none other than the prosaic Academy catalogue
that she had not yet found it in her heart to part with, and which she
had deceitfully insinuated, to prevent it from being claimed, into one
of those dainty coverings in old brocades, wherein books in one sense
can certainly be said to wear "new faces." The only message it
contained was in the underlining in violet pencil-marks of certain
paintings, statues, and engravings. Yet to Portia it furnished a text
for many a reverie. In whatever other respect nurse Eliza might be
fitted to play the r&ocirc;le of confidante, it was not upon topics
like these that our heroine could unburden her mind to her. The fancies
suggested by her collection of souvenirs intimes were not of those that
can well be uttered aloud. So delicate and fleeting they were, indeed,
that she hardly even formulated them in her own mind. They might have
been embodied in a nocturne, set in a minor key, to be deftly played in
the twilight, but nothing more. However, as she could not ask Eliza to
depart in the face of her tear-swollen eyes, and with the certain
knowledge that the faithful creature would proceed to cry them out in
real earnest as soon as she was outside the door, she busied her in
wrapping up and putting by some indifferent books taken from the
book-shelf for the special purpose--a work which might have been just
as well left, she told herself, until her return. Eliza was finding an
outlet for her emotions in banging and dusting these volumes, which
required, to tell the truth, neither form of discipline, accompanying
the operation meanwhile by an occasional sniff of distress, when she
was suddenly summoned from the room. She was away long enough to give
Portia the time to take up the interrupted train of her somewhat
mournful meditations once more; and when she returned it was with a
face that bore an important hint of something unforeseen and mysterious
to be communicated.</p>

<p>"What has happened, Eliza?" asked her mistress, quietly. As nothing,
not even "God or devil," to quote John's words (that somehow recurred
to her memory at this moment), could un-marry her now, Portia felt that
the would-be importance expressed in her maid's face, in connection
with whatever news she might have to impart to her, was clearly
superfluous and uncalled for. Supposing the kitchen chimney to be on
fire, or the Queen to have suddenly departed this life--the two
contingencies that first suggested themselves to her imagination--she
would none the less have to leave the house as "Mrs. John Morrisson" in
another two hours: none the less be whirled away, by her husband's
side, in the night-train for Flushing, where it was arranged that they
should rest until they resumed their journey on the morrow. So she
repeated once more, in indifferent tones, "What has happened, Eliza? Is
anything wrong?"</p>

<p>The maid shut the door before replying, with the same elaborate air
of mystery that had marked her demeanour from the beginning. There was
something portentous in her expression. "My dear," she said--it was
only upon occasions where etiquette had to be considered that she
called her young mistress "Miss"--"there's a lady below--I won't answer
for it she's a real lady, though--who says she wants to see you. I
never set eyes on her before myself, and she's never been near the
place yet that I know of. She's all in black, and she's brought a baby
along with her. She was that eager and excited when I went down, and
out o' breath with running all the way from High Street--so she told
me. James wouldn't let her in until she told her business; but she
wouldn't, and they couldn't get her to go away neither, and so they had
to send for me."</p>

<p>"I don't see why I shouldn't see her," said Portia, simply; "but did
you ask her whether she could not send me a message by you?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I did," said the maid. "It would not have been in
human nature--not in an abigail's nature, at least--to refrain from the
temptation of making the most of the occasion." 'What is your business,
ma'am?' I said--just like that. 'Our young lady is going away on her
honeymoon this very afternoon, and can't see you,' I says. The lady
says nothing to that for a good minute or more. She seemed to be
catching her breath, like, behind her veil; for she's got a long black
veil, that thick you can't hardly see her face through it. Then she
says, in a kind of a choked voice, 'So Miss James is married!' she
says. 'Married this morning, ma'am,' says I. 'Well,' says she, holding
her throat--this way--'I hope you'll let me see her. I've got a present
for her; it's a present no one can give her but me. Perhaps she'll take
it along with her on her wedding-trip. Ask her to see me for her own
sake, if she won't see me for mine,' I says. The lady says nothing to
that for a good minute or more. She seemed to be catching her breath,
like, behind her veil; for she's got a long black veil, that thick you
can't hardly see her face through it. And with that she outs with a
pencil and a bit of paper from her pocket, hitches her baby under her
arm, and scribbles off a letter as fast as you please; and nothing'll
content her after that but we must fetch her a henvelope from below
stairs, and she must gum it down herself."</p>

<p>Having improved the occasion to her own satisfaction as regarded the
agreeable and stimulating task of narrating all the preliminaries in
extenso, Eliza now bethought herself of handing the letter to her
mistress. Portia took it from her with irresolute hands. What possible
reference to her own affairs could the affairs of the mysterious
visitor involve? And why should she have chosen her wedding-day of all
others as the one upon which to divulge the secret? Her cheeks were
flushed with agitated anticipation as she tore the envelope open. Was
it relief, was it disappointment, was it simple astonishment that was
painted in her face as she read: "It is Mary Willett that begs and
prays of you to see her--the daughter of John Willett, of Yarraman
Station. I would have come before, but I only just heard by chance an
hour ago that you were getting married to Mr. Morrisson. For the love
of Heaven, Miss James, let me see you alone. I won't delay you
long."</p>

<p>Mary Willett! The girl who was to join her father at the dear old
homestead Portia had loved so well! The little lass, about whom she had
heard so much and so often from old John, as she galloped by his side
round the station fences! The person about whom she had asked, before
all others, to be informed at her first memorable interview with her
lover six weeks ago. Mary Willett in London, and in distress--most
evidently in distress! Oh, why had not she known it before? Of course
she would see her, of course she would help her! The trouble whatever
it might be, was clearly one that concerned poor Mary alone. But
perhaps she had felt a delicacy in speaking of it before strangers, and
had therefore purposely tried to give the impression that it was
connected with a matter concerning Portia herself. Well, she had still
two hours--three nearly--that she could call her own. It was a pity
that all questions of money settlements should have been deferred until
after her marriage, and that at this moment she should have nothing but
fifteen sovereigns and some odd silver in her possession. Mary might
need immediate help, and she must have it. Thinking these things over
in the flash of an instant, Portia turned to the eagerly-expectant
Eliza, and disappointed her cruelly by announcing in a calm voice, "It
is nothing, really nothing, Eliza; someone who has been recommended to
me. I know the name quite well; and I ought to see her alone, I think,
as she makes such a point of it."</p>

<p>A drama that was destined not to go beyond the prologue--a tale
brought to an immediate and unexpected close, just as it had been
launched upon the significant opening of "Once upon a while"! This, in
other words, was the comment that Eliza, swallowing her disappointment
as best she could, was fain to pass upon the abrupt termination to the
incident so full of promise that she had witnessed. She felt irritated
with the young woman in black for having made "such a fuss all about
nothing," as she complained to herself, and her irritation was
expressed in the tart way in which she delivered the message, "that
Miss James--Mrs. Morrisson, that was to say--will be pleased to see you
if you'll step this way; but it's as well to remember" (the addition
was her own) "she hasn't a minute to spare."</p>

<p>Portia was standing up to receive them, as Mary, holding her baby
upon her left arm, entered the room. The deep black veil prevented her
from distinguishing at first sight the features of her visitor; but
when Eliza had beaten a reluctant retreat, and had closed the door
finally in her wake, Mary threw back her veil, and Portia uttered an
involuntary cry of surprise. The vision that had pursued her for so
long was standing there in flesh and blood before her. The dim
presentment of Harry's Madonna and Infant that had intruded itself upon
her dreams at night, that had been shadowed forth during her solitary
musings in the daytime, had become a living, breathing reality. The one
presentiment she had ever known had been suddenly and miraculously
verified. "But, oh! how could I feel, when I saw the picture first,"
she asked herself in bewilderment, "that it spoke to me of something I
had vaguely seen and known already? Was it a warning of what was to
come? But, no! It was more like a groping after something I had
lost."</p>

<p>The answer to her question was to come sooner than she could have
anticipated. The explanation of the mystery that had haunted her so
long and so persistently was to fall upon her comprehension at last
like a thunderbolt. Before she had well-nigh recovered from the shock
of surprise that the unexpected appearance of the Madonna in the person
of Mary Willett had occasioned her, the latter had made a rapid step
forward, and was thrusting the baby--a solemn-eyed baby that neither
cried nor laughed--into her arms.</p>

<p>"Take him," she was saying hysterically, as Portia mechanically
stretched out her arms for the child, "take him and keep him. Oh! it's
no time for compliments. Miss James; if you'd been through what I have,
you wouldn't stop to make compliments either. Take him and look at him
well. He's John Morrisson's child, if you want to know. He's nobody
else's. He's my present to John Morrisson and his wife on their
wedding-day. You may give him a lot of children yet, but you won't give
him any that'll be more like their father. You can tell him so from me,
if you choose. Oh, my God, my God! what'll become of us all!"</p>

<p>The last exclamation was accompanied by a burst of unrelieving,
agonising tears. She had sunk down upon the first chair that came to
hand, and was rocking herself to and fro in a reckless abandonment of
despair, as one who had passed the point at which self-restraint and
dignity of demeanour are any longer considerations worth taking into
account.</p>

<h3>Chapter X</h3>

<p>AND Portia! Portia stood, with the baby in her arms (he had
submitted to the transfer, and had even let his head nestle against her
shoulder without any kind of protest), as one turned to stone. For a
moment her brain seemed to refuse to act. Overwhelming as the
revelation she had just heard had been, impossible of realization, or
even of comprehension, as it had appeared, there was yet even more
behind it than Mary herself knew. For here, with her husband's child in
her arms, with John's very eyes looking up towards her from the baby
face, with John's tasting lips repeated in the baby mouth, the haunting
signifiance of Harry's picture had finally come home to Portia's
understanding once and forever. If presentiment had had its say, there
had been a tangible association of ideas as well. How could she have
failed to see the resemblance before! Why need she have waited until
the fatal, the irretrievable step that sealed her doom had been taken
before she thought of coupling the face of the infant in the picture
with the face of the man she called her husband! Oh, fool that she had
been, and fool--a thousand times fool--to let her heart be moved by the
ready lies he had told her! He faithful and constant, serving his time
for her in the bush, as Jacob had served his seven years for his
well-beloved Rachel! He a Sir Galahad among men, as she had innocently
believed him to be! She could have found it in her heart to laugh out
loud, bitterly and scornfully, at her own utter foolishness and
credulity. Well, the awakening had come, and it was a thorough one. All
the written and spoken arguments in the world, all the proofs that
poets and philosophers had ever accumulated of the truth of the simple
statement that "men were deceivers ever," gathered in a heap before
her, could not have brought such strong, such overwhelming conviction
as the one short damnatory experience of the last few seconds. Her
brain seemed literally to reel under the shock, her knees to give way
under her. It was necessary to pull herself together, physically as
well as morally, to call her best energies up before considering what
now remained to be done. She felt as though she had leaped at one bound
from innocent, ignorant girlhood into mature and cynical womanhood.
Never could she feel the same again! Never could the world put on the
same aspect that it had worn only five minutes ago! Never could men and
women, and the relations they bore to each other, become the same that
she had fancied them only this morning! But it was not a time for
dealing with the abstract side of the question. There would be time for
that later. Anna Ross would help to achieve the work of enlightenment
in which Portia herself had taken so tremendous a step on this her
wedding morning. At the present moment it was action--not
reflection--that was needed. What if Mary Willett were secretly married
to John? God forgive her, but it would be the most acceptable solution
of the trouble that she could imagine! Her heart gave a bound at the
thought that even now she might be legally as well as morally free. But
it sank again as she reflected upon the improbability of John's having
performed such a transparently and easily detected feat of bigamy. But
time was speeding, and she would want to escape. At all costs, and
whatever should betide, escape was the first and only consideration.
Let her only try now to keep cool, and to get at the rights of this
wonderful story. With a mighty effort at self-control, she drew near to
where Mary was seated, and still holding John's child tenderly upon her
arm (it is wonderful with what an instinctive knack of tenderness every
true woman, be she maid or mother, will hold a little baby), she laid
her hand upon the sobbing girl's, and said gently: "Tell me all about
it, and how I can help you, Mary. We have known each other in one way,
haven't we, since we were quite children? This is a trouble that
concerns us both, and I must know all there is to know before anything
can be done. First of all, are you married to John Morrisson?"</p>

<p>"No, no! I'm--I'm not," sobbed Mary; "that's where it is. That's why
I'm fit to drown myself, if it wasn't for the baby. Oh, my God! my God!
What is to become of me and him?"</p>

<p>There was no getting her to speak in her present condition. Portia
drew a chair by her side, and sate herself down, with the little one on
her knees, to reflect upon the situation. She felt as though she were
under the influence of one of those portentous dreams, such as Jane
Eyre dreamed the night before she fled from Mr. Rochester--such as most
people have dreamed when the air about them is thick with impending
disaster--a dream wherein she found herself carrying a wailing infant
in her arms, with the impossibility of either laying it down or ridding
herself of the burden. But in her sleep the dreary nightmare had never
weighed upon her with the force of her actual impressions... And who
was there to whom she could turn for help or counsel? Who that would
assist her now to put herself entirely out of John's reach? For as long
as he knew where to find her, there could be no safety, no refuge for
her. Others might laugh at her fears; they might say that in London, in
the nineteenth century, the drama whereby the Sabine maidens became
Roman spouses was one that could not well be repeated. But Portia knew
better. She knew that John considered himself literally in the light of
her legal lord and master now--of her owner, if it came to that. She
had seen it in his eyes as they drove home together in the brougham a
while ago as man and wife. She had seen it in the avidity that marked
his unresting lips. She had heard it in the voice in which he declared
that neither God nor devil could take her from him now. Well! that
might turn out to have been a vain boast after all. She had money
enough, thank Heaven! to enable her to run away and hide herself for
to-day at least, and before they had found her she would have made up
her mind as to the course of action she should take. She would begin by
putting herself under the protection of Anna Ross, whose actual
whereabouts was known to none of them. But time pressed, and there was
still so much to do. Hardly an hour in which to lay her plans and make
her escape. And there was Mary to be thought of, and the baby. And how
were they to make their way out of the house without being seen and
followed! And how should she herself escape pursuit and recapture? The
very recklessness of her project--the danger attending it--seemed to
inspire Portia with courage. Her resolution rose as she measured the
difficulty of her enterprise. Just as the bodily frame will perform
unheard-of feats under the spur of some tremendous excitation, so, in
rare crises, the mind will act with quite a new and unwonted energy.
During the interval that Portia accorded Mary for crying tout son
so&uacute;l (as the French say)--in other words, for sobbing her very
heart out--by her side, she had arranged her plan of escape. The calm
that comes of a supreme resolution irrevocably taken was in her voice
as she addressed herself again to the latter.</p>

<p>"You had better tell me all, Mary," she said gently. "I am sure I
shall be able to help you. Take your little one into your arms
again--so--there. He was just going to cry, and then what should we
have done?"</p>

<p>"You're too g-good to me, miss," gurgled Mary, breaking down once
more; she took the child nevertheless and, Portia--with a spasm of
wonderment, wherein a thousand confused sensations of pity, revolt,
tenderness, and repulsion (the instincts of wifehood, motherhood, and
nature, arrayed against what Carlyle would have called the
artificialities of her actual existence) fought &agrave; tour de
r&oacute;le to get the upper hand--saw her gather the little creature
to her bosom for nourishment. The simple operation of such sublime
significance withal had an instantly pacifying effect upon mother and
child. Portia thought of a certain line in a poem she knew by heart:
'Baby fingers, waxen touches press me from the mother's breast,' with
quite a new understanding of its meaning. In the childless surroundings
she had been accustomed to all her life the ways of mothers and their
offspring had been as a sealed book to her. The ineffable content in
the eyes of the little one--John's very eyes--moved her with an
infinite pity. Not only were mothers and children, but a woman placed
in the circumstances in which Mary had appeared before her, equally
novel facts in her experience. She had read of such cases, certainly.
David Copperfield, for instance, was well known to her; and the
impression she had retained from her reading of that and similar works
was that a "fallen" girl (for this she knew was the approved adjective
to employ in cases so analogous to Mary's)--that a "fallen" woman must
be looked upon as a kind of moral leper, whose very skirts it would be
a contamination for an "honest woman" to touch. Now, however, that she
was drawing her experience no longer from books, but from real living
facts, the matter seemed to put on quite a different aspect. No tragic
phrases suggested themselves to her imagination; nor did they,
apparently, to Mary's. Her mental attitude (as George Eliot would have
said) was not one of anger or indignation, but rather of a great and
sorrowing pity. Mary had probably been deceived by John as she had been
deceived herself, and had believed that, Church or no Church, she was
wedded to him, in point of fact, for time and eternity.</p>

<p>"Tell me how this trouble came upon you, Mary," she asked once more.
"I can be going on with my preparations while you are talking."</p>

<p>Truth to tell, there was little time to lose. She had unstrapped an
ancient valise of small dimensions--it was one of those she had
intended to take upon her wedding-trip, with the na&iuml;ve design of
concealing the fact that she was a bride--and bundling out (for she was
in a desperate hurry) all that bore her new and hated name, she thrust
into it such of her former articles of attire as might be required for
immediate use. The tailor-made suit was next disinterred from its
hiding-place--it would be just the thing to travel in--and away with
her bridal bravery; was she not going to regain her freedom? All the
time she was moving nimbly about the room, making her necessary and
speedy preparations (and perhaps marvelling a little at her own
promptitude of action in an emergency), she was encouraging Mary to
make full and open confession.</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand. I see how it was. Oh, what a pity! Don't be
afraid to tell the rest, Mary." With such intercalations she contrived
to extract from the unwilling lips of the weeping girl the tale of her
own ruin.</p>

<p>"You see, miss," she began--Portia would have been the first to
resent the employment of her new and rightful title--"I was pretty near
the only woman at Yarraman when I went out that time (after you'd gone
away, you know) to keep house for father. There was a lot of men about
the place; but father, he used to keep me pretty well by his side when
he'd be out counting the lambs in the home paddock, maybe, or seeing to
things about the place. He'd be so sorry you was gone. He thought a lot
of me, you know, miss, and he'd say, 'You wouldn't have wanted for
someone to talk to, my dear, if Miss Portia had a-been here.' He
thought no one was too good for me--poor father" (a profound sigh
accompanied these words, followed by a long pause). "Well, I don't
suppose I'd been three weeks at the station--and pretty dull I found
it, I can tell you; it was in the January, and the place so burned up
you couldn't walk over it for the cracks in the ground--it was almost
three weeks, you may say, after I'd come up that Mr. Morrisson wrote
word to say he was coming. I'd heard say you was engaged to him, and I
was curious enough to see him. I used to go up of an evening to the
verandah at the homestead after I'd taken a dip in the water--hole--you
remember, miss, the water-hole in the bed of the creek--and let down my
back-hair to dry, I was sitting that way one evening when a gentleman
comes riding up--you may guess who he was--and seems struck of a heap,
like, to see me. And that was just how it all begun. I couldn't but
think a little of him after that. It was like as if he'd been so
pleased and so astonished at finding me there. He couldn't take his
eyes off me at first. And I believed what he told me, miss. I believed
it as if it was Gospel truth. He told me he had been engaged to you
once on a while, but that you wanted to break it off. He said I was the
only person in the world that could console him--and, miss, he spoke
that soft and loving I couldn't help believing him. Father never
thought any harm. So long as Mr. Morrisson was there he'd go off to the
township, or go riding round the fences. He was away two days and a
night once, with a fire that had broken out on the next run and partly
on ours."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Morrisson was in charge, I suppose?" put in Portia, shaking
out the tailor-made dress, and placing it in readiness to put on.</p>

<p>"Yes, he was in charge," said Mary, reluctantly; "and, miss, I did
believe in him then. There was nothing I wouldn't have done for him. I
believe I'd have blacked his boots for him if he'd asked me. But he
didn't. He came down to the cottage, and he got me to go up to the
homestead and dine with him. Me and him all alone. And he told me it
was just like as if we were man and wife already, for we was to go down
to be married the very week after in Melbourne. Oh! I did believe him,
miss. He told me he only didn't speak to father because father'd got it
into his head that he was bound to marry you--and there! I believe my
head was turned. He waited on me at that dinner as if I was a queen;
he'd pour out the champagne for me with his own hands, and he said it
would be always like that. He called me Mrs. Morrisson, and he praised
me up to the skies and, oh! miss, I was a wicked, foolish girl--but
more foolish than wicked, I believe. Well! I've been punished enough
since."</p>

<p>"And afterwards?" asked Portia--her voice sounded dry in her own
ears. "I want to know how you came to leave your home."</p>

<p>"What could I do else?" cried Mary; there was helpless despair in
her accents. "Soon after, I pretended to poor father I must go down to
Melbourne to stop with a board-ship friend. Mr. Morrisson was in
Queensland. He hadn't sent for me as he promised, and I was beside
myself with terror and misery. But he came back before my baby was
born--and, if you'll believe it, miss, father found out what was the
matter--and, miss, it broke his heart. The doctors said afterwards his
heart had always been weak; but that makes no difference--it was I
killed him. Oh! I can't speak of it, miss," she covered her face with
her handkerchief and broke into a fresh wail of anguish. "I've not been
to look after the money or anything, for I feel just as though I'd
murdered him. Well, when my baby was born, Mr. Morrisson let me know
pretty clearly he'd no intention of marrying me, and I hadn't any hold
upon him. I cursed him, I did, in father's name and my own; but he
didn't care for that. He said he'd send me money as long as I gave him
no more trouble--and, perhaps, when his Queensland business was settled
up, he'd think about marrying me, after all. But I must go to America,
he said, where I wasn't known, and he'd send me money and come to join
me later. Well, I had no choice, it seemed. I went off to San Francisco
under the name of Mrs. Morris; but after I'd stayed there eating my
heart out for six weeks or more, I made up my mind to come on home and
wait for him. It seemed more home-like in London--and I had an aunt
here too; but she died before I could join her. I told the woman I was
lodging with in San Francisco to send me on my money and my letters;
but from the day I left I've never heard a word of her or of Mr.
Morrisson either until to-day, and it was only by a chance, when I was
posing--that's what they call it, miss, when you're sitting for your
portrait (not quite your portrait, you know, but to figure in a picture
under anybody else's name)--while I was posing in young Mr. Tolhurst's
studio, miss--ah! that's a gentleman and a Christian, if you like--that
I found out you was going to be married this morning, and who to. I
thought I should have died, miss, on the spot. I took up my baby and I
ran out of the house as though I were mad--Mr. Tolhurst did think I was
mad, I believe--and I ran for a cab and drove all the way to the church
thinking I'd stop the banns; but it was too late, and I got out and ran
straight here."</p>

<p>"But how did you find out? and who told you?" questioned Portia.
"Not Mr. Tolhurst, was it?"</p>

<p>She had turned her face away as she made the inquiry, feigning to be
absorbed once more in the arrangement of her wearing apparel in the
valise.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tolhurst? No, miss. I believe it was Providence. In the picture
he's doing of me--leastways it is me, though he's called it 'News from
the Camp,'--I've got to be sitting reading a newspaper. Many's the time
he's put a paper in my hand before; but, bless you, I never thought o'
looking at what was printed in it. But this morning, of all mornings in
the world, I must needs fix my eyes on the very lines that told about
you and Mr. Morrisson. To be married on the 27th, it said--and there
was the name of the church and all!"</p>

<p>She paused, and for a long time Portia made no comment. What she had
been thinking, however, might almost have been divined by her
expression as she turned her face towards Mary and said slowly:</p>

<p>"It was with the idea of preventing the marriage that you came to
the church, I suppose?"</p>

<p>The other hung her head. "Miss, I was beside myself. To have my baby
branded for base-born all his life--him that's got his father's face,
that it'ud have been a pride and a pleasure to see 'em together--it was
more than I could stand. I ought to have thought about you. Why, when I
came running on here awhile ago, well-nigh out of my mind, I couldn't
tell but what you'd have me put outside the door by the servants. But I
didn't seem to care. Oh, miss, you are a young lady!--you was never in
the way of being tempted as I was, and I don't want to excuse myself;
but I had no mother by me, and Mr. Morrisson he did speak so fair."</p>

<p>She had begun to weep afresh. Tears seemed, indeed, to be the only
relief to the sense of rankling injury that she evidently carried about
with her. Portia compassionated her--and with sincerity--but, at this
moment, she was thinking more of her own case than of Mary's. If
Providence had indeed directed her eyes, as Mary had said, to that
newspaper paragraph, why could it not have happened only just one hour
earlier? She would have had no occasion to play the part of a runaway
wife then. How easily matters might still have been arranged before the
fatal "I will" had been pronounced--before her hand had traced so
unwillingly the unreal, unfamiliar signature of Portia Morrisson in the
book they had set before her. Perhaps Mary's eyes had fallen upon the
paragraph at the very instant when John had uttered aloud his
blasphemous boast. He had dared something more than Providence to take
her away from him, she remembered. In obedience to which form of power
was she going to prove to him now how vain that boast had been? "But I
cannot reason it out at this moment," she reflected hurriedly. "There
is only one thing I am clear about. I must get out of his way as fast
as ever I can."</p>

<p>Her little valise was packed by this time. Her wedding-ring, John's
engagement-ring, and such other costly gifts as he had bought her were
left scattered upon the table. She took her watch, her diamond
earrings, and one or two valuables. Of the fifteen sovereigns which
represented all the money she could lay her hands upon, she pressed
five upon her visitor wherewith to buy a present for the baby.</p>

<p>"And now, Mary," she said in a firm voice, after all these
arrangements were concluded, "I owe you a lifelong debt of gratitude.
You have saved me from taking a step I should have repented more
bitterly than I can say. I am not going away with--with Mr. Morrisson.
I don't look upon him as my husband at all. Go back to your lodgings
now and leave me your address. Mr. Morrisson shall be sent to you
to-day. He is yours, and not mine; and if the law cannot be made to
interfere (which I think it can be), we must act for ourselves. I am
going to some friends--for I must be out of the way; but I shall
contrive to hear how you are getting on, and I will see that justice is
done you. My own marriage is no marriage. Yours is the only real
one"--she stopped short--the phrases in Anna's letter suggested
themselves to her memory. Was there such a thing as real marriage at
all? "Now you had better go; you have carried out the thing you came
for."</p>

<p>"And--and you're not angry, miss," stammered Mary, rising with a
bewildered air. Burning resentment, a bitter desire for vengeance,
hatred towards her betrayer, a deeper hatred perhaps towards her rival,
the woman he was about to marry--all these feelings had held her in
their power as she entered the room. Now they had given way to
astonishment and gratitude. Astonishment, perhaps, was the uppermost
feeling of the two.</p>

<p>That a newly-married bride, on the point of starting off on her
wedding--trip with the bridegroom, should renounce her honeymoon and
her husband as easily as though they had been represented by a
ball-room partner and a round dance, was a phenomenon undreamed of in
her philosophy. What she had intended to bring about by her
denunciation she was not quite clear. Vengeance had been the sentiment
that had mainly dictated her action. She had felt on her way to the
church as a Paris vitrioleuse (if there be such a word) might feel on
her way to blast a hated rival. And here she had been received with
pitying consideration and words of gentlest sympathy. Her rival had not
only taken her by the hand and kindly invited her confidence, but had
actually ceded the place to her. It was inexplicable. Perhaps it was
education that did it. It might not be considered manners in Miss
James's world to show one's feelings upon occasions like the present
one. Nevertheless, before she went away, Mary placed her child for the
second time in Portia's arms. But the gesture that accompanied the
action was as different from the former one as the expression she now
wore on her face.</p>

<p>"I can't say all that's in my mind, miss," she said in trembling
tones; "but won't you give the little one a kiss as a token you've
forgiven me?"</p>

<p>And Portia bent her head, and pressed her pure lips against the
velvety surface of the baby cheek. Then with her own hands she adjusted
Mary's thick veil around the tear-stained face, and after writing down
her address and promising once more that she should have redress, she
prepared to take final leave of her, At the door, however, she detained
her an instant while she said, "One thing I must ask you, Mary--to keep
what has passed this morning a secret between ourselves. You don't tell
Mr. Tolhurst things. I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Tolhurst! Oh, no, miss. He's been a good friend to me--I'll say
that for him; but he's distant-like in his manner."</p>

<p>"Of course," continued Portia, "I have no right to control your
confidences. Only I couldn't bear that my name should be mentioned in
connection with anything that has happened when you are talking
to--to--outsiders, you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I quite understand, miss--and oh, dear! if I thought it would
spoil your life, I'd undo all my morning's work this minute, and
thankfully too."</p>

<p>"It hasn't spoilt my life, Mary," replied Portia, gravely. "On the
contrary. And now good-bye--and take heart; things may still come right
in the end."</p>

<p>She turned back into the room, after watching her visitor departed
down the long corridor that led to a back staircase, whence Mary might
find her way out of the house through the kitchen regions. Whatever
might happen in the future, her appearance this morning had had at
least the effect of exorcising the ghost that had haunted Portia's
imagination so long. Never again would Harry's Madonna fix, as she had
been wont to do of late, her mournful and enigmatic gaze upon her
whenever Portia was alone with her thoughts. Henceforth her mind would
be at rest upon that point. The enigma had been solved. The ghost was
laid. "But I should have heeded the warning while there was time," she
reflected sorrowfully. "Who knows whether my new-born antipathy to
John--that I don't remember feeling in Australia, or how could I have
promised to marry him?--was not dictated by a kind of occult influence,
exercising itself through the painted effigy of the woman who stood,
and who still stands, between us? I have had an instinctive shrinking
from him lately that made me see all his actions in what I thought must
be a distorted kind of light. If he kissed me I felt it was brutal of
him. And how truly my instincts spoke, after all!"</p>

<p>Portia did not, however, allow her reflections to interfere with her
preparations for her departure. She had always had a tendency to dress
and pack, to do most things indeed, rouf-rouf (as the Brussels people
call doing things in a hurry), and the habit stood her in good stead
now. Not six minutes after Mary's departure, she was standing in the
tailor-made dress of grey tweed, upon her head a felt travelling hat
and covered by a gossamer veil as baffling to those who would have
penetrated its folds from the outside, as that of the Veiled Prophet
himself; her keys and her purse in an accessible pocket; her wraps and
her waterproof made into a geometrical bundle, with the aid of Wilmer's
Australian saddle-bag, that had somehow passed into her possession; her
demeanour composed, her mind as clear as though she had been bent upon
no more important mission than that of taking the dogs for a walk. When
all her arrangements were completed, she looked at herself for an
instant in the glass before tying on her veil. Her cheeks were
curiously pale, but there was such a light of fierce excitement in her
eyes, that the rusty stains that marked their yellow--brown depths
seemed to burn and glitter as though they were reflecting some inward
flame. With her veil tied closely over her face, Portia satisfied
herself that she was hardly to be recognized. But the outline, what
painters call the ar abesque of her figure might yet betray her. She
reached down from a peg a long dark cloak, the counterpart of the one
that a certain order of nursing-sisters wear, and threw it over her
shoulders. Her final step was to take a piece of paper and a pencil,
and to write, with a firm hand, the following:</p>

<p>"DEAREST EMMA,--I have not gone mad, and I am not going to kill
myself; but I should do one or the other, perhaps both, if I were
obliged to live with Mr. Morrisson now. I have just discovered that he
has a wife (or a mistress) and a child--the latter not a year old. If I
were to stay here I am afraid I should be forced to go away with him
all the same; so, to avoid a painful scene, I have made up my mind to
leave the house for a time, and to hide somewhere until things are
settled. Don't try to have me followed; it would be of no use--and
don't be uneasy about me. I am of age now, and can do as I please, and
you know that I am well able to take care of myself. You may just fancy
I have gone to the seaside for a week, if you like. You will hear again
from me soon--and meanwhile, with best love to Wilmer and yourself, au
revoir.</p>

<p>"PORTIA."</p>

<p>Within this missive she placed a sealed envelope addressed to John
Morrisson, Esq., inside which she had written in pencil: "If you want
an explanation of my letter to Emma, call at No. 77 Silver
Street.--PORTIA JAMES."</p>

<p>The signature was written with defiant clearness. Like many young
women who are not otherwise distinguished as scribes, Portia had a
signature worthy of a Minister of State. She re-read hurriedly her
letter to her sister. Yes, it would do. There was nothing in its
contents to warrant violent alarm on the part of her belongings. And
now there remained nothing more for her to do but to make her escape,
with the faithful Eliza's aid.</p>

<p>But this part of her project turned out, as the event proved, the
most difficult of all to carry into effect. Upon being called back into
the room, after her curiosity had been roused to a point that was
well-nigh unbearable by the distinct sound of smothered sobs proceeding
from it, nurse Eliza's face wore an air of justifiable resentment. Her
compressed lips plainly told of a slight offered, not only to her
dignity, but to her most intimate feelings--her most tender
susceptibilities. Portia saw how the case stood in a moment, but there
was no time to perform the necessary operation of smoothing nurse Eliza
down before enlisting her services. To do the latter justice, when she
was made finally aware of her young mistress's desperate resolve, and
the cause of it, her own private grievance in connection with the
matter melted away. The magnitude of the news was so infinitely beyond
anything she could have suspected or dreamed of in her wildest moments,
that it seemed to swallow up all other considerations. Upon one point,
however, nurse Eliza was obdurate. If her young lady was bent upon
going--why, she would go with her. In vain, Portia expended herself in
arguments to prove that there was no time for her to get ready in--that
the only real service she could render was by remaining behind and
guarding the room as though its occupant were still there, until such
time as it should be incumbent upon her to betray the secret. The woman
remained inflexible, until, at length, in a moment of desperation,
Portia flew to the window.</p>

<p>"I'll jump out of it," she cried vehemently; "and it will be you who
have killed me. I won't be hunted like an animal."</p>

<p>She had thrown back her veil, and stood like a tigress at bay; her
eyes seemed actually to throw out sparks of fire.</p>

<p>"Oh, miss," sobbed the terrified Eliza, "what are you about? Don't
you know if you was to jump out I'd be after you before you'd get to
the bottom? I'll do what you want; but you'll break my heart, you cruel
girl, that you will."</p>

<p>"They all seem to cry but me," said Portia to herself, as she pulled
down her veil again, and listened in secret triumph to the hysteric
sniffs of distress whereby Eliza found vent for her feelings. But aloud
she cajoled the faithful creature with honeyed words. She promised that
Eliza should be the first to hear her news. "And you shall come and
join me, dear, I am going to friends. My letters will be addressed to
you always, on the condition that you don't betray my whereabouts. I
only don't tell you where I am going, in order that you may not have to
tell a lie--you can't tell lies, you know, Eliza dear--when they ask
you where I am. And now go and see that the coast is clear; that the
door of the smoking-room is shut; that my sister is having a nap; that
the servants are out of the way, and the back-door in the garden open.
Then come and make a sign to me from the end of the corridor. I will
come out with my valise and the saddle-bag, and in High Street I shall
get into the first hansom I see."</p>

<p>And all these directions Eliza, in fear and trembling, carried out
au pied de la lettre. She cleared the path, as one who assists a
prisoner to escape at dead of night from his dungeon. If James or any
one of his silver-blue tribe had a fleeting glimpse of the
nurse-uniform's cloak skurrying down the garden-path--if the groom in
the coachhouse, hosing the wheels of the equipage that was to drive the
newly-married pair to the station, and pondering upon the extent of the
tip he would most probably receive from the bridegroom, caught a
transient view of a figure so like his young mistress's hurrying up the
mews, that he paused to say, "Well, I'm blowed;" there was nothing in
either of these events that need have caused the fugitive alarm.
Nevertheless, it was not when Portia had scuttled through the corridor
and down the backstairs, not when she had left the yard, the garden,
and the garden-door behind her, not even when she had received her
valise at Eliza's hand outside, and had walked undisturbed into High
Street--it was not, indeed, until she was safely ensconced in a
swift--bowling hansom, to the driver whereof she had given the order
"London Bridge Station," that her breath seemed to come freely once
more, and her heart to resume, to a certain extent, its normal
functions. She had accomplished her great coup. She had acted upon the
brave motto "to dare and to do," and she had succeeded. A curious
exhilaration seemed to take possession of her. The world was before
her, and she had her liberty. She might live her own life now, as Anna
had put it, where and how she pleased. It is generally supposed that
there is no case so curious or exceptional but that its counterpart
might be found among the thousand and one curious and exceptional cases
that occur daily in London without anybody's being the wiser for them.
Yet I doubt if, in any other quarter of that vast conglomeration, a
newly-married bride, leaving her home under similar conditions to those
which attended our heroine's departure, and wearing a similar look of
elation in her tell-tale eyes concealed behind her gossamer veil, could
have been readily encountered. And what was our heroine thinking of, as
the cab rolled on its long, smooth course into the City? I think, if
the truth must be told, the route she intended to take to Paris was the
uppermost consideration in her mind during the first few moments of her
flight. "Newhaven and Dieppe," she concluded triumphantly. "They will
never think of that; and I shall be safe in hiding at Anna's before
they have had time to make up their minds in what direction they are to
look for me."</p>

<h3>Chapter XI</h3>

<p>FORTUNE, or perhaps one of those powers that John in his wild
jubilation had defied, favored Portia's flight. Her hansom bowled her
in swift safety to the London Bridge station, where it deposited her an
hour before the departure of her train--which hour she spent waiting in
an obscure corner of the ladies' waiting-room, with her veil down, and
her heart, as the saying goes, in her mouth. She dared not venture upon
the platform outside, where the hurrying crowd was running to and fro
like ants about their nests; she could not even command the resolution
to make her way into the refreshment-room, where, despite her agitation
of mind, she would have been glad to provide herself with one of the
fossil Bath buns displayed upon the counter (for violent emotion and a
long hour's drive incline to emptiness): It was in vain she told
herself that no one would think of looking for her here, and that in so
far as her chances of being recognised went, she had counteracted them
effectually by merging her identity into that of the class of average
young-lady travellers, who flit unperceived about the world with "Come
like shadows, so depart" for their apparent rule of action. Conscience,
that makes cowards of us all, made a coward of Portia. It seemed to her
that everyone who looked in her direction did so with malice prepense,
having detected the fact that she was running away from her home. Even
the man who took the tickets eyed her, as she thought, with suspicion.
The more effectually to screen herself from observation she had taken a
second-class place, and now mounted heroically into a second-class
carriage of the order known as stuffy, and dissimulated herself between
a fat French priest and a little girl on her way to school in France,
who spent her time in alternate fits of weeping and sucking
oranges.</p>

<p>The night was a divine one. Through the window of the compartment,
which her fellow-travellers persisted in keeping closed, Portia could
see the summer landscape fading into indistinctness under the waning
twilight. By-and-by a red-gold moon swung herself slowly aloft through
the sky. What would not Portia have given to be able to stop the train
and walk about in the midst of that enchanted scene? It seemed so
redolent of calm and repose, to breathe such "bease," as Emma had said
of the coppery Claude--and "bease" appeared as far out of Portia's
reach at this instant as the moonlit landscape itself. A thousand
disquieting thoughts were succeeding each other in her brain. A woman
does not run away upon her wedding-day with just the kind of sensation
with which she might start upon a personally-conducted circular tour,
paid for by anticipation--and this was what our heroine was discovering
to her cost. At one moment she would picture the scene that must ensue
when the fact of her flight was discovered: Emma's guttural
ejaculations, Wilmer's nervous manipulation of his monocle, John's
baffled rage--she could imagine it all so vividly. At another she would
ponder upon the possible consequences of her action. She was not at all
sure that she had not placed herself under the ban of the "law of the
land"--a mysterious and vaguely-understood power--nor that the emissary
who would finally capture her might not turn out to be a policeman.
Then, what would Anna say? And how long would it be before her
hiding-place in Paris could be discovered? This last reflection
diverted her mind from dwelling upon the consternation her flight would
necessarily arouse in the home-circle. It is well known that in cases
of family separation the person who goes among fresh surroundings has
less time and less opportunity for fretting than the friends who are
left behind. Such importance, indeed, do we attach to the considering
and sustaining (to say nothing of the detaching influence) of new
surroundings, that even when the destination of the voyager is that
unknown country from whose bourne no traveller returns, we think
ourselves warranted in saying, with a shake of the head: "Ah! it is not
he who is to be pitied, poor fellow! It is those he is leaving
behind."</p>

<p>Portia thought of this fact in connection with her own experience.
The excitement of the journey, the having a definite object in view, a
place where she might be sure of a welcome awaiting her, made her
position a very different one from that of the friends she was leaving
in ignorance of her fate, from whose horizon she was vanishing without
leaving a trace of her passage or a clue to her possible whereabouts.
She promised herself that she would let them have news through Eliza as
soon as she could do so with safety. Mary and her baby were also much
in her thoughts. The mystery of the coincidence that had inspired her
with her first presentiment in connection with them, through Harry
Tolhurst's agency, recurred to her mind. The Madonna picture had faded
away, but the vision of the prototype of that Madonna, weeping over her
shattered life, with her baby at her breast, had taken its place. A
horror of the man she called her husband was Portia's next feeling. "I
am glad I left the opal ring he gave me where Emma will see it and take
it to him," she thought; "that and the wedding-ring will speak more
plainly than any reproaches I could have made him."</p>

<p>What John would do was, however, beyond her power to divine. She
pondered so much upon this question, and so many complicated problems
seemed to spring out of it as regarded the claim Mary had upon his
affection, and the extent to which it would be justifiable to force him
to marry her (if such a thing were possible) after his own inclination
towards her had died out, that she lost herself in the labyrinth. If,
as physiologists tell us, the amount of thinking we go through
increases the convolutions of our brains, and removes us still further
in the scale from our cousins the chimpanzees, Portia's brain must have
acquired many an added twist during her journey from Newhaven over the
sea. Of trouble in getting across she had none. If railway companies
and steamer agencies set out with the express purpose of facilitating
flights and elopements, they could not render the means of
accomplishing them more easy. The theory of swimming, or writing, or of
doing anything else whatsoever "made easy," is nothing to the theory of
travelling made easy as it has been actually carried into effect by
companies; and except for the fact that a traveller is occasionally
launched into eternity, without so much as a "by your leave," through
their operations, the arrangements by which they whisk us about the
world, from London to Timbuctoo, are all, so to speak, plain sailing.
"They must think the passengers are blind or deaf," thought Portia, "to
make it necessary for a man to go on shouting, 'This way for the boat!'
all the time--as if there were anywhere else to go to, if one wanted."
Arrived on board, she had the courage to descend to the second-cass
ladies' cabin, but not the courage to remain there. The elaborate
preparations that the majority of the inmates were making for the
worst, together with the ostentatious display of unbreakable basins on
the berths, was a spectacle before which she shuddered and fled. In
return for a handsome pourboire, a French steward placed a mattress and
a pillow for her on the deck, and there, with the moon's rays casting
their silvery radiance over her, this bride of a day laid herself down
to sleep. It was by no means the first time she had slept thus, under
the stars. She had known in olden times the joys of camping-out in the
Australian bush, when Wilmer had allowed her to accompany him upon a
mustering expedition to a distant part of the run. She knew the
exhilaration of waking in the cool morning, with the vast blue dome of
the far-reaching Australian sky for her only canopy, and the wondrous
chant of the native magpie, wild and sweet as the bush itself, to usher
in her morning visions. She had built many an innocent
castle-in-the--air in those far-away childish days. But in none of them
had she seen herself lying solitary under the starlit sky on her
wedding-night. Now she had no longer anything to fear, she lifted her
veil, and allowed the cool moist air--"charg&eacute; de sels et
d'aromes," as the enigmatic Verlaine has it--to wander over her face.
When a travelling 'Arry approached too near, with inquisitive glances
that spoke of "making up to her," she let it fall again. But she was
not the only lady on the deck. A palpable bride, with her head on her
lord's shoulder, sate in an obscurer patch at some little distance from
her. Portia felt a strange pang as she looked in the direction of the
newly--wedded pair. The silhouette of the bride was vague and
indefinite, yet it bore the stamp of a serenity blissful beyond
expression.</p>

<p>Our heroine, I may remark par parenth&egrave;se, was blessed with
the possession that comes first in the triad of good things popularly
supposed to ensure our earthly happiness. She enjoyed (and if ever the
word "enjoyed" were well applied it is in this connection)--she enjoyed
good health. Not all the thinking she had done during her journey in
the train could render her unmindful of the fact that she had had no
bun after all, stale or otherwise, at London Bridge station, and that
it was a very long time since she had assisted at Emma's
breakfast-lunch--supposed to be a bridal breakfast, too, but more
suggestive of a funeral feast of baked meats, as far as her own
feelings in partaking of it were concerned. And not all her agitation
on the score of her "escapade" could prevent her from thinking the
fresh ham sandwiches and sweet lemonade wherewith she supped on deck
very nice indeed. She lay awake notwithstanding, listening to the swish
swish and thump thump of screw and engine, until the moon was but a
pale reflection of the golden globe that had climbed so majestically up
the heavens a few hours ago. The pale dawn was creeping up from behind
the rim of the quiet ocean. Then Portia fell asleep, and in her sleep
she fancied she was walking in front of the lions' cage at the Zoo. It
was the hour at which the beasts were to be fed, and the particular
lion she was looking at was walking up and down in wild agitation, with
his eyes flaming, his tail curling, and his mouth gaping, uttering
hoarse and hungry howls; she saw the food, a mass of raw and bleeding
flesh, brought close to his cage, and, just as he was springing upon it
wildly, she saw that it was withdrawn by the keeper. The rage of the
lion thereupon was terrific to behold, and it seemed to Portia in her
dream that it was against herself that he was raging. Under the
influence of the horrible fascination exercised upon her in her
nightmare she was constrained to approach the cage, with the full
certainty of being eaten in her turn; but her terror was so great when
she discovered that the lion was turning into John that she awoke. The
boiler was letting off steam, and the lion's howls she had heard in her
dream had been suggested by its hoarse roar. Her cheeks felt cold and
clammy. The harbour of Dieppe, with the masts of the ships at anchor,
and the towers of the grey cathedral swimming in the amber morning
light, were before her. Another six hours, and she would be in Paris
with Anna.</p>

<h3>Chapter XII</h3>

<p>THE day-journey from Dieppe to Paris, though infinitely more
fatiguing, was not, in one sense, as trying to our heroine as her
flight of the previous night. For one thing, she had had the time to
review her position calmly; and even after sleeping over it--a process
which is supposed to be most efficacious in readjusting our mental
focus--she felt that if the thing were to do over again, she would act
in precisely the same way; now as the lives of most of us are made up
of regrets that we could not have acted differently, this was a
conclusion that could not fail to have a tranquillising effect.
Moreover, as regarded the fact of running away, the contempt that is
born of familiarity was beginning to assert its reassuring influence
upon her mind. She no longer imagined that when any of her
fellow-travellers looked her way it must necessarily be with the set
purpose of denouncing her to her relations, and was even composed
enough after a while to look through the window of the high and jolting
second-class carriage into which she had climbed, and to admire the
landscape, after an abstracted and desultory fashion, in the calm,
clear sunshine of a July day. The woods and fields, twinkling with
light, reminded her of a newly-varnished picture. The words in which
Mark Twain, in the Innocents Abroad, emphasises the refrain, "Oh,
pleasant land of France," by adding "and it is a pleasant land,"
recurred to her memory, and she felt that she could fully indorse them.
The crops were a particular source of wonder and delight. The sloping
fields of wheat, a rippling expanse of pale gold set round with a
garland of fiery poppies and sky-blue cornflowers, excited her
admiration, I fear, even more than the grey towers of Rouen Cathedral,
which also claimed her passing notice. But Portia was, as we have seen,
a Bushbred maiden, and she had not grown up in the midst of the farming
operations carried on at Yarraman Station upon the virgin soil of
Australia--so parched and dried up for the most part of the year, that
"elderly spinster soil" would have been a more applicable designation
for it--to be oblivious, when she beheld them, of the marvels of an
unbroken succession of fields of waving corn waiting in all their
ripened glory for harvesting. Then there were the trees--the wonderful
European trees--with their rich and varying liveries of heavy summer
green, to be contrasted with her recollection of the gaunt Australian
gums and the black and scraggy she--oaks she remembered. Her
reflections upon these topics were, however, more of the nature of
passing impressions than an actual exercise of her cogitative
faculties, for the part that she herself was to play in her new
surroundings was the consideration that was really uppermost in her
mind most of the time. She had wisely, but not too well, as regarded
her own comfort, taken refuge in the ladies' carriage, where for all
society she found only two religieuses and an exclusive lady's-maid,
with whom she hardly exchanged a word all the way. Arrived at the Gare
St. Lazare, she had a momentary quailing in presence of the unfamiliar
and somewhat formidable crowd that thronged in its vicinity. In the
Bush, she was fully able, in the literal sense of the phrase, to find
her way about; but to accomplish a similar feat, in the slang
acceptation of the words, and in a city like Paris, of all others,
seemed quite another matter. There were women here, too, with that in
their faces that dismayed her--she could not tell why--and the hot
colour mounted to her cheeks upon more than one occasion as her eyes
encountered behind her veil those of some Frenchman who was trying to
d&eacute;visager her (the fact that we have no equivalent for the word
in English is a proof that the habit is more of a Continental than an
insular one). It was with a sigh of relief that she deposited herself
at last, with rugs and valise, in the petite voiture that was to drive
her to the Rue Vaugirard. Was it fancy, or had the cocher in the
polished white belltopper, to whom she had just confided herself,
really intended to leer at her with insolent meaning as she gave him
the address? The idea was such a disquieting one that she stopped him
before they had rolled many yards to inquire of him, in timid
Australian-French, whether he had understood where he was to take her.
The cocher replied, "Parfaitement," with a shrug and in a testy tone of
voice, as though he had been annoyed by her asking; but this was so
much more reassuring than his previous way of conducting himself, that
Portia began to think she must have misjudged him after all, and that
her first impression was the result of pure nervousness.</p>

<p>It was not the first time that our heroine had been in Paris. She
had been brought thither, as we have seen, only a fortnight ago, for
the solemn purpose of making choice of her going-away bonnet. The
difference between that mission and her actual one was not less great
than the difference between the Paris she had known then and the Paris
she was to come into contact with now. During her former visit she had
stayed at the H&ocirc;tel Continental, and had seen from her windows
the same trim and beautiful portion of the Tuileries gardens opposite,
as the deposed Queen Zara, in Daudet's Rois en Exil, saw the morning
after her hasty arrival. The Paris she had known then had been that
glittering surface of the great city which draws to itself the rich,
the young, the gay, and the pleasure-loving of all the nations upon
earth. It was the Paris of the grands boulevards, the
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais, the Op&eacute;ra,
Br&eacute;bants, and the Palais Royal. From her short experience of it,
Portia had gathered the impression that existence here meant being
steeped to the neck in every kind of agreeable and delightful
sensation. She had a clear remembrance of sitting under the awning of a
well-know caf&eacute; on the Boulevard Poissoni&eacute;re with Wilmer
and John, eating sorbets, and of looking across the intensely
interesting crowd of carriages and pedestrians that streamed past her,
to the houses on the opposite side. How grandly high they rose above
the topmost boughs of the beautiful limes and chestnuts and sycamores
standing in front of them, and what a gay surface of golden letters
picked out on a soft grey background they presented to her gaze. Many
different families, people of all ranks and callings, she had been
told, dwelt in layers in these marvellous habitations, sinking in the
social scale as they rose in the architectural one; but she could
hardly realise this fact. Like the hero in Thackeray's sketch in the
little dinner at Timmins's, who imagined that the pastry-cooks' young
ladies at whose shrine, or, rather, at whose counter, he worshipped,
must be nurtured upon the most delicate of intangible dainties, upon
whiffs and emanations of creams and jellies, she could not help
connecting the mingled perfumes she was conscious of--those of the
hyacinth-laden flower-cart that passed along in front of her, of the
patchouli-scented cocolte (whom she took for a charming lady) seated
next to her, of the sauce piquante that was being fabricated in the
kitchen of a celebrated restaurant at hand--with the lives of the
dwellers in these enchanted regions. The atmosphere they lived in
harmonised with the brilliancy of their surroundings. For Portia they
were all part of a brilliant show. The whole of Paris, indeed,
presented itself to her mind, so far, in the guise of a grand
theatrical display, and the thought of living in it as Anna's guest
took no more definite shape than that of helping to swell the pageant
as she had done before, by driving to the Bois, along the Champs
Elys&eacute;es, or sitting in front of the Caf&eacute; Riche or the
Maison Dor&eacute;, or making purchases in one of those wonderful shops
with the delicately-painted ceilings, where the dame or demoiselle de
magasin would serve her with the most exquisite urbanity, and show her
the loveliest derni&egrave;res creations, maintaining at the same time
her own right of pronouncing the final verdict--"Voila ce qu'il faut
pour Mademoiselle"--with an inflexible calmness of conviction against
which it would have been futile to protest.</p>

<p>This Paris of Portia's recollection was but a limited Paris, after
all. Nevertheless, it is the only one of which the majority of her sex
placed under similar circumstances have much knowledge. For the first
part of her drive there was nothing to dispel her illusions. The cab
drove down the asphalted Rue de Richelieu, and across the narrow and
crowded Rue St. Honor&eacute;, coming, however, to a standstill in the
Rue de Rivoli, where the driver sacr&eacute;'d at having to back before
a tremendous Crichy-Od&eacute;on omnibus, with its three white classic
steeds, worthy of figuring upon a Pompeian frieze, harnessed abreast.
When the omnibus had gone on its way she found herself rattled, with
much clatter, across the stony Place de Carrousel, whence she could
discern ahead of her, to the right, the lower portion of the skeleton
frame-work of the mighty Eiffel Tower, then in process of construction.
The thick mass of foliage in the Tuileries Gardens, and the ascending
perspective of the Champs Elys&eacute;es, with its double rows of trees
and its moving mass of carriages, evoked familiar memories. It was not
until the cocher had driven her across the Pont des Arts, and was
whipping his horse up the Rue de Seine in a fashion which led her to
remonstrate with him in reckless French, that her surroundings began to
wear an unfamiliar aspect. Once, and only once, had Portia crossed the
river before--upon the occasion of her accompanying Emma upon a
shopping expedition to the Bon March&eacute;. The old part of Paris,
that no Cook's tourist would be allowed to neglect--Notre-Dame, the
Tour St.--Jacques, the Pantheon, the Luxembourg--were all unknown to
her. The Quartier Latin was terra incognita. The appearance of the
Boulevard St.--Germain raised the temporary hope that here, perhaps,
the enchanted region would begin to unfold itself once more; but, as
the cab continued its jolting away up the stony Rue de Rennes, the hope
died gradually away. If she had an objection to formulate to this part
of Paris it was on the score of its being so noisy. Omnibuses came
thundering along with a rackety sound that seemed to go through her
head. Carts and carriages rattled over the stones with an aggressive
and deafening clatter. How people carried on the business of
life--above all, how they carried on any kind of connected conversation
in the midst of such a din, was a mystery. No wonder they bawled and
squalled when they spoke to each other. And as though they did not get
share enough of the noise indoors, they seemed to carry on the greater
part of their business outside. How different were the magasins from
those she remembered on the grands boulevards. Their contents seemed to
sprawl not only "all over the shop," but all over the pavement as well.
Even the mantles and costumes were displayed upon portly wicker
presentments of the feminine form ranged in the street outside, and
groceries, crockery-ware, and market produce of all kinds overflowed
upon the trottoir.</p>

<p>Portia was a little tired. The reaction following upon her exciting
experiences of the last four-and-twenty hours was exerting its
depressing influence. The noise, the heat, the dust, and the glare
oppressed her, and though she had remained dry-eyed as a Medusa under
all the emotions consequent upon her marriage and her subsequent flight
from her home, I will not answer for it that as the cab drew up in
front of a shabby wooden door, opening upon a paved courtyard, wherein
a fat, hard-eyed woman, white-jacketed and blue-aproned, sat shelling
peas, she did not feel a kind of unreasoning inclination to shed a
desolate tear or two.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Ross?" she inquired timidly, as she entered the yard
with her valise and her rugs, after she had submissively handed to the
cocher the five francs he claimed from her--the last that remained out
of the pound she had changed at Dieppe. She was perfectly aware that
the man had cheated her; but how was she to defend herself against
extortionate charges in an unfamiliar tongue?</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Ross est sortie," said the woman, shortly. And now
there could be no longer any concealment of the humiliating fact. It
was an actual tear--just such a one as she had shed the first night it
had happened to her to sleep away from home as a little girl--that was
trembling on her lashes and forcing its way down her cheek. The house
in which Anna lived was a so-called maison de derri&egrave;re, and to
Portia's unaccustomed eyes it looked sadly shabby. It was very tall--at
least five or six storeys high, she thought--and the windows upon each
storey were as large as those at a photographer's. In the centre of the
yard, in front, was a small railed-round garden, poor as regarded its
blooms, but rich in the possession of a drooping mountain ash, with
berry-hung branches that swept the ground. This tree gave the only
relieving touch, in Portia's eyes, to the dismalness of the scene. She
remembered that Anna had promised to give her the liberty of her rooms
should she appear unexpectedly upon the scene, and that it was an
understood thing that the key should be left for her with the
concierge. But the woman eyed her with such sharp curiosity, and there
was so little sympathy expressed in her hard face, that our heroine
lost countenance. It was only the desperation of her case that
emboldened her to ask as best she could at what time Mademoiselle Ross
might be expected to return.</p>

<p>"Ne m'a pas dit," muttered the woman, indifferently.</p>

<p>Then Portia bethought herself of taking a visiting-card from her
pocket and showing it, after reading which the concierge, holding up
her peas in her apron, went grudgingly into the lower room of a
building near the entrance, and returned with the key. This room, from
the cursory glance that Portia bestowed upon it, appeared to serve in
the threefold capacity of kitchen, bedroom, and dwelling-room, and to
be equally trim and tidy in all three. In handing her the key, the
woman informed her briefly, "Au quatri&egrave;me premi&egrave;re porte
en face--et tournez deux fois la clef," nodding meanwhile in the
direction of the tall, prison-like house on the other side of the
court. "Au quatri&egrave;me" and "premi&egrave;re porte en face!"--the
words meant nothing to the person to whom they were addressed. Yet
rather than run the risk of again exciting the displeasure of the
concierge, who she felt for some reason or other manifestly disliked
and distrusted her, Portia made her way unaided towards the door that
had been pointed out to her, and, finding herself at the foot of a
carpetless, sombre, not over-clean, and somewhat steep winding
staircase, began to climb the same, valiantly dragging as best she
could, her valise and her rugs up with her. Arrived at the second
landing she was fain to sit down to rest. The whole experience seemed
like a hideous dream. Where, upon this gloomy, prison-like flight of
stairs, could be the door that opened into her friend's abode? Sitting
wearily on a step upon the landing, and reflecting that there was
nothing for it but to retrace her tired steps again (only, could she
dare to leave her portmanteau and her rugs unprotected on the
staircase?), Portia was just about to descend once more, when a door
behind her was opened, and a young man, wearing corduroy trousers and a
plum-coloured, close fitting jersey that sat easily upon his well-knit
figure, emerged from it. A glance was sufficient to prove to Portia
that she was in the presence of a gentleman. The intruder would have
bowed and gone past her, but something helpless and pleading in her
manner of returning the salutation made him pause.</p>

<p>"Are you going higher?" he asked her in English. "Pray let me help
you up with your things."</p>

<p>"I am looking for Miss Ross," said Portia. She had accepted his help
as naturally as he had offered it. "I don't know where to find her
rooms. She left the key for me with her concierge"--producing it as she
spoke. "I am her friend, you know."</p>

<p>It seemed to her that some explanation was due for thus descending
(or rather, ascending) upon another person's abode in her absence; but
her new acquaintance seemed to regard the proceeding as perfectly en
r&egrave;gle.</p>

<p>"That is all right," he said. "She is two &eacute;tages higher." And
he began to precede her up the staircase, carrying her valise and the
bundle.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't think of letting you take so much trouble," protested
Portia, toiling after him.</p>

<p>"No trouble at all," he laughed; "I am only sorry I didn't meet you
at the bottom."</p>

<p>He was a young man, and he had a pleasant face: such a face as may
be seen among the crew of a University eight, or the members of a
cricket team at Lord's, with the refined jaw and well-trained
muscles--facial as well as bodily--that speak of much mental and
physical training. He apologised for going in front, on the ground of
having to show his companion the way, and it was he who placed the key,
after what seemed to Portia an interminable climb, in the door for her,
when they arrived eventually in front of Anna's room, and who gave her
a practical illustration of what the "deux fois tourner" signified. He
even carried her things unasked inside, and, seeing a huge tin
water-jug standing empty at the entrance, took it up with the remark,
"They have forgotten to leave you any water, I see," and was off and
down the stairs and out of sight before Portia, in her bewilderment,
had found any words in which to remonstrate with him. While he was away
she took a hasty glance round the apartment. The first rapid impression
it conveyed was one of new perplexity, and there had been so much to
perplex her already. It was large. Portia, in common with her sex, was
no appraiser of proportions, but it was what she would have called a
fairly big room, and it was high--higher than any of the rooms, not
excepting the picture-gallery itself, in the Kensington mansion. There
was a faded blue curtain slung across one end, behind an opening in
which she could discern a camp bedstead, a washing-stand, and a
wardrobe. The other part of the room seemed to serve as a sitting-room
and studio combined--to say nothing of eating and cooking-room as well.
There was, nevertheless, something attractive in its general aspect.
The floor was of stained wood, with Turkey carpets and rugs scattered
about it. There was a piano on one side and book-shelves on the other.
Upon a low table, in the neighbourhood of a large easel stood a Benares
vase filled with peonies in full bloom, with petals that looked like
frayed rose-colored silk. There were some royal stuffs--Portia did not
know of what description--thrown across a low canopy. In one corner was
a red crock, out of which the end of a loaf as long as an umbrella was
protruding. Against the walls were pinned or nailed all manner of
paintings, drawings, and sketches. Some of these were charcoal studies
from the nude, and to Portia, who did not as yet know the meaning of
"Academies," they conveyed a startling and almost terrifying
impression. She was still standing with the uneasy air of one who does
not know what to make of her surroundings, when her gentleman-help
returned, with the jug filled to the brim.</p>

<p>"They pretend it's eau sur tous les &eacute;tages," he remarked
parenthetically as he set it down; "but it's humbug, one always has to
go to the premi&egrave;re for it. Now; is there nothing else I can do
for you?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed; and I can't thank you enough," declared Portia,
earnestly.</p>

<p>She had come out upon the landing, and with her veil thrown back,
her face a little burned by the sun, and her eyes enlarged, by fatigue
and excitement, looked even more striking than of custom.</p>

<p>"You know Miss Ross, I suppose," she asked hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"I've known her since I moved into the atelier below. I have a
studio here with a friend, and we go into her rooms sometimes--he and
I--in the evening, when we're feeling down about our work."</p>

<p>"About your work?" repeated Portia, interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Yes; we get discouraged sometimes, and we make each other worse.
Then we go to Anna Ross. You may be sure of hearing the truth from
her--about that and everything else. She's great fun, too, don't you
think? Are you going to work with her?"</p>

<p>"Oh no; I don't think so; I can't draw even," said Portia; and,
confused by the recollection of all she had seen in her friend's room
she half extended her hand in token of farewell. "I'll tell Anna how
you came to my assistance."</p>

<p>"Oh, we're always assisting each other in this community," he
laughed. "Tell Miss Ross I'm expecting my friend over in a few weeks;
but that I shall be very lonely until he comes. You won't forget, will
you, to impress that fact upon her?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Portia, diffidently. She was conscious that she was
blushing, and both the fact and the consciousness of it were equally
annoying to her. The result of her annoyance was that she withdrew her
hand, and bestowed a stiff little bow upon her gentleman-help, as he
turned to descend the staircase, instead of the cordial hand-shake with
which she had felt impelled a moment ago to mark her sense of her
gratitude towards him.</p>

<h3>Chapter XIII</h3>

<p>AN hour later, after Portia had performed her ablutions with the aid
of the water brought her by her self-constituted help (it was the
famous eau de la Vanne, as pure and soft as freshly-fallen rain), and
had seated herself with a towel around her shoulders for the further
refreshment of a brushing and combing of her beautiful hair, streaming
in undulating profusion down her back, she was aware of a step coming
up the stairs with a slow pounding footfall that seemed to denote that
the owner of it was very tired, but refused to acknowledge the fact. It
must be Anna, she reflected, straightening herself expectantly upon her
chair; and Anna it was in truth. Before the friends meet, however, it
may be as well to inform the reader, in two words, who and what this
acquaintance of our heroine's was.</p>

<p>She was not in any case what the French call la premi&egrave;re
venue, for in her person, as in her mind, Anna Ross possessed a strange
and strongly marked individuality. Scientific people declared her to be
simply a curious instance of atavism. Belonging to a good English
county family of the most approved, fair-skinned, conventional,
Church-and-State-respecting type, she had performed at a very early age
the feat known in equine metaphor as that of "kicking over the traces."
Not all the combined influences of family, county, Church and State,
pressing with their united force upon this one little rebel could force
her into the mould--a very bed of Procrustes in its way--that social
usage had prepared for her. Her very appearance--her sisters were all
of the blonde and lymphatic type--was a kind of defiance hurled at her
progenitors. Even in her childish days it was impossible to look at her
without thinking of an Indian squaw--if one could imagine such a thing
as an intellectual squaw--and the likeness seemed to become more
accentuated as she grew older. There was the coarse, jet-black, heavy
hair, growing low upon a narrow forehead, and parting naturally in the
middle; there was the high cheekbones and the unmistakable aquiline
nose; there were the black eyes that contracted, all unconsciously,
into a narrowing line when their owner was interested or excited; and,
to crown all, there was the swarthy, un-English skin. The lips in
repose said little. Their prevailing expression was one of strongly
exercised self-repression. They could bend into curves that were both
tender and cruel as occasion demanded. The figure was of the supple,
untrammelled order--not tall and not daintily waisted, but flexible and
muscular. It was known that on the mother's side Anna descended in a
direct line from an English officer who had fought in the war with
America, and who had contracted an alliance &agrave; la mode du pays,
with a Chocktaw or Chickasaw belle. On his return to England he had
been accompanied by a strange-eyed little girl, to whom he had given
the name and privileges of a daughter, and who certainly resembled him
sufficiently to warrant the appellation. It had been supposed, however,
at the end of several generations, of which each succeeding one had
grown fairer and more English than the last, that the alloy of savage
blood must now have had filtering enough through English veins to
prevent the risk of any such catastrophe occurring as that known to
breeders as a "throw back," when Anna's disconcerting identity set all
these calculations at naught. From her babyhood she remained a thorn in
the side of her family, and as soon as she reached woman's estate she
left her home for good. The pittance she received from her relatives,
who strongly condemned her course of life, was just sufficient to
relieve their consciences from the stigma of allowing her to die of
starvation. She earned, however, a little by her brush. In age she
might have been anything between five-and-twenty and five-and-thirty.
The contrast of her black hair and eyes with her sallow skin, and a
certain undefinable magnetic attraction that she possessed to a
remarkable degree, caused her to be a good deal noticed when she walked
in the streets of Paris. She wore a masculine jacket, with a dark hat
and veil, and a close-fitting short skirt in all seasons. Her hands and
feet were models. They were, indeed, the only points in connection with
her personal appearance upon which she might be said to display the
smallest symptoms of coquetry. Indifference and stolidity were the
qualities she aimed at cultivating outwardly, and she was rarely
betrayed into manifesting the least token of pleasure or surprise.</p>

<p>This, as she appeared to the outside world, was the young woman who
now opened the door of the studio where Portia was seated. In her right
hand she carried a paper bag that obviously contained butter. In her
left, her paint-box, a three-legged folding-stool, and an immense bunch
of freshly gathered poppies. Upon beholding her visitor her black brows
showed a transitory, almost imperceptible elevation.</p>

<p>"I thought it might be you," she said; "the concierge told me 'une
demoiselle' had taken the key. No," as Portia rose to greet her, "don't
speak to me till I have put the butter into water."</p>

<p>She swept past, and dived under a cupboard for a crock of water,
into which she tossed her butter. Then scooping up a handful of
rock-salt from a receptacle at hand, she scattered it over the
contents. Her eyes travelled over the crock containing the loaf. "Mice
again!" she said briefly; "I must give them another dose. I hate myself
for doing it, but Rousky says they're in a very low stage of
development as mice, and it's only helping them on to something better.
I'm not sure, though, I should care to be helped on in that particular
way--improved off by poison. Well!" she turned round to her visitor,
"let me wish you the bien venue," and, bending down, she kissed the
young girl gravely between the eyes. Portia would have thrown her arms
about Anna's neck, but the latter repulsed her with a firm, though
kindly, hand.</p>

<p>"There, sit down, my dear," seating herself at the table opposite to
her, and regarding her with attentive eyes. "You mayn't know it, but
you're much prettier than you used to be--and, good gracious! child,
why didn't you tell me you had such hair? It's marvellous. I'll make a
sketch of you like that tomorrow--An Impenitent Magdalen. No, that
wouldn't do! A Potential Magdalen. Is that better? Your hair is
wonderful--and what a colour! Simple as you stand there, as the Irish
say, you could make a fortune as a model; but I must have first choice.
By the bye, I had your telegram yesterday, so I hardly expected you
to-day. I thought your fate was sealed. I'm glad you thought better of
it at the last."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll say I thought worse of it when you hear all,"
said Portia. She essayed to speak lightly, but her lips were trembling
visibly. "I was married yesterday."</p>

<p>"And you've managed to get rid of your husband already! Bravo! you
must tell me how you did it. I shouldn't mind being married myself on
those terms. It's an exact illustration of what Rousky was saying the
other night. The ideals are only perfect, he said, as long as they
remain ideals. If you try to introduce facts into them you spoil them.
Monarchy without a monarch, religion without a god, and marriage
without a husband. That would be perfect! But tell me how you did
it?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you all," said Portia, gravely, "if you'll only be
serious, Anna. It's a thing I can't help being matter-of-fact about
myself, for I mind it so much; and then I'm matter-of-fact about most
things. I want you to help me in two ways--to hide me away first, and
then to advise me about what I'd better do next."</p>

<p>"Well, you must tell me first. Meanwhile, I'll make you some tea.
But don't put your hair up on any account; I want to study an
effect."</p>

<p>She went to the broad windows and drew aside one of the curtains.
The afternoon sun came pouring through the pane, scattering gilt and
bronze over Portia's pendent locks, and framing her head in a nimbus of
amber light. "There, that'll do. Now, don't stir from where you are,
and you can talk on while I'm making the tea."</p>

<p>It was pleasant to Portia to watch Anna's movements as she performed
this housewifely office. Her hands were unlike any she had ever seen
before. There was a deftness and celerity in their way of going to work
that spoke of the long apprenticeship they must have had. Never had tea
tasted so delicious in all her experience as this first cup of Anna's
making. And the delicate rounds of pain de gruau spread with the
unequalled Paris butter! If Anna would only let her live altogether
upon such fare as this, she would ask for nothing better. She felt
ashamed that it should be possible for her to like it all so well, at
the very moment when she was about to unfold a tale of wrong and error
and suffering--the narrative of three wrecked lives, her own among the
number. Anna, however, obliged her to speak, and it was in obedience to
her request that she narrated from beginning to end the chapter of her
life's history that we know.</p>

<h3>Chapter XIV</h3>

<p>"YOU'VE done the best thing you could do under the circumstances,"
was Anna's verdict when Portia had come to an end of her story. "Even
according to benighted Catholic laws I believe you would be able to get
a divorce. And I suppose a divorce is the only solution of the
difficulty you would care about."</p>

<p>"The only one," said Portia, firmly. "I can see you think it was
shockingly weak-minded of me to let myself be married at all with such
a feeling as I had. But I used to care for John at one time--at least,
I always believed I did. And then, how could I have imagined he was
deceiving me?"</p>

<p>"I should not have waited for that to give him his cong&eacute;, if
I had been you. To believe one has cared for a person at some time or
another is rather a lukewarm sentiment to start marriage upon, don't
you think? I suppose you thought if there was no great love in the
beginning, 'heaven may decrease it upon better acquaintance.' Well, you
are safe out of his reach now, at any rate! You don't imagine they
would ever think of looking for you here?"</p>

<p>"Never! They don't even know you are in Paris. But, oh! Anna, I feel
so lost I don't know what I am going to do."</p>

<p>"Do! I'll find you plenty to do. Never fear. You've been nothing but
a summer insect till now. I suppose you only thought of gadding about
amusing yourself all the time you were in London."</p>

<p>"Not much else. There was the riding in the morning, and sometimes
in the afternoon; and Emma always liked me to go shopping or visiting
with her. And when we were not at balls, there were theatres or
concerts. It was all pleasure from morning to night."</p>

<p>"Well, it won't be all pleasure here, then, I can tell you," said
Anna, grimly. "At least, not that kind of pleasure--though, for the
matter of that, such a life as you have been describing would be
hateful to me."</p>

<p>"I was getting a little tired of it too," admitted Portia. "It was
awfully nice, but somehow it always seemed to lead to nothing."</p>

<p>"You may say that of existence altogether, as Rousky does," put in
Anna.</p>

<p>"Who is the Rousky you are always quoting?" asked Portia. "Last time
I saw you it was a Wiluski who was the oracle. You used to tell me so
much about his ideas."</p>

<p>"Did I?" There was a momentary inexplicable gleam in Anna's black
eyes, accompanied by an enigmatic half smile, more sardonic than
mirthful. "I had forgotten. It must be some time back. I don't know
where Wiluski is now. But to come back to you own affairs. I can't
faire des phrases--I never could; but you had better know, once for
all, that I consider your coming to me about the most gratifying
compliment you could have paid me. You are going to let me be
responsible for you for the present? I should like to teach you how to
depend upon yourself a little, so that you won't risk marrying only for
the sake of pleasing other people another time. You haven't brought any
money with you, I hope?"</p>

<p>"N--no; a few pounds only."</p>

<p>"It's more than you want. If you had come as a rich person I
shouldn't have let you stay. We don't admit riches here. We don't
tolerate the &eacute;picier element among us, excepting when we have a
picture to sell. You'll be able to earn as much money as you need."</p>

<p>"I earn money!" exclaimed Portia, with shame-faced pleasure in her
looks. "I never earned a penny in my life. I shouldn't know how!"</p>

<p>"Then it's more than time you began. You may pose for the t&ecirc;te
d'expression first of all, and for your hair, and your neck, and your
arms, et puis nous verrons! It's tiring work at first; but you'll get
into it. And now I must clear out a corner of the atelier for you to
sleep in to-night. To--morrow we can find a room somewhere, if you're
not comfortable. And you'll have to come to dinner with me at Clootz's
to-night. It's quite close at hand."</p>

<p>"Whatever you like," assented Portia. She had put herself entirely
into Anna's hands, and was perfectly content to abide by her decision
in all things; to surrender to her even that newly-found liberty which
she had deemed it so great a privilege to obtain. It was a relief under
the present circumstances to be saved from the responsibility of
thinking and acting for herself. As for measuring the distance that
separated Anna's way of living from the way in which Wilmer and Emma
lived--the way in which she herself and all the Kensington household
had lived as well--these were considerations that could have no kind of
weight with her. Portia's mind was of a plastic mould, and she was
still at a plastic age. To find herself in a luxurious English home one
day, and to have to share a single room on a Paris quatri&egrave;me
with a friend the next, was a contrast of which she was more likely to
see the amusing than the inconvenient side. When she found that Anna
possessed a tub, and that the antagonistic concierge filled it nightly
with the beautiful eau de la Vanne; also that she might hire a similar
luxury for herself, all misgivings as regarded her new local were done
away with. Anna, moreover, was a woman of fertile contrivances. To see
her transform a cumbersome-looking easy-chair into a couch and wheel it
behind the faded blue curtain, whisk off an extra mattress from her
camp bedstead and place it upon the couch, unstrap Portia's rugs and
arrange the coverlet and pillows comfortably thereupon; clear out
drawers and placards for her to put her things into, set the
fast-dropping poppies in water and shake them out into the full display
of their crimson glories, wash up the cups and saucers, and sprinkle
her charcoal sketches with fixatif before putting them by in her
portfolio, was to be impressed anew with a profound sense of her
neat-handedness and orderliness. In this, at least, she showed none of
the ancestral tendencies; or possibly the military precision of the
husband of the squaw had counteracted in his descendants the
laisseraller principle of savage races as regards domestic
arrangements.</p>

<p>"I'm doing nothing to help you," said Portia, at last. She had been
partly gazing out of the window into the courtyard below, that looked a
terrific way down, partly watching her friend's operations in naive and
wondering admiration. "You should give me something to do, Anna."</p>

<p>"Oh; you must be content to fill a decorative r&ocirc;le for to-day.
You'll have all your work cut out for you soon, I can tell you. Now I'm
going to do your hair for you as I like it."</p>

<p>And to this also Portia submitted, and gratefully And by the time
the red--gold coil was twisted in Cingalese fashion behind her head,
where, to her astonishment, Anna fixed it with a solitary silver arrow,
it was time to go to dinner.</p>

<p>"You needn't put on your cloak," Anna told her, and Portia, all
unconscious that her friend had designs of showing her off,
submissively did as she was ordered. Descending the four flights of
stairs and passing through the courtyard, where they did not meet a
soul, Anna conducted her through unknown streets to Clootz's.</p>

<p>This famous restaurant to which Portia was introduced was of a kind
much frequented by students and artists of the Quartier Latin, those
who were ranged in the category of les petites bourses. In later days
they would probably refer to Clootz's as "une gargote"; but in their
actual necessitous days--before they had, in their own vocabulary,
"arrived"--they were very glad to assemble at the small tables in the
small, smoke-filled dining--room--at one end of which the restaurateur
and his wife carried on their cooking operations in full view of the
customers--and there dine off a potage and the plat du jour, or some
similar luxury, for the not too extortionate sum of one franc or a
franc and a half, with occasional credit for the same when funds were
low. English and American artists of both sexes favoured Clootz's. The
fare, to be sure, was not very delicate, but the "portions" were more
liberal than at a Duval's, and the publicity of the cooking was a
guarantee against the harbouring of sundry dark suspicions that are apt
to trouble the appetites of the frequenters of one-franc restaurants.
Besides which, there was always the option of dining &agrave; la
carte--a person with extravagant tastes and an inordinate appetite
might spend from three to four francs at Clootz's--and for an extra
halfpenny you might have a clean cloth to cover the stained marble in
front of you. There was only room for four people at each table, and
even so the fit was rather a tight one. But anybody who was an
habitu&eacute; was sure to encounter friends enough at Clootz's to make
up a table of his own; and in that case it was an advantage to make
exchanges of half-plates of petits pois or flageolets with one's
neighbours, by which means you were enabled to vary the menu, and have
quite a number of different plats for your twenty or five-and-twenty
sous.</p>

<p>Portia had been to the Maison Dor&eacute;, and had dined at the
Continental and the Grand Hotel, but she had never seen a restaurant of
this kind before. She tried not to think that it was rather "awful"
(though this, I fear, was the adjective that would have most nearly
expressed her secret feelings) as she followed her friend up the
crowded room to a table near the cooking end, where the restaurateur--a
fat Alsacien, in a white paper cap--was shaking potatoes in a
frying-pan over his stove. Seated next to Anna, she saw that people
were looking round at them in various directions, and that here and
there a head would bow recognition. The atmosphere was impregnated with
cigar-smoke, and one did not require to be a connoisseur, any more than
Portia was, to feel (as she did) that it had not the fragrance of the
atmosphere she had been accustomed to when Wilmer and his friends were
smoking. Anna acknowledged the various bows she received by stately
little nods. She had turned back her veil square across her forehead,
and, sitting in the shade, in her masculine jacket, with her jet-black
hair, her sallow skin, and the curious contour of her face, bore an odd
resemblance to the effigy of an Egyptian Pharaoh as handed down to us
in the paintings on some old-world sarcophagus. After a time Portia
became aware that somebody was bowing to her, and for an instant her
heart stood still. But it was only her "gentleman-help," seated among a
group with whom he was engaged in an apparently animated discussion.
His bow in her direction caused the others to look at her for the first
time, and, placed as she was, she could not help being conscious that
they were asking him questions about her.</p>

<p>Anna, meanwhile, had been giving her orders to the gar&ccedil;on, a
country--bred youth fresh from his pays, with a face as unlike the
cynical mask of the typical gar&ccedil;on as possible. Bouillon with a
powdering of fromage rap&eacute;, t&ecirc;te de veau &agrave; l'huile,
haricots verts, and cr&egrave;me suisse, composed the menu she
submitted gravely to her companion's approval. Portia declared her
readiness to like whatever Anna did. Her tastes were eclectic--a
consequence, no doubt, of that plasticity of temperament and of age
already referred to, which was one of her prominent qualities. She
persuaded herself therefore, that the better portion of the ear of a
cold calf's-head, soused in oil, and plentifully besprinkled with
chopped onions, was the most delectable diet in the world, and was only
sorry she could not honestly like the vin ordinaire, that seemed to
have such a taste of ink, which Anna continued to press upon her.</p>

<p>Between the intervals that followed the arrival of the "portions"
(and they were very long ones, the country-bred gar&ccedil;on being the
only aid that the restaurateur and his wife allowed themselves), Portia
learned a good deal respecting the company at Clootz's. Her
"gentleman-help" had had, it seemed, a landscape in the Salon. He had
colour, but was no draughtsman, and would have to "piocher" a good
deal, in Anna's opinion, before he could come to the front. The group
he was with was made up of three American artists and one Australian.
They were all in the atelier of Jean Paul Laurens, and one of them had
also had a head in the Salon, of which the Figaro had said that it had
"des qualit&eacute;s remarquables." Behind them, the man with the dark
beard and the girl with the delicately-cut face worked at the same
studio; you generally saw them together. The lady sitting alone reading
the Petit Journal was an American. Her line was wood-engraving.</p>

<p>"And does it--does it pay them?" asked Portia, timidly, though she
had hardly uttered the words before she would have liked to retract
them. To look upon art as a means to an end, when it was so evidently,
in Anna's eyes, and in those of all her friends, the be-all and end-all
itself, was, she felt, a sordid and Philistinish point of view. But to
her relief Anna answered her matter-of-fact question in just as
matter-of-fact a way.</p>

<p>"None of them are arriv&eacute; yet, or they wouldn't be here. Some
are well on their way, though; others have about as much as they can do
to scrape along. There are not many among those you see who have made
it pay in the sense of living by their art."</p>

<p>"But you have?" hazarded Portia.</p>

<p>"I have--nearly," said Anna, shortly; "but I've gone in for rather
an expensive atelier. Sixty pounds a year--that's what my rent comes
to. My living costs me from two to two francs fifty a day; then one has
to dress in some kind of way; and colours and studio expenses (I go to
Laurens, too, you know) are pretty heavy. I sold a little 'plein air'
this year, though--an old woman I did on the beach at Etretat--so I'm
in funds just now. But, see, there is Rousky coming."</p>

<p>She half rose from her place, and motioned to Portia to remove her
parasol and gloves from the place opposite to her, towards which the
young man she called Rousky was making his way. As he came closer
Portia could not refrain from casting a look of interested curiosity in
the direction of this friend and oracle of Miss Ross's. Rousky was a
man apparently under thirty years of age, with nothing in his lean
personality and bearded face to distinguish him save a pair of most
remarkable blue eyes, which might almost have been said to kindle, in
the literal sense of the word. They seemed, in contradiction to all
optical laws, to gather their light from within, and made Portia feel
for an instant as though she were in the presence of an illuminate or a
seer. His nostrils were somewhat wide, and his cheeks betrayed the
formation of the Kalmuck's skull. The general coloring was fair. The
head-covering a "beret," which he pulled off before shaking hands with
Anna and seating himself in the place pointed out to him. The
clothes--a much-worn slop-suit, flannel shirt, and carelessly--knotted
black tie.</p>

<p>"This is Ivan Evarchus Rousky," said Anna, at once introducing him
to her companion. "Is that right?" she laughed--"and Miss--?" She
paused, in order to give Portia time to decide by what name she would
choose to be called.</p>

<p>Rousky had turned his eyes like beacon-fires upon her. In obedience
to a curious impulse that she could not account for to herself, and as
though that look, like the very touch of Truth, could penetrate all
disguises, she said simply, "Portia," and went on with her dinner.
Rousky bowed, but paid no further attention to her. Anna drew a book
from her coat pocket, printed in characters which suggested nothing to
Portia's imagination save the "unknown tongues" in type, and opened it
at a passage which she asked him to read aloud for her.</p>

<p>"The Kreuzer Sonata!" he murmured, turning it over; his manner of
pronouncing his "the" had a careful precision that proved his knowledge
of English to be an acquirement of later years. His voice was amazingly
soft. He glanced through the pages before reading the passage Anna had
asked for, absorbing their contents, as it appeared, in a manner
peculiar to himself, for all the time he was softly humming the refrain
of "P&egrave;re la Victoire" through his closed lips. "Why did you
choose that?"</p>

<p>"Because I've read everything else of Tolstoi's. If you don't choose
to read me the passage I showed you, give me back the book."</p>

<p>Her tone was imperious. He raised his head and glanced at her. She
returned his look, and they had a passage at arms, not in words,
but--mutely--with their eyes, exchanging glances that made Portia think
of keen-edged swords, and electric discharges from thunder-clouds.
By-and--by, a certain troubled expression gathered in the black depths
of Anna's eyes. She lowered them gently, and Rousky read aloud, in a
language which, despite the musical cultivation of his voice,
corresponded, to Portia's thinking, with the break-jaw complexity of
the characters, the passage that Anna had pointed out to him.</p>

<p>The reading was followed by a conversation in which our heroine
felt, as she owned to herself, very much "out of it." The names of
Tolstoi, Dolstoievsky, Tourgu&eacute;nief, and many others, about which
they spoke, were all unknown to her. To Anna and her friend they seemed
to furnish a topic for endless discussion. "Tolstoi!" said Rousky once,
with a shrug, "he is only a kind of neonomian!" Whereupon Anna demanded
that the signification of the word "neonomian," and its applicability
to Tolstoi, should be expounded to her. But to do this it was necessary
to refer to the Kreuzer Sonata once more, and to determine just what
Tolstoi had in his mind when he wrote it. When they came to this part
of their subject Rousky relapsed into French, and Anna answered him in
the same language, so that Portia, notwithstanding the fact that she
strained her ears and her brain to the uttermost, only gleaned
fragmentary bits of the conversation. Occasionally, however, she heard
things which inclined her to surmise that perhaps, after all, it was as
well that her powers of comprehending the whole should be so limited.
Her mental pabulum hitherto had been of the milk-for-babes quality, and
the kind she was assimilating now would have been pungent fare even to
seasoned palates. Besides which, though Anna and her friend appeared
very much in earnest in what they were talking about, they did not seem
to affix any standard of right or wrong to the actions of the
characters they discussed. How they would probably have felt themselves
if they had been placed under conditions which induced them to commit a
murder like the hero of a book they were talking about was a notion,
for instance, that they discussed quite calmly. Portia was a little
shocked at this. She heard them characterise conduct as weak or strong,
but never as right or wrong. Nevertheless, she could not help being
interested in watching Rousky's eyes. He did not seem to pay any heed
to his "portion," which Anna had ordered while he was speaking, and
without consulting him (as though she knew what his preference must be
beforehand), but talked on with the curiously illuminated look that had
attracted Portia from the first. Hardly twenty-four hours since she had
left her home, and into what a strange new world she seemed to have
entered already! She could not imagine what part in it she should find
to play. There were moments when a spasm of home-sickness overcame her,
and she felt tempted to run back to England as fast as she had run away
from it. But in England she would not be her own mistress. She had
always understood that there a husband might force his wife to live
with him, and she could not be sure that even Wilmer could protect her
against a husband armed with legal rights. There was something, too, in
the utter freedom of the lives of all these people around her that was
beginning to exercise its fascination upon her. Each one evidently did
as he pleased, went where he pleased, and lived as he pleased. There
could be no Mrs. Grundy where people did not even acknowledge the
existence of that formidable abstraction. After Rousky had finished his
dinner he asked, "You will be in this evening?"</p>

<p>"We shall be in," said Anna pointedly, glancing in Portia's
direction. "You can come up all the same; and you had better bring Mr.
Eames and your Polish friend with you, too."</p>

<h3>Chapter XV</h3>

<p>ONE is inclined to regret sometimes that after Shakespeare had drawn
his inspired picture of the seven ages of man, he did not add thereto a
similar presentment of the seven ages of woman. The first and the last
of these would have been evidently the same for both sexes, but the
intervening period--the one which marks the rise and decline of woman's
influence--the phases during which she is unconscious of her power and
uses, it, or is conscious of it and abuses it, would have been of a
very different kind, and might have marked a history as strange and
eventful as that of any man "who in his time plays many parts."
Maidenhood and wifehood and motherhood might have represented each
their separate act, fraught with at least as great a significance as
the ages of the lover, the soldier, and the justice, and writers in
succeeding ages would have had their choice of seven feminine parts to
which they might have adapted their heroines, as well as of seven
masculine parts for their heroes. In that case Portia might have found
her place in the act which corresponds to the third age in the history
of Shakspeare's man. But the act would have been subdivided, in this
instance, into many separate scenes; and to her own thinking the scene
of her life with Anna upon the quatri&egrave;me of the tall house in
the Rue de Vaugirard would not assuredly have been one of the least
strange.</p>

<p>She had been nearly a week under the shelter of her friend's roof
when we see her sitting alone, with a letter from her husband in her
hand, enclosed under cover of a missive from her faithful Eliza. Anna
had gone to market, bidding her, as she left the room, be ready to
accompany her on her return to the studio of a famous painter, where
Portia was to begin her apprenticeship to the career of a model. The
place was steeped in the calm, warm atmosphere of eight o'clock in the
morning, under an August sky; and the distant noises from outside--the
rumbling of the great omnibuses, the crashing of the carts and
carriages, the strident street-cries--among which the "Marchand
d'ha--bi-i-i-i," with the long-drawn nasal prolonging of the last
syllable, had such a dreary sound--reached her ears through the open
window in a kind of softened cadence. The hour would have been
considered as still very early in the Kensington mansion. Had it not
been looked upon as an astonishing feat on Portia's part to go to the
Academy even later in the day in that far-away time, so near as
regarded the date, so immeasurably far as regarded her own feelings,
when she had met Harry Tolhurst on the steps? Here, on the contrary,
the morning seemed to be well on--for before eight o'clock much had
already been done in Anna's atelier. The room had been done for one
thing. Anna, in morning d&eacute;shabille, with a towel twisted round
her head, had swept the floor, while Portia had dusted and tidied. Then
there had been the door to open five times in succession--twice for the
concierge, who brought the water for the tubs and came up afterwards
with the letters; and then for the baker's woman, with her yard-long
loaves; for the milk-woman, who filled the can hanging to the
door-handle; and for the Auvergnat with the sooty face who brought the
braise. They had breakfasted, besides, upon their usual meal of
caf&eacute; au lait and petits pains, and Portia had washed up and put
by the breakfast things. The week had gone by slowly--not that the time
had hung heavily on her hands, for every hour had been charged with
some new and strange experience, but that it seemed as though untold
ages had elapsed since she had left her home. She had performed the
operation known as shaking into place quickly enough as regarded her
bodily requirements, but the adjusting of her mind to her new
surroundings had not been so easy a task. If she had had a vocation as
Anna had, or passionate convictions like some of her friends, the
untrammelled existence she was free to lead here would have been
everything her heart could have desired. But she was not by any means
sure that she possessed the necessary qualifications for the full and
proper appreciation of such a life. She had been, as Anna had said, a
mere summer insect hitherto; but her wings had been singed, and she had
flown for refuge to a safe hiding--place. Nevertheless, she was still
fluttering in imagination about the scenes she had left. She did not
mean to hide for ever. She was quite willing in the meantime to lead
the life Anna had mapped out for her: to sit and do model for her in
the morning, to take long walks with her in the afternoon, to wander
about the Luxembourg gardens--the quiet end of them--while Anna was at
Laurens, to dine with her at Clootz's, and help her make tea in the
evening for the art-students--men and women who climbed to the
quatri&egrave;me afterwards--to earn her livelihood, and to do her
duty, in short, in that state of life to which Anna would please to
call her; but she could not bring herself to feel a genuine enthusiasm
for such a career. She had the consciousness that she was only resting
on her oars after all, and that by-and-by, she would be steering her
way again through the unknown seas beyond.</p>

<p>Anna had enclosed Portia's letters to Eliza to a London friend, who
in her turn had them dropped into various post offices in and near
London, to which Eliza addressed them in turn. They were subsequently
called for by her friend and despatched to Paris. By this means no clue
to her hiding--place was obtainable, and, before revealing it, Portia
was resolved that John should give her his written promise to help her
to untie the knot she had unwittingly helped him to tie on their
wedding morning. She had not written for the first day, in deference to
Anna's strongly-urged advice on the subject.</p>

<p>"Let them be anxious," she said. "It won't kill them, and they'll be
all the more ready to do what you want. You let them have a notion
where you are, and you'll never bring them to terms." Nevertheless,
Portia's own anxiety would not let her rest, and before she had been
fifty-six hours absent--fifty-six hours that had had the effect of as
many months in their influence upon John's outward appearance--Eliza
had brought her mistress a note containing the words:</p>

<p>"DEAREST EMMA,--I am well and biding my time, leading a very
peaceable existence in my hiding-place, and only anxious about you and
Wilmer. When you both give me your solemn assurance that my marriage
may be undone, or that, at any rate, I may go on living with you as I
did when I was unmarried, and never see John again, I will come back,
but not before. Pray, pray, tell me all about everything, and see that
my birds have their fresh bath every morning."</p>

<p>Portia had received a long letter in reply, wherein Emma had, as she
would have said, "bored" out her heart to her sister-in-law. She had
been inspired to recount the whole scene of the tragic discovery of the
bride's disappearance in redundant German-English--how she herself had
flown to the conservatory (Portia could not help smiling at the
metaphor in connection with the writer's proportions) where the two
gentlemen were smoking: how Wilmer thought she must have put her foot
upon a snake as she had done once in the bedroom at Yarraman, this
being the only occasion besides the actual one upon which she had run
outside with her hair in crimps. Portia smiled once more at the vision
of Emma rushing from her apartment in casual attire with pellets of
hair upon her bare temples--how Wilmer had asked if she was "off her
chump," and she had replied that she was "wholly rational"; and what a
terrible look John had in his eyes when he saw her come in dressed in
that fashion, with the wedding ring and the opal ring in one hand and
the letter for himself in the other.</p>

<p>It did not require Emma's assurance to make Portia believe that John
had looked terrible. Had she not seen that very look in her dreams
night after night since the evening of her flight, when she had dreamed
that he was a raging lion? The letter entered also into as coherent a
description as the writer was able to give of the scene that had ensued
between the baffled bridegroom and the relatives of the bride. Wilmer
and Emma had both upbraided him in turn, and he had sworn that they
were in a plot to rob him of his wife; that they had nothing to do with
his private concerns, and that whoever said he had a wife or a mistress
when he married uttered a lie. "And he did st&uuml;rmen and toben, mein
Gott!" added Emma, with consternation in her handwriting. He had said
he would follow his wife to the end of the world. Portia shuddered as
she read this threat, But subsequent correspondence was of a more
reasoning kind. Wilmer had been very much vexed, his wife wrote, by the
scandal to which Portia's conduct had given rise. Already a paragraph
headed, "Elopement of a Bride on her Wedding Day," had appeared in one
of the papers. He was of opinion that Portia should have put herself
under her brother's protection instead of running away and making
herself a byword. "How could I?" she thought at this point. "John would
have talked him over. I had nothing for it but to go."</p>

<p>Such had been the nature of the correspondence between the runaway
and her home until the sixth morning after her flight, which was marked
by the advent of a letter from John himself.</p>

<p>Portia trembled and turned pale as she received it from the hands of
the concierge. Sitting in the solitude of Anna's quatri&egrave;me, like
Dame Malbrook on her "tour," she opened it with a heart-sinking it was
vain to struggle against. The letter that had been warm under his touch
but yesterday, was here in her hands this morning. How easily he might
have come with his letter if he had only known. Involuntarily she cast
a terrified glance at the door; nobody could enter without the key, and
Anna, who had it in her possession, would be the last to give it up to
Portia's legal lord. Angered against herself, she opened the
envelope--John wrote what is known as a commercial hand--decipherable
even when he had written, as now, under the stress of violent emotion,
and his words were clear to his wife's comprehension at once.</p>

<p>"I could not write before," the letter began. "You have put me into
the state of mind when a man puts a bullet into his head like nothing
at all. Why have you acted so? What satisfaction can it give you to
torture me? If you had told me what was up I could have explained
everything. I have never loved any woman but you, and I never shall, to
my dying day. Men are not like women in those ways. You think I was
fond of that girl who came and parted us just as we'd been made man and
wife! I never cared a straw for her. If you hadn't been twelve thousand
miles away, and if you hadn't sent me one or two letters that seemed to
send a kind of a chill to my heart, it would never have happened. I
wasn't so much to blame in the matter as you might think. You would say
so, too, if you knew a little more about men and the world. But you
were always the veriest sucking-dove in those ways, and that's another
reason why I was so fond of you. I treated the girl as handsomely as I
could. I've been sending her supplies to America--as much as she could
want--ever since she left. It was her own fault if she ran away and let
someone else collar the money. She could have lived where she pleased,
and made a good marriage; and as for the brat, though I'm in no way
bound to believe what she tells me, she would have had no cause to
complain. She only had to speak. What can a man do more? You wouldn't
have had me marry her, would you? There's only one woman in the world,
as you well know, I could ever marry--and I have married her. In the
eyes of God and man she's my wedded wife. Portia! don't break my heart
altogether. If you want to kill me, take a different way of doing it.
While you're hiding away I am eating my heart out about you. You don't
know what it is to feel wild about anyone as I do about you, or you
would have a little pity for me. If you will let us know where you are,
I swear that I will explain everything to your satisfaction. The girl
herself wants you to come back. Emma says you had no money when you ran
away, and she can't for the life of her think of any friends you would
have cared to go to in England. Write, and make your own conditions.
You don't suppose I shall rest night or day till I've found you, so you
had better make your terms while you've got the right end of the stick.
Don't be afraid to trust me because of anything that's happened
lately.</p>

<p>"What I suffered when I found you had run away from me is a lesson
that will about last me for the rest of my days. I ought to have told
you everything, but I was afraid. I thought I'd wait until we were
married and you had got to know me a little better, though it was on
the tip of my tongue to tell you when I put the opal ring--that
confounded ring that's done all the mischief--on your finger. Don't
keep your hiding-place a secret any longer. It's too rough on us all.
Wilmer wants to see us come together again, too. You shall have your
own way in everything. I care for you so much that you will always have
the whip-hand of me. Emma says you've upset all their plans for the
autumn. They can't go away till they know where you are. If you would
come back we could all make a trip together. Perhaps you would prefer
that to our Norway journey that you have knocked on the head. Wherever
you may be when this reaches you, my darling--for you are my darling,
whatever happens, and the thought of you seems to choke me now as I
write--let your heart move you to a little compassion for me. I am so
abjectly miserable without you--I was never a great hand at
letter-writing, but I could fill pages telling you of the different
visions I have had of you lately. When I sit in that greenhouse of
Wilmer's, with my eyes shut, and smell the peppermints and blue-gums, I
declare I can see you just as you were at Yarraman in the old days--a
dear little harum-scarum girl, with your hair flying over your
shoulders, tearing down the paddock with the kangaroo dogs at your
heels. Who would ever have thought you were going to turn into such a
queen of beauty and fashion then! I've been weak and I've been a fool.
I won't deny it; but if you could see into my heart you would believe
me when I say that even when I was most of a fool my heart was fullest
of you--fuller than it could hold. Now, there is God's truth for you,
Portia; and with the prayer that you will think I have been punished
enough, I sign myself your husband, who loves you better than his
life.</p>

<p>"JOHN MORRISSON."</p>

<p>Portia sat with this letter in her hand, gazing abstractedly before
her, until Anna came back, with her basket full and housewifely triumph
in her tones.</p>

<p>"I've been to the r&ocirc;tisserie, and you shall have poulet and
salad for your lunch; what do you think of that? I met Mr. Eames and
the Swedish girl on their way to the atelier. They are raving about the
new model--an Italian girl. By the bye, Portia, what an ideal picture
of Truth one might make of you, with your hair down! A pity you're so
prejudiced still. I must show you Lefebvre's picture at the Luxembourg.
It makes me think of what M&eacute;rim&eacute;e said about artists'
models, and why a femme du monde--a beautiful one--might be treated so
much more satisfactorily. But what is the matter? Have you had bad
news?"</p>

<p>"Bad news? No." It is doubtful whether Portia had heard aught of
Anna's words save the concluding ones. "Only I feel rather as if we
were playing at cross-questions and crooked answers with our
correspondence. I've had a letter from John, and--and he thinks I'm
jealous."</p>

<p>"And you're not?" Anna put this question sharply, with her straight,
black brows drawn together over her snake-like eyes. "Perhaps you
are?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed I'm not," Portia answered slowly. "I've been trying to
analyse my feelings ever since I've been here, and I think it's because
I don't care properly for John that the feeling of jealousy had nothing
to do with my running away. I know pretty well what made me do it. You
see, I only married him because I thought he had a kind of sacred claim
on me. I believed he had been living upon my promise for years past.
When I found that in reality he had been doing nothing of the kind, my
own obligation was gone. Don't you see? There was no longer any
necessity for me to sacrifice myself. Then Mary had prior claims. Hers
were the real ones; mine were only artificial and conventional ones.
But John would have put them first, and at home they would have done
the same; just because we had had the marriage service said over us. I
was afraid of that; I could think of nothing better than to run away;
but now, I suppose, it is nearly time to come to an arrangement of some
kind--to write and say--"</p>

<p>"Not to write and say where you are!" interrupted Anna. "Whatever
you think of doing, don't do that! Let all the pour parlers be carried
on by correspondence. You have everything in your favour as long as
they don't know where to find you. You can dictate your own terms. I
had hoped," she went to the table and began to unpack her basket,
continuing to talk all the time she was placing her purchases upon
plates or in jars--"I had hoped you would find interests here. I know
it is dull work sitting to me in the mornings; but that was only for
practice. If you knew what appreciation you would have, and what money
you might earn! Of course, you could get as much money as you liked if
you went back--I know that. But that is not like earning it yourself;
and would it not be tantamount to selling yourself? After all, I
believe you are hankering after the fleshpots of Egypt, if the truth
were known!"</p>

<p>"What, the home fleshpots! Oh, no!" said Portia, smiling. "But," she
leaned her head upon the window-sill with a gesture of discouragement,
"I feel now as I did when I was living what you called the summer
insect life. What is it to lead to?"</p>

<p>"What does anything lead to?" said Anna, gloomily. "A little less,
or a little more; what does it matter? Who was that Frenchman who said
of the universe that it was the work of the Devil gone mad? If you
reason about things, you may come to that conclusion as well as any
other. What you have to think about is, what each day brings. I believe
your days here would bring you a sense of independence and power you
have never known before--if you will make a little longer trial of
them. You would find a zest in life, when you realised that you could
do exactly as you liked with it, that you have no idea of now. You are
still under the influence of a multitude of conventional ideas and
prejudices. Wait until you have shaken yourself a little more free of
them before you ask what your life here will lead to."</p>

<p>"You have shaken yourself free of them, I suppose, Anna?" The
question seemed to rise unbidden to Portia's lips, "Are you quite
content and happy in your life?"</p>

<p>"Content and happy? Who is? who stops to consider whether he is or
not? 'Oui! de leur sort tous les hommes sont las!' It was Hugo who said
that. But I would as soon go to prison as go back to my old
life--rather, in fact, for there would be less pretence about it.
However, try and hold out a little longer. We're to see about your pose
this afternoon, and we can go to the Luxembourg afterwards; then
Clootz's; and we'll wind up with the Gaiet&eacute; Montparnasse, if
it's a cool evening."</p>

<h3>Chapter XVI</h3>

<p>IF Portia had been told to mount her horse anywhere in the wilds of
Australia, and to ride in a beeline from one given point to another,
with nothing but her own bird-like instinct of locality to guide her,
she would have obeyed without the smallest hesitation. But when Anna
desired her to explore unaided the old and new streets of the Quartier
Latin, she avowed that she was afraid of the undertaking. The dangers
that might befal her in the Bush, where to lose her way, to be thrown
from her horse, or, worst of all, to be "stuck up" by a "sun-downer,"
were contingencies that pointed to the most tragic endings, seemed as
nothing compared with the formidableness of finding herself in such
unknown labyrinths as the precincts of the Sorbonne or the
Od&eacute;on, with the consciousness that she was being observed and
tracked by some casual admirer. Upon the first occasion that she had
become aware that she was followed she had never doubted that the
person so following her was a private French detective in John's
employ; and when she heard the formula, "Permettez-vous que je vous
accompagne, made-moiselle?" she had hurried on with an expression of
such genuine terror in her face that her chance adorer had been
discouraged, and had fallen behind. "That's only their way of showing
their appreciation; you needn't take any notice of it," Anna had said,
laughing, when Portia tremulously recounted her adventure. But the
sense of being noticed and pursued in any fashion, under present
circumstances, was such a terrifying one that she preferred to sit and
think, or to sit and brood, as Anna called it, alone, when the latter
was away, to venturing out by herself. Nothing could have marked more
plainly the difference between the Portia of a few weeks back and the
Portia of to-day--the Portia who had set out so gaily in the
ruddily-gathering fog by herself to visit the Academy, and the Portia
who shrank now from going unaccompanied round the corner.</p>

<p>"It's to do the Lorelei you'll be wanted," Anna explained to her the
same afternoon as they were walking together along the unfrequented end
of the Rue d'Assas, bordering the Luxembourg Gardens--"'and she combed
her golden hair,' you remember, don't you? Delstanche" (she named a
painter since celebrated) "thinks you must have come into the world for
the express purpose."</p>

<p>"I wonder why you care so much to have me pose," observed Portia,
reflectively; "you make such a point of it, Anna! And it never seems to
me that it is really earning money to make it in that way. I might be
an idiot--I should earn it all the same. It is not as though I had to
work for what I get, or as though it cost me any trouble. I feel
ashamed to be paid for just sitting still. There is nothing to do. I
only have to be--"</p>

<p>"You little goose!"--Anna's tones were incisive and
disdainful--"that is just the glory of it. It is not for anything
grafted on to you; it is for being you yourself that you are paid. Did
you never read what Renan says about a beautiful woman being the
highest expression of the Creator's power? That is the way you should
look at it. As for not earning what you get like any one else, that is
all nonsense. One person has a fine voice, and makes money by it.
Another has brains, and he makes money by them. You have what is better
than either."</p>

<p>"I can't think that," said Portia, sceptically; "that is only your
way of looking at it, Anna. Besides, one has to work hard to cultivate
a voice and brains; but to pose, one has nothing to cultivate--that is
just what I complain of."</p>

<p>"One has to cultivate the art of keeping still--which you have not
quite acquired yet, my dear, let me tell you. I can see you are
dead-beat sometimes...But you want to know why I make such a point of
having you pose. I'm afraid it's just for the gratification of
producing you. A model like you is as rare in her way as a Patti or a
Sarah Bernhardt in hers. Then you happen to be going through an
experience that intensifies all your natural advantages. You needn't
laugh; what I am telling you is perfectly true. Any one can see you are
not thinking of yourself when you pose. I don't know what you are
thinking of, but you have a kind of abstracted look in your eyes, and
that coupled with their curious colour, makes them just like an
Undine's or a Lorelei's. And then your wonderful hair! Your hair and
your skin are exactly the kind that artists rave about, and so seldom
find."</p>

<p>Portia made no reply to this tirade. Perhaps her thoughts had
already been wandering in other directions. She had not forgotten to
deliver Anna the message her gentleman-help had confided to her the day
of her arrival, and there had been hardly an evening since upon which
Mr. Eames, as he was called, had not knocked at their door upon their
return from Clootz's. Sometimes he stayed an hour, sometimes longer. He
would begin the conversation by talking artistic "shop" to Anna, and
Portia would marvel at the animation they showed in discussing "plein
air" and "impressionist toiles." But after a while Rousky and his
Polish friend, or some newer interest of Anna's, would monopolise her
attention. She and her fellow--smokers would form a little group apart,
and Portia would be left to talk to Mr. Eames alone. She could not help
feeling that he was interested in her, and that he showed his interest
by trying, not obtrusively, but naively, to find out who and what she
was. She had decided with Anna that she should be called by her
mother's name of Drew, and no one among her new entourage suspected
that she was other than Miss Drew, or that she had been at any time of
her life though the marriage ceremony. She could not talk about
pictures to Mr. Eames; but they had other points in common. He was fond
of music and played with expression, though with little science or
execution. Portia also loved music, and allowed herself to be persuaded
to sing her simple ballads of "Ben Bolt" and "Robin Adair" to please
him. He seemed to take it for granted that she knew infinitely more
than was the case, and often when he was speaking to her she was
obliged to interrupt him by asking for information upon some point that
was evidently only the A B C of his theme. But she had explained to him
that she came from Australia, and, far from making her feel "small,"
when she confessed her ignorance he appeared to take a delight in
placing her on the same level as himself, and implying that she could
teach him perhaps even more than he could teach her. Her gentleman-help
was the only artist, excepting Harry Tolhurst, whom Portia had met, and
she was willing now to like the whole tribe.</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Eames paint good pictures?" she asked of Anna, after a
long pause, with apparent inconsequence in the question, though in
reality it was the result of a long train of thought.</p>

<p>Anna replied with a shrug; the gesture was so natural and
appropriate that one would never have supposed that she was not to the
manner born. "He makes wonderful beginnings," she said; "perhaps he
will make good ends, too, some days. But here we are at Delstanche's.
Mind, now, you pull out that silver arrow from your hair when I tell
you."</p>

<p>While Portia Morrisson, alias James, alias Drew, is engaged in
putting on the attributes of the soul-and-body-alluring Lorelei, her
friend Mr. Eames has been busily engaged in making a sketch from memory
of her in his studio. He is so much engrossed in it, and there is such
a fascination in evoking the image of her charming figure standing near
the piano, that it is only when a man's step mounting the staircase
stops before his door, and a voice he recognises calls from the landing
outside, "Let me in, old fellow," that he desists from his work. But
before going to the door he has thrust his sketch, with a heap of
others, into a portfolio. Miss Drew's image on paper must not be
revealed to indifferent eyes, any more than the image of her he is
beginning to carry about in his mind. "Heart" would be, perhaps, the
more fitting word to use in this connection, though Mr. Eames, perhaps,
was not aware of it himself in his present phase.</p>

<p>"And you never sent me word you were coming," he said reproachfully,
a moment later, and after a grip of the hands had been exchanged
between himself and the new-comer.</p>

<p>"I didn't know it myself till last night, to tell the truth,"
replied Harry Tolhurst--for the young man in the ulster, with the
canvas-covered paint--box in his hand, to whom Mr. Eames had just
opened the door, was none other than Harry. "I knew I should find you
in the old place. And how are you getting on, old fellow? You got your
'Saint Bavon' into the Salon all right?"</p>

<p>"N--no, I didn't;" the admission was made reluctantly. "I wasn't
satisfied with it in the end."</p>

<p>"And you made such a splendid &eacute;bauche. You want someone to
wrench your work away from you when you've brought it up to a certain
point, I fancy. What are you at work on now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've half a dozen things in hand. I'll show them to you
by-and-by. Tell me first though--I'm awfully glad to see you--but why
didn't you give me warning? You're not looking up to the mark, by any
means. You haven't had the influenza--"</p>

<p>"Influenza? No. I've been rather knocked out of time by a trouble
I've been mixed up with lately, that's all. I thought I'd propose a
walking tour in Brittany, if you haven't made any plans of your
own."</p>

<p>"Brittany be bothered! I haven't any money. Let's go to
Barbizon."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't be any cheaper. Besides, it's no use to potter about
the forest. I want to go in for active exercise of some kind. I think I
need it."</p>

<p>"You look as though you did, old man! 'Pon my word, I believe you
must have had the influenza, after all--or you've been overdoing it
somehow."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have been working too hard," admitted Harry; but the
admission was obviously made for the purpose of putting an end to the
cross-examination to which his friend seemed inclined to subject him.
"And how are all the Paris lot? Is Miss Ross always to the fore?"</p>

<p>"Rousky's to the fore," responded Mr. Eames, shortly. He paused a
moment, and continued: "There's a girl, a young lady, staying with Anna
Ross just now."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Harry, indifferently.</p>

<p>"Yes. You'll see her to-night, I expect, at Clootz's. I should like
to know what you think of her."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Harry again. "Pour cause?"</p>

<p>"Pour cause--if her presence accounts for the fact that I am
irresistibly drawn to Anna's studio every evening. But I'm afraid she's
not a permanent; she's only some beautiful bird of passage. With us,
and not of us."</p>

<p>"It's as serious as that!" said his friend smiling. Harry's smiles
were, as we have seen, extremely rare; and it would seem that they had
become more fleeting as well, for his face relapsed almost immediately
into its accustomed morne expression.</p>

<p>His companion, meanwhile, was already half regretting the
confidences he had made. To tell the truth, it was only the longing to
find a pretext for speaking about Portia that had prompted him to make
them at all, though perhaps he was not loth to let his friend know at
the same time that the priority of right of paying particular court to
the charming bird of passage overhead was, in a measure, bespoken. A
growing interest of a tender description will manifest itself sometimes
in an irresistible desire to speak of the adored object in season and
out of season; and until Harry appeared upon the scene, there was no
one to whom Portia's gentleman-help could unburden himself in any
degree respecting the nature of the sentiment she had awakened in him.
He did not go so far, however, as to display his memory-sketch of her
to Harry. There were a hundred congenial topics for the newly-restored
friends to talk about without entering into their affaires de coeur, as
women would have done in their place--their own works and that of their
fellow-artists being naturally the most congenial topic of all. Harry
had to be posted up in all the latest gossip of the atelier, to be
informed as to which of the band was arriv&eacute;, who among them had
"exposed" at the Salon, who had been lucky enough to have his toile
purchased by the French Government, and a great deal more to the same
effect. Occasionally, however, he would relapse into the kind of
reverie known as a "brown study" (though why a study should be brown,
while the devils of despondency are blue, is a fact that no one has
ever satisfactorily explained), and would apparently gaze right through
the "St. Bavon" that he had been criticising in his friend's behoof, or
beyond it, to some intangible picture of his own evoking. At these
moments a puzzled look would flit across Mr. Eames's pleasant blue
eyes, and turning around to place his picture against the wall, he
would hum softly--</p>

<pre>
  "Elle avait des mani&egrave;res tr&egrave;s bien.
  "Elle &eacute;tait coiff&eacute;e &agrave; la chien.
  "Elle chantait comme une petite folle.
  A Batignolles." 
</pre>

<p>"Let's take a turn in the Luxembourg before dinner," he said at
last. "It seems to me you want rousing up, old man!"</p>

<p>"All right," assented Harry coming back to himself with an effort
from the visionary regions he had been wandering in. "But haven't you
to get ready first?"</p>

<p>"Ready! That won't take me long. I'm ready now."</p>

<p>He had been, in point of fact, peeling off his plum-coloured jersey
and dragging it over his head as he spoke, and now substituted in its
place a morning coat and artistically-knotted Lavalli&egrave;re
tie.</p>

<p>A Tam-o'-Shanter completed his costume; and thus attired, with his
pipe and tobacco-pouch thrust into his pocket, he followed his friend
out of the studio.</p>

<p>It was an afternoon upon which the band of the Garde
R&eacute;publicaine had been announced to play in the Luxembourg
Gardens, and, though the performance was drawing to a close, the crowd
was still great. In the close neighbourhood of the music all the chairs
were taken, but a throng of promenaders was circling round them, amid
which the grisettes of the Quartier Latin mustered in full force. Harry
paused a moment before joining in the round to take in the details of
the scene. It had been familiar enough to him during his last long
residence in Paris, but it came upon him now with an air of novelty.
Looked at from a surface point of view, it was a gay and enlivening
spectacle enough. What prettier setting for holiday--makers assembled
in the open air would it be possible to find than this exquisite
commingling of nature and art--this glorious profusion of trees and
lawns, and terraces and parterres, and fountains and statues, blended
into a stately and harmonious mise en sc&egrave;ne? There, as he
remembered it, was the grotto of the monster Polyphemus, with the water
still musically coursing over the white body of the beautiful nymph
Galatea. Away in front of him were the rigid statues of the Queens of
France, ranged in stony propriety against their background of leafy
green. To his right, the descending steps of the terrace leading to a
vast parterre of flowers, worthy of framing the "stately pleasure dome"
of Kubla Khan, in the midst of which a mighty jet of water rose and
fell, lazily and without effort, as though it were dancing up and down
for its own pleasure alone. Among the crowds of listeners the streaming
ribands of the nourrices and their gold--pinned capes made a pretty
variety, while around the feet of the fat French mamans and bonnes the
little ch&eacute;ris and bibiches in limited number (for olive-branches
in France are a luxury not to be too recklessly indulged in) turned up
the dusty soil with their miniature wooden spades.</p>

<p>The band was playing the Marche Indienne as Harry and his companion
drew near, and the wild joyousness of the strain seemed to harmonise
well with the scene around them. Harry centred his attention upon the
students and the grisettes, as being the newest element that the show
could furnish him after his long severance from Quartier Latin ways. He
saw that the students walked by themselves, and the grisettes by
themselves, either in arm-in-arm couples or in affectionate clusters of
threes and fours, and whenever one group or couple passed or met
another group, a word, or a nod, or a passing "H&eacute;, mon petit!"
or "Tiens, ma belle!" testified to the friendly relations existing
between them. Some of the grisettes--modistes, perhaps, in their own
right--wore wildflower-wreathed hats that recalled a vision of Portia
on the Academy morning to Harry's mind. Others, apparently of the
blanchisseuse order, who possessed nothing, in all probability, but
their bodies in their own right, wore no hats at all. These, however,
were always daintily coiff&eacute;, and all bore alike a certain air of
trim neatness and artistic nattiness. Few possessed pretty faces, and
among those who had lost their first freshness more than one had hard
eyes and an animal mouth. It was in vain that Harry sought to discover
a Mimi Pinson among them. He turned away from the spectacle with a
grave face, while his friend laughed, and observed:</p>

<p>"A page out of the Vie de Boh&egrave;me. You should go to the Bal
Bullier to see the suite."</p>

<p>"I don't care to see it," he said, with a sigh, "when I think it's
been going on since Murger's time--and how long before?--and that it
will be going on when all these people are dead and gone. I feel like
that Duke--I forget his name--I should like to build myself a place
underground, and never come out of my hole again."</p>

<p>The bitterness with which Harry said these words struck painfully
upon his friend's ear. "There's something more than influenza in this,"
he said to himself sagely. "Whatever the trouble that he's been mixed
up with may be, it's evident he's been pretty hard hit; it's gone
deep."</p>

<p>"Come on, old fellow!" he added aloud. "Don't do the King Solomon
business over again. It's very pleasant while it lasts, and where's the
use of looking 'before and after'? I wish you would tell me your yarn.
I'm as open with you myself as a child. Come on to the bench over
there, and let's have a smoke."</p>

<p>Now, as Fate or Chance would have it--for Fate and Chance mean much
the same thing--at the very moment when the two young men were about to
take their seats upon the empty bench on the other side of the broad
avenue, beneath one of the properest of the stone queens arrayed in her
chiselled vertugadin, Portia was crossing the same spot from the
opposite end of the garden. Her visit to the painter, Delstanche, had
not been altogether as satisfactory to herself as to Anna. She had been
made to take her hair down, and to show her neck and arms in all their
summer whiteness; and though she had done as much times out of mind
during the past week while she had been posing for Anna, to do so on
the present occasion had seemed a formidable ordeal. Anna had upbraided
her for her self-consciousness, and had declared that she had no true
feeling for art, otherwise she would have been glad to consecrate her
beautiful person to the cause; and had left her, after thus scolding
her, to go to Colla Rossi's studio, but not until she had shown her
friend how she might return through the Luxembourg Gardens alone.
Portia had sat for a long time in a secluded corner of these, out of
the way of the crowd and the band, thinking drearily of what she should
do, and only solacing herself by glancing from time to time at the
evening sky, made up of a mass of dark grey clouds, through which the
declining sun seemed to burn redly in patches and scratches of flame.
After a time she noticed that the bench she was sitting on had another
occupant. A Frenchman of the m&eacute;ridional type (though, to our
heroine, he was neither more nor less than a Frenchman), with swarthy
skin and piercing black eyes, was eyeing her with undisguised
admiration. She looked away in the vain effort to appear unconscious of
his glance, but the tell-tale colour mantling over cheek and neck
betrayed her. He moved a little nearer, and said abruptly:</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu! mademoiselle, ne vous effrayez pas. Mais vous &ecirc;tes
tellement jolie--on aurait de la peine &agrave; ne pas vous regarder,
et--"</p>

<p>Portia did not give him time, however, to finish all his sentence.
At the first words she had jumped from her seat with the rapid movement
of a frightened bird, and was walking away, straight in front of her,
with no definite idea but to escape. She heard quick footsteps behind
her, and the same voice that had already addressed her repeated
reproachfully, "O, la cruelle!"</p>

<p>Notwithstanding her real alarm the solemn absurdity of this
denunciation was almost too much for Portia's gravity. But she felt
that to lose her dignity at this juncture would be fatal. She walked
on, therefore, looking neither to the right nor the left, with her head
erect; quite unmindful of the fact that two young men, new-comers
these, were about to cross her path diagonally.</p>

<p>"There's an illustration of the hawk and the pigeon game," Mr. Eames
said. He had taken in the situation at a glance. "It wouldn't be a bad
idea for a tableau de genre. Why"--his voice changed suddenly, and its
tones become strangely eager, "if I don't believe--no, surely--it can't
be--yes, it is--it is--it's she--it's Miss Drew!"</p>

<p>"That Miss Drew!" echoed Harry. It was all that in the profound
astonishment of the discovery he could find voice to say, for at this
moment Portia looked round, and a shock of mutual recognition ensued
between them.</p>

<p>The quality that renders a man of the world so valuable in an
emergency is, above all, his presence of mind. Having reached the point
at which nothing can any longer take him by surprise, he never commits
the blunder of losing his head, but keeps his mind clear for action
under the most startling and unforeseen circumstances. Harry Tolhurst
was not perhaps, strictly speaking, a man of the world in this sense.
The surprise of suddenly beholding the woman who had become such a
living memory to him; the woman whom he believed to be lost to him for
ever--to be married indeed, and wandering over Europe with her husband
(for Mary had disappeared since the morning when she had rushed with
her child, like one demented, from his studio, and there had been no
one to inform him of the sequel to Portia's wedding); the astonishment
of encountering her here in Paris under a new name, a name that
belonged to her neither as maid nor as wife; of finding her transformed
into a denizen of the Quartier Latin, and a guest of the emancipated
Anna; roving about the Luxembourg by herself, and fleeing before
unwelcome attentions--the shock of it was so great that he was unable
at first to command his countenance. Portia had "gone white," as the
common people say, on beholding him, and to a casual observer it might
have seemed that these two young people, meeting by accident upon a
lovely summer's evening in the brightest place in creation, must have
taken each other for ghosts, so unduly startled did they appear. To
anyone who had witnessed the exquisite rendering of Romeo and Juliet at
the Lyceum there would have been a something, however, underlying the
terror in Portia's eyes that might have dimly recalled the expression
in Juliet's face when she beheld Romeo for the first time. Though not a
man of the world, Harry was able to divine that there was more than one
cause for the emotion his presence had aroused. That Portia wished him
to appear as though he did not recognise her was evident to him from
the half--imploring glance that followed her first uncontrollable start
of surprise. It was well for both, perhaps, that the gentleman-help was
so wholly engrossed in his own share of interest in the meeting, and
that three subjects filled his mind at this moment to the exclusion of
all others: the first being disappointment that he could not gratify
his impulse to pommel the m&eacute;ridional on the spot; the second,
the desire to know whether Miss Drew's sudden pallor was to be entirely
ascribed to the emotion consequent upon having been accosted, or
whether his own appearance as a rescuer could have had any share in it;
and the third the regret that he had come out in his Tam-o'-Shanter,
and was obliged to feel himself so altogether unfit an object to
accompany the perfectly dressed lady of his allegiance.</p>

<p>By the time he had made up his mind that none of these subjects
could be satisfactorily disposed of at the present moment, Portia had
been enabled to recover a certain degree of sang-froid, and Harry had
mastered himself sufficiently to become a party to the farce of being
formally presented to her by his friend. Under ordinary circumstances
there would have been nothing to justify Mr. Eames in doing more than
raising his hat and passing on--but Fate seemed to have willed that he
and Miss Drew should never meet save under extraordinary circumstances.
Had not they broken the ice once and for all when he had done
"porte-faix" and "water-carrier," to say nothing of all-round
gentleman-help, for her upon the first occasion of his meeting her as
she sat helpless upon the stairs outside his room? And was he going to
abandon her now, when he encountered her speeding like a fluttered bird
before the unwelcome advances of an insolent foreigner! There was every
warrant, he told himself, for stopping to speak to her--he did not add
that even had there been none at all he would probably have done the
same. But he addressed her in the soft, half-caressing,
half--protecting voice that came to him instinctively when he spoke to
a pretty woman. He asked permission to see her safe through the Gardens
("safe" seemed an allowable adjective in the face of what he had just
witnessed), and he excused himself for being in such ragamuffin trim;
and finally he bethought himself of his friend, in whose direction Miss
Drew had studiously refrained from looking, and begged to be allowed to
introduce Mr. Harry Tolhurst, a distinguished painter and Academician
"en herbe" to her notice.</p>

<p>Portia bowed assent, and for one brief instant Harry's eyes
encountered her in full. Well may the eyes be called the windows of the
soul when so much can stand revealed through them in the mearest flash
of time. That Portia understood and appreciated his reticence, that she
was grateful to him beyond words for having exercised it and that she
trusted--yes, that she trusted him entirely--all this Harry could read
in that one transient glance. The knowledge that he shared a secret
with her, unknown to anybody else in the world (bewildering as the
existence of a secret of any kind undoubtedly was, and terrifying as
the revelation of a mystery of any kind in connection with her pure
young life must necessarily appear), was the greatest possible solace
to him. Just as he had parted from her in Piccadilly, after that
red-letter, radiant white-stone morning he had spent with her at the
Academy, so she appeared to him now? The very dress that clung in its
tailor-made folds round her supple, beautiful form--the very
rose-splattered hat, under whose broad rim he had last looked into her
eyes, were the same. The intensity of his recollection of her was made
clear to him as he measured the resemblance between it and the living,
breathing woman in front of him. It must have been a prophetic
intuition surely that had made him attribute the "seediness" that his
friend had detected in him to a "trouble he had been mixed up with;"
for the trouble had been none other than Portia herself, and though the
"mixing up" had not as yet occurred, it seemed likely to take place
now. But how far would she trust him?--how far would her spoken
confidences ratify the assurance of her belief in him that he could
read in her eyes? It could be nothing but a providential interposition
surely that had sent him to the very place to which she had fled for
refuge, in order that he might be at hand to help and perhaps to save
her. Anna Ross's quatri&egrave;me was not perhaps the precise ark of
refuge in which he would have cared to see a sister of his own take
shelter; but Portia, in her transparent innocence, was no doubt like
Charity--fearing nothing, believing all things, and hoping all
things.</p>

<p>To think, however, that his friend Eames's babble concerning the
stranger overhead--the beautiful bird of passage, as he had called
her--should have had none other than Portia James for its object! How
different from the unconcerned "Ah!" with which he had greeted the
communication, would have been his manner of receiving it, if he could
have had the least idea to whom it referred. The thought that Portia
might still be free; that her marriage announcement which he had read
in the papers (would he ever forget the chill it had sent through all
his being?) was the result of some ghastly blunder, made his heart beat
high with hope. He watched with jealous eyes for the manifestation of
some particular sympathy existing between his friend and the supposed
Miss Drew; but Portia's manner reassured him. Not so his friend's! That
the gentleman-help had been, in vulgar parlance, "bowled over" would
have been clear to less jealous eyes than his. Portia was the same, and
yet not the same. She had lost the enjouement that he remembered, which
had been a great charm. But she had gained something in its place that
seemed to rivet him to her more closely still. When he had thought of
her hitherto, it had been as of Undine before she had awakened to the
possession of a soul, or as of the little mermaid before she had
acquired a pair of white human feet and immortality by walking over
knives. He could have fancied that Portia was walking over the knives
now, and that the dawn of the newly-awakened soul was reflected in her
eyes. If he had been walking by her side in the Palace of Truth he
would have spoken out his thoughts concerning her; but as he was
walking under the eyes of a third person, and as she had chosen to
appear in the character of the young lady to whom he had been only just
introduced, he maintained a discreet silence. To feign indifference was
his only refuge. Under the actual circumstances he felt that he could
not trust himself to speak.</p>

<p>Mr. Eames, for his own part, thought it wiser to abstain from making
any reference to the hawk-and-pigeon episode he had witnessed, but he
promised himself that he would be at hand upon the very next occasion
that it should befall Miss Drew to sit in the Luxembourg Gardens
alone.</p>

<p>"Miss Ross is not with you?" he said inquiringly; his tone seemed to
imply that she ought to have been. "I thought I saw you go out
together."</p>

<p>"She had to go to Colla Rossi's," replied Portia. "She told me to
meet her at Clootz's at six; and there is a book I promised to call for
at the atelier first on the way."</p>

<p>"May I get it for you?" he asked; "or may we wait for you until you
are ready, as we are going to Clootz's too?"</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Portia, hesitatingly; "but, indeed, I know my way so
well from the atelier now."</p>

<p>Though her words conveyed no absolute refusal of the offer, Harry
gathered from them that she did not wish to afficher herself in
public--the public at Clootz's--with Mr. Eames, and he rejoiced thereat
in his heart. The latter, however, did not allow himself to be
discouraged.</p>

<p>"I hope you will keep places for us at your table, then," he said,
"Or, if we are there first, shall we keep yours at ours? Tolhurst and
Miss Ross are old friends."</p>

<p>"Oh, are they?" said Portia, raising her eyes shyly towards Harry's
face as she spoke. "I must prepare Anna for the meeting. I am sure she
will be very pleased."</p>

<p>It was the first time she had looked in his direction, though she
was walking between the two young men as they made their way along the
gravelled terrace fronting the ancient palace, bordered by the trim row
of orange trees in green tubs. The pleasant feeling of complete ease
which she had known when she had last encountered Harry was gone. She
had herself willed that he should pass for a stranger in her eyes: yet
how could she bring herself to address him as a stranger when he was in
reality so closely bound up with all the associations that she clung to
most in her past life? She had not said to him in so many words, like
the conspirators in a burlesque, "Let us dissemble." But her eyes had
said it for her, and he had dissembled accordingly. What could he have
thought of the obligation she had thus laid upon him? There was yet
another curious sensation respecting him in her mind. Though the
feeling of being at ease in his society had disappeared, the knowledge
of the tacit understanding existing between herself and him, the sense
of the secret they were sharing together unknown to all (for even Anna
need not be told that Harry was a former acquaintance), seemed to have
brought her into closer communion with him than ever. She remembered
how she had felt in her childish days when a household birthday was in
store and a surprise was to be operated upon Emma or Wilmer--how the
person with whom she shared the secret involved in the preparation of
the surprise had assumed quite a new importance in her life; how the
interchange of a look had become an action fraught with a mysterious
significance of its own; how the idea of "we know something" seemed to
be expressed in every gesture of the person who was in partnership in
her secret, and what good friends it had made them as long as the
secret lasted. Were these the terms upon which she would find herself
placed henceforth with Harry, or was he condemning her in his mind for
having a secret at all? He had answered her look of inquiry when Anna's
name was mentioned, but his voice had sounded formal and distant.</p>

<p>"I had the pleasure of meeting Miss Ross at Julian's some three
years ago," he said. "Does she go there still?"</p>

<p>"No; she is at Laurens' now, and she works out of doors a good deal
besides."</p>

<p>"Yes, she is a tremendous worker," put in Mr. Eames. "She is
serieuse, as they say at the atelier. That reminds me, Tolhurst, you
must see her old woman on the beach at Etretat. As a 'plein air' it is
capital, full of air and light. By the bye, what has become of your
Madonna? A lot of fellows here have told me about it. They say you
could never have painted such a picture if you hadn't done your time in
Paris. Where is she now?"</p>

<p>"Well, the picture is hanging in my studio," said Harry. "The
dealers would have none of it although the critics waged a fierce war
over it. As for my model, she left me en plan. That is one of the
reasons why I came over. I was at work upon a fresh subject with the
same model, and about a week ago she disappeared, and I have not been
able to find a trace of her so far."</p>

<p>"Fancy that!" said Mr. Eames, with mock solemnity, and he softly
chanted:</p>

<pre>
  "'Je l' ai aimee autant que j' ai, pu
    Mais j' ai pas pu lorsque j' ai su
    Qu'elle me trompait avec Anatole
       A Batignolles.'" 
</pre>

<p>"Did you inquire at the place she lived at?" asked Portia, in a
strained and eager voice. "Could they tell you nothing of her
there?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever!" The interest manifested by Miss Drew in his
friend's model surprised Mr. Eames not a little. "But she was not a
professional model. I rather think she was a deserted wife. Her husband
had sent her over from America with the promise that he would follow
her, but after she reached London she heard nothing more of him; she
was glad to earn a little money by posing, and I think she used to
ruminate over her wrongs while she was sitting for me. I have seen her
eyes flash and her lips move more than once."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the husband came back," said Portia, in a low voice, with
her eyes fixed upon the ground.</p>

<p>"I hope he did, for her sake, though not for mine. It will be a long
time before I find such a model again. I believe that must have been
the explanation of the mystery though, for they told me at the place
she lived at that a broad, red-bearded man--a swell (they were careful
to mention that he was a swell)--had been to see her the day she ran
away from the studio--the husband, without any doubt; and there had
been a scene between the newly-united couple, as it appeared. The next
morning Mrs. Morris disappeared with her baby, bag and baggage, and
left no address, but behaved ' 'and-some'--as her landlady told
me--from which I concluded that the husband is rich, and that I may
look for my model again in vain."</p>

<p>"What a curious story!" said Portia. She paused, and a deep roselike
flush mounted in her cheeks before she spoke again. "Do you know--did
they say--could you tell me, perhaps" (she seemed to find a difficulty
in framing her question). "whether the husband was finally reconciled
to his--wife?--whether they stayed together, I mean?"</p>

<p>"I don't know the sequel," said Harry. The interest Miss James took
in his unknown model, which he had attributed in the first instance to
her sole recollection of his picture (how well he remembered her
telling him of her weird impression in connection with it the first
time she had seen it standing by his side!), was beginning to puzzle
him almost as much as Mr. Eames. "I daresay I could find out, though,
if you want to be satisfied upon the point of whether they lived
happily 'ever after.' But I'm afraid they didn't, and that they never
will. She evidently had no confidence in him, and he seems to have left
her after making the scene I was told about. Whether she intended to
run after him when she left in such a hurry the next morning, or
whether she was running away from him in her turn, I have no means of
knowing. Sometimes I think she will turn up again, for, to say the
least of it, she ought to have written me a line if she had no
intention of coming back at all. "</p>

<p>"It would interest me to know, if you do hear," persisted Portia, "I
have seen the picture Mr. Eames was talking about in the Academy; I
remember it very well. The child was fair and blue-eyed, and the
Madonna had strange dark eyes, with a wistful look, that seemed to see
some far-away vision of the cross. They were eyes that would haunt one
afterwards. Mary's dress was a sort of striped blue and white drapery,
was it not? And through an open space in the background you could see a
glimpse of an Eastern landscape in a kind of blinding sunlight."</p>

<p>"Well, if your picture impressed itself upon the memory of everyone
who saw it as thoroughly as upon Miss Drew, you have no cause to
complain, old man," said Mr. Eames; "you must have struck oil this
time, and no mistake! And this is the person who will never say a word
about pictures to me--who can't draw, she says!"</p>

<p>Harry turned towards her, with a gratified smile--one of his rare
smiles--lighting up his sombre eyes.</p>

<p>"You must have been a good many times to the Academy, I should
think."</p>

<p>"Only once," responded Portia, with an answering smile of quiet
triumph in her glance. An unreasoning pleasure was coursing through her
veins as she exchanged this look of secret understanding with him.
Those two little words implied so much more than any but he and she
could wot of.</p>

<p>"Only once!" echoed Mr. Eames, while Harry was hugging himself with
the idea that her avowal might be construed as he would fain have
construed it in his heart. "Then you have a phenomenal memory for
pictures, that is all I can say; and upon the ex pede Herculem basis
you should make a capital art critic. By the bye, Miss Ross said she
was going to initiate you into the mysteries of the Gaiet&eacute;
Montparnasse to-night. It's a great institution. Those cafes chantants
on the other side of the river are the abomination of desolation in my
eyes, but the Gaiet&eacute; is almost worthy of its name. You remember
it, Harry?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I can boast of any acquaintance with it," replied
Harry, drily, "if it is a thing to boast of at all. Miss Ross's ways
are peculiar, and tastes differ; but if the Gaiet&eacute; Montparnasse
is what I imagine it to be, I don't think Miss James--Miss Drew, I
mean--will be particularly edified or amused by a visit there--a kind
of sixth-rate Paulus-and-Th&eacute;r&egrave;se entertainment, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it! It has a line of its own," laughed Mr. Eames. And
once more he hummed:</p>

<pre>
  "'La morale de c'tte oraison l&agrave;
   C'est qu' les p'tites fill's qu'a pas d' papa
   Doiv'nt jamais aller &agrave; l'&eacute;cole
      A Batignolles.'" 
</pre>

<p>The closing "Batignolles" had each time a long-drawn sonorous sound
that fell tunefully upon the ear.</p>

<p>"Do tell me all the song, please," said Portia.</p>

<p>"I will concoct an expurgated rendering of it, if you will allow
me," he said; "but you mustn't let yourself be prejudiced by
anticipation against the Gaiet&eacute;. It has its vile side, of
course, if you look for it; but you won't look for it--and there is
some awfully pretty singing. It's a great place, too, for seeing the
populace. If Miss Ross really means to go, my friend and I" (he looked
at Harry for assent) "will ask leave to accompany you. It's not a place
where a lady ought to go by herself."</p>

<p>"If Miss Ross is as I remember her, she does not admit that such
places exist," said Harry.</p>

<p>"Well, then, we'll help her to take care of Miss Drew, who does
admit it," said Mr. Eames, and, the limit of the gardens being reached
by this time, the two separated by the large iron gates that guard the
entrance to the Luxembourg Gardens on the Rue de Vaugirard side. Portia
went on her way alone. The expression that Harry read in her eyes as
she wished him "Au revoir" expressed the word Remember as plainly as
ever the voice of the murdered Charles sounding through the ages could
have uttered it. Before separating, it was arranged that the party
should meet again at Clootz's half an hour later.</p>

<p>"Has Miss Drew been here long?" was Harry's first question as he
turned away with his friend; there was no loop-hole of a pretext for
running after Portia, as he was longing to do; and the burden upon his
mind was only in part alleviated by finding her again under
circumstances so unexpected and mysterious.</p>

<p>"Six days and six nights," answered Mr. Eames sententiously; he had
lit his pipe immediately the feminine element was removed from his
path, and he was puffing it into savour as he spoke; "she dropped down
upon us from the skies. I had never heard Miss Ross mention her name
until one day, going out of the studio, I found 'a maiden sitting all
forlorn' on the staircase, with a portmanteau that a 'hamal' in
Constantinople would have looked at twice. She let me shoulder it for
her up the stairs, and that was the informal way in which we first
became acquainted."</p>

<p>"And I suppose you have seen a good deal of her since!" said Harry,
gloomily.</p>

<p>"That depends on what you call a good deal. If it were any one but
Miss Drew I might say yes. Being Miss Drew, I feel I have seen very
little of her. She is amazingly reticent too--so a good deal in any
case would only go for a little. What I'm mostly afraid of is that
she's only here as an 'oiseau sur la branche'--'a beautiful bird of
passage,' in short, as I said before. Some day she will fly away as she
came. She never says a word about herself, either," and with his pipe
between his lips Mr. Eames concluded:</p>

<pre>
  "'Quand ell' s' balladait sous l' ciel bleu
   Avec ses ch'veux couleur de feu
   On croyait voir une aur&eacute;ole
    A Batignolles.'
</pre>

<p>That is really the colour of her hair, you know."</p>

<p>"She doesn't look as though she had been used to the kind of life
Anna will induct her into," observed Harry.</p>

<p>"Neither has she; she has roughed it, she told me, but in a
different way. She comes from Australia, you know; that accounts for
her being a little crude sometimes; but even her crudity has a charm of
its own. You haven't told me what you think of her yet."</p>

<p>"Of Miss Drew!" said Harry, jesuitically. "My good fellow, I can't
form an opinion of a woman whom I've hardly seen."</p>

<p>"You've seen enough of her to form an opinion of her looks," I
should think.</p>

<p>"Of her looks. Oh! she's good-looking enough, if that's what you
mean."</p>

<p>"What a cold-blooded, unappreciative fellow you are. Well! you may
do the amiable to Anna Ross by-and-by if you choose, only leave the
'bird of passage' to me."</p>

<p>And in the belief that his friend was totally unimpressed by the
graces that he himself saw with clearer eyes every day, he conducted
Harry, with a light heart, to Clootz's.</p>

<h3>Chapter XVII</h3>

<pre>
  "A party of pleasure, a party of four.
   Too few if one less, and too many if more." 
</pre>

<p>THESE words occurred to Mr. Eames's mind, with a mournful sense of
their inappropriateness to the occasion, as he threaded his way through
the turmoil of the Rue de la Gaiet&eacute;, towards the famous
caf&eacute; chantant of the same name, by Anna's side, while Harry and
the supposed Miss Drew followed at a respectful distance. Even a party
of three would be preferable, he thought, when one of the three
happened to be the right one. It was a singular fact, too, that after
the almost officious display of indifference his friend had manifested
towards the "beautiful bird of passage" to whom he had been recently
introduced, he should have contrived, nevertheless, and apparently by
accident, to fall behind with her as soon as they left the restaurant.
Though to Miss Ross one part of Paris was just the same as another, and
though he believed her capable of walking fearlessly about in such
uncanny places as the Boulevards ext&eacute;rieurs, regardless even of
the hideous presence of the professional rodeurs de barri&egrave;res,
he knew that it was not the same with her companion. Miss Drew still
shrank involuntarily when she found herself in the noisy workmen's
quarters of the Gaiet&eacute; Montparnasse, where blouses and sabots
might be said to hold the haut du pav&eacute;, for all the share of it
they gave the passers-by of gentler associations. She would retreat
into the middle of the street before the advance of some tipsy Coupeau
staggering out of the shop of a marchand de vin, and the person
accompanying her at such a time might possibly gain the inestimable
privilege of having her place her hand within his arm for protection.
Mr. Eames, it is needless to say, would fain have been that privileged
person; but though Miss Ross walked defiantly on, keeping her place on
the trottoir with a grim determination not to be pushed off it by all
the voyous in Paris, and though his presence was, as he well knew,
entirely superfluous upon the occasion, he could not pay her the
questionable compliment of leaving her to prove her independence alone.
His misgivings, however, were not allayed by perceiving, every time he
glanced round in Miss Drew's direction, that the ice was apparently
broken between her new friend and herself. He had imagined at the
outset that, in accordance with spiritualistic theories, their auras
must be antagonistic, and he had regretted the
circumstance--moderately--for he would have liked them to be friends in
reason. But now another fear, and a keener, had taken possession of his
soul. To walk as they were doing just now, with their heads inclined
towards each other, they must have hit upon some wonderfully congenial
topic since they had left Clootz's, at which place he had noticed that
they had hardly exchanged a word. Now the whole distance from Clootz's
to the caf&eacute; was not a mile: therefore the spontaneity of the
sympathy was, to say the least of it, disquieting.</p>

<p>Harry had, however, the best of reasons, though Mr. Eames was all
unaware of them, for waiving initiatory formalities when he found
himself for a few moments in the unhampered enjoyment of Miss Drew's
society. By a kind of mutual understanding, he and Portia had
successfully evaded the manoeuvres whereby her gentleman-help sought to
remain by her side as they left Clootz's. And as it is impossible for
four people to walk abreast in the evening in the Rue de la
Gaiet&eacute;, it followed that, by calmly maintaining his place and
ignoring all his friend's transparent efforts to oust him from it,
Harry had all the advantage on his side, for he was enabled to fall
slowly behind with his companion. Once the others were separated from
him by ever so short a distance, he might speak without fear. In the
midst of the foreign crowd he and his companion were as much alone for
all conversational purposes as though they had been on a desert island.
They might, indeed, have shouted State secrets or talked treason in
each other's ears, had they been so inclined, without anybody's being
the wiser.</p>

<p>But State secrets and treason would not have had half the effect
upon Harry of the few timid words uttered, as soon as they found
themselves alone, by the girl who walked next to him. Portia plunged
recklessly and without preamble into the heart of her subject--the most
interesting one in the world to Harry; since it concerned herself; and
if he had cherished her half-confidences before, the sensation with
which he received her fuller confidences now, and the rapture of
deducing therefrom that she must in part have divined the nature of the
sentiment he had given her unsought, may be imagined by all who have
known what it is at some period of their lives to worship "a bright
particular star, and think to wed it?"</p>

<p>"I want to thank you," Portia began hurriedly--the people she
encountered were pushing past her, and bearing down upon her, with the
swagger that is so true an expression of the mental attitude of a
certain type of ouvrier in Pairs; but Harry was there to clear a way
for her--"I want to thank you, while I have the opportunity, for not
seeming to know me in the Luxembourg this afternoon. I am hiding for a
little. I have good reasons for it. It isn't my own fault, indeed. You
may be sure of that. Anna knows all about it. But I don't want my
friends to know I am here. I have taken my mother's name to make more
sure. If Mr. Eames had seen that you knew me, he might have asked
questions--"</p>

<p>She caught her breath spasmodically between each sentence, and Harry
guessed that the effort of controlling her emotion was severe. There
was something in her tones that suggested a risk of her breaking into a
sob between the pauses. To have answered her with any kind of ceremony,
or other than straight from his heart, feeling as he did at this
moment, would have been impossible to him.</p>

<p>"It is I who thank you for trusting me," he said earnestly; it was
necessary to speak very close in her ear in the midst of the jostling,
unyielding crowd, and this was just the moment that Mr. Eames chose for
taking observations in the rear. "I know we have only met a very few
times, but each time has counted for so much in my life. I venture to
tell you this, though I would not have dared to so soon under any other
circumstances. Only I am so grateful to you for trusting me, and I
should be so much more grateful if you would let me help you. I have
not the least idea how you are placed; but, you see, I have the
strongest motives a man can have for wanting to help you. Will you tell
me what you can of your trouble? Even after our last meeting at the
Academy I did an unwarrantable thing. I had not seen you in the Park or
anywhere else for so long. I couldn't stand it any longer. I went to
your house to inquire. You were in Paris, they said; and soon after I
saw an announcement that you were married. It was only a few hours ago
that the wonderful idea that you were still free dawned upon me, when I
came upon you, as Miss Drew, in the Luxembourg."</p>

<p>"I am not free!" said Portia, in low tones. "I was married the day I
ran away!"</p>

<p>The announcement was followed by a dead silence. Harry had received
what is called, in pugilistic lore, a staggerer. The hope that had beat
so high an instant ago went out suddenly, leaving utter blackness
behind. The "one maid, by Heaven's grace," in all the world for him was
another man's wife. It was the bride of a week that he was wooing here
in this unholy atmosphere, in the midst of the stifling crowd. Do
battle for her he would, as he had pledged himself to do, but without
hope of guerdon. She would always be more to him than any other woman
in the world, but the "bright particular star" shining overhead in
attendance upon the pale moon was not farther removed from his sphere
than she. Some men, learning what he had learned, would have given vent
to an oath under their breath. Harry said nothing. Portia, on her side,
maintained an equal silence. There was nothing to add to her avowal.
She was chewing the cud of her own weakness and folly, and very bitter
it tasted. By what right had she trampled down the holy instinct that
had rendered John's arrival a terror to her the morning she returned
from the Academy, with her mind full of Harry's picture, and her heart
full of--But she had never owned that to herself before this evening. A
little resolution--a great deal of resolution even--for the united
wills of John and Wilmer and Emma made a barrier difficult to
overcome--might she not have called it to her aid when all her life's
happiness was at stake? Oh, if Harry had only spoken before! If,
instead of looking his sympathy as he bade her good-bye in crowded
Piccadilly, he had said the simple words "I love you!" her heart would
have responded instantly. She would not have lacked the courage to
fight her battle then. She would have gone armed and strong to the
contest. But he had given her no such weapon to fight with. He had
shown her a picture that thrust itself into the foreground, and him
into the background. And she had been given no time for resistance,
hardly time for resignation, before her fate had been sealed. And
nothing but those dreary words "it might have been"--"the saddest," as
the poet has told us, "of all the sad words of tongue or pen"--remained
for her to fall back upon now.</p>

<p>They had been making their way along a line of cheap shops and
stalls, whence the acrid odours of pommes frites hissing in rancid fat,
of slopped--over counters at the marchands de vin, mingled with the
fumes of cigars at two for a sou, filled the air. Harry thought
bitterly that it was a fitting background for the snuffing out of his
love idyll. But, after the first sharp pang of personal disappointment,
pity for the woman by his side overcame his egoistic suffering. It must
be a dire tragedy in a young life that could drive a bride from the
bridegroom's arms on the day that consecrated their union. And he had
promised to help her. It might be that there were wrongs to redress,
or, if redress were no longer possible, to avenge. In a few moments
more the opportunity for speaking would be gone--perhaps for ever. Mr.
Eames, who had never shown himself in so officious a light before, was
looking round, and pointing ahead of him along the street. At the
Gaiet&eacute; Montparnasse there would be no possibility of exchanging
a word. He hardly regretted now that the crowd should push against them
so roughly. It gave him an excuse for loitering behind, and saying all
that remained to be said. The silence that had seemed so long had
endured perhaps only a few seconds before he was replying to her
words:</p>

<p>"That's about as bad a piece of news as you could give me; it's no
use telling you how I feel about it. The question is, can anything be
done to help you? I suppose you didn't run away on your wedding-day
without having a reason for it!"</p>

<p>"I had a reason." Her voice had regained its wonted calm, and every
word fell distinctly on her hearer's understanding. "The very day I was
married, and just as I was on the point of going away with--with my
husband, a woman came with a little baby. She told me my husband did
not belong to me at all--that he belonged by rights to her. The little
baby was theirs," she said. "She was the woman whom you had put into
your picture of the Madonna. I understood, when I saw her, why it
seemed to me that I must have seen something that reminded me of that
picture when you showed it me for the first time. The eyes you had
painted--the baby's eyes, you know--are so exactly like those of--of my
husband."</p>

<p>"But he isn't your husband at all, thank God!" exclaimed Harry,
eagerly. "He's only a miserable impostor! He need never cross your path
again unless you choose. Why did you run away? Were you afraid to
denounce him? Did you--did you care for him?"</p>

<p>His voice sank as he asked the question, but Portia heard it and
understood. Her answer nevertheless was slow in coming. If she should
say Yes, she would be telling an untruth; if she said No, what must he
think of her? What would any man think of a woman who would go in cold
blood to the altar to swear eternal love to a man for whom she cared
nothing?</p>

<p>"I thought I cared for him," she said at last, employing the same
subterfuge as she had had recourse to in her communings with herself.
"We had been engaged almost since I was a little girl, and he had come
from Australia on purpose to marry me. Everything was changed when I
found out the truth."</p>

<p>"And you found it out directly you came out of the church?" insisted
Harry, in a husky, eager voice strangely unlike his usual measured
utterance, "What a Heaven-sent miracle of salvation that was!"</p>

<p>He took off his hat for an instant, and wiped his forehead, round
which the perspiration was pearling in thick beads.</p>

<p>"I was getting ready to go away upon my wedding trip with Mr.
Morrisson, when Mary came and stopped me," Portia explained; but Harry
interrupted her sharply:</p>

<p>"Morrisson! Is that the man's name? My model called herself Mrs.
Morris."</p>

<p>"Did she?" The words that came next dealt a fresh stab to her
hearer's heart. "I am afraid it would not have been so easy to stay
behind after all and denounce him, as you say I should have done. For I
don't think somehow the woman--was--was married to him at all. He had
promised to marry her, and that seems just as binding in reality. But
by law he was married to me. I was afraid they might force me to go on
being his wife if I stayed behind, so I just ran away."</p>

<p>"What! You ran away alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite alone; but I knew that Anna would take me in, and that
she would hide me until we had decided what I should do. She is a very
good friend."</p>

<p>"Y--yes," assented Harry, doubtfully. "I am sure she means to be;
but she has her own way of interpreting social obligations. It's
unusual, to say the least of it."</p>

<p>"They are signing to us to come," interrupted Portia, hastily. "Let
me just say thank you once more."</p>

<p>"If there were only something to thank me for. Tell me, could you
not be in the Luxembourg, just where we met you to-day, at the same
hour to--morrow? I have such a great wish to be of use to you if I
can."</p>

<p>"I will try. Only please don't let them think we have been talking
about anything out of the way now."</p>

<p>Her injunction did not come too soon. Mr. Eames had retraced his
steps, and was hastening towards them as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Miss Ross's orders are that you hurry up," he said. "I give the
message verbatim. It seems that there is a new programme on to-night.
Gar&ccedil;on inaugurates his latest 'Ca la fait rire,' and all the
best places are taken."</p>

<p>"You needn't stay longer than you like," whispered Harry to his
companion, as Mr. Eames elbowed a way for her through the crowd. "Only
make me a sign when you are tired."</p>

<p>She nodded. They had rejoined Anna by this time and found her
standing as though rooted to one spot, with an expression upon her face
that seemed to say not all the powers of darkness and the Quartier
Montparnasse combined should cause her to budge from it.</p>

<p>"How you dawdled!" she said to her friend. "We'd better make haste
in now," and she led the way through a broad, covered passage that
conducted into the body of the building. Portia found herself, as soon
as the glare of the gas and the haze of the tobacco-smoke allowed her
to take stock of her surroundings, in a small theatre of shabby
appointments. Just as she had felt upon her first introduction to
Clootz's, she felt here now. If she had dared to exercise her private
right of judgment, very more than rather awful would have most
appropriately rendered her impressions. The spectators were on a par
with the theatre--not that they were shabby, but they were dressed for
the most part in the garments in which they earned their livelihood by
the "sweat of their brow"; and the fact was patent to more than one of
her senses. Some were ambulant vendors of oranges, crevettes, and other
street delicacies. Others--the aristocracy these--belonged to the
petit-bourgeois order, and were mostly habitu&eacute;s of the
Gaiet&eacute;. Sometimes their wives accompanied them; more frequently
the wife remained away to mind the shop. There was a scattered
contingent of grisettes--not unaccompanied--and a sprinkling of
students and artists, with or without the latter. The seats that Anna
found were a little behind the orchestra, and, having a broad ledge in
front of them, conveyed a grotesque suggestion to Portia's mind of pews
in a church. There were no prayer-books, however, only consommations of
divers kinds--bocks, mazagrans, and petits verres ranged thereupon.</p>

<p>"You'll have to take something," Anna explained to her as they sat
down. "Would you like to taste what absinthe is like? You need only put
your lips to it."</p>

<p>"Oh, please not," cried Portia, "I'll have coffee, with milk in it."
The coffee was brought in a long tumbler. It bore a very medicinal
appearance, and was accompanied by three slabs of unsweetening sugar
that seemed to have been provided to take the taste away. The party of
four was seated in a row, Portia between her two admirers. Mr. Eames,
to make up for time wasted, addressed all his conversation to her. The
orchestra was playing the waltz from Madame Angot as they entered, and
the curtain was up, displaying a tawdry stage, with faded draperies in
the background. Portia had never seen a music-hall performance of any
kind before. When an ingenuous-looking youth with an occasional twist
of the mouth that signified unutterable things came on the stage and
proceeded to sing a dozen verses with the invariable refrain of "Sije
connaissais mon papa," and when he set forth in detail the various
indulgences he would allow himself could the words of the refrain be
realized, she laughed out loud and thought the performance exceedingly
funny, without in the least comprehending the drift of it. Her
na&iuml;ve enjoyment of it delighted Mr. Eames. Harry, on the contrary,
looked as John Knox might have looked when he was thundering in Mary's
presence against the French levity of her blood. The scabreux element
in the Gaiet&eacute; songs, which was the salt of the entertainment to
the rest of the audience, repelled and disgusted him. Without that
element they were fade and meaningless. It distressed him to see Portia
laughing in the innocence of her heart at jokes of which the hidden
meaning would have revolted her had she been capable of understanding
it. And what an epilogue her appearance here was to her marriage! A
week-old bride, fresh from her girlhood's home, seated between two men
who were both intent upon wooing her, laughing at utterances that she
should have ignored all her life, in company with a crowd who set her
down in all likelihood as the mistress of one or of both. Allowance
must be made for Harry if he exaggerated the situation in his mind. He
had worshipped this woman next to him as the incarnation of a dream of
innocent purity, and it hurt and angered him beyond endurance to see
the white wings of his divinity smirched by contact with the gross
things of earth.</p>

<p>The next song pleased Portia even better. The singer was a woman,
who, though very plump, looked still very young, and who wore an
expression of artless innocence which was almost angelic. She sang of
an interview with "Monsieur le Cur&eacute;," and though the air was
undeniably pretty, since Portia understood very little French, and
could follow none of the words, it was somewhat of a bewilderment to
her to see the audience laugh so boisterously at it. This was followed
by a performance which was a relief to Harry's overstrained feelings.
Like the dish of sugared rose-leaves that Eastern epicures insert in a
succession of highly-seasoned plats, it turned upon birds and
springtime--upon bucolic joys and pastoral pleasures. It was sung by an
elegantly dressed lady and had a succ&egrave;s d'estime. Harry
expressed his satisfaction for the first time, but relapsed into moody
silence a moment later when the far-famed Gar&ccedil;on made his
appearence, and was hailed with derisive shouts of welcome from the
audience. Gar&ccedil;on's r&ocirc;le was to look like a fool, and he
was dressed accordingly. He wore a red wig, and trousers that were too
short for him. His face, which was blonde and shaven, had an expression
of mingled imbecility and ruse that was in itself a triumph of art. He
could put on an air of naivet&eacute; that was almost pathetic in its
intensity, and could condense such volumes of suggestion into a mere
quivering of the eyelid that his least gesture was the signal for a
laugh. Gar&ccedil;on's song of the evening had a refrain called "Ca la
fait rire," and described his wooing and wedding of a certain
Josephine. It was boisterously encored--and at the end of it Harry shot
a rapid glance in the direction of his neighbour. Portia had laughed
delightedly at Gar&ccedil;on's face at the outset, but now she was
looking away with a grave and somewhat terrified expression. Despite
the heat, her cheeks and even her lips were pale. Mr. Eames was
affecting to be engrossed in his programme. Gar&ccedil;on had
soulign&eacute;'d his song in a way that, even to the comprehension of
an utterly unversed and unsuspecting person like our heroine, conveyed
a hint of its turbid depths, and Portia had been seized with a sudden
misgiving.</p>

<p>"Haven't you had almost enough of this?" Harry said shortly to his
neighbour. "I think your friend has."</p>

<p>"Take her away, then," replied Miss Ross, without looking round. "I
will follow when I please."</p>

<p>"Miss Ross thinks you are looking tired," was his next observation,
addressed this time to Portia; he had ventured upon a free translation
of Anna's words; "and so I think you are. Won't you let me see you
home? It isn't really worth stopping in this bad air for, is it?"</p>

<p>"By the bye, I ought to be in too; I have no end of letters to
write," observed Mr. Eames, jumping up suddenly. "I can see Miss Drew
back, if she will let me. I know this thing from end to end. You'd
better see it out with Miss Ross, Tolhurst."</p>

<p>"Thanks!" said Harry, grimly; he tried to put himself in his
friend's place, and to remember that, in the ignorance in which the
latter remained of the real aspect of the case, his conduct in
attempting to monopolise Miss Drew's society must appear like that of
an impertinent interloper. And Eames had confided in him too--had
hinted that he was on the point of losing his heart to Miss Ross's
friend, if he had not lost it already. Nevertheless, Harry was loth to
see the pair depart together, and his hesitation was so apparent that
Anna said indignantly, "I won't have one of you three remain. If you
do, I shall go--and I don't want to be driven away. I will come back
when I please and as I please."</p>

<p>"You must let one of us stay to see you home," urged Harry,
reluctantly.</p>

<p>"To see me home! Poor little dear!" No reasoned refutation could
have been half so convincing as the briefly-uttered mocking rejoinder,
into which she infused all the scorn that stirred her soul. "You do
look tired, child," she observed, as Portia turned round to smile
farewell at her. "Take a cup of tea when you get back--you may give
them some too," nodding in the direction of the two young men, who
stood up in eager readiness to bear her away. "And keep the kettle on,
will you? I dare say I shall bring Rousky back with me."</p>

<p>The party of three did not prove much more satisfactory, after all,
than the party of four, to Mr. Eames's thinking. Harry said but little,
certainly; his presence made it impossible to talk of other than
indifferent subjects. No allusion was made to the place they had left.
Portia felt a sudden and unaccountable diffidence in referring to it.
The only thing it suggested to her mind was a dim recollection of a
childish experience she had had years ago when she had run to pluck a
beautiful rose-bough in the Yarraman garden. As she stretched out her
hand for the rose a cluster of caterpillar larvae, one moving mass of
black corruption, curled and wriggled round the stem. She had burst
into tears and run away. Besides the disgust inspired by the larvae,
there was the degradation of the poor rose to afflict her. The tuneful
singing she had heard a while ago made her think of this experience
anew. But it was not a thing to be discussed aloud. She invited her two
escorts into Anna's room--and despite the letters that Mr. Eames had on
his mind, he eagerly responded to the invitation.</p>

<h3>Chapter XVIII</h3>

<p>IT was under the shelter of the effigy of one of the earlier French
queens, clad in the stiff, cumbersome garments of her time, beneath the
stone presentment of which the chisel of even a French sculptor had
been unable to suggest the existence of a woman's form, that Portia had
her promised interview with Harry the next day. Early as she had
arrived at the trysting place, he was there before her. She had
recognized him from afar off, as she advanced slowly, with a step that
spoke of inward trepidation, towards the bench upon which he was
seated. In accepting his offer of help, as in promising to see him
alone, she was doing nothing for which her conscience need smite her.
Yet so unused was Portia to anything that savoured of deception, that
even this innocent cachotterie set her trembling. There was no one to
watch her here, no one to whom she need feel herself accountable for
her comings and goings. Yet there was such a startled expression in her
eyes of curious hue, those eyes that Harry knew so well and thought of
so often, that the sight of them moved him with pity. Her manner had
none of the confident buoyancy that had marked it when she mounted the
Academy steps radiant, and smiling a few weeks ago. She wore what
seemed to him a haunted look, and to reassure her he essayed to speak
of commonplace subjects in the easy tones of one who meets
unpremeditatedly a mere casual acquaintance.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" he shook her hand cordially.</p>

<p>"Isn't it a lovely afternoon for sitting out under the trees? I have
found such a pleasant seat over there. I was looking up through the
branches of the yellow leaves hidden in the green. Have you ever seen
an autumn in the Luxembourg?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied; she was beginning to feel a little more at her
ease now, and she took her seat by his side on the bench. "I have seen
only one autumn in Europe, but it seemed to me almost too wonderful to
be real. We have no autumn in Australia, you know. We were travelling
through Switzerland. It was the end of October, and the Alps were
covered with snow to their base. The trees--those tell Lombardy
poplars--had lost none of their leaves, but they had turned a golden
yellow all over. The weather was lovely, and the sky was a shining
blue. When I saw the golden trees growing out of the dazzling white
snow, I thought it too wonderful--I could not have believed a landscape
could ever come to to look like that."</p>

<p>"I know the effect you speak of," Harry said, musing. "Out of the
thousand autumn picture one sees, I have never seen that particular
combination exactly rendered. I think, though, the most gorgeous autumn
scene I ever beheld was on the shores of the Bosphorus. You have been
to Constantinople? No! Then I don't know how I am to give you any idea
in words of the riotous medley of colours you see from a distance."</p>

<p>He essayed nevertheless, warming to his subject as he recalled every
marvellous detail of the brilliant panorama, bright and many-hued as a
parrot's wing. Portia listened in silence. She had forgotten for the
moment the chain that bound her. She was walking in imagination through
the enchanted scenes Harry was word-painting for her, scenes that had
not existed for her hitherto, save in the pages of the Arabian Nights
or of Lalla Rookh, the two sources whence she had drawn, it is to be
feared, her principal knowledge of an Oriental mise-en-sc&egrave;ne. A
sense of the boundless delights the world had to offer to two minds in
entire sympathy grew upon her as she listened. And the possibility of
such joys as these had been within her reach!--she would have had but
to stretch out her hand to grasp it at the very moment when she had
deliberately and recklessly flung it away! For a moment she could have
wished that, like Anna, she had asserted her right to do as she pleased
before marriage instead of after it. The artist band in Paris would
soon be dispersing now, and each would go his separate way without let
or hindrance. Why, even if the Swedish girls and her friend should go
to Constantinople, no one would say them nay, and on their return they
would find the same atelier, the same table at Clootz's, the same
interests and associations open to them as before. Perhaps Anna was
right, after all. It was the people themselves who spoiled the world,
either by violence, or by restrictions, or by interference with each
other's movements; and it was only those who heeded none of these
things, and who went their own ways, who could find any satisfaction in
living.</p>

<p>Reflections of this nature brought Portia back to the actual
circumstances of her position. It was one thing to wander in fancy with
Harry against an intangible Oriental background, and quite another to
be found with Mr. Tolhurst against the actual background of the
Luxembourg Gardens. Despite Anna's "live and let live" principle, she
would not have cared to see her cross the gardens just now. Portia felt
herself, indeed, something of a traitress to her friend, for had she
not come out this afternoon to take counsel of another all unknown to
her?</p>

<p>"After what you said last night," she began, suddenly and
irrelevantly, as she traced unconscious patterns on the gravel-path at
her feet with the point of her parasol (many a hieroglyph drawn by the
point of a woman's parasol is the unenduring record of some paramount
passage in her life's history), "I know I need not be afraid to tell
you everything and to ask you what you think I had better do."</p>

<p>She paused irresolute, her eyes still fixed upon the ground. Harry,
for his part, was hanging on her every word. He could not see her face,
for she persisted in keeping her head down, but he had a view of the
lower half of her charming profile, and his imagination filled up the
remainder. He had known he loved her from the beginning; but in
accordance with the irony of Fate, he must needs be deprived of the
opportunity of avowing it until just after she had contracted marriage
with another man. Meeting her during the crisis that followed, he must
find himself in the position of her counsellor and mentor, instead of
her wooer, and must force himself to give her the very same advice that
he would have given to a cherished sister under like circumstances.
Here, at least, was his clearly defined duty, but it was a duty that
promised to be all the harder of fulfilment, that something in Portia's
manner seemed to tell him that if she had still possessed her freedom
he would not have wooed her in vain. That was a maddening thought for a
man situated as he was. Portia, in asking him to decide for her, was
surrendering herself virtually into his hands. Her action in marrying a
man she did not love simply because she had no power to resist
surrounding influences, her flight immediately after the marriage, and
her helplessness and irresolution when the flight was accomplished--all
this seemed to prove to him that she was without the moral support
known as backbone (an appropriate designation, since it is only with
the vertebrates that the faculty of resisting our environments seems to
have been evolved). He had suspected as much before, but he did not
love her the less for it. He would have had backbone enough for both if
he could have made her his wife. He reproached himself bitterly in
secret with his faint-heartedness upon the memorable day when he had
shown her his picture of the Madonna. Perhaps that day had been the
turning-point in their lives, and he had not known how to seize it. Yet
how could he have imagined that she was about to slip out of his life
for ever? They had been such entire friends that morning--it would have
seemed almost an easy matter to say to her then, "You know I love you!
do you not? and I want you to be my wife, if you will." But he had not
dared to say it. He had allowed worldly considerations to weigh with
him. He was not so sure of making his mark then as he felt now. Portia
was spoken of as an heiress, and he had nothing but his art and his
work to set against her fortune. People would have said that he had
taken undue advantage of the first chance of winning the heiress that
had fallen in his way. He had been moved by considerations which after
all would have been reasonable enough under ordinary circumstances. Yet
it required no little effort to remember at this moment how he was
situated towards Portia, and to give her the counsel that honour and
duty demanded he should give her. "What do you think I had better do?"
she had asked, and her words echoed through his brain, and raised a
strange tumult in his heart. He felt that he had only to say, "Of
course, you must stay where you are," and in a very short time, in a
school like Anna's--under an influence like Anna's--he might persuade
her of his Heaven-sent right to become all in all to her. And, once he
had persuaded her of this, legal formalities might be deferr&eacute;d
for subsequent regulation. Her relations would move Heaven and earth,
or rather the Church and the State, to have her union with him properly
ratified, and to have the other meaningless ceremony annulled. But let
her return to England now, and all their influence and power would be
employed to force her back into the unholy bonds that she had been
driven into against her will at the outset.</p>

<p>"You ask me what you are to do," he said at last slowly; he would
not avow that he shrank from the responsibility laid upon him. "Will
you answer me one question first? Supposing you were convinced that the
man you married most bitterly repented the sin that drove you away from
him--supposing this woman, Mrs. Morris, or whatever she calls herself,
could be spirited away, right away, no matter where--would you still
have the some horror of returning to your husband? Would you want to
separate your life from his under any circumstances? I am more anxious
then I can say to advise you for the best. I thought I must be dreaming
yesterday when I came upon you suddenly in the Luxembourg; but
afterwards, as I thought over your story in the night, the dream seemed
to turn into a nightmare. I can advise you up to a certain point, but
your own feelings are what you should consult before all. If this
obstacle had not arisen, the thought of running away would never have
entered into your head."</p>

<p>He made this assertion doubtfully, almost interrogatively. Portia
continued to trace patterns with the point of her parasol. The first
autumn leaves were fluttering down upon her in the soft evening
breeze.</p>

<p>"I had thought of doing it before," she said at last, in a scarcely
audible voice; "but never after I was once married."</p>

<p>Pleasant sounds were wandering to the bench where they sat. The
distant babble of children's voices, the twittering of the fearless
sparrows, the mingled cadence of falling water and rustling leaves, all
these would have made a soothing accompaniment to the beating of a
peaceful heart. But Harry's heart was far from being peaceful.
Disappointment unspeakable was causing it to ache and throb. He loved
this woman by his side. She was weak beyond all believing. She had
allowed herself to be married almost in spite of herself. There were
none of the elements of a Bride of Lammermoor in her nature.
Nevertheless he loved her. Her personality had a charm for him that set
all reasoning at defiance. Her very weakness attracted him. How
entirely she would have leaned upon him if he could have won her for
himself, to have and to hold till death parted him from her. But now it
was his bounden duty to send her away from him. The longer she stayed
with Anna, the more critical her position would become. There were
dangers around her of which she could have no understanding. Even as it
was, would not the shadow of her rash action hang like a dark cloud
over all her future life? Moreover, there was the moral aspect of the
question to be considered. Had she not taken upon herself solemn vows
in the most solemn place in the world? Harry Tolhurst possessed what is
known as the religious temperament. The fact that the marriage rite had
been actually performed was one that had great weight with him. The
evening before he had supposed for an instant that Portia's husband had
committed bigamy, in which event her own share in the vows she had
taken would have counted for nothing. But the marriage, as he now knew,
was a valid one, and the religious service could not be gainsaid. He
reviewed the case rapidly in his mind before he said gently, but
firmly:</p>

<p>"Then you had counted the cost! And the discovery you made after
your marriage is all we have to think of."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so." There was something hopelesely despondent in
her manner of assent. "I thought we might arrange something here; but
it does not seem like it now. Anna wants me to stay with her at all
costs. She wants me to become a model"--Harry fancied he could detect a
slight tremor in her voice--"but I don't see my way. I feel as though I
were drifting, as though I were rudderless--if you can understand."</p>

<p>"Indeed I can;" his tones were full of sympathy. "I was on board a
ship once that had lost her rudder. There is always great danger of
drifting on to the rocks. Now, if you will let me advise, I think you
ought to go home directly. Go and put yourself under your brother's
protection. You seem to have run away just to escape from a position in
which you felt yourself helpless to act. But when you go back things
will have arranged themselves, There is no risk of your being forced to
act now without due time for reflection. And you will be safer there
than here. Believe me you will. Miss Ross's home is no place for
you."</p>

<p>All the time he was urging her to depart, his heart was crying out
to him to bid her remain. But for the very reason that he was doing a
violence to his secret desires, his spoken words were vehement. Portia
could have no conception of the extent to which she tried him by her
reply.</p>

<p>"Then I know how it will all end!" she said piteously. "John cares
for me terribly" (it was the first time he had heard her speak of her
husband as John); "he will never hear of anything but my returning to
him, and he will have talked the others over by now."</p>

<p>To this Harry made no rejoinder until he had gathered strength
sufficient to say, "Even that would be better than following out Anna's
plan of life--I think."</p>

<p>"Do you think so? Oh! I wish you could hear her talk!" She paused,
and continued rapidly, without looking at him, "Unless people come
together from sheer love of each other, and only stay together just as
long as the want to do so is there, it is all wrong and unnatural, she
says. She talks about it so wonderfully sometimes; I wish you could
hear her."</p>

<p>"Oh! I know the free love doctrine," Harry said grimly. "Listen."
Portia raised her head in astonishment, his voice and manner were
solemn. "I am going to speak to you, if I can, as father, brother,
lover--all in one. For I want you to understand that I love you better
than myself. Do you know that if it were to any one but me you quoted
Anna's words, you would be doing a very risky thing? People might not
understand. Supposing I were to take advantage of the fact that you are
Anna's disciple to uphold her doctrine to you on my own account. Do you
know where it would lead us? It would lead, in the first place, to my
trying to compass your ruin. If love and inclination are to be the only
arbiters; if honour and duty and self--control are to have no say in
the matter at all, what is to prevent my acting upon the impulse that
moves me now? What is to prevent my entreating you to try and care for
me a little? Why should I not say, Forget all the ghastly business of
the other day, and let us begin a new life together here. Don't look
terrified" (for Portia had turned a face of pale astonishment towards
him), "I care for you too truly to say it"--his voice was trembling
with agitation. "I care for you for yourself, my dear. That means, that
I set too great a value upon your peace of mind, and your reputation,
to ever want you to fling them away for me. There are things that count
for more than love--"</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly. Portia's eyes were suffused. He felt that his
resolution was giving way. If she continued to look at him like that it
would abandon him altogether; or, rather, it would expend itself in
words, while, in obedience to the overmastering instinct that stirred
him, his arm would steal round her neck, and his lips would seek
hers.</p>

<p>But Portia had lowered her eyes again. "I know why you speak like
that," she said. "You are thinking of what is to come afterwards--after
we are dead, I mean."</p>

<p>"Yes!" he replied. "I believe in a future, too. I think we are
called upon most often to climb the steep and thorny path to
Heaven."</p>

<p>"But if one did not think that!" she was transfixing the withered
leaves at her feet with her parasol, and sweeping them over the
hieroglyphs on the gravel.</p>

<p>"If one did not think that," he repeated. But his voice changed;
Anna and Mr. Eames, walking side by side, were advancing towards them
under the trees. The dissatisfaction of the latter was apparent in his
step. It is not only the facial muscles; every muscle of the body
expresses moods--witness the difference in the outline, however
distant, of a boy on his way to be caned, and the same boy out for a
holiday.</p>

<p>"Found at last!" said Anna, triumphantly. There was a mocking gleam
in her black eyes as Portia rose in confusion to greet her. "See, I
have a telegram for you. I dare say it's only a device on the part of
your friends to get you away."</p>

<p>The message delivered into Portia's hands had been through double
forms. Addressed in the first instance to the suburban post-office in
London where Anna's friend called for the letters she transmitted to
the runaway, it had been re-telegraphed by her to Paris. Portia ran her
eyes over it hurriedly. The signature which caught her eye first was
Eliza's and the message was to the following effect:</p>

<p>"Come back. Mary Willet run over; not expected to live. Wants you
immediately."</p>

<p>Portia to the profound and jealous astonishment of Mr. Eames, put
this dispatch into Harry's hands at once. She had turned pale to the
lips as she read the contents. Harry felt that some explanation was due
to the others.</p>

<p>"We have found out," he said hurriedly, "that we have a
friend--Miss--er--Drew and I whom we are both in Paris to assist. I
suppose," he added, turning gravely to her, "you will go to her at
once--won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; oh, yes!" There was sharp distress in her tones. "I will leave
for England to-night."</p>

<h3>Chapter XIX</h3>

<p>PORTIA was not suffered to repeat the experience that attended her
flight from London, as she took her hurried departure from Paris a few
hours later. Four people saw her off at the Gare du Nord by the night
train for Calais. Mr. Eames, who sadly realised that his designation of
her as a beautiful bird of passage had been only too appropriate, was
among them. Neither he nor his friend, between whom and himself a
marked coldness had sprung up, dared to put into execution a project
that both had secretly cherished of offering to escort her to London.
Portia was conscious of a slight sense of shame as she stood at the
window of the first-class ladies' compartment to wish her friends
good-bye. She felt that to indulge in luxurious travelling was a
backsliding; besides which Anna and Rousky scorned all save third-class
fares.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as the train moved smoothly off, to the satisfaction
of everybody (for the whole party, was fast relapsing into the
condition of mental vacuity that prolonged railway-station farewells
engender), she could not be indifferent to the fact that here at least
she might think over things in comfortable and cushioned solitude. The
news of Mary's accident had shocked her profoundly. It seemed as though
the mysterious message of Harry's Madonna had not been fully delivered
even yet. The final words had still to be spoken. Portia believed now
that from the first moment of beholding the picture she had recognised
the power that would henceforth control her destiny. At Mary's call she
had fled from her home; at the same call she was returning to it now.
On Mary's behoof she had put her husband away from her. What might she
not be called upon to do next! Her thoughts travelled backwards and
forwards between Anna's quairi&egrave;me and the rose-embowered
Kensington home. She reflected that only where a woman's affections are
fixed there can she cast her anchor. Perhaps it was the impossibility
of so fixing them that made Anna renounce all home ties and lead a
vagrant life. She had a dim suspicion that Anna dragged her anchor from
time to time, and that, despite her apparent indifference, she was one
of those whom the "howling winds," would drive devious, tempest-tossed
to the end of her days. This time there was no moonlit landscape to
mingle its fantastic glories with the dreams our heroine was weaving.
The reign of the August moon was over, and a warm darkness covered the
face of the earth. The tide of voyagers was setting from, not towards,
the English shores. Portia might have been wandering with ghosts
through an impalpable limbo for all the communion she held with her few
fellow-passengers on the journey. It was hardly past sunrise when she
arrived at Victoria Station and found herself once again under the
familiar overhung London sky. Her hair felt dank against her temples as
she drove to Kensington. The trees in the Park looked black and
drooping. Where was the radiant green, shining behind a shimmery silver
veil, that she remembered so well? She leaned back in her cab and
closed her eyes wearily. She could not have believed that all could
change so utterly above and around her, without and within, in so short
a space of time.</p>

<p>Portia had never so fully realised that she had put herself into the
position of an outcast as upon her return to her home at this early
hour of the day. As no one expected her, no one was up to receive her.
The cabman was obliged to hammer at the door and ring the area bell
persistently, with an oft-repeated "that'll bring 'em out!" before the
blue-and-silver footman, stripped of his distinguishing trappings,
proceeded to unlock and unchain the front door. The person to whom he
opened it scuttled past him with a short "Good morning, William!" to
her room. It annoyed her to feel sure that the first thing he would do
would be to clatter round to the servant's regions to give the news of
her return redhot. She found the door of her room locked, and it was
necessary to climb another storey to wake Nurse Eliza, who probably
kept the key. And Eliza, once awakened, would not let her go. Time had
been when Portia had crept into the faithful creature's bed upon
thundery nights at Yarraman, when the vision of the picture of devils
in Wilmer's illustrated copy of the Ingoldsby Legends, over the
words:</p>

<p>"Then did she reek, and squeak, and shriek.</p>

<p>With a wild, unearthly yell."</p>

<p>had recurred to her with disagreeable force every time the lightning
flashed. She recognised, just as of old, the row of light little plaits
into which Eliza was wont to twist her hair, to give it a wave the
following day.</p>

<p>"Did you plait up your hair the day I ran away, Eliza?" were her
first words, as she sat upon the edge of her nurse's bed, after she had
roused her by lightly kissing her upon the forehead.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me it's you come back!" cried Eliza, joyfully but
irrelevantly. "It's too good to be true."</p>

<p>"You knew I would be obliged to come when you sent me that message."
Portia had flung down her hat; her chestnut hair was ruffled into
softest disorder, and her face was pale with the mingled effects of her
night journey and the excitement of her home-coming. "Poor, poor Mary!
is it as bad as you thought?"</p>

<p>"It's very bad, my dear," Eliza made reply, sitting up in bed and
looking gravely at her; "but it hadn't ought to have been any business
of yours. Such goings on I never saw in my life! That Mary Willet
doesn't know what shame means; and her family so respectable, too! But
there, you was always too good-hearted. Don't I remember when you used
to cry fit to break your heart every time they were going to stick a
pig at the station!"</p>

<p>"Oh! never mind about the pig; tell me about Mary. When did she send
for me? Where is she? How did it happen? Who says she can't live?"</p>

<p>"Miss, I can't tell you everything all in a minute. I only know this
much: a woman came round here from Mary Willet's lodgings yesterday,
just as I was setting out the flowers for lunch. 'Mrs. Morris'--that's
the name the hussy gave herself--'Mrs. Morris has been run over,' she
says, 'and she can't die easy, she says, without Miss James goes to see
her.' Mr. James, he said I was to telegraph straight off to the place
where I used for to send your letters; and its just a chance they
called for the telegram and sent it off to you so soon, though I expect
you weren't very far off, if the truth were known."</p>

<p>"Far enough to take ten hours to get back. But I must go to Mary at
once!" cried Portia, springing from the bed. "She is expected to die,
you say, and here I sit doing nothing at all. I won't disturb the
others now. Give me her address, quick, and let me go."</p>

<p>She had been plunging a towel into the water-jug as she spoke, and
now passed it rapidly over her face. Her hat and veil were on in an
instant. "The address, Eliza!" she repeated impatiently.</p>

<p>"They've been and changed you, my dear!" said the nurse, dolefully.
"You're that headstrong, one 'ud never dream you was the same. Oh, the
address!"--for Portia was stamping her foot with impatience--"it's
Latimer Road somewhere--let me see--I put it into my purse. But
wherever has my purse got to? I thought I had it under my pillow, but
you put everything out of my head, being so impatient. Stay, though; I
remember now--it's 92 A or B: I can't remember which, but 92 I'll swear
to. I couldn't forget it, 'cause 'twas the number of my cabin on the
Ismail. But won't you just give me time to get up and go along with
you? I don't like to trust you out o'my sight any more, my dear!"</p>

<p>"I'll send for you if I want you. Don't keep me now, Eliza dear; and
tell them all--Emma and Wilmer, I mean--that I shall be back soon."</p>

<p>Precipitate departures seemed to enter now into the normal order of
events in Portia's life. The tale told by the unfrocked footman would
have received no credence had it not been for the presence in the hall
of the valise and saddle-bag, which (failing a gentleman-help) it was
nobody's business to carry upstairs at this unseemly hour. The owner of
them had departed, and, judging by the manner of her former
disappearance, there was no saying when she would return. As she left
the house, Portia realised that here, too, all was changed, and that
the old, happy, unthinking existence she had led in it was a thing of
the past. Even if John should pass out of her life forever, things
could never be the same again. But would he pass out of it? As far as
practical results went, her flight to Paris had been little better than
the famous expedition of the King of Spain who went up a hill and then
came down again. She had run away irresolute, and irresolute she
returned. But meanwhile this, at least, had been gained, that John's
sin had found him out.</p>

<p>It was only seven o'clock still, and Portia had many steps to walk
before she encountered a cab. In Paris at this hour all the world was
astir. This was Anna's sweeping morning, and Portia could picture her
with the towel pinned square over her swarthy brow, looking like the
last of the Pharaohs, as she sternly wielded her broom. The cab stopped
at the door of a trim--looking house, with a pathway in white
flagstones leading through the little front garden. A bare-armed maid
was "hearthstoning" the flags on her knees. The blinds were up upon the
first storey, whence Portia concluded, before she descended from the
cab, that the worst was not yet to be feared. She ran up the steps,
overcome by the sick, half-sinking sensation that the apprehension of
bodily suffering to ourselves or to others is wont to bring with it.
The bare-armed maid had silently pushed open the front door (standing
ajar) for her to enter, and, in answer to the trembling inquiry, "Mrs.
Morris?" was about to lead her through the short entrance-hall, and up
the staircase at the farther end, when a man's form was seen descending
the stairs. Portia shrank back with a gesture of dismay. The man was
John: he had recognised her, and was coming down the stairs to meet
her.</p>

<p>Situations that we picture to ourselves as necessarily impressive
and tragic are often very tame and trite in real life. It is the
feeling which accompanies them, not the words that are uttered, which
gives them their true significance. That is why the commonplace phrases
that Ibsen puts into the mouths of his characters, at the moment when
they perform their most tragic deeds, lend such ghastly reality to his
dramas. The step from the sublime to the ridiculous is stumbled across
most easily when our nerves are most highly strung. The slippers of
Hedda Gabler's husband thrust themselves in some form or another upon
all our most dramatic experiences.</p>

<p>Portia shrank back as John came towards her. She was totally
unprepared for such a meeting. She had fancied that her only sensation
upon encountering her husband again would be one of righteous
indignation; but as he came towards her now she was overcome by a sense
of guiltiness on her own account that placed her at a manifest
disadvantage. What if he were to carry the war into the enemy's
camp--if, instead of waiting to be upbraided, he were to begin by
upbraiding her. He was armed with undeniable authority; he had power,
if he chose, to call her to account for her desertion of him. In any
case, he might judge that it would have been her duty to hear what he,
as well as Mary, had to say before she ran away from him. She was
touched, in spite of herself, to note how his trouble had told upon him
physically. She could not have believed that he could have changed so
much within a week. There were traces of many a sleepless night, of
many a baffled quest, of many a heartsick longing written in his face.
He had turned pale as he saw her (and the effect was the more startling
that his hue was so rubicund under its normal aspect), but his eyes had
a sterner expression than she had ever seen in them before. In vain she
raised her head with a half-defiant gesture. Despite her certitude that
she had had the best of warrants for running away, she felt and looked
liked a culprit.</p>

<p>The unexpectedness of his attitude disconcerted her. John in his
letters and John in the flesh seemed to be no longer one and the same
person. Judging by his written appeal, which she had not answered, she
had expected to find him wellnigh crushed to the earth under the weight
of his remorseful misery. Meeting him face to face, he looked more like
a severe judge than a penitent evil-doer. "He thinks he has me quite in
his power now," Portia said to herself; but it was not a favourable
moment for proving the contrary. The bare-armed maid had retreated to
her hearthstoning, little dreaming that the lady and gentleman who had
stared at each other in the hall were husband and wife; but close
behind John a person was descending the stairs, whom Portia divined to
be the doctor. In addition to the sedately professional air that a
medical man puts on almost unconsciously with the coat in which he
makes his morning rounds, there was a solemnity in his demeanour that
spoke of a serious case. Portia had made a little movement forward as
John descended the last step of the stairs. Neither she nor her husband
had extended a welcoming hand to each other.</p>

<p>"I have come to see Mary," Portia said in strangled tones. Never
since her childhood had she been so conscious of the presence of an
aching lump in her throat. "She sent for me. Can I go to her now!"</p>

<p>"You had better speak to the doctor," replied John, briefly. His
wife did not see the yearning in his eyes as she turned away from
him.</p>

<p>She waylaid the doctor as he passed through the hall, and appealed
to him in trembling anxiety:</p>

<p>"Is Mary Willet--Mrs. Morris," she stammered--"is the person who had
the accident able to see me? Do please tell me. Is she very dangerously
hurt?"</p>

<p>"Are you a friend of hers?" the doctor asked gently.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Portia, firmly; "but I know she was not expected to
live yesterday. Is there any hope of saving her now?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid--none. The wonder is that she should be alive still.
You know how the accident happened, I suppose? No? She slipped in the
street yesterday with her child; a cart was going by at the moment. She
managed to save the child, but the wheel came into contact with her
neck, which was fatally injured. It is indeed wonderful that she has
not succumbed to it already. She is conscious and coherent still.
Everything that could be done has been done for her. I shall be back
again myself directly--but there is no possibility of saving her."</p>

<p>He bowed and left her. Portia turned helplessly round, intimating by
a gesture to her husband that she desired to be taken to Mary's room.
John preceded her up the staircase without a word, and passed uninvited
after her into the chamber of death, of which the door opening on to a
narrow landing was only partially closed. The blind was up, and as
Portia entered the room she became aware, like the Physician in
Andersen's tales, that Death was seated at the head of the bed. It was
the first time she had ever stood in his mighty presence, but her
feeling was more of awe than of fear.</p>

<p>Mary's throat was covered with bandages. But the haunting Madonna
eyes, set in a face of most ghastly pallor, looked up from the pillow
as Portia entered. The dark hair was tumbled and towsled. The left arm
was lying on the counterpane, and the hand, with the mark of dark
needle--pricks on the fore-finger, clutched tightly at the flannel gown
of the solemn-faced baby, sitting up baby-wise with wagging head, by
her side. The sight wrung Portia's heart. Mary's eyes, shining already
with the strange, flickering light of a lamp that is nearly spent, were
seeking hers, and she could read the supreme appeal that was written in
them. She walked softly to the bedside, and, with her husband's eyes
directed towards her every movement, stooped over the pillow of the
dying woman and kissed her tenderly on the forehead. There was
unspeakable longing in Mary's gaze. Her lips moved but no sound issued
from them. Portia was fain to bend low to catch the almost inaudible
words, of which the utterance was every moment arrested by a hoarse,
unnatural wheeze, like that of a child with the croup. But the movement
of the speaker's head in the direction of the child, and the feeble
attempt to draw it closer to her side, made clear much that was left
unsaid.</p>

<p>"My little one, Miss." The hoarse whisper seemed to drive through
Portia's brain and to penetrate to her very heart. "Please take
him--bring him up." There was a gasping intensity in the spasmodically
uttered words that rendered them doubly impressive. "His father--too--"
hoarse wheezing choked her utterance.</p>

<p>Portia knelt by the bedside and encircled the child with her arm.
"Mary--poor Mary," she said pitifully, and there were tears in her
voice, "he shall be safe with me--he shall indeed. I promise you--I
will keep him always, Mary dear--I will tell him about
you--and--and--is there nothing I can do for you now? I am afraid you
are in great pain." For at this moment a spasm of agony, the strain of
catching at her fast departing breath, was contracting the dying
woman's face. But Mary's message was not all spoken. The final mission
of the pictured Madonna had still to be accomplished upon earth. With
the dews of death gathering upon her forehead, she turned her gaze
towards her rival's husband, towards the man who had betrayed her,
standing silent at the foot of the bed, and petitioned him mutely to
come closer to her. As he approached the bedside, she reached out
feeble fingers for his hand, and placed it upon his child's head.
Before he could withdraw it, she had clutched at, Portia's hand, and
now essayed to unite it with John's in her dying clasp. At this moment
Portia's fate might be said to tremble in the balance. She struggled to
free herself, and had she obeyed the first strong impulse all her
life's history might have been changed. But John's hand had already
closed around hers, and as she raised her eyes in protest to his face
she saw something written there that forbade her to draw it away.
Thinking over the scene afterwards, she wondered how it was that she
had come to capitulate so promptly and so entirely. Was it because she
deemed that her husband had been punished enough? Was her heart melted
by the evidence of the mental suffering he had endured, by the traces
of hope-deferred heart-sickness, of wounded affection, of yearning
tenderness she could read in his eyes? Was it simply that she felt once
more as she had felt on her wedding morning--"Who shall shut out fate?"
and that she recognised the futility of struggling against her destiny?
Or did it occur to her that if she had thought (not only at the
eleventh hour, but when the eleventh hour was past that she might still
escape her fate by espousing Mary's cause, the pretext was unavailing
now, since it was Mary herself who had forced her to return, and Mary's
hand, already clammy with death, that was riveting her to her husband
with a force stronger than that of the grave? Was she impelled to act
as she did by her sense of the sacredness of the charge she had
undertaken? Did Mary's child forge the chain that must bind her
henceforth to John? Was it that her short insight into Anna's life had
been a disillusion, and that she was afraid of launching, as Anna had
done, upon a rudderless existence? Did the recollection of Harry's
advice to her to return, given with the full knowledge that he ran the
risk of losing her for ever, influence her decision? Was she moved by
the sudden impulse to immolate herself that has converted so many women
into nuns and nursing sisters? Was she tired out by her night journey
and her emotion, and unable to form a resolution? Was it apathy, was it
pique, was it pity, was it rewakening love, or was it a mixture of all
these together that swayed her! Whatever might have been the motive
(and even to herself it was never clear), the fact remained that she
allowed her hand to lie in John's grasp. Mary's agony was mercifully
short, but before her eyes rolled upwards in death they were irradiated
by a light that spoke more eloquently than any words of a soul that
departed in peace. Her work was done, her mission accomplished. Her
child would be the gainer by her death, and for herself the sleep that
knows no awakening was a boon.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Mr. and Mrs. Morrisson walked back to breakfast
at Kensington arm in arm. Wilmer and Emma welcomed them as naturally as
though they had just returned from the conventional honeymoon trip they
had contemplated. Three months afterwards, upon an afternoon of
November fog that had no crimson sunbeams captive this time, the whole
party stood upon the hurricane deck of a huge Orient liner in the docks
upon the eve of a separation. The bride and bridegroom were leaving for
Australia. A stout lady, easily recognisable as Mrs. James, wearing a
huge mantle entirely composed of the minute and costly furs of the
Australian duck-billed platypus, was holding two embroidered
handkerchiefs in readiness--one for wetting, the other for waiving. The
young married lady of the party, clad in a becoming sea-going suit of
tweed, was dividing her attentions between the stout lady with the
handkerchiefs, and a solemn--looking infant seated upon its nurse's
arm.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it's too cold for him on deck, Emma?" she said
anxiously. "I'll just show Eliza the cabin next to ours that we've
taken for him. I'll be back again directly."</p>

<p>She hurried below, followed by the maid with the child, but after
installing them in the cabin in question was stopped on her way through
the splendid dining-saloon by a gentleman crossing it from the opposite
end. The fast-gathering fog, of a dingy brown-ochre hue, prevented her
from seeing him until he was quite close to her. Then she recognised
Harry Tolhurst.</p>

<p>"I thought I might be allowed just to come and wish you god-speed,"
he said, holding out his hand. He had not seen her since the day when
he had urged her at all costs to return to London. "I know what you
have done, and I trust you have your reward. If I could only hear you
say--before I wish you good-bye for ever--that you have found it
already!" Tears started into Portia's eyes. She tried her utmost not to
let them fall. "Do you remember what you said," she whispered, "about
climbing the steep and thorny path to Heaven? But then, you are sure at
least that it does lead to Heaven--But see?" Her voice changed, and its
tone became placid and conventional. "Here is my husband. Let me
introduce you to Mr. Tolhurst, John." There was little time for
conversation. Harry felt that it would not be fitting for him to
intrude upon the farewell effusions of the bride and her relatives. His
last vision of Portia was standing by her husband's side close to the
bulwarks, bravely trying to smile, as the vessel moved from the docks.
The fog was not so thick but that he could see the moisture shining in
her eyes at the same instant. It was in just such an atmosphere that
she had passed out of his sight a few months ago, after their joyous
meeting at the Academy. But the fog had been rose-stained then, and
there had been hope in his heart. It was mud-coloured to-day, and the
hope was crushed and dead. If he could have put on the Town
Councillor's magic shoes that Hans Andersen writes about, if he could
have gone back to the day when he had sat with Portia under the shadow
of the stone queen in the Luxembourg Gardens, would he have given her
the same advice as he had given her then? Would he have upheld the
selfsame standard, and essayed, as he had also done, to act up to it
himself? He tried to think that he had answered both these questions in
the affirmative as he went back to his self-imposed career of work and
solitude.</p>
