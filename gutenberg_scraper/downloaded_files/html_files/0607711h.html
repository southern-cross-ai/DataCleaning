<h1>The Crown Derby Plate</h1>

<h3>by</h3>

<h2>Marjorie Bowen</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>Martha Pym said that she had never seen a ghost and that she would
very much like to do so, "particularly at Christmas, for you can
laugh as you like, that is the correct time to see a ghost."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you ever will," replied her cousin Mabel
comfortably, while her cousin Clara shuddered and said that she hoped
they would change the subject for she disliked even to think of such
things.</p>

<p>The three elderly, cheerful women sat round a big fire, cosy and
content after a day of pleasant activities; Martha was the guest of
the other two, who owned the handsome, convenient country house; she
always came to spend her Christmas with the Wyntons and found the
leisurely country life delightful after the bustling round of London,
for Martha managed an antique shop of the better sort and worked
extremely hard. She was, however, still full of zest for work or
pleasure, though sixty years old, and looked backwards and forwards
to a succession of delightful days.</p>

<p>The other two, Mabel and Clara, led quieter but none the less
agreeable lives; they had more money and fewer interests, but
nevertheless enjoyed themselves very well.</p>

<p>"Talking of ghosts," said Mabel, "I wonder how that old woman at
'Hartleys' is getting on, for 'Hartleys,' you know, is supposed to be
haunted."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," smiled Miss Pym, "but all the years that we have
known of the place we have never heard anything definite, have
we?"</p>

<p>"No," put in Clara; "but there <i>is</i> that persistent rumour
that the House is uncanny, and for myself, <i>nothing</i> would
induce me to live there!"</p>

<p>"It is certainly very lonely and dreary down there on the
marshes," conceded Mabel. "But as for the ghost&mdash;you never hear
<i>what</i> it is supposed to be even."</p>

<p>"Who has taken it?" asked Miss Pym, remembering "Hartleys" as very
desolate indeed, and long shut up.</p>

<p>"A Miss Lefain, an eccentric old creature&mdash;I think you met
her here once, two years ago&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I believe that I did, but I don't recall her at all."</p>

<p>"We have not seen her since, 'Hartleys' is so un-get-at-able and
she didn't seem to want visitors. She collects china, Martha, so
really you ought to go and see her and talk 'shop.'"</p>

<p>With the word "china" some curious associations came into the mind
of Martha Pym; she was silent while she strove to put them together,
and after a second or two they all fitted together into a very clear
picture.</p>

<p>She remembered that thirty years ago&mdash;yes, it must be thirty
years ago, when, as a young woman, she had put all her capital into
the antique business, and had been staying with her cousins (her aunt
had then been alive) that she had driven across the marsh to
"Hartleys," where there was an auction sale; all the details of this
she had completely forgotten, but she could recall quite clearly
purchasing a set of gorgeous china which was still one of her proud
delights, a perfect set of Crown Derby save that one plate was
missing.</p>

<p>"How odd," she remarked, "that this Miss Lefain should collect
china too, for it was at 'Hartleys' that I purchased my dear old
Derby service&mdash;I've never been able to match that
plate&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A plate was missing? I seem to remember," said Clara. "Didn't
they say that it must be in the house somewhere and that it should be
looked for?"</p>

<p>"I believe they did, but of course I never heard any more and that
missing plate has annoyed me ever since. Who had 'Hartleys'?"</p>

<p>"An old connoisseur, Sir James Sewell; I believe he was some
relation to this Miss Lefain, but I don't know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wonder if she has found the plate," mused Miss Pym. "I expect
she has turned out and ransacked the whole place&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why not trot over and ask?" suggested Mabel. "It's not much use
to her, if she has found it, one odd plate."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," said Clara. "Fancy going over the marshes, this
weather, to ask about a plate missed all those years ago. I'm sure
Martha wouldn't think of it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Martha did think of it; she was rather fascinated by the idea;
how queer and pleasant it would be if, after all these years, nearly
a lifetime, she should find the Crown Derby plate, the loss of which
had always irked her! And this hope did not seem so altogether
fantastical, it was quite likely that old Miss Lefain, poking about
in the ancient house, had found the missing piece.</p>

<p>And, of course, if she had, being a fellow-collector, she would be
quite willing to part with it to complete the set.</p>

<p>Her cousin endeavoured to dissuade her; Miss Lefain, she declared,
was a recluse, an odd creature who might greatly resent such a visit
and such a request.</p>

<p>"Well, if she does I can but come away again," smiled Miss Pym. "I
suppose she can't bite my head off, and I rather like meeting these
curious types&mdash;we've got a love for old china in common,
anyhow."</p>

<p>"It seems so silly to think of it&mdash;after all these
years&mdash;a plate!"</p>

<p>"A Crown Derby plate," corrected Miss Pym. "It is certainly
strange that I didn't think of it before, but now that I have got it
into my head I can't get it out. Besides," she added hopefully, "I
might see the ghost."</p>

<p>So full, however, were the days with pleasant local engagements
that Miss Pym had no immediate chance of putting her scheme into
practice; but she did not relinquish it, and she asked several
different people what they knew about "Hartleys" and Miss Lefain.</p>

<p>And no one knew anything save that the house was supposed to be
haunted and the owner "cracky."</p>

<p>"Is there a story?" asked Miss Pym, who associated ghosts with
neat tales into which they fitted as exactly as nuts into shells.</p>

<p>But she was always told: "Oh, no, there isn't a story, no one
knows anything about the place, don't know how the idea got about;
old Sewcll was half-crazy, I believe, he was buried in the garden and
that gives a house a nasty name&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very unpleasant," said Martha Pym, undisturbed.</p>

<p>This ghost seemed too elusive for her to track down; she would
have to be content if she could recover the Crown Derby plate; for
that at least she was determined to make a try and also to satisfy
that faint tingling of curiosity roused in her by this talk about
"Hartleys" and the remembrance of that day, so long ago, when she had
gone to the auction sale at the lonely old house.</p>

<p>So the first free afternoon, while Mabel and Clara were
comfortably taking their afternoon repose, Martha Pym, who was of a
more lively habit, got out her little governess cart and dashed away
across the Essex flats.</p>

<p>She had taken minute directions with her, but she had soon lost
her way.</p>

<p>Under the wintry sky, which looked as grey and hard as metal, the
marshes stretched bleakly to the horizon, the olive-brown broken
reeds were harsh as scars on the saffron-tinted bogs, where the
sluggish waters that rose so high in winter were filmed over with the
first stillness of a frost; the air was cold but not keen, everything
was damp; faintest of mists blurred the black outlines of trees that
rose stark from the ridges above the stagnant dykes; the flooded
fields were haunted by black birds and white birds, gulls and crows,
whining above the long ditch grass and wintry wastes.</p>

<p>Miss Pym stopped the little horse and surveyed this spectral
scene, which had a certain relish about it to one sure to return to a
homely village, a cheerful house and good company.</p>

<p>A withered and bleached old man, in colour like the dun landscape,
came along the road between the sparse alders.</p>

<p>Miss Pym, buttoning up her coat, asked the way to "Hartley" as he
passed her; he told her, straight on, and she proceeded, straight
indeed across the road that went with undeviating length across the
marshes.</p>

<p>"Of course," thought Miss Pym, "if you live in a place like this,
you are bound to invent ghosts."</p>

<p>The house sprang up suddenly on a knoll ringed with rotting trees,
encompassed by an old brick wall that the perpetual damp had overrun
with lichen, blue, green, white colours of decay.</p>

<p>"Hartleys," no doubt, there was no other residence of human being
in sight in all the wide expanse; besides, she could remember it,
surely, after all this time, the sharp rising out of the marsh, the
colony of tall trees, but then fields and trees had been green and
bright&mdash;there had been no water on the flats, it had been
summer-time.</p>

<p>"She certainly," thought Miss Pym, "must be crazy to live here.
And I rather doubt if I shall get my plate."</p>

<p>She fastened up the good little horse by the garden gate which
stood negligently ajar and entered; the garden itself was so
neglected that it was quite surprising to see a trim appearance in
the house, curtains at the window and a polish on the brass door
knocker, which must have been recently rubbed there, considering the
taint in the sea damp which rusted and rotted everything.</p>

<p>It was a square-built, substantial house with "nothing wrong with
it but the situation," Miss Pym decided, though it was not very
attractive, being built of that drab plastered stone so popular a
hundred years ago, with flat windows and door, while one side was
gloomily shaded by a large evergreen tree of the cypress variety
which gave a blackish tinge to that portion of the garden.</p>

<p>There was no pretence at flower-beds nor any manner of cultivation
in this garden where a few rank weeds and straggling bushes matted
together above the dead grass; on the enclosing wall which appeared
to have been built high as protection against the ceaseless winds
that swung along the flats were the remains of fruit trees; their
crucified branches, rotting under the great nails that held them up,
looked like the skeletons of those who had died in torment.</p>

<p>Miss Pym took in these noxious details as she knocked firmly at
the door; they did not depress her; she merely felt extremely sorry
for anyone who could live in such a place.</p>

<p>She noticed, at the far end of the garden, in the corner of the
wall, a headstone showing above the sodden colourless grass, and
remembered what she had been told about the old antiquary being
buried there, in the grounds of "Hartleys."</p>

<p>As the knock had no effect she stepped back and looked at the
house; it was certainly inhabited&mdash;with those neat windows,
white curtains and drab blinds all pulled to precisely the same
level.</p>

<p>And when she brought her glance back to the door she saw that it
had been opened and that someone, considerably obscured by the
darkness of the passage, was looking at her intently.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon," said Miss Pym cheerfully. "I just thought that I
would call to see Miss Lefain&mdash;it is Miss Lefain, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It's my house," was the querulous reply.</p>

<p>Martha Pym had hardly expected to find any servants here, though
the old lady must, she thought, work pretty hard to keep the house so
clean and tidy as it appeared to be.</p>

<p>"Of course," she replied. "May I come in? I'm Martha Pym, staying
with the Wyntons, I met you there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do come in," was the faint reply. "I get so few people to visit
me, I'm really very lonely."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder," thought Miss Pym; but she had resolved to take
no notice of any eccentricity on the part of her hostess, and so she
entered the house with her usual agreeable candour and courtesy.</p>

<p>The passage was badly lit, but she was able to get a fair idea of
Miss Lefain; her first impression was that this poor creature was
most dreadfully old, older than any human being had the right to be,
why, she felt young in comparison&mdash;so faded, feeble, and pallid
was Miss Lefain.</p>

<p>She was also monstrously fat; her gross, flaccid figure was
shapeless and she wore a badly cut, full dress of no colour at all,
but stained with earth and damp where Miss Pym supposed she had been
doing futile gardening; this gown was doubtless designed to disguise
her stoutness, but had been so carelessly pulled about that it only
added to it, being rucked and rolled "all over the place" as Miss Pym
put it to herself.</p>

<p>Another ridiculous touch about the appearance of the poor old lady
was her short hair; decrepit as she was, and lonely as she lived she
had actually had her scanty relics of white hair cropped round her
shaking head.</p>

<p>"Dear me, dear me," she said in her thin treble voice. "How very
kind of you to come. I suppose you prefer the parlour? I generally
sit in the garden."</p>

<p>"The garden? But not in this weather?"</p>

<p>"I get used to the weather. You've no idea how used one gets to
the weather."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," conceded Miss Pym doubtfully. "You don't live here
quite alone, do you?"</p>

<p>"Quite alone, lately. I had a little company, but she was taken
away, I'm sure I don't know where. I haven't been able to find a
trace of her anywhere," replied the old lady peevishly.</p>

<p>"Some wretched companion that couldn't stick it, I suppose,"
thought Miss Pym. "Well, I don't wonder&mdash;but someone ought to be
here to look after her."</p>

<p>They went into the parlour, which, the visitor was dismayed to
see, was without a fire but otherwise well kept.</p>

<p>And there, on dozens of shelves was a choice array of china at
which Martha Pym's eyes glistened.</p>

<p>"Aha!" cried Miss Lefain. "I see you've noticed my treasures!
Don't you envy me? Don't you wish that you had some of those
pieces?"</p>

<p>Martha Pym certainly did and she looked eagerly and greedily round
the walls, tables, and cabinets while the old woman followed her with
little thin squeals of pleasure.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful little collection, most choicely and elegantly
arranged, and Martha thought it marvellous that this feeble ancient
creature should be able to keep it in such precise order as well as
doing her own housework.</p>

<p>"Do you really do everything yourself here and live quite alone?"
she asked, and she shivered even in her thick coat and wished that
Miss Lefain's energy had risen to a fire, but then probably she lived
in the kitchen, as these lonely eccentrics often did.</p>

<p>"There was someone," answered Miss Lefain cunningly, "but I had to
send her away. I told you she's gone, I can't find her, and I am so
glad. Of course," she added wistfully, "it leaves me very lonely, but
then I couldn't stand her impertinence any longer. She used to say
that it was <i>her</i> house and her collection of china! Would you
believe it? She used to try to chase me away from looking at my own
things!"</p>

<p>"How very disagreeable," said Miss Pym, wondering which of the two
women had been crazy. "But hadn't you better get someone else."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," was the jealous answer. "I would rather be alone with my
things, I daren't leave the house for fear someone takes them
away&mdash;there was a dreadful time once when an auction sale was
held here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Were you here then?" asked Miss Pym; but indeed she looked old
enough to have been anywhere.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," Miss Lefain replied rather peevishly and Miss
Pym decided that she must be a relation of old Sir James Sewell.
Clara and Mabel had been very foggy about it all. "I was very busy
hiding all the china&mdash;but one set they got&mdash;a Crown Derby
tea service&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With one plate missing!" cried Martha Pym. "I bought it, and do
you know, I was wondering if you'd found it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I hid it," piped Miss Lefain.</p>

<p>"Oh, you did, did you? Well, that's rather funny behaviour. Why
did you hide the stuff away instead of buying it?"</p>

<p>"How could I buy what was mine?"</p>

<p>"Old Sir James left it to you, then?" asked Martha Pym, feeling
very muddled.</p>

<p>"<i>She</i> bought a lot more," squeaked Miss Lefain, but Martha
Pym tried to keep her to the point.</p>

<p>"If you've got the plate," she insisted, "you might let me have
it&mdash;I'll pay quite handsomely, it would be so pleasant to have
it after all these years."</p>

<p>"Money is no use to me," said Miss Lefain mournfully. "Not a bit
of use. I can't leave the house or the garden."</p>

<p>"Well, you have to live, I suppose," replied Martha Pym
cheerfully. "And, do you know, I'm afraid you are getting rather
morbid and dull, living here all alone&mdash;you really ought to have
a fire&mdash;why, it's just on Christmas and very damp."</p>

<p>"I haven't felt the cold for a long time," replied the other; she
seated herself with a sigh on one of the horsehair chairs and Miss
Pym noticed with a start that her feet were covered only by a pair of
white stockings; "one of those nasty health fiends," thought Miss
Pym, "but she doesn't look too well for all that."</p>

<p>"So you don't think that you could let me have the plate?" she
asked briskly, walking up and down, for the dark, neat, clean parlour
was very cold indeed, and she thought that she couldn't stand this
much longer; as there seemed no sign of tea or anything pleasant and
comfortable she had really better go.</p>

<p>"I might let you have it," sighed Miss Lefain, "since you've been
so kind as to pay me a visit. After all, one plate isn't much use, is
it?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, I wonder you troubled to hide
it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I couldn't <i>bear</i>," wailed the other, "to see the things
going out of the house!"</p>

<p>Martha Pym couldn't stop to go into all this; it was quite clear
that the old lady was very eccentric indeed and that nothing very
much could be done with her; no wonder that she had "dropped out" of
everything and that no one ever saw her or knew anything about her,
though Miss Pym felt that some effort ought really to be made to save
her from herself.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like a run in my little governess cart?" she
suggested. "We might go to tea with the Wyntons on the way back,
they'd be delighted to see you, and I really think that you do want
taking out of yourself."</p>

<p>"I was taken out of myself some time ago," replied Miss Lefain. "I
really was, and I couldn't leave my things&mdash;though," she added
with pathetic gratitude, "it is very, very kind of
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your things would be quite safe, I'm sure," said Martha Pym,
humouring her. "Who ever would come up here, this hour of a winter's
day?"</p>

<p>"They do, oh, they do! And <i>she</i> might come back, prying and
nosing and saying that it was all hers, all my beautiful china,
hers!"</p>

<p>Miss Lefain squealed in her agitation and rising up, ran round the
wall fingering with flaccid yellow hands the brilliant glossy pieces
on the shelves.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'm afraid that I must go, they'll be expecting me,
and it's quite a long ride; perhaps some other time you'll come and
see us?</p>

<p>"Oh, must you go?" quavered Miss Lefain dolefully. "I do like a
little company now and then and I trusted you from the
first&mdash;the others, when they do come, are always after my things
and I have to frighten them away!"</p>

<p>"Frighten them away!" replied Martha Pym. "However do you do
that?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem difficult, people are so easily frightened,
aren't they?"</p>

<p>Miss Pym suddenly remembered that "Hartleys" had the reputation of
being haunted&mdash;perhaps the queer old thing played on that; the
lonely house with the grave in the garden was dreary enough around
which to create a legend.</p>

<p>"I suppose you've never seen a ghost?" she asked pleasantly. "I'd
rather like to see one, you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no one here but myself," said Miss Lefain.</p>

<p>"So you've never seen anything? I thought it must be all nonsense.
Still, I do think it rather melancholy for you to live here all
alone&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Lefain sighed:</p>

<p>"Yes, it's very lonely. Do stay and talk to me a little longer."
Her whistling voice dropped cunningly. "And I'll give you the Crown
Derby plate!"</p>

<p>"Are you sure you've really got it?" Miss Pym asked.</p>

<p>"I'll show you."</p>

<p>Fat and waddling as she was, she seemed to move very lightly as
she slipped in front of Miss Pym and conducted her from the room,
going slowly up the stairs&mdash;such a gross odd figure in that
clumsy dress with the fringe of white hair hanging on to her
shoulders.</p>

<p>The upstairs of the house was as neat as the parlour, everything
well in its place; but there was no sign of occupancy; the beds were
covered with dust sheets, there were no lamps or fires set ready. "I
suppose," said Miss Pym to herself, "she doesn't care to show me
where she reeally lives."</p>

<p>But as they passed from one room to another, she could not help
saying:</p>

<p>"Where <i>do</i> you live, Miss Lefain?"</p>

<p>"Mostly in the garden," said the other.</p>

<p>Miss Pym thought of those horrible health huts that some people
indulged in.</p>

<p>"Well, sooner you than I," she replied cheerfully.</p>

<p>In the most distant room of all, a dark, tiny closet, Miss Lefain
opened a deep cupboard and brought out a Crown Derby plate which her
guest received with a spasm of joy, for it was actually that missing
from her cherished set.</p>

<p>"It's very good of you," she said in delight. "Won't you take
something for it, or let me do something for you?"</p>

<p>"You might come and see me again," replied Miss Lefain
wistfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course I should like to come and see you again."</p>

<p>But now that she had got what she had really come for, the plate,
Martha Pym wanted to be gone; it was really very dismal and
depressing in the house and she began to notice a fearful
smell&mdash;the place had been shut up too long, there was something
damp rotting somewhere, in this horrid little dark closet no
doubt.</p>

<p>"I really must be going," she said hurriedly.</p>

<p>Miss Lefain turned as if to cling to her, but Martha Pym moved
quickly away.</p>

<p>"Dear me," wailed the old lady. "Why are you in such haste?"</p>

<p>"There's&mdash;a smell," murmured Miss Pym rather faintly.</p>

<p>She found herself hastening down the stairs, with Miss Lefain
complaining behind her.</p>

<p>"How peculiar people are&mdash;<i>she</i> used to talk of a
smell&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you must notice it yourself."</p>

<p>Miss Pym was in the hall; the old woman had not followed her, but
stood in the semi-darkness at the head of the stairs, a pale
shapeless figure.</p>

<p>Martha Pym hated to be rude and ungrateful but she could not stay
another moment; she hurried away and was in her cart in a
moment&mdash;really&mdash;that smell&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" she called out with false cheerfulness, "and thank you
<i>so</i> much!"</p>

<p>There was no answer from the house.</p>

<p>Miss Pym drove on; she was rather upset and took another way than
that by which she had come, a way that led past a little house raised
above the marsh; she was glad to think that the poor old creature at
"Hartleys" had such near neighbours, and she reined up the horse,
dubious as to whether she should call someone and tell them that poor
old Miss Lefain really wanted a little looking after, alone in a
house like that, and plainly not quite right in her head.</p>

<p>A young woman, attracted by the sound of the governess cart, came
to the door of the house and seeing Miss Pym called out, asking if
she wanted the keys of the house?</p>

<p>"What house?" asked Miss Pym.</p>

<p>"'Hartleys,' mum, they don't put a board out, as no one is likely
to pass, but it's to be sold. Miss Lefain wants to sell or let
it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've just been up to see her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, mum&mdash;she's been away a year, abroad somewhere,
couldn't stand the place, it's been empty since then, I just run in
every day and keep things tidy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Loquacious and curious the young woman had come to the fence; Miss
Pym had stopped her horse.</p>

<p>"Miss Lefain is there now," she said. "She must have just come
back&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She wasn't there this morning, mum, 'tisn't likely she'd come,
either&mdash;fair scared she was, mum, fair chased away, didn't dare
move her china. Can't say I've noticed anything myself, but I never
stay long&mdash;and there's a smell&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Martha Pym faintly, "there's a smell.
What&mdash;what&mdash;chased her away?"</p>

<p>The young woman, even in that lonely place, lowered her voice.</p>

<p>"Well, as you aren't thinking of taking the place, she got an idea
in her head that old Sir James&mdash;well, he couldn't bear to leave
'Hartleys,' mum, he's buried in the garden, and she thought he was
after her, chasing round them bits of china&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Miss Pym.</p>

<p>"Some of it used to be his, she found a lot stuffed away, he said
they were to be left in 'Hartleys,' but Miss Lefain would have the
things sold, I believe&mdash;that's years ago&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Miss Pym with a sick look. "You don't know what
he was like, do you?"</p>

<p>"No, mum&mdash;but I've heard tell he was very stout and very
old&mdash;I wonder who it was you saw up at 'Hartleys'?"</p>

<p>Miss Pym took a Crown Derby plate from her bag.</p>

<p>"You might take that back when you go," she whispered. "I shan't
want it, after all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Before the astonished young woman could answer Miss Pym had darted
off across the marsh; that short hair, that earth-stained robe, the
white socks, "I generally live in the garden&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Pym drove away, breakneck speed, frantically resolving to
mention to no one that she had paid a visit to "Hartleys," nor
lightly again to bring up the subject of ghosts.</p>

<p>She shook and shuddered in the damp, trying to get out of her
clothes and her nostrils&mdash;that indescribable smell.</p>
