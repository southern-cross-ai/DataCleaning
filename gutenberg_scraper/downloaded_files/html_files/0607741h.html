<p>And wherefore have they come, this warlike band,<br>
  That o&rsquo;er the ocean many a weary day<br>
  Have tossed; and now beside Suakim&rsquo;s Bay,<br>
  With faces stern and resolute, do stand,<br>
  Waking the desert&rsquo;s echoes with the drum&mdash;<br>
  Men of Australia, wherefore have ye come?</p>
<p>To keep the Puppet Khedive on the throne,<br>
  To strike a blow for tyranny and wrong,<br>
  To crush the weak and aid the oppressing strong!<br>
  Regardless of the hapless Fellah&rsquo;s moan,<br>
  To force the payment of the Hebrew loan,<br>
  Squeezing the tax like blood from out the stone?</p>
<p>And fair Australia,  freest of the free,<br>
  Is up in arms against the freeman&rsquo;s fight;<br>
  And with her mother joined to crush the right&mdash;<br>
  Has left her threatened treasures o&rsquo;er the sea,<br>
  Has left her land of liberty and law<br>
  To flesh her maiden sword in this unholy war.</p>
<p>Enough! God never blessed such enterprise&mdash;<br>
  England&rsquo;s  degenerate Generals yet shall rue<br>
  Brave Gordon sacrificed, when soon they view<br>
  The children of a thousand deserts rise<br>
  To drive them forth like sand before the gale&mdash;<br>
  God and the Prophet! Freedom will prevail.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBushfire"></a>The Bushfire</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note"><i>An Allegory</i></p>
<p><br>
  &rsquo;Twas on the famous Empire run,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose sun does never set,<br>
  Whose grass and water, so they say,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have never failed them yet&mdash;<br>
  They carry many million sheep,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through seasons dry and wet.</p>
<p>They call the homestead Albion House,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, along with that,<br>
  There&rsquo;s Welshman&rsquo;s Gully, Scotchman&rsquo;s Hill,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Paddymelon Flat:<br>
  And all these places are renowned<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For making jumbucks fat.</p>
<p>And the out-paddocks&mdash;holy frost!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There wouldn&rsquo;t be no sense<br>
  For me to try and tell you half<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They really are immense;<br>
  A man might ride for days and weeks<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never strike a fence.</p>
<p>But still for years they never had<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Been known a sheep to lose;<br>
  Old Billy Gladstone managed it,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you can bet your shoes<br>
  He&rsquo;d scores of supers under him,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And droves of jackaroos.</p>
<p>Old Billy had an eagle eye,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kept his wits about&mdash;<br>
  If any chaps got trespassing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly cleared &lsquo;em out;<br>
  And coves that used to &ldquo;work a cross&rdquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hated him, no doubt.</p>
<p>But still he managed it in style,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the times got dry,<br>
  And Billy gave the supers word<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see and mind their eye&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;If any paddocks gets a-fire<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll know the reason why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now on this point old Bill was sure,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, for many a year,<br>
  Whenever times got dry at all,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sure as you are here,<br>
  The Paddymelon Flat got burnt,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Bill thought rather queer.</p>
<p>He sent his smartest supers there<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To try and keep things right.<br>
  No use! The grass was always dry&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;d go to sleep at night,<br>
  And when they woke they&rsquo;d go and find<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole concern alight.</p>
<p>One morning it was very hot&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun rose in a haze;<br>
  Old Bill was cutting down some trees<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(One of his little ways);<br>
  A black boy came hot-foot to say<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Flat was in a blaze.</p>
<p>Old Bill he swears a fearful oath<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lets the tommy fall<br>
  Says he: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take this business up,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fix it once for all;<br>
  If this goes on the cursed run<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will send us to the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he withdrew his trespass suits,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;d one with Dutchy&rsquo;s boss&mdash;<br>
  In prosecutions criminal<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He entered nolle pros.,<br>
  But these were neither here nor there&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They always meant a loss.</p>
<p>And off to Paddymelon Flat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He started double-quick<br>
  Drayloads of men with lots of grog<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest heat should make them sick,<br>
  And all the strangers came around<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see him do the trick.</p>
<p>And there the fire was flaming bright,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For miles and miles it spread,<br>
  And many a sheep and horse and cow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were numbered with the dead&mdash;<br>
  The super came to meet Old Bill,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is what he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use, to try to beat it out,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twill dry you up like toast,<br>
  I&rsquo;ve done as much as man can do,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I never boast;<br>
  I think you&rsquo;d better chuck it up,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let the jumbucks roast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Bill said just two words:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rdquo;You&rsquo;re sacked,&rdquo;<br>
  And pitches off his coat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pitches off his coat,<br>
  And wrenches down a blue gum bough<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clears his manly throat,</p>
<p>And into it like threshing wheat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right sturdily he smote.<br>
  And beat the blazing grass until<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His shirt was dripping wet;<br>
  And all the people watched him there<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see what luck he&rsquo;d get,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! don&rsquo;t he make the cinders fly,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, &ldquo;Golly, don&rsquo;t he sweat!&rdquo;<br>
  But though they worked like Trojans all,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire still went ahead<br>
  So far as you could see around,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very skies were red,</p>
<p>Sometimes the flames would start afresh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just where they thought it dead.<br>
  His men, too, quarrelled &rsquo;mongst themselves<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some coves gave it best<br>
  And some said, &ldquo;Light a fire in front,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And burn from east to west&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Bill, he still kept sloggin&rsquo; in,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never took no rest.<br>
  Then, through the crowd a cornstalk kid<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come ridin&rsquo; to the spot<br>
  Says he to Bill, &ldquo;Now take a spell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re lookin&rsquo; very &rsquo;ot,</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ll only listen, why,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll tell you what is what.<br>
  &ldquo;These coves as set your grass on fire,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There ain&rsquo;t no mortal doubt,<br>
  I&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;em ridin&rsquo; here and there,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pokin&rsquo; round about;</p>
<p>It ain&rsquo;t no use your workin&rsquo; here,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until you finds them out.<br>
  &ldquo;See yonder, where you beat the fire&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s blazin&rsquo; up again,<br>
  And fires are starting right and left<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tipperary  plain,</p>
<p>Beating them out is useless quite,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless Heaven sends the rain.&rdquo;<br>
  Then Bill, he turns upon the boy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rdquo;Oh, hold your tongue, you pup!&rdquo;<br>
  But a cinder blew across the creek<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Bill stopped for a sup,<br>
  And fired the Albion paddocks, too&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a bitter cup;<br>
  Old Bill&rsquo;s great heart was broke at last,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had to chuck it up.</p>
<p>Moral</p>
<p>The run is England&rsquo;s  Empire great,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire is the distress<br>
  That burns the stock they represent&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prosperity you&rsquo;ll guess.<br>
  And the blue gum bough is the Home Rule Bill<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s making such a mess.</p>
<p>And Ireland  green, of course I mean<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Paddymelon Flat;<br>
  All men can see the fire, of course,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spreads on at such a bat,<br>
  But who are setting it alight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot tell you that.</p>
<p>But this I think all men will see,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hold it very true<br>
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t quarrel with effects until<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cause is brought to view.&rdquo;<br>
  What is the cause? That cornstalk boy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seemed to think he knew.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheDeficitDemon"></a>The  Deficit Demon</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note"><i>A Political Ballad</i></p>
<p><br>
  It was the lunatic poet escaped from the local asylum,<br>
  Loudly he twanged on his banjo and sang with his voice like a saw-mill,<br>
  While as with fervour he sang there was borne o&rsquo;er the shuddering wildwood,<br>
  Borne on the breath of the poet a flavour of rum and of onions.</p>
<p>He sang of the Deficit Demon that dwelt in the Treasury Mountains,<br>
  How it was small in its youth and a champion was sent to destroy it:<br>
  Dibbs he was called, and he boasted, &ldquo;Soon will I wipe out the Monster,&rdquo;<br>
  But while he was boasting and bragging the monster grew larger and larger.</p>
<p>One day as Dibbs bragged of his prowess in daylight the Deficit  met him,<br>
  Settled his hash in one act and made him to all men a byword,<br>
  Sent him, a raving ex-Premier, to dwell in the shades of oblivion,<br>
  And the people put forward a champion known as Sir Patrick the Portly.</p>
<p>As in the midnight the tom-cat who seeketh his love on the house  top,<br>
  Lifteth his voice up in song and is struck by the fast whizzing brickbat,<br>
  Drops to the ground in a swoon and glides to the silent hereafter,<br>
  So fell Sir Patrick the Portly at the stroke of the Deficit Demon.</p>
<p>Then were the people amazed and they called for the champion of  champions<br>
  Known as Sir &rsquo;Enry the Fishfag unequalled in vilification.<br>
  He is the man, said the people, to wipe out the Deficit Monster,<br>
  If nothing else fetches him through he can at the least talk its head off.</p>
<p>So he sharpened his lance of Freetrade and he practised in  loud-mouthed abusing,<br>
  &ldquo;Poodlehead,&rdquo; &ldquo;Craven,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mole-eyes&rdquo; were things that he purposed to call  it,<br>
  He went to the fight full of valour and all men are waiting the issue,<br>
  Though they know not his armour nor weapons excepting his power of abusing.</p>
<p>Loud sang the lunatic poet his song of the champions of valour<br>
  Until he was sighted and captured by fleet-footed keepers pursuing,<br>
  To whom he remarked with a smile as they ran him off back to the madhouse,<br>
  &ldquo;If you want to back Parkes I&rsquo;m your man&mdash;here&rsquo;s a cool three to one on the  Deficit.&rdquo;</p>

    <b><a name="OurMat"></a>Our Mat</b></h2>
<p>It came from the prison this morning,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close-twisted, neat-lettered, and flat;<br>
  It lies the hall doorway adorning,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very good style of a mat.</p>
<p>Prison-made! how the spirit is moven<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we think of its story of dread<br>
  What wiles of the wicked are woven<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spun in its intricate thread!</p>
<p>The letters are new, neat and nobby,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suggesting a masterly hand<br>
  Was it Sikes, who half-murdered the bobby,<br>
  That put the neat D on the &ldquo;and&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Some banker found guilty of laches&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s always called laches, you know&mdash;<br>
  Had Holt any hand in those Hs?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did Bertrand illumine that O?</p>
<p>That T has a look of the gallows,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That A&rsquo;s a triangle, I guess;<br>
  Was it one of the Mount   Rennie fellows<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who twisted the strands of the S?</p>
<p>Was it made by some &ldquo;highly connected&rdquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is doing his spell &ldquo;on his head&rdquo;,<br>
  Or some wretched woman detected<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In stealing her children some bread?</p>
<p>Does it speak of a bitter repentance<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the crime that so easily came?<br>
  Of the wearisome length of the sentence,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sin, and the sorrow, and shame?</p>
<p>A mat! I should call it a sermon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On sin, to all sinners addressed;<br>
  It would take a keen judge to determine<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether writer or reader is best.</p>
<p>Though the doorway be hard as a pavestone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rather would use it than that&mdash;<br>
  I&rsquo;d as soon wipe my boots on a gravestone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I would on that Darlinghurst mat!</p>

<p align="center" class="note"><i>The Larrikin&rsquo;s Lament</i></p>
<p>My Uncle Bill! My Uncle Bill!<br>
  How doth my heart with anguish thrill!<br>
  For he, our chief, our Robin Hood,<br>
  Has gone to jail for stealing wood!<br>
  With tears and sobs my voice I raise<br>
  To celebrate my uncle&rsquo;s praise;<br>
  With all my strength, with all my skill,<br>
  I&rsquo;ll sing the song of Uncle Bill.</p>
<p>Convivial to the last degree,<br>
  An open-hearted sportsman he.<br>
  Did midnight howls our slumbers rob,<br>
  We said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s uncle &lsquo;on the job&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br>
  When sounds of fight rang sharply out,<br>
  Then Bill was bound to be about,<br>
  The foremost figure in &ldquo;the scrap&rdquo;,<br>
  A terror to the local &ldquo;trap&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To drink, or fight, or maim, or kill,<br>
  Came all alike to Uncle Bill.<br>
  And when he faced the music&rsquo;s squeak<br>
  At Central Court  before the beak,<br>
  How carefully we sought our fob<br>
  To pay his fine of forty bob!<br>
  Recall the happy days of yore<br>
  When Uncle Bill went forth to war!</p>
<p>When all the street with strife was filled<br>
  And both the traps got nearly killed.<br>
  When the lone cabman on the stand<br>
  Was &ldquo;stoushed&rdquo; by Bill&rsquo;s unaided hand,<br>
  And William mounted, filled with rum,<br>
  And drove the cab to kingdom come.<br>
  Remember, too, that famous fray<br>
  When the &ldquo;Black-reds&rdquo;, who hold their sway</p>
<p>O&rsquo;er Surry Hills and Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush,<br>
  Descended on the &ldquo;Liver Push&rdquo;.<br>
  Who cheered both parties long and loud?<br>
  Who heaved blue metal at the crowd!<br>
  And sooled his bulldog, Fighting Bet,<br>
  To bite, haphazard, all she met?<br>
  And when the mob were lodged in gaol<br>
  Who telegraphed to me for bail?</p>
<p>And&mdash;here I think he showed his sense&mdash;<br>
  Who calmly turned Queen&rsquo;s evidence?<br>
  Enough! I now must end my song,<br>
  My needless anguish, why prolong?<br>
  From what I&rsquo;ve said, you&rsquo;ll own, I&rsquo;m sure,<br>
  That Uncle Bill was pretty &ldquo;pure&rdquo;,<br>
  So, rowdies all, your glasses fill,<br>
  And&mdash;drink it standing&mdash;&ldquo;Uncle Bill&rdquo;.</p>

<p align="center" class="note"><i>A Tale of the Elections</i></p>
<p>Our fathers, brave men were and strong,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whisky was their daily liquor;<br>
  They used to move the world along<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In better style than now&mdash;and quicker.<br>
  Elections then were sport, you bet!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A trifle rough, there&rsquo;s no denying<br>
  When two opposing factions met<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skin and hair were always flying.</p>
<p>When &ldquo;cabbage-trees&rdquo; could still be worn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the question, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your hatter?&rdquo;<br>
  There dawned a bright election morn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the town of Parramatta.<br>
  A man called Jones was all the go<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people&rsquo;s friend, the poor&rsquo;s protector;<br>
  A long, gaunt, six-foot slab of woe,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sought to charm the green elector.</p>
<p>Now, Jones had one time been trustee<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his small niece, and he&mdash;the villain!&mdash;<br>
  Betrayed his trust most shamefully,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And robbed the child of every shillin&rsquo;.<br>
  He used to keep accounts, they say,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To save himself in case of trouble;<br>
  Whatever cash he paid away<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always used to charge it double.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d buy the child a cotton gown<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too coarse and rough to dress a cat in,<br>
  And then he&rsquo;d go and put it down<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And charge the price of silk or satin!<br>
  He gave her once a little treat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An outing down the harbour sunny,<br>
  And Lord! the bill for bread and meat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;d think they all had eaten money!</p>
<p>But Jones exposed the course he took<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By carelessness&mdash;such men are ninnies.<br>
  He went and entered in his book<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rdquo;Two pounds of sausages&mdash;two guineas.&rdquo;<br>
  Now this leaked out, and folk got riled,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said that Jones, &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t oughter&rdquo;.<br>
  But what cared Jones? he only smiled&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abuse ran off his back like water.</p>
<p>And so he faced the world content:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His little niece&mdash;he never paid her:<br>
  And then he stood for Parliament,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course he was a rank free trader.<br>
  His wealth was great, success appeared<br>
  To smile propitious on his banner,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Providence  it interfered<br>
  In this most unexpected manner.</p>
<p>A person&mdash;call him Brown for short&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knew the story of this stealer,<br>
  Went calmly down the town and bought<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two pounds of sausage from a dealer,<br>
  And then he got a long bamboo<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tied the sausage tightly to it;<br>
  Says he, &ldquo;This is the thing to do,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am just the man to do it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Jones comes out to make his speech<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I won&rsquo;t a clapper be, nor hisser,<br>
  But with this long bamboo I&rsquo;ll reach<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And poke the sausage in his &lsquo;kisser&rsquo;.<br>
  I&rsquo;ll bring the wretch to scorn and shame,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless those darned police are nigh:<br>
  As sure as Brown&rsquo;s my glorious name,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll knock that candidate kite-high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speech comes on&mdash;beneath the stand<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people push and surge and eddy<br>
  But Brown waits calmly close at hand<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all his apparatus ready;<br>
  And while the speaker loudly cries,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rdquo;Of ages all, this is the boss age!&rdquo;<br>
  Brown hits him square between the eyes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exclaiming, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the price of sausage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He aimed the victuals in his face,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As though he thought poor Jones a glutton.<br>
  And Jones was covered with disgrace<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disgrace and shame, and beef and mutton.<br>
  His cause was lost&mdash;a hopeless wreck<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He crept off from the hooting throng;<br>
  Protection proudly ruled the deck,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here ends the sausage and the song.</p>

  All unknown, and raised to honour,<br>
  Side by side with Dick O&rsquo;Connor,<br>
  In the Council, free from row?<br>

<p>A man once read with a mind surprised<br>
  Of the way that people were &ldquo;hypnotised&rdquo;;<br>
  By waving of hands you produced, forsooth,<br>
  A kind of trance where men told the truth!<br>
  His mind was filled with wond&rsquo;ring doubt;<br>
  He grabbed his hat and he started out,<br>
  He walked the street and he made a &ldquo;set&rdquo;<br>
  At the first half-dozen folk he met.<br>
  He &ldquo;tranced&rdquo; them all, and without a joke<br>
  &rsquo;Twas much as follows the subjects spoke:</p>
<p align="center">First Man</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a doctor, London-made,<br>

  That a dose, or draught, or a lightning pill,<br>
  A little too strong or a little too hot,<br>
  Will work its way to a vital spot.<br>
  And then I watch with a sickly grin<br>
  While the patient &lsquo;passes his counters in&rsquo;.<br>
  But when he has gone with his fleeting breath<br>
  I certify that the cause of death<br>
  Was something Latin, and something long,<br>
  And who is to say that the doctor&rsquo;s wrong!<br>
  So I go my way with a stately tread<br>
  While my patients sleep with the dreamless dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">Next, Please</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a barrister, wigged and gowned;<br>
  Of stately presence and look profound.<br>
  Listen awhile till I show you round.<br>
  When courts are sitting and work is flush<br>
  I hurry about in a frantic rush.<br>
  I take your brief and I look to see<br>
  That the same is marked with a thumping fee;<br>
  But just as your case is drawing near<br>
  I bob serenely and disappear.<br>
  And away in another court I lurk<br>
  While a junior barrister does your work;<br>
  And I ask my fee with a courtly grace,<br>
  Although I never came near the case.<br>
  The loss means ruin to you, maybe,<br>
  But nevertheless I must have my fee!<br>

  In every matter of &pound; s. d.<br>
  I count the money, and night by night<br>
  I balance it up to a farthing right:<br>
  In sooth, &rsquo;twould a stranger&rsquo;s soul perplex<br>
  My double entry and double checks.<br>
  Yet it sometimes happens by some strange crook<br>
  That a ledger-keeper will &lsquo;take his hook&rsquo;<br>
  With a couple of hundred thousand &lsquo;quid&rsquo;,<br>

  With skill he interprets all the scenes&mdash;<br>
  And yet next morning I give him beans.<br>
  I slate his show from the floats to flies,<br>
  Because the beggar won&rsquo;t advertise.<br>
  And sometimes columns of print appear<br>
  About a mine, and it makes it clear<br>
  That the same is all that one&rsquo;s heart could wish&mdash;<br>
  A dozen ounces to every dish.<br>

  With sanctimonious and reverent look<br>
  I read it out of the sacred book<br>
  That he who would open the golden door<br>
  Must give his all to the starving poor.<br>
  But I vary the practice to some extent<br>
  By investing money at twelve per cent,<br>
  And after I&rsquo;ve preached for a decent while<br>
  I clear for &lsquo;home&rsquo; with a lordly pile.<br>
  I frighten my congregation well<br>
  With fear of torment and threats of hell,<br>
  Although I know that the scientists<br>
  Can&rsquo;t find that any such place exists.<br>
  And when they prove it beyond mistake<br>
  That the world took millions of years to make,<br>
  And never was built by the seventh day<br>
  I say in a pained and insulted way<br>
  That &lsquo;Thomas also presumed to doubt&rsquo;,<br>
  And thus do I rub my opponents out.<br>
  For folks may widen their mental range,<br>
  But priest and parson, they never change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With dragging footsteps and downcast head<br>
  The hypnotiser went home to bed,<br>
  And since that very successful test<br>
  He has given the magic art a rest;<br>
  Had he tried the ladies, and worked it right,<br>
  What curious tales might have come to light!</p>

<p>In distant New    Zealand, whose tresses of gold<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The billows are ceaselessly combing,<br>
  Away in a village all tranquil and old<br>
  I came on a market where porkers were sold&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A market for pigs in the gloaming.</p>
<p>And Maoris in plenty in picturesque rig<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lands of their forefathers roaming,<br>
  Were weighing their swine, whether little or big,<br>
  For purchasers paid by the weight of the pig<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weight of the pig in the gloaming.</p>
<p>And one mighty chieftain, I grieve to relate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The while that his porker was foaming<br>
  And squealing like fifty&mdash;that Maori sedate,<br>
  He leant on the pig just to add to its weight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leant on the pig in the gloaming.</p>
<p>Alas! For the buyer, an Irishman stout<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;Grady, I think, his cognomen&mdash;<br>
  Perceived all his doings, and, giving a shout,<br>
  With the butt of his whip laid him carefully out<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the side of his pig in the gloaming.</p>
<p>A terrible scrimmage did straightway begin,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I thought it was time to be homing,<br>
  For Maoris and Irish were fighting like sin<br>
  &rsquo;Midst war-cries of &ldquo;Pakeha!&rdquo; &ldquo;Batherashin!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I fled from the spot in the gloaming.</p>

<p>This G. R. Dibbs was a stalwart man<br>
  Who was built on a most extensive plan,<br>
  And a regular staunch Republican.</p>
<p>But he fell in the hands of the Tory crew<br>
  Who said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame that a man like you<br>
  Should teach Australia  this nasty view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From her mother&rsquo;s side she should ne&rsquo;er be gone,<br>
  And she ought to be glad to be smiled upon,<br>
  And proud to be known as our hanger-on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And G. R. Dibbs, he went off his peg<br>
  At the swells who came for his smiles to beg<br>
  And the Prince of Wales&mdash;who was pulling his leg</p>
<p>And he told them all when the wine had flown,<br>
  &ldquo;The Australian has got no land of his own,<br>
  His home is England,  and there alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he strutted along with the titled band<br>
  And he sold the pride of his native land<br>
  For a bow and a smile and a shake of the hand.</p>
<p>And the Tory drummers they sit and call:<br>
  &ldquo;Send over your leaders great and small;<br>
  For the price is low, and we&rsquo;ll buy them all</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a tinsel title, a tawdry star<br>
  Of a lower grade than our titles are,<br>
  And a puff at a Prince&rsquo;s big cigar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Tories laugh till they crack their ribs<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the folk he has met,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are all in a fret,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they call it champagne,<br>

  This out-of-way country invading,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behaves like a swell,<br>
  Then he&rsquo;s somebody&rsquo;s cook masquerading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;But an out-and-out ass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a thirst for the glass<br>
  And the symptoms of drink on his &ldquo;boko&rdquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is perpetually<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuing the ballet,<br>
  He is always the &ldquo;true Orinoco&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We must slave with our  quills&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep the cash&mdash;pay the bills<br>
  Keep account of the liquor and victuals&mdash;<br>

<p>So, the bank has bust its boiler! And in six or seven year<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will pay me all my money back&mdash;of course!<br>
  But the horse will perish waiting while the grass is germinating,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I reckon I&rsquo;ll be something like the horse.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the ploughing to be finished and the ploughmen want their  pay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&rsquo;d like to wire the fence and sink a tank;<br>
  But I own I&rsquo;m fairly beat how I&rsquo;m going to make ends meet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my money in a reconstructed bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a safe and sure investment!&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s one I can&rsquo;t afford,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I&rsquo;ve got to meet my bills and pay the rent,<br>
  And the cash I had provided (so these meetings have decided)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be collared by the bank at three per cent.</p>
<p>I can draw out half my money, so they tell me, from the Crown;<br>

  For they set to work to shove him, and they sold his house above him,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord! They never gave him time to reconstruct.</p>
<p>And their profits from the business have been twenty-five per  cent,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, I reckon, is a pretty tidy whack,<br>
  And I think it&rsquo;s only proper, now the thing has come a cropper,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they ought to pay a little of it back.</p>
<p>I have read about &ldquo;reserve funds&rdquo;, &ldquo;banking freeholds&rdquo;, and the  like,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till I thought the bank had thousands of assets,<br>
  And it strikes me very funny that they take a fellow&rsquo;s money<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they haven&rsquo;t got enough to pay their debts.</p>
<p>And they say they&rsquo;ve lent my money, and they can&rsquo;t get paid it  back.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know their rates per cent were tens and twelves;<br>
  And if now they&rsquo;ve made a blunder after scooping all this plunder,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, they ought to fork the money out themselves.</p>
<p>So all you bank shareholders, if you won&rsquo;t pay what you owe,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will find that on your bank will fall a blight;<br>
  And the reason is because it&rsquo;s simply certain that deposits<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will be stopped, the bank will bust, and serve you  right!</p>

    <b><a name="TheGhostOfTheMurderersHut"></a>The Ghost Of The Murderer&rsquo;s Hut</b></h2>
<p>My horse had been lamed in the foot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rocks at the back of the run,<br>
  So I camped at the Murderer&rsquo;s Hut,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the place where the murder was done.</p>
<p>The walls were all spattered with gore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A terrible symbol of guilt;<br>
  And the bloodstains were fresh on the floor<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the blood of the victim was spilt.</p>
<p>The wind hurried past with a shout,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunderstorm doubled its din<br>
  As I shrank from the danger without,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And recoiled from the horror within.</p>
<p>When lo! at the window a shape,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A creature of infinite dread;<br>
  A thing with the face of an ape,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with eyes like the eyes of the dead.</p>
<p>With the horns of a fiend, and a skin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was hairy as satyr or elf,<br>
  And a long, pointed beard on its chin&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My God! &rsquo;twas the Devil himself.</p>
<p>In anguish I sank on the floor,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With terror my features were stiff,<br>
  Till the thing gave a kind of a roar,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ending up with a resonant &ldquo;Biff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a cheer burst aloud from my throat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the thing that my spirit did vex<br>
  Was naught but an elderly goat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a goat of the masculine sex.</p>
<p>When his master was killed he had fled,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, by the dingoes bereft,<br>
  The nannies were all of them dead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only the billy was left.</p>
<p>So we had him brought in on a stage<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the house where, in style, he can strut,<br>
  And he lives to a fragrant old age<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Ghost of the Murderer&rsquo;s Hut.</p>

<p>It was the Bondi golfing man<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drove off from the golf house tee,<br>
  And he had taken his little daughter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bear him company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Father, why do you swing the club<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flourish it such a lot?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;You watch it fly o&rsquo;er the fences high!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he tried with a brassey shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Father, why did you hit the fence<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just there where the brambles twine?&rdquo;<br>
  And the father he answered never a word,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he got on the green in nine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Father, hark from behind those trees,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What dismal yells arrive!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a man I ween on the second green,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&rsquo;ve landed him with my drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Father, why does the poor Chinee<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall down on his knees and cry?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;He taketh me for his Excellency,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he thinks once hit twice shy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So on they fared to the waterhole,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he drove with a lot of dash,<br>
  But the balls full soon in the dread lagoon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell down with a woeful splash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Father, why do you beat the sand<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it flies like the carded wool?&rdquo;<br>
  And the father he answered never a word,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his heart was much too full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Father, why are they shouting &lsquo;fore&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And screaming so lustily?&rdquo;<br>
  But the father he answered never a word,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pallid corpse was he.</p>
<p>For a well-swung drive on the back of his head<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had landed and laid him low.<br>

<p>Of course they all say if this Bobadil starts<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;ll settle &rsquo;em all in a flash:<br>
  For the pace he can go will be breaking their hearts,<br>

  Crosslake! He&rsquo;s inbred to the Yattendon line,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, he needs to be rather a star!<br>
  And with seven stone ten we will trust the old black,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we know what the Yattendons are.</p>
<p>He is sired by Lochiel, which ensures that his pace<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is enough, and a little to spare.<br>
  But the blood that will tell at the end of the race<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the blood of the Yattendon mare.<br>
  And this &ldquo;Bobby&rdquo; will find, when the whips are about,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s a very fast journey and far.<br>
  And there&rsquo;s just the least doubt&mdash;will he battle it out?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we know what the Yattendons are.</p>
<p>In the rest of the field there are some that can stay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a few that can fly&mdash;while they last.<br>
  But the old black outsider will go all the way,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finish uncommonly fast.<br>
  If his feet last him out to the end of the trip&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bare-footed or shod with a bar<br>
  If he once gets this Bobadil under the whip,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he&rsquo;ll show what the Yattendons are.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a writer of renown.<br>
  He had striven finer feelings<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our natures to implant<br>
  By his Treatise on the Morals<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had trodden unawares<br>
  On his &ldquo;Reasons for Bare Patches<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Female Native Bears&rdquo;.<br>
  So they gave him an appointment<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As instructor to a band<br>
  Of the most attractive females<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be gathered in the land.<br>
  &rsquo;Twas a &ldquo;Ladies&rsquo; Science Circle&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the latest social fad<br>

  They were fond of &ldquo;science rambles&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the country from the town&mdash;<br>
  A parade of female beauty<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the leadership of Brown.<br>
  They would pick a place for luncheon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And catch beetles on their rugs;<br>
  The Professor called &rsquo;em &ldquo;optera&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They called &rsquo;em &ldquo;nasty bugs&rdquo;.<br>
  Well, the thing was bound to perish<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For no lovely woman can<br>

  But the breath of Fate blew on it<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sharp and sudden blast,<br>
  And the &ldquo;Ladies&rsquo; Science Circle&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a memory of the past.</p>
<p>There were two-and-twenty members,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mostly young and mostly fair,<br>
  Who had made a great excursion<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a place called Dontknowwhere,<br>
  At the crossing of Lost   River,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road to No Man&rsquo;s Land.<br>
  There they met an old selector,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a stockwhip in his hand,<br>
  And the sight of so much beauty<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent him slightly &ldquo;off his nut&rdquo;;<br>
  So he asked them, smiling blandly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Would they come down to the hut?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;I am come,&rdquo; said the Professor,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his thin and reedy voice,<br>
  &ldquo;To investigate your flora,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which I hear is very choice.&rdquo;<br>
  The selector stared dumbfounded,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till at last he found his tongue:<br>
  &ldquo;To investigate my Flora!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, you howlin&rsquo; Brigham Young!<br>

  That you wizened little fellers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a hundred times the worst!</p>
<p>But a dried-up ape like you are,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be marchin&rsquo; through the land<br>
  With a pack of lovely wimmen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I cannot understand!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;You mistake,&rdquo; said the Professor,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a most indignant tone<br>
  While the ladies shrieked and jabbered<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a fashion of their own&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;You mistake about these ladies,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m a lecturer of theirs;<br>
  I am Brown, who wrote the Treatise<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Female Native Bears!<br>
  When I said we wanted flora,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I meant was native flowers.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Well, you said you wanted Flora,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&rsquo;ll swear you don&rsquo;t get ours!<br>
  But here&rsquo;s Flora&rsquo;s self a-comin&rsquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it&rsquo;s time for you to skip,<br>
  Or I&rsquo;ll write a treatise on you,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&rsquo;ll write it with the whip!</p>
<p>Now, I want no explanations;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just you hook it out of sight,<br>
  Or you&rsquo;ll charm the poor girl some&rsquo;ow!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Professor looked in fright:<br>
  She was six feet high and freckled,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her hair was turkey-red.<br>
  The Professor gave a whimper,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And threw down his bag and fled,<br>
  And the Ladies&rsquo; Science Circle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a simultaneous rush,<br>
  Travelled after its Professor,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And went screaming through the bush!</p>
<p>At the crossing of Lost River,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the road to No Man&rsquo;s Land,<br>
  Where the grim and ghostly gumtrees<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Block the view on every hand,<br>
  There they weep and wail and wander,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always seeking for the track,<br>
  For the hapless old Professor<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hasn&rsquo;t sense to guide &rsquo;em back;<br>
  And they clutch at one another,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they yell and scream in fright<br>
  As they see the gruesome creatures<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the grim Australian night;<br>
  And they hear the mopoke&rsquo;s hooting,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dingo&rsquo;s howl so dread,<br>
  And the flying foxes&rsquo; jabber<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the gum trees overhead;<br>
  While the weird and wary wombats,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their subterranean caves,<br>
  Are a-digging, always digging,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At those wretched people&rsquo;s graves;<br>
  And the pike-horned Queensland bullock,<br>

  A fellow has to carry every blooming thing he&rsquo;s got;<br>
  Whatever he puts down they&rsquo;ll commandeer it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So after much anxiety our simple-minded elf<br>
  He thought he&rsquo;d do a little commandeering for himself,<br>
  And the first thing that he noticed was a bottle on a shelf<br>
  In a cottage, so he thought he&rsquo;d commandeer it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ho!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;a bottle, and, by George, it&rsquo;s full of beer,<br>
  And no commanding officer to come and interfere.<br>
  Here&rsquo;s my own blooming health,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the commandeer.&rdquo;<br>
  And without another word he commandeered it.</p>
<p>On his subsequent proceedings we must draw a little veil,<br>
  For the Boers had left some sheep dip in that bottle labelled &ldquo;Ale&rdquo;;<br>
  But the doctor said he&rsquo;d shift it&mdash;if all other methods fail,<br>
  We must use the stomach pump and commandeer it.</p>

<p align="center" class="note">Tune: &ldquo;<i>Ballyhooley</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now ye gallant Sydney  boys, who have left your household joys<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To march across the sea in search of glory,<br>
  I am very much afraid that you do not love parade,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the rum parade is quite another story.<br>
  For the influenza came and to spoil its little game,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They ordered we should drink a curious mixture;<br>
  Though at first it frightened some, when they found it mostly rum,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parade became a very pleasant fixture.</p>
<p><i>&nbsp;Chorus</i></p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s forward the Brigade, if they&rsquo;ll hold a rum parade<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Pretoria  there&rsquo;s nothing to alarm ye;<br>
  And it&rsquo;s easy to be seen if they leave the quinine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye&rsquo;ll be there before the blessed British Army.</p>
<p>Then a corporal he come and he said I drank the rum,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the quinine never reached its destination;<br>
  For begob he up and swored that I threw it overboard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure my heart was filled with grief and indignation.</p>
<p>For I&rsquo;m different to some, I prefer quinine to rum,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I only take the rum just as a favour,<br>
  And it&rsquo;s easy to be seen I&rsquo;m so fond of the quinine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I keep it lest the rum should spoil its flavour.</p>
<p>When we get to Africay we&rsquo;ll be landed straight away,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And quartered with the troops of Queen Victoria;<br>
  And we hope they&rsquo;ll understand that the moment that we land<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are ready for a march upon Pretoria.</p>
<p>And we&rsquo;ll pay off all the scores on old Kruger and his Boers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just to prove our manners aren&rsquo;t a failure,<br>
  And to show we are not mean, shure we&rsquo;ll give them the quinine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drink the rum in honour of Australia.</p>

  And the man who upholds any different views, the same is a rotten Pro-Boer!<br>
  (Though I&rsquo;m getting a little bit doubtful myself, as it drags on week after  week:<br>
  But it&rsquo;s better to not ask any questions at all&mdash;let us silence all doubts with  a shriek!)</p>
<p>And first let us shriek the unstinted abuse that the Tory Press  prefer<br>
  De Wet is a madman, and Steyn is a liar, and Kruger a pitiful cur!<br>
  (Though I think if Oom Paul&mdash;as old as he is&mdash;were to walk down the Strand with his gun,<br>
  A lot of these heroes would hide in the sewers or take to their heels and run!<br>
  For Paul he has fought like a man in his day, but now that he&rsquo;s feeble and weak<br>
  And tired, and lonely, and old and grey, of course it&rsquo;s quite safe to shriek!)</p>
<p>And next let us join in the bloodthirsty shriek, Hooray for Lord  Kitchener&rsquo;s &ldquo;bag&rdquo;!<br>
  For the fireman&rsquo;s torch and the hangman&rsquo;s cord&mdash;they are hung on the English  Flag!<br>
  In the front of our brave old army! Whoop! the farmhouse blazes bright.<br>
  And their women weep and their children die&mdash;how dare they presume to fight!</p>
<p>For none of them dress in a uniform, the same as by rights they  ought.<br>
  They&rsquo;re fighting in rags and in naked feet, like Wallace&rsquo;s Scotchmen fought!<br>
  (And they clothe themselves from our captured troops&mdash;and they&rsquo;re catching them  every week;<br>
  And they don&rsquo;t hang them&mdash;and the shame is ours, but we cover the shame with a  shriek!)</p>
<p>And, lastly, we&rsquo;ll shriek the political shriek as we sit in the  dark and doubt;<br>
  Where the Birmingham Judas led us in, and there&rsquo;s no one to lead us out.<br>
  And Rosebery&mdash;whom we depended upon! Would only the Oracle speak!<br>
  &ldquo;You go to the Grocers,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;for your laws!&rdquo; By heavens! it&rsquo;s time to  shriek!</p>

  To touch the dock at Cockatoo.</p>
<p>Of all the ministerial clan<br>
  There was no nicer, worthier man<br>
  Than Admiral O&rsquo;Sullivan.</p>
<p>Of course we mean E. W.<br>

  Controlled the dock at Cockatoo.</p>
<p>To workmen he explained his views&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;You need not toil unless you choose,<br>
  Your only work is drawing screws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And sometimes to their great surprise<br>
  When votes of censure filled the skies<br>
  He used to give them all a rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What odds about a pound or two?&rdquo;<br>
  Exclaimed the great E. W.<br>
  O&rsquo;Sullivan at Cockatoo.</p>
<p>The dockyard superintendent, he<br>
  Was not at all what he should be&mdash;<br>
  He sneered at all this sympathy.</p>
<p>So when he gave a man the sack<br>
  O&rsquo;Sullivan got on his track<br>
  And straightway went and fetched him back.</p>
<p>And with a sympathetic tear<br>
  He&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;How dare you interfere,<br>
  You most misguided engineer?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your sordid manners please amend&mdash;<br>
  No man can possibly offend<br>
  Who has a Member for a friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With euchre, or a friendly rub,<br>
  And whisky from the nearest &lsquo;pub&rsquo;,<br>
  We&rsquo;ll make the dockyard like a club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heave ho, my hearties, play away,<br>
  We&rsquo;ll do no weary work today.<br>
  What odds&mdash;the public has to pay!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if the public should complain<br>
  I&rsquo;ll go to Broken Hill by train<br>
  To watch McCarthy making rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there, with nothing else to do<br>
  No doubt the great E. W.<br>

<p>The Premier and the Socialist<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were walking through the State:<br>
  They wept to see the Savings Bank<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such funds accumulate.<br>
  &ldquo;If these were only cleared away,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said, &ldquo;it would be great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If three financial amateurs<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Controlled them for a year,<br>

  &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; said the Socialist;<br>

<p>&ldquo;But not on us,&rdquo; the Savings cried,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falling a little flat,<br>
  &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t think a man like you<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would do a thing like that;<br>
  For most of us are very small,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And none of us are fat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This haughty tone,&rdquo; the Premier said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Is not the proper line;<br>
  Before I&rsquo;d be dictated to<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My billet I&rsquo;d resign!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;How brightly,&rdquo; said the Socialist,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Those little sovereigns shine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Premier and the Socialist<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had their bit of fun;<br>
  They tried to call the Savings back<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But answer came there none,<br>
  Because the back-block Cockatoos<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had eaten every one.</p>

<p>My son, if you go to the races to battle with Ikey and Mo,<br>
  Remember, it&rsquo;s seldom the pigeon can pick out the eye of the crow;<br>
  Remember, they live by the business; remember, my son, and go slow!</p>
<p>If ever an owner should tell you, &ldquo;Back mine&rdquo;&mdash;don&rsquo;t you be such a  flat.<br>
  He knows his own cunning no doubt&mdash;does he know what the others are at?<br>
  Find out what he&rsquo;s frightened of most, and invest a few dollars on that.</p>
<p>Walk not in the track of the trainer, nor hang round the rails at  his stall.<br>
  His wisdom belongs to his patron&mdash;shall he give it to one and to all?<br>
  When the stable is served he may tell you&mdash;and his words are like jewels let  fall.</p>
<p>Run wide of the tipster, who whispers that Borak is sure to be  first,<br>
  He tells the next mug that he meets with a tale with the placings reversed;<br>
  And, remember, of judges of racing, the jockey&rsquo;s the absolute worst.</p>
<p>When they lay three to one on the field, and the runners are  twenty-and-two,<br>
  Take a pull at yourself; take a pull&mdash;it&rsquo;s a mighty big field to get through.<br>
  Is the club handicapper a fool? If a fool is about, perhaps it&rsquo;s you!</p>
<p>Beware of the critic who tells you the handicap&rsquo;s absolute rot,<br>
  For this is chucked in, and that&rsquo;s hopeless, and somebody ought to be shot.<br>
  How is it he can&rsquo;t make a fortune himself when he knows such a lot?</p>
<p>From tipsters, and jockeys, and trials, and gallops, the glory has  gone,<br>
  For this is the wisdom of Hafiz that sages have pondered upon,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That led Australia&rsquo;s van,<br>
  For never shall their glory fade<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In minds Australian.</p>
<p>Fight on, fight on, unflinchingly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till right and justice reign.<br>
  Fight on, fight on, till Victory<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall send you home again.</p>
<p>And with Australia&rsquo;s  flag shall fly<br>
  A spray of wattle bough,<br>
  To symbolise our unity,<br>
  We&rsquo;re all Australians now.</p>

<p>They came from the lower levels<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep down in the Brilliant mine;<br>
  From the wastes where the whirlwind revels,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whirling the leaves of pine.</p>
<p>On the western plains, where the Darling flows,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dust storms wheel and shift,<br>
  The teamster loosened his yokes and bows,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turned his team adrift.</p>
<p>On the western stations, far and wide,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s many an empty pen,<br>
  For the &ldquo;ringers&rdquo; have cast the machines aside<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And answered the call for men.</p>
<p>On the lucerne flats where the stream runs slow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Hunter finds the sea,<br>
  The women are driving the mowers now,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the children at their knee.</p>
<p>For the men have gone, as a man must go,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the call of the rolling drums;<br>
  For the men have sworn that the Turks shall know<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the old battalion comes.</p>
<p>Column of companies by the right,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steady in strong array,<br>
  With the sun on the bayonets gleaming bright,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battalion marched away.</p>
<p>They battled, the old battalion,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the toil of the training camps,<br>
  Sweated and strove at lectures,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the light of the stinking lamps.</p>
<p>Marching, shooting, and drilling;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steady and slow and stern;<br>
  Awkward and strange, but willing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of their job to learn.</p>
<p>Learning to use the rifle;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning to use the spade;<br>
  Deeming fatigue a trifle<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During each long parade.</p>
<p>Till at last they welded<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a concrete whole,<br>
  And there grew in the old battalion<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A kind of battalion&rsquo;s soul.</p>
<p>Brotherhood never was like it;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friendship is not the word;<br>
  But deep in that body of marching men<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of a nation stirred.</p>
<p>And like one man with a single thought<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheery and confident;<br>
  Ready for all that the future brought,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old battalion went.</p>
<p>Column of companies by the right,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steady in strong array,<br>
  With the sun on the bayonets gleaming bright,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battalion marched away.</p>
<p>How shall we tell of their landing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the hills where the foe were spread,<br>
  And the track of the old battalion<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was marked by the Turkish dead?</p>
<p>With the dash that discipline teaches,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the hail of the shrapnel flew,<br>
  And the forts were raking the beaches,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the toll of the dead men grew.</p>
<p>They fixed their grip on the gaunt hillside<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a pluck that has won them fame;<br>
  And the home-folks know that the dead men died<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the pride of Australia&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Column of companies by the right,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the beat of the rolling drums;<br>
  With honours gained in a stirring fight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Battalion comes!</p>

<p>Oh the airman&rsquo;s game is a showman&rsquo;s game for we all of us watch  him go<br>
  With his roaring soaring aeroplane and his bombs for the blokes below,<br>
  Over the railways and over the dumps, over the Hun and the Turk,<br>
  You&rsquo;ll hear him mutter, &ldquo;What ho, she bumps,&rdquo; when the Archies get to work.<br>
  But not of him is the song I sing, though he follow the eagle&rsquo;s flight,<br>
  And with shrapnel holes in his splintered wing comes home to his roost at  night.<br>
  He may silver his wings on the shining stars, he may look from the throne on  high,<br>
  He may follow the flight of the wheeling kite in the blue Egyptian sky,<br>
  But he&rsquo;s only a hero built to plan, turned out by the Army schools,<br>
  And I sing of the rankless, thankless man who hustles the Army mules.</p>
<p>Now where he comes from and where he lives is a mystery dark and  dim,<br>
  And it&rsquo;s rarely indeed that the General gives a D.S.O. to him.<br>
  The stolid infantry digs its way like a mole in a ruined wall;<br>
  The cavalry lends a tone, they say, to what were else but a brawl;<br>
  The Brigadier of the Mounted Fut like a cavalry Colonel swanks<br>
  When he goeth abroad like a gilded nut to receive the General&rsquo;s thanks;<br>
  The Ordnance man is a son of a gun and his lists are a standing joke;<br>
  You order, &ldquo;Choke arti Jerusalem  one&rdquo; for Jerusalem artichoke.<br>
  The Medicals shine with a number nine, and the men of the great R.E.,<br>
  Their Colonels are Methodist, married or mad, and some of them all the three;<br>
  In all these units the road to fame is taught in the Army schools,<br>
  But a man has got to be born to the game when he tackles the Army mules.</p>
<p>For if you go where the depots are as the dawn is breaking grey,<br>
  By the waning light of the morning star as the dust cloud clears away,<br>
  You&rsquo;ll see a vision among the dust like a man and a mule combined&mdash;<br>
  It&rsquo;s the kind of thing you must take on trust for its outlines aren&rsquo;t defined,<br>
  A thing that whirls like a spinning top and props like a three legged stool,<br>
  And you find its a long-legged Queensland  boy convincing an Army mule.<br>
  And the rider sticks to the hybrid&rsquo;s hide like paper sticks to a wall,<br>
  For a &ldquo;magnoon&rdquo; Waler is next to ride with every chance of a fall,<br>
  It&rsquo;s a rough-house game and a thankless game, and it isn&rsquo;t a game for a fool,<br>
  For an army&rsquo;s fate and a nation&rsquo;s fame may turn on an army mule.</p>
<p>And if you go to the front-line camp where the sleepless outposts  lie,<br>
  At the dead of night you can hear the tramp of the mule train toiling by.<br>
  The rattle and clink of a leading-chain, the creak of the lurching load,<br>
  As the patient, plodding creatures strain at their task in the shell-torn road,<br>
  Through the dark and the dust you may watch them go till the dawn is grey in  the sky,<br>
  And only the watchful pickets know when the &ldquo;All-night Corps&rdquo; goes by.<br>
  And far away as the silence falls when the last of the train has gone,<br>
  A weary voice through the darkness: &ldquo;Get on there, men, get on!&rdquo;<br>
  It isn&rsquo;t a hero, built to plan, turned out by the modern schools,<br>
  It&rsquo;s only the Army Service man a-driving his Army mules.</p>

  I can sleep all night on picket, but I can&rsquo;t sleep in my bed&rdquo;.<br>

<p>The grey gull sat on a floating whale,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a floating whale sat he,<br>
  And he told his tale of the storm and the gale,<br>
  And the ships that he saw with steam and sail,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he flew by the Northern Sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen a sign that is strange and new,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I never before did see:<br>
  A flying ship that roared as it flew,<br>
  The storm and the tempest driving through,<br>
  It carried a flag and it carried a crew,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what would that be?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the flag was a Jack with stars displayed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flag that is new to me;<br>
  For it does not ply in the Northern trade,<br>
  But it drove through the storm-wrack unafraid,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what is that flag?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen that flag that is starred with white,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said a southern gull, said he,<br>
  &ldquo;And I saw it fly in a bloody fight,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crashed on the Cocos lee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who are these folk whose flag is first<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the flags that fly<br>

  Of the great North Sea where the bergs are  nursed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Northern Lights ride high?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Australian folk,&rdquo; said a lone sea-mew,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The Australian flag,&rdquo; said he.<br>
  &ldquo;It is strange that a folk that is far and few<br>
  Should fly their flag where there never flew<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another flag!&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have followed their flag in the fields of France,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its white stars flying free,<br>
  And no misfortune and no mischance<br>
  Could turn them back from their line of advance,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the line that they held,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherever there&rsquo;s ever a rule to break,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever they oughtn&rsquo;t to be,<br>
  With a death to dare and a risk to take,<br>
  A track to find or a way to make,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will find them there,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They come from a land that is parched with thirst,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An inland land,&rdquo; said he,<br>
  &ldquo;On risk and danger their breed is nursed,<br>
  And thus it happens their flag is first<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fly in the Northern Sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though Hawker perished, he overcame<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risks of the storm and the sea,<br>

  We&rsquo;ve swum the Di&rsquo;mantina with our raiment in a bag,<br>

  For they gave us no selection &lsquo;twixt a Ford or Rolls de Royce<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we did it in our good Australian boots.</p>
<p>They called us &ldquo;mad Australians&rdquo;; they couldn&rsquo;t understand<br>

<p>In the good old days when the Army&rsquo;s ways were simple and  unrefined,<br>
  With a stock to keep up their chins in front, and a pigtail down behind,<br>
  When the only light in the barracks at night was a candle of grease or fat,<br>
  When they put the extinguisher on the light, they called it the Old Tin Hat.</p>
<p>Now, a very great man is the C. in C., for he is the whole of the  show&mdash;<br>
  The reins and the whip and the driver&rsquo;s hand that maketh the team to go&mdash;<br>
  But the road he goes is a lonely road, with ever a choice to make,<br>
  When he comes to a place where the roads divide, which one is the road to take.<br>
  For there&rsquo;s one road right, and there&rsquo;s one road wrong, uphill, or over the  flat,<br>
  And one road leads to the Temple   of Fame, and one to the  Old Tin Hat.</p>
<p>And a very great man is the man who holds an Army Corps command,<br>
  For he hurries his regiments here and there as the C. in C. has planned.<br>
  By day he travels about in state and stirreth them up to rights,<br>
  He toileth early and toileth late, and sitteth up half the nights;<br>
  But the evening comes when the candle throws twin shadows upon the mat,<br>
  And one of the shadows is like a wreath, and one like an Old Tin Hat.</p>
<p>And a very proud man is the Brigadier at the sound of the stately  tread<br>
  Of his big battalions marching on, as he rides with his staff ahead.<br>
  There&rsquo;s never a band to play them out, and the bugle&rsquo;s note is still,<br>
  But he hears two tunes in the gentle breeze that blows from over the hill.<br>
  And one is a tune in a stirring key, and the other is faint and flat,<br>
  For one is the tune of &ldquo;My new C.B.&rdquo; and the other, &ldquo;My Old Tin Hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Colonel heading his regiment is life and soul of the show,<br>
  It&rsquo;s &ldquo;Column of route&rdquo;, &ldquo;Form troops&rdquo;, &ldquo;Extend&rdquo;, and into the fight they go;<br>
  He does not duck when the air is full of the &ldquo;wail of the whimpering lead&rdquo;,<br>
  He does not scout for the deep dugout when the &rsquo;planes are overhead;<br>
  He fears not hog, nor devil, nor dog, and he&rsquo;d scrap with a mountain cat,<br>
  But he goeth in fear of the Brigadier, and in fear of the Old Tin Hat.</p>

<p>O west of all that a man holds dear, on the edge of the Kingdom Come,<br>
  Where carriage is far too high for beer, and the pubs keep only rum,<br>
  On the sunburnt ways of the Outer Back, on the plains of the darkening scrub,<br>
  I have followed the wandering teamster&rsquo;s track, and it always led to a pub.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always in man some gift to show, some power he can  command,<br>
  And mine is the Gift that I always know when a pub is close at hand;<br>
  I can pick them out on the London  streets, though most of their pubs are queer,<br>
  Such solid-looking and swell retreats, with never a sign of beer.</p>
<p>In the march of the boys through Palestine when the noontide fervour glowed,<br>
  Over the desert in thirsty line our sunburnt squadrons rode.<br>
  They looked at the desert lone and drear, stone ridges and stunted scrub,<br>
  And said, &ldquo;We should have had Ginger here, I bet he&rsquo;d have found a pub!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We started out in the noonday heat on a trip that was fast and  far,<br>
  We took in one each side of the street to balance the blooming car,<br>
  But then we started a long dry run on a road we did not know,<br>
  In the blinding gleam of the noonday sun, with the dust as white as snow.</p>
<p>For twenty minutes without a drink we strove with our dreadful  thirst,<br>
  But the chauffeur pointed and said, &ldquo;I think &mdash;,&rdquo; I answered &ldquo;I saw it first!&rdquo;<br>
  A pub with a good old-fashioned air, with bottles behind the blind,<br>
  And a golden tint in the barmaid&rsquo;s hair&mdash;I could see it all&mdash;in my mind</p>
<p>Ere ever the motor ceased its roar, ere ever the chauffeur knew,<br>
  I made a dash for the open door and madly darted through.<br>
  I looked for the barmaid, golden-crowned as they were in the good old time,<br>
  And&mdash;shades of Hennessy!&mdash;what I found was a wowser selling &ldquo;lime!&rdquo;<br>
  And the scoundrel said as he stopped to put on his lime-washed boots a rub,<br>
  &ldquo;The Local Option voted it shut, it ain&rsquo;t no longer a pub!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas then I rose to my greatest heights in dignified retreat<br>
  (The greatest men in the world&rsquo;s great fights are those who are great in  defeat).<br>
  I shall think with pride till the day I die of my confidence sublime,<br>
  For I looked the wowser straight in the eye, and asked for a pint of lime.</p>

  The coloured congregation sat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And waited with expectant air.<br>
  At last from one far-distant seat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Gilgai&rsquo;s Mary&rsquo;d been asleep,<br>
  There came a kind of plaintive bleat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Say, boss! Who won the harp-crown sweep?&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center" class="note"><i>A  Political Ballad by our Bolshevik Bard</i></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dashin&rsquo; sort of boy<br>
  Which they call his Party&rsquo;s Joy,<br>
  And his smile-that-won&rsquo;t-come-off would quite disarm ye;<br>
  And he played the leadin&rsquo; hand<br>
  In the Helter-Skelter Band,<br>
  Known as Jimmy Dooley&rsquo;s Circulating Army.<br>
  When the rank and file they found,<br>
  They were marchin&rsquo; round and round,<br>
  They one and all began to act unruly;<br>
  And the letter that he wrote,<br>
  Sure it got the Labor goat,<br>
  So we set ourselves to deal with Captain Dooley.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Chorus</p>
<p>Whill-il-loo. High Ho!<br>
  We&rsquo;ll all be there you know,<br>
  The repartees and ructions they will charm ye;<br>
  And we&rsquo;ll see which we prefer,<br>
  Is it Dooley or McGirr,<br>
  To take command of Jimmy Dooley&rsquo;s Army.</p>
<p>When we&rsquo;re marchin&rsquo; to the poll,<br>
  And we&rsquo;re under his control,<br>
  We sometimes feel a trifle unsalubrious;<br>
  For by one and all &rsquo;twas said<br>
  That if our objective&rsquo;s Red,<br>
  To call it claret-coloured makes us dubious.<br>
  Sure, the Fat Men one fine day<br>
  They chanced to come our way,<br>
  And we thought that we should bate them well and trooly;<br>
  But we let them pass us by<br>
  And not half a brick did fly,<br>
  &rsquo;Twas then we tore our tickets up on Dooley.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Chorus</p>
<p>Whill-il-loo. High Ho!<br>
  We&rsquo;ll all be there you know,<br>
  The repartees and ructions they will charm ye;<br>

  Is it Dooley or McGirr,<br>
  To take command of Jimmy Dooley&rsquo;s Army.</p>

<p>The Editor wrote his political screed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ink that was fainter and fainter;<br>
  He rose to the call of his country&rsquo;s need,<br>
  And in spiderish characters wrote with speed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A column on &ldquo;Cutting the Painter&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;reader&rdquo; sat in his high-backed chair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For literals he was a hunter;<br>
  But he stared aghast at the column long<br>
  Of the editorial hot and strong,<br>
  For the comp. inspired by some sense of wrong<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had headed it &ldquo;Gutting the Punter&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="note"><i>A man named McGuinness and  his wife are leaving Australia  because the<br>

washing and cooking.</i></p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s dreadful to think in a country like this<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its chances for work&mdash;and enjoyment<br>
  That a man like McGuinness was certain to miss<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever he tried for employment.</p>
<p>He wrote to employers from Bondi to Bourke,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Woolloomooloo to Glen Innes,<br>
  But he found&mdash;though his wife could get plenty of work&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was never a job for McGuinness.</p>
<p>But perhaps&mdash;later on&mdash;when the Chow and the Jap<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begin to drift down from the tropics,<br>
  When a big yellow stain spreading over the map<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provides some disquieting topics,</p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s then when they&rsquo;re wanting a man that will stand<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the trench where his own kith and kin is,<br>
  With a frown on his face and a gun in his hand&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there might be a job for McGuinness!</p>

<p>There were three soldiers who went to the war,<br>
  (Chorus) Well, why not?<br>
  They&rsquo;d arms and legs and plenty of jaw,<br>
  (Chorus) All they&rsquo;d got!<br>
  They reckoned the first three years were the worst<br>
  And anything&rsquo;s yours if you see it first,<br>
  Whatever you do, take care of your thirst.<br>
  (Chorus) Well, why not?</p>
<p>And they made their way to the dry canteen,<br>
  (Chorus) Well, why not?<br>
  The drinks all tasted of gasoline,<br>
  (Chorus) All they&rsquo;d got!<br>
  They handed the orderly bloke a wink,<br>
  He made them up a gallon of drink,<br>
  The sort for turning an elephant pink.<br>
  (Chorus) Well, why not?</p>
<p>There were three horses were hanging outside,<br>
  (Chorus) Well, why not?<br>
  Said they, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take the three for a ride.&rdquo;<br>
  (Chorus) All they&rsquo;d got!<br>
  They galloped the garrison through and through,<br>
  The sergeant ran like a kangaroo,<br>
  They reckoned the sergeant-major flew.<br>
  (Chorus) Well, why not?</p>
<p>The corporal came and gathered &rsquo;em in,<br>

  &ldquo;We run this place to oblige you chaps,<br>
  The colonel may shorten your lives, perhaps.&rdquo;<br>

<p>Oh Captain Cook he was a sailor<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sail, oh, sail away,<br>
  He sailed until he found Australia<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sail to Sydney Bay,<br>
  For the wind blows fair, and the wind blows free<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sydney town&rsquo;s the town for me<br>
  The brave old town by the Southern Sea<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sail, oh, sail away.</p>
<p>Oh Kingsford Smith, the aviator<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fly, oh, fly away<br>
  He was the air&rsquo;s great navigator<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fly to Sydney   Bay,<br>
  And he steered his course by the stars and skies<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no man knows where now he lies<br>
  Till trumpets sound and the dead arise<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fly, oh, fly away.</p>
<p>Sir John Monash, he fought in Flanders<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fight to keep us free<br>
  The wisest man of our commanders<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fight by land and sea<br>
  And we&rsquo;d scorn to flinch from a foe&rsquo;s attack<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had we the soul of Monash back<br>
  To fly his flag on the well-worn track<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fight for victory.</p>
