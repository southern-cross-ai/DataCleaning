<h1>The Submarine Boat</h1>

<h3>by</h3>

<h2>Clifford Ashdown</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>Tric-trac! tric-trac! went the black and white discs as the
players moved them over the backgammon board in expressive
justification of the French term for the game. Tric-trac! They are
indeed a nation of poets, reflected Mr Pringle. Was not Teuf-teuf!
for the motor-car a veritable inspiration? And as he smoked, the not
unmusical clatter of the enormous wooden discs filled the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>In these days of cookery not entirely based upon
air-tights&mdash;to use the expressive Americanism for tinned
meats&mdash;it is no longer necessary for the man who wishes to dine,
as distinguished from the mere feeding animal, to furtively seek some
restaurant in remote Soho, jealously guarding its secret from his
fellows. But Mr Pringle, in his favourite study of human nature, was
an occasional visitor to the 'Poissoni&egrave;re' in Gerrard Street,
and, the better to pursue his researches, had always denied
familiarity with the foreign tongues he heard around him. The
restaurant was distinctly close&mdash;indeed, some might have called
it stuffy&mdash;and Pringle, though near a ventilator, thoughtfully
provided by the management, was fast being lulled into drowsiness,
when a man who had taken his seat with a companion at the next table
leaned across the intervening gulf and addressed him.</p>

<p>'Nous ne vous d&eacute;rangeons pas, monsieur?'</p>

<p>Pringle, with a smile of fatuous uncomprehending, bowed, but said
never a word.</p>

<p>'Cochon d'Anglais, n'entendez-vous pas?'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid I do not understand,' returned Pringle, shaking his
head hopelessly, but still smiling.</p>

<p>'Canaille! Faut-il que je vous tire le nez?' persisted the
Frenchman, as, apparently still sceptical of Pringle's assurance, he
added threats to abuse.</p>

<p>'I have known the English gentleman a long time, and without a
doubt he does not understand French,' testified the waiter who had
now come forward for orders. Satisfied by this corroboration of
Pringle's innocence, the Frenchman bowed and smiled sweetly to him,
and, ordering a bottle of Clos de Vougeot, commenced an earnest
conversation with his neighbour.</p>

<p>By the time this little incident had closed, Pringle's drowsiness
had given place to an intense feeling of curiosity. For what purpose
could the Frenchman have been so insistent in disbelieving his
expressed ignorance of the language? Why, too, had he striven to make
Pringle betray himself by resenting the insults showered upon him? In
a Parisian restaurant, as he knew, far more trivial affronts had
ended in meetings in the Bois de Boulogne. Besides, cochon was an
actionable term of opprobrium in France. The Frenchman and his
companion had seated themselves at the only vacant table, also it was
in a corner; Pringle, at the next, was the single person within
ear-shot, and the Frenchman's extraordinary behaviour could only be
due to a consuming thirst for privacy. Settling himself in an easy
position, Pringle closed his eyes, and while appearing to resume his
slumber, strained every nerve to discern the lightest word that
passed at the next table. Dressed in the choicest mode of Piccadilly,
the Frenchman bore himself with all the intolerable
self-consciousness of the Boulevardier; but there was no trace of
good-natured levity in the dark aquiline features, and the evil glint
of the eyes recalled visions of an operatic Mephistopheles. His guest
was unmistakably an Englishman of the bank-clerk type, who
contributed his share of the conversation in halting Anglo-French,
punctuated by nervous laughter as, with agonising pains, he dredged
his memory for elusive colloquialisms.</p>

<p>Freely translated, this was what Pringle heard:</p>

<p>'So your people have really decided to take up the submarine,
after all?'</p>

<p>'Yes; I am working out the details of some drawings in
small-scale.'</p>

<p>'But are they from headquarters?'</p>

<p>'Certainly! Duly initialled and passed by the chief
constructor.'</p>

<p>'And you are making&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Full working drawings.'</p>

<p>'There will be no code or other secret about them?'</p>

<p>'What I am doing can be understood by any naval architect.'</p>

<p>'Ah, an English one!'</p>

<p>'The measurements of course, are English, but they are easily
convertible.'</p>

<p>'You could do that?'</p>

<p>'Too dangerous! Suppose a copy in metric scale were found in my
possession! Besides, any draughtsman could reduce them in an hour or
two.'</p>

<p>'And when can you let me have it?'</p>

<p>'In about two weeks.'</p>

<p>'Impossible! I shall not be here.'</p>

<p>'Unless something happens to let me get on with it quickly, I
don't see how I can do it even then. I am never sufficiently free
from interruption to take tracings; there are far too many eyes upon
me. The only chance I have is to spoil the thing as soon as I have
the salient points worked out on it, and after I have pretended to
destroy it, smuggle it home; then I shall have to take elaborate
notes every day and work out the details from them in the evening. It
is simply impossible for me to attempt to take a finished drawing out
of the yard, and, as it is, I don't quite see my way to getting the
spoilt one out&mdash;they look so sharply after spoilt drawings.'</p>

<p>'Two weeks you say, then?'</p>

<p>'Yes; and I shall have to sit up most nights copying the day's
work from my notes to do it.'</p>

<p>'Listen! In a week I must attend at the Ministry of Marine in
Paris, but our military attach&eacute; is my friend. I can trust him;
he shall come down to you.'</p>

<p>'What, at Chatham? Do you wish to ruin me?' A smile from the
Frenchman. 'No; it must be in London, where no one knows me.'</p>

<p>'Admirable! My friend will be better able to meet you.'</p>

<p>'Very well, as soon as I am ready I will telegraph to you.'</p>

<p>'Might not the address of the embassy be remarked by the telegraph
officials? Your English post-office is charmingly unsuspicious, but
we must not risk anything.'</p>

<p>'Ah, perhaps so. Well, I will come up to London and telegraph to
you from here. But your representative&mdash;will he be prepared for
it?'</p>

<p>'I will warn him to expect it in fourteen days.' He made an entry
in his pocket-book. 'How will you sign the message?'</p>

<p>'Gustave Z&eacute;d&eacute;,' suggested the Englishman, sniggering
for the first and only time.</p>

<p>'Too suggestive. Sign yourself "Pauline", and simply add the
time.'</p>

<p>'"Pauline", then. Where shall the rendezvous be?'</p>

<p>'The most public place we can find.'</p>

<p>'Public?'</p>

<p>'Certainly. Some place where everyone will be too much occupied
with his own affairs to notice you. What say you to your Nelson's
Column? There you can wait in a way we shall agree upon.'</p>

<p>'It would be a difficult thing for me to wear a disguise.'</p>

<p>'All disguises are clumsy unless one is an expert. Listen! You
shall be gazing at the statue with one hand in your
breast&mdash;so.'</p>

<p>'Yes; and I might hold a "Baedeker" in my other hand.'</p>

<p>'Admirable, my friend! You have the true spirit of an artist,'
sneered the Frenchman.</p>

<p>'Your representative will advance and say to me, "Pauline", and
the exchange can be made without another word.'</p>

<p>'Exchange?'</p>

<p>'I presume your Government is prepared to pay me handsomely for
the very heavy risks I am running in this matter,' said the
Englishman stiffly.</p>

<p>'Pardon, my friend! How imbecile of me! I am authorised to offer
you ten thousand francs.'</p>

<p>A pause, during which the Englishman made a calculation on the
back of an envelope.</p>

<p>'That is four hundred pounds,' he remarked, tearing the envelope
into carefully minute fragments. 'Far too little for such a
risk.'</p>

<p>'Permit me to remind you, my friend, that you came in search of
me, or rather of those I represent. You have something to sell? Good!
But it is customary for the merchant to display his wares first.'</p>

<p>'I pledge myself to give you copies of the working drawings made
for the use of the artificers themselves. I have already met you
oftener than is prudent. As I say, you offer too little.'</p>

<p>'Should the drawings prove useless to us, we should, of course,
return them to your Admiralty, explaining how they came into our
possession.' There was an unpleasant smile beneath the Frenchman's
waxed moustache as he spoke. 'What sum do you ask?'</p>

<p>'Five hundred pounds in small notes&mdash;say, five pounds
each.'</p>

<p>'That is&mdash;what do you say? Ah, twelve thousand five hundred
francs! Impossible! My limit is twelve thousand.'</p>

<p>To this the Englishman at length gave an ungracious consent, and
after some adroit compliments beneath which the other sought to bury
his implied threat, the pair rose from the table. Either by accident
or design, the Frenchman stumbled over the feet of Pringle, who, with
his long legs stretching out from under the table, his head bowed and
his lips parted, appeared in a profound slumber. Opening his eyes
slowly, he feigned a lifelike yawn, stretched his arms, and gazed
lazily around, to the entire satisfaction of the Frenchman, who, in
the act of parting with his companion, was watching him from the
door.</p>

<p>Calling for some coffee, Pringle lighted a cigarette, and
reflected with a glow of indignant patriotism upon the sordid
transaction he had become privy to. It is seldom that public servants
are in this country found ready to betray their trust&mdash;with all
honour be it recorded of them! But there ever exists the possibility
of some under-paid official succumbing to the temptation at the
command of the less scrupulous representatives of foreign powers,
whose actions in this respect are always ignored officially by their
superiors. To Pringle's somewhat cynical imagination, the sordid
huckstering of a dockyard draughtsman with a French naval
attach&eacute; appealed as corroboration of Walpole's famous
principle, and as he walked homewards to Furnival's Inn, he
determined, if possible, to turn his discovery to the mutual
advantage of his country and himself&mdash;especially the latter.</p>

<p>During the next few days Pringle elaborated a plan of taking up a
residence at Chatham, only to reject it as he had done many previous
ones. Indeed, so many difficulties presented themselves to every
single course of action, that the tenth day after found him strolling
down Bond Street in the morning without having taken any further step
in the matter. With his characteristic fastidious neatness in
personal matters, he was bound for the Piccadilly establishment of
the chief and, for West-Enders, the only firm of hatters in
London.</p>

<p>'Breton Stret, do you noh?' said a voice suddenly. And Pringle,
turning, found himself accosted by a swarthy foreigner.</p>

<p>'Bruton Street, n'est-ce pas?' Pringle suggested.</p>

<p>'Mais oui, Brrruten Stret, monsieur!' was the reply in faint echo
of the English syllables.</p>

<p>'Le voila! a droite,' was Pringle's glib direction. Politely
raising his hat in response to the other's salute, he was about to
resume his walk when he noticed that the Frenchman had been joined by
a companion, who appeared to have been making similar inquiries. The
latter started and uttered a slight exclamation on meeting Pringle's
eye. The recognition was mutual&mdash;it was the French
attach&eacute;! As he hurried down Bond Street, Pringle realised with
acutest annoyance that his deception at the restaurant had been
unavailing, while he must now abandon all hope of a counter-plot for
the honour of his country, to say nothing of his own profit. The
port-wine mark on his right cheek was far too conspicuous for the
attach&eacute; not to recognise him by it, and he regretted his
neglect to remove it as soon as he had decided to follow up the
affair. Forgetful of all beside, he walked on into Piccadilly, and it
was not until he found himself more than half-way back to his
chambers that he remembered the purpose for which he had set out; but
matters of greater moment now claimed his attention, and he
endeavoured by the brisk exercise to work off some of the chagrin
with which he was consumed. Only as he reached the Inn and turned
into the gateway did it occur to him that he had been culpably
careless in thus going straight homeward. What if he had been
followed? Never in his life had he shown such disregard of ordinary
precautions. Glancing back, he just caught a glimpse of a figure
which seemed to whip behind the corner of the gateway. He retraced
his steps and looked out into Holborn. There, in the very act of
retreat, and still but a few feet from the gate, was the
attach&eacute; himself. Cursing the persistence of his own folly,
Pringle dived through the arch again, and determined that the
Frenchman should discover no more that day he turned nimbly to the
left and ran up his own stairway before the pursuer could have time
to re-enter the Inn.</p>

<p>The most galling reflection was his absolute impotence in the
matter. Through lack of the most elementary foresight he had been
fairly run to earth, and could see no way of ridding himself of this
unwelcome attention. To transfer his domicile, to tear himself up by
the roots as it were, was out of the question; and as he glanced
around him, from the soft carpets and luxurious chairs to the warm,
distempered walls with their old prints above the dado of dwarf
bookcases, he felt that the pang of severance from the refined
associations of his chambers would be too acute. Besides, he would
inevitably be tracked elsewhere. He would gain nothing by the
transfer. One thing at least was absolutely certain&mdash;the trouble
which the Frenchman was taking to watch him showed the importance he
attached to Pringle's discovery. But this again only increased his
disgust with the ill-luck which had met him at the very outset. After
all, he had done nothing illegal, however contrary it might be to the
code of ethics, so that if it pleased them the entire French legation
might continue to watch him till the Day of Judgment, and, consoling
himself with this reflection, he philosophically dismissed the matter
from his mind.</p>

<p>It was nearing six when he again left the Inn for Pagani's, the
Great Portland Street restaurant which he much affected; instead of
proceeding due west, he crossed Holborn intending to bear round by
way of the Strand and Regent Street, and so get up an appetite. In
Staple Inn he paused a moment in the further archway. The little
square, always reposeful amid the stress and turmoil of its
environment, seemed doubly so this evening, its eighteenth-century
calm so welcome after the raucous thoroughfare. An approaching
footfall echoed noisily, and as Pringle moved from the shadow of the
narrow wall the newcomer hesitated and stopped, and then made the
circuit of the square, scanning the doorways as if in search of a
name. The action was not unnatural, and twenty-four hours earlier
Pringle would have thought nothing of it, but after the events of the
morning he endowed it with a personal interest, and, walking on, he
ascended the steps into Southampton Buildings and stopped by a
hoarding. As he looked back he was rewarded by the sight of a man
stealthily emerging from the archway and making his way up the steps,
only to halt as he suddenly came abreast of Pringle. Although his
face was unfamiliar, Pringle could only conclude that the man was
following him, and all doubt was removed when, having walked along
the street and turning about at the entrance to Chancery Lane, he saw
the spy had resumed the chase and was now but a few yards back.
Pringle, as a philosopher, felt more inclined to laughter than
resentment at this ludicrous espionage. In a spirit of mischief, he
pursued his way to the Strand at a tortoise-like crawl, halting as if
doubtful of his way at every corner, and staring into every shop
whose lights still invited customers. Once or twice he even doubled
back, and passing quite close to the man, had several opportunities
of examining him. He was quite unobtrusive, even respectable-looking;
there was nothing of the foreigner about him, and Pringle shrewdly
conjectured that the attach&eacute;, wearied of sentry-go had turned
it over to some English servant on whom he could rely.</p>

<p>Thus shepherded, Pringle arrived at the restaurant, from which he
only emerged after a stay maliciously prolonged over each item of the
menu, followed by the smoking of no fewer than three cigars of a
brand specially lauded by the proprietor. With a measure of humanity
diluting his malice, he was about to offer the infallibly exhausted
sentinel some refreshment when he came out, but as the man was
invisible, Pringle started for home, taking much the same route as
before, and calmly debating whether or no the cigars he had just
sampled would be a wise investment; nor until he had reached
Southampton Buildings and the sight of the hoarding recalled the
spy's discomfiture, did he think of looking back to see if he were
still followed. All but the main thoroughfares were by this time
deserted, and although he shot a keen glance up and down Chancery
Lane, now clear of all but the most casual traffic, not a soul was
anywhere near him. By a curious psychological process Pringle felt
inclined to resent the man's absence. He had begun to regard him
almost in the light of a body-guard, the private escort of some
eminent politician. Besides, the whole incident was pregnant with
possibilities appealing to his keenly intellectual sense of humour,
and as he passed the hoarding, he peered into its shadow with the
half-admitted hope that his attendant might be lurking in the depths.
Later on he recalled how, as he glanced upwards, a man's figure
passed like a shadow from a ladder to an upper platform of the
scaffold. The vision, fleeting and unsubstantial, had gone almost
before his retina had received it, but the momentary halt was to
prove his salvation. Even as he turned to walk on, a cataract of
planks, amid scaffold-poles and a chaos of loose bricks, crashed on
the spot he was about to traverse; a stray beam, more erratic in its
descent, caught his hat, and, telescoping it, glanced off his
shoulder, bearing him to the ground, where he lay dazed by the sudden
uproar and half-choked by the cloud of dust. Rapid and disconcerting
as was the event, he remembered afterwards a dim and spectral shape
approaching through the gloom. In a dreamy kind of way he connected
it with that other shadow-figure he had seen high up on the scaffold,
and as it bent over him he recognized the now familiar features of
the spy. But other figures replaced the first, and, when helped to
his feet, he made futile search for it amid the circle of faces
gathered round him. He judged it an hallucination. By the time he had
undergone a tentative dust-down, he was sufficiently collected to
acknowledge the sympathetic congratulations of the crowd and to
decline the homeward escort of a constable.</p>

<p>In the privacy of his chambers, his ideas began to clarify. Events
arranged themselves in logical sequence, and the spectres assumed
more tangible form. A single question dwarfed all others. He asked
himself, 'Was the cataclysm such an accident as it appeared?' And as
he surveyed the battered ruins of his hat, he began to realise how
nearly had he been the victim of a murderous vendetta!</p>

<p>When he arose the next morning, he scarcely needed the dilapidated
hat to remind him of the events of yesterday. Normally a sound and
dreamless sleeper, his rest had been a series of short snatches of
slumber interposed between longer spells of rumination. While he
marvelled at the intensity of malice which he could no longer doubt
pursued him&mdash;a vindictiveness more natural to a mediaeval
Italian state than to this present-day metropolis&mdash;he bitterly
regretted the fatal curiosity which had brought him to such an
extremity. By no means deficient in the grosser forms of physical
courage, his sense that in the game which was being played his
adversaries, as unscrupulous as they were crafty, held all the cards,
and above all, that their espionage effectually prevented him filling
the gaps in the plot which he had as yet only half-discovered, was
especially galling to his active and somewhat neurotic temperament.
Until yesterday he had almost decided to drop the affair of the
Restaurant 'Poissoni&egrave;re' but now, after what he firmly
believed to be a deliberate attempt to assassinate him, he realized
the desperate situation of a duellist with his back to a
wall&mdash;having scarce room to parry, he felt the prick of his
antagonist's rapier deliberately goading him to an incautious thrust.
Was he regarded as the possessor of a dangerous secret? Then it
behoved him to strike, and that without delay.</p>

<p>Now that he was about to attack, a disguise was essential; and
reflecting how lamentably he had failed through the absence of one
hitherto, he removed the port-wine mark from his right cheek with his
customary spirit-lotion, and blackened his fair hair with a few smart
applications of a preparation from his bureau. It was with a
determination to shun any obscure streets or alleys, and especially
all buildings in course of erection, that he started out after his
usual light breakfast. At first he was doubtful whether he was being
followed or not, but after a few experimental turns and doublings he
was unable to single out any regular attendant of his walk; either
his disguise had proved effectual, or his enemies imagined that the
attempt of last night had been less innocent in its results.</p>

<p>Somewhat soothed by this discovery, Pringle had gravitated towards
the Strand and was nearing Charing Cross, when he observed a man
cross from the station to the opposite corner carrying a brown paper
roll. With his thoughts running in the one direction, Pringle in a
flash recognised the dockyard draughtsman. Could he be even now on
his way to keep the appointment at Nelson's Column? Had he been
warned of Pringle's discovery, and so expedited his treacherous task?
And thus reflecting, Pringle determined at all hazards to follow him.
The draughtsman made straight for the telegraph office. It was now
the busiest time of the morning, most of the little desks were
occupied by more or less glib message-writers, and the draughtsman
had found a single vacancy at the far end when Pringle followed him
in and reached over his shoulder to withdraw a form from the rack in
front of him. Grabbing three or four, Pringle neatly spilled them
upon the desk, and with an abject apology hastily gathered them up
together with the form the draughtsman was employed upon. More
apologies, and Pringle, seizing a suddenly vacant desk, affected to
compose a telegram of his own. The draughtsman's message had been
short, and (to Pringle) exceptionally sweet, consisting as it did of
the three words&mdash;'Four-thirty, Pauline'. The address Pringle had
not attempted to read&mdash;he knew that already. The moment the
other left Pringle took up a sheaf of forms, and, as if they had been
the sole reason of his visit, hurried out of the office and took a
hansom back to Furnival's Inn. Here his first care was to fold some
newspapers into a brown-paper parcel resembling the one carried by
the draughtsman as nearly as he remembered it, and having cut a
number of squares of stiff tissue paper, he stuffed an envelope with
them and pondered over a cigarette the most difficult stage of his
campaign. Twice had the draughtsman seen him. Once at the restaurant
in his official guise as the sham literary agent, with smooth face,
fair hair, and the fugitive port-wine mark staining his right cheek;
again that morning, with blackened hair and unblemished face. True,
he might have forgotten the stranger at the restaurant; on the other
hand, he might not&mdash;and Pringle was then (as always) steadfastly
averse to leaving anything to chance.</p>

<p>Besides, in view of this sudden journey to London, it was very
likely that he had received warning of Pringle's discovery. Lastly,
it was more than probable that the spy was still on duty, even though
he had failed to recognise Pringle that morning. The matter was
clinched by a single glance at the Venetian mirror above the mantel,
which reflected a feature he had overlooked&mdash;his now blackened
hair. Nothing remained for him but to assume a disguise which should
impose on both the spy and the draughtsman, and after some thought he
decided to make up as a Frenchman of the South, and to pose as a
servant of the French embassy. Reminiscent of the immortal Tartarin,
his ready bureau furnished him with a stiff black moustache and some
specially stout horsehair to typify the stubbly beard of that hero.
When, at almost a quarter to four, he descended into the Inn with the
parcel in his hand, a Baedeker and the envelope of tissues in his
pocket, a cab was just setting down, and impulsively he chartered it
as far as Exeter Hall. Concealed in the cab, he imagined he would the
more readily escape observation, and by the time he alighted,
flattered himself that any pursuit had been baffled. As he discharged
the cab, however, he noticed a hansom draw up a few paces in the
rear, whilst a man got out and began to saunter westward behind him.
His suspicions alert, although the man was certainly a stranger,
Pringle at once put him to the test by entering Romano's and ordering
a small whisky. After a decent delay, he emerged, and his pulse
quickened when he saw a couple of doors off the same man staring into
a shop window! Pringle walked a few yards back, and then crossed to
the opposite side of the street, but although he dodged at infinite
peril through a string of omnibuses, he was unable to shake off his
satellite, who, with unswerving persistence, occupied the most
limited horizon whenever he looked back.</p>

<p>For almost the first time in his life, Pringle began to despair.
The complacent regard of his own precautions had proved but a fool's
paradise. Despite his elaborate disguise, he must, have been plainly
recognisable to his enemies, and he began to ask himself whether it
was not useless to struggle further. As he paced slowly on, an
indefinable depression stole over him. He thought of the heavy price
so nearly exacted for his interposition. Resentment surged over him
at the memory, and his hand clenched on the parcel. The contact
furnished the very stimulus he required. The instrument of settling
such a score was in his hands, and rejecting his timorous doubts, he
strode on, determined to make one bold and final stroke for
vengeance. The shadows had lengthened appreciably, and the quarter
chiming from near St Martin's warned him that there was no time to
lose&mdash;the spy must be got rid of at any cost. Already could he
see the estuary of the Strand, with the Square widening beyond; on
his right loomed the tunnel of the Lowther Arcade, with its vista of
juvenile delights. The sight was an inspiration. Darting in, he
turned off sharp to the left into an artist's repository, with a
double entrance to the Strand and the Arcade, and, softly closing the
door, peeped through the palettes and frames which hung upon the
glass. Hardly had they ceased swinging to his movement when he had
the satisfaction of seeing the spy, the scent already cold, rush
furiously up the Arcade, his course marked by falling toys and the
cries of the outraged stall-keepers. Turning, Pringle made the
purchase of a sketching-block, the first thing handy, and then passed
through the door which gave on the Strand. At the post-office he
stopped to survey the scene. A single policeman stood by the eastward
base of the column, and the people scattered round seemed but
ordinary wayfarers, but just across the maze of traffic was a
spectacle of intense interest to him. At the quadrant of the Grand
Hotel, patrolling aimlessly in front of the shops, at which he seemed
too perturbed to stare for more than a few seconds at a time, the
draughtsman kept palpitating vigil until the clock should strike the
half-hour of his treason. True to the Frenchman's advice, he sought
safety in a crowd, avoiding the desert of the square until the last
moment.</p>

<p>It wanted two minutes to the half-hour when Pringle opened his
Baedeker, and thrusting one hand into his breast, examined the statue
and coil of rope erected to the glory of our greatest hero.
'Pauline!' said a voice, with the musical inflection unattainable by
any but a Frenchman. Beside him stood a slight, neatly dressed young
man, with close-cropped hair, and a moustache and imperial, who cast
a significant look at the parcel. Pringle immediately held it towards
him, and the dark gentleman producing an envelope from his
breast-pocket, the exchange was effected in silence. With bows and a
raising of hats they parted, while Big Ben boomed on his eight
bells.</p>

<p>The attach&eacute;'s representative had disappeared some minutes
beyond the westernmost lion before the draughtsman appeared from the
opposite direction, his uncertain steps intermitted by frequent halts
and nervous backward glances. With his back to the National Gallery
he produced a Baedeker and commenced to stare up at the monument,
withdrawing his eyes every now and then to cast a shamefaced look to
right and left. In his agitation the draughtsman had omitted the
hand-in-the-breast attitude, and even as Pringle advanced to his side
and murmured 'Pauline', his legs (almost stronger than his will)
seemed to be urging him to a flight from the field of dishonour. With
tremulous eagerness he thrust a brown paper parcel into Pringle's
hands, and, snatching the envelope of tissue slips, rushed across the
road and disappeared in the bar of the Grand Hotel.</p>

<p>Pringle turned to go, but was confronted by a revolver, and as his
eye traversed the barrel and met that of its owner, he recognised the
Frenchman to whom he had just sold the bundle of newspapers. Dodging
the weapon, he tried to spring into the open, but a restraining grip
on each elbow held him in the angle of the plinth, and turning ever
so little Pringle found himself in custody of the man whom he had
last seen in full cry up the Lowther Arcade. No constable was
anywhere near, and even casual passengers walked unheeding by the
nook, so quiet was the progress of this little drama. Lowering his
revolver, the dark gentleman picked up the parcel which had fallen
from Pringle in the struggle. He opened it with delicacy, partially
withdrew some sheets of tracing paper, which he intently examined,
and then placed the whole in an inner pocket, and giving a sign to
the spy to loose his grasp, he spoke for the first time.</p>

<p>'May I suggest, sir,' he said in excellent English with the
slightest foreign accent, 'may I suggest that in future you do not
meddle with what cannot possibly concern you? These documents have
been bought and sold, and although you have been good enough to act
as intermediary in the transaction, I can assure you we were under no
necessity of calling on you for your help.' Here his tone hardened,
and, speaking with less calmness, the accent became more noticeable.
'I discovered your impertinence in selling me a parcel of worthless
papers very shortly after I left you. Had you succeeded in the
attempt you appear to have planned so carefully, it is possible you
might have lived long enough to regret it&mdash;perhaps not! I wish
you good day, sir.' He bowed, as did his companion, and Pringle,
walking on, turned up by the corner of the Union Club.</p>

<p>Dent's clock marked twenty minutes to five, and Pringle reflected
how much had been compressed into the last quarter of an hour. True,
he had not prevented the sale of his country's secrets; on the other
hand&mdash;-he pressed the packet which held the envelope of notes.
Hailing a cab, he was about to step in, when, looking back, at the
nook between the lions he saw a confused movement about the spot. The
two men he had just left were struggling with a third, who,
brandishing a handful of something white, was endeavouring, with
varying success, to plant his fist on divers areas of their persons.
He was the draughtsman. A small crowd, which momentarily increased,
surrounded them, and as Pringle climbed into the hansom two policemen
were seen to penetrate the ring and impartially lay hands upon the
three combatants.</p>
