  <p>Now, with the wars of the world begun, they&rsquo;ll listen to you and me,<br>
    Now, while the frightened nations run to the arms of democracy,<br>
    Now, when our blathering fools are scared, and the years have proved us right&mdash;<br>
    All unprovided and unprepared, the Outpost of the White!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get the people&mdash;no matter how,&rdquo; that is the way they rave,<br>
    Could a million paupers aid us now, or a tinpot squadron save?<br>
    The &ldquo;loyal&rdquo; drivel, the blatant boast are as shames that used
    to be&mdash;<br>
    Our fight shall be a fight for the coast, with the future for the sea!</p>
  <p>We must turn our face to the only track that will take us through the worst&mdash;<br>
    Cable to charter that we lack, guns and cartridges first,<br>
    New machines that will make machines till our factories are complete&mdash;<br>
    Block the shoddy and Brummagem, pay them with wool and wheat.</p>
  <p>Build to-morrow the foundry shed (&rsquo;tis a task we dare not shirk)<br>
    Lay the runs and the engine-bed, and get the gear to work,<br>
    Have no fear when we raise the steam in the hurried factory&mdash;<br>
    We are not lacking in the brains that teem with originality.</p>
  <p>Have no fear, for the way is clear&mdash;we&rsquo;ll shackle the hands of
    greed<br>
    Every lad is an engineer in his country&rsquo;s hour of need&mdash;<br>
    Many are brilliant, swift to learn, quick at invention too,<br>
    Born inventors whose young hearts burn to show what the South can do!</p>
  <p>To show what the South can do, done well, and more than the North can do.<br>
    They&rsquo;ll make us the cartridge and make the shell, and the gun to carry
    true,<br>
    Give us the gear and the South is strong&mdash;the docks shall yield us more;<br>
    The national arm like the national song comes with the first great war.</p>
  <p>Books of science from every land, volumes on gunnery,<br>
    Practical teachers we have at hand, masters of chemistry,<br>
    Clear young heads that will sift and think in spite of authorities,<br>
    And brains that shall leap from invention&rsquo;s brink at the clash of factories.<br>
    Still be noble in peace or war, raise the national spirit high;<br>
    And this be our watchword for evermore:&mdash;&ldquo;For Australia&mdash;till
    we die&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheDayBeforeIDie"></a>The Day Before I Die</b></h2>
  <p>There&rsquo;s&nbsp;such a lot of work to do, for such a troubled head!<br>
    I&rsquo;m scribbling this against a book, with foolscap round, in bed.<br>
    It strikes me that I&rsquo;ll scribble much in this way by and by,<br>
    And write my last lines so perchance the day before I die.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s lots of things to come and go, and I, in careless rhyme,<br>
    And drink and love (it wastes the most) have wasted lots of time.<br>
    There&rsquo;s so much good work to be done it makes me sure that I<br>
    Will be the sorriest for my death, the day before I die.</p>
  <p>But, lift me dear, for I am tired, and let me taste the wine&mdash;<br>
    And lay your cheek a little while on this lined cheek of mine.<br>
    I want to say I love you so&mdash;your patient love is why<br>
    I&rsquo;ll have such little time, you know, the day before I die.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheSpiritsofOurFathers"></a>The Spirits of Our Fathers</b></h2>
  <p>The spirits&nbsp;of our fathers rise not from every wave,<br>
    They left the sea behind them long ago;<br>
    It was many years of &ldquo;slogging,&rdquo; where strong men must be brave,<br>
    For the sake of unborn children, and, maybe, a soul to save,<br>
    And the end a tidy homestead, and four panels round a grave,<br>
    And&mdash;the bones of poor old Someone down below.</p>
  <p>Some left happy homes in old lands when they heard the New Land call<br>
    (Some were gentlemen and some were social wrecks)<br>
    Some left squalor and starvation&mdash;they were soldiers one and all,<br>
    And their weapons were the cross-cut and the wedges and the maul.<br>
    (How we used to run as children when we heard the big trees fall!<br>
    While they paused to wipe their faces and their necks.)</p>
  <p>They were buried by our uncles where the ground was hard to dig<br>
    (It was little need for churchmen that they had),<br>
    And they sobbed like grown-up children, for their hearts were soft and big.<br>
    And the myrtle and the ivy, and the vine-tree and the fig&mdash;<br>
    And the heather&mdash;and the shamrock, where th&rsquo; mother kept the pig,<br>
    Waited vainly for the Grand Australian Dad.</p>
  <p>The spirits of our fathers have belts and bowyangs on<br>
    (Oh, Father! do you live again and know?)<br>
    Strapped riding pants and leggings parched and perished in the sun,<br>
    And love-belts &ldquo;worked&rdquo; by sweethearts ere the digging days were
    done,<br>
    And the cabbage-tree that went out with the muzzle-loading gun<br>
    That was carried round the cattle out beyond the furthest run<br>
    Where the brave exploring drovers used to go.</p>
  <p>The spirits of our fathers, they rise from every grave<br>
    (Each side the line that Burke and Leichhardt crossed),<br>
    And where still in &ldquo;settled districts&rdquo; ghastly Bush-lost madmen
    rave<br>
    (While the grim search parties, haggard, struggle hopelessly to save)<br>
    Till the spirit timber beacons and the spirit waters lave,<br>
    And no spirit of a father has been lost.</p>
  <p>The spirits of our fathers, they rise from level sand<br>
    (Like an ocean where an ocean used to be),<br>
    Out where Heaven&rsquo;s grandest &rsquo;lectrics light the Never Never Land<br>
    With the glorious hope and promise that the Bushmen understand<br>
    When the rain and grass are coming till the desert-plain is grand,<br>
    And the drought-divorced Australian meets his soul.</p>
  <p>Listen! There&rsquo;s the word that&rsquo;s spoken when no other soul seems
    near,<br>
    And the one who hears is sober, calm and sane,<br>
    And the name called, amongst many, when the called alone can hear&mdash;<br>
    Words by lone huts and in prison, speaking comfort, hope and cheer&mdash;<br>
    And the Warning, not admited to each other, calm and clear&mdash;<br>
    Then the fathers of a nation speak again.</p>
  <p>There are spirits of our fathers in the theatres to-night<br>
    (And the places where rich sons of settlers go),<br>
    And a half-dressed daughter shivers, and a tailored son turns white,<br>
    For the heritage world-squandered, and the Land put out of sight,<br>
    And that awful thirst for Nothing that they bought with their birthright<br>
    And a haggard mother&rsquo;s spirit bending low.</p>
  <p>There are spirits of our fathers by the pleasant South Coast roads<br>
    Where motor cars of sons of stockmen go,<br>
    In the wealth robbed from Up Country, oh, the shame of it is black!<br>
    And the laugh and giggle ceases and the car swerves and turns back,<br>
  &rsquo;Tis the old dad, smiling grimly, with arms folded by the track,<br>
    And the shades of horse and swagmen that they know.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s the flagship of the First Fleet rising grimly on the tide<br>
    (Out by Watson where the motor, launches go),<br>
    And the features known to many of our families of pride&mdash;<br>
    But the launches veer like seabirds, veer and turn and circle wide<br>
    From the shadow of a free ship where the waiting liners ride<br>
    And pale faces of brave emigrants look sadly o&rsquo;er the side&mdash;<br>
    Boys and girls who were our parents long ago.</p>
  <p>There the word said in the Senate by the patriot unafraid<br>
    (Senate where the comic fatmen never mind)<br>
    And the tissue starts and wakens, summons &ldquo;Haw-haws!&rdquo; to its
    aid,<br>
    But the honest men sit upright who were wearied of tirade.<br>
    And a nation&rsquo;s aims are furthered! and a nation&rsquo;s law is made&mdash;<br>
    For the spirit of a father stands behind.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ForAlltheLandtoSee"></a>For All the Land to See</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note"><i>(A Song of the Tools)</i></p>
  <p>The cross-cut&nbsp;and the crowbar cross, and hang them on the wall,<br>
    And make a greenhide rack to fit the wedges and the maul,<br>
    The &ldquo;done&rdquo; long-handled shovel and the thong-bound axe that fell,<br>
    The crowbar, pick-axe and the &ldquo;throw&rdquo;&mdash;the axe that morticed
    well.<br>
    The old patched tent and &ldquo;fly&rdquo;, bag bunk and pillow of sugee,<br>
    The frying-pan and billy-can, for all the land to see.</p>
  <p>The cross-cut, after pounds of files, is narrowed down and thin,<br>
    With here and there a tooth cut out as th&rsquo; curve straightened in,<br>
    The axe close to the iron ground, the shovel to the shaft,<br>
    The handle from the first worn smooth with sweat and dust and graft.<br>
    The maul and wedges burred and split, spell bravest history&mdash;<br>
    These were the arms our fathers bore, for none but they to see.</p>
  <p>Then look you round on all that is, on cities proud and fair,<br>
    And look you westward from the range&mdash;towns, farms and homesteads there.<br>
    Then hurry to a place you know lest you should be too late,<br>
    And clear the scrub some little space&mdash;small place, say&mdash;three-by
    eight.<br>
    A blackened post stump stands where four rough panels used to be<br>
    And there take off your panama where none but God might see.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="OurMistressandOurQueen"></a>Our Mistress and Our Queen</b></h2>
  <p>We set&nbsp;no right above hers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No earthly light nor star,<br>
    She hath had many lovers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not as lovers are:<br>
    They all were gallant fellows<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And died all deaths for her,<br>
    And never one was jealous<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But comrades true they were.</p>
  <p>Oh! each one is a brother,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though all the lands they claim&mdash;<br>
    For her or for each other<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;ve died all deaths the same<br>
    Young, handsome, old and ugly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free, married or divorced,<br>
    Where springtime bard or Thug lie<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her lover&rsquo;s feet have crossed.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Mid buttercups and daisies<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fair girls by their side,<br>
    Young poets sang her praises<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While day in starlight died.<br>
    In smoke and fire and dust, and<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With red eyes maniac like,<br>
    Those same young poets thrust and&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrenched out the reeking pike!</p>
  <p>She is as old as ages,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she is ever young.<br>
    Upon her birthday pages<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;ve writ in every tongue;<br>
    Her charms have never vanished<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor beauty been defiled,<br>
    Her lovers ne&rsquo;er were banished&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can never be exiled.</p>
  <p>Ah! thousands died who kissed her,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But millions died who scorned<br>
    Our Sweetheart, Queen and Sister,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom slaves and C&aelig;sars spurned!<br>
    And thousands lost her for her<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Own sweet sake, and the world,<br>
    Her first most dread adorer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Heaven&rsquo;s high state was hurled.</p>
  <p>No sign of power she beareth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence doth she tread,<br>
    But evermore she weareth<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cap of red rose red.<br>
    Her hair is like the raven,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her soul is like the sea,<br>
    Her blue eyes are a haven<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That watch Eternity.</p>
  <p>She claimed her right from Heaven,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She claims her right from earth,<br>
    She claimed it hell-ward driven,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before her second birth.<br>
    No real man lives without her,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No real man-child thrives,<br>
    Sweet sin may cling about her,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But purity survives.</p>
  <p>She claims the careless girl, and<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She claims the master mind;<br>
    She whispers to the Earl, and<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She whispers to the hind!<br>
    No ruler knoweth which man<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sword for her might draw;<br>
    Her whisper wakes the rich man&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peasant on his straw.</p>
  <p>She calls us from the prison,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She calls us from the plain,<br>
    To towns where men have risen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, again, again!<br>
    She calls us from our pleasures,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She calls us from our cares,<br>
    She calls us from our treasures,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She calls us from our prayers.</p>
  <p>From seas and oceans over<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our long-lost sons she draws,<br>
    She calls the careless rover,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She calls us from our wars.<br>
    The hermit she discovers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lead her bravest brave&mdash;&mdash;<br>
    The spirit of dead lovers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She calls them from the grave!</p>
  <p>We leave the squalid alley,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our women and our vice,<br>
    We leave the pleasant valley,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life-lust or sacrifice.<br>
    The gold hunt in the mountains,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power-lust on the sea,<br>
    The land-lust by earth&rsquo;s fountains,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defeat or victory.</p>
  <p>No means of peace discover<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her strength on &ldquo;Nights Before&rdquo;,<br>
    She has her secret lover<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That guards the Grand Duke&rsquo;s door.<br>
    No power can resist hers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No massacre deter&mdash;<br>
    Small brothers and wee sisters<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of lovers, watch for her!</p>
  <p>Old dotards undetected,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School boys that never tire,<br>
    And lone hags unsuspected<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That drone beside the fire.<br>
    The youth in love&rsquo;s first passion,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl in day-dream mood,<br>
    And, in the height of fashion,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &ldquo;butterfly&rdquo; and &ldquo;dude&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>The millionaire heart-broken,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beggar with his whine,<br>
    And each one hath a token,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And each one hath a sign.<br>

  <p>Oh, bloody our revivals!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swift our vengeance hurled,<br>
    We&rsquo;ve laid our dear-loved rivals<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In trenches round the world!<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health, wealth, and life&rsquo;s grand whole,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A passion of our soul.</p>
  <p>Her lovers fought on ice fields<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And starve in palaces.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With heads and scythe-blades low,<br>
    Through fir and pine clump spattered,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like ink blots on the snow.<br>
    With broken limbs and shattered<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;ve crushed like hunted brute,<br>
    And died in hellish torture<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In holes beneath the roof.</p>
  <p>They&rsquo;ve coursed through streets of cities<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fleeing Parliaments,<br>
    And songs that were not ditties<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreadful carmagnole.</p>
  <p>By mountains, and by stations,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out where wide levels are,<br>
    They&rsquo;ve baulked the march of nations<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ridden lone and far.<br>
    The whip stroke of the bullet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short grunt of distress&mdash;<br>
    The saddled pony grazing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone and riderless.</p>
  <p>The plain in sunlight blazing&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No signal of distress,<br>
    Unseen by far scouts gazing,<br>
    And still, with wide eyes glazing:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead lover of our mistress,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead comrade of his rivals,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead champion of his country,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead soldier of his widow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And of his fatherless.</p>
  <p>She pauses by her writers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whispers, through the years,<br>
    The poems that delight us<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bring the glorious tears.<br>
    The song goes on unbroken<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through worlds of senseless drones,<br>
    Until the words are spoken<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Emperors on their thrones.</p>

  <p>The brown eyes&nbsp;came from Asia, where all mystery is true,<br>
    Ere the masters of Soul Secrets dreamed of hazel, grey, and blue;<br>
    And the Brown Eyes came to Egypt, which is called the gypsies&rsquo; home,<br>
    And the Brown Eyes went from Egypt and Jerusalem to Rome.</p>
  <p>There was strife amongst the Brown Eyes for the false things and the true;<br>
    There was war amongst the Brown Eyes for the old gods and the new;<br>
    But the old gods live for ever, and their goddesses are bright<br>
    In the temples of Old Passions with the Brown Eyes of the White.</p>
  <p>The Brown Eyes east, by Africa, they saw and conquered Spain,<br>
    And the Brown Eyes marched as Christians till a Brown Eye met a Dane,<br>
    The Dane had Brown-Eyed children who in blue eyes took delight&mdash;<br>
    And a son of blue-eyed sailors, brown-eyed, reads the stars to-night.</p>
  <p>Oh, Knowledge from Old Deserts, where the great stars rocked the world!<br>
    Oh, courage from grim seaboards, where the Viking ships were hurled!<br>
    The clear skin of the Norseman, and the desert strength and sight,<br>
    The power to fathom mankind, and the glorious gift to write!</p>
  <p>We can look in souls of women, aye! and let them know we do;<br>
    We can fix the false eyes earthward; we can meet and match the true;<br>
    We can startle Voice from Silence, and from Darkness flash the Light&mdash;<br>
    And the eyes to fathom Asia are the Brown Eyes of the White.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a legend in the nations that all Brown Eyes once were true,<br>
    But were taught in love and warfare by the sinful shades of blue;<br>
    There&rsquo;s a story amongst sinners that all Brown Eyes once were kind,<br>
    Till the Steel-Blue struck the Red-Fire in a hatred that was blind.</p>
  <p>But the Brown Eyes are the saddest at the death of Love and Truth.<br>
    And the Brown Eyes are the grandest and the dreamiest of Youth.<br>
    They have risen in rebellion unto leadership sublime&mdash;<br>
    And the grey-eyed queens of women loved, and love them for all time!</p>
  <p>Brown Eyes never married Brown Eyes but unhappiness held sway,<br>
    For the real mates of the Brown Eyes have for ever been the grey.<br>
    But though Brown Eyes quarrel hotly, though their very souls be wrenched,<br>
    Never Blue-Eye wronged a Brown-Eye but the Brown-Eye was avenged!</p>
  <p>Through the breadth of wide Australia, waiting desert-like and vast,<br>
    We have sent our Brown-Eyed children, who are multiplying fast.<br>
    Patriots, picture-writers, sages, fill the Brown-Eyed rolls to-night&mdash;<br>

    We wore them to the Queen&rsquo;s Hall, while England yelled &ldquo;Pro-Boers!&rdquo;<br>
And sat them over victory while London banged the doors.</p>
  <p>We wore them from Port Arthur round till all sunk in the sea&mdash;<br>
    (Who&rsquo;ll wear the white man&rsquo;s colours, and wear them home with
    me?)<br>

    Who&rsquo;ll wear the beaten colours, boys, and wear them on his own?</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s one would look with startled eyes and shrink while I caressed,<br>
    Came I not with the colours of the conquered on my breast.<br>
    And twenty thousand Bushmen would stand with hands behind<br>
    And scorn in all their faces for the coward of his kind.</p>

  <p>The teens were black and bitter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A smothered boyhood&rsquo;s grave&mdash;<br>
    A farm-drudge in the drought-time,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A weary workshop slave.<br>
    But twenty years have laid them,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the world is fair&mdash;<br>

  <p>The twenties they were noble,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bravest years, I think;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas man to man in trouble,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In working and in drink;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas man to man in fighting,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For money or for praise.<br>
    And we&rsquo;ll find in the Forties<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some more Bohemian days.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;re good for ten years
  more.</p>
  <p>The thirties were the fate years;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fought behind the scenes.<br>
    The thirties were more cruel<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blacker than the teens;<br>
    I held them not but bore them&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were no years of mine;<br>
    But they are going from me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I am thirty-nine.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here&rsquo;s the stronger

    Who, because of the deer-parks and game-runs where her wheat-fields and pastures

    In the corner&mdash;not a vision&mdash;but a sign for coming days,<br>
    Stand a box of ammunition and a rifle in green baize.<br>
    And in this, the living present, let the word go through the land,<br>
    Every tradesman, clerk and peasant should have these two things at hand.</p>
  <p>No&mdash;no ranting song is needed, and no meeting, flag or fuss<br>
    In the future, still unheeded, shall the spirit come to us!<br>
    Without feathers, drum or riot, on the day that is to be,<br>
    We shall march down, very quiet, to our stations by the sea.<br>
    While the bitter parties stifle every voice that warns of war,<br>
    Every man should own a rifle and have cartridges in store!</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="WhatHaveWeAllForgotten"></a>What Have We All Forgotten?</b></h2>
  <p>What&nbsp;have we all forgotten, at the break of the seventh year?<br>
    With a nation born to the ages and a Bad Time borne on its bier!<br>
    Public robbing, and lying that death cannot erase&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Private&rdquo; strife and deception&mdash;Cover the bad dead face!<br>
    Drinking, gambling and madness&mdash;Cover and bear it away&mdash;<br>
    But what have we all forgotten at the dawn of the seventh day?</p>
  <p>These are the years of plenty&mdash;years when the &ldquo;tanks&rdquo; are
    full&mdash;<br>
    Stacked by the lonely sidings mountains of wheat and wool.<br>
    Country crowds to the city, healthy, shaven and dressed,<br>
    Clothes to wear with the gayest, money to spend with the best.<br>
    Grand are the lights of the cities, carnival kings in power&mdash;<br>
    But what have we all forgotten, in this, the eleventh hour?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rdquo; have brought the states together, a land to the lands new
    born.<br>
    We have worked in the glorious weather, we have garnered and reaped and shorn.<br>
    We have come from the grass-waves flowing under Heaven&rsquo;s electric lamps<br>
    (Making of sordid cities, boyish and jovial camps).<br>
  &ldquo;We&rdquo; have cleansed the cities and townships: we rest and frolic
  and gain,<br>
    But what have we all forgotten? Did we send the peace and the rain?</p>
  <p>What have we all forgotten, here in our glorious home?<br>
    (I the greater the sinner because I was greater than some.)<br>
    What have we all forgotten so widely from east to west?<br>
    (I&mdash;and the most ungrateful because I was doubly blessed.)<br>
    Sinners to self and to country! and saviours though misunderstood!<br>
    Let us all kneel for one moment and thank the Great Spirits for Good.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="SincetheCitiesaretheCities"></a>Since the Cities are the Cities</b></h2>
  <p>Fools&nbsp;can parrot-cry the prophet when the proof is close at hand,<br>
    And the blind can see the danger when the foe is in the land!<br>
    Truth was never cynicism, death or ruin&rsquo;s not a joke,<br>
  &ldquo;Told-you-so&rdquo; is not a warning&mdash;Patriotism not a croak.</p>
  <p>Blame will aid no man nor country when the dark days come at last&mdash;<br>
    As with men so with a nation, and the warning time is past.<br>
    Our great sins were of omission, and the dogs of war are loosed&mdash;<br>
    And we all must stand together when those sins come home to roost.</p>
  <p>Since the cities are the cities and shall stand for evermore,<br>
    Let us justify our being, be it peace or be it war.<br>
    For because we are the townsfolk, and have never ridden far<br>
    Shall we call the bush to aid us that has made us what we are?</p>
  <p>Westward went our brothers, fighting distance, drought, and loneliness<br>
    While we lived in light and comfort knowing nothing of distress,<br>
    We who never shared the hardships when the sunset led them on,<br>
    Now&rsquo;s our time, O street-bred people, with our faces to the dawn!</p>
  <p>They have conquered with the cross-cut and the wedges and the maul,<br>
    With the spade and axe and mattock and the saddle-packs and all,<br>
    They have mighty work before them for the sake of you and me&mdash;<br>
    Let us stand up to our duty! We&rsquo;re the Rearguard by the Sea.</p>
  <p>Days of gibes at &ldquo;street-bred people&rdquo; by the street-bred bards
    are done&mdash;<br>
    Shall the man who lays the yard-stick never learn to lay the gun?<br>
    Shall the crouched type-writer toiling for his home in days like these<br>
    Touch the button the less firmly when we play on other keys?</p>
  <p>We have seen in many countries what the street-bred men can do&mdash;<br>
    In the desert, scrub and jungle they were men who battled through!<br>
    Human weeds of grand endurance winning where the strong men quailed,<br>
    Pigeon-chested leaders leading on where beef-born courage failed.</p>
  <p>Street-bred people down the ages&mdash;beggars, mobs and democrats&mdash;<br>
    Fought through many desperate sieges (fought on horseflesh, dogs and rats)<br>
    When their own cowed country failed them, then the city soul was proved&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Street-bred people&rdquo; died in thousands for the cities that they
  loved.</p>
  <p>In the days when strength was needed&mdash;days of pike and axe and sword&mdash;<br>
    Daylight found the peaceful burghers ready, keeping watch and ward.<br>
    Clerks and tailors fought like heroes at the gates and in the trench&mdash;<br>
    (Even Falstaff brought his herrings with some slaughter through the French).</p>
  <p>Every man should have a cottage and a garden to defend,<br>
    But the &ldquo;should-be&rdquo; is for ever&mdash;cities stand until the
    end,<br>
    Every farmer has a country that he loves when war-drums roll&mdash;<br>
    Every clerk may have a city that he loves with heart and soul.</p>
  <p>Fat or lean, we all are sinners&mdash;lean or fat we all would be;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I well might say a word:<br>
    The day and work is nearly done,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ours the victory,<br>
    And we are resting, one by one,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In graveyards by the sea.</p>
  <p>But then you talked of other nights,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, gay from dusk to dawn,<br>
    You wasted hours with other lights<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That went where you have gone.<br>
    You spoke not of the fair and &ldquo;fast&rdquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But of the pure and true&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Sweet ugly women of the past&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who stood so well by you.</p>
  <p>You made a jest on that last night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met it with a laugh:<br>
    You wondered which of us should write<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other&rsquo;s epitaph.<br>
    We filled the glasses to the brim&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The land&rsquo;s own wine&rdquo; you know&mdash;<br>
    And solemnly we drank to him<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who should be first to go.</p>
  <p>No ribald jest; we were but two&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The royst&rsquo;ring days were past&mdash;<br>
    And in our heart of hearts we knew,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That one was going fast.<br>
    We both knew who should win the race&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were rest or fame the prize&mdash;<br>
    As with a quaint smile on your face<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You looked into my eyes.</p>
  <p>You talked about old struggles brave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in a saddened tone&mdash;<br>
    The swindles editors forgave<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For laughter&rsquo;s sake alone.<br>
    You talked of humorous distress,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bailiffs that you knew,<br>
    But with a touch of bitterness<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d never seen in you.</p>
  <p>No need for tears or quick-caught breath&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You sleep not in the sand&mdash;<br>
    No need for ranting song of death,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the death drink in our hand.<br>
    No need for vain invective hurled<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At &ldquo;cruel destiny&rdquo;,<br>
    Though you seem dead to all the world<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not dead to me.</p>
  <p>I see you walk into the room&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We aye remember how&mdash;<br>
    And, looking back into the gloom,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll smile about it now.<br>
  &rsquo;Twas Victor&rsquo;s entry, solemn style&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With verse or paragraph:<br>
    Though we so often saw your smile<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many heard you laugh?</p>
  <p>They dare to write about the man<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they have never seen:<br>
    The blustering false Bohemian<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you have never been;<br>
    Some with the false note in their voice,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the false tear shed,<br>
    Who in their secret heart rejoice<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one more rival&mdash;dead.</p>
  <p>They miss the poems, real and true,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where your heart&rsquo;s blood was shed.<br>
    And rave of reckless things that you<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw out for bitter bread.<br>
    They &ldquo;weep&rdquo; and &ldquo;worship&rdquo; while you &ldquo;rest&rdquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They drivel and they dote&mdash;<br>
    But, Victor, we remember best<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things we never wrote.</p>
  <p>The things that lie between us two,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things I&rsquo;ll never tell.<br>
    A fool, I stripped my soul, but you&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You wore your mask too well<br>
    (How strangely human all men be,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though each one plays a part).<br>
    You only dropped it once for me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then I saw your heart.</p>
  <p>A souls&rsquo;-match, such as one might strike<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With or without intent<br>
    (How strangely all men are alike&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With masks so different).<br>
    No need to drop the mask again,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that last night, I know&mdash;<br>
    It chanced when we were sober men,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some seven years ago.</p>
  <p>They slander you, fresh in the sand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They slander me alive;<br>
    But, when their foul souls flee the land,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our spirits shall arrive.<br>
    In slime and envy let them rave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let the worst be said:<br>
  &ldquo;A drunkard at a drunkard&rsquo;s grave,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A brilliant drunkard dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Because we would not crawl to them,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their hands we would not shake,<br>
    Because their greed we would condemn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their bribes we would not take:<br>
    Because unto the fair and true<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hearts and songs we gave&mdash;<br>
    But I forgot them when I threw<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My white flower on your grave.</p>
  <p>So let us turn, and with a smile<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let those poor creatures pass<br>
    While we, the few who wait awhile,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drink to an empty glass.<br>
    We&rsquo;ll live as in the days gone by,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To no god shall we bow&mdash;<br>
    Though, Victor, there are times when I<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel jealous of you now.</p>
  <p>But I&rsquo;ll have done with solemn songs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save for my country&rsquo;s sake;<br>
    It is not meet, for all the wrongs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That any heart should break.<br>
    So many need to weep and smile,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though all the rest should frown,<br>
    That I&rsquo;d take your burden up awhile<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you have laid it down.</p>

  <p>The camp&nbsp;of high-class spielers,<br>

    And doo-dah dilettante,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scornful &ldquo;venuses&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
    House agents, and storekeepers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All eager they to &ldquo;bleed&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
    The bards who tackled Manly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were plucky bards indeed!</p>
  <p>With shops that feared to trust them,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pubs that looked askance;<br>
    And prigs who read their verses,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But gave them not a glance;&mdash;<br>
    When all were vain and selfish,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And editors were hard&mdash;<br>
    The bard that stuck to Manly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was sure a mighty bard.</p>
  <p>What mattered floors were barren,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And windows curtainless,<br>
    And our life seemed to others<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But blackguard recklessness?<br>
    We wore our clothes for comfort,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We earned our bread alway,<br>
    And beer and good tobacco<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came somehow every day.</p>
  <p>Came kindred souls to Manly&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outsiders that we knew,<br>
    And with them scribes and artists,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And low comedians too;<br>
    And sometimes bright girl writers&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called &ldquo;Tommy&rdquo;, &ldquo;Jack&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Pat&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
    (Though each one had a sweetheart<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest knew nought of that).</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas not the paltry village<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We honoured unaware,<br>
    Or welcome warm, or friendship,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or &ldquo;tone&rdquo; that took us there;<br>
    We longed to sing for mankind,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where heaven&rsquo;s breath was free<br>
    We only sought the grandeur<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sea-cliff, sands and sea.</p>
  <p>And we were glad at Manly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unaware of &ldquo;swells&rdquo;,<br>
    Of doctors and of nurses,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And private hospitals;<br>
    With little fear of bailiffs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And great contempt for greed&mdash;<br>
    The bards who lived at Manly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were a healthy breed.</p>
  <p>Oh! moonlit nights at Manly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the world was fair!<br>
    In shirts and turned-up trousers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We larked like big boys there.<br>
    Oh! glorious autumn mornings&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold and green and blue&mdash;<br>
    We &ldquo;stripped&rdquo; as well as any,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swam as strongly too.</p>
  <p>The artist had a missus,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who rather loved the wretch,<br>
    And so for days together<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;d stay at home and sketch.<br>
    And then&mdash;I fear &rsquo;twas only<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When things were getting tight&mdash;<br>
    The bards would shun each other,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hump themselves&mdash;and write.</p>
  <p>When bailiffs came to Manly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;d find no &ldquo;sticks&rdquo; to take,<br>
    We&rsquo;d welcome them as brothers&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their grimy hands we&rsquo;d shake;<br>
    We&rsquo;d send for beer in billies&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And straightway send for more&mdash;<br>
    And bailiff nights in Manly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were merry nights of yore.</p>
  <p>There are some things that landlords<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And law can&rsquo;t do at all:<br>
    They could not take the pictures<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We painted on the wall;<br>
    They could not take the table&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table was a door;<br>
    They could not take the bedsteads&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beds were on the floor.</p>
  <p>The door of some old stable&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;d borrowed for a drink&mdash;<br>
    A page of rhymes and sketches,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stained with beer and ink;<br>
    A dead hand drew the portraits&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, say, should I be shamed,<br>
    To seek it out in Manly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And get the old door framed?</p>
  <p>They left the masterpieces<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artist dreamed of long;<br>
    They could not take the gardens<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From&nbsp;Victor Daley&rsquo;s&nbsp;song;<br>
    They left his summer islands<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fairy ships at sea,<br>
    They could not take my mountains<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And western plains from me.</p>
  <p>One bailiff was our brother,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No better and no worse&mdash;<br>
    And, oh! the yarns he told us<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put in prose and verse,<br>
    And sorry we to lose him,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sorry he to go&mdash;<br>
    (Oh! skeletons of Pott&rsquo;s Point,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many things we know)!</p>
  <p>The very prince of laughter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With brains and sympathy;<br>
    And with us on the last night<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent his bailiff&rsquo;s fee.<br>
    He banished Durkin&rsquo;s gruffness,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He set my soul afloat,<br>
    And drew till day on Daley&rsquo;s<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright store of anecdote.</p>
  <p>He said he&rsquo;d stick to business&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he could well be free&mdash;<br>
    If but to save poor devils<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From harder &ldquo;bums&rdquo; than he,<br>
    Now artist, bard and bailiff<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have left this vale of sin&mdash;<br>
    I trust, if they reach Heaven,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;ll take that bailiff in.</p>
  <p>The bards that lived in Manly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have vanished one and one;<br>
    But do not think in Manly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bohemian days are done.<br>
    They bled me white in Manly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When rich and tempest-tossed&mdash;<br>
    I&rsquo;ll leave some bills in Manly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pay for what I lost.</p>
  <p>They&rsquo;d grab and grind in Manly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then slander, sneer, and flout.<br>
    The shocked of moral Manly!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They starved my brothers out.<br>
    The miserable village,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set in a scene so fair,<br>
    Were honester and cleaner<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If some of us were there!</p>
  <p>But one went with December&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These last lines seem to-night<br>
    Like some song I remember,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not a song I write.<br>
    With vision strangely clearer<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My old chums seem to be,<br>
    In death and absence, nearer<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than e&rsquo;er they were to me.</p>
  <p>Alone, and still not lonely&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When tears will not be shed&mdash;<br>
    I wish that I could only<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe that they were dead.<br>
    With hardly curbed emotion,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t but think, somehow,<br>
    In Manly by the ocean<br>

    I was true when the iron had bitten<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep into my soul in the night;<br>
    I wrote not for praise nor for money,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I craved but the soul and the pen,<br>
    And I felt not the sting in the honey<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of writing the kindness of men.</p>
  <p>You read and you saw without seeing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My work seemed a trifle apart,<br>
    While the truth of things thrilled through my being,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wrong of things murdered my heart!<br>
    Cast out, and despised and neglected,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weak, and in fear, and in debt,<br>

  <p>My&nbsp;father-in-law is a careworn man,<br>

    But he summons a smile as well as he can<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever he meets with me.<br>
    The sign we make with a silent shake<br>

    Our pints they fill, and we say, &ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo;<br>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="JohnsonsWonder"></a>Johnson&rsquo;s Wonder</b></h2>
  <p>I&rsquo;d&nbsp;been right round by overlands to see the world and life,<br>
    And on the boat at Plymouth I met Johnson and his wife;<br>
    He was a man who knew the world and wore the know-all smile&mdash;<br>
    His wife a silly pussy cat&mdash;the soft, obedient style.<br>
    His constant source of comfort was his life was all serene,<br>
    His ceaseless source of wonder was that &ldquo;men could be so green&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>There were two women of the world whom Johnson knew by sight,<br>
    The one as fair as Southern dawn; the other dark as night&mdash;<br>
    They played each other off you see, as many sisters do&mdash;<br>
    They travelled with their &ldquo;uncle dear&rdquo; (their &ldquo;manager&rdquo;&mdash;a
    Jew);<br>
    To us the make-up and the game was plainly to be seen,<br>
    And Johnson wondered how on earth most men could be so green.</p>
  <p>At Naples, as at Genoa, too, they left no room for doubt;<br>
    They took down the chief officer and cleared the captain out.<br>
    We saw it as outsiders do&mdash;those seamen looked so mad&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas managed so that neither knew the other had been had.<br>
    Such games are known to all who sail for gain or change of scene,<br>
    And Johnson wondered how in air such men could be so green.</p>
  <p>You know Port Said, by Suez Lane, and no doubt you&rsquo;re aware<br>
    What sort of carnivals are held ashore on Sunday there.<br>
    And &ldquo;Uncle&rdquo;, being far from well, and voting ports a bore,<br>
    The doctor and a Johnnie took the lovely pair ashore.<br>
    They had a glorious donkey ride (you know which pair I mean),<br>
    And Johnson wondered how the deuce an ass could be so green.</p>
  <p>There was a third-class passenger who acted like an earl,<br>
    Spent something over thirty pounds upon a Southern girl.<br>
    They&rsquo;d met aboard, and soon the news went round from mouth to mouth,<br>
    They were engaged to marry when they reached the Sunny South.<br>
    She chucked him at Fremantle, and she didn&rsquo;t think it mean,<br>
    And Johnson wondered how in life a boy could be so green.</p>
  <p>There was another married pair whom Johnson did despise;<br>
    She carried on most scand&rsquo;lously before her husband&rsquo;s eyes.<br>
    He fetched and carried all day long as to the manner born,<br>
    And plain to all on board but him, was her conceited &ldquo;scorn&rdquo;.<br>
    And Johnson bossed his wife to show the difference between<br>
    Some husbands&mdash;wondering &rsquo;owinel a man could be so green.</p>
  <p>Now, Mrs Johnson, through it all, was anything but slack;<br>
    I&rsquo;d seen her sleepy-meaning smile behind her husband&rsquo;s back,<br>
    I&rsquo;d heard the whispered covered sneer, the stress on &ldquo;him&rdquo; and &ldquo;he&rdquo;.<br>
    She spread her charms for all men, from the captain down to me.<br>
    She used her drooping eyes on all while Johnson smoked serene,<br>
    And chuckled secretly because the world was very green.</p>
  <p>He got a wire from Adelaide&mdash;on business, understand&mdash;<br>
    And left his wife to follow round, and journeyed overland.<br>
    That very night, while musing in a quiet spot on deck,<br>
    I caught her with her arms about a first-class Johnnie&rsquo;s neck.</p>
  <p>The Johnsons live at Manly now, their lives are all serene,<br>
    And Johnson still is wondering how the world can be so green.</p>

  <p>It is&nbsp;New Year&rsquo;s Day and I rise to state that here on the Sydney
    side<br>
    The Bards have commenced to fill out of late and they&rsquo;re showing their
    binjies with pride<br>
    They&rsquo;re patting their binjies with pride, old man, and I want you to
    understand,<br>
    That a binjied bard is a bard indeed when he sings in the Southern Land,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old chaps,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he sings in the Southern Land.</p>
  <p>For the Southern Land is the Poet&rsquo;s Home, and over the world&rsquo;s
    wide roam,<br>
    There was never till now a binjied bard that lived in a poet&rsquo;s home,
    old man;<br>
    For the poet&rsquo;s home was a hell on earth, and I want you to understand,<br>
    That it isn&rsquo;t exactly a paradise down here in the Southern Land,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old chap,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down here in the Southern Land.</p>
  <p>The Beer and the Bailiff were gone last night and the &ldquo;temple&rdquo; doorstep
    clean,<br>
    And our heads are clear and our hearts are light with wine from the Riverine&mdash;<br>
    With wine from the Riverine, old man, and I want you to understand<br>
    That Bard, Beer and Bailiff too long were kin down here in the Southern Land,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down here in the Southern Land.</p>
  <p>It is not because of a larger fee, nor yet that the bards are free,<br>
    For the bards I know and the bards I see are married enough for three;<br>
    Are married enough for three, old man, and I want you to understand,<br>
    They&rsquo;ve a right to be married enough for four, down here in the Southern
    Land,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My girl,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down here in the Southern Land.</p>
  <p>But I think it&rsquo;s because a bird went round and twittered in ears of
    men<br>
    That bards have care and the world seems bare as seen from the rhyming den,<br>
    And twittered in ears of men, old chaps, and got folks to understand<br>
    That a poet is something more than a joke down here in the Southern Land,<br>

    (The &ldquo;Vincennes&rdquo;)</b></h2>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas&nbsp;the glowing log of a picnic fire where a red light should
    not be,<br>
    Or the curtained glow of a sick room light in a window that faced the sea.<br>
    But the Manly lights seemed the Sydney lights, and the bluffs as the &ldquo;Heads&rdquo; were
    seen;<br>
    And the Manly beach was the channel then&mdash;and the captain steered between.</p>
  <p>The croakers said with a shoulder shrug, and a careless, know-all glance:<br>
  &ldquo;You might pull out her stem, or pull out her stern&mdash;but she&rsquo;ll
  sail no more for France!&rdquo;<br>
    Her stem was dry when the tide was out, and behind her banked the sand,<br>
    Where strong gales come from the Hurricane east and the sun sets on the land.</p>
  <p>When the tide was high and the rollers struck she shuddered as if in pain,<br>
    She had no hope for the open sea and the fair full breeze again.<br>
    She turned her side to the pounding seas and the foam glared over the rails,<br>
    It seemed her fate to be sold and stripped, and broken by winter gales.</p>
  <p>But they sent strong gear, and they sent the gangs, and they sent her a
    man who knew,<br>
    And the tugs came nosing round from the Heads to see what a tug could do;<br>
    The four-ton anchors they laid to sea in the waves and the wind and rain,<br>
    And the great steel hawser they hove aboard made fast to her cable chain.</p>
  <p>And then, while the gaping townsfolk stared from the shining beach in doubt,<br>
    The crew and the shore-gangs lowered her yards and they hove the ballast
      out.<br>
    (To lie like a strange sea-grave upheaved on the smooth sand by her side)<br>
    And they made all ready and clear for the tugs to come on the rising tide.</p>
  <p>And so, in the night when the tide was in and a black sky hid the stars,<br>
    The shoremen worked at the jumping winch and the crew at the capstan bars.<br>
    To seaward the two tugs rose and fell in their own wild stormy glare<br>
    And her head came round for a fathom&rsquo;s length! for a mighty heave was
    there.</p>
  <p>So, tide by tide, and yard by yard, they hove her off the shore<br>
    To fit, and load for her ports of call, and to sail for France once more.<br>
    Till at last she came with the wild blind rush of a frightened thing set
    free,<br>
    And they towed her round to the Sydney Heads and in from the stormy sea.</p>
  <p>And the croakers say, when a man is down, with a shrug and a know-all glance,<br>
    Oh, he&rsquo;ll never get out of the gutter again, he has done with every
    chance;<br>
    But we&rsquo;ll &ldquo;haul and heave on the block and sheeve&rdquo;, wave-beaten
    and black-rock hemmed,<br>
    And we&rsquo;ll sail with cargoes that they shall buy, when their ships are

    News</p>
  <p>&nbsp;There&nbsp;has been many a grander deed since man had life to give,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thousands have gone to certain death, eyes open,
  that men might live;<br>
    And many have gone for their country&rsquo;s sake, when their numbers were
    all too few,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bravely died that their mates may die&mdash;to
  show what a man can do.</p>
  <p>Now this is the song of&nbsp;<i>La Bella</i>&nbsp;wreck at the harbour of
    Warnambool,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is the song of a brave, brave man of the grand
  old simple school:<br>
    We all know the forces of circumstance, and we blame not the lifeboat crew&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is the song of a fisherman who showed what
  a man can do.</p>
  <p>With a single scull in his strong young hands, and his brave young eyes
    aglow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shot his skill o&rsquo;er the raging hell, where
  the lifeboat dared not go!<br>
    It was twice and thrice that he went again, and the lives they were only
    two&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is the song of The Man Who Knows, and can
  show what a man can do.</p>
  <p>And we need such deeds in this world of ours, lest the hearts of men might
    fail&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh we need such deeds in this world of ours, and a
  man to tell the tale!<br>
    When the eloquent gestures come from the wreck, and never a word comes through&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, we need such deeds in our land to-day to show what
  a man can do!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
    this is the moral of all that is,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
  it&rsquo;s only known to two<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put
  out in your dinghy with confidence,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
  show what a man can do.</p>

  <p>&rsquo;Tis&nbsp;sunrise over Watson,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I sailed out to sea,<br>
    On that wild run to London<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wrecked and ruined me.<br>
    The beauty of the morning<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On bluff and point and bay,<br>
    But the Lily of St Leonards<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was fairer than the day.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Lily of St Leonards!<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As pure as lily gold,<br>
    And bright with childlike brightness<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wise as worlds of old.<br>
    Her heart for all was beating<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all hearts were her own&mdash;<br>
    Like sunshine through the Lily<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her purity was shown.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Lily of St Leonards!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis well you never lived
  to see<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

  <p>A leaden sky shuts over<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sobbing leaden sea,<br>
    For the Lily of St Leonards<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is never more for me.<br>
    I seek the wharf of Outward<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the deck no longer thrills<br>
    Where she stood with great tears starting<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the lights on dark wet hills.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world was all before

    Fifteen years away, and five hundred miles out;<br>
    Swag and bag and billy carried all our care<br>
    Before we were married, and I wish that I were there.</p>
  <p>River banks were grassy&mdash;grassy in the bends,<br>
    Running through the land where mateship never ends;<br>
    We belled the lazy fishing lines and droned the time away<br>
    Before we were married, and I wish it were to-day.</p>
  <p>Working down the telegraph&mdash;winters&rsquo; gales and rains<br>
    Cross the tumbled scenery of Marlborough &ldquo;plains&rdquo;,<br>
    Beach and bluff and cook&rsquo;s tent&mdash;and the cook was a &ldquo;cow&rdquo;<br>

  <p>The rolling road to Melbourne, and grey-eyed girl in fur&mdash;<br>
    One arm to a stanchion&mdash;and one round her;<br>

    While my wife&rsquo;s second husband<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was handsome, young and true;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hair is dark to-day,<br>
    While my wife&rsquo;s second husband<br>

  <p>But my wife&rsquo;s second husband<br>
    His sorrows shall forget,<br>
    We&rsquo;ll clasp warm hands in friendship<br>
    And clink our glasses yet.<br>
    We&rsquo;ll smoke cigars together,<br>
    In pure philosophy,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one they could not blame.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the world to know?</p>
  <p>The shamed and ill-used woman<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who really longs to die,<br>

    The real loafed-on woman,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dim blue in the gold.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stock and fences too,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are scrub or ploughed ground now?<br>
    A fence by Harry Dare or &ldquo;Dad&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would last it, anyhow.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they were buried there.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far away and strange,<br>
    For I have lost, except in dreams,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bush beyond the Range.<br>
    I wonder too, in fear and shame,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had forced back the heart-scalding tears<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rest and relief for my mind.<br>

  <p>Through the monsoon we rolled like a Jumbo<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a second blade shaken away,<br>

    A dry choke, and words cracked and hurried,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stare, as of something afraid,<br>
    And he told me that Hannah was buried<br>

    There&rsquo;s my publisher and lawyer, my admirers and my aunt.<br>
    Do they want a rake and a spendthrift? Look out! Tradesman trusting me!<br>
    Look out! Husbands! Fathers! Brothers! I&rsquo;ll be wicked as can be!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
now.</p>
