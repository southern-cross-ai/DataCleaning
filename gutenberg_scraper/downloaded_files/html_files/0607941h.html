  <br>

  <p class="first">I CAME to Dagon's Cave to kill Richard Brent. I went down
  the dusky avenues made by the towering trees, and my mood well-matched the
  primitive grimness of the scene.</p>

  <p>The approach to Dagon's Cave is always dark, for the mighty branches and
  thick leaves shut out the sun, and now the somberness of my own soul made the
  shadows seem more ominous and gloomy than was natural.</p>

  <p>Not far away I heard the slow wash of the waves against the tall cliffs,
  but the sea itself was out of sight, masked by the dense oak forest. The
  darkness and the stark gloom of my surroundings gripped my shadowed soul as I
  passed beneath the ancient branches&mdash;as I came out into a narrow glade
  and saw the mouth of the ancient cavern before me. I paused, scanning the
  cavern's exterior and the dim reaches of the silent oaks.</p>

  <p>The man I hated had not come before me! I was in time to carry out my grim
  intent. For a moment my resolution faltered, then like a wave there surged
  over me the fragrance of Eleanor Bland, a vision of wavy golden hair and deep
  gray eyes, changing and mystic as the sea. I clenched my hands until the
  knuckles showed white, and instinctively touched the wicked snub-nosed
  revolver whose weight sagged my coat pocket.</p>

  <p>But for Richard Brent, I felt certain I had already won this woman, desire
  for whom made my waking hours a torment and my sleep a torture. Whom did she
  love? She would not say; I did not believe she knew. Let one of us go away, I
  thought, and she would turn to the other. And I was going to simplify matters
  for her&mdash;and for myself. By chance I had overheard my blond English
  rival remark that he intended coming to lonely Dagon's Cave on an idle
  exploring outing&mdash;alone.</p>

  <p>I am not by nature criminal. I was born and raised in a hard country, and
  have lived most of my life on the raw edges of the world, where a man took
  what he wanted, if he could, and mercy was a virtue little known. But it was
  a torment that racked me day and night that sent me out to take the life of
  Richard Brent. I have lived hard, and violently, perhaps. When love overtook
  me, it also was fierce and violent. Perhaps I was not wholly sane, what with
  my love for Eleanor Bland and my hatred for Richard Brent. Under any other
  circumstances, I would have been glad to call him friend&mdash;a fine, rangy,
  upstanding young fellow, clear-eyed and strong. But he stood in the way of my
  desire and he must die.</p>

  <p>I stepped into the dimness of the cavern and halted. I had never before
  visited Dagon's Cave, yet a vague sense of misplaced familiarity troubled me
  as I gazed on the high arching roof, the even stone walls and the dusty
  floor. I shrugged my shoulders, unable to place the elusive feeling;
  doubtless it was evoked by a similarity to caverns in the mountain country of
  the American Southwest where I was born and spent my childhood.</p>

  <p>And yet I knew that I had never seen a cave like this one, whose regular
  aspect gave rise to myths that it was not a natural cavern, but had been hewn
  from the solid rock ages ago by the tiny hands of the mysterious Little
  People, the prehistoric beings of British legend. The whole countryside
  thereabouts was a haunt for ancient folk lore.</p>

  <p>The country folk were predominantly Celtic; here the Saxon invaders had
  never prevailed, and the legends reached back, in that long-settled
  countryside, further than anywhere else in England&mdash;back beyond the
  coming of the Saxons, aye, and incredibly beyond that distant age, beyond the
  coming of the Romans, to those unbelievably ancient days when the native
  Britons warred with black-haired Irish pirates.</p>

  <p>The Little People, of course, had their part in the lore. Legend said that
  this cavern was one of their last strongholds against the conquering Celts,
  and hinted at lost tunnels, long fallen in or blocked up, connecting the cave
  with a network of subterranean corridors which honeycombed the hills. With
  these chance meditations vying idly in my mind with grimmer speculations, I
  passed through the outer chamber of the cavern and entered a narrow tunnel,
  which, I knew by former descriptions, connected with a larger room.</p>

  <p>It was dark in the tunnel, but not too dark for me to make out the vague,
  half-defaced outlines of mysterious etchings on the stone walls. I ventured
  to switch on my electric torch and examine them more closely. Even in their
  dimness I was repelled by their abnormal and revolting character. Surely no
  men cast in human mold as we know it, scratched those grotesque
  obscenities.</p>

  <p>The Little People&mdash;I wondered if those anthropologists were correct
  in their theory of a squat Mongoloid aboriginal race, so low in the scale of
  evolution as to be scarcely human, yet possessing a distinct, though
  repulsive, culture of their own. They had vanished before the invading races,
  theory said, forming the base of all Aryan legends of trolls, elves, dwarfs
  and witches. Living in caves from the start, these aborigines had retreated
  farther and farther into the caverns of the hills, before the conquerors,
  vanishing at last entirely, though folklore fancy pictures their descendants
  still dwelling in the lost chasms far beneath the hills, loathsome survivors
  of an outworn age.</p>

  <p>I snapped off the torch and passed through the tunnel, to come out into a
  sort of doorway which seemed entirely too symmetrical to have been the work
  of nature. I was looking into a vast dim cavern, at a somewhat lower level
  than the outer chamber, and again I shuddered with a strange alien sense of
  familiarity. A short flight of steps led down from the tunnel to the floor of
  the cavern&mdash;tiny steps, too small for normal human feet, carved into the
  solid stone. Their edges were greatly worn away, as if by ages of use. I
  started the descent&mdash;my foot slipped suddenly. I instinctively knew what
  was coming&mdash;it was all in part with that strange feeling of
  familiarity&mdash;but I could not catch myself. I fell headlong down the
  steps and struck the stone floor with a crash that blotted out my
  senses...</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Slowly consciousness returned to me, with a throbbing of my head and a
  sensation of bewilderment. I lifted a hand to my head and found it caked with
  blood. I had received a blow, or had taken a fall, but so completely had my
  wits been knocked out of me that my mind was an absolute blank. Where I was,
  who I was, I did not know. I looked about, blinking in the dim light, and saw
  that I was in a wide, dusty cavern. I stood at the foot of a short flight of
  steps which led upward into some kind of tunnel. I ran my hand dazedly
  through my square-cut black mane, and my eyes wandered over my massive naked
  limbs and powerful torso. I was clad, I noticed absently, in a sort of
  loincloth, from the girdle of which swung an empty scabbard, and leathern
  sandals were on my feet.</p>

  <p>Then I saw an object lying at my feet, and stooped and took it up. It was
  a heavy iron sword, whose broad blade was darkly stained. My fingers fitted
  instinctively about its hilt with the familiarity of long usage. Then
  suddenly I remembered and laughed to think that a fall on his head should
  render me, Conan of the reavers, so completely daft. Aye, it all came back to
  me now. It had been a raid on the Britons, on whose coasts we continually
  swooped with torch and sword, from the island called Eireann. That day we of
  the black-haired Gael had swept suddenly down on a coastal village in our
  long, low ships and in the hurricane of battle which followed, the Britons
  had at last given up the stubborn contest and retreated, warriors, women and
  bairns, into the deep shadows of the oak forests, whither we seldom dared
  follow.</p>

  <p>But I had followed, for there was a girl of my foes whom I desired with a
  burning passion, a lithe, slim young creature with wavy golden hair and deep
  gray eyes, changing and mystic as the sea. Her name was Tamera&mdash;well I
  knew it, for there was trade between the races as well as war, and I had been
  in the villages of the Britons as a peaceful visitor, in times of rare
  truce.</p>

  <p>I saw her white half-clad body flickering among the trees as she ran with
  the swiftness of a doe, and I followed, panting with fierce eagerness. Under
  the dark shadows of the gnarled oaks she fled, with me in close pursuit,
  while far away behind us died out the shouts of slaughter and the clashing of
  swords. Then we ran in silence, save for her quick labored panting, and I was
  so close behind her as we emerged into a narrow glade before a somber-mouthed
  cavern, that I caught her flying golden tresses with one mighty hand. She
  sank down with a despairing wail, and even so, a shout echoed her cry and I
  wheeled quickly to face a rangy young Briton who sprang from among the trees,
  the light of desperation in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Vertorix!" the girl wailed, her voice breaking in a sob, and fiercer rage
  welled up in me, for I knew the lad was her lover.</p>

  <p>"Run for the forest, Tamera!" he shouted, and leaped at me as a panther
  leaps, his bronze ax whirling like a flashing wheel about his head. And then
  sounded the clangor of strife and the hard-drawn panting of combat.</p>

  <p>The Briton was as tall as I, but he was lithe where I was massive. The
  advantage of sheer muscular power was mine, and soon he was on the defensive,
  striving desperately to parry my heavy strokes with his ax. Hammering on his
  guard like a smith on an anvil, I pressed him relentlessly, driving him
  irresistibly before me. His chest heaved, his breath came in labored gasps,
  his blood dripped from scalp, chest and thigh where my whistling blade had
  cut the skin, and all but gone home. As I redoubled my strokes and he bent
  and swayed beneath them like a sapling in a storm, I heard the girl cry:
  "Vertorix! Vertorix! The cave! Into the cave!"</p>

  <p>I saw his face pale with a fear greater than that induced by my hacking
  sword.</p>

  <p>"Not there!" he gasped. "Better a clean death! In Il-marenin's name, girl,
  run into the forest and save yourself!"</p>

  <p>"I will not leave you!" she cried. "The cave! It is our one chance!"</p>

  <p>I saw her flash past us like a flying wisp of white and vanish in the
  cavern, and with a despairing cry, the youth launched a wild desperate stroke
  that nigh cleft my skull. As I staggered beneath the blow I had barely
  parried, he sprang away, leaped into the cavern after the girl and vanished
  in the gloom.</p>

  <p>With a maddened yell that invoked all my grim Gaelic gods, I sprang
  recklessly after them, not reckoning if the Briton lurked beside the entrance
  to brain me as I rushed in. But a quick glance showed the chamber empty and a
  wisp of white disappearing through a dark doorway in the back wall.</p>

  <p>I raced across the cavern and came to a sudden halt as an ax licked out of
  the gloom of the entrance and whistled perilously close to my black-maned
  head. I gave back suddenly. Now the advantage was with Vertorix, who stood in
  the narrow mouth of the corridor where I could hardly come at him without
  exposing myself to the devastating stroke of his ax.</p>

  <p>I was near frothing with fury and the sight of a slim white form among the
  deep shadows behind the warrior drove me into a frenzy. I attacked savagely
  but warily, thrusting venomously at my foe, and drawing back from his
  strokes. I wished to draw him out into a wide lunge, avoid it and run him
  through before he could recover his balance. In the open I could have beat
  him down by sheer power and heavy blows, but here I could only use the point
  and that at a disadvantage; I always preferred the edge. But I was stubborn;
  if I could not come at him with a finishing stroke, neither could he or the
  girl escape me while I kept him hemmed in the tunnel.</p>

  <p>It must have been the realization of this fact that prompted the girl's
  action, for she said something to Vertorix about looking for a way leading
  out, and though he cried out fiercely forbidding her to venture away into the
  darkness, she turned and ran swiftly down the tunnel to vanish in the
  dimness. My wrath rose appallingly and I nearly got my head split in my
  eagerness to bring down my foe before she found a means for their escape.</p>

  <p>Then the cavern echoed with a terrible scream and Vertorix cried out like
  a man death-stricken, his face ashy in the gloom. He whirled, as if he had
  forgotten me and my sword, and raced down the tunnel like a madman, shrieking
  Tamera's name. From far away, as if from the bowels of the earth, I seemed to
  hear her answering cry, mingled with a strange sibilant clamor that
  electrified me with nameless but instinctive horror. Then silence fell,
  broken only by Vertorix's frenzied cries, receding farther and farther into
  the earth.</p>

  <p>Recovering myself I sprang into the tunnel and raced after the Briton as
  recklessly as he had run after the girl. And to give me my due, red-handed
  reaver though I was, cutting down my rival from behind was less in my mind
  than discovering what dread thing had Tamera in its clutches.</p>

  <p>As I ran along I noted absently that the sides of the tunnel were scrawled
  with monstrous pictures, and realized suddenly and creepily that this must be
  the dread Cavern of the Children of the Night, tales of which had crossed the
  narrow sea to resound horrifically in the ears of the Gaels. Terror of me
  must have ridden Tamera hard to have driven her into the cavern shunned by
  her people, where it was said, lurked the survivors of that grisly race which
  inhabited the land before the coming of the Picts and Britons, and which had
  fled before them into the unknown caverns of the hills.</p>

  <p>Ahead of me the tunnel opened into a wide chamber, and I saw the white
  form of Vertorix glimmer momentarily in the semidarkness and vanish in what
  appeared to be the entrance of a corridor opposite the mouth of the tunnel I
  had just traversed. Instantly there sounded a short, fierce shout and the
  crash of a hard-driven blow, mixed with the hysterical screams of a girl and
  a medley of serpentlike hissing that made my hair bristle. And at that
  instant I shot out of the tunnel, running at full speed, and realized too
  late the floor of the cavern lay several feet below the level of the tunnel.
  My flying feet missed the tiny steps and I crashed terrifically on the solid
  stone floor.</p>

  <p>Now as I stood in the semidarkness, rubbing my aching head, all this came
  back to me, and I stared fearsomely across the vast chamber at that black
  cryptic corridor into which Tamera and her lover had disappeared, and over
  which silence lay like a pall. Gripping my sword, I warily crossed the great
  still cavern and peered into the corridor. Only a denser darkness met my
  eyes. I entered, striving to pierce the gloom, and as my foot slipped on a
  wide wet smear on the stone floor, the raw acrid scent of fresh-spilled blood
  met my nostrils. Someone or something had died there, either the young Briton
  or his unknown attacker.</p>

  <p>I stood there uncertainly, all the supernatural fears that are the
  heritage of the Gael rising in my primitive soul. I could turn and stride out
  of these accursed mazes, into the clear sunlight and down to the clean blue
  sea where my comrades, no doubt, impatiently awaited me after the routing of
  the Britons. Why should I risk my life among these grisly rat dens? I was
  eaten with curiosity to know what manner of beings haunted the cavern, and
  who were called the Children of the Night by the Britons, but in it was my
  love for the yellow-haired girl which drove me down that dark tunnel&mdash;
  and love her I did, in my way, and would have been kind to her, had I carried
  her away to my island haunt.</p>

  <p>I walked softly along the corridor, blade ready. What sort of creatures
  the Children of the Night were, I had no idea, but the tales of the Britons
  had lent them a distinctly inhuman nature.</p>

  <p>The darkness closed around me as I advanced, until I was moving in utter
  blackness. My groping left hand encountered a strangely carven doorway, and
  at that instant something hissed like a viper beside me and slashed fiercely
  at my thigh. I struck back savagely and felt my blind stroke crunch home, and
  something fell at my feet and died. What thing I had slain in the dark I
  could not know, but it must have been at least partly human because the
  shallow gash in my thigh had been made with a blade of some sort, and not by
  fangs or talons. And I sweated with horror, for the gods know, the hissing
  voice of the Thing had resembled no human tongue I had ever heard.</p>

  <p>And now in the darkness ahead of me I heard the sound repeated, mingled
  with horrible slitherings, as if numbers of reptilian creatures were
  approaching. I stepped quickly into the entrance my groping hand had
  discovered and came near repeating my headlong fall, for instead of letting
  into another level corridor, the entrance gave onto a flight of dwarfish
  steps on which I floundered wildly.</p>

  <p>Recovering my balance I went on cautiously, groping along the sides of the
  shaft for support. I seemed to be descending into the very bowels of the
  earth, but I dared not turn back. Suddenly, far below me, I glimpsed a faint
  eerie light. I went on, perforce, and came to a spot where the shaft opened
  into another great vaulted chamber; and I shrank back, aghast.</p>

  <p>In the center of the chamber stood a grim, black altar; it had been rubbed
  all over with a sort of phosphorous, so that it glowed dully, lending a
  semi-illumination to the shadowy cavern. Towering behind it on a pedestal of
  human skulls, lay a cryptic black object, carven with mysterious
  hieroglyphics. The Black Stone! The ancient, ancient Stone before which, the
  Britons said, the Children of the Night bowed in gruesome worship, and whose
  origin was lost in the black mists of a hideously distant past. Once, legend
  said, it had stood in that grim circle of monoliths called Stonehenge, before
  its votaries had been driven like chaff before the bows of the Picts.</p>

  <p>But I gave it but a passing, shuddering glance. Two figures lay, bound
  with rawhide thongs, on the glowing black altar. One was Tamera; the other
  was Vertorix, bloodstained and disheveled. His bronze ax, crusted with
  clotted blood, lay near the altar. And before the glowing stone squatted
  Horror.</p>

  <p>Though I had never seen one of those ghoulish aborigines, I knew this
  thing for what it was, and shuddered. It was a man of a sort, but so low in
  the stage of life that its distorted humanness was more horrible than its
  bestiality.</p>

  <p>Erect, it could not have been five feet in height. Its body was scrawny
  and deformed, its head disproportionately large. Lank snaky hair fell over a
  square inhuman face with flabby writhing lips that bared yellow fangs, flat
  spreading nostrils and great yellow slant eyes. I knew the creature must be
  able to see in the dark as well as a cat. Centuries of skulking in dim
  caverns had lent the race terrible and inhuman attributes. But the most
  repellent feature was its skin: scaly, yellow and mottled, like the hide of a
  serpent. A loincloth made of a real snake's skin girt its lean loins, and its
  taloned hands gripped a short stone-tipped spear and a sinister-looking
  mallet of polished flint.</p>

  <p>So intently was it gloating over its captives, it evidently had not heard
  my stealthy descent. As I hesitated in the shadows of the shaft, far above me
  I heard a soft sinister rustling that chilled the blood in my veins. The
  Children were creeping down the shaft behind me, and I was trapped. I saw
  other entrances opening on the chamber, and I acted, realizing that an
  alliance with Vertorix was our only hope. Enemies though we were, we were
  men, cast in the same mold, trapped in the lair of these indescribable
  monstrosities.</p>

  <p>As I stepped from the shaft, the horror beside the altar jerked up his
  head and glared full at me. And as he sprang up, I leaped and he crumpled,
  blood spurting, as my heavy sword split his reptilian heart. But even as he
  died, he gave tongue in an abhorrent shriek which was echoed far up the
  shaft. In desperate haste I cut Vertorix's bonds and dragged him to his feet.
  And I turned to Tamera, who in that dire extremity did not shrink from me,
  but looked up at me with pleading, terror-dilated eyes. Vertorix wasted no
  time in words, realizing chance had made allies of us. He snatched up his ax
  as I freed the girl.</p>

  <p>"We can't go up the shaft," he explained swiftly; "we'll have the whole
  pack upon us quickly. They caught Tamera as she sought for an exit, and
  overpowered me by sheer numbers when I followed. They dragged us hither and
  all but that carrion scattered&mdash;bearing word of the sacrifice through
  all their burrows, I doubt not. Il-marenin alone knows how many of my people,
  stolen in the night, have died on that altar. We must take our chance in one
  of these tunnels&mdash;all lead to Hell! Follow me!"</p>

  <p>Seizing Tamera's hand he ran fleetly into the nearest tunnel and I
  followed. A glance back into the chamber before a turn in the corridor
  blotted it from view showed a revolting horde streaming out of the shaft. The
  tunnel slanted steeply upward, and suddenly ahead of us we saw a bar of gray
  light. But the next instant our cries of hope changed to curses of bitter
  disappointment. There was daylight, aye, drifting in through a cleft in the
  vaulted roof, but far, far above our reach. Behind us the pack gave tongue
  exultingly. And I halted.</p>

  <p>"Save yourselves if you can," I growled. "Here I make my stand. They can
  see in the dark and I cannot. Here at least I can see them. Go!"</p>

  <p>But Vertorix halted also. "Little use to be hunted like rats to our doom.
  There is no escape. Let us meet our fate like men."</p>

  <p>Tamera cried out, wringing her hands, but she clung to her lover.</p>

  <p>"Stand behind me with the girl," I grunted. "When I fall, dash out her
  brains with your ax lest they take her alive again. Then sell your own life
  as high as you may, for there is none to avenge us."</p>

  <p>His keen eyes met mine squarely.</p>

  <p>"We worship different gods, reaver," he said, "but all gods love brave
  men. Mayhap we shall meet again, beyond the Dark."</p>

  <p>"Hail and farewell, Briton!" I growled, and our right hands gripped like
  steel.</p>

  <p>"Hail and farewell, Gael!"</p>

  <p>And I wheeled as a hideous horde swept up the tunnel and burst into the
  dim light, a flying nightmare of streaming snaky hair, foam-flecked lips and
  glaring eyes. Thundering my war-cry I sprang to meet them and my heavy sword
  sang and a head spun grinning from its shoulder on an arching fountain of
  blood. They came upon me like a wave and the fighting madness of my race was
  upon me. I fought as a maddened beast fights and at every stroke I clove
  through flesh and bone, and blood spattered in a crimson rain.</p>

  <p>Then as they surged in and I went down beneath the sheer weight of their
  numbers, a fierce yell cut the din and Vertorix's ax sang above me,
  splattering blood and brains like water. The press slackened and I staggered
  up, trampling the writhing bodies beneath my feet.</p>

  <p>"A stair behind us!" the Briton was screaming. "Half-hidden in an angle of
  the wall! It must lead to daylight! Up it, in the name of Il-marenin!"</p>

  <p>So we fell back, fighting our way inch by inch. The vermin fought like
  blood-hungry devils, clambering over the bodies of the slain to screech and
  hack. Both of us were streaming blood at every step when we reached the mouth
  of the shaft, into which Tamera had preceded us.</p>

  <p>Screaming like very fiends the Children surged in to drag us down. The
  shaft was not as light as had been the corridor, and it grew darker as we
  climbed, but our foes could only come at us from in front. By the gods, we
  slaughtered them till the stair was littered with mangled corpses and the
  Children frothed like mad wolves! Then suddenly they abandoned the fray and
  raced back down the steps.</p>

  <p>"What portends this?" gasped Vertorix, shaking the bloody sweat from his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Up the shaft, quick!" I panted. "They mean to mount some other stair and
  come at us from above!"</p>

  <p>So we raced up those accursed steps, slipping and stumbling, and as we
  fled past a black tunnel that opened into the shaft, far down it we heard a
  frightful howling. An instant later we emerged from the shaft into a winding
  corridor, dimly illumined by a vague gray light filtering in from above, and
  somewhere in the bowels of the earth I seemed to hear the thunder of rushing
  water. We started down the corridor and as we did so, a heavy weight smashed
  on my shoulders, knocking me headlong, and a mallet crashed again and again
  on my head, sending dull red flashes of agony across my brain. With a
  volcanic wrench I dragged my attacker off and under me, and tore out his
  throat with my naked fingers. And his fangs met in my arm in his
  death-bite.</p>

  <p>Reeling up, I saw that Tamera and Vertorix had passed out of sight. I had
  been somewhat behind them, and they had run on, knowing nothing of the fiend
  which had leaped on my shoulders. Doubtless they thought I was still close on
  their heels. A dozen steps I took, then halted. The corridor branched and I
  knew not which way my companions had taken. At blind venture I turned into
  the left-hand branch, and staggered on in the semidarkness. I was weak from
  fatigue and loss of blood, dizzy and sick from the blows I had received. Only
  the thought of Tamera kept me doggedly on my feet. Now distinctly I heard the
  sound of an unseen torrent.</p>

  <p>That I was not far underground was evident by the dim light which filtered
  in from somewhere above, and I momentarily expected to come upon another
  stair. But when I did, I halted in black despair; instead of up, it led down.
  Somewhere far behind me I heard faintly the howls of the pack, and I went
  down, plunging into utter darkness. At last I struck a level and went along
  blindly. I had given up all hope of escape, and only hoped to find
  Tamera&mdash;if she and her lover had not found a way of escape&mdash;and die with
  her. The thunder of rushing water was above my head now, and the tunnel was
  slimy and dank. Drops of moisture fell on my head and I knew I was passing
  under the river.</p>

  <p>Then I blundered again upon steps cut in the stone, and these led upward.
  I scrambled up as fast as my stiffening wounds would allow&mdash;and I had
  taken punishment enough to have killed an ordinary man. Up I went and up, and
  suddenly daylight burst on me through a cleft in the solid rock. I stepped
  into the blaze of the sun. I was standing on a ledge high above the rushing
  waters of a river which raced at awesome speed between towering cliffs. The
  ledge on which I stood was close to the top of the cliff; safety was within
  arm's length. But I hesitated and such was my love for the golden-haired girl
  that I was ready to retrace my steps through those black tunnels on the mad
  hope of finding her. Then I started.</p>

  <p>Across the river I saw another cleft in the cliff-wall which fronted me,
  with a ledge similar to that on which I stood, but longer. In olden times, I
  doubt not, some sort of primitive bridge connected the two ledges&mdash;
  possibly before the tunnel was dug beneath the riverbed. Now as I watched,
  two figures emerged upon that other ledge&mdash;one gashed, dust-stained,
  limping, gripping a bloodstained ax; the other slim, white and girlish.</p>

  <p>Vertorix and Tamera! They had taken the other branch of the corridor at
  the fork and had evidently followed the windows of the tunnel to emerge as I
  had done, except that I had taken the left turn and passed clear under the
  river. And now I saw that they were in a trap. On that side the cliffs rose
  half a hundred feet higher than on my side of the river, and so sheer a
  spider could scarce have scaled them. There were only two ways of escape from
  the ledge: back through the fiend-haunted tunnels, or straight down to the
  river which raved far beneath.</p>

  <p>I saw Vertorix look up the sheer cliffs and then down, and shake his head
  in despair. Tamara put her arms about his neck, and though I could not hear
  their voices for the rush of the river, I saw them smile, and then they went
  together to the edge of the ledge. And out of the cleft swarmed a loathsome
  mob, as foul reptiles writhe up out of the darkness, and they stood blinking
  in the sunlight like the night-things they were. I gripped my sword-hilt in
  the agony of my helplessness until the blood trickled from under my
  fingernails. Why had not the pack followed me instead of my companions?</p>

  <p>The Children hesitated an instant as the two Britons faced them, then with
  a laugh Vertorix hurled his ax far out into the rushing river, and turning,
  caught Tamera in a last embrace. Together they sprang far out, and still
  locked in each other's arms, hurtled downward, struck the madly foaming water
  that seemed to leap up to meet them, and vanished. And the wild river swept
  on like a blind, insensate monster, thundering along the echoing cliffs.</p>

  <p>A moment I stood frozen, then like a man in a dream I turned, caught the
  edge of the cliff above me and wearily drew myself up and over, and stood on
  my feet above the cliffs, hearing like a dim dream the roar of the river far
  beneath.</p>

  <p>I reeled up, dazedly clutching my throbbing head, on which dried blood was
  clotted. I glared wildly about me. I had clambered the cliffs&mdash;no, by
  the thunder of Crom, I was still in the cavern! I reached for my sword&mdash;</p>

  <p>The mists faded and I stared about dizzily, orienting myself with space
  and time. I stood at the foot of the steps down which I had fallen. I who had
  been Conan the reaver, was John O'Brien. Was all that grotesque interlude a
  dream? Could a mere dream appear so vivid? Even in dreams, we often know we
  are dreaming, but Conan the reaver had no cognizance of any other existence.
  More, he remembered his own past life as a living man remembers, though in
  the waking mind of John O'Brien, that memory faded into dust and mist. But
  the adventures of Conan in the Cavern of the Children stood clear-etched in
  the mind of John O'Brien.</p>

  <p>I glanced across the dim chamber toward the entrance of the tunnel into
  which Vertorix had followed the girl. But I looked in vain, seeing only the
  bare blank wall of the cavern. I crossed the chamber, switched on my electric
  torch&mdash;miraculously unbroken in my fall&mdash;and felt along the
  wall.</p>

  <p>Ha! I started, as from an electric shock! Exactly where the entrance
  should have been, my fingers detected a difference in material, a section
  which was rougher than the rest of the wall. I was convinced that it was of
  comparatively modern workmanship; the tunnel had been walled up.</p>

  <p>I thrust against it, exerting all my strength, and it seemed to me that
  the section was about to give. I drew back, and taking a deep breath,
  launched my full weight against it, backed by all the power of my giant
  muscles. The brittle, decaying wall gave way with a shattering crash and I
  catapulted through in a shower of stones and falling masonry.</p>

  <p>I scrambled up, a sharp cry escaping me. I stood in a tunnel, and I could
  not mistake the feeling of similarity this time. Here Vertorix had first
  fallen foul of the Children, as they dragged Tamera away, and here where I
  now stood the floor had been awash with blood.</p>

  <p>I walked down the corridor like a man in a trance. Soon I should come to
  the doorway on the left&mdash;aye, there it was, the strangely carven portal,
  at the mouth of which I had slain the unseen being which reared up in the
  dark beside me. I shivered momentarily. Could it be possible that remnants of
  that foul race still lurked hideously in these remote caverns?</p>

  <p>I turned into the doorway and my light shone down a long, slanting shaft,
  with tiny steps cut into the solid stone. Down these had Conan the reaver
  gone groping and down them went I, John O'Brien, with memories of that other
  life filling my brain with vague phantasms. No light glimmered ahead of me
  but I came into the great dim chamber I had known of yore, and I shuddered as
  I saw the grim black altar etched in the gleam of my torch. Now no bound
  figures writhed there, no crouching horror gloated before it. Nor did the
  pyramid of skulls support the Black Stone before which unknown races had
  bowed before Egypt was born out of time's dawn. Only a littered heap of dust
  lay strewn where the skulls had upheld the hellish thing. No, that had been
  no dream: I was John O'Brien, but I had been Conan of the reavers in that
  other life, and that grim interlude a brief episode of reality which I had
  relived.</p>

  <p>I entered the tunnel down which we had fled, shining a beam of light
  ahead, and saw the bar of gray light drifting down from above&mdash;just as
  in that other, lost age. Here the Briton and I, Conan, had turned at bay. I
  turned my eyes from the ancient cleft high up in the vaulted roof, and looked
  for the stair. There it was, half-concealed by an angle in the wall.</p>

  <p>I mounted, remembering how hurriedly Vertorix and I had gone up so many
  ages before, with the horde hissing and frothing at our heels. I found myself
  tense with dread as I approached the dark, gaping entrance through which the
  pack had sought to cut us off. I had snapped off the light when I came into
  the dim-lit corridor below, and now I glanced into the well of blackness
  which opened on the stair. And with a cry I started back, nearly losing my
  footing on the worn steps. Sweating in the semidarkness I switched on the
  light and directed its beam into the cryptic opening, revolver in hand.</p>

  <p>I saw only the bare rounded sides of a small shaftlike tunnel and I
  laughed nervously. My imagination was running riot; I could have sworn that
  hideous yellow eyes glared terribly at me from the darkness, and that a
  crawling something had scuttered away down the tunnel. I was foolish to let
  these imaginings upset me. The Children had long vanished from these caverns;
  a nameless and abhorrent race closer to the serpent than the man, they had
  centuries ago faded back into the oblivion from which they had crawled in the
  black dawn ages of the Earth.</p>

  <p>I came out of the shaft into the winding corridor, which, as I remembered
  of old, was lighter. Here from the shadows a lurking thing had leaped on my
  back while my companions ran on, unknowing. What a brute of a man Conan had
  been, to keep going after receiving such savage wounds! Aye, in that age all
  men were iron.</p>

  <p>I came to the place where the tunnel forked and as before I took the
  left-hand branch and came to the shaft that led down. Down this I went, listening
  for the roar of the river, but not hearing it. Again the darkness shut in
  about the shaft, so I was forced to have recourse to my electric torch again,
  lest I lose my footing and plunge to my death. Oh, I, John O'Brien, am not
  nearly so sure-footed as was I, Conan the reaver; no, nor as tigerishly
  powerful and quick, either.</p>

  <p>I soon struck the dank lower level and felt again the dampness that
  denoted my position under the riverbed, but still I could not hear the rush
  of the water. And indeed I knew that whatever mighty river had rushed roaring
  to the sea in those ancient times, there was no such body of water among the
  hills today. I halted, flashing my light about. I was in a vast tunnel, not
  very high of roof, but broad. Other smaller tunnels branched off from it and
  I wondered at the network which apparently honeycombed the hills.</p>

  <p>I cannot describe the grim, gloomy effect of those dark, low-roofed
  corridors far below the earth. Over all hung an overpowering sense of
  unspeakable antiquity. Why had the little people carved out these mysterious
  crypts, and in which black age? Were these caverns their last refuge from the
  onrushing tides of humanity, or their castles since time immemorial? I shook
  my head in bewilderment; the bestiality of the Children I had seen, yet
  somehow they had been able to carve these tunnels and chambers that might
  balk modern engineers. Even supposing they had but completed a task begun by
  nature, still it was a stupendous work for a race of dwarfish aborigines.</p>

  <p>Then I realized with a start that I was spending more time in these gloomy
  tunnels than I cared for, and began to hunt for the steps by which Conan had
  ascended. I found them and, following them up, breathed again deeply in
  relief as the sudden glow of daylight filled the shaft. I came out upon the
  ledge, now worn away until it was little more than a bump on the face of the
  cliff. And I saw the great river, which had roared like a prisoned monster
  between the sheer walls of its narrow canyon, had dwindled away with the
  passing eons until it was no more than a tiny stream, far beneath me,
  trickling soundlessly among the stones on its way to the sea.</p>

  <p>Aye, the surface of the earth changes; the rivers swell or shrink, the
  mountains heave and topple, the lakes dry up, the continents alter; but under
  the earth the work of lost, mysterious hands slumbers untouched by the sweep
  of Time. Their work, aye, but what of the hands that reared that work? Did
  they, too, lurk beneath the bosoms of the hills?</p>

  <p>How long I stood there, lost in dim speculations, I do not know, but
  suddenly, glancing across at the other ledge, crumbling and weathered, I
  shrank back into the entrance behind me. Two figures came out upon the ledge
  and I gasped to see that they were Richard Brent and Eleanor Bland. Now I
  remembered why I had come to the cavern and my hand instinctively sought the
  revolver in my pocket. They did not see me. But I could see them, and hear
  them plainly, too, since no roaring river now thundered between the
  ledges.</p>

  <p>"By gad, Eleanor," Brent was saying, "I'm glad you decided to come with
  me. Who would have guessed there was anything to those old tales about hidden
  tunnels leading from the cavern? I wonder how that section of wall came to
  collapse? I thought I heard a crash just as we entered the outer cave. Do you
  suppose some beggar was in the cavern ahead of us, and broke it in?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she answered. "I remember&mdash;oh, I don't know. It
  almost seems as if I'd been here before, or dreamed I had. I seem to faintly
  remember, like a far-off nightmare, running, running, running endlessly
  through these dark corridors with hideous creatures on my heels..."</p>

  <p>"Was I there?" jokingly asked Brent.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and John, too," she answered. "But you were not Richard Brent, and
  John was not John O'Brien. No, and I was not Eleanor Bland, either. Oh, it's
  so dim and far-off I can't describe it at all. It's hazy and misty and
  terrible."</p>

  <p>"I understand, a little," he said unexpectedly. "Ever since we came to the
  place where the wall had fallen and revealed the old tunnel, I've had a sense
  of familiarity with the place. There was horror and danger and battle&mdash;
  and love, too."</p>

  <p>He stepped nearer the edge to look down in the gorge, and Eleanor cried
  out sharply and suddenly, seizing him in a convulsive grasp.</p>

  <p>"Don't, Richard, don't! Hold me, oh, hold me tight!"</p>

  <p>He caught her in his arms. "Why, Eleanor, dear, what's the matter?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she faltered, but she clung closer to him and I saw she was
  trembling. "Just a strange feeling&mdash;rushing dizziness and fright, just
  as if I were falling from a great height. Don't go near the edge, Dick; it
  scares me."</p>

  <p>"I won't, dear," he answered, drawing her closer to him, and continuing
  hesitantly: "Eleanor, there's something I've wanted to ask you for a long
  time&mdash;well, I haven't the knack of putting things in an elegant way. I
  love you, Eleanor; always have. You know that. But if you don't love me, I'll
  take myself off and won't annoy you any more. Only please tell me one way or
  another, for I can't stand it any longer. Is it I or the American?"</p>

  <p>"You, Dick," she answered, hiding her face on his shoulder. "It's always
  been you, though I didn't know it. I think a great deal of John O'Brien. I
  didn't know which of you I really loved. But today as we came through those
  terrible tunnels and climbed those fearful stairs, and just now, when I
  thought for some strange reason we were falling from the ledge, I realized it
  was you I loved&mdash;that I always loved you, through more lives than this
  one. Always!"</p>

  <p>Their lips met and I saw her golden head cradled on his shoulder. My lips
  were dry, my heart cold, yet my soul was at peace. They belonged to each
  other. Eons ago they lived and loved, and because of that love they suffered
  and died. And I, Conan, had driven them to that doom.</p>

  <p>I saw them turn toward the cleft, their arms about each other, then I
  heard Tamera&mdash;I mean Eleanor&mdash;shriek. I saw them both recoil. And
  out of the cleft a horror came writhing, a loathsome, brain-shattering thing
  that blinked in the clean sunlight. Aye, I knew it of old&mdash;vestige of a
  forgotten age, it came writhing its horrid shape up out of the darkness of
  the Earth and the lost past to claim its own.</p>

  <p>What three thousand years of retrogression can do to a race hideous in the
  beginning, I saw, and shuddered. And instinctively I knew that in all the
  world it was the only one of its kind, a monster that had lived on. God alone
  knows how many centuries, wallowing in the slime of its dank subterranean
  lairs. Before the Children had vanished, the race must have lost all human
  semblance, living as they did, the life of the reptile.</p>

  <p>This thing was more like a giant serpent than anything else, but it had
  aborted legs and snaky arms with hooked talons. It crawled on its belly,
  writhing back mottled lips to bare needlelike fangs, which I felt must drip
  with venom. It hissed as it reared up its ghastly head on a horribly long
  neck, while its yellow slanted eyes glittered with all the horror that is
  spawned in the black lairs under the earth.</p>

  <p>I knew those eyes had blazed at me from the dark tunnel opening on the
  stair. For some reason the creature had fled from me, possibly because it
  feared my light, and it stood to reason that it was the only one remaining in
  the caverns, else I had been set upon in the darkness. But for it, the
  tunnels could be traversed in safety.</p>

  <p>Now the reptilian thing writhed toward the humans trapped on the ledge.
  Brent had thrust Eleanor behind him and stood, face ashy, to guard her as
  best he could. And I gave thanks silently that I, John O'Brien, could pay the
  debt I, Conan the reaver, owed these lovers since long ago.</p>

  <p>The monster reared up and Brent, with cold courage, sprang to meet it with
  his naked hands. Taking quick aim, I fired once. The shot echoed like the
  crack of doom between the towering cliffs, and the Horror, with a hideously
  human scream, staggered wildly, swayed and pitched headlong, knotting and
  writhing like a wounded python, to tumble from the sloping ledge and fall
  plummetlike to the rocks far below.</p>
