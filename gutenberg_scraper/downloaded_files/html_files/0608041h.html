<h2><a id="hawks1" name="hawks1">I. &mdash; A MAN RETURNS</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">"HALT!" The bearded man-at-arms swung his
pike about, growling like a surly mastiff. It paid to be wary on
the road to Antioch. The stars blinked redly through the thick
night and their light was not sufficient for the fellow to make out
what sort of man it was who loomed so gigantically before him.</p>

<p>An iron-clad hand shot out suddenly and closed on the soldier's
mailed shoulder in a grasp that numbed his whole arm. From beneath
the helmet the guardsman saw the blaze of ferocious blue eyes that
seemed lambent, even in the dark.</p>

<p>"Saints preserve us!" gasped the frightened man-at-arms, "Cormac
FitzGeoffrey! Avaunt! Back to Hell with ye, like a good knight! I
swear to you, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Swear me no oaths," growled the knight. "What is this
talk?"</p>

<p>"Are you not an incorporeal spirit?" mouthed the soldier. "Were
you not slain by the Moorish corsairs on your homeward voyage?"</p>

<p>"By the accursed gods!" snarled FitzGeoffrey. "Does this hand
feel like smoke?"</p>

<p>He sank his mailed fingers into the soldier's arm and grinned
bleakly at the resultant howl.</p>

<p>"Enough of such mummery; tell me who is within that tavern."</p>

<p>"Only my master, Sir Rupert de Vaile, of Rouen."</p>

<p>"Good enough," grunted the other. "He is one of the few men I
count friends, in the East or elsewhere."</p>

<p>The big warrior strode to the tavern door and entered, treading
lightly as a cat despite his heavy armor. The man-at-arms rubbed
his arm and stared after him curiously, noting, in the dim light,
that FitzGeoffrey bore a shield with the horrific emblem of his
family&mdash;a white grinning skull. The guardsman knew him of
old&mdash;a turbulent character, a savage fighter and the only man
among the Crusaders who had been esteemed stronger than Richard the
Lion-hearted. But FitzGeoffrey had taken ship for his native isle
even before Richard had departed from the Holy Land. The Third
Crusade had ended in failure and disgrace; most of the Frankish
knights had followed their kings homeward. What was this grim Irish
killer doing on the road to Antioch?</p>

<p>Sir Rupert de Vaile, once of Rouen, now a lord of the
fast-fading Outremer, turned as the great form bulked in the
doorway. Cormac FitzGeoffrey was a fraction of an inch above six
feet, but with his mighty shoulders and two hundred pounds of iron
muscle, he seemed shorter. The Norman stared in surprized
recognition, and sprang to his feet. His fine face shone with
sincere pleasure.</p>

<p>"Cormac, by the saints! Why, man, we heard that you were
dead!"</p>

<p>Cormac returned the hearty grip, while his thin lips curved
slightly in what would have been, in another man, a broad grin of
greeting. Sir Rupert was a tall man, and well knit, but he seemed
almost slight beside the huge Irish warrior who combined bulk with
a sort of dynamic aggressiveness that was apparent in his every
movement.</p>

<p>FitzGeoffrey was clean-shaven and the various scars that showed
on his dark, grim face lent his already formidable features a truly
sinister aspect. When he took off his plain visorless helmet and
thrust back his mail coif, his square-cut, black hair that topped
his low broad forehead contrasted strongly with his cold blue eyes.
A true son of the most indomitable and savage race that ever trod
the bloodstained fields of battle, Cormac FitzGeoffrey looked to be
what he was&mdash;a ruthless fighter, born to the game of war, to
whom the ways of violence and bloodshed were as natural as the ways
of peace are to the average man.</p>

<p>Son of a woman of the O'Briens and a renegade Norman knight,
Geoffrey the Bastard, in whose veins, it is said, coursed the blood
of William the Conqueror, Cormac had seldom known an hour of peace
or ease in all his thirty years of violent life. He was born in a
feud-torn and blood-drenched land, and raised in a heritage of hate
and savagery. The ancient culture of Erin had long crumbled before
the repeated onslaughts of Norsemen and Danes. Harried on all sides
by cruel foes, the rising civilization of the Celts had faded
before the fierce necessity of incessant conflict, and the
merciless struggle for survival had made the Gaels as savage as the
heathens who assailed them.</p>

<p>Now, in Cormac's time, war upon red war swept the crimson isle,
where clan fought clan, and the Norman adventurers tore at one
another's throats, or resisted the attacks of the Irish, playing
tribe against tribe, while from Norway and the Orkneys the still
half-pagan Vikings ravaged all impartially.</p>

<p>A vague realization of all this flashed through Sir Rupert's
mind as he stood staring at his friend.</p>

<p>"We heard you were slain in a sea-fight off Sicily," he
repeated.</p>

<p>Cormac shrugged his shoulders. "Many died then, it is true, and
I was struck senseless by a stone from a ballista. Doubtless that
is how the rumor started. But you see me, as much alive as
ever."</p>

<p>"Sit down, old friend." Sir Rupert thrust forward one of the
rude benches which formed part of the tavern's furniture. "What is
forward in the West?"</p>

<p>Cormac took the wine goblet proffered him by a dark-skinned
servitor, and drank deeply.</p>

<p>"Little of note," said he. "In France the king counts his pence
and squabbles with his nobles. Richard&mdash;if he
lives&mdash;languishes somewhere in Germany, 'tis thought. In
England Shane&mdash;that is to say, John&mdash;oppresses the people
and betrays the barons. And in Ireland&mdash;Hell!" He laughed
shortly and without mirth. "What shall I say of Ireland but the
same old tale? Gael and foreigner cut each other's throat and plot
together against the king. John De Coursey, since Hugh de Lacy
supplanted him as governor, has raged like a madman, burning and
pillaging, while Donal O'Brien lurks in the west to destroy what
remains. Yet, by Satan, I think this land is but little
better."</p>

<p>"Yet there is peace of a sort now," murmured Sir Rupert.</p>

<p>"Aye&mdash;peace while the jackal Saladin gathers his powers,"
grunted Cormac. "Think you he will rest idle while Acre, Antioch
and Tripoli remain in Christian hands? He but waits an excuse to
seize the remnants of Outremer."</p>

<p>Sir Rupert shook his head, his eyes shadowed.</p>

<p>"It is a naked land and a bloody one. Were it not akin to
blasphemy I could curse the day I followed my King eastward.
Betimes I dream of the orchards of Normandy, the deep cool forests
and the dreaming vineyards. Methinks my happiest hours were when a
page of twelve years&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At twelve," grunted FitzGeoffrey, "I was running wild with
shock-head kerns on the naked fens&mdash;I wore wolf skins, weighed
near to fourteen stone, and had killed three men."</p>

<p>Sir Rupert looked curiously at his friend. Separated from
Cormac's native land by a width of sea and the breadth of Britain,
the Norman knew but little of the affairs in that far isle. But he
knew vaguely that Cormac's life had not been an easy one. Hated by
the Irish and despised by the Normans, he had paid back contempt
and ill-treatment with savage hate and ruthless vengeance. It was
known that he owned a shadow of allegiance only to the great house
of Fitzgerald, who, as much Welsh as Norman, had even then begun to
take up Irish customs and Irish quarrels.</p>

<p>"You wear another sword than that you wore when I saw you
last."</p>

<p>"They break in my hands," said Cormac. "Three Turkish sabers
went into the forging of the sword I wielded at Joppa&mdash;yet it
shattered like glass in that sea-fight off Sicily. I took this from
the body of a Norse sea-king who led a raid into Munster. It was
forged in Norway&mdash;see the pagan runes on the steel?"</p>

<p>He drew the sword and the great blade shimmered bluely, like a
thing alive in the candle light. The servants crossed themselves
and Sir Rupert shook his head.</p>

<p>"You should not have drawn it here&mdash;they say blood follows
such a sword."</p>

<p>"Bloodshed follows my trail anyway," growled Cormac. "This blade
has already drunk FitzGeoffrey blood&mdash;with this that Norse
sea-king slew my brother, Shane."</p>

<p>"And you wear such a sword?" exclaimed Sir Rupert in horror. "No
good will come of that evil blade, Cormac!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked the big warrior impatiently. "It's a good
blade&mdash;I wiped out the stain of my brother's blood when I slew
his slayer. By Satan, but that sea-king was a grand sight in his
coat of mail with silvered scales. His silvered helmet was strong
too&mdash;ax, helmet and skull shattered together."</p>

<p>"You had another brother, did you not?"</p>

<p>"Aye&mdash;Donal. Eochaidh O'Donnell ate his heart out after the
battle at Coolmanagh. There was a feud between us at the time, so
it may be Eochaidh merely saved me the trouble&mdash;but for all
that I burned the O'Donnell in his own castle."</p>

<p>"How came you to first ride on the Crusade?" asked Sir Rupert
curiously. "Were you stirred with a desire to cleanse your soul by
smiting the Paynim?"</p>

<p>"Ireland was too hot for me," answered the Norman-Gael candidly.
"Lord Shamus MacGearailt&mdash;James Fitzgerald&mdash;wished to
make peace with the English king and I feared he would buy favor by
delivering me into the hands of the king's governor. As there was
feud between my family and most of the Irish clans, there was
nowhere for me to go. I was about to seek my fortune in Scotland
when young Eamonn Fitzgerald was stung by the hornet of Crusade and
I accompanied him."</p>

<p>"But you gained favor with Richard&mdash;tell me the tale."</p>

<p>"Soon told. It was on the plains of Azotus when we came to grips
with the Turks. Aye, you were there! I was fighting alone in the
thick of the fray and helmets and turbans were cracking like eggs
all around when I noted a strong knight in the forefront of our
battle. He cut deeper and deeper into the close- ranked lines of
the heathen and his heavy mace scattered brains like water. But so
dented was his shield and so stained with blood his armor, I could
not tell who he might be.</p>

<p>"But suddenly his horse went down and in an instant he was
hemmed in on all sides by the howling fiends who bore him down by
sheer weight of numbers. So hacking a way to his side I
dismounted&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dismounted?" exclaimed Sir Rupert in amazement.</p>

<p>Cormac's head jerked up in irritation at the interruption. "Why
not?" he snapped. "I am no French she-knight to fear wading in the
muck&mdash;anyway, I fight better on foot. Well, I cleared a space
with a sweep or so of my sword, and the fallen knight, the press
being lightened, came up roaring like a bull and swinging his
blood-clotted mace with such fury he nearly brained <i>me</i> as
well as the Turks. A charge of English knights swept the heathen
away and when he lifted his visor I saw I had succored Richard of
England.</p>

<p>"'Who are you and who is your master?' said he.</p>

<p>"'I am Cormac FitzGeoffrey and I have no master,' said I. 'I
followed young Eamonn Fitzgerald to the Holy Land and since he fell
before the walls of Acre, I seek my fortune alone.'</p>

<p>"'What think ye of me as a master?' asked he, while the battle
raged half a bow-shot about us.</p>

<p>"'You fight reasonably well for a man with Saxon blood in his
veins,' I answered, 'but I own allegiance to no English king.'</p>

<p>"He swore like a trooper. 'By the bones of the saints,' said he,
'that had cost another man his head. You saved my life, but for
this insolence, no prince shall knight you!'</p>

<p>"'Keep your knighthoods and be damned,' said I. 'I am a chief in
Ireland&mdash;but we waste words; yonder are pagan heads to be
smashed.'</p>

<p>"Later he bade me to his royal presence and waxed merry with me;
a rare drinker he is, though a fool withal. But I distrust
kings&mdash;I attached myself to the train of a brave and gallant
young knight of France&mdash;the Sieur Gerard de Gissclin, full of
insane ideals of chivalry, but a noble youth.</p>

<p>"When peace was made between the hosts, I heard hints of a
renewal of strife between the Fitzgeralds and the Le Boteliers, and
Lord Shamus having been slain by Nial Mac Art, and I being in favor
with the king anyway, I took leave of Sieur Gerard and betook
myself back to Erin. Well&mdash;we swept Ormond with torch and
sword and hanged old Sir William le Botelier to his own barbican.
Then, the Geraldines having no particular need of my sword at the
moment, I bethought myself once more of Sieur Gerard, to whom I
owed my life and which debt I have not yet had opportunity to pay.
How, Sir Rupert, dwells he still in his castle of Ali-El-Yar?"</p>

<p>Sir Rupert's face went suddenly white, and he leaned back as if
shrinking from something. Cormac's head jerked up and his dark face
grew more forbidding and fraught with somber potentialities. He
seized the Norman's arm in an unconsciously savage grip.</p>

<p>"Speak, man," he rasped. "What ails you?"</p>

<p>"Sieur Gerard," half-whispered Sir Rupert. "Had you not heard?
Ali-El-Yar lies in smoldering ruins and Gerard is dead."</p>

<p>Cormac snarled like a mad dog, his terrible eyes blazing with a
fearful light. He shook Sir Rupert in the intensity of his
passion.</p>

<p>"Who did the deed? He shall die, were he Emperor of
Byzantium!"</p>

<p>"I know not!" Sir Rupert gasped, his mind half-stunned by the
blast of the Gael's primitive fury. "There be foul
rumors&mdash;Sieur Gerard loved a girl in a sheik's harem, it is
said. A horde of wild riders from the desert assailed his castle
and a rider broke through to ask aid of the baron Conrad Von
Gonler. But Conrad refused&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aye!" snarled Cormac, with a savage gesture. "He hated Gerard
because long ago the youngster had the best of him at sword-play on
shipboard before old Frederick Barbarossa's eyes. And what
then?"</p>

<p>"Ali-El-Yar fell with all its people. Their stripped and
mutilated bodies lay among the coals, but no sign was found of
Gerard. Whether he died before or after the attack on the castle is
not known, but dead he must be, since no demand for ransom has been
made."</p>

<p>"Thus Saladin keeps the peace!"</p>

<p>Sir Rupert, who knew Cormac's unreasoning hatred for the great
Kurdish sultan, shook his head. "This was no work of
his&mdash;there is incessant bickering along the
border&mdash;Christian as much at fault as Moslem. It could not be
otherwise with Frankish barons holding castles in the very heart of
Muhammadan country. There are many private feuds and there are wild
desert and mountain tribes who owe no lordship even to Saladin, and
wage their own wars. Many suppose that the sheik Nureddin El Ghor
destroyed Ali-El-Yar and put Sieur Gerard to death."</p>

<p>Cormac caught up his helmet.</p>

<p>"Wait!" exclaimed Sir Rupert, rising. "What would you do?"</p>

<p>Cormac laughed savagely. "What would I do? I have eaten the
bread of the de Gissclins. Am I a jackal to sneak home and leave my
patron to the kites? Out on it!"</p>

<p>"But wait," Sir Rupert urged. "What will your life be worth if
you ride on Nureddin's trail alone? I will return to Antioch and
gather my retainers; we will avenge your friend together."</p>

<p>"Nureddin is a half-independent chief and I am a masterless
wanderer," rumbled the Norman-Gael, "but you are Seneschal of
Antioch. If you ride over the border with your men-at-arms, the
swine Saladin will take advantage to break the truce and sweep the
remnants of the Christian kingdoms into the sea. They are but weak
shells, as it is, shadows of the glories of Baldwin and Bohemund.
No&mdash;the FitzGeoffreys wreak their own vengeance. I ride
alone."</p>

<p>He jammed his helmet into place and with a gruff "Farewell!" he
turned and strode into the night, roaring for his horse. A
trembling servant brought the great black stallion, which reared
and snorted with a flash of wicked teeth. Cormac seized the reins
and savagely jerked down the rearing steed, swinging into the
saddle before the pawing front hoofs touched earth.</p>

<p>"Hate and the glutting of vengeance!" he yelled savagely, as the
great stallion whirled away, and Sir Rupert, staring bewilderedly
after him, heard the swiftly receding clash of the brazen-shod
hoofs. Cormac FitzGeoffrey was riding east.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="hawks2" name="hawks2">II. &mdash; THE CAST OF AN AX</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">WHITE DAWN surged out of the Orient to
break in rose-red billows on the hills of Outremer. The rich tints
softened the rugged outlines, deepened the blue wastes of the
sleeping desert.</p>

<p>The castle of the baron Conrad Von Gonler frowned out over a
wild and savage waste. Once a stronghold of the Seljuk Turks, its
metamorphosis into the manor of a Frankish lord had abated none of
the Eastern menace of its appearance. The walls had been
strengthened and a barbican built in place of the usual wide gates.
Otherwise the keep had not been altered.</p>

<p>Now in the dawn a grim, dark figure rode up to the deep,
waterless moat which encircled the stronghold, and smote with
iron-clad fist on hollow-ringing shield until the echoes
reverberated among the hills. A sleepy man-at-arms thrust his head
and his pike over the wall above the barbican and bellowed a
challenge.</p>

<p>The lone rider threw back his helmeted head, disclosing a face
dark with a passion that an all-night's ride had not cooled in the
least.</p>

<p>"You keep rare watch here," roared Cormac FitzGeoffrey. "Is it
because you're so hand-in-glove with the Paynim that you fear no
attack? Where is that ale-guzzling swine you call your liege?"</p>

<p>"The baron is at wine," the fellow answered sullenly, in broken
English.</p>

<p>"So early?" marveled Cormac.</p>

<p>"Nay," the other gave a surly grin, "he has feasted all
night."</p>

<p>"Wine-bibber! Glutton!" raged Cormac. "Tell him I have business
with him."</p>

<p>"And what shall I say your business is, Lord FitzGeoffrey?"
asked the carl, impressed.</p>

<p>"Tell him I bring a passport to Hell!" yelled Cormac, gnashing
his teeth, and the scared soldier vanished like a puppet on a
string.</p>

<p>The Norman-Gael sat his horse impatiently, shield slung on his
shoulders, lance in its stirrup socket, and to his surprize,
suddenly the barbican door swung wide and out of it strutted a
fantastic figure. Baron Conrad Von Gonler was short and fat; broad
of shoulder and portly of belly, though still a young man. His long
arms and wide shoulders had gained him a reputation as a deadly
broadsword man, but just now he looked little of the fighter.
Germany and Austria sent many noble knights to the Holy Land. Baron
Von Gonler was not one of them.</p>

<p>His only arm was a gold-chased dagger in a richly brocaded
sheath. He wore no armor, and his costume, flaming with gay silk
and heavy with gold, was a bizarre mingling of European gauds and
Oriental finery. In one hand, on each finger of which sparkled a
great jewel, he held a golden wine goblet. A band of drunken
revelers reeled out behind him&mdash;minnesingers, dwarfs, dancing
girls, wine-companions, vacuous-faced, blinking like owls in the
daylight. All the boot-kissers and hangers-on that swarm after a
rich and degenerate lord trooped with their master&mdash;scum of
both races. The luxury of the East had worked quick ruin on Baron
Von Gonler.</p>

<p>"Well," shouted the baron, "who is it wishes to interrupt my
drinking?"</p>

<p>"Any but a drunkard would know Cormac FitzGeoffrey," snarled the
horseman, his lip writhing back from his strong teeth in contempt.
"We have an account to settle."</p>

<p>That name and Cormac's tone had been enough to sober any drunken
knight of the Outremer. But Von Gonler was not only drunk; he was a
degenerate fool. The baron took a long drink while his drunken crew
stared curiously at the savage figure on the other side of the dry
moat, whispering to one another.</p>

<p>"Once you were a man, Von Gonler," said Cormac in a tone of
concentrated venom; "now you have become a groveling debauchee.
Well, that's your own affair. The matter I have in mind is
another&mdash;why did you refuse aid to the Sieur de Gissclin?"</p>

<p>The German's puffy, arrogant face took on new hauteur. He pursed
his thick lips haughtily, while his bleared eyes blinked over his
bulbous nose like an owl. He was an image of pompous stupidity that
made Cormac grind his teeth.</p>

<p>"What was the Frenchman to me?" the baron retorted brutally. "It
was his own fault&mdash;out of a thousand girls he might have
taken, the young fool tried to steal one a sheik wanted himself.
He, the purity of honor! Bah!"</p>

<p>He added a coarse jest and the creatures with him screamed with
mirth, leaping and flinging themselves into obscene postures.
Cormac's sudden and lion- like roar of fury gave them pause.</p>

<p>"Conrad Von Gonler!" thundered the maddened Gael, "I name you
liar, traitor and coward&mdash;dastard, poltroon and villain! Arm
yourself and ride out here on the plain. And haste&mdash;I can not
waste much time on you&mdash;I must kill you quick and ride on lest
another vermin escape me."</p>

<p>The baron laughed cynically, "Why should I fight you? You are
not even a knight. You wear no knightly emblem on your shield."</p>

<p>"Evasions of a coward," raged FitzGeoffrey. "I am a chief in
Ireland and I have cleft the skulls of men whose boots you are not
worthy to touch. Will you arm yourself and ride out, or are you
become the swinish coward I deem you?"</p>

<p>Von Gonler laughed in scornful anger.</p>

<p>"I need not risk my hide fighting you. I will not fight you, but
I will have my men-at-arms fill your hide with crossbow bolts if
you tarry longer."</p>

<p>"Von Gonler," Cormac's voice was deep and terrible in its
brooding menace, "will you fight, or die in cold blood?"</p>

<p>The German burst into a sudden brainless shout of laughter.</p>

<p>"Listen to him!" he roared. "He threatens me&mdash;he on the
other side of the moat, with the drawbridge lifted&mdash;I here in
the midst of my henchmen!"</p>

<p>He smote his fat thigh and roared with his fool's laughter,
while the debased men and women who served his pleasures laughed
with him and insulted the grim Irish warrior with shrill anathema
and indecent gestures. And suddenly Cormac, with a bitter curse,
rose in his stirrups, snatched his battle-ax from his saddle-bow
and hurled it with all his mighty strength.</p>

<p>The men-at-arms on the towers cried out and the dancing girls
screamed. Von Gonler had thought himself to be out of
reach&mdash;but there is no such thing as being out of reach of
Norman-Irish vengeance. The heavy ax hissed as it clove the air and
dashed out Baron Conrad's brains.</p>

<p>The fat, gross body buckled to the earth like a mass of melted
tallow, one fat, white hand still gripping the empty wine goblet.
The gay silks and cloth-of-gold were dabbled in a deeper red than
ever was sold in the bazaar, and the jesters and dancers scattered
like birds, screaming at the sight of that blasted head and the
crimson ruin that had been a human face.</p>

<p>Cormac FitzGeoffrey made a fierce, triumphant gesture and voiced
a deep- chested yell of such ferocious exultation that men blenched
to hear. Then wheeling his black steed suddenly, he raced away
before the dazed soldiers could get their wits together to send a
shower of arrows after him.</p>

<p>He did not gallop far. The great steed was weary from a hard
night's travel. Cormac soon swung in behind a jutting crag, and
reining his horse up a steep incline, halted and looked back the
way he had come. He was out of sight of the keep, but he heard no
sounds of pursuit. A wait of some half-hour convinced him that no
attempt had been made to follow him. It was dangerous and foolhardy
to ride out of a safe castle into these hills. Cormac might well
have been one of an ambushing force.</p>

<p>At any rate, whatever his enemies' thoughts were on the subject,
it was evident that he need expect no present attempt at
retaliation, and he grunted with angry satisfaction. He never
shunned a fight, but just now he had other business on hand.</p>

<p>Cormac rode eastward.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="hawks3" name="hawks3">III. &mdash; THE ROAD TO EL
GHOR</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">THE WAY to El Ghor was rough indeed.
Cormac wound his way between huge jagged boulders, across deep
ravines and up treacherous steeps. The sun slowly climbed toward
the zenith and the heat waves began to dance and shimmer. The sun
beat fiercely on Cormac's helmeted head, and glancing back from the
bare rocks, dazzled his narrowed eyes. But the big warrior gave no
heed; in his own land he learned to defy sleet and snow and bitter
cold; following the standard of Coeur de Lion, before the
shimmering walls of Acre, on the dusty plains of Azotus, and before
Joppa, he had become inured to the blaze of the Oriental sun, to
the glare of naked sands, to the slashing dust winds.</p>

<p>At noon he halted long enough to allow the black stallion an
hour's rest in the shade of a giant boulder. A tiny spring bubbled
there, known to him of old, and it slaked the thirst of the man and
the horse. The stallion cropped eagerly at the scrawny fringe of
grass about the spring and Cormac ate of the dried meats he carried
in a small pouch. Here he had watered his steed in the old days,
when he rode with Gerard. Ali-El-Yar lay to the west; in the night
he had swung around it in a wide circle as he rode to the castle of
Von Gonler. He had had no wish to gaze on the moldering ruins. The
nearest Moslem chief of any importance was Nureddin El Ghor, who
with his brother-at-arms, Kosru Malik, the Seljuk, held the castle
of El Ghor, in the hills to the east.</p>

<p>Cormac rode on stolidly through the savage heat. As
mid-afternoon neared he rode up out of a deep, wide defile and came
onto the higher levels of the hills. Up this defile he had ridden
aforetime to raid the wild tribes to the east, and on the small
plateaus at the head of the defile stood a gibbet where Sieur
Gerard de Gissclin had once hanged a red-handed Turkoman chief as a
warning to those tribes.</p>

<p>Now, as FitzGeoffrey rode up on the plateau, he saw the old tree
again bore fruit. His keen eyes made out a human form suspended in
midair, apparently by the wrists. A tall warrior in the peaked
helmet and light mail shirt of a Moslem stood beneath, tentatively
prodding at the victim with a spear, making the body sway and spin
on the rope. A bay Turkoman horse stood near. Cormac's cold eyes
narrowed. The man on the rope&mdash;his naked body glistened too
white in the sun for a Turk. The Norman-Gael touched spurs to the
black stallion and swept across the plateau at a headlong run.</p>

<p>At the sudden thunder of hoofs the Muhammadan started and
whirled. Dropping the spear with which he had been tormenting the
captive, he mounted swiftly, stringing a short heavy bow as he did
so. This done, and his left forearm thrust through the straps of a
small round buckler, he trotted out to meet the onset of the
Frank.</p>

<p>Cormac was approaching at a thundering charge, eyes glaring over
the edge of his grim shield. He knew that this Turk would never
meet him as a Frankish knight would have met him&mdash;breast to
breast. The Moslem would avoid his ponderous rushes, and circling
him on his nimbler steed, drive in shaft after shaft until one
found its mark. But he rushed on as recklessly as if he had never
before encountered Saracen tactics.</p>

<p>Now the Turk bent his bow and the arrow glanced from Cormac's
shield. They were barely within javelin cast of each other, but
even as the Moslem laid another shaft to string, doom smote him.
Cormac, without checking his headlong gait, suddenly rose in his
stirrups and gripping his long lance in the middle, cast it like a
javelin. The unexpectedness of the move caught the Seljuk off guard
and he made the mistake of throwing up his shield instead of
dodging. The lance-head tore through the light buckler and crashed
full on his mail-clad breast. The point bent on his hauberk without
piercing the links, but the terrific impact dashed the Turk from
his saddle and as he rose, dazed and groping for his scimitar, the
great black stallion was already looming horrific over him, and
under those frenzied hoofs he went down, torn and shattered.</p>

<p>Without a second glance at his victim Cormac rode under the
gibbet and rising in the saddle, stared into the face of he who
swung therefrom.</p>

<p>"By Satan," muttered the big warrior, "'tis Micaul na
Blaos&mdash;Michael de Blois, one of Gerard's squires. What devil's
work is this?"</p>

<p>Drawing his sword he cut the rope and the youth slid into his
arms. Young Michael's lips were parched and swollen, his eyes dull
with suffering. He was naked except for short leathern breeks, and
the sun had dealt cruelly with his fair skin. Blood from a slight
scalp wound caked his yellow hair, and there were shallow cuts on
his limbs&mdash;marks left by his tormentor's spear.</p>

<p>Cormac laid the young Frenchman in the shade cast by the
motionless stallion and trickled water through the parched lips
from his canteen. As soon as he could speak, Michael croaked: "Now
I know in truth that I am dead, for there is but one knight ever
rode in Outremer who could cast a long lance like a
javelin&mdash;and Cormac FitzGeoffrey has been dead for many
months. But I be dead, where is Gerard&mdash;and Yulala?"</p>

<p>"Rest and be at ease," growled Cormac. "You live&mdash;and so do
I."</p>

<p>He loosed the cords that had cut deep into the flesh of
Michael's wrists and set himself to gently rub and massage the numb
arms. Slowly the delirium faded from the youth's eyes. Like Cormac,
he too came of a race that was tough as spring steel; an hour's
rest and plenty of water, and his intense vitality asserted
itself.</p>

<p>"How long have you hung from this gibbet?" asked Cormac.</p>

<p>"Since dawn." Michael's eyes were grim as he rubbed his
lacerated wrists. "Nureddin and Kosru Malik said that since Sieur
Gerard once hanged one of their race here, it was fitting that one
of Gerard's men should grace this gibbet."</p>

<p>"Tell me how Gerard died," growled the Irish warrior. "Men hint
at foul tales&mdash;"</p>

<p>Michael's fine eyes filled with tears. "Ah, Cormac, I who loved
him, brought about his death. Listen&mdash;there is more to this
than meets the casual eye. I think that Nureddin and his
comrade-at-arms have been stung by the hornet of empire. It is in
my mind that they, with various dog-knights among the Franks, dream
of a mongrel kingdom among these hills, which shall hold allegiance
neither to Saladin nor any king of the West.</p>

<p>"They begin to broaden their holdings by treachery. The nearest
Christian hold was that of Ali-El-Yar, of course. Sieur Gerard was
a true knight, peace be upon his fair soul, and he must be removed.
All this I learned later&mdash;would to God I had known it
beforehand! Among Nureddin's slaves is a Persian girl named Yulala,
and with this innocent tool of their evil wishes, the twain sought
to ensnare my lord&mdash;to slay at once his body and his good
name. And God help me, through me they succeeded where otherwise
they had failed.</p>

<p>"For my lord Gerard was honorable beyond all men. When in peace,
and at Nureddin's invitation, he visited El Ghor, he paid no heed
to Yulala's blandishments. For according to the commands of her
masters, which she dared not disobey, the girl allowed Gerard to
look on her, unveiled, as if by chance, and she pretended affection
for him. But Gerard gave her no heed. But I&mdash;I fell victim to
her charms."</p>

<p>Cormac snorted in disgust. Michael clutched his arm.</p>

<p>"Cormac," he cried, "bethink you&mdash;all men are not iron like
you! I swear I loved Yulala from the moment I first set eyes on
her&mdash;and she loved me! I contrived to see her again&mdash;to
steal into El Ghor itself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whence men got the tale that it was Gerard who was carrying on
an affair with Nureddin's slave," snarled FitzGeoffrey.</p>

<p>Michael hid his face in his hands. "Mine the fault," he groaned.
"Then one night a mute brought a note signed by
Yulala&mdash;apparently&mdash;begging me to come with Sieur Gerard
and his men-at-arms and save her from a frightful fate&mdash;our
love had been discovered, the note read, and they were about to
torture her. I was wild with rage and fear. I went to Gerard and
told him all, and he, white soul of honor, vowed to aid me. He
could not break the truce and bring Saladin's wrath upon the
Christian's cities, but he donned his mail and rode forth alone
with me. We would see if there was any way whereby we might steal
Yulala away, secretly; if not, my lord would go boldly to Nureddin
and ask the girl as a gift, or offer to pay a great ransom for her.
I would marry her.</p>

<p>"Well, when we reached the place outside the wall of El Ghor,
where I was wont to meet Yulala, we found we were trapped.
Nureddin, Kosru Malik and their warriors rose suddenly about us on
all sides. Nureddin first spoke to Gerard, telling him of the trap
he had set and baited, hoping to entice my lord into his power
alone. And the Moslem laughed to think that the chance love of a
squire had drawn Gerard into the trap where the carefully wrought
plan had failed. As for the missive&mdash;Nureddin wrote that
himself, believing, in his craftiness, that Sieur Gerard would do
just as indeed he did.</p>

<p>"Nureddin and the Turk offered to allow Gerard to join them in
their plan of empire. They told him plainly that his castle and
lands were the price a certain powerful nobleman asked in return
for his alliance, and they offered alliance with Gerard instead of
this noble. Sieur Gerard merely answered that so long as life
remained in him, he would keep faith with his king and his creed,
and at the word the Moslems rolled on us like a wave.</p>

<p>"Ah, Cormac, Cormac, had you but been there with our
men-at-arms! Gerard bore himself right manfully as was his
wont&mdash;back to back we fought and I swear to you that we trod a
knee-deep carpet of the dead before Gerard fell and they dragged me
down. 'Christ and the Cross!' were his last words, as the Turkish
spears and swords pierced him through and through. And his fair
body&mdash;naked and gashed, and thrown to the kites and the
jackals!"</p>

<p>Michael sobbed convulsively, beating his fists together in his
agony. Cormac rumbled deep in his chest like a savage bull. Blue
lights burned and flickered in his eyes.</p>

<p>"And you?" he asked harshly.</p>

<p>"Me they flung into a dungeon for torture," answered Michael,
"but that night Yulala came to me. An old servitor who loved her,
and who had dwelt in El Ghor before it fell to Nureddin, freed me
and led us both through a secret passage that leads from the
torture chamber, beyond the wall. We went into the hills on foot
and without weapons and wandered there for days, hiding from the
horsemen sent forth to hunt us down. Yesterday we were recaptured
and brought back to El Ghor. An arrow had struck down the old slave
who showed us the passageway, unknown to the present masters of the
castle, and we refused to tell how we had escaped though Nureddin
threatened us with torture. This dawn he brought me forth from the
castle and hanged me to this gibbet, leaving that one to guard me.
What he has done to Yulala, God alone knows."</p>

<p>"You knew that Ali-El-Yar had fallen?"</p>

<p>"Aye," Michael nodded dully. "Kosru Malik boasted of it. The
lands of Gerard now fall heir to his enemy, the traitor knight who
will come to Nureddin's aid when the Moslem strikes for a
crown."</p>

<p>"And who is this traitor?" asked Cormac softly.</p>

<p>"The baron Conrad Von Gonler, whom I swear to spit like a
hare&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cormac smiled thinly and bleakly. "Swear me no oaths. Von Gonler
has been in Hell since dawn. I knew only that he refused to come to
Gerard's aid. I could have slain him no deader had I known his
whole infamy."</p>

<p>Michael's eyes blazed. "A de Gissclin to the rescue!" he shouted
fiercely. "I thank thee, old war-dog! One traitor is accounted
for&mdash;what now? Shall Nureddin and the Turk live while two men
wear de Gissclin steel?"</p>

<p>"Not if steel cuts and blood runs red," snarled Cormac. "Tell me
of this secret way&mdash;nay, waste no time in words&mdash;show
<i>me</i> this secret way. If you escaped thereby, why should we
not enter the same way? Here&mdash;take the arms from that carrion
while I catch his steed which I see browses on the moss among the
rocks. Night is not far away; mayhap we can gain through to the
interior of the castle&mdash;there&mdash;"</p>

<p>His big hands clenched into iron sledges and his terrible eyes
blazed; in his whole bearing there was apparent a plain tale of
fire and carnage, of spears piercing bosoms and swords splitting
skulls.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="hawks4" name="hawks4">IV. &mdash; THE FAITH OF
CORMAC</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">WHEN Cormac FitzGeoffrey took up the trail
to El Ghor again, one would have thought at a glance that a Turk
rode with him. Michael de Blois rode the bay Turkoman steed and
wore the peaked Turkish helmet. He was girt with the curved
scimitar and carried the bow and quiver of arrows, but he did not
wear the mail shirt; the hammering hoofs of the plunging stallion
had battered and brayed it out of all usefulness.</p>

<p>The companions took a circuitous route into the hills to avoid
outposts, and it was dusk before they looked down on the towers of
El Ghor which stood, grim and sullen, girt on three sides by
scowling hills. Westward a broad road wound down the steeps on
which the castle stood. On all other sides ravine-cut slopes
straggled to the beetling walls. They had made such a wide circle
that they now stood in the hills almost directly east of the keep,
and Cormac, gazing westward over the turrets, spoke suddenly to his
friend.</p>

<p>"Look&mdash;a cloud of dust far out on the plain&mdash;"</p>

<p>Michael shook his head: "Your eyes are far keener than mine. The
hills are so clouded with the blue shadows of twilight I can
scarcely make out the blurred expanse that is the plain beyond,
much less discern any movement upon it."</p>

<p>"My life has often depended on my eyesight," growled the
Norman-Gael. "Look closely&mdash;see that tongue of plainsland that
cleaves far into the hills like a broad valley, to the north? A
band of horsemen, riding hard, are just entering the defiles, if I
may judge by the cloud of dust they raise. Doubtless a band of
raiders returning to El Ghor. Well&mdash;they are in the hills now
where going is rough and it will be hours before they get to the
castle. Let us to our task&mdash;stars are blinking in the
east."</p>

<p>They tied their horses in a place hidden from sight of any
watcher below down among the gullies. In the last dim light of dusk
they saw the turbans of the sentries on the towers, but gliding
among boulders and defiles, they kept well concealed. At last
Michael turned into a deep ravine.</p>

<p>"This leads into the subterranean corridor," said he. "God grant
it has not been discovered by Nureddin. He had his warriors
searching for something of the sort, suspecting its existence when
we refused to tell how we had escaped."</p>

<p>They passed along the ravine, which grew narrower and deeper,
for some distance, feeling their way; then Michael halted with a
groan. Cormac, groping forward, felt iron bars, and as his eyes
grew accustomed to the darkness, made out an opening like the mouth
of a cave. Solid iron sills had been firmly bolted into the solid
rock, and into these sills were set heavy bars, too close together
to allow the most slender human to slip through.</p>

<p>"They have found the tunnel and closed it," groaned Michael.
"Cormac, what are we to do?"</p>

<p>Cormac came closer and laid hands tentatively on the bars. Night
had fallen and it was so dark in the ravine even his catlike eyes
could hardly make out objects close at hand. The big Norman-Celt
took a deep breath, and gripping a bar in each mighty hand, braced
his iron legs and slowly exerted all his incredible strength.
Michael, watching in amazement, sensed rather than saw the great
muscles roll and swell under the pliant mail, the veins swell in
the giant's forehead and sweat burst out. The bars groaned and
creaked, and even as Michael remembered that this man was stronger
than King Richard himself, the breath burst from Cormac's lips in
an explosive grunt and simultaneously the bars gave way like reeds
in his iron hands. One came away, literally torn from its sockets,
and the others bent deeply. Cormac gasped and shook the sweat out
of his eyes, tossing the bar aside.</p>

<p>"By the saints," muttered Michael, "are you man or devil, Cormac
FitzGeoffrey? That is a feat I deemed even beyond your power."</p>

<p>"Enough words," grunted the Norman. "Let us make haste, if we
can squeeze through. It's likely that we'll find a guard in this
tunnel, but it's a chance we must take. Draw your steel and follow
me."</p>

<p>It was as dark as the maw of Hades in the tunnel. They groped
their way forward, expecting every minute to blunder into a trap,
and Michael, stealing close at the heels of his friend, cursed the
pounding of his own heart and wondered at the ability of the giant
to move stealthily and with no rattling of arms.</p>

<p>To the comrades it seemed that they groped forward in the
darkness for an eternity, and just as Michael leaned forward to
whisper that he believed they were inside the castle's outer walls,
a faint glow was observed ahead. Stealing warily forward they came
to a sharp turn in the corridor around which shone the light.
Peering cautiously about the corner they saw that the light
emanated from a flickering torch thrust into a niche in the wall,
and beside this stood a tall Turk, yawning as he leaned on his
spear. Two other Moslems lay sleeping on their cloaks nearby.
Evidently Nureddin did not lay too much trust in the bars with
which he had blocked the entrance.</p>

<p>"The guard," whispered Michael, and Cormac nodded, stepping back
and drawing his companion with him. The Norman-Gael's wary eyes had
made out a flight of stone steps beyond the warriors, with a heavy
door at the top.</p>

<p>"These seem to be all the weapon-men in the tunnel," muttered
Cormac. "Loose a shaft at the waking warrior&mdash;and do not
miss."</p>

<p>Michael fitted notch to string, and leaning close to the angle
of the turn, aimed at the Turk's throat, just above the hauberk. He
silently cursed the flickering, illusive light. Suddenly the drowsy
warrior's head jerked up and he glared in their direction,
suspicion flaring his eyes. Simultaneously came the twang of the
loosed string and the Turk staggered and went down, gurgling
horribly and clawing at the shaft that transfixed his bull
neck.</p>

<p>The other two, awakened by their comrade's death throes and the
sudden swift drum of feet on the ground, started up&mdash;and were
cut down as they rubbed at sleep-filled eyes and groped for
weapons.</p>

<p>"That was well done," growled Cormac, shaking the red drops from
his steel. "There was no sound that should have carried through
yonder door. Still, if it be bolted from within, our work is
useless and we undone."</p>

<p>But it was not bolted, as the presence of the warriors in the
tunnel suggested. As Cormac gently opened the heavy iron door, a
sudden pain-fraught whimper from the other side electrified
them.</p>

<p>"Yulala!" gasped Michael, whitening. "'Tis the torture chamber,
and that is her voice! In God's name, Cormac&mdash;in!"</p>

<p>And the big Norman-Gael recklessly flung the door wide and
leaped through like a charging tiger, with Michael at his heels.
They halted short. It was the torture chamber, right enough, and on
the floor and the walls stood or hung all the hellish appliances
that the mind of man has invented for the torment of his brother.
Three people were in the dungeon and two of these were
bestial-faced men in leathern breeches, who looked up, startled, as
the Franks entered. The third was a girl who lay bound to a sort of
bench, naked as the day she was born. Coals glowed in braziers
nearby, and one of the mutes was in the very act of reaching for a
pair of white-hot pinchers. He crouched now, glaring in amazement,
his arm still outstretched.</p>

<p>From the white throat of the captive girl burst a piteous
cry.</p>

<p>"Yulala!" Michael cried out fiercely and leaped forward, a red
mist floating before his eyes. One of the beast-faced mutes was
before him, lifting a short sword, but the young Frank, without
checking his stride, brought down his scimitar in a sweeping arc
that drove the curved blade through scalp and skull. Wrenching his
weapon free, he dropped to his knees beside the torture bench, a
great sob tearing his throat.</p>

<p>"Yulala! Yulala! Oh girl, what have they done to you?"</p>

<p>"Michael, my beloved!" Her great dark eyes were like stars in
the mist. "I knew you would come. They have not tortured
me&mdash;save for a whipping&mdash;they were just about to
begin&mdash;"</p>

<p>The other mute had glided swiftly toward Cormac as a snake
glides, knife in hand.</p>

<p>"Satan!" grunted the big warrior. "I won't sully my steel with
such blood&mdash;"</p>

<p>His left hand shot out and caught the mute's wrist and there was
a crunch of splintering bones. The knife flew from the mute's
fingers, which spread wide suddenly like an inflated glove. Blood
burst from the fingertips and the creature's mouth gaped in silent
agony. And at that instant Cormac's right hand closed on his throat
and through the open lips burst a red deluge of blood as the
Norman's iron fingers ground flesh and vertebrae to a crimson
pulp.</p>

<p>Flinging aside the sagging corpse, Cormac turned to Michael, who
had freed the girl and now was nearly crushing her in his arms as
he gripped her close in a very passion of relief and joy. A heavy
hand on his shoulder brought him back to a realization of their
position. Cormac had found a cloak and this he wrapped about the
naked girl.</p>

<p>"Go, at once," he said swiftly. "It may not be long before
others come to take the place of the guards in the tunnel.
Here&mdash;you have no armor&mdash;take my shield&mdash;no, don't
argue. You may need it to protect the girl from arrows if
you&mdash;if we, are pursued. Haste now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you, Cormac?" Michael lingered, hesitant.</p>

<p>"I will make fast that outer door," said the Norman. "I can heap
benches against it. Then I will follow you. But don't wait for me.
This is a command, do you understand? Hasten through the tunnel and
go to the horses. There, instantly mount the Turkoman horse and
ride! I will follow by another route&mdash;aye, by a road none but
I can ride! Ride ye to Sir Rupert de Vaile, Seneschal of Antioch.
He is our friend; hasten now."</p>

<p>Cormac stood a moment in the doorway at the head of the stairs
and watched Michael and the girl hurry down the steps, past the
place where the silent sentries lay, and vanish about the turn in
the tunnel. Then he turned back into the torture chamber and closed
the door. He crossed the room, threw the bolt on the outer door and
swung it wide. He gazed up a winding flight of stairs. Cormac's
face was immobile. He had voluntarily sealed his doom.</p>

<p>The giant Norman-Celt was an opportunist. He knew that such
chance as had led him into the heart of his foe's stronghold was
not likely to favor him again. Life was uncertain in Outremer; if
he waited for another opportunity to strike at Nureddin and Kosru
Malik, that opportunity might not come. This was his best
opportunity for the vengeance for which his barbaric soul
lusted.</p>

<p>That he would lose his own life in the consummating of that
vengeance made no difference. Men were born to die in battle,
according to his creed, and Cormac FitzGeoffrey secretly leaned
toward the belief of his Viking ancestors in a Valhalla for the
souls loosed gloriously in the clash of swords. Michael, having
found the girl, had instantly forgotten the original plan of
vengeance. Cormac had no blame for him; life and love were sweet to
the young. But the grim Irish warrior owed a debt to the murdered
Gerard and was prepared to pay with his own life. Thus Cormac kept
faith with the dead.</p>

<p>He wished that he could have bade Michael ride the black
stallion, but he knew that the horse would allow none but himself
to bestride it. Now it would fall into Moslem hands, he thought
with a sigh. He went up the stairs.</p>

<h2><a id="hawks5" name="hawks5">V. &mdash; THE LION OF ISLAM</a>
</h2>

<p>At the top of the stairs, Cormac came into a corridor and along
this he strode swiftly but warily, the Norse sword shimmering
bluely in his hand. Going at random he turned into another corridor
and here came full on a Turkish warrior, who stopped short, agape,
seeing a supernatural horror in this grim slayer who strode like a
silent phantom of death through the castle. Before the Turk could
regain his wits, the blue sword shore through his neck cords.</p>

<p>Cormac stood above his victim for a moment, listening intently.
Somewhere ahead of him he heard a low hum of voices, and the
attitude of this Turk, with shield and drawn scimitar, had
suggested that he stood guard before some chamber door. An
irregular torch faintly illumined the wide corridor, and Cormac,
groping in the semidarkness for a door, found instead a wide portal
masked by heavy silk curtains. Parting them cautiously he gazed
through into a great room thronged with armed men.</p>

<p>Warriors in mail and peaked helmets, and bearing wide-pointed,
curved swords, lined the walls, and on silken cushions sat the
chieftains&mdash;rulers of El Ghor and their satellites. Across the
room sat Nureddin El Ghor, tall, lean, with a high-bridged, thin
nose and keen dark eyes; his whole aspect distinctly hawk-like. His
Semitic features contrasted with the Turks about him. His lean
strong hand continually caressed the ivory hilt of a long, lean
saber, and he wore a shirt of mesh-mail. A renegade chief from
southern Arabia, this sheik was a man of great ability; his dream
of an independent kingdom in these hills was no mad hashish
hallucination. Let him win the alliance of a few Seljuk chiefs, of
a few Frankish renegades like Von Gonler, and with the hordes of
Arabs, Turks and Kurds that would assuredly flock to his banner,
Nureddin would be a menace both to Saladin and the Franks who still
clung to the fringes of Outremer. Among the mailed Turks Cormac saw
the sheepskin caps and wolf skins of wild chiefs from beyond the
hills&mdash;Kurds and Turkomans. Already the Arab's fame was
spreading, if such unstable warriors as these were rallying to
him.</p>

<p>Near the curtain-hung doorway sat Kosru Malik, known to Cormac
of old, a warrior typical of his race, strongly built, of medium
height, with a dark cruel face. Even as he sat in council he wore a
peaked helmet and a gilded mail hauberk and held across his knees a
jeweled-hilted scimitar. It seemed to Cormac that these men argued
some matter just before setting out on some raid, as they were all
fully armed. But he wasted no time on speculation. He tore the
hangings aside with a mailed hand and strode into the room.</p>

<p>Amazement held the warriors frozen for an instant, and in that
instant the giant Frank reached Kosru Malik's side. The Turk, his
dark features paling, sprang to his feet like a steel spring
released, raising his scimitar, but even as he did so, Cormac
braced his feet and smote with all his power. The Norse sword
shivered the curved blade and, rending the gilded mail, severed the
Turk's shoulder-bone and cleft his breast.</p>

<p>Cormac wrenched the heavy blade free from the split breastbone
and with one foot on Kosru Malik's body, faced his foes like a lion
at bay. His helmeted head was lowered, his cold blue eyes flaming
from under the heavy black brows, and his mighty right hand held
ready the stained sword. Nureddin had leaped to his feet and stood
trembling in rage and astonishment. This sudden apparition came as
near to unmanning him as anything had ever done. His thin,
hawk-like features lowered in a wrathful snarl, his beard bristled
and with a quick motion he unsheathed his ivory-hilted saber. Then
even as he stepped forward and his warriors surged in behind him, a
startling interruption occurred.</p>

<p>Cormac, a fierce joy surging in him as he braced himself for the
charge, saw, on the other side of the great room, a wide door swing
open and a host of armed warriors appear, accompanied by sundry of
Nureddin's men, who wore empty scabbards and uneasy faces.</p>

<p>The Arab and his warriors whirled to face the newcomers. These
men, Cormac saw, were dusty as if from long riding, and his memory
flashed to the horsemen he had seen riding into the hills at dusk.
Before them strode a tall, slender man, whose fine face was traced
with lines of weariness, but whose aspect was that of a ruler of
men. His garb was simple in comparison with the resplendent armor
and silken attendants. And Cormac swore in amazed recognition.</p>

<p>Yet his surprize was no greater than that of the men of El
Ghor.</p>

<p>"What do you in my castle, unannounced?" gasped Nureddin.</p>

<p>A giant in silvered mail raised his hand warningly and spoke
sonorously: "The Lion of Islam, Protector of the Faithful, Yussef
Ibn Eyyub, Salah-ud-din, Sultan of Sultans, needs no announcement
to enter yours or any castle, Arab."</p>

<p>Nureddin stood his ground, though his followers began salaaming
madly; there was iron in this Arabian renegade.</p>

<p>"My lord," said he stoutly, "it is true I did not recognize you
when you first came into the chamber; but El Ghor is mine, not by
virtue of right or aid or grant from any sultan, but the might of
my own arm. Therefore, I make you welcome but do not beg your mercy
for my hasty words."</p>

<p>Saladin merely smiled in a weary way. Half a century of intrigue
and warring rested heavily on his shoulders. His brown eyes,
strangely mild for so great a lord, rested on the silent Frankish
giant who still stood with his mail- clad foot on what had been the
chief Kosru Malik.</p>

<p>"And what is this?" asked the Sultan.</p>

<p>Nureddin scowled: "A Nazarene outlaw has stolen into my keep and
assassinated my comrade, the Seljuk. I beg your leave to dispose of
him. I will give you his skull, set in silver&mdash;"</p>

<p>A gesture stopped him. Saladin stepped past his men and
confronted the dark, brooding warrior.</p>

<p>"I thought I had recognized those shoulders and that dark face,"
said the Sultan with a smile. "So you have turned your face east
again, Lord Cormac?"</p>

<p>"Enough!" The deep voice of the Norman-Irish giant filled the
chamber. "You have me in your trap; my life is forfeit. Waste not
your time in taunts; send your jackals against me and make an end
of it. I swear by my clan, many of them shall bite the dust before
I die, and the dead will be more than the living!"</p>

<p>Nureddin's tall frame shook with passion; he gripped his hilt
until the knuckles showed white. "Is this to be borne, my Lord?" he
exclaimed fiercely. "Shall this Nazarene dog fling dirt into our
faces&mdash;"</p>

<p>Saladin shook his head slowly, smiling as if at some secret
jest: "It may be his is no idle boast. At Acre, at Azotus, at Joppa
I have seen the skull on his shield glitter like a star of death in
the mist, and the Faithful fall before his sword like garnered
grain."</p>

<p>The great Kurd turned his head, leisurely surveying the ranks of
silent warriors and the bewildered chieftains who avoided his level
gaze.</p>

<p>"A notable concourse of chiefs, for these times of truce," he
murmured, half to himself. "Would you ride forth in the night with
all these warriors to fight genii in the desert, or to honor some
ghostly sultan, Nureddin? Nay, nay, Nureddin, thou hast tasted the
cup of ambition, meseemeth&mdash;and thy life is forfeit!"</p>

<p>The unexpectedness of the accusation staggered Nureddin, and
while he groped for a reply, Saladin followed it up: "It comes to
me that you have plotted against me&mdash;aye, that it was your
purpose to seduce various Moslem and Frankish lords from their
allegiances, and set up a kingdom of your own. And for that reason
you broke the truce and murdered a good knight, albeit a Caphar,
and burned his castle. I have spies, Nureddin."</p>

<p>The tall Arab glanced quickly about, as if ready to dispute the
question with Saladin himself. But when he noted the number of the
Kurd's warriors, and saw his own fierce ruffians shrinking away
from him, awed, a smile of bitter contempt crossed his hawk-like
features, and sheathing his blade, he folded his arms.</p>

<p>"God gives," he said simply, with the fatalism of the
Orient.</p>

<p>Saladin nodded in appreciation, but motioned back a chief who
stepped forward to bind the sheik. "Here is one," said the Sultan,
"to whom you owe a greater debt than to me, Nureddin. I have heard
Cormac FitzGeoffrey was brother- at-arms to the Sieur Gerard. You
owe many debts of blood, oh Nureddin; pay one, therefore, by facing
the lord Cormac with the sword."</p>

<p>The Arab's eyes gleamed suddenly. "And if I slay him&mdash;shall
I go free?"</p>

<p>"Who am I to judge?" asked Saladin. "It shall be as Allah wills
it. But if you fight the Frank you will die, Nureddin, even though
you slay him; he comes of a breed that slays even in their
death-throes. Yet it is better to die by the sword than by the
cord, Nureddin."</p>

<p>The sheik's answer was to draw his ivory-hilted saber. Blue
sparks flickered in Cormac's eyes and he rumbled deeply like a
wounded lion. He hated Saladin as he hated all his race, with the
savage and relentless hatred of the Norman-Celt. He had ascribed
the Kurd's courtesy to King Richard and the Crusaders to Oriental
subtlety, refusing to believe that there could be ought but
trickery and craftiness in a Saracen's mind. Now he saw in the
Sultan's suggestion but the scheming of a crafty trickster to match
two of his foes against each other, and a feline-like gloating over
his victims. Cormac grinned without mirth. He asked no more from
life than to have his enemy at sword- points. But he felt no
gratitude toward Saladin, only a smoldering hate.</p>

<p>The Sultan and the warriors gave back, leaving the rivals a
clear space in the center of the great room. Nureddin came forward
swiftly, having donned a plain round steel cap with a mail drop
that fell about his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Death to you, Nazarene!" he yelled, and sprang in with the
pantherish leap and headlong recklessness of an Arab's attack.
Cormac had no shield. He parried the hacking saber with upflung
blade, and slashed back. Nureddin caught the heavy blade on his
round buckler, which he turned slightly slantwise at the instant of
impact, so that the stroke glanced off. He returned the blow with a
thrust that rasped against Cormac's coif, and leaped a spear's
length backward to avoid the whistling sweep of the Norse
sword.</p>

<p>Again he leaped in, slashing, and Cormac caught the saber on his
left forearm. Mail links parted beneath the keen edge, and blood
spattered, but almost simultaneously the Norse sword crashed under
the Arab's arm, bones cracked and Nureddin was flung his full
length to the floor. Warriors gasped as they realized the full
power of the Irishman's tigerish strokes.</p>

<p>Nureddin's rise from the floor was so quick that he almost
seemed to rebound from his fall. To the onlookers it seemed that he
was not hurt, but the Arab knew. His mail had held; the sword edge
had not gashed his flesh, but the impact of that terrible blow had
snapped a rib like a rotten twig, and the realization that he could
not long avoid the Frank's rushes filled him with a wild beast
determination to take his foe with him to Eternity.</p>

<p>Cormac was looming over Nureddin, sword high, but the Arab
nerving himself to a dynamic burst of superhuman quickness, sprang
up as a cobra leaps from its coil, and struck with desperate power.
Full on Cormac's bent head the whistling saber clashed, and the
Frank staggered as the keen edge bit through steel cap and coif
links into his scalp. Blood jetted down his face, but he braced his
feet and struck back with all the power of arm and shoulders behind
the sword. Again Nureddin's buckler blocked the stroke, but this
time the Arab had no time to turn the shield, and the heavy blade
struck squarely. Nureddin went to his knees beneath the stroke,
bearded face twisted in agony. With tenacious courage he reeled up
again, shaking the shattered buckler from his numbed and broken
arm, but even as he lifted the saber, the Norse sword crashed down,
cleaving the Moslem helmet and splitting the skull to the
teeth.</p>

<p>Cormac set a foot on his fallen foe and wrenched free his gory
sword. His fierce eyes met the whimsical gaze of Saladin.</p>

<p>"Well, Saracen," said the Irish warrior challengingly, "I have
killed your rebel for you."</p>

<p>"And your enemy," reminded Saladin.</p>

<p>"Aye," Cormac grinned bleakly and ferociously. "I thank
you&mdash;though well I know it was no love of me or mine that
prompted you to send the Arab against me. Well&mdash;make an end,
Saracen."</p>

<p>"Why do you hate me, Lord Cormac?" asked the Sultan
curiously.</p>

<p>Cormac snarled. "Why do I hate any of my foes? You are no more
and no less than any other robber chief, to me. You tricked Richard
and the rest with courtly words and fine deeds, but you never
deceived me, who well knew you sought to win by deceit where you
could not gain by force of arms."</p>

<p>Saladin shook his head, murmuring to himself. Cormac glared at
him, tensing himself for a sudden leap that would carry the Kurd
with him into the Dark. The Norman-Gael was a product of his age
and his country; among the warring chiefs of blood-drenched
Ireland, mercy was unknown and chivalry an outworn and forgotten
myth. Kindness to a foe was a mark of weakness; courtesy to an
enemy a form of craft, a preparation for treachery; to such
teachings had Cormac grown up, in a land where a man took every
advantage, gave no quarter and fought like a blood-mad devil if he
expected to survive.</p>

<p>Now at a gesture from Saladin, those crowding the door gave
back.</p>

<p>"Your way is open, Lord Cormac."</p>

<p>The Gael glared, his eyes narrowing to slits: "What game is
this?" he growled. "Shall I turn my back to your blades? Out on
it!"</p>

<p>"All swords are in their sheaths," answered the Kurd. "None
shall harm you."</p>

<p>Cormac's lion-like head swung from side to side as he glared at
the Moslems.</p>

<p>"You honestly mean I am to go free, after breaking the truce and
slaying your jackals?"</p>

<p>"The truce was already broken," answered Saladin. "I find in you
no fault. You have repaid blood for blood, and kept your faith to
the dead. You are rough and savage, but I would fain have men like
you in mine own train. There is a fierce loyalty in you, and for
this I honor you."</p>

<p>Cormac sheathed his sword ungraciously. A grudging admiration
for this weary-faced Moslem was born in him and it angered him.
Dimly he realized at last that this attitude of fairness, justice
and kindliness, even to foes, was not a crafty pose of Saladin's,
not a manner of guile, but a natural nobility of the Kurd's nature.
He saw suddenly embodied in the Sultan, the ideals of chivalry and
high honor so much talked of&mdash;and so little practiced&mdash;by
the Frankish knights. Blondel had been right then, and Sieur
Gerard, when they argued with Cormac that high-minded chivalry was
no mere romantic dream of an outworn age, but had existed, and
still existed and lived in the hearts of certain men. But Cormac
was born and bred in a savage land where men lived the desperate
existence of the wolves whose hides covered their nakedness. He
suddenly realized his own innate barbarism and was ashamed. He
shrugged his lion's shoulders.</p>

<p>"I have misjudged you, Moslem," he growled. "There is fairness
in you."</p>

<p>"I thank you, Lord Cormac," smiled Saladin. "Your road to the
west is clear."</p>

<p>And the Moslem warriors courteously salaamed as Cormac
FitzGeoffrey strode from the royal presence of the slender noble
who was Protector of the Califs, Lion of Islam, Sultan of
Sultans.</p>
