<h2><a id="sowers1" name="sowers1">CHAPTER 1</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE IDLERS in the tavern glanced up at the figure
framed in the doorway. It was a tall broad man who stood there,
with the torch-lit shadows and the clamor of the bazaars at his
back. His garments were simple tunic, and short breeches of
leather; a camel's-hair mantle hung from his broad shoulders and
sandals were on his feet. But belying the garb of the peaceful
traveler, a short straight stabbing sword hung at his girdle. One
massive arm, ridged with muscles, was outstretched, the brawny hand
gripping a pilgrim's staff, as the man stood, powerful legs wide
braced, in the doorway. His bare legs were hairy, knotted like tree
trunks. His coarse red locks were confined by a single band of blue
cloth, and from his square dark face, his strange blue eyes blazed
with a kind of reckless and wayward mirth, reflected by the
half-smile that curved his thin lips.</p>

<p>His glance passed over the hawk-faced seafarers and ragged
loungers who brewed tea and squabbled endlessly, to rest on a man
who sat apart at a rough-hewn table, with a wine pitcher. Such a
man the watcher in the door had never seen&mdash;tall, deep
chested, broad shouldered, built with the dangerous suppleness of a
panther. His eyes were as cold as blue ice, set off by a mane of
golden hair tinted with red; so to the man in the doorway that hair
seemed like burning gold. The man at the table wore a light shirt
of silvered mail, a long lean sword hung at his hip, and on the
bench beside him lay a kite-shaped shield and a light helmet.</p>

<p>The man in the guise of a traveler strode purposefully forward
and halted, hands resting on the table across which he smiled
mockingly at the other, and spoke in a tongue strange to the seated
man, newly come to the East.</p>

<p>The one turned to an idler and asked in Norman French: "What
does the infidel say?"</p>

<p>"I said," replied the traveler in the same tongue, "that a man
can not even enter an Egyptian inn these days without finding some
dog of a Christian under his feet."</p>

<p>As the traveler had spoken the other had risen, and now the
speaker dropped his hand to his sword. Scintillant lights flickered
in the other's eyes and he moved like a flash of summer lightning.
His left hand darted out to lock in the breast of the traveler's
tunic, and in his right hand the long sword flashed out. The
traveler was caught flat-footed, his sword half clear of its
sheath. But the faint smile did not leave his lips and he stared
almost childishly at the blade that flickered before his eyes, as
if fascinated by its dazzling.</p>

<p>"Heathen dog," snarled the swordsman, and his voice was like the
slash of a blade through fabric, "I'll send you to Hell
unshriven!"</p>

<p>"What panther whelped you that you move as a cat strikes?"
responded the other curiously, as calmly as if his life were not
weighing in the balance. "But you took me by surprize. I did not
know that a Frank dare draw sword in Damietta."</p>

<p>The Frank glared at him moodily; the wine he had drunk showed in
the dangerous gleams that played in his eyes where lights and
shadows continuously danced and shifted.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Haroum the Traveler," the other grinned. "Put up your steel. I
crave pardon for my gibing words. It seems there are Franks of the
old breed yet."</p>

<p>With a change of mood the Frank thrust his sword back into its
sheath with an impatient clash. Turning back to his bench he
indicated table and wine pitcher with a sweeping gesture.</p>

<p>"Sit and refresh yourself; if you are a traveler, you have a
tale to tell."</p>

<p>Haroun did not at once comply. His gaze swept the inn and he
beckoned the innkeeper, who came grudgingly forward. As he
approached the Traveler, the innkeeper suddenly shrank back with a
low half-stifled cry. Haroun's eyes went suddenly merciless and he
said, "What then, host, do you see in me a man you have known
aforetime, perchance?"</p>

<p>His voice was like the purr of a hunting tiger and the wretched
innkeeper shivered as with an ague, his dilated eyes fixed on the
broad, corded hand that stroked the hilt of the stabbing-sword.</p>

<p>"No, no, master," he mouthed. "By Allah, I know you not&mdash;I
never saw you before&mdash;and Allah grant I never see you again,"
he added mentally.</p>

<p>"Then tell me what does this Frank here, in mail and wearing a
sword," ordered Haroun bruskly, in Turki. "The dog-Venetians are
allowed to trade in Damietta as in Alexandria, but they pay for the
privilege in humility and insult, and none dares gird on a blade
here&mdash;much less lift it against a Believer."</p>

<p>"He is no Venetian, good Haroun," answered the innkeeper.
"Yesterday he came ashore from a Venetian trading-galley, but he
consorts not with the traders or the crew of the infidels. He
strides boldly through the streets, wearing steel openly and
ruffling against all who would cross him. He says he is going to
Jerusalem and could not find a ship bound for any port in
Palestine, so came here, intending to travel the rest of the way by
land. The Believers have said he is mad, and none molests him."</p>

<p>"Truly, the mad are touched by Allah and given His protection,"
mused Haroun. "Yet this man is not altogether mad, I think. Bring
wine, dog!"</p>

<p>The innkeeper ducked in a deep salaam and hastened off to do the
Traveler's bidding. The Prophet's command against strong drink was
among other orthodox precepts disobeyed in Damietta where many
nations foregathered and Turk rubbed shoulders with Copt, Arab with
Sudani.</p>

<p>Haroun seated himself opposite the Frank and took the wine
goblet proffered by a servant.</p>

<p>"You sit in the midst of your enemies like a shah of the East,
my lord," he grinned. "By Allah, you have the bearing of a
king."</p>

<p>"I am a king, infidel," growled the other; the wine he had drunk
had touched him with a reckless and mocking madness.</p>

<p>"And where lies your kingdom, <i>malik?</i>" The question was
not asked in mockery. Haroun had seen many broken kings drifting
among the debris that floated Eastward.</p>

<p>"On the dark side of the moon," answered the Frank with a wild
and bitter laugh. "Among the ruins of all the unborn or forgotten
empires which etch the twilight of the lost ages. Cahal Ruadh
O'Donnel, king of Ireland&mdash;the name means naught to you,
Haroun of the East, and naught to the land which was my birthright.
They who were my foes sit in the high seats of power, they who were
my vassals lie cold and still, the bats haunt my shattered castles,
and already the name of Red Cahal is dim in the memories of men.
So&mdash;fill up my goblet, slave!"</p>

<p>"You have the soul of a warrior, <i>malik</i>. Was it treachery
overcame you?"</p>

<p>"Aye, treachery," swore Cahal, "and the wiles of a woman who
coiled about my soul until I was as one blind&mdash;to be cast out
at the end like a broken pawn. Aye, the Lady Elinor de Courcey,
with her black hair like midnight shadows on Lough Derg, and the
gray eyes of her, like&mdash;" he started suddenly, like a man
waking from a trance, and his wayward eyes blazed.</p>

<p>"Saints and devils!" he roared. "Who are you that I should spill
out my soul to? The wine has betrayed me and loosened my tongue,
but I&mdash;" He reached for his sword but Haroun laughed.</p>

<p>"I've done you no harm, <i>malik</i>. Turn this murderous spirit
of yours into another channel. By Erlik, I'll give you a test to
cool your blood!"</p>

<p>Rising, he caught up a javelin lying beside a drunken soldier,
and striding around the table, his eyes recklessly alight, he
extended his massive arm, gripping the shaft close to the middle,
point upward.</p>

<p>"Grip the shaft, <i>malik</i>," he laughed. "In all my days I
have met no one who was man enough to twist a stave out of my
hand."</p>

<p>Cahal rose and gripped the shaft so that his clenched fingers
almost touched those of Haroun. Then, legs braced wide, arms bent
at the elbow, each man exerted his full strength against the other.
They were well matched; Cahal was a trifle taller, Haroun thicker
of body. It was bear opposed to tiger. Like two statues they stood
straining, neither yielding an inch, the javelin almost motionless
under the equal forces. Then, with a sudden rending snap, the tough
wood gave way and each man staggered, holding half the shaft, which
had parted under the terrific strain.</p>

<p>"<i>Hai!</i>" shouted Haroun, his eyes sparkling; then they
dulled with sudden doubt.</p>

<p>"By Allah, <i>malik</i>," said he, "this is an ill thing! Of two
men, one should be master of the other, lest both come to a bad
end. Yet this signifies that neither of us will ever yield to the
other, and in the end, each will work the other ill."</p>

<p>"Sit down and drink," answered the Gael, tossing aside the
broken shaft and reaching for the wine goblet, his dreams of lost
grandeur and his anger both apparently forgotten. "I have not been
long in the East, but I knew not there were such as you among the
paynim. Surely you are not one with the Egyptians, Arabs and Turks
I have seen."</p>

<p>"I was born far to the east, among the tents of the Golden
Horde, on the steppes of High Asia," said Haroun, his mood changing
back to joviality as he flung himself down on his bench. "Ha! I was
almost a man grown before I heard of Muhammad&mdash;on whom peace!
<i>Hai, bogatyr,</i> I have been many things! Once I was a
princeling of the Tatars&mdash;son of the lord Subotai who was
right hand to Genghis Khan. Once I was a slave&mdash;when the
Turkomans drove a raid east and carried off youths and girls from
the Horde. In the slave markets of El Kahira I was sold for three
pieces of silver, by Allah, and my master gave me to the
Bahairiz&mdash;the slave-soldiers&mdash;because he feared I'd
strangle him. Ha! Now I am Haroun the Traveler, making pilgrimage
to the holy place. But once, only a few days agone, I was man to
Baibars&mdash;whom the devil fly away with!"</p>

<p>"Men say in the streets that this Baibars is the real ruler of
Cairo," said Cahal curiously; new to the East though he was, he had
heard that name oft-repeated.</p>

<p>"Men lie," responded Haroun. "The sultan rules Egypt and Shadjar
ad Darr rules the sultan. Baibars is only the general of the
Bahairiz&mdash;the great oaf!</p>

<p>"I was his man!" he shouted suddenly, with a great laugh, "to
come and go at his bidding&mdash;to put him to bed&mdash;to rise
with him&mdash;to sit down at meat with him&mdash;aye, and to put
food and drink into his fool's-mouth. But I have escaped him!
Allah, by Allah and by Allah, I have naught to do with this great
fool Baibars tonight! I am a free man and the devil may fly away
with him and with the sultan, and Shadjar ad Darr and all Saladin's
empire! But I am my own man tonight!"</p>

<p>He pulsed with an energy that would not let him be still or
silent; he seemed vibrant and joyously mad with the sheer
exuberance of life and the huge mirth of living. With gargantuan
laughter he smote the table thunderously with his open hand and
roared: "By Allah, <i>malik</i>, you shall help me celebrate my
escape from the great oaf Baibars&mdash;whom the devil fly away
with! Away with this slop, dogs! Bring kumiss! The Nazarene lord
and I intend to hold such a drinking bout as Damietta's inns have
not seen in a hundred years!"</p>

<p>"But my master has already emptied a full wine pitcher and is
more than half drunk!" clamored the nondescript servant Cahal had
picked up on the wharves&mdash;not that he cared, but whomever he
served, he wished to have the best of any contest, and besides it
was his Oriental instinct to intrude his say.</p>

<p>"So!" roared Haroun, catching up a full wine pitcher. "I will
not take advantage of any man! See&mdash;I quaff this thimbleful
that we may start on even terms!" And drinking deeply, he flung
down the pitcher empty.</p>

<p>The servants of the inn brought kumiss&mdash;fermented mare's
milk, in leathern skins, bound and sealed&mdash;illegal drink,
brought down by the caravans from the lands of the Turkomans, to
tempt the sated palates of nobles, and to satisfy the craving of
the steppesmen among the mercenaries and the Bahairiz.</p>

<p>Then, goblet for goblet with Haroun, Cahal quaffed the
unfamiliar, whitish, acid stuff, and never had the exiled Irish
prince seen such a cup- companion as this wanderer. For between
enormous drafts, Haroun shook the smoke-stained rafters with giant
laughter, and shouted over spicy tales that breathed the very
scents of Cairo's merry obscenity and high comedy. He sang Arab
love songs that sighed with the whisper of palm leaves and the
swish of silken veils, and he roared riding songs in a tongue none
in the tavern understood, but which vibrated with the drum of
Mongol hoofs and the clashing of swords.</p>

<p>The moon had set and even the clamor of Damietta had ebbed in
the darkness before dawn, when Haroun staggered up and clutched
reeling at the table for support. A single weary slave stood by, to
pour wine. Keeper, servants and guests snored on the floor or had
slipped away long before. Haroun shouted a thick-tongued war cry
and yelled aloud with the sheer riotousness of his mirth. Sweat
stood in beads on his face and the veins of his temples swelled and
throbbed from his excesses. His wild wayward eyes danced with
joyous deviltry.</p>

<p>"Would you were not a king, <i>malik!</i>" he roared, catching
up a stout bludgeon. "I would show you cudgel-play! Aye, my blood
is racing like a Turkoman stallion and in good sport I would fain
deal strong blows on somebody's pate, by Allah!"</p>

<p>"Then grip your stick, man," answered Cahal reeling up. "Men
call me fool, but no man has ever said I was backward where blows
were going, be they of steel or wood!"</p>

<p>Upsetting the table, he gripped a leg and wrenched powerfully.
There was a splintering of wood, and the rough leg came away in his
iron hand.</p>

<p>"Here is my cudgel, wanderer!" roared the Gael. "Let the
breaking of heads begin and if the Prophet loves you, he'd best
fling his mantle over your skull!"</p>

<p>"Salaam to you, <i>malik!</i>" yelled Haroun. "No other king
since Malik Ric would take up cudgels with a masterless wanderer!"
And with giant laughter, he lunged.</p>

<p>The fight was necessarily short and fierce. The wine they had
drunk had made eye and hand uncertain, and their feet unsteady, but
it had not robbed them of their tigerish strength. Haroun struck
first, as a bear strikes, and it was by luck rather than skill that
Cahal partly parried the whistling blow. Even so it fell glancingly
above his ear, filling his vision with a myriad sparks of light,
and knocking him back against the upset table. Cahal gripped the
table edge with his left hand for support and struck back so
savagely and swiftly that Haroun could neither duck nor parry.
Blood spattered, the cudgel splintered in Cahal's hand and the
Traveler dropped like a log, to lie motionless.</p>

<p>Cahal flung aside his cudgel with a motion of disgust and shook
his head violently to clear it.</p>

<p>"Neither of us would yield to the other&mdash;well, in this I
have prevailed&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped. Haroun lay sprawled serenely and a sound of placid
snoring rose on the air. Cahal's blow had laid open his scalp and
felled him, but it was the incredible amount of liquor the Tatar
had drunk that had caused him to lie where he had fallen. And now
Cahal knew that if he did not get out into the cool night air at
once, he too would fall senseless beside Haroun.</p>

<p>Cursing himself disgustedly, he kicked his servant awake and
gathering up shield, helmet and cloak, staggered out of the inn.
Great white clusters of stars hung over the flat roofs of Damietta,
reflected in the black lapping waves of the river. Dogs and beggars
slept in the dust of the street, and in the black shadows of the
crooked alleys not even a thief stole. Cahal swung into the saddle
of the horse the sleepy servant brought, and reined his way through
the winding silent streets. A cold wind, forerunner of dawn,
cleared away the fumes of the wine as he rode out of the tangle of
alleys and bazaars. Dawn was not yet whitening the east, but the
tang of dawn was in the air.</p>

<p>Past the flat-topped mud huts along the irrigation ditches he
rode, past the wells with their long wooden sweeps and deep clumps
of palms. Behind him the ancient city slumbered, shadowy,
mysterious, alluring. Before him stretched the sands of the
Jifar.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="sowers2" name="sowers2">CHAPTER 2</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE BEDOUINS did not cut Red Cahal's throat on the
road from Damietta to Ascalon. He was preserved for a different
destiny and so he rode, careless, and alone except for his
ragamuffin servant, across the wastelands, and no barbed arrow or
curved blade touched him, though a band of hawk-like riders in
floating white khalats harried him the last part of the way and
followed him like a wolf pack to the very gates of the Christian
outposts.</p>

<p>It was a restless and unquiet land through which Red Cahal rode
on his pilgrimage to Jerusalem in the warm spring days of that year
1243. The red- haired prince learned much that was new to him, of
the land which had been but a vague haze of disconnected names and
events in his mind when he started on his exiled pilgrimage. He had
known that the Emperor Frederick II had regained Jerusalem from the
infidels without fighting a battle. Now he learned that the Holy
City was shared with the Moslems&mdash;to whom it likewise was
holy; Al Kuds, the Holy, they called it, for from thence, they
said, Muhammad ascended to paradise, and there on the last day
would he sit in judgment on the souls of men.</p>

<p>And Cahal learned that the kingdom of Outremer was but a shadow
of an heroic past. In the north Bohemund VI held Antioch and
Tripoli. In the south Christendom held the coast as far as Ascalon,
with some inland towns such as Hebron, Bethlehem, and Ramlah. The
grim castles of the Templars and of the Knights of St. John loomed
like watchdogs above the land and the fierce soldier-monks wore
arms day and night, ready to ride to any part of the kingdom
threatened by pagan invasion. But how long could that thin line of
ramparts and men along the coast stand against the growing pressure
of the heathen hinterlands?</p>

<p>In the talk of castle and tavern, as he rode toward Jerusalem,
Cahal heard again the name of Baibars. Men said the sultan of
Egypt, kin of the great Saladin, was in his dotage, ruled by the
girl-slave, Shadjar ad Darr, and that sharing her rule were the
war-chiefs, Ae Beg the Kurd, and Baibars the Panther. This Baibars
was a devil in human form, men said&mdash;a guzzler of wine and a
lover of women; yet his wits were as keen as a monk's and his
prowess in battle was the subject of many songs among the Arab
minstrels. A strong man, and ambitious.</p>

<p>He was generalissimo of the mercenaries, men said, who were the
real strength of the Egyptian army&mdash;Bahairiz, some called
them, others the White Slaves of the River, the memluks. This host
was, in the main, composed of Turkish slaves, raised up in its
ranks and trained only in the arts of war. Baibars himself had
served as a common soldier in the ranks, rising to power by the
sheer might of his arm. He could eat a roasted sheep at one meal,
the Arab wanderers said, and though wine was forbidden the
Faithful, it was well known that he had drunk all his officers
under the table. He had been known to break a man's spine in his
bare hands in a moment of rage, and when he rode into battle
swinging his heavy scimitar, none could stand before him.</p>

<p>And if this incarnate devil came up out of the South with his
cutthroats, how could the lords of Outremer stand against him,
without the aid that war- torn and intrigue-racked Europe had
ceased to send? Spies slipped among the Franks, learning their
weaknesses, and it was said that Baibars himself had gained
entrance into Bohemund's palace in the guise of a wandering
teller-of- tales. He must be in league with the Evil One himself,
this Egyptian chief. He loved to go among his people in disguise,
it was said, and he ruthlessly slew any man who recognized him. A
strange soul, full of wayward whims, yet ferocious as a tiger.</p>

<p>Yet it was not so much Baibars of whom the people talked, nor
yet of Sultan Ismail, the Moslem lord of Damascus. There was a
threat in the blue mysterious East which overshadowed both these
nearer foes.</p>

<p>Cahal heard of a strange new terrible people, like a scourge out
of the East&mdash;Mongols, or Tartars as the priests called them,
swearing they were the veritable demons of Tatary, spoken of by the
prophets of old. More than a score of years before they had burst
like a sandstorm out of the East, trampling all in their path;
Islam had crumpled before them and kings had been dashed into the
dust. And as their chief, men named one Subotai, whom Haroun the
traveler, Cahal remembered, had claimed as sire.</p>

<p>Then the horde had turned its course and the Holy Land had been
spared. The Mongols had drifted back into the limbo of the unknown
East with their oxtail standards, their lacquered armor, their
kettledrums and terrible bows, and men had almost forgotten them.
But now of late years the vultures had circled again in the East,
and from time to time news had trickled down through the hills of
the Kurds, of the Turkoman clans flying in shattered rout before
the yak-tail banners. Suppose the unconquerable Horde should turn
southward? Subotai had spared Palestine&mdash;but who knew the mind
of Mangu Khan, whom the Arab wanderers named the present lord of
the nomads?</p>

<p>So the people talked in the dreamy spring weather as Cahal rode
to Jerusalem, seeking to forget the past, losing himself in the
present; absorbing the spirit and traditions of the country and the
people, picking up new languages with the characteristic facility
of the Gael.</p>

<p>He journeyed to Hebron, and in the great cathedral of the Virgin
at Bethlehem, knelt beside the crypt where candles burned to mark
the birthplace of our fair Seigneur Christ. And he rode up to
Jerusalem, with its ruined walls and its mullahs calling the
muezzin within earshot of the priests chanting beside the
Sepulcher. Those walls had been destroyed by the Sultan of
Damascus, years before.</p>

<p>Beyond the Via Dolorosa he saw the slender columns of the Al
Aksa portals and was told Christian hands first shaped them. He was
shown mosques that had once been Christian chapels, and was told
that the gilded dome above the mosque of Omar covered a gray rock
which was the Muhammadan holy of holies&mdash;the rock whence the
Prophet ascended to paradise. Aye, and thereon, in the days of
Israel, had Abraham stood, and the Ark of the Covenant had rested,
and the Temple whence Christ drove the merchants; for the Rock was
the pinnacle of Mount Moriah, one of the two mountains on which
Jerusalem was built.</p>

<p>But now the Moslem Dome of the Rock hid it from Christian view,
and dervishes with naked swords stood night and day to bar the way
of Unbelievers; though nominally the city was in Christian hands.
And Cahal realized how weak the Franks of Outremer had grown.</p>

<p>He rode in the hills about the Holy City and stood on the Mount
of Olives where Tancred had stood, nearly a hundred and fifty years
before, for his first sight of Jerusalem. And he dreamed deep dim
dreams of those old days when men first rode from the West strong
with faith and eager with zeal, to found a kingdom of God.</p>

<p>Now men cut their neighbors' throats in the West and cried out
beneath the heels of ambitious kings and greedy popes, and in their
wars and crying out, forgot that thin frontier where the remnants
of a fading glory clung to their slender boundaries.</p>

<p>Through budding spring, hot summer and dreamy autumn, Red Cahal
rode&mdash;following a blind pilgrimage that led even beyond
Jerusalem and whose goal he could not see or guess. Ascalon he
tarried in, Tyre, Jaffa and Acre. He was visitor at the castles of
the Military Orders. Walter de Brienne offered him a part in the
rule of the fading kingdom, but Cahal shook his head and rode on.
The throne he had never pressed had been snatched beyond his reach
and no other earthly glory would suffice.</p>

<p>And so in the budding dream of a new spring he came to the
castle of Renault d'Ibelin beyond the frontier.</p>

<h2><a id="sowers3" name="sowers3">CHAPTER 3</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE SIEUR RENAULT was a cousin of the powerful
crusading family of d'Ibelin which held its grim gray castles on
the coast, but little of the fruits of conquest had fallen to him.
A wanderer and adventurer, living by his wits and the edge of his
sword, he had gotten more hard blows than gold. He was a tall lean
man with hawk-eyes and a predatory nose. His mail was worn, his
velvet cloak shabby and torn, the gems long gone from hilt of sword
and dagger.</p>

<p>And the knight's hold was a haunt of poverty. The dry moat which
encircled the castle was filled up in many places; the outer walls
were mere heaps of crumbled stone. Weeds grew rank in the courtyard
and over the filled-up well.</p>

<p>The chambers of the castle were dusty and bare, and the great
desert spiders spun their webs on the cold stones. Lizards
scampered across the broken flags and the tramp of mailed feet
resounded eerily in the echoing emptiness. No merry villagers
bearing grain and wine thronged the barren courts, and no gayly
clad pages sang among the dusty corridors. For over half a century
the keep had stood deserted, until d'lbelin had ridden across the
Jordan to make it a reaver's hold. For the Sieur Renault, in the
stress of poverty, had become no more than a bandit chief, raiding
the caravans of the Moslems.</p>

<p>And now in the dim dusty tower of the crumbling hold, the knight
in his shabby finery sat at wine with his guest.</p>

<p>"The tale of your betrayal is not entirely unknown to me, good
sir," said Renault&mdash;unbidden, for since that night of
drunkenness in Damietta, Cahal had not spoken of his past. "Some
word of affairs in Ireland has drifted into this isolated land. As
one ruined adventurer to another, I bid you welcome. But I would
like to hear the tale from your own lips."</p>

<p>Cahal laughed mirthlessly and drank deeply.</p>

<p>"A tale soon told and best forgotten. I was a wanderer, living
by my sword, robbed of my heritage before my birth. The English
lords pretended to sympathize with my claim to the Irish throne. If
I would aid them against the O'Neills, they would throw off their
allegiance to Henry of England&mdash;would serve me as my barons.
So swore William Fitzgerald and his peers. I am not an utter fool.
They had not persuaded me so easily but for the Lady Elinor de
Courcey, with her black hair and proud Norman eyes&mdash;who
feigned love for me. Hell!</p>

<p>"Why draw out the tale? I fought for them&mdash;won wars for
them. They tricked me and cast me aside. I went into battle for the
throne with less than a thousand men. Their bones rot in the hills
of Donegal and better had I died there&mdash;but my kerns bore me
senseless from the field. And then my own clan cast me forth.</p>

<p>"I took the cross&mdash;after I cut the throat of William
Fitzgerald among his own henchmen. Speak of it no more; my kingdom
was clouds and moonmist. I seek forgetfulness&mdash;of lost
ambition and the ghost of a dead love."</p>

<p>"Stay here and raid the caravans with me," suggested
Renault.</p>

<p>Cahal shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It would not last, I fear. With but forty-five men-at-arms, you
can not hold this pile of ruins long. I have seen that the old well
is long choked and broken in, and the reservoirs shattered. In case
of a siege you would have only the tanks you have built, filled
with water you carry from the muddy spring outside the walls. They
would last only a few days at most."</p>

<p>"Poverty drives men to desperate deeds," frankly admitted
Renault. "Godfrey, first lord of Jerusalem, built this castle for
an outpost in the days when his rule extended beyond Jordan.
Saladin stormed and partly dismantled it, and since then it has
housed only the bat and the jackal. I made it my lair, from whence
I raid the caravans which go down to Mecca, but the plunder has
been scanty enough.</p>

<p>"My neighbor the Shaykh Suleyman ibn Omad will inevitably wipe
me out if I bide here long, though I have skirmished successfully
with his riders and beat off a flying raid. He has sworn to hang my
head on his tower, driven to madness by my raids on the Mecca
pilgrims whom it is his obligation to protect.</p>

<p>"Well, I have another thing in mind. Look, I scratch a map on
the table with my dagger-point. Here is this castle; here to the
north is El Omad, the stronghold of the Shaykh Suleyman. Now
look&mdash;far to the east I trace a wandering line&mdash;so. That
is the great river Euphrates, which begins in the hills of Asia
Minor and traverses the whole plain, joining at last with the
Tigris and flowing into Bahr el Fars&mdash;the Persian
Gulf&mdash;below Bassorah. Thus&mdash;I trace the Tigris.</p>

<p>"Now where I make this mark beside the river Tigris stands Mosul
of the Persians. Beyond Mosul lies an unknown land of deserts and
mountains, but among those mountains there is a city called
Shahazar, the treasure-trove of the sultans. There the lords of the
East send their gold and jewels for safekeeping, and the city is
ruled by a cult of warriors sworn to safeguard the treasures. The
gates are kept bolted night and day, and no caravans pass out of
the city. It is a secret place of wealth and pleasure and the
Moslems seek to keep word of it from Christian ears. Now it is my
mind to desert this ruin and ride east in quest of that city!"</p>

<p>Cahal smiled in admiration of the splendid madness, but shook
his head.</p>

<p>"If it is as well guarded as you say, how could a handful of men
hope to take it, even if they win through the hostile country which
lies between?"</p>

<p>"Because a handful of Franks <i>has</i> taken it," retorted
d'Ibelin. "Nearly half a century ago the adventurer Cormac
FitzGeoffrey raided Shahazar among the mountains and bore away
untold plunder. What he did, another can do. Of course, it is
madness; the chances are all that the Kurds will cut our throats
before we ever see the banks of the Euphrates. But we will ride
swiftly &mdash;and then, the Moslems may be so engaged with the
Mongols, a small, hard-riding band might slip through. We will ride
ahead of the news of our coming, and smite Shahazar as a whirlwind
smites. Lord Cahal, shall we sit supine until Baibars comes up out
of Egypt and cuts all our throats, or shall we cast the dice of
chance to loot the eagle's eyrie under the nose of Moslem and
Mongol alike?"</p>

<p>Cahal's cold eyes gleamed and he laughed aloud as the lurking
madness in his soul responded to the madness of the proposal. His
hard hand smote against the brown palm of Renault d'Ibelin.</p>

<p>"Doom hovers over all Outremer, and Death is no grimmer met on a
mad quest than in the locked spears of battle! East we ride to the
Devil knows what doom!"</p>

<p>The sun had scarce set when Cahal's ragged servant, who had
followed him faithfully through all his previous wanderings, stole
away from the ruined walls and rode toward Jordan, flogging his
shaggy pony hard. The madness of his master was no affair of his
and life was sweet, even to a Cairo gutter-waif.</p>

<p>The first stars were blinking when Renault d'Ibelin and Red
Cahal rode down the slope at the head of the men-at-arms. A
hard-bitten lot these were, lean taciturn fighters, born in
Outremer for the most part&mdash;a few veterans of Normandy and the
Rhineland who had followed wandering lords into the Holy Land and
had remained. They were well armed&mdash;clad in chain-mail shirts
and steel caps, bearing kite-shaped shields. They rode fleet Arab
horses and tall Turkoman steeds, and led horses followed. It was
the capture of a number of fine steeds which had crystallized the
idea of the raid in Renault's mind.</p>

<p>D'Ibelin had long learned the lesson of the East&mdash;swift
marches that went ahead of the news of the raid, and depended on
the quality of the mounts. Yet he knew the whole plan was madness.
Cahal and Renault rode into the unknown land and far in the east
the vultures circled endlessly.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="sowers4" name="sowers4">CHAPTER 4</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE BEARDED WATCHER on the tower above the gates
of El Omad shaded his hawk-eyes. In the east a dust cloud grew and
out of the cloud a black dot came flying. And the lean Arab knew it
was a lone horseman, riding hard. He shouted a warning, and in an
instant other lean, hawk-eyed figures were at his side, brown
fingers toying with bowstring and cane-shafted spear. They watched
the approaching figure with the intentness of men born to feud and
raid.</p>

<p>"A Frank," grunted one, "and on a dying horse."</p>

<p>They watched tensely as the lone rider dipped out of sight in a
dry wadi, came into view again on the near side, clattered
reelingly across the dusty level and drew rein beneath the gate. A
lean hand drew shaft to ear, but a word from the first watcher
halted the archer. The Frank below had half-climbed, half-fallen
from his reeling horse, and now he staggered to the gate and smote
against it resoundingly with his mailed fist.</p>

<p>"By Allah and by Allah!" swore the bearded watcher in wonder.
"The Nazarene is mad!" He leaned over the battlement and shouted:
"Oh, dead man, what wouldst thou at the gate of El Omad?"</p>

<p>The Frank looked up with eyes glazed from thirst and the burning
winds of the desert. His mail was white with the drifting dust,
with which likewise his lips were parched and caked. He spoke with
difficulty.</p>

<p>"Open the gates, dog, lest ill befall you!"</p>

<p>"It is Kizil Malik&mdash;the Red King&mdash;whom men call The
Mad," whispered an archer. "He rode with the lord Renault, the
shepherds say. Hold him in play while I fetch the Shaykh."</p>

<p>"Art thou weary of life, Nazarene," called the first speaker,
"that thou comest to the gate of thine enemy?"</p>

<p>"Fetch the lord of the castle, dog," roared the Gael. "I parley
not with menials&mdash;and my horse is dying."</p>

<p>The tall lean form of Shaykh Suleyman ibn Omad loomed among the
guardsmen and the old chief swore in his beard.</p>

<p>"By Allah, this is a trap of some sort. Nazarene, what do ye
here?"</p>

<p>Cahal licked his blackened lips with a dry tongue.</p>

<p>"When the wild dogs run, panther and buffalo flee together," he
said. "Doom rushes from the east on Moslem and Christian alike. I
bring you warning&mdash;call in your vassals and make fast your
gates, lest another rising sun find you sleeping among the charred
embers of your hold. I claim the courtesy due a perishing
traveler&mdash;and my horse is dying."</p>

<p>"It is no trap," growled the Shaykh in his beard. "The Frank has
a tale&mdash;there has been a harrying in the east and perchance
the Mongols are upon us&mdash;open the gates, dogs, and let him
in."</p>

<p>Through the opened gates Cahal unsteadily led his drooping
steed, and his first words gained him esteem among the Arabs.</p>

<p>"See to my horse," he mumbled, and willing hands complied.</p>

<p>Cahal stumbled to a horse block and sank down, his head in his
hands. A slave gave him a flagon of water and he drank avidly. As
he set down the flagon he was aware that the Shaykh had come from
the tower and stood before him. Suleyman's keen eyes ran over the
Gael from head to foot, noting the lines of weariness on his face,
the dust that caked his mail, the fresh dints on helmet and
shield&mdash;black dried blood was caked thick about the mouth of
his scabbard, showing he had sheathed his sword without pausing to
cleanse it.</p>

<p>"You have fought hard and fled swiftly," concluded Suleyman
aloud.</p>

<p>"Aye, by the Saints!" laughed the prince. "I have fled for a
night and a day and a night without rest. This horse is the third
which has fallen under me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whom do you flee?"</p>

<p>"A horde that must have ridden up from the dim limbo of Hell!
Wild riders with tall fur caps and the heads of wolves on their
standards."</p>

<p><i>"Allah il Allah!"</i> swore Suleyman.
"Kharesmians!&mdash;flying before the Mongols!"</p>

<p>"They were apparently fleeing some greater horde," answered
Cahal. "Let me tell the tale swiftly&mdash;the Sieur Renault and I
rode east with all his men, seeking the fabled city of
Shahazar&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So that was the quest!" interrupted Suleyman. "Well, I was
preparing to sweep down and stamp out that robbers' nest when
divers herdsmen brought me word that the bandits had ridden away
swiftly in the night like the thieves they were. I could have
ridden after, but knew that Christians riding eastward but rode to
their doom&mdash;and none can alter the will of Allah."</p>

<p>"Aye," grinned Cahal wolfishly, "east to our doom we rode, like
men riding blind into the teeth of a storm. We slashed our way
through the lands of the Kurds and crossed the Euphrates. Beyond,
far to the east, we saw smoke and flame and the wheeling of many
vultures, and Renault said the Turkomans fought the Horde. But we
met no fugitives and I wondered then&mdash;I wonder not now. The
slayers rode over them like a wave out of the night and none was
left to flee.</p>

<p>"Like men riding to death in a dream, we rode into the onrushing
storm and the suddenness of its coming was like a thunderbolt. A
sudden drum of hoofs over a ridge and they were upon
us&mdash;hundreds of them, a swarm of outriders scouting ahead of
the horde. There was no chance to flee&mdash;our men died where
they stood."</p>

<p>"And the Sieur Renault?" asked the Shaykh.</p>

<p>"Dead!" said Cahal. "I saw a curved blade cleave his helmet and
his skull."</p>

<p>"Allah be merciful and save his soul from the hellfire of
unbelievers!" piously exclaimed Suleyman, who had sworn to kill the
luckless adventurer on sight.</p>

<p>"He took toll before he fell," grimly answered the Gael. "By
God, the heathen lay like ripe grain beneath our horses' hoofs
before the last man fell. I alone hacked my way through."</p>

<p>The Shaykh, grown old in warfare, visualized the scene that lay
behind that simple sentence&mdash;the swarming, howling, fur-clad
horsemen with their barbaric war cries, and Red Cahal riding like a
wind of Death through that maelstrom of flashing blades, his sword
singing in his hand as horse and rider went down before him.</p>

<p>"I outstripped the pursuers," said Cahal, "and as I rode over a
hill I looked back and saw the great black mass of the horde
swarming like locusts over the land, filling the sky with the
clamor of their kettledrums. The Turkomans had risen behind us as
we had raced through their lands, and now the desert was alive with
horsemen&mdash;but the whole east was aflame and the tribesmen had
no time to hunt down a single rider. They were faced with a
stronger foe. So I won through.</p>

<p>"My horse fell under me, but I stole a steed from a herd watched
by a Turkoman boy. When it could do no more, I took a mount from a
wandering Kurd who rode up, thinking to loot a dying traveler. And
now I say to you, whom men dub the Watcher of the
Trail&mdash;beware, lest these demons from the east ride over your
ruins as they have ridden over the corpses of the Turkomans. I do
not think they'll lay siege&mdash;they are like wolves ranging the
steppes; they strike and pass on. But they ride like the wind. They
have crossed the Euphrates. Behind me last night the sky was red as
blood. Hard as I have ridden, they must be close on my heels."</p>

<p>"Let them come," grimly answered the Arab. "El Omad has held out
against Nazarene, Kurd and Turk&mdash;for a hundred years no foe
has set foot within these walls. <i>Malik</i>, this is a time when
Christian and Moslem should join hands. I thank you for your
warning, and beg you to aid me in holding the walls."</p>

<p>But Cahal shook his head.</p>

<p>"You will not need my help, and I have other work to do. It was
not to save my worthless life that I have ridden three noble steeds
to death&mdash;otherwise I had left my body beside Renault
d'Ibelin. I must ride on; Jerusalem is in the path of these devils,
with its ruined walls and scanty guard."</p>

<p>Suleyman paled and plucked his beard.</p>

<p>"Al Kuds! These pagan dogs will slay Christian and Muhammadan
alike, and desecrate the holy places!"</p>

<p>"And so," Cahal rose stiffly, "I must on to warn them. So
swiftly have these Kharesmians come that no word of their coming
can have gone into Palestine. On me alone the burden of warning
lies. Give me a fleet horse and let me go."</p>

<p>"You can do no more," objected Suleyman. "You are
foredone&mdash;an hour more and you would drop senseless from the
saddle. I will send one of my men instead&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cahal shook his head. "The duty is mine. Yet I will sleep an
hour&mdash;one small hour can make no great difference. Then I will
fare on."</p>

<p>"Come to my couch," urged Suleyman, but the hardy Gael shook his
head.</p>

<p>"This has been my couch before," said he, and flinging himself
down on the scanty grass of the courtyard, he drew his cloak about
him and fell into the deep sleep of utter exhaustion. Yet he slept
but an hour when he awoke of his own accord. Food and wine were
placed before him and he drank and ate ravenously. His features
were still drawn and haggard, but in his short rest he had drawn
upon hidden springs of endurance. An iron man in an age of iron, he
added to his physical ruggedness a dynamic nerve-energy that
carried him beyond himself and upheld him after more stolid men had
dropped by the wayside.</p>

<p>As he reined out of the gates on a swift Arab steed, the
watchmen shouted and pointed to the east where a pillar of smoke
billowed up against the hot blue sky. The Shaykh flung up his arm
in salute as Cahal rode toward Jerusalem at a swinging gallop that
ate up the miles.</p>

<p>Bedouins in their black felt tents gaped at him; herdsmen
leaning on their staves stiffened at his shout. A rising drum of
hoofs, the wave of a mailed arm, a shouted warning, then the
dwindling hoofbeats&mdash;behind him the frenzied people snatched
up their belongings and fled shrieking to places of shelter or
hiding.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="sowers5" name="sowers5">CHAPTER 5</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE MOON was setting as Cahal splashed through the
calm waters of the Jordan, flecked with the mirrored stars. The sun
was rising when his horse fell at the gate of Jerusalem that opens
on the Damascus road. Cahal staggered up, half-dead himself, and
gazing at the crumbling ruins of the shattered walls, he groaned
aloud. On foot he hurried forward and a group of placid Syrians
watched him curiously. A bearded Flemish man-at-arms came forward,
trailing his pike. Cahal snatched a wine-flask that hung at the
soldier's girdle and emptied it at one draft.</p>

<p>"Lead me to the patriarch," he gasped throatily. "Doom rides on
swift hoofs to Jerusalem&mdash;ha!"</p>

<p>From the people a thin cry of wonder and fear had gone
up&mdash;Cahal wheeled and felt fear constrict his throat. Again in
the east he saw flying flame and drifting smoke&mdash;the gigantic
tracks of the destroying horde.</p>

<p>"They have crossed the Jordan!" he cried. "Saints of God, when
did men born of women ride so madly? They spurn the very
wind&mdash;curst be the weakness that made me waste a single
hour&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words died in his throat as he looked at the ruined walls.
Truly, an hour more or less could have no significance in that
doomed city.</p>

<p>Cahal hurried through the streets with the soldier, and he saw
that already the word had spread like wildfire. Jews in their blue
shubas ran about howling; in the streets and on the housetops women
wrung their white hands and wailed. Tall Syrians bound their
belongings on donkeys and formed the nucleus of a disorderly horde
that streamed out of the western gates staggering under bundles of
household goods. The city crouched trembling and dazed with terror
under the threat rising in the east. What horde was sweeping upon
them they did not know, nor care; death is death, whoever the
dealer.</p>

<p>Some cried out that the Tartars were upon them and both Moslem
and Nazarene shook. Cahal found the patriarch bewildered and
helpless. With a handful of soldiers, how could he defend the
wallless city? He was ready to give up his life in the vain
attempt; he could do no more. The mullahs rallied their people, and
for the first time in all history Moslem and Christian joined
forces to defend the city that was holy to both. The great mass of
the people fled into the mosques or the cathedrals, or crouched
resignedly in the streets, dumbly awaiting the stroke. Men cried on
Jehovah and on Allah, and some prophesied a miracle that should
deliver the Holy City. But in the merciless blue sky no flaming
sword appeared, only the smoke of the pillaging, the flame of the
slaughter, and at last the dust clouds of the riders.</p>

<p>The patriarch had bunched his pitiful force of men-at-arms,
knights, armed pilgrims and Moslems, at the Damascus Gate. Useless
to man the ruined walls. There they would face the horde and give
up their lives, without hope and without fear.</p>

<p>Cahal, his weariness half-forgotten in the drunkenness of
anticipated battle, reined beside the patriarch on the great red
stallion that had been given him, and cried out suddenly at the
sight of a tall, broad man on a rangy Turkish bay.</p>

<p>"Haroun, by all the Saints!"</p>

<p>The other turned toward him and Cahal wavered. Was this Haroun?
The fellow was clad in the mail shirt and peaked helmet of a
Turkish soldier. On his brawny right arm he bore a round spiked
buckler and at his belt hung a long broad scimitar, heavier by
pounds than the average Moslem blade. Moreover, Haroun had been
clean-shaven and this man wore the fierce curving mustachios of the
Turk. Yet the build of him&mdash;that square dark face&mdash;those
blazing blue eyes&mdash;</p>

<p>"By the Saints, Haroun," said Cahal heartily, "what do you
here?"</p>

<p>"Allah blast me if I be any Haroun," answered the soldier in a
deep growling voice. "I am Akbar the Soldier, come to Al Kuds on
pilgrimage. You have mistaken me for another."</p>

<p>Cahal frowned. The voice was not even that of Haroun, yet surely
in all the world there was not such another pair of eyes. He
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well, it is of no moment&mdash;where are you going?"</p>

<p>For the man had reined about.</p>

<p>"To the hills!" answered the soldier. "We can do no good by
dying here&mdash;best come with me. From the dust, it is a whole
horde that is riding upon us."</p>

<p>"Flee without striking a blow? Not I!" snapped Cahal. "Go, if
you fear."</p>

<p>Akbar swore loudly. "By Allah and by Allah! A man had better
place his head beneath an elephant's tread than call me coward!
I'll stand my ground as long as any Nazarene!"</p>

<p>Cahal turned away shortly, irritated by the fellow's manner and
by his boasting. Yet for all the soldier's wrath, it seemed to the
Gael that a vagrant twinkle lighted his fierce eyes as though he
shook with inward mirth. Then Cahal forgot him. A wail went up from
the housetops where the helpless people watched their oncoming
doom. The horde had swept into sight, up from the hazes of the
Jordan's gorge.</p>

<p>The skies shook with the clamor of the kettledrums; the earth
trembled with the thunder of the hoofs. The headlong speed of the
yelling fiends numbed the minds of their victims. From the steppes
of high Asia these barbarians had fled before the Mongols like
thistledown flying before the wind. Drunken with the blood of
slaughtered tribes, ten thousand strong they surged on Jerusalem,
where thousands of helpless folk knelt shuddering.</p>

<p>Cahal saw anew the hideous figures which had haunted his
half-delirious dreams as he swayed in the saddle on that long
flight: tall rangy steeds on which crouched the broad forms of the
riders in wolfskins and mail&mdash;square dark faces, eyes glaring
like mad dogs' from beneath high fur caps or peaked helmets;
standards with the heads of wolves, panthers and bears.</p>

<p>Headlong they swept down the Damascus road&mdash;leaping their
horses over the broken walls, crowding through the ruined gates at
breakneck speed&mdash;and headlong they smote the clump of
defenders which spurred to meet them&mdash;smote them, broke them,
shattered them, trampled them down and under, and over their
mangled bodies, struck the heart of the doomed city.</p>

<p>Red hell reigned rampant in the streets of Jerusalem, where
helpless men, women and children ran screaming before the slayers
who rode them down, howling like wolves, spitting babes on their
lances and holding them on high like gory standards. Under the
frenzied hoofs pitiful forms fell writhing and blood flooded the
gutters. Dark blood-stained hands tore the garments from shrieking
girls and lance-butts shattered doors and windows behind which
cowered terrified prey. All objects of worth were ripped from their
places and screams of agony rose to the smoke-fouled heavens as the
victims were tortured with steel and fire to make them give up
their pitiful treasures. Death stalked howling through the streets
of Jerusalem and men blasphemed their gods as they died.</p>

<p>In the first irresistible flood of that charge, such defenders
as were not instantly ridden down had been torn apart and swept
back in utter confusion. The weight of the impact had swept Red
Cahal's steed away as on the crest of a flood, and he found himself
reining about in a narrow alley, where he had been tossed as a bit
of driftwood is flung into a back-eddy by a rushing tide. He had
lost sight of the patriarch and had no doubt that he lay among the
trampled dead before the Damascus Gate.</p>

<p>His sword was red to the hilt, his soul ablaze with the
battle-lust, his brain sick with fury and horror as the cries of
the butchered city smote on his ears.</p>

<p>"I'll leave my corpse before the Sepulcher," he growled, and
wheeling, spurred up the alley. He raced down a narrow winding
street and emerged upon the Via Dolorosa just as the first
Kharesmian came flying along it, scimitar dripping crimson. The red
stallion's shoulder brushed the barbarian's stirrup and Cahal's
sword flashed like a sunburst. The Kharesmian's head leaped from
his shoulders on an arch of crimson and the Gael yelped with
murderous exultation.</p>

<p>And now came another riding like the wind, and Cahal saw it was
Akbar. The soldier reined in and shouted, "Well, good sir, are you
still determined to sacrifice both our lives?"</p>

<p>"Your life is your own&mdash;my life is mine!" roared Cahal,
eyes blazing.</p>

<p>He saw that a group of horsemen had ridden up to the Sepulcher
from another street and were dismounting, shouting in their
barbaric tongue, spattering the holy stones with blood-drops from
their blades. In a red mist of fury Cahal smote them as an
avalanche smites the pines. His whistling sword cleft buckler and
helmet, severing necks and splitting skulls; under the hammering
hoofs of his screaming charger, men rolled with smashed heads. And
even in his madness Cahal was aware that he was not alone. Akbar
had charged after him; his great voice roared above the clamor and
the heavy scimitar in his left hand crashed through mail and flesh
and bone.</p>

<p>The men before the Sepulcher lay in a silent gory heap when
Cahal reined back and shook the bloody mist from his eyes. Akbar
roared in a strange tongue and smote him thunderously on the
shoulders.</p>

<p><i>"Bodga, bogatyr!"</i> he roared, his eyes dancing, and no
longer Cahal doubted that he was Haroun. "You fight like a hero, by
Erlik! But come, <i>malik</i>&mdash;you have offered a noble
sacrifice to your God and He'll hardly blame you for saving
yourself now. Thunder of Allah, man, we can not fight ten
thousand!"</p>

<p>"Ride on," answered Cahal, shaking the red drops from his blade.
"Here I die."</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Akbar, "if you wish to throw away your life here
where it will do no good&mdash;that's your affair! The heathen may
thank you, but your brothers scarcely will, when the raiders smite
them suddenly! The horsemen are all dead or hemmed in the alleys.
Only you and I escaped that charge. Who will carry the news of the
raid to the Frankish barons?"</p>

<p>"You speak truth," said Cahal shortly. "Let us go."</p>

<p>The pair wheeled away and galloped down the street just as a
howling horde came flying up the other end. Beyond the shattered
walls Cahal looked back to see a mounting flame. He hid his face in
his hands.</p>

<p>"Wounds of God!" he groaned. "They are burning the
Sepulcher!"</p>

<p>"And defiling the Al Aksa mosque too, I doubt not," said Akbar
tranquilly. "Well, that which is written will come to pass, and no
man may escape his fate. All things pass away, yes, even the Holy
of Holies."</p>

<p>Cahal shook his head, soul-sick. They rode through toiling bands
of fugitives who screamed and caught at their stirrups, but Cahal
steeled his heart. If he was to bear warning to the barons, he
could not be burdened by helpless ones.</p>

<p>The roar of pillage and slaughter faded into the distance; only
the smoke stood up among the hills, mute witness of the horror.</p>

<p>Akbar laughed gustily. "By Allah!" he swore, smiting his
saddlebow, "these Kharesmians are woundy fighters! They ride like
Tatars and slay like Turks! Right well would I lead them into
battle! I had rather fight beside them than against them."</p>

<p>Cahal made no reply. His strange companion seemed to him like a
faun, a soulless fantastic being full of titanic laughter at all
human things&mdash;a creature outside the boundaries of men's
dreams and reverences.</p>

<p>Akbar spoke abruptly. "Here our roads part for a space,
<i>malik</i>; your road lies to Ascalon&mdash;mine to El
Kahira."</p>

<p>"Why to Cairo, Akbar, or Haroun, or whatever your name is?"
asked Cahal.</p>

<p>"Because I have business with that great oaf, Baibars, whom the
devil fly away with!" yelled Akbar, and his shout of laughter
floated back above the hoof-beats.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
It was hours later when Cahal, pushing his horse as hard as he
dared, met the travelers&mdash;a slender knight in full mail and
vizored helmet, with a single attendant, a big carle with a rough
red beard, who wore a horned helmet and a shirt of scale-mail and
bore a heavy ax. Something slumbering stirred in Cahal as he looked
on that fierce bluff face, and he reined in.</p>

<p>"Man, where have I seen you before?"</p>

<p>The fierce frosty eyes met him levelly.</p>

<p>"By Odin, that I can't say. I'm Wulfgar the Dane and this is my
master."</p>

<p>Cahal glanced at the silent knight with his plain shield.
Through the bars of the vizor, shadowed eyes looked at
him&mdash;great God! A shock went through Cahal, leaving him
bewildered and shaken with a thousand racing chaotic thoughts. He
leaned forward, striving to peer through the lowered vizor, and the
knight drew back with an almost womanish gesture of rebuke. Cahal
reddened.</p>

<p>"I crave your pardon, sir," he said. "I did not intend this
seeming rudeness."</p>

<p>"My master has taken a vow not to speak or reveal his features
until he has accomplished his penance," broke in the rough Dane.
"He is known as the Masked Knight. We journey to Jerusalem."</p>

<p>Sorrowfully Cahal shook his head.</p>

<p>"No Christian may ride thither. The paynim from the outer
steppes have swept over the walls and the Holy of Holies lies in
smoking ruins."</p>

<p>The Dane's bearded mouth gaped.</p>

<p>"Jerusalem&mdash;taken?" he mouthed stupidly. "Why, good sir,
that can not be! How would God allow his Holy City to fall into the
hands of the infidels?"</p>

<p>"I know not," said Cahal bitterly. "The ways of God and His
infinite mercy are past my knowledge&mdash;but the streets of
Jerusalem run with the blood of His people and the Sepulcher is
black with the flames of the heathen."</p>

<p>Perplexed, the Dane tugged at his red beard and glanced at his
master, sitting image-like in the saddle.</p>

<p>"By Odin," he growled, "what are we to do now?"</p>

<p>"There is but one thing to be done," answered Cahal. "Ride back
to Ascalon and give warning. I was going thither, but if you will
do this thing, I will seek Walter de Brienne. Tell the Seneschal of
Ascalon that Jerusalem has fallen to heathen Turks of the outer
steppes, known as Kharesmians, who number some ten thousand men.
Bid him arm for war&mdash;and let no grass grow under your horses'
hoofs in going."</p>

<p>And Cahal reined aside and took the road for Jaffa.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="sowers6" name="sowers6">CHAPTER 6</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">CAHAL found Walter de Brienne in Ramlah, brooding
in the White Mosque over the sepulcher of Saint George. Fainting
with weariness the Gael told his tale in a few stark bare words,
and even they seemed to drag leaden and lifeless from his blackened
lips. He was but dimly aware that men led him into a house and laid
him on a couch. And there he slept the sun around.</p>

<p>He woke to a deserted city. Horror-stricken, the people of
Ramlah had gathered up their belongings and fled along the road to
Jaffa, crying that the end of the world was come. But Walter de
Brienne had ridden north, leaving a single man-at-arms to bid Cahal
follow him to Acre. The Gael rode through the hollow-echoing
streets, feeling like a ghost in a dead city. The western gates
swung idly open and a spear lay on the worn flags, as if the watch
had dropped their weapons and fled in a sudden panic.</p>

<p>Cahal rode through the fields of date-palms and groves of
figtrees hugging the shadow of the wall, and out on the plain he
overtook staggering crowds of frantic folk burdened with their
goods and crying with weariness and thirst. When the fugitives saw
Cahal they screamed with fear to know if the slayers were upon
them. He shook his head, pushing through. It seemed logical to him
that the Kharesmians would sweep on to the sea, and their path
might well take them by Ramlah. But as he rode he scanned the
horizon behind him and saw neither smoke-rack nor dust cloud.</p>

<p>He left the Jaffa road with its hurrying throngs, and swung
north. Already the tale had passed like wildfire from mouth to
mouth. The villages were deserted as the folk thronged to the coast
towns or retired into towers on the heights. Christian Outremer
stood with its back to the sea, facing the onrushing menace out of
the East.</p>

<p>Cahal rode into Acre, where the waning powers of Outremer were
already gathering&mdash;hawk-eyed knights in worn mail&mdash;the
barons with their wolfish men-at-arms. Sultan Ismail of Damascus
had sent swift emissaries urging an alliance&mdash;which had been
quickly accepted. Knights of St. John from their great grim Krak
des Chevaliers, Templars with their red skull-caps and untrimmed
beards rode in from all parts of the kingdom&mdash;the grim silent
watchdogs of Outremer.</p>

<p>Survivors had drifted into Ascalon and Jaffa&mdash;lame, weary
folk, a bare handful who had escaped the torch and sword and
survived the hardships of the flight.</p>

<p>They told tales of horror. Seven thousand Christians, mostly
women and children, had perished in the sack of Jerusalem. The Holy
Sepulcher had been blackened by flame, the altars of the city
shattered, the shrines burned with fire. Moslem had suffered with
Christian. The patriarch was among the fugitives&mdash;saved from
death by the valor and faithfulness of a nameless Rhinelander
man-at-arms, who hid a cruel wound until he said, "Yonder be the
towers of Ascalon, master, and since you have no more need o' me,
I'll lie me down and sleep, for I be sore weary." And he died in
the dust of the road.</p>

<p>And word came of the Kharesmian horde; they had not tarried long
in the broken city, but swept on, down through the deserts of the
south, to Gaza, where they lay encamped at last after their long
drift. And pregnant, mysterious hints floated up from the blue web
of the South, and de Brienne sent for Cahal O'Donnel.</p>

<p>"Good sir," said the baron, "my spies tell me that a host of
memluks is advancing from Egypt. Their object is obvious&mdash;to
take possession of the city the Kharesmians left desolate. But what
else? There are hints of an alliance between the memluks and the
nomads. If this be the case, we may as well be shriven before we go
into battle, for we can not stand against both hosts.</p>

<p>"The men of Damascus cry out against the Kharesmians for
befouling holy places&mdash;Moslem as well as Christian&mdash;but
these memluks are of Turkish blood, and who knows the mind of
Baibars, their master?</p>

<p>"Sir Cahal, will you ride to Baibars and parley with him? You
saw with your own eyes the sack of Jerusalem and can tell him the
truth of how the pagans befouled Al Aksa as well as the Sepulcher.
After all, he is a Moslem. At least learn if he means to join hands
with these devils.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, when the cohorts of Damascus come up, we advance
southward to go against the foe ere he can come against us. Ride
you ahead of the host as emissary under a flag of truce, with as
many men as you wish."</p>

<p>"Give me the flag," said Cahal. "I'll ride alone."</p>

<p>He rode out of the camp before sunset on a palfrey, bearing the
flag of peace and without his sword. Only a battle-ax hung at his
saddlebow as a precaution against bandits who respected no flag, as
he rode south through a half-deserted land. He guided his course by
the words of the wandering Arab herdsmen who knew all things that
went on in the land. And beyond Ascalon he learned that the host
had crossed the Jifar and was encamped to the southeast of Gaza.
The close proximity to the Kharesmians made him wary and he swung
far to the east to avoid any scouts of the pagans who might be
combing the countryside. He had no trust in the peace-token as a
safeguard against the barbarians.</p>

<p>He rode, in a dreamy twilight, into the Egyptian camp which lay
about a cluster of wells a bare league from Gaza. Misgivings smote
him as he noted their arms, their numbers, their evident
discipline. He dismounted, displaying the peace-gonfalcon and his
empty sword-belt. The wild memluks in their silvered mail and heron
feathers swarmed about him in sinister silence, as if minded to try
their curved blades on his flesh, but they escorted him to a
spacious silk pavilion in the midst of the camp.</p>

<p>Black slaves with wide-tipped scimitars stood ranged about the
entrance and from within a great voice&mdash;strangely
familiar&mdash;boomed a song.</p>

<p>"This is the pavilion of the amir, even Baibars the Panther,
<i>Caphar</i>," growled a bearded Turk, and Cahal said as haughtily
as if he sat on his lost throne amid his gallaglachs, "Lead me to
your lord, dog, and announce me with due respect."</p>

<p>The eyes of the gaudily clad ruffian fell sullenly, and with a
reluctant salaam he obeyed. Cahal strode into the silken tent and
heard the memluk boom: "The lord Kizil Malik, emissary from the
barons of Palestine!"</p>

<p>In the great pavilion a single huge candle on a lacquered table
shed a golden light; the chiefs of Egypt sprawled about on silken
cushions, quaffing the forbidden wine. And dominating the scene, a
tall broad figure in voluminous silken trousers, satin vest, a
broad cloth-of-gold girdle&mdash;without a doubt Baibars, the ogre
of the South. And Cahal caught his breath&mdash;that coarse red
hair&mdash;that square dark face&mdash;those blazing blue eyes
&mdash;</p>

<p>"I bid you welcome, lord <i>Caphar</i>," boomed Baibars. "What
news do you bring?"</p>

<p>"You were Haroun the Traveler," said Cahal slowly, "and at
Jerusalem you were Akbar the Soldier."</p>

<p>Baibars rocked with laughter.</p>

<p>"By Allah!" he roared, "I bear a scar on my head to this day as
a relic of that night's bout in Damietta! By Allah, you gave me a
woundy clout!"</p>

<p>"You play your parts like a mummer," said Cahal. "But what
reason for these deceptions?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Baibars, "I trust no spy but myself, for one thing.
For another it makes life worth living. I did not lie when I told
you that night in Damietta that I was celebrating my escape from
Baibars. By Allah, the affairs of the world weigh heavily on
Baibars' shoulders, but Haroun the Traveler, he is a mad and merry
rogue with a free mind and a roving foot. I play the mummer and
escape from myself, and try to be true to each part&mdash;so long
as I play it. Sit ye and drink!"</p>

<p>Cahal shook his head. All his carefully thought out plans of
diplomacy fell away, futile as dust. He struck straight and spoke
bluntly and to the point.</p>

<p>"A word and my task is done, Baibars," he said. "I come to find
whether you mean to join hands with the pagans who desecrated the
Sepulcher&mdash;and Al Aksa."</p>

<p>Baibars drank and considered, though Cahal knew well that the
Tatar had already made up his mind, long before.</p>

<p>"Al Kuds is mine for the taking," he said lazily. "I will
cleanse the mosques&mdash;aye, by Allah, the Kharesmians shall do
the work, most piously. They'll make good Moslems. And winged
war-men. With them I sow the thunder&mdash;who reaps the
tempest?"</p>

<p>"Yet you fought against them at Jerusalem," Cahal reminded
bitterly.</p>

<p>"Aye," frankly admitted the amir, "but there they would have cut
my throat as quick as any Frank's. I could not say to them: 'Hold,
dogs, I am Baibars!'"</p>

<p>Cahal bowed his lion-like head, knowing the futility of
arguing.</p>

<p>"Then my work is done; I demand safe-conduct from your
camp."</p>

<p>Baibars shook his head, grinning. "Nay, <i>malik</i>, you are
thirsty and weary. Bide here as my guest."</p>

<p>Cahal's hand moved involuntarily toward his empty girdle.
Baibars was smiling but his eyes glittered between narrowed lids
and the slaves about him half-drew their scimitars.</p>

<p>"You'd keep me prisoner despite the fact that I am an
ambassador?"</p>

<p>"You came without invitation," grinned Baibars. "I ask no
parley. Di Zaro!"</p>

<p>A tall lank Venetian in black velvet stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Di Zaro," said Baibars in a jesting voice, "the <i>malik</i>
Cahal is our guest. Mount ye and ride like the devil to the host of
the Franks. There say that Cahal sent you secretly. Say that the
lord Cahal is twisting that great fool Baibars about his finger,
and pledges to keep him aloof from the battle."</p>

<p>The Venetian grinned bleakly and left the tent, avoiding Cahal's
smoldering eyes. The Gael knew that the trade-lusting Italians were
often in secret league with the Moslems, but few stooped so low as
this renegade.</p>

<p>"Well, Baibars," said Cahal with a shrug of his shoulders,
"since you must play the dog, there is naught I can do. I have no
sword."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that," responded Baibars candidly. "Come, fret not.
It is but your misfortune to oppose Baibars and his destiny. Men
are my tools&mdash; at the Damascus Gate I knew that those
red-handed riders were steel to forge into a Moslem sword. By
Allah, <i>malik</i>, if you could have seen me riding like the wind
into Egypt&mdash;marching back across the Jifar without pausing to
rest! Riding into the camp of the pagans with mullahs shouting the
advantages of Islam! Convincing their wild Kuran Shah that his only
safety lay in conversion and alliance!</p>

<p>"I do not fully trust the wolves, and have pitched my camp apart
from them&mdash;but when the Franks come up, they will find our
hordes joined for battle&mdash;and should be horribly surprized, if
that dog di Zaro does his work well!"</p>

<p>"Your treachery makes me a dog in the eyes of my people," said
Cahal bitterly.</p>

<p>"None will call you traitor," said Baibars serenely, "because
soon all will cease to be. Relics of an outworn age, I will rid the
land of them. Be at ease!"</p>

<p>He extended a brimming goblet and Cahal took it, sipped at it
absently, and began to pace up and down the pavilion, as a man
paces in worry and despair. The memluks watched him, grinning
surreptitiously.</p>

<p>"Well," said Baibars, "I was a Tatar prince, I was a slave, and
I will be a prince again. Kuran Shah's shaman read the stars for
me&mdash;and he says that if I win the battle against the Franks, I
will be sultan of Egypt!"</p>

<p>The amir was sure of his chiefs, thought Cahal, to thus flaunt
his ambition openly. The Gael said, "The Franks care not who is
sultan of Egypt."</p>

<p>"Aye, but battles and the corpses of men are stairs whereby I
climb to fame. Each war I win clinches my hold on power. Now the
Franks stand in my path; I will brush them aside. But the shaman
prophesied a strange thing&mdash;that a dead man's sword will deal
me a grievous hurt when the Franks come up against us&mdash;"</p>

<p>From the corner of his eye Cahal saw that his apparently aimless
strides had taken him close to the table on which stood the great
candle. He lifted the goblet toward his lips, then with a lightning
flick of his wrist, dashed the wine onto the flame. It sputtered
and went out, plunging the tent into total darkness. And
simultaneously Cahal ripped a hidden dirk from under his arm and
like a steel spring released, bounded toward the place where he
knew Baibars sat.</p>

<p>He catapulted into somebody in the dark and his dirk hummed and
sank home. A death scream ripped the clamor and the Gael wrenched
the blade free and sprang away. No time for another stroke. Men
yelled and fell over each other and steel clanged wildly. Cahal's
crimsoned blade ripped a long slit in the silk of the tent-wall and
he sprang into the outer starlight where men were shouting and
running toward the pavilion.</p>

<p>Behind him a bull-like bellowing told the Gael that his blindly
stabbing dirk had found some other flesh than Baibars'. He ran
swiftly toward the horse-lines, leaping over taut tent-ropes, a
shadow among a thousand racing figures. A mounted sentry came
galloping through the confusion, firelight gleaming on his drawn
scimitar. As a panther leaps Cahal sprang, landing behind the
saddle. The memluk's startled yell broke in a gurgle as the keen
dirk crossed his throat.</p>

<p>Flinging the corpse to the earth, the Gael quieted the snorting,
plunging steed and reined it away. Like the wind he rode through
the swarming camp and the free air of the desert struck his face.
He gave the Arab horse the rein and heard the clamor of pursuit die
away behind him.</p>

<p>Somewhere to the north lay the slowly advancing host of the
Christians, and Cahal rode north. He hoped to overtake the Venetian
on the road, but the other had too long a start. Men who rode for
Baibars rode with a flowing rein.</p>

<p>The Franks were breaking camp at dawn when a Venetian rode
headlong into their lines, gasping a tale of escape and flight, and
demanding to see de Brienne.</p>

<p>Within the baron's half-dismantled tent, di Zaro gasped: "The
lord Cahal sent me, <i>seigneur</i>&mdash;he holds Baibars in
parley. He gives his word that the memluks will not join the
Kharesmians, and urges you to press forward&mdash;"</p>

<p>Outside a clatter of hoofs split the din&mdash;a lone rider
whose flying hair was like a veil of blood against the crimson of
dawn. At de Brienne's tent the hard-checked steed slid to its
haunches. Cahal leaped to the earth and rushed in like an avenging
blast. Di Zaro cried out and paled, frozen by his doom&mdash;till
Cahal's dirk split his heart and the Venetian rolled, an
earthen-faced corpse, to Walter de Brienne's feet. The baron sprang
up, bewildered.</p>

<p>"Cahal! What news, in God's name?"</p>

<p>"Baibars joins arms with the pagans," answered Cahal.</p>

<p>De Brienne bowed his head.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;no man can ask to live forever."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="sowers7" name="sowers7">CHAPTER 7</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THROUGH the drear gray dusty desert the host of
Outremer crawled southward. The black and white standard of the
Templars floated beside the cross of the patriarch, and the black
banners of Damascus billowed in the faintly stirring air. No king
led them. The Emperor Frederick claimed the kingship of Jerusalem
and he skulked in Sicily, plotting against the pope. De Brienne had
been chosen to lead the barons and he shared his command with Al
Mansur el Haman, warlord of Damascus.</p>

<p>They went into camp within sight of the Moslem outposts, and all
night the wind that blew up from the south throbbed with the beat
of drums and the clash of cymbals. Scouts reported the movements of
the Kharesmian horde, and that the memluks had joined them.</p>

<p>In the gray light of dawn Red Cahal came from his tent fully
armed. On all sides the host was moving, striking tents and
buckling armor. In the illusive light Cahal saw them moving like
phantoms&mdash;the tall patriarch, shriving and blessing; the giant
form of the Master of the Temple among his grim war-dogs; the
heron-feathered gold helmet of Al Mansur. And he stiffened as he
saw a slim mailed shape moving through the swarm, followed close by
a rough figure with ax on shoulder.</p>

<p>Bewildered, he shook his head&mdash;why did his heart pound so
strangely at sight of that mysterious Masked Knight? Of whom did
the slim youth remind him, and of what dim bitter memories? He felt
as one plunged into a web of illusion.</p>

<p>And now a familiar figure fell upon Cahal and embraced him.</p>

<p>"By Allah!" swore Shaykh Suleyman ibn Omad, "but for thee I had
slept in the ruins of my keep! They came like the wind, those dogs,
but they found the gates closed, the archers on the walls&mdash;and
after one assault, they passed on to easier prey! Ride with me this
day, my son!"</p>

<p>Cahal assented, liking the lean hearty old desert hawk. And so
it was in the glittering, plume-helmeted ranks of Damascus the Gael
rode to battle.</p>

<p>In the dawn they moved forward, no more than twelve thousand men
to meet the memluks and nomads&mdash;fifteen thousand warriors, not
counting light- armed irregulars. In the center of the right wing
the Templars held their accustomed place, in advance of the rest;
five hundred grim iron men, flanked on one side by the Knights of
St. John and the Teutonic Knights, some three hundred in all; and
on the other by the handful of barons with the patriarch and his
iron mace. The combined forces of their men-at-arms did not exceed
seven thousand. The rest of the host consisted of the cavalry of
Damascus, in the center of the army, and the warriors of the amir
of Kerak who held the left wing&mdash;lean hawk-faced Arabs better
at raiding than at fighting pitched battles.</p>

<p>Now the desert blackened ahead of them with the swarms of their
foes, and the drums throbbed and bellowed. The warriors of Damascus
sang and chanted, but the men of the Cross were silent, like men
riding to a known doom. Cahal, riding beside Al Mansur and Shaykh
Suleyman, let his gaze sweep down those grim gray-mailed ranks, and
found that which he sought. Again his heart leaped curiously at the
sight of the slim Masked Knight, riding close to the patriarch.
Close at the knight's side bobbed the horned helmet of the Dane.
Cahal cursed, bewilderedly.</p>

<p>And now both hosts advanced, the dark swarms of the desert
riders moving ahead of the ordered ranks of the memluks. The
Kharesmians trotted forward in some formation, and Cahal saw the
Crusaders close their ranks to meet the charge, without slackening
their even pace. The wild riders struck in the rowels and the dark
swarm rolled swiftly across the sands; then suddenly they shifted
as a crafty swordsman shifts. Wheeling in perfect order they swept
past the front of the knights and bursting into a headlong run,
thundered down on the banners of Damascus.</p>

<p>The trick, born in the brain of Baibars, took the whole allied
host by surprize. The Arabs yelled and prepared to meet the onset,
but they were bewildered by the mad fury and numbing speed of that
charge.</p>

<p>Riding like madmen the Kharesmians bent their heavy bows and
shot from the saddle, and clouds of feathered shafts hummed before
them. The leather bucklers and light mail of the Arabs were useless
against those whistling missiles, and along the Damascus front
warriors fell like ripe grain. Al Mansur was screaming commands for
a countercharge, but in the teeth of that deadly blast the dazed
Arabs milled helplessly, and in the midst of the confusion, the
charge crashed into their lines. Cahal saw again the broad squat
figures, the wild dark faces, the madly hacking
scimitars&mdash;broader and heavier than the light Damascus blades.
He felt again the irresistible concussion of the Kharesmian
charge.</p>

<p>His great red stallion staggered to the impact and a whistling
blade shivered on his shield. He stood up in his stirrups, slashing
right and left, and felt mail-mesh part under his edge, saw
headless corpses drop from their saddles. Up and down the line the
blades were flashing like spray in the sun and the Damascus ranks
were breaking and melting away. Man to man, the Arabs might have
held fast; but dazed and outnumbered, that demoralizing rain of
arrows had begun the rout that the curved swords completed.</p>

<p>Cahal, hurled back with the rest, vainly striving to hold his
ground as he slashed and thrust, heard old Suleyman ibn Omad
cursing like a fiend beside him as his scimitar wove a shining
wheel of death about his head.</p>

<p>"Dogs and sons of dogs!" yelled the old hawk. "Had ye stood but
a moment, the day had been yours! By Allah, pagan, will ye press me
close?&mdash;So! Ha! Now carry your head to Hell in your hand! Ho,
children, rally to me and the lord Cahal! My son, keep at my side.
The fight is already lost and we must hack clear."</p>

<p>Suleyman's hawks reined in about him and Cahal, and the compact
little knot of desperate men slashed through, riding down the
snarling wolfish shapes that barred their path, and so rode out of
the red frenzy of the melee into the open desert. The Damascus
clans were in full flight, their black banners streaming
ingloriously behind them. Yet there was no shame to be attached to
them. That unexpected charge had simply swept them away, like a
shattered dam before a torrent.</p>

<p>On the left wing the amir of Kerak was giving back, his ranks
crumbling before the singing arrows and flying blades of tribesmen.
So far the memluks had taken no part in the battle, but now they
rode forward and Cahal saw the huge form of Baibars galloping into
the fray, beating the howling nomads from their flying prey and
reforming their straggling lines.</p>

<p>The wolfskin-clad riders swung about and trotted across the
sands, reinforced by the memluks in their silvered mail and
heron-feathered helmets. So suddenly had the storm burst that
before the Franks could wheel their ponderous lines to support the
center, their Arab allies were broken and flying. But the men of
the Cross came doggedly onward.</p>

<p>"Now the real death-grip," grunted Suleyman, "with but one
possible end. By Allah, my head was not made to dangle at a pagan's
saddlebow. The road to the desert is open to us&mdash;ha, my son,
are you mad?"</p>

<p>For Cahal wheeled away, jerking his rein from the clutching hand
of the protesting Shaykh. Across the corpse-littered plain he
galloped toward the gray-steel ranks that swept inexorably
onward.</p>

<p>The Shaykh cried out again, seeking to halt this mad dash.</p>

<p>Riding hard, he swept into line just as the oliphants trumpeted
for the onset. With a deep-throated roar the knights of the Cross
charged to meet the onrushing hordes through a barbed and feathered
cloud. Heads down, grimly facing the singing shafts that could not
check them, the knights swept on in their last charge. With an
earthquake shock the two hosts crashed together, and this time it
was the Kharesmian horde which staggered.</p>

<p>The long lances of the Templars ripped their foremost line to
shreds and the great chargers of the Crusaders overthrew horse and
rider. Close on the heels of the warrior-monks thundered the rest
of the Christian host, swords flashing. Dazed in their turn, the
wild riders in their wolfskins reeled backward, howling and plying
their deadly blades. But the long swords of the Europeans hacked
through iron mesh and steel plate, to split skulls and bosoms.
Squat corpses choked the ground under their horses' hoofs, as deep
into the heart of the disorganized horde the knights slashed, and
the yells of the tribesmen changed to howls of dismay as the whole
battle-mass surged backward.</p>

<p>And now Baibars, seeing the battle tremble in the balance,
deployed swiftly, skirted the ragged edge of the melee and hurled
his memluks like a thunderbolt at the back of the Crusaders. The
fresh, unwearied Bahairiz struck home, and the Franks found
themselves hemmed in on all sides, as the wavering Kharesmians
stiffened and with a fresh resurge of confidence renewed the
fight.</p>

<p>Leaguered all about, the Christians fell fast, but even in dying
they took bitter toll. Back to back, in a slowly shrinking ring
facing outward, about a rocky knoll on which was planted the
patriarch's cross, the last host of Outremer made its last
stand.</p>

<p>Until the red stallion fell dying, Red Cahal fought in the
saddle, and then he joined the ring of men on foot. In the berserk
fury that gripped him, he felt not the sting of wounds. Time faded
in an eternity of plunging bodies and frantic steel; of chaotic,
wild figures that smote and died. In a red maze he saw a
gold-mailed figure roll under his sword, and knew, in a brief
passing flash of triumph, that he had slain Kuran Shah, khan of the
horde. And remembering Jerusalem, he ground the dying face under
his mailed heel. And the grim fight raged on. Beside Cahal fell the
grim Master of the Temple, the Seneschal of Ascalon, the lord of
Acre. The thin ring of defenders staggered beneath the repeated
charges; blood blinded them, the heat of the sun smote fierce upon
them, they were choked with dust and maddened with wounds. Yet with
broken swords and notched axes they smote, and against that iron
ring Baibars hurled his slayers again and again, and again and
again he saw his hordes stagger back broken.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking toward the horizon when, foaming with rage
that for once drowned his gargantuan laughter, he launched an
irresistible charge upon the dying handful that tore them apart and
scattered their corpses over the plain.</p>

<p>Here and there single knights or weary groups, like the drift of
a storm, were ridden down by the chanting riders who swarmed the
plain.</p>

<p>Cahal O'Donnel walked dazedly among the dead, the notched and
crimsoned sword trailing in his weary hand. His helmet was gone,
his arms and legs gashed, and from a deep wound beneath his
hauberk, blood trickled sluggishly.</p>

<p>And suddenly his head jerked up.</p>

<p>"Cahal! Cahal!"</p>

<p>He drew an uncertain hand across his eyes. Surely the delirium
of battle was upon him. But again the voice rose, in agony.</p>

<p>"Cahal!"</p>

<p>He was close to a boulder-strewn knoll where the dead lay thick.
Among them lay Wulfgar the Dane, his unshaven lip a-snarl, his red
beard tilted truculently, even in death. His mighty hand still
gripped his ax, notched and clotted red, and a gory heap of corpses
beneath him gave mute evidence of his berserk fury.</p>

<p>"Cahal!"</p>

<p>The Gael dropped to his knees beside the slender figure of the
Masked Knight. He lifted off the helmet&mdash;to reveal a wealth of
unruly black tresses&mdash;gray eyes luminous and deep. A choked
cry escaped him.</p>

<p>"Saints of God! Elinor! I dream&mdash;this is
madness&mdash;"</p>

<p>The slender mailed arms groped about his neck. The eyes misted
with growing blindness. Through the pliant links of the hauberk
blood seeped steadily.</p>

<p>"You are not mad, Red Cahal," she whispered. "You do not dream.
I am come to you at last&mdash;though I find you but in death. I
did you a deathly wrong&mdash;and only when you were gone from me
forever did I know I loved you.</p>

<p>Oh, Cahal, we were born under a blind unquiet star&mdash;both
seeking goals of fire and mist. I loved you&mdash;and knew it not
until I lost you. You were gone&mdash;and I knew not where.</p>

<p>"The Lady Elinor de Courcey died then, and in her place was born
the Masked Knight. I took the Cross in penance. Only one faithful
servitor knew my secret&mdash;and rode with me&mdash;to the ends of
the earth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aye," muttered Cahal, "I remember him now&mdash;even in death
he was faithful."</p>

<p>"When I met you among the hills below Jerusalem," she whispered
faintly, "my heart tore at its strings to burst from my bosom and
fall in the dust at your feet. But I dared not reveal myself to
you. Ah, Cahal, I have done bitter penance! I have died for the
Cross this day, like a knight. But I ask not forgiveness of God.
Let Him do with me as He will&mdash;but oh, it is forgiveness of
you I crave, and dare not ask!"</p>

<p>"I freely forgive you," said Cahal heavily. "Fret no more about
it, girl; it was but a little wrong, after all. Faith, all things
and the deeds and dreams of men are fleeting and unstable as
moon-mist, even the world which has here ended."</p>

<p>"Then kiss me," she gasped, fighting hard against the onrushing
darkness.</p>

<p>Cahal passed his arm under her shoulders, lifting her to his
blackened lips. With a convulsive effort she stiffened half-erect
in his arms, her eyes blazing with a strange light.</p>

<p>"The sun sets and the world ends!" she cried. "But I see a crown
of red gold on your head, Red Cahal, and I shall sit beside you on
a throne of glory! Hail, Cahal, chief of Uland; hail, Cahal Ruadh,
<i>ard-ri na Eireann</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>She sank back, blood starting from her lips. Cahal eased her to
the earth and rose like a man in a dream. He turned toward the low
slope and staggered with a passing wave of dizziness. The sun was
sinking toward the desert's rim. To his eyes the whole plain seemed
veiled in a mist of blood through which vague phantasmal figures
moved in ghostly pageantry. A chaotic clamor rose like the acclaim
to a king, and it seemed to him that all the shouts merged into one
thunderous roar: <i>"Hail, Cahal Ruadh, ard-ri na Eireann!"</i></p>

<p>He shook the mists from his brain and laughed. He strode down
the slope, and a group of hawklike riders swept down upon him with
a swift rattle of hoofs. A bow twanged and an iron arrowhead
smashed through his mail. With a laugh he tore it out and blood
flooded his hauberk. A lance thrust at his throat and he caught the
shaft in his left hand, lunging upward. The gray sword's point rent
through the rider's mail, and his death-scream was still echoing
when Cahal stepped aside from the slash of a scimitar and hacked
off the hand that wielded it. A spear-point bent on the links of
his mail and the lean gray sword leaped like a serpent-stroke,
splitting helmet and head, spilling the rider from the saddle.</p>

<p>Cahal dropped his point to the earth and stood with bare head
thrown back, as a gleaming clump of horsemen swept by. The foremost
reined his white horse back on its haunches with a shout of
laughter. And so the victor faced the vanquished. Behind Cahal the
sun was setting in a sea of blood, and his hair, floating in the
rising breeze, caught the last glints of the sun, so that it seemed
to Baibars the Gael wore a misty crown of red gold.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>malik</i>," laughed the Tatar, "they who oppose the
destiny of Baibars lie under my horses' hoofs, and over them I ride
up the gleaming stair of empire!"</p>

<p>Cahal laughed and blood started from his lips. With a lion-like
gesture he threw up his head, flinging high his sword in kingly
salute.</p>

<p>"Lord of the East!" his voice rang like a trumpet-call, "welcome
to the fellowship of kings! To the glory and the witch-fire, the
gold and the moon- mist, the splendor and the death! Baibars, a
king hails thee!"</p>

<p>And he leaped and struck as a tiger leaps. Not Baibars' stallion
that screamed and reared, not his trained swordsmen, not his own
quickness could have saved the memluk then. Death alone saved
him&mdash;death that took the Gael in the midst of his leap. Red
Cahal died in midair and it was a corpse that crashed against
Baibars' saddle&mdash;a falling sword in a dead hand, that, the
momentum of the blow completing its arc, scarred Baibar's forehead
and split his eyeball.</p>

<p>His warriors shouted and reined forward. Baibars slumped in the
saddle, sick with agony, blood gushing from between the fingers
that gripped his wound. As his chiefs cried out and sought to aid
him, he lifted his head and saw, with his single, pain-dimmed eye,
Red Cahal lying dead at his horse's feet. A smile was on the Gael's
lips, and the gray sword lay in shards beside him, shattered, by
some freak of chance, on the stones as it fell beside the
wielder.</p>

<p>"A hakim, in the name of Allah," groaned Baibars. "I am a dead
man."</p>

<p>"Nay, you are not dead, my lord," said one of his memluk chiefs.
"It is the wound from the dead man's sword and it is grievous
enough, but bethink you: here has the host of the Franks ceased to
be. The barons are all taken or slain and the Cross of the
patriarch has fallen. Such of the Kharesmians as live are ready to
serve you as their new lord&mdash;since Kizil Malik slew their
khan. The Arabs have fled and Damascus lies helpless before
you&mdash;and Jerusalem is ours! You will yet be sultan of
Egypt."</p>

<p>"I have conquered," answered Baibars, shaken for the first time
in his wild life, "but I am half-blind&mdash;and of what avail to
slay men of that breed? They will come again and again and again,
riding to death like a feast because of the restlessness of their
souls, through all the centuries. What though we prevail this
little Now? They are a race unconquerable, and at last, in a year
or a thousand years, they will trample Islam under their feet and
ride again through the streets of Jerusalem."</p>

<p>And over the red field of battle night fell shuddering.</p>
