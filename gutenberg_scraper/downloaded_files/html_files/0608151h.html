<h3>PRODUCTION NOTE</h3>

<p class="first">THIS story was originally published with two
different endings in the December 1936 issue of <i>Smashing Novels
Magazine</i> under the title "The Vultures of Whapeton." It was
preceded by the following note from the editor, Cliff Campbell:</p>
<br>

<p class="quote">"Of course, giving a story two endings is sort of
unorthodox. But <i>Smashing Novels</i>, ever since its first issue,
hasn't been a particularly orthodox magazine. We've tried, and we
are trying, to give you different stories with different slants,
and we've been doing our darndest to give you the best stories
possible."</p>

<p>The present PGA/RGL e-book edition conforms with the version
published in <i>Smashing Novels Magazine</i>, except for correcting
the spelling of the scene of action from "Whapeton" to
"Wahpeton."</p>

<h2><a id="vultures1" name="vultures1">I. &mdash; GUNS IN THE
DARK</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE bare plank walls of the Golden Eagle Saloon
seemed still to vibrate with the crashing echoes of the guns which
had split the sudden darkness with spurts of red. But only a
nervous shuffling of booted feet sounded in the tense silence that
followed the shots. Then somewhere a match rasped on leather and a
yellow flicker sprang up, etching a shaky hand and a pallid face.
An instant later an oil lamp with a broken chimney illuminated the
saloon, throwing tense bearded faces into bold relief. The big lamp
that hung from the ceiling was a smashed ruin; kerosene dripped
from it to the floor, making an oily puddle beside a grimmer,
darker pool.</p>

<p>Two figures held the center of the room, under the broken lamp.
One lay facedown, motionless arms outstretching empty hands. The
other was crawling to his feet, blinking and gaping stupidly, like
a man whose wits are still muddled by drink. His right arm hung
limply by his side, a long-barreled pistol sagging from his
fingers.</p>

<p>The rigid line of figures along the bar melted into movement.
Men came forward, stooping to stare down at the limp shape. A
confused babble of conversation rose. Hurried steps sounded
outside, and the crowd divided as a man pushed his way abruptly
through. Instantly he dominated the scene. His broad-shouldered,
trim-hipped figure was above medium height, and his broad-brimmed
white hat, neat boots and cravat contrasted with the rough garb of
the others, just as his keen, dark face with its narrow black
mustache contrasted with the bearded countenances about him. He
held an ivory-butted gun in his right hand, muzzle tilted
upward.</p>

<p>"What devil's work is this?" he harshly demanded; and then his
gaze fell on the man on the floor. His eyes widened.</p>

<p>"Grimes!" he ejaculated. "Jim Grimes, my deputy! Who did this?"
There was something tigerish about him as he wheeled toward the
uneasy crowd. "Who did this?" he demanded, half-crouching, his gun
still lifted, but seeming to hover like a live thing ready to
swoop.</p>

<p>Feet shuffled as men backed away, but one man spoke up: "We
don't know, Middleton. Jackson there was havin' a little fun,
shootin' at the ceilin', and the rest of us was at the bar,
watchin' him, when Grimes come in and started to arrest
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So Jackson shot him!" snarled Middleton, his gun covering the
befuddled one in a baffling blur of motion. Jackson yelped in fear
and threw up his hands, and the man who had first spoken
interposed.</p>

<p>"No, Sheriff, it couldn't have been Jackson. His gun was empty
when the lights went out. I know he slung six bullets into the
ceilin' while he was playin' the fool, and I heard him snap the gun
three times afterwards, so I know it was empty. But when Grimes
went up to him, somebody shot the light out, and a gun banged in
the dark, and when we got a light on again, there Grimes was on the
floor, and Jackson was just gettin' up."</p>

<p>"I didn't shoot him," muttered Jackson. "I was just havin' a
little fun. I was drunk, but I ain't now. I wouldn't have resisted
arrest. When the light went out I didn't know what had happened. I
heard the gun bang, and Grimes dragged me down with him as he fell.
I didn't shoot him. I dunno who did."</p>

<p>"None of us knows," added a bearded miner. "Somebody shot in the
dark&mdash;"</p>

<p>"More'n one," muttered another. "I heard at least three or four
guns speakin'."</p>

<p>Silence followed, in which each man looked sidewise at his
neighbor. The men had drawn back to the bar, leaving the middle of
the big room clear, where the sheriff stood. Suspicion and fear
galvanized the crowd, leaping like an electric spark from man to
man. Each man knew that a murderer stood near him, possibly at his
elbow. Men refused to look directly into the eyes of their
neighbors, fearing to surprise guilty knowledge there&mdash;and die
for the discovery. They stared at the sheriff who stood facing
them, as if expecting to see him fall suddenly before a blast from
the same unknown guns that had mowed down his deputy.</p>

<p>Middleton's steely eyes ranged along the silent line of men.
Their eyes avoided or gave back his stare. In some he read fear;
some were inscrutable; in others flickered a sinister mockery.</p>

<p>"The men who killed Jim Grimes are in this saloon," he said
finally. "Some of you are the murderers." He was careful not to let
his eyes single out anyone when he spoke; they swept the whole
assemblage.</p>

<p>"I've been expecting this. Things have been getting a little too
hot for the robbers and murderers who have been terrorizing this
camp, so they've started shooting my deputies in the back. I
suppose you'll try to kill me, next. Well, I want to tell you
sneaking rats, whoever you are, that I'm ready for you, any
time."</p>

<p>He fell silent, his rangy frame tense, his eyes burning with
watchful alertness. None moved. The men along the bar might have
been figures cut from stone.</p>

<p>He relaxed and shoved his gun into its scabbard; a sneer twisted
his lips.</p>

<p>"I know your breed. You won't shoot a man unless his back is
toward you. Forty men have been murdered in the vicinity of this
camp within the last year, and not one had a chance to defend
himself.</p>

<p>"Maybe this killing is an ultimatum to me. All right; I've got
an answer ready: I've got a new deputy, and you won't find him so
easy as Grimes. I'm fighting fire with fire from here on. I'm
riding out of the Gulch early in the morning, and when I come back,
I'll have a man with me. A gunfighter from Texas!"</p>

<p>He paused to let this information sink in, and laughed grimly at
the furtive glances that darted from man to man.</p>

<p>"You'll find him no lamb," he predicted vindictively. "He was
too wild for the country where gun-throwing was invented. What he
did down there is none of my business. What he'll do here is what
counts. And all I ask is that the men who murdered Grimes here, try
that same trick on this Texan.</p>

<p>"Another thing, on my own account. I'm meeting this man at
Ogalala Spring tomorrow morning. I'll be riding out alone, at dawn.
If anybody wants to try to waylay me, let him make his plans now!
I'll follow the open trail, and anyone who has any business with me
will find me ready."</p>

<p>And turning his trimly-tailored back scornfully on the throng at
the bar, the sheriff of Wahpeton strode from the saloon.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Ten miles east of Wahpeton a man squatted on his heels, frying
strips of deer meat over a tiny fire. The sun was just coming up. A
short distance away a rangy mustang nibbled at the wiry grass that
grew sparsely between broken rocks. The man had camped there that
night, but his saddle and blanket were hidden back in the bushes.
That fact showed him to be a man of wary nature. No one following
the trail that led past Ogalala Spring could have seen him as he
slept among the bushes. Now, in full daylight, he was making no
attempt to conceal his presence.</p>

<p>The man was tall, broad-shouldered, deep-chested, lean-hipped,
like one who had spent his life in the saddle. His unruly black
hair matched a face burned dark by the sun, but his eyes were a
burning blue. Low on either hip the black butt of a heavy Colt
jutted from a worn black leather scabbard. These guns seemed as
much part of the man as his eyes or his hands. He had worn them so
constantly and so long that their association was as natural as the
use of his limbs.</p>

<p>As he fried his meat and watched his coffee boiling in a
battered old pot, his gaze darted continually eastward where the
trail crossed a wide open space before it vanished among the
thickets of a broken hill country. Westward the trail mounted a
gentle slope and quickly disappeared among trees and bushes that
crowded up within a few yards of the spring. But it was always
eastward that the man looked.</p>

<p>When a rider emerged from the thickets to the east, the man at
the spring set aside the skillet with its sizzling meat strips, and
picked up his rifle &mdash;a long range Sharps .50. His eyes
narrowed with satisfaction. He did not rise, but remained on one
knee, the rifle resting negligently in his hands, the muzzle tilted
upward, not aimed.</p>

<p>The rider came straight on, and the man at the spring watched
him from under the brim of his hat. Only when the stranger pulled
up a few yards away did the first man lift his head and give the
other a full view of his face.</p>

<p>The horseman was a supple youth of medium height, and his hat
did not conceal the fact that his hair was yellow and curly. His
wide eyes were ingenuous, and an infectious smile curved his lips.
There was no rifle under his knee, but an ivory-butted .45 hung low
at his right hip.</p>

<p>His expression as he saw the other man's face gave no hint to
his reaction, except for a slight, momentary contraction of the
muscles that control the eyes&mdash;a movement involuntary and all
but uncontrollable. Then he grinned broadly, and hailed:</p>

<p>"That meat smells prime, stranger!"</p>

<p>"Light and help me with it," invited the other instantly.
"Coffee, too, if you don't mind drinkin' out of the pot."</p>

<p>He laid aside the rifle as the other swung from his saddle. The
blond youngster threw his reins over the horse's head, fumbled in
his blanket roll and drew out a battered tin cup. Holding this in
his right hand he approached the fire with the rolling gait of a
man born to a horse.</p>

<p>"I ain't et my breakfast," he admitted. "Camped down the trail a
piece last night, and come on up here early to meet a man. Thought
you was the <i>hombre</i> till you looked up. Kinda startled me,"
he added frankly. He sat down opposite the taller man, who shoved
the skillet and coffee pot toward him. The tall man moved both
these utensils with his left hand. His right rested lightly and
apparently casually on his right thigh.</p>

<p>The youth filled his tin cup, drank the black, unsweetened
coffee with evident enjoyment, and filled the cup again. He picked
out pieces of the cooling meat with his fingers&mdash;and he was
careful to use only his left hand for that part of the breakfast
that would leave grease on his fingers. But he used his right hand
for pouring coffee and holding the cup to his lips. He did not seem
to notice the position of the other's right hand.</p>

<p>"Name's Glanton," he confided. "Billy Glanton. Texas. Guadalupe
country. Went up the trail with a herd of mossy horns, went broke
buckin' faro in Hayes City, and headed west lookin' for gold. Hell
of a prospector I turned out to be! Now I'm lookin' for a job, and
the man I was goin' to meet here said he had one for me. If I read
your marks right you're a Texan, too?"</p>

<p>The last sentence was more a statement than a question.</p>

<p>"That's my brand," grunted the other. "Name's O'Donnell. Pecos
River country, originally."</p>

<p>His statement, like that of Glanton's, was indefinite. Both the
Pecos and the Guadalupe cover considerable areas of territory. But
Glanton grinned boyishly and stuck out his hand.</p>

<p>"Shake!" he cried. "I'm glad to meet an <i>hombre</i> from my
home state, even if our stampin' grounds down there are a right
smart piece apart!"</p>

<p>Their hands met and locked briefly&mdash;brown, sinewy hands
that had never worn gloves, and that gripped with the abrupt
tension of steel springs.</p>

<p>The handshake seemed to relax O'Donnell. When he poured out
another cup of coffee he held the cup in one hand and the pot in
the other, instead of setting the cup on the ground beside him and
pouring with his left hand.</p>

<p>"I've been in California," he volunteered. "Drifted back on this
side of the mountains a month ago. Been in Wahpeton for the last
few weeks, but gold huntin' ain't my style. I'm a <i>vaquero</i>.
Never should have tried to be anything else. I'm headin' back for
Texas."</p>

<p>"Why don't you try Kansas?" asked Glanton. "It's fillin' up with
Texas men, bringin' cattle up the trail to stock the ranges. Within
a year they'll be drivin' 'em into Wyoming and Montana."</p>

<p>"Maybe I might." O'Donnell lifted the coffee cup absently. He
held it in his left hand, and his right lay in his lap, almost
touching the big black pistol butt. But the tension was gone out of
his frame. He seemed relaxed, absorbed in what Glanton was saying.
The use of his left hand and the position of his right seemed
mechanical, merely an unconscious habit.</p>

<p>"It's a great country," declared Glanton, lowering his head to
conceal the momentary and uncontrollable flicker of triumph in his
eyes. "Fine ranges. Towns springin' up wherever the railroad
touches.</p>

<p>"Everybody gettin' rich on Texas beef. Talkin' about 'cattle
kings'! Wish I could have knowed this beef boom was comin' when I
was a kid! I'd have rounded up about fifty thousand of them
maverick steers that was roamin' loose all over lower Texas, and
put me a brand on 'em, and saved 'em for the market!" He laughed at
his own conceit.</p>

<p>"They wasn't worth six bits a head then," he added, as men in
making small talk will state a fact well known to everyone. "Now
twenty dollars a head ain't the top price."</p>

<p>He emptied his cup and set it on the ground near his right hip.
His easy flow of speech flowed on&mdash;but the natural movement of
his hand away from the cup turned into a blur of speed that flicked
the heavy gun from its scabbard.</p>

<p>Two shots roared like one long stuttering detonation.</p>

<p>The blond newcomer slumped sidewise, his smoking gun falling
from his fingers, a widening spot of crimson suddenly dyeing his
shirt, his wide eyes fixed in sardonic self-mockery on the gun in
O'Donnell's right hand.</p>

<p>"Corcoran!" he muttered. "I thought I had you fooled&mdash;
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Self-mocking laughter bubbled to his lips, cynical to the last;
he was laughing as he died.</p>

<p>The man whose real name was Corcoran rose and looked down at his
victim unemotionally. There was a hole in the side of his shirt,
and a seared spot on the skin of his ribs burned like fire. Even
with his aim spoiled by ripping lead, Glanton's bullet had passed
close.</p>

<p>Reloading the empty chamber of his Colt, Corcoran started toward
the horse the dead man had ridden up to the spring. He had taken
but one step when a sound brought him around, the heavy Colt
jumping back into his hand.</p>

<p>He scowled at the man who stood before him: a tall man, trimly
built, and clad in frontier elegance.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot," this man said imperturbably. "I'm John Middleton,
sheriff of Wahpeton Gulch."</p>

<p>The warning attitude of the other did not relax.</p>

<p>"This was a private matter," he said.</p>

<p>"I guessed as much. Anyway, it's none of my business. I saw two
men at the spring as I rode over a rise in the trail some distance
back. I was only expecting one. I can't afford to take any chance.
I left my horse a short distance back and came on afoot. I was
watching from the bushes and saw the whole thing. He reached for
his gun first, but you already had your hand almost on your gun.
Your shot was first by a flicker. He fooled me. His move came as an
absolute surprise to me."</p>

<p>"He thought it would to me," said Corcoran. "Billy Glanton
always wanted the drop on his man. He always tried to get some
advantage before he pulled his gun.</p>

<p>"He knew me as soon as he saw me; knew that I knew him. But he
thought he was making me think that he didn't know me. I made him
think that. He could take chances because he knew I wouldn't shoot
him down without warnin'&mdash; which is just what he figured on
doin' to me. Finally he thought he had me off my guard, and went
for his gun. I was foolin' him all along."</p>

<p>Middleton looked at Corcoran with much interest. He was familiar
with the two opposite breeds of gunmen. One kind was like Glanton;
utterly cynical, courageous enough when courage was necessary, but
always preferring to gain an advantage by treachery whenever
possible. Corcoran typified the opposite breed; men too direct by
nature, or too proud of their skill to resort to trickery when it
was possible to meet their enemies in the open and rely on sheer
speed and nerve and accuracy. But that Corcoran was a strategist
was proved by his tricking Glanton into drawing.</p>

<p>Middleton looked down at Glanton; in death the yellow curls and
boyish features gave the youthful gunman an appearance of
innocence. But Middleton knew that that mask had covered the heart
of a merciless grey wolf.</p>

<p>"A bad man!" he muttered, staring at the rows of niches on the
ivory stock of Glanton's Colt.</p>

<p>"Plenty bad," agreed Corcoran. "My folks and his had a feud
between 'em down in Texas. He came back from Kansas and killed an
uncle of mine&mdash; shot him down in cold blood. I was in
California when it happened. Got a letter a year after the feud was
over. I was headin' for Kansas, where I figured he'd gone back to,
when I met a man who told me he was in this part of the country,
and was ridin' towards Wahpeton. I cut his trail and camped here
last night waitin' for him.</p>

<p>"It'd been years since we'd seen each other, but he knew
me&mdash;didn't know I knew he knew me, though. That gave me the
edge. You're the man he was goin' to meet here?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I need a gunfighting deputy bad. I'd heard of him. Sent
him word."</p>

<p>Middleton's gaze wandered over Corcoran's hard frame, lingering
on the guns at his hips.</p>

<p>"You pack two irons," remarked the sheriff. "I know what you can
do with your right. But what about the left? I've seen plenty of
men who wore two guns, but those who could use both I can count on
my fingers."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well," smiled the sheriff, "I thought maybe you'd like to show
what you can do with your left."</p>

<p>"Why do you think it makes any difference to me whether you
believe I can handle both guns or not?" retorted Corcoran without
heat.</p>

<p>Middleton seemed to like the reply.</p>

<p>"A tinhorn would be anxious to make me believe he could. You
don't have to prove anything to me. I've seen enough to show me
that you're the man I need. Corcoran, I came out here to hire
Glanton as my deputy. I'll make the same proposition to you. What
you were down in Texas, or out in California, makes no difference
to me. I know your breed, and I know that you'll shoot square with
a man who trusts you, regardless of what you may have been in other
parts, or will be again, somewhere else.</p>

<p>"I'm up against a situation in Wahpeton that I can't cope with
alone, or with the forces I have.</p>

<p>"For a year the town and the camps up and down the gulch have
been terrorized by a gang of outlaws who call themselves the
Vultures.</p>

<p>"That describes them perfectly. No man's life or property is
safe. Forty or fifty men have been murdered, hundreds robbed. It's
next to impossible for a man to pack out any dust, or for a big
shipment of gold to get through on the stage. So many men have been
shot trying to protect shipments that the stage company has trouble
hiring guards any more.</p>

<p>"Nobody knows who are the leaders of the gang. There are a
number of ruffians who are suspected of being members of the
Vultures, but we have no proof that would stand up, even in a
miners' court. Nobody dares give evidence against any of them. When
a man recognizes the men who rob him he doesn't dare reveal his
knowledge. I can't get anyone to identify a criminal, though I know
that robbers and murderers are walking the streets, and rubbing
elbows with me along the bars. It's maddening! And yet I can't
blame the poor devils. Any man who dared testify against one of
them would be murdered.</p>

<p>"People blame me some, but I can't give adequate protection to
the camp with the resources allowed me. You know how a gold camp
is; everybody so greedy-blind they don't want to do anything but
grab for the yellow dust. My deputies are brave men, but they can't
be everywhere, and they're not gunfighters. If I arrest a man there
are a dozen to stand up in a miners' court and swear enough lies to
acquit him. Only last night they murdered one of my deputies, Jim
Grimes, in cold blood.</p>

<p>"I sent for Billy Glanton when I heard he was in this country,
because I need a man of more than usual skill. I need a man who can
handle a gun like a streak of forked lightning, and knows all the
tricks of trapping and killing a man. I'm tired of arresting
criminals to be turned loose! Wild Bill Hickok has the right
idea&mdash;kill the badmen and save the jails for the petty
offenders!"</p>

<p>The Texan scowled slightly at the mention of Hickok, who was not
loved by the riders who came up the cattle trails, but he nodded
agreement with the sentiment expressed. The fact that he, himself,
would fall into Hickok's category of those to be exterminated did
not prejudice his viewpoint.</p>

<p>"You're a better man than Glanton," said Middleton abruptly.
"The proof is that Glanton lies there dead, and here you stand very
much alive. I'll offer you the same terms I meant to offer
him."</p>

<p>He named a monthly salary considerably larger than that drawn by
the average Eastern city marshal. Gold was the most plentiful
commodity in Wahpeton.</p>

<p>"And a monthly bonus," added Middleton. "When I hire talent I
expect to pay for it; so do the merchants and miners who look to me
for protection."</p>

<p>Corcoran meditated a moment.</p>

<p>"No use in me goin' on to Kansas now," he said finally. "None of
my folks in Texas are havin' any feud that I know of. I'd like to
see this Wahpeton. I'll take you up."</p>

<p>"Good!" Middleton extended his hand and as Corcoran took it he
noticed that it was much browner than the left. No glove had
covered that hand for many years.</p>

<p>"Let's get it started right away! But first we'll have to
dispose of Glanton's body."</p>

<p>"I'll take along his gun and horse and send 'em to Texas to his
folks," said Corcoran.</p>

<p>"But the body?"</p>

<p>"Hell, the buzzards'll 'tend to it."</p>

<p>"No, no!" protested Middleton. "Let's cover it with bushes and
rocks, at least."</p>

<p>Corcoran shrugged his shoulders. It was not vindictiveness which
prompted his seeming callousness. His hatred of the blond youth did
not extend to the lifeless body of the man. It was simply that he
saw no use in going to what seemed to him an unnecessary task. He
had hated Glanton with the merciless hate of his race, which is
more enduring and more relentless than the hate of an Indian or a
Spaniard. But toward the body that was no longer animated by the
personality he had hated, he was simply indifferent. He expected
some day to leave his own corpse stretched on the ground, and the
thought of buzzards tearing at his dead flesh moved him no more
than the sight of his dead enemy. His creed was pagan and nakedly
elemental.</p>

<p>A man's body, once life had left it, was no more than any other
carcass, moldering back into the soil which once produced it.</p>

<p>But he helped Middleton drag the body into an opening among the
bushes, and build a rude cairn above it. And he waited patiently
while Middleton carved the dead youth's name on a rude cross
fashioned from broken branches, and thrust upright among the
stones.</p>

<p>Then they rode for Wahpeton, Corcoran leading the riderless
roan; over the horn of the empty saddle hung the belt supporting
the dead man's gun, the ivory stock of which bore eleven notches,
each of which represented a man's life.</p>

<h2><a id="vultures2" name="vultures2">II. &mdash; GOLDEN
MADNESS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE mining town of Wahpeton sprawled in a wide
gulch that wandered between sheer rock walls and steep hillsides.
Cabins, saloons and dance-halls backed against the cliffs on the
south side of the gulch. The houses facing them were almost on the
bank of Wahpeton Creek, which wandered down the gulch, keeping
mostly to the center. On both sides of the creek cabins and tents
straggled for a mile and a half each way from the main body of the
town. Men were washing gold dust out of the creek, and out of its
smaller tributaries which meandered into the canyon along tortuous
ravines. Some of these ravines opened into the gulch between the
houses built against the wall, and the cabins and tents which
straggled up them gave the impression that the town had overflowed
the main gulch and spilled into its tributaries.</p>

<p>Buildings were of logs, or of bare planks laboriously freighted
over the mountains. Squalor and draggled or gaudy elegance rubbed
elbows. An intense virility surged through the scene. What other
qualities it might have lacked, it overflowed with a superabundance
of vitality. Color, action, movement &mdash;growth and power! The
atmosphere was alive with these elements, stinging and tingling.
Here there were no delicate shadings or subtle contrasts. Life
painted here in broad, raw colors, in bold, vivid strokes. Men who
came here left behind them the delicate nuances, the cultured
tranquilities of life. An empire was being built on muscle and guts
and audacity, and men dreamed gigantically and wrought
terrifically. No dream was too mad, no enterprise too tremendous to
be accomplished.</p>

<p>Passions ran raw and turbulent. Boot heels stamped on bare plank
floors, in the eddying dust of the street. Voices boomed, tempers
exploded in sudden outbursts of primitive violence. Shrill voices
of painted harpies mingled with the clank of gold on gambling
tables, gusty mirth and vociferous altercation along the bars where
raw liquor hissed in a steady stream down hairy, dust-caked
throats. It was one of a thousand similar panoramas of the day,
when a giant empire was bellowing in lusty infancy.</p>

<p>But a sinister undercurrent was apparent. Corcoran, riding by
the sheriff, was aware of this, his senses and intuitions whetted
to razor keenness by the life he led. The instincts of a gunfighter
were developed to an abnormal alertness, else he had never lived
out his first year of gunmanship. But it took no abnormally
developed instinct to tell Corcoran that hidden currents ran here,
darkly and strongly.</p>

<p>As they threaded their way among trains of pack-mules, rumbling
wagons and swarms of men on foot which thronged the straggling
street, Corcoran was aware of many eyes following them. Talk ceased
suddenly among gesticulating groups as they recognized the sheriff,
then the eyes swung to Corcoran, searching and appraising. He did
not seem to be aware of their scrutiny.</p>

<p>Middleton murmured: "They know I'm bringing back a gunfighting
deputy. Some of those fellows are Vultures, though I can't prove
it. Look out for yourself."</p>

<p>Corcoran considered this advice too unnecessary to merit a
reply. They were riding past the <i>King of Diamonds</i> gambling
hall at the moment, and a group of men clustered in the doorway
turned to stare at them. One lifted a hand in greeting to the
sheriff.</p>

<p>"Ace Brent, the biggest gambler in the gulch," murmured
Middleton as he returned the salute. Corcoran got a glimpse of a
slim figure in elegant broadcloth, a keen, inscrutable countenance,
and a pair of piercing black eyes.</p>

<p>Middleton did not enlarge upon his description of the man, but
rode on in silence.</p>

<p>They traversed the body of the town&mdash;the clusters of stores
and saloons&mdash;and passed on, halting at a cabin apart from the
rest. Between it and the town the creek swung out in a wide loop
that carried it some distance from the south wall of the gulch, and
the cabins and tents straggled after the creek. That left this
particular cabin isolated, for it was built with its back wall
squarely against the sheer cliff. There was a corral on one side, a
clump of trees on the other. Beyond the trees a narrow ravine
opened into the gulch, dry and unoccupied.</p>

<p>"This is my cabin," said Middleton. "That cabin back
there"&mdash;he pointed to one which they had passed, a few hundred
yards back up the road &mdash;"I use for a sheriff's office. I need
only one room. You can bunk in the back room. You can keep your
horse in my corral, if you want to. I always keep several there for
my deputies. It pays to have a fresh supply of horseflesh always on
hand."</p>

<p>As Corcoran dismounted he glanced back at the cabin he was to
occupy. It stood close to a clump of trees, perhaps a hundred yards
from the steep wall of the gulch.</p>

<p>There were four men at the sheriff's cabin, one of which
Middleton introduced to Corcoran as Colonel Hopkins, formerly of
Tennessee. He was a tall, portly man with an iron grey mustache and
goatee, as well dressed as Middleton himself.</p>

<p>"Colonel Hopkins owns the rich Elinor A. claim, in partnership
with Dick Bisley," said Middleton; "in addition to being one of the
most prominent merchants in the Gulch."</p>

<p>"A great deal of good either occupation does me, when I can't
get my money out of town," retorted the colonel. "Three times my
partner and I have lost big shipments of gold on the stage. Once we
sent out a load concealed in wagons loaded with supplies supposed
to be intended for the miners at Teton Gulch. Once clear of
Wahpeton the drivers were to swing back east through the mountains.
But somehow the Vultures learned of our plan; they caught the
wagons fifteen miles south of Wahpeton, looted them and murdered
the guards and drivers."</p>

<p>"The town's honeycombed with their spies," muttered
Middleton.</p>

<p>"Of course. One doesn't know who to trust. It was being
whispered in the streets that my men had been killed and robbed,
before their bodies had been found. We know that the Vultures knew
all about our plan, that they rode straight out from Wahpeton,
committed that crime and rode straight back with the gold dust. But
we could do nothing. We can't prove anything, or convict
anybody."</p>

<p>Middleton introduced Corcoran to the three deputies, Bill McNab,
Richardson, and Stark. McNab was as tall as Corcoran and more
heavily built, hairy and muscular, with restless eyes that
reflected a violent temper. Richardson was more slender, with cold,
unblinking eyes, and Corcoran instantly classified him as the most
dangerous of the three. Stark was a burly, bearded fellow, not
differing in type from hundreds of miners. Corcoran found the
appearances of these men incongruous with their protestations of
helplessness in the face of the odds against them. They looked like
hard men, well able to take care of themselves in any
situation.</p>

<p>Middleton, as if sensing his thoughts, said: "These men are not
afraid of the devil, and they can throw a gun as quick as the
average man, or quicker. But it's hard for a stranger to appreciate
just what we're up against here in Wahpeton. If it was a matter of
an open fight, it would be different. I wouldn't need any more
help. But it's blind going, working in the dark, not knowing who to
trust. I don't dare to deputize a man unless I'm sure of his
honesty. And who can be sure of who? We know the town is full of
spies. We don't know who they are; we don't know who the leader of
the Vultures is."</p>

<p>Hopkins' bearded chin jutted stubbornly as he said: "I still
believe that gambler, Ace Brent, is mixed up with the gang.
Gamblers have been murdered and robbed, but Brent's never been
molested. What becomes of all the dust he wins? Many of the miners,
despairing of ever getting out of the gulch with their gold, blow
it all in the saloons and gambling halls. Brent's won thousands of
dollars in dust and nuggets. So have several others. What becomes
of it? It doesn't all go back into circulation. I believe they get
it out, over the mountains. And if they do, when no one else can,
that proves to my mind that they're members of the Vultures."</p>

<p>"Maybe they cache it, like you and the other merchants are
doing," suggested Middleton. "I don't know. Brent's intelligent
enough to be the chief of the Vultures. But I've never been able to
get anything on him."</p>

<p>"You've never been able to get anything definite on anybody,
except petty offenders," said Colonel Hopkins bluntly, as he took
up his hat. "No offense intended, John. We know what you're up
against, and we can't blame you. But it looks like, for the good of
the camp, we're going to have to take direct action."</p>

<p>Middleton stared after the broadcloth-clad back as it receded
from the cabin.</p>

<p>"'We,'" he murmured. "That means the vigilantes&mdash;or rather
the men who have been agitating a vigilante movement. I can
understand their feelings, but I consider it an unwise move. In the
first place, such an organization is itself outside the law, and
would be playing into the hands of the lawless element. Then,
what's to prevent outlaws from joining the vigilantes, and
diverting it to suit their own ends?"</p>

<p>"Not a damned thing!" broke in McNab heatedly. "Colonel Hopkins
and his friends are hot-headed. They expect too much from us. Hell,
we're just ordinary workin' men. We do the best we can, but we
ain't gunslingers like this man Corcoran here."</p>

<p>Corcoran found himself mentally questioning the whole truth of
this statement; Richardson had all the earmarks of a gunman, if he
had ever seen one, and the Texan's experience in such matters
ranged from the Pacific to the Gulf.</p>

<p>Middleton picked up his hat. "You boys scatter out through the
camp. I'm going to take Corcoran around, when I've sworn him in and
given him his badge, and introduce him to the leading men of the
camp.</p>

<p>"I don't want any mistake, or any chance of mistake, about his
standing. I've put you in a tight spot, Corcoran, I'll
admit&mdash;boasting about the gunfighting deputy I was going to
get. But I'm confident that you can take care of yourself."</p>

<p>The eyes that had followed their ride down the street focused on
the sheriff and his companion as they made their way on foot along
the straggling street with its teeming saloons and gambling halls.
Gamblers and bartenders were swamped with business, and merchants
were getting rich with all commodities selling at unheard-of
prices. Wages for day-labor matched prices for groceries, for few
men could be found to toil for a prosaic, set salary when their
eyes were dazzled by visions of creeks fat with yellow dust and
gorges crammed with nuggets. Some of those dreams were not
disappointed; millions of dollars in virgin gold was being taken
out of the claims up and down the gulch. But the finders frequently
found it a golden weight hung to their necks to drag them down to a
bloody death. Unseen, unknown, on furtive feet the human wolves
stole among them, unerringly marking their prey and striking in the
dark.</p>

<p>From saloon to saloon, dance hall to dance hall, where weary
girls in tawdry finery allowed themselves to be tussled and hauled
about by bear-like males who emptied sacks of gold dust down the
low necks of their dresses, Middleton piloted Corcoran, talking
rapidly and incessantly. He pointed out men in the crowd and gave
their names and status in the community, and introduced the Texan
to the more important citizens of the camp.</p>

<p>All eyes followed Corcoran curiously. The day was still in the
future when the northern ranges would be flooded by Texas cattle,
driven by wiry Texas riders; but Texans were not unknown, even
then, in the mining camps of the Northwest. In the first days of
the gold rushes they had drifted in from the camps of California,
to which, at a still earlier date, the Southwest had sent some of
her staunchest and some of her most turbulent sons. And of late
others had drifted in from the Kansas cattle towns along whose
streets the lean riders were swaggering and fighting out feuds
brought up from the far south country. Many in Wahpeton were
familiar with the characteristics of the Texas breed, and all had
heard tales of the fighting men bred among the live oaks and
mesquites of that hot, turbulent country where racial traits met
and clashed, and the traditions of the Old South mingled with those
of the untamed West.</p>

<p>Here, then, was a lean grey wolf from that southern pack; some
of the men looked their scowling animosity; but most merely looked,
in the role of spectators, eager to witness the drama all felt
imminent.</p>

<p>"You're, primarily, to fight the Vultures, of course," Middleton
told Corcoran as they walked together down the street. "But that
doesn't mean you're to overlook petty offenders. A lot of
small-time crooks and bullies are so emboldened by the success of
the big robbers that they think they can get away with things, too.
If you see a man shooting up a saloon, take his gun away and throw
him into jail to sober up. That's the jail, up yonder at the other
end of town. Don't let men fight on the street or in saloons.
Innocent bystanders get hurt."</p>

<p>"All right." Corcoran saw no harm in shooting up saloons or
fighting in public places. In Texas few innocent bystanders were
ever hurt, for there men sent their bullets straight to the mark
intended. But he was ready to follow instructions.</p>

<p>"So much for the smaller fry. You know what to do with the
really bad men. We're not bringing any more murderers into court to
be acquitted through their friends' lies!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="vultures3" name="vultures3">III. &mdash; GUNMAN'S
TRAP</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">NIGHT had fallen over the roaring madness that was
Wahpeton Gulch. Light streamed from the open doors of saloons and
honky-tonks, and the gusts of noise that rushed out into the street
smote the passers-by like the impact of a physical blow.</p>

<p>Corcoran traversed the street with the smooth, easy stride of
perfectly poised muscles. He seemed to be looking straight ahead,
but his eyes missed nothing on either side of him. As he passed
each building in turn he analyzed the sounds that issued from the
open door, and knew just how much was rough merriment and
horseplay, recognized the elements of anger and menace when they
edged some of the voices, and accurately appraised the extent and
intensity of those emotions. A real gunfighter was not merely a man
whose eye was truer, whose muscles were quicker than other men; he
was a practical psychologist, a student of human nature, whose life
depended on the correctness of his conclusions.</p>

<p>It was the Golden Garter dance hall that gave him his first job
as a defender of law and order.</p>

<p>As he passed a startling clamor burst forth
inside&mdash;strident feminine shrieks piercing a din of coarse
masculine hilarity. Instantly he was through the door and elbowing
a way through the crowd which was clustered about the center of the
room. Men cursed and turned belligerently as they felt his elbows
in their ribs, twisted their heads to threaten him, and then gave
back as they recognized the new deputy.</p>

<p>Corcoran broke through into the open space the crowd ringed, and
saw two women fighting like furies. One, a tall, fine blond girl,
had bent a shrieking, biting, clawing Mexican girl back over a
billiard table, and the crowd was yelling joyful encouragement to
one or the other: "Give it to her, Glory!" "Slug her, gal!" "Hell,
Conchita, bite her!"</p>

<p>The brown girl heeded this last bit of advice and followed it so
energetically that Glory cried out sharply and jerked away her
wrist, which dripped blood. In the grip of the hysterical frenzy
which seizes women in such moments, she caught up a billiard ball
and lifted it to crash it down on the head of her screaming
captive.</p>

<p>Corcoran caught that uplifted wrist, and deftly flicked the
ivory sphere from her fingers. Instantly she whirled on him like a
tigress, her yellow hair falling in disorder over her shoulders,
bared by the violence of the struggle, her eyes blazing. She lifted
her hands toward his face, her fingers working spasmodically, at
which some drunk bawled, with a shout of laughter: "Scratch his
eyes out, Glory!"</p>

<p>Corcoran made no move to defend his features; he did not seem to
see the white fingers twitching so near his face. He was staring
into her furious face, and the candid admiration of his gaze seemed
to confuse her, even in her anger. She dropped her hands but fell
back on woman's traditional weapon&mdash;her tongue.</p>

<p>"You're Middleton's new deputy! I might have expected you to
butt in! Where are McNab and the rest? Drunk in some gutter? Is
this the way you catch murderers? You lawmen are all
alike&mdash;better at bullying girls than at catching outlaws!"</p>

<p>Corcoran stepped past her and picked up the hysterical Mexican
girl. Conchita, seeing that she was more frightened than hurt,
scurried toward the back rooms, sobbing in rage and humiliation,
and clutching about her the shreds of garments her enemy's tigerish
attack had left her.</p>

<p>Corcoran looked again at Glory, who stood clenching and
unclenching her white fists. She was still fermenting with anger,
and furious at his intervention. No one in the crowd about them
spoke; no one laughed, but all seemed to hold their breaths as she
launched into another tirade. They knew Corcoran was a dangerous
man, but they did not know the code by which he had been reared;
did not know that Glory, or any other woman, was safe from violence
at his hands, whatever her offense.</p>

<p>"Why don't you call McNab?" she sneered. "Judging from the way
Middleton's deputies have been working, it will probably take three
or four of you to drag one helpless girl to jail!"</p>

<p>"Who said anything about takin' you to jail?" Corcoran's gaze
dwelt in fascination on her ruddy cheeks, the crimson of her full
lips in startling contrast against the whiteness of her teeth. She
shook her yellow hair back impatiently, as a spirited young animal
might shake back its flowing mane.</p>

<p>"You're not arresting me?" She seemed startled, thrown into
confusion by this unexpected statement.</p>

<p>"No. I just kept you from killin' that girl. If you'd brained
her with that billiard ball I'd have had to arrest you."</p>

<p>"She lied about me!" Her wide eyes flashed, and her breast
heaved again.</p>

<p>"That wasn't no excuse for makin' a public show of yourself," he
answered without heat. "If ladies have got to fight, they ought to
do it in private."</p>

<p>And so saying he turned away. A gusty exhalation of breath
seemed to escape the crowd, and the tension vanished, as they
turned to the bar. The incident was forgotten, merely a trifling
episode in an existence crowded with violent incidents. Jovial
masculine voices mingled with the shriller laughter of women, as
glasses began to clink along the bar.</p>

<p>Glory hesitated, drawing her torn dress together over her bosom,
then darted after Corcoran, who was moving toward the door. When
she touched his arm he whipped about as quick as a cat, a hand
flashing to a gun. She glimpsed a momentary gleam in his eyes as
menacing and predatory as the threat that leaps in a panther's
eyes. Then it was gone as he saw whose hand had touched him.</p>

<p>"She lied about me," Glory said, as if defending herself from a
charge of misconduct. "She's a dirty little cat."</p>

<p>Corcoran looked her over from head to foot, as if he had not
heard her; his blue eyes burned her like a physical fire.</p>

<p>She stammered in confusion. Direct and unveiled admiration was
commonplace, but there was an elemental candor about the Texan such
as she had never before encountered.</p>

<p>He broke in on her stammerings in a way that showed he had paid
no attention to what she was saying.</p>

<p>"Let me buy you a drink. There's a table over there where we can
sit down."</p>

<p>"No. I must go and put on another dress. I just wanted to say
that I'm glad you kept me from killing Conchita. She's a slut, but
I don't want her blood on my hands."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>She found it hard to make conversation with him, and could not
have said why she wished to make conversation.</p>

<p>"McNab arrested me once," she said, irrelevantly, her eyes
dilating as if at the memory of an injustice. "I slapped him for
something he said. He was going to put me in jail for resisting an
officer of the law! Middleton made him turn me loose."</p>

<p>"McNab must be a fool," said Corcoran slowly.</p>

<p>"He's mean; he's got a nasty temper, and he&mdash;what's
that?"</p>

<p>Down the street sounded a fusillade of shots, a blurry voice
yelling gleefully.</p>

<p>"Some fool shooting up a saloon," she murmured, and darted a
strange glance at her companion, as if a drunk shooting into the
air was an unusual occurrence in that wild mining camp.</p>

<p>"Middleton said that's against the law," he grunted, turning
away.</p>

<p>"Wait!" she cried sharply, catching at him. But he was already
moving through the door, and Glory stopped short as a hand fell
lightly on her shoulder from behind. Turning her head she paled to
see the keenly-chiseled face of Ace Brent. His hand lay gently on
her shoulder, but there was a command and a blood-chilling threat
in its touch. She shivered and stood still as a statue, as
Corcoran, unaware of the drama being played behind him, disappeared
into the street.</p>

<p>The racket was coming from the Blackfoot Chief Saloon, a few
doors down, and on the same side of the street as the Golden
Garter. With a few long strides Corcoran reached the door. But he
did not rush in. He halted and swept his cool gaze deliberately
over the interior. In the center of the saloon a roughly dressed
man was reeling about, whooping and discharging a pistol into the
ceiling, perilously close to the big oil lamp which hung there. The
bar was lined with men, all bearded and uncouthly garbed, so it was
impossible to tell which were ruffians and which were honest
miners. All the men in the room were at the bar, with the exception
of the drunken man.</p>

<p>Corcoran paid little heed to him as he came through the door,
though he moved straight toward him, and to the tense watchers it
seemed the Texan was looking at no one else. In reality, from the
corner of his eye he was watching the men at the bar; and as he
moved deliberately from the door, across the room, he distinguished
the pose of honest curiosity from the tension of intended murder.
He saw the three hands that gripped gun butts.</p>

<p>And as he, apparently ignorant of what was going on at the bar,
stepped toward the man reeling in the center of the room, a gun
jumped from its scabbard and pointed toward the lamp. And even as
it moved, Corcoran moved quicker. His turn was a blur of motion too
quick for the eye to follow and even as he turned his gun was
burning red.</p>

<p>The man who had drawn died on his feet with his gun still
pointed toward the ceiling, unfired. Another stood gaping, stunned,
a pistol dangling in his fingers, for that fleeting tick of time;
then as he woke and whipped the gun up, hot lead ripped through his
brain. A third gun spoke once as the owner fired wildly, and then
he went to his knees under the blast of ripping lead, slumped over
on the floor and lay twitching.</p>

<p>It was over in a flash, action so blurred with speed that not
one of the watchers could ever tell just exactly what had happened.
One instant Corcoran had been moving toward the man in the center
of the room, the next both guns were blazing and three men were
falling from the bar, crashing dead on the floor.</p>

<p>For an instant the scene held, Corcoran half-crouching, guns
held at his hips, facing the men who stood stunned along the bar.
Wisps of blue smoke drifted from the muzzles of his guns, forming a
misty veil through which his grim face looked, implacable and
passionless as that of an image carved from granite. But his eyes
blazed.</p>

<p>Shakily, moving like puppets on a string, the men at the bar
lifted their hands clear of their waistline. Death hung on the
crook of a finger for a shuddering tick of time. Then with a
choking gasp the man who had played drunk made a stumbling rush
toward the door. With a catlike wheel and stroke Corcoran crashed a
gun barrel over his head and stretched him stunned and bleeding on
the floor.</p>

<p>The Texan was facing the men at the bar again before any of them
could have moved. He had not looked at the men on the floor since
they had fallen.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>amigos</i>!" His voice was soft, but it was thick with
killer's lust. "Why don't you-all keep the <i>baile</i> goin'?
Ain't these <i>hombres</i> got no friends?"</p>

<p>Apparently they had not. No one made a move.</p>

<p>Realizing that the crisis had passed, that there was no more
killing to be done just then, Corcoran straightened, shoving his
guns back in his scabbards.</p>

<p>"Purty crude," he criticized. "I don't see how anybody could
fall for a trick that stale. Man plays drunk and starts shootin' at
the roof. Officer comes in to arrest him. When the officer's back's
turned, somebody shoots out the light, and the drunk falls on the
floor to get out of the line of fire. Three or four men planted
along the bar start blazin' away in the dark at the place where
they know the law's standin', and out of eighteen or twenty-four
shots, some's bound to connect."</p>

<p>With a harsh laugh he stooped, grabbed the "drunk" by the collar
and hauled him upright. The man staggered and stared wildly about
him, blood dripping from the gash in his scalp.</p>

<p>"You got to come along to jail," said Corcoran unemotionally.
"Sheriff says it's against the law to shoot up saloons. I ought to
shoot you, but I ain't in the habit of pluggin' men with empty
guns. Reckon you'll be more value to the sheriff alive than dead,
anyway."</p>

<p>And propelling his dizzy charge, he strode out into the street.
A crowd had gathered about the door, and they gave back suddenly.
He saw a supple, feminine figure dart into the circle of light,
which illumined the white face and golden hair of the girl
Glory.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed sharply. "Oh!" Her exclamation was almost
drowned in a sudden clamor of voices as the men in the street
realized what had happened in the Blackfoot Chief.</p>

<p>Corcoran felt her pluck at his sleeve as he passed her, heard
her tense whisper.</p>

<p>"I was afraid&mdash;I tried to warn you&mdash;I'm glad they
didn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>A shadow of a smile touched his hard lips as he glanced down at
her. Then he was gone, striding down the street toward the jail,
half-pushing, half-dragging his bewildered prisoner.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="vultures4" name="vultures4">IV. &mdash; THE MADNESS THAT
BLINDS MEN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">CORCORAN locked the door on the man who seemed
utterly unable to realize just what had happened, and turned away,
heading for the sheriff's office at the other end of town. He
kicked on the door of the jailer's shack, a few yards from the
jail, and roused that individual out of a slumber he believed was
alcoholic, and informed him he had a prisoner in his care. The
jailer seemed as surprised as the victim was.</p>

<p>No one had followed Corcoran to the jail, and the street was
almost deserted, as the people jammed morbidly into the Blackfoot
Chief to stare at the bodies and listen to conflicting stories as
to just what had happened.</p>

<p>Colonel Hopkins came running up, breathlessly, to grab
Corcoran's hand and pump it vigorously.</p>

<p>"By gad, sir, you have the real spirit! Guts! Speed! They tell
me the loafers at the bar didn't even have time to dive for cover
before it was over! I'll admit I'd ceased to expect much of John's
deputies, but you've shown your metal! These fellows were
undoubtedly Vultures. That Tom Deal, you've got in jail, I've
suspected him for some time. We'll question him&mdash;make him tell
us who the rest are, and who their leader is. Come in and have a
drink, sir!"</p>

<p>"Thanks, but not just now. I'm goin' to find Middleton and
report this business. His office ought to be closer to the jail. I
don't think much of his jailer. When I get through reportin' I'm
goin' back and guard that fellow myself."</p>

<p>Hopkins emitted more laudations, and then clapped the Texan on
the back and darted away to take part in whatever informal inquest
was being made, and Corcoran strode on through the emptying street.
The fact that so much uproar was being made over the killing of
three would-be murderers showed him how rare was a successful
resistance to the Vultures. He shrugged his shoulders as he
remembered feuds and range wars in his native Southwest: men
falling like flies under the unerring drive of bullets on the open
range and in the streets of Texas towns. But there all men were
frontiersmen, sons and grandsons of frontiersmen; here, in the
mining camps, the frontier element was only one of several
elements, many drawn from sections where men had forgotten how to
defend themselves through generations of law and order.</p>

<p>He saw a light spring up in the sheriff's cabin just before he
reached it, and, with his mind on possible gunmen lurking in
ambush&mdash;for they must have known he would go directly to the
cabin from the jail&mdash;he swung about and approached the
building by a route that would not take him across the bar of light
pouring from the window. So it was that the man who came running
noisily down the road passed him without seeing the Texan as he
kept in the shadows of the cliff. The man was McNab; Corcoran knew
him by his powerful build, his slouching carriage. And as he burst
through the door, his face was illuminated and Corcoran was amazed
to see it contorted in a grimace of passion.</p>

<p>Voices rose inside the cabin, McNab's bull-like roar, thick with
fury, and the calmer tones of Middleton. Corcoran hurried forward,
and as he approached he heard McNab roar: "Damn you, Middleton,
you've got a lot of explainin' to do! Why didn't you warn the boys
he was a killer?"</p>

<p>At that moment Corcoran stepped into the cabin and demanded:
"What's the trouble, McNab?"</p>

<p>The big deputy whirled with a feline snarl of rage, his eyes
glaring with murderous madness as they recognized Corcoran.</p>

<p>"You damned&mdash;" A string of filthy expletives gushed from
his thick lips as he ripped out his gun. Its muzzle had scarcely
cleared leather when a Colt banged in Corcoran's right hand.
McNab's gun clattered to the floor and he staggered back, grasping
his right arm with his left hand, and cursing like a madman.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, you fool?" demanded Corcoran
harshly. "Shut up! I did you a favor by not killin' you. If you
wasn't a deputy I'd have drilled you through the head. But I will
anyway, if you don't shut your dirty trap."</p>

<p>"You killed Breckman, Red Bill and Curly!" raved McNab; he
looked like a wounded grizzly as he swayed there, blood trickling
down his wrist and dripping off his fingers.</p>

<p>"Was that their names? Well, what about it?"</p>

<p>"Bill's drunk, Corcoran," interposed Middleton. "He goes crazy
when he's full of liquor."</p>

<p>McNab's roar of fury shook the cabin. His eyes turned red and he
swayed on his feet as if about to plunge at Middleton's throat.</p>

<p>"Drunk?" he bellowed. "You lie, Middleton! Damn you, what's your
game? You sent your own men to death! Without warnin'!"</p>

<p>"His own men?" Corcoran's eyes were suddenly glittering slits.
He stepped back and made a half-turn so that he was facing both
men; his hands became claws hovering over his gun-butts.</p>

<p>"Yes, his men!" snarled McNab. "You fool, <i>he's</i> the chief
of the Vultures!"</p>

<p>An electric silence gripped the cabin. Middleton stood rigid,
his empty hands hanging limp, knowing that his life hung on a
thread no more substantial than a filament of morning dew. If he
moved, if, when he spoke, his tone jarred on Corcoran's suspicious
ears, guns would be roaring before a man could snap his
fingers.</p>

<p>"Is that so?" Corcoran shot at him.</p>

<p>"Yes," Middleton said calmly, with no inflection in his voice
that could be taken as a threat. "I'm chief of the Vultures."</p>

<p>Corcoran glared at him puzzled. "What's your game?" he demanded,
his tone thick with the deadly instinct of his breed.</p>

<p>"That's what I want to know!" bawled McNab. "We killed Grimes
for you, because he was catchin' on to things. And we set the same
trap for this devil. He knew! He must have known! You warned
him&mdash;told him all about it!"</p>

<p>"He told me nothin'," grated Corcoran. "He didn't have to.
Nobody but a fool would have been caught in a trap like that.
Middleton, before I blow you to Hell, I want to know one thing:
what good was it goin' to do you to bring me into Wahpeton, and
have me killed the first night I was here?"</p>

<p>"I didn't bring you here for that," answered Middleton.</p>

<p>"Then what'd you bring him here for?" yelled McNab. "You told
us&mdash; "</p>

<p>"I told you I was bringing a new deputy here, that was a
gunslinging fool," broke in Middleton. "That was the truth. That
should have been warning enough."</p>

<p>"But we thought that was just talk, to fool the people,"
protested McNab bewilderedly. He sensed that he was beginning to be
wound in a web he could not break.</p>

<p>"Did I tell you it was just talk?"</p>

<p>"No, but we thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I gave you no reason to think anything. The night when Grimes
was killed I told everyone in the Golden Eagle that I was bringing
in a Texas gunfighter as my deputy. I spoke the truth."</p>

<p>"But you wanted him killed, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't. I didn't say a word about having him killed."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did I?" Middleton pursued relentlessly. "Did I give you a
definite order to kill Corcoran, to molest him in any way?"</p>

<p>Corcoran's eyes were molten steel, burning into McNab's soul.
The befuddled giant scowled and floundered, vaguely realizing that
he was being put in the wrong, but not understanding how, or
why.</p>

<p>"No, you didn't tell us to kill him in so many words; but you
didn't tell us to let him alone."</p>

<p>"Do I have to tell you to let people alone to keep you from
killing them? There are about three thousand people in this camp
I've never given any definite orders about. Are you going out and
kill them, and say you thought I meant you to do it, because I
didn't tell you not to?"</p>

<p>"Well, I&mdash;" McNab began apologetically, then burst out in
righteous though bewildered wrath: "Damn it, it was the
understandin' that we'd get rid of deputies like that, who wasn't
on the inside. We thought you were bringin' in an honest deputy to
fool the folks, just like you hired Jim Grimes to fool 'em. We
thought you was just makin' a talk to the fools in the Golden
Eagle. We thought you'd want him out of the way as quick as
possible&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You drew your own conclusions and acted without my orders,"
snapped Middleton. "That's all that it amounts to. Naturally
Corcoran defended himself. If I'd had any idea that you fools would
try to murder him, I'd have passed the word to let him alone. I
thought you understood my motives. I brought Corcoran in here to
fool the people; yes. But he's not a man like Jim Grimes. Corcoran
is with us. He'll clean out the thieves that are working outside
our gang, and we'll accomplish two things with one stroke: get rid
of competition and make the miners think we're on the level."</p>

<p>McNab stood glaring at Middleton; three times he opened his
mouth, and each time he shut it without speaking. He knew that an
injustice had been done him; that a responsibility that was not
rightfully his had been dumped on his brawny shoulders. But the
subtle play of Middleton's wits was beyond him; he did not know how
to defend himself or make a countercharge.</p>

<p>"All right," he snarled. "We'll forget it. But the boys ain't
goin' to forget how Corcoran shot down their pards. I'll talk to
'em, though. Tom Deal's got to be out of that jail before daylight.
Hopkins is aimin' to question him about the gang. I'll stage a fake
jailbreak for him. But first I've got to get this arm dressed." And
he slouched out of the cabin and away through the darkness, a
baffled giant, burning with murderous rage, but too tangled in a
net of subtlety to know where or how or who to smite.</p>

<p>Back in the cabin Middleton faced Corcoran who still stood with
his thumbs hooked in his belt, his fingers near his gun butts. A
whimsical smile played on Middleton's thin lips, and Corcoran
smiled back; but it was the mirthless grin of a crouching
panther.</p>

<p>"You can't tangle me up with words like you did that big ox,"
Corcoran said. "You let me walk into that trap. You knew your men
were ribbin' it up. You let 'em go ahead, when a word from you
would have stopped it. You knew they'd think you wanted me killed,
like Grimes, if you didn't say nothin'. You let 'em think that, but
you played safe by not givin' any definite orders, so if anything
went wrong, you could step out from under and shift the blame onto
McNab."</p>

<p>Middleton smiled appreciatively, and nodded coolly.</p>

<p>"That's right. All of it. You're no fool, Corcoran."</p>

<p>Corcoran ripped out an oath, and this glimpse of the passionate
nature that lurked under his inscrutable exterior was like a
momentary glimpse of an enraged cougar, eyes blazing, spitting and
snarling.</p>

<p>"Why?" he exclaimed. "Why did you plot all this for me? If you
had a grudge against Glanton, I can understand why you'd rib up a
trap for him, though you wouldn't have had no more luck with him
than you have with me. But you ain't got no feud against me. I
never saw you before this mornin'!"</p>

<p>"I have no feud with you; I had none with Glanton. But if Fate
hadn't thrown you into my path, it would have been Glanton who
would have been ambushed in the Blackfoot Chief. Don't you see,
Corcoran? It was a test. I had to be sure you were the man I
wanted."</p>

<p>Corcoran scowled, puzzled himself now.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Sit down!" Middleton himself sat down on a nearby chair,
unbuckled his gun-belt and threw it, with the heavy, holstered gun,
onto a table, out of easy reach. Corcoran seated himself, but his
vigilance did not relax, and his gaze rested on Middleton's left
arm pit, where a second gun might be hidden.</p>

<p>"In the first place," said Middleton, his voice flowing
tranquilly, but pitched too low to be heard outside the cabin, "I'm
chief of the Vultures, as that fool said. I organized them, even
before I was made sheriff. Killing a robber and murderer, who was
working outside my gang, made the people of Wahpeton think I'd make
a good sheriff. When they gave me the office, I saw what an
advantage it would be to me and my gang.</p>

<p>"Our organization is airtight. There are about fifty men in the
gang. They are scattered throughout these mountains. Some pose as
miners; some are gamblers&mdash;Ace Brent, for instance. He's my
right-hand man. Some work in saloons, some clerk in stores. One of
the regular drivers of the stage-line company is a Vulture, and so
is a clerk of the company, and one of the men who works in the
company's stables, tending the horses.</p>

<p>"With spies scattered all over the camp, I know who's trying to
take out gold, and when. It's a cinch. We can't lose."</p>

<p>"I don't see how the camp stands for it," grunted Corcoran.</p>

<p>"Men are too crazy after gold to think about anything else. As
long as a man isn't molested himself, he doesn't care much what
happens to his neighbors. We are organized; they are not. We know
who to trust; they don't. It can't last forever. Sooner or later
the more intelligent citizens will organize themselves into a
vigilante committee and sweep the gulch clean. But when that
happens, I intend to be far away&mdash;with one man I can
trust."</p>

<p>Corcoran nodded, comprehension beginning to gleam in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Already some men are talking vigilante. Colonel Hopkins, for
instance. I encourage him as subtly as I can."</p>

<p>"Why, in the name of Satan?"</p>

<p>"To avert suspicion; and for another reason. The vigilantes will
serve my purpose at the end."</p>

<p>"And your purpose is to skip out and leave the gang holdin' the
sack!"</p>

<p>"Exactly! Look here!"</p>

<p>Taking the candle from the table, he led the way through a back
room, where heavy shutters covered the one window. Shutting the
door, he turned to the back wall and drew aside some skins which
were hung over it. Setting the candle on a roughly hewed table, he
fumbled at the logs, and a section swung outward, revealing a heavy
plank door set in the solid rock against which the back wall of the
cabin was built. It was braced with iron and showed a ponderous
lock. Middleton produced a key, and turned it in the lock, and
pushed the door inward. He lifted the candle and revealed a small
cave, lined and heaped with canvas and buckskin sacks. One of these
sacks had burst open, and a golden stream caught the glints of the
candle.</p>

<p>"Gold! Sacks and sacks of it!"</p>

<p>Corcoran caught his breath, and his eyes glittered like a wolf's
in the candlelight. No man could visualize the contents of those
bags unmoved. And the gold-madness had long ago entered Corcoran's
veins, more powerfully than he had dreamed, even though he had
followed the lure to California and back over the mountains again.
The sight of that glittering heap, of those bulging sacks, sent his
pulses pounding in his temples, and his hand unconsciously locked
on the butt of a gun.</p>

<p>"There must be a million there!"</p>

<p>"Enough to require a good-sized mule-train to pack it out,"
answered Middleton. "You see why I have to have a man to help me
the night I pull out. And I need a man like you. You're an outdoor
man, hardened by wilderness travel. You're a frontiersman, a
<i>vaquero</i>, a trail-driver. These men I lead are mostly rats
that grew up in border towns&mdash;gamblers, thieves, barroom
gladiators, saloon-bred gunmen; a few miners gone wrong. You can
stand things that would kill any of them.</p>

<p>"The flight we'll have to make will be hard traveling. We'll
have to leave the beaten trails and strike out through the
mountains. They'll be sure to follow us, and we'll probably have to
fight them off. Then there are Indians &mdash;Blackfeet and Crows;
we may run into a war party of them. I knew I had to have a
fighting man of the keenest type; not only a fighting man, but a
man bred on the frontier. That's why I sent for Glanton. But you're
a better man than he was."</p>

<p>Corcoran frowned his suspicion.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me all this at first?"</p>

<p>"Because I wanted to try you out. I wanted to be sure you were
the right man. I had to be sure. If you were stupid enough, and
slow enough to be caught in such a trap as McNab and the rest would
set for you, you weren't the man I wanted."</p>

<p>"You're takin' a lot for granted," snapped Corcoran. "How do you
know I'll fall in with you and help you loot the camp and then
double-cross your gang? What's to prevent me from blowin' your head
off for the trick you played on me? Or spillin' the beans to
Hopkins, or to McNab?"</p>

<p>"Half a million in gold!" answered Middleton. "If you do any of
those things, you'll miss your chance to share that cache with
me."</p>

<p>He shut the door, locked it, pushed the other door to and hung
the skins over it. Taking the candle he led the way back into the
outer room.</p>

<p>He seated himself at the table and poured whisky from a jug into
two glasses.</p>

<p>"Well, what about it?"</p>

<p>Corcoran did not at once reply. His brain was still filled with
blinding golden visions. His countenance darkened, became sinister
as he meditated, staring into his whisky glass.</p>

<p>The men of the West lived by their own code. The line between
the outlaw and the honest cattleman or <i>vaquero</i> was sometimes
a hair line, too vague to always be traced with accuracy. Men's
personal codes were frequently inconsistent, but rigid as iron.
Corcoran would not have stolen one cow, or three cows from a
squatter, but he had swept across the border to loot Mexican
<i>rancherios</i> of hundreds of head. He would not hold up a man
and take his money, nor would he murder a man in cold blood; but he
felt no compunctions about killing a thief and taking the money the
thief had stolen. The gold in that cache was bloodstained, the
fruit of crimes to which he would have scorned to stoop. But his
code of honesty did not prevent him from looting it from the
thieves who had looted it in turn from honest men.</p>

<p>"What's my part in the game?" Corcoran asked abruptly.</p>

<p>Middleton grinned zestfully.</p>

<p>"Good! I thought you'd see it my way. No man could look at that
gold and refuse a share of it! They trust me more than they do any
other member of the gang. That's why I keep it here. They
know&mdash;or think they know&mdash; that I couldn't slip out with
it. But that's where we'll fool them.</p>

<p>"Your job will be just what I told McNab: you'll uphold law and
order. I'll tell the boys not to pull any more holdups inside the
town itself, and that'll give you a reputation. People will think
you've got the gang too scared to work in close. You'll enforce
laws like those against shooting up saloons, fighting on the
street, and the like. And you'll catch the thieves that are still
working alone. When you kill one we'll make it appear that he was a
Vulture. You've put yourself solid with the people tonight, by
killing those fools in the Blackfoot Chief. We'll keep up the
deception.</p>

<p>"I don't trust Ace Brent. I believe he's secretly trying to
usurp my place as chief of the gang. He's too damned smart. But I
don't want you to kill him. He has too many friends in the gang.
Even if they didn't suspect I put you up to it, even if it looked
like a private quarrel, they'd want your scalp. I'll frame
him&mdash;get somebody outside the gang to kill him, when the time
comes.</p>

<p>"When we get ready to skip, I'll set the vigilantes and the
Vultures to battling each other&mdash;how, I don't know, but I'll
find a way&mdash;and we'll sneak while they're at it. Then for
California&mdash;South America and the sharing of the gold!"</p>

<p>"The sharin' of the gold!" echoed Corcoran, his eyes lit with
grim laughter.</p>

<p>Their hard hands met across the rough table, and the same
enigmatic smile played on the lips of both men.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="vultures5" name="vultures5">V. &mdash; THE WHEEL BEGINS
TO TURN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">CORCORAN stalked through the milling crowd that
swarmed in the street, and headed toward the Golden Garter Dance
Hall and Saloon. A man lurching through the door with the wide
swing of hilarious intoxication stumbled into him and clutched at
him to keep from falling to the floor.</p>

<p>Corcoran righted him, smiling faintly into the bearded, rubicund
countenance that peered into his.</p>

<p>"Steve Corcoran, by thunder!" whooped the inebriated one
gleefully. "Besh damn' deputy in the Territory! 'S' a honor to get
picked up by Steve Corcoran! Come in and have a drink."</p>

<p>"You've had too many now," returned Corcoran.</p>

<p>"Right!" agreed the other. "I'm goin' home now, 'f I can get
there. Lasht time I was a little full, I didn't make it, by a
quarter of a mile! I went to sleep in a ditch across from your
shack. I'd 'a' come in and slept on the floor, only I was 'fraid
you'd shoot me for one of them derned Vultures!"</p>

<p>Men about them laughed. The intoxicated man was Joe Willoughby,
a prominent merchant in Wahpeton, and extremely popular for his
free-hearted and open-handed ways.</p>

<p>"Just knock on the door next time and tell me who it is,"
grinned Corcoran. "You're welcome to a blanket in the sheriff's
office, or a bunk in my room, any time you need it."</p>

<p>"Soul of gener&mdash;generoshity!" proclaimed Willoughby
boisterously. "Goin' home now before the licker gets down in my
legs. S'long, old pard!"</p>

<p>He weaved away down the street, amidst the jovial joshings of
the miners, to which he retorted with bibulous good nature.</p>

<p>Corcoran turned again into the dance hall and brushed against
another man, at whom he glanced sharply, noting the set jaw, the
haggard countenance and the bloodshot eyes. This man, a young miner
well known to Corcoran, pushed his way through the crowd and
hurried up the street with the manner of a man who goes with a
definite purpose. Corcoran hesitated, as though to follow him, then
decided against it and entered the dance hall. Half the reason for
a gunfighter's continued existence lay in his ability to read and
analyze the expressions men wore, to correctly interpret the jut of
jaw, the glitter of eye. He knew this young miner was determined on
some course of action that might result in violence. But the man
was not a criminal, and Corcoran never interfered in private
quarrels so long as they did not threaten the public safety.</p>

<p>A girl was singing, in a clear, melodious voice, to the
accompaniment of a jangling, banging piano. As Corcoran seated
himself at a table, with his back to the wall and a clear view of
the whole hall before him, she concluded her number amid a
boisterous clamor of applause. Her face lit as she saw him. Coming
lightly across the hall, she sat down at his table. She rested her
elbows on the table, cupped her chin in her hands, and fixed her
wide clear gaze on his brown face.</p>

<p>"Shot any Vultures today, Steve?"</p>

<p>He made no answer as he lifted the glass of beer brought him by
a waiter.</p>

<p>"They must be scared of you," she continued, and something of
youthful hero-worship glowed in her eyes. "There hasn't been a
murder or holdup in town for the past month, since you've been
here. Of course you can't be everywhere. They still kill men and
rob them in the camps up the ravines, but they keep out of
town.</p>

<p>"And that time you took the stage through to Yankton! It wasn't
your fault that they held it up and got the gold on the other side
of Yankton. You weren't in it, then. I wish I'd been there and seen
the fight, when you fought off the men who tried to hold you up,
halfway between here and Yankton."</p>

<p>"There wasn't any fight to it," he said impatiently, restless
under praise he knew he did not deserve.</p>

<p>"I know; they were afraid of you. You shot at them and they
ran."</p>

<p>Very true; it had been Middleton's idea for Corcoran to take the
stage through to the next town east, and beat off a fake attempt at
holdup. Corcoran had never relished the memory; whatever his
faults, he had the pride of his profession; a fake gunfight was as
repugnant to him as a business hoax to an honest businessman.</p>

<p>"Everybody knows that the stage company tried to hire you away
from Middleton, as a regular shotgun-guard. But you told them that
your business was to protect life and property here in
Wahpeton."</p>

<p>She meditated a moment and then laughed reminiscently.</p>

<p>"You know, when you pulled me off of Conchita that night, I
thought you were just another blustering bully like McNab. I was
beginning to believe that Middleton was taking pay from the
Vultures, and that his deputies were crooked. I know things that
some people don't." Her eyes became shadowed as if by an unpleasant
memory in which, though her companion could not know it, was limned
the handsome, sinister face of Ace Brent. "Or maybe people do.
Maybe they guess things, but are afraid to say anything.</p>

<p>"But I was mistaken about you, and since you're square, then
Middleton must be, too. I guess it was just too big a job for him
and his other deputies. None of them could have wiped out that gang
in the Blackfoot Chief that night like you did. It wasn't your
fault that Tom Deal got away that night, before he could be
questioned. If he hadn't though, maybe you could have made him tell
who the other Vultures were."</p>

<p>"I met Jack McBride comin' out of here," said Corcoran abruptly.
"He looked like he was about ready to start gunnin' for somebody.
Did he drink much in here?"</p>

<p>"Not much. I know what's the matter with him. He's been gambling
too much down at the <i>King of Diamonds</i>. Ace Brent has been
winning his money for a week. McBride's nearly broke, and I believe
he thinks Brent is crooked. He came in here, drank some whisky, and
let fall a remark about having a showdown with Brent."</p>

<p>Corcoran rose abruptly. "Reckon I better drift down towards the
King of Diamonds. Somethin' may bust loose there. McBride's quick
with a gun, and high tempered. Brent's deadly. Their private
business is none of my affair. But if they want to fight it out,
they'll have to get out where innocent people won't get hit by
stray slugs."</p>

<p>Glory Bland watched him as his tall, erect figure swung out of
the door, and there was a glow in her eyes that had never been
awakened there by any other man.</p>

<p>Corcoran had almost reached the <i>King of Diamonds</i> gambling
hall, when the ordinary noises of the street were split by the
crash of a heavy gun. Simultaneously men came headlong out of the
doors, shouting, shoving, plunging in their haste.</p>

<p>"McBride's killed!" bawled a hairy miner.</p>

<p>"No, it's Brent!" yelped another. The crowd surged and milled,
craning their necks to see through the windows, yet crowding back
from the door in fear of stray bullets. As Corcoran made for the
door he heard a man bawl in answer to an eager question: "McBride
accused Brent of usin' marked cards, and offered to prove it to the
crowd. Brent said he'd kill him and pulled his gun to do it. But it
snapped. I heard the hammer click. Then McBride drilled him before
he could try again."</p>

<p>Men gave way as Corcoran pushed through the crowd. Somebody
yelped: "Look out, Steve! McBride's on the warpath!"</p>

<p>Corcoran stepped into the gambling hall, which was deserted
except for the gambler who lay dead on the floor, with a
bullet-hole over his heart, and the killer who half-crouched with
his back to the bar, and a smoking gun lifted in his hand.</p>

<p>McBride's lips were twisted hard in a snarl, and he looked like
a wolf at bay.</p>

<p>"Get back, Corcoran," he warned. "I ain't got nothin' against
you, but I ain't goin' to be murdered like a sheep."</p>

<p>"Who said anything about murderin' you?" demanded Corcoran
impatiently.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know you wouldn't. But Brent's got friends. They'll never
let me get away with killin' him. I believe he was a Vulture. I
believe the Vultures will be after me for this. But if they get me,
they've got to get me fightin'."</p>

<p>"Nobody's goin' to hurt you," said Corcoran tranquilly. "You
better give me your gun and come along. I'll have to arrest you,
but it won't amount to nothin', and you ought to know it. As soon
as a miners' court can be got together, you'll be tried and
acquitted. It was a plain case of self-defense. I reckon no honest
folks will do any grievin' for Ace Brent."</p>

<p>"But if I give up my gun and go to jail," objected McBride,
wavering, "I'm afraid the toughs will take me out and lynch
me."</p>

<p>"I'm givin' you my word you won't be harmed while you're under
arrest," answered Corcoran.</p>

<p>"That's enough for me," said McBride promptly, extending his
pistol.</p>

<p>Corcoran took it and thrust it into his waistband. "It's damned
foolishness, takin' an honest man's gun," he grunted. "But
accordin' to Middleton that's the law. Give me your word that you
won't skip, till you've been properly acquitted, and I won't lock
you up."</p>

<p>"I'd rather go to jail," said McBride. "I wouldn't skip. But
I'll be safer in jail, with you guardin' me, than I would be
walkin' around loose for some of Brent's friends to shoot me in the
back. After I've been cleared by due process of law, they won't
dare to lynch me, and I ain't afraid of 'em when it comes to
gunfightin', in the open."</p>

<p>"All right." Corcoran stooped and picked up the dead gambler's
gun, and thrust it into his belt. The crowd surging about the door
gave way as he led his prisoner out.</p>

<p>"There the skunk is!" bawled a rough voice. "He murdered Ace
Brent!"</p>

<p>McBride turned pale with anger and glared into the crowd, but
Corcoran urged him along, and the miner grinned as other voices
rose: "A damned good thing, too!" "Brent was crooked!" "He was a
Vulture!" bawled somebody, and for a space a tense silence held.
That charge was too sinister to bring openly against even a dead
man. Frightened by his own indiscretion the man who had shouted
slunk away, hoping none had identified his voice.</p>

<p>"I've been gamblin' too much," growled McBride, as he strode
along beside Corcoran. "Afraid to try to take my gold out, though,
and didn't know what else to do with it. Brent won thousands of
dollars worth of dust from me; poker, mostly.</p>

<p>"This mornin' I was talkin' to Middleton, and he showed a card
he said a gambler dropped in his cabin last night. He showed me it
was marked, in a way I'd never have suspected. I recognized it as
one of the same brand Brent always uses, though Middleton wouldn't
tell me who the gambler was. But later I learned that Brent slept
off a drunk in Middleton's cabin. Damned poor business for a
gambler to get drunk.</p>

<p>"I went to the <i>King of Diamonds</i> awhile ago, and started
playin' poker with Brent and a couple of miners. As soon as he
raked in the first pot, I called him&mdash;flashed the card I got
from Middleton and started to show the boys where it was marked.
Then Brent pulled his gun; it snapped, and I killed him before he
could cock it again. He knew I had the goods on him. He didn't even
give me time to tell where I'd gotten the card."</p>

<p>Corcoran made no reply. He locked McBride in the jail, called
the jailer from his nearby shack and told him to furnish the
prisoner with food, liquor and anything else he needed, and then
hurried to his own cabin. Sitting on his bunk in the room behind
the sheriff's office, he ejected the cartridge on which Brent's
pistol had snapped. The cap was dented, but had not detonated the
powder. Looking closely he saw faint abrasions on both the bullet
and brass case. They were such as might have been made by the jaws
of iron pinchers and a vise.</p>

<p>Securing a wire-cutter with pincher jaws, he began to work at
the bullet. It slipped out with unusual ease, and the contents of
the case spilled into his hand. He did not need to use a match to
prove that it was not powder. He knew what the stuff was at first
glance&mdash;iron filings, to give the proper weight to the
cartridge from which the powder had been removed.</p>

<p>At that moment he heard someone enter the outer room, and
recognized the firm, easy tread of Sheriff Middleton. Corcoran went
into the office and Middleton turned, hung his white hat on a
nail.</p>

<p>"McNab tells me McBride killed Ace Brent!"</p>

<p>"You ought to know!" Corcoran grinned. He tossed the bullet and
empty case on the table, dumped the tiny pile of iron dust beside
them.</p>

<p>"Brent spent the night with you. You got him drunk, and stole
one of his cards to show to McBride. You knew how his cards were
marked. You took a cartridge out of Brent's gun and put that one in
place. One would be enough. You knew there'd be gunplay between him
and McBride, when you showed McBride that marked card, and you
wanted to be sure it was Brent who stopped lead."</p>

<p>"That's right," agreed Middleton. "I haven't seen you since
early yesterday morning. I was going to tell you about the frame
I'd ribbed, as soon as I saw you. I didn't know McBride would go
after Brent as quickly as he did.</p>

<p>"Brent got too ambitious. He acted as if he were suspicious of
us both, lately. Maybe, though, it was just jealousy as far as you
were concerned. He liked Glory Bland, and she could never see him.
It gouged him to see her falling for you.</p>

<p>"And he wanted my place as leader of the Vultures. If there was
one man in the gang that could have kept us from skipping with the
loot, it was Ace Brent.</p>

<p>"But I think I've worked it neatly. No one can accuse me of
having him murdered, because McBride isn't in the gang. I have no
control over him. But Brent's friends will want revenge."</p>

<p>"A miners' court will acquit McBride on the first ballot."</p>

<p>"That's true. Maybe we'd better let him get shot, trying to
escape!"</p>

<p>"We will like hell!" rapped Corcoran. "I swore he wouldn't be
harmed while he was under arrest. His part of the deal was on the
level. He didn't know Brent had a blank in his gun, any more than
Brent did. If Brent's friends want his scalp, let 'em go after
McBride, like white men ought to, when he's in a position to defend
himself."</p>

<p>"But after he's acquitted," argued Middleton, "they won't dare
gang up on him in the street, and he'll be too sharp to give them a
chance at him in the hills."</p>

<p>"What the hell do I care?" snarled Corcoran. "What difference
does it make to me whether Brent's friends get even or not? Far as
I'm concerned, he got what was comin' to him. If they ain't got the
guts to give McBride an even break, I sure ain't goin' to fix it so
they can murder him without riskin' their own hides. If I catch 'em
sneakin' around the jail for a shot at him, I'll fill 'em full of
hot lead.</p>

<p>"If I'd thought the miners would be crazy enough to do anything
to him for killin' Brent, I'd never arrested him. They won't.
They'll acquit him. Until they do, I'm responsible for him, and
I've give my word. And anybody that tries to lynch him while he's
in my charge better be damned sure they're quicker with a gun than
I am."</p>

<p>"There's nobody of that nature in Wahpeton," admitted Middleton
with a wry smile. "All right, if you feel your personal honor is
involved. But I'll have to find a way to placate Brent's friends,
or they'll be accusing me of being indifferent about what happened
to him."</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="vultures6" name="vultures6">VI. &mdash; VULTURES'
COURT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">NEXT morning Corcoran was awakened by a wild
shouting in the street. He had slept in the jail that night, not
trusting Brent's friends, but there had been no attempt at
violence. He jerked on his boots, and went out into the street,
followed by McBride, to learn what the shouting was about.</p>

<p>Men milled about in the street, even at that early
hour&mdash;for the sun was not yet up&mdash;surging about a man in
the garb of a miner. This man was astride a horse whose coat was
dark with sweat; the man was wild eyed, bareheaded, and he held his
hat in his hands, holding it down for the shouting, cursing throng
to see.</p>

<p>"Look at 'em!" he yelled. "Nuggets as big as hen eggs! I took
'em out in an hour, with a pick, diggin' in the wet sand by the
creek! And there's plenty more! It's the richest strike these hills
ever seen!"</p>

<p>"Where?" roared a hundred voices.</p>

<p>"Well, I got my claim staked out, all I need," said the man, "so
I don't mind tellin' you. It ain't twenty miles from here, in a
little canyon everybody's overlooked and passed
over&mdash;Jackrabbit Gorge! The creek's buttered with dust, and
the banks are crammed with pockets of nuggets!"</p>

<p>An exuberant whoop greeted this information, and the crowd broke
up suddenly as men raced for their shacks.</p>

<p>"New strike," sighed McBride enviously. "The whole town will be
surgin' down Jackrabbit Gorge. Wish I could go."</p>

<p>"Gimme your word you'll come back and stand trial, and you can
go," promptly offered Corcoran. McBride stubbornly shook his
head.</p>

<p>"No, not till I've been cleared legally. Anyway, only a handful
of men will get anything. The rest will be pullin' back into their
claims in Wahpeton Gulch tomorrow. Hell, I've been in plenty of
them rushes. Only a few ever get anything."</p>

<p>Colonel Hopkins and his partner Dick Bisley hurried past.
Hopkins shouted: "We'll have to postpone your trial until this rush
is over, Jack! We were going to hold it today, but in an hour there
won't be enough men in Wahpeton to impanel a jury! Sorry you can't
make the rush. If we can, Dick and I will stake out a claim for
you!"</p>

<p>"Thanks, Colonel!"</p>

<p>"No thanks! The camp owes you something for ridding it of that
scoundrel Brent. Corcoran, we'll do the same for you, if you
like."</p>

<p>"No, thanks," drawled Corcoran. "Minin's too hard work. I've got
a gold mine right here in Wahpeton that don't take so much
labor!"</p>

<p>The men burst into laughter at this conceit, and Bisley shouted
back as they hurried on: "That's right! Your salary looks like an
assay from the Comstock lode! But you earn it, all right!"</p>

<p>Joe Willoughby came rolling by, leading a seedy-looking burro on
which illy-hung pick and shovel banged against skillet and kettle.
Willoughby grasped a jug in one hand, and that he had already been
sampling it was proved by his wide-legged gait.</p>

<p>"H'ray for the new diggin's!" he whooped, brandishing the jug at
Corcoran and McBride. "Git along, jackass! I'll be scoopin' out
nuggets bigger'n this jug before night&mdash;if the licker don't
git in my legs before I git there!"</p>

<p>"And if it does, he'll fall into a ravine and wake up in the
mornin' with a fifty pound nugget in each hand," said McBride.
"He's the luckiest son of a gun in the camp; and the best
natured."</p>

<p>"I'm goin' and get some ham-and-eggs," said Corcoran. "You want
to come and eat with me, or let Pete Daley fix your breakfast
here?"</p>

<p>"I'll eat in the jail," decided McBride. "I want to stay in jail
till I'm acquitted. Then nobody can accuse me of tryin' to beat the
law in any way."</p>

<p>"All right." With a shout to the jailer, Corcoran swung across
the road and headed for the camp's most pretentious restaurant,
whose proprietor was growing rich, in spite of the terrific prices
he had to pay for vegetables and food of all kinds&mdash;prices he
passed on to his customers.</p>

<p>While Corcoran was eating, Middleton entered hurriedly, and
bending over him, with a hand on his shoulder, spoke softly in his
ear.</p>

<p>"I've just got wind that that old miner, Joe Brockman, is trying
to sneak his gold out on a pack mule, under the pretense of making
this rush. I don't know whether it's so or not, but some of the
boys up in the hills think it is, and are planning to waylay him
and kill him. If he intends getting away, he'll leave the trail to
Jackrabbit Gorge a few miles out of town, and swing back toward
Yankton, taking the trail over Grizzly Ridge&mdash;you know where
the thickets are so close. The boys will be laying for him either
on the ridge or just beyond.</p>

<p>"He hasn't enough dust to make it worth our while to take it. If
they hold him up they'll have to kill him, and we want as few
murders as possible. Vigilante sentiment is growing, in spite of
the people's trust in you and me. Get on your horse and ride to
Grizzly Ridge and see that the old man gets away safe. Tell the
boys Middleton said to lay off. If they won't listen&mdash;but they
will. They wouldn't buck you, even without my word to back you.
I'll follow the old man, and try to catch up with him before he
leaves the Jackrabbit Gorge road.</p>

<p>"I've sent McNab up to watch the jail, just as a formality. I
know McBride won't try to escape, but we mustn't be accused of
carelessness."</p>

<p>"Let McNab be mighty careful with his shootin' irons," warned
Corcoran. "No 'shot while attemptin' to escape', Middleton. I don't
trust McNab. If he lays a hand on McBride, I'll kill him as sure as
I'm sittin' here."</p>

<p>"Don't worry. McNab hated Brent. Better get going. Take the
short cut through the hills to Grizzly Ridge."</p>

<p>"Sure." Corcoran rose and hurried out in the street which was
all but deserted. Far down toward the other end of the gulch rose
the dust of the rearguard of the army which was surging toward the
new strike. Wahpeton looked almost like a deserted town in the
early morning light, foreshadowing its ultimate destiny.</p>

<p>Corcoran went to the corral beside the sheriff's cabin and
saddled a fast horse, glancing cryptically at the powerful pack
mules whose numbers were steadily increasing. He smiled grimly as
he remembered Middleton telling Colonel Hopkins that pack mules
were a good investment. As he led his horse out of the corral his
gaze fell on a man sprawling under the trees across the road,
lazily whittling. Day and night, in one way or another, the gang
kept an eye on the cabin which hid the cache of their gold.
Corcoran doubted if they actually suspected Middleton's intentions.
But they wanted to be sure that no stranger did any snooping
about.</p>

<p>Corcoran rode into a ravine that straggled away from the gulch,
and a few minutes later he followed a narrow path to its rim, and
headed through the mountains toward the spot, miles away, where a
trail crossed Grizzly Ridge, a long, steep backbone, thickly
timbered.</p>

<p>He had not left the ravine far behind him when a quick rattle of
hoofs brought him around, in time to see a horse slide recklessly
down a low bluff amid a shower of shale. He swore at the sight of
its rider.</p>

<p>"Glory! What the hell?"</p>

<p>"Steve!" She reined up breathlessly beside him. "Go back! It's a
trick! I heard Buck Gorman talking to Conchita; he's sweet on her.
He's a friend of Brent's&mdash;a Vulture! She twists all his
secrets out of him. Her room is next to mine, she thought I was
out. I overheard them talking. Gorman said a trick had been played
on you to get you out of town. He didn't say how. Said you'd go to
Grizzly Ridge on a wild-goose chase. While you're gone they're
going to assemble a 'miners' court,' out of the riff-raff left in
town. They're going to appoint a 'judge' and 'jury,' take McBride
out of jail, try him for killing Ace Brent&mdash;and hang him!"</p>

<p>A lurid oath ripped through Steve Corcoran's lips, and for an
instant the tiger flashed into view, eyes blazing, fangs bared.
Then his dark face was an inscrutable mask again. He wrenched his
horse around.</p>

<p>"Much obliged, Glory. I'll be dustin' back into town. You circle
around and come in another way. I don't want folks to know you told
me."</p>

<p>"Neither do I!" she shuddered. "I knew Ace Brent was a Vulture.
He boasted of it to me, once when he was drunk. But I never dared
tell anyone. He told me what he'd do to me if I did. I'm glad he's
dead. I didn't know Gorman was a Vulture, but I might have guessed
it. He was Brent's closest friend. If they ever find out I told
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They won't," Corcoran assured her. It was natural for a girl to
fear such black-hearted rogues as the Vultures, but the thought of
them actually harming her never entered his mind. He came from a
country where not even the worst of scoundrels would ever dream of
hurting a woman.</p>

<p>He drove his horse at a reckless gallop back the way he had
come, but not all the way. Before he reached the Gulch he swung
wide of the ravine he had followed out, and plunged into another,
that would bring him into the Gulch at the end of town where the
jail stood. As he rode down it he heard a deep, awesome roar he
recognized&mdash;the roar of the man-pack, hunting its own
kind.</p>

<p>A band of men surged up the dusty street, roaring, cursing. One
man waved a rope. Pale faces of bartenders, store clerks and dance
hall girls peered timidly out of doorways as the unsavory mob
roared past. Corcoran knew them, by sight or reputation:
plug-uglies, barroom loafers, skulkers&mdash;many were Vultures, as
he knew; others were riff-raff, ready for any sort of deviltry that
required neither courage nor intelligence&mdash;the scum that
gathers in any mining camp.</p>

<p>Dismounting, Corcoran glided through the straggling trees that
grew behind the jail, and heard McNab challenge the mob.</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"We aim to try your prisoner!" shouted the leader. "We come in
the due process of law. We've app'inted a jedge and paneled a jury,
and we demands that you hand over the prisoner to be tried in
miners' court, accordin' to legal precedent!"</p>

<p>"How do I know you're representative of the camp?" parried
McNab.</p>

<p>"'Cause we're the only body of men in camp right now!" yelled
someone, and this was greeted by a roar of laughter.</p>

<p>"We come empowered with the proper authority&mdash;" began the
leader, and broke off suddenly: "Grab him, boys!"</p>

<p>There was the sound of a brief scuffle, McNab swore vigorously,
and the leader's voice rose triumphantly: "Let go of him, boys, but
don't give him his gun. McNab, you ought to know better'n to try to
oppose legal procedure, and you a upholder of law and order!"</p>

<p>Again a roar of sardonic laughter, and McNab growled: "All
right; go ahead with the trial. But you do it over my protests. I
don't believe this is a representative assembly."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," averred the leader, and then his voice thickened
with blood-lust. "Now, Daley, gimme that key and bring out the
prisoner."</p>

<p>The mob surged toward the door of the jail, and at that instant
Corcoran stepped around the corner of the cabin and leaped up on
the low porch it boasted. There was a hissing intake of breath. Men
halted suddenly, digging their heels against the pressure behind
them. The surging line wavered backward, leaving two figures
isolated&mdash;McNab, scowling, disarmed, and a hairy giant whose
huge belly was girt with a broad belt bristling with gun butts and
knife hilts. He held a noose in one hand, and his bearded lips
gaped as he glared at the unexpected apparition.</p>

<p>For a breathless instant Corcoran did not speak. He did not look
at McBride's pallid countenance peering through the barred door
behind him. He stood facing the mob, his head slightly bent, a
somber, immobile figure, sinister with menace.</p>

<p>"Well," he said finally, softly, "what's holdin' up the
<i>baile</i>?"</p>

<p>The leader blustered feebly.</p>

<p>"We come here to try a murderer!"</p>

<p>Corcoran lifted his head and the man involuntarily recoiled at
the lethal glitter of his eyes.</p>

<p>"Who's your judge?" the Texan inquired softly.</p>

<p>"We appointed Jake Bissett, there," spoke up a man, pointing at
the uncomfortable giant on the porch.</p>

<p>"So you're goin' to hold a miners' court," murmured Corcoran.
"With a judge and jury picked out of the dives and
honky-tonks&mdash;scum and dirt of the gutter!" And suddenly
uncontrollable fury flamed in his eyes. Bissett, sensing his
intention, bellowed in ox-like alarm and grabbed frantically at a
gun. His fingers had scarcely touched the checkered butt when smoke
and flame roared from Corcoran's right hip. Bissett pitched
backward off the porch as if he had been struck by a hammer; the
rope tangled about his limbs as he fell, and he lay in the dust
that slowly turned crimson, his hairy fingers twitching
spasmodically.</p>

<p>Corcoran faced the mob, livid under his sun-burnt bronze. His
eyes were coals of blue hell's-fire. There was a gun in each hand,
and from the right-hand muzzle a wisp of blue smoke drifted lazily
upward.</p>

<p>"I declare this court adjourned!" he roared. "The judge is done
impeached, and the jury's discharged! I'll give you thirty seconds
to clear the courtroom!"</p>

<p>He was one man against nearly a hundred, but he was a grey wolf
facing a pack of yapping jackals. Each man knew that if the mob
surged on him, they would drag him down at last; but each man knew
what an awful toll would first be paid, and each man feared that he
himself would be one of those to pay that toll.</p>

<p>They hesitated, stumbled back&mdash;gave way suddenly and
scattered in all directions. Some backed away, some shamelessly
turned their backs and fled. With a snarl Corcoran thrust his guns
back in their scabbards and turned toward the door where McBride
stood, grasping the bars.</p>

<p>"I thought I was a goner that time, Corcoran," he gasped. The
Texan pulled the door open, and pushed McBride's pistol into his
hand.</p>

<p>"There's a horse tied behind the jail," said Corcoran. "Get on
it and dust out of here. I'll take the full responsibility. If you
stay here they'll burn down the jail, or shoot you through the
window. You can make it out of town while they're scattered. I'll
explain to Middleton and Hopkins. In a month or so, if you want to,
come back and stand trial, as a matter of formality. Things will be
cleaned up around here by then."</p>

<p>McBride needed no urging. The grisly fate he had just escaped
had shaken his nerve. Shaking Corcoran's hand passionately, he ran
stumblingly through the trees to the horse Corcoran had left there.
A few moments later he was fogging it out of the Gulch.</p>

<p>McNab came up, scowling and grumbling.</p>

<p>"You had no authority to let him go. I tried to stop the
mob&mdash;"</p>

<p>Corcoran wheeled and faced him, making no attempt to conceal his
hatred.</p>

<p>"You did like hell! Don't pull that stuff with me, McNab. You
was in on this, and so was Middleton. You put up a bluff of talk,
so afterwards you could tell Colonel Hopkins and the others that
you tried to stop the lynchin' and was overpowered. I saw the scrap
you put up when they grabbed you! Hell! You're a rotten actor."</p>

<p>"You can't talk to me like that!" roared McNab.</p>

<p>The old tigerish light flickered in the blue eyes. Corcoran did
not exactly move, yet he seemed to sink into a half-crouch, as a
cougar does for the killing spring.</p>

<p>"If you don't like my style, McNab," he said softly, thickly,
"you're more'n welcome to open the <i>baile</i> whenever you get
ready!"</p>

<p>For an instant they faced each other, McNab black browed and
scowling, Corcoran's thin lips almost smiling, but blue fire
lighting his eyes. Then with a grunt McNab turned and slouched
away, his shaggy head swaying from side to side like that of a
surly bull.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="vultures7" name="vultures7">VII. &mdash; A VULTURE'S
WINGS ARE CLIPPED</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">MIDDLETON pulled up his horse suddenly as Corcoran
reined out of the bushes. One glance showed the sheriff that
Corcoran's mood was far from placid. They were amidst a grove of
alders, perhaps a mile from the Gulch.</p>

<p>"Why, hello, Corcoran," began Middleton, concealing his
surprise. "I caught up with Brockman. It was just a wild rumor. He
didn't have any gold. That&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Drop it!" snapped Corcoran. "I know why you sent me off on that
wild-goose chase&mdash;same reason you pulled out of town. To give
Brent's friends a chance to get even with McBride. If I hadn't
turned around and dusted back into Wahpeton, McBride would be
kickin' his life out at the end of a rope, right now."</p>

<p>"You came back&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yeah! And now Jake Bissett's in Hell instead of Jack McBride,
and McBride's dusted out&mdash;on a horse I gave him. I told you I
gave him my word he wouldn't be lynched."</p>

<p>"You killed Bissett?"</p>

<p>"Deader'n hell!"</p>

<p>"He was a Vulture," muttered Middleton, but he did not seem
displeased. "Brent, Bissett&mdash;the more Vultures die, the easier
it will be for us to get away when we go. That's one reason I had
Brent killed. But you should have let them hang McBride. Of course
I framed this affair; I had to do something to satisfy Brent's
friends. Otherwise they might have gotten suspicious.</p>

<p>"If they suspicioned I had anything to do with having him
killed, or thought I wasn't anxious to punish the man who killed
him, they'd make trouble for me. I can't have a split in the gang
now. And even I can't protect you from Brent's friends, after
this."</p>

<p>"Have I ever asked you, or any man, for protection?" The quick
jealous pride of the gunfighter vibrated in his voice.</p>

<p>"Breckman, Red Bill, Curly, and now Bissett. You've killed too
many Vultures. I made them think the killing of the first three was
a mistake, all around. Bissett wasn't very popular. But they won't
forgive you for stopping them from hanging the man who killed Ace
Brent. They won't attack you openly, of course. But you'll have to
watch every step you make. They'll kill you if they can, and I
won't be able to prevent them."</p>

<p>"If I'd tell 'em just how Ace Brent died, you'd be in the same
boat," said Corcoran bitingly. "Of course, I won't. Our final
getaway depends on you keepin' their confidence&mdash;as well as
the confidence of the honest folks. This last killin' ought to put
me, and therefore you, ace-high with Hopkins and his crowd."</p>

<p>"They're still talking vigilante. I encourage it. It's coming
anyway. Murders in the outlying camps are driving men to a frenzy
of fear and rage, even though such crimes have ceased in Wahpeton.
Better to fall in line with the inevitable and twist it to a man's
own ends, than to try to oppose it. If you can keep Brent's friends
from killing you for a few more weeks, we'll be ready to jump. Look
out for Buck Gorman. He's the most dangerous man in the gang. He
was Brent's friend, and he has his own friends&mdash;all dangerous
men. Don't kill him unless you have to."</p>

<p>"I'll take care of myself," answered Corcoran somberly. "I
looked for Gorman in the mob, but he wasn't there. Too smart. But
he's the man behind the mob. Bissett was just a stupid ox; Gorman
planned it&mdash;or rather, I reckon he helped you plan it."</p>

<p>"I'm wondering how you found out about it," said Middleton. "You
wouldn't have come back unless somebody told you. Who was it?"</p>

<p>"None of your business," growled Corcoran. It did not occur to
him that Glory Bland would be in any danger from Middleton, even if
the sheriff knew about her part in the affair, but he did not
relish being questioned, and did not feel obliged to answer
anybody's queries.</p>

<p>"That new gold strike sure came in mighty handy for you and
Gorman," he said. "Did you frame that, too?"</p>

<p>Middleton nodded.</p>

<p>"Of course. That was one of my men who poses as a miner. He had
a hatful of nuggets from the cache. He served his purpose and
joined the men who hide up there in the hills. The mob of miners
will be back tomorrow, tired and mad and disgusted, and when they
hear about what happened, they'll recognize the handiwork of the
Vultures; at least some of them will. But they won't connect me
with it in any way. Now we'll ride back to town. Things are
breaking our way, in spite of your foolish interference with the
mob. But let Gorman alone. You can't afford to make any more
enemies in the gang."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Buck Gorman leaned on the bar in the Golden Eagle and expressed
his opinion of Steve Corcoran in no uncertain terms. The crowd
listened sympathetically, for, almost to a man, they were the
ruffians and riff-raff of the camp.</p>

<p>"The dog pretends to be a deputy!" roared Gorman, whose
bloodshot eyes and damp tangled hair attested to the amount of
liquor he had drunk. "But he kills an appointed judge, breaks up a
court and drives away the jury&mdash; yes, and releases the
prisoner, a man charged with murder!"</p>

<p>It was the day after the fake gold strike, and the disillusioned
miners were drowning their chagrin in the saloons. But few honest
miners were in the Golden Eagle.</p>

<p>"Colonel Hopkins and other prominent citizens held an
investigation," said someone. "They declared that evidence showed
Corcoran to have been justified&mdash;denounced the court as a mob,
acquitted Corcoran of killing Bissett, and then went ahead and
acquitted McBride for killing Brent, even though he wasn't
there."</p>

<p>Gorman snarled like a cat, and reached for his whisky glass. His
hand did not twitch or quiver, his movements were more catlike than
ever. The whisky had inflamed his mind, illumined his brain with a
white-hot certainty that was akin to insanity, but it had not
affected his nerves or any part of his muscular system. He was more
deadly drunk than sober.</p>

<p>"I was Brent's best friend!" he roared. "I was Bissett's
friend."</p>

<p>"They say Bissett was a Vulture," whispered a voice. Gorman
lifted his tawny head and glared about the room as a lion might
glare.</p>

<p>"Who says he was a Vulture? Why don't these slanderers accuse a
living man? It's always a dead man they accuse! Well, what if he
was? He was my friend! Maybe that makes <i>me</i> a Vulture!"</p>

<p>No one laughed or spoke as his flaming gaze swept the room, but
each man, as those blazing eyes rested on him in turn, felt the
chill breath of Death blowing upon him.</p>

<p>"Bissett a Vulture!" he said, wild enough with drink and fury to
commit any folly, as well as any atrocity. He did not heed the eyes
fixed on him, some in fear, a few in intense interest. "Who knows
who the Vultures are? Who knows who, or what anybody really is? Who
really knows anything about this man Corcoran, for instance? I
could tell&mdash;"</p>

<p>A light step on the threshold brought him about as Corcoran
loomed in the door. Gorman froze, snarling, lips writhed back, a
tawny-maned incarnation of hate and menace.</p>

<p>"I heard you was makin' a talk about me down here, Gorman," said
Corcoran. His face was bleak and emotionless as that of a stone
image, but his eyes burned with murderous purpose.</p>

<p>Gorman snarled wordlessly.</p>

<p>"I looked for you in the mob," said Corcoran, tonelessly, his
voice as soft and without emphasis as the even strokes of a
feather. It seemed almost as if his voice were a thing apart from
him; his lips murmuring while all the rest of his being was tense
with concentration on the man before him.</p>

<p>"You wasn't there. You sent your coyotes, but you didn't have
the guts to come yourself, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The dart of Gorman's hand to his gun was like the blurring
stroke of a snake's head, but no eye could follow Corcoran's hand.
His gun smashed before anyone knew he had reached for it. Like an
echo came the roar of Gorman's shot. But the bullet ploughed
splinteringly into the floor, from a hand that was already
death-stricken and falling. Gorman pitched over and lay still, the
swinging lamp glinting on his upturned spurs and the blue steel of
the smoking gun which lay by his hand.</p>

<h2><a id="vultures8" name="vultures8">VIII. &mdash; THE COMING OF
THE VIGILANTES</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">COLONEL HOPKINS looked absently at the liquor in
his glass, stirred restlessly, and said abruptly: "Middleton, I
might as well come to the point. My friends and I have organized a
vigilante committee, just as we should have done months ago. Now,
wait a minute. Don't take this as a criticism of your methods.
You've done wonders in the last month, ever since you brought Steve
Corcoran in here. Not a holdup in the town, not a
killing&mdash;that is, not a murder, and only a few shootings among
the honest citizens.</p>

<p>"Added to that the ridding of the camp of such scoundrels as
Jake Bissett and Buck Gorman. They were both undoubtedly members of
the Vultures. I wish Corcoran hadn't killed Gorman just when he
did, though. The man was drunk, and about to make some reckless
disclosures about the gang. At least that's what a friend of mine
thinks, who was in the Golden Eagle that night. But anyway it
couldn't be helped.</p>

<p>"No, we're not criticizing you at all. But obviously you can't
stop the murders and robberies that are going on up and down the
Gulch, all the time. And you can't stop the outlaws from holding up
the stage regularly.</p>

<p>"So that's where we come in. We have sifted the camp, carefully,
over a period of months, until we have fifty men we can trust
absolutely. It's taken a long time, because we've had to be sure of
our men. We didn't want to take in a man who might be a spy for the
Vultures. But at last we know where we stand. We're not sure just
who <i>is</i> a Vulture, but we know who <i>isn't</i>, in as far as
our organization is concerned.</p>

<p>"We can work together, John. We have no intention of interfering
within your jurisdiction, or trying to take the law out of your
hands. We demand a free hand outside the camp; inside the limits of
Wahpeton we are willing to act under your orders, or at least
according to your advice. Of course we will work in absolute
secrecy until we have proof enough to strike."</p>

<p>"You must remember, Colonel," reminded Middleton, "that all
along I've admitted the impossibility of my breaking up the
Vultures with the limited means at my disposal. I've never opposed
a vigilante committee. All I've demanded was that when it was
formed, it should be composed of honest men, and be free of any
element which might seek to twist its purpose into the wrong
channels."</p>

<p>"That's true. I didn't expect any opposition from you, and I can
assure you that we'll always work hand-in-hand with you and your
deputies." He hesitated, as if over something unpleasant, and then
said: "John, are you sure of <i>all</i> your deputies?"</p>

<p>Middleton's head jerked up and he shot a startled glance at the
Colonel, as if the latter had surprised him by putting into words a
thought that had already occurred to him.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask?" he parried.</p>

<p>"Well," Hopkins was embarrassed, "I don't know&mdash;maybe I'm
prejudiced&mdash;but&mdash;well, damn it, to put it bluntly, I've
sometimes wondered about Bill McNab!"</p>

<p>Middleton filled the glasses again before he answered.</p>

<p>"Colonel, I never accuse a man without iron-clad evidence. I'm
not always satisfied with McNab's actions, but it may merely be the
man's nature. He's a surly brute. But he has his virtues. I'll tell
you frankly, the reason I haven't discharged him is that I'm not
sure of him. That probably sounds ambiguous."</p>

<p>"Not at all. I appreciate your position. You have as much as
said you suspect him of double-dealing, and are keeping him on your
force so you can watch him. Your wits are not dull, John.
Frankly&mdash;and this will probably surprise you&mdash;until a
month ago some of the men were beginning to whisper some queer
things about you&mdash;queer suspicions, that is. But your bringing
Corcoran in showed us that you were on the level. You'd have never
brought him in if you'd been taking pay from the Vultures!"</p>

<p>Middleton halted with his glass at his lips.</p>

<p>"Great heavens!" he ejaculated. "Did they suspect me of
<i>that</i>?"</p>

<p>"Just a fool idea some of the men had," Hopkins assured him. "Of
course I never gave it a thought. The men who thought it are
ashamed now. The killing of Bissett, of Gorman, of the men in the
Blackfoot Chief, show that Corcoran's on the level. And of course,
he's merely taking his orders from you. All those men were
Vultures, of course. It's a pity Tom Deal got away before we could
question him." He rose to go.</p>

<p>"McNab was guarding Deal," said Middleton, and his tone implied
more than his words said.</p>

<p>Hopkins shot him a startled glance.</p>

<p>"By heaven, so he was! But he was really wounded&mdash;I saw the
bullet hole in his arm, where Deal shot him in making his
getaway."</p>

<p>"That's true." Middleton rose and reached for his hat. "I'll
walk along with you. I want to find Corcoran and tell him what
you've just told me."</p>

<p>"It's been a week since he killed Gorman," mused Hopkins. "I've
been expecting Gorman's Vulture friends to try to get him, any
time."</p>

<p>"So have I!" answered Middleton, with a grimness which his
companion missed.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="vultures9" name="vultures9">IX. &mdash; THE VULTURES
SWOOP</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DOWN the gulch lights blazed; the windows of
cabins were yellow squares in the night, and beyond them the velvet
sky reflected the lurid heart of the camp. The intermittent breeze
brought faint strains of music and the other noises of hilarity.
But up the gulch, where a clump of trees straggled near an
unlighted cabin, the darkness of the moonless night was a mask that
the faint stars did not illuminate.</p>

<p>Figures moved in the deep shadows of the trees, voices
whispered, their furtive tones mingling with the rustling of the
wind through the leaves.</p>

<p>"We ain't close enough. We ought to lay alongside his cabin and
blast him as he goes in."</p>

<p>A second voice joined the first, muttering like a bodyless voice
in a conclave of ghosts.</p>

<p>"We've gone all over that. I tell you this is the best way. Get
him off guard. You're sure Middleton was playin' cards at the
<i>King of Diamonds</i>?"</p>

<p>Another voice answered: "He'll be there till daylight,
likely."</p>

<p>"He'll be awful mad," whispered the first speaker.</p>

<p>"Let him. He can't afford to do anything about it.
<i>Listen!</i> Somebody's comin' up the road!"</p>

<p>They crouched down in the bushes, merging with the blacker
shadows. They were so far from the cabin, and it was so dark, that
the approaching figure was only a dim blur in the gloom.</p>

<p>"It's him!" a voice hissed fiercely, as the blur merged with the
bulkier shadow that was the cabin.</p>

<p>In the stillness a door rasped across a sill. A yellow light
sprang up, streaming through the door, blocking out a small window
high up in the wall. The man inside did not cross the lighted
doorway, and the window was too high to see through into the
cabin.</p>

<p>The light went out after a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Come on!" The three men rose and went stealthily toward the
cabin. Their bare feet made no sound, for they had discarded their
boots. Coats too had been discarded, any garment that might swing
loosely and rustle, or catch on projections. Cocked guns were in
their hands, they could have been no more wary had they been
approaching the lair of a lion. And each man's heart pounded
suffocatingly, for the prey they stalked was far more dangerous
than any lion.</p>

<p>When one spoke it was so low that his companions hardly heard
him with their ears a matter of inches from his bearded lips.</p>

<p>"We'll take our places like we planned, Joel. You'll go to the
door and call him, like we told you. He knows Middleton trusts you.
He don't know you'd be helpin' Gorman's friends. He'll recognize
your voice, and he won't suspect nothin'. When he comes to the door
and opens it, step back into the shadows and fall flat. We'll do
the rest from where we'll be layin'."</p>

<p>His voice shook slightly as he spoke, and the other man
shuddered; his face was a pallid oval in the darkness.</p>

<p>"I'll do it, but I bet he kills some of us. I bet he kills me,
anyway. I must have been crazy when I said I'd help you
fellows."</p>

<p>"You can't back out now!" hissed the other. They stole forward,
their guns advanced, their hearts in their mouths. Then the
foremost man caught at the arms of his companions.</p>

<p>"Wait! Look there! He's left the door open!"</p>

<p>The open doorway was a blacker shadow in the shadow of the
wall.</p>

<p>"He knows we're after him!" There was a catch of hysteria in the
babbling whisper. "It's a trap!"</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool! How could he know? He's asleep. I hear him
snorin'. We won't wake him. We'll step into the cabin and let him
have it! We'll have enough light from the window to locate the
bunk, and we'll rake it with lead before he can move. He'll wake up
in Hell. Come on, and for God's sake, don't make no noise!"</p>

<p>The last advice was unnecessary. Each man, as he set his bare
foot down, felt as if he were setting it into the lair of a
diamond-backed rattler.</p>

<p>As they glided, one after another, across the threshold, they
made less noise than the wind blowing through the black branches.
They crouched by the door, straining their eyes across the room,
whence came the rhythmic snoring. Enough light sifted through the
small window to show them a vague outline that was a bunk, with a
shapeless mass upon it.</p>

<p>A man caught his breath in a short, uncontrollable gasp. Then
the cabin was shaken by a thunderous volley, three guns roaring
together. Lead swept the bunk in a devastating storm, thudding into
flesh and bone, smacking into wood. A wild cry broke in a gagging
gasp. Limbs thrashed wildly and a heavy body tumbled to the floor.
From the darkness on the floor beside the bunk welled up hideous
sounds, choking gurgles and a convulsive flopping and thumping. The
men crouching near the door poured lead blindly at the sounds.
There was fear and panic in the haste and number of their shots.
They did not cease jerking their triggers until their guns were
empty, and the noises on the floor had ceased.</p>

<p>"Out of here, quick!" gasped one.</p>

<p>"No! Here's the table, and a candle on it. I felt it in the
dark. I've got to <i>know</i> that he's dead before I leave this
cabin. I've got to see him lyin' dead if I'm goin' to sleep easy.
We've got plenty of time to get away. Folks down the gulch must
have heard the shots, but it'll take time for them to get here. No
danger. I'm goin' to light the candle!"</p>

<p>There was a rasping sound, and a yellow light sprang up, etching
three staring, bearded faces. Wisps of blue smoke blurred the light
as the candle wick ignited from the fumbling match, but the men saw
a huddled shape crumpled near the bunk, from which streams of dark
crimson radiated in every direction.</p>

<p><i>"Ahhh!"</i>
</p>

<p>They whirled at the sound of running footsteps.</p>

<p>"Oh, God!" shrieked one of the men, falling to his knees, his
hands lifted to shut out a terrible sight. The other ruffians
staggered with the shock of what they saw. They stood gaping,
livid, helpless, empty guns sagging in their hands.</p>

<p>For in the doorway, glaring in dangerous amazement, with a gun
in each hand, stood the man whose lifeless body they thought lay
over there by the splintered bunk!</p>

<p>"Drop them guns!" Corcoran rasped. They clattered on the floor
as the hands of their owner mechanically reached skyward. The man
on the floor staggered up, his hands empty; he retched, shaken by
the nausea of fear.</p>

<p>"Joel Miller!" said Corcoran evenly; his surprise was passed, as
he realized what had happened. "Didn't know you run with Gorman's
crowd. Reckon Middleton'll be some surprised, too."</p>

<p>"You're a devil!" gasped Miller. "You can't be killed! We killed
you &mdash;heard you roll off your bunk and die on the floor, in
the dark. We kept shooting after we knew you were dead. But you're
alive!"</p>

<p>"You didn't shoot me," grunted Corcoran. "You shot a man you
thought was me. I was comin' up the road when I heard the shots.
You killed Joe Willoughby! He was drunk and I reckon he staggered
in here and fell in my bunk, like he's done before."</p>

<p>The men went whiter yet under their bushy beards, with rage and
chagrin and fear.</p>

<p>"Willoughby!" babbled Miller. "The camp will never stand for
this! Let us go, Corcoran! Hopkins and his crowd will hang us!
It'll mean the end of the Vultures! Your end, too, Corcoran! If
they hang us, we'll talk first! They'll find out that you're one of
us!"</p>

<p>"In that case," muttered Corcoran, his eyes narrowing, "I'd
better kill the three of you. That's the sensible solution. You
killed Willoughby, tryin' to get me; I kill you, in
self-defense."</p>

<p>"Don't do it, Corcoran!" screamed Miller, frantic with
terror.</p>

<p>"Shut up, you dog," growled one of the other men, glaring
balefully at their captor. "Corcoran wouldn't shoot down unarmed
men."</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't," said Corcoran. "Not unless you made some kind
of a break. I'm peculiar that way, which I see is a handicap in
this country. But it's the way I was raised, and I can't get over
it. No, I ain't goin' to beef you cold, though you've just tried to
get me that way.</p>

<p>"But I'll be damned if I'm goin' to let you sneak off, to come
back here and try it again the minute you get your nerve bucked up.
I'd about as soon be hanged by the vigilantes as shot in the back
by a passle of rats like you-all. Vultures, hell! You ain't even
got the guts to be good buzzards.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to take you down the gulch and throw you in jail.
It'll be up to Middleton to decide what to do with you. He'll
probably work out some scheme that'll swindle everybody except
himself; but I warn you&mdash;one yap about the Vultures to
anybody, and I'll forget my raisin' and send you to Hell with your
belts empty and your boots on."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>The noise in the <i>King of Diamonds</i> was hushed suddenly as
a man rushed in and bawled: "The Vultures have murdered Joe
Willoughby! Steve Corcoran caught three of 'em, and has just locked
'em up! This time we've got some live Vultures to work on!"</p>

<p>A roar answered him and the gambling hall emptied itself as men
rushed yelling into the street. John Middleton laid down his hand
of cards, donned his white hat with a hand that was steady as a
rock, and strode after them.</p>

<p>Already a crowd was surging and roaring around the jail. The
miners were lashed into a murderous frenzy and were restrained from
shattering the door and dragging forth the cowering prisoners only
by the presence of Corcoran, who faced them on the jail-porch.
McNab, Richardson and Stark were there, also. McNab was pale under
his whiskers, and Stark seemed nervous and ill at ease, but
Richardson, as always, was cold as ice.</p>

<p>"Hang 'em!" roared the mob. "Let us have 'em, Steve! You've done
your part! This camp's put up with enough! Let us have 'em!"</p>

<p>Middleton climbed up on the porch, and was greeted by loud
cheers, but his efforts to quiet the throng proved futile. Somebody
brandished a rope with a noose in it. Resentment, long smoldering,
was bursting into flame, fanned by hysterical fear and hate. The
mob had no wish to harm either Corcoran or Middleton&mdash;did not
intend to harm them. But they were determined to drag out the
prisoners and string them up.</p>

<p>Colonel Hopkins forced his way through the crowd, mounted the
step, and waved his hands until he obtained a certain amount of
silence.</p>

<p>"Listen, men!" he roared, "this is the beginning of a new era
for Wahpeton! This camp has been terrorized long enough. We're
beginning a rule of law and order, right now! But don't spoil it at
the very beginning! These men shall hang&mdash;I swear it! But
let's do it legally, and with the sanction of law. Another thing:
if you hang them out of hand, we'll never learn who their
companions and leaders are.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, I promise you, a court of inquiry will sit on their
case. They'll be questioned and forced to reveal the men above and
behind them. This camp is going to be cleaned up! Let's clean it up
lawfully and in order!"</p>

<p>"Colonel's right!" bawled a bearded giant. "Ain't no use to hang
the little rats till we find out who's the big 'uns!"</p>

<p>A roar of approbation rose as the temper of the mob changed. It
began to break up, as the men scattered to hasten back to the bars
and indulge in their passion to discuss the new development.</p>

<p>Hopkins shook Corcoran's hand heartily.</p>

<p>"Congratulations, sir! I've seen poor Joe's body. A terrible
sight. The fiends fairly shot the poor fellow to ribbons.
Middleton, I told you the vigilantes wouldn't usurp your authority
in Wahpeton. I keep my word. We'll leave these murderers in your
jail, guarded by your deputies. Tomorrow the vigilante court will
sit in session, and I hope we'll come to the bottom of this filthy
mess."</p>

<p>And so saying he strode off, followed by a dozen or so
steely-eyed men whom Middleton knew formed the nucleus of the
Colonel's organization.</p>

<p>When they were out of hearing, Middleton stepped to the door and
spoke quickly to the prisoners: "Keep your mouths shut. You fools
have gotten us all in a jam, but I'll snake you out of it,
somehow." To McNab he spoke: "Watch the jail. Don't let anybody
come near it. Corcoran and I have got to talk this over." Lowering
his voice so the prisoners could not hear, he added: "If anybody
does come, that you can't order off, and these fools start shooting
off their heads, close their mouths with lead."</p>

<p>Corcoran followed Middleton into the shadow of the gulch wall.
Out of earshot of the nearest cabin, Middleton turned. "Just what
happened?"</p>

<p>"Gorman's friends tried to get me. They killed Joe Willoughby by
mistake. I hauled them in. That's all."</p>

<p>"That's not all," muttered Middleton. "There'll be hell to pay
if they come to trial. Miller's yellow. He'll talk, sure. I've been
afraid Gorman's friends would try to kill you&mdash;wondering how
it would work out. It's worked out just about the worst way it
possibly could. You should either have killed them or let them go.
Yet I appreciate your attitude. You have scruples against
cold-blooded murder; and if you'd turned them loose, they'd have
been back potting at you the next night."</p>

<p>"I couldn't have turned them loose if I'd wanted to. Men had
heard the shots; they came runnin'; found me there holdin' a gun on
those devils, and Joe Willoughby's body layin' on the floor, shot
to pieces."</p>

<p>"I know. But we can't keep members of our own gang in jail, and
we can't hand them over to the vigilantes. I've got to delay that
trial, somehow. If I were ready, we'd jump tonight, and to hell
with it. But I'm not ready. After all, perhaps it's as well this
happened. It may give us our chance to skip. We're one jump ahead
of the vigilantes and the gang, too. We know the vigilantes have
formed and are ready to strike, and the rest of the gang don't.
I've told no one but you what Hopkins told me early in the
evening.</p>

<p>"Listen, Corcoran, we've got to move tomorrow night! I wanted to
pull one last job, the biggest of all&mdash;the looting of Hopkins
and Bisley's private cache. I believe I could have done it, in
spite of all their guards and precautions. But we'll have to let
that slide. I'll persuade Hopkins to put off the trial another day.
I think I know how. Tomorrow night I'll have the vigilantes and the
Vultures at each others' throats! We'll load the mules and pull out
while they're fighting. Once let us get a good start, and they're
welcome to chase us if they want to.</p>

<p>"I'm going to find Hopkins now. You get back to the jail. If
McNab talks to Miller or the others, be sure you listen to what's
said."</p>

<p>Middleton found Hopkins in the Golden Eagle Saloon.</p>

<p>"I've come to ask a favor of you, Colonel," he began directly.
"I want you, if it's possible, to put off the investigating trial
until day after tomorrow. I've been talking to Joel Miller. He's
cracking. If I can get him away from Barlow and Letcher, and talk
to him, I believe he'll tell me everything I want to know. It'll be
better to get his confession, signed and sworn to, before we bring
the matter into court. Before a judge, with all eyes on him, and
his friends in the crowd, he might stiffen and refuse to
incriminate anyone. I don't believe the others will talk. But
talking to me, alone, I believe Miller will spill the whole works.
But it's going to take time to wear him down. I believe that by
tomorrow night I'll have a full confession from him."</p>

<p>"That would make our work a great deal easier," admitted
Hopkins.</p>

<p>"And another thing: these men ought to be represented by proper
counsel. You'll prosecute them, of course; and the only other
lawyer within reach is Judge Bixby, at Yankton. We're doing this
thing in as close accordance to regular legal procedure as
possible. Therefore we can't refuse the prisoner the right to be
defended by an attorney. I've sent a man after Bixby. It will be
late tomorrow evening before he can get back with the Judge, even
if he has no trouble in locating him.</p>

<p>"Considering all these things, I feel it would be better to
postpone the trial until we can get Bixby here, and until I can get
Miller's confession."</p>

<p>"What will the camp think?"</p>

<p>"Most of them are men of reason. The few hotheads who might want
to take matters into their own hands can't do any harm."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Hopkins. "After all, they're your prisoners,
since your deputy captured them, and the attempted murder of an
officer of the law is one of the charges for which they'll have to
stand trial. We'll set the trial for day after tomorrow. Meanwhile,
work on Joel Miller. If we have his signed confession, naming the
leaders of the gang, it will expedite matters a great deal at the
trial."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="vultures10" name="vultures10">X. &mdash; THE BLOOD ON
THE GOLD</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WAHPETON learned of the postponement of the trial
and reacted in various ways. The air was surcharged with tension.
Little work was done that day. Men gathering in heated,
gesticulating groups, crowded in at the bars. Voices rose in hot
altercation, fists pounded on the bars. Unfamiliar faces were
observed, men who were seldom seen in the gulch&mdash;miners from
claims in distant canyons, or more sinister figures from the hills,
whose business was less obvious.</p>

<p>Lines of cleavage were noticed. Here and there clumps of men
gathered, keeping to themselves and talking in low tones. In
certain dives the ruffian element of the camp gathered, and these
saloons were shunned by honest men. But still the great mass of the
people milled about, suspicious and uncertain. The status of too
many men was still in doubt. Certain men were known to be above
suspicion, certain others were known to be ruffians and criminals;
but between these two extremes there were possibilities for all
shades of distrust and suspicion.</p>

<p>So most men wandered aimlessly to and fro, with their weapons
ready to their hands, glancing at their fellows out of the corners
of their eyes.</p>

<p>To the surprise of all, Steve Corcoran was noticed at several
bars, drinking heavily, though the liquor did not seem to affect
him in any way.</p>

<p>The men in the jail were suffering from nerves. Somehow the word
had gotten out that the vigilante organization was a reality, and
that they were to be tried before a vigilante court. Joel Miller,
hysterical, accused Middleton of double-crossing his men.</p>

<p>"Shut up, you fool!" snarled the sheriff, showing the strain
under which he was laboring merely by the irascible edge on his
voice. "Haven't you seen your friends drifting by the jail? I've
gathered the men in from the hills. They're all here. Forty-odd
men, every Vulture in the gang, is here in Wahpeton.</p>

<p>"Now, get this: and McNab, listen closely: we'll stage the break
just before daylight, when everybody is asleep. Just before dawn is
the best time, because that's about the only time in the whole
twenty-four hours that the camp isn't going full blast.</p>

<p>"Some of the boys, with masks on, will swoop down and overpower
you deputies. There'll be no shots fired until they've gotten the
prisoners and started off. Then start yelling and shooting after
them&mdash;in the air, of course. That'll bring everybody on the
run to hear how you were overpowered by a gang of masked
riders.</p>

<p>"Miller, you and Letcher and Barlow will put up a
fight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Why, you fool, to make it look like it's a mob that's capturing
you, instead of friends rescuing you. That'll explain why none of
the deputies are hurt. Men wanting to lynch you wouldn't want to
hurt the officers. You'll yell and scream blue murder, and the men
in the masks will drag you out, tie you and throw you across horses
and ride off. Somebody is bound to see them riding away. It'll look
like a capture, not a rescue."</p>

<p>Bearded lips gaped in admiring grins at the strategy.</p>

<p>"All right. Don't make a botch of it. There'll be hell to pay,
but I'll convince Hopkins that it was the work of a mob, and we'll
search the hills to find your bodies hanging from trees. We won't
find any bodies, naturally, but maybe we'll contrive to find a mass
of ashes where a log hut had been burned to the ground, and a few
hats and belt buckles easy to identify."</p>

<p>Miller shivered at the implication and stared at Middleton with
painful intensity.</p>

<p>"Middleton, you ain't planning to have us put out of the way?
These men in masks are our friends, not vigilantes you've put up to
this?"</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool!" flared Middleton disgustedly. "Do you think
the gang would stand for anything like that, even if I was imbecile
enough to try it? You'll recognize your friends when they come.</p>

<p>"Miller, I want your name at the foot of a confession I've drawn
up, implicating somebody as the leader of the Vultures. There's no
use trying to deny you and the others are members of the gang.
Hopkins knows you are; instead of trying to play innocent, you'll
divert suspicion to someone outside the gang. I haven't filled in
the name of the leader, but Dick Lennox is as good as anybody. He's
a gambler, has few friends, and never would work with us. I'll
write his name in your 'confession' as chief of the Vultures, and
Corcoran will kill him 'for resisting arrest,' before he has time
to prove that it's a lie. Then, before anybody has time to get
suspicious, we'll make our last big haul&mdash;the raid on the
Hopkins and Bisley cache!&mdash;and blow! Be ready to jump, when
the gang swoops in.</p>

<p>"Miller, put your signature to this paper. Read it first if you
want to. I'll fill in the blanks I left for the 'chief's' name
later. Where's Corcoran?"</p>

<p>"I saw him in the Golden Eagle an hour ago," growled McNab.
"He's drinkin' like a fish."</p>

<p>"Damnation!" Middleton's mask slipped a bit despite himself,
then he regained his easy control. "Well, it doesn't matter. We
won't need him tonight. Better for him not to be here when the jail
break's made. Folks would think it was funny if he didn't kill
somebody. I'll drop back later in the night."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Even a man of steel nerves feels the strain of waiting for a
crisis. Corcoran was in this case no exception. Middleton's mind
was so occupied in planning, scheming and conniving that he had
little time for the strain to corrode his willpower. But Corcoran
had nothing to occupy his attention until the moment came for the
jump.</p>

<p>He began to drink, almost without realizing it. His veins seemed
on fire, his external senses abnormally alert. Like most men of his
breed he was high-strung, his nervous system poised on a
hair-trigger balance, in spite of his mask of unemotional coolness.
He lived on, and for, violent action. Action kept his mind from
turning inward; it kept his brain clear and his hand steady;
failing action, he fell back on whisky. Liquor artificially
stimulated him to that pitch which his temperament required. It was
not fear that made his nerves thrum so intolerably. It was the
strain of waiting inertly, the realization of the stakes for which
they played. Inaction maddened him. Thought of the gold cached in
the cave behind John Middleton's cabin made Corcoran's lips dry,
set a nerve to pounding maddeningly in his temples.</p>

<p>So he drank, and drank, and drank again, as the long day wore
on.</p>

<p>The noise from the bar was a blurred medley in the back room of
the Golden Garter. Glory Bland stared uneasily across the table at
her companion. Corcoran's blue eyes seemed lit by dancing fires.
Tiny beads of perspiration shone on his dark face. His tongue was
not thick; he spoke lucidly and without exaggeration; he had not
stumbled when he entered. Nevertheless he was drunk, though to what
extent the girl did not guess.</p>

<p>"I never saw you this way before, Steve," she said
reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I've never had a hand in a game like this before," he answered,
the wild flame flickering bluely in his eyes. He reached across the
table and caught her white wrist with an unconscious strength that
made her wince. "Glory, I'm pullin' out of here tonight. I want you
to go with me!"</p>

<p>"You're leaving Wahpeton? <i>Tonight</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes. For good. Go with me! This joint ain't fit for you. I
don't know how you got into this game, and I don't give a damn. But
you're different from these other dance hall girls. I'm takin' you
with me. I'll make a queen out of you! I'll cover you with
diamonds!"</p>

<p>She laughed nervously.</p>

<p>"You're drunker than I thought. I know you've been getting a big
salary, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Salary?" His laugh of contempt startled her. "I'll throw my
salary into the street for the beggars to fight over. Once I told
that fool Hopkins that I had a gold mine right here in Wahpeton. I
told him no lie. I'm <i>rich</i>!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" She was slightly pale, frightened by his
vehemence.</p>

<p>His fingers unconsciously tightened on her wrist and his eyes
gleamed with the hard arrogance of possession and desire.</p>

<p>"You're mine, anyway," he muttered. "I'll kill any man that
looks at you. But you're in love with me. I know it. Any fool could
see it. I can trust you. You wouldn't dare betray me. I'll tell
you. I wouldn't take you along without tellin' you the truth.
Tonight Middleton and I are goin' over the mountains with a million
dollars' worth of gold tied on pack mules!"</p>

<p>He did not see the growing light of incredulous horror in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"A million in gold! It'd make a devil out of a saint! Middleton
thinks he'll kill me when we get away safe, and grab the whole
load. He's a fool. It'll be him that dies, when the time comes.
I've planned while he planned. I didn't ever intend to split the
loot with him. I wouldn't be a thief for less than a million."</p>

<p>"Middleton&mdash;" she choked.</p>

<p>"Yeah! He's chief of the Vultures, and I'm his right-hand man.
If it hadn't been for me, the camp would have caught on long
ago."</p>

<p>"But you upheld the law," she panted, as if clutching at straws.
"You killed murderers&mdash;saved McBride from the mob."</p>

<p>"I killed men who tried to kill me. I shot as square with the
camp as I could, without goin' against my own interests. That
business of McBride has nothin' to do with it. I'd given him my
word. That's all behind us now. Tonight, while the vigilantes and
the Vultures kill each other, we'll <i>vamose</i>! And you'll go
with me!"</p>

<p>With a cry of loathing she wrenched her hand away, and sprang
up, her eyes blazing.</p>

<p>"Oh!" It was a cry of bitter disillusionment. "I thought you
were straight&mdash;honest! I worshiped you because I thought you
were honorable. So many men were dishonest and bestial&mdash;I
idolized you! And you've just been pretending&mdash;playing a part!
Betraying the people who trusted you!" The poignant anguish of her
enlightenment choked her, then galvanized her with another
possibility.</p>

<p>"I suppose you've been pretending with me, too!" she cried
wildly. "If you haven't been straight with the camp, you couldn't
have been straight with me, either! You've made a fool of me!
Laughed at me and shamed me! And now you boast of it in my
teeth!"</p>

<p>"Glory!" He was on his feet, groping for her, stunned and
bewildered by her grief and rage. She sprang back from him.</p>

<p>"Don't touch me! Don't look at me! Oh, I hate the very sight of
you!"</p>

<p>And turning, with an hysterical sob, she ran from the room. He
stood swaying slightly, staring stupidly after her. Then fumbling
with his hat, he stalked out, moving like an automaton. His
thoughts were a confused maelstrom, whirling until he was giddy.
All at once the liquor seethed madly in his brain, dulling his
perceptions, even his recollections of what had just passed. He had
drunk more than he realized.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Not long after dark had settled over Wahpeton, a low call from
the darkness brought Colonel Hopkins to the door of his cabin, gun
in hand.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" he demanded suspiciously.</p>

<p>"It's Middleton. Let me in, quick!"</p>

<p>The sheriff entered, and Hopkins, shutting the door, stared at
him in surprise. Middleton showed more agitation than the Colonel
had ever seen him display. His face was pale and drawn. A great
actor was lost to the world when John Middleton took the dark road
of outlawry.</p>

<p>"Colonel, I don't know what to say. I've been a blind fool. I
feel that the lives of murdered men are hung about my neck for all
Eternity! All through my blindness and stupidity!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, John?" ejaculated Colonel Hopkins.</p>

<p>"Colonel, Miller talked at last. He just finished telling me the
whole dirty business. I have his confession, written as he
dictated."</p>

<p>"He named the chief of the Vultures?" exclaimed Hopkins
eagerly.</p>

<p>"He did!" answered Middleton grimly, producing a paper and
unfolding it. Joel Miller's unmistakable signature sprawled at the
bottom. "Here is the name of the leader, dictated by Miller to
me!"</p>

<p>"Good God!" whispered Hopkins. "Bill McNab!"</p>

<p>"Yes! My deputy! The man I trusted next to Corcoran. What a
fool&mdash; what a blind fool I've been. Even when his actions
seemed peculiar, even when you voiced your suspicions of him, I
could not bring myself to believe it. But it's all clear now. No
wonder the gang always knew my plans as soon as I knew them myself!
No wonder my deputies&mdash;before Corcoran came&mdash;were never
able to kill or capture any Vultures. No wonder, for instance, that
Tom Deal 'escaped,' before we could question him. That bullet hole
in McNab's arm, supposedly made by Deal&mdash;Miller told me McNab
got that in a quarrel with one of his own gang. It came in handy to
help pull the wool over my eyes.</p>

<p>"Colonel Hopkins, I'll turn in my resignation tomorrow. I
recommend Corcoran as my successor. I shall be glad to serve as
deputy under him."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, John!" Hopkins laid his hand sympathetically on
Middleton's shoulder. "It's not your fault. You've played a man's
part all the way through. Forget that talk about resigning.
Wahpeton doesn't need a new sheriff; you just need some new
deputies. Just now we've got some planning to do. Where is
McNab?"</p>

<p>"At the jail, guarding the prisoners. I couldn't remove him
without exciting his suspicion. Of course he doesn't dream that
Miller has talked. And I learned something else. They plan a
jailbreak shortly after midnight."</p>

<p>"We might have expected that!"</p>

<p>"Yes. A band of masked men will approach the jail, pretend to
overpower the guards&mdash;yes, Stark and Richardson are Vultures,
too&mdash;and release the prisoners. Now this is my plan. Take
fifty men and conceal them in the trees near the jail. You can
plant some on one side, some on the other. Corcoran and I will be
with you, of course. When the bandits come, we can kill or capture
them all at one swoop. We have the advantage of knowing their
plans, without their knowing we know them."</p>

<p>"That's a good plan, John!" warmly endorsed Hopkins. "You should
have been a general. I'll gather the men at once. Of course, we
must use the utmost secrecy."</p>

<p>"Of course. If we work it right, we'll bag prisoners, deputies
and rescuers with one stroke. We'll break the back of the
Vultures!"</p>

<p>"John, don't ever talk resignation to me again!" exclaimed
Hopkins, grabbing his hat and buckling on his gun-belt. "A man like
you ought to be in the Senate. Go get Corcoran. I'll gather my men
and we'll be in our places before midnight. McNab and the others in
the jail won't hear a sound."</p>

<p>"Good! Corcoran and I will join you before the Vultures reach
the jail."</p>

<p>Leaving Hopkins' cabin, Middleton hurried to the bar of the King
of Diamonds. As he drank, a rough-looking individual moved casually
up beside him. Middleton bent his head over his whisky glass and
spoke, hardly moving his lips. None could have heard him a yard
away.</p>

<p>"I've just talked to Hopkins. The vigilantes are afraid of a
jail break. They're going to take the prisoners out just before
daylight and hang them out of hand. That talk about legal
proceedings was just a bluff. Get all the boys, go to the jail and
get the prisoners out within a half-hour after midnight. Wear your
masks, but let there be no shooting or yelling. I'll tell McNab our
plan's been changed. Go silently. Leave your horses at least a
quarter of a mile down the gulch and sneak up to the jail on foot,
so you won't make so much noise. Corcoran and I will be hiding in
the brush to give you a hand in case anything goes wrong."</p>

<p>The other man had not looked toward Middleton; he did not look
now. Emptying his glass, he strolled deliberately toward the door.
No casual onlooker could have known that any words had passed
between them.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>When Glory Bland ran from the backroom of the Golden Garter, her
soul was in an emotional turmoil that almost amounted to insanity.
The shock of her brutal disillusionment vied with passionate shame
of her own gullibility and an unreasoning anger. Out of this
seething cauldron grew a blind desire to hurt the man who had
unwittingly hurt her. Smarting vanity had its part, too, for with
characteristic and illogical feminine conceit, she believed that he
had practiced an elaborate deception in order to fool her into
falling in love with him&mdash;or rather with the man she thought
he was. If he was false with men, he must be false with women, too.
That thought sent her into hysterical fury, blind to all except a
desire for revenge. She was a primitive, elemental young animal,
like most of her profession of that age and place; her emotions
were powerful and easily stirred, her passions stormy. Love could
change quickly to hate.</p>

<p>She reached an instant decision. She would find Hopkins and tell
him everything Corcoran had told her! In that instant she desired
nothing so much as the ruin of the man she had loved.</p>

<p>She ran down the crowded street, ignoring men who pawed at her
and called after her. She hardly saw the people who stared after
her. She supposed that Hopkins would be at the jail, helping guard
the prisoners, and she directed her steps thither. As she ran up on
the porch Bill McNab confronted her with a leer, and laid a hand on
her arm, laughing when she jerked away.</p>

<p>"Come to see me, Glory? Or are you lookin' for Corcoran?"</p>

<p>She struck his hand away. His words, and the insinuating guffaws
of his companions were sparks enough to touch off the explosives
seething in her.</p>

<p>"You fool! You're being sold out, and don't know it!"</p>

<p>The leer vanished.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he snarled.</p>

<p>"I mean that your boss is fixing to skip out with all the gold
you thieves have grabbed!" she blurted, heedless of consequences,
in her emotional storm, indeed scarcely aware of what she was
saying. "He and Corcoran are going to leave you holding the sack,
tonight!"</p>

<p>And not seeing the man she was looking for, she eluded McNab's
grasp, jumped down from the porch and darted away in the
darkness.</p>

<p>The deputies stared at each other, and the prisoners, having
heard everything, began to clamor to be turned out.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" snarled McNab. "She may be lyin'. Might have had a
quarrel with Corcoran and took this fool way to get even with him.
We can't afford to take no chances. We've got to be sure we know
what we're doin' before we move either way. We can't afford to let
you out now, on the chance that she might be lyin'. But we'll give
you weapons to defend yourselves.</p>

<p>"Here, take these rifles and hide 'em under the bunks. Pete
Daley, you stay here and keep folks shooed away from the jail till
we get back. Richardson, you and Stark come with me! We'll have a
showdown with Middleton right now!"</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>When Glory left the jail she headed for Hopkins' cabin. But she
had not gone far when a reaction shook her. She was like one waking
from a nightmare, or a dope-jag. She was still sickened by the
discovery of Corcoran's duplicity in regard to the people of the
camp, but she began to apply reason to her suspicions of his
motives in regard to herself. She began to realize that she had
acted illogically. If Corcoran's attitude toward her was not
sincere, he certainly would not have asked her to leave the camp
with him. At the expense of her vanity she was forced to admit that
his attentions to her had not been necessary in his game of duping
the camp. That was something apart; his own private business; it
must be so. She had suspected him of trifling with her affections,
but she had to admit that she had no proof that he had ever paid
the slightest attention to any other woman in Wahpeton. No;
whatever his motives or actions in general, his feeling toward her
must be sincere and real.</p>

<p>With a shock she remembered her present errand, her reckless
words to McNab. Despair seized her, in which she realized that she
loved Steve Corcoran in spite of all he might be. Chill fear seized
her that McNab and his friends would kill her lover. Her
unreasoning fury died out, gave way to frantic terror.</p>

<p>Turning she ran swiftly down the gulch toward Corcoran's cabin.
She was hardly aware of it when she passed through the blazing
heart of the camp. Lights and bearded faces were like a nightmarish
blur, in which nothing was real but the icy terror in her
heart.</p>

<p>She did not realize it when the clusters of cabins fell behind
her. The patter of her slippered feet in the road terrified her,
and the black shadows under the trees seemed pregnant with menace.
Ahead of her she saw Corcoran's cabin at last, a light streaming
through the open door. She burst into the office-room,
panting&mdash;and was confronted by Middleton who wheeled with a
gun in his hand.</p>

<p>"What the devil are you doing here?" He spoke without
friendliness, though he returned the gun to its scabbard.</p>

<p>"Where's Corcoran?" she panted. Fear took hold of her as she
faced the man she now knew was the monster behind the grisly crimes
that had made a reign of terror over Wahpeton Gulch. But fear for
Corcoran overshadowed her own terror.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I looked for him through the bars a short time
ago, and didn't find him. I'm expecting him here any minute. What
do you want with him?"</p>

<p>"That's none of your business," she flared.</p>

<p>"It might be." He came toward her, and the mask had fallen from
his dark, handsome face. It looked wolfish.</p>

<p>"You were a fool to come here. You pry into things that don't
concern you. You know too much. You talk too much. Don't think I'm
not wise to you! I know more about you than you suspect."</p>

<p>A chill fear froze her. Her heart seemed to be turning to ice.
Middleton was like a stranger to her, a terrible stranger. The mask
was off, and the evil spirit of the man was reflected in his dark,
sinister face. His eyes burned her like actual coals.</p>

<p>"I didn't pry into secrets," she whispered with dry lips. "I
didn't ask any questions. I never before suspected you were the
chief of the Vultures&mdash;"</p>

<p>The expression of his face told her she had made an awful
mistake.</p>

<p>"So you know that!" His voice was soft, almost a whisper, but
murder stood stark and naked in his flaming eyes. "I didn't know
that. I was talking about something else. Conchita told me it was
you who told Corcoran about the plan to lynch McBride. I wouldn't
have killed you for that, though it interfered with my plans. But
you know too much. After tonight it wouldn't matter. But tonight's
not over yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" she moaned, staring with dilated eyes as the big pistol
slid from its scabbard in a dull gleam of blue steel. She could not
move, she could not cry out. She could only cower dumbly until the
crash of the shot knocked her to the floor.</p>

<p>As Middleton stood above her, the smoking gun in his hand, he
heard a stirring in the room behind him. He quickly upset the long
table, so it could hide the body of the girl, and turned, just as
the door opened. Corcoran came from the back room, blinking, a gun
in his hand. It was evident that he had just awakened from a
drunken sleep, but his hands did not shake, his pantherish tread
was sure as ever, and his eyes were neither dull nor bloodshot.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Middleton swore.</p>

<p>"Corcoran, are you crazy?"</p>

<p>"You shot?"</p>

<p>"I shot at a snake that crawled across the floor. You must have
been mad, to soak up liquor today, of all days!"</p>

<p>"I'm all right," muttered Corcoran, shoving his gun back in its
scabbard.</p>

<p>"Well, come on. I've got the mules in the clump of trees next to
my cabin. Nobody will see us load them. Nobody will see us go.
We'll go up the ravine beyond my cabin, as we planned. There's
nobody watching my cabin tonight. All the Vultures are down in the
camp, waiting for the signal to move. I'm hoping none will escape
the vigilantes, and that most of the vigilantes themselves are
killed in the fight that's sure to come. Come on! We've got thirty
mules to load, and that job will take us from now until midnight,
at least. We won't pull out until we hear the guns on the other
side of the camp."</p>

<p>"Listen!"</p>

<p>It was footsteps, approaching the cabin almost at a run. Both
men wheeled and stood motionless as McNab loomed in the door. He
lurched into the room, followed by Richardson and Stark. Instantly
the air was supercharged with suspicion, hate, tension. Silence
held for a tick of time.</p>

<p>"You fools!" snarled Middleton. "What are you doing away from
the jail?"</p>

<p>"We came to talk to you," said McNab. "We've heard that you and
Corcoran planned to skip with the gold."</p>

<p>Never was Middleton's superb self-control more evident. Though
the shock of that blunt thunderbolt must have been terrific, he
showed no emotion that might not have been showed by any honest
man, falsely accused.</p>

<p>"Are you utterly mad?" he ejaculated, not in a rage, but as if
amazement had submerged whatever anger he might have felt at the
charge.</p>

<p>McNab shifted his great bulk uneasily, not sure of his ground.
Corcoran was not looking at him, but at Richardson, in whose cold
eyes a lethal glitter was growing. More quickly than Middleton,
Corcoran sensed the inevitable struggle in which this situation
must culminate.</p>

<p>"I'm just sayin' what we heard. Maybe it's so, maybe it ain't.
If it ain't, there's no harm done," said McNab slowly. "On the
chance that it was so, I sent word for the boys not to wait till
midnight. They're goin' to the jail within the next half-hour and
take Miller and the rest out."</p>

<p>Another breathless silence followed that statement. Middleton
did not bother to reply. His eyes began to smolder. Without moving,
he yet seemed to crouch, to gather himself for a spring. He had
realized what Corcoran had already sensed; that this situation was
not to be passed over by words, that a climax of violence was
inevitable.</p>

<p>Richardson knew this; Stark seemed merely puzzled. McNab, if he
had any thoughts, concealed the fact.</p>

<p>"Say you <i>was</i> intendin' to skip," he said, "this might be
a good chance, while the boys was takin' Miller and them off up
into the hills. I don't know. I ain't accusin' you. I'm just askin'
you to clear yourself. You can do it easy. Just come back to the
jail with us and help get the boys out."</p>

<p>Middleton's answer was what Richardson, instinctive man-killer,
had sensed it would be. He whipped out a gun in a blur of speed.
And even as it cleared leather, Richardson's gun was out. But
Corcoran had not taken his eyes off the cold-eyed gunman, and his
draw was the quicker by a lightning-flicker. Quick as was
Middleton, both the other guns spoke before his, like a double
detonation. Corcoran's slug blasted Richardson's brains just in
time to spoil his shot at Middleton. But the bullet grazed
Middleton so close that it caused him to miss McNab with his first
shot.</p>

<p>McNab's gun was out and Stark was a split second behind him.
Middleton's second shot and McNab's first crashed almost together,
but already Corcoran's guns had sent lead ripping through the
giant's flesh. His ball merely flicked Middleton's hair in passing,
and the chief's slug smashed full into his brawny breast. Middleton
fired again and yet again as the giant was falling. Stark was down,
dying on the floor, having pulled trigger blindly as he fell, until
the gun was empty.</p>

<p>Middleton stared wildly about him, through the floating blue fog
of smoke that veiled the room. In that fleeting instant, as he
glimpsed Corcoran's image-like face, he felt that only in such a
setting as this did the Texan appear fitted. Like a somber figure
of Fate he moved implacably against a background of blood and
slaughter.</p>

<p>"God!" gasped Middleton. "That was the quickest, bloodiest fight
I was ever in!" Even as he talked he was jamming cartridges into
his empty gun chambers.</p>

<p>"We've got no time to lose now! I don't know how much McNab told
the gang of his suspicions. He must not have told them much, or
some of them would have come with him. Anyway, their first move
will be to liberate the prisoners. I have an idea they'll go
through with that just as we planned, even when McNab doesn't
return to lead them. They won't come looking for him, or come after
us, until they turn Miller and the others loose.</p>

<p>"It just means the fight will come within the half-hour instead
of at midnight. The vigilantes will be there by that time. They're
probably lying in ambush already. Come on! We've got to sling gold
on those mules like devils. We may have to leave some of it; we'll
know when the fight's started, by the sound of the guns! One thing,
nobody will come up here to investigate the shooting. All attention
is focused on the jail!"</p>

<p>Corcoran followed him out of the cabin, then turned back with a
muttered: "Left a bottle of whisky in that back room."</p>

<p>"Well, hurry and get it and come on!" Middleton broke into a run
toward his cabin, and Corcoran re-entered the smoke-veiled room. He
did not glance at the crumpled bodies which lay on the
crimson-stained floor, staring glassily up at him. With a stride he
reached the back room, groped in his bunk until he found what he
wanted, and then strode again toward the outer door, the bottle in
his hand.</p>

<p>The sound of a low moan brought him whirling about, a gun in his
left hand. Startled, he stared at the figures on the floor. He knew
none of them had moaned; all three were past moaning. Yet his ears
had not deceived him.</p>

<p>His narrowed eyes swept the cabin suspiciously, and focused on a
thin trickle of crimson that stole from under the upset table as it
lay on its side near the wall. None of the corpses lay near it.</p>

<p>He pulled aside the table and halted as if shot through the
heart, his breath catching in a convulsive gasp. An instant later
he was kneeling beside Glory Bland, cradling her golden head in his
arm. His hand, as he brought the whisky bottle to her lips, shook
queerly.</p>

<p>Her magnificent eyes lifted toward him, glazed with pain. But by
some miracle the delirium faded, and she knew him in her last few
moments of life.</p>

<p>"Who did this?" he choked. Her white throat was laced by a tiny
trickle of crimson from her lips.</p>

<p>"Middleton&mdash;" she whispered. "Steve, oh, Steve&mdash;I
tried&mdash;" And with the whisper uncompleted she went limp in his
arms. Her golden head lolled back; she seemed like a child, a child
just fallen asleep. Dazedly he eased her to the floor.</p>

<p>Corcoran's brain was clear of liquor as he left the cabin, but
he staggered like a drunken man. The monstrous, incredible thing
that had happened left him stunned, hardly able to credit his own
senses. It had never occurred to him that Middleton would kill a
woman, that any white man would. Corcoran lived by his own code,
and it was wild and rough and hard, violent and incongruous, but it
included the conviction that womankind was sacred, immune from the
violence that attended the lives of men. This code was as much a
vital, living element of the life of the Southwestern frontier as
was personal honor, and the resentment of insult. Without
pompousness, without pretentiousness, without any of the tawdry
glitter and sham of a false chivalry, the people of Corcoran's
breed practiced this code in their daily lives. To Corcoran, as to
his people, a woman's life and body were inviolate. It had never
occurred to him that that code would, or could be violated, or that
there could be any other kind.</p>

<p>Cold rage swept the daze from his mind and left him crammed to
the brim with murder. His feelings toward Glory Bland had
approached the normal love experienced by the average man as
closely as was possible for one of his iron nature. But if she had
been a stranger, or even a person he had disliked, he would have
killed Middleton for outraging a code he had considered
absolute.</p>

<p>He entered Middleton's cabin with the soft stride of a stalking
panther. Middleton was bringing bulging buckskin sacks from the
cave, heaping them on a table in the main room. He staggered with
their weight. Already the table was almost covered.</p>

<p>"Get busy!" he exclaimed. Then he halted short, at the blaze in
Corcoran's eyes. The fat sacks spilled from his arms, thudding on
the floor.</p>

<p>"You killed Glory Bland!" It was almost a whisper from the
Texan's livid lips.</p>

<p>"Yes." Middleton's voice was even. He did not ask how Corcoran
knew, he did not seek to justify himself. He knew the time for
argument was past. He did not think of his plans, or of the gold on
the table, or that still back there in the cave. A man standing
face to face with Eternity sees only the naked elements of life and
death.</p>

<p><i>"Draw!"</i> A catamount might have spat the challenge, eyes
flaming, teeth flashing.</p>

<p>Middleton's hand was a streak to his gun butt. Even in that
flash he knew he was beaten&mdash;heard Corcoran's gun roar just as
he pulled trigger. He swayed back, falling, and in a blind gust of
passion Corcoran emptied both guns into him as he crumpled.</p>

<p>For a long moment that seemed ticking into Eternity the killer
stood over his victim, a somber, brooding figure that might have
been carved from the iron night of the Fates. Off toward the other
end of the camp other guns burst forth suddenly, in salvo after
thundering salvo. The fight that was plotted to mask the flight of
the Vulture chief had begun. But the figure which stood above the
dead man in the lonely cabin did not seem to hear.</p>

<p>Corcoran looked down at his victim, vaguely finding it strange,
after all, that all those bloody schemes and terrible ambitions
should end like that, in a puddle of oozing blood on a cabin floor.
He lifted his head to stare somberly at the bulging sacks on the
table. Revulsion gagged him.</p>

<p>A sack had split, spilling a golden stream that glittered evilly
in the candlelight. His eyes were no longer blinded by the yellow
sheen. For the first time he saw the blood on that gold, it was
black with blood; the blood of innocent men; the blood of a woman.
The mere thought of touching it nauseated him, made him feel as if
the slime that had covered John Middleton's soul would befoul him.
Sickly he realized that some of Middleton's guilt was on his own
head. He had not pulled the trigger that ripped a woman's life from
her body; but he had worked hand-in-glove with the man destined to
be her murderer&mdash;Corcoran shuddered and a clammy sweat broke
out upon his flesh.</p>

<p>Down the gulch the firing had ceased, faint yells came to him,
freighted with victory and triumph. Many men must be shouting at
once, for the sound to carry so far. He knew what it portended; the
Vultures had walked into the trap laid for them by the man they
trusted as a leader. Since the firing had ceased, it meant the
whole band were either dead or captives. Wahpeton's reign of terror
had ended.</p>

<h3><a id="end1" name="end1"></a>FIRST ENDING</h3>

<p>But he must stir. There would be prisoners, eager to talk. Their
speech would weave a noose about his neck.</p>

<p>He did not glance again at the gold, gleaming there where the
honest people of Wahpeton would find it. Striding from the cabin he
swung on one of the horses that stood saddled and ready among the
trees. The lights of the camp, the roar of the distant voices fell
away behind him, and before him lay what wild destiny he could not
guess. But the night was full of haunting shadows, and within him
grew a strange pain, like a revelation; perhaps it was his soul, at
last awakening.</p>

<h3><a id="end2" name="end2"></a>SECOND ENDING</h3>

<p>But he must stir. There would be prisoners, eager to talk. Their
speech would weave a noose about his neck. The men of Wahpeton must
not find him here when they came.</p>

<p>But before he turned his back forever upon Wahpeton Gulch, he
had a task to perform. He did not glance again at the gold,
gleaming there where the honest people of the camp would find it.
Two horses waited, bridled and saddled, among the restless mules
tethered under the trees. One was the animal which had borne him
into Wahpeton. He mounted it and rode slowly toward the cabin where
a woman lay beside dead men. He felt vaguely that it was not right
to leave her lying there among those shot-torn rogues.</p>

<p>He braced himself against the sight as he entered the cabin of
death. Then he started and went livid under his sun-burnt hue.
Glory was not lying as he had left her! With a low cry he reached
her, lifted her in his arms. He felt life, pulsing strongly under
his hands.</p>

<p>"Glory! For God's sake!" Her eyes were open, not so glazed now,
though shadowed by pain and bewilderment. Her arms groped toward
him. He lifted and carried her into the back room, laid her on the
bunk where Joe Willoughby had received his death wounds. His mind
was a whirling turmoil, as he felt with practised fingers of the
darkly-clotted wound at the edge of her golden hair.</p>

<p>"Steve," she whimpered. "I'm afraid! Middleton&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He won't hurt you any more. Don't talk. I'm goin' to wash that
wound and dress it."</p>

<p>Working fast and skillfully, he washed the blood away with a rag
torn from her petticoat&mdash;as being the cleanest material he
could find&mdash;and soaked in water and whisky. Corcoran had just
ceased bandaging her head when she struggled upright, despite his
profane objections, and caught at his arm.</p>

<p>"Steve!" Her eyes were wide with fear. "You must go&mdash;go
quick! I was crazy&mdash;I told McNab what you told me&mdash;told
Middleton, too, that's why he shot me. They'll kill you."</p>

<p>"Not them," he muttered. "Do you feel better now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't mind me! Go! Please go! Oh, Steve, I must have been
mad! I betrayed you! I was coming here to tell you that I had, to
warn you to get away, when I met Middleton. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"In Hell, where he ought to been years ago," grunted Corcoran.
"Never mind. But the vigilantes will be headin' this way soon as
some of the rats they've caught get to talkin'. I've got to dust
out. But I'll take you back to the Golden Garter first."</p>

<p>"Steve, you're mad! You'd run your head into a noose! Get on
your horse and ride!"</p>

<p>"Will you go with me?" His hands closed on her, hurting her with
their unconscious strength.</p>

<p>"You still want me, after&mdash;after what I did?" she
gasped.</p>

<p>"I've always wanted you, since I first saw you. I always will.
Forgive you? There's nothin' to forgive. Nothin' you could have
ever done could be anywhere near as black as what I've been for the
past month. I've been like a mad-dog; the gold blinded me. I'm
awake now. And I want you."</p>

<p>For answer her arms groped about his neck, clung convulsively;
he felt the moisture of her passionate tears on his throat. Lifting
her, he carried her out of the cabin, pressing her face against his
breast that she might not see the stark figures lying there in
their splashes of crimson.</p>

<p>An instant later he was settled in the saddle, holding her
before him, cradled like a child in his muscular arms. He had
wrapped his coat about her, and the pale oval of her face stared up
at his like a white blossom in the night. Her arms still clung to
him, as if she feared he might be torn from her.</p>

<p>"How the lights blaze over the camp!" she murmured irrelevantly,
as they climbed toward the ravine.</p>

<p>"Take a good look," he said, his voice harsh with suppressed and
unfamiliar emotions. "It's our old life we're leavin' behind, and I
hope we're headin' for a better one. And as a beginnin', we're
goin' to get married the first town we hit."</p>

<p>An incoherent murmur was her only reply as she snuggled closer
in his arms; behind them the lights of the camp, the distant roar
of voices fell away and grew blurred in the distance. But it seemed
to Corcoran that they rode in a blaze of glory, that emanated not
from moon nor stars, but from his own breast. And perhaps it was
his soul, at last awakened.</p>
