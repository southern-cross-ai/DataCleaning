<h2><a id="note" name="note">PRELIMINARY NOTE</a>
</h2>

<p class="note">Every person, place and thing in this
story&mdash;even the countries in which it happens&mdash;are
fictitious, and any resemblance, though it runs to the pitch of
identical names and circumstances, is at most a realistic device
and free of any libellous intention whatever. It is an imagination
about everyone and nobody, about everyland and nowhere, justified
by the Lives of Suetonius and our present discontents. Maybe it is
life-like, that is the incurable ambition of the novelist, he will
not disavow it; but if so it is because its characters have come
alive. Their motives run about in our world also, and it is our
problems with which they wrestle in their distinct and perhaps
simpler but similar world. The England, the America, the London in
this book are not the England, America and London of geography and
journalism, but England, America and London transposed into
imaginative narrative. The tampering of J.W. Dunne with popular
ideas of space and time is having its influence upon fiction. So
far as the writer may judge his own story, it seems to begin on
earth somewhere in the nineteen-twenties, but it goes on and on
unrestrainedly, into the years to come. The writer has let that
happen, he calls your attention to it to prepare your mind for it,
but he offers no explanation or apology.</p>

<h2><a id="book1" name="book1">BOOK I. &mdash; INCUBATION</a>
</h2>

<h2>I. &mdash; TENDER YEARS</h2>

<h3>&sect; I</h3>

<p class="first">"It's a Holy Terror," said Betsy Barnacle, the
monthly nurse. "I never heard such a baby. Scream and scream it
does. <i>And</i> its little fists!"</p>

<p>"There ain't nothing <i>wrong</i> with it?" asked cook.</p>

<p>"Only it's a little Turk," said Betsy. "Goes stiff it does and
if you tried to stop it, there'd be convulsions. Hark at it now!
You'd think it would rupture itself."</p>

<p>The two women listened judicially. Their eyes met in a common
wonder.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have thought its father had it in him," said
cook.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; II</h3>

<p class="first">The baby grew into an incessantly active, bilious
little boy with a large white face, a slight scowl and the devil of
a temper. He was a natural born kicker; he went straight for the
shins. He was also a wrist-twister, but he bit very little. On the
other hand he was a great smasher of the cherished possessions of
those who annoyed him, and particularly the possessions of his
brothers Samuel and Alf. He seemed to have been born with the idea
of "serving people out." He wept very little, but when he wept he
howled aloud, and jabbered wild abuse, threats and recriminations
through the wet torrent of his howling. The neighbours heard him.
Old gentlemen stopped and turned round to look at him in the
street.</p>

<p>By the time he was seven or eight quite a number of people had
asked: "What can you <i>do</i> with a boy like that?" Nobody had
found a satisfactory solution to the problem. Many suggestions were
made, from "Knock his little block off," to "Give him more
love."</p>

<p>Nowadays many people deny that the unpleasantness of unpleasant
children comes naturally. They say they are love-starved. His Aunt
Julia, for example, did. "You think so," said his mother, and did
not argue about it, because at times she was very doubtful indeed
whether she did love him. She was for a mother unusually
clear-headed. She was affectionate but she was critical. And what
to <i>do</i> with him she did not know.</p>

<p>His name was Rudolf, not perhaps the wisest name to give a
child, which shortened naturally into Rudie, but which after he had
heard of the existence and world-wide fame of Mr. Kipling he
insisted upon shortening further and improperly&mdash;since it
altered the vowel sound&mdash;into "Rud." He was also called Young
Whitlow, Whitlow Tertius, Wittles and Drink, Wittles and Stink,
Grub and simply The Stink. He objected strenuously to the last and
always attempted the murder of anyone not too obviously an outsize
who used it. It referred to some early accident in his career which
he desired to have forgotten.</p>

<p>His relations with his brothers were strained. Samuel was
inclined to mock and tease him&mdash;a perilous joy. He threw a
dinner-knife across the table at Samuel and nicked a bit off the
top of his ear. Samuel had either taken an overdose of mustard or,
as Rud declared, twisted his nose in such a way as to imply
"Stink." The subsequent enquiry never settled this. The ear bled
copiously into Mrs. Whitlow's handkerchief and nobody could imagine
what would have happened if the knife had gone four inches
straighter. "Might have blinded me," accused Samuel, from under
Mother's arm. "Might have cut my eye clean out." It was a
tremendous scene and Mr. Whitlow, who disliked the job extremely,
took little Rudie upstairs and spanked him, calling him "You little
<i>Devil!</i>" between each smack, and left him in the bedroom.</p>

<p>Thither presently came Mother.</p>

<p>"Why did you <i>do</i> it, Rudie?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He's always teasing me. He drives me wild," said Rudie.</p>

<p>"But to throw a <i>knife!</i>"</p>

<p>"He won't do it again," said Rudie, smearing his wet, dirty,
woeful face and nose with the back of his dirty little hand. "Your
own brother!"</p>

<p>Later he threw a large, wooden toy-horse at Alf and missed him
and smashed the parlour window. "Your father will beat you again!"
cried mother in distress. "Say you were playing catch with him,
Alfie!"</p>

<p>"I didn't catch the horse," brother Alf prevaricated stoutly to
Father, and the beating was averted.</p>

<p>But little Rudie never thanked Alfred for that. He never thought
very much of Alfred.</p>

<p>He stole his brothers' things, he played with their things and
broke them and they had no remedy&mdash;for you cannot sneak on a
younger brother and they were forbidden to take the law into their
own hands. All three of the boys drew and painted. Alf's work was
the more delicate and he copied meticulously, but Rudie's had a
sort of splashing originality. When Alf took a bright and careful
bit of illumination to school the drawing master praised it in
front of the whole classroom, and he had never once had a word of
praise for Rudie's frequent and hasty performances. So Rudie got
hold of and tore up Alf's masterpiece and, when the master wanted
to exhibit it again, the story came out and Rudie was reproached by
the master before everybody. He went home with a bursting heart and
scribbled all over a number of pages in Alf's favourite book.</p>

<p>"What can you <i>do</i> with a boy like that?" asked Mr. Whitlow
in the bar parlour of the <i>Bell</i>.</p>

<p>"He's got spirit," said Mr. Cramble, the grocer.</p>

<p>"An evil spirit," said Mr. Whitlow.</p>

<p>"He'll change as he grows up," said Lozanda, the vet.
"Adolescence. They often do."</p>

<p>"If he doesn't," said Mr. Whitlow, "he'll face a jury one of
these days. I tell him that. But does he mind me? Not him."</p>

<p>"Spare the rod," hinted Mr. Cramble.</p>

<p>"His mother don't like his being touched," said Mr. Whitlow,
"and <i>I</i> don't much like it either. I suppose I'm a bit
modern."</p>

<p>"You see," said Mr. Whitlow after reflection, "he's not
over-strong. He has these headaches and bilious fits. And he seems
to be able to make himself look pale when he wants to. I used to
think his brothers would keep him in order a bit. But he kicks
them, he does, and they can't very well kick back, him being
delicate. Their mother'd never forgive them if they left a bruise
on him. All they seem able to do with him is to get him upstairs in
their bedroom and suffocate him with pillows. He certainly don't
like that. But he's got artful about it. He used to kick and try to
yell and so they knew he was all right. <i>Now</i> he goes limp
right away as soon as they've got hold of him. And naturally they
take off the pillows to look at him and see they've done him no
harm and he sort of comes-to very slowly. Last time they did it, he
got away down the passage and then went back and buzzed an old
croquet ball at young Alf and raised a lump&mdash;so big."</p>

<p>"Sort of Problem Child," said Skindles, the watch-maker.</p>

<p>"What's going to become of him?" said Whitlow and straightway
abandoned further enquiry.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; III</h3>

<p class="first">Mrs. Whitlow was a woman of some intelligence and
she had had a good modern education, which had confused her mind
considerably. Nevertheless she kept up her reading.</p>

<p>She thought that women were the race and men merely incidents,
and that every great man in the world owed nearly everything to his
mother. She thought that if Adam had had a mother things might have
been very different, and that the story of Ruth and Naomi was the
most beautiful story in the world. And she thought that after Sam
and Alf she ought to have had a daughter, and when Rudolf came
squalling into her life she repined gently.</p>

<p>Once or twice she said to him, wistfully but unwisely, "If only
you had been a dear little girl," and so sowed the seeds of an
enduring misogyny. The sex-war was all alight in him from the age
of six onward.</p>

<p>The first girl he hit was his cousin Rachel, who had
recited:</p>

<p class="poem">"Sugar and spice and all things nice<br>
That's what little girls are made of<br>
Slugs and snails and little dogs' tails<br>
And that's what little boys are made of,"</p>

<p>to him. He hit her, and all she did was to slap back&mdash;just
a stinging slap&mdash;and then he got her by her long hair.
Whereupon she pinched&mdash;so painfully it made him yell with
surprise&mdash;and then got hold of his wrists in a strong sort of
grip that immobilised him and then she put out her tongue at him.
"Yaaaa!" she said. He couldn't get free of her. Not for the moment.
Of course he would have won all right, in spite of the fact that
she was nearly a year older, but just at this point the mothers
came in.</p>

<p>Her mother completely misunderstood the situation. "Rachel!" she
cried, "what are you doing to that poor little boy?"</p>

<p>(Jimini! What <i>wasn't</i> he just going to do to
<i>her!</i>)</p>

<p>He brooded on this affair afterwards. It left an uneasiness and
an aversion. There was something queer about these girls; they were
like insects; you didn't know what they might do to you next. And
their shins were difficult to get at. They weren't as soft as they
ought to be, not nearly.</p>

<p>What properly ought he to have done? Jerked his wrists free of
course, and then?</p>

<p>"He's not a gentle child," said his mother to Rachel's mother.
"He's <i>not</i> gentle."</p>

<p>"Love him all the more," said Aunt Julia who was also
present.</p>

<p>But after one or two attempts to take him to her bosom and sit
him on her lap and reason with him gently or talk to him
beautifully about the child Jesus, about whose entirely
undocumented youth she invented the most unwarrantable stories, she
realised her sister-in-law's difficulties better. Rudie fought her
love like a wild cat.</p>

<p>They tried to soften his nature by giving him pets. But they had
to take the white mice away from him again because he wanted to
teach them to swim and submerge themselves in the bath at the word
of command and was inclined to be punitive when they failed to
realise what was expected of them. Dogs he regarded with suspicion
and had a way of picking up stones when he saw them. The suspicion
was mutual. His white rabbits died either of eccentric and
irregular dietary or by being dropped suddenly as a punishment for
squirming about and kicking in sudden disconcerting jerks. For a
time he seemed really to like a gay little kitten that pursued a
rabbit's foot on a piece of string with the most ridiculous
nimbleness and waggery. Then something happened. A great running
and banging-about upstairs was heard. The kitten came headlong down
the staircase incredibly scared. Rudie followed in
pursuit&mdash;armed with his little cricket bat.</p>

<p>"She won't play with me any longer," he bellowed. "She's
<i>got</i> to. Where's she gone?"</p>

<p>What can you do with a boy like that?</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; IV</h3>

<p class="first">Aunt Julia's earliest attempts at changing Rudie's
heart by love had not been very successful, but she was a
persistent woman and full of ideas of the most diverse sort about
the bringing up of children and the lamentable foolishness with
which people in general set about that business. People marry for
passion, a most improper motive, and their children take them by
surprise. They don't deserve them. Maybe in a more scientific world
only spinsters will have children. She knew she was on the right
track&mdash;or tracks&mdash;in disapproving of whatever had been
done, was being done or was ever likely to be done with Rudie.
Children are right, and parents and pedagogues never understand
them. That is the privilege and compensation of the observant
spinster. Very likely she had been a little precipitate with Rudie,
but she felt she should try again.</p>

<p>She had a nice long talk one evening with Mrs. Whitlow. "You
ought to have him psycho-analysed," she said. "It lies too deep for
us untrained observers. Very likely that Oedipus complex. But what
we have to remember always is that, like every child, he is
intrinsically <i>good</i>."</p>

<p>"At times," said Mrs. Whitlow, "that is very hard to
believe."</p>

<p>"I copied some bits of wisdom out of a book by Mr. Neill," said
Aunt Julia. "Listen, dear: '<i>I cannot say the truth is, but I can
declare my strong conviction that the boy is never in the
wrong.</i>' What do you think of that? And '<i>the self that God
made</i>'&mdash;isn't that beautifully put '<i>the self that God
made is in conflict with all our silly teaching and
interference.</i>' And this!&mdash;what a comfort it is in these
times of war and trouble!&mdash;'<i>Human beings are good, they
want to do good; they want to love and be loved.</i>' When one
thinks of all those poor love-starved young aviators
bombing&mdash;what was the name of that place in
India&mdash;yesterday? Just unsatisfied love-hunger. And then this
again: '<i>Criminality</i>,' he says, my dear, '<i>springs from
lack of love</i>.'"</p>

<p>"On the part of the criminal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, dear! No. <i>No!</i> NO! On the part of the people who
make the laws. And so you see what we have to do, is just to find
out the complex that is tying poor little Rudie down to all his
naughtiness. When he broke the leg of his rabbit when he was
playing with it the other day, that was really a
<i>protest</i>&mdash;a symbol."</p>

<p>"It wasn't a nice symbol for the rabbit."</p>

<p>"We have to discover his complex&mdash;that is the next
thing."</p>

<p>"He keeps so quiet about that."</p>

<p>"Naturally. We have to discover it. Now tell me&mdash;do you and
George, do you ever quarrel in front of Rudie?"</p>

<p>"My <i>dear!</i>"</p>

<p>"Does he ever see you caressing or making love?"</p>

<p>"Julia, <i>darling!</i>"</p>

<p>"Does he&mdash;is he disposed to <i>avoid</i> his father?"</p>

<p>"He keeps out of his way&mdash;especially when he is up to
mischief."</p>

<p>"A pure Oedipus," said Julia, nodding her head several times.
"Probably a chemically pure Oedipus. Now tell me: When you and he
are together and his father comes in, does he seem to want to get
close to you&mdash;edge between you, so to speak? As if to protect
you?"</p>

<p>"It's generally the other way about. He wants to be protected.
Not that his father ever ill-treats him. But the boy has that sort
of conscience. He always feels his father may have found out
something."</p>

<p>"Exactly. And now tell me&mdash;tell me&mdash;do you
think&mdash;has he any particular feeling&mdash;any sort of
aversion,"&mdash;Julia became very red in the face but her eyes
were bright and resolute&mdash;"<i>Steeples?</i>"</p>

<p>Mrs. Whitlow thought. "He certainly hates going to church for
the children's service," she said. "If you mean that."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Transfers it to the church&mdash;where dear Mr.
Woolley presides. And no doubt to Mr. Woolley. The Oedipus in
perfection. The radiating father-hate. But don't trust my untrained
judgment, dear. Go to a proper psycho-analyst and have all this
cleared up. Then you will know..."</p>

<p>Thus Aunt Julia.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Whitlow did not go to a psycho-analyst. She had seen
only one or two in her life and she had not liked the look of them.
But the idea of getting some advice took hold of her and she
decided to go to old Doctor Carstall, who was so big and deliberate
that you felt you could put the utmost confidence in him. And by
making an excuse of Rudie's bilious attacks, old Doctor Carstall
looked him over.</p>

<p>"He's the most ordinary boy I ever met," said old Doctor
Carstall, "except that he has a certain excess of&mdash;<i>go</i>
in him, and a lack of self-restraint. He's fairly intelligent of
course&mdash;in his way."</p>

<p>"He's not an <i>ordinary</i> boy," said Mrs. Whitlow, defending
every mother's dearest illusion, "not by any means."</p>

<p>"As you will," said old Doctor Carstall. "But keep him out of
the hands of these faddists and send him to the most conventional
school you can find. He'll probably do as well as most ordinary
little boys&mdash;get scholarships, play games and all that. He
has&mdash;well&mdash;<i>tenacity</i>. He doesn't feel scruples if
he wants anything. Don't imagine he's anything out of the way for
naughtiness. It's just that that curious <i>go</i> of his brings it
out..."</p>

<p>"Nasty little kid," soliloquised old Doctor Carstall, when Mrs.
Whitlow had departed. "There's millions like him&mdash;more or
less.</p>

<p>"Millions," he repeated. "Most people forget what nasty children
they were themselves. They forget it.</p>

<p>"Just because children are small and pink&mdash;or small and
sickly like this little beast&mdash;they imagine them angelic. If
you magnified them, everyone would see plainer what they are."</p>

<p>He reflected. "Tenacity? That's no virtue...Though of course it
may be an advantage..."</p>

<p>The great lines of Wordsworth floated protestingly through his
memory and were ill received.</p>

<p>"But trailing clouds of glory do we come from God who is our
Home," he said and then added irreligiously, vulgarly and
outrageously: "I <i>don't</i> think. <i>His</i> clouds of glory
would smell of sulphur all the time."</p>

<p><br>
Aunt Julia was never able to put her finger exactly on Rudie's
complex&mdash;if so be he had one. Whatever it was, presumably it
remained unresolved and festering in his soul, and this story can
tell no more about it.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; V</h3>

<p class="first">Under the influence of old Doctor Carstall, Rudie
went to Hooplady House instead of having his subconsciousness
explored, cleaned-up and made over in a suitable establishment on
soundly psychoanalytical lines. Probably the results would have
been very similar. Hooplady House, as an educational institution,
never gave a thought to character and the finer shades of
conduct&mdash;except on Speech Days. Then the headmaster said the
boys were a household of young English gentlemen, and the parents
and prefects heard him with quiet self-approval.</p>

<p>By way of teaching, the school devoted itself to satisfying the
requirements of various respectable examining bodies, and unless
your behaviour militated against the attainment of that objective,
the school, as an organisation, did not concern itself about what
was happening to you inside or outside or between the hours devoted
to that purpose. Beyond the lines laid down by these examining
bodies it did not adventure. Why should it? If they did not know
what arrangement of obligatory and optional subjects constituted a
proper education, who did? Most of the boys were day-boys, and by
ordinary standards the tone was good. Filth was furtive, and such
vice as occurred was inquisitive, elementary, infrequent and
obscure. The head boy was a son of Doctor Carstall's, a taciturn,
fair, good-looking boy who seemed to do everything he did well and
with a minimum of effort. He won a sort of qualified hero-worship
from Rud, quite at the beginning of their acquaintance.</p>

<p>Rud was engaged in an all-in scrap with a boy who had called him
"The Stink." He had been jabbing at his adversary with a penholder
with a broken nib. But the fellow had got him by the wrist now,
only his left fist was free and he was getting the worst of the
punching.</p>

<p>Carstall appeared, tall and calm, standing over them. "Don't
fight with things like that, Whitlow. We don't <i>do</i> it
here."</p>

<p>"He's bigger than <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"Kick his shins if you must, junior's privilege, but don't use a
filthy thing like that. Might poison his blood. Or jab his eye.
What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>Explanation.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I</i> say he's not to be called that. Nicknames ought
to be tolerable. And Russell, you; tease someone your own size. Get
out of it, both of you."</p>

<p>There was a splendour, Rud thought, about such authority. "Get
out of it, both of you," he whispered to himself presently and
wondered how long it would be before he was head of the school.
He'd make 'em get out of it all right. But it seemed hard to him
that he wasn't to use pen-nibs or scissors in warfare. Very hard.
He was the sort of scrapper who would have invented
knuckle-dusters, if they hadn't already been invented.</p>

<p>On the whole he was less aggressive during his junior days at
school than at home. He was not much of a success at games and he
was held to all sorts of rules and customs he had been accustomed
to disregard at home with his brothers. He learnt quite early the
inadvisability of mowing down the wicket with his little bat when
he got out at cricket, or of quitting the game ostentatiously and
vindictively directly after he had had his innings, and he grasped
the necessity of having the football somewhere near at least, when
he desired to hack another player. He ceased to bawl and threaten
loudly when annoyed, but on the other hand he acquired a complete
set of the recognised English bad words, and he muttered them
ferociously whenever exasperated. Brother Sam he saw little of in
the school; he was in the upper division; and brother Alf just
drifted about him quietly, pursuing ends of his own. There was a
lot of smouldering goodness in Alf and a touch of religion. "You
didn't ought to say words like that, Rud," he protested.</p>

<p>Rud replied with practically the complete vocabulary. Alf put
his hands to his ears and said: "You might be struck dead for that,
Rud."</p>

<p>"He'd have to strike pretty near the whole school then," said
Rud, who had a keen sense of justice when he himself was
concerned.</p>

<p>He speedily displayed an active, insensitive intelligence beyond
his years. His memory was exceptionally good, his reception
uncritical. He bolted the feast of knowledge and threw it up again
with ease, completely undigested. He was indeed a born examinee,
and his progress up the school was exceptionally rapid. He competed
for marks vehemently. He was best at English, Geography, History,
French and Latin. He found mathematics tricky and problems
irritating. He could not ponder. Formulae he could tackle but not
problems. He got hot and cross in the face of difficulty. He was
all for cutting the Gordian Knot instead of fiddling about with it,
and he saw nothing idiotic in the classical story of Columbus and
the egg. Downright action was in his nature.</p>

<p>He read voraciously. His imagination was fired particularly by
the history of wars, conquests and campaigns. Then forthwith he
became Caesar, Alexander, Napoleon or Genghis Khan, whichever Rud
it happened to be. He conquered America with all Washington
Irving's Conquistadors, and subjugated Ireland with the sword of
Cromwell. He was Clive; he was Gustavus Adolphus. Fiction,
generally speaking, he did not like, there were too many of those
incalculable girls in it. He had no use for Fenimore Cooper and the
noble Indian, and books about big-game hunting merely strengthened
his innate distrust and dislike of animals. If ever he had to hunt
tigers, he decided, he would do it with explosive bullets from a
<i>machan</i>, a good high, strong <i>machan</i>. When he saw the
elephants and gorillas in the zoological gardens he thrilled with
hostility, and dreamt afterwards about fighting them with
machine-guns and catching them in the most horribly spiky pitfalls.
And when in his dream they just came closer and closer to him,
bleeding, half-blinded, but persistently undying and intent upon
him, he screamed and woke up in a frenzy of fear and hate.</p>

<p>Savages, barbarians, "natives," he "mowed down," he had no other
use for them. Omdurman was his ideal battle.</p>

<p>Since he was a day-boy and not very fond of games, and since he
could do his school work very quickly, he was free to take long,
solitary walks in which he could let his imagination run riot in
anticipatory reverie. To the passing observer he seemed to be a
small, rather slovenly boy, with a large, pale, egg-shaped face,
big end up, and usually a sniff, but in imagination he rode a
magnificent charger, or occupied a powerful car, and his staff and
orderlies and messengers buzzed about him, and his embattled hosts
stormed the farmhouses and villages of the landscape and swept over
the hills, while his pitiless guns searched their recesses. The
advance was always victorious, and with the home-coming came the
triumph. Usually Hooplady House was involved in that. The prisoners
stood before him. That drawing-master, a proven traitor, was shot
out of hand. Several of the upper boys shared his fate. The rest of
the staff were shot or reproached and insulted according to the
mood of the day. Sometimes his father and mother appeared on the
scene and were put under protective detention. Cousin Rachel, the
pincher, now in a greatly chastened mood, submitted to her fate.
Sam and Alf were rarely given r&ocirc;les.</p>

<p>But one figure was very frequent in these dreams. He was
sometimes the second in command, sometimes the opposite general
surrendering with all the honours of war, sometimes an ambiguous
political associate in the revolution, or the counter-revolution,
or the war of liberation, or the great conquest, whichever it
happened to be. His admiration for the generalissimo was extreme,
his loyalty amounted to devotion. This was Carstall. "My trusty
Carstall." Rudie never seemed able to keep Carstall out of the
phantasy. He never wanted to do so.</p>

<p>He whistled to himself as he took his imagination on these
excursions. He never learnt to whistle normally. It was a sort of
acid piping through his teeth and it lacked any consistent
tune.</p>

<p>And always he got home by twilight. For in the dark the kings
and captains departed, the fighting and the conquests died away,
and the small boy was left exposed to those bears and tigers and
gorillas, which escape so frequently from menageries even in the
most settled districts, and to criminals and homicidal maniacs and
hedge-bogies and all the shapeless terrors of the night.</p>

<p>As his mind grew and his reading expanded his reveries became
more realist and coherent, and darkness less menacing. He began to
study maps, particularly maps in which each country and its foreign
possessions were done in the same colour; he began to collect
pictures and comparative diagrams of armies and navies and air
forces. He was particularly keen on air warfare. Dropping high
explosive bombs together with printed warnings and proclamations,
appealed to him as just the perfect way of making war. He read the
newspapers with an avidity uncommon at his tender age. He knew the
salutes and symbols of all the dictators in the world and the inner
significance of every coloured shirt. And as he grew up towards
them, these heroes, these masters of men who marched like lurid
torches through the blue haze and reek of contemporary history,
seemed continually to come down nearer the level of his
understanding and sympathy.</p>

<p>So it was our Holy Terror nourished his imagination and
anticipated his career.</p>

<p>His extensive reading fed a natural disposition to accumulate
vocabulary. The staff realised that he could write the best
examination paper in the school, and told him so. He used long
words. Some of the assistants, and particularly the games master,
were disposed to discourage this, but the English master applauded.
"Nevertheless, take warning from our Hindu brethren," said the
English master, and lent him a facetious book about Babu English.
"If the new word sticks out among familiar usage like an unset
gem&mdash;excise it, delete it. A new word is like a wild animal
you have caught. You must learn its ways and break it in before you
can use it freely."</p>

<p>Rud took that to heart. He learnt to write a good, nervous
prose. He developed a certain gift for effective phrases.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VI</h3>

<p class="first">His early religious experiences did not amount to
very much and they played only a small part in his subsequent
career. Still, one may say a word or two about them before
dismissing them.</p>

<p>He was never God-fearing.</p>

<p>Nowhere in the world in his days was there any atmosphere in
which the presence of God was felt. The general behaviour of people
everywhere made it plain that whatever they professed when they
were questioned, they did not feel any such <i>Power</i> within or
about them. For most of them it would have been an entirely
paralysing thought to have been living in the presence, in the
sight and knowledge of an unseen and silent Deity. With indefinite
powers of intervention. The tension would have become unendurable;
they would have screamed. They dismissed the thought, therefore,
and they dismissed Him, not explicitly, of course, but tacitly and
practically. On most of their occasions, even the professional
religious people, from popes and archbishops down to confirmation
candidates, behaved exactly like atheists&mdash;as well but no
better.</p>

<p>Young Rudolf indeed heard very little about the supreme
immanence. Mrs. Whitlow had a delicacy about mentioning Him except
in connection with the Lord's Prayer and the Ten Commandments and
similar formalities, and Mr. Whitlow only mentioned Him on
occasions of dismay&mdash;as for example when he heard that Aunt
Julia had come in to see them. Then usually he would exclaim: "Oh,
<i>God!</i>"</p>

<p>From the outset young Rudolf put up a considerable
God-resistance. He read such portions of the scripture as were
chosen for his learning reluctantly and with incredulity and
aversion. Father was bad enough without this vaster Father behind
him. From all the world around him Rud caught the trick of putting
divinity out of his mind in the ordinary affairs of life. But only
by degrees. He had some bad times, usually about judgment-day and
hell-fire. They were worse to dream about than falling into tigers'
dens. He had called Alf a fool several times. That, he learnt, was
a hell-fire business. And there was very little on the other side
of the account. He had tried praying&mdash;as, for example, at
cricket for a score of twenty and then he had got out first
ball.</p>

<p>"All <i>right</i>, God," said little Rudie. "You see."</p>

<p>Then he heard tell that old Doctor Carstall was an atheist. The
schoolfellow who told him that spoke in hushed tones. "What's a
Natheist?" asked Rudie.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;he don't believe there's any God at all. Ain't it
<i>orful</i>?"</p>

<p>"He'll have to go to hell," said Rudie.</p>

<p>"He'll <i>have</i> to go to hell. And him so respected! It's a
frightful pity."</p>

<p>At his next opportunity Rudie had a good look at Doctor
Carstall.</p>

<p>He seemed to be carrying it off all right.</p>

<p>Then Rudie had an impulse to ask young Carstall about it, but he
did not dare.</p>

<p>There was something about this sinister idea of Atheism that
attracted him. It was frightful. Oh! unspeakable, but it had a
magnificence. Suppose really there <i>was</i> nobody
watching...</p>

<p>The things you might do!...</p>

<p>He did not talk very much about these high matters. They came
too close up to him for frankness or the risk of self-exposure. And
even had he wanted to do so most of the other kids would have been
too scared. But he listened to his elders. When he heard one of the
senior boys arguing that "somebody <i>must</i> have made the
world," it seemed a perfectly valid argument, though for any
practical purposes it led nowhere.</p>

<p>Gradually his thoughts took the shape of feeling that the God
one heard about in school did not exist, that they didn't mean it
whatever it was about the Trinity, but that nevertheless there was
a God&mdash;another God, that Maker&mdash;who went away&mdash;so
that you could do any little things you wanted to do&mdash;who was
indeed away generally, but who might at any time stage a tremendous
come-back. Then He would ask everybody what they had done with the
things of his making, and Rudie's impression was that most people
would look pretty silly long before it came down to him. There was
no reason Rudie could see why he in particular should be pitched
upon. He was quite prepared to turn God's-evidence against one or
two people he knew.</p>

<p>So far as Aunt Julia's edifying inventions about that exemplary
Christ Child were concerned, he believed in them only to the extent
of disliking him almost as heartily as he did his mother's
hypothetical dear little girl. And as for gratitude to anyone, who
needn't have done it, mind you, getting himself crucified (knowing
quite well he would rise again the third day) to save Rudie from
that hell-fire from which nevertheless he still somehow went in
great danger, that was something too spiritual altogether for his
hard little intelligence. Long before he was adolescent he had put
religion outside of himself and thought about it less and less.</p>

<p>His mother puzzled about him and tried to feel loving and proud
about him. If she had been quite frank with herself she would have
confessed to herself that this dome-browed son she had borne was a
little cad in grain, to whom unfeeling ruthlessness and greediness
and implacable wilfulness were as natural as night-prowling to a
hyena or an evil odour to flowering privet.</p>

<p>The chances of the genes had given her that, but her spirit
struggled against her luck. It was too much to admit. She knew
better than anyone how easily and meanly he could lie. She had
found him pilfering, and his instincts seemed furtively dirty, but
she could not think of her own flesh and blood in such harsh terms.
"His soul is unawakened," she told herself, "one must be
patient."</p>

<p>And after all, he <i>was</i> very clever at school, continually
top of his class and passing examinations with facility. His essays
were always "excellent"; he had an "instinct for phrasing". (If
only he would not boast to her so much about these things!) And if
he was horrid, he was interesting. That at any rate could be said
for him. With a certain compunction his mother realised that she
thought much more about him than she did about Sam or Alf. They
were no trouble. They were ordinary like their father. You loved
them, of course, but calmly. You did not distress yourself about
them.</p>

<p>For a term or so there was an earnest young assistant master in
the early stages of evangelical mania at Hooplady House. He
perceived the moral obscurity in which Rudolf lived and tried to
throw a ray of light into it. He got the boy to have a long walk
with him and, beginning artfully by botanising, led the talk to
ideals and one's Object in Life.</p>

<p>It was mostly his own Object in Life he talked about. Rud was as
hard to draw as a frightened badger. The earnest young assistant
master confided that he himself might not live very long. He
believed he was tuberculous. Once or twice he had coughed
blood.</p>

<p>"I spew up all my dinner sometimes," said Rud, faintly
interested, "and last Easter my nose bled something frightful.
Until mother got a cold key."</p>

<p>"That isn't like tuberculosis, which just eats your lungs
away.</p>

<p>"Don't worms?" said Rud. "I saw a picture the other day of liver
fluke in a chap's liver. Something horrid. You get it from eating
watercress."</p>

<p>The earnest young assistant master shifted his ground abruptly.
"I'd hate to die before I had done something really good and fine
in the world," he said. "Sometimes I think I'd like to take orders.
After I've got my B.A. London it wouldn't be so difficult. And then
I could do God's work in some dreadful slum. Or go to a leper
colony. Or be the chaplain of a hospital or prison. It would be
fine to go to a war&mdash;as a chaplain, just upholding the
fellows. Helping them. Toc-H and all that. Don't you ever want to
do things like that?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to be a machine-gunner," said Rud.</p>

<p>"Oh, but that's <i>killing!</i>"</p>

<p>"Well, what will <i>you</i> do if this next war they keep
talking about now really comes?"</p>

<p>"I should certainly <i>not</i> be a soldier. Among other things,
I doubt if I am physically fit. I should either get into a Red
Cross Unit or go as a padre. Under fire, of course&mdash;into the
front line. But without a weapon in my hand&mdash;ever."</p>

<p>"Everyone isn't like that."</p>

<p>"There would be no more war if they were. What a death it would
be, to stand out boldly between the lines and cry aloud, 'Peace,'
holding out bare hands to both sides."</p>

<p>"You'd get peppered to rights," said Rud, regarding the young
man's exalted face with extreme disapproval.</p>

<p>The assistant Master was lost in a vision. He stood still with
shiny eyes and face uplifted and his thin, white, knuckly hands
were tightly clenched. He made his companion feel uncomfortable and
absolutely resolved never to come for a walk with him again.</p>

<p>"There's a shorter way back over this next stile and across the
fields," said Rud after a lengthy pause.</p>

<p>And that is as much as need be told of the spiritual
circumstances of Rudolf Whitlow in his youth.</p>

<p>There is no record that his soul ever awakened. There is no
record that it stirred even in its sleep. There is no evidence
indeed that he ever had a soul.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap1_02" name="chap1_02"></a>II. &mdash; D&Eacute;BUT</h2>

<h3>&sect; I</h3>

<p class="first">The country was already in a very disturbed state
when Rudolf Whitlow's schooldays drew to an end. He had believed
that his facility in passing examinations would lead up through a
ladder of scholarships to university distinction, security and
authority. In the stabler past he might have made such an ascent
and rounded off his career as a formidably malicious, secretly
vicious, conservative don, the sort of don who is feared and
propitiated during his lifetime and forgotten gladly almost before
he is dead.</p>

<p>Father Whitlow wasn't doing at all well in business just then,
and he had heard that a son at the university was an expensive
responsibility. Neither of Rud's brothers was doing well. Sam
didn't like his job. He complained that it gave him no hope
whatever of promotion, but he was afraid to quit it because jobs
were now so difficult to find, and Alf, after one or two futile
starts, became conscientious to a painful pitch and deeply
religious. He hung about at home being inconveniently helpful, and
on one occasion his mother, going quietly upstairs, was horrified
to find him praying on his knees. After a time he got tentative
employment in Doctor Carstall's dispensary and brightened up a
little. Carstall found him slow but very careful and exact, and
spoke well of him in a faintly contemptuous way. And also he
increased his pay and said encouraging things to him.</p>

<p>But Rud's white face during his last two terms at school became
more and more resentful and lowering.</p>

<p>He resolved to have things out with his once-dreaded father.
"I'm going in for these scholarships whether you like it or not,
And you'll have to pay the fees."</p>

<p>"I tell you it's no <i>good</i>," said Father Whitlow.</p>

<p>"What else can I do?"</p>

<p>"Edjicated proletariat&mdash;and what good's that?"</p>

<p>"If I get top&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You won't get top."</p>

<p>Rud, regarding his father, looked still capable of
knife-throwing.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you do something to help?" intervened his mother.
"Write for the papers? Do tutoring?"</p>

<p>"And eat up all my blasted time and energy!"</p>

<p>"Better than nothing," said Father Whitlow.</p>

<p>"Look at my brothers! Look at old Sam stuck in the mud from the
very start&mdash;for good and all. Look at Alf! Under-educated.
Under-qualified. Making pills in slow time. Meek and holy. While
young Carstall soars away to be a great physiologist. What have you
done for us? Give me one chance. See? Give me my chance, while
there is a chance."</p>

<p>"Look here, Rudie, you've got to be reasonable. How was <i>I</i>
to know that business was going from bad to worse? I always meant
to give you a chance."</p>

<p>"<i>Meant!</i> What's <i>meant</i> to me?"</p>

<p>"This depression; it's <i>got</i> us. It's got everybody."</p>

<p>"And did you ever do anything to prevent it? Or dodge it? Some
of them have dodged it. Got you&mdash;of course it got you. Did any
of your generation ever think of escaping it? And so&mdash;here I
am. One of the victims. I won't stand it, Father, I tell you. I'll
fight. You let me go for those scholarships. See? You let me go in.
Time enough to tell me I can't do it when I've failed."</p>

<p>"I can't face the expense of it."</p>

<p>"As though you had a choice now. Not a bit of it! You owe it to
me. D'you hear? You <i>owe</i> it to me. What did you bring me into
the world for? What did you bring me into the world for? To let me
down <i>now!</i>"</p>

<p>Tears of indignation shone in his eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Whitlow had been watching the disputants. "Rudie dear," she
said.</p>

<p>"Did I <i>ask</i> to be born?" said Rudie.</p>

<p>"Rudie!" she said, and put her hand on his.</p>

<p>He snatched his fist away. "Ow!&mdash;Rudie!
Rudie&mdash;<i>rot!</i> It makes me <i>sick</i>."</p>

<p>"Listen, Rudie."</p>

<p>He glared at her.</p>

<p>"Maybe we could manage it. Maybe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"There's my insurance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"It was always meant for you."</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> the others," corrected Father.</p>

<p>"Never mind <i>him</i>," said Rudie. "Tell me."</p>

<p>His mother made a halting explanation. The policy had a
surrender value. It might make things possible.</p>

<p>"What about the other boys!" protested Father.</p>

<p>"You give me my chance," said Rudie, "and I'll carry the darned
lot of you&mdash;I'll be an omnibus camel for the whole darned
family. Trust me. But if I can't take up these scholarships, I'm
done. I'll blow my brains out. I'll throw myself into the canal.
And I'll leave a letter to scald the skin off you."</p>

<p>"I'm sure you'll do yourself justice, Rudie," said his mother
gently, "if you have half a chance."</p>

<p><br>
And so he was able to do himself justice, and the large, white,
bilious face with the permanent, resentful scowl, frequented the
streets of Camford beneath the exiguous tassel a second-hand
mortar-board cap, for four hardy and strenuous years.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; II</h3>

<p class="first">While Rud Whitlow pursued his studies at Camford,
such as they were, the disintegration of the civilisation into
which he had been born went on steadily. Human society had in fact
been progressing too fast; it had slipped up on mechanisms and
dislocated its class disciplines and traditions. It was in a bad
way; it was possibly in need of a major operation. History was
passing into a new and very perplexing phase. The scale and pace of
life had altered and mental habits had failed to keep pace with the
alteration. The social cog-wheels were failing to mesh with one
another and they ground and jammed more and more violently. At
first he did not apprehend this at all clearly, but the perception
of it seeped into his mind.</p>

<p>Mankind put to the test was indeed displaying the most
extraordinary inadaptability, politically, economically,
educationally. The sole ideas for relieving tension that anyone
seemed able to entertain, were the suicidal alternatives of blind
social insurrection to shift the stresses to other classes on the
one hand, or aggressive war to shift the stresses to other nations
on the other. No one seemed to think of relieving the stresses. One
resounding crack followed another in the mighty edifice of
confidence and traditional usage which was the essential framework
of civilised society. Abyss after abyss yawned open wider and
wider. Insecurity appeared at the most unexpected points. And
amidst it, like an ant in an earthquake, our hero ran about and
grew up.</p>

<p>It did not take him long to realise the advancing malaise of his
world. Hints of disillusionment, impalpable but cumulative,
gathered in his consciousness. Doubt accumulated in his mind and
would not be dispelled. The ladder of academic competition and of
promotion to assurance and dazzling opportunity, that he had
started to climb, which by all precedents should have made him more
or less a member of a definite governing class and opened the door
to legal distinction or political opportunity&mdash;or at very
least to the higher civil service and security&mdash;acquired a
quality of unreality, became less and less credible until at times
it seemed more like some inaccessible spiral staircase seen in the
central incandescence of a burning house than a permanent method of
ascent.</p>

<p>It was hard for him to believe that he of all people had
misjudged his world, that even now that he had got to Camford, it
was going to be a much more difficult world than he had supposed.
He thought about it at nights and he betrayed an intense
exasperation when people made banal remarks about it to him.
Apparently the whole system of things had conspired to anticipate
his ambitions and corner and defeat him.</p>

<p>But indeed the whole system of things was not thinking of Rud at
all. It was thinking and thinking very incoherently about itself.
More and more of the two thousand million or so who constituted
humanity were falling into very much the same line of thought and
feeling as that along which he was drifting. It was like the way
particles change their orientation in a magnetised bar. It was like
bits of crumbling ore falling one after another into a flux. This
sense of insecurity was spreading about the entire planet, and
though people went on doing the things they usually did, they had
none of the assurance, the happy-go-lucky "all-right" feeling, that
had hitherto sustained normal men. They went on doing their
customary things because they could not think of anything else to
do. They tried to believe, and many did succeed in believing, that
there would presently be a turn for the better. They did nothing to
bring about that turn for the better; they just hoped it would
occur. All the same, they were worried. Rud was very seriously
worried. He had no disposition to believe in the natural
benevolence of the universe.</p>

<p>"They ought not to have let things come to this," he said, but
he was never very clear even to himself who or why "They" were nor
what "This" was. Some person or persons unknown was to blame. He
hated these unknowns in general. But he was unable to focus his
hatred into hating some responsible person or persons in
particular. If only he could find who it was had neglected to do
something, or had done something wrong or messed about with things,
they would catch it. He'd get even with them somehow.</p>

<p>There had been a time when Camford was the very heart of
conservatism. It was a bilateral conservatism in those
days&mdash;and one half of it was called the Liberal Party. It
dominated the country without effort as a matter of course. It
changed and remained the same. It radiated out over an unresentful
empire in a state of unindicted exploitation&mdash;on which a sun
of unimpeachable loyalty never set. Odd specimens of the more
coloured subject-races came up to Camford and objected to something
or other, but in such funny Babu-English that their complaints
dissolved in laughter. In these happy days the tradition of the
careless, wealthy, young gentlemen ruled the whole university from
the richest Fellow Commoner to the poorest scholar. The only use
for subversive ideas was the opportunities they afforded for
privileged rags. People with revolutionary minds and "advanced"
notions were invited to address meetings and conduct debates, and
were then kidnapped, ducked, personated and so forth, all in the
most perfect good-humour and with the unostentatious approval of
the authorities.</p>

<p>But when Rudie went up, those golden days were already ancient
history. He had read about them in books, but behold! they were
over. The Great War had strained Camford, and Camford, after a
phase of hectic optimism while it was reconstructing what was left
of the old undergraduates who had gone to the front, remained
strained and began even to realise how strained it was. A subtle
change in the quality of the multiplying students and the younger
dons, due to the belated but extensive expansion of lower
middle-class education and the development of what was called the
educational ladder, had gone on and continued. A new, uneasy type
was swamping the ancient confidence of those venerable colleges,
young men who said: "Yes, <i>but</i>&mdash;" to everything, over
whose apprehensive minds the perception of decaying privileges and
of imperial enervation, shrinkage and decline, hung more and more
heavily.</p>

<p>For a year and more Rud stuck to his lectures and books. The
teaching of Hooplady House had been urgent for examination
successes rather than first-class in itself, and he had much to
revise and supplement. Then he began to take notice of events
outside the classroom.</p>

<p>Camford, since the mediaeval cosmogony had broken down and the
Catholic scheme of salvation had fallen into disuse, had never made
the slightest attempt to give any coherent picture of the universe
to the new generation that came to it for instruction. Its Church
of England orthodoxy broke down with Catholic emancipation and an
influx of Dissenters and Jews. Since then nothing in Camford except
a few dreaming spires had pointed anywhere. Inertia had carried the
old place on for the better part of a century. It resisted novel
ideas and scientific aggression as long as possible by the method
of slight and innuendo, and when it could resist no longer it
yielded in the true Anglican style with ambiguous and nearly
inaudible acquiescences. This lulled the minds of a certain
proportion of the young people and diverted their energies to
games, rage, amateur theatricals, amateurish poetry and amateurish
literary criticism, and the less easily tranquillised ones resorted
to the bookshops in the town and to a diversity of intrusive
movements that promised in the most various ways to satisfy that
impatience for plain direction towards a concrete objective which
is one of the natural cravings of ripening adolescence. At first
these uneasy ones had been a small and derided minority, but in the
post-war days they multiplied rapidly.</p>

<p>In his school days he had devoured books whole. Now he was
realising that standard history had little to tell about what was
happening in the world. He began to attend political gatherings and
discussion circles; he took to reading and comparing a number of
newspapers; his large brow and lowering expression were to be seen
at the back of stuffy and draughty rooms, disliking and
scrutinising the speakers and watching every reaction of the
audience. He was puzzled, but he hung on, and his mind became more
and more involved in this extra-academic stuff. He joined the Union
and snorted and growled and indulged in ironical and imperfectly
audible comments through three discussions. Each time he wanted to
speak and didn't dare. Then at a debate upon the resolution: "That
a drastic change in our economic life in the direction of
collectivism is long overdue," he wrenched himself up from his
seat, drew a deep breath and began his maiden speech.</p>

<p>He spoke for the motion. Words came. He found he could think on
his legs. He could forget himself in his subject. Once started, his
speech rambled indeed, but rambled interestingly. His sentences
flowed easily. They were going over, he realised. He was less and
less scared and more and more fluent. He was keeping his head and
quite aware of what he was doing. He found he could hold a
sentence, even quite a long sentence, bring out its conclusion with
an emphasised clearness and a punch at the air that made it seem
significant even when it was not. He worked himself up into a
generous indignation. He ended in a whirl of patriotic anger.</p>

<p>"This is what they have made of our country! This is our
inheritance!" The "old men" caught it, the privileged incapables,
the greedy, short-sighted business organisers, the military caste,
finance, the party "gangs". All the recognised cockshies. Indeed
they caught it. Even "people in high places."</p>

<p>"Wake up England!&mdash;that was said thirty years and more ago.
And see where we are! We of the new crop! Where are <i>we</i> to
go? Go into the cadet corps, go into the flying corps!
Yes&mdash;yes. Though those others died, they thought, to save us!
We're in the soup and we've got to do it over again, my masters.
We've got to do 1914 over again. It'll be our turn sure enough. The
way they're going. We've got to face up to it. But not under the
old fools and rogues, Sir, this time&mdash;not with the profiteers
at our heels. No, <i>Sir!</i> This time we fight with our eyes
open, with our eyes wide open."</p>

<p>And so on, growing loud and harsh, but still keeping pretty
clear, more and more sure of himself. Betsy Barnacle would hardly
have recognised the voice that had squalled upstairs in Mrs.
Whitlow's room eighteen years before, but it was the same voice
growing up now, as protesting and as unquenchable. The speech was
the success of the evening. It was what so many of his hearers had
been feeling. But they had not been able to let themselves go as he
did. More and more applause broke into his flow. They liked him.
They really liked this thick-set figure with the punching gesture
and the big head. His words had the rather attractive bitterness of
quinine.</p>

<p>He sat down amidst a buzz of applause.</p>

<p>In one crowded half-hour Rud had become a Camford personality.
Men discussed him in their rooms that night, and young dons talked
about him.</p>

<p>"That was a pretty good speech," said a voice beside him as the
gathering broke up. "A bit angry of course."</p>

<p>He looked up and saw Carstall at his elbow. That gave him a
thrill. Carstall was already a research Fellow and his work in
physiology was being talked about.</p>

<p>"How did you vote?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I voted with you, of course," said Carstall. "I'm all for a
revolution&mdash;maybe more of a revolution than yours. I don't
know. Mine is the cold deliberate sort and yours is the hot
indignant stuff, but we're revolutionaries all right. It takes all
sorts to make the world budge."</p>

<p>"We're revolutionaries all right," from Carstall, gave a
peculiar confirmation to Rud's self-approval.</p>

<p><i>We!</i>
</p>

<p>Other hands got hold of his sleeves and caught at his elbow and
drew him away from Carstall. Or he would have liked to have
lingered for a moment over that. Men who had ignored him and even
avoided him were asking him to come along to their rooms for a
talk. Others were obviously intent upon questioning him.</p>

<p>He was not prepared to answer questions, he realised. He had
made a strong impression and he must not complicate it. A natural
turn for tactics came into play. "I'd love to," he said, "I'd love
to but I've two hours of work to-night before I go to bed..."</p>

<p>"No. No. It's work that won't wait..."</p>

<p>He hoped they got the faint flavour of mystery in that work that
wouldn't wait.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to speak at all to-night. My ideas ran away with
me..."</p>

<p>He felt he was doing it all magnificently. He was elated with
himself. He disengaged himself, got away to his own rooms and
locked himself in.</p>

<p>It required a considerable effort to do this. There was
something intoxicating in this sudden transition from contemptuous
negligence to interest. It was the first time he had felt visible
in Camford. But he knew that he had to get out of it. He had to
adjust himself before he betrayed how little he was adjusted. His
speech quite as much as its reception had taken him by surprise. He
hadn't thought it was in him. Even the ideas he had expressed
struck him as new. They had come up out of him.</p>

<p>He sat before his fire for a long time in a state of confused
self-congratulation. If he could go on with this sort of thing!
Dreams he had kept at arm's length before he now accepted frankly.
"Leadership," he whispered. "The quality of leadership. Maybe I
have it. Maybe I really have it.</p>

<p>"Man to man I don't count for much, but man to meeting! It's
going to be different. I wonder why. And&mdash;yes I <i>can do
it</i>."</p>

<p>He began that acid whistle between his teeth that had been the
common accompaniment of the walking day-dreams of his schoolboy
years&mdash;at first very softly and then loudly.</p>

<p>"A great speech, Rud, my boy. A magnificent speech!" To that he
had expanded Carstall's "pretty good speech."</p>

<p>"Leadership. Leadership. Leadership." The word sang through his
brain.</p>

<p>He found himself in a vast dreamland auditorium compelling great
waves in that time-honoured "sea of faces".</p>

<p>He thrust out his fist, held it up to the level of his forehead
and glared at his arm-chair. It was his natural gesture, arrested
and held. The room was filled with phantom applause.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; III</h3>

<p class="first">"Your son, I see, Mr. Whitlow," said Mr. Skindle,
the watchmaker, "has been getting into the papers. Seems he's been
making speeches."</p>

<p>"Whe-where? I didn't see it," said Mr. Whitlow.</p>

<p>"It's in the <i>District Weekly</i>," said Lozanda. "I
<i>saw</i> it too. 'Local scholarship winner' they called him. Just
a paragraph copied out of the <i>Camford News</i>."</p>

<p>"Says he's a Rising Red," said Mr. Cramble the grocer, with a
stern eye over his pipe.</p>

<p>The paper was handed to Mr. Whitlow and there was silence while
he read the news.</p>

<p>"Now that's serious," he said. "You never know what to do with
that boy. Always breaking out in a new place. It won't do him any
good at Camford to be figuring about as a red".</p>

<p>"It will <i>not</i>," said Mr. Cramble.</p>

<p>"Seems he don't like the idea of this new war that's coming,"
said Lozanda. "<i>We</i> had a dose. I don't see why these kids
shouldn't be soaked a bit. Make men of them."</p>

<p>"Or crosses," said Mr. Skindle. "You don't know what it is to
have a cross out there, Lozanda. <i>I</i> do. Ain't there no way of
escaping it?"</p>

<p>"Not by talking Red Treason," said Mr. Cramble. "I don't know
what's happening to all these youngsters nowadays. Restless they
are&mdash;extravagant. No respect for established things. As if
they were all waiting about for something they didn't quite like,
to come out of the night and happen."</p>

<p>"I <i>did</i> think Rudie had settled down to work," said Mr.
Whitlow with a rising sense of grievance. "We made sacrifices for
him."</p>

<p>"Seems the generals are old fools and the admirals old fools and
the bankers and business men fools and knaves," said Lozanda with
the <i>District Weekly</i> as evidence in his hands. "He's got a
hot tongue, that boy of yours. Hope it won't get him into
trouble."</p>

<p>"Always had a hot tongue," said Mr. Whitlow. "Fancy his breaking
out at them like that...<i>Silly</i> young fool! Always talk, he
would. Always. Burst out&mdash;like. After our sacrifices."</p>

<p>He took his troubles home with him. He walked about the bedroom
undressing, and delivering his soul. "I ain't going to stand for
it. I sent him to Camford to get a first-class degree and a
permanent job. I didn't send him to Camford to get ideers. Who's
going to listen to a young fellow like him telling them off? I ask
you."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Whitlow answered nothing, because she had been reading
over again Hans Christian Andersen's story of the Ugly Duckling.
Ugly, Rudie certainly was. Nasty, too. Cunning and mean to his
brothers. He could say the most horrid things...He seemed always
angry about something...Why should he be angry?...Maybe if one
understood him better...understood him better...</p>

<p>She went to sleep.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; IV</h3>

<p class="first">Rud did not make another speech for a week or so,
and even then attempted nothing so elaborate as his first outbreak;
his instinct told him that a second oration in the same term would
not <i>do</i>; he wrote nothing but lecture notes, gave four hours
a day grimly but with a watch on his desk, to text-books, and
talked with the utmost discretion. He felt that something very
important had happened in his life and he did not quite know what.
In such brief leisure as his steadfast pursuit of a good degree
permitted him, he would catch himself dreaming over a gazetteer and
an atlas, or reading books about Napoleon and Hitler and Mussolini.
Or simply he dreamt and schemed. If he could move people once, he
could move them again...</p>

<p>He did his best to control those extravagant reveries. For they
went even beyond the range of his schoolboy battle-dreams.</p>

<p>People made his acquaintance now&mdash;almost with an effect of
seeking him. This did much to confirm his new-born sense of his own
value. If there was something they valued in him, then he would be
a fool to give it away. Of course these reveries were reveries, but
for all that there might be something in them. He could not help
posing a little. He regarded his various visitors with a faintly
hostile expression, hands behind his back, replied without
committing himself to anything and summed them up one after another
in his own mind.</p>

<p>The latest thing in religion presented itself one afternoon as a
man too old for an undergraduate and too oily and shiny for a don,
a queer fish with a slightly American accent. He had called, he
said, and stopped. Whitlow thought he might be a canvasser. But he
was much too rich and smug-looking for that.</p>

<p>"I heard your speech," resumed the intruder. "You have, what
shall I call it?&mdash;mental energy. You have persuasive
power&mdash;oh&mdash;great persuasive power. There was something
<i>contagious</i> in your indignation. I feel it imperative upon me
to implore you not to waste these gifts."</p>

<p>"I have my ideas," said Rudolf. "What do <i>you</i>
suggest?"</p>

<p>"Where do they take you?"</p>

<p>"Nowhere yet. I asked you what do you suggest?"</p>

<p>"Have you Guidance?"</p>

<p>"Tell me about it."</p>

<p>The visitor wanted to walk about the room. He had played for the
hearthrug but Rudie had got that. "<i>Do</i> sit down," said Rudie.
"In that chair there, the low one. No; I cannot listen to you if I
have to keep on watching you moving around. It distracts me. What
is this Guidance?"</p>

<p>"Guidance," said the visitor, sinking into his chair. "Just
that."</p>

<p>Rudie replied with an uncivil monosyllable.</p>

<p>The missioner was spurred to exposition. "You don't know," he
said.</p>

<p>"I'm asking you."</p>

<p>"Let me illustrate."</p>

<p>"I'm attending."</p>

<p>The illustrations rambled a good deal. Rudie listened with a
lowering expression, that hampered the teller. He spoke of the fear
and uncertainty in so many lives nowadays, the constant struggle
against sinful impulses, of suicidal moments and how when at last
it broke upon them&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> broke upon them?"</p>

<p>"Guidance!"</p>

<p>"Ugh!"</p>

<p>"<i>Guidance</i> and the fellowship of those who share. Then
everything grew simple, everything grew plain."</p>

<p>Rudolf remained in a pose of enigmatical attention. He realised
that he was embarrassing this spiritual windbag. He liked that.
There was power in this still silence; it was giving him an
ascendency. It was a sort of hypnotism. He must try it again.
"Don't you feel <i>something</i>&mdash;?" said the visitor, trying
to break this stony irresponsiveness.</p>

<p>"You go on with what you came to say," said his host.</p>

<p>Presently he brought the interview to an end. It was a sudden
inspiration came to him. He lost his breath for an instant and then
forced himself to speak.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he said. "This Guidance brought you here?"</p>

<p>"I felt impelled&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and now, don't you think it about time that Guidance
packed you up and took you away again?..."</p>

<p>When his oak closed on the intruder, Rudie's stern face relaxed
into a delighted grin. His mature earnestness fell from him like a
mask. He stuck out his tongue at the door and then put his thumb to
his nose and spread out his fingers in twiddling triumph.
"<i>That</i> for you and your Guidance," he said.</p>

<p>By which it is manifest that he was still only very partially
grown-up.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; V</h3>

<p class="first">That was the only approach made by any sort of
religious organisation to our emergent young man. Whatever other
forms of faith flourished at Camford were apparently under the
impression that Rudie might just as well be damned. But various
politicians of a markedly "junior" character enquired about him.
They waylaid him in stony corridors; they accosted him in the
reading-room; they came to his room. There were Liberals who just
talked party politics of the most arithmetical sort and failed to
pass quite elementary examinations on what they meant by Liberal
principles; there were rather beefy Conservatives, one of them
titled, with an ill-concealed quality of condescension, who seemed
to regard the Empire as a sort of alluring Juggernaut to whom one
would naturally and gladly prostrate oneself; there were shrill
Indians who tried to win his respectful adhesion to their dusky
cause, by proving with chapter and verse that the English were
cheats, liars, oppressors and only temporarily necessary to India;
there were Pacifists, some of whom were total abstainers from life,
neo-gnostics in fact, while others seemed to make an exception in
favour of serious eroticism. And there were middle-class Fabians,
those painless permeators, with schemes for expropriating the rich
and powerful so subtly that they would never know it had happened
to them, and various leftists, Stalinists, Trotskyites and so
forth, including several earnest young peers, who agreed that what
was needed was a vehement class war and a proletarian revolution.
And also he had a call from two oafish, unprepossessing, young men
in purple vests who talked against the Jews. Their indictment of
the Jews was a little flimsy, but there could be no question of the
earnest gusto with which they advocated the ancient sport of
Jew-baiting. They wore broad leather belts and their jersey sleeves
were rolled up as if on the off-chance of finding a pogrom round
the corner. They told him Judaism was a wicked conspiracy to rob,
corrupt and enslave Gentile mankind. He did not believe them for a
moment. But he was quite polite to them because they were so very
hefty. He did not argue with them, but he paid visible
attention.</p>

<p>"You aren't called upon for any action," said the largest of
them. "Just speak. We want speakers with ginger."</p>

<p>"I couldn't make a speech on the Jewish question to save my
life. I haven't got it up."</p>

<p>"We could give you material."</p>

<p>"No," said Rudie, shaking a smiling face with modestly resolute
conviction.</p>

<p>"You aren't by any chance a Jew yourself?" said the smaller (but
still considerable) purple-shirt, and his eye roved about the room
as if in search for convenient breakables.</p>

<p>Rudie had a nasty moment and then decided upon a virile line.
"If I was about four stone heavier," he said, "I'd smash your
blasted jaw for that."</p>

<p>It got a laugh, and the situation eased.</p>

<p>"Come along, Colin," said the big one. "He's not even a
Pacifist. But you ought to read the Protocols of Zion, you really
ought, Mister&mdash;? I didn't get your name?"</p>

<p>Rudie felt now that he was safe on the bantam tack. "I haven't
got yours," he said.</p>

<p>They pulled up their jerseys in search of pockets and produced
cards. They handed them to Rudie with a friendly solemnity, bowed
genteely and, forgetting all about a return card, louted off down
the staircase with an air of something accomplished, something
done.</p>

<p>"Blaggards," said Rudie when their footsteps had died away and
the door was safely shut. "If I was a Jew I'd get a revolver. I'd
get a razor like niggers do."</p>

<p>And his mind went back to his shin-kicking days, when he had
thrown knives and jabbed with scissors and pens...</p>

<p>But it did not go forward to the time when myriads of such
"blaggards" would march at his bidding.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VI</h3>

<p class="first">Of all the movements fermenting through the
venerable halls and colonnades and the narrow lanes and winding
streets of Camford, the Communists had the most convincing air of
meaning something and definitely going somewhere. Their scientific
pretensions, the aggressive confidence with which they sustained
their remarkable, though incomprehensible, Hegelianism, impressed
him, and their bias for revolutionary violence was all in their
favour. But their doctrinaire inflexibility and intolerance did not
attract him.</p>

<p>A large, fat young man at one of their meetings was quite
interesting about the Seizure of Power. That sounded like sense. Of
course one must seize power.</p>

<p>But Rudolf did not join the "Party". He spoke at a meeting and
intimated a certain sympathy, but he kept outside. He did not speak
very well on that occasion. There was something uncongenial in the
atmosphere for which at first he could not find a name. It was as
if he lacked some shibboleth and was out of court from the
beginning. And not only that. They set their new adherents, he
gathered, to do all sorts of undignified and time-wasting jobs,
such as distributing unconvincing leaflets and selling newspapers
full of stale provocation. And they were
shepherded&mdash;shepherded was the word&mdash;by a post-graduate,
one Jim Mortland, who had been four times to and fro to Moscow and
behaved like a Malay who had been to Mecca. He had the languid
authority of a rather jaded sergeant-major with a batch of new
recruits. He seemed always to be transmitting orders from higher up
and far away. Moscow? Why the devil should wisdom centre at Moscow?
Why should Spain be the only arena for revolutionary activities?
What had all this stuff to do with Rudie's perplexities and English
social and economic unrest? And moreover, there was this
Stalin-Trotsky split, a world-wide scolding match, irrelevances,
personalities, alien issues, imported stuff. Where was it likely to
take this bunch of English trailers? He attended one or two
meetings; there were one or two young peers and hardly a single
real proletarian&mdash;and suddenly he found the missing
word&mdash;<i>dilettante!</i> That settled Camford Communism for
him. It wasn't good enough. So for a time he remained politically
indeterminate.</p>

<p>Yet his reveries now were all of political adventure. The
success of his speech had lit and given a direction to his
ambition, and every day it burnt more brightly. He felt in his
bones now that he had the making of a political figure. Once he
started. His very indecision about the line he had to take marked
the seriousness of his intentions. He found his inclination towards
a sort of scheming reverie more and more of an interference with
his work.</p>

<p>A day or so before the end of the term he went for a walk by the
Cramb meadows to get tea at Chuck's Hill Farm. He had cleared up
all his work and he felt free to indulge to the full in that
ancient vice of his.</p>

<p>His thoughts ran over these various movements he had sampled.
His ruling thought was what he could do with them and what they
could do for him. "One has to take a line of one's own," he said,
"and all the same, if one is to get anywhere, one has to have an
Organisation&mdash;with a capital O. One must go over big or not go
over at all. You've got to have a newspaper. Newspapers. Radio
talks. Great halls. Stewards. It has to be paid for. You've got to
have backers...</p>

<p>"One might capture some organisation..."</p>

<p>In his reveries capturing an Organisation involved a good lot of
timely shooting.</p>

<p>What was it caught people? What was it caught backers? What got
faithful adherents? What was it made them believe in you? So that
you got started? Other people got supporters. You had to be
obviously successful to hold them and you had to give them
something, something that they felt they could not get or do or be
themselves...</p>

<p>Brooding in the warm afternoon sunshine over the Chuck's Farm
tea-things, with unlimited supplies of Mother Braybone's newish
bread and admirable butter and home-made strawberry jam, all things
became possible. His thoughts were like the printed text of a book
that has been over-illustrated by a far too enthusiastic
illustrator. The text kept to a certain level of possibility, but
the reverie soared fantastically and magnificently. He found
himself presently with a group of intimate colleagues, devoted to
him. (They really were devoted to him.) And behind them was the
party, <i>his</i> party.</p>

<p>Would they wear a shirt?</p>

<p>Shirts were overdone. Brown shirts, green shirts, black shirts,
purple shirts; the idea was played out. The Whitlow-men wouldn't
have that. They'd have belts. They'd have trousers with elastic
webbing in them and belts with heavy buckles that could be whipped
off in a moment for a fight. Good. And by way of recognition, a
badge, a badge worn <i>inside</i> the jacket, like the sheriff's
badge in an American gangster film. A good idea that!</p>

<p>What to call them? The Whitlow men? The Rud men? They'd have to
have a slogan. Something to shout, something to stick on their
banners.</p>

<p>And an idea? He had long thought that the separation of the
United States and the British Empire was a terrible waste of
strength, that a drive for reunion could be made very popular, and
that gave him, "The man who speaks English is my brother." Because
nowadays, now that we were drawing so near to America by air and
radio and common dangers, why should not our political movements
straddle the Atlantic?</p>

<p>So far it had never happened. Even their Communists and our
Communists were different. But that needn't be so now. And that
altered everything. This was a great thought for Rudie.</p>

<p>The reverie produced a vision of the mighty canyons of the New
York City streets as he had seen them in photographs and pictures
and films, and people were scattering torn-up paper from the
windows upon the milling swarms below, and great banners hung
across from one side to the other bearing his slogan. "The man who
speaks English is my brother." There was an immense excited crowd,
all displaying badges, all Rud men. It was a tremendous occasion.
Rud had arrived in America. The Big Union had been achieved.</p>

<p>Why not? Various things stood in the way, of course; the
monarchy, ancient prejudices, irritations, suspicions on both sides
of the Atlantic. Rud's imagination swept them aside.</p>

<p>The reverie suddenly produced a touching meeting between a
British monarch, a very hypothetical British monarch, and Rud. "Our
family," said the monarch, opening his coat suddenly and displaying
the hidden badge, "have been Rudmen and Rud-women for some time. If
it is necessary to Anglo-American coalescence for us to efface
ourselves, we are prepared."</p>

<p>An almost religious reverence came into Rud's eyes as he
contemplated this beautiful present from his imagination, over an
unusually large, an almost fervent bite of jam-spread bread and
butter.</p>

<p>He found he had to assist that excessive mouthful with the back
of his disengaged hand.</p>

<p>Then he blushed at his own puerility, finished his slice in a
more business-like way, emptied his cup of tea and produced and lit
a cigarette.</p>

<p>"The problem," he whispered, "is to find those nuclear
associates. Then we could start something...</p>

<p>"But we have to give them something <i>new</i>...</p>

<p>"All these things that are going on now&mdash;communism, fascism
and all that&mdash;they are nearly played out&mdash;they are
three-parts dead. By the time <i>I</i> get going it would be like
crying stinking fish to go in for any of them. A new appeal. It has
to have a freshness, whatever it is..."</p>

<p>And then suddenly it seemed to him that he saw an idea, a
programme, a scheme of operations, a way to success plain before
him. For a moment he had the impression of something full and
completed, the exact thing needful. His mind just stopped at that
and stared at it&mdash;as one might stare, if suddenly a door
opened in a hitherto impenetrable and unclimbable wall and
revealed&mdash;the dark and indistinguishable landscape of some
unknown land on which no sun had ever yet risen. And then it was as
if the door slammed again.</p>

<p>"If they're all <i>out</i>," he whispered. "And if there is a
right way&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>They</i> haven't got it. Any of them...</p>

<p>"But if one <i>did</i> get it!"</p>

<p>He seemed to see the confusion suddenly crystallising under the
spell of a magic word&mdash;some missing elusive word&mdash;surely
he had had it quite plain only a moment before!&mdash;and in his
reverie, he it was who had shouted that word. And now it had gone.
Gone altogether.</p>

<p>What was it? That missing Sesame?...</p>

<p>What was it? What was it?</p>

<p>There was an extraordinary blankness upon the sunlit meadows and
the steel-blue, winding Cramb...</p>

<p>He sat stock-still for some time realising his hallucination
only very gradually. His cigarette went out between his fingers.
Then, still with a dazed expression, he roused himself and began
rattling his spoon against his cup to get his bill.</p>

<p>Returning to college he was still trying to recall something
that had never really been in his mind.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VII</h3>

<p class="first">Old Doctor Carstall, whom Mrs. Whitlow considered
so big and deliberate, had often wanted to talk things over with
his son, things in general, fundamental things, what everything was
for and what one thought one was up to, and things of that sort,
and like all intelligent fathers he was afraid of his son and shy
of him. These young people, he felt, know so much more than we do
and so much less than we do; one ought to make some sort of
show-down to them and get some idea of what they thought they were
doing. There ought to be that much continuity between the
generations. His son's visit to his home <i>en route</i> for the
Alps, that trite and wholesome and not too expensive playground for
the earnest young don, seemed to give just the occasion needed.
They sat at dinner, an excellent dinner, for the doctor was an easy
and stimulating master to his cook.</p>

<p>"The world seems in a queer state nowadays," the old man began.
"What do you make of it all, Dick?"</p>

<p>"An old world dying, a new one unable to get born&mdash;Who was
it said something like that?"</p>

<p>"Only worlds don't die and get born again," said the doctor. "If
a world dies, it dies, and there's an end to it. There's no more on
its line...You <i>might</i> perhaps&mdash;Of course, if you're
thinking of obstetrics, the image might just pass...Died in
childbirth...Something of that sort...<i>Is</i> your world dying,
Dick? And what are you doing about it?"</p>

<p>Young Carstall had been sitting at his ease and he had answered
his father after the manner of casual conversation. Now he sat up a
little. He felt the slovenliness of his previous response. "No one
of my age, sir, thinks his world is dying," he said. "It isn't
natural. But we're certainly in for troubled times. Dangerous
times.</p>

<p>"Those fellows who lecture to us about the world and who talk on
the radio and write in the magazines and papers and all that have
got hold of a phrase lately; what is it? Ah!&mdash;<i>imperfect
adaptation</i>.</p>

<p>"Not bad as an elementary statement. Don't you agree, Father?
Imperfect adaptation to all the new powers and implements in the
world. Following them up clumsily, using them vulgarly and not
keeping pace with the new possibilities and dangers. Particularly
the dangers. Air-war and disorganisation generally. It seems fairly
obvious."</p>

<p>"A few years ago we used to talk about morality failing to keep
its ascendency over&mdash;what was it?&mdash;material
progress?"</p>

<p>"Said by bishops usually, Father. I don't attach much value to
all that <i>scolding</i> of aeroplanes and the cinema and the radio
and motor cars and so on. No. It's the moral side which has to
adapt. It always <i>has</i> had to adapt. There's no such thing as
a fixed and final morality. Though the bishops like to think so.
The immutable laws of Heaven! They're like obstinate men with a
dying patent&mdash;or a vanishing trade. Their stuff doesn't
<i>go</i> any more and they won't give it up. No, they won't give
it up. Until the Church files its petition in bankruptcy and there
are no more stipends forthcoming. But their game is pretty nearly
over, all the same. We have to get new values and ideas to fit
these inflexible new facts we've got ourselves up against. Or come
a cropper."</p>

<p>"You mean?"</p>

<p>"Political ideas. Religion. History. Ownership. All the ideas we
have about such things are threadbare and rotten and splitting. I
suppose they've all got to be changed. The material facts won't
change."</p>

<p>"Such facts as?"</p>

<p>"Three hundred miles an hour travel. News almost instantaneous.
Limitless power. Over-production&mdash;whenever you try in the
least, that is. Health control. Population control. No animal has
ever faced such changes in what it can do and what it can bring
down on itself, and survived."</p>

<p>"I know that song, Dick. Yes. I can sing it almost in unison
with you. I guess we agree pretty completely about all that. Man is
now a new animal, a new and different animal; he can jump a hundred
miles, see through brick walls, bombard atoms, analyse the stars,
set about his business with the strength of a million horses. And
so forth and so on. Yes. Yes. But all the same he goes on behaving
like the weak little needy ape he used to be. He grabs, snarls,
quarrels, fears, stampedes and plays in his immense powder magazine
until he seems likely to blow up the whole damned show. Eh?"</p>

<p>"That's on the face of things, Father."</p>

<p>"That's where we stand. That's our situation."</p>

<p>"That's our situation. Yes...You read your <i>Nature</i>, I see.
You keep up with the times."</p>

<p>"I shan't do that much longer, Dick."</p>

<p>"You're good for another twenty years. I don't need to be a
doctor to tell you that."</p>

<p>"Not very good for action now. Retiring from active practice.
Quite soon. Yes. I see the distant land of the future like Moses,
but you&mdash;you have to carry on...The problem comes to you.
Sixty years of life may be in front of you. Sixty tremendous years.
What are you going to do about it, Dick? Is it all going to happen
to you or are you going to do something about it? It's for your
generation now, you know, to do something about it. No good blaming
us. That won't help you."</p>

<p>"Inform ourselves, I suppose. Readjust our imaginations. Think
out a new behaviour."</p>

<p>For an interval the elder man answered nothing.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he resumed presently, "that some sort of mental
renascence is possible. A sufficient renascence. I hope so. But I
see very few signs of it. That adaptation you talk about...There's
a lot of unteachable stuff in humanity. Down here I've been
watching a little section of mankind, bringing new individuals into
the world, seeing the old ones drop out of it, seeing the insides
and the undersides and the backsides of the creatures. Queer stuff
and weak stuff, they are. Mean. A lot of malice in them. And also a
sort of obduracy. Do you know that almost always they lie to me
about themselves. Their doctor, I am, and they lie to me. Out of
self-protective vanity&mdash;mostly. They come for advice and then
they fake their facts and dodge their medicine. Only just a few
work with me. Silly stuff, they are. Intricately silly."</p>

<p>"All of them?"</p>

<p>"Most. There's differences. Considerable differences. They vary.
Their imaginations vary. And their <i>go</i>. Very widely. So
widely that at times I seem to be dealing with different species of
creature. But on the whole I don't <i>see</i> that renascence of
will and understanding which is needed to head off catastrophe.
No..."</p>

<p>He paused, but his son remained silently attentive.</p>

<p>"Maybe it isn't altogether hopeless. Maybe there are different
species in mankind&mdash;all mixed up. That idea seems to be
getting about, Dick. You must have heard of it. Maybe the real
differences in men lie in the kinks of their brains. Scattered
about among the silly multitudes there <i>may</i> be men of a
different quality&mdash;with a different power of vision."</p>

<p>"A sort of anonymous unsuspected aristocrats?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"So you don't believe in democracy any longer?"</p>

<p>"I never did. Look at 'em! Do you?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to."</p>

<p>"But you don't."</p>

<p>"But during your forty years of practice," said the younger man,
"hasn't there been a certain amount of general, all over, mental
progress? More education, more books, more information? Not enough,
I admit, but some. If only we were able to increase the tempo of
that sort of thing?..."</p>

<p>The old man shook his head with a smile of unbelief.</p>

<p>"You'll never get the whole lot intelligent. You'll only widen
the gap. A born fool is a fool to the end. Maybe there will be more
and more of the right sort proportionally. As they get
opportunities to emerge. But the crowd will remain a crowd and
behave like a mob...That's where I stand, Dick."</p>

<p>"I don't like to feel that is right. Somehow&mdash;at my
age&mdash;and with a sort of implicit reservation about our noble
selves, you know, Daddy..."</p>

<p>He made a grimace.</p>

<p>"You don't like that, and neither do I. At my age, too, Dick. It
makes me feel&mdash;uncomfortable, to admit even to myself that
there are these differences. But if the truth is that all men are
not equal, then is it <i>fair</i> to treat an inferior as an equal?
Even at golf you give a handicap. And I don't ask my patients to
vote on their treatment and then blame them for the result."</p>

<p>Then with a change of manner that his son found very
characteristic, he said: "This is getting academic..."</p>

<p>Dick didn't seem to mind. He was plainly interested in this
evidently long-meditated discourse. He waited for his father to
resume.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, the practical outcome of all these crude
democratic ideas, is that men of our quality&mdash;yes, damn it! we
<i>have</i> a quality&mdash;excuse themselves from the hard and
thankless service they owe&mdash;not to the crowd, Dick, but to the
race. (Much good it will do us to shirk like that in the long run.)
We will not presume, we say, no. We shrug our shoulders and leave
the geese, the hungry sheep, the born followers, call them what you
will, to the leaders who haven't our scruples. The poor muts
swallow those dead old religions no longer fit for human
consumption, and we say 'let 'em'. They devour their silly
newspapers. They let themselves be distracted from public affairs
by games, by gambling, by shows and coronations and every sort of
mass stupidity, while the stars in their courses plot against them.
<i>We</i> say nothing. Nothing audible. We mustn't destroy the
simple faith that is marching them to disaster. We mustn't question
their decisions. That wouldn't be democratic. And then we sit here
and say privately that the poor riff-raff are <i>failing</i> to
adapt themselves to those terrible new conditions&mdash;as if they
had had half a chance of knowing how things stand with them. They
are shoved about by patriotisms, by obsolete religious prejudices,
by racial delusions, by incomprehensible economic forces. Amidst a
growth of frightful machinery..."</p>

<p>He stopped short and stared at his son and his son smiled back
at him faintly and nodded for him to go on.</p>

<p>"You haven't been watching a community for four full decades,
Dick. I have. My practice here is a fair sample of mankind...I have
seen a sort of self-confidence fading out of this world. Like a
twilight. When I bought this practice everyone who came to me,
every man Jack of them, felt he had a place in the world, that
there were things he ought to do, and things he mustn't do. Maybe
people were a little lower then, nearer the earth, but that was how
things were. A normal man got along in a system he thought he
understood. <i>Now</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dick, people aren't nearly as straight in business as they
were. They've ceased to feel that honesty is the best policy.
They've found themselves put out of business by competition they
think unfair. They try to get even by counter-cheating. And they
aren't clever enough. They find the incomes they had counted on,
their pay or what not, raided by taxation, shattered by currency
manipulation and slumps, knocked to pieces by all this messing
about with money, this inflation, deflation, and all the rest of
it. Even the wages-earners never know now what their money can buy.
And more and more of them are pottering about with poor little
parcels of stocks and shares, hunting after Capital Appreciation.
That's the great phrase now. I've heard it three times from three
separate people this past fortnight. There's ten men speculating in
a small miserable way for one who knew his way to a broker forty
years ago. Ten, do I say?&mdash;fifty! They lie awake at nights.
They get chronic indigestion. They get neurasthenia and neuritis.
Some are frankly betting. These football pools are a sort of
disease of vain hopes, social dropsy. The <i>women</i> bet. It was
unheard of in the old days. There's hardly a man in my area now,
Dick, under fifty, who finds any satisfaction in a job well done,
or believes that it will secure him any sort of reward. Think of
what that means in social stability...</p>

<p>"And the women I have to deal with, Dick, the younger women;
they're <i>all</i> demoralised as we understood demoralisation.
They don't understand themselves. There was a certain amount of sly
adultery and still slyer fornication going on then, but it didn't
disturb the even surface of things. It was just healthy
incontinence...Chastity now is out of fashion. Children are an
encumbrance. The women want, or feel they ought to want, a sort of
gadding-about amusement and a man has to pay for it. They sell
themselves almost frankly, wholesale or retail. They aren't steady
because the men aren't steady. The men are insecure and rattled and
the women follow suit. You'd be amazed, Dick, at the people who
come along nowadays hinting at abortion..."</p>

<p>He hesitated and plunged. "What <i>are</i> you making of women,
Dick? What are you going to do about all that?"</p>

<p>"I like them," said Dick after a long, downcast pause for
reflection. "I like them a lot."</p>

<p>"And they like you?" said his father.</p>

<p>"Things have changed, Father."</p>

<p>"Mutual comfort, eh? That's all got relaxed. It's all different
from the repressions of my time. Perhaps it's not worse, perhaps
it's better, but it's all shockingly different...And that sort of
thing is not going to eat you up?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so. No. So far it hasn't done any harm to my
work, and I don't think it will."</p>

<p>"Sex," his father reflected, "used to have a certain biological
significance. And social aspects. And a kind of idea of mating. Is
all <i>that</i> changed?"</p>

<p>"It's changed in a way, yes."</p>

<p>"And what becomes of your young women in the end? Rather jaded
little bitches, eh? Some, anyhow. Some don't seem to suffer much
damage, but most who go loose stay loose. And a loose woman who is
getting old is a damn nasty thing...And yourself, Dick, as you grow
older?"</p>

<p>"I think I shall marry. Long before I grow nasty. You ought to
have some grandchildren, you know. It won't be a grand
passion...Maybe it's a defect, Father, but the truth is I don't
like romance in love. I like humour...</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that <i>mating</i> business either. Women's
minds don't seem to move with ours. They don't keep step with us.
I've seen that. I guess I shall have time to think about it some
more before I fix myself. When Adam delved and Eve span, there was
a sort of partnership. But now&mdash;do men and women hunt in
couples? <i>Can</i> they? Under the new conditions. My work...I'd
hate to have a wife who knew too much about my work. When I was
going slack, when I was casting about in my mind, preoccupied, in
that sort of exasperating, dissatisfied worry one <i>must</i> go
through, when one is feeling about for something missing. Think of
the horror of a nice intelligent question at the breakfast-table!
'Tell me all about it, darling'...But all the same I'd hate to have
a wife who knew nothing about it."</p>

<p>"There's a middle way," said his father. "Maybe you'll not
marry, Dick, maybe you'll never <i>find</i> a wife at all, but all
the same some woman will come along, who will think you over and
decide to marry you. And do it. I'm inclined to think that's the
way things are going. Anyway it's the way things <i>ought</i> to
go. It's <i>their</i> business really. Damn it! What else are they
for? You aren't likely to be too rich or too conspicuous, to
attract the exploiting sort. But you're not unattractive,
Dick."</p>

<p>"I take after you, Father, a bit."</p>

<p>"<i>You'll</i> be picked all right. But it will be more her
business than yours, and if things go on as they are going, she'll
probably ask you. I've watched people. Picking out women by men is
silly. They don't give their minds to it. Far better have it the
other way about. Though I doubt whether they ought to pick much
before two or three and twenty. That's by the way. Be sure she has
our sense of humour, Dick, and then marry her and thank God for
her&mdash;even if she gives you moments of doubt. A woman with
unsatisfied desires or a craving vanity is the worst thing in life,
but a woman with living and responsive things to protect and take
care of, is the best. Believe me..."</p>

<p>And then the doctor made what he firmly believed was an entirely
original, outstanding and remarkable statement&mdash;the statement
that a countless multitude of widowers in his position have been
moved to make.</p>

<p>"There never was a woman in the whole world," he said, "so good
and uncomplicated, so generous and self-forgetful, as your mother.
I wonder if you remember her. I never knew anyone with so swift and
sure a judgment of character. You couldn't harbour a mean thought
when she was about. And yet she regarded politics as a kind of male
silliness&mdash;like a hunt or race-meeting&mdash;she thought
science was woolgathering and she hadn't the slightest idea of
the&mdash;the blundering uncertainties of medical practice. She
thought I cured whenever a cure was possible. Fifteen years ago,
she died, and I talk to her in my dreams still. I think of things I
should like to tell her. Sometimes when I am in trouble and
sometimes just because I want to share something with her. But one
can't do things like that, Dick. So that's that...I'm wandering,
Dick, from what we were talking about..."</p>

<p>He mused for a moment and returned to his original drift.</p>

<p>"You think your scientific work is good enough to hold your
imagination and carry you on? It opens out, eh? That second paper
of yours certainly had a periscope. It ranged...Sometimes I think
we biologists may find ourselves coming into politics from our own
angle. If things go on as they are going&mdash;We may have to treat
the whole world as a mental hospital. The entire species is going
mad; for what is madness but a complete want of mental adaptation
to one's circumstances? Sooner or later, young man, your generation
will have to face up to that."</p>

<p>He stopped and looked at his son's face.</p>

<p>"Those&mdash;what was it we said?&mdash;anonymous unsuspected
aristocrats," said the younger man, and thought.</p>

<p>He leant forward on the table and picked his way among his ideas
as he spoke. "I have an idea, Father, a half-formed idea, that
before we can go on to a sane new order, there has to be a far more
extensive clearing-up of old institutions...The world needs some
sort of scavenging, a burning-up of the old infected clothes,
before it can get on to a new phase. At present it is enormously
encumbered...This is just a shadowy idea in my mind...Something
like breaking down condemned, old houses. We can't begin to get
things in order until there has been this scavenging phase. And,
you see, what one might call civilised men can't do that sort of
rough work."</p>

<p>"I suppose it <i>has</i> to be rough work?"</p>

<p>"What do you think? Conservatism insists on it. The old order of
things, the patriots, the priests and the old laws won't
<i>deal</i> with reasonable men. They won't hear of it. They're
cunning, they're subtle in their way. Subtly stupid. They've got an
unintelligent suicidal instinct for what they think is
self-preservation. They <i>won't</i> stand criticism; they
<i>won't</i> adapt. They'll listen and seem to agree and they'll
play tricks. They're afraid of any light, any clearness. They fog
education. They obstruct. What! Deal with <i>us!</i> They're much
more disposed to deal with the roughs and turn them against us.
You've got to capture the rough from them, you've got to use the
rough against them, educate him, civilise him&mdash;as far as he
will stand it."</p>

<p>"A bit roundabout and underhand," said the old man. "Modern
jesuitry. Rather on old Marx's lines, eh? Call these roughs
'proletarian' and there you are! Flatter them until you've
organised their discipline. Maybe I misunderstand you?"</p>

<p>"I'm telling you my ideas, Father, as well as I can. You've
asked for it. But I see no way out of the present break-up, but
'Let the best rough win'. Then so soon as you've got a top rough in
the world, he'll have to organise efficiently to save himself from
the next possible rough, and he'll have to be quick about it. The
bigger he grows&mdash;and you know the next rough may be
world-wide&mdash;the less of the administration, the less of the
planning he and his gang will be able to control, and the more
he'll have to use and trust the able, resolute, relatively
unambitious type..."</p>

<p>"Meaning our sort? Our virtuous sort? Eh?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"After the democracies, the demagogues who become dictators and
after them a World Civil Service? Fabian permeation and all that.
And I'm not so sure of that Civil Service. It may develop a high
standard of comfort and a taste for dependants."</p>

<p>The young man reconsidered it. "All sorts of complications and
interludes," he said, "but, like it or not, that I take it is the
general shape of the story ahead. A World Civil Service if you
like&mdash;but based, that's the restraining force&mdash;on a World
Public Opinion."</p>

<p>"Something of that sort," said the doctor, with a grape in his
mouth, "existed in Egypt. In Ancient Egypt. Which was practically a
world in itself. B.C. two thousand. Charming cultivated
people."</p>

<p>For a time they gave their attention to dessert.</p>

<p>"Civilisation has always been something of a patch-up,"
reflected the doctor. "You seem pretty convinced that it has to be
worse before it is better...I agree...This particular earthquake
looks likely to be the biggest so far. How do you see it in terms
of yourself, Dick? You may not be able to keep out of the way of
these&mdash;what do you call them?&mdash;scavengers. Concentration
camp or prison examination. You cannot smash and remake a social
system without breaking men&mdash;incidentally and
accidentally&mdash;and the chances may pick on you to be broken. It
may degrade you, Dick. You won't be able to help yourself if your
skull gets burst open or your brain or your mind gets exhausted or
poisoned. After all, it won't be the end of the world, but it may
be the end of <i>your</i> world. That's as may be, you say...I
agree...It will mean you will begin your decay before you are dead.
A slight but nowadays not an uncommon inversion of the normal
order. But an end comes to all of us. Until then and while you are
yourself, you mean to keep a stiff backbone. Eh? No cringing, no
compromise."</p>

<p>"I want that," said his son. "A stiff backbone, I mean. As long
as possible I will keep out of money-making and politics and the
scrambles and stampedes, and go on with my special work. You've
made it possible. But if a straight challenge comes, if I'm
absolutely prevented from working or if I see a plain occasion
before me and my sort..."</p>

<p>"Working, waiting and watching for something that may call you
and compel you...Waiting for the time when dictators dwindle and
roughs relax...You might do worse...For the life of me, I don't see
what else there is to do now. If you fight them now you'll only
fight for the old system."</p>

<p>With a palpable effort not to seem self-indulgent and to throw a
sacramental flavour about the gesture, Doctor Carstall poured
himself some of his own very excellent brandy. "Good luck to you,
my son. I'm glad we've had this talk."</p>

<h2><a id="chap1_03" name="chap1_03"></a>III. &mdash;
EXPLORATION</h2>

<h3>&sect; I</h3>

<p class="first">Rudie went down home for the Long Vacation because
there seemed to be nowhere else to go. But in his state of
adventurous unrest he found home altogether unendurable before a
week was out. His father with a manifest disposition to administer
discouraging advice, his mother with her general air of asking him
not to (whatever it was) for her sake, and his brothers with their
ill-controlled jealousy of his Camford advantages, were all so
tiresome, and the district when he tried a lonely walk or so, so
full of stale memories, that he felt himself driving towards one of
those smashing and screaming and abusive outbreaks that had
disfigured his childhood. But among the disciplines he was imposing
upon himself for ambition's sake, was the practice of self-control.
He had buried, even if he had not killed, little Rud the
knife-thrower. But he had not buried him very deep. Once or twice
his father exasperated him almost to the verge of a
resurrection.</p>

<p>"You've got to work hard at Camford, my boy, and mind what they
tell you," said his father, "for it's your only chance. And you
mustn't make enemies, my boy. You mustn't make enemies."</p>

<p>"Ow! <i>Who's</i> making enemies?" snarled Rudie.</p>

<p>"I didn't say you <i>were</i> making enemies, my boy. I didn't
say that. You catch me up too quick. I said you <i>mustn't</i> make
them."</p>

<p>"Ugh!"</p>

<p>"What I say is for your good, my boy. You've got a quick tongue
and you may give offence before you know where you are. I know.
I've lived. I've given way to wit in my time or I might have been a
better-off man than I am to-day. When I was young, before I learnt
better, I was a good deal like you, my boy. Very like you.
<i>Quick</i>. And something of your gift of the gab. No sooner did
I think of a thing than I was out with it. It made me enemies. And
all this saying things about politics and socialism and people.
Seems clever at the time..."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Criky!</i>" said Rudie <i>sotto voce</i>...</p>

<p>He decided that somehow he would wangle five pounds out of his
mother and go off for a walking tour. Anywhere. He was wasting his
time here. He couldn't even study; he had no room to work in and no
seclusion. He felt perhaps if he went through the country looking
in on meetings, listening to speakers at street corners, talking to
people, he might get ideas. He'd wear old clothes, take his stuff
in a rucksack, be a university gentleman, incognito, so to speak. A
lot of fellows nowadays were doing that. Odd lodgings and doss
houses. And weren't there hikers' camps and road-houses? He'd
manage all right.</p>

<p>He would head for Birmingham or Sheffield and then turn north.
He might find a strike going on and anyhow he'd get a glimpse of
industrial conditions. There'd be unemployed men to talk to. He'd
find out what kinds of organisation were possible among them. If
the weather was fine he might cultivate a sunburn by a few days on
the Lancashire moors or in the Peak country. What he would have
liked to do was to have gone to New York and prowled with his eyes
and ears open. He was now very keen to learn about America, and in
the vacation away from the Union he could not even see <i>Time</i>
or the <i>New Yorker</i>. He hadn't the money to buy them. And as
for crossing the Atlantic, he had neither fare nor time now.
America must wait. He might get in touch with those Mass Observers
one was beginning to hear about, but they might keep him too busy
for his private concerns. He had no desire to do jobs for other
people. If he had thought of it before he might have joined one or
other of the conferences that were always afoot now in some hostel
or other, but that might have involved a subscription he could ill
have afforded. But anything was better than stagnation and more
father.</p>

<p>Mother had been watching him. She was ready for his appeal and
helped him out with it. She got the five pounds somehow. She got
together six pounds ten shillings.</p>

<p>"Of <i>course</i>, dear, you want more of a change than you get
here..."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; II</h3>

<p class="first">He found little to excite him in the first two
days of his pilgrimage and he was beginning to feel more than a
little solitary when he came upon Chiffan. It was in the late
afternoon and he was consuming as big a tea as he could manage with
eggs and cake and jam at a pleasant generous little wayside
cottage. He was going on a two-meal system, hearty breakfast and
late high-tea and that was all. He found it the most economical way
of feeding. And perforce he had become a strict teetotaller.</p>

<p>Chiffan, it seemed, was on the road in much the same spirit. He
was an older man than Rudie, he might have been twenty-six or
seven, and he had a pale, intelligent face with a decided nose, a
faint, wry smile, bright, rather distraught, grey-blue eyes and
untidy, dark brown hair. His trousers were relaxed grey slacks and
he wore a knitted blue pullover in place of a jacket. His gear
beside him was in an ancient Japanese-cane valise which he carried
by a strap, and he had a stout cabbage-stick laid across the table.
He studied Rudie for a time and Rudie, looking up from a copy of
the <i>Daily Worker</i>, found he was being accosted.</p>

<p>"Doing a lonesome hike?" asked Chiffan.</p>

<p>"Looking about at things," said Rudie.</p>

<p>"Sociology? Mass observation? Something of that sort? I see
you're reading the <i>Daily Worker</i>. Communist, maybe?"</p>

<p>"No-o," said Rudie, finding himself hard to explain and making a
mystery of it. "No. Just interested. What are <i>you</i>
doing?"</p>

<p>"I make no secret of it. I'm a disgruntled communist wandering
about like a lost dog. The Left's gone to pieces...Stalin and
Trotsky...</p>

<p>"Spain...</p>

<p>"United Front rot. When there is no sort of unity..." Rudie was
in the completest agreement.</p>

<p>"Anti-Fascist. Anti-Purple shirts. What a <i>lot</i> they are!
What good is it being just Anti-? It lets the other side choose the
battlefield and you have to run after them and attack. <i>They</i>
say it first and you say 'No'. Look at this rag."</p>

<p>He smacked the <i>Daily Worker</i>, so to speak, in the
face.</p>

<p>"Now <i>that's</i> an idea!" said Chiffan alertly, taking in
what Rud had said. "That's a real good idea. Yes. Anti-. If you're
just Anti-. That lets the other chap choose his battlefield. Good!
Oh, <i>good!</i>"</p>

<p>Rudie felt he could like this stranger. "Well, that's how I see
it," he said modestly. "We want something positive. Surely we do.
I've been feeling that lately. I tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Chiffan stuck out a long forefinger. "The old game is up," he
said. "You've got it. We want a new formula. That's what we
want&mdash;a new formula! <i>As</i> you say. Exactly what I have
been saying! And until we get it, I'm going back to my brother's at
Booksham to help him get out the <i>Booksham Messenger</i> and do
general printing. I'm disgruntled, I tell you&mdash;deadly
disgruntled, and that's all about it. I'm just going to drop in to
the New World Summer School at Wexley on the way, but I don't
expect anything much from <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"And what might the New World Summer School be?" asked
Rudie.</p>

<p>Particulars were forthcoming. They discovered themselves similar
and sympathetic from the outset. There seemed no reason why they
should not visit this school together.</p>

<p>They set out for a four-day tramp to the New World Summer School
and as they tramped they talked, and while they ate they talked,
and they talked while they sat in woods and under shady trees
beside pleasant rivulets or hung over the parapets of little
bridges during the heat of the afternoon, and when they shared a
bedroom they talked most of the night, and when they slept in a
Youth Hostel they talked and argued until the consensus of opinion
that they ought to "Shut Up" could be disregarded no longer.
Chiffan declared loudly and frequently that he had rarely met
anyone with the freshness and lucidity of Rud, and Rud knew that in
Chiffan he had found just that experience, response and
appreciation that would bring out all the best that was in him. As
he talked he discovered brilliant opinions in his mind that he had
never even suspected were there.</p>

<p>Chiffan was in a phase of disillusionment, and his disbelief in
people and especially in the leaders of the left world was acute
and acid. But he had a gift for admiration. It is a winning gift.
He was prepared to admire Rudie, but at first only on condition
that he joined in a general denigration of the distressful world
about them. He wanted a world revolution and everything completely
upside down more passionately but much less hopefully than Rudie.
He had the advantage of eight or nine years of experience. He knew
more people and he had watched the careers of many more people. He
had done a considerable amount of journalistic work. He had always
been against the Government. He had picketed. He had rioted. He had
been locked-up. He had been married in some imperfect way that had
come undone, but he laid no stress on that. He could talk more
abundantly than Rudie, though he lacked his facility of phrase. And
he found something very sustaining in Rudie's manifest belief that
there were still possibilities of revolutionary activity in the
world. With reconstructed formulae. (Great phrase!)</p>

<p>Three main topics interlaced during their four-day tramp to the
New World conference. One was Rudie's notion that the revolutionary
movement in Great Britain should cut away from continental
associations altogether and get into the closest co-operation with
American revolutionists.</p>

<p>"You can't work with people who not only speak a different
language," said Rudie, "but who're in a different phase. None of
these Communists ever seem to think of that. We are laying out a
revolution in a democratic country. That's our phase. Isn't it? But
Russia is in a phase of"&mdash;he scarcely hesitated before the
words rolled out&mdash;"precocious Communist senescence."</p>

<p>"Precocious Communist senescence! Oh grand, man! Oh, simply
<i>grand!</i> And you're <i>right</i>."</p>

<p>"Spain, on the other hand, isn't even up to Marx. This anarchist
syndicalism of theirs! It's pure Rousseau. Read Sender. It's a
hundred and fifty years behind us."</p>

<p>"You're so <i>right</i> about this."</p>

<p>"But America and here are not ten years apart. Some things
they're ahead and some things we are. <i>That's</i> our fight.
Hands across the sea. One tongue. One culture. Take a hint from the
Anschluss..."</p>

<p>That was Rudie's chief contribution.</p>

<p>Chiffan brought in the second theme and that was the monetary
question. "It took me a time to see it, and most of them don't see
it themselves, but those currency cranks have <i>got</i> something.
Mark my words, Rud! They've really <i>got</i> something. They've
got something fundamental. Money, you see, is the key to the whole
property problem. Socialism is just William Morris and <i>News from
Nowhere</i> until it has a theory of money. Socialism has been
poking about in the factory when it ought to have been going
through the books in the counting-house. Setting the worker against
the employer has been barking up the wrong tree. It's the banker,
Rudyard, it's the private banker. The Bank is the key position in
the social war. Go for that. Control banking, control the issue of
credit&mdash;and money, you know, is only a credit
counter&mdash;and private enterprise is yours to do just exactly
what you like with."</p>

<p>This took some explaining and wrangling. It was newish stuff for
Rud. But Chiffan was tremendously equipped for that argument. They
went about the whole question and came back to this bit of it or
that. Rud would get new ideas and objections in the most unexpected
circumstances and hurry to find Chiffan and expound them. Before
they got to the summer school Rud was no longer talking of
"Capitalists", he was talking of "Money Barons".</p>

<p>(And here in parenthesis we may note that henceforth we must
call our Rudie, Rud and nothing else. Because Chiffan had assumed
from the outset that Rud stood for Rudyard. When he had used
"Rudyard" for the third time, Rud reflected upon the matter and
decided not to correct him. He had always had a faint dislike to
the foreign romantic flavour about Rudolf, and he felt now that for
a potential demagogue in the great English-speaking community, it
would be a serious handicap. He began to think of himself as
Rudyard. A time was to come when he would not even recognise
himself as Rudolf Whitlow.)</p>

<p>The third and more absorbing topic between these two young men
was the possible creation of a New Revolutionary Party. It was all
very well to be a great revolutionary leader in reverie, but at
first it seemed almost indecent to Rud to expose that secret
thought in conversation in the sunlight. Still it had to be brought
forward.</p>

<p>"These other fellows," he said, "after all, compared to us, they
aren't so <i>wonderful</i>. How did they get there?"</p>

<p>How did they get there? Or to be nearer the intention of the
question; how can we get there?</p>

<p>Here Chiffan's eight years of observation and detraction was of
the utmost value. Rud became his lively and intelligent pupil.</p>

<p>They canvassed this leader and group and that. Chiffan explained
the faults and failures of the endless imperfect coagulations and
dissolutions and recoagulations of leftism with the utmost
lucidity. He had an astonishing memory. The two of them began to
shape out more and more definitely the movement and organisation
that was needed to correct that tangle of faults. It was to be
Anglo-American (<i>and</i> Dominion. <i>Certainly</i> Dominion)
from the start. It was to adopt an attitude of self-respecting
co-operation towards the good industrialists. It was to promise
abundant money and abundant cheap goods in a world relieved of rent
and financial overheads. It was to pursue the banker and the Stock
Exchange and all "speculation" pitilessly. There were to be no
rent, no debentures and no sort of mortgages in the new world, and
the State was to take care of the people's savings and lend their
money for them to initiate profitable
enterprises&mdash;guaranteeing an adequate return. "The land", they
would say, "is the State's and the fullness thereof".</p>

<p>"Not a bad slogan," said Chiffan. "I like that biblical twang!
Fullness thereof!"</p>

<p>"The land for mankind and the fullness thereof," tried Rud,
always a little fastidious about phrasing.</p>

<p>A tremendous benevolence welled up in them, especially on the
finer afternoons, as they sketched their economic programme. They
seemed to feel already the grateful response and the eager support
of mankind. They settled the little matters of shirts in favour of
Rud's badges and they tried over a lot of other slogans and argued
out the main conditions of launching a movement.</p>

<p>A point Chiffan made that seemed fresh to Rud was the necessity
for invading and "capturing" already existing groups and
parties.</p>

<p>"We've got to capture people," said Chiffan. "You can't be like
Cadmus and the dragon's teeth; you can't call a party out of
nothing. Nearly everybody who is politically-minded enough to join
a party has joined a party already. Our party would have to
raid..."</p>

<p>"Now <i>that's</i> an idea," said Rud.</p>

<p>"And where?"</p>

<p>"You know better than I do."</p>

<p>"I've cast about in my mind," said Chiffan, "since I chucked
communism in London. But not very hopefully until I hit upon you.
Now things look different somehow and I'm casting about in my mind
more than ever. There's these Guidance people...No. No. Not to be
sniffed at like that. They gather a lot of raw stuff. They're worth
raiding. Then there's that fool Lord Horatio Bohm and his purple
shirts&mdash;mauve shirts really they are, for he never had the wit
to get his shirts fast colour. There's a deuce of a lot of money
behind him, a lot of meaty young men and precious little in the way
of ideas. Sort of vaguely anti-communist and that's about all.
Fancy dress and ragging. Aristocratic&mdash;nothing to do with the
blasted bourgeoisie. They might be ready to take on a good set of
ideas&mdash;and there you are!"</p>

<p>"They <i>do</i> want speakers," said Rud. "In fact...I was
approached...You know they're anti-Jewish?"</p>

<p>"Because that fool can think of nothing else. He's quarter Jew
himself. It obsesses him. He's always running away from that nose
of his and it annoys him by keeping just in front of him. However I
merely mentioned him by the way. For the sake of illustration."</p>

<p>"New York," said Rud, "is the greatest Jewish city in the
world."</p>

<p>"You think ahead," exclaimed Chiffan in warm approval. "You
certainly think ahead. Mind you, Jews are not always easy to work
with. They're as <i>clever</i> as anyone could wish, but they've
always one foot in the Ghetto."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about Jews," said Rud compactly.</p>

<p>"You will," said Chiffan...</p>

<p>And so discoursing, elaborating in common a magnificent reverie
of revolt and power, our two young men, with their heads pleasantly
swelled by these imaginative exercises, and their confidence erect,
arrived at the New World Summer School at Wexley and found that
with a little squeezing there was room for their admission.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; III</h3>

<p class="first">They got on very well at Wexley. They had much to
say, and Wexley found it fresh and lively stuff. Things there had
been going rather slackly. The school had been feeling the need for
new blood. And here it was. Chiffan saw fit to play the r&ocirc;le of
impresario, an admirable impresario, for Rud. Chiffan too was made
of imaginative stuff. He was elaborating his own reverie about Rud.
Rud's peculiar type of ugliness attracted him. He conceived himself
as a sort of deferential elder-brother tutor to this new
acquisition. He knew just when it was time for Rud to speak, he
advised him quite sagely about the temper of the place, suggested
lines of action, talked about him loyally behind his back and set
the school remarking Rud's exceptional quality.</p>

<p>The New World Summer School was a fair sample of the continually
increasing chaff of mentally unsettled people that was being
winnowed out of the social order by the advancing disorganisation
of the period. It was a sort of lodgement of wind-driven minds in a
cranny of the Yorkshire hills. They had one thing in common, an
enthusiasm for progress. The New World Society was pledged to
progress in any direction, to anywhere, and to any idea about a New
World its members chose to entertain. It was of all ages above
fourteen and it included everything from barely cryptic nudists to
extremely woolly vegetarians, and from single-taxers to
Douglasites; there were Swedenborgians, Spenglerites, modern
spiritualists, aberrant Fabians, seers and great thinkers, teachers
of all grades, sex-reformers, thoughtful people who listened
intently and never said anything, professional and genuine refugees
from Nazi tyranny, Indian nationalists and one Chinaman of
incomprehensible speech and consequently unknown attribution, who
bowed very politely. The school led a hardy, healthy and extremely
inexpensive life, sleeping crowdedly in austerely simplified
dormitories at night, and eating in tumultuous refectories on
trestle-tables covered with marbled white American cloth by day.
There was much walking and swimming, table-tennis, medicine-ball
and Badminton, and a series of conferences that it was bad form to
cut altogether. There were a number of young women, brightly rather
than over-dressed, who supplied little more than applause to the
discussions, but manifestly appealed and set themselves to appeal
to the pairing instinct of mankind. One or two of them decided to
betray an interest in Rud, but he was wary and unresponsive.
Chiffan after a slight resistance lit up and responded almost too
much.</p>

<p>Rud never discovered who was running the assembly. There was a
secretary, an anxious-looking spectacled lady of the head mistress
type whose name he never learnt, who stood up and made
proclamations and stuck up notices, and there was an omnipresent
white-bearded old gentleman in a state of earnest inactivity, who
may have been her husband. And there was something that met
somewhere called the Committee. The essential interest for Rud were
a score of nuclear individuals, who did seem to be trying to shape
out some sort of ideas about the current world drama and the r&ocirc;les
they might have to play in it. Chiffan made rapid and quite
plausible estimates of their quality and Rud concentrated upon them
to learn and impress.</p>

<p>It was not that he was indifferent to the sexual stir that was
going on around him. Indeed he was acutely aware of it, but his
habits and instinct in these matters were becoming increasingly
solitary and secretive. He did not like to give himself away to a
fellow creature even amorously. He made no advances and no
responses. He wouldn't go near the bathing-pool or look a girl in
the face if he could help it. He was acutely jealous and at the
same time contemptuous of Chiffan's gallantries and of all the
other scarcely masked love-affairs in progress.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he showed off as brilliantly as he could in the
meetings.</p>

<p>Mainly the newcomers summarised and decanted what they had
discussed during their four days of interchanges. There was an
earnest ex-ophthalmic little man with a black beard and an
uncontrollable feather at the back of his head who had swallowed
the Douglas gospel whole and apparently digested some of it. His
mind ran on certain definite rails, and if an argument knocked him
off them he just picked himself up and put himself on his rails
again. He had already been making Social Credit unattractive by
dragging it in as an irrelevant topic and so disorganising other
issues, but Rud, talking across the table at supper, seemed to take
a fresh sort of hold upon the question, and the little man, when it
came to his turn to give a conference, was pleased to find an
unexpectedly full room awaiting him. He did not realise at first
that he was to be the victim at the feast. He read a paper that
most of the School had already heard in fragments several
times.</p>

<p>Chiffan sat and listened with a growing admiration while Rud,
who had had only the most rudimentary and casual ideas about the
whole business three days ago, now not only repeated but expanded
and filled in and rounded off what he had picked up in their
conversations. Chiffan watched the bulging forehead and the
pugnacious profile with an almost parental interest and kept up a
<i>sotto voce</i> endorsement to the sentences that came clear and
emphatic from Rud's determined mouth.</p>

<p>"You can't deal with money questions in this way," said Rud in
the magisterial tones of one who had studied the subject for years.
"You can't do it like that. Before you can begin to talk about
money you must settle in your mind what you mean by
property&mdash;for money is only a ticket for property&mdash;and
before you can talk about property you must have made up your mind
about the social system you want. How much private property is
there to be? What can be bought? What can be sold?"</p>

<p>"Hear, hear!" became audible from Chiffan.</p>

<p>"In a theoretically complete socialism, it goes without saying,
the only property you will be able to buy will be consumable goods,
and the only way you will ever get hold of money will be as
anticipatory or current or deferred wages. It won't matter whether
it is cash down or cash held over because there will be no
interest."</p>

<p>"Dole?" said someone.</p>

<p>"Dole is just vacation wages," said Rud. "It's the duty of the
community to find a man work."</p>

<p>"Hear, hear!"</p>

<p>For a time the assurance of his manner carried the meeting. Then
objections arose.</p>

<p>A young man from Belfast, Figgis, raised the issue of foreign
trade and started an excursus about the Workers' International.
That and one or two unfamiliar phrases promised trouble for Rud,
but Chiffan, to whom no current political phrase seemed unfamiliar,
came to his help and pulled the debate back within his reach.</p>

<p>That was Rud's d&eacute;but. After supper nine or ten of them sat and
talked round him for a good three hours, they talked of "Socialism
in our Time," and the talk went wide and far. "Socialism," said
Chiffan, "has got to rejuvenate itself. Prewar socialism was
sentimental and insufficient. He and I have been talking about that
for days. Socialism's got to dot its <i>i's</i> and cross its
<i>t's</i>. Marx ran away with it and lost bits as he ran. It never
understood money."</p>

<p>"What I told you," said the ex-ophthalmic young man with the
black beard. "Exactly what I told you."</p>

<p>Next day a well-trained Marxist from the Black Country, named
Bennet, took on Rud with considerable vigour.</p>

<p>"All this sneering at Marx," he opened, "I don't know who
started it..."</p>

<p>It was a live discussion and once or twice Rud felt himself
cornered, and broke through with some effective rhetoric.</p>

<p>"Talk every time you can," said Chiffan late that night and with
the manner of a trainer. "It's all you can do here."</p>

<p>"As long as they listen," said Rud.</p>

<p>"They'll listen to <i>you</i>," said Chiffan.</p>

<p>Rud displayed no gratitude for Chiffan's aid and support. He
took Chiffan as a matter of course. He was always to take Chiffan
as a matter of course. He trusted him, he relied upon him; he
expected everything from him and gave nothing in return. He took
credit to himself for everything Chiffan taught him or told him to
do. That was Rud's way with life and it worked very well for
him...</p>

<p>When Rud was disposed to guy the Swedenborgian's account of the
Master as Socialist, Chiffan kicked him on the ankle.</p>

<p>Afterwards Rud discussed that kick with some heat. "Never
ridicule a man except for a definite party purpose," said Chiffan.
"And then <i>kill</i> him. Guy him so that he will never rise
again. But don't make an enemy of him for fun...Oh, yes, I know I
do. But I'm different."</p>

<p>Two tepid discussions on "Agriculture in a Socialised World" and
"The Nationalisation of Mineral Products" were instructive rather
than provocative for Rud, and Chiffan did most of the talking. Rud
began to realise that the level of information in the School was
higher than he had assumed. Several of these non-university men
were much better read than he was.</p>

<p>Things livened up to flaming reality with a discussion of
pacificism and non-resistance.</p>

<p>"Are we to Use Force and if so How Much?" was the question
mooted, and before the two days' debate had lasted for an hour Rud
realised that hitherto he had consistently shirked this particular
and very fundamental issue in political affairs. In his reveries of
a stupendous political ascent there had been great marches and
demonstrations, flag-waving and cheering, there had been battles
(heard off) and tremendous displays of armament, thousands of
planes in the air and the like, but so far the rougher stuff had
always been fairly remote from his person. Once or twice he had
been under fire in dreamland, undismayed and unscathed. When he had
imagined himself arrested and put on trial, it had always been an
open trial, numerous reporters present, the whole world wondering,
the judge cowed or secretly sympathetic, and himself practically in
control of proceedings. Prisons, concentration camps, domiciliary
visits, disappearances and secret examinations had been far beyond
the actual margin of his picture.</p>

<p>But now, in clumsy and distressful speeches, in broken sentences
and broken English, came harsh reality, at first hand, One of the
refugees had been crippled and broken. He limped. He clung to the
chair in front of him as he talked. "Even here," he said, "among
friends, one hesitates to tell."</p>

<p>He spoke admirable, bookish English, slowly, carefully and with
a German flavour rather than a positive accent.</p>

<p>He told them of the foul indignities that men, when they
encourage instead of discouraging each other in cruelty, can put
upon their victims. "And your martyrdom," he said in a faded voice,
"is in vain. Your courage is wasted. You suffer and you are hidden
away and lied about. Your persecutors are more horrible than apes,
because they are subtler. Beasts and disease and accidents can
cause men pain and misery, but such things do not torment you with
hope and snatch it away, they do not caricature and disgrace you as
well as destroy. They do not leave your friends in doubt whether
you have betrayed them. They do not make those you love vanish
without a trace or put them to pain and indignity before your eyes.
I did not know it was in my fellow creatures to do such things as I
have seen&mdash;such things as I have been through. Let me tell
you&mdash;I will tell you&mdash;a part of it. What happened to me.
If I <i>can</i> tell you..."</p>

<p>It was a hideous and circumstantial tale he had to tell...The
speeches of the inexperienced which followed seemed helplessly
feeble and pale. It was difficult to listen to them with that man's
story fresh and vivid in the mind. Then came a woman recounting at
second-hand, but no further off than second-hand, the
frightfulnesses that had happened to her family.</p>

<p>Rud wished he could go out of the room; he felt inadequate. His
self-satisfaction evaporated.</p>

<p>He wanted to get up and say: "Stop all this! What do you imagine
<i>we</i> can do."</p>

<p>A little old Jew from Vienna suddenly jumped up with a great
discovery. "I vill tell you someting. I vill tell you someting. A
Magna Carta for the whole vorlt. No force except in the hants of
<i>disciplined</i> men. Vell paid, vell fed, vell cared for,
disciplined men, with officers who know exactly&mdash;vat dey may
do. And go no more beyond. Exactly. Yess. No wappens. No munitions.
Noting. Except for them. And <i>no secret police</i>. No force used
out of sight ever. No dossier&mdash;or if there must be dossiers, I
do not know, but if there must be dossiers, then every man the
right to know exactly what you hold against him. Right to inspect
and protest. And no secret examinations. No. Wherever there is an
examination, then gif me a sort of people to be able to walk
through the room, at any time, able to say, What's dis? What you
doing? A sort of people able to go through all these things. Valk
in. Doctors, mind or body&mdash;all controlled&mdash;in their
examinations. Visitors. Guardians of men. See? A Magna Carta. Until
you haf that. Always there will be darkness and abominations.
<i>Always</i>&mdash;to the end of the vorlt. Better law and order,
I tell you, even if it is bad law&mdash;then lawlessness and evil
in the night. For by night, louts, hooligans touch hell&mdash;you
haf heard&mdash;and rejoice in it. I know. I know. Always, always
gif me <i>law</i>."</p>

<p>His face was flushed. His bright eyes glittered with tears of
excitement.</p>

<p>"Gif me my Magna Carta. Then&mdash;you need not bother.
Everyting will be all right. No force, you understand me, no force
to be used on anyone except in the hants of <b>disciplined</b>
men&mdash;"</p>

<p>He went right through what he had said already almost word for
word.</p>

<p>He repeated his speech with variations three times and was
resuming, <i>da capo</i>, when the chairman overwhelmed him with
clock and bell. Whereupon he sat down, sat very subdued for a
minute or so and then twisted himself round and began to explain it
all in harsh whispers to the people immediately behind him. "My
Magna Carta for all the vorlt. No force, you understand me..."</p>

<p>Rud sat in his place during the outbreak of this little old Jew
from Vienna, digesting the ugly realities those other two refugees
had retailed. They stunned him so that for a time he could not find
anything to say. The thought of violence filled him with angry fear
and the urge to savage reprisals. He felt just as he had felt when
he read of gorillas and wolves in his childhood. The shadow of it
lay plainly across the path of his imaginations. What the little
old Jew was saying meant nothing to him. What stirred his
imagination was the thought of himself being treated brutally and
filthily, mutilated, subjected to sub-human indignities.</p>

<p>"Get your blow in first," he thought. "Nothing else for it.
Always carry a gun. Carry poison."</p>

<p>When at last he spoke, he raged against Nazis and Fascists, he
spoke of the little ways of the British police with mobs and
repeated rumours that came out of prisons. He was all for vehement
reprisals.</p>

<p>"Never forgive a bully. Mark your man down," he said, "and wait
for him. Even if you have to wait for years...</p>

<p>"You've got to attack. Your only safety lies in attack. Choose
your moment for attack. Strike first at the devils, strike
first."</p>

<p>His voice became a scream.</p>

<p>"<i>Easy</i>," whispered Chiffan.</p>

<p>The meeting was divided. There was still a rather shaken
minority for non-resistance, but most of the men and nearly all the
girls were with Rud, for fighting and fighting bitterly. But the
refugees said little and the little old Jew shook his head and
whispered. "If you had my Magna Carta," he whispered.</p>

<p>That night the summer school talked long and late and loud. "And
well we may," said Chiffan, "for, after all, violence is the
fundamental thing in life. As old as hunger and earlier than
lust...</p>

<p>"Before there was even a beast; before a single animal came on
land, there was this attacking and defending, devouring and
fighting for life. If you think you can escape by being lambs, ask
the wolf."</p>

<p>"There's such a thing as Mutual Aid," said the ex-ophthalmic
man. "Kropotkin said that ages ago."</p>

<p>"Mutual aid," said Chiffan, "but only to fight better."</p>

<p>"Force you <i>must</i> have somewhere," said the little old Jew.
"There's only peace under the power of the law. No peace for man
but that. In <i>my</i> Magna Carta..."</p>

<p>"How about bed?" said a voice.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; IV</h3>

<p class="first">Rud and Chiffan sat on a stile on the hillside
above the summer school on their way to the junction. "Time we
went," Chiffan had said, "before they start packing. Then they'll
have time to miss us and talk you over."</p>

<p>He had announced this decision quite suddenly and they had paid
up and slipped away without farewells.</p>

<p>They proposed to go by train to Baiting, where there was trouble
brewing in the minor gadget factories. Chiffan wanted to see it for
himself and he also wanted Rud to see it. The stile tempted Chiffan
after the long path uphill and maybe there was something else,
pulling at him.</p>

<p>"You can't expect anyone to say good-bye," he remarked, "who
doesn't know you're going...<i>You're</i> not impulsive, Rud."</p>

<p>Rud had nothing to say to that.</p>

<p>"It was a good time anyhow," said Chiffan.</p>

<p>"I've never talked so much in my life," said Rud.</p>

<p>"Or to as good effect...of course&mdash;. It's a <i>gentle</i>
crowd. They're&mdash;how shall I put it?&mdash;they're flimsy
people. They're not the stuff revolutions are made of. But they
polish up revolutionary ideas. If it came to a real show-down with
violence, they'd vanish like a heap of dust in a cyclone. All the
same it's a good school for talking. I'm glad we came. But we had
to quit before we caught their disease."</p>

<p>"Ugh?"</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i> Enervation of the intelligence.</p>

<p>"Too many ideas and no conclusions to them&mdash;like a plague
of Manx cats on the brain."</p>

<p>He dismissed that thought and came to something else, that had
evidently been brewing in his mind for some time.</p>

<p>"You know, Rud, you could be vetted into a pretty tidy leader.
Into a very useful leader indeed for a live new movement. You've
got real passion. You speak uncommonly well."</p>

<p>Rud had felt that something of the sort was coming. He had felt
that for some days. He had already thought out his reply thoroughly
and cunningly.</p>

<p>"It isn't impossible," he said, "I believe I might make
something of a figurehead and something of a foghorn, but I
shouldn't be any good, Chiffan, unless there were <i>men</i> in the
ship behind me. And one man in particular..."</p>

<p>It needed no ceremony to bind that tacit treaty.</p>

<p>"I think," said Chiffan presently, "we ought to keep in touch
with Figgis and Redwood. There was something <i>in</i> those
chaps."</p>

<p>He was already organising, imaginatively.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; V</h3>

<p class="first">They pursued their way and their several lines of
thought. "I doubt if I got hold of the women," Rud reflected.
Chiffan roused himself from profound calculation and gave his mind
to Rud's question.</p>

<p>"The women?"</p>

<p>"I doubt if I got hold of them."</p>

<p>"You did exactly right about them. I wish I had your
self-respect."</p>

<p>"I don't think I touched them."</p>

<p>"You didn't. And two I <i>mauled</i>. That's where we differ. I
got my face slapped. I'm sorry but I did. It&mdash;it accelerated
my departure. But you just impressed them. That's the difference
between us&mdash;and why I shall never be a leader. I can't keep my
hands off a pretty girl. It's a second-rate quality&mdash;for all
my wit and wisdom. I have to admit it. <i>You</i> kept absolutely
aloof from them. Exactly what a real leader has to do. You were
concentrated on bigger things. 'All the world loves a lover' they
say. Don't you believe it. Not in politics. Supposing you had
started to philander. It wouldn't have been so difficult. That
yellow-haired girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rud had noted the interest of the yellow-haired girl, had felt
it even when he was standing and speaking with his back to her, had
dreamt about her; but he gave no sign.</p>

<p>"You'd have started a lot of jealousy and irritation among the
girls. Even if they didn't want you for themselves, they'd not have
liked another girl monopolising you. And you'd have just come down
to competition with the other men. Every man is more or less
jealous of any man who gets a girl. Even if she isn't <i>his</i>
girl...That's one of Lord Horatio Bohun's disadvantages. He can't
keep his profile and his aristocracy and his touch of sex appeal
out of the picture. Maybe they won't let him...Women disciples are
dangerous animals...If I hadn't felt you were a natural leader for
ten other reasons, I'd have known it from your handling of those
women. Cool. Sure. I was a bit silly out of school, I
admit&mdash;but all the time I was watching you. One or two of them
said things about you."</p>

<p>Rud could not resist asking what they said.</p>

<p>"'He's aloof,' they said. 'There's a sort of mystery about
him.'"</p>

<p>And then Chiffan produced one of those maxims for statesmen that
Rud was beginning to find characteristic of him.</p>

<p>"A political leader," said Chiffan, "to be successful, must
either be an ice-cold bachelor entirely devoid of sex appeal, a
manifest cuckold or the faithful husband of some ugly, unpleasant
or ridiculous woman. Run your mind through history. All history
stands for it. Napoleon, for example; Caesar,&mdash;<i>all</i>
Cleopatra's bunch; Marcus Aurelius; Justinian; Oliver
Cromwell..."</p>

<p>Rud looked anything but elated.</p>

<p>"It's part of the price of greatness," said Chiffan. "And, after
all, it isn't as though you <i>wanted</i> them, Rud."</p>

<p>"No," said Rud, relaxing into his primitive self, "If I wanted
them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Everything would be different," said Chiffan firmly. "But you
don't&mdash;either for show or use. Not even out of rivalry."</p>

<p>He regarded Rud, with his head cocked on one side for a moment,
and then confirmed his impression. "No."</p>

<p>He went on for a time preoccupied with some train of thought of
his own. "Philandering," broke out at last. "Philandering. That's
the matter with most of us intellectuals. We philander with women.
We philander with ideas. We philander with violence...Rud, the real
world is a <i>bloody</i> world, a world of beatings and bruises and
cuts and fights and dead men. And men not quite killed who're sick.
As that Austrian said. Those dying men who were sick in that room.
You heard him? Gods! I can see it still! That's the raw meat of
life. What are ideas alone? Ideas&mdash;ideas are shapes but not
substance...</p>

<p>"That discussion on non-resistance, Rud! Did you ever have a
better show of Ideal versus Real? Elegant sentiments and then
suddenly those actual things that cut like a knife...</p>

<p>"Idealists! Nothing serious in this world was ever settled by
nice little rabbits putting their little votey-poteys into
boxy-poxes and going home again. The next thing you have to get,
Rud, on your way to leadership, is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want you to get too much of it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"A broken knuckle, say&mdash;a tooth knocked out and a black
eye."</p>

<p>A glow of amused animation appeared upon Chiffan's countenance,
a brightening of the eye, a shining effect on the face. It was his
nearest approach to laughter.</p>

<p>"Bloody knuckles, black eyes and continence, Rud. The way of the
leader is hard..."</p>

<p>"I suppose I've got to face up to it," said Rud after a slight
pause. "It's all in the day's work I suppose..."</p>

<p>But that night there was not the faintest intimation of a
yellow-haired visitant for him. Instead he had a disagreeable
nightmare about those two hefty young men in purple shirts who had
come to his room at Camford. But their methods of controversy on
this occasion were emphatic and not verbal. They never made a
sound. They set about doing frightful things to him. He shot them
both dead but they came to life again and he had to keep on
shooting them. They were soon covered with blood, but still they
got up again. He got his back to the wall and woke up screaming
faintly when he had fired his last cartridge and they still came on
nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>He lay awake and was still aquiver. What would have happened, he
thought, if he hadn't awakened? What would they have done? Then as
he got more awake he knew clearly it was only a dream.</p>

<p>He lay staring at a dim ceiling and listening to Chiffan's faint
snore.</p>

<p>"No good running away," he whispered. "They'll dig out all the
rabbits..."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VI</h3>

<p class="first">On their way to Balting they took a day off for a
rest, because Chiffan knew of a little lake where there was someone
who would lend them an old punt. And they would borrow a rod and
line and fish.</p>

<p>"Fish for what?" asked Rud.</p>

<p>"Just fishing," said Chiffan. "Think of all we've got to turn
over in our minds."</p>

<p>It was a very pleasant day indeed, much sunshine and a glowing
stillness upon the lake and upon its great trees. Chiffan's friend
was a gamekeeper by profession and a socialist by resentment and
conviction. He cooked them a mighty meal of rabbit and onions. They
had small beer (departing from their normal austerity) and cheese,
and he relieved himself of much long suppressed radical opinion and
gave them a shakedown in a little outhouse with a fire. And while
he was busy about his work Chiffan did his fishing.</p>

<p>Rud did not even attempt to fish. Chiffan caught nothing, and
for the most part they paddled about the lake, pulled yellow and
white water lilies out of sheer acquisitiveness, or sprawled in the
punt and meditated under a great yellowing horse-chestnut that
overhung the water, and occasionally plopped a conker through its
glassy surface. Chiffan wasn't inclined for talk, and Rud, too, had
a feeling that the bulk of their talking was done. They understood
one another. And in his relaxed state Chiffan reflected upon
women.</p>

<p>"That girl." he said.</p>

<p>"What about her?" asked Rud. "That Lancashire girl, you
mean?"</p>

<p>"I could have had her," said Chiffan.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I didn't. I didn't want her enough."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"And now I do...</p>

<p>"She was a bore. And yet there was something about her...I think
it was her neck attracted me. There was something attractive about
her neck. Damn! I wish I either wanted a woman or didn't. I can't
get her out of my head. Maybe it's the sunshine or that rabbit. And
I made a fool of myself with the other because she piqued
me...You're lucky not to be bothered by these things."</p>

<p>Rud, who was lying on his back in the punt, said nothing, but he
made Chiffan feel his disapproval by wagging his foot as an
impatient cat waves its tail.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VII</h3>

<p class="first">The next day the purposeful life was resumed, and
they went on to study the industrial troubles of Balting. And
hardly had they come into the dingy, winding streets of that town
before they found a shop-front bright with the announcements of a
brand-new political party, the League of Free Democrats; Leader,
Jim Flab. Most of the window was adorned with copies of a handbill
asking and answering the very natural question, "Who IS Jim Flab?"
above the portrait of a cadaverous man of thirty-five or forty with
a skew chin, a forced glare in his eyes and a crooked mouth
featuring an extremity of resolution to the very best of its
ability.</p>

<p>"He is the Leader of the League of Free Democrats," said the
handbill, "Consecrated to the Salvation of this Our England,
P.T.O."</p>

<p>The handbill was printed on both sides, and each side was
exposed alternately in the window. The reverse contained much
further information, which Chiffan devoured, with that exalted
pallor on his face which stood him in the stead of laughter. "Come
and read it, Rud," he said.</p>

<p>Rud joined him. He found something unpleasantly like a burlesque
of his own dreams in Mr. Jim Flab's proposals, but Chiffan did not
seem to observe that. Mr. Flab, it seemed had had an eventful,
noble and indignant career, he had "travelled extensively," seen
the Pope and the President and Hitler and Stalin, been jailed for
political reasons in Russia, Spain, America and Scotland, and was
still in the early thirties, mounting towards his self-chosen task
of national leadership. There was plainly an instinct for rhetoric
in the man, and a large willingness to avail himself of all the
current prejudices, antagonisms and suspicions of the time. He
boasted of Town Councillors, military men, including "a V.C. with
head injuries," several majors, business men and solicitors among
his embattled following, and they had met, he alleged, by moonlight
at Stonehenge, that "original temple of the British spirit," and
there lifting their hands before their faces "according to the
ancient rite," taken the Vow of the Free Democrats.</p>

<p>"We've never thought of a vow," said Chiffan.</p>

<p>The League of Free Democrats was still very new. The date of
that profoundly solemn occasion was "the Vernal Equinox" of the
current year. He was attacking the "Reds" in particular "all along
the line," wherever the line might be, and his programme, mostly in
capitals, included Fearless Exposure of Red Plots, Smashing of the
Rings of International Financiers, Britain to be Strong and
Fearless, Kicking out Party Hacks and Old Gangs, the Revival of
Simple Christianity, National Plan to Abolish Unemployment and so
on and so forth.</p>

<p>Chiffan read these projects over in an appreciative whisper.
"Pretty comprehensive," he remarked, and then: "Oh! look at this.
<i>'Lack of finance and lack of speakers are our chief
difficulties.'</i> Chance for you, Rud! <i>'We want one thousand
pounds to found anti-red combat groups all over industrial
England.'</i> Combat groups, eh? Lovely. Vows! Combat groups!"</p>

<p>"It's wild," said Rud.</p>

<p>"It's not a bit wild."</p>

<p>"But who's going to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lots maybe. You mustn't suppose, Rud, this chap doesn't know
what he's up to. This is the stuff to give them, he thinks, if you
want to be a Leader. Consider him as a reporter. He's got something
to tell us, Rud. He's a very useful reporter on the state of the
country. He talks to crowds that answer back, while you, so far,
have just talked in your Union. And back there at the summer
school. This stuff has been tested by cheers. He's been heckled.
He's gone home and thought out answers. And that stuff is what
goes...Would-be leaders of his kidney...All over the country
they're breaking out like spots on a boy's face. Competition. We
aren't going to have it all our own way, Rud. And the Colonel
Blimps are rolling up behind him..."</p>

<p>Chiffan considered for a moment and then moved towards the door
of the shop. "Come along," he said.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I am going in."</p>

<p>"The man's a blatant bosher."</p>

<p>"He's not. He knows exactly what he is up to. Master Jim Flab is
no fool, whatever else he is. I want to feel his bumps. I want to
find out who pays for all <i>this</i>."</p>

<p>"But what are we to say?"</p>

<p>"<i>You</i>&mdash;nothing. You just listen for once."</p>

<p>In the shop there was a counter with some piles of handbills,
walls draped with primitive flags of black and red (the League
Flag), a large photograph of Stonehenge framed in wilted laurel,
enlargements of the inspiring likeness of Jim Flab, and in charge
of it all a lumpish young man drowsing over a cross-word puzzle. He
stood up with a start and made a hasty and uncompleted movement as
if to take up something hidden behind the counter. Possibly a
weapon. He decided that was unnecessary. "Whad you <i>want?</i>" he
said.</p>

<p>"Enquiring souls. Camford men both of us," said Chiffan,
annexing a university for himself. "Long Vacation. Seeing England.
We're sick of the Reds and all that, and we want to hear what your
leader has to tell us. He seems good stuff."</p>

<p>"He <i>is</i>," said the lumpish young man. "But he isn't here.
You can see the Major."</p>

<p>"What Major?"</p>

<p>"Major Fitz Blessington. Sit down there, will you..."</p>

<p>After the delay of ten minutes which the importance of the major
necessitated, they went upstairs to a large shabby room over the
shop, in which there were letter files and card indices, odd tables
and windsor chairs, a book-case of reference books, a telephone,
packages of stationery, a small safe, a rack of what Chiffan
suggested later were hose-pipe bludgeons, a row of clothes-pegs
bearing a number of berets and two waterproofs, the portrait of the
Leader over the empty cast-iron fireplace, and a large map of
England marked with blue and red wafers. In the centre was a
writing-desk of painted and grained wood, littered with papers and
with the apparatus and litter of a slovenly pipe smoker, and at
this desk sat a small but sturdy little man with a hooked, red nose
and a tumult of chins in full retreat, dissimilar blue eyes, a
moustache as wild as an excited Persian kitten and a pipe in the
corner of his mouth. He was dressed in a shabby old khaki uniform
from which all badges and indication of rank had been removed, and
diagonally across his chest was a black and red scarf after the
fashion of a French mayor's. He pretended to be busy with important
documents.</p>

<p>"Sit down, my lads," he said, pointing with a pen. "I'll be
through with this stuff in a moment."</p>

<p>Chiffan made to examine the map of England.</p>

<p>"Siddown," said the major.</p>

<p>Rud and Chiffan disposed themselves in free and undisciplined
attitudes on two of the windsor chairs. "Mm. Mm. Mm," said the
major, and slapped a folder on his desk. "And now let's have a look
at you, my boys."</p>

<p>He came round the desk towards them, leant against it and
contemplated them. There was a smell about him as though his
uniform had recently been cleaned with benzine and his breath
enriched by whisky. It came to them through the rank smell of his
pipe, and there was also a flavour of leather and something else
that was probably idiosyncrasy&mdash;altogether a thoroughly manly
smell. People with leftish prejudices might conceivably have said
the major stank.</p>

<p>"So you want to join the Free Democratic party," he said. "Good
for you."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether we do," said Chiffan. "We want to hear
about it first."</p>

<p>"You'll soon hear about it, my boys. All England is going to
hear about it before very long, by God. <i>You</i>'ll hear about
it. You're sick of the Bolsheviks and the white-livered peace
skunks and the Jews and all the rest of 'urn. You want to do
something about it, and you've found your way to the right place.
We're out to clean up England. Jim there is the man for us. He's
the man for us and the man for you. He's <i>white</i>. True-born
English, a pukka democrat, if you understand me, and straight as a
die. You ought to hear him. It's grand. It's grand."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Chiffan in a digestive tone. "And you started all
this&mdash;these new ideas&mdash;this spring?"</p>

<p>"At Stonehenge, with a bit of a ceremony. <i>And</i>, my
boys&mdash;and don't you forget it&mdash;a prayer to God. Whom
you've all been pretending to forget. Jim Flab hasn't forgotten the
Old Book."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you start before?" asked Chiffan.</p>

<p>The major replaced his pipe, with which he had been making
generous circular movements indicative of the greatness leading and
sustaining the party, in his mouth, and he spoke about its stem
with a snarl that set his moustache flying high and wild, and
revealed a wealth of irregular yellow teeth. "Because we've given
those other slackers and humbugs rope to show their quality. That's
why."</p>

<p>"Meaning old Bohun and his purple shirts?"</p>

<p>"Meaning, sir, whomsoever it may concern. To hell with posturers
and posers, say we! We start free and clean."</p>

<p>"I suppose people are just pouring in on you?"</p>

<p>"By the hundred. The people of this country know a good thing
when it's offered them. They've waited long enough, God knows. We
can't keep up with them&mdash;taking their names. We put out our
Programme. Here it is&mdash;if you haven't seen it. 'Join us and
fight for us' we say, and that's enough for them."</p>

<p>"I see that," said Chiffan. "There were five or six hanging
about outside when we came in."</p>

<p>"<i>No!</i>" cried the major. "Where?" and went to the window,
so evidently astonished, that Chiffan was able to convey a solemn
look of derision to Rud.</p>

<p>"I don't see 'um," said the major, turning back.</p>

<p>"Shyness, I expect," said Chiffan.</p>

<p>A faint suspicion passed momentarily across the major's
countenance. There was a pause. "So you wish to join us?"</p>

<p>"There's trouble in the Balting shops, I'm told," said
Chiffan.</p>

<p>"<i>Fomented</i>," said the major.</p>

<p>"It always is. And you're doing something about it?"</p>

<p>"Balting men must deal with Balting men."</p>

<p>"You mean?"</p>

<p>"We're running Bolsheviks and paid agitators out of the town. We
give 'urn notice to quit. That's our particular task here,
<i>if</i> you want a job with us. We saw Mr. Harry Bellows off the
premises the day before yesterday."</p>

<p>"Stand all right with the police?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Supe is heart and soul with us."</p>

<p>"Supe?" said Rud.</p>

<p>"Superintendent of Police, my boy."</p>

<p>"And the Town Council?"</p>

<p>"Fifty-fifty. There's some rotten radicals and pink parlour
Labour men. But we've got good friends on the bench. Good sound men
and good sound patriots."</p>

<p>"And half the strikers are girls? More than half, Major? Not
much chance for <i>them</i>. If you cut off help from outside."</p>

<p>"What's that got to do with it? Eh?" The major was suddenly on
the defensive again.</p>

<p>"Trying to get things clear in my mind," said Chiffan.</p>

<p>The major removed his pipe from his mouth, walked across the
room and spat with an air of extreme deliberation into the empty
fireplace. "Look here, my lads, what do you think you are doing
here? Joining up&mdash;or smelling round?"</p>

<p>Chiffan stood up and Rud followed suit.</p>

<p>"It doesn't smell so fresh," said Chiffan.</p>

<p>"Get out, you scabs&mdash;you Bolshevik spies," said the major
with concentrated intensity. "I've wasted my time on you."</p>

<p>"We were only enquiring."</p>

<p>"<i>Get</i> out," said the major. "D'you hear me? Get OUT." He
made truncated gestures of assault. He was transparently disposed
to kick. Rud felt himself going white.</p>

<p>The major caught Rud's eye. An eye like that might mean a knife
or a pistol. The major abandoned his impulse for immediate
violence. "Get out&mdash;before I blow my whistle."</p>

<p>The departure was wary and stiff. Chiffan led the retreat. Rud
kept a watchful and dangerous eye on the major and went downstairs
sideways. There was tension but no actual violence.</p>

<p>The major continued audible above in abusive soliloquy.
Apparently he had risen from the ranks, a promoted drill sergeant
of the old school...</p>

<p>The young man in the shop had clutched a truncheon, but
apparently only for self-defence.</p>

<p>"That," said Chiffan, when they were in the street again, "was
as plain and diagrammatic as you could have. You didn't say much,
Rud, but I guess you didn't miss much. This town, you see, is a
nest of small factories making bits of things; half the workers are
girls and kids, and helpless as mutton. The law protects them, but
who cares for the law here? The employers are cowardly sweaters,
and they think that industrial discipline is cheap at the price of
Jim Flab and that major and the few casual roughs they have
enrolled. It isn't; but they think it is. And so Jim works himself
up, half rogue, half dreamer&mdash;such dreams as <i>we</i> dream.
While the major sells the stuff."</p>

<p>"Such silly stuff," said Rud.</p>

<p>"Silly stuff, you think? P'raps no more silly than ours. P'raps
less. Wait till war gets nearer and the bombing and shooting
starts, wait till the people above begin to have that
back-to-the-wall feeling...Same as these sweating magistrate
manufacturers here have...Then you'll get it all&mdash;magnified.
The big people will come in. They will put guns in the hands of
chaps like that, put bombs in their hands, teach them the authority
of a uniform, set them to suppress strikes...Put them at last in
control of things...After which they will get out of hand. It was
stinkers like that little major who ran about in Ireland during
those ugly years, Black and Tans versus rebels. You don't remember.
I just do. Gods, the foolishness of the Tories to touch such muck!
So they lost Ireland. So in the end they are going to lose
everything they ever clutched under God's sky. There's hundreds of
that dirty little beast&mdash;ex-temporaries&mdash;looking for
gangster jobs now. The last war bred them like maggots in a dead
dog. The next war will breed thousands more.</p>

<p>"I'm glad we went in. That's the sort of thing ahead of you,
Rud, like a dangerous back street at night, and there's miles of it
that you'll have to go through before you can even begin to get
that successful feeling...before you can dare to dictate peace and
plenty in good earnest...before you can feel independent enough
even to start our great programme&mdash;and put out that Strong
Right Arm of yours..."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VIII</h3>

<p class="first">"It all gets into the boiling when you come to a
revolution," said Chiffan. "You can't even make a garden without
slinging mud. The raw material of politics. What is it? Mud, blood
and fools. There's nothing else...What have you been dreaming
about, Rud, if you haven't faced up to that? That's the stuff of
life for our generation&mdash;leaders or led, bleeders or bled. Our
feet are set on the path of revolution. The stars in their courses
insist. There's no turning back. But I'll tell you, Rud, who I
would rather be than any dictator that ever lived."</p>

<p>Rud asked "Who?" as he was plainly expected to do, though he
knew nothing rational was coming.</p>

<p>"Omar Khayy&agrave;m," said Chiffan. "Yes&mdash;old Omar. Bless him! I
am a revolutionist by conviction but I am a poet by nature...That
loaf of bread, that jar of wine. And the sunshine of the
desert...</p>

<p>"As for 'Thou beside me in the wilderness' I should want an
occasional change. Like the books of a circulating library. But I
suppose I should begin with that girl with the neck..."</p>

<p>"There are times, Chiffan," interjected Rud, "when you talk like
an ass, like a Priapean ass...I don't like it."</p>

<p>"And I have devoted myself to making a great man of you," said
Chiffan with a monstrous sigh. "It's true, Rud. I've found my job
in life. And when they try to shoot you&mdash;I shall
be&mdash;behind you. No avoiding it. There won't be any Wilderness
to go to in the Wrath to Come, and they'll have burnt the vineyards
and slashed the wineskins."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; IX</h3>

<p class="first">Rud returned to Camford at the end of the Long
Vacation very nearly if not quite a grown man. In every life cycle
there are phases of swift development alternating with intervals of
comparative unchangeableness; there comes a time when the child
almost suddenly becomes a boy and again at adolescence when
puerility falls off in a few amazing days, like a cloak suddenly
abandoned. So now in a brief tale of weeks, Rud had passed from the
phase of dreaming youthfulness and begun to assemble himself for a
purposeful attack on life. He spent the last two days of the
holiday at home, and his mother saw with unspoken satisfaction the
change wrought by that six pounds ten of hers in his voice and eye
and bearing. Where he had been defensive and irritable he was now
tranquil and resolute.</p>

<p>"All that fresh air has done him a lot of good," said his
father.</p>

<p>But she felt that it was more than fresh air had happened to
him. What it was she could not imagine. His development followed
laws of its own. She knew exactly how Aunt Julia would account for
it, and she knew quite certainly that Aunt Julia would be
wrong.</p>

<p>So she said nothing about it to Aunt Julia.</p>

<h2><a id="book2" name="book2">BOOK II. &mdash; THE HATCHING</a>
</h2>

<h2>I. &mdash; THE GROUP ASSEMBLES</h2>

<h3>&sect; I</h3>

<p class="first">One brilliantly sunny morning two years later
found old Doctor Carstall in his dressing-gown, sitting in a
capacious wicker chair in his garden, lost in thought. His
devastated breakfast tray was on a rustic table beside him, and
various letters, circulars and a couple of morning papers occupied
a second wicker chair within arm's length. A waste-paper basket had
been put conveniently for his envelopes and wrappers.</p>

<p>On his tray lay a letter and an original paper, a reprint from a
scientific publication, by his son. The paper was entitled
<i>Certain Relations between Nervous Strain and General
Metabolism</i>, and the letter explained:</p>

<p class="letter">"This is a sort of premature birth brought on by
the Crisis. Some of the most interesting threads lie loose. I meant
this research to be an epoch-maker, but what will you? All my work
is interrupted&mdash;for Heaven knows how long. I've been grabbed
by the National Nutrition Emergency Committee, damn it. How the
devil research is to get along under this sort of thing I can't
imagine. The Committee is fundamentally futile. But there's no
escaping it."</p>

<p>Two headlines of the crumpled newspapers were visible. One
proclaimed a "Further Slump in Industrials," and this had suddenly
brought home to the doctor that his tenure of this pleasant
red-brick house and this garden in which he had expected to spend
his declining years, was now extremely insecure. If he hadn't sold
his practice so soon it would have been better for him. And if he
hadn't bought United States Steels. No good fretting about that
now. Anyhow, Dick had had his start, and not even the N.N.E.C.
could rob him of that now.</p>

<p>The second newspaper, at which the doctor had scarcely glanced
as yet, was being emphatic about "The Fight for the Purple
House."</p>

<p>"Damn the world," said the doctor, and began filling the pipe
that for reasons of economy had replaced his former customary
cigar. "Nothing is safe any longer. Nothing is steady. I could have
bet my life on those Steels."</p>

<p>He smoked slowly, and presently his breakfast tray was carried
indoors.</p>

<p>There seemed no end to this slump. No end at all. He found
himself going over the steady development of the world peril that
had thrown its shadow across the security of his morning sunshine.
How had it begun? He recalled the follies of the victors in the
Fatuous Twenties, the gathering resentment and bitterness of the
losers in the war, and the wave of pacificism that preceded the
armament race of the Frightened Thirties. How obdurate France had
been, how ambiguous England! How futile the League! He recalled the
Great Peace Ballot of 1936 which had passed like the sigh of a
sleeper reluctant to awaken.</p>

<p>Then had come, not formal war, all declared and set, but a
gradual decline into warlike violence and destruction all over the
world; Abyssinia, Spain, China and Japan, Macedonia, Syria, the
social disorder in the Cotton States, the Ukraine business, Brazil,
the Argentine, Ireland, and now these ever-spreading troubles in
India. Everywhere there appeared the same phenomenon of unemployed
and discontented masses of young people milling about in
revolutionary movements; everywhere demagogues rose to exploit
them, everywhere the gangsters fought more openly, everywhere were
shrinking markets, mounting taxation and monetary inflation,
conscription for military service, conscription for
munition-making. The formulae of the gangsters varied from extreme
leftism to extreme rightism, but the material facts were everywhere
the same. Governments everywhere were afraid to declare war
definitely or to restore an effective peace, because so long as the
military necessity ruled there was at least an excuse for
unqualified repression. It made one's mind fret and ache to open
the morning paper.</p>

<p>Civilisation as he knew it, was going to pieces.</p>

<p>He thought of the world before the Great War and it seemed a
Golden Age. In those happy days a man lived his own life, and
politics were no more than a noise off-stage. Government was as
remote and benign as the sky. You went about nearly all Europe then
without a visa and you talked with absolute freedom wherever you
went. Your personal liberties were rational and immense, you could
do anything short of violence to frustrate the government, and when
you earned money it meant you had that much money&mdash;less a
slight diminution of pay for the roads and the policeman. You could
invest and assure your future and provide freedom for your children
after you. And all over the world a pound was a pound. Of course
the poor were poor then, but were they any better off now, except
that they felt their poverty more acutely? The subject races were
subject and equally unawakened. Life had some dignity then in a
decent Englishman's home. Art was subservient and not subversive,
its mission was to please and evoke a feeling of complacent
approval, and literature, as free as it is to-day, had infinitely
better manners. Philanthropy, real charity indeed, prevailed
remarkably.</p>

<p>It had been a good secure time for a quite considerable number
of gently-living people, and all about him, all his world, had
assumed that that really very good life was getting better and
better, carrying a higher polish and spreading out steadily to an
ever-increasing proportion of the population. Presently the whole
world would be gentle. And no one dreamt that this expanding
civilisation was being undermined and outgrown, was living on its
moral capital and wasting its abundant material resources. That
pleasant world of his in which he had been born and which had
seemed so permanent and settled, had been indeed hardly more than a
passing gleam of sunshine upon the overcast, stormy, incalculable
stream of life. It had seemed to be the normal course of life.</p>

<p>How rare indeed are such patches of sunlight in history! Now and
again, in China, in Greece, in Egypt, in Japan, in the early Roman
Empire maybe, in a few cities in the Middle Ages and rather widely
through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, there had been
phases of well-bred, humane, cultivated living, free talk and
liberal behaviour. Gentlemen and their womenfolk had walked the
world without weapons and lived in pleasant comfortable houses.
Gardens had multiplied and men of his type had sat in them, secure
in their dignity. Surely wherever you find a cared-for garden you
have a symbol of goodwill and well-being in life.</p>

<p>Probably, thought the doctor, few of my sort of people who have
lived this life have realised, what I am beginning to realise, that
ours is not the normal life of man. Over vast regions always, and
for long ages even in the favoured lands, our sort of life has been
impossible. True that in a few half-illuminated regions there has
been a sort of penumbra to our civilisation, little gleams of
comfort, refinement and loveliness, cringing in courts or carried
on precariously behind high walls and locked doors. But the rest
had been blackness, the blackness of natural violence, the black
struggle of the brute to survive and triumph. A general blackness
leaves no books or pictures or traces behind it; only the bright
phases are remembered. The old proverb is wrong. Unhappy is the
breed that has no history. In all those vast unlit intervals, the
life of man, just as much as the life of any other animal, has been
red in tooth and claw, suffering greatly and signifying
nothing.</p>

<p>Am I growing old? questioned the doctor, or am I beginning to
see reality plain?</p>

<p>Never before had it dawned upon him, how flimsy was
civilisation, how limited and incidental and flimsy it had always
been.</p>

<p>"A few precarious patches of civilised life," whispered the
doctor, "a few decades here, a few there, and before and behind and
around and beyond that an animal&mdash;that craves, that cowers and
is beaten. <i>Homo vapulans</i>. And back to that we go.</p>

<p>"<i>Burr!</i>" he said and knocked out his pipe.</p>

<p>He sat polishing the bowl of his pipe in the palm of his hand.
His eye fell on Dick's letter and paper.</p>

<p>He recalled that talk they had had at the beginning of the Long
Vacation. Two&mdash;three?&mdash;no, two years ago. Before that bad
bout of neuritis had set his mind towards thoughts of senescence.
Fine chap Dick was, but a little strange. So like and so intensely
different from himself. They had had a long talk...</p>

<p>The doctor had hoped the boy wouldn't be disturbed in that
psycho-visceral work of his, but the rising tide had got him. The
tide of disaster was coming in faster than they had thought...</p>

<p>They had discussed this breakdown towards war and disorder. Dick
had been very strong on&mdash;what was it?&mdash;the idea of
"scavenging ". All this present disorder in the world, he had said,
was the breakdown and clearing away of outworn creeds, dynasties,
classes, nationalism, bad industrial organisation, bad monetary and
financial methods. Possibly&mdash;Oh! Probably&mdash;it was so. But
what had Dick to put in the place of all this debris when the
scavengers had taken it away? There was no doubt we were going to
have the ruffians and scavengers, no doubt at all now, all over the
world they were busy, hyaenas on the battlefield, wolves following
the retreat, but who were these other fellows, where were these
other fellows Dick had talked about, who were going to take hold of
things and set up the great modern scientific world-state of our
dreams and hopes? That was where Dick had become mystical.</p>

<p>What was it he had said? Something about a lot of tacit fellows,
with a common clear-headedness. Secret natural
aristocrats&mdash;something like that. Yes, he had the words now, a
World Civil Service, based&mdash;that was it&mdash;a World Civil
Service based on a World Public Opinion.</p>

<p>"But my <i>dear</i> Dick," said the doctor, addressing his
absent son aloud, "how the devil do you propose to get a World
Civil Service based on a World Public Opinion when all the good
school-masters and mistresses have been beaten to death, when all
the universities have been turned inside out and filled with
bullies and subservient professors scared out of their wits? When
all free publishing is over. I ought to have said it that night,
only we got on to something else..."</p>

<p>He nodded his head.</p>

<p>The fact of it is, he reflected, Dick makes up that story in
self-defence. It's just self-protection from the reality of the
case. It's the reckless optimism of youth. He wants to get on with
his work&mdash;and very pretty work it is, too&mdash;and not be
invaded and wasted by politics. He is shirking the issue because it
is too complex and disagreeable to face. That is how it is; that is
how it has always been with these scientific men. Dick has invented
these phantom natural aristocrats of his, this imaginary new breed
of mankind, who would all know each other and exactly what has to
be done when the time comes; he has invented them, just to save
himself from the distraction of political things. And so until the
ultimate smash-up overtakes him, please don't bother him.</p>

<p>"<i>It's not good enough, Dick.</i>"</p>

<p>Something occurred to the doctor. He decided to smoke another
pipe on it. He had a faint memory that he too had been rather
bitten at that time by that idea of a better sort of men appearing
on earth.</p>

<p>A nice easy way out of our troubles. Here comes the Super Man,
the Super Man; the Super Man! He'll see to it. In the nick of
time.</p>

<p>Things weren't going to happen like that...</p>

<p>For the stresses of the new world we wanted a new education.
Such a lot of people were saying that and still doing nothing about
it. If we had only realised that thirty years, twenty years, ago.
<i>Then</i> Dick's World Civil Service, which was to be
indispensable for successful dictators whether they liked it or
not, and his World Public Opinion which would be unavoidable if you
are to have the education for an adequate Civil Service, might be
something more than dreams. But now?</p>

<p>Wasn't all that too late now? Too late? The world was becoming a
warfare in fragments. There might not even be great dictators any
more, no wide-reaching Caesars like the early Caesars, but only a
succession of little bloody men who would come and go, little
Francos and Francolets, getting baser and less civilised step by
step. And if that was so, there would be no intellectual revival
now, much less a great educational reconstruction, and no effective
World Public Opinion anywhere. That World Civil Service was a
dream...</p>

<p>"Pessimism of old age?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>"But isn't it so?"</p>

<p>Enough of this thinking! Who had enough knowledge for prophecy?
No one. We had to take the blows as they came. Maybe it wasn't
going to be as bad as it looked. Not so bad as all that. Maybe he
was missing some hopeful possibility...</p>

<p>"And now for the morning's disasters!" he sighed.</p>

<p>He picked up a newspaper and read: "The Fight for the Purple
House. Political Monkey&mdash;Lord Horatio or Rud Whitlow."</p>

<p>"Whitlow?" he repeated. "Now where have I heard that name
before? <i>Rud</i> Whitlow?"</p>

<p>A small recalcitrant white-faced boy appeared scowling before
him. Of course he <i>had</i> gone up to Camford! On some
scholarship. There had been talk of speeches he had made...</p>

<p>"That infernal little beast!"</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; II</h3>

<p class="first">The two years that followed his encounter with
Chiffan had been crowded with experience for Rud. He had come up
again to Camford with a greatly enhanced self-confidence. Chiffan
had inflated and confirmed and strengthened him enormously. A
certain shyness in making personal contacts had diminished. He
began to expect things from people, to demand them and get them.
His revolutionary conviction increased. He knew the world was in a
phase of revolution and that inevitably he had to play a part in
it. He talked now to fellow undergraduates and even to young dons,
very much as Chiffan had talked to him. He took a first class in
his stride though he did not get a fellowship. Then for a while he
felt his progress checked.</p>

<p>He came down, he found himself at home for a time without a job
and the vaguest of plans. He got some lecturing in a London college
and took mean lodgings in a back street in Bloomsbury. His assured
income, he found, was less than in his scholarship days, and in
London poverty is more obvious and galling than at Camford. He
added to his income by writing a book for a publisher fortunately
affected by the series mania, and by doing a little reviewing of
sociological and historical books. For the better part of a year
his political prospects ran along cramped, unpromising lines.</p>

<p>But nevertheless he had supporters now and a sense of reality
about his activities. At first he had been disposed to conceal
Chiffan from Camford; he did not want Camford to notice how much he
owed to Chiffan; then he felt the need of him and got him to come
up for a week-end of talk with the new associates. They had formed
a discussion circle and Chiffan came as their common guest. He did
much to confirm and develop their impression of a certain large
flexibility about Rud's imagination, his capacity for political
enterprise and the political effectiveness of his storms of
passionate speech.</p>

<p>Now after a phase of loneliness, doubt and depression in
Bloomsbury, Rud found his friends turning up in London and resuming
their Camford conversations with him. One of his most steadfast
supporters was a rich young man named Steenhold. Steenhold was half
American and he was in his middle twenties. He had come up to
Camford explaining himself rather copiously; he did not want a
degree, he had said; he did not need a degree, but he wanted to
learn; he wanted to see what Camford had for him. He wore strange
clothes, he drank excessively and then took to living on carrots
and water, he tried poetry of a mystical inaccurate sort; he got as
far with art as investing in a painter's outfit, he tried on a
purple shirt but stuck at Jew-baiting, he was drawn to "Guidance"
for a while, he was a member of the Communist Party for a
fortnight, and then he decided that what Camford had for him was
Rud. And he settled down to be Rud's disciple with a quite
unprecedented steadfastness. He liked in particular the idea of a
common revolutionary movement in Britain and America. He displayed
a strange prophetic insight. "Rud's real," he said. "Rud's going
far."</p>

<p>He established himself in two large flats in Camborne Square
just out of the Euston Road. In the upper one he lived, in the
lower he set up a sort of headquarters for Rud and such Rudites as
were gathering round him. He refreshed them with a sideboard
bearing bread, which they cut for themselves, cheese, carrots,
plentiful carrots, apples, bananas, cider, water and beer. The
cider and beer were in casks, and there were blue chequered
earthenware mugs but no plates. The floor of this lower flat was
covered with cork carpet, bathroom and kitchenette included, and
the walls of its four rooms were adorned with a disorderly
collection of election posters, caricatures and very modern
pictures with a political bias. There were chairs, forms, a settle
or so, two sofas, five or six folding beds, a spinet and several
tables bearing piles of old newspapers, and warmth was supplied by
electric radiators and light from cornice lights and casually
placed reading lamps.</p>

<p>A queer miscellany of people drifted into this place. It had
points of resemblance to the crowd at the summer school, but there
was a greater reality about it. There was a sprinkling of young
scientific workers, there were rising and ambitious artists, there
were unusual-looking young women who were models, there were
incidental, bright and excessively usual-looking American girls,
some rather encumbered with disconcerting mothers, there were
journalists, the secretaries of one or two politicians and various
peculiar friends of Steenhold's too diverse and irrelevant to
describe. There were fewer school teachers, and pairing
arrangements played but a minor r&ocirc;le in the interests of the
company. Here Rud would sit in a corner and talk and improve his
talking powers. The political atmosphere was much more various than
the unchallenged, uncorrelated progressivism of the summer school,
and he learnt to parry and deal with a number of new points of
view. He learnt with a sort of angry reluctance&mdash;he would
rather he knew without this learning&mdash;but he learnt
continually. He was moody; he was often manifestly sulky; he seemed
to feel a smouldering hostility to many of them; and yet the
discipleship of Steenhold infected most of the crowd. Occasionally
his brain seemed to light up and then there could be no doubting
his originality and vigour.</p>

<p>His onsets of political clairvoyance took him by surprise almost
as much as they surprised his following. He had little
introspection; his disposition was to be consistent and always
right, and he passed from phase to phase almost unwittingly. At one
moment he would be sullen, rather angry, disinclined to speak, with
a cloudy confusion of facts and impressions, things he had heard,
partial suggestions he had never tackled, old reveries and present
impulses swirling about in his brain, and then suddenly like a
crystallisation, everything fell into place, with a conviction, an
absolute certainty of rightness and fitness, and with it came words
and phrases, coherent, continuous. Life, which had been like a
dispersed jigsaw puzzle, appeared then as a stateable and
manageable problem, and the only astonishing thing about it for him
was that it was not as clear and compelling to everyone as it was
to himself. It was as if some different intelligence, a sort of
parasitic lucidity, was hidden in his brain, with contacts and a
range that went far beyond his personality; it was a genius he had,
a genius in the Socratic sense, like that of a musician or a
calculating boy or a poet. It seemed not to affect his general
character at all.</p>

<p>Gradually he became aware of the alien nature of this mental
being within him, and shaped his conduct to exploit it. Generally
he would sit in a corner drinking little and smoking less, and
waiting. It became a leading interest to "get Rud going ".
Sometimes when he had a feeling of inadequacy, he would stay away
for days at a time, so as not to spoil the impression he perceived
he was creating.</p>

<p>He would sit in a corner under a chalk caricature of himself
that one of the artistic contingent had made. It was on brown paper
and the forehead was exaggerated and done in white. His normal
scowl was exalted to intensity, his eyes were alight, and he raised
one eloquent fist to the level of his forehead. It was one of those
brilliant caricatures that seem to exercise a moulding influence
upon their originals.</p>

<p>Since the war scares of 1937 and 1938 the process of world
armament had been going on with an ever-increasing intensity and an
ever-increasing stress and dislocation of the ordinary life of
mankind. Everyone now was being regimented, enrolled, enlisted,
taxed beyond all reason, intimidated. If a new world was being
born, it was being born very uncomfortably. A feverish exacerbation
of human consciousness was manifest under these conditions. Overt
criticism was dangerous and suppressed, but doubt and unbelief
gathered intensity through their lack of expression. One dogmatism
destroyed another and was in its turn destroyed. Everything was
being openly accepted and furtively questioned. No tacit assumption
and no established institution was safe from this seeping away of
belief. A mean superficial cynicism spread like a miasma over every
land.</p>

<p>Compared with any former period in human history the second and
third decades of the twentieth century saw a stupendous diffusion
and ferment of ideas round and about the earth. The only approach
to a parallel is the intellectual, moral and religious confusion of
the world that occurred between the break-up of the ancient
localised paganisms and mythologies and the onset of the first
syncretic, universalist experiments, Christianity, diasporic
Judaism and Islam. And that was an infinitely fainter and slower
mental turnover. One instance marks the difference in tempo and the
change of scale. In the eighties of the nineteenth century,
communism was the imagination of an obscure group of exiles in
London. Marx wrote his articles in Highgate and made a scanty
living, and young Mr. Bernard Shaw, after speaking, chiefly for his
own amusement, at a little meeting in Hyde Park, was accosted by an
unrecognised stranger who proclaimed himself: "I am Friedrich
Engels!" It did not seem to be anything very wonderful in the way
of an encounter at the time. Engels indeed struck Shaw as a
needlessly self-important person. "O-o-oh!&mdash;<i>Engels</i>!" he
said, with the rising inflection of surprised enlightenment. Yet
within thirty years there was not a country in the world, from
Quito to Lhasa and from Greenland to Papua, where the names and
doctrines of Marx and Engels were unknown; and communism and the
doctrine of the class war were as widespread as Christianity and
far better understood. It was a diffusion ten times as rapid as the
former instance&mdash;and with a vastly greater range.</p>

<p>One evening Rud found himself eloquent upon this point,
rephrasing&mdash;and greatly improving&mdash;some of Chiffan's
remembered wisdom.</p>

<p>"Revolution so far!" said Rud. "Bah!...</p>

<p>"Just class bickering, rows in the street, changes of
management! The mere beginnings...</p>

<p>"The real revolution," he went on, "is still going about the
world like a mighty spirit seeking a body. For a couple of
centuries now the world has been troubled by needs that have never
once found a suitable working expression. All the time the stress
has been getting worse. Life gets more unbalanced, more dislocated,
clumsier and more abundant. Then tension of population increases.
More and more people suffer. Pointless, silly, bloody warfare!
Pointless, silly, bloodless unemployment! This real revolution
going about the world&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like an evil spirit," said one of the models.</p>

<p>"No! A great spirit, a monstrous spirit beyond good and evil,
resolved to embody itself somehow..."</p>

<p>Steenhold murmured approval. "Beyond Good and Evil," he thought.
"Nietzsche! <i>Good!</i>"</p>

<p>"I tell you," said Rud, becoming more and more prophetic in his
manner, "social trouble has been growing and growing, ever since
civilisation began to use money and roads and ships. All the
religions, all the loyalties of the past three thousand years, are
just the childish palliatives, the insufficient clothes, the
<i>shapes</i>, men have tried to impose upon this growing
monstrousness to prevent it from disorganising life too
frightfully.</p>

<p>"And it's growing now&mdash;faster than ever&mdash;always more
intolerant of these shreds and patches, these <i>Gulliver
strings</i>, we put about it."</p>

<p>"Gulliver strings?" queried Steenhold, and then with delight:
"Oh! <i>Gulliver strings</i>, tying him!"</p>

<p>"Yes, tying him," said Rud. "The real revolution, mind you, will
never endure these limitations&mdash;not for another ten years.
'Damn you,' it says to us, 'clothe me <i>properly</i>, equip me
properly!' I am the Age of Plenty, I am the new life. The new world
is getting impatient. It is a new life&mdash;absolutely&mdash;and
it wants the shape and it wants the endorsement of a new life.
Communism wasn't enough for it. Not nearly enough. A mere feud of
existing classes. The new world <i>has</i> to burst all these
racial and national and class ideas, Fascism, Judaism, Nazism,
Sovietism, by which people are trying to incarnate it. It is
bursting them now. They are being tried and found wanting. All of
them. They were all experiments. All experiments.
Temporary&mdash;to the last degree. It is the turn of our
generation, of <i>our</i> sort, now, to try and fit the case
better. It has come to us, now. <i>Now!</i> NOW! We have to solve
the problem or go down in our turn. Go down! And every generation
that goes down will go down heavier. There is no fury like a
revolution frustrated&mdash;no disorder like a world in which a new
pattern of living has failed to realise itself."</p>

<p>"Now that's <i>real</i> stuff, Rud," said Steenhold. "That's
real live stuff. That goes on to something. That goes on."</p>

<p>"<i>But</i> I don't <i>quite</i> see..." began a spectacled
Bloomsbury intellectual, sitting on the floor and nursing his
knees.</p>

<p>"I tell you, he's <i>fine</i>," shouted Steenhold, quenching the
intervention. "Let's have more of it, Rud. Tell us some more."</p>

<p>"That's the gist of it," said Rud.</p>

<p>He was trying to remember exactly what he had said. He himself
felt he had said something fine. It was like his first outbreak of
eloquence at the Union all over again.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; III</h3>

<p class="first">To these conferences in the Steenhold flat there
presently came a bunch of young men from Lord Horatio Bohun's once
hopeful Popular Socialist Party. At first they argued with Rud, and
then they crystallised about him. "But this is our stuff," they
said.</p>

<p>"No," said Rud, "it's what your stuff ought to be. If it had
more bones and less white meat."</p>

<p>They were ripe for Rud. The spirit of their movement was
changing, and they realised the need for a renewal of its vitality.
They were growing up mentally, and the idea of being thoroughly
disagreeable to Jews and long-haired communists no longer satisfied
them as an objective in life. They no longer flaunted it in
decorative purple shirts because the wearing of party uniforms was
now rather heavily penalised, and that loss of colour also was
reflected in their bearing.</p>

<p>The biggest of them was a man named Rogers, some sort of amateur
boxing champion, with a streak of almost maternal protectiveness in
him and a bias for a good clean vigorous fight. He did not mind
very much what the fight was about, and he hated to think it might
lead to bad feeling. Bodisham, another of them, seemed to be a born
director; he would have been an able producer of films or plays and
he played chess and was said to play bridge with a swift, uncanny
realisation of how the game was going. Later on he was to justify
his reputation and become a brilliant controller of meetings and
party manoeuvres. And he was to end as one of the greatest of
constructive statesmen. Rud perhaps had a quicker grasp of a
general situation, but it was instinctive, not reasoned; Bodisham's
turn for either massed details or isolated details was not to be
equalled. And when it was a question of the scientific handling of
a problem, Rud gave way to Bodisham perforce. Bodisham had come out
of the London School of Economics; his first ambition had been to
supplement the mental deficiencies of Bohun. When he had found that
they were not to be supplemented, he had turned to Rud. He was the
only one of the Group who wore spectacles; it seemed to accentuate
his claim to be the intellectual influence in the party. Irwell
came in from a stockbroker's office. He was living by sub-editing a
financial paper, and when he talked of money the others listened
with respect.</p>

<p>Another of this bunch was a man whom Rud had a haunting sense of
having met before. His name was Colin Dreed. At first Rud could not
think where they might have met, and then he identified him, though
not with absolute certainty, as one of two purple shirts who had
visited his rooms in his second year. Dreed perhaps had an
equivalent doubt, and at times Rud would catch a slight perplexity
in his eyes, an expression of inadequate recognition. But nothing
was ever said about it. Dreed was now nearly an adult and no longer
that bright potential furniture-smasher of Rud's second year. But
he was still essentially a partisan. He did whatever he was told,
and he always did it with a faint suggestion of surprise at not
having thought of so obvious a thing himself. But he never thought
of it himself. One or two other purple shirts and ex-purple shirts
came less regularly and talked less freely, but these were the
nuclear personalities of what was destined to be Rud's primary
organisation.</p>

<p>It was evident to him that all these young men were extremely
dissatisfied with Bohun's leadership, and that they did not know
clearly what to do about it. They felt misdirected and frustrated,
and yet they still retained something of the good intentions that
had brought them into his movement. Many years ago Lord Horatio had
come into British politics with a considerable flourish, as a young
man of wealth, position and influence, destined to play a
brilliantly unorthodox r&ocirc;le in public affairs. He had also
evidently proposed to himself a wide conspicuousness as a splendid
individual. He had narrowly escaped the House of Lords; his brother
was the Duke of Wybrow, a defective so defective as to be unfitted
for anything but procreation, in which indeed he had been eminently
successful. So Horatio, cut off from any hope of a dukedom and a
senatorial career by a growing zareba of nephews, had decided to be
the British Julius Caesar; the Duce, the leader of a renascent
patriotic Britain. Plus Byron without the limp. At first everything
seemed to favour him. There had been only one insurmountable
obstacle to his ambitions, but that was hidden from him, a complete
lack of originality in his make-up. He was so completely destitute
of ideas that he had no idea he had no ideas. He behaved therefore
as though he had ideas, and for a time there were admirers to share
his illusion.</p>

<p>He had been what is called a "spoilt" child, the favoured
younger brother, and he was still essentially "Lord Horry". He had
one of those faces whose features seem asymmetrical and confused
when seen in front, but which have a certain resemblance to
handsomeness in profile; he was pale, freckled and red-haired, with
the rebellious forelock so frequent with romantic personalities,
and his voice was arrogant and adenoidal. He carried himself with a
certain solemn haughtiness, breathing heavily, with a projected
chest balanced stiffly against a projected behind. At first he had
proposed himself as the rising hope of the Liberal Party; but in
those days very little was left of the Liberal Party except rising
hopes; many of them were already middle-aged, and they had shown
very clearly that an addition to their numbers would be unwelcome.
He was an imperious rather than a patient wooer, and so he had
transferred his proffer of leadership almost convulsively to the
Communist wing of the Labour Party.</p>

<p>Here again his reception was inadequate; the Labour Party did
not seem to realise in the least what an accession this splendid
and brilliant young aristocrat would be to its all too pedestrian
front, and while he was still reluctantly realising this poverty of
the leftish imagination, the successes of Mussolini and the Nazis
gave a new turn to his ambitions. He became the sedulous student
and ape of the Italian and German adventurers, not realising that
there was a certain incongruity between their methods and formulae
and the peculiar large scepticism of the Anglo-Saxon tradition,
with its lamentable disposition towards facetiousness on serious
occasions. What was more natural than for the rejected romantic
leader of the Reds to invert himself in another swift
transformation, become an anti-Red, and stretch out his strong
right arm to protect the rich old ladies of the land from the Red
Horror? They responded to his heroic gesture with copious
subscriptions and profuse press support. Lord Thunderclap and all
the <i>Daily Clarion</i> group of newspapers hailed him with
enthusiasm. He was speedily in a position to provide headquarters,
highly decorative purple shirts, brown belts and a sense of purpose
to a perceptible following of unemployed young men. So far as the
police would let him&mdash;and at first they let him quite a lot if
only on account of his rank&mdash;he organised a series of
demonstrations against the Reds, and he induced the Jews to
advertise him by a campaign of annoyance and menace against these
far too responsive, expressive, tactless and unendearing
people.</p>

<p>So it was Lord Horatio after his abortive explorations of the
alternative avenues to the Left of life, made his definitive
entrance upon the political scene from the Right. No further
transformation was possible for him for there was nothing more for
him to copy. He was now past the first blush and beauty of youth,
and he found himself in a bright limelight of expectation. For a
time&mdash;indeed until the dynastic trouble about the Duke of
Windsor in 1937 superseded him&mdash;the first question the
travelling Englishman was asked was "What is this new man, Lord
Bohun, going to do?"</p>

<p>To which the more intelligent Englishman said: "He isn't much of
a man and he isn't going to do anything."</p>

<p>"But that's what they said of Hitler."</p>

<p>"But Hitler was a national growth, and Bohun isn't even a
growth..."</p>

<p>What the less intelligent Englishman said about him varied, and,
anyhow, it does not matter now.</p>

<p>There he was upon the British scene in a nimbus of expectation.
He took large halls and addressed meetings at which he regurgitated
the masticated leading articles of the opposition press&mdash;and
more particularly those of the <i>Daily Clarion</i>. He never made
an original remark, he never coined a phrase of his own, not even
by accident. He organised processions, which had a diminishingly
irritating effect, in Jewish districts. Nothing ever ensued from
the meetings and processions except a dribble of police court
proceedings that died away. Then he would pass out of the headlines
for a space and then again would come another great and entirely
vacuous meeting and another temporary obstruction in the
streets.</p>

<p>Slowly, incredulously, the world realised that Lord Horatio was
doing nothing, and did not know how to do anything. But he kept up
his movement with all the dignity of Tristram Shandy's bull.</p>

<p>He was too vain and jealous to associate any original or
vigorous intelligence with himself. Helpful people of initiative
and ambition joined him, only to drop off disappointed. Instead he
gathered about himself parasitic adherents of impeccable dullness,
and he organised a wonderful "training school" of Popular Socialist
speakers. They were given little books of pros and
cons&mdash;remarkable pros and cons&mdash;and general advice. But
it is hard to train men to meet the unexpected interruption. These
trained and paid supporters did not so much speak at his meetings
as imitate speaking. They learnt the sounds and gestures of
demonstration and conviction, but nothing more. They brought down
the emphatic fist upon the suffering palm in the vain hope of
giving platitude the flavour of inspiration, and a few determined
interruptors could make a dreadful mess of them.</p>

<p>Sometimes Lord Horatio was out of the papers for weeks at a
time, and then he would be back again, delivering the same old
speech and demonstrating nothing by the same old demonstration. He
was especially prevalent in spring. May and June seemed to excite
him. It looked as though he was destined to become a seasonal
feature in English life, like the Royal Academy or the Boat Race.
Whenever there was a socialist or pacifist or communist gathering,
or indeed any sort of mass meeting, the purple banners of the
Popular Socialists with their golden tassels turned up in slowly
dwindling force, always under almost excessive police protection,
and always making a scuffling rather than triumphant exit from the
field of debate.</p>

<p>The nimbler years slipped by, and even his loyalest adherents
were forced to realise the progressive ravages of middle-age upon
his former fatuous&eacute;lan. His pogroms, such as they were, lost
pep. The <i>Daily Clarion</i> ceased to feature him. It did not so
much turn against him as fade away from him. It looked as though he
and his Popular Socialists were going to sit down and fade out
altogether. This sessile disposition on the part of their leader
was a source of grave discontent to many of the youngsters who had
got into belts and purple shirts and broken their adolescent voices
shouting "We <i>want</i> Bo-oo-un" in those so much more promising
early days. More and more he had to rely on the subsidised element
in his following. More and more did the growing tension of the
super-armament period emphasise his essential unreality, his
amateurism.</p>

<p>At one or two of his recent meetings unidentified and
disregarded voices had cried out "Get <i>on</i> with it!"</p>

<p>The world situation darkened. The sense of impending catastrophe
increased. All over the world it was felt that the now-or-never
moment was approaching. There was a sort of paralysis of grim
expectation. In 1940 the chief employment of human leisure was
anti-aircraft drill; a quarter of a million bombers were in
commission, and everywhere men excavated. Political life changed
its character. Political thought intensified. The taste for mild
rioting was declining under a burthen of apprehensive
responsibility. The newspapers bore anxiety on their foreheads.</p>

<p>The publics in the old democratic countries had had the
educational spectacle of a decade of blustering dictatorship in
Europe. They were capable now of immense scepticisms and
increasingly resistent to the vague promises of merely personal
leadership. "You are anti-Bolshevik and anti-Jew, you declare the
government is corrupt and incompetent and so forth, and that's all
very acceptable," said the mind of the common man. "But what are
<i>you</i> going to make and what are <i>you</i> going to do if we
put you in power?"</p>

<p>Beneath Bohun's feet, at his headquarters, the germs of a
"Ginger Group" stirred and grew. Out of deference to his ruddy
forelock it called itself "<i>Real</i> Ginger". It desired a
programme, a creed. It desired explicitness. It took a definite
form in Steenhold's flat one evening when, after a dissertation of
Rud's, certain letters of power, namely, "B.M.G." were pronounced.
Which letters being interpreted signified no longer "Balfour must
go" as they had originally done&mdash;but "Bohun". And the man who
said them was Rogers.</p>

<p>He hit his knees with his fist, he said the mystical letters and
glared around him.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; IV</h3>

<p class="first">The talks in the Steenhold flat had benefited
considerably by the accession of Chiffan. He had returned rejoicing
to London, having got a job as printer-editor of a small suburban
newspaper, and he brought with him much precise information about
the gathering unrest in the North. "They despise and hate the
government more and more, but they don't know how to set about
changing it. The country is dying for some sort of lead, and so far
all it is getting is a crowd of fresh professional leaders. Who
never get anywhere. Who do not seem to be aiming anywhere. We are
living in world of <i>jaded</i> politics. Poverty increases, prices
rise, unemployment spreads, mines, factories stagnate, and nothing
is done."</p>

<p>At first Chiffan was wary and a little jealous of Rud's Popular
Socialist friends, and also, quite inadvertently, he developed an
earnest and sympathetic friendship with a frizzy-haired, amber-eyed
young woman who had been regarding Rud very earnestly for some
weeks. (They began by talking about Rud, his gifts, his character,
his possibilities, and their devotion to him brought them closer
and closer together, and at last so close that Rud became a
benediction over their liaison. Chiffan made a sort of party
sacrament of it, but for all that he was rather ashamed of himself.
The relationship excited and occupied him for a week or so, and
then it bored him, and when Rogers smote his knees and said
"B.M.G.", he lit up and became a fount of shrewd suggestions.)</p>

<p>"B.M.G. <i>Great!</i>" said Chiffan.</p>

<p>"B.M.G. <i>Great</i> idea!" said Steenhold.</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of B.M.G.," said Rud, nursing his knee in his
corner. "I agree that the Popular Socialist organisation has to be
given a new start and a new programme&mdash;it's what I've been
saying all along&mdash;and as things are, it is probably the only
organisation in the country on which you could base a real
efficiency campaign outside the party machines. There it is. It is
the only quasi-voluntary organisation just now that could take
liberties and not be suppressed at once. The left organisations
now, if it came to a scrap, could be shut up in a week. It's the
Popular Socialists for us or nothing. But why shouldn't one keep
Bohun as the nominal head and work through him?"</p>

<p>"You don't know him yet," said Bodisham.</p>

<p>"I've got to see him. We join up to-morrow, Chiffan and I. I
told you. When I see him I shall know better about him. What is
there impossible about him?"</p>

<p>"Wait till you see him," said Irwell.</p>

<p>"He has personal contacts with the West End and the City."</p>

<p>"Had," said Bodisham.</p>

<p>"The sort of immunity this Party has had&mdash;it certainly
<i>has</i> had an immunity&mdash;may vanish if we chuck out
Bohun."</p>

<p>"That depends on the opinion the authorities have of us," said
Bodisham.</p>

<p>"There are three reasons why B.M.G.," said Chiffan, "so far as I
understand the situation. Firstly he will never let any sort of
initiative exist in the party except his own, so long as he remains
the leader. And he has no initiative of his own. Secondly, the only
way the public can be made to realise that the Popular Socialist
Party is now going to mean something else, is by not simply making
Bohun <i>go</i>&mdash;but by chucking him. And thirdly we have to
publicise Rud. That is the most important. We have to stage a
first-class row, so that Rud's restatement of our ideas will be on
the front page. We've got to put him there and keep him there. What
do you think, Bodisham?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't be sounder," said Bodisham.</p>
r&ocirc;le

<p>"I'd like to hear more suggestions," said Rud. "We've talked
to-night. We've talked before. We can't always be talking. Now if
this Real Ginger Group of yours is to go beyond talking it has to
define itself much more plainly than it has done. We must know what
we really mean to do and we must have some ideas of the r&ocirc;les we
have to play. It is no good, for example, for Rogers to yield to
his burning desire to go right out now and hit somebody, unless the
Group is prepared for the situation that will arise out of the
hitting. If I am any sort of leader&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you <i>are!</i>"</p>

<p>"Then the first thing is that nothing must be done until the
word Go&mdash;Nothing. For ten days or so at least we have got to
meet here and draw up almost detailed particulars of what we mean
to do. We have to sound everybody concerned. Now we happen to be
alone here to-night, but generally speaking this room is too
public, Steenhold. On Saturdays it's half Bloomsbury and stage
here, in the small hours. Anyone may come in at any time."</p>

<p>"Well, make a planning-room of my room upstairs," said
Steenhold.</p>

<p>"And definitely plan," said Bodisham, and took off and wiped his
spectacles with an air of preparing for work.</p>

<p>So they definitely planned and became an organised conspiracy.
They elected themselves and were chary of introducing fresh blood.
They drew up certain articles of association beginning: "The object
of the R.G.G. (Real Ginger Group) is to resuscitate, revise,
enlarge and invigorate the Popular Socialist movement and make it a
Living Power in the Land." Their imaginative organisation of the
group proceeded apace, and everybody weighed everybody's character
and capabilities and limitations with the utmost solicitude.
Chiffan ticked them off with semi-official titles. Rud was the
Master Director or "Chief" for short, Rogers was the Fighting
Chief, Bodisham was the Organiser General or the Head Strategist,
Irwell was the Financial Reorganiser, Dreed was the Chief of
Propaganda and Education.</p>

<p>"Everything has to be stated," said Rud.</p>

<p>"Of course! Of course!" said Dreed. "It's all as plain as
daylight."</p>

<p>"Times change," said Rud, "and nowadays they change very
rapidly. Propaganda becomes more and more a primary thing. One
reason why the majority everywhere is so indecisive is because it
is becoming intelligent. It is mobile but sceptical. It won't jump
at a name or a nickname now. It wants&mdash;<i>definition</i>.
Compared with ten years ago it is critical. It has to be given
things straight and clear. But if you give it things straight and
clear&mdash;it <i>can</i> take them and it <i>will</i> take them."
("I do so agree," said Bodisham. "I do so heartily agree.") "The
primary need in order to get and keep power is bright plain
publicity. And more publicity. And then publicity. There never has
been a time when ideas are as fluid as they are now. If only one
can get publicity, if only one can get the ear of the crowd,
anything could be put before it&mdash;anything&mdash;and given
sufficient explicitness almost anything can be put over it. If you
put over nonsense it will fall to pieces later, but there is no
limit now to the changes of opinion that can be affected in the
modern masses. Choose good slogans. Speak loud, speak wide, speak
plain and the thing is done."</p>

<p>(Approval from Bodisham, nodding his head so that his glasses
flashed.)</p>

<p>"Just consider the fluctuation of the popular intelligence in
Britain during the last few years. You had absolute changes in a
year or so. Not changes of shade, mind you, but changes of colour.
Black to white. There was that Peace Ballot business. When was it?
In '36? You had ten or twelve million adults in Great Britain
voting against any sort of war. You would have said that a majority
of the British people and certainly all the left side of British
life would never fight in any war again. And by '37 the whole
country was boiling for a show-down with Italy about Abyssinia, and
by the middle of '38 you got the feeling that the selfsame mass of
people, the same crowd of individuals, was beginning to want a war
with Germany! Really <i>want</i> a war. Getting <i>dangerous</i> to
Germany! Spoiling for it. And now the current slogan is
'Settlement'. The government says settlement, but the people
<i>mean</i> it. What will they mean next year if they are still
being bored to hell, drilling and arming and paying taxes?</p>

<p>"In Germany too, how many Nazis were Liberals and Social
Democrats ten years ago. Yet in '37 and '38 if you woke up a German
in the night he said 'Heil Hitler' automatically, and felt it. Then
they slacked on Hitler. How easily they slacked on him! How rapidly
they developed resistances to the tension, the incessant tension,
he made.</p>

<p>"Look at the way people have swung through Communism, Toryism,
Liberalism&mdash;in vast blocks. In my father's boyhood you were
either a Liberal or a Conservative in England, and there you stuck,
and in America you were a sturdy individualist Democrat or
Republican from the cradle to the grave. But now the Voice does
it&mdash;the pervading voice. And just now it's come to a point
when a Voice&mdash;putting it straight and clear. Straight and
clear..."</p>

<p>"There speaks the Voice," said Chiffan. "You make pictures in
the mind, Rud. I see the mind of the world like Chaos&mdash;a
whirling Chaos, and suddenly comes the Logos&mdash;the Word. In
fact you, Rud."</p>

<p>"You aren't jeering by any chance?" asked Steenhold, always
anxious to know exactly where he stood.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I <i>am</i> decorating a little. It's my vice,
Steenhold...Let us plan."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bodisham. "Let us plan. Now just where do we begin
operations? Where do we first confront the Boss with the unpleasant
fact that the movement no longer considers itself properly led? And
proposes to give him a push? And what exactly will it do when he
splutters and hectors?"</p>

<p>So the conclave in Steenhold's upper room began its
deliberations, began to figure out the definite seizure of the
party for Rud. It was necessarily highly imaginative work.</p>

<p>At times it was entirely indeterminate whether they were really
making plans for definite action or merely indulging in a
collective reverie, that might at any time evaporate back into
nothingness&mdash;as ten thousand other conspiracies have done.</p>

<p>"We now know," said Bodisham, summing up one night, "practically
everything we mean to do. We mean to insist upon a general meeting
of the party and then we mean to challenge Bohun fairly and
squarely. What we have to do now is to fix times and dates,
determine numbers and places."</p>

<p>"Wait!" said Chiffan.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"The Hour. The Moment. Rud's instinct and the word Go."</p>

<p>"Wait, but be ready," said Rud. "Wait for the word. It will be
like shooting a gun and killing a man. After that there is no
turning back. I've seen the Boss once. H'm! I want to give him one
more chance. I want to start with a speech on this mess the
government is making about the American situation. Somehow I must
make that speech."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; V</h3>

<p class="first">When Rud met the Popular Socialist Boss he hated
him, he hated him immediately and without qualification. His
intention of impressing him deeply, winning his confidence,
betraying and supplanting him, was replaced by a vehement desire to
destroy him, humiliatingly, completely and at once. Rud the
political learner, at the mere sight of Lord Horatio, gave way to
the more primitive Rud, Rud the vindictive destroyer.</p>

<p>He had expected to encounter a foolish figure, but he had not
expected to encounter so exasperatingly vain and foolish a figure.
He had thought he was bringing a considerable contribution to the
Popular Socialist movement in the shape of his natural eloquence,
rapid comprehension and gusty energy. He found Lord Horatio
incapable of appreciating any gifts but his own.</p>

<p>Lord Horatio was seated before a great, ornamental,
unbusiness-like desk with a large inkstand and impressive
paper-weights and accessories. He was posed as an
eighteenth-century Whig gentleman. But he was smoking a cigarette
and there was an ash-tray of stubs and a selection of cigarette
packages among the more monumental desk fittings. He was wearing a
frogged purple velvet Tuxedo. His white shirt collar was open to
reveal his neck picturesquely. To his left was a large table
bearing a litter of pamphlets, press cuttings, proofs, memorandum
pads and even books, and looking over this barrier appeared the
upper part of the face of a small, spectacled, woman stenographer,
who had been taking down his Lordship's correspondence.</p>

<p>She rose to go at Rud's entry.</p>

<p>"No, no," said Lord Horatio, with a restraining gesture of an
elegant hand, "we shan't be long."</p>

<p>He had given Rud the benefit of his profile, the ruddy forelock,
the Corinthian nose, the rather underhung jaw. Now he half turned
to face him. The expression of his rather too closely-set eyes was
designed to convey hypnotic penetration.</p>

<p>"Well," he said with a certain condescension. "What do
<i>you</i> want?"</p>

<p>He had made no suggestion that Rud should sit down. Rud had an
impulse to seize a chair and plant himself, but there was no chair.
His scowl intensified. He came up to the desk and stood over Bohun.
He had the infuriating thought that he must look rather like an
under-gardener applying for a situation.</p>

<p>"The Popular Socialist programme expresses very much what I
feel," he said. "I'm prepared to throw in my lot with it."</p>

<p>"That means work."</p>

<p>"What else can it mean?"</p>

<p>"What can you do?"</p>

<p>"Speak."</p>

<p>"Have you been trained?"</p>

<p>"I've debated in the Union with a certain success."</p>

<p>"But in the real world? I said, have you been trained? Our
speakers are trained men."</p>

<p>"If you mean that poor little list of pros and cons of yours..."
For once Rud was at a loss for words.</p>

<p>"Do you fancy you have a platform pairsonality?" said Lord
Horatio. "I wonder. How tall are you?"</p>

<p>There was a pause. If Lord Horatio had not been so occupied with
his own "pairsonality", he might have remarked the extreme
malignity of the face before him.</p>

<p>"I'm two inches taller than Napoleon," said Rud.</p>

<p>"Remarkable! But for platform work you require more than a
coincidence of that sort. You want a definite, commanding
pairsonality. Even I have had to study and drill myself. You have
to <i>dominate</i>. Frankly I think you're too short. But these are
really questions for Commander Hoggin. He is in control of all the
training work. You ought not to have come to me. Who sent you up?
Rogers! Oh! Rogers...I've no doubt Commander Hoggin can see you,
but the first and last thing in a party like ours is discipline and
obedience."</p>

<p>He turned the wonderful hypnotic gaze of the leader full upon
the new adherent, but it did not have much effect on him.</p>

<p>"But do you know who I am?" said Rud. "Do you know what I can
do?"</p>

<p>"Hoggin must see to all that."</p>

<p>For a moment Rud was at a loss. He turned to go and then thought
of something to say. "Why the hell don't you have chairs here for
people to sit down?" he asked. "It's damned uncivil."</p>

<p>He went towards the door.</p>

<p>"One moment, my boy," he heard behind him.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The salute?"</p>

<p>Lord Horatio was standing up and looking very scandalised and
stern and commanding. He had apparently not heard that impossible
snarl about the chairs.</p>

<p>"How? Salute?"</p>

<p>Lord Horatio lifted his hand and Rud reciprocated. Lord Horatio
dropped his hand and so did Rud. Honours were equal.</p>

<p>Then Rud slammed the door and found himself trembling and
feeling sick.</p>

<p>Bohun stood for a time staring at the slammed door.</p>

<p>"<i>We'll</i> lick him into shape, Mrs. Crumb," he said. "We'll
lick him into shape. Yes...By the by, did <i>The Times</i> print
yesterday's letter? Who is it on <i>The Times</i> who makes all
these needless difficulties about my letters? It gets worse and
worse."</p>

<p>But his mind was on Rud.</p>

<p>"Who the devil was that, Mrs. Crumb? I've never seen him
before."</p>

<p>"I'll get him documented, my lord. He joined up only last
week."</p>

<p>"He's quite an untried man?"</p>

<p>"I'll get whatever dossier we have."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VI</h3>

<p class="first">Rud's second encounter with the Boss was if
possible more exasperating than the first. Rud spent four days
turning their first meeting over in his mind, and by that time he
was ready with an ultimatum. He made it without consulting his
associates. He had learnt that Lord Horatio was going to Liverpool
for the week-end, and that there was to be a Birthday Meeting in
the smaller Saltbag Hall there. The American trouble was growing
acute, but the Popular Socialists seemed to be doing nothing about
it. They were plainly wasting an immense opportunity. Rud found
Dreed on duty at the Purple House and he had no difficulty in
making his way up through the lower rooms to the sanctum on the
second floor. He walked in without ceremony.</p>

<p>Lord Horatio was sitting at his desk. He had two documents
before him. One was the final draft of his forthcoming Liverpool
speech which Mrs. Crumb had just typed. The other was what she had
been able to produce by way of a dossier for Rud. He was looking
them over portentously and doing nothing about either of them. The
dossier was the result of confidential enquiries by Captain Smike,
whose duty it was to report upon the internal discipline of the
party to the Boss. The last entry noted that Rud had not yet
discussed the matter of training with Hoggin. In addition, Smike
had some hearsay about Steenhold's flats&mdash;he had thought it
wiser, he said, not to show himself there until he knew that
something was really brewing&mdash;and his chief fact was that Rud
sometimes talked very well and effectively. "No doubt that several
of our older associates think well of him. He has ideas, plentiful
if not sound. He has a certain force. But so far&mdash;just
<i>talk</i>. The rest of that crowd is mostly pink carnations with
a pansy border."</p>

<p>(So Smike. The Popular Socialists were always very loud and
scornful about pansies&mdash;whatever pansies might be. "Carnation"
seems to have been Smike's own original unaided term for a
mitigated "Red".)</p>

<p>Lord Horatio had a way of rolling back his lips from his teeth
and playing imaginary tunes upon them with his finger nails, when
engaged in stimulating thought. "Has ideas?" he said, and was
tapping his teeth and regarding that draft speech of his
schemingly, when Rud burst in.</p>

<p>"What the davil!" exclaimed his lordship. "What do <i>you</i>
want? Where's the salute?"</p>

<p>"That salute!" cried Rud. "Oh! <i>How</i> does it go?" Bohun
fell into the trap again.</p>

<p>"Don't you trouble about a chair," said Rud. "Don't you bother
about a chair. I can say all I have to say walking about the room.
But I must know before you leave London what we are going to do
about the American trouble. Mexico? And the shooting in South
Carolina. Particularly the shooting in South Carolina. It's the
grandest opportunity the party has ever had, of taking a line.
Before the Communists get hold of it. Slap against the government
and with all the natural instincts of the people behind us. What
are we going to <i>do?</i>"</p>

<p>He stopped short and stared at Mrs. Crumb. She had flopped back
in her chair quite audibly. Her eyebrows had risen a full two
inches above the rims of her spectacles.</p>

<p>Lord Horatio was speechless for some seconds. One large freckled
fist rested on Rud's dossier. He looked rather like a public
monument of a leonine character being desecrated by trippers. "You
ask what the party is going to <i>do?</i>" he said at last.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;evidently! Here's exactly where we come in! Where
the government couldn't come in, even if it wanted to. We can put
Washington, Wall Street and Westminster into the cart now and shake
hands right across the Atlantic with the mass opinion in America.
The situation is screaming for it."</p>

<p>Lord Horatio held up a hand.</p>

<p>"Have you come here to make speeches Mr.&mdash;Mr. Whittle-low?
I don't rememba inviting you to do so."</p>

<p>"I don't want to make speeches here, but I want to make speeches
for you in London. I can handle this situation. If you have to go
to Liverpool, well, anyhow let me have the Hyde Park platform next
Sunday. Let me take a line and get a press for the party. I'm ready
to discuss it all with you."</p>

<p>"<i>No!</i>" said Lord Horatio.</p>

<p>"Gods!" cried Rud, in a frenzy, wringing his hands. "But
<i>look</i> at it!"</p>

<p>Lord Horatio was looking at Rud. This sort of thing, he thought,
was what comes of what they called ideas. This youngster was going
to be a nuisance in the party&mdash;probably even a menace. His
effrontery was astonishing.</p>

<p>With an extremity of quiet scorn Lord Horatio demanded: "Are you
the head of the Popular Socialist movement or am I?"</p>

<p>"Should I come to you like this if <i>I</i> was?" demanded
Rud.</p>

<p>"I wonder if we want a man of your stamp in this movement at
all," considered Bohun, still very cold and calm. "Now let me tell
you, my boy, that we know exactly what we are doing in this
American affair&mdash;exactly." He pointed his remarks with an
extended finger. "We have our own sources of information and our
definite policy. You can hardly expect me to confide in a neophyte
like you, what and why and how and when. You've forgotten your
place and you've got to learn discipline. You imagine we have no
Party Discipline. A day may come when you will know better."</p>

<p>Rud was about to speak, but Lord Horatio was standing up. "Now
not a word more of this," he said. "I tell you to go to Commander
Hoggin for instructions and to keep your mouth shut until he tells
you to open it." He reflected for a moment and then laughed
scornfully. "To think of it! <i>You</i> deal with the situation!
<i>You</i> take the Hyde Park platform. <i>You!</i> If you come
here again to annoy me with this sort of thing I'll have you thrown
out of the party. It's only because you're a raw beginner that I
tolerate you now."</p>

<p>"Oh <i>foolery!</i> Oh Stick in the Mud!" burst from Rud, a cry
of agony.</p>

<p>Lord Horatio rapped the desk with a ruler he had seized. "You
<i>rat!</i> You little <i>rat!</i> Salute, Sir, and get out. I'll
tell them how to deal with you."</p>

<p>"Salute!" said Rud. "<i>Me</i>&mdash;salute!", and then,
grinning viciously, "<i>How?</i>"</p>

<p>It looked as though Bohun might lose his self-control, and he
was a full five inches taller than Rud and generally much larger.
Moreover that ruler might serve as a missile! If he thought of
it.</p>

<p>Rud closed the door behind himself and stood quivering on the
landing.</p>

<p>"Damn the idiot!" he said.</p>

<p>Lord Horatio stood very still at his desk, dilating and
contracting his nostrils almost as though he was doing breathing
exercises. Anger illuminated him&mdash;in the eyes of Mrs.
Crumb.</p>

<p>"I was <i>afraid</i>," whispered Mrs. Crumb, all limp in her
chair. "I was afraid&mdash;you might <i>kill</i> him."</p>

<p>"He just wants discipline," said Lord Horatio. "I'll break him
in yet...I've dealt with tougher stuff than that...Have you ordered
the car? <i>Hotel?</i> No. I'm staying with Lady Garbees."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VII</h3>

<p class="first">Rud went out of the Purple House in a preoccupied
manner.</p>

<p>"O.K.?" asked Dreed as he came downstairs.</p>

<p>"No," said Rud curtly.</p>

<p>He felt he had made a mess of the whole situation. He ought to
have consulted the B.M.G.s before this second encounter with Bohun.
He did not want to go back to Steenhold's flat to make premature
explanations to him or any of them, and still less did he want to
return to his dismal little apartment. He felt he could never make
a tolerable story about this paralysing quarrel. He would go for a
walk. He would just walk. He would spend his anger in walking. It
was a mild, clear afternoon and he wandered for miles, first west
until the sunset got into his eyes, and then northward and round by
Hendon and the Northern Heights. He sat for a long time in a
tea-shop in Hounslow, brooding; he got a sausage-and-mashed in a
little pub out towards Barnet. Afterwards he found a friendly
wayside seat and sat on it for some time. Then as his feet were
getting very tired and his small change low, he established himself
in a belated confectioner's shop at Highgate over a glass of soda
and milk, and when that establishment closed he went home,
refreshed himself with a wash and repaired at last to Camborne
Square.</p>

<p>Saturday night in Steenhold's flat was not one of the B.M.G.
nights, and none of the Group was there. Instead there was an
influx of uncongenial spirits, interested in the worlds of dramatic
art and poetry and literary journalism. Many of the people were
quite unknown to Rud, and Steenhold was plainly giving politics a
rest. "How goes it?" asked Steenhold.</p>

<p>"Rotten," said Rud. "I'll have a drink and sit a bit and then go
to bed."</p>

<p>He sat about ineffectively and he disliked the company very
much. The talk splashed about his disregarded sulkiness. He
disliked them more and more.</p>

<p>They were all so <i>irrelevant</i>, so frightfully irrelevant.
The mind of youth is an errant mind and will not always conspire.
It loathes concentration. It flits from novelty to novelty. It must
be fed by events and challenges and held to its objective by
conflict. It puts world affairs on a level with any one of the
minor arts. That night Rud had the completest conviction that
things had slipped out of his hands altogether. He did not talk and
they betrayed no desire to hear him talk; he felt that they were
convinced they had heard all he had to say, and were talking now
about other things, about their damned little plays and pictures
and novels and biology and genetics and time-space and any old
thing of that sort, beyond his peculiar range. He was effaced. He
drank several mugs of beer and smoked more cigarettes than were
good for him, he tried to intervene in two discussions he knew
nothing about, and finally went home stiff and footsore to bed.</p>

PLATFORM</h2>

<h3>&sect; I</h3>

<p class="first">He woke up on Sunday morning in a state of extreme
irritation, or rather, he emerged by degrees from a dreaming
exasperation to an aching discontent. He woke up and stared at his
discoloured ceiling. A realisation of absolute ineffectiveness
overwhelmed him.</p>

<p>"Defeat!" he whispered. "Defeat. <i>Self</i> defeat. Here's the
Popular Socialist demonstration will be petering out as usual in
Hyde Park as if nothing had happened; here's a plain situation
before us that won't wait, that can't wait, and I'm doing nothing.
My guns are spiked.</p>

<p>"What <i>good</i> am I?</p>

<p>"I might as well not exist."</p>

<p>The tension accumulated. It reached the breaking point. He
exploded.</p>

<p>"Oh <i>God!</i>" he screamed.</p>

<p>He leapt out of bed as though some unseen beast in it had bitten
him. He threw his bedclothes into the corner; he gashed his chin
shaving; he kicked his shoes across the room, he quarrelled with
his shabby suit of clothes and broke his only pair of braces. He
made hay of his room in his search for a piece of string or a
safety-pin to repair the damage. Instead of cooking his egg he beat
it up raw in his milk and drank it like that with a trembling hand.
He was too agitated to light his Primus and make tea.</p>

<p>He betook himself to Camborne Square.</p>

<p>He shouted Steenhold out of bed and stamped and bawled about the
room. He was determined to act, and now, at any cost. It was not
only Steenhold he bawled into action, but himself. "Now or never,"
he said. "The time has come to act. Now, when no one expects it, is
our moment. I have waited&mdash;I told you the other night I was
waiting. <i>Well</i>&mdash;the time is now."</p>

<p>Steenhold received his announcement in a state of stunned
admiration. He had always felt the latent explosives in Rud's
composition, and here at last, thank the gods, they were
exploding!</p>

<p>"You mean get the boys together?"</p>

<p>"I mean get them together now."</p>

<p>"Right, Chief."</p>

<p>Steenhold went to the telephone and began dialling. "Funny!" he
said. "Bodisham gave me this list of names three days ago. And I
didn't see what it was for. <i>Really!</i> Didn't see what it was
for...That you, Rogers?...Rogers!&mdash;The Hour has come."</p>

<p>The group and its associates assembled bit by bit. A miscellany
of odd cars parked outside in the Square. Rud was exalted, and they
listened with close attention. He walked up and down, he sat and
twisted himself about the back of his chair, reiterating his
conviction of a crisis.</p>

<p>"They've shot men in South Carolina. They landed marines to
co-operate with the state police. British marines shooting American
strikers. Think of it! The affair can't wait. Don't you see how
urgent it is and what it means to us?...</p>

<p>"I begged and prayed the Boss to take a line, and he put a flat
veto on the whole thing...I must speak. There are things that must
be said.</p>

<p>"How and where? I'll tell you exactly...There's that platform in
Hyde Park with one or two trained droolers, drooling his old
stuff...We go there. We take control."</p>

<p>Bodisham thought for a while, grasped Rud's idea and began to
fill in particulars.</p>

<p>"We go there by twos and threes and gather round the platform,"
said Bodisham. "Then when Rud thinks fit we put him on the
platform. There'll be some raw greenhorn in charge. If necessary
Rogers and you other stalwarts can hustle him...</p>

<p>"Can we get reporters? I don't mean news-hounds, I mean
reporters."</p>

<p>"I know a man or two," said Irwell.</p>

<p>"Shorthand?"</p>

<p>"We could have a man for a verbatim report," said Steenhold. "We
<i>ought</i> to have a man for a verbatim report."</p>

<p>"And after your speech?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Rud. "But get what I say reported. Get it
reported. And now I'm going upstairs to be still&mdash;perfectly
still&mdash;until it is time to go."</p>

<p>He vanished.</p>

<p>"He'll do it," said Steenhold, not at all clear in his own mind
what it was Rud would do.</p>

<p>The conspirators ate casually, wandering about the flat with
mugs and chunks of bread and cheese. There was a lot of staring out
of the window&mdash;as though the Future might be visible there
already. After one o'clock they began to depart by twos and threes
for Hyde Park.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; II</h3>

<p class="first">The park was vastly crowded that afternoon, but
over it hung a peculiar effect of inconsequence. It had less the
quality of a popular forum than of an aimless promenade of useless
people. It was a fermenting crowd, uneasy, and with no perceptible
direction. There was something of the quality of one of those
heavily clouded, brooding days on which there falls no single drop
of rain. The processions had been swallowed up in a shapeless swarm
of listeners and mockers and lookers-on. Over it all hummed a plane
from which an officer was directing the movements of an unobtrusive
but numerous police force by wireless. This plane and two little
fleets of police vans were a recent and provocative innovation by
the new Police Commissioner, but this afternoon it hummed above a
stormless, quaking marsh of people. No need to move them on. They
kept moving on.</p>

<p>The B.M.G.s converged. Rud made his way, silent but determined,
among the platforms, towards his particular objective.</p>

<p>The air was full of voices; the nearer ones patchily audible,
saying stereotyped things, the further ones a felt of raucous
sounds. All the speakers seemed bored. Everybody seemed bored and
dissatisfied. It was all politics and no reality. There was a big
Labour Party demonstration, to show once again and for all time
that no considerations of human welfare could shake for one moment
the stern resolve of the established British trade union leaders to
have no truck with Liberal politicians, men of science, men of
ideas, Communists, Americans or anyone who might attempt to share
the honours and emoluments that come at last to the implacably
obstructive in political life. There was a dissentient Labour
platform concerning itself with defining the fine differences in
organisation that justified its dissent. There was a Liberal
platform trying to steal Labour votes by its insistence upon the
trouble in the Ukraine and the Mysore prison scandal. There was a
Free Indian group and a platform of miscellaneous people pinning
their faith to the South Welsh prison scandals as a means of
raising a useful indignation. General objectives had long since
vanished in the intricacies of party strategy. At every Socialist
and Liberal platform the common man was being warned and incited
against every other Socialist or Liberal group&mdash;probably with
justice. One gathering charged the government with responsibility
for the recent outbreak of measles. The Ministry of Health had done
or not done this, that and the other thing, and at another point
the Ministry of Agriculture was being challenged very manfully
about some intricate manurial technicality. Isolationist platforms
clashed with demands for intervention in Spain, China, Siam, the
West Indies and Lithuania. Amidst the confusion religion reared its
head to reply to infidelity, and anti-vivisection called on all
mankind to end the greatest horror in the world. Communists in
alliance with Catholics, Communists of the Trotsky heresy,
Pro-Mexican Communists, New Communists and True Blue Communists,
beat upon the air and warned the common man against deleterious
imitations. It was less of a forum than a fair with every platform
trying to sell some monopoly of its own.</p>

<p>Overhead bumbled the plane, directing the unobtrusive movements
of the police, mindful of nothing said provided that nothing was
done. It was a very symbol of the invincible determination of the
government and institutions of Britain to yield to nothing less
than blasting operations in their obstruction to any conceivable
world reconstruction. And not to argue about it. They did not need
to divide and rule. They ruled a fissiparous Opposition. That
pervasive, soft droning gave the exactest expression to the
aimless, gentle firmness of the British constitution at home and to
its incalculable persistence in vaguely Imperialist assertion
abroad.</p>

<p>The recent happenings in South Carolina played a minor r&ocirc;le in
that crowd's confusion of thought and feeling. The press had
tempered the facts of the American social war to the mentality of
the British public, and the general ignorance of American geography
in England had prevented any realisation of the steady extension of
the conflict from state to state. The loss of confidence in the
remedial powers of Congress and the lapse of the whole South and
Middle West first towards sporadic lawlessness and then towards an
organised insurrectionary movement, had been masked by the
fragmentary nature of the news and overshadowed by the <i>de
facto</i> war in the Ukraine and the Balkans. No one had yet drawn
a working analogy between the Transatlantic and the European
situations.</p>

<p>The informal powers that worked through the forms of the British
constitution, however, were from their own point of view more alert
to the realities of the American situation; they had always had
close associations, financial and social as well as political, with
the reactionary Republicanism of Big Business, and they were in the
closest sympathy with the methods of obstruction, non-co-operation
and counter-attack that had defeated Franklin Roosevelt's
well-meant but not always well-balanced efforts to adapt the
traditions of private capitalism to the economic and social
stresses of a new age. They shared the same disregard of the
warnings of the times, the same uncompromising conservatism of
heart. They both wanted to pull the community back to the happy
eighties, and they were quite prepared for just as much repression
of the uneasy masses, repression direct or indirect, legal or
informal, and as unobtrusively violent, as possible.</p>

<p>Things were rather larger, more obvious and rougher on the
American side, but the issues were essentially the same. The
general public voted and demonstrated, but its voting seemed to
lead to nothing. It felt that things were done behind its back and
over its head but it could never understand clearly how. It never
seemed able to get sound news out of its newspapers nor good faith
out of its politicians. It resisted, it fumbled, it was becoming
more and more suspicious and sceptical, but it was profoundly
confused and ill-informed.</p>

<p>Rud's quick realisation that something profoundly significant
was happening across the Atlantic, or at least something that could
be presented as being profoundly significant, was well ahead of the
popular intelligence, but not so much ahead of it as to be out of
touch with its latent possibilities.</p>

<p>Spectators far outnumbered demonstrators in the park that
Sunday, and never had they found the flow of eloquence so trite.
They drifted from platform to platform. For anything fresh they
heard they might as well have been at Matins or Evensong. The
Popular Socialist platform had as usual contrived to get itself
within irritation length of the main Communist gathering. That was
now its established place. It was within irritation length, but it
had long since ceased to irritate. Its normal function in the past
had been to provoke violence and be rescued by the police in a
scrimmage which justified the arrest of what the authorities, for
the obscurest reasons, regarded as undesirable characters. But now
that worked no more.</p>

<p>The orthodox Communist bunch was not taking much notice of the
little band of purple shirts that afternoon. From 1937 onward an
almost genteel discretion had permeated the Communists. They had
found long since that indignation and violence were far less
effective against Lord Horatio's once-dreaded following than
ridicule. They would kill his trained speakers by listening to them
in a speudo-awestricken silence&mdash;in which they stumbled and
fell&mdash;or they would disconcert them by sudden baffling
interruptions. But this afternoon, because of the general vague
dissatisfaction, even the sport of ragging the Popular Socialists
was providing a poor draw.</p>

<p>Three or four dingy young Reds were attempting to get capital
out of the absence of Lord Horatio at Liverpool.</p>

<p>"Where's Horry to-day? Taking a day off with his girl? Hi Jeams!
Long Jeams there! Where's his Ludship?..."</p>

<p>Rud contemplated the scene.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Rogers.</p>

<p>"All our men are here?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And <i>now?</i>"</p>

<p>"We go on to the platform. Which way up?"</p>

<p>"Those trained speakers of Horry's are no good at all," said
Irwell, leading the way round the crowd. "Sheer waste of money.
Listen to that fool&mdash;a chick of three days old could heckle
him down."</p>

<p>"I'll speak," said Rud.</p>

<p>"This way," said Bodisham.</p>

<p>A tall young man wearing one of the prohibited purple shirts
(But one costume does not make an indictable uniform.) seemed to
recognise Rogers. He was acting as the day's usher of the
ineffective Popular Socialist eloquence. Rud found himself hoisted
to the platform by his henchmen. He elbowed his way towards the
front of the platform.</p>

<p>"You're not going to speak?" said the tall man.</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> going to speak."</p>

<p>"I've heard nothing about it from Hoggin."</p>

<p>"Change of plan at the last moment."</p>

<p>The tall young man turned to Rogers and asked in an audible
aside: "Who <i>is</i> this fellow?"</p>

<p>"<i>He's</i> all right," said Rogers. "You hear him."</p>

<p>"But what are you going to say, Mister?"</p>

<p>"You listen," said Rogers.</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Right now," said Rud. "Don't you bother me." And he pushed his
way to the forefront of the platform and stood glaring. The
audience had been having a routine time with the trained "Bowlers"
and they hailed a new face as a pleasant variation of the
afternoon's proceedings. "Ullo Beethoven!" said a red-faced,
frizzy-haired little man, giving a name that was not unhelpful to
Rud on later occasions. "Ullo Bottle-imp! The Things old Bohun
catches!"</p>

<p>Rud faced the interrupter with an outstretched hand. "Here
<i>Gollywog</i>," he said, "listen to me."</p>

<p>"Gollywog" fitted. Shouting and pushing subsided. This might be
worth listening to.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, brother Gollywog," said Rud intensely, "And thank
God for those <i>very</i> big ears he's given you...No! Don't start
talking till you've heard what I'm going to say to you. For if
there's a platform worth listening to, today here, it's this
platform I'm on. You don't know what this Popular Socialism means.
You never have known. You're going to know now."</p>

<p>"We know right enough," said the Gollywog. "Anti-Red and all
that balderdash! We've heard it a hundred times from your trained
purple parrots."</p>

<p>"You've heard nothing. You've just bawled as you're bawling now.
Listen, I tell you."</p>

<p>"Listen to him," said a bystander, and an expert in anti-Bohun
tactics said, "Freeze him out."</p>

<p>But there was no freezing out for Rud. "Good!" he said. "Now
don't make mistakes about me, and don't make mistakes about what's
on the platform this afternoon. You think I'm one of Lord Horry's
paid men. I'm not. You think I'm some sort of Anti&mdash;. I'd
rather be dead."</p>

<p>"Horry said&mdash;" began the Gollywog.</p>

<p>"I don't care a rap what Horry said. When Horry talks to you,
you answer Horry. But when I talk to you, you listen to me."</p>

<p>"But how about&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rud raised his voice. "Listen!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Look around and listen. Here's a score of platforms and scores
of speakers and what are they talking? <i>Anti!</i> They want to
stop somebody doing something, but what they want to <i>do</i>
themselves, Heaven only knows. They don't know. Turn out somebody
from government, from direction, from ownership, and put them in,
and they'll show you. Open your mouth and shut your eyes. That's
the dream of all these gentry who are shouting themselves hoarse on
these platforms. They want to set you <i>against</i> something.
They're all <i>against</i> something. Up against something. But
what they're Torah! Wait and see. They want you to clean up the men
in possession, and then <i>they</i> will be the men in possession.
And a hell of a lot of difference that will make to <i>you!</i>
Like your blessed old Labour Party which started out for Socialism
in Our Time and ended in the House of Lords. You've had that game
played on you often enough. Do you want it played again?"</p>

<p>"Well, wot's yer difference? You and your Lord 'Orry!"</p>

<p>"Who's talking of Bohun here?" said Rud.</p>

<p>"Well! What <i>are</i> you?"</p>

<p>"The common-sense of politics; that's what we are!"</p>

<p>"And what's that?"</p>

<p>"Unity! Not twenty platforms all shouting away through the
afternoon to advertise twenty different gangs of political pushers
and Welshers, but One Common Platform to ask for the things that
every man needs. In spite of that noisy buzzer overhead. Augh! Shut
<i>up</i>&mdash;up there! We want one great popular movement for
social justice wherever the English language is spoken. That's what
Popular Socialism means. Certain things are as plain as a
pikestaff."</p>

<p>"But Lordorry&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh <i>damn</i> Lord Horry!" said Rud.</p>

<p>"Here!" said the tall man. "You can't say that!"</p>

<p>"Shut up," said Rogers with his beefy shoulder against the chest
of the tall man. "Let our man speak!"</p>

<p>"But this is his Lordship's platform. Confound it, man!"</p>

<p>"Does it look like that to you? Go on, Rud, never mind
<i>this</i>."</p>

<p>"But, boys!" said the tall man, appealing to his stalwarts. He
made a move towards Rud, but he found Rogers, Steenhold, Bodisham,
Figgis and Redwood intervening. Swift and venomous undertones
passed. "Let the man speak!" said the crowd. "Leave him alone
Jeams. <i>Damn</i> Lord Horry! Right you are. Go <i>on</i>, Mister.
What next?"</p>

<p>"Well, I get sick of all this raking-up of what Mr. Gladstone
said fifty years ago, or what Lord Horatio said last spring. Damn
this allusive style, anyhow. Do let us talk, for once, about what
<i>all</i> of us want and all of us want said <i>now</i>. NOW!"</p>

<p>"You hear?" said Rogers, still leaning slightly against the tall
man.</p>

<p>"Don't you know us?" said Irwell. "You've seen <i>us</i> times
enough. Can't you trust your own men?"</p>

<p>"But this new chap!"</p>

<p>"Let him go on," said Steenhold at the tall man's ear.</p>

<p>It seemed the easiest thing to do. The crowd about the platform
was taking notice and growing. "Let him speak," they shouted. "The
little chap with the big face!"</p>

<p>"He's got to talk our stuff, mind you," said the tall man,
yielding. "<i>I'm</i> in charge here."</p>

<p>"Obviously," said Rogers, still fending him off. "Go ahead,
Rud."</p>

<p>And Rud went ahead.</p>

<p>"We've been christened Popular Socialists, and I suppose every
movement must wear a label, but if I'd been in at the christening,
boys, I should have said the Party of the Common Man, the Party of
the Common Man, here in England, away in America, in Africa,
Australia, China and all over the earth."</p>

<p>"But Horry is a nationalist out and out!"</p>

<p>Rud did not even answer that comment. He waved it away as if it
was a fly.</p>

<p>"The Party of the Common Man&mdash;everywhere. The Plain Needs
of Common-sense! First he wants peace and security, and what stands
in the way of that? All these damned localised governments that
divide us up and set us fighting&mdash;set us fighting against our
own brothers. Think of it&mdash;English guns being lent to the Old
Gang in America to shoot English-speaking strikers! We want one
government everywhere, not all these governments, one common-sense
government for our common needs."</p>

<p>"But that's Internationalism! That's Communism!"</p>

<p>"Augh! Never mind those words!" said Rud. "Do we want one law in
the world or many, you crowd of cannon-fodder, you bombees of
to-morrow? Isn't it plain as a pikestaff that one government means
peace, and many war? Well, let's get that one government. It's
these old national governments out of the past that stand in the
way and won't let go. Do we want them? Not a bit. But they want
themselves! That's one thing we want. <i>One</i> government keeping
the peace everywhere.</p>

<p>"And next we want Plenty. Everyone who knows says we can have
Plenty to-day for everyone. All the men of science say that. Why
don't we <i>have</i> it? Because a few people won't let us get at
the earth and get at the work. They've appropriated it, they squat
in on it just as they squat in on Power, and they have to be
expropriated&mdash;expropriated by the sheer common-sense of
everyone. They string a net of private property about our futile
paralysed world, and they trick us with this false money that they
keep on changing and increasing and diminishing so that you don't
know from day to day what a shilling is worth to you. They pretend
they can't help it. Do you believe that? Do you believe they can't
help the boat rocking? Do you believe they can't help supplies
being locked up? Do you think they don't know what they're doing?
They want Power over us. And do you think <i>you</i> don't know
that? In your bones you do. They'd rather see the world wrecked
than give up their Power game. And we are the pawns!</p>

<p>"It doesn't take ten years of study, you don't need to go to the
University, to find out that this is a damned good world gone
wrong. Gone wrong, because it is being monkeyed with by people too
greedy and mean and wrong-hearted altogether to do the right thing
by our common world. They've grabbed it and they won't let go. They
might lose their importance; they might lose their pull. Everywhere
it's the same. Beware of the men you make your masters. Beware of
the men you trust.</p>

<p>"We've only got to be clear-headed to sing the same song and
play the same game all over the world, we common men. We don't want
Power monkeyed with, we don't want Work and Goods monkeyed with,
and, above all, we don't want Money monkeyed with. That's the
elements of politics everywhere. When these things go wrong, we go
wrong. That's how people begin to feel it and see it in America.
That's how we feel it here&mdash;when we look into our minds.
That's what common people feel everywhere. That's what our brother
whites&mdash;'poor whites' they call them&mdash;in those towns in
South Carolina are fighting for now. Fighting our battle. Why
aren't we with them? We speak the same language; we share the same
blood. Who has been keeping us apart from them for a hundred and
fifty-odd years? Ruling classes. Politicians. Dear old flag and all
that stuff!</p>

<p>"Our school-books never tell us a word about the American common
man; and his school-books never tell him a word about us. They
flutter flags between us to keep us apart. Split us up for a
century and a half because of some fuss about taxing tea. And what
are our wonderful Labour and Socialist and Communist leaders doing
to change that? What are they doing to unite us English-speaking
common men together and give us our plain desire? Are they doing
anything more for us than the land barons and the factory barons
and the money barons? Not a bit of it! These labour leaders of
to-day mean to be lords to-morrow. They are just a fresh set of
dishonest trustees. Look at these twenty-odd platforms here! Mark
their needless contradictions! Their marvellous differences on
minor issues. 'Manoeuvres!' 'Intrigue.' 'Personalities.'
'Monkeying.' 'Don't trust him, trust <i>me!</i>' All of them at it.
Mark how we common men are distracted, how we are set hunting first
after one red herring and then after another, for the want of
simple, honest interpretation..."</p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>The tall young man listened in a state of great perplexity. He
was determined to intervene and shut Rud up when it was necessary,
but how was he to determine when it was necessary? This was queer
stuff, but it was holding a gathering crowd. It was stealing more
and more people from the communist accumulation. Perhaps "Simple,
honest interpretation" meant Lord Horatio. Perhaps this stranger
would come round to that presently. And always if the man went too
far, afterwards it would be possible to say a few words, chairman
fashion, and put things right again. If these unaccountably
menacing fellows on each side of him had the sense to let him, that
is.</p>

<p>Rud unfolded the Chiffan-Whitlow scheme of world salvation in
broad outline as the two of them had hammered it out in their early
discussions; its insistence on a common Anglo-American basis at any
cost&mdash;at the cost of "every institution, crown, constitution
or what-not, however old, however venerable," that might stand in
the way; its bold proposal to reorganise and control the whole
financial apparatus of the world; its assurances of the hope in
science of a universal plenty; its wide development of Huey Long's
almost fanatic educationalism. "This is what we are for!" he
bawled. "<i>Anti</i>&mdash;be damned! We are Pro-Pax-Mundi. We
stand <i>for</i> Mankind to-day and I tell you Mankind will stand
for us to-morrow."</p>

<p>He became aware of a change in the situation, a lull to the left
of him. The communist platform had gone out of business, and a
little knot of their supporters were pushing their way towards him.
He welcomed this intervention. He threw them phrases and sentences
to provoke an argument.</p>

<p>"This is what Communism stands for?" he answered them. "Stealing
<i>your</i> thunder? Nonsense! Your old Marx prophesied the
Revolution, but he never saw an inch beyond it. He knew nothing of
modern scientific production. He never distinguished between
financial and material property. He knew nothing about money, not a
thing. Why don't you put him back in Highgate Cemetery and forget
about him?...Well, put a great, lying, flattering monument over him
if you must, and <i>then</i> forget about him."</p>

<p>The ascendancy of the platform was an immense advantage to Rud.
They had made a mistake in coming down from their own platform to
get near him. They had to shout from below at him. He caught up
what they had to say at the point when it gave him the most
effective reply. He delivered every sentence as though he scored a
point against them.</p>

<p>The two officials and the little American-born countess they had
with them in the observation plane, noted the increasing
accumulation of hearers about the Popular Socialist nucleus, but
they heard nothing of the immense subversiveness of Rud's
restatement of Popular Socialist aims. A gentle infiltration of the
growing assemblage by the forces of law and order was set going.
The observers overhead heard nothing of the steady attack upon the
American policy of the government, linked with a systematic
depreciation of Lord Horatio, upon which Rud was launched.</p>

<p>"Leaders are nothing," said Rud. "Parties are nothing.
Governments are nothing. Look at the thing with plain common-sense.
Nothing matters but the common man."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;!" spluttered the tall young man. "Steady on!" and
"<i>Wait</i> a moment."</p>

<p>"Shut it," said Rogers.</p>

<p>"We Popular Socialists stand for plain common-sense, put in
order and kept clear," said Rud. "Just as Science does. We stand
for that and nothing else. We want no dogmas and we want no
dictators and leaders...No. We here are the party of the common
man&mdash;common one and all. Our only theory is to keep our eyes
open&mdash;<i>your</i> eyes open. And to hell with all this
strategy and party discipline and leadership and the climbers and
the stand-patters who obstruct and divide us." (Futile cry of "But
how about Horry?") "What I am telling you is simply and plainly
what <b>you</b> think. It's <i>your</i> natural stuff. I'm no
leader setting myself up here to know better than anyone, what
ought to be done and what has to be done to bring it about. I don't
ask you to open your mouths and shut your eyes and see what
<i>I</i> will give you. I'm not leader number six hundred and
fifty-nine, to start a new divergence. I'm just a common man who
knows how to put it, and nothing more. I'm your megaphone. That's
the Popular Socialist way...</p>

<p>"Yes, that's democracy. That's what you Communists have
forgotten. You tied yourselves up in a rigid organisation. You put
on Stalin and Stalinism like a gag and a straightjacket."
(Uproar.)</p>

<p>"Lord Horry? Popular Socialism made him, I tell you, and Popular
Socialism can break him. He's our figure-head to-day&mdash;but only
in the service of common sense. As long as he cares to serve common
sense. And work hard for <i>us</i>. Our reality is in you
<i>all</i>, all of you. All of <i>us</i>. He'll be the first to
admit it. Fall in with us. Simplify! Unite! Commonsense! Now do you
get me? Now do you understand where we are?"</p>

<p>He paused for his applause and he got it. The tall young man
appeared to be saying something, but nobody heard what he had to
say.</p>

<p>Rud had fired his shot. He stood without an idea in the world
about the next step to take. Left to himself he would probably have
got down from the platform and gone home.</p>

<p>"We can march back on this," said Bodisham suddenly at his
elbow.</p>

<p>"March back?"</p>

<p>"To headquarters. While we're on the crest."</p>

<p>"But where?"</p>

<p>"To headquarters!" cried Steenhold, gleefully grasping the idea.
"Oh, great!"</p>

<p>"Headquarters!" said Dreed. "Of <i>course!</i>"</p>

<p>"Your meeting's a thundering success," said Irwell to the tall
young man. "Now's the time for the triumphant exit...No. They don't
want to hear you."</p>

<p>Rud had got it in an instant. He was already gesticulating to
the crowd. He had made Bodisham's inspiration his own. Mastery
returned to him. Of course! Now was the moment to strike. He
shouted:</p>

<p>"Now that I've explained things to you, perhaps you'll fall in
with us. March with us to the Purple House! We don't mind a red
banner or two. Facts, not flags, is our motto. Put down your names
with us. Never mind your party or your party wire-pullers. Never
mind your leaders! Or ours for that matter. Come and give a cheer
for the common-sense man, the good old common man, who's the real
backbone of all of us. (Let's get a move on, Bodisham.)"</p>

<p>The re-formation of the homeward march was a thing of routine.
Rud saw two manifest newspaper men making notes. "The shorthand
reporter?" he said to Chiffan.</p>

<p>"O.K." said Chiffan. "I looked after that."</p>

<p>"Where's the band? Where's the other banners?" said Bodisham,
taking complete control of the tall young man.</p>

<p>"There's one banner about the Jews," said Rud in a quick
undertone over his shoulder. "Furl that. We don't want that stuff
to-day&mdash;anyhow. Furl <i>all</i> the banners. We'll alter those
rotten inscriptions later."</p>

<p>"Hustle round, boys," said the tall young man to his posse of
stalwarts. "Keep together," said Rogers, close behind him...</p>

<p>And how was the official observer in the air above to know that
the Popular Socialist procession that was reforming itself and
making a departure so much more spirited and substantial than its
arrival, was really a captured procession? All that he remarked was
that it seemed to be exercising a suctorial influence on the
accumulating crowd round about it. It seemed to be taking
three-quarters of the communist crowd with it. That was odd. There
might be some sort of trouble presently. So the radio got to work
and the police drifted towards the purple banners, to see that law
and order kept pace with the swelling crowd.</p>

<p>Rud was borne along with his particular adherents in the midst
of the column. He carried himself now in a grave and preoccupied
manner. At moments he felt like a mighty commander with everything
obedient to his hand; at moments he felt like a cork in a stream.
But his prevailing feeling was confidence and exaltation.
Everything was going easily. There had been no fighting. The crowd
was driving along in a state of indeterminate appreciation. Someone
had started shouts of "Common-sense Party. Not too soon." And
"Commonsense at last." One voice even cried "Good old Horry," and
another tried the old slogan: "<i>We</i> want Bohun." But no one
took that up. The Popular Socialist band, of two kettledrums and
half a dozen fifes, sustained the Popular Socialist marching
tune:</p>

<p class="poem">"One, two; one, two, three,<br>
Horry Bohun is the man for me."</p>

<p>But a number of men and lads and one or two young women were
pressing in on the central group to get a nearer view of Rud.
"What's <i>your</i> name, mate? What's his name, Mister?"</p>

<p>"Rud," said Rogers.</p>

<p>"Rud <i>what?</i>"</p>

<p>"Just Rud."</p>

<p>"Rud. Rud&mdash;His name's Just Rud."</p>

<p>Presently they were repeating:</p>

<p class="poem">"One, two; one, two, three,<br>
Just Rud is the man for me."</p>

<p>Rud exchanged rapid opinions with Steenhold and Chiffan.
"Nothing more doing to-day," he said. "A few words from the
window?"</p>

<p>"And then take possession," said Bodisham.</p>

<p>"If the crowds hang about?"</p>

<p>"It's going to rain," said Chiffan. "And the police will keep
them moving. All that about enrolling them will evaporate quietly.
You'll see. The pubs open at seven and the cinemas will be opening
now."</p>

<p class="poem">"One, two; one, two, three,<br>
Just Rud is the man for me."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; III</h3>

<p class="first">Rud went to one of the three drawing-room windows,
opened it wide, and stood out on the little pseudo-balcony. His
sense of fitness required a few words from a balcony; it was his
conception of the part. The band had gone round to the garage
behind headquarters, and the few policemen were having no trouble
in keeping the crowd moving. The idea of enrolling a great crowd of
adherents had evaporated insensibly, even as Chiffan had said.
There was a cessation of movement at Rud's appearance, the police
stood still for a moment and someone cried "Speech!" Rud held up a
reassuring hand to the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Nothing more doing to-night. Thank you for joining us, and
thank you for giving us a hearing. If I may suggest something;
Three cheers for Unity. And three cheers for the Common Man
everywhere, and may God help him to his own...Thank you. That's
all."</p>

<p>He moved back from the window.</p>

<p>"Not a cheer for yourself?" said Irwell. "You can't be modest as
a leader. You had your chance then. Shall <i>I</i> tell 'em?"</p>

<p>Rud half-turned towards him and said something Chiffan was never
to forget.</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> the common man," said Rud.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; IV</h3>

<p class="first">Rud turned about and surveyed the room before
him...</p>

<p>The Purple House, it should be explained, consisted at that time
of a couple of big stucco houses with porticos, in that region of
large, white, later-Georgian mansions between Kensington and
Paddington. Bohun had wanted to paint it an imperial purple, but
the police and the ground landlord had opposed this idea, and so it
had the normal dingy pallor of its neighbours, relieved only by
purple front doors, now greatly faded, and with tarnished gilt
knockers, purple painted ironwork and black blinds. Behind these
two houses were garages, one mysteriously locked up, and the other
devoted to a store of banners and the band's stuff, with a
bagatelle table, table-tennis, a cask of beer and other reliefs to
the tedium of the adherents "on duty".</p>

<p>One house, number seventeen, was reserved for his lordship, and
its door yielded only to his latch-key, but an internal
communication had been made with number sixteen, by an opening
between the halls. Number sixteen was the common entrance and there
was a "guard room" on the ground floor in which three or four bored
young louts were usually "on duty"&mdash;rather vaguely conceived.
The most definite obligation was a smart salute for the Boss or
Commander Hoggin or Major Smike.</p>

<p>The first floor was a common assembly-room reaching from front
to back of the house, capacious and furnished only with plain
chairs and a few occasional tables. Along one side of the back
portion was a trestle-board bearing a tea-urn, jugs of lemonade and
cakes.</p>

<p>Most of the stalwarts had produced virile pipes and lusty great
pouches. They were standing about in knots and talking uneasily.
Much of the afternoon's happenings had been incomprehensible to
them. In a way it had seemed "all right" and in some ways it had
seemed "odd". They were puzzled about the apparition of Rud. They
wanted to know more about him. Was he going to be the new
favourite?</p>

<p>The tall young man "in control" was one of Lord Horatio's later
discoveries. It was among his Lordship's little weaknesses to turn
against his men who began to "know too much" and to introduce
inexperience and incapacity as "new blood". So that all his
officials were insecure of their positions and there was a long and
growing list of men he had turned down, ready to turn up again.
Bodisham had been establishing touch with these scattered rejects
for some time. He was forming them into what he called his
"reserve". And the Purple House itself was smouldering with
uncertainties, resentments and suppressions from roof to
cellar.</p>

<p>The tall young man was slowly developing a sense of grievance,
as the exhilaration of an unusually effective meeting passed
off.</p>

<p>"But what's your trouble?" asked Rogers.</p>

<p>"What I complain of is the want of system&mdash;of orders. I
ought to have O.K.'d him before he said a single word. And Hoggin
ought to have O.K.'d him."</p>

<p>"Well, didn't he speak well? Didn't he <i>get</i> them?"</p>

<p>"But did Lord Horatio send him?"</p>

<p>Bodisham hesitated and then had an inspiration. He glanced at
Rud as if to make sure he was not being overheard, and then he
leant forward to the tall young man and spoke in a confidential
undertone. "<i>I'm not sure</i>," he said. "I don't
know&mdash;exactly&mdash;myself&mdash;what relationship there is
between them."</p>

<p>The tall young man contemplated Rud. "You mean?"</p>

<p>"I don't know enough to mean anything precisely."</p>

<p>"But you feel?"</p>

<p>Bodisham reflected. He said nothing but he nodded repeatedly in
a confidential and deeply significant manner. "But didn't you come
with him?"</p>

<p>"Steenhold brought him. And Steenhold's been in the
organisation, off and on, for years."</p>

<p>"I see. All the same I think I was let down about that fellow.
On that platform I was made to look&mdash;well&mdash;a bit of a
fool. I didn't know&mdash;<i>what</i>. I was taken by surprise. I
might have given him a clip on the jaw and spun him off the
platform."</p>

<p>"You <i>might</i>," agreed Rogers. "But you have too much sense.
The Boss knew that."</p>

<p>"Yes. What I can report to Lord Horatio I don't know. It's hard
to phrase it. I don't want to be hard on one of his friends."</p>

<p>"Better to understate than overstate," counselled Bodisham. "You
might claim you discovered him."</p>

<p>The tall young man seemed to be recovering his self-confidence.
"In some ways anyhow, that chap <i>is</i> an acquisition, you know.
He can spout..."</p>

<p>Rud surveyed the groups in the room for a while, as if he
consented to their existence, but meant to keep his eye on them.
Then, with his hands behind his back in the manner of a pensive
Napoleon and saying nothing to anyone, he left Irwell and Chiffan
at the window, walked past them all and upstairs to the room of his
two interviews with Lord Horatio.</p>

<p>It was, as he expected, empty. He walked round the great
ornamental unbusinesslike desk, seated himself in the much too
ample chair of his lordship, took up the large paper-knife and
tapped thoughtfully with it as he meditated. This time he
remembered most of his speech. He thought it was an extremely good
speech for the occasion.</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> the common man," he repeated. It had leapt to his
mind out of nothingness. It could be made a cardinal slogan.</p>

<p>Another part of his mind was busy upon quite a different line.
He was wondering whether he would keep on Mrs. Crumb.</p>

<p>If she could see him now! She'd topple over backwards. He was
still smiling quietly at that thought when the door opened and
Chiffan and Bodisham came in.</p>

<p>"Well," said Bodisham. "Here you are in the lion's den."</p>

<p>"For a time," said Rud. "Won't you sit down? There's a chair
behind that table where his stenographer sits, and if you shove
that pile of pamphlets off the table&mdash;they're no beastly good
anyhow&mdash;<i>The Heart and Soul of a Great
Leader</i>&mdash;Lord! Shove 'em off and there'll be the table to
sit on too. So's he can find them. Don't <i>lift</i> them off. Let
'em drop in a heap there. The next move's with him."</p>

<p>"I suppose he's booming and gargling that old speech of his
about now," said Bodisham. "Or maybe a little later. He'll get his
first idea of what has happened here to-morrow when he opens the
morning paper."</p>

<p>"And then the great purple car will turn its mighty lanterns
Londonward," said Chiffan. "We're well started. There's no going
back. I suppose that tall fellow, what's his name?"</p>

<p>"Frobisher."</p>

<p>"Won't have telephoned?"</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Bodisham. "He wouldn't know what to
telephone, but anyhow Rogers and Steenhold are in charge of him.
He's amenable. He has a grievance. He's half with us in a perplexed
way already. They're all stale here. Things have got into a kind of
routine through sheer lack of inventiveness. Here we are and here
in effect we have to stick. There's no way on, but onward&mdash;as
you said last week. We can do practically what we like
here&mdash;until Horry comes back. Then the fat will be in the
fire. Then the real flare-up will begin. Presently when most of the
boys have gone home and there's nobody downstairs but Longshanks
and the guards on duty, you and I will look the number seventeen
over. It has its points of interest. It's queer&mdash;</p>

<p>"In fact," said Bodisham, after a short interval, "it's
<i>very</i> queer..."</p>

<p>And then: "<i>Very</i>."</p>

<p>He seemed to be thinking very hard about Rud. He seemed to have
some sort of uncertainty about Rud.</p>

<p>"There are some locked doors," said Bodisham. "I happen&mdash;.
As a matter of fact I was put in control here for a time last
September and I have duplicate keys. I had them made. I always had
my doubts of Horry. About that under-hung jaw of his and those eyes
too close together. I made some discoveries, and then I waxed the
key. I don't think you quite realise yet what he is. You will see.
You think he's an Ass. He's an Ass all right, but he's something
more than that...In some ways he's a dangerous Ass...We've got to
be prepared. We've got to know the animal we hunt or we may have
some nasty surprises. I want you to see."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; V</h3>

<p class="first">Rud saw.</p>

<p>The arcana of the basement and cellars of number seventeen and
the flavour of the locked-up garage behind altered the whole
complexion of the day for Rud. He had been living triumphantly in a
storm of rhetoric all day, living gloriously by the spoken word. "I
<i>am</i> the Common Man." He had been carried by the torrent of
his own speech into the very seat of the boss. In the absence of
the boss. Now here was something more fundamental than
rhetoric.</p>

<p>Bodisham had closed and relocked the double doors behind them.
The second one was covered with green baize for the evident purpose
of making it sound-proof. The main cellar was a sort of arsenal,
with a newly-made bolthole and dug-out below it. There were only
about a dozen rifles in the arms collection, but there were three
or four guns with short barrels, a considerable miscellany of
pistols, life-preservers, assorted ammunition, a trunk of
knuckle-dusters, truncheons, and a number of other
murderous-looking implements whose use was not immediately
apparent.</p>

<p>"<i>Golly!</i>" said Chiffan. "It's a bit out of a gangster
film. It's a schoolboy's dream. At least&mdash;It would have been a
dream twenty-five years ago. But <i>now</i>&mdash;Of course,
<i>weapons!</i></p>

<p>"Weapons. Human beings have always loved weapons. Hardly a man
alive who does not love to caress a good rifle..."</p>

<p>He became exceedingly thoughtful for a space.</p>

<p>"This isn't all," said Bodisham. "There's more yet."</p>

<p>He unlocked a door at the back of the cellar and led the way
along a paved passage to a group of and cramped apartments, three
on either side. They had heavy doors with bolts and locks on the
outer face, and each had a small, square peep-hole in the upper
panel.</p>

<p>"They look like prison cells," said Rud.</p>

<p>"They <i>are</i> prison cells," said Bodisham.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;Illegal?"</p>

<p>"Party discipline. Kidnapping. How should I know?"</p>

<p>"He's never used them?"</p>

<p>"We don't know. One's rather dirty and has&mdash;you
know&mdash;the prison smell.</p>

<p>"It reminds one a little of the sort of thing they had under the
chateaux of the Loire," said Bodisham. "Or in High Germany.
Picturesque, romantic old High Germanee."</p>

<p>"The Boss must be crazy."</p>

<p>"Crazy!" said Chiffan. "But <i>is</i> he? No! It's the new style
in politics. He's merely been studying continental models. This
sort of thing is current political reality in a dozen countries
to-day. Dilettantism&mdash;no! Grim reality. It's spreading. Why
shouldn't it spread here? <i>He's</i> just been doing his best to
keep up with the times. Why, in Belgium, for example, there must be
dozens and dozens of little caches like this now. And in
Czechoslovakia. Not to speak of France and Germany."</p>

<p>"I don't believe," said Rud.</p>

<p>"I'm not telling you things," said Bodisham. "I'm <i>showing</i>
you things."</p>

<p>"Kidnapping. Secret arrests," said Chiffan. "There's enough here
to show you what the Boss has been dreaming about. Dreaming, do I
say? Contemplating. Continental methods. He's just a sample. It's
all coming back. It never really left off. The little ways of man
with man. I suppose they kept stuff like this in the Tower. The
Bourbons did it. <i>Lettres de cachet</i>. Napoleon kidnapped and
murdered people. The Brown House. The Lipari Islands. Quiet corners
of the Ogpu life. Under the British raj, in some of the prince's
palaces. Under any dispensation. Here it is&mdash;right under our
noses."</p>

<p>"But to find this in England!" said Rud.</p>

<p>"Why not in England?" asked Chiffan.</p>

<p>"Or America," said Bodisham. "Much more probable in
America."</p>

<p>"In a great free country like America!" protested Rud.</p>

<p>"Running the world by votes and resolutions and processions and
demonstrations is all very well when things are easy and the other
side won't fight," said Chiffan. "But there's always been jails and
there's always been cellars and drains under the social fabric, and
when houses are pulled down or tumble down, the cellars come up to
the surface and the drains stink...Esoteric politics, Rud. You've
got to face it, my boy."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VI</h3>

<p class="first">The B.M.G.s decided to hold a council of war in
Steenhold's upper flat. The Purple House was arranged for autocracy
and not for conferences. There was no accommodation for camping or
sleeping in the place, but Rogers, Dreed and Redwood remained to
sit up all night and keep an eye on Frobisher. The rest were to go
home or sleep at Steenhold's flat. Roll-call was to be at number
sixteen in the morning before nine.</p>

<p>At Camborne Square they sat late and discussed the situation
from every point of view. Could they consider they had captured or
were going to capture the Purple House? What was the constitution
of the Popular Socialist Party?</p>

<p>"What is our status there?" said Irwell. "Are we technically
burglars? Or trespassers?"</p>

<p>"We are the Popular Socialist Party, I take it&mdash;at home,"
said Rud. "The Purple House isn't a private house. It's
Headquarters."</p>

<p>"But it's Bohun's house."</p>

<p>"He's a trustee&mdash;at most he's a trustee. He must have
divested himself in a sort of way."</p>

<p>"I doubt if it will be matter for litigation," said
Bodisham.</p>

<p>"We shall have to fight for that house, whatever the legal
position may be," said Chiffan. "And we'd better get ready for
that. Knives and kicking and that sort of thing. You may bet on
that. Pity we haven't Rogers here. He's our Big Fist, our Organiser
of Violence."</p>

<p>"I agree with you," said Bodisham. "I haven't the slightest
doubt there will have to be some rough work before we get hold of
the Purple House. If we do get hold of it. Horry may not make much
show in the way of brains, but you can bet he will show
fight&mdash;and a pretty nasty sort of fight..."</p>

<p>Presently Rud found his mind wandering from the finer points of
strategy.</p>

<p>"None of the Party have ever disappeared?" he asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Not that I ever heard of," said Rogers.</p>

<p>"You've never heard anything, Colin?"</p>

<p>"Never heard a thing," said Dreed. "All this secret prison
business is as new to me as it is to you."</p>

<p>"Nor you, Irwell?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>(Intimidation. Rough handling?...Torture? In London. In 1941!
What sort of game were we playing?)</p>

<p>They were looking at him.</p>

<p>"It's just a crazy schoolboy's imagination," said Rud.
"I'm&mdash;curious. Go on with what you were saying. We are going
to demand a general meeting of the Party&mdash;and force a sort of
want of confidence motion. Good."</p>

<p>"I have some ideas about that meeting," said Steenhold. "There
was an Enquiry in Washington&mdash;but never mind that now. But I
have an idea. A <i>lovely</i> idea."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VII</h3>

<p class="first">Rud slept but little that night. He got out of
bed. He got back into bed. He got out again. He went to the window
and stared at a blank wall opposite. He tried to assemble the
situation in his mind. He murmured and then recited fragments of
his speech so far as he could recall it. He was trying not to think
of something&mdash;a silly impossible idea, but at the same time
very ugly and disagreeable. Kidnapping was in it and thumbscrews,
and a vast large freckled face with the eyes too close together,
that continually approached, full of menace, full of cruel
deliberation. He would not think of it. He would not. If he had to
keep repeating his speech all night...</p>

<p>His insomnia exasperated him more and more. Never had the
contrast between his immense ambitions and his flimsy body, his
lurid imagination and his unbalanced nerves, distressed him so
acutely. He wanted to sleep and there was no sleep; no sleep, no
repose, no position in which he could keep still. And always these
foolish imaginations kept creeping nearer to him and nearer. They
wouldn't keep away. He was awake and yet he was dreaming.</p>

<p>He cursed. For a moment he got quite out of hand. He made a
feeble slog at nothing with his fist. "No, you <i>don't</i>," he
shouted. "No, you <i>don't</i>. Don't come another step nearer me!"
His sudden movement upset a row of books on his chest of drawers
and the end one fell with a resounding smack on the floor. He was
moved to fling all the other books after it. He realised the need
for self-control in time.</p>

<p>He addressed himself as though he was a public meeting.</p>

<p>"Get to sleep," he said. "You've things to do to-morrow.
Tremendous things! To-morrow is <i>the</i> day. You've got to
sleep. <i>Got</i> to sleep. Hold yourself together, man. You've got
to go through with it now. Hold yourself together. Have you
<i>got</i> it, Rud my boy? Hold yourself together."</p>

<p>Rap. Rap. Rap on the wall.</p>

<p>A drowsy, angry voice was calling to him through the thin
partition. "Hold yourself together, man. Yes, and shut up. Go to
sleep, yes, or by God! I'll come another step nearer you and no
mistake. I'll come and I'll bloody-well kill you."</p>

<p>It was astonishing, but there was a sort of relief in hearing
this thick, wholesomely angry, human voice.</p>

<p>"Talking in my sleep," called Rud, after a moment's reflection.
"Nightmare." (No good ending a political career prematurely in a
fight with an unknown fellow-lodger.)</p>

<p>"Rot! Shut <i>up!</i>"</p>

<p>"Good night," said Rud, sitting on his bed.</p>

<p>"Goo' ni', you howling monkey, and don't let me hear you again.
See?"</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>The unknown fellow-lodger was presently audible as a formidable
snore. Rud sat quite still, thinking and gnawing his knuckles.</p>

<p>He forgot the snore for a moment. His hand gripped upon
imaginary weapons of defence.</p>

<p>"Don't think of it," he whispered very low. It was nothing. But
he had better sit up. If he went to sleep he'd certainly have a
real nightmare and shout again. There ought to be some sort of drug
to tranquillise a brain too fatigued to quiet down of its own
accord. Perhaps if he jotted down a few notes...</p>

<p>"There ought to be a doctor in the Party," thought Rud. "Someone
to stand by me. I wish we had some chap...Carstall for
example."</p>

<h2><a id="chap2_03" name="chap2_03"></a>III. &mdash; RUD BECOMES A
PUBLIC CHARACTER</h2>

<h3>&sect; I</h3>

<p class="first">Lord Horatio too had not slept well that night,
although he had occupied Lady Garbees' pet visitors' bedroom. He
was in a state of unusual discontent with himself. He was asking
himself whether he had not missed his way in life altogether.</p>

<p>Bonina (Lady Garbees) had almost said as much. "I hated this
evening. Never have I felt before how uncongenial this English
atmosphere can be to all we are and all <i>we</i> care for. On that
platform, standing up before that dismal crowd of C3 clerks and
errand boys, I pitied you. I pitied myself. You may be English
through and through, but all the same, you are alien here. You
would be alien in any of these dismal democratic countries. You
are&mdash;<i>arbitrary</i>, my dear. You are like one of those
great Florentine princes. You are a born grandee. I don't say that
to flatter you. I don't flatter you. You know it's the truth as
well as I do."</p>

<p>"Ye-e-s," he said, wanting more of it. "For some time I have
been feeling&mdash;out of touch."</p>

<p>"We American aristocrats feel the same thing." (She was American
born.) It is the mean, puritanical, <i>English</i> tradition.
Always&mdash;politics without a shred of dignity. Over there in
spite of everything&mdash;it clings to us still. New England has
always been just England and a little more so, but we down in the
south went back to the sun and to power over our fellow-creatures.
In England political life always <i>has</i> been <i>squalid</i>.
How Shakespeare felt that! <i>How</i> his contempt breaks out
against the many-headed monster and its 'stinking greasy caps!
'Musty superfluity.' That was his name for democracy. I was reading
<i>Coriolanus</i> yesterday. Shakespeare would have been with you
up to the hilt, the dagger's hilt...</p>

<p>"English people are naturally <i>common</i> in grain...Lucy and
I when we went to Biskra&mdash;A sort of splendour about the Arabs.
Nature's noblemen. You could meet the hall porter on equal terms.
This English temperament! It is like the mild, mild, old and mild
climate. Never really hot, never really cold. Sunshine like genteel
compliments and rain like sentimental tears. It's all one with the
soft, mawkish scenery. Trimmed trees; polite fields; snug little
cottages, hawthorns and primroses. Snug's the word. No mountains,
no snows, no stupendous gorges, no <i>guts</i> in it, Horry, no
<i>guts!</i>"</p>

<p>Bonina's purpose may have been to console him for the particular
flatness of the great Birthday Meeting in the smaller Saltbag Hall,
but her words carried further than that. It was breaking in upon
his proud, reluctant intelligence that for&mdash;how long was it
now?&mdash;fifteen years he had been wasting his great gifts and
all the potentialities of his vitality upon a community incapable
of appreciation, a facetious population, a population capable of
nothing but an oafish stare or a derisive grin, too stupid even to
bow before wrath and scorn. All that could be done had been done to
make these dull mechanic souls walk with a prouder step behind a
natural leader. He had sold them purple shirts at 40 per cent below
cost. He had drilled them, had them lectured to, sought speakers
who could be trained to inspire them. He had been to Germany, he
had been to Italy, again and again, to study leadership, to mark
the methods of evoking the generous youth and strength and
imagination of those nobler peoples. You can make ordinary Germans
and Italians out of the streets crow like cocks, strut like
peacocks and salute like gladiators about to die. "Serried ranks"
are where they are most at home. But these English! They love to be
out of step. At some expense he had hired clever literary fellows
to write him a song book, and clever musical fellows to adapt
notoriously successful tunes to the purposes of the movement. Think
of the gusto with which a German crowd would have let out that
Birthday Hymn:</p>

<p class="poem">"England awake, salute the Happy Morn<br>
On which our Movement and our Boss were born."</p>

<p>You would have expected that to stir these urban clowns and open
their eyes to what they might be. And then again:</p>

<p class="poem">"Onward Bohun's soldiers, marching as to War,<br>
With the Jews and Bolsheviks scampering before."</p>

<p>It was a trumpet-call! But for all the result it got it might
have been a bray.</p>

<p>He had given those boys a gymnasium, he had given them a
recreation-room, he had sold them balls, badges, rackets, tents,
camping outfits, knuckle-dusters and sheath-knives at half cost or
less...</p>

<p>And they could not even keep in tune! You might think they were
ashamed of the song.</p>

<p>He had made his speech, his usual speech, to a scanty audience,
too thick-headed to realise that now he was no longer making that
speech with his former pleading, winning conviction, but in a
spirit of contemptuous irony.</p>

<p>The subtle change in his intonation had been completely lost
upon them...</p>

<p>After he had left Bonina in the small hours he had slept for a
time and then grown wakeful again. His mind passed through a series
of alternations between uneasy dreaming and dreamy wakefulness, in
which the one continuing idea was his complete failure to grip the
popular imagination or realise himself in these political
activities upon which he had launched himself so hopefully and so
rashly.</p>

<p>It had been going on for fifteen years. Fifteen years of
leadership&mdash;with practically nobody falling in behind. His
friends laughed at him. A lot of young fools in the West End were
making a joke of the Popular Socialist salute. They did it to him
in fashionable restaurants where politics should have a rest; they
did it at race meetings in enclosures and places where he did not
want it done, where he was ready to waive it and be just a
gentleman among gentlemen. Things had come to that. A joke. And
this was his forty-fifth birthday.</p>

<p>He was bored. He had to admit to himself that he was bored by
the whole Popular Socialist movement. Bonina had been very near the
truth of the business in their long and penetrating talk, very near
indeed. That woman had fire in her imagination. She had a way of
illuminating reality with strangely coloured lights. She had
cruelty in her nature and she was not ashamed. She liked things to
hurt. She wanted to hurt and be hurt. She bit. She had left her
mark. She was all for lovers biting&mdash;hard. She wanted an
intensity in life that ordinary everyday living did not give.</p>

<p>How wise she was! Everyone had queer impulses, she insisted, but
the common sort, the "Tag," as Coriolanus put it, suppressed them.
The essence of aristocracy was the ruthless refusal to suppress
oneself. How had she put it? She wanted to <i>wring</i> life. That
put exactly what he had always wanted to do. Once or twice he had
wrung life a bit; when they expelled him from Eton and during his
cadet days, when the chaps chased and hazed him for tying up young
Darlington. After that he had been almost criminally subservient to
the mild appearances of an essentially middle-class society. He had
sinned against his own rich nature. Could there be anything better
in the whole of being than having one's grip on a weakly,
resisting, overpowered, living creature, and doing one's will,
exhausting the grossest fantasy, upon that panting life? All the
noble carnivores exist for that, and are they not the lords of
creation?</p>

<p>He found himself wide awake in a sadistic reverie. He had a
pleasing idea of going back to Bonina and strangling her...</p>

<p>One never knew. She might object and make a row and bring in the
servants. She was capable of the greatest inconsistency. Her talk
was wilder than her spirit. Perhaps she had just been posing at
him. After all&mdash;she was American.</p>

<p>He dozed and then woke into the problem of getting away from
Popular Socialism. In any other country in the world it would have
given him ample scope for terrorism, physical intimidation, lurid
events. As it was, except for one little bit of
discipline&mdash;And there even he had been weak.</p>

<p>He had feared blackmail.</p>

<p>"Ruthlessness," he muttered. "Strange lusts...Quivering
flesh...The Tiger is an
aristocrat...Nietzsche...Strength...Bleating multitude...Bleating
<i>fools</i>...All of them out of tune."</p>

<p>He sank down again into oblivion.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; II</h3>

<p class="first">He slept until nine in the morning and then
touched the bell for the valet, who brought him tea and the
newspapers, whisked away his purple dinner-jacket and black velvet
knee-breeches and departed.</p>

<p>The great carnivore stretched and yawned and stretched
again.</p>

<p>New days have a way of beginning afresh, with a clean page, so
to speak. He had forgotten most of his nocturnal imaginations and
he opened the first paper according to habit to see what space had
been given to his Birthday Festival. He was struck at once by the
head-line: "Popular Socialism still a Living Force. Remarkable
Speech."</p>

<p>What had he said?</p>

<p>"But?" he murmured.</p>

<p>And then in a terrible voice: "My God! what's this?"</p>

<p>The valet answered his furious bell-ringing. He found Lord
Horatio sitting up in his black-and-purple-edged pyjamas on the
bedside. Even the valet appreciated a sort of frightful
handsomeness about him. He was in what valets call "a great
state".</p>

<p>"Get me every morning paper you can," he said. "Tell my
chauffeur to be at the door by half-past nine. Where are my
clothes? Have you run my bath? I have to act, and act at once."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," said the valet.</p>

<p>A note was scribbled to Bonina. "These accursed politics! How
wise you are! But this time I have a chance to hit someone and hit
him hard. You were <i>splendid</i>. Glorious memories."</p>

<p>The great purple car stormed Londonward. Had people by the
roadside cared to look, they might have seen Lord Horatio sitting
still and terrible inside, hatless, arms folded, head slightly bent
forward, occasionally tapping his teeth in earnest thought,
sometimes smiling darkly. But fewer cared to look than Lord Horatio
imagined. They were wrapped up in their own mean little
affairs.</p>

<p>There had been sufficient in the papers for him to realise the
nature of Rud's coup. He despised Rud immeasurably, he feared him
about as much, and he hated him desirously. Rud, dressing irritably
in his meagre little Bloomsbury bedroom, had completely reciprocal
feelings. He despised Lord Horatio without stint, he quivered with
fear at the thought of him, and he craved to defeat, overwhelm and
humiliate him to the utmost. The two of them were coming together
now at an average speed of forty-odd miles per hour.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; III</h3>

<p class="first">From the moment when Lord Horatio pulled up
outside the Purple House he realised that there was a change in the
atmosphere of the place. There were guards in the guardroom of
number sixteen and two in the doorway, but instead of saluting
smartly, they stared at him in a besotted manner and saluted
belatedly. He decided to go into number seventeen. As he fumbled
with his latch-key, Commander Hoggin came swiftly along the
pavement and entered the house on his heels. "All sorts of things
have happened," said Hoggin. "It's&mdash;it's a mutiny."</p>

<p>"Where's Smike?" asked the Boss.</p>

<p>"He's in number sixteen. He'll come if he can."</p>

<p>Lord Horatio led the way to a ground-floor parlour. "Tell me
everything. I've seen the papers. How did that fellow get
loose?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't prevent it. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How did it happen? Never mind 'I.' How did that little beast
jump our platform? How did he get the press he did?"</p>

<p>"There's a gang. It's an organised mutiny, m'lord. Smike
reported on that Camborne Square flat, didn't he? His business to
do so. He's the Intelligence Officer, not me. That rich American
fellow is in it, Steenhold, and Rogers, that big fellow, who runs
Boy Scout boxing clubs in Pimlico and Whitechapel, and there's
Bodisham&mdash;I never trusted Bodisham&mdash;I told you&mdash;and
a lot of them. Some new men. Some men who've come back. Ci-devants.
They're all over number sixteen, waiting for you."</p>

<p>"Have they been in here?"</p>

<p>"How could they? It's kept locked."</p>

<p>"Good. What about Frobisher?"</p>

<p>"Wavering about. I always said that chap was too tall to keep
stiff. The way he let them hustle him on his own
platform&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"What <i>could</i> I do? I control speakers. I don't control the
boys. And he was in command. <i>You</i> put him in command."</p>

<p>Bohun scowled at the faint note of grievance in Hoggin's tone.
"Wait here for a moment," he said. "I shall go right in there
and&mdash;handle them."</p>

<p>He went up to his bedroom. There he brushed his hair and stood
for a time in front of a cheval glass, assembling his personality
to the full. His reflection was satisfactory. He felt stimulated.
He liked his tall, sinister presence rising to an occasion.</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy, I'll show you how to <i>handle</i> things," he
said to an imaginary Rud, and with the habitual rectitude of a born
commander of men, he went downstairs again, rejoined Hoggin and led
the way into number sixteen. He walked through the door of
communication and up to his study, past the first-floor room in
which, as he was acutely aware, Rud, Bodisham and the others
awaited him. "Get me Smike," he said to Hoggin.</p>

<p>He found Mrs. Crumb standing over a young man who was picking up
copies of <i>The Heart and Soul of a Great Leader</i> from a
tumbled heap upon the floor and piling them back on the table. He
vanished at a gesture.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Bohun. "Has anything happened?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what's happening downstairs, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"That dreadful little Whittlelow man suddenly came in just
now&mdash;took no more notice of me than a dog&mdash;and" (her
voice fell to an awe-stricken whisper) "<i>went and sat down in
your chair</i>. Just sat down."</p>

<p>"Did you say anything to him?"</p>

<p>"I said you might not be pleased to see him there. I said it
quietly. Like that. I said, 'Lord Horatio&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"And what did he say?"</p>

<p>"He turned and made a most unpleasant face at me. He <i>is</i>
ugly. But he hadn't a word to say for himself. Not a word, and
presently he got up and walked out of the room. I don't think he
likes me very much."</p>

<p>Smike came in with Hoggin as his lordship seated himself. "Tell
me all about it," he said, leaning back, terrible but calm.</p>

<p>"They're just behind," said Smike, with a backward gesture of
his head.</p>

<p>Rud appeared in the doorway, his face white and tense, with
Rogers and Bodisham at either shoulder. Behind came Steenhold in a
state of ecstatic enjoyment, and Chiffan, almost luminously pale
with happy excitement. Dreed followed helpfully.</p>

<p>Hoggin and Smike placed themselves like ministers in attendance
on Bohun's right.</p>

<p>"To what do I owe this intrusion?" said Lord Horatio, drumming
impatiently on his desk.</p>

<p>"We want to discuss the policy of the Party&mdash;particularly
in relation to America," said Rud.</p>

<p>"Especially in relation to America," echoed Chiffan.</p>

<p>Mrs. Crumb looked enquiringly at her employer. "I shall want a
full note of all this," he said, and she sat down in her usual
place. "And now?" said his lordship.</p>

<p>Rud stood contemplating the desk. Then carefully and
deliberately he pushed aside an inkstand, a large memorandum pad, a
book or two and two tall candle-lamps, placed himself sideways to
the Boss, hoisted and squatted himself firmly on the place he had
made for himself. From this position he proceeded to explain. "You
see, Boss, we hate to say it, but we think that either your grasp
of the world situation is feeble or you aren't acting&mdash;forgive
my frankness&mdash;in perfect good faith."</p>

<p>"Do you mind <i>not</i> sitting on my desk?" said Lord
Horatio.</p>

<p>"You don't provide chairs, you see," said Rud, looking down at
him with quiet hatred and not offering to budge.</p>

<p>"Still&mdash;"</p>

<p>He considered the difficulty in a generous spirit. "Dreed,
there, would you mind going downstairs and making one or two of
those youngsters bring up some chairs? Then we can all sit decently
and have a proper confabulation. For confabulate, my lord, we
<i>must</i>. As I was saying, we feel our party has enormous
possibilities. And they are not being realised. Are you prepared to
discuss that with us?"</p>

<p>His lordship thought swiftly. No good starting a fight here. The
odds were six to three. And this was not the place for it. Cold
contempt and deliberation were indicated.</p>

<p>"And what is this discussion to be about?" he said.</p>

<p>"The country wants a lead. We are giving the country no
lead."</p>

<p>"The country is inert."</p>

<p>"The country is as quiet as unlit gunpowder."</p>

<p>"You have my lead <i>there</i>." Lord Horatio gestured to his
piled pamphlet. "There you have my <i>Mein Kampf</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Mein Kampf</i> was full of ideas&mdash;definite ideas. It
told the Germans exactly what to do. <i>That</i> stuff is
just&mdash;personal tootling. It tells nobody anything to do. We
want a lead as well as a leader. We want a clear statement of
ideas. We want a meeting of the Party to clear up our aims."</p>

<p>Rud paused. Bohun under great provocation remained calm and
quiet.</p>

<p>"You want dasapline," he said with quiet intensity. "You want to
get these Bloomsbury plus Whitechapel ideas of yours together and
then&mdash;wash them all out. That, my boy, is what you want."</p>

<p>"At a meeting?"</p>

<p>"At a meeting? Certainly."</p>

<p>"A show-down?"</p>

<p>"A clean-up. We will have a Dasapline meeting. I agree.
Certainly I agree. The Party wants gingering up. You are right
about that, anyhow. Maybe it needs a purge, a drastic purge. A
conference, a confrontation, and no outside interference. Just
among ourselves. That little Canton Hall round the corner here is
big enough. A nice quiet little place. A ticket meeting&mdash;and
no gloves on. No gloves on, mind you."</p>

<p>"You'll fix a date?"</p>

<p>"As soon as you like. What do you think of next week,
Hoggin?"</p>

<p>"Sooner the better," said Smike.</p>

<p>Dreed and his chairs and helpers arrived belatedly in the
doorway.</p>

<p>"We shan't want these chairs now," said Rud, getting off the
desk. "We've done our business for the moment. There will have to
be a small organising committee, of course."</p>

<p>"Smike," said Bohun. "Hoggin."</p>

<p>"Bodisham," said Rud.</p>

<p>"<i>You?</i>"</p>

<p>"Neither you nor me, Boss."</p>

<p>His lordship considered. "Perhaps best not. No...Dasapline," he
said, and some pleasant thoughts seemed to cross his mind. "No
reporters. Just ourselves. Smike, Hoggin, Bodisham."</p>

<p>Somebody said: "Frobisher."</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Rud.</p>

<p>"Four is enough," said Bohun, and added a touch that was almost
in the Coriolanus vein. "And now perhaps you will allow me
to&mdash;ah&mdash;<i>ventilate</i> my room. You have made a note of
all this, Mrs. Crumb? You will let this Mr. Whittlelow and Mr.
Bodisham and the other recalcitrant gentlemen have
copies?...Enough."</p>

<p>He made a gesture of masterful dismissal for which Rud had no
immediate repartee. He regarded Rud with an expression of serene
malignity. He had no doubt now that the situation had been handled.
Now he would show them. And as for that white tadpole dressed up as
a man...!</p>

<p>Before Rud could devise any effective counter, Steenhold had
taken him by the arm. "That's all settled," said Steenhold, and led
him from the room.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; IV</h3>

<p class="first">"It's a queer thing," said Mr. Montague Abrahams,
the manager of Keen and Battle, who did most of the printing for
the Popular Socialist Party in those days; "I have had three
distinct orders for tickets for this Strictly Private Meeting of
the Party, all on the Party paper and all signed by names I know.
There's that Mr. Frobisher, who's conducted their meetings before.
I suppose he's all O.K. He wants three hundred tickets sent to
Headquarters at number sixteen. Perfectly in order. Yes. In
addition we get a private order from Lord Horatio himself for a
hundred to be sent to him 'Personal' at number seventeen. Good. But
then here comes an order from Mr. Bodisham who was in charge last
year, and he wants a hundred and fifty to go to this address in
Camborne Square. Now that hall won't hold much more than four
hundred people. I suppose it's all <i>right</i> so far as we are
concerned, but&mdash;It's funny. I've had an idea of O.K.-ing all
these orders with Headquarters. And yet I've got a sort of feeling
that maybe I would be butting in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The money's all right?" said Mrs. Abrahams.</p>

<p>"Well, the only point there might be a doubt about is about that
Camborne Square part of the order. But they've paid that already.
Mr. Bodisham called. I saw him. <i>Quiet</i>-looking young
gentleman. Round-shouldered&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't interfere," said Mrs. Abrahams after reflection.
"There's wheels within wheels."</p>

<p>"You keep your fingers out of the wheels, Monty," said Mrs.
Abrahams.</p>

<p>Mr. Abrahams went on with his supper. "This political printing
is very interesting work," he said.</p>

<p>"Interested is all very well," said Mrs. Abrahams, "but don't
get excited about it."</p>

<p>Mr. Abrahams said no more until his supper was done. Then he
said, almost as though he soliloquised:</p>

<p>"Maybe I'll just go round and have a look at Canton Hall on the
night. Maybe they'll overflow a bit."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; V</h3>

<p class="first">There was little excitement outside the Canton
Hall when the hour of the meeting arrived. It was a private meeting
of the Party and there were no police precautions in evidence. Men
and youths arrived by twos and threes and were swallowed up by the
portals. But presently there were shouts within.</p>

<p>Mr. Abrahams could not distinguish anything of the shouting. It
grew louder and then there was laughter and more laughter&mdash;a
jeering sort of laughter.</p>

<p>He made a move towards the door and then restrained himself and
turned away.</p>

<p>Whistling pensively, Mr. Abrahams strolled to the corner of the
road which ran towards the corner house. He glanced about him
furtively. He was unobserved. Very quickly he produced a red ticket
from his breast pocket, a ticket he had over-printed, he looked at
it for a moment with his head appreciatively on one side, shifted
it conveniently to his outer pocket, slapped it, and then, with an
entire change of bearing, marched back to the Hall, presented his
illicit credential, and pushed his way into a room already
completely packed.</p>

<p>"Quite at the back," he whispered, as if to an absent Mrs.
Abrahams. "Quite at the back."</p>

<p>He remained an unobtrusive but appreciative spectator of all
that followed. He tried to make a rough computation of the number
of people present. It astonished him that there was still room to
breathe. He reckoned up about four hundred, four hundred-odd. But
he had printed&mdash;what had he printed?&mdash;five hundred and
fifty. And one.</p>

<p>"They can't have come. If they were turned away I should have
seen them outside."</p>

<p>The four men appointed to organise the secret meeting had
behaved very much in the manner of seconds preparing for a duel.
Very plainly it was a duel. It was to be held, they had agreed,
with an absolute minimum of notification. All the tickets were to
be stamped <i>Private and Confidential</i>. The outside public was
to know nothing about it. Both sides had insisted that there was
absolutely no need for police, no need for any sort of publicity at
all. "It is just a little matter among ourselves." That had been
accepted with what was afterwards recognised as suspicious alacrity
by both sides.</p>

<p>After that there had been some cautious diplomacy about the
agenda. Neither side was prepared to name a chairman. "We want a
sort of non-interventionist," said Bodisham. "We want our
principals to have the amplest play."</p>

<p>The organisers pitched at last upon Frobisher.</p>

<p>It was Lord Horatio's desire that Rud should open with his case.
And he didn't want to hear Rud open his case. It would certainly
bore him, he said, and he might get indignant and interrupt. He
wanted to give Rud fair play. Rud could have all the rope he needed
to hang himself. Rud could have the meeting to himself for his
charges against the leadership, and at the psychological moment
Lord Horatio would come in, come forward and state his own
position. "Practically, what Rud will say will be on the lines of
the Hyde Park speech?" Hoggin assumed.</p>

<p>"Practically," said Bodisham ambiguously.</p>

<p>It was not in the philosophy of either Bohun or Hoggin that
Rud&mdash;or indeed anyone&mdash;could make an entirely different
speech&mdash;several different speeches. For the Bohunites, one's
speech was one's speech like one's height or one's complexion.</p>

<p>"There is a verbatim report?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Crumb has been given a copy."</p>

<p>"You want Rud to fire off his ammunition first and then, you
want Lord Horatio to come in and jump on him?" said Bodisham,
shaking his head.</p>

<p>"We give him the opening," said Hoggin.</p>

<p>"Any right of reply?"</p>

<p>"Do you think that will be needed?"</p>

<p>"I suppose we must agree to that," said Bodisham with an air of
reluctance. "I don't like it. He will have to start from cold. No.
It's not fair..."</p>

<p>So that what Mr. Abrahams came in for first, when he wriggled
into the back of the Canton Hall, was Rud's opening address. And if
Rud had started from cold, he had taken a remarkably short time to
develop a high temperature. He was indulging in a tirade against
Lord Horatio, a torrent or abuse and insult that would have made
Milton's controversial style seem propitiatory and Tertullian a
gentleman.</p>

<p>"And there wasn't to be a reporter present," whispered Mr.
Abrahams to himself, appreciatively, counting three men within
range who were more or less overtly making notes. Oh! This is
<i>jam</i>."</p>

<p>And the things Whitlow kept saying! Abrahams could hardly
believe his ears.</p>

<p>He was not only saying them. He was getting away with them. He
was provoking angry shouts and abusive cries, but he was getting
support and more support.</p>

<p>"Hear what I've got to say," shouted Rud. "Hear what I've got to
say."</p>

<p>Uproar.</p>

<p>"This is a private meeting of the Party and if you don't agree
with me&mdash;say it afterwards. But hear my case."</p>

<p>The majority was for him. No doubt of it. Abrahams' arithmetic
was swift and sound.</p>

<p>If that other hundred try to get in, he resolved, I quit. What
was he saying?</p>

<p>"I tell you we've had this&mdash;this Guy making us ridiculous
long enough. I tell you he's not leading. I tell you he's standing
in our way. He's selling us to Bankers and rich Americans. He's
setting us against the trade unionists and Communists who have a
case&mdash;a poor case, but they have a case. He's doing nothing
for the Socialist cause, while <i>our</i> navy, our navy, the navy
this country pays for, bombards American workers' homes...He's
making mischief for us with the Jews.</p>

<p>"What's the sense of quarrelling with Jews?"</p>

<p>Abrahams applauded internally.</p>

<p>"Do they do any harm here? Do people mind them? But that's the
game they played in Germany and so here&mdash;where everything is
different&mdash;where never in the whole of history has there been
such a thing as a pogrom&mdash;we have to do likewise! Just to
split the workers...</p>

<p>"Come to think of it:&mdash;he looks half a Jew himself, a
ginger-white Jew, the worst sort...</p>

<p>"I've got no quarrel with a Jew as such&mdash;Who <i>has</i>
here?&mdash;but these anti-Jews and these pro-Jews are poison. It's
a stale old quarrel from the Middle Ages. Who wants that rotten
quarrel in <i>our</i> new world? To hell with all this
Jew-consciousness, either way! I tell you it's a <i>new</i> world
we're living in&mdash;and we want to get on with it and get it in
order. Who wants to play Jews against Gentiles, Catholics against
Protestants, Socialists against Individualists, Sunnites against
Shiites now? It's all old stuff. It's dead stuff. It's
Yesterday-ism. Politics from Petticoat Lane. What I say about these
Jews is, smash up the Ghetto and let them run. We want New Against
Old&mdash;and this leader who has been pretending to lead us is so
old, so stale; he's sort of antiquarian. He's a curio. He's a
collector...I could tell you things...But never mind that."</p>

<p>("Is he ready, Bodisham?"&mdash;" a swift aside.</p>

<p>"He's quite ready.")</p>

<p>"I said he looks half a Jew. I apologise to the Jews. Anyhow,
he's selling you old clothes, boys. Do you want to be dressed up in
second-hand Dago tights? Do you want to strut about with your
chests and your behinds stuck out, doing comic gladiator salutes?
You Englishmen? Salute. Hand out. Can I leave the room please?
Eh?...We who are about to die salute you, Horatio!...<i>Bah!</i> We
want the reality of our own sort. Look here! Here's the sort of
animal <i>he</i> wants to make of you!"</p>

<p>And forthwith a masked figure mounted the steps at the back of
the platform and marched forward, with a sort of staccato
goose-step, giving the Popular Socialist salute. It halted, still
saluting. It turned this way and that. It opened a large mouth and
drummed thoughtfully at its pasteboard teeth.</p>

<p>It was a turn that one of the Sunday evening music-hall group at
Steenhold's flat had improvised, and which Steenhold had insisted
upon making a feature of this debate. The mask was a cleverly
simplified caricature of Bohun's visage and the ginger wig and
forelock might have been the Boss's natural hair. The apparition
took the meeting's breath away and then, after a silence, the crowd
broke into a confusion of booing, applause and protests. But the
protests were in a minority, and the noise died down to listen as
Rud proceeded, after the manner of a showman:</p>

<p>"That's the model Bohun gave us...Yes&mdash;you can shout
<i>shame!</i> but <i>that's</i> shame...</p>

<p>"No, don't howl now. You'll have your turn to say things."</p>

<p>Somebody in the front of the hall had to be suppressed. But the
very crowding of the hall helped to keep the peace. They were too
jammed together there for anything but pushing, face-thrusting and
elbow fighting. No one could swing for a kick or a punch.</p>

<p>"Look at him, I say. Do you see how tight he is behind, boys?
See his rump? <i>Ain't</i> it a behind? It beats his chest, don't
it? <i>Look</i> how it sticks out! <i>Why?</i>"</p>

<p>Various suggestions were made amidst raucous laughter.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," Rud went on. "He's got his tail there, mates.
Hidden in his pants. It's a monkey. That's what it is. A nice
furry-tailed Capuchin monkey. It's a performing monkey on old
Mussolini's organ, and it only dances to foreign tunes. Popular
Socialist he calls himself&mdash;patriot and all that&mdash;and not
a home-grown idea from start to finish! Can't we do better than
that? On our own? I ask you...</p>

<p>"Walk up and down the platform, Horry-boy. There you are, the
very picture of him. Salute, please. That's the hero of the society
Judys. That's the darling of dear old Lady Ragbag. And our
spirited, pro-Nazi, Lady Garbees, who spends her whole life trying
not to speak with a nasty native American accent. And old Lady
Twinkletoes. And all the rest of them. Eh? Give me a good rough Red
every time, if it comes to that. Not that I hold with that Moscow
stuff for a moment. That's stale, too. But dammit, if they're
muddle-headed, they're <i>real</i>. This&mdash;this isn't
politics." (Angry Voice: "No, it isn't politics." Replies and a
slight struggle to suppress the angry voice.) "It's private
theatricals."</p>

<p>"Yus!" said the angry voice, and something happened to it; it
went under for good.</p>

<p>Something was happening at the back of the platform. "What!"
said Bodisham. "Already? Right. <i>Here</i>&mdash;" to the
effigy&mdash;"you just stand back for a moment."</p>

<p>The masker was pushed into a corner and out of sight behind the
group of B.M.G.s.</p>

<p>Rud wound up his speech.</p>

<p>"Well, I've made most of my case! Here's Lord Horatio himself,
the great original, ten minutes before his time. But I've said
enough, Mr. Chairman. I think I've said enough. Now let us hear
what Lord Horatio has to say for himself <i>once more</i>."</p>

<p>"Those other tickets," checked Mr. Abrahams. "A hundred more of
them. And I'm as flat as a pancake already now!"</p>

<p>He tried to edge towards the door, but unavailingly.</p>

<p>Frobisher was gesticulating with his long limbs for the platform
crowd to clear the way from behind. And then Mr. Abrahams perceived
Hoggin and Smike opening a path for the advance of Lord
Horatio.</p>

<p>It was always his way to advance upon a meeting slowly,
portentously. In spite of the congestion of the platform he did so
now. He arrived amidst an unusually thin applause at the front,
raised his arm in a dignified salute and stood silently radiating
his personality upon the audience. Beside him, and a little behind
him, was Frobisher. By contrast with these two tall figures Rud
looked gnome-like, lacking in dignity, inferior. Yet also he looked
much more alive and malignant. A lull in the shouting ensued.
Expectation stilled the crowd. Then on the right the masquerader
reappeared, advanced sublimely and struck an attitude exactly
parallel with Lord Horatio's.</p>

<p>There was not much laughter. It was funny in a derisive way. It
was not, however, hilariously funny. It produced guffaws rather
than merriment, and everyone was alert for the next incident, which
was the realisation of this mocking presence by Bohun himself.</p>

<p>He turned and saw his parody.</p>

<p>He should have featured outraged dignity, but he was too
astonished. Sublimity vanished. "You mean to make out I'm like
<i>that!</i>" he cried, and then, advancing with upraised fist,
"You silly Ape, you!"</p>

<p>Then he paused for a moment and cried to Hoggin: "Bring our men
in <i>now!</i>" he cried.</p>

<p>"I <i>knew</i> it," whispered Mr. Abrahams. "A hundred of 'em!"
For a crucial moment his face was jammed against the broad, back of
the man in front of him. When he got a clear view of the platform
again Bohun was grappling with Rogers, who had intervened between
him and his pseudo-double; the masker and one or two others of the
platform crowd had been pushed right over the edge and on to the
front rows of the audience; and the chairman, who had become as
long-limbed it seemed as a gibbon, had produced a bell which he was
not so much ringing as using as an impartial mace upon the heads
about him. A wedge of toughs had appeared from the back of the
platform in response to Bohun's cry. One extremely ugly face stood
out among these newcomers, and Abrahams seemed to recognise it as
the face of the Terrible Slew, the all-in wrestler. Then he felt
sure it <i>was</i> the Terrible Slew. "Gollys!" Rud had been pushed
against the wall to the left of the platform and was apparently
having difficulty in keeping his footing and not being shoved down
into the hall. He was hitting about weakly with one fist and seemed
then to be resisting pressure rather than actually fighting.</p>

<p>But it was very hard to grasp the situation as a whole and Mr.
Abrahams found his powers of observation confused by the danger of
being trodden on and crushed, and by a desire to pull back a chair
against the wall and stand on it and see more. There were too many
heads and too much minor action between him and the drama on the
stage. Everyone was standing up and a lot of men were kneeling and
standing on the chairs. The chairs were having a bad time, cracking
and collapsing with a sort of squelch. The general thrust, happily
for little Mr. Abrahams, was towards the platform.</p>

<p>So far as he could grasp the situation, the hall had been packed
against Lord Horatio, but now a formidable counterattack from the
back entrance had been unmasked. "Slew!" said Mr. Abrahams. "He'll
<i>hurt</i> somebody."</p>

<p>A lot of people were shouting: "We <i>want</i> Rud Whitlow!" But
that cry was not sweeping the meeting. It was just as if some cue
had gone wrong. "We want Rud!" bawled a youngster close to
Abraham's ear. "Why aren't you shouting, sir? What's the matter
with <i>you?</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm neutral," said Mr. Abrahams.</p>

<p>"Neutral are you? Then what the devil are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"I'm the printer."</p>

<p>"Printer be damned. You lift your voice, sir, and show your
colours."</p>

<p>"I <i>want</i> Rud!" shouted Abrahams perfunctorily. "What's
happening now?"</p>

<p>The attention of the young man who had challenged him was
happily diverted.</p>

<p>The milling crowd on the left of the platform reminded Abrahams
of swarming bees. He saw a chair-leg go spinning across the hall to
no definite address. Somebody in the front row began yelping
shrilly with pain.</p>

<p>Bohun, the Terrible Slew, Rogers and Steenhold towered over the
swaying platform battle and there seemed to be a convergence of
conflict towards the back entrance. And then there were cries of
"Where is Rud? What are they doing to Rud?"</p>

<p>Someone quite near to Abrahams said: "They've got hold of
Rud..."</p>

<p>Someone was blowing a policeman's whistle outside.</p>

<p>A voice of agony sounded quite near to Mr. Abrahams.</p>

<p>"I'm the caretaker of the bloody place. A quiet meeting. They
said it was to be a quiet, friendly meeting. Not a <i>single</i>
policeman. Oh, my God! my God! The <i>chairs!</i> Who's going to
pay for them chairs?"</p>

<p>Then there was a cracking of timber as part of the platform gave
way.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VI</h3>

<p class="first">Rud was kidnapped before he realised what was
happening to him. He was hitting out with his left in order to
protect his face from imaginary blows, and he thought at first that
it was friendly hands that were thrusting him away from the
dangerous corner of the platform. A lot of heavy men were slogging
and shouting their way in a line across the platform towards the
body of the hall, and it seemed reasonable to duck and push in the
opposite direction. His pushing was assisted. He heard Dreed and
someone else shouting: "Look out, Rud." Then he fell down some
steps, felt his ankle twist rather painfully, and found himself in
the open air and being hauled towards Bohun's car. His jacket was
pulled over his head and his collar seemed about to strangle him
and then tore with a ripping sound. He resisted at the door of the
car and was hit under his jaw-bone in a way that seemed to reduce
his face to an uncontrollable jumble of features and obliterate his
mind for a time.</p>

<p>He seemed to hear Dreed saying: "Here! Hold on. Wait a
bit"&mdash;and then groan.</p>

<p>Someone had hit Dreed on the head...</p>

<p>After a lapse Rud found he was being carried like a sack up some
steps, the steps of a house.</p>

<p>"What's all this here?" asked a voice.</p>

<p>"All right, constable. One of our men a bit hurt. We'll see to
him..."</p>

<p>He was being bumped along the passage of some house. Probably it
was the Purple House...</p>

<p>It seemed wiser not to struggle until he got the hang of the
affair. He pretended insensibility. He was carried quite a long and
complicated way, round a corner, downstairs, and along a passage,
and finally he was flung down on a flat surface.</p>

<p>A door slammed and bolts were shot.</p>

<p>An almost complete silence ensued...</p>

<p>Slowly and apparently against great resistances his dislocated
face seemed to be reassembling itself. He opened one eye and part
of another and listened intently. Very stiffly and painfully he sat
up.</p>

<p>He found he was exactly where he had been trying to think he
wasn't. He was locked up in one of those cells in number
seventeen.</p>

<p>Anyhow, it was a clean one.</p>

<p>In one corner of the cell was a Thermos pitcher. That probably
contained water. He felt he would very much like to assuage the
flaming ache of his face with some cold water, and he got up
painfully and hobbled over to it. But no one had ever put any water
into that Thermos pitcher.</p>

<p>He sat down again on the plank bed and contemplated the
situation. There was nothing else for him to do...He went on
contemplating the situation...</p>

<p>His thoughts at first were heavy and sluggish and inclined to
repeat themselves; then they quickened up and became feverish and
incoherent. But they remained uniformly disagreeable.</p>

<p>He had been kidnapped and Lord Horatio had got him.</p>

<p>The Group had been so cocksure about this meeting, all of them.
It was to have dispelled Bohun in a storm of ridicule.</p>

<p>It should have done.</p>

<p>But it had failed to do so, and here he was&mdash;the Leader!
Bashed and in a cell. They had made a mess of things and got
beaten...</p>

<p>Rud's realisation of defeat was very rapid. He saw now that it
was an altogether inevitable defeat...</p>

<p>The fact of it was Bodisham was a rotten organiser&mdash;a lousy
organiser. The rottenest of organisers. He ought to have organised
an intelligence department. Of course, he ought to have done that.
He ought to have known what Bohun was up to. He ought to have been
ready for a counter-attack. He ought to have been sure that a
counter-attack would come.</p>

<p>This was the Group's first fight and it had been beaten. The
Group had been a promise, a dream. This cell was reality. The Group
was done for at the first round.</p>

<p>The clearer Rud's mind grew, the clearer grew his conviction of
sin, folly, presumption and incompetence. (And now he had to wait
for what was coming to him.)</p>

<p>He thought Steenhold's notion of bringing in that masked actor
was one of the rottenest ideas he had ever heard of. Absolutely the
rottenest idea. But Steenhold always had been a fool&mdash;just as
Bodisham was a fool. Steenhold had seen some public enquiry about
Banking methods at Washington turned to absurdity by introducing a
midget and getting the creature to sit on Pierpoint Morgan's knee
while he was being questioned. This music-hall turn had been
Steenhold's silly imitation of that. How he had loved the idea! How
he had insisted upon it and elaborated it!</p>

<p>Chiffan ought to have warned Rud against it. But there was a
malicious streak in Chiffan. There were times when he seemed
positively pleased to see everything going wrong. Sometimes you
felt you could trust him absolutely and then came that irritating
note of derision that filled you with doubt. Why had he fallen in
with this fancy of Steenhold's? Because it was effective or simply
because it was preposterous? Far better it would have been to have
had a straightforward confrontation with Bohun, more political,
more statesmanlike. If only he had not given way to Chiffan and
trusted instead to his own sounder instinct!</p>

<p>Too late now...</p>

<p>Rogers was just a beefy rough. He was an escape from the
National Sporting Club. He had no business in politics. He had been
convinced that with these wonderful boxing youngsters of his from
Pimlico and Whitechapel he could hold the meeting in order and make
it possible to carry the whole scheme through. Well, he had failed.
The whole Group had failed. Rogers had wanted a fight and he had
had a fight, and he hadn't cared a rap whose career was wrecked in
the process. And so Rud had begun his career with his Waterloo.
(And here he was landed, with his face in a pulp, waiting for what
was coming to him...)</p>

<p>How long would he have to wait...?</p>

<p>And what would happen when Bohun came...? Discipline? What would
Bohun dare to do?</p>

<p>It was remarkable that Bohun had not come already. No doubt that
crew of roughs were cleaning up Rogers and his amateurs in the
Canton Hall. Maybe Bohun would have to make things right with the
police. There had been a blowing of police whistles and apparently
a policeman had seen Rud carried into the Purple House. Would they
come and take him out of it, and if so, what would happen? But
would anyone know he was down here? How would anyone know who it
was they had carried in? Dreed knew he had been carried off, but
apparently Dreed had been knocked out. None of the others knew.
They might not miss him for a long time. They might not be able to
get together. No. Here he was and here he was likely to
remain&mdash;until Bohun saw fit to attend to him. No reason for
Bohun to hurry...</p>

<p>He looked at his wrist-watch to see how the time was going. But
half the glass of the watch had gone and the minute hand was bent
up. That was annoying. He seemed to have been here quite a long
time, but he could not tell whether he had been lying stunned for
five minutes or an hour. How could he manage to reckon? And anyhow,
what was the good of reckoning?</p>

<p>Suddenly the light in his cell went out. That took him by
surprise and he gave a startled cry.</p>

<p>What did that mean?</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>Or perhaps a lot.</p>

<p>Unnecessary and undesirable phrases came floating into his mind.
"Dead of night," for example. Something very secret and very
sinister done at the dead of night. When all the honest, kindly
world was fast asleep and beyond call.</p>

<p>He was intolerably thirsty.</p>

<p>That might be part of it. They might keep him here without food
and drink, just to weaken him, break him down before Discipline
began.</p>

<p>They couldn't very well carry things so far as to kill him. Not
deliberately.</p>

<p>But they might carry Discipline so far as to kill him
unintentionally. In England?</p>

<p>"Why not in England?" said his memory of Chiffan.</p>

<p>Oh! why had he ever launched upon this business? What is the
good of meddling with politics unless you are prepared for
violence&mdash;unless you can stand hard knocks? He had been fool
enough to let these others flatter him into the position of a
leader. It had been fun for them, but he had been fool enough to be
serious about it&mdash;drink it all in...</p>

<p>He might have kept clear of all this from the beginning. He
might have concentrated on taking an outstanding Camford degree. He
could have read law. With this gift of eloquence of his, he would
have made a brilliant advocate...</p>

<p>No good thinking of that now...</p>

<p>After all, maybe, his father hadn't been such an utter fool,
about the dangers of an aggressive temperament and a nimble
tongue...</p>

<p>His thoughts were wandering to unimportant matters. It was
difficult to think clearly with this aching face; it seemed as
though his brain as well as his jaw was askew. But he had to think
clearly and hard and exhaustively before the next thing
happened.</p>

<p>Perhaps the enemy was not so clever after all in giving him this
endless vigil in the dark to think things out. What was he going to
do?</p>

<p>What he had straight in front of him, what he had to deal with
first, was Bohun.</p>

<p>Would it be possible to make some sort of compromise with that
dangerous fool? Would it be wiser to humbug him or menace him?
Suppose, for example, one stood up when he appeared and gave him
that damned salute of his? Suppose one said: "I know when I am
beaten. This ends politics for me": would he swallow that?</p>

<p>Suppose one said: "I realise now the meaning of Personality,
Boss"&mdash;or "I realise now the meaning of Personality, Lord
Horatio": how would he take that?</p>

<p>"<i>Gods!</i>" said Rud, "I don't think I would do that even
now."</p>

<p>The beast might just laugh that neighing laugh of his. Vain he
was, but also he was cruel.</p>

<p>Perhaps one might say it, less cringingly...</p>

<p>One might offer to make some sort of alliance...As man to
man...</p>

<p>And even if one could get by him like that, then what was the
outlook for Rud? What chance was there of rallying the old group
and explaining oneself to them all?</p>

<p>Rud's attempts to envisage the situation in all its aspects
suddenly gave way to a fit of hearty cursing. "Damn you all and
damn everything," said Rud, and embroidered that theme.</p>

<p>Which was his way of resigning himself to the conclusion that he
had to go through with that Discipline, whatever it was. "Whatever
it is," said Rud, clenching his fists until his nails hurt his
palms. "I'll get square with him afterwards. I'll get square with
him. If I give my life for it."</p>

<p>Then came a phase of lassitude that seemed to last an
interminable time, and then his mind was busy again planning where
he should go and what he should do after he had got home again,
whatever was left of him.</p>

<p>"For whatever happens," he said, "they can't kill me. They can't
kill me. In England&mdash;"</p>

<p>After that a sort of dull period and then a fresh bout of blind
cursing.</p>

<p>No earthly way of checking the time at all. For all he could
tell it might be morning already. In this infernal darkness one
hardly knew whether one was right way up or upside down. They ought
to give him a light. Common humanity&mdash;</p>

<p>No use shouting.</p>

<p>He wished someone would come.</p>

<p>To judge by his throat and the stiffening of his bruises he must
have been here for long hours. Whatever they might do to him, one
thing they would certainly have to do to him, and that was to give
him a drink.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was morning. Maybe Bohun was sleeping off his
exertions before coming down to him.</p>

<p>("Equal with him somehow.")</p>

<p>He passed into a reverie of reprisals.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VII</h3>

<p class="first">When at last he heard footsteps coming he doubted
whether he wanted anyone to come. He forgot what he had meant to
say. He wanted time to think that out again.</p>

<p>What was he going to say? "This finishes politics for me. I know
when I'm beaten?"</p>

<p>No good to begin like that.</p>

<p>The steps came nearer. A faint light flickered through the
inspection wicket and flickered away again. It was like the flicker
of an electric torch. His heart was now beating very fast. Someone
rattled the door. A voice outside asked: "Anyone here?"</p>

<p>Very like Irwell's voice, but you couldn't be sure. Better keep
still. Pretend to be asleep?</p>

<p>Then came another quite familiar voice. "Rud!"</p>

<p>Rud leapt to his feet: "Chiffan! <i>Chiffan!</i> Is that you?"
Chiffan's voice, high-pitched and cheerful: "Here he is! Where the
hell are those keys?"</p>

<p>And then instantly the light went on again...Somebody was saying
something about a fuse.</p>

<p>A key turned in the lock, the door opened and Chiffan stood with
a pallid, triumphant face, regarding his leader. "What is it? Is it
still Thursday?"</p>

<p>"Still Thursday, Rud! How long do you think you have been
here?"</p>

<p>"Eternity."</p>

<p>"You can't have been in this place much more than three-quarters
of an hour."</p>

<p>"I was knocked out. I've been insensible. I've been dreaming.
What I want first of all is a drink of water. I've got a fever on
me. Then a wash."</p>

<p>"What you want is a whisky and soda. Then someone ought to
bandage you up."</p>

<p>"But tell me what has happened?"</p>

<p>"Here's Rogers. Rogers, here he is!"</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" asked Rogers.</p>

<p>"Nothing. Tell me."</p>

<p>"It's gone like clockwork. <i>What</i> a scrap! A <i>lovely</i>
scrap! And right in the heart of the West End. Nothing like it for
years. Poor old Horry!"</p>

<p>"What's happened to him?"</p>

<p>"He got a kick in the groin. You should have heard him howl.
What a voice he has for the Wilderness! But he's
hurt&mdash;decidedly hurt...I'm sorry about that. I don't like
things happening like that. There's a limit to things. I hope it
was accidental. But the rest of the fight was fair and square. I
suppose you didn't see one of my Whitechapel kids tackle that
all-in man, you know, the Terrible Slew? Dodged his kick and caught
his heel and over he went. Just before the platform upset. I
thought he'd broken his neck. 'Subsequent proceedings interested
<i>him</i> no more.'...</p>

<p>"Or maybe he thought he'd earned his pay. A lot of those roughs
seemed to get heart failure when they saw what they had to deal
with. They thought they were just there to beat up a meeting and
get hold of you. There was some dirty work with razor-blades, but
that was Horry's old lot. Not our chaps, I hope. None of <i>my</i>
boys certainly. But&mdash;this scrap's going to be historical. In
the heart of Tyburnia. The police were pretty late. They seemed a
bit surprised to find us in charge and their old friend Horry
doubled up and yelping like a puppy that's been run over.</p>

<p>"Where Horry got all those roughs of his I don't know. He must
have a criminal connection somewhere. One or two the Inspector told
me were certainly old lags. He got quite friendly with us. Didn't
seem to fancy Horry...Half of them didn't know each other, often
they were just slogging blind, but my boys knew each other down to
the ground. Anyhow, it was the greatest scrap you ever!...It
<i>was</i> a great scrap."</p>

<p>Rud was still sitting on the plank bed, but his leadership was
reconstituting itself very rapidly in his mind. When he spoke
again, he spoke as the Chief and everyone listened.</p>

<p>"Here we are," he said. "Except for my temporary obliteration,
the whole thing's evidently gone like clockwork. Eh? As we planned
it. We've put it over&mdash;thanks to Bodisham and
Steenhold&mdash;and now the thing is to&mdash;what's the military
phrase?&mdash;consolidate the position. What's the right time? My
watch is smashed. We must get on to all the press resources
available and explain quite clearly what it was all about. 'Thrice
is he armed that hath his quarrel just, But he wins out who gets
his tale in fust!' We must have photographers. I'll talk to every
interviewer that reads and writes."</p>

<p>"But upstairs!" said Irwell. "We've found things. Pictures and
things."</p>

<p>"Publish everything."</p>

<p>"But you know&mdash;he was a bit of a stinker!"</p>

<p>"Release his stink," said Rud.</p>

<p>Within half an hour Rud was in Bohun's coveted chair, heroically
bandaged and heroically talking. The newspaper men stood or walked
about. ("If we have chairs up here they'll park themselves," said
Rud, taking an entirely new view of the seating question.)
Sustained by whisky and soda and an injection of strychnine, he
expounded himself lucidly, carefully, and over and over again. It
was urgently necessary for the public to understand what had
happened. For a long time the Party had been baffled and nonplussed
by the increasingly eccentric behaviour of its leader. He had
arrested what was essentially a great common-sense movement of the
Anglo-American people&mdash;the common people&mdash;</p>

<p>"Eh? What was that?" said one of the reporters.
"Anglo-American?"</p>

<p>Rud repeated his words very seriously. "Anglo-American common
people."</p>

<p>They had tried to reason with Bohun; they had meant to have an
entirely private discussion; but his Lordship had thought better of
it. Or worse of it...</p>

<p>"You can take your cameras all over the Purple House now, and I
think you will realise what we were up against. You'll find some
queer things. It's yielding up its secrets. But see for
yourselves..."</p>

<p>"It's a great story," said one of the news-hawks.</p>

<p>"You don't know the half of it yet," said Chiffan.</p>

<p>"And now," said Rud, "the really significant news. The Popular
Socialist Party will go ahead. It has rescued itself. It is free.
It is rejuvenescent. And it is a natural and necessary Party. It
has the vitality of reality. The main points. Listen! What does it
stand for? Let me give you our main points exactly over again. How
else could it have survived Bohun? No. I'm not a bit fagged. These
bandages make talking a bit painful, but that's all. They'll be
stiffer to-morrow. I told you how I got this slog on the jaw.
Otherwise I should have carried on. But Rogers did that
marvellously. Let me talk about the Party and its Future. That's
what I want to talk about. The scrap won't make half as good a
story unless you put it against its proper background. I'd better
get it over now. Not a <i>bit</i> fatigued. Go on writing. I'll
take on all you newspaper men, one down, another come up. It is the
Party of the common man; It's common sense <i>insisting</i> on
itself, through me...</p>

<p>"Don't think I am a leader. Don't think I'm setting up to be
another Lord Horry. I'm no leader. I'm just the megaphone of common
sense. Get that&mdash;the megaphone of common sense. But listen to
common sense. What are we going to do next? I'll tell you."</p>

<p>And so forth and so on.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VIII</h3>

<p class="first">It was nearly one in the morning when Mr. Abrahams
came home.</p>

<p>He opened the conversation as he came into the bedroom. "I'm not
a bit drunk," he said, "I haven't touched anything this evening.
I've been making history."</p>

<p>"Where have you been, Monty, making your history? You
<i>sound</i> excited."</p>

<p>"I went to that meeting, darling. The one in Canton Hall. I
couldn't keep away. I got a sort of oh <i>quite</i> accidental
punch in the eye, but I don't think it's going to colour. I was hit
by a potato. At one time they were throwing quite a lot of
potatoes. That's why I sound excited. But I'm not actually
excited."</p>

<p>"I told you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know. But it was most interesting. I really didn't get a bit
excited. I'll tell you all about it to-morrow. A lot of them were
<i>really</i> hurt. I'll tell you."</p>

<p>She peered close up to his face.</p>

<p>"There's a sort of cut on that bruise, Monty. A nasty little
cut."</p>

<p>"There was razor blades perhaps in that potato," said Mr.
Abrahams. "They do that sometimes."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; IX</h3>

<p class="first">It was the news of this explosive emergence of Rud
that the old doctor read in his garden. The particulars were not
very accurately given, they had been given by Rud, and the triumph
of Rud had become much more effective and complete in the telling.
And more portentous. In his own admirable phrase he had "clarified
the facts." His experiences in number seventeen were entirely
omitted from the story, because evidently the reporter had learnt
nothing about them. And there was no doubt whatever of the
aggressive intentions of the renascent Popular Socialist Party. It
meant to "modernise and remake the world," no less, "under the rule
of common sense," as interpreted by Rud. "<i>Modern</i> common
sense"; he had apparently said it three times. And first of all
he&mdash;Rud Whitlow if you please&mdash;meant to challenge the
country on the American issue...</p>

<p>"And so exit Bohun," reflected old Doctor Carstail. "I guess
this ends him...</p>

<p>"If half this stuff about him is true, he's
certifiable...Thumbscrews!...Whips!..."</p>

<p>He had been a safety valve. He had put a foolish face in front
of all that snobbish, middle-class riff-raff of his. He had wasted
money that might have worked mischief. He had been a mask, he had
been a gag upon the Fascist drive here. Now it had fairly got
loose...</p>

<p>"This young Whitlow will be different. He's ugly as an octopus
but he's not ridiculous. There's a tenacity about him. And malice.
He reeks, Dick said, of social malice. In these days he may get
almost anywhere. He may get a lot of power. What will he do with
it?...</p>

<p>"That fellow&mdash;I brought him into the world&mdash;and he was
a trouble even then. Twenty-five hours of it she had with him, and
not worth one. (Nowadays I suppose it would be a Csarian&mdash;and
over in an hour. Progress goes on&mdash;even when it's a case of
bringing monsters into the world.) He's a nasty little
creature&mdash;essentially a nasty little creature.</p>

<p>"Intelligent perhaps...</p>

<p>"Some of the stuff he has been telling the interviewers has a
kind of plausibility...</p>

<p>"No doubt our government <i>has</i> been making a mess of this
American business. No doubt this idea of our governing class
getting into touch with some imaginary governing class over there
is all wrong&mdash;and we're getting ourselves up against an angry
real democracy...</p>

<p>"Maybe he has a sort of rightness.</p>

<p>"The last thing one will consent to do is to realise that anyone
else is more intelligent than oneself. Maybe I'm wrong. That little
beast may be more intelligent than I suppose. Like some of those
calculating boys or musical prodigies. A political
quick-thinker..."</p>

<p>He picked up the newspaper and began to read over again the
account of Rud's coup, as the news-hawks had seen it and heard
about if from him. Much about the meeting there was, more about
Rud, and nothing about that meditation in the cellar. Rud had
explained how he himself had thought out that masked caricature as
a means of "bringing Bohun up to the scratch."</p>

<p>"It's indecent! Who ever heard of caricaturing a man on a
political platform in Gladstone's time? Making up to imitate him!
Outrageous. And then the come-back. Fifteen hospital cases. In the
good old days the only people who were carried out of political
meetings were the ones who fainted. Bohun&mdash;kicked in the
groin. Whitlow serious contusions. Almost broken his jaw. I wish
they <i>had</i> broken his jaw. <i>These</i> are political leaders
up to date! Shade of Mr. Gladstone!"</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; X</h3>

<p class="first">"I'm not going to <i>the</i> 'Bell' to-night," Mr.
Whitlow senior announced.</p>

<p>"But, my dear! What will you do at home?"</p>

<p>"There's the radio. And Patience. But at the
'<i>Bell</i>'!...</p>

<p>"The things I get said to me! Unfriendly things. You'd hardly
imagine. It takes away all the pleasure of going out. No
<i>relaxation</i>, it isn't. No <i>distraction</i>. Always harping
on Rud, they are. What's Rud going to do next? Where does Rud get
his money from? <i>I</i> don't know what to tell 'em. He's got into
Politics, I say, and that's the truth of it. As for what he's going
to do about it&mdash;don't ask me. I always said letting him go to
Camford was a mistake."</p>

<p>"I expect he's been <i>led</i> into it," said Mrs. Whitlow.</p>

<p>"Led! I never remember Rud being led by anyone," said Mr.
Whitlow. "It's just his own damned headstrong, ungovernable temper.
I spared the rod on that boy&mdash;all that stuff about repressions
of yours. And here we are!"</p>

<p>"He might have been worse with repressions," said Mrs.
Whitlow.</p>

<p>"And he might not. Is there such a thing in this house as a
couple of packs of cards that Alf hasn't taken two or three out of
for his blasted model-making?...Yes, I said <i>blasted</i>
model-making. B-L-A-R&mdash;No! I mean B-L-A-S-T-I-D model-making.
<i>Now</i> then...Evening paper? No, thank you. I can't take up a
newspaper now not without seeing something about Rud. Why! <i>The
Daily Warning</i> had a photograph of him all tied up like mumps or
something."</p>

<p>"He always did set about things in his own fashion," said Mrs.
Whitlow. "I hope nobody didn't hurt him. He's got a sort of sturdy
look about him, but really he's as delicate as a girl."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XI</h3>

<p class="first">This chapter is trailing as many tail-pieces as a
kite. The end one shall be a lonely, tall figure, not without a
certain sinister dignity, standing at the taffrail of a liner bound
for the Argentine, and watching that brilliant theme with endless
variations, a moonlit wake. Already as they came into warmer
latitudes, dots and thin threads of phosphorescence were becoming
frequent in the black-green water.</p>

<p>"Farewell to England," he said. "Farewell to the political life.
Farewell to proletariat and bourgeoisie. Farewell to the stink and
infinite vulgarity of a mechanised civilisation. And in particular
farewell to the Mockery called Law."</p>

<p>He felt magnificently Byronic.</p>

<p>He quoted:</p>

<p class="poem">"Adieu, adieu! my native shore<br>
Fades o'er the waters blue;<br>
The Night-winds sigh, the breakers roar,<br>
And shrieks the wild sea-mew.<br>
Yon sun that sets upon the sea<br>
We follow in his flight;<br>
Farewell awhile to him and thee,<br>
My native Land&mdash;Good Night!"</p>

<p>He wished he had a better memory for poetry. Then he wouldn't
have to go on repeating this verse, night after night.</p>

<p>He was going back to the great freedom of nature&mdash;in a
general sort of way. Presently Bonina, as weary of that so-called
Civilisation as he was, would break away from the tutelage of her
trustees and come after him. So she had promised him. They would
get some little hundred tonner, they would get together a crew of
congenial souls and sail off westward from Valparaiso, to lead
lives of untrammelled scorn, defiance and impulse in the South
Seas. They would have a great time. They would perhaps buy or
acquire some little sunlit island and become Sun Children. They had
worn the harness of a decadent social life long enough.</p>

<p>Now they would love like tigers, now they would pursue each
other naked about the atoll, slashing at each other wildly and
deliciously with riding whips, or rush through the breakers
rejoicing, and dive and fight sharks with the long thin knives they
would carry between their teeth.</p>

<p>When his leg was better, that is.</p>

<p>And if she didn't change her mind at the last moment...</p>

<p>What were they saying of him in England? (Not that he cared a
dam.) But what were they probably saying? Would there be a
reaction? Would they want him back?...</p>

<p>There <i>was</i> no reaction, no one wanted him back, and so he
vanishes from our story to the throb of a steamer screw, into the
sweet, deep blue of the sub-tropical night.</p>

<h2>I. &mdash; THE ENLARGEMENT OF RUD</h2>

<h3>&sect; I</h3>

<p class="first">Rud's moods in those early days fluctuated widely.
There were those narrow and intense moods of fear and hatred, from
which he never freed himself. There were simply base phases when he
schemed treacherously. There were unruffled moods of lucid
understanding, when everything in life seemed cold and clear and
plain, but these were comparatively rare. Things he had read,
things Bodisham had argued, stray comments of Chiffan's, would
flash together then into a transparent realisation. "Of
<i>course!</i>" he would say to himself. Rare as they were, these
clairvoyant interludes supplied the living material for most of his
political utterances. He knew their value, he listened to himself
then with a detached respect, and he made the fullest use of
them.</p>

<p>Beneath all these again, there were moods, more and more exalted
moods, of pure reverie. They were no longer the objective reveries
of his boyish days, dreams of battle and conquest. Now they were
anticipations of a subtler and more intimate ascendency. They were
concerned now with will power and domination over minds. They were
pervaded by an intensifying self-appreciation. He kept them secret,
as he imagined, from everyone. He would have hesitated to let
anyone suspect how highly he could think of himself. He had a power
over people. He had something peculiarly great in himself. But not
a word about that. He had a feeling that ultimately recognition
must come from some outside source, some one must be bound to
announce his true quality, but until that realisation came from
without, his true quality must remain secret within himself...</p>

<p>In these phases of private exaltation, it seemed to him that his
idea of identifying himself with the Common Man was one of the most
brilliant inspirations that had ever come to mortal intelligence.
It had arisen in his mind with scarcely any premeditation, in the
course of speeches and talking. It had seemed at first the merest
poetry, just a new bright phrasing of the sympathetic element in
the democratic faith. Then he began to realise that it penetrated
to the very core of the human situation, as he beheld it. He was
something greater than the minds about him. He really was greater.
His reveries nowadays were more and more in the fashion of
imaginary critical biography. He projected himself outside of
himself in order to get a better view of himself.</p>

<p>"The Common Man Emergent," that was one of the phrases he found
most acceptable in those opium dreams of his, dreams that he needed
no opium to produce. The Common Man gathered together humanity,
purified it, rendered it. The Common Man Emergent became his
mystical self-divinity.</p>

<p>For the purpose of that imaginary biography he devised a new
background of revolutions, a history leading right up to himself.
He invented an ancient world before the dawn of history in which
the masterful men, the terrifying people, the cruelty dealers, the
punishers, the lords and priests, ruled without challenge, and the
common man knew his master and obeyed the tradition imposed upon
him from the cradle to the grave. To Rud the past had always seemed
horrible. There was no golden age for him. It was, he was
convinced, a cruel world, that early world of barbarism which first
breaks into history. Yet already the Common Man was beginning to
wake up, to protest, to assert himself. Plebeians were rising
against Patricians, democracies against aristocrats. History opened
out for Rud as the Martyrdom of Man, the sacrifice of the Common
Man, in face of a gathering protest on the part of the overpowered
common people.</p>

<p>Christianity, he theorised, had been an outstanding effort of
the common man to find release from repressions, from kings,
emperors and priests, Pharisees and the Law, in a frank
cosmopolitan brotherhood. It was not the only revolt, but in many
ways it was the principal and typical revolt. Its insistence on the
common fatherhood of God, all men equal in his eyes and so forth,
was its fundamental quality. But it had been corrupted early.
Instead of a Rud to express it, a lucid, simple Rud, it had fallen
beneath the sway of&mdash;Saint Paul.</p>

<p>Nobody seemed to love Saint Paul really. Even the theologians.
He was the greatest and least ingratiating of all the makers of
Christianity, the Founder's whipping boy. But Rud's private
blasphemies did not stop at Saint Paul. He dared to think with the
most atrocious boldness of matters that even infidels have hitherto
treated with respect. His private scorn for the "inefficiency" of
the Founder of Christianity for example was fantastic. Here was a
Message, he argued; it was a message of the utmost importance to
all the world, and he chose twelve disciples to record it and
spread it, and <i>not a stenographer among them!</i></p>

<p>Stenographer's a modern idea! Rud would have protested. Not a
bit of it. Cicero was using stenography half a century B.C. So why
wasn't the Sermon on the Mount properly taken down? If it was so
important, why wasn't it taken down? Tell me that, asked Rud, in
the wicked recesses of his heart. He was incapable of realising the
gross incongruity, the indignity, the repulsiveness, of scriptures
based on a shorthand draft.</p>

<p>According to Rud, Christianity was done for, within a century of
its foundation. For want of trustworthy reporting. By that time it
had got itself mixed up with Mithraism, Egyptian Trinitarianism,
blood sacrifices and the Hebrew Promise. It had acquired entangling
dogmas. What a pitiful story of complication and confusion it had
been&mdash;all for the want of a man of Rud's lucidity. A good
start gone wrong. Corruption had been inevitable. Christianity had
found its Marx in Paul and its Stalinites and Trotskyites in the
Gnostics and Arians. A swarm of Bishops and Fathers accumulated all
over it and they suffocated it. It was dead and done for now,
entirely mineralised. Rud tried over phrases in his mind.
"Christianity&mdash;the best of it&mdash;fossilised first-century
Communism. And the rest of it, marine-store junk."</p>

<p>What use was it to us? he asked himself. We were way up in the
twentieth century. All that work had to be done over again. By less
entangled minds...</p>

<p>One might claim to be an early Christian on occasion for
controversial purposes, but that was all...</p>

<p>All that work had to be done over again. And again and over
again until it was really done. There was no other way for
mankind.</p>

<p>For five-and-twenty centuries at least, the Common Man had been
making his frustrated upward thrusts against the power grabbers,
the bullies, the conspirators and masterful people who enslaved and
held him down. All the movements for reformation within
Christendom, all the outbreaks of insurrectionary thought beyond
its borders, Islam for example; the Renaissance, the Reformation,
the great French Revolution; they were all upheavals of human
common-sense against the corruptions and perversions that were
perpetually developing to restrain it and hold it back. So Rud
held. He was, he put it modestly, just one of the billions of
common men held down by these conventions and superstitions. He was
the commonest of common men. The quintessence. So it was he raged
against them. From first to last he was on the side of the rebels.
It was in his essential nature. From his swaddling clothes onward,
the note of protest had sounded in his voice.</p>

<p>He hated all established things. He hated every established
thing, good or bad, and his conception of the Common Man was fast
assuming that same attitude of gigantic defiance against all the
order and dignity of the world which characterised the cartoons of
his Russian avatar, the Marxist Proletarian, hammer and sickle in
hand.</p>

<p>In his private reveries the identification of the Common Man
with Rud was plainly visible. And in the undisclosed depths of that
reverie, his feeling towards every previous exponent of the Common
Man idea was one of embittered rivalry. There was no limit to his
jealousy.</p>

<p>When someone in the Group suggested that the Commonsense
Movement was really Practical Christianity, Rud blew up and
revealed something of what he had hidden away in his mind.</p>

<p>"Augh!" he cried, in querulous protest. "Clean all this past
stuff off history, and begin again. <i>If</i>, after all, we are
only going back to primitive Christianity, whatever it was, the
'simple teaching of Jesus' and all that (only I don't believe we
are for a moment) then let these Christians find it out. We can't
go into all these old disputes of theirs about their blessed
Founder, what he was and what he wasn't, what he did and what he
didn't do, now. They don't know themselves. <i>He had his chance
and lost it.</i> Well, didn't he, Dreed? Very fine chap, no doubt,
but his inefficiency was awful. And the inefficiency of everyone
about him. Think of the march on Jerusalem and compare it with the
march on Rome. Think of wandering about in a Garden until they came
for him...He's smothered up, they've lost him, and it's for them to
find him again. Not us. He's lost under nineteen centuries of
theological deposits. Well, <i>isn't</i> he? <i>Any</i> living
leader is worth a dead one, particularly a dead one who wasn't
properly reported. What's the good of pretending he was? What's the
good of all this smarming over what the Christians have? They
haven't got anything clear and sound. Nothing at all.</p>

<p>"If we've got his stuff as you say, then, <i>if it's the reality
they care for</i> and not just a name, let them fall in with us.
Follow us. Why not? Why should we go after them? Let them sort out
their Jesuses until they've got Mr. Right. But it isn't <i>his</i>
stuff they care for. They never cared for his stuff. They care less
for his stuff than I do. I'm a better Nazarene than any Christian
alive. It's the Name. What's in a name? What <i>is</i> there in a
name? Will human beings never grow out of name magic? Christianity,
if it is all they say it is, by any other name would smell as
sweet. Modern common-sense, that's what we stand for, and let other
people make the identifications...</p>

<p>"Maybe he <i>was</i> the first modern Radical. Maybe, I say. But
that's only historical speculation. Why go back to that? You've got
Christianity plain before you. In the Churches. Look at 'em.
Christianity is as Christianity does...</p>

<p>"Christianity! Look at the Archbishop of Canterbury all dressed
up to kill, cope and mitre and holy rings and all the ancient
spiritual gadgets; look at the Pope in his canonicals. B.C. all of
it, from start to finish. Do you believe any of those fellows are
mentally straight? I don't. Who told them they were entitled to
speak for that Galilean Radical? If they'd lived in his time they'd
have been on the bench with Caiaphas and Pontius Pilate. They think
they can put up their bluff upon the masses, and they aren't afraid
of God looking at them&mdash;for a very good reason. Long ago they
said in their hearts 'There is no God.' That's why they won't have
these things talked about plainly. That's why they insist on
reverence, sacred names and all that. A sacred thing is a protected
thing, a thing in retreat. When you want to argue, they say 'Hush!
Reverence, please. Lower your voices so that nobody can hear the
awful things you are saying. Not so loud, please, and above all,
not so plain.'</p>

<p>"They know they dare not have their stuff stripped down to plain
words. These Bishops and parsons with their beloved Christianity
are like a man who has poisoned his wife and says her body's too
sacred for a post-mortem. Nowadays, by the light we have, any
ecclesiastic <i>must</i> be born blind or an intellectual rascal.
Don't tell me. The world's had this apostolic succession of oily
old humbugs from early Egypt onwards, trying to come it over
people. Antiquity's no excuse. A sham is no better for being six
thousand years stale. Christianity's no more use to us now than the
Pyramids."</p>

<p>So Rud, the Holy Terror, at his most raucous, banging the table,
letting himself go about Christianity, in the councils of the
Group. They heard him with a sort of horrified admiration.</p>

<p>"You can't say outrageous things like
this&mdash;<i>outside</i>," said Bodisham.</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Rud. "But Mussolini and Hitler said almost as
much&mdash;and got away with it. Russia again&mdash;no longer a
Christian country. That thing's not going on for ever. High time it
was wound up. We are making a new world, aren't we?&mdash;and the
old rubbish has to be cleared away. Isn't it absolutely essential
that the old rubbish should be cleared away? Or what is common
sense supposed to be doing?</p>

<p>"Why! Think what happened the other day at Forli! Canopy,
croziers, censers, banners, little boys in lace and petticoats, and
what effect did it have? 'Go home, you old fool,' he said, 'and
change those ridiculous clothes. Get into shorts and do some
exercises.' And the people cheered!"</p>

<p>"Real belief in Christianity," said Chiffan, "may be at an ebb
in the world, Rud, but shockableness is still high. Reverence is
something that survives belief. In these northern countries
particularly. I knew a little boy once whose head was smacked,
smacked soundly by his own mother, for cocking snooks at
Stonehenge. I'm not sure I don't agree with her. So you'd better be
careful."</p>

<p>"I shall be careful," said Rud. "But Forli, mind you, wasn't
shocked...</p>

<p>"The whole world," he said, "is going Radical again.
Fundamentally. In religion. In politics. In law. The Common Man has
been trying to get his Radicalism said and done plainly and clearly
for a hundred and fifty years. Now we take it on. Our movement. The
new wave of attack."</p>

<p>"And fill a ditch in our turn," said Irwell.</p>

<p>"Maybe we're over the last ditch," said Rud. "There <i>must</i>
be a last ditch somewhere...</p>

<p>"All other revolutionary movements have been experiments so far,
Christianity, the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, and
more or less failures. They were experiments in liberation and they
did not liberate. The old things wriggled back. But ours may be the
experiment that succeeds. <i>We</i> may get to the Common-sense
World State. Yes&mdash;<i>we</i>&mdash;in this room...Why not? It
has to come somehow, some when...If it doesn't come pretty soon,
there won't be much of humanity left to liberate."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; II</h3>

<p class="first">It seemed natural to Rud to take the loyal
co-operation of his colleagues in the Group as a matter of course.
He never felt in the slightest degree beholden to them. He took his
leadership over them as confidently as he had taken his bottle from
his nurse in his cradle. They served the Common Man and gave
themselves without stint to the release of this Common-sense World
State from all the foetal wrappings that entangled it. What else
could they do? What else was there to do? So why should the
embodied Common Man thank and flatter them? He snatched their ideas
out of their mouths.</p>

<p>And they chanced to make a team that could co-operate. They kept
together throughout twelve crucial years in human history. He did
little deliberately to hold them together, but his instinct was for
management. His egotistical dominance, his impartial acceptance of
the r&ocirc;le of the representative Common Man, seemed to check the
development of internecine jealousies. During those years
remarkably little force was wasted by the Group in internal
friction. Day by day it grew. Insensibly and yet rapidly it became
a factor, and ultimately a leading factor, in world affairs. Even
when it was already attracting public attention, its members still
seemed for a time mere incidental outsiders adventuring into
politics; commentators rather than combatants. It was by insensible
degrees that they became a revolutionary force of the extremest
efficiency. They did not appear; they grew.</p>

<p>They differed in one essential from the revolutionary groups
from which the earlier dictatorships, the Russian and Italian, for
example, sprang. They had no conspiratorial past whatever, less
even than the Nazis. They were innocent of the underground methods
and free from the tortuous mental habits of the traditional
nineteenth-century revolutionists. And after Bohun's collapse no
trace was left of any of his Fascist or Hitlerian plagiarisms.
Shirts, salutes, symbols, banners, were got rid of. He and his
organisation made just their jumping-off board. They had an auction
of "unsold stock" in aid of the Movement. "Shirts," they
advertised, "can be dyed any colour. Zips not guaranteed." So far
they justified their claim to be a new sort of revolutionary drive
altogether. They developed the opportunity given them by their
picturesque capture of the Purple House and the great fight in the
Canton Hall; with skill and vigour. It was their first introduction
to political realities. They set about their business with immense
seriousness, and they did not only a lot of hard work but a lot of
very hard thinking. They tried over definitions and classifications
and cleared them up; they listed, they documented, they mapped.
They turned the drawing-room floor of number seventeen into a
permanent council-chamber; they vetted and incorporated new-comers;
they were wary of fresh blood but not jealous of it; they were too
desperately anxious to succeed to waste any possible co-operation.
Bodisham's growing conceptions of organisation, Chiffan's flow of
shrewd ideas and Steenhold's ready welcome and support for any
entertaining initiative pervaded the place from the outset, and Rud
went about masterfully, convinced that he organised everything he
learnt and endorsed.</p>

<p>That room still exists for the curious to visit. It is exactly
as they left it when three years later they transferred their
Headquarters to the Sloten Aerodrome. They kept it on, because at
first they thought the Sloten move was a temporary one. The chairs,
the tables, and many of the earlier files and charts are still
there, but over it all now is that faint, faded quality of things
disused. No morning dusting, no sedulous cleaning can avert that
retrocession from reality. All historical showplaces acquire that
progressive incredibility. It seems a little room to have sheltered
so tremendous an initiative. The custodians of the place have added
a collection of photographs of the chief members of the Group
before it moved to Holland. As near as possible they are early
portraits, and each one stands in its frame at the place where the
original was either known or supposed to have sat. (There is no
gavel. Rud always banged with his fist on the table.) There they
talked out the ultimate revolution and laid the foundations for the
Peace of the World.</p>

<p>"Did they think they were playing with their imaginations or did
they realise the tremendous reality of what they were doing?" asks
Lipping. The answer is "Both". Every war, every revolution and
every important invention the world has ever seen, began as a
dream. How else can human enterprises begin?</p>

<p>And they end with the voice of the caretaker, reciting his scrap
of history, showing round the tourist. "That is where He sat, and
generally it seems Chiffan sat to the left of him, rather close to
him to whisper things to him, and there, where the chair is pushed
back, was Steenhold's place. He was the tallest of them all except
Rogers and he used to push his chair back to stretch out his
legs..."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; III</h3>

<p class="first">After the capture of the Purple House, Rud
insisted on a sort of intensive study of this world they were
attacking. His mixture of shrewdness and insight with imaginative
vigour was never more apparent than at this time. Chiffan noted his
increasing elasticity. Always Rud had had mental bounce, but never
so much as this. He would pass at a bound from a private meditation
upon his r&ocirc;le as the Culminating Common Man, to the most intense
practical activity.</p>

<p>"I've got to get into relationship with people now," he
insisted. "With all kinds of influential people. I ought to do it.
We've got to see what they are made of. We've got to get out of our
hole-and-corner stage as soon as possible. Marx was hole-and-corner
all his life, and Lenin had too much of it for his health. We've
got to be different. We've got to escape from narrowness. We're a
movement, not a conspiracy. We've got to radiate contacts, and have
as many people aware of us as possible. That's living, modern
common sense."</p>

<p>In the various personal encounters in which Rud had made himself
known to the worldly powers which might otherwise have impeded the
consolidation of his leadership of the renascent Popular Socialist
Party, his "living, modern common sense" became as flexible and
slippery as an eel.</p>

<p>He saw his loose, large appeal to common humanity spreading and
catching on, and he felt not the slightest scruple in talking
ambiguously and making vague promises to divert and pacify anyone
who might have been disposed to nip him in the bud, restrict his
publicity or rob him of police immunity before he was established
as a world-wide political fact. Sooner or later a struggle was
inevitable, but the later it came, the better for Rud. His instinct
was to get all over the picture first.</p>

<p>In the days immediately following the capture of the Purple
House he saw as many people of importance as he could, mostly they
were people who had hitherto been nothing to him but news and names
and portraits. They wanted to see him now, after that bright
flare-up of publicity, and he wanted to see them, so it was not
very difficult to get together. Opportunities were made for him and
he had to ask for very little. Before the nine-days' wonder of the
great fight in the West End faded out he knew he had to make sure
not only of press but financial support. So he did his utmost to
make sure of both.</p>

<p>It was an enormously educational time for him. He grew years
older in a few weeks. Chiffan watched him in amazement. Political
theorising at Headquarters gave place abroad to practical political
canvassing of the most unscrupulous sort. Bodisham and the others
schemed, made enquiries, prepared dossiers of important people for
him. He went to great pains to make himself "important yet normal"
in the eyes of all these key people.</p>

<p>He built up an effigy of himself for their benefit. Deliberately
and with great self-restraint, he created an impression that was
only effaced in the course of several years. He persuaded or he
showed off or he seemed to betray his quality, as occasion
required. He wanted them to believe he was the man to capture and
sell popular discontent, and they did. After the manner of the
British ruling class, they trusted him as a thoroughly
untrustworthy man.</p>

<p>He let it be assumed that he was bringing no original ideas
whatever into British political life. That, he knew, was
fundamentally important. He discussed the internal situation and
foreign affairs, discreetly and in established phrases. He read
files of <i>The Times</i> for some years back to catch the tone, he
devoured political memoirs, volumes of collected letters and
speeches. He was, he admitted, airing perhaps a few original ideas
in what he had to say, but his heart, he implied, was in the right
place.</p>

<p>He was to be a national invigorator, he conveyed. He was to
profess much, do nothing, and leave everyone the better for it. He
was to take on the task at which Bohun had so signally failed. He
was to put the fermenting new red wine of popular discontent,
popular discomfort and resentment (and popular behaviour in the
Midlands and the North was certainly becoming very serious),
internationalism, collectivism and all those gathering horrors,
back into the brave old bottles of the established order&mdash;in
his own way. But he must have a free hand. He must not be
prevented. Admittedly he was a clever fellow. He conceded that, but
all the same, he intimated, they must not embarrass him. They must
not attempt to tell him. He began in fact where most Labour
politicians leave off.</p>

<p>He let it be tacitly assumed that fundamentally he was a sound,
patriotic Englishman and that, in spite of current difficulties, he
regarded the staggering Empire, the inert monarchy, the Anglican
Church, the Anglican country-house, as the lovely and eternal
framework of the perfect life. Beyond this frame mankind could
progress no further until a thoroughly Anglican Last Day
inaugurated an unending Anglican season in Heaven, with the Holy
Family playing, very tactfully, the part of super-Royalty. Since
they could imagine nothing better, he let it be assumed that he
could imagine nothing better.</p>

<p>He had remarkably little difficulty in establishing the
fundamental respectability of his intentions. He realised with the
profoundest astonishment that a tacit assumption of his Anglicanism
was made for him, that it was incredible to most of these
influential people that a man could be a born Englishman and still
not entertain the completest love and admiration for Anglicanism.
He discovered that even the Jews, Atheists and Roman Catholics of
Britain are fundamentally Anglican. And there was no question of
the entire conformity of the modern Nonconformist. So after all,
considering their immense assimilative power, why should they
question <i>him?</i></p>

<p>No one in the world of influence asked him what he thought about
the established institutions of his native land, and so he told
them no lies. They had no suspicion of the fundamental resentments
in his nature. They didn't perceive that his scowl was an
expression. That he regarded the whole British system as incurably
decayed, a crumbling unteachable system of complex and exasperating
appropriations and resistances, and that it was the dearest
ambition of his black little heart to see it wiped out of existence
as soon as possible and replaced by an Anglo-American synthesis
with a cosmopolitan trend, remained an undisclosed aspect of his
programme. "One thing at a time," said Rud to his council.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said at a lunch party to which he had been
invited by Lady Dragnet, "now that we are one day's journey from
America, we <i>must</i> talk just a little more American than we
did." (That was the stuff to give them.) "Frankly, I think we are
getting badly out of touch with mass opinion over there...</p>

<p>"Yes, but suppose you have made a mistake and put your money on
the wrong horse. Suppose this recrudescence of aggressive Big
Business over there isn't sound. (You know what Americans
<i>are</i>.) Isn't it well to have a strong popular movement in
England in touch with the American Labour side?"</p>

<p>Something in that, they thought.</p>

<p>"I could make just those contacts...</p>

<p>"It has always been part of the strength of England to have a
strong opposition," he explained. "So that when we have got
ourselves into a complete mess&mdash;as I think, if you'll forgive
me, the government is doing now&mdash;we've always had an
opposition formula to fall back upon. That, we can say, is what we
meant all along. That has been our peculiar advantage, a natural,
unpremeditated, providential twofacedness. Sometimes foreigners
have thought us inconsistent&mdash;almost to the point of perfidy.
But it is all perfectly simple. England is like a coin with an
obverse and reverse. <i>Has</i> been, anyhow. A great democratic
monarchy is a contradiction in itself; particularly with a House of
Lords; it <i>must</i> blow hot and cold...</p>

<p>"But nowadays&mdash;Our weakness for the last few years has been
the ineffectiveness of the Opposition. This Labour Party has never
had the quality of a fighting Opposition. It has just sucked the
life out of Radicalism. It has never had the definite idealism of
the Whigs and Liberals. 'Give us more employment and slightly
higher pay and be sure of our contentment,' says Labour. 'We're
loyal. We know our place. But we don't like being unemployed.' What
good is that as Opposition? It's about as much opposition as a
mewing cat. <i>We</i> mean more than that. I tell you frankly. Our
task, I take it, my task, is to reinstate that practical working
Opposition which has always been Old England's alternative line of
defence...For the good of all of us..."</p>

<p>He said that.</p>

<p>He had, he intimated, to put the idea crudely in a conversation.
He might have to put it still more crudely to the country. But they
must understand that he knew what he meant to do. Now and then he
might have to use phrases that would make conservative gentlemen
sit up a bit. More than sit up jump. They had to trust him...</p>

<p>"After all, Joseph Chamberlain was a republican Radical who
talked of 'ransom'; and look at the Chamberlains now!...</p>

<p>"I don't want support in your papers," he told Lord Thunderclap,
the great press peer. "But I want space. Denounce me if you like,
but <i>feature</i> me. I'd rather be denounced. I don't want to
seem to be <i>in</i> with you. I'm being perfectly open with
you."</p>

<p>"And I like openness," said the great Lord Thunderclap, and
regarded him, as far as he could manage it, with the candid face of
a simple, responsible, old-fashioned newspaper proprietor. "I think
we understand one another."</p>

<p>"Anything but silence," said Rud, looking if possible even more
candid than his lordship.</p>

<p>"Run along," said Thunderclap, like a benign God. "You shall
exist."</p>

<p>Thunderclap was particularly impressed by a comparison that Rud,
in developing this theory of British disingenuousness, made of
Britain to a double-headed eagle, looking both east and west.
Thunderclap thought this discovery of the essential duplicity of
England a very penetrating one. In his past he had been accused,
with a certain plausibility, of inconsistency and abrupt changes of
front. But Rud's inferential present of a second head seemed to put
him all square again. He felt Rud was a clever fellow who ought to
be encouraged. He ordered that Rud should be "news" throughout his
press.</p>

<p>"I've got the hang of him," he said. "Nothing Red in
<i>him</i>."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; IV</h3>

<p class="first">Lord Bendigo, another great lord of public opinion
in those days, wasn't by any means as easy as Lord Thunderclap. He
was one of Rud's more difficult problems. Thunderclap thought in
phobias and booms, but Bendigo had ideas of his own. For the most
part they were extremely poor ideas. His leading one had been the
complete isolation of the British Empire from the rest of the
world, which Rud regarded as too obviously silly and impracticable
for serious treatment. He thought at first that Bendigo wasn't in
earnest about this fancy. Then he came to believe that Bendigo was
a man of great obstinacy, fighting down a subconscious realisation
that he had spent a large part of his life promulgating puerile
nonsense.</p>

<p>There was something about this man that Rud found curiously
congenial. He sensed a malignant wilfulness very like his own. This
very resemblance gave Bendigo the quality of an awful warning. "He
has pushed himself into a corner and away from power by the very
vigour of his egotism," Rud reflected. "He thought he could put
over just anything through sheer wilfulness. Things aren't like
that. I used to think it, but I've learnt some lessons. He got his
luck too soon, and that spoilt him. Primary facts are invincible.
You <i>have</i> to respect them. Fact is the mountain you have to
climb, and the way of it is the way you have to go. It's the only
way up. But Bendigo started out to climb a mountain that in fact
wasn't there...And he goes on with all the gestures of his
Isolationist Crusade long after he has realised its futility...</p>

<p>"I, too, have that disposition...I hate going back on myself. I
hate checking up things with other people, but I know enough to
know I've got to do it. He must have just <i>plunged</i> into that
Imperial Isolationism of his. Before he thought over the change of
scale or air war, or any of these newer things. Plunged with a
million readers. And then held on, like a child in a tantrum.
<i>I</i> did that sort of thing when I was a kid."</p>

<p>Criticism of Bendigo was comparatively easy, but how to get a
satisfactory publicity out of him was a riddle. Rud's guess was to
go to him for advice about going into Parliament. "Wait, and I will
tell you," said Bendigo; "it's no time to start now"; and things
were left at that.</p>

<p>Rud tried to convey the effect of a thoroughly dishonest,
pushful and able young man ready to sell and be sold, a young man
in a state of involuntary admiration and natural envy for a
tremendously successful newspaper owner, but even upon these lines
he was doubtful if he got Bendigo.</p>

<p>What on earth did Bendigo want? Of Rud or life or anything?
There was a wicked scrutiny in his lordship's disillusioned eye.
Rud was left with an uneasy memory of that eye. It was an eye that
should have twinkled, and it didn't twinkle. It said for a moment,
with a touch of the genial fellowship of adventurers, "Well, what
are <i>you</i> up to?" and then hardened to "You don't get
<i>me</i>, my boy, whatever you want."</p>

<p>It became the cold, resentful eye of an inordinate man in a
disappointing world. Bendigo had thought life was a lark, he had
handled it inconsiderately and found it a dead lark in his
hands.</p>

<p>Steenhold told Rud there were American parallels. Similar forces
produce similar results. Newspaper proprietors were the most
paradoxical class in the world. Everybody wanted to use newspaper
proprietors, and nobody respected their ambitions. No one expected
them to have ambitions. They were vehicles to take people to all
sorts of desirable destinations&mdash;and wait outside. Never would
the public recognise any possibility of direct leadership in them.
They became resentful, embittered men. All the world over.</p>

<p>In Britain they wore coronets, often slightly askew, but that
made no essential difference. They were at once powerful and
infuriatingly impotent.</p>

<p>Nowhere in the world, Rud reflected, was journalism anything but
a malignant and wanton power. Later on, as the Common-sense
Movement grew, he had to think a lot about that. He had to spread a
new system of ideas throughout the world, and journalism would
neither instruct nor inform nor lend itself consistently to any
sustained propaganda.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; V</h3>

<p class="first">Both these men, Thunderclap and Bendigo, had an
air of really wanting new policies for the country, though they
were essentially crazy policies. They were at least kinetic, they
wanted to make things happen even if they did not quite know what
or how, but the other and really conservative newspaper owners and
directors Rud approached seemed simply holding on to the
established order.</p>

<p>They displayed not simply a disposition to be unbelievably dull
in political matters, they displayed a partisan attitude to
dullness; they even carried on a dullness propaganda; by way of
political education they inundated their readers with the exemplary
memoirs of the empty eminent of the Victorian and Edwardian days.
They still thought that people would thrill at the pomp and
splendour of Lord Grey's mental processes or Lord Oxford's academic
dignity. They ignored every social process afoot and everything
new, unless it was in some way assimilable to the old order.
Nothing, Rud realised, was to be got by a direct association with
them. That meant mere submission. It was clear that to win their
attention something very emphatic and quasi-successful had to be
done.</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Steenhold, "they'd take up our stuff if it came as
news from America, much more readily than if it grew under their
feet. Or from China. It wouldn't seem so disturbing that way. They
still think America and China are oceans away..."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we get a man to write a series of articles warning
people against the dangers of the Common-sense Movement?" said
Chiffan. "We might launch a controversy. Say it was unspiritual or
something of that sort, and drag in the broader-minded bishops to
vindicate us..."</p>

<p>"Is there <i>no</i> press for ideas, as ideas, in England?"
demanded Irwell.</p>

<p>"Only in what they call the silly season," said Chiffan.</p>

<p>Chiffan was inclined to think that the country was in what he
called a "phase of discordance" between its press and its public.
He sprouted an engaging theory that there have to be "periodic
modernisations" in the newspaper world. ("As in everything else,"
said Rud.) Newspapers succeeded, fell into routines and grew
steadily more out of touch with the public mind. They became great
estates. They became pompous and aloof. Until at last the gap
between them and the latent mental possibilities of a new
generation broadened enough to admit a new type of journalism.
This, he declared, had happened to Britain with the onset of the
new popular halfpenny paper at the beginning of the century, and in
America recently with the appearance of the <i>Time</i> type of
national weekly newspaper. And with each of these phases of
modernisation a quickening of the public mind had been made
manifest. The times were ripening now for a fresh move in
England.</p>

<p>Bodisham picked up this idea and, looking ahead, said that if
the movement was to grow it must have an aggressive competitive
press of its own. "We must have a press section of the
movement&mdash;a separate organisation, of course, not a Party
organ. We must try out a paper to <i>pay</i>. We must try a group
of papers...Find men for it. Find men. And keep a Party contact
with them. None of these proprietors for us&mdash;with their
abortive dreams of power&mdash;it's editors and managers we want to
have with us. We've got to re-democratise the press. Dictatorship
is just as bad in a newspaper office as it is in a country. It
stiffens. It mechanises. It devitalises."</p>

<p>When the Group turned its attention to the existing leftward
papers, Chiffan found still more support for his theory that there
were periods of opportunity for publicity, and that now was the
time to vary the production and distribution of newspapers. Rud
listened to all they had to say, and then went off like a drummer
to interest the left press in this new movement he was selling the
world.</p>

<p>And by the time he got talking to them, his bright adaptive mind
had developed Chiffan's theory of stale newspaper forms and methods
into a general theory of collective fatigue.</p>

<p>He addressed various discreet and dubious Liberals: "What I want
to do is to <i>refresh</i> Liberalism."</p>

<p>Liberalism, he said, was practically empty. Why not have it
done-up thoroughly from roof to basement&mdash;repainted? "You want
to be fresh. How can Liberalism be anything but something
fresh?</p>

<p>"The world," he generalised, "is always getting tired of its
ruling phrases. Always. Fresh every morning are the old hopes, but
the words for them have to be different. People want the same
fundamental things age after age, you say; yes, but they want them
in a new dress. We're living in an enslaved and militant world.
<i>You</i> say that and so do I. And why? We're living in a
backward-looking world&mdash;black with debts and old histories.
'We?' you ask. We common men. (Think of me, please, as just one of
your readers come in to tell you off.) We're perplexed and baffled.
We hate the fears and patriotisms that enslave us. Subconsciously
if not consciously. We imagined these patriotisms meant local
freedom, and now we find they mean universal slavery. Patriotism in
a little state is the first resort of a scoundrel. And nowadays all
states are too little. Strangulated. We're crushed to death with
armies and navies and air forces, and nobody wants them to fight.
The common soldiers least of all. We are bored to death of being
ordered about&mdash;and we don't like the new catering. And the
taxes. We're sulking and we want a lead. But where is the chink of
light yet in our prison? Where is <i>your</i> light? Why don't you
go on to something? Everything Liberalism offers the world as an
alternative to drill-ground slavery is either really stale or it
looks stale.</p>

<p>"Why <i>is</i> Liberalism so hopelessly conservative? Worse than
any Tories. Everybody is tired of your League of Nations, for
example, and yet you are still boring away at it. It's no good
arguing whether it's right or wrong or good or bad. It's
<i>stale</i>. It's&mdash;infected. It's infested. It never was
anything more than an insincere gesture. No one believes in it now.
No one at all. It has missed fire with the common man. Alter it at
least, do it up, give it a new name. Wash out the Wilson stuff.
Make it world-rationalist instead of internationalist.</p>

<p>"You keep on boring away at that old, old story. Why? Don't you
really want world unity? Are you really clinging to national
politics subconsciously? Have you asked yourselves that? I misjudge
you? Do I? Well, even as a political fraud the old League is pretty
well played out. What good will it do you or anyone now? Forget
about it.</p>

<p>"That's where your support of the World Common-sense Party would
give you a chance...We <i>have</i> new formulae...</p>

<p>"We English are profoundly tired of our Empire. Indeed we are.
Tired and bored. Don't you realise that? The Empire's become
public-schoolmasters' cant and the boys know all the answers. It's
being stripped and exposed; it's an empire of kraals and slums,
loincloth villages and Bombay sweat-shops; it has never educated,
never released; it has no constructive vitality at all; it's
nothing to be proud of. The intelligent boys are ashamed of it. At
heart Germany and Italy are just as sick of <i>their</i> regimes.
But what can they do? They just go on doing the same old exercises
and repeating the same old catchwords until something comes along
to crystallise their discontent in a positive form. Who can deliver
them from the body of this death? They ask that; everyone asks
that...</p>

<p>"You didn't know of our movement? You don't know anything of any
movement. Your fault, not ours. You just know stale politics...I
can understand Liberalism getting stale. All things get stale. But
why should it want to keep stale?</p>

<p>"The world, I tell you, is bored&mdash;bored now to the
explosive pitch. It's bored by all this incessant war preparation.
It is bored by aimless violence, now here, now there. It is tired
of hatred politics. It's tired of fresh murders every day. It is
not indignant, not excited; it is bored. Bored and baffled...</p>

<p>"I don't believe a man begins to know anything of politics until
he realises the immense menace of mental fatigue, of world-wide
mass boredom. It accumulates. It makes the most frightful
convulsions and demoralisation possible. It makes them at last
inevitable. Nobody wants fundamental changes in a world where hope
and interest prevail. Then people accept their careers, settle down
to them, rear children. But throw them out of work, in and out and
no sense of security, deprive them of bright expectations, regiment
them in masses, underfeed them, bore them with organised mass
patriotism, and they begin to seep together into a common morass of
discontent and impatience. Almost unconsciously...</p>

<p>"They're like that now.</p>

<p>"If you Liberals really <i>had</i> a progressive idea ready for
them now, new-phrased and released from old obligations and old
associations, you could set the world afire with it. If you had.
Eh? Well, <i>we</i> have. We Common-sense men are the real New
Liberalism. Why be so stuffy about it? You've got to bury old
Gladstone sooner or later, just as the Socialists have to bury Karl
Marx...</p>

<p>"After all, what we want is to go on with the Radicalism of the
first French Revolution. We're just revitalised Radicals. That's
what we are. Napoleon was a traitor and the Commune a blunder.
Forget about them. <i>We</i> want <i>real</i> liberty, <i>real</i>
equality, <i>real</i> fraternity...How about 'Back to the Taking of
the Bastille' as a slogan? How about 'The Liberators of the
Bastille'?"</p>

<p>"But I thought you were all for scrapping old traditions," said
the Liberal editor, with an air of making a point.</p>

<p>He had made a point, and Rud had to pull his argument
together.</p>

<p>"Scrapping old corruptions," said Rud. "Radicalism&mdash;the
indignation that stormed the Bastille&mdash;is eternally
young."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VI</h3>

<p class="first">Rud returned to the Group in a state of extreme
mental excitement.</p>

<p>"I've got it," he said, "about the League of Nations. I
understand 1919-20. It's all as clear as daylight."</p>

<p>Chiffan nodded expectantly with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"Yet I never saw it before. These Liberals open one's eyes."</p>

<p>Real affection shone in Chiffan's regard. He was beginning to
feel a genuine parental glow at Rud's impassioned discoveries. If
Rud neither begat nor conceived nor created, he was, at any rate, a
magnificent obstetrician.</p>

<p>"In 1918," said Rud, "the need for such a world unification and
socialisation as we are planning was as manifest as it is now. It
stared the world in the face. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Group waited to see its own revelation plain.</p>

<p>"It meant a fundamental change in nearly every system of human
activities. That is to say, it meant a reconstructed management. It
meant new patterns in politics, world economics, a new world
education, a wider way of living for everyone, and nobody among all
the worthy people to whom the settlement was entrusted could really
stand up to that prospect. Because it meant that they too had to be
renewed. They had to adapt or they had to go. An age of extreme
experimentation was inevitable. It was in the air in 1918. The
rulers and leaders shirked it. Not consciously perhaps but
subconsciously the ruling people resisted every rational step
forward. It was bound to be a vast step, I admit, and into a
strange world. For some of them it was not so much a step as a
precipice. So they decided that the mass of people in the world
were unprepared for it&mdash;while as a matter of fact it was they
themselves who were unprepared for it. See?"</p>

<p>Chiffan's face answered that question.</p>

<p>"Lord, what a pleasure it is to get back to you chaps and talk
freely! I've been diplomatic all day. Now let me splutter...Where
was I? In 1918, I say, the ruling classes everywhere had nightmares
of the Last Trump. Everywhere. They woke up again, clear that
nothing of that sort must happen. The dear old world, which makes
us all we are, must remain. They decided not to resurrect, Last
Trump or no. 'What is this about a readjusted world?' they said.
'Let us have no extravagance. Let us go gradually,' they said, 'let
us go very, very gradually&mdash;in other words, let us do just as
little as possible to alter the rules of the game we have played
hitherto. It is a played-out game, yes&mdash;we admit that <i>in
theory</i>&mdash;but how can any of us learn to play an entirely
new one all at once? If we have to drop the control of things, what
sort of horrid people will replace us? Let us keep our grip and
produce something that will <i>look</i> like a World Peace, a Union
of Mankind, and at the same time let us see that nothing
fundamental is changed about the old Foreign Offices, the old
diplomacy, the old sovereignties, the methods we can work, the
things we know. Business as usual during the resurrection. We won't
attempt to make anything so extravagant as a new world, we will
just make a&mdash;a nice beginning, an unimplemented promise.'</p>

<p>"In that spirit, I tell you, this great Put-off at Geneva was
brought into being. It was a deliberate, almost conscious Put-off.
A crash may come later, said their subconsciousnesses; but, anyhow,
this patch-up of a League will last our time. Germany must pay and
so on, they shall be victims and vanquished according to the best
precedents, but the essence of our settlement is that civilisation
as we know it will be saved."</p>

<p>Rud repeated: "Civilisation as they knew it! They couldn't think
of any other sort of civilisation. Tea when they're called in the
morning, and all that.</p>

<p>"That Geneva generation has been tiding over and putting off the
new world ever since. Growing old and refusing to see how the real
world crisis intensifies with every year of delay. Manifestly to
re-make the world means a vast obliteration of traditions and class
mentalities, but it has to occur. If <i>they</i> won't make over,
it's got to be made over for them. That's where we come in. That
re-making is what <i>they</i> call Chaos, and for them it is
chaos&mdash;the end of
everything&mdash;obliteration&mdash;effacement, anyhow. But for us
it is the revolt of common-sense."</p>

<p>"You don't think there were <i>any</i> honest good intentions in
that League of Nations experiment?" said Irwell.</p>

<p>"How can one plumb the self-deceptions of the muddy-witted?"
said Rud. "There were tons of good intentions. Mountains of good
intentions all round the Lake. They were enough to have made Geneva
stuffy, even if the mountains didn't. These League of Nations
people making believe they were readjusting the world, and
elaborately and carefully doing nothing of the sort, <i>stank</i>
of moral self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>"For all that, the League of Nations was in effect an almost
planned and deliberate abortion of the plain commonsense needs of
mankind, an elaborate sabotage of the Common Man's hopes. To save
trouble. To save face. It was the petition in bankruptcy of the
Liberal mind. This, it said, is all I have. And until the whole of
this generation of damned disingenuous Liberals is dead, what
passes as Liberalism will still be bolstering up this substitute,
this sham, this Make Believe of a New World."</p>

<p>And suddenly he became almost lyric. "For three thousand years
the Common Man has been fended off from the full and glorious life
he might have had, by Make Believe. For three thousand years in one
form or another he has been asking for an unrestricted share in the
universal welfare. He has been asking for a fair dividend from
civilisation. For all that time, and still it goes on, the
advantaged people, the satisfied people, the kings and priests, the
owners and traders, the gentlefolk and the leaders he trusted, have
been cheating him tacitly or deliberately, out of his proper share
and contribution in the common life. Sometimes almost consciously,
sometimes subconsciously, cheating themselves about it as well.
When he called upon God, they said 'We'll take care of your God for
you', and they gave him organised religion. When he calls for
Justice, they say 'Everything decently and in order', and give him
a nice expensive Law Court beyond his means. When he calls for
order and safety too loudly they hit him on the head with a
policeman's truncheon. When he sought knowledge, they told him what
was good for him. And to protect him from the foreigner, so they
said, they got him bombed to hell, trained him to disembowel his
fellow common men with bayonets and learn what love of King and
Country really means.</p>

<p>"All with the best intentions in the world, mind you.</p>

<p>"Most of these people, I tell you, have acted in perfect good
faith. They manage to believe that in sustaining this idiot's
muddle they are doing tremendous things&mdash;stupendous
things&mdash;for the Common Man. They can live lives of quiet pride
and die quite edifyingly in an undernourished, sweated, driven and
frustrated world. Useful public servants! Righteous self-applause!
Read their bloody biographies!</p>

<p>"This League of Nations of the Liberals is only the last of the
endless succession of Make Believes that have baffled the poor,
misinformed, miseducated Common Man. I tell you, stupidity,
self-protective stupidity, is the fundamental sin. No man alive has
a right to contentment. No man alive has a right to mental rest. No
man has any right to be as stupid as educated, Liberal men have
been about that foolish affair at Geneva. Men who have any leisure,
any gifts, any resources, have no right to stifle their consciences
with that degree of imposture. The League of Nations has been an
exposed imposture almost from the start, an impotent substitute for
effort, and it has wasted two decades, twenty crucial years, of
human possibility, the first third of the lives of all of us here
in effect...We who will never have lives again."</p>

<p>Chiffan put his hands on either side of his chin. He reflected
aloud: "This sort of analysis applies, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, to
almost every established institution."</p>

<p>"Essentially, yes."</p>

<p>"Established institutions. You hate them all," said Chiffan.
"Because they stand in our way to a rational, happy, splendid
world."</p>

<p>Chiffan smiled, faintly sceptical. "You just hate them because
they are established institutions."</p>

<p>Rud considered this for a moment and then, with a leap of
frankness: "Yes, Chiffan&mdash;I hate them because they are
established institutions. They confine and stifle me. As they do
you. But they die, they die. Not fast enough, but they die. And the
League of Nations generation is dying, and the dear old scholarly
Liberals are dying, the class of the last great Make Believe are
dying, man by man, day by day. And as that generation, with all its
self-preserving hypocrisies, fades and dies, the stage is
cleared&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Partially cleared," said Chiffan.</p>

<p>"More or less cleared," said Rud. "Cleared perhaps enough."</p>

<p>Chiffan thought of saying something more. He saw something like
an appeal to him in Rud's eye and he said no more. "For us," said
Irwell.</p>

<p>"For the Common-sense of the Common Man," said Rud, with a last
rhetorical flourish, "to come to its own."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VII</h3>

<p class="first">Bold and challenging generalisations went rather
well at the editorial lunch of the leading Liberal paper. These
Liberals felt that so little could ever be done that they were
prepared for any suggestions, however extravagant, for doing
things. They were as receptive of new ideas as baby-farmers are of
babies. They knew they could put away any amount of new ideas and
be none the worse for it, politically or socially. But the Labour
key-men, in conference upon their newspapers, Rud found rather more
difficult to impress.</p>

<p>They were evidently profoundly suspicious of him.</p>

<p>It was his first definite encounter with the wary-eyed,
platitudinous, evasive Labour leaders, and he realised at once the
formidable barrier of inert leadership they constituted, between
the discontented masses and constructive change. They seemed to be
almost entirely preoccupied by internecine intrigues and the
"discipline of the Party". They were steeped in Party
professionalism. They were not in any way traitors to their cause,
or wilfully reactionary, but they had no minds for a renascent
world. They meant nothing, but they did not know they meant
nothing. They regarded Rud just as in their time they had regarded
Liberalism, Fabianism, Communism, Science, suspecting them all,
learning nothing from them, blankly resistant. They did not want
ideas in politics. They just wanted to be the official
representatives of organised labour and make what they could by it.
Their manner betrayed their invincible resolution, as strong as an
animal instinct, to play politics according to the rules, to
manoeuvre for positions, to dig themselves into positions&mdash;and
squat...</p>

<p>"<i>I'll</i> get a move on them," said Rud.</p>

<p>"They've got the Trade Unions behind them."</p>

<p>"I've no use for Trade Unions. They've lasted long enough.
They've locked up the workmen in a sort of small-tradesman
respectability. We want more than that nowadays. They've hampered
the natural political and social emergence of the common man."</p>

<p>"Trade Unions to go!" said Bodisham. "Christianity to go! You're
making us take on a lot, Rud. You're a bit of a Terror, Rud."</p>

<p>"You know I'm right. They've gone in Russia, Germany, Italy.
They totter in America and France. This country has got to move
with the times. We've got to take a lesson from the passion of
China, we English and Americans, and wake up before it is too late.
I won't be premature about this. Trust me to know when to open fire
and how."</p>

<p>"The queer thing is that we <i>do</i> trust you," said Bodisham.
"In spite of your&mdash;extremism."</p>

<p>"You'd better," said Rud with grim conviction. "<i>I'm
right</i>. What is extremism? The whole truth and nothing but the
truth. I ask you."</p>

<p>"It's because of his extremism you trust him," said Chiffan.
"It's because in the last resort we believe in his indiscretion,
and know he won't fail us even if we fail ourselves. All leadership
is extravagance. Extra-vagance. Going a bit ahead."</p>

<p>Rud did not quite understand that. "It's because you know I'm
right," he said.</p>

<p>"It's because," said Chiffan, letting his thoughts run away with
him, "to make a new world, the leader must be a fundamentally
destructive man, a recklessly destructive man. He breaks his way
through the jungle and we follow...We cannot do without you,
Rud."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VIII</h3>

<p class="first">Irwell did his best to inform Rud about the City,
and get the reactions of his fine inexperience to that complex
system of activities. More and more was the Group finding something
oracular and decisive in his penetrating detestations. "Of course,"
they said now to his most startling dogmatisms. "Of course."</p>

<p>Rud and Irwell had lunch with an enquiring group of
stockbrockers; and on another occasion, they were privileged to
have their views about social credit put right for them by a
friendly banking firm which lunched over its offices in a large,
graceful room, with such an unpretending splendour of silver and
mahogany and cold sideboard, and so protected from outside clamour
by double windows and carpeted floors, that it seemed to Rud for a
time that he must have fallen into some older, wiser and altogether
more stable and comfortable world.</p>

<p>But Rud talked none the less effectively on that account. He
talked in particular here of his doctrine of the abolition of the
Atlantic. America and Britain, with only ten hours to separate
them, were becoming one again. There must be some sort of practical
coalescence ahead. Must be. But, lunching over a bank, he did not
make it as clear as he might have done whether he meant a
coalescence of the United States and Britain or a coalescence of
the City and Wall Street. "Business," he threw out, "is more
plastic than political structure. There will certainly be an
Anglo-American newspaper coalescence, for example, in the next ten
years."</p>

<p>"It has been tried several times."</p>

<p>"And it will be tried again and again&mdash;until it
succeeds."</p>

<p>"We're an old firm," said the senior partner.</p>

<p>"But a live one," said Rud.</p>

<p>"If I knew anything of newspaper finance," he added, "I'd try to
get ahead with a straddle paper now."</p>

<p>But no one responded to that feeler.</p>

<p>"There's a remarkable feeling of solidarity between the Labour
Movement here and those South Carolina strikers&mdash;in the rank
and file especially. The news gets across, I hardly know how. It's
something new. You've never had cotton and steel workers swapping
experience and news before&mdash;Pittsburg talking to our Black
Country. They do now. They know now what the others wear and how
they eat and the games they play. If Finance doesn't start a
Transatlantic coalescence, Labour certainly will. The young men, I
mean..."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and left it at that. He turned to the
topic of Social Credit and the increasing interest of the general
public in the social effects of finance. "Finance has never been in
general politics here yet," he said, "but public attention is
growing. The number of small investors increases here. Presently
they are going to start asking questions. In America they're ahead
of us in that. But we're coming up. The common man over there has
been puzzling his brains about currency and credit ever since the
days of William Jennings Bryan...It's a tempting field for
political adventurers just now."</p>

<p>The junior partner raised his eyebrows slightly and glanced at
Rud.</p>

<p>At the time Rud had little more to say.</p>

<p>He had however quite a lot more to say when he reported his talk
to his counsellors at the Purple House.</p>

<p>"That City of yours is a morbid excrescence. Wall Street is a
morbid excrescence. Plainly it's a thing that has grown out upon
the social body rather like&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;an
embolism, thrombosis, something of that sort. A sort of heart in
the wrong place, isn't it? Anyhow&mdash;there it is. Everything
seems obliged to go through it now; it can hold up things,
stimulate things, give the world fever or pain, and yet all the
same&mdash;is it necessary, Irwell? Is it inevitable? Couldn't we
function economically quite as well without it? Has the world got
to carry that kind of thing for ever?</p>

<p>"What real strength is there in a secondary system of that sort?
It's secondary, it's parasitic. It's only a sort of hypertrophied,
uncontrolled counting-house which has become dominant by falsifying
the entries and intercepting payment. It's a growth that eats us up
and rots everything like cancer. Financiers make nothing, they are
not a productive department. They control nothing. They might do
so, but they don't. They don't even control Westminster and
Washington. They just watch things in order to make speculative
anticipations. They've got minds that lie in wait like spiders,
until the fly flies wrong. Then comes the debt entanglement.
<i>Which you can break</i>, like the cobweb it is, if only you
insist on playing the wasp. I ask you again what real strength has
Finance if you tackle Finance? You can tax it, regulate its
operations, print money over it without limit, cancel its claims.
You can make moratoriums and jubilees. The little chaps will dodge
and cheat and run about, but they won't fight. It is an artificial
system upheld by the law and those who make the laws. It's an
aristocracy of pickpocket area-sneaks. The Money Power isn't a
Power. It's respectable as long as you respect it, and not a moment
longer. If it struggles you can strangle it if you have the
grip...You and I worked that out long ago, Chiffan...</p>

<p>"When we're through with our revolution, there will be no money
in the world but <i>pay</i>. Obviously. We'll pay the young to
learn, the grown-ups to function, everybody for holidays, and the
old to make remarks, and we'll have a deuce of a lot to pay them
with. We'll own every <i>real</i> thing; we, the common men. We'll
have the whole of the human output in the market. Earn what you
will and buy what you like, we'll say, but don't try to use money
to get power over your fellow-creatures. No squeeze. The better the
economic machine, the less finance it will need. Profit and
interest are nasty ideas, artificial ideas, perversions, all mixed
up with betting and playing games for money. We'll clean all that
up..."</p>

<p>"It's been going on a long time," said Irwell.</p>

<p>"All the more reason for a change," said Rud.</p>

<p>"I suppose the first gamblers were those caravan Semites who
played a sort of chequers in the sand for their camels with dung,"
reflected Irwell. "They would gamble away everything they
possessed. They would gamble with themselves and become
slaves."</p>

<p>"Don't you be hard on the Semites," said Rud. "The Cretans
traded pots and pans&mdash;for profit."</p>

<p>"The Azilians, way back in the Mesolithic, had pebbles marked
for some game," said Irwell, unfolding his knowledge.</p>

<p>"It doesn't follow that a nasty habit of mind is any less nasty
because it's ancestral. It doesn't follow you can't cure it. Why
scratch fleas for ever? Gambling, speculation, is a social disease.
It's as natural and desirable as&mdash;syphilis..."</p>

<p>"Well, we're curing syphilis by telling people about it...</p>

<p>"The City and Wall Street can go back to where these games of
property-snatching and stealing began. They can play craps for
their buttons. It's high time the world stopped being a gaming
saloon with the common man's needs and comfort in the kitty. High
time...As soon as the common man hears <i>us</i> asking for that,
<i>he'll</i> ask too."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; IX</h3>

<p class="first">Chiffan cleaned up another neglected facet of
Rud's education by taking him to the Houses of Parliament, sitting
with him in the Strangers' Gallery for a time and introducing him
to a friend or two, for whom he had done trifling journalistic
services in the past. One or two members who had heard already of
the Common-sense Movement in their constituencies were only too
willing to be friendly with this ugly, white-faced, erratic talker.
Rud was given tea on the terrace and inspected and drawn out.</p>

<p>He surveyed this celebrated Terrace. Narrow, it was, he noted,
at the foot of a cliff of sham Gothic stonework, barely a century
old and already badly corroded. "Thoroughly Anglican," he thought.
Chiffan's friend collected a small group for him, that came and
went restlessly.</p>

<p>These politicians impressed him as being the most shortsighted
and sceptical men he had ever met. They lived in a little world
that was bounded on the one side by "office" and on the other by
the constituencies, and they seemed unable to imagine that it was
not an eternal world. One tall man, he observed, in the year of
grace 1941 was wearing a long frock-coat and a peculiar half-stiff
collar reminiscent of that great parliamentary hand, Mr. Gladstone.
They talked with one another about divisions; the government
majority had dropped to twenty; and they talked about a scene in
the House. The P.M.'s manners were becoming intolerable. Then with
an air of relaxation they turned to Rud. The possibility of
altering opinions in the constituencies seemed a very theoretical
one to them. No doubt there were these waves of opinion in the
country, and an intelligent parliamentary politician observed them
and dodged about among them, but it was quite outside their
technique to consider how the pressures of opinion could accumulate
and be directed.</p>

<p>Rud thought they might be impressed by the breadth of his
outlook. He tried to pose as the earnest young enquirer, wanting to
know. He thrust out feelers. Where <i>is</i> power in the country?
Where is responsibility? In this country? In any country?</p>

<p>But the elusive mystery of political power is no proper subject
for the terrace at tea-time. There is nothing to be known about it
and everybody knows all about it. So what is there to discuss?</p>

<p>He tried over a suggestion of Chiffan's that Power is always
being drawn together into a centre, and then escaping again and
diffusing itself. He had not thought much of that at the time, but
now that he heard himself say it, it seemed quite a good idea.
There were, he argued, widespread accumulative phases in
politico-social life, and these were always followed by executive
phases, a sort of diastole and systole, a diastole of accumulation
and a systole of concentrated impulse against diffused systematic
resistances. He tried to impress them with the idea that a phase of
diastole was coming to an end, and that the apparent apathy of the
day might turn at any moment to the rush of the oncoming systole.
But they were manifestly not interested. He might as well have
talked to a team of cricketers of possible earthquakes, grass
impoverishment and a coming shortage or excess of rain. They
returned to the topic of the Prime Minister's lamentable
temper.</p>

<p>He came away with an exasperated sense of failure. He denounced
parliamentary government root and branch that night. Parliament was
doomed. The fact that it had not listened to Rud was only one
little conclusive fact in a long indictment. "It has become a
series of empty forms," he said. "All over the world, always, the
sawdust of reality is running out of the shapes of quasi-public
things. Not one British citizen in a thousand watches what is done
in Parliament; not one in a thousand Americans follows the
discourses of Congress. Interest has gone. Every election in the
past thirty years has been fought on gross misunderstandings."</p>

<p>Bodisham ticked off the points of the new Common-sense Movement
on his fingers. "The City is rotten and Parliament is rotten."</p>

<p>"But they are!" said Rud.</p>

<p>"Christianity is rotten and Labour politically is rotten."</p>

<p>"But aren't they?"</p>

<p>"The curious thing is that we believe in you, Rud."</p>

<p>"We have much to destroy," said Dreed.</p>

<p>"We have nothing to destroy," said Rud. "All these things are
done for already. They are falling in all over the world. They are
dead. No need for destructive activities. But if we have nothing to
destroy we have much to clear away. That's different. What
<i>is</i> needed is a brand-new commonsense reorganisation of the
world's affairs, and that's what we have to give them. I can't
imagine how the government sleeps of nights. <i>I</i> should lie
awake at night listening all the time for the trickle of plaster
that comes before a smash. Ever since they began blundering in the
Near East and Spain, they've never done a single wise thing. This
American adventure spells disaster. Plainly. Australia has
protested already. India now is plainly in collapse. Everyone who
has been there lately with open eyes speaks of the vague miasma of
hatred in the streets. We don't get half the news from India. Just
because there exists no clear idea whatever of a new India, it
doesn't mean that the old isn't disintegrating. Things that are
tumbling down, tumble down. They don't wait to be shown the plans
of the new building. The East crumbles. All over the world it
becomes unpleasant to be a foreigner, but an Englishman now can't
walk in a bazaar without a policeman behind him..."</p>

<p>The little council hammered out these intuitions and dogmatisms
of Rud's eagerly and helpfully. They showed themselves more and
more impressed by the soundness of his idea of attracting attention
in Britain by specialising conspicuously in a new American liaison
and starting from the outset with an Atlantic straddle...The time
for it, they agreed, was now.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; X</h3>

<p class="first">"America," said Steenhold. "Certainly America.
Right away. You come with me to America and we'll run round a bit.
We can manage a fortnight there. Start Friday, New York Saturday.
Partly we'll bus about the country and partly we'll get special
planes. I've got it all figured out. There's one or two lads I'd
like you to see, and a few bunches I'd like to hear you talk to.
There's things brewing there.</p>

<p>"You can talk to the news-hawks. We'll give you a press...Tell
'em all how you did in Bohun; he's just the sort of thing Americans
detest...</p>

<p>"I shall love to show you America.</p>

<p>"All you lousy Europeans underrate America. It under-rates
itself. We've been shaping history for a century. Ironclads we
invented. We opened up Japan, but you British played us crooked on
that. You've always been crooked on Japan and China with us. But
never mind that now. We started flying&mdash;and we started the
popular motor-car. And who invented the machine-gun? Who started
big business and mass production? What would have happened to
Soviet Russia if it hadn't had American notions? If it hadn't had
Americanised Russians to start it? Soviet Russia nearly got away
with things, simply thanks to America."</p>

<p>"The British Museum Reading Room had a hand in that," said Rud.
"Marx read there, Lenin read there. Litvinov."</p>

<p>"That old gas reservoir! Trotsky was American-trained. And do
you know what was the matter with Stalin? He knew nothing real
about America...What's the trouble with Russia now? It's lost its
American kick. It's ceasing to ventilate. It's going back to Asia.
Still I don't want to humiliate you Britishers too much. There's a
sort of tenderness&mdash;in every American. But there they are, the
Russians, de-Americanised and consequently stuck.</p>

<p>"What they want in Moscow," said Steenhold, expanding his theme,
"is derision, healthy derision. At first under Lenin, I'm told,
there was some."</p>

<p>"Where there is no derision the people perish," said
Chiffan.</p>

<p>"Now who said <i>that?</i>" asked Steenhold, always anxious to
check his quotations. "It sounds familiar."</p>

<p>"I said it," said Chiffan. "Get on with your suggestions."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XI</h3>

<p class="first">Rud had never been in a plane before. He felt a
boyish excitement in seeing the familiar map of south-west England
spread out below him in the twilight; he watched the lightships and
lighthouses flashing into being, and he soared up, up past a few
cloud whiffs, and up and up, into a softly throbbing starlight. He
glimpsed the retreating sunset and then lost it again. The sun has
gone ahead, he thought, and presently it will be round again and
overtaking us, but some day the common man will beat the sun. In
which case somehow wouldn't he always be picking up his
yesterdays?</p>

<p>That line of thought was too mathematical for Rud's rhetorical
mind, and he dropped it. He lay back dreaming and presently a deep
blue daybreak came to swallow up the stars.</p>

<p>The plane came down into the lower air. New York, that city of
ten thousand bristling towers, facing the sunrise, still with the
sleep in its ten million office windows, was a memorable picture.
As they droned softly over the Hudson river, the reawakening
clangour of that mighty aggregation penetrated the suddenly subdued
hum of the engines.</p>

<p>The press had come to the airport for them, eager for a
first-hand story of the Purple House. Steenhold had seen to that.
They seemed to be more excited than the British press about Bohun.
"He's the sort of thing we have to clear away, before England and
America can talk together," said Rud, concluding some pithy
comments on his defeated adversary.</p>

<p>"What have <i>you</i> come to tell us, Mr. Whitlow?"</p>

<p>"Rud&mdash;if you please&mdash;Rud Whitlow. I've come to
learn."</p>

<p>"Anything in particular?"</p>

<p>"I want to know who's responsible for keeping the common man in
England and the common man in America out of step."</p>

<p>"Most of us would say it's your government. Especially now."</p>

<p>"I think so too. But there's more in it than that. That's what I
want to find out."</p>

<p>"Are you going to talk on the Radio?"</p>

<p>"Ask me. I'll talk."</p>

<p>"Do you talk on the Radio in England?"</p>

<p>"Never. We've got a government-controlled Radio over there now,
and they tighten it up and tighten it up, for fear of ideas getting
loose. The Anglican Empire has taken to sitting on the safety-valve
of free speech; it's been heading back to Dreamland ever since the
Abdication. So much the worse when the burst comes. The Bishops and
the Court people and the Foreign Office and the Old Gentry and Bath
and Cheltenham and Blimpland and all that, are more and more afraid
of our common men getting ideas. New ideas. Very afraid. They've
done so well by the old set. You know they censor all your American
papers? The more they're blacked out, the more we like you.
Backwardness is their pride and glory. The Churchmen have stifled
our schools and universities for a century. The House of Lords is
the sterilisation chamber for newspaper owners and publishers.
England's become the great Hush Hush land of the world. Not a land
of cruel repression but a land of Hush, Hush. Don't say a word or
else you'll wake the babies. Politically the British common folk
are the most ignorant and backward people in the world. But maybe
now I am over here I'll talk a bit to England on the air."</p>

<p>"The Great Hush Hush Land" made a good headline start for
Rud.</p>

<p>The idea of an English common man coming to America to speak his
mind to England, was fresh enough in itself to get him a press.
"We've never heard of this English common man of yours before,"
said one reporter.</p>

<p>"You have. What else do you think kept our nobility and gentry
from messing up your Civil War?"</p>

<p>"That's true, I suppose," said the news-man.</p>

<p>"And much thanks we common Englishmen get in <i>your</i>
histories," said Rud.</p>

<p>Some of the Tory press tried to guy Rud. They said he had an
Oxford accent and conversely that he rearranged his aspirates. They
telephoned to London for facts against him, but they could get
hardly any facts for or against him. They tried to find out if he
had a "love life". They could not find so much as a blonde hair
upon him. They said he was a political monomaniac, but that did not
hurt him. They picked the worst photographs of him and issued
caricatures. But though they made him grotesque, that did not make
him in the least feeble or repulsive. The more liberal papers took
him up from a different angle as the New Type Briton. The press
fought about him and the Radio people found he had a natural
aptitude for "talks", always with something new to say and always
in effect reiterating his self-assertion.</p>

<p>"Our common people have been kept apart by politicians and bad
history, long enough. We ought to have scrapped old George the
Third when you did. That's kept us out of step ever since. Sorry to
be so behind you; but how about getting together now? Our common
tongue. Our common freedom. Our common future. While there is still
time. Then we'll get these soldiers off our backs, and start fair.
That's what I'm here for. That's what I want to learn about."</p>

<p>"Your Party is the Popular Socialist Party, isn't it,
still?"</p>

<p>"We're dropping that name out of respect to his lost lordship.
We fired him. We're calling ourselves the Party of the Common
Man."</p>

<p>"In England?"</p>

<p>"Throughout the world."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XII</h3>

<p class="first">That American campaign outran Steenhold's wildest
hopes. Rud was intensely excited and met his every occasion with an
inspired aptness. He conferred. He addressed meetings. He talked on
the air. He dictated interviews. His energy seemed inexhaustible.
Always he seemed to be saying something fresh and always he seemed
to be saying something obvious. "You <i>disentangle</i> things,"
said Steenhold, trying to give it a name.</p>

<p>In a dozen cities ambitious young men were presently starting
nuclei for the Party of the Common Man.</p>

<p>Rud surveyed America from east to west and from north to south
from the air. His first impression was an amazing spaciousness.
Everywhere there was space. Too much desert there was, too much
wilderness; the empty undefended coasts of the west frightened him,
the vast unkempt rivers. When later he flew from London to Moscow
and thence by way of Constantinople and Rome home, Europe in
comparison, with its strips and roads and disciplined waterways,
looked like one continuous land of gardens. But everywhere where he
descended in America he found communities living in fine great
cities, speaking the same language, using the same idiom of
thought, and prepared to understand him completely. And he took the
utmost care that his great idea was understood.</p>

<p>He kept his end up against Steenhold with difficulty in a long
and tedious comparison of these two sections of the
English-speaking world. He and Steenhold had absolutely the same
ideas and the same vision of things, and yet so subtle is the virus
of patriotism that these two professional anti-patriots made
international comparisons until they argued themselves into a rage.
Steenhold was the more aggressive of the two; he was never happy
until he had roused Rud to retort. And Rud, in spite of himself,
was forced to be partisan and counter-offensive.</p>

<p>"You English," said Steenhold.</p>

<p>"You Americans," said Rud.</p>

<p>"When you aren't as fresh as paint," he said, "you Americans are
as stale as old cabbage leaves. I'm amazed at your Labour leaders,
at the sort of things you can still take seriously as Presidential
Candidates. These leonine reverberators tossing their manes back in
order to keep their eyes on the White House&mdash;they belong to
the Pleistocene. We dropped that sort of head in England after John
Bright. When the Revolution is over and I retire, I shall retire as
Hitler did, to some remote hunting-lodge, and we'll have the heads
of Great Labour Leaders and Presidential Hopes stuck all round the
Hall. Hippopotami won't be in it."</p>

<p>Rud's picture of the world, under the stimulus of this
experience, expanded and became factual with terrific rapidity. He
felt that his Anglo-American idea had been mere talk before, even
to himself; that hitherto he had never believed in its feasibility;
but now it was becoming immensely credible. "The pivot of our
movement has to be in America. The bulk of our Party has to be on
this side and"&mdash;he paused and looked at Steenhold&mdash;"I
haven't to come to America more often than <i>once</i> a year. For
one short week."</p>

<p>"I don't quite see," began Steenhold.</p>

<p>"Public men in America are <i>too</i> public. Too accessible.
This sitting on the stoop and being 'just folk' was all very well
for local politics and the simple farmer days of a hundred years
ago, but it's no good for world affairs. Opening flower-shows and
being genial to babies and all that is out of date. These parish
politics methods have to go. The ultimate leader ought to be
distant, audible but far off. Show yourself and then vanish into a
cloud. Marx would never have counted for one tenth of his weight as
'Charlie Marx' playing chess with the boys, and Woodrow Wilson
threw away all his magic as far as Europe was concerned when he
crossed the Atlantic. Before he crossed he was a
god&mdash;<i>what</i> a god he was! After he arrived he was just a
grinning guest. I've got to be <i>the</i> Common Man, yes, but not
common like that."</p>

<p>"It's a new thing for America&mdash;an invisible Great Man,"
said Steenhold, considering it, "but I believe you're right."</p>

<p>"I'm right," said Rud, and then with a certain bitterness:
"<i>Look</i> at me. It would be money in my pocket if I were
invisible altogether."</p>

<p>Steenhold considered his leader's visage judicially.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "You've got to be careful with it, of course, and
you don't want to make it too cheap. I admit a snapshot might make
a mess of you. But you've got <i>force</i> about you. They never
laugh at you on the platform. Not a titter. They gape until you
begin, wondering what that scowl's about, and then your voice gets
them. But you're dead right about not overdoing it with the cinema
and the mike. Aloof's the word. No pomp&mdash;but aloof."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XIII</h3>

<p class="first">While Rud was making this American trip Bodisham's
conceptions of organisation were being greatly elaborated and
defined. For a while his influence made Rud the passionate advocate
of thinking things out&mdash;even at the price of delay. An obscure
instinct for timing may have contributed to that.</p>

<p>Bodisham insisted upon a series of conferences with practically
all the Group present and participating. The egg of the world
revolution was indeed incubated in meetings very like tutorial
classes. Our dramatic and romantic dispositions would have it
otherwise, but that was the course reality chose to take. It was
begotten of a sentence, it was fostered in talk. In the beginning
was the Word. There is no strong, silent man in the history of the
world renascence.</p>

<p>"I've got so little to say," said Dreed, and he was the nearest
approach to speechlessness in the Group.</p>

<p>"All the more reason for coming to listen," said Rud.</p>

<p>They had to understand each other, Bodisham urged, and to keep
on understanding each other. "You have to <i>talk</i> a movement
into being," he said, "and you have to keep it alert by talk. You
have to write and keep on writing memoranda on the different
expressions of our fundamental ideas, as fact challenges them. It
is laborious but absolutely necessary."</p>

<p>So long as Lenin lived, Bodisham argued, he wrote and talked and
explained, and when he died progress in Russia turned its face to
the wall. The hope went out of the Russian experiment. "You have to
play the r&ocirc;le of Lenin in our movement," said Bodisham. The
Common-sense Party had to keep alive mentally even if it risked
serious internal conflicts. Rigidity was a sign of death. Fixed
creeds were the coffins of belief.</p>

<p>Rud assimilated Bodisham and rendered him with a vigour Bodisham
could never have shown.</p>

<p>"We've got to bring more men into this, and perhaps a different
sort of man, and we've got to scrap any delusion that we're going
to make tools of them. Those damned Bolsheviks were always playing
obscure games, with each other as pieces, until Stalin swept all
the others into the discard. Choked by their own self-conceit.
We've got to avoid that sort of thing. This idea of <i>using</i>
other people and <i>capturing</i> other people, is an idiot's
dream. We aren't that superior. We've got to find certain necessary
supplementary men. What do we know of the air, any of us here? What
do we know of transport? What do we know of handling troops? We've
got to find men for all that, sympathetic, different men. We've
even got to bring them into this council; their new blood, their
new ideas, their new point of view; and we've got to assimilate
them. And assimilate ourselves. '<i>Assimilate</i>', that's the
word. But <i>mutual</i> assimilation. When we've got a common
philosophy and a common objective; then we can advance in open
order. We shall be a great team. But we've got to make sure of that
common set of ideas. Maybe we shall find our formulae difficult for
some of these new types. If we keep our minds open, we may find
that they are right and that our formulae have to be modified.
Probably&mdash;it's a thought that shouldn't dishearten
us&mdash;but probably we don't know everything."</p>

<p>To which Bodisham nodded approval, adjusted his glasses and
tried not to look like a teacher hearing a recitation.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XIV</h3>

<p class="first">An idea upon which Rud laid great stress in these
pregnant days was what he called <i>parallel independent
co-operation</i>. It was doubtful whether he himself originated the
phrase or Bodisham. Probably neither of them could have answered
that question with precision. But even if it was not originally
Rud's, he made it his.</p>

<p>A world revolution, he insisted, must advance on a wide front.
You could no more standardise the men in a world revolutionary
movement than you could make all the parts of a machine alike.
Every factor had its own set of functions, and all conscious
functions necessitate their own distinctive mentality. The
newspaper man had one set of behaviour patterns, and the man in the
physical power organisation, soldier or policeman or what not, had
another. Research and direction needed a third set; and so on. One
big mistake of the Communist movement had been the attempt to
stereotype the Party member. What was a natural expression for a
transport man, say, became mere cant if you forced it on an
agricultural worker. The idea of some sort of central omniscience
was the fallacy of autocracy. "Don't think of centralisation; think
of balance."</p>

<p>"But you must have a centralising body, a nuclear fact, the
touchstone, the ultimate reference, the quintessence of the idea,"
said Rogers.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> am the quintessence of the idea," said Rud. "<i>I</i>
am the uncomplicated, uncovenanted, unrestricted common man. Stalin
thought he was, but I <i>know</i> I am. I am the sufficient
sample."</p>

<p>"For the time being," said Chiffan softly.</p>

<p>"For the time being," said Rud, without extreme conviction and
after a moment's pause.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XV</h3>

<p class="first">Bodisham's organisation charts were destined to
become historical museum exhibits of the utmost importance. They
have been reproduced in the exactest facsimile a score of times.
Nearly every History of the World Revolution displays the "central"
one as a frontispiece. He worked at them in that small
drawing-office, still preserved intact for all the world to visit,
in number sixteen. He worked at them with a number of coloured inks
and a sublime unconsciousness of the immense possibilities of his
scheming. The ink he spilt is still on the faded carpet; the wall
is pock-marked by his drawing-pins. Occasionally he smudged his
work or used an ink-eraser until he nearly perforated the paper.
Chiffan came and made suggestions almost daily. He was more than a
little jealous of Bodisham, but he had the generosity to respect
his quality and admit his own limitations. His own intelligence
worked in brilliant flashes, but Bodisham's went on, a steadfastly
burning flame, indefatigable. Rud came to survey the developments,
making sometimes a pithy comment, and sometimes merely standing in
meditation before the great scheme.</p>

<p>The charts showed plainly the developing conception of the world
revolution as it grew in the minds of its makers. Bodisham would
sit over his big sheets of paper, compasses in hand, breathing
audibly, thinking through long pauses, then flinging himself upon
some freshly apprehended linkage, scribbling, blotting, tearing the
chart from its drawing-pins, shouting for his assistant to carry it
away and recopy it&mdash;for the fortieth or fiftieth time. The
whole diagram was enclosed in a huge circle, and in this clustered
minor circles, which touched, overlapped, were joined by coloured
bands and lines, signalled to each other with arrows, displayed
significant tinting. These things meant association of leaders and
direction, partial merger of activities, mutual information and so
forth.</p>

<p>The all-comprising outer circle represented what Rud called the
Idea of Common-sense, the idea that a general agreement about life
among normal men, based on mutual respect, is possible, and that
this common agreement could be made the one supreme criterion of
law and collective activity. Sweep away authoritarian ideas,
delusions of superiority and inferiority and a general complex of
subconscious dishonesties, and that was what you exposed. That was
the true Social Contract.</p>

<p>The Party in its more generalised form was little more than a
loosely organised propaganda for the intensive reiteration of this
one common-sense idea, the idea that the world as a whole belongs
to every human being. The only justification for interference with
the free dominion of the individual was the common good. No claim
of authority or of debt was valid beyond that controlling
consideration. This was a fundamental concept of the movement, and
it meant a continuous attack on everything that set up preferential
distinctions and divisions among mankind, that is to say racial,
national, religious, sexual claims and assertions, and every sort
of artificial advantage and privilege, all hereditary
appropriations, inherited wealth or other priorities. It boldly and
flatly denied the existence of any broad and essential differences
in humanity sufficient to justify privilege, enslavement or
control. "No pre-natal subjugation," was its leading phrase. "No
pre-natal debt. Otherwise men cannot be free."</p>

<p>Elaborately Bodisham was working out the implications of this
proposition and applying them still more elaborately to the drift
of world events.</p>

<p>With this fundamental conception, the new movement faced the
world. This "fundamental conception" was the outer ring of
Bodisham's diagrams. But so far it hardly went beyond what
primitive Christianity, Islam, Anarchism, Rousseauism and all the
primary Leftisms, had said before it. Directly one came inside that
ample circle, however, the organisers of the new world found
themselves against certain practical realities, that so far had
frustrated every attempt to reduce human affairs to equalitarian
common-sense, and they faced them with an unprecedented
frankness.</p>

<p>"They just haven't been worked out," said Bodisham. "They just
haven't been worked out."</p>

<p>The chief of these practical difficulties on the way to human
unity was the fact that normal human beings are not by nature
interested in public affairs. That has always been the little rift
in the lute of sentimental democracy. Because man is not
instinctively political, as the ant seems to be, all his collective
operations have to be directed. Most human beings do not want to be
bothered looking after their common interests. They put the real
stuff of their individual lives before the common weal as a matter
of course. They may be educated or cowed into a practical respect
for the common weal, but that is against the natural disposition of
their hearts.</p>

<p>It was necessary, therefore, Bodisham argued, to find and select
and appoint people of a certain type&mdash;Rud called them
generally "masterful people"&mdash;who would take a special
interest in the direction and co-ordination of this or that
collective activity, whether it was crop-production or road-making
and maintaining, or improving and distributing the statement of
fact, or teaching or research or what not. The whole history of
mankind had been and was still and could not be anything else but
the struggle of the various types of these masterful men to get
collective processes established, either for their own advantage or
the collective advantage, against the general contrariety, the
resistances, the confused, shortsighted self-seeking and
self-protection of common individuals. Masterful men come to the
top under any conditions. But the peculiar sorts of masterful men
who come to the top depended on the conditions.</p>

<p>"The Common Man can only become conscious of himself and learn
his lesson through the exposition of certain peculiar sorts of
masterful men," argued Bodisham. "There are people who must 'say
it' for the inarticulate and generally inattentive common man. Call
them teachers, demagogues, prophets, what you will. Rud is
quintessentially that sort. That sort you must have. But also there
have to be experts and, furthermore, there have to be men to check
back, criticise and justify the expert and protect the Common Man
from either tyranny or quackery. All that complexity you must have
in human affairs. The essential problem is to use those necessary
masterful men and yet restrain them. How to balance them? How to
prevent their abusing their masterfulness? They must have authority
in their special fields, but you have to put simple Power out of
reach of everyone.</p>

<p>"That is why the eighteenth century, that most enlightened
century, that liberty-seeking century, was so preoccupied by
constitution-mongering, and why my great circle here is all cut up
by these minor circles and these schemes of mutual checks and
co-operations. All through the ages mankind in its communities has
relieved its political laziness and cowardice in an irrational
abandonment to leaders and rulers. God will provide, the King will
settle it, the priesthood will see to it, the aristocracy for the
sake of the land, the property-owners out of enlightened
self-interest, the lawyers, the oligarchy, 'They', the Party, the
Party leaders, the dictators..."</p>

<p>"The history of mankind," said Dreed, "has been a history of
betrayals, the perennial betrayal of the common man by the men he
has trusted."</p>

<p>"By the men the lazy, haphazard, childish oaf was too wilfully
stupid to mistrust," said Bodisham. "The history of mankind from
the very beginning has been a history of over-trusted trustees,
corrupted by their unchecked opportunities. And here in these
organisation diagrams I am simply trying to assemble in their
proper relations, the latest ideas for balancing the interests,
restraining the egotisms, and extracting the maximum of good out of
the masterfulness and the masterful phases of masterful men. It's
the eternal problem of politics&mdash;once again."</p>

<p>"The problem isn't eternal; it changes"; interrupted Rud. "The
conditions have changed. The fundamental conditions have changed.
What you don't realise fully enough, Bodisham, you with your
out-of-date historical precedents, is that all over the world there
is Awareness, such as there never was before. The light penetrates
everywhere. Knowledge, I tell you, wins its way. See how ideas
spread! See how they run. It's only now that natural science begins
to tell what it knows to the common mind. And common people drink
it up. For the first time the whole world reads, reads to know.
There is a new spirit in the world..."</p>

<p>It was always Bodisham who theorised and planned. Each main
function of the new world was presented in his diagram by systems
of circles and intersecting circles within. Here was the propaganda
system, and overlapping it and destined to replace it was organised
education. Here were the intimations of a plan for the correlation
of research and record and the distribution of knowledge. Here was
the organisation of force balanced against legal power. Here was a
quadrilateral of old military organisations, fading out before
police, controlled production and the air. Curious green lines
intimated the subtle but understandable relationship of "parallel
independent co-operation." Here, like an elucidatory veil across
this map of the future, was a mighty, new network of universities,
of record, discussion and information organisations, of poetry and
imaginative creation, that was to furnish the controlling
atmosphere of criticism and understanding throughout the world.</p>

<p>To anyone who saw these diagrams in the days before their
realisation, they would have seemed like the reveries of a very
intelligent but quite impracticable dreamer. Yet they were
certainly no more fantastic and far more constructive than was
Communism in the days when Marx at Highgate, bothered by
tradesmen's bills and earning a precarious living by discreet
political journalism, smoked and dreamed.</p>

<p>Plan or reverie, so it was that things shaped themselves in the
minds of the central group. The Group grew steadily as it
elaborated its conceptions of activity. Never was any revolutionary
scheme so little insurrectionary, so boldly and definitely
constructive, or so loosely centralised. Naturally the idea of
insurrection was fundamental to it, but conceptions of new
organisations completely overshadowed it. That idea of parallel
independent co-operation proved of the utmost practicability. Rud
in those days was not so much the head as the central link of the
group's scheme. Nothing so deliberate and detailed and adaptable as
Bodisham's net of diagrams had ever before been produced by the
revolutionary impulse in man. It resembled previous revolutionary
organisations as the working drawings for the first modern
aeroplane resembled the series of suicidal contrivances from the
wings of Daedalus onwards that had anticipated flying. After each
disaster people said "Man can never fly". But a few dreamers
persisted. After each revolutionary failure men said "Human society
can never escape from its traditional limitations. It must live or
perish in its self-made cage."</p>

<p>The Group was not of that opinion. It believed in the ultimate
victory of design and it was justified.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XVI</h3>

<p class="first">This ramifying group was extending its tentacles
to associate itself with types of revolutionary activity that were
either novel or had hitherto played a special disconnected r&ocirc;le in
human affairs. One of Bodisham's leading subdivisions within the
great circle was the conception of a cosmopolitan pronunciamento.
That would not be the Revolution but it would be an important
factor in it. There is no revolution while armed forces remain
loyal. Both he and Rud were alive to the truth that a few months'
drill and a uniform do not make a mechanism of the common man, and
now less than ever since warfare had been elaborated and
diversified by an incessantly varying equipment. Rulers make wars,
but soldiers, sailors, airmen and a complex of technicians carry
them on and end in control.</p>

<p>The universal human question: "Why should I do this for that
fellow when I might do it for myself?" was more alive than ever in
the ranks of the armed and enrolled specialists throughout the
world. There was a real psychological difference between the common
man and the man in uniform during the eighteenth century, almost as
different as the medieval distinctness of the man in armour, but
conscription has undermined that antagonism. A small army is the
ruler's weapon, but a great army becomes his master.</p>

<p>Bodisham produced voluminous instances of the revolutionary r&ocirc;le
of armies and fleets from the days of the successors of Alexander
and the legion-made Caesars down to contemporary Germany; he was
particularly erudite about Wallenstein and the condottieri, and
about the political side of the Scotch and English armies during
the seventeenth century. He invented a plausible history of the
Janissaries and he quoted the parts played by the fleets of Turkey,
Russia and Germany in reversing governments since 1900. There never
had been a fleet, he insisted, without a mutter of mutiny.</p>

<p>Now a new fighting type, the airman, was appearing in the world,
men necessarily of a wide geographical range, and all of them
living under practically identical conditions. What could prevent
their discovering that they had ideas in common, ideas that were
totally different from the military traditions of the sovereign
states that were so blandly assuming control of them.</p>

<p>"Even the Roman gladiators developed a solidarity of their own,"
said Bodisham. "The air is not really in the military tradition at
all. It is something different and new. It refuses to lend itself
to the soldier's tradition. It will develop its own tradition,
quite across the old national boundaries." It was one of the less
agreeable preoccupations of the military authorities in Britain and
America, he pointed out, to keep "seditious" literature away from
the "boys" upon the air grounds. "Which they don't," said Norvel,
the Group propagandist. "Which they can't. The more you militarise
a population, the less purely military the soldier becomes. The
more he is amenable to common-sense propaganda."</p>

<p>They found two vividly contrasted organisers for the
common-sense propaganda among the military forces of the State, in
Reedly, a disgruntled military genius and expert, with a gathering
animus against all constituted authority, based on some personal
grievance of his own against what he called the "privileged set",
and Bellacourt, a brilliant and quite disinterested aeronautical
engineer, who had served on the government side in the Spanish
Civil War and acquired an intense hatred of any kind of bombing.
Both had great energy and organising ability, and neither was in
complete harmony with the Rud-Bodisham-Chiffan-Steenhold gospel.
But they co-operated on "parallel independent" lines. Bellacourt
was a slight, very fair, taciturn, slow-thinking man, but Reedly
was a fine big figure of a soldier, built for a uniform and with a
big Kitchener moustache. He was conscious of his abilities and
impatient of what he thought to be inferior opinions. This
disposition, rather than any particular act, had hampered his
promotion. He came into the Group now as if he was leading in an
army. He came in with the almost naked purpose of showing the
authorities what a mistake they had made about him. He meant to use
the Group. Rud knew he was taking a risk with him. It was to be
remarked afterwards that Rud rarely interrupted Reedly while he was
talking, and that he watched his man even when he was taking no
part in the discussion.</p>

<p>Bellacourt, Rud realised early, was a man of one idea. He wanted
to take the air right out of national jurisdiction altogether, and
to make it a sort of separate world of transport by itself. He was
clear that this new mode of locomotion was quite outside the
current scheme of human life, but from that point his ideas were in
a sort of luminous fog. He wanted to isolate the air just as
Bendigo wanted to isolate the British Empire. He had, he said, been
studying the problem of the air for years, but his "studying" had
meant little more than writing and inducing others to write a
stream of pamphlets advocating what he called an "International Air
Force". By "international" he meant "cosmopolitan", but in those
days "cosmopolitan", for some obscure literary reason, was regarded
as a rude word, and "international" was always used instead. He did
not discuss how or why any existing government was to be induced to
abandon its control of its aviators and machines, and this omission
prevented any but a few salaried secretaries, benevolent spinsters
and the minor clergy from supporting his amiable proposals.</p>

<p>Bellacourt was a good airman and an inventive mechanician; he
had fought and he had tried to carry out a scheme of air
photography for the government side in the Spanish War, based on
Crawford's work, but conditions had not been favourable to that.
Before and after that experience he had played a considerable part,
both as an experimentalist and as a financier, in the development
of civil air transport. He was a man who did things rather than
thought, and his political and social ideas had remained at an
almost puerile level for years. "You just have to have an
International Air Control", and that was as far as he had got. He
really believed that existing governments might agree to abandon
air war.</p>

<p>Then something happened, some sort of afflatus, and his mind
took on a new power and energy. Perhaps in some pause in his
activities he had read a book or listened to someone, but at any
rate he discovered quite abruptly that the problem he had thought a
simple one was complicated in a great number of ways he had
disregarded, and particularly was it complicated by the fact that
nobody with any power to carry out his suggestions showed the
slightest disposition to do so. Once his mind was stirred he could
be a man of great practical determination. He came round to
Headquarters.</p>

<p>"I want a World Control of Aviation. Apparently that is
impossible without a revolution and a World State. I gather your
movement is out for that. Tell me about it." That was his simple
introduction of himself to Rud and Bodisham.</p>

<p>Rud sat back observant and let Bodisham explain.</p>

<p>The only way to make the aviation of the world a common world
interest, Bodisham explained, was to make every aviator in the air
services you could possibly convert, a believer in a Common World
Law and an opponent of nationalism. Bellacourt found this a hard
saying, and sat with a frown of perplexity on his fair, not
unhandsome face, one arm over the arm of his chair, resisting
it.</p>

<p>"I thought one might have world peace without this Red
stuff&mdash;simply through neutralising the air," he said, almost
as if he complained of them.</p>

<p>Bodisham elaborated his arguments. He and Rud were not "Reds",
he explained, and added under his breath, "Whatever Reds may
be".</p>

<p>Rud suggested that Bellacourt should go away for a week and
discuss his problem with everybody he met, the more anti-Red the
better. "You will find World Peace is only a single problem if you
deal with it as a whole," he said. "Then it becomes one and
ultimately indivisible. But you cannot deal with any part of
it&mdash;air union or what not&mdash;as a thing in itself. If other
things are not also going on at the same time, you will never get
anywhere with that. That is no reason, of course, why you
personally should not specialise absolutely upon the question of
the air. But in co-operation. We want you with us. We want a man
like you badly. We want an organiser of Common-sense and Common
Humanity in the Air. Just as we want someone to create a parallel
organisation in the shipping and in the war material industries.
For any service or industry or function, the real necessity is the
same. In each case you have to saturate the personnel with
identical clear ideas of their individual responsibility. You have
to free their minds from blind obedience. We want World-minded
Airmen. There is no need for any politics at all for you, and no
need for anyone to advocate this air solidarity of yours outside
the air forces&mdash;and the schools and technical schools and
factories that lead to the air. But all the same it will be in line
with everything else we are doing."</p>

<p>Bellacourt came back at the end of his week.</p>

<p>"I believe you are right," said Bellacourt compactly. "I have
thought it out. This air business is not to be done by itself. It
has to be done. I will join you for the sake of that."</p>

<p>Rud took a curious interest in Bellacourt's simplicity and
directness. It was something he had never met before to quite the
same extent. He talked to Chiffan about it. "Do you think machines
make men honest?" he said.</p>

<p>"They never take refuge in sentiment or rhetoric," said Chiffan,
"and if you try and cheat them they pay you back right away.
Whenever a machine goes wrong&mdash;it's <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"Bellacourt seems to me a machine-made man."</p>

<p>"I never saw anyone less like a Robot."</p>

<p>"But Robots," said Rud, "were man-made machines. I never felt so
sure I could trust anyone in my life&mdash;as Bellacourt."</p>

<p>"<i>This</i> to your oldest friend!"</p>

<p>"Bellacourt has no sense of humour," said Rud.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XVII</h3>

<p class="first">Another interesting addition to the Group was
Thirp, originally a philanthropic prison reformer, a man of some
wealth, whose political ideas it seemed were broadening with
experience, and who was specially interested in the police side of
life. He teemed with ideas about class and type psychology. He was
a small man with a thin, fine face and a feminine voice, and his
long, lean, restless hands seemed always to be handling details too
subtle for words. He had nothing of the conventional revolutionary
in his appearance; he was always very carefully dressed with large,
coloured neck-ties and delicately patterned silk shirts. He liked
what he called investigation, and sometimes his investigations
about public characters had the quality of personal gossip. Into
that, indeed, in a more stable age, he might have relapsed, but for
a time at least the movement picked him up and exalted and
nourished his mind. It gave his curiosities a purposive quality. He
was capable of handling big affairs and at a pinch he would do so,
but he preferred the secondary aspects of life.</p>

<p>He too became a separate process in the Party, most closely in
contact with Rud. He liked Rud and was curious about him. He was at
great pains to please him. He avoided the others, he cut the Group
meetings whenever he could, but he talked to Rud alone whenever he
had a chance. His brilliant little pamphlet, <i>The Man inside the
Uniform</i>, had had a circulation of over two million copies in
England and America before the British authorities condemned it as
a seditious document. On the whole that stimulated its
circulation.</p>

<p>Norvel again began as a loosely attached associate of the Group,
who gradually assumed a central position only second to the
nuclear, indefatigable Bodisham. He was a different kind of
tentacle altogether, who specialised in the publication and
distribution of cheap books on both sides of the Atlantic. He was a
born educator and propagandist. His distinctive excitement lay in
that. For that he lived. He it was who brought down the price of
paper-covered popular books in America to a dime. To most people in
those days a change in the price of books seemed trivial
commercialism, but he had a better imagination than that. It meant
a vast infiltration of rational ideas into previously inert social
masses. It meant a heightened social awareness, a step forward in
the awakening and release of the common man. Norvel had a
considerable genius for business; without any loss of revolutionary
zeal, he became one of the controlling magnates in the paper world,
and later, when wood pulp ran short, he exploited the manufacture
of paper out of light metallic alloys, to the great advantage of
the Party and the enquiring Common Man.</p>

<p>In his earlier schemes Bodisham had contemplated the development
of new daily newspapers as a necessary part of the Common-sense
Movement. Then Rud and he had found themselves doubting whether the
contemporary newspaper retained any political influence. It had
become more and more an ephemeral advertisment-sheet seasoned with
news of crimes, catastrophes and gossip. It was slipping away from
the centre of collective consciousness. As the big newspaper
proprietors realised the futility of their political ambitions,
they replaced political matter more and more by distraction. Many
daily papers were little more than personal gossip and photographic
pornography. Norvel confirmed Rud's ideas of the decadence of the
newspaper, and pushed them on to practical realisation. And most of
the accepted methods of party propaganda, meetings, processions and
so forth, he declared to be also completely out-of-date. Instead of
daily papers the Group ultimately found its chief educational
medium in small, cheap books of a size to go inconspicuously into a
working man's pocket, and before a year was out Norvel had filled
at least twenty million pockets where English was spoken, with the
stuff of the Common-sense Movement, and incalculable millions more
of minds with variations upon the question: "Why do you stand it?
Why do you let these out-of-date people play games with your bodies
and lives?"</p>

<p>"Out-of-date" is a very deadly phrase for an accepted
institution.</p>

<p>With the constant reiteration of this question, of why people
stood what they were enduring, went the plain, clear insistence
that in the world it was now possible to have peace and plenty for
all&mdash;given courage, given tolerance, given plain common-sense.
And this Norvel did at a monetary profit to the gathering movement.
These little books had much more frontier-passing power than a
newspaper that lives and dies in a day. They passed from hand to
hand. They played a vital part, a catalytic part, in the brewing of
the World Revolution.</p>

<h2><a id="chap3_02" name="chap3_02"></a>II. &mdash; HIGH TIDE OF
WORLD MUTINY</h2>

<h3>&sect; I</h3>

<p class="first">BODISHAM worked out his diagrams for a World
Revolution with infinite care and travail. The talks went on. The
Group grew in stature and wisdom. Events were not waiting for the
Group, they followed no leadership, they were hurrying the Group
along, creating new opportunities, confronting it with new
problems, subjecting it to fresh ideas. The state of human affairs
in the Brigand Forties was a climax of tension between the
traditional life of man and the intimations of a new world. Common
sense and every material reality insisted upon the unification of
human life throughout the planet and the socialisation of its
elementary needs, and pitted against that was the fact that every
authority, every institution, every established way of thinking and
living was framed to preserve the advantages of the ruling and
possessing minority and the separate sovereignty of the militant
states that had been evolved within the vanished circumstances of
the past.</p>

<p>The political states of the period, created by the puny
necessities of the foot-and-horse phase of human life, were now
like grapes in a wine-press being squeezed together. They pressed
upon, distorted and burst one another. Rud's idea of reconstructing
elementary political conceptions and general economic processes on
a world-wide scale was so obvious that now it scarcely seems
original. Yet the fact remains that to Rud's contemporaries,
schooled as they were in an unanalytical history and blind
traditionalism, such ideas had seemed extravagantly impossible
until his coarse, unqualified assertion of the harsh reality of the
human situation swept their inhibitions aside. They may have had
some anticipation of the new world order deep down in their minds,
but until he and his Group began bawling up the new world, and
bawling down the world of accepted practice, they seemed incapable
of any practical realisations.</p>

<p>Dr. Chanter, in his brilliant <i>History of Human Thought in the
Twentieth Century</i>, has made the suggestion that only a very
small proportion of people are capable of acquiring new ideas of
political or social behaviour after they are twenty-five years old.
On the other hand, few people become directive in these matters
until they are between forty and fifty. Then they prevail for
twenty years or more. The conduct of public affairs therefore is
necessarily twenty years or more behind the living thought of the
times. This is what Dr. Chanter calls the "delayed realisation of
ideas".</p>

<p>In the less hurried past this had not been of any great
importance, but in the violent crises of the Revolutionary Period
it became a primary fact. It is evident now that whatever the
emergency, however obvious the new problem before our species in
the nineteen-twenties, it was necessary for the whole generation
that had learned nothing and could learn nothing from the Great War
and its sequelae, to die out before any rational handling of world
affairs could even begin. The cream of the youth of the war years
had been killed; a stratum of men already middle-aged remained in
control, whose ideas had already set before the Great War. It was,
says Chanter, an inescapable phase. The world of the Frightened
Thirties and the Brigand Forties was under the dominion of a
generation of unteachable, obstinately obstructive men, blinded
men, miseducating, misleading the baffled younger people for
completely superseded ends. If they could have had their way, they
would have blinded the whole world for ever. But the blinding was
inadequate, and by the Fifties all this generation and its
teachings and traditions were passing away, like a smoke-screen
blown aside.</p>

<p>Before a few years had passed it was already incredible that in
the twenties and thirties of the twentieth century the whole
political life of the world was still running upon the idea of
competitive sovereign empires and states. Men of quite outstanding
intelligence were still planning and scheming for the "hegemony" of
Britain or France or Germany or Japan; they were still moving their
armies and navies and air forces and making their combinations and
alliances upon the dissolving chess-board of terrestrial reality.
Nothing happened as they had planned it; nothing worked out as they
desired; but still with a stupefying inertia they persisted. They
launched armies, they starved and massacred populations. They were
like a veterinary surgeon who suddenly finds he is operating upon a
human being, and with a sort of blind helplessness cuts and slashes
more and more desperately, according to the best equestrian rules.
The history of European diplomacy between 1914 and 1944 seems now
so consistent a record of incredible insincerity that it stuns the
modern mind. At the time it seemed rational behaviour. It did not
seem insincere. The biographical material of the period&mdash;and
these governing-class people kept themselves in countenance very
largely by writing and reading each other's biographies&mdash;the
collected letters, the collected speeches, the sapient observations
of the leading figures make tedious reading, but they enable the
intelligent student to realise the persistence of small-society
values in that swiftly expanding scene.</p>

<p>Those values had to die out. There was no other way of escaping
from them, and so, slowly and horribly, that phase of the moribund
sovereign states concluded.</p>

<p>Beneath the formal surface of their traditional politics the
historian of human thought notes the whispering advance of the
Common Man's Party. There can be no question of the value of the
phrase "parallel independent co-operation" in preventing it from
congealing into a centralised political dogmatism, after the
precedent of Communism. It was becoming a power, as formless as
hydraulic pressure, adapting itself to the particular situations in
which it discovered itself. It was everywhere a spirit of critical
resistance to authority, resistance not in the name of ease and
indolence but in the name of efficiency, this spreading conception
of a common aim for all human beings. It was the resistance of son
to arbitrary father, of pupil to dogmatic and inexplicit
teacher.</p>

<p>The essential question was always "Who are these fellows who
give us orders? By what warrant? And how do we benefit and how does
the world benefit? But they are doing no good to anyone, no real
good even to themselves! This is not government and leadership;
this is imposture. Why stand it?...Why stand it?"</p>

<p>The lingering disposition on the part of humanity to personify
its general creative drive, that curious diffidence, that
persistent infantilism, that made it necessary to ascribe its own
urgencies to an outside authority, played its part even from the
beginning in Rud's elevation. He became the living symbol of the
new world. The same imaginative needs that in the past had evoked
the legends of Hercules and Prometheus and Moses, fixed now upon
Rud. He has still to have a halo woven for him by great art and
music and poetic suggestion, his is indeed still a very uncertain
halo, but his essential r&ocirc;le in the human imagination was the same.
It became his function to say the things men dared not say for
themselves. He was The Word. Even Rud himself doubted at times
whether some masterful pronouncement had not been said first as it
were in the world at large and then through him. But the world at
large had no such doubts.</p>

<p>The logic of human necessity was bringing the essentials of
readjustment into the foreground of the racial mind,
simultaneously, round and about the planet. It was sweeping along
leaders and adventurers, reactionaries and revolutionaries,
masterful men, weaklings and criminals, towards the simplified
issues of a renascent world. It was sweeping our Rud along with the
rest, but sweeping him now into a foremost place, because of the
fact that his vanities and ambitions were sustained by those queer
phases of lucidity of his, by his swift intellectual
acquisitiveness, and by those outbursts of speech and impulse that
predestined him to be, even as he professed to be, the megaphone of
the common will and understanding of mankind.</p>

<p>Thus it was fate dealt with him. The mighty, impersonal forces
of a world transition, seized upon our scheming little Rud and
whirled him higher and higher, until he found himself nominally and
physically the head of a new system into which the storm of
necessity was forcing the world. It took him and exalted him. His
reverie of a new world turned to reality and expanded to exceed his
wildest dreams.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; II</h3>

<p class="first">One might write a very intricate history of the
idea of Rud in the world. Always there has been fantasy and
falsification in the picture. To begin with, the circulation of his
actual portrait was restricted. Instead of a confusing spray of
photographs, two friendly studies of him in the pose of a
thoughtful Beethoven established a visible personality for him.
Later, when snapshots became frequent, these sketches dominated
their interpretation. He would never allow himself to be
photographed speaking. He had studied the self-exposures of Hitler
and Mussolini very carefully, and there survives no portrait of him
with his mouth open. Neither was there any legend of his early
upbringing in circulation in those early years. "Never mind what
<i>I</i> am or where <i>I</i> come from," was his response to the
enquiring journalist. "It's what <i>you</i> are, and what you
think, and whether what I say is right for you."</p>

<p>Millions of people did not know whether this Rud Whitlow they
spoke of was English or American. Millions thought of him as a
wise, secluded old gentleman. His white face had been noted and
commented upon. In America there was a whispered legend that he was
dying slowly of consumption. Another story gave him an unspecified
disease in the marrow of his bones that inflicted the most
frightful suffering upon him. Sometime, it was said, the surgeons
had to saw open the marrow of a bone to relieve him. That gave him
the support of many who otherwise might not have suffered his
dominance. It was hard to envy a man who moved with pain and harsh
to resist one who might be dead to-morrow. There were countless
allusions to his tragic loneliness, and a number of religious
ministers everywhere believed in and expatiated upon his intense
"love of mankind". He hated cruelty, oppression, needless want and
war, they said, and he not only hated them but he worked out the
way of relief from all these things.</p>

<p>Men liked his radio voice. He had studied the best models. From
Tierra del Fuego to Spitzbergen and from China to Peru, there was
an expectation that the time for a not very clearly imagined
world-wide crisis was drawing near, and that when Rud said "Go",
the great day of the Common Man would dawn.</p>

<p>He knew how to arrest this otherwise unstanchable flow of
informal warfare, more obviously aimless every year, that still
distressed the world. He held the secret of World Peace and a
Common Law. So they believed. The Commonsense of Things; the Common
Law, the World in Common; these phrases had an effect of limitless
release and enfranchisement from pole to pole.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; III</h3>

<p class="first">The strike is one of the oldest phases of the
warfare between the generality and the overbearing man. The common
man comes to a point when his exploitation becomes unendurable, and
he puts down his implements and says: "No more". In a rational
order this leads to a discussion of the situation and a
readjustment of relationships. On ships and in militant armies,
however, where the masterful men have elaborated the idea and
methods of "discipline", force comes into play forthwith, the
strike takes the form of mutiny, and the masterful man, if he is
not to be obeyed implicitly, has to be shot or put in irons or
overboard. This is the natural consequence of overstressing
mastery. The ultimate way of preserving human dignity in the face
of arbitrary compulsion is to kill. Here reason and primordial
instinct are in complete agreement.</p>

<p>The idea of a mutiny against belligerent governments, against
<i>all</i> existing governments, seeped infectiously through the
world. "Before there can be any world government," said Rud in one
of his phases of vivid conviction, "men must realise that
<i>all</i> their governments are wrong. No existing government can
become a world government, and a world government cannot be a
large-scale imitation of any existing government. It must be a new
thing embodying a universal mutiny."</p>

<p>There had already been a foretaste of this mutinous reaction
towards the end of the Great War of 1914-18. All the European
fighting forces then were drifting to mutiny. The essential Russian
Revolution was a mutiny, and the sit-down strikes of the early
twenties in Italy and elsewhere, which immobilised factories and
the mechanical plant of civilisation, not by the withdrawal of
labour but by its cessation, were plainly experiments of the common
man in his revolt against servitude and the exploitation of his
necessities. These earlier efforts had failed because they had been
local and regional. They had been premature. They had anticipated
the necessary approximations and coalescences. They had occurred in
a world which was still in a patchwork of dissimilar phases.</p>

<p>It was only now, with the abolition of remoteness, that the
entire world was coming into step as one community. Now it was no
longer possible to crush revolt in one region before another became
aware of the general significance of the struggle. Bodisham and
Norvel were particularly energetic and efficient in developing what
Rud called this "Simultaneous Awareness" throughout the world. By
1944 there was not a country or region in the world where the
"Common Man's Party" was not known, where Rud's beetling forehead
had not become the familiar symbol for a vaguely apprehended, vast
organisation of release, and where the essential conditions of any
conflict against limited, impatient and outworn authority were
unknown. All over the world there grew up a solidarity of
expectation, a sense of a new order not simply dreamt of, but
prepared and approaching.</p>

<p>Those who were most concerned with what still passed for
government in those days seem to have been the least aware of the
essential connection of a hundred apparently divergent movements
that undermined the superficial orderliness of life. Whenever for
example there was still definitely an organised military
suppression of social adjustment, there was what one may describe
compactly and brutally as a "Shoot the officers" movement. This was
more apparent in what were then called the authoritarian
communities than in those which claimed to be democratic. But it
was by no means confined to them. The Nazis for example had never
displayed the internal discipline of the old German armies, and
there was clear evidence as early as 1939 that the leaders did not
dare impose too severe an obedience upon the looting and raping
with which the rank and file repaid themselves for the fatigues of
warfare. The men put their own interpretation upon their duties,
and treated any attempts to moderate their behaviour as disloyalty
to their <i>esprit de corps</i>. The Japanese staffs and officers
again were often too manifestly compelled and terrified men, as the
discipline of the hungry and ill-paid hordes of armed Japanese
peasants that still swarmed in China relaxed. By 1939 Japan, for
instance, in China, and Italy in Spain, had armies that the
government dared not bring home.</p>

<p>There was a constant repetition of the same cycle of phases in
the experience of the various demoralised army fragments, great and
small, which were now scattered over half the land surface of the
globe. First came insubordination, "shoot the officers" and "lead
us, Caesar, where we want to go"; a phase of successful
lawlessness, a phase of rapine; then a feeling of isolation and
fear and a great desire to link up again to some greater order.
Bodisham and his staff, watching the world from their headquarters,
had great maps flagged to mark down "contrite" troops. Most of
these troops had heard vaguely of Rud. As apprehension grew in
their minds they would usually claim that they were new
revolutionaries, Rud's men. And the countries subjected to lawless
brigandage and themselves forced towards counter-brigandage, found
their only hope of restoring firm control in the anticipation of a
World Common Law. They too claimed to be part of the great
reconstruction. Every region too was now infested with
de-nationalised exiles. Their dominant idea was to be legitimated
as some new type of citizen. There comes a phase in social
dislocation when the desire for order and security, for peaceful
living overpowers partisanship, jealousy, possessiveness...</p>

<p>After the great naval losses in the first year of the War of the
Ideologies and the development of the military deadlock in Central
America and the Old World, the strike method assumed formidable
dimensions both in the air forces and among the munition workers.
These latter, as they realised their indispensability, began to
refuse delivery of particular types of bombs and other weapons
whose use they considered inimical to the common interest. The
propaganda of Bellacourt had quickened the consciences of the
airmen. Everywhere the air forces displayed a disposition to
question the decisions of the military authorities. The roar of the
planes overhead no longer gave the statesmen and politicians on the
ground below a sense of unqualified power. They began to worry
about the morale of the air forces, to organise espionage systems
among these youngsters.</p>

<p>The propaganda organisations of the disintegrating national
governments did an immense amount of work in the spread of the idea
of Rud. Each assailed the prestige of its formal antagonists, and
found an authority in his phrases, each in undermining the enemy
morale sapped its own. Each appealed to Common Justice and the
Common-sense of Mankind against its rival. In France and Britain
Rud's activities were largely sustained by German money. In Germany
his spreading reputation was financed and abetted by Russian,
French and British propaganda. Russia paved his way in China and
Japan, Germany and Russia in India. The Catholic Church denounced
him in one country and claimed him in another, but everywhere it
spread his name. There is no better advertisement in the world than
to be denounced by an unattractive priest or teacher. With the most
definite intentions possible, Rud could still find it the best
policy to remain ambiguous. He was vaguely supposed to be
revolutionary and "creative", and at the same time he was supposed
to be anti-Red. In reality he was ultra-Radical, he left the Reds
far behind him. The Common Man emerged at last less by a process of
assertion than by a progressive elimination of narrower
alternatives.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; IV</h3>

<p class="first">The Last War on Earth, the Second War to End War,
when at last it could be envisaged as a whole, was a huge,
ill-managed tangle of conflicts which began informally and did not
so much end as peter out. It is difficult to imagine how it could
have followed any other course. It was incoherent from start to
finish. The name it still carries, "The Ideological War", was first
devised for it by that interesting, rhetorical, quasi-intellectual,
the Italian Dictator, Benito Mussolini. He too in his time, with
his bright phases and his long, heavy interludes, was something of
a minor Holy Terror, an opera-tenor Rud.</p>

<p>Already people are beginning to forget Mussolini's r&ocirc;le in the
restatement of human life. He is following Napoleon into oblivion
as a mere energetic personality of no fundamental importance at
all. The tendency when he is mentioned is to belittle him. But he
was by no means a fool. His fustian was absurd and inconsistent but
it was not contemptible. He was a man relatively intelligent among
contemporary "strong men"; he had had early experiences of
discussion and editorship, and his mind, like that of his Corsican
precursor, ran habitually to obvious and often very attractive
headlines. He was mentally excitable and as his temperature rose
his headlines flushed. He wanted to figure as a Great Man in
history, and he was quite unable to foresee the unromantic turn
that history was taking.</p>

<p>He realised that for any effective victory in warfare there must
be two sides and not more than two sides, but he failed to grasp
the further fact that warfare may end without effective victory. He
got his antagonisms wrong. The stresses and confusions of the world
were more and more manifestly the outcome of the struggle of all
the diverse forces making for a common-sense world state, against
the obsolescent political, economic, religious and educational
institutions, endlessly varied in origin and character, that
obstructed them. But he thought the nationalist forms of history
were permanent. The primary reality of the age was a world-wide
conflict of pressures, parallel all over the world, for which the
new order had still to find its definite formulae. To this his own
obsessions blinded him completely.</p>

<p>Benito Mussolini, with a surfeit of bad history decaying in his
imagination, could not see the plain realities before him. Like
most of his generation he dramatised human affairs in incurably
geographical patches, and like most of the masterful men of his
time his belief in his power to mould the life about him carried
him beyond sanity. From the beginning his was an ill-balanced
temperament; he would be blatant at one moment, and weeping at
another. He beat at the knees of Mother Reality like an unteachable
child. He wanted war and conquest, triumph over definable enemies,
fierce alliances, and unforgettable antagonisms. He wanted glory.
He died, as his last words testify, completely unaware of the fact
that the rational treatment of human affairs does not admit of that
bilaterality which the traditions of warfare require. "Do we win?"
he said.</p>

<p>He persuaded himself and he persuaded great multitudes of people
that two great systems of ideas faced each other in the world,
"Leftism" and "Rightism", and that he and his associated Dictators
embodied the latter. He did contrive finally to impose the illusion
of a definitive World War upon great masses of people.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; V</h3>

<p class="first">In this story of Rud's career we are happily free
to ignore the intricate controversies that centre about the riddle
of what Right and Left or Red or Fascist or the "authoritarian" and
the "democratic" state really signified at any particular time and
place.</p>

<p>There is an immense literature on the subject, abundantly
unread, but still being patiently added to by the erudite. This
material is subjected to micro-photography, indexed and so put away
out of danger, with so much more of the excessive material of this
age of excessive record. It is doubtful if it will ever find any
useful application. It goes on and on. It is like Christian
theology; it is like the bubbling of salted snails in a pail.</p>

<p>The fact remains that by the fifth decade of the twentieth
century there was still a sufficient air of alignment between the
two factions for formal diplomacy, alliance and secret treaties to
continue. On the one hand, the confused mentalities of the groups,
classes and individuals in positions of authority and possession
were all sufficiently apprehensive of an advancing rationalisation
of human affairs which would call them to account, to be
consolidated in a general defensive offensive against something
called "Democracy" or "Leftism" or "Reds" or "The Devil"; while on
the other a certain number of governments, the so-called
"democracies", were less able to make head against the expression
of the renascence of common-sense Radicalism and had to pay at
least lip-service to the creative forces of the world. The profound
and subtle ambiguity of Russia, a fanatical bureaucracy professing
the supremacy of the proletariat, sprawled perplexingly, with its
internecine feuds and recriminations, across this complex of human
interpretations. And still imposed upon the whole fermenting mass
were the old boundaries, the old Foreign Offices, the old military
and naval traditions, doddering and yet dangerous, that had so
astonishingly survived the Great War of 1914-1918.</p>

<p>With a futile sense of complete reassurance the official mind
found itself at last definitely at war again. There were actual
declarations of war quite like old times. "Who said war was over?"
the old order demanded, scared but glad.</p>

<p>"Now we know where we are," they said, when as a matter of fact
they knew less than ever where they were. The city crowds cheered,
the armies went tanking forward, the expensive navies, according to
the best naval traditions, hid from each other in remote inlets
behind powerful booms, the bulletins lied even when there was no
object in their lying, the planes roared overhead, the bombs
crashed, the cities burst, people ran this way and that, clapped on
silly gas masks and crowded out inadequate shelters until they were
squashed or smashed or suffocated or starved, many millions of
living, feeling, human beings were converted into red pulps and
messes, and the Great War of the Ideologies moved on for a time,
according to the best precedents, to no perceptible objective
whatever. For the first six or seven months there was a tornado of
battle. Everywhere one was at the front, so to speak, and the
entire planet practically under fire. The tale of destruction is as
monstrous as it is frightful; it baffled piety, it mocked heroics,
philosophy refuses to entertain it, its records remain unread; only
very old gentlemen who were in it con that history now for purposes
of reminiscence; with a natural human callousness life has gone on
and the dead past has buried its dead. Yet even at the time there
was a certain amount of cheerfulness, a sense of adventure
successfully surmounted, among those who survived. Many of those
engaged in these conflicts were too excited to be distressed by
their sufferings. Great accumulations of men and war material came
into collision and remained in conflict for days and weeks with
much slaughter and destruction; and the contemporary historian,
trying, at any cost to the truth, to keep up his continuity with
the past, called them "battles" and even explained what advantages
were gained by them and how, in a technical sense, they decided
this or that.</p>

<p>The land war ebbed before the first year was out. In the
previous world war there had been a vast accumulation of material
wealth to draw upon, and from the beginning to end the supply of
men and material increased, to the universal amazement, as though
there was no limit to human resources. But the War of the
Ideologies followed quite a different course. It began almost at a
maximum of equipment, and with populations incapable of much
further effort and sacrifice. Armament deteriorated very rapidly at
last; instead of the crescendo of 1914-18, there was a more and
more perceptible diminuendo. Essential substances were giving out.
Makeshift came into its own in the fighting line and famine spread
behind it. And then came mutiny. The men of the dwindling air
forces, urged to go up in less and less trustworthy machines, and
the people in the overstrained munition factories, increasingly
dangerous as skilled workers became rarer and material degenerated,
passed from reluctance to sabotage and flat refusal.</p>

<p>The European "authoritarian" warships so far overcame the
battle-shyness of their crews as to put to sea in order to sweep
the Atlantic; and their allies, the Japanese, got across the
Pacific to shell and partially destroy San Francisco, cover a
futile landing at Panama and another at Valparaiso, round Cape
Horn, effect a sort of junction with the authoritarians after the
destruction of Gibraltar, and fight that confused series of heroic
rearguard engagements known as the Battle of the South Atlantic.
For nearly a week the battleships of the world, those magnificent
pieces of lethal engineering, careered about the seas, greatly
afflicted by aeroplanes and submarines, and a bent and battered
remnant got back to shelter again. And there it became manifest to
the horrified captains that that was where their men intended to
remain until the war was over.</p>

<p>Naval strategy became more and more a business of concealing
this reality from the opposite side. That last naval war was indeed
much more like a panic in a contentious Mothers' Meeting with a
wasps' nest upset and mice on the floor, than it was to any of the
set naval conflicts of the past. It was monstrous and tragic but
also it was intensely ridiculous. After the surviving warships had
been tucked away again out of harm's way, the residue of admirals
on both sides went ashore, launched into authorship, and after a
prolonged campaign, produced the curves of that truncated conflict
to fully demonstrated victories. Everybody who had not been drowned
or blown out of the water and had escaped to tell the tale,
discovered that he and his side had won. The more these gallant
survivors wrote, the completer their victories became. There are
people who still find an interest in these highly technical
discussions.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VI</h3>

<p class="first">Under the stresses of this War of the Ideologies
the quality of the net of Radical organisations the Common-sense
Movement had woven about the world was put to the test. And it
held. People are only beginning to appreciate the sweeping power of
Bodisham's planning, the versatile energy of Norvel and the
understanding and unobtrusive competence that appeared almost
everywhere ready to co-operate with the Group. Great numbers of
capable men had been waiting for some such lead. It was a far
broader, more varied and flexible revolutionary system than had
ever existed before. It risked no subtleties of strategy; its
general direction was definite but broad, and capable of the freest
adaptation to special needs and circumstances.</p>

<p>The general decision of Common-sense upon the war had no
ambiguity. "Now," it said, "we fight. We will fight", the
Common-sense people agreed, "against the intensive war-makers, and
for those who propose to liberate. But we have had time to digest
the lessons of the Great War, and everywhere we are going to fight
conditionally, as free men and women. The governments we support
shall justify their professions. They shall not merely pretend to
liberate. They shall liberate indeed. This is no war between Make
Believes. It is a plain fight to obliterate the very idea of a
soldier from men's minds. This is a War to end War..."</p>

<p>Rud talked out the war issue to the Central Group but there was
very little discussion. The Group had already shifted its
headquarters to Sloten near Amsterdam, close to the new radio
centre and the air-port. There, in a large room like a departmental
board-room, surrounded with maps and Bodisham's later diagrams, Rud
expounded his fundamental plan of campaign.</p>

<p>He banged the table and spluttered with subversive
bitterness.</p>

<p>"The war to end war...That is what we are fighting. Over again.
Never have sane words been so mocked at, and never were saner words
uttered. Someone used that phrase for the last war, and it didn't
end war. Ha-ha-ha and He-he-he and also Yah! But obviously there
has to be a war to end war&mdash;and if that fails, another. And if
necessary, another and another. How else in the name of the
Everlasting White Rabbit, do you think we are going to end war? It
isn't really funny that the first War to End War failed to do so.
That was a great joke for the Conchies&mdash;it seemed to prove
them right&mdash;but for mankind it was a disaster. It proves
nothing that we were cheated by the old gang. Nothing at all. Peace
is organised strength. Peace is the discipline of commonsense.</p>

<p>"The last war to end war miscarried. The world wasn't prepared
for the idea. The common man didn't realise his opportunity. Very
well, since then <i>we'v</i>e been busy. Maybe <i>this</i> one
won't miscarry. If it does, it will be because <i>we</i> in our
turn weren't up to the job. This time the common man has got to get
and keep control. This time we have to save the world from the old
confidence tricks. We English aren't going to fight <i>this</i>
war, simply and trustfully, under General Timberface and Colonel
Blimp with the Army of the Aldershot Tattoo. The crown and the army
class and the Anglican padres are not going to jump this war as
they jumped our war in 1914. <i>We've</i> got to see to that.
Nobody is going to stick up proclamations about '<i>My</i> army and
<i>my</i> subjects' in this war, without a protest from us. Let one
thing be clear. It is we, the Common Men, who fight, and there are
no '<i>my</i> subjects'. We don't mean to cheer the cuckoo-clock at
Buckingham Palace at the end of this war. No. It will be
<i>ours</i> from first to last.</p>

<p>"The generals and colonels won't jump us this time. Not if we
know it. This war has to be won, and won for its definite end, and
there's not going to be any other sort of winning about it. These
army duffers didn't know how to conduct a war in 1914 when
everything was as easy as pie&mdash;Heavens, what a mess they made
of it! They had every card in their silly hands in 1916. I've heard
decent men talk about it. Now everybody&mdash;even they
themselves&mdash;everybody knows they can't conduct a modern war.
If a modern war <i>can</i> be conducted. They don't know anything
about it. They are just backward boys from backward schools a
hundred years out of date. What we are calling a War now is really
the opening phase of world amalgamation, it is not a war in the
historical sense at all, and the only use we have for our armies
now is to destroy the enemy armies and get them out of the way of
civilian world controls. This war has to be fought with cards on
the table and in the open daylight, with common-sense intervening
at every point. Most of that Secret Service of theirs is just a
screen to protect the incapables from public criticism. Official
Secrets are usually officials' secrets. Never trust a General; let
every man under him watch his work. He's no divinity. Why, some of
those tin hats in the last war; the men didn't even give them
nicknames. Think of that! The men didn't know enough about them.
Even for that. Everywhere, all over the earth, we've got to have
our organisations saying: 'We mean to help in the war. Mean to be
told. Mean to know. What do you think you are doing to me? I am a
man. What's the idea of clapping me in a uniform and telling me to
shut up and do what I am told? That's how you lost the last war for
us...Not <i>tell</i> us? Because the enemy might get to know
something! It isn't what the enemy knows, it is what <i>we</i> know
that will win the war. And we mean to know it.'"</p>

<p>"That's the spirit of course," said Chiffan a little
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"After every big fight," said Rud, "I think the men ought to
re-elect their officers."</p>

<p>"That's the spirit," said Reedly, as though an endorsement was
expected from him. "That's the spirit, as Chiffan says. I agree. I
agree essentially. To the spirit of that. As a modern soldier.
Cannon fodder is out of fashion. We want an army alive to its
objectives&mdash;capable of carrying on if every officer was shot.
Give me an army in which every man is fit to step forward and take
the place of the man who has dropped out. So far the common soldier
must be a responsible man. Yes...Still, there are occasions and
necessities...There are times for implicit obedience..."</p>

<p>So Reedly, the "soldier of democracy", sitting square at the
middle of the table and already beginning to look a little less
like a not too confident deserter, and more like a commander of
men.</p>

<p>Then Rud made a speech he had had brewing in his mind for some
time. And as he made it, he watched its reception by Reedly.</p>

<p>"Secrecy," he said, and paused.</p>

<p>"Capable commanders will always know when to keep their own
counsel&mdash;at their own risk," said Rud. "It's all too
easy&mdash;all too easy&mdash;to get blind obedience if the men
believe in their leaders. They <i>like</i> a leader to do the
decisions. But I'm not only thinking of the war; I'm thinking of
the end of the war. The vital thing about any rational war is its
end. Only sadistic idiots in moments of rhetoric think of war as a
thing in itself. You might as well think of a railway accident as a
thing in itself. In some fashion or other this war is certainly
going to be won by the Radical and quasi-Radical powers. Not a
doubt about it. They've got mass, they've got endurance, they've
got adaptability. There will be no separate peace. Make sure of
that.</p>

<p>"In some fashion or other this war will be won, I say. There's
the rub. That's where the catch comes in. What we do not want is to
see the war won in the name of liberty, at the price of liberty.
Gently but firmly the common man has to take over from the
diplomats and professional soldiers before the war is allowed to
end. Even if it takes longer. On the other side as well it's
necessary to have not simply defeat but real revolution. In 1918
the Great War was hushed up in a hurry because of the manifest
imminence of revolution and Communism from the Urals to the
Atlantic. The Armistice of 1918 was the <i>sauve qui peat</i> of
the old order from the dawning understanding of the common
man...</p>

<p>"Didn't you realise that? It's not documented, no. Maybe they
didn't realise it. But that was the drive in their minds. Our
common man now is ten times as clear-headed and made of tougher
stuff. He's never recovered <i>faith</i> anywhere, since the Great
War.</p>

<p>"In 1918 there was no one to say 'A Common Law for the World'.
Now everywhere, we say it. That's what we are for. That
particularly and exactly is what we are for."</p>

<p>He paused. Reedly pulled his moustache. He seemed to be taking
counsel with himself, a strong, silent man, but he made no comment
on Rud's declaration.</p>

<p>"I could not state our idea more clearly," said Rud. "If I could
I would."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VII</h3>

<p class="first">With intentions thus defined and elaborated, the
Group faced the formal outbreak of the War of Ideologies. They
spread their tentacles as Bodisham had planned them, and the
combatant and authoritative forces in the world, seeking to use
their propaganda, were gripped by its implications. The Group
undertook responsibilities and achieved recognition. Insensibly it
became a power in the world. It became an intermediary and then a
decisive intermediary. Its informality and apparent flexibility
made it more convenient and more non-committal than the official
modes of communication between the Allied Democracies.</p>

<p>Few people remarked the rapid gradations by which this Party
from nowhere and everywhere became a world institution. A year and
a half of chaotic warfare and it was quasi-official. The winding up
of the war drew near.</p>

<p>So eighteen months to a day after its decision to take part in
the war, the Group met in that same room at Sloten. But now they
were all wearing the plain grey uniform of New World Police, and
the Dutch War Minister and a number of officers of the Consolidated
Air Forces were with them. The maps upon the wall had undergone
great changes.</p>

<p>The Common-sense Party was in practical and legal control of
Holland. The Common-sense Government had an overwhelming majority
there. This was true now of ten of the pseudo-democratic powers.
And the Group had become the chief consolidating organ of all the
allies. The shattered and exhausted militant states had realised
its menace for them too late. First they had tried to make use of
it under the impression that it was a pacifist influence that would
weaken discipline in the Allied Armies. Then discovering that its
ideas were permeating backward into their own ranks, they had
attempted a futile suppression which had merely strengthened its
hold on the Allies. And now the Group was discussing the campaign
that would wind up the war, and it had met at the initiative of
Reedly who, with an air of subordination that hardly pretended to
conceal his growing insolence, had demanded "instructions" from his
colleagues. The war, he said, was approaching its final
decision.</p>

<p>He had long since abandoned his place at the middle of the table
and shifted to the end, so that he faced Rud, and he was speaking
now with the air of a reasonable man who exercises self-control in
spite of much provocation. "I protest," he said.</p>

<p>He had evidently come charged with that word.</p>

<p>Chiffan's mind went wandering in search of a quotation.
"Methinks"&mdash;how did it go&mdash;who was it&mdash;"doth protest
too much..."</p>

<p>Reedly was speaking, and Rud was regarding him with brow-knitted
attention. Bodisham, at the middle of the table, said very little,
but looked occasionally at Rud. Once or twice Rud and he exchanged
glances. Dreed and Norvel, the men responsible for education and
public information, Thirp for the police liaison everywhere,
Steenhold, Irwell, Roots and Holbank, for production, and
Bellacourt, the director of air communications, were all, it
appeared, treating Reedly unreasonably and unfairly. He wanted the
situation cleared up and he wanted to be entrusted with greater
powers. There was a demand and a menace in all he had to say.</p>

<p>His position was a peculiar one. The necessity of a unified
Allied Command had been forced upon the Democratic Powers by a
series of military defeats in the European area. But the bitterness
of wilful mutual sabotage had made the direct subordination of the
acutely nationalist national forces, to the direction of any single
commander among them, impossible. The British Premier's idea of a
Liaison Minister, who might develop insensibly into an Allied
Commander-in-Chief, was felt to be a brilliant one. It was also the
Prime Minister's idea to look to the left for this Liaison
Minister. The revolutionary strikes of great sections of the
munition workers and the refusal of the unified air forces, after
the Authoritarians had been virtually driven from the air, to
continue to take orders from any source except their representative
Bellacourt, had turned the Allied Governments to Reedly as the most
hopeful intermediary for a restoration of their internal as well as
their international solidarity. Reedly was manifestly far less
"Red" and revolutionary in spirit than his associates, essentially
he was a good soldier, and nevertheless he was in contact, or he
professed to be in contact, with the entire Group, and he became in
rapid succession Liaison Minister and then "World Marshal" of the
Allied Armies. His commission was vague and he interpreted it as
conferring upon him the supreme command over all the forces of the
Democratic Powers. There was little resistance to his aggressions.
On the whole the allied commanders were not averse to shifting
their responsibility to a man who might be set aside at the general
settlement. So in a couple of years this disgruntled military
expert, this detractor with a grievance, had become an arrogant and
aggressive soldier again.</p>

<p>"I come here from the active front and Bellacourt is not here to
meet me."</p>

<p>"He is in America," said Rud, "he is dealing with the strike.
And Thirp, too, is busy&mdash;elsewhere."</p>

<p>"But I need them here. Bellacourt particularly. Believe me, I
cannot wind up this war without his effective cooperation. I cannot
do it."</p>

<p>He put out his open, hairy hand on the table and clutched, as
though he grasped the world.</p>

<p>He was now a fine, florid, soldierly figure. He had expanded
physically. His elocution had improved. A certain cantankerous note
was no longer audible. Thirp, who missed nothing, had pointed out
to Rud that he had acquired an artificial wave in his hair.
"Vanity," said Thirp, "or ambition? Some vanity, of course. After
all, ambition is only vanity with a backbone. That wave photographs
better. It makes better personal propaganda..."</p>

<p>Steenhold found Reedly as admirable as an eighteenth-century
portrait of a general. He deserved a background of
battle-smoke&mdash;and a horse. A prancing horse with red nostrils.
He was certainly the finest-looking captain of men the Group could
have produced. He quite outshone the stockish Rogers, who had
fallen entirely under his spell.</p>

<p>Reedly opened his big hand again and indicated points upon the
chart of the world. "There," he said, "and there and there, you
have the last resistances, the last possibilities of a final
offensive. This Japanese-Brazilian army here has its back to the
Andes. For that region a renewal of air action is absolutely vital.
With that we could force a capitulation in a month and then we
could concentrate all the air power on this
Levantine-Persian-Danube-Elbe complex."</p>

<p>"It's intricate."</p>

<p>"Not so intricate if I had the air."</p>

<p>"And then a general capitulation?" asked Rud.</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>"Marches into Berlin and Tokio and so forth?"</p>

<p>"Something of the sort," said Reedly.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort."</p>

<p>"But you want the war to end!"</p>

<p>"Do we?"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"We don't want a capitulation," said Rud. "I think we have that
plain. Bodisham can give you chapter and verse for that. You see,
Reedly, we don't <i>want</i> any excuse for an assembly of the old
governments on our side. On our side. The 'democratic' governments
and all that. The longer they hide in their dug-outs the better for
the New World. From our point of view the war to end war can have
no formal end. We've got controlled shipping, amalgamated air
forces, pooled finance, consolidated news-services, a common
uniform. We want to keep them common for evermore. But the day we
proclaim Victory and Peace the diplomatists and nationalists will
come creeping out of their funk-holes again with their flags and
claims and bills on each other and all that sort of thing.
Versailles all over again."</p>

<p>"I agree with that," said Bodisham. "Our revolutionary
organisation has become a world war organisation, and now it has to
develop into a world peace organisation."</p>

<p>"Even now," said Reedly, "if we fly in the face of national
feeling too openly&mdash;After all, the war isn't won yet."</p>

<p>"To all intents and purposes it is won," said Rud.</p>

<p>"In order to wind it up," said Reedly, "I want to have complete,
unqualified control of the munition supply, and I want to put an
end to this ridiculous Air Truce of Bellacourt's. Who ever heard of
such a thing? It makes the war&mdash;<i>ridiculous</i>! Every day
now we get a fleet of planes from Sweden going along the lines,
inspecting us. Did you know that? I thought you didn't. They just
fly over us and go away. Taking snapshots, I suppose. To send home
to their friends. It makes a commander-in-chief feel like a fool.
I'm like one of those Indian princes under the old British raj who
were given armies to play with and weren't allowed big guns. Then
there's this strike in America!&mdash;going right over the heads of
the government...It's fantastic. It's indecent. Here we have the
men, the workmen away there, deciding what sort of shell we may
have, what sort of guns, if any&mdash;and Roots here and Holbank
aiding and abetting them. Practically the hold-up of air-bombs is
complete. Think of that. And not a fighter left. All in cold
storage in Sweden. With a war still going on. Fantastic!"</p>

<p>"With an enemy immobilised and not daring to put a plane in the
air&mdash;even if they had the stuff to do it with," said
Bodisham.</p>

<p>"What do we know what surprises they might not spring on us? Or
what other surprises may be in store for us?"</p>

<p>"Your business to know that," said Rud.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" said Reedly.</p>

<p>Never before in his life had Steenhold heard anyone say "Pshaw!"
It amused him greatly. It went with that family portrait of a
general. Pure eighteenth-century. "How do you propose to deal with
these munition-strikers in America?" asked Rud. "If you have a free
hand there."</p>

<p>"Clap loyal troops into the factories. British and American
regulars. In the past Americans haven't been so particularly gentle
with strikers. Didn't they use to have special strikebreakers?"</p>

<p>"They've lost so many of those old freedoms," jeered
Chiffan.</p>

<p>"If they try and replace the trained workers in the explosives
factories," said Rud, "they'll have most of the factories in
fragments somewhere up in the stratosphere. Well, Reedly, you'll be
pleased to learn that both Bellacourt and Holbank are in America
now, dealing with that situation. There'll be a fleet of bombing
planes and a reasonable ration of bombs available for Europe or
Asia or anywhere quite soon."</p>

<p>"In my hands?"</p>

<p>"In Bellacourt's hands, subject to your&mdash;intimations."
Reedly was disconcerted.</p>

<p>"I can't work with Bellacourt."</p>

<p>No answer. Rud pulled a grimace.</p>

<p>"I tell you I can't work with Bellacourt."</p>

<p>Still not a word. They all stared at him.</p>

<p>"To be frank I don't trust Bellacourt. What is he after? You
don't seem to have thought about Bellacourt. Wings over the World.
Air Peace? Dreams and dangerous dreams at that. Or excuses. He's
hand and glove with Holbank and Roots. Beware of these men. Yes,
Roots, I say it. To your face. Beware of them. If only for the sake
of world security&mdash;to keep faith with our allies&mdash;we have
to hold in Bellacourt. After all we are men of honour. We are
soldiers first and foremost. The Allied War Offices appointed me.
Me and Rogers. We can't play tricks on these governments that have
trusted us."</p>

<p>Rud sat ostentatiously weighing every word of this.</p>

<p>"I think we understand Bellacourt," he said with deliberation,
"Bodisham and I and the rest of us. What we don't understand is
what <i>you</i> are after. Why do you want control of the air?
Bluntly&mdash;who is it you want to bomb, Reedly?"</p>

<p>"The situation is complex."</p>

<p>"Obviously. But who is it you want to bomb?"</p>

<p>"I don't want Bellacourt to come sailing over the Pole to Europe
on some private expedition of his own."</p>

<p>"He makes you&mdash;uncomfortable. I quite see that. But all the
same, if you get those bombers, Reedly, whom do you want to bomb?
Grossberg is beaten. His army just sticks there waiting for
something to happen...Whom do you want to bomb?"</p>

<p>"I don't want other people to be bombed. I want to have things
in my own hands."</p>

<p>"You puzzle us all," said Rud. "What, Reedly, do you really
want?"</p>

<p>"The end of the war. Peace. The restoration of
civilisation."</p>

<p>"Dear old civilisation!" whispered Chiffan. "<i>Dear</i> old
civilisation."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;yourself, Reedly?"</p>

<p>"I shall be content to have done my duty."</p>

<p>"You ought to be. You will be the last World Marshal and the
Lord of Peace. You will have done a crowning service to mankind,
for which all the world will thank you. Your statues will be
everywhere and you'll have more Avenues, Squares, railway-stations
than you'll know what to do with. Isn't that enough?"</p>

<p>"But," said Reedly, and stopped. He was not nimble in
debate.</p>

<p>"Reedly, what exactly do you want?" asked Rud, very white and
resolute. "Why did you come here? What have you got on your mind?
What have you got up your sleeve?"</p>

<p>Reedly sat squarely at the end of the table with that big, hairy
hand of his half-clenched. He glanced at his sleeve as though he
thought something might be betraying him there. "This is all very
well. I'm not a talker. I'm a plain soldier and I want to win this
war for the Democratic cause. Mixing the military and civil
commands has never been a success, and it will not be now."</p>

<p>"We live in exceptional times," said Rud.</p>

<p>"And that's my answer?" said the World Marshal.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>There was a pause. Everyone felt that a long latent issue in the
revolution had suddenly become patent.</p>

<p>Rud realised fully that he was at a crisis in his career. It had
suddenly come into his head as a bright, clear fact, that in some
manner, publicly or privately, in the interest of the new-born
World Republic, within a year at longest it would be necessary to
have Reedly shot...</p>

<p>"Now more than ever," he said, "the supreme duty of everyone in
the Group is loyal co-ordination. Everyone is answerable for his
own department and must keep complete control of his own
subordinates. Everyone must understand Reedly's plans, in general
and in particular, just as we all understand Bodisham's plans.
There must be understanding. There must be complete understanding.
The Group is one."</p>

<p>"Then I am still to be like one of those Roman Generals
with&mdash;What did they call those chaps?"</p>

<p>"Questors," said Irwell.</p>

<p>"A Questor at my elbow?&mdash;with"&mdash;he looked round the
room and added three for the absentees&mdash;"with <i>ten</i>
Questors?"</p>

<p>"It works out rather like that," said Rud.</p>

<p>"And away there in America Bellacourt gets his bombs if he wants
them and consolidates his position according to his own ideas. Has
a free hand."</p>

<p>"You underrate Bellacourt," said Rud.</p>

<p>"And in any emergency I am to be caught short of munitions and
helpless in the air!"</p>

<p>"What emergency?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell beforehand?"</p>

<p>"That is your job. To tell beforehand. Military command is
perpetual anticipation...But you know that as well as we do."</p>

<p>He looked down the table at the sulky face of the great soldier.
An impulse from his cruder, earlier days, to have the World Marshal
arrested and shot forthwith, had to be controlled. He glanced at
the placid face of Bodisham. "No hysteria," he said to himself, "no
hysteria. Keep your head, Rud." This situation had been inevitable
from the beginning.</p>

<p>"World Marshal," he said, "even if we cannot simplify your task
in the way you wish, all the same, you may rely upon all of us
being at your service, in the service of our Common World."</p>

<p>He got up, and the Group took this as a sign that the session
was over. He forced himself to walk down the room to Reedly, lay
his hand on his arm and turn him towards the maps.</p>

<p>"Tell us all," he said, "what exactly you think we ought to
do."</p>

<p>Reedly seemed disposed to resist for a moment, seemed disposed
to throw off Rud's light, nervous grip on his arm; he looked down
on Rud like an Alsatian dog being smelt by a mongrel terrier; then
he shrugged his broad shoulders and complied.</p>

<p>"I must fly back to Poland," he said, "in an hour or so.
Military necessity waits for no man. I cannot give you very long.
Let me first explain the position of Grossberg's group of
armies..."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap3_03" name="chap3_03"></a>III. &mdash; MASTERY</h2>

<h3>&sect; I</h3>

<p class="first">Rud woke out of a realistic and frightful dream.
He had dreamt he was back in his mean little room in Bloomsbury. He
had dreamt that he was lying awake in that knobby little bed, and
trying to hold himself perfectly still, because otherwise the man
in the next room might come in and beat him up. That dream instant
was as clear and vivid as the actual moment. Everything came back
to him. He had been shouting because of a terrifying vision of Lord
Horatio Bohun and his row of thumbscrews. He had shouted as he
awakened. But then the dream, after the manner of dreams, had
switched away to other preoccupations. The unseen man had suddenly
become Reedly, the World Marshal, loud and vast, bloodstained but
indestructible, determined to get at him.</p>

<p>"You thought I was dead!" said Reedly. "My sort never dies."</p>

<p>Reedly scorched and torn, unrecognisable except for his uniform
and his gaping mouth and thick moustache, and Rogers behind him,
with half his face blown away. Without any top to his head and
without eyes, with clenched hands and teeth and jawbone exposed,
Reedly was, if anything, more frightful than ever.</p>

<p>When Rud had seen them they had been lying perfectly still. They
had been as dead as rags. Not a kick left in them...</p>

<p>And here they were still in pursuit of him. Still a menace.</p>

<p>Gradually the dream dissolved, but for a time the fear still
clung to him.</p>

<p>Then slowly that passed also as he recognised the lovely
spaciousness of his bedroom. It was still sufficiently new to be a
definite pleasure. He raised himself in the bed, stuck out his feet
and rubbed his eyes. "I wish I didn't dream," he said. "There's no
sense in such dreams...Reedly has been dead two years."</p>

<p>He considered. "Almost exactly two years. Three days short of
two years."</p>

<p>His feet slid down to the smooth, cool, grey-green floor and he
stood up and stretched his arms wide.</p>

<p>"Maybe I've worked my brain too hard," he thought. "These are
tremendous times. Maybe presently I ought to have some kind of a
rest. When did I last have a rest? When have I ever had a
rest...?"</p>

<p>He stood still, summing up the situation.</p>

<p>"I've got the upper hand completely now. I've won all along the
line. Why should I be troubled? Why should I have these dreams? I
have only to go on...But all the same if I could have a rest.
Things will not leave me alone. New resistances. New difficulties.
Not so great as the old, but still they come.</p>

<p>"Never a rest. I can't leave it. Everything depends on me.
Everyone turns to me for decision."</p>

<p>He walked down the steps to his balcony and his face expressed a
certain grave satisfaction with the martyrdom he had brought upon
himself.</p>

<p>He paused under the great arch of the balcony and surveyed the
little table on which his breakfast was set out. He had no
appetite. He reflected upon the disadvantages of strenuous
greatness.</p>

<p>"There was a time," he reflected, "when I <i>loved</i> a
new-laid egg."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; II</h3>

<p class="first">But before we can assist at this sunlit breakfast
of Rud's, it will be better to relate the main events that had
converted Marshal Reedly into a nightmare horror of a frozen,
faceless shout, and installed Rud, a nervous wreck, in that
palatial sleeping place.</p>

<p>For two years Rud, sustained continually by drugs and the
excitement of the struggle, had been living without a pause. He had
been using himself to his utmost stretch. As the end of the War had
approached, it had seemed to him that the stresses of his life were
drawing to a climax. But thereafter his activities had never fallen
below the crisis level. The attainment of world mastery by the
Group had not been an end but the beginning of a far more subtle
and serious struggle, and only after a two-year crescendo of
strenuousness did there seem to be any hope whatever of relaxation
in his gigantic revolutionary effort.</p>

<p>Until the very end of the War of the Ideologies it had been in
doubt whether the Old World, so far as it was embodied in the
Allied Governments, had captured and was making use of the Group
and its World Revolution or whether the World Revolution had taken
control of them. In the end where would mastery lie? No brain in
the world had been more acutely aware of this indecisiveness than
Rud's. Day by day, long before the war was over, that ceaseless
conflict had gone on, now a point won, now a point lost, now a
phase of grip and assurance, now a phase when everything seemed
slipping away from him.</p>

<p>Reedly had not been the whole of the trouble; he had not been
the heart of the trouble; but he had been its forefront. Reedly and
his ambitions and intrigues, his romanticism and his arrogance, his
obvious good looks, melodramatically aristocratic, and his obvious
contempt for the Common Man, had become the centre and embodiment
of the old order of things that Rud was bent upon destroying. He
was World Marshal; it was manifest that he hoped to be the first
World Caesar. He played off the governments against the Group and
the Group against the governments more and more plainly. Until he
was destroyed, his destruction seemed to be the final victory for
which the Group had to fight. When he was destroyed his destruction
seemed only an incident in a far profounder conflict.</p>

<p>In the days before the outbreak of war had brought the Group
into official existence, it had carried on its propaganda against
astonishingly little resistance. It had slipped in between right
and left, with such an air of undogmatic neutrality that few people
realised that its fundamental propositions ploughed deeper than
either reactionary or "red." It had spread its ideas and phrases
about the world with scarcely any counter-attack. To the
middle-aged people who constituted the directive stratum in every
one of the combatant states, it only became apparent how very
definite and uncompromising was the Party of the Common Man and how
steadily it was setting itself to create new lines and forms of
human activity, when it was already in partial possession of the
essential services of the community. The younger officials, the
foremen and non-commissioned officer class were already, to a large
extent, explicitly or tacitly "Rudite". You never knew, nowadays,
among the younger people particlarly, the old stagers began to
remark, where those Commonsense ideas might not crop up, and how
much these younger men might not insist on disregarding orders in
pursuit of some overriding idea. "It is a phase," said the old
stagers, uneasily. "It will pass...But we had better do something
nevertheless. We don't want this sort of thing to go too far."</p>

<p>As the defeat of militant totalitarianism became more certain,
the resolve of this active and ascendant Party of the Common Man to
keep its grip on the world industries and the transport services it
had practically commandeered, and to go on disregarding the
national separatisms it had over-ridden in the name of military
necessity, became more definite and outspoken. And with that,
resistance to the Group rose.</p>

<p>The hold the Common-sense Movement had secured upon the means of
counter-propaganda varied widely in different countries, and Rud
realised with a gathering anger that a widespread series of
movements for national and racial assertion, against "deadly
uniformity", against "socialism" and the "bureaucratic control" of
financial processes, against "educational tyranny" and "the
suppression of local and individual enterprise", were putting up a
more and more effective opposition to his rapid drive towards a
permanent socialistic world organisation and administration. "After
the war," they said, "Restoration."</p>

<p>"After the war," said the Common-sense Party, "go on to the new
world."</p>

<p>A mind whose operations were becoming of increasing importance
in Rud's view of the world at that time was the slow, clear,
competent intelligence of Bellacourt. So far Rud had met few
engineers or scientific workers, and he found himself dealing with
a type of mentality less rhetorical and firmer than any he had
encountered before. Bellacourt's general trend was conservative;
his disposition was to take it for granted that a vaguely
apprehended but highly desirable civilisation was endangered by the
failure of something he called vaguely "moral progress" to keep
pace with material advance, and that this civilisation had to be
saved and reconditioned. After which he was inclined to think no
more about it and settle down to what he considered to be his own
particular job. He loved the applications of flight to exploration
and research, to the taking of food, relief, medical aid to
otherwise inaccessible places, to the spraying of crops, the
fighting of fires and suchlike humanitarian services. Civil
aviation was the very axis of his mind and he could not get away
from it.</p>

<p>The whole complex plan of a new world that Bodisham had
elaborated had to be correlated with air-necessity before
Bellacourt could be brought into militant co-operation with the
Group. Rud feared he might throw his weight on to the other side,
and consent to a premature peace settlement and another hopeless
tangle of efforts to put the world back to some imaginary former
contentment. His influence in the air forces was enormous. He was,
Rud realised, an absolutely indispensable man.</p>

<p>But educational work upon Bellacourt, that Rud and Bodisham
found heavy going, was happily for them taken out of their hands by
Reedly's eagerness to gain control of the air arm. He found it
difficult to regard a man so slight, fair and civil as Bellacourt
as in any way formidable. He spoke of him as an "ideologue", a word
he used to express the nadir of his contempt. He had picked it up
from some <i>Life</i> of Napoleon, and by it he meant a man who
believed without qualification in his own beliefs, and who was,
therefore, a difficult associate. Rud and Bodisham were a little
inclined to agree with that opinion, but they let Reedly do the
talking. Bellacourt disliked Reedly's moustaches, disliked his
overriding, short, sharp manner, his barking judgments that were
always wrong when you thought them over. He detested the noises
Reedly made coming into a room. Bellacourt was indeed the whole
machine-age ahead of Reedly. Mechanisation means lubrication. One
can hector men about but not machines, and so they mend our
manners.</p>

<p>Reedly's attempts to loosen Bellacourt's hold on the air
services of the world forced the latter towards a complete liaison
with the Common-sense Party. It was attacking institutions that
seemed to him not merely harmless but amiable; he thought its
hostility to religion and its educational aggressiveness harsh and
unnecessary; but he realised that in contrast with Reedly's
dangerous unscrupulousness it was set inflexibly upon the creation
of one common air service for the whole world. That was what he
wanted.</p>

<p>That was what Bodisham wanted. That was one of the "parallel
independent co-operations" that collectively were to make a new
world for mankind. It was typically a world service that had to be
"put out of politics". And what Rud wanted chiefly was to destroy
the old traditional institutions, the old respectabilities and
dignities and loyalties he hated, the separating distinctions and
time-honoured claims, that were now creeping out of their
hiding-places and abandoning their protective camouflages again as
the defeat of the quasi-modernised Authoritarians became more and
more assured.</p>

<p>At first the widespread resistance to World Unification had
seemed various in its nature, very human and spontaneous. At first
perhaps it was. Rud put it down for a while to the natural
perversity of his fellow Common Men. He was disposed to deal with
it piecemeal. Then as he heard Thirp's reports upon Reedly's
ever-ramifying activities and discussed the accumulating opposition
with the organising Bodisham and the shrewd, observant Chiffan, he
began to realise the increasing interrelation of these
difficulties. They were being drawn together and shaped into a
definite, new, reactionary organisation. Very rapidly now.</p>

<p>As usual his mind leapt beyond his instructors'.</p>

<p>He summoned his inner cabinet, his most trusted intimates,
Bodisham, Steenhold and Chiffan, to his room at the Aerodrome.</p>

<p>"I want to talk to you three about something urgent," he said.
"Let me explain..."</p>

<p>They did nothing to prevent him.</p>

<p>"This new movement. It's beginning to crop up, in speeches,
books, newspapers, diplomatic conversations. We have all been too
busy at our particular jobs to note it. They have a word:
'Federation!' You must have observed it...One hears more and more
of it...The way it breaks out here, there and everywhere has
puzzled me...Perhaps you don't think it amounts to much. It does.
Yesterday I was baffled by a world that looked like a scattered
jigsaw puzzle&mdash;one thing after another that wouldn't fit in
place. Then in the night I woke up."</p>

<p>"You would," said Chiffan.</p>

<p>"And it was all clear. Suddenly I saw it clear. I thought we
were just up against Reedly. I thought it would be easy to deal
with him when the time came. In fact I thought I had that provided
for. But it's something much bigger than that. It's 1918 over again
if we don't save it. The world will be cheated again. This
Federation movement is becoming a line-up of all the war-battered
conservative forces in the world. They blundered into this world
war quite on the old lines, and now they want to blunder out of it
again quite on the old lines. Instead of <i>our</i> Common World
Law we are to end in a revised patchwork of what do they call
them?&mdash;free sovereign countries, a Federal United States of
the World. Each of them still with its own little flag and money
and religion and finance and peculiar company laws and all that.
It's going to be a sort of Reformed Yesterday. An agreement against
war&mdash;some sort of treaty again&mdash;some sort of Geneva
again. With a World President (or an Emperor maybe) and a World
Senate of dodderers and a Supreme Court to bar any constructive
action. Each rotten little state still free to do what it likes
with its own common men so long as it doesn't go to war. Sweat
'em&mdash;sell 'em, Exile 'em. Like throwing snails over the garden
wall. A long time that will last! It sounds so free and
liberal&mdash;the Federation of the World. Wilson's
self-determination over again. Tennysonian and all that. Broaden
down from precedent to precedent, but remain squatting good and
tight on your particular allotment of the Common Man...I'll die a
thousand deaths before I'll stand it! I'll raise the world against
it."</p>

<p>He couldn't sit at the table. He walked about the room,
white-faced, gesticulating with clenched fists. "I see it all," he
said, "I see it all. They think they've used us and they think
they're done with us. And the hand that is drawing all the threads
together is that hairy fist of the future First World President,
the Conqueror of the Last War of All, the ultimate Julius Caesar,
<i>Judas</i> Caesar&mdash;Reedly...</p>

<p>"Who I thought was just on his own..."</p>

<p>And then in an intense voice, and as if he soliloquised, he said
something that lifted Chiffan's eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I will not have <i>my</i> Revolution assassinated," he said.
"No. I will not be tricked now. Now that I have got thus far. I
have struggled for this day&mdash;for five and twenty centuries.
Yes. I and my sort. Five and twenty centuries of it against the
bullies and the bouncers and the quiet, sly, plausible people, one
down another up. My sort of men have struggled long enough.
<i>My</i> sort of men. The pre-Ruds and the sub-Ruds, the vulgar,
ugly, slighted, cheated, resentful, free-spirited Common Men. The
Crowd. The Rebels. The Great Unwashed. Me! Do you think I haven't
been here before and do you think <i>all</i> of you haven't been
here before? In the same corner. They can kill us and bury us and
burn us up or let us rot away. Back we come again and again. Now,
<i>this</i> time, we're nearer winning than ever we were. I feel it
in my bones...</p>

<p>"Do you think the Son of Man is going to be downed by a chap who
neighs like a horse...?"</p>

<p>He stopped short and stared at Chiffan. "Sometimes you think I'm
crazy, Chiffan."</p>

<p>"Sometimes I think you're inspired."</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow," said Rud, and stood for a moment like a drugged
man. He pulled himself together. "Well, now we have it plain. Come
down to hard tacks. How can we grapple him, Bodisham? How can I set
about him? What men can we count upon? Who is with us? What sort of
men are with us?</p>

<p>"I knew he had this sort of thing in mind. That talk of his
about a United Command! That perpetual effort to get police control
away from Thirp and to edge Bellacourt out of the air. Always he
was against the embargo on bombing. He's a natural born bomber.
Bombing makes him feel like a God throwing thunderbolts. Then his
manoeuvres to go behind the Allied Munition Board and have military
instead of civil direction in the factories! His pick of officers!
His idea of contacting <i>our</i> engineers...! Yes, but what we
haven't realised up to now were all those forces scattered
throughout the world, those multitudes of reasonably able,
successful men who've 'got on,' as people say, who dread the
Economic World State like the devil, to whom this loose Federation
of Mankind they are talking about, without any world
investigations, without common financial control, without human
unity, will be reprieve, freedom, opportunity...</p>

<p>"We've got these National Dictators licked. They're all
sheltering behind their soldiers now&mdash;and their soldiers are
wondering how to dispose of them. It's like Kaiser Wilhelm in 1918.
Grossberg is <i>their</i> Reedly. Old Marshal Grossberg is no fool.
He knows where he stands. This last war is over. The situation on
the European front isn't the deadlock it pretends to be. It's a
sham fight waiting for a chosen umpire. Who won't be <i>us</i>.
Grossberg means to surrender. His army is sulking. They sit in
their dug-outs and their officers keep away from them. They've got
to that. On the east and centre, anyhow. <i>He</i> may be shot in
the back anywhen now. But he means to surrender to Reedly according
to all the laws of war, and he doesn't mean to surrender to us. We
might hand him back to his own people. We might do anything to him.
He wants to capitulate while he still has an army to surrender.
Reedly hasn't reported the state of affairs to us, because he is
hesitating. Reedly is still funking Bellacourt. And he has a nasty
feeling about Thirp and Thirp's police-net, and he feels I mean to
shoot him at the first opportunity. As I certainly do. When the
shooting begins it will have to be quick work. How are we going to
set about it?"</p>

<p>"Whom can we count upon?" asked Bodisham.</p>

<p>"We must bring in Thirp. He's developing amazingly...He's not
exactly omniscient&mdash;but he's sub-omniscient."</p>

<p>"There are enormous masses of indeterminate people just now in
the world," said Bodisham. "A push will send them in any
direction."</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?" said Rud.</p>

<p>His three familiars knew that he meant to answer that
himself.</p>

<p>"I have ideas," said Rud. "I have some ideas."</p>

<p>He dropped into his seat and began to jot down the untidy
intimations of notes on a strip of paper. He thought. He rang for
his new secretary, Olders, and gave instructions for Thirp to be
called to them at once.</p>

<p>"I <i>had</i> a sort of intimation," said Rud. "As you know,
Bellacourt has been in America twice in the last fortnight. Didn't
I tell you? He is there again. He's there with Holbank. After our
talk with him&mdash;you remember that talk, Bodisham I had a talk
to him myself. It was an afterthought. As a matter of fact, though
I didn't bother you others with it, we've done a sort of
mobilisation of the air forces. It was Bellacourt's own
suggestion&mdash;after I talked to him. We've assembled material in
Labrador ready to fly it over to Sweden, real war material, and
we've been concentrating planes in Sweden. You remember how Reedly
the other day objected to the planes flying over his blessed little
war. What he didn't realise was that they were photographic planes
and that every day for a month we've had a complete photographic
record of every movement at the front, and in one or two districts
behind. I don't think Reedly knows anything of these highly trained
young men in Stockholm with their magnifying glasses, sitting over
his little shifts of troops and transport and puzzling out what
they signify. Of course, we may have missed one or two little
things...</p>

<p>"Frankly, I expect a Reedly Putsch now within six weeks.
Bellacourt ought to be coming over Greenland now and his fighting
planes ought to be accumulating during the next fortnight. It has
to be done quietly. We don't want to frighten the birds too soon. I
want this Putsch to happen. I want Reedly to show his hand. That
will bring world affairs to one plain issue."</p>

<p>"I didn't perhaps consult you as I ought to have done," he said.
He turned to Bodisham with his notes. He was as near to being
apologetic as he could be.</p>

<p>"How do you figure this out?" he began.</p>

<p>Steenhold looked at him. He liked this. This was his Rud at his
best. It came into his head to say: "Do you remember, Rud, how you
came into my flat that Sunday morning&mdash;not so many years ago?
Just as you are now. 'This is the moment,' you said." And then it
occurred to him that this remark might be unnecessary and
inopportune, so that he did not make it.</p>

<p>Thirp appeared suddenly. "You're quick," said Rud.</p>

<p>"I have to be," said Thirp.</p>

<p>"Olders had hardly gone out of the room five minutes ago to call
you."</p>

<p>"He didn't call me. I came of my own accord. I have something
very urgent to tell you."</p>

<p>Rud took him aside.</p>

<p>"If it could be just ourselves," said Thirp. "For a moment
anyhow. I want to tell you something. It's something so
queer&mdash;I don't want to argue. Do you mind?"</p>

<p>Chiffan and Steenhold intimated that they did not mind. Bodisham
was expressionless. There was something feminine in the way that
Thirp would always scheme to get Rud to himself if he could and
have little special understandings with him, but it was a pity Rud
fell in with this. Bodisham was a philosopher. He had to take Rud
as he found him. Rud was essential to the Revolution and that was
that. Rud expected to have everything told and explained to him and
yet he was always going behind his organiser's back, with Norvel,
with Bellacourt, with Thirp&mdash;with anyone. It was his way.
Bodisham drummed with the fingers of one hand on the table and
Steenhold understood how he felt and thought.</p>

<p>Rud led Thirp to an inner room.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; III</h3>

<p class="first">"It is a very extraordinary thing," began Thirp in
his high-pitched voice after he had watched the door close. "But
you have such understanding&mdash;"</p>

<p>He twisted his long, thin hands together. "It may seem
preposterously trivial to you, but what I have to tell you about is
the despatch of twelve million coloured post cards from London, to
various destinations I have checked. They are all pictures of the
same person&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Reedly?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. I have known about these post cards for
weeks&mdash;joining them up to other little things of a similar
nature. There are some pamphlets, too&mdash;in various languages.
Well, I will confess I'm startled. I did not expect these cards to
move so soon. No. I counted on three or four weeks yet. I was
timing things for that as I explained to you. Then suddenly they
have been hustled off..."</p>

<p>"That means something has been precipitated?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. You see&mdash;I think. It's very significant."</p>

<p>"The first cat's-paw of a storm?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. These post cards are trivial in themselves, but they
are part of an elaborate scheme. If they go off, then the whole
scheme must be in motion. Nobody would give a particular order,
specially about them. Somebody or something has pressed a button. A
post card can show how the wind blows."</p>

<p>"Things are still at a standstill on the front?"</p>

<p>"N-oo. I shouldn't say that. That's exactly it. They can't be.
The unexpected must have been busy there. The front has always been
difficult to watch. Conditions vary from sector to sector. From
their left wing and all up through the Little Carpathians the
disposition to fraternise has been very strong for some time.
Bellacourt's leaflets, the ones you drafted, have done more there
than bombs. Reedly has flatly forbidden them and he has five planes
under arrest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blank mutiny."</p>

<p>"At Constance. I've just got the report of that. You know he has
always been opposed to our air propaganda. But he has never dared
touch it before. Probably he has some excuse. Things are different
on the right there, where the lines bend back above the Jura. What
we call the Italian flank. These sectors are more complicated. Old
hatreds. There is a considerable artillery activity. The men can't
get near each other, and there's Italians against our Spanish. That
ugly old feud is as bitter as ever. There's black blood there, and
also near the middle where the Czechs are up against the Germans.
Now the English and Germans have even stopped sniping...But all
that's quite secondary..."</p>

<p>"Let's look at a map."</p>

<p>The map was spread on the table.</p>

<p>"These are details. The right and its little raids and killings
is, I say, secondary. What matters is the state of affairs on the
centre and their left. There their discipline is in such a state
that their Higher Command may come trotting over to Reedly with a
white flag at any time. For all I know that may be happening now. I
told you that was possible yesterday, but I didn't realise it was
imminent. Since then something definite may have happened.
Something very definite. Reedly certainly didn't expect a snap to
come so soon. Nobody expected it so soon. <i>I</i> didn't. He's a
great commanding figure is Marshal Reedly, and when he says a thing
has to happen, that is the appointed time. Maybe it's got something
to do with the food breakdown. Maybe some quite small regimental
affair has started an avalanche. Maybe they're shooting their
officers like the Russians did in '17...Maybe they're fighting
among themselves. But you see, whatever he's been getting ready in
the way of a mine under our feet is going to be let
off&mdash;sooner than was expected&mdash;in a day or so...Or
earlier. These post cards..."</p>

<p>"You're listening in everywhere?"</p>

<p>"I could a tale unfold. But I spare you. I've got it pretty
clear; trust me. I join my slats. The idea always has been to stage
an Armistice at the front without consulting you, and to proclaim
World Federation and the end of the war straight away. And that's
what they seem to be doing now. In a rush."</p>

<p>"Reedly as Jove?"</p>

<p>"Descending upon an exhausted Europa in a cloud of post cards.
Sorry! I'm afraid I'm mixing the ladies."</p>

<p>"And he means to do&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"He will seize the aerodromes and tackle Bellacourt. And that
reminds me of another thing about this sudden precipitance.
Bellacourt, I find, has been in Canada. Has anything been going on
in Canada?"</p>

<p>"You don't know that?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't know that. How could I know it&mdash;if you didn't
tell me?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;there <i>has</i> been&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Preparation?"</p>

<p>"Bellacourt will fight Reedly&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"I wish I <i>had</i> known," said Thirp, and wished silently
that sometimes Rud would let his left hand know what his right was
doing. "I wish I had known," he repeated.</p>

<p>"Reedly must have heard of that," he went on. "Before I did.
That may have touched everything off. But anyhow, he is against
Bellacourt. He hates Bellacourt if possible more than he hates you.
He's a <i>vain</i> man. These last months, without any real air
fighting and the command of the air in our hands, have made him
feel ridiculous. I think I can give a rough guess of what he will
do. In one little communication that I happened to hear he
said&mdash;what was it?&mdash;<i>prig-ridden air</i>. He'd go
straight for the aerodromes and try and recover them from the
Allied Air Control, that is to say, Bellacourt. He will seize some
of the big power-stations. I've been trying to get all that
unobtrustively policed&mdash;by trustworthy people. He will
naturally denounce you for wanting to prolong the war by holding
back the air arm. Hey Presto! Civilisation has been saved in the
nick of time. We shall figure&mdash;as Reds, as World Communists,
enemies of religion, enemies of patriotism. All our hard-won
respectability gone! Most of us will be arrested."</p>

<p>"He's got all this ready?"</p>

<p>"He's got it <i>half</i> ready. In one way or another I've
wetted a lot of his powder. Some sort of attack was actually
brewing here, there's some army die-hards professedly on leave in
Amsterdam. Maybe they meant to raid us here. But I've scotched that
for the moment, I think, by bringing in about a
thousand&mdash;nearly a thousand&mdash;of my own youngsters. From
London...Well, anyhow, they'll be here this afternoon. He's had
about three divisions in reserve in Flanders ready to be clapped
into trains and rushed here by the end of next week. That I know.
Munitions not arrived for them. He's a <i>bad</i> organiser. Roots
has held that up, We've got all that taped. They're stirring now,
but they can't get moving&mdash;at least only a few companies might
be rushed...With no guns...I'll have the trains held up. I think I
can do that. My men will be here in three hours at latest. Nothing
much can happen until then."</p>

<p>His confidence had a slightly forced quality.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Thirp, "in a place like Amsterdam...One can't
answer for everything&mdash;There's always been a strong
reactionary movement..."</p>

<p>Rud stood brooding over the map.</p>

<p>"This place might be quite a lively spot in no time," he
said.</p>

<p>Olders burst in with a paper in his hand and handed it to Rud.
Rud read it silently and then aloud: "Enemy army in open mutiny.
Discipline gone. Higher Command and officers ask to surrender to
us. They are in great danger. Have ordered Cease Fire and am
arranging surrender and armistice. Propose to proclaim World Peace
forthwith based on self-determination."</p>

<p>"D'you hear that?" said Rud. "Based on self-determination."</p>

<p>"Only conditions generally acceptable. Trust you and Bellacourt
will co-operate..."</p>

<p>"We were prophetic," said Rud.</p>

<p>"And now?"</p>

<p>"Either I shoot Reedly or he shoots me within the next
twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"My lads from London will be here," said Thirp; "it can't take
them three hours. I don't see how I can possibly accelerate
them...Frankly I would if I could. Tell me about Bellacourt. How
does he stand? Can these planes from America be brought here? In
time?..."</p>

<p>Rud answered none of Thirp's questions. Instead, he went on
extracting particulars of the situation in Amsterdam.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; IV</h3>

<p class="first">Steenhold sat in his place at the council table.
He looked sullenly amused. He was reflecting upon the change in his
relation to Rud. He had wanted to make a friendly remark to him and
he had not made it&mdash;out of deference! He was surprised at
himself and everything.</p>

<p>There had been a time, not so many years ago, when he had been a
sort of patron-philosopher to Rud, when he had disputed with him,
quarrelled with him, said anything he liked to him. And paid the
bills. Now one waited to be told. This revolutionary business had
become real, very real. When he had played at World Revolution in
Camborne Square, reality had seemed a hundred worlds away. And yet,
had it not been for his helpful money in those early days...</p>

<p>The door of the little room opened and Rud, an exalted Rud,
appeared. His scowl was at its most masterful and vicious and his
mouth was tight drawn in at its left corner, with resolution.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said. "Everything has to be short and quick. The
moment is nearer than we thought."</p>

<p>Bodisham turned an attentive face, saying nothing.</p>

<p>"Olders," said Rud, "radio Bellacourt G.G.G. and then wait ten
minutes, then repeat and go on until you have the code answer."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" said Chiffan.</p>

<p>"He'll know."</p>

<p>"H'm," said Chiffan, and his eye met Steenhold's for a
moment.</p>

<p>Rud advanced to the table and spoke, standing.</p>

<p>"Reedly's lost his nerve," he said. "He's put his Putsch
on&mdash;a month perhaps. And here we are. He means to strike. He's
got a trainload of French troops coming here from Antwerp, but that
may get switched on to the frontier. Evidently he means to grab
this place and us. That's for the transport section, Steenhold.
What can you do? Thirp doesn't know exactly what he has in the
town&mdash;but I doubt if it's ready. He's got no
guns&mdash;anywhere. Neither at Antwerp nor in Amsterdam. Thirp
thinks he has some of the groundsmen here...That's the situation.
There's no doubt he's moving now. We may have a raid here at any
time. But we've got those planes out there? He may have stuff for
the four or five he has at Constance. You'd better pack up,
Bodisham&mdash;in case...We'll keep one plane for you...But that's
by the way...</p>

<p>"First of all, the situation here. I want you, Steenhold, to
take charge of all this. The police here don't number four hundred,
there's only a youngster in command&mdash;we don't know anything
about him&mdash;and Thirp will hand over the command to you. You
must have got a section of your transport corps at Rotterdam and
some at the port here. They're scattered, I suppose. Can you get
them together? We want the aerodrome and the radio station
held&mdash;and all this. Dreed had better go to the radio station
forthwith. You'll assist him to improvise a defence. It's very
important to keep the radio going. Steenhold&mdash;if you will go
with Thirp to the door&mdash;your second in command is outside.
Thirp and Olders and I are going to vanish. You'll hear from us
soon enough."</p>

<p>He went and sat down beside Bodisham and began to talk to him
rapidly in undertones. Bodisham nodded quickly and approvingly.</p>

<p>Steenhold felt anxious. Where was Rud going? Oughtn't there to
be some sort of council of war?</p>

<p>"I don't understand," he began.</p>

<p>"Steenhold," said Rud, "you've got your orders. Things can't
wait for explanations now. You must do something about those French
troops from Antwerp. They have to be held up. There's not much time
if they are really entrained. Does the line come through Rotterdam?
I don't know."</p>

<p>"Gee!" said Steenhold, blew, and then got up and saluted. He had
never saluted Rud before.</p>

<p>Rud went on talking to Bodisham.</p>

<p>"That's Rud. That was," said Steenhold as he left the room with
Thirp.</p>

<p>They found a bright young officer of police outside, who
saluted. Thirp led the way to the ground floor where there was a
large-scale map of the aerodrome and its surroundings. "Show the
Minister where your men are," he said.</p>

<p>"Is there a siren or anything handy," said Steenhold, taking
hold of the situation, "to call the men to quarters?"</p>

<p>The first intimation that Reedly's Federalist friends in
Amsterdam had of trouble afoot was the siren at the Aerodrome.
Thirp's secret police were already in possession of the Antwerp
telephone exchange and were intercepting Reedly's calls to action
and taking down the names.</p>

<p>Most of them were caught unawares. But not all.</p>

<p>"This is a damned great place to hold with only four hundred
people," said Steenhold, standing on the steps of the main building
and surveying his area of responsibility. In the afternoon sunshine
it looked tranquil almost to drowsiness. "I wonder what one ought
to treat as vital points and just where the trouble will come from
and what shape it will take."</p>

<p>Steenhold had a lively but receptive mind, he had never been a
man of action. He did not feel like a man of action now. He had
always looked on at life, egged people on, enjoyed the results of
their initiatives. Rud had been his great discovery, his staple
entertainment. Now suddenly, an hour after lunch, he found himself
with a recalcitrant bunch of disconnected responsibilities thrust
into his hands and no one to observe but himself. Hold this place?
Hold it how? Hold it against what? Away there by the air station
were half a dozen planes lined up and a small one some way off in
the corner of the field. These, he supposed, would have to be
guarded&mdash;the pilots were probably standing by and they would
be Bellacourt's men, but there ought to be some police to support
them. Rud had said something about disloyal groundsmen. The
machines had to be protected from sabotage, A man with a bomb might
play havoc there. Then half-hidden by the main building was Dreed's
radio station. Dreed would be warned and would see to the defence
of that, but he ought to be reinforced.</p>

<p>"Three essential points," Steenhold told himself, "headquarters,
the planes and the radio. No way of consolidating a central
position that I can see. But think&mdash;where will the attack
come? First there are those French troops from Antwerp. If they
come discreetly with pilot engines ahead and a revolver at the ear
of every engine-driver, it won't be so easy to switch them out of
action. But coming discreetly means coming slowly. They'll come
along the line and detrain where it is most convenient. Can they
afford the time to come discreetly? They'll have to rush. If they
rush, they must rush into trouble."</p>

<p>"How near is the railway?" he asked, and then had a bright idea.
Even if he couldn't switch those French troops off to some remote
destination, as he had imagined at first, he could get a dozen
engines or more if necessary from Amsterdam, put them on the line,
and simply smash up that troop train as it came up. Before they had
time to detrain. He must see to that in a minute, as soon as he was
clear about everything else.</p>

<p>Something else? There might be some sort of attack in unknown
force from the town. That would come by road in cars. It might come
first. It might wait for the arrival of the French. It might not
come at all. Nothing might come. He ticked off the items on the
fingers of his open hand. Then he asked his second in command how
many men he had.</p>

<p>"Seventy-six on duty. The rest are falling in over there by the
hutments. About two-hundred-and-ninety-odd."</p>

<p>"Good," said Steenhold. "We join them."</p>

<p>And as they walked across the Aerodrome he arranged for a squad
of men under a competent sergeant to go towards the town, hold up
any cars and wire the road, while another squad was to reinforce
the radio guard, if there was a radio guard, and put itself at the
disposal of Dreed. The road party paraded, six men went off to get
wire from the stores and the rest marched briskly towards the
Amsterdam road in the most business-like way. Steenhold ordered a
dozen men to strengthen the force in the main building and
stationed the remainder of a hundred and twenty men in front of the
main building as a reserve force that could be turned in any
direction to meet whatever trouble might arise. He went through the
motions of an inspection of their arms. "We've just got to prevent
any disturbance," he told the young officer. Then he went to the
planes to assure himself that the pilots and mechanics were on the
alert.</p>

<p>He did all this methodically, watchful of his second in command
and the two orderlies they had annexed, to see from their behaviour
whether he seemed to be doing things right. They seemed to think he
was doing things right.</p>

<p>The pilots seemed satisfied with themselves and anxious to learn
what was expected of them. He told them to be ready to go up at any
moment and they said "Aye, aye, sir," very reassuringly. Within he
felt that faint stirring of derision for the whole business of life
which is the salt of the American mentality. Outwardly they are
sentimental and enthusiastic and inwardly they are profoundly
cynical. All over the world for generations, he reflected, this
solemn sort of preparatory business has been going on; commanding
officers, with an air of conviction, making their dispositions,
sentries being put, passwords fixed, challenges arranged, all the
stiffly silly formalities of warfare, everyone being as wooden and
regulation-ruled as possible, and the officer never quite sure of
himself and carrying it off with an air.</p>

<p>Americans generally have never loved this saluting,
uniform-wearing business. They over-did it when they had a chance,
because fundamentally they could not believe in it. Probably it was
necessary. Probably you could only keep the thing going with all
this routine. But what a quantity of fuss, of saluting,
heel-clicking, running about, before ever you begin to have
anything real happening!</p>

<p>It was just the same with religion. Setting about things, that,
in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, took you nowhere and did
nothing that mattered, with the gravest of faces. Being stern,
sharp, emphatic&mdash;violent if necessary. Before it was
necessary. "'Shun!"</p>

<p>"As you were!"</p>

<p>"On the knee!" Why did every human concern clog itself up in a
tangle of routines, formalities, disciplines, imperatives? Why
couldn't one be free? Really free? Guarding one's freedom, wasn't
freedom at all. Why couldn't one win one's freedom for good and
all, and get on with life?</p>

<p>He wished he knew more of the situation. Had Reedly got hold of
some planes? If so, would they appear presently? Where was
Bellacourt? What had Bellacourt got away there in Sweden? Was
Bellacourt playing some game of his own? Why didn't we have our own
planes in the air here? When the war began there had been tens of
thousands of planes fighting in the air, and then as the enemy had
their factories and aerodromes destroyed and their planes beaten
out of the sky, there had been this air cessation. Possibly
Bellacourt's air strikes had not been altogether unwelcome to the
over-strained governments of the Democratic Allies. It had given
them an excuse for relaxing their exhausting efforts to produce
material and for bringing back the war from three dimensions to
two. Yet it was curious we had not made one crowning effort to end
the war? Our planes, such as remained, went about looking at things
and doing nothing, and the war, which had begun in an uproar of
destruction, was dying of inanition. Was there some catch in the
business and was it true that the air arm cannot end a war?</p>

<p>Anyhow here we were, it seemed, with war back on the ground
again, and Reedly trying to play Napoleon to our revolution, quite
in the best tradition...</p>

<p>Steenhold wrenched his mind away from these questions and gave
himself up to the railway problem. He spent an active and useful
half-hour with a very competent subordinate and then he emerged
upon the air-field again.</p>

<p>"And now what is there to be done?" he asked the officer.</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir, that I can see, until something happens." The
young officer seemed to think that everything was going according
to plan in this best of all possible worlds...</p>

<p>Wouldn't do to ask him what he thought <i>would</i>
happen...</p>

<p>Then suddenly the central part of the main building became
active. One of Bellacourt's men with a megaphone appeared on a
little balcony high up and began giving orders to the pilots. They
became exceedingly active and a truck of petrol appeared out of an
archway below. Three of the men went off at a run to the smaller
plane. Two more pilots on bicycles shot round the wing of the main
buildings and joined them.</p>

<p>It looked all right.</p>

<p>Then Rud and Thirp and Olders appeared upon the steps of the
main building, in the company of two airmen. The planes, one after
another, began to tune up. Their propellers leapt to activity with
a happy shudder.</p>

<p>Something was happening now. The drowsy afternoon woke up. But
what <i>was</i> happening?</p>

<p>They were going off somewhere and he did not know where they
were going. He felt like a little boy who for some inscrutable
reason has not been asked to a party. Where were they going? To
Reedly? Perhaps Rud had been talking to Reedly and something had
been patched up. Or to Sweden where perhaps Bellacourt was in
control of things? Or in flight before Reedly struck?</p>

<p>"Why can't I know?" asked Steenhold, with a feeling like tears
of vexation in his eyes. "He might have told me. I stood by him in
the old days..."</p>

<p>A sound as though someone had snapped a brittle metallic rod and
a shiver in the air.</p>

<p>Then a shout from among the planes and revolver shots. Three or
four men were moving about very quickly there.</p>

<p>Rud was holding up his hand as if to forbid some action.
Sabotage among the planes? Steenhold ran towards the scuffle,
pulling out his revolver as he ran, and signalling to the knot of
world police who were standing or sitting in front of the main
building. There was no further shooting, and two of the pilots
seemed to be holding a man, the man, no doubt, who had fired the
shot at Rud. A man in pilot's uniform dodged round the head of the
nearest machine, and he had something in either hand like a cricket
ball. He threw one of these objects under the plane, and seemed to
hesitate about the other. Steenhold was running at an angle to the
disturbance so that he alone saw this man clearly. He was evidently
unobserved by either the spray of police who were running towards
the plane or by the men actually about the machines. Steenhold
shouted to confuse his attention and fired his revolver. A pilot's
face appeared in the cabin of the machine.</p>

<p>The bomb under the machine burst loudly and the machine came
tilting over towards Steenhold in a deliberate, drunken fashion as
if to meet and welcome him. The pilot behind the glass seemed an
inactive, an indifferent spectator of these events. The spinning
propeller caught the bomb-thrower's head as he turned and stepped
back to confront Steenhold, and the bomb he held dropped from his
hand and rolled and burst six yards in front of Steenhold's
feet.</p>

<p>Steenhold had an extraordinary sense of being struck back and
front at once, as though vast aerial hands clapped themselves upon
him, and that he had lost his balance as he had never lost his
balance before. His feet were off the ground. The plane, with its
propeller whirling up the red-brown trophy it had slashed from his
scalped antagonist, waved and sank down out of sight and he was
staring at the sky...</p>

<p>Everything which had been moving with incredible rapidity now
moved with unprecedented deliberation. It was clear to him that Rud
had to go somewhere and that he had to prevent any interference
with Rud. But nobody was telling him anything. Nobody ever told him
anything nowadays. In the past it had been different.</p>

<p>Some sort of mental blank ensued.</p>

<p>He was doing something for Rud.</p>

<p>Had they got Rud? Had he got away? Where was he going?</p>

<p>It was a nuisance to have been hit so that he had to lie flat on
his back like this. He dragged a hand across his chest and it was
wet. He raised a hand, which had suddenly become very heavy, and it
was bright red. He couldn't be badly hurt because there was not the
slightest pain. But this blood! There seemed a frightful lot of it.
And the taste of blood in his mouth. Where did it all come from?
You couldn't possibly go on bleeding like this...</p>

<p>Somebody was saying: "You hurt much?" Somebody with a face
upside-down looking at him. "You hurt much?" Bloody fool!</p>

<p>His chest blown in? Some of it anyhow. Mortally wounded? There
ought to be a breast bone somewhere if one could raise a hand to
feel it. But his hand had gone dead now.</p>

<p>It couldn't be! Presently perhaps, but not now. Not in the very
middle of a scrap. Pinned to the ground like this. He'd get up in a
minute.</p>

<p>But he knew better. He felt a wave of childish frustration.</p>

<p>He spoke, almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>"Not to see the <i>end</i> of it! That's <i>too</i> bad..."</p>

<p>They were Steenhold's last words. He felt as though he was being
diluted very rapidly. Numbness radiated from his chest in waves. He
had a dim idea that he was straining his neck up to look for Rud,
but there was no Rud, only blue sky and little white clouds sailing
in two columns ahead, V-wise, across the sky, and then that last
faint impression faded.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; V</h3>

<p class="first">Oblivious of the death of his first substantial
supporter, oblivious indeed of everything but the urgency of his
conclusive grapple with Reedly, Rud paced the air photography rooms
at Stockholm which were Bellacourt's Headquarters.</p>

<p>Bellacourt was already over Norway on his way to them. He
couldn't be more than ten minutes away.</p>

<p>Thirp sat crouched and angular with his arms folded, waiting an
hour to the minute so to speak; Olders subdued himself to patience
by staring out of the windows. They had all come in the smaller,
swifter machine from Amsterdam. They had not waited even to learn
what had happened to the bombed machine. The others, they knew,
were scouting southwards towards Antwerp&mdash;except the one that
would wait for Bodisham if Bodisham had to bolt.</p>

<p>These Sloten machines carried no bombs or guns, but they were to
report any movement of troops to Dreed and Steenhold. Rud had
refused to hear any reports from them. He wanted to concentrate
upon Reedly. All the rest was detail and it was becoming his habit
now to leave detail to others. He paced the long room of the air
maps, not looking at them, brooding on what was before him and
whistling in his incompetent, small-boy way between his teeth. And
presently Bellacourt arrived.</p>

<p>He came straight to Rud, still wearing his wadded coat, and he
stripped it off as he greeted Rud.</p>

<p>"I got your radio," he said. "What has happened?"</p>

<p>"Everything&mdash;suddenly. A full month before our calculation.
I was right about the facts as I told you them when last we talked.
Where are the bombs and the bombers?"</p>

<p>"Twenty close now. Following me. Not half an hour behind. Twenty
more from Reykjavik. Fifty in reserve, starting from Battle Harbour
in an hour. In all this I'm guided by you."</p>

<p>"Then we can be in Poland with that load&mdash;your
twenty&mdash;when?"</p>

<p>"Well before sundown."</p>

<p>"You have plenty of other planes here but no bombs for
them?"</p>

<p>"Several hundred without bombs."</p>

<p>"We could take men in those?"</p>

<p>Thirp intervened. "I've got a detachment of my men here who've
been trained for that. They can drop. Mostly they're Russians.
Lovely youngsters. I just took them over. They've always been good
at the parachute game."</p>

<p>"Good," said Rud. "Now the next thing is to locate Mr. Reedly
exactly."</p>

<p>"We've got all the positions in Poland photographed from a
thousand feet," said Bellacourt. "I haven't worked with Crawford
for nothing. We've been doing that for weeks now. I doubt if Reedly
understands that. If you'll come into the Long Gallery, where the
boys are working, I can show you&mdash;his G.H.Q. and everything.
Fresh and nearly up to date."</p>

<p>"Bellacourt, you hate bombing, I know," said Rud, "but this time
you will bomb in a good cause. Just let me tell exactly why we have
to blow the World Marshal to bits, now."</p>

<p>And as they went towards the Long Gallery, where Bellacourt's
photograph readers were working at their daily examination of
Reedly's movements, Rud, with elucidatory remarks from Thirp,
explained the urgency of the situation to Bellacourt.</p>

<p>Bellacourt led the way to the long table devoted to the
photographic examinations. There, arranged for comparison, were the
long strips for yesterday and the day before and the day before
that. An assistant stood by with lenses while Bellacourt explained
the reading of the photographs. "There's his dug-out. Pretty big
and deep. That heap of earth came out of it. It casts quite a
shadow, you see. That's the shadow, that black mark. That gives us
the height of the heap. There's the Officer's Mess. There are the
kitchens. You see the tracks made by the orderlies going to and
fro? Those pale streaks. Pretty work reading these photographs! You
see that shadow there; that's cast by the photographer's own plane.
Its size and its distortion gives its height and the angular
measure for all the other shadows."</p>

<p>"You could bomb all that&mdash;this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"I can blow it to rags&mdash;all this area&mdash;before sundown
to-night. We've got quite enough stuff for that. But how can we be
sure he will be there&mdash;and not somewhere else, or down in that
dug-out? Impossible to get him if he's in the dug-out."</p>

<p>"He'll be there all right," said Rud. "I'll arrange that with
him."</p>

<p>Olders was called away for a moment to take a radio message.</p>

<p>"You'll <i>arrange</i> it&mdash;with <i>him!</i>" said
Bellacourt, puzzled.</p>

<p>"With him&mdash;by telephone. Why not?"</p>

<p>"You mean he'll <i>tell</i> you&mdash;himself! Where to bomb
him?"</p>

<p>"He'll tell me all right and then we shoot. This is a very
simultaneous world. You can't shoot a man unless you know where he
is, can you? But if you know exactly where he is you can shoot him
half-way round the world."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Perfectly simple," said Rud. "I've been talking to him
already&mdash;from Sloten. And when we are clear about these
maps...You might bring a strip of that with you while I telephone
again."</p>

<p>Olders came with a message. "I think you might know we've just
got this: 'Troop train from Antwerp derailed near Dordrecht. No
further trouble here. Wilson.'"</p>

<p>"Who's <i>Wilson</i>?" asked Rud. "I wonder why Steenhold didn't
sign that. He ought to have signed it."</p>

<p>He wondered only momentarily. Then he turned his mind to the
business in hand again.</p>

<p>They went to the room with the radio apparatus and Thirp sat
down to get the World Marshal. When he did he handed the instrument
to Rud. Bellacourt sat beside him with the air photograph of
Reedly's Headquarters on the table.</p>

<p>"That you, World Marshal?" said Rud.</p>

<p>"Quite all right."</p>

<p>"No, nothing has happened. What did you expect to happen? I have
been thinking over our last talk. I still think you may be too
precipitate...Of course if Grossberg has surrendered, you must
treat him decently. But what about his army? What state are they
in?..."</p>

<p>Lengthy reply. Thirp listened to anything he could catch and Rud
winked at him suddenly.</p>

<p>"But don't you think that before you communicate with the Allied
Governments, you ought to come to Sloten again and consult us?
After all, you <i>are</i> a member of the Group. Or aren't
you?...</p>

<p>"You have a double responsibility you say. Even then you ought
to keep in touch with us. You could be in Sloten before
sundown...</p>

<p>"You have Grossberg and his staff on your
hands...Naturally&mdash;every courtesy...Yes, yes, as one soldier
to another and all that. Naturally you'll dine with him. We
civilians are apt to forget that professional brotherliness. Would
you like me to join you?...</p>

<p>"To-morrow more convenient. And you will be entertaining the
defeated this evening. I should be in the way. Yes? Seven, I
suppose. About then?"</p>

<p>Rud gestured noiselessly and triumphantly to Bellacourt and
Bellacourt stuck a pin in the Officers' Mess. "Can I ring you up
later? You'll be at the Officers' Mess, if I want to get
you...After seven for certain. Wait a moment...</p>

<p>"You don't think there's much more to say? Maybe you are right.
But I warn you the Group may feel a little out of it if you insist
on carrying on negotiations without them...</p>

<p>"Bellacourt? I <i>told</i> you he was in America. Getting
munitions specially for you...</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll settle something, trust me. Maybe the Group has
overrated itself...You think so. I've always been a bit afraid of
you, Reedly. I've always felt you had that idea of us...Still,
things are in your hands. You have said it. <i>Bon
appetit</i>."</p>

<p>He put down the instrument. "That's that," he said. "Wonderful,"
said Thirp. "He's fixed. I can't help feeling&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Feel it later," said Rud. "Now what exactly do we mean to
do?"</p>

<p>Bellacourt began: "I get my planes refuelled and inspected."</p>

<p>"What we do," said Rud, "is this. You, Bellacourt, I take it, go
high with those twenty bombers of yours, high, high, high&mdash;out
of sight in the blue&mdash;until you are just out of hearing of
him. About here say."</p>

<p>Bellacourt made a rapid calculation and indicated a spot with
his pencil. "Twenty thousand feet," he said.</p>

<p>"You will be leading. Your men will have copies of these air
maps. Well, as many as there are copies. Possibly not if you think
it unnecessary. The light will be good for two hours yet. Then you
stop your engines and down you come. Without a sound. Down, down,
and then flatten out and let out the engines. They'll hardly hear
your engines before you are on them. Then&mdash;all this
area&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Goes to smithereens," said Bellacourt. "You can count on it.
It's disgusting work. We shall be beautifully accurate&mdash;as we
shall do it&mdash;trust me&mdash;but none the less it's disgusting.
This makes ordinary assassination a gallant enterprise. You know I
admire the way you've fixed him, but by God I don't like it...Ah
well, perhaps I'm a bit finicky. I'll try and think I'm getting
square with those damned Germans at Guernica. You know, I saw all
that...I did."</p>

<p>"Meanwhile," said Rud, "Thirp and I go over the enemy lines in
that modest little plane we came in and drop down in these flats
here."</p>

<p>"Olders and you," said Thirp. "I had better stay here for a bit
and then go back to Sloten."</p>

<p>"You think?" said Rud.</p>

<p>"Sure," said Thirp.</p>

<p>Rud turned to Bellacourt. "You're sure we can make a good
landing there?"</p>

<p>"It's been used as an airfield," said Bellacourt. "You can see
the tracks. Look. With the lens."</p>

<p>"We land there then," said Rud. "While your Russian boys, Thirp,
in their parachutes, are already drifting and falling like
thistledown over all this bit, each with his little gun and his
ribbon of ammunition."</p>

<p>"I wish I could come," said Thirp.</p>

<p>"You expect to find mutineers there?" asked Bellacourt.</p>

<p>"I expect you'll find a Soldiers' and Workers' Committee," said
Thirp. "Talking mostly."</p>

<p>"Is that what they call it?" said Rud. "Soldiers' and Workers'
Committee! Delightful! It's 1917 over again. But this time the
sequel will be different. We are the Revolution from the West and
all fast-colour Revolutions come out of the West."</p>

<p>"Suppose they shoot you as you come down?"</p>

<p>"No guarantee they won't. Then it will be all up with our Common
World and nothing else will matter to us. I wish I talked better
German. But they will have heard of me."</p>

<p>"Suppose they take pot shots at our parachutists?"</p>

<p>"Most of them will be gaping at Reedly's Headquarters, over the
way. They won't shoot unless they're shot at. They won't know who
we are."</p>

<p>"And the Allied Army?"</p>

<p>"Stunned. And then fraternisation..."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VI</h3>

<p class="first">The World Marshal spoke in Anglo-German out of
compliment to his distinguished guests and prisoners.</p>

<p>He hated talk when he encountered the loose, unaccountable minds
of the intelligentsia; you never knew what they meant by it all;
that brought out all the strong and silent stuff in him; but when
it came to talking to soldiers and gentlemen, who used exactly the
same phrases and metaphors, had identically amorphous ideas and
could understand him perfectly, he could be fairly eloquent.</p>

<p>He was now in a state of sombre exaltation. At last it was his
Day. He had told himself quite a number of times that afternoon
that he had crossed the Rubicon. Except for a faint uneasiness
about the possible recalcitrance of that crazy pacifist Bellacourt,
there was not a shadow that he could see upon the road to world
dominion that opened wide before him. He was grasping control of a
disordered world on the very verge of social dissolution. He felt
like General Monk, who had been one of his boyhood's heroes. He
felt still more like Bonaparte after that whiff of grapeshot had
put an end to the revolutionary vagaries of Paris. He, too, in his
turn was saving civilisation&mdash;and civilisation&mdash;he would
see to it&mdash;was going to be jolly grateful to him.</p>

<p>Just before he rose to speak he talked about Rud and the Group
to the officers about him.</p>

<p>"Every sign of the completest collapse of that Common Man
Movement. Every sign. They feel Destiny closing in on them. They
realise they are out-witted and out-manoeuvred...Yes, I've good
evidence of that&mdash;the best of evidence. Listen to something I
have to tell you. I never believed in this man Rud Whitlow, though
for a time it has served our purpose to have dealings with him.
Anyhow, now I can wash my hands of him. Queer fish! Born
double-crosser. Now he wants to go back on his associates. They'll
all try that. They'll all be coming in now, ears down and tails
wagging. It's in the breed. Twice he has been talking to me to-day
on the air, trying to get to some sort of terms with me. Would you
believe it?...Oh, I humour him. What is the use of his talking now?
He's a doomed man. What use can they be in the world now? Short and
sharp&mdash;against the wall. Eh?"</p>

<p>He nodded. His hearers nodded appreciatively. Then after a brief
interval he stood up to make his speech, a manly man-to-man speech,
but in its way, brilliant.</p>

<p>He said he did not want to make a speech, he never wanted to
make speeches, he was not the talking sort, but he felt he could
not let this occasion go by without a word of cheer, of fraternal
greeting, as one soldier to another, for the great Christian
gentleman, that clean, honest fighter, their enemy and
brother-in-arms, Marshal Grossberg.</p>

<p>"We know only too well, to our cost, some of us, what a stout
and sturdy warrior he can be, and on our side too we understand
what it must mean to be stabbed in the back by those who owed, for
every reason, high or low, loyal cooperation. None of our backs
here have been perfectly safe. From the soldier's point of view,
and as far as soldiers, real soldiers, go, this has been an honest,
straightforward war. Modern weapons, but the old spirit. Alas! it
can never be fought to a finish now, because never at any time has
it been possible to keep out the enterprises&mdash;the
interferences of shall we call them outsiders? Shall I speak more
plainly?"</p>

<p>He paused and warmed up&mdash;"The filthy activities of
cosmopolitan rogues, the incessant interference of ambiguous
civilians, men who boast of their treason, men without faith or
flag." (Sounds of agreement.)</p>

<p>"We soldiers, Marshal Grossberg, have had neither hand nor part
in this foul propaganda that has undermined your discipline and
turned every other man in your ranks into&mdash;what shall I
say?&mdash;the perplexed tool of the forces of malarial&mdash;of
malignant disorder." (Applause at the phrasing.) "Even our
espionage system has been honest, Marshal, here at the front, a
soldierly espionage of fact, not a burrowing under the very roots
of human life. This has been a great war and a fine war, but now we
realise that there are issues profounder than any immediate war
aims. The whole social order, Christianity,
chivalry&mdash;Christianity here and chivalry in the Far
East&mdash;honour, obedience, property, the purity of women, the
discharge of obligations, plain honesty, love of country, the breed
of horses, clean sport, everything that makes the orderly
succession of seed-time and harvest, peace and war, is at stake.
The sword, that clean white symbol of disciplined force, has been
ousted by the ink squirt, by the creeping activities of mental
germs viler than any physical corruption&mdash;viler than any
disease germ, any poisoning of the wells." (Hear, hear.) "While we
fight here at the front, humanity behind us crumbles down to a
diseased dementia." (Sounds of approval.) "The first duty of a
soldier is and always has been not to make war&mdash;no&mdash;but
to keep the peace and to keep it with a strong hand. War is the
soldier's exercise, his natural purification, but it is not his
primary function. His primary function is discipline. And now we
soldiers under all our flags have to stand shoulder to shoulder in
the name of discipline&mdash;of disciplined democracy, strong and
silent. I give you The Soldiers' Peace, the mastery of the sword,
obedience and preparedness. An end, gentlemen, an end to this
cosmopolitan folly..."</p>

<p>Something seemed to happen to his voice. It was as if he no
longer had a voice. Something had engulfed it.</p>

<p>"What's <i>that?</i>" cried Grossberg inaudibly, staring with
sudden apprehension out of the window.</p>

<p>The World Marshal's voice had been drowned by a great roar of
aeroplanes, an eruption of huge, ugly, undulating, hungry sound,
and he, too, turned to see the black bulk of the leading bomber
sweeping over the Mess. It did not seem to be coming out of the
sky, it had skimmed so low as it opened out that it seemed now to
be rising out of the ground. It rushed up out from beneath the edge
of the glowing sunset, a swift, expanding blackness. It was like a
gigantic black skate in an aquarium swimming towards him very
swiftly. It just cleared the nearer barracks and it had already
risen sharply up out of the field of his vision, when the two bombs
it had delivered, burst.</p>

<p>Hard upon it roared its fellows, rising right and left behind it
and blotting out the sky in their turn. Beyond came
others...Everything seemed to burst as the bombs burst. The corner
of the window flew in towards the World Marshal. It flew at him,
attacking him; a great knife of glass...It was coming straight for
his moustache.</p>

<p>That was his last impression of life. He felt nothing more. The
glass cut through his face like a knife thrown at a meringue. He
was extinguished.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VII</h3>

<p class="first">The airfield behind the front lines of the
Authoritarian Army was already deserted, and the shell-torn area
beyond seemed equally abandoned, except for the World Police who
were dropping down out of the air, making their more or less
dexterous landings, and coming together into little groups. Farther
to the north-west and slanting away westward lay the broken country
of the trenches and a couple of ruined villages, and still remoter,
flame-shot masses of smoke rose from the Allied Headquarters
against a clear golden sunset.</p>

<p>The bombing planes had zoomed up overhead and vanished in the
eastward sky. They swept round in a great curve and went straight
back to Stockholm, leaving everything to Rud. Bellacourt knew he
could not stomach the sight of his handiwork. The thought of
Guernica proved to be no consolation to him. But from Stockholm he
sent on his planes from America as they came to hand, and put them
at the service of the World Police. They spiralled down out of the
twilight and dropped more and more parachutists.</p>

<p>Rud and Olders advanced across that war-torn landscape, and as
they did so, the descending men of the World Police converged upon
them and fell in as a sort of guard. A rabble of soldiers joined
them. A huge cat bolted out of a shell-hole, and then another. "The
cats eat the rats and the rats eat us," sang one of the
Totalitarian soldiers. Men's heads and shoulders came up out of the
ground, watchfully. They decided to clamber out. An increasing
number of men emerged from the trenches and dug-outs ahead. The
desolation became populous.</p>

<p>"What's German for Fraternisation?" demanded Rud.</p>

<p>"Try Verbr&uuml;derung," said Olders.</p>

<p>It seemed right.</p>

<p>Then the men began to realise that this determined-looking
little gnome who had come to them out of the air was Rud, the World
Director, the Voice of the Common Man. The Soldiers' and Workers'
Committee came to him as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Fraternisation, they discovered, had already gone far since the
order to Cease Fire had released the pent-up good will of the
common soldiers. There had been a confused struggle on the
Democratic side, which were mostly English in this sector, to
maintain discipline and keep up the attitude of a victorious army.
Protesting officers had ordered the men back to their trenches and
flourished revolvers. But where the men persisted they had usually
decided not to shoot. This was the state of affairs along most of
the front. There were very few American or British officers
murdered. There were more on the opposite side, especially among
the Bavarians and Prussians. If Rud had ever had any doubts of the
effective permeation of the Common-sense propaganda, his reception
on either side of that deliquescent war front would have dispelled
them.</p>

<p>No one seemed to question his authority and the droning of
Bellacourt's planes overhead endorsed it. The bombing of the
central group of buildings had left the entire army in a state of
dismayed interrogation. It was, as Rud had foreseen, stunned. An
army is a vast organisation trained to take orders; for an hour of
agonising paralysis there was no one at all to give it orders, and
then Rud and Olders appeared, with an escort of World Police,
confident and assured, under the aegis of the planes. The
decapitated host crystallised about its new head, fell naturally
into postures of obedience. Here was order anyhow. And Orders. Life
seemed to have become rational again. Officials came to Rud,
saluted, reported their functions and were given directions.</p>

<p>Rud had the word passed. "Maintain discipline. All is as it
should be. Reedly wanted to make himself Dictator of the World. He
had prepared a coup d'etat and he has been killed. Every man to his
quarters..."</p>

<p>The prostrate routines of life stood up again..."To-morrow," he
said to Olders, "we shall have them playing football."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VIII</h3>

<p class="first">Rud had never been to a shoot, but he must have
seen a picture of one in some illustrated paper, and the scene
amidst the smoking ruins of the General Headquarters reminded him
grotesquely of the game spread out at the end of the day's sport.
The twilight was deepening into night, and a miscellany of lights,
electric lights of all sorts, oil lamps and the bursts of flame
from the wreckage, added strange shadows to the orderly
accumulation of bodies outside the ruins. Reedly had been found,
Rogers, Grossberg and a score of others.</p>

<p>Rud looked at the scorched and tattered bodies before him.</p>

<p>"I hate to see them. But&mdash;It was necessary I should see
them...I shall see them in my dreams."</p>

<p>He turned green.</p>

<p>"I don't like this sort of thing," he said to Olders. "I've
always been over-sensitive to horrors. Couldn't stand them. It's
just because I hate cruelty and bullying&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned aside and vomited.</p>

<p>A stranger appeared before him presently and saluted. "Radio,
sir," he said. "Headquarters' control."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"What is to be done, sir, to those officers who tried to seize
the radio station of the thirteenth army&mdash;they seem to have
been acting under Marshal Reedly's orders?"</p>

<p>"Shot," said Rud.</p>

<p>"All of them?"</p>

<p>"Every one of them. Now. Once you start shooting...You have to
go on. The fewer stories we have about this, the better."</p>

<p>Olders marvelled at him. He had been physically sick after he
had seen the body of Reedly and now he had recovered as if nothing
had happened. Now he was going to the radio to talk to Dreed at
Sloten and launch his view of the facts, a highly clarified
version, upon the world.</p>

<p>"Is that Dreed?" he said. "It is all over. You can tell the
world there has been a Dangerous Reactionary Conspiracy. Got that?
Nipped in the bud by the Master Director. It was an attempt to
surrender to the Nazi Commander and set up a military dictatorship
with Reedly as a sort of Napoleon. Make that clear. The Group has
taken control and the situation is well in hand. There was a brief
struggle in which World Marshal Reedly and most of the General
Staff of both armies were killed, and also a certain number of
officers of lower rank, orderlies and other attendants. Full lists
of casualties, which amount in all only to about three hundred,
will be published later. You need not give particulars of the
fighting. The air force has behaved with unswerving loyalty to the
Common World Cause and the armies have fraternised and acclaim the
World Directorate. D-I-R-E-C&mdash;you have it?"</p>

<p>Rud had decided to call himself Master World Director, and
nobody disputed the title.</p>

<p>Dawn found him still working. He had had repeated injections of
strychnine and he seemed indefatigably active. Bodisham had come to
him from Sloten and was enormously resourceful.</p>

<p>A little after sunrise Rud broke off to eat. He and Bodisham and
Olders swallowed eggs beaten up in rum and milk by way of
breakfast.</p>

<p>Thirp came from Stockholm about ten o'clock to report on
Bellacourt's state of mind. Bellacourt was all right. "You have
been working," said Thirp.</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"I've been getting reports from all over the world. It's been
like firing an unexpected pistol in a drawing-room. They're
stunned. But they are going to accept it. Generally."</p>

<p>"There'll be trouble."</p>

<p>"The work's only beginning," said Thirp. "But they will take
it&mdash;they will take it."</p>

<p>"Well, it's here we begin the real World Revolution," said Rud,
rubbing his jaded face to refresh himself. "Here and now. All the
rest has been just preparation, just getting a grip. Now, right
away, we have to set to work stamping out this poison they call
Federation. It is separatism trying to get back disguised as union.
This is only the first outbreak. Reedlys are a prolific family.
He's got brothers, cousins, all sorts of them. Every nation. Black
Reedlys there are; red and yellow. All over the world there will be
every sort of resistance to a World Common Law. All over the world
fellows saying: 'Now is my chance.' Directly the fear of war is
lifted, everywhere the old things will flame up again. Trust my
prophetic soul. All the old-world people who were scared into
silence for a time will be coming back, leaping, crawling, flying
in a gale of hope&mdash;like sparks, like burning twigs and
branches. It will be like beating out heath fires in sultry
weather. But we've got to beat and stamp now until the world is one
for ever...</p>

<p>"Because, you see," he said, with a sudden swoop from rhetoric
to reality, "nothing else is possible for us now. This is the way
we have to go, the only way. If we falter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We are shot," said Thirp.</p>

<p>He reflected. "Reedly would have shot you, anyhow," he said.</p>

<p>"And you," said Rud.</p>

<p>He went on working without sleep until nightfall. Then Chiffan,
who had arrived in the afternoon, affectionately masterful almost
in the old fashion, carried him off to a ch&acirc;teau some miles
behind the lines and put him to bed. He slept for twenty hours.</p>

<p>He was not told of the death of Steenhold for some days. He
heard the bad news manfully at last.</p>

<p>"Rotten luck," said Rud. "Poor old Steenhold!" and never spoke
of him again.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; IX</h3>

<p class="first">That had been close upon two crowded years ago,
and for all the intervening time Rud, with Bodisham perpetually at
his elbow and Thirp going to and fro on the earth, had been
struggling to make that day's victory real and to secure the
absolute dominance of the Common World State against a vast complex
of antagonisms, insubordinations, inertias, apathies, unanticipated
administrative difficulties, physical difficulties imperfectly
foreseen and sheer exhausting intricacies.</p>

<p>For the bare idea of a Common World State there was now a vast
majority of mankind, but directly it was defined as a positive
reorganisation of human affairs, as the establishment of a common
economic system, a common education, a common transport system,
free movement about the world, involving the rupture of a thousand
boundaries and a readjustment of the daily routines of the great
majority of lives, resistances began and grew. Mankind was quite
ready to accept peace but not to seek peace and ensue it.</p>

<p>A great and intricate warfare in the human imagination had
followed the obliteration of Reedly, attempts to explain, attempts
to compel, misrepresentations, denigrations, glorifications, false
simplifications, tactical and strategic lying, detractions,
stupefactions, hysterical reactions, blind insurgence.</p>

<p>Gradually things began to fall into place as the idea that the
Common World State had come to stay prevailed over the belief that
it was merely a provisional arrangement, pending a satisfactory
restoration and adjustment of old claims. Everywhere a larger
proportion of people, especially in the younger generation, set
itself to learn new ways of living and abandoned the thought of
returning to the old routines. What had been Utopianism a few years
before became normal common-sense, and romantic traditionalism
retreated into that world of imaginative reality from which
Utopianism had come.</p>

<p>The Group, with vastly increased resources and now everywhere in
control, resumed its pre-war propaganda of world unity on an
enormously enlarged scale. It was undercutting rival conceptions of
life by withdrawing endowments and subsidies, taking over schools,
taking possession of religious buildings in the name of art and
history. It had deprived reactionary newspaper propaganda of the
incentive of gross profits by its rigorous censorship of newspaper
advertisement and by its separation of newspaper finance from
general speculative activities. The complex public controls of
economic life that had come into existence under war conditions
were retained and amplified to carry on the peace. Profit-seeking
production and distribution had already been squeezed into a mere
corner of life; the main staple industries and housing and
transport were already in the hands of the munition controls of the
victors, and this time there was no storm of financial
racketeering. Without a break the world war passed into world
adjustment. This time there was no Peace Conference and no Peace
Treaty.</p>

<p>The Group had found an unexpected amount of support from the
world of scientific men. After a deliberate survey of contemporary
fact the World Association for the Advancement of Science had
produced a lucid and unemotional exposition of the attitude of the
ever-multiplying class of scientific workers to the World
Directorate. In less than two years after the coup d'etat that had
made Rud World Director, the World Association produced its
official declaration that the Common World State was also the
Scientific State, and that the whole body of organised knowledge
was definitely in support of the Directorate. In effect the
scientific body was deliberately taking upon itself the r&ocirc;le of the
Church in the theory of Medieval Christendom, it was becoming the
repository of knowledge, the directive power in education, and the
criterion of all social organisation and readjustment. It was not
so much proposing itself as tacitly becoming a new sort of Church,
a progressive Church, a monistic congregationalism with ministers
indeed, but without priest or pope.</p>

<p>Its declaration surveyed the biological situation with an
unemotional explicitness. The human species had to adapt its life
to the new conditions material inventions had created for it or
perish. It embodied and applied ideas that were already apprehended
by such liberal intelligences as old Doctor Carstall while Rud was
still a rebellious undergraduate. They were now the universal ideas
of the scientific world. Without world unification the species
would destroy itself by the enlarged powers that had come to it.
This, said the men of science, is no theory, no political
alternative; it is a statement of fact. Men had to pool their
political, economic and educational lives. There was no other way
for them but a series of degenerative phases leading very plainly
to extinction. They could not revert now. They had to go
on&mdash;up or down. They had gone too far with civilisation and in
societies, to sink back into a merely "animal" life again. The hold
of the primates on life had always been a precarious one. Except
where they were under human protection all the other great apes
were extinct. Now plainly man had to go on to a larger life, a
planetary existence, or perish in his turn.</p>

<p>The survival of a degenerate man, a sort of "poor white" in the
kingdom of nature, was for many reasons unthinkable. These many
reasons were given succinctly in the declaration. One that struck
Rud with a sense of novelty was that the rats could do that sort of
thing so much better.</p>

<p>Thus the men of science. That declaration had come to hand a few
days ago, and Rud had read it with a certain feeling of
self-applause. He had been doing what he had done in the name of
the Common Man, but apparently he had been doing the right thing
all the time. If he found anything to object to in this declaration
it was that there was a certain failure in it to recognise his own
guiding r&ocirc;le in the release of the Scientific State.</p>

<p>There was an impressive array of signatures. He ran his eye down
the list. Several were the names of men he knew to be in
administrative positions. Then he saw "Richard Carstall".</p>

<p>He stopped short at that.</p>

<p>"Richard Carstall," he whispered. "Richard? Dick? Dick Carstall.
That's the man! And I went to school with him at Hooplady House!
And afterwards he was doing research at Camford. They gave him a
fellowship the year before I came down. Old Carstall's son. Old
Carstall the atheist, who made a job for Alf and Alf thought it was
an answer to prayer!"</p>

<p>Afterwards he recalled that. He thought of Carstall in the
night. He saw him tall and self-assured, telling him just what was
"done" and just what one didn't do. Now as Rud contemplated the
vast view from his balcony, that sustaining declaration came into
his head again.</p>

<p>"They might have said all that two years ago," he remarked to
the mountains and the sky. "But these scientific people always like
to be quite sure of things before they do anything. I've been doing
the heavy work while you've been theorising&mdash;and don't you
forget that, Doctor, Professor, my good Lord Carstall. It's all
natural forces and inevitable and all that&mdash;so you say
<i>now</i>. But your theories are excellent, and I don't see why
they shouldn't be made the basis of our new political
education...</p>

<p>"I bear you no malice about it. None."</p>

<p>He went down the steps to the balcony on which he would have his
breakfast.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; X</h3>

<p class="first">The house he occupied had been built not so much
to his designs as to his suggestions. For after the nature of his
type, he had strong architectural impulses. It was built into a
cliff that jutted out upon a wide bend of the River Durance.</p>

<p>All the world was busy then rebuilding or building anew or
irrigating or planting or restoring soil. For centuries men had
developed the art of resurfacing their cities and roads, but now
they were blending and manufacturing soils as they needed them and
distributing them where they could be cultivated most conveniently
and agreeably. None too soon had world afforestation been taken in
hand. The old competitive order of little nations and private
finance had already stripped the world of half its forests and a
third of its soil and exterminated seals, whales and a thousand
once-abundant resources. But now with the establishment of a real
Common Ownership, a tremendous recuperation had begun. It was
already in hand by that time.</p>

<p>But it had not seemed unreasonable to Rud, or indeed to anyone
in the Group, that a large number of artists, architects, experts
and skilled workers of all sorts should be diverted from the
general reconditioning of the world to the special task of making a
great cluster of residences and halls, laboratories, work-rooms and
offices for the occupation of the chief members of the Group, upon
a site that Rud had chosen. It had its aerodrome; it had great
roads leading to it; it was in immediate nervous contact with all
the world. It was a lovely piece of country he had hit upon, and
this towering assemblage of structural loveliness challenged every
palace and splendour of the past. Rud's own quarters had taken
precedence of the rest and had been completed for his occupation
with an incredible swiftness. It was, so to speak, a first
intimation of all that lay before the new world.</p>

<p>It was Rud's own fancy that he should sleep in a bed upon a dais
in a great arched loggia, into which his dressing-rooms and so
forth opened from behind, and from which he could descend to the
open-air life of his grand balcony. His early upbringing in stuffy
little rooms had given him a sort of architectural
claustrophobia.</p>

<p>A considerable staff of secretaries, assistants, messengers and
domestic workers had already been assembled about these first
completed portions of the new World Centre. Bodisham was
accommodated and Thirp was coming soon. The place undoubtedly had a
magnificence surpassing that of any of the kingly and presidential
residences and palaces in which he might have taken up his
quarters. But it was free from old-world associations and
suggestions of inequality and pretension. There was no regal state
about all this, there was no pose of aristocracy, no court. There
was an insistence upon simplicity in its splendour. There were no
bows nor salaams nor prostrations, and nothing in the nature of
ceremonial.</p>

<p>For Rud after all was no exploiter, no tyrant; no sweater of his
fellow-creatures. He was very clear in his mind about
that&mdash;clearer than many other people. He was the Director of
an equalitarian world, a natural leader. He was just the Common
Man&mdash;triumphant at last and enthroned.</p>

<h2>I. &mdash; WORLD TRUSTEE</h2>

<h3>&sect; I</h3>

<p class="first">In a few short years the multitudinous common man
throughout the earth had to make what he could of a stupendous
fact, of which he had had no previous warning, namely Rud, the
World Trustee. And Rud being himself, as indeed he always alleged,
no more than a common man, had also, with scarcely more
preparation, to make what he could of himself. The mystical
personification of himself as the universal common man was the most
congenial interpretation that had occurred to him, and for a time
he clung to it.</p>

<p>He would like to have said to mankind that he was just
themselves in a concentrated form, and that what seemed good to him
was necessarily good for them all, yet more and more did Thirp make
it clear to him that the pervading infantilism of his
fellow-creatures demanded no such mystical and incomprehensible
identification with him but objective leadership and paternalism.
They refused to live in him, they kept themselves to themselves,
but they were quite ready to live under him. So with a rapidly
diminishing reluctance Rud allowed a sympathetic yet heroic version
of himself to be built up in the public mind. And as this objective
version was established throughout the world, it brought conviction
to himself. Except in rare moments of private exaltation, he ceased
to be that universal man of his profounder speculations and instead
he became merely the greatest and most greatly advertised of
men.</p>

<p>At first Norvel was manifestly much less convinced than Thirp of
the necessity of presenting Rud to the world as the Hero of the
Revolution. Norvel disliked Thirp and suspected his motives. But
gradually as he studied the strange novel thing upon which he
himself had to work, this new-born world-mind in the cradle of its
education, his distrust of Thirp relaxed. There was understanding
in Thirp's idea, whatever desire sustained it. Immature humanity
has indeed, Norvel was forced to admit, an insatiable craving for
exaggerated personalities, for vast effigies publicised about a
core of fact. Humanity still insists upon them; it has always had
its gods, as it has had its saints when its gods became
metaphysical, it craves for powers and princes, for celebrities,
champions, stars. It would take more than two eventful decades to
alter that. Norvel, always reasonable, allowed himself to be
persuaded by Thirp that unless Rud could be magnified, projected on
the screen of the heavens, made dominant in the world imagination,
it was inevitable that this urge to deify, round and about the
world, would create for itself local dissentient and disintegrating
figures, Robin Hoods and William Tells perhaps, Wallaces and
Bruces, Gandhis and Garibaldis, to the great injury and confusion
of the nascent common unification of mankind. Better let Thirp have
his way...</p>

<p>Norvel, like so many of the Group and their associates, was
growing rapidly to the scale of his occasions. He was getting a
firmer and more comprehensive grasp upon his particular aspect of
the world problem, and he was gathering round him a school of
colleagues who shared ideas and purposes with him. It was a
parallel process to Bellacourt's consolidation of the world
services of transport and distribution, to Irwell's successful
invention of a monetary and financial network practically free from
speculative corruption, and to the scientific reorganisation of
production by Roots and Holbank, who were now, among other
innovations, manufacturing soil from crude rock and resettling
agricultural workers at the rate of a hundred square miles a
week.</p>

<p>Norvel had observed the decadence of the newspaper, in the days
before the War of Ideologies, until it had become a mere daily
entertainment and bazaar display, he had developed and dominated
the world-wide distribution of cheap books, and he had acquired a
very extensive mass of experience with all the new and multiplying
appliances for mental stimulation and exchange by cinema, radio,
microphotography and the like. He had organised an effective world
survey of schools and colleges, and he was now in a position to
remodel, multiply and expand them as he chose and so far as the
available material would let him. That was a tremendous task. The
Revolution had indeed crippled the power of business interests and
the old religions to hinder the liberation of the human mind, but
it had done little to equip the minds it had emancipated. For the
purposes of a world community, he found the world even in its most
progressive regions, <i>thinly</i> educated, thinly to a dismaying
degree. Quite as much as Roots and Holbank, who had realised the
limits set to vegetable growth by soil insufficiency, he found he
had to begin the new crop of humanity from the ground upward.</p>

<p>Education still for a large majority of human beings meant
little more than teaching them in a primitive fashion to read and
count a little. It was only in the most advanced communities that
the need of continuous education throughout the whole life was
recognised. For the multitude, such world-pictures as they had, had
been supplied in a haphazard fashion by the talk of the people
about them, by the unscrupulous statements of the advertisement
newspapers, concerned chiefly with the sale of worthless drugs,
adulterated foodstuffs and plausible commodities, by political
propagandists and the appeals of religious organisations. A few
hundred so-called universities, of unequal merit, a flimsy network
of impecunious scientific societies, a loosely organised trade of
book publishing and distribution, were all that there was to guide
the general mental operations of the entire world community. The
common man at large had remained mainly ignorant even of what was
known, and had floundered through life in a muddle of prejudices,
misconceptions and downright delusions. That was the educational
level of the middle twentieth century, and upon this insufficient
and decaying detritus of the petty cultures of the past it fell to
the new educational administration to translate Bodisham's hopeful
network of circles and liaisons into reality, and build the stout
mental organisation needed by the new world.</p>

<p>Norvel found himself involved in a gigantic extension of the old
structures of thought, research and instruction, in the evocation
and training of vast armies of teachers, in the application of film
and aerial to school use and the establishment throughout the world
of millions of those community centres that manifestly had to
replace the schools and home instruction of the past. He had
assembled a magnificent group of associates and an ever-increasing
multitude of mentally quickened helpers; he was sustained by an
increasing realisation that most human beings want to learn and are
ready to meet capable teaching half-way; but for all that it had
become plainer and plainer to him that to establish even the broad
framework for the mental reconditioning of mankind would be a task
that would demand the sustained devotion of hundreds of thousands
of workers through some scores of years.</p>

<p>And in the interim, what was to be done for the passing
generations? For the present and for the rest of his lifetime, it
was plain to him that he would have to endure the spectacle of vast
masses of the population, white, yellow, brown and black,
under-educated through no fault of their own, and for sheer lack of
equipment, staffing and organisation, still largely un-educatable.
With a job too big for him before him, it was manifest he had to
economise all his resources. He had to concentrate first upon the
bare scaffold of the new intellectual order and work for
progressive increments in enlightenment, and beyond that the
multitude would have to be left to much the same methods of
information and suggestion as had served before the Revolution.</p>

<p>"We may stop some of the quack medicines at the source," he
said, "but until we have put doctors, teachers and then more and
more of the public through the mill of a real education, they will
still prefer to be given quackery. We have got our Revolution, but
we still have to establish it and make it real. Revolution or no
Revolution, we have for the present to let the public from China to
Peru have what the public wants. Putting more and more of our own
proper stuff into the mixture as time goes on..."</p>

<p>"Precisely," said Thirp.</p>

<p>"So since a Revolution seems to be impossible without an
incarnation," said Norvel, turning to Rud, "we have to hand you
over to a press agent and the Revolution has to organise a
publicity department for you. You have to be Trustee for Humanity,
no less&mdash;until Humanity comes of age."</p>

<p>Rud tried to suppress a faint gleam of excitement. "So be it,"
he said.</p>

<p>"You have never, I suppose, read Frazer's <i>Golden
Bough</i>?"</p>

<p>"Never had time," said Rud.</p>

<p>"About those sacrificial kings," said Norvel. "You'd be
interested."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; II</h3>

<p class="first">At the bottom of Rud's nature, covered over and
suppressed there had always been an acute sense of his physical
inferiority. He had even an exaggerated sense of his own ugliness
and his bodily feebleness. He had a passionate impulse to exercise
power, but his primary method of exercising power was to destroy,
and he consented only to the vast constructiveness his movement was
developing, because that alone guaranteed the complete
disappearance of the institutions, restraints and compulsions he
hated. It was at first with a definitely reluctant scepticism that
he found Thirp, with Norvel's connivance, building up a detailed
legend of a pseudo-personality for him. Modesty with him at any
rate was fear of failure. Maybe that is always the essense of
modesty. So that when at length he realised that Thirp's propaganda
might indeed attain its ends, his confidence in his essential self
blossomed.</p>

<p>It would need vast volumes after the manner of Tom Harrisson's
Mass Observers to convey the hundreds of millions of individual
reactions to the intricate advertisement process by which the
vaguely apprehended World Director of the Common-sense Revolution
became a concrete living personality in the human imagination. It
followed upon the best precedents. He was "displayed" by word and
picture, put upon postage stamps and on public buildings, written
up, systematically alluded to; a thousand anecdotes were invented
about him. Skilful photographers arranged lighting about him and
contrived novel angles of approach, and for every picture of him
that went into circulation, scores were destroyed. His scowl upon
his ample brow became an expression of concentration upon human
destiny; his eyes caught an abstracted benevolence. He looked less
and less into his mirror and more and more at those approved
photographs. He became more and more interested in the press
cuttings expounding himself, that his secretaries selected.</p>

<p>He talked upon the air at chosen intervals, and millions of
simple homes to which the Revolution had brought security listened
to his indignation at the disorders of the past and to his promises
for the future. Never more would a bomb descend upon a house nor a
son be taken off to war. He made a practice of explaining in simple
language the developing merits of the new order, using the modest
yet regal "we" and unobtrusively annexing all the credit for the
bold constructive work of his multiplying associates. These men and
women were building now like bees, but he figured as the
bee-keeper. To the simple mind everywhere in the world, he became
the Promethean figure that brought the light and heat of the Power
Administration into the social circle; he also was production and
his name was Plenty; he was distribution and his name was Service;
he it was who now fed the world variously, employed it
interestingly, instructed it, released it for holidays and travel
about the world. He had slain soldiering, slain it in the person of
Reedly. He had guided the world through the terrific opening crises
of the Age of Adaptation to their present universal hope and
freedom. Now one was free; now one could learn and live.</p>

<p>Norvel in his private thoughts decided that this was as good a
working embodiment of the scientific ordering of the world as
mankind could have for the time being, and as good a use as any for
Rud. Personal Leadership the multitude would still insist upon
until his schools made a new generation. Until the human crowd
could respect itself it might just as well concentrate its respect
upon Rud. Meanwhile a new world-brain organisation would grow and
spread, the proportion of critical and enlightened intelligences
would increase in geometrical progression, irony would creep into
loyal gestures. In due time Rud would die in glory, revered as the
father of a new civilisation, the last and greatest of the culture
gods; and the human mind would be ready to adjust itself to the
realities of the great transition, and ultimately get him back into
his due place in the universe.</p>

<p>While common men were still amenable to the idea of power, still
anxious to say "Yes, Sir" to some one they felt would be
protective, the only way of abstracting the commanding quality from
ownership, money, class, rank and elected authority, was by
concentrating it for them in this way upon a single
individual&mdash;who would at any rate be mortal. Norvel assumed
that gradually they would acquire the habit of doing their jobs
without any other inducement than the intrinsic interest of the
job. So, under Rud, acquiescing in Rud and sustaining Rud, he set
himself to his essential work. Irwell, Bellacourt, Roots, Darwin
and all the able new chiefs who were coming into the comprehensive
network of Bodisham's scientific replanning of human life on its
new scale, worked in much the same spirit, content that Rud had
cleared the way for them, and Thirp was allowed to fence off a
special department for the organisation, according to the best
precedents, of Rud's publicity, his establishment in the human
imagination as the sole, unchallengeable Trustee of power.</p>

<p>Thirp did not do this work himself, but he made all the
arrangements for its being done. His essential quality was a feline
curiosity in the less obvious motives of his fellow-creatures. It
was this that had first attracted him to criminology and prison
reform. He was interested in human errors and misconceptions, his
life as a watcher and shepherd of rebellious spirits, was primarily
one of vicarious anti-social activities. He had Rud's fear and
hatred of stark power, but in a subtler, more penetrating form. He
had worked with energy, he had become a party man, because he
realised the trend of the old order towards a mosaic of military
and spasmodically moral tyrannies, but he had no desire whatever to
establish a new order with possibly even austerer disciplines of
its own.</p>

<p>He was tied up now to the Revolution, he did not dare turn
against it, but in the place of the new strenuousness of Norvel and
Bodisham, all his instincts would have preferred a gently rotten
society in which the essential queerness of humanity could have
been stimulated and released in the fullest abundance. He did not
believe in anything that looked simple. He had a fear of simple
things. To his intelligence they were rigid things without escapes.
He had a mind for orchids, queerly shaped fungi, peculiar insects,
drugs, wicked little carvings in jade and ivory, occult phenomena
and Rosicrucian mysteries. He was the strangest, most alien of all
the adherents of the last Revolutionary Group.</p>

<p>But Rud had a use for him. He felt in him a kindred fear of
restraint, to which the others were oblivious. He perceived Thirp's
animal alertness to any antagonistic movement in the world about
them. It was, he remembered, Thirp's sharpness and his own natural
distrust which had saved him and the Revolution from Reedly. The
others in the Group would have been caught. They could take care of
everything but themselves. Bodisham would have been killed like
Archimedes over his diagrams.</p>

<p>The old world had left over a very considerable class of
advertisers, personal journalists, agents, impresarios and the
like, many of whom were odd characters and so very attractive to
Thirp, and with the return of confidence now that the revolutionary
blood bath and blasting operations were over, gossip, organised
entertainment, social life and a disingenuous patina upon
behaviour, were reappearing in the world. Caricature looked up, and
little non-political local talk papers, living on their merits,
broke out in every language. The leading figures of the
pre-revolutionary world, from kings to cinema stars, had had their
publicity cultivated and protected by experts of outstanding
brilliance, many of whom were still alive and available for Thirp.
Dimly apprehended behind the arras of history is Quinlan, Rud's
publicity manager, building up his official picture and arranging
interesting and characteristic events for him. He made all Rud's
comings and goings important; he made his birthday a great public
event from pole to pole.</p>

<p>All over the earth on that auspicious day flags were flying.
Rud, in one of his rhetorical moments, had designed a world flag.
He had seen a man handling a pile of cases for some public use. On
each was a little national flag of the country of origin, and this
man had a piece of white chalk in his hand and just crossed off the
flag on each packet. Some national clash had to be considered. "Of
course!" said Rud. "Cross off all the flags." He made the world
flag a white saltire on azure. And for all regional or local
purposes he had a white saltire, imposed upon the national or
provincial colours. All over the world now the birthday bunting
fluttered, bearing over every racial or cultural symbol that white
clamp of peace.</p>

<p>A practice of personal relationship was fostered by Quinlan. It
was physically impossible for Rud to meet the entire human
brotherhood and shake hands with it, nevertheless people were
emboldened to write and even telephone to him. His fan mail
attained astronomical dimensions. To meet that Quinlan was creating
a huge staff of Director's Correspondents, many of whom could
produce a fair imitation of Rud's handwriting or speak almost with
his voice. They were most of them polyglots, and there were very
few languages in which Rud's composite personality could not reply.
So that Rud, at one and the same moment, could take an interest in
a little girl's white rabbits in Pekin, parley with a young
Norwegian who was disappointed in his preliminary trials for the
air service because of a poisoned hand, and promise an enquiry into
the troubles of an old lady tied in knots by arthritis who didn't
like her doctor in Perth.</p>

<p>"Who wants Providence when they have me?" said Rud, and "Isn't
it amazing that neither the Vatican nor British Royalty ever
thought of this!"</p>

<p>Thirp collected half a dozen convicted but now reformed forgers
who could do the most brilliant variations of Rud's signatures.</p>

<p>Operations of this sort stimulated the world-wide desire for
closer contacts and nearer relationships still further. Strange
imaginations appeared.</p>

<p>"Seventeen women to-day," said Quinlan, "want to bear him a
child. That is mild. It was thirty-seven last Saturday."</p>

<p>"The old morality never sat very well on the ladies," said
Thirp. "No...But they endured it as women will...All races, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Practically," said Quinlan, "but mainly Americans and
Europeans."</p>

<p>"You haven't let Him know?"</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>"Good," said Thirp, with his head on one side, putting his long
hands together as if in prayer. "In a way, it's an attractive idea.
I don't know...If anything of the sort did occur...Something might
be done. But it would have to be kept a profound secret. Just a
trifle <i>too</i> modern...I suppose that sort of thing will come.
If there are Dictators a hundred years hence it will seem quite
sensible to make them the Fathers of the People. I'm surprised they
didn't try that in Russia."</p>

<p>Quinlan consulted the eugenists. He thought, too, that something
might be done about it, and that something of the sort might come,
but it was clear that for the present the business bristled with
difficulties. He did not put the matter before Rud until his own
ideas about Rud's possible reactions were more definite.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; III</h3>

<p class="first">After all Rud ate an egg that morning. That
beautiful house of his was a reassuring setting. The mountains were
benevolent. And it was, he suddenly remembered, his birthday.</p>

<p>The mists of his nightmare evaporated in the warm sunshine of
the great terrace. He forgot that sense of a vindictive pursuit
that marred so much of his nocturnal existence. The sense of being
the overworked servant of mankind passed into a glow of righteous
self-applause. "I am forty-four," he thought, standing at the
parapet and surveying his particular lovely piece of world. And
when I was twenty I was messing about Camford in a dog's-eared
mortar-board and a patched gown and I hadn't the dimmest idea of
what was to become of me! At least&mdash;yes; I <i>had</i> even
then, a dim idea...</p>

<p>"There was all the world to take and I took it. Luck? I suppose
so. Vision? Inspiration? My twenty-first birthday: where was I? I
remember. Took Chiffan on the river. Twenty-second? Poor old
Steenhold made what he called a 'porty' for it. Still at Camford
that was. Twenty-two years ago...</p>

<p>"I took some risks. Nobody knows how I funked Bohun. Lord! How I
dreaded him! It was a close thing, too, with Reedly. I timed that
well. I knew my man. I chose my moment. H'm. And now I have to put
this silly little old world in order for good and all&mdash;and
make sure the old rottenness doesn't creep back&mdash;before I go.
Giant's Task. Who would have thought it&mdash;twenty years ago?
Great Accomplishment. And still gigantic things to do. Four and
forty&mdash;I wonder how long I shall last.</p>

<p>"It's all thrust into my hands now, almost in spite of myself.
I'm still not sure. Never sure. Unless I see to things myself. If I
could only trust these others to carry out their jobs without me.
Bodisham&mdash;Bodisham is good&mdash;no doubt he is good&mdash;but
he has to be urged. Circumspection. He sees difficulties.
Over-elaborates. He is an old spider with those round shoulders of
his and those glasses,&mdash;How round his shoulders are getting!
but all his plans and diagrams would change back to spiders' webs
again if I did not insist upon their being translated into steel
and living substance. I am his life giver&mdash;his reality giver.
Says I am rough-handed&mdash;impatient. But things have to be done.
He's practically a man of science&mdash;and God knows that men of
science are Devils for not hurrying. I found him dreaming. I made
him what he is, my constructive truffle-hound. Bellacourt, too, is
good&mdash;in his way. Most people would have been afraid of
him&mdash;that fool Reedly was&mdash;but I knew better. I wish they
were all like Bellacourt. Sticks to his job. I've done some good
picking in my time. Roots was my find, and I certainly saw the
quality of Holbank as soon as anyone. Irwell&mdash;in a sense he
has always been in the movement, but&mdash;anyhow&mdash;I never got
rid of him. Norvel?&mdash;just a little loose-minded, loose but
abundant. And conceited. Sometimes irritatingly conceited. No good
telling him things. At the most he pretends to listen. He's got the
same queer idea as Bodisham, that things should never be speeded up
too much. Never relax, but never hurry. One could imagine he
expected to live five hundred years. Do we want all these schools
of his? Don't people for all practical purposes know enough
already? And he goes behind me and doesn't do the things I
say&mdash;unless I say them very definitely. He's all for
letting&mdash;what is it?&mdash;individual initiative run loose.
But I suppose he has all this academic, scholastic business at his
fingers' ends. There is nobody else like him. It would be amusing
to go back to Camford one day and see what he has done down there.
He does a lot, but he hasn't Thirp's flair for what is happening.
Things grow up behind his back.</p>

<p>"If I'd had the educational machine in my own hands I'd have
nipped this New Catholic movement in the bud...I may have to see to
that yet...</p>

<p>"Olders? Olders is coming on. The typical Civil Servant, able to
carry out anything and start nothing. A sense of duty to anyone who
will give him orders. The world would fall to pieces if there
weren't such men.</p>

<p>"Dreed, of course, might easily be brighter than he is...</p>

<p>"And Chiffan is Chiffan&mdash;good old Happy Thoughts. With a
trick of saying things just before I do, or anyone else, damn
him...</p>

<p>"I couldn't do without Thirp. At first I didn't like him because
of his queer voice and his flat hair and his face like an earnest
spinster&mdash;and those hands. Like a praying Mantis. But how
penetratingly he works! He looks under things and through
things&mdash;that cynical touch&mdash;a cruel sense of reality. And
he tells me things. He finds out things I don't know. The others
are beginning to keep things from me. Fear my critical glance.
After all, where would the world be now, where should we all be
now, if Thirp hadn't known about those post cards of Reedly's? He's
as sharp as a terrier in spite of that drawling eunuch's
voice...</p>

<p>"Thirp is my extra eye...</p>

<p>"I suppose altogether it's as good a team as I could have
assembled. That's where my own Revolution beats its precursors. I
am building up a World Civil Service. I am making my Code.
<i>My</i> Revolution has come to stay. <i>My</i> Revolution!</p>

<p>"All the same, essentially, the world's still on my shoulders.
On my shoulders. Prometheus-Atlas. I didn't ask for it..."</p>

<p>So, if not quite so definitely as we have worded it here,
thought Rud on his four-and-fortieth birthday.</p>

<p>He thrust the little breakfast table away from him. He touched a
button and a young man appeared.</p>

<p>He and Rud were living now in an equalitarian world.
Nevertheless there was a certain deference in his manner, for as
yet equalisation was incomplete.</p>

<p>"I'll go into conference," said Rud. "Will you tell the Group I
am coming to join them? I have to keep in touch."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; IV</h3>

<p class="first">The conference received him without undue
excitement. Only Bodisham, Norvel, Dreed, Roots and Chiffan were
present. He sat down in the place reserved for him at the head of
the table, and regardless of what point they might be discussing at
the moment said: "Well, tell me all about it..."</p>

<p>For some time they had been drawing up a document which Bodisham
had originally suggested and which Rud had embarked upon with much
enthusiasm. His conception of it had been rather different from
Bodisham's; but in the long run Bodisham's tenacious mind became
dominant in its production.</p>

<p>The title at any rate was Rud's. It was to be called The
Fundamental Law, and its general purpose was to present all the
structural ideas of the new world society in such a form that they
could be used in schools and colleges everywhere and made the
criterion, the standard pattern, for administrative and subsidiary
legislative action. But Bodisham had conceived something much more
scientific, explicit and directive, and under his influence the
Fundamental Law began to take on something of the systematic detail
of the Code Napoleon. It acquired the bulk of a handbook, the tone
of a textbook. It cited authorities; it not only made statements
but proved them. Chiffan made some bright interpolations, but
Bodisham's tendency towards a serious practicality prevailed over
him. The rest of the Group contributed little to this "Bible of the
New World". (One of Rud's rejected phrases.) Thirp, Bellacourt,
Holbank, Darwin, and the indefinite fringe of new and occasional
members who came and went to the administrative centre at the
instance of Bodisham and Rud, rarely put in an appearance at these
deliberations.</p>

<p>Rud was greatly excited by the composition of the exordium. He
drafted that, re-wrote it again after a long and fruitful
discussion with Bodisham, argued a number of minor points, lost his
temper, recovered his balance, re-phrased the final version. But
after the exordium his interest waned. He was becoming more and
more impatient with detail; it irritated him; it irritated him to
realise how much more ably almost any practical question could be
handled by his colleagues; once or twice, in order not to
contradict himself, he had walked out upon some unexpected issue on
which he had given way to impulse and taken the wrong line. No one
ever reminded him of these occasions, but they went on with the
planning under Bodisham's direction as though he had not
intervened. He began to come late, and on one or two occasions he
had absented himself altogether.</p>

<p>That exordium is by itself a fairly comprehensive document. It
recites ably and clearly all the primary ideas that had grown out
of the crude popular Leftism from which he and Chiffan had started.
But they had been tried out now, scrutinised, polished. It
incorporated Bodisham's analysis of the meaning of power, and the
essence of Rud's mysticism.</p>

<p>"The whole planet earth," it commences, "is the inalienable
heritage and possession of the Common Man. The World Revolution
bases its methods of rule, law, production, distribution, its
education and its finance, upon that conception of a common
ownership." Then with a sweeping thoroughness it disposes of the
pretensions of sovereign states, of non-functional proprietorship,
of sex, race, caste or class, of usurers or any type of creditors
or successful gamblers, to qualify that principle of the
indivisible sovereignty of the whole race. Food, shelter, freedom,
the healthiest possible life and universally accessible knowledge
constituted the birthright of every mentally and physically sound
child born into the world.</p>

<p>In accordance with this initial statement the exordium goes on
to define the main branches of human interest and activity as they
have henceforth to be administered. All Rud's fundamental maxims
and all that he had picked up and assimilated from the more
penetrating dicta of Chiffan and the more scientific and
comprehensive approach of Bodisham are woven into this general
statement. And it repudiates the idea that it has any unnatural and
arbitrary quality. It insists on the logical necessity of the
Revolution. Now and again an unmistakable biblical echo, due to the
early education of Chiffan, appears in the phrasing. "The
Revolution," it says explicitly, "came not to destroy but
fulfil."</p>

<p>"The whole earth belongs to everyone. That is not a doctrine,
that is a fact&mdash;long overlooked. We restore what individuals
and groups and gangs and nations have appropriated in the past. But
restoration is not a reversal of human conditions. It is only a
clarification. There is no real distinction between political,
social and economic control, that is an error that has crept into
social life as it has developed. They are inseparable in a rational
order. Individual wages, money, properly shrink in importance as
competent directorates are established. That is no Communist dogma;
it is commonsense..."</p>

<p>And further, the exordium of the Fundamental Law explains: "The
essence of the Revolution is to abolish the attainment of
unqualified power of man over man either by vote-getting,
money-pressure or crude terror. The Revolution repudiates profit or
terror altogether as methods of human intercourse. It turns the
attention of men and women back from a frantic and futile struggle
for the means of power, a struggle against our primary social
instincts, to an innate urgency to make and to a beneficial
competition for pre-eminence in social service. It recalls man to a
clean and creative life from the entanglements and perversion of
secondary issues into which he has fallen. It replaces property and
official authority by the compelling prestige of sound achievement.
Eminent service remains the only source of influence left in the
world..."</p>

<p>That last idea is pure Bodisham, but the voice is the voice of
Rud.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; V</h3>

<p class="first">When Rud read over his final version of the
introduction to the Group, they endorsed it very cordially. "You
could not have put our common faith better," said Chiffan. The
others murmured approval in the same key.</p>

<p>A wave of conscious nobility swept through Rud. "This&mdash;to
be blunt about it&mdash;is the time when we might usurp, and I
won't," he said, in a mood of real magnificence, and proceeded at
once to a completeness of usurpation that dwarfed all
precedent.</p>

<p>"It is clear," he said, "that the effective reorganisation of
the machinery of administration is an immensely intricate job, and
that any attempt to establish a democratic control by these
shattered, inexperienced and mentally confused populations must
wait upon the creation and working of Norvel's educational
machinery. They would not know at present what was needed nor what
to ask for. A crude return to electoral politics would give every
mischievous rascal in the world an opportunity, and it would
revitalise all the national, religious, racial organisations that
are down and out indeed but still in a sort of attenuated
existence. I think we are right in assuming a general acquiescence.
Here we are, and there is no effective revolt against us. What I
propose we do is to go right ahead, establish our world system
first and then as an educated generation comes along&mdash;</p>

<p>"When?" asked Norvel.</p>

<p>"In two or three decades it will be becoming effective."</p>

<p>"I hope," said Norvel, and continued to regard Rud
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"And until then we do things by decree. We will assume we have
been elected and we will decree. Afterwards we will ask them what
they think of it. The game for power is over&mdash;yes&mdash;and we
have won. We cannot risk having everything upset by a new squabble
for power. We'll have no power politics and no politicians again,
until the new world is in working order, and then we will ask
whether the world wants them back. We will establish everything
firmly on the basis of this Fundamental Law, and face them with
actuality. How else can we do it? Finally, I assume we will
establish some sort of conference for the endorsement of the world
order and, if necessary, for its revision&mdash;we shall crown the
work with a representative legislature&mdash;a more or less
representative legislature, representative I suppose by callings
and services rather than localities. For we have de-localised the
world. There are still local populations, but there is no more
local community. The abolition of distance means the end of
political geography. Isn't that the way, Bodisham?"</p>

<p>"I agree entirely," said Bodisham, recognising phrase after
phrase as his own, and nodding quietly as they passed him, while
the others acquiesced. "That is our way," said Bodisham.</p>

<p>"Then and then only," said Rud, "my task will be completed and I
shall give way to&mdash;whatever we find is the best way of
co-ordinating our various World Administrations, and I will resign
and end my days simply as the common man I am."</p>

<p>There was a pause. Rud sat at the end of the table looking
modest but firm.</p>

<p>"You couldn't say fairer," said Chiffan.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VI</h3>

<p class="first">One of the minor difficulties of these conferences
to produce the Fundamental Law was the intrusion of a number of
suggestions for minor changes in the natural texture of life, in
numeration, time-reckoning, symbols, language and the like. Some of
them were manifestly overdue reforms, and most of these were
carried through automatically by the ministries concerned.
Revolutions are always hurried and hustled processes; they never
make novel reconstructions except by accident; but on the other
hand if there is any cut-and-dried rationalisation waiting to be
accepted, they carry it through almost automatically.</p>

<p>The reform of the calendar is a case in point. A variety of
rearrangements had been exhaustively discussed, and a rough outline
of what was needed had been established. Norvel was very
uncompromising in that matter. He accepted the World Calendar
Association scheme which has given us our twelve months of thirty
days and the necessary intercalary ones, but he would have no
further changes. He wouldn't have the months renamed or the count
of the years broken. He wouldn't hear of a ten-day week. He
overrode Thirp on these points.</p>

<p>Thirp had hinted at a renaming of the days&mdash;or at least of
three extra days&mdash;and even thrown out the suggestion of a
Rud-day. Possibly even a Lenin-day and a Darwin-day.</p>

<p>Chiffan had glanced at Rud when this suggestion was made.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Norvel hastily, before Rud had time to express
an opinion. "We <i>must</i> keep on the old calendar days, weeks
and months, just as much as we can. They have character. No
substitute for the Semitic week," he said, "has ever yet been
thought out. Maybe it doesn't suit every sort of industry, but
working spells and rest intervals ought to vary with the nature of
the job. Ten days would be just as much a misfit as seven. We're
not going to do the sun and the moon and Thor and Freyja and all
the rest of 'em out of their days of the week, and personally I'd
hate to call the ninth and tenth months anything but September and
October. These are interesting fossils of the mind, and they do no
harm that I can see. They remind us of our intellectual origins.
You'll want to shut our ear-holes next because they come from
primitive gill-slits. I'm all for continuity in unimportant things.
So don't let's start a new era.</p>

<p>"I don't know how it seems to you," Norvel went on, before
anyone else could cut in, "but that Year One of the Republic
business and all that, has always struck me as more than a little
vulgar. It's like calling Petersburg Leningrad. Let the Christians
keep the tale of years and Greenwich the first meridian. After all,
nothing really happened in A.D. one. Even our Dominus wasn't born
until A.D. four."</p>

<p>"No," said Rud, with an eye on Thirp. "No. Of course he wasn't.
We have to recognise that arbitrary unmeaning points like the
Greenwich meridian and A.D. one, <i>are</i> the best for reckoning.
We don't want to prejudice history. The old world tried to put its
propaganda in everything, from eras to postage stamps. The new
world&mdash;I agree with Norvel and Chiffan&mdash;can't do
that."</p>

<p>"I never said anything," said Chiffan.</p>

<p>"I read your thoughts, Chiffan," said Rud.</p>

<p>"It was a mere passing idea," said Thirp, taking his cue.</p>

<p>"And, after all," thought Chiffan, "he <i>is</i> on the money
and the postage stamps..."</p>

<p>In the same spirit the Fundamental Law conference would have
nothing to do with a duodecimal system of numbering. "Leave all
that sort of thing alone," said Norvel. "Who knows how science will
be dealing with sequences and dimensions in the next hundred years?
Our sufficient business is world unity&mdash;with such material as
we possess. Man counts by tens because he has ten fingers. That
trouble began with our amphibious ancestors, I believe, some when
in the Palaeozoic. It's too far to go back."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VII</h3>

<p class="first">Nor would Rud listen to any projects for a World
Language. There he not only followed Norvel and Bodisham, but his
own natural indisposition to tamper with the rhetorical instrument
he had mastered.</p>

<p>They were all three inclined towards a simplified and
phonetically spelt English as the common speech of the world,
because they were English-speakers and because the English-speaking
communities had been the backbone of the revolutionary movement.
But they realised the element of bias in this disposition. They
knew that language was bound to change with all the other changes
in progress, that it needed not merely new words but new idioms,
that the vocabulary of every tongue that remained in use must
inevitably be enormously enlarged and refined, and that the speech
of the future, whatever its basis, would necessarily be syncretic
and greatly polished by attrition. They favoured English so far as
to institute phonetic spelling, make it compulsory to print books
in this reformed orthography and optional to print them also in the
classical alphabet, and establish basic English the official
<i>lingua franca</i>. But they suppressed no other language
teaching. When there was a non-English-speaking population the
local language was the primary one. They felt that in this way a
mutable English speech might be imposed upon the patchwork of
Babel, much as the white saltire unified the world's flags. Useful
and expressive novelties could be incorporated from any other
language and made world-wide by the cinema, the radio and the
ever-multiplying schools. English has always been the Autolycus of
languages, taking its own where it found it. Against this leisurely
advance towards a naturally developing, synthetic, world language,
the Idoists, the Esperantists and their like raged in vain.</p>

<p>"It is remarkable how patriotism still lingers in the blood,"
said Dreed. "I like to think that the coming world language will be
English."</p>

<p>"It will be almost as much English," said Norvel, "as Middle
Saxon is the English in use to-day. Less like. It will have dropped
a thousand ambiguous and deflated terms. It will have received from
every language under the sun. It will probably have new pronouns
and new prepositions. We can no more foresee that than we can
foresee the fashions of five hundred years from now.</p>

<p>"All we can do is to prepare for a universal language that will
go on changing for ever. We don't know everything. We aren't final.
I wish we could make that statement a part of the Fundamental
Law."</p>

<p>"We could work something about that into the exordium," said
Rud. "I think we could make it sound rather fine."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VIII</h3>

<p class="first">On the morning of his forty-fourth birthday Rud
sat down at the head of the table in the place reserved for him,
and regardless of what the Group might be discussing at the moment,
said: "Well, tell me all about it..."</p>

<p>They had come to the position of women in the new world. "We
were saying," said Chiffan, "that women have played a curiously
small part in the Revolution."</p>

<p>"So far as I know," said Rud with conviction, "they haven't
played any part at all. What are you working upon now here?"</p>

<p>"They constitute fifty-seven per cent of the species," said
Chiffan.</p>

<p>"Well, the Fundamental Law provides that there shall be no
discrimination of race, religion, class, sex?"</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," said Bodisham. "Sex?</p>

<p>"We provide," said Bodisham, "that there shall be no legal
disqualification or handicap on account of sex, but that does not
end the matter. First we have to consider that vast mass of human
beings, which is already expanding proportionately again, Norvel's
particular field, the young below the age of citizenship, and next
and linked to that we have certain occasions between man and woman.
How far does the law interfere?"</p>

<p>"As little as possible," said Chiffan.</p>

<p>"In every affair the law must interfere as little as possible.
The Fundamental Law makes that clear."</p>

<p>Norvel spoke. "We have to consider first of all the supply of
children in the world. Sooner or later we may have to forbid
marriage&mdash;no, not marriage, but bearing and begetting&mdash;to
certain definable types. Biological science isn't so sure
yet&mdash;but it will get sure. That is as much a part of the World
Health Service as the compulsory notification of infectious
diseases and the establishment of cordons."</p>

<p>"It will be liable to abuses," said Dreed.</p>

<p>Bodisham raised his eyebrows by way of reply. Every law is
liable to abuses.</p>

<p>"All that sort of thing is pretty straight sailing," said
Chiffan. "There is no dispute about the principles involved. The
real problem is just how far the modern world can
regulate&mdash;embraces."</p>

<p>Rud scowled at him. "That," he said, "is part of the individual
life. There is no need even to talk about it here."</p>

<p>"You think that apart from licensing parenthood and subsidising
motherhood," said Roots, "the state should leave sex alone."</p>

<p>"<i>Embraces</i>," corrected Chiffan, heedless of Rud's
objection. "Embraces! You can't ignore the social aspects of sex,
you can leave the actual embraces alone, but you can't avoid the
social recognition of the groupings that ensue."</p>

<p>"There have always been marital rights," said Dreed, unheeded.
"But were they ever&mdash;enforced?"</p>

<p>"It affects our housing projects, for example," said Chiffan.
"Whom do we embrace and where and when? Are we to build for
monogamy, polygamy, polyandry, promiscuity?..."</p>

<p>"There is no such thing as promiscuity," said Norvel.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;an obliging looseness, let us say. An amiable
laxity. Is this new world ahead to be a world of tight little,
right little homes, or a patriarchal kraal or a sprawl of lovers
against a background of maternity homes and foundling hospitals? I
admit every day and in every way, parentage becomes less
involuntary. It seems to me that this also releases human
affectionateness at a less austere level. Cupid with his bandage
off and armed with a revolver. Still&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That would be a problem for the constructive ministries to
meet, according to the varying local requirements," said Roots.</p>

<p>"It is remarkable," said Dreed, "that we should be sitting here
discussing the future of all womankind on earth, without a single
woman present. Ought we not?"</p>

<p>"We don't want any women here," said Rud. "They would take sides
where we differed, but they would contribute nothing."</p>

<p>"They would demand complete control of the whole business," said
Norvel. "With a certain air of reasonableness they would say it was
their particular business."</p>

<p>"And they would do nothing whatever about it," said Rud. "We
don't want women here. We don't want them."</p>

<p>"Not even to give evidence?" said Norvel.</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> an inquisition!" chuckled Chiffan, manifestly
amused. "I can imagine&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped short at the sight of Rud's scowl.</p>

<p>"I suggest that the Fundamental Law deal with the young and with
any eugenic aspects of the matter, and leave all the rest to the
natural development of social life," said Rud.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," Norvel persisted, "I think we ought to have some
representative women here. We ought either to make a special
committee of them to report and suggest, or bring them into
consultation."</p>

<p>"What <i>are</i> representative women?" demanded Rud, with a
gust of impatience. "What <i>makes</i> them?" And then, as if the
whole question was too trivial for his attention, he pushed back
his chair, rose slowly and departed.</p>

<p>Chiffan watched him go.</p>

<p>"And now?" began Norvel...</p>

<p>"Being a woman so far has been the major profession of the
species," said Roots. "In a few specialised forms it is grossly
overpaid; in nine hundred and ninety-nine cases in the thousand it
has been abominably underpaid. It is not so much a sweated industry
as a bluffed and racketeered one. Being a wife is still the main
profession of women in the world, and yet the financial and
well-disciplinary conditions of two people, married or not, who are
living together, amount generally to a fight for the upper hand. It
is a fight very much out of the cognizance of the law. Most of the
events occur without witnesses, both sides have an age-long
tradition of lying abominably about the other, and at the same time
standing up for each other, and interference between husband and
wife is consequently very difficult.</p>

<p>"But it is only in the intimate life that interference is
difficult. Economically the problem is much simpler. An increasing
number of women are taking up professions now; at architecture,
catering, various industries, normal teaching, secretarial work,
hospital work, for example, they are practically as good as men or
better, and there we need only carry out the principle of absolute
equality. And it seems economically and socially convenient to make
motherhood a paid social service. If that is done and if the
allowances go to the mother, with a reasonable right of the father
and the local authority to intervene in cases of cruelty or
negligence, we shall have put womankind for the first time in
history on a fair and equal footing with men, so far as economic
freedom goes. Nothing need prevent a woman being a man's salaried
housekeeper or his nurse or what not with or without marriage. If
she enters into a form of marriage involving a contract, that
contract will be subject to the laws we shall certainly impose for
the limitation, periodic revision and annulment of unreasonable and
undesirable clauses in all contracts. There the Fundamental Law
stops short. Sexual amour-propre, jealousy, what are called marital
rights and so forth are no concern of the state's. If they lead to
crimes the law deals with the crime. All that seems very
simple."</p>

<p>"The World State, I take it," said Bodisham, "will protect
individual freedom, from conception to cremation. It will protect
individual freedom from menace and monopolisation. It will protect
the young from any premature decisions they will be unable to
reverse. It may also presently set about protecting the young from
diseased or defective parentage. As our knowledge of dysgenic
processes advances. Beyond what is implied by that much protection,
it will leave men and women absolutely free to conduct themselves
as they choose. There lies the scope for a free literature, novels,
dramas, poetry, spectacle, suggestion, inspiration, exaltation of
every sort turning upon conduct and interpretation. There may be
cults. We have to prepare for life in unprecedented profusion and
variety...But the state has to stand aside from all that."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; IX</h3>

<p class="first">"It's curious," began Chiffan, and stopped
short.</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Bodisham, who had a marked tolerance for Chiffan's
excursions.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Chiffan, "that with man just as much as with
any other social animal, sex was the original binding force of the
community, and I suppose our religion, our morality arose mainly
out of sexual subordination and sexual tabus. So the
anthropologists tell us. If perhaps I temper my Freud with Adler,
still all the same I think the main strand of emotional life is
sexual. Maybe fear, hunger and the power-craving are more
elementary than sex, but sex is bound up with most of the
power-craving..."</p>

<p>Norvel nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Well, here we are organising a world first to defeat,
distribute and disperse the power-craving and so end war, and
secondly to secure and distribute abundance to everyone. Good. We
shall do it. What of sex? We are going to release something which
hitherto has been kept under the severest restraint, which hitherto
has been the chief force harnessed by morality, which has been in
fact for most people the significance of morality, the sexual urge
and the sexual imagination. That is, I have to point out, a
complete change of function for the social organisation. Our
Fundamental Law is just bundling the original social force out of
the court room to do what it likes unchallenged..."</p>

<p>"What have you to suggest?" said Bodisham. "Are you suggesting a
control?"</p>

<p>"I am suggesting nothing," said Chiffan. "I am reflecting."
Bodisham began to fiddle with his pencil. He had expected a project
of some sort.</p>

<p>"Sex," Chiffan went on, "is something absolutely primary in this
queer beast, Man. Perhaps I see things with a certain bias, but it
appears to me that when the animal man is neither afraid, nor
hungry, nor exhausted, then it is that the energies within him, the
endocrines, the chemical conspirators that drive him, are turned in
the direction of self-assertion through sex. Concentrated on that
end. Security and abundance release sex. Wherever there is sex to
be released. I think the intimate history of what one might call
emancipated classes in the past&mdash;courts, aristocracies,
plutocracies for example, points in that direction. Sex is
released, exposed and elaborated. Life ceases to be serious.
Gallantry and art break out. Sex lies in wait for every sort of
success. It follows success about. That has always been so, and I
think it is likely to be so always. No Revolution can change
that."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Bodisham. "But how does it affect the
Fundamental Law?"</p>

<p>"I am considering the problem of surplus energy," said Chiffan,
"as an explosive force. I am speculating about what is to happen
when the Common Man begins to realise that the scramble for life is
over for good and all. Our Fundamental Law is ensuring his
permanent immunity from violent termination by explosives,
machinery and insane hatreds and intolerances. But also it is
creating a curious <i>gap</i> in living&mdash;unknown to the adult
life of any other animal&mdash;leisure, active leisure, leisure
with surplus energy...And now, says the animal, what am I to
do?...</p>

<p>"While we were all within a reasonable distance of being shot,
life was eventful and we had no sense of any emptiness in things. A
man with some one in hot pursuit of him was never really bored. But
now, now it is going to be different."</p>

<p>Norvel, with his hands relaxed on the table, considered Chiffan.
Bodisham began to draw little diagrams on his blotting-pad as he
listened. Dreed seemed lost in thoughts of his own, and Roots, who
had to fly back to the Sahara irrigation works before night, turned
to stare out of the great window at the afternoon sky.</p>

<p>"When the pursuit relaxes," Chiffan went on, "then our problem
changes. Two things, I imagine, may happen to a hunted man when the
hunt is over. He may doubt if it is over. He may think that the
hunter is still about, but hiding and creeping&mdash;and he won't
know what to do about that. And that will make him uneasy. And also
the mere fact of having made his escape and won his flight will
also leave him rather at loose ends."</p>

<p>"You mean man in general?" said Norvel.</p>

<p>"Man in particular," said Chiffan. "Perhaps I am talking of
Everyman when in fact I am really thinking of the Common Man who
has come through the Revolution. He is going to feel 'something is
still coming for me and I am doing nothing about it, something is
escaping me and I am doing nothing about that either.' That may
lead to complicated trouble. Trouble for our generation in general
and for us in particular. The World Peace we have won was well
worth living for and dying for. Now we have it, it is nothing. It
is just a danger abolished. We have to go on living."</p>

<p>"Creation and constructive work," said Bodisham. "There is no
end to that."</p>

<p>"Knowledge," said Norvel. "Men are scarcely beginning to explore
life and their own possibilities."</p>

<p>"Common men don't realise that," said Chiffan. "At present,
Norvel. Until you and your colleagues educate them up to that
realisation, it's just as though it wasn't so...Common men, I tell
you, are going to be most damnably bored&mdash;in the years ahead
of us. Men much more than women. Maybe sex is the actual line of
relief. An efflorescence of sex&mdash;and sublimated sex, art,
decoration, music, may be the natural and necessary relief...I
don't know."</p>

<p>He stopped short and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>Bodisham shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I suppose you will draft this section, Bodisham?" said
Norvel.</p>

<p>Bodisham nodded and pushed his scribbled blotting-pad away from
him. Dreed sat up and Roots returned from his contemplation of the
clouds. The session was over...</p>

<p>Norvel spoke to Chiffan as they left the room.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking, very much as you have been thinking," he
said. "I too think&mdash;the Common Man&mdash;in
particular&mdash;in one particular instance&mdash;may be getting
bored&mdash;and I don't know what to do about it."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; X</h3>

<p class="first">Rud returned along the painted corridor to his own
apartments.</p>

<p>He felt irritated by his Fundamental Law conference and he
realised that his irritation was unreasonable. Evidently they had
to discuss women even if they discussed them only to thrust sex out
of the main propositions of the Fundamental Law. But why should
they have chosen that topic on this particular morning? And why had
they not kept it high and austere? It was Chiffan's touch. Why
should Chiffan drag in a word like "embraces", a discomfiting word,
a warm, enervating word.</p>

<p>Hitherto in his strenuous life he had kept these suggestions out
of his imagination, except in those vague phases that come between
sleeping and waking&mdash;and then they were soon disposed of. But
here they were invading the day. Here they were producing something
like a self-betrayal to his colleagues. Here they were with a plain
intimation that he might forget himself...</p>

<p>He fretted about his apartment for a time. His mind seemed to
have lost all its discipline. What had he to do with embraces? Damn
that word! He decided that he needed to refresh his sense of the
mighty r&ocirc;le that he was playing in the world, to get things back
into proportion. In fact he went to look for himself. He made his
way over an arcaded bridge that spanned a gorge to the series of
offices in which the development of his personality was in
progress, and there he found Quinlan ready to refresh his
memory.</p>

<p>"And how am I getting on with humanity to-day?" asked Rud.</p>

<p>Quinlan showed him a vast pile of photographs, papers, trial
records and beflagged world maps of the birthday celebrations.</p>

<p>"It is amusing to think that no religion has ever had this
universality. Never has Christmas for example ever been celebrated
as your birthday is being celebrated."</p>

<p>A gleam of satisfaction appeared upon Rud's pale face. "I
suppose not," he said. "I suppose not."</p>

<p>Then came a twinge of modesty. "Of course it is all this new
apparatus. It is just the new scale of things that makes it more
universal."</p>

<p>"But so it is," said Quinlan. "None the less."</p>

<p>Rud looked at the methodical assemblage of Quinlan's publicity
machinery. He felt as if he was standing on stilts a mile high. It
was perfectly right, reasonable, fantastic and mad. Alexander,
Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler, had anticipated this sort of thing, but
never had the significance of their elevation been brought home to
them to quite this extent. The stilts seemed steady enough, but the
perspective was terrific.</p>

<p>"We have some new schoolroom cartoons," said Quinlan. "They hit
reaction hard."</p>

<p>Conspicuous in this display was a cartoon of a mighty winged
figure with the face of Rud, idealised and yet recognisable, and in
his hands was a drawn sword. He defended the world against a
squirming mass of necks and heads, bearing crosses, mitres, crowns,
red caps, Federalist shakos; all the symbols of the principalities
and powers of the pre-Revolutionary world.</p>

<p>"Of course, this is an immense exaggeration," said Rud. "I
suppose that in a way it is necessary."</p>

<p>"It is no exaggeration. Maybe it symbolises. It is a symbolical
statement. It is the only way in which we can get the Revolution
over to ninety-nine per cent of them. This&mdash;for the run of
mankind&mdash;is what you are."</p>

<p>"After all," said Rud, searching in his mind for ideas that were
fading away from him. "It is their own collective self..."</p>

<p>Quinlan was too busy with his display to discuss
meta-politics.</p>

<p>"There will be much to tell you to-morrow," he said, "as the
reports and pictures of all that come in and are analysed...</p>

<p>"Of course, if you would like to see something of what is
actually happening now, for example&mdash;" He considered the
buttons before him and decided: "<i>Here</i>."</p>

<p>He motioned Rud's eyes to the screen. It lit up and an elfin
clamour of cheering voices became audible. "This is Pekin," he
said. "They are celebrating you. Look at them."</p>

<p>The crowd was just a waving stipple of faces, an undulating
close-spotted snake's skin. It bustled with banners bearing
inscriptions, in the new Chinese alphabet. Save for faint floating
iridescences it was as real as direct vision. Everyone was singing
some sort of shrill song to pseudo-oriental music.</p>

<p>"Here you can see them quite closely," said Quinlan.</p>

<p>And suddenly almost within touching distance were flushed faces
and bright eyes, and mouths that shouted his name. Mostly they were
quite young girls and their excitement poured out upon him.</p>

<p>"That's enough," said the World Trustee abruptly, and turned
away.</p>

<p>The apparatus clicked and was still.</p>

<p>"All over the world," said Quinlan.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Rud, dismissing him, and went out through a
further arch that opened upon a rock garden. He strolled slowly up
a winding path with occasional steps, and came to a pavilion in
which he seated himself. "All over the world," he repeated. "And
here I am&mdash;solitary."</p>

<p>"All over the world."</p>

<p>He had never thought of his home for years&mdash;he had indeed
deliberately not thought of it. Now he imagined that forgotten
family of his joining in the world chorus. Would they realise that
this great Rud was indeed their&mdash;Rudie? And then, thrusting
all the rest of them out of the way, came his vehement little
cousin Rachel. He had slapped her and she had slapped back and then
he had pulled her soft abundant hair and they had scuffled. It all
came back to him intensified. He saw and felt her face very vividly
close to his. She was gripping his wrists, she was putting out her
sharp red tongue at him and saying "Yaaaa" at him. Was she still
somewhere in this conquered world, marvelling at him? He hoped she
was still in the world. He would like to feel he had got square
with her.</p>

<p>What had become of her? What would she be like now?</p>

<p>Queer, but she must be, she was, the only girl he had ever come
to grips with. He had never seen her since. Her mother took her
abroad, to South Africa was it? Or Australia. And after that slowly
he had become aware of his Destiny. Slowly his Destiny had
enveloped him, absorbed him.</p>

<p>He imagined Cousin Rachel was sitting beside him and that he was
talking to her about the intervening years.</p>

<p>"In a way I have done my task too well. I stand over the world
like that mighty archangel you may have seen out there, the
Guardian of the Revolution. I am frozen in the same attitude. On
guard against any reaction. But I am not really frozen through. I
am not really a mighty archangel. Not altogether. I am something
more. I am a living man&mdash;most terribly alone..."</p>

<p>(What was that book Norvel spoke about? <i>The Golden Bough</i>
and sacrificial kings? I must read it.)</p>

<p>"You are wonderful," said Cousin Rachel, sitting beside him in
his imagination and speaking very softly.</p>

<p>"Sacrificial king of the world. For whom no sacrifice could be
too great, my Master."</p>

<p>Rud started at the extravagance of his own thought and looked
round guiltily for fear that some one might have observed what he
was thinking. Cousin Rachel had evaporated. His haunting fear of
self-betrayal occupied his mind again. This sense of an
ever-watching eye in the open spaces cancelled, as it so often did,
the ease of his Atheism. He sat up and then let himself droop into
a pensive pose as who should think thoughts for all the world.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XI</h3>

<p class="first">Chiffan was the least administrative of all the
Group out of which the first World Administration grew. He remained
what used to be called a Minister without Portfolio. He joined in
the irregular councils that Rud assembled and on increasingly
infrequent occasions he talked to Rud and Rud annexed his ideas.
But the great World Ministries were developing their own methods of
dealing with one another, and the new conjoint sessions of the Law,
Education and Biological (Health) Boards were acting as an organ
for arbitration and taking more and more responsibility off the
shoulders of the council. Rud maintained his closest relations with
the World Police under Thirp and the rather ill-defined Ministry
for the Protection of the World State, and Chiffan, with his
generous salary as consultant-general, was as near an approach to
the old-fashioned "independent gentleman" as the new world could
show. He spent his days in appreciative living and leisurely
writing. With the rapid increase of the world's wealth, a new
leisure class of released and superannuated workers was appearing.
There were more gentlefolk than ever, and more and more. The normal
life labour contribution was now twenty-five thousand hours; there
was already great freedom in the way this could be distributed over
the lifetime, and it ensured a comfortable minimum existence
throughout life. Above that level, there was a great variety of
rewards and fortunes to be earned by competent contributions to
what was called the surplus of life.</p>

<p>Chiffan lived in a pleasant villa in the Rhone Valley, ten
minutes' flying from the Centre, and there he lived with the most
intelligent and congenial of all the women he had ever met, his
wife, Phoebe Chiffan, who was indeed the twenty-ninth "real
mistress" of his philandering career. Their mutual affection was as
manifest as their mutual tolerance, and though she was, as people
say, "faithful" to him, she viewed his active and imaginative
interest in the whole spectacle of womankind with an amused
sympathy. The only person in the world about whom she felt a twinge
of jealousy was Rud. She felt Rud was a monster, she thought his
leadership of the Group uncanny. When she saw that Chiffan was
troubled in his mind and asked him point-blank what he was worrying
about, and when he said "I'm bothered a bit over Rud," she said "I
thought as much."</p>

<p>"You are stupid about Rud," he said.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;you are."</p>

<p>"He's getting into a&mdash;a state of lonely misery."</p>

<p>"Isn't that his own affair?"</p>

<p>"You're inhuman."</p>

<p>"I'm feminine."</p>

<p>"I owe everything to him."</p>

<p>"And he to you. It's fifty-fifty."</p>

<p>"I've got a sort of maternal feeling about him. I've known
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Four times as long as you have known me. What right has a man
to be maternal?"</p>

<p>"Men are&mdash;and even some women."</p>

<p>She leant out of the hammock and pulled his hair. "All right,
Chiff-chaff," she said. "Tell me about your Rud."</p>

<p>"What I&mdash;what we have always liked about him," said
Chiffan, "is a sort of diabolical energy. His drive. There is
something outrageous in his make-up that won us all. And something
that still intrigues me. There are times when I want to follow that
man about like a child following a circus show. <i>Why</i> does he
do things? He's an abject coward&mdash;these are things not to be
repeated, my dear&mdash;and also he is a desperate fighter. Do you
know I think at times that he is the master of the world to-day
simply because he has a frantic fear of power&mdash;in the hands of
anyone else."</p>

<p>She ruffled Chiffan's hair by way of showing she was
listening.</p>

<p>"So he has got it all into his own hands," she said.</p>

<p>"And he doesn't know what to do with it, and now he doesn't know
what to do with himself."</p>

<p>"But isn't he putting the world in order at a tremendous rate?
Everybody says so."</p>

<p>"No. <i>We</i> are. At least, the others are. All that he does
is to watch&mdash;and make that keyhole Minister of his, Thirp,
watch&mdash;that nobody anywhere turns any official authority
conceded him, into power. And Thirp&mdash;well, Thirp bothers him
with suspicions. Things are going well with the world, but unless
they go a little wrong, what is the use of Thirp? Thirp sees to
that. Thirp keeps him irritated and uneasy and he has no
distractions. I'm sorry, darling Phoebe&mdash;you know I love you,
you know how I love you&mdash;but I don't want my ugly little
Thunder-god to culminate in misery. He has made the whole spectacle
of life rich and ridiculous for me. And now he is&mdash;he has a
sort of greyness. He is bored or angry or afraid&mdash;afraid of
things coming back&mdash;all day, and at night they give him
drugs&mdash;and the best of drugs lower one and give one dreams. I
know he has dreams. I didn't think things would take this turn with
him and it distresses me. It distresses <i>me</i>, my dear. Love
me, love my Rud, Phoebe. I did a lot to make him what he is. You
help me with Rud."</p>

<p>"How can I help?"</p>

<p>"Advice. The wisdom of your sex. Give me ideas what to do for
him. You are all born with a natural interest in us. You are twenty
years younger than I, and all the ages wiser."</p>

<p>"It is good for men to have such beliefs," said Phoebe. "But you
must tell me first what you think, and then I will tell you just
how right you are."</p>

<p>"That may be the way of it," said Chiffan.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I said Rud has been driven by fear. He has been driven by an
extreme dread of domination. He cannot endure the thought of anyone
having domination over him. Until he became World Director he never
felt safe about that. He needs constant reassurance still. That is
plain enough even for <i>you</i> to see, my dear."</p>

<p>"Did you say just now that I was all the ages wiser than
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. When things are put before you. But what I have only
glimpsed by fits and starts about him&mdash;until quite
recently&mdash;is something else. Rud, I realise, has a profound,
maybe innate dread of the closest of all forms of
domination&mdash;love."</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"His capacity for love&mdash;if he ever had much capacity for
love&mdash;has atrophied. Or you can put it, if you like, in quite
another way. It has vanished and then returned in a vague, cloudy
desire to be appreciated, admired, obeyed&mdash;loved by all the
world. Without any return. All this accumulating desire for public
adoration, all this increasing exhibitionism&mdash;"</p>

<p>He thought profoundly.</p>

<p>"You see, Phoebe, you and I <i>assuage</i> each other's
egotisms. To a very considerable extent. Unless they get wasted, or
crippled or perverted in some way, men and women get together as
you and I have got together at last...We get a domination over one
another. And so long as things seem fair and equal we don't resent
that. We begin with liking and love-making&mdash;yes, we keep on
with love-making&mdash;but the chemistry of body and mind works so
as to give us a control over each other's self-respect...That's the
sane way of life. For anyone with a rational imagination. When a
man is happy with his woman and a woman is happy with her man and
they are happy in their friends, neither of them aches&mdash;as he
does&mdash;to possess the world and the sun and the moon. Am I
right?"</p>

<p>"Sweetheart, you are right. Though it took you some years of
sedulous research&mdash;"</p>

<p>Chiffan waved aside what threatened to be a troublesome
digression. "You kept out of my way," he said. "The point about
Rud, Phoebe, is just what you have said to me. There is nobody in
the world to say to him 'Sweetheart, you are right.'"</p>

<p>"And that aches?"</p>

<p>"Damnably. It is the fundamental ache. The better you are fed
and clothed and gratified, the more that ache for reassuring
appreciation takes hold of you. The core of happiness is to have
some one with whom you are essentially right and
important&mdash;however wrong and ineffective you are. Rud hasn't
loved, doesn't love and doesn't know how to love."</p>

<p>"Now <i>why?</i>" said Phoebe, with her chin between her two
fists.</p>

<p>"Missed it."</p>

<p>"You don't mean he's homosexual?"</p>

<p>"No. Not a bit of it. And besides, I'm told, <i>they</i> can be
quite affectionate."</p>

<p>"Asexual?"</p>

<p>"Nobody is."</p>

<p>"Then, what?"</p>

<p>"I said that his ruling motive is dread. Something happened.
Something humiliating. Quite early perhaps. But something that
turned him back upon himself."</p>

<p>"Narcissism."</p>

<p>"If you like to call it that. A trifle too floral for my taste.
We want a third word; there's homosexual and heterosexual&mdash;why
not autosexual? He is afraid of women. He dare not risk an approach
to them. He is afraid of humiliation, he is darkened by a dread of
them. And, my dear, dimly, he wants what you give us. He missed the
coarse enterprise of adolescence, which lays the foundations of
confidence. He feels now that that triumph&mdash;it is a triumph,
Phoebe&mdash;is not for him, and so he has trained himself not to
attempt, not to betray a flicker of desire."</p>

<p>"Queer creatures we humans are!"</p>

<p>"Am I right? Can you imagine him as a lover?"</p>

<p>"Ugh!"</p>

<p>"For any woman?"</p>

<p>"Women are queer things. Not all alike. More variable perhaps
than men in these things. I can't put myself&mdash;can't imagine
myself&mdash;in any woman's skin but my own. There is a brutal
fastidiousness in <i>my</i> physical make-up anyhow. Let alone that
I love you, so that I'm specialised now for you. But before ever I
met you I am certain he would have seemed not simply indifferent,
but repulsive&mdash;disgusting."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Chiffan, "how far you speak for even a majority
of women?"</p>

<p>"Any woman who answers for the behaviour of any woman but
herself is a fool," said Phoebe.</p>

<p>"But even as what they used to call a Platonic lover?"</p>

<p>"Some women seem capable of monstrous tolerations. You and I are
imaginative, sensuous people. We can't stand people who are not
good-looking. We are a normal easygoing couple. There are women
without sensory imaginations, without physical pride, gross women,
acquisitive women, prestige-lovers, women with a sort of blunt,
savage brutality of ownership...But go on."</p>

<p>"Well, you will see now what I mean when I say that Rud is
living in an unbroken egotism, all inside himself. A sort of moral
potbound plant. Love is the natural force that breaks down egotism,
takes you out to living, to personal self-forgetfulness, but he has
never had even a sentimental relationship. He had no intimate life,
no life of the affections, at all; and so his egotism now has
become inflamed and dreadful."</p>

<p>"But what am <i>I</i> to do about it?"</p>

<p>"Help me to do something to break down his loneliness."</p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<p>"Make some sort of social life for him. Get him into contact
with human beings, easy, delightful, everyday human beings."</p>

<p>"But how? And where?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how. That is why I come to you. Social life is
woman's work. He distresses me, I tell you. In a way, Phoebe, I
love him. He's been a great fact in my life. And I can't think what
to do about it. There he is away there, either working or alone.
I've been watching him. Things are getting urgent."</p>

<p>Phoebe swung down out of the hammock and confronted Chiffan.</p>

<p>"You darling," she said. "<i>You</i> broke out of <i>your</i>
egotism quite early in life. You tore it to rags. I suppose you've
always been breaking out of your egotism in all
directions&mdash;when did you begin, dear? I never thought being a
rake was a synonym for altruism. Bless you&mdash;I don't
mind&mdash;as long as you don't dwell on it. I'm glad you've loved
so many people. I will think of something&mdash;somehow. You've
made me do some difficult things. But this&mdash;what shall I call
it?&mdash;rehumanising of the Master Director!"</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XII</h3>

<p class="first">"Rehumanising the Master Director" seemed a good
phrase to Chiffan. Phoebe was learning the trick of phrase-making
from him, as women will acquire even the most recondite tricks from
their men, and he had that impulse to quote her cleverness which is
part of the pride of love. The change in Rud's moods and manners
was attracting the attention not only of Chiffan, but of most of
those who were in any sort of personal contact with him, and he was
being observed and discussed as he never had been
before&mdash;intimately. The thing was leaking out towards the
public mind. And Thirp was not one of the least active of those who
speculated about the Master's disposition. He caught up Mrs.
Chiffan's phrase with approval.</p>

<p>"Of course!" he said, in his high-pitched voice. "How clever of
that young woman! No human being can keep going as he has kept
going for the last ten years without <i>some</i> relaxation. Worse
than a term of imprisonment. He needs distraction sorely.</p>

<p>"Everyone says he needs rest," said Thirp, "but rest isn't a
negative thing. It is no sort of rest to do nothing. Prisoners have
told me that. The best mental rest is a change of preoccupation.
For&mdash;I don't know how long&mdash;he has had no&mdash;what
shall I call it?&mdash;no personal life. All that side of his life
has been inhibited. Queer I didn't realise this before!"</p>

<p>Thirp's mind went off at a tangent from that.</p>

<p>Thirp was certainly the most incongruous of all the Central
Group, the least constructive in spirit and perhaps the most
active. There was something about the motions of his hands and
about the passing raptures on his face that made Norvel, who
disliked him thoroughly, think that he ought to have been an
old-world dealer in scents or sweets or precious stones. He was
always astonishing Norvel by the extraordinary penetration of his
occasional comments and by his barely concealed indifference to the
vast conception of social reconstruction throughout the whole world
which dominated the rest of the Group. He lifted his eyebrows, he
lifted his voice in a slightly derisive appreciation of the
reconditioned world about him. He intimated that he felt it was too
good and much too rapid to be true. There was none of the
hive-builder, nothing of the beaver about Thirp; his constructions
were webs.</p>

<p>He went to and fro in the world, always a little secretly and
unexpectedly, and his friends were mostly the younger men of his
organisation, agents he used and somehow had to protect, and a
certain sprinkling of accidental womenfolk. His taste in atmosphere
was for variety, contrast, richness and the recondite. He had an
instinct for the out-of-the-way. He would spend a few days in some
Chinese household that had miraculously survived the social
convulsions of the age, or he would stay for a week in some remote
monastery or lamasery that the tides of destruction had left
untouched, or he would go to his own villa among a group of
artistic friends, near Montserrat in Catalonia, and return with
renewed zest to the control of his immense organisation of
information bureaus and the obscure activities of his Ministry for
the Preservation of the Revolution.</p>

<p>This last was the most ill-defined of all the World
Administrations. It was in effect a political police which had
grown up about Thirp as a centre. It had its prisons and its
oubliettes&mdash;often prisons taken over from the old order and
very incompletely modernised. It watched for an anticipated
militant reaction, and particularly for any systematic attempts to
revive nationalist feeling or race antagonism, it was as underhand
as the evils it attacked, it was suspicious in spirit and its
methods secret and arbitrary. It was all in his hands, and Rud was
as insistent to keep it entirely in his hands as he had been to
maintain Bellacourt's independence of Reedly.</p>

<p>"You honest men don't know anything about treason," he said to
Bodisham. "You must set an intriguer to deal with intrigue."</p>

<p>Bodisham said something about universal fair-play nowadays.</p>

<p>"Sedition," said Rud, "knows nothing of fair-play."</p>

<p>Rud surprised Norvel one day by telling him of a rather acid
comment upon Quinlan's St. Michael poster he had made at a private
dinner party.</p>

<p>"Good God!" said Norvel indignantly. "Do we still live in a
world of political espionage?"</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> do," said Rud.</p>

<p>Chiffan's phrase about "rehumanisation" set not simply one train
of ideas but two separate systems going in Thirp's busy brain. One
was the rehumanisation of world affairs through what he called "the
reappearance of women", and the second was the imperative necessity
for him that any personal "rehumanisation" of Rud must be in his
own hands, if his present influence in world affairs was to be
maintained. Whatever happened, Chiffan was not to rehumanise
Rud.</p>

<p>"The reappearance of women", he expounded to two or three of his
leading agents in the Arab dining-room of his chambers at the
police headquarters.</p>

<p>"In war and during the turnover of revolutions, women have a way
of disappearing from the centre of the human stage. They are just
blacked out. They are shapes in the background. They nurse, they
supply the rough material for outrages, they do a lot of
love-making, but in a hurry, unimportantly, as the inferior
partner. There is espionage&mdash;but the popular mind exaggerates
about the beautiful spy&mdash;and they work in munition factories
and act as substitute men, clerking, driving cars and inspecting
tickets. It's all minor r&ocirc;les they have. But now as things are
getting into shape again, as the tension of conflict relaxes, you
see them coming back not merely to equality, but to a special sort
of power and predominance. They are less and less wanted for jobs;
they are more and more wanted for their pretty selves. Beauty
becomes significant again, important in itself; they dress, they
make-up. 'Society' life is resumed. Men compete again for their
approval and their favour...I have never set much store upon the
achievement of women myself," said Thirp, "but I admit they are
becoming now as interesting as they have ever been...</p>

<p>"Even though the World War left more of them alive than
men...</p>

<p>"All over the world, I observe, social occasions are arising and
women are becoming self-conscious again. The way the pretty
creatures begin to dress&mdash;and undress! Oh! I suppose we shall
never see the kind of entertainment there used to be in the great
private houses of the past, huge gatherings coloured by the
personality of a monarch or a merchant prince, but with the
increase of wealth that is going on there is sure to be a
tremendous development of large public assemblies where everyone
can see and be seen. On any sort of excuse. Dancing is spreading
and parades and pageants.</p>

<p>"Dress, I remark, is already extravagant, but some of it, I
admit, is lovely. It's funny how men too are beginning to dress up
again. These new community centres that are replacing the old
schools everywhere are becoming social centres and adding assembly
rooms&mdash;oh! palaces we should have thought
them&mdash;everywhere. As fast as they can run them up. It makes
all that one remembers of the old world seem grey and cheap and
shabby already. I thought we were going to have a plague of
unemployed artists and decorators, but it seems there aren't enough
to go round. The world is swarming with wandering painters and
jewellers and singers. And&mdash;I don't know what to call
them&mdash;these itinerant lovers. Queer people, they
are&mdash;very.</p>

<p>"Mere boys and girls now work like devils for a year or so and
then go off round the world to spend the money and leisure they
have earned. Not a frontier, not so much as a toll-gate to hinder
them. We've had the world peace established for hardly three years
yet and already we are keeping holiday and holding a fair. It's a
peace carnival. People who were dodging bombs and hiding in
shelters only three years ago. No end of these handsome young
fellows we see at play everywhere have worn uniforms and clicked
their heels and been in the trenches. Everywhere you go now you see
the Trustee's picture; he's on the money, he's on the notices in
the streets, and he looks well and hearty everywhere&mdash;except
when you see him himself. And he's&mdash;he's bored. He's bored and
uneasy. I've been told that he dreams. He cries out in his sleep. I
have it on good authority. It's my business to know things...</p>

<p>"What I am saying I wouldn't say to everyone, my dear Horatio,
but the World Revolution which has been such a blessed reality for
hundreds of millions of people, has been a sort of joke played upon
him. For him it isn't real. He's hoisted up&mdash;right out of it.
He's become&mdash;" He took a quarter out of his pocket and showed
the ennobled visage on it&mdash;"<i>this</i>...He may end by hating
the sight of himself.</p>

<p>"The strain of the Revolution went on so long that it has left
him with a dread of a return. He <i>will</i> look back. He seems
incapable of sharing the general gladness. If only I knew
how&mdash;if only we could contrive..."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XIII</h3>

<p class="first">Thirp and Chiffan competed in the rehumanisation
of Rud, and Thirp won easily. Mr. and Mrs. Chiffan entertained Rud
once and he would not come again. He appeared a little
distrustfully among the "easy, delightful, everyday human beings"
she had assembled for his entertainment. He brightened for a moment
when she took his hand and smiled at him, and then darkened when he
saw her exchange a glance with her husband. He was definitely
clumsy with the other women. They were a little at a loss for
something to say to him, and he gave them no help.</p>

<p>He became less and less responsive as the evening wore on. His
mute demand, Why the devil had they got him there? became
insistent. He made a premature retreat and left the little
gathering in a state of unwonted dismay at its own
unattractiveness. It occurred to Chiffan then, that never in his
life had he ever known Rud to indulge in general conversation. Even
at the Steenhold flat he had either sulked in his corner under his
caricature or broken out into monologue. But there had been no
luring him into monologue that evening. In the old days his one
topic had been the coming Revolution, and now the Revolution had
come he was tongue-tied.</p>

<p>One young woman tried to interest him in her bracelets and
necklaces of fire-opal set in silver. They seemed to be old, but
she could not find out where they had been made. Opals were
supposed to be unlucky. Rud looked at them with an effect of not
looking at the neck and arms that wore them. "Thirp," was his sole
comment, "could tell you all about them. <i>He's</i> interested in
that sort of thing."</p>

<p>Rud indisputably was not.</p>

<p>He went early and yet it seemed to Phoebe that he went
reluctantly. She felt, as she told Chiffan afterwards, that if
things had been different and there had been different people and
he had been different, he would have liked to stay for quite a long
time.</p>

<p>"He went away slowly," said Phoebe, "with an air of going off to
something worse."</p>

<p>Thirp took a different line with him altogether. He set about
entertaining the World Trustee with inferiors and performers. He
did not invite him formally, but one evening when they had some
minor matter to discuss, he asked Rud to come to him because, he
said, he was treating himself to a show. Rud was difficult to
entertain because of his habitual abstemiousness, but Thirp induced
him to eat a cheese dish he had had prepared for him specially and
drink some fine Burgundy, and then he produced his show. He had
discovered a little round-faced, round-eyed, yellow and black,
exceedingly impudent, Siamese girl conjurer. She had a great sense
of humour and some excellent tricks, and very soon she had Rud at
his ease and laughing. Then came a dance of masked Siamese girls to
a lilting Westernised tune which also took Rud's fancy, so that
presently he was beating time.</p>

<p>"He likes them funny and he likes them little and he likes them
young," Thirp noted. "The smaller and the younger and the more
weakly impudent they are, the less he is afraid."</p>

<p>That was enough for the present, thought Thirp, but at the end
of the evening he told Rud he often had little shows of this sort.
He felt it well to keep in touch with the amusements of the people.
If Rud would care to come again&mdash;</p>

<p>Rud was not unwilling to come again. "Relaxation," said
Thirp.</p>

<p>"I liked that little conjuring thing," said Rud. "She made me
laugh&mdash;and somehow I seem to have got out of the habit of
laughing."</p>

<p>Thirp repeated this entertainment, but without undue alacrity.
This time two wriggling Japanese maidens served the dishes for
Rud's austerely excellent meal.</p>

<p>Four or five times was Rud Thirp's appreciative guest, and then
it seemed time for Thirp to&mdash;to use his own
phrase&mdash;"arrange a little <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>"? That demanded
thought and preparation. He talked to Rud of health and fatigue,
amusement and rest, and of the extraordinary sleep-provoking power
of massage. At first Rud seemed as likely to expose his bare skin
to the mauling and pinching of massage as to dance naked in a
market-place. His accumulated modesty barred the way. Then by a
well-arranged accident he was given a glimpse of the infantile but
appetising charm of Miss Chubby Fielder, and a little later, when
he was in a phase of neurasthenic discomfort, Thirp persuaded him
to give her an opportunity...</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XIV</h3>

<p class="first">"It isn't my fault," said Chubby Fielder. "It
isn't my fault. I tried everything.</p>

<p>"I wish there were nunneries. I must go away from this. I must
hide. He got so <i>angry</i>...</p>

<p>"If ever I take a lover the Master will kill me."</p>

<p>"But He didn't say that!"</p>

<p>"No. He didn't <i>say</i> it. But he was so <i>upset!</i> He was
<i>so</i> upset. At having forgotten himself. <i>That's</i> what
upset him. All crying and then furious. Overbearing and then kind
of ashamed of himself and then ashamed of me. 'I'd like to wipe you
out of existence,' he said. He said that. Suppose he meant that!
And then he kissed me and kind of threw me away from him.
<i>I'm</i> terrified. How can I get out of this? Where can I go,
Mr. Thirp?"</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, Chubby, my dear," said Thirp, and made a sort
of dabbing pat at her bare shoulder as if to reassure her. "If
necessary you shall vanish. I'll just smuggle you away. Though I
doubt if I'll have to do that. But, mind you, never talk about
this. Never say a word and you will be safe. But if ever he thinks
you have told on him, even as little as you have told me, I can't
answer for it."</p>

<p>"But what have I told you? It isn't anything&mdash;it's what I
feel. I haven't said a thing. Not actually. <i>Have</i> I said
anything?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I've said nothing. Practically it <i>was</i> nothing."</p>

<p>"It's just how much it was nothing&mdash;that you mustn't tell
anyone," said Thirp. "If you talk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is it likely?" said Chubby.</p>

<p>"If you don't talk, Chubby. If he believes you haven't talked.
If you keep everything there was between you, between
you&mdash;even from me. Maybe&mdash;I can't promise, mind
you&mdash;but maybe he will see you again..."</p>

<p>"Bert&mdash;" began Chubby, which was her way of saying
"But."</p>

<p>"Yes, Chubby," said Thirp. "Quite possibly. If you are silent
and discreet. Very discreet. "And if ever you find yourself with
him again, Chubby," said Thirp. "Say this to him; say&mdash;'You
are God.'"</p>

<p>Chubby repeated that in a whisper.</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"He'll like it."</p>

<p>"I shan't ever be with him again," she said, "so what's the
good?..."</p>

<p>Rud did see her again, but all that happened between them was
wrapped in mystery even from Thirp. Quite possibly little or
nothing happened between them. <i>Honi soit qui mal y pense</i>.
And Chiffan to the end of his life never even knew that there was
such a person as Chubby, much less how much more pleasant the
company of a being like Chubby could be to the unlimited,
fear-haunted egotism of Rud than that of any fully-grown,
level-spirited woman.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XV</h3>

<p class="first">So much of Rud's intimate life has to be told and
discussed to make the picture of him complete, but beyond that
there is hardly anything significant to tell. For the rest we can
emulate Chubby's discretion. The significance of what has been told
is its insignificance. One or two other feminine figures flicker on
to the record, but they were mere passing incidents. There was the
lady who professed to be able to induce dreamless sleep by mesmeric
passes. She appeared, dark, handsome and impressive, betraying a
beautiful blue-veined marble throat, waving large white hands. From
the outset Thirp distrusted her, he felt she might have the makings
of a female Rasputin in the world autocracy; nevertheless, since it
was in Thirp's scheme of things that Rud should continue to be
concerned about his insomnia, she was given access to him.
Something happened. She emerged from Rud's private apartments with
a scared expression on her handsome face and nothing portentous
left about her.</p>

<p>"Not a success," she said to Thirp, pushing past him. "Not at
all a success."</p>

<p>Then Rud: "That disgusting woman! Never let me see her
again."</p>

<p>Lady Susannah Shakespeare, that splendid golden blonde, the
perfect woman, Flaming Susannah, Susannah the Terror of her Elders,
as she was known among her intimates, was outstanding among those
who would have conferred fatherhood upon the Master of the World.
Her pursuit of Rud was open and shameless, and she fought her way
at least to the presence of Thirp.</p>

<p>But Thirp was strangely discouraging.</p>

<p>She had met Thirp for the first time, and she found him
antipathetic. He was so much more feminine in an elderly sort of
way than herself. "You know," he said, "if you go on as you are
doing, it might be felt you were making him a little ridiculous.
None of us would like that, Lady Susannah. The Secret Police, I'm
credibly informed, might not like it. <i>Indeed</i>, they might
not. If you go on as you are doing.</p>

<p>"I think," said Thirp, in a tone of profound meditation, "I
think you'd better not. I really think you'd better not. I think
you'd better not even talk any more about your idea."</p>

<p>And it suddenly entered into the mind of the perfect woman that
she had better not.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XVI</h3>

<p class="first">About this time a woman interviewer made a great
scoop by discovering the Master Director's Aunt Julia and getting
access through her to Mrs. Whitlow. "A great man," said the woman
interviewer, "owes everything to his mother."</p>

<p>"Never did I know anyone so simple, so <i>direct-minded</i>, as
Rudolf," said old Aunt Julia. "I was always very, very fond of him.
There was something enchanting about him. A naturalness. A
straightforwardness, I should say he is the one single human being
I have ever known entirely free from any complex. He went straight
to his point, whatever it was, like an arrow."</p>

<p>"He was a strange, thoughtful boy," said Mrs. Whitlow, when at
last the woman interviewer had got past Aunt Julia. "I would
wonder&mdash;I would ask myself&mdash;what is he brooding about? He
was aloof among his playmates, communing with himself. His soul was
like a star and dwelt apart. Sometimes he would ask questions that
it puzzled even me to answer. When he was still only a little
fellow of five or six."</p>

<p>The woman interviewer's thoughts flitted for a moment, and in
all reverence, towards another mother in ancient Nazareth. She
wondered if in this case there had been any sort of Annunciation.
But that was difficult to ask. "You felt he was a child of
Destiny?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He had that <i>something</i>," said Mrs. Whitlow.</p>

<p>"He puzzled his poor father," said Mrs. Whitlow. "His father
never understood him."</p>

<p>"Mother fixation," said the woman interviewer. "They say he has
never cared for any woman but you."</p>

<p>"He's had so much to think about," said Mrs. Whitlow,
modestly.</p>

<p>It occurred to Rud, when he read this, that it would be a
natural and popular thing for her to visit him. He had hardly given
her a thought for years. A mother fixation might not be a bad thing
to have. And it might be still more gracious to entertain Alf and
Sam...They'd open their eyes. He would conspicuously do nothing for
them. So that there would be no talk of nepotism. Would Alf turn
out to be as religious as ever? Sam would be frankly envious and
spiteful, but Alf's behaviour was more uncertain. He got Thirp to
make enquiries.</p>

<p>"He has got rather fat, he is a minor distributive official, and
he thinks you are anti-Christ...You know that Neo-Catholic
idea?"</p>

<p>Rud decided not to rediscover Alf.</p>

<p>But he made a large public visit to his mother and talked to her
of what the world owed to her for what she had done to him, and she
said he hadn't changed in the least, he reminded her of how he used
to come home and tell her he was top of the class at school; he had
just the same eager, boyish expression. How happy it used to make
her!</p>

<p>She talked of some new mind cure for her nervous dyspepsia, and
he told her that every specialist in the world was absolutely at
her disposal.</p>

<p>She spoke of various neighbours of their early days. She did not
know what had become of his cousin, Rachel. She had lost sight of
her after her husband's sister died in Australia.</p>

<p>"Do you still have those sick headaches, Rudie?" she asked.
"Always so suffering and so patient you were..."</p>

<h2><a id="chap4_02" name="chap4_02"></a>II. &mdash; THE GOD
CAESAR</h2>

<h3>&sect; I</h3>

<p class="first">Because of the effective control of the press
exercised by the World Directorate during the period of world
readaptation, people at large heard practically nothing about this
physio-psychological eddy in which the Master Director was
spinning. Only some years later did vague rumours of it become
current. They did not know that he gave way now to long spells of
indolence with occasional interludes of relaxation under the
complaisant management of Thirp. The world as a whole believed him
to be the active administrator, as sexless as a modern God, who
was, with a certain peremptoriness, but unquestionable rightness
and ability, putting the world's affairs into a more rational and
happier frame than they had ever been in before. They understood
that he lived a simple, strenuous and very secluded life, in the
performance of his great task. For them it was Rud's peace that
ruled in the world.</p>

<p>And for a span of fruitful years the rational reconstruction of
human organisations, boldly scrapping traditional entanglements and
boldly tackling difficulties that hitherto had seemed
insurmountable, went on swiftly and without any conspicuous
disturbance. The diffused liberal thought of nearly a century of
ineffective years was being given a scientific form and a
scientific application. It was a process parallel to that
discursive multiplication of ideas about electricity that went on
before the eighties of the nineteenth century and the swift onset
of the electrical age that followed. The new social advance was so
vast and rapid and universally interesting that for a time it was
received with a world-wide, uncritical satisfaction. It was indeed
whispered here and there that the pursuit of counter-revolutionary
tendencies was becoming closer and keener. It was whispered that
the secret police was responsible for the disappearance of this or
that too outspoken antagonist of the new order of things and even
for one or two disappearances that had nothing to do with politics.
Freedom of publication was certainly declining, but there was very
little visible tightening-up of restriction. People were too
actively intent upon their individual shares in the new order of
things to note this diminution of dissentient expression, much less
to look for reasons for the decline. These were matters affecting
intellectuals, reactionary spirits and the religious, and they
scarcely qualified the plain reality that mankind as a whole was
living far more abundantly and happily than ever before.</p>

<p>Then came an event which sent a very perceptible quiver through
the quickening conscience of the reborn world community. This was
the sudden death of Bodisham at the age of fifty-two. He was taking
a summer holiday with his wife, a married son and daughter-in-law
and four grandchildren in the Aland Isles. He was taken ill in the
night after a boating picnic and, in spite of an immediate
concentration of medical skill from all parts of the world, he died
in six days. His seizure threw Rud into the greatest perturbation.
His first words when he heard the news were "They've poisoned him."
He leapt to that idea. He flew straight to his older colleague and
became a great nuisance to everyone in attendance upon the sick
man, demanding long interviews with the doctors and insisting upon
repeated visits to the sick-room.</p>

<p>Thirp, with one or two discreet-looking investigators, followed
hot upon his master's heels and immediately began checking up on
the procedure of the experts in attendance. The situation became
irritating for everybody and unfortunately certain disagreements
about diagnosis and treatment broke out among the physicians. They
quarrelled among themselves, and in their desire to discredit each
other upon minor points of procedure they did something to
discredit themselves in public opinion.</p>

<p>For the first time Rud admitted to himself and those about him
how much he had been dependent for his decisions upon Bodisham's
shrewd advice and how helpless he would feel without him. He wanted
to have stimulants administered so that he could "discuss matters
of primary importance that could not wait"; he insisted on talking
to the sinking man.</p>

<p>"He must be left in peace," said the doctors.</p>

<p>"But what shall I <i>do?</i>" he demanded. "He is my right hand.
Right hand, do I say? He is the half of my brain."</p>

<p>He commanded the doctors to save Bodisham at any cost; he was
imperative, he would hear of no alternative to recovery, and menace
began to mingle with his urgency. With a gathering dismay they
realised that they were going to be held responsible if the patient
did not recover. They decided that nothing should be neglected.
They disputed, therefore, about the minor details of his treatment,
and amidst their indecisions he died.</p>

<p>Their public trial followed, and it amazed the new world. The
hand of the World Director became only too perceptible in the
proceedings. The dominance of Thirp, he shone in organising the
evidence, and the remarkable way in which minor differences and
trivialities were woven into a charge of malignant conspiracy, ran
entirely contrary to the spirit of balance and candour which
Norvel's vast system of adult education was disseminating through
the new community colleges and the swelling literature of
information and discussion. The prosecution was reactionary in
temper, albeit it was undertaken by the Ministry for the Protection
of the Revolution, and the constitution and procedure of the Court
aimed at conviction from the outset. That secret distrust and
hatred of doctors common to all mankind had evidently existed in
Rud in an exaggerated form, and now flared out plainly and
conspicuously. These unfortunate men, gathered from the most varied
sources and having little in common but their scientific prestige,
were sentenced, four of them to death and the rest to indefinite
terms of imprisonment. And being so sentenced they vanished
abruptly from the public eye.</p>

<p>That sudden black, silent shutter was even more disconcerting
than the trial and the sentences.</p>

<p>Intelligent men and women all over the world found themselves
asking: "When were they killed?"</p>

<p>"How were they killed?"</p>

<p>"Were they shot?"</p>

<p>"And where?"</p>

<p>"And what has become of the others?" There was no answer to any
of these questions. The condemned men had disappeared. And with a
curious discomfort people began to realise that in this
exhilarating, renascent world of theirs there existed somewhere the
organisation, the machinery for an invisible, voiceless
incarceration and for the hidden execution of suspected men.</p>

<p>Bodisham's wife appeared transitorily in the background of the
case. "A very kindly woman," the official reporters had it then, "a
Jewess&mdash;the mother of five admirable children," Her
intervention availed nothing. She seemed to play an ambiguous part
in the drama because of her evident pity for the incriminated
doctors and her indignation at the methods of the court.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; II</h3>

<p class="first">The death of Bodisham marked a definite change of
phase in the history of the World Revolution. Up to the date of
that event it had seemed to be one whole process, complex in detail
but homogeneous in form. Now it began to be plain that the World
Revolution, like all its less universal precursors, like every
Revolution, was woven of two essentially distinct strands. There
was, for one strand, the innate insubordination of the human animal
which lies in wait for all decaying, hesitating or needlessly
oppressive systems of social control, an insubordination compounded
of fear, resentment and vindictiveness, and embodied in its final
dramatic phase by Rud and Thirp. And contrasting and interwoven
with that was the creative urge for order and achievement in the
human mind, an impulse more deliberate and sustained, finding its
expression in a progressive organisation of science, a progressive
extension of the scientific method to human affairs and the
systematic establishment of a new education, a new order and a new
regime of law. The two strands co-operated at first in their attack
upon their common objective, the old order of things. It was not at
first evident that while one aimed to destroy, the other sought to
replace. It was not necessary at first that it should become
evident. Together these two allied contraries produced the World
Revolution, which had not so much been evoked by the Group as found
its centre of expression therein.</p>

<p>Long after the formal defeat of the decadent old order was
manifest, long after the obsolete boundaries, the antiquated
Foreign Offices, the armies and navies, monetary manipulation, and
the unconscionable appropriations of private ownership in
collective businesses had been swept away, Rud's intense fear of
reaction and revenge enabled Bodisham to maintain his argument that
the only sane barrier against counter-revolution was the
establishment of a satisfactorily working new order in the place of
the old. To Rud the new institutions were essentially
fortifications against the old. He did not see them as collective
organisations imposing fresh codes of behaviour and necessitating
an education of their own. So, paradoxically enough, Rud, this
power-snatching, essential rebel, this instinctive lawless grabber,
this antisocial egotist, sustained the forces of constructive
control on earth through their early years of growth, while
Bodisham implemented and co-ordinated them and protected them from
any serious release of the destructive instinct in Rud.
Concurrently and, as it came to seem in the retrospect, naturally
and necessarily, there grew up an untrammelled and arbitrary
Caesarism in which political power became increasingly
concentrated, while beside it and interwoven with it, there arose a
world system of production, distribution, transport, education and
biological control, the living body of that planetary civilisation
which the new material conditions demanded. To many it seemed like
the complete confirmation of Hobbes' <i>Leviathan</i>, the ultimate
realisation of autocratic efficiency on a scale altogether more
gigantic than Hobbes could have foreseen. To others it seemed a
necessary phase that had to come to an end through the casting-off
of autocracy, as an eagle breaks out of its egg. The idea that
absolutism might be the necessary way to the world republic had
been floating in men's minds long before the last War to end War
and the rise of the Group to power. Young Dick Carstall had
foreshadowed it long ago when he talked with his father about his
own outlook on life.</p>

<p>The full quality of Bodisham's genius only became apparent after
his death. Released from his subtle interventions, the two
revolutionary strands began to part company forthwith. Then, as
young Carstall had foreseen, it began to dawn upon intelligent
observers throughout the world that the spirit of insubordination
and irresponsibility which leads through ascending phases of
lawlessness and violence to lawless personal rule is, by its very
nature, doomed to an ultimate grapple with a growing system of law,
order and economic justice and sanity. For years Bodisham had been
staving off that conflict. His untimely death left Rud, a little
heavier, less active and quick-witted, soaked now in preposterous
flattery and very much under the sway of Thirp, as the sole actual
controller and intermediary of a still very loosely knitted network
of world ministries. That young Heir of the Ages, the New World
State, suddenly found itself under the guardianship of quite a
different uncle. It was confronted with the problem of the
liberator become tyrant.</p>

<p>Norvel, who was probably, after Bodisham, the most powerful and
energetic intelligence in the Group, contemplated the new situation
with undisguised dismay. He was already in conflict with Quinlan
and Thirp upon the question of the extensive use of his educational
and publicity services for the propaganda of Rud-worship.
Bodisham's interposition had damped down the tension; but now he
would have to deal with these self-appointed slaves and masters of
Caesar directly, and come sooner or later into open conflict with
the Master himself. He hated and dreaded the issue to which he was
being drawn, the issue of the balanced and deliberate man face to
face with lop-sided energy. He reproached himself for his
acquiescence in the development of this cant of the Master
Director, beside which the cants of personal devotion to Hitler,
Mussolini, Stalin and God-save-the-King-whoever-he-is of his
boyhood seemed tolerable affectations. The ennobled portraits of
Rud now decorated every community centre from pole to pole, the
children of a new generation were being trained to a servile salute
of the supreme figure, they were being assured of his love and
wisdom, there were endless songs, hymns rather, sung in his honour.
Usually the schools began work in the morning with something very
like an opening prayer to Rud and the Revolution. The children took
to it with a disgusting readiness; the mediocre teachers liked it
sincerely, mainly because they found it so easy to impart.
Everywhere Caesar, the Czar, the Shah, the Mikado, the dear King
and Queen, the Leader, our Stalin, the Duce, Providence and God
Almighty had been or were being ousted from the facile childish
imagination of mankind, as the reassuring symbol that justified
submission to the restraints and routines of life, in favour of
this half-deified new-corner, this aggressive, querulous
individuality with indefinite powers of interference. Who did not
now seem to Norvel so harmlessly and satisfying mortal as once he
had done. The rapidity of this mental infection under modern
conditions astounded even Norvel, who was in as good a position as
anyone to have anticipated it. He had known how quickly now new
things could be spread about the world, but he had not realised how
rapidly old things could be dropped and forgotten.</p>

<p>Rud might live for another quarter century. By that time
Norvel's slowly growing educational machine might be shattered
again, and a universal, clumsy worship of Caesar, a habit of
acquiescence in the dogmatic state, be clamped upon mankind. That
imprisonment of the human mind might continue indefinitely, and
when at last it found a release, what sort of etiolated and
distorted thing might it not have become?</p>

<p>"They'd better go back to God," Norvel said to his wife. "Far
better go back to God for a bit&mdash;Providence the
Unready&mdash;whom anyhow one can trust to keep his fingers out of
things...</p>

<p>"Though I suppose we should soon get some Thirps in canonicals,
inventing a 'Will' for him and starting out to defend him against
the doubters...</p>

<p>"Some counter-balance there must be. There can be no right,
there can be no truth, there can be no healthy life&mdash;without
some dissent, without some opposition. A society without criticism
is like a hand without a thumb...</p>

<p>"Sooner or later this must come to a fight," he told her. "It
may be&mdash;uncomfortable for us."</p>

<p>"I'd hate to be comfortable," she said, "if it means your
standing anything we didn't think absolutely right. You go on and
I'll come with you."</p>

<p>"And if, in my disingenuous way, I falter&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"You'd better not," she said.</p>

<p>"Ugly things can happen in a prison&mdash;things worse than mere
clean shooting. A man's behaviour can be lied about. His wife may
be lied to."</p>

<p>"Giving in," she said, "is the worst sort of death. I'll stand
by you to the end. Maybe I'll stand by you if you <i>do</i> give
in, but then I shall feel like mad Queen Johanna who carried her
dead husband about with her in a coffin of lead...Trust me, my
dear. I'm sure of you. Don't I know you through and through?
Whatever they say, whatever you do, I shall believe in you."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; III</h3>

<p class="first">Rud's fundamental idea that he had in effect
become Everyman, had given him a far less tolerant attitude towards
anything that he regarded as a reactionary force in human affairs
than his primitive Radicalism would have enforced. His particular
grievance against Norvel was the increasing patience the latter was
displaying towards the old faiths, the old customs and usages, even
the old patriotisms that still stirred and protested beneath the
brave new surface of the world state. These idea systems were not
only alive and active in the minds and habits of the surviving
pre-revolutionary generations; they were still more vividly alive
in the bulk of literature, in the accumulations of art, in
customary metaphors and a thousand turns of language and social
attitudes. Through these media they infected the young far more
than through the immediate teaching of their elders. Rud, like the
early Christian fathers, like the Emperor Shi-Hwang-ti, like the
early Moslem who destroyed the library at Alexandria, like the
German Nazis, was a natural born book-keeper. Norvel, although he
was perhaps in his ultimate texture a far profounder modernist than
Rud, had a much more patient, comprehensive, tolerant and
respectful view of human tradition. He realised that inheritance is
possible without parricide.</p>

<p>Rud considered Norvel's methods vacillating and tinged with
insincerity. Several times he had urged Norvel to a more stringent
suppression of any literature or teaching that ignored or ran
counter to his new-world Caesarism, even if it did not specifically
attack it. Then, finding Norvel negligent of his protests, he began
to ignore him and to turn to Thirp and the Secret Police for the
Defence of the Revolution. There is more than one way of
restraining education. Norvel discovered that teachers, professors,
students and writers were being warned and arrested for
"counter-revolutionary activities". The lessons he incited them to
give in the schoolroom were being used as evidence against
them.</p>

<p>This exasperated him, but he found himself powerless to prevent
it. Fundamentally he had as little use for the organised religions
of the pre-revolutionary period as Rud, so far as their dogmas and
sacred symbols went, but his conception of their r&ocirc;le and destiny
was entirely different. He realised that whatever else these
organisations had imposed upon mankind, however much they had
hampered enlightenment, they had also provided a shelter for a vast
amount of devotion, a conception of self-control, valuable moral
suggestions and a justification for much gentle living. It seemed
to him just as silly to believe in nothing as to believe in Mumbo
Jumbo. It was possible, he thought, for hard-minded men of mature
years to frame their lives in social co-operation, but his vast
enterprise of training the whole world for one community of life
and behaviour was bringing him to a conviction that for the young
and the vulgar at least, the idea of an interested heavenly father
was a practical necessity. He did not like the little child
atheists who were brought up before Thirp's investigators to
witness to the secret vice of prayer or hymn-singing in their
parents.</p>

<p>Rud's instinctive hatred of religion was becoming more and more
marked. He had learnt at his mother's knee to resent the existence
of another being more important than himself. At first he assailed
only the endowments of the churches, and that only as a part of the
general socialisation of rents and monopolist profits. But his
confiscatory methods included religious buildings and monuments of
all sorts. It has to be recognised that the traditional religious
bodies stood up very ineffectively to his persecution, if one can
call it a persecution. It is the heretics and innovators of all
sorts who have been persecuted in the past, and the authorised
religious organisations that have persecuted. When in their turn
they have suffered effective persecution, their collapse has been
prompt. Rud saw to it that their finances were austerely treated
and the ensuing decadence was swift and irreparable.</p>

<p>But out of the crushed ruins of the churches there came
presently oozing a mental juice, a seeping and penetrating
recrudescence of religiosity. This was going on not merely in the
former Christian countries. It was easy to rout Allah out of a
mosque, but Allah hidden somewhere in a human heart was an
altogether different problem in eradication.</p>

<p>Rud was particularly exercised by the New Catholic movement,
which broke out a year or so after he had had the satisfaction of
converting the entire Vatican quarter into a public monument under
the control of the Roman Archaeological Department. Christianity
was now as homeless again as its founder. These New Christians
claimed to be the original Catholic Church, they were mainly
Catholics, but they had associated with themselves very
considerable bodies of adherents from the other shattered Christian
Churches. The reunion of the Churches, so long dreamt of by Liberal
priests of every denomination, had been greatly facilitated by the
disappearance of highly salaried posts for the heads of the various
communions. A general loyalty to the Pope, who was now in hiding,
was asserted by these Neo-Christians, the mass was celebrated, at
first publicly and then&mdash;when that was prohibited because of
nationalist demonstrations that followed its celebrations in
various old Catholic countries&mdash;in secret. Rud's rough hand
was provoking reprisals.</p>

<p>The Pope hesitated for some time about the form Christian
resistance should take, but a number of more or less representative
religious leaders already spoke out boldly against the World
Director as Anti-Christ. The Pope in various messages to the
faithful distinguished meticulously between the autocracy of Rud
and secular education on the one hand, and the new financial,
economic and political unification of the world on the other. The
former he condemned unreservedly, the latter he commended. In one
respect the Holy Father was inconsistent. Although on the one hand
he denounced usury, on the other he complained bitterly of the
confiscation of the ecclesiastical investments.</p>

<p>In imitation of the early Christians who refused to burn incense
before the effigy of Caesar, these Neo-Christians were refusing
stoutly to stand up and salute at the mention of Rud. This idea
spread to Islam, and huge crowds would shout defiantly whenever the
saltire was displayed. Rud came raging to Norvel with the discovery
that a considerable proportion of the teachers in the elementary
schools were Neo-Christians, Jews, Moslems, Hindus and the like,
some secretly so, some outspokenly.</p>

<p>"But I <i>must</i> staff my schools with these people," said
Norvel. "If there are to be schools, if there are to be any
teachers at all. There is no one else available. Before we can
completely modernise the school centres we must have twenty million
highly educated teachers&mdash;twenty million&mdash;and how are we
to get them until we have built up something better than these poor
little old scattered universities of ours? It's a marvel people
know as much as they do. It's a marvel they are not ten times more
ignorant and credulous than they are. I'm driving on with it. But,
as you know, the birth-rate is going up again. I'm building my
intellectual dams and sluice gates against a fast rising flood of
babies..."</p>

<p>"You go on printing the Bible," said Rud. "It's time that
rag-bag, that collection of fever rags, was suppressed."</p>

<p>"You do not need to suppress it. So far as it is historically
misleading, and so far as it sustains that horrible doctrine of a
Chosen People, it is already lapsing into complete incredibility.
It's a curious book and some of the stories about those artful old
patriarchs are told with a bald simplicity that is very effective.
I don't mind its being superseded but I object to its suppression.
I mean to print every book that people ask for, until the paper
supply gives out. There it shall be for them to read if they want
to read it, and for them to ask other people to read too, if they
value it as much as that. There it is, evidence for or against
them."</p>

<p>"And so it all goes on!"</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure that for human beings under twenty-five to
thirty the idea of the Fatherhood of God isn't a very good idea.
Suppose it is artificial. Aren't clothes artificial? You have to
wrap up a child's body in chilly weather. Why not its mind?"</p>

<p>Rud was not listening. He was prowling about the room.</p>

<p>"They've still got a Pope dodging about somewhere," he said
suddenly, coming to a stop. "They conspire to hide him. It's
becoming a sort of sport to frustrate me. But I'll get him. I will
not let life remain worth while for anyone who sets up to be Pope
against me..."</p>

<p>Norvel laughed abruptly. "To think of it! A Pope-hunt! Just as
<i>they</i> used to hunt the Albigenses. It's funny. These
Pope-hunters of yours ought to wear the old Nazi swastikas; your
white cross is improper. You can't have Crusaders hunting a Pope.
No...But you're all wrong about this. You're going to enlist on the
side of the old religions just the very force that made you a
fanatical atheist!"</p>

<p>"<i>What!</i>" shouted Rud.</p>

<p>"Resentment at authority. You will make men believers and
martyrs who never gave a thought to God as a ruler, before your
pressure began. As an alternative, purely as an alternative to
you&mdash;they will fall back upon him..."</p>

<p>"I never thought of this," said Rud.</p>

<p>"It's elementary social psychology. Gods have been man's refuge
from human power since the very beginning of history."</p>

<p>"I never thought of that. I never saw it like that," said Rud,
and looked at Norvel as though he had seen him suddenly in a new
light. "That accounts for a lot of things. Gods the alternatives to
rulers&mdash;Gods become Leader of the Opposition...</p>

<p>"But why should people dislike the new order as I give it them?"
asked Rud. "Why cannot they be rational? Am I anything but the
embodiment of the Common Interest and the Common Will? What have
they to complain of? Think of what the world was like fifteen years
ago?...See what I have done for them!...I suppose it is the older
people...It isn't the common people; it can't be. It's something
organised. Some subtle undermining. Where is the leakage? Why do
these ideas survive? Are you <i>sure</i>, Norvel, these schools of
yours&mdash;?"</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; IV</h3>

<p class="first">Thirp put it into Rud's head that Norvel, instead
of using the cinema in the schools to display the rapid development
of the new life of mankind, the public festivals, the sunlit crops,
the triumphs of engineering that were in progress, all with a
montage in which the Beethovenised head of Rud, the ruler and
guide, was displayed in such a manner as to evoke and sustain a
world-wide enthusiasm, was diverting the young with old romantic
and trivial stories and propagating a cult of disintegrating
laughter, even resorting to the pre-revolutionary period for his
material.</p>

<p>Accordingly Rud asked Norvel to show him a selection of the
still popular classics. Norvel, who knew nothing of what Rud had in
his mind, was pleased by this sudden interest in his work. "I've
been reviving a lot of old stuff that I remember as a boy," he
said. "Perhaps you would like to see that. Some of it is quite good
enough to delight the children still. The comic stuff for example.
The taste for romance and herosim seems to have changed. That sort
of thing is too remote from our world to-day even to seem funny.
Our children nowadays can make nothing of Cinderella or the Fairy
Prince. But when it comes to sheer absurdity, it's a different
story. Certain sorts of fun seem to be universal and perennial.
Look at this, for example."</p>

<p>He motioned to the operator to run first one and then another of
those old-fashioned quaintnesses, very early films, old cartoons,
<i>Felix the Cat</i> and so forth. "We use this sort of thing to
illustrate the history of the films."</p>

<p>At first Rud was amused. He forgot Thirp's suggestions for a
while. Then suspicion crept back into his mind.</p>

<p>"That," said Norvel, "is Charlie Chaplin. He has a curious human
absurdity no one has ever excelled. All these films of him were
suppressed in Germany during the Hitler regime. You notice the
moustache?..."</p>

<p>"I did not realise they have a political significance," said
Rud, and became more intent.</p>

<p>Norvel came to the post-war period and traced the development of
Walt Disney's art. Gradually as the plain Micky Mouse gave way to
his coloured version and Donald Duck appeared, silence came upon
Rud. And then to the infinite astonishment of Norvel, he broke out
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Who <i>is</i> this Walt Disney? He seems to me to be a
<i>very</i> dangerous revolutionary. This&mdash;all of
this&mdash;is underhand sedition. I'm not such a fool&mdash;. I see
his point. This Donald Duck! It's subtle but I get him. I
<i>get</i> him. The busybody who interferes and tangles up
everything. That's the suggestion. That's how I'm lied about.
That's what they want to say of me&mdash;if they dared. He's even
got the sailor's cap I wear at times. The way the forehead is
shaped! Exactly the same! The grave look he gives people before he
does something decisive. It is insidious. It is abominable. It is
deliberate. This Disney ought to be shot. Where does he work? Where
is he to be found?"</p>

<p>"These films were made before the Group existed," said Norvel,
recovering slowly from his amazement. "I don't know where Disney
is. Probably he is quite old by now. He was doing his work before
the Last War. I don't know if he is still alive. Maybe he is still
making films, happily unconscious..."</p>

<p>Autocracy was making Norvel a facile liar. He had as a matter of
fact been talking to Disney three days before, and discussing a
scheme for a great series of operas with him. But he saw no reason
why Rud should intervene in these matters.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it!" said Rud, suddenly pathetic. "If these
films were made long ago, why didn't I see them? They're new. Or
they've been altered...It's so cruel, Norvel, so unjust to me...Why
do you show them? Anyhow, why do you show them? Don't you realise
the drift of them? Or do you?"</p>

<p>He paused interrogative, his head a little on one side, his skew
mouth like a beak slightly open. In the back of Norvel's mind was a
realisation that this incarnation of the Common Energy of Mankind
was after all just a wee bit like Donald Duck.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; V</h3>

<p class="first">One day Chiffan said something very disturbing to
his Phoebe. He had been unusually moody, silent and distraught for
some time, and excessively gentle with her, never saying an absurd
thing. Then late one afternoon, as they sat together in their
loggia that looked out upon the tennis courts where they had been
entertaining half a dozen friends, he broached his trouble.</p>

<p>"This can't go on," he said.</p>

<p>"We're happy!" she answered, astonished.</p>

<p>"Rud," he said.</p>

<p>"You are still troubled about him!"</p>

<p>"I am troubled about the whole world. On his account. We have
made a sort of God of him..."</p>

<p>"Isn't that enough?" she asked as he paused.</p>

<p>"It's too much. To all intents and purposes, Phoebe, he is mad.
Characteristics in him that used to be amusing are becoming
monstrous and evil. He discovers danger everywhere. This infernal
secret police of his is arresting people, making them vanish,
killing them...Because he is afraid..."</p>

<p>"But what can you do?" asked Phoebe.</p>

<p>"I ought to do something. I don't know what, but I ought to do
something. In a way I am responsible for him. I was his
impressario. In those old days I launched him on the world."</p>

<p>"But nowadays you hardly ever see him. He avoids you."</p>

<p>"I ought to see him. I ought to know more about him. Now I get
all these queer things about him at second hand. I don't know what
is happening to him. I don't know whether he is going mad or simply
getting loose. Sometimes I think he's just an imaginative egotist,
who has escaped from all restraint. Maybe he is what many men might
prove to be with the escapement off. I&mdash;in a sort of
way&mdash;was his escapement...I ought to have stuck closer to
him...</p>

<p>"He used to listen to me. If I went to him now and spoke
plainly...He might be sulky but he would take it in.</p>

<p>"Maybe I am the only person alive able to recall him to his
former self."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VI</h3>

<p class="first">Chiffan found it more difficult even than he had
expected to get an audience with Rud. He had to apply, he had to
wait, he was kept waiting in an ante-chamber for three-quarters of
an hour. When at last he was admitted to the Presence, he found
himself in a long room with a polished floor that slanted upward to
the dais that carried Rud's desk. Half-way there was a flight of
seven shallow steps, too wide to be taken two at a time and only
about five inches high. They would have reduced the most confident
stride to a totter. He thought how much Rud had improved upon the
crude methods of Bohun's reception room, and the reminiscence
served to sharpen the blade of hard derision in his make-up,
already whetted by his unnecessary wait outside. He was no longer
the affectionate and persuasive Chiffan he might have been.</p>

<p>Rud sat at the desk pretending to be occupied by some papers and
peering under his shaded desk lamp at the approach of his old
friend. Chiffan, entering, and seeing this pose of preoccupation,
advanced at a leisurely stroll, hands in pockets, and realising the
difficulty of the shallow steps, halted there, turned his profile
to the Dictator and professed to consult some memoranda, humming
and&mdash;as Rud seemed still occupied&mdash;producing a pocket
pencil and making corrections. Rud decided to conclude his sham
work with a sigh and turned his face towards his visitor.</p>

<p>Chiffan packed up his memoranda, clicked his pencil together,
pocketed it and strolled up to the desk. "Hope I don't interrupt
your&mdash;annotations," he said.</p>

<p>Rud stood up, came to the corner of his bureau, and stared at
Chiffan in silence.</p>

<p>Chiffan's first impression was that the lop-sided scowl had
become intenser and then that Rud looked overstrained and ill. His
face was a deader white than ever and his eyes burnt with an
unwonted fever. It was going to be harder to bring this Rudlike
creature back to the Rud of the summer school and Camborne Square
than Chiffan had anticipated. But there was no time now to alter
what he had in his mind to say.</p>

<p>"Hello, Rud," he said. "How goes it with the Representative
Common Man?"</p>

<p>"You wanted to talk to me?" said Rud.</p>

<p>"As one common man to another."</p>

<p>The malignity of the scowl increased. "About what?"</p>

<p>"About that idea of your being the supreme embodiment of the
common man and the effect that it is having upon the world."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>what</i> effect?" asked Rud.</p>

<p>Chiffan had meant his talk to develop gradually, but this
compact answer spoilt his approach. He felt himself blundering
directly into the gist of what he had to say. "There is a feeling
abroad," he said, "that your r&ocirc;le of being a sort of incarnation of
humanity is being&mdash;to put it bluntly, Rud overplayed. It was,
you know, one of the greatest of your inspirations to make our
Revolution the Revolution of the Common Man, not to set up yourself
or the Gang or anybody as the Heaven-sent leader of mankind. It was
a great phrase to call you the World Trustee and make you, so to
speak, the Commonest of the Common, in the common interest...You
<i>were</i> the common man, yes. <i>The</i> common man. On those
terms we won the World Revolution. But now the job's done and
finished, and I take it you have to be a common man again. Because
if you don't, you will come to be in a sort of way a new Caesar, a
new Imperator, Boss of the World, a tyrant, traitor to the
Revolution."</p>

<p>"Well," said Rud. "That is plain enough, anyhow."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to begin as bluntly as this with what I have to
say."</p>

<p>"But you meant to say it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"A sort of Message, eh?" said Rud. "Telling me my times are at
an end and that I have to go. Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin. Eh?"</p>

<p>"Don't make me feel like a Prophet of the Lord rebuking a wicked
King of Israel," said Chiffan.</p>

<p>"And what in the name of the Lord," said Rud, "is this message
you bring me if it is not that?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Chiffan, "if that is the tone we are to adopt, then
let us speak plainly; the time <i>has</i> come for you yourself, as
the last crowning service you can render to mankind, to prepare for
the liquidation of your trust."</p>

<p>"The liquidation of my trust?"</p>

<p>"The restoration of the world to the heir."</p>

<p>"Who is?"</p>

<p>"The common man&mdash;the common-sense of mankind."</p>

<p>"Go on," said Rud darkly. "Go on. Tell me more of what you have
in mind."</p>

<p>"I came to tell you&mdash;plainly&mdash;as no one else will dare
to do&mdash;that you are hanging on to power too long. You know how
to overthrow, Rud, you know how to destroy and how to grasp, but
you don't know how to guide and you don't know how to let go."</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;on behalf of yourself and friends&mdash;I suppose
you have come to tell me to let go."</p>

<p>"I came of my own accord."</p>

<p>Rud tried to look penetrating, but he merely looked cunningly
sceptical. "Assuming that is true," he said, "go on. I am to let
go. Well? I want to hear all you have to say against me."</p>

<p>It appeared to Chiffan that Rud had become endowed with a new
defensive obduracy.</p>

<p>"It's not against you," he said.</p>

<p>"Go on," said the Dictator. "Now you are here."</p>

<p>"Well, Rud, in the old days you used to face up to facts. I ask
you not to think of me as an antagonist. Why should you? You never
did that in the old days. Hear me out. You have played a great part
in this change-over of the world. You have been the star in the
limelight, but&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but? Go on. Go on."</p>

<p>"You are not the whole play. Damn it, Rud, you <i>must</i> face
up to that? This new world didn't begin, and it won't end, with
you. You have wiped out finance, which had grown like a cancer in
the interstices of business, and you have wiped out every sort of
sovereignty, public or private. There is no sovereign state and no
sovereign owner any more. You exorcised them both. And the world
now is full of able people setting about the complex&mdash;the very
complex&mdash;readjustment of social life to its new physical
conditions."</p>

<p>"You are telling me this? You are coming into my remote,
secluded life to tell me this?"</p>

<p>"This new world isn't your making, Rud. That is what I am
telling you. All you have done is to release it. It was struggling
into existence before we were born. It was dawning on men's
imaginations already in the eighteenth century&mdash;if not
before."</p>

<p>"You make me feel as though I was in the history schools again,"
said Rud.</p>

<p>"But look at the facts!"</p>

<p>"And to whom am I to give way? Tell me that. Who is to make the
new directorate? You and these friends you speak for?"</p>

<p>"Rud, again I tell you, I have no friends behind me in this.
There is no conspiracy or movement or revolt against you. None at
all. But I want to warn you. It will come, Rud. Unless you relax
this grip you have taken upon the world movement. Men will not
stand it. Rud, I implore you, listen to me. I have always done my
best to stand at your elbow, warn you and supplement you."</p>

<p>Rud was nodding his head in silence. He regarded Chiffan with a
faint, derisive grin, and there was hatred in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Who is to make the new directorate? When you have got rid of
me?"</p>

<p>"There is no need of a directorate. We did need a destroyer, we
did need some one to break up the old system, and that is done.
There are no States now; there are Services. There is a new sort of
man taking charge of things. The mentality of men of science, of
technicians, of responsible critics and functionaries, is spreading
through the whole race. The old struggle for power is over."</p>

<p>"Men of science!" said Rud with bitter scorn. "Technicians! I
can make 'em and break 'em."</p>

<p>"You can break them," said Chiffan.</p>

<p>"But not make them?"</p>

<p>"No. And you can't do without them."</p>

<p>"You are just a theorist, a constitution-monger, an
ideologist."</p>

<p>"Gollys! Why! Who <i>was</i> it? Why!&mdash;<i>Reedly</i> used
to abuse ideologists. You're not going the way of Reedly, Rud?"</p>

<p>A spasm of anger betrayed itself in Rud. He controlled
himself.</p>

<p>"So I am to give way. I am to retire. I suppose I had better go
off fishing, eh? And some sort of Royal Society and World Civil
Service and new Universities and so on, what your friend
Norvel&mdash;oh yes, he's your friend, I know&mdash;calls the
Knowledge Organisation, My God! are going to take over the world
that I&mdash;yes, <i>I</i>&mdash;have liberated and unified. Am I
permitted to be sceptical? I tell you, Chiffan, I have had time for
thought and experience since you and I talked nonsense together in
those old days. And there is nothing whatever to override Will in
human affairs. And like it or not&mdash;and <i>you</i>,&mdash;you
know hardly anything of the burthen I carry&mdash;I am the
Will."</p>

<p>Chiffan swung half round with a gesture of despair, took a step
away from Rud and then turned upon him.</p>

<p>"Rud," he cried. "Don't be an idiot! What has come over you?
Will is all about us, the collective will, guided by the free
wisdom of thousands of brains. Will can never be concentrated in
one individual. Power you can grab but Will escapes you. You of all
people understood that so well&mdash;once. Parallel co-operation!
Your own phrase, man! And now, here you are, lonely, secretly
wretched, implacable, trying to clutch everything. <i>Why?</i> Can
you trust nothing free outside yourself? Come off it, Rud. Come off
it."</p>

<p>He stopped short and began again on a less strident note.</p>

<p>"Why should I lecture you like this? Remember yourself, man.
Remember your humanity. Remember how shabby we were when we met.
Remember our long tramp together and how hungry we used to get in
the afternoon. Remember that punt&mdash;the rabbit and
onions&mdash;that visit to Jim Flab's headquarters at
Balting&mdash;that stinking little major! What has happened to you
to forget such things?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember all that. Yes."</p>

<p>Rud's pallor seemed to increase. He had something very urgent to
say and he did not know how to begin. It looked almost as though he
was going to be sick. He brought his face closer to Chiffan's. When
at last he spoke, he spoke in a close undertone and a new
bitterness had come into his voice.</p>

<p>"And I remember your bragging about that Lancashire girl's neck.
I remember that too. You talked about having her and how easy she
would have been. In the punt you talked. I remember every word of
it. I remember you fleering and jeering at me about my having to
give up all thought of sex. Afterwards on the road. After Balting.
All through our lives you have relieved yourself about that.
Always. <i>Do</i> I remember? Is there a thing I forget? Your
ill-concealed envy of my&mdash;my genius, and your attempts to
compensate your inferiority by all those petty triumphs over
women&mdash;and me. Envy, incarnate envy: that is you, Chiffan.
You, the cheerful friend with a sneer! And still you are
unsatisfied. Now you would like to see all that I have done,
undone. You want to see me and my Revolution&mdash;yes, my
Revolution&mdash;prostrate and shattered. You would welcome back a
thousand things I have dismissed, just to spite me, just for the
satisfaction of seeing my name and my pictures taken out of the
schools, just to stifle the love the people bear me all over the
world. That's what you can't endure, Chiffan. That's why you come
here spitting malice and venom at me. Taking the risk. What a long
story it makes from first to last! Flaunting your mistresses under
my nose! Always you have done that. Winding up with that painted
wife of yours! <i>You</i> are virile, aren't you? <i>You!</i> I've
had to be continent while you've had the fun. Chiffan the
free-and-easy; Chiffan who says what he likes and does what he
likes; Chiffan the gay smiler; Chiffan the debonair! The playboy of
the revolution! While old friend Rud is the Power Grub. Poor old
Rud. Shrunken old Rud. But now&mdash;and now&mdash;we come to a
reckoning. <i>Now</i> the Power Grub <i>has</i> you."</p>

<p>Chiffan stood stunned in front of this fantastic outbreak of
long-hidden resentment.</p>

<p>"Well," said Rud, "you chose to come to me and ask for it. It
was only an anticipation&mdash;It wouldn't have been long before
Thirp came for you. I know about you. You have been watched. You
have been overheard."</p>

<p>He stopped short, resolute but unable to say clearly the purpose
in his mind. The two old associates stared at one another.</p>

<p>"So it's like <i>that</i>," said Chiffan at last.</p>

<p>"How else can it be?"</p>

<p>Chiffan shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I have known&mdash;I have felt it coming. And yet&mdash;it's
incredible."</p>

<p>"Inevitable. Incredible to you perhaps. While you have been
dreaming, Chiffan, about this dear, dear old friendship of ours and
how you could always win me over whenever you wanted to do so, I
have kept wide awake. Wide awake. You come here to tell me all
sorts of things, but now you have been told something, fair and
square. Is there any need to say more?"</p>

<p>Chiffan stood still and silent for a long second or so. But Rud
had finished. The audience was at an end. Then slowly and
meditatively Chiffan spoke.</p>

<p>"I'm not sorry, Rud, for what I've done for you in the past.
Whatever I <i>have</i> done for you. We've had a great time
together with this little world."</p>

<p>"<i>We!</i>" said Rud.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;we. I taught you many things. At the
start...And&mdash;like all pilots who're dropped, I don't like to
think of you without me. Silly, isn't it?..."</p>

<p>Rud made no answer. He stood sullenly mulish. "Good-bye," said
Chiffan.</p>

<p>And then: "Good-bye, Rud."</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>He walked down the long slant slowly, resisting its urgency to
quicken his steps&mdash;never once looking back.</p>

<p>Rud remained silent and motionless until the door had closed on
Chiffan.</p>

<p>"He jeered at me," he whispered. "Always he jeered at me.
Always. Him and his <i>Bitches!</i>...All those women...He was
jeering at me right to the last. The pilot. <i>Him!</i> The
<i>pilot!</i>"</p>

<p>He went to the great desk. There for a little space he was
immobile. At last he pressed the telephone button and gave Thirp
formal orders for Chiffan's arrest.</p>

<p>"Tell Rothberg to deal with him," he said.</p>

<p>"Do you <i>mean</i> this?" asked Thirp, and for once he sounded
over-awed.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rud, "I mean it."</p>

<p>He held his telephone and there came no sound of replacement
from the other end.</p>

<p>Perhaps Thirp would say something that would alter the
situation. Nothing came. He must have put down his instrument
noiselessly.</p>

<p>Something caught at Rud's throat. His indignation evaporated. He
felt that Chiffan had dealt very badly with him and forced this
tragic situation upon him. He had <i>made</i> Chiffan. Yes, Chiffan
was his making. He had discovered him a tramp on the roadside. He
had liked his freakish humour. And&mdash;it was true&mdash;they had
had good times together. They had been young together, and that in
itself is to have a good time. Before the terrible responsibilities
of power forced them apart. There had been a sort of friendship.
Even if it was a mistaken friendship...</p>

<p>He stood telephone in hand. He raised it to recall Thirp, but
Thirp was still waiting there in silence.</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Thirp at once, receptive and colourless. Rud
hesitated.</p>

<p>"Let everything be done&mdash;with the utmost consideration," he
said, and then slowly replaced the instrument.</p>

<p>He addressed the empty room. "<i>No</i>," he said. "No man shall
undermine me. My Empire before all other conditions. Even my
dearest friend..."</p>

<p>A wave of self-pity submerged him. In his emotion he relapsed
into temporary Deism.</p>

<p>"My God up there&mdash;you! I am as lonely as you are. Yes. As
lonely as you, the everlasting God. Was there ever anyone
human&mdash;as alone as I? Deserted by my last friend! And
now&mdash;nobody knows it, but I am getting ill...I feel ill...</p>

<p>"I must have strength. I must keep fit. My task is not yet
done."</p>

<p>Then as if some contrary consideration was attempting to assert
itself: "My task is not yet done. While I live I must guard this
new life I have given mankind. It is <i>my</i> Revolution.
<i>My</i> duty..."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VII</h3>

<p class="first">One moonlit summer night a few weeks later Thirp
was murdered by a young man to whom for some reason he had held out
dazzling prospects of promotion and then disappointed. The
particulars of his death are no part of this history, only its
suddenness and its effect upon Rud concern us here.</p>

<p>Once more for a brief final phase of lucidity he realised his
own personal inefficiency. Once more he felt matters beyond his
management were being forced into his hands. It was a greater loss
even than Bodisham, because while Bodisham left him diagrams and
projects, plain, open and completely understandable, Thirp had been
deliberately secretive. He had always kept his methods to himself.
Rud did not know very much even about his agent's immediate
underlings, and now for a time at least, until he could gain a
controlling knowledge of them, he must be his own watch-dog.
Rothberg came to him at once obviously intent to play the same
confidential r&ocirc;le that Thirp had filled so satisfactorily. But Rud
did not like Rothberg. The evil in his nature had none of the
redeeming dilettantism of Thirp; he made Rud feel unsafe with him;
he was of the hard, dark police type who hated his quarry, took
every advantage in the hunt and exulted self-righteously in a kill.
Now Thirp had always behaved as though a political murder was a
sadly regrettable necessity. For him it was a curious aspect of
this strange, unaccountable game of life. He made Rud feel that
though he could inflict death, he would never inflict wanton
humiliation. He would do everything as it were under
protest&mdash;though quite effectively. But Rothberg flushed with
zealous animosity when he heard the mere name of a marked man.</p>

<p>Rothberg's impulse for self-assertion through destruction was
far cruder in its expression than Thirp's, cruder even than Rud's.
He was not merely a killer; he liked to stamp them down.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; VIII</h3>

<p class="first">Norvel's theory that the Dictator was a necessary
evil and that the forces of progressive adaptation could live
through and live down any Dictatorship, was losing its validity
with every fresh aggression of Rud's. And Norvel was losing his
temper. As one intrusion of the political police into his new
universities and school organisations followed another, as he found
even his best school teachers were being terrorised, his clearest
thinkers silenced and his carefully planned instruction in biology,
history and social science more or less systematically and
ignorantly confused, revised or suppressed, he began, reluctantly
enough at first and then without reluctance, to scheme for the
restraint and elimination of Rud.</p>

<p>He was not a good conspirator. He had begun as a publisher and
propagandist and he had grown into an educator; these are outspoken
activities, and he did not know how to set about any secret
plotting. He sounded several of his colleagues. Neither Bellacourt
nor Holbank nor Roots seemed to be greatly stirred by the
suppression of thought and discussion. They were entirely
preoccupied by their own immense jobs, they were interfered with
very little, as yet. It seemed a matter of secondary importance to
them who was fed, clothed, carried about by their always more
competent material organisations. They disliked the idea of any
disturbance of this vast rationalisation of the general world
economy. They wanted things to go on as they were going. But
Heming, who was in control of the world's health, and Lacoste, who
was a sort of Minister for a miscellany of biological services,
wilderness conservation, deep sea conservation, genetic
reorganisation, a service leading possibly to human eugenics,
population regulation and the like, were in closer contact with the
mental organisation of the world. Their work overlapped Norvel's at
a number of contacts, and their general outlook was very similar to
his. They disliked the systematic falsification of human relations
by this new sort of absolute monarchy quite as much as Norvel.</p>

<p>So that when they found themselves in conference upon a project
of Lacoste's for eliminating various infections, disease carriers
and insect pests once and for all from human experience, it was
natural and easy to fall into a discussion of the ever-intensifying
World Dictatorship.</p>

<p>They had dismissed the assistants, secretaries and
stenographers; they sat together at the end of the long table in
the main conference chamber of the Education Office and their
voices dropped to undertones. Now and then one or other of them
would glance over his shoulder to be sure that they were still
alone.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Lacoste, watching the departure of the last
secretary.</p>

<p>"We did not mention all sorts of things," said Heming; "for
various good reasons. We seem to go about our business in blinkers.
I have been feeling all along that the gist of our discussion was
unspoken."</p>

<p>Norvel sat with his arms folded on the table. "Can things go on
much longer?" he asked, "as they are going?"</p>

<p>"Things are so secret," said Lacoste. "I only <i>heard</i> about
Chiffan six days ago. I can get no particulars."</p>

<p>"Chiffan?" asked Heming. "What is this about Chiffan?"</p>

<p>"Shot," said Norvel.</p>

<p>Heming shut his mouth tight, saying not a word. His astonishment
was more eloquent than any outcry.</p>

<p>Norvel looked at him. "Something has to be done," said
Norvel.</p>

<p>"And what do you think has to be done?" said Lacoste.</p>

<p>"That is the riddle," said Heming.</p>

<p>"This new world of ours is merely a scaffolding&mdash;so far,"
said Norvel. "A struggle for the leadership might bring it all
down. Can we bear to see this World Revolution lose its headway, as
the Russian Revolution did when Stalin and Trotsky fell out? I
would rather be boiled in oil than destroy the work that has been
done already, that he as leader has done&mdash;the ending of war,
peace throughout the world."</p>

<p>"But he himself is beginning to destroy it," said Heming.</p>

<p>"They are increasing the secret police," said Lacoste. "They
have been interfering lately with the collection of our vital
statistics. They want to inspect the confidential answers to our
questionnaires in one or two places where they are after people.
People who have been denounced."</p>

<p>"That infernal little weasel Rothberg wants to found a special
college for detectives," said Norvel, "a spy and sneak
factory."</p>

<p>"What will you do about those confidential answers?" asked
Heming of Lacoste.</p>

<p>"Hold them as long as possible and then burn them if we're
pressed."</p>

<p>"But then <i>your</i> people will get arrested."</p>

<p>Lacoste shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"There is no prospect of an insurrection&mdash;anywhere?"
speculated Heming.</p>

<p>"Do we want an insurrection?" said Norvel. "I don't think so.
Partial insurrections are quite possible. They are probable.
There's plenty of inflammatory stuff in Islam for example. But that
sort of thing means disorder, disintegration. And as a matter of
fact, and it's more a matter of fact every year, the young, the
masses of young people, white, black, brown or yellow everywhere,
believe in Rud, swear by him. They identify him completely with the
new world...We must let them down gently. No one of us ever foresaw
the tremendous power of modern mind-moulding. The old Nazi and
Soviet methods have been developed now to a tremendous efficiency.
From the infants' school on. The young don't understand how it is
with us. They would not understand any move to limit or restrain
him. The mischief's done. I do not see how we can disentangle
ourselves from this&mdash;this Tyranny without a social
disaster."</p>

<p>"How long may he live?" asked Lacoste. "He looks pretty ill at
times. He keeps changing his doctors."</p>

<p>"He's a nervous wreck," said Heming. "But still he may live for
years. It's mental strain with him far more than bodily. Quite
possibly he'll go mad."</p>

<p>"That won't help us," said Norvel grimly.</p>

<p>"If he went quite obviously mad," said Lacoste. "So plainly mad
that we could hustle him into a mental hospital&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Norvel turned to Heming with a new idea. "Even if he
<i>wasn't</i> mad," he said, and left the suggestion at that.</p>

<p>"He chooses his own attendants. It would be impossible," said
Heming, thinking it over.</p>

<p>"Some accident," said Lacoste.</p>

<p>"You mean, in one word, assassination?" said Norvel.</p>

<p>"Open assassination&mdash;unless it was done by an actual
certifiable lunatic&mdash;on some personal score...No." Lacoste
shook his head. "It would be a tremendous social shock. Rothberg
might jump the situation. No, I mean an accident&mdash;an
aeroplane, a car."</p>

<p>"I don't care a rap for Rud. I never did care for him," said
Norvel. "And since this Chiffan affair I hate him. Simply and
plainly I hate him. I think the original Group laid the foundation
of all this trouble by letting him acquire this preposterous
personal power. There was no need for it. He grabbed under their
noses,&mdash;and with their consent. None of us three were in the
original Group, and we know nothing of the magic of early
associations. No. He has to go. I don't care how he goes, so far as
he and I are concerned. Nevertheless I will consider no way of
disposing of him that would subject this New World Order to stress
and danger. That's the difficulty. That's the real problem."</p>

<p>"But how can men of our sort conspire?" said Lacoste. "It has
been trained out of us. Which of us three would be the most
incapable, if it came to dealing with the First Murderer, the
Second Murderer, and so on? Which of us could deal with a Rothberg?
We are not that sort of stuff. We could as soon go down on all
fours to fight dogs. We are different animals."</p>

<p>"And so there is nothing to be done?" said Heming.</p>

<p>"Chiffan dies and nothing can be done," said Lacoste.</p>

<p>"My schools are shattered," said Norvel. "My universities are
debased and nothing can be done...I won't stand that. And
yet&mdash;how the devil&mdash;?"</p>

<p>He was pallid with impotent hatred. And with his hatred went a
strong infusion of self-contempt.</p>

<p>"Oh! it is intolerable," he cried, "that the lives of hundreds
of millions of people should be dishonoured beneath the vanity and
folly of one single man. It is intolerable that Chiffan should be
murdered and we do nothing. I more than anyone, am to blame. The
worst sort of treason is the treason of the teacher. And I gave him
the crowd. I. I let his propaganda go. I helped it. I, as much as
anyone, am responsible for this servitude. Prospero slave to
Caliban! Horrible!"</p>

<p>"But what can we <i>do?</i>" asked Heming. "What can men of our
type do?"</p>

<p>(It might have been a echo, an third of a century later, of
Father Whitlow's: "What can you <i>do</i> with a boy like
that?")</p>

<p>"Protest, resist, disobey, suffer, carry on to the last moment,"
said Norvel. "We could at least do that. I intend to become more
and more insubordinate&mdash;to take his pictures out of the
schools, to drop his salutes, to teach history faithfully. Half my
teachers are with me in that."</p>

<p>"And if he strikes you down?"</p>

<p>"I shall be struck down. Such things have to happen. Some of my
teachers will certainly carry on."</p>

<p>Every characteristic of Norvel conspired to make him despise as
well as hate Rud. He was a man of immense practical ability, as
great or greater than Bodisham's, though he lacked the world
co-ordinator's imagination; but he had nothing of the one
commanding quality in Rud's composition, his rare flashes of social
and political insight. So that he missed the one quality in Rud
which had first attracted and bound the Group together. He despised
his incapacity for detail and he would not recognise his occasional
inspirations. Rud, Norvel thought, was just a needless accessory to
the Revolution; he had not been necessary to its development; he
would not even concede him the honour due to a foetal membrane. He
jabbed his pen-nib into the table. "To hell with leaders," he said.
"Why do we endure them? To hell with dictators and every form of
monarchy. Why cannot we agree to kill this little beast and have
done with him, and get on with our work?"</p>

<p>"<i>How?</i>" reiterated Heming. "How?"</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; IX</h3>

<p class="first">Deep down in Rud's heart, suppressed and denied,
stirred a profound conviction in complete agreement with Norvel's
question. Why did no one kill him? He had had this feeling ever
since the death of Chiffan, and sometimes it forced itself up
almost to definite realisation. He perceived an increasing quality
of menace in his bearing towards the people about him, though he
tried to soften it with a spasmodic geniality and familiarity, he
sensed that he was becoming too much for them and surely therefore,
he decided, they must be whispering and scheming his death&mdash;as
in similar circumstances he would have whispered and schemed. Of
course, they were trying to kill him. They would try to do it
unobtrusively, but they would do it.</p>

<p>He surrounded himself with precautions. He was amazed already at
the recklessness with which he had exposed himself to
Chiffan&mdash;if Chiffan had decided to stab or shoot. He had not
thought of that. In his natural, generous way he had let the
threatened man come to him. That must not happen again. Henceforth
guards must hover invisibly about him and behind them other trusty
guards must watch to see they attempted no treason upon him. But
precautions were not enough for Rud. He had never been able to wait
for an attack. The tension of his long wait for Reedly had been a
torture to him. His instinct was to strike first and unexpectedly.
So now he spent a considerable amount of nervous energy, peering so
to speak into the world about him, to detect any possible gathering
of conspirators against his Revolution and himself. He wanted to
destroy every stratum of recalcitrance in the world, before it
could assemble a definite attack upon him.</p>

<p>Christianity he had always detested, and his persecution of its
assemblies and formal worship was now intensified. Quite a number
of young, rather stupid men who might otherwise have gone from the
cradle to the grave unlit by any touch of nobility, died like
saints and heroes under the secret interrogations of Rothberg. Then
Rud chanced upon a book about the Jesuits and realised that they
constituted a special and efficient branch of the Christian
campaign against modern enlightenment. The spirit of Loyola had
been revived by the Church's disasters, and to their energy and
efficiency he attributed the exasperating phenomenon of a vanishing
Pope. He had wanted to offer rewards for the Pope, "properly
authenticated, dead or alive," but Thirp had dissuaded him. From
the Jesuits his imagination passed to Freemasonry. That mysterious
body also has been suitable material always for the politically
suspicious, and it required quite a lot of research before he
unearthed its secret, which was that it had no secret at all, and
was one thing here and another there, and nothing in particular, a
mere excuse for assemblies.</p>

<p>Then the searchlight of his suspicions swung round upon the
Jews. It swung round upon them and centred and settled upon them.
In his earlier years he had adopted a very liberal attitude towards
the Jews, if only on account of the indisputable "race" of his
maternal grandmother. But now the chosen people drew his attention
again. It flickered away from them and returned; for indeed they
are a peculiar people. Focussed, the Jew became a burning centre of
mental inflammation. When all the rest of the world was becoming
one community, why did they still cling to their peculiarities of
food and observance? It was odd, he said in the daylight, and that
was all there was to it. It was odd, he said in the troubled hours
of a sleepless night, and at once the old witch of dreamland set
about supplying nightmare explanations of this oddity. From which
dreamland he came trailing clouds of vague distrust about him, into
the common light of day.</p>

<p>Once he was started on that slippery slope he could not get the
Jewish question out of his head. It became an obsession. It became
the nucleus of a tangle of fear-born impulses to extravagant
violence. Assuredly there was something wrong about the persistent
separateness of these people. He discussed them with Gentiles who
were interested in them, and most of the Gentiles who were
interested in them disliked them, because it is not reasonable for
a modern intelligence to be interested in Jewish particularism
without a resentful irritation. Gradually the conviction grew upon
him that all Jewry constituted a conspiracy, though it was never
quite clear in his mind what the conspiracy was about. Nobody could
tell him what the conspiracy was about, or whether it was as
non-existent as the secret of the Freemasons. They were just a
peculiar people, to their own and the universal discomfort. That
made that unknown, hidden objective all the more sinister. It was
impossible to believe that they were still genuinely worried about
the Exodus from Egypt or the Captivity or the destruction of
Jerusalem. Yet still they seemed to brood and wail over these
things and bear a grudge against the Gentiles on account of them.
There was surely something more immediate behind this affectation
of remote sorrows. But what was it? They impressed him as a savage
is impressed by an inexplicable incantation. They made him feel
uncomfortable and apprehensive...</p>

<p>So in the brain of the World Trustee the potentiality of an
ultimate pogrom accumulated. And Jews themselves supplied all the
food that was necessary for his conspiracy mania to grow. As ever,
there were Jews demanding differential treatment and preparing
themselves for that perennial surprise which has pursued them
through the ages, of finding that this differential treatment, when
it comes, is not preferential. The more intelligent Jews were
assimilating rapidly to common mankind, but an obstinate remnant
persisted, and the more it became a remnant the more it felt it
fulfilled its destiny.</p>

<p>"It's that damned Bible, with its Chosen People poison. Isaiah
was the first and the worst of all the Nazis!" said Rud. "Until
that book is stamped out and forgotten, the Jews and Christians
will coagulate and re-coagulate about it...You don't understand,
Norvel."</p>

<p>Norvel declared that the new generation of Jews were as much
ashamed of Isaiah as the new generation of Germans were ashamed of
the Hitler period and the Nordic legend. "Educate," said
Norvel.</p>

<p>Rud would not have it. He appealed to sayings and doings of the
remnant. "Why do they go on being Jews at all now?" he said. "Why
do they keep it up? All through history the Jew has been hunted
like a dog with the Bible tied like an old tin can to his tail. Why
can't they cut away from that old tin can, now that they have a
chance? I want to free them. Just as much as I want to free the
rest of the world. What is the good of pretending that Judaism
isn't a conspiracy against human unity? Read their Holy Books, man!
Read Isaiah."</p>

<p>It was only too evident he had been reading Isaiah.</p>

<p>He closed synagogues, he prohibited the printing of Bible or
Talmud in spite of Norvel's remonstrances, he began to provoke the
younger Jews to defiance and heroism just as he had provoked the
Neo-Christians to heroic martyrdoms. Everywhere his attacks were
reviving these moribund religions as convenient centres of
resistance to his deification. They dared to do as members of a
sect what they did not dare to do as individuals. History, in its
loose, inaccurate way, was repeating itself. They would not burn
incense to Divus Caesar.</p>

<p>"Don't heed them," said Norvel. "They will assimilate. They
<i>are</i> assimilating. It is just a dwindling cult now of old
ladies, old rabbis, sentimentalists, eccentrics, Zang wills, men
with caricature profiles which they cannot escape, professional
champions, who keep the old Promise alive. They're like those
Druids who meet at Stonehenge on Midsummer morning. Leave them in
peace. They will pass. Judaism will pass as all things pass. Leave
it to <i>them</i> to come over."</p>

<p>"Jews never assimilate," said Rud, regardless of his maternal
grandmother. "Once a Jew always a Jew."</p>

<p>And then when Norvel was about to speak, Rud went on. "Maybe
there are fewer Jews," he said. "But these Christianised Jews
become Neo-Christians. All of them. You haven't observed that. I
have. <i>They're</i> not a dying breed. They go on. Christianity
always has been a Jewish sect."</p>

<p>"But," protested Norvel, "the Christian idea is the exact
opposite of Judaism. Christianity is the broadest universalism;
Judaism the narrowest nationalism. Everything you and I need and
care for can be put in terms of this Neo-Christianity."</p>

<p>"You ask me to believe that!" shouted Rud, pacing up and down
the room, and stopping with outstretched fingers to make his
points. "You ask me to believe that! Then <i>why</i> the Bible
still? Yes&mdash;you'll talk about the Old Dispensation and the New
Dispensation. You know that's a quibble as well as I do. You say
they are as opposite as the poles. You pretend Christianity is a
Gentile religion. Why! even after the Crucifixion, after it was all
over, after the Resurrection and everything, still for a time none
of them breathed a word about letting in the Gentiles. Not a word.
That came later, with Paul and all those animals Peter saw in a
sheet&mdash;what was that vision? Not a word from the Founder...I
ask you! He comes to earth to make religion universal&mdash;and he
forgets to mention it! Eh? Not much of a story, that!"</p>

<p>"There was the story of the Good Samaritan," said Norvel, but
Rud's voice overrode him.</p>

<p>"New Dispensation, they say! The more the Jews and the
Christians differ, the more they remain the same thing. Why do the
Christians trail that old Bible about with them, if they have
outgrown it? Why don't they denounce it plainly? Why do they still
read the Psalms and the Prophets in church? Answer me that! You
can't. Every Christian, I tell you, is a Jew or a Jew
proselyte."</p>

<p>The gleam of mania appeared in Rud's eyes&mdash;but his voice
became gentle and persuasive. He appealed to Norvel as a man might
appeal to a child with incredible delusions. "Are you blind,
Norvel?" he said. "Do you really and truly think that Christianity
changes Jews? Not a bit of it. It disguises them. It makes them
more than ever the same thing. Why are there so few Jews? Because
there are so many Christians. The Jews breed and breed and never
increase. Isn't it plain? They're in the other Warren. All that is
left of the Christian Churches to-day is three parts crypto-Jew.
Three parts, I tell you. You will see. You will see&mdash;One fine
day something will happen to me, Norvel, something will happen to
me...Something will happen to my Revolution...<i>They'll</i> manage
it. Unless we strike first."</p>

<p>He walked away to a window and came back. He brought his hot
face close to Norvel's and Norvel hoped that his own expression
would not betray his eager wish that something should happen to
Rud.</p>

<p>"And then, then at last, at last, when they think the time is
ripe, they will push one of the real race into my place, and you
will have a Jew World Dictator, a Jew Emperor&mdash;a Son of David,
Lord of the World! Solomon, with wives and concubines, all
complete. So that the Promise shall be fulfilled, and the Jews
inherit the Earth! That is the eternal dream of the Jews and they
will go on dreaming it. What else can they be dreaming
about?...Unless we deal with them, Norvel&mdash;now..."</p>

<p>So far Rud was following in the footsteps of his German
precursor, Hitler, in his attack on the Jewish riddle, but it is to
be remarked that, quite unlike Hitler, he never betrayed any traces
of that physical race mania which is so frequent an aspect of the
pogrom complex. He regarded the Jews as a conspiracy. Hitler felt
them as a biological pressure, multiplying around him and his kind.
He bore a personal sexual hate for them. But Rud had no sense of
race. It was not the Jewish race he hated, it was the Jewish
idea.</p>

<p>"Stamp it out, stamp it all out now," he would mutter between
sleeping and waking. He would lie in bed pursuing a reverie that
passed into a nightmare of triumphant violence. Should he make them
renounce the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob? In so many words?
Would an enforced renunciation be enough? He planned a world-wide
Sicilian Vespers&mdash;Jews and Christians butchered together. No
ghetto seclusion, no exile, would satisfy his imagination. It would
have to be a world-wide terror this time, a cumulative
massacre...</p>

<p>Whom should he use? Whom could he trust? How could he prepare
for this last and final world purge, get thousands of people
straining at the leash, and yet take these doomed Bible cultures by
surprise? The Pogrom would have to burst simultaneously throughout
the earth. It must be like the fall of some tremendous meteorite.
Out of a blue sky. Abruptly in every cinema he would appear, full
of menace, advancing, filling the picture, until there was nothing
to be seen but his eyes and nothing to be heard but his voice
roaring in their ears, drowning every other sound. Or should he
appear in great effigies thrown across the smoke-screened heavens?
Everywhere all over the world the loud-speakers would shout
together with one terrible voice: "The Day of Wrath, the Day of the
Wrath of Rud, has come." They would hear what was coming to them in
the cinemas, in the market-places, in their homes. That voice, that
face of hatred, would pursue them everywhere.</p>

<p>Everywhere too Rothberg's police, reinforced a thousandfold,
would be picking out the special victims. This time there would be
no place to shelter them, anywhere on earth. Earth and air would
howl against them. <i>Conspuez</i>&mdash;what a good word that was!
His reveries became more and more gigantically apocalyptic.
Mountains were thrown about like ninepins. The seas were tinged
with blood. No more Jews. No more Jehovah.</p>

<p>More and more did he brood on this crowning surprise for
mankind. It began with him as a dream; then it became a wilful
imagination which he would conjure up at will. "Rud," he whispered.
"Thud. Thunder." They thought he had done what he had to do, did
they? They thought he was played out. He'd show them. Why! He was
only beginning. Wait just a little...</p>

<p>He would wander about his carefully guarded apartments and
gardens. He would come to a standstill, a small, dark figure in
some vertically tremendous archway. Far off stood Rothberg's
unobtrusive, trustworthy men shielding him from danger. He would
sit alone on his terrace, elaborating it all. He whistled thinly
through his teeth just as he had done when as a boy he had wandered
over the countryside fighting imaginary battles...</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; X</h3>

<p class="first">It was not merely the planning of the last and
greatest of all pogroms that fevered the now almost unsleeping
brain of Rud. It was indeed the dominant theme of his disordered
mind, but at times it receded to give place to narrower, intenser
moods of uncontrollable distrust. Perpetual vigilance is the seed
of madness. It trails a perpetual wakefulness. His mind was
festering now with suspicion whenever two or three were gathered
together in any sort of co-operation.</p>

<p>Every sort of association made him uneasy, every professional
solidarity made him uneasy. He had never subdued his fear of
medical men after that vindictive trial and execution of Bodisham's
doctors. He felt all the doctors were now his enemies. Then there
were men of science. The physicists, the mathematicians, seemed
tame cats for the most part; the biologists, the psychologists were
more outspoken; but they all hung together. They, too, he felt, had
their shibboleths, their hidden understandings. They, too, looked
at him now with incommunicable thoughts in their eyes.</p>

<p>He suspected even the teachers of mathematics and physics.
Olders found him one day crouched together, sitting on his feet in
a big arm-chair in his bureau, puzzling over a text-book of
mathematical crystallography, trying to detect the treason behind
the pinacoids.</p>

<p>His doctors he subjected to the most searching questioning. He
was always consulting fresh ones secretly and then confronting them
with any apparent contradiction from the diagnoses he had extracted
from their fellow-experts. His general malaise increased. He was
ceasing to eat as well as ceasing to sleep.</p>

<p>At this stage, with a profound distrust of all other doctors,
suddenly he bethought himself of Carstall and turned to him.</p>

<p>In spite of his flatterers and worshippers, in spite of his
growing sense of divinity, Rud had still a curious feeling about
Carstall left over from the days of Hooplady House, a faint,
exalted, snobbishness. It came to him now as a thing supremely
desirable that Carstall should be willing to stand over him and
fend off these impalpable treacheries that menaced him. He had
always wanted Carstall to care for him&mdash;from their earliest
meeting. Now he decided that Carstall should indeed care for
him&mdash;that Carstall should leave whatever else he happened to
be doing at the time and become Rud's personal attendant.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XI</h3>

<p class="first">Carstall regarded the Master of the World, and
behold he was still the Stink and the sickly-faced orator in the
Camford Union, exalted but the same. That little tadpole of a boy
with the large head had simply grown to cosmic proportions, and all
that remained now of the bold oratorical quality that had swept
undergraduate Camford off its feet was something wordily shabby. He
affected a stern dignity and it did not suit his fragile smallness.
His looks hadn't improved, his eyes were bright with mania and
bloodshot, they seemed to have sunken deeper into their sockets,
and his voice was harsher. Master of the world!</p>

<p>Carstall received his instructions with an expressionless face.
He nodded gravely to a recital of symptoms and asked a few
questions. Rud urged him to come into personal attendance
forthwith.</p>

<p>"No," said Carstall. "You must come into my clinic. It is not
thirty miles from here&mdash;you know&mdash;near my house opposite
that great cliff on the bend of the Gorge of the Loup. You need
continuous supervision. You've been overdoing the strychnine."</p>

<p>"How did you know?"</p>

<p>"Everyone nowadays under such stresses as yours takes strychnine
in some form. But I think I know what to do with you. I want you
under close observation and control. And to be frank, I can trust
my own staff, but I'm not so sure <i>here</i>."</p>

<p>"You haven't <i>seen</i> anything definite?" asked the Director
with a flash of wild suspicion in his eyes, that vanished almost as
soon as it came. "If you think there is anyone."</p>

<p>"No. But this is, what shall I call it?&mdash;an office-palace.
Where there is a concentration of power in the hands of any single
man, there is intrigue. Politics blow in like draughts here
whenever a window opens. For a time at least I want to forget what
you are and treat you as a case."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad of a rest," said Rud, consenting.</p>

<p>"That you shall have," said Carstall.</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XII</h3>

<p class="first">"He came to me too late," said Carstall. "He had
gone too far. He had to die."</p>

<p>"Who knows of it?" asked Olders with white lips.</p>

<p>"I do. Krause, the analyst, and his staff. We have only men
nurses here. Do you want to hush it up for a day or so? It can be
done, you know."</p>

<p>"It is a catastrophe. Nothing is ready. Anyone may seize
power."</p>

<p>"I will issue a bulletin that he is emerging from a crisis and
must remain insensible for forty-eight&mdash;or say, sixty hours.
And then we can have a phase of coma before the end. Meanwhile
suppose you as secretary stop all these pending executions."</p>

<p>"You think?"</p>

<p>"I am sure. And you add as a note to my report&mdash;not
stressed but as a matter of course&mdash;that otherwise everyone,
everywhere, carries on&mdash;as usual. If there is no sudden shock
things will go by inertia. For a time anyhow."</p>

<p>"You think?" said Olders.</p>

<p>"Sure of it. I'm in control here. I can answer for this end. And
by the by, there are certain medical formalities&mdash;There must
be no suspicion about his death, you know."</p>

<p>He insisted upon a searching post-mortem and this was carried
out by the great analyst Krause with his assistants. Carstall had
suggested that either strychnine or arsenic would appear, but the
autopsy revealed nothing. "Sheer overwork then," said Carstall, and
the faithful Olders bowed his head and murmured, "He died for us
all."</p>

<p>"He died for us all," Carstall agreed.</p>

<p>"We are still keeping back the fact of his death," said Olders
next day. "I&mdash;have given a hint here and there."</p>

<p>"Who knows?" asked Carstall.</p>

<p>Olders looked reluctant but not treacherous.</p>

<p>"One or two possible successors have to be watched," he
said.</p>

<p>"I am going to bring in three fresh experts and have the body
embalmed. They, too, are absolutely trustworthy. No one will know
they have come here. And then, why not wait a little? A pickled
dictator is better than a living dog-fight."</p>

<p>Plainly Olders was shocked.</p>

<p>"Sorry," said Carstall, "but there was no one like him. Was
there? The succession was never settled. He kept us guessing. No
rational man wants a world civil war. In this sprawling new-born
world now&mdash;it would be unending. There would be Caesars here
and Caesars there. Nationalism isn't dead yet; it's scorched in the
grass. We might be carried back to that old world again...If once
it starts. But it needn't start...And nowadays does anyone
considerable, really want Power? As power. <i>You</i> don't want to
be his successor. You want to go on as a sort of world secretary.
As you can. And you don't want any particular one of the possible
successors very badly. Do you?...<i>No</i>. I thought so. Neither
do I. Suppose we take his embalmed body back home in an ambulance
and put him to bed in his own room at the executive centre. Suppose
you go on being his secretary."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't dare."</p>

<p>"If I stand by you. If presently you find others standing by
you. All the strings are in your hands. Nobody else has your
executive knowledge. The castle there is like the centre of a
spider's web. You were loyal to him. You believed in him. Believe
in him still and keep this new world united and at peace. We will
help you."</p>

<p>"There are competent men in the world still. None of these
would-be successors dare move in the dark. They're a poor lot. Not
like those fresh, raw Dictators of the twenties and thirties. I
know their quality. The conditions have changed. Tell everyone to
carry on. And get Norvel here. Norvel particularly."</p>

<p>"But who are <i>we?</i>"</p>

<p>"The men in the various World Controls&mdash;Bellacourt, Roots,
Heming, Holbank, Sen, Lacoste, Rurik, Norvel, men like that. In
love with their jobs. They'll all carry on if they can. It's in
their make. Not one of them is a power politician. It's amazing how
financiers and politicians have died out in the last few years.
You'd have thought the breed was eternal. I did as a young man. But
the desire for mere power&mdash;either in the form of money or as
direct control&mdash;seems to have evaporated. Reedly had it, and
Thirp, in his own peculiar twisted way."</p>

<p>He checked himself on the verge of adding "Rud".</p>

<p>"It's the natural desire of a not very social animal forced into
a society too large for it and frightening it. But now we are
getting a sort of security, and the impulse to hoard up power is
assuaged. The Dictators eliminated the power of finance, and now
here, if you will, is the end of political power. Concentrated into
an individual, then into a spot, now into a mathematical point,
nothingness."</p>

<p>He closed and clenched his hand. Was he saying too much for
Olders? He stared at him and felt reassured.</p>

<p>"A dictator, Olders," he said, "seems to be necessary whenever
there is a broad readjustment of human relationships. Apparently a
major power system is necessary to destroy any minor power system
that preceded the readjustment or arose out of it. Hence there must
be a dictatorship. But no dictatorship can go on indefinitely. This
isn't a new discovery&mdash;at least not a very new one. They're
teaching it, <i>sub rosa</i>, now, in the new universities. But
Lenin, who was head and shoulders above his generation, saw far
beyond anyone else at that time, into these inevitable phases that
have to follow a revolution. His language was clumsy, he spoke with
a strong Marxist accent, but he had the heart of the Power question
clear. This now is what Lenin was trying to foretell when he talked
of the disappearance of the state. Here it was." He held out the
fist he had clenched and opened it wide and wiped the palm with his
other hand. "Presto, it has gone!"</p>

<p>Olders assented silently.</p>

<p>"Stalin reversed all that," said Carstall. "Stalin went back on
Lenin because he did not understand this."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Olders.</p>

<p>"The man to take hold of this situation now is Norvel. And
between ourselves, thank God Thirp is dead." Olders nodded
agreement.</p>

<p>"Who is there to make trouble if you and Norvel and all of us
say simply 'Carry on'? There's not the shadow of a Reedly in sight,
and all that nationalist Federation stuff is just fading out of
men's minds. Rothberg? That blood-stained little ferret! No...You
think he'll just hide? So do I. He'd better.</p>

<p>"If there was another possible leader, would he have a following
now? All the conditions have changed. The world is busy. There's
few idle hands or people and the ones there are, are scattered.
Common people don't want trouble now. They're full of hope. In the
days before the Revolution they were full of resentment. They
relieved it, and the time for Revolution is over. There is no
earthly reason whatever for another Dictator in the
world&mdash;none. Not for centuries. Now that common sense has got
itself organised and unified it is mere common sense to abolish an
individual head even as a symbol...</p>

<p>"So. Let the Master Director sleep and sleep, and then let him
pass into a coma&mdash;and need that coma ever end? He has done his
work. He was deadly tired. It is amazing but true; he has destroyed
so much, so many irritating boundaries, so many poisonous
traditions, that he has united the world unawares. Why should we
not go on now&mdash;with an embalmed dictator?...I mean it,
Olders.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they had something of that sort in their minds in
Russia when they embalmed Lenin. Years ago I saw him once, lying
there in the little mausoleum outside the Kremlin wall, like a man,
a rather tired little chap, asleep. But Trotsky and Zinoviev and
Stalin and Co. had not the loyalty to carry on together. That
Russian gang seems to have been a poor band of
egotists&mdash;tortuous self-justifying egotists&mdash;not good
enough for anything of that sort. And the Russian community was
anaemic and overstrained. Now comes a chance of trying it again
with all the sane men in the world to draw upon&mdash;and people
busy. People, Olders, are busy. Busy. Hang on to that. He was
beginning to scare them, but <i>now</i>, they will forget these
last bad years."</p>

<p>"Do I dare?" said Olders.</p>

<p>"What else can you do, Olders? There's no possible successor who
wouldn't shoot you within a year."</p>

<p>"Of course <i>I</i> have thought that the world now was, so to
speak, a going concern again," said Olders. "<i>He</i> cleared away
so much...You put it all with such confidence...Almost"&mdash;he
paused for the smallest fraction of a second&mdash;"almost as if
you have thought it out beforehand."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; XIII</h3>

<p class="first">Norvel became at once a central figure of the
reconstituted Group of administrators who now took charge of the
world's affairs, and he showed the liveliest curiosity about the
last hours of Rud. He insisted upon having the fullest particulars
of his last illness from Carstall and his assistant Krause, and
while he did so he looked hard at Carstall. But Carstall met his
enquiring eye imperturbably and agreed that the cause of death was
quite obscure. "Krause here," he said, "did the post-mortem. He
<i>ransacked</i> the body."</p>

<p>"I want to see the body," said Norvel. "I want to see the body
for my own good."</p>

<p>"We are going to treat him very much as they treated Lenin,"
said Carstall. "He has been embalmed, and presently all the world
will be able to come here, like pilgrims, and see him for
themselves."</p>

<p>Until the Mausoleum could be prepared Rud lay upon a slab in the
clinic, and thither went Norvel and Carstall. The chief embalmer
met and accompanied them and gave a few unnecessary explanations;
then, having no reason to remain, he departed. Norvel regarded the
yellow and waxy visage of the departed autocrat with tranquil
distaste. Carstall was absolutely expressionless. "He's nothing
much to see," said Norvel.</p>

<p>"They will want to see him," said Carstall.</p>

<p>Norvel had made his hostility to Rud no secret from Carstall.
And Carstall had neither agreed nor dissented.</p>

<p>"To think of it!" said Norvel. Carstall turned silently
attentive to hear what Norvel had to say.</p>

<p>"To think that such a creature should have terrified the world
and made millions of normal men quibble and lie! Completest
surrender of their dignity! And scores of millions, hundreds of
millions, made a sort of God of him! To think of it!"</p>

<p>He grunted and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Carstall, the other day I routed out his eldest
brother Sam&mdash;and I got some realistic reminiscences of our
God-Caesar out of him. Sam hated him. Always had hated him. Told me
how he used to sit on his little pot in the nursery and threaten
his brothers about what he would do to them directly he'd done.
They used to make faces at him. And there was a story of a mess in
the corner, the pot tilted over or something broke in some sort of
scuffle, and that is why they called him the Stink. I forget the
exact particulars already. I didn't think them as funny as brother
Sam did. I thought they were nasty and pitiful. But evidently he
was like that.</p>

<p>"I don't blame him very much for becoming Dictator of the World,
Carstall, but, by God! I feel sick at the crawling of the millions
before him. Was it really the snake that God condemned to go on its
belly all the days of its life? Or the other party? I'm not so
sure. Perhaps both parties were in default...</p>

<p>"It takes the heart out of life to think of all that
subservience. I do what I can to respect myself. I make a brave
story about myself. I tell myself I am doing my share in the making
of a new mankind. I keep it up that we educators and biologists are
setting out now to breed and educate a race of
gods&mdash;statesmen, teachers, thinkers (as we used to call them),
poets. And then I think of the recent history of mankind! I think
how a thing like that thing lying dead there can lead them to war
or worship or massacre! Mankind! Mud! Shall we ever do more than
make mud pies out of them? What else can you do with mud? Educated
mud is still mud. Adam was mud and all his seed are mud.</p>

<p>"And that is how you feel about it?" said Carstall. "You have
the makings of a fine late-Georgian poet in you, Norvel. Did you
ever contribute to their paper?&mdash;<i>The Criterion</i>, wasn't
it? No? There ought to be a refrain to this little song of yours,
'<i>Let us get drunk</i>.' Does this mean you give up your
mud-modelling work? Resign the directorate of education?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," said Norvel. "What else is there for me to
do?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Carstall.</p>

<p>"Conceiving what you say as a mere passing mood about mankind, I
am inclined to agree with you," said Carstall. "But mud is mixed
stuff and even in <i>that</i>&mdash;" he nodded to the embalmed
Dictator "&mdash;there were some bright gleams."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap4_03" name="chap4_03"></a>III. &mdash;
POST-MORTEM</h2>

<h3>&sect; I</h3>

<p class="first">Krause had refused one or two invitations to visit
Carstall in the new home the latter had made for himself near
Gourdon in Eastern Provence. At a fourth intimation he went. He had
seen very little of his former teacher since the death of the
Master Director, ten years before. He had gone to preside over the
big Research Station at Chicken Itza in Maya land, and his work on
the latent infections in these jungle sites had been subtle and
fruitful.</p>

<p>Carstall was installed in a modernised castle that was built
into the cliff of Gourdon, looking down on the gorge of the Loup.
He had given up active practice for some years and had reverted to
certain problems of physiological chemistry from which he had been
diverted during the economic collapse that had preceded the War of
the Ideologies. So far he had published no results of very
commanding originality. He had a very lovely wife, dark-eyed and
still, she was fully a dozen years younger than himself, and she
had given him three boys and a daughter.</p>

<p>Husband and wife were evidently upon the most affectionate
terms, they could not meet without some trifling caress, but it
seemed to Krause that they talked very little. Once or twice he saw
her looking at her husband with a gentle scrutiny, as though she
felt unsure of him and of what he might do next. It seemed odd to
Krause that he should be aware of this and Carstall apparently
unaware, or else so used to it as to be indifferent to it. It was
as if beneath the general candour of his bearing he had kept
something essential, some belief or disbelief, some habit of
thought or action, out of that relationship, and that she felt that
incompleteness.</p>

<p>Krause sympathised with Mrs. Carstall and thought Carstall ought
to have lived or behaved or done something different to avoid this
faint but perceptible aloofness. Perhaps the disparity in their
years had been too wide a gap to bridge, or perhaps the very love
they had for one another was a barrier between them. Krause had
seen that happen before. Passionate love, which can bring two
humans closer than breathing, can at the same time keep them worlds
apart. Krause was one of those quiet, observant, unaggressive men
who go about sympathising mutely with pretty women, and
particularly with the wives of their friends, but who never think
of themselves in the r&ocirc;le of lover. He thought all men were
unworthy of women and he made no exception of himself. Which left
his sympathies unhampered.</p>

<p>He thought all men unworthy of women and generally his estimates
of his friends were qualified. He never allowed this to appear in
his demeanour, but it was a private consolation for his own sense
of inadequacy.</p>

<p>Krause had begun as Carstall's pupil and the tone of their old
relationship of mentor and enquirer still flavoured their
intercourse. Krause was a subtle and original worker, but his
make-up had an ineradicable junior quality, and by nature Carstall
was a sixth-form boy. So Carstall usually had the conversational
lead. And it presently became clear to Krause that Carstall had a
bias for talking about the Master Director.</p>

<p>By imperceptible degrees Krause apprehended what was coming.</p>

<p>They were sitting together after lunch one afternoon on the
terrace, indolently aware of the mountainous loveliness spread out
before their eyes. Nice could be seen through a thin veil like a
burst sack of microscopic crystals poured down a slope, and far
beneath in the gorge the Loup was a thin, bright-blue line winding
its way down through a nearer wilderness of crests, cliffs and
wooded slopes towards the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Carstall reverted again to Rud. What was Rud's significance in
the world? What had he achieved? Had his work been done when he
died? At last he blurted out what he wanted to say, speaking with
an affectation of casualness: "Did you know it, Krause?&mdash;I
killed him."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; II</h3>

<p class="first">So he had said it at last.</p>

<p>All the muscles of Krause seemed to tighten. For a space he was
silent. Then he said: "<i>I</i> thought you killed him&mdash;until
I made the autopsy."</p>

<p>"I saw you did at the time. That is why I insisted on the
autopsy."</p>

<p>"But how did you manage it? How <i>could</i> you have killed
him?"</p>

<p>"You suspected me?"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;yes. Arsenic. There was that curious depression of
his spirits before the end&mdash;and the fluttering heart. But my
autopsy yielded nothing. There wasn't a trace. Of anything."</p>

<p>Carstall studied Krause's pensive profile.</p>

<p>"There were tons of arsenic in him. His body had to be soaked in
it. After all that strychnine he'd had...Primitive, I admit, but it
happened to be convenient."</p>

<p>"Then <i>how?</i>"</p>

<p>"Can you remember now after ten years, how, where and when you
made your tests?"</p>

<p>"I've been over it time and again in my mind."</p>

<p>"That does not always improve a memory. But let me refresh the
facts for you. We took our material from the body together. You had
every facility in the hospital laboratory. Yes...But in the
hospital patients die every day."</p>

<p>Krause turned his face to Carstall, in surprised
interrogation.</p>

<p>"Yes. While you and your assistant were busy with your
reagents," said Carstall, "I handed you fresh material. From
another subject. I had it ready. Yes. You did all a man could do
under the circumstances. And your assistants checked your results.
I have always felt, Krause, you could not be trusted with a
secret&mdash;with that secret anyhow. At that time your scientific
habit of telling the truth might have caused a lot of trouble.
Everything might have gone to pieces. Some adventurer would have
got people excited. I might have been shot. And I did not want to
be shot."</p>

<p>Krause made a weak sound of protest.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I should have been shot. But now as this new regime
settles down it does not matter. At last, thank the stars, I can
talk. Even if you ran out now and denounced me nobody would believe
you after all this time. It had to be done. He was hopelessly mad
at last. He was frantic with vanity and fear. There was no other
way with him...No way that I could imagine...I did right in killing
him...He might have gone on disintegrating for years...And
murdering and degrading other people...Putting everything wrong
again. Spoiling his job. I killed him to save what he had
done...</p>

<p>"Did you know, he was my schoolfellow? No? He was. I was head
boy in the same school and I tried to prevent the other fellows
calling him The Stink. It was a sort of link between us...</p>

<p>"I don't think I ever liked him very much, Krause, but he had, I
know, a sort of unsatisfied desire to&mdash;to come it over me. I
<i>mattered</i> to him. I felt that&mdash;and I confess it
made&mdash;what I did to him&mdash;a little more difficult...And
then there were the traditions of the profession. Good traditions.
He was a patient...</p>

<p>"But I had seen his pencil list for the next massacre. He
scribbled it in bed in the clinic...And there was that Chiffan
story. That hardened my heart. Chiffan had been his closest friend.
No one was safe from him at last. There was nothing for it but to
finish him...I think about him a good deal. What did <i>you</i>
think of him, Krause?"</p>

<p>"He impressed me as a very Great Man. I don't think anything can
change that impression."</p>

<p>"I suppose...So far as there are great men...You admit he was
mad?"</p>

<p>"At the last. But consider the immense things he did! The
magnificent sweep of his imagination. His inflexible will!"</p>

<p>"I suppose he was a necessary evil."</p>

<p>"He was the supreme super-man. If you could look at him, not
with the eyes of an old school-fellow but with the eyes of the
world. Hundreds of millions worshipped him."</p>

<p>"You will never really grow up, Krause. Numbers mean
nothing."</p>

<p>"Even now, forgive me, Carstall, I feel a sort of horror...At
what I had to do to him...Even <i>you</i>..."</p>

<p>"But then you are fifteen years younger than I am, Krause, and
when you grew up he was already a great light in the sky...</p>

<p>"You would have told...</p>

<p>"I realise more than ever how right I was to keep my own
counsel. And anyhow, you know, I had no right to drag you in. Or
anyone else. Before or after. It was no slight to you, Krause. I
had to do it on my own, absolutely on my own."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; III</h3>

<p class="first">"Sometimes," said Krause, "I am afraid of
you."</p>

<p>Carstall sat silent with the corners of his mouth tucked in. He
knew that Krause was not in the least afraid of him. Why should he
be?</p>

<p>Carstall dismissed the topic of Krause and his fear. The vision
of a dirty-faced little boy miserably and viciously jabbing a
penholder at his school-mate occupied his mind. He had not thought
of Rud in that way for years.</p>

<p>"The Stink," he said at last, and then weighing the one word
against the other: "Superman? Divus Caesar? The truth I suppose
lies in between...</p>

<p>"The fact is, Krause, I am right about his quality and you are
right about his scale. Poor little devil he was, just a poor little
murderous devil at heart and he was blown out by the chances of
life, as little urchins used to blow out frogs. Just a nasty,
frightened kid, greedy but frightened, horribly afraid of violence,
always in a panic, living in an age of panic and expanded a
million, a billion times. Until in a world of utter cowardice, he
filled the sky. He killed a multitude of people, he destroyed
institutions, traditions, boundaries, in his terror and praise the
stars! they were institutions that had to be destroyed. Or at least
he was the instrument&mdash;</p>

<p>"Those dear old institutions, social classes, private property,
religious cant, patriotism!...They had become shelters for every
slinking meanness in the human make-up.</p>

<p>"I have watched these Dictators from their beginning when I was
a schoolboy, to now when they are all over and done with. I've
lived through it all. And the books! The lying, cringing
Hero-worship! All these fellows had the same quality of being
driven to do something, feeling that they were creatures of
destiny, they all began like that, and then, not being able to
understand, not being able to give themselves simply to the thing
that gripped them, they went mad. History, Krause, is a case-book
for the alienist. Thus far. All began as demagogues, all of them
began like men aware of and feeling for and being used by some
drive&mdash;Rud was driven highest and furthest. He was the
ultimate dictator. I compared him just now to a frog blown out by
an urchin...Yes...But what was it really, Krause, that inflated
him?...What was it, Krause?"</p>

<p>"Call it the Spirit of Mankind," said Krause.</p>

<p>"Spirit of Mankind? Not a bit of it! Not even the Spirit of
Life...I don't care for that word, spirit...Forces of which we
still haven't the faintest understanding made him and used him. As
they made and use us. He had to live, it seems, and certainly he
had to be killed...His kind <i>asks</i> for killing and our sort
has to kill them...The pattern of life requires it. And as for the
pattern of life! How can we know? What can a man know of reality
beyond the life that is <i>in</i> him while he lives?</p>

<p>"Here after two brief generations of conflict and destruction we
are in a renascent world. No doubt now of the renascence. New
standards and a new scale. The Blood Dance of the Dictators quite
over and done. Dead already, all of them now, as dead as last
year's mutton. Think of their last days!...</p>

<p>"But they had to dance, of course. They had to dance in their
turn...</p>

<p>"We are going on to a new way of living altogether. Who can
doubt it? People may make another legend of our Rud, a greater
Caesar, a mightier Alexander? A Moses? Maybe they will. Yet I
question that. He had a pathetic greed for fame, had Rud. I hope he
isn't away somewhere in space, waiting for his press-cuttings...Or
eavesdropping on us...</p>

<p>"Queer lot these twentieth-century Dictators. They broke out
like wasps in a dry summer. Conditions favoured them. A peculiar
species they were. A crescendo of scavengers because the unadapted
world was rotten with shabby evasions and make-believes. It asked
for blow-flies and wasps. Not a loyalty, not a religion left that
was not dead and stinking. These Dictators were master stinks,
stinks like burning rubber and creosote, in a world of cowardly
skunks. Superficially like gangster chiefs, they were, or like the
pronunciamento bosses of those little old republics there used to
be in South America, or Greek tyrants. But only superficially. More
like Caesars, but not really like <i>them</i>. Spreading further
and less intense...In the human community, a difference in scale
means a difference in kind. As in most other things. They weren't
simply blown-out frogs, they were burst frogs, inflated to nothing
and burst; they were just the skins and faces of men.</p>

<p>"When these scientific historians who are coming along with
their biology and their psychology, when they have done with your
God-Caesar-Rud, Krause, he will be left with about as much
greatness and divinity and as little power over men's imaginations
as the wired-up skeleton of a deinosaur in a museum. Just a
memorial of reptilian energy, vestiges of a slobber in the mud.
Remarkable, but no precedent for us...</p>

<p>"Very anthropocentric our values are still...We still don't
stand up to the truth, Krause. Measured against infinity, is a
deinosaur any greater than an ant? The ratio is the same. Ants are
in the pattern of life just as much as deinosaurs&mdash;and our
noble selves. We're too snobbish. We do our brother under God, the
ant, an injustice. We blackball him for the Ethical Club. <i>We</i>
are spiritual, we say, and all that, while he's just a little bit
of clockwork instinct. The only <i>real</i> gentry, the Lords of
Creation, God's chosen animals are we! More particularly we of the
upper classes. <i>We</i> who crawled at the feet of the Dictators
and were too currish to make an end of war. Pink rats, Krause!
Diseased pink rats! If <i>we</i> had to be, then surely those great
handsome deinosauria and deinotheria <i>had</i> to be&mdash;they
had to play <i>their</i> part. The ants too are playing their part.
Every little ant. <i>Has</i> to. And the little Stink I knew at
school, playing <i>his</i> part, became the Marvel of Mankind.</p>

<p>"He ended war for ever. He did. He rationalised property and
money. He inaugurated the Age of Plenty. He reconstructed world
education. None of that was his original work. It had all been
thought of before. It was already there as the common-sense of
mankind. Much of it had not been simply thought of; it had been
thought out and planned. Bodisham digested it all for him. Only we
hadn't the courage and honesty. <i>He</i> was needed somehow to
make it real. He&mdash;<i>eventuated</i> it. After all he
had&mdash;a certain desperation. There was honesty in him, honesty
in the frantic fear that drove him on, honesty in his hate of
subjugation. He liberated and he was frightened by the freedoms he
had released. He did what he had to do, and doing it, lost touch
with his fellow-creatures. And at last he became a public danger
and we did not know what to do with him. Until the arsenic I gave
him made his poor little heart beat very fast and then stopped it
altogether. The Stink. Master of the World."</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; IV</h3>

<p class="first">Carstall tilted his chair back and with his hand
behind his head gazed serenely at the sky.</p>

<p>"Yes. You frighten me," said Krause, after a pause.</p>

<p>"You don't agree with my point of view, you mean?"</p>

<p>"I agree with you, Carstall. That's why I am afraid. I am afraid
of this clear, unsentimental life in you. And in so many of our
young people. A life consciously as small as an ant's maybe, but as
proud and self-reliant as God's. Where will it take us?"</p>

<p>"Beyond my particular limits, I don't know and I don't
care...<i>Now</i>...I did once...That, Krause, is what I mean by
that excellent phrase, Living by Faith. Live by faith in the
unknown pattern. What else can a reasonable man do? There <i>is</i>
a pattern. That is all I know...That is all you know, Krause...</p>

<p>"I have to be myself to the utmost, and none of my questions
will ever be answered. That is my creed. <i>Why</i> do we go on
living, Krause? <i>You don't know</i>. Neither do I. But we
<i>have</i> to go on living. <i>Could</i> we know? I doubt it.
Mysticism and Stoicism. We live in the dawn of a mystical and
stoical age. <i>Hard</i> perhaps by the old standards. Free of lots
of the old scruples but with new scruples, very exacting scruples
some of them, of its own. I like this new life around us and I wish
my old father could have lived to see it. I like what is happening.
It's a clear, fresh morning with the promise this time of a really
bright day...</p>

<p>"It's a great relief to talk to you like this, Krause. I've had
to keep this Rud business to myself for ten full years. Absolutely
to myself...I've continually been thinking of him...You'd be
surprised...He had to be killed, you know. He <i>had</i> to be
killed..."</p>

<p>Carstall paused, but Krause said nothing.</p>

<p>"I didn't like doing it. Why should I?"</p>

<p>Silence from Krause.</p>

<p>"I killed him because I knew that no one else among you had the
guts to do it. There was something&mdash;a prestige&mdash;about
him. But he had to be killed...</p>

<p>"After I killed him he became more important. That I have always
found rather queer, Krause. I began to ask myself what exactly it
was I had killed. Was he exceptional or was he a perfect sample of
what we all are? Stink and insight? Rats with unexploited brains?
Toads with jewels in their heads?</p>

<p>"That peculiar intelligence that he showed at times! In the
early days particularly. It seemed to be something almost entirely
independent of his personal self. As though his brain lit up.
Everyone who knew him says that. I suppose it's something of the
sort you get in real poets&mdash;or in cardinal men of science.
Like something hidden in the dark suddenly lit by a searchlight. As
though a higher mind is imprisoned somewhere behind the human
brain. Getting free now and then&mdash;partially.</p>

<p>"Presently, now that so much has been cleared up in the world,
it may get free more and more frequently. What do you think,
Krause? Suppose man is only just beginning to realise what he can
do with his brain? Or suppose our brains are only beginning to
realise what they can do with us? Or that some sort of brain behind
all brains...</p>

<p>"The world state in which we live isn't a magnified militant
sovereign state of the old type; it's something essentially
different, something new and better. Maybe this Man in Common is
something different too&mdash;not a man magnified, but men
aggregated, a super-man with larger thoughts and aims, something
not so much collective as quintessential. The real
<i>Leviathan</i>&mdash;not the State, as Hobbes had it, but man's
entire achievement."</p>

<p>The mind of Krause moved in a narrower orbit than Carstall's.
"It was a pity you had to do away with Rud. I see your case. But it
was a pity. It seems so&mdash;so ungracious. After he had done so
much."</p>

<p>"It was a pity the world couldn't do its business without a
Rud&mdash;from the beginning," said Carstall. "I suppose Rud was
necessary, but I cannot see why he was necessary. I suppose these
new biological philosophers now can tell a sort of story about
individuality being a necessary step for realisation and all that
sort of jargon..."</p>

<p>"<i>Individual as Tentative</i>," said Krause, quoting the title
of a current popular book.</p>

<p>"The way he used to call himself <i>The</i> Common Man," said
Carstall. "What did he mean by that really? What was he getting at?
I've never quite got to the bottom of that. A sort of return from
individualism at large, wild individualism, to&mdash;one might call
it&mdash;co-operative identification...<i>Individual as
Tentative</i>, I haven't read that book. But that's the idea.
Perhaps we are all drifting to that. In his own peculiar
self-centred fashion, I suppose he was doing just what you and I
are doing in our work, what religion and morality have always been
doing. That's the line of thought. He was certainly conscious of
being impelled to develop&mdash;not himself exactly, but how can I
say it?&mdash;his particular aspect of that common man who is
hidden in all of us, that unknown common man, that undying,
unhurrying, incessant man in common, who says this through one man
and that through another, and who comprehends and transcends us
all?"</p>

<p>Carstall enunciated his phrases slowly and carefully, with his
hands behind his head and his eyes among the clouds.</p>

<p>"<i>He talks like a book,</i>" thought Krause. "<i>He might be
dictating to his stenographer. That last bit might be in
capitals...And he poisoned the Master Dictator like a
rat!</i>...</p>

<p>"<i>And where</i>," reflected Krause, "<i>would he and I and all
this free and lovely life of ours be to-day if it hadn't been for
the vehemence and vindictiveness of the Holy Terror?</i></p>

<p>"<i>Or&mdash;to be just&mdash;that dose of arsenic? I suppose
that too was necessary...As he said, the rest of us hadn't the
guts...</i></p>

<p>"<i>Hard and cold. Think of it! Living with that lovely wife of
his and never breathing a word even to her...Ten years of silence
for fear she wouldn't understand. Or so as not to make her an
accessory after the fact...As though she'd have told on him!...Or
not to put a strain on her gentle mind...That too I couldn't have
done. It's too much self-control altogether for me...</i>"</p>

<p>Carstall said no more, pursuing his private meditations over his
cigar, and Krause went on thinking.</p>

<p>"<i>Lusts of reptiles, stallion pride, dog hunger, anger of
apes, obstinacy of urgency and obstinate resistances, cunning and
double-crossing&mdash;So it is we got here. It is too much for my
poor understanding,</i>" thought Krause. "<i>It is too much for any
understanding. He talks like a book, and quite apart from that
poisoning, quite apart from that, he and this free and handsome new
world of his make me afraid. Perhaps I should have been a little
afraid in any world. He talks like a book and yet I have to admit
that what he says is harshly true. Mystical Stoicism is as much as
we can make of it...</i></p>

<p>"<i>As much maybe as any of us individually ever will make of
it,</i>" thought Krause. "<i>But could there be this greater sort
of mind, this co-operative mind? How would it work? Couldn't we
somehow know of it? It would be such a mitigation. Isn't it after
all a sort of God?...</i></p>

<p>"Carstall," he said aloud. "That transcendental mind..."</p>

<p>The idea escaped him.</p>

<p>Carstall glanced sideways at him and seemed to understand what
he was unable to say. "So far as we go now," he said, "thinking of
these things is like shouting to catch the ear of a star. When we
are young we think the stars are looking down on us&mdash;entirely
sympathetic. And when we have lived through our personal lives we
come out on the other side&mdash;and find <i>this</i>. The stars in
their courses going away from us. Inexplicably. Like people leaving
a theatre...</p>

<p>"<i>We have been played...</i>"</p>
<br>

<h3>&sect; V</h3>

<p class="first">A few days afterwards Carstall came upon his
youngest son curled up on a grassy slope beneath a bank of purple
iris, reading a Memoir of the Master Director.</p>

<p>He was absorbed in the book. "Gosh!" he exclaimed. Carstall
stood over his son unnoticed.</p>

<p>"What do you think of him, Bunny?"</p>

<p>The boy sat up with a start. He answered after due
consideration.</p>

<p>"Think of him? I think he was a Holy Terror," he said. "Worse
than Napo or Musso or any of them. I suppose you knew him quite
well, Father? Talked to him and all that?"</p>

<p>"Your grandfather brought him into the world and I was his
schoolfellow. We knew a lot about him. Yes. I was called in. I
assisted at his last illness. I suppose it tells you that."</p>

<p>"And it was you made up their minds for them that the Dictator
had done his task and that we did not need another. Good old Daddy!
They say it was his desire. He turned to you at the last."</p>

<p>"It says that? It says he turned to me at the last?..."</p>

<p>"You knew his work was done?"</p>

<p>"Yes..."</p>

<p>"He must have been a Holy Terror to get on with, though, if half
of this is true," said Bunny, after a pause for reflection. "All
the same..."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"He got a move on things..."</p>

<p>Carstall considered that for some moments, Then he expressed the
other side of his own unsolved perplexity. "Maybe," he said, "the
move was there anyhow; maybe it just took him."</p>

<p>But Bunny was five-and-twenty years at least too young for
predestination, Mystical Stoicism and that style of thought. His
father's doubts flew over his head unheeded. "It was marvellous the
way he seemed to get hold of people. I suppose Bodisham had a very
powerful mind; the great world organiser, they call him. And
Bellacourt the Air Master. And Norvel. Re-educating the whole
world! And those others. But they all worked for <i>him</i>. He was
horrid at times; he had people shot and he killed his best friends.
But always they stood by him. Didn't they? It says here 'he cleared
things out of their way'. It says here 'he seemed to make it
possible for them to work unencumbered'. And they seemed in a way
to like him, even when he treated them badly. There must have been
something about him...And he did, it says, he did clean up the
suffocating tangle the world was in'. What a world it was! So
<i>mean</i>. Everybody doing everybody in. Profits, usury,
appropriating things, taxes upon taxes, patenting, monopolising,
sweating, stealing, frauds, gambling...He cleaned it up. I wish I
could have seen him once. I missed him by just two years&mdash;two
years and a month. At least I wasn't born, I mean...I suppose
<i>you</i> did all you could for him?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Carstall slowly. "Yes. I did all I could for him.
According to my lights. I did my best for him&mdash;and his work.
Quite at the last, you know. When he turned to me."</p>

<p>He took the book, flicked over a few pages, mused over it, and
handed it back to his son.</p>

<p>"This book exaggerates here and there&mdash;and it simplifies
things. It simplifies a lot. What else can a book do? I suppose
that makes it easier to read. It brings life within our
compass...Broadly anyhow it is the truth. The condensed truth about
the World Revolution. It is as real as most other historical
stuff..."</p>
