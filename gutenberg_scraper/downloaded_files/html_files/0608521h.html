<p align="center"><font size="+1"><i>Daytime. The Stage of a Theatre</i></font></p>

<hr>
<p class="nhi">N. B. The Comedy is without acts or scenes. The
performance is interrupted once, without the curtain being
lowered, when the manager and the chief characters withdraw to
arrange the scenario. A second interruption of the action takes
place when, by mistake, the stage hands let the curtain down.</p>

<a name="ActI"></a>

<h2>ACT I</h2>

<p class="nhi">The spectators will find the curtain raised and
the stage as it usually is during the day time. It will be half
dark, and empty, so that from the beginning the public may have
the impression of an impromptu performance. Prompter's box and a
small table and chair for the manager.</p>

<p class="nhi">Two other small tables and several chairs
scattered about as during rehearsals.</p>

<p class="nh"><i>The</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font> and <font
size="-1">ACTRESSES</font> <i>of the company enter from the back
of the stage: first one, then another, then two together; nine or
ten in all. They are about to rehearse a Pirandello play:</i>
Mixing it Up. [Il giuoco delle parti.] <i>Some of the company
move off towards their dressing rooms. The</i> <font size=
"-1">PROMPTER</font> <i>who has the "book" under his arm, is
waiting for the manager in order to begin the rehearsal.</i></p>

<p class="nh"><i>The</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font> and <font
size="-1">ACTRESSES</font>, <i>some standing, some sitting, chat
and smoke. One perhaps reads a paper; another cons his
part.</i></p>

<p class="nh"><i>Finally, the</i> <font size="-1">MANAGER</font>
<i>enters and goes to the table prepared for him. His</i> <font
size="-1">SECRETARY</font> <i>brings him his mail, through which
he glances. The</i> <font size="-1">PROMPTER</font> <i>takes his
seat, turns on a light, and opens the "book."</i></p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>throwing a letter down on the
table</i>]. I can't see [<i>To</i> <font size="-1">PROPERTY
MAN</font>.] Let's have a little light, please!</p>

<p><b>Property Man.</b> Yes sir, yes, at once. [<i>A light comes
down on to the stage.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>clapping his hands</i>]. Come along!
Come along! Second act of "Mixing It Up." [<i>Sits down.</i>]
[<i>The</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font> and <font size=
"-1">ACTRESSES</font> <i>go from the front of the stage to the
wings, all except the three who are to begin the
rehearsal.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Prompter</b> [<i>reading the "book"</i>]. "Leo Gala's
house. A curious room serving as dining-room and study."</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>to</i> <font size="-1">PROPERTY
MAN</font>]. Fix up the old red room.</p>

<p><b>Property Man</b> [<i>noting it down</i>]. Red set. All
right!</p>

<p><b>The Prompter</b> [<i>continuing to read from the
"book"</i>]. "Table already laid and writing desk with books and
papers. Book-shelves. Exit rear to Leo's bedroom. Exit left to
kitchen. Principal exit to right."</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>energetically</i>]. Well, you
understand: The principal exit over there; here, the kitchen.
[<i>Turning to actor who is to play the part of</i> SOCRATES.]
You make your entrances and exits here. [<i>To</i> <font size=
"-1">PROPERTY MAN</font>.] The baize doors at the rear, and
curtains.</p>

<p><b>Property Man</b> [<i>noting it down</i>]. Right!</p>

<p><b>Prompter</b> [<i>reading as before</i>]. "When the curtain
rises, Leo Gala, dressed in cook's cap and apron is busy beating
an egg in a cup. Philip, also dresesd as a cook, is beating
another egg. Guido Venanzi is seated and listening."</p>

<p><b>Leading Man</b> [<i>To</i> <font size="-1">MANAGER</font>].
Excuse me, but must I absolutely wear a cook's cap?</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>annoyed</i>]. I imagine so. It says so
there anyway. [<i>Pointing to the "book."</i>]</p>

<p><b>Leading Man</b>. But it's ridiculous!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>jumping up in a rage</i>]. Ridiculous?
Ridiculous? Is it my fault if France won't send us any snore good
comedies, and we are reduced to putting on Pirandello's works,
where nobody understands anything, and where the author plays the
fool with us all? [<i>The</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font>
<i>grin. The</i> <font size="-1">MANAGER</font> <i>goes to</i>
<font size="-1">LEADING MAN</font> <i>and shouts.</i>] Yes sir,
you put on the cook's cap and beat eggs. Do you suppose that with
all this egg-beating business you are on an ordinary stage? Get
that out of your head. You represent the shell of the eggs you
are beating! [<i>Laughter and comments among the</i> <font size=
"-1">ACTORS</font>.] Silence! and listen to my explanations,
please! [<i>To</i> <font size="-1">LEADING MAN</font>.] "The
empty form of reason without the fullness of instinct, which is
blind." -- You stand for reason, your wife is instinct. It's a
mixing up of the parts, according to which you who act your own
part become the puppet of yourself. Do you understand?</p>

<p><b>Leading Man</b>. I'm hanged if I do.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Neither do I. But let's get on with it.
It's sure to be a glorious failure anyway.
[<i>Confidentially.</i>] But I say, please face three-quarters.
Otherwise, what with the abstruseness of the dialogue, and the
public that won't be able to hear you, the whole thing will go to
hell. Come on! come on!</p>

<p><b>Prompter.</b> Pardon sir, may I get into my box? There's a
bit of a draught.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Yes, yes, of course!</p>

<p class="nh"><i>At this point, the</i> <font size=
"-1">DOOR-KEEPER</font> <i>has entered from the stage door and
advances towards the manager's table, taking off his braided cap.
During this manoeuvre, the Six</i> <font size=
"-1">CHARACTERS</font> <i>enter, and stop by the door at back of
stage, so that when the</i> <font size="-1">DOOR-KEEPER</font>
<i>is about to announce their coming to the</i> <font size=
"-1">MANAGER</font>, <i>they are already on the stage. A tenuous
light surrounds them, almost as if irradiated by them -- the
faint breath of their fantastic reality.</i></p>

<p class="nhi">This light will disappear when they come forward
towards the actors. They preserve, however, something of the
dream lightness in which they seem almost suspended; but this
does not detract from the essential reality of their forms and
expressions.</p>

<p class="nh"><i>He who is known as</i> <font size="-1">THE
FATHER</font> <i>is a man of about 50: hair, reddish in colour,
thin at the temples; he is not bald, however; thick moustaches,
falling over his still fresh mouth, which often opens in an empty
and uncertain smile. He is fattish, pale; with an especially wide
forehead. He has blue, oval-shaped eyes, very clear and piercing.
Wears light trousers and a dark jacket. He is alternatively
mellifluous and violent in his manner.</i></p>

<p class="nh"><font size="-1">THE MOTHER</font> <i>seems crushed
and terrified as if by an intolerable weight of shame and
abasement. She is dressed in modest black and wears a thick
widow's veil of cr&ecirc;pe. When she lifts this, she reveals a
wax-like face. She always keeps her eyes downcast.</i></p>

<p class="nh"><font size="-1">THE STEP-DAUGHTER</font>, <i>is
dashing, almost impudent, beautiful. She wears mourning too, but
with great elegance. She shows contempt for the timid
half-frightened manner of the wretched</i> <font size=
"-1">BOY</font> <i>(14 years old, and also dressed in black); on
the other hand, she displays a lively tenderness for her little
sister,</i> <font size="-1">THE CHILD</font> <i>(about four), who
is dressed in white, with a black silk sash at the waist.</i></p>

<p class="nh"><font size="-1">THE SON</font> (22) <i>tall, severe
in his attitude of contempt for</i> <font size="-1">THE
FATHER</font>, <i>supercilious and indifferent to</i> <font size=
"-1">THE MOTHER.</font> <i>He looks as if he had come on the
stage against his will.</i></p>

<p><b>Door-keeper</b> [<i>cap in hand</i>]. Excuse me, sir...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>rudely</i>]. Eh? What is it?</p>

<p><b>Door-keeper</b> [<i>timidly</i>]. These people are asking
for you, sir.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>furious</i>]. I am rehearsing, and you
know perfectly well no one's allowed to come in during
rehearsals! [<i>Turning to the</i> <font size=
"-1">CHARACTERS</font>.] Who are you, please? What do you
want?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>coming forward a little, followed by the
others who seem embarrassed</i>]. As a matter of fact... we have
come here in search of an author...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>half angry, half amazed</i>]. An
author? What author?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Any author, sir.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. But there's no author here. We are not
rehearsing a new piece.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>vivaciously</i>]. So much the
better, so much the better! We can be your new piece.</p>

<p><b>An Actor</b> [<i>coming forward from the others</i>]. Oh,
do you hear that?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>to</i> <font size=
"-1">STEP-DAUGHTER</font>]. Yes, but if the author isn't
here...[<i>To</i> <font size="-1">MANAGER</font>.] unless you
would be willing...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. You are trying to be funny.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. No, for Heaven's sake, what are you saying?
We bring you a drama, sir.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. We may be your fortune.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Will you oblige me by going away? We
haven't time to waste with mad people.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>mellifluously</i>]. Oh sir, you know
well that life is full of infinite absurdities, which, strangely
enough, do not even need to appear plausible, since they are
true.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. What the devil is he talking about?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. I say that to reverse the ordinary process
may well be considered a madness: that is, to create credible
situations, in order that they may appear true. But permit me to
observe that if this be madness, it is the sole <i>raison
d'&ecirc;tre</i> of your profession, gentlemen. [<i>The</i> <font
size="-1">ACTORS</font> <i>look hurt and perplexed.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>getting up and looking at him</i>]. So
our profession seems to you one worthy of madmen then?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Well, to make seem true that which isn't
true...without any need...for a joke as it were ...Isn't that
your mission, gentlemen: to give life to fantastic characters on
the stage?</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>interpreting the rising anger of
the</i> <font size="-1">COMPANY</font>]. But I would beg you to
believe, my dear sir, that the profession of the comedian is a
noble one. If today, as things go, the playwrights give us stupid
comedies to play and puppets to represent instead of men,
remember we are proud to have given life to immortal works here
on these very boards! [<i>The</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font>,
<i>satisfied, applaud their</i> <font size=
"-1">MANAGER</font>.]</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>interrupting furiously</i>]. Exactly,
perfectly, to living beings more alive than those who breathe and
wear clothes: beings less real perhaps, but truer! I agree with
you entirely. [<i>The</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font> <i>look
at one another in amazement.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. But what do you mean? Before, you
said...</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. No, excuse me, I meant it for you, sir, who
were crying out that you had no time to lose with madmen, while
no one better than yourself knows that nature uses the instrument
of human fantasy in order to pursue her high creative
purpose.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Very well, -- but where does all this take
us?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Nowhere! It is merely to show you that one
is born to life in many forms, in many shapes, as tree, or as
stone, as water, as butterfly, or as woman. So one may also be
born a character in a play.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>with feigned comic dismay</i>]. So you
and these other friends of yours have been born characters?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Exactly, and alive as you see! [<font size=
"-1">MANAGER</font> <i>and</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font>
<i>burst out laughing.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>hurt</i>]. I am sorry you laugh, because
we carry in us a drama, as you can guess from this woman here
veiled in black.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>losing patience at last and almost
indignant</i>]. Oh, chuck it! Get away please! Clear out of here!
[<i>To</i> <font size="-1">PROPERTY MAN</font>.] For Heaven's
sake, turn them out!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>resisting</i>]. No, no, look here,
we...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>roaring</i>]. We come here to work, you
know.</p>

<p><b>Leading Actor</b>. One cannot let oneself be made such a
fool of.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>determined, coming forward</i>]. I
marvel at your incredulity, gentlemen. Are you not accustomed to
see the characters created by an author spring to life in
yourselves and face each other? Just because there is no "book"
[<i>Pointing to the</i> <font size="-1">PROMPTER</font>'S
<i>box.</i>] which contains us, you refuse to believe...</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>advances towards</i> <font size=
"-1">MANAGER</font>, <i>smiling and coquettish</i>]. Believe me,
we are really six most interesting characters, sir; side-tracked
however.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Yes, that is the word! [<i>To</i> <font
size="-1">MANAGER</font> <i>all at once.</i>] In the sense, that
is, that the author who created us alive no longer wished, or was
no longer able, materially to put us into a work of art. And this
was a real crime, sir; because he who has had the luck to be born
a character can laugh even at death. He cannot die. The man, the
writer, the instrument of the creation will die, but his creation
does not die. And to live for ever, it does not need to have
extraordinary gifts or to be able to work wonders. Who was Sancho
Panza? Who was Don Abbondio? Yet they live eternally because --
live germs as they were -- they had the fortune to find a
fecundating matrix, a fantasy which could raise and nourish them:
make them live for ever!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. That is quite all right. But what do you
want here, all of you?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. We want to live.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>ironically</i>]. For Eternity?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. No, sir, only for a moment...in you.</p>

<p><b>An Actor</b>. Just listen to him!</p>

<p><b>Leading Lady.</b> They want to live, in us...</p>

<p><b>Juvenile Lead</b> [<i>pointing to the</i> <font size=
"-1">STEP-DAUGHTER</font>]. I've no objection, as far as that one
is concerned!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Look here! look here! The comedy has to be
made. [<i>To the</i> <font size="-1">MANAGER</font>.] But if you
and your actors are willing, we can soon concert it among
ourselves.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>annoyed</i>]. But what do you want to
concert? We don't go in for concerts here. Here we play dramas
and comedies!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Exactly! That is just why we have come to
you.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. And where is the "book"?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. It is in us! [<i>The</i> <font size=
"-1">ACTORS</font> <i>laugh.</i>] The drama is in us, and we are
the drama. We are impatient to play it. Our inner passion drives
us on to this.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>disdainful, alluring,
treacherous, full of impudence</i>]. My passion, sir! Ah, if you
only knew! My passion for him! [<i>Points to the</i> <font size=
"-1">FATHER</font> <i>and makes a pretence of embracing him. Then
she breaks out into a loud laugh.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>angrily</i>]. Behave yourself! And
please don't laugh in that fashion.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. With your permission, gentlemen, I,
who am a two months' orphan, will show you how I can dance and
sing. [<i>Sings and then dances</i> Prenez garde &agrave;
Tchou-Tchin-Tchou.]</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="s">Les chinois sont un peuple malin,<br>
De Shangal &agrave; Pekin,<br>
Ils ont mis des &eacute;criteaux partout:<br>
Prenez garde &agrave; Tchou-Tchin-Tchou.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Actors and Actresses</b>. Bravo! Well done! Tip-top!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Silence! This isn't a caf&eacute; concert,
you know! [<i>Turning to the</i> <font size="-1">FATHER</font>
<i>in consternation.</i>] Is she mad?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Mad? No, she's worse than mad.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>to</i> <font size=
"-1">MANAGER</font>]. Worse? Worse? Listen! Stage this drama for
us at once! Then you will see that at a certain moment I...when
this little darling here .. [<i>Takes the</i> <font size=
"-1">CHILD</font> <i>by the hand and leads her to the</i> <font
size="-1">MANAGER</font>.] Isn't she a dear? [<i>Takes her up and
kisses her.</i>] Darling! Darling! [<i>Puts her down again and
adds feelingly.</i>] Well, when God suddenly takes this dear
little child away from that poor mother there; and this imbecile
here [<i>Seizing hold of the</i> <font size="-1">BOY</font>
<i>roughly and pushing him forward.</i>] does the stupidest
things, like the fool he is, you will see me run away. Yes,
gentlemen, I shall be off. But the moment hasn't arrived yet.
After what has taken place between him and me [<i>indicates
the</i> <font size="-1">FATHER</font> <i>with a horrible
wink.</i>] I can't remain any longer in this society, to have to
witness the anguish of this mother here for that
fool...[<i>Indicates the</i> <font size="-1">SON.</font>] Look at
him! Look at him! See how indifferent, how frigid he is, because
he is the legitimate son. He despises me, despises him
[<i>Pointing to the</i> <font size="-1">BOY.</font>], despises
this baby here; because...we are bastards. [<i>Goes to the</i>
<font size="-1">MOTHER</font> <i>and embraces her.</i>] And he
doesn't want to recognize her as his mother -- she who is the
common mother of us all. He looks down upon her as if she were
only the mother of us three bastards. Wretch! [<i>She says all
this very rapidly, excitedly. At the word "bastards" she raises
her voice, and almost spits out the final "Wretch!"</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b> [<i>to the</i> <font size=
"-1">MANAGER</font>, <i>in anguish</i>]. In the name of these two
little children, I beg you...[<i>She grows faint and is about to
fall.</i>] Oh God!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>coming forward to support her as do some
of the</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font>]. Quick, a chair, a
chair for this poor widow!</p>

<p><b>The Actors.</b> Is it true? Has she really fainted?</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Quick, a chair! Here! [<i>One of the</i>
<font size="-1">ACTORS</font> <i>brings a chair, the</i> <font
size="-1">OTHERS</font> <i>proffer assistance. The</i> <font
size="-1">MOTHER</font> <i>tries to prevent the</i> <font size=
"-1">FATHER</font> <i>from lifting the veil which covers her
face.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Look at her! Look at her!</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. No, no; stop it please!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>raising her veil</i>]. Let them see
you!</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b> [<i>rising and covering her face with her
hands, in desperation</i>]. I beg you, sir, to prevent this man
from carrying out his plan which is loathsorn.e to me.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>dumbfounded</i>]. I don't understand at
all. What is the situation? Is this lady your wife? [<i>To
the</i> <font size="-1">FATHER.</font>]</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Yes, gentlemen: my wife!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. But how can she be a widow if you are
alive? [<i>The</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font> <i>find relief
for their astonishment in a loud laugh.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Don't laugh! Don't laugh like that, for
Heaven's sake. Her drama lies just here in this: she has had a
lover, a man who ought to be here.</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b> [<i>with a cry</i>]. No! No!</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Fortunately for her, he is dead. Two
months ago as I said. We are in mourning, as you see.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. He isn't here you see, not because he is
dead. He isn't here -- look at her a moment and you will
understand -- because her drama isn't a drama of the love of two
men for whom she was incapable of feeling anything except
possibly a little gratitude -- gratitude not for me but for the
other. She isn't a woman, she is a mother, and her drama --
powerful sir, I assure you -- lies, as a matter of fact, all in
these four children she has had by two men.</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. I had them? Have you got the courage to say
that I wanted them? [<i>To the</i> <font size=
"-1">COMPANY.</font>] It was his doing. It was he who gave me
that other man, who forced me to go away with him.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. It isn't true.</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b> [<i>startled</i>]. Not true, isn't it?</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. No, it isn't true, it just isn't
true.</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. And what can you know about it?</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. It isn't true. Don't believe it.
[<i>To</i> <font size="-1">MANAGER</font>.] Do you know why she
says so? For that fellow there. [<i>Indicates the</i> <font size=
"-1">SON.</font>] She tortures herself, destroys herself on
account of the neglect of that son there; and she wants him to
believe that if she abandoned him when he was only two years old,
it was because he [<i>Indicates the</i> <font size=
"-1">FATHER.</font>] made her do so.</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b> [<i>vigorously</i>]. He forced me to it, and
I call God to witness it. [<i>To the</i> <font size=
"-1">MANAGER</font>.] Ask him [<i>Indicates</i> <font size=
"-1">HUSBAND.</font>] if it isn't true. Let him speak. You
[<i>To</i> <font size="-1">DAUGHTER.</font>] are not in a
position to know anything about it.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. I know you lived in peace and
happiness with my father while he lived. Can you deny it?</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. No, I don't deny it...</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. He was always full of affection and
kindness for you. [<i>To the</i> <font size="-1">BOY,</font>
<i>angrily.</i>] It's true, isn't it? Tell them! Why don't you
speak, you little fool?</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. Leave the poor boy alone. Why do you want
to make me appear ungrateful, daughter? I don't want to offend
your father. I have answered him that I didn't abandon my house
and my son through any fault of mine, nor from any wilful
passion.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. It is true. It was my doing.</p>

<p><b>Leading Man</b> [<i>to the</i> <font size=
"-1">COMPANY</font>]. What a spectacle!</p>

<p><b>Leading Lady.</b> We are the audience this time.</p>

<p><b>Juvenile Lead</b>. For once, in a way.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>beginning to get really
interested</i>]. Let's hear them out. Listen!</p>

<p><b>The Son</b>. Oh yes, you're going to hear a fine bit now.
He will talk to you of the Demon of Experiment.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. You are a cynical imbecile. I've told you
so already a hundred times. [<i>To the</i> <font size=
"-1">MANAGER</font>.] He tries to make fun of me on account of
this expression which I have found to excuse myself with.</p>

<p><b>The Son</b> [<i>with disgust</i>]. Yes, phrases!
phrases!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Phrases! Isn't everyone consoled when faced
with a trouble or fact he doesn't understand, by a word, some
simple word, which tells us nothing and yet calms us?</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Even in the case of remorse. In
fact, especially then.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Remorse? No, that isn't true. I've done
more than use words to quieten the remorse in me.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Yes, there was a bit of money too.
Yes, yes, a bit of money. There were the hundred lire he was
about to offer me in payment, gentlemen... [<i>Sensation of
horror among the</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font>.]</p>

<p><b>The Son</b> [<i>to the</i> <font size=
"-1">STEP-DAUGHTER</font>]. This is vile.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Vile? There they were in a pale blue
envelope on a little mahogany table in the back of Madame Pace's
shop. You know Madame Pace -- one of those ladies who attract
poor girls of good family into their ateliers, under the pretext
of their selling <i>robes et manteaux.</i></p>

<p><b>The Son</b>. And he thinks he has bought the right to
tyrannize over us all with those hundred lire he was going to
pay; but which, fortunately -- note this, gentlemen -- he had no
chance of paying.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. It was a near thing, though, you
know! [<i>Laughs ironically.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b> [<i>protesting</i>]. Shame, my daughter,
shame!</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Shame indeed! This is my revenge! I
am dying to live that scene...The room... I see it...Here is the
window with the mantles exposed, there the divan, the
looking-glass, a screen, there in front of the window the little
mahogany table with the blue envelope containing one hundred
lire. I see it. I see it. I could take hold of it...But you,
gentlemen, you ought to turn your backs now: I am almost nude,
you know. But I don't blush: I leave that to him.
[<i>Indicating</i> <font size="-1">FATHER.</font>]</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. I don't understand this at all.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Naturally enough. I would ask you, sir. to
exercise your authority a little here, and let me speak before
you believe all she is trying to blame me with. Let me
explain.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Ah yes, explain it in your own
way.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. But don't you see that the whole trouble
lies here. In words, words. Each one of us has within him a whole
world of things, each man of us his own special world. And how
can we ever come to an understanding if I put in the words I
utter the sense and value of things as I see them; while you who
listen to me must inevitably translate them according to the
conception of things each one of you has within himself. We think
we understand each other, but we never really do. Look here! This
woman [<i>Indicating the</i> <font size="-1">MOTHER.</font>]
takes all my pity for her as a specially ferocious form of
cruelty.</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. But you drove me away.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Do you hear her? I drove her away! She
believes I really sent her away.</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. You know how to talk, and I don't; but,
believe me, sir [<i>To</i> <font size="-1">MANAGER</font>.],
after he had married me...who knows why?...I was a poor
insignificant woman...</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. But, good Heavens! it was just for your
humility that I married you. I loved this simplicity in you.
[<i>He stops when he sees she makes signs to contradict him,
opens his arms wide in sign of desperation, seeing how hopeless
it is to make himself understood.</i>] You see she denies it. Her
mental deafness, believe me, is phenomenal, the limit:
[<i>Touches his forehead.</i>] deaf, deaf, mentally deaf! She has
plenty of feeling. Oh yes, a good heart for the children; but the
brain -- deaf, to the point of desperation</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Yes, but ask him how his
intelligence has helped us.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. If we could see all the evil that may
spring from good, what should we do? [<i>At this point the</i>
<font size="-1">LEADING LADY</font> <i>who is biting her lips
with rage at seeing the</i> <font size="-1">LEADING MAN</font>
<i>flirting with the</i> <font size="-1">STEP-DAUGHTER,</font>
<i>comes forward and says to the</i> <font size=
"-1">MANAGER</font>.]</p>

<p><b>Leading Lady.</b> Excuse me, but are we going to rehearse
today?</p>

<p><b>Manager</b>. Of course, of course; but let's hear them
out.</p>

<p><b>Juvenile Lead</b>. This is something quite new.</p>

<p><b>L'Ing&eacute;nue.</b> Most interesting!</p>

<p><b>Leading Lady.</b> Yes, for the people who like that kind of
thing. [<i>Casts a glance at</i> <font size="-1">LEADING
MAN</font>.]</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>to</i> <font size="-1">FATHER</font>].
You must please explain yourself quite clearly. [<i>Sits
down.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Very well then: listen! I had in my service
a poor man, a clerk, a secretary of mine, full of devotion, who
became friends with her. [<i>Indicating the</i> <font size=
"-1">MOTHER.</font>] They understood one another, were kindred
souls in fact, without, however, the least suspicion of any evil
existing. They were incapable even of thinking of it.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. So he thought of it -- for them!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. That's not true. I meant to do good to them
-- and to myself, I confess, at the same time. Things had come to
the point that I could not say a word to either of them without
their making a mute appeal, one to the other, with their eyes. I
could see them silently asking each other how I was to be kept in
countenance, how I was to be kept quiet. And this, believe me,
was just about enough of itself to keep me in a constant rage, to
exasperate me beyond measure.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. And why didn't you send him away then --
this secretary of yours?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Precisely what I did, sir. And then I had
to watch this poor woman drifting forlornly about the house like
an animal without a master, like an animal one has taken in out
of pity.</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. Ah yes...</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>suddenly turning to the</i> <font size=
"-1">MOTHER</font>]. It's true about the son anyway, isn't
it?</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. He took my son away from me first of
all.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. But not from cruelty. I did it so that he
should grow up healthy and strong by living in the country.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>pointing to him ironically</i>].
As one can see.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>quickly</i>]. Is it my fault if he has
grown up like this? I sent him to a wet nurse in the country, a
peasant, as she did not seem to me strong enough, though she is
of humble origin. That was, anyway, the reason I married her.
Unpleasant all this may be, but how can it be helped? My mistake
possibly, but there we are! All my life I have had these
confounded aspirations towards a certain moral sanity. [<i>At
this point the</i> <font size="-1">STEP-DAUGHTER</font> <i>bursts
into a noisy laugh.</i>] Oh, stop it! Stop it! I can't stand
it.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Yes, please stop it, for Heaven's
sake.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. But imagine moral sanity from him,
if you please -- the client of certain ateliers like that of
Madame Pace!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Fool! That is the proof that I am a man!
This seeming contradiction, gentlemen, is the strongest proof
that I stand here a live man before you. Why, it is just for this
very incongruity in my nature that I have had to suffer what I
have. I could not live by the side of that woman [<i>Indicating
the</i> <font size="-1">MOTHER.</font>] any longer; but not so
much for the boredom she inspired me with as for the pity I felt
for her.</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. And so he turned me out -- -.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. -- well provided for! Yes, I sent her to
that man, gentlemen...to let her go free of me.</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. And to free himself.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Yes, I admit it. It was also a liberation
for me. But great evil has come of it. I meant well when I did
it; and I did it more for her sake than mine. I swear it.
[<i>Crosses his arms on his chest; then turns suddenly to the</i>
<font size="-1">MOTHER.</font>] Did I ever lose sight of you
until that other man carried you off to another town, like the
angry fool he was? And on account of my pure interest in you...
my pure interest, I repeat, that had no base motive in it...I
watched with the tenderest concern the new family that grew up
around her. She can bear witness to this. [<i>Points to the</i>
<font size="-1">STEP-DAUGHTER.</font>]</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Oh yes, that's true enough. When I
was a kiddie, so so high, you know, with plaits over my shoulders
and knickers longer than my skirts, I used to see him waiting
outside the school for me to come out. He came to see how I was
growing up.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. This is infamous, shameful!</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. No. Why?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Infamous! infamous! [<i>Then excitedly
to</i> <font size="-1">MANAGER</font> <i>explaining.</i>] After
she [<i>Indicating</i> <font size="-1">MOTHER.</font>] went away,
my house seemed suddenly empty. She was my incubus, but she
filled my house. I was like a dazed fly alone in the empty rooms.
This boy here [<i>Indicating the</i> <font size="-1">SON.</font>]
was educated away from home, and when he came back, he seemed to
me to be no more mine. With no mother to stand between him and
me, he grew up entirely for himself, on his own, apart, with no
tie of intellect or affection binding him to me. And then --
strange but true -- I was driven, by curiosity at first and then
by some tender sentiment, towards her family, which had come into
being through my will. The thought of her began gradually to fill
up the emptiness I felt all around me. I wanted to know if she
were happy in living out the simple daily duties of life. I
wanted to think of her as fortunate and happy because far away
from the complicated torments of my spirit. And so, to have proof
of this, I used to watch that child coming out of school.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Yes, yes. True. He used to follow me
in the street and smiled at me, waved his hand, like this. I
would look at him with interest, wondering who he might be. I
told my mother, who guessed at once. [<i>The</i> <font size=
"-1">MOTHER</font> <i>agrees with a nod.</i>] Then she didn't
want to send me to school for some days; and when I finally went
back, there he was again -- looking so ridiculous -- with a paper
parcel in his hands. He came close to me, caressed me, and drew
out a fine straw hat from the parcel, with a bouquet of flowers
-- all for me!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. A bit discursive this, you know!</p>

<p><b>The Son</b> [<i>contemptuously</i>]. Literature!
Literature!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Literature indeed! This is life, this is
passion!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. It may be, but it won't act.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. I agree. This is only the part leading up.
I don't suggest this should be staged. She [<i>Pointing to
the</i> <font size="-1">STEP-DAUGHTER.</font>], as you see, is no
longer the flapper with plaits down her back -- .</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. -- and the knickers showing below
the skirt!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. The drama is coming now, sir; something
new, complex, most interesting.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. As soon as my father died...</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. -- there was absolute misery for them. They
came back here, unknown to me. Through her stupidity!
[<i>Pointing to the</i> <font size="-1">MOTHER.</font>] It is
true she can barely write her own name; but she could anyhow have
got her daughter to write to me that they were in need...</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. And how was I to divine all this sentiment
in him? The Father. That is exactly your mistake, never to have
guessed any of my sentiments.</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. After so many years apart, and all that had
happened...</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Was it my fault if that fellow carried you
away? It happened quite suddenly; for after he had obtained some
job or other, I could find no trace of them; and so, not
unnaturally, my interest in them dwindled. But the drama
culminated unforeseen and violent on their return, when I was
impelled by my miserable flesh that still lives...Ah! what
misery, what wretchedness is that of the man who is alone and
disdains debasing liaisons! Not old enough to do without women,
and not young enough to go and look for one without shame.
Misery? It's worse than misery; it's a horror; for no woman can
any longer give him love; and when a man feels this...One ought
to do without, you say? Yes, yes. I know. Each of us when he
appears before his fellows is clothed in a certain dignity. But
every man knows what unconfessable things pass within the secrecy
of his own heart. One gives way to the temptation, only to rise
from it again, afterwards, with a great eagerness to re-establish
one's dignity, as if it were a tombstone to place on the grave of
one's shame, and a monument to hide and sign the memory of our
weaknesses. Everybody's in the same case. Some folks haven't the
courage to say certain things, that's all!</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. All appear to have the courage to do
them though.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Yes, but in secret. Therefore, you want
more courage to say these things. Let a man but speak these
things out, and folks at once label him a cynic. But it isn't
true. He is like all the others, better indeed, because he isn't
afraid to reveal with the light of the intelligence the red shame
of human bestiality on which most men close their eyes so as not
to see it. Woman -- for example, look at her case! She turns
tantalizing inviting glances on you. You seize her. No sooner
does she feel herself in your grasp than she closes her eyes. It
is the sign of her mission, the sign by which she says to man:
"Blind yourself, for I am blind."</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Sometimes she can close them no
more: when she no longer feels the need of hiding her shame to
herself, but dry-eyed and dispassionately, sees only that of the
man who has blinded himself without love. Oh, all these
intellectual complications make me sick, disgust me -- all this
philosophy that uncovers the beast in man, and then seeks to save
him, excuse him... I can't stand it, sir. When a man seeks to
"simplify" life bestially, throwing aside every relic of
humanity, every chaste aspiration, every pure feeling, all sense
of ideality, duty, modesty, shame...then nothing is more
revolting and nauseous than a certain kind of remorse --
crocodiles' tears, that's what it is.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Let's come to the point. This is only
discussion.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Very good, sir! But a fact is like a sack
which won't stand up when it is empty. In order that it may stand
up, one has to put into it the reason and sentiment which have
caused it to exist. I couldn't possibly know that after the death
of that man, they had decided to return here, that they were in
misery, and that she [<i>Pointing to the</i> <font size=
"-1">MOTHER.</font>] had gone to work as a modiste, and at a shop
of the type of that of Madame Pace.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. A real high-class modiste, you must
know, gentlemen. In appearance, she works for the leaders of the
best society; but she arranges matters so that these elegant
ladies serve her purpose...without prejudice to other ladies who
are...well...only so so.</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. You will believe me, gentlemen, that it
never entered my mind that the old hag offered me work because
she had her eye on my daughter.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Poor mamma! Do you know, sir, what
that woman did when I brought her back the work my mother had
finished? She would point out to me that I had torn one of my
frocks, and she would give it back to my mother to mend. It was I
who paid for it, always I; while this poor creature here believed
she was sacrificing herself for me and these two children here,
sitting up at night sewing Madame Pace's robes.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. And one day you met there...</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Him, him. Yes sir, an old client.
There's a scene for you to play! Superb!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. She, the Mother arrived just then...</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>treacherously</i>]. Almost in
time!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>crying out</i>]. No, in time! in time!
Fortunately I recognized her...in time. And I took them back home
with me to my house. You can imagine now her position and mine;
she, as you see her; and I who cannot look her in the face.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Absurd! How can I possibly be
expected -- after that -- to be a modest young miss, a fit person
to go with his confounded aspirations for "a solid moral
sanity"?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. For the drama lies all in this -- in the
conscience that I have, that each one of us has. We believe this
conscience to be a single thing, but it is many-sided. There is
one for this person, and another for that. Diverse consciences.
So we have this illusion of being one person for all, of having a
personality that is unique in all our acts. But it isn't true. We
perceive this when, tragically perhaps, in something we do, we
are as it were, suspended, caught up in the air on a kind of
hook. Then we perceive that all of us was not in that act, and
that it would be an atrocious injustice to judge us by that
action alone, as if all our existence were summed up in that one
deed. Now do you understand the perfidy of this girl? She
surprised me in a place, where she ought not to have known me,
just as I could not exist for her; and she now seeks to attach to
me a reality such as I could never suppose I should have to
assume for her in a shameful and fleeting moment of my life. I
feel this above all else. And the drama, you will see, acquires a
tremendous value from this point. Then there is the position of
the others...his...[<i>Indicating the</i> <font size=
"-1">SON.</font>]</p>

<p><b>The Son</b> [<i>shrugging his shoulders scorn fully</i>].
Leave me alone! I don't come into this.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. What? You don't come into this?</p>

<p><b>The Son</b>. I've got nothing to do with it, and don't want
to have; because you know well enough I wasn't made to be mixed
up in all this with the rest of you.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. We are only vulgar folk! He is the
fine gentleman. You may have noticed, Mr. Manager, that I fix him
now and again with a look of scorn while he lowers his eyes --
for he knows the evil he has done me.</p>

<p><b>The Son</b> [<i>scarcely looking at her</i>]. I?</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. You! you! I owe my life on the
streets to you. Did you or did you not deny us, with your
behaviour, I won't say the intimacy of home, but even that mere
hospitality which makes guests feel at their ease? We were
intruders who had come to disturb the kingdom of your legitimacy.
I should like to have you witness, Mr. Manager, certain scenes
between him and me. He says I have tyrannized over everyone. But
it was just his behaviour which made me insist on the reason for
which I had come into the house, -- this reason he calls "vile"
-- into his house, with my mother who is his mother too. And I
came as mistress of the house.</p>

<p><b>The Son</b>. It's easy for them to put me always in the
wrong. But imagine, gentlemen, the position of a son, whose fate
it is to see arrive one day at his home a young woman of impudent
bearing, a young woman who inquires for his father, with whom who
knows what business she has. This young man has then to witness
her return bolder than ever, accompanied by that child there. He
is obliged to watch her treat his father in an equivocal and
confidential manner. She asks money of him in a way that lets one
suppose he must give it her, must, do you understand, because he
has every obligation to do so.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. But I have, as a matter of fact, this
obligation. I owe it to your mother.</p>

<p><b>The Son</b>. How should I know? When had I ever seen or
heard of her? One day there arrive with her [<i>Indicating</i>
<font size="-1">STEP-DAUGHTER.</font>] that lad and this baby
here. I am told: "This is your mother too, you know." I divine
from her manner [<i>Indicating</i> <font size=
"-1">STEP-DAUGHTER</font> <i>again.</i>] why it is they have come
home. I had rather not say what I feel and think about it. I
shouldn't even care to confess to myself. No action can therefore
be hoped for from me in this affair. Believe me, Mr. Manager, I
am an "unrealized" character, dramatically speaking; and I find
myself not at all at ease in their company. Leave me out of it, I
beg you.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. What? It is just because you are so
that...</p>

<p><b>The Son</b>. How do you know what I am like? When did you
ever bother your head about me?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. I admit it. I admit it. But isn't that a
situation in itself? This aloofness of yours which is so cruel to
me and to your mother, who returns home and sees you almost for
the first time grown up, who doesn't recognize you but knows you
are her son...[<i>Pointing out the</i> <font size=
"-1">MOTHER</font> <i>to the</i> <font size="-1">MANAGER</font>.]
See, she's crying!</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>angrily, stamping her foot</i>].
Like a fool!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>indicating</i> <font size=
"-1">STEP-DAUGHTER</font>]. She can't stand him you know.
[<i>Then referring again to the</i> <font size="-1">SON.</font>]
He says he doesn't come into the affair, whereas he is really the
hinge of the whole action. Look at that lad who is always
clinging to his mother, frightened and humiliated. It is on
account of this fellow here. Possibly his situation is the most
painful of all. He feels himself a stranger more than the others.
The poor little chap feels mortified, humiliated at being brought
into a home out of charity as it were. [<i>In confidence.</i>] He
is the image of his father. Hardly talks at all. Humble and
quiet.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Oh, we'll cut him out. You've no notion
what a nuisance boys are on the stage...</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. He disappears soon, you know. And the baby
too. She is the first to vanish from the scene. The drama
consists finally in this: when that mother re-enters my house,
her family born outside of it, and shall we say superimposed on
the original, ends with the death of the little girl, the tragedy
of the boy and the flight of the elder daughter. It cannot go on,
because it is foreign to its surroundings. So after much torment,
we three remain: I, the mother, that son. Then, owing to the
disappearance of that extraneous family, we too find ourselves
strange to one another. We find we are living in an atmosphere of
mortal desolation which is the revenge, as he [<i>Indicating</i>
<font size="-1">SON.</font>] scornfully said of the Demon of
Experiment, that unfortunately hides in me. Thus, sir, you see
when faith is lacking, it becomes impossible to create certain
states of happiness, for we lack the necessary humility.
Vaingloriously, we try to substitute ourselves for this faith,
creating thus for the rest of the world a reality which we
believe after their fashion, while, actually, it doesn't exist.
For each one of us has his own reality to be respected before
God, even when it is harmful to one's very self.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. There is something in what you say. I
assure you all this interests me very much. I begin to think
there's the stuff for a drama in all this, and not a bad drama
either.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>coming forward</i>]. When you've
got a character like me.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>shutting her up, all excited to learn
the decision of the</i> <font size="-1">MANAGER</font>]. You be
quiet!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>reflecting, heedless of
interruption</i>]. It's new...hem...yes...</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Absolutely new!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. You've got a nerve though, I must say, to
come here and fling it at me like this...</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. You will understand, sir, born as we are
for the stage...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Are you amateur actors then?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. No. I say born for the stage,
because...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Oh, nonsense. You're an old hand, you
know.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. No sir, no. We act that r&ocirc;le for
which we have been cast, that r&ocirc;le which we are given in
life. And in my own case, passion itself, as usually happens,
becomes a trifle theatrical when it is exalted.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Well, well, that will do. But you see,
without an author...I could give you the address of an author if
you like...</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. No, no. Look here! You must be the
author.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. I? What are you talking about?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Yes, you, you! Why not?</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Because I have never been an author:
that's why.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Then why not turn author now? Everybody
does it. You don't want any special qualities. Your task is made
much easier by the fact that we are all here alive before
you...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. It won't do.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. What? When you see us live our drama...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Yes, that's all right. But you want
someone to write it.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. No, no. Someone to take it down, possibly,
while we play it, scene by scene! It will be enough to sketch it
out at first, and then try it over.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Well...I am almost tempted. It's a bit of
an idea. One might have a shot at it.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Of course. You'll see what scenes will come
out of it. I can give you one, at once...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. By Jove, it tempts me. I'd like to have a
go at it. Let's try it out. Come with me to my office.
[<i>Turning to the</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font>.] You are at
liberty for a bit, but don't step out of the theatre for long. In
a quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, all back here again! [<i>To
the</i> <font size="-1">FATHER.</font>] We'll see what can be
done. Who knows if we don't get something really extraordinary
out of it?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. There's no doubt about it. They
[<i>Indicating the</i> <font size="-1">CHARACTERS</font>.] had
better come with us too, hadn't they?</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Yes, yes. Come on! come on! [<i>Moves away

punctual, please! [<font size="-1">MANAGER</font> <i>and the

<p><b>Leading Man</b>. Is he serious? What the devil does be want
to do?</p>

<p><b>Juvenile Lead</b>. This is rank madness.</p>

<p><b>Third Actor.</b> Does he expect to knock up a drama in five
minutes?</p>

<p><b>Juvenile Lead</b>. Like the improvisers!</p>

<p><b>Leading Lady.</b> If he thinks I'm going to take part in a
joke like this...</p>

<p><b>Juvenile Lead</b>. I'm out of it anyway.</p>

<p><b>Fourth Actor.</b> I should like to know who they are..
[<i>Alludes to</i> <font size="-1">CHARACTERS</font>].</p>

<p><b>Third Actor.</b> What do you suppose? Madmen or
rascals!</p>

<p><b>Juvenile Lead</b>. And he takes them seriously!</p>

<p><b>L'Ing&eacute;nue.</b> Vanity! He fancies himself as an

has come to this...well I'm...</p>

<p class="nhi"><i>The stage call-bells ring to warn the company
that the play it about to begin again.</i></p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> <i>comes out of the</i> <font size=

<p class="d">Nonsense! nonsense! Do it yourselves! I'm not going
to mix myself up in this mess. [<i>Turning to the</i> <font size=

and seeming perplexed.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>stops, bends over the</i> <font
size="-1">CHILD</font> <i>and takes the latter's face between her
hands</i>]. My little darling! You're frightened, aren't you? You
don't know where we are, do you? [<i>Pretending to reply to a
question of the</i> <font size="-1">CHILD.</font>] What is the
stage? It's a place, baby, you know, where people play at being
serious, a place where they act comedies. We've got to act a
comedy now, dead serious, you know; and you're in it also, little
one. [<i>Embraces her, pressing the little head to her breast,
and rocking the</i> <font size="-1">CHILD</font> <i>for a
moment.</i>] Oh darling, darling, what a horrid comedy you've got
to play! What a wretched part they've found for you! A garden...a
fountain...look...just suppose, kiddie, it's here. Where, you
say? Why, right here in the middle. It's all pretence you know.
That's the trouble, my pet: it's all make-belive here. It's
better to imagine it though, because if they fix it up for you,
it'll only be painted cardboard, painted cardboard for the
rockery, the water, the plants...Ah, but I think a baby like this
one would sooner have a make-believe fountain than a real one, so
she could play with it. What a joke it'll be for the others! But
for you, alas! not quite such a joke: you who are real, baby
dear, and really play by a real fountain that is big and green
and beautiful, with ever so many bamboos around it that are
reflected in the water, and a whole lot of little ducks swimming
about...No, Rosetta, no, your mother doesn't bother about you on
account of that wretch of a son there. I'm in the devil of a
temper, and as for that lad...[<i>Seizes</i> <font size=
"-1">BOY</font> <i>by the arm to force him to take one of his
hands out of his pockets.</i>] What have you got there? What are
you hiding? [<i>Pulls his hand out of his pocket, looks into it
and catches the glint of a revolver.</i>] Ah! where did you get
this? [<i>The</i> <font size="-1">BOY,</font> <i>very pale in the
face, looks at her, but does not answer</i>]. Idiot! If I'd been
in your place, instead of killing myself, I'd have shot one of
those two, or both of them: father and son. [<i>The</i> <font
size="-1">FATHER</font> <i>enters from the office, all excited
from his work. The</i> <font size="-1">MANAGER</font> <i>follows
him.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Come on, come on dear! Come here for a
minute! We've arranged everything. It's all fixed up.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>also excited</i>]. If you please, young
lady, there are one or two points to settle still. Will you come
along?</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>following him towards the
office</i>]. Ouff! what's the good, if you've arranged
everything. [<i>The</i> <font size="-1">FATHER,</font> <font
size="-1">MANAGER</font> <i>and</i> <font size=

<p><b>The Son</b> [<i>looking at the three entering office</i>].
Oh this is fine, fine! And to think I can't even get away!
[<i>The</i> <font size="-1">MOTHER</font> <i>attempts to look at
him, but lowers her eyes immediately when</i> <font size=

again at the</i> <font size="-1">SON,</font> <i>and speaks with
humble tones, trying to draw him into conversation.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. And isn't my punishment the worst of all?
[<i>Then seeing from the</i> <font size="-1">SON's</font>
<i>manner that he will not bother himself about her.</i>] My God!
Why are you so cruel? Isn't it enough for one person to support
all this torment? Must you then insist on others seeing it
also?</p>

<p><b>The Son</b> [<i>half to himself, meaning the</i> <font
size="-1">MOTHER</font> <i>to hear, however</i>]. And they want
to put it on the stage! If there was at least a reason for it! He
thinks he has got at the meaning of it all. Just as if each one
of us in every circumstance of life couldn't find his own
explanation of it! [<i>Pauses.</i>] He complains he was
discovered in a place where he ought not to have been seen, in a
moment of his life which ought to have remained hidden and kept
out of the reach of that convention which he has to maintain for
other people. And what about my case? Haven't I had to reveal
what no son ought ever to reveal: how father and mother live and
are man and wife for themselves quite apart from that idea of
father and mother which we give them? When this idea is revealed,
our life is then linked at one point only to that man and that
woman; and as such it should shame them, shouldn't it?</p>

yellow, ornamented with flowers -- very large! arid most
comfortable!</p>

<p><b>Property Man</b>. There isn't one like that.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. It doesn't matter. Use the one we've

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Doesn't matter? it's most

<p><b>Property Man</b>. That's all right, Miss. We've got any

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>to the</i> <font size=

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Yes, several, several!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>to</i> <font size=

paper.</i>] And now I'm going to ask you to do something out of
the ordinary.</p>

<p><b>Prompter.</b> Take it down in shorthand?</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>pleasantly surprised</i>]. Exactly! Can
you do shorthand?</p>

<p><b>Prompter.</b> Yes, a little.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Good! [<i>Turning to a</i> <font size=

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>to</i> <font size=

[<i>Then addressing the</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font>.] Clear
the stage, ladies and gentlemen! Come over here [<i>Pointing to

<p><b>Leading Lady.</b> But, excuse me, we...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>guessing her thought</i>]. Don't worry!
You won't have to improvise.</p>

<p><b>Leading Man</b>. What have we to do then?</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Nothing. For the moment you just watch and
listen. Everybody will get his part written out afterwards. At
present we're going to try the thing as best we can. They're
going to act now.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>as if fallen from the clouds into the
confusion of the stage</i>]. We? What do you mean, if you please,
by a rehearsal?</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. A rehearsal for them. [<i>Points to
the</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font>.]</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. But since we are the characters...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. All right: "characters" then, if you
insist on calling yourselves such. But here, my dear sir, the
characters don't act. Here the actors do the acting. The
characters are there, in the "book" [<i>Pointing towards</i>
<font size="-1">PROMPTER</font>'S <i>box.</i>] -- when there is a
"book"!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. I won't contradict you; but excuse me, the
actors aren't the characters. They want to be, they pretend to
be, don't they? Now if these gentlemen here are fortunate enough
to have us alive before them...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Oh this is grand! You want to come before
the public yourselves then?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. As we are...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. I can assure you it would be a magnificent
spectacle!</p>

<p><b>Leading Man</b>. What's the use of us here anyway then?</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. You're not going to pretend that you can
act? It makes me laugh! [<i>The</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font>
<i>laugh.</i>] There, you see, they are laughing at the notion.
But, by the way, I must cast the parts. That won't be difficult.
They cast themselves. [<i>To the</i> <font size="-1">SECOND LADY
LEAD.</font>] You play the Mother. [<i>To the</i> <font size=
"-1">FATHER.</font>] We must find her a name.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Amalia, sir.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. But that is the real name of your wife. We
don't want to call her by her real name.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Why ever not, if it is her name?... Still,
perhaps, if that lady must...[<i>Makes a slight motion of the
hand to indicate the</i> <font size="-1">SECOND LADY
LEAD.</font>] I see this woman here [<i>Means the</i> <font size=
"-1">MOTHER.</font>] as Amalia. But do as you like. [<i>Gets more
and more confused.</i>] I don't know what to say to you. Already,
I begin to hear my own words ring false, as if they had another
sound...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Don't you worry about it. It'll be our job
to find the right tones. And as for her name, if you want her
Amalia, Amalia it shall be; and if you don't like it, we'll find
another! For the moment though, we'll call the characters in this
way: [<i>To</i> <font size="-1">JUVENILE LEAD.</font>] You are
the Son. [<i>To the</i> <font size="-1">LEADING LADY.</font>] You
naturally are the Step-Daughter...</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>excitedly</i>]. What? what? I,
that woman there? [<i>Bursts out laughing.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>angry</i>]. What is there to laugh
at?</p>

<p><b>Leading Lady.</b>[<i>indignant</i>]. Nobody has ever dared
to laugh at me. I insist on being treated with respect; otherwise
I go away.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. No, no, excuse me...I am not
laughing at you...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>to</i> <font size=
"-1">STEP-DAUGHTER</font>]. You ought to feel honored to be
played by...</p>

<p><b>Leading Lady.</b>[<i>at once, contemptuously</i>]. "That
woman there"...</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. But I wasn't speaking of you, you
know. I was speaking of myself -- whom I can't see at all in you!
That is all. I don't know...but...you ...aren't in the least like
me...</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. True. Here's the point. Look here, sir, our
temperaments, our souls...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Temperament, soul, be hanged! Do you
suppose the spirit of the piece is in you? Nothing of the
kind!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. What, haven't we our own temperaments, our
own souls?</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Not at all. Your soul or whatever you like
to call it takes shape here. The actors give body and form to it,
voice and gesture. And my actors -- I may tell you -- have given
expression to much more lofty material than this little drama of
yours, which may or may not hold up on the stage. But if it does,
the merit of it, believe me, will be due to my actors.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. I don't dare contradict you, sir; but,
believe me, it is a terrible suffering for us who are as we are,
with these bodies of ours, these features to see...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>cutting him short and out of
patience</i>]. Good heavens! The make-up will remedy all that,
man, the make-up...</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Maybe. But the voice, the gestures...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Now, look here! On the stage, you as
yourself, cannot exist. The actor here acts you, and that's an
end to it!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. I understand. And now I think I see why our
author who conceived us as we are, all alive, didn't want to put
us on the stage after all. I haven't the least desire to offend
your actors. Far from it! But when I think that I am to be acted
by...I don't know by whom...</p>

<p><b>Leading Man</b> [<i>on his dignity</i>]. By me, if you've
no objection!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>humbly, melliflously</i>]. Honored, I
assure you, sir. [<i>Bows.</i>] Still, I must say that try as
this gentleman may, with all his good will and wonderful art, to
absorb me into himself...</p>

<p><b>Leading Man</b>. Oh chuck it! "Wonderful art!" Withdraw
that, please!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. The performance he will give, even doing
his best with make-up to look like me...</p>

<p><b>Leading Man</b>. It will certainly be a bit difficult!
[<i>The</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font> <i>laugh.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Exactly! It will be difficult to act me as
I really am. The effect will be rather -- apart from the make-up
-- according as to how he supposes I am, as he senses me -- if he
does sense me -- and not as I inside of myself feel myself to be.
It seems to me then that account should be taken of this by
everyone whose duty it may become to criticize us...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Heavens! The man's starting to think about
the critics now! Let them say what they like. It's up to us to
put on the play if we can. [<i>Looking around.</i>] Come on! come
on! Is the stage set? [<i>To the</i> <font size=
"-1">ACTORS</font> <i>and</i> <font size="-1">CHARACTERS</font>.]
Stand back -- stand back! Let me see, and don't let's lose any
more time! [<i>To the</i> <font size="-1">STEP-DAUGHTER.</font>]
Is it all right as it is now?</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Well, to tell the truth, I don't
recognize the scene.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. My dear lady, you can't possibly suppose
that we can construct that shop of Madame Pace piece by piece
here? [<i>To the</i> <font size="-1">FATHER.</font>] You said a
white room with flowered wall paper, didn't you?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Yes.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Well then. We've got the furniture right
more or less. Bring that little table a bit further forward.
[<i>The</i> <font size="-1">STAGE HANDS</font> <i>obey the order.
To</i> <font size="-1">PROPERTY MAN.</font>] You go and find an
envelope, if possible, a pale blue one; and give it to that
gentleman. [<i>Indicates</i> <font size="-1">FATHER.</font>]</p>

<p><b>Property Man.</b> An ordinary envelope?</p>

<p><b>Manager and Father.</b> Yes, yes, an ordinary envelope.</p>

<p><b>Property Man.</b> At once, sir. [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Ready, everyone! First scene -- the Young
Lady. [<i>The</i> <font size="-1">LEADING LADY</font> <i>comes

the</i> <font size="-1">STEP-DAUGHTER.</font>] You just watch
--</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>adding at once</i>]. How I shall
play it, how I shall live it!...</p>

<p><b>Leading Lady.</b>[<i>offended</i>]. I shall live it also,
you may be sure, as soon as I begin!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>with his hands to his head</i>]. Ladies
and gentlemen, if you please! No more useless discussions! Scene
I: the young lady with Madame Pace: Oh! [<i>Looks around as if
lost.</i>] And this Madame Pace, where is she?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. She isn't with us, sir.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Then what the devil's to be done?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. But she is alive too.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Yes, but where is she?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. One minute. Let me speak! [<i>Turning to
the</i> <font size="-1">ACTRESSES</font>.] If these ladies would
be so good as to give me their hats for a moment...</p>

<p><b>The Actresses</b> [<i>half surprised, half laughing, in
chorus</i>]. What?</p>

<p class="d">Why?</p>

<p class="d">Our hats?</p>

<p class="d">What does he say?</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. What are you going to do with the ladies'
hats? [<i>The</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font>
<i>laugh.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Oh nothing. I just want to put them on
these pegs for a moment. And one of the ladies will be so kind as
to take off her mantle...</p>

<p><b>The Actors.</b> Oh, what d'you think of that?</p>

<p class="d">Only the mantle?</p>

<p class="d">He must be mad.</p>

<p><b>Some Actresses.</b> But why?</p>

<p class="d">Mantles as well?</p>

<p><b>The Father.</b> To hang them up here for a moment. Please
be so kind, will you?</p>

<p><b>The Actresses</b> [<i>taking off their hats, one or two
also their cloaks, and going to hang them on the racks</i>].
After all, why not?</p>

<p class="d">There you are!</p>

<p class="d">This is really funny.</p>

<p class="d">We've got to put them on show.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Exactly; just like that, on show.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. May we know why?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. I'll tell you. Who knows if, by arranging
the stage for her, she does not come here herself, attracted by
the very articles of her trade? [<i>Inviting the</i> <font size=
"-1">ACTORS</font> <i>to look towards the exit at back of
stage.</i>] Look! Look!</p>

<p class="nh">[<i>The door at the back of stage opens and</i>
<font size="-1">MADAME PACE</font> <i>enters and takes a few
steps forward. She is a fat, oldish woman with puffy oxygenated
hair. She is rouged and powdered, dressed with a comical elegance
in black silk. Round her waist is a long silver chain from which
hangs a pair of scissors. The</i> <font size=

stupor of the actors.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>turning towards her</i>]. There

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>radiant</i>]. It's she! I said so,
didn't I? There she is!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>conquering his surprise, and then
becoming indignant</i>]. What sort of a trick is this?</p>

<p><b>Leading Man</b> [<i>almost at the same time</i>]. What's
going to happen next?</p>

<p><b>Juvenile Lead</b>. Where does she come from?</p>

<p><b>L'Ing&eacute;nue.</b> They've been holding her in reserve,
I guess.</p>

<p><b>Leading Lady.</b> A vulgar trick!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>dominating the protests</i>]. Excuse me,
all of you! Why are you so anxious to destroy in the name of a
vulgar, commonplace sense of truth, this reality which comes to
birth attracted and formed by the magic of the stage itself,
which has indeed more right to live here than you, since it is
much truer than you -- if you don't mind my saying so? Which is
the actress among you who is to play Madame Pace? Well, here is
Madame Pace herself. And you will allow, I fancy, that the
actress who acts her will be less true than this woman here, who
is herself in person. You see my daughter recognized her and went
over to her at once. Now you're going to witness the scene!</p>

<p class="nh">[<i>But the scene between the</i> <font size=

the</i> <font size="-1">STEP-DAUGHTER'S</font> <i>chin to raise
her head, they observe her at first with great attention, but
hearing her speak in an unintelligible manner their interest
begins to wane.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Well? well?</p>

<p><b>Leading Man</b>. What does she say?</p>

<p><b>Leading Lady.</b> One can't hear a word.</p>

<p><b>Juvenile Lead</b>. Louder! Louder please!</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>leaving</i> <font size=
"-1">MADAME PACE,</font> <i>who smiles a Sphinx-like smile, and
advancing towards the actors</i>]. Louder? Louder? What are you
talking about? These aren't matters which can be shouted at the
top of one's voice. If I have spoken them out loud, it was to
shame him and have my revenge. [<i>Indicates</i> <font size=
"-1">FATHER.</font>] But for Madame it's quite a different
matter.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Indeed? indeed? But here, you know, people
have got to make themselves heard, my dear. Even we who are on
the stage can't hear you. What will it be when the public's in
the theatre? And anyway, you can very well speak up now among
yourselves, since we shan't be present to listen to you as we are
now. You've got to pretend to be alone in a room at the back of a
shop where no one can hear you.</p>

<p class="nh">[<i>The</i> <font size="-1">STEP-DAUGHTER</font>
<i>coquettishly and with a touch of malice makes a sign of
disagreement two or three times with her finger.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. What do you mean by no?</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>sotto voce, mysteriously</i>].
There's someone who will hear us if she [<i>Indicating</i> <font
size="-1">MADAME PACE.</font>] speaks out loud.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>in consternation</i>]. What? Have you
got someone else to spring on us now? [<i>The</i> <font size=
"-1">ACTORS</font> <i>burst out laughing.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. No, no sir. She is alluding to me. I've got
to be here -- there behind that door, in waiting; and Madame Pace
knows it. In fact, if you will allow me, I'll go there at once,
so I can be quite ready. [<i>Moves away.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>stopping him</i>]. No! Wait! wait! We
must observe the conventions of the theatre. Before you are
ready...</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>interrupting him</i>]. No, get on
with it at once! I'm just dying, I tell you, to act this scene.
If he's ready, I'm more than ready.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>shouting</i>]. But, my dear young lady,
first of all, we must have the scene between you and this
lady...[<i>Indicates</i> <font size="-1">MADAME PACE.</font>] Do
you understand?...</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Good Heavens! She's been telling me
what you know already: that mamma's work is badly done again,
that the material's ruined; and that if I want her to continue to
help us in our misery I must be patient...</p>

<p><b>Madame Pace</b> [<i>coming forward with an air of great
importance</i>]. Yes indeed, sir, I no wanta take advantage of
her, I no wanta be hard...</p>

<p class="nh">[<i>Note.</i> <font size="-1">MADAME PACE</font>
<i>is supposed to talk in a jargon half Italian, half
English.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>alarmed</i>]. What? What? She talks
like that? [<i>The</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font> <i>burst out
laughing again.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>also laughing</i>]. Yes yes,
that's the way she talks, half English, half Italian! Most
comical it is!</p>

<p><b>Madame Pace</b>. Itta seem not verra polite gentlemen
laugha atta me eef I trya best speaka English.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. <i>Diamine!</i> Of course! Of course! Let
her talk like that! Just what we want. Talk just like that,
Madame, if you please! The effect will be certain. Exactly what
was wanted to put a little comic relief into the crudity of the
situation. Of course she talks like that! Magnificent!</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Magnificent? Certainly! When certain
suggestions are made to one in language of that kind, the effect
is certain, since it seems almost a joke. One feels inclined to
laugh when one hears her talk about an "old signore" "who wanta
talka nicely with you." Nice old signore, eh, Madame?</p>

<p><b>Madame Pace</b>. Not so old my dear, not so old! And even
if you no lika him, he won't make any scandal!</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b> [<i>jumping up amid the amazement and
consternation of the actors who had not been noticing her.</i>
<font size="-1">THEY</font> <i>move to restrain her</i>]. You old
devil! You murderess!</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>running over to calm her</i>
<font size="-1">MOTHER</font>]. Calm yourself, Mother, calm
yourself! Please don't ...</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>going to her also at the same time</i>].
Calm yourself! Don't get excited! Sit down now!</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. Well then, take that woman away out of my
sight!</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>to</i> <font size=
"-1">MANAGER</font>]. It is impossible for my mother to remain
here.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>to</i> <font size="-1">MANAGER</font>].
They can't be here together. And for this reason, you see: that
woman there was not with us when we came...If they are on
together, the whole thing is given away inevitably, as you
see.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. It doesn't matter. This is only a first
rough sketch -- just to get an idea of the various points of the
scene, even confusedly...[<i>Turning to the</i> <font size=

along, my dear lady, sit down now, and let's get on with the

<p><b>Madame Pace</b> [<i>offended</i>]. No, no, grazie. I not do

that, yes! I'm here with bowed head, modest like. Come on! Out
with your voice! Say "Good morning, Miss" in that peculiar tone,
that special tone...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Excuse me, but are you the Manager, or am
I? [<i>To the</i> <font size="-1">FATHER,</font> <i>who looks
undecided and perplexed.</i>] Get on with it, man! Go down there
to the back of the stage. You needn't go off. Then come right
forward here.</p>

<p class="nh">[<i>The</i> <font size="-1">FATHER</font> <i>does

<p><b>L'Ing&eacute;nue</b> [<i>interrupting</i>]. I say...those

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>furious</i>]. Silence! silence! Don't

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>continuing</i>]. No thank you,
sir.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Oh, come now. Don't talk like that. You
must take it. I shall be upset if you don't. There are some
lovely little hats here; and then -- Madame will be pleased. She
expects it, anyway, you know.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. No, no! I couldn't wear it!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Oh, you're thinking about what they'd say
at home if they saw you come in with a new hat? My dear girl,
there's always a way round these little matters, you know.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>all keyed up</i>]. No, it's not
that -- I couldn't wear it because I am...as you see...you might
have noticed...[<i>Showing her black dress.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>...in mourning! Of course: I beg your pardon:
I'm frightfully sorry...</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>forcing herself to conquer her
indignation and nausea</i>]. Stop! Stop! It's I who must thank
you. There's no need for you to feel mortified or specially
sorry. Don't think any more of what I've said. [<i>Tries to

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>interrupting and turning to the</i>

as we arranged. [<i>To the</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font>.]
Pretty good that scene, where he offers her the hat, eh?</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. The best's coming now. Why can't we
go on?</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Have a little patience! [<i>To the</i>
<font size="-1">ACTORS</font>.] Of course, it must be treated
rather lightly.</p>

<p><b>Leading Man</b>. Still, with a bit of go in it!</p>

<p><b>Leading Lady.</b> Of course! It's easy enough! [<i>To</i>
<font size="-1">LEADING MAN</font>.] Shall you and I try it

<p><b>Leading Man</b>. Why, yes! I'll prepare my entrance.
[<i>Exit in order to make his entrance.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>to</i> <font size="-1">LEADING

here...oh, where are you going?</p>

<p><b>Leading Lady.</b> One minute. I want to put my hat on
again. [<i>Goes over to hat-rack and puts her hat on her

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Good! You stay here with your head bowed
down a bit.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. But she isn't dressed in black.</p>

<p><b>Leading Lady.</b> But I shall be, and much more effectively
than you.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>to</i> <font size=

able to learn something. [<i>Clapping his hands.</i>] Come on!

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>furious</i>]. Silence! And you please

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Forgive me, sir, but it's natural
enough. This lady [<i>Indicating</i> <font size="-1">LEADING
LADY.</font>] stands there still; but if she is supposed to be
me, I can assure you that if I heard anyone say "Good afternoon"
in that manner and in that tone, I should burst out laughing as I
did.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Yes, yes, the manner, the tone...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Nonsense! Rubbish! Stand aside and let me
see the action.</p>

<p><b>Leading Man</b>. If I've got to represent an old fellow
who's coming into a house of an equivocal character...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Don't listen to them, for Heaven's sake!
Do it again! It goes fine. [<i>Waiting for the</i> <font size=

<p><b>Leading Man</b>. Good afternoon, Miss.</p>

<p><b>Leading Lady.</b> Good afternoon.</p>

Ah, but...I say...this is not the first time that you have come

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Good, but not quite so heavily. Like this.
[<i>Acts himself.</i>] "This isn't the first time that you have
come here"...[<i>To</i> <font size="-1">LEADING LADY.</font>] And
you say: "No, sir."</p>

<p><b>Leading Lady.</b> No, sir.</p>

<p><b>Leading Man</b>. You've been here before, more than
once.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. No, no, stop! Let her nod "yes" first.
"You've been here before, eh?" [<i>The</i> <font size=

her eyes as though in disgust. Then</i> <font size=

Oh my God! [<i>Puts a hand to her mouth to prevent herself from

matter?</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Nothing, nothing!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>to</i> <font size="-1">LEADING

there's no need to be so shy, is there? May I take off your
hat?</p>

<p class="nh">[<i>The</i> <font size="-1">LEADING MAN</font>

you!</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Forgive me! forgive me!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. You haven't any manners: that's what it
is! You go too far.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>endeavouring to intervene</i>]. Yes,
it's true, but excuse her...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Excuse what? It's absolutely
disgusting.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Yes, sir, but believe me, it has such a
strange effect when...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Strange? Why strange? Where is it
strange?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. No, sir; I admire your actors -- this
gentleman here, this lady; but they are certainly not us!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. I should hope not. Evidently they cannot
be you, if they are actors.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Just so: actors! Both of them act our parts
exceedingly well. But, believe me, it produces quite a different
effect on us. They want to be us, but they aren't, all the
same.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. What is it then anyway?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Something that is...that is theirs -- and
no longer ours...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. But naturally, inevitably. I've told you
so already.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Yes, I understand...I understand...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Well then, let's have no more of it!
[<i>Turning to the</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font>.] We'll have
the rehearsals by ourselves, afterwards, in the ordinary way. I
never could stand rehearsing with the author present. He's never
satisfied! [<i>Turning to</i> <font size="-1">FATHER</font>
<i>and</i> <font size="-1">STEP-DAUGHTER.</font>] Come on! Let's
get on with it again; and try and see if you can't keep from
laughing.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Oh, I shan't laugh any more. There's
a nice little bit coming for me now: you'll see.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Well then: when she says "Don't think any
more of what I've said. I must forget, etc.," you [<i>Addressing
the</i> <font size="-1">FATHER.</font>] come in sharp with "I
understand, I understand"; and then you ask her...</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>interrupting</i>]. What?</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Why she is in mourning.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Not at all! See here: when I told
him that it was useless for me to be thinking about my wearing
mourning, do you know how he answered me? "Ah well," he said,
"then let's take off this little frock."</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Great! Just what we want, to make a riot
in the theatre!</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. But it's the truth!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. What does that matter? Acting is our
business here. Truth up to a certain point, but no further.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. What do you want to do then?</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. You'll see, you'll see! Leave it to
me.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. No sir! What you want to do is to
piece together a little romantic sentimental scene out of my
disgust, out of all the reasons, each more cruel and viler than
the other, why I am what I am. He is to ask me why I'm in
mourning; and I'm to answer with tears in my eyes, that it is
just two months since papa died. No sir, no! He's got to say to
me; as he did say: "Well, let's take off this little dress at
once." And I; with my two months' mourning in my heart, went
there behind that screen, and with these fingers tingling with
shame...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>running his hands through his
hair</i>]. For Heaven's sake! What are you saying?</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>crying out excitedly</i>]. The
truth! The truth!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. It may be. I don't deny it, and I can
understand all your horror; but you must surely see that you
can't have this kind of thing on the stage. It won't go.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Not possible, eh? Very well! I'm
much obliged to you -- but I'm off!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Now be reasonable! Don't lose your
temper!</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. I won't stop here! I won't! I can
see you've fixed it all up with him in your office. All this talk
about what is possible for the stage...I understand! He wants to
get at his complicated "cerebral drama," to have his famous
remorses and torments acted; but I want to act my part, my
part!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>annoyed, shaking his shoulders</i>].
Ah! Just your part! But, if you will pardon me, there are other
parts than yours: His [<i>Indicating the</i> <font size=
"-1">FATHER.</font>] and hers! [<i>Indicating the</i> <font size=
"-1">MOTHER.</font>] On the stage you can have a character
becoming too prominent and overshadowing all the others. The
thing is to pack them all into a neat little framework and then
act what is actable. I am aware of the fact that everyone has his
own interior life which he wants very much to put forward. But
the difficulty lies in this fact: to set out just so much as is
necessary for the stage, taking the other characters into
consideration, and at the same time hint at the unrevealed
interior life of each. I am willing to admit, my dear young lady,
that from your point of view it would be a fine idea if each
character could tell the public all his troubles in a nice
monologue or a regular one hour lecture. [<i>Good humoredly.</i>]
You must restrain yourself, my dear, and in your own interest,
too; because this fury of yours, this exaggerated disgust you
show, may make a bad impression, you know. After you have
confessed to me that there were others before him at Madame
Pace's and more than once...</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>bowing her head, impressed</i>].
It's true. But remember those others mean him for me all the
same.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>not understanding</i>]. What? The
others? What do you mean?</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. For one who has gone wrong, sir, he
who was responsible for the first fault is responsible for all
that follow. He is responsible for my faults, was, even before I
was born. Look at him, and see if it isn't true!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Well, well! And does the weight of so much
responsibility seem nothing to you? Give him a chance to act it,
to get it over!</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. How? How can he act all his "noble
remorses," all his "moral torments," if you want to spare him the
horror of being discovered one day -- after he had asked her what
he did ask her -- in the arms of her, that already fallen woman,
that child, sir, that child he used to watch come out of school?
[<font size="-1">SHE</font> <i>is moved.</i>] [<i>The</i> <font
size="-1">MOTHER</font> <i>at this point is overcome with
emotion, and breaks out into a fit of crying.</i> <font size=
"-1">ALL</font> <i>are touched. A long pause.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>as soon as the</i> <font size=
"-1">MOTHER</font> <i>becomes a little quieter, adds resolutely
and gravely</i>]. At present, we are unknown to the public.
Tomorrow, you will act us as you wish, treating us in your own
manner. But do you really want to see drama, do you want to see
it flash out as it really did?</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Of course! That's just what I do want, so
I can use as much of it as is possible.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Well then, ask that Mother there to
leave us.</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b> [<i>changing her low plaint into a sharp
cry</i>]. No! No! Don't permit it, sir, don't permit it!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. But it's only to try it.</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. I can't bear it. I can't.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. But since it has happened already... I
don't understand!</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. It's taking place now. It happens all the
time. My torment isn't a pretended one. I live and feel every
minute of my torture. Those two children there -- have you heard
them speak? They can't speak any more. They cling to me to keep
up my torment actual and vivid for me. But for themselves, they
do not exist, they aren't any more. And she [<i>Indicating
the</i> <font size="-1">STEP-DAUGHTER.</font>] has run away, she
has left me, and is lost. If I now see her here before me, it is
only to renew for me the tortures I have suffered for her
too.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. The eternal moment! She [<i>Indicating
the</i> <font size="-1">STEP-DAUGHTER.</font>] is here to catch
me, fix me, and hold me eternally in the stocks for that one
fleeting and shameful moment of my life. She can't give it up!
And you sir, cannot either fairly spare me it.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. I never said I didn't want to act it. It
will form, as a matter of fact, the nucleus of the whoie first
act right up to her surprise. [<i>Indicates the</i> <font size=
"-1">MOTHER.</font>]</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Just so! This is my punishment: the passion
in all of us that must culminate in her final cry.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. I can hear it still in my ears. It's
driven me mad, that cry! -- You can put me on as you like; it
doesn't matter. Fully dressed, if you like -- provided I have at
least the arm bare; because, standing like this [<i>She goes
close to the</i> <font size="-1">FATHER</font> <i>and leans her
head on his breast.</i>] with my head so, and my arms round his
neck, I saw a vein pulsing in my arm here; and then, as if that
live vein had awakened disgust in me, I closed my eyes like this,
and let my head sink on his breast. [<i>Turning to the</i> <font
size="-1">MOTHER.</font>] Cry out mother! Cry out! [<i>Buries
head in</i> <font size="-1">FATHER'S</font> <i>breast, and with
her shoulders raised as if to prevent her hearing the cry, adds
in tones of intense emotion.</i>] Cry out as you did then!</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b> [<i>coming forward to separate them</i>].
No! My daughter, my daughter! [<i>And after having pulled her
away from him.</i>] You brute! you brute! She is my daughter!
Don't you see she's my daughter?</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>walking backwards towards
footlights</i>]. Fine! fine! Damned good! And then, of course --
curtain!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>going towards him excitedly</i>]. Yes,
of course, because that's the way it really happened.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>convinced and pleased</i>]. Oh, yes, no
doubt about it. Curtain here, curtain!</p>

<p class="nh">[<i>At the reiterated cry of The</i> <font size=
"-1">MANAGER</font>, <i>The</i> <font size="-1">MACHINIST</font>
<i>lets the curtain down, leaving The</i> <font size=
"-1">MANAGER</font> <i>and The</i> <font size="-1">FATHER</font>
<i>in front of it before the footlights.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. The darned idiot! I said "curtain" to show
the act should end there, and he goes and lets it down in
earnest. [<i>To the</i> <font size="-1">FATHER,</font> <i>while
he pulls the curtain back to go on to the stage again.</i>] Yes,
yes, it.'s all right. Effect certain! That's the right ending.
I'll guarantee the first act at any rate.</p>

<a name="ActIII"></a>

<h2>ACT III</h2>

<p class="nh"><i>When the curtain goes up again, it is seen that
the stage hands have shifted the bit of scenery used in the last
part, and have rigged up instead at the back of the stage a drop,
with some trees, and one or two wings. A portion of a fountain
basin is visible. The</i> <font size="-1">MOTHER</font> <i>is
sitting on the right with the two children by her side. The</i>
<font size="-1">SON</font> <i>is on the same side, but away from
the others. He seems bored, angry, and full of shame. The</i>
<font size="-1">FATHER</font> <i>and the</i> <font size=
"-1">STEP-DAUGHTER</font> <i>are also seated towards the right
front. On the other side (left) are the</i> <font size=
"-1">ACTORS</font>, <i>much in the positions they occupied before
the curtain was lowered. Only the</i> <font size=
"-1">MANAGER</font> <i>is standing up in the middle of the stage,
with his hand closed over his mouth in the act of
meditating.</i></p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>shaking his shoulders after a brief
pause</i>]. Ah yes: the second act! Leave it to me, leave it all
to me as we arranged, and you'll see! It'll go fine!</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Our entry into his house
[<i>Indicates</i> <font size="-1">FATHER.</font>] in spite of
him...[<i>Indicates the</i> <font size="-1">SON.</font>]</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>out of patience</i>]. Leave it to me, I
tell you!</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Do let it be clear, at any rate,
that it is in spite of my wishes.</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b> [<i>from her corner, shaking her head</i>].
For all the good that's come of it...</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>turning towards her quickly</i>].
It doesn't matter. The more harm done us, the more remorse for
him.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>impatiently</i>]. I understand! Good
Heavens! I understand! I'm taking it into account.</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b> [<i>supplicatingly</i>]. I beg you, sir, to
let it appear quite plain that for conscience' sake I did try in
every way...</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>interrupting indignantly and
continuing for the</i> <font size="-1">MOTHER</font>]...to pacify
me, to dissuade me from spiting him. [<i>To</i> <font size=
"-1">MANAGER</font>.] Do as she wants: satisfy her, because it is
true! I enjoy it immensely. Any how, as you can see, the meeker
she is, the more she tries to get at his heart, the more distant
and aloof does he become.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Are we going to begin this second act or
not?</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. I'm not going to talk any more now-
But I must tell you this: you can't have the whole action take
place in the garden, as you suggest. It isn't possible!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>.. Why not?</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Because he [<i>Indicates the</i>
<font size="-1">SON</font> <i>again.</i>] is always shut up alone
in his room. And then there's all the part of that poor
dazed-looking boy there which takes place indoors.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Maybe! On the other hand, you will
understand -- we can't change scenes three or four times in one
act.</p>

<p><b>The Leading Man</b>. They used to once.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Yes, when the public was up to the level
of that child there.</p>

<p><b>The Leading Lady</b>. It makes the illusion easier.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>irritated</i>]. The illusion! For
Heaven's sake, don't say illusion. Please don't use that word,
which is particularly painful for us..</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>astounded</i>]. And why, if you
please?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. It's painful, cruel, really cruel; and you
ought to understand that.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. But why? What ought we to say then? The
illusion, I tell you, sir, which we've got to create for the
audience...</p>

<p><b>The Leading Man</b>. With our acting.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. The illusion of a reality.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. I understand; but you, perhaps, do not
understand us. Forgive me! You see...here for you and your
actors, the thing is only -- and rightly so...a kind of game
...</p>

<p><b>The Leading Lady</b> [<i>interrupting indignantly</i>]. A
game! We're not children here, if you please! We are serious
actors.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. I don't deny it. What I mean is the game,
or play, of your art, which has to give, as the gentleman says, a
perfect illusion of reality.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Precisely -- !</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Now, if you consider the fact that we
[<i>Indicates himself and the other five</i> <font size=
"-1">CHARACTERS</font>.], as we are, have no other reality
outside of this illusion...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>astonished, looking at his</i> <font
size="-1">ACTORS</font>, <i>who are also amazed</i>]. And what
does that mean?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>after watching them for a moment with a
wan smile</i>]. As I say, sir, that which is a game of art for
you is our sole reality. [<i>Brief pause. He goes a step or two
nearer the</i> <font size="-1">MANAGER</font> <i>and adds.</i>]
But not only for us, you know, by the way. Just you think it over
well. [<i>Looks him in the eyes.</i>] Can you tell me who you
are?</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>perplexed, half smiling</i>]. What? Who
am I? I am myself.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. And if I were to tell you that that isn't
true, because you and I...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. I should say you were mad -- ! [<i>The</i>
<font size="-1">ACTORS</font> <i>laugh.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. You're quite right to laugh: because we are
all making believe here. [<i>To</i> <font size=
"-1">MANAGER</font>.] And you can therefore object that it's only
for a joke that that gentleman there [<i>Indicates the</i> <font
size="-1">LEADING MAN</font>.], who naturally is himself, has to
be me, who am on the contrary myself -- this thing you see here.
You see I've caught you in a trap! [<i>The</i> <font size=
"-1">ACTORS</font> <i>laugh.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>annoyed</i>]. But we've had all this
over once before. Do you want to begin again?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. No, no! That wasn't my meaning! In fact, I
should like to request you to abandon this game of art
[<i>Looking at the</i> <font size="-1">LEADING LADY</font> <i>as
if anticipating her.</i>] which you are accustomed to play here
with your actors, and to ask you seriously once again: who are
you?</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>astonished and irritated, turning to
his</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font>]. If this fellow here
hasn't got a nerve! A man who calls himself a character comes and
asks me who I am!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>with dignity, but not offended</i>]. A
character, sir, may always ask a man who he is. Because a
character has really a life of his own, marked with his especial
characteristics; for which reason he is always "somebody." But a
man -- I'm not speaking of you now -- may very well be
"nobody."</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Yes, but you are asking these questions of
me, the boss, the manager! Do you understand?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. But only in order to know if you, as you
really are now, see yourself as you once were with all the
illusions that were yours then, with all the things both inside
and outside of you as they seemed to you -- as they were then
indeed for you. Well, sir, if you think of all those illusions
that mean nothing to you now, of all those things which don't
even seem to you to exist any more, while once they were for you,
don't you feel that -- I won't say these boards -- but the very
earth under your feet is sinking away from you when you reflect
that in the same way this you as you feel it today -- all this
present reality of yours -- is fated to seem a mere illusion to
you tomorrow?</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>without having understood much, but
astonished by the specious argument</i>]. Well, well! And where
does all this take us anyway?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Oh, nowhere! It's only to show you that if
we [<i>Indicating the</i> <font size="-1">CHARACTERS</font>.]
have no other reality beyond the illusion, you too must not count
overmuch on your reality as you feel it today, since, like that
of yesterday, it may prove an illusion for you tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>determining to make fun of him</i>].
Ah. excellent! Then you'll be saying next that you, with this
comedy of yours that you brought here to act, are truer and more
real than I am.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>with the greatest seriousness</i>]. But
of course; without doubt!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Ah, really?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Why, I thought you'd understand that from
the beginning.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. More real than I?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. If your reality can change from one day to
another...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. But everyone knows it can change. It is
always changing, the same as anyone else's.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>with a cry</i>]. No, sir, not ours! Look
here! That is the very difference! Our reality doesn't change: it
can't change! It can't be other than what it is, because it is
already fixed for ever. It's terrible. Ours is an immutable
reality which should make you shudder when you approach us if you
are really conscious of the fact that your reality is a mere
transitory and fleeting illusion, taking this form today and that
tomorrow, according to the conditions, according to your will,
your sentiments, which in turn are controlled by an intellect
that shows them to you today in one manner and tomorrow... who
knows how?...Illusions of reality represented in this fatuous
comedy of life that never ends, nor can ever end! Because if
tomorrow it were to end...then why, all would be finished.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Oh for God's sake, will you at least
finish with this philosophizing and let us try and shape this
comedy which you yourself have brought me here? You argue and
philosophize a bit too much, my dear sir.. You know you seem to
me almost, almost...[<i>Stops and looks him over from head to
foot.</i>] Ah, by the way, I think you introduced yourself to me
as a -- what shall ...we say -- a "character," created by an
author who did not afterward care to make a drama of his own
creations.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. It is the simple truth, sir.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Nonsense! Cut that out, please! None of us
believes it, because it isn't a thing, as you must recognize
yourself, which one can believe seriously. If you want to know,
it seems to me you are trying to imitate the manner of a certain
author whom I heartily detest -- I warn you -- although I have
unfortunately bound myself to put on one of his works. As a
matter of fact, I was just starting to rehearse it, when you
arrived. [<i>Turning to the</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font>.]
And this is what we've gained -- out of the frying-pan into the
fire!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. I don't know to what author you may be
alluding, but believe me I feel what I think; and I seem to be
philosophizing only for those who do not think what they feel,
because they blind themselves with their own sentiment. I know
that for many people this self-blinding seems much more "human";
but the contrary is really true. For man never reasons so much
and becomes so introspective as when he suffers; since he is
anxious to get at the cause of his sufferings, to learn who has
produced them, and whether it is just or unjust that he should
have to bear them. On the other hand, when he is happy, he takes
his happiness as it comes and doesn't analyze it, just as if
happiness were his right. The animals suffer without reasoning
about their sufferings. But take the case of a man who suffers
and begins to reason about it. Oh no! it can't be allowed! Let
him suffer like an animal, and then -- ah yet, he is "human"!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Look here! Look here! You're off again,
philosophizing worse than ever.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>.. Because I suffer, sir! I'm not
philosophizing: I'm crying aloud the reason of my sufferings.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>makes brusque movement as he is taken
with a new idea</i>]. I should like to know if anyone has ever
heard of a character who gets right out of his part and perorates
and speechifies as you do. Have you ever heard of a case? I
haven't.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. You have never met such a case, sir,
because authors, as a rule, hide the labour of their creations.
When the characters are really alive before their author, the
latter does nothing but follow them in their action, in their
words, in the situations which they suggest to him; and he has to
will them the way they will themselves -- for there's trouble if
he doesn't. When a character is born, he acquires at once such an
independence, even of his own author, that he can be imagined by
everybody even in many other situations where the author never
dreamed of placing him; and so he acquires for himself a meaning
which the author never thought of giving him..</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Yes, yes, I know this.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. What is there then to marvel at in us?
Imagine such a misfortune for characters as I have described to
you: to be born of an author's fantasy, and be denied life by
him; and then answer me if these characters left alive, and yet
without life, weren't right in doing what they did do and are
doing now, after they have attempted everything in their power to
persuade him to give them their stage life. We've all tried him
in turn, I, she [<i>Indicating the</i> <font size=
"-1">STEP-DAUGHTER.</font>] and she. [<i>Indicating the</i> <font
size="-1">MOTHER.</font>]</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. It's true. I too have sought to
tempt him, many, many times, when he has been sitting at his
writing table, feeling a bit melancholy, at the twilight hour. He
would sit in his armchair too lazy to switch on the light, and
all the shadows that crept into his room were full of our
presence coming to tempt him. [<i>As if she saw herself still
there by the writing table, and was annoyed by the presence of
the</i> <font size="-1">ACTORS</font>.] Oh, if you would only go
away, go away and leave us alone -- mother here with that son of
hers -- I with that Child -- that Boy there always alone -- and
then I with him [<i>Just hints at the</i> <font size=
"-1">FATHER.</font>] -- and then I alone, alone...in those
shadows! [<i>Makes a sudden movement as if in the vision she has
of herself illuminating those shadows she wanted to seize hold of
herself.</i>] Ah! my life! my life! Oh, what scenes we proposed
to him -- and I tempted him more than any of the others!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Maybe. But perhaps it was your fault that
he refused to give us life: because you were too insistent, too
troublesome.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>...Nonsense! Didn't he make me so
himself? [<i>Goes close to the</i> <font size="-1">MANAGER</font>
<i>to tell him. as if in confidence.</i>] In my opinion he
abandoned us in a fit of depression, of disgust for the ordinary
theatre as the public knows it and likes it.</p>

<p><b>The Son</b>. Exactly what it was, sir; exactly that!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Not at all! Don't believe it for a minute.
Listen to me! You'll be doing quite right to modify, as you
suggest, the excesses both of this girl here, who wants to do too
much, and of this young man, who won't do anything at all.</p>

<p><b>The Son</b>. No, nothing!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. You too get over the mark occasionally, my
dear sir, if I may say so.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. I? When? Where?</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Always! Continuously! Then there's this
insistence of yours in trying to make us believe you are a
character. And then too, you must really argue and philosophize
less, you know, much less.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Well, if you want to take away from me the
possibility of representing the torment of my spirit which never
gives me peace, you will be suppressing me: that's all. Every
true man, sir, who is a little above the level of the beasts and
plants does not live for the sake of living, without knowing how
to live; but he lives so as to give a meaning and a value of his
own to life. For me this is everything. I cannot give up this,
just to represent a mere fact as she [<i>Indicating the</i> <font
size="-1">STEP-DAUGHTER.</font>] wants. It's all very well for
her, since her "vendetta" lies in the "fact." I'm not going to do
it. It destroys my raison d'&ecirc;tre.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Your raison d'&ecirc;tre! Oh, we're going
ahead fine! First she starts off, and then you jump in. At this
rate, we'll never finish.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. Now, don't be offended! Have it your own
way -- provided, however, that within the limits of the parts you
assign us each one's sacrifice isn't too great.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. You've got to understand that you can't go
on arguing at your own pleasure. Drama is action, sir, action and
not confounded philosophy.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. All right. I'll do just as much arguing and
philosophizing as everybody does when he is considering his own
torments.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. If the drama permits! But for Heaven's
sake, man, let's get along and come to the scene.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. It seems to me we've got too much
action with our coming into his house. [<i>Indicating</i> <font
size="-1">FATHER.</font>] You said, before, you couldn't change
the scene every five minutes.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Of course not. What we've got to do is to
combine and group up all the facts in one simultaneous,
close-knit, action. We can't have it as you want, with your
little brother wandering like a ghost from room to room, hiding
behind doors and meditating a project which -- what did you say
it did to him?</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Consumes him, sir, wastes him
away!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Well, it may be. And then at the same
time, you want the little girl there to be playing in the
garden...one in the house, and the other in the garden: isn't
that it?</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Yes, in the sun, in the sun! That is
my only pleasure: to see her happy and careless in the garden
after the misery and squalor of the horrible room where we all
four slept together. And I had to sleep with her -- I, do you
understand? -- with my vile contaminated body next to hers; with
her folding me fast in her loving little arms. In the garden,
whenever she spied me, she would run to take me by the hand. She
didn't care for the big flowers, only the little ones; and she
loved to show me them and pet me.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Well then, we'll have it in the garden.
Everything shall happen in the garden; and we'll group the other
scenes there. [<i>Calls a</i> <font size="-1">STAGE HAND.</font>]
Here, a backcloth with trees and something to do as a fountain
basin. [<i>Turning round to look at the back of the stage.</i>]
Ah, you've fixed it up. Good! [<i>To</i> <font size=
"-1">STEP-DAUGHTER.</font>] This is just to give an idea, of
course. The Boy, instead of hiding behind the doors, will wander
about here in the garden, hiding behind the trees.. But it's
going to be rather difficult to find a child to do that scene
with you where she shows you the flowers. [<i>Turning to the</i>
<font size="-1">BOY.</font>] Come forward a little, will you
please? Let's try it now! Come along! come along! [<i>Then seeing
him come shyly forward, full of fear and looking lost.</i>] It's
a nice business, this lad here. What's the matter with him? We'll
have to give him a word or two to say. [<i>Goes close to him,
puts a hand on his shoulders, and Leads him behind one of the
trees.</i>] Come on! come on! Let me see you a little! Hide here
...yes, like that. Try and show your head just a little as if you
were looking for someone...[<i>Goes back to observe the effect,
when the</i> <font size="-1">BOY</font> <i>at once goes through
the action.</i>] Excellent! fine! [<i>Turning to</i> <font size=
"-1">STEP-DAUGHTER.</font>] Suppose the little girl there were to
surprise him as he looks round,, and run over to him, so we could
give him a word or two to say?</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. It's useless to hope he will speak,
as long as that fellow there is here...[<i>indicates the</i>
<font size="-1">SON.</font>] You must send him away first.</p>

<p><b>The Son</b> [<i>jumping up</i>]. Delighted! Delighted! I
don't ask for anything better. [<i>Begins to move away.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>at once stopping him</i>]. No! No!
Where are you going? Wait a bit!</p>

<p class="nh">[<i>The</i> <font size="-1">MOTHER</font> <i>gets
up alarmed and terrified at the thought that he is really about
to go away. Instinctively she lifts her arms to prevent him,
without, however, leaving her seat.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Son</b> [<i>to</i> <font size="-1">MANAGER</font>
<i>who stops him</i>]. I've got nothing to do with this affair.
Let me go please! Let me go!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. What do you mean by saying you've got
nothing to do with this?</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>calmly, with irony</i>]. Don't
bother to stop him: he won't go away.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. He has to act the terrible scene in the
garden with his mother.</p>

<p><b>The Son</b> [<i>suddenly resolute and with dignity</i>]. I
shall act nothing at all. I've said so from the very beginning.
[<i>To the</i> <font size="-1">MANAGER</font>.] Let me go!</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b> [<i>going over to the</i> <font size=
"-1">MANAGER</font>]. Allow me? [<i>Puts down the</i> <font size=
"-1">MANAGER'S</font> <i>arm which is restraining the</i> <font
size="-1">SON.</font>] Well, go away then, if you want to!
[<i>The</i> <font size="-1">SON</font> <i>looks at her with
contempt and hatred. She laughs and says.</i>] You see, he can't,
he can't go away! He is obliged to stay here, indissolubly bound
to the chain. If I, who fly off when that happens which has to
happen, because I can't bear him -- if I am still here and
support that face and expression of his, you can well imagine
that he is unable to move. He has to remain here, has to stop
with that nice father of his, and that mother whose only son he
is. [<i>Turning to the</i> <font size="-1">MOTHER.</font>] Come
on, mother, come along! [<i>Turning to</i> <font size=
"-1">MANAGER</font> <i>to indicate her.</i>] You see, she was
getting up to keep him back. [<i>To the</i> <font size=
"-1">MOTHER,</font> <i>beckoning her with her hand.</i>] Come on!
come on! [<i>Then to</i> <font size="-1">MANAGER</font>.] You can
imagine how little she wants to show these actors of yours what
she really feels; but so eager is she to get near him
that...There, you see? She is willing to act her part. [<i>And in
fact, the</i> <font size="-1">MOTHER</font> <i>approaches him;
and as soon as the</i> <font size="-1">STEP-DAUGHTER</font>
<i>has finished speaking, opens her arms to signify that she
consents.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Son</b> [<i>suddenly</i>]. No! no! If I can't go away,
then I'll stop here; but I repeat: I act nothing!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>to</i> <font size="-1">MANAGER</font>
<i>excitedly</i>]. You can force him, sir.</p>

<p><b>The Son</b>. Nobody can force me.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. I can.</p>

<p><b>The Step-Daughter</b>. Wait a minute, wait...First of all,
the baby has to go to the fountain...[<i>Runs to take the</i>
<font size="-1">CHILD</font> <i>and leads her to the
fountain.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Yes, yes of course; that's it. Both at the
same time.</p>

<p class="nh">[<i>The second</i> <font size="-1">LADY LEAD</font>
<i>and the</i> <font size="-1">JUVENILE LEAD</font> <i>at this
point separate themselves from the group of</i> <font size=

<p><b>The Son</b> [<i>to</i> <font size="-1">MANAGER</font>].
What do you mean by both at the same time? It isn't right. There
was no scene between me and her. [<i>Indicates the</i> <font
size="-1">MOTHER.</font>] Ask her how it was!</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. Yes, it's true. I had come into his
room...</p>

<p><b>The Son</b>. Into my room, do you understand? Nothing to do
with the garden.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. It doesn't matter. Haven't I told you
we've got to group the action?</p>

<p><b>The Son</b> [<i>observing the</i> <font size="-1">JUVENILE
LEAD</font> <i>studying him</i>]. What do you want?</p>

<p><b>The Juvenile Lead.</b> Nothing! I was just looking at
you.</p>

<p><b>The Son</b> [<i>turning towards the second</i> <font size=
"-1">LADY LEAD</font>]. Ah! she's at it too: to re-act her part!
[<i>Indicating the</i> <font size="-1">MOTHER.</font>]</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Exactly! And it seems to me that you ought
to be grateful to them for their interest.</p>

<p><b>The Son</b>. Yes, but haven't you yet perceived that it
isn't possible to live in front of a mirror which not only
freezes us with the image of ourselves, but throws our likeness
back at us with a horrible grimace?</p>

<p><b>The Father</b>. That is true, absolutely true. You must see
that.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>to second</i> <font size="-1">LADY
LEAD</font> <i>and</i> <font size="-1">JUVENILE LEAD</font>].
He's right! Move away from them!</p>

<p><b>The Son</b>. Do as you like. I'm out of this!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Be quiet, you, will you? And let me hear
your mother! [<i>To</i> <font size="-1">MOTHER.</font>] You were
saying you had entered...</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. Yes, into his room, because I couldn't
stand it any longer. I went to empty my heart to him of all the
anguish that tortures me...But as soon as he saw me come
in...</p>

<p><b>The Son</b>. Nothing happened! There was no scene. I went
away, that's all! I don't care for scenes!</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. It's true, true. That's how it was.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Well now, we've got to do this bit between
you and him. It's indispensable.</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b>. I'm ready...when you are ready. If you
could only find a chance for me to tell him what I feel here in
my heart.</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>going to</i> <font size="-1">SON</font>
<i>in a great rage</i>]. You'll do this for your mother, for your
mother, do you understand?</p>

<p><b>The Son</b> [<i>quite determined</i>]. I do nothing!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>taking hold of him and shaking him</i>].
For God's sake, do as I tell you! Don't you hear your mother
asking you for a favor? Haven't you even got the guts to be a
son?</p>

<p><b>The Son</b> [<i>taking hold of the</i> <font size=
"-1">FATHER</font>]. No! No! And for God's sake stop it, or
else...[<i>General agitation.</i>]</p>

<p>[<i>The</i> <font size="-1">MOTHER,</font> <i>frightened,
tries to separate them.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b> [<i>pleading</i>]. Please! please!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>not leaving hold of the</i> <font size=
"-1">SON</font>]. You've got to obey, do you hear?</p>

<p><b>The Son</b> [<i>almost crying from rage</i>]. What does it
mean, this madness you've got? [<i>They separate.</i>] Have you
no decency, that you insist on showing everyone our shame? I
won't do it! I won't! And I stand for the will of our author in
this. He didn't want to put us on the stage, after all!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Man alive! You came here...</p>

<p><b>The Son</b> [<i>indicating</i> <font size=
"-1">FATHER</font>]. He did! I didn't!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Arent't you here now?</p>

<p><b>The Son</b>. It was his wish, and he dragged us along with
him. He's told you not only the things that did happen, but also
things that have never happened at all.</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Well, tell me then what did happen. You
went out of your room without saying a word?</p>

<p><b>The Son</b>. Without a word, so as to avoid a scene!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. And then what did you do?</p>

<p><b>The Son</b>. Nothing...walking in the garden...
[<i>Hesitates for a moment with expression of gloom.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>coming closer to him, interested by his
extraordinary reserve</i>]. Well, well...walking in the
garden...</p>

<p><b>The Son</b> [<i>exasperated</i>]. Why on earth do you
insist? It's horrible! [<i>The</i> <font size="-1">MOTHER</font>
<i>trembles, sobs, and looks towards the fountain.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>slowly observing the glance and turning
towards the</i> <font size="-1">SON</font> <i>with increasing
apprehension</i>]. The baby?</p>

<p><b>The Son</b>. There in the fountain...</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>pointing with tender pity to the</i>
<font size="-1">MOTHER</font>]. She was following him at the
moment...</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>to the</i> <font size="-1">SON</font>
<i>anxiously</i>]. And then you...</p>

<p><b>The Son</b>. I ran over to her; I was jumping in to drag
her out when I saw something that froze my blood... the boy
standing stock still, with eyes like a madman's, watching his
little drowned sister, in the fountain! [<i>The</i> <font size=
"-1">STEP-DAUGHTER</font> <i>bends over the fountain to hide
the</i> <font size="-1">CHILD.</font> <i>She sobs.</i>]
Then...[<i>A revolver shot rings out behind the trees where
the</i> <font size="-1">BOY</font> <i>is hidden.</i>]</p>

<p><b>The Mother</b> [<i>with a cry of terror runs over in that
direction together with several of the</i> <font size=
"-1">ACTORS</font> <i>amid general confusion</i>]. My son! My
son! [<i>Then amid the cries and exclamations one hears her
voice.</i>] Help! Help!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b> [<i>pushing the</i> <font size=
"-1">ACTORS</font> <i>aside while</i> <font size="-1">THEY</font>
<i>lift up the</i> <font size="-1">BOY</font> <i>and carry him
off.</i>] Is he really wounded?</p>

<p><b>Some Actors.</b> He's dead! dead!</p>

<p><b>Other Actors.</b> No, no, it's only make believe, it's only
pretence!</p>

<p><b>The Father</b> [<i>with a terrible cry</i>]. Pretence?
Reality, sir, reality!</p>

<p><b>The Manager</b>. Pretence? Reality? To hell with it all!
Never in my life has such a thing happened to me. I 've lost a
whole day over these people, a whole day!</p>
