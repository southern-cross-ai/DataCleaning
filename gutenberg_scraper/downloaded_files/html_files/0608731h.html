<p style="text-indent:0">POLITICS and book-learning is bad enough
took separate; together they're a blight and a curse. Take Yeller
Dog for a instance, a mining camp over in the Apache River country,
where I was rash enough to take up my abode in onst.</p>

<p>Yeller Dog was a decent camp till politics reared its head in
our midst and education come slithering after. The whiskey was good
and middling cheap. The poker and faro games was honest if you
watched the dealers clost. Three or four piddlin' fights a night
was the usual run, and a man hadn't been shot dead in more than a
week by my reckoning. Then, like my Aunt Tascosa Polk would say,
come the deluge.</p>

<p>It all begun when Forty-Rod Harrigan moved his gambling outfit
over to Alderville and left our one frame building vacant, and
Gooseneck Wilkerson got the idee of turning it into a city hall.
Then he said we ought to have a mayor to go with it, and announced
hisself as candidate. Naturally Bull Hawkins, our other leading
citizen, come out agen him. The election was sot for April 11.
Gooseneck established his campaign headquarters in the Silver
Saddle saloon, and Bull taken up his'n in the Red Tomahawk on
t'other side of the street. First thing we knowed, Yeller Dog was
in the grip of politics.</p>

<p>The campaign got under way, and the casualties was mounting
daily as public interest become more and more fatally aroused, and
on the afternoon of the 9th Gooseneck come into his headquarters,
and says: "We got to make a sweepin' offensive, boys. Bull Hawkins
is outgeneralin' us. That shootin' match he put on for a prime beef
steer yesterday made a big hit with the common herd. He's tryin' to
convince Yeller Dog that if elected he'd pervide the camp with more
high-class amusement than I could. Breck Elkins, will you pause in
yore guzzlin' and lissen here a minute? As chief of this here
political organization I demand yore attention!"</p>

<p>"I hear you," I says. "I was to the match, and they barred me on
a tecknicality, otherwise I would of won the whole steer. It warn't
so excitin', far as I could see. Only one man got shot."</p>

<p>"And he was one of my voters," scowled Gooseneck. "But we got to
outshine Bull's efforts to seduce the mob. He's resortin' to low,
onder-handed tactics by buyin' votes outright. I scorns sech
measures&mdash;anyway, I've bought all I'm able to pay for. We got
to put on a show which out-dazzles his dern' shootin' match."</p>

<p>"A rodeo, maybe," suggested Mule McGrath. "Or a good
dog-fight."</p>

<p>"Naw, naw," says Gooseneck. "My show will be a symbol of
progress and culture. We stages a spellin' match tomorrow night in
the city hall. Next mornin' when the polls opens the voters'll
still be so dazzled by the grandeur of our entertainment they'll
eleck me by a vast majority."</p>

<p>"How many men in this here camp can spell good enough to git
into a spellin' bee?" says I.</p>

<p>"I'm confident they's at least thirty-five men in this camp
which can read and write," says Gooseneck. "That's plenty. But we
got to find somebody to give out the words. It wouldn't look right
for me&mdash;it'd be beneath my offishul dignity. Who's educated
enough for the job?"</p>

<p>"I am!" says Jerry Brennon and Bill Garrison simultaneous. They
then showed their teeth at each other. They warn't friends
nohow.</p>

<p>"Cain't but one git the job," asserted Gooseneck. "I tests yore
ability. Can either one of you spell Constantinople?"</p>

<p>"K-o-n&mdash;" begun Garrison, and Brennon burst into a loud and
mocking guffaw, and said something pointed about ignoramuses.</p>

<p>"You $%#&amp;*!" says Garrison blood-thirstily.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen!" squawked Gooseneck&mdash;and then ducked as they
both went for their guns.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>They cleared leather about the same time. When the smoke oozed
away Gooseneck crawled out from under the roulette table and cussed
fervently.</p>

<p>"Two more reliable voters gone to glory!" he raged.
"Breckinridge, whyn't you stop 'em?"</p>

<p>"'T'warn't none of my business," says I, reaching for another
drink, because a stray bullet had knocked my glass out a my hand.
"Hey!" I addressed the barkeep sternly. "I see you fixin' to chalk
up that there spilt drink agen me. Charge it to Jerry Brennon. He
spilt it."</p>

<p>"Dead men pays no bills," complained the bartender.</p>

<p>"Cease them petty squabbles!" snarled Gooseneck. "You argys over
a glass of licker when I've jest lost two good votes! Drag 'em out,
boys," he ordered the other members of the organization which was
emerging from behind the bar and the whiskey barrels where they'd
took refuge when the shooting started. "Damn!" says Gooseneck with
bitterness. "This here is a deadly lick to my campaign! I not only
loses two more votes, but them was the best educated men in camp,
outside of me. Now who we goin' to git to conduck the spellin'
match?"</p>

<p>"Anybody which can read can do it," says Lobo Harrison a
hoss-thief with a mean face and a ingrown disposition. He'd go a
mile out of his way jest to kick a dog. "Even Elkins there could do
it."</p>

<p>"Yeah, if they was anything to read from," snorted Gooseneck.
"But they ain't a line of writin' in camp except on whiskey
bottles. We got to have a man with a lot of long words in his head.
Breckinridge, dammit, jest because I told the barkeep to charge
yore drinks onto campaign expenses ain't no reason for you to
freeze onto that bar permanent. Ride over to Alderville and git us
a educated man."</p>

<p>"How'll he know whether he's educated or not?" sneered Lobo,
which seemed to dislike me passionately for some reason or
another.</p>

<p>"Make him spell Constantinople," says Gooseneck.</p>

<p>"He cain't go over there," says Soapy Jackson. "The folks has
threatened to lynch him for cripplin' their sheriff."</p>

<p>"I didn't cripple their fool sheriff," I says indignantly. "He
crippled hisself fallin' through a wagon wheel when I give him a
kind of a push with a rock. How you spell that there Constance
Hopple word?"</p>

<p>Well, he spelt it thirty or forty times till I had it memorized,
so I rode over to Alderville. When I rode into town the folks
looked at me coldly and bunched up and whispered amongst
theirselves, but I paid no attention to 'em. I never seen the
deputy sheriff, unless that was him I seen climbing a white oak
tree as I hove in sight. I went into the White Eagle saloon and
drunk me a dram, and says to the barkeep: "Who's the best educated
man in Alderville?"</p>

<p>Says he: "Snake River Murgatroyd, which deals monte over to the
Elite Amusement Palace." So I went over there and jest as I went
through the door I happened to remember that Snake River had swore
he was going to shoot me on sight next time he seen me, account of
some trouble we'd had over a card game. But sech things is too
trivial to bother about. I went up to where he was setting dealing
monte, and I says: "Hey!"</p>

<p>"Place your bet," says he. Then he looked up and said: "You!
$#/0&amp;*@!" and reched for his gun, but I got mine out first and
shoved the muzzle under his nose.</p>

<p>"Spell Constantinople!" I tells him.</p>

<p>He turnt pale and said: "Are you crazy?"</p>

<p>"Spell it!" I roared, and he says: "C-o-n-s-t-a-n-t-i-n-o-p-l-e!
What the hell?"</p>

<p>"Good," I said, throwing his gun over in the corner out of
temptation's way. "We wants you to come over to Yeller Dog and give
out words at a spellin' match."</p>

<p>Everybody in the place was holding their breath. Snake River
moved his hands nervous-like and knocked a jack of diamonds off
onto the floor. He stooped like he was going to pick it up, but
instead he jerked a bowie out of his boot and tried to stab me in
the belly. Well, much as I would of enjoyed shooting him, I knowed
it would spile the spelling match, so merely taken the knife away
from him, and held him upside down to shake out whatever other
weppins he might have hid, and he begun to holler: "Help! Murder!
Elkins is killin' me!"</p>

<p>"It's a Yeller Dog plot!" somebody howled, and the next instant
the air was full of beer mugs and cuspidors. Some of them spittoons
was quite heavy, and when one missed me and went bong on Snake
River's head, he curled up like a angleworm which has been tromped
on.</p>

<p>"Lookit there!" they hollered, like it was my fault. "He's
tryin' to kill Snake River! Git him, boys!"</p>

<p>They then fell on me with billiard sticks and chair laigs in a
way which has made me suspicious of Alderville's hospitality ever
since.</p>

<p>Argyment being useless, I tucked Snake River under my left arm
and started knocking them fool critters right and left with my
right fist, and I reckon that was how the bar got wrecked. I never
seen a bar a man's head would go through easier'n that'n. So purty
soon the survivors abandoned the fray and run out of the door
hollering: "Help! Murder! Rise up, citizens! Yeller Dog is at our
throats! Rise and defend yore homes and loved ones!"</p>

<p>You would of thought the Apaches was burning the town, the way
folks was hollering and running for their guns and shooting at me,
as I clumb aboard Cap'n Kidd and headed for Yeller Dog. I left the
main road and headed through the bresh for a old trail I knowed
about, because I seen a whole army of men getting on their hosses
to lick out after me, and while I knowed they couldn't catch Cap'n
Kidd, I was a feared they might hit Snake River with a stray bullet
if they got within range. The bresh was purty thick and I reckon it
was the branches slapping him in the face which brung him to,
because all to onst he begun hollering blue murder.</p>

<p>"You ain't takin' me to Yeller Dog!" he yelled. "You're takin'
me out in the hills to murder me! Help! Help!"</p>

<p>"Aw, shet up," I snorted. "This here's a short cut."</p>

<p>"You can't get across Apache River unless you follow the road to
the bridge," says he.</p>

<p>"I can, too," I says. "We'll go acrost on the foot-bridge."</p>

<p>With that he give a scream of horror and a convulsive wrench
which tore hisself clean out of his shirt which I was holding onto.
The next thing I knowed all I had in my hand was a empty shirt and
he was on the ground and scuttling through the bushes. I taken in
after him, but he was purty tricky dodging around stumps and trees,
and I begun to believe I was going to have to shoot him in the hind
laig to catch him, when he made the mistake to trying to climb a
tree. I rode up onto him before he could get out of rech, and
reched up and got him by the laig and pulled him down, and his
langwidge was painful to hear.</p>

<p>It was his own fault he slipped outa my hand, he kicked so
vi'lent. I didn't go to drop him on his head.</p>

<p>But jest as I was reching down for him, I heard hosses running,
and looked up and here come that derned Alderville posse busting
through the bresh right on me. I'd lost so much time chasing Snake
River they'd catched up with me. So I scooped him up and hung him
over my saddle horn, because he was out cold, and headed for Apache
River. Cap'n Kidd drawed away from them hosses like they was
hobbled, so they warn't scarcely in pistol-range of us when we
busted out on the east bank. The river was up, jest a-foaming and
a-b'ling, and the footbridge warn't nothing only jest a log.</p>

<p>But Cap'n Kidd's sure-footed as a billy goat. We started acrost
it, and everything went all right till we got about the middle of
it, and then Snake River come to and seen the water booming along
under us. He lost his head and begun to struggle and kick and
holler, and his spurs scratched Cap'n Kidd's hide. That made Cap'n
Kidd mad, and he turnt his head and tried to bite my laig, because
he always blames me for everything that happens, and lost his
balance and fell off.</p>

<p>That would of been all right, too, because as we hit the water I
got hold of Cap'n Kidd's tail with one hand, and Snake River's
undershirt with the other'n, and Cap'n Kidd hit out for the west
bank. They is very few streams he cain't swim, flood or not. But
jest as we was nearly acrost the posse appeared on the hind bank
and started shooting at me, and they was apparently in some doubt
as to which head in the water was me, because some of 'em shot at
Snake River, too, jest to make sure. He opened his mouth to holler
at 'em, and got it full of water and dern near strangled.</p>

<p>Then all to onst somebody in the bresh on the west shore opened
up with a Winchester, and one of the posse hollered: "Look out,
boys! It's a trap! Elkins has led us into a ambush!"</p>

<p>They turnt around and high-tailed it for Alderville.</p>

<p>Well, what with the shooting and a gullet full of water, Snake
River was having a regular fit and he kicked and thrashed so he
kicked hisself clean out of his undershirt, and jest as my feet hit
bottom, he slipped out of my grip and went whirling off
downstream.</p>

<p>I jumped out on land, ignoring the hearty kick Cap'n Kidd
planted in my midriff, and grabbed my lariat off my saddle.
Gooseneck Wilkerson come prancing outa the bresh, waving a
Winchester and yelling: "Don't let him drownd, dang you! My whole
campaign depends on that spellin' bee! Do somethin'!"</p>

<p>I run along the bank and made a throw and looped Snake River
around the ears. It warn't a very good catch, but the best I could
do under the circumstances, and skin will always grow back onto a
man's ears.</p>

<p>I hauled him out of the river, and it was plumb ungrateful for
him to accuse me later of dragging him over them sharp rocks on
purpose. I like to know how he figgered I could rope him outa
Apache River without skinning him up a little. He'd swallered so
much water he was nigh at his last gasp. Gooseneck rolled him onto
his belly and jumped up and down on his back with both feet to git
the water out; Gooseneck said that was artifishul respiration, but
from the way Snake River hollered I don't believe it done him much
good.</p>

<p>Anyway, he choked up several gallons of water. When he was able
to threaten our lives betwixt cuss-words, Gooseneck says: "Git him
on yore hoss and le's git started. Mine run off when the shootin'
started. I jest suspected you'd be pursued by them dumb-wits and
would take the short-cut. That's why I come to meet you. Come on.
We got to git Snake River some medical attention. In his present
state he ain't in no shape to conduck no spellin' match."</p>

<p>Snake River was too groggy to set in the saddle, so we hung him
acrost it like a cow-hide over a fence, and started out, me leading
Cap'n Kidd. It makes Cap'n Kidd very mad to have anybody but me on
his back, so we hadn't went more'n a mile when he reched around and
sot his teeth in the seat of Snake River's pants. Snake River had
been groaning very weak and dismal and commanding us to stop and
let him down so's he could utter his last words, but when Cap'n
Kidd bit him he let out a remarkable strong yell and bust into
langwidge unfit for a dying man.</p>

<p>"$%/#&amp;!" quoth he passionately. "Why have <i>I</i> got to be
butchered for a Yeller Dog holiday?"</p>

<p>We was reasoning with him, when Old Man Jake Hanson hove out of
the bushes. Old Jake had a cabin a hundred yards back from the
trail. He was about the width of a barn door, and his whiskers was
marvelous to behold. "What's this ungodly noise about?" he
demanded. "Who's gittin' murdered?"</p>

<p>"I am!" says Snake River fiercely. "I'm bein' sacrificed to the
passions of the brutal mob!"</p>

<p>"You shet up," said Gooseneck severely. "Jake, this is the gent
we've consented to let conduck the spellin' match."</p>

<p>"Well, well!" says Jake, interested. "A educated man, hey? Why,
he don't look no different from us folks, if the blood war wiped
offa him. Say, lissen, boys, bring him over to my cabin! I'll dress
his wounds and feed him and take keer of him and git him to the
city hall tomorrer night in time for the spellin' match. In the
meantime he can teach my datter Salomey her letters."</p>

<p>"I refuse to tutor a dirty-faced cub&mdash;" began Snake River
when he seen a face peeking eagerly at us from the trees. "Who's
that?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"My datter Salomey," says Old Jake. "Nineteen her last birthday
and cain't neither read nor write. None of my folks ever could, far
back as family history goes, but I wants her to git some
education."</p>

<p>"It's a human obligation," says Snake River. "I'll do it!"</p>

<p>So we left him at Jake's cabin, propped up on a bunk, with
Salomey feeding him spoon-vittles and whiskey, and me and Gooseneck
headed for Yeller Dog, which warn't hardly a mile from there.</p>

<p>Gooseneck says to me: "We won't say nothin' about Snake River
bein' at Jake's shack. Bull Hawkins is sweet on Salomey and he's so
dern jealous-minded it makes him mad for another man to even stop
there to say hello to the folks. We don't want nothin' to interfere
with our show."</p>

<p>"You ack like you got a lot of confidence in it," I says.</p>

<p>"I banks on it heavy," says he. "It's a symbol of
civilization."</p>

<p>Well, jest as we come into town we met Mule McGrath with fire in
his eye and corn-juice on his breath. "Gooseneck, lissen!" says he.
"I jest got wind of a plot of Hawkins and Jack Clanton to git a lot
of our voters so drunk election day that they won't be able to git
to the polls. Le's call off the spellin' match and go over to the
Red Tomahawk and clean out that rat-nest!"</p>

<p>"Naw," says Gooseneck, "we promised the mob a show, and we keeps
our word. Don't worry; I'll think of a way to circumvent the
heathen."</p>

<p>Mule headed back for the Silver Saddle, shaking his head, and
Gooseneck sot down on the aidge of a hoss-trough and thunk deeply.
I'd begun to think he'd drapped off to sleep, when he riz up and
said: "Breck, git hold of Soapy Jackson and tell him to sneak out
of camp and stay hid till the mornin' of the eleventh. Then he's to
ride in jest before the polls open and spread the news that they
has been a big gold strike over in Wild Ross Gulch. A lot of
fellers will stampede for there without waitin' to vote. Meanwhile
you will have circulated amongst the men you know air goin' to vote
for me, and let 'em know we air goin' to work this campaign
strategy. With all my men in camp, and most of Bull's headin' for
Wild Ross Gulch, right and justice triumphs and I wins."</p>

<p>So I went and found Soapy and told him what Gooseneck said, and
on the strength of it he imejitly headed for the Silver Saddle, and
begun guzzling on campaign credit. I felt it was my duty to go
along with him and see that he didn't get so full he forgot what he
was supposed to do, and we was putting down the sixth dram apiece
when in come Jack McDonald, Jim Leary, and Tarantula Allison, all
Hawkins men. Soapy focused his wandering eyes on 'em, and says: "W-
who's this here clutterin' up the scenery? Whyn't you mavericks
stay over to the Red Tomahawk whar you belong?"</p>

<p>"It's a free country," asserted Jack McDonald. "What about this
here derned spellin' match Gooseneck's braggin' about all over
town?"</p>

<p>"Well, what about it?" I demanded, hitching my harness for'ard.
The political foe don't live which can beard a Elkins in his
lair.</p>

<p>"We demands to know who conducks it," stated Leary. "At least
half the men in camp eligible to compete is in our crowd. We
demands fair play!"</p>

<p>"We're bringin' in a cultured gent from another town," I says
coldly.</p>

<p>"Who?" demanded Allison.</p>

<p>"None of yore dang business!" trumpeted Soapy, which gets
delusions of valor when he's full of licker. "As a champion of
progress and civic pride I challenges the skunk-odored forces of
corrupt politics, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bam! McDonald swung with a billiard ball and Soapy kissed the
sawdust.</p>

<p>"Now look what you done," I says peevishly. "If you coyotes
cain't ack like gents, you'll oblige me by gittin' to hell outa
here."</p>

<p>"If you don't like our company suppose you tries to put us out!"
they challenged.</p>

<p>So when I'd finished my drink I taken their weppins away from
'em and throwed 'em headfirst out the side door. How was I to know
somebody had jest put up a new cast-iron hitching-rack out there?
Their friends carried 'em over to the Red Tomahawk to sew up their
sculps, and I went back into the Silver Saddle to see if Soapy had
come to yet. Jest as I reched the door he come weaving out,
muttering in his whiskers and waving his six-shooter.</p>

<p>"Do you remember what all I told you?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"S-some of it!" he goggled, with his glassy eyes wobbling in all
directions.</p>

<p>"Well, git goin' then," I urged, and helped him up onto his
hoss. He left town at full speed, with both feet outa the stirrups
and both arms around the hoss' neck.</p>

<p>"Drink is a curse and a delusion," I told the barkeep in
disgust. "Look at that sickenin' example and take warnin'! Gimme me
a bottle of rye."</p>

<p><br>
Well, Gooseneck done a good job of advertising the show. By the
middle of the next afternoon men was pouring into town from claims
all up and down the creek. Half an hour before the match was sot to
begin the hall was full. The benches was moved back from the front
part, leaving a space clear all the way acrost the hall. They had
been a lot of argyment about who was to compete, and who was to
choose sides, but when it was finally settled, as satisfactory as
anything ever was settled in Yeller Dog, they was twenty men to
compete, and Lobo Harrison and Jack Clanton was to choose up.</p>

<p>By a peculiar coincidence, half of that twenty men was
Gooseneck's, and half was Bull's. So naturally Lobo choosed his
pals, and Clanton chosed his'n.</p>

<p>"I don't like this," Gooseneck whispered to me. "I'd ruther
they'd been mixed up. This is beginnin' to look like a contest
between my gang and Bull's. If they win, it'll make me look cheap.
Where the hell is Snake River?"</p>

<p>"I ain't seen him," I said, "You ought to of made 'em take off
their guns."</p>

<p>"Shucks," says he. "What could possibly stir up trouble at sech
a lady-like affair as a spellin' bee. Dang it, where is Snake
River? Old Jake said he'd git him here on time."</p>

<p>"Hey, Gooseneck!" yelled Bull Hawkins from where he sot amongst
his coharts. "Why'n't you start the show?"</p>

<p>Bull was a big broad-shouldered hombre with black mustashes like
a walrus. The crowd begun to holler and cuss and stomp their feet
and this pleased Bull very much.</p>

<p>"Keep 'em amused," hissed Gooseneck. "I'll go look for Snake
River."</p>

<p>He snuck out a side door and I riz up and addressed the throng.
"Gents," I said, "be patient! They is a slight delay, but it won't
be long. Meantime I'll be glad to entertain you all to the best of
my ability. Would you like to hear me sing <i>Barbary
Allen</i>?"</p>

<p>"No, by grab!" they answered in one beller.</p>

<p>"Well, yo're a-goin' to!" I roared, infuriated by this callous
lack of the finer feelings. "I will now sing," I says, drawing my
.45s "and I blows the brains out of the first coyote which tries to
interrupt me."</p>

<p>I then sung my song without interference, and when I was through
I bowed and waited for the applause, but all I heard was Lobo
Harrison saying: "Imagine what the pore wolves on Bear Creek has to
put up with!"</p>

<p>This cut me to the quick, but before I could make a suitable
reply, Gooseneck slid in, breathing heavy. "I can't find Snake
River," he hissed. "But the bar-keep gimme a book he found
somewheres. Most of the leaves is tore out, but there's plenty
left. I've marked some of the longest words, Breck. You can read
good enough to give 'em out. You got to! If we don't start the show
right away, this mob'll wreck the place. Yo're the only man not in
the match which can even read a little, outside of me and Bull. It
wouldn't look right for me to do it, and I shore ain't goin' to let
Bull run my show."</p>

<p>I knew I was licked.</p>

<p>"Aw, well, all right," I said. "I might of knew I'd be the goat.
Gimme the book."</p>

<p>"Here it is," he said. "'The Adventures of a French Countess.'
Be dern shore you don't give out no words except them I
marked."</p>

<p>"Hey!" bawled Jack Clanton. "We're gittin' tired standin' up
here. Open the ball."</p>

<p>"All right," I says. "We commences."</p>

<p>"Hey!" said Bull. "Nobody told us Elkins was goin' to conduck
the ceremony. We was told a cultured gent from outa town was to do
it."</p>

<p>"Well," I says irritably, "Bear Creek is my home range, and I
reckon I'm as cultured as any snake-hunter here. If anybody thinks
he's better qualified than me, step up whilst I stomp his ears
off."</p>

<p>Nobody volunteered, so I says "All right. I tosses a dollar to
see who gits the first word." It fell for Harrison's gang, so I
looked in the book at the first word marked, and it was a gal's
name.</p>

<p>"Catharine," I says.</p>

<p>Nobody said nothing.</p>

<p>"Catharine!" I roared, glaring at Lobo Harrison.</p>

<p>"What you lookin' at me for?" he demanded. "I don't know no gal
by that name."</p>

<p>"%$&amp;*@!" I says with passion. "That's the word I give out.
Spell it, dammit!"</p>

<p>"Oh," says he. "All right. K-a-t-h-a-r-i-n-n."</p>

<p>"That's wrong," I says.</p>

<p>"What you mean wrong?" he roared. "That's right!"</p>

<p>"'Tain't accordin' to the book," I said.</p>

<p>"Dang the book," says he. "I knows my rights and I ain't to be
euchered by no ignorant grizzly from Bear Creek!"</p>

<p>"Who you callin' ignorant?" I demanded, stung, "Set down! You
spelt it wrong."</p>

<p>"You lie!" he howled, and went for his gun. But I fired
first.</p>

<p>When the smoke cleared away I seen everybody was on their feet
preparing for to stampede, sech as warn't trying to crawl under the
benches, so I said: "Set down, everybody. They ain't nothin' to git
excited about. The spellin' match continues&mdash;and I'll shoot
the first scoundrel which tries to leave the hall before the
entertainment's over."</p>

<p>Gooseneck hissed fiercely at me: "Dammit, be careful who you
shoot, cain't'cha? That was another one of my voters!"</p>

<p>"Drag him out!" I commanded, wiping off some blood where a slug
had notched my ear. "The spellin' match is ready to commence
again."</p>

<p>They was a kind of tension in the air, men shuffling their feet
and twisting their mustashes and hitching their gun-belts, but I
give no heed. I now approached the other side, with my hand on my
pistol, and says to Clanton: "Can you spell Catharine?"</p>

<p>"C-a-t-h-a-r-i-n-e!" says he.</p>

<p>"Right, by golly!" I says, consulting <i>The French
Countess</i>, and the audience cheered wildly and shot off their
pistols into the roof.</p>

<p>"Hey!" says Bill Stark, on the other side. "That's wrong. Make
him set down! It spells with a 'K'!"</p>

<p>"He spelt it jest like it is in the book," I says. "Look for
yoreself."</p>

<p>"I don't give a damn!" he yelled, rudely knocking The French
Countess outa my hand. "It's a misprint! It spells with a 'K' or
they'll be more blood on the floor! He spelt it wrong and if he
don't set down I shoots him down!"</p>

<p>"I'm runnin' this show!" I bellered, beginning to get mad. "You
got to shoot me before you shoots anybody else!"</p>

<p>"With pleasure!" snarled he, and went for his gun... Well, I hit
him on the jaw with my fist and he went to sleep amongst a wreckage
of busted benches. Gooseneck jumped up with a maddened shriek.</p>

<p>"Dang yore soul, Breckinridge!" he squalled. "Quit cancelin' my
votes! Who air you workin' for&mdash;me or Hawkins?"</p>

<p>"Haw! haw! haw!" bellered Hawkins. "Go on with the show! This is
the funniest thing I ever seen!"</p>

<p>Wham! The door crashed open and in pranced Old Jake Hanson,
waving a shotgun.</p>

<p>"Welcome to the festivities, Jake," I greeted him,
"Where's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You son of a skunk!" quoth he, and let go at me with both
barrels. The shot scattered remarkable. I didn't get more'n five or
six of 'em and the rest distributed freely amongst the crowd. You
ought to of heard 'em holler&mdash;the folks, I mean, not the
buckshot.</p>

<p>"What in tarnation air you doin'?" shrieked Gooseneck. "Where's
Snake River?"</p>

<p>"Gone!" howled Old Jake. "Run off! Eloped with my datter!"</p>

<p>Bull Hawkins riz with a howl of anguish, convulsively clutching
his whiskers.</p>

<p>"Salomey?" he bellered. "Eloped?"</p>

<p>"With a cussed gambolier they brung over from Alderville!"
bleated Old Jake, doing a war-dance in his passion. "Elkins and
Wilkerson persuaded me to take that snake into my boozum! In spite
of my pleas and protests they forced him into my peaceful $# %*
household, and he stole the pore, mutton-headed innercent's blasted
heart with his cultured airs and his slick talk! They've run off to
git married!"</p>

<p>"It's a political plot!" shrieked Hawkins, going for his gun,
"Wilkerson done it a-purpose!"</p>

<p>I shot the gun out of his hand, but Jack Clanton crashed a bench
down on Gooseneck's head and Gooseneck kissed the floor. Clanton
come down on top of him, out cold, as Mule McGrath swung with a
pistol butt, and the next instant somebody lammed Mule with a brick
bat and he flopped down acrost Clanton. And then the fight was on.
Them rival political factions jest kind of riz up and rolled
together in a wave of profanity, gun-smoke and splintering
benches.</p>

<p>I have always noticed that the best thing to do in sech cases is
to keep yore temper, and that's what I did for some time, in spite
of the efforts of nine or ten wild-eyed Hawkinites. I didn't even
shoot one of 'em; I kept my head and battered their skulls with a
joist I tore outa the floor, and when I knocked 'em down I didn't
stomp 'em hardly any. But they kept coming, and Jack McDonald was
obsessed with the notion that he could ride me to the floor by
jumping up astraddle of my neck. So he done it, and having
discovered his idee was a hallucination, he got a fistful of my
hair with his left, and started beating me in the head with his
pistol-barrel.</p>

<p>It was very annoying. Simultaneous, several other misfits got
hold of my laigs, trying to rassle me down, and some son of Baliol
stomped severely on my toe. I had bore my afflictions as patient as
Job up to that time, but this perfidy maddened me.</p>

<p>I give a roar which loosened the shingles on the roof, and
kicked the toe-stomper in the belly with sech fury that he curled
up on the floor with a holler groan and taken no more interest in
the proceedings. I likewise busted my timber on somebody's skull,
and reched up and pulled Jack McDonald off my neck like pulling a
tick off a bull's hide, and hev him through a convenient winder.
He's a liar when he says I aimed him deliberate at that rain
barrel. I didn't even know they was a rain barrel till I heard his
head crash through the staves. I then shaken nine or ten idjits
loose from my shoulders and shook the blood outa my eyes and
preceived that Gooseneck's men was getting the worst of it,
particularly including Gooseneck hisself. So I give another roar
and prepared to wade through them fool Hawkinites like a b'ar
through a pack of hound-dogs, when I discovered that some
perfidious side-winder had got my spur tangled in his whiskers.</p>

<p>I stooped to ontangle myself, jest as a charge of buckshot
ripped through the air where my head had been a instant before.
Three or four critters was rushing me with bowie knives, so I give
a wrench and tore loose by main force. How could I help it if most
of the whiskers come loose too? I grabbed me a bench to use for a
club, and I mowed the whole first rank down with one swipe, and
then as I drawed back for another lick, I heard somebody yelling
above the melee.</p>

<p><i>"Gold!"</i> he shrieked.</p>

<p>Everybody stopped like they was froze in their tracks. Even Bull
Hawkins shook the blood outa his eyes and glared up from where he
was kneeling on Gooseneck's wishbone with one hand in Gooseneck's
hair and a bowie in the other'n. Everybody quit fighting everybody
else, and looked at the door&mdash;and there was Soapy Jackson,
a-reeling and a-weaving with a empty bottle in one hand, and
hollering.</p>

<p>"Big gold strike in Wild Hoss Gulch," he blats. "Biggest the
West ever seen! Nuggets the size of osteridge
aigs&mdash;<i>gulp</i>!"</p>

<p>He disappeared in a wave of frenzied humanity as Yeller Dog's
population abandoned the fray and headed for the wide open spaces.
Even Hawkins ceased his efforts to sculp Gooseneck alive and j'ined
the stampede. They tore the whole front out of the city hall in
their flight, and even them which had been knocked stiff come to at
the howl of "Gold!" and staggered wildly after the mob, shrieking
pitifully for their picks, shovels and jackasses. When the dust had
settled and the thunder of boot-heels had faded in the distance,
the only human left in the city hall was me and Gooseneck, and
Soapy Jackson, which riz unsteadily with the prints of hob-nails
all over his homely face. They shore trompled him free and generous
in their rush.</p>

<p>Gooseneck staggered up, glared wildly about him, and went into
convulsions. At first he couldn't talk at all; he jest frothed at
the mouth. When he found speech his langwidge was shocking.</p>

<p>"What you spring it this time of night for?" he howled.
"Breckinridge, I said tell him to bring the news in the mornin',
not tonight!"</p>

<p>"I did tell him that," I says.</p>

<p>"Oh, so that was what I couldn't remember!" says Soapy. "That
lick McDonald gimme so plumb addled my brains I knowed they was
somethin' I forgot, but couldn't remember what it was."</p>

<p>"Oh sole mio!" gibbered Gooseneck, or words to that effeck.</p>

<p>"Well, what you kickin' about?" I demanded peevishly, having
jest discovered that somebody had stabbed me in the hind laig
during the melee. My boot was full of blood, and they was brand-new
boots. "It worked, didn't it?" I says. "They're all headin' for
Wild Hoss Gulch, includin' Hawkins hisself, and they cain't
possibly git back afore day after tomorrer."</p>

<p>"Yeah!" raved Gooseneck. "They're all gone, includin' my gang!
The damn camp's empty! How can I git elected with nobody here to
hold the election, and nobody to vote?"</p>

<p>"Oh," I says. "That's right. I hadn't thunk of that."</p>

<p>He fixed me with a awful eye.</p>

<p>"Did you," says he in a blood-curdling voice, "did you tell my
voters Soapy was goin' to enact a political strategy?"</p>

<p>"By golly!" I said. "You know it plumb slipped my mind! Ain't
that a joke on me?"</p>

<p>"Git out of my life!" says Gooseneck, drawing his gun.</p>

<p>That was a genteel way for him to ack, trying to shoot me after
all I'd did for him! I taken his gun away from him as gentle as I
knowed how and it was his own fault he got his arm broke. But to
hear him rave you would of thought he considered I was to blame for
his misfortunes or something. I was so derned disgusted I clumb
onto Cap'n Kidd and shaken the dust of that there camp offa my
boots, because I seen they was no gratitude in Yeller Dog.</p>

<p>I likewise seen I wasn't cut out for the skullduggery of
politics. I had me a notion one time that I'd make a hiyu sheriff
but I learnt my lesson. It's like my Pap says, I reckon.</p>

<p>"All the law a man needs," says he, "is a gun tucked into his
pants. And the main l'arnin' he needs is to know which end of that
gun the bullet comes out of."</p>

<p>What's good enough for Pap, gents, is good enough for me.</p>
