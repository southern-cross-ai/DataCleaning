<p style="text-indent:0">I WAS in Sundance enjoying myself a little
after a long trail-drive up from the Cimarron, when I got a letter
from Abednego Raxton which said as follers:</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Breckinridge:<br>
That time I paid yore fine down in Tucson for breaking the county
clerk's laig you said you'd gimme a hand anytime I ever need help.
Well Breckinridge I need yore assistance right now the rustlers is
stealing me ragged it has got so I nail my bed-kivers to the bunk
every night or they'd steal the blankets right offa me
Breckinridge. Moreover a stumbling block on the path of progress by
the name of Ted Bissett is running sheep on the range next to me
this is more'n a man can endure Breckinridge. So I want you to come
up here right away and help me find out who is stealing my stock
and bust Ted Bissett's hed for him the low-minded scunk. Hoping you
air the same I begs to remane as usual.<br>
Yore abused frend.<br>
Raxton, Esq.<br>
<br>
P. S. That sap-headed misfit Johnny Willoughby which used to work
for me down on Green River is sheriff here and he couldn't ketch
flies if they was bogged down in merlasses.</p>

<p>Well, I didn't feel it was none of my business to mix into any
row Abednego might be having with the sheepmen, so long as both
sides fit fair, but rustlers was a different matter. A Elkins
detests a thief. So I mounted Cap'n Kidd, after the usual battle,
and headed for Lonesome Lizard, which was the nighest town to his
ranch.</p>

<p>I found myself approaching this town a while before noon one
blazing hot day, and as I crossed a right thick timbered creek,
shrieks for aid and assistance suddenly bust the stillness. A hoss
also neighed wildly, and Cap'n Kidd begun to snort and champ like
he always does when they is a b'ar or a cougar in the vicinity. I
got off and tied him, because if I was going to have to fight some
critter like that, I didn't want him mixing into the scrap; he was
jest as likely to kick me as the varmint. I then went on foot in
the direction of the screams, which was growing more desperate
every minute, and I presently come to a thicket with a big tree in
the middle of it, and there they was. One of the purtiest gals I
ever seen was roosting in the tree and screeching blue murder, and
they was a cougar climbing up after her.</p>

<p>"Help!" says she wildly. "Shoot him!"</p>

<p>"I jest wish some of them tender-foots which calls theirselves
naturalists could see this," I says, taking off my Stetson. A
Elkins never forgits his manners. "Some of 'em has tried to tell me
cougars never attacks human beings nor climbs trees, nor prowls in
the daytime. I betcha this would make 'em realize they don't know
it all. Jest like I said to that'n which I seen in War Paint,
Nevada, last summer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you stop talkin' and do somethin'?" she says fiercely.
<i>"Ow!"</i></p>

<p>Because he had reched up and made a pass at her foot with his
left paw. I seen this had went far enough, so I told him sternly to
come down, but all he done was look down at me and spit in a very
insulting manner. So I reched up and got him by the tail and yanked
him down, and whapped him agen the ground three or four times, and
when I let go of him he run off a few yards, and looked back at me
in a most pecooliar manner. Then he shaken his head like he
couldn't believe it hisself, and lit a shuck as hard as he could
peel it in the general direction of the North Pole.</p>

<p>"Whyn't you shoot him?" demanded the gal, leaning as far out as
she could to watch him.</p>

<p>"Aw, he won't come back," I assured her. "Hey, look out! That
limb's goin' to break&mdash;"</p>

<p>Which it did jest as I spoke and she come tumbling down with a
shriek of despair. She still held onto the limb with a desperate
grip, however, which is why it rapped me so severe on the head when
I catched her.</p>

<p>"Oh!" says she, letting go of the limb and grabbing me. "Am I
hurt?"</p>

<p>"I dunno," I says, "You better let me carry you to wherever you
want to go."</p>

<p>"No," says she, gitting her breath back. "I'm all right. Lemme
down."</p>

<p>So I done so, and she says: "I got a hoss tied over there behind
that fir. I was ridin' home from Lonesome Lizard and stopped to
poke a squirrel out of a holler tree. It warn't a squirrel, though.
It was that dang lion. If you'll git my hoss for me, I'll be ridin'
home. Pap's ranch is jest over that ridge to the west. I'm Margaret
Brewster."</p>

<p>"I'm Breckinridge Elkins, of Bear Creek, Nevada," I says. "I'm
headin' for Lonesome Lizard, but I'll be ridin' back this way
before long. Can I call on you?"</p>

<p>"Well," she says, "I'm engaged to marry a feller, but it's
conditional. I got a suspicion he's a spineless failure, and I told
him flat if he didn't succeed at the job's he's workin' on now, not
to come back. I detests a failure. That's why I likes yore looks,"
says she, giving me a admiring glance. "A man which can rassle a
mountain lion with his b'ar hands is worth any gal's time. I'll
send you word at Lonesome Lizard; if my fiansay flops like it looks
he's goin' to do, I'd admire to have you call."</p>

<p>"I'll be awaitin' yore message with eager heart and honest
devotion," I says, and she blushed daintily and clumb on her hoss
and pulled her freight. I watched her till she was clean out of
sight, and then hove a sigh that shook the acorns out of the
surrounding oaks, and wended my way back to Cap'n Kidd in a sort of
rose-colored haze. I was so entranced I started to git onto Cap'n
Kidd on the wrong end and never noticed till he kicked me vi'lently
in the belly.</p>

<p>"Love, Cap'n Kidd," I says to him dreamily, batting him between
the eyes with my pistol butt, "is youth's sweet dream."</p>

<p>But he made no response, outside of stomping on my corns; Cap'n
Kidd has got very little sentiment.</p>

<p>So I mounted and pulled for Lonesome Lizard, which I arriv at
maybe a hour later. I put Cap'n Kidd in the strongest livery stable
I could find and seen he was fed and watered, and warned the
stable-hands not to antagonize him, and then I headed for the Red
Warrior saloon. I needed a little refreshments before I started for
Abednego's ranch.</p>

<p>I taken me a few drams and talked to the men which was
foregathered there, being mainly cowmen. The sheepmen patronized
the Bucking Ram, acrost the street. That was the first time I'd
ever been in Montana, and them fellers warn't familiar with my
repertation, as was showed by their manner.</p>

<p>Howthesomever, they was perlite enough, and after we'd downed a
few fingers of corn scrapings, one of 'em ast me where I was from,
proving they considered me a honest man with nothing to conceal.
When I told 'em, one of 'em said: "By golly, they must grow big men
in Nevada, if yo're a sample. Yo're the biggest critter I ever seen
in the shape of a human."</p>

<p>"I bet he's as stout as Big Jon," says one, and another'n says:
"That cain't be. This gent is human, after all. Big Jon ain't."</p>

<p>I was jest fixing to ast 'em who this Jon varmint was, when one
of 'em cranes his neck toward the winder and says: "Speak of the
devil and you gits a whiff of brimstone! Here comes Jon acrost the
street now. He must of seen this gent comin' in, and is on his way
to make his usual challenge. The sight of a man as big as him is
like wavin' a red flag at a bull."</p>

<p>I looked out the winder and seen a critter about the size of a
granary coming acrost the street from the Bucking Ram, follered by
a gang of men which looked like him, but not nigh as big.</p>

<p>"What kind of folks air they?" I ast with interest. "They ain't
neither Mexicans nor Injuns, but they sure ain't white men,
neither."</p>

<p>"Aw, they're Hunkies," says a little sawed-off cowman. "Ted
Bissett brung 'em in here to herd sheep for him. That big 'un's
Jon. He ain't got no sense, but you never seen sech a hunk of
muscle in yore life."</p>

<p>"Where they from?" I ast. "Canader?"</p>

<p>"Naw," says he. "They come originally from a place called
Yurrop. I dunno where I it is, but I jedge it's somewhere's east of
Chicago."</p>

<p>But I knowed them fellers never originated nowheres on this
continent. They was rough-dressed and wild-looking, with knives in
their belts, and they didn't look like no folks I'd ever saw
before. They come into the barroom and the one called Jon bristled
up to me very hostile with his little beady black eyes. He stuck
out his chest about a foot and hit it with his fist which was about
the size of a sledge hammer. It sounded like a man beating a bass
drum.</p>

<p>"You strong man," says he. "I strong too. We rassle, eh?"</p>

<p>"Naw," I says, "I don't care nothin' about rasslin'."</p>

<p>He give a snort which blowed the foam off of every beer glass on
the bar, and looked around till he seen a iron rod laying on the
floor. It looked like the handle of a branding iron, and was purty
thick. He grabbed this and bent it into a V, and throwed it down on
the bar in front of me, and all the other Hunkies jabbered
admiringly.</p>

<p>This childish display irritated me, but I controlled myself and
drunk another finger of whiskey, and the bartender whispered to me:
"Look out for him! He aims to prod you into a fight. He's nearly
kilt nine or ten men with his b'ar hands. He's a mean 'un."</p>

<p>"Well," I says, tossing a dollar onto the bar and turning away,
"I got more important things to do than rassle a outlandish
foreigner in a barroom. I got to eat my dinner and git out to the
Raxton ranch quick."</p>

<p>But at that moment Big Jon chose to open his bazoo. There are
some folks which cain't never let well enough alone.</p>

<p>"'Fraid!" jeered he. "Yah, yah!"</p>

<p>The Hunkies all whooped and guffawed, and the cattlemen
scowled.</p>

<p>"What you mean, afraid?" I gasped, more dumbfounded than mad.
It'd been so long since anybody's made a remark like that to me. I
was plumb flabbergasted. Then I remembered I was amongst strangers
which didn't know my repertation, and I realized it was my duty to
correct that there oversight before somebody got hurt on account of
ignorance.</p>

<p>So I said, "All right, you dumb foreign muttonhead, I'll rassle
you."</p>

<p>But as I went up to him, he doubled up his fist and hit me
severely on the nose, and them Hunkies all bust into loud, rude
laughter. That warn't wise. A man had better twist a striped
thunderbolt's tail than hit a Elkins onexpected on the nose. I give
a roar of irritation and grabbed Big Jon and started committing
mayhem on him free and enthusiastic. I swept all the glasses and
bottles off of the bar with him, and knocked down a hanging lamp
with him, and fanned the floor with him till he was limp, and then
I throwed him the full length of the barroom. His head went through
the panels of the back door, and the other Hunkies, which had stood
petrified, stampeded into the street with howls of horror. So I
taken the branding iron handle and straightened it out and bent it
around his neck, and twisted the ends together in a knot, so he had
to get a blacksmith to file it off after he come to, which was
several hours later.</p>

<p>All them cowmen was staring at me with their eyes popped out of
their heads, and seemed plumb incapable of speech, so I give a
snort of disgust at the whole incerdent, and strode off to git my
dinner. As I left I heard one feller, which was holding onto the
bar like he was too weak to stand alone, say feebly to the
dumb-founded bartender: "Gimme a drink, quick! I never thunk I'd
live to see somethin' I couldn't believe when I was lookin' right
smack at it."</p>

<p>I couldn't make no sense out of this, so I headed for the dining
room of the Montana Hotel and Bar. But my hopes of peace and quiet
was a illusion. I'd jest started on my fourth beefsteak when a big
maverick in Star-top boots and store-bought clothes come surging
into the dining room and bellered: "Is your name Elkins?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," I says. "But I ain't deef. You don't have to
yell."</p>

<p>"Well, what the hell do you mean by interferin' with my
business?" he squalled, ignoring my reproof.</p>

<p>"I dunno what yo're talkin' about," I growled, emptying the
sugar bowl into my coffee cup with some irritation. It looked like
Lonesome Lizard was full of maneyacks which craved destruction.
"Who air you, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"I'm Ted Bissett, that's who!" howled he, convulsively gesturing
toward his six-shooter. "And I'm onto you! You're a damn Nevada
gunman old Abed' Raxton's brought up here to run me off the range!
He's been braggin' about it all over town! And you starts your work
by runnin' off my sheepherders!"</p>

<p>"What you mean, I run yore sheepherders off?" I demanded,
amazed.</p>

<p>"They ran off after you maltreated Big Jon," he gnashed, with
his face convulsed. "They're so scared of you they won't come back
without double pay! You can't do this to me, you #$%&amp;*!"</p>

<p>The man don't live which can call me that name with impunity. I
impulsively hit him in the face with my fried steak, and he give a
impassioned shriek and pulled his gun. But some grease had got in
his eyes, so all he done with his first shot was bust the syrup
pitcher at my elbow, and before he could cock his gun again I shot
him through the arm. He dropped his gun and grabbed the place with
his other hand and made some remarks which ain't fitten for to
repeat.</p>

<p>I yelled for another steak, and Bissett yelled for a doctor, and
the manager yelled for the sheriff.</p>

<p>The last-named individual didn't git there till after the doctor
and the steak had arrove and was setting Bissett's arm&mdash;the
doctor, I mean, and not the steak, which a trembling waiter brung
me. Quite a crowd had gathered by this time and was watching the
doctor work with great interest, and offering advice which seemed
to infuriate Bissett, jedging from his langwidge. He also discussed
his busted arm with considerable passion, but the doctor warn't a
bit worried. You never seen sech a cheerful gent. He was jovial and
gay, no matter how loud Bissett yelled. You could tell right off he
was a man which could take it.</p>

<p>But Bissett's friends was very mad, and Jack Campbell, his
foreman, was muttering something about 'em taking the law into
their own hands, when the sheriff come prancing in, waving a
six-shooter and hollering: "Where is he? P'int out the scoundrel to
me?"</p>

<p>"There he is!" everybody yelled, and ducked, like they expected
gunplay, but I'd already recognized the sheriff, and when he seen
me he recoiled and shoved his gun out of sight like it was red hot
or something.</p>

<p>"Breckinridge Elkins!" says he. Then he stopped and studied a
while, and then he told 'em to take Bissett out to the bar and pour
some licker down him. When they'd went he sot down at the table,
and says: "Breck, I want you to understand that they ain't nothin'
personal about this, but I got to arrest you. It's agen the law to
shoot a man inside of the city limits."</p>

<p>"I ain't got time to git arrested," I told him. "I got to git
over to old Abed' Raxton's ranch."</p>

<p>"But lissen, Breck," argyed the sheriff&mdash;it was Johnny
Willoughby, jest like old Abed' said&mdash;"what'll folks think if
I don't jail you for shootin' a leadin' citizen? Election's comin'
up and my hat's in the ring," says he, gulping my coffee.</p>

<p>"Bissett shot at me first," I said. "Whyn't you arrest him?"</p>

<p>"Well, he didn't hit you," says Johnny, absently cramming half a
pie into his mouth and making a stab at my pertaters. "Anyway, he's
got a busted arm and ain't able to go to jail jest now. Besides, I
needs the sheepmen's votes."</p>

<p>"Aw, I don't like jails," I said irritably, and he begun to
weep.</p>

<p>"If you was a friend to me," sobs he, "you'd be glad to spend a
night in jail to help me git re-elected. I'd do as much for you!
The whole county's givin' me hell anyway, because I ain't been able
to catch none of them cattle rustlers, and if I don't arrest you I
won't have a Chinaman's chance at the polls. How can you do me like
this, after the times we had together in the old days&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw, stop blubberin'," I says. "You can arrest me, if you want
to. What's the fine?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to collect no fine, Breck," says he, wiping his
eyes on the oil-cloth table cover and filling his pockets with
doughnuts. "I figgers a jail sentence will give me more prestige.
I'll let you out first thing in the mornin'. You won't tear up the
jail, will you, Breck?"</p>

<p>I promised I wouldn't, and then he wants me to give up my guns,
and I refuses.</p>

<p>"But good gosh, Breck," he pleaded. "It'd look awful funny for a
prisoner to keep on his shootin' irons."</p>

<p>So I give 'em to him, jest to shet him up, and then he wanted to
put his handcuffs onto me, but they warn't big enough to fit my
wrists. So he said if I'd lend him some money he could have the
blacksmith to make me some laig- irons, but I refused profanely, so
he said all right, it was jest a suggestion, and no offense
intended, so we went down to the jail. The jailer was off sleeping
off a drunk somewheres, but he'd left the key hanging on the door,
so we went in. Purty soon along come Johnny's deperty, Bige Gantry,
a long, loose-j'inted cuss with a dangerous eye, so Johnny sent him
to the Red Warrior for a can of beer, and whilst he was gone Johnny
bragged on him a heap.</p>

<p>"Why," says he, "Bige is the only man in the county which has
ever got within' shootin' distance of them dern outlaws. He was by
hisself, wuss luck. If I'd been along we'd of scuppered the whole
gang."</p>

<p>I ast him if he had any idee who they was, and he said Bige
believed they was a gang up from Wyoming. So I said well, then, in
that case they got a hang-out in the hills somewheres, and ought to
be easier to run down than men which scattered to their homes after
each raid.</p>

<p>Bige got back with the beer about then, and Johnny told him that
when I got out of jail he was going to depertize me and we'd all go
after them outlaws together. So Bige said that was great, and
looked me over purty sharp, and we sot down and started playing
poker. Along about supper time the jailer come in, looking
tolerable seedy, and Johnny made him cook us some supper. Whilst we
was eating the jailer stuck his head into my cell and said: "A gent
is out there cravin' audience with Mister Elkins."</p>

<p>"Tell him the prisoner's busy," says Johnny.</p>

<p>"I done so," says the jailer, "and he says if you don't let him
in purty dern quick, he's goin' to bust in and cut <i>yore</i>
throat."</p>

<p>"That must be old Abed' Raxton," says Johnny. "Better let him
in&mdash;Breck," says he, "I looks to you to pertect me if the old
cuss gits mean."</p>

<p>So old Abed' come walzing into the jail with fire in his eye and
corn licker on his breath. At the sight of me he let out a squall
which was painful to hear.</p>

<p>"A hell of a help you be, you big lummox!" he hollered. "I sends
for you to help me bust up a gang of rustlers and sheepherders, and
the first thing you does is to git in jail!"</p>

<p>"T'warn't my fault," I says. "Them sheepherders started pickin'
on me."</p>

<p>"Well," he snarls, "whyn't you drill Bissett center when you was
at it?"</p>

<p>"I come up here to shoot rustlers, not sheepherders," I
says.</p>

<p>"What's the difference?" he snarled.</p>

<p>"Them sheepmen has probably got as much right on the range as
you cowmen," I says.</p>

<p>"Cease sech outrageous blasphermy," says he, shocked. "You've
bungled things so far, but they's one good thing&mdash;Bissett had
to hire back his derned Hunkie herders at double wages. He don't no
more mind spendin' money than he does spillin' his own blood, the
cussed tightwad. Well, what's yore fine?"</p>

<p>"Ain't no fine," I said. "Johnny wants me to stay in jail a
while."</p>

<p>At this old Abed' convulsively went for his gun and Johnny got
behind me and hollered: "Don't you dast shoot a ossifer of the
law!"</p>

<p>"It's a spite trick!" gibbered old Abed'. "He's been mad at me
ever since I fired him off'n my payroll. After I kicked him off'n
my ranch he run for sheriff, and the night of the election
everybody was so drunk they voted for him by mistake, or for a
joke, or somethin', and since he's been in office he's been lettin'
the sheepmen steal me right out of house and home."</p>

<p>"That's a lie," says Johnny heatedly. "I've give you as much
pertection as anybody else, you old buzzard! I jest ain't been able
to run any of them critters down, that's all. But you wait! Bige is
on their trail, and we'll have 'em behind the bars before the snow
falls."</p>

<p>"Before the snow falls in Guatemala, maybe," snorted old Abed'.
"All right, blast you, I'm goin', but I'll have Breckinridge outa
here if I have to burn the cussed jail! A Raxton never forgits!" So
he stalked out sulphurously, only turning back to snort: "Sheriff!
Bah! Seven murders in the county unsolved since you come into
office! You'll let the sheepmen murder us all in our beds! We ain't
had a hangin' since you was elected!"</p>

<p>After he'd left, Johnny brooded a while, and finally says: "The
old lobo's right about them murders, only he neglected to mention
that four of 'em was sheepmen. I know it's cattlemen and sheepmen
killin' each other, each side accusin' the other'n of rustlin'
stock, but I cain't prove nothin'. A hangin' <i>would</i> set me
solid with the voters." Here he eyed me hungrily, and ventured: "If
somebody'd jest up and confess to some of them murders&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You needn't to look at me like that," I says. "I never kilt
nobody in Montana."</p>

<p>"Well," he argyed, "nobody could <i>prove</i> you never done
'em, and after you was hanged&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lissen here, you," I says with some passion, "I'm willin' to
help a friend git elected all I can, but they's a limit!"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, all right," he sighed. "I didn't much figger you'd be
willin', anyway; folks is so dern selfish these days. All they
thinks about is theirselves. But lissen here: if I was to bust up a
lynchin' mob it'd be nigh as good a boost for my campaign as a
legal hangin'. I tell you what&mdash;tonight I'll have some of my
friends put on masks and come and take you out and pretend like
they was goin' to hang you. Then when they got the rope around yore
neck I'll run out and shoot in the air and they'll run off and I'll
git credit for upholdin' law and order. Folks always disapproves of
mobs, unless they happens to be in 'em."</p>

<p>So I said all right, and he urged me to be careful and not hurt
none of 'em, because they was all his friends and would be mine. I
ast him would they bust the door down, and he said they warn't no
use in damaging property like that; they could hold up the jailer
and take the key off'n him. So he went off to fix things, and after
while Bige Gantry left and said he was on the trace of a clue to
them cattle rustlers, and the jailer started drinking hair tonic
mixed with tequila, and in about a hour he was stiffer'n a wet
lariat.</p>

<p>Well, I laid down on the floor on a blanket to sleep, without
taking my boots off, and about midnight a gang of men in masks come
and they didn't have to hold up the jailer, because he was out
cold. So they taken the key off'n him, and all the loose change and
plug tobaccer out of his pockets too, and opened the door, and I
ast: "Air you the gents which is goin' to hang me?" And they says:
"We be!"</p>

<p>So I got up and ast them if they had any licker, and one of 'em
gimme a good snort out of his hip flask, and I said: "All right,
le's git it over with, so I can go back to sleep."</p>

<p>He was the only one which done any talking, and the rest didn't
say a word. I figgered they was bashful. He said: "Le's tie yore
hands behind you so's to make it look real," and I said all right,
and they tied me with some rawhide thongs which I reckon would of
held the average man all right.</p>

<p>So I went outside with 'em, and they was a oak tree right clost
to the jail nigh some bushes. I figgered Johnny was hiding over
behind them bushes.</p>

<p>They had a barrel for me to stand on, and I got onto it, and
they throwed a rope over a big limb and put the noose around my
neck, and the feller says: "Any last words?"</p>

<p>"Aw, hell," I says, "this is plumb silly. Ain't it about time
for Johnny&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment they kicked the barrel out from under me.</p>

<p>Well, I was kind of surprized, but I tensed my neck muscles, and
waited for Johnny to rush out and rescue me, but he didn't come,
and the noose began to pinch the back of my neck, so I got
disgusted and says: "Hey, lemme down!"</p>

<p>Then one of 'em which hadn't spoke before says: "By golly, I
never heard a man talk after he'd been strung up before!"</p>

<p>I recognized that voice; it was Jack Campbell, Bissett's
foreman! Well, I have got a quick mind, in spite of what my cousin
Bearfield Buckner says, so I knowed right off something was fishy
about this business. So I snapped the thongs on my wrists and
reched up and caught hold of the rope I was hung with by both hands
and broke it. Them scoundrels was so surprized they didn't think to
shoot at me till the rope was already broke, and then the bullets
all went over me as I fell. When they started shooting I knowed
they meant me no good, and acted according.</p>

<p>I dropped right in the midst of 'em, and brung three to the
ground with me, and during the few seconds to taken me to choke and
batter them unconscious the others was scairt to fire for fear of
hitting their friends, we was so tangled up. So they clustered
around and started beating me over the head with their gun butts,
and I riz up like a b'ar amongst a pack of hounds and grabbed four
more of 'em and hugged 'em till their ribs cracked. Their masks
came off during the process, revealing the faces of Bissett's
friends; I'd saw 'em in the hotel.</p>

<p>Somebody prodded me in the hind laig with a bowie at that
moment, which infuriated me, so I throwed them four amongst the
crowd and hit out right and left, knocking over a man or so at each
lick, till I seen a wagon spoke on the ground and stooped over to
pick it up. When I done that somebody throwed a coat over my head
and blinded me, and six or seven men then jumped onto my back.
About this time I stumbled over some feller which had been knocked
down, and fell onto my belly, and they all started jumping up and
down on me enthusiastically. I reched around and grabbed one and
dragged him around to where I could rech his left ear with my
teeth. I would of taken it clean off at the first snap, only I had
to bite through the coat which was over my head, but as it was I
done a good job, jedging from his awful shrieks.</p>

<p>He put forth a supreme effort and tore away, taking the coat
with him, and I shaken off the others and riz up in spite of their
puny efforts, with the wagon spoke in my hand.</p>

<p>A wagon spoke is a good, comforting implement to have in a
melee, and very demoralizing to the enemy. This'n busted all to
pieces about the fourth or fifth lick, but that was enough. Them
which was able to run had all took to their heels, leaving the
battlefield strewed with moaning and cussing figgers.</p>

<p>Their remarks was shocking to hear, but I give 'em no heed. I
headed for the sheriff's office, mad clean through. It was a few
hundred yards east of the jail, and jest as I rounded the jail
house, I run smack into a dim figger which come sneaking through
the bresh making a curious clanking noise. It hit me with what
appeared to be a iron bar, so I went to the ground with it and
choked it and beat its head agen the ground, till the moon come out
from behind a cloud and revealed the bewhiskered features of old
Abednego Raxton!</p>

<p>"What the hell?" I demanded of the universe at large. "Is
everybody in Montaner crazy? Whar air <i>you</i> doin' tryin' to
murder me in my sleep?"</p>

<p>"I warn't, you jack-eared lunkhead," snarled he, when he could
talk.</p>

<p>"Then what'd you hit me with that there pinch bar for?" I
demanded.</p>

<p>"I didn't know it was you," says he, gitting up and dusting his
britches. "I thought it was a grizzly b'ar when you riz up out of
the dark. Did you bust out?"</p>

<p>"Naw, I never," I said. "I told you I was stayin' in jail to do
Johnny a favor. And you know what that son of Baliol done? He
framed it up with Bissett's friends to git me hung. Come on. I'm
goin' over and interview the dern skunk right now."</p>

<p>So we went over to Johnny's office, and the door was unlocked
and a candle burning, but he warn't in sight.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>They was a small iron safe there, which I figgered he had my
guns locked up in, so I got a rock and busted it open, and sure
enough there my shooting- irons was. They was also a gallon of corn
licker there, and me and Abed' was discussing whether or not we had
the moral right to drink it, when I heard somebody remark in a
muffled voice: "Whumpff! Gfuph! <i>Oompg!</i>"</p>

<p>So we looked around and I seen a pair of spurs sticking out from
under a camp cot over in the corner. I grabbed hold of the boots
they was on, and pulled 'em out, and a human figger come with 'em.
It was Johnny. He was tied hand and foot and gagged, and he had a
lump onto his head about the size of a turkey aig.</p>

<p>I pulled off the gag, and the first thing he says was: "If you
sons of Perdition drinks my private licker I'll have yore hearts'
blood!"</p>

<p>"You better do some explainin'," I says resentfully. "What you
mean, siccin' Bissett's friends onto me?"</p>

<p>"I never done no sech!" says he heatedly. "Right after I left
the jail I come to the office here, and was jest fixin' to git hold
of my friends to frame the fake necktie party, when somebody come
in at the door and hit me over the head. I thought it was Bige
comin' in and didn't look around, and then whoever it was clouted
me. I jest while ago come to myself, and I was tied up like you
see."</p>

<p>"If he's tellin' the truth," says old Abed' "&mdash;which he
seems to be, much as I hates to admit it&mdash;it looks like some
friend of Bissett's overheard you all talkin' about this thing,
follered Johnny over and put him out of the way for the time bein',
and then raised a mob of his own, knowin' Breck wouldn't put up no
resistance, thinkin' they was friends. I told you&mdash;who's
that?"</p>

<p>We all drawed our irons, and then put 'em up as Bige Gantry
rushed in, holding onto the side of his head, which was all
bloody.</p>

<p>"I jest had a bresh with the outlaws!" he hollered. "I been
trailin' 'em all night! They waylaid me while ago, three miles out
of town! They nearly shot my ear off! But if I didn't wing one of
'em, I'm a Dutchman!"</p>

<p>"Round up a posse!" howled Johnny, grabbing a Winchester and
cartridge belt. "Take us back to where you had the scrape,
Bige&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," I says, grabbing Bige. "Lemme see that ear!" I
jerked his hand away, disregarding the spur he stuck into my laig,
and bellered: "Shot, hell! That ear was chawed, and I'm the man
which done it! You was one of them illegitimates which tried to
hang me!"</p>

<p>He then whipped out his gun, but I knocked it out of his hand
and hit him on the jaw and knocked him through the door. I then
follered him outside and taken away the bowie he drawed as he rose
groggily, and throwed him back into the office, and went in and
throwed him out again, and went out and throwed him back in
again.</p>

<p>"How long is this goin' on?" he ast.</p>

<p>"Probably all night," I assured him. "The way I feel right now I
can keep heavin' you in and out of this office from now till noon
tomorrer."</p>

<p>"Hold up!" gurgled he. "I'm a hard nut, but I know when I'm
licked! I'll confess! I done it!"</p>

<p>"Done what?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"I hit Johnny on the head and tied him up!" he howled, grabbing
wildly for the door jamb as he went past it. "I rigged the lynchin'
party! I'm in with the rustlers!"</p>

<p>"Set him down!" hollered Abed', grabbing holt of my shirt.
"Quick, Johnny! Help me hold Breckinridge before he kills a
valurebull witness!"</p>

<p>But I shaken him off impatiently and sot Gantry onto his feet.
He couldn't stand, so I helt him up by the collar and he gasped: "I
lied about tradin' shots with the outlaws. I been foolin' Johnny
all along. The rustlers ain't no Wyoming gang; they all live around
here. Ted Bissett is the head chief of 'em&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ted Bissett, hey?" whooped Abed', doing a war-dance and kicking
my shins in his glee. "See there, you big lummox? What'd I tell
you? What you think now, after showin' so dern much affection for
them cussed sheepmen? Jest shootin' Bissett in the arm, like he was
yore brother, or somethin'! S'wonder you didn't invite him out to
dinner. You ain't got the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw, shet up!" I said fretfully. "Go on, Gantry."</p>

<p>"He ain't a legitimate sheepman," says he. "That's jest a blind,
him runnin' sheep. Ain't no real sheepmen mixed up with him. His
gang is jest the scrapin's of the country, and they hide out on his
ranch when things gits hot. Other times they scatters and goes
home. They're the ones which has been killin' honest sheepman and
cattlemen&mdash;tryin' to set the different factions agen each
other, so as to make stealin' easier. The Hunkies ain't in on the
deal. He jest brung 'em out to herd his sheep, because his own men
wouldn't do it, and he was afeared if he hired local sheepherders,
they'd ketch onto him. Naturally we wanted you outa the way, when
we knowed you'd come up here to run down the rustlers, so tonight I
seen my chance when Johnny started talkin' about stagin' that fake
hangin'. I follered Johnny and tapped him on the head and tied him
up and went and told Bissett about the business, and we got the
boys together, and you know the rest. It was a peach of a frame-up,
and it'd of worked, too, if we'd been dealing with a human bein'.
Lock me up. All I want right now is a good, quiet penitentiary
where I'll be safe."</p>

<p>"Well," I said to Johnny, after he'd locked Gantry up, "all you
got to do is ride over to Bissett's ranch and arrest him. He's laid
up with his arm, and most of his men is crippled. You'll find a
number of 'em over by the jail. This oughta elect you."</p>

<p>"It will!" says he, doing a war-dance in his glee. "I'm as good
as elected right now! And I tell you, Breck, t'ain't the job alone
I'm thinkin' about. I'd of lost my gal if I'd lost the race. But
she's promised to marry me if I ketched them rustlers and got
re-elected. And she won't go back on her word, neither!"</p>

<p>"Yeah?" I says with idle interest, thinking of my own true love.
"What's her name?"</p>

<p>"Margaret Brewster!" says he.</p>

<p><i>"What?"</i> I yelled, in a voice which knocked old Abed' over
on his back like he'd been hit by a cyclone. Them which accuses me
of vi'lent and onusual conduck don't consider how my emotions was
stirred up by the knowledge that I had went through all them
humiliating experiences jest to help a rival take my gal away from
me. Throwing Johnny through the office winder and kicking the walls
out of the building was jest a mild expression of the way I felt
about the whole dern affair, and instead of feeling resentful, he
ought to have been thankful I was able to restrain my natural
feelings as well as I done.</p>
