<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">I WAS ready for trouble. Canton's narrow
waterfront streets were still and shadowy in that hour before dawn
when I left the docks. The guttering street lamps gave little
light. My bulldog, Bill, bristled suddenly and began to rumble in
his throat. There was a rattle of feet on the cobblestones down an
alley to the right. Then the sound of a heavy fall, scuffling, a
strangled scream.</p>

<p>Plainly it was none of my business. But I quickened my pace and
dashing around the corner, nearly fell over a writhing, struggling
mass on the cobblestones. The dim light of a street lamp showed me
what was going on. Two men fought there in deadly silence. One was
a slim young Chinese in European clothes. Down on his back in the
muck, he was. Kneeling on his chest was a slant-eyed devil in
native riggings. He was big and lean, with a face like a Taoist
devil-mask. With one talon-like hand, he clutched the throat of the
smaller man. A knife flashed in his other hand.</p>

<p>I recognized him for what he was&mdash;one of the bloody
hatchet-men the big tongs and secret societies use for their dirty
work. I followed my natural instinct and knocked him senseless with
a smashing right hook behind the ear. He stretched out without a
twitch and the young Chinese sprang up, gasping and wild eyed.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my friend," he gurgled in perfect English. "I owe my
life to you. Here, take this..." And he tried to stuff a wad of
banknotes into my hand.</p>

<p>I drew back. "You owe me nothing," I growled. "I'd have done as
much for any man."</p>

<p>"Then please accept my humble and sincere thanks," he exclaimed,
seizing my hand. "You are an American, are you not? What is your
name?"</p>

<p>"I'm Steve Costigan, first mate of the trading vessel
<i>Panther</i>," I answered.</p>

<p>"I will not forget," he said. "I will repay you some day, as my
name is Yotai T'sao. But now I must not linger. This is my one
chance of escape. If I can get aboard the English ship that is
anchored in the bay, I am safe. But I must go before this beast
comes to. Best that you go too. May fortune attend you. But beware
of the Yo Thans."</p>

<p>The next instant he was racing down the street at full speed.
Watching him in amazement, I saw him sprint onto the docks and dive
off, without the slightest pause. I heard the splash as he hit and
a little later I saw, in the growing gray light, a widening ripple
aiming toward the British <i>S.S. Marquis,</i> which lay out in the
bay. I left off wondering what it could mean, when the hatchet-man
scrambled uncertainly to his feet. More or less ironically, I said:
"Well, my bully boy, give me the low-down on this business, will
you?"</p>

<p>His answer was a look of such diabolic hatred as to almost send
cold shivers down my spine. He limped away into the shadows. I
dismissed the whole affair from my mind and went on down the
street.</p>

<p>About sun-up I decided I would get a little sleep in preparation
for the day. It was my first shore leave in weeks, and I was
determined to make the most of it. I turned into a seamen's
boarding house kept by a Eurasian called Diego, got a room and
turned in.</p>

<p>I was wakened by Bill's growling. He was clawing at the locked
door and looking up at the transom, which was open. Then I saw
something lying on my chest&mdash;a piece of stiff paper, rolled
into a dart-shaped wad. I unrolled it, but there were no words on
it, either English or Chinese, just a picture portraying a coiled
snake, somewhat resembling a cobra. That was all.</p>

<p>Somewhat puzzled, I rose and dressed and shouted for Diego. When
he came I said: "Look, Diego. Someone threw this through the
transom onto my chest. Do you know what the meaning of it is."</p>

<p>He took a single look. Then he leaped back with a shriek: "Yo
Than. Death. It's the murder sign of the Yo Thans."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I growled. "Who are these Yo Thans?"</p>

<p>"A Chinese secret society," gasped Diego, white and shaking like
a leaf. "International criminals&mdash;murderers. Three times have
I seen men receive the sign of the snake. Each time he who received
it dies before the sun rose again. Get back to your ship. Hide,
stay aboard until she sails. Maybe you can escape."</p>

<p>"Skulk aboard my ship like a cringing rat?" I growled. "I, who
am known as a fighting man in every Asiatic port? I've never run or
hidden from any man yet. Tell me, who is Yotai T'sao?"</p>

<p>But Diego was gripped by the yellow hand of fear.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you nothing," he screamed. "I'm risking my life
talking to you. Get out, quick. You mustn't stay here. I can't have
another murder in my house. Go, please, Steve."</p>

<p>"All right," I snapped. "Don't burst a blood-vessel, Diego. I'm
going."</p>

<p>In disgust, I stalked forth in quest of food. While I ate and
Bill had his scoffings from a panikin on the floor, I reviewed the
situation and had the uncomfortable feeling that I had somehow
blundered into the affairs of some mysterious gang of Oriental
cut-throats. Under the bland outer surface of the Orient run dark
and mysterious currents of plot and intrigue, unknown to white
men&mdash;unless one unluckily goes beyond his depth in native
affairs and is caught by some such deadly undertow.</p>

<p>In that case... Well, it is no uncommon thing for a white man to
disappear, to simply vanish as into thin air. Perhaps he is never
heard of again. Perhaps his knife-riddled body is found floating in
the river, or cast up on the beach. In either event, only silence
rewards investigations. China never speaks. Like a vast, sleeping
yellow giant she preserves her ancient and mysterious silence
inviolate.</p>

<p>Finishing my meal, I sauntered out into the streets again, with
their filth and glamor, sordidity and allure going hand in hand;
throngs of Orientals buying and selling, bargaining in their
monotonous sing-song, sailors of all nations rolling through the
crowds...</p>

<p>I began to have a queer feeling that I was being followed. Again
and again I wheeled quickly and scanned the crowd, but in that
teeming swarm of yellow slant-eyed faces it was impossible to tell
whether anyone was trailing me. Yet the sensation persisted.</p>

<p>As the day wore on I found myself in Froggy Ladeau's American
Bar, at the edge of the waterfront district. There I spied a man I
knew&mdash;an Englishman named Wells, who had some sort of a
government job. I sat down at his table. "Wells," I said, "did you
ever hear of a man named Yotai T'sao?"</p>

<p>"That I have," he answered. "But I fear the blighter's been
potted off. He's been working with the government trying to get
evidence against a certain gang of dangerous criminals and last
night he disappeared."</p>

<p>"He's all right," I replied. "I saw him swim out to an English
ship which weighed anchor shortly after sun-up. But who are these
criminals?"</p>

<p>"Bad blokes," said Wells, taking a long swig of ale. "An
organized society. It's rumored their chief is a coral button
mandarin. They specialize in murder and blackmail, to say nothing
of smuggling, gun-running and jewel-stealing. Of late they've been
tampering with bigger things&mdash;governmental secrets. The Yo
Thans, they're called. The government would jolly well like to lay
hands on them. But you've no idea what snaky customers they are.
They're here, there and everywhere. We know they exist, but we
can't nab the beggars. If the natives would talk&mdash;but they
won't, and there's China for you. Even victims of the society won't
blab. So what can we do?</p>

<p>"But the government has gotten a promise of assistance from the
most Honorable and Eminent Yun Lai Kao. You've heard of him?"</p>

<p>"Sure," I nodded. "Sort of a wealthy Oriental recluse and
philanthropist, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"That and more. The natives look on him as a sort of god. He has
almost unbelievable power in Canton, though he's never bothered to
wield it very much. He's a philosopher&mdash;too busy considering
abstract ideals and principles to bother with material things. He
seldom ever appears in public. It was the very deuce to get him
interested enough in sordid reality to promise to help the
government scotch a gang of thugs. That shows, too, how helpless
the government really is in this matter, when it has to call on
private individuals. The only argument that moved him was the
assurance that the Yo Thans are swiftly assuming a political
importance, and were likely to start a civil war in China."</p>

<p>"Is it that important?" I asked, startled.</p>

<p>"Believe me, it is. These things grow fast. The unknown power,
the nameless man, directing the activities of these thugs, is
ruthless and clever as the devil, quite capable of raising the red
flag of anarchy if he gets a little more power. China is a powder
keg, ready for some unscrupulous rogue to set it off. No
conservative Chinese wants that to happen. That's why Yun Lai Kao
agreed to help. And with his power over the natives, I believe the
government will lay the Yo Thans by the heels."</p>

<p>"What sort of a man is this mandarin, Yun Lai Kao?" I asked. "A
venerable, white bearded patriarch, with ten-inch finger nails
encased in gold and a load of Confucian epigrams?"</p>

<p>"Not by a long shot," answered Wells. "He doesn't look the type
of a mystic at all. A clean-cut chap in middle life, he is, with a
firm jaw and gimlet eyes&mdash;a graduate from Oxford too, by the
way. Should have been a scientist or a soldier. Some queer quirk in
his Oriental mind turned him to philosophy."</p>

<p>A commotion burst out in the bar. Ladeau was having some kind of
a row with a big sailor. Suddenly the sailor hauled off and hit
Froggy between the eyes. Ladeau crashed down on a table, with beer
mugs and seltzer water bottles spilling all over him, and began
yelling for Big John Clancy, his American bouncer. Hearing this,
the sailor took to his heels. But Ladeau, floundering around in the
ruins of the table with his eyes still full of stars, didn't see
that. Big John came barging in and Froggy yelled: "Throw him out!
Beat him up! Give him the bum's rush! Out with him, John!"</p>

<p>"Out with who?" roared Clancy, glaring around and doubling up
his huge fists.</p>

<p>"That blasted sailor," bawled Froggy. Clancy then made a natural
mistake. As it happened, I was the only sailor in the bar. I had
just turned back to speak to Wells, when to my outraged amazement,
I felt myself gripped by what appeared to be a gorilla.</p>

<p>"Out with you, my bully," growled Big John, hauling me out of my
chair and trying to twist me around and get a hammerlock on my
right arm.</p>

<p>I might have explained the situation, but my nerves were on edge
already. And being mate on a tough tramp trader makes a man handier
with his fists than with his tongue. I acted without conscious
thought and jolted him loose from me with a left hook under the
heart that nearly upset him. It would have finished an ordinary
man, but Big John was built like a battleship. He gave a deafening
roar and plunged headlong on me, locking both of his mighty arms
around me. We went to the floor together, smashing a few chairs in
our fall. As we cursed and wrestled, his superior weight enabled
him to get on top of me.</p>

<p>At that instant my bulldog Bill landed square between Clancy's
shoulders. By some chance his jaws missed Big John's bull neck, but
ripped out the whole back of his coat. Big John gave a yell of
fright and with a desperate heave of his enormous shoulders, shook
Bill off and jumped up. I arose, too, and caught Bill just as he
was soaring for Clancy's throat. I pushed him back, ordering him to
keep out of it, and then turned toward Big John, who was snorting
and blowing like a grampus in his wrath.</p>

<p>I was seeing red myself.</p>

<p>"Come on, you son-of-a-seahorse," I snarled. "If it's fighting
you want, I'll give you a belly-full."</p>

<p>At that he gave a terrible howl and came for me, crazy-eyed.
Ladeau ran between us, dancing and howling like a burnt cat.</p>

<p>"Git away, Froggy," bellowed Big John, swinging his huge arms
like windmills. "Git outa the way! I'm goin' to smear this
salt-water tramp all over the joint."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, please, John," screamed Ladeau, pushing against
Clancy's broad chest with both hands. "This here is Steve Costigan
of the <i>Panther.</i>"</p>

<p>"What do I care who he is?" roared Big John. "Git outa the
way!"</p>

<p>"You can't fight in here," Froggy howled desperately. "If you
two tangles here, you'll tear the joint down. I can't afford it.
Anyway, he ain't the man that hit me."</p>

<p>"Well, he's the swine that hit me," rumbled Big John.</p>

<p>"Get aside, Froggy," I snapped. "Let us have it out. It's the
only way."</p>

<p>"No, no!" shrieked Ladeau. "It cost me five hundred dollars to
repair the place after you throwed Red McCoy out, John, and I seen
Costigan lick Bully Dawson in a saloon in Hong Kong. They had to
rebuild the joint. Come down on the beach, back of the Kago Tong
warehouses and fight it out where you can't bust nothin' but each
others' noses."</p>

<p>"A jolly good idea," put in Wells. "You fellows don't want to
make a spectacle of yourselves here, in a respectable district, and
have the police on you. If you must fight, why don't you do as
Ladeau says?"</p>

<p>Big John folded his mighty arms and glared at me, as he growled:
"Fair enough. I ain't the man to do useless damage. I'll be at the
beach as quick as I can get there. Get some of your crew, Costigan,
so as to have fair play all around. And get there as soon as you
can."</p>

<p>"Good enough," I snapped. Turning on my heel, I left the bar.
Oh, it seems foolish, no doubt, grown men fighting like school
boys. But reputations grow. A man in the ordinary course of duty
acquires the name of a fighter and before he knows it, his pride is
forcing him into fights to maintain it.</p>

<p>Hoping to find some of the <i>Panther's</i> crew, I went down
the narrow waterfront streets. My efforts met with no success. As a
last resort, I thought of a shop down a little side street in the
native quarter, run by a Chinese named Yuen Lao, who sells trinkets
such as sailors buy in foreign ports to give to their
sweethearts.</p>

<p>With the thought that I might find some of my friends there, I
turned into the obscure, winding street. I noticed that there were
even fewer people traversing it than usual. An old man with a cage
full of canary birds, a coolie pulling a cart, a fish peddler or
so&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>I saw the shop just ahead of me. Then, with a vicious
<i>zing</i>&mdash;something came humming through the air. It hissed
by my neck as I instinctively ducked. It thudded into the wall at
my shoulder&mdash;a long thin bladed knife, stuck a good three
inches into the hard boards and quivering from the force of the
throw. Had it hit me, it would have gone clear through me.</p>

<p>I looked across the street, but all I could see was the blank
fronts of a row of vacant shops. The windows all seemed to be
boarded up, but I knew that the knife had come from one of them.
The Chinese on the street paid no attention to me at all. They went
about their affairs as if they seen nothing, not even me. Little
use to ask them if they saw the knife-thrower. China never
speaks.</p>

<p>And the thought of the Yo Thans came back to me with a shudder.
It had been no idle threat, that cryptic sign of the snake. They
had struck and missed, but they would strike again and again until
they opened the Doors of Doom for Steve Costigan. Cold sweat broke
out on me. This was like fighting a cobra in the dark.</p>

<p>I turned into Yuen Lao's shop, with its shelves of jade idols,
coral jewelry and tiny ivory elephants. A bronze Buddha squatted on
a raised dais, its inscrutable face veiled by the smoke of burning
joss sticks. Only Yuen Lao, tall and lean, with a mask-like face,
stood in the shop.</p>

<p>I turned to leave, when he came quickly from behind his
counter.</p>

<p>"You are Costigan, mate of the <i>Panther</i>?" said he in good
English. I nodded, and he continued in a lowered voice. "You are in
danger. Do not ask me how I know. These things have a way of
getting about among the Chinese. Listen to me. I would be your
friend. And you need friends. Without my aid, you will be dead
before dawn."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," I growled, involuntarily tensing my biceps.
"I've never been in a jamb yet that I couldn't slug my way out
of."</p>

<p>"Your strength will not help you." He shook his head. "Your
shipmates cannot aid you. Your enemies will strike secretly and
subtly. Their sign is the cobra. And, like the cobra, they kill
swiftly, silently, giving their victim no chance to defend
himself."</p>

<p>I began to feel wild and desperate, like a wolf in a trap, as
the truth of his words came home to me.</p>

<p>"How am I going to fight men who won't come into the open?" I
snarled, helplessly, knotting my fists until the knuckles showed
white. "Get them in front of me and I'll battle the whole gang. But
I can't smoke them out of their hives."</p>

<p>"You must listen to me," said Yuen Lao. "I will save you. I have
no cause to love the Yo Thans."</p>

<p>"But why have they turned on me?" I asked in perplexity.</p>

<p>"You prevented their chief hatchet-man from slaying Yotai
T'sao," said he. "Yotai T'sao was doomed, tried and sentenced by
their most dread tribunal. He had intrigued his way into their
secret meeting places and councils, to get evidence to use against
them in the court. For he was a spy of the government. His life was
forfeit and not even the government could save him from the
vengeance of the Yo Thans. Last night he sought to escape and was
trapped by Yaga, the hatchet-man who hunted him down and caught him
almost on the wharves. There had Yotai T'sao died but for you.
Today he is far at sea and safe. But the vengeance of the Yo Thans
is turned upon you. And you are doomed."</p>

<p>"A nice mess," I muttered.</p>

<p>"But I am your friend," continued Yuen Lao. "And I hate the Yo
Thans. I am more than I seem."</p>

<p>"Are you a government spy too?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Shh!" He laid his long finger to his lips and glanced around
quickly and warily. "The very walls have ears in Canton. But I will
tell you this. There is but one man in Canton who can save you, who
will, if I ask him, speak the word that will make even the Yo Thans
stay their hands."</p>

<p>"Yun Lai Kao," I muttered.</p>

<p>Yuen Lao started and peered at me intensely for an instant. Then
he seemed to nod, almost imperceptibly.</p>

<p>"Tonight I will take you to&mdash;this&mdash;this man. Let him
remain nameless, for the present. You must come alone, hinting your
errand to no one. Trust me!"</p>

<p>"It's not many hours till sundown," I muttered. "When and where
shall I meet you?"</p>

<p>"Come to me alone, in the Alley of Bats, as soon as it is well
dark. And go now, quickly. We must not be seen too much together.
And be wary, lest the Yo Thans strike again before we meet."</p>

<p>As I left the shop I had a distinct feeling of relief. I had not
been inclined to trust Yuen Lao's mere word, but his evident
connection with the mighty and mysterious mandarin, Yun Lai Kao,
together with what Wells had said of the mandarin, reassured me. If
I could evade the hatred of the unknown murderers until dark...</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a curse of annoyance, I remembered that at this
very moment I was supposed to be on my way to the beach to fight
Big John Clancy with my naked fists. Well, it must be done. Even if
I died that night, I must keep that appointment. I could not go out
with men thinking I dared not meet Big John in open fight. Besides,
the thought came to me, that was the safest place in Canton for
me&mdash;on the open beach, surrounded by men of my own race. The
problem lay in getting there alive. I made no further attempts to
find the crew, but set off at a rapid walk, keeping my eye alert
and passing alleyways very warily. Bill sensed my caution and kept
close to me, walking stiff-legged, rumbling deep and ominously in
his throat.</p>

<p>But I arrived unharmed at the strip of open beach behind the big
warehouses. Big John was already there, stripped to the waist,
growling his impatience and flexing his mighty arms. Froggy Ladeau
was there and half a dozen others, all friends of Clancy. Wells was
not there. I couldn't help wondering about that.</p>

<p>"I couldn't find any of my friends, Clancy," I said abruptly.
"But I'm not afraid of not getting fair play. I've always heard of
you as a square shooter. My dog won't interfere. I'll make him
understand that. But Froggy can hold him if you'd rather."</p>

<p>"You've kept me waitin'," growled Big John. "Let's get
goin'."</p>

<p>It's like a dream now, that fight on the Kago Tong beach. Men
still talk about it, from Vladivostok to Sumatra, wherever the
roving brotherhood gathers to spin old yarns over their
glasses.</p>

<p>"No kickin', gougin', or bitin'," Big John growled. "Let it be a
white man's fight."</p>

<p>And a white man's fight it was, there on the naked beach, both
of us stripped to the waist, with no weapons but our naked fists.
What a man John Clancy was! I was six feet tall and weighed 190
pounds. He stood six feet one and three quarter inches and he
weighed 230 pounds&mdash;all bone and muscle it was, with never an
ounce of fat on him. His legs were like tree trunks, his arms
looked as if they had been molded out of iron, and his chest was
arching and broad as a door. A massive, corded neck upheld a
lion-like head and a face like a Roman senator's.</p>

<p>I weighed my chances as we approached each other, I and this
giant who had never known defeat. In sheer strength and bulk he had
the edge. But I was strong, too, in those days, and I knew that I
was the faster man and the more scientific boxer.</p>

<p>He came at me like a charging bull and I met him half-way. Mine
was the skill or fortune to get in the first punch, a smashing left
hook square to the jaw. It stopped him dead in his tracks. But he
roared and came on again, shaking his lion-like head. I went under
his gigantic swings to rip both hands to his body. I was fast
enough and skilled enough to avoid his mightiest blows for a time,
but let it not be thought that I back-pedalled and ran, or fought a
merely defensive fight. Men do not fight that way on the
beach&mdash;or anywhere in the raw edges of the world.</p>

<p>I stood up to him and he stood up to me. My head was singing
with his blows and the blood trickled from my mouth. Blue welts
showed on his ribs and one of his eyes was closing.</p>

<p>He loomed like a giant over me as I ducked his terrible swing.
It whistled over my head and my glancing return tore the skin on
his ribs. Gad, his right hand whistled past my face like a white
hot brick, and when he landed he shook me from head to heel. But my
battles with men and with the Seven Seas had toughened me into
steel and whale-bone endurance. I stood up to it.</p>

<p>I was landing the more and cleaner blows. Again and again I had
him floundering, but always he came back with a crashing,
bone-crushing attack I could not altogether avoid. I bulled in
close, ducking inside his wide looping smashes, and ripped both
hands to body and head. I had the better at the infighting. But,
staggering under a machine-gun fire of short hooks and uppercuts,
he suddenly ripped up an uppercut of his own. Gad, my head snapped
back as if my neck was broken. Only blind instinct made me fall
into Big John and clinch before he could strike again. And I held
on with a grizzly grip not even he could break, until my head
cleared.</p>

<p>The onlookers had formed a tense ring about us. Their nails bit
into their clenching palms and their breaths came in swift gasps.
There was no other sound save the scruff of our feet on the beach,
the thud and smash of savagely driven blows, an occasional grunt,
and Bill's low, incessant growling.</p>

<p>Clancy's huge fist banged against my eye, half closing it. My
right crashed full into his mouth and he spit out a shattered
tooth.</p>

<p>My left hook was doing most of the damage. Big John was too fond
of using his right. He drew it back too far before he let it go.
Again and again I beat him to the punch with my left, and I made
raw beef out of the right side of his jaw. Sometimes he would duck
clumsily and my hook would smash on his ear, which was a beautiful
cauliflower before the fight was over. But I was not unmarked.</p>

<p>Things floated in a red mist. I saw Big John's face before me,
with the lips smashed and pulped, one eye closed and blood
streaming from his nose. My arms were growing heavy, my feet slow.
I stumbled as I side-stepped. The taste of blood was in my mouth.
How long we had stood toe to toe, exchanging terrific smashes, I
did not know. It seemed like ages. In chaotic, flashing glances, I
saw the strained, white, tense faces of the onlookers.</p>

<p>From somewhere smashed Big John's thundering right hand. Square
on the jaw it crashed. I felt myself falling into an abyss of
blackness, shot with a million gleams and darts of light. I struck
the beach hard, and the jolt of the fall jarred me back into my
senses. I looked up, shaking the blood and sweat out of my eyes,
and saw Big John looming above me. He was swaying, wide-braced on
his mighty legs. His great, hairy chest was heaving as his breath
came in panting gasps. I dragged myself to my feet. The knowledge
that he was in as bad a way as I, nerved my weary muscles.</p>

<p>"You must be made outa iron," he croaked, lurching toward me. I
took a deep breath and braced myself to meet his right. The blow
was a glancing one and I blasted both hands under his heart. He
reeled like a ship in rough weather, but came back with a left
swing that staggered me. Again he swung his right, like a club. I
ducked and straightened with a left hook that cracked on the side
of his head. But it was high. I felt my knuckles crumple. His knees
buckled and I put all I had behind my right. Like a swinging maul,
it smashed on Big John Clancy's jaw. And he swayed and fell.</p>

<p>I felt men about me, heard their awed congratulations, felt
Bill's cold wet nose shoved into my hand. Froggy was staring down
at the senseless form of Big John in a sort of unbelieving
horror.</p>

<p>Then came memory of Yuen Lao and the Yo Thans. I shook the blood
and sweat from my eyes, pulling away from the men who were pawing
over me. The sun was setting. If I expected to see that sun rise
again, I must meet Yuen Lao and go with him to Yun Lai Kao.</p>

<p>Snatching up my clothes, I tore away from the amazed men and
reeled drunkenly up the beach. Out of sight of the group, I dropped
from sheer exhaustion. It was minutes before I could rise and go
on.</p>

<p>My mind cleared as I walked, and my head ceased to sing from Big
John's smashes. I was fiercely weary, sore and bruised. It seemed
impossible for me to get my wind back. My left hand was swollen and
sore, and the skin was torn on my right knuckles. One of my eyes
was partly closed, my lips were smashed and cut, my ribs battered
black and blue. But the cool wind from the sea helped me, and with
the recuperative powers of youth and an iron frame, I regained my
wind, shook off some of my weariness and felt fairly fit as I
neared the Alley of Bats, in the growing darkness.</p>

<p>I found time to wonder why the Yo Thans had not struck again.
There was something unnatural about the whole business, it seemed
to me. Since that knife had been flung at me earlier in the day, I
had had no sign at all of the existence of that murderous gang.</p>

<p>I came unharmed to the narrow, stinking rat-den in the heart of
the native quarter which the Chinese call, for some unknown reason,
the Alley of Bats. It was pitch-dark there. I felt cold shivers
creep up and down my spine. Suddenly a figure loomed up beside me
and Bill snarled. In my nervousness I almost struck out at the
figure, when Yuen Lao's voice halted me. He was like a ghost in the
deep shadows. Bill growled savagely.</p>

<p>"Come with me," whispered Yuen Lao. And I groped after him. Down
that alley he led me. Across another even darker and nastier.
Through a wide shadowy courtyard. Down a narrow side street, deep
in the heart of what I knew must be a mysterious native quarter
seldom seen by white men. Down another alley and into a dimly
lighted courtyard. He stopped before a heavy arched doorway.</p>

<p>As he rapped upon it, I realized the utter silence, eeriness and
brooding mystery of the place. Truly, I was in the very heart of
ancient and enigmatic China, as surely as if I had been five
hundred miles in the interior. The very shadows seemed lurking
perils. I shuddered involuntarily.</p>

<p>Three times Yuen Lao rapped. Then the door swung silently
inward, to disclose a veritable well of darkness. I could not even
see who had opened the door. Yuen Lao entered first, motioning me
to follow. I stepped in, Bill crowding close after me. The door
slammed between us, leaving the dog on the outside. I heard the
click of a heavy lock. Bill was clawing and whining outside the
door. And then the lights came on. While I blinked like a blinded
owl, I heard a low throaty chuckle that sent involuntary shivers up
and down my spine. My eyes became accustomed to the light. I saw
that I was in a big room, furnished in true Oriental style. The
walls were covered with velvet and silken hangings, ornamented with
silver dragons worked into the fabric. A faint scent of some
Eastern incense or perfume pervaded the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Ranged about me were ten big, dark, wicked-faced men, naked
except for loin-cloths. Malays they were, tougher and stronger than
any Chinese. On a kind of tiger-skin covered dais across the room
an unmistakable Chinaman sat on a lacquer-worked chair. He was clad
in robes worked in dragons like those on the hangings, and his keen
piercing eyes gleamed through holes in the mask which hid his
features. But it was the figure which stood image-like beside the
lacquered chair which drew and held my gaze. It was the hatchet-man
from whom I had rescued Yotai T'sao on the wharfs that morning.</p>

<p>In a sickening instant I realized that I was trapped. Blind fool
that I was, to walk into the snare. A child might have suspected
that mask-faced snake of a Yuen Lao. He too was a Yo Than, I
realized. And he had not brought me to the Honorable and Benevolent
Yun Lai Kao. He had brought me before the nameless and mysterious
chief of the Yo Thans, to die like a butchered sheep.</p>

<p>And there he stood before me, Yuen Lao, smiling evilly. I acted
instinctively. Square into his mouth I crashed my right before he
could move. His teeth caved in and he dropped like a log.</p>

<p>The masked man on the dais laughed. And in his laughter sounded
all the ancient and heartless cruelty of the Orient.</p>

<p>"The white barbarian is strong and fierce," he mocked. "But this
night, my bold savage, you shall learn what it is to interfere with
the plans of Kang Kian of the Yo Thans. Fool, to pit your paltry
powers against mine. You, with the striding arrogance of your
breed.</p>

<p>"Know, fool, before you die, that the ancient dragon that is
China is waking slowly beneath the feet of the foreign dogs, and
their doom is not far off. Soon I, Kang Kian, master of the Yo
Thans, will come from the shadows, raise the dragon banner of
revolution and mount again the ancient throne of my ancestors. Your
fate will be the fate of all your race who oppose me. I laugh at
you. Do you deem yourself important because the future emperor of
China deigns to see personally to your removal? Bah! I merely crush
you as I crush the gnat that annoys me."</p>

<p>Then he spoke shortly to the Malays: "Kill him."</p>

<p>They closed in on me silently, drawing knives, strangling cords
and loaded cudgels. It looked like trail's end for Steve Costigan.
I, with two black eyes, ribs pounded black and blue, one hand
broken, from one fierce fight, pitted against these trained
killers. They approached warily. Bill, outside, sensing my peril,
began to roar and hurl himself against the bolted door. I tensed
myself for one last rush. The thought flashed through me that
perhaps Bill would escape my fate. I hoped that it might be so.</p>

<p>I drew back, tensed and watchful as a hawk. The ring was closing
in on me. The nearest Malay edged within reach. He raised his knife
for the death leap. I smashed my heel to his knee and distinctly
heard the bone snap. He went down. I leaped across him and hit that
closing ring as a plunging fullback hits a line.</p>

<p>Cudgels swished past my head. I felt a knife lick along my ribs.
Then I was through, bounding across the room and onto the dais.</p>

<p>Kang Kian screamed. He jerked a pistol from his robes. How he
missed me at that range, I cannot say. The powder flash burned my
face, but before he could fire again I knocked him head over heels
with a blow that was backed with the power of desperation. The
pistol flew out of reach.</p>

<p>The hatchet-man was on me like a clawing cat. He drove a long
knife deep into my chest muscles. Then I got in a solid smash. His
jaw was brittle. It crunched like an egg-shell. I swung his limp
form up bodily above my head and hurled him into the clump of
Malays who came leaping up on the dais, bowling over the front line
like ten-pins. The rest came at me.</p>

<p>Carried beyond myself on a red wave of desperate battle fury, I
caught up the lacquered chair and swung it with all my strength.
Squarely it landed and I felt my victim's shoulder bone give way.
But the chair flew into splinters. Then a whistling cudgel stroke
laid my scalp open and knocked me to my knees. The whole pack piled
on me, hacking and slashing. But their very numbers hindered them.
Somehow, I managed to shake them off momentarily and stagger
up.</p>

<p>A big Chinaman I had not seen before bobbed up from nowhere and
got a bone-breaking wrestling hold on my right arm. A giant Malay
was thrusting for my life. I could not wrench my right free. So,
setting my teeth, I slugged him with my broken left. I went sick
and dizzy from the pain of it, but the Malay dropped like a
sack.</p>

<p>But they downed me again, as my berserk fighting frenzy waned.
They swarmed over me and forced me down by sheer weight of
man-power. I heard Kang Kian yelling to them with the rage of a
fiend in his voice, and a big dark-skinned devil raised his knife
and drove it down for my heart. Somehow, I managed to throw up my
left arm and take the blade through it. That arm felt like I'd
bathed in molten lead.</p>

<p>Then I heard the door crash and splinter. A familiar voice
roared like a high sea. And something like a white cannon-ball hit
the clump of natives on top of me.</p>

<p>The press slackened as the group flew apart. I reeled up, sick,
dizzy and weak from loss of the blood that was spurting from me in
half a dozen places. As in a daze, I saw Bill leaping and tearing
at dark, howling figures which fell over each other trying to get
away. And I saw a white giant ploughing through them as a
battleship goes through breakers.</p>

<p>Big John Clancy!</p>

<p>I saw him seize a Malay in each hand, by the neck, crack their
heads together and throw them into a corner. A dusky giant ran in,
lunging upward with a stroke meant to disembowel, only to be
stretched senseless by one blow of Big John's mighty fist. The big
Chinaman&mdash;a wrestler, by his looks&mdash;got a headlock on
Clancy. But Big John broke the hold, wheeled and threw the wrestler
clear over his shoulders, head over heels. The Chinaman hit on his
head and he didn't get up.</p>

<p>That was enough for the Yo Thans. They scattered like a flock of
birds, all except Kang Kian, the masked lord. He sprang for the
fallen pistol. Before he could reach it, Bill, jaws already
streaming red, dragged him down. One fearful scream broke from the
Yo Than's yellow lips and then Bill's iron jaws tore out his
throat.</p>

<p>Big John came quickly toward me. "By golly, Costigan," he
rumbled, "you look like you been through a sawmill. Here, lemme tie
up some of them stabs before you bleed to death. You've lost a
gallon of blood already. We got to git you where you can git
dressed right. But for the time bein' we'll see can we stop the
bleedin'."</p>

<p>He ripped strips from his shirt and began to bandage me. Bill
climbed all over me, wagging his stump of a tail and licking my
hand.</p>

<p>I gazed at Big John in amazement. I had thought my own vitality
unusual, but Big John's endurance was beyond belief. He looked as
if he'd been mauled by a gorilla. I was astounded to realize the
extent to which I had punished him in our battle. Yet he seemed
almost as fresh and fit as ever. My smashes which had blackened his
eyes, smashed his lips, ripped his ears, shattered some of his
teeth and laid open his jaw, had battered him down and out, but had
not sapped the vast reservoir of his vitality. I had merely
weakened him momentarily and knocked him out, that was all, and
accomplishing that feat had taken more of my strength than it had
his.</p>

<p>"I supposed you'd be laid up for a week after our fight," I said
bluntly.</p>

<p>He snorted. "You must think I'm effeminate. I wasn't out but a
few minutes. And when I'd got back my breath, I was ready to go on
with the fight. Of course I'm kinda stiff and sore and tired-like,
right now, but that amounts to nothing.</p>

<p>"When I'd got my bearin's I looked around for you. Froggy and
them had a hard time convincin' me that I'd been licked, for the
first time in my life. I'll swear, I still don't see how it could
of happened. Anyway, I started right out to find you and take you
apart, because I was mighty near blind mad. A coolie had seen you
go into the Alley of Bats and I followed, not long behind you. I
know Canton better'n most white men, but I got clean tangled up in
all them alley-ways and courtyards.</p>

<p>"Then I heard your dog makin' a big racket. I knowed it was
yours, because they ain't but one dog in China with a voice like
his. So I come and found him roarin' and plungin' at the door and I
heard the noise inside. So knowin' you must be in some kind of a
jamb, I just up and busted in. Who was them thugs, anyhow?"</p>

<p>I told him quickly about Yotai T'sao and the Yo Thans. He
growled: "I mighta knowed it. I've heard of 'em. I bet they won't
put no snake sign on no more Americans very soon. Come on, let's
get outa here."</p>

<p>"I don't know how to thank you, Clancy," I said. "You certainly
saved my hide..."</p>

<p>"Aw, don't thank me," he grunted. "I couldn't see them mutts
bump off a white man. And you'd sure give 'em a tussle by yourself.
Naw, don't thank me. Remember I was lookin' for you to beat you
up."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "I hate to fight a man whose saved my life, but
if you're set on it..."</p>

<p>He laughed gustily and slapped me on the back. "Thunderation,
Steve, I wouldn't hit a man which has just stopped as many knives
as you have. Anyway, I'm beginnin' to like you. Who's this?"</p>

<p>A tall man in European clothes stepped suddenly into the
doorway, with a revolver in one hand.</p>

<p>"Wells!" I exclaimed. "What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Following a tip-off I got earlier in the evening," he said
crisply. "I got wind of a secret session of the Yo Thans to be held
here."</p>

<p>"So you are a Secret Service man after all," I said slowly. "If
I'd known that, I might not have all these knife-stabs in my
hide."</p>

<p>"I've been trailing the Yo Thans for some time," he answered.
"Working with special powers invested in me by British and Chinese
authorities. Whose this dead man?"</p>

<p>"He called himself Kang Kian and boasted that he was the
mysterious lord of the Yo Thans and the next emperor of China," I
answered, with an involuntary shudder, as I glanced at the grisly
havoc Bill's ripping fangs had wrought. Wells' eyes blazed. He
stepped forward and tore away the blood stained mask, revealing the
smooth yellow face and clean-cut aristocrat features of a
middle-aged China-man.</p>

<p>Wells recoiled with an exclamation.</p>

<p>"My word! Can it be possible! No wonder he delayed the aid he
promised the government, and only promised, I can see now, to avert
suspicion. And no wonder he was able to keep his true identity a
secret. Clancy, Costigan, this is the Honorable and Eminent Yun Lai
Kao."</p>

<p>"What, the philosopher and philanthropist?" Clancy, who knew
Canton, was even more amazed than I.</p>

<p>Wells nodded slowly. "What strange quirk in his nature led him
along this path?" he said half to himself. "What a mind he had.
What heights he might have risen to, but for that one twist in his
soul. Who can explain it?"</p>

<p>Clancy, who knew the Orient, seemed to be groping for words to
frame a thought.</p>

<p>"China," he said, "is China. And there's no use in a white man
tryin' to figger her out."</p>

<p>Aye, China is China&mdash;vast, aloof, inscrutable, the Sphynx
of the nations.</p>
