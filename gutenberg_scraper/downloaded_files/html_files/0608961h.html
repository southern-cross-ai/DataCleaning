<h1>THE CAFE OF TERROR</h1>

<h3>by</h3>

<h2>E. Phillips Oppenheim</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>The Marquis always talked very bad English when he was angry,
and this morning he was very angry indeed. Climbing up narrow and
precipitous paths upon a surface of loose stones, pushing his way
occasionally through brambles and undergrowth, and looking
downwards from heights, which always made him giddy, had been
undertakings which had combined to incense him. He was not
dressed or built for such mad escapades. The sight of Madelon,
bare-headed, and laughing, having the air of one to whom such
excursions, instead of being a torture, were a keen pleasure,
only irritated him, whereas the final note of exasperation he
discovered in the pleasant good temper of Mr. Samuel T.
Billingham, their guide and host, who, with a huge cigar in his
mouth, was walking with springy steps and unabated cheerfulness
up the path which the Marquis had passionately declared to be
only fit for goats and idiots.</p>

<p>"I can no further make this absurd promenade," the Marquis
announced, sinking on to a heap of stones and dabbing with a
scented pocket-handkerchief drops of moisture upon his forehead,
which must not be allowed to reach his eyebrows. "It is an
absurdity! I have a pain of the stomach, a pain of the knees, a
pain of the back. It is not for this I came. Where is the
automobile?"</p>

<p>"Poor uncle!" Madelon sympathised. "I had forgotten that you
were not used to walking. You should have lived in England as I
have done. But the view&mdash;you must admit that the view is
marvellous!"</p>

<p>The comments of the Marquis upon the view were delivered in
fluent and sacrilegious French. He displayed an acquaintance with
the various forms of blasphemy peculiar to his language which
moved even Mr. Billingham to wondering admiration.</p>

<p>"When I feel better," he concluded, after a moment's electric
pause, "I shall apologise. At present I will only say that the
view from the window of my <i>salon</i>, which takes in the
Casino and all that glorious sea, is better worth having."</p>

<p>"Less than a kilometre to go," Mr. Billingham declared. "I
reckon we shall strike the main road just beyond that clump of
firs, and that's where I told the car to pick us up. Another
quarter of an hour, Marquis, and we shall be in St.
F&eacute;lix."</p>

<p>"If one could only drink something!" the latter observed
pettishly, as he rose to his feet. "I miss my morning
ap&eacute;ritif."</p>

<p>"That's coming to you, sure," Mr. Billingham promised. "I've
done this tramp before, and unless I'm mistaken there's a little
caf&eacute; where this path joins the cart track."</p>

<p>The prospect was sufficiently encouraging to induce the
Marquis to struggle to his feet. They clambered another fifty
yards or so up the stony path and found themselves in a rough
track which had evidently been made by the carting of timber from
the other side of the ravine. A little way along there was a
small white-plastered building, to which Mr. Billingham
pointed.</p>

<p>"The Caf&eacute; du For&ecirc;t!" he exclaimed. "The worst
ever, so far as I remember, but a Dubonnet won't poison us."</p>

<p>The Marquis almost smiled.</p>

<p>"A Dubonnet will be acceptable," he admitted. "The place
appears poverty-stricken, but if one can secure an unopened
bottle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll find that," Mr. Billingham interrupted confidently.</p>

<p>A few minutes' further climb brought them to the caf&eacute;.
It was small, dilapidated and uninviting. Nevertheless it
proclaimed itself in rudely painted black letters to be a
restaurant where "<i>Vins et Consommations</i>" were to be
obtained. There were three iron tables outside with a couple of
chairs at each, but no sign of life. The door stood open and his
two companions followed Mr. Billingham inside. There was no one
behind the little counter, no one in the rude little compartment
with its sanded floor and benches in place of chairs. There were
bottles upon the shelves, however, and a tumbler half full of
brandy upon the counter. Mr. Billingham raised his voice and the
glasses around shook.</p>

<p>"Hallo there!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Allo, allo!" the Marquis echoed. "<i>N'y a-t-il personne ici
pour nous servir</i>?"</p>

<p>There was a stolid, unsympathetic lack of response. They
waited for a moment, then Mr. Billingham opened the door of the
room behind the bar and glanced around. It was a rough-looking
kitchen, with a stone floor and a few clumsy articles of
furniture. A string of onions, a scraggy piece of meat, and a
rabbit hung down from iron hooks in the ceiling. There were pots
and dishes upon the table, but no fire or any sign of recent
occupation. Mr. Billingham raised his voice again without result,
opened still another door, and called up a flight of flimsy
stairs&mdash;also without result. Then he returned to his
companions.</p>

<p>"There is no one about at all," he announced.</p>

<p>"You might try outside," Madelon suggested.</p>

<p>Outside there was no garden but a little clearing, a rudely
constructed shed built of pine logs from which the bark had not
been stripped, and a lean-to shelter, with a corrugated iron
roof, against the wall. Mr. Billingham again, in stentorian
tones, invited the presence of the missing innkeeper and again
without response. He returned to the bar.</p>

<p>"Deserted!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"They were preparing for a <i>f&ecirc;te</i> at the small
village we passed through last," Madelon remarked. "Perhaps the
people have gone there, or the man may work in the woods."</p>

<p>The Marquis smiled. He had been studying the labels upon the
bottles.</p>

<p>"At least," he pointed out, "they have left a bottle of
Dubonnet. Produce that excellent corkscrew of yours, my friend
Billingham. We will serve ourselves and leave the money."</p>

<p>They opened the bottle of Dubonnet which the Marquis had
dragged down from the shelf, found some thick wine-glasses, and
seated themselves before one of the rude tables outside. Madelon
gave a little exclamation of relief as they passed out into the
pine-scented sunshine.</p>

<p>"That place gave me the shivers," she declared. "It seemed so
very empty, so very silent."</p>

<p>"It's a lonely spot," Mr. Billingham agreed, pouring out the
Dubonnet. "They seem to have let off felling the timber round
here, and I guess that took the trade away."</p>

<p>"So long as they are absent," the Marquis said, "one owes them
gratitude that they left the place open. Never have I tasted
Dubonnet with a better flavour. Tell me, my friend Billingham,
how much further of this abominable promenade before we reach the
automobile?"</p>

<p>"Not more than half a kilometre," Mr. Billingham assured him.
"There's a little path which leads straight up to the road from
the cart track. There we shall find the automobile. In a few
minutes more we shall be in St. F&eacute;lix. After
that&mdash;the <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>!"</p>

<p>The Marquis breathed a little sigh of content and helped
himself once more from the bottle. Madelon, who had set her glass
down empty, was fidgeting about as though anxious to start.</p>

<p>"Hungry?" Mr. Billingham inquired.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I have taken a dislike to this place," she confided. "Am I
superstitious, I wonder? I have a terrible feeling about it."</p>

<p>The Marquis was sympathetic but entirely comfortable and not
disposed to hurry. He lit a cigarette and leaned back in his
chair.</p>

<p>"I understand," he murmured. "A deserted inn on the edge of
the forest! There are all the materials here for drama. There was
a story I once read&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly and the cigarette fell from his fingers.
Mr. Billingham sprang to his feet. Madelon, who had wandered a
few yards away from them and turned back towards the house, was
standing suddenly rigid, suddenly pale. The cry which had
startled them had escaped from her lips. She pointed to the
window above the door.</p>

<p>"There was a face there!" she cried. "Some one up in the
room!"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham remained composed.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess that isn't so terrible after all," he observed.
"I dare say there's some one ill there. Who was it&mdash;a man or
a woman?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," Madelon answered faintly. "It was&mdash;just
a face!"</p>

<p>"Seems to have given you a shock," Mr. Billingham continued.
"Sit down, Miss Madelon, and drink half a glass more of this
stuff. Guess I'd better hunt round and see if there's any help
wanted."</p>

<p>Madelon&mdash;young woman of nerve and courage though she
was&mdash;staggered into a chair and was utterly unable to raise
to her lips the glass which her uncle hastily filled. Mr.
Billingham disappeared inside the building. In about five minutes
he returned.</p>

<p>"There's only one room upstairs," he announced, "and there
ain't a soul in it."</p>

<p>"But I saw some one," Madelon protested.</p>

<p>He strolled a yard or two away and looked back at the window,
pausing a moment to relight his cigar which had gone out.</p>

<p>"Well, there's no one there now," he assured her. "There's
only one room and not a cupboard for a hiding-place. There are
two beds&mdash;both look as though they'd been slept in&mdash;but
there isn't a human being in the shanty. You can take my word for
it."</p>

<p>Madelon looked at him steadfastly. She had drunk some of the
Dubonnet and she was becoming herself again.</p>

<p>"Do you believe, then," she asked, "that I saw the face of
some one who does not exist?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't say you were the sort who saw spooks," Mr.
Billingham admitted. "All I say is, there's no one there
now."</p>

<p>"You must surely have realised, my dear Madelon," the Marquis
intervened, "whether the face was the face of a man or a
woman."</p>

<p>"I should have said that it was the face of a young man,"
Madelon replied, "but it might have been the face of a girl.
There was a mass of black hair. The face itself was smooth. It
was the eyes that were horrible."</p>

<p>"You don't say!" Mr. Billingham murmured with tolerant
sympathy. "Kind of scared, were they?"</p>

<p>Madelon rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"Please let us go now," she begged. "I cannot talk about it
any more. I can only assure you of one thing. Something terrible
has happened here. Please, Mr. Billingham!"</p>

<p>"We'll get right along," was the prompt response. "Ten francs
will square us for the bottle of Dubonnet, I guess&mdash;ten
francs and what's left of the bottle. I'll put it underneath the
glass&mdash;see? Now, we're right! Just a yard or two through the
trees and then we'll leave this place behind us."</p>

<p>"I hope," Madelon murmured as they passed swiftly back to the
cart track, "that I may be able to forget it."</p>

<p>The Marquis smiled.</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh, my child!" he exclaimed. "You are too sensitive,
too emotional! Material discomforts you scoff at. A fancy
sometimes tortures you. Behold, the good news!"</p>

<p>He pointed upwards. At the end of the path was the curling
main road and by the side of it the automobile Mr. Billingham had
hired for their day's excursion. No vehicle before had ever
appealed so greatly to the Marquis.</p>

<p>"We've struck it right after all," Mr. Billingham declared
with satisfaction. "Gee, how hot the sun is out here! Lunch on
the terrace in twenty minutes, Miss Madelon. Now, let's forget
that dirty little shanty and its spook!"</p>

<p>The spook was not so easy to forget. Madelon, with Mr.
Billingham as her escort, was on her way that evening from the
Casino to Ciro's when she suddenly gripped her companion's
arm.</p>

<p>"Look," she cried, in a tone vibrant with absolute terror.
"Look! The boy at that table!"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham's eyes followed her gesture. The young man was
certainly an unusual sight in such surroundings. His clothes,
although perfectly new, were clumsily fashioned and of the sort
worn on f&ecirc;te days by the peasants. His hat was pushed to
the back of his head, and, although it was of the sombrero order
affected by the mountaineers of the district, it failed to
conceal the masses of black hair which gave him almost a
grotesque appearance. His complexion was the usual burnt olive of
the Proven&ccedil;al labourer. It was again his expression which
arrested. His eyes were large and black, without either the
vacancy or the humour of the peasant on a holiday. They looked
neither at the people who passed, the trees and flowers of the
plaza, nor at the bottle of wine which stood half-empty by his
side. They seemed to be looking at something which, if it existed
at all, existed far away.</p>

<p>"That," Madelon said, "was the face I saw at the upstairs
window of that place this morning."</p>

<p>Her hand was clutching nervously at his arm. Mr. Billingham
patted it gently.</p>

<p>"Say, this boy has got on your nerves some," he declared.
"I'll go across and have a talk to him. Sit down and wait for
me."</p>

<p>"I think I will for a moment," Madelon acquiesced.</p>

<p>She seated herself on one of the benches by the side of the
pavement. Mr. Billingham crossed the road and addressed the boy
in hesitating but comprehensible French.</p>

<p>"Do you belong to the inn up near St. F&eacute;lix?" he
inquired. "The young lady and I were there this morning."</p>

<p>The boy stared at his questioner for a moment with parted lips
and terrified expression. He made absolutely no reply,
however.</p>

<p>"We could not find any one there," Mr. Billingham continued,
speaking with laborious care. "We hoped there was nothing
wrong."</p>

<p>The boy broke out into a stream of rapid, unintelligible
speech, to which Mr. Billingham listened in ever-increasing
confusion. He turned round to find Madelon by his side.</p>

<p>"Say, this young goat-herd has got hold of a lingo of his
own," he complained. "I don't know as any one but a monkey could
tell what he's chattering about. Seems kind of annoyed with me,
but I can't get a word of it."</p>

<p>"It is the dialect of the Italians here," Madelon explained.
"Let me try."</p>

<p>She spoke to him patiently. The boy only shook his head.
Presently he poured out another glass of wine and drank it. Then
he sat quite still, stolid and inattentive. He took no notice of
Madelon's questions. He showed no sign of understanding a word
she said. In the end she was seized by a sudden revulsion. She
tugged at her companion's arm.</p>

<p>"Come away!" she begged. "He will not reply. He pretends not
to understand me, though I believe that he does. Let us leave
him."</p>

<p>"Guess you're right," Mr. Billingham assented. "He's a crazy
loon, if ever there was one, or he wouldn't speak such gibberish.
Anyway, it's not our business."</p>

<p>They passed on. The young man looked after them sullenly and
helped himself to more wine. Ten minutes later, when Mr.
Billingham, obeying an unaccountable impulse, chose a moment when
Madelon was talking to some acquaintances and hurried back, the
chair was empty. The young man was gone.</p>

<p>"Anyway," Mr. Billingham murmured to himself, struggling
against a curious feeling of uneasiness, "it ain't our
affair."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Billingham had twice
declared that whatever trouble there might be or have been at the
little inn on the edge of the forest was not his affair, it was
barely ten o'clock in the morning when he left the automobile
which he had hired in the Square at Monte Carlo, clambered down
the steep path, made his way along the cart track, pushed through
the clump of trees and found himself before the caf&eacute;.
There was no smoke emerging from the chimney, and Mr. Billingham
gave a little start of surprise as he saw on the table, in front
of the still open door, the half-consumed bottle of Dubonnet and
the ten-franc note under one of the glasses.</p>

<p>"I guess passers-by round here are pretty scarce," he
ruminated. "Seems queer that whoever quit the place didn't
trouble to lock up. Left in a hurry, perhaps."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham would doubtless have scorned the suggestion
that he talked to himself for the fact of any pleasure he might
derive from hearing his own voice, and yet it was without a doubt
true that the uneasy feeling of the day before had returned to an
even larger extent. He pushed open the door. The half-emptied
tumbler was still upon the counter. Some little disarrangement of
the bottles upon the shelf, effected by their removal of the
bottle of Dubonnet, still existed. He threw open the door leading
to the kitchen and called out:</p>

<p>"Hallo there!"</p>

<p>There was no reply. He mounted the stairs with footsteps which
he was half-ashamed to admit were reluctant ones. The bedroom was
as empty as it had been on the previous day. There was no place
to hide anywhere&mdash;no other room. As he descended, however,
he realised that it was perfectly possible for the owner of the
face whom Madelon had seen there to have escaped by the back door
and reached the wood in the matter of a very few seconds. He
returned to the kitchen. Here he noticed for the first time that
by the side of the fireplace was a clumsy framework door, which
looked as though it might have led into a pantry or cupboard. He
moved towards it and raised the latch. Before he threw the door
open, he knew. When he closed it again&mdash;in the space of a
second or two&mdash;there were great beads of perspiration upon
his forehead. The colour had left his cheeks and the blood seemed
to have been drained from body. He staggered out into the bar,
gripped the counter for a moment, saw a bottle of Martell's
brandy on the bottom row of the shelf, seized it, made his
faltering way outside, knocked off its neck against the top of
one of the iron tables, and drank. ... Mr. Billingham was a
strong man and his recovery was prompt. Nevertheless, he was
breathing heavily as he hastened up the hill to where his
automobile was waiting.</p>

<p>"Drive to the Mairie at St. F&eacute;lix," he ordered....</p>

<p>Arrived at the Mairie&mdash;a small wistaria-covered building
on the outskirts of the straggling village of St.
F&eacute;lix&mdash;Mr. Billingham was ushered at once by a
gendarme into a bare little apartment with whitewashed walls and
a row of benches, in which a very formal-looking gentleman with a
closely-trimmed black beard, very smoothly brushed hair, and
gold-rimmed pince-nez, was seated at a table, signing documents.
His work for the morning had consisted of adjudicating upon a
highly important case of fowl stealing, and he looked with some
surprise at his visitor's precipitate entrance. Mr. Billingham's
opening statement was in far from lucid English. The magistrate,
with a puzzled expression, waved him to a seat.</p>

<p>"<i>Comment</i>, monsieur?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham pulled himself together. His French, though not
rapid, was fairly precise, and he had no difficulty in making
himself understood.</p>

<p>"A woman has been murdered at a little caf&eacute; at the edge
of the forest," he announced.</p>

<p>The magistrate gasped. The gendarme gasped.</p>

<p>"Continue, monsieur," the former begged.</p>

<p>Mr Billingham told his story. The magistrate gave him his
entire attention. It was a great day, this! A murder! Obviously a
murder, in his district! He began to make notes of Mr.
Billingham's statement. He was friendly but official. It was
quite hopeless for him to conceal the fact that the news had
filled him with pleasurable interest. It had been the secret
desire of his life to have the handling of such a case.</p>

<p>"I will accompany you to the inn myself at once, monsieur," he
announced, rising to his feet. "You can accommodate a gendarme,
perhaps, on the front of your car.... Let the Court remain open
till my return," he directed a subordinate. "Tell me again your
story as we proceed, monsieur."</p>

<p>Mr Billingham went through the few facts again. In response to
his own inquiries the magistrate gave him certain
information.</p>

<p>"The inn," he said, "was kept by a very respectable, good man,
of the name of Pierre Anson. He lived there with his wife, the
woman who without a doubt is the victim, and his nephew, a young
man of whom one hears not too much of good. The wife, it is
reported, had savings&mdash;savings of some account&mdash;and the
nephew knew it. Three days ago news came to Anson of the death of
a relative in Marseilles. This I know because he came to me for
information as to the burying of the relative and as to his
journey. He set off last Monday morning. He was expecting to
return to-night. He left alone his wife and this nephew. One
fears to reflect what may have happened!"</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham sighed, because he was a kind-hearted man, and
because a vision of that flashing knife of the guillotine is
terrible to such. Nevertheless it was his duty.</p>

<p>"Last night," he confided, "the young man, who apparently was
the nephew of Pierre Anson, was drinking wine at the Caf&eacute;
de Paris in Monte Carlo. He was pointed out to me by the young
lady, who declared that his was the face she saw at the
window."</p>

<p>The magistrate nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"It is a crime," he said, "in effect simple, not uncommon
amongst this race of people. When heated with wine and drunk with
the desire of pleasure, the shedding of blood is nothing. I, who
tell you this, know."</p>

<p>They arrived at their destination. The magistrate and the
gendarme made their way to the little room. Mr. Billingham sat
outside. He had no soul for horrors. It was an hour before they
rejoined him. The magistrate was carrying his notebook in his
hand.</p>

<p>"All is clear," he announced. "The savings of the poor woman
have disappeared. To-night, or to-morrow at the latest, the young
man will be in our hands. Your name and address, if you please,
monsieur. You will attend the Court?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," Mr. Billingham promised.</p>

<p>"The young man," the magistrate continued, "will have had two
nights of that wild pleasure of which he has lain awake, here in
this place of tranquillity, and dreamed.
Afterwards&mdash;well&mdash;he may escape with the penitentiary.
One knows little of his age."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham looked up at the blank window. The silence
which brooded over the place remained unbroken. A gendarme,
having closed the door, seated himself outside.</p>

<p>"Pierre Anson will arrive by the night train," the magistrate
remarked. "It will be a sad home-coming for him."</p>

<p>"Better," Mr. Billingham rejoined, with a little shiver, "than
if he had found the house empty and opened that door, as I
did."</p>

<p>The most pathetic sight in the bare, whitewashed little room
of the Mairie on the first morning of the examination was Pierre
Anson, the woodman. The tears streamed down his brown, wrinkled
face as the magistrate addressed his first few kindly questions.
He had, at one time, as was evident, been a man of great stature
and strength. Now he seemed shrunken up, stricken with the horror
of his home-coming.</p>

<p>"Your wife had savings, Pierre Anson?" the magistrate asked
him.</p>

<p>"She was a thrifty woman," was the tremulous reply. "She had
always a stocking."</p>

<p>"Do you know how much was in it?"</p>

<p>"She never told me."</p>

<p>"Did your nephew&mdash;the young man between the gendarmes
there&mdash;the young man whom you trusted alone with your
wife&mdash;did he know?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," Pierre Anson answered. "He was always wanting
money."</p>

<p>"You have been to Marseilles to bury a relative&mdash;is it
not so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p>"You thought it safe to leave this youth, of whose character
we hear little that is good, alone with your wife in such a
desolate spot?"</p>

<p>"She was his aunt," the man announced, with a little sob. "How
would I dream of anything so horrible?"</p>

<p>The magistrate bent over his papers. Mr. Billingham, seated by
his side, watched the shaft of sunlight which had found its way
through the cobwebbed windows and had fallen upon the boy's face.
Madelon, who had also been invited by the magistrate to occupy a
chair near him, scribbled something on a piece of paper and
passed it to her neighbour. He glanced at it and passed it on to
the magistrate, who studied it through his pince-nez with pursed
lips. Finally, with a little shrug of the shoulders, he twiddled
it between his fingers.</p>

<p>"Where did you stay in Marseilles, Pierre Anson?" he asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>The woodman lifted his head and stared uncomprehendingly at
his questioner.</p>

<p>"I asked you where you stayed in Marseilles," the magistrate
repeated.</p>

<p>Pierre Anson shook his head.</p>

<p>"I do not remember," he said. "It was a small lodging-house
down by the quay."</p>

<p>"You do not remember?" the magistrate echoed, in a tone of
some surprise. "Is that not strange, Pierre Anson?"</p>

<p>"It was somewhere near where my cousin lay dead," the man
answered, a little sullenly. "I could find the place&mdash;the
name I never knew."</p>

<p>The magistrate's right arm suddenly shot out.</p>

<p>"Or is it that you are lying, Pierre Anson?" he thundered. "Is
it that you yourself, before you left home in the small hours of
that Tuesday morning, murdered your wife and stole her savings,
forced two of the notes on that half-witted youth, persuaded him
to buy clothes and go down to Monte Carlo, and went yourself to
Nice&mdash;your <i>rendezvous</i> at Nice&mdash;to your
<i>rendezvous</i> with Lucie B&eacute;rard?"</p>

<p>The man half-rose to his feet. His eyes seemed suddenly
bloodshot. He swayed about as though striving to speak.</p>

<p>"Bring the woman," the magistrate ordered.</p>

<p>Pierre Anson glanced fearfully towards the door. A woman in
the care of a gendarme entered. They looked at one another across
the room&mdash;the man and the woman&mdash;and one
understood.</p>

<p>"The money of which you robbed your wife, Pierre Anson," the
magistrate continued, "was found upon this woman. You have
visited her month by month in Nice. You would have thrust the
burden of this crime upon your nephew. You yourself are the
murderer! Do you confess?"</p>

<p>A cry rang through the Court&mdash;not from the man, Pierre
Anson, who was indeed incapable of speech, whose hands were
fighting the air, who fought against unconsciousness, but from
the boy who stood between the gendarmes. His eyes were fixed upon
the woman who had entered the Court Room, His indifference had
vanished. His eyes again were lit with fear.</p>

<p>"Mother!" he cried.</p>

<p>"It is I!" she answered.</p>

<p>The boy turned towards the magistrate.</p>

<p>"It was I who killed the woman," he pleaded. "No one else
knows anything about it."</p>

<p>"You are a liar and a fool!" the woman declared angrily. "It
was he, the bungler there," she added, pointing to Pierre Anson.
"And there is the money."</p>

<p>She dashed a bundle of notes upon the floor and stood with
folded arms, defiant, the incarnation of an evil spirit. A
gendarme touched Pierre Anson upon the shoulder. The proceedings
were over.</p>

<p>Afterwards the magistrate entertained his two distinguished
guests with a bottle of sweet wine and biscuits in his
retiring-room. He was well pleased with the whole business.</p>

<p>"Amongst the lowest classes of our peasants," he explained,
"these family dramas are not uncommon. Pierre Anson, as the story
goes now, loved both sisters. He married the older one&mdash;a
widow with money. The rest of the story unfolds itself. Yet
Pierre Anson had cunning which few of these peasants possess. He
deceived us all. It is to you, monsieur," he added, turning to
Mr. Billingham, "that we owe the clue by means of which we
arrived at the truth."</p>

<p>Mr. Billingham shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not to me," he rejoined; "to the young lady."</p>

<p>The magistrate bowed.</p>

<p>"Then might one inquire," he ventured, "what led the young
lady to doubt the lad's guilt?"</p>

<p>Madelon was once more serious.</p>

<p>"Something in his eyes," she confided, with a little shudder
of reminiscence; "something which was there and something which
was nor there."</p>

<p>The magistrate raised his glass and bowed first to Madelon,
then to Mr. Billingham.</p>

<p>"Something in his eyes," he repeated. "Well, one reads
somewhere in a lay commentary upon our laws and the discovery of
crime, that the born detective must have an instinct for the
truth. Mademoiselle, there is a great vocation open to you."</p>

<p>Madelon smiled. She sipped her wine, but she remained
silent.</p>
