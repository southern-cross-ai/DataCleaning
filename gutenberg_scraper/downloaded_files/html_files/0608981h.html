<h3><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h3>

<p>The first man I met in my club was John Chester, M.P. It must
have been some time in the March of 1920, and I was just home
from four years' service in India. And to be candid I was not at
all certain that I altogether appreciated this changed England
into which I had come. Some things I did not at first understand;
others I soon discovered would never be in the least to my
liking. But it was good to see John Chester again, he, I knew
well, would not have changed for all the wars in the world. And
to see him there, cool and dignified, in the well-remembered grey
morning coat, was like finding a piece of the old England which
for all those four years had for ever been in my mind.</p>

<p>He stared at me in that curiously magisterial manner of his,
and held my hand in his own for a rather longer time than
Englishmen generally give to the business. Then he took me away
to his own particular corner.</p>

<p>"Since you went away," he said, "the powers that be have made
many astonishing discoveries. The one that chiefly concerns us at
the moment has reference to drink. I am sorry to say, my dear
friend, that for years we have all been drinking far too much
alcohol. Far too much," he repeated solemnly, and then smiled.
"We are now forbidden to drink during the hours when a drink is
most welcome." He looked at his watch. "H'm, just an hour and a
half to wait. Well, that will be enough for a short history of
India during the Great War, with details of the Hunnish plots you
unearthed, and what the Amir of Afghanistan&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I was lighting my pipe. "For four years," I told him, "I have
been soldiering after a fashion, and occasionally playing
detective. I don't want to hear another word about the Army or
the Police. Both are excellent bodies, but you can have too much
of them. Here I am back in my club and you're the first person I
see. Doesn't that suggest something to you? Don't you think that
after four years away I deserve something in the nature of
a&mdash;story?"</p>

<p>"A story?" John Chester repeated the word with the air of a
man who has never told a story in his life. "A story from a man
who has spent four years of his life making crutches very slowly
and very badly for soldiers who had never done him any harm? What
sort of a story d'you suppose <i>I</i> have to tell <i>you</i>?"
But I could see that he was pleased. There was that queer little
twinkle in his eye&mdash;the preparatory twinkle.</p>

<p>"I'm waiting," said I, "and in India I learnt patience."</p>

<p>"There is one story," he went on after a moment's pause, "but
I doubt whether it would amuse you. The war does not venture to
intrude, and that is in its favour, but on the other hand I am
afraid it is rather unsatisfactory. Very unsatisfactory. In fact,
I'm not at all sure that it isn't the most maddening story in the
world."</p>

<p>"Exactly what I require."</p>

<p>"But when I've told it to you, you'll never speak to me
again."</p>

<p>"We can see about that."</p>

<p>"Very well then."</p>

<p>I settled myself back in the huge easy-chair, and prepared to
be maddened.</p>

<p>"It is not really my story," he began, putting the tips of his
fingers together. "I dare say you may even have heard it before.
For myself I know of at least three different accounts of the
strange experience of Lord Brassington, and rather fancy to have
seen a fourth, badly garbled, in one of the popular magazines.
Brassington, as I dare say you know, was killed on the
Somme."</p>

<p>"I remember something&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, a very brave man.... But his strange experience had
nothing to do with the war. It happened, I think, in 1910 or the
following year, at the time of the first Commission on Housing.
He worked like a Trojan. You met him once or twice on the Terrace
with me&mdash;a tall dark man, you remember, who stooped, and
dressed very shabbily indeed. An earnest person like his father
before him. It was the old man who wrote those two volumes on the
<i>Psychology of Crowds</i>&mdash;a remarkable production which I
commend to your attention. Very well. Brassington overworked
himself and very wisely determined to take a long holiday. For
some time he had wanted to travel about, and he finally decided
upon a sort of irregular pilgrimage throughout Europe. It was
typical of him that he should travel alone and with no settled
plans."</p>

<p>"He could certainly have afforded a valet," said I, recalling
the square solidity of Brassington House in Mayfair.</p>

<p>"He could," agreed John Chester. "It is perhaps a pity that he
did not. As it happened, not all the cheques in the world could
have made that pilgrimage a success."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment or two in the old Chester way.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was at Brussels that he met the Comte d'Anoury. He
was staying at one of the smaller hotels at the time. He had
dined alone and was enjoying his coffee in the lounge and
wondering whether he would go on the next morning to Paris or
stay and see something of Belgium. Ypres, I remember was one of
the places he wanted to see. He could not make up his mind. And
that, you know, was essentially Brassington's weak point. He was
one of those unfortunate people who so often look to somebody
else to make up their minds for them. On this particular evening
it was the Comte D'Anoury who decided for him.</p>

<p>"A gentleman with one of those square beards which Leopold
made so fashionable, came into the lounge and went straight up to
Brassington.</p>

<p>"'Pardon me,' said he with a bow, 'but have I the pleasure of
addressing the Earl of Brassington?'</p>

<p>"'You have,' replied Brassington.</p>

<p>"It then appeared that the Belgian had known the old lord very
well, and had been in repeated communication with him over the
publication of the <i>Psychology of Crowds</i>. In fact it was
D'Anoury who had been largely responsible for the French
translation.</p>

<p>"You can imagine that the two men soon found much to talk
about. The Comte ultimately invited the son of his old friend to
visit his chateau, an invitation that was at once accepted. And
it was in the Chateau D'Anoury that the fatal card was presented
to our friend....</p>

<p>"It seems that Brassington mentioned his proposed European
pilgrimage to his host, who speedily showed himself to be a much
travelled man. There was hardly a good hotel in Europe,
Brassington told me, which he did not know. Information of a kind
which falls to the lot of no Cook's tourist was placed
unreservedly at Brassington's disposal. Their relations became
even more cordial, and on the last evening of our friend's stay
at the chateau the card was preferred and accepted.</p>

<p>"Now I must tell you that one of Brassington's weak points was
his ignorance of foreign languages. His French was of the
<i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i> order, and his German negligible. Of
Russian, Italian, or Spanish he knew nothing at all. I doubt
whether he'd realized that in the south-eastern corner of Europe
over a hundred distinct languages were in daily use. He was
sufficiently insular to imagine that English, particularly when
spoken in a loud voice, and a smattering of French would carry
him through&mdash;as they so often do. Well, the Comte D'Anoury
discovered this fact, and in his hospitable way suggested that he
might be of some little assistance. He took out of his card-case
a blank card&mdash;exactly similar, I mean, to an ordinary
visiting card, but quite plain. Then he scribbled a few words on
it, and handed it over.</p>

<p>"'If you should go to any of the hotels I've mentioned,' said
he, 'this may be of use. Often a stranger is not given the most
comfortable room.'</p>

<p>"Brassington thanked him and looked at the writing. He did not
recognize the language, although he was convinced that it was
neither French nor German. It did not seem to be Italian or
Spanish, but, as Brassington told me afterwards, he thought,
without knowing why, that it might be Russian."</p>

<p>"Didn't he inquire?" I asked.</p>

<p>John Chester looked at me. "I was expecting that question. In
point of fact, he was about to inquire when the Comtesse came
into the room. He just put the card in his pocket and forgot all
about it. The next morning he journeyed to Paris and was driven
to the hotel of which the Belgian had spoken. I've forgotten the
name, but it was a small, comfortable sort of place, rather
old-fashioned. The guide-books would have called it select and
possibly have omitted to tell you its rate of charges.
Brassington found it entirely to his liking. It was not too dull,
and the proprietor spoke English extremely well. He had been an
hotel manager in London, and was enough of a snob to find
pleasure in having a British peer under his roof. And there was a
particular old brandy in his possession which Brassington greatly
appreciated. In fact, I gather, they drank quite a number of
glasses together in the privacy of the proprietor's own sanctum.
Don't think for one moment that Brassington ever took too much in
his life. He didn't. He was the last sort of man to do anything
of the kind. But he liked the old man and he liked the old
brandy, and he was enjoying a holiday.</p>

<p>"He stayed a fortnight at that hotel and had a right joyous
time. In fact, he was in no hurry to continue his pilgrimage.
Paris, as you probably know, has its own fascinations, and
Brassington would have been well content to stay there for
months. He went to the play, he heard fine music, and he went for
long walks. And so pleased was he with the few Frenchmen whose
acquaintance he made that he had almost decided to treat himself
to a <i>pied-&agrave;-terre</i> in their capital. He did, indeed,
seek the proprietor's advice on this very point. But the hotel
proprietor did not seem too keen on the proposition. Doubtless he
saw no reason why milord should not continue to put money into
his own pocket. And it was then that Brassington, without knowing
why, remembered the Belgian's card.</p>

<p>"'By the way,' he said suddenly, 'I think you know the Comte
D'Anoury.'</p>

<p>"'Monsieur?'</p>

<p>"'A frequent visitor here, surely?'</p>

<p>"The proprietor shrugged his shoulders. 'Possibly,' said he,
with no sign of his usual enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Brassington, I think, was piqued. He took out the card, and
immediately experienced the curious idea that he was embarking on
an adventure altogether outside his ken. That is how he expressed
himself to me when he told me his story. Well, he took out his
card, and handed it over.</p>

<p>"And then something odd immediately happened."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h3>

<p>"I lay stress," continued John Chester, "on Brassington's
feelings at this moment. He never quite understood why he handed
over the card. It would have been easy for him to have visited an
ordinary house-agent without the proprietor's help. In fact, had
he thought about the matter at all, he would surely have seen
that the proprietor would naturally not be too keen to see the
departure of his guest. But he didn't think. He just took the
card out of his pocket and handed it over.</p>

<p>"And then a queer little pang raced through his body, a pang
of shame or horror or&mdash;fright. He told me afterwards that
before the proprietor spoke, he was convinced that he'd made the
biggest mistake of his life. And he was angry with himself. But
he was also unmistakably afraid, for it suddenly seemed to him
that, to use one of our modern turns of slang, he was up against
<i>something</i> which would render him powerless and absurd if
nothing worse. He tried to pull himself together. What
significance could the mere handing over of a card with some
half-dozen words scribbled on it, possibly have? His commonsense
told him none, but his instinct sent a warning in that tiny pang.
And so he just sat there and waited."</p>

<p>There came another of those little pauses of which John
Chester makes such frequent use. I think he likes to see the
mouth of his audience open a little, awaiting some expression of
tense interest.</p>

<p>"You pique my curiosity," I told him.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was certainly rather curious," he continued with
irritating deliberation. "The hotel proprietor behaved so very
oddly. As I have told you, Brassington knew immediately that
something was wrong, but he'd no means of knowing just
<i>what</i> would account for the extraordinary change in the
proprietor's manner. For over the man's face there had come an
expression which was interpreted without much difficulty. As
Brassington told me, he looked angry, insulted,
and&mdash;disgusted. And it was the man's ill-hidden disgust
which he could never forget. 'I felt a cad,' he said, 'a dirty
cad, guilty of all the most horrible crimes you can think of. And
the odd thing was that although I knew I was absolutely innocent
I felt that the man's attitude was&mdash;justified. In some
curious way, it did seem to me that I had been guilty of foul
horrors. He handed me back the card, and I faced him shivering
like a criminal in the dock for the first time.'</p>

<p>"That was what our good Brassington felt&mdash;a criminal, and
the feeling was intensified when the proprietor with another look
of disgust spat on the floor and walked over to the telephone.
And Brassington listened as in a dream to the conversation that
followed. He could not fully understand, but he knew enough to
learn that the police were being summoned. And still he sat
there, unable to move, unable to think.</p>

<p>"Well, they fetched him. They took him away, him and his
luggage, in the middle of the night. He tried to protest. He
mentioned our Ambassador, who happened to be a distant cousin of
his mother's. He tried to be angry. He tried to behave in that
rather silly way most Englishmen do behave when they become
unexpectedly involved in a police row abroad. But he could do
nothing.... He was put in a train with three detectives and
escorted to the German frontier, and the three detectives lost no
opportunity of showing what they thought of him. Obviously they
hated their job; obviously they found the mere presence of the
Englishman unspeakably offensive. And he felt more than ever like
a criminal. It didn't occur to him that he could have demanded to
know the reason for his expulsion: he just sat in the train
half-dazed."</p>

<p>"But I can't understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a little," begged John Chester, smiling; "there was
worse to come. Our friend Brassington arrived in Cologne, where,
you may remember, there is an Englishehof, and there under that
solemn roof he was able in some measure to recover. He found the
stolid, orderly methods of the Germans extraordinarily soothing
and peaceful after his untoward experience in France, and
although some days passed before he felt able to walk out in the
streets like an ordinary tourist, he succeeded in persuading
himself that the old brandy must have been stronger than he had
supposed, and was in some way responsible for the affair. It was
a poor enough explanation, but it was all he could summon to his
aid. The brandy, he found himself thinking, might have been
drugged.... Something of that sort....</p>

<p>"And then for a fortnight nothing happened. He spent his time
exploring Cologne, where, by the way, there is much that is
usually interesting. He made an effort to learn German. He met in
casual fashion two or three English friends. And once or twice
behind locked doors he took out the Belgian's card and attempted
to decipher the words. And here I would have you notice a curious
point. When Brassington looked at the card, locked up alone in
his own room, it seemed harmless and even vaguely helpful. It was
only when it was shown.... But I am anticipating.</p>

<p>"Brassington went on to Berlin, where an uncle of his was in
the Embassy. They spent an enjoyable week together, and no
mention was made of the card. Then our friend crossed the
Austrian frontier and ultimately arrived in Prague. Yes, Prague,"
repeated John Chester thoughtfully. "At Prague something else
happened."</p>

<p>"He showed the card?" I hazarded.</p>

<p>"Not exactly. The card was asked for. It seemed that
Brassington chose his hotel by the merest chance. At the station
there were several hotel porters waiting. He picked out one of
them at random, and had his luggage placed on a shabby old
omnibus which rumbled slowly along the picturesque streets.
Prague, you know, is one of the most romantically picturesque
cities in Europe. I remember in '89...." For a moment he became
vague. "Yes, well, as I was telling you, Brassington chose his
hotel haphazard. He found it on the outskirts of the town, a
rather lonely old pile, once, no doubt, some Czech nobleman's
house, but now disfigured in the usual way by gigantic gold
letters. I forget the name those letters formed, but it was
vaguely familiar to Brassington. And then, when they were showing
him to his room, he remembered: the Comte D'Anoury had mentioned
this particular hotel as a favourite resort of his own....</p>

<p>"Five minutes later a thin fair man in some uniform which
Brassington did not recognize had come into his room. He spoke
broken English, and seemed to be in a very bad temper.</p>

<p>"'You 'ave come from Berlin?' he snapped.</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"'An' you 'ave ze card?'</p>

<p>"Our friend was horribly startled, not only by the unexpected
question, but also by the look on the man's face. It was a look
of devilish hate and cruelty. But he pulled himself together.
After all, it was surely nobody's business if he chose to carry
the damned card. He was an Englishman travelling for
pleasure&mdash;with a banking account that would have roused the
envy of every Austrian official, had its full extent been known.
He was not going to be bullied. He attempted to bluster.</p>

<p>"'I don't know what you mean,' he said in a loud voice.
'You've evidently made some mistake. I am Lord Brassington, a
British subject.'</p>

<p>"The man in uniform seemed to be almost trembling with fury.
'Dere are some men,' he said with incredible bitterness, 'too bad
to 'ave ze nationality. Show me ze card.'</p>

<p>"'I absolutely decline,' Brassington spoke warmly.</p>

<p>"The thin man blew a whistle. Four soldiers appeared, and in
another moment our poor friend was being searched none too
kindly. The card of course was easily found&mdash;Brassington
still kept it in his card-case&mdash;and handed over to the
leader of the party.</p>

<p>"Half an hour later the fifth Earl of Brassington was confined
in the filthiest cell of the prison-fortress of Prague."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h3>

<p>"Now, if you or I were to find ourselves in such a position we
should know what to do. We should talk very loudly of the mighty
arm of Britannia, and threaten all sorts of personal reprisals.
And the Governor would be gravely polite and full of regrets that
he was unable to help us. And then in some way or other we should
succeed in getting a message through to the Consulate. I don't
know myself how one does such things, but I feel convinced that
we should." John Chester smiled. "Possibly nothing more than a
few judicious bribes and nice crisp English bank-notes. And then,
there'd be a coming and going of all sorts of higher officials,
and delays and telegrams, and finally a grovel from some
semi-royal personage. Whereupon we should walk out with our heads
very high, secretly rather pleased with ourselves that the affair
had really occurred. Something to talk about, you understand, on
our return home."</p>

<p>"Quite so," I agreed laughing, "but I can hardly see myself
languishing in a Bohemian jail&mdash;at least, before the
war&mdash;without a pretty good effort to find out the
reason...."</p>

<p>"And yet our friend took no steps at all. He found himself all
unconceivably a prisoner in an Austrian dungeon, which I gather
is even nastier than most other dungeons, unable to eat the
appalling food he was given, quite helpless and stunned. He
became, of course, physically ill. He admitted to me that he more
than once began to cry like a child. And I fancy he must have
become light-headed, because he told me that at the time he could
hardly be certain that he was Brassington at all. The card had
been returned to him, and he spent hours with it in his hands,
trying to fathom its mystery. A little piece of pasteboard! Some
half-dozen words! But it might be symbolic? Yet even so how...
There seemed to him to be no solution whatsoever. Moreover, he
was by no means unconscious of the change in himself. He knew
that he ought to be rousing himself to fight against the enigma,
whatever it might be; but he couldn't. As you know, Brassington
was ordinarily a strong healthy man. I remember seeing him box
for Oxford. But in the prison at Prague he could do
nothing&mdash;nothing at all."</p>

<p>"I should have thought he might have found it advisable to
destroy the card."</p>

<p>"My dear man, that was my first question when he told me what
happened in Prague. Why on earth didn't he destroy it? There were
two reasons, I think. In the first place he could never persuade
himself when alone that the card held any undue significance at
all. In the second place he never gave up hope that the day would
come when a complete explanation would appear."</p>

<p>"Of course it did?" I interrupted with some eagerness.</p>

<p>"Lord Brassington," continued my friend imperturbably,
"remained in that prison-fortress for nearly three weeks. Then
one evening when he was so weak that he could hardly stand up, he
was taken away in the Austrian equivalent of our Black Maria. He
told me that this was the most painful journey he had ever
experienced. The roads must have been awful, but just as he was
deciding that he could not stand another yard of jolting, the
Black Maria stopped. He was helped out. A huge grey motor-car
stood there in the moonlight. To his surprise he found that his
own luggage had been placed in the tonneau. The next day he was
over the Italian frontier....</p>

<p>"It is true that Italy had been included in his pilgrimage,
and for a week or so Brassington basked in the sun. He stayed in
some small inn, and for some reason or other gave a false name.
He wanted, he told me, to lose himself entirely&mdash;to forget
what he had gone through. Incidentally he came to the conclusion
that nothing should make him show the card to anybody else. True,
at Prague they had asked for it, but he had stayed at half a
dozen other places and they had not asked for it. For some reason
he did not think that they would ask him for it in Italy.</p>

<p>"And then he met the Greek.</p>

<p>"A Greek gentleman came to the little inn: a diminutive, dark,
pasty-faced man, very dapper and polite. Brassington hardly
noticed him at first, but they happened to meet one evening on a
bridge outside the village. The Greek gentleman bowed and spoke
of the scenery. Brassington made some reply, and then found
himself listening to an enthusiastic account of the beauties of
Greece. So immeasurably superior, it seemed, to this flamboyant
Italy. Brassington spoke of our English landscapes, and the Greek
appeared extraordinarily interested. For England, he said, the
home of true liberty, he had always entertained the warmest
admiration and respect, and it was while he was giving tongue to
these pleasant opinions that the strange idea about the card came
into Brassington's mind. It suddenly seemed to him absolutely
certain that the words which Comte D'Anoury had so hurriedly
scribbled must be modern Greek. And in his excitement he forgot
his resolution.</p>

<p>"'I wonder,' he said abruptly, 'if you would do me a
favour?'</p>

<p>"The Greek, it seemed, would be enchanted.</p>

<p>"'I have reason to believe that some words on a card I possess
are written in your language. You could possibly translate them
for me.'</p>

<p>"The Greek gentleman would be delighted.</p>

<p>"Now, so far as I can gather, this is what happened. With a
strong feeling that the mystery was about to be solved,
Brassington handed over the card. He experienced no sense of
shame or disgust as he did so. The Greek gentleman, it seemed to
him, would just translate, and then they would continue to speak
of the scenery.... The next moment he was lying on his back in
the road with a sharp pain in his side.</p>

<p>"The Greek gentleman had stabbed him and was gone ..."</p>

<p>John Chester looked at me. "To be frank with you," he
continued, "I know very little about knife-wounds, but this one
of Brassington's seems to have been no more than superficial. He
saw his own blood, but seems to have easily stanched the flow. In
any case he was able to stagger back to the inn, there to learn
that the Greek gentleman had suddenly departed. The people were
kind to him. They asked no questions, but sent for a doctor and
helped him to bed. And it was while he was being undressed that
he found the card sticking out of his waistcoat pocket....</p>

<p>"It was a bad shock. Anywhere else I suppose there would have
been no little rumpus, but here nothing was said. The English
gentleman had met with an accident and would be leaving in a few
days' time. And leave he did as soon as he felt well enough. He
did not know what he wanted to do, but he felt he must travel. He
debated the idea of an immediate return to England, but something
was preventing it. Ultimately he came to Naples, nervously
apprehensive and yet at the same time convinced that before going
home he must in some way solve the enigma.</p>

<p>"He stayed at the Hotel de Vesuve and almost immediately ran
into Archie Summers and his wife."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">

<p>"You know Sir Archibald Summers? The cricketer, I
mean&mdash;one of the splendidest fellows I ever knew. He got his
Brigade early on in the war and was killed at Loos. Brassington
and he were old friends. They used to meet at White's. Lady
Summers was one of those pretty Hemingway girls, the eldest I
fancy. At any rate the two men were delighted to meet, and
Brassington joined their table. He told me that the relief of
finding an old friend here in Naples was extraordinary. At dinner
that night he could hardly believe that anything untoward had
happened to him. And yet barely an hour later....</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, butl want you to understand that Archie
Summers was absolutely loyal, a level-headed man of the world,
the sort of man you naturally went to when in trouble. As I
happen to know, he got more than one youngster out of a scrape. A
splendid friend to have. And it is important you should realize
this, because it makes what followed on their meeting so strange.
You have to think of Summers, not as a narrow-minded saint, but
as an honourable man, certainly not unaware of the seamier side
of life, though of course absolutely untouched by it himself, and
unselfishly devoted to his friends. Brassington, I suppose, was
one of his oldest friends, if not his best. Lady Summers herself
once told me how well they had always got on together. And so on
this particular evening it was quite natural that after dinner
the two of them should forgather over their liqueurs for an
intimate chat.</p>

<p>"Archie, it seemed, was bound ultimately for a long stay in
Egypt, where his brother was stationed. They were going slowly
eastwards. And then when he asked for details of his friend's
travels, it seemed to Brassington that here was an admirable
opportunity for unburdening himself.</p>

<p>"'I've a mighty queer story to tell you, Archie,' he said.</p>

<p>"'Fire away.'</p>

<p>"'But you may&mdash;&mdash;' Brassington hesitated. A moment
before, it had seemed simple to tell his friend of the strange
affair of the card, but now there crossed his mind the
possibility that even Archie Summers might find something
sinister in the business. 'It's very silly of me,' he continued,
'but I've had rather a shock, rather a bad shock, to tell you the
truth.'</p>

<p>"Archie showed his solicitude. 'Why, man, you look upset
now.'</p>

<p>"'I am,' admitted Brassington. 'It's quite
absurd&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Have another brandy and tell me the yarn,' suggested Archie
Summers, and they filled up their glasses.</p>

<p>"And then Brassington gave a plain account of what had
occurred. He looked sharply at his friend as he finished and was
enormously relieved to see him laughing outright.</p>

<p>"'It strikes me you must have been doing yourself very well,
old man.'</p>

<p>"'You don't believe me?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, certainly I do. I believe you've been locked up and all
the rest of it, but I can't believe that half-a-dozen words on a
card caused all the trouble.'</p>

<p>"'I might,' continued Brassington, nervous again, 'show you
the card.'</p>

<p>"'Do, by all means,' laughed the other, 'but if you expect me
to be disgusted and horrified and angry, you're quite
mistaken.'</p>

<p>"'You swear that?'</p>

<p>"'Swear? Good God, man, what's come over you? Some damned
nonsense on a card&mdash;what on earth is there to swear about?
You don't think a few words could turn me into a raging lunatic
ready to stab an old pal or send him to jail?'</p>

<p>"'No, old man, but somehow&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Show me the card,' said Archie Summers, laughing again, 'and
if I can, I'll translate it for you. I'm not bad at languages.
And if it's very awful,' he added with mock seriousness, 'mum's
the word.'</p>

<p>"In silence Brassington handed over the card. Archie Summers
glanced almost carelessly at it, and for a moment it looked as if
the spell had been broken. Then he saw that Summers had gone very
white. He had got up from his chair and was pacing excitedly up
and down the room. He did not look at Brassington. For a while he
was angrily muttering to himself, and Brassington watched him as
some wretched bird might watch a snake. Then came words which he
could not easily forget.</p>

<p>"'You'll have to resign,' said Archie Summers in a queer
strained voice. 'Your clubs, I mean. At once. We have been
friends, I know, and I shall say nothing myself. Nothing. That
goes without saying, but if you ever dare to show your face again
in decent society, I'll&mdash;And my wife here too!' He had
turned now towards the wretched man. 'How <i>dare</i> you,
Brassington,' he shouted. 'My God, if I'd ever thought....' He
couldn't say any more, but threw down the card and rushed from
the room.</p>

<p>"Half an hour later the very polite hotel-keeper was
regretting the fact that the signor's room would be wanted the
next day. An old customer...."</p>

<p>"He seems to have got almost as far south as Messina, but
could tell me little enough about that time. There was no
mistaking the menace of Archie Summers's words, and as he worried
and groped, his fears increased. He began to imagine things. His
thoughts became stranger and stranger. He found himself afraid to
go to bed. Fearsome dreams would cause him to wake up in an agony
of fear. And then he noticed that he was making excuses to
himself for not going out into the streets. Once he tried to
write a letter to D'Anoury, but could find no words.</p>

<p>"There came, you will understand, a general nervous
breakdown.</p>

<p>"And still the card reposed in his case.... though Brassington
could no longer bring himself to look at it. Once or twice he
felt minded to fling it away, but always something came to
prevent him. But no longer did he particularly wish to have its
meaning explained to him. A heavy languor was setting upon him.
And little gaps appeared in his memory. It seemed to him that he
would remain, for all time unnoticed and alone, in this corner of
Italy.</p>

<p>"Then one night he had a bad fright. I'm not quite clear as to
what happened. Possibly he had some sort of fit&mdash;what the
doctors call the night-terrors in children&mdash;and in the
morning he felt so ill that he was unable to leave his bed. He
was staying in a little farmhouse now, and for some weeks he lay
there, tended very lovingly by the farm-people. The local doctor
visited him and could find nothing organically wrong. He gave one
piece of good advice. The Englishman ought certainly to return to
England to consult his own physician.</p>

<p>"For some time Brassington debated that admirable suggestion.
The whole thing, he tried to think, might be nerves. Why not rush
home to see Aylmer? He need not even mention the card. No one
need know he had returned to England, and if necessary he could
recross the Channel almost at once. And so, one day, he took his
courage in his hands and came home.</p>

<p>"I don't know Dr. Aylmer myself, but I've always heard that
he's a first-class man. Neurologist at Guy's for some years, and
now in Harley Street. Brassington hired him from Dover, asking
for an immediate appointment. Luckily Aylmer was at home and saw
him at once. He was shocked at the change in Brassington's
appearance. Told him he looked like a haunted man and wanted to
know what frightful concoctions he had been trying to eat. I
gather that Brassington himself was so exhausted that for some
time he could hardly speak. The doctor was seriously worried, and
soon diagnosed one of those distressing phobias which seem to be
so common to-day.</p>

<p>"'Just tell me everything quite slowly and coolly,' he said,
'and when you come to the unpleasant parts, remember I'm a doctor
who hasn't been shocked since Derby Day of 1896.'</p>

<p>"And Brassington somehow managed to tell his story. To his
surprise there was no detail which seemed to cause Dr. Aylmer any
astonishment at all: he just listened and occasionally nodded his
head.</p>

<p>"His attitude was undoubtedly the right one, for Brassington
seemed no little relieved.</p>

<p>"'You've been through a considerable strain, you see, Lord
Brassington,' he told him. 'We shall have to go thoroughly into
the whole matter. Probably I have heard only half at the moment.
So far as I can see, your unfortunate adventures have somehow
grouped themselves round some words on a card. Very well, the
first thing to do is to solve the mystery of those words. I am
particularly interested in such things. Let me see it.'</p>

<p>"'But that's the one thing, Doctor, that I don't feel I have
courage enough to do.'</p>

<p>"Aylmer smiled. 'The doctor's consulting-room....' he
began.</p>

<p>"'Oh, I know, I know, but what can I think when Archie
Summers, one of my oldest friends....'</p>

<p>"'Shall I tell you what I think, Lord Brassington? I think
that on the evening when you met Sir Archibald you were not at
all well.'</p>

<p>"Brassington put up a hand to his forehead. 'I sometimes do
forget things,' he muttered, 'but I swear I remember every
incident of that evening.'</p>

<p>"'No doubt,' agreed Aylmer, 'Just give me the card, then, and
we'll see what can be done.'</p>

<p>"Brassington was painfully hesitating.</p>

<p>"'I believe you can't even trust your own doctor,' said
Aylmer, laughing. 'You ought to know by this time that a doctor
is accustomed to hear many things which the average layman
doesn't usually speak about.'</p>

<p>"'I know, I know, but you see, if you fail me....'</p>

<p>"'My dear sir, there is not a chance I shall fail you, for the
simple reason that I'm almost positive I have already solved the
mystery.'</p>

<p>"'You believe....'</p>

<p>"'Show me the card, and I promise that not a human soul shall
be told anything about it.'</p>

<p>"'Your word of honour?'</p>

<p>"'My word of honour.'</p>

<p>"Brassington took out his card-case.</p>

<p>"'Here it is,' he said, and held out the card.</p>

<p>"The doctor took it up and examined it carefully. He turned it
over and held it up to the light.</p>

<p>"Then he smiled. 'Exactly what I expected to find,' he
said.</p>

<p>"'You mean.... I....' Brassington sat down and stared at him.
'I don't understand....'</p>

<p>"'<i>There is nothing on the card</i>,' said Dr. Aylmer. 'Both
sides are quite blank.'"</p>

<p>"But," I exclaimed, "I don't understand either. There must
have been something...."?</p>

<p>"I told you," said John Chester, "that this was the most
maddening story in the world, and you mustn't ask me any more
questions. I can only tell you that when the doctor saw the card
it was blank, but whether it had always been
blank&mdash;&mdash;-Hullo, the old General has obtained his
drink! Waiter, you may bring us two whiskies-and-sodas."</p>
