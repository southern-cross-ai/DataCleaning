<h3><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h3>

<p>Her name is Kyra Sokratesco. She is a
Roumanian&mdash;<i>petite</i>, and rather lovely. And unkind
people on the C&ocirc;te des Maures, which lies west of the more
civilised French Riviera, are apt to call her "Gilbert's girl
friend." The Chief of the Secret Police of Toulon, however, knows
better; and it was at his instigation, with my wife's full
cognisance, that Kyra and I spent a day and a night in our Local
Assize Town&mdash;and disagreed all the time.</p>

<p>"Camille Oustric is innocent," began I, as soon as we reached
Draguignan. "He acted in self-defence."</p>

<p>"Camille Oustric is a hired bully and a cold-blooded
assassin," began she. "If this were England he, and others with
him, would hang."</p>

<p>Our friend of the Secret Police of Toulon said, "I feel with
you, mademoiselle. But where is there proof for a court?"</p>

<p>The court at Draguignan is not impressive&mdash;bare walls,
bare wood, a dais for the Procureur de la R&eacute;publique and
the three judges, a box with twelve arm-chairs for the jury, a
<i>banc</i> and a <i>barreau</i> for the witnesses, another
<i>banc</i> for the accused.</p>

<p>When Kyra and I entered the Court-room, the accused was
already seated between two gendarmes. He resembled his pictures
in the newspapers&mdash;a powerfully-built man in his forties,
sailorish, with a high dome of bald forehead, big cheekbones, and
an immense brown moustache.</p>

<p>"His eyebrows twitch," observed Kyra, as we took our places in
the Press-box. "He is frightened."</p>

<p>"So would you be," I retorted. "Twenty years' penal servitude
in French Guiana is worse than death."</p>

<p>We continued sparring&mdash;while Counsel for the Defence,
little and moustachioed, shook hands with his client; while
Counsel for the Partie Civile (the relatives of the victim, who
claim damages for his murder) big and bearded, was arranging his
<i>dossier</i>; and while the <i>Greffier</i> called over the
jury-roll. Even the tinny bell and the "<i>Messieurs, la
Cour</i>," which heralded the entrance of the red-robed "Monsieur
le Pr&eacute;sident," his two brother judges, and the Procureur
de la R&eacute;publique, bald and clean-shaven, only reduced us
to whispers, until the jury had been sworn.</p>

<p>For our disagreement had been of long standing&mdash;ever
since the first report of the case.</p>

<h5>* * * * *</h5>

<p>The case, as the jury now heard it from the charge-sheet, was
rather sordid, but seemed of the simplest. Camille Oustric, owner
of a grocer's shop, had shot his brother-in-law, Josef
Castelvetri, a <i>sous-officier</i> in the French Navy, on the
night of the eleventh September at the Villa Fleurie in Toulon.
Two witnesses&mdash;Oustric's sister, and his sister's
fifteen-year-old boy&mdash;had witnessed the whole of the
shooting. His sister's lover, who owned the villa, had seen the
beginning of it. Oustric himself confessed to it&mdash;pleading,
a plea confirmed by all three witnesses, Self-Defence.</p>

<p>"Tell your story," said the President, after the charge had
been read over; "and please speak up."</p>

<p>"It was like this," said Oustric, rising, and his robust voice
carried conviction. "On the night he died my brother-in-law
should have come to us before dinner. We waited until nine
o'clock for him&mdash;his wife, my sister; his son Jacques;
Monsieur de Borneville, and I. At nine we dined on the veranda.
At ten there came a loud knocking on the outside door. I told
Jacques to answer the door. He went. A moment later he staggered
back, bleeding from a blow on the forehead. 'Papa has killed me,'
he cried. My brother-in-law followed. He had a pistol in his
hand. 'Woman, I will stand this dishonour no longer,' he shouted.
Then he fired twice. My sister fell wounded. Monsieur de
Borneville jumped from the veranda. Thinking he would fire again,
I rushed at Josef; I caught his wrists. 'For God's sake!' I
implored. But he was mad, Monsieur. He fired again&mdash;at me;
and the bullet pierced the ceiling. I remembered, then, that my
sister had a pistol. It was in a drawer of her writing-table.
Before he could fire a fourth shot I was at the writing-table. I
wrenched the drawer open. I seized my sister's pistol. I emptied
it at him. God forgive me for doing it&mdash;but Josef would have
killed her. What else could I do?"</p>

<p>"And do <i>you</i> believe that rigmarole," whispered
Kyra.</p>

<p>"I do," said I. "Or at any rate the essentials of it. The
woman was in danger of her life. He defended her."</p>

<p>To which Kyra retorted with the Roumanian equivalent of
"Pah!"</p>

<p>The President, however, though he examined at great length,
did not succeed in shaking the prisoner's testimony.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Oustric in effect, "I admit that I knew of my
sister's relations with Monsieur de Borneville; I admit that
Monsieur de Borneville took me to the villa that evening; I admit
that I went there to protect my sister should her husband become
violent. But I was unarmed. I had no intention of killing. And
the thing happened exactly as I have said."</p>

<p>"You say you were unarmed?" was the President's last question.
"Yet it has been proved that you possessed a pistol."</p>

<p>"Not a pistol, Monsieur. Only a very old revolver, which
Monsieur le Chef de la S&ucirc;ret&eacute; found where I told him
he would find it, under the counter of my shop."</p>

<p>When Oustric sat down on his <i>banc</i>, while a doctor, pure
Dickens from the cut of his old-fashioned coat to the set of his
old-fashioned spectacles, came pawkily to the wooden rail of the
witnesses, I couldn't help being a little sorry for the Chef de
la S&ucirc;ret&eacute;. And the medical evidence made me sorrier
still. For after describing Castelvetri's three wounds at length,
our Dickensian doctor detailed his examination of Madame
Castelvetri, who had been shot, "In the right thigh, gentlemen of
the jury; a clean wound at close range; the bullet entering five
centimetres higher than its point of exit"&mdash;a fact which had
hitherto been in dispute.</p>

<p>"<i>Tu entends, ma ch&egrave;re</i>" I whispered, "that blows
our friend's theory of her having been hit by a ricochet to
atoms."</p>

<p>"I admit it," whispered back Kyra. "But his theory is not
mine."</p>

<p>The next evidence, read by the Procureur de la
R&eacute;publique, was new to both of us&mdash;but failed, in my
opinion, to throw much light on the case. An architect named
Meyrowitz, whose house was eighty yards away from the villa, had
heard the shooting&mdash;first one shot; then, after a short
interval, a second; then a positive fusillade. This witness had
also heard de Borneville run past his window, and a woman's voice
calling after him, "Marcel! Marcel! Come back."</p>

<p>Kyra, I may say, seemed to think this deposition of some
importance. She smiled to herself as she made a note of it; and
nodded to our friend the Chef de la S&ucirc;ret&eacute; just
before he took oath at the bar.</p>

<p>"At five-thirty a.m. on the morning of the eleventh
September," said our friend, "I was called to the Toulon
Hospital. A man had been shot. He wished to make a special
deposition. So I went at once. When I got there the man, Josef
Castelvetri, was on the point of death. He signed his deposition,
however, which is as follows: 'It was my fault. I was mad. I
wounded her. Then Camille shot me.'"</p>

<p>"And after that?" prompted the President.</p>

<p>"After that I rang up the City Police, and told them to make
full inquiries at the Villa Fleurie, from which&mdash;the
ambulance driver told me&mdash;the man had been brought in."</p>

<p>"The City Police will tell us the rest, I presume?"</p>

<p>"<i>Oui, Monsieur le Pr&eacute;sident, oui</i>."</p>

<p>Our friend, who never appears personally either for or against
a prisoner unless, as in this case, circumstances force him to,
retired without glancing at us; and a rather foolish-looking City
policeman took his place.</p>

<p>The police, it appeared, had gone to the Villa Fleurie
immediately on receipt of our friend's telephone
message&mdash;but not alone. With them had gone the accused, who
had already given himself up and made his confession, and the
three principal witnesses, who had reported at the police-station
at the same time. At the villa, everything&mdash;including a
bullet-hole in the ceiling&mdash;had confirmed the accused's
statement. Both pistols had been left on the dining-table.</p>

<p>"Both of them were seven-shot Brownings," said the City
policeman. "Six-point-thirty-five millimetres. Both had been
recently fired. One, manufactured at Herbstahl in Belgium,
contained three cartridges in the magazine and one in the
chamber. This, I was told, had belonged to the victim. The other,
marked M.A.B., of French make, belonged, as she admitted, to the
woman, and was empty. That is all I know."</p>

<p>But a second policeman, carrying the tale a step further,
brought out the one point which&mdash;as I had always
admitted&mdash;was against the accused.</p>

<p>"Acting on instruction," said this second policeman, "I
proceeded to the hospital and examined the clothes of the victim.
In the pockets I found twenty-nine francs and a few centimes, a
watch, a pocket-handkerchief, seventeen six-point-thirty-five
millimetre cartridges, and a magazine for a Browning pistol."</p>

<p>"And the mark on that magazine?" asked the Procureur de la
R&eacute;publique, who had hitherto foregone his right to
examine.</p>

<p>"The mark on the magazine, Monsieur, was M.A.B."</p>

<h5>* * * * *</h5>

<p>Since my acquaintance with Kyra and her friend of the
S&ucirc;ret&eacute;, who has particularly requested that I should
not describe him, I have witnessed many "scenes" in French Law
Courts. But rarely such a one as now occurred between Monsieur le
Procureur and Counsel for the Defence.</p>

<p>"I protest," screamed Counsel for the Defence, rising. "And I
shall continue to protest. This evidence is trivial. It can have
no bearing on the issue. The Herbstahl and the M.A.B. pistol are
absolutely identical. The same magazines, the same cartridges fit
either of them."</p>

<p>"Quite so," screamed back the Procureur. "We admit it. That,
we say, is how your client made his mistake."</p>

<p>"Mistake! But it is you, Monsieur le Procureur, who make a
mistake when you try, as the Juge d'Instruction tried, to
prejudice an innocent man, my unfortunate
client&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," interrupted the President,
"gentlemen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the President's interruption went unheeded&mdash;till his
bell rang for the "suspension of debates."</p>

<p>During this suspension Kyra fell into one of those moods which
I can only describe as "Kyraish," her lovely eyes half-closed,
her lips pursed, one thin little hand drawing idle designs in her
notebook&mdash;and I, still more or less convinced of Oustric's
innocence, went out to have a cigarette.</p>

<p>Our friend of the S&ucirc;ret&eacute; was outside; and I
condoled with him a little. He replied, "If Mademoiselle does not
aid us, I fear this villain, and also his accomplices, will go
free."</p>

<p>When I came back, the Court seemed much fuller; Messieurs les
Avocats had apparently made up their differences; and a third
policeman, a Commissioner, stood at the bar saying: "Yes,
Monsieur. When the accused came to my office on the morning of
the twelfth September, I took all four statements separately. I
noticed nothing peculiar about any of the four people except that
Monsieur de Borneville had a bruise, caused, as he said, by
striking himself against the hood of his motor-car, on the bridge
of his nose."</p>

<p>Two gunsmiths, contradicting one another, as all expert
witnesses in all countries, followed the Commissioner. Both,
however, questioned by the Defence, "If a customer purchases a
six-point-thirty-five millimetre Herbstahl pistol and asks for a
spare magazine with it, is he not as liable to be supplied with
an M.A.B. magazine as a Herbstahl?" answered, "Yes. That is so.
The magazines are interchangeable."</p>

<p>At which Kyra frowned.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h3>

<p>Kyra was still frowning while we took our luncheon; and with
her, too, I condoled a little, for being
over-imaginative&mdash;as indeed she is.</p>

<p>"There is no mystery in this case," I told her. "It is all
perfectly straightforward."</p>

<p>She said, quietly, "My friend, no case with a strong
sex-motive behind it is absolutely straightforward. I am a
woman&mdash;and I know."</p>

<p>At twenty minutes past two the judges' guard of soldiers came
marching by us; by half-past we were again in Court. The Court
was fuller than ever. Looking back over my shoulder at the crowd
pressing to the rails behind us, I was reminded of the French
Revolution&mdash;as reconstructed by the American film. But the
crowd stood orderly, and only the tiniest shiver of anticipation
ran through it when de Borneville, giving Kyra a glance as he
passed the Press-box, came to the bar.</p>

<p>A highly-strung little man, I judged de Borneville. He had the
long nose of the aristocrat, the "tooth-brush" moustache of an
English officer, and curiously soft, rather imaginative brown
eyes. He gave his age as thirty-nine, unmarried; his profession
as "landowner"; took the oath calmly, and turned to the jury at
once.</p>

<p>"Before I make my deposition," he began, "I want to assure
you, gentlemen of the jury, of my deep regret at having been the
unwilling cause of this tragedy. Also of my
determination&mdash;once I am assured that Camille Oustric is
found innocent&mdash;of compensating the Castelvetri family for
the bereavement which they have suffered&mdash;as, indeed, I
would have done already had they not brought suit against the
accused."</p>

<p>"<i>Quelle blague</i>," whispered Kyra. But I could see that
de Borneville had impressed the jury; and the favourable
impression deepened as he went calmly on.</p>

<p>His relations with the woman he admitted frankly, making no
excuse for himself. "What would you? We are all human. Despite
the difference in our position, I loved her. I still love her. We
should have married had not her husband been an ardent Catholic;
had he not refused to grant her, as most men would have done, a
divorce."</p>

<p>"During the two years you and his wife lived together,"
interrupted the President, "you had often asked Castelvetri to
divorce her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, often. Whenever he came home from a cruise."</p>

<p>"He came home from a cruise on the tenth of September, and the
purpose of your meeting on the night of the eleventh was to
discuss the same topic?"</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"And because you were afraid Castelvetri might become violent,
you took Oustric with you?"</p>

<p>"That is so. I am, as you will see, by no means a Hercules."
And de Borneville looked towards the foreman of the jury, who
smiled.</p>

<p>After that he described the start of the actual shooting,
telling the same story as Oustric, quietly, but this time making
an excuse for himself. "I ran away after the first shot," he
admitted. "It looks cowardly, I know, but I fancied that
Castelvetri would follow&mdash;that I would draw his fire."</p>

<p>"You ran for help?" suggested the President. "That hardly
bears out what you have just told us."</p>

<p>"I only ran for help after I heard the fusillade, after I
guessed that a tragedy must have happened. It seemed to me that
the sooner I got some independent witness the better. As soon as
I had secured that witness, I jumped into my car; I drove for the
doctor, for the ambulance. At six o'clock I reported myself to
the police."</p>

<p>De Borneville, under the President's examination, under that
of the Partie Civile and the Procureur, remained imperturbable.
The impression he continued to give was that of a man in the most
cruel of difficulties, behaving in the correctest way. When
asked, "Was Oustric armed when you took him to the villa?" he
retorted instantly: "Had I thought arms necessary, there would
have been no need for Oustric. In the war I was not quite unused
to firearms. I could have carried a pistol myself."</p>

<p>Only once, or so it seemed to me, did he display any
hesitancy, and that at the Procureur's question: "We have been
told that Castelvetri, just before he fired, shouted: 'Woman, I
will stand this dishonour no longer.' Do you confirm that, or
not?"</p>

<p>"It may have been so," said de Borneville then. "He certainly
said something. But of the actual words I have no recollection.
And I do not think he shouted. I would rather describe it that he
hissed."</p>

<p>Asked, "Were you not amazed that Castelvetri should have
struck his own son?" he answered: "No. The son had always sided
with his mother, you see"; and shortly after retired to the
<i>banc</i>.</p>

<p>"The clever devil!" whispered Kyra, watching him; and in a
minute or so the woman stood at the bar.</p>

<p>She was dressed in black, fairly fashionably. A tall creature,
dark-haired and slim of figure, with long, expressive hands. Her
eyes were big, and held something of fear in them. But her voice,
as she gave her age, "Thirty-seven," sounded clear, self-certain,
and somehow sweet.</p>

<p>"As the victim's widow," explained the President, "this woman
cannot give sworn testimony. But she has volunteered a statement,
and she can be interrogated on it. Madame, you may now
proceed."</p>

<h5>* * * * *</h5>

<p>The widow's statement tallied, to a nicety, with Oustric's and
de Borneville's. Examination revealed no flaws in it. Only at the
end were the spectators&mdash;Kyra and I, of course, were
prepared for it&mdash;treated to a surprise.</p>

<p>"In view of what you have just told us," said the President,
"how comes it that you told one witness, 'I did it. I killed my
husband'? And how comes it that your son told the same witness
almost the same thing?"</p>

<p>"I can explain that very easily," the woman answered. "Indeed,
I have done so twice already. As the moral culprit, it was my
intention to take this crime on my own shoulders. I wanted to
save my brother. Therefore, I told my son&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To lie, madame?"</p>

<p>"To lie in what I thought a good cause, Monsieur le
Pr&eacute;sident."</p>

<p>"But your son had seen everything?"</p>

<p>"Oui."</p>

<p>"You persist in that? It is claimed, you know, that he told
another witness, at his father's funeral, 'I saw nothing. I was
not in the veranda. I was outside the door.'"</p>

<p>"Jacques saw everything," asseverated the woman. "The
suggestion that he was not in the veranda is mere gossip."</p>

<p>"That," retorted the President, "we shall see."</p>

<p>A little later, after only one admission, secured by the
Partie Civile, "Yes. I called at my brother's shop to buy my
usual provisions on the morning of the eleventh," that seemed to
me in any way pertinent, the woman joined her lover on the bench
of the witnesses, and her son, Castelvetri's orphan, came in.</p>

<p>"He, too," said the President, "cannot give sworn testimony."
And I saw Kyra's eyebrows go up as the boy began.</p>

<p>The boy, very strong, dark-haired, stocky of figure,
dark-eyed, but not, or so I thought, over-intelligent, made his
deposition stoutly. His father had hit him with his pistol-butt.
He had seen his father shoot at his mother: seen his uncle
struggling with his father; seen his uncle snatch the pistol from
the drawer. When he had finished this deposition the President
again "suspended the debates."</p>

<p>"Very unusual before his own examination," I commented to
Kyra.</p>

<p>"Very," admitted Kyra. "I suspect our friend's hand in it.
However, we shall see."</p>

<p>We saw our friend's hand, and could not help chuckling a
little at the subtlety of him, when the bell rang, and the
President, full of apologies, turned to the jury saying,
"Gentlemen, I am very sorry. I made a mistake. A dead man's son
or daughter can give sworn testimony, either for or against his
murderer. I am therefore going to ask this witness to repeat what
he has just told you. But this time on oath."</p>

<p>And when Jacques Castelvetri repeated his second deposition on
oath, it tallied&mdash;word for word, as a hidden shorthand
writer proved to us that evening&mdash;with his first!</p>

<p>"<i>Tu entends, mon cher</i>," whispered Kyra triumphantly;
and I, "Supposing he did learn his statement by heart, it proves
nothing." Nor did the threefold examination prove very much
more.</p>

<p>"I said mother had done it because mother told me to,"
admitted Jacques Gastelvetri.</p>

<p>"Then you lied?"</p>

<p>"Yes. To save uncle."</p>

<p>"And there is a witness who maintains you told him, 'I saw
nothing.'"</p>

<p>"Never, Monsieur le Procureur."</p>

<p>"You are on your oath."</p>

<p>"On my oath, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"You maintain that?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>The boy, his tale told, went to his mother. He took her hand;
held it. The woman was crying a little. He tried to comfort her.
De Borneville moved along the bench towards them, thought better
of it, moved away.</p>

<p>I called Kyra's attention to the humanity of the picture they
made. She whispered, "Yes. They are great actors," as the next,
perhaps the all-important, witness came in.</p>

<p>"My name is Henri Piquart, and I am in the Octroi," said that
witness, a hefty, clean-shaven youngster, with the manner of the
minor French official. "The Octroi (Town Customs) Station is
about a quarter of a mile from the Villa Fleurie. At about
ten-fifteen on the night of September the eleventh Monsieur de
Borneville, who was unknown to me, rushed in. There had been
<i>une bagarre</i>, he told me. He could find no policeman; would
I come at once? I went with Monsieur de Borneville, but only
after he had proved his identity to me. When we reached his
villa, a boy ran out to us, crying, 'He is dead. Mother has
killed him.' De Borneville said, 'Not your mother. Surely not
your mother.' The boy answered, 'Yes. Yes. Mother.' Then we went
in."</p>

<p>The man from the Octroi described the scene&mdash;Castelvetri
on his back, his wife bleeding, Oustric with a bandage, trying to
stanch her wound.</p>

<p>"We saw that the man was not yet dead," he went on. "De
Borneville, who seemed very frightened, said, 'I have my car
here. I will go for the doctor, for the ambulance.' He took the
boy with him. And I remained."</p>

<p>"At de Borneville's suggestion?" interrupted the
President.</p>

<p>"Yes. After he had gone, Castelvetri seemed about to recover
consciousness. I sent Camille Oustric to get water for him. While
he was away, the woman said to me, 'I will tell you how it
happened. I shot him. It was an accident. All the shots in the
pistol seemed to go off at once.' Castelvetri was muttering
something then; and Oustric had come back with the water. Oustric
said, 'Do not believe her. I did it.' When I gave Castelvetri the
water, he opened his eyes and muttered, 'Camille, you have killed
me.' Castelvetri seemed in great pain. I did what I could for
him. But it was difficult, because of the woman. She seemed quite
beside herself. I gathered that there must have been some
terrible quarrel. She kept on flinging herself down by her
husband, and reproaching him&mdash;about some other woman. This
went on all the time till de Borneville returned with the doctor.
I was very tired by then. I thought I had done my duty. And after
giving my name to de Borneville, I went away."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h3>

<p>"If that is the whole case for the prosecution," said I, some
hours later, "it fails."</p>

<p>We were sitting, I must admit, in Kyra's bedroom&mdash;she on
the edge of the bed, legs crossed, a cigarette between her
fingers; I close to her, a brandy-and-soda at my side.
Unfortunately for the unkind ones, however, there was a third
party present&mdash;our friend of the Secret Police.</p>

<p>"We have other evidence for to-morrow," said he. "But only
circumstantial. Our main witness, the one who overheard the boy
say, 'I saw nothing,' has sent a doctor's certificate to say he
is not well enough to attend. All we can actually prove is that
Oustric occasionally carried a pistol."</p>

<p>"A pistol," interrupted Kyra, "or a revolver?"</p>

<p>"Among the lower orders in France, mademoiselle, the terms are
unfortunately synonymous."</p>

<p>"I know. It is a pity. And de Borneville's payments to
Oustric?"</p>

<p>"He has always admitted that he financed Oustric's grocery
shop."</p>

<p>"He admits everything, that devil."</p>

<p>"Except his complicity in the death of Castelvetri."</p>

<p>"His complicity. And the woman's. She visited her brother that
morning. Obviously to arrange the crime."</p>

<p>"But if it was no crime?" I interrupted. "If it all happened
as they say it did?"</p>

<p>"In that case," Kyra flashed at me, "the wrong magazine would
not have been in the dead man's pocket; there would have been no
statement, 'I shot him; it was an accident,' from the woman;
there would have been no bruise on de Borneville's nose; the
boy's evidence would not have been word-perfect&mdash;and de
Borneville would have been at the police-station several hours,
three at any rate, before six o'clock.</p>

<p>"And besides," she went on, "their story, though plausible, is
slightly ridiculous. How could Oustric have wrenched the drawer
open to get at the pistol? The moment he let go of Castelvetri he
would have been shot down. And then there is Meyrowitz, who heard
the woman cry, 'Marcel, come back'; but never heard the loud
knock or the boy's 'Papa has killed me.' or Castelvetri's 'Woman,
I will stand this dishonour no longer.'</p>

<p>"And what of Castelvetri's mental state before he went to the
villa?" She turned to our friend. "Have you no evidence on that
point? Somebody must have seen him, spoken with him?"</p>

<p>"Only his father. And his father is the Partie Civile. He can
give no evidence. Castelvetri, it appears, was always very
reticent about the whole position."</p>

<p>"Didn't he say anything to his father?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of importance&mdash;except that he had an appointment
with de Borneville, who was still bothering him about the
divorce."</p>

<p>"Castelvetri did not mean to grant the divorce, then?"</p>

<p>"No, mademoiselle. He was far too devout. And, as you know,
the last man in the world to contemplate
violence&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yet he shot his wife in the leg," I interrupted.</p>

<p>"I refuse to believe it," snapped Kyra.</p>

<p>"Then who did shoot her? De Borneville? Oustric? Her own son,
perhaps? Dash it all, her husband himself admitted, on his
death-bed, and to our friend here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Castelvetri's deposition," said Kyra, "merely proves him a
gentleman&mdash;and that he died loving his wife."</p>

<p>In all the detective stories I have ever read&mdash;and I have
read many, mostly to please her, since my acquaintance with
Kyra&mdash;the narrator is made out a half-wit. And as such I, of
all people, was treated during the next half-hour. Kyra and her
pet policeman simply left me out of their discussion&mdash;while
they pored over plans and photographs of the veranda dining-room,
over the two pistols and the ten used cartridge cases, and the
whole common-or-garden paraphernalia of their trade.</p>

<p>"You're wasting your time," I said at last&mdash;and, I fear,
irritably. "Granted all the flaws in the story&mdash;and I can
see them as well as you can&mdash;it will be good enough for the
jury. The woman's evidence is unshaken; the boy's also. And your
Juge d'Instruction, when he made his original inquiry, must have
been a perfect fool."</p>

<p>"In what way?" queried our friend, with his usual
politeness.</p>

<p>"<i>Eh bien</i>," said I; "Jacques says, they all say, that
his father hit him with his pistol-butt; that he staggered in
bleeding. A blow like that would have left a
scar&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It did," retorted our friend. "The Juge d'Instruction had it
examined by a doctor. It was a superficial head wound, not
serious, but such as might easily cause profuse
bleeding&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And such as might have been inflicted by a pistol-butt?"</p>

<p>"Quite possibly. Since it was under the hair."</p>

<p>A silence followed; and in that silence I looked at Kyra,
still smoking, legs crossed, on her bed.</p>

<p>"You're very clever, Gilbert," she said at last. "Almost as
clever as de Borneville. But you can't get over the fact that he
had eight hours to concoct this story&mdash;and that it was
supremely in the interest of all of them that Castelvetri should
die."</p>

<p>"Not in the boy's," I protested. "Not in Oustric's."</p>

<p>"In theirs too. Financially. De Borneville is a rich man,
remember."</p>

<p>"You make the boy out a monster, Kyra."</p>

<p>"The boy still thinks his mother did it. He thinks he is lying
to save both her and his uncle. That is why he lies so well."</p>

<p>Another silence followed&mdash;with our friend fingering his
copy of the <i>dossier</i>, and Kyra at her most Kyraish, a
picture of applied concentration, cigarette extinguished, eyes
closed.</p>

<p>"De Borneville's war record?" she asked, when her eyes opened.
"You say it is a good one. About how good? Was he ever
wounded?"</p>

<p>"Never." Our friend's eyes were on the <i>dossier</i>.
"Towards the end he had a touch of shell-shock, and got three
months' leave for it. But he returned to duty and was promoted
Major for conspicuous coolness and ingenuity during a night raid,
almost single-handed, into the enemy's lines."</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Kyra. "That helps."</p>

<p>She closed her eyes again, and sat back for a long time,
apparently dreaming. Then she said, "Shell-shock! That explains
his bolting. He must have got his nerve back rather quickly. Yet
he lost it again, according to Piquart, when the boy said,
'Mother has killed him.' She lost her nerve, too. And so did
Oustric. There was no need to empty the whole pistol. Or to plant
all those cartridges. I wonder if we dare try it? One could in
Roumania. But here! Here!"</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h3><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV</h3>

<p>Both as a law-abiding English citizen and as a friend of
France, whose justice in the main is also equitable, I experience
a certain diffidence in relating the events of the next hour.</p>

<p>Our friend, when Kyra first broached her plan to him, would
have none of it. "It is impossible," he said. "Impossible. Even
by the S&ucirc;ret&eacute;, it could not be done."</p>

<p>"But he is sleeping in this very hotel," protested Kyra. "I
have only to send a note along the corridor."</p>

<p>"He will not come for your note."</p>

<p>"He will&mdash;if he is guilty." And in the end, after long
argument, Kyra got her way.</p>

<p>She showed us her note before she rang for the waiter; and
though my sense of fair-play revolted, I had to admit the thing a
masterpiece. "All is known," it read. "To-morrow, when the Court
opens, you and she will be arrested. The S&ucirc;ret&eacute; is
watching. Do not try to find me. Be careful.&mdash;A <span class=
"smcap">Friend</span>."</p>

<p>Before she rang for the waiter, too, she made us hide
ourselves; so that it was half-stifled in a slip of a bathroom
that I heard her say: "For the gentleman in twenty-eight,
<i>gar&ccedil;on</i>. You are to wait until you see him open it.
If he asks you from whom it comes, you are to say nothing. When
you have delivered the letter, return here."</p>

<p>"Subtle," whispered our friend. "It is a thousand to one he
will follow the waiter." And a moment later Kyra turned out her
bedroom light.</p>

<p>We waited breathless&mdash;and both nervous. We heard the
waiter come back; heard Kyra say, sleepily, "<i>Merci. C'est
bon</i>. My <i>petit d&eacute;jeuner</i> at eight-thirty,
please," and about five minutes later, a cautious knock.</p>

<p>Kyra did not answer that knock; and after an interval it
repeated itself. At the third repetition she called out, as one
startled: "Who is it? Who is it?" and we heard her run to the
door.</p>

<p>She gave a tiny cry as she opened the door; and presently we
heard her say, "But this is madness. Madness. They are watching
you." Then the door closed, and we knew that de Borneville was
inside the darkened room.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked, and from the tone his teeth must have
been chattering.</p>

<p>"A friend. I told you. But it is folly&mdash;folly what you
have just done."</p>

<p>"Folly or not, I am here. All is known, you wrote. What is
known? Tell me. I insist."</p>

<p>"Enough is known. You are betrayed. The S&ucirc;ret&eacute;
has evidence that Oustric habitually carried a pistol, not a
revolver. They have evidence, too, that the old revolver under
the shop counter was not his, but yours."</p>

<p>I am, as I protest, no half-wit. Nor did it take me more than
a few seconds to follow the line Kyra was adopting for her
totally illegal experiment in the Third Degree. If the revolver
was de Borneville's, and the woman admitted owning one pistol,
and Oustric could be proved to have been in the habit of carrying
another ... Yet, even so, I was not prepared for de Borneville's
gasp.</p>

<p>He gasped, after Kyra had spoken those two deadly sentences,
exactly as I once heard a man gasp when the point of a bayonet
took him in the vitals, "Ah! Ah!" with a gurgle in the throat.
Imaginatively I saw him sway&mdash;and in a second Kyra drove at
him again.</p>

<p>"They can prove Castelvetri was unarmed," she drove at
him.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Again the gurgle.</p>

<p>"And that the three of you had planned to murder him. They
know the truth about Jacques's wound, and about <i>hers</i>, and
about Castelvetri's dying deposition. They know everything,
Monsieur de Borneville." And with her man still gasping, Kyra
clicked on the light.</p>

<p>It was our friend's signal to go in; and he went in, his hand
on the weapon in his jacket pocket, very quickly, yet not, as it
seemed to me, watching the scene dirough the bathroom doorway,
quite quickly enough.</p>

<p>De Borneville, as I had imagined him, was still swaying where
he stood under the chandelier in the centre of the bedroom. His
complexion might have been white cheese. Sweat soaked his
forehead. The clipped hair on his upper lip twitched like a dog's
ear. But his brown eyes were unwinking as they looked on
Kyra&mdash;and it seemed to me&mdash;in fact, I was certain of
it&mdash;that he must have recognised her, in the second the
light went up, for the woman he had glanced at in the Press-box
on his way to the bar.</p>

<p>He did not gasp again when our friend came in and past him.
But the key, turning in the lock, sent a galvanic shiver through
his slight body, and I, who have been through shell-shock, knew
that he was suffering that peculiar torment which must have been
inflicted in other days by the rack.</p>

<p>Our friend, his pistol drawn now, was standing at the locked
door. I saw de Borneville's unwinking eyes turn over shoulder at
him. Then they switched back to Kyra, who spoke slowly,
emphasising every word.</p>

<p>"There is no need to confess," said Kyra. "Unless you feel
that a confession may save your mistress by proving that she
acted under your instigation. Everything <i>is</i> known. When
Castelvetri came to the door of your villa, unarmed, you sent
Jacques to open it. You had given Jacques his orders&mdash;to
come back with his father. You knew, when you gave those orders,
that the boy's father would not permit him to be present at your
discussion. And you calculated that his father would keep the boy
out of the veranda long enough for the three of you to do your
murder, though possibly not on the struggle that ended in
Castelvetri's flinging the boy from him, or the boy's head being
struck as he fell.</p>

<p>"Yes. You calculated on being able to kill him before Jacques
got back on to the veranda," repeated Kyra; and I realised, from
the pause she made, that she must be expecting an answer. But no
answer came from de Borneville, and presently she went on.</p>

<p>"When Castelvetri entered the veranda," went on Kyra, while de
Borneville's lips still twitched at her, "he did not see Oustric,
or his wife either. He only saw you. You were standing where it
had been planned that you should. You had calculated on telling
him to approach. As he approached, it was your plan that his
wife, who was behind him, should have fired one shot&mdash;wide
and high. Then Oustric, hidden behind you, could have fired the
second shot&mdash;to kill. After that, it would have been easy
enough to place Oustric's pistol by the dead man's side, to plant
the correct magazine in his pocket&mdash;and there would have
been two of you to swear that a woman, always easy to defend
before a French jury, had shot her husband in fear of her own
life.</p>

<p>"That was your plan." Again Kyra had paused. Again de
Borneville had made no answer. "But you had reckoned without your
victim's anger. His struggle with his son had enraged him. He
sprang straight at you, his fists clenched. He struck you. The
bruise on your nose proves it. And as he struck, your
mistress&mdash;fearful for your life&mdash;fired one shot.</p>

<p>"She fired," repeated Kyra, "and missed. But Oustric didn't
dare to fire. Castelvetri had been too quick for him. Castelvetri
had turned. He had caught his wife's wrist. As they struggled the
pistol went off, muzzle downwards, wounding her thigh.
Castelvetri tore the pistol away. When you saw him with it in his
hand, your nerve cracked. You bolted. Oustric's nerve had cracked
too. He fired in a panic, seven times. Castelvetri returned that
fire&mdash;once, with the tenth cartridge, as he was shot
down."</p>

<p>Kyra's voice stopped, on a silence such as follows machine-gun
fire at night over No Man's Land when a raider is alone. And
perhaps de Borneville relived such a moment, for as our friend
moved, and the hand of the law rested on his shoulder, his mouth
fell open and through thirty dreadful seconds it seemed to me
that he must confess.</p>

<p>"It will be better for her if you admit everything," said our
friend.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>But on that, abruptly, another shiver galvanised the slight
body; the feet steadied; the teeth snapped together; the lips
ceased their twitching, and I&mdash;who have been through
shell-shock&mdash;knew that, for the moment at any rate, de
Borneville was past his crisis, keyed up to that tension which
makes a man's body more dangerous than magazine-pistols to
handle, and his wits sharper than knives.</p>

<p>"<i>Du</i> bluff," he said to the Chief. "You know nothing.
Release me, Monsieur." And to Kyra: "A pretty trap. A pretty
theory."</p>

<p>Our friend, being a man, knew&mdash;as he told us
later&mdash;from the very stiffening of de Borneville's
shoulder-muscles that he and Kyra were already beaten. But Kyra,
being a woman, for all her cleverness, didn't. Also, or so it
seemed to me, she lost her temper a little. For, though our
friend's hand released de Borneville, her attack went on.</p>

<p>"Theory!" she shot at him. "It is the truth. You cannot deny
it."</p>

<p>"I do deny it. You cannot get over the evidence."</p>

<p>"Whose evidence?"</p>

<p>"Castelvetri's dying deposition."</p>

<p>"Begged of him by his wife, under cover of those reproaches
heard by the witness Piquart&mdash;after his muttering, 'Camille,
you have killed me,'&mdash;had made even the fool Oustric, who
planted the wrong magazine, realise that your story of <i>crime
passionnelle</i> must be altered&mdash;before you, Monsieur de
Borneville, had time to consult with your accomplices, to invent
a fresh story&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But de Bornville, still keyed, by his love for the woman
perhaps, to that pitch of emotional tension when a man, for good
or ill, can accomplish miracles, interrupted, grinning,
"<i>Your</i> story is certainly the more ingenious, mademoiselle.
It might even be the correct version. Yet the law is the law; and
I wager my neck that our twelve honest citizens will find mine
the more credible one."</p>

<h5>* * * * *</h5>

<p>And though Kyra still maintains, and our friend with her, that
hers is the only possible answer to the question: "Who killed
Castelvetri?" those twelve honest citizens did!</p>
