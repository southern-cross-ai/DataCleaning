<br>

<p class="first">I'VE FOUGHT all my life; sometimes for money,
sometimes for fun&mdash;once in a while for my life. But the
deadliest, most vicious fight I ever fought wasn't for none of them
things; no, sir, I was fighting wild and desperate <i>for the
privilege of getting a bullet through my brain!</i></p>

<p>Stand by and I'll tell you why I was fighting so me and my best
friend would get shot.</p>

<p>I'm the heavyweight champion of the <i>Sea Girl,</i> merchant
ship, my name being Steve Costigan. The Old Man is partial to warm
waters and island trade, see? Well, we was cruising through the
Solomons on our way to Brisbane, taking our time because the Old
Man practically growed up in the South Sea trade and knows all the
old traders and native chiefs and the like, and is always on the
lookout for bargains in pearls and such like.</p>

<p>Well, we hove to at a small island by the name of Roa-Toa which
had a small trading post on it. This post was run by the only white
man on the islands, a fellow named MacGregor, and him being an old
friend of the captain's, we run in for a visit.</p>

<p>The minute the Old Man had stepped onto the ramshackle wharf,
Bill O'Brien, my side kick, said to me, he said: "Steve, see that
motor launch down there by the wharf? Let's grab it and chase over
to Tamaru and see old Togo."</p>

<p>Tamaru was another little island so close to Roa-Toa you could
see the top of the old dead volcano. Togo was the chief; that
wasn't his name, but it was as near as we could come to pronouncing
it. He was a wrinkled old scoundrel and was a terrible sot, but
very friendly to the white men.</p>

<p>"The Old Man will likely stop at Tamaru," I said.</p>

<p>"He won't, either," said Bill. "Him and MacGregor will drink up
all the whiskey we got on board before he ever weighs anchor from
Roa-Toa. He won't stop by Tamaru because he won't have no liquor to
give to or trade with old Togo. Come on," said Bill. "We can easy
make it in that launch. If we hang around the mate will find
somethin' for us to do. Let's get to that launch and scoot before
the Old Man or MacGregor sees us. Mac wouldn't let us have it, like
as not, if we asked him."</p>

<p>So in a very short time we was heading out to sea, me and Bill,
and my white bulldog, Mike. I heard a kind of whooping above the
sputter of the motor, and looked back to see the Old Man and
MacGregor run out of the trading stores and they jumped up and down
and shook their fists and hollered, but we waggled our fingers at
them and kept on our course, full speed, dead ahead.</p>

<p>Well, in due time Tamaru grew up out of the ocean in front of
us, all still and dark green, with its dead volcano, and the trees
growing up the sides of the mountains.</p>

<p>Togo's village was right on the beach when we was there the year
before, but now much to our surprise we found nothing but a heap of
ruins. The huts was leveled, trees cut short close to the water's
edge, and not a sign of human life.</p>

<p>While we was talking, four or five natives come slithering out
of the jungle and approached us very friendly, with broad smiles.
Mike bristled and growled, but I put it down to the fact that no
white dog likes colored people. According to that, no black dog
ought to like white people, but it don't work.</p>

<p>Anyway, these kanakas made us understand in their pidgin English
that the village had been moved back in the jungle a way, and they
signified for us to come with them.</p>

<p>"Ask 'em how come they moved the village," I told Bill, who
could speak their language pretty well, and he said: "Aw, they say
the salt water made the babies sick. Don't worry about that; they
likely don't know theirselves why they moved. They don't often have
no reason for what they do. Let's go see Togo."</p>

<p>"Ask 'em how Togo is," I said, and Bill did, and said: "They
says he's as free from pain and sickness as a man can be."</p>

<p>The kanakas grinned and nodded. Well, we plodded after them, and
Mike he come along and growled deep down in his throat till I asked
him very irritably to please shut up. But he paid no attention.</p>

<p>After awhile we come on to a large open space and there was the
village. Just now they wasn't a sign of life, except a few native
dogs sleeping in the sun. A chill wiggled up and down my spine.</p>

<p>"Say," I said to Bill, "this is kind of queer; ask 'em where
Togo is."</p>

<p>"Where at is Togo?" said Bill, and one of the natives grinned
and pointed to a pole set in front of the biggest hut. At first I
couldn't make out what he meant. Then I did, and I suddenly got
sick at my stomach&mdash;and cold at the heart with fear. <i>On top
of that pole was a human head!</i> It was all that was left of poor
old Togo.</p>

<p>The next second two big kanakas had grabbed each of us from
behind, and a couple hundred more came swarming out of the
huts.</p>

<p>Bill, he give a yell and ducked, throwing one of his natives
clean over his head, and he twisted half way round and knocked the
other cold with a terrible biff on the jaw. Then the one on the
ground grabbed Bill by the legs, and another hit him over the head
with a club, laying his scalp open and knocking him to his
knees.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I was having my troubles. The minute them two grabbed
me, Mike went for them, jerked one of them off me, got him down and
nearly tore him apart. At the same instant I jammed my elbow
backward, and by sheer luck connected with the other one's solar
plexus. He grunted and loosened his hold, and I wheeled round to
smash him, but as I did, I felt a sharp prick between my shoulders
and knowed one of them was holding a spear at my back. I stopped
short and stood still. The next minute me and Bill was tied hand
and foot. I looked at Bill; he was bleeding plenty from the cut in
his head, but he grinned.</p>

<p>Well, all that took something less than a minute. Three or four
natives had went for Mike and pulled him off of his victim, which
was howling and bleeding like a stuck hog. The said victim
staggered away to the nearest hut, looking like a wreck on a lee
shore, and the others danced and jumped around Mike trying to stab
him with spears and hit him with clubs, without losing a leg at the
same time; while Mike tried to eat his way through them to me.</p>

<p>Then while I watched with my heart in my mouth, <i>crack!</i>
went a pistol and Mike went down, rolling over and over till he lay
still with the blood oozing from his head. I give a terrible cry
and began to rave and tear at my ropes; I struggled so wild and
desperate that I jerked loose from the kanakas which was holding
me, and fell on the ground, being tied up like I was.</p>

<p>Then they pulled me and Bill roughly around to face a big dark
fellow who came swaggering up, a smoking pistol in his hand. At
first glance it struck me I'd seen him before, but all I wanted to
do now was get loose and tear his throat out with my bare hands for
killing Mike.</p>

<p>This bezark stopped in front of us, twirling his gun on his
forefinger and I looked close at him. If looks and wishes would
kill, he would of dropped dead three times in succession. A big,
tall, beautifully built native he was, but he didn't look like the
rest. He had a kind of yellow tint to his skin, whereas they was
golden brown. And his face wasn't open and good natured like theirs
was in repose; it was cruel and slant-eyed and thin-lipped. Malay
blood there, I quickly seen. A half breed, with the worst blood of
both races. He was dressed in just a loin cloth, like the rest, but
somewhere, I knowed, I'd seen him in different clothes and
different surroundings. Well, if I hadn't been so grieved and mad
on account of Mike, I guess I'd have knowed him right off.</p>

<p>"Well, Meestah Costigan," said the big ham, in a kind of throaty
voice, "you visit my island, eh? You like my welcome, maybeso?
Maybeso you stay a long time, eh? Glad you come, me; I rather see
you than any other man in the world!"</p>

<p>He was still grinning, but when he said the last his heavy jaws
come together like the snap of a alligator. And then Bill, who was
glaring at him like he couldn't believe his eyes, yelled:
"Santos!"</p>

<p>It all come back to me in a flash! And I would of fell over from
sheer surprise, hadst I not been tied and held up. Sure, I
remembered! And you ought to, too, if you keep up with even part of
the fighters that comes and goes.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago I'd met Santos in a Frisco ring. Yeah!
Battling Santos, the Borneo Tiger, that Abie Hussenstein had
discovered slaughtering second-raters in Asiatic ports. Abie
brought him to America after Santos had cleaned up everything in
sight over there.</p>

<p>They is no doubt that the big boy was good. In America he went
through his first rank of set-ups like a sickle through wheat. He
was fast, fairly clever for a big man, and strong as a bull.</p>

<p>Well, his first first-rater was Tom York, you remember, and Tom
outboxed him easy in the first round, but in the second Santos
landed a crusher that broke Tom's nose and knocked out four teeth.
From then on it was a butchery, and the referee stopped it in the
fifth to keep York from being killed. After that the scribes raved
over Santos more than ever, called him a second Firpo and said he
couldn't miss being champion.</p>

<p>Abie was sparring for matches in the Garden and he sent Santos
back to Frisco to pad his k.o. record and keep in trim by toppling
some ham-and-eggers. Then, enter a dark man, the villain of the
play&mdash;otherwise Steve Costigan.</p>

<p>Santos was matched to meet Joe Handler ten rounds in San
Francisco. The very day of the fight, Handler sprained his ankle,
and they substituted me the last minute. I needn't tell you I went
into the ring on the short end of about a hundred to one, with no
takers&mdash;except the <i>Sea Girl</i>'s crew, who seem to think I
can lick anybody, simply because I've licked all of them.</p>

<p>Well, I reckon the praise and hurrah and all had went to Santos'
head. He come out clowning and playing up to the crowd. He feinted
at me with his big long brown arms and made faces and wise-cracks,
as I come out of my corner. He dropped his gloves, stuck out his
jaw and motioned me to hit him. This got a big laugh out of the
crowd, and while he was doing that, with his mouth wide open,
laughing, I hit him!</p>

<p>I reckon I was closer to him than he thought, for it was a wide
open shot. I crashed my right from my knee, and I plunged in behind
it with everything I had. I smashed solid on his sagging jaw so
hard it numbed my whole arm. I don't see how I come not to tear his
jaw clean off. Anyway, he hit the canvas like he figured on staying
there indefinite, and they had to carry him to his dressing room to
bring him to.</p>

<p>When everybody got their breath back, they yelled "fluke!
fluke!" And it was, because Santos would of licked me, if he'd
watched hisself. But it finished him; he'd lost his heart, or
something.</p>

<p>His next start he dropped a decision to Kid Allison, and he lost
two more fights in a row that way. Hussenstein give him the bounce
and he dropped out of view. Santos had gone back to stoking, people
supposed; the public had forgot all about him, and I had too,
nearly. But here he was!</p>

<p>All this flashed through my brain as I stood and gawped at the
big cheese. Say, if Santos had looked tigerish in the ring, in
civilized settings, he looked deadly now.</p>

<p>He stuck the pistol back into his girdle and said, easy and
lazy: "Well, Meestah Costigan, you remember me, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I do, you dirty half-breed!" I roared. "What you mean
shootin' my dog? Lem'me loose, and I'll rip your heart out!"</p>

<p>He bared his white teeth in a kind of venomous smile and
gestured lazily toward the pole where old Togo's head was.</p>

<p>"You come to see your old friend, eh? Well, there he is! What
left of him. Now Santos is chief! The old man was fool; the young
men, they follow Santos. Now we make palaver; you my guests!"</p>

<p>And with that he laughed in a cold deadly way and said something
to the kanakas which was holding us. He turned his back and walked
toward his hut, them dragging us along anyway. I looked back,
though, and my heart give a jump. Old Mike got to his feet kind of
groggy and glassy-eyed, and shook his head and looked around for
me. He seen me and started toward me; then he seen Santos, and
sneaked away among the trees. I give a sigh of relief. Must be the
bullet just grazed him enough to knock him out; nobody had seen him
get up and hide but me, and he was safe for the time being, at
least&mdash;which was something me and Bill O'Brien
wasn't&mdash;and I guess Bill felt the same way for he looked kind
of white.</p>

<p>Santos sat down in a chair, which was one the Old Man had give
poor old Togo, and we was propped up in front of him.</p>

<p>"Once we meet before, Costigan," he said, "in your country. Now
we meet in mine. This my country. I born here. Big fool, me. I
leave with white men on ship when very young. I scrub decks; then
shovel coal. I fight with other stokers. I meet Hus'stein and fight
for him. He take me to Australia&mdash;America; I lick everybody.
Everybody yell when I come in ring."</p>

<p>The grin had faded off his map and a wild light was growing in
his eyes; they was getting red.</p>

<p>"Then I meet you!" his voice had dropped to a kind of hiss.
"They tell me you one big ham. Nothing in the head! I think make
people laugh! I hold out my face, say: 'Hit me!' Then I think
maybeso the roof fall on me."</p>

<p>He was snarling like a wild beast now; his chest was heaving
with rage and his big hands was working like my throat was between
them.</p>

<p>"After that, I not so good. People say dirty things now at me.
They say: 'Yellow! Glass chin! Throw him out!' Hus'stein say: 'Get
out! You no drawing card now!' I go to stoking again. I work my way
back to my people; my island."</p>

<p>He give a short grim laugh. He hit his breast with his fist.</p>

<p>"Me king, now! Togo old fool; friend to white man! Bah! I say to
young men: make me king! We kill white men, and take rum and cloth
and guns like our people did long ago. So I kill Togo, and old men
that follow him! And you&mdash;" His eyes burned into me.</p>

<p>"You make fool of me," he said slowly. "Aaahhh! I pay you back!"
He looked like a madman, gnashing his teeth and rolling his eyes as
he roared at us.</p>

<p>I looked at Bill, uncertain like, and Bill says, nervy enough,
but in a kind of unsteady voice: "You don't dast harm a white man.
You may be king of this one-horse hunk of mud, but you know blame
well if you knock us off, you'll have a British gunboat on your
neck."</p>

<p>Santos grinned like a ogre and sank back in his chair. If he'd
ever been half way civilized, which I doubt, he had sure reverted
back to type again.</p>

<p>"The British have come," said he. "They knocked our village to
pieces and killed a few pigs. But we ran away into the jungle and
they could no find us. They shoot some shells around and then steam
away, the white swine! That was because we fire on a trading boat
and kill a sailor."</p>

<p>"Well," said Bill, "the <i>Sea Girl</i>'s anchored off Roa-Toa
and if you harm us, the crew won't leave nobody alive on this
island. They won't shoot at you from long range. They'll land and
mop up."</p>

<p>"Soon I go to Roa-Toa," said Santos, very placid. "I think I
like to be king of Roa-Toa too; I kill MacGregor, and take his guns
and all. If your ship come here, I take her, too. You think I no
dare kill white man? Eh? Big fool, you."</p>

<p>"Well," I roared, the suspense being too much for me, "what you
goin' to do with us, you yellow-bellied half-breed!"</p>

<p>"I kill you both!" he hissed, smiling and playing with his
gun.</p>

<p>"Then do it, and get it over with," I snarled, being afraid I'd
blow up if he dragged it out too long. "But, lem'me tell you
somethin'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he smiled, "not with the pistol. That is too easy, eh?
I want you to suffer like I suffered."</p>

<p>"I don't get yuh," I growled. "It's all in the game. I don't see
why you got it in for me. If you'd a-licked me, I wouldn't of
kicked. Anyway, you got no cause to bump off Bill, too."</p>

<p>"I kill you all!" he shouted, leaping up again. "And you
two&mdash;you will howl for death before I get through.
<i>Arrgh!</i> You will scream to die&mdash;but you will no die till
I am ready."</p>

<p>He came close to me and his wild beast eyes burned into
mine.</p>

<p>"Slow you will die," he whispered. "Slow&mdash;slow! For that
blow you strike me, you suffer&mdash;and for all I suffer at the
hands of your people, you shall suffer ten times ten!"</p>

<p>He stopped and glared at me.</p>

<p>"The Death of a Thousand Cuts shall be yours," he purred. "You
know that, eh? Ah, you been to China! I know you know it, because
your face go white now!" I reckon mine did, all right. I knew what
he meant, and so did Bill. "Me, I show them where to cut," went on
Santos, "for I have seen the Chinese torture like those."</p>

<p>I felt froze solid and my clothes were damp with sweat; also I
was mad, like a caged rat.</p>

<p>"All right, you black swine!" I yelled at him, kind of off my
bat, I reckon. "Go ahead&mdash;do your worst! But remember one
thing&mdash;remember that I licked you! I knocked you cold! Killin'
me won't alter the fact that I'm the best man!"</p>

<p>He screamed like a maddened jungle cat and I thought he'd go
clean nuts. I'd sure touched him to the quick there!</p>

<p>"You did no beat me!" he howled. "I was big fool! I let you hit
me! White pig, I break you with my hands! I tear your heart out and
give it to the dogs!"</p>

<p>"Well, why didn't you?" I asked bitterly. "You had your chance,
and you sure muffed it! I licked you then, and I can lick you now.
You wouldn't dare look at me crost-wise if my hands wasn't tied.
I'll die knowin' that I licked you."</p>

<p>His eyes was red as a blood-mad tiger's now, and they glittered
at me from under his thick black brows. He grinned, but they was no
mirth in it.</p>

<p>"I fight you again," he whispered. "We fight before I kill you.
I give you something to fight for, too: if I whip you, and no kill
you&mdash;you die under the knives; and your friend, too. If I whip
you, and kill you with my hands&mdash;your friend die under the
cuts. But if you whip me, then I no torture you, but kill you both
quick." He tapped his pistol.</p>

<p>Anything sounded better than the thousand cuts business, and,
anyway, I'd have a chance to go out fighting.</p>

<p>"And suppose I kill you?" I asked.</p>

<p>He laughed contemptuously. "No chance. But if you do, my people
shoot you quick."</p>

<p>"Take him up, Steve," said Bill. "It's the best of a bad
bargain, any way you look at it."</p>

<p>"I'll fight you on your own terms," I said to Santos.</p>

<p>He grunted, yelled some orders in his own tongue, and the stage
was set for the strangest battle I ever had.</p>

<p>In the open space between the huts, the natives made a big ring,
standing shoulder to shoulder, about three deep, the men behind
looking over the shoulders of those in front. The kids and women
come out of the huts and tried to watch the fight between the men's
legs.</p>

<p>A sort of oval-shaped space was left clear. At each end of this
space stood a thick post, set deep in the ground. They tied Bill to
one of these posts.</p>

<p>"I can't be in your corner this fight, old sea horse," said
Bill, kind of drawn-faced, but still grinning.</p>

<p>"Well, in a way you are," I said. "You can't sponge my cuts and
wave a towel, but you can yell advice when the goin's rough.
Anyway," I said, "you got a good view of the fight."</p>

<p>"Sure," he grinned, "I got a ringside seat."</p>

<p>About that time the kanakas unfastened my ropes, and I worked my
hands and fingers to get the circulation started again. Bill's
hands was tied, so we couldn't shake hands, but I clapped him on
the shoulder, and we looked at each other a second. Seafaring men
ain't much on showing their emotions, and they ain't very
demonstrative, but each of us knew how the other felt. We'd kicked
around a good many years together&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, I turned around and walked to the middle of the oval, and
waited. I didn't have to wait long. Santos came from the other end,
his head lowered, his red eyes blazing, a terrible smile on his
lips. All he wore was a loin cloth; all I had on was an old pair of
pants. We was both bare-footed; and, of course, bare-handed.</p>

<p>I'd never seen anything like this in my life before. They was no
bright lights except the merciless tropic sun; they was no cheering
crowds&mdash;nothing but a band of savages that wanted our blood;
they was no seconds, no referee&mdash;only a hard-faced kanaka with
gaudy feathers in his hair, holding Santos' pistol. They was no
purse but death. A quick death if I won; a long, slow, terrible
death if I lost.</p>

<p>Santos was rangy, big, tapering from wide shoulders to lean
legs. Speed and power there was in them smooth, heavy muscles. He
was six feet one and a half inch tall; heavier than when I first
fought him, but the extra weight was hard muscle. I don't believe
he had a ounce of fat on him. He must have weighed two hundred,
which gave him about ten pounds on me.</p>

<p>For a second we moved in a half circle, wary and deadly, and
then he roared and come lashing in like a tidal wave. He shot left
and right to my head so fast that for a second I was too busy
ducking and blocking to think. He was crazy to knock my head off;
he was shipping everything he had in that direction. Well, it's
hard to knock a tough man cold with bare-knuckled head punches. The
raw 'uns cut and bruise, but they ain't got the numbing shock the
padded glove has. You'll notice most of the knock-outs in the old
bare-knuckle days was from blows to the body and throat.</p>

<p>The moment I had a breathing space, I hooked a wicked left to
the belly. His ridged muscles felt like flexible steel bands under
my knuckles, and he merely snarled and lashed back with a
right-hander which bruised my forearm when I blocked it. He was
fast and his left was chain lightning&mdash;he shot it straight, he
uppercut, and he hooked, just like that&mdash;<i>zip! blip!
blam!</i></p>

<p>The hook flattened my right ear, and almost simultaneously he
threw his right with everything he had. I ducked and he missed by a
hair's lash. Jerusha! I heard that right sing past my head like a
slung shot, and Santos spun off balance and went to his knees from
the force of it. He was up like a cat, spitting and snarling, and I
heard Bill yell: "For the love of Mike, Steve, watch that right, or
he'll knock your head clean off!"</p>

<p>Well, I guess in a ring with ordinary stakes, Santos would have
finished me; but this was different. I'm tough any time; now I was
fighting for the privilege of me and my pard going out clean. The
thought of them sharp little knives put steel in me.</p>

<p>Santos grinned like a devil as he came in again. This time he
didn't rush, he edged craftily, left hand out, watching for a
chance to shoot his deadly right over. That's once I wished I was
clever! But I ain't, and I knew if I tried to box him, I wouldn't
have a chance. So I come in sudden and wide open; his right swished
through the air and looped around my neck as I ducked and I braced
my feet and ripped both hands to his
midriff&mdash;<i>bam</i>&mdash;<i>bam!</i> The next second his left
chopped down on the back of my head. I went into a clinch, and his
teeth snapped like a wolf's at my throat as I tied him up. He was
snarling at me in his language as we worked out of the clinch, and
he nailed me on the breakaway with a straight left to the mouth,
which instantly began to bleed.</p>

<p>The sight of the blood maddened the kanakas, and they began to
yell like jungle beasts. Santos laughed wild and fierce, and began
swinging at my head again with both hands. To date he hadn't tried
a single body blow. Three times he landed to the side of my head
with a swinging left, and I dug my right into his midriff. His
right came over, and I blocked it with my elbow, then shot my own
right to his belly again. He'd give a kind of sway with his whole
body as he let go the right to give it extra force, and his arm
would snap through the air like a big steel spring released.</p>

<p><i>Crash!</i> His left landed on the side of my head, and I seen
ten thousand stars. <i>Bam!</i> His right followed, and I blocked
it. But this time it landed flush on the upper arm instead of the
elbow, and for a second I thought the bone was broke. The whole arm
was numb, and, desperate, I crashed into close quarters and ripped
short-arm rights to his belly, while he slashed at my head with
short hooks. He wasn't so good in close; he didn't like it, and he
broke away and backed off, spearing me with his long left as I
followed.</p>

<p>But my blood was up now and I kept right on top of him. I
slashed a left hook to his face, sank a straight right under his
heart&mdash;<i>wham!</i> He brought up a left uppercut that nearly
ripped my head off. He flailed in with a torrid right, and I
hunched my left shoulder just in time to save my jaw. At the same
time I shot my right for his jaw and landed solid, but a little
high. He swayed like a tall tree, his eyes rolled, but he come back
with a screech like a tree cat and flashed a vicious left to my
already bleeding mouth. The right came in behind it like a
thunderbolt and I done the only thing I could&mdash;ducked, and
took it high on the front part of my head. Jerusha! It felt like my
skull was unjointed! I heard Bill scream as I hit the ground so
hard it nearly knocked the breath clean outa me.</p>

<p>It was just like being hit with a hammer. A stream of blood
trickled down into my eyes from where the scalp had been laid
open.</p>

<p>I dunno why Santos stepped back and let me get up. Force of
habit, I guess. Anyway, as I scrambled up, shaking the blood outa
my eyes, he give me a ferocious grin and said: "Now I kill you,
white man!" And come slithering in to do it. He feinted his left,
drew it back, and as he feinted again, I threw my right, wild and
overhand, desperate like, and caught him under the cheek bone.
Blood spurted and he went back on his heels. I ripped a left to his
belly and he grabbed me and held on like a big python, clubbing me
with his left till I tore loose.</p>

<p>He nailed me with the right as I went away from him, but it
lacked the old jar. I got a hard skull. No man could of landed like
he did without hurting his hand some, anyway. But his left was so
fast it looked and felt like twins. He shot it at one of my eyes in
straight jabs till I felt that eye closing, and then, as I stepped
in with a slashing right to the ribs, he came back with a terrible
left hook that split my other eyebrow wide open and the lid sagged
down like a curtain halfway over the eye.</p>

<p>"Work in close, Steve!" I heard Bill yell, above the howling of
the kanakas. "If he keeps you at long range, he'll kill you!"</p>

<p>I'd already decided that! I wrapped both arms around my head and
plunged in till my forehead bumped his chin, and then I started
ripping both hands to the belly and heart. His left was beating my
right cauliflower to a pulp, but I kept blasting away with both
hands till the whole world was blind and red; but he was softening.
My fists were sinking deeper into his belly at every blow, and I
heard him gasp. Then he wrapped his long, snaky arms around me and
pinned me tight. As we tussled back and forth, with his breath hot
in my ear, he sunk his teeth into my shoulder and worried it like a
dog shaking a rat, growling deep in his throat till I tore away by
main strength, and brought a stream of blood from his lips with a
smashing right hook.</p>

<p>Then Santos went clean crazy. He howled like a wolf and began
throwing punches wild and terrible, without aim or timing. He
wasn't thinking about that sore right no more. It was like the air
was full of flying sledge-hammers. Some he missed from sheer
wildness; I blocked till my arms and shoulders ached. Plenty
landed. I slashed a left to his face&mdash;and
<i>crack!</i>&mdash;his right bashed into mine, smashing my nose
flat. I heard the bones crackle and snap and a red mist waved in
front of my eyes so I couldn't see. I felt faintly the impact of
another blow, and then I felt the ground under my shoulders.</p>

<p>I lay there, counting to myself; my head was clearing fast.
Nobody ever accused me of not being tough! Having my nose broke was
a old story. I said to myself: "Nine!" and got to my feet, wrapping
both arms around my head and crouching. Santos yelled and battered
at my arms while I glared at him over them, and suddenly I unwound
and sank my right to the wrist in his belly. Yes, he was getting
soft from my continued batterings! His body muscles was getting too
sore to contract hard and my fists sank in deep. Santos bent
double, but came up with a punishing left uppercut to the jaw that
dazed me and before I could recover, he ripped over that
sledge-hammer right. It tore my left ear loose from my head and I
felt it flap against my cheek.</p>

<p>I was out on my feet; just fighting from the old battle
instinct, now. Some kind of a smash sent me back on my heels, and I
felt myself falling backward and couldn't stop. Then I fell against
something and heard a fierce voice in my ear: "Steve! He's
weakening! Just one more smash, old sea horse, and he's yours!"</p>

<p>We had fought back to the end of the oval space and I was
leaning against the post where Bill was tied. I made a desperate
effort to right myself. Santos was watching me with his hands down
and a nasty sneer on his face. He put his hands out and gripped my
shoulders. He was marked pretty well hisself.</p>

<p>"You licked now," he said. "The little knives, now they feast!
The Death of a Thousand Cuts, it is yours!"</p>

<p>At that I went kind of crazy, too. I lunged away from the post,
and missed with a wild right, and the slaughter recommenced. Santos
was mad and bewildered. Well, he wasn't the first fighter who
couldn't understand why I kept getting up. My eyes was full of
blood and sweat; one was nearly closed, and the sagging lid nearly
hid the other. My nose was busted flat, one ear was hanging loose
and the other swole out of all proportions. My left shoulder and
arm was so numbed from blocking Santos' terrible right, I couldn't
lift it but a few inches above my waist line. My wind was giving
out; I didn't know how long the fight had been going on; it seemed
to me like we'd been fighting for centuries. I dunno what kept me
on my feet; I dunno what kept me going. I'd almost got to where I
didn't know nor care what they did to me. Sometimes I'd forget what
we was fighting for. Sometimes I'd think it was because Santos had
killed Mike, then again it would be Bill I'd think he'd killed.
Once I thought we was back in the ring in Frisco.</p>

<p>Then I was down on my back, and Santos was kneeling on my chest,
strangling me. I tore his hold loose and threw him off, and then we
was standing toe to toe, trading slow, hard smashes. Then suddenly
Santos shifted his attack for the first time and catapulted a
blasting right to my body. Something snapped like a dead stick and
I went to my knees with a red-hot knife cutting into my left
side.</p>

<p>Santos standing over me, kicked at me with his big bare feet
till I caught his legs, and as I clung on and he rained blows down
at my head, I heard Bill's voice above the uproar: <i>"You got his
goat, Steve! Get up! Get up once and he's licked!"</i></p>

<p>I got up. I climbed that Malay devil's legs, paying no attention
to the punches he showered on me, and as I leaned on his chest and
our eyes glared into each other's, I saw a wild, terrible light had
come into his&mdash;the light that's in a trapped
tiger's&mdash;scared and bewildered, and dangerous as death. I'd
fought him to a standstill&mdash;I had his number! And at them
thoughts, strength flowed back into my arms. He flailed at me, but
the kick was going from his blows; he was nearly punched out.</p>

<p>I stepped back and then drove in again. He was snarling between
his teeth, and then he took a deep breath. The instant I saw his
midriff go in, I sank my left in to the wrist, and as he bent
forward I slugged him behind the ear, and he dropped to his knees.
But he come up, gasping and wild. He'd forgot all the boxing he
ever knowed, now. I stepped inside his wild swings and crashed my
right under his heart, and though it was the most fearful agony to
do it, brought up my left to his jaw. He went down on his haunches
and I heard, in the deathly silence which had fell, Bill yelling
for me to give him the boots. But I don't fight that way&mdash;even
if I'd of had any boots on.</p>

<p>But Santos wasn't through. He was all savage now, and too
primitive to be stopped by ordinary means. I'd fought him to a
standstill; he was licked at this game. And he went clean back to
the Stone Age. He leaped off the ground, howling and slavering at
the mouth, and sprang at me with his fingers spread like talons;
not to hit, but to strangle, tear, claw and gnash. And as he came
in wide open, I met him with the same kind of punch I'd flattened
him with once; a blasting right I brought up from my knee.
<i>Crack!</i> I felt his jaw-bone and my hand give way as I landed,
and he turned a complete somersault, heels over head, and crashed
down on his back a dozen feet away. You'd think that would hold a
man, wouldn't you? Well, it would&mdash;a man.</p>

<p>It's possible to break a man's jaw with your bare fist, and
still not knock him unconscious. Any ordinary man wouldn't be able
to do nothing more after that. But Santos wasn't a man, no more; he
was a jungle varmint, and he'd gone mad.</p>

<p>Before I could tell what he was going to do, he whirled and tore
a long-handled battle-axe from the hand of a warrior in the front
rank. He must have been on the point of collapse; he'd taken
fearful punishment. Where he found strength for his last effort, I
dunno. But it all happened in a flash. He had the axe and was
looming over me like a black cloud of death before I could move. As
he bounded in and swung up the thing above his head, I threw up my
right arm. That saved my life; and the axe head missed the arm, but
the heavy handle broke my forearm like a match, and knocked me flat
on my shoulders.</p>

<p>Santos howled, swung up the axe and leaped again&mdash;and a
white thunderbolt shot across me and met him in mid-air! Square on
the Malay's chest Mike landed, and the impact knocked Santos flat
on his back. One terrible scream he gave, and then Mike's iron jaws
closed on his throat.</p>

<p>In a second it was the craziest confusion you ever seen. Kanakas
whooping and yelling and running and falling over each other doing
nothing, and Bill swearing something terrible and tearing at his
bonds&mdash;and Mike making a bloody mess out of Santos in the
middle of all of it. I tried to get up, but I was done. I got to my
knees and slumped over again.</p>

<p>The rest is all like a dream. I saw the kanaka with the pistol
shoot at Mike, and miss&mdash;and then, like an echo, come another
shot&mdash;and the kanaka whooped, clapped his hand to the seat of
his loin cloth, and scooted. I heard yelling in white men's voices,
shots and a hurrah generally and then into my line of
vision&mdash;considerably blurred&mdash;hove the Old Man,
MacGregor, and Penrhyn, the mate, all cursing and whooping, with
the whole crew behind them.</p>

<p>"Great Jupiter!" squawked the Old Man, red faced and puffing, as
he leaned over me.</p>

<p>"They've kilt Steve! They've beat him to death with axes!"</p>

<p>"He ain't dead!" snarled Bill, twisting at his ropes. "He has
just fit the toughest fight I ever seen&mdash;will some of you salt
pork and biscuit eaters untie me from this post?"</p>

<p>"Rig a stretcher," said the Old Man. "If Steve ain't dead, he's
the next thing to it. Hey, what the&mdash;!"</p>

<p>At this moment Mike came sauntering over and sat down beside me,
licking my hand.</p>

<p>"Wh-who&mdash;who is&mdash;<i>was&mdash;</i> that?" asked the
Old Man, kind of white-faced, pointing to what Mike had left.</p>

<p>"That there is what's left of Battlin' Santos, the Borneo
Tiger," said Bill, stretching his arms with relish. "History
repeats itself, and Steve has just handed him a most artistic
trimmin'&mdash;are you goopin' swabs goin' to let Steve die here?
Get him on board ship, will you?"</p>

<p>"Look about Mike first," I mumbled. "Santos shot him with a
pistol."</p>

<p>"Just a graze," pronounced MacGregor, examining Mike's unusually
hard head. "Shot him with a pistol, eh? Guess if he'd used a rifle
the dawg would of slaughtered the whole tribe. Wait, don't put
Costigan on the stretcher till I mop off some of his blood."</p>

<p>I felt his hands feeling around over me, and I cussed when he'd
gouge me.</p>

<p>"He'll be all right," he pronounced, "soon's we've set his arm
and this rib here, and stitched his ear back on, and took up a few
more gashes. And that nose'll need some attention, though I ain't
set many noses."</p>

<p>I kind of dimly remember being carried back to the ship, with
Mike trotting alongside, and I heard Bill and the Old Man yappin'
at each other back and forth.</p>

<p>"&mdash;and no sooner had Mac here got through tellin' me that
Santos had killed old Togo and set hisself up as king, than we
heard the motor launch sputter, and see you two prize jackasses
scootin' away into the jaws uh death. We yelled and whooped but you
was too smart to listen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How in the name of seven dizzy mermaids did you expect us to
hear you with the motor goin'?"</p>

<p>"&mdash;and I says, 'Mac,' I says, 'it ain't worth it to save
their useless hides, but we got to do it.' And it bein' a
well-known fact that a fast motor launch can make more speed than a
sailin' vessel, includin' even the <i>Sea Girl,</i> which is all we
had to rescue you in, we have just now arrove at the village. Hadst
it not been for me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hadst it not been for Steve, you would of found only a few
hunks of raw beef. Santos was goin' to carve us, and believe you me
when I tell yuh Steve fought him to a standstill! Steve was licked
to a frazzle, and didn't know it! Santos had everything, and he
made Steve into the hash which now lies on that stretcher, but the
old sea horse just naturally outgamed him. Accordin' to rights,
Steve shoulda been knocked cold five times."</p>

<p><i>"Arrumph, arrumph!"</i> growled the Old Man, but I could tell
he was that proud he couldn't hardly keep his feet on the ground.
"I'd of give the price of a cargo to see that fight. Well, we
didn't do like the British gunboat did&mdash;anchor off-shore and
shell a few huts. We went through that jungle like Neptune goes
through the water, and all of the bucks was too interested to know
we was comin' till we swarmed out on 'em.</p>

<p>"I'm tellin' you, we'd of scuppered a flock of them, if my crew
wasn't the worst aggregation of poor shots on the Seven
Seas&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, hey," said the crew, "we didn't notice you bringin' down
nobody on the fly."</p>

<p>"Shut up!" roared the Old Man. "I'm boss here and I'll be
respected."</p>

<p>"For cats' sake," I snarled through my pulped lips, "will you
cock-eyed sea horses dry up and let a sufferin' man suffer in his
own way?"</p>

<p>"Don't think you rate so high, just because you're a little
bunged up," growled Bill; but they was a catch in his voice. From
the way he gripped my hand, I knowed exactly how he felt.</p>
