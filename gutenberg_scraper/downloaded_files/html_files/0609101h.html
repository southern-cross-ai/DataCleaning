<h1>General Ironfist</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Robert E. Howard</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<p>AS I CLUMB into the ring that night in the Pleasure Palace Fight
Club, on the Hong Kong waterfront, I was low in my mind. I'd come
to Hong Kong looking for a former shipmate of mine. I'd come on
from Tainan as fast as I could, even leaving my bulldog Mike aboard
the <i>Sea Girl,</i> which wasn't due to touch at Hong Kong for a
couple of weeks yet.</p>

<p>But Soapy Jackson, the feller I was looking for, had just
dropped plumb out of sight. Nobody'd saw him for weeks, or knowed
what had become of him. Meanwhile my dough was all gone, so I
accepted a bout with a big Chinese fighter they called the Yeller
Typhoon.</p>

<p>He was a favorite with the sporting crowd and the Palace was
jammed with both white men and Chineses that night, some very high
class. I noticed one Chinee in particular, whilst setting in my
corner waiting for the bell, because his European clothes was so
swell, and because he seemed to take such a burning interest in the
goings on. But I didn't pay much attention to the crowd; I was
impatient to get the battle over with.</p>

<p>The Yeller Typhoon weighed three hundred pounds and he was a
head taller'n me; but most of his weight was around his waist-line,
and he didn't have the kind of arms and shoulders that makes a
hitter. And it don't make no difference how big a Chinaman is, he
can't take it.</p>

<p>I wasn't in no mood for classy boxing that night. I just walked
into him, let him flail away with both hands till I seen a opening,
and then let go my right. He shook the ring when he hit the boards,
and the brawl was over.</p>

<p>Paying no heed to the howls of the dumbfounded multitude, I
hastened to my dressing-room, donned my duds, and then hauled a
letter from my britches pocket and studied it like I'd done a
hundred times before.</p>

<p>It was addressed to Mr. Soapy Jackson, American Bar, Tainan,
Taiwan, and was from a San Francisco law firm. After Soapy left the
<i>Sea Girl,</i> he tended bar at the American, but he'd been gone
a month when the <i>Sea Girl</i> docked at Tainan again, and the
proprietor showed me that letter which had just come for him. He
said Soapy had went to Hong Kong, but he didn't know his address,
so I took the letter and come on alone to find him, because I had a
idea it was important. Maybe he'd been left a fortune.</p>

<p>But I'd found Hong Kong in turmoil, just like all the rest of
China. Up in the hills a lot of bandits, which called themselves
revolutionary armies, was raising hell, and all I couldst hear was
talk about General Yun Chei, and General Whang Shan, and General
Feng, which they said was really a white man. Folks said Yun and
Feng had joined up against Whang, and some tall battling was
expected, and the foreigners was all piling down out of the
interior. It was easy for a white sailorman with no connections to
drop out of sight and never be heard of again. I thought what if
Soapy has got hisself scuppered by them bloody devils, just when
maybe he was on the p'int of coming into big money.</p>

<p>Well, I stuck the letter in my pocket, and sallied forth into
the lamp-lit street to look for Soapy some more, when somebody hove
up alongside of me, and who should it be but that dapper Chinee in
European clothes I'd noticed in the first row, ringside, at the
fight.</p>

<p>"You are Sailor Costigan, are you not?" he said in perfect
English.</p>

<p>"Yeah," I said, after due consideration.</p>

<p>"I saw you fight the Yellow Typhoon tonight," he said. "The blow
you dealt him would have felled an ox. Can you always hit like
that?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" I inquired. He looked me over closely, and nodded his
head like he was agreeing with hisself about something.</p>

<p>"Come in and have a drink," he said, so I follered him into a
native joint where they wasn't nothing but Chineses. They looked at
me with about as much expression as fishes, and went on guzzling
tea and rice wine out of them little fool egg-shell cups. The
mandarin, or whatever he was, led the way into a room which the
door was covered with velvet curtains and the walls had silk
hangings with dragons all over 'em, and we sot down at a ebony
table and a Chinaboy brung in a porcelain jug and the glasses.</p>

<p>The mandarin poured out the licker, and, whilst he was pouring
mine, such a infernal racket arose outside the door that I turned
around and looked, but couldn't see nothing for the curtains, and
the noise quieted down all of a sudden. Them Chineses is always
squabbling amongst theirselves.</p>

<p>So the mandarin said, "Let us drink to your vivid victory!"</p>

<p>"Aw," I said, "that wasn't nothin'. All I had to do was hit
him."</p>

<p>But I drank, and I said, "This is funny tastin' stuff. What is
it?"</p>

<p><i>"Kaoliang,"</i> he said. "Have another glass." So he poured
'em, and nigh upsot my glass with his sleeve as he handed it to
me.</p>

<p>So I drank it, and he said, "What's the matter with your
ears?"</p>

<p>"You oughta know, bein' a fight fan," I said.</p>

<p>"This fight tonight was the first I have ever witnessed," he
confessed.</p>

<p>"I'd never thought it from the interest you've taken in the
brawl," I said. "Well, these ears is what is known in the
vernacular of the game as cauliflowers. I got 'em, also this
undulatin' nose, from stoppin' gloves with human knuckles inside of
'em. All old-timers is similarly decorated, unless they happen to
be of the dancin'-school variety."</p>

<p>"You have fought in the ring many times?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Oftener'n I can remember," I answered, and his black eyes
gleamed with some secret pleasure. I took another snort of that
there Chinese licker out of the jug, and I begun to feel oratorical
and histrionic.</p>

<p>"From Savannah to Singapore," I said, "from the alleys of
Bristol to the wharfs of Melbourne, I've soaked the resin dust with
my blood and the gore of my enemies. I'm the bully of the <i>Sea
Girl,</i> the toughest ship afloat, and when I set foot on the
docks, strong men hunt cover! I&mdash;"</p>

<p>I suddenly noticed my tongue was getting thick and my head was
swimming. The mandarin wasn't making no attempt to talk. He was
setting staring at me kinda intense-like, and his eyes glittered
through a mist which was beginning to float about me.</p>

<p>"What the heck!" I said stupidly. Then I heaved up with a roar,
and the room reeled around me. "You yeller-bellied bilge-rat!" I
roared drunkenly. "You done doped my grog! You&mdash;"</p>

<p>I grabbed him by the shirt with my left, and dragged him across
the table top, drawing back my right, but before I could bash him
with it, something exploded at the base of my skull, and the lights
went out.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>I MUST HAVE been out a long time. Once or twice I had a
sensation of being tossed and jounced around, and thought I was in
my bunk and a rough sea running, and then again I kinda vaguely
realized that I was bumping over a rutty road in a automobile, and
I had a feeling that I ought to get up and knock somebody's block
off. But mostly I just laid there and didn't know nothing at
all.</p>

<p>When I did finally come to myself, the first thing I discovered
was that my hands and feet was tied with ropes. Then I seen I was
laying on a camp cot in a tent, and a big Chinaman with a rifle was
standing over me. I craned my neck, and seen another man setting on
a pile of silk cushions, and he looked kinda familiar.</p>

<p>At first I didn't recognize him, because now he was dressed in
embroidered silk robes, Chinese style, but then I seen it was the
mandarin. I struggled up to a sitting position, in spite of my
bonds, and addressed him with poignancy and fervor.</p>

<p>"Why," I concluded passionately, "did you dope my licker? Where
am I at? What've you done with me, you scum of a Macao gutter?"</p>

<p>"You are in the camp of General Yun Chei," he said. "I
transported you hither in my automobile while you lay
senseless."</p>

<p>"And who the devil are you?" I demanded.</p>

<p>He gave me a sardonic bow. "I am General Yun Chei, your humble
servant," he said.</p>

<p>"The hell you are!" I commented with a touch of old-world
culture. "You had a nerve, comin' right into Hong Kong."</p>

<p>"The Federalist fools are blind," he said. "Often I play my own
spy."</p>

<p>"But what'd you kidnap <i>me</i> for?" I yelled with passion,
jerking at my cords till the veins stood out on my temples. "I
can't pay no cussed ransom."</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard of General Feng?" he asked.</p>

<p>"And what if I has?" I snarled, being in no mood for
riddles.</p>

<p>"He is camped nearby," said he. "He is a white foreign-devil
like yourself. You have heard his nickname&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Well?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"He is a man of great strength and violent passions," said
General Yun. "He has acquired a following more because of his
personal fighting ability than because of his intellect. Whomever
he strikes with his fists falls senseless to the ground. So the
soldiers call him General Ironfist.</p>

<p>"Now, he and I have temporarily allied our forces, because our
mutual enemy, General Whang Shan, is somewhere in the vicinity.
General Whang has a force greater than ours, and he likewise
possesses an airplane, which he flies himself. We do not know
exactly where he is, but, on the other hand, he does not know our
position, either, and we are careful to guard against spies. No one
leaves or enters our camp without special permission.</p>

<p>"Though Feng and myself are temporary allies, there is no love
lost between us, and he constantly seeks to undermine my prestige
with my men. To protect myself I must retaliate&mdash;not so as to
precipitate trouble between our armies, but in such a way as to
make him lose face.</p>

<p>"General Feng boasts that he can conquer any man in China with
his naked fists, and he has frequently dared me to pit my hardiest
captains against him for the sheer sport of it. He well knows that
no man in my army could stand up against him, and his arrogance
lowers my prestige. So I went secretly to Hong Kong to find a man
who might have a fighting chance against him. I contemplated the
Yellow Typhoon, but when you laid him low with a single stroke, I
knew you were the man for whom I was looking. I have many friends
in Hong Kong. Drugging you was easy. The first time a pre-arranged
noise at the door distracted your attention. But that was not
enough, so I contrived to dope your second drink under cover of my
sleeve. By the holy dragon, you had enough drug in you to have
overcome an elephant before you succumbed!</p>

<p>"But here you are. I shall present you to General Feng, before
all the captains, and challenge him to make good his boast. He
cannot with honor refuse; and if you beat him, he will lose face,
and my prestige will rise accordingly, because you represent
me."</p>

<p>"And what do I get out of it?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"If you win," he said, "I will send you back to Hong Kong with a
thousand American dollars."</p>

<p>"And what if I lose?" I said.</p>

<p>"Ah," he smiled bleakly, "a man whose head has been removed by
the executioner's sword has no need of money."</p>

<p>I burst into a cold sweat and sot in silent meditation.</p>

<p>"Do you agree?" he asked at last.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know what choice I got," I snarled. "Take these
here cords offa me and gimme some grub. I won't fight for nobody on
a empty belly."</p>

<p>He clapped his hands, and the soldier cut my cords with his
bayonet, and another menial come in with a big dish of mutton stew
and some bread and rice wine, so I fell to and lapped it all up in
a hurry.</p>

<p>"As a token of appreciation," said General Yun, "I now make you
a present of this unworthy trinket."</p>

<p>And he hauled out the finest watch I ever seen and give it to
me.</p>

<p>"If the gift pleases you," he said, noting my gratification,
"let it nerve your thews against General Ironfist."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that," I said, admiring the watch, which was
gold with dragons carved on it. "I'll bust him so hard he'll be
loopin' the loop for a week."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" beamed General Yun. "If you could contrive to deal
him a fatal injury during the combat, it could simplify matters
greatly. But come! I shall tangle General Feng in his own web!"</p>

<p>I FOLLERED HIM out of the tent, and seen a lot of other tents
and ragged soldiers drilling amongst 'em, and off to one side
another camp with more yeller-bellied gunmen in it. It was still
kinda early in the morning, and I gathered it had tooken us all
night to get there in Yun's auto. We was away up in the hills, and
they was no sign of civilization anywheres.</p>

<p>General Yun headed straight for a big tent in the middle of the
camp, and I follered him in. A lot of officers in all kinds of
uniforms riz and bowed, except one big man who sot on a camp stool.
He was a white man in faded khaki and boots and a sun helmet; his
fists was as big as mauls, and his hairy arms was thick with
muscles. His face and corded neck was burned brick-colored by the
sun, and he wore a expression like he habitually hankered for
somebody to give him a excuse to slug 'em.</p>

<p>"General Yun&mdash;" he begun in a harsh voice, then stopped and
glared at me. "What the hell are you doing here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Joel Ballerin!" I said, staring at him. I might of knowed.
Wherever they was war, you'd usually find Joel Ballerin right in
the middle of it. He was from South Australia, and had a natural
instinct for carnage. He was famed as a fighting man all over South
Africa, Australia and the South Seas. Gunrunner, blackbirder,
smuggler, pirate, pearler, or what have you, but always a scrapper
from the word go, with a constant hankering to bounce his enormous
fists offa somebody's conk. I'd never fit him, but I'd saw some of
his handiwork. The ruin he could make of a human carcass was plumb
appalling.</p>

<p>He glared at me with no love, because I got considerable
reputation as a man-mauler myself, and fighting men is jealous of
each other's fame. I couldst feel my own short hairs bristle as I
glared at him.</p>

<p>"You have boasted much of your prowess with the clenched fist,"
said Yun Chei, softly. "You have repeatedly assured me that there
was not a man in my army, including my unworthy self, whom you
could not subdue with ease. I have here one of my followers whom I
venture to back against you."</p>

<p>"That's Steve Costigan, an American sailor," snarled Ballerin.
"He's no man of yours."</p>

<p>"On the contrary!" said General Yun. "Do you not see that he
wears my dragon watch, entrusted only to my loyal henchmen?"</p>

<p>"Well," growled Ballerin, "there's something fishy about this.
When you bring that cabbage-eared gorilla up here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hey!" I said indignantly. "You cease heavin' them insults
around! If you ain't got the guts to fight, why, say so!"</p>

<p>"Why, you blasted fool!" he roared, jumping up off his stool
like it was red hot. "I'll break your infernal head right here and
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>General Yun got between us and smiled blandly and said, "Let us
be dignified in all things. Let it be a public exhibition. I fear
this tent would not prove a proper arena for two such gladiators. I
shall have a ring constructed at once."</p>

<p>Ballerin turned away, grunting, "All right; fix it any way you
want to." Then he wheeled back, his eyes flaming, and snarled at
me, "As for you, you Yankee ape, you're going out of this camp
feet-first!"</p>

<p>"Big talk don't bust no chins," I retorted. "I never did like
you anyway, you nigger-stealin' pearl-thief!"</p>

<p>He looked like he was going to bust some blood-vessels, but he
just give a ferocious snarl and plunged out of the tent. General
Yun motioned me to foller him, and his officers tagged after us.
The others follered General Feng. They didn't seem to be no love
lost betwixt them two armies.</p>

<p>"General Ironfist is caught in his own snare!" gurgled General
Yun, hugging hisself with glee. "He lusts for battle, but is
furious and suspicious because I trapped him into it. All the men
of both armies shall see his downfall. Call in the patrols from the
hills! General Ironfist! Ha!"</p>

<p>GENERAL YUN DIDN'T take me back to his tent, but he put me in
another'n and told me to holler if I wanted anything. He said I'd
be guarded so's Ballerin couldn't have me bumped off, but I seen I
was as good as a prisoner.</p>

<p>Well, I sot in there, and heard some men come marching up and
surround the tent, and somebody give orders in broken Chinese, and
cussed heartily in English, and I stuck my head out of the door and
hollered, <i>"Soapy</i>!"</p>

<p>There he was, all right, commanding the guard, with a old
British army coat three sizes too small for him, and a sword three
sizes too big. He nigh dropped his sword when he seen me, and
bellered, "Steve! What you doin' here?"</p>

<p>"I come up to lick Joel Ballerin for Yun Chei," I said. And he
said, "So that's why they're buildin' that ring! Nobody but the
highest officers knows what's goin' on."</p>

<p>"What you doin' here?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Aw," he said, "I got tired tendin' bar and decided to become a
soldier of fortune. So I skipped to Hong Kong and beat it up into
the hills and joined Yun Chei. But Steve, the life ain't what it's
cracked up to be. I don't mind the fightin' much, cause it's mostly
yellin' and shootin' and little damage done, but marchin' through
these hills is hell, and the food is lousy. We don't get paid
regular, and no place to spend the dough when we do get it. For ten
cents I'd desert."</p>

<p>"Well, lissen," I said, "I got a letter for you." I reached into
my britches pocket, and then I give a yelp. "I been rolled!" I
hollered. "It's gone!"</p>

<p>"What?" he said.</p>

<p>"Your letter," I said. "I was lookin' for you to give it to you.
It come to the American Bar at Tainan. A letter from the Ormond and
Ashley law firm, 'Frisco."</p>

<p>"What was in it?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"How should I know?" I returned irritably. "I didn't open it. I
thought maybe somebody had left you a lot of dough, or
somethin'."</p>

<p>"I've heard pa say he had wealthy relatives," said Soapy,
doubtfully. "Look again, Steve."</p>

<p>"I've looked," I said. "It ain't here. I bet Yun Chei took it
offa me whilst I was out. I'll go over and bust him on the
jaw&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait!" hollered Soapy. "You'll get us both shot! You ain't
supposed to leave this tent, and I got to guard you."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "t'aint likely they was any money in the letter.
Likely they was just tellin' you where to go to get the dough. I
remember the address, and when I get back to Hong Kong, I'll write
and tell 'em I got you located."</p>

<p>"That's a long time to wait," said Soapy, pessimistically.</p>

<p>"Not so long," I said. "As soon as I lick Ballerin, I'll start
for Hong Kong&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you won't," said Soapy. "No ways soon, anyhow."</p>

<p>"What d'you mean?" I asked. "Yun said he'd send me back if I
licked Ballerin."</p>

<p>"He didn't say when, did he?" inquired Soapy. "He ain't goin' to
take no chance of you going back and talkin' and revealin' our
position to Whang's spies. No, sir; he'll keep you prisoner till
he's ready to change camp, and that may be six months."</p>

<p>"Me stay in this dump six months?" I exclaimed fiercely. "I
won't do it!"</p>

<p>"Maybe you won't at that," he said cheeringly. "A lot of things
can happen unexpected around a rebel Chinee camp. I see you're
wearin' Yun Chei's dragon watch."</p>

<p>"Yeah," I said. "Ain't it a beaut? Yun Chei give it to me."</p>

<p>"Well" he said, "that watch has been give away before, but it
has a way of comin' back to Yun Chei after the owner's demise,
which is generally sudden and frequent. Four men that I know of has
already been made a present of that watch, and none of 'em is now
alive."</p>

<p>"The hell you say!" I said, beginning to perspire copiously.
"This is a nice, friendly place I got into. Do <i>you</i> want to
stay here?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't!" he replied bitterly. "I didn't want to before,
and when I thinks they's maybe a million dollars waitin' somewhere
for me to spend, I feels like throwin' down this fool sword and
headin' for the coast."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "I ain't goin' to spend no six months here. Yet
I wants that thousand bucks. Let's us make a break tonight, after I
collects."</p>

<p>"They'd run us down before we'd went far," he said despondently.
"I got one of the few good horses in camp, but it couldn't carry us
both at any kind of a clip. All the other nags are fastened up and
guarded so nobody can desert and carry news of our whereabouts to
General Whang, which would give a leg to know, so he could raid us.
Yun Chei knows he can trust me not to, because Whang wants to cut
off my head. I stole a batch of his eatin' chickens onst when we
was fightin' him over near Kauchau."</p>

<p>"Well," I begun hotly, "I'll be derned if <i>I'm</i> goin'
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shhh!" he said. "We got to change guard now; here comes the
other squad. I'm goin' off somewheres and think."</p>

<p>Another gang of Chinamen come up with a native officer in
charge, and Soapy and his men marched off, and I sot and wound my
dragon watch, and tried to think of something, but didn't have no
success, as usual.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>TIME DRAGGED SLOW, but finally about the middle of the
afternoon, a mob of captains or something come and led me out of
the tent and escorted me to the ring which had been built about
halfway between the camps. They was already a solid bank of
soldiers around it, Yun Chei's on one side and General Feng's on
the other, with their rifles. The ring was just four posts stuck in
the ground, with ropes stretched between 'em, and a bare floor of
boards elevated maybe a yard or more. General Yun was setting in a
camp chair on one side, with his officers around him, and a big
Chinee, which was naked to the waist, was standing right behind
him. The other officers and the common soldiers of both armies sot
on the ground or stood up.</p>

<p>I didn't see Soapy nowheres, and they wasn't no seconds nor
handlers. The Chineses didn't know nothing about such things. I
clumb into the ring and examined the ropes, which was too loose,
for one thing, and the floor, which was solid enough but none too
even, and no padding of any kind on it. They had had sense enough
to put camp stools in the corners, so I shed my cap, coat and
shirt, and sot down. General Yun then riz and come over to me and
smiled gently and said, "Smite the dog as you smote the Yellow
Typhoon. If you lose the fight, you will lose your head in this
very ring."</p>

<p>"I ain't goin' to lose," I snarled, being fed up on that kind of
talk, and he smiled benevolently and retired to his chair. Just
then somebody yanked my pants leg, and I looked down and seen
Soapy. He was shaking with excitement.</p>

<p>"Don't talk, Steve!" he whispered. "Just lissen! Yun Chei thinks
I'm encouragin' you for the battle. But lissen: I've fixed it! I
got wind of a Federal army camped in a valley to the south. They
don't know nothin' about us, but I found a man who swore I could
trust him, and I smuggled him off on my horse. He'll guide 'em back
here, and they'll break up this den of thieves. When the shootin'
starts, we'll duck and run for the Federal lines. I sent my man
right after I talked to you this mornin', so they oughta get here
in maybe an hour or so."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "I hope they don't get here too soon; I want to
collect my thousand bucks from Yun Chei before I run."</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to snoop amongst Feng's men," he hissed, and just
then the crowd on the opposite side of the ring divided, and here
come Feng hisself, alias Joel Ballerin.</p>

<p>He was stripped to the waist, and he wore his fighting scowl.
His short blond hair bristled, and his men sent up a cheer. He
<i>was</i> big, and well built for speed and power. He had broad,
square shoulders, a big arching chest, and a heavy neck, and his
muscles fairly bulged under his sun-reddened skin with every move
he made. He stood square on his wide-braced legs, and they showed
plenty of power and drive. He was a fraction of a inch taller'n me,
and weighed about 200 to my 190, all bone and muscle and
hellfire.</p>

<p>Looking back on that fight, it was one of the strangest I ever
mixed in. They wasn't no referee. They was a Chinaman who whanged a
gong every now and then when he remembered to, but he wasn't
no-ways consistent in his time-keeping. Some of the rounds lasted
thirty seconds and some lasted nine or ten minutes. When one of us
went down, they wasn't no counting. The idea was that we should
just keep on battling till one of us wasn't able to get up at all.
We hadn't no gloves. Bare knuckles don't jolt like the mitts, but
they cut and bruise. It's hard to knock out a tough man in good
condition with one lick or half a dozen licks of your bare maulers.
You got to plumb butcher him.</p>

<p>They was few preliminaries. Ballerin vaulted into the ring,
kicked his stool through the ropes, and yelled, "Hit that gong, Wu
Shang!" Wu Shang hit it, and Ballerin come for me like a cross
between a bucking bronco and a China typhoon.</p>

<p>We met in the center of the ring like a thunder-clap, and his
first lick split my left cauliflower, and my first clout laid his
jaw open to the bone. After that it was slaughter and massacre.</p>

<p>There wasn't nothing fancy about our battling. It was toe to
toe, and breast to breast, bare knuckles crunching against muscle
and bone. Before the first round was over we was slipping in smears
of our own blood. In the second Ballerin nearly fractured my jaw
with a blazing left hook that stretched me on the floor. But I was
up and slugging like mad at the bell. We begun the third by rushing
from our corners with such fury that we had a head-on collision
which dumped us both to the boards nigh senseless. Ballerin's scalp
was laid open, and my head had a bump on it as big as a egg. The
Chineses screamed with amazement, seeing us both writhing on the
floor, but we staggered up about the same time and begun swinging
at each other when Wu Shang got rattled and hit the gong.</p>

<p>AT THE BEGINNING of the fourth I started bombarding Ballerin's
mid-section whilst he pounded my head till my ears was ringing like
all the ship bells in Frisco harbor, and the blood got in my eyes
till I couldn't see and was hitting by instinct. I could hear him
gasping and panting as my iron maulers sunk deeper and deeper into
his suffering belly, and finally, with a maddened roar, he grappled
me and throwed me, and, setting astraddle of me, begun pounding my
head against the boards, to the great glee of his warriors.</p>

<p>As Wu Shang seemed inclined to let that round go on forever, I
resorted to some longshoreman tactics myself, kicked lustily in the
back of the head, arched my body and throwed him off of me, and
pasted him beautifully in the eye as he riz.</p>

<p>This reduced his available sight by half, and didn't improve his
temper none, as he proved by giving vent to a screech like a steam
whistle, and letting go a hurricane swing that caught me under the
ear and wafted me across the ring into the ropes. Them being too
loose, I continued my flight unchecked and lit headfirst in the
laps of the soldiers outside.</p>

<p>I riz and started to climb back through the ropes, necessarily
tromping on my victims as I done so, and one would've stabbed me
with his bayonnet by way of reprisal if I hadn't thoughtfully
kicked him in the jaw first. Then I seen Ballerin crouching at the
ropes, grinning fiercely at me as he dripped blood and weighed his
huge fists, and I seen his intention of socking me as I clumb
through. I said, "Get back from them ropes and let me in, you scum
of the bilge!"</p>

<p>"That's up to you, you wind-jamming baboon!" he laughed
brutally. So I unexpectedly reached through the ropes and grabbed
his ankle and dumped him on his neck, and before he could rise, I
was back in the ring. He riz ravening, and just then Wu Shang
decided to hit the gong.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the fifth we came together and slugged till
we was blind and deaf and dizzy, and when we finally heard the
gong, we dropped in our tracks and lay there side by side, gasping
for breath, till the gong announced the opening of the sixth, and
we riz up and started in where we'd left off.</p>

<p>We was exchanging lefts and rights like a hail storm when he
brung one up from the floor so fast I never seen it coming. The
first part of me that hit the boards was the back of my head, and
it nigh caved in the floor. I riz and tore into him, slugging with
frenzied abandon, and battered him back across the ring, but I was
so blind I missed him as he side-stepped, and fell into the ropes,
and he smashed me three times behind the ear, and then, as I
wheeled groggily, he caught me square on the button with a most
awful right swing. <i>Wham!</i> I don't remember falling, but I
must of, because the next thing I knowed I was down on the boards
and Ballerin was stomping in my ribs with his boots. Away off I
could hear Wu Shang banging his gong, but Ballerin give no heed,
and I felt myself slipping into dreamland.</p>

<p>Then my blood-misted gaze, wandering at random, rested on
General Yun in his camp chair. He smiled at me grimly, and that
half-naked Chinaman behind him drawed a great curved sword and run
his thumb along the edge.</p>

<p>With a howl of desperation I steadied my tottering brain, and I
fought my way to my feet in spite of all Ballerin could do, and I
pasted him with a left that tore his ear nearly off his head, and
he went reeling into the ropes. He come back with a roar and a
tremendous clout that missed me and splintered one of the ring
posts, and I heaved my right under his heart with all my beef
behind it. I heard a couple of his ribs crack under it, and I
follered it with a hurricane of lefts and rights that drove him
staggering before me like a ship in a typhoon. A thundering right
to the head bent him back over the ropes, and then, just as I was
setting myself for the finisher, I felt somebody jerking my pants
leg and heard Soapy hollering to me amidst the roar of the mob,
"Steve! Ballerin's got fifty rifles trained on you right now. If
you drop him, you'll never leave that ring alive."</p>

<p>I SHOOK THE blood outa my eyes and cast a desperate glare over
my shoulder. The front ranks of General Feng's warriors still
leaned on their rifles, but behind 'em I caught a glimmer of black
muzzles.</p>

<p>Ballerin pitched off the ropes, swinging a wild overhand right
that missed by a yard, and he would of tumbled to the boards if I
hadn't grabbed him and held him up.</p>

<p>"What'm I goin' to do?" I howled. "If I don't drop him, Yun
Chei'll cut off my head, and if I do, his men'll shoot me!"</p>

<p>"Stall, Steve!" begged Soapy. "Keep it up as long as you can;
somethin' might happen any minute now."</p>

<p>I cast a glance at the sun, and sweated with despair. But I held
Ballerin up as long as I dared, and then I pushed him away from me
and swung wide at him. He reeled and I tried to catch him, but he
pitched face-first, and I ducked as I heard a click of rifle bolts.
But he was trying to climb up again, and I never hoped to see a
opponent rise like I hoped to see him rise. He grabbed the ropes
and hauled hisself up, and stared around, one eye closed and
t'other glassy.</p>

<p>He was out on his feet, but his fighting instinct kept him
going. He come blundering out into the ring, swinging blind, and I
swung wide, but he fell into it somehow, and I hit him in spite of
myself. Soapy give a lamentable howl, and Ballerin pitched back
into the ropes, and I was on him and locked him in a despairing
grasp before he could fall. He was dead weight in my arms, out
cold, his legs dragging, and I was so near out myself I wondered
how long I couldst hold him up. Over his shoulder I see General Yun
looking at me impatient; even a Chinese revolutionist could see
that was ready for the cleaners. But I held on; if I let go, I
knowed Ballerin wouldn't get up again, and his men would start
target practice on me.</p>

<p>Then above the noise of the crowd I heard a low roar. I looked
out over their heads, and beyond the ridge of a distant hill
something come soaring. It was a airplane, and nobody but me had
seen it. I wrestled my limp victim to the ropes, and gasped the
news to Soapy. He was too smart to look, but he hissed, "Keep
stallin'! Hold him up! The Federals have sent a plane to our
rescue! Everything's jake!"</p>

<p>General Yun had got suspicious. He jumped up and shook his fist
at me, and hollered, and his derned executioner grinned and drawed
his sword again&mdash;and then, with a rush and zoom, the airplane
swooped down on us like a hawk. Everybody looked up and yelled, and
as it passed right over the ring, I seen something tumble from it
and flash in the sun. And Soapy yelled, "Look out! There's a dragon
painted on it! That ain't a Federal plane&mdash;that's <i>Whang
Shan</i>!"</p>

<p>I throwed Ballerin bodily over the ropes as far as I could heave
him, and div after him, and the next
instant&mdash;<i>blam!</i>&mdash;the ring went up in smoke, and
pieces flew every which way.</p>

<p>BOMBS WAS FALLING and crashing and tents going sky-high, and men
yelling and shooting and running and falling over each other, and
the roar of that cussed plane was in my ears as I headed for the
tall timber. I was vaguely aware that Soapy was legging it
alongside me, hollering, "That Chinaman of mine never went to the
Federals, the dirty rat! I see it all now! He was one of Whang
Shan's spies. No wonder he was so anxious to help! He wanted my
horse&mdash;hey, Steve! This way!"</p>

<p>I seen Soapy do a running dive into General Yun's auto, which
was setting in front of his tent, and I follered him. We went
roaring away just as a bomb hit where the car had been a second
before, and spattered us with dirt. I dunno where General Yun was,
though I caught a glimpse of a silk-robed figure, which might of
been him, scudding for the hills.</p>

<p>We went through that camp like a tornado, with all hell popping
behind us. Whang was sure giving his enemies the works in that one
plane of his'n. They was such punk shots they couldn't hit him with
their rifles, and all he had to do was heave bombs into the thick
of 'em.</p>

<p>I don't remember much about that ride. Soapy was hanging to the
wheel and pushing the accelerator through the floor, and I was
holding onto the seat and trying to stay with the derned craft
which was bucking over that awful road like a skiff in a squall.
Presently we hit a bump that throwed me clean over the seat into
the back, and when I come up for air I had something clutched in my
hand, at the sight of which I give a yell of joy&mdash;and bit my
tongue savagely as we hit another bump.</p>

<p>I clumb back into the front seat like I was crawling along the
cross-trees of the main-mast in a typhoon, and tried to tell Soapy
what I'd found, but we was going so fast the wind blowed the words
clean outa my mouth.</p>

<p>It wasn't till we had dropped down out of the higher hills along
about sundown and was coasting along a comparatively better road
amongst fields and mud huts that I got a chance to catch my
breath.</p>

<p>"I found your letter," I said. "It was in the bottom of the car.
It must of slipped outa my pocket whilst I was tied up."</p>

<p>"Read it to me," he requested, and I said, "Wait till I see is
my watch intact. I didn't get my thousand bucks for lickin'
Ballerin, and I want to be sure I got <i>somethin</i>, for goin'
through what I been through."</p>

<p>So I looked at the watch, which must of been worth five hundred
dollars anyway, and it was unscratched, so I opened the letter and
read:</p>

<p class="letter">"Ormond and Ashley, attorneys at law, San
Francisco, California, U. S. A. Dear Mister Jackson: This is to
inform you that you are being sued by Mrs. J. A. Lynch for a nine
months board bill, amounting to exactly&mdash;"</p>

<p>Soapy give a ear-splitting yell and wrenched the wheel over.</p>

<p>"What you doin', you idjit?" I howled, as the car r'ared and
skidded and lurched around like a skiff in a tide-rip.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' back to Yun Chei!" he screeched. "My expectations is
bust! I thought I was a heiress, but I'm still a bum! I ain't got
the&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Crash!</i> We left the road, rammed a tree, and went into a
perfect tailspin.</p>

<p>The evening shadders was falling as I crawled out from under the
debris and untangled one of the wheels from around my neck. I
looked about for Soapy's remains, and seen 'em setting on a busted
headlight, brooding somberly.</p>

<p>"You might at least ask if I'm hurt," I said resentfully.</p>

<p>"What of it?" he asked bitterly. "We're ruined. I ain't got no
fortune."</p>

<p>"I was ruined when I first met a hoodoo like you," I said
fiercely. "Anyway, I still got Yun Chei's watch." And I reached
into my pocket. And then I gave a poignant shriek. That watch must
of absorbed the whole jolt of the smash. I had a handful of metal
scraps and wheels and springs which nobody could tell was they
meant for a watch or what. Thereafter, a figure might have been
seen flitting through the twilight, hotly pursued by another,
bulkier figure, breathing threats of vengeance, in the general
direction of the coast.</p>
