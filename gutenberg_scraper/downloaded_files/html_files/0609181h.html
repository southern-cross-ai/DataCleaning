<p class="first">NO SOONER had the <i>Sea Girl</i> docked in
Yokohama than Mushy Hansen beat it down the waterfront to see if he
couldst match me at some good fight club. Purty soon he come back
and said: "No chance, Steve. You'd have to be a Scandinavian to get
a scrap right now."</p>

<p>"What you mean by them remarks?" I asked, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mushy, "the sealin' fleet's in, and so likewise is
the whalers, and the port's swarmin' with squareheads."</p>

<p>"Well, what's that got to do&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"They ain't but one fight club on the waterfront," said Mushy,
"and it's run by a Dutchman named Neimann. He's been puttin' on a
series of elimination contests, and, from what I hear, he's been
cleanin' up. He matches Swedes against Danes, see? Well, they's
hundreds of squareheads in port, and naturally each race turns out
to support its countryman. So far, the Danes is ahead. You ever
hear of Hakon Torkilsen?"</p>

<p>"You bet," I said. "I ain't never seen him perform, but they say
he's the real goods. Sails on the <i>Viking</i>, outa Copenhagen,
don't he?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. And the <i>Viking's</i> in port. Night before last, Hakon
flattened Sven Tortvigssen, the Terrible Swede, in three rounds,
and tonight he takes on Dirck Jacobsen, the Gotland Giant. The
Swedes and the Danes is fightin' all over the waterfront," said
Mushy, "and they're bettin' their socks. I sunk a few bucks on
Hakon myself. But that's the way she stands, Steve. Nobody but
Scandinavians need apply."</p>

<p>"Well, heck," I complained, "how come I got to be the victim of
race prejerdice? I need dough. I'm flat broke. Wouldn't this mug
Neimann gimme a preliminary scrap? For ten dollars I'll fight any
three squareheads in port&mdash;all in the same ring."</p>

<p>"Naw," said Mushy, "they ain't goin' to be no preliminaries.
Neimann says the crowd'll be too impatient to set through 'em. Boy,
oh boy, will they be excitement! Whichever way it goes, they's
bound to be a rough-house."</p>

<p>"A purty lookout," I said bitterly, "when the <i>Sea Girl,</i>
the fightenest ship on the seven seas, ain't represented in the
melee. I gotta good mind to blow in and bust up the whole
show&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment Bill O'Brien hove in sight, looking excited.</p>

<p>"Hot dawg!" he yelled. "Here's a chance for us to clean up some
dough!"</p>

<p>"Stand by to come about," I advised, "and give us the lay."</p>

<p>"Well," Bill said, "I just been down along the waterfront
listening to them squareheads argy&mdash;and, boy, is the money
changin' hands! I seen six fights already. Well, just now they come
word that Dirck Jacobsen had broke his wrist, swinging for a
sparrin' partner and hittin' the wall instead. So I run down to
Neimann's arena to find out if it was so, and the Dutchman was
walkin' the floor and tearin' his hair. He said he'd pay a hundred
bucks extra, win or lose, to a man good enough to go in with
Torkilsen. He says if he calls the show off, these squareheads will
hang him. So I see where we can run a <i>Sea Girl</i> man in and
cop the jack!"</p>

<p>"And who you think we can use?" I asked skeptically.</p>

<p>"Well, there's Mushy," began Bill. "He was raised in America, of
course, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yeah, there's Mushy!" snapped Mushy, bitterly. "You know as
well as I do that I ain't no Swede. I'm a Dane myself. Far from
wantin' to fight Hakon, I hope he knocks the block offa whatever
fool Swede they finds to go against him."</p>

<p>"That's gratitude," said Bill, scathingly. "How can a brainy man
like me work up anything big when I gets opposition from all
quarters? I lays awake nights studyin' up plans for the betterment
of my mates, and what do I get? Argyments! Wisecracks! Opposition!
I tellya&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw, pipe down," I said. "There's Sven Larson&mdash;he's a
Swede."</p>

<p>"That big ox would last about fifteen seconds against Hakon,"
said Mushy, with gloomy satisfaction. "Besides, Sven's in jail. He
hadn't been in port more'n a half hour when he got jugged for
beatin' up a cop."</p>

<p>Bill fixed a gloomy gaze on me, and his eyes lighted.</p>

<p>"Hot dawg!" he whooped. "I got it! Steve, you're a Swede!"</p>

<p>"Listen here, you flat-headed dogfish," I began, in ire, "me and
you ain't had a fight in years, but by golly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw, try to have some sense," said Bill. "This is the idee: You
ain't never fought in Yokohama before. Neimann don't know you, nor
anybody else. We'll pass you off for Swede&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pass <i>him</i> off for a Swede?" gawped Mushy.</p>

<p>"Well," said Bill, "I'll admit he don't look much like a
Swede&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Much</i> like a Swede!" I gnashed, my indignation mounting.
"Why, you son of a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you don't look <i>nothin</i>' like a Swede then!" snapped
Bill, disgustedly, "but we can pass you off for one. I reckon if we
tell 'em you're a Swede, they can't prove you ain't. If they
dispute it, we'll knock the daylights outa 'em."</p>

<p>I thought it over.</p>

<p>"Not so bad," I finally decided. "We'll get that hundred
extra&mdash;and, for a chance to fight somebody, I'd purtend I was
a Eskimo. We'll do it."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Bill. "Can you talk Swedish?"</p>

<p>"Sure," I said. "Listen: Yimmy Yackson yumped off the
Yacob-ladder with his monkey-yacket on. Yimminy, what a yump!"</p>

<p>"Purty good," said Bill. "Come on, we'll go down to Neimann's
and sign up. Hey, ain't you goin', Mushy?"</p>

<p>"No, I ain't," said Mushy sourly. "I see right now I ain't goin'
to enjoy this scrap none. Steve's my shipmate but Hakon's my
countryman. Whichever loses, I won't rejoice none. I hope it's a
draw. I ain't even goin' to see it."</p>

<p>Well, he went off by hisself, and I said to Bill, "I gotta good
mind not to go on with this, since Mushy feels that way about
it."</p>

<p>"Aw, he'll get over it," said Bill. "My gosh, Steve, this here's
a matter of business. Ain't we all busted? Mushy'll feel all right
after we split your purse three ways and he has a few shots of hard
licker."</p>

<p>"Well, all right," I said. "Let's get down to Neimann's."</p>

<p>So me and Bill and my white bulldog, Mike, went down to
Neimann's, and, as we walked in, Bill hissed, "Don't forget to talk
Swedish."</p>

<p>A short, fat man, which I reckoned was Neimann, was setting and
looking over a list of names, and now and then he'd take a long
pull out of a bottle, and then he'd cuss fit to curl your toes, and
pull his hair.</p>

<p>"Well, Neimann," said Bill, cheerfully, "what you doin'?"</p>

<p>"I got a list of all the Swedes in port which think they can
fight," said Neimann, bitterly. "They ain't one of 'em would last
five seconds against Torkilsen. I'll have to call it off."</p>

<p>"No you won't," said Bill. "Right here I got the fightin'est
Swede in the Asiatics!"</p>

<p>Neimann faced around quick to look at me, and his eyes flared,
and he jumped up like he'd been stung.</p>

<p>"Get outa here!" he yelped. "You should come around here and
mock me in my misery! A sweet time for practical jokes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw, cool off," said Bill. "I tell you this Swede can lick Hakon
Torkilsen with his right thumb in his mouth."</p>

<p>"Swede!" snorted Neimann. "You must think I'm a prize sucker,
bringin' this black-headed mick around here and tellin'
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mick, baloney!" said Bill. "Lookit them blue eyes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm lookin' at 'em," snarled Neimann, "and thinkin' of the
lakes of Killarney all the time. Swede? Ha! Then so was Jawn L.
Sullivan. So you're a Swede, are you?"</p>

<p>"Sure," I said. "Aye bane Swedish, Mister."</p>

<p>"What part of Sweden?" he barked.</p>

<p>"Gotland," I said, and simultaneous Bill said, "Stockholm," and
we glared at each other in mutual irritation.</p>

<p>"Cork, you'd better say," sneered Neimann.</p>

<p>"Aye am a Swede," I said, annoyed. "Aye want dass fight."</p>

<p>"Get outa here and quit wastin' my valuable time," snarled
Neimann. "If you're a Swede, then I'm a Hindoo Princess!"</p>

<p>At this insulting insinuation I lost my temper. I despises a man
that's so suspicious he don't trust his feller men. Grabbing
Neimann by the neck with a viselike grip, and waggling a huge fist
under his nose, I roared, "You insultin' monkey! Am I a Swede or
ain't I?"</p>

<p>He turned pale and shook like an aspirin-leaf.</p>

<p>"You're a Swede," he agreed, weakly.</p>

<p>"And I get the fight?" I rumbled.</p>

<p>"You get it," he agreed, wiping his brow with a bandanner. "The
squareheads may stretch my neck for this, but maybe, if you keep
your mouth shut, we'll get by. What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Steve&mdash;" I began, thoughtlessly, when Bill kicked me on
the shin and said, "Lars Ivarson."</p>

<p>"All right," said Neimann, pessimistically, "I'll announce it
that I got a man to fight Torkilsen."</p>

<p>"How much do I&mdash;how much Aye bane get?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I guaranteed a thousand bucks to the fighters," he said, "to be
split seven hundred to the winner and three hundred to the
loser."</p>

<p>"Give me das loser's end now," I demanded. "Aye bane go out and
bet him, you betcha life."</p>

<p>So he did, and said, "You better keep offa the street; some of
your countrymen might ask you about the folks back home in dear old
Stockholm." And, with that, he give a bitter screech of raucous and
irritating laughter, and slammed the door; and as we left, we
heered him moaning like he had the bellyache.</p>

<p>"I don't believe he thinks I'm a Swede," I said,
resentfully.</p>

<p>"Who cares?" said Bill. "We got the match. But he's right. I'll
go place the bets. You keep outa sight. Long's you don't say much,
we're safe. But, if you go wanderin' around, some squarehead'll
start talkin' Swedish to you and we'll be sunk."</p>

<p>"All right," I said. "I'll get me a room at the sailor's
boardin' house we seen down Manchu Road. I'll stay there till it's
time for the scrap."</p>

<p>So Bill went off to lay the bets, and me and Mike went down the
back alleys toward the place I mentioned. As we turned out of a
side street into Manchu Road, somebody come around the corner
moving fast, and fell over Mike, who didn't have time to get outa
the way.</p>

<p>The feller scrambled up with a wrathful roar. A big blond bezark
he was, and he didn't look like a sailor. He drawed back his foot
to kick Mike, as if it was the dog's fault. But I circumvented him
by the simple process of kicking him severely on the shin.</p>

<p>"Drop it, cull," I growled, as he begun hopping around, howling
wordlessly and holding his shin. "It wasn't Mike's fault, and you
hadn't no cause to kick him. Anyhow, he'd of ripped yore laig off
if you'd landed&mdash;"</p>

<p>Instead of being pacified, he gave a bloodthirsty yell and
socked me on the jaw. Seeing he was one of them bull-headed mugs
you can't reason with, I banged him once with my right, and left
him setting dizzily in the gutter picking imaginary violets.</p>

<p>Proceeding on my way to the seamen's boardin's house, I forgot
all about the incident. Such trifles is too common for me to spend
much time thinking about. But, as it come out, I had cause to
remember it.</p>

<p>I got me a room and stayed there with the door shut till Bill
come in, jubilant, and said the crew of the <i>Sea Girl</i> hadst
sunk all the money it could borrow at heavy odds.</p>

<p>"If you lose," said he, "most of us will go back to the ship
wearin' barrels."</p>

<p>"Me lose?" I snorted disgustedly. "Don't be absurd. Where's the
Old Man?"</p>

<p>"Aw, I seen him down at that dive of antiquity, the Purple Cat
Bar, a while ago," said Bill. "He was purty well lit and havin'
some kind of a argyment with old Cap'n Gid Jessup. He'll be at the
fight all right. I didn't say nothin' to him; but he'll be
there."</p>

<p>"He'll more likely land in jail for fightin' old Gid," I
ruminated. "They hate each other like snakes. Well, that's his own
lookout. But I'd like him to see me lick Torkilsen. I heered him
braggin' about the squarehead the other day. Seems like he seen him
fight once some place."</p>

<p>"Well," said Bill, "it's nearly time for the fight. Let's get
goin'. We'll go down back alleys and sneak into the arena from the
rear, so none of them admirin' Swedes can get ahold of you and find
out you're really a American mick. Come on!"</p>

<p>So we done so, accompanied by three Swedes of the <i>Sea
Girl</i>'s crew who was loyal to their ship and their shipmates. We
snuck along alleys and slunk into the back rooms of the arena,
where Neimann come in to us, perspiring freely, and told us he was
having a heck of a time keeping Swedes outa the dressing-room. He
said numbers of 'em wanted to come in and shake hands with Lars
Ivarson before he went out to uphold the fair name of Sweden. He
said Hakon was getting in the ring, and for us to hustle.</p>

<p>So we went up the aisle hurriedly, and the crowd was so busy
cheering for Hakon that they didn't notice us till we was in the
ring. I looked out over the house, which was packed, setting and
standing, and squareheads fighting to get in when they wasn't room
for no more. I never knowed they was that many Scandinavians in
Eastern waters. It looked like every man in the house was a Dane, a
Norwegian, or a Swede&mdash;big, blond fellers, all roaring like
bulls in their excitement. It looked like a stormy night.</p>

<p>Neimann was walking around the ring, bowing and grinning, and
every now and then his gaze wouldst fall on me as I set in my
corner and he wouldst shudder viserbly and wipe his forehead with
his bandanner.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a big Swedish sea captain was acting the part of the
announcer, and was making quite a ceremony out of it. He wouldst
boom out jovially, and the crowd wouldst roar in various alien
tongues, and I told one of the Swedes from the <i>Sea Girl</i> to
translate for me, which he done so in a whisper, while pertending
to tie on my gloves.</p>

<p>This is what the announcer was saying: "Tonight all Scandinavia
is represented here in this glorious forthcoming struggle for
supremacy. In my mind it brings back days of the Vikings. This is a
Scandinavian spectacle for Scandinavian sailors. Every man involved
in this contest is Scandinavian. You all know Hakon Torkilsen, the
pride of Denmark!" Whereupon, all the Danes in the crowd bellered.
"I haven't met Lars Ivarson, but the very fact that he is a son of
Sweden assures us that he will prove no mean opponent for Denmark's
favored son." It was the Swedes' turn to roar. "I now present the
referee, Jon Yarssen, of Norway! This is a family affair. Remember,
whichever way the fight goes, it will lend glory to
Scandinavia!"</p>

<p>Then he turned and pointed toward the opposite corner and
roared, "Hakon Torkilsen, of Denmark!"</p>

<p>Again the Danes thundered to the skies, and Bill O'Brien hissed
in my ear. "Don't forget when you're interjuiced say 'Dis bane
happiest moment of my life!' The accent will convince 'em you're a
Swede."</p>

<p>The announcer turned toward me and, as his eyes fell on me for
the first time, he started violently and blinked. Then he kind of
mechanically pulled hisself together and stammered, "Lars
Ivarson&mdash;of&mdash;of&mdash;Sweden!"</p>

<p>I riz, shedding my bathrobe, and a gasp went up from the crowd
like they was thunderstruck or something. For a moment a sickening
silence reigned, and then my Swedish shipmates started applauding,
and some of the Swedes and Norwegians took it up, and, like people
always do, got louder and louder till they was lifting the
roof.</p>

<p>Three times I started to make my speech, and three times they
drowned me out, till I run outa my short stock of patience.</p>

<p><i>"Shut up, you lubbers!"</i> I roared, and they lapsed into
sudden silence, gaping at me in amazement. With a menacing scowl, I
said, "Dis bane happiest moment of my life, by thunder!"</p>

<p>They clapped kind of feebly and dazedly, and the referee
motioned us to the center of the ring. And, as we faced each other,
I gaped, and he barked, "Aha!" like a hyena which sees some critter
caught in a trap. The referee was the big cheese I'd socked in the
alley!</p>

<p>I didn't pay much attention to Hakon, but stared morbidly at the
referee, which reeled off the instructions in some Scandinavian
tongue. Hakon nodded and responded in kind, and the referee glared
at me and snapped something and I nodded and grunted, "Ja!" just as
if I understood him, and turned back toward my corner.</p>

<p>He stepped after me, and caught hold of my gloves. Under cover
of examining 'em he hissed, so low my handlers didn't even hear
him, "You are no Swede! I know you. You called your dog 'Mike.'
There is only one white bulldog in the Asiatics by that name! You
are Steve Costigan, of the <i>Sea Girl</i>."</p>

<p>"Keep it quiet," I muttered nervously.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he snarled. "I will have my revenge. Go ahead&mdash;fight
your fight. After the bout is over, I will expose you as the
imposter you are. These men will hang you to the rafters."</p>

<p>"Gee whiz," I mumbled, "what you wanta do that for? Keep my
secret and I'll slip you fifty bucks after the scrap."</p>

<p>He merely snorted, "Ha!" in disdain, pointing meaningly at the
black eye which I had give him, and stalked back to the center of
the ring.</p>

<p>"What did that Norwegian say to you?" Bill O'Brien asked.</p>

<p>I didn't reply. I was kinda wool-gathering. Looking out over the
mob, I admit I didn't like the prospects. I hadst no doubt that
them infuriated squareheads would be maddened at the knowledge that
a alien had passed hisself off as one of 'em&mdash;and they's a
limit to the numbers that even Steve Costigan can vanquish in
mortal combat! But about that time the gong sounded, and I forgot
everything except the battle before me.</p>

<p>For the first time I noticed Hakon Torkilsen, and I realized why
he had such a reputation. He was a regular panther of a man&mdash;a
tall, rangy, beautifully built young slugger with a mane of yellow
hair and cold, steely eyes. He was six feet one to my six feet, and
weighed 185 to my 190. He was trained to the ounce, and his long,
smooth muscles rippled under his white skin as he moved. My black
mane musta contrasted strongly with his golden hair.</p>

<p>He come in fast and ripped a left hook to my head, whilst I come
back with a right to the body which brung him up standing. But his
body muscles was like iron ridges, and I knowed it wouldst take
plenty of pounding to soften him there, even though it was me doing
the pounding.</p>

<p>Hakon was a sharpshooter, and he begunst to shoot his left
straight and fast. All my opponents does, at first, thinking I'm a
sucker for a left jab. But they soon abandons that form of attack.
I ignores left jabs. I now walked through a perfect hail of 'em and
crashed a thundering right under Hakon's heart which brung a
astonished grunt outa him. Discarding his jabbing offensive, he
started flailing away with both hands, and I wanta tell you he
wasn't throwing no powder-puffs!</p>

<p>It was the kind of scrapping I like. He was standing up to me,
giving and taking, and I wasn't called on to run him around the
ring like I gotta do with so many of my foes. He was belting me
plenty, but that's my style, and, with a wide grin, I slugged
merrily at his body and head, and the gong found us in the center
of the ring, banging away.</p>

<p>The crowd give us a roaring cheer as we went back to our
corners, but suddenly my grin was wiped off by the sight of
Yarssen, the referee, cryptically indicating his black eye as he
glared morbidly at me.</p>

<p>I determined to finish Torkilsen as quick as possible, make a
bold break through the crowd, and try to get away before Yarssen
had time to tell 'em my fatal secret. Just as I started to tell
Bill, I felt a hand jerking at my ankle. I looked down into the
bewhiskered, bewildered and bleary-eyed face of the Old Man.</p>

<p>"Steve!" he squawked. "I'm in a terrible jam!"</p>

<p>Bill O'Brien jumped like he was stabbed. "Don't yell 'Steve'
thataway!" he hissed. "You wanta get us all mobbed?"</p>

<p>"I'm in a terrible jam!" wailed the Old Man, wringing his hands.
"If you don't help me, I'm a rooined man!"</p>

<p>"What's the lay?" I asked in amazement, leaning through the
ropes.</p>

<p>"It's Gid Jessup's fault," he moaned. "The serpent got me into a
argyment and got me drunk. He knows I ain't got no sense when I'm
soused. He hornswoggled me into laying a bet on Torkilsen. I didn't
know you was goin' to fight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "that's tough, but you'll just have to lose the
bet."</p>

<p>"I can't!" he howled.</p>

<p><i>Bong!</i> went the gong, and I shot outa my corner as Hakon
ripped outa his.</p>

<p>"I can't lose!" the Old Man howled above the crowd. <i>"I bet
the Sea Girl!"</i></p>

<p>"What!" I roared, momentarily forgetting where I was, and
half-turning toward the ropes. <i>Bang!</i> Hakon nearly tore my
head off with a free-swinging right. Bellering angrily, I come back
with a smash to the mush that started the claret, and we went into
a slug-fest, flailing free and generous with both hands.</p>

<p>That Dane was tough! Smacks that would of staggered most men
didn't make him wince. He come ploughing in for more. But, just
before the gong, I caught him off balance with a blazing left hook
that knocked him into the ropes, and the Swedes arose, whooping
like lions.</p>

<p>Back on my stool I peered through the ropes. The Old Man was
dancing a hornpipe.</p>

<p>"What's this about bettin' the <i>Sea Girl</i>?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"When I come to myself a while ago, I found I'd wagered the
ship," he wept, "against Jessup's lousy tub, the <i>Nigger
King,</i> which I find is been condemned by the shippin' board and
wouldn't clear the bay without goin' to the bottom. He took a
unfair advantage of me! I wasn't responsible when I made that
bet!"</p>

<p>"Don't pay it," I growled, "Jessup's a rat!"</p>

<p>"He showed me a paper I signed while stewed," he groaned. "It's
a contrack upholdin' the bet. If it weren't for that, I wouldn't
pay. But if I don't, he'll rooin my reputation in every port of the
seven seas. He'll show that contrack and gimme the name of a
welsher. You got to lose!"</p>

<p>"Gee whiz!" I said, badgered beyond endurance. "This is a purty
mess&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>Bong!</i> went the gong, and I paced out into the ring, all
upset and with my mind elsewhere. Hakon swarmed all over me, and
drove me into the ropes, where I woke up and beat him off, but,
with the Old Man's howls echoing in my ears, I failed to follow up
my advantage, and Hakon come back strong.</p>

<p>The Danes raised the roof as he battered me about the ring, but
he wasn't hurting me none, because I covered up, and again, just
before the gong, I snapped outa my crouch and sent him back on his
heels with a wicked left hook to the head.</p>

<p>The referee gimme a gloating look, and pointed at his black eye,
and I had to grit my teeth to keep from socking him stiff. I set
down on my stool and listened gloomily to the shrieks of the Old
Man, which was getting more unbearable every minute.</p>

<p>"You got to lose!" he howled. "If Torkilsen don't win this
fight, I'm rooined! If the bet'd been on the level, I'd
pay&mdash;you know that. But, I been swindled, and now I'm goin' to
get robbed! Lookit the rat over there, wavin' that devilish paper
at me! It's more'n human flesh and blood can stand! It's enough to
drive a man to drink! You <i>got</i> to lose!"</p>

<p>"But the boys has bet their shirts on me," I snarled, fit to be
tied with worry and bewilderment. "I can't lay down! I never
throwed a fight. I don't know how&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's gratitood!" he screamed, busting into tears. "After all
I've did for you! Little did I know I was warmin' a serpent in my
bosom! The poorhouse is starin' me in the face, and you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw, shut up, you old sea horse!" said Bill. "Steve&mdash;I mean
Lars&mdash;has got enough to contend with without you howlin' and
yellin' like a maneyack. Them squareheads is gonna get suspicious
if you and him keep talkin' in English. Don't pay no attention to
him, Steve&mdash;I mean Lars. Get that Dane!"</p>

<p>Well, the gong sounded, and I went out all tore up in my mind
and having just about lost heart in the fight. That's a most
dangerous thing to have happen, especially against a man-killing
slugger like Hakon Torkilsen. Before I knowed what was goin' on,
the Swedes rose with a scream of warning and about a million stars
bust in my head. I realized faintly that I was on the canvas, and I
listened for the count to know how long I had to rest.</p>

<p>I heered a voice droning above the roar of the fans, but it was
plumb meaningless to me. I shook my head, and my sight cleared. Jon
Yarssen was standing over me, his arm going up and down, but I
didn't understand a word he said! He was counting in Swedish!</p>

<p>Not daring to risk a moment, I heaved up before my head had
really quit singing an' Hakon come storming in like a typhoon to
finish me.</p>

<p>But I was mad clean through and had plumb forgot about the Old
Man and his fool bet. I met Hakon with a left hook which nearly
tore his head off, and the Swedes yelped with joy. I bored in,
ripping both hands to the wind and heart, and, in a fast mix-up at
close quarters, Hakon went down&mdash;more from a slip than a
punch. But he was wise and took a count, resting on one knee.</p>

<p>I watched the referee's arm so as to familiarize myself with the
sound of the numerals&mdash;but he wasn't counting in the same
langwidge as he had over me! I got it, then; he counted over me in
Swedish and over Hakon in Danish. The langwidges is alike in many
ways, but different enough to get me all mixed up, which didn't
know a word in either tongue, anyhow. I seen then that I was going
to have a enjoyable evening.</p>

<p>Hakon was up at nine&mdash;I counted the waves of the referee's
arm&mdash;and he come up at me like a house afire. I fought him off
half-heartedly, whilst the Swedes shouted with amazement at the
change which had come over me since that blazing first round.</p>

<p>Well, I've said repeatedly that a man can't fight his best when
he's got his mind on something else. Here was a nice mess for me to
worry about. If I quit, l'd be a yeller dog and despize myself for
the rest of my life, and my shipmates would lose their money, and
so would all the Swedes which had bet on me and was now yelling and
cheering for me just like I was their brother. I couldn't throw 'em
down. Yet if I won, the Old Man would lose his ship, which was all
he had and like a daughter to him. It wouldst beggar him and break
his heart. And, as a minor thought, whether I won or lost, that
scut Yarssen was going to tell the crowd I wasn't no Swede, and get
me mobbed. Every time I looked at him over Hakon's shoulder in a
clinch, Yarssen wouldst touch his black eye meaningly. I was bogged
down in gloom, and I wished I could evaporate or something.</p>

<p>Back on my stool, between rounds, the Old Man wept and begged me
to lay down, and Bill and my handlers implored me to wake up and
kill Torkilsen, and I thought I'd go nuts.</p>

<p>I WENT OUT for the fourth round slowly, and Hakon, evidently
thinking I'd lost my fighting heart, if any, come with his usual
tigerish rush and biffed me three times in the face without a
return.</p>

<p>I dragged him into a grizzly-like clinch which he couldn't
break, and as we rassled and strained, he spat something at me
which I couldn't understand, but I understood the tone of it. He
was calling me yellow! Me, Steve Costigan, the terror of the high
seas!</p>

<p>With a maddened roar, I jerked away from him and crashed a
murderous right to his jaw that nearly floored him. Before he
couldst recover his balance, I tore into him like a wild man,
forgetting everything except that I was Steve Costigan, the bully
of the toughest ship afloat.</p>

<p>Slugging right and left, I rushed him into the ropes, where I
pinned him, while the crowd went crazy. He crouched and covered up,
taking most of my punches on the gloves and elbows, but I reckoned
it looked to the mob like I was beating him to death. All at once,
above the roar, I heered the Old Man screaming, "Steve, for cats'
sake, let up! I'll go on the beach, and it'll be your fault!"</p>

<p>That unnerved me. I involuntarily dropped my hands and recoiled,
and Hakon, with fire in his eyes, lunged outa his crouch like a
tiger and crashed his right to my jaw.</p>

<p><i>Bang!</i> I was on the canvas again, and the referee was
droning Swedish numerals over me. Not daring to take a count, and
maybe get counted out unknowingly, I staggered up, and Hakon come
lashing in. I throwed my arms around him in a grizzly hug, and it
took him and the referee both to break my hold.</p>

<p>Hakon drove me staggering into the ropes with a wild-man attack,
but I'm always dangerous on the ropes, as many a good man has found
out on coming to in his dressing room. As I felt the rough strands
against my back, I caught him with a slung-shot right uppercut
which snapped his head right back betwixt his shoulders, and this
time it was him which fell into a clinch and hung on.</p>

<p>Looking over his shoulder at that sea of bristling blond heads
and yelling faces, I seen various familiar figgers. On one side of
the ring&mdash;near my corner&mdash;the Old Man was dancing around
like he was on a red-hot hatch, shedding maudlin tears and pulling
his whiskers; and, on the other side, a skinny, shifty-eyed old
seaman was whooping with glee and waving a folded paper. Cap'n Gid
Jessup, the old cuss! He knowed the Old Man would bet anything when
he was drunk&mdash;even bet the <i>Sea Girl,</i> as sweet a ship as
ever rounded the Horn, against that rotten old hulk of a <i>Nigger
King,</i> which wasn't worth a cent a ton. And, near at hand, the
referee, Yarssen, was whispering tenderly in my ear, as he broke
our clinch, "Better let Hakon knock you stiff&mdash;then you won't
feel so much what the crowd does to you when I tell them who you
are!"</p>

<p>Back on my stool again, I put my face on Mike's neck and refused
to listen either to the pleas of the Old Man or to the profane
shrieks of Bill O'Brien. By golly, that fight was like a nightmare!
I almost hoped Hakon would knock my brains out and end all my
troubles.</p>

<p>I went out for the fifth like a man going to his own hanging.
Hakon was evidently puzzled. Who wouldn't of been? Here was a
fighter&mdash;me&mdash;who was performing in spurts, exploding in
bursts of ferocious battling just when he appeared nearly out, and
sagging half heartedly when he looked like a winner.</p>

<p>He come in, lashed a vicious left to my mid-section, and dashed
me to the canvas with a thundering overhand right. Maddened, I
arose and dropped him with a wild round-house swing he wasn't
expecting. Again the crowd surged to its feet, and the referee got
flustered and started counting over Hakon in what sounded like
Swedish.</p>

<p>Hakon bounded up and slugged me into the ropes, offa which I
floundered, only to slip in a smear of my own blood on the canvas,
and again, to the disgust of the Swedes, I found myself among the
resin.</p>

<p>I looked about, heard the Old Man yelling for me to stay down,
and saw Old Cap'n Jessup waving his blame-fool contrack. I arose,
only half aware of what I was doing, and <i>bang!</i> Hakon caught
me on the ear with a hurricane swing, and I sprawled on the floor,
half under the ropes.</p>

<p>Goggling dizzily at the crowd from this position, I found myself
staring into the distended eyes of Cap'n Gid Jessup, which was
standing up, almost touching the ring. Evidently froze at the
thought of losing his bet&mdash;with me on the canvas&mdash;he was
standing there gaping, his arm still lifted with the contrack which
he'd been waving at the Old Man.</p>

<p>With me, thinking is acting. One swoop of my gloved paw swept
that contrack outa his hand. He yawped with suprise and come
lunging half through the ropes. I rolled away from him, sticking
the contrack in my mouth and chawing as fast as I could. Cap'n
Jessup grabbed me by the hair with one hand and tried to jerk the
contrack outa my jaws with the other'n, but all he got was a
severely bit finger.</p>

<p>At this, he let go of me and begun to scream and yell. "Gimme
back that paper, you cannibal! He's eatin' my contrack! I'll sue
you&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the dumbfounded referee, overcome with amazement, had
stopped counting, and the crowd, not understanding this by-play,
was roaring with astonishment. Jessup begun to crawl through the
ropes, and Yarssen yelled something and shoved him back with his
foot. He started through again, yelling blue murder, and a big
Swede, evidently thinking he was trying to attack me, swung once
with a fist the size of a caulking mallet, and Cap'n Jessup bit the
dust.</p>

<p>I arose with my mouth full of paper, and Hakon promptly banged
me on the chin with a right he started from his heels. Ow, Jerusha!
Wait'll somebody hits you on the jaw when you're chawing something!
I thought for a second every tooth in my head was shattered, along
with my jaw-bone. But I reeled groggily back into the ropes and
begun to swaller hurriedly.</p>

<p><i>Bang!</i> Hakon whanged me on the ear. "Gulp!" I said.
<i>Wham!</i> He socked me in the eye. "Gullup!" I said.
<i>Blop!</i> He pasted me in the stummick. "Oof&mdash;glup!" I
said. <i>Whang!</i> He took me on the side of the head.
"<i>Gulp!</i>" I swallered the last of the contrack, and went for
that Dane with fire in my eyes.</p>

<p>I banged Hakon with a left that sunk outa sight in his belly,
and nearly tore his head off with a paralyzing right before he
realized that, instead of being ready for the cleaners, I was
stronger'n ever and ra'ring for action.</p>

<p>Nothing loath, he rallied, and we went into a whirlwind of hooks
and swings till the world spun like a merry-go-round. Neither of us
heered the gong, and our seconds had to drag us apart and lead us
to our corners.</p>

<p>"Steve," the Old Man was jerking at my leg and weeping with
gratitude, "I seen it all! That old pole-cat's got no hold on me
now. He can't prove I ever made that fool bet. You're a scholar and
a gent&mdash;one of nature's own noblemen! You've saved the <i>Sea
Girl</i>!"</p>

<p>"Let that be a lesson to you," I said, spitting out a fragment
of the contrack along with a mouthful of blood. "Gamblin' is
sinful. Bill, I got a watch in my pants pocket. Get it and bet it
that I lay this squarehead within three more rounds."</p>

<p>And I come out for the sixth like a typhoon. "I'm going to get
mobbed by the fans as soon as the fight's over and Yarssen spills
the beans," I thought, "but I'll have my fun now."</p>

<p>For once I'd met a man which was willing and able to stand up
and slug it out with me. Hakon was as lithe as a panther and as
tough as spring-steel. He was quicker'n me, and hit nearly as hard.
We crashed together in the center of the ring, throwing all we had
into the storm of battle.</p>

<p>Through a red mist I seen Hakon's eyes blazing with a unearthly
light. He was plumb berserk, like them old Vikings which was his
ancestors. And all the Irish fighting madness took hold of me, and
we ripped and tore like tigers.</p>

<p>We was the center of a frenzied whirlwind of gloves, ripping
smashes to each other's bodies which you could hear all over the
house, and socks to each other's heads that spattered blood all
over the ring. Every blow packed dynamite and had the killer's lust
behind it. It was a test of endurance.</p>

<p>At the gong, we had to be tore apart and dragged to our corners
by force, and, at the beginning of the next round, we started in
where we'd left off. We reeled in a blinding hurricane of gloves.
We slipped in smears of blood, or was knocked to the canvas by each
other's thundering blows.</p>

<p>The crowd was limp and idiotic, drooling wordless screeches. And
the referee was bewildered and muddled. He counted over us in
Swedish, Danish and Norwegian alike. Then I was on the canvas, and
Hakon was staggering on the ropes, gasping, and the befuddled
Yarssen was counting over me. And, in the dizzy maze, I recognized
the langwidge. He was counting in Spanish!</p>

<p>"You ain't no Norwegian!" I said, glaring groggily up at
him.</p>

<p>"Four!" he said, shifting into English. "&mdash;As much as
you're a Swede! Five! A man's got to eat. Six! They wouldn't have
given me this job&mdash;seven!&mdash;if I hadn't pretended to be a
Norwegian. Eight! I'm John Jones, a vaudeville linguist from
Frisco. Nine! Keep my secret and I'll keep yours."</p>

<p>THE GONG! OUR handlers dragged us off to our corners and worked
over us. I looked over at Hakon. I was marked plenty&mdash;a split
ear, smashed lips, both eyes half closed, nose broken&mdash;but
them's my usual adornments. Hakon wasn't marked up so much in the
face&mdash;outside of a closed eye and a few gashes&mdash;but his
body was raw beef from my continuous body hammering. I drawed a
deep breath and grinned gargoylishly. With the Old Man and that
fake referee offa my mind, I couldst give all my thoughts to the
battle.</p>

<p>The gong banged again, and I charged like a enraged bull. Hakon
met me as usual, and rocked me with thundering lefts and rights.
But I bored in, driving him steadily before me with ripping,
bone-shattering hooks to the body and head. I felt him slowing up.
The man don't live which can slug with me!</p>

<p>Like a tiger scenting the kill, I redoubled the fury of my
onslaught, and the crowd arose, roaring, as they foresaw the end.
Nearly on the ropes, Hakon rallied with a dying burst of ferocity,
and momentarily had me reeling under a fusillade of desperate
swings. But I shook my head doggedly and plowed in under his
barrage, ripping my terrible right under his heart again and again,
and tearing at his head with mallet-like left hooks.</p>

<p>Flesh and blood couldn't stand it. Hakon crumpled in a neutral
corner under a blasting fire of left and right hooks. He tried to
get his legs under him, but a child couldst see he was done.</p>

<p>The referee hesitated, then raised my right glove, and the
Swedes and Norwegians came roaring into the ring and swept me offa
my feet. A glance showed Hakon's Danes carrying him to his corner,
and I tried to get to him to shake his hand, and tell him he was as
brave and fine a fighter as I ever met&mdash;which was the truth
and nothing else&mdash;but my delirious followers hadst boosted
both me and Mike on their shoulders and were carrying us toward the
dressing-room like a king or something.</p>

<p>A tall form come surging through the crowd, and Mushy Hansen
grabbed my gloved hand and yelled, "Boy, you done us proud! I'm
sorry the Danes had to lose, but, after a battle like that, I can't
hold no grudge. I couldn't stay away from the scrap. Hooray for the
old <i>Sea Girl,</i> the fightin'est ship on the seven seas!"</p>

<p>And the Swedish captain, which had acted as announcer, barged in
front of me and yelled in English, "You may be a Swede, but if you
are, you're the most unusual looking Swede I ever saw. But I don't
give a whoop! I've just seen the greatest battle since Gustavus
Adolphus licked the Dutch! Skoal, Lars lvarson!"</p>

<p>And all the Swedes and Norwegians thundered, <i>"Skoal, Lars
lverson!"</i></p>

<p>"They want you to make a speech," said Mushy.</p>

<p>"All right," I said. "Dis bane happiest moment of my life!"</p>

<p>"Louder," said Mushy. "They're makin' so much noise they can't
understand you, anyhow. Say somethin' in a foreign langwidge."</p>

<p>"All right," I said, and yelled the only foreign words I couldst
think of, <i>"Parleyvoo Francais! Vive le Stockholm! Erin go
bragh!"</i></p>

<p>And they bellered louder'n ever. A fighting man is a fighting
man in any langwidge!</p>
