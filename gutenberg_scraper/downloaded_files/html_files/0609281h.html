<h1>THE HAIR</h1>

<h3>by</h3>

<h2>A. J. Alan</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>I'm going to give you an account of certain occurrences. I
shan't attempt to explain them because they're quite beyond me.
When you've heard all the facts, some of you may be able to offer
suggestions. You must forgive me for going into a certain amount
of detail. When you don't understand what you're talking about
it's so difficult to know what to leave out.</p>

<p>This business began in the dark ages, before there was any
broadcasting. In fact, in 1921.</p>

<p>I'd been staying the week-end with a friend of mine who lives
about fifteen miles out of Bristol.</p>

<p>There was another man stopping there, too, who lived at
Dawlish. Well, on the Monday morning our host drove us into
Bristol in time for the Dawlish man to catch his train, which
left a good deal earlier than the London one. Of course, if old
Einstein had done his job properly, we could both have gone by
the same train. As it was, I had over half an hour to wait.
Talking of Einstein, wouldn't it be almost worth while dying
young so as to hear what Euclid says to him when they
meet&mdash;wherever it is?</p>

<p>There was a funny little old sort of curiosity shop in one of
the streets I went down, and I stopped to look in the window.
Right at the back, on a shelf, was a round brass box, not unlike
a powder-box in shape, and it rather took my fancy. I don't know
why&mdash;perhaps it was because I'd never seen anything quite
like it before. That must be why some women buy some hats.</p>

<p>Anyway, the shop window was so dirty that you could hardly see
through it, so I went inside to have a closer look. An incredibly
old man came out of the back regions and told me all he knew
about the box, which wasn't very much. It was fairly heavy, made
of brass, round, four inches high, and about three inches in
diameter. There was something inside it, which we could hear when
we shook it, but no one had ever been able to get the lid off.
He'd bought it from a sailor some years before, but couldn't say
in the least what part of the world it came from.</p>

<p>"What about fifteen bob?"</p>

<p>I offered him ten, and he took it very quickly, and then I had
to sprint back to the station to catch my train. When I got home
I took the box up into my workshop and had a proper look at it.
It was extremely primitive as regards work, and had evidently
been made by hand, and not on a lathe. Also, there had been
something engraved on the lid, but it had been taken off with a
file. Next job was to get the lid off without doing any damage to
it. It was a good deal more than hand tight, and no ordinary
methods were any good. I stood it lid downwards for a week in a
dish of glycerine as a start, and then made two brass collars,
one for the box and one for the lid. At the-end of the week I
bolted the collars on, fixed the box in the vice and tried
tapping the lid round with a hammer&mdash;but it wouldn't start.
Then, I tried it the other way and it went at once. That
explained why no one had ever been able to unscrew it&mdash;it
had a left-handed thread on it. Rather a dirty
trick&mdash;especially to go and do it all those years
before.</p>

<p>Well, here it was, unscrewing very sweetly, and I began to
feel quite like Howard Carter, wondering what I was going to
find. It might go off bang, or jump out and hit me in the face.
However, nothing exciting happened when the lid came off. In
fact, the box only seemed to be half-full of dust, but at the
bottom was a curled-up plait of hair. When straightened out, it
was about nine inches long and nearly as thick as a pencil. I
unplaited a short length, and found it consisted of some hundreds
of very fine hairs, but in such a filthy state (I shoved them
under the microscope) that there was nothing much to be seen. So
I thought I'd clean them. You may as well know the
process&mdash;first of all a bath of dilute hydrochloric acid to
get the grease off, then a solution of washing soda to remove the
acid. Then a washing in distilled water, then a bath of alcohol
to get rid of any traces of water, and a final rinsing in ether
to top off with.</p>

<p>Just as I took it out of the ether they called me down to the
telephone, so I shoved it down on the first clean thing which
came handy, namely, a piece of white cardboard, and went
downstairs. When I examined the plait later on, the only thing of
interest that came to light was the fact that the hairs had all
apparently belonged to several different women. The colours
ranged from jet-black, through brown, red, and gold, right up to
pure white. None of the hair was dyed, which proved how very old
it was. I showed it to one or two people, but they didn't seem
very enthusiastic, so I put it, and its box, in a little corner
cupboard we have, and forgot all about it.</p>

<p>Then the first strange coincidence happened.</p>

<p>About ten days later a pal of mine called Matthews came into
the club with a bandage across his forehead. People naturally
asked him what was the matter, and he said he didn't know, and
what's more the doctor didn't know. He'd suddenly flopped down on
his drawing-room floor, in the middle of tea, and lain like a
log. His wife was in a fearful stew, of course, and telephoned
for the doctor. However, Matthews came round at the end of about
five minutes, and sat up and asked what had hit him. When the
doctor blew in a few minutes later he was pretty well all right
again except for a good deal of pain in his forehead. The doctor
couldn't find anything the matter except a red mark which was
beginning to show on the skin just where the pain was.</p>

<p>Well, this mark got clearer and clearer, until it looked just
like a blow from a stick. Next day it was about the same, except
that a big bruise had come up all round the mark. After that it
got gradually better. Matthews took the bandage off and showed it
me at the club, and there was nothing much more than a bruise
with a curved red line down the middle of it, like the track of a
red-hot worm.</p>

<p>They'd decided that he'd had an attack of giddiness and must
somehow have bumped his head in falling. And that was that.</p>

<p>About a month later, my wife said to me: "We really must tidy
your workshop!" And I said: "Must we?" And she said: "Yes, it's a
disgrace." So up we went.</p>

<p>Tidying my workshop consists of putting the tools back in
their racks, and of my wife wanting to throw away things she
finds on the floor, and me saying: "Oh, no, I could use that for
so and so."</p>

<p>The first thing we came across was the piece of white
cardboard I'd used to put the plait of hair on while I'd run to
the telephone that day.</p>

<p>When we came to look at the other side we found it was a
flashlight photograph of a dinner I'd been at. You know what
happens. Just before the speeches a lot of blighters come in with
a camera and some poles with tin trays on the top, and someone
says: "Will the chairman please stand?" and he's helped to his
feet. Then there's a blinding flash and the room's full of smoke,
and the blighters go out again. Later on a man comes round with
proofs, and if you are very weak&mdash;or near the
chairman&mdash;you order one print.</p>

<p>Well, this dinner had been the worshipful company of
skate-fasteners or something, and I'd gone as the guest of the
same bloke Matthews I've already been telling you about, and we'd
sat "side by each," as the saying is. My wife was looking at the
photograph, and she said: "What's that mark on Mr. Matthews's
forehead?" And I looked&mdash;and there, sure enough, was the
exact mark that he'd come into the club with a month before. The
curious part being, of course, that the photograph had been taken
at least six months before he'd had the funny attack which caused
the mark. Now, then&mdash;on the back of the photograph, when we
examined it, was a faint brown line. This was evidently left by
the plait of hair when I'd pinned it out to dry, and it had
soaked through and caused the mark on Matthews's face. I checked
it by shoving a needle right through the cardboard. Of course,
this looked like a very strange coincidence, on the face of it. I
don't know what your experience of coincidences is&mdash;but mine
is that they usually aren't. Anyway, I took the trouble to trace
out the times, and I finally established, beyond a shadow of a
doubt, that I had pinned the hair out on the photograph between
four and a quarter-past on a particular day, and that Matthews
had had his funny attack on the same day at about a quarter-past
four. That was something <i>like</i> a coincidence. Next, the
idea came to me to try it again. Not on poor old Matthews,
obviously&mdash;he'd already had some&mdash;and, besides, he was
a friend of mine. I know perfectly well that we are told to be
kind to our enemies, and so on&mdash;in fact, I do quite a lot of
that&mdash;but when it comes to trying an experiment of this
kind&mdash;even if the chances are a million to one against it
being a success, I mean having any result&mdash;one naturally
chooses an enemy rather than a friend. I looked round for a
suitable&mdash;victim&mdash;someone who wouldn't be missed much
in case there happened to be another coincidence. The individual
on whom my choice fell was the nurse next door.</p>

<p>We can see into their garden from our bathroom
window&mdash;and we'd often noticed the rotten way she treated
the child she had charge of when she thought no one was looking.
Nothing one could definitely complain about&mdash;you know what a
thankless job it is to butt into your neighbour's
affairs&mdash;but she was systematically unkind, and we hated the
sight of her. Another thing&mdash;when she first came she used to
lean over the garden wall and sneak our roses&mdash;at least, she
didn't even do that&mdash;she used to pull them off their stalks
and let them drop&mdash;I soon stopped that. I fitted up some
little arrangements of fish-hooks round some of the most
accessible roses and anchored them to the ground with wires.
There was Hell-and-Tommy the next morning, and she had her hand
done up in bandages for a week.</p>

<p>Altogether she was just the person for my experiment. The
first thing was to get a photograph of her, so the next sunny
morning, when she was in the garden, I made a noise like an
aeroplane out of the bathroom window to make her look up, and got
her nicely. As soon as the first print was dry, about eleven
o'clock the same night, I fastened the plait of hair across the
forehead with two pins&mdash;feeling extremely foolish, as one
would, of course, doing an idiotic thing like that&mdash;and put
it away in a drawer in my workshop. The evening of the next day,
when I got home, my wife met me and said: "What do you
think&mdash;the nurse next door was found dead in bed this
morning." And she went on to say that the people were quite upset
about it, and there was going to be an inquest, and all the rest
of it. I tell you, you could have knocked me down with a brick. I
said: "No, not really; what did she die of?" You must understand
that my lady wife didn't know anything about the experiment.
She'd never have let me try it. She's rather
superstitious&mdash;in spite of living with me. As soon as I
could I sneaked up to the workshop drawer and got out the
photograph, and&mdash;I know you won't believe me, but it doesn't
make any difference&mdash;when I unpinned the plait of hair and
took it off there was a clearly-marked brown stain right across
the nurse's forehead. I tell you, that <i>did</i> make me sit up,
if you like&mdash;because that made twice&mdash;first Matthews
and now&mdash;now.</p>

<p>It was rather disturbing, and I know it sounds silly, but I
couldn't help feeling to blame in some vague way.</p>

<p>Well, the next thing was the inquest&mdash;I attended that,
naturally, to know what the poor unfortunate woman had died of.
Of course, they brought it in as "death from natural causes,"
namely, several burst bloodvessels in the brain; but what puzzled
the doctors was what had caused the "natural causes"&mdash;also,
she had the same sort of mark on her forehead as Matthews had
had. They had gone very thoroughly into the theory that she might
have been exposed to X-rays&mdash;it <i>did</i> look a bit like
that&mdash;but it was more or less proved that she couldn't have
been, so they frankly gave it up. Of course, it was all very
interesting and entertaining, and I quite enjoyed it, as far as
one can enjoy an inquest, but they hadn't cleared up the vexed
question&mdash;did she fall or was she pu&mdash;well, had she
snuffed it on account of the plait of hair, or had she not?
Obviously the matter couldn't be allowed to rest there&mdash;it
was much too thrilling. So I looked about for someone else to try
it on and decided that a man who lived in the house opposite
would do beautifully. He wasn't as bad as the nurse because he
wasn't cruel&mdash;at least, not intentionally&mdash;he played
the fiddle&mdash;so I decided not to kill him more than I could
help.</p>

<p>The photograph was rather a bother, because he didn't go out
much. You've no idea how difficult it is to get a decent
full-face photograph of a man who knows you by sight without him
knowing. However, I managed to get one after a fortnight or so.
It was rather small and I had to enlarge it, but it wasn't bad
considering. He used to spend most of his evenings up in a top
room practising, double stopping and what-not&mdash;so after
dinner I went up to my workshop window, which overlooks his, and
waited for him to begin. Then, when he'd really warmed up to his
job, I just touched the plait across the photograph&mdash;not
hard, but&mdash;well, like you do when you are testing a bit of
twin flex to find out which wire is which, you touch the ends
across an accumulator or an H.T. battery. Quite indefensible in
theory, but invariably done in practice. (Personally, I always
use the electric light mains&mdash;the required information is so
instantly forthcoming.) Well, that's how I touched the photograph
with the plait. The first time I did it my bloke played a wrong
note. That was nothing, of course, so I did it again more slowly.
This time there was no doubt about it. He hastily put down his
fiddle and hung out of the window, gasping like a fish for about
five minutes. I tell you, I was so surprised that I felt like
doing the same.</p>

<p>However, I pulled myself together, and wondered whether one
ought to burn the da&mdash;er&mdash;plait or not. But there
seemed too many possibilities in it for that&mdash;so I decided
to learn how to use it instead. It would take too long to tell
you all about my experiments. They lasted for several months, and
I reduced the thing to such an exact science that I could do
anything from giving a gnat a headache to killing a man. All
this, mind you, at the cost of one man, one woman, lots of
wood-lice, and a conscientious objector. You must admit that
that's pretty moderate, considering what fun one <i>could</i>
have had with a discovery of that kind.</p>

<p>Well, it seemed to me that, now the control of my absent
treatment had been brought to such a degree of accuracy, it would
be rather a pity not to employ it in some practical way. In other
words, to make a fortune quickly without undue loss of life.</p>

<p>One could, of course, work steadily through the people one
disliked, but it wouldn't bring in anything for some time.</p>

<p>I mean, even if you insure them first you've got to wait a
year before they die, or the company won't pay, and in any case
it begins to look fishy after you've done it a few times. Then I
had my great idea: Why shouldn't my process be applied to
horse-racing? All one had to do was to pick some outsider in a
race&mdash;back it for all you were worth at about 100 to 1, and
then see that it didn't get beaten.</p>

<p>The actual operation would be quite simple. One would only
have to have a piece of card-board with photographs of all the
runners stuck on it&mdash;except the one that was to win, of
course&mdash;and then take up a position giving a good view of
the race.</p>

<p>I wasn't proposing to hurt any of the horses in the least.
They were only going to get the lightest of touches, just enough
to give them a tired feeling, soon after the start. Then, if my
horse didn't seem to have the race well in hand near the finish,
I could give one more light treatment to any horse which still
looked dangerous.</p>

<p>It stood to reason that great care would have to be taken not
to upset the tunning too much. For instance, if all the horses
except one fell down, or even stopped and began to graze, there
would be a chance of the race being declared void.</p>

<p>So I had two or three rehearsals. They worked perfectly. The
last one hardly was a rehearsal because I had a tenner on at 33
to 1, just for luck&mdash;and, of course, it came off.</p>

<p>However, it wasn't as lucky as it sounds. Just outside the
entrance to the grandstand there was rather a squash and, as I
came away I got surrounded by four or five men who seemed to be
pushing me about a bit, but it didn't strike me what the game was
until one of them got his hand into the breast-pocket of my
coat.</p>

<p>Then I naturally made a grab at him and got him just above the
elbow with both hands, and drove his hand still further into my
pocket. That naturally pushed the pocket, with his hand inside
it, under my right arm, and I squeezed it against my ribs for all
I was worth.</p>

<p>Now, there was nothing in that pocket but the test tube with
the plait of hair in it, and the moment I started squeezing it
went with a crunch. I'm a bit hazy about the next minute because
my light-fingered friend tried to get free, and two of his pals
helped him by bashing me over the head. They were quite rough. In
fact, they entered so heartily into the spirit of the thing that
they went on doing it until the police came up and collared
them.</p>

<p>You should have seen that hand when it did come out of my
pocket. Cut to pieces, and bits of broken glass sticking out all
over it&mdash;like a crimson tipsy cake. He was so bad that we
made a call at a doctor's on the way to the police station for
him to have a small artery tied up. There was a cut on the back
of my head that wanted a bit of attention, too. Quite a nice
chap, the doctor, but he was my undoing. He was, without doubt,
the baldest doctor I've ever seen, though I once saw a balder
alderman.</p>

<p>When he'd painted me with iodine, I retrieved the rest of the
broken glass and the hair from the bottom of my pocket and asked
him if he could give me an empty bottle to put it in. He said:
"Certainly," and produced one, and we corked the hair up in it.
When I got home, eventually, I looked in the bottle, but apart
from a little muddy substance at the bottom it was
empty&mdash;the plait of hair had melted away. Then I looked at
the label on the bottle, and found the name of a much-advertised
hair restorer.</p>
