<h2>THE IVORY GOD</h2>

<h4>by</h4>

<h3>J.S. Fletcher</h3>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>At six o'clock Thurston put down his pen, pushed his chair
back from the table at which he had been writing, and rose to his
feet with a series of gestures indicative of mental and physical
fatigue. He glanced at the few sheets of manuscript which
represented the result of a long day's labour, and he frowned, as
if in anger or distaste.</p>

<p>He had written, or tried to write, from ten o'clock until one,
and again from two until six; and his entire product after seven
hours' work was comparatively infinitesimal. He had felt no
enthusiasm; he had been unable to concentrate his thoughts; the
whole thing had been distasteful to him. As he glanced around him
he asked himself for the thousandth time whether the game was
worth the candle.</p>

<p>More from force of habit than from genuine desire to do it,
Thurston proceeded to make some sort of toilet for the evening.
He shaved and washed carefully; he put on a clean linen shirt and
a dark lounge suit; he was unduly particular about the fold of
his tie; in several small ways he showed that he had a
gentlemanlike love of cleanliness and orderly habits.</p>

<p>He did everything very slowly. It would have been evident to
anyone who might have had an opportunity of watching him that he
had no engagement to keep. In point of fact, he had few friends
with whom he could have kept any engagement. He was, as he now
never cared to remind himself, one of the very loneliest men
living. For a while he had reminded himself of this pertinent
truth somewhat often; then he wearied of the thought, and put it
from him. The fact of the loneliness, however, remained.</p>

<p>Thurston lived in two rooms at the top of a house which stood
in a quiet street near the British Museum&mdash;a street of an
aspect so grey and pathetic that you wondered at first sight of
it whether laughter or children's voices were ever heard there.
The two rooms opened one into the other by means of a folding
door. Thurston had furnished them himself when he first came to
town.</p>

<p>One room contained a camp bedstead, a chest of drawers, a
dressing-table, a wash-stand, a bath, and a hard-bottomed chair.
The floor was stained and polished, and destitute of carpet; but
there was a thick bearskin rug at the bedside. It was absolutely
destitute of luxuries or of pictures, but it possessed a
first-rate reading-lamp, attached to the wall at the head of the
bed.</p>

<p>The other room knew the luxury of books; its walls were
covered with them to half their height. The books related chiefly
to philosophy, theology, history, metaphysics. There was little
that was light, but a table was strewn with the reviews of
several countries, all purchased second-hand and when a month
old.</p>

<p>A desk, littered with papers, stood in the window; an
arm-chair was placed near the hearth; two other chairs of an
easyish sort occurred, sometimes here, sometimes there; a small
table, big enough for one person to eat at, was in the middle of
the room, which, unlike the sleeping-chamber, was softly carpeted
and luxuriant in thick rugs.</p>

<p>It also possessed some luxuries in the way of pictures; but
these, to the English eye of ordinary knowledge, were of a
strange taste, being Japanese. One skilled in such matters might
have told you that they were all by the most celebrated Japanese
artists. Even then you would have felt some uneasiness at the
prospect of being continually shut up in a room whose decorations
were so purely Eastern.</p>

<p>In these two rooms Thurston had spent five years, every day
corresponding to another day. He prepared his own breakfast when
he wished for it; he read or wrote when he desired to do so; he
lunched and dined out; he spent his evenings reading or thinking
or dreaming. It was a strange life altogether; but it was his.
But, then, the few people who knew Thurston said he was a strange
man, a man who spoke little, laughed never, smiled seldom, and
who was quite young, in spite of everything. In point of fact, he
was twenty-seven years old.</p>

<p>At twenty-two he had left Oxford with some reputation as a
scholar and a mystic, and had come to town with the set purpose
of following a literary career. Whether he had any ambitions at
that time is a debatable question. It is quite certain that at
twenty-seven none of them had been carried out. He had a little
money of his own&mdash;sufficient to pay his rent, his
housekeeping expenses, his tailor's bills and so on; and there
was, therefore, no need to keep his nose to the grindstone.</p>

<p>But he had made no name. He sometimes exhibited a rather
heavy, rather pedantic, rather wearisome sort of article to one
or other of the leading reviews&mdash;the sort of article which
is spoken of with great respect by the critics, and read by only
a few experts&mdash;but to the general public he was as unknown
as an unborn babe.</p>

<p>The people who had any dealings with him said that he was
unsociable; he had no conversation. If by any chance he was
induced to lunch or dine with you, his sole notion seemed to be
to get away as quickly as possible. It was evident that he was
one of those men who like to be alone.</p>

<p>There were times, however, when Thurston felt his loneliness;
and one of them was hanging heavily about him on this particular
evening. He had found it difficult to write during the day; and
more than once he had caught himself wishing that a friend would
come in to break the solitude. But he would have been hard put to
it to say where such a friend was to be found.</p>

<p>He never encouraged anyone to visit him at his rooms. One or
two men&mdash;old college acquaintances&mdash;had tracked him
down and called upon him, but quickly discovered that they were
not wanted. It was not that Thurston wished to be rude; it was
simply that a certain shyness and loneliness ran in his blood and
his temperament, and made him incapable of entertaining his
fellow-creatures. He was essentially an anchorite; and yet there
were times when his flesh called for something which it would
have found it hard to define in words.</p>

<p>As Thurston drew on his overcoat a light tap came at his door,
and he went across and opened it, not without some feeling of
surprise that anyone should be there. In the faint light at the
top of the landing he saw a man whom he did not recognise&mdash;a
tall, sloping-shouldered man, whose back was somewhat bowed,
whose knees bent in&mdash;a man who made a succession of angles
in his clothes. Thurston could see that he was shabbily attired,
that his hair was long, greasy, and unclean; he had a vague
notion that an unwashed atmosphere hung heavily all round and
about his visitor. He held the door half open, staring at the
man; the man blinked at him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thurston?" he said inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Well?" replied Thurston.</p>

<p>The man sighed heavily.</p>

<p>"I was sent to you, sir, by Mr. Evanson. I have something to
show you which he thought you would like to see. He thought you
might not be indisposed to buy it from me. May I come in and show
it to you, Mr. Thurston?" said the man, indicating a small parcel
which he carried in the crook of one arm.</p>

<p>"I am not disposed to buy anything," answered Thurston,
keeping his place.</p>

<p>"But this, sir, is something very uncommon. It is seldom that
any collector has such a chance of securing such a valuable
curiosity," urged the visitor. "At any rate it will do you no
harm to look at it, Mr. Thurston."</p>

<p>"Well," said Thurston, impassively and hesitatingly, "you may
bring it in, then, but I really don't want to see it, and I
shan't buy it, whatever it may be."</p>

<p>He turned away, and made preparations for lighting a lamp. The
man with the parcel lingered at the threshold until the lamp had
been placed on the centre table, and the apartment was bathed in
a clear, powerful light.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said Thurston, still impassive as ever, "come
forward, and let me see what it is! Mr. Evanson has no business
to send you to me. I'm merely an acquaintance of his, and I'm
certainly not a collector. What is it you have to show me?"</p>

<p>The untidy and unwashed person took small notice of this
impatient outburst. He advanced to the table, placed his parcel
near the lamp, and proceeded to divest it of its wrappings. He
kept himself between Thurston and the parcel while this was going
on, and he did not speak until he suddenly turned round, and
said, with a note of pride and triumph in his voice:</p>

<p>"There, Mr. Thurston, look at that!"</p>

<p>Thurston, during the unfolding of the parcel, had fallen into
a sort of day-dream. He came out of it with a start, and looked
at the object which his visitor had placed on the table in the
full light of the lamp. A sudden gleam came into his rather dull
eyes; a sudden exclamation burst from his lips.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said.</p>

<p>The man smiled, and rubbed his hands. He chuckled.</p>

<p>"I thought that would move you, Mr. Thurston!" he said. "It's
a beauty, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Thurston made no answer to this. He advanced to the table and
stood at its edge, contemplating the thing which his visitor had
been so anxious to exhibit. He found himself staring at an ivory
statue of the god Ganesha, and wondering at the exquisite beauty
of the workmanship, the subtle tints of the ivory, the atmosphere
of the mystic East, which its mere dumb presence suggested and
conveyed.</p>

<p>It was not a thing of any great size&mdash;its height was some
ten inches, its breadth six; a cigar-box would have held it. And
to Thurston, steeped to the lips in the odour and colour of the
Orient, it represented a world of art and of dreams. He stared at
the god; the god stared at him out of a pair of amethyst eyes,
cunningly set into the creamy white of the ivory. A strange
intoxication stole into Thurston's soul. He heard himself
presently talking in set fashion, calmly, methodically, as though
he were in a shop, buying something. He heard his visitor's
replies.</p>

<p>"You want to sell this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I want to sell it. I'll tell you how I came by it,
too, Mr. Thurston. All's above-board; and Mr. Evanson, he knows
me well, and knew me before I fell on hard times. It was this
way, sir: My father was in the army at the time of the Mutiny,
and he saw a good deal of fighting out in India&mdash;Delhi and
Lucknow and elsewhere&mdash;and he brought home a good many
curiosities, and that image amongst them. It's the image of some
Hindu god, so I'm told, and, of course, anybody can see that the
workmanship is excellent. My father gave it to me on his
deathbed, and charged me never to part with it, because there's
some legend about its bringing luck with it. But it's brought no
luck to me," continued Thurston's visitor, with a dismal laugh.
"I've been down on my luck for some time. However, it will bring
luck if you're agreeable to buy it, sir. Perhaps that's where the
luck comes in."</p>

<p>"What price do you set upon it?" asked Thurston
mechanically.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I, of course, don't know anything about these
matters. I was recommended to take the carving to Mr. Evanson,"
said the man, "and he advised me to see you. I should be quite
satisfied to take what he said he thought it was worth."</p>

<p>"What was that?" said Thurston.</p>

<p>"Twenty pounds, sir."</p>

<p>The man uttered these words with some anxiety, and his eyes
fastened themselves on Thurston's face, as if to watch the
effect. Thurston, however, was still fascinated by the ivory god,
and neither eyes nor lips betrayed anything. He remained silent
for some moments. At last he started, as from a reverie.</p>

<p>"I am quite prepared to accept Mr. Evanson's estimate of the
carving's value," he said. "I will give you twenty pounds for
it."</p>

<p>The man bowed his untidy head, and sighed deeply. It was
evident that the prospect of immediate possession of twenty
pounds was very grateful to him.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," he said.</p>

<p>Thurston went over to his desk, unlocked a drawer, and
produced a cashbox, which, on examination, proved to contain
twenty-two pound notes and gold. He counted out twenty to his
visitor, put two pounds in his own pocket, restored the depleted
cashbox to its drawer and locked it up again, and then, asking
the vendor his name and address, wrote out a formal receipt. Five
minutes later the unkempt person was descending the stairs, happy
in the possession of a small fortune, and Thurston was left alone
with the ivory god.</p>

<p>The clanging of the street door, far below, plunged the house
into a weird silence. In its midst Thurston sighed deeply. There
was a strange feeling within him that he had suddenly come into
possession of something which he had been wanting all his life.
It was akin to the feeling of the lover to whom the much-desired
object of affection is at last given.</p>

<p>When the stranger first unwrapped the ivory god and revealed
its strange charms to his eyes, Thurston became aware of a sense
of satisfaction. This sense was now increasing to a point of
something like delight. He drew in his nether lip, and began to
utter a soft, sibilant sound, not unlike the purring of a cat.
Not for many years had he experienced such a keen feeling of
pleasure as that which now filled him.</p>

<p>He began looking about him for a suitable place wherein to
enshrine his new acquisition. He glanced at the chimney-piece,
already ornamented profusely with carvings from China, Japan, and
India, with stones and vases from Peru, and turned away
dissatisfied. The ivory god, he said to himself, must have a
better setting than the chimney-piece offered. He wanted to have
it near him while he wrote. There was something in the lines, in
the dull white of the ivory, in the subtle purple tints of the
amethyst eyes, which bade fair to soothe and to fascinate. He
wished to have the ivory god upon his desk.</p>

<p>Looking about the room, he caught sight of a little triptych
which he had bought years ago in Venice, admiring it more for the
fineness of the wood and the carving than for the elementary art
of the figure of Christ which was placed in the centre niche. Its
dark wood, he thought, would make an admirable setting to the
pallid tint of the ivory; and without hesitation he took it down
from the wall, wrenched away the crucifix from the middle
compartment, and installed the figure of the Hindu god in its
place. Then he placed the triptych on the ledge above his desk,
and stood back from it, admiring the bizarre effect. The amethyst
eyes of the ivory god seemed to smile into his own.</p>

<p>Thurston tore himself away from his treasure at last, and went
out to dine. He walked through the gloom of the badly-lighted
London streets, until he came to the quiet restaurant wherein a
certain corner had come to be almost sacred to him. He ate and
drank mechanically and sparingly. A small quantity of plainly
cooked food satisfied him at all times; he drank no wine or
spirits or ale; after dinner he smoked a cigarette to the
accompaniment of a cup of coffee, and glanced over his evening
newspaper, handed to him by a waiter who knew him for an old and
regular customer. Altogether he spent an hour at this restaurant;
and on this particular evening there was an itching desire within
him all the time to get back to his rooms. He wanted to examine
the ivory god again, to look at it, to wonder about it. It was
with a feeling of relief and of anticipation of coming pleasure
that he finally paid his bill and went quickly away. Thurston
shut himself into his room with a great sense of satisfaction. He
was alone in the midst of five millions of people&mdash;alone
with the only things for which he cared, his books and his
curiosities. Other men might dine and wine, go to theatres,
balls, social functions. He cared for none of these things. He
knew joys which were far deeper, far better worth having, and he
could command their presence whenever he pleased to do so. So he
fastened his outer door, drew a warm curtain over the inner one,
turned up his lamp, and stirred his fire, and looked round about
him with a sense of comfort. He saw the ivory god shining in the
triptych above his desk, and caught the gleam of its amethyst
eyes; and he was once more aware of the feeling that it in some
strange way rounded off his life. He was glad to have it and to
see it there, sitting above his altar like a presiding deity.</p>

<p>Thurston's next proceedings were significant and explanatory.
He divested himself of his overcoat, and of the smartish
morning-coat beneath it, and slipped into an old velvet jacket of
undoubted antiquity; and, that done, he exchanged his boots for a
comfortable and well-worn pair of slippers. And then, having made
sure of his preliminaries, he unlocked a cupboard and produced a
small decanter of curious shape, half filled with a golden-brown
liquid, which seemed to sparkle and coruscate in the
lamplight.</p>

<p>He set it on the table in the centre of the room, placed a
glass of singular beauty&mdash;a deep crystal bowl set in twisted
columns&mdash;at its side, and proceeded to heat water in a
kettle. When the water was heated he made a careful mixture of it
and the golden-brown liquid in the glass; and after that he
curled himself up in an easy-chair facing the ivory god, with the
glass and the decanter at his side.</p>

<p>Thurston had become a slave to the opium habit. Beginning the
use of that attractive and insidious drug as a cure for some
slight complaint, he had increased his doses, until at
twenty-seven he made no excuses to himself for consuming it in
large quantities.</p>

<p>During the day he took it in the form of pills, each
containing a few grains; at night, following the example of De
Quincey, he indulged in laudanum negus, sometimes sitting up
until the grey of the morning broke in upon his dreams and
fantasies.</p>

<p>He had long since relinquished all thought of giving up the
habit. It had destroyed his moral courage once and for all, and
had taken complete possession of him, mentally and physically.
Under the influence of opium he was indifferent to everything in
the world; and it was rarely that its influence was not upon
him.</p>

<p>As the subtle charm of the drug stole through his brain,
Thurston yielded himself up to the dreams which it induced.</p>

<p>His eyes were fixed on the ivory god. He began to speculate on
its history, on the strange things which those amethyst eyes must
have seen, on the deeds of blood, the mystic panorama of Eastern
life, with its gorgeous colouring, its strange suggestion, which
they must have watched unmoved. The phantasmagoria of a hundred
worlds began to float, and finally to crystallise, before
him.</p>

<p>In his estimation the carving was hundreds upon hundreds of
years old. It must certainly have had its orginal abiding place
in temple or palace, and of itself formed some part of the
gorgeous picture which was rapidly shaping itself in Thurston's
imagination.</p>

<p>Thurston's evenings were usually spent in a dream of bliss
which was itself a source of deep mental content. He was
surprised, on this occasion, to find that contemplation of the
ivory god was leading him into a state of unusual unrest.</p>

<p>A strange desire to sit down at his desk&mdash;literally at
the feet of the god&mdash;and write, filled him with strenuous
force. It was years since he had ever written anything at night,
and the mere thought of doing so now made him almost afraid. But
the fear vanished quickly; and he was presently conscious of
nothing but that he was shortly going to sit down at his desk. It
was as if the ivory god had laid some command upon him. He turned
up the flame of his spirit-lamp, heated more water, and mixed
himself more of the drug. A little later he found himself laying
out paper on his blotting-pad, and examining the nib of a pen.
And after a time, as if it had been the most natural thing in the
world, he settled himself in his elbow-chair, and after one long,
searching look at the ivory god, he dipped his pen in the ink and
began to write:</p>

<p>"This is the Story of the Loves and Hates of Men and Women
that have long been Dust; the Story of a Day when the Red Earth
was Young, and the Gods sat steadfast in their Places; the Story
of a Time and Times; and behold it has never been told to Human
Ear till Now!"</p>

<p>After that came a long night of work&mdash;of work such as
Thurston had never before done in his life. It was ten o'clock
when he wrote the first words on the top sheet of the pile of
manuscript paper which he had laid ready to hand. As each
successive hour struck on the silver-voiced clock on the
chimney-piece it did but interrupt the gentle scribbling of a
rapidly-moving pen.</p>

<p>On Thurston's left hand stood the spirit-lamp, the kettle, the
decanter, the glass! now and then he turned to these things and
mixed the drug. On his right hand there gradually accumulated a
pile of closely-written manuscript. Above him, the amethyst eyes
grew purple in the lamplight, the ivory god stared into the gloom
beyond the writer's head.</p>

<p>The grey light stole through the cracks and crannies of the
shutters, and found Thurston still writing. Much later, the old
woman who acted as bedmaker and charwoman knocked loudly at the
outer door. Thurston shouted to her to go away and leave him
alone; and his pen travelled on and on as if it would never
stop.</p>

<p>It was about three days after this that a famous publisher,
with whom Thurston was acquainted in slight fashion, was somewhat
astonished to find the latter waiting for him in his private
room. He stared at Thurston curiously, noting with the keen eye
of a practical man of the world that his visitor wore a strange
expression, and seemed to be wrapped in an atmosphere of
mystery.</p>

<p>He was shaved and washed, and wore his best garments; but
there was a strange pallor on his face, a strange light in his
eyes, and his voice was as unnaturally steady as the cold, almost
lifeless hand which he placed within the publisher's palm.</p>

<p>The publisher, who had never been able to understand
Thurston's strangeness of manner, reverted to an earlier
suspicion, and wondered if his visitor had been drinking; but he
failed to perceive either twitch or tremor in face or hand, and
his visitor's voice was even and firm to the verge of
monotony.</p>

<p>"Some time ago," said Thurston, "you were good enough to
suggest to me that I should write a romance of Eastern life. It
seemed to you that I possessed the necessary knowledge of the
East to attempt such a book."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said the other. "I don't know any man better
fitted. You've been working in that direction all your life,
haven't you? In fact, it's been a wonder to me that you never
thought of the thing yourself."</p>

<p>Thurston produced a parcel of manuscript.</p>

<p>"I have here," he said, "a considerable portion of such a
work. There is much that I might say to you about it, but at
present I prefer not to say anything. Yes, it is not ordinary
work, and I should like some assurance from you that it shall be
read for you by some one competent to judge of its merits."</p>

<p>"I'll give it to Flintford to read," said the publisher. "How
does his name strike you? He's about the best man I can think
of."</p>

<p>"I am quite prepared to accept Mr. Flintford's judgment,"
replied Thurston. "Indeed, I intended suggesting his name to you.
Then I will leave this portion of the manuscript with you?"</p>

<p>"Do," answered the publisher. "I'll send it on to Flintford by
special messenger at once, and ask him to read it. About the rest
of the book, now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The remaining portion," said Thurston, "will be delivered to
you when it is written." And with that and a frigid shaking of
the publisher's outstretched hand he went away, walking through
the outer office, as one of the clerks said, like a ghost.</p>

<p>The next morning Flintford walked into the publisher's office,
looking very much excited.</p>

<p>"I say!" he exclaimed. "Where did you get that manuscript
which you sent me yesterday? And have you got the rest?"</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" asked the publisher, ignoring the second
part of the question. "Is it good stuff? Will it do? Would it
sell?"</p>

<p>"Good! My dear sir, it is the most wonderful piece of
imaginative work I ever read in my life. It is amazing,
stupendous&mdash;quite confusing in its brilliance. I began it
last night. I went on reading it until breakfast-time this
morning," answered Flintford. "I never read anything quite like
it. Indeed, I wouldn't have believed that we had a brain amongst
us that could have imagined such a work. Look here! You know I am
by no means an enthusiastic person. Well, this book, if it keeps
up that level all through, is the biggest find of the last
half-century. For sheer imagination the man beats Poe
hollow!"</p>

<p>"You think it will make a hit?" inquired the publisher.</p>

<p>"It is the greatest thing I ever had put before me," answered
the critic. "I cannot understand the power in it. Who is the man?
How does he come to be able to re-create Hindu life as it must
have been thousands of years ago? Where did he get such an
overwhelming imagination? There's something that's almost unholy,
unearthly, about the whole thing. It is a great book&mdash;a rare
book. I should like to see the author."</p>

<p>"I will try to get him here at three this afternoon," said the
publisher. "Come in after lunch. I may tell you that he is a
strange person&mdash;never done anything but an occasional
article in the heavy reviews, but, I fancy, cram full of the
East."</p>

<p>"That," said the critic, "is evident. I'll come at three."</p>

<p>At three o'clock Thurston was shown into the publisher's
private room, and introduced to the great critic. Thurston, if
possible, was more ghostlike than ever; more emotionless; more
insensible to any outward influence. He sat with fixed
passionless eyes, listening, while the critic praised his work
and asked questions. It was not until all this had been said that
he spoke.</p>

<p>"I think I may take you both into my confidence," he said. "I
conclude, Mr. Mayne, that you will publish this book, and
therefore I see no reason why you and Mr. Flintford should be
kept in ignorance as to its real history. I may tell you that the
story is not mine at all: it is being dictated to me. The
circumstances are peculiar; but I feel sure that Mr. Flintford,
with his knowledge of the East, will quite understand. I recently
came into possession of an image of the god Ganesha, wonderfully
wrought in ivory and adorned with amethyst eyes. The story of
which you have read some portion is being dictated to me by this
image, or, more probably, by this god represented by it. I think
you will understand," he said, turning to Flintford with an air
which had something appealing in it.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Flintford quietly, "I quite understand."</p>

<p>"I felt the influence of the god," continued Thurston, "as
soon as I saw the image. It is a strange, a very fascinating
influence. It impelled me to write against my will; and then I
found that I was but a mouthpiece. Everything has been put into
my lips&mdash;I should say, pen. Clearly, what I have written is
the story of the image."</p>

<p>"And when," asked Flintford kindly, "when do you suppose the
end of this story will be reached, Mr. Thurston?"</p>

<p>Thurston produced another packet of manuscript. He laid it on
the publisher's desk.</p>

<p>"I believe," he said, "I believe the end will come to-night.
If"&mdash;here he glanced from one face to the other&mdash;"if
you would like to see the ivory statue, and could call to-morrow
morning about noon, I will show it to you. It is certain that it
possesses a strange influence."</p>

<p>When Thurston had gone away the two men looked at each
other.</p>

<p>"Mad as a hatter!" said the publisher.</p>

<p>The critic shook his head.</p>

<p>"It seems strange," he said; "but, really, I don't think so.
Does he drink?"</p>

<p>"I used to think he did," replied the publisher. "He has done
work for me now and then, and he sometimes came here with all the
symptoms of intoxication upon him, and yet he was always
clear-headed and capable, if incoherent of speech. What I don't
understand just now is the frightful deliberation with which he
speaks, the sort of unearthly coldness and composure of his
manner. But&mdash;I say!&mdash;to tell us that the book is being
dictated to him by an ivory statue: surely that is an evidence of
insanity!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but then genius and insanity are closely allied," said
Flintford. "Well, let us call upon him to-morrow. In the meantime
I'll take the manuscript he left with you. I expect it will cost
me another sleepless night. You can't get away from it when you
once begin&mdash;it's a live thing, Mayne."</p>

<p>"Come round about noon to-morrow," said Mayne.</p>

<p>It was half-past twelve next day when they climbed the stairs
to Thurston's rooms. They knocked for some time at the outer door
and evoked no answer; then Flintford climbed another flight of
stairs and discovered the bedmaker woman, who resided nearer the
sky, and appeared from a feast wherein onions had played a
principal part.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thurston, sir? And indeed I 'aven't set eyes on 'im this
morning, sir. Which 'is conduck 'ave of late been most
extrornary&mdash;me not being able to make no beds, nor nothink,"
said she. "A lit'ry gent, sir, which from long ixperience is very
trying to anybody to deal with. You might knock again, sir; and
if so as he doesn't answer, why, I must open the door with my
key, and see if the poor gentleman isn't well, for never a word
did he give me at ten o'clock."</p>

<p>When the door was opened at last, they found Thurston quite
dead. His arms were crossed over the final page of his
manuscript; his head was bowed upon them, as if, tired out with
his long spell of labour, he had laid it down there and gone to
sleep. Above him, the ivory god looked out of its amethyst eyes
into the shadowy corner of the silent room.</p>
