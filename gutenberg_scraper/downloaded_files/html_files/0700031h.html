<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>I.</h2>

<p>In the swirling rain that came at dusk the broad avenue
glistened with that deep bluish tint which is so widely condemned
when it is put into pictures. There were long rows of shops, whose
fronts shone with full, golden light. Here and there, from
druggists' windows, or from the red street-lamps that indicated the
positions of fire-alarm boxes, a flare of uncertain, wavering
crimson was thrown upon the wet pavements.</p>

<p>The lights made shadows, in which the buildings loomed with a
new and tremendous massiveness, like castles and fortresses. There
were endless processions of people, mighty hosts, with umbrellas
waving, banner-like, over them. Horse-cars, aglitter with new
paint, rumbled in steady array between the pillars that supported
the elevated railroad. The whole street resounded with the tinkle
of bells, the roar of iron-shod wheels on the cobbles, the
ceaseless trample of the hundreds of feet. Above all, too, could be
heard the loud screams of the tiny newsboys, who scurried in all
directions. Upon the corners, standing in from the dripping eaves,
were many loungers, descended from the world that used to prostrate
itself before pageantry.</p>

<p>A brown young man went along the avenue. He held a tin
lunch-pail under his arm in a manner that was evidently
uncomfortable. He was puffing at a corncob pipe. His shoulders had
a self-reliant poise, and the hang of his arms and the raised veins
of his hands showed him to be a man who worked with his
muscles.</p>

<p>As he passed a street-corner, a man in old clothes gave a shout
of surprise, and, rushing impetuously forward, grasped his
hand.</p>

<p>'Hello, Kelcey, of boy!' cried the man in old clothes. 'How's
th' boy, anyhow? Where in thunder yeh been fer th' last seventeen
years? I'll be hanged if you ain't th' last man I ever expected t'
see!'</p>

<p>The brown youth put his pail to the ground and grinned. 'Well,
if it ain't of Charley Jones,' he said ecstatically, shaking hands.
'How are yeh, anyhow? Where yeh been keepin' yerself? I ain't seen
yeh fer a year.'</p>

<p>'Well, I should say so. Why, th' last time I saw you was up in
Handyville!'</p>

<p>'Sure! On Sunday, we&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Sure. Out at Bill Sickles' place. Let's go get a drink.'</p>

<p>They made toward a little glass-fronted saloon that sat blinking
jovially at the crowds. It engulfed them with a gleeful motion of
its too widely-smiling lips.</p>

<p>'What'll yeh take, Kelcey?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I guess I'll take a beer.'</p>

<p>'Gimme little whisky, John.'</p>

<p>The two friends leaned against the bar, and looked with
enthusiasm upon each other.</p>

<p>'Well, well, I'm thunderin' glad t' see yeh,' said Jones.</p>

<p>'Well, I guess,' replied Kelcey. 'Here's to yeh, of man.'</p>

<p>'Let 'er go.'</p>

<p>They lifted their glasses, glanced fervidly at each other, and
drank.</p>

<p>'Yeh ain't changed much, on'y yeh've growed like th' devil,'
said Jones reflectively, as he put down his glass; 'I'd know yeh
anywheres.'</p>

<p>'Certainly yeh would,' said Kelcey; 'an' I knew you, too, th'
minute I saw yeh. Yer changed, though.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' admitted Jones with some complacency; 'I s'pose I am.' He
regarded himself in the mirror that multiplied the bottles on the
shelf back of the bar. He should have seen a grinning face with a
rather pink nose. His derby was perched carelessly on the back part
of his head. Two wisps of hair straggled down over his hollow
temples. There was something very worldly and wise about him. Life
did not seem to confuse him. Evidently he understood its
complications. His hand thrust into his trousers-pocket, where he
jingled keys, and his hat perched back on his head, expressed a
young man of vast knowledge. His extensive acquaintance with
bar-tenders aided him materially in this habitual expression of
wisdom.</p>

<p>Having finished, he turned to the barkeeper. 'John, has any of
th' gang been in t'-night yet?'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;not yet,' said the barkeeper; 'ol Bleecker was aroun'
this afternoon about four. He said if I seen any of th' boys t'
tell 'em he'd be up t'-night if he could get away. I saw Connor an'
that other fellah goin' down th' avenyeh about an hour ago. I guess
they'll be back after awhile.'</p>

<p>'This is th' hang-out fer a great gang,' said Jones, turning to
Kelcey. 'They're a great crowd, I tell yeh. We own th' place when
we get started. Come aroun' some night. Any night,
almost&mdash;t'-night, b' jiminy! They'll almost all be here, an'
I'd like t' interduce yeh. They're a great
gang&mdash;gre-e-at!'</p>

<p>'I'd like teh,' said Kelcey.</p>

<p>'Well, come ahead, then,' cried the other cordially. 'Ye'd like
t' know 'em. It's an outa sight crowd. Come aroun' t'-night!'</p>

<p>'I will if I can.'</p>

<p>'Well, yeh ain't got anything t' do, have yeh?' demanded Jones.
'Well, come along, then. Yeh might just as well spend yer time with
a good crowd 'a fellahs. An' it's a great
gang&mdash;great&mdash;gre-e-at!'</p>

<p>'Well, I must make fer home now, anyhow,' said Kelcey. 'It's
late as blazes. What'll yeh take this time, ol' man?'</p>

<p>'Gimme little more whisky, John.'</p>

<p>'Guess I'll take another beer.'</p>

<p>Jones emptied the whisky into his large mouth, and then put the
glass upon the bar.</p>

<p>'Been in th' city long?' he asked. 'Um&mdash;well, three years
is a good deal fer a slick man. Doin' well? Oh! well, nobody's
doin' well these days.' He looked down mournfully at his shabby
clothes. 'Father's dead, ain't 'ee? Yeh don't say so? Fell off a
scaffoldin', didn't 'ee? I heard it somewheres. Mother's livin', of
course? I thought she was. Fine ol' lady&mdash;fi-i-ne! Well,
you're th' last of her boys. Was five of yeh onct, wasn't there? I
knew four m'self. Yes, five. I thought so. An' all gone but you,
hey? Well, you'll have t' brace up an' be a comfort t' th' ol'
mother. Well, well, well, who would 'a thought that on'y you'd be
left out 'a all that mob 'a tow-headed kids! Well, well, well, it's
a queer world, ain't it?'</p>

<p>A contemplation of this thought made him sad. He sighed, and
moodily watched the other sip beer.</p>

<p>'Well, well, it's a queer world&mdash;a damn queer world.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Kelcey, 'I'm th' on'y one left!' There was an accent
of discomfort in his voice. He did not like this dwelling upon a
sentiment that was connected with himself.</p>

<p>'How is th' ol' lady, anyhow?' continued Jones. Th' last time I
remember she was as spry as a little ol' cricket, an' was
helpeltin' aroun' th' country lecturin' before W. C. T. U.'s an'
one thing an' another.'</p>

<p>'Oh, she's pretty well,' said Kelcey.</p>

<p>'An' outa five boys you're th' on'y one she's got left? Well,
well&mdash;have another drink before yeh go.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I guess I've had enough.'</p>

<p>A wounded expression came into Jones's eyes. 'Oh, come on,' he
said.</p>

<p>'Well, I'll take another beer!'</p>

<p>'Gimme little more whisky, John!'</p>

<p>When they had concluded this ceremony, Jones went with his
friend to the door of the saloon. 'Good-bye, of man,' he said
genially. His homely features shone with friendliness. 'Come
aroun', now, sure. T'-night! See? They're a great crowd.
Gre-e-at!'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>II.</h2>

<p>A man with a red, mottled face put forth his head from a window
and cursed violently. He flung a bottle high across two backyards
at a window of the opposite tenement. It broke against the bricks
of the house, and the fragments fell crackling upon the stones
below. The man shook his fist.</p>

<p>A bare-armed woman, making an array of clothes on a line in one
of the yards glanced casually up at the man and listened' to his
words. Her eyes followed his to the other tenement. From a distant
window a youth with a pipe yelled some comments upon the poor aim.
Two children, being in the proper yard, picked up the bits of
broken glass and began to fondle them as new toys.</p>

<p>From the window at which the man raged came the sound of an old
voice, singing. It quavered and trembled out into the air as if a
sound-spirit had a broken wing.</p>

<p class="poem">'Should I be car-reed tew th' skies<br>
O-on flow'ry be-eds of ee-ease,<br>
While others fought tew win th' prize<br>
An' sailed through blood-ee seas?'</p>

<p>The man in the opposite window was greatly enraged. He continued
to swear.</p>

<p>A little old woman was the owner of the voice. In a fourth-story
room of the red and black tenement she was trudging on a journey.
In her arms she bore pots and pans, and sometimes a broom and
dust-pan. She wielded them like weapons. Their weight seemed to
have bended her back and crooked her arms until she walked with
difficulty. Often she plunged her hands into water at a sink. She
splashed about, the dwindled muscles working to and fro under the
loose skin of her arms. She came from the sink, steaming and
bedraggled as if she had crossed a flooded river.</p>

<p>There was the flurry of a battle in this room. Through the
clouded dust or steam one could see the thin figure dealing mighty
blows. Always her way seemed beset. Her broom was continually
poised, lance-wise, at dust demons. There came clashings and
clangings as she strove with her tireless foes.</p>

<p>It was a picture of indomitable courage. And as she went on her
way her voice was often raised in a long cry, a strange war-chant,
a shout of battle and defiance, that rose and fell in harsh
screams, and exasperated the ears of the man with the red, mottled
face.</p>

<p class="poem">'Should I be car-reed tew th' skies<br>
O-on flow'ry be-eds of ee-ease&mdash;'</p>

<p>Finally she halted for a moment. Going to the window, she sat
down and mopped her face with her apron. It was a lull, a moment of
respite. Still it could be seen that she even then was planning
skirmishes, charges, campaigns. She gazed thoughtfully about the
room, and noted the strength and position of her enemies. She was
very alert.</p>

<p>At last she returned to the mantel. 'Five o'clock,' she
murmured, scrutinizing a little, swaggering, nickel-plated
clock.</p>

<p>She looked out at chimneys growing thickly on the roofs. A man
at work on one seemed like a bee. In the intricate yards below,
vine-like lines had strange leaves of cloth. To her ears there came
the howl of the man with the red, mottled face. He was engaged in a
furious altercation with the youth who had called attention to his
poor aim. They were like animals in a jungle.</p>

<p>In the distance an enormous brewery towered over the other
buildings. Great gilt letters advertised a brand of beer. Thick
smoke came from funnels and spread near it like vast and powerful
wings. The structure seemed a great bird, flying. The letters of
the sign made a chain of gold hanging from its neck. The little old
woman looked at the brewery. It vaguely interested her, for a
moment, as a stupendous affair, a machine of mighty strength.</p>

<p>Presently she sprang from her rest and began to buffet with her
shrivelled arms. In a moment the battle was again in full swing.
Terrific blows were given and received. There arose the clattering
uproar of a new fight. The little intent warrior never hesitated
nor faltered. She fought with a strong and relentless will. Beads
and lines of perspiration stood upon her forehead.</p>

<p>Three blue plates were leaning in a row on the shelf back of the
stove. The little old woman had seen it done somewhere. In front of
them swaggered the round nickel-plated clock. Her son had stuck
many cigarette pictures in the rim of a looking-glass that hung
near. Occasional chromos were tacked upon the yellowed walls of the
room. There was one in a gilt frame. It was quite an affair in reds
and greens. They all seemed like trophies.</p>

<p>It began to grow dark. A mist came winding. Rain plashed softly
upon the window-sill. A lamp had been lighted in the opposite
tenement; the strong orange glare revealed the man with a red,
mottled face. He was seated by a table, smoking and reflecting.</p>

<p>The little old woman looked at the clock again. 'Quarter 'a
six.'</p>

<p>She had paused for a moment, but she now hurled herself fiercely
at the stove that lurked in the gloom, red-eyed, like a dragon. It
hissed, and there was renewed clangour of blows. The little old
woman dashed to and fro.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>III.</h2>

<p>As it grew toward seven o'clock the little old woman became
nervous. She often would drop into a chair and sit staring at the
little clock.</p>

<p>'I wonder why he don't come,' she continually repeated. There
was a small, curious note of despair in her voice. As she sat
thinking and staring at the clock, the expressions of her face
changed swiftly. All manner of emotions flickered in her eyes and
about her lips. She was evidently perceiving in her imagination the
journey of a loved person. She dreamed for him mishaps and
obstacles. Something tremendous and irritating was hindering him
from coming to her.</p>

<p>She had lighted an oil-lamp. It flooded the room with vivid
yellow glare. The table, in its oil-cloth covering, had previously
appeared like a bit of bare, brown desert. It now was a white
garden, growing the fruits of her labour.</p>

<p>'Seven o'clock!' she murmured finally. She was aghast.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she heard a step upon the stair. She sprang up and
began to bustle about the room. The little fearful emotions passed
at once from her face. She seemed now to be ready to scold.</p>

<p>Young Kelcey entered the room. He gave a sigh of relief, and
dropped his pail in a corner. He was evidently greatly wearied by a
hard day of toil.</p>

<p>The little old woman hobbled over to him and raised her wrinkled
lips. She seemed on the verge of tears and an outburst of
reproaches.</p>

<p>'Hello!' he cried, in a voice of cheer. 'Been gettin'
anxious?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said, hovering about him.</p>

<p>'Where yeh been, George? What made yeh so late? I've been
waitin' th' longest while. Don't throw your coat down there. Hang
it up behind th' door.'</p>

<p>The son put his coat on the proper hook, and then went to
splatter water in a tin wash-basin at the sink.</p>

<p>'Well, yeh see, I met Jones&mdash;you remember Jones? Ol'
Handyville fellah. An' we had t' stop an' talk over of times. Jones
is quite a boy.'</p>

<p>The little old woman's mouth set in a sudden straight line. 'Oh,
that Jones!' she said. 'I don't like him.'</p>

<p>The youth interrupted a flurry of white towel to give a glance
of irritation.</p>

<p>'Well, now, what's th' use of talkin' that way?' he said to her.
'What do yeh know 'bout 'im? Ever spoke to 'im in yer life?'</p>

<p>'Well, I don't know as I ever did since he grew up,' replied the
little old woman. But I know he ain't th' kind 'a man I'd like t'
have you go around with. He ain't a good man. I'm sure he ain't. He
drinks.'</p>

<p>Her son began to laugh. 'Th' dickens he does!'</p>

<p>He seemed amazed, but not shocked, at this information.</p>

<p>She nodded her head with the air of one who discloses a dreadful
thing. 'I'm sure of it! Once I saw 'im comin' outa Simpson's Hotel,
up in Handyville, an' he could hardly walk. He drinks! I'm sure he
drinks!'</p>

<p>'Holy smoke!' said Kelcey.</p>

<p>They sat down at the table and began to wreck the little white
garden. The youth leaned back in his chair, in the manner of a man
who is paying for things. His mother bended alertly forward,
apparently watching each mouthful. She perched on the edge of her
chair, ready to spring to her feet and run to the closet or the
stove for anything that he might need. She was as anxious as a
young mother with a babe. In the careless and comfortable attitude
of the son there was denoted a great deal of dignity.</p>

<p>'Yeh ain't eatin' much t'-night, George?'</p>

<p>'Well, I ain't very hungry, t' tell th' truth.'</p>

<p>'Don't yeh like yer supper, dear? Yeh must eat somethin', chile.
Yeh mustn't go without.'</p>

<p>'Well, I'm eatin' somethin', ain't I?'</p>

<p>He wandered aimlessly through the meal. She sat over behind the
little blackened coffee-pot and gazed affectionately upon him.</p>

<p>After a time she began to grow agitated. Her worn fingers were
gripped. It could be seen that a great thought was within her. She
was about to venture something. She had arrived at a supreme
moment. 'George,' she said suddenly, 'come t' prayer-meetin' with
me t'-night.'</p>

<p>The young man dropped his fork.</p>

<p>'Say, you must be crazy!' he said in amazement.</p>

<p>'Yes, dear,' she continued rapidly, in a small, pleading voice,
'I'd like t' have yeh go with me onct in a while. Yeh never go with
me any more, dear, an' I d like t' have yeh go. Yeh ain't been
anywheres at all with me in th' longest while.'</p>

<p>'Well,' he said&mdash;'well; but what th' blazes&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Ah, come on!' said the little old woman. She went to him, and
put her arms about his neck. She began to coax him with
caresses.</p>

<p>The young man grinned. 'Thunderation!' he said; 'what would I do
at a prayer-meetin'?'</p>

<p>The mother considered him to be consenting. She did a little
antique caper.</p>

<p>Well, yeh can come an' take care 'a yer mother,' she cried
gleefully. 'It's such a long walk every Thursday night alone, an'
don't yeh s'pose that when I have such a big, fine, strappin' boy I
want 'im t' beau me aroun' some? Ah, I knew ye'd come!'</p>

<p>He smiled for a moment, indulgent of her humour. But presently
his face turned a shade of discomfort. 'But&mdash;' he began,
protesting.</p>

<p>'Ah, come on!' she continually repeated.</p>

<p>He began to be vexed. He frowned into the air. A vision came to
him of dreary blackness arranged in solemn rows. A mere dream of it
was depressing.</p>

<p>'But&mdash;' he said again. He was obliged to make great search
for an argument. Finally he concluded: 'But what th' blazes would I
do at prayer-meetin'?'</p>

<p>In his ears was the sound of a hymn, made by people who tilted
their heads at a prescribed angle of devotion. It would be too
apparent that they were all better than he. When he entered they
would turn their heads and regard him with suspicion. This would be
an enormous aggravation, since he was certain that he was as good
as they.</p>

<p>'Well, now, y' see,' he said, quite gently, 'I don't wanta go,
an' it wouldn't do me no good t' go if I didn't wanta go.'</p>

<p>His mother's face swiftly changed. She breathed a huge sigh, the
counterpart of ones he had heard upon like occasions. She put a
tiny black bonnet on her head, and wrapped her figure in an old
shawl. She cast a martyr-like glance upon her son, and went
mournfully away. She resembled a limited funeral procession.</p>

<p>The young man writhed under it to an extent. He kicked moodily
at a table-leg. When the sound of her footfalls died away he felt
distinctly relieved.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>IV</h2>

<p>That night, when Kelcey arrived at the little smiling saloon, he
found his friend Jones standing before the bar engaged in a violent
argument with a stout man.</p>

<p>'Oh, well,' this latter person was saying, 'you can make a lot
of noise, Charley, for a man that never says anything&mdash;let's
have a drink!'</p>

<p>Jones was waving his arms and delivering splintering blows upon
some distant theories. The stout man chuckled fatly and winked at
the bar-tender.</p>

<p>The orator ceased for a moment to say, 'Gimme little whisky,
John.' At the same time he perceived young Kelcey. He sprang
forward with a welcoming cry. 'Hello, of man! didn't much think
ye'd come.' He led him to the stout man.</p>

<p>'Mr. Bleecker&mdash;my friend Mr. Kelcey!'</p>

<p>'How d'yeh do?'</p>

<p>'Mr. Kelcey, I'm happy to meet you, sir; have a drink.'</p>

<p>They drew up in line and waited. The busy hands of the
bar-tender made glasses clink. Mr. Bleecker, in a very polite way,
broke the waiting silence.</p>

<p>'Never been here before, I believe, have you, Mr. Kelcey?'</p>

<p>The young man felt around for a highbred reply.
'Er&mdash;no&mdash;I've never had that&mdash;er&mdash;pleasure,' he
said.</p>

<p>After a time the strained and wary courtesy of their manners
wore away. It became evident to Bleecker that his importance
slightly dazzled the young man. He grew warmer. Obviously, the
youth was one whose powers of perception were developed. Directly,
then, he launched forth into a tale of bygone days, when the world
was better. He had known all the great men of that age. He
reproduced his conversations with them. There were traces of pride
and of mournfulness in his voice. He rejoiced at the glory of the
world of dead spirits. He grieved at the youth and flippancy of the
present one. He lived with his head in the clouds of the past, and
he seemed obliged to talk of what he saw there.</p>

<p>Jones nudged Kelcey ecstatically in the ribs. 'You've got th' of
man started in great shape,' he whispered.</p>

<p>Kelcey was proud that the prominent character of the place
talked at him, glancing into his eyes for appreciation of fine
points.</p>

<p>Presently they left the bar, and going into a little rear room,
took seats about a table. A gas-jet with a coloured globe shed a
crimson radiance. The polished wood of walls and furniture gleamed
with faint rose-coloured reflections. Upon the floor sawdust was
thickly sprinkled.</p>

<p>Two other men presently came. By the time Bleecker had told
three tales of the grand past, Kelcey was slightly acquainted with
everybody.</p>

<p>He admired Bleecker immensely. He developed a brotherly feeling
for the others, who were all gentle-spoken. He began to feel that
he was passing the happiest evening of his life. His companions
were so jovial and good-natured; and everything they did was marked
by such courtesy.</p>

<p>For a time the two men who had come in late did not presume to
address him directly. They would say: 'Jones, won't your friend
have so and so, or so and so?' And Bleecker would begin his
orations: 'Now, Mr. Kelcey, don't you think&mdash;'</p>

<p>Presently he began to believe that he was a most remarkably fine
fellow, who had at last found his place in a crowd of most
remarkably fine fellows.</p>

<p>Jones occasionally breathed comments into his ear.</p>

<p>'I tell yeh, Bleecker's an ol'-timer. He was a husky guy in his
day, yeh can bet. He was one 'a th' best known men in N' York once.
Yeh ought to hear him tell about&mdash;'</p>

<p>Kelcey listened intently. He was profoundly interested in these
intimate tales of men who had gleamed in the rays of old suns.</p>

<p>'That O'Connor's a damn fine fellah,' interjected Jones once,
referring to one of the others; 'he's one 'a th' best fellahs I
ever knowed. He's always on th' dead level, an' he's always jest
th' same as yeh see him now&mdash;good-natured an' grinnin'.'</p>

<p>Kelcey nodded. He could well believe it.</p>

<p>When he offered to buy drinks there came a loud volley of
protests. 'No, no, Mr. Kelcey,' cried Bleecker; 'no, no. To-night
you are our guest. Some other time&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Here,' said O'Connor; 'it's my turn now.'</p>

<p>He called and pounded for the bar-tender. He then sat with a
coin in hand warily eyeing the others. He was ready to frustrate
them if they offered to pay.</p>

<p>After a time Jones began to develop qualities of great eloquence
and wit. His companions laughed. 'It's the whisky talking now,'
said Bleecker.</p>

<p>He grew earnest and impassioned; he delivered speeches on
various subjects. His lectures were to him very imposing. The force
of his words thrilled him. Sometimes he was overcome.</p>

<p>The others agreed with him in all things. Bleecker grew almost
tender, and considerately placed words here and there for his use.
As Jones became fiercely energetic the others became more docile in
agreeing. They soothed him with friendly interjections.</p>

<p>His mode changed directly. He began to sing popular airs with
enthusiasm. He congratulated his companions upon being in his
society. They were excited by his frenzy. They began to fraternize
in jovial fashion. It was understood that they were true and tender
spirits. They had come away from a grinding world filled with men
who were harsh.</p>

<p>When one of them chose to divulge some place where the world had
pierced him, there was a chorus of violent sympathy. They rejoiced
at their temporary isolation and safety.</p>

<p>Once a man, completely drunk, stumbled along the floor of the
saloon. He opened the door of the little room and made a show of
entering. The men sprang instantly to their feet. They were ready
to throttle any invader of their island. They elbowed each other in
rivalry as to who should take upon himself the brunt of an
encounter.</p>

<p>'Oh!' said the drunken individual, swaying on his legs and
blinking at the party' oh! thish private room?'</p>

<p>'That's what it is, Willie,' said Jones. 'An' you git outa here,
er we'll throw yeh out.'</p>

<p>'That's what we will,' said the others.</p>

<p>'Oh!' said the drunken man. He blinked at them aggrievedly for
an instant and then went away.</p>

<p>They sat down again. Kelcey felt in a way that he would have
liked to display his fidelity to the others by whipping the
intruder.</p>

<p>The bar-tender came often. 'Gee, you fellahs er tanks!' he said
in a jocular manner, as he gathered empty glasses and polished the
table with his little towel.</p>

<p>Through the exertions of Jones, the little room began to grow
clamorous. The tobacco smoke eddied about the forms of the men in
ropes and wreaths. Near the ceiling there was a thick gray
cloud.</p>

<p>Each man explained in his way that he was totally out of place
in the before-mentioned world. They were possessed of various
virtues, which were unappreciated by those with whom they were
commonly obliged to mingle&mdash;they were fitted for a tree-shaded
land, where everything was peace.</p>

<p>Now that five of them had congregated, it gave them happiness to
speak their inmost thoughts without fear of being
misunderstood.</p>

<p>As he drank more beer Kelcey felt his breast expand with manly
feeling. He knew that he was capable of sublime things. He wished
that some day one of his present companions would come to him for
relief. His mind pictured a little scene. In it he was magnificent
in his friendship.</p>

<p>He looked upon the beaming faces and knew that if at that
instant there should come a time for a great sacrifice he would
blissfully make it. He would pass tranquilly into the unknown, or
into bankruptcy, amid the ejaculations of his companions upon his
many virtues.</p>

<p>They had no bickerings during the evening. If one chose to
momentarily assert himself, the others instantly submitted.</p>

<p>They exchanged compliments. Once old Bleecker stared at Jones
for a few moments. Suddenly he broke out:</p>

<p>'Jones, you're one of the finest fellows I ever knew!'</p>

<p>A flush of pleasure went over the other's face, and then he made
a modest gesture, the protest of a humble man.</p>

<p>'Don't flimflam me, of boy,' he said with earnestness.</p>

<p>But Bleecker roared that he was serious about it.</p>

<p>The two men arose and shook hands emotionally. Jones butted
against the table and knocked off a glass.</p>

<p>Afterward a general hand-shaking was inaugurated. Brotherly
sentiments flew about the room. There was an uproar of fraternal
feeling.</p>

<p>Jones began to sing. He beat time with precision and dignity. He
gazed into the eyes of his companions, trying to call music from
their souls. O'Connor joined in heartily, but with another tune.
Off in a corner old Bleecker was making a speech.</p>

<p>The bar-tender came to the door. 'Gee, you fellahs er making a
row. It's time fer me t' shut up th' front th' place, an' you mugs
better sit on yerselves. It's one o'clock.'</p>

<p>They began to argue with him. Kelcey, however, sprang to his
feet. 'One o'clock?' he said. 'Holy smoke, I mus' be flyin'!'</p>

<p>There came protesting howls from Jones. Bleecker ceased his
oration.</p>

<p>'My dear boy&mdash;' he began.</p>

<p>Kelcey searched for his hat.</p>

<p>'I've gota go t' work at seven,' he said.</p>

<p>The others watched him with discomfort in their eyes.</p>

<p>'Well,' said O'Connor, 'if one goes we might as well all
go.'</p>

<p>They sadly took their hats and filed out.</p>

<p>The cold air of the street filled Kelcey with vague surprise. It
made his head feel hot. As for his legs, they were like
willow-twigs.</p>

<p>A few yellow lights blinked. In front of an all-night restaurant
a huge red electric lamp hung and sputtered. Horse-car bells
jingled far down the street. Overhead a train thundered on the
elevated road.</p>

<p>On the sidewalk the men took fervid leave. They clutched hands
with extraordinary force, and proclaimed, for the last time, ardent
and admiring friendships.</p>

<p>When he arrived at his home Kelcey proceeded with caution. His
mother had left a light burning low. He stumbled once in his voyage
across the floor. As he paused to listen he heard the sound of
little snores coming from her room.</p>

<p>He lay awake for a few moments and thought of the evening. He
had a pleasurable consciousness that he had made a good impression
upon those fine fellows. He felt that he had spent the most
delightful evening of his life.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>V.</h2>

<p>Kelcey was cross in the morning. His mother had been obliged to
shake him a great deal, and it had seemed to him a most unjust
thing. Also, when he, blinking his eyes, had entered the kitchen,
she had said: 'Yeh left th' lamp burnin' all night last night,
George. How many times must I tell yeh never t' leave th' lamp
burnin'?'</p>

<p>He ate the greater part of his breakfast in silence, moodily
stirring his coffee, and glaring at a remote corner of the room
with eyes that felt as if they had been baked. When he moved his
eyelids there was a sensation that they were cracking. In his mouth
there was a singular taste. It seemed to him that he had been
sucking the end of a wooden spoon. Moreover, his temper was rampant
within him. It sought something to devour.</p>

<p>Finally he said savagely: 'Damn these early hours!'</p>

<p>His mother jumped as if he had flung a missile at her. 'Why,
George&mdash;' she began.</p>

<p>Kelcey broke in again. 'Oh, I know all that; but this gettin' up
in th' mornin' so early makes me sick. Jest when a man is gettin'
his mornin' nap he's gota get up. I&mdash;'</p>

<p>'George, dear,' said his mother, 'yeh know how I hate yeh t'
swear, dear. Now, please don't.' She looked beseechingly at
him.</p>

<p>He made a swift gesture. 'Well, I ain't swearin', am I?' he
demanded. 'I was on'y sayin' that this gettin'-up business gives me
a pain, wasn't I?'</p>

<p>Well, yeh know how swearin' hurts me,' protested the little old
woman. She seemed about to sob. She gazed off retrospectively. She
apparently was recalling persons who had never been profane.</p>

<p>'I don't see where yeh ever caught this way 'a swearin' out at
everything,' she continued presently. 'Fred, ner John, ner Willie
never swore a bit. Ner Tom neither, except when he was real
mad.'</p>

<p>The son made another gesture. It was directed into the air, as
if he saw there a phantom injustice. 'Oh, good thunder!' he said,
with an accent of despair. Thereupon he relapsed into a mood of
silence. He sombrely regarded his plate.</p>

<p>This demeanour speedily reduced his mother to meekness. When she
spoke again it was in a conciliatory voice. 'George, dear, won't
yeh bring some sugar home t'-night?' It could be seen that she was
asking for a crown of gold.</p>

<p>Kelcey aroused from his semi-slumber.</p>

<p>'Yes, if I kin remember it,' he said.</p>

<p>The little old woman arose to stow her son's lunch into the
pail. When he had finished his breakfast he stalked for a time
about the room in a dignified way. He put on his coat and hat, and,
taking his lunch-pail, went to the door. There he halted, and
without turning his head, stiffly said:</p>

<p>'Well, good-bye.'</p>

<p>The little old woman saw that she had offended her son. She did
not seek an explanation. She was accustomed to these phenomena. She
made haste to surrender.</p>

<p>'Ain't yeh goin' t' kiss me good-bye?' she asked in a little
woful voice.</p>

<p>The youth made a pretence of going on deaf-heartedly. He wore
the dignity of an injured monarch.</p>

<p>Then the little old woman called again in forsaken accents:
'George&mdash;George! ain't yeh goin' t' kiss me good-bye?' When he
moved he found that she was hanging to his coat-tails.</p>

<p>He turned eventually with a murmur of a sort of tenderness.
'Why, 'a course I am,' he said. He kissed her. Withal, there was an
undertone of superiority in his voice, as if he were granting an
astonishing suit. She looked at him with reproach and gratitude and
affection.</p>

<p>She stood at the head of the stairs and watched his hand sliding
along the rail as he went down. Occasionally she could see his arm
and part of his shoulder. When he reached the first-floor she
called to him 'Good-bye!'</p>

<p>The little old woman went back to her work in the kitchen with a
frown of perplexity upon her brow. 'I wonder what was th' matter
with George this mornin',' she mused. 'He didn't seem a bit like
himself!'</p>

<p>As she trudged to and fro at her labour she began to speculate.
She was much worried. She surmised in a vague way that he was a
sufferer from a great internal disease. It was something, no doubt,
that devoured the kidneys or quietly fed upon the lungs. Later, she
imagined a woman, wicked and fair, who had fascinated him, and was
turning his life into a bitter thing. Her mind created many
wondrous influences that were swooping like green dragons at him.
They were changing him to a morose man, who suffered silently. She
longed to discover them, that she might go bravely to the rescue of
her heroic son. She knew that he, generous in his pain, would keep
it from her. She racked her mind for knowledge.</p>

<p>However, when he came home at night he was extraordinarily
blithe. He seemed to be a lad of ten. He capered all about the
room. When she was bringing the coffee-pot from the stove to the
table he made show of waltzing with her, so that she spilled some
of the coffee. She was obliged to scold him.</p>

<p>All through the meal he made jokes. She occasionally was
compelled to laugh, despite the fact that she believed that she
should not laugh at her own son's jokes. She uttered reproofs at
times, but he did not regard them.</p>

<p>'Golly,' he said once, 'I feel fine as silk. I didn't think I'd
get over feelin' bad so quick. It&mdash;' He stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>During the evening he sat content. He smoked his pipe and read
from an evening paper. She bustled about at her work. She seemed
utterly happy with him there, lazily puffing out little clouds of
smoke and giving frequent brilliant dissertations upon the news of
the day. It seemed to her that she must be a model mother to have
such a son, one who came home to her at night and sat contented, in
a languor of the muscles after a good day's toil. She pondered upon
the science of her management.</p>

<p>The week thereafter, too, she was joyous, for he stayed at home
each night of it, and was sunny-tempered. She became convinced that
she was a perfect mother, rearing a perfect son. There came often a
lovelight into her eyes. The wrinkled, yellow face frequently
warmed into a smile of the kind that a maiden bestows upon him who
to her is first and perhaps last.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>VI.</h2>

<p>The little old woman habitually discouraged all outbursts of
youthful vanity on the part of her son. She feared that he would
get to think too much of himself, and she knew that nothing could
do more harm. Great self-esteem was always passive, she thought,
and if he grew to regard his qualities of mind as forming a
dazzling constellation, he would tranquilly sit still and not do
those wonders she expected of him. So she was constantly on the
alert to suppress even a shadow of such a thing. As for him, he
ruminated with the savage, vengeful bitterness of a young man, and
decided that she did not comprehend him.</p>

<p>But, despite her precautions, he often saw that she believed him
to be the most marvellous young man on the earth. He had only to
look at those two eyes that became lighted with a glow from her
heart whenever he did some excessively brilliant thing. On these
occasions he could see her glance triumphantly at a neighbour, or
whoever happened to be present. He grew to plan for these glances.
And then he took a vast satisfaction in detecting and appropriating
them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he could not understand why, directly after a
scene of this kind, his mother was liable to call to him to hang
his coat on the hook under the mantel, her voice in a key of
despair, as if he were negligent and stupid in what was, after all,
the only important thing in life.</p>

<p>'If yeh'll only get in the habit of doin' it, it'll be jest as
easy as throwin' it down anywheres,' she would say to him. 'When ye
pitch it down anywheres, somebody's got t' pick it up, an' that'll
most likely be your poor of mother. Yeh can hang it up yerself, if
yeh'll on'y think.' This was intolerable. He usually went then and
hurled his coat savagely at the hook. The correctness of her
position was maddening.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that anyone who had a son of his glowing
attributes should overlook the fact that he seldom hung up his
coat. It was impossible to explain this situation to his mother.
She was unutterably narrow. He grew sullen.</p>

<p>There came a time, too, that, even in all his mother's
tremendous admiration for him, he did not entirely agree with her.
He was delighted that she liked his great wit. He spurred himself
to new and flashing effort because of this appreciation.</p>

<p>But for the greater part he could see that his mother took pride
in him in quite a different way from that in which he took pride in
himself. She rejoiced at qualities in him that indicated that he
was going to become a white and looming king among men. From these
she made pictures, in which he appeared as a benign personage,
blessed by the filled hands of the poor&mdash;one whose brain could
hold massive thoughts, and awe certain men about whom she had read.
She was f�ted as the mother of this enormous man. These dreams were
her solace. She spoke of them to no one, because she knew that,
worded, they would be ridiculous. But she dwelt with them, and they
shed a radiance of gold upon her long days, her sorry labour. Upon
the dead altars of her life she had builded the little fires of
hope for another.</p>

<p>Kelcey had a complete sympathy for as much as he understood of
these thoughts of his mother. They were so wise that he admired her
foresight. As for himself, however, most of his dreams were of a
nearer time. He had many of the distant future when he would be a
man with a cloak of coldness concealing his gentleness and his
faults, and of whom the men, and more particularly the women, would
think with reverence. He agreed with his mother that at that time
he would go through what were obstacles to other men, like a flung
stone. And then he would have power, and he would enjoy having his
bounty and his wrath alike fall swiftly upon those below. They
would be awed. And, above all, he would mystify them.</p>

<p>But then his nearer dreams were a multitude. He had begun to
look at the great world revolving near to his nose. He had a vast
curiosity concerning this city in whose complexities he was buried.
It was an impenetrable mystery, this city. It was a blend of many
enticing colours. He longed to comprehend it completely, that he
might walk understandingly in its greatest marvels, its mightiest
march of life, of sin. He dreamed of a comprehension whose pay was
the admirable attitude of a man of knowledge. He remembered Jones.
He could not help admiring a man who knew so many bartenders.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>VII.</h2>

<p>An indefinite woman was in all of Kelcey's dreams. As a matter
of fact, it was not himself he pictured as wedding her. It was a
vision of a man, greater, finer, more terrible. It was himself as
he expected to be. In scenes which he took mainly from pictures,
this vision conducted a courtship, strutting, posing, and lying
through a drama which was magnificent from glow of purple. In it he
was icy, self-possessed; but she, the dream-girl, was consumed by
wild, torrential passion. He went to the length of having her
display it before the people.</p>

<p>He saw them wonder at his tranquillity. It amazed them
infinitely to see him remain cold before the glory of this peerless
woman's love. She was to him as beseeching for affection as a pet
animal, but still he controlled appearances, and none knew of his
deep, abiding love. Some day, at the critical romantic time, he was
going to divulge it. In these long dreams there were accessories of
castle-like houses, wide lands, servants, horses, clothes.</p>

<p>They began somewhere in his childhood. When he ceased to see
himself as a stern general pointing a sword at the nervous and
abashed horizon, he became this sublime king of a vague woman's
heart. Later, when he had read some books, it all achieved clearer
expression. He was told in them that there was a goddess in the
world whose business it was to wait until he should exchange a
glance with her. It became a creed, subtly powerful. It saved
discomfort for him and for several women who flitted by him. He
used her as a standard.</p>

<p>Often he saw the pathos of her long wait, but his faith did not
falter. The world was obliged to turn gold in time. His life was to
be fine and heroic, else he would not have been born. He believed
that the commonplace lot was the sentence, the doom of certain
people who did not know how to feel. His blood was a tender current
of life. He thought that the usual should fall to others whose
nerves were of lead.</p>

<p>Occasionally he wondered how fate was going to begin in making
an enormous figure of him; but he had no doubt of the result. A
chariot of pink clouds was coming for him. His faith was his reason
for existence. Meanwhile, he could dream of the indefinite woman
and the fragrance of roses that came from her hair.</p>

<p>One day he met Maggie Johnson on the stairs. She had a can of
beer in one hand and a brown-paper parcel under her arm. She
glanced at him. He discovered that it would wither his heart to see
another man signally successful in the smiles of her. And the
glance that she gave him was so indifferent and so unresponsive to
the sudden vivid admiration in his own eyes that he immediately
concluded that she was magnificent in two ways.</p>

<p>As she came to the landing, the light from a window passed in a
silver gleam over the girlish roundness of her cheek. It was a
thing that he remembered.</p>

<p>He was silent for the most part at supper that night. He was
particularly unkind when he did speak. His mother, observing him
apprehensively, tried in vain to picture the new terrible
catastrophe. She eventually concluded that he did not like the
beef-stew. She put more salt in it.</p>

<p>He saw Maggie quite frequently after the meeting upon the
stairs. He reconstructed his dreams and placed her in the full
glory of that sun. The dream-woman, the goddess, pitched from her
pedestal, lay prostrate, unheeded, save when he brought her forth
to call her insipid and childish in the presence of his new
religion.</p>

<p>He was relatively happy sometimes when Maggie's mother would get
drunk and make terrific uproars. He used then to sit in the dark
and make scenes in which he rescued the girl from her hideous
environment.</p>

<p>He laid clever plans by which he encountered her in the halls,
at the door, on the street. When he succeeded in meeting her he was
always overcome by the thought that the whole thing was obvious to
her. He could feel the shame of it burn his face and neck.</p>

<p>To prove to her that she was mistaken he would turn away his
head or regard her with a granite stare.</p>

<p>After a time he became impatient of the distance between them.
He saw looming princes who would aim to seize her. Hours of his
leisure and certain hours of his labour he spent in contriving. The
shade of this girl was with him continually. With her he builded
his grand dramas so that he trod in clouds, the matters of his
daily life obscured and softened by a mist.</p>

<p>He saw that he need only break down the slight conventional
barriers, and she would soon discover his noble character.
Sometimes he could see it all in his mind. It was very skilful; but
then his courage flew away at the supreme moment. Perhaps the whole
affair was humorous to her. Perhaps she was watching his mental
contortions. She might laugh. He felt that he would then die or
kill her. He could not approach the dread moment. He sank often
from the threshold of knowledge. Directly after these occasions it
was his habit to avoid her, to prove that she was a cipher to
him.</p>

<p>He reflected that if he could only get a chance to rescue her
from something, the whole tragedy would speedily unwind.</p>

<p>He met a young man in the halls one evening who said to him:
'Say, me frien', where d' d' Johnson birds live in, heh? I can't
fin' me feet in dis bloomin' joint. I been battin' round heh fer a
half hour.'</p>

<p>'Two flights up,' said Kelcey stonily. He had felt a sudden
quiver of his heart. The grandeur of the clothes, the fine worldly
air, the experience, the self-reliance, the courage that shone in
the countenance of this other young man, made him suddenly sink to
the depths of woe. He stood listening in the hall, flushing and
ashamed of it, until he heard them coming downstairs together. He
slunk away then. It would have been a horror to him if she had
discovered him there. She might have felt sorry for him.</p>

<p>They were going out to a show, perhaps. That pig of the world in
his embroidered cloak was going to dazzle her with splendour. He
mused upon how unrighteous it was for other men to dazzle women
with splendour.</p>

<p>As he appreciated his handicap, he swore with savage, vengeful
bitterness. In his home his mother raised her voice in a high key
of monotonous irritability.</p>

<p>'Hang up yer coat, cant yeh, George?' she cried at him; 'I can't
go round after yeh all th' time. It's jest as easy t' hang it up as
it is t' throw it down that way. Don't yeh ever git tired 'a
hearing me yell at yeh?'</p>

<p>'Yes!' he exploded. In this word he put a profundity of sudden
anger. He turned toward his mother a face red, seamed, hard with
hate and rage. They stared a moment in silence. Then she turned and
staggered toward her room. Her hip struck violently against the
corner of the table during this blind passage. A moment later the
door closed.</p>

<p>Kelcey sank down in a chair with his legs thrust out straight
and his hands deep in his trousers-pockets. His chin was forward
upon his breast, and his eyes stared before him. There swept over
him all the self-pity that comes when the soul is turned back from
a road.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>VIII.</h2>

<p>During the next few days Kelcey suffered from his first gloomy
conviction that the earth was not grateful to him for his presence
upon it. When sharp words were said to him, he interpreted them
with what seemed to be a lately acquired insight. He could now
perceive that the universe hated him. He sank to the most sublime
depths of despair.</p>

<p>One evening of this period he met Jones. The latter rushed upon
him with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>'Why, yer jest th' man I wanted t' see! I was comin' round t'
your place t'-night. Lucky I met yeh! Ol' Bleecker's goin' t' give
a blow-out t'-morrah night. Anything yeh want t' drink! All th'
boys'll be there, an' everything. He tol' me expressly that he
wanted yeh t' be there. Great time! Great! Can yeh come?'</p>

<p>Kelcey grasped the other's hand with fervour. He felt now that
there was some solacing friendship in space.</p>

<p>'You bet I will, of man,' he said huskily. 'I'd like nothin'
better in th' world!'</p>

<p>As he walked home he thought that he was a very grim figure. He
was about to taste the delicious revenge of a partial
self-destruction. The universe would regret its position when it
saw him drunk. He was a little late in getting to Bleecker's
lodging. He was delayed while his mother read aloud a letter from
an old uncle, who wrote in one place: 'God bless th' boy! Bring him
up to be the man his father was.'</p>

<p>Bleecker lived in an old three-storied house on a side-street. A
Jewish tailor lived and worked in the front parlour, and old
Bleecker lived in the back parlour. A German, whose family took
care of the house, occupied the basement. Another German, with a
wife and eight children, rented the dining-room. The two upper
floors were inhabited by tailors, dressmakers, a pedlar, and
mysterious people who were seldom seen. The door of the little
hall-bedroom, at the foot of the second flight, was always open,
and in there could be seen two bended men who worked at mending
opera-glasses.</p>

<p>The German woman in the dining-room was not friends with the
little dressmaker in the rear room of the third floor, and
frequently they yelled the vilest names up and down between the
balusters. Each part of the woodwork was scratched and rubbed by
the contact of innumerable persons. In one wall there was a long
slit with chipped edges, celebrating the time when a man had thrown
a hatchet at his wife. In the lower hall there was an eternal
woman, with a rag and a pail of suds, who knelt over the worn
oilcloth. Old Bleecker felt that he had quite respectable and
high-class apartments. He was glad to invite his friends.</p>

<p>Bleecker met Kelcey in the hall. He wore a collar that was
cleaner and higher than his usual one. It changed his appearance
greatly. He was now formidably aristocratic.</p>

<p>'How are yeh, of man?' he shouted. He grasped Kelcey's arm, and,
babbling jovially, conducted him down the hall and into the
ex-parlour.</p>

<p>A group of standing men made vast shadows in the yellow glare of
the lamp. They turned their heads as the two entered.</p>

<p>'Why, hello, Kelcey, of man!' Jones exclaimed, coming rapidly
forward. 'Good fer you! Glad yeh come! Yeh know O'Connor, 'a
course! an' Schmidt! an' Woods! Then there's Zeusentell! Mr.
Zeusentell&mdash;my friend Mr. Kelcey! Shake hands&mdash;both good
fellows, damnitall! Then here is&mdash;oh, gentlemen, my friend Mr.
Kelcey! A good fellow he is, too. I've known 'im since I was a kid.
Come, have a drink!'</p>

<p>Everybody was excessively amiable. Kelcey felt that he had
social standing. The strangers were cautious and respectful.</p>

<p>'By all means,' said old Bleecker. 'Mr. Kelcey, have a drink!
An' by th' way, gentlemen, while we're about it, let's all have a
drink!' There was much laughter. Bleecker was so droll at
times.</p>

<p>With mild and polite gesturing they marched up to the table.
There were upon it a keg of beer, a long row of whisky bottles, a
little heap of corn-cob pipes, some bags of tobacco, a box of
cigars, and a mighty collection of glasses, cups, and mugs. Old
Bleecker had arranged them so deftly that they resembled a
primitive bar. There was considerable scuffling for possession of
the cracked cups.</p>

<p>Jones politely but vehemently insisted upon drinking from the
worst of the assortment. He was quietly opposed by others.
Everybody showed that they were awed by Bleecker's lavish
hospitality. Their demeanours expressed their admiration at the
cast of this entertainment.</p>

<p>Kelcey took his second mug of beer away to a corner and sat down
with it. He wished to socially reconnoitre. Over in a corner a man
was telling a story, in which at intervals he grunted like a pig. A
half-dozen men were listening. Two or three others sat alone in
isolated places. They looked expectantly bright, ready to burst out
cordially if anyone should address them.</p>

<p>The row of bottles made quaint shadows upon the table, and upon
a side-wall the keg of beer created a portentous black figure that
reared toward the ceiling, hovering over the room and its inmates
with spectral stature. Tobacco-smoke lay in lazy cloud-banks
overhead.</p>

<p>Jones and O'Connor stayed near the table, occasionally being
affable in all directions. Kelcey saw old Bleecker go to them, and
heard him whisper:</p>

<p>'Come, we must git th' thing started. Git th' thing
started.'</p>

<p>Kelcey saw that the host was fearing that all were not having a
good time. Jones conferred with O'Connor, and then O'Connor went to
the man named Zeusentell. O'Connor evidently proposed something.
Zeusentell refused at once. O'Connor beseeched. Zeusentell remained
implacable.</p>

<p>At last O'Connor broke off his argument, and going to the centre
of the room, held up his hand.</p>

<p>'Gentlemen!' he shouted loudly, 'we will now have a recitation
by Mr. Zeusentell, entitled "Patrick Clancy's Pig!" He then glanced
triumphantly at Zeusentell and said: 'Come on!'</p>

<p>Zeusentell had been twisting and making pantomimic appeals. He
said in a reproachful whisper:</p>

<p>'You son of a gun!'</p>

<p>The men turned their heads to glance at Zeusentell for a moment,
and then burst into a sustained clamour.</p>

<p>'Hurray! Let 'er go! Come&mdash;give it t' us! Spring it! Spring
it! Let it come!'</p>

<p>As Zeusentell made no advances, they appealed personally.</p>

<p>'Come, ol' man, let 'er go! Whatter yeh 'fraid of? Let 'er go!
Go ahn! Hurry up!'</p>

<p>Zeusentell was protesting with almost frantic modesty. O'Connor
took him by the lapel and tried to drag him; but he leaned back,
pulling at his coat and shaking his head.</p>

<p>'No, no! I don't know it, I tell yeh! I can't! I don't know it!
I tell yeh I don't know it! I've forgotten it, I tell yeh!
No&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;no! Ah, say, lookahere, le' go me, can't
yeh? What's th' matter with yeh? I tell yeh I don't know it!'</p>

<p>The men applauded violently. O'Connor did not relent. A little
battle was waged until all of a sudden Zeusentell was seen to grow
wondrously solemn. A hush fell upon the men. He was about to begin.
He paused in the middle of the floor and nervously adjusted his
collar and cravat. The audience became grave.</p>

<p>'"Patrick Clancy's Pig,"' announced Zeusentell in a shrill, dry,
unnatural tone. And then he began in a rapid sing-song:</p>

<p>'"Patrick Clancy had a pig Th' pride uv all th' nation, The half
uv him was half as big As half uv all creation&mdash;"'</p>

<p>When he concluded the others looked at each other to convey
their appreciation. They then wildly clapped their hands or tinkled
their glasses. As Zeusentell went toward his seat a man leaned over
and asked:</p>

<p>'Can yeh tell me where I kin git that?'</p>

<p>He had made a great success. After an enormous pressure he was
induced to recite two more tales. Old Bleecker finally led him
forward and pledged him in a large drink. He declared that they
were the best things he had ever heard.</p>

<p>The efforts of Zeusentell imparted a gaiety to the company. The
men having laughed together were better acquainted, and there was
now a universal topic. Some of the party, too, began to be quite
drunk.</p>

<p>The invaluable O'Connor brought forth a man who could play the
mouth-organ. The latter, after wiping his instrument upon his
coat-sleeve, played all the popular airs. The men's heads swayed to
and fro in the clouded smoke. They grinned and beat time with their
feet. A valour, barbaric and wild, began to show in their poses and
in their faces, red and glistening from perspiration.</p>

<p>The conversation resounded in a hoarse roar. The beer would not
run rapidly enough for Jones; so he remained behind to tilt the
keg. This caused the black shadow on the wall to retreat and
advance, sinking mystically, to loom forward again with sudden
menace&mdash;a huge dark figure, controlled as by some unknown
emotion. The glasses, mugs, and cups travelled swift and regular,
catching orange reflections from the lamp-light. Two or three men
were grown so careless that they were continually spilling their
drinks. Old Bleecker, cackling with pleasure, seized time to glance
triumphantly at Jones. His party was going to be a success.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>IX.</h2>

<p>Of a sudden Kelcey felt the buoyant thought that he was having a
good time. He was all at once an enthusiast, as if he were at a
festival of a religion. He felt that there was something fine and
thrilling in this affair, isolated from a stern world, and from
which the laughter arose like incense. He knew that old sentiment
of brotherly regard for those about him. He began to converse
tenderly with them.</p>

<p>He was not sure of his drift of thought, but he knew that he was
immensely sympathetic. He rejoiced at their faces, shining red and
wrinkled with smiles. He was capable of heroisms.</p>

<p>His pipe irritated him by going out frequently. He was too busy
in amiable conversations to attend to it. When he arose to go for a
match he discovered that his legs were a trifle uncertain under
him. They bended, and did not precisely obey his intent.</p>

<p>At the table he lit a match, and then, in laughing at a joke
made near him, forgot to apply it to the bowl of his pipe. He
succeeded with the next match, after annoying trouble. He swayed so
that the match would appear first on one side of the bowl and then
on the other. At last he happily got it directly over the tobacco.
He had burned his fingers. He inspected them, laughing vaguely.</p>

<p>Jones came and slapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>'Well, ol' man, let's take a drink fer ol' Handyville's
sake!'</p>

<p>Kelcey was deeply affected. He looked at Jones with moist
eyes.</p>

<p>'I'll go yeh,' he said.</p>

<p>With an air of profound melancholy, Jones poured out some
whisky. They drank reverently. They exchanged a glistening look of
tender recollections, and then went over to where Bleecker was
telling a humorous story to a circle of giggling listeners. The old
man sat like a fat, jolly god.</p>

<p>'And just at that moment th' old woman put her head out of th'
window an' said: "Mike, yez lezy divil, fer phwat do yez be slapin'
in me new geranium bid?" An' Mike woke up an' said: "Domn a
wash-woman thot do niver wash her own bid-clues. Here do I be
slapin' in nothin' but dhirt an' wades."'</p>

<p>The men slapped their knees, roaring loudly. They begged him to
tell another. A clamour of comment arose concerning the anecdote,
so that when old Bleecker began a fresh one nobody was heeding.</p>

<p>It occurred to Jones to sing. Suddenly he burst forth with a
ballad that had a rippling waltz movement, and, seizing Kelcey,
made a furious attempt to dance. They sprawled over a pair of
outstretched legs and pitched headlong. Kelcey fell with a yellow
crash. Blinding lights flashed before his vision, but he arose
immediately, laughing. He did not feel at all hurt. The pain in his
head was rather pleasant.</p>

<p>Old Bleecker, O'Connor, and Jones, who now limped and drew
breath through his teeth, were about to lead him with much care and
tenderness to the table for another drink, but he laughingly pushed
them away and went unassisted. Bleecker told him: 'Great Gawd, your
head struck hard enough t' break a trunk.'</p>

<p>He laughed again, and with a show of steadiness and courage he
poured out an extravagant portion of whisky. With cold muscles he
put it to his lips and drank it. It chanced that this addition
dazed him like a powerful blow. A moment later it affected him,
with blinding and numbing power.</p>

<p>Suddenly unbalanced, he felt the room sway. His blurred sight
could only distinguish a tumbled mass of shadow through which the
beams from the light ran like swords of flame, The sound of the
many voices was to him like the roar of a distant river.</p>

<p>Still, he felt that if he could only annul the force of these
million winding figures that gripped his senses, he was capable of
most brilliant and entertaining things.</p>

<p>He was at first of the conviction that his feelings were only
temporary. He waited for them to pass away, but the mental and
physical pause only caused a new reeling and swinging of the room.
Chasms with inclined approaches were before him; peaks leaned
toward him. And withal he was blind and numb with surprise. He
understood vaguely in his stupefaction that it would disgrace him
to fall down a chasm.</p>

<p>At last he perceived a shadow, a form, which he knew to be
Jones. The adorable Jones, the supremely wise Jones, was walking in
this strange land without fear or care, erect and tranquil. Kelcey
murmured in admiration and affection, and fell toward his friend.
Jones's voice sounded as from the shores of the unknown.</p>

<p>'Come, come, of man, this will never do. Brace up.'</p>

<p>It appeared after all that Jones was not wholly wise.</p>

<p>'Oh, I'm&mdash;all ri', Jones! I'm all ri'! I wan' shing song! T
ha's all&mdash;I wan' shing song!'</p>

<p>Jones was stupid.</p>

<p>'Come, now, sit down an' shut up.'</p>

<p>It made Kelcey burn with fury.</p>

<p>'Jones, le' me alone, I tell yeh! Le' me alone! I wan' shing
song er te' story! G'l'm'n, I lovsh girl live down my shtreet.
Thash reason 'm drunk&mdash;'tis! She&mdash;'</p>

<p>Jones seized him and dragged him toward a chair. He heard him
laugh. He could not endure these insults from his friend. He felt a
blazing desire to strangle his companion.</p>

<p>He threw out his hand violently, but Jones grappled him close,
and he was no more than a dried leaf. He was amazed to find that
Jones possessed the strength of twenty horses. He was forced
skilfully to the floor.</p>

<p>As he lay he reflected in great astonishment upon Jones's
muscle. It was singular that he had never before discovered it. The
whole incident had impressed him immensely. An idea struck him that
he might denounce Jones for it. It would be a sage thing. There
would be a thrilling and dramatic moment in which he would dazzle
all the others.</p>

<p>But at this moment he was assailed by a mighty desire to sleep.
Sombre and soothing clouds of slumber were heavily upon him. He
closed his eyes with a sigh that was yet like that of a babe.</p>

<p>When he awoke there was still the battleful clamour of the
revel. He half arose, with a plan of participating, when O'Connor
came and pushed him down again, throwing out his chin in
affectionate remonstrance, and saying, 'Now, now!' as to a
child.</p>

<p>The change that had come over these men mystified Kelcey in a
great degree. He had never seen anything so vastly stupid as their
idea of his state. He resolved to prove to them that they were
dealing with one whose mind was very clear.</p>

<p>He kicked and squirmed in O'Connor's arms, until, with a final
wrench, he scrambled to his feet and stood tottering in the middle
of the room. He would let them see that he had a strangely lucid
grasp of events.</p>

<p>'G'l'm'n, I lovsh girl! I ain' drunker'n yeh all are!
She&mdash;'</p>

<p>He felt them hurl him to a corner of the room and pile chairs
and tables upon him until he was buried beneath a stupendous
mountain. Far above, as up a mine's shaft, there were voices,
lights, and vague figures. He was not hurt physically, but his
feelings were unutterably injured.</p>

<p>He, the brilliant, the good, the sympathetic, had been thrust
fiendishly from the party. They had had the comprehension of red
lobsters. It was an unspeakable barbarism. Tears welled piteously
from his eyes. He planned long diabolical explanations!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>X.</h2>

<p>At first the gray lights of dawn came timidly into the room,
remaining near the windows, afraid to approach certain sinister
corners. Finally, mellow streams of sunshine poured in, undraping
the shadows to disclose the putrefaction, making pitiless
revelation. Kelcey awoke with a groan of undirected misery. He
tossed his stiffened arms about his head for a moment, and then,
leaning heavily upon his elbow, stared blinking at his environment.
The grim truthfulness of the day showed disaster and death. After
the tumults of the previous night the interior of this room
resembled a decaying battlefield. The air hung heavy and stifling
with the odours of tobacco, men's breaths, and beer half filling
forgotten glasses. There was ruck of broken tumblers, pipes,
bottles, spilled tobacco, cigar stumps. The chairs and tables were
pitched this way and that way, as after some terrible struggle. In
the midst of it all lay old Bleecker, stretched upon a couch in
deepest sleep, as abandoned in attitude, as motionless, as ghastly,
as if it were a corpse that had been flung there.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the thing came gradually into Kelcey's eyes. He
looked about him with an expression of utter woe, regret, and
loathing. He was compelled to lie down again. A pain above his
eyebrows was like that from an iron clamp.</p>

<p>As he lay pondering, his bodily condition created for him a
bitter philosophy, and he perceived all the futility of a red
existence. He saw his life-problems confronting him like granite
giants, and he was no longer erect to meet them. He had made a
calamitous retrogression in his war. Spectres were to him now as
large as clouds.</p>

<p>Inspired by the pitiless ache in his head, he was prepared to
reform and live a white life. His stomach informed him that a good
man was the only being who was wise. But his perception of his
future was hopeless. He was aghast at the prospect of the old
routine. It was impossible. He trembled before its exactions.</p>

<p>Turning toward the other way, he saw that the gold portals of
vice no longer enticed him. He could not hear the strains of
alluring music. The beckoning sirens of drink had been killed by
this pain in his head. The desires of his life suddenly lay dead,
like mullein stalks. Upon reflection, he saw, therefore, that he
was perfectly willing to be virtuous if somebody would come and
make it easy for him.</p>

<p>When he stared over at old Bleecker, he felt a sudden contempt
and dislike for him. He considered him to be a tottering old beast.
It was disgusting to perceive aged men so weak in sin. He dreaded
to see him awaken, lest he should be required to be somewhat civil
to him.</p>

<p>Kelcey wished for a drink of water. For some time he had dreamed
of the liquid, deliciously cool. It was an abstract, uncontained
thing that poured upon him and tumbled him, taking away his pain
like a kind of surgery. He arose and staggered slowly toward a
little sink in a corner of the room. He understood that any rapid
movement might cause his head to split.</p>

<p>The little sink was filled with a chaos of broken glass and
spilled liquids. A sight of it filled him with horror, but he
rinsed a glass with scrupulous care, and, filling it, took an
enormous drink. The water was an intolerable disappointment. It was
insipid and weak to his scorched throat, and not at all cool. He
put down the glass with a gesture of despair. His face became fixed
in the stony and sullen expression of a man who waits for the
recuperative power of morrows.</p>

<p>Old Bleecker awakened. He rolled over and groaned loudly. For
awhile he thrashed about in a fury of displeasure at his bodily
stiffness and pain. Kelcey watched him as he would have watched a
death agony.</p>

<p>'Good Gawd!' said the old man, 'beer an' whisky make th' devil
of a mix! Did yeh see th' fight?'</p>

<p>'No,' said Kelcey stolidly.</p>

<p>'Why, Zeusentell an' O'Connor had a great old mill. They were
scrappin' all over th' place. I thought we were all goin' t' get
pulled. Thompson, that fellah over in th' corner, though, he sat
down on th' whole business. He was a dandy! He had t' poke
Zeusentell! He was a bird! Lord, I wish I had a Manhattan!'</p>

<p>Kelcey remained in bitter silence while old Bleecker dressed.
'Come an' get a cocktail,' said the latter briskly. This was part
of his aristocracy. He was the only man of them who knew much about
cocktails. He perpetually referred to them. 'It'll brace yeh right
up! Come along! Say, you get full too soon. You oughter wait until
later, me boy! You're too speedy!' Kelcey wondered vaguely where
his companion had lost his zeal for polished sentences, his
iridescent mannerisms.</p>

<p>'Come along,' said Bleecker.</p>

<p>Kelcey made a movement of disdain for cocktails, but he followed
the other to the street. At the corner they separated. Kelcey
attempted a friendly parting smile and then went on up the street.
He had to reflect to know that he was erect and using his own
muscles in walking. He felt like a man of paper, blown by the
winds. Withal, the dust of the avenue was galling to his throat,
eyes and nostrils, and the roar of traffic cracked his head. He was
glad, however, to be alone, to be rid of old Bleecker. The sight of
him had been as the contemplation of a disease.</p>

<p>His mother was not at home. In his little room he mechanically
undressed and bathed his head, arms and shoulders. When he crawled
between the two white sheets he felt a first lifting of his misery.
His pillow was soothingly soft. There was an effect that was like
the music of tender voices.</p>

<p>When he awoke again his mother was bending over him giving vent
to alternate cries of grief and joy. Her hands trembled so that
they were useless to her. 'Oh, George, George, where have yeh been?
What has happened t' yeh? Oh, George, I've been so worried! I
didn't sleep a wink all night!'</p>

<p>Kelcey was instantly wide awake. With a moan of suffering he
turned his face to the wall before he spoke. 'Never mind, mother,
I'm all right. Don't fret now! I was knocked down by a truck last
night in th' street, an' they took me t' th' hospital; but it's all
right now. I got out jest a little while ago. They told me I'd
better go home an' rest up.'</p>

<p>His mother screamed in pity, horror, joy and self-reproach for
something unknown. She frenziedly demanded the details. He sighed
with unutterable weariness. 'Oh&mdash;wait&mdash;wait&mdash;wait!'
he said, shutting his eyes as from the merciless monotony of a
pain. 'Wait&mdash;wait&mdash;please wait! I can't talk now. I want
t' rest.'</p>

<p>His mother condemned herself with a little cry. She adjusted his
pillow, her hands shaking with love and tenderness.</p>

<p>'There, there, don't mind, dearie! But yeh can't think how
worried I was&mdash;an' crazy. I was near frantic. I went down t'
th' shop, an' they said they hadn't seen anything 'a yeh there. The
foreman was awful good t' me. He said he'd come up this atternoon
t' see if yeh had come home yet. He tol' me not t' worry. Are yeh
sure yer all right? Ain't there anythin' I kin git fer yeh? What
did th' doctor say?'</p>

<p>Kelcey's patience was worn. He gestured, and then spoke
querulously. 'Now&mdash;now&mdash;mother, it's all right, I tell
yeh! All I need is a little rest, an' I'll be as well as ever. But
it makes it all th' worse if yeh stand there an' ask me questions
an' make me think. Jest leave me alone fer a little while, an' I'll
be as well as ever. Can't yeh do that?'</p>

<p>The little old woman puckered her lips funnily. 'My, what an old
bear th' boy is!' She kissed him blithely. Presently she went out,
upon her face a bright and glad smile that must have been a
reminiscence of some arming girlhood.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>XI.</h2>

<p>At one time Kelcey had a friend who was struck in the head by
the pole of a truck and knocked senseless. He was taken to the
hospital, from which he emerged in the morning an astonished man,
with rather a dim recollection of the accident. He used to hold an
old brierwood pipe in his teeth in a manner peculiar to himself,
and, with a brown derby hat tilted back on his head, recount his
strange sensations. Kelcey had always remembered it as a bit of
curious history. When his mother cross-examined him in regard to
the accident, he told this story with barely a variation. Its
truthfulness was incontestable.</p>

<p>At the shop he was welcomed on the following day with
considerable enthusiasm. The foreman had told the story, and there
were already jokes created concerning it. Mike O'Donnell, whose wit
was famous, had planned a humorous campaign, in which he made
charges against Kelcey which were, as a matter of fact, almost the
exact truth. Upon hearing it, Kelcey looked at him suddenly from
the corners of his eyes, but otherwise remained imperturbable.
O'Donnell eventually despaired. 'Yez can't goiy that kid! He tekes
ut all loike mate an' dhrink.' Kelcey often told the story, his
pipe held in his teeth peculiarly, and his derby tilted back on his
head.</p>

<p>He remained at home for several evenings, content to read the
papers and talk with his mother. She began to look around for the
tremendous reason for it. She suspected that his nearness to death
in the recent accident had sobered his senses and made him think of
high things. She mused upon it continually. When he sat moodily
pondering she watched him. She said to herself that she saw the
light breaking in upon his spirit. She felt that it was a very
critical period of his existence. She resolved to use all her power
and skill to turn his eyes toward the lights in the sky.
Accordingly, she addressed him one evening:</p>

<p>'Come, go t' prayer-meetin' t'-night with me, will yeh, George?'
It sounded more blunt than she intended.</p>

<p>He glanced at her in sudden surprise. 'Huh?'</p>

<p>As she repeated her request, her voice quavered. She felt that
it was a supreme moment.</p>

<p>'Come, go t' prayer-meetin' t'-night, won't yeh?'</p>

<p>He seemed amazed.</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't know,' he began. He was fumbling in his mind for a
reason for refusing. 'I don't wanta go. I'm tired as the
dickens!'</p>

<p>His obedient shoulders sank down languidly. His head mildly
drooped.</p>

<p>The little old woman, with a quick perception of her
helplessness, felt a motherly rage at her son. It was intolerable
that she could not impart motion to him in a chosen direction. The
waves of her desires were puny against the rocks of his indolence.
She had a great wish to beat him.</p>

<p>'I don't know what I'm ever goin' t' do with yeh,' she told him
in a choking voice. 'Yeh won't do anything I ask yeh to. Yeh never
pay th' least bit 'a attention t' what I say. Yeh don't mind me any
more than yeh would a fly. Whatever am I goin' t' do with yeh?'</p>

<p>She faced him in a battleful way, her eyes blazing with a sombre
light of despairing rage.</p>

<p>He looked up at her ironically. 'I don't know,' he said, with
calmness. 'What are yeh?' He had traced her emotions and seen her
fear of his rebellion. He thrust out his legs in the easy scorn of
a rapier-bravo. 'What are yeh?'</p>

<p>The little old woman began to weep. They were tears without a
shame of grief. She allowed them to run unheeded down her cheeks.
As she stared into space her son saw her regarding there the powers
and influences that she had held in her younger life. She was in
some way acknowledging to fate that she was now but withered grass,
with no power but the power to feel the winds. He was smitten with
a sudden shame. Besides, in the last few days he had gained quite a
character for amiability. He saw something grand in relenting at
this point. 'Well,' he said, trying to remove a sulky quality from
his voice, 'well, if yer bound t' have me go, I s'pose I'll have t'
go.'</p>

<p>His mother, with strange, immobile face, went to him and kissed
him on the brow. 'All right, George!' There was in her wet eyes an
emotion which he could not fathom.</p>

<p>She put on her bonnet and shawl, and they went out together. She
was unusually silent, and made him wonder why she did not appear
gleeful at his coming. He was resentful because she did not display
more appreciation of his sacrifice. Several times he thought of
halting and refusing to go further, to see if that would not wring
from her some acknowledgment.</p>

<p>In a dark street the little chapel sat humbly between two
towering apartment-houses. A red street-lamp stood in front. It
threw a. marvellous reflection upon the wet pavements. It was like
the death-stain of a spirit. Further up the brilliant lights of an
avenue made a span of gold across the black street. A roar of
wheels and a clang of bells came from this point, interwoven into a
sound emblematic of the life of the city. It seemed somehow to
affront this solemn and austere little edifice. It suggested an
approaching barbaric invasion. The little church, pierced, would
die with a fine, illimitable scorn for its slayers.</p>

<p>When Kelcey entered with his mother he felt a sudden quaking.
His knees shook. It was an awesome place to him. There was a menace
in the red padded carpet and the leather doors, studded with little
brass tacks that penetrated his soul with their pitiless glances.
As for his mother, she had acquired such a new air that he would
have been afraid to address her. He felt completely alone and
isolated at this formidable time.</p>

<p>There was a man in the vestibule who looked at them blandly.
From within came the sound of singing. To Kelcey there were a
million voices. He dreaded the terrible moment when the doors
should swing back. He wished to recoil, but at that instant the
bland man pushed the doors aside, and he followed his mother up the
centre aisle of the little chapel. To him there was a riot of
lights that made him transparent. The multitudinous pairs of eyes
that turned toward him were implacable in their cool
valuations.</p>

<p>They had just ceased singing. He who conducted the meeting
motioned that the service should wait until the new-comers found
seats. The little old woman went slowly on toward the first rows.
Occasionally she paused to scrutinize vacant places, but they did
not seem to meet her requirements. Kelcey was in agony. He thought
the moment of her decision would never come. In his unspeakable
haste he walked a little faster than his mother.</p>

<p>Once she paused to glance in her calculating way at some seats
and he forged ahead. He halted abruptly and returned, but by that
time she had resumed her thoughtful march up the aisle. He could
have assassinated her. He felt that everybody must have seen his
torture, during which his hands were to him like monstrous swollen
hides. He was wild with a rage in which his lips turned slightly
livid. He was capable of doing some furious, unholy thing.</p>

<p>When the little old woman at last took a seat, her son sat down
beside her slowly and stiffly. He was opposing his strong desire to
drop.</p>

<p>When from the mists of his shame and humiliation the scene came
before his vision, he was surprised to find that all eyes were not
fastened upon his face. The leader of the meeting seemed to be the
only one who saw him. He stared gravely, solemnly, regretfully. He
was a pale-faced but plump young man in a black coat that buttoned
to his chin. It was evident to Kelcey that his mother had spoken of
him to the young clergyman, and that the latter was now impressing
upon him the sorrow caused by the con- templation of his sin.
Kelcey hated the man.</p>

<p>A man seated alone over in a corner began to sing. He closed his
eyes and threw back his head. Others, scattered sparsely throughout
the innumerable light-wood chairs, joined him as they caught the
air.</p>

<p>Kelcey heard his mother's frail, squeaking soprano. The
chandelier in the centre was the only one lighted, and far at the
end of the room one could discern the pulpit swathed in gloom,
solemn and mystic as a bier. It was surrounded by vague shapes of
darkness on which at times was the glint of brass, or of glass that
shone like steel, until one could feel there the presence of the
army of the unknown, possessors of the great eternal truths, and
silent listeners at this ceremony. High up, the stained glass
windows loomed in leaden array like dull-hued banners, merely
catching occasional splashes of dark wine-colour from the lights.
Kelcey fell to brooding concerning this indefinable presence which
he felt in a church.</p>

<p>One by one people arose and told little tales of their religious
faith. Some were tearful, and others calm, emotionless, and
convincing.</p>

<p>Kelcey listened closely for a time. These people filled him with
a great curiosity. He was not familiar with their types.</p>

<p>At last the young clergyman spoke at some length.</p>

<p>Kelcey was amazed, because, from the young man's appearance, he
would not have suspected him of being so glib; but the speech had
no effect on Kelcey, excepting to prove to him again that he was
damned.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>XII.</h2>

<p>Kelcey sometimes wondered whether he liked beer. He had been
obliged to cultivate a talent for imbibing it. He was born with an
abhorrence which he had steadily battled until it had come to pass
that he could drink from ten to twenty glasses of beer without the
act of swallowing causing him to shiver. He understood that drink
was an essential to joy, to the coveted position of a man of the
world and of the streets. The saloons contained the mystery of a
street for him. When he knew its saloons he comprehended the
street.</p>

<p>Drink and its surroundings were the eyes of a superb green
dragon to him. He followed a fascinating glitter, and the glitter
required no explanation.</p>

<p>Directly after old Bleecker's party he almost reformed. He was
tired and worn from the tumult of it, and he saw it as one might
see a skeleton emerged from a crimson cloak. He wished then to turn
his face away.</p>

<p>Gradually, however, he recovered his mental balance. Then he
admitted again by his point of view that the thing was not so
terrible. His headache had caused him to exaggerate. A 'drunk' was
not the blight which he had once remorsefully named it. On the
contrary, it was a mere unpleasant incident. He resolved, however,
to be more cautious.</p>

<p>When prayer-meeting night came again his mother approached him
hopefully. She smiled like one whose request is already
granted.</p>

<p>'Well, will yeh go t' prayer-meetin' with me t'-night
again?'</p>

<p>He turned toward her with eloquent suddenness, and then riveted
his eyes upon a corner of the floor.</p>

<p>'Well, I guess not,' he said.</p>

<p>His mother tearfully tried to comprehend his state of mind.</p>

<p>'What has come over yeh?' she said tremblingly. 'Yeh never used
t' be this way, George. Yeh never used t' be so cross an' mean t'
me&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, I ain't cross an' mean t' yeh,' he interpolated,
exasperated and violent.</p>

<p>'Yes, yeh are, too! I ain't hardly had a decent word from yeh in
ever so long. Yer as cross an' as mean as yeh can be. I don't know
what t' make of it. It can't be'&mdash;there came a look in her
eyes that told that she was going to shock and alarm him with her
heaviest sentence&mdash;'it can't be that yeh've got t'
drinkin'.'</p>

<p>Kelcey grunted with disgust at the ridiculous thing. 'Why, what
an old goose yer gettin' t' be!'</p>

<p>She was compelled to laugh a little, as a child laughs between
tears at a hurt. She had not been serious. She was only trying to
display to him how she regarded his horrifying mental state. 'Oh,
of course I didn't mean that, but I think yeh act jest as bad as if
yeh did drink. I wish yeh would do better, George!'</p>

<p>She had grown so much less frigid and stern in her censure that
Kelcey seized the opportunity to try to make a joke of it. He
laughed at her, but she shook her head and continued: 'I do wish
yeh would do better. I don't know what's t' become 'a yeh, George.
Yeh don't mind what I say no more'n if I was th' wind in th'
chimbly. Yeh don't care about nothin' 'cept goin out nights. I
can't ever get yeh t' prayermeetin' ner church; yeh never go out
with me anywheres unless yeh can't get out of it; yeh swear an'
take on sometimes like everything; yeh never&mdash;'</p>

<p>He gestured wrathfully in interruption. 'Say, lookahere, can't
yeh think 'a something I do?'</p>

<p>She ended her oration then in the old way&mdash;'An' I don't
know what's goin' t' become 'a yeh.'</p>

<p>She put on her bonnet and shawl and then came and stood near him
expectantly. She imparted to her attitude a subtle threat of
unchangeableness. He pretended to be engrossed in his newspaper.
The little swaggering clock on the mantel became suddenly evident,
ticking with loud monotony. Presently she said firmly, 'Well, are
yeh comin'?'</p>

<p>He was reading.</p>

<p>'Well, are yeh comin'?'</p>

<p>He threw his paper down angrily. 'Oh, why don't yeh go on an'
leave me alone?' he demanded in supreme impatience. 'What do yeh
wanta pester me fer? Ye'd think there was robbers. Why can't yeh go
alone or else stay home? You wanta go, an' I don't wanta go, an'
yeh keep all time tryin' t' drag me. Yeh know I don't wanta go.' He
concluded in a last defiant wounding of her. 'What do I care 'bout
those of bags-'a-wind, anyhow? They gimme a pain!'</p>

<p>His mother turned her face and went from him. He sat staring
with a mechanical frown. Presently he went and picked up his
newspaper.</p>

<p>Jones told him that night that everybody had had such a good
time at old Bleecker's party that they were going to form a club.
They waited at the little smiling saloon, and then, amid much
enthusiasm, all signed a membership-roll. Old Bleecker, late that
night, was violently elected president. He made speeches of thanks
and gratification during the remainder of the meeting. Kelcey went
home rejoicing. He felt that at any rate he would have true
friends. The dues were a dollar for each week.</p>

<p>He was deeply interested. For a number of evenings he fairly
gobbled his supper in order that he might be off to the little
smiling saloon to discuss the new organization. All the men were
wildly enthusiastic. One night the saloon-keeper announced that he
would donate half the rent of quite a large room over his saloon.
It was an occasion for great cheering. Kelcey's legs were like
whalebone when he tried to go upstairs upon his return home, and
the edge of each step was moved curiously forward.</p>

<p>His mother's questions made him snarl. 'Oh, nowheres!' At other
times he would tell her, 'Oh, t' see some friends 'a mine! Where d'
yeh s'pose?'</p>

<p>Finally, some of the women of the tenement concluded that the
little old mother had a wild son. They came to condole with her.
They sat in the kitchen for hours. She told them of his wit, his
cleverness, his kind heart.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>XIII.</h2>

<p>At a certain time Kelcey discovered that some young men who
stood in the cinders between a brick wall and the pavement, and
near the side-door of a corner saloon, knew more about life than
other people. They used to lean there smoking and chewing, and
comment upon events and persons. They knew the neighbourhood
extremely well. They debated upon small typical things that
transpired before them, until they had extracted all the
information that existence contained. They sometimes inaugurated
little fights with foreigners or well-dressed men. It was here that
Sapristi Glielmi, the pedlar, stabbed Pete Brady to death, for
which he got a life-sentence. Each patron of the saloon was closely
scrutinized as he entered the place.</p>

<p>Sometimes they used to throng upon the heels of a man, and in at
the bar assert that he had asked them in to drink. When he
objected, they would claim with one voice that it was too deep an
insult, and gather about to thrash him. When they had caught chance
customers and absolute strangers, the barkeeper had remained in
stolid neutrality, ready to serve one or seven, but two or three
times they had encountered the wrong men. Finally, the proprietor
had come out one morning and told them in the fearless way of his
class that their pastime must cease.</p>

<p>'It quits right here! See? Right here! Th' nex' time yeh try t'
work it, I come with th' bung-starter, an' th' mugs I miss with it
git pulled. See? It quits!' Infrequently, however, men did ask them
in to drink.</p>

<p>The policeman of that beat grew dignified and shrewd whenever he
approached this corner. Sometimes he stood with his hands behind
his back and cautiously conversed with them. It was understood on
both sides that it was a good thing to be civil.</p>

<p>In winter this band, a trifle diminished in numbers, huddled in
their old coats and stamped little flat places in the snow, their
faces turned always toward the changing life in the streets. In the
summer they became more lively. Sometimes, then, they walked out to
the kerb to look up and down the street.</p>

<p>Over in a trampled vacant lot, surrounded by high
tenement-houses, there was a sort of a den among some boulders. An
old truck was made to form a shelter. The small hoodlums of that
vicinity all avoided the spot&mdash;so many of them had been
thrashed upon being caught near it. It was the summer-time lounging
place of the band from the corner.</p>

<p>They were all too clever to work. Some of them had worked, but
these used their experiences as stores from which to draw tales.
They were like veterans with their wars. One lad in particular used
to recount how he whipped his employer, proprietor of a large grain
and feed establishment. He described his victim's features and form
and clothes with minute exactness. He bragged of his wealth and
social position. It had been a proud moment of the lad's life. He
was like a savage who had killed a great chief.</p>

<p>Their feeling for contemporaneous life was one of contempt.
Their philosophy taught that in a large part the whole thing was
idle and a great bore. With fine scorn they sneered at the futility
of it. Work was done by men who had not the courage to stand still
and let the skies clap together if they willed.</p>

<p>The vast machinery of the popular law indicated to them that
there were people in the world who wished to remain quiet. They
awaited the moment when they could prove to them that a riotous
upheaval, a cloud-burst of destruction, would be a delicious thing.
They thought of their fingers buried in the lives of these people.
They longed dimly for a time when they could run through decorous
streets with crash and roar of war, an army of revenge for
pleasures long possessed by others, a wild sweeping compensation
for their years without crystal and gilt, women and wine. This
thought slumbered in them, as the image of Rome might have lain
small in the hearts of the barbarians.</p>

<p>Kelcey respected these youths so much that he ordinarily used
the other side of the street. He could not go near to them, because
if a passer minded his own business he was a disdainful prig and
had insulted them; if he showed that he was aware of them they were
likely to resent his not minding his own business and prod him into
a fight if the opportunity were good. Kelcey longed for their
acquaintance and friendship, for with it came social safety and
ease; they were respected so universally.</p>

<p>Once, in another street, Fidsey Corcoran was whipped by a short,
heavy man. Fidsey picked himself up, and in the fury of defeat
hurled pieces of brick at his opponent. The short man dodged with
skill, and then pursued Fidsey for over a block. Sometimes he got
near enough to punch him. Fidsey raved in maniacal fury. The moment
the short man would attempt to resume his own affairs, Fidsey would
turn upon him again, tears and blood upon his face, with the lashed
rage of a vanquished animal. The short man used to turn about,
swear madly, and make little dashes. Fidsey always ran, and then
returned as pursuit ceased.</p>

<p>The short man apparently wondered if this maniac was ever going
to allow him to finish whipping him. He looked helplessly up and
down the street. People were there who knew Fidsey, and they
remonstrated with him; but he continued to confront the short man,
gibbering like a wounded ape, using all the eloquence of the street
in his wild oaths.</p>

<p>Finally, the short man was exasperated to black fury. He decided
to end the fight. With low snarls, ominous as death, he plunged at
Fidsey.</p>

<p>Kelcey happened there then. He grasped the short man's shoulder.
He cried out, in the peculiar whine of the man who interferes:</p>

<p>'Oh, hol' on! Yeh don't wanta hit 'im any more! Yeh've done
enough to 'im now! Leave 'im be!'</p>

<p>The short man wrenched and tugged. He turned his face until his
teeth were almost at Kelcey's cheek.</p>

<p>'Le' go me! Le' go me, you&mdash;'</p>

<p>The rest of his sentence was screamed curses.</p>

<p>Kelcey's face grew livid from fear, but he somehow managed to
keep his grip. Fidsey, with but an instant's pause, plunged into
the new fray.</p>

<p>They beat the short man. They forced him against a high
board-fence, where for a few seconds their blows sounded upon his
head in swift thuds. A moment later Fidsey descried a running
policeman. He made off, fleet as a shadow. Kelcey noted his going.
He ran after him.</p>

<p>Three or four blocks away they halted. Fidsey said:</p>

<p>'I'd 'a licked dat big stuff in 'bout a minute more,' and wiped
the blood from his eyes.</p>

<p>At the gang's corner they asked: 'Who soaked yeh, Fidsey?' His
description was burning. Everybody laughed. 'Where is 'e now?'</p>

<p>Later they began to question Kelcey. He recited a tale in which
he allowed himself to appear prominent and redoubtable. They looked
at him then as if they thought he might be quite a man.</p>

<p>Once when the little old woman was going out to buy something
for her son's supper, she discovered him standing at the side-door
of the saloon engaged intimately with Fidsey and the others. She
slunk away, for she understood that it would be a terrible thing to
confront him and his pride there with youths who were superior to
mothers.</p>

<p>When he arrived home, he threw down his hat with a weary sigh,
as if he had worked long hours, but she attacked him before he had
time to complete the falsehood. He listened to her harangue with a
curled lip. In defence he merely made a gesture of supreme
exasperation. She never understood the advanced things in life. He
felt the hopelessness of ever making her comprehend. His mother was
not modern.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>XIV.</h2>

<p>The little old woman arose early and bustled in the preparation
of breakfast. At times she looked anxiously at the clock. An hour
before her son should leave for work she went to his room, and
called him in the usual tone of sharpness:</p>

<p>'George! George!'</p>

<p>A sleepy growl came to her.</p>

<p>'Come, come, it's time t' git up,' she continued. 'Come, now,
git right up!' Later she went again to the door.</p>

<p>'George, are yeh gittin' up?'</p>

<p>'Huh?'</p>

<p>'Are yeh gittin' up?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I'll git right up!'</p>

<p>He had introduced a valour into his voice which she detected to
be false. She went to his bedside and took him by the shoulder.</p>

<p>'George&mdash;George&mdash;git up!'</p>

<p>From the mist-lands of sleep he began to protest incoherently.
'Oh le' me be, won' yeh? 'M sleepy!'</p>

<p>She continued to shake him. 'Well, it's time t' git up.
Come&mdash;come&mdash;come on, now!'</p>

<p>Her voice, shrill with annoyance, pierced his ears in a slender,
piping thread of sound. He turned over on the pillow to bury his
head in his arms. When he expostulated, his tones came
half-smothered.</p>

<p>'Oh, le' me be, can't yeh? There's plenty 'a time! Jest fer ten
minutes! 'M sleepy!'</p>

<p>She was implacable. 'No, yeh must git up now! Yeh ain't got
more'n time enough t' eat yer breakfast an' git t' work.'</p>

<p>Eventually he arose, sullen and grumbling. Later he came to his
breakfast, blinking his dry eyelids, his stiffened features set in
a mechanical scowl.</p>

<p>Each morning his mother went to his room, and fought a battle to
arouse him. She was like a soldier. Despite his pleadings, his
threats, she remained at her post, imperturbable and
unyielding.</p>

<p>These affairs assumed large proportions in his life. Sometimes
he grew beside himself with a bland, unformulated wrath. The whole
thing was a consummate imposition. He felt that he was being
cheated of his sleep. It was an injustice to compel him to arise
morning after morning with bitter regularity, before the sleep-gods
had at all loosened their grasp. He hated that unknown force which
directed his life.</p>

<p>One morning he swore a tangled mass of oaths, aimed into the
air, as if the injustice poised there. His mother flinched at
first; then her mouth set in the little straight line. She saw that
the momentous occasion had come. It was the time of the critical
battle. She turned upon him valorously.</p>

<p>'Stop your swearin', George Kelcey; I won't have yeh talk so
before me! I won't have it! Stop this minute! Not another word! Do
yeh think I'll allow yeh t' swear b'fore me like that? Not another
word! I won't have it! I declare I won't have it another
minute!'</p>

<p>At first her projected words had slid from his mind as if
striking against ice, but at last he heeded her. His face grew sour
with passion and misery&mdash;he spoke in tones dark with
dislike.</p>

<p>'Th' 'ell yeh won't? Whatter yeh goin' t' do 'bout it?' Then, as
if he considered that he had not been sufficiently impressive, he
arose and slowly walked over to her. Having arrived at point-blank
range he spoke again. 'Whatter yeh goin' t' do 'bout it?' He
regarded her then with an unaltering scowl, albeit his mien was as
dark and cowering as that of a condemned criminal.</p>

<p>She threw out her hands in the gesture of an impotent one. He
was acknowledged victor. He took his hat and slowly left her.</p>

<p>For three days they lived in silence. He brooded upon his
mother's agony and felt a singular joy in it. As opportunity
offered, he did little despicable things. He was going to make her
abject. He was now uncontrolled, ungoverned; he wished to be an
emperor. Her suffering was all a sort of compensation for his own
dire pains.</p>

<p>She went about with a gray, impassive face. It was as if she had
survived a massacre in which all that she loved had been torn from
her by the brutality of savages.</p>

<p>One evening at six he entered and stood looking at his mother as
she peeled potatoes. She had hearkened to his coming listlessly,
without emotion, and at his entrance she did not raise her
eyes.</p>

<p>'Well, I'm fired!' he said suddenly.</p>

<p>It seemed to be the final blow. Her body gave a convulsive
movement in the chair. When she finally lifted her eyes, horror
possessed her face. Her underjaw had fallen. 'Fired? Outa work?
Why&mdash;George?'</p>

<p>He went over to the window and stood with his back to her. He
could feel her gray stare upon him.</p>

<p>'Yes! Fired!'</p>

<p>At last she said:</p>

<p>'Well, whatter yeh goin' t' do?'</p>

<p>He tapped the pane with his finger-nail.</p>

<p>He answered in a tone made hoarse and unnatural by an assumption
of gay carelessness:</p>

<p>'Oh, nothin'!'</p>

<p>She began, then, her first weeping.
'Oh&mdash;George&mdash;George&mdash;George&mdash;'</p>

<p>He looked at her, scowling.</p>

<p>'Ah, whatter yeh givin' us? Is this all I git when I come home
f'm being fired? Anybody 'ud think it was my fault. I couldn't help
it.'</p>

<p>She continued to sob in a dull, shaking way. In the pose of her
head there was an expression of her conviction that comprehension
of her pain was impossible to the universe.</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, and then, with his usual tactics, went
out, slamming the door. A pale flood of sunlight, imperturbable at
its vocation, streamed upon the little old woman, bowed with pain,
forlorn in her chair.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>XV.</h2>

<p>Kelcey was standing on the corner next day when three little
boys came running. Two halted some distance away, and the other
came forward.</p>

<p>He halted before Kelcey, and spoke importantly.</p>

<p>'Hey, your ol' woman's sick.'</p>

<p>'What?'</p>

<p>'Your ol' woman's sick.'</p>

<p>'Git out!'</p>

<p>'She is, too!'</p>

<p>'Who tol' yeh?'</p>

<p>'Mis' Callahan. She said fer me t' run an' tell yeh. Dey want
yeh.'</p>

<p>A swift dread struck Kelcey. Like flashes of light little scenes
from the past shot through his brain. He had thoughts of a
vengeance from the clouds.</p>

<p>As he glanced about him the familiar view assumed a meaning that
was ominous and dark. There was prophecy of disaster in the street,
the buildings, the sky, the people. Something tragic and terrible
in the air was known to his nervous, quivering nostrils. He spoke
to the little boy in a tone that quavered.</p>

<p>'All right!'</p>

<p>Behind him he felt the sudden contemplative pause of his
companions of the gang. They were watching him. As he went rapidly
up the street he knew that they had come out to the middle of the
walk and were staring after him. He was glad that they could not
see his face, his trembling lips, his eyes quavering in fear.</p>

<p>He stopped at the door of his home and stared at the panel as if
he saw written thereon a word. A moment later he entered. His eye
comprehended the room in a frightened glance.</p>

<p>His mother sat gazing out at the opposite walls and windows. She
was leaning her head upon the back of the chair. Her face was
overspread with a singular pallor, but the glance of her eyes was
strong, and the set of her lips was tranquil.</p>

<p>He felt an unspeakable thrill of thanksgiving at seeing her
seated there calmly.</p>

<p>'Why, mother, they said yeh was sick,' he cried, going toward
her impetuously. 'What's th' matter?'</p>

<p>She smiled at him.</p>

<p>'Oh, it ain't nothin'! I on'y got kinda dizzy, that's all.'</p>

<p>Her voice was sober, and had the ring of vitality in it.</p>

<p>He noted her commonplace air. There was no alarm or pain in her
tones, but the misgivings of the street, the prophetic twinges of
his nerves, made him still hesitate.</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;are you sure it ain't? They scared me 'bout t'
death.'</p>

<p>'No, it ain't anything, o'ny some sorta dizzy feelin'. I fell
down b'hind th' stove. Missis Calahan, she came an' picked me up. I
must 'a laid there fer quite a while. Th' doctor said he guessed
I'd be all right in a couple 'a hours. I don't feel nothin'!'</p>

<p>Kelcey heaved a great sigh of relief.</p>

<p>'Lord, I was scared!' He began to beam joyously, since he was
escaped from his fright. 'Why, I couldn't think what had happened,'
he told her.</p>

<p>'Well, it ain't nothin',' she said.</p>

<p>He stood about awkwardly, keeping his eyes fastened upon her in
a sort of surprise, as if he had expected to discover that she had
vanished. The reaction from his panic was a thrill of delicious
contentment. He took a chair and sat down near her, but presently
he jumped up to ask:</p>

<p>'There ain't nothin' I can get for yeh, is ther?'</p>

<p>He looked at her eagerly. In his eyes shone love and joy. If it
were not for the shame of it, he would have called her endearing
names.</p>

<p>'No, ther ain't nothin',' she answered. Presently she continued,
in a conversational way: 'Yeh ain't found no work yit, have
yeh?'</p>

<p>The shadow of his past fell upon him then, and he became
suddenly morose. At last he spoke in a sentence that was a vow, a
declaration of change.</p>

<p>'No, I ain't, but I'm going t' hunt fer it hard, you bet.'</p>

<p>She understood from his tone that he was making peace with her.
She smiled at him gladly.</p>

<p>'Yer a good boy, George!' A rediance from the stars lit her
face.</p>

<p>Presently she asked:</p>

<p>'D' yeh think yer old boss would take yeh on ag'in if I went t'
see him?'</p>

<p>'No,' said Kelcey at once. 'It wouldn't do no good! They got all
th' men they want. There ain't no room there. It wouldn't do no
good.' He ceased to beam for a moment as he thought of certain
disclosures. 'I'm goin' t' try to git work everywheres. I'm going
t' make a wild break t' get a job, an' if there's one anywheres
I'll get it.'</p>

<p>She smiled at him again.</p>

<p>'That's right, George!'</p>

<p>When it came supper-time he dragged her in her chair over to the
table, and then scurried to and fro to prepare a meal for her. She
laughed gleefully at him. He was awkward and densely ignorant. He
exaggerated his helplessness sometimes until she was obliged to
lean back in her chair to laugh. Afterward they sat by the window.
Her hand rested upon his hair.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>XVI.</h2>

<p>When Kelcey went to borrow money from old Bleecker, Jones and
the others, he discovered that he was below them in social
position. Old Bleecker said gloomily that he did not see how he
could loan money at that time. When Jones asked him to have a
drink, his tone was careless.</p>

<p>O'Connor recited at length some bewildering financial troubles
of his own. In them all he saw that something had been reversed.
They remained silent upon many occasions when they might have
grunted in sympathy for him.</p>

<p>As he passed along the street near his home he perceived Fidsey
Corcoran and another of the gang. They made eloquent signs.</p>

<p>'Are yeh wid us?'</p>

<p>He stopped and looked at them.</p>

<p>'What's wrong with yeh?'</p>

<p>'Are yeh wid us er not?' demanded Fidsey. 'New barkeep'! Big
can! We got it over in d' lot. Big can, I tell yeh.'</p>

<p>He drew a picture in the air, so to speak, with his enthusiastic
fingers.</p>

<p>Kelcey turned dejectedly homeward.</p>

<p>'Oh, I guess not, this roun'.'</p>

<p>'What's d' matter wi'che?' said Fidsey. Yer gittin' t' be a
reg'lar willie! Come ahn, I tell yeh! Youse gits one smoke at d'
can b'cause yeh b'longs t' d' gang, an' yeh don't wanta give it up
widout er scrap! See? Some udder john 'll get yer smoke. Come
ahn!'</p>

<p>When they arrived at the place among the boulders in the vacant
lot, one of the band had a huge and battered tin can tilted afar
up. His throat worked convulsively. He was watched keenly and
anxiously by five or six others. Their eyes followed carefully each
fraction of distance that the can was lifted. They were very
silent.</p>

<p>Fidsey burst out violently as he perceived what was in
progress:</p>

<p>'Heh, Tim, yeh big sojer, let go d' can! What 'a yeh tink! Wese
er in dis! Le' go dat!'</p>

<p>He who was drinking made several angry protesting contortions of
his throat. Then he put down the can and swore.</p>

<p>'Who's a big sojer? I ain't gittin' more'n me own smoke! Yer too
bloomin' swift I Ye'd tink yeh was d' on'y mug what owned dis can!
Close yer face while I gits me smoke!'</p>

<p>He took breath for a moment, and then returned the can to its
tilted position.</p>

<p>Fidsey went to him and worried and clamoured. He interfered so
seriously with the action of drinking that the other was obliged to
release the can again for fear of choking.</p>

<p>Fidsey grabbed it, and glanced swiftly at the contents.</p>

<p>'Dere! Dat's what I was hollerin' at! Lookut d' beer! Not 'nough
t' wet yer t'roat! Yehs can't have notin' on d' level wid youse
damn' tanks! Youse was a reg'lar resevoiy, Tim Connigan! Look what

Willies? Don' we want no smoke? Say, lookut dat can! It's drier'n
hell! What 'a yeh tink?'</p>

<p>Tim glanced in at the beer. Then he said:</p>

<p>'Well, d' mug what come b'fore me, he on'y lef' me dat much.
Blue Billie, he done d' swallerin'! I on'y had a tas'e!'</p>

<p>Blue Billie, from his seat near, called out in wrathful
protest:</p>

<p>'Yeh lie, Tim. I never had more'n a mouf-ful!' An inspiration
evidently came to him then, for his countenance suddenly
brightened, and, arising, he went toward the can. 'I ain't had me
reg'lar smoke yit! Guess I come in aheader Fidsey, don t I?'</p>

<p>Fidsey, with a sardonic smile, swung the can behind him.</p>

<p>'I guess nit! Not dis minnet! Youse hadger smoke. If yeh ain't,
yeh don't git none. See?'</p>

<p>Blue Billie confronted Fidsey determinedly.</p>

<p>'D' 'ell I don't!'</p>

<p>'Nit,' said Fidsey.</p>

<p>Billie sat down again.</p>

<p>Fidsey drank his portion. Then he manoeuvred skilfully before
the crowd until Kelcey and the other youth took their shares.</p>

<p>'Youse er a mob 'a tanks,' he told the gang. 'Nobody 'ud git
not'in' if dey wasn't on t' yehs!'</p>

<p>Blue Billie's soul had been smouldering in hate against
Fidsey.</p>

<p>'Ah, shut up! Youse ain't gota take care 'a dose two mugs,
dough. Youse badger smoke, ain't yeh? Den yer tr'u. G' home!'</p>

<p>'Well, I hate t' see er bloke use 'imself for a tank,' said
Fidsey. 'But youse don't wanta go jollyin' 'round 'bout d' can,
Blue, er youse'll git done.'</p>

<p>'Who'll do me?' demanded Blue Billie, casting his eye about
him.</p>

<p>'Kel' will,' said Fidsey bravely.</p>

<p>'D' 'el he will!'</p>

<p>'Dat's what he will!'</p>

<p>Blue Billie made the gesture of a warrior.</p>

<p>'He never saw d' day 'a his life dat he could do me little
finger. If 'e says much t' me, I'll push 'is face all over d'
lot.'</p>

<p>Fidsey called to Kelcey.</p>

<p>'Say, Kel, hear what dis mug is chewin'?'</p>

<p>Kelcey was apparently deep in other matters. His back was
half-turned.</p>

<p>Blue Billie spoke to Fidsey in a battleful voice.</p>

<p>'Did 'e ever say 'e could do me?'</p>

<p>Fidsey said:</p>

<p>'Soitenly 'e did. Youse is dead easy, 'e says. He says he kin
punch holes in you, Blue!'</p>

<p>'When did 'e say it?'</p>

<p>'Oh&mdash;any time. Youse is a cinch, Kel' says.'</p>

<p>Blue Billie walked over to Kelcey. The others of the band
followed him, exchanging joyful glances.</p>

<p>'Did youse say yeh could do me?'</p>

<p>Kelcey slowly turned, but he kept his eyes upon the ground. He
heard Fidsey darting among the others, telling of his prowess,
preparing them for the downfall of Blue Billie. He stood heavily on
one foot and moved his hands nervously. Finally he said in a low
growl: 'Well, what if I did?'</p>

<p>The sentence sent a happy thrill through the band. It was a
formidable question. Blue Billie braced himself. Upon him came the
responsibility of the next step. The gang fell back a little upon
all sides. They looked expectantly at Blue Billie.</p>

<p>He walked forward with a deliberate step until his face was
close to Kelcey.</p>

<p>'Well, if you did,' he said, with a snarl between his teeth,
'I'm goin' t' t'ump d' life outa yeh right heh!'</p>

<p>A little boy, wild of eye and puffing, came down the slope as
from an explosion. He burst out in a rapid treble:</p>

<p>'Is dat Kelcey feller here? Say, yeh ol' woman's sick again. Dey
want yeh! Yeh's better run! She's awful sick!'</p>

<p>The gang turned with loud growls. 'Ah, git outa here!' Fidsey
threw a stone at the little boy and chased him a short distance,
but he continued to clamour:</p>

<p>'Youse better come, Kelcey feller! She's awful sick! She was
hollerin'! Dey been lookin' for yeh over'n hour!'</p>

<p>In his eagerness he returned part way, regardless of Fidsey.</p>

<p>Kelcey had moved away from Blue Billie. He said:</p>

<p>'I guess I'd better go.' They howled at him. 'Well,' he
continued, 'I can't&mdash;I don't wanta&mdash;I don't wanta leave
me mother be&mdash;she&mdash;'</p>

<p>His words were drowned in the chorus of their derision. 'Well,
looka-here,' he would begin, and at each time their cries and
screams ascended. They dragged at Blue Billie. 'Go for 'im, Blue!
Slug 'im! Go ahn!'</p>

<p>Kelcey went slowly away while they were urging Blue Billie to do
a decisive thing.</p>

<p>Billie stood fuming and blustering and explaining himself. When
Kelcey had achieved a considerable distance from him, he stepped
forward a few paces and hurled a terrible oath. Kelcey looked back
darkly.</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>XVII.</h2>

<p>When he entered the chamber of death he was brooding over the
recent encounter and devising extravagant revenges upon Blue Billie
and the others.</p>

<p>The little old woman was stretched upon her bed. Her face and
hands were of the hue of the blankets. Her hair, seemingly of a new
and wondrous grayness, hung over her temples in whips and tangles.
She was sickeningly motionless, save for her eyes, which rolled and
swayed in maniacal glances.</p>

<p>A young doctor had just been administering medicine.</p>

<p>'There,' he said, with a great satisfaction, 'I guess that'll do
her good!' As he went briskly towards the door he met Kelcey. 'Oh,'
he said. 'Son?'</p>

<p>Kelcey had that in his throat which was like fur. When he forced
his voice the words came first low and then high, as if they had
broken through something.</p>

<p>'Will she&mdash;will she&mdash;'</p>

<p>The doctor glanced back at the bed. She was watching them as she
would have watched ghouls, and muttering.</p>

<p>'Can't tell,' he said. 'She's a wonderful woman! Got more
vitality than you and I together! Can't tell! May&mdash;may not!
Good-day! Back in two hours.'</p>

<p>In the kitchen Mrs. Calahan was feverishly dusting the
furniture, polishing this and that. She arranged everything in
decorous rows. She was preparing for the coming of death. She
looked at the floor as if she longed to scrub it.</p>

<p>The doctor paused to speak in an undertone to her, glancing at
the bed. When he departed she laboured with a renewed speed.</p>

<p>Kelcey approached his mother. From a little distance he called
to her: 'Mother&mdash;mother&mdash;' He proceeded with caution lest
this mystic being upon the bed should clutch at him.
'Mother&mdash;mother&mdash;don't yeh know me?' He put forth
apprehensive, shaking fingers and touched her hand.</p>

<p>There were two brilliant steel-coloured points upon her
eyeballs. She was staring off at something sinister.</p>

<p>Suddenly she turned to her son in a wild babbling appeal:</p>

<p>'Help me! Help me! Oh, help me! I see them coming.'</p>

<p>Kelcey called to her as to a distant place. 'Mother! Mother!'
She looked at him, and then there began within her a struggle to
reach him with her mind. She fought with some implacable power
whose fingers were in her brain. She called to Kelcey in
stammering, incoherent cries for help. Then she again looked
away.</p>

<p>'Ah, there they come! There they come! Ah,
look&mdash;look&mdash;loo&mdash;' She arose to a sitting posture
without the use of her arms.</p>

<p>Kelcey felt himself being choked. When her voice pealed forth in
a scream he saw crimson curtains moving before his eyes.</p>

<p>'Mother&mdash;oh, mother&mdash;there's nothin'&mdash;there's
nothin'&mdash;'</p>

<p>She was at a kitchen-door with a dishcloth in her hand. Within
there had just been a clatter of crockery. Down through the trees
of the orchard she could see a man in a field ploughing.</p>

<p>'Bill&mdash;o-o-oh, Bill&mdash;have yeh seen Georgie? Is he out
there with you? Georgie! Georgie! Come right here this minnet!
Right&mdash;this&mdash;minnet!'</p>

<p>She began to talk to some people in the room:</p>

<p>'I want t' know what yeh want here! I want yeh t' git out! I
don't want yeh here! I don't feel good t'-day, an' I don't want yeh
here! I don't feel good t'-day! I want yeh t' git out!' Her voice
became peevish. 'Go away! Go away! Go away!'</p>

<p>Kelcey lay in a chair. His nerveless arms allowed his fingers to
sweep the floor. He became so that he could not hear the chatter
from the bed, but he was always conscious of the ticking of the
little clock out on the kitchen shelf.</p>

<p>When he aroused, the pale-faced but plump young clergyman was
before him.</p>

<p>'My poor lad!' began this latter.</p>

<p>The little old woman lay still with her eyes closed. On the
table at the head of the bed was a glass containing a water-like
medicine. The reflected lights made a silver star on its side. The
two men sat side by side, waiting. Out in the kitchen Mrs. Calahan
had taken a chair by the stove and was waiting.</p>

<p>Kelcey began to stare at the wall-paper. The pattern was
clusters of brown roses. He felt them like hideous crabs crawling
upon his brain.</p>

<p>Through the doorway he saw the oilcloth covering of the table
catching a glimmer from the warm afternoon sun. The window
disclosed a fair, soft sky, like blue enamel, and a fringe of
chimneys and roofs, resplendent here and there. An endless roar,
the eternal trample of the marching city, came mingled with vague
cries. At intervals the woman out by the stove moved restlessly and
coughed.</p>

<p>Over the transom from the hall-way came two voices.</p>

<p>'Johnnie!'</p>

<p>'Wot!'</p>

<p>'You come right here t' me! I want yehs t' go t' d' store fer
me!'</p>

<p>'Ah, ma, send Sally!'</p>

<p>'No, I will not! You come right here!'</p>

<p>'All right, in a minnet!'</p>

<p>'Johnnie!'</p>

<p>'In a minnet, I tell yeh!'</p>

<p>'Johnnie&mdash;' There was the sound of a heavy tread, and later
a boy squealed. Suddenly the clergyman started to his feet. He
rushed forward and peered. The little old woman was dead.</p>
