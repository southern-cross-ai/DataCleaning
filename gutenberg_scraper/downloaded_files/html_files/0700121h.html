<h1><a name="c01" id="c01">ONE</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>As his goaded horse plunged into the road, Nevada looked back
over his shoulder. The lane he had plowed through the crowd let
him see back into the circle where the three men lay prostrate.
The blue smoke from his gun was rising slowly, floating away. Ben
Ide's face shone white and convulsed in the sunlight.</p>
<p>"So long, Pard!" yelled Nevada, hoarsely, and stood in his
stirrups to wave his sombrero high. That, he thought, was
farewell forever to this friend who had saved and succored and
uplifted him, whom he loved better than a brother.</p>
<p>Then Nevada faced the yellow road down which his horse was
racing, and the grim and terrible mood returned to smother the
heart-swelling emotion which had momentarily broken it.</p>
<p>There was something familiar and mocking about this
precipitate flight on a swift horse, headed for the sage and the
dark mountains. How often had he felt the wind sting his face on
a run for his life! But it was not fear now, nor love of life,
that made him a fugitive.</p>
<p>The last gate of the ranch was open, and Nevada flashed
through it to turn off the road into the sage and go flying down
the trail along the shore of the lake. The green water blurred on
one side of him and the gray sage on the other. Even the winding
trail was indistinct to eyes that still saw red. There was no
need now for this breakneck ride. To be sure, the officers of the
law would eventually get on his track, as they had been for
years; but thought of them scarcely lingered a moment in his
consciousness.</p>
<p>The action of a swift and powerful horse seemed to be
necessary to the whirling of his mind. Thoughts, feelings,
sensations regurgitated around that familiar cold and horrible
sickness of soul which had always followed the spilling of human
blood and which this time came back worse than ever.</p>
<p>The fierce running of the horse along the levels, around the
bends of the trail, leaping washes, plunging up and down the
gullies, brought into tense play all Nevada's muscular force. It
seemed like a mad race away from himself. Burning and wet all
over, he gradually surrendered to physical exertion.</p>
<p>Five miles brought horse and rider far around to the other
side of the lake. Here the trail wound down upon the soft sand,
where the horse slowed from run to trot, and along the edge of
the lake, where the midday sun had thawed the ice. Nevada had a
break in his strained mood. He saw the deep hoof tracks of horses
along the shore, and the long cuts and scars on the ice, where he
and Ben and the freed outlaws had run that grand wild stallion,
California Red, to his last plunge and fall. Nevada could not
help but think, as he passed that place, and thrill as he
remembered the strange lucky catch of the wild horse Ben Ide
loved so well. What a trick for fortune to play! How mad Ben had
been--to bargain with the rustlers they had captured--to trade
their freedom for the aid they gave in running down the red
stallion! Yet mad as that act had been, Nevada could only love
Ben the more. Ben was the true wild-horse hunter.</p>
<p>Nevada reached the bluff where Forlorn River lost itself in
the lake, and climbed the sloping trail to the clump of trees and
the cabin where he and Ben had lived in lonely happiness. Ben,
the outcast son of a rich rancher of Tule Lake--and he, the
wandering, fugitive, crippled gunman, whom Ben had taken in with
only one question.</p>
<p>"Where you from?" Ben had asked.</p>
<p>"Nevada," had been the reply. And that had been the only name
by which Ben had ever known him.</p>
<p>It was all over now. Nevada dismounted from his wet and
heaving horse. "Wal, Baldy," he said, throwing the bridle, "heah
we are. Reckon the runnin's aboot over." And he sank heavily upon
the porch step, pushed his sombrero back to run a hand through
his wet hair, smoothing it away from his heated brow. He gazed
across the lake toward the dots on the far gray slope--the dots
that were the cabins and barns of the Blaine ranch. With the
wrench which shook him then, the last of that icy nausea--that
cold grip from bowels to heart--released its cramping hold and
yielded to the softening human element in Nevada. It would have
been better for him if that sinister fixity of mind had not
passed away, because with its passing came a slow-growing
agony.</p>
<p>"Reckon I cain't set heah mopin' like an owl," soliloquized
Nevada, getting up. "Shore, the thing's done. An' I wouldn't have
it otherwise. . . . Dear old Ben!"</p>
<p>But he could not just yet enter the cabin where he had learned
the glory of friendship.</p>
<p>"He was the only pard I ever had, except a hoss or two. . . .
Wal, Ben's name is cleared now--thank God. Old Amos Ide knows the
truth now an' he'll have to beg forgiveness of Ben. Gosh! how
good that'll be! But Ben, he'll never rub it in on the old gent.
He'll be soft an' easy. . . . Hart Blaine will know, too, an'
he'll have to come round to the boy. They'll all have to crawl
for callin' Ben a rustler. . . . Ben will marry Ina now--an'
he'll be rich. He's got California Red, too, an' he'll be
happy."</p>
<p>From the lake Nevada gazed away across Forlorn River, over the
gray sage hills, so expressive of solitude, over the black ranges
toward the back country, the wilderness whence he had come and to
which he must return. To the hard life, the scant fare, the
sordid intimacy of crooked men and women, to the border of
Nevada, where he had a bad name, where he could never sleep in
safety, or wear a glove on his gun-hand! But at that moment
Nevada had not one regret. He was sustained and exalted by the
splendid consciousness that he had paid his debt to his friend.
He had saved Ben from prison, cleared his name of infamy, given
him back to Ina Blaine, and killed his enemies. Whatever had been
the evil of Nevada's life before he met Ben, whatever might be
the loneliness and bitterness of the future, neither could change
or mitigate the sweetness and glory of the service he had
rendered.</p>
<p>Nevada went into the cabin. He had expected to find it as
always, clean and neat and comfortable. The room, however, was in
rude disorder. It had been ransacked by violent hands. The
pseudo-sheriffs, who had come at the beck of Less Setter to
arrest Ben, had not hesitated to stoop to thievery. They had
evidently searched the cabin for money, or anything of value.</p>
<p>Nevada gazed ponderingly around on this disorder.</p>
<p>"Wal," he muttered, grimly, "I reckon Less Setter won't be
rammin' around heah any more--or any other place short of
hell!"</p>
<p>With that remark Nevada strode out and down the path to the
corrals. There were horses in at the watering trough. He caught
one, and securing packsaddle and packs, he returned to the cabin.
Here he hurriedly gathered his belongings and food, blankets,
ammunition. Then mounting his horse he drove the pack animal
ahead of him, and rode down to the shallow ford across Forlorn
River.</p>
<p>"Shore, Ben will always keep this ranch as we had it," he
mused. "An' he'll come heah often."</p>
<p>Hot tears fell from Nevada's eyes, the first he had shed since
his orphaned boyhood, so dim and far away. It was no use to turn
his eyes again to the little gray cabin half hidden among the
trees, for he could not see. But as he rode up the river his
tears dried, and he saw the pasture where the horses he had owned
with Ben raised their heads to look and to neigh. From a ridge
top a mile or more up the lonely river, Nevada gazed back at the
cabin for the last time. Something surer than his intelligence
told him that he would never see it again. The moment was
poignant. It opened a door into his mind, which let in the fact
he had so stubbornly resisted--that when he bade good-by to the
little cabin it was not only good-by to it and to his friend, but
to the most precious of all that had ever entered his
life--Hettie Ide.</p>
<p>Nevada made that farewell, and then rode on, locked in thought
which took no notice of the miles and the hours. Sunset brought
him to an awareness of the proximity of night and the need of
suitable camp for himself and his animals. While crossing the
river, now a shallow rod-wide stream, he let the horses drink. On
the other side he dismounted to fill his waterbag and canteen.
Then he rode away from the river and trail in search of a
secluded spot. He knew the country, and before long reached a
valley up which he traveled some distance. There was no water and
therefore an absence of trails. Riding through a thicket of
slender oaks, which crossed the narrowing valley, he halted in a
grassy dell to make his camp.</p>
<p>His well-trained horses would not stray beyond the grass plot,
and there was little chance of the eyes of riders seeing his camp
fire. How strange to be alone again! Yet such loneliness had been
a greater part of his life before he chanced upon Ben Ide. From
time to time Nevada's hands fell idle and he stood or knelt
motionless while thought of the past held him. In spite of this
restlessness of spirit he was hungry and ate heartily. By the
time his few camp chores were done, night had fallen, pitch
black, without any stars.</p>
<p>Then came the hour he dreaded--that hour at the camp fire when
the silence and solitude fell oppressively upon him. Always in
his lonely travels this had been so, but now they were vastly
greater and stranger. Something incomprehensible had changed him,
sharpened his intelligence, augmented his emotions. Something
tremendous had entered his life. He felt it now.</p>
<p>The night was cold and still. A few lonesome insects that had
so far escaped the frost hummed sadly. He heard the melancholy
wail of coyotes. There were no other sounds. The wind had not
risen.</p>
<p>Nevada sat cross-legged, like an Indian, before his camp fire.
It was small, but warm. The short pieces of dead hard oak burned
red, like coal. Nevada spread his palms to the heat, an old habit
of comfort and pleasure. He dreaded to go to the bed he had made,
for he would fall asleep at once, then awake during the night, to
lie in the loneliness and stillness. The longer he stayed awake
the shorter that vigil in the after hours of the night. Besides,
the camp fire was a companion. It glowed and sparkled. It was
something alive that wanted to cheer him.</p>
<p>The moment came when Hettie Ide's face appeared clearly in the
gold and red embers. It shone there, her youthful face crowned by
fair hair, with its earnest gray eyes and firm sweet lips. It
looked more mature than the face of a sixteen-year-old
girl--brave and strong and enduring.</p>
<p>Strange and terrible to recall--Nevada had kissed those sweet
lips and had been kissed by them! That face had lain upon his
breast and the fair hair had caressed his cheek. They would haunt
him now, always, down the trails of the future, shining from
every camp fire.</p>
<p>"Hettie--Hettie," he whispered, brokenly, "you're only a kid
an' shore you'll forget. I'm glad Ben never knew aboot us. It'll
all come out now after my gunplay of to-day. An' you an' Ben will
know I am Jim Lacy! . . . Oh, if only I could have kept it
secret, so you'd never have known I was bad! An', oh--there'll
never be any one to tell you I cain't be bad no more!"</p>
<p>Thus Nevada mourned to himself while the shadow face in the
fire softened and glowed with sweetness and understanding. It was
an hour when Nevada's love mounted to the greatness of sacrifice,
when he cast forever from him any hope of possession, when he
realized all that remained was the glory and the dream, and the
changed soul which must be true to the girl who had loved him and
believed in him.</p>
<p>Beside that first camp fire Nevada's courage failed. He had
never, until now, realized the significance of that moment when
Hettie and he, without knowing how it had come to pass, found
themselves in each other's arms. What might have been! But that,
too, had only been a dream. Still, Nevada knew he had dreamed it,
believed in it, surrendered to it. And some day he might have
buried the past, even his name, and grasped the happiness
Hettie's arms had promised. Ben would have joyfully accepted him
as a brother. But in hiding his real name, in living this
character Nevada, could he have been true to the soul Ben and
Hettie had uplifted in him? Nevada realized that he could no
longer have lived a lie. And though he would not have cared so
much about Ben, he had not wanted Hettie to learn that he had
been Jim Lacy, notorious from Lineville across the desert wastes
of Nevada clear to Tombstone.</p>
<p>"Reckon it's better so," muttered Nevada to the listening camp
fire. "If only Hettie never learns aboot the real me!"</p>
<p>The loss of Hettie was insupportable. He had been happy
without realizing it. On the steps of friendship and love and
faith he had climbed out of hell. He had been transformed. Never
could he go back, never minimize the bloody act through which he
had saved his friend from the treachery of a ruthless and evil
man. That act, as well, had saved the Blaines and the Ides from
ruin, and no doubt Ina and Hettie from worse. For that crafty
devil, Setter, had laid his plans well.</p>
<p>Nevada bowed his bare head over his camp fire, and a hard sob
racked him.</p>
<p>"Shore--it's losin' her--that kills me!" he ground out between
his teeth. "I cain't--bear it."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When he crawled into his blankets at midnight it was only
because the conflict within him had exhausted his strength. Sleep
mercifully brought him oblivion. But with the cold dawn his
ordeal returned, and the knowledge that it would always abide
with him. The agony was that he could not be happy without Hettie
Ide's love--without sight of her, without her smile, her touch.
He wanted to seek some hidden covert, like a crippled animal, and
die. He wanted to plunge into the old raw life of the border,
dealing death and meeting death among those lawless men who had
ruined him.</p>
<p>But he could not make an end to it all, in any way. The
infernal paradox was that in thought of Ben's happiness, which he
had made, there was an ecstasy as great as the agony of his own
loss. Furthermore, Hettie's love, her embraces, her faith had
lifted him to some incredible height and fettered him there,
forever to fight for the something she had created in himself. He
owed himself a debt greater than that which he had owed Ben. Not
a debt to love, but to faith! Hettie had made him believe in
himself--in that newborn self which seemed now so all-compelling
and so inscrutable.</p>
<p>"Baldy, I've shore got a fight on my hands," he said to his
horse, as he threw on the saddle. "We've got to hit the back
trails. We've got to eat an' sleep an' find some place where it's
safe to hide. Maybe, after a long while, we can cross over the
desert to Arizona an' find honest work. But, by Heaven! if I have
to hide all my life, an' be Jim Lacy to the bloody end, I'll be
true to this thing in my heart--to the name Ben Ide gave
me--Nevada--the name an' the man Hettie Ide believed in!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nevada traveled far that day, winding along the cattle trails
up the valleys and over the passes. He began to get into high
country, into the cedars and piñons. Far above him the black
timber belted the mountains, and above that gleamed the snow
line. He avoided the few cattle ranches which nestled in the
larger grass valleys. Well-trodden trails did not know the
imprint of his tracks that day; and dusk found him camped in a
lonely gulch, with high walls and grassy floor, where a murmuring
stream made music.</p>
<p>Endless had been the hours and miles of the long day's ride.
Camp was welcome to weary man and horses. The mourn of a wolf,
terrible in its haunting prolonged sadness and wildness, greeted
Nevada by his camp fire. A lone gray wolf hungering for a mate!
The cry found an echo in the cry of Nevada's heart. He too was a
lone wolf, one to whom nature had been even more cruel.</p>
<p>And once again a sweet face with gray questioning eyes gleamed
and glowed and changed in the white-red heart of the camp
fire.</p>
<p>On the following day Nevada climbed the divide that separated
the sage and forest country from the desert beyond. It was a low
wide pass through the range, easily surmountable on horseback,
though the trail was winding and rough. The absence of cattle
tracks brought a grim smile to Nevada's face. He knew why there
were none here, and where, to the south through the rocky
fastness of another and very rough pass, there were many. But few
ranchers who bought or traded cattle ever crossed that
divide.</p>
<p>From a grassy saddle, where autumn wild flowers still bloomed
brightly, he gazed down the long uneven slope of the range, to
the canyoned and cedared strip of California, and on to the
border of Nevada, bleak, wild, and magnificent. The
gray-and-yellow desert stretched away illimitably, with vast
expanse of hazy levels and endless barren ranges. The prospect in
some sense resembled Nevada's future, as he imagined it.</p>
<p>As he gazed mournfully out over this tremendous and monotonous
wasteland a powerful antagonism to its nature and meaning swept
over him. How he had learned to love the fragrant sage country
behind him! But this desert was hard, bitter, cruel, like the men
it developed. He hated to go back to it. Could he not find a
refuge somewhere else--surely in far-off sunny Arizona? Yet
strange to tell, this wild Nevada called to something deep in
him, something raw and deadly and defiant.</p>
<p>"Reckon I'll hide out a while in some canyon," he
reflected.</p>
<p>Then he began the descent from the divide, and soon the great
hollow and the upheaval of land beyond were lost to his sight.
The trail zigzagged down and up, under the brushy banks, through
defiles of weathered rock, over cedar ridges, on and on down out
of the heights.</p>
<p>Before Nevada reached the end of that long mountain slope he
heard the dreamy hum of a tumbling stream, and turning off the
trail he picked his way over the roughest of ground to the rim of
a shallow canyon, whence had come the sound of falling water. He
walked, leading his horses for a mile or more before he found a
break in the canyon wall where he could get down.</p>
<p>Here indeed was a lonely retreat. Grass and wood were
abundant, and tracks of deer and other game assured him he could
kill meat. A narrow sheltered reach of the canyon, where the
cottonwood trees still were green and gold and the grass grew
rich along the stream, appeared a most desirable place to
camp.</p>
<p>So he unpacked his horses, leisurely and ponderingly, as if
time were naught, and set about making a habitation in the wilds.
From earliest boyhood this kind of work had possessed infinite
charm. No time in his life had he needed solitude as now.</p>
<p>Nevada did not count the days or nights. These passed as in a
dream. He roamed up and down the canyon with his rifle, though he
used it only when he needed meat. He spent hours sitting in sunny
spots, absorbed in memory. His horses grew fat and lazy. Days
passed into weeks. The cottonwoods shed their leaves to spread a
golden carpet underneath. The nights grew cold and the wind
moaned in the trees.</p>
<p>The time came when solitude seemed no longer endurable. Nevada
knew that if he lingered there he would go mad. For there
encroached upon his dream of Hettie Ide and Ben, and that one
short beautiful and ennobling period of his life, a strange dark
mood in which the men he had killed came back to him. Nevada had
experienced this before. The only cure was drink, work, action, a
mingling with humankind, the sound of voices. Even a community of
the most evil of men and women could save him from that haunting
shadow in his mind.</p>
<p>Somberly he thought it all out. Though he had deemed he was
self-sufficient, he found his limitations. He could no longer
dwell alone in this utter solitude, starving his body, falling
day by day deeper into melancholy and mental aberration. There
seemed to be relief even in the thought of old associations. Yet
Nevada shuddered in his soul at the inevitable which would force
him back into the old life.</p>
<p>"Reckon now it's aboot time for me to declare myself," he
muttered. "I cain't lie to myself, any more than I could to
Hettie. I've changed. I change every day. Shore I don't know
myself. An' this damned life I face staggers me. What am I goin'
to do? I say find honest work somewhere far off. Arizona,
perhaps, where I'd be least known. That's what Hettie would
expect of me. She'd have faith I'd do it. . . . An', by Gawd! I
<i>will</i> do it! . . . But for her sake an' Ben's, never
mindin' my own, I've got to hole up till that last gun-throwin'
of mine is forgotten. If I were found an' recognized as Jim Lacy
it'd be bad. An' if anyone did, it'd throw the light on some
things I'd rather die than have Hettie Ide know."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c02" id="c02">TWO</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>It was a cold, bleak November day when Nevada rode into
Lineville. Dust and leaves whipped up with the wind. Columns of
blue wood smoke curled from the shacks and huts and houses of the
straggling hamlet. Part of these habitations, those on one side
of the road, lay in California, and those on the other belonged
to Nevada. Many a bullet had been fired from one state to kill a
man in the other.</p>
<p>Lineville had been a mining town of some pretensions during
the early days of the gold rush. Deserted and weathered shacks
were mute reminders of more populous times. High on the bleak
drab foothill stood the ruins of an ore mill, with long chute and
rusted pipes running down to the stream. Black holes in the
cliffs opposite attested to bygone activity of prospectors. Gold
was still to be mined in the rugged hills, though only in scant
quantity. Prospectors arrived in Lineville, wandered around for a
season, then left on their endless search, while other
prospectors came. When Nevada had last been there it was possible
to find a few honest men and women, but the percentage in the
three hundred population was small.</p>
<p>Nevada halted before a gray cabin set well back in a large
plot of ground just inside the limits of the town. The place had
not changed. A brown sway-back horse, with the wind ruffling his
deep fuzzy coat, huddled in the lee of an old squat barn. Nevada
knew the horse. Corrals and sheds stood farther back at the foot
of the rocky slope. Briers and brush surrounded a garden where
some late greens showed bright against the red dug-up soil.
Nevada remembered the rudely painted sign that had been nailed
slantwise on the gate-post Lodgings.</p>
<p>Dismounting, Nevada left his horses and entered, to go round
to the back of the cabin. A wide low porch had been stacked to
the roof with cut stove wood, handy to the door. Nevada hesitated
a moment, then knocked. He heard a bustling inside, brisk
footsteps, after which the door was opened by a buxom matron,
with ruddy face, big frank eyes, and hair beginning to turn
gray.</p>
<p>"Howdy, Mrs. Wood!" he greeted her.</p>
<p>The woman stared, then burst out: "Well, for goodness' sake,
if it ain't Jim Lacy!"</p>
<p>"I reckon. Are you goin' to ask me in? I'm aboot froze."</p>
<p>"Jim, you know you never had to ask to come in my house," she
replied, and drew him into a cozy little kitchen where a hot
stove and the pleasant odor of baking bread appealed powerfully
to Nevada.</p>
<p>"Thanks. I'm glad to hear that. Shore seems like home to me.
I've been layin' out in the cold an' starvin' for a long
time."</p>
<p>"Son, you look it," she returned, nodding her head
disapprovingly at him. "Never saw you like this. Jim, you used to
be a handsome lad. How lanky you are! An' you're as bushy-haired
as a miner. . . . What've you been up to?"</p>
<p>"Wal, Mrs. Wood," he drawled, coolly, "shore you've heard
aboot me lately?" And his gaze studied her face. Much might
depend upon her reply, but she gave no sign.</p>
<p>"Nary a word, Jim. Not lately or ever since you left."</p>
<p>"No? Wal, I am surprised, an' glad, too," replied Nevada,
smiling his relief. "Reckon you couldn't give me a job? Helpin'
around, like I used to, for my board."</p>
<p>"Jim, I jest could, an' I will," she declared. "You won't have
to sleep in the barn, either."</p>
<p>"Now, I'm dog-gone lucky, Mrs. Wood," replied Nevada,
gratefully.</p>
<p>"Humph! I don't know about that, Jim. Comin' back to Lineville
can't be lucky. . . . Ah, boy, I'd hoped if you was alive you'd
turned over a new leaf."</p>
<p>"It was good of you to think of me kind like that," he said,
moving away from the warm stove. "I'll go out an' look after my
pack an' horses."</p>
<p>"Fetch your pack right in. An' I'll not forget you're
starved."</p>
<p>Nevada went out thoughtfully, and slowly led his horses out to
the barn. There, while he unpacked, his mind dwelt on the
singular effect that Mrs. Wood's words had upon him. Perhaps
speech from anyone in Lineville would have affected him
similarly. He had been brought back by word of mouth to
actualities. This kindly woman had hoped he would never return.
He took so long about caring for his horses and unpacking part of
his outfit that presently Mrs. Wood called him. Then shouldering
his bed-roll and carrying a small pack, he returned to the
kitchen. She had a hot meal prepared. Nevada indeed showed his
need of good and wholesome food.</p>
<p>"You poor boy!" she said once, sadly and curiously. But she
did not ask any questions.</p>
<p>Nevada ate until he was ashamed of himself. "Shore I know what
to call myself. But it tasted so good."</p>
<p>"Ahuh. Well, Jim, you take some hot water an' shave your
woolly face," she returned. "You can have the end room, right off
the hall. There's a stove an' a box of wood."</p>
<p>Nevada carried his pack into the room designated, then
returned for the hot water, soap, and towel. Perhaps it was the
dim and scarred mirror that gave his face such an unsightly
appearance. He was to find out presently that shaving and clean
clothes and a vastly improved appearance meant nothing to him,
because Hettie had gone out of his life forever. What did he care
how he looked? Yet he remembered with a twinge that she would
care. When an hour later he strode into the kitchen to confront
Mrs. Wood, she studied him with eyes as speculative as kind.</p>
<p>"Jim, I notice your gun has the same old swing, low down. Now
that's queer, ain't it?" she said, ironically.</p>
<p>"Wal, it shore feels queer," he responded. "For, honest, Mrs.
Wood, I haven't packed it at all for a long time."</p>
<p>"An' you haven't been lookin' at red liquor, either?" she went
on.</p>
<p>"Reckon not."</p>
<p>"An' you haven't been lookin' at women, either?"</p>
<p>"Gosh, no. I always was scared of them," he laughed, easily.
But he could not deceive her.</p>
<p>"Boy, somethin' has happened to you," she declared, seriously.
"You're older. Your eyes aren't like daggers any more. They've
got shadows. . . . Jim, I once saw Billy the Kid in New Mexico.
You used to look like him, not in face or body or walk, but jest
in some way, some <i>look</i> I can't describe. But now it's
gone."</p>
<p>"Ahuh. Wal, I don't know whether or not you're complimentin'
me," drawled Nevada. "Billy the Kid was a pretty wild
<i>hombre,</i> wasn't he?"</p>
<p>"Humph! You'd have thought so if you'd gone through that
Lincoln County cattle war with me an' my husband. They killed
three hundred men, and my Jack was one of them."</p>
<p>"Lincoln County war?" mused Nevada. "Shore I've heard of that,
too. An' how many of the three hundred did Billy the Kid
kill?"</p>
<p>"Lord only knows," she returned, fervently. "Billy had
twenty-one men to his gun before the war, an' that wasn't
countin' Greasers or Injuns. They said he was death on them. . .
. Yes, Jim, you had the look of Billy, an' if you'd kept on you'd
been another like him. But somethin' has happened to you. I ain't
inquisitive, but have you lost your nerve? Gunmen do that
sometimes, you know."</p>
<p>"Shore, that's it, Mrs. Wood. I've no more nerve than a
chicken," drawled Nevada, with all his old easy coolness. It was
good for him to hear her voice and to exercise his own.</p>
<p>"Shoo! An' I'll bet that's all you tell me about yourself,"
she said. "Jim Lacy, you left here a boy an' you've come back a
man. Wonder what Lize Teller will think of you now. She was moony
about you, the hussy!"</p>
<p>"Lize Teller," echoed Nevada, ponderingly. "Shore I remember
now. Is she heah?"</p>
<p>"She about bosses Lineville, Jim. She doesn't live with my
humble self any more, but hangs out at the Gold Mine."</p>
<p>Nevada found a seat on a low bench between the stove and the
corner, a place that had been a favorite with him and into which
he dropped instinctively, and settled himself for a talk. This
woman held an unique position in the little border hamlet, in
that she possessed the confidence of gamblers, miners, rustlers,
everybody. She was a good soul, always ready to help anyone in
sickness or trouble. Whatever her life had been in the past--and
Nevada guessed it had been one with her outlaw husband--she was
an honest and hard-working woman now. In the wild days of his
former association with Lineville he had not appreciated her. She
probably had some other idler or fugitive like himself doing the
very odd jobs about the place that he had applied for. Nevada
remembered that her kindliness for him had been sort of motherly,
no doubt owing to the fact that he had been the youngest of the
notorious characters of Lineville.</p>
<p>"Lize married yet?" began Nevada, casually.</p>
<p>"No indeed, an' she never will be now," replied Mrs. Wood,
forcibly. "She had her chance, a decent cattleman named Holder,
from Eureka. Reckon he knew he was buyin' stolen cattle. But for
all that he was a mighty fine sort for Lineville. Much too good
for that black-eyed wench. She was taken with him, too. Her one
chance to get away from Lineville! Then Cash Burridge rode in one
day--after a long absence. 'Most as long as yours. Cash had been
in somethin' big, south somewhere. An' he came back to lie low
an' gamble. He had plenty of money, as usual. Lost it, as usual
Lize was clerk at the Gold Mine. She got thick with Cash. He an'
Holder had a mixup over the girl, an' that settled her. Maybe I
didn't give her a piece of my mind. But I might as well have
shouted to the hills. She went from bad to worse. You'll
see."</p>
<p>"Cash Burridge back," rejoined Nevada, somberly, and he
dropped his head. That name had power to make him want to hide
the sudden fire in his eyes. "Reckon I'd plumb forgot Cash."</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! Yes, you did, Jim Lacy," replied the woman,
knowingly. "No one would ever forget Cash, much less you. . . .
Dear me, I hope you an' he don't meet again."</p>
<p>"Wal, of course we'll meet," said Nevada. "I cain't hang round
your kitchen all the while, much as I like it."</p>
<p>"Jim, I didn't mean meet him on the street, or in the store,
or anywhere. You know what I meant."</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Mother Wood. Reckon Cash an' I won't clash.
Because I'm not lookin' for trouble."</p>
<p>"You never did, my boy, I'll swear to that. But you never run
from it. An' you know Cash Burridge. He's bad medicine sober, an'
hell when he's drunk."</p>
<p>"Ahuh, I reckon, now you remind me. Has Cash been up to his
old tricks lately?"</p>
<p>"I haven't heard much, Jim," she returned, thoughtfully.
"Mostly just Lineville gossip. No truth in it, likely."</p>
<p>Nevada knew it would do no good to press her further in this
direction, which reticence was proof that Cash Burridge had been
adding to his reputation one way or another. Nevada had a curious
reaction--a scorn for his own strange, vague eagerness to know.
Old submerged or forgotten feelings were regurgitating in him. A
slow heat ran along his veins.</p>
<p>"Lineville shore looks daid," he said, tentatively.</p>
<p>"It <i>is</i> dead, Jim. But you know it's comin' on winter.
An' this Lineville outfit is like a lot of groundhogs. They hole
up when the snow flies. There's more travel along the road than
ever before. Three stages a week now, an' lots of people stop
here for a night. I get a good many; been busy all summer an'
fall."</p>
<p>"Travel on the road? Wal, that's a new one for Lineville.
Prospectors always came along. But travel. What you mean, Mother
Wood?"</p>
<p>"Jim, where have you been for so long?" she asked, curiously.
"Sure you must have been buried somewhere. There's a new minin'
town--Salisbar. An' travel from north has been comin' through
here, in spite of the awful road."</p>
<p>"Salisbar? Never heard aboot it. An' stagecoaches--goin'
through Lineville. By golly!"</p>
<p>"Jim, there's been only couple of hold-ups. None of this
outfit, though. We hear the stage line will stop runnin' soon,
till spring."</p>
<p>"You mentioned aboot a cattleman named Holder buyin' heah
since I've been away. Shore he's not the only one?"</p>
<p>"No. But cattle deals have been low this summer. Last bunch of
cattle come over in June."</p>
<p>"Wal, you don't say! Lineville is daid, shore enough."</p>
<p>"Jim, that sort of thing has got to stop sometime, even if it
is only a lot of two-bit rustlin'."</p>
<p>"Two-bit? Ha! Ha!"</p>
<p>"Jim, I've seen thousands of longhorns rustled in my day."</p>
<p>"Ahuh! Reckon you have, I'm sorry to say," responded Nevada,
looking up at her ruddy face again. "Shore you never took me for
a rustler, did you, Mother?"</p>
<p>"Goodness, no! You was only a gun-packin' kid, run off the
ranges. But, Jim, you'll fall into it some day, sure as shootin'.
You'll be in bad company at the wrong time. Now I'm from Texas
an' I always loved a good clean hard-shootin' gunman, like Jack
was. There wasn't nothin' crooked about Jack for years an' years.
But he fell into it. An' so will you, Jim. I want you to go so
far away from Lineville that you can't never come back."</p>
<p>"I'll go in the spring. Shore I'm not hankerin' for the
grabline ride these next few months."</p>
<p>"Fine. That's a promise, my boy. I'll not let you forget it.
An' meanwhile it'll be just as well for you to be snug an' hid
right here. Till spring, huh?"</p>
<p>"Mother Wood, you said you wasn't inquisitive," laughed
Nevada, parrying her question. Then he grew serious. "When was
Hall heah last?"</p>
<p>"In June, with the last cattle that come over the divide. An',
Jim, the right queer fact is he's never been back."</p>
<p>"Wal, I reckon that's not so queer to me. Maybe he has shook
the dust of Lineville. He rode in heah sudden, so I was told. An'
why not ride off that way? To new pastures, Mother Wood?"</p>
<p>"No reason a-tall," she said, reflectively. "Only I jest don't
feel that way about Hall."</p>
<p>"An' that high-flyin' Less Setter from the Snake River
country. Did he ever come again?"</p>
<p>"No. That time you clashed with Setter was the only time he
ever hit Lineville. No wonder! They said you'd kill him if he
did. I remember, Jim, how that night after the row you talked a
lot. It was the drink. You'd had trouble with Setter before you
come to these parts. I never told it, but I remember."</p>
<p>"Wal, Mother, I came from the Snake River country, too,"
replied Nevada, with slow dark smile.</p>
<p>"It was said here that Less Setter was too big a man to fiddle
around Lineville," returned the woman, passing by Nevada's
cryptic remark, though it was not lost upon her. "Hall said
Setter had many brandin' irons in the fire. His game, though, was
to wheedle rich cattlemen an' ranchers into speculations. He was
a cunnin' swindler, low-down enough for any deal. An' he had a
weakness for women. If nothin' else ever was his downfall, that
sure would be. He tried to take Lize Teller away with him."</p>
<p>"Wal, you don't say!" ejaculated Nevada, trying to affect
interest and surprise that were impossible for him to feel. Again
he casually averted his face to hide his eyes. For that cold,
sickening something had shuddered through his soul. Less Setter
would never have a weakness for women again. He would never weave
his evil machinations around Ben and Hettie Ide, or anyone else,
for he and two of his arch conspirators had lain dead there in
the courtyard before Hart Blaine's cabins on the shores of Wild
Goose Lake Ranch. Dead by Nevada's hand! That was the deed that
had saved Ben Ide, and Hettie, too. It seemed long past, yet how
vivid the memory! The crowd that had melted before his charging
horse! The terror of the stricken Setter! Revenge and retribution
and death! Those villains lay prone under the drafting gunsmoke,
before the onlookers. Nevada saw himself leap back to the saddle
and spur his horse away. One look back! "So long, pard!" One look
at Ben's white, convulsed face, which would abide with him
forever.</p>
<p>"Lineville has had its day," the woman was saying, as if with
satisfaction at the fact. "Setter saw that, if he ever had any
idea of operatin' here. Hall saw it, too, for he's never come
back. Cash Burridge knows it. He has been away to the
south--Arizona somewhere--lookin' up a place where outside travel
hasn't struck. He'll leave when the snow melts next spring, an'
he'll not go alone. Then decent people won't be afraid to walk
down to the store."</p>
<p>"Good luck for Lineville, but bad for Arizona somewhere,"
returned Nevada, dryly. "Shore, I feel sorry for the ranchers
over there."</p>
<p>"Humph! I don't know. There are wilder outfits in Arizona than
this country ever saw," rejoined the woman, contemptuously. "Take
that Texas gang in Pleasant Valley, an' the Hash Knife outfit on
the Tonto Rim, not to speak of the Mexican border. Cash Burridge
isn't the caliber to last long in Arizona. Waters an' Blink
Miller are tough nuts to crack, I'll admit. I suppose Hardy Rue
will trail after Burridge, an' of course that loud-mouthed Link
Cawthorne. But there's only one of the whole Lineville outfit
that could ever last in Arizona. An' you know who he is, Jim
Lacy."</p>
<p>"Wal, now, Mother, I shore haven't the least idee," drawled
Nevada.</p>
<p>"Go long with you," she replied, almost with affection. "But,
Jim, I'd rather think of you gettin' away from this life than
lastin' out the whole crew. I've heard my husband say that gunmen
get a mind disease. The gunman is obsessed to kill. An' if
another great killer looms on the horizon the disease forces him
to go out to meet this one. Jest to see if he can kill him! Isn't
that terrible? But it was so in Texas in the old frontier days
there."</p>
<p>"It shore is terrible," responded Nevada, gloomily. "I can
understand a man learnin' to throw a gun quick for self-defense.
Shore that was my own excuse. But for the sake of killin'! Reckon
I don't know what to call that."</p>
<p>During the hour Mrs. Wood, who had a gift for learning and
dispensing information of all sort, acquainted Nevada with all
that had happened in Lineville since his departure. She did not
confine herself to the affairs of the outlaw element who made of
Lineville a rendezvous. The few children Nevada had known and
played with, the new babies that had arrived in the interim, the
addition of several more families to the community, the talk of
having a school, and the possibilities of a post office
eventually--these things she discussed in detail, with a pleasure
and satisfaction that had been absent in her gossip about
Lineville's hard characters.</p>
<p>But it was that gossip which lingered in Nevada's mind. Later
when he went into his little room he performed an act almost
unconsciously. It was an act he had repeated a thousand times in
such privacy as was his on the moment, but not of late. The act
of drawing his gun! There it was, as if by magic, level, low down
in his clutching hand. Sight of it so gave Nevada a grim
surprise. How thoughtlessly and naturally the fact had come to
pass! And Nevada pondered over the singular action. Why had he
done that? What was it significant of? He sheathed the long blue
gun.</p>
<p>"Reckon Mrs. Wood's talk about Cawthorne an' the rest of that
outfit accounts for me throwin' my gun," he muttered to himself.
"Funny. . . . No--not so damn funny, after all."</p>
<p>He had returned to an environment where proficiency with a gun
was the law. Self-preservation was the only law among those
lawless men with whom misfortune had thrown him. He could not
avoid them without incurring their hatred and distrust. He must
mingle with them as in the past, though it seemed his whole
nature had changed. And mingling with these outlaws was never
free from risk. The unexpected always happened. There were always
newcomers, always drunken ruffians, always some would-be killer
like Cawthorne, who yearned for fame among his evil kind. There
must now always be the chance of some friend or ally of Setter,
who would draw on him at sight. Lastly, owing to the reputation
he had attained and hated, there was always the possibility of
meeting such a gunman as Mrs. Wood had spoken of--that strange
product of frontier life, the victim of his own blood lust, who
would want to kill him solely because of his reputation.</p>
<p>Nevada was not in love with life, yet he felt a tremendous
antagonism toward men who would wantonly destroy him.</p>
<p>"Reckon I'd better forget my dreamin' heah," he soliloquized.
"An' when I'm out be like I used to be. Shore it goes against the
grain. I'm two men in one--Nevada an' Jim Lacy. . . . Reckon Jim
better take a hunch."</p>
<p>Whereupon he deliberately set about ascertaining just how much
of his old incomparable swiftness on the draw remained with him
after the long lack of exercise. During more than one period of
his career he had practiced drawing his gun until he had worn the
skin of his hand to the quick, and then to callousness.</p>
<p>The thing had become a habit for his private hours, wherever
he might be.</p>
<p>"Slower'n molasses, as Ben used to say aboot me," he muttered.
"But I've the feel, an' I can get it all back."</p>
<p>The leather holster on his belt was hard and stiff. He oiled
it and worked it soft with strong hands. The little room, which
had only one window, began to grow dark as the short afternoon
waned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was still daylight, however, when Nevada went out, to walk
leisurely down the road into town. How well he remembered the
wide bare street, with its lines of deserted and old buildings,
many falling to ruin, and the high board fronts where the painted
signs had been so obliterated by weathering that they were no
longer decipherable! He came at length to the narrow block where
there were a few horses and vehicles along the hitching-rails,
and people passing to and fro. There were several stores and
shops, a saloon, and a restaurant, that appeared precisely as
they had always been. A Chinaman, standing in a doorway, stared
keenly at Nevada. His little black eyes showed recognition. Then
Nevada arrived at a corner store, where he entered.</p>
<p>The place had the smell of general merchandise, groceries, and
tobacco combined. To Jones' credit, he had never sold liquor.
There was a boy clerk waiting on a woman customer, and Jones, a
long lanky Westerner, who had seen range days himself.</p>
<p>"Howdy, Mr. Jones!" said Nevada, stepping forward.</p>
<p>"Howdy yourself, stranger!" replied the storekeeper. "You got
the best of me."</p>
<p>"Wal, it's a little dark in heah or your eyes are failin',"
returned Nevada, with a grin.</p>
<p>Whereupon the other took a stride and bent over to peer into
Nevada's face.</p>
<p>"I'm a son-of-a-gun," he declared. "Jim Lacy! Back in
Lineville! I've seen fellers come back I liked less."</p>
<p>He shook hands heartily with Nevada. "Where you been, boy? You
sure look well an' fine to me."</p>
<p>"Oh, I've been all over, knockin' aboot, lookin' for a job,"
drawled Nevada, easily.</p>
<p>"An' you come back to Lineville in winter, lookin' for a job?"
laughed Jones.</p>
<p>"Shore," drawled Nevada.</p>
<p>"Jim, I'll bet if I offered you work you'd shy like a colt.
Fact is, though, I could do it. I'm not doin' so bad here.
There's a lumber company cuttin' up in the foothills. It's a long
haul to Salisbar, but they pass through here. Heard about
Salisbar?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Reckon I'll have to take a look at it. How far
away?"</p>
<p>"Eighty miles or so," returned Jones. "Some miners struck it
rich, an' that started Salisbar off as a minin' town. But it's
growin' otherwise. Besides mineral, there are timber an' water,
some good farmland, an' miles of grazin'. All this is wakin'
Lineville up. There's business goin' on an' more comin'."</p>
<p>"Shore I'm glad, Mr. Jones," said Nevada. "Lineville has some
good people I'd like to see prosper."</p>
<p>From the store Nevada dropped into a couple of places, where
he renewed acquaintance with men who were glad to see him; and
then he crossed to the other side of the wide street and went
down to the Gold Mine. Dark had fallen and lamps were being
lighted. The front of the wide two-story structure appeared quite
plain and business-like, deceiving to the traveler. It looked
like a respectable hotel. But the Gold Mine was a tavern for the
outlaw elect, a gambling hell and a drinking dive that could not
have been equaled short of the Mexican border.</p>
<p>Nevada turned the corner to take the side entrance, which led
into the long dingily-lighted barroom. A half-dozen men stood
drinking and talking at the bar. They noted Nevada's entrance,
but did not recognize him, nor did he them. The bartender, too,
was strange to Nevada. A wide portal, with curtain of strung
beads, opened into a larger room, which was almost sumptuously
furnished for such a remote settlement as Lineville. The red
hangings were new to Nevada, and some of the furniture. He
remembered the gaudy and obscene pictures on the wall, and the
card and roulette tables, and particularly the large open
fireplace, where some billets of wood burned ruddily. Six men sat
around one table, and of those whose faces were visible to Nevada
he recognized only one, that of a gambler called Ace Black. His
cold eyes glinted on Nevada, then returned to his game.</p>
<p>Nevada took the seat on the far side of the fire, where he
could see both entrances to the large room. At the moment there
was something akin to bitter revolt at the fact of his presence
there. Certainly no one had driven him. No logical reason existed
for his visiting the Gold Mine. He would never drink again; he
had but little money to gamble with, even had he been so
inclined; he rather felt repugnance at the thought of seeing Lize
Teller, or any other girl likely to come in. But something
restless and keen within him accounted for his desire to meet old
acquaintances there. Trying to analyze and understand it, Nevada
got to the point of dismay. Foremost of all was a significant
motive--he did not care to have Cash Burridge or his followers,
especially Link Cawthorne, or anyone ever associated with Setter,
think he would avoid them. Yet that was exactly what Nevada
wanted to do. The mocking thing about it was the certainty that
some kind of conflict would surely result. He could not avoid
this. Deep in him was a feeling that belied his reluctance. Could
it be a rebirth of old recklessness? He would have to fight that
as something untrue to Hettie Ide. And as a wave of sweet and
bitter emotion went over him, a musical rattling of the
beaded-curtain door attracted his attention.</p>
<p>A girl entered. She had a pale face, and very large black eyes
that seemed to blaze at Nevada.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c03" id="c03">THREE</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>She came slowly toward him, with the undulating movement of
her lissome form that he remembered even better than her tragic
face. Life had evidently been harsher than ever to Lize
Teller.</p>
<p>Nevada rose and, doffing his sombrero, shook hands with
her.</p>
<p>"Jim Lacy!" she ejaculated, with stress of feeling that seemed
neither regret nor gladness.</p>
<p>"Howdy, Lize!" drawled Nevada. "Reckon you're sort of
surprised to see me heah."</p>
<p>"Surprised? Yes. I thought you had more sense," she
returned.</p>
<p>"Wal, now Lize, that's not kind of you," he said, somewhat
taken back. "An' I reckon I just don't get your hunch."</p>
<p>"Sit down, Jim," she rejoined, and as he complied she seated
herself on the arm of his chair and leaned close. "I've been
looking for you all afternoon. Lorenzo saw you ride in and stop
at Mrs. Wood's."</p>
<p>"Ahuh! Wal, no wonder you wasn't surprised."</p>
<p>"But I am, Jim. Surprised at your nerve and more surprised at
the look of you. What's happened? You've improved so I don't know
you."</p>
<p>She leaned against him with the old coquetry that was a part
of her and which Nevada had once found pleasing, though he had
never encouraged it.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Lize. Wal, there was shore room for improvement.
Nothin' much happened, except I've been workin' an' I quit the
bottle."</p>
<p>"That's a lot, Jim, and I'm downright glad. I'll fall in love
with you all over again."</p>
<p>"Please don't, Lize," he laughed. "I've quit throwin' guns,
too. An' I reckon it'd be unhealthy for me, if you did."</p>
<p>"Probably will be, boy. You sure have me guessing," she
replied, and she smoothed his hair and his scarf, while she gazed
at him with deep, burning, inquisitive eyes. "But don't try to
lie to me about your gun tricks, sonny. You forget I'm the only
one around Lineville who had you figured."</p>
<p>"Lize, I don't know as I remember that," he said, dubiously.
He found she embarrassed him less than in former times. He had
always feared Lize's overtures. But that dread was gone.</p>
<p>"Jim, you forget easily," she rejoined, with a touch of
bitterness. "But God knows there was no reason for you to
remember <i>me.</i> It was natural for me to miss you. For you
were the only decent man I knew. But you treated me like you were
a brother. And that made me hate you."</p>
<p>"Lize, you didn't hate me," he said. "That was temper. Maybe
you got a little miffed because you couldn't make a fool of me
like you did the others. Shore I cain't believe you'd be mean
enough to hate me."</p>
<p>"Jim, you don't know women," she replied, bitterly. "I can do
anything. . . . Where'd you say you'd been--workin'--all this
long while?"</p>
<p>"Wal, now, Lize, I don't recollect sayin'," he drawled. "Shore
never liked to talk aboot myself. What have you been doin'?"</p>
<p>"Me! Aw, hell! Can't you see? If I live another year I'll be
in the street. . . . I hate this damned life, Jim. But what can I
do? . . . Of course Mrs. Wood told you all she knew about
me."</p>
<p>"Wal, she told me--some," replied Nevada, hesitatingly. "Wish
I'd been heah when you made such a darn fool of yourself.</p>
<p>"I wish to God you had," she flashed, with terrible passion.
"You'd have shot Cash Burridge. He double-crossed me, Jim. Oh, I
know I'm no good, but I'm honest. Cash actually made me believe
<i>he</i> would marry me. I told Holder I was not a good girl. He
seemed willing to take me, anyhow. But Cash told him a lot of
vile lies about me, and it fell through. . . . I'm working here
at the Gold Mine now--everything from bookkeeper to
bartender."</p>
<p>"Lize, I heah you're thick with Link Cawthorne," said
Nevada.</p>
<p>"Bah! You can call it thick, if you like," she returned,
scornfully. "But I call it thin. He's a jealous tight-fisted
brag. He's as mean as a coyote. I was half drunk, I guess, when I
took up with him. And now he thinks he owns me."</p>
<p>"Wal, Lize, wouldn't it be interestin' for me right now--if
Link happened in?" drawled Nevada.</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! More so for me, Jim," she trilled. "I'll give him
something to be jealous about. But Link could never be
interesting to you. He's a bluff."</p>
<p>"All the same, Lize, if you'll excuse me I'll stand up an' let
you have the chair," replied Nevada, coolly, as he extricated
himself and arose.</p>
<p>She swore her amaze. "What the devil's come over you, Jim
Lacy?" she demanded. "Why, two years ago, if Link Cawthorne had
come roaring in here with two guns you'd have laughed and turned
your back."</p>
<p>"Two years ago! Lize, I've learned a lot in that long
time."</p>
<p>With sudden change of manner and lowering of voice she
queried, sharply, "Jim, did you kill Less Setter?"</p>
<p>Nevada had braced himself for anything from this girl, so at
the point-blank question he did not betray himself.</p>
<p>"Setter! . . . Is he daid?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he's daid," she replied, flippantly mimicking his
Southern accent. "And a damn good thing. . . . Jim Lacy, I lay
that to you."</p>
<p>"Wal, Lize, I cain't stop the wonderin's of your mind, but
you're shore takin' a lot upon yourself," he returned,
coldly.</p>
<p>She caught his hand.</p>
<p>"Jim, I didn't mean to offend," she said, hastily. "I remember
you were queer about--you know--when you'd had some gunplay."</p>
<p>"Ahuh? Wal, there's no offense. Reckon I'm sort of hurt that
you accuse me."</p>
<p>"Jim, I notice you don't <i>deny</i> it," she retorted, with
her brilliant searching eyes on him. "But listen. Only a few
people in Lineville have heard Setter is dead. You know how we
keep mum about that sort of thing. I heard it from a chance
traveler who stayed here overnight. Setter had been shot by a
wild-horse hunter over in California. That was all. That reminded
me of something else. Last summer Steve Elkins saw you in a
saloon in Hammell. He used to come through here occasionally and
he'd seen you. So when I remembered that, I remembered you had a
grudge on Setter, also that you loved wild-horse hunting, and I
put two and two together and figured <i>you</i> had done for
Setter. But I've never mentioned my suspicions to anyone. I'm not
sure, but I don't believe anyone here has connected you with that
little gunplay. Cash Burridge was glad enough to hear the news,
you can bet. He had been sent to Arizona by Setter on some deal
only the two of them were in. Cash had a roll of money big enough
to stop up a stovepipe. He went to Arizona. And he never saw
Setter again. That I know, for he told me so. Well, he didn't
tell me how he'd benefited by Setter's death. I figured that,
too."</p>
<p>"Lize, you're shore a clever girl," said Nevada, admiringly.
"Reckon you hit most deals right on the haid. But shore I'd
rather you didn't give me credit for removin' so many undesirable
citizens from the world. You used to do that. I'm not Billy the
Kid, or Plummer, or Wess Hardin."</p>
<p>"Have it your own way, Jim," she returned, with a sly laugh.
"And now for what I was coming to. Did you ever hear of Hardy
Rue?"</p>
<p>"Wal, yes, somewhere or other that name struck me. Never saw
the man, though."</p>
<p>"He wasn't here during your time. But he's here now, and he's
the man for you to watch. I think he was Setter's right hand man
and came to Lineville to check up on Cash Burridge. They don't
get along. I'd say Rue is a dangerous man. Deep sort of chap,
seldom talks, never drinks, hates women, and has an eye like a
hawk. He's . . . Hello! Somebody calling me. I forgot I have to
work. I'll see you later. You bet I want to be around when Link
strolls in."</p>
<p>She ran from the room, leaving Nevada with plenty to think
about. Yet he was considerably relieved that his name had not
been openly used in connection with Setter's death. That would
have made his position less secure in Lineville. Not that
security in this border town was possible for him or any other of
its desperate men!</p>
<p>Gradually the gaming tables filled up. More than one keen-eyed
player gave Nevada a curt nod of recognition. Probably everybody
in Lineville now knew of his return. There was nothing unusual
about that. All of these men were absent now and then. Nevada
felt that he labored with an unreasonable desire to be somebody
else, thus to avoid the complications sure to be woven around the
name Jim Lacy.</p>
<p>He was approached presently by two newcomers, one of whom, a
little alert man, no longer young, with a face like that of a
weasel, and eyes that had a trick of opening and shutting
quickly, he recognized as Blink Miller.</p>
<p>"Howdy, Blink!" he replied to the other's greeting.</p>
<p>"You're lookin' fust-rate, Lacy," replied Miller. "Shake hands
with my friend, Hardy Rue."</p>
<p>Nevada found himself under the surveillance of a quiet,
penetrating gray gaze. This man Rue was matured, a stalwart type
of miner rather than the rangy rider. He had a hard lined face,
with prominent chin and set thin lips.</p>
<p>"Care to drink with me, Lacy?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"No, thanks," replied Nevada. "Reckon I'm not fixed to buy
drinks, so I'm not acceptin' any."</p>
<p>"Ain't you grown awful particular since you've been away so
long?" queried Miller, with a smile.</p>
<p>"Wal, Blink, come to think aboot it, I have," drawled Nevada,
with all his old cool carelessness. "Particular aboot not owin'
anybody favors an' particular aboot who I drink with."</p>
<p>Nevada, despite his calculations beforehand, could not help
giving that tart answer. If it was anything it was an instinct of
antagonism, quick to grasp antagonism in others.</p>
<p>Miller blinked at Nevada. "Reckon that's particular nice of
you, Lacy. Nobody wants to buy drinks for a feller who's
broke."</p>
<p>Then Rue gave Nevada an inscrutable look, more deceiving for
the pleasant voice with which he accompanied it.</p>
<p>"But you're not particular about throwin' a gun on--anybody?"
he queried.</p>
<p>Nevada's cool bright stare was not so deceptive. And then he
drawled: "Not at all--not at all, Mr. Rue. Shore it's just a
habit. I never mean anythin' uncivil."</p>
<p>The two men passed on to a gaming table, where seats evidently
awaited them. Nevada turned on his heel, muttering: "Damn them
anyhow. They just cain't let me alone."</p>
<p>Among others who entered presently was Cash Burridge. He was a
tall man nearing forty, but he looked younger. He had the build
of a horseman, a fine figure in top-boots and spurs. Nevada was
quick to see where he packed his gun, and that was significant.
Burridge was a handsome, dissolute man, blond, with a curling
mustache, almost gold, and light, gleaming, restless blue
eyes.</p>
<p>Nevada knew that Burridge had seen him the instant of
entrance, if not before, and he wondered what the outcome would
be. It did not matter one way or another to Nevada. Burridge had
been the ringleader in the stage hold-up to which Nevada had been
a party. The one deed to which he owned with shame!</p>
<p>At length Burridge disengaged himself from his companions and
deliberately walked around between the tables to get to
Nevada.</p>
<p>"Jim, I'm dog-gone glad to see you!" he said, extending his
hand, and his handsome face corroborated his words.</p>
<p>"Howdy, Cash!" replied Nevada, meeting the outstretched hand.
"Reckon I'm glad you're glad to see me."</p>
<p>"It's good you blew in. I've often wondered what'd become of
you. I'll tell you, Jim, I'm not curious about where you've been
or what you've been doin', but I'm plumb interested in what
you're goin' to do."</p>
<p>"Why so?" asked Nevada, not without surprise. He was not
wholly proof against Burridge's warm welcome.</p>
<p>"Are you goin' to hole up here this winter, same as the rest
of us?" queried Burridge.</p>
<p>"Reckon I am, as far as I know," returned Nevada, slowly
feeling his way.</p>
<p>"Broke?" queried Burridge, with a knowing look.</p>
<p>"Shore am."</p>
<p>"I'm not so well heeled myself, but I can stake you to a
roll."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Cash. But I cain't borrow. I don't like borrowin',
an' maybe I never could pay back. I'll get a job for my keep
heah. An' the cairds an' drinks won't bother me."</p>
<p>"Jim, what'll you do after the snow flies?"</p>
<p>"I'll be hanged if I know," replied Nevada, truthfully
enough.</p>
<p>"That's all I wanted to hear," spoke up Burridge, with great
satisfaction. "I've got a deal on--the biggest I ever handled.
It's--"</p>
<p>"Cash, reckon you're not goin' to ask me to rustle cattle with
you?" interrupted Nevada, severely.</p>
<p>"No. I swear I'm not," hastily returned Burridge, and if he
was not sincere, he surely was a splendid actor. "By Heaven! it's
an honest deal, Jim."</p>
<p>"Wal, I'm glad to heah you say that. An' I'll listen to
you."</p>
<p>"This ain't the place for us to talk. Besides, I've a poker
game on. The deal I'm in is big; it's cattle, an' it's honest.
I've got to have a hard-shootin' outfit, an' a leader with a
reputation like yours."</p>
<p>"But, Cash, I heard you say this deal was honest," protested
Nevada.</p>
<p>"If it ain't then I don't know what honesty is," declared
Burridge, forcibly. "Sure my talk is plumb misleadin'. But you
wait till I tell you all about the deal."</p>
<p>"Wal, Cash, I'll shore try to be patient waitin'," drawled
Nevada.</p>
<p>"I'm givin' you a hunch," rejoined Burridge. "Keep it to
yourself."</p>
<p>Burridge withdrew then to his card game, while Nevada returned
to his chair by the fire. "What the devil is Cash up to now?"
pondered Nevada. "Honest deal? Cattle? Hard-shootin' outfit . . .
I'll be darned."</p>
<p>Nevada discovered that the word honest inhibited all his
deductive powers in relation to what Cash Burridge might be
engaged in. Cash's deliberate assertion was a poser. Nevada could
not solve it. But he grasped one significant fact at once, and
that was a motive for Burridge's warm greeting. He had never
before shown any kindliness to Nevada. Where Burridge had any
special interest he could be agreeable, and, if the case
required, most persuasive and dominating. These traits, however,
had never before been exercised upon Nevada.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the saloon and gambling room filled up. In the
former there was raucous noise and in the latter a contrasting
silence, broken by the low voice of a gamester now and then, and
a clink of coin, or the whir and rattle of the roulette wheel.
During this period Nevada sat beside the fire, glancing at it
occasionally, but seeing always those who came in and went out.
The glowing embers of any fire cast a spell upon Nevada, always
bringing the face which haunted his waking and sleeping
hours.</p>
<p>A little later Lize Teller returned, and before he could get
up to offer her the chair she had plumped herself over the
arm.</p>
<p>"You sit still or I'll jump into your lap," she threatened,
half petulantly and half merrily. She would have done it, too;
therefore Nevada decided he had better be quiet. What had once
been shyness in him had now become aloofness.</p>
<p>"But, Lize, shore if you want to make a show of yourself, you
don't need to pick on me," mildly protested Nevada.</p>
<p>"Jim Lacy, there isn't a man in this room, except you, who
wouldn't put his arm around me if I sat like this on his
chair."</p>
<p>"Wal, suppose you let me see some of them do it."</p>
<p>"Aha, you're the smart one. Listen! If you want to make me
your friend--I say <i>friend</i>--forever, just be lover-like for
a few minutes. Or if you can't be that, make a bluff at it."</p>
<p>Nevada laughed at her in spite of the annoyance he could
scarcely conceal. "What're you up to, Lize?"</p>
<p>"Link Cawthorne just came in," she replied, tossing her black
head defiantly.</p>
<p>She still had some of the charms of girlhood left. With what
pity in his heart did Nevada recognize this, and contrast the
havoc of her face with the semblance of the thing she momentarily
felt!</p>
<p>"So I reckoned," replied he. "Wal, Lize, it may be fun for you
to use me in your little tricks, but it mightn't be funny for me.
An' it might turn out bad for Link."</p>
<p>"That's why. He makes me sick. I'm so tired of him I ache. . .
. He's in there drinking. I want him to come in and find me with
you. He was up all last night, in a card game, and he doesn't
know you're here."</p>
<p>"Lize, it strikes me you don't want very much a-tall,"
returned Nevada. "I hate to be rude to a lady, but <i>I</i> want
to get up."</p>
<p>"I'll make it worse," she almost hissed, with the somber fire
in her eyes leaping to a blaze. "You know me."</p>
<p>"All right. I reckon it's bad enough without you makin' it
worse," he said, with a forced resignation.</p>
<p>"Bad? Bah! I can handle Link Cawthorne. All I want is for the
conceited lout to <i>see</i> I can like some other man."</p>
<p>"Lize, I reckon you must have given Link some reason for bein'
so conceited. Now didn't you?"</p>
<p>"I suppose I did. I thought I was mad about him, but I guess I
was only mad at Cash Burridge. . . . Women are strange, Jim."</p>
<p>"Wal, you cain't prove it by me," answered Nevada.</p>
<p>"There he comes," she whispered, in fiendish glee, and then
leaned over Nevada, radiant with some feeling quite beyond his
comprehension.</p>
<p>Nevada looked up, not without a stir in his veins. Link
Cawthorne stood with the bead curtain parted. How well Nevada
remembered the heated face, the beady little eyes too close
together, the reckless, weak, leering lips, the choice and manner
of garb that inclined to dandyism. Indeed, he had been called the
dandy outlaw, an epithet far from displeasing to him.</p>
<p>Nevada doubted Lize's assertion that Link had been unaware of
his return to Lineville. He certainly did not start, nor change
his expression materially. But he looked steadily at Lize, while
she babbled to Nevada, apparently oblivious to her lover's
advent.</p>
<p>Nevada's feeling, in that moment, changed from a good-natured
contempt for Link and a vexation at his own part in this little
farce to something vastly different. It seemed to be premonition
that amounted to shock. He saw something, as a dream might
foreshadow a future event--something that moved gray, cold,
sickening across the swift stream of his consciousness. The
sensation was so sudden and dismaying that Nevada heard nothing
of Lize's whispered pretenses. It took violent effort of will,
which was effected with Cawthorne's stalking across the room, to
return to his cool, keen self.</p>
<p>A year and more did not set lightly upon Link Cawthorne's
features. Nevada judged all these men by the changes that had
risen in himself. Cawthorne halted before Lize and Nevada,
bending his lean, hawklike head, with his elbows crooked and his
hands at his hips. His right hand covered the butt of a gun
belted high. Whatever he had intended to say or do manifestly
yielded to the passion which arose at close range. His
gimlet-eyes fastened first upon Lize, who did not turn her face
away from Nevada for a long moment. Then Lize's glance traveled
from Cawthorne's! boots slowly upward, at last to meet his
piercing gaze with surprise that seemed as genuine as
insolent.</p>
<p>"Oh, you here?" she said. "Link, have you ever met my old
friend, Jim Lacy?"</p>
<p>"Cat!" he spat out, fiercely, and his body jerked with the
liberation of something in the word.</p>
<p>"Howdy, Link!" interposed Nevada, thinking to pour oil on the
troubled waters. "Reckon Lize has forgotten you an' me was
acquainted."</p>
<p>"Forget--hell!" responded Cawthorne, in hard scorn. "Never
mind Lize. I'll settle with her. I'm addressin' you, Jim
Lacy."</p>
<p>Nevada seemed a long moment in replying, during which he
looked steadily up at Cawthorne.</p>
<p>"Ahuh. Wal, strikes me you're not very civil aboot it."</p>
<p>"Strikes me you're too familiar with Lize," flashed Cawthorne,
hotly.</p>
<p>"Familiar? Say, you're out of your haid. If it's any of your
business, we're old acquaintances. Shore I never had nothin' but
a brotherly feelin' for her. An' if she wants to sit on the arm
of my chair--"</p>
<p>"Guff!" interrupted the other. "She was sittin' on your lap.
An' that won't go with me."</p>
<p>"Link, look for yourself," returned Nevada, quietly. "There's
where she's been all the time. Shore that isn't anythin' to raise
a row, even if you an' she are engaged."</p>
<p>"Pooh!" burst out Lize, airily.</p>
<p>That word must have been a blow to Cawthorne, and his whole
body leaped with a muscular violence.</p>
<p>"Jim Lacy, you're a liar!" he burst out, stridently.</p>
<p>Lize, swift as a panther, slid off Nevada's chair, to spring
erect like a released willow bough. Nevada could not see her. He
heard her panting breaths. He was gazing hard up at Cawthorne's
face, which had suddenly turned white. In his ungovernable fury
he had said what had not been calculated upon. A sudden cessation
of all sound from the gamesters was proof that they had heard him
denounce Nevada. Cawthorne stood a moment as one transfixed, if
not with terror, then with the inevitableness of catastrophe.</p>
<p>"Now, Link, I'm not a liar an' you know it," replied Nevada,
without evident stress. "Reckon I can make allowance for your
feelin's."</p>
<p>The young outlaw's face lost its pallor and rigidity. It waved
red, and all at once his hair appeared to bristle. His youth, his
fury, his conceit, not to define his lack of penetration, misled
him into mistaking Nevada's reply.</p>
<p>"I'll have no allowances from you," he shouted. "I'm invitin'
you for a little walk outdoors."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c04" id="c04">FOUR</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Nevada calmly rose to his feet and stepped aside from the
chair. He did not believe that Cawthorne would attempt to draw on
him, but as there was no certainty, he wanted to be on his feet.
Even at the moment he seemed strange to himself. Yet after that
first flash he felt coolly master of himself.</p>
<p>Cawthorne, more emboldened every instant, shouted the
louder:</p>
<p>"I'm invitin' you outdoors."</p>
<p>"What for?" queried Nevada.</p>
<p>"You know what for."</p>
<p>"I haven't an idee, Link," went on Nevada. "Shore I see you're
r'iled. But I reckon there's no call for me to get r'iled, too,
aboot your mistake. It's cold outdoors. An' I like this warm
fire. If you've any more to say, why, go ahaid."</p>
<p>Cawthorne expanded under this wholly unprecedented experience.
A few drinks had addled his brains and an unreasonable jealousy
had set them on fire. To realize Jim Lacy had refused the
challenge born of wild haste had set him on the pinnacle of his
dream of fame.</p>
<p>"Say?" he demanded, with hoarse and pompous contempt. "I've no
more to say. I've called you, an' you're yellow. That's all."</p>
<p>Whereupon he turned to the amazed and discomfited Lize and,
half leading, half dragging her, left the room. The business of
the gamblers was resumed, with a loud laugh here and caustic
remarks there. Nevada heard the content of some of them: "What
the hell's got into Lacy?" . . . "He always was a decent chap." .
. . "Reckon he couldn't kill thet durn fool right before the
girl's eyes." . . . "You're wrong, gentlemen," said a cold-voiced
gambler. "That was a little by-play between a real gunman and a
would-be. I've seen it often."</p>
<p>As Nevada resumed his chair and drew it closer to the fire
these and other remarks did not escape him, and that of the
gambler lingered with him moodily. Gradually his momentary
depression passed away. He saw Hettie Ide's face in the golden
glow of the fire. How he quivered in heart and body! He had been
put to the test and he had been true to what she would have
expected of him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nevada went early to his lodgings and his sleep was
untroubled. When he awoke in the morning he was glad to face the
sun.</p>
<p>There was plenty of work for him to do, which he set about
with a will. He found tasks that Mrs. Wood did not think of.
Thus, with most of the daylight hours passed in manual labor,
Nevada began his winter in Lineville.</p>
<p>For nearly a week he stayed away from the Gold Mine. Then one
night at supper Mrs. Wood spoke up seriously:</p>
<p>"Jim, that big-mouthed Link Cawthorne is braggin' around
you're afraid to come downtown."</p>
<p>"Wal, you don't say," drawled Nevada.</p>
<p>"Yes, I do say. I don't like it at all, Jim. You can't let him
keep that up."</p>
<p>"Shore, I don't care what Link says."</p>
<p>"Son, that's not the way of the West," she went on, gravely.
"I've lived all my life on the frontier. No man can afford to
lose the respect of his associates, even if they are mostly a
worthless outfit of gamblers, rustlers, an' sech. They can't
understand it. Least of all Link Cawthorne can't. He's likely to
shoot you from behind a corner an' swear he met you on an even
break."</p>
<p>"But, Mother Wood, what can I do?" queried Nevada, robbed of
his imperturbability.</p>
<p>"Well, as long as you're here in Lineville be Jim Lacy as
<i>they</i> used to know him," she declared, forcefully. "If you
let this towhead run amuck with his brag, pretty soon he'll get
the nerve actually to draw on you. Now, Jim, you don't want to
have to kill him. Lize was fond of him. An' if she's fond of
anyone it keeps her straight. You go downtown an' slap Link's
face. Take his gun away from him an' stick it down the back of
his pants!"</p>
<p>Nevada laughed mirthlessly. "Wal, maybe you're right," he
said, with a sigh. "By gosh; I wish spring would come, so I could
hit the trail."</p>
<p>"Mark my words, son," she replied, earnestly, "the best way
for you to make sure of spring an' summer an' fall is to be
yourself!"</p>
<p>Nevada went back to the Gold Mine, dubious in mind, once more
doubtful that he could ever escape the inevitable consequences of
his name.</p>
<p>It chanced that Link Cawthorne was sober and deeply involved
in a card game, where he was having a remarkable run of good
luck. He merely sneered when Nevada strolled in.</p>
<p>Cash Burridge, however, made at once for Nevada, with all show
of friendliness.</p>
<p>"Where you been, Lacy?" he inquired, disapprovingly. "We've
certainly looked for you here."</p>
<p>"Aw, been workin' hard an' goin' to bed early," replied
Nevada. "Then, Cash, I reckon I wanted to avoid meetin'
Cawthorne."</p>
<p>"Bah!" snorted Burridge. "You'll have to shoot that damned
brag, an' the sooner you do it the better we'll all be
pleased."</p>
<p>"Wal, we won't argue aboot it, Cash, but I'm not seein' it
that way."</p>
<p>"I'll bet you five to one Link will nag you to draw. I've seen
a hundred four-flushers like him. An' they all got the same."</p>
<p>"Wal, I cain't bet with you, that's shore," returned Nevada,
in good humor.</p>
<p>"Let's go up to my room, where we can have a quiet talk," said
the other, and led the way through the hall and upstairs.</p>
<p>"Shore, you're comfortable heah," remarked Nevada, gazing
around the room.</p>
<p>"I like it nice when I'm not in the saddle," returned
Burridge. "Take a seat, an' if you won't drink have a smoke. . .
. One more word about this Link Cawthorne. He was harmless enough
until Lize made him a snake in the grass. That girl is a hell's
rattler. My advice is for you to beat the daylights out of Link
or call his bluff an' kill him."</p>
<p>"Reckon I'm some worried, Cash," admitted Nevada.</p>
<p>"A man like you must always worry," rejoined Burridge, with
evident sympathy. "You can't ever be free unless you hide your
name. It's bad enough to have sheriffs after you, an' natural
enemies, but it must be hell to know there're men who want to
kill you just because of your reputation."</p>
<p>"Wal, I hope I don't get sore an' go back to drinkin'," said
Nevada, gloomily.</p>
<p>"Jim, I want to talk serious to you now," went on Burridge,
with change of voice.</p>
<p>"Wal, fire away. You'll shore get my honest opinion,
anyway."</p>
<p>"Lineville is gettin' a little too much travel to suit me. In
another year it won't be any place for me, let alone you. Agree
with me?"</p>
<p>"Shore do. When spring comes I go for good."</p>
<p>"Exactly. Same here. Now I want to tell you about my deal.
I'll tell you straight. An' if you don't want to go in with me,
it'll be all right, only I want you to respect my confidence here
in Lineville. Will you do it?"</p>
<p>"I reckon," replied Nevada, soberly.</p>
<p>Burridge showed satisfaction at that assurance, but he plainly
hesitated over the next disclosure. Little flecks of light danced
in his eyes, suddenly to coalesce in a set, cold gleam.</p>
<p>"Jim, you knew Setter was shot over in California?" he
queried, sharply.</p>
<p>"I heard it from Lize," rejoined Nevada, matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>"Killed by a wild-hoss hunter," went on Burridge, with
emotion. "Jim, there are men who connect you with that
gun-play."</p>
<p>"Shore. I get blamed for a lot of things," returned Nevada,
imperturbably.</p>
<p>"Well, that's none of my business," spoke up Burridge, with
more relief, "only I want to say that whoever killed Setter did
me a good turn."</p>
<p>"Me too. Setter did me dirt once, over on the Snake
River."</p>
<p>Burridge drew a long breath and laid aside his cigar.</p>
<p>"Listen," he began, with tenseness. "I was in on several deals
with Setter. After he left here he sent for me to meet him at
Klamath Falls. I did it. He had gotten in with big cattlemen an'
had more money than he knew how to spend. He told me he wouldn't
risk settlin' down in Oregon. He'd sell out there pretty soon,
an' he wanted a new an' safe place. No more rustlin' or sharp
speculation with other ranchers' money. He might marry. Anyway,
he was goin' in for honest ranchin', an' wanted me as a partner.
Well, the upshot was that he gave me a hundred thousand dollars
to buy a well-stocked ranch in Arizona. I was to own half, an' to
help him develop cattle an' horses on a big scale. He had never
been in Arizona an' only knew it by hearsay. He left the choice
of place to me, makin' the provision that I find a wild an'
unsettled range, where money would develop water."</p>
<p>Burridge halted in his narrative, the recital of which
manifestly stirred him deeply, and picking up his cigar he puffed
on it a moment, and leaned back in his chair, with his light hard
eyes intent upon his listener.</p>
<p>"Well," he resumed, "I went to Arizona an' rode hossback from
the New Mexico border clear to the White Mountains. Talk about
wild an' beautiful country! Arizona has everythin' beat. I bought
out a rancher who wasn't keen to sell. He owned a big ranch, had
miles of grazin' range, an' ten thousand head of stock. I ain't
tellin' you the location until you decide to accept my offer.
After the deal was settled an' property turned over to me I began
to get a few hunches. But I hustled back here an' sent word to
Setter. He hadn't consummated his deals over there. I waited. No
word came from him. I went back to Arizona--that was early last
summer. Then I had my eyes opened. It was funny. Such a joke on
<i>me,</i> an' especially Setter. Well, I had been huntin' for
wild country, an' you can gamble I'd hit on it. Our cattle were
bein' rustled right an' left. I suspected the very cowmen I'd
taken over with the property. It was a grand big country--desert,
canyon, plateau. There were many more ranchers an' cattle than
I'd suspected. Some of these ranchers were rustlers, thick with
the worst of the outfits. You've heard of the Hash Knife gang an'
the Pine Tree outfit. But nobody seemed to know just <i>who</i>
belonged to them an' <i>who</i> didn't. Then there were some hard
nuts known to everybody. This country around Lineville even in
gold-rush days couldn't hold a candle to that neck of the woods
in Arizona."</p>
<p>Burridge made a final flourish with the cigar he had let go
out.</p>
<p>"Now when I got back here a few weeks ago I sent word to
Setter an' waited. No reply. Then we heard Setter was dead. Hardy
Rue brought the news. I've a hunch he's got somethin' up his
sleeve. Anyway, he knew Setter, an' I'm not worryin'. That
property in Arizona is mine. An' my job is to get back there to
run it. Here's where you come in. Jim Lacy! That wouldn't sound
so pleasant to those outfits. I'll make you foreman an' give you
an interest. It'll take some fightin' to keep my cattle. I want a
bunch of the hardest-ridin' an' hardest-shootin' boys that can be
hired. An' you to lead them! . . . An' now a last word, Jim. You
know that many an honest an' prosperous rancher was once a
rustler. . . . What do you think an' what do you say?"</p>
<p>"Wal, Cash, reckon I'll think more'n I say," returned Nevada,
ponderingly. "You shore talked straight. I savvy when a man's
tellin' me the truth. It's a darn interestin' story. What the
courts might say aboot it I cain't guess. But I reckon half that
hundred thousand Setter gave you is honestly yours. Maybe the
other half, too. Nobody could tell just how much money Setter
earned an' what he got speculatin'. He was always careful to get
the other fellow to take the risks. Yes, sir, I reckon the
Arizona ranch is yours, all right."</p>
<p>"Good. I'm glad you see the deal that way," replied Burridge,
rubbing his hands together. "An' you'll accept my offer?"</p>
<p>"Cash, I cain't promise that yet," responded Nevada, slowly.
"Reckon to be honest, the day might come when I'd be glad to take
you up. But now I want time to think aboot it."</p>
<p>"Take all the time you want," spoke up Burridge, heartily.</p>
<p>"Wal, I might need a lot. There's a couple of points that'll
shore be hard to get over."</p>
<p>"What are they, Jim? I might help you."</p>
<p>"Wal, the first is--your past deals might crop up any
day."</p>
<p>"I thought long about that," returned Burridge, earnestly.
"An' at last I figured myself free of any worry. I'm not known in
Arizona. Idaho never knew me as Cash Burridge. An' what do any
two-bit deals here amount to? They'll be forgotten after I've
gone."</p>
<p>"Reckon you don't miss it far," replied Nevada. "But my second
point is the serious an' important one. That is, so far as I am
concerned."</p>
<p>"Shoot!" replied Burridge, with good-natured impatience.</p>
<p>"Wal, Cash, I don't mean any offense, but I'm just plain
doubtful that you can <i>ever</i> go straight."</p>
<p>Burridge threw his cigar at the stove and the dark blood waved
over his face in a tide. "By Heaven! that sticks in my craw, too!
I wonder. But I'm no damn fool an' I'm not without some
brains."</p>
<p>"Shore. I admit that. But, Cash, you've asked my opinion an'
heah it is. You've a weakness for women an' red liquor. An' the
crux of the deal is--can you stand prosperity?"</p>
<p>"Ha! I never had a chance to find out," replied Burridge,
clenching his fist. "I've got it now. We'll see. I swear I want
to make the best of it. An' I'd do better with my chance if I had
you beside me. That's all."</p>
<p>"Wal, I appreciate that, Cash, an' I'll think it over. What I
hate aboot it is livin' up to my name."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nevada went downstairs with Burridge and amused himself by
standing and walking in front of Cawthorne for a while. Lize did
not put in an appearance. It was mid-week and business was slack.
Nevada left the Gold Mine early, not forgetful that Mrs. Wood
surely would wait up for him. The night was dark and cold, with a
hint of snow in the air. The wind whistled through the leafless
trees. Excitement and distraction had somehow been good for him.
He found his landlady waiting up beside the kitchen fire.</p>
<p>"Wal, Mother Wood, heah I am, standin' on both feet an'
without any hole in my haid," he said, cheerily.</p>
<p>"So I see, Mr. Lacy," she returned. "But that might be only a
matter of luck. Did you run into Link?"</p>
<p>"Shore. I stood around hours, but nothin' happened. So I
reckon you got me all scared for nothin'."</p>
<p>"Scared! Pooh! I wish I could put the fear of the Lord in
you," she replied.</p>
<p>"Wal, I'll agree to let you, if you will give me a piece of
pie an' a mug of milk."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The short days passed, the snow fell, adding to Nevada's work.
In the evenings, if the weather was not stormy, he would drop in
at the Gold Mine. Burridge had made another strong plea for
Nevada to join him, and then had left for Arizona, intending to
make a wide detour through Oregon and California to avoid the
snow.</p>
<p>Lize Teller had passed from jest to earnest in her mood toward
Nevada. She was vain, willful, and malignant when under the
influence of drink. Her life worked daily toward some final
tragedy. During the early part of the winter she had made love to
Nevada, more, he thought, to inflame Cawthorne than for any other
reason. But the time came, which was coincident with Cawthorne's
further bold attempt to force or aggravate Nevada into a fight,
when she ceased wholly her flirting with Nevada. Soon after that
she broke her engagement with Cawthorne and took to wild
flirtations and drinking bouts with the gamblers. She lost all
restraint and began to fail in health.</p>
<p>When Nevada at length took her to task, as if indeed he were a
brother, he received an impression that gave him concern.</p>
<p>"No decent man wants me and I'm slated for hell," she told
him, bitterly.</p>
<p>From this speech Nevada conceived the idea that somehow he had
failed the girl. It could not have been otherwise, yet the fact
hurt him. Another side of the situation was the peril she had
incurred by jilting Cawthorne. There was, however, no use in
talking to Lize about that. Whenever Cawthorne accosted her,
whether humbly or harshly, or in a maudlin way, she flouted him
as she would have a repulsive dog.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Days and weeks went by, and this situation wore on, growing
toward its climax.</p>
<p>Nevada resisted his premonition of its outcome. Almost he
yielded to the urge to leave Lineville even in the dead of
winter. But the side of him that was Jim Lacy, brooding,
augmenting, always in conflict with Nevada, would not let him run
from a cheap bully and from a worthless girl whom he yet might
help. Something held Nevada back from the easiest escape out of
that dilemma.</p>
<p>Always there was encroaching upon his gentle kindly mood,
eating like a poison lichen into the sorrow and dream of his love
for Hettie Ide, lost to him forever, that dark instinctive fire
of spirit, that antagonism of the gunman.</p>
<p>Nevada acquitted himself of any responsibility for what he had
become. As a mere boy he had been thrown among brutal and evil
men. He had worked himself above their influence time and time
again, only to be thrown back, by accident, by chivalry in him to
redress a wrong done some one, by passion to survive, into that
character which fate had fastened upon him and to which he seemed
unfortunately and wonderfully fitted.</p>
<p>"Reckon it'll always be so for me," he soliloquized, somberly.
"I cain't get away from myself. . . . I wonder if Hettie would
believe me false to her faith. No! No! . . . I'll always know,
even if I'm forced to be Jim Lacy again, that I'm true to
her."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One afternoon Nevada, actuated by an impulse beyond his ken,
bent his steps toward the Gold Mine. All night an oppression had
persisted through his slumbers, and all morning he had been
restless, brooding.</p>
<p>He entered the place by the side door, and paused in the hall
before the entrance to the gambling room. The usual quiet of that
den had been disrupted.</p>
<p>With his left hand Nevada quickly opened the door and entered
sidewise, his right arm crooked. The room was full of men, all
standing. Cards, coins, chips, glasses on the tables showed
evidence of having been violently abandoned. There followed
whispers, a cough, shuffling of feet. The noise that had halted
Nevada came from the saloon. Suddenly it augmented to a banging
on the bar accompanied by the bellow of a harsh voice.</p>
<p>"Rum! Hand it out--er I'll bust your head, too!"</p>
<p>Nevada strode to the nearest group of men. Something terrible
had happened. He saw it in their faces. Immediately he connected
it with the raucous voice in the saloon.</p>
<p>"What's happened?" he queried.</p>
<p>"There's been a hell of a mess," replied one, wiping a moist
face.</p>
<p>"Jim, we was playin' our card games, quiet as usual," spoke up
the gambler, Ace Black, "when we heerd an awful row in the hall
there. Then a woman's screams, quick hushed, I'll tell you. An'
after that a heavy fall. We all jumped up an' some one rushed out
to see what it was. An' by Gawd--"</p>
<p>"Wal?" broke in Nevada, cool and grim, as Black choked.</p>
<p>"Lize Teller! She was layin' half naked, streamin' blood. Link
Cawthorne had beat her over the head with his gun. She'll die! .
. . An' listen to him!"</p>
<p>In three long bounds Nevada had reached and split the beaded
door-curtain. His swift eye swept all.</p>
<p><i>"Cawthorne!"</i> he yelled, in piercing voice that brought
an instant breathless silence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c05" id="c05">FIVE</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>It was springtime in northern California. Old Mt. Shasta stood
up grandly and took the morning light, his vast snowslopes
beginning to be ridged by black. From the Tule Lake depression
the land waved upward in wide belts, brown and gray, and at last
green as emerald.</p>
<p>Honk! Honk! Honk! The wild geese were coming from the south.
Great flocks in triangle formation, led by huge old honking
ganders, came flying over the sage hills, to circle the grain
fields and drop down among their fellows.</p>
<p>The wide acres of the Ide ranch, mostly lake-bottom land that
the draining of Tule Lake had made available, spread rich and
fertile along the southern shore. The squares of brown soil but
recently ploughed, the fields beginning to show a tinge of green,
the pasture lands, running far up on the gray sage slopes, the
droves of horses and herds of cattle, the hedge fences, the
orchards, young and old, the neat sheds and the rambling
red-roofed barn, and the white house half hidden in a grove of
maples and pines--all these amply testified to the prosperity of
the Ides.</p>
<p>Hettie Ide had awakened this morning twenty years old. The
wild geese that she had loved since childhood had come back from
their pilgrimage to the south, and were honking as if they knew
it was her birthday and that on this beautiful May day she must
be joyous with young life.</p>
<p>But Hettie had a secret sorrow, which she hid deep in her
heart, while she ministered to her ailing mother, and shared with
her brother Ben the one bitter drop in his cup of happiness.</p>
<p>It wanted an hour yet before breakfast. As Hettie tripped down
the stairs she heard Ina shrieking with laughter, no doubt at
little Blaine's pranks. How happy they were and how blessed by
God! But Hettie had no envy in her heart this birthday morning.
She was closer to Ben than ever, and she loved Ina and the child
as if indeed they were her own flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Hettie went outdoors. What a glorious morning! Bright and warm
was the sun; the birds were singing in the maples; violets lifted
their sweet faces out of the green; the wild-lilac buds were
bursting into pink.</p>
<p>She knew where to find Ben. Down in the hedge-lined lane to
the corrals she strolled, her heart full, yet with the old pang
keener, listening to the hum of bees and the honk of wild geese,
the bawl of calves and the twittering of the swallows.</p>
<p>Above all these sounds, so sweet to her listening ears, she
heard the shrill whistle of Ben's great wild stallion, California
Red. He was trooping across the pasture in defiance of Ben, or
venting his displeasure at the corral bars.</p>
<p>Hettie found Ben sitting on top of the corral fence.
California Red was inside, and indeed he did not like it. Hettie
halted to peep through at him. She loved this wonderful horse,
too, for his beauty, his spirit, and for another reason which
only Ben would ever have suspected.</p>
<p>California Red had been in captivity four years. He had been
broken, yet never had lost his spirit. It took a halter to make
him lower his ears and stop rolling his fine dark eyes. Red was
never gentle, but, on the other hand, he had not one mean trait.
He shone red, glossy, silken, beautiful, and his long mane was a
flame. He was a big horse, yet so perfectly proportioned that
most observers would not have judged his size. High and rangy,
with body round as a barrel, a wonderful deep wide chest, legs
powerful, yet not heavy, and an arching neck and noble head, he
looked indeed what he had been for years, the wild stallion king
of the sage hills of northern California.</p>
<p>Hettie climbed to a seat beside her brother.</p>
<p>"Mawnin', pard," she drawled, mimicking the Southern accent of
one neither of them ever forgot.</p>
<p>Ben gave a little start. He had been gazing out over the red
stallion, over the corrals and fields and the sage slopes, to
something beyond. Hettie did not often take such liberty with her
brother. But this was her birthday and she meant to recall
something of the past that might hurt them both.</p>
<p>"Wal, howdy there, old girl!" replied Ben, surprising her with
his answering drawl. Beneath the humor in his voice lay deep
feeling. But as he reached for her with his gloved hand he did
not look at her.</p>
<p>"What're you doing, Ben?" she asked, brightly, as she took his
hand in both hers.</p>
<p>"I was just coaxing that red son-of-a-gun," he replied,
nodding at the stallion.</p>
<p>"Red doesn't seem to obey you very well."</p>
<p>"I'd have to rope him before he'd lay down those ears."</p>
<p>"Ben, you mustn't expect him to grow tame."</p>
<p>"Tame? No, I only want him to love me."</p>
<p>"Perhaps love was left out of Red's makeup," laughed Hettie.
"Or perhaps he can't forgive you for taking him from his sage
hills. I certainly wouldn't love you, if I were Red."</p>
<p>"It's four years now," said Ben, thoughtfully. "What a long
time! I couldn't ask a finer, gamer horse. Sure there isn't one
in all California that can touch him. But I--I always seem to
want something from Red--I never get."</p>
<p>"Ben dear," replied Hettie, pressing his hand, "what you want
is something--some one to tame Red."</p>
<p>"I reckon. . . . The only man who ever could tame Red,"
muttered Ben, more to himself than to her.</p>
<p>"Your old pard, Nevada," she whispered, leaning closer.</p>
<p>Ben dropped his head, and his gloved hand closed tight on
Hettie's.</p>
<p>Not for a long time had Hettie dared to broach this subject
and now that she had, she meant to follow it up in a way to help
her, and perhaps Ben, too.</p>
<p>"Ben, this is my birthday," she spoke up, softly.</p>
<p>"Well, so it is," replied her brother, starting out of his
reverie. "I plumb forgot. But I reckon I can dig you up a present
of some kind. . . . Let's see, you must be
eighteen--nineteen."</p>
<p>"Twenty," she added, gravely.</p>
<p>"How time flies! Why, you're a grown woman, and a darned fine
handsome one, too. But you always seem my kid sister."</p>
<p>And as he turned to kiss her cheek she saw tears in his dark
eyes. There were threads of gray, too, in the hair over Ben's
temples. That shocked Hettie. He, so young and strong and virile!
But Ben, all those long years exiled from his home, outcast and
wild-horse hunter, had led a lonely and hard life. It was Nevada
who had saved him. And now, as so often in the past, she prayed
God to bless Nevada, and keep him good and clean and brave as
when she had known him.</p>
<p>"Ben," she spoke up, "I don't want any present on my twentieth
birthday. But I ask this. If I'm a woman now I'm old enough to be
listened to. Let me talk to you as I want--as I need to."</p>
<p>"Hettie, I'm sorry you had to ask me that," he returned,
contritely. "But you hurt so. . . . And I thought you just a--a
sentimental girl--that you'd forget."</p>
<p>"Forget <i>him?</i> Never," she whispered. "Have you
forgotten?"</p>
<p>"If I ever do may God forgive me," replied Ben,
poignantly.</p>
<p>"Ben, I know your secret, and I think Ina knows, too," went on
Hettie, earnestly. "We are dear friends--nay, we're sisters.
She's so good--so lovable. . . . We have talked often. You
remember when Ina came home from college--when you were a poor
wild-horse hunter of the hills and father almost hated
you--remember how Ina and I plotted for you and Nevada. How we
fought for you!"</p>
<p>"Ah, Hettie--I do remember," said Ben, dreamily.</p>
<p>"Well, Ina and I know what ails you. It's loss of your pard,
Nevada!"</p>
<p>"No, Hettie dear, <i>not</i> all loss of mine," burst out Ben,
passionately. "I'm not so selfish as that. I could stand loss.
But what has grieved and shamed me--and, well, broken my
heart--is that Nevada saved me, made all my good fortune, my
happiness, possible, by sacrificing himself. Father forgave me,
took me back home to mother and you. Hart Blaine was proud to
give me--<i>me,</i> the lonely wild-horse hunter--his talented
and beautiful daughter, the richest girl in all this valley of
rich ranchers. I had fame, family, home, love, happiness beyond
belief. Then father died, leaving me rich. I should say leaving
us rich, for half of all this wonderful ranch is yours, Hettie.
Next little Blaine came to bless me--my boy! . . . And Nevada
went back to where he came from. God only knows where that is.
I've spent a lot of money searching the West for a lean-faced
rider who drawled his Texas accent--and answered to the name
Nevada. And I can't find him."</p>
<p>"Some day you will, Ben," she whispered, thrillingly.</p>
<p>"Always I believed I would," went on Ben, whose tongue, once
loosed, seemed in haste to unburden itself. "I lived on that
hope. But it's four years now. Four years. And that Forlorn River
Ranch of ours is now worth a fortune. Half of that is Nevada's.
Half of the Mule Deer Flat Ranch is Nevada's. He's worth money. .
. . Why didn't he come back? The whole country rose up to bless
him for killing Less Setter and his two accomplices. Why didn't
he ever write? Just a line--a word to let me know he was alive
and hadn't forgotten. Oh, damn him--damn him!"</p>
<p>"Hush--Ben," returned Hettie, almost faltering. "You don't
mean to damn Nevada. . . . Don't you understand that the reason
he disappeared like that, and became as one dead to you, was not
because he feared the law might hold him for killing those wicked
men who had trapped you. No! But because he feared we would find
out who he really was. Oh, I know, Ben. That was it. Nevada had
been bad. How bad I dare not imagine. . . . Don't you remember
that day when he rode so furiously into the crowd to face Setter?
How the mere sight of him froze them with terror. . . . Oh, Ben,
I fear Nevada had been some great and terrible gunman. . . . That
gentle, soft-voiced boy who was afraid to touch me with his
little finger! Oh, the mystery, the pity of it!"</p>
<p>"Gunman?" queried Ben, almost harshly. "I reckon so. I think I
guessed it, he was so strange with guns. He handled a gun so
marvellously. But what was that to me? . . . He could be Billy
the Kid, or Plummer, or Wess Hardin, or Kingfisher, or Jim Lacy,
or any other desperado I ever heard the name of--and what would I
care?"</p>
<p>"Ben, dear, you quite overlooked something," rejoined Hettie,
bravely, while she felt the hot blood mount to cheek and temple.
"Nevada loved not only you--but me too . . . and I--I loved
him."</p>
<p>"Well, now, Hettie," replied Ben, strangely softened, "I
reckon that's no news, though you never declared it so--so
openly. But even though that was true, why should it make such a
difference?"</p>
<p>"The boy came of a good family," replied Hettie. "He had fine
instincts. And one of them was an instinct to disappear when
there was danger of my learning who he really was. There can be
no other reason. He had pride. And he loved me so--so well, he
couldn't bear to shame me."</p>
<p>"Damn him, anyway!" burst out Ben, again. "He's broken your
heart, too."</p>
<p>"Not yet," replied Hettie, in strong vibrating tones.</p>
<p>"Hettie, did that son-of-a-gun make love to you?" queried Ben,
struggling with his resentment and remorse.</p>
<p>"Did--he?" murmured she, with a little broken laugh. "Ben,
when he found out I cared--he--he made the most terrible love to
me. . . . Oh, I can never forget--never get over it!"</p>
<p>"Well!" ejaculated her brother, amazed out of his own pain.
"How and when did he ever get the chance?"</p>
<p>"Wouldn't you like to know?" asked Hettie, archly.</p>
<p>"And you--my little sixteen-year-old sister! . . . Who can
ever tell about a girl?"</p>
<p>"Ben, didn't Ina Blaine love <i>you</i> when she was five
years old--and ten--and fourteen?" queried Hettie. "And at
eighteen after she'd been away from you four years?"</p>
<p>"Thank the Lord, she did. I've never begun to understand it.
But it's beautiful, wonderful. . . . Did my pard, Nevada, ever
know you, too, had that strange, glorious thing--woman's
love--for him?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Nevada knew," replied Hettie, eloquently. "He knew he
had my faith, too. . . . And, Ben, <i>that</i> is why I've never
lost him. I know. It's the way a woman feels. Nevada is not dead.
He is not false to me--to what I believed he had become. And
somewhere, somehow, he will come back to me--to us."</p>
<p>"My God! that's good to hear!" exclaimed Ben, with fervent
emotion. "You strike me right in the heart, Hettie."</p>
<p>"I'm glad. I've wanted to speak for long," replied Hettie,
simply. "And there's another thing that touches us closely."</p>
<p>"What's that?" he asked, anxiously, as she gazed solemnly up
at him, and hesitated.</p>
<p>"Mother is failing. Haven't you noticed it?"</p>
<p>Ben nodded his head sorrowfully. "I reckon I try not to see,
but I do."</p>
<p>"She has brightened up since spring came," went on Hettie.
"Mother loves the sun, the trees, the flowers, the birds. She
likes to be outdoors. Winter is long and cold here. It rains and
snows and sleets. She dreads the icy wind. Honestly, Ben, I don't
think it's grief for father. She has gotten over that. I believe
this valley is bad for her. It's bad for me, too, in winter."</p>
<p>"I've been afraid of that very thing," declared her brother,
thoughtfully. "But there's a possibility of some organic
disease."</p>
<p>"Mother's not old," said Hettie. "She ought to live many years
yet. But we must do something to help her. Ben, I suggest you
take her to San Francisco. Get the opinion and advice of some
up-to-date physician. Take Ina with you. Blaine will be safe with
me. I'll run the ranch, never fear."</p>
<p>"By George! it's a great idea," declared Ben, with amazing
enthusiasm. He leaped down off the corral fence, then turned to
help Hettie. "Ina will be tickled. She'll get her brother Marvie
to stay with you."</p>
<p>"Ben, I actually believe you've decided already," replied
Hettie, suddenly feeling radiant.</p>
<p>"Reckon I have, and I'll bet you Ina squeals with joy. Let's
go tell her this minute."</p>
<p>Hettie peeped through the corral fence at California Red.</p>
<p>"Good-by, you beautiful, stand-off wild thing!" she cried.
"Some day some one will come and he'll tame you to eat out of my
hand."</p>
<p>With arms locked, Hettie and Ben hurried down the lane, eager
with the import of new hopes, happier than they had been for a
long time. It was Ben now who talked, while Hettie kept silent.
She thrilled with the consciousness that she had roused Ben from
a creeping sad abstraction that had grown more noticeable of
late. Ben not only missed his old friend, Nevada, but also the
wild-horse-hunting life which had been his sole occupation for
years before his marriage, and which had been the cause of the
alienation from his father.</p>
<p>Ina was in the yard, gathering violets, which certainly
matched the blue of her spring dress and the color of her eyes.
Little Blaine babbled at sight of his father and ran as fast as
his short fat legs could carry him.</p>
<p>"Well, good-mawnin', you-all!" said Ina, gayly. "Say, you look
excited." . . . Then she kissed Hettie and continued, "Many
happy, happy returns of the day."</p>
<p>Ben snatched the boy up and, holding him on his arm, he
confronted Ina with a smile that held great portent.</p>
<p>"How soon can you get ready for a trip to San Francisco?" he
asked, quite naturally, as if he were in the habit of speaking so
every day.</p>
<p>"What! Oh, I knew something was up," she cried, the color
flashing to her beautiful face. "How soon? . . . Fifteen
minutes!"</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! I thought you'd hit the saddle and ride that idea
pronto," said Ben, happily. "But you needn't be so swift as
that."</p>
<p>"Ben, are you really going to take me to Frisco?" asked Ina,
eagerly.</p>
<p>"Yes. It's all settled. But--"</p>
<p>"You darling," she cried, kissing him. "I wanted to go
somewhere. The winter has been so long, so confining. Klamath
Falls was my hope. But San Francisco! Oh!"</p>
<p>"Ina, I'm sorry I don't think of such things," replied Ben,
ruefully. "I guess I'd fallen into a rut. You must thank
Hettie."</p>
<p>Whereupon Ina most heartily embraced Hettie, and then, coming
down to earth, she said: "Let's go in to breakfast. You can tell
me there all about this grand idea."</p>
<p>"We'll tell you now," said Ben. "The trip to Frisco is on
mother's account and we mustn't discuss it before her. The fact
is, Ina, mother is failing. Something wrong with her. Hettie
suggested we take her to San Francisco to see a competent
physician. Blaine will be safe with Hettie and so will the ranch.
What do you say, dearest?"</p>
<p>"I say it's a happy and wise suggestion," returned Ina, with a
nod of commendation toward Hettie. "This damp cold Tule Lake does
not agree with mother."</p>
<p>The only hitch in the plans formulated by Ben and Hettie
concerned the coming of Marvie Blaine to stay at the Ide ranch.
Hart Blaine would not allow his son to go.</p>
<p>"That boy can't run a mowin' machine, let alone a ranch," old
Blaine had said to Ben.</p>
<p>There was trouble between Marvie and his father, for which, in
Ben's opinion, both were equally to blame.</p>
<p>"Sure reminds me of my scrap with dad," remarked Ben to
Hettie. "Only <i>I</i> was right and dad was wrong. Marvie
refused to go to college. Reckon he's not so different from me.
He likes horses and the open country."</p>
<p>"Some day Marvie will run off just as you did, Ben Ide,"
Hettie had answered.</p>
<p>So Hettie was left alone in the Ide homestead with little
Blaine and the two women servants. She rather welcomed the
solitude. She found how much her mother had taken of time and
thought. Part of the day she had the servants take care of Blaine
while she devoted herself to the many set tasks at hand and the
new ones always arising. After supper, when Blaine had been put
to bed, she had hours to be alone and think before her own rest
claimed her.</p>
<p>The running of the ranch had at first seemed something that
would be pleasure, rather than work. She discovered presently
that it was not only work, but an extremely embarrassing and
exasperating task. There were eighteen hands employed on the lake
ranch, and as many more out in the hills. Most of these employees
were young men of the valley, unmarried, and very desirous of
changing that state of single blessedness. Some had been
schoolmates of Hettie's. And there were several riders, long,
lean, rangy fellows from the South, with whom Hettie grew most
annoyed. They continually found reasons to ride in to the ranch.
Some of the excuses were ridiculous in the extreme. These droll
boys of the open range paid court to her, wholly oblivious of her
rebuffs. In two weeks' time the whole contingent was in love with
Hettie or trying to make her believe so. And the plowing, the
planting, the movement of stock, the hauling of supplies, the
herding of cattle, in fact all tasks pertaining to the operation
of Ben Ide's ranches, had to be talked over elaborately with the
temporary mistress.</p>
<p>Hettie had fun out of it, except in the case of the several
lean-faced, quiet-eyed riders from the hills. They made love to
her. Moreover, they reminded her of Nevada, and that inflamed her
lonely, hungry heart.</p>
<p>If Nevada had come to mind often in the past, what did he do
now but haunt every hour? She saw him in every one of the range
riders. Yet how incomparably he bestrode a horse! Hettie saw his
lean, fine still face, so clean cut and brown, with the sleepy
eyes that yet could wake to flame and also smile with a light she
had never seen in any other. His old black sombrero, with bullet
holes in the crown, when laid aside had appeared a disreputable
thing, but on his head it had seemed picturesque and beautiful.
His old silk scarf with the checks of red, the yellow vest with
the string of a little tobacco pouch always hanging out of a
pocket, the worn leather wristbands, the high top-boots with
their scalloped edges, and their long bright jingling spurs--how
well she remembered them, how vividly they were limned in the eye
of her memory! Then, as something inevitable at the end of
reminiscence, something that seemed an inseparable part of
Nevada, she recalled the dark and heavy gun he had always worn.
It had bumped against her as she walked beside him. When he had
taken her in his arms, even in the sweet madness of that moment,
she had felt the gun hard and cold against her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The years had brought Hettie stronger and deeper love for
Nevada. As she looked back now she remembered her open aversion
to his gun, and to the something about him that hinted of its
deadly use. She had been a callow, sentimental girl, sickened at
the thought of bloodshed, hostile toward the spirit and skill
that had eventually saved her brother from ruin and perhaps
herself from the villainous Setter.</p>
<p>She had lived and suffered during the four years since Nevada
had ridden away, leaving death and calamity behind him. She was a
woman now. She saw differently. She divined what she had been to
him--how her friendship and love had uplifted him. How great and
enduring had her own love become! She was his alone. Separation
could never change her.</p>
<p>"What did it matter who Nevada was or what he was before he
came to Ben and me?" she mused, sitting by the open window in the
dark, listening to the last sleepy honks of wild geese and the
melancholy peep-peep of spring frogs. "But he could not see that.
Yet he must have known it would not matter to me, so long as he
kept himself the Nevada we knew and loved. . . . Would he ever
fall to rustling cattle, if that had once been his crime? No!
Would he ever drink again? No! Could he sink to the embrace of
some bad woman? Never! . . . Will he use again that terrible gun?
. . . Ah, he <i>will!</i> I feel it. If not for himself, then for
some one. . . . He was flame and lightning to destroy!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c06" id="c06">SIX</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Hettie's folk did not return from San Francisco on the date
they had specified, nor did she receive any letter from them.
Every day thereafter she expected them, only to be disappointed.
This, added to the increasing perplexity of the duties that had
been left to her, and the persistence of her admirers, wore her
into such a nervous state that she failed to keep her boast about
running the ranch.</p>
<p>One day several strangers from Klamath Falls called upon
Hettie. They were business men, representing an Oregon syndicate,
who were buying up land around Tule Lake Valley. There had been
considerable speculation in that vicinity since the draining of
the lake. The Ides had received offers before, but never anything
like the one made by these men. Hettie was shrewd enough to grasp
that some situation had arisen, such as the possibility of a
railroad from Klamath Falls, to increase the value of the Ide
property enormously. She neither refused nor accepted the offer,
saying that control of the ranches was in her brother's hand. Her
amazement and gratification, however, lingered after their
departure. She scarcely ever thought of herself as sharing
equally with Ben the fortune their father had left them.</p>
<p>Hettie happened to be out on the farm somewhere when her
people returned; and upon coming back to the house, hot and dusty
and weary, what was her surprise and joy to be waylaid in the
hall by her mother and Ina. It took no second glance to see that
the little trip had been happily beneficial, especially to her
mother.</p>
<p>When they reached the sitting room, Hettie was on the verge of
tears. Sight of Ben then was too much for her, and she ran
weeping into his outstretched arms.</p>
<p>"Oh--Ben," she cried, "I--I fell down on running the ranch! .
. . The silly fools nagged me--to death!"</p>
<p>"Who?" queried Ben, suddenly aghast.</p>
<p>"The boys--and some of the men--too. They just--made my
life--miserable."</p>
<p>"Well! The lazy sons-of-guns!" ejaculated Ben. "I'll fire the
whole caboodle of them."</p>
<p>Ina's tender solicitude and Ben's anger at once calmed
Hettie.</p>
<p>"Oh no, Ben. It's not so--so bad as that. They only hatched
every pretense and excuse to approach me--just to make outrageous
love."</p>
<p>Ben's haw-haw mingled with Ina's scream of laughter. Hettie
had to accept that mirth with the best grace possible. Her
troubles were over, at last, and she could not but forgive the
suitors who had so besieged her. The high spirits of Ben and Ina
and the certain evidence of her mother's improvement were
sufficient to lift Hettie to the heights.</p>
<p>"What'd you bring me from Frisco?" she asked presently, with
all a child's eagerness.</p>
<p>"Candy," replied Ben, with a smile.</p>
<p>"A new spring dress and hat--oh, adorable," replied Ina.</p>
<p>"Well, daughter, I fetched you somethin' too," added Mrs. Ide,
beaming.</p>
<p>"I--I'm almost glad you went off and left me alone," responded
Hettie, gratefully.</p>
<p>Nothing was said during supper about the main object of the
journey to San Francisco. Ina told of their trips to the stores,
and Ben of their jaunts to seashore and parks and theaters.
Later, when Mrs. Ide had retired, Ben took Hettie into Ina's
room, where the ecstatic Blaine gloated over his new toys.</p>
<p>"Well, Hettie, your sending us off on this trip means a great
change in our lives," began Ben, gravely.</p>
<p>"Oh--Ben!" faltered Hettie.</p>
<p>Here Ina interposed to reprove Ben for his abruptness and lack
of tact. Then she added, "Hettie dear, it's nothing to frighten
you."</p>
<p>"Winter and spring are too damp and cold for mother,"
continued Ben. "To keep her here longer will endanger her
life."</p>
<p>"Then we certainly won't keep her," replied Hettie,
resolutely.</p>
<p>"Exactly. Ina and I got that far, anyway, in our
decision."</p>
<p>"Will mother--be all right in some other climate?" queried
Hettie, with hesitation.</p>
<p>"She'll get well," answered Ben. "She needs a mild, dry, warm
climate in winter and a high, dry, bracing climate in
summer."</p>
<p>"Where can we find them?"</p>
<p>"Easy enough. But the thing that stumps Ina and me is how to
decide what's best to do."</p>
<p>"That's easy enough," returned Hettie. "I will go with mother
and live with her."</p>
<p>"Sure you will. But that doesn't solve the problem."</p>
<p>"Surely we can afford it, Ben?"</p>
<p>"I reckon. However, the point is I don't want to be separated
from mother and you. Neither does Ina. That much is settled. We
won't be separated."</p>
<p>Hettie gazed with suddenly dim eyes at her brother. He and Ina
felt what she had not spoken. They were both in dead earnest, and
Ina's color had faded. Evidently they had talked this thing over,
to a conclusion that was momentous.</p>
<p>"Ben, you can't imagine how happy you make me," said Hettie,
feelingly. "Separation would be hard. I have only mother and you
and yours to live for. . . . Then, if you won't let mother and me
leave you . . ."</p>
<p>"We've sure got to go with you," interrupted Ben, forcibly.
"But what to do is sure a sticker."</p>
<p>"Sell--out!" said Hettie, huskily.</p>
<p>"But we've lived here all our lives. This land has made us
prosperous. It's home."</p>
<p>"Ben, it'd not be home without mother."</p>
<p>"No. And it wouldn't be the same if we were all separated. But
I'd hate to sacrifice the land just to get a quick sale. And
we'll need money, wherever we go."</p>
<p>"Ben, I can sell this lake property of ours for two hundred
thousand," declared Hettie.</p>
<p>Her brother stared at her. At length he spoke: "Hettie, don't
make wild statements like that. It's hard enough on me to make
decisions."</p>
<p>"I can sell for that <i>to-morrow,"</i> grandly added Hettie,
conscious of a sudden tremendous importance.</p>
<p>"Now I know she's crazy," wailed Ben, turning to his wife.</p>
<p>"She looks pretty sure and sane to me, Bennie boy. You're only
a wild-horse hunter, anyway. Hettie and I have the business
brains."</p>
<p>"By George!" cried Ben, leaping up. "You're right. But I can't
believe we could sell for that."</p>
<p>"It's true, Ben. Listen," said Hettie, and then briefly told
about the offer of the Klamath Falls syndicate.</p>
<p>"Horses not included in the deal? Not California Red?" queried
Ben, beginning to manifest signs of extreme excitement.</p>
<p>"Their offer embraced land and buildings on this ranch, and
all the Ide cattle. But not horses."</p>
<p>"Girls, it's settled, it's done!" cried Ben, giving way to the
force of something that had been impelling him. He kissed Ina and
hugged Hettie. He tore up and down the room. He woke little
Blaine, who had fallen asleep on the bed amid his toys.</p>
<p>"Ben, aren't you ashamed? All that show of gladness over
selling our home!" exclaimed Ina, reproachfully.</p>
<p>Hettie did not voice her surprise and disapproval. She had not
seen Ben show excitement like that for years. What did it
mean?</p>
<p>Ben ceased his violent expressions and faced them, quite pale,
with his dark eyes full of fire.</p>
<p>"Forgive me and try to understand," he said. "Remember I have
not the tender associations with Tule Lake that actuate you
girls. It is home and I reckon I love it, but not as you. Father
was hard on me for years. He made me an outcast. For years more I
lived over there across the sage hills, hunting wild horses,
lonely and wretched. Then Nevada dropped into my life. Then, Ina,
you came, too. . . . And so between you I was brought home again.
But despite all, there has been something lacking. . . . This
ranch country is too populated for me. It is too rich. There's
not enough hard work for me. The sage hills and the valleys, once
so wild, where the horses roamed free, are now ranches and farms.
I'd be happier in a new country--say in Arizona, where the ranges
are vast and ranches few. I'd do better, working as I used to. .
. . That's why I'm glad to sell out here, to take mother where
she'll get strong again, where you all will be the happier
because of these things."</p>
<p>"Arizona? Ben, you didn't tell me you'd decided," expostulated
Ina.</p>
<p>"I hadn't until now. Hettie settled it, bless her heart."</p>
<p>"Arizona!" murmured Hettie, thoughtfully. "We know so little
about Arizona. Isn't it very wild?"</p>
<p>"Wild? I reckon," replied Ben. "Arizona is everything northern
California used to be. Then it has vast grass and sage ranges,
desert and valley, canyons and mountains, great forests, great
rivers. There are thousands of wild horses in Arizona. Deer,
bear, lion, turkey--wonderful hunting. It has minerals--gold,
silver, copper. There's just been war between cattlemen and
sheepmen. Oh, it is a wonderful country for the pioneer."</p>
<p>"Hettie," added Ina, "we met an Arizonian in Frisco, a
grizzled old fellow. I wish you could have seen him. He surely
was full of Arizona. But Ben didn't tell you all."</p>
<p>"What'd I forget?" inquired Ben, lamely.</p>
<p>"About the bad crews who live off the ranchers--Indians,
Mexicans, rustlers, horse thieves, wild cowboys, gunmen--and I
don't remember who else. That plan of Arizona worries me, Ben, if
you must go there."</p>
<p>"It'd worry me, too, if I thought I'd fall into such company
as the old Arizonian bragged about. But he was only blowing. . .
. At that, though, I think I could stand a few wild cowboys.
Couldn't you, Hettie?"</p>
<p>He spoke teasingly and laughed with something of his old
boyishness. Verily this possibility of Arizona had stimulated
him.</p>
<p>Hettie tried to smile, but her effort was a wan one. There had
seemed to come a knocking at her heart.</p>
<p>"I'll keep Forlorn River Ranch and Mule Deer Flat," mused Ben,
pacing the room. "I'd never part with them. We own them, Nevada
and I, share and share alike. . . . Some day I'll come back to
see them, and who knows?"</p>
<p>Hettie lay sleepless and distracted late into the hours of the
night.</p>
<p>She could not tell whether she wanted to weep or rejoice.
Ben's revelation had not been such a surprise, though the
violence of his feeling dismayed her. Despite all that wealth,
home, wife, child could give Ben, he yearned for the old free
life in the open, for his lean-faced beloved friend, for the
color of the sage and the movement of wild horses on the horizon.
How he had welcomed this opportunity to get away from Tule Lake!
And Ina was as wise as she was loving. Her home was where her
heart abided. That night she had followed Hettie to her room to
say: "Hettie, we didn't guess how it was with Ben. And I want to
ask you, don't you think this change will be as good for Ben's
soul as for mother's health?"</p>
<p>"I do indeed, Ina," Hettie had replied. "Ben was a strange
boy, even when he was little. Father never understood him."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll be happy with Ben anywhere," returned Ina, simply.
"My folks will make a fuss about this. They'll be shocked to hear
we are going back to the pioneer life in far-away Arizona. Money
has made snobs of my people, except Marvie. He's eighteen now,
and as wild to hunt and fish and ride as when he used to run away
to Forlorn River. He just worshiped Ben and Nevada. He and dad
are at odds now. I wonder how our going will effect Marvie?"</p>
<p>"Ina, you needn't wonder," said Hettie. "That boy will go with
us."</p>
<p>"Oh, if he only could!" sighed Ina. "But dad would rave at the
very idea."</p>
<p>"Marvie will run off," declared Hettie, positively.</p>
<p>Whenever Hettie's thoughts wandered back to herself, she
wanted to weep. There was regret, of course, mingled with the
emotions roused by the thought of leaving Tule Lake, where she
had lived all her life. But not regret was it that threatened to
bring the tears. Rather a joy rising from the depths of her! The
old oppressive certainty that Nevada would never come back to
Forlorn River was now lifted from her heart. She would no longer
eat her heart out in waiting. Over there in wild Arizona she
might see him again. Ben would never cease to search for Nevada.
Surely he would locate him some day. How Ben loved that comrade
of his lonely Forlorn River days!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ben was late at breakfast next morning. No one had to tell
Hettie and Ina that he had been out to the corrals. He strode in
more like his old self than for months, keen-eyed, virile, with
the spring of a rider in his step.</p>
<p>"Say, girls, what do you think?" he declared, radiantly. "Red
came to me this morning. The wild son-of-a-gun! He did, and it
sure tickled me. And I said to him, 'Old boy, you're going back
to the unfenced ranges.' He understood me, too. . . . Oh,
Ina--Hettie, I'm another man this mawnin'!"</p>
<p>"You look it, Bennie," replied Ina, with her beautiful eyes
warm and glad.</p>
<p>"But you and Hettie look as if you'd lain awake and cried all
night."</p>
<p>"That's a way women have, sometimes," said Ina. "It's a break,
of course. But we're happy for you, and, thank God, we've found
the way to restore mother."</p>
<p>"Blaine, my boy," said Ben, leaning to the child in his
highchair, "we're going to Arizona. Are you glad?"</p>
<p>"Papa happy?" replied Blaine, with big-eyed, questioning
wonder.</p>
<p>"Well, there's a bright youngster," declared Ben, raising his
head to smile at Ina.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ide came in at the moment, to take her place next to
Hettie. "What's that I hear about Arizona?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing much, mother," laughed Ben. "I was teasing Blaine
about Arizona."</p>
<p>"Reckon you're full of Arizona since you met that cattleman,"
rejoined Mrs. Ide, placidly. "I didn't think much of him. He was
as rough as the country he bragged about."</p>
<p>"Nana, we's doan Ar-zoonie," chirped up little Blaine, with
great importance.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ide had not until that moment been given any inkling of
the secret.</p>
<p>"Land's sake!" she ejaculated. "So that's the mystery. . . .
Ben Ide, you ain't goin' back to chasin' wild hosses? Your father
would turn over in his grave."</p>
<p>Ben Ide was not noted for deception or beating round the bush.
Despite warning glances from Hettie and a kick under the table
from Ina he told his mother that he was thinking of selling out
and moving to Arizona. Mrs. Ide declared she would never go or
permit Hettie to leave home. Ben tried to expostulate with her
and, failing that, tried to laugh it off. But when his mother
asked him a deliberate question he maintained silence. Whereupon
she rose from the table and, weeping, left the room.</p>
<p>"Blaine, I reckon you're not such a bright kid, after all,"
said Ben, ruefully.</p>
<p>"It was a shock, Ben," rejoined Ina. "You were so abrupt. But
she'll come round to it all right."</p>
<p>"Leave mother to us," added Hettie.</p>
<p>They talked it over, and at the conclusion of breakfast both
Ina and Hettie urged Ben, now that he had made the great
decision, to proceed at once toward its fulfillment.</p>
<p>"I'll run over to tell mother and dad," said Ina. "They'd
never forgive me if I didn't tell them first. Maybe they'll not
forgive me, anyway. . . . And Marvie! I'll bet he lets out a
whoop."</p>
<p>"By George!" ejaculated Ben. "Marvie will want to come with
us. Ina, it's a big chance for the boy."</p>
<p>"I believe it is, Ben," she replied.</p>
<p>"Well, there's something sort of tough about this deal," went
on Ben. "Yet it's great, too. . . . I'll go to Klamath Falls
today. Reckon the papers will require your signature, Hettie.
Say, what're you going to do with all that money?"</p>
<p>"What money?" queried Hettie, blankly.</p>
<p>"Why, ninny, your share in the Ide property!"</p>
<p>"Goodness! I never thought of that in money. Ben, I'll want
the same share in your Arizona ranch."</p>
<p>"Good. You're one sister in a million. I'll leave you to talk
some sense into mother, and you, Ina, to do the same by your
folks. Reckon that'll be leaving you a job, because you and
Marvie have all the sense in the Blaine family."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ben left early for Klamath and Hettie had her hands full, not
only with her mother, but with the ranch boys and riders among
whom the news spread like wildfire in dry grass. Ben had not been
any more tactful than usual. But then, Hettie reflected, since
everybody had to know, what difference did it make whether they
were told sooner or later?</p>
<p>Hettie told nine boys, one after the other, that Ben had not
been joking, and that the Ide ranch was to pass into strange
hands. Each and every one of these ranch hands was visibly
agitated at the news.</p>
<p>"Miss Hettie," said one, "I reckon we ain't carin' what
becomes of Tule Lake Ranch, but we care an awful lot about what
becomes of you an' the boss. You can't get along without us."</p>
<p>"Oh, I wish Ben would take you all," replied Hettie, half
distracted.</p>
<p>Then she had a long and trying hour with her mother, who, of
course, could not be told the most important reason for this
breaking of old home ties. But Hettie knew how to handle her
mother, and with patience and common sense, and dwelling much on
the need of a change for Ben, she at last won the victory.</p>
<p>"After all, Hettie, it doesn't--matter about me," concluded
Mrs. Ide, weeping. "But you'll be marryin' one of them
long-legged, long-haired Arizona jacks, like that terrible
Nevada."</p>
<p>"Why, mother, what a happy thought!" exclaimed Hettie, with a
divine blush. "I might be just that lucky."</p>
<p>Ina, however, did not have such success with her folks. She
returned both with fire in her eyes and with traces of tears on
her cheeks.</p>
<p>"Oh, Hettie, they were just horrid," she said. "Kate was
there, too, and you know she hates me. Dad was idiot enough to
suggest that I come back to live with him. And Kate said I'd
never need any more pretty dresses and hats out in that wild,
woolly Arizona. My clothes always stuck in Kate's craw. But
Marvie. Oh, he was adorable! In front of dad he never batted an
eye. Once outside, though, he nearly hugged the breath out of me.
'Come with you?' he shouted, so loud I was afraid they'd hear.
'By the great jumpin' horn of Jehosaphat, I'm comin'! Dad can't
stop me. Nor ropes, nor jails! I'll ride for Ben, an' chase wild
horses, an' hunt an' fish. . . . Who knows, I might see Nevada
out there.'"</p>
<p>"Bless the boy's heart!" exclaimed Hettie, her eyes filling
with tears.</p>
<p>"Strange how Ben and Marvie loved Nevada," mused Ina.</p>
<p>"Strange?" queried Hettie, smiling through her tears.</p>
<p>"No. I don't mean that. . . . I think I loved him, too."</p>
<p>"Well, Ina, we've broken the ice," rejoined Hettie, quickly
changing the subject. "Mother made a fuss, but I won her over.
Your folks will have to come round, whether they like it or not.
Now we must get our heads together. Ben will think of taking you
and Blaine, and us, and his horses. That's all. But you know
there are many things he can't part with. What a job it will be!
How will we travel?"</p>
<p>"Goodness! I hope Ben doesn't make us ride horseback or in
tent-covered wagons," replied Ina. That'd be just like him."</p>
<p>"It'd be fun, once we got started," said Hettie, dreamily.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c07" id="c07">SEVEN</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Three days later the Ides stood on their front porch and
watched a buckboard drawn by a spirited team of horses rapidly
passing down the lane toward the main road. This vehicle
contained Ben's lawyer and a representative of the Oregon
syndicate. Ben held a certified check in his hand, for which he
had signed away the broad fertile acres of Tule Lake Ranch. He
had also agreed to turn over the property before the first of
September.</p>
<p>"By George! It happened quick!" he exclaimed, breathing hard.
"Ina--Hettie--we're homeless."</p>
<p>"Ben, if it hurts you to lose this ranch, how will you ever
give up Forlorn River?" asked Hettie, wonderingly.</p>
<p>"I'm sure keeping Forlorn River," declared Ben, but he winced
perceptibly. "That reminds me, I'll have to ride out there."</p>
<p>"I'll go with you," said Hettie.</p>
<p>"Me, too," added Ina. "Reckon you-all haven't any corner on
love for old Forlorn River."</p>
<p>"Honest, girls, I'd rather go alone," returned Ben.</p>
<p>"We won't intrude on your grief, Bennie dear," smiled Ina.</p>
<p>"I stopped over in Hammell on my way back from Oregon," said
Ben. "You remember Sheriff Strobel. He always was a friend of
mine, even in those outcast days when I was suspected of being a
rustler. Strobel knows a good deal about Arizona. I asked him to
come out this afternoon. I'll sure take what he says pretty
serious."</p>
<p>"Now that we've burned our bridges behind us, it's late to ask
advice," said Hettie.</p>
<p>"Yes, as far as going is concerned," agreed Ben. "But about
<i>where</i> to go--that's another matter. Arizona is a big
place."</p>
<p>No wonder, thought Hettie, that Ben wanted to consult some one
who was familiar with Arizona. She had begun to realize the
responsibility of their undertaking. Therefore she was quite as
eager to hear Sheriff Strobel as Ben; and Ina, too, did not want
to be excluded from the interview.</p>
<p>They sat out on the shady porch, and while little Blaine
played on the grass they explained to Ben's old friend the
exigencies of the case.</p>
<p>"Wal, if you've sold out an' have got to go, there ain't no
use advisin' ag'in' it," replied Strobel. "I reckon it's a pity.
Folks around will miss you-all. . . . But what'd you pick out
Arizona for, of all places?"</p>
<p>"Arizona has the climate. The doctor recommended it," said
Ben.</p>
<p>"Wal, Arizona sure has a lot of climate," admitted Strobel.
"There ain't no gainsayin' that. But climate is the only
<i>good</i> thing it has got. The rest is desert, rocks, cactus,
Gila monsters, an' tarantulas, side-winders, bad varmints,
greasers, rustlers, an' gun-throwers."</p>
<p>"That's the worst I've heard yet," returned Ben, regretfully.
"Are you giving Arizona a square deal?"</p>
<p>"Wal, after all, it's a wonderful country," replied the
sheriff, as if forced to make a concession. "I went there twice,
first time in the early days of the Territory, an' second about
two years ago. Outside of the Indians bein' quiet, I didn't see
much difference. Of late, hard characters have slipped into
Arizona from all over."</p>
<p>"I've heard that," said Ben, impatiently. "It's about all
anyone seems to say. What I want help in is where to strike
for."</p>
<p>"Reckon I don't know enough about Arizona to tell you that.
I'm able, though, to give you some hunches about where <i>not</i>
to go. Southern Arizona is too hot, an' in the north it's too
cold. On the other hand, you want to steer clear of the Tonto
Basin, the Sierra Ancas, the Mogollons, the Little Colorado
country. Around Springerville an' Snowflake there's fine grazin'
lands. That's near the White Mountains. But Mormons mostly have
settled in there. The Santa Fé Railroad has just lately been laid
across Arizona. An' all along the line new ranches have been
added to the few settlers that were there. Anyone goin' into the
cattle game on a big scale, as of course you will, don't want to
get too far from the railroad. I'd say a hundred miles should be
the limit, an' that's too far, in Arizona. Roughest, wildest
country on earth, I reckon. . . . Now, Ben, the only advice I'll
presume to give you is this. Have a winter home in San Diego,
California. There's the mildest, most equable climate in all the
world. That's the place for your mother an' for all of you. San
Diego is not so far from southern and central Arizona. By doin'
so you can pick the best range land in Arizona, an' needn't worry
so much about winter climate. Some of them high plateaus get
plumb cold in winter, but are grand all the rest of the
year."</p>
<p>"By George! that's a good idea," exclaimed Ben,
enthusiastically. "Never thought of that myself. I've heard about
San Diego. It's on the seashore near the Mexican border. They say
the sun shines there every day in the year. By George!--it solves
our problem, Ina."</p>
<p>"I like the idea very much indeed," replied Ina.</p>
<p>"How about you, Hettie?" queried Ben, eagerly.</p>
<p>"It would appeal to mother," said Hettie. "She's a little
hipped on this wild and woolly Arizona, as your San Francisco
informant called it."</p>
<p>"Sheriff, you sure have given me a hunch," declared Ben,
turning to his friend. "Now, about my horses. You know I'd never
go anywhere without Red and some of the others. But why not take
the best of my stock?"</p>
<p>"Wal, by all means take them," replied the sheriff. "That's a
hoss country, an' also a hoss-<i>thief</i> country. I'd send them
overland by easy stages in care of some reliable men. Send a
chuck wagon, an' also another wagon, so they can haul outfits an'
plenty of grain. An', Ben, I'd start them soon as possible.
They'll need time. They got to cross Nevada an' most of Utah.
That depends on the best route, which they'll have to find."</p>
<p>"Exactly. The main thing, though, is an objective point. Where
shall my men go in Arizona?"</p>
<p>"Wal, that is a stumper," replied the other. "Here it's well
along in May now. You said you'd agree to vacate this range in
about two months."</p>
<p>"Yes. But, come to think of it, that's just prolonging the
agony. . . . Girls, how about it? Couldn't you get out of here in
two <i>weeks?"</i></p>
<p>"Oh dear!" cried Hettie, helpless before this rush of events
and the wonderful stir it roused.</p>
<p>"Yes, Ben, we could. The sooner the better," replied Ina,
wide-eyed with the seriousness of this decision.</p>
<p>"Good!" ejaculated Ben. "Then I'll go with the horses. You can
pack what you want to take, send it to Klamath to be freighted.
Then you and Hettie can fetch Blaine and mother by way of
Frisco."</p>
<p>"They can take the Santa Fé from Los Angeles," interposed the
sheriff.</p>
<p>"And be landed somewhere in wild Arizona to wait weeks for
you," asserted Ina.</p>
<p>"Ben, if you go overland I'm going with you," added Hettie,
spiritedly.</p>
<p>"We'll <i>all</i> go with you," added Ina, a spot of red
showing in each pearly cheek.</p>
<p>"Aw, girls, that'll never do," expostulated Ben. "It's--it's a
crazy idea."</p>
<p>"We could stand it," returned Ina, gathering courage with the
growing conception. "I think we'd have fun. Back to the pioneer
days! Remember how our mothers used to brag about the wagon-team
into Oregon?"</p>
<p>"It would be great," added Hettie, in low voice, and she felt
her breast heave.</p>
<p>"Say, you're laying it on thick," declared Ben, at his wits'
end. Plain it was he had at once set his heart upon riding
overland. "You girls might do it, but think of Blaine and
mother."</p>
<p>"Mother would not only like it, but she could go through with
it," said Hettie, jumping up. "I'll ask her."</p>
<p>She ran in to lay the point before her mother.</p>
<p>"Well, daughter," came the reply, with unusual animation,
"reckon that's the first sensible idea Ben has thought of, if it
did come from him. It'd do me good. Work an' livin' outdoors is
what I need."</p>
<p>Hettie rushed outside triumphantly to announce her mother's
opinion, at which Ben threw up his hands.</p>
<p>"I'll have to give up that plan," he said, regretfully.</p>
<p>Whereupon he took the sheriff off for the corrals, leaving
Hettie and Ina deep in a discussion of this important phase of
their exodus into a new country. On Blaine's behalf, Ina could
not see any reason why he should be a deterrent. And Hettie found
innumerable arguments in favor of the overland journey.</p>
<p>"We can pack a wagonload of trunks and chests and boxes with
the things most dear to us, and ship the rest," averred Ina.
"It'd be a safer way."</p>
<p>Hettie agreed wholly with Ina on the economic and practical
aspects of the matter, and did not slight the romance, or the
adventure side. In the end they convinced each other that the
overland journey was the one they wanted to take.</p>
<p>"Leave Ben to me," concluded Ina.</p>
<p>"Oh, what will Marvie say to this?" added Hettie, with shining
eyes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As Hettie had suspected, her brother was not so easy to
persuade as Ina had confidently anticipated. During the two days
of this deadlock the affairs of the ranch went topsy-turvy. What
time Ben was not listening and gradually weakening to Ina's
importunities he lounged around the corrals, not in a very
approachable mood.</p>
<p>At daylight on the third morning Ben pounded on Hettie's
door.</p>
<p>"Wake up!" he shouted, gayly. "You'll make a fine wife for a
pioneer."</p>
<p>"Oh, Ben, what's the matter?" cried Hettie, sitting up in
alarm.</p>
<p>"Roll out. There's work to do, young lady."</p>
<p>"Are you--have you--" faltered Hettie.</p>
<p>"I reckon. We leave June first," he replied, deep-voiced.</p>
<p>"Overland?"</p>
<p>"Sure. And Marvie goes with us. Ina's father was pretty
decent, for him. Agreed to let Marvie come with us for a year, on
trial. I had to give my word of honor I'd send him back if he
went wild."</p>
<p>"Marvie won't go wild--that is, not much," replied Hettie.
"Oh, I'm glad! Ina loves him best of all her family. . . . Ben,
then we're--really going?"</p>
<p>"You bet, unless you girls four-flush on me," rejoined Ben,
and then he thumped away down the hall with rapid stride.</p>
<p>Hettie gave a little gasp and fell back on her pillow. She
seemed suddenly weak. What a wonderful prospect, yet terrifying
for all its thrill! Before she recovered Ina came running in,
fully dressed, with wild dark eyes of radiance.</p>
<p>"Get up, you lazy girl," she said, hugging and pulling at
Hettie. "It's all settled. Ben was over home till late. I was
asleep when he got back. He woke me at four o'clock and told me
he'd decided. We're to go overland. We'll have a regular
wagon-train. Oh, I'm so excited I'm silly. . . . I believe it was
Marvie who turned the scales. He can do anything with Ben--he's
so like Nevada. Wasn't it bright of me to enlist Marvie in our
cause?"</p>
<p>"Bright? You're wonderful! The Ide outfit wouldn't be complete
without Marvie."</p>
<p>That dawn was the beginning of excited, full, strenuous days.
Hettie did not know where the hours flew. If anything inspired
her more than her own secret longing that she might meet Nevada
but in Arizona, it was the interest and enthusiasm shown by her
mother. They wasted as much time in choosing what to take as they
worked hard and late in packing. Ben sold most of the furniture
almost over their heads. As the first of June drew swiftly and
fearfully on, Hettie realized she must spare time to see a few
old school friends before she left. As it turned out, however,
they called to see her.</p>
<p>Ben bought several new, large, deep-bodied wagons, which he
had covered with canvas stretched over high hoops. One for Hettie
and her mother, and another for himself, Ina, and Blaine, he had
fitted out so that they made comfortable little rooms. What
tingling pleasure Hettie derived from climbing into her wagon,
that must be her home for weeks, possibly months! It was almost
like, when she had been a little girl, playing at keeping
house.</p>
<p>Wherefore furnishing this wagon-house proved both a joy and
problem. Hettie arranged curtains just behind the wide driver's
seat in front. The two single cots had a narrow aisle between
them, which was covered with a strip of carpet. Underneath the
cots Hettie stowed bags and boxes. At the rear of the wagon was
space enough for a low chair, a bureau with mirror, a tiny
washstand, and an improvised cloth-curtained wardrobe in which to
hang clothes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The morning of departure was like a nightmare for Hettie. But
after she had passed through Hammell, which passing was in the
nature of a parade, Hettie began to recover. Her mother lay
quietly on her cot, wearied, but not manifesting any signs of
deep grief. Hettie parted the front curtains and got out on the
high seat with the driver, one of the older men, who had worked
for the Ides as long as Hattie could remember. She did not want
to cry, and thought that outside she might better keep from
it.</p>
<p>A string of horses, mostly bays and blacks, among which
California Red shone like fire in the sun, led the cavalcade up
the long hill road. They were in charge of three of Ben's best
riders. Next came the chuck wagon, and after it the one
containing extra supplies, both of which were drawn by four
horses. Ben's wagon came third, and Hettie's last.</p>
<p>She had a powerful impulse to look back, but she resisted it
until they had passed over the hill. When at last Hettie turned
to look her eyes were so wet that she had to wipe them so she
could see. How far they had already come! The cluster of houses
that constituted the village of Hammell lay at the foot of the
long hill. Beyond widened the green valley, for miles and miles,
with its threads of bright water and its shining remnant of lake,
and the great squares of grain, waving in the wind. She located
the Ide ranch, the fields, the barns, the dark patch of maples,
the white house. Home! She was leaving it, surely forever. Yet
she whispered to herself that she was glad to go; her heart had
almost broken there; she would never return unless--unless . .
.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hettie had overestimated her powers of resistance. That one
lingering last look back at Tule Lake was her undoing. She crept
through the curtains again and sought her couch, where she hid
her face and let emotion have its sway. Following that, a
relaxation from the weeks of excitement and work set in, and she
was glad to rest and sleep. Late in the afternoon she awoke,
refreshed and calm, soon to feel a lively interest in the
present.</p>
<p>At this juncture a halt was made for the first camp. Hettie
saw that wagons and horses had stopped off the road in a level
place where gnarled oaks stood far apart and a trickling stream
wound between green banks. She walked here and there to stretch
her legs, conscious of the return of a vague delight. She had
always loved camping out, of which she had experienced but
little. This indeed was to be a real camping adventure. The
horses were rolling on the ground, in all kinds of violent action
to scratch and dust their sweaty backs. Some of the more spirited
animals were being hobbled. Ben was coaxing California Red with a
nosebag of grain. The driver of the chuck wagon, who was also the
cook, staggered under a load of firewood. Rolls of bedding were
being thrown from another wagon.</p>
<p>When Hettie got back to her wagon and Ben's, which were close
together, she found her mother, Ina, and Blaine all out, smiling
and interested. Just then Marvie Blaine strode up with an ax on
his shoulder. He was a tall, well-built youth, freckled and
homely, with fine clear eyes. He wore overalls, high boots, long
spurs, and he packed a gun. Ina espied this latter simultaneously
with Hettie.</p>
<p>"Marvie Blaine!" cried Ina, pointing at the gun. "What's
that?"</p>
<p>"Why, my six shooter, of course!" retorted Marvie, with
importance.</p>
<p>"What're you going to do with it?" queried his sister, in
consternation.</p>
<p>"Ina, I'm sure not wearing it for ornament," replied the
lad.</p>
<p>"Gracious! It might go off and hurt somebody!"</p>
<p>"Ahuh! That's the whole idea of packing a gun," replied
Marvie, and strode on.</p>
<p>"Hettie, did you hear him?" asked Ina, wide-eyed.</p>
<p>"I sure did," said Hettie, with a laugh. "Marvie's awakened to
reality."</p>
<p>"And Ben swore to dad he'd keep that boy from going wild,"
ejaculated Ina.</p>
<p>Ben, who approached on the moment, heard his wife's
exclamation, and he picked up little Blaine to toss him up and
catch him. "Ha! Ha! reckon here's another gunman in the
making."</p>
<p>"There's nothing funny about that remark," said Ina,
reproachfully.</p>
<p>Just then the cook came shuffling up to Ben, manifestly in a
high state of dudgeon.</p>
<p>"Boss, your mother says she's a-goin' to do the cookin', an'
thet I can wait on table an' wash dishes," he asserted.</p>
<p>"By George! I forgot about mother," rejoined Ben, struggling
with his mirth. "Now, Hank, that's nonsense, of course. But you
must use some tact. Mother wants to help along. Can't you let her
putter around?"</p>
<p>"Putter, hell!" sputtered Hank. "She calls me dirty an'
greasy--throws out my sour dough--an' snooks into everythin'. . .
. Now, boss, I'm a-goin' to quit."</p>
<p>"Hank, you wouldn't go back on me," returned Ben, in alarm.
"Come, I'll talk to mother."</p>
<p>When Ben had gone with the irate cook, Ina and Hettie burst
into merry peals of laughter.</p>
<p>"Hettie, I wouldn't have--missed this trip--for the world,"
said Ina.</p>
<p>"Neither would I. But I've begun to have glimmerings."</p>
<p>"Of what?" asked Ina, curiously.</p>
<p>"Of lots besides fun," replied Hettie, soberly.</p>
<p>Presently Ben returned, somewhat crestfallen. "By George!" he
said, throwing off his sombrero and pulling at his dark locks. "I
fixed it up, but I'm scared stiff. I reckon all camp cooks are
more or less rough and not very particular. It's sure fire mother
won't stand for dirt. She knows, too. I forgot she used to travel
with dad years ago. She wouldn't even consider the plan Hank and
I had agreed on--that we'd eat first, then the men. No, says
mother. Waste of time and work. We'll all eat together."</p>
<p>"That's sensible," replied Ina.</p>
<p>"I am reminded that I'm starved," interposed Hettie.</p>
<p>"I's hungry," chirped up little Blaine, from the grass.</p>
<p>"We all are, son," agreed Ben.</p>
<p>Presently they were called to supper. The picturesque
significance of that scene was vividly impressed upon Hettie--the
smoking fire, and smell of burnt wood, the steaming pots, the new
white tarpaulin spread under an oak, the hot biscuits, and
sizzling bacon with its savoury fragrance; the tall, lean,
dark-faced young riders, still in chaps and spurs; her mother,
bustling and happy as Hettie had not seen her in years; young
Marvie with his shining freckled face and conscious air; Ina,
with violent eyes alight; and the tumbling, disheveled Blaine, at
last in his element, and Ben, both gay with the zest of this
journey and thoughtful with its responsibility.</p>
<p>Then after supper came the hour beside the camp fire. As dusk
settled down and the night wind arose there were comfort and
pleasant sensation in the heat from the red logs.</p>
<p>Hettie watched and listened, conscious of a mounting interest
in all that pertained to this overland journey. The men talked
with Ben about the practical details of travel, the need of
shoeing a certain horse, the greasing of a wagon wheel, the
night-watches, and especially of the road ahead.</p>
<p>"We'll have fust-rate goin' fer a couple of days," said Raidy,
one of Ben's older hands. "I've been over this hyar road lots of
times, far as Jefferson. We turn off, howsomever, about day after
to-morrer. An' that road used to be a terror for a wagon. Over
the foothills into Nevada. But I heerd in Hammell thet it's been
improved by travel. There's new minin' towns sprung up, Salisbar
is quite a town."</p>
<p>"How about that thar border place, Lineville?" asked one of
the riders.</p>
<p>"I ain't never been there," replied Raidy. "All I know is
hearsay. Reckon it's growed, too, along with the booms. But she
shore was a wide-open town once. Not so long ago, either, as time
goes. We'll hit Lineville along late the fourth day from hyar, if
my figgerin' is correct an' we have any kind of travelin'
luck."</p>
<p>"Boss, do you aim to go through Salt Lake City?" queried
another.</p>
<p>"No. We'll strike Utah far south of Salt Lake," replied
Ben.</p>
<p>"Then we don't hit Tombstone?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure. How about that, Raidy?"</p>
<p>"We don't run into Tombstone," returned Raidy, "an' thet's
jest as well. Our trail zigzags across Nevada, workin' down. Bad
road, but passable. We go into Marysville, Utah. Thet burg is
pretty far across the line an' pretty far south. Thar's a road
from Marysville down over the line into Arizona, an' way around
to a crossin' of the Colorado called Lee's Ferry. Mormons have
been comin' across the head of the Grand Canyon thar fer years.
Reckon we can travel whar any Mormons go, though thet country is
said to be the grandest an' roughest in all the West. It'll save
us a thousand miles."</p>
<p>When Hettie retired to her wagon that night she had a clearer
realization of the tremendous task of travel Ben had set himself.
Almost it daunted her. But there came a strengthening and
enduring memory.</p>
<p>Her little tent room was as cozy and comfortable as she could
have wished. Evidently her mother had found it likewise, for she
was fast asleep. Hettie prepared herself for bed, put out the
lamp, and slipped into her blankets. The novelty and strangeness
of the situation precluded sleep for the time being. She lay
wide-eyed, staring at the flickering shadows on the canvas. After
a while the low voices of the men ceased and the firelight faded.
Black night and deep silence enfolded her. What had become of the
horses? The wind swept through the oaks, now softly and again
with a rush. She felt it blow cold through the curtains, fanning
her cheek. Then lonely sharp wild barks made her flesh creep.
Coyotes! She was on the edge of the wilderness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ben's cheery call seemed to rend Hettie's slumbers. To her
dismay, she saw the sunlight gilding the canvas and that her
mother had arisen without awakening her. Hettie made such haste
that she was not late for breakfast. The men had eaten earlier,
despite the law laid down by Mrs. Ide.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful moment when the horses came trooping in
behind the yelling riders. After that all seemed action and
noise, color and life. Breakfast over, Hettie helped in what few
tasks she could find, then made her bed and was ready for the
long day's ride. She found she had to kill time, however, while
the horses were hitched and the chuck wagon packed. So she
gathered wild flowers until Marvie rode up on her, proud as a
peacock in his chaps and mounted on one of Ben's spirited
horses.</p>
<p>"Hettie, you don't want to get left, do you?" he asked,
gruffly.</p>
<p>"I should smile not, Marvie," she replied, secretly amused at
him.</p>
<p>"Well, rustle to your wagon," he replied, and spurred his
horse away.</p>
<p>Hettie watched the lad. He could ride. "I wonder," she mused.
"Some Arizona girl will fall in love with him."</p>
<p>"Men, here's the deal," Ben was saying as Hettie reached the
wagons. "We're in no hurry. Save the horses and stick close
together. About mid-afternoon look for water and grass."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then followed days that held increasing interest for Hettie.
Once off the main road, swift progress would have been
impossible, even had Ben desired it. The road was not merely
rough, but narrow and dangerous. Yet it showed signs of
considerable travel. But they met not a wagon or horseman going
or coming.</p>
<p>The third day, while climbing the foothills Hettie grew tired
of dust and heat and the brush that continually obstructed her
view, and she sought the comfort and security of the inside of
their little canvas home. Camp was made so late that darkness had
intervened. The next day was hard, a long jolting ride downhill,
with nothing to see but rough slopes, gullies, and dust.</p>
<p>They expected to reach Lineville in time to pitch camp early,
but sunset had come and gone before they rode into a wide street
lined by strange old houses, which constituted the border town.
Hettie would have been more curious had she been less fatigued.
As it was, the place gave her a queer sensation and she would far
rather have gone on to camp in the open.</p>
<p>The wagons halted. Rough-looking men, some with picks and
packs over their shoulders, passed by with bold eyes seeking out
Hettie and Ina. Also she saw Chinamen peep from dark portals, and
tall white-faced men in black garb and high hats stare fixedly at
her. So she sought her tent.</p>
<p>Presently Ben poked his head between the curtains at the back
of the wagon and said: "There's a hotel here, but I reckon we'll
dodge it. It's called the Gold Mine. Raidy said it was a terrible
dive once, an' it's pretty raw yet. But there's a woman has a
nice place near the edge of town. We can drive in her yard and
get our supper there. It'll be a little change and save waiting.
The men will go on to a farm outside town and make camp."</p>
<p>Hettie peeped out to take a look at the Gold Mine. It was a
drab low building, with vacant eye-like windows, the blinds of
which seemed to hide secrets. Dark faces peered from a wide
doorway.</p>
<p>"Ben, I'd rather not stay in this town," said Hettie.</p>
<p>"Reckon I'm not keen on that myself," replied Ben, with a
laugh. "After supper we'll drive on to where the boys make
camp."</p>
<p>Hettie did not look out again. The driver called, "Getdap" to
his tired horses, and again the wagon rolled on. It relieved
Hettie that some distance was traveled before they made another
halt.</p>
<p>Darkness had fallen when again Ben called: "Come, mother and
Hettie. Supper is ready. And I'll bet it'll be good, for I was in
the kitchen. The woman's name is Mrs. Wood. She's a Westerner,
all right, and likes to talk."</p>
<p>Ina was beside Ben, and he held the sleepy Blaine in his arms.
The house apparently stood back in a large lot, surrounded by
trees through which the wind roared. Ben led the way round to the
side, where a bright light shone. They were ushered into a clean,
warm kitchen, where in the light Hettie saw a stout, ruddy-faced
woman who appeared most agreeable and kind. She had keen eyes
that did not miss anything. Hettie liked her, particularly her
solicitude for the weary little Blaine, who did not thoroughly
awake until he was being fed. Hettie sat at the table, aware of
the ample and appetizing supper, and hungry enough to do justice
to it. But for some reason she could not eat much. She attributed
her inhibition to a nervousness roused on the entrance into this
border town. Yet she was seldom nervous.</p>
<p>Ben and Ida enjoyed the meal, and were not in the least
affected by any unaccountable something in Lineville. Ben
particularly found the woman interesting. He kept asking
questions. Hettie noted that, though Mrs. Wood appeared talkative
in the extreme, she never made one query or showed any curiosity
whatever.</p>
<p>"How long have you lived here?" asked Ben.</p>
<p>"Nigh on to six years now," she replied.</p>
<p>"Then you must have seen Lineville in its heyday?"</p>
<p>"I seen it when it was bad, if that's what you mean. Course
Lineville ain't no Sunday school to-day, but, shucks! it's
nothin' to what I've seen it. Lineville is a growin' town. We've
got a school, post office, church, new stores, an' people comin',
mostly people connected with minin' interests."</p>
<p>"Any cattle?" asked Ben.</p>
<p>"No. The cattle went with the rustlers," she replied,
smiling.</p>
<p>"That's lucky for your town and for the ranchers over the
range," laughed Ben.</p>
<p>"Yes, I guess so. But some rustlers weren't so bad, when you
come to know them. All cattlemen on the open range are rustlers,
if you know what I mean. I've met a pile of Westerners in my day,
an' I've knowed worse men than rustlers. The gamblers, now, I've
no use for them, though my husband was a gambler once, an' a
gunman, too--years back in Texas an' New Mexico, where life was
uncertain, I'll tell you."</p>
<p>"Raidy, one of my men, tells me life used to be pretty
uncertain right here in Lineville, not so long ago," said
Ben.</p>
<p>"Well, that depends upon experience," replied the woman. "Your
man never seen any real frontier towns, such as old Dodge, an'
Cimmaron, or Lincoln, or a hundred others. Not that there wasn't
some real killers droppin' in Lineville now and then, years back.
McPherson, a gambler an' a gunman, which was unusual for
gamblers. An' Sandy Hall. He killed four men here once in a
shootin' row. An' a miner named Hendricks. He was no slouch with
a gun, either. Reckon, though, Jim Lacy was the most dangerous
man who ever struck Lineville."</p>
<p>"Jim Lacy?" said Ben, with interest. "I've heard of him, at
least. What was he like? Did you ever see him?"</p>
<p>"See Jim Lacy! Why, he lived with me two winters," replied
Mrs. Wood. "He used to set right there behind my stove an' talk
for hours. Jim was only a boy. Somethin' like Billy the Kid, who
I knew well. But Jim wasn't mean. He was just the quietest, nice,
soft-speakin' fellar. Circumstances must have made Jim a gunman.
He hailed from Idaho an' he was hell when he got riled. Jim
killed several men here years back. The last one was a
loud-yappin' coyote named Cawthorne. Link Cawthorne. He was the
cheap notoriety-seekin', braggin' gunfighter. An' he was always
tryin' to force Jim Lacy into a fight. Everybody knew Link'd get
killed. But the fool himself couldn't see it. He beat a girl to
death. Then Jim called him out an' shot him. After that Jim left
for Arizona. I've never heard of him since."</p>
<p>"Arizona? That's where we are bound for," replied Ben,
smiling. "We hoped to find the climate there beneficial. But if
Arizona is full of Jim Lacys it might not be so healthy."</p>
<p>"Arizona or any other Territory would only be the better for
men like Jim Lacy," returned the woman, rather brusquely.</p>
<p>"Reckon so. I was only joking," said Ben, as he arose. "We
must be going. Thanks for a capital supper."</p>
<p>She received the money Ben proffered and led the way to the
door, holding the lamp.</p>
<p>"Good luck to you, sir," she said. "It's a glorious country
you're goin' to. But you'll lose this big-eyed sister of yours
over there. . . . Good-by, little boy; you'll grow up on a horse
in Arizona. Good-by, lady, an' you, miss."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c08" id="c08">EIGHT</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>The days multiplied until Hettie no longer could keep account
of them. Endless leagues of Nevada, wastes of barren ground,
plains of green, valleys between bleak ranges, ridge and upland
ever heaving higher, lay back along the winding, rolling
road.</p>
<p>"Boss, we're gettin' into the wild-hoss country," said old
Raidy, one morning, when the caravan was about ready to start.
"Yestiddy we seen herds of broomtails. An' the boys had their
troubles. California Red had to be roped. An' I reckon, to-day,
if you don't put him under a saddle we'll have to hawg-tie
him."</p>
<p>"Fetch Red in," replied Ben, with a gleam of light flashing
across his darkly tanned face. "I'll ride him and help drive the
horses."</p>
<p>The road led over high country, where from every elevation the
defiance of far-flung distances seemed to greet the travelers. A
vast monotony like an invisible blanket covered the land. Gone
were the towns, the mining camps, the lonely ranches of western
and central Nevada. Away to the east and south stretched the
desert solitude, day by day changing by almost imperceptible
degree, gathering color and force, calling and beckoning toward
some unseen yet promised infinitude.</p>
<p>Hettie Ide had come to touch happiness again, strangely,
fearfully, as if these June days were dreams. The action and
incident and life of such travel, day after day, with every mile
bringing new scenes, with the future there beyond the purple
ranges, satisfied a longing she had scarcely known she possessed.
The dust and wind, the chill storms that blew down from the rocky
heights, the rough descents and the slow uphill climbs, the
rolling, rolling of the wagon wheels, the late camps and black
nights, the work that it was imperative she share--all these did
not pall upon Hettie. Rather they discovered some bond between
her and the vague past and grew toward fulfillment of a need of
her soul.</p>
<p>And in watching for and sighting the bands of wild horses she
came at last to understand her brother Ben. His passion for wild
horses that had almost been his ruin! But such conviction, so
long her father's, and therefore accepted by family and friends,
had begun to lose its hold on Hettie. Might not such love of
horses and the open range, solitude, freedom, the hard fare and
toil, the kinship with nature--might not these develop character
to noble ends?</p>
<p>She saw the clouds of dust way out on the desert, under which
dark moving bands of horses, with long manes and tails streaming
in the wind, swept onward, to be swallowed by the gray obscurity.
Black and sharp stood a stallion on a ridge top, silhouetted
against the sky, to leap away and down, wildly instinct with
freedom. On the cedar slopes, where the gnarled and stunted trees
grew wide apart and the bleached dead grass waved over the
outcropping green, wild horses grazed to start erect, lean heads
high, ears and tails up, to stand like statues an instant, bays
and buckskins, blacks and whites, with a pinto flashing like a
zebra here and there, suddenly to bound into action and speed
away.</p>
<p>"I know now why the boys call them broomies," Hettie told her
mother. "Most of them have tails like brooms. Wild, ragged,
scrawny horses! Yet some are sleek and graceful, long of tail and
mane. And now and then I can pick out a beauty."</p>
<p>"I don't want to see any wild horses," replied Mrs. Ide. "I
hope there'll be none where we settle down to ranch."</p>
<p>At times, on level plains or down long slopes, Hettie could
see how Ben and the riders had almost to fight off wild
stallions. How California Red glistened in the sunlight! He was
in his element with the scent of his kind in his nostrils.
Sometimes a piercing whistle floated back to Hettie.</p>
<p>The day passed as if it had flown, and Hettie recorded in
memory pictures of lone stallions, and stragglers and strings and
herds of wild horses numbering into the thousands. That night,
far into the late hours, Hettie heard Ben's riders yelling and
shooting, galloping in and out of camp. It was a hard night for
them.</p>
<p>More wild-horse days, as Ben called them, passed and were
added to the weeks. Then the colored rock walls of Utah rose
above the long slopes of sage and greasewood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Marysville at last! The Mormon town, far over the border into
Utah, had been a Mecca for the riders. Here on the outskirts
horses were rested, wagons were repaired, supplies were bought,
and much-needed information secured.</p>
<p>"Yes, you can cross over into Arizona," an old Mormon told Ben
in Hettie's hearing, while his keen eyes, like blue lightning,
flashed over her. "Good road to Lund an' Kanab. Then you cross
into the land of cliffs an' canyons. An' from there it's slow
travel. Vermilion Cliffs, Buckskin, Rock House Valley, under the
Paria Plateau, an' so on, down the Lee's Ferry an' the Canyon.
When you reach there, stranger, you'll want to turn back. Better
abide here with us, in this desert we've made blossom."</p>
<p>Hettie liked the black-hooded Mormon women, though she pitied
them, and the unseen sealed wives the riders whispered about. The
healthy happy children were most lovable. But when she saw the
old white-bearded Mormons or the tall, still-faced, fire-eyed
sons, she wanted to run back to the covert of her tent.</p>
<p>Then on again, rolling downgrade over a hard desert road,
eating up the miles, the Ide caravan traveled, descending
league-long slopes of red earth and green growths, with the red
cliff walls keeping pace with them, and ever rising higher, as
they wandered on down into the dim-hazed marvelous region of
canyons.</p>
<p>Kanab was a lonesome Mormon settlement close to the Arizona
line. Its white church stood out against the green background;
orchards and fields encompassed log cabins and stone houses;
irrigation ditches bordered the road on both sides. The sun
smiled upon the fertile spot.</p>
<p>Arizona at last! Early the next morning Hettie heard that
pealing slogan from Ben's lusty throat. What magic in a name! But
as she gazed down the green-and-red hollow, thirty miles that
looked like only three, up the purpling slope to the black fringe
of Buckskin Plateau, where it flowed like a river of trees that
merged into a lake of forests, and on to the grandly-looming
Vermilion Cliffs, she marveled no more at the enchantment of that
name. One long breathless look won Hettie Ide forever. After all
the weeks of travel, the training of eye, the judgment of color
and distance, she was confounded here on the border of
Arizona.</p>
<p>"Oh, Ben," she called, "let us stop here!"</p>
<p>But Ben rode far ahead, ever thoughtful of his beloved horses.
Hettie could see him gaze away down the wonderful valley toward
the dim obscurity of the rock-walled fastnesses and again up at
the vast frowning front of Buckskin.</p>
<p>At sunset the riders halted to camp in the edge of the pines,
far above the valley which it had taken all day to cross. It had
to be a dry camp, but the horses had been watered below. Hettie
stood under the last pines and faced the west. She could not tell
what it was that she saw. A glory of gold and purple cloud
overhung a region of red rock, distant, broken, carved, where a
lilac haze in transparent veils and rays spread from the sinking
sun. She looked through that haze into an obscurity baffling and
compelling, where shadows might be mountains and the purple
depths beyond conception.</p>
<p>Then, as the pageant failed and faded, leaving her with a pang
of regret, as if she had suffered actual loss, she turned to the
forest and the camp. What magnificent pines! Black squirrels with
white tails scurried over the brown-matted, bluebell-dotted
ground. Marvie was to be seen prowling from tree to tree with his
rifle. After so many camps on the desert, wide and open and
windy, where camp fires were meager, and there was neither
friendliness nor intimacy, how wonderful this temporary stand in
the forest! Hettie had difficulty drawing her breath and the tang
of pine seemed to clog her nostrils. Ben whistled as he brushed
and combed his horse; the riders sang as they came in with
bridles and nosebags on their arms; little Blaine, now like an
Indian, gamboled about, and Mrs. Ide, as always, was bustling
around the camp fire. Ina seemed busy at the back of her wagon.
Hettie imagined they were nomads, gypsies on the march.</p>
<p>"Supper," sang out Mrs. Ide, cheerily.</p>
<p>"Come an' git it!" yelled Hank as if to outcall her.</p>
<p>"Marvie!" called Ben. His deep voice peeled down through the
darkening aisles of the forest.</p>
<p>That night Hettie sought her bed early, exhausted in mind and
body. But she did not at once fall asleep. Packs of coyotes
surrounded the camp and kept up a continual howling, yelping,
barking, whining. But what a wild, satisfying medley! Back on
Tule Lake it had been an event for Hettie to hear one lonesome
coyote, far off on the hills. On Buckskin Plateau it appeared the
coyotes were many and bold. She was sure several ventured close
to her wagon. At length they gradually worked away, until their
wails and mourns died in the deep forest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hettie imagined she had prepared herself for Arizona. But next
day, when riding horseback for a change, she emerged from the
pines to the edge of the plateau, she was unable even to give an
echo of Ben's stentorian long-drawn "WHOOPEE!"</p>
<p>Wild, beautiful, majestic, zigzagged the Vermilion Cliffs,
towering over another and the vastly greater valley, softly,
deeply purple, and sweeping away, widening like a colossal fan,
out to the desert, where a ragged rent in the earth, tremendous
and awe-inspiring, told Hettie she was gazing at the Grand
Canyon.</p>
<p>From that moment time seemed to cease for Hettie Ide. She let
her horse follow the leaders, and rode down and down, where
neither dust nor heat meant aught to her. The purple valley
yawned and seemed to swallow her. Lost was the sweep of the range
and that fascinating rent in the desert. The red wall towered on
the left, and on the right mounted the gray-sloped black-fringed
plateau.</p>
<p>Over the purple sage-flat strung out the cavalcade, hour after
hour, until another sunset halted the weary travelers in a
grass-green basin, where water salt to the taste wound its
gleaming musical way.</p>
<p>"Two more days, folks, and then the Rubicon!" called out Ben,
prayerfully, yet gayly.</p>
<p>"Wal, boss, what may thet there Rubicon be?" asked Raidy as he
wiped his grimy face.</p>
<p>"Lee's Ferry, man, where we cross the Colorado--if we ever
do."</p>
<p>"Son, we ain't crossin' any Rubies or ferries till we come to
them," relied Raidy. "I'm thinkin' luck is with this Ide
outfit."</p>
<p>"Not a horse lost yet, not a wheel slipped," returned Ben,
throwing up his head, like a lion tossing its mane.</p>
<p>"Wal, we ain't met any hoss thieves yet, or real bad roads.
But the Mormons say wait till we hit across the canyon."</p>
<p>On the morrow, up out of the valley they climbed, like snails;
up out of the green to the dragging sand, and toiled on ever
nearer and nearer the grand jutting corner of the red cliff that
hid the desert beyond.</p>
<p>But at last they rode round under this colossal wall, and
Hettie Ide gasped. Desolation and ruin of earth seemed flung in
her face. Splintered and tumbled wall of red wound down to a
notch where the sinister red river broke through; and on the
other side, another wall as red and ghastly, and lifting its rent
and riven front high to serrated crags, formed the far side of
that great Y-shaped pocket of the desert. No eye-soothing greens
softened the glaring red and yellow. It was a pit of hell, from
which the river gleamed through the split at the apex of the
notch.</p>
<p>The sun beat down terribly hot. The red dust rose in clouds.
Ever lifted the vast overhanging bulge of the plateau, from the
ruins of which countless avalanches had crushed down, to litter
the whole slope between wall and river with myriads of rocks,
huge, sand- and wind-worn into grotesque shapes, adding to the
ghastliness of this inferno.</p>
<p>Here the wagons crept along on slow-creaking wheels; here the
horses lagged and the riders sagged in their saddles; here Hettie
closed her eyes to shut out the glare, the dreadful decay and
devastation, and the millions of glistening surfaces of rock, red
and redder as the red sun sank to rest.</p>
<p>But before the afternoon light failed the travelers rounded
the last corner of the wall, and Hettie opened her eyes upon a
scene that seemed one of enchantment.</p>
<p>A rich dark green oasis lay deep down under lofty precipitous
walls. On three sides these walls enclosed the oval acres of
green, and on the other the sullen river swept by, as sinister as
its surrounding confines, and slid swiftly on into the dark
box-like canyon head, whence floated a bellowing roar of
waters.</p>
<p>"Lee's Ferry," announced Raidy to the speechless onlookers.
"An' the river's low. I was afeared of meltin' snow up in the
mountains. There's the old scow we cross in. Wal, wal! if luck
ain't settin' right in the saddle of this Ide outfit!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c09" id="c09">NINE</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>It was late July and the long wagon-train journey had ended.
The Ides were comfortably camped on a running brook in a grove of
cottonwoods outside the little Arizona hamlet of Sunshine. Ben
had secured a grazing permit for his horses on a ranch near by;
and while his family rested, he scoured the ranges round about in
search of a new home.</p>
<p>Hettie had never seen a man so full of zest and thrill over
any project as Ben was in his search for a ranch in this amazing
and glorious Arizona. His happy eagerness seemed reflected in
all. But on the other hand, it turned out he had difficulty in
finding a place which suited him.</p>
<p>"I want a thousand acres or more--five thousand if I can get
them," he said. "Good water most important. Next I want grass and
timber. Next a fine site for a ranch house, with a splendid
view."</p>
<p>"Say, boss, you sure don't want very much a-tall," declared
old Raidy, a little sarcastic. "Why, they hain't got all thet in
this darned country."</p>
<p>Hettie shared Ben's enthusiasm, and encouraged him in his
ambition. They had journeyed days up from the Colorado River to
this high plateau, where westward the gray-green range seemed
like a vast ocean, waving away into purple distance. To the north
and east it rose to dark red-banded mountains. Hettie loved the
physical attributes of this bewildering Arizona, and so did Ina.
But both of them were anxiously concerned about the wildness of
the place, the aloofness of the few settlers, herders, riders
whom they met, the fact that those mystic, forbidding mountains,
seeming so close, were no other than the Mogollons, which Ben had
been cautioned to avoid. Moreover, they were not so sure that he
would make the wisest of business deals. Yet the buoyancy of his
spirit, the change in him, and the undoubted improvement in Mrs.
Ide's health, who had not been so active and happy for years,
influenced Hettie and Ina not to discourage Ben and to resolve to
stand by him, come what might. Added to this was the actual
romance and appeal of this wilderness.</p>
<p>In the middle of the day it was very hot. The sun blazed down,
burning face and hands. Yet it seemed to cast a dry heat that was
bearable, even at its worst. Then, no matter how hot the sun, the
shade was always cool. That seemed a strange property of this
Arizona atmosphere. Anywhere in the shade it was cool. The
sunshine was golden, the sky azure blue, the desert changeful at
every hour, yet always dreamy, mystic, dim, and wonderful. At
night the dark velvet dome of heaven burned with great white
stars.</p>
<p>The little town, Sunshine, was on the railroad line and trains
passed the Ide camp every day, to little Blaine's infinite
delight. Hettie, too, found them a novelty and she never failed
to watch them. Forty miles from Sunshine, down on a level bare
reach of the desert, lay the town Winthrop. The Ides had stopped
there a day. It was a stock-dealing and freighting town, with a
main street on which saloons were remarkably numerous and
prominent. Ben had preferred not to leave his family there, nor
did he wish to advertise the fact that a rich Californian was
looking for a ranch. They had stayed long enough in Winthrop,
however, to ascertain that there were a number of good stores,
two banks, a huge sawmill, workmen available, and a sprinkling of
solid prosperous Westerners.</p>
<p>After an absence of three days Ben returned on the train late
one afternoon, to descend upon his camp like a whirlwind.</p>
<p>Hettie, who first heard him, called out to Ina: "It's Ben. And
you can bet we're settled now."</p>
<p>"Listen to him," replied Ina, in wondering gladness.
"Well!"</p>
<p>They ran out to find him surrounded by his men, from whom, as
Ina eagerly called, he broke away.</p>
<p>Whereupon she and Hettie and his mother were treated to
bearish hugs, accompanied by various exclamations.</p>
<p>"Oh, gee! Oh, gee!" he continued, dragging them all to the
camp table and benches under a cottonwood. "Give me a drink of
water. I'm thirsty. And I've got to wash my hands and face.
Hungrier than a wolf, too."</p>
<p>They waited on him, after the manner of loving women, plying
him all the while with questions. Presently he flopped down on
the grass and leaned back against the tree.</p>
<p>"I've bought my ranch," he said, with solemn finality, eying
them.</p>
<p>Hettie and Ina regarded him in a momentous silence, but his
mother spoke dryly: "Humph! we know that. I said you'd buy
without even lettin' us women see the place."</p>
<p>"You'll all be crazy about it," he returned.</p>
<p>"Where?" asked Ina, slowly sinking on her knees in front of
him.</p>
<p>"Sixty miles from Winthrop and about a hundred from here."</p>
<p>"How much land?"</p>
<p>"A thousand acres. Fine grazing all around. No other ranches
near. Ten thousand head of cattle. Forty thousand dollars! Isn't
that a bargain?"</p>
<p>"It remains to be seen. You've settled the deal, then?"</p>
<p>"I should smile," he replied, suiting the action to the
words.</p>
<p>"Weren't you rather quick?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Had to be."</p>
<p>"Did you see all those ten thousand cattle? Count them?"</p>
<p>"Gracious, no! Ina, do you think I'm chain lightning? I took
their word for it. The lawyer I engaged in Winthrop found the
title of property okay. So I bought."</p>
<p>"Ben, I hope your ranch isn't out there--toward those
Mogollons," said Hettie, breaking silence and pointing across the
purple-hazed desert to the strange dark uplands.</p>
<p>"By George! Hettie, it <i>is,"</i> he declared, smacking a
hand on his knee. "It's right under the brakes of the Mogollons.
But such a beautiful wild country. I couldn't resist it."</p>
<p>"Didn't you remember what your friend the sheriff said about
the Mogollons?"</p>
<p>"I did, honest I did, Hettie," replied Ben, hastily. "But
listen. I'll tell you all about it. . . . Day before yesterday I
rode back to Winthrop after a hard and disappointing trip to half
a dozen ranches. I was pretty discouraged and was coming back
here pronto. Some horsemen rode up to the hotel where I was
sitting out in front. They got off and tied up to the
hitching-rail. I've gotten used to seeing these Arizonians.
They're sure a rangy, hard-looking lot. But this outfit struck me
as one to look at twice. Several of them packed two guns. They
had fine horses and saddles. When they went in to drink I asked a
cattleman sitting near me who and what they were. 'Wal,' he said,
'it ain't done in these parts--talkin' aboot your neighbors. Sort
of onhealthy.' . . . Presently some one touched me on the
shoulder. I turned round to see one of the riders, a tall fellow,
blond and good-looking, not so young, but not old, either. He had
eyes that looked right through you, but his manner was easy,
friendly. 'Excuse me, sir,' he said. 'Are you the Californian
who's lookin' for a ranch hereabouts?'"</p>
<p>"'Yes, sir. My name's Ide,' I replied, 'and I'm not having
much luck.'"</p>
<p>"'They tell me you're hard to please. But I'm makin' bold to
ask you personally just what kind of a ranch you want to
buy?'"</p>
<p>"So I up and told him, elaborately, just what I was looking
for. Then he laughed, sort of amused and, pulling at his long
mustache, he said: 'My name's Burridge. I've got exactly what you
want. Somewheres around ten thousand head. Lots of unbranded
calves an' yearlin's. Cabins an' corrals not worth speakin' of.
But water, grass, timber, an' range can't be beat in Arizona. It
suits me to sell for cash. That's what they call me--Cash
Burridge. Suppose you get a lawyer an' come over to the city hall
an' see my title. Then if it strikes you right, I'll take you out
to my ranch.'</p>
<p>"Well," went on Ben, reflectively, "Mr. Cash Burridge hit me
about right. I liked his blunt way of putting the deal, and knew
he didn't care a rap whether he sold or not. I consulted a lawyer
recommended by the hotel man, and we met Burridge at the town
hall. The title was clear. So I told Burridge I'd like a look at
his property. We started right out in a buckboard behind a team
of fast horses, I'll tell you. For thirty miles or more the road
was good. Then we pitched off into what he called the brakes.
Briefly, that part of the road was a terror. It was only a trail,
up and down, narrow and rough. Burridge said there was a better
way in, but longer. We reached his ranch before sunset. I'm only
going to tell you that it was the most beautiful and wildest
place I ever saw in my life. But the cabins were filthy,
tumbledown huts. I slept out under the pines. This morning I was
up before sunrise, and if I ever fell in love with anything, it
is that place. It was on a high slope, with level benches
reaching out, all covered with pines. I saw deer, wolves, bear,
turkeys, antelope right from where I stood. Marvie will go crazy
over the place. Also, everywhere I looked there were cattle. You
can look out from the high pine benches down over the most
beautiful valley of grass and sage and cedar, and then down into
the red-and-gold desert, over a hundred miles away. Right there I
asked Burridge how much he wanted. He said fifty thousand. On a
venture I offered forty. He thought it over and took me up. We
returned to Winthrop and closed the deal, at noon to-day. I had
some hours to kill before train-time, so I strolled around into
the stores and saloons. The last I saw of Cash Burridge was in a
gambling hell, and from his look I gathered he was getting rid of
some of his cash. I introduced myself to storekeepers as a
prospective buyer and so gained their interest. But all of them
were rather close-mouthed. They don't talk here in Arizona. One
man told me Burridge probably had ten thousand head of stock.
Then another man said Burridge didn't have so many, but it was
hard to tell. The truth is I didn't get much satisfaction. I
called to see a Mr. Franklidge, the largest cattle-owner in these
parts, and also president of the bank. But he wasn't in. Now to
wind up, I figured Burridge would be shy a lot of cattle on that
number he gave--perhaps a thousand head or more. That is a wide
margin for any kind of a cattle deal, and I'm more than
satisfied. I'll make that the finest ranch in Arizona. We'll go
out there at once and camp, and start the work of home building.
If I don't miss my guess, you'll all fall in love with it as
quickly as I did."</p>
<p>"I have already, Ben," was Ina's reply. "What you love I love.
Your home is my home."</p>
<p>"Ben, am I in on this ranch deal with you?" asked Hettie,
gravely.</p>
<p>"That's for you to say, my dear sister," replied Ben. "But I
believe I'd rather you didn't come in, for it is a risk."</p>
<p>"Then if Ina has no objection, I'll take the risk."</p>
<p>"So will I. We'll share the risk, and together make a grand
success of it," added Ina, happily.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ben hired a guide from Winthrop to lead his horses and riders
across country to the ranch. On the next day the wagons made
Winthrop, where Ben expected to meet Burridge, as agreed. But
Burridge failed to appear. Ben said this was strange, as Burridge
was due to take his outfit over the better road and to make a
count of the cattle, but it was not so strange, nor half so
illuminating, as the glances Ben encountered when he mentioned
Burridge casually to bystanders in Winthrop.</p>
<p>Whereupon Ben procured another guide, a Mexican sheepherder,
who guaranteed to pilot the heavily-laden wagons safely to their
destination.</p>
<p>The four horse teams made good time over the open desert road,
reaching the brakes some thirty miles out by sundown.</p>
<p>Hettie was enthralled by the sunset over the yellow sloping
land and the weird mountains to the west. A storm had been
gathering all day in that direction. The atmosphere had been
sultry. Toward late afternoon the clouds coalesced and hung over
the black ranges, so that when the sun set, the reds and golds
and purples, heightened by the exquisite light, were lovely
beyond compare. At dusk sheet lightning flared low down across
the sky, and faint rumblings of thunder rolled along the
battlements of the desert.</p>
<p>Next morning the travelers rode into rough forest land, where
the main grade was uphill, but the apology for a road plunged
down so often into dry hot ravines that the general ascent had to
be taken for granted.</p>
<p>The forest consisted of cedars, oaks, piñons, and scattered
pines, all of which grew more abundant and larger, sturdier as
the caravan progressed. Travel was exasperatingly slow. In some
places the road was not safe, and the women had to get out and
walk. Ridges like those of a washboard sloped irregularly down
from the south; outcroppings of limestone showed on the gully
banks, pools of water gleamed in the shady washes. Open sandy
flats, where the horses labored, had to be crossed. At length the
cedars and piñons gave place to a heavier growth of pines. Here
the real forest began, and except for the difficulty of travel,
it was vastly satisfying to Hettie. She had her first view of
wild deer and wild turkeys. Marvie reacted to sight of this game
as might have been expected. For that matter, Ben leaped off his
wagon, gun in hand. The progress of the train had to be halted
while the hunters stalked the game. Soon shots reverberated
throughout the forest. Ben returned empty-handed, but Marvie,
with face glowing, exhibited a fine gobbler.</p>
<p>Only fifteen miles were covered that day, and everybody was
wearied and glad to make camp. Before sleep came to Hettie she
heard a blood-curdling cry of a wild beast unknown to her. It
seemed a deep far-away moan, so sad and uncanny that she
shuddered. Next morning Ben told her the cry had come from a
timber wolf, a beast the guide called a lofer and said was
plentiful in those parts.</p>
<p>Tedious travel began into an ever-increasingly wild and
wonderful woodland. The trees hid any possible view of the
country beyond. The air grew clearer, less oppressive, and the
heat no longer made the shade desirable. Massed foliage, like
green lace, dark-brown seamed boles of pines, patches of sunlight
on the white grass, the red of a tufted flower, like a stiff
brush dipped in paint, and golden aisles of needles up and down
the forest, held for Hettie a never-failing delight.</p>
<p>About the middle of the afternoon the travelers rode to the
edge of open light forest.</p>
<p>"We're here," shouted Ben, leaping down. "California to
Arizona! . . . Ina--mother--Blaine--Hettie, get down and come in,
as these Arizonians say."</p>
<p>"Gee! I see turkeys!" cried Marvie, leaping off his horse and
tearing his rifle from the saddle sheath.</p>
<p>"Indian!" called Ben, after him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hettie sat under a great spreading pine on the edge of one of
the level benches that sloped down into the open sage and cedar
country.</p>
<p>She had tramped around until exhausted. A bubbling spring that
gushed from under a mossy rock in a glen had held her only long
enough to yield her a drink. She had passed by the long-unused
and dilapidated corrals, and the ruined old log cabin which Ben
had laughingly told the stricken Ina was to be their abode. The
brook that came singing down from the dark forest slope above
caused Hettie to linger and listen to its music. Across the brook
on another bench stood another old log cabin, or in fact two
small one-roomed cabins, with porch between, and all sheltered
under one long sloping wide-eaved roof of rough moss-stained
shingles. The picturesqueness of this woodland structure appealed
to Hettie. Warily she peeped in, with vivid sense of the vacant
speaking rooms and tumbled-down stone fireplaces, and the lofts
that reached out over half the rooms. What had happened there?
How dark, musty, woody!</p>
<p>"I'll make this my abode and mother's," she decided, with a
thrill at the prospect of home-building. "Repairs, windows,
floors, sheathing! Oh! I can see it! I'll not have a new
house."</p>
<p>And so at last she had found herself on the edge of the wide
bench, back against the last pine, with fascinated gaze riveted
upon the view that Ben had raved about.</p>
<p>"No wonder!" whispered Hettie. "If there were nothing else,
<i>that</i> would be enough."</p>
<p>Her position was on the edge of the irregular timber line,
which stretched on each side of her, with fringes of the forest
here running down to end in straggling lonesome pines, and there
skirting the edge of the steep benches, as if the greatest of
landscape gardeners had planted them there. And so he had, Hettie
averred! What majestic pines! How the summer wind roared above
and back of her, now low, now high, deepening upward with the
denser growth of forest!</p>
<p>But it was the desert that enchanted Hettie. For she doubted
not that the edge of the bench where she sat was the edge of the
desert. Yet how soft, how marvelously purple and gray, how
grandly the slope fell for league on league, widening, rolling,
lengthening, descending, down to the blazing abyss of sand and
rock and canyon.</p>
<p>Sage and grass in the foreground gave that vast valley its
softest beauty, its infinite charms, its mistiness and
brilliance, as if drenched with dew. How like troops of great
beasts appeared the isolated green cedars and the lonely jutting
rocks, some gray, others red. This valley was a portal down to
the dim unknown. On each side it swelled to ranges of foothills,
themselves like trains of colossal camels trooping down to drink.
They were rounded, soft as clouds, gray and pink and faintly
green, without a tree, a rock to mar their exquisite curve. From
the dignity of low mountains these hills dwindled in size until
they were mere mounds that at last flattened out into the
desert.</p>
<p>Every time Hettie moved her absorbed gaze from one far point
to another of the valley, the outlines, the colors, the
distances, the lines of lonely cedars, the winding black threads
of gullies--all seemed to change, to magnify in her sight, to
draw upon her emotion, and to command her to set her eyes upon
that sublime distance, that ethereal blending of hues and forms,
that stunning mystery of the desert, of that magnificent arid
zone which gave this country its name.</p>
<p>"I can only look--and learn to worship," whispered Hettie, in
a rapture. "It awakens me. What little have I seen and known! . .
. Oh, lonely wild land--oh, Arizona! if you shelter <i>him</i> my
prayer is answered, my cup is full!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Ides, imbued with Ben's spirit, set earnestly to work to
wrest a beautiful home from this wilderness.</p>
<p>Two gangs of Mexican laborers, lent by the railroad, in the
charge of capable men, were put to work clearing and grading a
road, felling and hauling timber. Teamsters from Winthrop made a
trip out every other day, bringing lumber, shingles, windows and
doors, bricks and cement, pipe and plumbing, which were housed in
a temporary shelter. Carpenters began to erect Ben's house, which
was to be a long, one-story structure, with log walls, high
peaked roofs, wide porches. Barns and corrals were planned, a
reservoir from which the cold spring water could be piped into
the houses and corrals, corn cribs and storehouses, and many
other practical things Ben considered necessary.</p>
<p>Those were busy days. The work caused almost as much interest
as a circus might have. There were many visitors, mostly
sheepherders and cowmen from the surrounding range. Occasionally
riders on high-gaited horses rode in, watched the work from a
distance, looked long at Ben's fine horses, and especially
California Red, and rode away without any pretense of
friendliness. Old Raidy shook his head dubiously at sight of
these men. Apparently they caused no concern to Ben. Hettie
imagined that she alone divined what was going on in her
brother's mind. She dared not voice it, but in her own secret
thoughts she hugged it to her heart. She believed that Ben had
deliberately chosen this wild spot in a wild range to develop a
famous ranch, which would become a lodestone for cowboys,
ranchers, cattlemen of all types, sheepmen, rustlers, outlaws,
gunmen, through one of whom he might locate his lost friend
Nevada. Hettie was convinced of this. It thrilled her very soul.
What a reckless, yet grand thing for a man to do in search of his
friend!</p>
<p>Hence, Hettie decided, Ben's intense interest in all visitors
did not spring wholly from his desire to be neighborly. Yet,
despite the good words that at once spread abroad his generosity
and kindliness, and the fact that his coming meant much for this
section of Arizona, the ranchers along the three hundred miles of
the Mogollon Plateau were slow to call.</p>
<p>Nor did Cash Burridge come to count the cattle he had sold
Ben. This omission caused Raidy and the riders from California
much concern. They began to make dark hints round the camp fire,
and were not particular about who heard them. Ben looked serious,
but only laughed. Manifestly he was working and waiting, without
worrying.</p>
<p>One hot midday, during the noon rest hour, when Ben and his
family were having lunch in the shade of the pines, a rider
appeared on the road. He came on at a walk and he was looking
everywhere with great interest. Finally he took to the slope, and
at length, arriving at the camp quarters, he dismounted and
hailed the riders in a booming voice.</p>
<p>"I'm Tom Day an' I'm wantin' to meet Mr. Ide."</p>
<p>Raidy led him up to Ben, who rose expectantly, a smile on his
sunburnt face.</p>
<p>"Howdy, sir!" said the visitor, extending a huge hand. "Are
you Mr. Ide?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and I'm glad to meet you, Mr. Day," replied Ben, who
evidently had heard of this man.</p>
<p>"I'm your nearest neighbor," said Day. "My ranch is over heah
ten miles or so. Reckon I'm a little late in callin'. Shore we're
pretty slow folks in Arizona."</p>
<p>"Better late than never," returned Ben, with his frank smile.
"Meet my family, Mr. Day. . . . This is Ina, my wife . . . and
this is my mother. . . . Hettie, my sister. . . . And this is my
son Blaine, who's destined to be an Arizona rancher."</p>
<p>"Wal now, I'm shore glad to meet you-all," drawled the
visitor, with an accent so surely Texan that it made Hettie's
heart leap. He greeted them with a quaint courtliness that became
him well, despite his rough soiled rider's garb. He made much of
little Blaine, whom evidently he won at first sight.</p>
<p>Hettie, too, trusted him at first sight. This huge rancher was
surely a Texan. He had a shock of fair hair, beginning to turn
gray. His broad face was wrinkled like a brown parchment,
recording the endurance, toil, and strife of a wonderful life. He
had shrewd, penetrating, kindly eyes, light blue in color, and
set under bushy brows.</p>
<p>"Reckon I'd like you to show me aboot," said Day to Ben,
waving his hand toward the benches.</p>
<p>"I'll be glad to, and I'd like your opinion on some of my
new-fangled ideas," replied Ben. Then he turned to Hettie. "Sis,
have Hank fix us up something to eat and drink presently."</p>
<p>They strolled away in earnest conversation and did not return
for an hour. Whereupon Hettie set lunch for them on the table
under the fly; after which she repaired to her wagon-tent close
by.</p>
<p>"Ide, the good looks of thet sister of yours has spread over
the range," said Day. "Shore, she's a lovely lass."</p>
<p>"Hettie? Thanks. Yes indeed, and she's more than pretty,"
replied Ben, evidently much pleased.</p>
<p>"Girls are scarce in Arizona. Is she married?"</p>
<p>"No. Why, Hettie's only twenty!"</p>
<p>"Engaged to any lucky fellar?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm sure not."</p>
<p>"Wal, she'll shore have these long-legged punchers comin'
around moon-eyed."</p>
<p>"If they don't they're not like my California riders," laughed
Ben.</p>
<p>"Wal, I'll say if them riders of yours are as good at makin'
love as they are at gossipin', our Arizona lads won't have much
chance."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid my men do talk too much," observed Ben, seriously.
"They brag, and I don't believe bragging will get very far in
Arizona."</p>
<p>"Wal, only so far as makin' brag good," drawled Day. "Ide, I
reckon I've taken a shine to you. It ain't Arizona ways, but
somebody ought to give you some hunches. Reckon I never had such
an idee when I rode over heah. I was downright curious, but
reckon I expected to find you-all different."</p>
<p>"Mr. Day, I take that as a compliment and an offer of
friendship," returned Ben heartily. "I was told in Winthrop to
try to make friends with you. Lord knows I'm going to need a
friend out here."</p>
<p>"Wal, heah's my hand," said Day, "an' I'm shore seein' you're
not such a dam' fool as is bein' gossiped over the range."</p>
<p>"Maybe I <i>am</i> a damn fool, Day," returned Ben, grimly.
"But at least I know what I'm going to do in the long run."</p>
<p>"Shore then you figger you're up ag'in a hell of a deal heah?"
queried Day.</p>
<p>"You bet I know it. I expected it and I'm not going to be
disappointed."</p>
<p>"All right. Thet's good talk to me. Fust off, are you goin' in
for big cattle-raisin'?"</p>
<p>"Yes. And horses, too."</p>
<p>"Ahuh. You shore have some fine stock. Thet red hoss! Say,
he's grand! Reckon you'll have to keep him close or he'll be
stolen. . . . Are you goin' to keep your family heah all the year
round?"</p>
<p>"No. I'll take or send them back to California for the
winter."</p>
<p>"Thet's good," replied Day. "The winters are bad some seasons.
Not so cold, but it snows deep an' pens people up. Winter don't
come, though, till late December. Why, I've seen Christmas heah
the finest kind of weather!"</p>
<p>"That's splendid news. Now, Day, you encourage me to ask
questions. Can you put me on to some crack Arizona cowboys? I'll
keep Raidy and perhaps another of my riders, and send the others
home."</p>
<p>"Shore I was goin' to advise thet. You'll have no trouble
hirin' the best men out heah, because you can pay better wages.
Our riders only get forty dollars, an' often not thet."</p>
<p>"But how am I to know riders who are honest, not to mention
other qualifications?"</p>
<p>"Son, you're shore askin' me a question thet even Franklidge,
the boss rancher of this country, cain't answer. I'm sorry to
have to confess thet. But the honest Gawd's truth is this--nobody
heah knows who's a rustler an' who's not."</p>
<p>"Good Heavens! Day, you don't mean that!" cried Ben,
shocked.</p>
<p>"Wal, I shore do. I know for a fact I'm a square cattleman.
I've branded calves in my day thet wasn't mine an' I knowed they
wasn't. Every rancher has done thet, an' few there are in this
neck of the woods who don't do it now. But I don't. Thet you can
rely on, Ide, I swear. There are ranchers heah who suspect me,
same as I suspect them. For this reason: Rustlin' cattle is a
mighty big business along the three hundred miles of Mogollon
range. The country grazes hundreds of thousands of cattle. They
reckon Franklidge alone has a hundred thousand haid. Wal, it's
great pickin' fer the rustlers. There's the Hash Knife gang, heah
for many years. There's the Pine Tree outfit, which is newer an'
wuss. An' no <i>honest</i> rancher can name the leader of thet
outfit. He's shore some one of us ranchers, shore as hell. Then
there's a host of lesser rustlers clear down to the cowboy who's
startin' a herd of his own. . . . Thet, Ide, is the country
you've come to ranch in."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm a son-of-a-gun!" ejaculated Ben.</p>
<p>"Shore you are. I wish I could have met you before you laid
out so much money heah. How many cattle did Burridge sell
you?"</p>
<p>"Ten thousand head," replied Ben. "I took his word. But at the
same time I figured if he was a thousand head or so shy I'd be
satisfied."</p>
<p>"Wal, you figgered good, but not good enough," said Day,
gruffly. "Never take no man's word for a count of cattle. You
want to see them brands. Burridge, now, had a half a dozen
brands, but he never had no ten thousand, nor eight thousand, nor
. . . Nobody could ever tell how many haid he ran. He was always
sellin' cattle."</p>
<p>"What do you think of Burridge failing to make a count for me?
He promised to do so at once."</p>
<p>"Wal, I don't like to say what I think. But if Burridge shows
up soon an' makes a count, it'll be a good deal more than I have
any idee he'll do."</p>
<p>"He'll not come," said Ben, decidedly. "Day, there's no doubt
in my mind. Burridge has cheated me."</p>
<p>"Wal, don't you say thet to anyone else around heah," warned
Day. "Be careful <i>what</i> you say, Ide. An' make your men keep
their mouths shut. I'll let you have two of my boys, an' I can
get you another. For all I know they're square, an' they're shore
hard-ridin' an' hard-shootin' punchers."</p>
<p>"That's good of you, Day," responded Ben, with gratitude. "I
sure appreciate it. I may be able to do you a favor now and then,
since we're neighbors."</p>
<p>"I'm wonderin' about somethin', yet there ain't any sense in
me doin' it."</p>
<p>"What?" asked Ben.</p>
<p>"Shore, Burridge didn't tell you thet I had a
four-thousand-dollar lien on his cattle?"</p>
<p>"No, he sure didn't," returned Ben, shortly.</p>
<p>"Wal, I have. Soon after he come heah--let's see, about four
years ago, I lent him the money. He paid interest for a while,
then he quit, an' I was after him pretty hard when he sold out to
you."</p>
<p>"That's bad news, Day," said Ben, soberly.</p>
<p>"Wal, I reckon, but don't let it worry you none, so far as I'm
concerned. But there's wuss. The Hatts also have a lien on
Burridge's stock."</p>
<p>"Well, well! this is getting thick. Who are the Hatts?"</p>
<p>"Father an' three sons. There's a girl, too, pretty young
lass, the only decent one of a bad lot."</p>
<p>"Where do these Hatts live?"</p>
<p>"They're backwoodsmen an' live back in the brakes. Fact is all
the rustlers an' outlaws hole up in these brakes, which are rough
canyons runnin' down from the Mogollons. Rough they are, the
hardest goin' in Arizona. It used to be Apache country."</p>
<p>"So Burridge palmed his debts off on me? Damn him! . . .
What's the law in such a case as this?"</p>
<p>"Wal, I've knowed it come up in court more'n once. An' the
buyer had to settle. You see, Burridge's property wasn't really
his to sell."</p>
<p>"I appreciate that. I should have taken time to inquire. But
he struck me right."</p>
<p>"Shore. He did the same to me, an' I'm an old timer."</p>
<p>"What the devil shall I do, Day? I don't mean about the liens.
I'll have to settle them, soon as they are proven. But this deal
shows up more complicated every day. How many cattle do I
actually own? Where are they? How will I go about safe-guarding
what I do own?"</p>
<p>"Son, the Lord himself couldn't answer them questions,"
replied the rancher, with his booming laugh. "But I reckon the
case ain't so bad thet we'll have to take to drink about it. I'll
ride over with these boys I'm gettin' you, say week today.
Meanwhile I'll do a lot of thinkin'. Probably by thet time Elam
Hatt will have seen you. I heerd he was comin', so look out fer
him. We'll get your men an' we'll all put our haids
together."</p>
<p>"Thank you very much, Day," rejoined Ben, most gratefully.
"It's sure lucky for me that you came over."</p>
<p>"Wal, mebbe it's lucky fer me, too," said Day. "One more hunch
before I go, an' I shore must be rustlin' home. There'll be other
ranchers callin' on you, an' some of them will talk deals. Go
slow. Don't offend, but don't go in anythin' without consultin'
me."</p>
<p>"By George! you needn't caution me about that," returned Ben.
"I'm too scared. Why, my wife and sister will have a fit when
they find out how Burridge fooled me!"</p>
<p>"Wal, my advice is don't tell your wimmin-folks. What they
don't know shore won't hurt them."</p>
<p>"But I should tell you my sister Hettie is in on this deal
with me. She wanted a half interest, but I let her have only one
third. Thank goodness!"</p>
<p>"Thet big-eyed lass! She must have a lot of money."</p>
<p>"Hettie is well off, yes. She's clever, too. I wish I had
listened to her."</p>
<p>"Wal, wal! Thet lass--handsome an' rich! Golly! Some
cow-puncher is shore goin' to fall into heaven. I wish I was a
youngster. Reckon as it is I'll have to pick out the best fellar
heahaboots fer her."</p>
<p>"I'm advising <i>you</i> now," laughed Ben. "Don't try that
with Hettie, if you want her to like you."</p>
<p>"Thanks fer the hunch, Ide. . . . Wal, I said before I must be
goin', an' heah I am yet."</p>
<p>"There's one thing--I--nearly forgot," said Ben, with
hesitation and change of tone. "You must know everybody in
Arizona?"</p>
<p>"Lord, no, son! Why, Arizona is most as big as the rest of the
United States! But I'm pretty well acquainted all through
heah."</p>
<p>"Did you ever know or hear of a--a fellow who--who went by the
name of Nevada?" Ben's voice shook a little, and that tremor was
communicated poignantly to Hettie, who sat listening in her
tent.</p>
<p>"Nevada?" queried Day, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"Yes, Nevada. It was a nickname, of course. I never knew
his--this fellow's other name."</p>
<p>"Humph! Somebody who did you a bad turn?"</p>
<p>"No indeed. I--reckon it was the other way."</p>
<p>"Wal, I'm sorry. Nevada? No, I never heerd thet handle on a
fellar in my life. I've a good memory fer names. I've knowed a
heap of Arizonie's in my time, an' Texas Jacks, an' Colorado
somethin's or other. But no Nevada."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c10" id="c10">TEN</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Some eighteen or twenty miles from Tom Day's ranch, Judge
Franklidge maintained the last outpost of his extensive cattle
range south of the railroad toward the Mogollons.</p>
<p>This property, called the Chevelon Ranch, as had many another,
had come into his possession by the failure of a homesteader. At
some time or other Franklidge had lent money or staked cattle to
every poor settler in that part of Arizona. His kindness and
generosity had for many years made him a mark. But though he had
never been known to drive a hard bargain or force a payment, he
had prospered through most all of his transactions. Chevelon
Ranch, however, was a losing proposition so far as actual
cattle-raising was concerned.</p>
<p>The hundred and sixty acres which comprised the ranch lay in a
strip along the rim of Chevelon Canyon, one of the deep wild
gorges that constituted part of the brakes of the Mogollons. Here
the cedar piñon forest was at its thickest, and a little higher
and farther south it merged into the belt of pines. Water was
abundant, but it was down in the canyon and had to be pumped up.
When the pump did not operate the water had to be packed up.</p>
<p>Cabins and corrals, built of logs, showed the weathering of
years of storm and heat. The main cabin stood on the rim, and the
wide porch ran to the edge of the gray rock wall. On this
mid-August afternoon the porch was a shady and cool place to
lounge and rest. The deep canyon was densely green with oak and
cedar; a low roar of running water floated dreamily from the
depths; the drowsy summer air was redolent with a sweet dry
fragrance.</p>
<p>Judge Franklidge had just arrived on one of his rare visits to
this margin of his vast cattle interests. The long hot dusty ride
out from Winthrop had tired him, and with a great sigh of content
he sank into one of the comfortable seats on the porch.</p>
<p>"Jack," he said to the cowboy who had driven him out, "I'm to
meet Day here. Put the horses up. I'll stay all night. Then find
Day if he's arrived, and come back yourself."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. An' how aboot Stewart?" replied the cowboy.</p>
<p>"Stewart? Tell him I'll send word when I want him," returned
the judge, somewhat impatiently.</p>
<p>"All right, sir," said Jack, and slapping the reins he drove
away toward the barn.</p>
<p>"Humph! I'd forgotten about that foreman," muttered Judge
Franklidge. "Damn the cattle business, anyway. . . . I'd like to
forget it and enjoy the peace of this place."</p>
<p>This ranch was a favorite with Franklidge, owing to its wild
beauty and solitude and the abundance of deer and turkey that
ranged the forests. Every fall he came there for a few days of
hunting.</p>
<p>"I'll invite young Ide to hunt with me in October," he
soliloquized. "Fine chap that. Too bad about the rotten deal he
fell into here. It sure doesn't speak well for Arizona. And what
a lovely girl that sister of his! . . . If I were younger now . .
."</p>
<p>The Judge fell into a daydream that amused as well as made him
sigh. Presently a jangle of spurs and thud of footsteps
interrupted his reverie, and he looked up to see Tom Day and the
cowboy approaching. Day had his hand on the younger man's
shoulder and was talking earnestly. That reminded the judge of
the strong friendship Day had always evinced for this young man
the range called Texas Jack. How good to see two men he could
swear by!</p>
<p>"Howdy, Judge! I'm shore glad to see you," said Day, as he
heavily mounted the porch with beaming smile and extended
hand.</p>
<p>"How are you, Tom? Pull up that bench. We're in for a good
long talk."</p>
<p>"Wal, it's aboot time," returned Day, as he deposited his huge
bulk on a seat, with back to the porch rail. He threw his
sombrero to the floor.</p>
<p>The judge laughed, and then glanced sharply at the cowboy
waiting at the step.</p>
<p>"Jack, you've got something on your mind," he said.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, but it can wait. No hurry, sir," replied the
cowboy, hastily.</p>
<p>"Wal, Judge, if you'll take a hunch from me you'll not wait
too long," interposed Day.</p>
<p>"Come up and sit in with us, Jack," was Franklidge's
reply.</p>
<p>The cowboy did as he was bidden, but he made no reply. He sat
near the porch rail and leaned over to gaze down into the green
canyon. The judge's appraising eyes took stock of the lithe
figure, the service-worn garb, the lean bearded face that was
half hidden under the wide sombrero.</p>
<p>"Stewart was in town last night, drunk," spoke Franklidge,
casually. "Is he here to-day?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir--an' he's all right now," rejoined the cowboy.</p>
<p>"Judge, your foreman <i>may</i> be all right, as Texas Jack
says, but I've my doubts," put in Day. "I cain't find anythin'
ag'in' him, 'cept the drinkin'. But I've just come to distrust
the man. Mebbe I'm wrong. It shore is a distrustful time."</p>
<p>"Mr. Franklidge, I hunted up Stewart, an' found him an' Dillon
off under a cedar, talkin' deep an' quiet," said Texas Jack.</p>
<p>"Dillon? Who's he? That name's familiar."</p>
<p>"Dillon is young Ben Ide's foreman," replied Day, with
interest. "He's held jobs all over the range the last two years.
Fine cowman. Engagin' sort of chap. Everybody likes him. I shore
do."</p>
<p>"Which ought to be recommendation enough for Ide or even me,
sore old cattleman that I am. . . . Well, Tom, have you
considered the offer I made you some time ago?"</p>
<p>"Reckon I have, Judge, an' I'm acceptin' with thanks. I know
I'm gettin' the best of the deal," returned Day, heartily.</p>
<p>"We're not agreed on that. You're counting only the relative
value of your ranch compared with this one. But I count your
friendship and help. . . . It's a deal, then."</p>
<p>"Heah's my hand, Judge," said Day, reaching out his huge
paw.</p>
<p>"We're partners, then," replied Franklidge, as he shook the
proffered hand. "We'll throw these ranches and all the stock
together, I'll have papers made out when I get back to town. . .
. Now get what's troubling you off your chest."</p>
<p>"Wal, boss, the situation heah has grown from bad to wuss,"
returned Day, seriously.</p>
<p>"Where do you mean by here?" demanded Franklidge.</p>
<p>"All this range thet haids along the wild brakes of the
Mogollons. Say, fifty miles in a straight line."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Reckon it takes in a good many ranches, countin' everybody,
an' mebbe two hundred thousand haid of cattle. But Ben Ide's
range an' this one of yours an' mine have come in fer the wust of
the rustlin' this last month."</p>
<p>"We've always had rustlers to deal with. We always will have.
What's the difference between say a year or five years ago and
now?"</p>
<p>"Wal, Judge, fer a big cattleman you're shore poor
informed."</p>
<p>"Tom, you know most of my holdings lie along the railroad and
north in the open country. I know next to nothing about what goes
on in this backwoods. That's why I wanted you for a partner."</p>
<p>"The difference you asked aboot I'd calkilate offhand to stand
you an' me an' Ben Ide around ten thousand haid."</p>
<p>The Judge's boots came down off the porch rail with a
crash.</p>
<p>"What?" he demanded, incredulously.</p>
<p>"Boss, I said ten thousand, an' mebbe thet's conservative.
Shore most of this rustled stock belongs to Ide. But we've lost a
good deal, an' stand to lose more or all unless somethin' is
done. You see, Ide proved an easy mark. He bought out Burridge,
who had some stock, nobody knows how much. Wal, young Ide's cow
outfit was green an' raw for Arizona. I gave him two of my best
riders. One of them, Sam Tull, was found daid in the woods. Shot!
We've never found out aboot it. The other cowboy, Rang Jones, had
a quarrel with Dillon an' quit. I cain't see thet Dillon has
changed matters fer the better. But I reckon no one man could at
this stage of the game."</p>
<p>"So they've hit young Ide hard," muttered Franklidge,
indignantly. "Funny he didn't complain to me. I've seen something
of him lately."</p>
<p>"Ide's not thet kind, Judge," replied Day, warmly. "He's as
game as they come. An' his sister--say, she's a thoroughbred. She
stands to lose 'most as much as Ide."</p>
<p>The two men, warming to the subject, might have been alone for
all the notice they took of Texas Jack. He leaned far over the
porch rail, his face hidden, his long lithe form strung like a
whipcord. It was the strained position of a listening deer.</p>
<p>"Tom, I admire Miss Ide very much indeed, and her brother,
too," responded the judge. "I regret exceedingly the reception
Arizona has given these two fine young people. I am ashamed. We
all ought to be ashamed. We must end this damned wholesale
cattle-stealing."</p>
<p>"Ahuh! . . . Boss, I reckon I feel it more than you, as I've
come to be friends with the Ides. Why, he paid Burridge's debt to
me. Four thousand! An' then I'm a son-of-gun if he didn't send
for Elam Hatt an' pay the lien he had on Burridge. Don't know how
much. But the Hatts were drunk fer a week."</p>
<p>"Well!" ejaculated Franklidge.</p>
<p>"Every since then the rustlers have been bolder than I ever
seen them yet in Arizonie."</p>
<p>"Who are these rustlers, Tom?"</p>
<p>"Huh! If I said what I think it'd be old to you. But I reckon
there is a new leader workin' now. Shore they're all workin'. But
there's some big chief who's keen as a wolf."</p>
<p>"Where are these stolen cattle driven?" asked the judge,
wonderingly. "I've been twenty years in this business. Yet this
beats me."</p>
<p>"Reckon the stock gets drove everywhere," replied Day.</p>
<p>"Not to the railroad?" queried Franklidge, aghast.</p>
<p>"Shore to the railroad. Not to Winthrop. But, man, there's
other stations along the line. Then I had a Mexican sheepherder
tell me he'd seen herds of cattle drove over the Rim, down into
the Tonto. Thet's a wild country. Shore no cow outfits are
followin' rustlers down into the Tonto."</p>
<p>"Tom, the Hatts are a bad outfit," rejoined the Judge,
thoughtfully. "Some years ago I had trouble with Elam Hatt. The
Stillwells are another. Surely these backwoodsmen run with these
rustler outfits."</p>
<p>"Shore they do," snorted Day. "But I reckon the Hatts ain't
the ringleaders. Cedar Hatt is the wust of thet bad lot. He's
dangerous. Bad <i>hombre</i> with guns! Ever' once in a while I
heah of some shootin' scrape he's been in out there, among his
own kind. The Mexican herders are afraid of Cedar. But they're
close-mouthed. In the years I've lived heah I've known of several
sheepherders bein' murdered."</p>
<p>"Cedar Hatt?" mused the Judge. "Yes, I know of him. Bad name;
gun-fighter. . . . How many Hatts in the family?"</p>
<p>"I know the whole outfit," replied Day. "Elam an' me always
got along pretty good. But I've no use fer Cedar. He's the eldest
son. Then there's Henny an' Tobe--packrats if I ever seen any in
the woods. An' last there's a girl--Rose. Reckon she'll be aboot
sixteen. Pretty slip of a lass, whose mother died when she was a
baby."</p>
<p>"What a pity! No mother. No decent home. No schooling. There
are many such unfortunate girls in this wild country, alas! Why
don't some cowboys take this Rose away and marry her? She might
turn out a good woman."</p>
<p>"Shore she might. An' so I've said often. But I ain't hit on
any cowboy yet who cared to risk his skin down there in the
brakes."</p>
<p>"What has Ide done in regard to the raids on his stock?" asked
the judge, curiously.</p>
<p>"Aboot all any man could," replied Day, admiringly. "He has
spent a lot of money hiring extra hands to trail stock. He took
over this Dillon at a high salary. An' I reckon he puts a good
deal of confidence in Dillon. Funny about Ben Ide, though. He
gets sore when the rustlers make a raid. But he really don't care
a damn aboot the cattle. He's shore afraid fer his horses,
though, specially thet California Red. There's a grand hoss,
Judge. I'll bet if the rustlers got thet stallion Ben Ide would
hit the trail himself. Strikes me he's seen some wild life. He
shore is a rider. Strange, wonderful sort of chap Ben Ide is. I'm
just gettin' acquainted with him. He always struck me as a
rancher whose heart wasn't in his ranch. There's somethin' he
wants. But he worships his wife an' kid an' thet handsome sister.
It ain't thet. I cain't explain what I don't savvy. But I've a
hunch young Ide has been hurt. Mebbe he killed some one over in
California an' had to get out. I've often wondered if thet could
be it. Then it might be he's <i>lookin'</i> fer some man. Like a
Texan, you know, who never <i>forgot."</i></p>
<p>Before the judge could reply to Day's earnest statement the
cowboy, Texas Jack, whirled round with a silent wrestling
violence that indicated a suppressed and poignant passion. Under
the shadow of his broad sombrero his eyes gleamed like clear
coals of fire.</p>
<p>"I'm--heahin'--all--you say!" he burst out, pantingly.</p>
<p>"Suppose you are, Jack?" queried the judge, in kindly
surprise. "If I'd minded about being overheard I'd have sent you
away."</p>
<p>Tom Day stared, and it was evident he was not so surprised as
expectant. He had lived with cowboys all his life.</p>
<p>"Wal, what the hell ails you, son?" he growled.</p>
<p>Jack whirled away in the same sudden violent action with which
he had faced them, only now it seemed there was added a fierce
struggle of mind over body. He bent over the rail. He sprang up
erect and rigid. In a moment more he turned toward the men again,
to present a remarkably transformed front.</p>
<p>"I'm shore beggin' pardon, Mr. Franklidge, an' of you too,
Tom," he drawled, in slow, cool, easy speech. "I couldn't help
heahin' all you said, an'--wal, it knocked me off my
balance."</p>
<p>"No offense, Jack," replied the judge, kindly. "I think Tom's
talk sort of locoed me, too."</p>
<p>"Wal, see heah, you long, lean, hungry-eyed Texan," spoke up
Day, forcefully, "jest <i>why</i> did I knock you off your
balance?"</p>
<p>"Tom, I reckon I happened to hit on a way to fix the
rustlers," replied Jack, nonchalantly.</p>
<p>"The hell you did!" ejaculated Day. He accepted the statement
without doubt or ridicule. He was pondering deeply. His sharp
light-blue glance was riveted on the shadowy, half-concealed eyes
of the cowboy.</p>
<p>Judge Franklidge sat up with a jerk, but his smile robbed his
action of a convincing sincerity.</p>
<p>"Jack, we'd be grateful for any suggestions from one as well
proven as you on the range."</p>
<p>"Wal, what is this heah idee you hit on?" added Day,
sharply.</p>
<p>"Shore it's as simple as a-b-c," rejoined the cowboy, blandly.
"Somebody has got to ride down into the brakes an' get thick with
the rustlers."</p>
<p>"Oh-ho! I see!" quoth Day, almost derisively.</p>
<p>The cowboy's mild manner changed subtly, in a way to impress
his listeners, though they could not have told how.</p>
<p>"Somebody has got to shoot up the Hatts an' mebbe the
Stillwells. An' kill some of that Pine Tree outfit--in particular
the <i>hombre</i> who's at the haid of it."</p>
<p>"Is <i>thet</i> all? My Gawd! Jack, I shore thought you'd hit
on somethin' hard to pull off," returned Day, with infinite
scorn.</p>
<p>"Shore it'd be hard enough," admitted Texas Jack, who refused
to see the ridicule.</p>
<p>"Hard! Fly, cowboy, you're loco!" exploded the other. "Shore
you hit on the way to fix the rustlers. Shore! But who'n hell's
goin' to do it? Was you figurin' on us hirin' some fancy
gun-slingers to do the little job? Kingfisher from Texas, huh?
An' Wess Hardin? Or mebbe you had in mind some new Billy the Kid
or Pat Garrett? Or more like, perhaps, Jim Lacey, who they say
has been hidin' quiet in Arizonie for a long time!"</p>
<p>Texas Jack's tan appeared to become a shade less brown. He
grew tense, steely-eyed.</p>
<p>"Tom Day, how long have you known me?" he demanded, in a voice
that rang.</p>
<p>"Two years an' more, son," replied Day, surrendering to
something compelling.</p>
<p>"Would you trust me?"</p>
<p>"I shore would. With my stock, my money, my reputation . . .
with my life--so help me Gawd!"</p>
<p>"Judge Franklidge, how long have I worked for you!" queried
the cowboy, turning to the other.</p>
<p>"About a year and a half, as I remember."</p>
<p>"An' what is your opinion of me--as a man?" flashed the
cowboy, growing more piercing of eye and voice.</p>
<p>"Jack, you're the squarest and best man, the finest hand who
ever worked for me!" responded the judge, feelingly.</p>
<p>"Thank you. Reckon you can have no idee what that means to
me," returned the cowboy. "An' you'd trust me?"</p>
<p>"As well as I would my own flesh and blood."</p>
<p>Texas Jack removed his sombrero and sailed it against the
wall. His brow was broad and pale, his clear light eyes seemed to
burn with a steady flame; there were white hairs in the long
locks smoothed back above his ears; under the thin bronze beard,
cheeks and lips set hard.</p>
<p>"Wal, then, it's my job to fix the rustlers," he said,
deliberately.</p>
<p>"You! Nonsense!" declared the judge. "You wouldn't tackle that
alone?"</p>
<p>"It's got to be done alone."</p>
<p>"Nonsense! I say."</p>
<p>"Judge," interposed Tom Day, "it shore does look thet way. But
wait. This cowboy has got somethin' up his sleeve. I always
knowed it. . . . Come heah, Texas Jack. Spring it."</p>
<p>What shrewd, hard, comprehending yet wondering light flashed
from the old rancher's eyes!</p>
<p>"Listen," went on Jack, bending to his hearers. "To serve
Arizona an' you an' your good friends I've got to become a
rustler. I may have to go a long way to find the leader of this
heah Pine Tree outfit. I'll have to drink an' steal an' kill.
Shore I may lose my life finishin' the job. An' I want my secret
kept till it's ended. Then if I come back alive I want my name
cleared."</p>
<p>"Who'n hell <i>are</i> you?" asked Tom Day, in low and husky
voice.</p>
<p>"Man, you're forcing me against my will," said the judge,
rising to his feet. "I don't want you to attempt this thing
alone. It's a wild cowboy idea. You'd only be killed. But I
admire you, Jack."</p>
<p>"Dead or alive, I want my name cleared!" exclaimed the
cowboy.</p>
<p>"Of what?"</p>
<p>"Of the stealin' an' lyin' I'll have to do."</p>
<p>"Man, I have power to make you a deputy sheriff right here and
now. And I'd do it."</p>
<p>"No. Shore I'll never be an officer of the law. What I want is
this. Your word of honor to keep my secret, an', if I come back
alive, to clear my name."</p>
<p>"Jack, are you going to persist in this mad plan?" demanded
the judge.</p>
<p>"Reckon I shore will, whether you stand by me or not,"
returned the other, grimly. "It's too late now. I've got a
reason, Judge. But it'd only be fair for you to uphold me--to
tell in court, if necessary, that you an' Tom Day were parties to
the job I undertook."</p>
<p>"Jack you misunderstand," replied Franklidge, hastily. "Don't
make me ashamed. I will give you any support and authority right
here and now. In writing, if you want."</p>
<p>"Only your word, Judge."</p>
<p>"There! You have it. And here's my hand."</p>
<p>Texas Jack broke from the strong, earnest handclasp to make
the same proffer to the other rancher.</p>
<p>"Tom, will you stand by me--when I come back?"</p>
<p>"Hell, yes," boomed Day as he pumped the cowboy's arm up and
down.</p>
<p>Abruptly, then, with sharp husky expulsion of breath, Jack
wrenched clear of the vigorous grasp and wheeled to a post of the
porch, against which he leaned and clutched hard. Something long
buried was being resurrected. Ignominy loomed out of the past to
stain an honest name. There was sacrifice here, far greater than
appeared plain to the two grave and expectant onlookers. Whatever
the strife was, it passed as swiftly as it had come. Then the
cowboy turned again, somehow different, so that the judge and Day
had awe added to their surprise.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, I shore hate to give myself away," he drawled. A
smile outshone the strange, steely light in his eyes. "But I
reckon it's got to be done."</p>
<p>"Wal now, who'n hell are you, anyhow?" queried Day as the
other paused.</p>
<p>"Tom Day, the starved cowboy you once took pity on, happens to
be Jim Lacy!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c11" id="c11">ELEVEN</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>It was Sunday, and that hour of the afternoon when all the men
off duty at the Franklidge Ranch would be anywhere except round
the bunkhouse. The cowboy, Texas Jack, striding in, was relieved
to find himself alone. He made for his bunk for the purpose of
hurriedly packing his few belongings. An old pair of black chaps
worn thin hung at the head of his bed, with a belt and gun. An
instinct prompted him to throw out his hand. There, as if by
magic, the gun whirled in the air.</p>
<p>"Reckon it was fate," he muttered as he sheathed the gun.
"Somethin' never let me stop practicin' that old draw. Wal,
wal!"</p>
<p>In a few moments he had tied his belongings into a small roll
to fit behind a saddle. His movements were swift, but made as if
he were in a trance. He rose from his knees to gaze around; then
strode out into the rude yet comfortable living room. Something
prompted him to step before the mirror.</p>
<p>"Wal, so long, Texas Jack," he said to the image reflected
there. "Reckon I been almost happy with you. A shave an' hair-cut
will shore say <i>adios</i> to you forever. . . . An' then
there'll be men who'll recognize you as Jim Lacy."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later he rode briskly down a trail that
led into the cedars. He had taken his own saddle, but the horse
he bestrode was one long discarded by the boys at the ranch. Once
under cover of the cedars, the rider pulled his mount to a walk.
It was nineteen miles to Sunshine, and he wanted to reach that
station after dark and board a night train without being
seen.</p>
<p>A melancholy resignation had no power to cramp the
slow-mounting exaltation in Jim Lacy's breast. Once free of the
need to hurry, his mind reverted to the cause of this
extraordinary adventure he had voluntarily accepted. Facts were
cold, hard things. He had hidden his real identity; he had buried
the past; he had risen on stepping-stones of his dead self to
honest useful service; he had earned peace and victory, if not
real happiness; and then, like a thunderbolt from heaven, an
inevitable, irresistible fate had confronted him. What he had
suffered during the moments when Tom Day had talked to Judge
Franklidge about Ben and Hettie Ide! The old wound had not
healed. The old love lived in his heart, stronger for the years
of denial and repression. Jim Lacy rocked in his saddle. No eyes
but those of hawks and prairie-dogs and perhaps a skulking coyote
could see him surrender to his emotion. The old horse walked
slowly down the trail; the west wind blew hot desert fragrance in
the rider's face; the dust arose and the heat beat down.</p>
<p>"Aw, I shore knew it--all these weeks I knew," whispered Jim,
huskily. "Ben come to Arizona to find me! . . . Didn't he comb
California--didn't he send men to all the ranges in the West? . .
. Didn't Tom Day tell me no more'n a month ago--how Ben Ide
wanted to know if he'd ever met a cowboy called Nevada? . . .
That was it--the name Ben gave me--<i>Nevada! . . .</i> He never
forgot. An' at last he come to this wild land. He's married an'
got a baby, they say. Old Amos Ide must have died an' left Ben
rich. Shore it was Ina he married. Yet all that didn't hold him
back."</p>
<p>How terribly sweet and soul-satisfying that knowledge, and yet
somehow bitter! In one tremendous moment of decision it had flung
him back into the past, once more to own an infamous name. It had
destroyed all he had built up. Only through the power of his
dreaded name could he ever bring to successful issue the task he
had set himself. What irony of fate that the fame he hated must
be his open sesame to the rendezvous of the rustlers who were
ruining Ben Ide!</p>
<p>"Like as not in the long-run I'll stop a bullet," he muttered,
harsh in his agitation. "But hardly before I get the job 'most
done. . . . An' shore that'd be better so. Ben would never know I
am Jim Lacy. An' Hettie--<i>she</i> would never know. . . . But I
reckon that's not my kind of luck. Like as not I'll run plumb
into Ben before it's over. An' Hettie, too! . . . O my God! How
sweet an' terrible!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He rode on through the hot waning afternoon, absorbed with the
strife of his soul. A storm, passing in gray-black pall at a
distance, cooled and cleared the atmosphere. Sunset came, a
glorious gold and purple pageant in the west, where it vied with
the wonder of a rainbow, receding with the storm. But Jim Lacy
scarcely took note of these physical manifestations around
him.</p>
<p>When darkness fell he had reached the outskirts of Sunshine,
and he halted under a clump of cottonwoods. Here, removing saddle
and bridle from the horse, he turned it loose. That act seemed to
sever the last thread which bound him to the ranching life he had
followed for long. It had, too, a singular effect upon the
emotions which had beset him. The hour had come when he must plan
his return to the old life. Wherefore he sat down beside his
saddle and pack, and with bowed head and rending of his spirit,
he slipped, as into a long-unused garment, back into the old
personality. And it seemed that the instant this transformation
was consummated his plan for the perilous adventure at hand was
simple and complete. He had only to be Jim Lacy.</p>
<p>The whistle of an approaching freight train inspired him with
an idea more satisfactory than the one of waiting for the
passenger train. He would steal a ride on the freight, thus
obviating any risk of being recognized at the station. To this
end he shouldered his pack and saddle and, hurrying to the
railroad track, which was only a few hundred paces away, he
waited beside the slowly halting train, peering through the gloom
for an empty car. At length it reached him, just as the train
stopped. Jim threw pack and saddle aboard and climbed in.</p>
<p>Daylight found him across the Territory line, in New Mexico.
When the train stopped outside of a town at a water tank, he
threw his baggage out, down over a grassy embankment, and got
off. He had some money, beside the considerable sum Judge
Franklidge had forced him to take. And it was with something of
an old familiar zest that he strolled into the town.</p>
<p>Before encountering any riders or cattlemen Jim entered a
barber shop, from which he emerged a changed man. Next he
purchased a complete new outfit of rider's apparel, the costliest
he could find. Jim Lacy, he remembered, had once affected
something near to dandyism. He retained only his gun and chaps,
which were things more intimate than clothes and were not to be
discarded.</p>
<p>His next move was to buy a good horse. This turned out to be
easier than he had anticipated, and was accomplished without
exciting any particular attention. Lastly he led the horse out of
town, found his saddle and pack, and soon he was riding back
across the line into Arizona.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Traveling leisurely, and stopping at ranches and stations
convenient to the day's travel, Jim Lacy in due time arrived in
Winthrop.</p>
<p>The day was a Friday, toward the close of afternoon. He made
his way to Beacham's corrals, where over-night visitors to town
usually left their horses to be cared for. The first corral
appeared to be a little too crowded for Jim, so he led his animal
out to another and smaller one. Several rangy, dusty-garbed
riders had just ridden in, evidently behind a dilapidated old
wagon drawn by a shaggy gaunt team. The driver, a lanky man, dark
of face and bearded, clambered down with the cramped movements of
one more at home in the saddle. Jim had seen him before, but
could not place him. There was a young girl sitting on the
driver's seat, and she appeared quite pretty, in a wild-rose way.
Jim's quick eye also took in the stock of a rifle projecting from
the side of the seat.</p>
<p>Jim led his horse somewhat closer to the wagon, and choosing
one of the covered stalls adjoining the fence, he leisurely began
to remove the saddle, while his eyes roved elsewhere. He noted
presently, when the girl jumped down, that her slim brown legs
were bare, that she wore beaded moccasins, and the rest of her
apparel showed further indications of the backwoods. As she
passed out of the corral with the bearded man, Jim had a closer
scrutiny.</p>
<p>"Shore, I'll bet that'll be Elam Hatt an' his daughter Rose,"
muttered Jim. "An' if so, those three riders are the other Hatts.
. . . Reckon the ball is openin' <i>pronto</i>."</p>
<p>By the time Jim had turned his horse over to the Mexican
stable-boy the Hatts had gone into town. Jim got out just in time
to see them turn a corner. He followed very slowly, not
reluctantly in any sense, but ponderingly. Familiar as he was
with Winthrop, it did not seem the same town. Turning into the
broad main street, he strolled along, seeing everything while not
appearing to be interested in anything. He passed several persons
whom he knew well. They did not give him a second glance. The
restaurant-keeper, standing in a doorway, did not recognize Jim.
A cowboy came along on his horse, evidently going home. It was
Jerry Smith from Franklidge Ranch. He saw Jim, yet did not look
twice.</p>
<p>"Jerry! An' the son-of-a-gun didn't know me," soliloquized
Jim, elated. "He owes me money I'll never get now. Wal, could I
surprise him?"</p>
<p>The later afternoon hours were the busy ones in the stores of
Winthrop, owing to the heat of midday. The saloons were always
busy, all day and all night. Jim had never entered a saloon in
Winthrop. He would break that record presently, but not just
yet.</p>
<p>At the next corner he came abreast of three cowboys sitting on
a stone step of a saloon.</p>
<p>"Look, Bill, do you see the same as me--somethin' awful
pretty?" asked one.</p>
<p>"By josh! I do," was the jocular reply.</p>
<p>"Boys, anybody'd know there was a dance on tonight--huh?" said
the other.</p>
<p>"Hey, stranger, yore sure steppin' high, wide, an' handsome,"
spoke up the third.</p>
<p>Jim wheeled round to face them, with amusement difficult to
hide. These fine-spirited cowboys were far from being harmless,
but it was only their way to extract fun out of every
incident.</p>
<p>"Wal, are you boys lookin' for a fight or a drink?" he asked,
smiling.</p>
<p>"Since you ask us, stranger, it sure must have been a drink,"
replied the first speaker.</p>
<p>Jim waved them into the saloon, followed them, threw money on
the bar, and said: "On me, boys. Sorry I ain't drinkin' to-day. I
just buried my grandma an' feel bad."</p>
<p>Loud guffaws greeted his sally, and as he walked out through
the swinging doors one of the cowboys yelled, "You're all right,
stranger."</p>
<p>Jim crossed the side street and went on down toward the center
of the main block. He idled along, halting to gaze into windows,
leaned against doorways here and there, watching the people.
Presently he came to the entrance of a store and espied the girl
he had taken for Rose Hatt standing in the door. She had a
package under her arm and was evidently waiting for some one.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, miss," said Jim, doffing his sombrero and stepping
up to her. "Don't I know you?"</p>
<p>She looked up at him with big hazel eyes that had not been
long free of tears.</p>
<p>"You might, mister, but I sure don't know you," she
replied.</p>
<p>Jim decided she was more than pretty and not such a child as
he had first supposed. She had wavy brown hair, rather
rebellious, red lips, and tanned rose-tinted cheeks.</p>
<p>"Aren't you Rose Hatt?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>Jim leaned easily against the doorpost, smiling down upon her.
"Reckon I thought so. Shore that's not many girls as pretty as
you in these parts."</p>
<p>"Put your hat back on, mister," she replied, tartly. "Standin'
bareheaded don't go with such taffy. Besides, I ain't used to
it."</p>
<p>"All right," returned Jim, good-humoredly. "Bad habit of mine.
I'll get sunstruck some day."</p>
<p>"Say, you'll ketch worse if my dad comes along," she said,
laughing, "Onless you tell me <i>pronto</i> who you are."</p>
<p>"Wal, Rose, I might be Samuel Snoozegazzer," drawled Jim.</p>
<p>"Only you ain't," she added, with interest, and she looked Jim
over from boots to sombrero. She was not bold, but she certainly
did not show embarrassment or shyness. Jim gathered that she was
used to men.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you my name if I drop in on the dance tonight," he
said.</p>
<p>"Mister, I knowed that was comin'," she returned. "An' I'll
bet you never met me before."</p>
<p>"Wal, to be honest, I never did."</p>
<p>"Reckon it ain't no difference. But I'm afeared I can't
promise to dance with you."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Dad says I can go, but Cedar--he's my brother--he says no.
An' Cedar is boss of our outfit."</p>
<p>"Wal, if your dad's willin', why, go ahaid. He's your
father."</p>
<p>"Say, mister, I reckon you ain't acquainted with Cedar Hatt,"
declared the girl, almost with scorn. "You're sure a stranger in
these parts."</p>
<p>"Yes, I am, sorry to say," replied Jim, thoughtfully. "But
what's so bad aboot your brother?"</p>
<p>"Cedar's just plain cactus an' side-winder rattlesnake mixed
up with hell."</p>
<p>"Aw, that's a terrible thing to call a brother," rejoined
Jim.</p>
<p>"He's only a half brother, same as Henny an' Tobe."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see! Your dad was married twice an' your ma was the
second."</p>
<p>The girl's eyes grew somber and her red lips curled with
bitterness.</p>
<p>"There're some folks out in the brakes who say my dad wasn't
never married no second time."</p>
<p>"Shore he was, lass. Don't believe gossip of low-down people.
An' don't be so hard on your brother Cedar."</p>
<p>"I hate him," she burst out, with passion.</p>
<p>"Wal! Why do you hate your own kin, little girl? Shore it's
not natural," went on Jim, in his slow, persuasive drawl, so full
of interest and sympathy.</p>
<p>"Reason enough," she retorted. "It was his fault that Clan
Dillon took to runnin' after me."</p>
<p><i>"Dillon!"</i> flashed Jim, in an amaze too swift and deep
to hide.</p>
<p>His tone, his look betrayed to the simple passionate girl that
she had allowed her tongue too much freedom.</p>
<p>"Say, mister, here I am talkin' like an old woman," she cried,
almost in affright. "I'm beggin' you to keep mum that slip of my
tongue. Cedar would half kill me."</p>
<p>"Shore I will," returned Jim, in his former kindly tone.
"Rose, you just happened to run into a man you can trust."</p>
<p>"You look it, mister. I like you," she replied, with
relief.</p>
<p>"Thanks. I'm shore the lucky <i>hombre.</i> But I reckon now
you're engaged to marry this Clan Dillon."</p>
<p>"Marry, hell!" she exclaimed, suddenly almost fierce again. "I
wouldn't marry <i>him</i> to save his life, the handsome,
smilin'-faced liar. Not even if he wanted to, which he sure
don't. I'd be only a sheepskin rug to Clan Dillon."</p>
<p>Jim dropped his head, conscious of an inward shrinking of
tingling nerves, to the coldness of ice. It had come again--that
thing which had not frozen within his breast for years. How life
tracked him down! Then he looked once more at the girl. She was
recovering composure. Manifestly she was a primitive little girl,
as much like a wildcat as a wild rose. Jim felt intuitively that
she was good. The flame left her hazel eyes and the hardness
around her lips softened. Jim did not need to be told more about
her life.</p>
<p>"Rose, have you any friends?" he asked, earnestly. "Shore I
mean women-folks who could advise a young girl like you."</p>
<p>"Me? Why, mister, didn't I tell you I lived down in the
brakes?"</p>
<p>"Haven't you a man friend, then, or even a boy--who's
good?"</p>
<p>"No. But I was makin' one fast enough," she replied, both with
resentment and mischievousness in face and voice. "A boy from
California! Say, he was nice. But Cedar caught me with him."</p>
<p>"Too bad. What'd Cedar do, now?" queried Jim, much
concerned.</p>
<p>"Not much, for Cedar," replied the girl, demurely. "He drove
my boy friend off into the woods, dodgin' bullets! An' he kicked
me till I couldn't set down for days."</p>
<p>"Wal! . . . Look heah, girl, you're old enough an' you've
sense enough to know a friend when you meet him. Aren't you?"</p>
<p>"Mister, I think so. But I--I'm afraid to trust myself," she
faltered, swayed by his earnestness.</p>
<p>"Wal, you needn't be in my case. I'm going to trust you."</p>
<p>"How?" she asked, wonderingly. "I'll tell you presently. I
don't want you to run off scared before I say all I want to. . .
. Now who's this California boy your brother caught you
with?"</p>
<p>"Swear you'll never tell?" she returned, impulsively, drawn by
his potent sympathy.</p>
<p>"Rose, I'll shore keep your secret, an' more. I'll help you to
<i>make</i> a friend of him."</p>
<p>"Oh, mister, if that could be!" she cried, rapturously.</p>
<p>"Hurry. I see your dad comin' down the street."</p>
<p>"His name is Marvie Blaine," she whispered.</p>
<p>Jim Lacy drew a sharp swift breath that seemed to cut him like
a knife as it swelled his breast. He leaned down to the girl.</p>
<p>"Listen," he whispered. "I will be your friend--an' this
boy's--if you'll keep your mouth shut."</p>
<p>"Lord, mister, you needn't be afeared of <i>me,"</i> replied
the girl. "I wouldn't dare. Sure I don't know why I ever talked
to you. But you're different. An' oh! How I need some one to talk
to!"</p>
<p>"Shore you've found some one. Me! I'll be goin' down into the
brakes."</p>
<p>"But who are you, mister?" she queried, aghast at his
assertion.</p>
<p>"Did you ever heah of Jim Lacy?"</p>
<p>Her red lips parted to let out a little gasp and her brown
face paled. "My Heavens--are you him?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Hear of you, Mister Jim Lacy!" she ejaculated, her eyes
dilating. "Ever since I can remember I've heerd of you. Many men
ride to my Dad's ranch, an' none but they speak your name. Some
of them had seen you, an' two of them at least knowed you
once."</p>
<p>"Rose, I'll tell you their names--Hardy Rue an' Cash
Burridge."</p>
<p>"Yes--yes. Oh, you <i>are</i> Jim Lacy. An'--an' I'm not
scared a bit," she whispered. "Why, it ain't so long ago that I
heerd Cash Burridge tell of seein' you call out an' kill a man
for beatin' a girl. . . . Oh, Mister Lacy, no one ever taught me
about God, but I've prayed--prayed night after night--for some
one to come an'--"</p>
<p>"That your Dad right heah?" interrupted Jim.</p>
<p>"Oh yes. . . . What'll I say?"</p>
<p>"Nothin', lass. He hasn't seen us. Don't forget. Keep mum.
Good-by."</p>
<p>Jim strode out as if he were just leaving the store, and he
passed Elam Hatt so close he might have touched him. Hatt was
walking with a man as rough in garb and hard of face as he was
himself. Neither appeared to notice him. After a few steps Jim
glanced back. The girl had disappeared and the men were passing
on.</p>
<p>"Good!" said Jim, to himself. "That lass is game, but she's
only a kid, an' I reckon it's better her dad didn't see her with
me. Wal, wal! The old luck of Jim Lacy! Half an hour in Winthrop
an' I'm on a hot trail."</p>
<p>Marvie Blaine! Marvie--the boy who had worshipped him and Ben
Ide in those wonderful Forlorn River days! Jim had found the boy
way over here in Arizona. Marvie would be eighteen now--quite a
man as cowboys were rated on the ranges. But then Ben and his
family had only arrived at Cedar Springs in July.</p>
<p>"Tall, freckled-faced, tow-haided kid, Marvie was," went on
Jim. "Shore he's straddlin' mean hosses an' packin' a gun. . . .
Reckon it's not the best country for a boy like him. But Ben
could hold him in. . . . By golly! I'm forgettin' Rose Hatt.
Shore as shootin' Marvie has fallen in love with her. No wonder.
Reckon I would, too, if my heart hadn't been eaten up long ago.
Wal, wal! A girl an' a boy I hadn't reckoned on. . . . How queer
things come! Rose said it was Cedar's fault that Clan Dillon . .
. Poor kid! She shore called Dillon. Handsome, smilin'-faced
liar! An' she knows, if I ever saw truth. Wal now, I wonder, just
<i>what</i> kind of a <i>hombre</i> is Ben Ide's foreman. Tom Day
liked him. So does everybody I've ever heard speak of him, except
this Hatt girl. . . . It's a hunch. I'll be damned if I don't
back her against all of them."</p>
<p>Jim strolled the length of the main street, and crossing,
sauntered back again, talking to himself in an undertone, and
with his apparent casual observance taking cognizance of all
visible persons. He had the pleasure of meeting Judge Franklidge
face to face in front of the hotel. The rancher saw Jim only as a
passer-by. It would have been the opposite of pleasure, however,
for Jim to have encountered Ben Ide face to face; and that was
one reason Jim's keen eyes sighted every man first. But accidents
could happen. It would be well for Jim, while in Winthrop, to
keep under cover of the saloons or places not likely to be
frequented by Ben Ide. At most, Jim's hours in town would be few
and far between.</p>
<p>He went to a side-street restaurant to get his supper and
engage lodgings for the night. As darkness came on he ventured
into a store, where he made a few purchases, and then he returned
to the corral for his pack. This he carried to his room.</p>
<p>"Reckon that'll be aboot all," he soliloquized, as he stood
gazing around the dingy bare room.</p>
<p>He was thinking that he had walked the streets of Winthrop
about the last time as an unknown man whom few people had
noticed. Those swift moments--an hour or so at most--had seemed
singularly sweet to Jim.</p>
<p>"Wal, I'm shore ready to pay all it'll take."</p>
<p>The small mirror showed his eyes piercing and light, like
points of daggers gleaming out of shadow. He stood an instant
longer, motionless in the chill lonely silence of the room. He
knew that when he went forth again it must be into raw evil life
of outlaws, gamblers, murderers--all that riffraff of the
Southwest, which like a murky tide, had rolled into Arizona. He
calculated coldly that he must be all he had ever been, all that
his name had ever meant. He must add to these the intelligence
which had sharpened in the years of peace. He seemed fitted for
this task, and his motive had the strength of love and passion
and the sanction of right.</p>
<p>"Reckon I ought to thank God," he said, to his pale image in
the mirror. "Shore I never had no chance to do somethin' worth
while. An' now I can use my evil gifts to a good end. For
Ben--an' that means for <i>her</i>--an' then Franklidge an' all
the honest people who're tryin' to civilize this wild country.
Reckon, after all, they need such men as Jim Lacy. . . . I see
clear now. Even if I'm killed, Ben an' Hettie will know the truth
some day. It's got to come out, an' I reckon I'm glad."</p>
<p>Then before the mirror, with a grim smile on his face, he came
at last to the practical business of the matter. Though the
success of this enterprise depended upon his cunning and his
knowledge of the outlawed men with whom he must throw his
lot--and the more of such qualities he exercised the surer his
chances--the cold hard fact was that all hung upon the deadliness
of his skill with a gun. This job had to do with death. Such was
the wildness of the time and the evil code of outlaws, that he
could kill this one and that one, any number of them, and only
add to his fame, only give himself greater standing among them.
True, by so doing he must make bitter and relentless enemies; he
must face the strange paradox that many an incipient gunman, or
notoriety-seeking desperado, or drunken cowboy would seek to kill
him just because he was Jim Lacy.</p>
<p>Whereupon, with deliberation he treated himself to a tense
exhibition of his swiftness of eye and hand. In secret he had
practiced all through these peaceful months while engaged in
honest labor. An impelling force had exacted this of him. He
understood it now. And with a dark satisfaction he realized that
he had gained in speed, in sureness of hand. Beyond these he had
in large measure the gift peculiar to all gunmen who survived
long in the Southwest--and that gift was to read his opponent's
mind.</p>
<p>"Reckon I might have bit off more'n I can chew," soliloquized
Jim, as he sheathed his gun. "But from the minute I step out this
heah door I shore won't be makin' many mistakes."</p>
<p>The Lincoln County war in New Mexico had ended recently. It
had been the blackest and bloodiest fight between rustlers and
cattlemen and many others who had been drawn into the vortex,
that had ever been recorded in the frontier history of the
Southwest. As such it had possessed an absorbing, even a morbid,
interest for Jim Lacy. He had never lost an opportunity to hear
or read something about this war. And once he had ridden into New
Mexico on a cattle mission for Franklidge, during which trip he
had seen at first hand some of the places and men who were later
to become notorious. That war had in its beginning something
analogous to the present situation here in Arizona. Jim did not
believe there could ever again be such a fight as the Lincoln
County war. But there was no telling. Arizona had vaster ranges
and more cattle. Some of the characters prominent in the Lincoln
County war had not been killed. They had disappeared. It was not
unreasonable to suppose that one or more of them had drifted into
Arizona. "No two-bit of a rustler is headin' that Pine Tree
outfit!" ejaculated Jim, voicing aloud one of his thoughts. To be
sure, Billy the Kid, the deadliest of all the real desperadoes of
the Southwest, had fallen in the Lincoln fight, along with the
worst of his gang. But they had not all bitten the bloody dust of
New Mexico.</p>
<p>"Shore I'll run into some one from over there," muttered Jim.
"When I do I'll shoot first an' ask questions after."</p>
<p>With that he opened the door, to step out into the dark,
oppressive August night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c12" id="c12">TWELVE</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Winthrop, the same as many other Western towns of the period,
supported more saloons than all other kinds of business houses
combined. It had a vast area of range land to draw from; and if
there were a thousand cowboys and cattlemen in this section,
there were probably an equal number of parasites who lived off
them, from the diamond-shirted saloon-keeper and frock-coated
gambler with all their motley associates, down to the rustler who
hid in the brakes and the homesteader who branded as many calves
not his own as he raised from his stock.</p>
<p>Once a month, if not oftener, the men of the range could be
depended upon to visit town, "to paint it red" and "buck the
tiger." These customs were carried out as regularly as the work
of punching cows.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During the early evening hours Jim Lacy visited some of the
main-street saloons, steering clear of the Ace High and others of
prominence. He lounged about the bars and tables, agreeable and
friendly to anyone who wanted to talk, willing to buy cigars and
drinks, while he made some excuse or other for not indulging at
the time. Cowboys were all friendly folk, except now and then one
whom drink made mean. Gamblers and hangers-on, Mexicans and
Indians, attracted by Jim's liberality and presence, added their
little to the sum of information he was gathering.</p>
<p>"I'm lookin' for a pard," Jim would say to most everyone he
met. "A cowboy who broke jail over in New Mexico." And then he
went on with more of such fabrication, always to conclude with
questions. Cowboys under the influence of a few strong drinks
soon acquainted him with range gossip he had not heard. Several
<i>habitués</i> of these dives accepted Jim's advances without
telling him anything. These, of course, were the men who knew
most and required cultivation. But they only eyed him covertly.
Bartenders were mostly procurers for this or that gambling house,
and from them he amassed much information. At length he left the
last resort, intending to hunt up the dance hall.</p>
<p>"Shore, that wasn't so bad for a start," mused Jim as he
summed up and sifted the bits of talk in which he found
significance. "Cash Burridge, sold out an' gamblin' his fortune
away, spends half his time heah in town. Thick with some Spanish
girl. Same old Cash! . . . Clan Dillon one grand <i>hombre,</i>
eh? Wal, wal! The Ides rich Californians who're bein' rustled an'
sheeped off their range. Tom Day just as liable to be boss of the
Pine Tree outfit as any one. That'll shore tickle Tom. The Hatt
outfit, except Cedar, just no-good homesteaders, low-down enough
for anythin' not really big an' dangerous. Cedar Hatt, though, is
a plumb bad man. Not the even-break kind, but crafty as a
redskin, treacherous as a Greaser. The Stillwells hardest nuts
down in the brakes. Never come to town! Now that's shore worth
rememberin'. Last an' perhaps meanin' most to me--what that
half-drunk sheepherder told me. Strange riders often seen by
herders passin' through the Mogollons. Wal, most of all this
sounds familiar, as I think back. But now it comes close."</p>
<p>Jim, by following in the footsteps of hurrying young people,
soon found where the dance was being held. It was out a side
street, almost at the edge of town, in a low wide adobe building,
very picturesque now with its hanging colored lanterns, its
trailing vines over archways. Outside there was a crowd of
Mexicans, Indians, white men in rough garb, noisy boys, all
looking in through the archways at the couples walking down the
long patio and the dancers inside, swaying to and fro with the
music. There was something of the spirit of a <i>fiesta</i> in
the air.</p>
<p>Upon entering the place Jim was aware that he came under the
scrutiny of men who evidently were conducting the dance, or at
least overseeing those who entered. One of these individuals was
Macklin, the sheriff of Winthrop, an officer who arrested cowboys
sometimes, and Indians and Mexicans, but who never had been known
to jail a gambler or one of the more dangerous characters. Jim,
however, was not questioned. He strolled up the wide steps to
watch the dancers, and then moving from one vantage point to
another, amused and pleased with the scene, he at length found a
place that suited him, where he sat down to watch and listen.</p>
<p>Jim Lacy, in the old Texas and Idaho, even the Nevada days,
had enjoyed dancing, but since his advent in Arizona he had never
attended a dance. This had been one of the peculiar things about
Jim that had puzzled his cowboy associates of the Franklidge
Ranch. Failing to persuade him, they called him a
woman-hater.</p>
<p>It did not take Jim long to appreciate that this dance was
conducted on proper lines. He understood now why he had been so
closely scrutinized at the entrance. There was no drinking
permitted on this occasion, nor any obstreperous behavior. The
cowboys and other young men present did not show any evidence of
the bottle. Among the dancers, and promenaders in the patio,
there were a number of dark-haired, flower-decorated Mexican
girls, very bright and pretty in their festal array. It was
indeed a gala occasion, full of color and life, and soft laughter
and Spanish music. Jim had to admit that his calculations had
fallen awry in this case. Rose Hatt might be in attendance, but
it was a safe wager that Cedar Hatt would not be admitted, nor
any of the men Jim wanted to watch, unless it might be Dillon.
He, surely, would not only be welcome, but very probably the lion
of the dance.</p>
<p>Presently Jim believed he had caught a glimpse of little Rose
Hatt at the far end of the patio. So he arose to walk in that
direction, and found it rather a running of the gauntlet, for as
the music started up couples began gayly to hasten to the dancing
floor. More than one pretty girl bumped into Jim's right side
where his gun hung low. Finally another, dodging around a couple
she evidently wanted to get ahead of, plumped into Jim's
arms.</p>
<p>"Oh, goodness! Excuse me," she giggled, recovering her
balance.</p>
<p>"See heah, lady, are you shore you didn't mean that?" drawled
Jim, with a smile.</p>
<p>She could not very well have grown redder of face, so Jim
could not tell whether or not she blushed. There was, however, a
hint of coquetry in her merry eyes. Then a tall cowboy, very
young in years, loomed over her and glowered at Jim.</p>
<p>"Hey, you dressed-up quirt!" he said. "You say 'lady,' but you
don't know one when you see her. I've a notion to slap your
smart-alec face."</p>
<p>"I'd hate to be slapped, so I beg pardon, sonny," replied Jim,
and walked away.</p>
<p>The momentary halt had caused him to lose track of the dark
curly head he had believed to be Rose Hatt's. At the end of the
patio he turned, to espy the girl just stepping out upon the
floor. It was indeed Rose, and a transformed little girl, too.
She had on a gaudy, cheap, flimsy dress, with shoes and stockings
to match, but these did not detract from her prettiness. She was
young and radiant. Her partner was a cowboy not much older than
herself. They stood a moment, holding to each other,
self-conscious and awkward, before they began to dance. Rose did
not know how to waltz, but she made a valiant effort.</p>
<p>Jim watched the couple until they were lost in the whirl of
dancers. This end of the patio opened into a garden or yard where
a walk wound between clumps of shrubbery. There were benches here
and there, and some of these were overshadowed by vines. Jim
watched the dancers, hoping to see Rose again, and perhaps catch
her eye. But he missed her in the whirling throng, and when the
dance ended he retreated to a seat on the adobe wall. Then again
the dancers tripped to and fro, hurrying for refreshments and
seats, and the wide aisle was filled with murmuring voices.</p>
<p>This scene roused in Jim Lacy a strange regret. The pleasure
and life manifested here were things he had missed. "I can't see
that it was my fault, either," he muttered. Young couples passed
near, excited and gay, thoughtless, enchanted with the moment.
There were older people, some with gray hair, and they did not
seem beyond the magic of the hour. Jim's envy was short-lived.
Happiness had eluded him. But it was not given to many men to
serve as he could now.</p>
<p>Presently a couple approached out of the shadow. As they
reached a point beyond, yet near where Jim sat, half concealed,
the girl halted.</p>
<p>"Please--let's go outside," begged the man.</p>
<p>His voice prompted Jim to turn so that he could see better.
The fellow had the build of a rider, lithe, tall, wide in the
shoulders. He wore a dark suit and had a flower in the lapel of
his coat. His face had a compelling attraction. But Jim, in his
quick glance, could not decide whether it drew him because it was
a handsome, unusual face, or for some other reason difficult to
grasp at the moment.</p>
<p>"No, Mr. Dillon, I don't care to go farther," said the
girl.</p>
<p>Jim started so violently that he almost fell off the low adobe
wall. That voice! He would have known it among a thousand voices.
His cool curiosity vanished in a rushing tide of emotion. His
glance leaped from the man to his companion. She stood full in
the soft rose light of one of the colored lanterns. Hettie Ide!
His heart bounded, then seemed to become locked with a terrible
pang. It was Hettie, grown into a woman. The face that had
haunted Jim's camp fires in the lonely watches of the nights! The
same rippling fair hair, the deep earnest eyes, the rich clear
complexion that spoke of contact with the open, the strong full
lips, more hauntingly sweet than ever for the sadness which had
come!</p>
<p>So rapt, so agonizing was Jim's attention that he lost
something of the words which passed between the two. It was the
name Dillon that roused Jim from his trance.</p>
<p>"Mr. Dillon," she was saying, "the reason I can't marry you is
that I don't love you."</p>
<p>"But, Hettie, you will--you must love me in time," he
returned, passionately, seizing her hand and trying to pull her
into the shadow. She resisted, broke away from him.</p>
<p>"I never will," she said, with eyes and cheeks flaming. "What
kind of a man are you--that you persist so rudely? I liked
you--even admired you until you forced such attentions as these
on me. I've overlooked them because my brother Ben thinks so much
of you. But no more, Mr. Dillon."</p>
<p>Her dignified yet spirited reply might as well not have been
spoken, for all the effect it had to restrain Dillon. He burst
into low impassioned appeal, and he backed her under the
overhanging vines against the wall. Dillon was no young cowboy,
mad with love. He appeared to be a man, masterful, adept at
making love, absolutely indifferent to anything but his own
desires. The way he confronted her in her several attemps to pass
him, and without laying a hand on her crowded her back to the
wall, proved how he was thinking about what he was doing.</p>
<p>"I--I thought you were a gentleman," she burst out.</p>
<p>"No man thinks of bein' over-gentle when he's in love,"
retorted Dillon. "I tried that with you. And to tell you the
truth, I wasn't so natural then as I am now. I've plumb lost my
head. I tell you I love you an' I'm goin' to have you. What do
you say to that?"</p>
<p>"I say this, Mr. Dillon, we've all got you figured wrong," she
retorted.</p>
<p>"Sure you have," he rejoined, with an exultant laugh. "An'
here's how!" With that he attempted to seize her in his arms. But
he had evidently cornered the wrong girl. Supple and strong, she
wrestled free in an instant and wheeled away from the wall.</p>
<p>"What do you--think--Ben will do--when I tell him--you've
insulted me?" she panted, backing into the aisle.</p>
<p>"If you've got any sense you won't tell him," replied Dillon,
in a flash changing from an ardent lover to something almost
menacing. "Ben Ide's in bad here. Arizona isn't California. There
are rustlers here an' you can bet some of them are the ranchers
he thinks his friends. I know this cattle game. I know these men.
He's lost most of his stock. If he buys in more he'll lose that
too. Hettie, I'm the only cowman in Arizona who can save him from
ruin."</p>
<p>"Indeed! Are you aware that I have a share in the Ide ranch?"
retorted Hettie, sarcastically.</p>
<p>"I've heard so, but I didn't believe."</p>
<p>"Well, it's true."</p>
<p>"Ahuh! What do you mean by share?" he queried, curiously.</p>
<p>"I own one third of the land and the stock. Besides, I have my
own house apart from Ben."</p>
<p>"That's news to me," said Dillon. "But it sure makes my case
stronger. What ruins Ben Ide will ruin you."</p>
<p>"The loss of a few thousand cattle won't hurt either my
brother or me," she returned, almost flippantly, studying his
face with steady, penetrating eyes. She was seeing the man as if
he had suddenly unmasked.</p>
<p>"You must be pretty rich to talk like that," replied
Dillon.</p>
<p>"Quite well off, thank you. I often wondered if that didn't
interest you, and now I know."</p>
<p>He laughed in a way that would have been a revelation to an
older woman, well versed in the life of the frontier. But Hettie
did not grasp what seemed as plain as print to Jim Lacy,
crouching like a tiger under the shadow.</p>
<p>"Thanks, you're very smart," he said. "But I'd be crazy about
you if you were as poor as Rose Hatt. I tell you I love you--want
you--need you so terribly that if I fail to get you it'll make a
devil out of me."</p>
<p>"I'm beginning to imagine the process of <i>making</i> has
progressed very far already."</p>
<p>"You've got cat in you--same as other women," he retorted.
"Listen, we're wastin' talk. If you'll marry me I'll save Ben
Ide. If you won't I'll quit him an' use my influence all over the
range. I'll make ranchin' impossible for him in this country. An'
I'll get <i>you</i> in the bargain."</p>
<p>Hettie Ide turned so pale that her eyes shone black.</p>
<p>"Mr. Clan Dillon! Popular fellow! Splendid cattleman! Best and
squarest foreman in Arizona!" she exclaimed, with amazed and
infinite scorn.</p>
<p>Dillon, whose back was now turned toward Jim, made a
deprecatory gesture in reply.</p>
<p>"Mr. Dillon, weeks ago when you first came to us and began
your--your attentions to me, I thought there was something queer
about you," went on Hettie, deliberately. "You were too good to
be true, as old Raidy said. Well, I think you're as bad as you
seemed good. I think you're a contemptible, conceited ass. I
think you're a deep, cunning scoundrel. . . . You need not return
to Cedar Springs tomorrow. Marvie Blaine will drive me Home."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Dillon.</p>
<p>"You'll not get a chance to quit Ben. Right here and now
you're discharged."</p>
<p>"Me! What? Who's dischargin' me?"</p>
<p>"I am."</p>
<p>"Bah! You're loco, girl. Ben Ide wouldn't listen to you. He
can't run that ranch without me. Haven't you sense enough to see
it?"</p>
<p>Hettie Ide abruptly turned her back upon Dillon and walked
away, to disappear in the crowd of dancers returning to the
floor.</p>
<p>"--damn the luck!" muttered Dillon. He lighted a cigarette and
stood thoughtfully inhaling and expelling smoke.</p>
<p>Jim Lacy strode out from under the vines and the shadow.</p>
<p>"Howdy, Dillon!" he said, as he confronted the foreman.</p>
<p>A lightning-swift glance took Jim in from head to feet and
back again.</p>
<p>"Howdy, yourself. Reckon you've got the best of me," returned
Dillon, gruffly.</p>
<p>"Shore, I reckon I have," drawled Jim, with cool
significance.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" queried Dillon, sharply.</p>
<p>"I might be Peter Punkins--only I ain't."</p>
<p>"Pretty smart, aren't you?" rejoined Dillon, feeling his way.
He knew men; he knew the West. "Reckon you're more Simple Simon
than Peter Punkins. I don't care. But I'm curious about where you
just sprung from."</p>
<p>"Wal, I hail from New Mexico," returned Jim.</p>
<p>"The hell you do!" flashed Dillon. "That's nothin' to me. But
where'd you come from just now?"</p>
<p>"Dillon, you're figurin' quick," returned Jim, in slow
deliberation. "Wal, I was settin' right heah on the adobe
wall."</p>
<p>Jim pointed to the spot in the shadow, but he did not take his
gaze off Dillon.</p>
<p>The man cursed under his breath and flung his cigarette down
so hard that the sparks flew from the stone pavement.</p>
<p>"You set there watchin'--listenin'?" he demanded, with sudden
and powerful self-control.</p>
<p>"Shore did," drawled Jim.</p>
<p>"Stranger, where I come from men got shot for such
offense."</p>
<p>"I reckon. That's why I'm not apologizin'."</p>
<p>Dillon seemed to accept this as confirmation of the suspicion
which had evidently been growing with his thoughts. Abruptly his
bullying manner changed. The swift retreat of his personality was
almost as remarkable as the new one which took its place. He
stood unmasked, as far as his pretense was concerned. Cautious,
steady, cold, and hard he stood a moment, his strange green eyes
trying to pierce Jim's mind. He was searching more for Jim's
intent than for other knowledge of him.</p>
<p>As for Jim, he measured Dillon to be a Westerner vastly
different from the character he enjoyed in the section of
Arizona. He judged Dillon without recourse to the words of Rose
Hatt. Jim did not recognize a kindred spirit, but he read in
Dillon the depth, the courage, the desperate experience of a man
used to the rawest and deadliest of frontier life.</p>
<p>"Ha! I see you pack a gun, stranger," coolly remarked Dillon,
as he lighted another cigarette.</p>
<p>"Yes. I got sort of used to it."</p>
<p>"Reckon you see I don't?"</p>
<p>"Shore. I seen first off you didn't, an' then just now I read
it in your eyes."</p>
<p>"Mind-reader, eh? Well, it's a helpin' trait for some
men."</p>
<p>"Are you meanin' any particular breed?" queried Jim,
dryly.</p>
<p>"Yes. Spies, gamblers, thieves, gun-throwers, an' the
like."</p>
<p>"Thanks. I'm shore appreciatin' the way you speak. An' not
wantin' to be outdone in compliments, I'll just repeat what Miss
Hettie Ide called you--a conceited ass! A deep, cunnin'
scoundrel!"</p>
<p>"You heard all she said?" snarled Dillon. Deep and crafty as
he was, he could not help the risk of passion, though he
controlled it.</p>
<p>"Shore. An' I never heard a low-down man called more proper.
Tickled me more because only to-day some one called you a
handsome, smilin'-faced liar."</p>
<p>"Aho! You happened to hear a good deal, now didn't you,
stranger?" returned Dillon. "Well, I don't care a damn."</p>
<p>"Shore you don't. A skunk stinks so bad that nothin' but
bullets can get to his hide."</p>
<p>"You're a brave man, stranger, shoutin' that way above your
gun. But I'm tired listenin'. Are you from New Mexico?"</p>
<p>"No. I was lyin'."</p>
<p>"Ahuh? An' you've got a hunch that's where I come from?"</p>
<p>"I reckon."</p>
<p>"You see I don't deny it. What do I care what you know or
think or do? You pose for a dandy cowboy. But you're not ridin'
for any outfit around Winthrop. You excite a little suspicion
yourself, mister, considerin' this country is full of outlaws an'
rustlers."</p>
<p>"It shore is. That's why I come over," returned Jim,
meaningly.</p>
<p>For the first time the dark red showed in Dillon's face.</p>
<p>"I'll have you put out of here," he said. "An' I'll tip
Macklin off that you need watchin'."</p>
<p>"Wal," drawled Jim, with his glance cold and set, "go ahaid,
but be sure to tip him off that I'm Jim Lacy."</p>
<p>Dillon's stalwart frame jerked with a perceptible tremor. A
slow pale shade began to blot out the brown of his face.</p>
<p>"Jim Lacy, eh! Say, I've had that dodge worked on me before.
Paradin' under a dead man's name! It's an old trick of
four-flushers."</p>
<p>But Dillon was not so cocksure as his bluster was intended to
indicate. His iron nerve had been pierced. Here was a name to
conjure with. For a moment the revelation of it unmasked him as
had nothing else. Honest men seldom had anything to fear from Jim
Lacy or any other of his class. It was only a sudden, instinctive
fear at that, a weakening at once controlled. Dillon might have
been afraid of a name, but not of any man.</p>
<p>"You expect me to believe you're Jim Lacy?" he demanded,
hoarsely.</p>
<p>"Wal, I'm tellin' you, but it's nothin' to me what you
believe," returned Jim, icily. This interview was about to
conclude.</p>
<p>"All right," went on Dillon, breathing hard. "But I still
figure you a liar."</p>
<p>Jim sprang forward and knocked Dillon down.</p>
<p>"Wal, shore it may take more'n that," he said, in slow
accents. "But I told you who I am. An' that's somethin' you
didn't tell me."</p>
<p>Dillon cautiously arose on his hand, lifting a dark face to
his assailant. But he made no response.</p>
<p>Jim, wheeling away to go, found himself confronted by Rose
Hatt. The girl had seen at least the last of Jim's encounter with
Dillon.</p>
<p>"Oh--mister!" she cried, in a comprehension bounded by
fear.</p>
<p>The dancers were trooping off the floor. A tall youth, with
features strangely familiar to Jim, appeared behind Rose. She
clasped his arm, while she stared from Jim to Dillon, who had not
attempted to get up. Without a word Jim hurried on.</p>
<p>"My--God! Who was that?" called out some one Jim took to be
the youth with Rose. The voice added to the stirring of Jim
Lacy's memory. It also urged him faster through the throng of
dancers and out into the street.</p>
<p>"That was Marvie Blaine, God bless him!" whispered Jim, as he
gained the darkness. "Shore a close shave for me."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was eleven o'clock when Jim Lacy entered the Ace High
Saloon, at the period one of the noted gambling hells of the
southwest.</p>
<p>John Brennan, its proprietor, had two unique characteristics
that stood in his favor. He had the reputation of being a square
gambler and he would not have a woman about the place.
Consequently he was not so prosperous as most men of his business
and his house was without costly and gaudy fittings. He did not
bar any man from his tables, so long as that man played fairly.
More than one crooked gambler had been carried out of the Ace
High, feet first. This fact was reported to have had its effect
upon the intent-eyed, still-faced sharps who frequented the
rooms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jim Lacy bolted into the barroom like a man who was being
pursued. He was, indeed, though not by any visible thing.</p>
<p>"Cowboy, what you runnin' from?" queried a tall man. He
happened to be standing nearest to the door, his back to the bar,
his high hat tipped back, to expose a weather-beaten face. A
brass shield, with letters printed upon it, stood out prominently
on his vest.</p>
<p>Jim recognized this individual almost instantly.</p>
<p>"Howdy, Macklin!" he said, nonchalantly. "I was just runnin'
from a sheriff."</p>
<p>"Wal, you run right into another," growled Macklin, surprised
and annoyed. "Who air you?"</p>
<p>"I'm foreman of the Coffee Pot outfit," drawled Jim.</p>
<p>"What's your handle, smarty? It jest happens there ain't any
Coffee Pot outfit at this particular time. . . . I've a notion to
clap you into the jug. You look kinda pale round the gills. What
have you been up to an' who air you?"</p>
<p>"None of your damn business," returned Jim, with abrupt change
of tone and manner. "But if you hang around I reckon somebody'll
tell you."</p>
<p>"Hyar, you come right along with--"</p>
<p>"<i>Lookout, Mack</i>!" interrupted some one behind Jim. A
glass went crash on the floor, and the rasp of heavy boots
followed. Then a man strode in front of the sheriff, facing Jim.
"Excuse me, stranger, but I believe I know you. If I'm wrong, say
so."</p>
<p>"Howdy, Cash!" returned Jim, extending his hand.</p>
<p>Cash Burridge looked a full ten years older than when Jim had
last seen him. Drink and hard life and evil passion had broken
the man. His lined dark visage lost its set expression of
uncertainty, almost alarm, and worked convulsively into a broad
smile.</p>
<p>"Jumpin' steers!" he ejaculated, grasping Jim's hand in both
his and wagging it vigorously. His smile kept on expanding. His
eyes lighted. "If it ain't you!"</p>
<p>"Shore is, Cash. Just got in, an' am lookin' for trouble."</p>
<p>"No! <i>Who?"</i> queried Burridge, with a sudden check to his
almost boisterous welcome. He had bent forward and lowered his
voice.</p>
<p>"Wal, nobody in particular, Cash. I just feel mean."</p>
<p>"I'm a son-of-a-gun! It's you--changed a lot. Most in
disposition--if it's true. You're <i>lookin'</i> for
trouble."</p>
<p>Here the sheriff interposed by placing an ungentle hand on
Burridge's shoulder and turning him somewhat.</p>
<p>"Friend of yours, hey? Thet's no guarantee to keep him out of
jail."</p>
<p>"Hell!" exploded Burridge. "I'm tryin' to keep <i>you</i> out
of the boneyard. My Gawd! if I told you who this man is you'd
sweat blood."</p>
<p>Macklin's jaw dropped and he swayed back against the bar,
dominated by Burridge's fierce sincerity. Then Burridge drew Jim
aside from the gaping, grinning bystanders at the bar and the
gamesters at the tables.</p>
<p>"It's you--really <i>you,</i> Jim?" he whispered, huskily.</p>
<p>"Shore, Cash. Cain't you see?"</p>
<p>"But we heard you were dead."</p>
<p>"That was terrible exaggerated, Cash."</p>
<p>"Dropped from the sky! Jim Lacy, just down from heaven, huh?
Well, I'm damned! . . . An' I never was so glad to see a man in
my life. Honest, Jim."</p>
<p>"Wal, I'm glad to see you, Cash, though we was never very
thick."</p>
<p>"Where you been, Jim, since you left Lineville? Lord! I never
forgot that night you shot Link Cawthorne's eye out."</p>
<p>"Wal, Cash, never mind where I've been."</p>
<p>"Sure, that doesn't matter, only I always had my idea, an' I
was curious. I had a hunch you went to New Mexico an' got mixed
up in that Lincoln County war. <i>Some</i> of those
<i>hombres</i> got out of that fight alive. I know one of them
did. Close pard of Billy the Kid."</p>
<p>"Who?" queried Jim.</p>
<p>"I'm not givin' any man away, Jim. Sure wouldn't have said as
much as that to anyone else. When'd you drift in?"</p>
<p>"To-day."</p>
<p>"You'll be recognized here."</p>
<p>"Shore. I expect to be an' I'm not carin'."</p>
<p>"Lord! Jim, have you grown reckless with the years? You look
older, but fine, healthy, an' prosperous."</p>
<p>"Who's goin' to recognize me, Cash?"</p>
<p>"You remember Ace Black? He's the gambler we knowed at the
Gold Mine back in Lineville."</p>
<p>"Shore I remember Black."</p>
<p>"He's upstairs playing faro. Reckon Black will know you, but
he'd never give you away. Hardy Rue, though. He will. He never
cottoned to you. Always had a hunch you'd killed Less Setter. Rue
has dogged me all these years. An' I'm layin' it to him that I'm
down on my luck now."</p>
<p>"Wal, what come of your ranchin' deal heah, Cash?"</p>
<p>"Jim, you had me figured. I couldn't stand prosperity,"
returned Burridge, heavily. "But I swear I went straight till I
got in need of money. I'd made poor deals. I could steal cattle
an' make money, but not by tradin' or ranchin'. I began to
borrow. Then I had a chance to sell out to Ben Ide, a
Californian. I did him dirt, an' I've lived to be sorry. There's
a man, Jim. . . . Well, when I was flush again I began to drink
an' buck the tiger."</p>
<p>"An' now you're aboot broke. Who got all that money,
Cash?"</p>
<p>"Aw, everybody. Brennan some, but then I don't begrudge it to
him. Hardy Rue beat me out of most of it. I fell in love with a
Spanish girl here. She an' Rue double-crossed me. Got my
pile!"</p>
<p>"Wal, why didn't you kill him?"</p>
<p>"I couldn't try an even break with Rue. An' I never had a
chance to shoot him in the back."</p>
<p>"Is Rue heah now?" asked Jim.</p>
<p>"Reckon he's with that black-eyed hussy. It's a little early
for him to drop in. Lord! it'll tickle me to have him see you
with me. Rue was afraid of you, Jim, an' you need to watch
him."</p>
<p>"Where do you hang out, Cash?"</p>
<p>"I've been most here in town," replied Burridge. "I've a cabin
down in the brakes."</p>
<p>"Are you acquainted down there?"</p>
<p>"Sure am, Jim. Know everybody except the newcomers. An' I'm
givin' you a hunch there's some hard customers driftin' in. It's
a hell of a rough country an' big as all outdoors. I sure learned
to love Arizona."</p>
<p>"Wal, Cash, when you was rich an' high-handed I didn't have
much use for you," said Jim, with a smile. "But now you're broke
an' down on your luck, I reckon I'll chip in with you."</p>
<p>"Jim Lacy! You always was a queer one," returned Burridge,
feelingly. "Reckon, I know you've got somethin' up your sleeve,
an' whatever it is, I'm sure with you."</p>
<p>"All right, Cash. Suppose you tote me round to look 'em
over."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c13" id="c13">THIRTEEN</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Hettie Ide had attended the dance at Winthrop as a guest of
Alice Franklidge, a girl of nineteen, daughter of the judge's
second wife. She was a frank, breezy, Western girl to whom Hettie
took a liking, and they were on the way to become real
friends.</p>
<p>They left the dance before midnight, to be driven out to the
Franklidge house by Alice's escort. The night was cold and clear,
with myriads of blinking stars overhead. Hettie removed her hat
to let the cool wind blow her hair.</p>
<p>"Did you enjoy your first dance in Arizona?" asked the young
rancher.</p>
<p>"Yes indeed I did, Mr. Van Horn--in spite of a--a rather
unpleasant incident," replied Hettie.</p>
<p>"Sure, we're awful glad. Sorry, too, somethin' annoyed you.
But honest, the dances now are Sunday-school affairs to what they
once was. Isn't that so, Alice?"</p>
<p>"It is. I used to be afraid to go," replied the girl. "Fights
were common. One for each dance! They're really nice now. Dad and
some of the town men have seen to that. . . . Hettie, it
mortifies me that you were annoyed by--by Clan Dillon. I know it
was he. You danced with him--then came back to us all flushed and
nervous."</p>
<p>"Yes, it was Mr. Dillon. He--he insulted me."</p>
<p>Van Horn cracked his whip over the horses in rather abrupt and
forceful action.</p>
<p>"I'm not surprised," returned Alice, thoughtfully. "Dillon is
a handsome, fascinating man. Very agreeable, winning. But I
always thought him a little common and bold."</p>
<p>"Who was the pretty girl Marvie paid so much attention to?"
asked Hettie.</p>
<p>"I didn't notice her. But I saw he was having a grand
time."</p>
<p>"He had her with him just before we left," went on Hettie.
"She wore a white muslin dress, cotton stockings, cheap slippers
too large for her feet. She hung back as Marvie came up to me. I
think she was afraid to meet us. I thought her very pretty. Big
staring dark eyes. Red lips. Curly brown hair."</p>
<p>"That was Rose Hatt," replied Van Horn.</p>
<p>"Rose Hatt? She couldn't belong to that notorious Hatt family
we hear about?" asked Alice.</p>
<p>"There's only one family of Hatts, Alice, an' Rose is the only
girl," explained the young rancher. "I'd seen her before. Charley
Moss danced with her. Pretty kid. An' she seemed modest an'
quiet. Young Blaine sure acted smitten with her."</p>
<p>"Indeed he did," corroborated Hettie, seriously. "Marvie is
such a fine boy. But he's going a little wild. I've remonstrated
with Ben, who lets Marvie run around too freely."</p>
<p>"Hettie, love affairs in Arizona go like fire in the dry
desert grass," said Alice, with a little laugh. <i>"You</i> want
to watch out, doesn't she, Frank?"</p>
<p>"Sure won't do her any good to watch out," returned Van Horn,
gayly. "One of our Arizona lads is goin' to get her."</p>
<p>"Mr. Van Horn, that's the second time to-night I've heard such
prediction," replied Hettie, pleasantly. "I'm sure I feel
flattered."</p>
<p>Soon they arrived at the Franklidge home, which stood on a
bench of high ground, among stately pine trees. The girls went in
to find Judge Franklidge smoking beside an open fireplace. He
greeted Hettie warmly.</p>
<p>"Did you meet your brother?" he asked, as he placed a chair
for her.</p>
<p>"No. Did he come in, after all?"</p>
<p>"Yes. He was here for an hour," replied the judge. "Came in to
talk over a cattle deal. I advised him not to buy more stock just
now."</p>
<p>"Was Ina with Ben?" asked Hettie.</p>
<p>"Sure was, and she looked powerful handsome. I wanted them to
stay here overnight. But Ben said he'd rather go to the hotel, so
he could be in town early. Left word if he didn't see you at the
dance that you were to meet him tomorrow at noon sharp. At
Brydon's."</p>
<p>"Goodness! I'm glad we got away from the dance before Ben
arrived," exclaimed Hettie, with a rather unmirthful laugh.</p>
<p>"Well now, you don't say?" queried the judge, lowering his
head to gaze at her over his glasses.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid it's going to be embarrassing for me when I see
Ben. I'll have to tell him I--I discharged Dillon."</p>
<p>"Dillon! Clan Dillon? Did you fire <i>him?"</i> asked the
judge, sitting up abruptly.</p>
<p>"I sure did," rejoined Hettie.</p>
<p>"I'll be darned. What for, lass?"</p>
<p>"I had reason enough, though I'm afraid Ben may not see it
that way. He swears by Dillon. In fact he trusts Dillon
implicitly and entertains a very high opinion of him. Well, Mr.
Dillon has made it rather hard for me out at the ranch. He
waylays me whenever I go outdoors. At first he didn't do me the
honor to offer marriage. But finally he got that far along, and
despite my refusals he kept at it. I did not know he was to be at
the dance to-night, or I wouldn't have gone. But I danced with
him, and walked with him, on the terrace--and--well, to make it
short he insulted me."</p>
<p>"Dad, I'm not surprised. I never liked Dillon," interposed
Alice.</p>
<p>At that juncture Frank Van Horn entered.</p>
<p>"Lass, now just how did Dillon insult you?" asked Judge
Franklidge, with fire in his eye.</p>
<p>"He declared he was going to have me whether I wanted it or
not, and I had to fight him!"</p>
<p>"You don't mean he dared to lay a hand on you?" demanded the
old rancher.</p>
<p>"Both hands, and arms, too," laughed Hettie, though she
blushed as she admitted it. "In fact, he was a ruffian. I imagine
Dillon has had his way with a certain kind of women. I think he
expected me to squeal, or beg--then flop into his arms. But I'm
strong and I broke away from him."</p>
<p>"Damned hound! Somebody ought to use a quirt on him,"
ejaculated the judge, growing red in the face.</p>
<p>"I'd suggest a gun," added Van Horn, with a compression of his
lips.</p>
<p>Hettie held back a revelation of Dillon's threat to ruin Ben
and herself. Upon cool reflection she had not been sure of how
Ben would react to her taking upon herself the authority to
discharge Dillon. Unfortunately, Ben was used to Hettie's
complaints about the attentions his men bestowed upon her, and he
had come to take them with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>"So I discharged Dillon," concluded Hettie.</p>
<p>"You did right, lass, but how in the devil is Ben going to
take that?" queried Franklidge, seriously. "He thinks a heap of
this Dillon. Only to-night he was bragging about Dillon's
recovery of a bunch of cattle that'd just been rustled off into
the brakes. . . . Still, come to squint at the offense, Ben can't
overlook it. He's bound to stand by your dismissal of this
foreman."</p>
<p>"You don't know my brother very well yet," returned Hettie,
shaking her head. "If he had <i>seen</i> Dillon insult me he'd
have horsewhipped him. But Ben scouts my statements. He's tired
of hearing about these lovelorn cowboys who annoy me. He thinks
I'm--well, a little too sensitive. Once he said, 'If I was that
cowboy I'd throw you on a horse and ride off with you.' And
another time when I went to him in distress he said: 'Of course
he tried to kiss you. Why shouldn't he? You were made to be loved
and kissed.' . . . Sometimes I believe Ben is only in fun. He
doesn't mean that as it sounds. But he hasn't so much patience
with me as he used to have. I declare I don't know how he will
take this Dillon affair."</p>
<p>"I'll tell you, lass, now that you've expounded the
situation," replied the judge. "He'll not uphold you. Dillon will
get to him first and soften his offense, and Ben will keep him
on."</p>
<p>"That would be dreadful," said Hettie. "I'll actually be
afraid of Dillon."</p>
<p>"Well, the only solution to your problem, Hettie Ide, is to
fall in love with some fine Arizona lad," declared Judge
Franklidge, with both kindly conviction and teasing good
humor.</p>
<p>"Indeed!" returned Hettie, trying in vain to look haughty.
Then she thought it might be just as well to drop a hint to these
new friends. "I'd take your advice, Judge Franklidge--if it
wasn't for an insurmountable obstacle. . . . I can't fall in love
with a fine Arizona lad, because I'm already in love with a
fine--<i>Nevada</i> lad!"</p>
<p>As the beloved name sounded off her lips Hettie felt the swift
blood rise to tighten and heat her face.</p>
<p>The judge laughed heartily, but Alice, intuitively grasping
the import beneath Hettie's rather flippant speech, crossed over
to Hettie and put an arm around her.</p>
<p>"Dad is as bad as Ben, dear. Come, it's late. Let's go to
bed," she said.</p>
<p>"Well, Hettie," added the judge, in the same mirthful vein,
"if I were forty years younger I'd contest this mysterious
Nevadian's right. Where is the confounded lucky jackass?"</p>
<p>Hettie looked back from the doorway, through which Alice was
leading her.</p>
<p>"I do not know," she replied, sadly.</p>
<p>When the door closed she heard the judge burst out: "Did you
hear that, Van? It explains a lot. . . . Well, doggone me for a
thick-headed fool! And I'll gamble Ben Ide is the same."</p>
<p>At breakfast next morning Judge Franklidge seemed to have
undergone a subtle change. His interest in Hettie had increased,
but he dispensed with the mischievous bantering. Hettie felt that
in his estimation she had grown into a woman overnight, and that
she had found a friend in him.</p>
<p>"Hettie, I'm going to be sort of a dad to you," he said, at
parting. "I'm ashamed of the way Arizona has treated you and Ben.
But listen, lass. Have faith in us and this grand country. Have
patience with your brother. Try to persuade him not to spend more
money just now. We may have a year or two, or more, of hard
times. But take the word of an old cattleman who has been through
more than one rustler war. We will come out of it. These outlaws
destroy themselves, I've a hunch some hard-shootin' gunman will
come along and do for the ringleaders. It's happened here before.
It happened lately in New Mexico. So do not lose your nerve and
come to hate this beautiful country. We want you Ides to love it.
We need such fine people. We are pioneers, Hettie. I've lost a
million on cattle. But it'll come back. And so will your losses.
Likewise your happiness."</p>
<p>"Judge Franklidge," answered Hettie, smiling through her
tears, "despite my weakness for <i>Nevada--</i>I reckon I'm
Arizona's for life."</p>
<p>"Whoopee! That's the game lass! . . . Come to see us often,
Hettie. <i>Adios</i>."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the Franklidge stable hands drove Hettie into town, so
that she had time for thinking how best to approach Ben. It had
not occurred to her that Ben might get a warped version of the
affair from Dillon. She felt grateful to Judge Franklidge for his
kindly counsel and advice. Indeed, she had felt, too, with a
woman's keenness, something in regard to the judge's attitude
toward Dillon--something he did not confide. Yet she sensed his
friendship. He would very likely take her side, if the issue came
to an argument. She decided to wait and see if Dillon had
approached Ben.</p>
<p>Hettie, upon arriving in town, went about buying the supplies
usually ordered twice a month. She and her mother had preferred
to keep house in their own little cabin, a proceeding that Ina
and Ben had opposed. But Mrs. Ide vowed she would never be a
mother-in-law to anybody.</p>
<p>After she had finished her ordering, Hettie passed on down
street, presently to encounter Ben. He did not look in a very
good humor. There was a dark shade on his face which Hettie had
learned to regret, long ago back at Tule Lake Ranch. Her heart
sank a little, despite her fortitude. What if she had offended
Ben?</p>
<p>"Ina is at the dressmaker's," he said, after greeting her.
"Reckon it's a good time for you to go to the bank with me."</p>
<p>"Bank. What for?" she queried, as she yielded to his hand and
turned back up the street.</p>
<p>"I'm having a certified check made out for your interest in
the ranch."</p>
<p>"Ben!" she cried, in amazed reproach.</p>
<p>"Yes, Ben," he returned, a little testily. "Hettie, I can't
have you doing things without my knowledge. Besides, to be honest
with you, I don't want to see you lose that money. And I'm pretty
certain I'll lose all I put in cattle."</p>
<p>"But, Ben, it was an investment. I played to win or lose with
you," she protested.</p>
<p>"I know, dear, an' you sure are a thoroughbred. But this was a
crazy deal of mine. I don't regret it," he added, hastily. "But I
can't feel right to have you in with me. Maybe some day, when
these bad times are over."</p>
<p>"Ben, something has happened since I saw you," said Hettie,
quickly.</p>
<p>"Reckon it has," returned Ben, dropping his head so she could
not meet his eyes. "California Red is gone!"</p>
<p>"Gone? Oh no, Ben!" she cried, poignantly.</p>
<p>He nodded disconsolately. She saw his lips quiver.</p>
<p>"Stolen?"</p>
<p>"We don't know. He disappeared from the pasture. Raidy swears
Red was stolen, that he couldn't jump the fence. I know he could
jump over the moon if he took a notion. Dillon agrees with me
that Red just got away."</p>
<p>"But you don't <i>know?"</i> queried Hettie, sharply.</p>
<p>"That's the rub, Hettie. We don't. And there isn't a man in my
outfit who could track Red. Sure disgusted me. I tried to track
him myself. Had to give up. . . . Reckon there never was but one
horse hunter who <i>could</i> have done it."</p>
<p>"Ben, you'll get Red back," replied Hettie, earnestly, and
forthwith she launched into an eloquent speech, drawing upon the
judge's advice and optimism, and adding considerable of her own
hopeful and persistent opinions as to their ultimate success and
happiness in the future.</p>
<p>"You're game, Hettie," he returned, squeezing her arm. "With
you and Ina and the kid I can an' will beat this rotten deal.
Reckon it'll help some if you consent to withdraw from it."</p>
<p>"I'll consent to anything that will relieve or help you."</p>
<p>They reached the bank, where presently Hettie received a
certified check for her share in the transaction. She immediately
deposited it to her account.</p>
<p>"For the time being I'll leave it there," she said.</p>
<p>"Yes, do. I might have to borrow from you," he laughed, then
with serious brow he drew her to a seat and said in a low voice,
"Dillon just told me you'd discharged him."</p>
<p>"Yes?" queried Hettie, lifting her chin, while the tingle and
heat of battle ran along her nerves.</p>
<p>"Hettie, I had to countermand your order," he went on,
gravely. "Now we won't argue about it. Dillon is the best man
available. I can't get along without him. He knows it, too. I had
some trouble conciliatin' him."</p>
<p>"Oh, indeed!" retorted Hettie, biting her lips. "May I ask
what Mr. Dillon told you."</p>
<p>"Not much. He was sore, but he laughed, at that. Said he loved
you an' had been coaxin' you to look upon him favorably. Then
last night--at the dance--he asked you to marry him. Said you
weren't very encouragin'. Then he tried to kiss you, an' you made
a fuss an' took it upon yourself to fire him."</p>
<p>"If you believe him, Ben, why, there's no need in my bothering
you with my side of the story," rejoined Hettie, finding her
self-control.</p>
<p>"Reckon there's no call to think Dillon's a liar," went on
Ben. "The truth is, Hettie, you're a little of a man-hater. Oh, I
know--I remember, an' I sure don't blame you for bein'
true--to--to <i>him. . . .</i> But you're hard on all these poor
devils who fall in love with you. That's the way I see it."</p>
<p>"Ben Ide, I am not a man-hater," protested Hettie.</p>
<p>"We won't argue the question," said Ben, wearily. "You an' Ina
always beat me. But please don't misunderstand. I don't want you
to marry Dillon. He seems a fine fellow who'll make a big man in
Arizona some day. Just the same, I'd want to know him better
before I'd let him have you."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Ben. I can forgive you now," murmured Hettie.</p>
<p>"I'd like to ask you somethin'," went on Ben, with both
concern and mirth in his look. "Did you strike Dillon last
night--when he tried to kiss you?"</p>
<p>"Strike him? No, I certainly did not," declared Hettie,
vehemently. "I wouldn't soil my hands on--But why do you ask
that?"</p>
<p>"Well, he had a beautiful black eye," replied Ben,
ponderingly. "He told me he had stumbled in the dark--in his
room--an' hit a chair. Sure it could have happened. But it looked
to me like a beautiful black eye that had come from a good swing
an' a hard fist. I've been wonderin' if he lied to me."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm wondering who gave him just what he deserved. But,
Ben, if you have such faith in this Dillon, why did you wonder at
all?"</p>
<p>"I happened to run into Dillon talkin' to Stewart, who is Tom
Day's foreman," replied Ben. "I heard Dillon say somethin' about
bumpin' into a chair. Then Stewart, who'd been drinkin', gave
Dillon the horse laugh. Struck me funny, that's all."</p>
<p>"Brother dear, I hope you won't be struck by anything
funnier," said Hettie, as she arose. "I've got more shopping to
do, and time flies. You wished me to meet you at twelve?"</p>
<p>"You bet; <i>pronto,</i> too," he returned. "It's a long drive
home, you know. I've got a lot of things to see to. But reckon
I'll make it."</p>
<p>"How about Marvie?"</p>
<p>"He'll be there. Marvie hunted me up an' asked for money. I'd
just given him some, before we left. The kid was intoxicated, all
right."</p>
<p>"Ben! You don't mean he was drunk?" burst out Hettie, in
horror.</p>
<p>"No. I was goin' to tell you he was intoxicated over some
girl. Wanted to buy her candy an' presents. But, by George! I
forgot I promised not to give him away. Don't you dare give
<i>me</i> away. . . . So long, till twelve. I'll pick you up at
Brydon's store."</p>
<p>"What a fright you gave me!" complained Hettie. "You should
choose your words more carefully. As to Marvie--I think he's in
love. I saw the girl. Tell you more later."</p>
<p>Hettie's thoughts reverted to Marvie and lingered dreamily and
anxiously around him until she reached the dry-goods store, where
she forgot everything except the important shopping at hand.</p>
<p>It lacked five minutes to twelve when she labored to the front
of the store, burdened by bundles, and vastly satisfied with
herself that she had finished in time to meet Ben. He was
punctuality itself and appreciated the same in anyone. Hettie
deposited her bundles on a window seat beside the door, and
looked out for Ben. He had not yet arrived.</p>
<p>Suddenly a man, hatless and coatless, dashed by, yelling,
<i>"Keep off the street!"</i></p>
<p>"What's the matter with him?" asked Hettie, amused.</p>
<p>Several clerks came hurriedly to peep out.</p>
<p>"Looks like another fight," said one of them, excitedly.</p>
<p>Shouting and trampling of feet followed. Across the street
pedestrians hurriedly ran into the first open doorway they
happened upon. The noise ceased. Then a man entered the door
where Hettie stood transfixed and thrilling.</p>
<p>"Hello, Matt! What's doin'?" queried the clerk.</p>
<p>"Darned if I know," replied the man. "I seen people run off
the street, so I ducked in here. Just before I heard Jim Lacy was
in town."</p>
<p>"Who?" shouted his questioner.</p>
<p>"Jim Lacy. Don't know how true it is. But somebody's in town,
you can gamble on that."</p>
<p>Faces appeared at all doors and windows. Some peeped down the
street, then jerked back. How ridiculous it seemed to Hettie! Yet
there she stood likewise, her heart throbbing, her whole being in
a state of suspense.</p>
<p>A shot pealed out, deep and ringing. Then <i>bang!</i> Another
followed, almost like an echo. Silence ensued, palpitating,
stifling to Hettie. What had happened? A fight! Guns! A single
shout came from far down the street.</p>
<p>The man beside Hettie peeped out.</p>
<p>"By Gawd!" he ejaculated, in husky accents.</p>
<p>The clerk, frightened as he was, also had to look. He jerked
in his head, with pale face and eyes staring, and he began to
jabber.</p>
<p>Hettie obeyed an irresistible instinct. She peeped out. The
street appeared empty. No, there was a man lying face down, not
fifty feet from the door. His arms were outstretched.</p>
<p>"It's Jim Lacy. I never saw him, but I know them who has,"
said the man beside Hettie.</p>
<p>"Oh--how dreadful! . . . the dead man--there in the road--Jim
Lacy?" whispered Hettie, beginning to shake and grow sick.</p>
<p>"No. Jim Lacy is the one comin' up the street. . . . See his
gun. It's smokin'!"</p>
<p>Then Hettie, looking farther, espied a man in rider's garb,
gun in hand, stalking toward his victim. He passed him, with only
a downward glance. He sheathed the gun. He strode toward the
sidewalk.</p>
<p>His walk! His shape! A terrible piercing sensation attacked
Hettie. Had she been horrified out of her senses? Was she mad?
What flashed so swiftly in memory? But this man--this Jim Lacy!
He was coming. He would pass the door.</p>
<p>Hettie drew back with the last of failing strength. She
reeled. Her mind had halted. The quivering of her body ceased as
if paralysis had set in. Cold, numb, awful suspense held her
upright, waiting, as if for death itself.</p>
<p>The man in rider's garb passed the doorway, erect,
stone-faced, with eyes of lightning set ahead.</p>
<p>Nevada! Hettie's faculties leaped out of terror and
stupefaction to recognize him. Nevada! Jim Lacy? . . .
<i>Nevada!</i></p>
<p>She had a sense of sinking down. All went blank--then slipped
into black oblivion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c14" id="c14">FOURTEEN</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Hettie recovered consciousness before she had strength enough
to open her eyes. She was lying down, with some one supporting
her head. Cold water had been dashed in her face. She felt it
trickling down her neck.</p>
<p>"It's Miss Ide," said some one. "She fainted. . . . Fell right
down!"</p>
<p>"No wonder!" returned another speaker, evidently a woman. "I'm
sort of sickish an' weak myself. Hadn't you better call a
doctor?"</p>
<p>Whereupon Hettie opened her eyes, to whisper weakly, "I'll
be--all right."</p>
<p>She lay on the window seat, with her head supported by the
young clerk. Several persons, one a woman, stood around
sympathetically.</p>
<p>"There! She's come to."</p>
<p>A bewildering complexity and whirling of thought suddenly left
Hettie with her mind clear.</p>
<p>"Is my brother here?" she asked, trying to sit up. With the
aid of the young man she managed it, and slipped her feet to the
floor.</p>
<p>"No," was the reply.</p>
<p>"First time--in my life--I ever fainted," said Hettie.</p>
<p>"Better set still a little, miss. You're awful white yet,"
said the woman kindly. "Let me help you put on your hat. It was
here on the floor. You must have had a tumble."</p>
<p>The clerk smiled and got up. "No. She just sank. Like a limp
sack. So she couldn't have hurt herself."</p>
<p>"Indeed, I'm not hurt," returned Hettie. "You're all very
kind. . . . It was silly of me to--to keel over like that."</p>
<p>While she talked there seemed to be an awful question
hammering at her consciousness. When Ben and, Marvie entered, at
that moment, she understood what the question was. Neither of
them knew what she knew. Her relief was so great that it overcame
her, and when she tried to rise she only sank back again.</p>
<p>"Why, Hettie!" cried Ben, in sharp concern, as he sat down to
grasp her. Then Marvie knelt on the seat at her other side.
Hettie smiled wanly at them and closed her eyes. She felt dizzy,
and then feared to look at them.</p>
<p>"It's nothin' serious, Mr. Ide," spoke up the clerk, hastily.
"She just fainted. It was the shootin'. She peeped out--an' then
when I seen her again, there she lay on the floor."</p>
<p>"Whew, Hettie! You gave me a scare," said Ben, as he hugged
her and shook her a little. "But you're all right. It was only
you went flooy over a street duel. Why, I'm surprised at you.
Anyone would think you'd never heard a gun back in California. .
. . Come, brace up, Hettie."</p>
<p>"Take me home," replied Hettie, opening her eyes again. "I--I
want to get out of this town."</p>
<p>"Wal, I should smile! Me, too," joined in Marvie, squeezing
her hand. Hettie had never seen the lad look quite as he did
then. The freckles stood out on his pale wet face. His eyes held
a bright stare. She did not dare ask him if he had seen the
participants of the street duel. She feared he had.</p>
<p>"Marvie, you fetch these bundles," requested Ben, as he lifted
Hettie to her feet. He had to support her, or she could not have
walked just yet. He swore under his breath, then, scornfully,
"This Arizona's a nice place for women! . . . Never mind, honey;
maybe we'll get over it. I'm thankin' my stars Ina didn't
see."</p>
<p>Ben helped her into the back seat of the buckboard. "There,
you're all right. . . . Marvie, put the bundles under the seats.
Then get in beside Hettie an' hang on to her. I've got some
drivin' to do. Soon as I pick up Ina, I'll sure leave this town
in a cloud of dust."</p>
<p>Hettie did not look to right or left, yet she saw and heard
the excited people passing, talking down the street. Ben drove
rapidly. Soon the center of town lay behind. The streets were
quiet. Hettie lost the cold dread of seeing a lithe stone-faced
man in rider's garb. Ben halted the horses before a house set
well back in a green yard, and as he leaped to the ground Ina
appeared.</p>
<p>"Hello, you-all!" she called, merrily. "See, Ben, I'm right on
the dot. Now, sir." As she reached the buck-board she suddenly
halted aghast. "Why, Hettie! . . . You look terrible. Are you
ill? Oh, what has happened?"</p>
<p>"Ina, I'm a poor pioneer," said Hettie, with rueful smile.</p>
<p>"Nothin' to upset you, wife," replied Ben. "Hettie had a
scare. There was a shootin' fray downtown, an' she fainted. Climb
up, an' we'll be off <i>pronto.</i> These ponies are sure rarin'
to go."</p>
<p>As soon as Ina had climbed up she turned solicitously to
Hettie and reached for her hand. "You poor dear! I never saw you
look like this. Fainted! That's strange. You never fainted in
your life."</p>
<p>"I did this time, all right," returned Hettie.</p>
<p>"Why? What happened? Did you see a fight?" queried Ina,
excitedly.</p>
<p>"No. I didn't see--the fight," replied Hettie, shutting her
eyes tight. "But I heard it. . . . Then I peeped out--to see a--a
dead man lying in the street."</p>
<p>"How dreadful! Oh, this wild Arizona! It's worse than Forlorn
River when we were girls."</p>
<p>"Worse?" laughed Ben, grimly. "Say, Ina, California in our day
could never hold a candle to Arizona."</p>
<p>"Did you see this fight?"</p>
<p>"No. I missed it."</p>
<p>"Did you, Marvie? Oh, I hope you didn't."</p>
<p>"All I saw of it was the dead man. I walked by him. He had a
bloody hole in the top--"</p>
<p>"Shut up, you infant gun-slinger," interrupted Ben.</p>
<p>"Did you know the fighters, Ben?" went on Ina, curiously.</p>
<p>"No. Some one told me Jim Lacy had come to town, lookin' for
trouble. He gave a rustler named Hardy Rue choice of leavin' town
or throwin' a gun. Rue chose to stick, an' it cost him his life.
Had no chance on earth, some one said. They met in the street.
Even break, of course, as these Arizonians call a fair fight. But
Rue was fallin' when his gun went off."</p>
<p>"Terrible," said his wife, shuddering. "But a rustler cannot
be a very great loss to the community."</p>
<p>"Ina, I sure hope Mr. Jim Lacy sticks around for a while,"
replied Ben, laconically. "Tom Day told me Hardy Rue might be the
leader of the rustlers who've been pinchin' me so hard. But
Dillon scouted the idea."</p>
<p>During this conversation Hettie was glad to have the support
of Marvie's arm and shoulder. She had not opened her eyes. But
her ears rang acutely with the words she heard.</p>
<p>"Ben, I reckon you an' sis might shut up, yourselves,"
declared Marvie, significantly, "or talk about somethin'
else."</p>
<p>"Sure, sonny," agreed Ben. "It's no pleasant subject."</p>
<p>The spirited team drew the light buckboard at a rapid pace
over the smooth, hard road. The breeze stirred by this pace was
cool and pleasant to Hettie's throbbing brow. After a long rest,
she opened her eyes and sat up again. Already the dark line of
cedars was in sight, and beyond them the uneven timbered ridges
that ran up to the black frowning Mogollons. How vast and wild
that range! Hettie's heart seemed to come to life again. It had
been locked, clamped, frozen. What was it that had stricken her,
almost unto death? If she were only alone in her room, so that
she could face the catastrophe, so that she could give way to her
agony! But many miles and hours lay between her and seclusion.
She essayed to make conversation with Marvie.</p>
<p>"Your girl is very pretty, Marvie," she said, close to his
ear.</p>
<p>Marvie actually blushed and squirmed in his seat, and gripped
Hettie's arm so hard under the robe that it hurt.</p>
<p>"You had met her before last night," whispered Hettie.</p>
<p>"Ahuh!" he replied.</p>
<p>"Marvie, you are no longer a boy. You're a young man with
prospects. And she--forgive me--she belongs to that notorious
Hatt family. I don't blame you for--for admiring her; she's like
a wild rose. But say it's not serious."</p>
<p>"I wish I could," whispered Marvie, swallowing hard.</p>
<p>"Marvie! Tell me."</p>
<p>"Not now. I can't, Hettie," he said, huskily. "But I will when
we get home."</p>
<p>"I'm on your side, Marvie," concluded Hettie, pressing his
arm.</p>
<p>For a while she was able to concentrate her thoughts upon this
lad and the girl, Rose Hatt, and the unhappiness that might
accrue for both. Marvie was under probation. Yet it would not be
long until he was of age and his own master. It seemed altogether
unlikely that he would ever return to California. The rich acres
of Hart Blaine had no hold upon Marvie.</p>
<p>Soon Hettie's will succumbed to the tremendous pressure of
recurring thoughts and emotion. She gave up. She had to let
herself go. Then while her gaze strained out over the yellow and
green prairieland, and the rolling ridges with their slopes of
sage, and the miles of white grass where herds of cattle grazed,
and on and on, and ever upward to the purple ranges lost in the
rosy pearly clouds of hot afternoon, while she saw these
beautiful characteristics of Arizona, she was confronting herself
with the staggering truth.</p>
<p>She had seen Nevada. She could not torture herself with a
thought of doubt--that she might have been mistaken. Sight and
heart and mind, her whole being had recognized him in one
terrible instant. He was in Winthrop. He was Jim Lacy. Jim Lacy,
whom range rumor had long made mysterious, famous, ruthless. Jim
Lacy was Nevada. Back in those Forlorn River days, when she and
Ben and Ina and Marvie had loved him as Nevada, even then he had
been Jim Lacy. Why was she stunned? Ever since Nevada had killed
Setter and ridden away never to be heard of again Hettie had
realized he had borne a name he could not endure for her or Ben
to know. That was not so astounding. Nevada might have been any
one of the noted desperadoes of the West. The overwhelming thing
was that Nevada was here in Arizona, alive, virile, stone-faced
as she had seen him but once, here in Winthrop, close to the home
she and Ben had chosen almost solely in the hope that they might
find him some day.</p>
<p>What if she had seen him? A sickening helpless impotence
assailed her. All the longing of years wasted! All the hope and
prayer and faith wasted! Vain oblations. Nevada had been false to
her, false to the best she had helped to raise in him, false to
the blessed conviction she had always entertained--that whoever
he was and whatever he had done, out of love for her and
assurance of her faith, he would go on to disappear from the evil
roads of the West and turn to an honest life. Hettie would have
gambled her soul on that. And now the soul she would have staked
grew sick with horror and revulsion. Nevada was a consort of
rustlers, a bloodthirsty killer, a terrible engine of
destruction.</p>
<p>But perhaps he had only killed another man! A bad man--a
thief--even as Less Setter had been! The insidious small voice
beat at the gate of her consciousness of faithlessness. And she
listened, she clutched at it with the hope of a drowning woman,
she hugged it to that soul which seemed to be freezing. So with
unseeing eyes on the rolling, darkening desert, she admitted more
and keener anguish into this strife of love and faith. How could
she be faithless in hope, in trust? Had she not sworn, with her
lips close to his, that she would die before she ever failed him?
What if he had used his deadly gun again? He had killed, as
before, perhaps more than once in his life, a worthless wicked
man, whose death must serve some good purpose. Nevada had once
saved Ben and Ina and her, all of them, from grief and misery.
Who could tell what the killing of Hardy Rue might be to some
one? No! Nevada had not sunk to the companionship of evil men and
women, to drinking, gambling, rustling, to the vile dregs of this
wild West.</p>
<p>Over and over again this stream of consciousness eddied
through Hettie's mind, like conflicting tides, now rushing, again
receding, now full and devastating.</p>
<p>Through the waning afternoon, sunset, twilight, dusk, on into
the night Hettie acquired deeper insight into the gulf which
yawned beneath her.</p>
<p>The swift horses had swung into the home stretch, over the
short-cut road that had been one of Ben's achievements. How the
night wind moaned in the lofty pines! It seemed the moan of the
world. The fragrance of sage filled the air. Down through the
pale aisles of the forest moved shadows, unreal, grotesque,
things as strange as shadows of the mind.</p>
<p>Marvie now leaned against Hettie's shoulder, sound asleep. Ina
had not spoken for hours. Ben, tireless and silent, kept the
horses at a steady clip-clop, clip-clop. He always took pride in
driving to town in eight hours and home in nine. A good road, a
stanch fast team, a light vehicle, had conquered the one drawback
to Ben's wilderness ranch.</p>
<p>When at last they arrived Hettie crept exhausted to her room,
and falling upon her bed, she lay quiet, wanting to rest and
think before she undressed. But she fell asleep.</p>
<p>When she awakened the sun was shining gold in at her window,
and the fresh sweet cool fragrance of the forest blew over her.
Instead of being beautiful they seemed dreadful. She dreaded
wakefulness, the daylight, the many duties to be met, the
imperative need of action, the facing of her family and of life.
But she could not keep them back. And with the truth there surged
over her the catastrophe that had fallen.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's not a catastrophe," she whispered to the faithful,
waiting silence of her room.</p>
<p>Hettie sensed then that her greatest trial was yet to come,
and a faint intimation of what it might be appalled her. It
roused her to battle. Dragging her aching body off the bed, she
undressed, and bathed her hot face, and brushed out her tangled
hair, and put on her outdoor clothes.</p>
<p>Then she slipped out without awakening her mother in the
adjoining room. What was it that she must do? Find him, save him,
or perish! All that she faced in the golden morning light seemed
to mingle in one subtle whisper. There was no deceit, no
blindness, no vacillation in the nature that spoke to her.</p>
<p>Only the birds and the wild game, and the calves in the
pasture, the roosters in the barnyard, the burros out on the
range shared with Hettie those perfect uplifting, clarifying
moments of the sunrise.</p>
<p>Golden gleams of light crossed the brown boles of the stately
pines; low down through the foliage shone patches of pink sky; to
the north and west opened the vast slant down to the desert,
illimitable and magnificent in the rosy, shadowy soft dawn. Deer
and antelope grazed with the cows in the pasture. Squirrels
barked from the trees, hawks sent down their shrill piercing
cries, wild turkeys gobbled from over the ridge. Joy of life,
radiance of creation, peace and solitude, wholesomeness and
sweetness of nature, the exquisite beauty of woodland and
wasteland at the break of day, and a marvelous, inscrutable,
divine will pervaded that wilderness scene.</p>
<p>Hettie absorbed it. She lifted up her head to the one black
dome of the Mogollons. The misery of the night faded away like a
nightmare. She had been a coward. She had failed to be grateful
for the very thing that had been the beginning and end of her
prayers. Could she be so slight and shallow a woman as to succumb
to heartbreak? A terrible ordeal faced her, the outcome of which
she could not divine. She could only endure and fight whatever
fate had in store.</p>
<p>"Oh, if I can cling to this blessed strength!" she cried. "To
hold it fast when I'm distracted! To have it in hours of
gloom!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That day Hettie did not cross the picturesque log bridge that
spanned the brook between her cabin and the beautiful rambling
residence of her brother. She plunged into her work, which
consisted of the housekeeping she shared with her mother, her
dressmaking and other personal tasks, and all the bookkeeping
necessary to the running of a large expensive ranch.</p>
<p>She did not see Ben all day. Late in the afternoon, when she
went out to walk a little in the open air, she espied Marvie
sitting on the porch, a most abject-looking lad.</p>
<p>"Hello, Marv, old pard! Come and walk with me," she said,
brightly.</p>
<p>"Aw, I want to die!" replied Marvie.</p>
<p>"Goodness gracious! Well, don't do that on my porch. It'd be a
perpetual reminder of you."</p>
<p>She dragged him to his feet and locking an arm with his led
him off into the woods, until they were out of sight of anyone at
the house. Then Hettie bade him sit with her under an old pine
where the fragrant brown needle mat looked so inviting.</p>
<p>"Now, Marv, I'm through teasing," she said, with a gravity
that suited his mood. "What's the trouble?"</p>
<p>"I had a run-in with Ben," replied the lad. "First one we ever
had."</p>
<p>"You did? Well, I've had a thousand. When Ben gets sulky and
cross a good run-in clears him up, as a thunderstorm does a
sultry day. Where did Ben go to-day?"</p>
<p>"He finally rode off to a deserted homestead over here, five
miles or so. Some one found tracks of California Red, and that
news upset Ben. Then he waited round hours for Dillon, who didn't
come. Raidy, who's on the outs with Dillon, said some things that
made Ben sorer. You know Raidy. Well, doggone it, Ben pretty soon
pitched into me."</p>
<p>"What for?" queried Hettie, practically.</p>
<p>"Nothin'. Not a darned thing. 'Cept I moped along at a job he
gave me. Fixin' fence. If there's any job I hate it's that. He
swore at me. Then I told him to go to the devil--I'd quit and go
home."</p>
<p>"What did Ben say?" asked Hettie.</p>
<p>"He said, 'Go ahead, you bull-headed, lop-eared little
jackass.' . . . So I rode off home. And I reckon I'll quit. I'm
goin' to be a rustler."</p>
<p>"All right. You want to become a rustler," returned Hettie,
accepting the statement. "What for?"</p>
<p>Marvie did not reply for a long while, during which his head
sank lower.</p>
<p>"Hettie, I'm turrible--in love," he said at last, with an
effort.</p>
<p>"Rose Hatt?"</p>
<p>"Yes. It couldn't be nobody else."</p>
<p>"Does Rose love you?" asked Hettie, softly, her hand going to
Marvie's.</p>
<p>"I thought she did, at first," replied the boy, writhing. "She
let me kiss her--kissed me back. But last night, when I asked her
to meet me again, she said no. I got mad. But she stuck to it.
When I accused her of flirtin', and me dead in earnest, she said:
'Marvie, I've a bad name. I belong to the Hatts. You've a lovely
sister' (she'd seen <i>you)</i> 'and a proud family. I'm only a
backwoods girl. It won't do. I'll not see you no more.' She ran
away from me then an' I couldn't find her. She'd hidden or left
the dance. In the mornin' I tried again. No luck."</p>
<p>"Marvie, I admire Rose for that," said Hettie, earnestly. "I
think she's a square girl, even if she is a Hatt."</p>
<p>"Now, Hettie, don't you go talkin' like dad or mother," burst
out Marvie, warningly.</p>
<p>"Oh, Marvie, I won't," declared Hettie, ashamed of the fact
that she had been about to do so. By Marvie's warning she
estimated his regard for her.</p>
<p>"I don't care a damn about myself--even when I do love her
turrible," went on Marvie, passionately. "But what's to become of
Rose?"</p>
<p>In the sincerity and inevitableness of youth he had hit upon
the thing that mattered most.</p>
<p>"I understand, Marvie," said Hettie, gravely. "You make me
ashamed. Rose is not to blame for her family, for her
surroundings, for--anything."</p>
<p>"Now you're talkin' like Hettie Ide," returned Marvie,
fervently. "And I'm givin' you a hunch. If Rose really loves me
I'll stick to her. In spite of dad or Ben or anyone!"</p>
<p>Hettie dropped her head. Here was a problem. What should she
say? Marvie's confidence in her suddenly meant more than ever
before. He needed something from her.</p>
<p>"What knocks me flat is--I'm afraid she doesn't love me," went
on the lad. "I'm goin' to find out, though, if I have to ride
right under Cedar Hatt's nose. . . . Last night I believed she
didn't. This mornin' I thought she did. If not--if she was only a
little hussy--why'd she say she had a bad name and wouldn't meet
me no more?"</p>
<p>Hettie had no quick reply to his passionate query. Owing to
her own stress of emotion during the last twenty-four hours, she
was far from being her old logical self. But she was fighting a
conviction that Rose Hatt had shown nobility and sacrifice in her
attitude toward Marvie's advances. If those attributes did not
spring from love, Hettie did not know what to call it.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Hettie," begged Marvie, with soul-searching eyes
that hurt her, "don't you think Rose cared really? Wasn't that
good in her--givin' me up? Wasn't it because she--she liked me
too well to go on with what she thought might disgrace me an' you
an' Ben?"</p>
<p>"Marv, I can't be sure, but I think so."</p>
<p>"Thanks--Hettie," choked the lad, sitting up straight and
facing ahead. A light crossed his somber youthful face. "You hit
me right here." And he put his hand to his breast. "Sure I
couldn't tell nobody else but you. It's helped a lot."</p>
<p>"Marvie, how in the world did all this come about?" asked
Hettie, in wondering sympathy.</p>
<p>"Like a story, Hettie. I met Rose over a month ago. Went
huntin' on a Sunday. Rode a long way, then walked. I got after
some turkeys. They were awful wild. I followed them a long ways,
down into a big grassy canyon where a stream ran. Most beautiful
place. Deer, elk, beaver all along. But I wanted one of them big
old gobblers. So I kept on. And I run plump into a girl. She was
cryin'. I spoke to her--sat down with her. After a while she
began to talk. First she was sore an' hot at her brother, Cedar
Hatt, who beat her. Showed me black-and-blue marks on her bare
legs. I said somebody like Jim Lacy ought to come along and kill
him. Funny, wasn't it--me sayin' that? Well, we got real
friendly. She said she'd meet me again, but farther away. That
place was too near home. So she told me where a trail ran and how
I could find it. I never told her who I was that time. Forgot.
Anyway, I kept the day she set, and sure enough she came. . . .
It was different that day. I reckon I fell in love then--not the
first day. And she--but never mind. . . . I met her three times
more. And last time, night before last at the dance. That's
all."</p>
<p>"It's quite enough, isn't it, Marvie?" said Hettie.</p>
<p>"It sure is. I forgot to tell you. At the dance, when she said
first she wouldn't meet me no more, I said I was goin' to our
place Wednesday at the same time as before. I'm goin', too."</p>
<p>"Marv, if what I know of girls holds true--if she really
cares--she'll come. Rose is too young to stick to a hard decision
like that, if her heart's involved."</p>
<p>"Hettie, you're a comfort," cried Marvie, gratefully, almost
hugging her. "I'll hope she'll come. I'll believe it. Maybe
that'll let me eat and sleep."</p>
<p>"You'll tell me everything?" asked Hettie, earnestly.</p>
<p>"You bet I will. Now I'll go and crawl to Ben."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Several days passed. Hettie took to horseback-riding again,
venturing perhaps farther away from the ranch than Ben would have
allowed, had he known. But Hettie seemed driven. On Wednesday she
rode with Marvie for five miles back into the forest toward the
brakes, and that was the greatest ride she ever enjoyed. Ridge
and canyon, the aspen thickets, the wonderful swales where the
turkeys and elk lived, the beaver dams and bee trees, the first
coloring of vines and sumach in the open spots, the deep dark
thickets where the horses scented bear and reared to turn back,
the roar of water over boulders and the wind through the pine
tops--these things enchanted Hettie and won her more than ever to
the wilderness of Arizona.</p>
<p>On the last stretch back home, where the trail was fairly
level and open, she urged her horse to his best speed. That race
satisfied, for the time being, a restlessness and need of
violence. Her blood danced hot; wind and sun burned her cheeks;
the tang of the woods acted like wine. Thus she rode down into
the clearing and on to the barn and corrals. And she ran
pell-mell into Ben, Raidy, Dillon, and Tom Day, scattering them
like quail.</p>
<p>"Hey there, you Indian!" yelled Ben, and he climbed a corral
fence, the better to tease her.</p>
<p>Hettie reined her mount and, wheeling him, trotted back, and
slid from the saddle.</p>
<p>"He's a--fine horse, Ben," she declared, patting the wet
neck.</p>
<p>"Wal, he suits you, lass," said Tom Day, admiringly, as he
took her in from boots to sombrero.</p>
<p>"Miss Hettie, strikes me this hyar Arizonie has got into your
blood," added old Raidy, shaking his head dubiously. "Reckon I
don't like it. Day says it ain't safe for you to ride out alone.
So does Dillon."</p>
<p>"What do <i>you</i> say, Ben?" queried Hettie, archly.</p>
<p>"Not a darn thing. I quit long ago tryin' to run you,"
returned Ben.</p>
<p>Dillon leaned against the corral, in the background, without
entering into the conversation. The discoloration round his eye
had not wholly disappeared.</p>
<p>"Miss, can't you be happy ridin' on the ranch, without headin'
off into the woods?" asked Raidy.</p>
<p>"Do you think I'd ride inside a fence? Not much."</p>
<p>"Wal, Hettie Ide, I sure know what you need," declared Tom
Day.</p>
<p>"To be spanked, I suppose," laughed Hettie. "But seriously,
what's the danger?"</p>
<p>"Wal, lass, mebbe there ain't any real danger," replied Day,
thoughtfully. "But we're sort of locoed these days. Reckon it's
far-fetched to think hoss-thieves an' rustlers might take a
notion to steal you."</p>
<p>"Kidnap me for ransom?" queried Hettie, incredulously.</p>
<p>"Wal, yes, an' for other reasons, too," rejoined the old
cattleman, significantly. "You don't 'pear to know it, but you're
a mighty handsome girl."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Uncle Tom. That's a fine compliment. But it's not
scaring me."</p>
<p>"Hettie, look here," interposed Ben, gravely, stepping to her
with a piece of paper in his hand. "Read this."</p>
<p>Hettie took the coarse dirty paper and read:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>Ben Ide<br>
   Sir.<br>
   Fire your foreman Dillon or dig a grave for him.</blockquote>
<blockquote style="text-align:right;">X.          </blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Without a word Hettie returned the slip to her brother.</p>
<p>"We found that nailed on the bunkhouse door," he said,
angrily. "It's a threat. Dillon recovered another bunch of my
cattle yesterday. Only a few head, but enough to make these
rustlers sore. To-day we found where they'd been camping in an
old cabin, on my own land. Of all the nerve! I've been reasonable
about this cattle-stealing. I expected it. But when these thieves
grab my best horse and camp right under my nose--it's time for me
to get sore."</p>
<p>"See, Miss Hettie," added Raidy. "That's why it ain't safe for
you to ride out so far."</p>
<p>"I'll be careful hereafter," replied Hettie, soberly, handing
her horse over to Raidy. "Mr. Day, won't you stay for
supper?"</p>
<p>"Sorry, lass, but I've got to be goin' home."</p>
<p>"Good-by then. Come soon again," said Hettie, turning away.
She was proceeding up the lane, revolving in mind that
threatening note Ben had showed her, when he caught up with her
and fell into her step.</p>
<p>"Hettie, on the square now--did you write this note and stick
it up on the bunkhouse?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Ben Ide! Are you crazy?" Hettie cried, incredulously. Then
she burst out laughing. "Of all things! . . . Brother, I fear the
loss of your cattle and California Red has caused you to lose
your head."</p>
<p>"Forgive me, Hettie," returned Ben, contritely. "I imagined
you might have done that, just to plague me. And honest, I wish
you had."</p>
<p>"Ben, why in the world can you wish such a thing as that?"</p>
<p>"Because if you had I wouldn't worry. I hoped you'd done it.
Reckon I am loco, as these riders say. But, Hettie, I don't like
this situation I'm in."</p>
<p>"Neither do I, Ben," retorted Hettie. "But nobody can tell you
anything."</p>
<p>"Aw now, Hettie, that's not nice of you," said Ben,
reproachfully. "I told Ina about your affair with
Dillon--<i>your</i> side of it, mind you. She pitched into me
like sixty. I can't stand havin' both of you against me."</p>
<p>"We're not against you, Ben," returned Hettie, earnestly.</p>
<p>"Yes, you are," he said, doggedly. "An' I'm getting sore at
everybody. I'm going against your advice and Ina's, even Tom
Day's. I've offered a reward of one thousand dollars for the
return of California Red. Posted notices along the trails. Tom
didn't like that. Said some one would bring the horse back, then
steal him again."</p>
<p>"What did Dillon say?" asked Hettie, curiously.</p>
<p>"He approved my offering the reward. You know Dillon said he
could get Red back. And he was away two days, after he returned
from Winthrop. I don't know where he went. He's worked with most
of these outfits along the Mogollons. He knows them all, anyway,
and no doubt some of them are clanny with the horse and cattle
thieves. That's the worst of this country. You really don't know
who is honest. Well, Dillon came back and said he couldn't find
out anything about Red. So I decided to offer a reward. And
Dillon himself took the notices out on the range."</p>
<p>"You'll get Red back," returned Hettie, hopefully.</p>
<p>"I've got another idea," he went on. "I want to send for
several well-known sheriffs and put them on the track of these
rustlers. Pat Garrett, of New Mexico. If I could get him, and a
couple from Phoenix, and hire a gang of hard-shooting cowboys,
I'll bet they'd clean out the rustlers. But Tom Day yelled murder
at the very idea. And Dillon, he hit the roof. Swore they'd burn
me out instead of just rustling a few cattle. Few? By George! I'd
like to know what Dillon would call a lot of cattle."</p>
<p>"Ben, you should listen to Tom Day, at least," replied Hettie.
"He knows the country."</p>
<p>"I'm listening, Hettie. But I want some action," he retorted.
"If I don't get Red back inside of ten days there'll be hell to
pay by somebody."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Marvie did not return to the ranch till late. Hettie sat up
waiting for him, trying to read, but mostly gazing into the wood
fire with dreamy, sad eyes. She heard his swift step on the
porch, and a jingle of spurs, then a quick knock.</p>
<p>"Come in, Marvie," she called expectantly.</p>
<p>In he rushed, like the wind, but quietly, and he startled her
with his pale face crossed by black smudges, and his piercing,
radiant eyes. He carried a rifle and quirt and gloves in his
hands; and altogether he appeared a striking, thrilling figure.
Hettie knew before he spoke what had happened.</p>
<p>"She was there!" he whispered, dramatically.</p>
<p>"Marv, I knew that the instant you entered," said Hettie, with
a smile. There was a contagion in his spirit.</p>
<p>"Hettie, I'm sure the happiest an' miserablest man in the
world," he added.</p>
<p>"Sit down, Marvie, and tell me all about it."</p>
<p>"Not a great deal to tell, but what there is of it is tumble,"
he returned, coming to the seat beside her. Then in a low voice,
full of suppressed emotion, he went on: "Rose was there. She'd
been there for hours, waitin', cryin', fearin' I wouldn't come.
She said her heart broke. She'd found out she loved me. I was the
only one who'd ever cared for her--been good to her. She said she
could give me up--to save me disgrace--but she'd have to kill
herself. I swore I'd stick to her--marry her. I talked an'
talked. An' then I told her I'd fetch you down the trail next
Wednesday. She was tumble scared at that. But I told her you'd
help us. An' finally she agreed. She's to ride down a trail we
know, till we meet her. . . . That's all, Hettie. An' for God's
sake--"</p>
<p>Marvie broke off huskily, his voice failing.</p>
<p>Hettie impulsively kissed him. "Marvie, I think you're pretty
much of a man," she said. "I'll go. And I'll find some way to
solve your problem."</p>
<p>He mumbled something incoherent and rushed out of the room,
neglecting to close the door. Hettie watched him stalk away in
the moonlight, then shutting the door she drew her chair nearer
the fire and fell into grave and sympathetic pondering over
Marvie's love affair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c15" id="c15">FIFTEEN</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Hettie, early riser as she was, outdid herself on this
Wednesday morning, which was the day on which she had agreed to
ride down into the brakes with Marvie.</p>
<p>There were tasks to see to, some of which she performed before
her mother called her to breakfast. Hettie was still at the table
when whoops outside alarmed her. Then she recognized Marvie's
"Whoopee!"</p>
<p>"Gracious! Is the poor kid celebrating the arrival of this
day?" ejaculated Hettie, mirthfully.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she ran out on the porch, followed by her
mother.</p>
<p>"For the land's sake!" cried Mrs. Ide. "Has Marvie gone
daffy!"</p>
<p>They saw him running wildly bareheaded, up the walk toward
Ben's house. Once up on the ridge, Marvie espied Hettie, and
waving to her he yelled:</p>
<p>"Look down in the pasture!"</p>
<p>Hettie did so, at least toward the near pasture, but as her
view was most obscured by pine trees she did not see anything
unusual.</p>
<p><i>"Whoopee!"</i> yelled Marvie again. "Hey, Ben!"</p>
<p>Hettie realized now that something was up, so she started to
run across the log bridge. When she got halfway she saw Ben rush
out on the porch, in his shirt sleeves, rifle in hand.</p>
<p>"What's the matter, Marv?" he shouted.</p>
<p>"CALIFORNIA RED'S BACK!" bellowed Marvie, coming to a
halt.</p>
<p>Hettie saw Ben start as if struck. Then he ran to meet Marvie.
Hettie lost little time getting over the bridge and across the
grassy bench. Breathless and excited she arrived in time to see
Ben sink down on a log, as if overcome. Ina came running in her
dressing-gown.</p>
<p>"Oh, Ben--who--what is it?" she cried, in alarm.</p>
<p>"Glory be! Ina, Red is back."</p>
<p>"That all? I thought we were attacked by rustlers. Marvie, you
can yell like a demon."</p>
<p>"Ben, I'm--so glad," panted Hettie.</p>
<p>"Boy, you're not playin' a trick on me--because I was sore on
you?" implored Ben of Marvie.</p>
<p>"Nope, I saw him sure. An' I was tickled to death."</p>
<p>"Aw! . . . Reckon Dillon fetched him back," sighed Ben, in
unutterable gratitude.</p>
<p>"Dillon, hell!" exclaimed Marvie, evidently provoked out of
his radiant pleasure of being the first to inform his boss about
the return of his beloved favorite. "Dillon is in bed. There's
nobody up but me."</p>
<p>"Ahuh! By George! Did you see anyone?"</p>
<p>"Not a soul."</p>
<p>"Well! That beats me. Let's go down. Ina, get some clothes on
if you're comin'. Tell the kid. This'll sure tickle him."</p>
<p>Ben and Marvie, with Hettie trying to keep beside them,
stalked down off the ridge, into the lane, through the courtyard,
and on to the corrals. Three times during that swift walk Ben
asked the same question and three times Marvie made the same
reply. Raidy appeared on the bunkhouse porch and he carried a
rifle.</p>
<p>"Boss, what's the bellarin' about?" he queried, as he joined
the trio. Marvie led the way through two corrals, and then across
the wide square to a high pasture fence, up which he scrambled
like a squirrel.</p>
<p>"There!" he shouted, pointing.</p>
<p>Ben surmounted the fence ahead of Hettie, and his wondering
exultant cry prepared her.</p>
<p>California Red stood not far distant, down along the fence.
Nervously he jerked up at Ben's cry, and wheeled with head high,
ears up, eyes wild. How sensitive, splendid he looked to
Hettie!</p>
<p>Ben whistled and began to call: "Red--Red, old boy, come here,
Red!"</p>
<p>The stallion lost his alarm, and laying down his ears he
approached slowly, step by step. Ben kept calling. Red knew the
voice and showed increasing gladness. He whinnied. Then he
trotted straight to where Ben straddled the fence. He looked the
worse for his absence. Ragged, scratched, muddy, somewhat
thinner, he showed the effect of hard travel and probably harsh
treatment.</p>
<p>"Ben, somebody's been mean to him, else he wouldn't come
hankerin' to you thet way," declared Raidy.</p>
<p>"By Heaven! if that's true!" cried Ben, fiercely, and reaching
out his hand he called again. "Come, Red. Come, old boy. Don't
you know your boss?"</p>
<p>But Red would not come all the way. He halted uncertain,
pawing the ground. His dark eyes shone softly. Again he whinnied.
Ben guardedly got down off the fence, speaking all the time, and
slowly went up to Red, finally encircling the noble neck with his
arm. Then he buried his face in the red mane.</p>
<p>Hettie's thoughts went back to the Forlorn River days when
California Red had roamed the sage hills, free and proud, when
Ben had been a lonely, outcast, wild-horse hunter, and when
Nevada had come so mysteriously into their lives. Hettie's eyes
dimmed. She could not understand Ben's great and passionate love
for that grand horse, but she felt sympathy for him and rejoiced
in his happiness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the cowboys had arrived on the scene. Raidy had
opened the pasture gate. Presently Ben led the stallion through
to the square.</p>
<p>"Look him over, Raidy," said Ben.</p>
<p>While the cowboys crowded around and Hettie still stayed on
the fence, the better to see, the old horseman walked round Red,
feeling him, examining him, lifting his hoofs one after the
other.</p>
<p>"Wal, boss, he's as sound as a bullet," declared Raidy,
gladly. "Ganted up a little an' got a couple of bad cuts. An'
he's lost a shoe. Nervous an' skittish. But you can bet he's glad
to git home; an' far as I can see he's no wuss for bein'
stolen."</p>
<p>"Raidy, do you still hang to that opinion?" inquired Ben.</p>
<p>"I sure do. They ain't anything else to it. Why, man, don't
you know hosses? Can't you see he's been haltered an'
hobbled?"</p>
<p>"Aw, no!" said Ben.</p>
<p>"Sure. Look thar. Use your eyes, boss. You got him back an' I
reckon you'll keep him this time. But don't let your love for the
hoss blind you to facts."</p>
<p>Raidy kept running gentle, skillful hands over Red, ruffling
up the silky hair, looking with the eyes of long experience to
marks and signs by which he read something of what had happened
to the horse.</p>
<p>"See for yourself," went on Raidy, with vehemence. "Look hyar!
. . . By Gawd! he's been roped, too!"</p>
<p>At this point Hettie espied Dillon stalk around the corner of
the high fence, which had obscured the men and horse. Abruptly he
halted. Swift amaze and consternation leaped across his
expression of curiosity, blotting it out. Then as swiftly his
face changed, smoothing to a smile. What a handsome, pleasant
man! Hettie marveled at his consummate control and acting. But he
could not fool her again. The return of Red was actually as
startling to Dillon as it had been to anyone else there.</p>
<p>The circle of cowboys opened to admit Dillon.</p>
<p>"Ha! So, boss, what'd I tell you?" he broke out, and
vigorously shook Ben's hand. It was strange for Hettie to see how
much pleasure that gave Ben. But just then he was up in the
skies. "The old red son-of-a-gun has come back. Jumped the
pasture fence goin' an' comin'. . . . Red, I take off my hat to
you. But you never had me guessin'!"</p>
<p>"Dillon, I had it figured the same," declared Ben.</p>
<p>Raidy snorted his disgust. "An' you once a wild-hoss hunter!
Say, if Red had <i>run</i> off he'd never have come back. I asked
you to take a peep at them marks on him. But you keep huggin' the
hoss an' you won't look."</p>
<p>"Old-timer, I'm so happy to get him back that I don't want to
do anythin' else. Besides, Raidy, on the square, I'd hate to have
it proved he'd been stolen."</p>
<p>"Stolen? That's nonsense, I tell you," interposed Dillon,
testily. "Red took a little run an' come home. I've had many a
hoss do it."</p>
<p>"Not wild hosses, Mister Dillon," snapped Raidy.</p>
<p>"What do you know about hosses, Raidy?"</p>
<p>"Wal, I reckon I've forgot more'n you ever knew," retorted the
older man. "I ain't doubtin' you've <i>had</i> a lot of hosses,
Dillon, but you didn't <i>raise</i> them--you didn't <i>catch</i>
them--an' you didn't <i>keep</i> them long."</p>
<p>This was pretty plain speaking, as was evinced by Ben's
stepping between the men, and the dark flash that wiped out
Dillon's geniality.</p>
<p>"What're you hintin' at?" he queried.</p>
<p>"I'm not hintin'. I'm tellin' you, that's all. An' you can
like it or lump it."</p>
<p>Ben raised a hand to silence Raidy. "That'll do. You're both
privileged to your opinions, but don't get nasty."</p>
<p>"All right, boss," replied Raidy, in an aggrieved tone. "But
my word is sort of ridiculed hyar. An' I'm askin' thet you look
at these marks on Red. If you won't I reckon I'll take it as a
slap at me, an' I'll quit you cold."</p>
<p>"Raidy!" exclaimed Ben, astounded.</p>
<p>"You know me, boss," returned the old horseman, sturdily.</p>
<p>Ben wavered. It was plain to Hettie that he hoped to keep
peace between, the old and new hands, so valuable to him now. But
Raidy had thrown down his gage and he looked formidable.</p>
<p>"Ben," called Hettie, from the fence, "you've known Raidy all
your life. He taught you how to ride. It's only fair that you
listen to him."</p>
<p>"All right, Raidy, if you feel that bad about it," replied
Ben, resignedly.</p>
<p>Again the old horseman ran his gentle, skillful hands over
Red's supple body, down to the wonderfully muscled legs. "Look
hyar," said Raidy, as he stooped. "He's been hobbled. See! He's
been gone <i>ten</i> days. Thet mark was made no more'n
yesterday."</p>
<p>"Reckon you're right," admitted Ben, as he slowly arose. "I
apologize."</p>
<p>"No apology wanted," said Raidy. "All I want is for you to
come out of your trance. . . . Now look hyar. Look at Red's nose.
He's been roped."</p>
<p>"By thunder! There's been a hackamore on him," ejaculated
Ben.</p>
<p>Dillon was not to be outwitted, and he had swiftly followed
Ben's examination of the horse.</p>
<p>"Damn if Raidy isn't right boss," he exploded, evidently
regretful. "I hadn't even looked at Red. But there are the marks,
plain as print. . . . I apologize, too, Raidy. My mistake."</p>
<p>"Wal, Mister Dillon, I'm acceptin' your apology," drawled
Raidy, his keen old hawk eyes on the handsome foreman.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hettie was riding beside Marvie, across the western end of the
sage flat, toward the fence which marked the limit of Ben Ide's
ranch land.</p>
<p>Marvie dismounted to open the gate for them, and when he
vaulted to the saddle again he grinned. "Nobody but Raidy saw us,
an' he won't tell. But Ben would stand for anythin' to-day. Gee!
how he loves that red horse!"</p>
<p>"He does indeed. Well, I love California Red, too."</p>
<p>"Ben's daffy over him. Gave me a hundred dollars, just for
seein' Red first!"</p>
<p>"Early to bed, early to rise, makes a boy healthy, wealthy,
and--"</p>
<p>"Gee! I do feel rich!" interrupted Marvie. "An' I'd like to
fly to town an' back. But it'll keep."</p>
<p>"Marvie, were you looking at Dillon when he first came on us
and saw Red?" inquired Hettie.</p>
<p>"No, I wasn't. Why?" returned Marvie, turning to eye her.</p>
<p>"He struck me as being more amazed than any of us, and
<i>not</i> so happy."</p>
<p>"Ahuh!" replied Marvie. It was evident that he chose to be
noncommittal. Hettie, however, did not fail to catch the glint in
his eye.</p>
<p>"Raidy and Dillon are at odds," she continued. "That's
plain."</p>
<p>"Wasn't Dillon the slick one, though, when he turned the
tables on Raidy?" rejoined Marvie, as if impelled.</p>
<p>"Yes. He's too clever for men. It takes a woman to see through
him."</p>
<p>"I'll bet <i>daylight</i> will show through him--presently,"
returned Marvie, in dark significance.</p>
<p>"Marv, you are absorbing a lot of Arizona."</p>
<p>"Here's where we turn off, Hettie," said Marvie, as he left
the road. "Narrow trail, but good. Look out for the brush an'
duck the branches. Ride now!"</p>
<p>He spurred his horse into a lope and Hettie did likewise. Soon
they entered the forest, where the shade was welcome and no dust
arose. Hettie had been on this trail several times, though not to
go very far. It led west, toward the brakes and the frowning dark
notches of the Mogollons, dim and purple in the distance. Soon
they passed the limit of Hettie's experience in that direction, a
fact which gave her a thrill. She scarcely had a chance, however,
to look at the scenery, for Marvie was making time, and she had
to watch her horse and the low branches.</p>
<p>They rode perhaps five miles before the trail began to
penetrate deeper into the forest and to ascend into rockier and
rougher country. They climbed high, and Hettie had a glimpse now
and then of the red desert far to the north, and the black slopes
beneath her, falling away to the west. She soon gathered what the
brakes of the Mogollons meant. The brakes were canyons, running
like the ridges of a washboard, walled with brush and rock,
choked with dense thickets, above which the lofty pines and
spruces towered. Ridge after ridge Marvie climbed and descended,
until coming to a deeper, clearer canyon he turned off to follow
a willow-bordered stream.</p>
<p>As they progressed, again riding at a lope, the canyon widened
and deepened, the walls grew rugged and unscalable, the fringe of
pines on the rims lifted higher, and every aspect of the
wilderness seemed likewise intensified. The time came when the
horses had to walk again, down and down, under narrow gray
shelves of stone, under the massed foliage of maple, oak, aspen,
all beginning to show a tint of autumn, especially the fluttering
aspens, just turning to gold. The stream grew larger, swifter,
deeper, and its mellow roar filled the dreamy solitude.</p>
<p>At corners, where the trail turned, Marvie always exercised a
caution which added more than romance to Hettie's feelings. This
adventure grew with the miles. How dark, still, lonely some of
the constrictions in this brake of the Mogollons!</p>
<p>Turkeys ran fleetly from the open grass patches into the
thickets; deer walked up the steep wooded slopes; elk stopped
their browsing on the willows to gaze at the disturbers of their
solitude; beaver slipped off their muddy dams to make swirls in
the still green pools; squirrels chattered; jays squalled; ravens
croaked; hawks sailed across the blue strip of sky overhead.</p>
<p>"Somewhere along here we'll meet her," whispered Marvie,
fearfully. "It always scares me. That Cedar Hatt might be
prowlin' along the rim to spy us. Rose is cute, though. I've
waited half a day before she came."</p>
<p>They wound along the crooked trail, and if it were possible,
Hettie imagined every vista wilder and more hauntingly beautiful
than the last. The white bleached grass, the green willows, the
amber rocks, the rushing foaming brook, the thickets of oak and
aspen, russet and gold, the wonderful walls rising sheer, stained
and mossy, gray and purple, up to the ragged fringed rims--all
these aided the movement of leaves, the flash of birds, the
fragrance of pine, the utter solitude, into working an
enchantment upon Hettie's senses. No wonder Marvie had fallen in
love with his wild Rose.</p>
<p>"I see her horse," whispered Marvie, as he halted. "She'll be
near. We'll get off now. I'll hide our horses in the aspen
thicket."</p>
<p>Hettie got off to hand her bridle to him, and waited while he
led their mounts out of sight. How noiselessly he moved! Marvie
had become a woodsman. Soon he returned and led her off the trail
into the grass.</p>
<p>"Anyone ridin' along behind us would sure see our tracks," he
whispered. "But that's a slim chance. You see it's an old unused
trail here. The Hatts live over in the next canyon."</p>
<p>"She's a brave kid, to meet you this way. And you're not such
a coward, Marvie, boy," returned Hettie.</p>
<p>He led her up a gradual grassy slope, into the protecting
shelter of low pines and silver spruces. "Look at the elk beds,"
he whispered, pointing to round places where grass and moss had
been flattened.</p>
<p>Hettie espied a ragged red pony, without a saddle, haltered to
a sapling. Then she saw a dark curly head rise above the tall
grass. Next moment Marvie was speaking low: "Hettie, this is Rose
Hatt. . . . Rose, I've fetched her. This's Hettie Ide, my best
friend an' sort of sister."</p>
<p>As Hettie sank down, smiling, with hands outstretched, the
girl rose to her knees, her eyes dilating, her face without
color.</p>
<p>"Rose, I'm glad--to meet you," whispered Hettie, pantingly,
and she kissed the girl.</p>
<p>"Oh, Miss Ide--you're good to come," faltered Rose. She was
trembling all over. This child of the wilderness was nothing less
than terrified at meeting one of Marvie's kin.</p>
<p>Marvie knelt beside Rose, and it was evident this was a
torturing moment for him, too. The romance and excitement had
passed. Ben Ide's sister was now face to face with the daughter
of rustler and backwoodsman Elam Hatt, with the sister of
notorious Cedar Hatt.</p>
<p>"Hettie, I reckon Rose won't be so scared an' shy if I leave
you alone with her," said Marvie. "So I'll keep watch below. An'
don't forget we haven't lots of time."</p>
<p>Then with a bright and reassuring look at Rose he slipped off
under the low-spreading trees. Hettie turned to the girl, trying
to think of words to put her at ease. How like a woodland wild
flower! Rose wore a buckskin blouse fringed and beaded, a ragged
brown skirt, and boots without stockings. She held a sprig of
tiny aspen leaves, turning gold.</p>
<p>"Rose, since Marvie loves you, I must love you, too," said
Hettie, speaking not what she had intended, but the words that
welled from her heart. She did not need to be told that Rose Hatt
had never had love of mother, sister, or friend. The girl gave a
little gasping cry of wonder and pain, then fell into Hettie's
arms, where she burst into tears.</p>
<p>This made the ordeal easier for Hettie, and she held the girl
in silence until the paroxysms of weeping had subsided. Then she
began to talk, kindly, soothingly, as if to a child, saying she
hardly knew what, until the moment came when she felt she might
venture a question. But before she could ask it Rose sat up,
wiped her wet face, and smiled through her tears.</p>
<p>"Marvie was right," she said. "It's sure good to see you, hear
you, now I'm over my scare. I'll never forget you till my dyin'
day."</p>
<p>"Rose, you love Marvie, very much?" said Hettie, venturing to
open the serious interview.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the girl, simply. "I couldn't help it. But I
didn't know at first. Not till the dance."</p>
<p>"Then you two have pledged your troth?"</p>
<p>"If you mean told our love, yes--Miss Ide. But I didn't
promise to marry Marvie."</p>
<p>"He asked you, of course?"</p>
<p>"He begged me to," replied the girl, lifting her head with
pride.</p>
<p>"Why did you refuse?"</p>
<p>"I love Marvie too well to hurt him with you an' all his
family."</p>
<p>"Do you mean you think you'd disgrace him and us because
you're a Hatt?"</p>
<p>"Yes, an' a good deal more I haven't told Marvie," she went
on, steady of voice, though her round breast heaved. "Cedar would
come down on Marvie an' you an' your brother Ben for money. An'
so would another man whose name I daren't tell. He--this man--has
got a hold on Cedar--an' me. He'd ruin us all."</p>
<p>"Rose, that's a strong statement," said Hettie. "But even if
it isn't exaggerated it doesn't change the fact that you and
Marvie ought to wait. You're both very young."</p>
<p>"I'm not exaggeratin'. I could tell you more. An' about
marryin'--Marvie's reason for hurry is to get me away from the
life I live. It's tumble, Miss Ide. I have to cook, wash, scrub
for an outfit of rustlers an' hoss-thieves. Look at my hands!
Look at the black marks--here--an' there. I get kicked an' beat.
Marvie knows an' he can't stand it any longer."</p>
<p>"Could you not leave this home?" queried Hettie,
earnestly.</p>
<p>"I've thought of that. Yes. I could. My dad wouldn't care. But
I'd have to be a servant--or worse."</p>
<p>"No, indeed. Rose, you could come to my home."</p>
<p>"Oh, how--wonderful!" gasped the girl, rapturously clasping
her hands. "But that'd be 'most the same as marryin' Marvie, so
far as Cedar an'--that other man are concerned. . . . No, it'd
never do. But thank you--bless you!"</p>
<p>"Rose, we mustn't despair," continued Hettie, touched to the
heart by this girl's sincerity. "Time will help us. If you could
only escape this--this drudgery and shame."</p>
<p>"That's the hope which keeps me up, Miss Ide. If I could only
tide over a little time! Cedar is goin' to hell fast. He's
rustlin', gamblin', drinkin' harder than ever. He's under the
thumb of--the man I daren't squeal on."</p>
<p>"But why daren't you?"</p>
<p>"Because if <i>he</i> didn't kill me, Cedar would. I'm the
only one outside of this Pine Tree outfit who <i>knows.</i> An'
my life ain't worth much."</p>
<p>"Pine Tree outfit!" echoed Hettie, her eyes lighting. "That's
the mysterious gang of rustlers."</p>
<p>"It sure is. I'm trustin' you with my life, Miss Hettie. But I
daren't tell more. Nobody knows how secrets slip out. You might
talk in your sleep."</p>
<p>"Naturally. But I think you could risk it, considering I sleep
alone," said Hettie. "Rose, this <i>is</i> a plot. We're all
involved. Your people and mine. What a tangle! It must have been
fate that brought you and Marvie together. Oh, if I only knew how
best to advise you."</p>
<p>"Reckon I wish so, too. But I've got a hunch. It's my job to
stick home--to fool my people--to learn all I can--to fight that
devil off who--who . . . I must see Marvie very seldom an' be
sure we're never ketched. Somethin' will happen, Miss Ide. You've
made me feel it. You made things different. Neither Cedar--nor
<i>him,</i> can last long in this country. Not now. I heard my
dad say so. . . . Oh, this is the second time my hopes have
risen. Oh, I wish I could tell you of another friend I found
lately. I forgot. . . . But he came to my house an' there was
hell. I listened at night through the chinks of the logs. Cedar
was wild. Cash Burridge was there. 'We've got a big deal on,'
says Cash. An' that pleased all the gang except Cedar. They set
to whisperin' an' I heard no more."</p>
<p>"Rose--isn't your friend--Jim Lacy?" whispered Hettie,
haltingly, with dry lips.</p>
<p>The girl caught her breath and drew back sharply, wonder the
most predominant of her varying emotions.</p>
<p>"There, you have betrayed it," continued Hettie, forcefully,
trying to command her voice. "Call Marvie now. We will plan
another meeting, then hurry home. I've enough to think of--this
time."</p>
<p>Rose silently slipped away under the pines, and Hettie,
staring at the green-walled foliage, seemed to see a ghost. "Oh,
my God!" she whispered in agony. "Nevada belongs to this
thieving, vile crew!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c16" id="c16">SIXTEEN</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Frost fell early in September on the high rims of the
Mogollons. Soon after the sun set the rarefied air became cold
and sharp, making a campfire something to draw the riders and
hunters, and other men of the woodland.</p>
<p>A group of five dark-faced, dark-garbed campers sat around a
beautiful opal-hearted cedar fire, at the wild edge of Black
Butte, where it fell sheer into the brakes. Three of the men were
playing cards, cross-legged in front of a saddle blanket,
intensely intent on the greasy bits of colored pasteboard and the
piles of gold coin and rolls of greenbacks. They were
gambling--the absorbing pastime of all dyed-in-the-wool
rustlers.</p>
<p>The other two men occupied a position on the opposite side of
the fire. One had his back and his outspread palms to the blaze,
while the other sat against a log.</p>
<p>"Hell, Jim," swore the standing man, flicking a hand toward
the gamblers, "they couldn't hear the crack of doom. They'll
gamble there all night or till one of them has all the money. An'
what difference would it make now--if they did hear what you
say?"</p>
<p>"Wal, Cash, the fact is I'm not used to crowds," replied the
other. "It takes long to get acquainted. An' you know I can never
be shore of any man."</p>
<p>"That's the price you pay for leadership. Reckon it's the same
among honest businessmen in the world as among rustlers an'
gunmen. But I didn't mean to split hairs over it. I was just
complainin' because you're so close-mouthed."</p>
<p>"What of it, Burridge?" queried Jim, somewhat acidly. "I shore
talk plenty to you, don't I, when we're alone?"</p>
<p>"Course you do, Jim," answered Burridge. "All I want to get at
is this. If you'd loosen up a little more, drink an' gamble a
little, especially when we run into other outfits, it'd
facilitate our plans."</p>
<p>"I reckon, Cash," returned Jim, wearily. "But how can I have a
quick eye an' hand if I drink? I'll agree, though, to be more
friendly an' set in a game now an' then."</p>
<p>"Good! Reckon that'll do. Lord, Jim, don't get me wrong! Ever
since you called Hardy Rue out an' killed him I've been ready to
crawl an' wear my fingernails off scratchin' for you. I mayn't
have been your friend back in Lineville, but I sure love you now.
You've put me on my feet again."</p>
<p>"Wal, Cash, that's plain talk," replied Jim. "An' I don't mind
sayin' I like you better than I used to. But I can't love any man
or even be pards."</p>
<p>"Sure, sure I understand," returned Burridge, hastily. "An'
I'm damn glad for small favors. But you needn't tell that to our
gang or any of these outfits we meet. They all think you were my
pard back in California an' are yet. Burt Stillwell would have
shot me, surer than the Lord made little apples. But he was
afraid of you. He was undecided. He couldn't be himself, an' I'm
tellin' you he was a bad <i>hombre."</i></p>
<p>"Aw, bad, yes, in a sense of dirty yellow behind-your-back
viciousness," agreed Jim, flashing a quick eloquent hand. "I hate
to throw a gun on such fodder. But he forced it. He kept still
till he got a few drinks. Then he r'iled up aboot Ben Ide's red
horse, an' he put in that ridiculous claim for his pard, Cedar
Hatt. Wanted a share of the divvy for the cattle--for this Hatt
fellow."</p>
<p>"The hell he did! Well, I wondered what it was about. But I
was so glad I didn't feel no curiosity," returned Burridge; he
turned round to kick the fire-logs. Then again he faced his
companion. "Maybe you don't know it, Lacy, but you made a lot of
friends by pluggin' Stillwell, an' one sure-enough enemy."</p>
<p>"Who's that? This Cedar Hatt?"</p>
<p>"He's the bird. A red-tailed buzzard, an' no mistake. He's a
backwoodsman, Jim, like an Indian, who knows the woods. Cedar
wouldn't ever try you out, unless, like Burt, he'd been lookin'
at the bottle. All the same you'll be in more danger from Cedar
than from all the gun-throwers in Arizona. He's killed shepherds
an' cowboys enough, believe me. He'll trail you--ambush you in
the woods."</p>
<p>"Much obliged, Cash," drawled Jim, yawning. "Reckon I'd better
look out for this heah Cedar Hatt."</p>
<p>"I'm givin' you a hunch of hunches," declared Burridge. "I'm
most damn honest an' selfish about it, too. I've other reasons
beside affection not to want Jim Lacy killed. Cedar Hatt will be
sore enough when he hears you put Stillwell over, but, say, when
he learns you got that red stallion an' sent him back to Ide--my
Gawd! brother, he'll be hell's fire!"</p>
<p>"How soon is he goin' to find out?" queried Lacy, with more
interest. "Stillwell cain't very wal tell. An' that pard of
Stillwell's--Babe Morgan, some one called him--he'll be runnin'
yet."</p>
<p>"Cedar'll find out <i>pronto,"</i> declared Burridge. "If not
from some one outside our outfit, then from some one inside. For
you were playin' a queer high hand, Jim, when you took the
stallion away from Burt an' Babe an' sent it back to the Ide
ranch. They'd stolen it. Your argument sounded good to me. Ben
Ide would raise more hell over the loss of California Red than a
hundred thousand head of stock."</p>
<p>"Huh! I'll bet he would," declared Lacy, dropping his head.
The twig he had been twirling in his fingers snapped sharply.</p>
<p>"Well, to go on, your argument looked good to me. Now I've got
brains, an' most of these rustlin' <i>hombres</i> haven't nothin'
but spruce gum in their heads. That deal looked queer to all our
outfit. Still, only Hubrigg opened his trap to say so. Hubrigg
likes you, though, an' I think you can gamble on him."</p>
<p>Here Burridge leaned over toward Jim to whisper: "If our gang
seem a little standoffish yet, it's only your reputation. Since
you helped us to steal cattle an' drive them an' sell them, why,
they're sure you are one of us, even if you are Jim Lacy."</p>
<p>"Reckon that ought to be aboot enough," returned Lacy.</p>
<p>He turned his ear to the faint cold wind that breathed up out
of the black void below.</p>
<p>"Hear anythin'?" queried Burridge.</p>
<p>"Rollin' stones. Might be deer on the trail."</p>
<p>"Might be Stagg, too, an' I'll gamble it is. For he's
overdue."</p>
<p>"Listen," rejoined Lacy, holding up a sensitive hand.</p>
<p>Both men turned their heads sidewise to the wind and waited.
Fitfully the faint wind mourned through the forest. From far
below floated up a soft murmur of tumbling stream. Solitude and
silence seemed to be emphasized by these wilderness factors. The
campfire cracked; the gamblers slapped their cards and clinked
their gold.</p>
<p>"Heah anythin'?" asked Lacy, suddenly relaxing.</p>
<p>"Sure. A lot of night sounds, includin' our gamblin' pards
here, but no hoss," returned Burridge.</p>
<p>"Wal, I heah a hoss," said Lacy.</p>
<p>"Good! That'll be Stagg, unless it might be one of our hosses.
I'll take a look an' then I'll unroll my bed."</p>
<p>Burridge stalked away in the gloom of the forest, while Lacy,
left alone, attended to the campfire. Once or twice he glanced at
the absorbed gamesters, with something curious, strange, and
menacing in his eyes. Then he fell to contemplation of the opal
heart of the campfire. He watched it, the glow and sparkle and
white shade and pearly red. And the moment arrived when he forgot
the wild environment, the gambling rustlers, to become like a
statue, cold-faced, with haunted eyes. He must have seen a ghost
in the radiant embers, for not till a thud of hoofs sounded close
at hand did he rouse out of his trance.</p>
<p>Presently two dark forms entered the circle of light, and
approached, talking low. Lacy got up to meet them.</p>
<p>"Howdy, Jim!" greeted the newcomer with Burridge. He was a
swarthy-faced, beady-eyed white man with a strain of Indian or
Mexican blood.</p>
<p>"Howdy, Stagg! Did you make a good job of it?" returned Lacy,
with apparent carelessness.</p>
<p>"Wasn't no job a-tall," said Stagg, reaching bare grimy hands
toward the fire. "Soon as you-all left, the red hoss quieted
down, an' I coaxed him out of thet measly leetle corral. He din't
like thet. An' after he found out I was leadin' him home he
didn't make no more fuss. An' we made fast time. Reckon it was
nigh on midnight when we got down on the sage. I tied up both
hosses, pulled off my boots, put on my moccasins, an' led the
stallion five miles through grass an' sage. When I run into Ide's
fence I kept goin' along till I come to a gate. I opened it an'
let him in."</p>
<p>"Much obliged, Stagg. I--reckon it was no fool move of
mine--though some think different," replied Lacy, turning his
face away from the fire.</p>
<p>"Lacy, it was the slickest piece of headwork I ever seen on
this range," declared Stagg. "I hadn't time to tell you I was at
Burton's ranch the next day after Stillwell stole the stallion.
Ide's cowmen came rarin' over the country. Thet Raidy, he's an
old hand, an' he was mad as a hornet. An' to-day as I was
climbin' the Hogback I run into a sheepherder I know. Greaser
named Juan somethin'. He said Ide had plastered the trees along
the trails, offerin' reward for Red."</p>
<p>"There, Jim--you see, it was a wise move," declared Burridge,
with satisfaction. "Young Ide would have spent a fortune gettin'
back that stallion. Well, he sure was grand hoss-flesh. I only
looked at him once. If I'd looked twice I'd been a hoss-thief,
too."</p>
<p>Lacy stared out into the gloom of the forest.</p>
<p>"Reckon you're hungry?" asked Burridge of the arrival.</p>
<p>"Had a bite at Hatt's to-day," returned Stagg. "But a chuck of
deer meat an' a cup of coffee wouldn't go bad."</p>
<p>"We got roast turkey. Young gobbler that Jim shot the head off
as we was ridin' along."</p>
<p>"Wal, friend Jim must pack a shotgun," replied Stagg, with an
attempt at facetiousness.</p>
<p>"Nope. Only that old six-shooter."</p>
<p>Lacy turned from the darkness to the firelight. "Stagg, did
you see any of the Hatts?"</p>
<p>"Sure. They was all home, an' had company, too. Strangers to
me."</p>
<p>"Did you tell them about takin' Red back to the Ide
ranch?"</p>
<p>"Sure. Thought it a good idee. An' I rubbed it in, too. Elam's
no hoss-thief. He said hoss-stealin' was a low-down bizness. But
Cedar swore there was somethin' crooked about a gunman an'
rustler who returned stolen property. Also he swore he'd steal
the red stallion again, jest to spite you."</p>
<p>"Ahuh. Wal, what did Cedar say when he heahed I'd shot his
pard, Burt Stillwell?" inquired Jim, in a dry, caustic tone.</p>
<p>"What?" queried Stagg, with a start.</p>
<p>"You heahed me, man."</p>
<p>"Sure. But it--I . . . An' you shot Burt?"</p>
<p>Lacy nodded coldly, eying the fire.</p>
<p>Stagg stiffened a little, and after a stultified pause glanced
from Burridge to Lacy, and then out into the forest. A silence
ensued, broken only by the gamblers.</p>
<p>"Burt's dead--then--of course?" asked Stagg, presently, with
an effort.</p>
<p>Cash Burridge broke the strange spell of the moment.</p>
<p>"Burt's under the sod an' the leaves, waitin' the Judgment
Day. An' it was a damn good job, Stagg."</p>
<p>"No arguin' ag'in' thet," returned Stagg, recovering to grin.
"Wal, Lacy, fact is Cedar Hatt hadn't heerd no more'n me. But if
you're curious, I can sure tell you--Cedar will be hoppin'
mad."</p>
<p>"I told Jim that," said Burridge, impatiently. "What's it
amount to, anyhow? There'll be a Hatt less <i>pronto</i>."</p>
<p>"Wal, pards, the population of this hyar Arizonie is sure
deterioratin'," returned Stagg, with a guffaw.</p>
<p>One of the gamesters, disturbed by the loud laugh, looked up
to say, "Bill, shet your loud mouth, an' come set in this game.
Hubrigg an' Brann ain't very much to stack up ag'in'."</p>
<p>His bold face and rolling eyes expressed exceeding
gratification while he clinked his pile of gold.</p>
<p>"I'm on," replied Stagg, eagerly. "Wait till I swaller some
grub."</p>
<p>"How about you--Lacy?" inquired Brann, with marked hesitation.
"We ain't slightin' you. It's an open game."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Brann," drawled Lacy. "I'd hate to win your pile. You
see, I've got uncommon good eyes, an' it shore hurts my feelin's
to see you men slippin' aces around. I'm a caird sharp. I'd break
you. Like as not, then, you'd get sore an' pull a gun--which
would be bad for this outfit."</p>
<p>Long and loud rolled the mirth of Burridge and Stagg down the
aisles of the forest. Brann appeared a droll and good-humored
rustler. He stared hard at Lacy, finally grinning.</p>
<p>"Jim, I'm recallin' thet invite for you to set in," he said,
meaningly.</p>
<p>"Gamble your heads off," spoke up Burridge. "We needn't break
camp till late to-morrow. But I'm turnin' in."</p>
<p>"Same for me," said Lacy, and strode out of the lighted
circle. Presently he had to feel his way to the black tent-like
spruce tree under which he had spread his tarpaulin and blankets.
Sitting down, he pulled off his boots. Then he sat motionless,
peering back at the ruddy campfire. Presently he removed his coat
and made a pillow of it. Next he unbuckled his gun belt, took it
off, and laid the gun under the edge of his coat. After that he
gazed a long time out into the spectral forest. The wind had
risen, and sang through the pines. A deep wild bay of a wolf rang
out. How lonely, hungry, mournful!</p>
<p>"Reckon that poor lofer is like me," muttered Lacy, and rolled
in his blankets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The ring of a cold ax on hardwood awakened Jim Lacy from his
slumbers.</p>
<p>There was a white frost on his tarpaulin and his boots and his
sombrero, also his nose, from the feel of it. Hubrigg, who
appeared to be an agreeable and helpful chap, was chopping wood
for a campfire.</p>
<p>"Nifty mawnin', Hub," said Jim, by way of greeting. "I'll pack
some water."</p>
<p>"Hullo! I reckon your conscious never lets you sleep," said
Hubrigg. "Look at them stiffs there. Dead to the world. Now
watch."</p>
<p>With that he snatched up a bucket, pounded it with the ax
handle, then tossed it to Lacy. The rustlers, rudely disturbed,
leaped out of their beds, wild-eyed, hair on end, every one of
them holding a gun or reaching for one.</p>
<p>"Haw! Haw! Haw!" roared Hubrigg. "Wake up, you sour-dough
eaters, an' help at the chores."</p>
<p>All of his roused hearers, except Burridge, cursed him
roundly, and Burridge, when he realized what had happened, said,
"Lord, I thought my day had come!"</p>
<p>Jim Lacy went down the trail for a pail of water.</p>
<p>Whenever such duty as this, or other opportunity, afforded, he
always took advantage of it, seeking ever a moment away from the
rustlers with whom he had cast his lot. That time, however short,
was a blessed relief. He need not then be perpetually on the
<i>qui vive,</i> watching, listening, reading the minds of his
companions. In those stolen moments or hours he reverted to his
old character, Nevada, lover of the open, of desert and forest,
of the life and color and mystery of nature.</p>
<p>The sun had not yet arisen. To the east the sky, over the long
arms of the Mogollons, reaching, sweeping down black and wild,
had begun to flush rosily. The forest seemed awakening from its
slumber with the bark of squirrels and screech of jays, the bugle
of bull elk, and the sweet, plaintive twittering of canaries.
Rocks and grass showed the hoary coating of frost. The air
nipped, and the water at the spring felt like ice to his face.
There was a thin edge of crystal ice along the margin of the
little pool.</p>
<p>Upon climbing back to the rim he paused a moment to gaze down
into that marvelous black basin called the brakes of the
Mogollons. They were really not black, though black predominated
over the rich gold of aspens, and the scarlet of maples, the
russet of oaks, and the vivid cerise of vines for which he had no
name. A ragged pine-speared slope fell almost perpendicularly to
the ribbed and ridged lowland below, and here and there
outcroppings of gray crags and yellow shafts added to the effect
of an exceedingly broken country. His experienced eye wandered
down to the brakes, over what from that height appeared
undulating ridge and swale. Its vastness amazed Jim Lacy. Here
was a wilderness country as large as the northern California he
knew so well. And to increase the effect to one of staggering
conception, there stretched the desert, grand and illimitable. He
had a moment of silent ecstasy of appreciation, followed by a
melancholy longing for a time when he might be free to love
Arizona, to have a ranch of his own, a few horses and cattle, a
home in the wilds where he could hunt and ride, free to live
peacefully, dreaming of the past. Melancholy longing because he
knew it could never come true!</p>
<p>Returning to the campfire, he arrived in time to hear Brann
exclaim: "What'n hell Columbia for do we want to ring the Hatts
in on this deal?"</p>
<p>"Say, man, there's brains back of this deal," replied
Burridge, derisively.</p>
<p>"Meanin' yours, eh? Wal, all right, but I'm from
Missouri."</p>
<p>They ceased the argument at the approach of Jim Lacy.</p>
<p>"Somebody rustle the hosses," called out Burridge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An hour later the six men, with as many pack horses, started
over the rim on the trail down into the brakes. It was a trail
that would cause even the most expert and daring rider to
hesitate before attempting it on horseback. Moreover, it was
seldom used. Lacy decided it must be a rear outlet from the
rendezvous of desperate men. Many a time axes had to be brought
into requisition to enable pack horses to pass down. Jumble of
rocks, weathered slides, narrow slanting ledges, fallen trees and
thick brush, made this Hatt trail one to remember.</p>
<p>But though very steep, it was not long. It let out into the
head of a canyon where the stream gushed forth from under an
amber-mossed cliff, and went singing down through a winding
defile, surely the wildest and most beautiful that Jim Lacy's
eyes had ever beheld.</p>
<p>"Cash, tell me," said Lacy, at an opportune time, when they
rode abreast, "is Cedar Hatt the haid of this Pine Tree
outfit?"</p>
<p>"Hell no!" ejaculated Burridge, in ridicule. Then as an
afterthought he continued: "But, Jim, I don't <i>know</i> he
isn't. I mean I've sense enough to figure he couldn't be. There's
a real man at the reins of that gang."</p>
<p>"You're square now? You honestly don't know?"</p>
<p>"So help me Heaven!" returned Burridge, raising his gloved
right hand. "If I knew I'd tell you--even though the man was my
pard. But I don't know. I never met a man who did. Of course no
one is goin' to brag about that. The Pine Tree outfit is only
three years old. It's got a brand, but sure no one ever seen it
on a steer or a calf. I never seen it on anythin'. I hear it's
cut on aspen trees. Sheepherders will tell you that."</p>
<p>"Cedar Hatt might belong to it?" queried Lacy.</p>
<p>"Sure. But he'd be a bad <i>hombre</i> to trust, unless you
had some hold on him. My idea of the Pine Tree outfit is this.
Some slick rustler from other parts has ridden in here, either
with a few choice men or picked them carefully after he got here,
an' he has the money an' the brains to control a small outfit.
Some cowboy found a stray steer on the range. It had its brand
painted out. Painted! That's new. But how the devil could they
paint out the brands on a big bunch of wild steers?"</p>
<p>"Not very practical," observed Jim, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"It's no trick to steal cattle in this country, an' it's a
heap sight easier to sell them," declared Burridge. "But to do it
on a big scale an' not be found out--I call that brains."</p>
<p>"How far to the Hatt ranch?"</p>
<p>"Round this next bend. Wonderful place to hole up, don't you
think?"</p>
<p>"Shore is. Are all these canyons like this?"</p>
<p>"Like it? Yes, only rougher. Some of them are so thick you
can't get a hoss through."</p>
<p>When they rode around a high green corner Jim gave vent to an
exclamation of utmost pleasure. The brake opened into an oval
valley surrounded by gray-cliffed, green-thicketed walls, rising
high. A level meadow, where horses and cows grazed in deep grass,
ended in a low bench of land, upon which huge isolated pines and
spruces towered halfway to the rim. Two log cabins stood
picturesquely at the edge of this rise of ground. In the
background a corral and barn, with logs awry and roof caved in,
showed half hidden in a blaze of golden aspens.</p>
<p>"Here's where the Hatts hang out," remarked Burridge. "It's
like a fox den, with two holes. The one we just came down, an' a
pass below where a couple of good shots could stave off all the
cowboys in Arizona."</p>
<p>"Beautiful!" ejaculated Jim, charmed out of his usual
reserve.</p>
<p>"I've been here often. Once tried to buy the place from Hatt.
Not much."</p>
<p>"What do these Hatts live on?" queried Jim, gazing round.</p>
<p>"Meat an' beans an' corn meal. An' they make their own
whiskey. If you take a swill of that it'll knock you flat."</p>
<p>"How many women-folks?"</p>
<p>"Only the kid--Rose. There was a woman here, a while back,
wife of one of the boys, I heard. But I never saw her. . . .
Well, old sharp-eyed Elam sees us already. He's comin' out with a
gun."</p>
<p>The riders in advance drove the pack horses up on the bench,
and followed to dismount. Burridge, arrived a little in advance
of Jim. The old mountaineer, Hatt, stood shaggy-headed, with a
smile of welcome on his craggy face.</p>
<p>"Howdy, Elam! Did you get word I was comin'?"</p>
<p>"Yep, but never expected you so soon."</p>
<p>"Shake hands with Jim Lacy," went on Burridge,
laconically.</p>
<p>"Howdy, sir! Reckon you ain't no stranger, by name," responded
Hatt, offering his hand.</p>
<p>Lacy leaned off his horse to accept Hatt's advance. "Shore
glad to meet you, Elam," he drawled. "Reckon I fell in love with
your homestead, heah. An' I'll hang around till you kick me
out."</p>
<p>"Welcome you air," said Hatt, genially. "We keep open house
fer our friends. Git down an' come in."</p>
<p>Burridge made no offer to introduce Jim to the other Hatts
present, though he called them by name, Tobe and Henny. Cedar
Hatt did not put in an appearance, nor did Lacy's quick eye sight
the girl--Rose.</p>
<p>"Throw yer packs back in the grove," said Hatt. "Jest turn
your hosses loose. Never yit had a hoss leave hyar."</p>
<p>While pack and saddle horses were led back toward the aspen
grove Elam Hatt walked with Burridge, while the two sons
followed. Lacy did not need more than a casual glance at Elam to
define his status. He was a rough, sturdy backwoodsman who had,
no doubt, lived by hunting until an easier vocation had presented
with the ranging of cattle along the Mogollons. The two sons,
however, exhibited nothing to impress favorably. They were
uncouth, unshaven louts with bad teeth and pale eyes, and faces
that indicated very low mentality. Lacy's advent manifestly did
not cause them either apprehension or interest. Tobe was
barefooted. Henny leaned on a short carbine, worn shiny from long
service.</p>
<p>"Where's Cedar?" inquired Burridge, casually.</p>
<p>"He's hyarabouts somewhere," replied Elam. "He seen you
fust."</p>
<p>"Hope Cedar won't take exception to our comin'."</p>
<p>"No tellin' what Cedar'll take," replied Hatt, with a grin.
"But I'm right glad to see you. I'm wantin' news. Make yourself
to home. I'll go an' see about grub. . . . Tobe, whar's your
sister?"</p>
<p>"I dunno," replied the son.</p>
<p>"Find her, you terbaccer-chewin' cub," returned Hatt, and
strode away toward the cabins.</p>
<p>Tobe Hatt might never have heard his father, for all the
attention he paid to the order. Instead he gravitated toward
Lacy.</p>
<p>"Got any smokin'?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Shore. Help yourself there in my saddlebag," replied
Lacy.</p>
<p>The other young Hatt, Henny, now moved out of his tracks, and
dragging the rifle butt over the ground, he joined Tobe in a
search of Lacy's saddlebag. Finding the tobacco, they availed
themselves of Lacy's offer. They took it all.</p>
<p>"Cash, where you goin' to bunk?" asked Lacy, presently.</p>
<p>"Right here in the aspens. Good a place as any. Elam will
offer the loft of the big cabin, but I'd just as lief be
out."</p>
<p>"Wal, I'd a good deal rather," drawled Jim. "Cabin lofts are
full of dirt, spiders, centipedes an' smoke. I'll throw my outfit
somewhere aboot."</p>
<p>"Make it within call, Jim," replied Burridge, not without
significance.</p>
<p>Jim sat down, ostensibly to mend one of his stirrups, but as a
matter of fact he did not care to pick out his bed site under the
pale eyes of these degenerate Hatt boys. He could peer through
the eyes of men to their minds. Either Tobe or Henny would commit
murder for a sack of tobacco. Jim decided he would carry his bed
to a secluded place in the brush and change that place every
night. With covert glances he watched the Hatt boys and also kept
a lookout for Rose.</p>
<p>"Wal, fellars, what about goin' on with our little game?"
inquired Hubrigg.</p>
<p>"Sure," replied Brann.</p>
<p>"I should smile," added Stagg, cheerfully.</p>
<p>Cash Burridge shook his head dubiously, but did not voice his
opinion until the Hatt boys had ambled off out of hearing.</p>
<p>"Say, men, I don't want to be a kill-joy, but honest I
question the sense of showin' all that money here."</p>
<p>"Why not?" asked Hubrigg.</p>
<p>"It might not be safe. We don't belong to this Hatt outfit.
They could have this canyon 'most full of backwoodsmen in no
time. There's only six of us."</p>
<p>"Wal, listen to him!" ejaculated Brann. "You got it wrong,
Cash. There's five of us, an' Jim Lacy!"</p>
<p>"I just don't think it's wise," added Burridge, stubbornly,
ignoring the sarcasm.</p>
<p>"We may have to hang around here for a week or more," spoke up
Stagg. "What'll we do? If we can't gamble we might as well not
have any money."</p>
<p>"Jim, what do you say?" asked Burridge, in perplexity.</p>
<p>"Wal, seein' that money changes hands so often, I reckon
nobody'd miss it if the Hatts did get it," chuckled Jim.</p>
<p>"Haw! Haw!" roared Cash, slapping his knee.</p>
<p>"Miss it!" ejaculated Brann, evidently affronted with
catastrophe. "Say, I look on thet pile as mine."</p>
<p>"Jim, you seem a nice fellar, with fun in your talk, but I'm
sort of doubtful about you," said Hubrigg, dubiously.</p>
<p>"How so?" queried Jim, pleasantly.</p>
<p>"Wal, I can't exactly explain. But when you talk lazy an'
easy, like all you darn Texans, an' look some other way, I always
feel queer."</p>
<p>"Right you are. Our new member makes me feel like a fellar
who's runnin' like hell an' knows sure he's goin' to get the seat
of his pants slung full of buckshot."</p>
<p>This from Brann indicated the slow progress of the rustlers
toward amity with Jim. They all laughed uproariously.</p>
<p>"Shore I must be a likable cuss to have round," declared Jim,
presently. "I've a notion to get sore."</p>
<p>"Wal, for Gawd's sake, don't," burst out Brann. "Be a good
fellar an' set in the game with us."</p>
<p>"I'd like to, for pastime, anyhow. But suppose I catch one of
you manipulatin' the cairds?"</p>
<p>"Huh! Manip-oo-latin'? What's thet?"</p>
<p>"Brann, our friend Jim means slippin' aces off the bottom,
holdin' out, stackin' the deck, an' a few other tricks gamblers
have."</p>
<p>"Aw, I see. Wal, Jim has a right to holler when he ketches us,
same as we when we ketch him doin' the same."</p>
<p>That sally elicited a yell from Brann's comrades.</p>
<p>"Jest so he hollers only with his mouth," shouted Stagg.</p>
<p>"All right, I'll set in a few hands," said Jim,
good-naturedly. "Anyway, till I'm broke."</p>
<p>"Jim, your credit is good in this outfit," interposed Cash
Burridge. "An', anyway, you'll have a gunny sack full of money
before long."</p>
<p>Whereupon the rustlers, in high spirits, owing to being well
fed and flush with money, repaired to the shade of a pine in
front of Elam's cabin, and squatting round a blanket, emptied
their pockets of coin and bills. Jim joined them, choosing a seat
from which he could watch the cabins and the approach of
anyone.</p>
<p>Bantering ceased abruptly the instant gambling began. And the
cares of rustlers, if they had any, vanished as if by magic.</p>
<p>The game was draw-poker, the stakes any amount a player chose
to wager, provided he produced it. Jim knew he could hold his own
with these gamblers, but he preferred to lose the ill-gotten
gains Burridge had forced upon him as his share of their first
rustling deal together. So Jim played recklessly, making his
losses more than discount the ridiculously lucky cards he held at
times. His apparently casual glances at the cabin, however, were
not few and far between.</p>
<p>The Hatt boys came to watch the game, soon growing equally
absorbed with the gamblers; and it was noticeable to Jim that
they gravitated round the circle of players, wherever the gold
coin went. Old Elam came presently, and likewise fell to the
attraction of the game, but it seemed the playing itself rather
than the sums of money lost and won, that held charm for him.</p>
<p>Elam Hatt's house was one of the picturesque double-cabined
structures under one roof, with wide porch space between. The
logs had been peeled. They were old and brown, rotting in places;
the sloping roof of split shingles had a covering of green moss
and pine needles; the rude stone chimney, built on the outside of
the right-hand cabin, had been repaired many times with yellow
clay and red adobe mud. The porch ran all along the front of both
cabins, and one end was littered with saddles and packs. Deer and
elk antlers on the walls supported rifles and bridles. A bearskin
hide, not yet dried, hung nailed flesh side out, on the wall of
the left cabin. This was smaller than the other, evidently
consisting of only one room. The window, without glass or
shutter, opened toward Jim, who had been quick to see a face peer
from the darkness and draw back again.</p>
<p>When he caught sight of it again he knew at once that it
belonged to Rose Hatt and that she had espied him. She stood far
back in the gloom of the cabin, her face only a vague oval, but
with staring eyes like black holes.</p>
<p>"Elam, do you know draw-poker?" asked Jim, presently.</p>
<p>"Tolerable. I wisht I hed stake enough to set in this hyar
game. I'd bust somebody," replied old Hatt, to the amusement of
the gamesters.</p>
<p>"Play a few hands for me," said Jim, rising. "Change my luck,
maybe. I want a drink."</p>
<p>"Whiskey?"</p>
<p>"No. Water. Where'll I get it?"</p>
<p>"Thar inside the kitchen door at the end of the porch,"
replied Hatt, rising with alacrity to take Jim's place. "My girl
jest fetched some fresh from the spring. Snow water, an' thar's
none better."</p>
<p>As Jim neared the porch, Rose came out of the cabin where he
had seen her, and crossed to enter the other. She wore buckskin.
He caught the flash of brown bare legs and feet. Jim went down
the porch and entered the door mentioned by Hatt. As he expected,
he encountered Rose. Despite excitement manifest in her face, he
thought she looked clearer of eye and skin, somehow prettier.</p>
<p>"Howdy, Rose! You see I've come," he said.</p>
<p>"I saw you first thing," she replied.</p>
<p>"I want a drink, please."</p>
<p>She filled a dipper from a pail and handed it to him. Facing
her and standing in the door, Jim drank thirstily. It was good
water.</p>
<p>"Will it be all right if I talk to you?" asked Jim.</p>
<p>"Sure. 'Cept when Cedar's around."</p>
<p>"Where is he?"</p>
<p>"Reckon he's hidin' somewhere, watchin' you-all. So we can't
talk now. . . . But, oh! I've so much to tell you!"</p>
<p>"Yes? Tell me a little--quick," said Jim.</p>
<p>"Marvie's to fetch Hettie Ide--to meet me," whispered the
girl, fearfully, yet with eyes full of glad light. "Oh, she must
be an angel! He says she will give me a home--if I can ever get
away from here."</p>
<p>"Wal, now, that's fine," sympathized Jim, vibrating to this
news. <i>"Three</i> friends now--Marvie an' Hettie Ide an' me.
Lucky girl!"</p>
<p>"I can't thank God enough," she breathed from a full
breast.</p>
<p>"Keep on thankin', an' fightin'," said Jim, with ring of voice
and meaning smile. Then he set down the dipper on the bench and
backed out of the door, eyes still intent on Rose. She was
flushed of face now, eager, hopeful, yet still fearful.</p>
<p>"I will. They can't stop me now--unless they kill me," she
answered, resolutely, with a wonderful blaze in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Who're they, Rose?"</p>
<p>"Cedar, for one. I told you," she replied, haltingly. But
there seemed to be tremendous impelling power working on
her--greater, Jim sensed, than could come through him just
then.</p>
<p>"Tell me the other man."</p>
<p>"Oh, I daren't--I daren't," she faltered, losing courage.</p>
<p>"If you love Marvie--an' if <i>she</i> will stand by you--you
can dare," he shot at her, relentlessly.</p>
<p>She showed then a struggle over fear that had outlived
childish years.</p>
<p>"Rose, that other man is Clan Dillon?"</p>
<p>"Yes--yes," she whispered, in unutterable relief, as if she
had been spared betraying him. "Are--are you to be here
long?"</p>
<p>"Days, maybe weeks."</p>
<p>"Keep watch," begged the girl, finding courage. "Cedar will
drag me off in the woods--to meet Dillon. If he does--follow us,
for God's sake."</p>
<p>"I shore will, Rose. Don't lose your nerve."</p>
<p>"But be <i>careful,</i> Cedar's an Indian in the woods."</p>
<p>Jim Lacy leisurely turned, and with glance on the ground,
apparently idle and lax, he strolled back to the gamesters.</p>
<p>"How comes the luck, Elam?" he asked.</p>
<p>"My Gord! Won three hands straight runnin'," ejaculated Hatt.
"An' one a fat jack-pot."</p>
<p>"Wal, shore reckoned you'd change my luck. Play 'em for all
you're worth, Elam, an' if you break this outfit I'll divvy with
you."</p>
<p>"Ha! he's got no chanct on earth, Jim," said Cash. "Better set
back in before we break you."</p>
<p>Old Elam held his own, however, evidently to his immense
gratification. Jim watched for a while, much amused, until his
ever-roving glance fastened upon a newcomer to the scene.</p>
<p>A man had come out of the aspen thicket. He carried a rifle,
which he held by the barrel over his shoulder. His gait, his
build, betrayed him to Jim Lacy. This was Cedar Hatt.</p>
<p>Jim had been kneeling on one knee behind Elam, and now,
leisurely rising to his feet, he stood at ease. Upon nearer view
Cedar Hatt turned out to possess only the walk and the shape of
the Hatt family. He was darker than any of them, with beardless
face of clear brown tan, small glittering eyes set close, black
as coal, and of a strange intensity, sharp nose and sharp chin,
with a slit between for a mouth. He wore his hair long and it
curled dark from under an old slouch hat full of bullet holes.
His garb was greasy buckskin, from head to toe. There was a knife
in his belt, but no shells for the rifle.</p>
<p>Cedar Hatt stood across from the circle of gamblers, and
dropping the muzzle of his rifle upon his moccasined foot he
leaned on it, and gave his restless sloe-black eyes scope of all
present. If the players saw him they gave no outward show of it.
At length Cedar put the toe of his moccasin against his
father.</p>
<p>Elam looked up with a start.</p>
<p>"Hullo! You back, Cedar?"</p>
<p>The son made an almost imperceptible movement with his right
hand toward Lacy.</p>
<p>"Cedar, say howdy to Jim Lacy," went on Hatt, a little
hurriedly. Nevertheless, he was not greatly concerned. "Lacy,
this hyar's my son Cedar."</p>
<p>Jim nodded civilly, without speaking, and he received even
less in response. A look, like a streak of black lightning,
flashed over him from head to toe--then Cedar Hatt deigned him no
more attention.</p>
<p>It was a singular thing for Jim Lacy to meet men; and in a
case like this, when he knew before he had seen Cedar Hatt that
he was going to kill him, the incident seemed extraordinarily
potent and strange. If there was an instinct to act almost
involuntarily in such a meeting, there was also an intuitive
searching that followed. Lacy needed only the slightest glimpse
at Hatt's eyes to know that he had not yet learned of the killing
of Burt Stillwell. After that instant the meeting became only
ordinary for Jim, inasmuch as Hatt could never again be
formidable face to face. Jim knew him now. It was the unfamiliar
that men of Lacy's caliber always reckoned with.</p>
<p>The game progressed, with luck shifting from one player to
another, and manifestly what seemed a long, tedious, irritating
waste of time to Jim was only a fleeting of precious moments to
the gamblers.</p>
<p>Finally Cedar Hatt, without ever having uttered a word,
shouldered his rifle, and stalked away with the spring of a
deer-hunter in his stride. He went up the canyon to disappear
around the green bend.</p>
<p>Whereupon Lacy strolled away himself, into the golden shade of
the aspen thicket, and on through darker shade to the lichened
base of the cliff. He flung himself down here and leaned against
the wall. Above him the quivering aspen leaves fluttered with the
marvelous noiseless movement peculiar to them. All around in the
brush the lizards rustled. Nature was alive and full of treasure
for the watcher, the seeker. But Jim Lacy's eyes were focused
inward; his ears were attuned to a beating within. He had come
there into the obscurity and loneliness of the thicket to think,
to plan, to plot, to work out a course he could inevitably
follow. But how useless that was! The slightest accident or
incident might change the best of his plans. If he decided on a
definite thing his mind would be set. His task demanded more than
that; and it involved infinite patience and sacrifice, incredible
command of geniality and good-fellowship with these rustlers,
sight and sense that must grasp every little clue which might
lead to the success of his venture. All this when his spirit
revolted and his nature demanded quick, hard, fierce action!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After supper, which was served about sundown, on the porch
between the two cabins, Elam Hatt scraped his rude seat back and
arose.</p>
<p>"You-all who want to gamble air welcome, but I reckon some of
you will want to set in to a confab with me."</p>
<p>He went into his cabin, followed by Burridge and Lacy. The
large room was dark, except where breaks in the chinks between
the logs let in light. Hatt stirred the slumbering embers in the
huge yellow stone fireplace and put on chips of wood.</p>
<p>"Reckon they'll want the lamps, an' we don't need none," said
Elam.</p>
<p>The door opened to admit Cedar Hatt, who advanced with his
sliding silent step, to seat himself on a bench in the shadow
besides the stone chimney.</p>
<p>"Burridge, if thar's a lead weight on your chest, shove it
off," invited Elam, bending down to lift a fiery ember with which
to light his pipe.</p>
<p>"Are you open to a big deal?" queried the rustler,
bluntly.</p>
<p>"Always open to anythin'. But I'm careful not to change the
minds of ranchers about Elam Hatt," replied the backwoodsman,
shrewdly.</p>
<p>"Which means they think you do some two-bit brandin' of
mavericks, like any cowboy, but you never tackle a real rustlin'
job?"</p>
<p>"Reckon thet's the size of it, Cash."</p>
<p>"An' that's exactly why I'm goin' to spring this deal on you.
No one will ever lay it to you an' everyone will lay it to the
Pine Tree outfit. Savvy? The time's just ripe. The trap's set. We
can't do it half so well without you an' your sons. We don't know
the country. Otherwise you bet we wouldn't let you or anyone else
in on it."</p>
<p>"Sounds good. I'm listenin'."</p>
<p>"Tom Day an' Franklidge have throwed a big herd of stock
together. Some of it's workin' with Ben Ide's big herd, the last
of his stock, in what the sheepherders call Silver Meadows.
They're high an' won't be comin' down before the fall roundup.
That'll come anywhere along first of October. Now while them
cattle are high up we plan to drive them--<i>on up over the
Rim</i>--an' down into the Basin, where we could sell a hundred
times as many head, with never a question asked. I've already got
the buyer. To do the job right an' quick we need more riders, an'
particular some who know how to find fast travelin' through them
bad canyons up to the Rim. That's all. I leave it to you to call
the turn on that deal."</p>
<p>"How do you know Ide's stock air runnin' on Silver Meadows?
Thet's Day's range."</p>
<p>"I know because I saw them an' they used to be my cattle."</p>
<p>"You're calculatin' thet if Ide does rare, he'll lay it onto
the Pine Tree outfit?"</p>
<p>"Exactly. The deal is ready-made for us."</p>
<p>"How much stock thar now?"</p>
<p>"We can bunch three or four thousand head in half a day, an'
land them over the Rim in less'n two days."</p>
<p>"An' you've got a buyer?"</p>
<p>"Waitin' an' willin'. He's drivin' ten thousand head to
Maricopa. How easy to run in a few more thousand!"</p>
<p>"Looks too powerful easy to me," returned Hatt, as if sagging
under an overpowering weight.</p>
<p>"Easy an' safe. An' listen, Elam. . . . Twenty dollars a head.
In gold! One yellow old double-eagle for every steer!"</p>
<p>Elam Hatt paced the rough-hewn logs that constituted the floor
of his cabin. He seemed to find strength in their solidity. His
legs were the first part of him to weaken. His collapse came
suddenly, with a crash to the bench before the fire.</p>
<p>"Cedar, what'd'ye say?" he asked, in a hoarse low voice.</p>
<p>"Burridge, swear them steers air in Silver Meadows," said
Cedar Hatt, his moccasined feet coming down with padded thuds as
he leaped up and leaned out of the shadow.</p>
<p>"Sure I swear. Three days ago. An' the grass an' water are
fine. They'll work higher for several more days. . . . Ask Jim
Lacy here. Reckon you'll not be intimatin' he's a liar."</p>
<p>"Talk up, Jim Lacy, if you're a rustler," called the younger
Hatt.</p>
<p>"Wal, I was with Burridge. I saw the cattle," replied
Lacy.</p>
<p>Cedar Hatt glided into the light of the fire, to lean over his
father and strike out with lean dark hand, like the claw of an
eagle.</p>
<p>"Papa, with ten riders I can run them cattle over the Rim in
one day," he declared. How grotesque and striking the epithet he
gave his father! He seemed the epitome of lawlessness, of the
hardened rustler, yet acknowledged the endearing claim of
blood.</p>
<p>"Thet settles it, then," returned Elam Hatt, throwing up his
hands as one whose price had been met.</p>
<p>"Hold on! Thar ain't no Greaser herder in these brakes who'd
lead thet drive. An' I'm the only white man who kin."</p>
<p>"Wal, what's makin' you yap so? It's settled, ain't it, 'cept
the workin' out?"</p>
<p>"I want my pard, Burt Stillwell, in on this."</p>
<p>"Reckon I see no kick to thet. But it ain't my deal."</p>
<p>Cedar Hatt faced round with the swift, sinister action
peculiar to him.</p>
<p>"Anythin' ag'in' Stillwell?" he queried.</p>
<p>"Wal, not any more, Hatt," drawled Jim. "I shore had a little
grudge, but it's gone. When I saw Burt last, I shore had a
friendly feelin' for him."</p>
<p>"Burridge, you had no use for the Stillwells. How're you
standin' on this hyar deal I want?"</p>
<p>"Cedar, all I say is, sure--ring your pard Burt in--if you can
get him," returned Burridge, with something unnatural in his
tone. And it was noticeable that he stepped more into the
shadow.</p>
<p>"Papa," hissed Cedar Hatt, and that word inspired awe as well
as mirth, "I'm double-crossin' the Pine Tree outfit to make us
all rich on this big job."</p>
<p>"Air you drunk, son?" asked Hatt, slowly rising to his feet.
"How'n tarnation can you double-cross them--onless you mean
beatin' them to the deal?"</p>
<p>"Me an' Burt belong to the Pine Tree outfit."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c17" id="c17">SEVENTEEN</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>A week later to the day, about the middle of the afternoon,
Jim Lacy stood with Cash Burridge on the Mogollon Rim, facing
south over the magnificent wilderness of southern Arizona. The
black timber of the basin merged in the grassy parks and flats,
growing hazy in the distance, and all that wild lowland led to
the bleak colored desert ranges.</p>
<p>"My Gord! listen to that!" ejaculated Burridge, with red
sweaty face wrinkled ecstatically. "Grandest music on earth."</p>
<p>"Cash, they'll greet you in Hades some day with that music,"
drawled Jim.</p>
<p>"Bawlin' bulls an' whoopin' cowboys! I'll be glad to hear it,
providin' it don't come too soon," returned Burridge.</p>
<p>Yellow dust palls hung over the steep Maricopa trail, where it
jumped zigzag off the Rim and wound down into the green depths. A
mighty roar of trampling hoofs, and bellowing cattle, and
crashing brush, and whooping riders waved up from that hot slope.
It seemed an avalanche of sound now softening and again swelling,
wild and free, harmonious with the country which made it
possible. From the look of the trail, trampled and dug and
widened by thousands of hoofs, it appeared that a river of live
beasts had poured over the Rim.</p>
<p>"Lacy, it's all over but the fireworks," said Cash
exultantly.</p>
<p><i>"Quién sabe?</i> It might fetch some fireworks you're not
figurin' on," admonished his companion, moving over from his
heaving, foam-lashed horse to get in the shade of a pine.</p>
<p>"Not much. We're shakin' the dust of the brakes. Say, won't
Ben Ide an' Tom Day bite nails? Biggest drive I ever had a hand
in. An' all so easy! All like clockwork! All in a couple of days
despite that--yellow traitor, Cedar Hatt!"</p>
<p>"Shore we didn't need him," responded Lacy, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"Jim, I've seen some mad <i>hombres</i> in my time, but that
Cedar Hatt beats them all to hell," declared Burridge, aghast at
the memory.</p>
<p>"Shore he was mad. Didn't I warn you to keep your outfit from
givin' it away aboot Stillwell?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you did, an' I talked myself hoarse. But it couldn't be
kept. They <i>hated</i> Cedar, an' the minute somebody got two
drinks aboard he up an' blows that Burt Stillwell was dead. It
sure made a hydrophobia-coyote out of Cedar. But he didn't know
<i>who</i> shot Burt. When he spit questions at you, like a snake
with a hunch, why didn't you lie?"</p>
<p>"Wal, Cash, I reckon you don't savvy me."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you kill him, then?" went on Burridge, sharper of
tongue.</p>
<p>"I just aboot did," returned Lacy, reflectively. "But I saw he
didn't have the nerve to draw--so I waited."</p>
<p>"Ahuh! Waited? I get your hunch. Cedar knows somethin' you're
keen to find out. Bet it's that Pine Tree outfit."</p>
<p>"Cash, you're figurin' fair. But on the daid square
now--rememberin' the favors I've done you--cain't you tell me
somethin' about that outfit?"</p>
<p>"No more'n we all know, Jim."</p>
<p>"Shore you have some suspicion aboot who leads them?"</p>
<p>"Honest to Gawd, Lacy, I haven't even an idee!" returned
Burridge, with truth in look and voice. "It might be Judge
Franklidge himself."</p>
<p>"Holy Moses! Cash, that's a wild guess!" ejaculated Lacy.</p>
<p>"Sure. An' it's only a guess. But you can gamble all the coin
you're goin' to get <i>pronto</i> that the Pine Tree boss is not
hidin' in the brakes, like the rest of us rustlers. He's an
honest member of range society. Ha! Ha! Yes he is! . . . Jim,
there might be a combine of homesteaders an' ranchers in cahoots
with an outfit of great riders like Burt Stillwell an' Cedar
Hatt."</p>
<p>"Reckon I've thought of that."</p>
<p>"What's it to you, anyway, Jim?" queried Burridge,
curiously.</p>
<p>"Reckon I've got to put my brand on the boss of the Pine
Trees," said Lacy.</p>
<p>"Ah! Is <i>that</i> all? Hell! I thought you might have some
interest in him," retorted Cash sarcastically. "Jim, on the
square, if you hadn't done so much to straighten me out again,
I'd have suspicions about you."</p>
<p>"Wal, keep them in your haid."</p>
<p>Burridge laughed, and gathering up his bridle swung into the
saddle.</p>
<p>"Come on. I don't want the outfit to get far ahead. You'll be
hearin' the clink of gold before sundown."</p>
<p>"Not me, Cash."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I'm not goin' any farther with you."</p>
<p>The rustler exhibited profound concern and amaze.</p>
<p>"You're not goin' any farther--what--?"</p>
<p>"Say, Cash, are you out of your haid?" queried Jim,
testily.</p>
<p>"Sure I am, if you're not."</p>
<p>"Wal, I'm not, old-timer."</p>
<p>Burridge studied his companion for a long moment, his face
working. Regret began to erase the incredulity.</p>
<p>"What the hell are you goin' to do?"</p>
<p>"That's my concern now. I'm through."</p>
<p>"Through! . . . But, Jim--"</p>
<p>"Didn't I help you out of a bad hole--the worst you was ever
in?"</p>
<p>"You sure did, Jim. An' I--"</p>
<p>"Didn't I rustle cattle with you?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Didn't I come out in the open--so everybody on this range
will know I helped steal Ben Ide's cattle?"</p>
<p>"By Heaven! you did!" declared Burridge, with redder face.
"An' I hold that against you, Jim. I just can't figure why you
did that. We could sure have laid that onto the Pine Tree
outfit."</p>
<p>"Wal, neither Ben Ide nor any other honest rancher will know
<i>you</i> had the high hand in this big cattle steal. But my
name an' my hand in it will be known. I saw to that. They'll
think <i>I</i> am the boss of the Pine Tree outfit."</p>
<p>"I'm damned! . . . Jim Lacy, you're too deep for me. But I'm
gettin' a hunch. . . . How about your share in the divvy for this
deal?"</p>
<p>"You're welcome to it. Take it an' go out of this country. Try
bein' honest again. You might succeed next time. But don't ever
come back heah!"</p>
<p>"Why not, Jim?" queried Burridge, strong and hard.</p>
<p>"Because if you do I'll kill you," flashed Lacy, in a voice
that cut like a whip.</p>
<p>The ruddy heat left Burridge's face, and he began to nod his
head, slowly, with increasing motion, while his eyes fixed in a
startling comprehension.</p>
<p><i>"Jim</i>--<i>Lacy!"</i> he said, huskily.</p>
<p>"I reckon," replied Lacy, grimly, as he turned to his
horse.</p>
<p>"You been a pard to me, whatever your reasons," went on
Burridge, with feeling. "I don't care a damn what they were. . .
. I'll leave this country. Here's my hand on it. . . . Good-by
an' good luck!"</p>
<p>"Same to you, Cash," replied Jim, as they gripped hands.</p>
<p>Burridge wheeled his horse so violently that it reared and
plunged, and then slid to its haunches in the soft ground where
the trail broke over the Rim. Burridge hauled it up and used his
spurs. The animal snorted and took the first descent on a jump,
then steadied to a quick walk. At the first bend of the trail
into the timber the rustler looked back up to the Rim.</p>
<p>"I'll send my compliments to Cedar Hatt an' his boss in
hell!"</p>
<p>Lacy strode into the level shady forest, leading his horse. He
had prepared for this separation from Burridge, and had tied a
light pack behind his saddle. There was a spring in his step and
a light on his face. The deep forest land, beginning almost at
once to slope north from the Rim, seemed to receive and absorb
Lacy as a transformed man. How sweet and enchanting the silence,
the solitude! He listened for the last ebb of that tide of hoofs,
roaring down into the Basin. Gone! The air had cleared of the
dust, the heat, the din, the smell of a cattle drive.</p>
<p>It still wanted an hour to sunset, and the time was
approaching the most wonderful of all hours on the Mogollons.
Birds and game had roused from the midday Indian-summer heat; the
long black shadows of the trees were slanting down across the
open swales and dells, where the white grass furnished contrast
to the reds and purples and golds of the autumn leaves. The
tracks of man and horse showed dark through the thick covering of
gold and green that carpeted the ground.</p>
<p>Lacy descended winding ravines and aspen hollows until one
opened into the head of a canyon where the murmur of water
invited him to camp.</p>
<p>"Reckon you're plumb tired," he said to his horse, laying
swift hands on the ropes. "Wal, it was a day. But we're through
now--through with that kind of work. . . . An' I'm hatin' to
hobble you, old boy."</p>
<p>Jim kindled a little fire, and while he heated water in his
one pot he gathered ferns for bedding. The frost had seared the
long leaves, making them brittle and easy to break off. He piled
a great bundle in his blanket and carried it to the edge of an
aspen thicket, where, as was his habit, he made a bed under cover
of the foliage.</p>
<p>"I'll be cold as blazes along toward mawnin', but I cain't
keep a fire goin' . . . not with that Indian Cedar Hatt roamin'
the woods!"</p>
<p>The sordid atmosphere common to the rustler gang was lacking
here. Lacy did not realize it until he grew conscious of his
alacrity, of his zest with the old camp tasks, in the pause to
see and feel and hear and smell the forest which seemed now his
alone, in his habit of talking to himself.</p>
<p>"Wal, now, won't there be hell around the Ide ranch some of
these heah mawnin's, when riders come in with the news? Last of
the Ide cattle! . . . Jim Lacy takin' to rustlin'. . . . It will
be funny. I'd like to be hid an' heah Ben cuss. This'll be the
last straw. He'll get as many gun-toters as he can hire, an' set
out to land me in jail."</p>
<p>Jim seemed immensely pleased with the thought. The hard,
morose intentness of the past weeks did not inhibit his natural
geniality.</p>
<p>"Ben is shore goin' to get the shock of his life one of these
heah days," went on Jim. "The doggone old wild-hoss hunter! . . .
What's he goin' to say to me first off--an' then after? . . .
Lordy! . . . An' Hettie! . . . She'll call me a low-down yellow
faithless . . . Say, meetin' her will be about as funny as dyin'.
I can feel myself cavin' in right heah!"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jim Lacy, with his plans well in mind, had on the whole
journey across country from Elam Hatt's ranch to the head of the
Maricopa trail, taken careful account of the lay of the land.</p>
<p>It served him now. His intention was to return to Hatt's
ranch, if possible without encountering even a sheepherder. Hatt
had left his daughter Rose alone, unless the mysterious woman
consort of Henny or Tobe Hatt, of whom Jim had heard vaguely,
might be considered as company. Elam, of course, with his two
sons, could be expected to get back home from the cattle drive in
two days from the time Jim had left them, or even less. As for
Cedar Hatt, who had deserted Burridge and Elam after the
revelation of Stillwell's death, no doubt he had rushed to the
secret rendezvous of the Pine Tree men, wherever that was, there
to betray to them news of the impending drive of the Ide stock.
It was Cedar Hatt whom Lacy had greatest interest in, at the
present stage of the game; and Cedar was most likely to be found
at or near home.</p>
<p>There was reason, too, for Lacy to have an interview with Rose
Hatt, from whom he expected to force more about the man who
dominated her brother and whom she feared. Moreover, Rose was to
be considered on her own behalf.</p>
<p>Jim Lacy did not think it wise to go near Silver Meadows,
where the cattle had been collected for the great drive; and
therefore he made a wide detour, hoping to strike the trail he
and the rustler band had made coming from Hatt's ranch. But he
had to go into camp the second night of his journey without
having come to this trail. The forest was exceedingly rough, he
had only a general direction to go by, and often windfalls and
impassable brakes threw him off. On the third morning, however,
he struck the trail he was looking for, and he back-tracked it
all day. On the following day it failed on high ridges, on hard
ground, rocky flats, and pine-needle mats, over which Elam Hatt
had led the rustlers for the express purpose of hiding their
tracks.</p>
<p>Lacy wasted no time trying to recover them, though he believed
he could eventually have done so. Sure of his direction now, he
pressed on rapidly, and the next afternoon struck the deep canyon
east of the one in which Hatt lived. During his sojourn with the
Hatts, Lacy had hunted turkey and deer up and down these brakes,
with the sport of the hunt not at all his prime motive.</p>
<p>Jim took the precaution to ride well back from the Rim,
peeping over whenever opportunity offered from behind foliage or
rock covert. He did not really expect to see anyone, but that did
not influence his actions. Lacy was always cautious, watchful,
alert; and in this instance he might have been on a scent, so
instinctive was his progress along that Rim.</p>
<p>Presently, down in an open bend of the deep canyon Lacy caught
a glimpse of a rider. He was riding slowly up the trail, leaning
down from his saddle, evidently with eyes on the ground.</p>
<p>"Trackin' somethin'," muttered Jim. "Now I wonder who that is
an' what he's trackin'."</p>
<p>Lacy rode back away from the Rim, and urged his horse to a
lope, careful to avoid rocks and brush. There were places where
he had to go slowly, but in the main he covered a mile or more in
short order, then again approached the Rim.</p>
<p>This time he dismounted and cautiously stole to a
vantage-point, from which he could peer unseen. As luck would
have it, there was an open grassy meadow, narrow and long, just
beneath his position. The canyon was five hundred feet deep at
this point, green-walled, precipitous, and unsurmountable.</p>
<p>Lacy watched so long without seeing the rider that he believed
he had been too late to catch him crossing this open flat. But as
Lacy had about decided to hurry on again, the man emerged from
the lower end.</p>
<p>Horse and rider grew strangely familiar as they came nearer.
Lacy's iron nerves were not beyond a tiny burning thrill.</p>
<p>"Am I drunk or loco?" he muttered.</p>
<p>On the rider came, his horse at a trot, and still he bent over
to one side, studying tracks in the trail. He would have had an
ominous look to any experienced eye. This rider was not tracking
a lost horse or deer or turkey. He was a manhunter.</p>
<p><i>"Cedar Hatt!"</i> whispered Lacy, his head lowering with
the motion of a striking eagle. "Talk about luck! I'm shore
smothered with it. . . . Jim Lacy's luck! . . . But bad for you,
Cedar--you treacherous soul!"</p>
<p>Lacy watched the man with a strained, piercing gaze, as if it
were possible to divine his motive.</p>
<p>"This might be the trail Marvie Blaine rides when he comes to
meet Rose," soliloquized Jim, ponderingly. "Shore it is. She said
the brake east of where she lived."</p>
<p>Cedar Hatt rode on, directly under Jim's position, and once he
halted his horse, to lean far down from his saddle. How like an
Indian! Then he swung up again to peer ahead, as if calculating
on something. He made a dark wild figure, suiting his ragged
horse and the background of tangled brush and rugged wall. Then
he rode on, more slowly.</p>
<p>"By God!" burst out Lacy. "That <i>hombre</i> is sure trackin'
Marvie Blaine!"</p>
<p>Lacy crawled back from the Rim, then rose to run for his
horse. He would head off this rustler. Luckily, the lower part of
the canyon was miles below the locality where Rose was in the
habit of meeting young Blaine. Lacy had time to get ahead and
find a place where he could descend to the floor of the canyon.
Working still farther back from the Rim, he put his horse to a
gallop and made a hard fast ride for several miles. Then he
slowed down and headed for the Rim again. No break in sight where
he might descend! The wall grew more precipitous and higher. Lacy
rode on, close to the Rim now, risking detection in his search
for a descent. But he had no concern that Cedar Hatt might be the
one to espy him.</p>
<p>At length Lacy came upon an interesting canyon, a narrow crack
which ran off into the woods. He rode back to where it headed in
one of the thickest ravines, so common to the country. He
descended as far as possible, then dismounting, he tied his horse
and hurried on. This gorge deepened into a split between toppling
walls, so rough that there was not even a deer trail. But Lacy,
sparing no effort, traversed it, to reach the main canyon hot and
bruised and out of breath.</p>
<p>Under cover of the oak thicket that lined the slope from the
wall he rested a few moments, listening like a pursued deer. Only
the distant murmur of a stream, a dreamy hum, and the moan of
wind up on the timbered ruins came to his ears.</p>
<p>"Reckon I'll slip down to the trail an' hold Cedar up,"
soliloquized Jim. "But I'd shore like to know what he's
aboot."</p>
<p>The east side of the canyon was a gentle slope, covered with
white grass, brown ferns, and low pines and oaks, affording
perfect cover for anyone hiding. Lacy worked gradually down
toward the level of the canyon. He did not snap twigs, or scrape
brush, or make any sound. At each little opening he peered out
before advancing. Often he stopped to listen. Once an elk
bugled--wonderful piercing note of the wild.</p>
<p>It was through this extreme caution and the eye of a woodsman
that Lacy came upon Marvie Blaine and Rose Hatt.</p>
<p>They were locked in each other's arms, lost in the enchantment
of their dream. But they had chosen a secluded nook, halfway up
the grassy pine-dotted slope, from which they could see, by
peering under the low-spreading branches, both up and down the
trail. At this moment, however, they would not have become aware
of the approach of an army.</p>
<p>Lacy seemed struck to the heart by their rapture and the
poignant pang that rent his own breast. He understood. He had
lived that. He knew the sweetness and glory of love. Lacy sank to
his knees, feeling that he had no right to interrupt their sacred
hour. Marvie bent over Rose, whose head lay back upon his breast,
with her face upturned to his, eyes closed, heavy-lidded, rapt
and dreamy. If they were whispering Lacy would not hear, though
he was close. But he doubted that they were whispering. Both
bliss and tragedy seemed to hover over these youthful lovers.</p>
<p>Suddenly Lacy heard a sound that cruelly disrupted both the
pain and the joy he felt. In a flash he found his equilibrium.
What was that sound? It had been faint, and therefore hard to
locate. It could have come from either near or far. He listened,
while his eyes roved everywhere. Marvie was deaf to sounds. No
doubt there was a beautiful bell ringing in his soul. Rose lay
entranced.</p>
<p>Again Jim heard a sound, which he calculated to be a swish
from the tail of a horse. Of course Marvie and Rose had their
horses tethered somewhere near. But the first noise had not been
like the second. It was not a thud of hoof, nor a step of foot.
It seemed to have been a slippery gliding sound, as of a soft
substance in contact with one rough and hard. All at once an idea
flashed to Jim--buckskin over rock! Cedar Hatt always wore
buckskin. Close at hand there were corners of cliff, ledges, huge
slabs of rock. The instant that thought stood clear in Lacy's
mind he grew stiff, intense in the grasp of a sensation for which
he never found an adequate name. It mounted almost to a power of
divination. It always brought the icy steadiness to his
nerves.</p>
<p>Then from the dark shadow of pines behind Marvie a lithe
figure glided. Silently Jim Lacy drew his gun. The situation was
clarified, and a dread of something he could not see or control
faded away.</p>
<p>Marvie never looked up from the beloved face until Cedar Hatt
halted. It was clear to Jim that Cedar's sudden violent check
came from the surprise of seeing Rose in Marvie's arms.</p>
<p>Marvie likewise started, so suddenly and rudely that Rose
rolled off his shoulder into the grass. She screamed. She swayed
up to her knees, and with hands out she backed until the pine
tree stopped her.</p>
<p>"So hyar's why you run off from me to-day?" he shouted,
fiercely. The muscles of his neck swelled, his lean jaw
protruded.</p>
<p>"Don't--don't hurt me--Cedar!" cried Rose in terror.</p>
<p>"I'll beat you half to death. So hyar's why you played sick
to-day an' then run off. You lyin' hussy! Answer me!"</p>
<p>"Yes--yes, Cedar. I--I did," replied Rose, sagging back
against the tree. Her open hands fell to her sides. A paralysis
of surprise began to leave her.</p>
<p>"This hyar ain't no accident?" he demanded, with a forceful
gesture toward the stricken Marvie.</p>
<p>"No. I come--on purpose."</p>
<p>"How long's it b'en goin' on?"</p>
<p>"Weeks. I--I've come eight times."</p>
<p>"Who's this hyar young buck?"</p>
<p>"I'll never tell," flashed Rose.</p>
<p>Marvie stumbled to his feet and stepped forward, livid of
face, but resolute.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you," he said.</p>
<p>"Don't--don't!" cried Rose. "Never tell him!"</p>
<p>"Who'n hell air you?" queried Cedar, in amaze, as if the
factor of Marvie's participation in this treachery of Rose's had
just dawned upon him.</p>
<p>"I'm Marvie Blaine," answered the lad.</p>
<p>"Blaine! Huh! thet means nothin' to me."</p>
<p>"I live with Ben Ide. We're related."</p>
<p>"Ben Ide! . . . Oho! You belong to them rich Ide folks, huh,
as wouldn't wipe their feet on sich as us Hatts? Wal, damn your
white skin, what you doin' hyar with my sister?"</p>
<p>"I--I love her," answered Marvie, manfully.</p>
<p>Cedar knocked him down.</p>
<p>"I'll kick your guts out," he snarled.</p>
<p>Marvie rolled out of reach, leaped to his feet, and came back,
with fight struggling to master his consternation and distress
for Rose.</p>
<p>"I seen you huggin' an' kissin' Rose. An' you got nerve to say
you love her. Playin' with my sister, huh? An' you belong to them
Ides!"</p>
<p>"Cedar, it's not--what you think," burst out Rose, with the
scarlet dyeing her face.</p>
<p>"Git out, you lyin' little devil. If you'll lie about one
thing you'll lie about another. . . . All the time you been
meetin' this young buck. Layin' hyar in his arms, huh?"</p>
<p>"You skunk!" retorted Rose, passionately. "He loves me honest.
. . . You're too low-down to understand what that means."</p>
<p>"Didn't I ketch you layin' in his arms?" demanded Cedar,
harshly, yet with a hint of wonder in his query.</p>
<p>"Yes, you did. An' you might have ketched me there often,"
cried the girl.</p>
<p>"Ed Richardson will kill you fer this!" hissed Cedar.</p>
<p>"Let him kill an' be damned!" returned Rose, with an equal
passion. "I don't belong to him. I hate him. Did he ever talk
honest love to me? Bah! But Marvie Blaine did. An' he's made a
woman out of me."</p>
<p>"Hatt, I've asked--Rose to marry--me," interposed Marvie,
beside himself with emotion.</p>
<p>"Yes, an' Miss Ide is goin' to give me a decent home till I'm
old enough," added Rose.</p>
<p>"Oho! Double-crossin' Ed an' all of us, hey? You black-eyed
cat! . . . Git your hoss, an' soon as I take the hide off this
kid lover of yours, we'll--"</p>
<p>"Cedar Hatt, you'll have to pack me dead--if you take me one
single step. . . . You'll never drag me alive to your Pine
Tree--"</p>
<p>"Shut up!" interrupted Cedar, and he struck her down.</p>
<p>Marvie, with furious imprecation, wildly swinging his arms,
rushed at Hatt, only to be sent staggering against the tree.</p>
<p>"I'll blow your insides out!" yelled Cedar, reaching for his
gun.</p>
<p>But before he could draw, Marvie closed with him, and as Hatt
dragged the gun out they began a swift struggle for possession of
it. Here Jim bounded out of his covert and down the slope, his
gun half leveled. Neither of the contestants was aware of his
presence, but Rose saw him, and she shrieked.</p>
<p>Jim tried to get a bead on Cedar. But he had to be sure of his
aim. He did not want to risk injuring Marvie. As they whirled and
wrestled, Cedar pulled his arm over his head, his hand clutching
the gun. Marvie clung desperately to that arm.</p>
<p>Jim took a snap shot at Cedar's gun hand. Missed! He snapped
another and the bullet almost tore Cedar's hand off. The gun went
flying, while Cedar, backing away from Marvie, cursing hideously,
suddenly froze stiff at sight of Jim.</p>
<p>Marvie had not yet seen his savior. No doubt he thought the
shots had been fired accidentally in the struggle, wounding
Cedar. Quick as a flash he snatched up Cedar's gun and, leveling
it with both hands, he worked the trigger. Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>Cedar Hatt clutched at his breast. An awful blank surprise
rendered his expression once more human. With gasps his mouth
opened to emit blood. Then he reeled and fell at Marvie's
feet.</p>
<p>Marvie began to sag, changing his crouching position. The
smoking gun dropped from his limp hands. Rose, on her knees, with
a red stain on her lips, rocked to and fro, mute with terror.</p>
<p>"Wal, Marvie, that wasn't so bad for a youngster," said Jim,
stepping forward. "I was just about to plug him myself."</p>
<p>As if a giant arm was grinding him around the lad turned.</p>
<p><i>"Who're</i>--<i>you?"</i> he whispered, wildly, almost
maudlinly.</p>
<p>"Reckon I'm your old pard, Nevada, of Forlorn River days,"
replied Jim, and then he grasped Marvie as he collapsed. He
embraced him and half carried him toward the trees, where Rose
now clung, trying to get to her feet. "Brace up, boy. It's all
over. There. . . . An' you, Rose, buck up. Why, you're both
showin' yellow after as game a fight as two kids ever made! . . .
That's right. Let him lean against you. Wal, wal!"</p>
<p>Marvie, with eyes starting, cried out: "O my God--it's
you--<i>Nevada!"</i></p>
<p>"Shore is, boy, an' glad to meet you again."</p>
<p>"Mister Lacy--do--you--know Marvie?" faltered Rose.</p>
<p>"Wal, I should smile. Me an' Marvie are old pards."</p>
<p>Marvie suddenly seemed to revert to a consciousness that
recalled Cedar Hatt. He stared in terror at the prone
rustler.</p>
<p>"Nevada, you--you shot him," he said, huskily.</p>
<p>"Me? Nope. I only shot his hand off. You see, you was dancin'
around so I couldn't bore him."</p>
<p>"He--he's <i>dead?"</i></p>
<p>"Wal, I reckon so. Has that sort of limp look," replied Jim.
"But I'll make shore." And Jim rose from his kneeling posture to
walk over to Hatt. "Daid as a door nail! Marvie, he was roarin' a
minute ago aboot blowin' out your insides. An', lo!--there he
lays with his own insides blowed out. His own gun! Funny aboot
things. . . . Don't look so sick. Wasn't he tryin' to kill you?
Wouldn't he have murdered Rose--or worse?"</p>
<p>Marvie sat up, pallid and wet, with his lower lip quivering
and his eyes losing their fixed horror.</p>
<p>"Nevada! You were here--somewhere?"</p>
<p>"Shore. I was watchin' you an' Rose make love when Cedar
sneaked up. Reckon I ought to have shot him <i>pronto,</i> but I
wanted to heah what he'd say."</p>
<p>"Marvie, it's turrible," interposed Rose. "My own brother! But
I don't care. I'm glad. He was a devil. . . . Did he hurt you?
Oh, there's blood on your hands!"</p>
<p>"I'm not hurt. It come off the gun. I felt it--all wet an'
sliddery."</p>
<p>Jim studied these two brave young people and thrilled to his
heart. What had guided his steps on this eventful day?</p>
<p>"Rose, I reckon you can never be scared by Cedar again," he
said.</p>
<p>"No, Mister Lacy. I'm free--saved," replied the girl, in
agitation.</p>
<p><i>"Lacy?"</i> cried Marvie, starting up incredulously. "But
you're Nevada!"</p>
<p>"Son, the Nevada you knew was Jim Lacy."</p>
<p>"My Heaven! what will Ben say? . . . An' Hettie," exclaimed
Marvie, overcome.</p>
<p>"Reckon they'll say a lot--when they know. But promise me you
won't give me away."</p>
<p>"Aw, Nevada, if you only knew how Ben--"</p>
<p>"Marvie, I'm not askin' you to keep it secret forever,"
interrupted Jim hastily. "But for a little while. Promise, old
pard."</p>
<p>"I--will," replied Marvie, choking.</p>
<p>"An' you, too, Rose?"</p>
<p>"I can keep secrets. An' I mustn't let slip that you're
Marvie's old pard Nevada?"</p>
<p>"Shore. An' now, Rose, let's get this confab over. I reckon my
hunch is correct. But I need to know more."</p>
<p>"I'll tell anything," she replied, under her breath.</p>
<p>"You told me Dillon is haid of this Pine Tree outfit?" queried
Nevada, bending down to the agitated face.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," replied Rose. "Some of his men called him
Campbell. But he told Cedar his real name was Ed Richardson. He's
from New Mexico. He figgered in the Lincoln County war an' was
close to Billy the Kid. He fetched rustlers here with him. An' he
got hold of Cedar, an' Burt Stillwell, an' Stewart, an' other
Arizona riders whose names I never heard."</p>
<p>"Rose, how'd you happen on this?" asked Nevada, seriously.</p>
<p>"Cedar fetched Clan Dillon to our ranch, an' he tried to make
up to me," went on Rose. "I liked him first off. But I soon saw
what he was up to an' I had no use for him. Wal, one day Cedar
threw me on a horse an' rode me off to a cabin over here in Piñon
Brake. Dillon was there. He tried makin' more love to me. But I
bit an' kicked an' clawed him. Then he manhandled me bad, with
Cedar grinnin' by. He'd have ruined me, too, but the men they was
expectin' rode up an' I got thrown in the loft. Some of them were
drunk. They all had money. An' they gambled an' stayed up all
night. In the mornin' they had a powwow. Then Cedar fetched me
back home an' swore he'd kill me if I squealed."</p>
<p>"Clan Dillon, then, is Ed Richardson--haid of this Pine Tree
outfit," said Nevada, "an' Ben Ide's foreman."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," replied Rose, bravely, with lips that
trembled.</p>
<p>"Good Lord!" ejaculated Marvie. "Ben swears by Dillon. He's
gone against Raidy, his oldest hand. . . . Gee! I wouldn't want
to be in Dillon's boots when Ben finds out!"</p>
<p>"Wal, Marvie, it's likely that Dillon's boots will be stickin'
out straight when Ben heahs the truth. . . . Rose, is there any
particular reason why you'd like to go back home again? Clothes
or anythin' you care for?"</p>
<p>"All the duds I own are on my back," replied Rose, ruefully.
"Cedar burned my pretty dance dress--that I bought to look nice
for Marvie. My pony's all I have. An' he's here."</p>
<p>"Marvie, get your horse an' put Rose on hers an' leave heah
<i>pronto</i> for the Ide ranch. Look sharp an' don't run into
any riders. When you reach home turn Rose over to Hettie, an'
both of you keep your mouth shut."</p>
<p>His compelling force wrung mute promises from both Marvie and
the girl.</p>
<p>"My horse is on top, an' I cain't get him down heah. Rustle
now."</p>
<p>Marvie started to lead Rose away, when he espied Cedar Hatt's
gun lying on the brown pine needles.</p>
<p>"Nevada--can I take it?" he queried, haltingly.</p>
<p>"What? Oh, Cedar's gun? Shore you take it."</p>
<p>The girl turned with lips parted. "Mister Jim--Nevada--we'll
see you again?"</p>
<p>"I reckon. Remember, I trust you to keep mum. Look sharp now,
an' hurry along."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nevada did not linger to watch them find and mount their
horses; however, as he started up the slope he heard them, and
felt that now all would be well with them. He climbed as one with
wings. How strange that the rough gully presented no obstacles!
Reaching his horse, he tightened the cinches, leaped astride, and
rode up to the level, where he faced north with a grim smile.</p>
<p>The afternoon had not far advanced. At a steady lope he
covered the miles of forested ridge, downhill and easy going
until he descended into the brakes. Here his horse toiled for an
hour, at last to crash out into the trail. One glance at the bare
ground showed him that Marvie and Rose had not yet come so far.
He preferred to reach the Ide ranch before they did. His mind
clamped round one thing and set there, cold and sure.</p>
<p>Five miles of travel, now slow, now swift, and then a hard
climb took Nevada out of the brakes into the beautiful stately
forest, where the pines thinned and straggled to the desert sage.
How sweet the fragrance! He had once viewed from afar the Ide
ranch, with its slope of sage and cedar leading up to the black
benches.</p>
<p>The trail grew broad and sandy, so that his speeding horse
thudded almost noiselessly on. Clumps of spruce and low branches
of pines obscured the bends.</p>
<p>Nevada rode around an abrupt green curve almost to run down a
horse coming toward him. He pulled his mount to a sliding halt.
He heard a cry. The rider was a woman. Hettie Ide!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c18" id="c18">EIGHTEEN</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>"Hettie," said Ben Ide as he stood on the porch and spread his
arms to the glorious beauty and color of the Arizona landscape,
"I once thought Forlorn River in the fall was pretty close to
heaven. But Cedar Springs Ranch has it beaten a mile."</p>
<p>"Ben Ide! You going back on Forlorn River!" exclaimed Hettie,
in surprise.</p>
<p>"Well, hasn't it? Look around. What do you think,
yourself?"</p>
<p>"Long ago, before this wonderful autumn came, I was faithless
to California," murmured Hettie, regretfully.</p>
<p>"Hettie, not faithless. I don't love the old home country any
the less because I've learned to love this more. Lord knows I've
reason to hate Arizona. But I can't. It grows on me. Here it's
way in September. Frost an' ice every mornin'. Indian summer
days. Look at the sage. It's purple. Look at the foothills.
Anyone would think they were painted. Look at the patches of gold
an' scarlet back up in the woods."</p>
<p>"It's very beautiful," replied Hettie, more dreamily.</p>
<p>"Sister, we mustn't forget that mother is to be taken to San
Diego for the winter months."</p>
<p>"I've not forgotten, Ben. But there's no hurry. This weather
is perfect. Mr. Day claims it'll last till Christmas."</p>
<p>"Well, if it does, I could ask no more," said Ben. "Then I'll
send mother with you an' Ina an' the kid to San Diego till
spring. But I'll stay on here. I'd be afraid to leave."</p>
<p>"It wouldn't be wise, Ben. Things have grown from bad to
worse. I fear you are in for more shocks."</p>
<p>"Tom Day says they must grow worse before they get better.
Heigho! . . . Well, I'm not lettin' disappointment sour me,
anyhow."</p>
<p>"Disappointment? You mean--about ranching in Arizona?"</p>
<p>"Between you an' me, Hettie, I wasn't thinkin' of cattle at
all," replied Ben, sadly.</p>
<p>Hettie suffered a contraction of her heart. If Ben knew what
she knew! She prayed that he never would. And she gave no sign
that she divined the undercurrent of his words.</p>
<p>Marvie Blaine sat on the porch step, morosely cleaning his
rifle, which evidently he had used that day. The lad had grown
taller, thinner, more of a man these last few weeks.</p>
<p>"Marv, you don't ride far away when you hunt, do you?" queried
Ben.</p>
<p>"Lots of turkey an' deer right in our back yard," answered
Marvie, evasively.</p>
<p>"Humph! Much good that does you. I've yet to eat the venison
you killed."</p>
<p>"Ben, I've killed some turkeys," insisted Marvie, stoutly.
"An' to-day I had a shot at a buck."</p>
<p>"Seems to me you take a lot of time off," went on Ben, "an'
I'm supposed to pay you a cowboy's salary."</p>
<p>"I do the work given me. Dillon sure slights me on every job
he can."</p>
<p>"Weren't you pretty smart-alec?" asked Ben.</p>
<p>"I wasn't until he got mean."</p>
<p>"An' when was that? Are you sure you don't imagine things?
Dillon is the kindest of foremen."</p>
<p>Marvie looked up deliberately and fastened unfathomable eyes
upon this friend of his boyhood.</p>
<p>"Dillon used to like me. But he changed after the cowboys told
him how I'd made up to little Rose Hatt at the dance in
Winthrop."</p>
<p>"Rose Hatt! That child of Elam Hatt's? I saw her once. What on
earth could it be to Dillon if you did flirt with Rose? As a
matter of fact, he was merely worried about you. Rose was no girl
for you to get friendly with."</p>
<p>"Say, did Dillon tell you that?" queried Marvie, flushing.</p>
<p>"Yes. An' he advised me to put a stop to it. Said you might
get in trouble."</p>
<p>Marvie jumped up as if he had been stung by a hornet.</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha!" he burst out, striding away with his head back. "Ha!
Ha! . . . Ha! Ha! Ha!"</p>
<p>He kept it up until he went out of sight around the house.</p>
<p>"Well, I'll be doggoned," ejaculated Ben, gazing at Hettie for
confirmation of his fears. "Was that boy givin' me the
horse-laugh?"</p>
<p>"He was surely giving you some kind of a laugh," replied
Hettie, striving to hide her own amusement.</p>
<p>"Hettie, am I growin' old, thick-headed, absent-minded?"
inquired Ben, wistfully.</p>
<p>"No, Ben," returned his sister, dropping her head. "You've
only the worry of the ranch on your mind."</p>
<p>"By George it is a worry," he sighed. "But, old girl, you've
not been so bright and happy as you were here at first. Neither
is Ina. I'm afraid I've done bad by both of you."</p>
<p>"Ben, it will all come right," spoke up Hettie, forcing a
smile. "We must take our medicine. It's Arizona medicine, which
your friend, Tom Day, says is powerful strong."</p>
<p>"Hettie, do you still think of--of--<i>him?"</i> asked Ben, in
lower tone.</p>
<p>"Always," she replied, quaking inwardly. If only she had the
courage and the wit to keep her secret hidden!</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I've given up hope," went on Ben, somberly. "An'
it's taken the sap out of me. Don't tell Ina. But I'm fallin'
into the same rut as I was in last spring, over home on Tule
Lake."</p>
<p>"Given up hope of what?" murmured Hettie.</p>
<p>"Of ever findin' Nevada," he replied, simply, as if the name
was not one he never mentioned. "That's why I came to Arizona.
Once at Forlorn River, when I asked Nevada what he'd do if
anythin' separated us, he said he'd go to Arizona an' take to
hard ridin'. I never forgot. . . . Well, I reckon every cowboy on
these ranges has hit me for a job. But sure not one of them was
Nevada, nor had they ever heard of him. I reckon he's dead. Don't
you ever think that, Hettie?"</p>
<p>"Yes. . . . Dead to us, surely," she returned, with dry
lips.</p>
<p>"How could Nevada be dead to us if he were alive?" queried
Ben, sharply. Then he lifted his head to some interruption of his
thought. "I hear a horse . . . comin' lickety cut! Hello! it's
Dillon! . . . Damn the luck! There's somethin' up!"</p>
<p>Hettie sustained a sharp quickening of her pulse. A horse and
rider bobbed up over the bench. At the moment Ina came out of the
house, to begin some speech to Ben, which did not materialize.
Ben strode off the porch to meet Dillon, who rode up like a
whirlwind, scattering gravel all over the porch; and he leaped
out of the saddle with the lithe grace of one to whom such action
was a habit.</p>
<p>"Mornin', boss," he said and tipped his sombrero to Hettie and
Ina. "You're late. So I rode up."</p>
<p>"Bad news?" asked Ben.</p>
<p>"No, it ain't bad, but it's disturbin'. Cowboy just in from
Tom Day's range. Name's Laskin. He rode a hoss to death gettin'
here. I gave him another hoss, an' soon as he'd swallowed some
drink an' grub he rode off for Franklidge's ranch."</p>
<p>"Yes. Well, what was he ridin' so hard for?" queried Ben, as
if prepared.</p>
<p>"Yesterday he was in camp near Silver Meadows," went on
Dillon. "Another rider with him--whose name I didn't get. Some
men rode down on them. Laskin said they wasn't drunk. Just keyed
up over a big deal. They made no bones about the deal--at least
their leader didn't. An' he was no other than Jim Lacy."</p>
<p>"Jim Lacy bobbed up again!" ejaculated Ben, with irritation.
"Go on, Dillon."</p>
<p>"Lacy said he was goin' to rustle the stock at Silver Meadows
an' sent you his compliments."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm a--!" broke out Ben, choking down the last of his
utterance.</p>
<p>"Pretty nervy, wasn't it?" asked Dillon. He appeared excited,
which was a striking exception to his usual genial and
imperturbable mood. Hettie gazed spell-bound at him.</p>
<p>"Nervy? Yes, if it's true," retorted Ben. "But I don't believe
it."</p>
<p>"It's as straight as shootin', boss," rejoined Dillon. "I
happen to know the rider who tipped us off."</p>
<p>"But Jim Lacy or anybody else would be a fool to tell such a
plan, before pullin' it off," said Ben, incredulously.</p>
<p>"Reckon that seems so," replied the foreman, smoothly. "But
sometimes these desperadoes like Lacy do queer things. It's not
braggin'. Such men don't brag. It's just sort of a cool defiance
of law--an' honest ranchin'. . . . Well, Lacy has twenty-four
hours' start. There was a big bunch of cattle at Silver, so
Laskin said. The last of your stock, an' some of Day's an'
Franklidge's. We were figgerin' on a big roundup <i>pronto.</i>
But we're too late, boss."</p>
<p>"Too late! Why, man, if it <i>is</i> true, we can stop that
drive before it gets down to the road," declared Ben.</p>
<p>"Stop nothin'. Lacy's outfit won't drive this way. They'll
drive up over the Rim, an' I'll gamble there's a bunch of five
thousand head on the way now."</p>
<p>Ben sat down as if suddenly weighted.</p>
<p>"Boss, I'm sure kickin' myself for not figgerin' that very
deal," went on Dillon, and his smile was something to conjure
with. Hettie caught it, but Ben saw nothing. "You see, the cattle
were workin' high up. An' grass an' water's so good at Silver
that they bunched thick. Laskin swears it's only a half day's
drive up the canyon which opens into Silver. . . . An' there you
are."</p>
<p>A hoarse intolerant resentment rang in Dillon's voice. To Ben
Ide he must have seemed a masterful and experienced foreman,
angry at this coup of the latest recruit to Arizona rustlers.</p>
<p>"If it's true I'll--I'll run down this Jim Lacy an' jail him.
I don't care what it costs," declared Ben. "But I reckon we're
gettin' all r'iled up over cowboy guessin'."</p>
<p>"Give me a couple of days off, boss?" asked Dillon, in strange
eagerness. "I'll find out."</p>
<p>"You want to ride off alone?" queried Ben.</p>
<p>"Sure. That's the best way."</p>
<p>"No. Some of the rustlers will plug you, an' then I
<i>would</i> be out of luck," replied Ben, decisively.</p>
<p>"But I want to go," declared Dillon, with the blood rising
under the tan of his handsome face.</p>
<p>"I appreciate the risk you'd take for me, Dillon. But, no, I'm
gjvin' you orders to take Raidy with six cowboys an' go to Silver
Meadows. Hurry back to report. Then we'll see."</p>
<p>Dillon had difficulty in repressing some kind of agitation
that did not owe its source to respect and regard for Ben Ide.
What an intent, almost derisive glance he gave Ben! Then without
another word he mounted and rode furiously down toward the
corrals.</p>
<p>"Girls, did you hear all he had to say?" asked Ben, appealing
for sympathy.</p>
<p>"We couldn't very well help it," replied Ina, putting a hand
on Ben's shoulder. "Dear, I--I haven't confidence in this man
Dillon."</p>
<p>"Huh! Nor in me, either," retorted Ben, shaking her hand
off.</p>
<p>That action hurt Ina's sensitive feelings and she drew away
haughtily.</p>
<p>"Very well, Ben Ide," she declared. "But when the crash comes,
don't you look to <i>me</i> for sympathy."</p>
<p>With that she went back into the house. Ben gazed helplessly
up at his sister.</p>
<p>"There! Can you beat that? My own wife gone against me!"</p>
<p>Hettie subdued her own impatience, not without effort, and
then set herself the task of meeting her brother's morbid
irritation, and by agreeing with him and bidding him hope on and
fight on forever, if need be, she made some little impression
upon his mood.</p>
<p>Then Marvie appeared again, this time black in the face. Alas
for Hettie! Her heart sank.</p>
<p>"Ben Ide, I've a bone to pick with you," he burst out.</p>
<p>"Pick away, you young rooster," returned Ben, wearily; but he
was interested. Marvie had never before bearded the lion in his
den.</p>
<p>"Did Dillon tell you a cowboy named Laskin rode in with news
about a cattle drive?"</p>
<p>"Sure he did."</p>
<p>"Ha! That's what he told Raidy. He's a damn liar!"</p>
<p>"Marvie, take care! You're no longer a kid. Would you say that
to Dillon's face?"</p>
<p>"Would I? Huh! I did an' I cussed him good," rejoined Marvie,
hotly.</p>
<p>"Why did you? Marv, I'm losin' patience."</p>
<p>"An, I'm losin' patience with you, Ben Ide. Listen. I saw that
cowboy. He wasn't no rider named Laskin. He was Cedar Hatt!"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Cedar Hatt, I tell you. I <i>know</i> him."</p>
<p>"Marvie, you're not only loco, but you're ravin' sore at
Dillon. You'll go too far. Take care."</p>
<p>"Care, hell!" shouted Marvie, beside himself with rage. "It's
you who's loco."</p>
<p>"Marvie Blaine, you're fired," replied Ben, curtly. "You can't
ride for me any more."</p>
<p>Marvie underwent a sudden disastrous change of mood.</p>
<p>"Fired?" he said, poignantly.</p>
<p>"Yes, fired. Now get out of my house an' go over to Hettie's
till I can decide what to do with you."</p>
<p>"Aw--Ben!" gasped Marvie.</p>
<p>"Don't aw--Ben me," said Ben, furiously. "Get out of here
now--you round-eyed, freckle-faced four-flush of a cowboy!"</p>
<p>Marvie started as if he had been lashed.</p>
<p>"Ben Ide, you'll be sorry for that," he declared, solemnly,
and stamped away.</p>
<p>Ben stared at the erect retreating figure of the lad.</p>
<p>"Marvie, too!" he said, huskily.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hettie felt something of a sneak herself as she stole away,
back to her own cabin and the seclusion of her room. Was she not
betraying Ben by withholding facts she alone knew? Yet how
impossible to crush him utterly! Jim Lacy was Nevada! She would
never have the courage to tell him.</p>
<p>As for herself, the last hope had fled, the last doubt, the
last shred of stubborn faith. Nevada was a rustler. He had fallen
so low that he could steal from the friend who had once succored
him. The thing was so base that Hettie writhed under the shame of
her seemingly indestructible love for this impostor Nevada--this
fugitive horseman who had won her under another guise--this Jim
Lacy, killer and thief. But though everything else seemed dead,
hope, faith, interest in life, will to go on fighting, she knew
her love survived. It was the very pulse of her heart.</p>
<p>A long hour she lay there on her bed, until collapse and tears
came to her relief. And when she again rose to face herself in
the mirror she shrank aghast. But there was her mother to live
for, and poor blind Ben, who had loved this traitor Nevada, even
as she.</p>
<p>Two days went by, with the Ide households under considerable
strain of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Raidy and Dillon, with their riders, returned about noon of
the third day. The news reached Hettie while she was in the
kitchen, with her sleeves rolled up and flour to her elbows, but
she did not lose time on account of that.</p>
<p>Ben was somber, nervous, silent, and he paced the living-room,
oblivious to the importunities of little Blaine, who toddled here
and there, as if he were playing a game.</p>
<p>Presently Raidy entered the open door, sombrero in hand, dusty
and unshaven.</p>
<p>"Howdy, boss!" he said in greeting, and bowed quaintly to
Hettie and Ina.</p>
<p>"Took you long enough. Where's Dillon?" replied Ben,
gruffly.</p>
<p>"Wal, you know Dillon always leaves the bad reports for me to
make."</p>
<p>"Did he return with you?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly. He left us at daybreak this mornin' an' beat us
in."</p>
<p>"Is he here now?"</p>
<p>"Sure. I told him he'd better come along with me. But he said
he'd see you later. . . . Boss, Dillon is in purty bad humor. I
never seen him like this. He's another fellar."</p>
<p>"Drinkin'?" queried Ben, sharply.</p>
<p>"No. He's just black as thunder an' sore as a kicked pup."</p>
<p>"That'd be natural for anyone who had my interests at heart,
as Dillon has. But it's odd he didn't come to report. . . . Well,
out with your bad news."</p>
<p>Ben squared himself as if for a blow and frowned upon his old
foreman.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Ben. It couldn't be no wuss."</p>
<p>"Oh, Ben!" cried Ina, who had evidently worried more about her
husband than the impending loss.</p>
<p>"Reckin you an' Hettie better leave us alone," returned
Ben.</p>
<p>Neither of the women moved a step, though Ina subsided into a
chair. Raidy appeared to have lost his usual taciturnity.</p>
<p>"Boss, you're rustled off the range. The last of your stock,
except some stragglin' steers an' yearlin's, is gone--along with
a thousand head of Tom Day's."</p>
<p>Ben Ide made a flashing violent gesture, as if to strike. He
paled. His eyes shot fire.</p>
<p>"They've cleaned me?" he demanded, fiercely, as if still
doubting.</p>
<p>"Yes, boss. I made sure, because I wasn't trustin' Dillon to
give a full report."</p>
<p>Hettie, standing back of Ina's chair, felt both hot and cold;
and she stared at her brother fearfully, expecting him to break
into an ungovernable rage. For Ben had not been himself in weeks,
and lately he had been hard to live with. She had reckoned
without her host, however, for although Ben turned white to the
lips he suddenly became calm and cool. With uncertainty gone he
changed radically.</p>
<p>"Ahuh. So your hunch has come true," he said, almost with
sarcasm. "Wal, I reckon you'll get a lot of satisfaction crowin'
over me an' Dillon."</p>
<p>"No, boss, I won't even say I told you so," returned
Raidy.</p>
<p>"Give me the facts, short an' sweet," said Ben.</p>
<p>"Wal, Tom Day an' his riders were at Silver Meadows when we
arrived. A sheepherder had tipped them off to the drive. We split
up an' rode all around the Meadows. Only a few cattle left. Them
rustlers made a slick job of it. Day an' Franklidge lost over a
thousand head, an' you lost all you had left. A matter of three
thousand head. We took the trail up the canyon. An' say, it was a
bowlavarde clear to the Rim. . . . I was for trailin' the
rustlers to finish a fight. But Day wouldn't let any of us go
down in that hole. We'd have been ambushed an' some of us killed.
Besides, he said we could never have recovered the cattle. Once
turned loose in that jungle of scrub oak, manzanita, an' cactus,
them cattle would have vamoosed like ticks shook off a leaf. So
we turned back."</p>
<p>"You told Tom Day, of course, that Jim Lacy made this drive?"
queried Ben.</p>
<p>"Tom knowed all about it from the sheepherder. Seems thet Lacy
sent Tom word he was goin' to make this big steal. Sent his
respects to Tom an' Judge Franklidge an' said he'd drop in to
Winthrop some day."</p>
<p>"By Heaven! this Lacy is a cool one!" exclaimed Ben, as if
admiration was wrenched from him.</p>
<p>"Cool? Wal, boss, you might call Lacy thet, but I reckon he's
a mixture of hell's fire an' chain lightnin'!"</p>
<p>"I'll hang him," said Ben, with deadly calm.</p>
<p>"No, Ben, if you'll excuse me, I'll say you'll never put a
rope around Jim Lacy's neck. He couldn't never be jailed, either.
He'll die in his boots, with a gun spoutin', an' Gawd help the
men frontin' him!"</p>
<p>"Bah! You talk like Marvie Blaine," retorted Ben, curtly. "An'
you Raidy--a grown man!"</p>
<p>"Boss, it grieves me thet I've lived to disagree with you,"
returned Raidy, with dignity.</p>
<p>"This Jim Lacy is the leader of the Pine Tree outfit,"
asserted Ben, positively.</p>
<p>"Wal, me an' Tom Day reckoned so. An' for once Dillon agreed
with us," replied Raidy. "Tom said Lacy jest got tired of layin'
low an' bein' mysterious. So he comes out in the open. I'll bet
you he'll ride right into Winthrop."</p>
<p>"Raidy, I'm glad Lacy cleaned me out. I'm through waitin'
around to see what's goin' to happen next. I've sent for Sheriff
Macklin an' a posse. This mornin' I got word from Struthers, the
Phoenix sheriff who's made it so hot for rustlers in southern
Arizona. Struthers is in Winthrop at my request. They'll arrive
here not later than to-morrow. I'll have Dillon get twenty-five
of the hardest men he can gather. I'll offer ten thousand dollars
reward for Jim Lacy, dead or alive. I'll spend every dollar I
have to run down Lacy an' his Pine Tree gang."</p>
<p>"Wal, boss, you're talkin' high, wide, an' handsome," replied
Raidy. "But it's not for me to offer opinions. This ranch--an'
for that matter, this whole range--ain't big enough for me an'
your man Dillon. I jest have to quit."</p>
<p>"Very well, Raidy. I'm sorry you see it that way," returned
Ben, coldly, and with a wave of his hand terminated the
interview.</p>
<p>Hettie fled. As she ran out she heard Ina deliver a stinging
rebuke to her husband. Then a door slammed. Hettie hurried home
in a state of mind bordering on a breakdown. She finished her
work in a mechanical way, while slow torment consumed her.</p>
<p>"What's all the row over at Ben's?" her mother inquired,
placidly, from her comfortable chair.</p>
<p>"Rustlers, cattle, foremen, sheriffs, and Heaven only knows
what," replied Hettie, distractedly.</p>
<p>"Well, daughter, don't be upset. You know Ben."</p>
<p>"I thought I did, mother. But I'm doubtful about it now. He
fired Raidy."</p>
<p>"No! Why, that's dreadful! Raidy taught Ben how to ride a
horse. Oh, this dreadful Arizona! . . . But I don't mean that,
Hettie. I love this quiet, sweet wild country. The men,
though--they're--they're loco, as Marvie says. And Ben has got
it, too?"</p>
<p>"Mother, have you seen Marvie to-day?" asked Hettie, suddenly
remembering that she had not.</p>
<p>"Marvie went away yesterday and hasn't come back. At least he
didn't sleep in his bed."</p>
<p>"Oh dear! That wild boy! Here's more to--to worry over. . . .
Mother, I didn't tell you that the reason Marvie came to us is
because Ben discharged him--drove him out of the house."</p>
<p>"Reckon we'll have Ina next," said her mother.</p>
<p>"I--I wouldn't be surprised at anything," returned Hettie,
tearfully.</p>
<p>Hettie went to her room, with the motive of indulging her
grief. But sight of her riding-boots acted powerfully upon her
and she decided to take a ride. Not for days had she been on her
horse. Perhaps a long hard gallop would be good for her; and
moreover, she might meet Marvie on the trail. Could something
have happened to him? It might very well have, Hettie concluded,
with a tremor. He and Rose might have been discovered by that
Cedar Hatt, of whom Rose had such great fear. The very air round
the Ide ranch seemed congested, heavy, sultry, ominous with
menace.</p>
<p>Hettie passed the quarters of the riders at some distance, not
caring to be accosted by Dillon or Raidy. She saw some saddled
horses, dusty and tired, that had evidently just come in. There
were a number of men bunched in a circle, conversing so earnestly
that none espied her. Gaining the stables, she found Pedro and
had him saddle her horse. Soon she was riding fast with the wind
in her face.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But neither a gallop nor a run sufficed to change Hettie's
mood. She rode into the woods, and let her horse walk at will
down the shady trail in the direction from which Marvie always
returned.</p>
<p>And here, alone, under the impelling influence of the forest,
Hettie realized that she was a most miserable and heartbroken
girl, with a terrible sword hanging over her head. How hopeless
her situation! What use to think? There was not a thought nor an
action that could help her in her extremity. Courage and
intelligence had gone with the loss of hope.</p>
<p>A purple haze like smoke hung in the aisles of the forest; the
only sound was the faintest of breezes murmuring in the pines;
the thickets were on fire with golden and scarlet flame of autumn
leaves; the westering sun caught the glint of falling leaf and
pine needle.</p>
<p>Nature seemed so pitiless this day. It went on, calm, sweet,
beautiful, inscrutable, unmindful of the poor little lives of
human beings. Hettie could not derive any solace, any strength,
from either forest or range or desert.</p>
<p>Arizona had killed her dream, as it had ruined her brother.
And the horror of Hettie's state seemed that the climax of this
infernal paradox, the dénouement, the worst, had yet to come.</p>
<p>Suddenly she caught the rhythmic beat of swift hoofs ahead
round a green curve of the trail. That must be Marvie's horse. A
rush of relief swept over her. The pine boughs spread. A big
black horse was upon her before she could pull a rein. She cried
out. But the rider hauled back to his haunches, and that rider
was Nevada.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c19" id="c19">NINETEEN</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Hettie clutched the pommel of her saddle. An awful stunning
shock suspended, for an instant, all her faculties, and every
sensibility except the physical animal instinct of holding her
equilibrium. Then emotion burst the dam.</p>
<p>When Nevada's horse plunged up, his head came abreast Hettie's
horse.</p>
<p><i>"You!"</i> Hettie felt the word leave her stiff lips, but
she heard it only as a whisper.</p>
<p>Nevada swept off his sombrero and bowed low to the mane of his
horse. And as he rose erect he remained bareheaded.</p>
<p>"Wal, shore it's Hettie Ide," he drawled, in the cool,
leisurely, Southern accent that cut into her heart like
blades.</p>
<p>Then they gazed at one another, as if sight was trying to
reconcile the face of dreams with the reality. The face Hettie
looked into had the same lean outline, the dark blue-black shade
of beard against the clear brown tan, the intent light
hazel-flecked eyes, like level piercing points. But it did not
have the soul with which her imagination and memory had invested
it.</p>
<p>"I--saw you--in Winthrop," began Hettie, as if to find relief
from oppression. Silence was impossible.</p>
<p>"Shore. I reckoned you might," he replied. As he spoke he
rolled a cigarette with steady fingers. No surprise, no emotion
that Hettie could read, manifested itself in look or manner. "Too
bad you had to run into me heah!"</p>
<p>"Too bad! . . . It's terrible. But I'm glad," exclaimed
Hettie, quivering, shaking all over.</p>
<p>"Thank you, an' I'm shore sorry I cain't return the
compliment," he said, and bent his head to light the
cigarette.</p>
<p>His cool nonchalance, that she remembered so poignantly,
seemed now to inflame her.</p>
<p><i>"Jim Lacy!"</i> she cried, in scornful, sad haste to
acquaint him with her knowledge of his infamy.</p>
<p>He thrust his sombrero on, tilted back, and as he blew a thin
column of smoke upward his penetrating, inscrutable eyes studied
her face.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you trust me? Oh, why?" she went on, slipping
farther toward an emotional outbreak.</p>
<p>"Hettie, there was a time, long ago, when I'd rather have been
daid than let you know I was Jim Lacy."</p>
<p>"You were ashamed?"</p>
<p>"I shore was."</p>
<p>"Long ago, you said. . . . Then you're <i>not</i> ashamed
now?"</p>
<p>"Wal, it cain't matter now," he rejoined, with a gleam of a
smile.</p>
<p>"Why can't it matter now?" she queried.</p>
<p>He made an expressive gesture, and then gazed down through the
open forest to the colorful desert. His horse rubbed noses with
Hettie's, and gradually backed it across the trail.</p>
<p>"Ben doesn't dream his--his old friend Nevada is you--the
notorious Jim Lacy."</p>
<p>"I reckon not. . . . Too bad he's got to find out pretty
soon!"</p>
<p>"Must Ben--find out?" asked Hettie, huskily. Thought of Ben
augmented her weakness.</p>
<p>Nevada dropped his head. His horse, nosing Hettie's, brought
Nevada closer to her, so that she might have touched him. This
proximity bore upon her with incalculable influence. She pulled
her horse aside, to no avail, for the big black followed with
eager whinny. His rider did not seem to be aware of this
proceeding, or of the proximity that again ensued.</p>
<p>"How can you be so cool--so hatefully cool?" burst out Hettie,
"Ben loved you. I--I . . . What did he care who you were? Why
didn't you always stay Nevada? . . . Ben left no stone unturned
to locate you. Failing that, he came to Arizona because he hoped
you might turn up. . . . You have turned up. But as Jim Lacy--as
a rustler who stole from him. Stole from a friend you once saved
and succored and loved! Did you know those cattle were
Ben's?"</p>
<p>"Shore--I did," replied Nevada, showing a faint pallor.</p>
<p>"Oh, it was a terrible thing to do!" cried Hettie, covering
her face with her hands. "Your pard? It will cut him to the
quick--embitter him forever. . . . And it'll kill <i>me!"</i></p>
<p>His silence, his imperturbability in its unnaturalness roused
her to a sudden furious passion that burned away her tears and
waved her face scarlet.</p>
<p>"Wal, you're a mighty healthy lady after so many years of
dyin'," he drawled, tossing away his half-smoked cigarette.
"Hettie, you always was pretty, but you've grown into a plumb
handsome woman. . . . Reckon the cowboys are sweeter'n ever on
you."</p>
<p>"That must have meant a lot to you," she flashed, breathing
hard.</p>
<p>"Dillon, now. <i>He</i> was."</p>
<p>"Yes. He has made love to me. Begged me to marry him,"
returned Hettie, in fiery flippancy, hoping with a woman's
strange coquetry to make him jealous.</p>
<p>"Wal, you don't say. He's shore a handsome <i>hombre.</i>
Devil with the women, I heah. . . . Why don't you marry him?"</p>
<p>"I--may yet," replied Hettie, somberly. He baffled her. In his
cool, inscrutable presence she felt like a child. And a deep
unplumbed emotion seemed to swell at the gates of her
self-control.</p>
<p>"Hettie, if you do you'll be changin' your mind considerable
from what it was that night at the dance in Winthrop."</p>
<p>"What do you know about that?" she queried, wonderingly.</p>
<p>"Wal, I happened to heah you tell Dillon a few things, an' I
seen him try to get you in his arms."</p>
<p><i>"You!</i> You were there?"</p>
<p>"Shore. An' after you flounced off I introduced myself to
Dillon an' most polite invited him to draw. But he didn't have
the nerve, so I took a punch at his handsome face."</p>
<p>"You struck Dillon on my behalf!" murmured Hettie
softening.</p>
<p>"Wal, yes, partly. But I had it in for him before. . . . By
the way, is he at the ranch?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I saw him at the corrals as I came out."</p>
<p>"Good! I'm shore a lucky <i>hombre</i>--since I took up with
Jim Lacy again."</p>
<p>"You were going to our ranch?" queried Hettie, quickly.</p>
<p>"I <i>am</i> goin', Miss Hettie Ide."</p>
<p>"What--for?"</p>
<p>"Wal, reckon my prime reason is to shoot out one of Dillon's
handsome eyes. But I've another--"</p>
<p>"Oh! . . . You've something against Dillon?"</p>
<p>"Huh! I should rather smile I have, Hettie."</p>
<p>"You'll--you'll <i>kill</i> him?"</p>
<p>Nevada's flashing eye and sweeping gesture were the first
indications of passion he had evinced.</p>
<p>"Reckon if you hadn't held me up heah he'd be daid now. An'
that stands for me, too."</p>
<p>"Ah! Then Dillon is--a--a dangerous man--as you--"</p>
<p>"Hettie, <i>he's</i> a bad <i>hombre.</i> Come from New
Mexico. Name is Ed Richardson, once with the Billy the Kid
outfit. . . . I'll kill him, shore, but he might return the
compliment."</p>
<p>"You--you bloody gunman!" returned Hettie, as if those few
words expressed her infinite amaze and contempt for men who lived
by such a creed.</p>
<p>"Hettie, if he does kill me you can tell Ben the truth, then
come an' smooth back my hair an' wipe my bloody face. Ha! Ha!" he
said, in bitter mockery.</p>
<p>"Hush!" Hettie reined her horse closer, so that her stirrup
locked with Nevada's. "Do not do this terrible deed. For Ben's
sake, if not mine. Be big enough to abandon your blood feud. Give
up this outlaw, rustler, gunman life. . . . Take me away with you
to some far country. I have money. You can start anew. I will
cleave to you--live for you."</p>
<p>"For Gawd's sake, Hettie Ide, are you crazy?" he returned,
stridently.</p>
<p>"Not yet. But I will be soon--if this--goes on," she panted,
and slipped her gloved hand to his shoulder. "Nevada, I--I still
love you. I've always loved you. . . . I forgive all. I surrender
all. I don't care who you are--what you've been. All I ask is
that you save Ben the horror so near--that you take me away and
give up this life. . . . We can plan quickly. I will meet you at
some point on the railroad. . . . Say you will."</p>
<p>"No," he said, hoarsely.</p>
<p>"Nevada! . . . Don't you love me--still?" And she leaned to
him, overcome, betraying all her woman's soul of love, and hope
for him, for Ben, for herself.</p>
<p>"Love you? Ha! Ha!"</p>
<p>"Don't stare. Don't laugh. This means life or death to me. Say
you love me. Say you'll take me."</p>
<p>"Yes, I love you, mad woman. But I cain't accept your
sacrifice. I cain't ruin you. . . . Good Gawd! Hettie, you forget
I'm Jim Lacy!"</p>
<p>"It's because you <i>are</i> Jim Lacy."</p>
<p>"Heavens! This heah is awful! . . . Hettie, I cain't--I
won't."</p>
<p>"You lie, then. You do not love me. <i>I</i> am proving mine.
But you--you are false. You have taken some--other woman. You
don't love me!"</p>
<p>Hettie, dim of eye, saw him loom over her. She felt herself
seized in iron arms and dragged from her horse. Then she was
lifted over the pommel and crushed to his breast, and bent
backward, blind and breathless, a victim of terrible devouring
lips. He kissed her mouth, her cheeks, her eyes, her brow, her
hair, and then again her mouth.</p>
<p>Hettie's senses reeled and almost failed her. When his
violence ceased she felt herself held closely for a long moment,
then let down from the horse until her feet touched the ground.
She was falling when he leaped from the saddle. He set her on the
grass with her back against a tree, and there, presently, her
eyes opened.</p>
<p>Nevada knelt before her, his face convulsed. Slowly it
smoothed out and a wild darkness faded from his eyes.</p>
<p>"There. You've come to. I reckon I must ask you to excuse me
for bein' rough. But I shore couldn't stand that talk aboot not
lovin' you."</p>
<p>"I will not believe--unless you prove it," returned Hettie,
unsteadily, as she reached for her sombrero.</p>
<p>Nevada rose to his feet. "I cain't prove it your way," he
replied, and his features set stone-cold and gray.</p>
<p>"Oh, what have you done to me?" cried Hettie, wildly, as again
passion rose strong and regained the ascendancy over her.</p>
<p>"Reckon nothin' compared to what you've done to me," he
responded, with somber gaze upon her. "Dillon will just aboot
beat me to a gun."</p>
<p>Hettie stood up, holding to the tree trunk. "Nothing. . . .
I've loved you since I first met you. I've been true. I trusted
you. I cared not for your past. I believed in your future. I
prayed for you. My faith in you was as great as my faith in God.
I believed you loved me. That when you rode away from Forlorn
River--to escape the consequences--when you killed Less Setter to
save Ben--I believed you would be true to me, to the higher self
you found through Ben's love and mine. . . . But you were too
little. You went back to the old life--to the old comrades.
Rustlers, gamblers, gunmen! You killed just because you wanted to
keep that name hated and feared. You are a bloody monster. . . .
No doubt you sank to the embrace of vile women--the consorts of
thieves! O my God! it would be my death if I could not kill my
love. But I will. It will lie dead as my faith. . . . You are a
liar, a failure, a weakling. Basest of all is your ingratitude.
You stole from my brother--who loved you."</p>
<p>Nevada's eyes held a blaze like black lightning.</p>
<p>"Reckon that'll be aboot all I want to heah," he said, in
tones she had never heard before.</p>
<p>"That is--all."</p>
<p>He gathered up the reins and vaulted into the saddle, then
turned to gaze down the trail.</p>
<p>"Horses comin'," he said, briefly. "It's Marvie with his girl,
Rose Hatt."</p>
<p>"Yes, I see," returned Hettie, with a start. "Oh, I'm
glad."</p>
<p>"Wal, Miss Hettie Ide," he said, "you might heah somethin'
from Marvie an' Rose. Anyway, don't rustle back home too
quick."</p>
<p>Her lips framed a query she could not speak.</p>
<p>"It's aboot sunset," he went on, with strange gaze upon the
west. "Sunset for Dillon! An' shore sunset for me!"</p>
<p>Then he spurred the big black, and clattering into the trail
soon vanished from sight toward the ranch.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c20" id="c20">TWENTY</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Nevada approached the Ide ranch from that side closest to the
forest, where the pines and cedars trooped down the gentle slopes
of the benches, clear to the most outwardly of the cattle
sheds.</p>
<p>With his brain on fire and his heart like lead, his whole
being crushed under the burning weight of Hettie's outspoken love
and terrible scorn, he halted under cover of the last clump of
cedars, and dismounted, answering to an instinct, true even in
that hour of utter catastrophe, to the instinct which had
preserved him so long as Jim Lacy. Not now, however, was it an
instinct of self-preservation, but one to meet and kill Ed
Richardson, alias Campbell, alias Clan Dillon, late member of the
few surviving Lincoln County war desperadoes.</p>
<p>Wedging this purpose into his stunned brain, Nevada kept
driving it deeper, while he removed saddle and bridle from his
horse and turned it free. He would have no more need of a horse.
Then he crouched in the cedars, under tremendous strain, driving
himself to the exclusion of all thought, of all emotion, of all
faculties except those few cardinally important for the issue at
hand.</p>
<p>When he emerged from under cover of the cedars he might have
been an automaton, with guidance of some grim-strung spirit.</p>
<p>He glided behind brush to the sage and through this to the
pole fence. It led to the back of log cabins, which he marked as
the bunkhouses. The sunset hour was near. Silver-edged purple
clouds hung over the soft rounded foothills. Soon the sun would
sink from behind the broken mass of cloud and slide down into
that golden space behind the ranges. Cowboys, riders, range
hands, foreman, all would be waiting the call to supper. The day
had been hot. Just now, with the first cool breeze breathing down
from the hill, all the men would be outdoors.</p>
<p>There was a fate in many meetings of life, and singularly in
all those that involved Jim Lacy.</p>
<p>He swept his magnified gaze to the left, over pasture and
field, which were open to his sight. A few horses and colts, cows
and calves, a burro, and some black pigs dotted the gray-green
pastures and the brown fields. No rider in sight!</p>
<p>Nevada stole swiftly along the fence to the first high corral.
It contained a number of horses, with saddles and packs stacked
in a corner. He would have to cross this corral, and go through
the others, to reach the rear of the bunkhouses. Climbing to the
top log of the high fence, he peeped over. No man in sight! He
climbed and ran and climbed and ran, quickly gaining the open
gate of the last corral. The two small log cabins and the long
one stood across the open space, with barns to the left and
courtyard on the right, leading up to the Ide homes in the edge
of the forest.</p>
<p>A Mexican boy appeared leading horses to a watering-trough; a
rider came trotting down the long lane between the fields; some
one was driving cows in from the pasture. From behind the cabins
came the loud rollicking laughter of cowboys.</p>
<p>Nevada did not hesitate a moment. Leisurely he strode from the
corral toward the long cabin, making for the nearest end, where
cords of firewood were stacked high. That end, where blue smoke
curled from a stone chimney, would be the kitchen. There would be
a porch on the other side.</p>
<p>Nevada gained the woodpiles. They had been stacked, seemingly,
to furnish him perfect passageway and perfect cover, for the
fruition of this long-planned moment. It never crossed his mind
that Dillon might not be there. Dillon would be there. For the
men who had wronged Jim Lacy or incurred his enmity there existed
a fatality which operated infallibly. Or else Lacy never made a
mistake. It was something that he felt.</p>
<p>He glided between the high stacks of wood. Before he peeped
out he saw horsemen riding down the dusty road which wound away
to the north and Winthrop. Then Nevada put his eye to an aperture
between two billets of cedar that protruded from the stack.</p>
<p>A dozen or more men lounged and sat and stood in plain sight.
Cowboys in shirt sleeves, faces shiny and red, hair glossed and
wet, sat on the ground, backs to the cabin. Nevada recognized
Macklin, the Winthrop sheriff, leaning against the hitching rail,
in conversation with two other men, not garbed as riders. Facing
Nevada was a tall man in black and he had a bright badge on his
vest. He was another sheriff, a stranger to Nevada.</p>
<p>"We sure want to get off by sunup," he was saying to a man
near him.</p>
<p>This man stood with his back toward Nevada. His powerful
supple shoulders showed wonderfully through his white clean
shirt. Nevada recognized that lithe stalwart build, the leonine
neck, the handsome head, with its clustering fair hair.</p>
<p>Dillon! A slight cold thrill ran over Nevada. Following it
came an instinct like that of a tiger to leap.</p>
<p>Nevada swiftly ran his glance over the other men, standing
near and in the background. Ben Ide was not present!</p>
<p>Then Nevada drew back behind the woodpile, loosened his gun in
its sheath, and stood there an instant while the waiting forces
of brain and muscle vibrated into a tremendous unity.</p>
<p>"Come an' get it," sang out the cheery voice of the cook
inside.</p>
<p>"Whoopee! Whoaboy," shouted the cowboys, scrambling up.</p>
<p>At this instant Nevada bounded out swiftly and ran to a
halt.</p>
<p>"HOLD ON!" he yelled, with all the power of his lungs. His
piercing voice made statues of all, even the cowboys stiffening
in half-erect postures.</p>
<p>In the instant of silence that ensued Dillon was the only man
to move and he wheeled swift as a flash, so swiftly that the
receding trace of mirth had not yet left his handsome face.</p>
<p>"Howdy, Dillon!" drawled Nevada, slow and cool.</p>
<p>Macklin shuffled erect in great alarm.</p>
<p>"That's Jim Lacy," he shouted, hoarsely.</p>
<p>"Shore is. Careful now, you outsiders!" warned Nevada, yet
with eye only for Dillon.</p>
<p>Every man in line with Dillon plunged off the porch or darted
into the cabin. The cowboys sank back to the ground, sagging
against the log wall.</p>
<p>Dillon stood on the porch, facing Nevada, scarcely thirty feet
distant. His reaction from careless mirth to recognition of peril
was as swift as his sight. But there followed the instant when
his faculties had to grasp what that peril was and how he should
meet it.</p>
<p>Nevada had gambled on this instant. It was his advantage. He
did not underrate Dillon. He read his mind in those dilating
eyes.</p>
<p>"Wal, you know me," cut out Nevada, icily. "An' I know
you--Dillon--<i>Campbell!</i>--ED RICHARDSON!"</p>
<p>That was the paralyzing challenge. The rustler turned a
ghastly white. The frontier's bloody creed, by which he had
lived, called him to his death. His green eyes set balefully. He
knew. He showed his training. He had no more fear of death than
of the swallows flitting under the eaves above. But he had a
magnificent and desperate courage to take his enemy with him.</p>
<p>Richardson never uttered a word. Almost imperceptibly his body
lowered as if under instinct to crouch. His stiff bent right arm
began to quiver.</p>
<p>Nevada saw the thought in Richardson's eyes--the birth of the
message to nerve and muscle. When his hand flashed down Nevada
was drawing.</p>
<p>Crash! Nevada's shot did not beat Richardson's draw, but it
broke his aim. Boom! The rustler's gun went off half leveled. He
lurched with terrible violence and his gun boomed again. The
bullet scattered the gravel at Nevada's feet and spanged away
into the air.</p>
<p>A wide red spot appeared as if by magic on the middle of
Richardson's white shirt. How terrible to see him strain to raise
his gun-arm!</p>
<p>At Nevada's second shot one of Richardson's awful eyes went
blank. His gun clattered to the floor. He swayed. His arm hooked
round the porch post. Then it sank limp, letting him fall with
sodden thud.</p>
<p>Nevada was the first to withdraw his gaze from that twitching
body. He flipped his gun into the air and caught it by the
barrel.</p>
<p>"Heah, sir," he said to the sheriff with the star on his vest,
and extended the gun butt foremost. "I reckon that'll be aboot
all for Jim Lacy."</p>
<p>The strain on the watchers relaxed. A murmur of wonder ran
through them, growing louder. The sheriff came to a power of
movement and speech.</p>
<p>"What? Lacy, are you handin'--over your gun?" he queried,
hoarsely.</p>
<p>"Wal, I'm not pointin' the right end of it at you," replied
Nevada, and tossed the gun at the sheriff's feet.</p>
<p>"What--the hell?" gasped a weather-beaten old rider, Raidy,
staring hard at Nevada.</p>
<p>Here Macklin came rushing up, to get between Nevada and the
other sheriff.</p>
<p>"Jim Lacy, you're my prisoner," yelled Macklin, beside himself
with the strange opportunity presented and a terror of the
enormity of his risk. He drew his gun. "Hands up."</p>
<p>"Shoot an' be damned, you four-flush officer of the law,"
retorted Nevada, wearily, and turning his back to Macklin he
strode to a seat on the porch steps.</p>
<p>"Run for the boss," shouted Raidy to the cowboys. "Tell him
there's hell come off. Fetch him an' Judge Franklidge."</p>
<p>"Hyar comes Tom Day with his outfit," yelled a cowboy,
excitedly, pointing to the horsemen entering the square. "The
whole range's hyar. Haw! Haw!"</p>
<p>Nevada experienced a weariness of soul and body. It was over.
He did not care what happened.</p>
<p>"Say, give me a smoke--one of you punchers," he said, removing
his sombrero to wipe his clammy brow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c21" id="c21">TWENTY-ONE</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Marvie Blaine came swinging down the trail at a gallop, with
Rose Hatt riding close behind.</p>
<p>Eager excitement lent Hettie the strength to mount her horse.
Nevada's strange eyes and words! What might not Marvie and Rose
have to tell her?</p>
<p>"Hey there, Hettie!" shouted Marvie, when still some rods
distant. "Look who's comin' behind."</p>
<p>Hettie complied, with emotions changing, rising again in a
flood, new, bewildering, looming darkly to threaten her with
panic. Marvie rode right upon her before halting.</p>
<p>"Say, you look like the devil!" he ejaculated, with anxious
concern.</p>
<p>"Marv, that's the way I feel," replied Hettie.</p>
<p>Rose joined them, to crowd her pony close, eager yet shy, with
eyes alight and lips parted. "Oh, Miss Hettie!" she cried,
rapturously. "Marvie's brought me to you. I--I'll never go
back--to the brakes."</p>
<p>"My dear, you're welcome to my home," returned Hettie, warmly,
leaning to kiss the flushed face.</p>
<p>"Hettie, you've seen a ghost--the same ghost I seen," declared
Marvie, shrewdly.</p>
<p>"Oh, Marvie lad--a ghost indeed!" moaned Hettie. "Nevada! . .
. He just left me--to--to kill Dillon!"</p>
<p>"No news to me," shouted Marvie, fiercely. "I've got to see
that. . . . Fetch Rose. But go round. Keep away from the
corrals."</p>
<p>The last he delivered over his shoulder as he urged his horse
into the trail and beat him into a run. In a moment he passed out
of sight among the pines. The swift patter of hoofs died
away.</p>
<p>"Come, Rose--ride," suddenly cried Hettie, with a start,
striking her horse.</p>
<p>The spirited animal, unused to that, broke into a gallop, and
then a run. Hettie looked back. The girl was close behind, her
hair flying in the wind, her face flashing. Her pony was fast and
she could ride. Hettie turned her attention to the trail and the
low branches of pines and the obstructing brush. Soon she was
flying at a tremendous gait through the forest. The speed, the
violence added to her agitation.</p>
<p>Where the trail emerged from the pines, to drop down on the
sage and cedar slope adjacent to the ranch land, Hettie turned
her horse and kept to the top of the slope. Soon she passed
Nevada's big black horse grazing on the sage. Her heart took a
great bursting leap. <i>"An' shore sunset for me!"</i> Nevada's
words of resignation and sadness rang in her ears like bells of
doom.</p>
<p>Suddenly she imagined she heard a shot. She turned her ear to
the left. Another! A gun-shot--then two sharp cracks, clear on
the breeze. She reeled in her saddle. Almost she put her horse at
the ranch fence. But she kept on in wild flight, forgetting Rose,
clutching with left hand at her breast, where uncertainty
augmented to supreme agony.</p>
<p>Her fast horse, keen at the freedom afforded him, swept on as
in a race, on by the corrals and gardens, up over the low bench,
and through the woods to her cabin, where her mother stood waving
frantically from the porch. Hettie rode on, over the swaying
bridge, into the shady green glade before Ben's house.</p>
<p>Here she pulled her iron-jawed horse to a snorting halt. She
saw men running. She heard Rose's pony come clattering over the
bridge. Then Marvie's horse appeared over the rise of ground
toward the corral. What breakneck speed! How he thundered up the
drive!</p>
<p>One sight of Marvie's flashing face answered Hettie. She could
have screamed in her frenzy. Marvie reached her at the moment
Rose came up. His horse reared and pounded. Marvie jerked him
down with powerful arm, and closed with Hettie.</p>
<p>"Nevada's down there--handcuffed!" he whispered, pantingly.
"Dillon's dead! . . . Oh, there'll be--hell now! . . . But not a
word from--you an' Rose!"</p>
<p>The boy's heated face, the horses, Rose so white and rapt, the
running riders, the houses and the pines--all blurred in Hettie's
sight. She had to fight fiercely to recover. She felt the girl's
strong hand on her, steadying her in the saddle. The deadly
faintness passed. Her eyes cleared and her breast lifted to give
rein to a tumult there.</p>
<p>Ben and Judge Franklidge were striding out to meet the running
cowboys.</p>
<p>"Judge, I told you I heard shots," Ben was saying. "Somethin's
happened!"</p>
<p>"Seems like. But don't let it upset you," replied the
judge.</p>
<p>"There's Marvie. . . . Has he gone loco?" exclaimed Ben, in
amaze, as the boy, riding wildly, scattered the men coming up the
slope.</p>
<p>"By thunder! Ben," replied Franklidge, suddenly espying Hettie
and Rose, as they rode in upon the lawn.</p>
<p>At that juncture the first cowboys reached Ben to blurt
out:</p>
<p>"Boss, Jim Lacy's here! He just killed Dillon."</p>
<p>"Wha--at?" shouted Ben, incredulously.</p>
<p>As the cowboy repeated his news Raidy arrived at the head of
three more of Ben's hands, and all began to jabber pantingly.</p>
<p>"One at a time," ordered Ben, harshly. "What the hell's wrong?
Raidy!"</p>
<p>The old foreman drew himself up steadily, though with heaving
breast.</p>
<p>"Boss, I have to report--Dillon's been killed--Jim Lacy!"</p>
<p>Ben Ide leaped straight up in sudden ungovernable fury. His
face turned dusk red. He clenched his fists high above his
head.</p>
<p>"On my own place?" he thundered.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. Right on the cook-house porch."</p>
<p>"Dillon dead?"</p>
<p>"He is indeed, sir," replied Raidy. "Lacy shot him through the
middle--then put out his right eye."</p>
<p>"Murder!" gasped Ben.</p>
<p>"Not much! . . . It was an even break. Lacy dropped out of the
clouds, seems like. Dillon was game, sir, an' quick--but not
quick enough."</p>
<p>"Killed! My best man," rasped out Ben, stridently. "Where's
this Jim Lacy?"</p>
<p>"He's sittin' on the cook-house porch," replied Raidy.
"Handcuffed, sir. . . . The sheriffs put him in irons."</p>
<p>Ben cracked a hard fist into his palm. "They got him, then. .
. . Judge Franklidge, I knew we'd land that gunman-rustler."</p>
<p>"Ide, it's a little embarrassing to know what to do with
this--this Jim Lacy--now we've got him," replied the judge,
dryly.</p>
<p>"Damn him! I'll show you."</p>
<p>"An', boss," interrupted Raidy, "Tom Day has rid in with his
outfit. They wanted to lynch Lacy. But Tom roared at them like a
mad bull. Reckon you'd better hurry down."</p>
<p>Ina came running from the house. "Ben, what--in the--world's
happened?" she asked, in alarm.</p>
<p>"Ina, it's all over, so don't get scared," returned Ben.
"Dillon has been shot by that bloody devil, Jim Lacy. Why, the
man must be insane! Comin' here to carry out his queer feud!
Right at my back door!"</p>
<p>"Dillon? Is--is he dead?" asked Ina, fearfully.</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am," interposed Raidy, touching his sombrero.</p>
<p>"Oh, how dreadful!" Then Ina caught sight of Hettie and Rose.
She ran to them. "Hettie, isn't it awful? That Dillon! I wonder.
. . . You look sort of wild, Hettie. Who's this girl with
you?"</p>
<p>"Rose Hatt. Marvie's friend," replied Hettie, bending down.
"Oh, Ina, I've--"</p>
<p>Ben, striding away with his men, turned to call out, "Ina,
stay back, an' keep those girls with you!"</p>
<p>"But why can't I come, too?" burst out Ina.</p>
<p>"No place for women," he returned, curtly. "There's one dead
man now an' soon there'll be another."</p>
<p>Ina halted with a revulsion of feeling too strong for
curiosity.</p>
<p>"Hettie, we mustn't go," she said.</p>
<p>"Listen, old girl. Chucks for Ben Ide. There's not enough men
in Arizona to keep me away," declared Hettie, wildly. Then she
bent down over Ina to whisper. "Jim Lacy is Nevada!"</p>
<p>Ina put a hand over her mouth to stifle a scream. Then she
gasped, "No!"</p>
<p>"Yes! I've known it for long. And I <i>met</i> him today. . .
. O God! . . . But I--I can't talk now. Come."</p>
<p>Hettie, with Rose on her left, rode at the heels of the
striding men. Ina ran beside Hettie, clinging to the stirrup,
looking up now and then with dark bright eyes.</p>
<p>They traversed the short lane to enter the wide square, on the
other side of which stood the quarters of the ranch hands. There
were ten or more saddle horses standing bridles down. Hettie's
startled sight included a dark group of men massed in front of
the cook-house. There! Nevada must be there--soon to be
confronted by Ben. How terrible for Ben--for both of them!
Hettie's state became one of palpitating suspense, of
nerve-racking torture. Yet an overwhelming, incomprehensible
curiosity consumed her.</p>
<p>They reached the crowd of cowboys and men strange to Hettie,
some of whom faced around.</p>
<p>"Open up here," shouted Ben, in a loud hard voice. "Spread
out. . . . Let me see this man."</p>
<p>The crowd split in a hurry, leaving a wide V-shaped space, at
the apex of which sat the prisoner on the edge of the porch. The
dead man lay on the ground, covered with a blanket.</p>
<p>Hettie recognized Nevada, though his head was bowed and his
sombrero hid his face. His hands, in irons, hung over his knees.
What a strange, pathetic figure! Hettie's sore heart failed her.
What mystery was here? The moment seemed charged with indefinable
and profound portent.</p>
<p>Macklin, the Winthrop sheriff, beaming and bristling with his
importance, advanced a stride, with pompous gesture.</p>
<p>"Wal, Mr. Ide, here's your man. I've got him in irons," he
boomed.</p>
<p>Ben advanced, his gaze passing from the dead man on the ground
to the slumping prisoner.</p>
<p>"Jim Lacy," he called, sternly.</p>
<p>There was no movement from Nevada, except that he seemed to
contract. Nobody else stirred. The air was fraught with tragic
suggestion, with inscrutable meaning that yet transfixed the
onlookers.</p>
<p>"Lacy, I'm goin' to hang you!" rang out Ben Ide.</p>
<p>Still no response from this notorious gunman, whose daring,
whose cold nerve, had long been a subject for campfire
gossip.</p>
<p>"Stand up. Let me look at you," ordered Ben, suddenly.</p>
<p>With a violent wrench the prisoner jerked out of his dejected
posture, to slip off the porch and stand erect. He ducked his
head, removing the sombrero, which fell to the ground. Composed
and pale then he faced his judge.</p>
<p>Ben Ide seemed struck by lightning.</p>
<p>"My God! . . . Who--is this--man?" he faltered, almost
inaudibly.</p>
<p>There was no answer. The crowd of onlookers gazed
spellbound.</p>
<p><i>"Who are you?"</i></p>
<p>"Wal, Ben, I'm shore sorry we met this heah way," came the
reply, in the old slow cool accents. "But I reckon it had to
be."</p>
<p>"NEVADA!"</p>
<p>With the hoarse wondering cry, Ben leaped forward to clasp his
old friend in a close embrace and hold him so a long moment.</p>
<p>Hettie saw Ben's face in convulsion, his eyes shut tight, his
expression one to bewilder the staring bystanders. To her it was
beautiful and somehow soul-satisfying. Her eyes were dim, her
heart pounding.</p>
<p>"My old pard! Found at last! . . . Thank God!--I feared you
were dead. . . . All these long years! But I hoped an' prayed. .
. . An' here you are. It's too good to be true. I reckon it's a
dream. Say somethin' to me--you old wild-horse-huntin' pard.
Nevada!"</p>
<p>Ben held him back, hands on his shoulders, oblivious to all
but that lean stone-gray face.</p>
<p>"Yes, Ben . . . Nevada to you--but to all the world--only Jim
Lacy," replied Nevada, sadly.</p>
<p><i>"What?"</i> cried Ben, with a violent start. Then his
nervous quick hands ran down to Nevada's irons. "God Almighty! .
. . You Jim Lacy?"</p>
<p>"Yes, to my shame--pard."</p>
<p>Ben's transition to reality was swift and passionate. Suddenly
white, with blazing eyes, he tore at Nevada's handcuffs. "I don't
care a damn who you were. You're Nevada to me--my friend--my
pard. An' so you'll be forever."</p>
<p>"Wal, Ben--it's shore good to heah you," replied Nevada, his
voice trailing off.</p>
<p>"Macklin, unlock these irons," ordered Ben.</p>
<p>"What? . . . But, Mr. Ide--he's my prisoner!" protested the
sheriff, aghast. "He's wanted for rustlin'. He killed your
foreman. The law--"</p>
<p>"To hell with your law!" interrupted Ben, fiercely. "Unlock
his irons!"</p>
<p>"You hired us to ketch this man!"</p>
<p>"Quick. Before I throw my gun on you!"</p>
<p>His hand went to his hip. The crowd stirred with restless feet
and whispered exclamation. Tom Day stepped out to get between
Macklin and Ben.</p>
<p>"Easy now, Ben. Let old Tom have a word," he said, in his big
voice, now full and resonant. "We've had enough gun-play for one
day. . . . Macklin, give me the keys to these irons."</p>
<p>The sheriff, red of face, flustered and intimidated, complied
with poor grace. Day unlocked the irons, removed them, and
somewhat with contempt cast them at Macklin's feet.</p>
<p>Nevada rubbed his wrists and then looked up to smile at
Day.</p>
<p>"Put her thar, Texas Jack," boomed the old rancher, with a
wonderful smile wreathing his rugged face. "We're shore from the
old Lone Star State. Let me be the first to shake the good right
hand thet did for Dillon."</p>
<p>"Wal, Tom, shore you needn't rub it in," drawled Nevada, as he
yielded to the vigorous onslaught of the older man.</p>
<p>"Come heah, Franklidge," called Day, beckoning to the judge.
"I reckon it's aboot time."</p>
<p>Ben Ide stood motionless, his jaw dropping, his eyes
expressive of an incredulous wonder that he could not voice. His
feeling was surely shared by others there. As for Hettie, she
seemed to feel her blood and brain whirl madly. Texas Jack! That
warm, splendid smile of the old rancher! Judge Franklidge moving
forward with dignified step and grave, kindly face!</p>
<p>But the other black-garbed sheriff intercepted him.</p>
<p>"Mr. Ide, these are sure most extraordinary proceedings," he
said, authoritatively.</p>
<p>"Hell, yes!" burst out Ben. "But it's an extraordinary
case."</p>
<p>"The law must take its course. Even if this Jim Lacy was an
old pard of yours, he's now a criminal. Reckon his gun-play was
always on the level. But he's a cattle an' hoss thief. We set out
to hang the leader of this Pine Tree rustler outfit. Sure Lacy is
him. His killin' of Dillon proves that. If this is no hangin'
case, it sure is one for jail."</p>
<p>"Struthers, I hired you to come up here," returned Ben,
deliberately. "I admit I wanted Jim Lacy shot or hanged. But I've
changed my mind. He's my friend. I owe my life, my fortune, my
family, all to him. There's some mystery--some mistake here.
That's for me to learn, an' not for you."</p>
<p>"All right. But I'll take Lacy to Phoenix for trial," replied
Struthers.</p>
<p>"If you do, it'll be over my dead body. Take care, Struthers.
This isn't Phoenix. You're up in the brakes."</p>
<p>Thus Ben Ide answered to his few months in Arizona. The
situation looked grave again. But Judge Franklidge interposed to
push Struthers back.</p>
<p>"You have no jurisdiction here unless I give it," he said.
Then he turned to Ben with courtly kindness. "My son, don't
distress yourself further. Just have a little patience."</p>
<p>"Patience!" ejaculated Ben, as if he had not heard aright</p>
<p>Judge Franklidge advanced to place his left hand on Nevada's
shoulder and extended his right, which Nevada quickly met.</p>
<p>"Jack, you may be from Texas, as old Tom here brags, but you
sure belong to Arizona," he said, heartily.</p>
<p>"Wal, I should smile," corroborated Day, heartily.</p>
<p>Judge Franklidge turned to indicate in slight gesture the dead
man on the ground.</p>
<p>"Dillon, of course, was the leader of this Pine Tree rustler
gang," he asserted. "Otherwise you would not have risked
revealing yourself here?"</p>
<p>"Wal, reckon I wouldn't," replied Nevada, with a smile that
held no mirth.</p>
<p>"Dillon!" boomed Tom Day, his eyes rolling at the dead man.
"Who was he, Jack?"</p>
<p>"Ed Richardson, late of New Mexico."</p>
<p>"Richardson? I know aboot him. Lincoln County war
<i>hombre?</i> Billy the Kid outfit?"</p>
<p>"That's the man, Tom."</p>
<p>"Wal, I'm a son-of-a-gun!" ejaculated the old rancher. "I
begin to see light. Dillon was thick with Stewart. An' Stewart
never worked the same for me after Dillon became foreman heah at
Ben's. This mawnin' he was gone. An' he knowed where we was bound
for. . . . Jack, what you make of thet?"</p>
<p>"Stewart was one of the three Arizonians that Richardson took
into his New Mexican outfit."</p>
<p>"Ahuh! Who's the other two?"</p>
<p>"Burt Stillwell an' Cedar Hatt."</p>
<p>"Stillwell! . . . Jack, didn't you--meet thet <i>hombre</i>
just lately?" queried Day, his eyes glinting.</p>
<p>"Yes. It was Stillwell who stole Ben's horse, California Red.
I made him send Red back. Reckon that r'iled Stillwell. . . . An'
Marvie Blaine shot Cedar Hatt to-day. So the Pine Tree outfit is
shore broke."</p>
<p>Ben Ide, in bewildered state, crowded closer to the
speakers.</p>
<p>"Marvie Blaine shot Cedar Hatt?" ejaculated Judge
Franklidge.</p>
<p>"Good Lord!" added Day in his booming voice. "What next? Ben,
you listenin' to all this?"</p>
<p>"Tom--I'm stumped," replied Ben, hoarsely.</p>
<p>"Spill it, Jack. Tell us about Marvie. Heaven help us now!"
went on Day.</p>
<p>"I happened on Cedar Hatt to-day," replied Nevada. "He was
ridin' down in one of the brakes an' I was on top. Wal, I soon
saw he was trailin' some one. So I worked ahaid an' got down off
the Rim. There I happened to run on Marvie an' his girl, Rose
Hatt. They were spoonin' under the trees an' never saw me. I was
lookin' for Cedar an' I knew Cedar was lookin' for them. So I
kept quiet. Pretty soon Cedar slips up, right on to them. An' he
begins to rave. Rose talked back an' shore Marvie showed spunk.
Cedar knocked him down, an' then Rose, too. That riled Marvie an'
he tore into Cedar. It looked bad, with Cedar pullin' at his gun.
He got it out, but Marvie fought him for it. . . . An', wal, in
the fight Cedar dropped the gun an' Marvie quick as a cat
snatched it up. Usin' both hands, he throwed it on Cedar an'
shore bored him twice."</p>
<p>"Whoop-ee!" yelled one of the cowboys at the back of the
crowd.</p>
<p>"By thunder! I'd whoop myself if I had any voice left,"
returned Tom Day. "Where's Marvie? Come heah, you gunslingin'
kid!"</p>
<p>"Rose Hatt is heah, too," said Nevada. "An', Tom, it'd be wal
for you an' Judge Franklidge to talk to her. Rose is a good
honest girl. Dillon was after her. An' Cedar Hatt had dragged
Rose away from home to meet Dillon. That was how Rose found out
aboot the Pine Tree outfit. An' she confessed to me."</p>
<p>"Wal, I'll be darned!" replied Day, feelingly. "The lass looks
a little scared an' white, Judge. I reckon we needn't heah her
say now, in this crowd. But that kid Marvie--he shore don't look
scared."</p>
<p>"Come here, my lad," called Judge Franklidge, beckoning.</p>
<p>Marvie slipped off his horse and stalked forward to confront
the three men. Hettie thrilled at sight of him, yet she could
have wept and screamed with mirth. Marvie, if he were any
character at all, was surely Nevada. In look, in walk, in manner!
He had a big black gun in his chaps pocket, and another smaller
one in his belt. What a moment for Marvie Blaine!</p>
<p>"Son, what's this we heah?" asked Day, bluntly. "Did you shoot
Cedar Hatt?"</p>
<p>"Reckon I did," replied Marvie. "Here's his gun. It happened
just about as Nevada told you."</p>
<p>"Who's Nevada?"</p>
<p>Marvie laid a hand on his friend.</p>
<p>"Oho! You mean Jim Lacy heah?"</p>
<p>"No, I mean Nevada," replied the lad, stoutly. "That Jim Lacy
handle doesn't go with me."</p>
<p>"Marvie, you speak for me," interposed Judge Franklidge. "He
may indeed be Nevada and Jim Lacy. But for me he will always be
Texas Jack. He has worked for me for two years. And before that
for Tom Day. We found him to be the best cowboy who ever threw a
rope for us. And more--a splendid honest man whom it is my
privilege to call friend--and whom I would be happy to take into
my cattle business."</p>
<p>"Hey, you sheriff rustlers," boomed Tom Day, with loud
satisfaction, "did you heah that? Wal, listen to some more. Texas
Jack volunteered to clean up this Pine Tree outfit. He had my
backin'. He had Judge Franklidge's office behind him. He had free
hand to become a rustler an' thief, to drink an' gamble an' shoot
his way into the secret of the Pine Tree outfit. Do you savvy? Or
are you wearin' your hair too long? There won't be any arrest.
There won't be anyone danglin' on a rope."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h1><a name="c22" id="c22">TWENTY-TWO</a></h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Hettie lay upon her bed, face to the open window, with the
cool sweet sage-laden wind blowing in upon her. Dusk had fallen.
The last rose and gold of the afterglow of sunset lingered in the
west. She never knew how she had gotten from Ben's courtyard to
her room. Dimly she remembered faces and murmuring voices that
had no meaning for her.</p>
<p>The door opened--closed. Ben knelt beside her bed--took her
hands--kissed her face.</p>
<p>"Hettie, I came as quick as I could get away," he said, with
deep agitation. "I was knocked off my pins. But happy--oh, girl,
never so happy before, except on the day Ina married me! . . .
When I could think I remembered you. So here I am."</p>
<p>"Oh--Ben!" she whispered, and clung to him, her slow
overburdened heart lifting painfully.</p>
<p>"Hettie dear--joy never kills," he replied, tenderly.</p>
<p>"If it were--only joy," mourned Hettie.</p>
<p>"Child, there's nothing <i>but</i> joy," he rushed on. "It was
a terrible shock. To find out old Nevada--was Jim Lacy. But we
always knew he was somebody bad. No, not bad. But somebody wild
an' great. You knew--Hettie. . . . An' now he's turned up. The
wonder of it is that he had hidden the old identity. He had given
up the old wild life. He had found honest work an' had lived
clean an' fine. As we knew him in those happy days at Forlorn
River. So you see all your love an' faith an' hope were
justified. He <i>was</i> worth it. Thank God I never lost--"</p>
<p>"Hush! You're killing--me!" gasped Hettie, writhing from his
embrace.</p>
<p>"Hettie! Why, sister, this isn't like you," he expostulated,
in anxiety. "You're overcome. It has been too much for you."</p>
<p>"Not the joy--not the excitement," she returned. "I've been a
poor miserable creature! . . . A coward! A selfish, headstrong
woman! Jealous, little! . . . Oh, so poor in love--in faith!"</p>
<p>It came out then, gradually, sometimes incoherently, the story
of her meeting with Nevada; and Hettie, in her self-abasement,
magnified all the shame and ignominy--all the bitter invective
and scorn which she had flung into his face.</p>
<p>Ben drew her head back to his shoulder and smoothed her
disheveled hair.</p>
<p>"Well! . . . I understand now. Too bad! But there are excuses
for you. Didn't you believe in him--love him--keep yourself for
him all these years? Some things are too much for anybody."</p>
<p>"He--will--never--forgive," she sobbed, with the relief that
came through his sympathy, his championship.</p>
<p>"Nevada? Why, that fellow would forgive anythin'."</p>
<p>"I--can never--forgive myself."</p>
<p>"Hettie, it will all come right. Don't you remember how you
harped on that? Beat it into my poor thick head! . . . An', lo!
it has come right. . . . Nevada could not hurt you."</p>
<p>"I have--hurt myself. I've lost something. My ideal has failed
me."</p>
<p>"No--no. You're just overwrought by this sudden crash. Please,
Hettie. I don't mean cheer up. But brace up an' see it through.
Where's your Ide spunk?"</p>
<p>"Gone--gone."</p>
<p>"Well, then, get it back. I swear to you Nevada will be just
like I am now. On my knees to you!"</p>
<p>"Where is he?"</p>
<p>"I left him in the livin'-room, playin' with Blaine. The kid
took a shine to him <i>pronto.</i> An' Nevada. Lord! no one would
ever dream of him bein' what we've learned to understand by the
name Jim Lacy. . . . Hettie, there's somethin' so simple an'
great about Nevada. He's just himself now as we remembered him.
He's Nevada, that's all."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hettie lay awake many hours, with anguish slowly wearing away
to a regurgitation of something quite as full of pangs. The night
wind moved through the pines, sweeping, swelling, lulling.
Coyotes added their lonesome chorus. White stars shone from the
dark blue sky. When she fell asleep she dreamed vague, unreal,
distorted dreams, in which she seemed the central shadow among
shadows of Nevada, Marvie, Rose, Ben, and that mocking handsome
Dillon. But she awoke to a new day--new as the bright morning,
and with a dawning hope, like the gold and blue of the Arizona
sky.</p>
<p>She had no time for her own thoughts. Marvie rushed in upon
her, in the kitchen, to be followed by Rose, shy, sweet, modest
as the wildflower for which she was named. Already they had been
out in the woods and now they were as hungry as bears. Mrs. Ide
looked upon them with wonder and favor. They wanted to go to
Winthrop. Would Hettie go? Rose must have clothes and books and
things. How Marvie's face glowed under his freckles! And Rose was
in a transport. Had she forgotten that sordid home down in the
brakes?</p>
<p>"Not to-day," replied Hettie, to their importunities.
"To-morrow, maybe, if Ben consents."</p>
<p>"What has that Ben Ide to do with my affairs?" demanded
Marvie, loftily. "I'd like to have you know <i>I</i> can ride for
Franklidge or Tom Day or any other big rancher in Arizona."</p>
<p>Hettie sensed trouble for Ben when he came to attempt
reconciliation with Marvie. Ben would surely need her aid.</p>
<p>"Marv, boy, of course I know," she said. "But you must use
some sense. Rose is to have a home with me. And I shall take her
to San Diego for the winter. I should think you would want to be
near her this fall, and also go to San Diego, at least for a
while."</p>
<p>Marvie wilted under that. What a master-stroke, thought
Hettie.</p>
<p>"Well, if Ben crawls to me I'll consider comin' back," replied
Marvie, condescendingly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After breakfast Tom Day came over to pay his respects to
Hettie and her mother. How bluff and genial and substantial he
was!</p>
<p>"Wal, lass," he said at parting, "I reckon the Ides an' the
Days can go back to ranchin' again, thanks to thet Texas Jack of
ours. Shore, we'll have rustlin' bees again an' mebbe for years
to come. But there'll be a spell now, like these Indian-summer
days. Folks can sleep an' be happy. An' you youngsters can make
love. Haw! Haw! . . . Hettie lass, I've been a-wonderin' aboot
you. I'm shore a keen old fox. Wal, <i>adios,</i> an' God bless
you."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Later in the morning Ben came to her so utterly abject that he
was funny.</p>
<p>"Now what?" queried Hettie. "You needn't come to me for
sympathy."</p>
<p>"Aw, Hettie, that's what Ina said, an' she stuck to it," said
Ben. "But I've got to tell somebody. An' Nevada is moonstruck or
somethin'. He never heard me."</p>
<p>"All right, Bennie," smiled Hettie, relenting.</p>
<p>"You know I fired Raidy--well, of course I had to go to him
an' ask him to come back. Reckon the old fellow was hurt deep. He
didn't rub it in, but he was sure cold. For a long while I
apologized, made excuses, swore, an' did about everythin' before
he would take back the old job. But at that he was nothin'
compared to Marvie Blaine."</p>
<p>"Indeed! Yes, I remember you fired Marvie, too," said
Hettie.</p>
<p>"You would have died laughin' to see that kid," went on Ben,
ruefully. "I sent for him. Did he come? Not much. He sent word
back by my messenger that if I wanted to talk to him I could hunt
him up. So I had to. An' I'm darned if I don't believe he watched
me an' kept dodgin' me. Well, anyway, I found him at last an'
asked him to forget our difference. Whew! . . . Say, he's
expanded in this Arizona air. He had an argument that floored me.
It <i>was</i> logic, though I wouldn't admit it. He made me
crawl. By George! You know I love Marvie an' I could never let
him leave Ina an' me till he's grown up. He had more dignity than
Judge Franklidge an' more conceit than any cowboy I ever saw. He
swelled up like that Sheriff Macklin. Well, after he got his job
back at a higher salary he put on the screws some more. He
actually hit me for the reward I offered for any clue leadin' to
the apprehension of the Pine Tree outfit. That reward was a
thousand dollars. Marvie claimed Rose was his clue. The cheeky
little rooster! But Nevada backed him up. An' as a matter of
fact, 'most everythin' came through Rose. So I promised it to
him. . . . Now what do you say?"</p>
<p>Hettie leaped up gladly. "Good for Marv! Now, Ben, run over
and crawl to Inaa. Then we--<i>you</i> all can be happy
again!"</p>
<p>"Ahuh! I get the hunch that 'you' aren't included. I'll bet
before this day ends you'll be as crazy as Marv an' as mum as his
little wood mouse, Rose."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Still Hettie was not to have any of the solitude she craved.
No sooner had Ben gone than Judge Franklidge appeared.</p>
<p>"I've come over to bid you and Mrs. Ide good-by," he said, in
his kindly way. "It has been a rather staggering time. But we're
on our feet again, and 'ridin' pretty,' as the cowboys say."</p>
<p>Then leaning closer to Hettie he continued in lower tone: "You
recall one day at my home--when you said somethin' mysterious to
me then, but pertinent now. It was about--<i>Nevada."</i></p>
<p>"I remember--Judge Franklidge," murmured Hettie,
trembling.</p>
<p>"Well, would I be correct if I--sort of put two and two
together--or perhaps I should say one and one? . . . Nevada and
Hettie, for instance?"</p>
<p>His persuasive voice, deep with understanding, and his linking
together the two names, quite subdued her poor and rebellious
resistance. She dropped her head, murmuring a faint
affirmative.</p>
<p>"I'm glad I hit upon the truth," he said, with eagerness. "I
watched you yesterday and I believe I saw then something of your
ordeal. And I see now in your face the havoc that tells of your
pain. It is my earnest hope to soothe that pain, Hettie Ide, and
I know I can do so. Listen. It has been a terrible shock for you
to find in your Texas Jack--or Nevada, as you call him--no other
than the infamous or famous Jim Lacy. This is natural, but it is
all wrong. There need be no shame, no fear, no shrinking in your
acceptance of this fact. I've met and trusted no finer man than
this same Jim Lacy. But I did not come to eulogize him. . . . I
want to make clear in your mind just what such men as Jim Lacy
mean to me. I have lived most of my life on the frontier and I
know what its wilderness has been, and still is. There are bad
men and bad men. It is a distinction with a vast difference. I
have met or seen many of the noted killers. Wild Bill, Wess
Hardin, Kingfisher, Billy the Kid, Pat Garrett, an' a host of
others. These men are not bloody murderers. They are a product of
the times. The West could never have been populated without them.
They strike a balance between the hordes of ruffians, outlaws,
strong evil characters like Dillon, and the wild life of a wild
era. It is the West as any Westerner knows it now. And as such we
could not be pioneers, we could not progress without this
violence. Without the snuffing out of dissolute and desperate men
such as Dillon, Cedar Hatt, Stillwell, and so on. The rub is that
only hard iron-nerved youths like Billy the Kid, or Jim Lacy, can
meet such men on their own ground. That is all I wanted you to
know. And also, that if my daughter cared for Jim Lacy I would be
proud to give her to him."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Judge Franklidge," replied Hettie, lifting her
head to look straight into his eyes. "But you misunderstand
my--my case. I do not mind--that Nevada has been Jim Lacy."</p>
<p>"For Heaven's sake! Then, why all this--this--I don't know
what?" burst out the judge, in smiling amaze.</p>
<p>Hettie glanced away, out into the green black-striped
forest.</p>
<p>"I scorned him. I believed him lost to--to . . . I failed in
faith. And I fear he will never forgive."</p>
<p>"Hettie Ide," returned Franklidge, with solemn finality, "this
Texas Jack won't even know he has anything to forgive."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before Hettie could recover from this ultimatum Marvie waylaid
her. Full of importance and authority, added to something of
mystery, he hauled Hettie off the porch and out under the
trees.</p>
<p>"Hettie," he whispered in her ear, "I fixed it for you."</p>
<p>"Marvie! . . . Are you--Oh, if you--"</p>
<p>"Keep in the saddle," he interrupted, shaking her. "Nevada
just told me he was dyin' of love for you. . . . There now,
Hettie, don't look like that. I'm dead serious. Honest to God!
Cross my heart! . . . Didn't you make my Rose happy? Why, I'd go
to hell for you. An' Nevada knows it. He's sufferin'. He thinks
you ought to send for him, if you can forgive him for bein' Jim
Lacy."</p>
<p>Hettie could only cling mutely to this glad-eyed boy who was
torturing her.</p>
<p>"So I fixed it. You run out there across the bench," he went
on, pointing with eager, trembling finger. "You know. There among
the pines where I always find you. Go now. Nevada is watchin'.
He'll come. I swore I'd get you there if I had to pack you. An' I
will."</p>
<p>Hettie kissed his brown lean cheek, then ran wildly into the
shelter of the pines. First she meant only to escape Marvie and
all of them. But an irresistible magnet drew her to the secluded
nook where she went so often alone to gaze out under the low
cover of green to the purple sage and the changing radiance of
the desert.</p>
<p>Nevada was there--somehow the Nevada of old. Hettie ran into
his arms.</p>
<p>"I--love--you! I love you!" she cried, imploringly. "Forgive
me. It was my one failure. I was the weak one--not you."</p>
<p>Hours passed and sunset again widened its golden effulgence
down over the sage hills to the rolling slopes. Purple clouds
like ships sailed in a sea of gold and rose.</p>
<p>Hettie and Nevada sat with their backs to the great pine tree,
their cheeks together, their hands clinging.</p>
<p>"Ben sprung somethin' on me," Nevada was saying. "Why not all
of us rustle down to San Diego! Shore, it floored me. . . . But
I'd like you to get away from heah just now, for a little. . . .
So, darlin' Hettie, would I be askin' too much if--if--"</p>
<p>"No. Ask me anything," murmured Hettie.</p>
<p>"If I'd ask you to marry me?"</p>
<p>"If! . . . Do you?"</p>
<p>"Shore. I reckon I'm darin' to."</p>
<p>"No," said Hettie.</p>
<p>He accepted that in startled silence.</p>
<p>"I mean no--you are <i>not</i> asking too much. . . . Oh,
Nevada! Yes! Yes!"</p>
<p>The last golden flare of sunset burned from over the darkening
range.</p>
<p>"Arizona is smilin' at us," said Nevada, gazing at the sunset
glow upon her rapt face.</p>
<p>"Nevada is smiling down upon me," she replied, dreamily.</p>
