<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>It was characteristic of Willard Huntington Wright, known to the
great public as S. S. Van Dine, that when he died suddenly on April
11, 1939, he left <i>The Winter Murder Case</i> in the form in
which it is published, complete to the last comma. Everything he
ever did was done that way, accurately, thoroughly, and with
consideration for other people. It was so with the entire series of
the Philo Vance mysteries.</p>

<p>He has himself told the story of becoming a writer of mysteries
in an article called, "I Used to be a Highbrow, and Look at Me
Now." He had worked as a critic of literature and art, and as an
editor, since he left Harvard in 1907. And this he had done with
great distinction, but with no material reward to speak
of&mdash;certainly no accumulation of money. When the war came it
seemed to him that all he had believed in and was working for was
rushing into ruin&mdash;and now, twenty-five years later, can
anyone say he was wrong? There were other influences at work on him
perhaps, but no one who knew Willard and the purity of his
perceptions in art, and his devotion to what he thought was the
meaning of our civilization as expressed in the arts, can doubt
that the shattering disillusionment and ruin of the war was what
brought him at last to a nervous breakdown which incapacitated him
for several years. He would never have explained it so, or any
other way. He made no explanations, or excuses, ever, and his many
apologies were out of the kindness of a heart so concealed by
reticence that only a handful ever knew how gentle it really was.
So at last all that he had done and aimed to do seemed to have come
to ruin, and he himself too.</p>

<p>Only a gallant spirit could have risen up from that downfall,
and gallantry alone would not have been enough. But Willard had
also an intellect&mdash;even despair could not suppress
it&mdash;which worked on anything at hand. One might believe that
if his fate had been solitary confinement he would hare emerged
with some biological discovery based on the rats that infested his
cell. Anyhow, his doctor finally met his demands for mental
occupation with the concession that he read mysteries, which he had
never read before. The result was, that as he had studied painting,
literature and philosophy, he now involuntarily studied and then
consciously analyzed, the mystery story. And when he recovered he
had mastered it.</p>

<p>He was then heavily in debt, but he thought he saw the
possibility of freeing himself from obligations a nature of his
integrity could not ignore, or in fact endure, by what he had
learned in his illness. He wrote out, at some ten thousand words
each, the plots of his first three murder cases, thought through to
the last detail, footnotes and all, and brought them to the Century
Club to a lunch with an editor of the publishing house that has put
all of them before the public.</p>

<p>This editor knew little about mystery stories, which had not
been much in vogue since Sherlock Holmes, but he knew Willard
Wright. He knew from far back in Harvard that whatever this man did
would be done well, and the reasonable terms&mdash;granting the
writer's talent&mdash; that Willard proposed were quickly
accepted.</p>

<p>It is now thirteen years since Philo Vance stepped out into the
world to solve <i>The Benson Murder Case</i> and, with that and the
eleven others that followed, to delight hundreds of thousand of
readers soon hard pressed by the anxieties and afflictions of a
tragic decade. Each of these famous cases was set forth, as were
the first three, in a long synopsis&mdash;about ten thousand
words&mdash;letter perfect and complete to that point in its
development. After the first three of these synopses, the publisher
never saw another, nor wanted to, for he knew beyond peradventure
that the finished book would be another masterpiece in its kind.
Nor did he ever see the second stage of development, but only the
third, the final manuscript&mdash;and that he read with the
interest and pleasure of any reader, and with no professional
anxieties. But this second stage in the infinitely painstaking
development of the story was some 30,000 words long, and it lacked
only the final elaboration of character, dialogue, and atmosphere.
<i>The Winter Murder Case</i> represents this stage in S. S. Van
Dine's progress to its completion, and if the plot moves faster to
its culmination than in the earlier books, it is for that
reason.</p>

<p>They say now that Philo Vance was made in the image of S. S. Van
Dine, and although Willard smoked not <i>R&eacute;gies</i> but
denicotined cigarettes, there were resemblances. Both were
infinitely neat in dress, equally decorous and considerate in
manner, and Vance had Willard's amazingly vast and accurate
knowledge of a thousand arts and subjects, and his humorously
sceptical attitude toward life and society. But in fact the
resemblance would stand for only those with a superficial knowledge
of Willard Huntington Wright. Vance in so far as he was Wright, was
perhaps the form under which a gallant, gentle man concealed a
spirit almost too delicate and sensitive for an age so turbulent
and crude as this. Willard was not one to wear his heart upon his
sleeve&mdash;but there were daws enough to peck, as there always
are, and they found it where his friends always knew it to be, near
the surface, and quick to respond.</p>

<p>As for the principles upon which he based his writing, and which
brought new life into the craft of detective literature, they were
succinctly set down by him in his famous twenty rules which are to
be found at the end of this volume.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br>
AN APPEAL FOR HELP</h2>

<p><b>(<i>Tuesday, January 14; 11 a.m.</i>)</b>
</p>

<p>"How would you like a brief vacation in ideal
surroundings&mdash;winter sports, pleasing company, and a veritable
mansion in which to relax? I have just such an invitation for you,
Vance."</p>

<p>Philo Vance drew on his cigarette and smiled. We had just
arrived at District Attorney Markham's office in answer to a
facetious yet urgent call. Vance looked at him and sighed.</p>

<p>"I suspect you. Speak freely, my dear Rhadamanthus."</p>

<p>"Old Carrington Rexon's worried."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Vance drawled. "No spontaneous goodness of heart in life.
Sad. So, I'm asked to enjoy myself in the Berkshires only because
Carrington Rexon's worried. A detective on the premises would
soothe his harassed spirits. I'm invited. Not flatterin'. No."</p>

<p>"Don't be cynical, Vance."</p>

<p>"But why should Carrington Rexon's worries concern me?
<i>I'm</i> not in the least worried."</p>

<p>"You will be," said Markham with feigned viciousness. "Don't
deny you dote on the sufferings of others, you sadist. You live for
crime and suffering. And you adore worrying. You'd die of ennui if
all were peaceful."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," returned Vance. "Not sadistic. No. Always strivin'
for peace and calm. My charitable, unselfish nature."</p>

<p>"As I thought! Old Rexon's worry <i>does</i> appeal to you. I
detect the glint in your eye."</p>

<p>"Charming place, the Rexon estate," Vance observed thoughtfully.
"But why, Markham, with his millions, his leisure, his two adored
and adoring offspring, his gorgeous estate, his fame, and his
vigor&mdash; why should he be worrying? Quite unreasonable."</p>

<p>"Still, he wants you up there instanter."</p>

<p>"As you said." Vance settled deeper into his chair. "His
emeralds, I opine, are to blame for his qualms."</p>

<p>Markham looked across at the other shrewdly. "Don't be
clairvoyant. I detest soothsayers. Especially when their guesses
are so obvious. Of course, it's his damned emeralds."</p>

<p>"Tell me all. Leave no precious stone unturned. Could you bear
it?"</p>

<p>Markham lighted a cigar. When he had it going he said:</p>

<p>"No need to tell you of Rexon's famous emerald collection. You
probably know how it's safeguarded."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Vance. "I inspected it some years ago. Inadequately
protected, I thought."</p>

<p>"The same today. Thank Heaven the place isn't in my
jurisdiction: I'd be worrying about it constantly. I once tried to
persuade Rexon to transfer the collection to some museum."</p>

<p>"Not nice of you, Markham. Rexon loves his gewgaws fanatically.
He'd wither away if bereft of his emeralds...Oh, why are
collectors?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know. I didn't make the world."</p>

<p>"Regrettable," sighed Vance. "What is toward?"</p>

<p>"An unpredictable situation at the Rexon estate. The old boy's
apprehensive. Hence his desire for your presence."</p>

<p>"More light, please."</p>

<p>"Rexon Manor," continued Markham, "is at present filled with
guests as a result of young Richard Rexon's furlough: the chap has
just returned from Europe where he has been studying medicine
intensively in the last-word European colleges and hospitals. The
old man's giving a kind of celebration in the boy's
honor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know. And hoping for an announcement of Richard's betrothal
to the blue-blooded Carlotta Naesmith. Still, why his anxiety?"</p>

<p>"Rexon being a widower, with an invalid daughter, asked Miss
Naesmith to arrange a house party and celebration. She
did&mdash;with a vengeance. Mostly caf&eacute; society: weird
birds, quite objectionable to old Rexon's staid tastes. He doesn't
understand this new set; is inclined to distrust them. He doesn't
suspect them, exactly, but their proximity to his precious emeralds
gives him the jitters."</p>

<p>"Old-fashioned chap. The new generation is full of incredible
possibilities. Not a lovable and comfortable lot. Does Rexon point
specifically?"</p>

<p>"Only at a fellow named Bassett. And, strangely enough, he's not
of Miss Naesmith's doing. Acquaintance of Richard's, in fact.
Friendship started abroad&mdash;in Switzerland, I believe. Came
over on the boat with him this last trip. But the old gentleman
admits he has no grounds for his uneasiness. He's just nervous, in
a vague way, about the whole situation. Wants perspicacious
companionship. So he phoned me and asked for help, indicating
you."</p>

<p>"Yes. Collectors are like that. Where can he turn in his hour of
uncertainty? Ah, his old friend Markham! Equipped with all the
proper gadgets for just such delicate observation. Gadget Number
One: Mr. Philo Vance. Looks presentable in a dinner coat. Won't
drink from his finger-bowl. Could mingle and observe, without
rousing suspicion. Discretion guaranteed. Excellent way of
detecting a lurking shadow&mdash;if any." Vance smiled resignedly.
"Is that the gist of the worried Rexon's runes by long-distance
phone?"</p>

<p>"Substantially, yes," admitted Markham. "But expressed more
charitably. You know damned well that old Rexon likes you, and that
if he thought you'd care for the house party, you'd have been more
than welcome."</p>

<p>"You shame me, Markham," Vance returned with contrition. "I'm
fond of Rexon, just as you are. A lovable man...So, he craves my
comfortin' presence. Very well, I shall strive to smooth his
furrowed brow."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br>
GLAMOR IN THE MOONLIGHT</h2>

<p><b>(<i>Wednesday, January 15; 9 p.m.</i>)</b>
</p>

<p>Markham notified Carrington Rexon, and we left New York the
following afternoon in Vance's Hispano-Suiza.</p>

<p>It was a cold, clear day, and fresh snow had fallen during the
night. The drive to Winewood in the Berkshires would ordinarily
have taken about five hours, but the roads north of the city were
deep in snow, and we were late in arriving at the Rexon estate.
Darkness had settled early, but the night was white with stars, and
the moon was luminous.</p>

<p>It was nearly nine o'clock when we turned in through a wide
stone gateway that marked the outer limits of the vast estate.
There was no one to direct us, and when we had reached the crest of
a high rocky hill, Vance was confused as to which turning to take.
There were half-hidden tracks in one of the forks of the narrow
road, and we turned to the right to follow them.</p>

<p>A mile or so farther on, the road sloped gently downward into a
narrow snowclad valley at the far end of which precipitous cliffs
rose to a tree-crested plateau. Vance let the car coast noiselessly
into the still white fairyland.</p>

<p>As we reached the base of the long incline the sound of faint
music came to us through the trees on our left. There was no
habitation visible, and the music intensified the fantasy of the
setting which spread before us.</p>

<p>Applying the brakes, Vance stopped the car and, stepping out,
moved towards the source of the lilting notes.</p>

<p>We had gone scarcely a hundred yards when, through the trees
which hid us from view, we spied a small frozen pond on which a
girl was skating. The music came from a small portable phonograph
placed on a rustic bench at the edge of the pond.</p>

<p>The girl, in a simple white skating costume, seemed unreal in
the light of the moon and stars. She was going through one
difficult skating figure after another with serious repetition, as
if trying to perfect their intricacies. Vance suddenly became
attentive.</p>

<p>"My word!" he whispered. "Magnificent skating!"</p>

<p>He stood fascinated by the girl's proficiency as she executed
various school figures and complicated free routines.</p>

<p>The phonograph ran down and, as the girl completed an involved
jump and spiral spin, Vance approached her with a cheerful
greeting. At first she was startled; then she smiled shyly.</p>

<p>"You must be new guests at the Manor," she remarked in a timid
voice. "I'm so sorry you caught me skating. It's sort of a secret,
you see...Maybe you won't tell anyone," she added with a note of
appeal in her voice.</p>

<p>"Of course, we shan't." Vance studied the girl critically. "I
believe I remember you&mdash;I was at the Manor some years ago.
Weren't you the friend and companion of Miss Joan?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "I was. And I still am. I'm Ella Gunthar. But I
don't remember you. It must have been when I was a little
girl."</p>

<p>"My name is Philo Vance," Vance told her. "I was just driving to
the Manor, and lost my way. When I heard your music I came over in
the hope of finding my bearings."</p>

<p>"You're not seriously lost," she said. "This is the Green Glen
and if you go back up the hill and take the narrow road to the
right for about a mile, you'll see the Manor just ahead."</p>

<p>Vance thanked her, but lingered a moment. "Tell me, Miss
Gunthar: if you are Joan's companion at the Manor, why do you skate
on this little pond so far away from the main house?"</p>

<p>The girl's lovely face seemed to cloud for a moment.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't want to hurt Joan's feelings," she answered
cryptically. "I always come to the Green Glen at night when my
duties are over at the Manor, to do my skating."</p>

<p>"But the phonograph," said Vance; "isn't it frightfully heavy to
carry all this way?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't keep it at the Manor." She laughed. "I keep it in
Jed's hut, just around the curve in the road, by that big cypress
tree. And I keep my skates and skating clothes there, too. It's all
a secret between Jed and me."</p>

<p>Vance smiled at her reassuringly.</p>

<p>"Well, I promise the secret will go no farther. But it's really
a magnificent secret. Yon know, don't you, that you skate
beautifully? You're one of the most talented performers I have ever
seen."</p>

<p>The girl blushed with pleasure.</p>

<p>"I love skating," she replied simply.</p>

<p>A few minutes later we had turned into the driveway to the
brilliantly lighted Rexon Manor.</p>

<p>As a bald elderly butler led us through the lower hall we could
hear the boisterous hilarity of many guests in the drawing
room&mdash;snatches of popular music, laughter, raised voices: a
gay and youthful clamor.</p>

<p>Carrington Rexon, alone in his den, greeted us with old-world
dignity. It was the first time I had met him, but I was not
unfamiliar with his features, as pictures of him had frequently
appeared in the Metropolitan press. He was a tall, slender,
impressive man in his sixties; aloof and stern, and with an
imperious air of feudalism. He vaguely suggested Sargent's famous
portrait of Lord Ribblesdale.</p>

<p>"Ah, Vance! It was generous of you to come. Perhaps you think I
am unduly apprehensive..."</p>

<p>The door opened and a dark, serious young man of athletic build
stood on the threshold.</p>

<p>Rexon turned without surprise.</p>

<p>"My son Richard," he informed us with undisguised pride. Then:
"But why are you deserting our guests?"</p>

<p>"I'm a bit fed up." Then the young man shrugged his shoulders
apologetically and smiled. "I guess I'm not used to it. It's such a
change&mdash;"</p>

<p>A girl of about twenty-five appeared in the doorway and looked
about.</p>

<p>The elder Rexon somewhat relaxed his stern manner and presented
us. Her likeness, too, I had seen many times in the New York
papers. Carlotta Naesmith had been a vivid and gifted debutante a
few years before. She was a colorful auburn-haired young woman,
animated and vital, with sagacious eyes and an air of
self-assurance. She nodded to us casually, and turned to young
Rexon.</p>

<p>"Completely overcome, Dick? Has the gaiety got you down? Come,
don't desert the ship just when the sea's getting stormy."</p>

<p>"I think Carlotta is quite right, Richard," Carrington Rexon
commented. "You came home for relaxation. Forget your scalpels and
microbes for a while. Go on back with Carlotta, and take Mr. Vance
with you. He'll want to meet your friends."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br>
THE BOURBON GLASS</h2>

<p><b>(<i>Wednesday, January 15; 10:30 p.m.</i>)</b>
</p>

<p>An unusually gay and colorful sight confronted us in the great
drawing room. Groups of young people stood about joking and
laughing; others danced. A spirit of carefree revelry animated the
scene.</p>

<p>Carlotta Naesmith was a capable hostess. She led us through the
boisterous throng, introducing us haphazardly.</p>

<p>"This is Dahlia Dunham," she said, snaring a wiry and tense
young woman of perhaps thirty. "Dahlia's a political spellbinder,
full of incredible phrases, and death to hecklers. She'll stump for
any cause from Socialism to Fletcherism&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But not for prohibition, dear," the other retorted in a raucous
unsteady voice, as she withdrew her arm from Miss Naesmith's and
hurried toward the miniature bar.</p>

<p>Another girl came up, complaining.</p>

<p>"A hell of a place! No landing field! When you snare the Rexon
millions, Carlotta, see to it that Dick builds one."</p>

<p>She was blonde and frail, with liquid eyes that dominated her
pointed face. I recognized the much publicized Beatrice Maddox
before Carlotta Naesmith presented us. She had recently won fame as
an airplane pilot, and only a governmental veto had stayed her
proposed solo flight across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>"What's up, Bee?" came a rumbling voice behind me, and a young
Irish giant threw his arms about Miss Maddox. "You look glum. Out
of gas? So am I." He whisked her away to the bar.</p>

<p>"That was Pat McOrsay," Miss Naesmith told us. "He drives 'em
fast. Won last year's auto grind at Cincinnati. He's sweet on Bee,
but she holds mere auto racers in contempt. Maybe they'll
compromise. I did want you to meet Pat&mdash;he's such a.
beast...But wait. There's another speed demon of a kind over
there...Hi there, Chuck," she called across the room. "Stop trying
to tout Sally and come over here a moment&mdash;if you can make
it."</p>

<p>Chuck Throme, the internationally famous gentleman jockey who
had won the last Steeplechase at Aintree, staggered stiffly up. His
eyes wouldn't focus, but his manner was impeccable.</p>

<p>"Sit down, darling, and meet Mr. Vance," Miss Naesmith exhorted.
"Don't try it standing up. Your stirrups'll bend."</p>

<p>Throme drew himself up indignantly to his five-feet-five and
bowed with a Chestertonian flourish. But the supreme gesture was
not completed. He continued his obeisance to the rug and lay
there.</p>

<p>"That's one race Chuck didn't win," laughed our <i>cicerone</i>.
"Let's move on. Some assistant starter will put him back in the
saddle...Isn't it positively disgusting, Mr. Vance? Liquor is a
frightful curse. Saps the brain, undermines the morals, and all
that...Which reminds me: let's take an intermission in our round of
social duties and have a drink."</p>

<p>She led us to the bar.</p>

<p>"I'm very demure&mdash;for Richard's sake. I drink only Dubonnet
in public. But don't let my girlish restraint affect your batting
average. Everything's available, including trinitrotoluene."</p>

<p>Vance drank brandy. As we stood chatting a tall, rugged,
sunburnt man came up and put his arms possessively about Miss
Naesmith.</p>

<p>"I'm still yearning to know your answer, Carlotta," he blustered
good-naturedly. "For the next-to-the-last time: Are you, or are you
not, coming with me to Cocos Island when Dick returns to his
bone-sawing?"</p>

<p>"Ha!" Carlotta Naesmith swung about and pushed him away
playfully. "Still crooning your Once-Aboard-the-Lugger ditty.
You're inelegant, Stan. And right under Dick's nose."</p>

<p>Richard Rexon showed no annoyance. He came forward and, putting
one hand on the other man's arm, introduced him to us. It was
Stanley Sydes, a young society man with too much money, who spent
his time on expeditions in quest of buried treasure.</p>

<p>Vance knew of his exploits, and a brief discussion took
place.</p>

<p>"A playboy bulging with good money who spends it hunting dirty
doubloons!" Carlotta Naesmith laughed. "There's a paradox&mdash;or
is the whole world crazy except me?"</p>

<p>"Not a paradox, Miss Naesmith," Vance put in pleasantly. "I
understand Mr. Sydes' urge perfectly. It's really not the treasure,
y' know. It's the quest."</p>

<p>"Right!" boomed Sydes. "The joy of outwitting others, of solving
riddles; and the acquisition of the unique...Hell, I'm talking like
a collector.&mdash;Forgive me, Richard. No offense to your eminent
sire." A noisy group opposite attracted his attention, and he
joined them.</p>

<p>His place at the bar was taken almost immediately by the girl
who had been bantering with Throme.</p>

<p>"My God, Sally!" Miss Naesmith greeted her. "Really alone?
Hasn't your gentleman jockey regained his
mount?...Gentlemen,"&mdash;she turned to us&mdash;"we have here
none other than Sally Alexander, the inimitable&mdash;pride of the
Purple Room, off-color raconteuse and pianist extraordinary. A
one-woman slum. She carried the Blue Book to the masses&mdash;and
made 'em like it. A feat, egad!"</p>

<p>"I'm being maligned, gents," Sally Alexander protested. "I'm
elegant, no end."</p>

<p>"I quite agree," Vance defended her. "I've heard Miss Alexander
sing, and never once have I blushed."</p>

<p>"That must have been when she sang in the village choir, in her
sub-deb days."</p>

<p>"Just for that," retorted Miss Alexander, "I'm going to take
Dick away from you." And, slipping her arm through Richard Rexon's,
she led him to the dance floor.</p>

<p>Miss Naesmith shrugged. She looked at Vance.</p>

<p>"Had enough of this, Sir Galahad? There are other exhibits in
the zoo. Nothing really special, however. Am I not an honest
guide?"</p>

<p>"Honest and charming." Vance set down his glass. "But isn't
there a Mr. Bassett?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Jacques..." She looked round the room. "He's Richard's
friend, you know. A more or less imported specimen, I believe.
Anyway, he came over on the boat with Dick and is always comparing
our ski runs with those of Switzerland&mdash;to the detriment of
ours, of course. Maybe he does yodel and live on goat's milk. I
wouldn't know. Though I do know he speaks American with a prairie
accent&mdash;if my ears don't lie."</p>

<p>She caught sight of Bassett.</p>

<p>"There's your man, in the far corner, drinking lustily by
himself. Come along. You can have him gladly. Then go and rescue
Dick. Sally'll be at the risqu&eacute;-story stage by now."</p>

<p>Jacques Bassett sat at a small table, drinking Bourbon. He was
tall, dark, aggressively athletic. His heavy eyebrows met over a
broad flat nose.</p>

<p>He talked about Europe. Vance showed interest. Swiss winter
resorts came up. Vance asked questions. Bassett expatiated. He was
eloquent about the toboggan runs and the ski trails at Oberlachen
in the Tyrol. Vance mentioned Amsterdam. But the subject had no
interest for Bassett. He wandered away.</p>

<p>Vance turned his back. Then he threw his handkerchief over the
glass from which Bassett had been drinking. Slipping it into his
pocket, he left the room abruptly.</p>

<p>A little later I found Vance with Carrington Rexon in the den.
Another man was seated with them before the log fire. He was in his
late forties, with steel-grey hair, and a soft voice which seemed
to cover a tension: obviously a man of the world, with a highly
professional manner which was rigid, but not without ingratiation.
I was not surprised to find that he was Doctor Loomis Quayne, the
Rexon physician.</p>

<p>"Doctor Quayne," Rexon explained, "dropped by to see my daughter
Joan. But the excitement of so many guests has wearied her and she
retired long ago." His voice was wistful.</p>

<p>(Vance had told me during our drive to Winewood something of
Joan Rexon's tragedy: how she had fallen and injured her spine
while skating, when she was only ten years old.)</p>

<p>"Joan's fatigue need not worry you, my dear Rexon," the doctor
assured him. "It's natural in the circumstances. This little
excitement may do her good, in fact&mdash;stimulate her interest,
lead her mind along new lines. Psychological therapy is our chief
recourse just now...I'll drop in again tomorrow. I hope I'll see
Richard then, too. I've hardly talked with him since he came. But
I'm glad to find him looking as well as when I saw him on my trip
abroad two years ago."</p>

<p>"Dick's in the drawing room now," Rexon suggested with a
twinkle.</p>

<p>The doctor smiled. "No, not this evening. I must be going soon.
I left the motor of my car running so I won't have to bother
priming it. These cold days the starter doesn't work so well...And
I think I prefer the quiet of your den, if I may sit and finish my
highball."</p>

<p>"Can't say that I blame you, doctor...This new generation..."
Rexon shook his head disapprovingly.</p>

<p>As we talked on, largely in generalities, but with an occasional
allusion to Richard Rexon's future in medicine, it became evident
that there was something deeper than the mere professional
relationship between Rexon and Quayne; a touch of intimacy,
perhaps, due to long and tragic association.</p>

<p>At length the doctor rose and bade us good night. Vance and I
left Carrington Rexon shortly after.</p>

<p>"A strange and dizzy household." Vance sprawled in an easy chair
in his room. "No wonder old Rexon's jittery. Probably feels lost in
the midst of the unknown. Obviously determined on Carlotta as a
daughter-in-law, though; he's just the type to crave a dynastic
marriage for his son. And the girl's not deficient in gifts. Nice;
but too vivid for my aging tastes. And Richard. An admirable chap.
Too serious for this outfit. Strange, too, his attitude toward
Carlotta. Not all it should be. Seemed quite indifferent to the
treasure hunter's poaching. That rather irked the lady. I
wonder...Interesting creature, Sydes. Has a mental quirk. He put
his finger on it, too. A collector! Just that...But Bassett. Not a
nice person. Worries old Rexon. Carlotta feels it, too. Something
familiar about those cold eyes. Queer. And why should he pretend
about Oberlachen? No ski runs or toboggan slides there. Only a lake
and a castle and a few peasants. Probably never been there. He met
Richard at Saint Moritz. He would. And when I mentioned Amsterdam,
Jacques wasn't having any. Well, well...No, Van. As I said. A dizzy
lot. Social life at its gaudiest. Too much mental makeup."</p>

<p>He brought out his <i>R&eacute;gie</i> cigarettes, lighted one,
and stretched his legs.</p>

<p>"And all through the evening I kept thinking of little Ella
Gunther. Natural and fresh. Lovely. However..."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br>
THE FIRST MURDER</h2>

<p><b>(<i>Thursday, January 16; 8 a.m.</i>)</b>
</p>

<p>The next morning at eight there was excited knocking at our
door.</p>

<p>"Mr. Vance! Mr. Vance!" I recognized the old butler's voice.
"Mr. Rexon says will you please come to the den at once, sir."</p>

<p>Vance jumped up. "What's wrong, Higgins?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know."</p>

<p>"Right!"</p>

<p>He dressed speedily, and we went into the hall. A woman, in the
black livery of a housekeeper, was bent over the railing of the
stairs. She heard us and backed against the wall, eyes staring,
body rigid. Vance halted, looked at her sharply. She was tall, well
built, about forty. She had green eyes, black hair, a cryptic face.
A superior woman, but over-taut.</p>

<p>"Could you hear?" Vance's tone was cold.</p>

<p>"There's tragedy!" she said, in a tense, contralto voice.</p>

<p>"Common commodity of life. Relax."</p>

<p>We hurried downstairs.</p>

<p>"The Manor's strangest creature so far," Vance remarked to me.
"Inhibited. Menacing. Knows too much. Volcanic. But only
smouldering. <i>She's</i> tragedy. God help her..."</p>

<p>Carrington Rexon was in a house gown. With him in the den was a
huge middle-aged man in a lumberjacket, corduroy trousers, and
laced leather boots. He was pale and nervous. There was sweat on
his hands as he steadied himself against the mantel.</p>

<p>"Eric Gunthar here, my overseer," Rexon told us, "just found the
body of Lief Wallen in Tor Gulch near here. He's evidently fallen
from the ledge on top. Gunthar came in to report to me and get aid.
Would you go with him, Vance? I've already phoned for the
doctor...Wallen was the guard of the Manor's west wing, where the
Gem Room is."</p>

<p>"An indication perhaps. Quite. I understand. Gladly."</p>

<p>"Lief must have slipped," Gunthar put in thickly,</p>

<p>"Be sure you have someone replace him tonight," ordered Rexon.
"Better take a couple of men to bring him up," he added.</p>

<p>"Darrup's down at the lower rink. I'll find another." Gunthar's
hand brushed his forehead, "Wallen was a bad sight, Squire...Can I
have another drink&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"You've had too much already," snapped Vance. "Move!"</p>

<p>Gunthar led the way sullenly. As we crossed the main road just
before the house, a strange shabby figure appeared. A straggly
white beard accentuated his stooped shoulders. He shuffled as he
walked, but there was wiry energy in his movements. He turned
quickly toward a clump of trees, as if to avoid us. Gunthar hailed
him peremptorily.</p>

<p>"Come here, Jed. We need you." The old man shuffled up
obediently. "Lief's gone over the crags at Tor Gulch. We'll be
bringing him up."</p>

<p>The old man grinned childishly. For some reason the tragedy
seemed to amuse him. "Maybe you're drinking too much, Eric. Ella
said you struck her last week. You shouldn't do that. The Gulch'll
hold more'n one."</p>

<p>We picked up Guy Darrup, the estate carpenter. Gunthar
explained. Darrup's eyes clouded. There was unfriendliness in them.
As we headed westward down the path he said: "I guess that'll make
your job safe for a while now, Mr. Gunthar."</p>

<p>Gunthar snarled. "Get on. Mind your own business. Maybe
<i>you'd</i> like to be overseer?"</p>

<p>"I'd do everyone fair." There was bitterness in the remark.</p>

<p>We took a circuitous route to the base of the rocky crags,
passed through a cluster of trees over which the mist hung. We went
north across a frozen stream, then turned in the general direction
from which we came.</p>

<p>"You're Miss Ella's father, aren't you, Gunthar?" Vance spoke
for the first time.</p>

<p>Gunthar gave an affirmative grunt.</p>

<p>"Who's <i>he</i>?" With a move of the head Vance indicated the
old man shuffling briskly far ahead.</p>

<p>A sudden decision prompted ingratiation on Gunthar's part. "Old
Jed. He was overseer here before me. Pensioned off now. He's
cracked. Lives alone down in the Green Glen&mdash;named it himself.
Doesn't mingle. We call him the Green Hermit...Nasty business about
Lief, with the house full of guests&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That remark of Darrup's. Is there talk of a new overseer?"</p>

<p>"Hell! They're always talking. I make 'em work. They don't like
it."</p>

<p>Old Jed turned abruptly to the right past an eruption of
shrubs.</p>

<p>"Hey," bawled Gunthar, "How do <i>you</i> know where to go?"</p>

<p>"I reckon I know where Lief is," Jed cackled. He disappeared
behind a projecting rock.</p>

<p>"He's cracked," Gunthar repeated.</p>

<p>"Thanks for the information." As Vance spoke a shout came from
Old Jed.</p>

<p>"Here's Lief, Eric."</p>

<p>We came up. A crumpled body, hideously twisted, lay at the foot
of a stone cliff. The face was torn and clotted, and the bare head
was violently misshapen. There was a dark pool of coagulated
blood.</p>

<p>Vance leaned over the figure, examined it closely; then he stood
up. "No doctor can help. We'll leave him here. Darrup'll watch.
I'll phone Winewood." He looked up at the cliffside and then
through the trees at the Manor towers beyond.</p>

<p>Gunthar waved Old Jed away.</p>

<p>"You really oughtn't strike Ella, Eric," the old man admonished
with a faint grin as he moved off round the cliffs to the flat
meadow.</p>

<p>"Can we get to the top of the cliff on our way back to the
Manor?" asked Vance.</p>

<p>Gunthar hesitated. "There's a steep short cut back a ways. But
it's a dangerous climb&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll take it. Get going."</p>

<p>When we had struggled up the slippery, treacherous incline,
Gunthar indicated the approximate spot where Lief Wallen must have
gone over. There were shrub oaks near the edge of the cliff and
Vance moved among them, gazing down at the thin layer of crusted
snow. Suddenly he knelt beside a sturdy tree bole. "Blood,
Gunthar." He pointed to an irregular dark patch a few inches from
the tree trunk.</p>

<p>Gunthar sucked in his breath. "Holy God&mdash;up here!"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite." Vance rose. "No. No accident. Too bad the wind last
night obliterated the tale of footprints. However...We'll be going.
Work to do."</p>

<p>Gunthar halted abruptly. "Old Jed knew just where the body
was!"</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully." Vance hastened down the long slope toward the
Manor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br>
THE CURSE OF THE EMERALDS</h2>

<p><b>(<i>Thursday, January 16; 9:30 a.m.</i>)</b>
</p>

<p>Carrington Rexon was drinking his coffee in the den when we
returned.</p>

<p>"Up to the police," Vance announced. Then he explained..."I'll
phone Winewood." He went to the telephone and conversed
briefly.</p>

<p>Rexon rang. Higgins entered.</p>

<p>"Oh! Ah!" Vance sat down. "Many thanks. Just coffee, Higgins."
He lighted a cigarette with unusual deliberation and stretched his
legs before him.</p>

<p>Rexon was silent, coldly calm. He studied Vance over his coffee
cup.</p>

<p>"Sorry you should be bothered," he murmured. "I was hoping my
anxiety was unwarranted."</p>

<p>"One never knows, does one, old friend? We do our best."</p>

<p>Lieutenant O'Leary, of the Winewood police, a tall, shrewd and
capable man, far superior to the ordinary country constable,
arrived simultaneously with Doctor Quayne.</p>

<p>"Sorry, doctor. No need for you." Vance gave the details.
"Fellow's been dead for hours, I'd say. It's the Lieutenant's
problem."</p>

<p>"Doctor Quayne is our official physician," said O'Leary.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Vance threw his cigarette in the grate. "That facilitates
matters. We'll go down at once. Darrup's watching the body. I
ordered it left where Gunthar found it. Forgive my intrusion,
Lieutenant. Sole interest Mr. Rexon."</p>

<p>"Quite correct, sir," O'Leary returned. "We'll see how the land
lies."</p>

<p>"It lies exceeding black despite the snow."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Doctor Quayne was examining Lief Wallen's
body.</p>

<p>"A long fall," he commented. "Battered badly by the impact. Been
dead all of eight hours. Poor Wallen. An honest, conscientious
chap."</p>

<p>"That linear depression and laceration above the right ear,"
Vance suggested.</p>

<p>Quayne leaned over the body again for several moments. "I see
what you mean." He looked up at Vance significantly. "I'll know
more after the autopsy." He rose, frowning. "That's all now,
Lieutenant. I'll be getting along&mdash;I've several calls to
make."</p>

<p>"Thank you, doctor." O'Leary spoke courteously. "I'll attend to
the routine."</p>

<p>Quayne bowed and departed.</p>

<p>O'Leary looked at Vance shrewdly. "What about that depression
and laceration, sir?"</p>

<p>"Come with me a moment, Lieutenant." And Vance led the way to
the cliff above. He pointed to the dark stain by the shrub-oak
bole.</p>

<p>O'Leary inspected it and nodded slowly. Then he gave Vance a
steady look. "What's your theory, sir?"</p>

<p>"Must I? But it's only a vague idea, Lieutenant. Highly
illusory. That bash on Wallen's head might be from an instrument.
Doesn't fit with a tumble. The poor johnnie could have been hit
elsewhere and shoved over the cliff to cover up. There are faint
indications in the snow hereabouts, despite last night's wind.
Remote speculation at best. But there could have been three people
here last night. Marks not clear. No. Proof lackin'...My theory?
Wallen was struck near the Manor. Struck over the ear with an
instrument shaped&mdash;let us say&mdash;like the blunt end of a
spanner. His skull was fractured. Then he was dragged here. Two
faint lines up the slope. Heels, perhaps. The body was dropped to
the ground here so the other could hold to this tree while shoving
Wallen over the cliff. Hemorrhage from the nose and ears
intervened. Hence the blood here."</p>

<p>"I don't like it, sir." O'Leary frowned glumly.</p>

<p>"Neither do I. You asked for it."</p>

<p>O'Leary looked down at the telltale stain, then back at Vance.
"You'll help us, sir? I'd be flattered. No need pretending I don't
know of you."</p>

<p>"Disregardin' the compliment, I'd he happy to." Vance took out a
cigarette. "My sole interest Mr. Rexon. As I said."</p>

<p>"I understand. My thanks. I'll get the machinery going." O'Leary
strode off briskly.</p>

<p>When we returned to the Manor the sun was streaming into the
spacious glass-enclosed veranda which stretched across the entire
east side of the house. At the foot of a short terrace leading from
the veranda was a large artificially controlled skating rink, lined
on three sides with slender trees and landscaped gardens.
Immediately below, to the south, was a pleasant pavilion.</p>

<p>Joan Rexon reclined on the veranda in a tufted wheel-chair built
like a <i>chaise longue</i>; and beside her in a small wicker porch
chair sat Ella Gunthar. Vance joined them with a smile of greeting.
Joan Rexon was frail and wistful, but she gave little impression of
invalidism. Only the blue veins in her slender hands indicated the
long illness which had sapped her strength since childhood.</p>

<p>"Isn't it terrible, Mr. Vance!" Ella Gunthar said in a quavering
voice. He looked at her a moment questioningly. "My father has just
told us about poor Lief Wallen. You know, don't you?"</p>

<p>Vance nodded. "Yes. But we mustn't let that cast a shadow over
us here." He smiled to Joan.</p>

<p>"It's very difficult to avoid it," Miss Rexon said. "Lief was so
kind and thoughtful..."</p>

<p>"The more reason not to think of such things," Vance
declared.</p>

<p>Ella Gunthar nodded seriously. "The sunshine and the
snow&mdash;there <i>are</i> happy things in the world to think
about." She placed her hand tenderly over Joan's. But the thought
of the tragedy remained with her as well. "Poor Lief must have
fallen on his way home this morning."</p>

<p>Vance looked at her meditatively. "No. Not this morning," he
said. "It was last night&mdash;around midnight."</p>

<p>Ella gripped her chair, and a frightened look came into her
eyes. "Midnight," she breathed. "How terrible!"</p>

<p>"Why do you say that, Miss Ella?" The girl's manner puzzled
Vance.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;At midnight..." Her voice trailed off.</p>

<p>Vance quickly turned the conversation, but failed to alter the
girl's strange mood. At length he excused himself and went into the
house. He had barely reached the foot of the main stairs when a
hand was placed on his arm. Ella Gunthar had followed him.</p>

<p>"Are you sure it was&mdash;midnight?" Her whisper was tense and
pleading.</p>

<p>"Somewhere thereabouts." Vance spoke lightly. "But why are you
so upset, my dear?"</p>

<p>Her lips trembled. "I saw Lieutenant O'Leary come in with you
and go toward Mr. Rexon's den. Tell me, Mr. Vance, why is he here?
Is anything&mdash;wrong? Will we all have to go to
Winewood&mdash;to answer questions maybe?"</p>

<p>Vance laughed reassuringly. "Please don't trouble your lovely
little head. There'll be an inquest, of course&mdash;it's the law,
y' know. Just formality. But they'll certainly not ask you to
go."</p>

<p>Her eyes opened very wide. "An inquest?" she repeated softly.
"But I want to go. I want to hear&mdash;everything."</p>

<p>Vance was nonplused. "Aren't you being foolish, child? Run back
and read to Joan and forget all about&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you don't understand." She caught her breath sharply. "I've
<i>got</i> to go to the inquest. Maybe&mdash;" She turned suddenly
and hurried back to the veranda.</p>

<p>"My word!" murmured Vance. "What can possibly be in that child's
mind?"</p>

<p>On the upper landing, as we turned toward our rooms, the
housekeeper stepped out unexpectedly from a small corridor. She
drew herself up mysteriously.</p>

<p>"He's dead, isn't he?" Her tone was sepulchral. "And perhaps it
wasn't an accident."</p>

<p>"How could one know?" Vance was evasive.</p>

<p>"Normal things don't happen here," she ran on tensely. "Those
emeralds have put a curse on this house&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've been reading the wrong novels."</p>

<p>She ignored the implication. "Those green stones&mdash;they
create an atmosphere. They attract. They send forth temptation.
They radiate fire."</p>

<p>Vance smiled. "What do you find abnormal here?"</p>

<p>"Everything. Darling Joan is an invalid. Old Jed's a fanatical
mystic. Miss Naesmith brings strange people here. There's intrigue
and deep jealousies everywhere. Mr. Rexon wants to choose his son's
wife." She smiled inscrutably. "He doesn't know he's building on
sand. It all started years ago."</p>

<p>"You hear much, what?" Vance spoke satirically.</p>

<p>"And I see much. The Rexon dynasty is falling. Young Mr. Richard
pretends much; but the first night he got back from Europe a girl
was waiting for him in the rear hall back of the stairs. He took
her in his arms without a word and he held her close and long." She
came nearer and lowered her voice. "It was Ella Gunthar!"</p>

<p>"Really, now." Vance laughed indifferently. "Young love. Any
objection?"</p>

<p>The woman turned angrily and went down the hail.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br>
A WOMAN'S BARB</h2>

<p><b>(<i>Thursday, January 16; 4:30 p.m.</i>)</b>
</p>

<p>Vance deserted the Manor an hour later, just as the noonday
siren shrilled overhead, the surrounding hills catching the note
and throwing the echo back and forth much longer than the original
blast warranted. Carrington Rexon had long taken a boyish delight
in retaining this outmoded signal for his workmen. He admitted it
served no purpose, but it amused him to continue to use it.</p>

<p>The early winter dusk had begun to fall when Vance returned.</p>

<p>"Been snoopin' and talkin' round the estate," he told Carrington
Rexon, settling himself comfortably before the fire. "Much needed
activity. Hope you don't mind."</p>

<p>Rexon's laugh was mirthless. "I only hope your time wasn't
wasted."</p>

<p>"No. Not wasted. I'll be frank. You want it, I know."</p>

<p>Rexon nodded stiffly.</p>

<p>"Things not happy," summarized Vance. "Meanness at work. And
jealousies. Nothing overt. Just undercurrents. They could erupt,
however. Gunthar's hard on the men. That doesn't help...Hear you've
been planning to replace him as overseer. Wallen mentioned. Any
truth in that?"</p>

<p>"Frankly, yes. But I was in no hurry."</p>

<p>"Lief Wallen wanted to marry Ella. Both father and daughter
protested. Friction&mdash;scenes. Not nice. Much bitterness. Source
of general resentment of estate workers toward Miss Ella. Think she
considers herself superior to the rest of them because she's Miss
Joan's companion. Only Old Jed defends her. They answer he has
delusions and a soft spot for the color green. Implication bein'
the presence of the emeralds has affected him. Everyone adding fuel
to a smoulderin' fire and waiting for a flareup."</p>

<p>Rexon chuckled. "And perhaps you think, Vance, that I, too, am
affected with the rest."</p>

<p>Vance made a deprecating motion. "By the by, yours is the only
key to the Gem Room, what?"</p>

<p>"Good Heavens, yes! Special key and special lock. And a steel
door."</p>

<p>"Been in the room today?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Everything's quite in order."</p>

<p>Vance changed the subject. "Tell me about your housekeeper."</p>

<p>"Marcia Bruce? Solid as rock."</p>

<p>"Yes. I believe you. Honest, but hysterical."</p>

<p>Rexon chuckled again. "You've noticed much...But she adores
Joan&mdash;cares for her like a mother when Ella Gunthar is off
duty. Basically, Bruce is a fine woman. Quayne agrees. There's a
fellow-feeling between those two. She was superintendent of nurses
in a hospital once. Quayne's a worthy man, too. I'm glad to see
that friendship developing."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Vance smiled. "I perceive Squire Rexon is
sentimental."</p>

<p>"The human heart desires happiness for others as well as for
oneself." Rexon was serious now. "What else did you learn, Vance?
Anything pertaining to Lief Wallen's death?"</p>

<p>Vance shook his head. "Solution may come through irrelevancies.
Later. I've only begun." Then he went out to the drawing room.</p>

<p>Bassett sat at the table near the veranda door where we first
met him. He had just reached up and caught Ella Gunthar's arm as
she passed. He was smirking up at her unpleasantly. She drew away
from him. Bassett let her go. "Haughty, aren't we?" His eyes
followed her with a sardonic leer as she returned to Miss Joan.</p>

<p>Vance strolled up. "Not skiing today, Mr. Bassett? Thought the
whole jolly crowd was up on the Winewood trails."</p>

<p>"I slept too late and missed the party...Pretty blond thing,
that Ella Gunthar." His eyes drifted back to the veranda.
"Unusually attractive for a servant."</p>

<p>Vance's eyes narrowed, hard as steel, and drew Bassett's gaze.
"We're all servants. Some to our fellow men. Some to our vices.
Think that over." He went out to the veranda.</p>

<p>Lieutenant O'Leary was just coming up the steps at the side
entrance.</p>

<p>"Doctor Quayne's doing the autopsy now," he announced. "Inquest
tomorrow at noon. You'll have to attend, I'm afraid, sir. I'll pick
you up."</p>

<p>"Any complications ahead?" asked Vance.</p>

<p>"No. I've soft-pedaled everything. John Brander, our coroner, is
a good man. He likes Rexon. And I've explained the situation. He
won't ask embarrassing questions."</p>

<p>"Accident verdict, maybe?"</p>

<p>"I hope so, sir. Brander understands. It'll give us time."</p>

<p>"A pleasure to work with you, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>O'Leary went inside to see Rexon, and Vance strode to where Joan
and Ella Gunthar were sitting.</p>

<p>A noisy group of guests, returning from their skiing expedition,
came clattering up the terrace, passed us with cheery greetings,
and continued upstairs. Carlotta Naesmith and Stanley Sydes
remained on the veranda and joined us. Ella Gunthar was looking
about anxiously. "It's really no use, Ella," Miss Naesmith told her
satirically. "Dick's gone daffy over Sally Alexander."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it!"</p>

<p>Miss Naesmith's mouth twisted in a cruel smile. "Does it hurt,
Ella?"</p>

<p>"Carlotta! Cat!" There was no mirth in Sydes' reprimand.</p>

<p>"How do you feel today, Joan?" Miss Naesmith's mood changed as
the girl smiled up sweetly. "And you, too, Mr. Vance. Why didn't
you join the skiing party? It was glorious. At least ten inches of
powder over a deep base."</p>

<p>"Isn't there enough snow already in these locks of mine?"</p>

<p>"And most becoming, Sir Galahad!" She turned and stroked Sydes'
temple. "Wonder if Stan'll be handsome when he gets grey."</p>

<p>"I promise you, Goddess," declared Sydes, "I'll be unutterably
fascinating." He leaned over her. "And now, for the last
time:&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I always get seasick. I'll seek my treasure nearer home."</p>

<p>"Maybe I will too, if you spurn my invitation." Sydes' tone was
fretful and aggressive.</p>

<p>"What do you think this wild man wants, Joan?" Miss Naesmith
explained banteringly. "He insists I sail with him to Cocos Island
and go diving for the treasure of the <i>Mary Dear</i> in Wafer
Bay."</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be wonderful!" There pathetic longing in Joan
Rexon's voice.</p>

<p>"You dear, sweet child." The older girl's tone softened. Then
she went upstairs, and Sydes followed.</p>

<p>A while later Marcia Bruce came out. "You may run along home,
Ella. I'll take our darling in charge."</p>

<p>Vance rose.</p>

<p>"And I'll see Miss Ella home."</p>

<p>I knew he had great compassion for the girl who had no part in
the gay sophisticated life about her. And I knew why he wished to
walk with her to her father's cottage. He would strive to cheer and
amuse her, so that the sting of Miss Naesmith's words might be
forgot.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br>
THE INQUEST</h2>

<p><b>(<i>Friday, January 17; noon.</i>)</b>
</p>

<p>The coroner's inquest increased the tension of the situation.
Ella Gunthar had spoken urgently to Vance as soon as she arrived at
the Manor that morning. She was fully cognizant of the time and
place of the inquest and determined to be there. Vance sought to
dissuade her, but finally abandoned the effort. He realized there
was some deeper reason than mere curiosity, and arranged to take
her with us in O'Leary's car.</p>

<p>At the bend in the roadway where it joined the main highway
O'Leary signaled sharply on his horn. The sound found a prolonged
echo in the archaic midday siren reverberating over the estate and
weirdly following us like a mechanical nemesis as we drove on. The
Lieutenant offered assurances to Vance's unvoiced concern.</p>

<p>"It won't take us more than ten minutes to get there. Brander'll
wait for us."</p>

<p>The small room in the Town Hall at Winewood was well filled with
townspeople and workers from the Rexon estate; but there were no
guests from the Manor itself.</p>

<p>At one end of the room on a low platform was a long table at
which a heavy-set, red-faced man with blinking eyes presided.</p>

<p>"That's John Brander," whispered O'Leary. "A reasonable man.
Local real-estate lawyer."</p>

<p>At the left of the table, partitioned off by a railing, sat the
jury, simple and honest men of the conventional type one would
expect to find in a country town. A constable, with an ineffectual
air of importance, stood beside the witness stand.</p>

<p>Eric Gunthar was called first. He explained briefly how he had
come upon Lief Wallen's body on his way to work, and had returned
to the Gulch with Old Jed, Darrup and Vance. Under adroit
questioning, his trip to the summit of the cliff with Vance was
brought out; but when Gunthar became too voluble regarding the
blood spot, he was somewhat abruptly dismissed, and Darrup was
called. He appeared cowed and had little to add to Gunthar's
testimony. Old Jed proved a somewhat pathetic figure on the witness
stand, and Brander wasted no time on him.</p>

<p>Vance was called next. Brander's questions elicited largely
repetitions of the testimony already given; and despite the
coroner's obvious attempt at caution, the blood stain by the scrub
oak on the cliff was necessarily gone into at considerable length.
Brander seemed to attach no particular importance to it and
contrived a subtle suggestion that the blood might have been other
than human blood. I myself was conscious of a fleeting mental image
of some boy or amateur huntsman shooting a rabbit scurrying over
the snow.</p>

<p>"Were there footprints anywhere near the spot?" Brander
asked.</p>

<p>"No. No footprints," Vance answered. "There were, however, vague
impressions in the snow."</p>

<p>"Anything definite?"</p>

<p>"No." And Vance was permitted to step down.</p>

<p>Doctor Quayne was then sworn in. His dignity and soft manner
were impressive. The jury listened with patent respect. The
doctor's testimony was perfunctory and technical. He told of the
condition of the body when he first saw it; estimated the time of
death; and hastened over the findings of the autopsy. He
emphasized, however, the peculiar skull wound over Wallen's right
ear.</p>

<p>"Now, this skull wound, doctor," the coroner interposed. "Just
what was peculiar about it?"</p>

<p>"It was somewhat sharply outlined and depressed, running from
the right ear for about four inches toward the temple&mdash;not
exactly what one would expect from even violent contact with a flat
surface."</p>

<p>"There was snow where Wallen struck?"</p>

<p>"About an inch, I should say."</p>

<p>"Did you examine the ground under the snow for a possible
projection?"</p>

<p>"No. It would have been visible had it been there."</p>

<p>"But there are projecting rocks on the cliff between the upper
ledge and the ground, aren't there?"</p>

<p>"Slight ones. Yes."</p>

<p>"Is it not possible, then, Wallen's head glanced one of these
rocks in falling?"</p>

<p>Doctor Quayne pursed his lips. He expressed considerable
doubt.</p>

<p>"However," persisted Brander, "you couldn't say
definitely&mdash;could you, doctor&mdash;that this particular
injury was wholly incompatible with the fall?"</p>

<p>"No. I couldn't say that definitely. I merely state that the
injury seemed strange in the circumstances; one hardly to be
expected."</p>

<p>"But still,"&mdash;Brander leaned forward with marked
courtesy&mdash;"you'll pardon me, doctor, if I insist on the point.
Such an injury would have been <i>possible</i> in an accidental
fall from the cliff?"</p>

<p>"Yes,"&mdash;Doctor Quayne's tone showed annoyance&mdash;"it
would have been possible."</p>

<p>"That will be all, doctor. Thank you for your clarity and
help."</p>

<p>O'Leary was then called. His testimony, brief and businesslike,
served merely to corroborate that of preceding witnesses. As he
stepped down there came an unexpected and dramatic interlude. Guy
Darrup suddenly leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>"You ain't doin' fair to Lief Wallen, Mr. Brander," he shouted
righteously. "You ain't askin' for the things where truth lies. I
could tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Brander struck the table with his gavel. "If you have evidence
to give," he said with acerbity, "you should have stated it when
you were on the stand."</p>

<p>"You didn't ask me the right questions, you didn't, Mr. Brander.
I know plenty about poor Lief."</p>

<p>"Swear him in again, Constable."</p>

<p>"Not comfortin' for us," whispered Vance to O'Leary.</p>

<p>"Brander has no choice." O'Leary, too, was apprehensive.</p>

<p>Darrup took the oath a second time.</p>

<p>"Now give us your withheld evidence, Darrup." Brander's biting
tone was wasted.</p>

<p>"Maybe you don't know, Mr. Brander, the queer wrong things that
goes on over there at the Squire's." Darrup spoke like a zealot
aroused. "Mr. Gunthar's always a-bullyin'. An' he drinks too much
to suit the Squire. He's been warned, he has. An' it was Lief
Wallen that was gonna step in his boots&mdash;just like he stepped
in Old Jed's boots. An' Lief wanted to marry that pretty girl of
his&mdash;the one down there who looks after Miss Joan." Ella
Gunthar drew back as he pointed. "Lief had a right. He'da made her
a good honest husband. But Mr. Gunthar didn't want it. I guess he's
got his own ideas." Darrup contorted his lips into a shrewd smile.
"An' the girl didn't want it neither. She thinks she's better than
us. An' there's been plenty o' trouble about it all&mdash;Lief
wasn't a boy who'd give up easy..."</p>

<p>Darrup breathed noisily, and hurried on.</p>

<p>"But that ain't all, Mr. Brander&mdash;not by a long ways.
Nothing's right up there at the Squire's. There's funny things
goin' on. Deep, dark things&mdash;things you ain't taught about in
the Bible. What's the girl doin' down in the Green Glen at night
times, I'd like to know? I've seen her sneakin' to Old Jed's hut.
There's plottin'. Everybody's lyin'. Everybody's hatin'. An' Old
Jed's queer. He don't talk to nobody. But he's up to something,
always lookin' up at the trees, an' lettin' the stream water run
through his fingers, like a kid. An' then, just when young Lief's
about to step into Mr. Gunthar's job, he goes an' falls off the
cliff. Lief knew his way about the grounds better'n to do that.
Anyway, what's he doin' up there that time o' night when he's
supposed to be watchin' round the Manor?"</p>

<p>Brander's patience gave out. His gavel smashed down.</p>

<p>"Did you come here to vent your hates, man? That's not evidence.
That's old women's talk."</p>

<p>"<i>Not evidence!</i>" shrieked Darrup. "Then ask Mr. Gunthar's
girl why she was runnin' down the slope from the cliff at twelve
o'clock that night when Lief <i>fell over!</i>"</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"You heard me, you did, Mr. Brander. I was workin' late in the
pavilion, fixin' things for the Squire's party. An' here she comes
runnin' down the slope an' turned right by the pavilion. An' she
was cryin', too."</p>

<p>I looked at Ella Gunthar. Her face was white, her lips trembled.
There was a subdued commotion in the room. Brander hesitated,
looked uneasy. He rustled through some papers before him. Then he
looked angrily at Darrup.</p>

<p>"Your statements are irrelevant." He paused. "Unless,
perhaps,"&mdash; there was jocularity in his tone&mdash;"you're
accusing a mere girl of hurling a big fellow like Wallen over the
cliff. Is that what you mean?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Brander." Darrup lapsed again into sullenness. "It
wasn't her as could've done it. I'm only tellin' you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again the gavel descended. "That's enough! This inquest is not
for the purpose of injuring a young woman's reputation. It is
merely to establish by what means Wallen came to his death, and, if
by criminal means, at whose hand. Your speculations are, therefore,
not helpful to this investigation. Step down, Darrup." Darrup
obeyed, and Brander turned quickly to O'Leary. "Any more witnesses;
Lieutenant?"</p>

<p>O'Leary shook his head.</p>

<p>"That's all then." Brander spoke briefly to the jury. They filed
out. In less than half an hour their verdict was announced:</p>

<p>"We find that Lief Walton met his death by an accidental fall,
under suspicious circumstances."</p>

<p>Brander was startled. He opened his mouth, was about to speak,
but said nothing. The inquest was over.</p>

<p>"There's a verdict!" O'Leary scoffed to Vance as we drove back
to the Manor. "No sense whatever. But Brander did his best."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;oh, yes. Not strictly legal, perhaps. Could have been
worse. However..."</p>

<p>Ella Gunthar sat in the corner of the back seat beside me, a
handkerchief pressed to her mouth, staring, unseeing, over the
quiet winter landscape.</p>

<p>Vance took her gently in hand when we arrived. "Was Darrup
telling the truth, my dear?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean..."</p>

<p>"Were you running down the slope that night?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;No. Of course not." She raised her chin defiantly. "I
was at home at midnight. I didn't hear anything..."</p>

<p>"Why are you fibbing?" he asked sternly. She compressed her lips
and said nothing. Vance went on with tenderness. "Maybe I know.
You're a brave little soldier. But very foolish. Nothing's going to
hurt you. I want you to trust me." He held out his hand.</p>

<p>Her eyes searched his face a moment. A faint smile showed on her
lips. Then she placed her hand confidently in his.</p>

<p>"Now run along to Joan&mdash;and let that smile come all the way
out."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br>
SECRET PLANS</h2>

<p><b>(<i>Friday, January 17; evening.</i>)</b>
</p>

<p>That evening, shortly after dinner, I stood with Vance on the
veranda, looking out over the shadows on the skating rink. Echoes
of music and gaiety drifted out to this secluded corner from the
drawing room. Vance was in a serious, contemplative mood and smoked
a <i>R&eacute;gie</i> in silence, with a faraway expression.</p>

<p>Before long, however, there was the sound of approaching
footsteps behind us, and Vance turned to greet Carlotta
Naesmith.</p>

<p>"Brooding over your sins, Sir Knight?" the girl asked as she
came up, "It really doesn't help. I've tried it...I sought you out
to ask a most important question&mdash;tu-whit, tu-who: Do you
skate gracefully?"</p>

<p>"At my time of life!" Vance pretended dejection. "But your
query's flatterin'. I'm duly grateful."</p>

<p>"I was hoping you did skate. We do so need a Master of
Ceremonies." She prodded him playfully. "You are hereby
elected."</p>

<p>"It sounds interestin'. Explanat'ry instructions in order."</p>

<p>"It's like this," Miss Naesmith readily complied. "All the
inmates of the zoo, barring the decrepit, are throwing a party for
Richard tomorrow night. A sort of farewell celebration. It's to be
on the rink out there...I'm hostess <i>pro tem</i>, you know.
Originality expected from one so brilliant. Hence skates&mdash;that
being the best idea the brain could conjure up."</p>

<p>"Sounds jolly," said Vance. "And my duties?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just to keep things going. Be officious&mdash;you can.
Announce the animals. I'm sure you get it: every animal act has a
ringmaster."</p>

<p>"Must I supply liniment?"</p>

<p>"You wrong us, sir!" she chirped indignantly. "We all skate
amazingly well. I understand the bar will be temporarily
padlocked."</p>

<p>"That could help, y' know." Vance smiled. "We're planning it
quite seriously," she ran on. "We're even going to practice on the
lower rink tomorrow. And we're going to Winewood in the morning to
scout for costumes...Sounds a bit horrible, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" Vance protested. "Sounds jolly. As I said." He looked
at the girl searchingly. "Tell me, Miss Naesmith, why did you try
to hurt Ella Gunthar yesterday?"</p>

<p>Miss Naesmith's mood changed. Her eyes narrowed. She shrugged
noncommittally.</p>

<p>"It doesn't take both my eyes to see that she and Dick are
attracted to each other. They always were as kids."</p>

<p>"And Sally Alexander?"</p>

<p>She laughed without mirth. "Dick didn't speak to her all day.
But let Ella worry."</p>

<p>"And it doesn't take both my eyes"&mdash;Vance did not shift his
gaze&mdash; "to see that you will never pine away if Richard is
diverted."</p>

<p>She pondered that a moment. "Dick's a nice boy. It's Papa
Rexon's idea, you know. And who am <i>I</i> to upset his fondest
dream?"</p>

<p>"Is it nice to be bitter?" Vance brought out his cigarettes.
Miss Naesmith accepted one, and he lighted one himself.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's done in the best circles," the girl said facetiously.
"And anyway, it's not the man's place to walk out. That's <i>my</i>
prerogative."</p>

<p>"I see. Mere technique of etiquette at fault. Well, well."</p>

<p>The girl blew Vance a kiss and went back to the noisy drawing
room.</p>

<p>"As I thought," he murmured, as if to himself. "Neither wants
it. Richard makes the fact evident. <i>Ergo</i>, pique. Evinced by
a display of cruelty. Ancient feminine sequence. However, nice girl
at heart. It'll all arrange itself. Poor papa. Yes, the Rexon
dynasty is crumblin'. Same like Bruce predicts." He looked out over
the shadowy rink, drawing deeply on his <i>R&eacute;gie</i>. "Come,
I've a wishful idea." He spoke irrelevantly as he turned suddenly
and went inside.</p>

<p>We found Joan Rexon in her own sitting room across the hall. She
was on a divan by the window, and Marcia Bruce was reading to
her.</p>

<p>"Why aren't you in the drawing room, young lady?" Vance asked
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I'm resting tonight," the girl replied. "Carlotta told me
there's to be a big party for Dick tomorrow night, and I want to
feel well, so I won't miss any of it."</p>

<p>Vance sat down. "Would it tire you too much if I talked to you a
few minutes?"</p>

<p>"Why, no. I'd love it."</p>

<p>Vance turned to Miss Bruce. "Mind if I speak with Miss Joan
alone?"</p>

<p>The housekeeper rose in resentful dignity and went to the door.
"More mystery." Her tone was hollow. Her green eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite," laughed Vance. "A dark plot, in fact. But I can
complete my dire machinations in ten minutes. Come back then, what?
There's an angel."</p>

<p>The woman went without a word.</p>

<p>"I want to talk a moment about Ella." Vance drew up his chair
beside the slight reclining figure of Joan Rexon.</p>

<p>"Dear Ella," the girl said sweetly.</p>

<p>"She is a dear, isn't she?...I've wondered since I've been here
why I never see her on the rink. Doesn't she skate?"</p>

<p>Joan Rexon smiled sadly. "Oh, she used to love skating. But I
guess she's lost her interest&mdash;since I fell."</p>

<p>"But I know you love to see others skating and being happy."</p>

<p>She nodded. "I do. I do. I've never forgot what fun I used to
have myself. That's why Dad kept up the rinks and the pavilion. So
I can sit on the veranda and watch the others. He often brings
famous skaters up here just to perform for me."</p>

<p>"He'd do anything he thought would make you happy," said
Vance.</p>

<p>She nodded again, emphatically. "And so would Ella...You know,
Mr. Vance, I'm really a very lucky girl. And I do have wonderful
times just watching others do the things I'd love to do."</p>

<p>"That's why I thought Miss Ella might be doing your skating for
you, so to speak."</p>

<p>The girl turned her head slowly toward the window. "Maybe I'm to
blame, Mr. Vance. I've often thought that."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it," Vance urged softly.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, when I was a little girl, just after my
accident, Ella went out on the rink and skated&mdash;she was a
beautiful skater. I watched her and I was very selfish, I think.
Just the sight of her skating seemed to hurt me. I don't exactly
understand it. I was such a baby. It&mdash;it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand, my dear."</p>

<p>"And when Ella came back to the veranda I was crying...After
that, for several years, I saw Ella only at intervals. She was at
school, you know. And we never spoke again about her skating."</p>

<p>Vance took her hand gently. "She was probably too busy with
other things to keep up her skating. Or perhaps she lost interest
because you couldn't join her. You needn't feel guilty...But it
wouldn't hurt you any more, would it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no." She forced a smile. "I wish she <i>would</i> skate
again. I was just terribly foolish."</p>

<p>"We're all foolish when we're young." Vance laughed.</p>

<p>The girl nodded seriously. "I'm not foolish&mdash;that
way&mdash;any more. Now when I see some wonderful skater I wish it
were Ella. I know she could have done it."</p>

<p>"I know just how you feel." As he rose the door opened and
Marcia Bruce entered.</p>

<p>"The plot's concocted," said Vance. "And I'm sure I haven't
tired the young lady. She's quite ready to hear the ending of the
story you were reading to her."</p>

<p>As we came out again into the hail and approached the stairway
two figures stood conversing earnestly in a secluded nook at the
rear. They were Carlotta Naesmith and Stanley Sydes. Vance merely
glanced toward them and proceeded to the drawing room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br>
AN ABRUPT SUMMONS</h2>

<p><b>(<i>Saturday, January 18; forenoon.</i>)</b>
</p>

<p>The next morning Vance rose in good season and, after a hasty
cup of coffee, left the house, alone, disappearing down the wide
path which led past the pavilion to Gunthar's cottage. Shortly
after his departure the other guests straggled down to the
breakfast room and then assembled before the spacious gabled
garage. One by one the cars were brought out and the cavalcade
swung gaily up the hill to the main road and toward Winewood. Half
an hour or so later the housekeeper piloted Joan Rexon tenderly to
the now deserted veranda and with motherly attentions installed her
on the specially built <i>chaise longue</i> near the windows
overlooking the skating rink.</p>

<p>Barely was the girl settled when Vance and Ella Gunthar turned
the corner of the path by the pavilion and came toward the
house.</p>

<p>"You see, Miss Joan," Vance said as they entered, "not only do I
see your charming companion home in the evening, but I escort her
to you in the morning."</p>

<p>Ella Gunthar smiled. She seemed particularly happy. There was a
new sparkle in her eyes. Marcia Bruce, apparently sensing something
unusual, looked from Ella to Vance and back again. Then she rose,
patted Joan Rexon fondly, and went indoors.</p>

<p>Vance remained on the veranda a while, chatting in his most
trivial manner, and finally went inside to seek the comfort of the
easy chair in his room. He seemed preoccupied and lay back, smoking
listlessly for some time. His meditations, whatever they were, were
interrupted by a knock on the door. Lieutenant O'Leary came in and
sat down. There was an added sternness in his aquiline face.</p>

<p>"I wanted to see you alone, Mr. Vance. The butler said you were
here, so I took the liberty..."</p>

<p>"Delighted, Lieutenant." Vance rearranged himself in his chair
and lighted another <i>R&eacute;gie</i>. "I trust you haven't
brought disconsolate tidin's."</p>

<p>O'Leary fumbled with his pipe a moment without replying. When he
got it going he looked up.</p>

<p>"I wonder, sir, if, by any chance, you have the same idea I
have?"</p>

<p>"It could be." Vance's eyebrows went up questioningly. "What is
your thought?"</p>

<p>"I'm convinced I know who killed Wallen."</p>

<p>Vance lay back lethargically and studied the strong set face of
the man opposite.</p>

<p>"Amazin'!" he murmured. Then he shook his head. "No. No such
thoughts here. Mind a blank as to that. Anyway, thanks for your
confidence. Could you stretch it further?"</p>

<p>O'Leary, hesitant at first, now seemed eager to talk.</p>

<p>"I figure it this way, sir: I don't think Guy Darrup was lying
at the inquest yesterday."</p>

<p>"No. Not lying. Merely impulsive and ingenuous. A simple honest
mind ruled by zealous emotions. Indignations churned up in him, and
boiled over."</p>

<p>"Then you believe him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Quite. No alternative. Fact is, I'd done a spot of
spyin' around myself and already knew most of what he poured forth.
Not a pleasant situation here and abouts. But where's it criminal?
I need more guidance. Do you have it?"</p>

<p>"Here's how I've put it all together: Gunthar drinks too much
and is about to be discharged. Wallen's slated for the promotion.
That in itself is a good enough motive with rugged straightforward
natures. Gunthar has just such a nature. He's not subtle, and apt
to be cruel in his cups: he'd take the straight line&mdash;strong
and forthright&mdash; when perplexed with a problem. Now, add to
this motive the friction between him and Wallen regarding his
daughter's future. Wouldn't you say that would set the stage?"</p>

<p>"Granted." Vance nodded. "Opportunity even simpler. But
continue, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>"Exactly, sir. A fine opportunity. Gunthar knows the lay of the
land. He knows Wallen's habits and knows his weaknesses. What could
be easier for him than to inveigle Wallen to the cliff on some
pretext, bash him over the head, and throw him over into the
Gulch?...Miss Gunthar probably suspected her father's intent,
followed him secretly up the cliff, and, when the thing was done,
came running down, crying."</p>

<p>"And what could Gunthar hope to gain?" asked Vance
indifferently. "He would still be discharged."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know Wallen wasn't the only available man for the job.
Rexon can get a dozen others, given a little time. But I gather
Gunthar intended to give up his tippling&mdash;which is only of
recent origin&mdash; and insinuate himself again into Rexon's good
graces."</p>

<p>"But Gunthar was still drinking too much yesterday, I saw him
both before and after the inquest."</p>

<p>"That substantiates my theory," O'Leary declared. "He needed it
to buck him up&mdash;the experience is enough to undo a stronger
man."</p>

<p>"True," conceded Vance. "The point fits snugly. What else,
Lieutenant?"</p>

<p>"Gunthar threatened Wallen twice."</p>

<p>"Gossip?"</p>

<p>"Necessarily, of course. But I believe it's authentic enough.
It'll be sworn to by reliable witnesses."</p>

<p>"A clever analysis, Lieutenant," drawled Vance. "But not a
defense-proof case."</p>

<p>O'Leary showed resentment. "That's not all, sir." He pulled
himself forward in his chair. "Gunthar can't prove a satisfactory
alibi for the supposed time of the killing. He came into Murphy's
tavern at Winewood at ten o'clock that night. He was nervous and
drank more than usual. He left at about half-past eleven. It takes
nearly half an hour to walk here from Winewood. An hour later
Sokol, the druggist in Winewood, was driving home from a late party
and saw Gunthar crossing the meadow on the far side of Tor Gulch.
The man thought nothing of it at the time; but after the inquest he
figured the information might have some bearing, and told me about
it. True enough, Gunthar was headed for his cottage. But that isn't
the short cut from Winewood.&mdash;And it is the route he would
have taken if he'd first been to the cliff...Does that strengthen
my ease against Gunthar?" finished O'Leary doggedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, markedly," Vance readily agreed. "All rather
circumstantial, however, isn't it, Lieutenant?"</p>

<p>"That may be." There was a touch of bravado in his voice: a
satisfying sense of triumph over Vance. "But sufficient grounds for
arresting the man."</p>

<p>"Oh, tut, tut. I wouldn't do that." Vance was all mildness. "So
far you've done exceeding well, Lieutenant. You put things together
deuced cleverly. Why spoil it all by moving too precipitately? Tie
a few more ends."</p>

<p>"I don't intend to act speedily. I could do with a few more
facts."</p>

<p>"Exactly. A common need of mankind. I'll bear your theory in
mind. Maybe I'll be able to supply the missing facts. Credit all
yours."</p>

<p>O'Leary knocked out his pipe and rose. "I've several lines I'm
following quietly. But I thought I'd tell you which way they're
leading. I was hoping you might see things from my point of
view."</p>

<p>"I do," Vance assured him. "You've done well. Thanks again for
your confidence."</p>

<p>When O'Leary had shaken hands and gone, Vance crushed out his
cigarette and walked to the window.</p>

<p>"Deuce take it, Van," he said, "the man's too specious.
Speciousness. Curse of our modern age. He thinks straight, though.
Competent chap. All for the best. Not a nice theory. I hope he's
wrong."</p>

<p>An hour later Vance went below. The party that had driven off to
Winewood earlier had returned. We saw some of them in the lower
hall. From the drawing room came sounds indicating others
there.</p>

<p>Doctor Quayne was sitting with Joan Rexon and Ella Gunthar on
the veranda. He got up when he saw us and smiled.</p>

<p>"You come just in time, Mr. Vance," his pleasant voice greeted
us. "Now you can entertain the young ladies. I'll have to run away
in a few minutes to see some of my patients who need me much more
than Joan does. I dropped by to make sure she was strong enough for
the party tonight, and she doesn't need me at all. With the rest
last night and this beautiful mild weather, she's all in readiness
for the festivities."</p>

<p>"Anyway," Miss Rexon said, "I managed to keep you here an hour,
doctor."</p>

<p>"That was purely social, my dear Joan." He turned back to Vance.
"If all my patients were as charming as these two young ladies I'd
never complete my rounds. The temptation to remain and visit would
be greater than I could resist."</p>

<p>"Mr. Vance, is flattery supposed to be a cure?" Joan Rexon
seemed very happy.</p>

<p>"There can be no flattery where you are concerned," Vance
returned. "I know that Doctor Quayne means every word he says to
you."</p>

<p>Several of the guests came out, joined us a moment to make a
fuss over Joan Rexon, and then returned indoors. The midday siren
sounded. Bassett, too, I noticed, strolled out; but he merely
nodded and remained at the other end of the veranda. He sat down at
a small table and began a game of solitaire.</p>

<p>The doctor glanced at his watch. "Good Heavens! That was the
noon signal!" He gave the two girls a cordial bow. "You're both a
corrupting influence." He went quickly through the drawing-room
door. A few minutes later we saw him drive away.</p>

<p>We remained on the veranda for another half hour, relaxing in
the warm sunshine, and Vance entertained the girls with tales of
his travels in Japan. In the midst of his engaging narrative he
glanced toward the French doors just behind us. Excusing himself
suddenly, he hastened toward the door. As he stepped inside he
turned and beckoned me to follow.</p>

<p>Higgins was standing just by the entrance, his face like chalk,
his watery old eyes bulging. Fear and horror pervaded his entire
being as he clasped and unclasped his hands against his breast.</p>

<p>"Thank God you were here, Mr. Vance!" His voice quavered and the
words were barely audible. "I couldn't find Mr. Richard. Come
quickly, sir. Something terrible&mdash;" He moved swiftly toward
the rear of the main stairs and led us to Carrington Rexon's
den.</p>

<p>There, on the floor before the grate, lay the owner of Rexon
Manor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br>
THE MISSING KEY</h2>

<p><b>(<i>Saturday, January 18; 12:30 p.m.</i>)</b>
</p>

<p>Vance, down on one knee in a moment, cursorily examined the
coagulating trickle of blood behind Carrington Rexon's right ear.
He listened a moment to the labored breathing, then sought the
pulse. He turned the man's face toward the light, found it ashen
pale. He raised the upper eyelid of one eye; the eyeball was firm,
the pupil contracted. He touched the cornea with his fingertip. The
lids immediately compressed tightly.</p>

<p>"Not serious," Vance announced. "He's reacting now from
unconsciousness...I say, Higgins, summon the doctor immediately."
He loosened Rexon's collar and stock.</p>

<p>Higgins coughed.</p>

<p>"I phoned Doctor Quayne before I came out to you, sir.
Fortunately, he was at home, sir. He should be here directly."</p>

<p>"Stout fella, Higgins. Now, if you'll call Lieutenant
O'Leary&mdash;tell him to come here at once. Urgent. Explain, if
necess'ry."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Higgins picked up the telephone, put through the
call, and returned the receiver. "The Lieutenant says he'll be here
in ten minutes, sir."</p>

<p>Vance stepped to the window and opened it. Then he went to the
fireplace and added a fresh log. The crackling flames seemed to
dissipate the gloom that hung over the room. A knock on the door
was followed by the entry of Doctor Quayne, bag in hand.</p>

<p>"Good God! What's this!" He rushed to Rexon.</p>

<p>"Not too serious, doctor. No. Bad rap on the head." Vance moved
away a step. "He should be coming to. Every indication of return of
muscular tone. I found his pulse weak but regular. There was a
definite corneal reflex when I opened his eye. Unmistakable
resistance when I moved his head."</p>

<p>Quayne nodded and fussed with the wound. A low moan came from
Rexon. His eyes opened, glazed, unseeing. At an order from Quayne,
Higgins brought brandy. The doctor forced a stiff dose gently
between Rexon's lips. The prostrate man moaned again and closed his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Lucky I went home for lunch before continuing on my rounds..."
The doctor chatted casually as he proceeded to examine Rexon.
Finally he rose. "Everything quite in order," he finished
cheerfully.</p>

<p>Rexon's eyes opened again, almost clear now. He recognized Vance
and Quayne, attempted a smile, winced, and raised a hand to the
back of his head.</p>

<p>"We'll take care of that in a moment." Quayne was kindly
reassuring. Then, with Higgins' help, he placed Rexon on the sofa.
With deft fingers he dressed the wound, continuing his assurances
to the man.</p>

<p>While the doctor was thus busied, Lieutenant O'Leary came in.
Vance, in a low tone, gave him the details.</p>

<p>"May we put a query or two now?" Vance asked as the doctor
stepped away from the sofa.</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly," Quayne told him. "Mr. Rexon'll be quite
all right now."</p>

<p>Vance motioned Higgins from the room, and stepped to the sofa
with O'Leary.</p>

<p>"Now, what can you tell us, old friend?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I doubt if I can tell you anything, Vance." Rexon's voice was
low and husky, but it gained in volume as he continued. "I'd just
risen from my desk to ring for Higgins...I must have been struck
from behind." His hand moved to his head again. "The next thing I
knew, you and Quayne were with me."</p>

<p>"Any idea how long ago that was?"</p>

<p>"Only a vague one, I'm afraid." Rexon thought a moment..."But
wait! I think I heard the first notes of the siren before I lost
consciousness...Yes. I'm positive. I recall being annoyed because
it was so near twelve and my breakfast tray hadn't been removed.
It's usually taken out of my way by eleven. That's why I was going
to call Higgins."</p>

<p>"Had you been here in the den since you came down this morning,
sir?" O'Leary put in.</p>

<p>"More or less, yes, Lieutenant. But I was out of the room for a
few minutes once or twice."</p>

<p>"Had any one been here with you?" asked Vance.</p>

<p>"Yes. Bruce came in for instructions, as she usually does when
there are guests. And my son spent about a half hour with me.
Doctor Quayne here stepped in to say hello before he went out to
Joan. Sydes and Carlotta came in for a minute. Some of the other
guests did, too. I'll try to think back, if you want to know who
else."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;oh, no. Really doesn't matter." Vance stepped
back.</p>

<p>"Do you recall any feeling of giddiness when you first rose to
call Higgins?" the doctor asked. "Judging from the wound, I'd say
it was highly possible you hit one of the fire irons as you
fell."</p>

<p>"I don't see how," answered Rexon a bit nettled. "I wasn't
dizzy. The sensation was I was struck from behind."</p>

<p>"All! I see," said Quayne thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Rexon suddenly started forward, his eyes averted frantically. A
bunch of keys on a long chain dangled from his trousers pocket over
the edge of the divan. He caught the keys and sank back fumbling
with them hysterically.</p>

<p>"The key!" he gasped after a moment. "The Gem-Room key! God in
Heaven! It's <i>gone</i>!"</p>

<p>"Easy now, Rexon," admonished the doctor. "It can't be gone.
Look again&mdash;calmly."</p>

<p>Rexon ran his hands hopelessly through his pockets. O'Leary
searched vainly on the floor. Vance stepped from the room,
returning instantly to report that the Gem-Room door was safely
locked.</p>

<p>"Proves nothing!" exploded Rexon. "We must get in there at once.
I'll get the duplicate key."</p>

<p>He rose feebly as he spoke, and moved unsteadily across the
room. Snatching a priceless Rembrandt etching from the opposite
wall, he threw it carelessly aside. Then he pressed a small wooden
medallion, and a narrow panel shifted, revealing an oval steel
plate with a dial and knob. His nervous fingers managed a sequence
of turns&mdash;left and right and left again. Finally he pulled the
plate open and reached inside the hidden wall safe. He brought out
a key with a long slender shaft. Taking it from him, Vance led the
way through the hall.</p>

<p>He had a little difficulty fitting the key into the lock, but
finally succeeded and pushed the heavy steel door inward. Rexon
brushed past him excitedly and came to a sudden stop in the middle
of the famous Gem Room.</p>

<p>"They're gone?" His voice was little more than a hoarse whisper.
"The most precious part of my collection. <i>And</i>
Istar's&mdash;" His voice broke as he pointed spasmodically and
began to sway.</p>

<p>Quayne stepped to him immediately, and took his arm. "My dear
friend," he cautioned. He turned to us. "I'll take him back to the
den, gentlemen." He led Rexon from the room.</p>

<p>Vance closed the door after the two men, and locked it. Lighting
a cigarette, he moved leisurely through that interesting room, with
O'Leary following him in silence. The room was completely void of
furnishings except for the ebony carpet and the numerous
metal-bound glass cases along the walls. Emeralds of various shapes
and sizes, in exquisite and unique settings, were displayed against
white velvet backgrounds. In the corner to which Rexon had pointed
a case larger than the others had its front pane shattered. A
smaller case beside the large one was similarly broken. Both were
empty. But none of the other cases in the room seemed to have been
disturbed.</p>

<p>"Very mystifyin'," Vance murmured. "Only two cases broken."</p>

<p>"Probably didn't have time; hurried job," suggested O'Leary.</p>

<p>"Quite, Lieutenant. All indications pointin' thus...Wonder what
Istar has to do with it."</p>

<p>He stepped to the side window and forced the catch open. O'Leary
looked on as he examined the heavy criss-cross iron bars that
enclosed the entire window frame. Then they made a similar
inspection of the other window.</p>

<p>"My word! Here's something interestin', Lieutenant. Bit of
tamperin', what?" He directed O'Leary's attention to some peculiar
ragged scratches across three of the bars.</p>

<p>O'Leary's brows went up. "Whoever it was must've tried this
means of entry first and found it too cumbersome an undertaking. No
patience."</p>

<p>"Or," returned Vance, "an interruption occurred. Aborted
attempt. Could be. Let's toddle."</p>

<p>They reclosed the windows. Vance took another look about the
room before unlocking the unwieldy door.</p>

<p>In the den Doctor Quayne was attempting futilely to console
Rexon. "It's not as if they'd all been taken." Platitudes like
that. "Only a few pieces..."</p>

<p>"<i>Only a few pieces!</i>" repeated Rexon despairingly. "The
very pieces that matter! If they'd taken all the others and left me
those&mdash;" He did not complete the sentence.</p>

<p>Vance handed Rexon the key. "I've relocked the door, of course.
Now tell us just what is missing. And how is Istar mixed up in
it?"</p>

<p>Rexon jerked himself up in his chair; leaned wearily against the
desk. "Every unset stone I owned. Spent a lifetime collecting
'em."</p>

<p>"Those would be the easiest to dispose of, I take it," observed
O'Leary respectfully.</p>

<p>"Yes. Exactly. A fortune for any one into whose hands they came.
All but the Istar..."</p>

<p>"Again, wherefore Istar?" persisted Vance.</p>

<p>"Queen Istar's necklace," groaned Rexon. "The rarest piece in my
collection. From Egypt&mdash;eighteenth dynasty. It can never he
replaced. Six high cabochon emeralds of flawless cut on a chain of
smaller stones set in silver and pearls...You must remember it,
Vance."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. Of course," said Vance sympathetically. "Naughty
queen&mdash; Istar. Always poppin' in and out to annoy folks."</p>

<p>O'Leary was making notes in a small book. "When were you last in
the room?" asked Vance.</p>

<p>"This morning, early. I go in every morning. Had Bruce there
with me to do a little dusting. For the display to my guests this
evening."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. Very sad. Now, of course, there'll be no display."</p>

<p>"No." Rexon shook his head in keen disappointment.</p>

<p>"But the youngsters must have their party tonight as though
nothing had happened. You agree, Rexon?" Vance's tone was
significantly imperative.</p>

<p>"Yes, by all means," complied Rexon. "No need to upset
everybody."</p>

<p>The doctor rose presently, picked up his bag. "You don't need my
services any more just now, Rexon. Wish I could be more helpful.
But I'll be back this evening to keep an eye on Joan for you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Quayne. That's very good of you."</p>

<p>The doctor bowed himself out.</p>

<p>O'Leary closed his notebook. "Tell me, Mr. Rexon, was your
overseer in to see you this morning?"</p>

<p>"Gunthar? No," replied Rexon. "He's probably been working on the
rink and the pavilion all morning. But it's strange you should ask
that. Higgins told me when I came down this morning that Gunthar
had been here about half an hour earlier asking if he could see me.
Higgins told him I wasn't down yet, and the man went away grumbling
to himself. I don't understand it, for he never comes here unless I
send for him."</p>

<p>O'Leary nodded with satisfaction. He stepped to the open window,
lowered it and raised it again. Then he leaned out for a moment as
if inspecting the flagging below. There was a speculative look in
his eyes as he rejoined us.</p>

<p>In the hall Vance drew the Lieutenant aside. "What about
Gunthar?" he asked in a low tone. "Any secrets to unbosom?"</p>

<p>"It's a clearer-cut case now than it was yesterday." The
Lieutenant was solemn. "You admitted I had a good case then, sir.
But add this to it: I tried to see Gunthar this morning. One of the
workmen told me he had gone to the Manor to speak to the Squire.
Seemed natural. So I waited around a while. But Gunthar didn't come
back."</p>

<p>O'Leary cocked a triumphant eye at Vance.</p>

<p>"You see, sir, how easy it would have been for the man to have
entered the den through the window, either then or later when Mr.
Rexon was out of the room. He had only to wait back of the screen
till the time was ripe. When he had struck the blow it would have
been a moment's work for him to snatch the key and get to the Gem
Room."</p>

<p>Vance nodded. "Deuced clever, Lieutenant. Logical from many
points of view."</p>

<p>"Yes. And what's more," persisted O'Leary, "I'm not at all
convinced his daughter Ella wasn't mixed up in it&mdash;you know,
sir, like giving him the tip-off&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear fellow! You startle me no end. I say, aren't you
carrying this prejudice against Gunthar a bit too far?"</p>

<p>O'Leary looked surprised that Vance apparently could not
appreciate the circumstantial possibilities of the situation.</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't say so," he retorted with the calmness of
conviction. "I've got enough to arrest the girl along with her
father."</p>

<p>"But on what grounds, Lieutenant?" Vance was concerned.</p>

<p>"As a material witness, if nothing else," was O'Leary's
confident rejoinder.</p>

<p>Vance lighted a cigarette and blew a long ribbon of smoke. "Not
attemptin' to try your case, Lieutenant. No. It's far too logical.
Merely making an urgent request. Neither the girl nor papa is
likely to run off tonight, what? Surely, tomorrow will serve your
purpose quite as well. You'll wait, Lieutenant? I'm beggin'."</p>

<p>O'Leary studied Vance several moments. There was no denying the
look of admiration beneath his perturbation and doubt. Finally he
nodded. "I'll wait, sir. Though it goes against my best judgment."
And he strode off across the veranda and disappeared down the side
steps.</p>

<p>Vance, too, stepped out on the veranda a moment later. Joan
Rexon still sat where we had left her, but Ella Gunthar was no
longer there. In her place sat Carlotta Naesmith.</p>

<p>"My word!" murmured Vance. "No use hopin' the doughty Lieutenant
didn't note Miss Ella's absence. No. Observin' fellow,
O'Leary."</p>

<p>Bassett was still hunched over the table where he had started
his game of Canfield. Stanley Sydes had joined him and sat in a
chair opposite, acting as banker. A decanter of Bourbon stood
between them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br>
FAREWELL SOIR&Eacute;E</h2>

<p><b>(<i>Saturday, January 18; 9 p.m.</i>)</b>
</p>

<p>The afternoon had passed uneventfully. After lunch Carlotta
Naesmith and Stanley Sydes invited Vance to go with the others and
watch their practice routine on the ice. He had politely declined.
Richard Rexon, who likewise remained at the Manor, had talked
briefly with Vance regarding the stolen emeralds and spent the rest
of the afternoon brooding about the matter. Miss Joan retired to
her sitting room for a rest. The house was unusually quiet.</p>

<p>At dinner there was excited talk about the party. Especially
were there mysterious hints of a surprise performer whom Mr. Rexon
had invited for the occasion. No one seemed to have any specific
information, however.</p>

<p>Dinner over, the older guests assembled on the veranda, grouping
themselves on either side of Miss Joan's <i>chaise longue</i> at
the center window. The night was clear and not too cold.</p>

<p>Shortly before nine Marcia Bruce brought Miss Joan out to her
place.</p>

<p>"Please pull up a chair for Ella beside me," the girl requested.
"She should be here any minute now."</p>

<p>Miss Bruce complied.</p>

<p>Doctor Quayne came up. After a word of encouragement to Miss
Joan and a greeting to Richard, he seated himself beside Carrington
Rexon behind the young people. Jacques Bassett stood against the
closed doors at the rear. Lieutenant O'Leary unobtrusively found a
place for himself.</p>

<p>A high, old-fashioned phonograph was wheeled out to the rink by
Higgins and another servant. A box of records was carried down.</p>

<p>Vance, on skates, in immaculate evening attire, with a white
muffler at his throat, appeared on the rink. Additional lights were
turned on as he came forward.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he began in mock ceremonious style. His
voice was clear and resonant. "I have been honored with the
privilege of conducting this memorable event. I confidently promise
you an evening of most unusual regalement."</p>

<p>General applause greeted his statement.</p>

<p>"We have with us tonight," he proceeded with exaggerated
formality, "performers of wide renown. I might even say, of
world-wide renown. Most of you, I am sure, will recognize each name
as it is announced..."</p>

<p>Another round of applause drowned out his next words.</p>

<p>"The first of our guest stars," he resumed, "is Miss Sally
Alexander. She will entertain you in her own incomparable
manner."</p>

<p>Miss Alexander came up from the pavilion, a smiling urchin in
colorful tatters, skating gracefully into the spotlight thrown from
an upper window of the Manor. She sang a gay Parisian chansonette
of dubious significance, and was rewarded with much laughter and
cheering. Her next number was a monologue depicting an intoxicated
celebrity attempting to thread his way through a bevy of admiring
debutantes. Skates made the task none too easy. The small audience
was genuinely amused, their approval long and loud.</p>

<p>Vance assisted the young woman back to the pavilion and returned
with Dahlia Dunham and Chuck Throme, both in trunks and jerseys.
They skated into the spotlight and made a deep bow. Vance raised
the young woman's hand.</p>

<p>"On my right, wearing red trunks," he announced, "is Miss Dahlia
Dunham&mdash;a most charmin' battler, with many a vict'ry to her
credit. On my left, in white trunks, is Jocky Throme, with a list
of wins quite as impressive. The two will now go through three
rounds for the skate-weight championship."</p>

<p>The gloves were put on, the seconds waved away; the referee came
forward, and the bout started. The two contenders sparred lightly
for a few seconds. They went into a clinch and were separated by
the referee. The slippery ice under their skates sent many of the
punches far afield. Those that connected did little damage. When
Vance blew his whistle at the end of the third round Miss Dunham
was declared the winner by popular acclaim. Chuck Throme, taking
his defeat gallantly, essayed another bow. As on an earlier
occasion, he carried the obeisance too far. His skates slid out
from under him. He lay prone on the ice. Vance and Miss Dunham
assisted him to his feet and helped him from the rink.</p>

<p>Joan Rexon sat up and looked about. "I wish Ella would come," I
heard her say. "She's missing all the fun. Have you seen her,
Dick?"</p>

<p>Richard Rexon shook his head glumly. "Maybe she's outside
somewhere." He went to investigate.</p>

<p>Next Miss Maddox and Pat McOrsay presented a skit with a
homemade miniature plane on runners. This was followed by Vance's
announcement of Miss Naesmith's number with Stanley Sydes. In
Spanish costume they creditably performed a series of dances to the
accompaniment of the records Vance placed on the phonograph. The
other performers joined them for the final tango. Richard Rexon had
returned to the disconsolate Joan.</p>

<p>"And now," came Vance's voice again, "We have a surprise for
you. I can't give you the name of this performer because she is
practically unknown. We call her the Masked Marvel...But one
moment! I must whisper in our maestro's ear what melody he is to
play." He pantomimed comically to the phonograph as he put on a new
record. The lovely strains of <i>Geschichten aus dem Wiener
Wald</i> came floating over the still night. And then...</p>

<p>A petite figure came tripping out on the ice with unbelievable
ease and rhythm. Her costume of velvet and sequins shimmered gaily
in the lights. A silk mask covered most of her face. Her spaced
routine was exquisitely performed. With incredible grace she
combined the most difficult school figures with spirals, spins, and
jumps of daring originality.</p>

<p>Everyone gasped with delight. There was a remark that it must be
Linda H&ouml;ffler, the newest skating sensation. Some of the
guests questioned Miss Joan and young Rexon. They disclaimed all
knowledge. Carrington Rexon, when asked what famous importation he
had bagged for the event, would give no information.</p>

<p>Each time the girl left the rink the applause was so loud and
continuous that Vance had to bring her back.</p>

<p>Finally one voice called out, "Remove the mask!" The cry was
taken up in unison. Vance whispered to the girl at his side. She
permitted him to take the mask from her face. Smiling happily, Ella
Gunthar stood before us.</p>

<p>Joan Rexon arose in triumphant delight. "I knew it was Ella!"
She was almost in tears. "I always knew Ella could do it. Isn't she
marvelous, Richard?"</p>

<p>But young Rexon was already on the terrace steps, making his way
to the rink. Carrington Rexon and the doctor stepped to Miss Joan's
side.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dad!" the girl exclaimed. "Why didn't you tell me?"</p>

<p>"It's as much a surprise to me as it is to you, my dear. Mr.
Vance told me merely he had arranged something for you. I had no
idea it was a surprise like this."</p>

<p>"All right, now. All right," Quayne put in admonishingly. "I
think that's enough for this evening, Joan." The two men helped the
girl indoors.</p>

<p>A noisy circle surrounded Ella Gunthar on the rink. The workmen,
having been permitted to witness the performance, now moved off.
The guests withdrew indoors.</p>

<p>Later they gathered in the drawing room. The performers came up
from the pavilion, still in their costumes. Vance, showered with
congratulations, disclaimed all credit.</p>

<p>"It's all Miss Naesmith's doing, I assure you," he told
everyone.</p>

<p>Ella Gunthar came in, escorted by Richard Rexon. She was
enthusiastically greeted on all sides. She seemed upset and nervous
and remained only long enough to embrace Miss Joan and say a few
words to her. Young Rexon's and Vance's offers to see her home were
refused with polite determination. She hurried away alone.</p>

<p>The phonograph was brought back from the rink. Someone wound it
up and started a record. Soon dancing began. Quayne brought the
housekeeper in and directed her to get Miss Joan off to bed. The
woman had a new look of pride about her and was almost cheerful as
she took charge of the girl and led her from the room.</p>

<p>The gaiety of the party increased. Only Jacques Bassett sat
morosely by himself. Quayne was about to approach him, but was
buttonholed by Miss Naesmith with a request for the best antidote
to seasickness. Richard Rexon joined Bassett at his table.</p>

<p>Vance had had enough. He bade his host good night. O'Leary came
up with a questioning look. But Vance put him off.</p>

<p>"Let's sleep on it, Lieutenant," he said. "Come round before
noon...Jolly party, what?...Cheeri-o."</p>

<p>O'Leary watched sullenly as Vance mounted the stairs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br>
QUEEN ISTAR'S NECKLACE</h2>

<p><b>(<i>Sunday, January 19; 9:30 a.m.</i>)</b>
</p>

<p>Vance rose early again Sunday. After strong coffee he invited me
to stroll with him in the clear winter sunshine. Snow had fallen in
the early hours of the morning; the world about us was covered with
a fresh white blanket. We took a footpath that led down to the
small pond in the Green Glen where we had first come upon Ella
Gunthar. As we skirted a high bush at one end of the pond a small
cabin came into view.</p>

<p>"The Green Hermit's cottage, I'll warrant," commented Vance.
"Sabbath morn visit to the druid in order."</p>

<p>The door was slightly ajar. Vance rapped. There was no response.
He pushed the door wide open. At a small table near a window sat
Old Jed. He looked up without surprise.</p>

<p>"Good morning," Vance said pleasantly from the threshold. "May
we come in?"</p>

<p>The old man nodded indifferently. His attention was focused on
some object between his fingers. As we approached him he raised his
hands. The sun fell full on a dazzling necklace of emeralds.</p>

<p>"Six cabochons on a chain of smaller stones," said Vance half to
himself. Then admiringly to the old man: "Lovely, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Old Jed smiled with childish delight as he let the green stones
slide between his fingers.</p>

<p>Vance sat down beside him. "What else have you?"</p>

<p>Old Jed shook his head.</p>

<p>"What did you do with the others?"</p>

<p>"No others. Only this." He spread the necklace on the table,
inviting Vance to share his ecstasy. "Like the green meadows in
springtime," he said mystically. "Like running streams of
water&mdash; like God's trees in summer:&mdash;green, all beauty in
nature is green." His eyes shone fanatically.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Vance, falling in with his mood. "Spring...the green
of nature all about:</p>

<p>'And all the meadows, wide unrolled,<br>
Were green and silver, green and gold.'"</p>

<p>He looked up kindly.</p>

<p>"Find it, Jed?"</p>

<p>A shake of the head from the old man. "Where did you get
it?"</p>

<p>Another shake of the head. "You're a friend of Miss Ella?" the
hermit asked as if eager to change the subject.</p>

<p>"Yes. Of course. And you are too."</p>

<p>The grey head bobbed enthusiastically up and down. "But that
fellow Mr. Richard brought home with him. Are you a friend of
his?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Bassett? No. No friend of his. Far from it...What about
him?"</p>

<p>"No good," declared Old Jed with strict economy of words.</p>

<p>Vance raised his brows slightly. "Did he give you that green
necklace?"</p>

<p>"No!" The old man was petulant. "He came here to make trouble
for Miss Ella."</p>

<p>"Really, now! When was that?"</p>

<p>"He came here last night. Before the swell doin's up at the big
house. He thought Miss Ella was alone. But I saw him." Old Jed
cackled. "Now he won't come here no more."</p>

<p>"No? Why not?"</p>

<p>"He won't come no more," repeated the other vaguely..."But up at
the big house, Mister: you'll take care of Ella?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," promised Vance. "She'll be all right...But tell me,
Jed; how did you get that trinket?"</p>

<p>The old man looked back at him in blank silence.</p>

<p>Vance tried strategy. "It's for Miss Ella's sake I must
know."</p>

<p>"Miss Ella, she doesn't do anything bad."</p>

<p>"Then tell me where you got that necklace," persisted Vance.</p>

<p>The old man looked about him in perplexity. His eyes came to
rest on the small phonograph we had seen Ella Gunthar using. He
looked up at Vance triumphantly. "There!" He pointed to the
instrument.</p>

<p>Vance rose and brought it to the table. He opened it up and
shook it, but without disclosing anything untoward. The old man
picked up the necklace, placed it on the green felt base.</p>

<p>"So," he said simply. "It was hidden there when I found it."</p>

<p>Just then the door was pushed wide open again. Ella Gunthar
stood there, a smile fading from her lips as she saw us. Old Jed
stood up to greet her. Vance stepped across the room, took the girl
gently by the hand, and led her to the table. Her glance fell on
the open phonograph with the string of gems sparkling inside.
Abruptly she turned away, her face white.</p>

<p>"How much do you know about this, Miss Gunthar?" Vance asked
indulgently.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;anything about it." Her answer was low and
hesitant.</p>

<p>"But you've seen it before?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;think so. In the Gem Room."</p>

<p>"How did it happen to be hidden in your little music box? Jed
says he found it there."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know. Maybe it's not real."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's real enough, my dear."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about it," she repeated stubbornly.</p>

<p>"Now. I think you're fibbing again. Do you know that just such a
necklace, and many other costly stones, are missing from the Gem
Room?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "Richard told me last night."</p>

<p>"Did Richard give you this?"</p>

<p>"No!" She glared at Vance indignantly. "And Jed doesn't know
anything about it either. And neither does my father! Oh, you're
all trying to pin lies on father&mdash;don't you think I know why
that police officer from Winewood is always hanging around the
estate?" Her words came in a passionate rush.</p>

<p>Vance watched the unhappy girl appraisingly. "Who, then, my
dear, do you think took the emeralds?" he asked calmly.</p>

<p>"Who?&mdash;who?" she echoed. She bit her lips. She thought for
several moments. Then, as if on sudden impulse, she blurted
defiantly: "<i>I</i> took them&mdash;<i>I</i> took them, of
course!"</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> took them!" Vance repeated skeptically. "What else
did you take besides the Istar necklace, Miss Ella?"</p>

<p>"I don't know just what&mdash;some loose stones."</p>

<p>"How did you get into the Gem Room?"</p>

<p>"I found the door unlocked."</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, Miss Ella. Mr. Rexon's not in the habit of
leaving the Gem-Room door unlocked."</p>

<p>"I found it unlocked," she insisted.</p>

<p>"And once inside the room, what did you do?" "I opened two of
the cases."</p>

<p>Vance laughed softly. "You found those unlocked, too?"</p>

<p>She drew up with a start. Tears formed in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Then I&mdash;I&mdash;broke them," she stammered.</p>

<p>"I see, Miss Ella. Then you won't mind coming with me to the
Manor to tell Mr. Rexon all about it?"</p>

<p>"No." She swallowed hard. "I won't mind."</p>

<p>Old Jed looked from Vance to the girl and back to Vance. He
furrowed his brow in an attempt to concentrate.</p>

<p>"Mr. Vance," the girl asked timidly, "will Miss Joan have to
know about it? And&mdash;and&mdash;Richard?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so," said Vance. "But perhaps not at once, my dear.
Are you ready to go?"</p>

<p>Vance pocketed the necklace and accompanied the girl from the
cabin. Again he took the footpath by which we had come. He made no
further mention of the missing gems. Instead he asked: "Bassett
been making himself objectionable again?"</p>

<p>She kept her eyes straight ahead. "It was nothing...Did Jed tell
you?...I never saw Jed so angry. I think Mr. Bassett was really
frightened."</p>

<p>The rest of the walk was in silence.</p>

<p>Carrington Rexon was alone in the den. Ella Gunthar entered the
room as Vance held the door for her. She stepped to one side and
stood shyly with her back against the wall. Vance indicated a
chair. The girl looked from him to Rexon and came forward.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear," prompted Vance as she sat down.</p>

<p>She lowered her eyes, gripped the sides of the chair.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rexon, I&mdash;" She raised her head and then spoke very
quickly. "I took the emeralds."</p>

<p>"You <i>what</i>?" Rexon asked in astonishment.</p>

<p>"I took the emeralds," she repeated more slowly.</p>

<p>Rexon laughed bitterly in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"I can prove it!" she declared recklessly. She extended her hand
to Vance for the necklace. He brought it out, gave it to her. She
placed it diffidently on the desk beside her.</p>

<p>Rexon took it up eagerly, looked at it carefully. "The Istar
necklace! Ah!" Then shrewdly: "Where are the rest?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. "I won't tell you. I won't!" Her
compressed lips indicated unmistakably that she would say no
more.</p>

<p>Rexon leaned back in his chair and studied the girl critically.
Then crisply: "And you're the girl my son wants to marry!"</p>

<p>Ella Gunthar's face suddenly flushed. Rexon's words had startled
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, my dear young lady," Rexon continued coldly. "You
didn't think I knew of the affair that's been going on between you
and Richard. Miss Naesmith told me about it only last
night&mdash;Miss Naesmith, the girl I hoped would be his
wife...Bah! After all I've done for you! You're not content to
steal the love of my only son. You must take my emeralds too." He
half rose in his anger. "I'm almost glad this thing has happened.
It will be well worth the loss of the emeralds if I can save
Richard..."</p>

<p>Vance stepped swiftly round the desk and put his hand on the
older man's shoulder. "My dear old friend, please! Don't turn a
disappointment into a tragedy."</p>

<p>Rexon relaxed under the persuasive pressure of Vance's hand.</p>

<p>Tears flooded Ella Gunthar's eyes. Vance came to her side.</p>

<p>"Poor child," he said soothingly, "don't you think this tragic
farce has gone far enough? It's time for the truth now&mdash;all
the truth you know. We're in the dark. We want your help. Some
terrible forces are at work in the Manor here. Some dangerous
criminal perhaps. You can help those you love only by telling us
the truth. Will you?"</p>

<p>She took a deep breath, dried her eyes. "Yes, I will," she said
with unexpected determination.</p>

<p>Vance sat down beside her. "Then tell me first: Whom are you
trying to shield with this foolish tale of theft?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know exactly. But it seemed that everyone I
love had suddenly been caught in an awful trap. Poor Jed, whom you
caught with the necklace; my father, whom I knew that police
officer suspected of all sorts of things; and, somehow,
Richard...And it was all mixed up in some horrible way with that
night on the cliff when poor Lief was killed. I&mdash;I&mdash;it
was all confusion. And it seemed that only I could help."</p>

<p>She buried her face in her hands, but when she looked up again
her eyes were still dry.</p>

<p>"And I had to try to help them without knowing how to go about
it; for I <i>really</i> didn't know...Only little things, here and
there, that didn't seem to fit together."</p>

<p>"You poor child," murmured Vance again. "But please tell us what
you do know&mdash;all the little things&mdash;anything that may
come to your mind. Maybe it will help us all&mdash;especially those
you love most."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll try! I'll try!" She spoke eagerly and braced herself.
"Perhaps you think, Mr. Vance, that I insisted on going to the
inquest Friday merely as an overcurious child."</p>

<p>"No," returned Vance. "Naturally, I've pondered the point. But
no opinion."</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, you know all that I heard there. I think that
jury was just anxious to get a bad job off their hands." (I could
see that Vance was amazed at the sagacity indicated by her remark.)
"And I've heard other things, too, Mr. Vance. I've heard the
workmen saying it's strange that my father should have been the one
to find Lief Wallen's body. ...Guy Darrup is still saying I should
have married Lief.&mdash;Can a girl help it if she doesn't love a
man?&mdash;Then I've heard my father say it's strange that Jed
should have known just which way to go that morning. Jed, who
wouldn't harm a fly!...I've heard that my father wasn't home at
midnight on the night Lief died, and that it made things look
pretty dark for him...Well, <i>I</i> wasn't at home at midnight
either! Does that mean <i>I</i> killed Lief Wallen?..."</p>

<p>She broke off.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry if I sound all mixed up," she resumed. "But it's
because I feel all mixed up...A little before twelve that night I
came here. Richard asked me to. We hadn't had a chance to speak
alone together all day. We were to meet at a favorite tree we have
up behind the pavilion. I waited and waited. But Richard didn't
come. And then I heard him talking to somebody.&mdash;He was angry,
I think. But he must have gone back inside. That's when I went
running down past the pavilion crying. Just as Guy Darrup said I
did. But he didn't know the reason."</p>

<p>She paused and looked at Vance, then at Rexon.</p>

<p>"Anything more?" Vance gave her a searching glance.</p>

<p>"Haven't I said enough?" Her voice sounded weary.</p>

<p>"You haven't told us where you got the necklace."</p>

<p>"Must I?"</p>

<p>"It might help to clear up a deucedly involved situation, don't
y' know."</p>

<p>"All right. But my father didn't take it!" She looked defiantly
at Rexon. "I found it lying on the floor near the window in the
dressing room reserved for me at the pavilion last night. I was
going to return it to Mr. Rexon. But then Richard told me what had
happened. I was afraid I'd be asked questions. I knew father was in
the pavilion yesterday. Jed brought my costume up there for me.
Father locked the room&mdash;to keep the surprise&mdash;and gave me
the key. I was afraid to do anything with the necklace until I had
time to think what would be best. And that's why I took it to Jed's
cabin and hid it in my little music box...But my father didn't take
it! And Old Jed didn't take it either!..."</p>

<p>Carrington Rexon looked profoundly disturbed and perplexed.
Vance placed his hands on Ella Gunthar's shoulders and was about to
raise her from the chair.</p>

<p>A knock on the door was followed by Higgins ushering in
Lieutenant O'Leary with a plainclothes man in his wake.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br>
THE SECOND MURDER</h2>

<p><b>(<i>Sunday, January 19; 11 a.m.</i>)</b>
</p>

<p>O'Leary looked from Vance to the girl in the chair and then at
the necklace spread on the desk before Rexon.</p>

<p>"Where did that come from, sir?" he inquired bluntly.</p>

<p>Vance briefly repeated the girl's account of the finding of the
necklace.</p>

<p>"A likely story." O'Leary's tone was sarcastic...</p>

<p>The telephone rang. Rexon answered. Then: "It's from New York,
Vance&mdash;for you. Private line, this. Perfectly safe. Go ahead."
He pushed the instrument across the desk.</p>

<p>O'Leary drew his officer aside and spoke earnestly to him while
Vance was at the telephone.</p>

<p>"...What caused the delay, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>Vance was saying. "Ah, records in Washington...I see...take it
word for word..." He reached for paper and pencil. He wrote out a
dictated message. I recognized the excitement under his calm
demeanor as he worked quickly. "Thorough as always, Sergeant." He
spoke with satisfaction as he threw down the pencil. "That gives me
just what I need...No. Not necess'ry for you to come. Many
thanks..."</p>

<p>He pushed the phone back and stood up. He sighed. He folded the
message he had written out, and placed it in his pocket. He sat
down again and lighted a <i>R&eacute;gie</i>. "Well,
Lieutenant?"</p>

<p>O'Leary came back to Ella Gunthar's chair. "I've kept my promise
to you, sir." He was calm, unofficious. "I've waited, as you asked
me to. Now I have no choice but to arrest this girl and her father.
I think you will agree, sir. I brought this man for the purpose."
He hesitated. "Unless you have additional information that will
alter my decision."</p>

<p>"I think I have, Lieutenant." Vance turned to the girl in the
chair. "Would you join Miss Joan on the veranda, Miss Ella?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir." O'Leary held up his hand peremptorily. "I
don't believe I can allow that."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say! Then send your man with her. Perfectly safe,
Lieutenant."</p>

<p>O'Leary scowled, but complied. The girl walked slowly from the
room, followed by the husky Winewood constable.</p>

<p>"Thanks no end." Vance tossed his cigarette into the grate.
"Lieutenant, I promised you additional information. Here it is." He
brought forth the folded paper from his pocket, and passed it to
O'Leary.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant unfolded it, glanced at it with quickly moving
eyes, then read it aloud: "Whisky glass submitted shows clear
prints of Jasper Biset. Description also corresponds. Biset reputed
head of international organization of high-pressure jewel thieves.
Generally keeps in background. No cause for criminal action against
him available. Better known abroad, but would be recognized here.
Last tabbed in Saint Moritz, Switzerland."</p>

<p>O'Leary looked up blankly.</p>

<p>"Let me explain further." Vance spoke. "On my first evening here
I saw a face. Strangely familiar. Vague association. With
Amsterdam. There were eyebrows meeting above the nose. Like a black
shaft. But the face wasn't right. No. Something missin'. Should
have been a mustache. Bristly. However...Mustaches come and go. On
impulse, I took the glass from which the gentleman had been
imbibing too much Bourbon. Sent it, with note and general
description, to New York police. Hopin'...That's the verbatim
report. Just received."</p>

<p>"Who is Jasper Biset?" O'Leary's voice was tinged with
exasperation.</p>

<p>"Gent known to police as Jasper Biset is here under preferable
name of Jacques Bassett. Guest of the Manor. More specifically of
Mr. Richard Rexon."</p>

<p>Carrington Rexon gave a start but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Then you think he's the one&mdash;" began O'Leary.</p>

<p>"Don't know, Lieutenant. Those are all the facts I have. Bein'
honest. Keepin' an open mind. Like yourself. But a chat with
Biset&mdash;Bassett is clearly indicated&mdash;eh, what? Shall we
do it here?"</p>

<p>O'Leary, somewhat dazed and uncertain, nodded.</p>

<p>Vance turned to Rexon. "Will you have the gentleman summoned,
sir?"</p>

<p>Rexon, frowning deeply, rang. Higgins appeared and was given
instructions. Vance paced up and down the room. He lighted a fresh
<i>R&eacute;gie</i>. The Lieutenant stood stoically at the window.
He fumbled with his pipe.</p>

<p>Higgins returned. "Sorry, sir. Mr. Bassett is not in his
room."</p>

<p>"Well, can't you find him, man?" Rexon showed impatience.</p>

<p>"It would seem, sir, the gentleman hasn't been in his room all
night."</p>

<p>"Oh, my word!" Vance stood perfectly still, his cigarette
halfway to his lips. "Are you sure, Higgins?"</p>

<p>"I knocked on the door, sir. No one answered. The door was
unlocked, and I looked in, sir. The bed hasn't been slept in all
night. I checked with the chambermaid, sir."</p>

<p>A groan escaped from Rexon.</p>

<p>O'Leary stood up, aggressively indignant. "I felt we should have
acted sooner, Mr. Vance."</p>

<p>Vance ignored the implied reprimand. "Higgins, call the
garage."</p>

<p>The butler dialed three numbers, handed the instrument to
Vance.</p>

<p>"Any car been taken out this morning?" Vance waited a moment.
"And last night?"...He put the telephone down. "Every car cozily in
its place. Curious. Suppose we toddle up to the gentleman's
boudoir."</p>

<p>The room showed no sign of disorder. One closet held a number of
suits neatly arranged on their hangers. The other disclosed a grey
topcoat, a tan one, two or three robes, and several pairs of shoes.
Three hats rested on an upper shelf. From the closets Vance went to
the bureau, inspected the drawers. These were neatly filled with
the customary accessories of a man of taste. A trunk stood in one
corner of the room with a matching bag beside it. Vance opened
these, found them empty.</p>

<p>"Can't see that we'll learn anything here." He took in every
detail of the room. "Suggest we go down to Winewood. Confab with
the station master might prove illuminatin'."</p>

<p>The Lieutenant's small car was parked outside the veranda.
O'Leary turned toward it as we came down the steps.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say!" Vance checked him. "Please! Mind functions more
efficiently at lesser speed. Let's go on foot. If you don't
mind."</p>

<p>O'Leary shrugged. We continued to the end of the pathway, swung
into the vehicle road leading through the estate to the county
highway. The fresh layer of snow was unmarred but for a single set
of tire tracks marking the Lieutenant's arrival an hour or two
earlier.</p>

<p>Vance lighted a cigarette. We trudged along.</p>

<p>"Not every day one has the opportunity to lay his hands on a
murderer." O'Leary spoke glumly. "Too bad if he's got away."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Quite. Very sad. But I'm not convinced the man is a
murderer. My own observations contraindicative. No. Not the type
that deals in murder. Too suave. Wouldn't bloody his hands."</p>

<p>"Then you don't think he killed Wallen in an earlier attempt to
get at the emeralds?" O'Leary seemed surprised.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;oh, no. As I said. Not the type. However..."</p>

<p>"But you admit he's gone off now with the gems?"</p>

<p>"My dear Lieutenant! I admit nothing. Just lookin' round at
present. Strivin' to learn."</p>

<p>"That throws us back on Eric Gunthar. Has he been asked to
account for himself during yesterday's incident?"</p>

<p>"No. Not yet. Good thought, however. I'll speak with him later.
'Where were you on the night?' And all that sort of thing. Might
help. Might not..." Vance flung the end of his cigarette aside.</p>

<p>We had just passed through the large gates and taken perhaps a
hundred paces on the highway toward Winewood.</p>

<p>O'Leary brought out his pipe. "The car would have been
quicker&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quicker. Yes." Vance stopped abruptly. "But not as productive
of results...Look yonder, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>He directed our gaze into a clump of trees at one side of the
roadway, just beneath the towering wall of the Rexon estate. An
irregular mound of snow, with patches of black here and there,
ended in a pair of patent leather shoes.</p>

<p>"Might have driven right past that, don't y' know." Vance
stepped through the undergrowth. O'Leary followed in abashed
silence.</p>

<p>As we came nearer, the mass resolved itself into the outlines of
a hunched human form, one arm twisted crazily under the torso; the
other extended straight from the shoulder.</p>

<p>"That, I opine, is our missing jewel expert." Vance spoke
solemnly. He approached the figure, turned the face upward.</p>

<p>It was Jacques Bassett, in the evening attire in which I had
last seen him the previous night. Now he wore a black Chesterfield
as well. Vance bent down, examined the body more closely. A streak
of sticky, darkened snow above the right ear caught his
attention.</p>

<p>"Same like Wallen, Lieutenant. Not a nice business. Not at all a
nice business. No."</p>

<p>"You're right, sir. Too much like Wallen. Same kind of wound. I
don't like it either, sir...Been dead long, would you say?" O'Leary
asked as Vance rose.</p>

<p>"Eight or ten hours. But, my word, Lieutenant! I'm not the
Medical Examiner. Should have Quayne here. Shall I stagger back to
the Manor and phone your Aesculapius, or would you prefer to do the
chore while I wait here?"</p>

<p>"No need for you to stay here, sir." O'Leary was respectful.
"I'll remain. If you'll be good enough to phone Doctor Quayne."</p>

<p>"Gladly, Lieutenant...By the by,..." Vance hesitated. "Could you
tell me if the emeralds are in the gentleman's attire?"</p>

<p>"Really shouldn't do it, sir. Against regulations." O'Leary
knelt down as he spoke and made a swift examination of Bassett's
pockets. He rose. "No emeralds, sir. Just the usual." Then he added
quickly, "You see what this means, sir?"</p>

<p>Vance looked at the other from the corner of his eye. "You're
far too clever for this bailiwick, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>"I like it here...It does throw the case back on Eric Gunthar
harder than ever&mdash;doesn't it, sir?"</p>

<p>Vance nodded. "I'm afraid it does&mdash;theoretically. But
surely, Lieutenant, you don't believe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not paid to believe things, sir. I'm paid to follow facts."
O'Leary drew on his pipe. "And I'm afraid I'll have to go through
with the arrest of Gunthar and his daughter. I'm telling you now,
sir. I want to be fair."</p>

<p>"I understand, Lieutenant." Turning away, Vance retraced his
steps to the Manor.</p>

<p>On the veranda a few of the guests were talking animatedly. Joan
Rexon had gone indoors. Ella Gunthar sat apart from the others,
looking listlessly toward the rink. She was still guarded rather
ludicrously by the Winewood constable. Vance approached her.</p>

<p>"Listen carefully, my dear. There's real danger for you and your
father. I need your help. You and I must work together. We'll get
rid of the nightmare: Here's what I want you to do. Get your skates
and skating costume. Tell your father Mr. Rexon would like to see
him in his den. And Old Jed too, if you can find him. This
gentleman will accompany you."&mdash;Vance indicated the
constable.&mdash;"Then you are to come back here to the rink and
skate as if everything you ever wanted depended on it. Keep all the
guests interested. Keep them away from the house at any cost. Skate
until I give you the signal to stop. In the meantime, I'll be
working hard for you and your father. Understand?"</p>

<p>The girl's lips quivered. Then she raised her chin and looked
Vance straight in the eye. "I'll do everything you ask." There was
determination, submission, heroism, in her voice. She turned toward
the pavilion, the burly officer close behind her.</p>

<p>Vance started for the den. Carlotta Naesmith ran up
inquisitively, as if to ask a question.</p>

<p>Vance held up his hand. "Not now, please. I have an urgent favor
to ask of you. All the guests must be kept out here. Away from the
house. Ella Gunthar is going to skate for them. You've hurt her
much. She's suffering now. Be kind."</p>

<p>Before Miss Naesmith could answer, Vance continued to the
den.</p>

<p>He found Carrington Rexon still alone there and briefly told him
of the new developments.</p>

<p>The man sank dejectedly into a chair. "Another death!" he
groaned miserably. "And the emeralds?"</p>

<p>"Not on him. May still be recovered."</p>

<p>Vance reached for the telephone. He called Quayne, apprised him
of the situation, and informed him just where he would find
Lieutenant O'Leary waiting by Bassett's body.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it all, Vance?" asked Rexon as the other
sat down opposite.</p>

<p>"Nothing yet, old friend. Tryin' to add things up. Must make a
simple sum eventually...Would you ask your housekeeper to come
here, please? A few queries I'd like to put to her."</p>

<p>Rexon telephoned the request.</p>

<p>Vance rose with suppressed nervousness and went to the window.
He lighted a cigarette. At length he turned and faced his host.</p>

<p>"I've a feeling that somewhere this morning I've missed
something. Of no importance. Bothers me no end, though. Something
unconsciously waited for. Hasn't happened..."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br>
SKATING FOR TIME</h2>

<p><b>(<i>Sunday, January 19; 1:15 p.m.</i>)</b>
</p>

<p>Marcia Bruce came in, dignified and composed. Vance drew up a
chair for her.</p>

<p>"We have a few questions to put to you, Miss Bruce," he began
tentatively.</p>

<p>"Nothing here surprises me any more," the housekeeper returned
philosophically. "I'll do my best to answer."</p>

<p>"You know, of course, that several of the emeralds have been
stolen from the Gem Room?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Rexon has informed me of it. That surprises me less than
anything else. I'll be glad to be free of the atmosphere
surrounding those stones."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Bruce?" interposed Rexon.</p>

<p>"I might as well tell you, sir. You'll have to know sooner or
later. I'm resigning immediately, sir. And leaving here for good in
about a week&mdash;maybe sooner."</p>

<p>"Resigning! Leaving! But why, Bruce?"</p>

<p>The woman blushed. "Doctor Quayne has done me the honor of
asking me to marry him."</p>

<p>Vance smiled pleasantly. "Well, well! That would have been last
evening&mdash;eh, what, Miss Bruce? Just before you came for Miss
Joan."</p>

<p>The woman seemed startled. "How could you know that?"</p>

<p>"Lovelight in a woman's eyes. I saw the signs. May I be the
first to congratulate you."</p>

<p>"And I too, am delighted to hear it, Bruce..." Rexon's voice
trailed off. Then, "But couldn't you stay on? Joan would miss
you..."</p>

<p>"And I'll be sorry to leave Miss Joan, sir. But
Loomis&mdash;that is, the doctor&mdash;wants to leave Winewood. He
finds it increasingly difficult to manage here&mdash;what with two
younger men making such inroads on his practice."</p>

<p>"Where does he plan to go?"</p>

<p>"I'm not quite sure yet, sir. He mentioned the possibility of
going abroad."</p>

<p>Rexon nodded resignedly. "I understand. I understand. I imagine
it <i>is</i> getting a hard row for Quayne to hoe. But, Gad! I'll
miss him. And you too, Bruce."</p>

<p>"To get back to less pleasant matters, Miss Bruce." Vance seated
himself on the arm of a chair. "You must have been down on the
lower floor here yesterday about noon."</p>

<p>"I was. I was down most of the morning, seeing about meals,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you see Eric Gunthar here?"</p>

<p>"I noticed him hovering outside the rear entrance. But I don't
know whether he came into the house."</p>

<p>"Did you see Old Jed?"</p>

<p>"That hermit! He never comes near the house, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, can you remember any one you did specifically see? Out in
the hall there, or near the Gem Room?"</p>

<p>"So many of the guests were up and down." She hesitated a
moment, as if to collect her thoughts. "Mr. Richard dashed through
the hall once or twice. I think I saw his foreign-looking friend,
too. And that treasure-hunting gentleman was hovering around. I
don't know whether he was waiting for Miss Naesmith, or what. And I
saw Doctor Quayne, though I didn't have a chance to speak to him."
She seemed avid for any excuse to mention the man's name.</p>

<p>"Was that when he arrived in the morning?" Vance asked.</p>

<p>"No. It was when he was leaving. He had stayed longer than usual
and he was late. I remember the noon siren had blown a few minutes
earlier&mdash;"</p>

<p>Vance sprang to his feet and held up his hand for silence. A
far-away look came into his eyes. He paced back and forth nervously
several times. Then he came to a sudden stop before Rexon's
desk.</p>

<p>"That insignificant something," he remarked slowly, as he sank
into a chair. "I think I have it. The siren. Haven't heard it
today."</p>

<p>"It's not sounded on Sundays," Rexon told him.</p>

<p>"No. Of course not. But yesterday."</p>

<p>"What can the siren have to do with it all, Vance?"</p>

<p>"Everything. Needs a little thought." He brought out his case
and selected a cigarette with marked deliberation. He walked to the
window, stood gazing out for a moment. As he turned back, a soft
knock on the door was followed by the timid entry of Eric Gunthar,
twisting his hat nervously in his hands.</p>

<p>"You wanted to see me, Squire?" he asked, looking down at the
floor.</p>

<p>It was Vance who answered his query. "You might as well know the
worst, Gunthar. Lieutenant O'Leary is determined to arrest you and
Miss Ella on what he calls suspicion. You must have noted he has a
constable watching Miss Ella now...She came back with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. She did. She's down at the pavilion, changing her
clothes. She said she was going to skate on the rink."</p>

<p>"Good," said Vance. "We must all go out and watch her anon."</p>

<p>"She asked me to tell you, sir, that she couldn't find Old Jed
anywhere."</p>

<p>"Thank you. It doesn't matter...But to get back to what I was
saying. I see no reason why you shouldn't be here too. No use
trying to run away. The Lieutenant will arrive any minute. You're
to sit there. Trust to me. Just as Ella is doing. I'll do my best.
May fail. But can't be helped. Sit tight and wait. Understand?"</p>

<p>Nodding dejectedly, the man moved with awkward steps to the
chair Vance had indicated. He continued the twirling motion of the
hat in his hands for a moment. Then he placed the hat behind him
and rested his head docilely on the palms of his hands. He was
abashed, frightened.</p>

<p>Vance had scarcely resumed his own seat before Rexon's desk when
another tap on the door announced the arrival of the Lieutenant and
Doctor Quayne. A faint odor of gasoline accompanied them.</p>

<p>"I see your chariot has had another intramuscular injection,
doctor," Vance said pleasantly. Quayne merely nodded.</p>

<p>"Greetings and congratulations, doctor," said Rexon. "Bruce has
just told us of the betrothal..."</p>

<p>Quayne smiled and looked admiringly at Marcia Bruce. He seated
himself on the long leather divan, and Miss Bruce rose from her
chair and joined him.</p>

<p>"I felt somehow you'd be pleased, Rexon," Quayne said with some
show of pride.</p>

<p>"Naturally. But I'll miss you both. So will Joan."</p>

<p>O'Leary mumbled felicitations, his gaze on the downcast figure
of Gunthar perched uneasily on the edge of his chair. Then he
furrowed his brow in a puzzled frown and sought Vance's eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes. Quite, Lieutenant. Doing the bighearted. Knew you'd be
poppin' in anon. Thought I'd have Gunthar handy for you. Trying to
do my share. Always appreciative of favors."</p>

<p>"And the girl?"</p>

<p>"Waiting for you, too. After a manner of speaking. If she isn't
already out on the rink she'll be there in a minute or two. Skating
for the guests. Under the eagle eye of your doughty constable, of
course."</p>

<p>O'Leary suddenly stepped back, narrowed his eyes and looked at
Vance shrewdly. "What's the meaning of all this, sir? There's
something underneath."</p>

<p>Vance smiled wearily and nodded. "Right you are, Lieutenant!
Something underneath. But what? I think it's the siren&mdash;the
Rexon noonday siren, Lieutenant, which echoes through the hills
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>O'Leary broke in impatiently. "Just where is this leading,
sir?"</p>

<p>"To a mere bit of chatting. Puttin' things together. Askin' a
few questions. Searchin' our souls. Good for the soul now and then.
When all that's done, you may lead Gunthar and his daughter forth.
If that should still be your desire, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>"Sounds like hocus-pocus to me, sir."</p>

<p>"More or less true of all life&mdash;eh, what?"</p>

<p>"How long is this to take, sir?" O'Leary's restlessness was
apparent. "I've gone pretty far with you already. For my part, I'm
ready to take them now..."</p>

<p>"You shall call the time yourself, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>O'Leary packed his pipe. "That's fair."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;oh, yes. Always fair. May be futile at times. But
fair."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br>
QUERIES AND ANSWERS</h2>

<p><b>(<i>Sunday, January 19; 1:45 p.m.</i>)</b>
</p>

<p>Doctor Quayne moved uneasily in his place on the divan. "It's a
bad business," he remarked. "A bad business. Bassett's been dead at
least ten hours. We had the body removed to the morgue. Another
autopsy to do. From what I've seen offhand, I can only say that he
met his death very much as Wallen did. But this time there is no
cliff from which he might have fallen."</p>

<p>"You, too, noticed the similarity of the wounds, did you,
doctor?" O'Leary put in.</p>

<p>"It could hardly be overlooked," returned Quayne. "I've never
seen such a strange coincidence. If I weren't so confused by other
factors I'd be willing to state under oath that both deaths were
caused in the same manner."</p>

<p>O'Leary compressed his lips with great satisfaction and nodded
energetically. "The same thought occurred to me," he said.</p>

<p>"I understand, Mr. Vance," the doctor went on, "that you had an
official report on the man this morning that throws a rather
sinister light on the matter. From what Lieutenant O'Leary has told
me, I've formed a theory that I'd like to put before you."</p>

<p>"Pray do," said Vance eagerly.</p>

<p>"It is this: Obviously Bassett came here with the sole purpose
of getting his hands on at least some of Mr. Rexon's emeralds. If
we assume that his first attempt was made from outside and that he
was surprised in his effort by the guard, Wallen, we can conclude
that he had then but one course left to him. Namely, to do away
with Wallen. Let us further assume that he took this course; that
he was <i>seen</i> taking it, by a friend of Wallen who was, in the
circumstances, helpless to prevent the murder. This second man, you
may be sure, would carry the grudge, and take his revenge at the
very first opportunity. These men are a very simple folk, Mr.
Vance. They believe whole-heartedly in the Mosaic law 'An eye for
an eye'. They wouldn't hesitate to take matters into their own
hands and mete out what they consider retributive justice."</p>

<p>"Very plausible theory, doctor," said Vance. "Worthy of
consideration." Quayne nodded in acknowledgment of the compliment.
Then Vance looked abruptly at Miss Bruce, sitting beside her
fianc&eacute;. "You say you saw Mr. Sydes flittin' round down here
about noontime?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>Vance now spoke to Rexon. "Will you send for the gentleman? And
your son as well. Immediately, please. Speed, old friend. The
leaves are turning. The bird is on the wing. Time is running
out."</p>

<p>Rexon rang for the butler, relayed the request to him.</p>

<p>In a very few minutes a knock on the door was followed by the
swaggering entrance of Stanley Sydes, with Richard Rexon close
behind him. The younger man walked to the window behind his
father's desk and sat down on the broad sill. Sydes remained
standing, resting his arms on the back of an empty chair.</p>

<p>"Quite a conclave here," he commented casually. "I do hope we're
not all going to pass up Miss Gunthar's performance. I've never
seen anyone who can claim to be her equal on ice."</p>

<p>"You're not alone in that opinion, Mr. Sydes," Vance remarked.
"We'll try not to detain you too long...Could you possibly recall
just where you were yesterday when the noonday whistle sounded?
Miss Bruce here thinks she saw you about that time, wanderin' in
the lower hall."</p>

<p>Sides laughed boisterously. "I can't say the lady is wrong.
Probably was heading for the bar to soothe my jangled nerves."</p>

<p>"Hope the antidote was effective." Vance smiled. "Looking
tip-top today...Irrelevantly speakin', Mr. Sydes, does your
interest run only to <i>buried</i> treasure?" Vance looked at the
man keenly.</p>

<p>"I don't think I understand you, sir. As I said once before,
it's the thrill of the search that lures me on. But I don't suppose
any man would turn up his nose at a treasure right under his
nose&mdash;if I may make a quip."</p>

<p>"Did you know of Mr. Rexon's collection of emeralds?"</p>

<p>"Strangely enough, not until I'd been here a day or two. It was
other game that brought me here. However, I might add that I was
genuinely disappointed when I learned we were not to see the
stones, after all."</p>

<p>"Do you happen to know why Mr. Rexon hasn't opened the Gem Room
to his guests?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I haven't the faintest idea. And I haven't been
presumptuous enough to inquire."</p>

<p>"Admirable restraint," murmured Vance. "Deservin' of
appeasement. I'll answer the unasked question for you. The fact is,
a number of the Rexon emeralds have disappeared from the Gem
Room&mdash;undoubtedly stolen. And one of the guests&mdash;Mr.
Bassett&mdash;has been murdered."</p>

<p>Richard Rexon rose with a bound from his place at the
window.</p>

<p>Sydes straightened up and drew in his breath. "Incredible!" he
mumbled. "Why, I saw the man only&mdash;" He broke off.</p>

<p>"Yes?" prompted Vance. "When <i>did</i> you see Bassett
last?"</p>

<p>"Now that I think of it," Sydes returned lamely, "I haven't seen
him today at all...Is there anything I can do?"</p>

<p>"Thank you. Only to rejoin the others and help Miss Gunthar keep
them entertained and out of our way."</p>

<p>Sydes bowed himself out with a look of concern mingled with
relief.</p>

<p>Young Rexon was conversing in an undertone with his father. He
looked bewildered as he stepped back to the window. Vance turned to
him.</p>

<p>"How much did you know about your friend Bassett, Mr.
Richard?"</p>

<p>The young man did not answer immediately. Vance lighted a
cigarette while he waited. Finally young Rexon spoke.</p>

<p>"Not too much, I'm afraid. Only that he seemed a likable enough
chap. And he was a pleasant traveling companion."</p>

<p>"Hardly sufficient recommendation," grumbled the elder Rexon
bitterly. "The man was a scoundrel!"</p>

<p>"Did you know," Vance asked carelessly, "that during his brief
stay here he was annoying Miss Ella?" Richard Rexon only shook his
head. Vance continued. "Old Jed found it necess'ry to reprimand him
severely. Perhaps Jed did more than that."</p>

<p>Eric Gunthar jumped from his chair. "You can't say that, sir!
The hermit may be a queer one, but he didn't murder nobody!" The
man seemed surprised at his own outburst. He sank back to his
chair.</p>

<p>Quayne looked across at Vance with significance. "Bearing out my
earlier contention, Mr. Vance."</p>

<p>Vance nodded abstractedly. He found an ash tray and broke the
ashes from his cigarette. "Tell me, Gunthar: was this hermit of
yours friendly with Lief Wallen?"</p>

<p>"The hermit ain't friendly with nobody. Except, maybe, my
Ella."</p>

<p>"Had Wallen <i>any</i> friend on the estate who would want to
avenge him if he thought there had been foul play ?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about friends. But any man of us would do that if
we had cause."</p>

<p>"Very interestin'. And most commendable...But I think Lieutenant
O'Leary has a query or two to put to you." Vance made a broad
gesture with his hand, as if turning over a witness to the
opposition.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gunthar," the Lieutenant began, "you were at Murphy's
tavern the night Wallen died?"</p>

<p>Gunthar thought back. "Yes, I was."</p>

<p>"And did you go directly to your cottage from there?"</p>

<p>"You might say I did, sir. I only stopped outside the house
here, just to see what was doin'."</p>

<p>"Did you see Wallen?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I don't think so," said Gunthar hesitantly. Then he
amended his statement. "Or if I did, I wouldn't have noticed
specially."</p>

<p>"Did you come up to the Manor yesterday, Gunthar?" The
Lieutenant was becoming more belligerent.</p>

<p>"Well, I did&mdash;and I didn't. I mean, I didn't come into the
house exactly."</p>

<p>"What did you come for?"</p>

<p>"To talk with the Squire." He looked uneasily at Rexon. "You
see, Mr. Richard wanted I should come up here and promise the
Squire I wouldn't drink no more if he'd let me keep my job. So I
come up here first thing in the morning. But the Squire wasn't down
yet. Later Mr. Richard come down to me where I was busy at the
pavilion an' told me to go up again. I didn't want to, but Mr.
Richard he wouldn't let me off. So I come up. I had a bottle with
me, an' I took another drink on my way. Just to buck me up, you
know. An' when I come up to the house I stopped to make up what I
would say. Then I thought the Squire wouldn't like it if he could
smell the liquor on me. I was outside for a bit, changing my mind
this way an' that. But I didn't come in. I went back to the
pavilion. After lunch Mr. Richard come down again to ask
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's enough." O'Leary interrupted the recital
impatiently.</p>

<p>"I think, Lieutenant," Vance interposed mildly, "the doctor's
theory is more plausible. However, I have known medical men who,
when they did not like a diagnosis which could not be proven all
the way, would substitute a more acceptable alternative based on
the same principal factors."</p>

<p>"A discerning observation," commented Quayne dryly.</p>

<p>"We start then, with the admissible assumption that the guard,
having frustrated an attempt to enter the Gem Room from outside, is
deliberately murdered. That there is an eye witness to this murder
seems not too preposterous. We know definitely that access to the
room is later effected by means of Mr. Rexon's key. We likewise
know, beyond a doubt, that one Bassett, with sufficient and
understandable reason to be interested in the emeralds, falls
victim to a second murder."</p>

<p>Vance paused to light a fresh <i>R&eacute;gie</i>.</p>

<p>"We find, ourselves confronted," he resumed, "with more unknown
quantities than I care to cope with in a single problem: Who
witnessed that first hypothetical murder? Who managed to procure
the key to the Gem Room and appropriate the emeralds? Finally, who
finished Bassett, and why?"</p>

<p>He puffed thoughtfully on his cigarette and looked about.</p>

<p>"Offhand," he continued, "Bassett seems the logical choice for
the second factor of the puzzle." The others nodded in agreement.
"If only we had found the emeralds on him&mdash;or in his
room..."</p>

<p>"Has a thorough search been made?" asked Carrington Rexon
hopefully.</p>

<p>Before Vance could answer, the doctor spoke again. "My dear
Rexon," he said, almost as if to a child. "The man was not so
simple as to have left them carelessly about. He might have wrapped
them securely in a packet and mailed them off somewhere."</p>

<p>"A reasonable suggestion," agreed Vance. "On the other hand, I
am compellingly driven to the conclusion that Bassett could not
have taken the emeralds at all."</p>

<p>There was a murmur of surprised dissent.</p>

<p>"Why not, Mr. Vance?" It was O'Leary who asked the question.</p>

<p>"For the simple reason, Lieutenant, that he wouldn't have had
the time. Mr. Rexon has told us that he heard the beginning of the
noon siren just as he was struck and lost consciousness. Is that
correct, old friend?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely, Vance. I am positive of it."</p>

<p>"But," interposed the doctor, "I wasn't called till after
half-past twelve. I presume that no one knew of Mr. Rexon's
predicament until then."</p>

<p>"Quite right, doctor," Vance told him. "And yet, I persist in
the opinion that Bassett could not have managed it...Habit dulls
our awareness of the repetitious act or sound. How many of us are
conscious of the striking of a clock unless we are waiting for it?
We let time glide past us unnoticed. But let a man have a train to
catch or a timed appointment to keep, and the tick of his watch
acquires significance for him...Is that psychologically correct,
Doctor Quayne?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," agreed Quayne. He placed a hand on the shoulder
of the woman beside him; but she seemed lost in her own
thoughts.</p>

<p>"Very well, then...Bassett joined us on the veranda almost
before the echo of the siren died away. You may have noticed
him."</p>

<p>"Can't say that I did." The doctor coughed negligently.</p>

<p>"Possibly not. Aloof sort of johnnie. Remained at one end of the
veranda&mdash;alone. Queer thing is that I wouldn't have noticed
the siren. Hadn't noticed it on other days. Habit, as I say, dulls
our senses, don't y' know. But though I was unconscious of the fact
at the moment, the sound was forcibly called to my attention. By
yourself, doctor. Do you recall?"</p>

<p>"It's quite possible. I remember I was in a hurry. I'd stayed
longer than I intended."</p>

<p>"Exactly. But the important thing is&mdash;you couldn't know,
doctor, because you left us immediately&mdash;that <i>Bassett
remained on the veranda for the next half hour at least.</i>...Does
that establish my contention?"</p>

<p>Again there was a subdued murmuring among the others.</p>

<p>"Of necessity eliminating Bassett from that phase of our little
problem play, whom can we enter in his stead?...Sydes was
undoubtedly speaking the truth here."</p>

<p>"That may be, Mr. Vance," O'Leary conceded. "But what of Eric
Gunthar? I'm about ready to call time, sir."</p>

<p>Gunthar squirmed in his chair. Young Rexon came forward.</p>

<p>"If you will permit me, sir, I think I can bear out Gunthar's
statements. You can depend on it, he's told you the truth."</p>

<p>"Yes, Lieutenant," supplemented Vance. "Let me say this for
Gunthar: He's been weak. He's been foolish. He's let his normal ego
and competency run to aggressiveness. Hence his enemies. Then he
began drinking too much. To bolster his confidence. Not wise. No.
Result: both he and his daughter are in devilish hot water.
However, I'm not believin' he's guilty. And I think you will agree
with me shortly, Lieutenant. A few more short minutes,
please..."</p>

<p>He looked at O'Leary, got a grudging nod from him. Then he faced
young Rexon.</p>

<p>"What about yourself, Mr. Richard? Could you have taken your
father's emeralds and wrapped them securely in a
packet&mdash;?"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a half-smothered shriek from Marcia Bruce.
She suddenly rose from her place on the sofa.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" she moaned as she ran from the room.</p>

<p>Quayne looked after her in astonishment.</p>

<p>Vance's question had left us all equally stunned. Young Rexon
stood white and speechless facing his accuser.</p>

<p>"From what I've observed and heard," Vance went on relentlessly,
"and leaving the question of motive aside for the moment, you seem
to have had every opportunity&mdash;"</p>

<p>Carrington Rexon leaped from his chair and pounded the desk with
his fist.</p>

<p>"See here, Vance!" he thundered. "This has gone far enough! If
you're going to make a farce of it, I prefer to say be damned to
the emeralds, and drop the matter right now."</p>

<p>"Rexon's quite right," put in Quayne impressively. "Think of the
scandal..."</p>

<p>"I am thinking of it." Vance's manner remained cool. "But it is
no longer a question of just the emeralds. We have certainly one
murder on our hands. Possibly two. Surely, you wouldn't say 'be
damned' to that."</p>

<p>The elder Rexon shook his head despondently. He sank back into
his chair. The son, at a gesture of dismissal from Vance, resumed
his former place on the window sill.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br>
FINAL CURTAIN</h2>

<p><b>(<i>Sunday, January 19; 2:45 p.m.</i>)</b>
</p>

<p>Vance took a few paces across the room. His attention was caught
by a pair of eyes peering in at the window behind Richard Rexon. It
was the Green Hermit. He made no move as Vance approached the
window and raised it.</p>

<p>"Might as well join us in here, Jed," Vance suggested casually.
"You'll see much better, don't y' know. And hear. More
satisfact'ry, what?" He closed the window as the old man moved
away.</p>

<p>Vance came back to a chair, crossed his knees as he sat
down.</p>

<p>Higgins opened the door with a surprised look on his face. "It's
Old Jed, sir," he mumbled awkwardly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;oh, yes. Let him come in." It was Vance who
spoke.</p>

<p>The white-haired old man came shuffling into the room, looking
from side to side as if to find a place where he might hide. He
finally chose a chair in the corner nearest Vance and sat down
without a word.</p>

<p>"Where do we stand now?" Vance began anew. "Ah, yes. We still
have to determine the identity of the persons involved in a
dramatic piece of mayhem and thievery."</p>

<p>He rose from the chair and stood leaning against it.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rexon tells me, Doctor Quayne, that you are planning to
leave Winewood." Vance looked at the man lazily.</p>

<p>The doctor seemed taken aback. "Frankly, yes," he returned.
"Though I don't recall having mentioned it. At any rate, I don't
see what my future plans can have to do with this matter."</p>

<p>"You will in a moment, doctor." Vance brought out a visiting
card and a pencil. He wrote a few words hastily, toyed with the
card for a moment. "Our problem is falling nicely into line," he
announced, looking up. "I said Bassett could not have obtained the
jewels. But he could&mdash;and probably <i>did</i>&mdash;assault
Mr. Rexon and secure the key to the Gem Room...Yes. He would have
had just enough time for that...This assumption assigns to him half
of the second r&ocirc;le. But our cast is still woefully
incomplete...Permit me one more question, Doctor Quayne. Just why
were you determined to let me know it was after twelve
yesterday?"</p>

<p>"I resent the imputation, sir. I was simply in a hurry."</p>

<p>"As you said. In a hurry to get to the Gem Room and out again,
doctor?"</p>

<p>Quayne made no reply. Merely smiled, as at a precocious
child.</p>

<p>The door opened suddenly. Marcia Bruce came rushing back into
the room. Her face was flushed. Her hands were tearing frenziedly
at the paper wrappings of a small parcel. She shot a look of
disgust at the man on the divan.</p>

<p>In the momentary confusion Vance passed the card in his hand to
Lieutenant O'Leary. The latter stepped from the room, returning
almost immediately. He moved leisurely to the divan, sat down
beside Quayne.</p>

<p>Marcia Bruce had removed the last bit of paper and now held in
her trembling hands a small, crudely sewn chamois bag, tied with a
bit of dental floss. She turned fiery green eyes on Quayne.</p>

<p>"You charlatan! You thief!" she flung at him. "Did you think I
could be so easily deceived? Did you think that because of your
honeyed words you could count on me to aid you and shield you in
your hour of need?...Your hour of need!" she repeated disdainfully.
"Hour of shame! Hour of perfidy!"</p>

<p>She turned from him and held the bag out to Vance. He took it
from her, tossed it lightly to the desk.</p>

<p>Carrington Rexon, with shaking fingers, managed to get the bag
opened. He emptied its contents. The brilliant gems formed a
shimmering green pattern on the blotter before him. His son was
again at his side. Together they examined the stones.</p>

<p>"I think they are all here, Vance." The elder Rexon brought out
a pocket handkerchief and placed the stones, one by one, in its
folds.</p>

<p>On the divan Quayne sat deathly pale. He seemed to have aged
years in a few minutes. O'Leary moved a little closer to him.</p>

<p>Vance turned to the housekeeper. "May I ask how that little
pouch came into your possession, madam?"</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> brought it to me." She pointed scornfully. "Last
night. For safekeeping. It was all wrapped up. It was to be a
surprise. A surprise I was to share with him when we were married
and&mdash;" She broke off abruptly.</p>

<p>Vance bowed to the woman. "Thank you, madam. It was the tangible
proof I needed...Fortunate for Mr. Rexon the banks were already
closed yesterday&mdash;eh, what, doctor?"</p>

<p>Quayne shrugged helplessly.</p>

<p>"Your theory wasn't far wrong, doctor...Now, if we assign to
Doctor Quayne the role of obtaining the gems, as circumst'nces so
irresistibly suggest, the problem is no longer a problem."</p>

<p>"But how in the world, Vance&mdash;" Carrington Rexon was at a
loss for words.</p>

<p>"If the good doctor will help me elucidate further...Bassett's
appearance on the veranda yesterday was your cue that he had
carried out his half of the plan.&mdash;Am I right, doctor?"</p>

<p>Quayne gave no sign that he had heard.</p>

<p>"And, having established for yourself an iron-clad alibi through
that perilous hour of noon, you had only to enter the house, take
the key from where you knew he had left it for you, and the rest
was simplicity itself. Your presence anywhere on the lower floor
here would excite no suspicion...But won't you tell us, doctor,
what form of blackmail Bassett employed to induce you to enter this
scheme with him?"</p>

<p>Still Quayne sat in stony silence.</p>

<p>"Then I must resort again to our limited cast," continued Vance.
"You were most helpful a little earlier, doctor. No doubt thought
you were helping yourself. You suggested an eye witness to the
murder of Wallen. Now, whom could we place in that r&ocirc;le more
appropriately than Mr. Bassett?...Of course, it would be only
guess-work. But he would seem to meet every requirement..."</p>

<p>There was an unexpected interruption from the Green Hermit.
"You're not guessing, Mister; if you mean the night Lief Wallen
died I was there. I was there because I came to look for Miss Ella.
Miss Ella oughtn't to come by herself...I saw the doctor walk a
ways with Lief. And I saw your Mr. Bassett walk after them. All
very quiet and peaceful. I didn't know they meant harm..."</p>

<p>Vance suddenly turned to O'Leary with a questioning look. The
Lieutenant arose, making a jerky motion of his arm, much as a
magician does when he is about to produce a surprise. Gradually
dropping from his sleeve, came a heavy straight wrench, about
twelve inches in length, with varied square openings at each end.
He passed it to Vance.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said Vance evenly. "A spanner! Usually part of the
tool equipment of an automobile&mdash;eh, what, doctor?"</p>

<p>Quayne stiffened; his eyes bulged, fastened on the telltale
wrench in Vance's hand.</p>

<p>"Too bad your first attempt to enter the Gem Room was not more
successful, doctor." Vance looked coolly at the man on the divan.
"So Bassett <i>was</i> the eye witness. He must have driven a hard
bargain."</p>

<p>Quayne now spoke for the first time. His voice was strained and
bitter. "Half of what I might get. And he ran only the minimum of
risk."</p>

<p>"And did you take the additional precaution of leaving the
necklace at the pavilion in the hope of further involving Gunthar
who already seemed to be seriously under suspicion?"</p>

<p>The doctor spread his hands in a gesture of hopelessness.</p>

<p>"But in the end you felt you could not trust your partner? You
deemed it safer&mdash;and more profitable&mdash;to put him out of
your way permanently?"</p>

<p>Quayne leaned forward rigidly.</p>

<p>"I might as well tell you everything," he said wearily. "'When I
was abroad two years ago, Richard introduced me to Jacques Bassett.
It was an unfortunate acquaintance for me. From the first I
disliked the man, though I tried to give no indication of it. Brief
as our association was, I felt his evil influence. In a weak moment
I was persuaded to undertake smuggling a packet of gems into this
country for him. I was fairly successful. Though I was under
suspicion for some time, the federal investigation was finally
dropped. When I sent the rascal his share of the transaction, I
thought I had put him out of my life forever...Then Richard came
home and brought Bassett with him. I was distressed to see that
their friendship had continued. But I could say nothing...As I have
already suggested, Bassett's trip here was motivated solely by his
desire to acquire the Rexon emeralds. He lost no time in
re-establishing contact with me. He made it plain to me that he was
fortunate to find an unwilling ally who was necessarily under his
thumb. He gave me the choice of doing as he said or being exposed
in the smuggling matter. He painted rosy pictures for me if I would
follow his bidding...For years I've been hoping to marry Marcia
Bruce..."</p>

<p>He sent a look of appeal across the room to the woman. She had
regained her poise and looked back at him coldly.</p>

<p>"But I never had sufficient income to take care of her," Quayne
continued. "My practice had dwindled to a point where the Rexon fee
was all I could count on. In the many years of my association here,
stealing the emeralds never occurred to me. The scheme was
Bassett's. But I was an easy prey to his designing
chicanery...Wallen interrupted our first attempt, and it became
necessary to get rid of him. I had the spanner with me and used it
to fracture Wallen's skull. Then we dragged him to the cliff and
threw him over. It looked as if we were safe; and I wanted to quit
then. But Bassett held this second crime over my head more
ominously than the first. I had no choice but to go on..."</p>

<p>He paused briefly, then resumed.</p>

<p>"You've shrewdly guessed, Mr. Vance, how Bassett obtained the
key for me...Late last night I met him just outside the grounds to
divide the gems. Distrusting him as I did, I took the spanner along
as a precaution. There was a violent dispute. He threatened me, and
I used the spanner again...The rest you know..."</p>

<p>Quayne rose suddenly. O'Leary did likewise, a pair of manacles
in one hand. Vance made a negative gesture. The doctor looked about
him with clouded eyes. One hand moved slowly from his vest pocket
to his mouth...</p>

<p>He was immediately catapulted back to the divan, in horrible
convulsions. In a few seconds he was still.</p>

<p>"Odor of bitter almonds," Vance commented calmly.
"Cyanide...Wiser than I thought. Leaves us without any problem.
Eliminates the second actor in the dual performance."</p>

<p>A hush fell over the room. Two or three minutes passed.</p>

<p>O'Leary broke the silence. "But, Mr. Vance, how did you get a
line on that wrench?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't over difficult," drawled Vance. "There were two
factors missin' in the pattern. The time element, and the lethal
instrument. The first was cleared up when I realized their clever
ruse built round the siren. The second dawned on me when Quayne
returned with you this afternoon from viewing Bassett's body. He
brought a noticeable aroma of gasoline with him. And I was reminded
of an evening earlier in the week when he spoke of priming the
engine of his car instead of using the starter. There are two tools
with which to remove the spark plugs for this process: a socket
wrench, or a spanner...You will recall the nature of the injuries
on Wallen's skull and on Bassett's. A linear depressed fracture
over the thin temporal bone. A crushing blow with a stout steel
wrench would do the trick. I mentioned just such a weapon as a
possibility on the morning Wallen was found."</p>

<p>Vance paused to light a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Ordin'rily, of course, the murderous weapon is disposed of as
quickly as possible. But in this case it must of necessity be kept
on hand to loosen the spark plugs. I was convinced it would be
found within easy reach&mdash;on the floor of his car, perhaps...Is
that correct, Lieutenant?"</p>

<p>O'Leary nodded admiringly. "But, Mr. Vance," he said somewhat
sheepishly, "suppose you hadn't been on the veranda when that siren
sounded? Quayne couldn't count on your presence at the right
moment."</p>

<p>"Obviously not. That wouldn't have mattered. He counted on Miss
Joan and Miss Ella. Served his purpose admirably. Perhaps better,
in fact. And yet...I don't know. He would have insisted on bringing
the point up. He considered it his irrefutable 'out,' don't y'
know..."</p>

<p>"And how," asked, Carrington Rexon, "did Bassett manage to come
in here without my seeing him?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you say you were out of the room, old friend?" Vance
drew deeply on his <i>R&eacute;gie</i>. "The man was patient. He
was playing for big odds..."</p>

<p>Carlotta Naesmith burst into the room. "The poor kid's all tired
out, Sir Galahad. But she says you told her to keep on
skating."</p>

<p>Vance quickly stepped before the limp figure of Quayne on the
divan. "Thank you, Miss Naesmith. I'll tell her in a moment that
it's all right now. We'll all be joining you."</p>

<p>"Please, Sir Galahad, let me tell her." Miss Naesmith whisked
from the room before Vance could reply.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>The guests left Rexon Manor the next morning. Richard Rexon,
too, was to drive to New York with Vance and me later in the day.
Carlotta Naesmith and Stanley Sydes were the last to take their
departure. We formed a somewhat subdued group on the veranda as
Higgins carried their bags out.</p>

<p>Miss Naesmith stopped on the terrace. "You'll mail me your new
address, Dick?" she called back. "I'll be sending you picture
post-cards from Cocos Island. I hope you'll like that, Dick."</p>

<p>A smile of understanding passed between the two as Carrington
Rexon knit his brows.</p>

<p>Sydes, still on the veranda, called out: "You mean that,
Goddess?"</p>

<p>"Nothing else but," she replied as she ran to the car. "When do
we start?"</p>

<p>"As soon as we can get to the yacht, darling." And Sydes went
after her.</p>

<p>A little later Vance was in Carrington Rexon's den bidding him
adieu.</p>

<p>"The ingratitude of our young folks," Rexon complained bitterly.
"I don't know what the world is coming to."</p>

<p>"Really, now, it isn't that bad," Vance said sympathetically.
"And wasn't it you, Squire Rexon, who said something about the
human heart desiring happiness for others?"</p>

<p>Rexon looked up at him, and a new light came slowly into his
eyes.</p>

<p>Richard came in. "You'll see that Higgins gets my trunks off,
Dad?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my boy. Take care of yourself...And&mdash;before you
go, son, will you bring Ella in here to me."</p>

<p>Walking out with a smile on his lips, Vance left the two
together.</p>

<h2>TWENTY RULES FOR WRITING DETECTIVE STORIES<br>
by S. S. Van Dine</h2>

<p>The detective story is a game. It is more&mdash;it is a sporting
event. And the author must play fair with the reader. He can no
more resort to trickeries and deceptions and still retain his
honesty than if he cheated in a bridge game. He must outwit the
reader, and hold the reader's interest, through sheer ingenuity.
For the writing of detective stories there are very definite
laws&mdash;unwritten, perhaps, but none the less binding: and every
respectable and self-respecting concocter of literary mysteries
lives up to them.</p>

<p>Herewith, then, is a sort of Credo, based partly on the practice
of all the great writers of stories, and partly on the promptings
of the honest author's inner conscience. To wit:</p>

<p>1. The reader must have equal opportunity with the detective for
solving the mystery. All clues must be plainly stated and
described.</p>

<p>2. No wilful tricks or deceptions may be played on the reader
other than those played legitimately by the criminal on the
detective himself.</p>

<p>3. There must be no love interest in the story. To introduce
amour is to clutter up a purely intellectual experience with
irrelevant sentiment. The business in hand is to bring a criminal
to the bar of justice, not to bring a lovelorn couple to the
hymeneal altar.</p>

<p>4. The detective himself, or one of the official investigators,
should never turn out to be the culprit. This is bald trickery, on
a par with offering some one a bright penny for a five-dollar gold
piece. It's false pretenses.</p>

<p>5. The culprit must be determined by logical
deductions&mdash;not by accident or coincidence or unmotivated
confession. To solve a criminal problem in this latter fashion is
like sending the reader on a deliberate wild-goose chase, and then
telling him, after he has failed, that you had the object of his
search up your sleeve all the time. Such an author is no better
than a practical joker.</p>

<p>6. The detective novel must have a detective in it; and a
detective is not a detective unless he detects. His function is to
gather clues that will eventually lead to the person who did the
dirty work in the first chapter; and if the detective does not
reach his conclusions through an analysis of those clues, he has no
more solved his problem than the schoolboy who gets his answer out
of the back of the arithmetic.</p>

<p>7. There simply must be a corpse in a detective novel, and the
deader the corpse the better. No lesser crime than murder will
suffice. Three hundred pages is far too much pother for a crime
other than murder. After all, the reader's trouble and expenditure
of energy must be rewarded. Americans are essentially humane, and
therefore a tiptop murder arouses their sense of vengeance and
horror. They wish to bring the perpetrator to justice; and when
"murder most foul, as in the best it is," has been committed, the
chase is on with all the righteous enthusiasm of which the thrice
gentle reader is capable.</p>

<p>8. The problem of the crime must be solved by strictly
naturalistic means. Such methods for learning the truth as
slate-writing, ouija-boards, mind-reading, spiritualistic
s&eacute;ances, crystal-gazing, and the like, are taboo. A reader
has a chance when matching his wits with a rationalistic detective,
but if he must compete with the world of spirits and go chasing
about the fourth dimension of metaphysics, he is defeated <i>ab
initio.</i></p>

<p>9. There must be but one detective&mdash;that is, but one
protagonist of deduction&mdash;one <i>deus ex machine</i>. To bring
the minds of three or four, or sometimes a gang of detectives to
bear on a problem is not only to disperse the interest and break
the direct thread of logic, but to take an unfair advantage of the
reader, who, at the outset, pits his mind against that of the
detective and proceeds to do mental battle. If there is more than
one detective the reader doesn't know who his co-deductor is. It's
like making the reader run a race with a relay team.</p>

<p>10. The culprit must turn out to be a person who has played a
more or less prominent part in the story&mdash;that is, a person
with whom the reader is familiar and in whom he takes an interest.
For a writer to fasten the crime, in the final chapter, on a
stranger or person who has played a wholly unimportant part in the
tale, is to confess to his inability to match wits with the
reader.</p>

<p>11. Servants&mdash;such as butlers, footmen, valets,
game-keepers, cooks, and the like&mdash;must not be chosen by the
author as the culprit. This is begging a noble question. It is a
too easy solution. It is unsatisfactory, and makes the reader feel
that his time has been wasted. The culprit must be a decidedly
worth-while person&mdash;one that wouldn't ordinarily come under
suspicion; for if the crime was the sordid work of a menial, the
author would have had no business to embalm it in book-form.</p>

<p>12. There must be but one culprit, no matter how many murders
are committed. The culprit may, of course, have a minor helper or
co-plotter; but the entire onus must rest on one pair of shoulders:
the entire indignation of the reader must be permitted to
concentrate on a single black nature.</p>

<p>13. Secret societies, camorras, mafias, <i>et al.</i>, have no
place in a detective story. Here the author gets into adventure
fiction and secret-service romance. A fascinating and truly
beautiful murder is irremediably spoiled by any such wholesale
culpability. To be sure, the murderer in a detective novel should
be given a sporting chance, but it is going too far to grant him a
secret society (with its ubiquitous havens, mass protection, etc.)
to fall back on. No high-class, self-respecting murderer would want
such odds in his jousting-bout with the police.</p>

<p>14. The method of murder, and the means of detecting it, must be
rational and scientific. That is to say, pseudo-science and purely
imaginative and speculative devices are not to be tolerated in the
<i>roman policier</i>. For instance, the murder of a victim by a
newly found element&mdash;a super-radium, let us say&mdash;is not a
legitimate problem. Nor may a rare and unknown drug, which has its
existence only in the author's imagination, be administered. A
detective-story writer must limit himself, toxicologically
speaking, to the pharmacopoeia. Once an author soars into the realm
of fantasy, in the Jules Verne manner, he is outside the bounds of
detective fiction, cavorting in the uncharted reaches of
adventure.</p>

<p>15. The truth of the problem must at all times be
apparent&mdash;provided the reader is shrewd enough to see it. By
this I mean that if the reader, after learning the explanation for
the crime, should reread the book, he would see that the solution
had, in a sense, been staring him in the face&mdash;that all the
clues really pointed to the culprit&mdash;and that, if he had been
as clever as the detective, he could have solved the mystery
himself without going on to the final chapter. That the clever
reader does often thus solve the problem goes without saying. And
one of my basic theories of detective fiction is that, if a
detective story is fairly and legitimately constructed, it is
impossible to keep the solution from all readers. There will
inevitably be a certain number of them just as shrewd as the
author; and if the author has shown the proper sportsmanship and
honesty in his statement and projection of the crime and its clues,
these perspicacious readers will be able, by analysis, elimination
and logic, to put their finger on the culprit as soon as the
detective does. And herein lies the zest of the game. Herein we
have an explanation for the fact that readers who would spurn the
ordinary "popular" novel will read detective stories
unblushingly.</p>

<p>16. A detective novel should contain no long descriptive
passages, no literary dallying with side-issues, no subtly
worked-out character analyses, no "atmospheric" preoccupations.
Such matters have no vital place in a record of crime and
deduction. They hold up the action, and introduce issues irrelevant
to the main purpose, which is to state a problem, analyze it, and
bring it to a successful conclusion. To be sure, there must be a
sufficient descriptiveness and character delineation to give the
novel verisimilitude; but when an author of a detective story has
reached that literary point where he has created a gripping sense
of reality and enlisted the reader's interest and sympathy in the
characters and the problem, he has gone as far in the purely
"literary" technique as is legitimate and compatible with the needs
of a criminal-problem document. A detective story is a grim
business, and the reader goes to it, not for literary furbelows and
style and beautiful descriptions and the projection of moods, but
for mental stimulation and intellectual activity&mdash;just as he
goes to a ball game or to a cross-word puzzle. Lectures between
innings at the Polo Grounds on the beauties of nature would
scarcely enhance the interest in the struggle between two
contesting baseball nines; and dissertations on etymology and
orthography interspersed in the definitions of a cross-word puzzle
would tend only to irritate the solver bent on making the words
interlock correctly.</p>

<p>17. A professional criminal must never be shouldered with the
guilt of a crime in a detective story. Crimes by house-breakers and
bandits are the province of the police department&mdash;not of
authors and brilliant amateur detectives. Such crimes belong to the
routine work of the Homicide Bureaus. A really fascinating crime is
one committed by a pillar of a church, or a spinster noted for her
charities.</p>

<p>18. A crime in a detective story must never turn out to be an
accident or a suicide. To end an odyssey of sleuthing with such an
anti-climax is to play an unpardonable trick on the reader. If a
book-buyer should demand his two dollars back on the ground that
the crime was a fake, any court with a sense of justice would
decide in his favor and add a stinging reprimand to the author who
thus hoodwinked a trusting and kind-hearted reader.</p>

<p>19. The motives for all crimes in detective stories should be
personal. International plottings and war politics belong in a
different category of fiction&mdash;in secret-service tales, for
instance. But a murder story must be kept <i>gem&uuml;tlich</i>, so
to speak. It must reflect the reader's everyday experiences, and
give him a certain outlet for his own repressed desires and
emotions.</p>

<p>20. And (to give my Credo an even score of items) I herewith
list a few of the devices which no self-respecting detective-story
writer will now avail himself of. They have been employed too
often, and are familiar to all true lovers of literary crime. To
use them is a confession of the author's ineptitude and lack of
originality.</p>

<p>(a) Determining the identity of the culprit by comparing the
butt of a cigarette left at the scene of the crime with the brand
smoked by a suspect.</p>

<p>(b) The bogus spiritualistic s&eacute;ance to frighten the
culprit into giving himself away.</p>

<p>(c) Forged finger-prints.</p>

<p>(d) The dummy-figure alibi.</p>

<p>(e) The dog that does not bark and thereby reveals the fact that
the intruder is familiar.</p>

<p>(f) The final pinning of the crime on a twin, or a relative who
looks exactly like the suspected, but innocent, person.</p>

<p>(g) The hypodermic syringe and the knockout drops.</p>

<p>(h) The commission of the murder in a locked room after the
police have actually broken in.</p>

<p>(i) The word-association test for guilt.</p>

<p>(j) The cipher, or code letter, which is eventually unravelled
by the sleuth.</p>
