<h1>Smothered in Corpses</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Ernest Bramah</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>The author of the following story deems it permissible to himself to
explain that the work was projected, and, indeed, almost completed, as
a 120,000 word serial of feuilleton scope, when a much-advertised
competition for stories of not more than 4000 words in length came
under his notice. Not to be deterred by the conditions, he at once set
himself to the formidable task of reducing his manuscript to
one-thirtieth of its original length. The result must, of course, be
regarded purely on its merits, but in the writer's own opinion the
process of compression has, if anything, keyed up the action to an even
tenser pitch, without in any way detracting from the interest of the
plot or circumscribing the wealth of incident.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>I. THE END OF THE BEGINNING</h2>

<p>Where had it come from?</p>

<p>I, John Beveledge Humdrum, general practitioner, of 305A,
Hammersmith Road, Kensington, had come down to breakfast on that
eventful July morning expecting nothing more exciting than eggs and
bacon with which my excellent man Perkins had regularly provided me on
similar occasions for the past eleven years.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise, therefore, on throwing open the door of the
book-case that contained my sparse collection of medical works, in
order to consult Abernethy on Biscuits, to be confronted by the
doubled-up corpse of a young man of distinguished appearance, wearing a
suit of evening clothes of the most expensive cut.</p>

<p>My thoughts flew back to the events of the previous evening in an
attempt to unravel the mystery. Had anything remarkable happened? And
then I remembered an incident, trivial enough in itself, which might
supply a clue. At about eight o'clock I had received a professional
summons, notable as being the first in my career. A heavily-veiled
woman wearing a complete set of massive ermines had descended from a
magnificently-appointed motor-car before my door. In response to her
impassioned appeal, delivered with a marked Castilian accent, I had
accompanied her to a miserable tenement dwelling in a sordid Limehouse
slum. Here, after I had reluctantly given a pledge of secrecy and
permitted myself to be blindfolded (even to this day the mingled aroma
of Enigma Vanishing Cream and frying spaghetti vividly recalls the
scene), I was taken to the bedside of my patient, a fair-haired boy of
three or four. A villainous-looking Chinaman who was in attendance gave
me to understand, partly by signs and partly in pidgin English, that
the child had swallowed a bone button. Being unacquainted with the
exact treatment of such a case I recommended his removal to the nearest
hospital. As there was nothing more to detain me I left at once,
overwhelmed by the passionate gratitude of my mysterious caller; but as
I glanced back at the corner of the disreputable street, I saw a face
charged with diabolical hatred watching me from the grimy window of the
room I had just quitted. It was the visage of the aged Chinaman, who,
but a moment before, had been bowing to me with true Oriental
deference. As I looked, rather puzzled to account for his strage
behaviour, a terrible explosion shook the ground, the front of the
house disappeared, and a singed pigtail fell at my feet.</p>

<p>Recalling all this I was on the point of ringing for Perkins in
order to question him, when something caused me to hesitate.</p>

<p>It was well that I did so. The next moment the double doors of the
French window that overlooked the bustling turmoil of Kensington's
busiest thoroughfare were flung frantically open, and there sprang into
the room a young girl whose dazzling beauty was, if possible,
heightened heightened by the breathless excitement under which she was
labouring.</p>

<p>"Dr Humdrum," she exclaimed, throwing aside the luxuriant crimson
opera cloak that had hitherto concealed the supple perfection of her
lithe form, "save me! Help me!" and a look of baffling terror wept
across her mobile features.</p>

<p>"Certainly," I stammered, bewildered for the moment by this strange
intrusion into the dull routine of my commonplace existence, "but first
let me have your name and address for entering into my caller's
book."</p>

<p>For reply she dragged from her finger a ring set with a cluster of
diamonds that had once, as I was afterwards to learn, graced the crown
of an Eastern potentate, and with impulsive generosity flung it into
the coal-scuttle.</p>

<p>"Call me Erratica," she murmured, with a slightly different look of
terror contorting her lovely features. (And here, for the sake of
brevity, I would remark that during the first seven weeks of our
strange friendship she either shook with terror or shivered with
apprehension whenever she spoke to me or I to her.) "Seek to know no
more. Only save me!"</p>

<p>I was at my wits' end. She had already, with a gesture of loathing,
hurled out of the window the glass of sal volatile which I had poured
out for her, and that exhausted the first-aid remedies with which I was
familiar.</p>

<p>"Save you from what?"</p>

<p>"From my enemies. I saw them knocking at your door. That is why I
came in by the window."</p>

<p>"Would it not have been more prudent--" I began.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she whispered, tapping her exquisitely-modelled musical
comedy teeth with her shapely Italian forefinger. "They are at hand.
Play your part well." Then, with unsuspected strength and a knowledge
of the arrangements of my modest apartment that staggered me, she tore
open the door of the book-case, flung the corpse that it contained on
to my dissecting table, and without a moment's hesitation took its
place and pulled the door to after her.</p>

<p>"Open in the name of the law!"</p>

<p>Rather perturbed as to what the fair creature required me to do, I
obeyed the summons and was relieved to see before me the burly form of
Inspector Badger of the Detective Service, an officer with whom I was
well acquainted.</p>

<p>"Rum case, that of the murdered prima-donna, Dr Humdrum," he
remarked affably. As he spoke he took a scat on the corner of the
dissecting table and thus, luckily enough, overlooked its grim burden
in the glance of keen professional scrutiny that he cast round the
room. "I thought that I'd just look you up and see if you knew anything
about it before I ordered any arrests."</p>

<p>"Murdered prima-donna!" I stammered. "I haven't even heard of it.
Surely you don't suspect--?"</p>

<p>"Suspect you?" said the Inspector with a hearty laugh. "Why, no,
sir; but as it happens a bone button, wrapped in a sheet of paper
bearing one of your prescriptions, had been used to gag the poor
creature with. That and the yard of pigtail tied round her neck are our
only clues as yet."</p>

<p>At the mention of these details I could not repress a start, which
would scarcely have escaped Badger's notice had he not been engaged at
the moment in taking a wax impression of my boots.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it," I remarked, with all the nonchalance I could
muster. "I have heard nothing. Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Senora Rosamunda de Barcelona, the celebrated Spanish singer,"
replied the Inspector. "She left Covent Garden at half-past eleven last
night, alone and wearing a crimson opera cloak."</p>

<p>"Surely that was rather late to be shopping," I interposed, with the
happy inspiration of diverting his attention. "Would not the market
then be closed?"</p>

<p>"I understand that there is a sort of play-house there, where a lot
of these foreigners appear," he replied guardedly. "By the way
now--"</p>

<p>Possibly the compromising garment lying on the floor between us
would not have caught Badger's eye had I not endeavoured to kick it
beneath the table. However, the thing was done.</p>

<p>"Ah, my old M.D. gown of the University of Ploughhandle, Ga., USA,"
I explained, with a readiness that astonishes me to this day, as I
followed the direction of his glance. "I use it as a
dressing-gown."</p>

<p>"Very natty too," he remarked. "Well, at seven this morning the
Senora was discovered propped up in the vestibule of the Hotel
Majestic, stabbed in eleven places."</p>

<p>"And the opera cloak?" I felt impelled to ask.</p>

<p>"The opera cloak had disappeared."</p>

<p>I rose to indicate that the instalment was almost complete. The
Inspector took the hint.</p>

<p>"I'll look you up later in the day if anything really baffling turns
up," he promised as he walked towards the door. Suddenly he paused and
faced the bookcase.</p>

<p>"What was that, sir? Didn't you hear a noise in the cupboard?"</p>

<p>"Search it by all means if you wish, Badger," I replied with the
utmost sangfroid, "but it only contains my zinc ointment, ammoniated
quinine and--er--a little bundle of odds and ends. As for the
noise--they have the chimney-sweep in next door."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think of doubting your word, sir," said the Inspector.
Then very coolly he locked the cupboard door without opening it and
slipped the key into his pocket. "A mere formality, but just as well to
be on the safe side," he observed.</p>

<p>When I returned to the room--I accompanied Badger to the outer door
myself--I stood for a moment considering the new complication.</p>

<p>"Deuced awkward!" I muttered, walking towards the book-case.</p>

<p>"That will be all right, sir," interposed the soft voice of Perkins
behind me. "The key of my wardrobe fits all the locks in your
sitting-room--except that of the tantalus, I should say," and he held
out the indicated object for me to take. Under what circumstances my
exemplary man had made the discovery I did not stop to investigate, but
I have no doubt that he had conscientiously listened to every word of
one if not of both conversations that morning.</p>

<p>I did not lose a moment in unlocking the door of the book-case and
throwing it widely open to release my fair visitor.</p>

<p>But the many-clawed hand of improbability had by no means relaxed
its grip on my shoulder.</p>

<p>The cupboard was empty!</p>

<p>In speechless bewilderment my gaze went round the room from one
familiar object to another in a vain attempt to solve the mystery.
There was only one possible place of concealment there. I snatched away
the coverlet that hid the stark outline on the dissecting table.
Imagine my surprise to see before me the corpse of the elderly Italian
anarchist who had offered me a throat pastille on the grand stand at
Hurlingham a month ago!</p>

<h2>II. IN THE THICK OF IT</h2>

<p>In spite of the passionate insistence with which Sybil (as I had now
grown to call her) had reiterated that I should think of her no more,
there were very few hours of the day or night that she was absent from
my thoughts.</p>

<p>The all-too-brief moment that I had held her in my arms when I
rescued her from the burning dope den in Montmorency Square had settled
my fate for ever. The emotion that swept over me when I found that we
had been decoyed together into the abandoned radium mine in Cornwall
had, if anything, deepened the conviction; and when I discovered that
it was she and no other who, at such tremendous risk to herself, had
sent me the anonymous warning that saved me from being drugged and
tattooed beyond recognition in the Bond Street beauty specialist's
salon, I admitted that something stronger than myself was shaping our
destinies.</p>

<p>The baffling enigma of Sybil's identity would alone have been
sufficient to keep her continually in my mind, even if I had been
disposed to forget. One morning, after I had vainly sought for a week,
I discovered her. She was in charge of a novelty counter in the bargain
basement of Harridge's stores, and so perfectly in harmony with her
surroundings that it seemed impossible to suspect her of playing a
part. Yet the same evening I caught her demure look of recognition
across the table of a Cabinet Minister at a dinner given in honour of a
popular Ambassador. And had not Slavonski, on the memorable occasion of
the Incog. Club raid, referred to her as "our trusty associate
Mademoiselle Zero"? but, on the other hand, Inspector Badger had placed
himself unreservedly under her guidance when she steered the
river-police motor-launch in pursuit of the desperate "Hi-Hi!" gang. It
was all very puzzling to me, plain John Humdrum, M.D., and when I now
look back over that period I see that Sybil's friendship kept me very
busy indeed.</p>

<p>Possibly something of the sort flashed across my mind one morning
when I found on my breakfast table a note addressed in Sybil's
characteristic hand. It was postmarked "Express Aerial Service. Tokio
to Aberdeen," and franked "Urgent and Frantic" in violet ink. Stamps of
the highest possible value were affixed wherever there was an inch of
space in the dear girl's usual lavish manner. The enclosure, like all
her business messages, was brief but decided.</p>

<p>"A great danger threatens," it ran. "Meet me at twelve to-night in
the Mummy Room, British Museum.--Sybil."</p>

<p>Unfortunately it was not dated.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, in a rather doubtful frame of mind that I
presented myself, shortly before midnight, at the formidable closed
gates in Great Russell Street. A printed notice, read uncertainly by an
adjacent street lamp, informed me that the galleries closed at six. As
I stood there in indecision an official emerged stealthily from the
shadow of an angle in the wall, where he had evidently been awaiting
me.</p>

<p>"That's all right, sir," was his welcome assurance, after he had
flashed the light of an electric torch several times all over me. "The
young lady has arranged everything."</p>

<p>Without further explanation he led the way across the broad moonlit
forecourt and then through several lofty galleries. Pausing before a
massive door he unlocked it, pushed me inside, and I heard the
fastening close to again with a soft metallic click.</p>

<p>Never before had the mysterious gloom of that ghostly rendezvous of
the long-forgotten dead seemed so shadow-laden.</p>

<p>Sybil--it was she--came towards me with a glad cry. "You are here!"
she exclaimed. "How splendid; but I never for a moment doubted it."</p>

<p>"But why here?" I ventured to inquire, in my obtuse blundering wav.
"Would not Moggridge's or the Azalea Court of the Frangipane have been
more up-to-date?"</p>

<p>She gave me a reproachful glance.</p>

<p>"Surely by this time you know that I am the most hunted woman in
Europe, my good man," she answered with a touch of aristocratic
insouciance. "My footsteps are being dogged by anarchists,
vendettaists, Bolsheviks, Czecho-Slovaks, Black Hands, Hidden Hands,
Scotland Yard, the Northcliffe Press and several of the more ambitious
special constables. This is literally the one spot in London where we
are safe from observation."</p>

<p>"How wonderful you are!" was wrung from me. "But will you not tell
me what it all means?"</p>

<p>In her usual cryptic fashion Sybil answered one question by
another.</p>

<p>"Will you do something for me?"</p>

<p>"Can you doubt it?" I asked reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I don't," she replied. "But all so far is insignificant compared
with this. It will demand the reticence of a Government official
combined with the resourcefulness of a District Messenger boy. This
packet must be delivered to-night to the Admiral of the Fleet,
stationed at Plyhampton. The fate of the navy, the army and the air
service are all bound up in its safe arrival."</p>

<p>"I am ready," I said simply.</p>

<p>"A yellow motor-car, with one headlight green and the other red,
will be waiting for you at the corner of Tottenham Court Road and
Oxford Street," she proceeded rapidly. "You will recognize it by the
driver wearing a crimson opera hat--that being the secret badge of the
male members of our Society. Get in and the rest is easy."</p>

<p>Even as she spoke a sudden look of terror swept across her
features.</p>

<p>I followed her agonized glance to the nearest mummy case. It was,
the label stated, that of an Egyptian priest of Mut, named Amen-Phat,
but the pair of steely eyes that I encountered looking out of the
painted mask were those of the Hindoo waiter who had upset the
discarded toothpicks into the poisoned dish of caviare at the Grand
Duke's reception.</p>

<p>I turned to convey my suspicions to Sybil, but to my surprise she
had disappeared, and when I looked again the gilt face of Amen-Phat it
had resumed its accustomed placid stare.</p>

<p>One thing was clear. In my hand I held the fateful packet directed
to the Admiral of the Fleet, and my duty was to find the driver of the
yellow car and to make a dash for the coast at all hazard.</p>

<p>As I strode towards the door I recalled the ominous sound of
re-locking that had followed my entrance. Was I in a trap?</p>

<p>Whatever had taken place, however, the door was no longer locked. It
yielded to the pressure of my hand, but only for a few inches.
Something was holding it from the other side. I exerted my strength and
in another moment I had made a sufficient opening to allow my passage.
The nature of the obstruction was then revealed. At my feet lay the
body of a man. A ray of green light fell upon his features, rendering
them ghastly and distorted, but it needed no second glance to assure me
that the corpse was that of the mysterious Ethiopian "minstrel" who had
so inexplicably greeted me as "Uncle Sam" in the Empire promenade on
boat-race night.</p>

<h2>III. THE BEGINNING OF THE END</h2>

<p>Little more remains to be told.</p>

<p>I changed cars seventeen times between London and the coast. The
loss of time was considerable, but it wiled away the monotony of the
journey, and as a precaution, together with the badness of the road, it
was effectual in throwing our pursuers off the track. Their overturned
car was found the next morning in a lime quarry below the road near
Dorsham. Beneath it was the body of the Greek curio-dealer with the
Scotch accent who had sold me the cinquecento dagger with the phial of
cholera microbes concealed in the handle. By his side lay the form of
the old-looking young gallery first-nighter. Even to this day my
frontal bone carries the scar of his well-aimed opera-glasses, on that
occasion when, in the stalls of the Hilaric during the Royal
performance, nothing but Sybil's presence of mind in flinging open her
umbrella had saved me from a fatal blow. Both were crushed almost
beyond recognition.</p>

<p>Dawn was within an hour of breaking when my seventeenth car--a
taxi-cab of obsolete pattern--broke down in the quaint old High Street
of Plyhampton. Leaving it to its fate, I went on alone to make
inquiries, and soon learned, to my delight, that the superdreadnought
Stalactite, the flag-ship of the Admiral, was lying at that moment
moored to the end of the pier. Truly fate, which had played us many
sorry tricks in the past, was on our side that night.</p>

<p>Despite the earliness of the hour, the Admiral, Sir Slocombe
Colqumondeley, received me at once in his state-room, a magnificent
apartment upholstered in green and gold. As his eyes rested on the
superscription of the packet I handed him he could not repress a slight
start, but before he had finished the reading of the message his face
had grown strangely tense. For a few minutes he paced the salon in deep
thought, then turning to an instrument he transmitted a series of
commands in quick succession. I have since learned, though I little
suspected it at the time, that the tenor of these orders was for every
ship of the fleet to clear for action.</p>

<p>Shaking off his preoccupation, Sir Slocombe turned to me with an
engaging smile.</p>

<p>"So you are my daughter Sybil's young man, Dr Humdrum?" he
exclaimed, with bluff sailor-like heartiness. "Well, well; we must see
what we can arrange after this business is over. How would
Surgeon-Major of the Fleet suit you; eh, what?"</p>

<p>A few minutes later I was leaving the pier, more bewildered by the
turn events had taken than I would care to admit, when a tall,
dignified officer, with grey mutton-chop side-whiskers, approached
me.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, but did you enter Plyhampton in a taxi-cab numbered XYZ
999?" he inquired courteously.</p>

<p>"I did," I replied, referring to the details which I had taken the
precaution to jot down on my cuff.</p>

<p>"Then it is my duty, as Warden of the Port, to put you in irons,"
and he beckoned to a master of marines.</p>

<p>"On what charge?" I demanded with some hauteur.</p>

<p>"The driver of the taxi has been found stabbed to death with his own
speed lever," he explained gravely. "Inside the vehicle was the dead
body of the notorious international spy known to the secret police as
'Mr A.' He was disguised as an elderly Chinese seaman, and was wearing,
beneath his tunic, a forged Order of the Crimson Hat of Siam."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"Well, frankly, it doesn't sound it," he admitted with unofficial
candour; "but that isn't my affair."</p>

<p>"I am Dr Humdrum," I said, producing my stethoscope, "and I live at
305A Hammersmith Road, Kensington. Surely--"</p>

<p>"That is quite satisfactory," he replied, throwing the handcuffs
into a lee scupper that stood open. "Accept my apology Hold an inquest
on the bodies as soon as you conveniently can and you have my assurance
that you will hear nothing further of this unpleasant business."</p>

<p>We are seated in the Piazzo d'Esperanto at Mentone. Sybil's head is
nestling on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Had we better not explain to them now, darling, exactly what it was
all about?" I venture to suggest.</p>

<p>"No, dearest; I don't think we better had," replies Sybil, watching
the play of the deep blue against the distant haze.</p>
