<h2><a id="bibnote"></a>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h2>

<p class="first">THE origins of this book are described in the
following passage from Edgar Wallace's autobiography
<i>People</i>:</p>
<br>

<p class="quote">"... I founded a little publishing business,
which was called "The Tallis Press." It occupied one room in
Temple Chambers, and from here I issued "Smithy" at 1s. and sold
about 30,000 copies.</p>

<p class="quote">"Emboldened by this success, I sat down to turn
a short story I had written, and which had been rejected by every
magazine in London, into a longer one. The story was called "The
Four Just Men", in which a Minister was mysteriously killed and a
prize was offered for the best explanation of his death. It was
published at 3s. 6d. I was determined, believing the story to be
good, to make some sort of reputation as a story-writer, even if
it broke me to do so. It broke me all right. I advertised in
newspapers, on hoardings, on tubes and 'buses, the superlative
merits of "The Four Just Men." The result was that, although I
sold 38,000 copies, I lost £1,400! There was, I discovered, such
a thing as over-advertising."</p>

<br>

<p class="first">The first Tallis Press edition of the book was
published in 1905; a second edition, with Wallace's solution of
the problem, followed in 1906.</p>

<p>A 64-page version of "The Four Just Men" was subsequently
printed in Street &amp; Smith's <i>New Story Magazine</i> in
March 1915. The first known American book edition was published
by Small, Maynard &amp; Co., Boston, in 1920.</p>

<p>The short story "The Rebus", which appeared in <i>Detective
Story Magazine</i> on July 2, 1927 under the title "The Four Just
Men," is presumbly a rewrite of the original rejected story.</p>

<p>"The Rebus" was reprinted two years later in <i>Again the
Three Just Men</i> (US title: <i>The Law of the Three Just
Men</i>), the sixth and last book in this series. &mdash;<span class="smcap">Roy Glashan</span>, April 2016</p>

<h2><a name="pro" id="pro">PROLOGUE &mdash; THERY'S
TRADE</a></h2>

<p class="first">IF you leave the Plaza del Mina, go down the
narrow street, where, from ten till four, the big flag of the
United States Consulate hangs lazily; through the square on which
the Hôtel de la France fronts, round by the Church of Our Lady,
and along the clean, narrow thoroughfare that is the High Street
of Cadiz, you will come to the Café of the Nations.</p>

<p>At five o'clock there will be few people in the broad,
pillared saloon, and usually the little round tables that
obstruct the sidewalk before its doors are untenanted.</p>

<p>In the late summer (in the year of the famine) four men sat
about one table and talked business.</p>

<p>Leon Gonsalez was one, Poiccart was another, George Manfred
was a notable third, and one, Thery, or Saimont, was the fourth.
Of this quartet, only Thery requires no introduction to the
student of contemporary history. In the Bureau of Public Affairs
you will find his record. As Thery, alias Saimont, he is
registered.</p>

<p>You may, if you are inquisitive, and have the necessary
permission, inspect his photograph taken in eighteen
positions&mdash;with his hands across his broad chest, full
faced, with a three-days' growth of beard, profile,
with&mdash;but why enumerate the whole eighteen?</p>

<p>There are also photographs of his ears&mdash;and very ugly,
bat-shaped ears they are&mdash;and a long and comprehensive story
of his life.</p>

<p>Signor Paolo Mantegazza, Director of the National Museum of
Anthropology, Florence, has done Thery the honour of including
him in his admirable work (see chapter on 'Intellectual Value of
a Face'); hence I say that to all students of criminology and
physiognomy, Thery must need no introduction.</p>

<p>He sat at a little table, this man, obviously ill at ease,
pinching his fat cheeks, smoothing his shaggy eyebrows, fingering
the white scar on his unshaven chin, doing all the things that
the lower classes do when they suddenly find themselves placed on
terms of equality with their betters.</p>

<p>For although Gonsalez, with the light blue eyes and the
restless hands, and Poiccart, heavy, saturnine, and suspicious,
and George Manfred, with his grey-shot beard and single eyeglass,
were less famous in the criminal world, each was a great man, as
you shall learn.</p>

<p>Manfred laid down the <i>Heraldo di Madrid</i>, removed his
eyeglass, rubbed it with a spotless handkerchief, and laughed
quietly.</p>

<p>"These Russians are droll," he commented.</p>

<p>Poiccart frowned and reached for the newspaper. "Who is
it&mdash;this time?"</p>

<p>"A governor of one of the Southern Provinces."</p>

<p>"Killed?"</p>

<p>Manfred's moustache curled in scornful derision.</p>

<p>"Bah! Who ever killed a man with a bomb! Yes, yes; I know it
has been done&mdash;but so clumsy, so primitive, so very much
like undermining a city wall that it may fall and
slay&mdash;amongst others&mdash;your enemy."</p>

<p>Poiccart was reading the telegram deliberately and without
haste, after his fashion.</p>

<p>"The Prince was severely injured and the would-be assassin
lost an arm," he read, and pursed his lips disapprovingly. The
hands of Gonsalez, never still, opened and shut nervously, which
was Leon's sign of perturbation.</p>

<p>"Our friend here"&mdash;Manfred jerked his head in the
direction of Gonsalez and laughed&mdash;"our friend has a
conscience and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only once," interrupted Leon quickly, "and not by my wish you
remember, Manfred; you remember, Poiccart"&mdash;he did not
address Thery&mdash;"I advised against it. You remember?" He
seemed anxious to exculpate himself from the unspoken charge. "It
was a miserable little thing, and I was in Madrid," he went on
breathlessly, "and they came to me, some men from a factory at
Barcelona. They said what they were going to do, and I was
horror-stricken at their ignorance of the elements of the laws of
chemistry. I wrote down the ingredients and the proportions, and
begged them, yes, almost on my knees, to use some other method.
'My children,' I said, 'you are playing with something that even
chemists are afraid to handle. If the owner of the factory is a
bad man, by all means exterminate him, shoot him, wait on him
after he has dined and is slow and dull, and present a petition
with the right hand and&mdash;with the left hand&mdash;so!'" Leon
twisted his knuckles down and struck forward and upward at an
imaginary oppressor. "But they would listen to nothing I had to
say."</p>

<p>Manfred stirred the glass of creamy liquid that stood at his
elbow and nodded his head with an amused twinkle in his grey
eyes.</p>

<p>"I remember&mdash;several people died, and the principal
witness at the trial of the expert in explosives was the man for
whom the bomb was intended."</p>

<p>Thery cleared his throat as if to speak, and the three looked
at him curiously. There was some resentment in Thery's voice.</p>

<p>"I do not profess to be a great man like you, señors. Half the
time I don't understand what you are talking about&mdash;you
speak of governments and kings and constitutions and causes. If a
man does me an injury I smash his head"&mdash;he
hesitated&mdash;"I do not know how to say it... but I mean...
well, you kill people without hating them, men who have not hurt
you. Now, that is not my way... " He hesitated again, tried to
collect his thoughts, looked intently at the middle of the
roadway, shook his head, and relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>The others looked at him, then at one another, and each man
smiled. Manfred took a bulky case from his pocket, extracted an
untidy cigarette, re-rolled it deftly and struck a government
match on the sole of his boot.</p>

<p>"Your-way-my-dear-Thery"&mdash;he puffed&mdash;"is a fool's
way. You kill for benefit; we kill for justice, which lifts us
out of the ruck of professional slayers. When we see an unjust
man oppressing his fellows; when we see an evil thing done
against the good God"&mdash;Thery crossed himself&mdash;"and
against man&mdash;and know that by the laws of man this evildoer
may escape punishment&mdash;we punish."</p>

<p>"Listen," interrupted the taciturn Poiccart: "once there was a
girl, young and beautiful, up there"&mdash;he waved his hand
northward with unerring instinct&mdash;"and a priest&mdash;a
priest, you understand&mdash;and the parents winked at it because
it is often done... but the girl was filled with loathing and
shame, and would not go a second time, so he trapped her and kept
her in a house, and then when the bloom was off turned her out,
and I found her. She was nothing to me, but I said, 'Here is a
wrong that the law cannot adequately right.' So one night I
called on the priest with my hat over my eyes and said that I
wanted him to come to a dying traveller. He would not have come
then, but I told him that the dying man was rich and was a great
person. He mounted the horse I had brought, and we rode to a
little house on the mountain... I locked the door and he turned
round&mdash;so! Trapped, and he knew it. 'What are you going to
do?' he said with a gasping noise. 'I am going to kill you,
señor,' I said, and he believed me. I told him the story of the
girl... He screamed when I moved towards him, but he might as
well have saved his breath. 'Let me see a priest,' he begged; and
I handed him&mdash;a mirror."</p>

<p>Poiccart stopped to sip his coffee.</p>

<p>"They found him on the road next day without a mark to show
how he died," he said simply.</p>

<p>"How?" Thery bent forward eagerly, but Poiccart permitted
himself to smile grimly, and made no response.</p>

<p>Thery bent his brows and looked suspiciously from one to the
other.</p>

<p>"Government, and there are men whom the Government have never
heard of. You remember one Garcia, Manuel Garcia, leader in the
Carlist movement; he is in England; it is the only country where
he is safe; from England he directs the movement here, the great
movement. You know of what I speak?"</p>

<p>Thery nodded.</p>

<p>"This year as well as last there has been a famine, men have
been dying about the church doors, starving in the public
squares; they have watched corrupt Government succeed corrupt
Government; they have seen millions flow from the public treasury
into the pockets of politicians. This year something will happen;
the old regime must go. The Government know this; they know where
the danger lies, they know their salvation can only come if
Garcia is delivered into their hands before the organisation for
revolt is complete. But Garcia is safe for the present and would
be safe for all time were it not for a member of the English
Government, who is about to introduce and pass into law a Bill.
When that is passed, Garcia is as good as dead. You must help us
to prevent that from ever becoming law; that is why we have sent
for you."</p>

<p>Thery looked bewildered. "But how?" he stammered.</p>

<p>Manfred drew a paper from his pocket and handed it to Thery.
"This, I think," he said, speaking deliberately, "is an exact
copy of the police description of yourself." Thery nodded.
Manfred leant over and, pointing to a word that occurred half way
down the sheet, "Is that your trade?" he asked.</p>

<p>Thery looked puzzled. "Yes," he replied.</p>

<p>"Do you really know anything about that trade?" asked Manfred
earnestly; and the other two men leant forward to catch the
reply.</p>

<p>"I know," said Thery slowly, "everything there is to be known:
had it not been for a&mdash;mistake I might have earned great
money."</p>

<p>Manfred heaved a sigh of relief and nodded to his two
companions.</p>

<p>"Then," said he briskly, "the English Minister is a dead
man."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap01" id="chap01">I. &mdash; A NEWSPAPER
STORY</a></h2>

<p class="first">ON the fourteenth day of August, 19&mdash;, a
tiny paragraph appeared at the foot of an unimportant page in
London's most sober journal to the effect that the Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs had been much annoyed by the receipt of
a number of threatening letters, and was prepared to pay a reward
of fifty pounds to any person who would give such information as
would lead to the apprehension and conviction of the person or
persons, etc. The few people who read London's most sober journal
thought, in their ponderous Athenaeum Club way, that it was a
remarkable thing that a Minister of State should be annoyed at
anything; more remarkable that he should advertise his annoyance,
and most remarkable of all that he could imagine for one minute
that the offer of a reward would put a stop to the annoyance.</p>

<p>News editors of less sober but larger circulated newspapers,
wearily scanning the dull columns of Old Sobriety, read the
paragraph with a newly acquired interest.</p>

<p>"Hullo, what's this?" asked Smiles of the Comet, and cut out
the paragraph with huge shears, pasted it upon a sheet of
copy-paper and headed it:</p>

<p>Who is Sir Philip's Correspondent?</p>

<p>As an afterthought&mdash;the Comet being in
Opposition&mdash;he prefixed an introductory paragraph,
humorously suggesting that the letters were from an intelligent
electorate grown tired of the shilly-shallying methods of the
Government.</p>

<p>The news editor of the <i>Evening World</i>&mdash;a
white-haired gentleman of deliberate movement&mdash;read the
paragraph twice, cut it out carefully, read it again and, placing
it under a paperweight, very soon forgot all about it.</p>

<p>The news editor of the <i>Megaphone</i>, which is a very
bright newspaper indeed, cut the paragraph as he read it, rang a
bell, called a reporter, all in a breath, so to speak, and issued
a few terse instructions.</p>

<p>"Go down to Portland Place, try to see Sir Philip Ramon,
secure the story of that paragraph&mdash;why he is threatened,
what he is threatened with; get a copy of one of the letters if
you can. If you cannot see Ramon, get hold of a secretary."</p>

<p>And the obedient reporter went forth.</p>

<p>He returned in an hour in that state of mysterious agitation
peculiar to the reporter who has got a 'beat'. The news editor
duly reported to the Editor-in-Chief, and that great man said,
"That's very good, that's very good indeed"&mdash;which was
praise of the highest order.</p>

<p>What was 'very good indeed' about the reporter's story may be
gathered from the half-column that appeared in the
<i>Megaphone</i> on the following day:</p>

<p class="headline">CABINET MINISTER IN DANGER<br> THREATS TO
MURDER THE FOREIGN SECRETARY<br> 'THE FOUR JUST MEN'<br> PLOT TO
ARREST THE PASSAGE OF THE ALIENS EXTRADITION BILL<br>
EXTRAORDINARY REVELATIONS</p><br>

<p>Considerable comment was excited by the appearance in the news
columns of yesterday's National Journal of the following
paragraph:</p>

<p class="quote">The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Sir
Philip Ramon) has during the past few weeks been the recipient of
threatening letters, all apparently emanating from one source and
written by one person. These letters are of such a character that
they cannot be ignored by his Majesty's Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs, who hereby offers a reward of fifty pounds (£50)
to any person or persons, other than the actual writer, who will
lay such information as will lead to the apprehension and
conviction of the author of these anonymous letters.</p>

<p>So unusual was such an announcement, remembering that
anonymous and threatening letters are usually to be found daily
in the letter-bags of every statesman and diplomat, that the
<i>Daily Megaphone</i> immediately instituted inquiries as to the
cause for this unusual departure.</p>

<p>A representative of this newspaper called at the residence of
Sir Philip Ramon, who very courteously consented to be seen.</p>

<p>"It is quite an unusual step to take," said the great Foreign
Secretary, in answer to our representative's question, "but it
has been taken with the full concurrence of my colleagues of the
Cabinet. We have reasons to believe there is something behind the
threats, and I might say that the matter has been in the hands of
the police for some weeks past.</p>

<p>"Here is one of the letters," and Sir Philip produced a sheet
of foreign notepaper from a portfolio, and was good enough to
allow our representative to make a copy.</p>

<p>It was undated, and beyond the fact that the handwriting was
of the flourishing effeminate variety that is characteristic of
the Latin races, it was written in good English.</p>

<p>It ran:</p>

<p class="letter">Your Excellency,&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">The Bill that you are about to pass into law is
an unjust one... It is calculated to hand over to a corrupt and
vengeful Government men who now in England find an asylum from
the persecutions of despots and tyrants. We know that in England
opinion is divided upon the merits of your Bill, and that upon
your strength, and your strength alone, depends the passing into
law of the Aliens Political Offences Bill.</p>

<p class="letter">Therefore it grieves us to warn you that unless
your Government withdraws this Bill, it will be necessary to
remove you, and not alone you, but any other person who
undertakes to carry into law this unjust measure.</p>

<p class="letter">(Signed) FOUR JUST MEN.</p><br>

<p>"The Bill referred to," Sir Philip resumed, "is of course the
Aliens Extradition (Political Offences) Bill, which, had it not
been for the tactics of the Opposition, might have passed quietly
into law last session."</p>

<p>Sir Philip went on to explain that the Bill was called into
being by the insecurity of the succession in Spain.</p>

<p>"It is imperative that neither England nor any other country
should harbour propagandists who, from the security of these, or
other shores, should set Europe ablaze. Coincident with the
passage of this measure similar Acts or proclamations have been
made in every country in Europe. In fact, they are all in
existence, having been arranged to come into law simultaneously
with ours, last session."</p>

<p>"Why do you attach importance to these letters?" asked the
<i>Daily Megaphone</i> representative.</p>

<p>"Because we are assured, both by our own police and the
continental police, that the writers are men who are in deadly
earnest. The 'Four just men', as they sign themselves, are known
collectively in almost every country under the sun. Who they are
individually we should all very much like to know. Rightly or
wrongly, they consider that justice as meted out here on earth is
inadequate, and have set themselves about correcting the law.
They were the people who assassinated General Trelovitch, the
leader of the Servian Regicides: they hanged the French Army
Contractor, Conrad, in the Place de la Concorde&mdash;with a
hundred policemen within call. They shot Hermon le Blois, the
poet-philosopher, in his study for corrupting the youth of the
world with his reasoning."</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary then handed to our representative a list
of the crimes committed by this extraordinary quartet.</p>

<p>Our readers will recollect the circumstance of each murder,
and it will be remembered that until today&mdash;so closely have
the police of the various nationalities kept the secret of the
Four Men&mdash;no one crime has been connected with the other;
and certainly none of the circumstances which, had they been
published, would have assuredly revealed the existence of this
band, have been given to the public before today.</p>

<p>The <i>Daily Megaphone</i> is able to publish a full list of
sixteen murders committed by the four men.</p>

<p>"Two years ago, after the shooting of le Blois, by some hitch
in their almost perfect arrangements, one of the four was
recognised by a detective as having been seen leaving le Blois's
house on the Avenue Kleber, and he was shadowed for three days,
in the hope, that the four might be captured together. In the end
he discovered he was being watched, and made a bolt for liberty.
He was driven to bay in a café in Bordeaux&mdash;they had
followed him from Paris: and before he was killed he shot a
sergeant de ville and two other policemen. He was photographed,
and the print was circulated throughout Europe, but who he was or
what he was, even what nationality he was, is a mystery to this
day."</p>

<p>"But the four are still in existence?"</p>

<p>Sir Philip shrugged his shoulders. "They have either recruited
another, or they are working shorthanded," he said.</p>

<p>In conclusion the Foreign Secretary said:</p>

<p>"I am making this public through the Press, in order that the
danger which threatens, not necessarily myself, but any public
man who runs counter to the wishes of this sinister force, should
be recognised. My second reason is that the public may in its
knowledge assist those responsible for the maintenance of law and
order in the execution of their office, and by their vigilance
prevent the committal of further unlawful acts."</p>

<p>Inquiries subsequently made at Scotland Yard elicited no
further information on the subject beyond the fact that the
Criminal Investigation Department was in communication with the
chiefs of the continental police.</p>

<p>The following is a complete list of the murders committed by
the Four Just Men, together with such particulars as the police
have been able to secure regarding the cause for the crimes. We
are indebted to the Foreign Office for permission to reproduce
the list.</p>

<p class="quote"><i>London</i>, October 7, 1899.&mdash;Thomas
Cutler, master tailor, found dead under suspicious circumstances.
Coroner's jury returned a verdict of 'Wilful murder against some
person or persons unknown.'</p>

<p class="quote">(Cause of murder ascertained by police: Cutler,
who was a man of some substance, and whose real name was
Bentvitch, was a sweater of a particularly offensive type. Three
convictions under the Factory Act. Believed by the police there
was a further and more intimate cause for the murder not
unconnected with Cutler's treatment of women employees.)</p>

<p class="quote"><i>Liege</i>, February 28,1900.&mdash;Jacques
Ellerman, prefect: shot dead returning from the Opera House.
Ellerman was a notorious evil liver, and upon investigating his
affairs after his death it was found that he had embezzled nearly
a quarter of a million francs of the public funds.</p>

<p class="quote"><i>Seattle</i> (Kentucky), October,
1900.&mdash;Judge Anderson. Found dead in his room, strangled.
Anderson had thrice been tried for his life on charges of murder.
He was the leader of the Anderson faction in the Anderson-Hara
feud. Had killed in all seven of the Hara clan, was three times
indicted and three times released on a verdict of Not Guilty. It
will be remembered that on the last occasion, when charged with
the treacherous murder of the Editor of the <i>Seattle Star</i>,
he shook hands with the packed jury and congratulated them.</p>

<p class="quote"><i>New York</i>, October 30, 1900.&mdash;Patrick
Welch, a notorious grafter and stealer of public moneys. Sometime

<p class="quote"><i>Paris</i>, March 4, 1901.&mdash;Madame

<p class="quote"><i>Paris</i>, March 4, 1902 (exactly a year
later).&mdash;Monsieur Gabriel Lanfin, Minister of Communication.
Found shot in his brougham in the Bois de Boulogne. His coachman
was arrested but eventually discharged. The man swore he heard no
shot or cry from his master. It was raining at the time, and
there were few pedestrians in the Bois.</p><br>

above, including the cases of Trelovitch and le Blois.)</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">It was undoubtedly a great story.</p>

<p>The Editor-in-Chief, seated in his office, read it over again
and said, "Very good indeed."</p>

<p>The reporter&mdash;whose name was Smith&mdash;read it over and
grew pleasantly warm at the consequences of his achievement.</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary read it in bed as he sipped his morning
tea, and frowningly wondered if he had said too much.</p>

<p>The chief of the French police read it&mdash;translated and
telegraphed&mdash;in Le Temps, and furiously cursed the talkative
Englishman who was upsetting his plans.</p>

<p>In Madrid, at the Café de la Paix, in the Place of the Sun,
Manfred, cynical, smiling, and sarcastic, read extracts to three
men&mdash;two pleasantly amused, the other heavy-jowled and pasty
of face, with the fear of death in his eyes.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap02" id="chap02">II. &mdash; THE FAITHFUL
COMMONS</a></h2>

<p class="first">SOMEBODY&mdash;was it Mr.
Gladstone?&mdash;placed it on record that there is nothing quite
so dangerous, quite so ferocious, quite so terrifying as a mad
sheep. Similarly, as we know, there is no person quite so
indiscreet, quite so foolishly talkative, quite so amazingly
gauche, as the diplomat who for some reason or other has run off
the rails.</p>

<p>There comes a moment to the man who has trained himself to
guard his tongue in the Councils of Nations, who has been
schooled to walk warily amongst pitfalls digged cunningly by
friendly Powers, when the practice and precept of many years are
forgotten, and he behaves humanly. Why this should be has never
been discovered by ordinary people, although the psychological
minority who can generally explain the mental processes of their
fellows, have doubtless very adequate and convincing reasons for
these acts of disbalancement.</p>

<p>Sir Philip Ramon was a man of peculiar temperament.</p>

<p>I doubt whether anything in the wide world would have arrested
his purpose once his mind had been made up. He was a man of
strong character, a firm, square-jawed, big-mouthed man, with
that shade of blue in his eyes that one looks for in peculiarly
heartless criminals, and particularly famous generals. And yet
Sir Philip Ramon feared, as few men imagined he feared, the
consequence of the task he had set himself.</p>

<p>There are thousands of men who are physically heroes and
morally poltroons, men who would laugh at death&mdash;and live in
terror of personal embarrassments. Coroner's courts listen daily
to the tale of such men's lives&mdash;and deaths.</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary reversed these qualities. Good animal
men would unhesitatingly describe the Minister as a coward, for
he feared pain and he feared death.</p>

<p>"If this thing is worrying you so much," the Premier said
kindly&mdash;it was at the Cabinet Council two days following the
publication of the <i>Megaphone</i>'s story&mdash;"why don't you
drop the Bill? After all, there are matters of greater importance
to occupy the time of the House, and we are getting near the end
of the session."</p>

<p>An approving murmur went round the table.</p>

<p>"We have every excuse for dropping it. There must be a
horrible slaughtering of the innocents&mdash;Braithewaite's
Unemployed Bill must go; and what the country will say to that,
Heaven only knows."</p>

<p>"No, no!" The Foreign Secretary brought his fist down on the
table with a crash. "It shall go through; of that I am
determined. We are breaking faith with the Cortes, we are
breaking faith with France, we are breaking faith with every
country in the Union. I have promised the passage of this
measure&mdash;and we must go through with it, even though there
are a thousand 'Just Men', and a thousand threats."</p>

<p>The Premier shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Forgive me for saying so, Ramon," said Bolton, the Solicitor,
"but I can't help feeling you were rather indiscreet to give
particulars to the Press as you did. Yes, I know we were agreed
that you should have a free hand to deal with the matter as you
wished, but somehow I did not think you would have been quite
so&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;candid."</p>

<p>"My discretion in the matter, Sir George, is not a subject
that I care to discuss," replied Ramon stiffly.</p>

<p>Later, as he walked across Palace Yard with the
youthful-looking Chancellor, Mr. Solicitor-General, smarting
under the rebuff, said, a propos of nothing, "Silly old ass." And
the youthful guardian of Britain's finances smiled.</p>

<p>"If the truth be told," he said, "Ramon is in a most awful
funk. The story of the Four Just Men is in all the clubs, and a
man I met at the Carlton at lunch has rather convinced me that
there is really something to be feared. He was quite serious
about it&mdash;he's just returned from South America and has seen
some of the work done by these men."</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"A president or something of one of these rotten little
republics... about eight months ago&mdash;you'll see it in the
list... They hanged him ... most extraordinary thing in the
world. They took him out of bed in the middle of the night,
gagged him, blindfolded him, carried him to the public jail,
gained admission, and hanged him on the public gallows&mdash;and
escaped!"</p>

<p>Mr. Solicitor saw the difficulties of such proceedings, and
was about to ask for further information when an under-secretary
buttonholed the Chancellor and bore him off. "Absurd," muttered
Mr. Solicitor crossly.</p>

<p>There were cheers for the Secretary for Foreign Affairs as his
brougham swept through the crowd that lined the approaches to the
House. He was in no wise exalted, for popularity was not a
possession he craved. He knew instinctively that the cheers were
called forth by the public's appreciation of his peril; and the
knowledge chilled and irritated him. He would have liked to think
that the people scoffed at the existence of this mysterious
four&mdash;it would have given him some peace of mind had he been
able to think the people have rejected the idea.</p>

<p>For although popularity or unpopularity was outside his scheme
of essentials, yet he had an unswerving faith in the brute
instincts of the mob. He was surrounded in the lobby of the House
with a crowd of eager men of his party, some quizzical, some
anxious, all clamouring for the latest information&mdash;all
slightly in fear of the acid-tongued Minister.</p>

<p>"Look here, Sir Philip"&mdash;it was the stout, tactless
member for West Brondesbury&mdash;"what is all this we hear about
threatenin' letters? Surely you're not goin' to take notice of
things of that sort&mdash;why, I get two or three every day of my
life."</p>

<p>The Minister strode impatiently away from the group, but
Tester&mdash;the member&mdash;caught his arm.</p>

<p>"Look here&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Go to the devil," said the Foreign Secretary plainly, and
walked quickly to his room.</p>

<p>"Beastly temper that man's got, to be sure," said the
honourable member despairingly. "Fact is, old Ramon's in a blue
funk. The idea of making a song about threatenin' letters! Why, I
get&mdash;"</p>

<p>A group of men in the members' smokeroom discussed the
question of the Just Four in a perfectly unoriginal way.</p>

<p>"It's too ridiculous for words," said one oracularly. "Here
are four men, a mythical four, arrayed against all the forces and
established agencies of the most civilised nation on earth."</p>

<p>"Except Germany," interrupted Scott, MP, wisely.</p>

<p>"Oh, leave Germany out of it for goodness' sake," begged the
first speaker tartly. "I do wish, Scott, we could discuss a
subject in which the superiority of German institutions could not
be introduced."</p>

<p>"Impossible," said the cheerful Scott, flinging loose the
reins of his hobby horse: "remember that in steel and iron alone
the production per head of the employee has increased 43 per
cent., that her shipping&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think Ramon will withdraw the bill?" asked the senior
member for Aldgate East, disentangling his attention from the
babble of statistics.</p>

<p>"Ramon? Not he&mdash;he'd sooner die."</p>

<p>"It's a most unusual circumstance," said Aldgate East; and
three boroughs, a London suburb, and a midland town nodded and
'thought it was'.</p>

<p>"In the old days, when old Bascoe was a young
member"&mdash;Aldgate East indicated an aged senator bent and
white of beard and hair, who was walking painfully toward a
seat&mdash;"in the old days&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thought old Bascoe had paired?" remarked an irrelevant
listener.</p>

<p>"In the old days," continued the member for the East End,
"before the Fenian trouble&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;talk of civilisation," went on the enthusiastic Scott.
"Rheinbaken said last month in the Lower House, 'Germany had
reached that point where&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"If I were Ramon," resumed Aldgate East profoundly, "I know
exactly what I should do. I should go to the police and say 'Look
here&mdash;'"</p>

<p>A bell rang furiously and continuously, and the members went
scampering along the corridor. "Division&mdash;'vision."</p>

<p>Clause Nine of the Medway Improvement Bill having been
satisfactorily settled and the words 'Or as may hereafter be
determined' added by a triumphant majority of twenty-four, the
faithful Commons returned to the interrupted discussion.</p>

<p>"What I say, and what I've always said about a man in the
Cabinet," maintained an important individual, "is that he must,
if he is a true statesman, drop all consideration for his own
personal feelings."</p>

<p>"Hear!" applauded somebody.</p>

<p>"His own personal feelings," repeated the orator. "He must put
his duty to the state before all
other&mdash;er&mdash;considerations. You remember what I said to
Barrington the other night when we were talking out the
Estimates? I said, 'The right honourable gentleman has not,
cannot have, allowed for the strong and almost unanimous desires
of the great body of the electorate. The action of a Minister of
the Crown must primarily be governed by the intelligent judgment
of the great body of the electorate, whose fine
feelings&mdash;no&mdash;whose higher
instincts'&mdash;no&mdash;that wasn't it&mdash;at any rate I made
it very clear what the duty of a Minister was," concluded the
oracle lamely.</p>

<p>"Now I&mdash;" commenced Aldgate East, when an attendant
approached with a tray on which lay a greenish-grey envelope.</p>

<p>"Has any gentleman dropped this?" he inquired, and, picking up
the letter, the member fumbled for his eyeglasses.</p>

<p>"To the Members of the House of Commons," he read, and looked
over his pince-nez at the circle of men about him.</p>

<p>"Company prospectus," said the stout member for West
Brondesbury, who had joined the party; "I get hundreds. Only the
other day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Too thin for a prospectus," said Aldgate East, weighing the
letter in his hand.</p>

<p>"Patent medicine, then," persisted the light of Brondesbury.
"I get one every morning&mdash;'Don't burn the candle at both
ends', and all that sort of rot. Last week a feller sent
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Open it," someone suggested, and the member obeyed. He read a
few lines and turned red.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned!" he gasped, and read aloud:</p>

<p>Citizens,</p>

<p>The Government is about to pass into law a measure which will
place in the hands of the most evil Government of modern times
men who are patriots and who are destined to be the saviours of
their countries. We have informed the Minister in charge of this
measure, the title of which appears in the margin, that unless he
withdraws this Bill we will surely slay him.</p>

<p>We are loath to take this extreme step, knowing that otherwise
he is an honest and brave gentleman, and it is with a desire to
avoid fulfilling our promise that we ask the members of the
Mother of Parliaments to use their every influence to force the
withdrawal of this Bill.</p>

<p>Were we common murderers or clumsy anarchists we could with
ease wreak a blind and indiscriminate vengeance on the members of
this assembly, and in proof thereof, and as an earnest that our
threat is no idle one, we beg you to search beneath the table
near the recess in this room. There you will find a machine
sufficiently charged to destroy the greater portion of this
building.</p>

<p>(Signed) Four Just Men</p>

<p>Postscript.&mdash;We have not placed either detonator or fuse
in the machine, which may therefore be handled with impunity.</p>

<p>As the reading of the letter proceeded the faces of the
listeners grew pallid.</p>

<p>There was something very convincing about the tone of the
letter, and instinctively all eyes sought the table near the
recess.</p>

<p>Yes, there was something, a square black something, and the
crowd of legislators shrank back. For a moment they stood
spellbound&mdash;and then there was a mad rush for the door.</p>

<p>"Was it a hoax?" asked the Prime Minister anxiously, but the
hastily summoned expert from Scotland Yard shook his head.</p>

<p>"Just as the letter described it," he said gravely, "even to
the absence of fuses."</p>

<p>"Was it really&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough to wreck the House, sir," was the reply.</p>

<p>The Premier, with a troubled face, paced the floor of his
private room.</p>

<p>He stopped once to look moodily through the window that gave a
view of a crowded terrace and a mass of excited politicians
gesticulating and evidently all speaking at once.</p>

<p>"Very, very serious&mdash;very, very serious," he muttered.
Then aloud, "We said so much we might as well continue. Give the
newspapers as full an account of this afternoon's happenings as
they think necessary&mdash;give them the text of the letter." He
pushed a button and his secretary entered noiselessly.</p>

<p>"Write to the Commissioner telling him to offer a reward of a
thousand pounds for the arrest of the man who left this thing and
a free pardon and the reward to any accomplice."</p>

<p>The Secretary withdrew and the Scotland Yard expert
waited.</p>

<p>"Have your people found how the machine was introduced?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; the police have all been relieved and been subjected
to separate interrogation. They remember seeing no stranger
either entering or leaving the House."</p>

<p>The Premier pursed his lips in thought.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said simply, and the expert withdrew.</p>

<p>On the terrace Aldgate East and the oratorical member divided
honours.</p>

<p>"I must have been standing quite close to it," said the latter
impressively; "'pon my word it makes me go cold all over to think
about it. You remember, Mellin? I was saying about the duty of
the Ministry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I asked the waiter," said the member for Aldgate to an
interested circle, "when he brought the letter: 'Where did you
find it?'</p>

<p>"On the floor, sir!" he said. "I thought it was a medicine
advertisement; I wasn't going to open it, only
somebody&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was me," claimed the stout gentleman from Brondesbury
proudly; "you remember I was saying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I knew it was somebody," continued Aldgate East graciously.
"I opened it and read the first few lines. 'Bless my soul,' I
said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You said, 'Well, I'm damned,'" corrected Brondesbury.</p>

<p>"Well, I know it was something very much to the point,"
admitted Aldgate East. "I read it&mdash;and, you'll quite
understand, I couldn't grasp its significance, so to speak.
Well&mdash;"</p>

<p>The three stalls reserved at the Star Music Hall in Oxford
Street were occupied one by one. At half past seven prompt came
Manfred, dressed quietly; at eight came Poiccart, a fairly
prosperous middle-aged gentleman; at half past eight came
Gonsalez, asking in perfect English for a programme. He seated
himself between the two others.</p>

<p>When pit and gallery were roaring themselves hoarse over a
patriotic song, Manfred smilingly turned to Leon, and said:</p>

<p>"I saw it in the evening papers."</p>

<p>Leon nodded quickly.</p>

<p>"There was nearly trouble," he said quietly. "As I went in
somebody said, 'I thought Bascoe had paired,' and one of them
almost came up to me and spoke."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap03" id="chap03">III. &mdash; ONE THOUSAND POUNDS
REWARD</a></h2>

<p class="first">TO say that England was stirred to its
depths&mdash;to quote more than one leading article on the
subject&mdash;by the extraordinary occurrence in the House of
Commons, would be stating the matter exactly.</p>

<p>The first intimation of the existence of the Four Just Men had
been received with pardonable derision, particularly by those
newspapers that were behindhand with the first news. Only the
<i>Daily Megaphone</i> had truly and earnestly recognised how
real was the danger which threatened the Minister in charge of
the obnoxious Act. Now, however, even the most scornful could not
ignore the significance of the communication that had so
mysteriously found its way into the very heart of Britain's most
jealously guarded institution. The story of the Bomb Outrage
filled the pages of every newspaper throughout the country, and
the latest daring venture of the Four was placarded the length
and breadth of the Isles.</p>

<p>Stories, mostly apocryphal, of the men who were responsible
for the newest sensation made their appearance from day to day,
and there was no other topic in the mouths of men wherever they
met but the strange quartet who seemed to hold the lives of the
mighty in the hollows of their hands.</p>

<p>Never since the days of the Fenian outrages had the mind of
the public been so filled with apprehension as it was during the
two days following the appearance in the Commons of the 'blank
bomb', as one journal felicitously described it.</p>

<p>Perhaps in exactly the same kind of apprehension, since there
was a general belief, which grew out of the trend of the letters,
that the Four menaced none other than one man.</p>

<p>The first intimation of their intentions had excited
widespread interest. But the fact that the threat had been
launched from a small French town, and that in consequence the
danger was very remote, had somehow robbed the threat of some of
its force. Such was the vague reasoning of an ungeographical
people that did not realise that Dax is no farther from London
than Aberdeen.</p>

<p>But here was the Hidden Terror in the Metropolis itself. Why,
argued London, with suspicious sidelong glances, every man we rub
elbows with may be one of the Four, and we none the wiser.</p>

<p>Heavy, black-looking posters stared down from blank walls, and
filled the breadth of every police noticeboard.</p>

<p>£1000 REWARD</p>

<p>Whereas, on August 18, at about 4.30 o'clock in the afternoon,
an infernal machine was deposited in the Members' Smoke-Room by
some person or persons unknown.</p>

<p>And whereas there is reason to believe that the person or
persons implicated in the disposal of the aforesaid machine are
members of an organised body of criminals known as The Four Just
Men, against whom warrants have been issued on charges of wilful
murder in London, Paris, New York, New Orleans, Seattle (USA),
Barcelona, Tomsk, Belgrade, Christiania, Capetown and
Caracas.</p>

<p>Now, therefore, the above reward will be paid by his Majesty's
Government to any person or persons who shall lay such
information as shall lead to the apprehension of any of or the
whole of the persons styling themselves The Four Just Men and
identical with the band before mentioned.</p>

<p>And, furthermore, a free pardon and the reward will be paid to
any member of the band for such information, providing the person
laying such information has neither committed nor has been an
accessory before or after the act of any of the following
murders.</p>

<p>(Signed)</p>

<p>Ryday Montgomery, His Majesty's Secretary of State for Home
Affairs.</p>

<p>J. B. Calfort, Commissioner of Police.</p>

<p>Here followed a list of the sixteen crimes alleged against the
four men.</p>

<p>God Save the King</p>

<p>All day long little knots of people gathered before the
broadsheets, digesting the magnificent offer.</p>

<p>It was an unusual hue and cry, differing from those with which
Londoners were best acquainted. For there was no appended
description of the men wanted; no portraits by which they might
be identified, no stereotyped 'when last seen was wearing a dark
blue serge suit, cloth cap, check tie', on which the searcher
might base his scrutiny of the passer-by.</p>

<p>It was a search for four men whom no person had ever
consciously seen, a hunt for a will-o'-the-wisp, a groping in the
dark after indefinite shadows.</p>

<p>Detective Superintendent Falmouth, who was a very plain-spoken
man (he once brusquely explained to a Royal Personage that he
hadn't got eyes in the back of his head), told the Assistant
Commissioner exactly what he thought about it.</p>

<p>"You can't catch men when you haven't got the slightest idea
who or what you're looking for. For the sake of argument, they
might be women for all we know&mdash;they might be chinamen or
niggers; they might be tall or short; they might&mdash;why, we
don't even know their nationality! They've committed crimes in
almost every country in the world. They're not French because
they killed a man in Paris, or Yankee because they strangled
Judge Anderson."</p>

<p>"The writing," said the Commissioner, referring to a bunch of
letters he held in his hand.</p>

<p>"Latin; but that may be a fake. And suppose it isn't? There's
no difference between the handwriting of a Frenchman, Spaniard,
Portuguese, Italian, South American, or Creole&mdash;and, as I
say, it might be a fake, and probably is."</p>

<p>"What have you done?" asked the Commissioner.</p>

<p>"We've pulled in all the suspicious characters we know. We've
cleaned out Little Italy, combed Bloomsbury, been through Soho,
and searched all the colonies. We raided a place at Nunhead last
night&mdash;a lot of Armenians live down there, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>The detective's face bore a hopeless look.</p>

<p>"As likely as not," he went on, "we should find them at one of
the swagger hotels&mdash;that's if they were fools enough to
bunch together; but you may be sure they're living apart, and
meeting at some unlikely spot once or twice a day."</p>

<p>He paused, and tapped his fingers absently on the big desk at
which he and his superior sat.</p>

<p>"We've had de Courville over," he resumed. "He saw the Soho
crowd, and what is more important, saw his own man who lives
amongst them&mdash;and it's none of them, I'll swear&mdash;or at
least he swears, and I'm prepared to accept his word."</p>

<p>The Commissioner shook his head pathetically.</p>

<p>"They're in an awful stew in Downing Street," he said. "They
do not know exactly what is going to happen next."</p>

<p>Mr. Falmouth rose to his feet with a sigh and fingered the
brim of his hat.</p>

<p>"Nice time ahead of us&mdash;I don't think," he remarked
paradoxically.</p>

<p>"What are the people thinking about it?" asked the
Commissioner.</p>

<p>"You've seen the papers?"</p>

<p>Mr. Commissioner's shrug was uncomplimentary to British
journalism.</p>

<p>"The papers! Who in Heaven's name is going to take the
slightest notice of what is in the papers!" he said
petulantly.</p>

<p>"I am, for one," replied the calm detective; "newspapers are
more often than not led by the public; and it seems to me the
idea of running a newspaper in a nutshell is to write so that the
public will say, 'That's smart&mdash;it's what I've said all
along.'"</p>

<p>"But the public themselves&mdash;have you had an opportunity
of gathering their idea?" Superintendent Falmouth nodded. "I was
talking in the Park to a man only this evening&mdash;a master-man
by the look of him, and presumably intelligent. 'What's your idea
of this Four Just Men business?' I asked. 'It's very queer,' he
said: 'do you think there's anything in it?'&mdash;and that,"
concluded the disgusted police officer, "is all the public thinks
about it."</p>

<p>But if there was sorrow at Scotland Yard, Fleet Street itself
was all a-twitter with pleasurable excitement. Here was great
news indeed: news that might be heralded across double columns,
blared forth in headlines, shouted by placards, illustrated,
diagramised, and illuminated by statistics.</p>

<p>"Is it the Mafia?" asked the Comet noisily, and went on to
prove that it was.</p>

<p>The <i>Evening World</i>, with its editorial mind lingering
lovingly in the 'sixties, mildly suggested a vendetta, and
instanced 'The Corsican Brothers'.</p>

<p>The <i>Megaphone</i> stuck to the story of the Four Just Men,
and printed pages of details concerning their nefarious acts. It
disinterred from dusty files, continental and American, the full
circumstances of each murder; it gave the portraits and careers
of the men who were slain, and, whilst in no way palliating the
offence of the Four, yet set forth justly and dispassionately the
lives of the victims, showing the sort of men they were.</p>

<p>It accepted warily the reams of contributions that flowed into
the office; for a newspaper that has received the stigma 'yellow'
exercises more caution than its more sober competitors. In
newspaper-land a dull lie is seldom detected, but an interesting
exaggeration drives an unimaginative rival to hysterical
denunciations.</p>

<p>And reams of Four Men anecdotes did flow in. For suddenly, as
if by magic, every outside contributor, every literary gentleman
who made a speciality of personal notes, every kind of man who
wrote, discovered that he had known the Four intimately all his
life.</p>

<p>'When I was in Italy... ' wrote the author of Come Again
(Hackworth Press, 6s.: 'slightly soiled', Farringdon Book Mart,
2d.) 'I remember I heard a curious story about these Men of
Blood... '</p>

<p>Or&mdash;</p>

<p>'No spot in London is more likely to prove the hiding-place of
the Four Villains than Tidal Basin,' wrote another gentleman, who
stuck Collins in the north-east corner of his manuscript. 'Tidal
Basin in the reign of Charles II was known as... '</p>

<p>"Who's Collins?" asked the super-chief of the <i>Megaphone</i>
of his hard-worked editor.</p>

<p>"A liner," described the editor wearily, thereby revealing
that even the newer journalism had not driven the promiscuous
contributor from his hard-fought field; "he does police-courts,
fires, inquests, and things. Lately he's taken to literature and
writes Picturesque-Bits-of-Old London and
Famous-Tombstones-of-Hornsey epics..."</p>

<p>Throughout the offices of the newspapers the same thing was
happening. Every cable that arrived, every piece of information
that reached the sub-editor's basket was coloured with the
impending tragedy uppermost in men's minds. Even the police-court
reports contained some allusion to the Four. It was the overnight
drunk and disorderly's justification for his indiscretion.</p>

<p>"The lad has always been honest," said the boy's tearful
mother; "it's reading these horrible stories about the Four
Foreigners that's made him turn out like this"; and the
magistrate took a lenient view of the offence.</p>

<p>To all outward showing, Sir Philip Ramon, the man mostly
interested in the development of the plot, was the least
concerned.</p>

<p>He refused to be interviewed any further; he declined to
discuss the possibilities of assassination, even with the
Premier, and his answer to letters of appreciation that came to
him from all parts of the country was an announcement in the
Morning Post asking his correspondents to be good enough to
refrain from persecuting him with picture postcards, which found
no other repository than his wastepaper basket.</p>

<p>He had thought of adding an announcement of his intention of
carrying the Bill through Parliament at whatever cost, and was
only deterred by the fear of theatricality.</p>

<p>To Falmouth, upon whom had naturally devolved the duty of
protecting the Foreign Secretary from harm, Sir Philip was
unusually gracious, and incidentally permitted that astute
officer to get a glimpse of the terror in which a threatened man
lives.</p>

<p>"Do you think there's any danger, Superintendent?" he asked,
not once but a score of times; and the officer, stout defender of
an infallible police force, was very reassuring.</p>

<p>"For," as he argued to himself, "what is the use of
frightening a man who is half scared of death already? If nothing
happens, he will see I have spoken the truth, and
if&mdash;if&mdash;well, he won't be able to call me a liar."</p>

<p>Sir Philip was a constant source of interest to the detective,
who must have shown his thoughts once or twice. For the Foreign
Secretary, who was a remarkably shrewd man, intercepting a
curious glance of the police officer, said sharply, "You wonder
why I still go on with the Bill knowing the danger? Well, it will
surprise you to learn that I do not know the danger, nor can I
imagine it! I have never been conscious of physical pain in my
life, and in spite of the fact that I have a weak heart, I have
never had so much as a single ache. What death will be, what
pangs or peace it may bring, I have no conception. I argue with
Epictetus that the fear of death is by way of being an
impertinent assumption of a knowledge of the hereafter, and that
we have no reason to believe it is any worse condition than our
present. I am not afraid to die&mdash;but I am afraid of
dying."</p>

<p>"Quite so, sir," murmured the sympathetic but wholly
uncomprehending detective, who had no mind for nice
distinctions.</p>

<p>"But," resumed the Minister&mdash;he was sitting in his study
in Portland Place&mdash;"if I cannot imagine the exact process of
dissolution, I can imagine and have experienced the result of
breaking faith with the chancellories, and I have certainly no
intention of laying up a store of future embarrassments for fear
of something that may after all be comparatively trifling."</p>

<p>Which piece of reasoning will be sufficient to indicate what
the Opposition of the hour was pleased to term 'the tortuous mind
of the right honourable gentleman'.</p>

<p>And Superintendent Falmouth, listening with every indication
of attention, yawned inwardly and wondered who Epictetus was.</p>

<p>"I have taken all possible precautions, sir," said the
detective in the pause that followed the recital of this creed.
"I hope you won't mind for a week or two being followed about by
some of my men. I want you to allow two or three officers to
remain in the house whilst you are here, and of course there will
be quite a number on duty at the Foreign Office."</p>

<p>Sir Philip expressed his approval, and later, when he and the
detective drove down to the House in a closed brougham, he
understood why cyclists rode before and on either side of the
carriage, and why two cabs followed the brougham into Palace
Yard.</p>

<p>At Notice Time, with a House sparsely filled, Sir Philip rose
in his place and gave notice that he would move the second
reading of the Aliens Extradition (Political Offences) Bill, on
Tuesday week, or, to be exact, in ten days.</p>

<p>That evening Manfred met Gonsalez in North Tower Gardens and
remarked on the fairy-like splendour of the Crystal Palace
grounds by night.</p>

<p>A Guards' band was playing the overture to Tannhäuser, and the
men talked music.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"What of Thery?" asked Manfred.</p>

<p>"Poiccart has him today; he is showing him the sights." They
both laughed.</p>

<p>"And you?" asked Gonsalez.</p>

<p>"I have had an interesting day; I met that delightfully naive
detective in Green Park, who asked me what I thought of
ourselves!"</p>

<p>Gonsalez commented on the movement in G minor, and Manfred
nodded his head, keeping time with the music.</p>

<p>"Are we prepared?" asked Leon quietly.</p>

<p>Manfred still nodded and softly whistled the number. He
stopped with the final crash of the band, and joined in the
applause that greeted the musicians.</p>

<p>"I have taken a place," he said, clapping his hands. "We had
better come together."</p>

<p>"Is everything there?"</p>

<p>Manfred looked at his companion with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>"Almost everything."</p>

<p>The band broke into the National Anthem, and the two men rose
and uncovered.</p>

<p>The throng about the bandstand melted away in the gloom, and
Manfred and his companion turned to go.</p>

<p>Thousands of fairy lamps gleamed in the grounds, and there was
a strong smell of gas in the air.</p>

<p>"Not that way this time?" questioned, rather than asserted,
Gonsalez.</p>

<p>"Most certainly not that way," replied Manfred decidedly.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="chap04" id="chap04">IV. &mdash;
PREPARATIONS</a></h2>

<p class="first">WHEN an advertisement appeared in the Newspaper
Proprietor announcing that there was&mdash;</p>

<p>For sale: An old-established zinco-engraver's business with a
splendid new plant and a stock of chemicals.</p>

<p>Everybody in the printing world said "That's Etherington's."
To the uninitiated a photo-engraver's is a place of buzzing saws,
and lead shavings, and noisy lathes, and big bright arc
lamps.</p>

<p>To the initiated a photo-engraver's is a place where works of
art are reproduced by photography on zinc plates, and
consequently used for printing purposes.</p>

<p>To the very knowing people of the printing world,
Etherington's was the worst of its kind, producing the least
presentable of pictures at a price slightly above the
average.</p>

<p>Etherington's had been in the market (by order of the
trustees) for three months, but partly owing to its remoteness
from Fleet Street (it was in Carnaby Street), and partly to the
dilapidated condition of the machinery (which shows that even an
official receiver has no moral sense when he starts advertising),
there had been no bids.</p>

<p>Manfred, who interviewed the trustee in Carey Street, learnt
that the business could be either leased or purchased; that
immediate possession in either circumstances was to be had; that
there were premises at the top of the house which had served as a
dwelling-place to generations of caretakers, and that a banker's
reference was all that was necessary in the way of guarantee.</p>

<p>"Rather a crank," said the trustee at a meeting of creditors,
"thinks that he is going to make a fortune turning out
photogravures of Murillo at a price within reach of the
inartistic. He tells me that he is forming a small company to
carry on the business, and that so soon as it is formed he will
buy the plant outright."</p>

<p>And sure enough that very day Thomas Brown, merchant; Arthur
W. Knight, gentleman; James Selkirk, artist; Andrew Cohen,
financial agent; and James Leech, artist, wrote to the Registrar
of Joint Stock Companies, asking to be formed into a company,
limited by shares, with the object of carrying on business as
photo-engravers, with which object they had severally subscribed
for the shares set against their names.</p>

<p>(In parenthesis, Manfred was a great artist.)</p>

<p>And five days before the second reading of the Aliens
Extradition Act, the company had entered into occupation of their
new premises in preparation to starting business.</p>

<p>"Years ago, when I first came to London," said Manfred, "I
learned the easiest way to conceal one's identity was to disguise
oneself as a public company. There's a wealth of respectability
behind the word 'limited', and the pomp and circumstance of a
company directorship diverts suspicion, even as it attracts
attention."</p>

<p>Gonsalez printed a neat notice to the effect that the Fine
Arts Reproduction Syndicate would commence business on October 1,
and a further neat label that 'no hands were wanted', and a
further terse announcement that travellers and others could only
be seen by appointment, and that all letters must be addressed to
the Manager.</p>

<p>It was a plain-fronted shop, with a deep basement crowded with
the dilapidated plant left by the liquidated engraver. The ground
floor had been used as offices, and neglected furniture and grimy
files predominated.</p>

<p>There were pigeonholes filled with old plates, pigeonholes
filled with dusty invoices, pigeonholes in which all the debris
that is accumulated in an office by a clerk with salary in arrear
was deposited.</p>

<p>The first floor had been a workshop, the second had been a
store, and the third and most interesting floor of all was that
on which were the huge cameras and the powerful arc lamps that
were so necessary an adjunct to the business.</p>

<p>In the rear of the house on this floor were the three small
rooms that had served the purpose of the bygone caretaker.</p>

<p>In one of these, two days after the occupation, sat the four
men of Cadiz.</p>

<p>Autumn had come early in the year, a cold driving rain was
falling outside, and the fire that burnt in the Georgian grate
gave the chamber an air of comfort.</p>

<p>This room alone had been cleared of litter, the best furniture
of the establishment had been introduced, and on the ink-stained
writing-table that filled the centre of the apartment stood the
remains of a fairly luxurious lunch.</p>

<p>Gonsalez was reading a small red book, and it may be remarked
that he wore gold-rimmed spectacles; Poiccart was sketching at a
corner of the table, and Manfred was smoking a long thin cigar
and studying a manufacturing chemist's price list. Thery (or as
some prefer to call him Saimont) alone did nothing, sitting a
brooding heap before the fire, twiddling his fingers, and staring
absently at the leaping little flames in the grate.</p>

<p>Conversation was carried on spasmodically, as between men
whose minds were occupied by different thoughts. Thery
concentrated the attentions of the three by speaking to the
point. Turning from his study of the fire with a sudden impulse
he asked:</p>

<p>"How much longer am I to be kept here?"</p>

<p>Poiccart looked up from his drawing and remarked:</p>

<p>"That is the third time he has asked today."</p>

<p>"Speak Spanish!" cried Thery passionately. "I am tired of this
new language. I cannot understand it, any more than I can
understand you."</p>

<p>"You will wait till it is finished," said Manfred, in the
staccato patois of Andalusia; "we have told you that."</p>

<p>Thery growled and turned his face to the grate.</p>

<p>"I am tired of this life," he said sullenly. "I want to walk
about without a guard&mdash;I want to go back to Jerez, where I
was a free man. I am sorry I came away."</p>

<p>"So am I," said Manfred quietly; "not very sorry
though&mdash;I hope for your sake I shall not be."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" burst forth Thery, after a momentary silence.
"What are you? Why do you wish to kill? Are you anarchists? What
money do you make out of this? I want to know."</p>

<p>Neither Poiccart nor Gonsalez nor Manfred showed any
resentment at the peremptory demand of their recruit. Gonsalez's
clean-shaven, sharp-pointed face twitched with pleasurable
excitement, and his cold blue eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>"Perfect! perfect!" he murmured, watching the other man's
face: "pointed nose, small forehead and&mdash;articulorum se
ipsos torquentium sonus; gemitus, mugitusque parum
explanatis&mdash;"</p>

<p>The physiognomist might have continued Seneca's picture of the
Angry Man, but Thery sprang to his feet and glowered at the
three.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked slowly. "How do I know that you are
not to get money for this? I want to know why you keep me a
prisoner, why you will not let me see the newspapers, why you
never allow me to walk alone in the street, or speak to somebody
who knows my language? You are not from Spain, nor you, nor
you&mdash;your Spanish is&mdash;yes, but you are not of the
country I know. You want me to kill&mdash;but you will not say
how&mdash;"</p>

<p>Manfred rose and laid his hand on the other's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Señor," he said&mdash;and there was nothing but kindness in
his eyes&mdash;"restrain your impatience, I beg of you. I again
assure you that we do not kill for gain. These two gentlemen whom
you see have each fortunes exceeding six million pesetas, and I
am even richer; we kill and we will kill because we are each
sufferers through acts of injustice, for which the law gave us no
remedy. If&mdash;if&mdash;" he hesitated, still keeping his grey
eyes fixed unflinchingly on the Spaniard. Then he resumed gently:
"If we kill you it will be the first act of the kind."</p>

<p>Thery was on his feet, white and snarling, with his back to
the wall; a wolf at bay, looking from one to the other with
fierce suspicion.</p>

<p>"Me&mdash;me!" he breathed, "kill me?"</p>

<p>Neither of the three men moved save Manfred, who dropped his
outstretched hand to his side.</p>

<p>"Yes, you." He nodded as he spoke. "It would be new work for
us, for we have never slain except for justice&mdash;and to kill
you would be an unjust thing."</p>

<p>Poiccart looked at Thery pityingly.</p>

<p>"That is why we chose you," said Poiccart, "because there was
always a fear of betrayal, and we thought&mdash;it had better be
you."</p>

<p>"Understand," resumed Manfred calmly, "that not a hair of your
head will be harmed if you are faithful&mdash;that you will
receive a reward that will enable you to live&mdash;remember the
girl at Jerez."</p>

<p>Thery sat down again with a shrug of indifference but his
hands were trembling as he struck a match to light his
cigarette.</p>

<p>"We will give you more freedom&mdash;you shall go out every
day. In a few days we shall all return to Spain. They called you
the silent man in the prison at Granada&mdash;we shall believe
that you will remain so."</p>

<p>After this the conversation became Greek to the Spaniard, for
the men spoke in English.</p>

<p>"He gives very little trouble," said Gonsalez. "Now that we
have dressed him like an Englishman, he does not attract
attention. He doesn't like shaving every day; but it is
necessary, and luckily he is fair. I do not allow him to speak in
the street, and this tries his temper somewhat."</p>

<p>Manfred turned the talk into a more serious channel.</p>

<p>"I shall send two more warnings, and one of those must be
delivered in his very stronghold. He is a brave man."</p>

<p>"What of Garcia?" asked Poiccart.</p>

<p>Manfred laughed.</p>

<p>"I saw him on Sunday night&mdash;a fine old man, fiery, and
oratorical. I sat at the back of a little hall whilst he pleaded
eloquently in French for the rights of man. He was a Jean-Jacques
Rousseau, a Mirabeau, a broad-viewed Bright, and the audience was
mostly composed of Cockney youths, who had come that they might
boast they had stood in the temple of Anarchism."</p>

<p>Poiccart tapped the table impatiently.</p>

<p>"Why is it, George, that an element of bathos comes into all
these things?"</p>

<p>Manfred laughed.</p>

<p>"You remember Anderson? When we had gagged him and bound him
to the chair, and had told him why he had to die&mdash;when there
were only the pleading eyes of the condemned, and the half-dark
room with a flickering lamp, and you and Leon and poor Clarice
masked and silent, and I had just sentenced him to
death&mdash;you remember how there crept into the room the scent
of frying onions from the kitchen below."</p>

<p>"I, too, remember," said Leon, "the case of the regicide."</p>

<p>Poiccart made a motion of agreement.</p>

<p>"You mean the corsets," he said, and the two nodded and
laughed.</p>

<p>"There will always be bathos," said Manfred; "poor Garcia with
a nation's destinies in his hand, an amusement for
shop-girls&mdash;tragedy and the scent of onions&mdash;a rapier
thrust and the whalebone of corsets&mdash;it is inseparable."</p>

<p>And all the time Thery smoked cigarettes, looking into the
fire with his head on his hands.</p>

<p>"Going back to this matter we have on our hands," said
Gonsalez. "I suppose that there is nothing more to be done
till&mdash;the day?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"And after?"</p>

<p>"There are our fine art reproductions."</p>

<p>"And after," persisted Poiccart.</p>

<p>"There is a case in Holland, Hermannus van der Byl, to wit;
but it will be simple, and there will be no necessity to
warn."</p>

<p>Poiccart's face was grave.</p>

<p>"I am glad you have suggested van der Byl, he should have been
dealt with before&mdash;Hook of Holland or Flushing?"</p>

<p>"If we have time, the Hook by all means."</p>

<p>"And Thery?"</p>

<p>"I will see to him," said Gonsalez easily; "we will go
overland to Jerez&mdash;where the girl is," he added
laughingly.</p>

<p>The object of their discussion finished his tenth cigarette
and sat up in his chair with a grunt.</p>

<p>"I forgot to tell you," Leon went on, "that today, when we
were taking our exercise walk, Thery was considerably interested
in the posters he saw everywhere, and was particularly curious to
know why so many people were reading them. I had to find a lie on
the spur of the minute, and I hate lying"&mdash;Gonsalez was
perfectly sincere. "I invented a story about racing or lotteries
or something of the sort, and he was satisfied."</p>

<p>Thery had caught his name in spite of its anglicised
pronunciation, and looked inquiry.</p>

<p>"We will leave you to amuse our friend," said Manfred, rising.
"Poiccart and I have a few experiments to make."</p>

<p>The two left the room, traversed the narrow passage, and
paused before a small door at the end. A larger door on the
right, padlocked and barred, led to the studio. Drawing a small
key from his pocket, Manfred opened the door, and, stepping into
the room, switched on a light that shone dimly through a
dust-covered bulb. There had been some attempt at restoring order
from the chaos. Two shelves had been cleared of rubbish, and on
these stood rows of bright little phials, each bearing a number.
A rough table had been pushed against the wall beneath the
shelves, and on the green baize with which the table was covered
was a litter of graduated measures, test tubes, condensers,
delicate scales, and two queer-shaped glass machines, not unlike
gas generators.</p>

<p>Poiccart pulled a chair to the table, and gingerly lifted a
metal cup that stood in a dish of water. Manfred, looking over
his shoulder, remarked on the consistency of the liquid that half
filled the vessel, and Poiccart bent his head, acknowledging the
remark as though it were a compliment.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, satisfied, "it is a complete success, the
formula is quite right. Some day we may want to use this."</p>

<p>He replaced the cup in its bath, and reaching beneath the
table, produced from a pail a handful of ice-dust, with which he
carefully surrounded the receptacle.</p>

<p>"I regard that as the <i>multum in parvo</i> of explosives,"
he said, and took down a small phial from the shelf, lifted the
stopper with the crook of his little finger, and poured a few
drops of a whitish liquid into the metal cup.</p>

<p>"That neutralises the elements," said Poiccart, and gave a
sigh of relief. "I am not a nervous man, but the present is the
first comfortable moment I have had for two days."</p>

<p>"It makes an abominable smell," said Manfred, with his
handkerchief to his nose.</p>

<p>A thin smoke was rising from the cup.</p>

<p>"I never notice those things," Poiccart replied, dipping a
thin glass rod into the mess. He lifted the rod, and watched
reddish drops dripping from the end.</p>

<p>"That's all right," he said.</p>

<p>"And it is an explosive no more?" asked Manfred.</p>

<p>"It is as harmless as a cup of chocolate."</p>

<p>Poiccart wiped the rod on a rag, replaced the phial, and
turned to his companion.</p>

<p>"And now?" he asked.</p>

<p>Manfred made no answer, but unlocked an old-fashioned safe
that stood in the corner of the room. From this he removed a box
of polished wood. He opened the box and disclosed the
contents.</p>

<p>"If Thery is the good workman he says he is, here is the bait
that shall lure Sir Philip Ramon to his death," he said.</p>

<p>Poiccart looked. "Very ingenious," was his only comment.
Then&mdash;"Does Thery know, quite know, the stir it has
created?"</p>

<p>Manfred closed the lid and replaced the box before he
replied.</p>

<p>"Does Thery know that he is the fourth Just Man?" he asked;
then slowly, "I think not&mdash;and it is as well as he does not
know; a thousand pounds is roughly thirty-three thousand pesetas,
and there is the free pardon &mdash;and the girl at Jerez," he
added thoughtfully.</p>

<p>A brilliant idea came to Smith, the reporter, and he carried
it to the chief.</p>

<p>"Not bad," said the editor, which meant that the idea was
really very good&mdash;"not bad at all."</p>

<p>"It occurred to me," said the gratified reporter, "that one or
two of the four might be foreigners who don't understand a word
of English."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said the chief; "thank you for the suggestion.
I'll have it done tonight."</p>

<p>Which dialogue accounts for the fact that the next morning the
<i>Megaphone</i> appeared with the police notice in French,
Italian, German&mdash;and Spanish.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap05" id="chap05">V. &mdash; THE OUTRAGE AT THE
'MEGAPHONE'</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE editor of the <i>Megaphone</i>, returning
from dinner, met the super-chief on the stairs. The super-chief,
boyish of face, withdrew his mind from the mental contemplation
of a new project (Megaphone House is the home of new projects)
and inquired after the Four Just Men.</p>

<p>"The excitement is keeping up," replied the editor. "People
are talking of nothing else but the coming debate on the
Extradition Bill, and the Government is taking every precaution
against an attack upon Ramon."</p>

<p>"What is the feeling?"</p>

<p>The editor shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Nobody really believes that anything will happen in spite of
the bomb."</p>

<p>The super-chief thought for a moment, and then quickly:</p>

<p>"What do you think?"</p>

<p>The editor laughed.</p>

<p>"I think the threat will never be fulfilled; for once the Four
have struck against a snag. If they hadn't warned Ramon they
might have done something, but forewarned&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We shall see," said the super-chief, and went home.</p>

<p>The editor wondered, as he climbed the stairs, how much longer
the Four would fill the contents bill of his newspaper, and
rather hoped that they would make their attempt, even though they
met with a failure, which he regarded as inevitable.</p>

<p>His room was locked and in darkness, and he fumbled in his
pocket for the key, found it, turned the lock, opened the door
and entered.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he mused, reaching out of his hand and pressing
down the switch of the light...</p>

<p>There was a blinding flash, a quick splutter of flame, and the
room was in darkness again.</p>

<p>Startled, he retreated to the corridor and called for a
light.</p>

<p>"Send for the electrician," he roared; "one of these damned
fuses has gone!"</p>

<p>A lamp revealed the room to be filled with a pungent smoke;
the electrician discovered that every globe had been carefully
removed from its socket and placed on the table.</p>

<p>From one of the brackets suspended a curly length of thin wire
which ended in a small black box, and it was from this that thick
fumes were issuing.</p>

<p>"Open the windows," directed the editor; and a bucket of water
having been brought, the little box was dropped carefully into
it.</p>

<p>Then it was that the editor discovered the letter&mdash;the
greenish-grey letter that lay upon his desk. He took it up,
turned it over, opened it, and noticed that the gum on the flap
was still wet.</p>

<p>Honoured Sir</p>

<p>(ran the note), when you turned on your light this evening you
probably imagined for an instant that you were a victim of one of
those 'outrages' to which you are fond of referring. We owe you
an apology for any annoyance we may have caused you. The removal
of your lamp and the substitution of a 'plug' connecting a small
charge of magnesium powder is the cause of your discomfiture. We
ask you to believe that it would have been as simple to have
connected a charge of nitroglycerine, and thus have made you your
own executioner. We have arranged this as evidence of our
inflexible intention to carry out our promise in respect of the
Aliens Extradition Act. There is no power on earth that can save
Sir Philip Ramon from destruction, and we ask you, as the
directing force of a great medium, to throw your weight into the
scale in the cause of justice, to call upon your Government to
withdraw an unjust measure, and save not only the lives of many
inoffensive persons who have found an asylum in your country, but
also the life of a Minister of the Crown whose only fault in our
eyes is his zealousness in an unrighteous cause.</p>

<p>(Signed)</p>

<p>the four just men</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled the editor, wiping his forehead and eyeing
the sodden box floating serenely at the top of the bucket.</p>

<p>"Anything wrong, sir?" asked the electrician daringly.</p>

<p>"Nothing," was the sharp reply. "Finish your work, refix these
globes, and go."</p>

<p>The electrician, ill-satisfied and curious, looked at the
floating box and the broken length of wire.</p>

<p>"Curious-looking thing, sir," he said. "If you ask
me&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't ask you anything; finish your work," the great
journalist interrupted.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, I'm sure," said the apologetic artisan.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the editor of the <i>Megaphone</i> sat
discussing the situation with Welby.</p>

<p>Welby, who is the greatest foreign editor in London, grinned
amiably and drawled his astonishment.</p>

<p>"I have always believed that these chaps meant business," he
said cheerfully, "and what is more, I feel pretty certain that
they will keep their promise. When I was in Genoa"&mdash;Welby
got much of his information first-hand&mdash;"when I was in
Genoa&mdash;or was it Sofia?&mdash;I met a man who told me about
the Trelovitch affair. He was one of the men who assassinated the
King of Servia, you remember. Well, one night he left his
quarters to visit a theatre&mdash;the same night he was found
dead in the public square with a sword thrust through his heart.
There were two extraordinary things about it." The foreign editor
ticked them on off his fingers. "First, the General was a noted
swordsman, and there was every evidence that he had not been
killed in cold blood, but had been killed in a duel; the second
was that he wore corsets, as many of these Germanised officers
do, and one of his assailants had discovered this fact, probably
by a sword thrust, and had made him discard them; at any rate
when he was found this frippery was discovered close by his
body."</p>

<p>"Was it known at the time that it was the work of the Four?"
asked the editor.</p>

<p>Welby shook his head.</p>

<p>"Even I had never heard of them before," he said resentfully.
Then asked, "What have you done about your little scare?"</p>

<p>"I've seen the hall porters and the messengers, and every man
on duty at the time, but the coming and the going of our
mysterious friend&mdash;I don't suppose there was more than
one&mdash;is unexplained. It really is a remarkable thing. Do you
know, Welby, it gives me quite an uncanny feeling; the gum on the
envelope was still wet; the letter must have been written on the
premises and sealed down within a few seconds of my entering the
room."</p>

<p>"Were the windows open?"</p>

<p>"No; all three were shut and fastened, and it would have been
impossible to enter the room that way."</p>

<p>The detective who came to receive a report of the
circumstances endorsed this opinion.</p>

<p>"The man who wrote this letter must have left your room not
longer than a minute before you arrived," he concluded, and took
charge of the letter.</p>

<p>Being a young and enthusiastic detective, before finishing his
investigations he made a most minute search of the room, turning
up carpets, tapping walls, inspecting cupboards, and taking
laborious and unnecessary measurements with a foot-rule.</p>

<p>"There are a lot of our chaps who sneer at detective stories,"
he explained to the amused editor, "but I have read almost
everything that has been written by Gaboriau and Conan Doyle, and
I believe in taking notice of little things. There wasn't any
cigar ash or anything of that sort left behind, was there?" he
asked wistfully.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," said the editor gravely.</p>

<p>"Pity," said the detective, and wrapping up the 'infernal
machine' and its appurtenances, he took his departure.</p>

<p>Afterwards the editor informed Welby that the disciple of
Holmes had spent half an hour with a magnifying glass examining
the floor.</p>

<p>"He found half a sovereign that I lost weeks ago, so it's
really an ill wind&mdash;"</p>

<p>All that evening nobody but Welby and the chief knew what had
happened in the editor's room. There was some rumour in the
sub-editor's department that a small accident had occurred in the
sanctum.</p>

<p>"Chief busted a fuse in his room and got a devil of a fright,"
said the man who attended to the Shipping List.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said the weather expert, looking up from his chart,
"do you know something like that happened to me: the other
night&mdash;"</p>

<p>The chief had directed a few firm words to the detective
before his departure.</p>

<p>"Only you and myself know anything about this occurrence,"
said the editor, "so if it gets out I shall know it comes from
Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>"You may be sure nothing will come from us," was the
detective's reply: "we've got into too much hot water
already."</p>

<p>"That's good," said the editor, and 'that's good' sounded like
a threat.</p>

<p>So that Welby and the chief kept the matter a secret till half
an hour before the paper went to press. This may seem to the
layman an extraordinary circumstance, but experience has shown
most men who control newspapers that news has an unlucky knack of
leaking out before it appears in type Wicked
compositors&mdash;and even compositors can be wicked&mdash;have
been known to screw up copies of important and exclusive news,
and throw them out of a convenient window so that they have
fallen close to a patient man standing in the street below and
have been immediately hurried off to the office of a rival
newspaper and sold for more than their weight in gold. Such cases
have been known.</p>

<p>But at half past eleven the buzzing hive of Megaphone House
began to hum, for then it was that the sub-editors learnt for the
first time of the 'outrage'.</p>

<p>It was a great story&mdash;yet another <i>Megaphone</i> scoop,
headlined half down the page with the 'Just four'
again&mdash;outrage at the office of the
<i>Megaphone</i>&mdash;devilish ingenuity&mdash;Another
Threatening Letter&mdash;The Four Will Keep Their
Promise&mdash;Remarkable Document&mdash;Will the Police save Sir
Philip Ramon?</p>

<p>"A very good story," said the chief complacently, reading the
proofs.</p>

<p>He was preparing to leave, and was speaking to Welby by the
door.</p>

<p>"Not bad," said the discriminating Welby. "What I
think&mdash;hullo!"</p>

<p>The last was addressed to a messenger who appeared with a
stranger.</p>

<p>"Gentleman wants to speak to somebody, sir&mdash;bit excited,
so I brought him up; he's a foreigner, and I can't understand
him, so I brought him to you"&mdash;this to Welby.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked the chief in French.</p>

<p>The man shook his head, and said a few words in a strange
tongue.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Welby, "Spanish&mdash;what do you wish?" he said in
that language.</p>

<p>"Is this the office of that paper?" The man produced a grimy
copy of the <i>Megaphone</i>.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Can I speak to the editor?"</p>

<p>The chief looked suspicious.</p>

<p>"I am the editor," he said.</p>

<p>The man looked over his shoulder, then leant forward.</p>

<p>"I am one of The Four Just Men," he said hesitatingly. Welby
took a step towards him and scrutinised him closely.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Miguel Thery of Jerez," replied the man.</p>

<p>It was half past ten when, returning from a concert, the cab
that bore Poiccart and Manfred westward passed through Hanover
Square and turned off to Oxford Street.</p>

<p>"You ask to see the editor," Manfred was explaining; "they
take you up to the offices; you explain your business to
somebody; they are very sorry, but they cannot help you; they are
very polite, but not to the extent of seeing you off the
premises, so, wandering about seeking your way out, you come to
the editor's room and, knowing that he is out, slip in, make your
arrangements, walk out, locking the door after you if nobody is
about, addressing a few farewell words to an imaginary occupant,
if you are seen, and voila!"</p>

<p>Poiccart bit the end of his cigar.</p>

<p>"Use for your envelope a gum that will not dry under an hour
and you heighten the mystery," he said quietly, and Manfred was
amused.</p>

<p>"The envelope-just-fastened is an irresistible attraction to
an English detective."</p>

<p>The cab speeding along Oxford Street turned into Edgware Road,
when Manfred put up his hand and pushed open the trap in the
roof.</p>

<p>"We'll get down here," he called, and the driver pulled up to
the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"I thought you said Pembridge Gardens?" he remarked as Manfred
paid him.</p>

<p>"So I did," said Manfred; "goodnight."</p>

<p>They waited chatting on the edge of the pavement until the cab
had disappeared from view, then turned back to the Marble Arch,
crossed to Park Lane, walked down that plutocratic thoroughfare
and round into Piccadilly. Near the Circus they found a
restaurant with a long bar and many small alcoves, where men sat
around marble tables, drinking, smoking, and talking. In one of
these, alone, sat Gonsalez, smoking a long cigarette and wearing
on his clean-shaven mobile face a look of meditative content.</p>

<p>Neither of the men evinced the slightest sign of surprise at
meeting him &mdash;yet Manfred's heart missed a beat, and into
the pallid cheeks of Poiccart crept two bright red spots.</p>

<p>They seated themselves, a waiter came and they gave their
orders, and when he had gone Manfred asked in a low tone, "Where
is Thery?"</p>

<p>Leon gave the slightest shrug.</p>

<p>"Thery has made his escape," he answered calmly.</p>

<p>For a minute neither man spoke, and Leon continued:</p>

<p>"This morning, before you left, you gave him a bundle of
newspapers?"</p>

<p>Manfred nodded.</p>

<p>"They were English newspapers," he said. "Thery does not know
a word of English. There were pictures in them&mdash;I gave them
to amuse him."</p>

<p>"You gave him, amongst others, the <i>Megaphone</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;ha!" Manfred remembered.</p>

<p>"The offer of a reward was in it&mdash;and the free
pardon&mdash;printed in Spanish."</p>

<p>Manfred was gazing into vacancy.</p>

<p>"I remember," he said slowly. "I read it afterwards."</p>

<p>"It was very ingenious," remarked Poiccart commendingly.</p>

<p>"I noticed he was rather excited, but I accounted for this by
the fact that we had told him last night of the method we
intended adopting for the removal of Ramon and the part he was to
play."</p>

<p>Leon changed the topic to allow the waiter to serve the
refreshments that had been ordered.</p>

<p>"It is preposterous," he went on without changing his key,
"that a horse on which so much money has been placed should not
have been sent to England at least a month in advance."</p>

<p>"The idea of a bad Channel-crossing leading to the scratching
of the favourite of a big race is unheard of," added Manfred
severely.</p>

<p>The waiter left them.</p>

<p>"We went for a walk this afternoon," resumed Leon, "and were
passing along Regent Street, he stopping every few seconds to
look in the shops, when suddenly&mdash;we had been staring at the
window of a photographer's&mdash;I missed him. There were
hundreds of people in the street&mdash;but no Thery... I have
been seeking him ever since."</p>

<p>Leon sipped his drink and looked at his watch.</p>

<p>The other two men did nothing, said nothing.</p>

<p>A careful observer might have noticed that both Manfred's and
Poiccart's hands strayed to the top button of their coats.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not so bad as that," smiled Gonsalez.</p>

<p>Manfred broke the silence of the two.</p>

<p>"I take all blame," he commenced, but Poiccart stopped him
with a gesture.</p>

<p>"If there is any blame, I alone am blameless," he said with a
short laugh. "No, George, it is too late to talk of blame. We
underrated the cunning of m'sieur, the enterprise of the English
newspapers and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The girl at Jerez," concluded Leon.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed in silence, each man thinking rapidly.</p>

<p>"I have a car not far from here," said Leon at length. "You
had told me you would be at this place by eleven o'clock; we have
the naphtha launch at Burnham-on-Crouch&mdash;we could be in
France by daybreak."</p>

<p>Manfred looked at him. "What do you think yourself?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I say stay and finish the work," said Leon.</p>

<p>"And I," said Poiccart quietly but decisively.</p>

<p>Manfred called the waiter.</p>

<p>"Have you the last editions of the evening papers?"</p>

<p>The waiter thought he could get them, and returned with
two.</p>

<p>Manfred scanned the pages carefully, then threw them
aside.</p>

<p>"Nothing in these," he said. "If Thery has gone to the police
we must hide and use some other method to that agreed upon, or we
could strike now. After all, Thery has told us all we want to
know, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That would be unfair to Ramon." Poiccart finished the
sentence in such a tone as summarily ended that possibility. "He
has still two days, and must receive yet another, and last,
warning."</p>

<p>"Then we must find Thery."</p>

<p>It was Manfred who spoke, and he rose, followed by Poiccart
and Gonsalez.</p>

<p>"If Thery has not gone to the police&mdash;where would he
go?"</p>

<p>The tone of Leon's question suggested the answer.</p>

<p>"To the office of the newspaper that published the Spanish
advertisement," was Manfred's reply, and instinctively the three
men knew that this was the correct solution.</p>

<p>"Your motor-car will be useful," said Manfred, and all three
left the bar.</p>

<p>In the editor's room Thery faced the two journalists.</p>

<p>"Thery?" repeated Welby; "I do not know that name. Where do
you come from? What is your address?"</p>

<p>"I come from Jerez in Andalusia, from the wine farm of
Sienor."</p>

<p>"Not that," interrupted Welby; "where do you come from
now&mdash;what part of London?"</p>

<p>Thery raised his hands despairingly.</p>

<p>"How should I know? There are houses and streets and
people&mdash;and it is in London, and I was to kill a man, a
Minister, because he had made a wicked law&mdash;they did not
tell me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They&mdash;who?" asked the editor eagerly.</p>

<p>"The other three."</p>

<p>"But their names?"</p>

<p>Thery shot a suspicious glance at his questioner.</p>

<p>"There is a reward," he said sullenly, "and a pardon. I want
these before I tell&mdash;"</p>

<p>The editor stepped to his desk.</p>

<p>"If you are one of the Four you shall have your
reward&mdash;you shall have some of it now." He pressed a button
and a messenger came to the door.</p>

<p>"Go to the composing room and tell the printer not to allow
his men to leave until I give orders."</p>

<p>Below, in the basement, the machines were thundering as they
flung out the first numbers of the morning news.</p>

<p>"Now"&mdash;the editor turned to Thery, who had stood,
uneasily shifting from foot to foot whilst the order was being
given&mdash;"now, tell me all you know."</p>

<p>Thery did not answer; his eyes were fixed on the floor.</p>

<p>"There is a reward and a pardon," he muttered doggedly.</p>

<p>"Hasten!" cried Welby. "You will receive your reward and the
pardon also. Tell us, who are the Four Just Men? Who are the
other three? Where are they to be found?"</p>

<p>"Here," said a clear voice behind him; and he turned as a
stranger, closing the door as he entered, stood facing the three
men&mdash;a stranger in evening dress, masked from brow to
chin.</p>

<p>There was a revolver in the hand that hung at his side.</p>

<p>"I am one," repeated the stranger calmly; "there are two
others waiting outside the building."</p>

<p>"How did you get here&mdash;what do you want?" demanded the
editor, and stretched his hand to an open drawer in his desk.</p>

<p>"Take your hand away"&mdash;and the thin barrel of the
revolver rose with a jerk. "How I came here your doorkeeper will
explain, when he recovers consciousness. Why I am here is because
I wish to save my life&mdash;not an unreasonable wish. If Thery
speaks I may be a dead man&mdash;I am about to prevent him
speaking. I have no quarrel with either of you gentlemen, but if
you hinder me I shall kill you," he said simply. He spoke all the
while in English, and Thery, with wide-stretched eyes and
distended nostrils, shrank back against the wall, breathing
quickly.</p>

<p>"You," said the masked man, turning to the terror-stricken
informer and speaking in Spanish, "would have betrayed your
comrades&mdash;you would have thwarted a great purpose, therefore
it is just that you should die."</p>

<p>He raised the revolver to the level of Thery's breast, and
Thery fell on his knees, mouthing the prayer he could not
articulate.</p>

<p>"By God&mdash;no!" cried the editor, and sprang forward.</p>

<p>The revolver turned on him.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the unknown&mdash;and his voice sank almost to a
whisper&mdash;"for God's sake do not force me to kill you."</p>

<p>"You shall not commit a cold-blooded murder," cried the editor
in a white heat of anger, and moved forward, but Welby held him
back. "What is the use?" said Welby in an undertone; "he means
it&mdash;we can do nothing."</p>

<p>"You can do something," said the stranger, and his revolver
dropped to his side.</p>

<p>Before the editor could answer there was a knock at the
door.</p>

<p>"Say you are busy"; and the revolver covered Thery, who was a
whimpering, huddled heap by the wall.</p>

<p>"Go away," shouted the editor, "I am busy."</p>

<p>"The printers are waiting," said the voice of the
messenger.</p>

<p>"Now," asked the chief, as the footsteps of the boy died away;
"what can we do?"</p>

<p>"You can save this man's life."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Give me your word of honour that you will allow us both to
depart, and will neither raise an alarm nor leave this room for a
quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>The editor hesitated.</p>

<p>"How do I know that the murder you contemplate will not be
committed as soon as you get clear?"</p>

<p>The other laughed under his mask.</p>

<p>"How do I know that as soon as I have left the room you will
not raise an alarm?"</p>

<p>"I should have given my word, sir," said the editor
stiffly.</p>

<p>"And I mine," was the quiet response; "And my word has never
been broken."</p>

<p>In the editor's mind a struggle was going on; here in his hand
was the greatest story of the century; another minute and he
would have extracted from Thery the secret of the Four.</p>

<p>Even now a bold dash might save everything&mdash;and the
printers were waiting... but the hand that held the revolver was
the hand of a resolute man, and the chief yielded.</p>

<p>"I agree, but under protest," he said. "I warn you that your
arrest and punishment is inevitable."</p>

<p>"I regret," said the masked man with a slight bow, "that I
cannot agree with you&mdash;nothing is inevitable save death.
Come, Thery," he said, speaking in Spanish. "On my word as a
Caballero I will not harm you."</p>

<p>Thery hesitated, then slunk forward with his head bowed and
his eyes fixed on the floor.</p>

<p>The masked man opened the door an inch, listened, and in the
moment came the inspiration of the editor's life.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said quickly, the man giving place to the
journalist, "when you get home will you write us an article about
yourselves? You needn't give us any embarrassing particulars, you
know&mdash;something about your aspirations, your raison
d'etre"</p>

<p>"Sir," said the masked man&mdash;and there was a note of
admiration in his voice&mdash;"I recognise in you an artist. The
article will be delivered tomorrow"; and opening the door the two
men stepped into the darkened corridor.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap06" id="chap06">VI. &mdash; THE CLUES</a></h2>

<p class="first">BLOOD-RED placards, hoarse newsboys,
overwhelming headlines, and column after column of leaded type
told the world next day how near the Four had been to capture.
Men in the train leant forward, their newspapers on their knees,
and explained what they would have done had they been in the
editor of the <i>Megaphone</i>'s position. People stopped talking
about wars and famines and droughts and street accidents and
parliaments and ordinary everyday murders and the German Emperor,
in order to concentrate their minds upon the topic of the hour.
Would the Four Just Men carry out their promise and slay the
Secretary for Foreign Affairs on the morrow?</p>

<p>Nothing else was spoken about. Here was a murder threatened a
month ago, and, unless something unforeseen happened, to be
committed tomorrow.</p>

<p>No wonder that the London Press devoted the greater part of
its space to discussing the coming of Thery and his
recapture.</p>

<p>'... It is not so easy to understand,' said the Telegram,
'why, having the miscreants in their hands, certain journalists
connected with a sensational and halfpenny contemporary allowed
them to go free to work their evil designs upon a great statesman
whose unparalleled... We say if, for unfortunately in these days
of cheap journalism every story emanating from the sanctum
sanctorum of sensation-loving sheets is not to be accepted on its
pretensions; so if, as it stated, these desperadoes really did
visit the office of a contemporary last night...' At noonday
Scotland Yard circulated a hastily printed sheet:</p>

<p>£1000 REWARD</p>

<p>Wanted, on suspicion of being connected with a criminal
organisation known as the Four Just Men, MIGUEL THERY, alias
SAIMONT, alias LE CHICO, late of Jerez, Spain, a Spaniard
speaking no English. Height 5 feet 8 inches. Eyes brown, hair
black, slight black moustache, face broad. Scars: white scar on
cheek, old knife wound on body. Figure, thick-set.</p>

<p>The above reward will be paid to any person or persons who
shall give such information as shall lead to the identification
of the said Thery with the band known as the Four Just Men and
his apprehension.</p>

<p>From which may be gathered that, acting on the information
furnished by the editor and his assistant at two o'clock in the
morning, the Direct Spanish Cable had been kept busy; important
personages had been roused from their beds in Madrid, and the
history of Thery as recorded in the Bureau had been reconstructed
from pigeon-hole records for the enlightenment of an energetic
Commissioner of Police.</p>

<p>Sir Philip Ramon, sitting writing in his study at Portland
Place, found a difficulty in keeping his mind upon the letter
that lay before him. It was a letter addressed to his agent at
Branfell, the huge estate over which he, in the years he was out
of office, played squire. Neither wife nor chick nor child had
Sir Philip. '... If by any chance these men succeed in carrying
out their purpose I have made ample provision not only for
yourself but for all who have rendered me faithful service,' he
wrote&mdash;from which may be gathered the tenor of his
letter.</p>

<p>During these past few weeks, Sir Philip's feelings towards the
possible outcome of his action had undergone a change.</p>

<p>The irritation of a constant espionage, friendly on the one
hand, menacing on the other, had engendered so bitter a feeling
of resentment, that in this newer emotion all personal fear had
been swallowed up. His mind was filled with one unswerving
determination, to carry through the measure he had in hand, to
thwart the Four Just Men, and to vindicate the integrity of a
Minister of the Crown. 'It would be absurd,' he wrote in the
course of an article entitled Individuality in its Relation to
the Public Service, and which was published some months later in
the Quarterly Review&mdash;'it would be monstrous to suppose that
incidental criticism from a wholly unauthoritative source should
affect or in any way influence a member of the Government in his
conception of the legislation necessary for the millions of
people entrusted to his care. He is the instrument, duly
appointed, to put into tangible form the wishes and desires of
those who naturally look to him not only to furnish means and
methods for the betterment of their conditions, or the
amelioration of irksome restrictions upon international
commercial relations, but to find them protection from risks
extraneous of purely commercial liabilities... in such a case a
Minister of the Crown with a due appreciation of his
responsibilities ceases to exist as a man and becomes merely an
unhuman automaton.'</p>

<p>Sir Philip Ramon was a man with very few friends. He had none
of the qualities that go to the making of a popular man. He was
an honest man, a conscientious man, a strong man. He was the
cold-blooded, cynical creature that a life devoid of love had
left him. He had no enthusiasm&mdash;and inspired none. Satisfied
that a certain procedure was less wrong than any other, he
adopted it. Satisfied that a measure was for the immediate or
ultimate good of his fellows, he carried that measure through to
the bitter end. It may be said of him that he had no
ambitions&mdash;only aims. He was the most dangerous man in the
Cabinet, which he dominated in his masterful way, for he knew not
the meaning of the blessed word 'compromise'.</p>

<p>If he held views on any subject under the sun, those views
were to be the views of his colleagues.</p>

<p>Four times in the short history of the administration had
Rumoured Resignation of a Cabinet Minister filled the placards of
the newspapers, and each time the Minister whose resignation was
ultimately recorded was the man whose views had clashed with the
Foreign Secretary. In small things, as in great, he had his
way.</p>

<p>His official residence he absolutely refused to occupy, and
No. 44 Downing Street was converted into half office, half
palace. Portland Place was his home, and from there he drove
every morning, passing the Horse Guards clock as it finished the
last stroke of ten.</p>

<p>A private telephone wire connected his study in Portland Place
with the official residence, and but for this Sir Philip had cut
himself adrift from the house in Downing Street, to occupy which
had been the ambition of the great men of his party.</p>

<p>Now, however, with the approach of the day on which every
effort would be taxed, the police insisted upon his taking up his
quarters in Downing Street.</p>

<p>Here, they said, the task of protecting the Minister would be
simplified. No. 44 Downing Street they knew. The approaches could
be better guarded, and, moreover, the drive&mdash;that dangerous
drive!&mdash;between Portland Place and the Foreign Office would
be obviated.</p>

<p>It took a considerable amount of pressure and pleading to
induce Sir Philip to take even this step, and it was only when it
was pointed out that the surveillance to which he was being
subjected would not be so apparent to himself that he
yielded.</p>

<p>"You don't like to find my men outside your door with your
shaving water," said Superintendent Falmouth bluntly. "You
objected to one of my men being in your bathroom when you went in
the other morning, and you complained about a plain-clothes
officer driving on your box&mdash;well, Sir Philip, in Downing
Street I promise that you shan't even see them."</p>

<p>This clinched the argument.</p>

<p>It was just before leaving Portland Place to take up his new
quarters that he sat writing to his agent whilst the detective
waited outside the door.</p>

<p>The telephone at Sir Philip's elbow buzzed&mdash;he hated
bells&mdash;and the voice of his private secretary asked with
some anxiety how long he would be.</p>

<p>"We have got sixty men on duty at 44," said the secretary,
zealous and young, "and today and tomorrow we shall&mdash;" And
Sir Philip listened with growing impatience to the recital.</p>

<p>"I wonder you have not got an iron safe to lock me in," he
said petulantly, and closed the conversation.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door and Falmouth put his head
inside.</p>

<p>"I don't want to hurry you, sir," he said, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>So the Foreign Secretary drove off to Downing Street in
something remarkably like a temper.</p>

<p>For he was not used to being hurried, or taken charge of, or
ordered hither and thither. It irritated him further to see the
now familiar cyclists on either side of the carriage, to
recognise at every few yards an obvious policeman in mufti
admiring the view from the sidewalk, and when he came to Downing
Street and found it barred to all carriages but his own, and an
enormous crowd of morbid sightseers gathered to cheer his
ingress, he felt as he had never felt before in his
life&mdash;humiliated.</p>

<p>He found his secretary waiting in his private office with the
rough draft of the speech that was to introduce the second
reading of the Extradition Bill.</p>

<p>"We are pretty sure to meet with a great deal of opposition,"
informed the secretary, "but Mainland has sent out three-line
whips, and expects to get a majority of thirty-six&mdash;at the
very least."</p>

<p>Ramon read over the notes and found them refreshing.</p>

<p>They brought back the old feeling of security and importance.
After all, he was a great Minister of State. Of course the
threats were too absurd&mdash;the police were to blame for making
so much fuss; and of course the Press&mdash;yes, that was
it&mdash;a newspaper sensation.</p>

<p>There was something buoyant, something almost genial in his
air, when he turned with a half smile to his secretary.</p>

<p>"Well, what about my unknown friends&mdash;what do the
blackguards call themselves?&mdash;the Four Just Men?"</p>

<p>Even as he spoke he was acting a part; he had not forgotten
their title, it was with him day and night.</p>

<p>The secretary hesitated; between his chief and himself the
Four Just Men had been a tabooed subject.</p>

<p>"They&mdash;oh, we've heard nothing more than you have read,"
he said lamely; "we know now who Thery is, but we can't place his
three companions."</p>

<p>The Minister pursed his lips.</p>

<p>"They give me till tomorrow night to recant," he said.</p>

<p>"You have heard from them again?"</p>

<p>"The briefest of notes," said Sir Philip lightly.</p>

<p>"And otherwise?"</p>

<p>Sir Philip frowned. "They will keep their promise," he said
shortly, for the 'otherwise' of his secretary had sent a coldness
into his heart that he could not quite understand.</p>

<p>In the top room in the workshop at Carnaby Street, Thery,
subdued, sullen, fearful, sat facing the three. "I want you to
quite understand," said Manfred, "that we bear you no ill-will
for what you have done. I think, and Señor Poiccart thinks, that
Señor Gonsalez did right to spare your life and bring you back to
us."</p>

<p>Thery dropped his eyes before the half-quizzical smile of the
speaker.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow night you will do as you agreed to do&mdash;if the
necessity still exists. Then you will go&mdash;" he paused.</p>

<p>"Where?" demanded Thery in sudden rage. "Where in the name of
Heaven? I have told them my name, they will know who I
am&mdash;they will find that by writing to the police. Where am I
to go?"</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet, glowering on the three men, his hands
trembling with rage, his great frame shaking with the intensity
of his anger.</p>

<p>"You betrayed yourself," said Manfred quietly; "that is your
punishment. But we will find a place for you, a new Spain under
other skies&mdash;and the girl at Jerez shall be there waiting
for you."</p>

<p>Thery looked from one to the other suspiciously. Were they
laughing at him?</p>

<p>There was no smile on their faces; Gonsalez alone looked at
him with keen, inquisitive eyes, as though he saw some hidden
meaning in the speech.</p>

<p>"Will you swear that?" asked Thery hoarsely, "will you swear
that by the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I promise that&mdash;if you wish it I will swear it," said
Manfred. "And now," he went on, his voice changing, "you know
what is expected of you tomorrow night&mdash;what you have to
do?"</p>

<p>Thery nodded.</p>

<p>"There must be no hitch&mdash;no bungling; you and I and
Poiccart and Gonsalez will kill this unjust man in a way that the
world will never guess &mdash;such an execution as shall appall
mankind. A swift death, a sure death, a death that will creep
through cracks, that will pass by the guards unnoticed. Why,
there never has been such a thing done&mdash;such&mdash;" he
stopped dead with flushed cheeks and kindling eyes, and met the
gaze of his two companions. Poiccart impassive, sphinxlike, Leon
interested and analytic. Manfred's face went a duller red.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he said almost humbly; "for the moment I had
forgotten the cause, and the end, in the strangeness of the
means."</p>

<p>He raised his hand deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"It is understandable," said Poiccart gravely, and Leon
pressed Manfred's arm.</p>

<p>The three stood in embarrassed silence for a moment, then
Manfred laughed.</p>

<p>"To work!" he said, and led the way to the improvised
laboratory.</p>

<p>Inside Thery took off his coat. Here was his province, and
from being the cowed dependant he took charge of the party,
directing them, instructing, commanding, until he had the men of
whom, a few minutes before, he had stood in terror, running from
studio to laboratory, from floor to floor.</p>

<p>There was much to be done, much testing, much calculating,
many little sums to be worked out on paper, for in the killing of
Sir Philip Ramon all the resources of modern science were to be
pressed into the service of the Four.</p>

<p>"I am going to survey the land," said Manfred suddenly, and
disappearing into the studio returned with a pair of step-ladders.
These he straddled in the dark passage, and mounting
quickly pushed up a trapdoor that led to the flat roof of the
building.</p>

<p>He pulled himself up carefully, crawled along the leaden
surface, and raising himself cautiously looked over the low
parapet.</p>

<p>He was in the centre of a half mile circle of uneven roofs.
Beyond the circumference of his horizon London loomed murkily
through smoke and mist. Below was a busy street. He took a hasty
survey of the roof with its chimney stacks, its unornamental
telegraph pole, its leaden floor and rusty guttering; then,
through a pair of field-glasses, made a long, careful survey
southward. He crawled slowly back to the trapdoor, raised it, and
let himself down very gingerly till his feet touched the top of
the ladder. Then he descended rapidly, closing the door after
him.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Thery with something of triumph in his
voice.</p>

<p>"I see you have labelled it," said Manfred.</p>

<p>"It is better so&mdash;since we shall work in the dark," said
Thery.</p>

<p>"Did you see then&mdash;?" began Poiccart.</p>

<p>Manfred nodded.</p>

<p>"Very indistinctly&mdash;one could just see the Houses of
Parliament dimly, and Downing Street is a jumble of roofs."</p>

<p>Thery had turned to the work that was engaging his attention.
Whatever was his trade he was a deft workman. Somehow he felt
that he must do his best for these men. He had been made forcibly
aware of their superiority in the last days, he had now an
ambition to assert his own skill, his individuality, and to earn
commendation from these men who had made him feel his
littleness.</p>

<p>Manfred and the others stood aside and watched him in silence.
Leon, with a perplexed frown, kept his eyes fixed on the
workman's face. For Leon Gonsalez, scientist, physiognomist (his
translation of the Theologi Physiognomia Humana of Lequetius is
regarded today as the finest), was endeavouring to reconcile the
criminal with the artisan.</p>

<p>After a while Thery finished.</p>

<p>"All is now ready," he said with a grin of satisfaction: "let
me find your Minister of State, give me a minute's speech with
him, and the next minute he dies."</p>

<p>His face, repulsive in repose, was now demoniacal. He was like
some great bull from his own country made more terrible with the
snuffle of blood in his nostrils.</p>

<p>In strange contrast were the faces of his employers. Not a
muscle of either face stirred. There was neither exultation nor
remorse in their expressions&mdash;only a curious something that
creeps into the set face of the judge as he pronounces the dread
sentence of the law. Thery saw that something, and it froze him
to his very marrow.</p>

<p>He threw up his hands as if to ward them off.</p>

<p>"Stop! stop!" he shouted; "don't look like that, in the name
of God &mdash;don't, don't!" He covered his face with shaking
hands.</p>

<p>"Like what, Thery?" asked Leon softly.</p>

<p>Thery shook his head.</p>

<p>"I cannot say&mdash;like the judge at Granada when he
says&mdash;when he says, 'Let the thing be done!'"</p>

<p>"If we look so," said Manfred harshly, "it is because we are
judges&mdash;and not alone judges but executioners of our
judgment."</p>

<p>"I thought you would have been pleased," whimpered Thery.</p>

<p>"You have done well," said Manfred gravely.</p>

<p>"Bueno, bueno!" echoed the others.</p>

<p>"Pray God that we are successful," added Manfred solemnly, and
Thery stared at this strange man in amazement.</p>

<p>Superintendent Falmouth reported to the Commissioner that
afternoon that all arrangements were now complete for the
protection of the threatened Minister.</p>

<p>"I've filled up 44 Downing Street," he said; "there's
practically a man in every room. I've got four of our best men on
the roof, men in the basement, men in the kitchens."</p>

<p>"What about the servants?" asked the Commissioner.</p>

<p>"Sir Philip has brought up his own people from the country,
and now there isn't a person in the house from the private
secretary to the doorkeeper whose name and history I do not know
from A to Z."</p>

<p>The Commissioner breathed an anxious sigh.</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad when tomorrow is over," he said. "What
are the final arrangements?"</p>

<p>"There has been no change, sir, since we fixed things up the
morning Sir Philip came over. He remains at 44 all day tomorrow
until half past eight, goes over to the House at nine to move the
reading of the Bill, returns at eleven."</p>

<p>"I have given orders for the traffic to be diverted along the
Embankment between a quarter to nine and a quarter after, and the
same at eleven," said the Commissioner. "Four closed carriages
will drive from Downing Street to the House, Sir Philip will
drive down in a car immediately afterwards."</p>

<p>There was a rap at the door&mdash;the conversation took place
in the Commissioner's office&mdash;and a police officer entered.
He bore a card in his hand, which he laid upon the table.</p>

<p>"Señor Jose di Silva," read the Commissioner, "the Spanish
Chief of Police," he explained to the Superintendent. "Show him
in, please."</p>

<p>Señor di Silva, a lithe little man, with a pronounced nose and
a beard, greeted the Englishmen with the exaggerated politeness
that is peculiar to Spanish official circles.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to bring you over," said the Commissioner, after
he had shaken hands with the visitor and had introduced him to
Falmouth; "we thought you might be able to help us in our search
for Thery."</p>

<p>"Luckily I was in Paris," said the Spaniard; "yes, I know
Thery, and I am astounded to find him in such distinguished
company. Do I know the Four?"&mdash;his shoulders went up to his
ears&mdash;"who does? I know of them&mdash;there was a case at
Malaga, you know?... Thery is not a good criminal. I was
astonished to learn that he had joined the band."</p>

<p>"By the way," said the chief, picking up a copy of the police
notice that lay on his desk, and running his eye over it, "your
people omitted to say&mdash;although it really isn't of very
great importance&mdash;what is Thery's trade?"</p>

<p>The Spanish policeman knitted his brow.</p>

<p>"Thery's trade! Let me remember." He thought for a moment.
"Thery's trade? I don't think I know; yet I have an idea that it
is something to do with rubber. His first crime was stealing
rubber; but if you want to know for certain&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Commissioner laughed.</p>

<p>"It really isn't at all important," he said lightly.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap07" id="chap07">VII. &mdash; THE MESSENGER OF
THE FOUR</a></h2>

<p class="first">THERE was yet another missive to be handed to
the doomed Minister. In the last he had received there had
occurred the sentence: One more warning you shall receive, and so
that we may be assured it shall not go astray, our next and last
message shall be delivered into your hands by one of us in
person.</p>

<p>This passage afforded the police more comfort than had any
episode since the beginning of the scare. They placed a curious
faith in the honesty of the Four Men; they recognised that these
were not ordinary criminals and that their pledge was inviolable.
Indeed, had they thought otherwise the elaborate precautions that
they were taking to ensure the safety of Sir Philip would not
have been made. The honesty of the Four was their most terrible
characteristic.</p>

<p>In this instance it served to raise a faint hope that the men
who were setting at defiance the establishment of the law would
overreach themselves. The letter conveying this message was the
one to which Sir Philip had referred so airily in his
conversation with his secretary. It had come by post, bearing the
date mark, Balham, 12.15.</p>

<p>"The question is, shall we keep you absolutely surrounded, so
that these men cannot by any possible chance carry out their
threat?" asked Superintendent Falmouth in some perplexity, "or
shall we apparently relax our vigilance in order to lure one of
the Four to his destruction?"</p>

<p>The question was directed to Sir Philip Ramon as he sat
huddled up in the capacious depths of his office chair.</p>

<p>"You want to use me as a bait?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>The detective expostulated.</p>

<p>"Not exactly that, sir; we want to give these men a
chance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand perfectly," said the Minister, with some show of
irritation.</p>

<p>The detective resumed:</p>

<p>"We know now how the infernal machine was smuggled into the
House; on the day on which the outrage was committed an old
member, Mr. Bascoe, the member for North Torrington, was seen to
enter the House."</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Sir Philip in surprise.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bascoe was never within a hundred miles of the House of
Commons on that date," said the detective quietly. "We might
never have found it out, for his name did not appear in the
division list. We've been working quietly on that House of
Commons affair ever since, and it was only a couple of days ago
that we made the discovery."</p>

<p>Sir Philip sprang from his chair and nervously paced the floor
of his room.</p>

<p>"Then they are evidently well acquainted with the conditions
of life in England," he asserted rather than asked.</p>

<p>"Evidently; they've got the lay of the land, and that is one
of the dangers of the situation."</p>

<p>"But," frowned the other, "you have told me there were no
dangers, no real dangers."</p>

<p>"There is this danger, sir," replied the detective, eyeing the
Minister steadily, and dropping his voice as he spoke, "men who
are capable of making such disguise are really outside the
ordinary run of criminals. I don't know what their game is, but
whatever it is, they are playing it thoroughly. One of them is
evidently an artist at that sort of thing, and he's the man I'm
afraid of&mdash;today."</p>

<p>Sir Philip's head tossed impatiently.</p>

<p>"I am tired of all this, tired of it"&mdash;and he thrashed
the edge of his desk with an open palm&mdash;"detectives and
disguises and masked murderers until the atmosphere is, for all
the world, like that of a melodrama."</p>

<p>"You must have patience for a day or two," said the
plain-spoken officer. The Four Just Men were on the nerves of
more people than the Foreign Minister. "And we have not decided
what is to be our plan for this evening," he added.</p>

<p>"Do as you like," said Sir Philip shortly, and then: "Am I to
be allowed to go to the House tonight?"</p>

<p>"No; that is not part of the programme," replied the
detective.</p>

<p>Sir Philip stood for a moment in thought.</p>

<p>"These arrangements; they are kept secret, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"Who knows of them?"</p>

<p>"Yourself, the Commissioner, your secretary, and myself."</p>

<p>"And no one else?"</p>

<p>"No one; there is no danger likely to arise from that source.
If upon the secrecy of your movements your safety depended it
would be plain sailing."</p>

<p>"Have these arrangements been committed to writing?" asked Sir
Philip.</p>

<p>"No, sir; nothing has been written; our plans have been
settled upon and communicated verbally; even the Prime Minister
does not know."</p>

<p>Sir Philip breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"That is all to the good," he said, as the detective rose to
go.</p>

<p>"I must see the Commissioner. I shall be away for less than
half an hour; in the meantime I suggest that you do not leave
your room," he said.</p>

<p>Sir Philip followed him out to the ante-room, in which sat
Hamilton, the secretary.</p>

<p>"I have had an uncomfortable feeling," said Falmouth, as one
of his men approached with a long coat, which he proceeded to
help the detective into, "a sort of instinctive feeling this last
day or two, that I have been watched and followed, so that I am
using a car to convey me from place to place: they can't follow
that, without attracting some notice." He dipped his hand into
the pocket and brought out a pair of motoring goggles. He laughed
somewhat shamefacedly as he adjusted them. "This is the only
disguise I ever adopt, and I might say, Sir Philip," he added
with some regret, "that this is the first time during my
twenty-five years of service that I have ever played the fool
like a stage detective."</p>

<p>After Falmouth's departure the Foreign Minister returned to
his desk.</p>

<p>He hated being alone: it frightened him. That there were two
score detectives within call did not dispel the feeling of
loneliness. The terror of the Four was ever with him, and this
had so worked upon his nerves that the slightest noise irritated
him. He played with the penholder that lay on the desk. He
scribbled inconsequently on the blotting-pad before him, and was
annoyed to find that the scribbling had taken the form of numbers
of figure 4.</p>

<p>Was the Bill worth it? Was the sacrifice called for? Was the
measure of such importance as to justify the risk? These things
he asked himself again and again, and then immediately, What
sacrifice? What risk?</p>

<p>"I am taking the consequence too much for granted," he
muttered, throwing aside the pen, and half turning from the
writing-table. "There is no certainty that they will keep their
words; bah! it is impossible that they should&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Superintendent," said the Foreign Minister as the
knocker entered. "Back again already!"</p>

<p>The detective, vigorously brushing the dust from his moustache
with a handkerchief, drew an official-looking blue envelope from
his pocket.</p>

<p>"I thought I had better leave this in your care," he said,
dropping his voice; "it occurred to me just after I had left;
accidents happen, you know."</p>

<p>The Minister took the document.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It is something which would mean absolute disaster for me if
by chance it was found in my possession," said the detective,
turning to go.</p>

<p>"What am I to do with it?"</p>

<p>"You would greatly oblige me by putting it in your desk until
I return"; and the detective stepped into the anteroom, closed
the door behind him and, acknowledging the salute of the
plain-clothes officer who guarded the outer door, passed to the
motor-car that awaited him.</p>

<p>Sir Philip looked at the envelope with a puzzled frown.</p>

<p>It bore the superscription Confidential and the address,
Department A, CID, Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>'Some confidential report,' thought Sir Philip, and an angry
doubt as to the possibility of it containing particulars of the
police arrangements for his safety filled his mind. He had hit by
accident upon the truth had he but known. The envelope contained
those particulars.</p>

<p>He placed the letter in a drawer of his desk and drew some
papers towards him.</p>

<p>They were copies of the Bill for the passage of which he was
daring so much.</p>

<p>It was not a long document. The clauses were few in number,
the objects, briefly described in the preamble, were tersely
defined. There was no fear of this Bill failing to pass on the
morrow. The Government's majority was assured. Men had been
brought back to town, stragglers had been whipped in, prayers and
threats alike had assisted in concentrating the rapidly dwindling
strength of the administration on this one effort of legislation;
and what the frantic entreaties of the Whips had failed to
secure, curiosity had accomplished, for members of both parties
were hurrying to town to be present at a scene which might
perhaps be history, and, as many feared, tragedy.</p>

<p>As Sir Philip conned the paper he mechanically formed in his
mind the line of attack&mdash;for, tragedy or no, the Bill struck
at too many interests in the House to allow of its passage
without a stormy debate. He was a master of dialectics, a
brilliant casuist, a coiner of phrases that stuck and stung.
There was nothing for him to fear in the debate. If only&mdash;It
hurt him to think of the Four Just Men. Not so much because they
threatened his life&mdash;he had gone past that&mdash;but the
mere thought that there had come a new factor into his
calculations, a new and terrifying force, that could not be
argued down or brushed aside with an acid jest, nor intrigued
against, nor adjusted by any parliamentary method. He did not
think of compromise. The possibility of making terms with his
enemy never once entered his head.</p>

<p>"I'll go through with it!" he cried, not once but a score of
times; "I'll go through with it!" and now, as the moment grew
nearer to hand, his determination to try conclusions with this
new world-force grew stronger than ever.</p>

<p>The telephone at his elbow purred&mdash;he was sitting at his
desk with his head on his hands&mdash;and he took the receiver.
The voice of his house steward reminded him that he had arranged
to give instructions for the closing of the house in Portland
Place.</p>

<p>For two or three days, or until this terror had subsided, he
intended his house should be empty. He would not risk the lives
of his servants. If the Four intended to carry out their plan
they would run no risks of failure, and if the method they
employed were a bomb, then, to make assurance doubly sure, an
explosion at Downing Street might well synchronize with an
outrage at Portland Place.</p>

<p>He had finished his talk, and was replacing the receiver when
a knock at the door heralded the entry of the detective.</p>

<p>He looked anxiously at the Minister.</p>

<p>"Nobody been, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>Sir Philip smiled.</p>

<p>"If by that you mean have the Four delivered their ultimatum
in person, I can comfort your mind&mdash;they have not."</p>

<p>The detective's face was evidence of his relief.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!" he said fervently. "I had an awful dread that
whilst I was away something would happen. But I have news for
you, sir."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, the Commissioner has received a long cable from
America. Since the two murders in that country one of Pinkerton's
men has been engaged in collecting data. For years he has been
piecing together the scrappy evidence he has been able to secure,
and this is his cable-gram." The detective drew a paper from his
pocket and, spreading it on the desk, read:</p>

<p>Pinkerton, Chicago, to Commissioner of Police, Scotland yard,
London.</p>

<p>Warn Ramon that the Four do not go outside their promise. If
they have threatened to kill in a certain manner at a certain
time they will be punctual. We have proof of this characteristic.
After Anderson's death small memorandum book was discovered
outside window of room evidently dropped. Book was empty save for
three pages, which were filled with neatly written memoranda
headed 'Six methods of execution'. It was initialled 'C.' (third
letter in alphabet). Warn Ramon against following: drinking
coffee in any form, opening letters or parcels, using soap that
has not been manufactured under eye of trustworthy agent, sitting
in any room other than that occupied day and night by police
officer. Examine his bedroom; see if there is any method by which
heavy gases can be introduced. We are sending two men by
'Lucania' to watch.</p>

<p>The detective finished reading. 'Watch' was not the last word
in the original message, as he knew. There had been an ominous
postscript, Afraid they will arrive too late.</p>

<p>"Then you think&mdash;?" asked the statesman.</p>

<p>"That your danger lies in doing one of the things that
Pinkerton warns us against," replied the detective. "There is no
fear that the American police are talking idly. They have based
their warning on some sure knowledge, and that is why I regard
their cable as important."</p>

<p>There was a sharp rap on the panel of the door, and without
waiting for invitation the private secretary walked into the
room, excitedly waving a newspaper.</p>

<p>"Look at this!" he cried, "read this! The Four have admitted
their failure."</p>

<p>"What!" shouted the detective, reaching for the journal.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" asked Sir Philip sharply.</p>

<p>"Only this, sir: these beggars, it appears, have actually
written an article on their 'mission'."</p>

<p>"In what newspaper?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Megaphone</i>. It seems when they recaptured Thery the
editor asked the masked man to write him an article about
himself, and they've done it; and it's here, and they've admitted
defeat, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The detective had seized the paper and broke in upon the
incoherent secretary's speech.</p>

<p>"The Creed of the Four Just Men" he read. "Where is their
confession of failure?"</p>

<p>"Half way down the column&mdash;I have marked the
passage&mdash;here"; and the young man pointed with a trembling
finger to a paragraph.</p>

<p>"'We leave nothing to chance,'" read the detective, "'if the
slightest hitch occurs, if the least detail of our plan
miscarries, we acknowledge defeat. So assured are we that our
presence on earth is necessary for the carrying out of a great
plan, so certain are we that we are the indispensable instruments
of a divine providence, that we dare not, for the sake of our
very cause, accept unnecessary risks. It is essential therefore
that the various preliminaries to every execution should be
carried out to the full. As an example, it will be necessary for
us to deliver our final warning to Sir Philip Ramon; and to add
point to this warning, it is, by our code, essential that that
should be handed to the Minister by one of us in person. All
arrangements have been made to carry this portion of our
programme into effect. But such are the extraordinary exigencies
of our system that unless this warning can be handed to Sir
Philip in accordance with our promise, and before eight o'clock
this evening, our arrangements fall to the ground, and the
execution we have planned must be forgone.'"</p>

<p>The detective stopped reading, with disappointment visible on
every line of his face.</p>

<p>"I thought, sir, by the way you were carrying on that you had
discovered something new. I've read all this, a copy of the
article was sent to the Yard as soon as it was received."</p>

<p>The secretary thumped the desk impatiently.</p>

<p>"But don't you see!" he cried, "don't you understand that
there is no longer any need to guard Sir Philip, that there is no
reason to use him as a bait, or, in fact, to do anything if we
are to believe these men&mdash;look at the time&mdash;"</p>

<p>The detective's hand flew to his pocket; he drew out his
watch, looked at the dial, and whistled.</p>

<p>"Half past eight, by God!" he muttered in astonishment, and
the three stood in surprised silence.</p>

<p>Sir Philip broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Is it a ruse to take us off our guard?" he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," replied the detective slowly, "I feel sure
that it is not; nor shall I relax my watch&mdash;but I am a
believer in the honesty of these men&mdash;I don't know why I
should say this, for I have been dealing with criminals for the
past twenty-five years, and never once have I put an ounce of
faith in the word of the best of 'em, but somehow I can't
disbelieve these men. If they have failed to deliver their
message they will not trouble us again."</p>

<p>Ramon paced his room with quick, nervous steps.</p>

<p>"I wish I could believe that," he muttered; "I wish I had your
faith."</p>

<p>A tap on the door panel.</p>

<p>"An urgent telegram for Sir Philip," said a grey-haired
attendant.</p>

<p>The Minister stretched out his hand, but the detective was
before him.</p>

<p>"Remember Pinkerton's wire, sir," he said, and ripped open the
brown envelope.</p>

<p>Just received a telegram handed in at Charing Cross 7.52.
Begins: We have delivered our last message to the foreign
Secretary, signed Four. Ends. Is this true? Editor,
<i>Megaphone</i>.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" asked Falmouth in bewilderment when he
had finished reading.</p>

<p>"It means, my dear Mr. Falmouth," replied Sir Philip testily,
"that your noble Four are liars and braggarts as well as
murderers; and it means at the same time, I hope, an end to your
ridiculous faith in their honesty."</p>

<p>The detective made no answer, but his face was clouded and he
bit his lips in perplexity.</p>

<p>"Nobody came after I left?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nobody."</p>

<p>"You have seen no person besides your secretary and
myself?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely nobody has spoken to me, or approached within a
dozen yards of me," Ramon answered shortly.</p>

<p>Falmouth shook his head despairingly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I&mdash;where are we?" he asked, speaking more to
himself than to anybody in the room, and moved towards the
door.</p>

<p>Then it was that Sir Philip remembered the package left in his
charge.</p>

<p>"You had better take your precious documents," he said,
opening his drawer and throwing the package left in his charge on
to the table.</p>

<p>The detective looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"What is this?" he asked, picking up the envelope.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the shock of finding yourself deceived in your
estimate of my persecutors has dazed you," said Sir Philip, and
added pointedly, "I must ask the Commissioner to send an officer
who has a better appreciation of the criminal mind, and a less
childlike faith in the honour of murderers."</p>

<p>"As to that, sir," said Falmouth, unmoved by the outburst,
"you must do as you think best. I have discharged my duty to my
own satisfaction; and I have no more critical taskmaster than
myself. But what I am more anxious to hear is exactly what you
mean by saying that I handed any papers into your care."</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary glared across the table at the
imperturbable police officer.</p>

<p>"I am referring, sir," he said harshly, "to the packet which
you returned to leave in my charge."</p>

<p>The detective stared.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;did&mdash;not&mdash;return," he said in a strained
voice. "I have left no papers in your hands." He picked up the
package from the table, tore it open, and disclosed yet another
envelope. As he caught sight of the grey-green cover he gave a
sharp cry.</p>

<p>"This is the message of the Four," said Falmouth.</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary staggered back a pace, white to the
lips.</p>

<p>"And the man who delivered it?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Was one of the Four Just Men," said the detective grimly.
"They have kept their promise."</p>

<p>He took a quick step to the door, passed through into the
ante-room and beckoned the plain-clothes officer who stood on
guard at the outer door.</p>

<p>"Do you remember my going out?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;both times."</p>

<p>"Both times, eh!" said Falmouth bitterly, "and how did I look
the second time?"</p>

<p>His subordinate was bewildered at the form the question
took.</p>

<p>"As usual, sir," he stammered.</p>

<p>"How was I dressed?"</p>

<p>The constable considered.</p>

<p>"In your long dust-coat."</p>

<p>"I wore my goggles, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I thought so," muttered Falmouth savagely, and raced down the
broad marble stairs that led to the entrance-hall. There were
four men on duty who saluted him as he approached.</p>

<p>"Do you remember my going out?" he asked of the sergeant in
charge.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;both times," the officer replied.</p>

<p>"Damn your 'both times'!" snapped Falmouth; "how long had I
been gone the first time before I returned?"</p>

<p>"Five minutes, sir," was the astonished officer's reply.</p>

<p>"They just gave themselves time to do it," muttered Falmouth,
and then aloud, "Did I return in my car?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah!"&mdash;hope sprang into the detective's breast&mdash;"did
you notice the number?" he asked, almost fearful to hear the
reply.</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>The detective could have hugged the stolid officer.</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;what was it?"</p>

<p>"A17164."</p>

<p>The detective made a rapid note of the number.</p>

<p>"Jackson," he called, and one of the men in mufti stepped
forward and saluted.</p>

<p>"Go to the Yard; find out the registered owner of this car.
When you have found this go to the owner; ask him to explain his
movements; if necessary, take him into custody."</p>

<p>Falmouth retraced his steps to Sir Philip's study. He found
the statesman still agitatedly walking up and down the room, the
secretary nervously drumming his fingers on the table, and the
letter still unopened.</p>

<p>"As I thought," explained Falmouth, "the man you saw was one
of the Four impersonating me. He chose his time admirably: my own
men were deceived. They managed to get a car exactly similar in
build and colour to mine, and, watching their opportunity, they
drove to Downing Street a few minutes after I had left. There is
one last chance of our catching him&mdash;luckily the sergeant on
duty noticed the number of the car, and we might be able to trace
him through that&mdash;hullo." An attendant stood at the
door.</p>

<p>Would the Superintendent see Detective Jackson?</p>

<p>Falmouth found him waiting in the hall below.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir," said Jackson, saluting, "but is
there not some mistake in this number?"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the detective sharply.</p>

<p>"Because," said the man, "A17164 is the number of your own
car."</p> <hr>

<p class="first">FINAL warning was brief and to the point:</p>

<p>We allow you until tomorrow evening to reconsider your
position in the matter of the Aliens Extradition Bill. If by six
o'clock no announcement is made in the afternoon newspapers of
your withdrawing this measure we shall have no other course to
pursue but to fulfil our promise. You will die at eight in the
evening. We append for your enlightenment a concise table of the
secret police arrangements made for your safety tomorrow.
Farewell.</p>

<p>(Signed) four just men</p>

<p>Sir Philip read this over without a tremor. He read too the
slip of paper on which was written, in the strange foreign hand,
the details that the police had not dared to put into
writing.</p>

<p>"There is a leakage somewhere," he said, and the two anxious
watchers saw that the face of their charge was grey and
drawn.</p>

<p>"These details were known only to four," said the detective
quietly, "and I'll stake my life that it was neither the
Commissioner nor myself."</p>

<p>"Nor I!" said the private secretary emphatically.</p>

<p>Sir Philip shrugged his shoulders with a weary laugh.</p>

<p>"What does it matter?&mdash;they know," he exclaimed; "by what
uncanny method they learnt the secret I neither know nor care.
The question is, can I be adequately protected tomorrow night at
eight o'clock?"</p>

<p>Falmouth shut his teeth.</p>

<p>"Either you'll come out of it alive or, by the Lord, they'll
kill two," he said, and there was a gleam in his eye that spoke
for his determination.</p>

<p>The news that yet another letter had reached the great
statesman was on the streets at ten o'clock that night. It
circulated through the clubs and theatres, and between the acts
grave-faced men stood in the vestibules discussing Ramon's
danger. The House of Commons was seething with excitement. In the
hope that the Minister would come down, a strong House had
gathered, but the members were disappointed, for it was evident
soon after the dinner recess that Sir Philip had no intention of
showing himself that night.</p>

<p>"Might I ask the right honourable the Prime Minister whether
it is the intention of His Majesty's Government to proceed with
the Aliens Extradition (Political Offences) Bill," asked the
Radical Member for West Deptford, "and whether he has not
considered, in view of the extraordinary conditions that this
Bill has called into life, the advisability of postponing the
introduction of this measure?"</p>

<p>The question was greeted with a chorus of 'hear-hears', and
the Prime Minister rose slowly and turned an amused glance in the
direction of the questioner.</p>

<p>"I know of no circumstance that is likely to prevent my right
honourable friend, who is unfortunately not in his place tonight,
from moving the second reading of the Bill tomorrow," he said,
and sat down.</p>

<p>"What the devil was he grinning at?" grumbled West Deptford to
a neighbour.</p>

<p>"He's deuced uncomfortable, is JK," said the other wisely,
"deuced uncomfortable; a man in the Cabinet was telling me today
that old JK has been feeling deuced uncomfortable. 'You mark my
words,' he said, 'this Four Just Men business is making the
Premier deuced uncomfortable,'" and the hon. member subsided to
allow West Deptford to digest his neighbour's profundities.</p>

<p>"I've done my best to persuade Ramon to drop the Bill," the
Premier was saying, "but he is adamant, and the pitiable thing is
that he believes in his heart of hearts that these fellows intend
keeping faith."</p>

<p>"It is monstrous," said the Colonial Secretary hotly; "it is
inconceivable that such a state of affairs can last. Why, it
strikes at the root of everything, it unbalances every adjustment
of civilisation."</p>

<p>"It is a poetical idea," said the phlegmatic Premier, "and the
standpoint of the Four is quite a logical one. Think of the
enormous power for good or evil often vested in one man: a
capitalist controlling the markets of the world, a speculator
cornering cotton or wheat whilst mills stand idle and people
starve, tyrants and despots with the destinies of nations between
their thumb and finger&mdash;and then think of the four men,
known to none; vague, shadowy figures stalking tragically through
the world, condemning and executing the capitalist, the corner
maker, the tyrant&mdash;evil forces all, and all beyond reach of
the law. We have said of these people, such of us as are touched
with mysticism, that God would judge them. Here are men
arrogating to themselves the divine right of superior judgment.
If we catch them they will end their lives unpicturesquely, in a
matter-of-fact, commonplace manner in a little shed in
Pentonville Gaol, and the world will never realise how great are
the artists who perish."</p>

<p>"But Ramón?"</p>

<p>The Premier smiled.</p>

<p>"Here, I think, these men have just overreached themselves.
Had they been content to slay first and explain their mission
afterwards I have little doubt that Ramon would have died. But
they have warned and warned and exposed their hand a dozen times
over. I know nothing of the arrangements that are being made by
the police, but I should imagine that by tomorrow night it will
be as difficult to get within a dozen yards of Ramon as it would
be for a Siberian prisoner to dine with the Czar."</p>

<p>"Is there no possibility of Ramon withdrawing the Bill?" asked
the Colonies.</p>

<p>The Premier shook his head.</p>

<p>"Absolutely none," he said.</p>

<p>The rising of a member of the Opposition front bench at that
moment to move an amendment to a clause under discussion cut
short the conversation.</p>

<p>The House rapidly emptied when it became generally known that
Ramon did not intend appearing, and the members gathered in the
smoking-room and lobby to speculate upon the matter which was
uppermost in their minds.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of Palace Yard a great crowd had gathered, as
in London crowds will gather, on the off-chance of catching a
glimpse of the man whose name was in every mouth. Street vendors
sold his portrait, frowsy men purveying the real life and
adventures of the Four Just Men did a roaring trade, and
itinerant street singers, introducing extemporised verses into
their repertoire, declaimed the courage of that statesman bold,
who dared for to resist the threats of coward alien and deadly
anarchist.</p>

<p>There was praise in these poor lyrics for Sir Philip, who was
trying to prevent the foreigner from taking the bread out of the
mouths of honest working men.</p>

<p>The humour of which appealed greatly to Manfred, who, with
Poiccart, had driven to the Westminster end of the Embankment;
having dismissed their cab, they were walking to Whitehall.</p>

<p>"I think the verse about the 'deadly foreign anarchist' taking
the bread out of the mouth of the home-made variety is distinctly
good," chuckled Manfred.</p>

<p>Both men were in evening dress, and Poiccart wore in his
button-hole the silken button of a Chevalier of the Legion
d'Honneur.</p>

<p>Manfred continued:</p>

<p>"I doubt whether London has had such a sensation
since&mdash;when?"</p>

<p>Poiccart's grim smile caught the other's eye and he smiled in
sympathy.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I asked the same question of the maitre d'hotel," he said
slowly, like a man loath to share a joke; "he compared the
agitation to the atrocious East-End murders."</p>

<p>Manfred stopped dead and looked with horror on his
companion.</p>

<p>"Great heavens!" he exclaimed in distress, "it never occurred
to me that we should be compared with&mdash;him!"</p>

<p>They resumed their walk.</p>

<p>"It is part of the eternal bathos," said Poiccart serenely;
"even De Quincey taught the English nothing. The God of Justice
has but one interpreter here, and he lives in a public-house in
Lancashire, and is an expert and dexterous disciple of the
lamented Marwood, whose system he has improved upon."</p>

<p>They were traversing that portion of Whitehall from which
Scotland Yard runs.</p>

<p>A man, slouching along with bent head and his hands thrust
deep into the pockets of his tattered coat, gave them a swift
sidelong glance, stopped when they had passed, and looked after
them. Then he turned and quickened his shuffle on their trail. A
press of people and a seeming ceaseless string of traffic at the
corner of Cockspur Street brought Manfred and Poiccart to a
standstill, waiting for an opportunity to cross the road. They
were subjected to a little jostling as the knot of waiting people
thickened, but eventually they crossed and walked towards St
Martin's Lane.</p>

<p>The comparison which Poiccart had quoted still rankled with
Manfred.</p>

<p>"There will be people at His Majesty's tonight," he said,
"applauding Brutus as he asks, 'What villain touched his body and
not for justice?' You will not find a serious student of history,
or any commonplace man of intelligence, for the matter of that,
who, if you asked, Would it not have been God's blessing for the
world if Bonaparte had been assassinated on his return from
Egypt? would not answer without hesitation, Yes. But we&mdash;we
are murderers!"</p>

<p>"They would not have erected a statue of Napoleon's assassin,"
said Poiccart easily, "any more than they have enshrined Felton,
who slew a profligate and debauched Minister of Charles I.
Posterity may do us justice," he spoke half mockingly; "for
myself I am satisfied with the approval of my conscience."</p>

<p>He threw away the cigar he was smoking, and put his hand to
the inside pocket of his coat to find another. He withdrew his
hand without the cigar and whistled a passing cab.</p>

<p>Manfred looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>"What is the matter? I thought you said you would walk?"</p>

<p>Nevertheless he entered the hansom and Poiccart followed,
giving his direction through the trap, "Baker Street
Station."</p>

<p>The cab was rattling through Shaftesbury Avenue before
Poiccart gave an explanation.</p>

<p>"I have been robbed," he said, sinking his voice, "my watch
has gone, but that does not matter; the pocketbook with the notes
I made for the guidance of Thery has gone&mdash;and that matters
a great deal."</p>

<p>"It may have been a common thief," said Manfred: "he took the
watch."</p>

<p>Poiccart was feeling his pockets rapidly.</p>

<p>"Nothing else has gone," he said; "it may have been as you
say, a pickpocket, who will be content with the watch and will
drop the notebook down the nearest drain; but it may be a police
agent."</p>

<p>"Was there anything in it to identify you?" asked Manfred, in
a troubled tone.</p>

<p>"Nothing," was the prompt reply; "but unless the police are
blind they would understand the calculations and the plans. It
may not come to their hands at all, but if it does and the thief
can recognise us we are in a fix."</p>

<p>The cab drew up at the down station at Baker Street, and the
two men alighted.</p>

<p>"I shall go east," said Poiccart, "we will meet in the
morning. By that time I shall have learnt whether the book has
reached Scotland Yard. Goodnight."</p>

<p>And with no other farewell than this the two men parted.</p>

<p>If Billy Marks had not had a drop of drink he would have been
perfectly satisfied with his night's work. Filled, however, with
that false liquid confidence that leads so many good men astray,
Billy thought it would be a sin to neglect the opportunities that
the gods had shown him. The excitement engendered by the threats
of the Four Just Men had brought all suburban London to
Westminster, and on the Surrey side of the bridge Billy found
hundreds of patient suburbanites waiting for conveyance to
Streatham, Camberwell, Clapham, and Greenwich.</p>

<p>So, the night being comparatively young, Billy decided to work
the trams.</p>

<p>He touched a purse from a stout old lady in black, a Waterbury
watch from a gentleman in a top hat, a small hand mirror from a
dainty bag, and decided to conclude his operations with the
exploration of a superior young lady's pocket.</p>

<p>Billy's search was successful. A purse and a lace handkerchief
rewarded him, and he made arrangements for a modest retirement.
Then it was that a gentle voice breathed into his ear. "Hullo,
Billy!"</p>

<p>He knew the voice, and felt momentarily unwell.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Mister Howard," he exclaimed with feigned joy; "'ow
are you, sir? Fancy meetin' you!"</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Billy?" asked the welcome Mr. Howard,
taking Billy's arm affectionately.</p>

<p>"'Ome," said the virtuous Billy.</p>

<p>"Home it is," said Mr. Howard, leading the unwilling Billy
from the crowd; "home, sweet home, it is, Billy." He called
another young man, with whom he seemed to be acquainted: "Go on
that car, Porter, and see who has lost anything. If you can find
anyone bring them along"; and the other young man obeyed.</p>

<p>"And now," said Mr. Howard, still holding Billy's arm
affectionately, "tell me how the world has been using you."</p>

<p>"Look 'ere, Mr. Howard," said Billy earnestly, "what's the
game? where are you takin' me?"</p>

<p>"The game is the old game," said Mr. Howard sadly&mdash;"the
same old game, Bill, and I'm taking you to the same old sweet
spot."</p>

<p>"You've made a mistake this time, guv'nor," cried Bill
fiercely, and there was a slight clink.</p>

<p>"Permit me, Billy," said Mr. Howard, stooping quickly and
picking up the purse Billy had dropped.</p>

<p>At the police station the sergeant behind the charge desk
pretended to be greatly overjoyed at Billy's arrival, and the
gaoler, who put Billy into a steel-barred dock, and passed his
hands through cunning pockets, greeted him as a friend.</p>

<p>"Gold watch, half a chain, gold, three purses, two
handkerchiefs, and a red moroccer pocketbook," reported the
gaoler.</p>

<p>The sergeant nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>"Quite a good day's work, William," he said.</p>

<p>"What shall I get this time?" inquired the prisoner, and Mr.
Howard, a plain-clothes officer engaged in filling in particulars
of the charge, opined nine moons.</p>

<p>"Go on!" exclaimed Mr. Billy Marks in consternation.</p>

<p>"Fact," said the sergeant; "you're a rogue and a vagabond,
Billy, you're a petty larcenist, and you're for the sessions this
time&mdash;Number Eight."</p>

<p>This latter was addressed to the gaoler, who bore Billy off to
the cells protesting vigorously against a police force that could
only tumble to poor blokes, and couldn't get a touch on
sanguinary murderers like the Four Just Men.</p>

<p>"What do we pay rates and taxes for?" indignantly demanded
Billy through the grating of his cell.</p>

<p>"Fat lot you'll ever pay, Billy," said the gaoler, putting the
double lock on the door.</p>

<p>In the charge office Mr. Howard and the sergeant were
examining the stolen property, and three owners, discovered by PC
Porter, were laying claim to their own.</p>

<p>"That disposes of all the articles except the gold watch and
the pocketbook," said the sergeant after the claimants had gone,
"gold watch, Elgin half-hunter N05029020, pocketbook containing
no papers, no card, no address, and only three pages of writing.
What this means I don't know." The sergeant handed the book to
Howard. The page that puzzled the policeman contained simply a
list of streets. Against each street was scrawled a cabalistic
character.</p>

<p>"Looks like the diary of a paperchase," said Mr. Howard. "What
is on the other pages?" They turned the leaf. This was filled
with figures.</p>

<p>"H'm," said the disappointed sergeant, and again turned
overleaf. The contents of this page was understandable and
readable although evidently written in a hurry as though it had
been taken down at dictation.</p>

<p>"The chap who wrote this must have had a train to catch," said
the facetious Mr. Howard, pointing to the abbreviations:</p>

<p>Will not leave D.S., except for Hs. Will drive to Hs in M.C.
(4 dummy brghms first), 8.30. At 2 600 p arve traf divtd Embank,
80 spls. inside D.S. One each rm, three each cor, six basmt, six

carry revr. Nobody except F and H to approach R. In Hse strange
gal filled with spl, all press vouched for. 200 spl. in cor. If
nee battalion guards at disposal.</p>

<p>The policeman read this over slowly.</p>

<p>"Now what the devil does that mean?" asked the sergeant
helplessly.</p>

<p>It was at that precise moment that Constable Howard earned his
promotion.</p>

<p>"Let me have that book for ten minutes," he said excitedly.
The sergeant handed the book over with wondering stare.</p>

<p>"I think I can find an owner for this," said Howard, his hand
trembling as he took the book, and ramming his hat on his head he
ran out into the street.</p>

<p>He did not stop running until he reached the main road, and
finding a cab he sprang in with a hurried order to the
driver.</p>

<p>"Whitehall, and drive like blazes," he called, and in a few
minutes he was explaining his errand to the inspector in charge
of the cordon that guarded the entrance of Downing Street.</p>

<p>"Constable Howard, 946 L. reserve," he introduced himself.
"I've a very important message for Superintendent Falmouth."</p>

<p>That officer, looking tired and beaten, listened to the
policeman's story.</p>

<p>"It looks to me," went on Howard breathlessly, "as though this
has something to do with your case, sir. D.S. is Downing Street,
and&mdash;" He produced the book and Falmouth snatched at it.</p>

<p>He read a few words and then gave a triumphant cry.</p>

<p>"Our secret instructions," he cried, and catching the
constable by the arm he drew him to the entrance hall.</p>

<p>"Is my car outside?" he asked, and in response to a whistle a
car drew up. "Jump in, Howard," said the detective, and the car
slipped into Whitehall.</p>

<p>"Who is the thief?" asked the senior.</p>

<p>"Billy Marks, sir," replied Howard; "you may not know him, but
down at Lambeth he is a well-known character."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Falmouth hastened to correct, "I know Billy very
well indeed&mdash;we'll see what he has to say."</p>

<p>The car drew up at the police station and the two men jumped
out.</p>

<p>The sergeant rose to his feet as he recognised the famous
Falmouth, and saluted.</p>

<p>"I want to see the prisoner Marks," said Falmouth shortly, and
Billy, roused from his sleep, came blinking into the charge
office.</p>

<p>"Now, Billy," said the detective, "I've got a few words to say
to you."</p>

<p>"Why, it's Mr. Falmouth," said the astonished Billy, and
something like fear shaded his face. "I wasn't in that 'Oxton
affair, s'help me."</p>

<p>"Make your mind easy, Billy; I don't want you for anything,
and if you'll answer my questions truthfully, you may get off the
present charge and get a reward into the bargain."</p>

<p>Billy was suspicious.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to give anybody away if that's what you mean,"
he said sullenly.</p>

<p>"Nor that either," said the detective impatiently. "I want to
know where you found this pocketbook," and he held it up.</p>

<p>Billy grinned.</p>

<p>"Found it lyin' on the pavement," he lied.</p>

<p>"I want the truth," thundered Falmouth.</p>

<p>"Well," said Billy sulkily, "I pinched it."</p>

<p>"From whom?"</p>

<p>"I didn't stop to ask him his name," was the impudent
reply.</p>

<p>The detective breathed deeply.</p>

<p>"Now, look here," he said, lowering his voice, "you've heard
about the Four Just Men?"</p>

<p>Billy nodded, opening his eyes in amazement at the
question.</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed Falmouth impressively, "the man to whom this
pocketbook belongs is one of them."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Billy.</p>

<p>"For his capture there is a reward of a thousand pounds
offered. If your description leads to his arrest that thousand is
yours."</p>

<p>Marks stood paralysed at the thought.</p>

<p>"A thousand&mdash;a thousand?" he muttered in a dazed fashion,
"and I might just as easily have caught him."</p>

<p>"Come, come!" cried the detective sharply, "you may catch him
yet&mdash;tell us what he looked like."</p>

<p>Billy knitted his brows in thought.</p>

<p>"He looked like a gentleman," he said, trying to recall from
the chaos of his mind a picture of his victim; "he had a white
weskit, a white shirt, nice patent shoes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But his face&mdash;his face!" demanded the detective.</p>

<p>"His face?" cried Billy indignantly, "how do I know what it
looked like? I don't look a chap in the face when I'm pinching
his watch, do I?"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap09" id="chap09">IX. &mdash; THE CUPIDITY OF
MARKS</a></h2>

<p class="first">"YOU cursed dolt, you infernal fool!" stormed
the detective, catching Billy by the collar and shaking him like
a rat. "Do you mean to tell me that you had one of the Four Just
Men in your hand, and did not even take the trouble to look at
him?"</p>

<p>Billy wrenched himself free.</p>

<p>"You leave me alone!" he said defiantly. "How was I to know it
was one of the Four Just Men, and how do you know it was?" he
added with a cunning twist of his face. Billy's mind was
beginning to work rapidly. He saw in this staggering statement of
the detective a chance of making capital out of the position
which to within a few minutes he had regarded as singularly
unfortunate.</p>

<p>"I did get a bit of a glance at 'em," he said,
"they&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Them&mdash;they?" said the detective quickly. "How many were
there?"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Billy sulkily. He felt the strength of his
position.</p>

<p>"Billy," said the detective earnestly, "I mean business; if
you know anything you've got to tell us!'</p>

<p>"Ho!" cried the prisoner in defiance. "Got to, 'ave I? Well, I
know the lor as well as you&mdash;you can't make a chap speak if
he don't want. You can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>The detective signalled the other police officers to retire,
and when they were out of earshot he dropped his voice and
said:</p>

<p>"Harry Moss came out last week."</p>

<p>Billy flushed and lowered his eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know no Harry Moss," he muttered doggedly.</p>

<p>"Harry Moss came out last week," continued the detective
shortly, "after doing three years for robbery with
violence&mdash;three years and ten lashes."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about it," said Marks in the same
tone.</p>

<p>"He got clean away and the police had no clues," the detective
went on remorselessly, "and they might not have caught him to
this day, only&mdash;only 'from information received' they took
him one night out of his bed in Leman Street."</p>

<p>Billy licked his dry lips, but did not speak.</p>

<p>"Harry Moss would like to know who he owes his three stretch
to&mdash;and the ten. Men who've had the cat have a long memory,
Billy."</p>

<p>"That's not playing the game, Mr. Falmouth," cried Billy
thickly. "I&mdash;I was a bit hard up, an' Harry Moss wasn't a
pal of mine&mdash;and the p'lice wanted to find out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the police want to find out now," said Falmouth.</p>

<p>Billy Marks made no reply for a moment.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you all there is to be told," he said at last, and
cleared his throat. The detective stopped him.</p>

<p>"Not here," he said. Then turning to the officer in
charge:</p>

<p>"Sergeant, you may release this man on bail&mdash;I will stand
sponsor." The humorous side of this appealed to Billy at least,
for he grinned sheepishly and recovered his former spirits.</p>

<p>"First time I've been bailed out by the p'lice," he remarked
facetiously.</p>

<p>The motor-car bore the detective and his charge to Scotland
Yard, and in Superintendent Falmouth's office Billy prepared to
unburden himself.</p>

<p>"Before you begin," said the officer, "I want to warn you that
you must be as brief as possible. Every minute is precious."</p>

<p>So Billy told his story. In spite of the warning there were
embellishments, to which the detective was forced to listen
impatiently.</p>

<p>At last the pickpocket reached the point.</p>

<p>"There was two of 'em, one a tall chap and one not so tall. I
heard one say 'My dear George'&mdash;the little one said that,
the one I took the ticker from and the pocketbook. Was there
anything in the notebook?" Billy asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"Go on," said the detective.</p>

<p>"Well," resumed Billy, "I follered 'em up to the end of the
street, and they was waitin' to cross towards Charing Cross Road
when I lifted the clock, you understand?"</p>

<p>"What time was this?"</p>

<p>"'Arf past ten&mdash;or it might've been eleven."</p>

<p>"And you did not see their faces?"</p>

<p>The thief shook his head emphatically.</p>

<p>"If I never get up from where I'm sittin' I didn't, Mr.
Falmouth," he said earnestly.</p>

<p>The detective rose with a sigh.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you're not much use to me, Billy," he said
ruefully. "Did you notice whether they wore beards, or were they
clean-shaven, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>Billy shook his head mournfully.</p>

<p>"I could easily tell you a lie, Mr. Falmouth," he said
frankly, "and I could easily pitch a tale that would take you in,
but I'm playin' it square with you."</p>

<p>The detective recognised the sincerity of the man and
nodded.</p>

<p>"You've done your best, Billy," he said, and then: "I'll tell
you what I'm going to do. You are the only man in the world who
has ever seen one of the Four Just Men&mdash;and lived to tell
the story. Now, although you cannot remember his face, perhaps if
you met him again in the street you would know him&mdash;there
may be some little trick of walking, some habit of holding the
hands that you cannot recall now, but if you saw again you would
recognise. I shall therefore take upon myself the responsibility
of releasing you from custody until the day after tomorrow. I
want you to find this man you robbed. Here is a sovereign; go
home, get a little sleep, turn out as early as you can and go
west." The detective went to his desk, and wrote a dozen words on
a card. "Take this: if you see the man or his companion, follow
them, show this card to the first policeman you meet, point out
the man, and you'll go to bed a thousand pounds richer than when
you woke."</p>

<p>Billy took the card.</p>

<p>"If you want me at any time you will find somebody here who
will know where I am. Goodnight," and Billy passed into the
street, his brain in a whirl, and a warrant written on a visiting
card in his waistcoat pocket.</p>

<p>The morning that was to witness great events broke bright and
clear over London. Manfred, who, contrary to his usual custom,
had spent the night at the workshop in Carnaby Street, watched
the dawn from the flat roof of the building.</p>

<p>He lay face downwards, a rug spread beneath him, his head
resting on his hands. Dawn with its white, pitiless light, showed
his strong face, seamed and haggard. The white streaks in his
trim beard were accentuated in the light of morning. He looked
tired and disheartened, so unlike his usual self that Gonsalez,
who crept up through the trap just before the sun rose, was as
near alarmed as it was possible for that phlegmatic man to be. He
touched him on the arm and Manfred started.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked Leon softly.</p>

<p>Manfred's smile and shake of head did not reassure the
questioner.</p>

<p>"Is it Poiccart and the thief?"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Manfred. Then speaking aloud, he asked: "Have
you ever felt over any of our cases as you feel in this?"</p>

<p>They spoke in such low tones as almost to approach whispering.
Gonsalez stared ahead thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes," he admitted, "once&mdash;the woman at Warsaw. You
remember how easy it all seemed, and how circumstance after
circumstance thwarted us... till I began to feel, as I feel now,
that we should fail."</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" said Manfred fiercely. "There must be no talk of
failure, Leon, no thought of it."</p>

<p>He crawled to the trapdoor and lowered himself into the
corridor, and Gonsalez followed.</p>

<p>"Thery?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Asleep."</p>

<p>They were entering the studio, and Manfred had his hand on the
door handle when a footstep sounded on the bottom floor.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" cried Manfred, and a soft whistle from below
sent him flying downstairs.</p>

<p>"Poiccart!" he cried.</p>

<p>Poiccart it was, unshaven, dusty, weary.</p>

<p>"Well?" Manfred's ejaculation was almost brutal in its
bluntness.</p>

<p>"Let us go upstairs," said Poiccart shortly. The three men
ascended the dusty stairway, not a word being spoken until they
had reached the small living-room.</p>

<p>Then Poiccart spoke:</p>

<p>"The very stars in their courses are fighting against us," he
said, throwing himself into the only comfortable chair in the
room, and flinging his hat into a corner. "The man who stole my
pocketbook has been arrested by the police. He is a well-known
criminal of a sneak-thief order, and unfortunately he had been
under observation during the evening. The pocketbook was found in
his possession, and all might have been well, but an unusually
smart police officer associated the contents with us.</p>

<p>"After I had left you I went home and changed, then made my
way to Downing Street. I was one of the curious crowd that stood
watching the guarded entrance. I knew that Falmouth was there,
and I knew, too, if there was any discovery made it would be
communicated immediately to Downing Street. Somehow I felt sure
the man was an ordinary thief, and that if we had anything to
fear it was from a chance arrest. Whilst I was waiting a cab
dashed up, and out an excited man jumped. He was obviously a
policeman, and I had just time to engage a hansom when Falmouth
and the new arrival came flying out. I followed them in the cab
as fast as possible without exciting the suspicion of the driver.
Of course, they outdistanced us, but their destination was
evident. I dismissed the cab at the corner of the street in which
the police station is situated, and walked down and found, as I
had expected, the car drawn up at the door.</p>

<p>"I managed to get a fleeting glance at the charge room&mdash;I
was afraid that any interrogation there might be would have been
conducted in the cell, but by the greatest of good luck they had
chosen the charge room. I saw Falmouth, and the policeman, and
the prisoner. The latter, a mean-faced, long-jawed man with
shifty eyes&mdash;no, no, Leon, don't question me about the
physiognomy of the man&mdash;my view was for photographic
purposes&mdash;I wanted to remember him.</p>

<p>"In that second I could see the detective's anger, the thief's
defiance, and I knew that the man was saying that he could not
recognise us."</p>

<p>"Ha!" It was Manfred's sigh of relief that put a period to
Poiccart's speech.</p>

<p>"But I wanted to make sure," resumed the latter. "I walked
back the way I had come. Suddenly I heard the hum of the car
behind me, and it passed me with another passenger. I guessed
that they were taking the man back to Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>"I was content to walk back; I was curious to know what the
police intended doing with their new recruit. Taking up a station
that gave me a view of the entrance of the street, I waited.
After a while the man came out alone. His step was light and
buoyant. A glimpse I got of his face showed me a strange blending
of bewilderment and gratification. He turned on to the
Embankment, and I followed close behind."</p>

<p>"There was a danger that he was being shadowed by the police,
too," said Gonsalez.</p>

<p>"Of that I was well satisfied," Poiccart rejoined. "I took a
very careful survey before I acted. Apparently the police were
content to let him roam free. When he was abreast of the Temple
steps he stopped and looked undecidedly left and right, as though
he were not quite certain as to what he should do next. At that
moment I came abreast of him, passed him, and then turned back,
fumbling in my pockets.</p>

<p>"'Can you oblige me with a match?'" I asked.</p>

<p>"He was most affable; produced a box of matches and invited me
to help myself.</p>

<p>"I took a match, struck it, and lit my cigar, holding the
match so that he could see my face."</p>

<p>"That was wise," said Manfred gravely.</p>

<p>"It showed his face too, and out of the corner of my eye I
watched him searching every feature. But there was no sign of
recognition and I began a conversation. We lingered where we had
met for a while and then by mutual consent we walked in the
direction of Blackfriars, crossed the bridge, chatting on
inconsequent subjects, the poor, the weather, the newspapers. On
the other side of the bridge is a coffee-stall. I determined to
make my next move. I invited him to take a cup of coffee, and
when the cups were placed before us, I put down a sovereign. The
stall-keeper shook his head, said he could not change it. 'Hasn't
your friend any small change?' he asked.</p>

<p>"It was here that the vanity of the little thief told me what
I wanted to know. He drew from his pocket, with a nonchalant
air&mdash;a sovereign. 'This is all that I have got,' he drawled.
I found some coppers&mdash;I had to think quickly. He had told
the police something, something worth paying for&mdash;what was
it? It could not have been a description of ourselves, for if he
had recognised us then, he would have known me when I struck the
match and when I stood there, as I did, in the full glare of the
light of the coffee- stall. And then a cold fear came to me.
Perhaps he had recognised me, and with a thief's cunning was
holding me in conversation until he could get assistance to take
me."</p>

<p>Poiccart paused for a moment, and drew a small phial from his
pocket; this he placed carefully on the table.</p>

<p>"He was as near to death then as ever he has been in his
life," he said quietly, "but somehow the suspicion wore away. In
our walk we had passed three policemen&mdash;there was an
opportunity if he had wanted it.</p>

<p>"He drank his coffee and said, 'I must be going home.'</p>

<p>"'Indeed!' I said. 'I suppose I really ought to go home
too&mdash;I have a lot of work to do tomorrow.' He leered at me.
'So have I,' he said with a grin, 'but whether I can do it or not
I don't know.'</p>

<p>"We had left the coffee-stall, and now stopped beneath a lamp
that stood at the corner of the street.</p>

<p>"I knew that I had only a few seconds to secure the
information I wanted&mdash;so I played bold and led directly to
the subject. 'What of these Four Just Men?' I asked, just as he
was about to slouch away. He turned back instantly. 'What about
them?' he asked quickly. I led him on from that by gentle stages
to the identity of the Four. He was eager to talk about them,
anxious to know what I thought, but most concerned of all about
the reward. He was engrossed in the subject, and then suddenly he
leant forward, and, tapping me on the chest, with a grimy
forefinger, he commenced to state a hypothetical case."</p>

<p>Poiccart stopped to laugh&mdash;his laugh ended in a sleepy
yawn.</p>

<p>"You know the sort of questions," said he, "and you know how
very naive the illiterate are when they are seeking to disguise
their identities by elaborate hypotheses. Well, that is the
story. He&mdash;Marks is his name&mdash;thinks he may be able to
recognise one of us by some extraordinary trick of memory. To
enable him to do this, he has been granted freedom&mdash;tomorrow
he would search London, he said."</p>

<p>"A full day's work," laughed Manfred.</p>

<p>"Indeed," agreed Poiccart soberly, "but hear the sequel. We
parted, and I walked westward perfectly satisfied of our
security. I made for Covent Garden Market, because this is one of
the places in London where a man may be seen at four o'clock in
the morning without exciting suspicion.</p>

<p>"I had strolled through the market, idly watching the busy
scene, when, for some cause that I cannot explain, I turned
suddenly on my heel and came face to face with Marks! He grinned
sheepishly, and recognised me with a nod of his head.</p>

<p>"He did not wait for me to ask him his business, but started
in to explain his presence.</p>

<p>"I accepted his explanation easily, and for the second time
that night invited him to coffee. He hesitated at first, then
accepted. When the coffee was brought, he pulled it to him as far
from my reach as possible, and then I knew that Mr. Marks had
placed me at fault, that I had underrated his intelligence, that
all the time he had been unburdening himself he had recognised
me. He had put me off my guard."</p>

<p>"But why&mdash;?" began Manfred.</p>

<p>"That is what I thought," the other answered. "Why did he not
have me arrested?" He turned to Leon, who had been a silent
listener. "Tell us, Leon, why?"</p>

<p>"The explanation is simple," said Gonsalez quietly: "why did
not Thery betray us?&mdash;cupidity, the second most potent force
of civilisation. He has some doubt of the reward. He may fear the
honesty of the police&mdash;most criminals do so; he may want
witnesses." Leon walked to the wall, where his coat hung. He
buttoned it thoughtfully, ran his hand over his smooth chin, then
pocketed the little phial that stood on the table.</p>

<p>"You have slipped him, I suppose?" he asked.</p>

<p>Poiccart nodded.</p>

<p>"He lives&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"At 700 Red Cross Street, in the Borough&mdash;it is a common
lodging-house."</p>

<p>Leon took a pencil from the table and rapidly sketched a head
upon the edge of a newspaper.</p>

<p>"Like this?" he asked.</p>

<p>Poiccart examined the portrait.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said in surprise; "have you seen him?"</p>

<p>"No," said Leon carelessly, "but such a man would have such a
head."</p>

<p>He paused on the threshold.</p>

<p>"I think it is necessary." There was a question in his
assertion. It was addressed rather to Manfred, who stood with his
folded arms and knit brow staring at the floor.</p>

<p>For answer Manfred extended his clenched fist. Leon saw the
down-turned thumb, and left the room.</p>

<p>Billy Marks was in a quandary. By the most innocent device in
the world his prey had managed to slip through his fingers. When
Poiccart, stopping at the polished doors of the best hotel in
London, whither they had strolled, casually remarked that he
would not be a moment and disappeared into the hotel, Billy was
nonplussed. This was a contingency for which he was not prepared.
He had followed the suspect from Blackfriars; he was almost sure
that this was the man he had robbed. He might, had he wished,
have called upon the first constable he met to take the man into
custody; but the suspicion of the thief, the fear that he might
be asked to share the reward with the man who assisted him
restrained him. And besides, it might not be the man at all,
argued Billy, and yet&mdash;</p>

<p>Poiccart was a chemist, a man who found joy in unhealthy
precipitates, who mixed evil-smelling drugs and distilled,
filtered, carbonated, oxydized, and did all manner of things in
glass tubes, to the vegetable, animal, and mineral products of
the earth.</p>

<p>Billy had left Scotland Yard to look for a man with a
discoloured hand. Here again, he might, had he been less fearful
of treachery, have placed in the hands of the police a very
valuable mark of identification.</p>

<p>It seems a very lame excuse to urge on Billy's behalf that
this cupidity alone stayed his hand when he came face to face
with the man he was searching for. And yet it was so. Then again
there was a sum in simple proportion to be worked out. If one
Just Man was worth a thousand pounds, what was the commercial
value of four? Billy was a thief with a business head. There were
no waste products in his day's labour. He was not a conservative
scoundrel who stuck to one branch of his profession. He would
pinch a watch, or snatch a till, or pass snide florins with equal
readiness. He was a butterfly of crime, flitting from one illicit
flower to another, and nor above figuring as the X of
'information received'.</p>

<p>So that when Poiccart disappeared within the magnificent
portals of the Royal Hotel in Northumberland Avenue, Billy was
hipped. He realised in a flash that his captive had gone whither
he could not follow without exposing his hand; that the chances
were he had gone for ever. He looked up and down the street;
there was no policeman in sight. In the vestibule, a porter in
shirt sleeves was polishing brasses. It was still very early; the
streets were deserted, and Billy, after a few moment's
hesitation, took a course that he would not have dared at a more
conventional hour.</p>

<p>He pushed open the swing doors and passed into the vestibule.
The porter turned on him as he entered and favoured him with a
suspicious frown.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asked he, eyeing the tattered coat of the
visitor in some disfavour.</p>

<p>"Look 'ere, old feller," began Billy, in his most conciliatory
tone.</p>

<p>Just then the porter's strong right arm caught him by the coat
collar, and Billy found himself stumbling into the street.</p>

<p>"Outside&mdash;you," said the porter firmly.</p>

<p>It needed this rebuff to engender in Marks the necessary
self-assurance to carry him through.</p>

<p>Straightening his ruffled clothing, he pulled Falmouth's card
from his pocket and returned to the charge with dignity.</p>

<p>"I am a p'lice officer," he said, adopting the opening that he
knew so well, "and if you interfere with me, look out, young
feller!"</p>

<p>The porter took the card and scrutinised it.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he asked in more civil tones. He would
have added 'sir', but somehow it stuck in his throat. If the man
is a detective, he argued to himself, he is very well
disguised.</p>

<p>"I want that gentleman that came in before me," said
Billy.</p>

<p>The porter scratched his head.</p>

<p>"What is the number of his room?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Never mind about the number of his room," said Billy rapidly.
"Is there any back way to this hotel&mdash;any way a man can get
out of it? I mean, besides through the front entrance?"</p>

<p>"Half a dozen," replied the porter.</p>

<p>Billy groaned.</p>

<p>"Take me round to one of them, will you?" he asked. And the
porter led the way.</p>

<p>One of the tradesmen's entrances was from a small back street;
and here it was that a street scavenger gave the information that
Marks had feared. Five minutes before a man answering to the
description had walked out, turned towards the Strand and,
picking up a cab in the sight of the street cleaner, had driven
off.</p>

<p>Baffled, and with the added bitterness that had he played
boldly he might have secured at any rate a share of a thousand
pounds, Billy walked slowly to the Embankment, cursing the folly
that had induced him to throw away the fortune that was in his
hands. With hands thrust deep into his pockets, he tramped the
weary length of the Embankment, going over again and again the
incidents of the night and each time muttering a lurid
condemnation of his error. It must have been an hour after he had
lost Poiccart that it occurred to him all was not lost. He had
the man's description, he had looked at his face, he knew him
feature by feature. That was something, at any rate. Nay, it
occurred to him that if the man was arrested through his
description he would still be entitled to the reward&mdash;or a
part of it. He dared not see Falmouth and tell him that he had
been in company with the man all night without effecting his
arrest. Falmouth would never believe him, and, indeed, it was
curious that he should have met him.</p>

<p>This fact struck Billy for the first time. By what strange
chance had he met this man? Was it possible&mdash;the idea
frightened Marks&mdash;that the man he had robbed had recognised
him, and that he had deliberately sought him out with murderous
intent?</p>

<p>A cold perspiration broke upon the narrow forehead of the
thief. These men were murderers, cruel, relentless murderers:
suppose&mdash;?</p>

<p>He turned from the contemplation of the unpleasant
possibilities to meet a man who was crossing the road towards
him. He eyed the stranger doubtingly. The newcomer was a
young-looking man, clean-shaven, with sharp features and restless
blue eyes. As he came closer, Marks noted that first appearance had
been deceptive; the man was not so young as he looked. He might
have been forty, thought Marks. He approached, looked hard at
Billy, then beckoned him to stop, for Billy was walking away.</p>

<p>"Is your name Marks?" asked the stranger authoritatively.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the thief.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Mr. Falmouth?"</p>

<p>"Not since last night," replied Marks in surprise.</p>

<p>"Then you are to come at once to him."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"At Kensington Police Station&mdash;there has been an arrest,
and he wants you to identify the man."</p>

<p>Billy's heart sank.</p>

<p>"Do I get any of the reward?" he demanded, "that is if I
recognise 'im?"</p>

<p>The other nodded and Billy's hopes rose.</p>

<p>"You must follow me," said the newcomer, "Mr. Falmouth does
not wish us to be seen together. Take a first-class ticket to
Kensington and get into the next carriage to
mine&mdash;come."</p>

<p>He turned and crossed the road toward Charing Cross, and Billy
followed at a distance.</p>

<p>He found the stranger pacing the platform and gave no sign of
recognition. A train pulled into the station and Marks followed
his conductor through a crowd of workmen the train had
discharged. He entered an empty first-class carriage, and Marks,
obeying instructions, took possession of the adjoining
compartment, and found himself the solitary occupant.</p>

<p>Between Charing Cross and Westminster Marks had time to review
his position. Between the last station and St James's Park, he
invented his excuses to the detective; between the Park and
Victoria he had completed his justification for a share of the
reward. Then as the train moved into the tunnel for its five
minutes' run to Sloane Square, Billy noticed a draught, and
turned his head to see the stranger standing on the footboard of
the swaying carriage, holding the half-opened door.</p>

<p>Marks was startled.</p>

<p>"Pull up the window on your side," ordered the man, and Billy,
hypnotised by the authoritative voice, obeyed. At that moment he
heard the tinkle of broken glass.</p>

<p>He turned with an angry snarl.</p>

<p>"What's the game?" he demanded.</p>

<p>For answer the stranger swung himself clear of the door and,
closing it softly, disappeared.</p>

<p>"What's his game?" repeated Marks drowsily. Looking down he
saw a broken phial at his feet, by the phial lay a shining
sovereign. He stared stupidly at it for a moment, then, just
before the train ran into Victoria Station, he stooped to pick it
up...</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10">X. &mdash; THREE WHO
DIED</a></h2>

<p class="first">A PASSENGER leisurely selecting his compartment
during the wait at Kensington opened a carriage door and
staggered back coughing. A solicitous porter and an alarmed
station official ran forward and pulled open the door, and the
sickly odour of almonds pervaded the station.</p>

<p>A little knot of passengers gathered and peered over one
another's shoulders, whilst the station inspector investigated.
By and by came a doctor, and a stretcher, and a policeman from
the street without.</p>

<p>Together they lifted the huddled form of a dead man from the
carriage and laid it on the platform.</p>

<p>"Did you find anything?" asked the policeman.</p>

<p>"A sovereign and a broken bottle," was the reply.</p>

<p>The policeman fumbled in the dead man's pockets.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose he'll have any papers to show who he is," he
said with knowledge. "Here's a first-class ticket&mdash;it must
be a case of suicide. Here's a card&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned it over and read it, and his face underwent a
change.</p>

<p>He gave a few hurried instructions, then made his way to the
nearest telegraph office.</p>

<p>Superintendent Falmouth, who had snatched a few hours' sleep
at the Downing Street house, rose with a troubled mind and an
uneasy feeling that in spite of all his precautions the day would
end disastrously. He was hardly dressed before the arrival of the
Assistant Commissioner was announced.</p>

<p>"I have your report, Falmouth," was the official's greeting;
"you did perfectly right to release Marks&mdash;have you had news
of him this morning?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"H'm," said the Commissioner thoughtfully. "I wonder
whether&mdash;" He did not finish his sentence. "Has it occurred
to you that the Four may have realised their danger?"</p>

<p>The detective's face showed surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, of course, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you considered what their probable line of action will
be?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no&mdash;unless it takes the form of an attempt to
get out of the country."</p>

<p>"Has it struck you that whilst this man Marks is looking for
them, they are probably seeking him?"</p>

<p>"Bill is smart," said the detective uneasily.</p>

<p>"So are they," said the Commissioner with an emphatic nod. "My
advice is, get in touch with Marks and put two of your best men
to watch him."</p>

<p>"That shall be done at once," replied Falmouth; "I am afraid
that it is a precaution that should have been taken before."</p>

<p>"I am going to see Sir Philip," the Commissioner went on, and
he added with a dubious smile, "I shall be obliged to frighten
him a little."</p>

<p>"What is the idea?"</p>

<p>"We wish him to drop this Bill. Have you seen the morning
papers?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"They are unanimous that the Bill should be
abandoned&mdash;they say because it is not sufficiently important
to warrant the risk, that the country itself is divided on its
merit; but as a matter of fact they are afraid of the
consequence; and upon my soul I'm a little afraid too."</p>

<p>He mounted the stairs, and was challenged at the landing by
one of his subordinates.</p>

<p>This was a system introduced after the episode of the
disguised 'detective'. The Foreign Minister was now in a state of
siege. Nobody had to be trusted, a password had been initiated,
and every precaution taken to ensure against a repetition of the
previous mistake.</p>

<p>His hand was raised to knock upon the panel of the study, when
he felt his arm gripped. He turned to see Falmouth with white
face and startled eyes.</p>

<p>"They've finished Billy," said the detective breathlessly. "He
has just been found in a railway carriage at Kensington."</p>

<p>The Commissioner whistled.</p>

<p>"How was it done?" he asked.</p>

<p>Falmouth was the picture of haggard despair.</p>

<p>"Prussic acid gas," he said bitterly; "they are scientific.
Look you, sir, persuade this man to drop his damned Bill."</p>

<p>He pointed to the door of Sir Philip's room. "We shall never
save him. I have got the feeling in my bones that he is a doomed
man."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" the Commissioner answered sharply. "You are
growing nervous&mdash;you haven't had enough sleep, Falmouth.
That isn't spoken like your real self&mdash;we must save
him."</p>

<p>He turned from the study and beckoned one of the officers who
guarded the landing.</p>

<p>"Sergeant, tell Inspector Collins to send an emergency call
throughout the area for reserves to gather immediately. I will
put such a cordon round Ramon today," he went on addressing
Falmouth, "so that no man shall reach him without the fear of
being crushed to death."</p>

<p>And within an hour there was witnessed in London a scene that
has no parallel in the history of the Metropolis. From every
district there came a small army of policemen. They arrived by
train, by tramway car, by motorbus, by every vehicle and method
of traction that could be requisitioned or seized. They streamed
from the stations, they poured through the thoroughfares, till
London stood aghast at the realisation of the strength of her
civic defences.</p>

<p>Whitehall was soon packed from end to end; St James's Park was
black with them. Automatically Whitehall, Charles Street,
Birdcage Walk, and the eastern end of the Mall were barred to all
traffic by solid phalanxes of mounted constables. St George's
Street was in the hands of the force, the roof of every house was
occupied by a uniformed man. Not a house or room that overlooked
in the slightest degree the Foreign Secretary's residence but was
subjected to a rigorous search. It was as though martial law had
been proclaimed, and indeed two regiments of Guards were under
arms the whole of the day ready for any emergency. In Sir
Philip's room the Commissioner, backed by Falmouth, made his last
appeal to the stubborn man whose life was threatened.</p>

<p>"I tell you, sir," said the Commissioner earnestly, "we can do
no more than we have done, and I am still afraid. These men
affect me as would something supernatural. I have a horrible
dread that for all our precautions we have left something out of
our reckoning; that we are leaving unguarded some avenue which by
their devilish ingenuity they may utilise. The death of this man
Marks has unnerved me&mdash;the Four are ubiquitous as well as
omnipotent. I beg of you, sir, for God's sake, think well before
you finally reject their terms. Is the passage of this Bill so
absolutely necessary?"&mdash;he paused&mdash;"is it worth your
life?" he asked with blunt directness; and the crudity of the
question made Sir Philip wince.</p>

<p>He waited some time before he replied, and when he spoke his
voice was low and firm.</p>

<p>"I shall not withdraw," he said slowly, with a dull, dogged
evenness of tone. "I shall not withdraw in any circumstance.</p>

<p>"I have gone too far," he went on, raising his hand to check
Falmouth's appeal. "I have got beyond fear, I have even got
beyond resentment; it is now to me a question of justice. Am I
right in introducing a law that will remove from this country
colonies of dangerously intelligent criminals, who, whilst
enjoying immunity from arrest, urge ignorant men forward to
commit acts of violence and treason? If I am right, the Four Just
Men are wrong. Or are they right: is this measure an unjust
thing, an act of tyranny, a piece of barbarism dropped into the
very centre of twentieth-century thought, an anachronism? If
these men are right, then I am wrong. So it has come to this,
that I have to satisfy my mind as to the standard of right and
wrong that I must accept&mdash;and I accept my own."</p>

<p>He met the wondering gaze of the officers with a calm,
unflinching countenance.</p>

<p>"You were wise to take the precautions you have," he resumed
quietly. "I have been foolish to chafe under your protective
care."</p>

<p>"We must take even further precautions," the Commissioner
interrupted; "between six and half past eight o'clock tonight we
wish you to remain in your study, and under no circumstance to
open the door to a single person&mdash;even to myself or Mr.
Falmouth. During that time you must keep your door locked." He
hesitated. "If you would rather have one of us with
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," was the Minister's quick reply; "after the
impersonation of yesterday I would rather be alone."</p>

<p>The Commissioner nodded. "This room is anarchist-proof," he
said, waving his hand round the apartment. "During the night we
have made a thorough inspection, examined the floors, the wall,
the ceiling, and fixed steel shields to the shutters."</p>

<p>He looked round the chamber with the scrutiny of a man to whom
every visible object was familiar.</p>

<p>Then he noticed something new had been introduced. On the
table stood a blue china bowl full of roses.</p>

<p>"This is new," he said, bending his head to catch the
fragrance of the beautiful flowers.</p>

<p>"Yes," was Ramon's careless reply, "they were sent from my
house in Hereford this morning."</p>

<p>The Commissioner plucked a leaf from one of the blooms and
rolled it between his fingers. "They look so real," he said
paradoxically, "that they might even be artificial."</p>

<p>As he spoke he was conscious that he associated the roses in
some way with&mdash;what?</p>

<p>He passed slowly down the noble marble stairway&mdash;a
policeman stood on every other step&mdash;and gave his views to
Falmouth.</p>

<p>"You cannot blame the old man for his decision; in fact, I
admire him today more than I have ever done before.
But"&mdash;there was a sudden solemnity in his voice&mdash;"I am
afraid&mdash;I am afraid."</p>

<p>Falmouth said nothing.</p>

<p>"The notebook tells nothing," the Commissioner continued,
"save the route that Sir Philip might have taken had he been
anxious to arrive at 44 Downing Street by back streets. The
futility of the plan is almost alarming, for there is so much
evidence of a strong subtle mind behind the seeming innocence of
this list of streets that I am confident that we have not got
hold of the true inwardness of its meaning."</p>

<p>He passed into the streets and threaded his way between crowds
of policemen. The extraordinary character of the precautions
taken by the police had the natural result of keeping the general
public ignorant of all that was happening in Downing Street.
Reporters were prohibited within the magic circle, and
newspapers, and particularly the evening newspapers, had to
depend upon such information as was grudgingly offered by
Scotland Yard. This was scanty, while their clues and theories,
which were many, were various and wonderful.</p>

<p>The <i>Megaphone</i>, the newspaper that regarded itself as
being the most directly interested in the doings of the Four Just
Men, strained every nerve to obtain news of the latest
developments. With the coming of the fatal day, excitement had
reached an extraordinary pitch; every fresh edition of the
evening newspapers was absorbed as soon as it reached the
streets. There was little material to satisfy the appetite of a
sensation-loving public, but such as there was, was given.
Pictures of 44 Downing Street, portraits of the Minister, plans
of the vicinity of the Foreign Office, with diagrams illustrating
existing police precautions, stood out from columns of
letterpress dealing, not for the first but for the dozenth time,
with the careers of the Four as revealed by their crimes.</p>

<p>And with curiosity at its height, and all London, all England,
the whole of the civilised world, talking of one thing and one
thing only there came like a bombshell the news of Marks'
death.</p>

<p>Variously described as one of the detectives engaged in the
case, as a foreign police officer, as Falmouth himself, the death
of Marks grew from 'Suicide in a Railway Carriage' to its real
importance. Within an hour the story of tragedy, inaccurate in
detail, true in substance, filled the columns of the Press.
Mystery on mystery! Who was this ill-dressed man, what part was
he playing in the great game, how came he by his death? asked the
world instantly; and little by little, pieced together by
ubiquitous newsmen, the story was made known. On top of this news
came the great police march on Whitehall. Here was evidence of
the serious view the authorities were taking.</p>

<p>'From my vantage place,' wrote Smith in the <i>Megaphone</i>,
'I could see the length of Whitehall. It was the most wonderful
spectacle that London has ever witnessed. I saw nothing but a
great sea of black helmets reaching from one end of the broad
thoroughfare to the other. Police! the whole vicinity was black
with police; they thronged side streets, they crowded into the
Park, they formed not a cordon, but a mass through which it was
impossible to penetrate.'</p>

<p>For the Commissioners of Police were leaving nothing to
chance. If they were satisfied that cunning could be matched by
cunning, craft by craft, stealth by counter-stealth, they would
have been content to defend their charge on conventional lines.
But they were outmanoeuvred. The stake was too high to depend
upon strategy&mdash;this was a case that demanded brute force. It
is difficult, writing so long after the event, to realise how the
terror of the Four had so firmly fastened upon the finest police
organisation in the world, to appreciate the panic that had come
upon a body renowned for its clearheadedness.</p>

<p>The crowd that blocked the approaches to Whitehall soon began
to grow as the news of Billy's death circulated, and soon after
two o'clock that afternoon, by order of the Commissioner,
Westminster Bridge was closed to all traffic, vehicular or
passenger. The section of the Embankment that runs between
Westminster and Hungerford Bridge was next swept by the police
and cleared of curious pedestrians; Northumberland Avenue was
barred, and before three o'clock there was no space within five
hundred yards of the official residence of Sir Philip Ramon that
was not held by a representative of the law. Members of
Parliament on their way to the House were escorted by mounted
men, and, taking on a reflected glory, were cheered by the crowd.
All that afternoon a hundred thousand people waited patiently,
seeing nothing, save, towering above the heads of a host of
constabulary, the spires and towers of the Mother of Parliaments,
or the blank faces of the buildings&mdash;in Trafalgar Square,
along the Mall as far as the police would allow them, at the
lower end of Victoria Street, eight deep along the Albert
Embankment, growing in volume every hour. London waited, waited
in patience, orderly, content to stare steadfastly at nothing,
deriving no satisfaction for their weariness but the sense of
being as near as it was humanly possible to be to the scene of a
tragedy. A stranger arriving in London, bewildered by this
gathering, asked for the cause. A man standing on the outskirts
of the Embankment throng pointed across the river with the stem
of his pipe.</p>

<p>"We're waiting for a man to be murdered," he said simply, as
one who describes a familiar function.</p>

<p>About the edge of these throngs newspaper boys drove a steady
trade. From hand to hand the pink sheets were passed over the
heads of the crowd. Every half hour brought a new edition, a new
theory, a new description of the scene in which they themselves
were playing an ineffectual if picturesque part. The clearing of
the Thames Embankment produced an edition; the closing of
Westminster Bridge brought another; the arrest of a foolish
Socialist who sought to harangue the crowd in Trafalgar Square
was worthy of another. Every incident of the day was faithfully
recorded and industriously devoured.</p>

<p>All that afternoon they waited, telling and retelling the
story of the Four, theorising, speculating, judging. And they
spoke of the culmination as one speaks of a promised spectacle,
watching the slow-moving hands of Big Ben ticking off the laggard
minutes. "Only two more hours to wait," they said at six o'clock,
and that sentence, or rather the tone of pleasurable anticipation
in which it was said, indicated the spirit of the mob. For a mob
is a cruel thing, heartless and unpitying.</p>

<p>Seven o'clock boomed forth, and the angry hum of talk ceased.
London watched in silence, and with a quicker beating heart, the
last hour crawl round the great clock's dial.</p>

<p>There had been a slight alteration in the arrangements at
Downing Street, and it was after seven o'clock before Sir Philip,
opening the door of his study, in which he had sat alone,
beckoned the Commissioner and Falmouth to approach. They walked
towards him, stopping a few feet from where he stood.</p>

<p>The Minister was pale, and there were lines on his face that
had not been there before. But the hand that held the printed
paper was steady and his face was sphinxlike.</p>

<p>"I am about to lock my door," he said calmly. "I presume that
the arrangements we have agreed upon will be carried out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered the Commissioner quietly.</p>

<p>Sir Philip was about to speak, but he checked himself.</p>

<p>After a moment he spoke again.</p>

<p>"I have been a just man according to my lights," he said half
to himself. "Whatever happens I am satisfied that I am doing the
right thing&mdash;What is that?"</p>

<p>Through the corridor there came a faint roar.</p>

<p>"The people&mdash;they are cheering you," said Falmouth, who
just before had made a tour of inspection.</p>

<p>The Minister's lip curled in disdain and the familiar acid
crept into his voice.</p>

<p>"They will be terribly disappointed if nothing happens," he
said bitterly. "The people! God save me from the people, their
sympathy, their applause, their insufferable pity."</p>

<p>He turned and pushed open the door of his study, slowly closed
the heavy portal, and the two men heard the snick of the lock as
he turned the key.</p>

<p>Falmouth looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Forty minutes," was his laconic comment.</p>

<p>In the dark stood the Four Men.</p>

<p>"It is nearly time," said the voice of Manfred, and Thery
shuffled forward and groped on the floor for something.</p>

<p>"Let me strike a match," he grumbled in Spanish.</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>It was Poiccart's sharp voice that arrested him; it was
Gonsalez who stooped quickly and passed sensitive fingers over
the floor.</p>

<p>He found one wire and placed it in Thery's hand, then he
reached up and found the other, and Thery deftly tied them
together.</p>

<p>"Is it not time?" asked Thery, short of breath from his
exertions.</p>

<p>"Wait."</p>

<p>Manfred was examining the illuminated dial of his watch. In
silence they waited.</p>

<p>"It is time," said Manfred solemnly, and Thery stretched out
his hand.</p>

<p>Stretched out his hand&mdash;and groaned and collapsed.</p>

<p>The three heard the groan, felt rather than saw the swaying
figure of the man, and heard the thud of him as he struck the
floor.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" whispered a tremorless voice; it was
Gonsalez.</p>

<p>Manfred was at Thery's side fumbling at his shirt.</p>

<p>"Thery has bungled and paid the consequence," he said in a
hushed voice.</p>

<p>"But Ramon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We shall see, we shall see," said Manfred, still with his
fingers over the heart of the fallen man.</p>

<p>That forty minutes was the longest that Falmouth ever
remembered spending. He had tried to pass it pleasantly by
recounting some of the famous criminal cases in which he had
played a leading role. But he found his tongue wandering after
his mind. He grew incoherent, almost hysterical. The word had
been passed round that there was to be no talking in tones above
a whisper, and absolute silence reigned, save an occasional
sibilant murmur as a necessary question was asked or
answered.</p>

<p>Policemen were established in every room, on the roof, in the
basement, in every corridor, and each man was armed. Falmouth
looked round. He sat in the secretary's office, having arranged
for Hamilton to be at the House. Every door stood wide open,
wedged back, so that no group of policemen should be out of sight
of another.</p>

<p>"I cannot think what can happen," he whispered for the
twentieth time to his superior. "It is impossible for those
fellows to keep their promise&mdash;absolutely impossible."</p>

<p>"The question, to my mind, is whether they will keep their
other promise," was the Commissioner's reply, "whether having
found that they have failed they will give up their attempt. One
thing is certain," he proceeded, "if Ramon comes out of this
alive, his rotten Bill will pass without opposition."</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. To be exact, he had held his watch in
his hand since Sir Philip had entered his room.</p>

<p>"It wants five minutes." He sighed anxiously.</p>

<p>He walked softly to the door of Sir Philip's room and
listened.</p>

<p>"I can hear nothing," he said.</p>

<p>The next five minutes passed more slowly than any of the
preceding.</p>

<p>"It is just on the hour," said Falmouth in a strained voice.
"We have&mdash;"</p>

<p>The distant chime of Big Ben boomed once.</p>

<p>"The hour!" he whispered, and both men listened.</p>

<p>"Two," muttered Falmouth, counting the strokes.</p>

<p>"Three."</p>

<p>"Four."</p>

<p>"Five&mdash;what's that?" he muttered quickly.</p>

<p>"I heard nothing&mdash;yes, I heard something." He sprang to
the door and bent his head to the level of the keyhole. "What is
that? What&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then from the room came a quick, sharp cry of pain, a
crash&mdash;and silence.</p>

<p>"Quick&mdash;this way, men!" shouted Falmouth, and threw his
weight against the door.</p>

<p>It did not yield a fraction of an inch.</p>

<p>"Together!"</p>

<p>Three burly constables flung themselves against the panels,
and the door smashed open.</p>

<p>Falmouth and the Commissioner ran into the room.</p>

<p>"My God!" cried Falmouth in horror.</p>

<p>Sprawled across the table at which he had been sitting was the
figure of the Foreign Secretary.</p>

<p>The paraphernalia that littered his table had been thrown to
the floor as in a struggle.</p>

<p>The Commissioner stepped to the fallen man and raised him. One
look at the face was sufficient.</p>

<p>"Dead!" he whispered hoarsely. He looked around&mdash;save for
the police and the dead man the room was empty.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11">XI. &mdash; A NEWSPAPER
CUTTING</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE court was again crowded today in
anticipation of the evidence of the Assistant Commissioner of
Police and Sir Francis Katling, the famous surgeon. Before the
proceedings recommenced the Coroner remarked that he had received
a great number of letters from all kinds of people containing
theories, some of them peculiarly fantastic, as to the cause of
Sir Philip Ramon's death.</p>

<p>"The police inform me that they are eager to receive
suggestions," said the Coroner, "and will welcome any view
however bizarre."</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner of Police was the first witness
called, and gave in detail the story of the events that had led
up to the finding of the late Secretary's dead body. He then went
on to describe the appearance of the room. Heavy bookcases filled
two sides of the room, the third or south-west was pierced with
three windows, the fourth was occupied by a case containing maps
arranged on the roller principle.</p>

<p>Were the windows fastened?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>And adequately protected?&mdash;Yes; by wooden folding
shutters sheathed with steel.</p>

<p>Was there any indication that these had been tampered
with?&mdash;None whatever.</p>

<p>Did you institute a search of the room?&mdash;Yes; a minute
search.</p>

<p>By the Foreman of the Jury: Immediately?&mdash;Yes: after the
body was removed every article of furniture was taken out of the
room, the carpets were taken up, and the walls and ceilings
stripped.</p>

<p>And nothing was found?&mdash;Nothing.</p>

<p>Is there a fireplace in the room?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Was there any possibility of any person effecting an entrance
by that method?&mdash;Absolutely none.</p>

<p>You have seen the newspapers?&mdash;Yes; some of them.</p>

<p>You have seen the suggestion put forward that the deceased was
slain by the introduction of a deadly gas?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Was that possible?&mdash;I hardly think so.</p>

<p>By the Foreman: Did you find any means by which such a gas
could be introduced?&mdash;(The witness hesitated.) None, except
an old disused gaspipe that had an opening above the desk.
(Sensation.)</p>

<p>Was there any indication of the presence of such a gas?</p>

<p>&mdash;Absolutely none.</p>

<p>No smell?&mdash;None whatever.</p>

<p>But there are gases which are at once deadly and
scentless&mdash;carbon dioxide, for example?&mdash;Yes; there
are.</p>

<p>By the Foreman: Did you test the atmosphere for the presence
of such a gas?&mdash;No; but I entered the room before it would
have had time to dissipate; I should have noticed it.</p>

<p>Was the room disarranged in any way?&mdash;Except for the
table there was no disarrangement.</p>

<p>Did you find the contents of the table
disturbed?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Will you describe exactly the appearance of the table?</p>

<p>&mdash;One or two heavy articles of table furniture, such as
the silver candlesticks, etc., alone remained in their positions.
On the floor were a number of papers, the inkstand, a pen, and
(here the witness drew a notecase from his pocket and extracted a
small black shrivelled object) a smashed flower bowl and a number
of roses.</p>

<p>Did you find anything in the dead man's hand?&mdash;Yes, I
found this.</p>

<p>The detective held up a withered rosebud, and a thrill of
horror ran through the court.</p>

<p>That is a rose?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>The Coroner consulted the Commissioner's written report.</p>

<p>Did you notice anything peculiar about the hand?&mdash;Yes,
where the flower had been there was a round black stain.
(Sensation.)</p>

<p>Can you account for that?&mdash;No.</p>

<p>By the Foreman: What steps did you take when you discovered
this?&mdash;I had the flowers carefully collected and as much of
the water as was possible absorbed by clean blotting-paper: these
were sent to the Home Office for analysis.</p>

<p>Do you know the result of that analysis?&mdash;So far as I
know, it has revealed nothing.</p>

<p>Did the analysis include leaves from the rose you have in your
possession?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>The Assistant Commissioner then went on to give details of the
police arrangements for the day. It was impossible, he
emphatically stated, for any person to have entered or left 44
Downing Street without being observed. Immediately after the
murder the police on duty were ordered to stand fast. Most of the
men, said the witness, were on duty for twenty-six hours at a
stretch.</p>

<p>At this stage there was revealed the most sensational feature
of the inquiry. It came with dramatic suddenness, and was the
result of a question put by the Coroner, who constantly referred
to the Commissioner's signed statement that lay before him.</p>

<p>You know of a man called Thery?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>He was one of a band calling themselves 'The Four Just
Men'?&mdash;I believe so.</p>

<p>A reward was offered for his apprehension?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>He was suspected of complicity in the plot to murder Sir
Philip Ramon?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Has he been found?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>This monosyllabic reply drew a spontaneous cry of surprise
from the crowded court.</p>

<p>When was he found?&mdash;This morning.</p>

<p>Where?&mdash;On Romney Marshes.</p>

<p>Was he dead?&mdash;Yes. (Sensation.)</p>

<p>Was there anything peculiar about the body? (The whole court
waited for the answer with bated breath.)&mdash;Yes; on his right
palm was a stain similar to that found on the hand of Sir Philip
Ramon!</p>

<p>A shiver ran through the crowd of listeners.</p>

<p>Was a rose found in his hand also?&mdash;No.</p>

<p>By the Foreman: Was there any indication how Thery came to
where he was found?&mdash;None.</p>

<p>The witness added that no papers or documents of any kind were
found upon the man.</p>

<p>Sir Francis Katling was the next witness.</p>

<p>He was sworn and was accorded permission to give his evidence
from the solicitor's table, on which he had spread the voluminous
notes of his observations. For half an hour he devoted himself to
a purely technical record of his examinations. There were three
possible causes of death. It might have been natural: the man's
weak heart was sufficient to cause such; it might have been by
asphyxiation; it might have been the result of a blow that by
some extraordinary means left no contusion.</p>

<p>There were no traces of poison?&mdash;None.</p>

<p>You have heard the evidence of the last
witness?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>And that portion of the evidence that dealt with a black
stain?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Did you examine that stain?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Have you formed any theories regarding it?&mdash;Yes; it seems
to me as if it were formed by an acid.</p>

<p>Carbolic acid, for instance?&mdash;Yes; but there was no
indication of any of the acids of commerce.</p>

<p>You saw the man Thery's hand?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Was the stain of a similar character?&mdash;Yes, but larger
and more irregular.</p>

<p>Were there any signs of acid?&mdash;None.</p>

<p>By the Foreman: You have seen many of the fantastic theories
put forward by the Press and public?&mdash;Yes; I have paid
careful attention to them.</p>

<p>And you see nothing in them that would lead you to believe
that the deceased met his end by the method
suggested?&mdash;No.</p>

<p>Gas?&mdash;Impossible; it must have been immediately
detected.</p>

<p>The introduction into the room of some subtle poison that
would asphyxiate and leave no trace?&mdash;Such a drug is unknown
to medical science.</p>

<p>You have seen the rose found in Sir Philip's
hand?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>How do you account for that?&mdash;I cannot account for
it.</p>

<p>Nor for the stain?&mdash;No.</p>

<p>By the Foreman: You have formed no definite opinion regarding
the cause of death?&mdash;No; I merely submit one of the three
suggestions I have offered.</p>

<p>Are you a believer in hypnotism?&mdash;Yes, to a certain
extent.</p>

<p>In hypnotic suggestion?&mdash;Again, to a certain extent.</p>

<p>Is it possible that the suggestion of death coming at a
certain hour so persistently threatened might have led to
death?&mdash;I do not quite understand you.</p>

<p>Is it possible that the deceased is a victim to hypnotic
suggestion?&mdash;I do not believe it possible.</p>

<p>By the Foreman: You speak of a blow leaving no contusion. In
your experience have you ever seen such a case?&mdash;Yes;
twice.</p>

<p>But a blow sufficient to cause death?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Without leaving a bruise or any mark whatever?&mdash;Yes; I
saw a case in Japan where a man by exerting a peculiar pressure
on the throat produced instant death.</p>

<p>Is that ordinary?&mdash;No; it is very unordinary;
sufficiently so to create a considerable stir in medical circles.
The case was recorded in the British Medical Journal in 1896.</p>

<p>And there was no contusion or bruise?&mdash;Absolutely none
whatever.</p>

<p>The famous surgeon then read a long extract from the British
Medical Journal bearing out this statement.</p>

<p>Would you say that the deceased died in this way?&mdash;It is
possible.</p>

<p>By the Foreman: Do you advance that as a serious
possibility?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>With a few more questions of a technical character the
examination closed.</p>

<p>As the great surgeon left the box there was a hum of
conversation, and keen disappointment was felt on all sides. It
had been hoped that the evidence of the medical expert would have
thrown light into dark places, but it left the mystery of Sir
Philip Ramon's death as far from explanation as ever.</p>

<p>Superintendent Falmouth was the next witness called.</p>

<p>The detective, who gave his evidence in clear tones, was
evidently speaking under stress of very great emotion. He seemed
to appreciate very keenly the failure of the police to safeguard
the life of the dead Minister. It is an open secret that
immediately after the tragedy both the officer and the Assistant
Commissioner tendered their resignations, which, at the express
instruction of the Prime Minister, were not accepted.</p>

<p>Mr. Falmouth repeated a great deal of the evidence already
given by the Commissioner, and told the story of how he had stood
on duty outside the Foreign Secretary's door at the moment of the
tragedy. As he detailed the events of that evening a deathly
silence came upon the court.</p>

<p>You say you heard a noise proceeding from the
study?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>What sort of a noise?&mdash;Well, it is hard to describe what
I heard; it was one of those indefinite noises that sounded like
a chair being pulled across a soft surface.</p>

<p>Would it be a noise like the sliding of a door or
panel?&mdash;Yes. (Sensation.)</p>

<p>That is the noise as you described it in your
report?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Was any panel discovered?&mdash;No.</p>

<p>Or any sliding door?&mdash;No.</p>

<p>Would it have been possible for a person to have secreted
himself in any of the bureaux or bookcases?&mdash;No; these were
examined.</p>

<p>What happened next?&mdash;I heard a click and a cry from Sir
Philip, and endeavoured to burst open the door.</p>

<p>By the Foreman: It was locked?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>And Sir Philip was alone?&mdash;Yes; it was by his wish: a
wish expressed earlier in the day.</p>

<p>After the tragedy did you make a systematic search both inside
and outside the house?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>Did you make any discovery?&mdash;None, except that I made a
discovery curious in itself, but having no possible bearing on
the case now.</p>

<p>What was this?&mdash;Well, it was the presence on the
window-sill of the room of two dead sparrows.</p>

<p>Were these examined?&mdash;Yes; but the surgeon who dissected
them gave the opinion that they died from exposure and had fallen
from the parapet above.</p>

<p>Was there any trace of poison in these birds?&mdash;None that
could be discovered.</p>

<p>At this point Sir Francis Katling was recalled. He had seen
the birds. He could find no trace of poison.</p>

<p>Granted the possibility of such a gas as we have already
spoken of&mdash;a deadly gas with the property of rapid
dissipation&mdash;might not the escape of a minute quantity of
such a fume bring about the death of these birds?&mdash;Yes, if
they were resting on the window-sill.</p>

<p>By the Foreman: Do you connect these birds with the
tragedy?&mdash;I do not, replied the witness emphatically.</p>

<p>Superintendent Falmouth resumed his evidence.</p>

<p>Were there any other curious features that struck
you?&mdash;None.</p>

<p>The Coroner proceeded to question the witness concerning the
relations of Marks with the police.</p>

<p>Was the stain found on Sir Philip's hand, and on the hand of
the man Thery, found also on Marks?&mdash;No.</p>

<p>It was as the court was dispersing, and little groups of men
stood discussing the most extraordinary verdict ever given by a
coroner's jury, 'Death from some unknown cause, and wilful murder
against some person or persons unknown', that the Coroner himself
met on the threshold of the court a familiar face.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Carson!" he said in surprise, "you here too; I should
have thought that your bankrupts kept you busy&mdash;even on a
day like this&mdash;extraordinary case."</p>

<p>"Extraordinary," agreed the other.</p>

<p>"Were you there all the time?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the spectator.</p>

<p>"Did you notice what a bright foreman we had?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I think he would make a smarter lawyer than a company
promoter."</p>

<p>"You know him, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes," yawned the Official Receiver; "poor devil, he thought
he was going to set the Thames on fire, floated a company to
reproduce photogravures and things&mdash;took Etherington's off
our hands, but it's back again."</p>

<p>"Has he failed?" asked the Coroner in surprise.</p>

<p>"Not exactly failed. He's just given it up, says the climate
doesn't suit him&mdash;what is his name again?"</p>

<p>"Manfred," said the Coroner.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12">XII. &mdash; CONCLUSION</a></h2>

<p class="first">FALMOUTH sat on the opposite side of the Chief
Commissioner's desk, his hands clasped before him. On the
blotting-pad lay a thin sheet of grey notepaper. The Commissioner
picked it up again and re-read it.</p>

<p class="letter">When you receive this [it ran] we who for want
of a better title call ourselves The Four Just Men will be
scattered throughout Europe, and there is little likelihood of
your ever tracing us. In no spirit of boastfulness we say: We
have accomplished that which we set ourselves to accomplish. In
no sense of hypocrisy we repeat our regret that such a step as we
took was necessary.</p>

<p class="letter">Sir Philip Ramon's death would appear to have
been an accident. This much we confess. Thery bungled&mdash;and
paid the penalty. We depended too much upon his technical
knowledge. Perhaps by diligent search you will solve the mystery
of Sir Philip Ramon's death&mdash;when such a search is rewarded
you will realise the truth of this statement. Farewell.</p>

<p>"It tells us nothing," said the Commissioner. Falmouth shook
his head despairingly. "Search!" he said bitterly; "we have
searched the house in Downing Street from end to end&mdash;where
else can we search?"</p>

<p>"Is there no paper amongst Sir Philip's documents that might
conceivably put you on the track?"</p>

<p>"None that we have seen."</p>

<p>The chief bit the end of his pen thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Has his country house been examined?"</p>

<p>Falmouth frowned.</p>

<p>"I didn't think that necessary."</p>

<p>"Nor Portland Place?"</p>

<p>"No: it was locked up at the time of the murder."</p>

<p>The Commissioner rose.</p>

<p>"Try Portland Place," he advised. "At present it is in the
hands of Sir Philip's executors."</p>

<p>The detective hailed a hansom, and in a quarter of an hour
found himself knocking upon the gloomy portals of the late
Foreign Secretary's town house. A grave manservant opened the
door; it was Sir Philip's butler, a man known to Falmouth, who
greeted him with a nod.</p>

<p>"I want to make a search of the house, Perks," he said. "Has
anything been touched?"</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Falmouth," he replied, "everything is just as Sir
Philip left it. The lawyer gentlemen have not even made an
inventory."</p>

<p>Falmouth walked through the chilly hall to the comfortable
little room set apart for the butler.</p>

<p>"I should like to start with the study," he said.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there will be a difficulty, then, sir," said Perks
respectfully.</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Falmouth sharply.</p>

<p>"It is the only room in the house for which we have no key.
Sir Philip had a special lock for his study and carried the key
with him. You see, being a Cabinet Minister, and a very careful
man, he was very particular about people entering his study."</p>

<p>Falmouth thought.</p>

<p>A number of Sir Philip's private keys were deposited at
Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>He scribbled a brief note to his chief and sent a footman by
cab to the Yard.</p>

<p>Whilst he was waiting he sounded the butler.</p>

<p>"Where were you when the murder was committed, Perks?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"In the country: Sir Philip sent away all the servants, you
will remember."</p>

<p>"And the house?"</p>

<p>"Was empty&mdash;absolutely empty."</p>

<p>"Was there any evidence on your return that any person had
effected an entrance?"</p>

<p>"None, sir; it would be next to impossible to burgle this
house. There are alarm wires fixed communicating with the police
station, and the windows are automatically locked."</p>

<p>"There were no marks on the doors or windows that would lead
you to believe that an entrance had been attempted?"</p>

<p>The butler shook his head emphatically.</p>

<p>"None; in the course of my daily duty I make a very careful
inspection of the paintwork, and I should have noticed any marks
of the kind."</p>

<p>In half an hour the footman, accompanied by a detective,
returned, and Falmouth took from the plain-clothed officer a
small bunch of keys.</p>

<p>The butler led the way to the first floor.</p>

<p>He indicated the study, a massive oaken door, fitted with a
microscopic lock.</p>

<p>Very carefully Falmouth made his selection of keys. Twice he
tried unsuccessfully, but at the third attempt the lock turned
with a click, and the door opened noiselessly.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment at the entrance, for the room was in
darkness.</p>

<p>"I forgot," said Perks, "the shutters are closed&mdash;shall I
open them?"</p>

<p>"If you please," said the detective.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the room was flooded with light.</p>

<p>It was a plainly furnished apartment, rather similar in
appearance to that in which the Foreign Secretary met his end. It
smelt mustily of old leather, and the walls of the room were
covered with bookshelves. In the centre stood a big mahogany
writing-table, with bundles of papers neatly arranged.</p>

<p>Falmouth took a rapid and careful survey of this desk. It was
thick with accumulated dust. At one end, within reach of the
vacant chair stood an ordinary table telephone.</p>

<p>"No bells," said Falmouth.</p>

<p>"No," replied the butler. "Sir Philip disliked
bells&mdash;there is a 'buzzer'."</p>

<p>Falmouth remembered.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said quickly. "I remember&mdash;hullo!"</p>

<p>He bent forward eagerly.</p>

<p>"Why, what has happened to the telephone?"</p>

<p>He might well ask, for its steel was warped and twisted.
Beneath where the vulcanite receiver stood was a tiny heap of
black ash, and of the flexible cord that connected it with the
outside world nothing remained but a twisted piece of discoloured
wire.</p>

<p>The table on which it stood was blistered as with some great
heat.</p>

<p>The detective drew a long breath.</p>

<p>He turned to his subordinate.</p>

<p>"Run across to Miller's in Regent Street&mdash;the
electrician&mdash;and ask Mr. Miller to come here at once."</p>

<p>He was still standing gazing at the telephone when the
electrician arrived.</p>

<p>"Mr. Miller," said Falmouth slowly, "what has happened to this
telephone?"</p>

<p>The electrician adjusted his pince-nez and inspected the
ruin.</p>

<p>"H'm," he said, "it rather looks as though some linesman had
been criminally careless."</p>

<p>"Linesman? What do you mean?" demanded Falmouth.</p>

<p>"I mean the workmen engaged to fix telephone wires." He made
another inspection.</p>

<p>"Cannot you see?"</p>

<p>He pointed to the battered instrument.</p>

<p>"I see that the machine is entirely ruined&mdash;but why?"</p>

<p>The electrician stooped and picked up the scorched wire from
the ground.</p>

<p>"What I mean is this," he said. "Somebody has attached a wire
carrying a high voltage&mdash;probably an electric-lighting
wire&mdash;to this telephone line: and if anybody had happened to
have been at&mdash;" He stopped suddenly, and his face went
white.</p>

<p>"Good God!" he whispered, "Sir Philip Ramon was
electrocuted!"</p>

<p>For a while not one of the party spoke. Then Falmouth's hand
darted into his pocket and he drew out the little notebook which
Billy Marks had stolen.</p>

<p>"That is the solution," he cried; "here is the direction the
wires took &mdash;but how is it that the telephone at Downing
Street was not destroyed in a similar manner?"</p>

<p>The electrician, white and shaking, shook his head
impatiently.</p>

<p>"I have given up trying to account for the vagaries of
electricity," he said; "besides, the current, the full force of
the current, might have been diverted&mdash;a short circuit might
have been effected&mdash;anything might have happened."</p>

<p>"Wait!" said Falmouth eagerly. "Suppose the man making the
connection had bungled&mdash;had taken the full force of the
current himself&mdash;would that have brought about this
result?"</p>

<p>"It might&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Thery bungled&mdash;and paid the penalty,'" quoted Falmouth
slowly. "Ramon got a slight shock&mdash;sufficient to frighten
him&mdash;he had a weak heart&mdash;the burn on his hand, the
dead sparrows! By Heaven! it's as clear as daylight!"</p>

<p>Later, a strong force of police raided the house in Carnaby
Street, but they found nothing&mdash;except a half-smoked
cigarette bearing the name of a London tobacconist, and the
counterfoil of a passage ticket to New York.</p>

<p>It was marked per RMS 'Lucania', and was for three first-class
passengers.</p>

<p>When the Lucania arrived at New York she was searched from
stem to stern, but the Four Just Men were not discovered.</p>

<p>It was Gonsalez who had placed the 'clue' for the police to
find.</p>
