<h2><a name="preface"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>There is this difference between science and history: each
scientific discovery brings new knowledge: by contrast, facts uncovered
and recorded by the historian were invariably known to some people at
some time: sometimes widely known and well recorded at the time.</p>

<p>But these facts may have become obscured or forgotten, or even as
recorded may have acquired a new interest or significance.</p>

<p>Therefore, while there is in the story now presented nothing that is
literally new; and although the story of Sturt's life has been told
with skill and affection by his daughter-in-law, Mrs. Napier (Beatrix
M.) Sturt, there is some justification for this new attempt to tell the
story.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sturt's <i>Life of Charles Sturt</i> was published fifty years
ago, has long been out of print, and copies are difficult to obtain,
except in libraries. This is even more true of Sturt's own publications
describing his expeditions down the Macquarie and Murray Rivers, and
into Central Australia.</p>

<p>For these reasons the present generation of Australians cannot
easily learn the story of one who played a courageous and altogether
notable part for twenty-five of the most fateful years of the early
period of our nation's history.</p>

<p>Also, even if the public had easy access to these books, it is
difficult to relate the routes followed by Sturt to modern place-names,
and the story is much more interesting when it can be followed step by
step on a modern map.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sturt, also, was under a great disadvantage in never having
visited Australia.</p>

<p>But the main consideration which, in the author's opinion, justifies
the presentation of this "twice told tale" at this time, is that while
the beliefs, ideals and aspirations which for centuries have inspired
man's nobler efforts have become temporarily submerged in the struggle
for survival, a book like this, which tells the story of a man whose
ideal was service, and who was prepared to die in that service, might
be timely, and might even be welcomed by a large body of young
readers.</p>

<h2><a name="intro"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>While it is true, as already stated, that this book contains little
that is new, yet documents have come to light, letters have been
collected; and through these, and the other varied channels by which
history is revealed, information beyond that available fifty years ago
can now be consulted.</p>

<p>The continuous and patient work of the Royal Historical and Royal
Geographical Societies, and of many individuals, has determined points
of detail and settled topographical locations, so that the principal
task in a work of this kind is the assembling of material already
available.</p>

<p>One point should be stated here. In naming places, particularly
streams, Sturt used the old style of possessive adjectives, for
example, Cooper's Creek: geographers have, however, agreed that this
style shall be replaced by the simple name, such as Cooper Creek. This
modern style has, therefore, been followed throughout. That it has,
occasionally, unfortunate results, must be recognised, for example,
"Flood Creek" conveys a wrong impression concerning the origin of the
name.</p>

<p>The maps in this volume are not cartographically accurate, but they
do convey correct information adequate for the general reader.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I - The Early Years</h2>

<p>About the middle of May 1827 the ship <i>Mariner</i> was forging
eastward with long lunges driven by a strong cold wind under a wet dead
sky: no one on board without previous knowledge would have guessed that
the bright land of their new life was then to the north of them.</p>

<p>Standing by the port rail of the quarterdeck was one man who knew
it; and whose memories and forebodings were stirred by the knowledge.
For him the warm sunlight of Cape Town was fading to a pleasant dream,
the sullen rollers a depressing illusion of immobility and desolation,
and the solitary albatross a symbol of life spent in ceaseless movement
with an uncertain goal and an unknown destiny.</p>

<p>These things affected his thoughts and produced a mental depression
which was to recur more than once in later life.</p>

<p>He was a professional soldier--a captain of the 39th Regiment of
Foot--and as he looked back to the west he reviewed the past and all
that he was leaving. His career as a soldier began when, at the age of
eighteen years, he had, through the patronage of the Prince Regent,
been gazetted ensign in the 39th Regiment. Service in the Pyrenees
against the French was followed by service in Canada against the
Americans, soon ended by the hurried recall of the regiment after
Napoleon's escape from Elba. As they arrived in France after Waterloo
the regiment served as part of the army of occupation in France until
the end of 1818.</p>

<p>He had had, therefore, five years of varied experience--the first
two on service under active warfare conditions, the last three on
garrison duty.</p>

<p>From 1818 to 1825 the regiment was on duty in Ireland, without
incident especially affecting his personal career but involving long
delay in military promotion. He was twenty-eight years old when he, at
last, became Lieutenant; and, at thirty, he became Captain. Then,
removed from Ireland to Chatham, he was sent in charge of a detachment
of the regiment as guard over convicts on this present voyage to New
South Wales, which had begun in December, 1826.</p>

<p>He remembered his boyhood and his family life. He could barely
remember his childhood in India as he had been, in his fifth year, sent
with his elder sister to England to live with their mother's sisters. A
happy childhood lasted until his fifteenth year when,, on his parents'
return to England, he was sent to Harrow. Memories of his happy days
with his uncle Charles, who taught him the management of small boats;
with his sister Susan, with his cousin Isaac Wood, were clouded by the
unhappiness and misfortunes of his father, Napier Sturt.</p>

<p>Napier Sturt was a judge in Bengal under the East India Company, and
it was shortly after his marriage that the prospects of easy wealth,
which was the main attraction to India, had been greatly reduced by the
impeachment of Warren Hastings. His second son, Charles, was born on
28th April, 1795, in the, very month of Hastings' acquittal.</p>

<p>A large family--there were eight sons--unsuccessful speculation,
failure of an Indian bank, gravely affected the economic position of
the family and saddened the family life.</p>

<p>He remembered with quiet satisfaction that in respect of family and
ancestry he was, in the standard of those times, of "good birth." The
Sturts and the Napiers were Dorsetshire county families of standing.
But he remembered that his grandmother was a confirmed gambler for high
stakes and that all her fifteen children, including his own father,
were distinguished for good looks, fine manners, and the fatal habit of
being in debt.</p>

<p>All this passed through his mind as he stood there. He, a soldier
without influence, for whom promotion had already been very slow, was
posted on service in a lonely outpost at a time when there seemed no
possibility of war, with its chances of quick promotion, and no
prospect of promotion otherwise. He was in his thirty-third year, with
no hope of marriage on his pay. And he had already in his mind
prejudged and condemned this new country which, as yet, he still could
not see--he condemned it because of the uninteresting nature of the
military service there; and because of the character of the
population--the majority being convicts.</p>

<p>He admitted later that these prejudices were formed in complete
ignorance of the real conditions, but his depression as he shivered in
his great coat was real enough.</p>

<p>The master of the ship, sensing this, came over from the other side
of the deck and told him that within the next few days they would have
turned the corner and would be moving northward into, if the glass did
not lie, calmer seas and warmer weather. And so it was; within a few
days the ship was moving northwards under full sail driven by a
southerly breeze, yielding easily to the gentle Pacific swell, and the
young army officer, well forward on the forecastle deck, enjoying the
warm sun, was examining all that he could see of this new country.</p>

<p>Behind the flat, heavily-timbered coast were the ranges, sometimes
coming down to the sea, sometimes very distant, but always dominating
the landscape. No one on board could tell him what was behind the
ranges, but he wondered with that wonder which was to be the consuming
passion of his life.</p>

<p>For two or three days the weather remained bright and fresh, but, on
the morning of 23rd May* the wind changed to a light north-easterly
breeze, and on a crisp bright autumn morning the ship turned in between
South Head with its Macquarie Tower and the bold, flat face of North
Head. The ship moved gently up the Harbour, taking in sail after sail
until she came to anchor in Sydney Cove, and Charles Sturt came to the
country which was to be his home for twenty-six years, and his major
interest for life. With him came his faithful soldier-servant Joseph
Harris, who "would never leave him."**</p>

<p>(* Both Mrs. Sturt and Sturt himself give other dates; but this date
is correct.)</p>

<p>(** See Appendix D, Note 1.)</p>

<p>Sturt wrote of his own feeling on this occasion:</p>

<p>[1-1]"With mingled feelings I gazed for the first time on the bold
cliffs at the entrance to Port Jackson, nor did I anticipate anything
equal to the scene as we sailed up that noble and extensive basin. The
fact was, I had not conceived, from anything I had read or heard that,
in that remote region, so extensive a town could have been reared in so
brief a period. It is the very triumph of human skill and industry over
Nature.</p>

<p class="ref">[1-1. Life p.22.]</p>

<p>"In a climate so soft that man scarcely requires a dwelling, and so
enchanting that few have left it but with regret, the spirits must
needs be acted upon, and the heart feel lighter. Such, indeed, I have
myself found to be the case; nor have I ever been happier than when
roving through the woods or wandering along one of the silent and
beautiful bays for which the harbour of Port Jackson is
celebrated."</p>

<p>He never lost this admiration and affection for Australia.</p>

<p>This young man, whose name will be always part of Australian
history, was 5 feet 10&frac34; inches in height, and had brown hair,
bright blue eyes, an aquiline nose, and sensitive, rather humorous
mouth.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II - First Years in Sydney</h2>

<p>It may be assumed that, having reported himself to his commanding
officer, Colonel Lindesay, disposed of his detachment of soldiers,
delivered the convicts, and taken up his quarters in barracks, he made
his duty call on the Governor, General Ralph Darling.</p>

<p>From that moment he could not escape the obligation of making a
decision as to where his sympathies and loyalties would be; from that
moment he was drawn, even if he did not fully realize it at first, into
the net of Civil Service officialism and intrigue in which his personal
interests suffered, and from which he was never again entirely
free.</p>

<p>His call on the Governor would have been made straight into a
familiar "army" atmosphere. With the Governor he would have met
Darling's two brothers-in-law, Henry and William Dumaresq--all three of
them army officers, Henry being now Clerk to the Executive Council; and
he would soon have realized that Darling was facing his difficult task
with a very rigid official attitude. For Darling's task was difficult:
his instructions were to develop the more democratic system of local
autonomy introduced in 1824 and to encourage local civil
responsibility. In this he failed to please either those who were
opposed to change, or those who demanded even greater changes. Sturt
may have heard of the memorial presented to Darling on his arrival in
1825, telling him in rather forcible terms that there were locally-born
Australians who were fired by a rather self-assertive local patriotism
and who, for example, urged in one memorial to the Home[2-1] Government
that the mere circumstance of having been born in New South Wales
should not preclude them from receiving grants of land. He would have
watched the proceedings when Governor Darling took the unusual course
in October, 1827, of instituting libel proceedings against Wardell of
the "Australian" newspaper.</p>

<p class="ref">[2-1 H.R.A. XII. xiii: XII. 147.]</p>

<p>There is no indication that he was, during the first six months of
his residence, moved by any of these happenings to ally himself with
any of the factions.</p>

<p>Nor is there any indication that he was affected by the social
revolution in Europe: Waterloo was only twelve years away, and all
Europe, except France, was obsessed with the fear that the "terror"
would spread to other countries. Sturt's youth and early manhood saw
the gathering of the waters for that great tidal wave of common
humanity which was to swell increasingly through, and beyond, the
nineteenth century. The first drops of spray from this were being felt
in Sydney when he arrived. At this stage there was in him a striking
singleness of purpose. But by November, 1827, he had become Military
Secretary to the Governor, and this allegiance kept him strictly within
the limits of loyalty to Govern. men t House.</p>

<p>In this official capacity he appears only once. On 23rd March 1828,
he wrote, by direction, to Captain Robison enquiring[2-2] whether, in
letters to England, Robison had made charges against the Governor and,
if so, requesting him to furnish copies of the charges. Sturt was not
further concerned officially in this matter although Darling felt
justified, in April, 1828, in reporting acidly to the authorities in
England that Captain Robison's continuance[2-3] in the service could
not fail to prove in the last degree injurious to it.</p>

<p class="ref">[2-2 H.R.A. XIV. 106.]</p>

<p class="ref">[2-3 H.R.A. XIV. 111.]</p>

<p>Other evidence suggests that none of these local matters held any
attraction for Sturt, but although he was an officer trained for
military career, it is easy to imagine him, with others all round him
seeking prosperity by novel means and speculating heavily is livestock
ventures, examining his future prospects with some anxiety He had been
fourteen years in the army, was thirty-two years old the probability of
promotion was small, and the prospect of marriage remote. His mind
turned to other possibilities. Writing to his cousin Isaac Wood on 10th
November, 1827, he said:</p>

<p>[2-4] "The Governor-General has appointed me his military secretary
but in February I take an expedition into the interior to ascertain the
level of the inland plains and to determine the supposed existence of
an inland sea. This will not be unattended with danger however, it is a
most important trust, and if I succeed, as I anticipate, I shall earn
some credit. The field of professional ambition is closed upon the
soldier during his service in New South Wales though in no case could a
career more honourable than that of discovery have been open to me when
I landed on Australian shores."</p>

<p class="ref">[2-4 Life p.24.]</p>

<p>It seems clear from this evidence that within the first six month of
Sturt's life in New South Wales he had decided that exploration was not
only attractive for its own sake but offered opportunities for gaining
some credit which might prove of material, advantage.</p>

<p>The sequence of events at this period is interesting. Macquarie
encouraged by Colonial Secretary Earl Bathurst, had pushed an active
policy of exploration of the country behind the coastal ranges Oxley,
in 1817, had followed the Lachlan River in its westward and southward
course, and had been stopped by marshes. The following year he had
followed the Macquarie River northward until he was stopped by the
great marsh near Buckinguy and he was confident that, at that point, he
was "in the immediate vicinity of an inland sea, most probably a shoal
one, and gradually decreasing or being filled up by the immense
depositions from the waters flowing into it from the higher lands."
Evans of his party had found the Castlereagh flowing north and
west.</p>

<p>Next was the Hume-Hovell expedition to the south in 1824 during
which were crossed the Murrumbidgee and Murray flowing west, and the
Goulburn flowing north.</p>

<p>Then, in 1827, Cunningham travelled north as far as the Darling
Downs, crossing the Namoi, Gwydir, Macintyre and Dumaresq Rivers, all
flowing toward the centre of the continent.</p>

<p>In view of all this, it is easy to understand that Darling,
reporting to Colonial. Secretary Goderich the return of Cunningham and
the important results of his expedition, should say:5</p>

<p>[2-5] "I would observe that Mr. Cunningham appears desirous to
render the result of his expedition confirmatory of a favourite
hypothesis, the existence of an inland sea. This opinion has lately
become so general from the reports of the natives that I propose, as
soon as the season permits, to endeavour to ascertain the facts."</p>

<p class="ref">[2-5 H.R.A. XIII. 619.]</p>

<p>The date of this despatch was 12th November, 1827. The date of
Sturt's letter to his cousin was 10th November, 1827: the connection is
obvious. But nothing was done at that time.</p>

<p>In May, 1828, Darling received a despatch from London containing a
proposal from a Mr. Ballantyne to land on the west coast of Australia
about 20 degrees south and, using camels, to cross to the settlement on
the east coast. Darling condemned the proposal as not justifying the
expense, difficulty, and hazard, and he added:</p>

<p>[2-6] "I have had it in contemplation for some time past to employ
an officer in this service who has expressed a strong desire to
undertake it: but I have been prevented detaching him by the want of
officers to carry on the duties of the garrison. I entertain the hope,
however, that circumstances will soon permit of my availing myself of
his services."</p>

<p class="ref">[2-6 H.R.A. XIV. 199.]</p>

<p>[2-7]Sturt's "strong desire" was sufficiently obvious to be
mentioned in the official records of the 39th Regiment, where it is
stated that General Darling yielded to the repeated entreaties of
Captain Sturt and permitted him to proceed for the purpose of
prosecuting the discoveries already commenced by other travellers.</p>

<p class="ref">[2-7 Archiv.: S.A. A.663.]</p>

<p>It is hardly surprising that, with exploration and talk of new
country constantly before him, Sturt, too, should have his imagination
excited. It may not have been an unimportant consideration that Oxley,
Hume and Hovell had all been materially rewarded for their
services.</p>

<p>The proposal for an expedition dragged on for twelve months, and
then, although Sturt was not sent to discover an inland sea, or to
follow Ballantyne's proposed route, he was, as Darling advised Sir
George Murray on 19th November, 1828, sent on an expedition to
ascertain the course and fate of the River Macquarie.</p>

<p>[2-8]Darling advised Murray that Sturt, from his scientific
knowledge, appeared to be fully competent to the undertaking and was
"ardently devoted to it." Darling thought there was every chance of
Sturt's success; but, although he had been in the colony for some time,
he had had little opportunity of becoming familiar with the country.
Darling stated that, for this reason, he had attached Mr. Hamilton
Hume, "an experienced traveller," to the expedition.</p>

<p class="ref">[2-8 H.R.A. XIV. 471.]</p>

<p>Sturt's first year in Australia altered his whole life: the change
from the rigid conventions of army and county life to the exciting
freedom of an unknown continent bred in his active mind a complex of
impulses--a love of exploration for its own sake, a desire for the
"credit" it would bring, a search for economic security, although never
any lust for wealth, a fervent devotion to this country, and running
curiously through it all, the lure of the inland sea, an illusive
phantasy nagging at his mind for seventeen years until, by an effort of
will, on the edge of the Simpson Desert, he freed himself from the
illusion and allowed the dream to fade--yet not altogether die, for
there were recurrent flickerings as late as 1854 (see Ch. 10--"Could
this bank have been over any inland waters?"). But through all this was
a dominant motive:</p>

<p>"A wish to contribute to the public good led me to undertake those
journeys which have cost me so much. I should exceedingly regret if it
were thought I had volunteered hazardous and important undertakings for
the love of adventure alone."</p>

<p>His whole life was evidence that this was not vain boasting.</p>

<p>It is of interest to record here the reactions of the civil
officials. The person most interested officially was the
Surveyor-General Oxley. Macquarie had, ten years before,[2-9] described
him as intriguing and discontented. Oxley was one of the party actively
hostile to Darling[2-10] and the latter wrote of him that "he is a very
clever man; but has been too little controlled and I am satisfied will
never submit to the drudgery of carrying on the details of his
department." It is, however, to be noted that Darling followed up this
comment by recommending his brother-in-law for appointment as Deputy
Surveyor-General, as he was desirous of having a person in the
Department who would be some check on the indulgence of any disposition
which might be felt to favour one party or to oppose another. The date
of this letter was 4th September, 1826.</p>

<p class="ref">[2-9 Ellis Macquarie p.494.]</p>

<p class="ref">[2-10 H.R.A. XII. 256, 535.]</p>

<p>But other influences were at work, and T. L. Mitchell was, on 13th
January, 1827, appointed assistant to Mr. Oxley with reversion of the
appointment as Surveyor-General. Mitchell arrived in Sydney on 23rd
September, 1827, and, on Oxley's death on 25th May, 1828, became
Surveyor-General.</p>

<p>It is recorded that Oxley was opposed to private exploring parties,
but there is no record of his attitude towards Sturt.</p>

<p>Mitchell's attitude was soon declared. Sturt wrote to him on 30th
September, 1828, asking his advice about the forthcoming expedition,
particularly as to the route to be followed, adding: "I am endeavouring
to obtain information, but from no one would I rather receive it than
from you."</p>

<p>Mitchell replied on the same day that, as he had clearly understood
from His Majesty's Government that he was likely to be employed on a
journey into the interior, it was not very natural that he should
welcome the employment of another person on a service which had been
considered to belong to the office of his predecessor, but he added:
"to you individually, however, I shall be glad to contribute any
assistance or advice in my power."</p>

<p>It was ten years since Oxley had done his exploring, and those who
had been active in the meantime, Hume and Cunningham, did not belong to
the Survey staff.</p>

<p>Here, however, is the earliest indication of the jealousy that was
to develop, on Mitchell's side, into hostility.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III - The Macquarie Marshes</h2>

<p>From Sturt's letter to Mitchell on 30th September it is clear that
the Governor had by that time decided that Sturt should lead an
expedition into the interior; but actually he left it to Sturt to
submit a plan of operation, and, for this, careful consideration of
alternatives was necessary.</p>

<p>[3-1]Governor King in 1800 had reported that the existence of a sea
or strait running from the Gulf of Carpentaria into the southern ocean
was a very favourite idea in New South Wales; but Flinders had
disproved this by sailing up to the head of Spencer's Gulf.</p>

<p class="ref">[3-1 Wood: Discovery of Australia p.500.]</p>

<p>[3-2]Then Macquarie had sent Oxley to follow the Lachlan River,
hoping he would be able to trace it to the south-west coast of
Australia. However, as already stated, after being baffled by both the
Lachlan and the Macquarie, Oxley definitely favoured the idea of an
inland sea: but, as he presumed that the Lachlan simply faded out by
evaporation and soil absorption, while the Macquarie marshes were on
the edge of the inland sea, it is to be assumed that Oxley's advice, so
far as Sturt might have sought it, would be to concentrate on the area
round the Macquarie River.</p>

<p class="ref">[3-2 Ellis: Macquarie p.493.]</p>

<p>The latest advice available to Darling was that of Cunningham, who
favoured the theory of an inland sea.</p>

<p>But how did Sturt react to all this? In the letter of 30th September
to Mitchell asking his advice, he said:</p>

<p>[3-3] "The Governor has at length allowed me to prepare for the
interior. The Governor appears to favour an expedition to the west of
Wellington Valley to determine whether our interior still lies under
water, and I am inclined to favour it also. I am, however, divided as
to taking a southerly or a northerly course, and it is on this point I
would more particularly desire your advice, for should you favour the
latter, it would be necessary for me to start from Moreton Bay, whereas
the former course would oblige me to follow the Murrumbidgee, which I
think runs parallel to the Macquarie."</p>

<p class="ref">[3-3 Mit. Lib. A.295.17.21.]</p>

<p><b>The Inland Rivers as known in 1828</b></p>
</center>

<p>This is sufficient to indicate the current ignorance of the
geography of the interior. During October Sturt must have received
official advice of his commission to lead an expedition, for, on 4th
November, 1828, he wrote to the Colonial Secretary[3-4] formally
accepting the commission to lead an expedition to determine the fate of
the Macquarie by tracing it as far as possible beyond the point to
which the late Surveyor-General went, and by pushing into the interior
on a westerly course to ascertain if there were any high lands in that
direction; it being supposed the country westward was an unbroken land
and under water. He then went on to discuss his route. In order to
understand his dilemma it is necessary to remember that the fixed idea
at the time was that the Castlereagh and Macquarie Rivers flowed
north-westward into an inland sea. If, therefore, Sturt, starting from
Oxley's last point, were to journey westward he could reasonably expect
to be very soon stopped by extensive marshes or the inland sea
itself.</p>

<p class="ref">[3-4 Sturt Papers.]</p>

<p>Both Darling and Sturt for this reason thought at first that it
would be well to follow up the Macquarie marshes northward along their
eastern rather than the western margin.</p>

<p>What considerations influenced the discussions during October are
not known, but in his letter of acceptance of 4th November Sturt
discussed the possibility of finding an uninterrupted flow of the river
westward and continuing along this into a level and uncertain country
in the interior, his movements being guided by circumstances. But he
had to consider the other alternative: "it may not be prudent to risk
the health of my men by too long a continuance in the swamps and...in
the event of my being unable to penetrate westward I deem it very
probable that I shall make Moreton Bay, if after successive attempts to
turn the marshes I find they still extend to the northward."</p>

<p>It is difficult to-day to imagine such complete ignorance that the
possibility of meeting great marshes or an inland sea anywhere between
Nyngan and Goondiwindi could be contemplated.</p>

<p>As an interesting sidelight on the official discussions there is a
marginal note on this letter written, presumably, by Darling:</p>

<p>"Quite out of the question he would never reach Moreton Bay."</p>

<p>The discussions were finally concluded with an official minute by
Darling (9th November) to Colonial Secretary Macleay directing that
Sturt should endeavour to get round the marshes by the westward, as
nothing whatever was known of that north-west country, and that Sturt
should establish a base to the north of Wellington Valley abandoning
ideas of eastward excursions.</p>

<p>Darling directed that instructions should be prepared and Sturt's
requisition for supplies were approved. As the experience gained on
this expedition very materially influenced Sturt's methods and practice
on his later expeditions, and as there is real interest in examining
the equipment of such an expedition in those early days, the official
instructions issued to Sturt, and the supplies requisitioned by him,
are printed in full as an appendix (Appendix B).</p>

<p>Some aspects of the equipment call for comment; there was no spare
saddle-horse for either Sturt or Hume, no saddle-horses for the men,
only five "breakers" for water, and the clothing must have been of
singularly good quality. It is noted, however, that some alterations
were made in these numbers, as, in addition to two saddle-horses, there
were two for Sturt's own use, and the expedition had seven pack horses
and eight pack bullocks.</p>

<p>As they expected to meet large bodies of water they took a boat "of
the lightest construction," with sprit sail complete, carried on a
light four-wheeled carriage drawn by two bullocks.</p>

<p>It was assumed, correctly, that because of the long drought which
began in 1826 and continued with increasing severity until after the
expedition had returned, that the marshes, by the water-logged
condition of which Oxley had been stopped, would be very much drier and
that the difficulties Oxley had met "would be found to be greatly
diminished, if not altogether removed."</p>

<p>It is necessary here to mention one point. Sturt himself has left on
record that, in respect of longitude observations he was only
self-taught, that he went into the interior to explore, not to survey,
and he admits the possibility of errors in his observations. This has
to be remembered in respect of all his expeditions: there is evidence,
too, of occasional printer's errors in his published works: it is,
therefore, advisable to rely principally upon topographical features in
any identification of places actually visited.</p>

<p>Having received his final instructions on 9th November, Sturt left
Sydney the next day. He followed the old road over the Blue Mountains,
stopping on the way at Dr. Harris' residence (Sheane) and Sir John
Jamieson's place (Regents Ville), overtaking, on the mountains, his men
who had been sent ahead.</p>

<p>The party reached Bathurst on 22nd November, having taken twelve
days from Sydney.</p>

<p>Here Hume joined them and the party was complete: it included
Harris, the faithful servant who had been with him ever since the days
of duty in Ireland, the soldiers Fraser* and Hopkinson, and the
prisoner Clayton--these four were to be with him again on his journey
down the Murray a year later.</p>

<p>(*See Appendix D, Note 1.)</p>

<p>At Wellington Valley an outpost depot had been established in 1826
for the control of bushrangers*; this settlement was on the right bank
of the Bell about two miles above the junction of that stream with the
Macquarie. Sturt had been instructed to complete all his preparations
here with the assistance of the Superintendent, Mr. Maxwell, who was to
supply trained bullocks.)</p>

<p>(* Macquarie had first used the term "bushrangers" to describe
runaway convicts who were ranging the bush; the term did not at first
mean armed robber, though it soon came to have that meaning because of
the methods adopted by the runaway convicts.)</p>

<p>The party left Wellington on 7th December, and moved north along the
eastern bank of the Macquarie, calling at Gobawlin (Gobalyan) and
Dibilamble at the junction of the Tabragar* with the Macquarie.</p>

<p>(* Now spelt Talbragar.)</p>

<p>At Dibilamble they crossed to the western bank of the river to
preserve as much as possible the direct line to Mt. Harris. On their
northward journey they detoured (12th December) to the west to visit
Lake Buddah, finding it abounding in fish, although it had neither
inlet nor outlet: Sturt correctly supposed the fish came in during
floods. Returning to the river they reached the "cataract" somewhere in
the vicinity of what is now known as Rocky Point; here they crossed to
the eastern bank, the local aborigines helping with the handling of
stores. During this crossing the expedition's barometer was broken.</p>

<p>They reached Mt. Harris on 20th December, having passed the site of
the present town of Warren about 16th or 17th December. At Mt. Harris
they found the remains of Oxley's camp, and Sturt indulged in those
very transient gloomy reflections which seemed to have recurred from
time to time on the occasion of each of his expeditions, and he
wondered whether he would succeed or fail.*</p>

<p>(* In his published account of this journey, Sturt states: "Only a
week before I left Sydney I had followed Mr. Oxley to the tomb." But
Oxley died on 26th May.)</p>

<p>After two days at Mt. Harris because of sickness amongst the men,
the party moved to Mt. Foster, where they camped (22nd December): the
camp being, with reasonable probability, about where Travelling Stock
Reserve 27240 is now. Although this was nominally a "base" camp it was,
in practice, very little so used. From here Sturt sent two men back
with despatches and instructions to bring relief supplies to Mt. Harris
to await the return of the main party.</p>

<p>Now began the real business of the expedition--the attack on the
marshes. On 23rd December they moved quietly northwards until they were
stopped by reeds, through which they forced their way back to the
river. Here they were near Buckinguy, probably across the river from
Portion II, Parish of Wundabungay.</p>

<p>The immense lake through which Oxley could not travel was thus, at
this early stage in their journey, found to be: "a large and blasted
plain, on which the sun's rays fell with intense heat." the ground
itself, parched to an extreme degree, showing in many places deep and
dangerous clefts.</p>

<p>The party remained at this camp from 23rd to 26th December. While
the party was stationary, Sturt and Hume rode westwards to the Marra
Creek, passing all the time through reed beds.</p>

<p>On the 26th the party moved a short distance northwards and camped
again amongst the reeds. The site of this camp cannot be identified.
From this camp Sturt, on 26th December, taking two men and a week's
provisions, launched his boat: but after proceeding with very great
difficulty for about eight miles he was completely stopped by reeds in
shallow marshes and had to return to camp at the end of the second day.
It is possible that he was on the Monkeygar Creek. While Sturt was away
with the boat Hume had scouted to the northward and had returned to the
camp with the news that twelve miles to the north he had found a
serpentine sheet of water which he was sure was the channel of the
river; but beyond this was a still more extensive marsh. Sturt then
moved (28th December) the whole camp to this new part of the river.
Here he again launched the boat, but after two miles in a natural
channel the reeds made any further progress by boat quite impossible.
This was the end of all boat excursions, for although they dragged the
boat with them for many days they never again used it.</p>

<p>Hope of water travel on the Macquarie having vanished, Sturt decided
that his only course was to force a land journey to the northern end of
the marshes, and also commence his survey of the western interior.
Examination of all available evidence suggests that they were now on
the Macquarie near Willan, probably Portion 17, Parish of
Wullamgambone.</p>

<p>Sturt and Hume, each with two men, set out on 31st December on
independent reconnaissances: Hume to go northwards along the eastern
side of the marshes and circle round their northern extremity, while
Sturt went in a general north-westerly direction to see what he could
find.</p>

<p>Sturt crossed the Marra Creek south of the Big Lagoon and reached
the Bogan near Cowga, sighting New Year's Range on 1st January. On the
following day he reached and named Oxley's Table Land: from the summit
of the Table Land he saw in the distant south-west the hills which he
named D'Urban's Group. He then returned to the base camp by a route a
little to the east of his outward journey--arriving in camp on 5th
January.</p>

<p>Hume, meanwhile, had started on a north-easterly course, crossing
the Marthaguy and reaching the Merri Creek, which he followed
northward, believing that it would join the Castlereagh; but as it
turned sharply to the west and then back to the north-east (about
fourteen miles north of Carinda) he decided to leave it and go to the
westward. On 3rd January he crossed the Marra Creek probably a little
south of Yarrawin, then, taking up a more south-westerly direction; on
4th January he crossed the Bogan somewhere near Cowga and ascended--and
named--New Year's Range. Hume then returned to camp, arriving one day
after Sturt.</p>

<p>One of Sturt's very rare inaccuracies may be mentioned here.</p>

<p>[3-5] In his <i>Narrative of an Expedition into Central
Australia</i> Sturt said:</p>

<p class="ref">[3-5 Narr. Cent.: 1.15.]</p>

<p>"The New Year's Creek of my first expedition, so called by my friend
Mr. Hamilton Hume, because he crossed it on that day." But this was
written in 1848, and Sturt's memory was at fault, for, whereas Sturt
himself crossed New Year's Creek (the Bogan) on 1st January, Hume did
not cross it until 4th January.</p>

<p>When Sturt and Hume compared notes they found that they had
established that there was a northern limit to the marshes and no
recognisable outlet for the Macquarie River, that, to use Sturt's own
words:</p>

<center>
<p><a name="ill-51a"></a><img alt="" src="0700391h-images/sturt-06.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Routes followed on the First Expedition</b></p>
</center>

<p>"My journey had enabled me to put at rest forever a question of much
previous doubt. Of whatever extent the marshes of the Macquarie might
be, it was evident they were not connected with the Lachlan. I had
gained a knowledge of more than 100 miles of the western interior, and
had ascertained that no sea, indeed that little water, existed on its
surface. Although I had passed over much barren ground, I had likewise
noticed soil that was far from poor. Yet, upon the whole, the space I
traversed is unlikely to become the haunt of civilized man, or will
become so in isolated spots as a chain of connection to a more fertile
country; if a country exist to the westward."</p>

<center>
<p><a name="ill-52"></a><img alt="" src="0700391h-images/sturt-07.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Plan of Beemery "Island" showing point of discovery of River
Darling.</b></p>
</center>

<p>The accuracy of his judgment is notable. A journey to-day anywhere
in the area between Warren, Brewarrina, Bourke and Nyngan bears out, in
every mile, every word of that verdict of the first white man to see
it.</p>

<p>Also, when they compared their respective routes, Sturt and Hume
agreed that their tracks must have been very near each other at the
Bogan River. This left open the remote possibility that the lower
reaches of the Macquarie had been between the two routes and had been
missed by both of them. This was too important a point to be'
undecided, and it was also necessary to gain more information as to the
nature of the "distant interior": their provisions were getting low and
there was no time to lose. They decided to go north along the eastern
side of the marshes and turn west as soon as they could force a way
through the reeds.</p>

<p>The story of this journey in its geographical aspects can quickly be
told. Hume, with the party, moved slowly north and camped on Bulgeraga
Creek, while Sturt made a hurried trip to Mt. Harris hoping to find
that supplies had arrived there.</p>

<p>On the second day Hume took the party along Bulgeraga Creek till
that creek lost itself in the marshes and then continued northwards for
another fifteen miles. This would bring them to a point almost due west
of Quilbone (perhaps about Portion 3 Parish of Molle).</p>

<p>Here Sturt joined them and immediately took the whole party
westwards, forcing their way through the reeds and emerging on to a
vast plain.</p>

<p>Leaving this plain (13th January) they went westward to Marra Creek
(Sturt's Duck Creek) reaching it at about Narrawin, followed it
northerly for seven miles, then turned westward, reaching the Bogan due
east of New Year's Range: just before reaching the Bogan they crossed,
on the same day, both Sturt's and Hume's tracks of the previous
journeys, as they had anticipated. The party camped (17th January) on a
water-hole under New Year's Range. From this camp Sturt and Hume made a
short journey southerly over the claypan to the neighbourhood of Stony
Hills, north-east of Coolabah, returning to the camp the following day
to find one of the men, Norman,* missing.</p>

<p>(*See p. 24.)</p>

<p>From this camp the party moved back to the Bogan to a point where a
bar of red granite crosses the river. The actual point of contact would
be somewhere between Gongolgon and Pink Hills. They followed down the
Bogan to a point almost due east of Oxley's Tableland to which they
moved on 23rd January. Here the main party camped while Sturt and Hume
made a journey to D'Urban's Group. The nature of this group of hills
and of Oxley's Table Land evoked in Sturt's mind the concept of these
ranges being like islands in the midst of the ocean, "only wanting the
sea to lave the base." The inland sea was never far from his mind.</p>

<p>At this point Sturt abandoned all idea of journeys further
westward--the water problem had been acute for days. On his return to
the camp Sturt moved the whole party (31st January) back to the Bogan
to the point where that river turned westward along the course now
known as the "dry Bogan": this course they followed westward, and,
leaving this river bed in a general northerly direction, came suddenly,
on 2nd February, on the great watercourse of the Darling--a "noble
river" the water of which was unhappily salt.</p>

<p>"I found it extremely salt, being apparently a mixture of sea and
fresh water. Whence this arose, whether from local causes, or from a
communication with some inland sea, I knew not, but the discovery was
certainly a blow for which I was not prepared."</p>

<p>The point at which Sturt discovered the Darling can be determined
with reasonable approximation. It is indicated by three features, a
reef of rocks near a considerable loop in the river, a distance of
approximately four or five miles from the Darling--dry Bogan junction,
and Sturt's comment:</p>

<p>"If I might hazard an opinion from appearance, to whatever part of
the interior it leads its source must be far to the northeast or
north."</p>

<p>The rock bar which appears to answer Sturt's description was
probably at a place described in some of the old records as St.
Vincent's Point which was very close to what is now known as Stony
Point--the critical point at which the Darling turns sharply from a set
westerly course to a permanently south-westerly one.</p>

<p>After crossing the "dry" Bogan the route followed by Sturt is shown
in the sketch prepared by Mr. W. K. Glover, of Llandillo Station. This
route accords so closely with the description given by Sturt that it
may be accepted, in view of Mr. Glover's comprehensive knowledge of the
locality, as being reasonably accurate.</p>

<p>Sturt first pitched camp on the Darling at the point where the
Llandillo pumping plant is now located about three miles upstream from
Stoney Point (the point of first contact is about 8 or 9 miles upstream
from Stoney Point): and the point at which Hume found fresh water is,
as shown, approximately two miles south of Stoney Point. In "traversing
a deep bight" the party must have passed very close to Llandillo
homestead, which is located on the sandhill crossed by Hume.</p>

<p>They followed the Darling downstream--passing the site of Bourke
about 4th February--until 9th February, when they turned back, having
reached a point a little south of Redbank.* Before they left this end
point of their journey Hume carved his initials on a tree: these were
seen by Mitchell in 1835 and the place was pointed by Mitchell as 53
degrees E. of S. from D'Urban's Group. At this turning point Sturt
named the river the "Darling": "to pay by this trifling mark of respect
some part of the gratitude I owe to the present Governor of the
Colony."</p>

<p>(* See Appendix, Note. 2.)</p>

<p>They had found the water too salt to drink throughout the whole
course of their journey down the Darling: "I certainly thought we were
rapidly approaching some inland sea": but before they left the Darling
he knew that the saltness was due to springs of salt water in the bed
of the river.</p>

<p>This lack of water was pressing heavily on them--there had been no
rain since they left Mt. Foster--and Sturt felt obliged to return at
once to their base. This they did by their outward route without
incident--except that on 14th February they had to stop to make some
slight repairs to the boat carriage--this boat that was never to be
used. On reaching the western edge of the marshes Sturt and Hume rode
northward to examine the country in that direction, finding that the
reeds gradually disappeared.</p>

<p>On 22nd February they reached camp at. Mt. Harris to find supplies
awaiting them: the Macquarie had wholly ceased to flow and now
consisted of a chain of ponds.</p>

<p>The party remained in camp until 7th March, Sturt completing his
despatches to the Governor.</p>

<p>During this period two short journeys were made.</p>

<p>Hume rode westward more than forty miles, crossing the Marra and the
Bogan. He returned reporting that the country was well watered.</p>

<p>Sturt himself made a short journey round the south-west angle of the
marshes, and going northwards got to the bottom of the first great
marsh (Willan), thus, with all their previous journeys, completing the
circuit of the marshes and replacing mystery by knowledge.</p>

<p>There remained one task--a rapid exploration of the country to the
north of the eastern aspect of the marshes. Sturt records that they
were "determined to make for the Castlereagh agreeably to our
instructions." This is perhaps too liberal an interpretation of
paragraph nine of the instructions (see p. 170), but it was an obvious
objective.</p>

<p>The party left Mt. Harris on 7th Marsh on an E.N.E. course, crossing
the Marthaguy a little south of Gradgery, the Merri just south of Upper
Neinby, and reached the Castlereagh probably between Riverside and
Coonamble. They followed slowly down the Castlereagh from 10th to 29th
March: on the latter date they reached the junction of the Castlereagh
with the Darling. Sturt was quite sure it was the Darling:</p>

<p>"A single glimpse was sufficient to tell us it was the Darling. At a
distance of more than ninety miles nearer its source, this singular
river still preserved its character, so strikingly, that it was
impossible not to have recognized it in a moment."</p>

<p>At this point Sturt had to consider his future movements. He crossed
the Darling and rode north-west, finding nothing but a boundless plain,
nothing to encourage him to proceed. There was still no rain--so he
started on the return to Sydney. Their point of departure was the
junction of the Lower Marthaguy and a creek running northwards from the
Macquarie marshes; about a mile-and--half south of this they crossed
the tracks made by Hume on his first westward journey, which were still
visible.</p>

<p>Working their way southwards, still following the creek bed (which
is named on Sturt's maps "the Macquarie Rivulet") they cut their own
tracks made on the outward journey to the Darling, and thence down the
eastern side of the marshes, reaching Mt. Harris on 7th April. Moving
quietly up the Macquarie they reached Wellington on 21st April after an
absence of four months and two weeks.</p>

<p>This period of four and a half months was one of sheer hard work
unrelieved by any dramatic incident.</p>

<p>One of the men, Norman, was lost in the bush for nearly three days,
being without food or water for the whole period: Sturt set fire to the
cypress and he was thus guided back to camp. The incident was
important, not only in keeping the others from wandering, but in the
effect it had on Sturt's precautions in later expeditions.</p>

<p>For food they were dependent entirely on their own supplies: native
game was absent, even the aborigines had been driven from this
drought-stricken area. As Sturt said:</p>

<p>"How could an European expect to find food in deserts through which
the savage wandered in vain?"</p>

<p>The problem of water supply can be appreciated by anyone who has
been through this country. To take a party of eleven men with eleven
horses and ten bullocks over the country between Warren, Brewarrina,
and Bourke in midsummer, after a three years' drought, with every foot
of the journey unknown country, would test the qualities of any
leader.</p>

<p>"So long had the drought continued, that the vegetable kingdom was
almost annihilated, and minor' vegetation had disappeared: the largest
forest trees were drooping, and many were dead."</p>

<p>They had to rely on surface water rapidly drying up--even the Bogan
was a chain of pools steadily shrinking. Each day water was a recurring
anxiety.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hume and myself wandered over upwards of 600 miles more than
the main body of the expedition in our constant and anxious search for
water."</p>

<p>But, as a good leader, he never left himself without a safe retreat;
and, while on occasion his life line may have been stretched to its
limit, it never broke.</p>

<p>They were greatly troubled with flies "which settled on us in
thousands," and disappeared at sunset: it is the same to-day.</p>

<p>In his encounters with wild aborigines, for Sturt a new experience,
he had the great advantage of Hume's life-long familiarity with native
customs and mental reactions. Around the Macquarie and across the
plains they met few aborigines: with these, patience and a friendly
approach were sufficient. On the Darling the natives were more
numerous.</p>

<p>"The paths of the natives on either side of the river were like
well-trodden roads."</p>

<p>At first these natives, taken by surprise, were hostile and set fire
to the scrub; but again friendly advances were sufficient. These
Darling River natives were suffering from "a violent cutaneous disease
that was sweeping them off in great numbers." When the party was again
on the Darling near the Castlereagh junction more natives were met,
and, again, relations were quite friendly.</p>

<p>From this expedition Sturt formulated the principles governing
contact with wild aborigines.</p>

<p>"The great point is not to alarm their natural timidity; to exercise
patience in your intercourse with them; to treat them kindly; and to
watch them with suspicion, especially at night. Never permit your men
to steal away from the camp, but keep them as compact as possible; and
at every station so arrange your drays and provisions that they may
serve as a defence in case of your being attacked."</p>

<p>While they may not seem much now when the whole of this country can
be covered easily by car, yet, at the time, the results of this
expedition were very important.</p>

<p>For forty years there had been vague speculations as to the nature
of the "interior": these speculations had absorbed an element of
mystery, and even of gloom, by Oxley's discovery of "marshes" as the
fate of two main rivers flowing westward. Even if there were no
suggestions of bunyips, dragons, or other terrors in the swamps, there
was a settled conviction that the interior offered no land for
settlement, no prospect of expansion for the pastoral industry that was
already rapidly developing.</p>

<p>Sturt, in one sweep, cleared away all these clouds of mystery. The
marshes of the Macquarie had been shown to be nothing more than an
ordinary marsh or swamp: true it was large, but it had no influence on
the country to the westward which, so far from being a shallow sea, was
"in itself a table land to all intents and purposes."</p>

<p>The Macquarie was found to continue as a small stream from the north
end of the marshes. More than one hundred miles of new country west of
the Macquarie had been traversed and its nature determined.</p>

<p>The course of all the rivers in that area--the Namoi, Gwydir,
Dumaresq, Castlereagh, Macquarie, and Bogan, and their identity as
tributaries of the Darling, had been decided.</p>

<p>Immediately and inevitably came the question--what happens to the
Lachlan marshes? Is the country to the south of that covered by Sturt
of the same character? What is the course of the Darling below Sturt's
last point of contact?</p>

<p>In his manuscript journal of this 1828 expedition Sturt gives his
opinion on the fate of the Darling:</p>

<p>[3-6] "Considering the advantages that would probably accrue to the
colony should the Darling be found to discharge itself on the South
Coast, it is to be hoped that such expectations will eventually be
realised; but I fear this river traverses a vast extent of country ere
it reaches the sea, if indeed it ever reaches it, for I apprehend that
it is turned by high lands, and the union of many rivers in the
south-east angle of the island from its original course, to the
northward and westward."</p>

<p class="ref">[3-6 Mit. Lib. A.1933.]</p>

<p>Sturt appended a map at the end of this journal showing the
"supposed course of the Darling." After joining with the Murrumbidgee
the river, on this map, turns, just north of 35 degrees S., in a sharp
loop and runs away to the north-west.</p>

<p>Sturt had done more than replace an exciting mystery by commonplace
fact, and, literally, bring the whole matter down to earth; he had
given the people of this young land a new conception of continental
dignity which was the, beginning of a vigorous and healthy national
pride.</p>

<p>And he had done something to himself:</p>

<p>"The Darling River must be considered as the boundary line to all
inland discoveries from the eastward. Any judgment or opinion of the
interior to the westward of that stream would be extremely premature
and uncertain.</p>

<p>"My knowledge of the interior is too limited to justify me in any
conclusion with regard to the central parts of Australia. An ample
field is open to enterprise and to ambition, and it is to be hoped that
some more decisive measures will be carried into effect, both for the
sake of the colony and of geography, to fill up the blank upon the face
of the chart of Australia, and to remove from us the reproach of
indifference and inaction."</p>

<p>He had surrendered himself to that absorbing interest in the
"central parts of Australia," to which he was bound for life. Darling,
in his despatch (24th April, 1829) to the Secretary of State, reporting
the results of this expedition, commended Sturt's leadership and
emphasized the [3-7] "judicious manner and patience and zeal which do
him infinite credit."</p>

<p class="ref">[3-7 H.R.A. XIV. 607, 721.]</p>

<p>This praise was fully justified.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV - The Second Expedition</h2>

<p>Sturt rejoined his regiment in Sydney on 27th April, 1829, but was
restless under the challenge of the still unsolved riddle of the
interior. The records of the 39th Regiment state that he "again most
particularly requested permission to proceed once more for the purpose
of exploring the country in another direction."</p>

<p>Evidently some decision had been taken by September, 1829, for on
17th of that month Sturt wrote to Hamilton Hume a letter of
considerable interest: from this letter it seems that both the Governor
and Sturt hoped that Hume would again go with Sturt. Sturt wrote
indicating his plans:1</p>

<p>[4-1] "I hope my plans will meet your approval: they will lead us
direct to the place you wished to make for from Mount Harris, and
towards your old route. You will see that we must descend the Darling
in boats...as, however, I trust we shall again journey together I will
not here enter into particulars."</p>

<p class="ref">[4-1 Hume: Overland Journey 1824; 1873 Ed.]</p>

<p>It is obvious that speculation as to the interior was still very
confused. While Sturt, realising that its saltness was due to brine
springs in the bed of the river, had given up his idea that the Darling
discharged into an inland ("Mediterranean" he called it) sea, he still
thought it doubtful whether it continued southerly to the ocean or
"turned westerly and ran into the heart of the interior."</p>

<p>[4-2] About this time, however, Darling received information that
there was a "large lagoon in the neighbourhood of St. Vincent's Gulf."*
It is clear that, after the discussions which must certainly have been
held, the Governor decided that Sturt should follow the Murrumbidgee
down to determine whether it terminated in a marsh, as was considered
"not improbable," or united with the Darling, or emptied itself into
the sea on the southern coast of the Colony.</p>

<p class="ref">[4-2 R.G.S.S.A. VIII 49.]</p>

<p>(* This was Lake Alexandrina.)</p>

<p>Should it be found to terminate in a marsh, Sturt was to proceed
overland to the Darling and follow that stream down "as far as
circumstances may render desirable."</p>

<p>The first object was to trace the course of the Murrumbidgee, as, if
that stream should join the Darling, the combination of these two
"considerable rivers" would form a navigable stream opening a direct
and, perhaps, easy communication between Sydney and these distant parts
of the colony: and, if it should be found, as was not improbable, that
the joint stream discharged into the "large lagoon" on the coast there
might be direct communication with the sea, although Darling's
information at that time was that there was no outlet from this lagoon
to St. Vincent's Gulf.</p>

<p>The above represents the substance of Darling's despatch (21st
November, 1829) to Colonial Secretary Murray announcing the departure
of Sturt's second expedition.</p>

<p>The expedition was based on the plan of following the Murrumbidgee
by land as far as practicable, and then launching the boat, continuing
by water until they were stopped: it is reasonably certain that Sturt
did not anticipate that the boat journey would be as long as it proved
to be. The plan of the journey being similar to that of the first
expedition, the arrangements were of the same pattern. Instead,
however, of a light boat, a whale boat, 25 feet long, with a beam of 5
feet, was first built, dismantled, and, during the land journey,
transported in sections.</p>

<p>On this journey more fire arms were taken than on the first
expedition, and a small still was carried, for the distillation of
water in the event of finding the water of the Darling salt as it was
on the previous journey.</p>

<p>Hume did not join the expedition, and the main party consisted
of:</p>

<p>Sturt and George Macleay.<br>
Harris, Hopkinson, Fraser and Clayton, who had all been on the first
expedition.<br>
Two convicts, Mulholland and MacNamee.<br>
And a small supporting land party.</p>

<p>The expedition left Sydney on 3rd November, 1829. Sturt has recorded
the gloomy reflections that seem to have recurred at the outset of each
expedition: but this time transient and not very serious:</p>

<p>"I found myself on that delightful morning leading my horses through
the gates of those barracks whose precincts I might never again enter,
and whose inmates I might never again behold assembled in military
array.</p>

<p>"Yet although the chance of misfortune flashed across my mind, I was
never lighter at heart, or more joyous in spirit:"</p>

<p><b>A.--THE OVERLAND JOURNEY<br>
3rd November to 26th December</b></p>

<p>From Sydney to Gundagai it is possible to follow the expedition's
route in terms of the present Hume Highway. Following on Hume's
overland journey to Port Phillip five years before, settlers had pushed
out with their sheep and had established themselves at Yass, Jugiong,
and as far as Gundagai: 'at least one overland party had taken cattle
into Victoria, crossing the Murrumbidgee at Gundagai. To this point,
therefore, there were primitive tracks to follow--tracks which,
naturally, kept close to water.</p>

<p>Sturt, with his party, followed the present Hume Highway to
Liverpool, the Cross Roads past Carnes Hill to the old Cowpastures
Road, along which they travelled, having the Raby Estate on the right
and Varroville, Sturt's home later, about three miles to their left.
Near Narellan they would have a choice of roads to Macleay's property
at Brownlow Hill in the angle between the Hunter Rivulet and Nepean
River. From Brownlow Hill the track kept to the west of the Hunter
Rivulet, passing through The Oaks village and, crossing the Stonequarry
Creek, entered the present town of Picton from the west just beside the
present bridge.</p>

<p>From Picton the road followed practically the present highway
through Myrtle Creek, Tahmoor, Bargo, to just south of Yerrinbool
where, instead of turning sharply to the right, towards Aylmerton, it
kept straight on over the Mittagong Range, leaving the present town of
Mittagong about one mile to the west and joining the present highway at
Bong Bong. n this section Sturt passed through the property he was
later to own.</p>

<p>From Bong Bong the route was that of the present road through Moss
Vale and Sutton Forest to the Cross Roads. From this point the old road
went south-westwards through the Wombat Brush to the junction of
Paddy's River and the Wollondilly River near the present village of
Canyonleigh.</p>

<p>Thence they followed the valley of the Wollondilly, passing
Lockyersleigh, and the site of Old Towrang on the south bank of the
river, crossing a loop of the river, and camping on the river "under
the bluff end of Cookbundoon" at Murray's Flats.</p>

<p>The next morning, 16th November, they moved up the Wollondilly River
across to the flats known as Mulwaree Ponds between the city of
Goulburn and the War Memorial, and followed these flats along to Dr.
Gibson's property Tirranna--thirteen days from Sydney to Goulburn.</p>

<p>Tirranna is readily identifiable, as the property is still owned by
the Gibson family. From Tirranna, four miles south of Goulburn, the
route was westerly over the hills to near the point where the road to
Canberra leaves the Hume Highway, and from there the track was, for
practical purposes, the same as the present Highway. Sturt comments
on-, the Breadalbane Plains, mentions Redall's farm, and notes
particularly the "large white masses of quartz rock"--still plainly to
be seen to the north of the road.</p>

<p>[4-3] Redall's farm was named Mut-mut-billy--the name still existing
as that of a creek in this region. From these plains the Cullerin Range
was crossed, and, on the other side of this range, they visited J. K.
Hume's* station (Woolowardalla) "on the banks of the Lorn" (Fish
River). Leaving Hume's place they camped on Meadow Creek at Gunning.
Then to Yass, crossing the Mundoonen Range by a pass which, Sturt said:
"is not inappropriately called the Devil's Pass."</p>

<p class="ref">[4-3 A month in the bush of Australia. National Library Pamphlets,
Vol. IX.]</p>

<p>(* Hamilton Hume's brother.)</p>

<p>At Yass they stayed with Mr. Henry O'Brien at his property on what
is now known as O'Brien's Creek and Yass River. After spending a day
quietly there they continued their journey, Mr. O'Brien presenting them
with eight wethers which were to provide them with a welcome change of
diet; and also sending with them an aborigine to guide them to the
Murrumbidgee. Then, passing "a remarkable hill called Pouni" (Mt.
Bowning) they called at the station of Hume's father (Bowning), and
here they left the route of the present highway, turning to the
north-west along the present road to Binalong, intending to visit
Underaliga, a station occupied by Dr. Harris. This Underaliga[4-4] was
almost certainly the place known later as Dunderalligo located near the
position of the present Goondah railway station. This brought them on
to the head of Jugiong Creek, which they followed down to the point at
which the present Hume Highway crosses it by a bridge--which is also
the point at which Jugiong Creek joins the Murrumbidgee. This hill is a
landmark on the journey. Sturt describes it in his usual terse,
accurate way:</p>

<p class="ref">[4-4 Information supplied by the Under-Secretary, Lands Department,
N.S.W.]</p>

<p>"The Murrumbidgee came down to the foot of this little hill from the
south: from the hill on which the hut stands it runs away westward,
almost in a direct line."</p>

<p>The hill is easily identifiable--it rises immediately ahead as the
Jugiong bridge is crossed going south.</p>

<p>They camped in the middle of the Jugiong plain at about the position
of the old cemetery.</p>

<p>This was Sturt's first sight of the Murrumbidgee and his delight at
the contrast between it and the Macquarie was great:</p>

<p>"Instead of a river which had almost ceased to flow I now looked
down upon a stream, whose current it would have been difficult to
breast, and whose waters, foaming among rocks, or circling in eddies,
gave early promise of a reckless course."</p>

<p>They followed the river round the bend past the present township of
Jugiong, turning over the hills by a steep pass on to the plain from
which Cooney's Creek rises. From here, keeping to the east of the
present Hume Highway, they made their way over the undulating country
till they came down into Muttama Creek Valley, which they followed till
they came to where Mingay railway station now stands. From this point
they followed along approximately the present private road to Mingay
homestead. Here at that time a Mr. Warby* had a station: at this place,
which was their last contact with settlement, they stayed that night.
The following day Mr. Warby piloted them to the river at Gundagai,
probably following the present route of the Hume Highway from near
Mingay railway station. Here Sturt had to make a decision. This is the
point at which their route, having, from Sydney, been south-west, and
known, became definitely west and quite unknown.</p>

<p>(* Sturt spells it Whaby.)</p>

<p>Mr. Warby had assured Sturt that he could not take the carts
westward along the river on the north bank because of the rough
country, so Sturt decided to cross to the south bank which looked much
easier. Copying the method Hume had used on his overland journey, Sturt
lashed tarpaulins around the dray body and thus ferried his stores
across. The point of crossing can be fixed with reasonable certainty as
very near to the present railway bridge--actually the cairn which has
been erected there as a monument is very properly located. The date
shown on the cairn is, however, wrong--the date was 28th, not 30th
November.</p>

<p>In view of the prevalence of nettles on these river flats even
to-day, it is of interest to note that, during this crossing,
Mulholland, being naked after swimming the river, was severely stung by
them.</p>

<p>On 29th November they began their journey westward along the south
bank of the river, but had gone only seven miles when the country
became impassable for the drays, while the north bank seemed better: so
they crossed back to the north bank, which they never again left
throughout the rest of the land journey. This crossing was a little to
the east of Nangus--the exact point cannot be determined; the only
direct evidence is that of the Hon. James Gormley, who has
recorded:</p>

<p>[4-5] "When I went to Nangus in 1844 several of the aborigines
pointed out Sturt's place of crossing to me."</p>

<p class="ref">[4-5 R.A.H.S. 11.39.]</p>

<p>For the next two days progress was slow because of rain, but they
managed to travel as far as a "plain which the natives called
Pondebadgery." This was Wantabadgery, where they rested for a day, the
men catching a number of codfish, the largest of which weighed forty
pounds. From Wantabadgery they crossed a range of hills to the
westward--very probably along the route of the present road, as Sturt's
description would fit this route well enough--coming down to a chain of
ponds and serpentine sheet of water. During this day they rose at one
point sufficiently high to obtain an extensive view and took bearings
on "a solitary double hill bearing S.82 degrees W. distant twelve
miles, and another singular elevation that bore S.32 degrees W. called
by the natives Kengal." There has been considerable speculation as to
the identity of these two peaks; but there can be no certainty.</p>

<p>It seems probable that "the singular elevation" is The Rock, but if
this is so it is difficult to identify the point from which the compass
bearing was taken. It may be noted that this name [4-6] "Kengal"
appears as the name of one of the eminences sighted by Sturt from
D'Urban's Group on his previous expedition. The day after these
observations had been taken they entered a forest consisting of
box-trees, casuarinae, and cypresses on a light, sandy soil, in which
both horses and bullocks sank so deep that their labour was greatly
increased.</p>

<p class="ref">[4-6 Two Exp. 1.212.]</p>

<p>The combination of a serpentine sheet of water and loose sandy soil
suggests that they came down from the vicinity of Oura on the 5th
December, reaching the sandy flats of Wagga Wagga on that or the
following day. If this be so, there is an error or misprint in the
compass bearings. The point is not of great importance.</p>

<p>As they proceeded down the river the country became much
flatter--they ascended a granite hill (Mt. Arthur) from which they
identified a "double hill bearing S.10 degrees W." which was Mt.
Galore.</p>

<p>Sturt continued his journey westward, noting the sandhills [4-7]
near Berembed Weir, ascending an "inconsiderable elevation"
(Bundidgerry Hill), reaching the site of Narrandera on 10th December,
and on 11th December "the country on the opposite side of the river had
all the features of that to the north of it, but a plain of such extent
suddenly opened upon us to the southward, that I halted at once in
order to examine it."</p>

<p class="ref">[4-7 The author is indebted to Mr. H. B. Rowlands, of Narrandera,
for information concerning the section between Mt. Arthur and
Narrandera.]</p>

<p>Sturt called this plain "Hamilton's Plains," but that name has been
forgotten. The plain is that which is crossed by Yanco Creek, and the
spot at which Sturt made his camp on 11th December is on, or very near,
Portion 8 Parish of Cudgel, this being the only place at which this
plain comes close to the south bank for about half-a-mile: elsewhere
the edge of the plain is some considerable distance from the river.
This is, on an air-line, between six and seven miles west of
Narrandera. Having examined this plain on 12th December they continued
their westward journey on 13th December. They had passed all high lands
and the interior to the westward presented an unbroken level to the
eye. Still low ranges continued to their right and the cypress ridges
became more frequent and denser. Now began a fortnight of weary toil.
Some extracts from Sturt's own account will give the picture:</p>

<p>"Our route during the day was over as melancholy a tract as ever was
travelled. The plains to the north and north-west bounded the
horizon--not a tree of any kind was visible upon them. It was equally
open to the south, and it appeared as if the river was decoying us into
a desert, there to leave us in difficulty and in distress. It is
impossible for me to describe the kind of country we were now
traversing, or the dreariness of the view it presented.</p>

<p>"Neither beast nor bird inhabited these lonely and inhospitable
regions, over which the silence of the grave seemed to reign. We
started on the 23rd with the same boundlessness of plain on either side
of us, but in the course of the morning we got upon a light, tenacious
and blistered soil. The drays and animals sank so deep in this, that we
were obliged to make for the river, and keep upon its immediate
banks."</p>

<p>On 24th and 25th December they had the same difficulties, struggling
over light rotten soil and through fields of polygonum junceum. They
had not, for days past, seen a blade of grass.</p>

<p>On 25th December, Sturt, with Macleay, rode northwards to the
Lachlan, crossed it, and examined the country to the north of it.* He
decided, correctly, that he had arrived at the junction of the Lachlan
with the Murrumbidgee, and he held the first key to the solution of the
riddle of the rivers.</p>

<p>(* The aborigines, in 1836, told Mitchell of this visit of Sturt to,
and across, the Lachlan.)</p>

<p>The exact point of his contact with the Lachlan is indefinite, but
is unimportant. The next day, 26th December, brought the necessity for
a critical decision:</p>

<p>"On the 26th we traversed plains of the same wearisome description.
The wheels of the drays sank up to their axle-trees, and the horses
above their fetlocks at every step. In several instances, the force of
both teams was put to one dray, to extricate it from the bed into which
it had sunk. I was checked in my advance by high reeds spreading as far
as the eye can reach, under which the soil is so soft that the drays
stuck fast and the cattle knocked up."</p>

<p>They had wandered a little north, away from the river, and had got
into the Lachlan marshes--the sponge-like delta into which the Lachlan
fans out before seeping its way into the Murrumbidgee.</p>

<p>Here was the Macquarie puzzle all over again, recognized at once by
Harris, Fraser, Hopkinson and Clayton as an unwelcome event.</p>

<p>Sturt sent Macleay scouting forward, and, on hearing that the reeds
stretched as far as Macleay could see, the party turned south and
camped on the Murrumbidgee banks.</p>

<p><b>The Locality of the Depot on the Murrumbidgee.</b></p>
</center>

<p>Next morning Sturt pushed through the reeds until he could see the
open country on the other side, country of a nature similar to that
over which they had been travelling for days. There was need for an
immediate decision. His instructions were that, if the Murrumbidgee
ended in a marsh, he was to go straight across country to regain the
Darling.</p>

<p>But did these reed-beds represent the end of the Murrumbidgee?</p>

<p>He had already identified, at least provisionally, the Lachlan, and
would be justified in assuming that these reed-beds were of the
Lachlan, rather than of the Murrumbidgee.</p>

<p>He could have settled the point by scouting around the reed-beds as
he had done on the Macquarie. Actually he did this: he and Macleay rode
along the Murrumbidgee banks for some miles. He found that river still
deep, its current still rapid, and its banks still high--the whole
picture quite different from the flat marshes of the Macquarie.
Moreover he was now at least one hundred miles west of all known river
courses, including his own first contact with the Darling. He felt
convinced from all the evidence that the Murrumbidgee would continue as
a river. He had vague information from the local aborigines near
Narrandera that there was another stream to the south "to which the
Murrumbidgee was but a creek, and that we could gain it in four
days."</p>

<p>He had the Darling to the north flowing south-west, the Murray to
the south flowing west, and he was on a river flowing strongly to the
west, he had good reason for presuming that they must all
converge--and, possibly, meet at some point. He could have decided the
issue by keeping on with the journey by land, but the nature of the
country and the wearied state of his cattle induced his decision to
launch the boat and continue the journey by water. When this decision
was made, and the party was in camp assembling the boat, he wrote
despatches, and also a friendly letter to Hamilton Hume (4th January,
1830) telling him of the dilemma, and of his decision:</p>

<p>[4-8] "Where I shall wander to God only knows. I have little doubt,
however, that I shall ultimately make the coast."</p>

<p class="ref">[4-8 Life p.58; Hume Overland Journey 1824.]</p>

<p>The party was in camp from 26th December, 1829, to 6th January,
1830, assembling the boat they had hauled from Sydney; and, as this was
not large enough to hold all their stores, they felled a local tree and
built a small skiff.</p>

<p>There has been much examination of evidence, and considerable
speculation concerning the location of this depot, as Sturt called his
camp. In his own printed account Sturt gives its position as either
twelve or fifteen miles (he gives both figures) above the point where
the Lachlan joins the Murrumbidgee. As it is not even possible to
identify, with any certainty, the point which Sturt would have accepted
as this point of junction, the site of the depot must remain always
uncertain.</p>

<p>[4-9] Following the windings of the river twelve miles would be
about Portion 42, Parish of Toopuntul. n the other hand topographical
features suggest a position near to Travelling Stock Reserve 41069. It
would be not unreasonable to say that the "depot" was somewhere near
this Travelling Stock Reserve: but it would be unreasonable, on any
present evidence, to be more definite. This position is about sixteen
miles west of Maude on an air-line.</p>

<p class="ref">[4-9 Valuable advice has been given by the Under-Secretary, Lands
Department, N.S.W., and Mr. R. B. Ronald, of Nap Nap Station.]</p>

<p><b>B.--DOWN THE RIVERS TO THE SEA<br>
7th January to 11th February, 1830</b></p>

<p>All preparations having been completed by 6th January, Sturt
selected his party (whose names have been given above), gave
instructions to the supporting party, under the control of Robert
Harris, to remain at the depot for one week and then return to
Goulburn. They killed the last remaining sheep and everything was ready
by the evening of the 6th January.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 7th January they said farewell to the
returning party and "embarked on the bosom of that stream along the
banks of which we had journeyed for so many miles--whether ever to
return being a point of the greatest uncertainty."</p>

<p>From the 7th to the 14th January they were travelling down the
Murrumbidgee. After passing the presumed mouth of the Lachlan the skiff
was holed by striking a sunken log and immediately sank. Some hours
were spent in recovering the articles which had been thrown out as the
skiff sank: but the worst damage was the mixing of fresh water with the
brine in the casks of meat: this was to affect their food supply to a
serious degree.</p>

</center>

<p>They passed and noted the stream near Balranald connecting with the
Yanga Lake. During the last days of this week on the Murrumbidgee the
river was contracting, its banks were not so high; and Sturt began to
worry that it was going to be a case of the Macquarie and marshes all
over again. On 12th and 13th January the channel became increasingly
blocked by trees which had been swept down by floods, and whose
branches frequently interlocked making passage by the boat very
difficult. On the 14th January there was a dramatic change:</p>

<p>"On a sudden, the river took a general southern direction, but, in
its tortuous course, swept round to every point of the compass with the
greatest irregularity. We were carried at a fearful rate down its
gloomy and contracted banks. At 3 p.m. Hopkinson called out that we
were approaching a junction, and in less than a minute afterwards we
were hurried into a broad and noble river."</p>

<p>They had reached the Murray, and Sturt now held the second key to
the riddle of the rivers: the ring was closing fast--the upper Darling,
Macquarie, Lachlan, Murrumbidgee, and now the Murray--no longer
mysteries, but very unromantic realities.</p>

<p>Sturt was happy; his deductions were being proved, his decision to
launch the boats was justified, and they were on a navigable stream,
the "high road" either to the south coast or to some important
outlet.</p>

<p>From 14th to 21st January they continued down the Murray without
incident; Sturt noting that at every creek junction there was an
extensive sandbank.</p>

<p>On the 19th January, after having been through a critical meeting
with a large tribe of natives, which ended in friendly relations, one
man "remarkable for personal strength and stature (see Ch 4: '...who
proved to be the remarkable savage I have previously noticed.') showed
especially friendly attentions."</p>

<p>About 21st January, in the Redcliffs region, the banks suddenly
acquired a perpendicular and waterworn appearance.</p>

<p>On 22nd January, they had great difficulties in the rapids of the
Merbein rocks, but got through without damage--the natives watching the
proceedings from the banks: then round the Cowanna Bend which Sturt
noted.</p>

<p>The party, therefore, passed the site of Mildura on 22nd
January.</p>

<p>At this stage the northward trend of the river was puzzling
Sturt.</p>

<p>On 23rd January, with a wide river and a fair wind, they hoisted the
sail for the first time, and were travelling quickly when, without
warning, they saw, ahead, a long sandspit projecting into the river
crowded with natives showing every sign of hostility. Just as it seemed
probable the party would slip past without trouble, the boat ran
aground on the sandbank. The natives crowded up, becoming more excited,
and sharp fight at very close quarters was inevitable. At the climax of
the tension the "remarkable man" whom they had met on the 19th January
appeared on the southern bank, jumped into the river, swam over to the
sandbank, and rushing to the foremost native "seizing him by the
throat, he pushed him backwards and, forcing all who were in the water
upon the bank, he trod its margin with a vehemence and an agitation
that were exceedingly striking."</p>

<p>Gradually the natives became quiet. This crisis over, the boat was
pushed into deeper water, and, behind the sandspit was a new and
beautiful stream, coming apparently from the north. Up this stream they
rowed for some miles, then, hoisting the Union Jack and giving three
cheers, they sailed again down to the junction. Sturt was satisfied
that he was on the Darling "from whose banks I had been twice forced to
retire."</p>

<p>Sturt now held the third key to the riddle of the rivers, and the
ring was complete, except for the section of the Darling, south of
Redbank, from the point where Sturt had left it in 1829. Until this
section had been actually travelled (which was not until 1844) there
could be no final certainty that this new stream was actually the
Darling.</p>

<p>At this junction Sturt named the main stream the Murray River, in
honour of Sir George Murray, the Secretary of State for the Colonies:
He intended the name to apply to the stream after its junction with the
Murrumbidgee, preserving the names already given to the various streams
which combined to form the main river. Had this intention been observed
the river would have been the "Hume" as far as the Murrumbidgee
junction, and the "Murray" below that.</p>

<p>However, by common use, the stream is now known as the Murray
throughout, although the map of New South Wales published by the Lands
Department of that State in 1933, gives the name of the river as
"Murray or Hume River."</p>

<p>There is an ironical aspect about this naming. Sturt named the river
the "Murray" in accord with Darling's known wishes, but also because of
Sturt's own admiration for Murray as a soldier. But it is recorded of
Murray by his subordinates that, as Secretary of State, they had never
met with any public officer so totally inefficient.[4-10]</p>

<p class="ref">[4-10 Mills: The Colonization of Australia, p.10.]</p>

<p>In his published account of this expedition Sturt states that he
placed the junction of these streams at longitude 140&deg; 56' East;
but as there is some definite evidence that he did not take any
observations on the spot at the time, it seems probable that this
longitude was arrived at by calculation later.</p>

<p>The point has some interest in view of the fact that the eastern
boundary of the new province of South Australia was fixed at 141&deg;
East.</p>

<p>For further discussion of this point, see Appendix D, Note 3.</p>

<p>Before leaving their camp at the Darling junction they had burnt the
skiff, and cut the still into copper crescents as presents for the
natives.</p>

<p>From 23rd January, when they left the mouth of the Darling at
Wentworth, until 8th February, when they passed Murray Bridge, their
journey was comparatively uneventful.</p>

<p>On 24th January they passed without trouble the Cadell Rocks below
Wentworth. On 26th they passed the outlet stream connecting Lake
Victoria with the Murray, and Sturt named it the Rufus River, after
Macleay's red head.</p>

<p>Next day, 27th, they saw, and named, the Lindesay River after the
Colonel commanding Sturt's own (39th) Regiment: and on 28th they had
passed the border between Victoria and South Australia--near Tareena.
Sturt described the cliffs in this region: "singular in character, and
varied in form: they had the most beautiful columnar regularity: they
showed like falls of muddy water that had suddenly been petrified."</p>

<p>On 29th the sharp bend to the southward, in the neighbourhood of
Renmark and Berri, gave Sturt great satisfaction: but this was tempered
by the beginning of anxiety about the men: their salt meat had been
spoiled as already told, they would not eat the river fish which
"without sauce or butter is insipid enough," and wildfowl or land game
was not easily obtained: the men had little else than flour to eat, and
were showing signs of fatigue.</p>

<p>On 30th January they were between Loxton and Pyap and here Sturt
noted the beginning of the fossil formation which was to become so
distinctive a feature of the river in its lower reaches. At about nine
miles from its commencement, where it was only about a foot high, this
fossil bank rose to a height of more than 150 feet.</p>

<p>By the end of the day on 31st January they had reached Overland
Corner, and, on 3rd February, had turned the North-west Bend at Morgan,
having shortly before been told by an old native that the river would
soon turn southward to the sea.</p>

<p>On 4th February they had seen some seagulls, and on this day also
they were again joined by the old native who, at Morgan, had told them
of the change in the direction of the river.</p>

<p>On 6th February they were told by some natives that they were not
far from the sea.</p>

<p>Continuing their journey steadily they camped in the neighbourhood
of Murray Bridge on 8th February.</p>

<p>On the morning of 9th February they proceeded down the river. At a
turn of the stream a solitary rock of coarse red granite rose above the
waters, and formed an island in its centre.</p>

<p>"After pulling a mile or two, we found a clear horizon to the south,
I, consequently, landed to survey the country. I still retained a
strong impression in my mind that some change was at hand, and, on this
occasion, I was not disappointed; but the view was one for which I was
not altogether prepared. We had, at length, arrived at the termination
of the Murray. Immediately below me was a beautiful lake, which
appeared to be a fitting reservoir for the noble stream which led us to
it. Even while gazing on this fine scene I could not but regret that
the Murray had thus terminated; for I immediately foresaw that, in all
probability, we should be disappointed in finding any practicable
communication between the lake and the ocean, as it was evident that
the former was not much influenced by tides."</p>

<p>They camped on the night of 9th February on the eastern side of the
outlet of the Murray into the lake; and, on the 10th, sailed with a
fair wind to the north shore of Hindmarsh Island, where they
camped--the sound of the surf coming gratefully to their ears, for it
told them they were near the goal they had so long been seeking, and
they promised themselves: "a view of the boundless ocean on the
morrow."</p>

<p>This seems to throw some doubt on the literal accuracy of the
inscription on the monument on Hindmarsh Island:</p>

<p>"Hereabouts, in February, 1830, Sturt first saw the waters of
Encounter Bay."</p>

<p>It was next day, 11th February, that, having reached a spot near the
Goolwa Barrage after a fatiguing day of hauling the boat over mud
shoals, they finally ended their long boat journey, and walked across
the sandhills to the sea. There remained for Sturt only one more
task--to determine the ultimate fate of the great body of water that
came down the Murray: how did it reach the sea?</p>

<p>The photograph showing the islands in the lake shows clearly the
problem facing Sturt. Next morning this was settled. On 12th February
Sturt, Macleay, and Fraser walked along the long western promontory to
the outlet from the lake to the sea.</p>

<p>Here was the last key, and the riddle of the rivers was a riddle no
longer. The nature of the country in New South Wales from the coast to
the Darling either was known, or could be assumed with reasonable
certainty: and the fate of all the inland rivers was established, with
a possible reservation about the unknown section of the Darling.</p>

<p><b>THE RETURN JOURNEY<br>
12th February to 25th May</b></p>

<p>Now Sturt had to face the long journey back. His men were very weak,
his food supplies were low, he could not count on a relief ship, and
there was nothing to be gained by landing and going overland to St.
Vincent's Gulf; the men were too weak and the chance of being seen by a
vessel were too remote.* There was no alternative to the long pull
back: the natives around the lake were very hostile, and they must go
without delay. They had taken 36 days on the downstream journey, they
must expect a longer journey pulling upstream: they had reason for
thinking that the natives might be more hostile than they had been on
the downstream journey; indeed they found this expected hostility.</p>

<p>(* See Appendix D, Note 4.)</p>

<p>The homeward journey began as soon as Sturt had returned on the
morning of 12th February. Before leaving, Sturt buried a bottle
containing a record of their visit: this bottle has never been found:
also before leaving, Sturt named the lake "Lake Alexandrina" after the
young heiress to the throne. After she became Queen Victoria, Sturt
would have had the name changed to Lake Victoria, but this was never
adopted*; in Sturt's Narrative of an Expedition into Central Australia,
however, he speaks of this lake as Lake Victoria although in other
places he uses this name properly for the Lake Victoria which is an
overflow from the Murray west of the Darling in New South Wales.</p>

<p>* [4-11] On 15th March, 1843, Sturt wrote to Lord Stanley proposing
that the name be changed to "Lake Victoria." On 15th August, 1843,
Stanley advised Grey that Sturt was free to change the name if he
wished.</p>

<p class="ref">[4-11 Public Records Office, London; 1415 South Australia.]</p>

<p>At starting on the 12th February they were fortunate in having a
favourable wind, which lasted until 17th February, carrying them
without any pulling, across the lake and up the river as far as Swan
Reach, travelling up-stream in five days the distance which had taken
seven days coming down.</p>

<p>From there, however, it was steady pulling without any relief. Sturt
and Macleay both took turns at the oars, and the men became
progressively weaker. For fifty-three days this journey continued.</p>

<p>When the wind failed, and the endless pulling had to be faced, they
cleaned the boat and then started. From dawn till seven or even nine,
o'clock in the evening with an hour for their flour and water lunch,
was the daily programme. Occasionally a wild duck or a few fish
relieved their monotonous diet. The small amount of sugar had ended on
the 17th February, and by 8th March the small residue of salted
provisions had also gone.</p>

<p>They reached Morgan on 21st February and, the course now being
eastward, the men felt that, at least, they were headed homeward.</p>

<p>On 4th March they passed the mouth of the Darling, their
apprehension of renewed trouble with the natives here being unfounded,
as the locality was totally deserted. On 16th March they returned to
the Murrumbidgee: "to our great joy we turned our boat into the gloomy
and narrow channel."</p>

<p>They were troubled in the Murrumbidgee, having difficulty with the
short bends cluttered up with fallen timber. They tried poles instead
of oars, without success. But here they shot a swan which gave them all
a good meal. On 23rd March they reached the depot from which they had
launched their boats: there was nothing, it was entirely deserted. The
men, who had been expecting relief supplies were gravely depressed--and
the hope of relief which had kept them going to this point vanished.
Now began the last gruelling section of their long journey.</p>

<p>The intricate navigation of the Murrumbidgee had been infinitely
more distressing than the hard pulling up the open reaches of the
Murray, for they were obliged to haul the boat up between numberless
trunks of trees, an operation that exhausted the men much more than
rowing: the river had fallen below its former level and rocks and logs
were now exposed above the water.</p>

<p>To make things even worse as they toiled upstream from the depot the
flood water came down, the river rising six feet in one night. For
seventeen days from the depot they endured this ordeal, the men passing
even beyond the limits of endurance, but never complaining; until, on
11th April they reached their old camp opposite Hamilton's Plains
(Narrandera) and here they stopped.</p>

<p>Their provisions were nearly finished, and would have been
altogether so if they had not been so fortunate as to kill several
swans.</p>

<p>Sturt decided to abandon the boat and finish the journey on land:
but as the provisions were so short, and the men so weak, he sent
Hopkinson and Mulholland forward on foot to Wantabadgery, believing
that Robert Harris would be there with relief supplies.</p>

<p>In the meantime the rest of the party remained in camp. The two men
left on 12th April and returned on the 18th April. In camp the last
ounce of flour had been served out and all preparations made for a
desperate forward move by the main party. The two men, however, had
returned with supplies and Sturt's worries were ended. These two men
had gone eastward 90 miles on foot, in three days; and had returned
over' the same distance with bullock drays in four days. This,
considering the extremely exhausted condition of the men before they
started, was a remarkable example of endurance.</p>

<p>"They were both of them in a state which beggars description. Their
knees and ankles were dreadfully swollen and their limbs so painful,
that as soon as they arrived in camp they sank under their efforts, but
they met us with smiling countenances, and expressed their satisfaction
at having arrived so seasonably to our relief."</p>

<p>Sturt was thus able to save all his equipment and records, most of
which he had arranged to bury before they started out on foot: the
whole party left camp on 20th April, reaching Wantabadgery on 28th.
Sturt had sent Macleay forward on 20th April, from their Narrandera
camp with despatches for the Governor. The main party left Wantabadgery
on 5th May, passing through Yass on 12th, and, travelling easily,
reached Sydney on 25th May.</p>

<p><b>D--RESULTS OF THE EXPEDITION</b></p>

<p>The story which has been told in this chapter is that of a journey
remarkable in itself, and notable for its place in the development of
Australia.</p>

<p>Sturt had now revealed himself as a great leader: two difficult
expeditions had been completed with conspicuous success and without
accident. That four of the men who had been five months with him under
the difficult conditions of his first expedition should willingly join
him on the second is evidence which needs no comment. Hume could not,
because of other commitments, join in this expedition, but there is
evidence enough that, for both Hume and Macleay, the friendship which
Sturt formed during these expeditions was never afterwards lessened or
broken.</p>

<p>Eight men confined in a boat only 25ft long all day, every day, for
95 days require something more than normal human relations: leadership
of unusual quality is essential. This leadership Sturt, greatly helped
by Macleay, gave them. The last seventeen days of the boat journey, 150
miles by land but far more by water, was a nightmare for men starved of
food as to quantity, and weakened by the scurvy-inducing quality of
what food they had. All were desperate, Macnamee, at the end,
temporarily insane.</p>

<p>"Their arms appeared to be nerveless; their faces became haggard,
their persons emaciated, their spirits wholly sunk; nature was so
completely overcome, that from mere exhaustion they frequently fell
asleep during their painful and almost ceaseless exertions."</p>

<p>Yet Sturt could assure the Governor officially that during the whole
of the journey the men were cheerful, zealous, and obedient:</p>

<p>The quality of the leadership which gave such results cannot be
doubted.</p>

<p>Sturt had now shown that meticulous care for detail which marked all
his work. Day after day down the rivers he charted every bend with the
compass bearing and approximate length of every reach: the successive
sheets of this chart still exist, and their accuracy is extraordinary.
He had already shown on the first expedition an unusual capacity for
forming reliable deductions based on the nature of the country over
which he travelled. This quality was again evident: He had noted that,
while the Murray itself was navigable, its sea-mouth was not, the
onshore wind in Encounter Bay and the surf on the bar making any
seaport impossible: he had noted the long arm of Lake Alexandrina
leading into Currency Creek and regretted that he was not able to
explore the possibility of this being a connection with St. Vincent's
Gulf.</p>

<p>He had noted with quick and appreciative eye the possibilities of
the Murray Valley near its mouth:</p>

<p>"It contains land that is of the very richest kind--soil that is the
pure accumulation of vegetable matter, and is black as ebony. If its
hundreds of thousands of acres were practically available, I should not
hesitate to pronounce it one of the richest spots of equal extent on
earth, and highly favoured in other respects. It is, however, certain
that any part of the valley would require much labour before it could
be brought under cultivation."</p>

<p>He had noted and recorded the change from the black soil plains, to
the high red cliffs, and then to the fossil beds emerging from the
water level and rising to cliffs 150 feet high of solid fossil
accumulation. He concluded that a current of water must have swept this
vast accumulation of shells from the extreme north of the continent,
that they must have been at first under water and been raised by some
upheaval and:</p>

<p>"I am brought to conclude that in former times the sea washed the
western base of the dividing range...and when the mass of land, now
lying waste and unproductive, became exposed, the rivers, which until
then had pursued a regular course to the ocean, having no channel
beyond their original termination, overflowed the almost level country
into which they now fall; or, filling some extensive concavity, have
contributed, by successive depositions, to the formation of those
marshes of which so much has been said."</p>

<p>These conclusions were not the result of any casual observation or
superficial reasoning: they were not far from the truth. In summing up
the results of the expedition Sturt stated, overmodestly, that the
expedition had returned to Sydney without any splendid discovery to
gild its proceedings; and that the labours and dangers it had
encountered were considered as nothing more than ordinary occurrences.
He felt disappointed that his researches had not benefitted the Colony,
as he had found only a barren tract of country to the westward: he
felt, however, that from a geographical point of view nothing could
have been more satisfactory than the results of the expedition,
excepting a knowledge of the country to the northward between the
Murray and the Darling.</p>

<p>Macleay reached Sydney at some date before 6th May. Governor Darling
caused a notice in the form of a Government Order* dated 10th May,
1830, to be published in the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>. This notice, after
stating concisely the results of the expedition, adds:</p>

<p>"Thus has Captain Sturt added largely, and in a highly important
degree, to the knowledge previously possessed of the interior."</p>

<p>(* This Order contains a curious mistake: it states that Sturt took
twenty-one days from leaving Sydney to launching his boats; actually he
took fifty-eight days. It is also to be noted that in this Order, the
modern spelling of Murrumbidgee is used, whereas Sturt, in his story,
published three years later, speaks of it always as the
"Morumbidgee.")</p>

<p>"The opportunity of recording a second time the services rendered to
the Colony by Captain Sturt, is as gratifying to the Government which
directed the undertaking, as it is creditable to the individual who so
successfully conducted it to its termination.</p>

<p>"It is an additional cause of satisfaction to find that everyone,
according to his sphere of action, has a claim to a proportionate
degree of applause. All were exposed alike to the same privations, and
fatigue, and everyone submitted with patience, manifesting the most
anxious desire for the success of the expedition."</p>

<p>This order appeared fifteen days before Sturt himself arrived in
Sydney.</p>

<p>The date of this public tribute locally was 10th May, 1830: but it
was not until 17th February, 1831, that Darling sent official advice to
London. Even then it was brief and stated that, as Sturt had been sent,
immediately after his return, to Norfolk Island, Darling had not been
able to transmit a complete report of the expedition. The despatch ends
on this curious note:</p>

<p>[4-12] "If interested in this matter, you will find a sketch of his
operations in a Government Order in the enclosed Gazette, and I shall
be glad to find that the result is satisfactory to you."</p>

<p class="ref">[4-12 H.R.A. XVI. 89.]</p>

<p>[4-13] Darling followed this with a longer despatch, dated 14th
April, 1831, forwarding Sturt's own report on the expedition. In this
despatch he explained that the transmission of the report had been
delayed as Sturt, thinking that the original report had not been
prepared with the accuracy which was necessary for submission to His
Majesty's Government, had wished to revise and correct it. He had,
however, been too exhausted before being sent to Norfolk Island to
undertake this revision.</p>

<p class="ref">[4-13 H.R.A. XVI. 242.]</p>

<p><b>The Inland Rivers as known in 1830.</b></p>
</center>

<p>Darling warmly commended Sturt's qualities and leadership and
concluded his despatch:</p>

<p>"I beg respectfully to express my hope that His Majesty's Government
will consider that his zeal and the important services he has rendered
give him a just claim to promotion. It has been as well merited in the
present instance as it could have been on any occasion, and such a mark
of favour would not only be gratefully appreciated by the individual in
question, but would act as a stimulus to rouse others to exertion."</p>

<p>Before this official recognition, however, had come unofficial
public recognition as soon as George Macleay had arrived in Sydney.</p>

<p>On 6th May the <i>Sydney Gazette</i> after recording the results of
the expedition, added this tribute:</p>

<p>"Captain Sturt has inscribed his name in indelible characters upon
the records of our history, and will occupy a respectable rank among
those heroic men to whom the world is indebted for geographical
knowledge."</p>

<p>Beyond the actual geographical results of Sturt's two expeditions,
there had been other, intangible, consequences.</p>

<p>When Sturt arrived in Sydney he came to a community of prisoners,
not prisoners at law, but prisoners of circumstance, geographical and
social prisoners in a limited territory within which a small oligarchy
had assumed the rights of "eminent domain," and had pre-empted all the
valuable land.</p>

<p>The harpings of Oxley and Cunningham on "impenetrable marshes" and
"inland seas" had discouraged individual enterprise and expansion.</p>

<p>Within three years of his arrival, and within twelve months of
concentrated activity, Sturt had substituted reality for mystery, had
brought precious water, rivers, navigable waterways, and land--land
unowned, land for the taking, land! It was not "land," it was an
empire, beyond even the appetite of the oligarchs.</p>

<p>In replacing a narrow coastal complex by a continental consciousness
Sturt had shattered the horizon--all horizons--and the task in which
Bligh, Macquarie, Darling had each, in turn, been only partially
successful, had been by him almost completed. He had brought freedom,
freedom de facto if not yet de jure or de lege, freedom of action,
freedom of movement, freedom of opportunity, and the prospect of
freedom from oligarchs.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that a traveller, visiting these parts just two
years after Sturt's journey, recorded that nine stations had been taken
up covering forty-eight miles downstream from Warby's at Gundagai. (See
Appendix D, Note 5.)</p>

<p>But his very success excited hostility, especially from
Surveyor-General Mitchell; the effects of this hostility will appear
later.</p>

<p>Sturt had, at this time, and always, a firm, and completely sincere
faith in God:</p>

<p>"Something more powerful than human foresight or prudence appeared
to avert the calamities and dangers with which I and my companions were
so frequently threatened; and had it not been for the guidance and
protection we received from the Providence of that good and all-wise
Being to whose care we committed ourselves, we should, ere this, have
ceased to rank among the number of His earthly creatures."</p>

<p>Prudence and Providence--God and my own right arm.</p>

<p><b>E--EXPERIENCES WITH ABORIGINES</b></p>

<p>The story of Sturt's second expedition would not be complete without
some account of his encounters with the aborigines. It is impossible,
within the limits of this work to give the story in full detail: for
this, Sturt's own original account must be consulted. As he was the
first European to see, and record information about the aborigines over
a very large portion of Australia his experiences and impressions have
a special value.</p>

<p>From Yass to near Narrandera they met very few natives, "not more
than fifty in an extent of more than 180 miles." These natives were
very friendly, each group guiding them to the limits of their own
district and then passing them on in a friendly way to the next group.
From Narrandera to the depot near Maude the natives became more
numerous, and rather less friendly, being inclined to steal if not
watched carefully.</p>

<p>After the boat journey had begun, contact with the natives was
necessarily more intermittent and opportunities for friendly relations
limited to the evenings in camp. From near Euston onwards the natives
became much more numerous. The first large group was hostile, then,
being treated patiently, gradually became very friendly, wishing the
party to remain with them. Near Kulkyne occurred the beginning of a
dramatic series of encounters. In the late afternoon of 19th January a
large body of natives appeared on the right bank of the river: soon
after, another large party appeared on the left bank, and the boat was
between two definitely hostile parties. Presently those on the left
bank all swam over to the right bank and the whole group showed clear
signs of hostility, "beating their spears and shields together by way
of intimidation."</p>

<p>Sturt landed at the usual time on the left bank, and while the men
were preparing camp, he set about making friendly contact with the
natives:</p>

<p>"I held a long pantomimical dialogue with them, across the water,
and held out the olive branch in token of amity.</p>

<p>"They at length laid aside their spears, and a long consultation
took place among them, which ended in two or three wading into the
river, contrary, as it appeared, to the earnest remonstrances of the
majority, who, finding their entreaties had no effect, wept aloud and
followed them with a determination, I am sure, of sharing their fate,
whatever it might have been."</p>

<p>Gradually they became quite friendly and went to the camp showing
great curiosity. Macleay joined in with their amusement, and he seemed
to have made particular impression on them--Sturt assumed that the
natives regarded him as the re-incarnation of some previously known
aboriginal. They gave him the name of Rundi, pressing him to show them
his side, as if the original Rundi had met with a violent death from a
spear wound in that place. In the morning the whole tribe, upwards of
150, assembled to watch the departure of the boats. Four of them
accompanied the party along the bank, among whom was one remarkable for
personal strength and stature. Sturt noted that several of this tribe
were disabled by leprosy, or some similar disorder, and that the most
loathsome diseases prevailed among them.</p>

<p>The next evening the four natives already mentioned joined them in
camp on a very friendly footing. Now they were to experience the clash
with the natives which had been made familiar by frequent repetition.
It is worth repeating again, and Sturt's account is given here
verbatim; the date was 23rd January:</p>

<p>"After breakfast, we proceeded onwards as usual. We had proceeded
about nine miles, when we were surprised by the appearance in view, at
the termination of a reach, of a long line of magnificent trees.</p>

<p>"As we sailed down the reach, we observed a vast concourse of
natives under them, and, on a nearer approach, we not only heard their
war-song, if it might so be called, but remarked that they were painted
and armed, as they generally are, prior to their engaging in deadly
conflict.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding these outward signs of hostility, fancying that our
four friends were with them, I continued to steer directly in for the
bank on which they were collected.</p>

<p>"I found, however, when it was almost too late to turn into the
succeeding reach on our left, that an attempt to land would only be
attended with loss of life. The natives seemed determined to resist it.
We approached so near that they held their spears quivering in their
grasp ready to hurl. They were painted in various ways. Some who had
marked their ribs, and thighs, and faces with a white pigment, looked
like skeletons, others were daubed over with red and yellow ochre, and
their bodies shone with the grease with which they besmeared
themselves. A dead silence prevailed among the front ranks, but those
in the background, as well as the women, who carried supplies of darts,
and who appeared to have had a bucket of whitewash capsized over their
heads, were extremely clamorous.</p>

<p>"As I did not wish a conflict with these people, I lowered my sail,
and putting the helm to starboard, we passed quietly down the stream in
mid-channel.</p>

<p>"Disappointed in their anticipations, the natives ran along the'
bank of the river, endeavouring to secure an aim at us; but, unable to
throw with certainty, in consequence of the onward motion of the boat,
they flung themselves into the most extravagant attitudes, and worked
themselves into a state of frenzy by loud and vehement shouting.</p>

<p>"It was with considerable apprehension that I observed the river to
be shoaling fast, more especially as a huge sand-bank, a little below
us, and on the same side on which the natives had gathered, projected
nearly a third-way across the channel. To this sand-bank they ran with
tumultuous uproar, and covered it over in a dense mass. Some of the
chiefs advanced to the water to be nearer their victims, and turned
from time to time to direct their followers. With every pacific
disposition, and an extreme reluctance to take away life, I foresaw
that it would be impossible any longer to avoid an engagement, yet with
such fearful numbers against us, I was doubtful of the result. The
spectacle we had witnessed had been one of the most appalling kind, and
sufficient to shake the firmness of most men; but at that trying moment
my little band preserved their temper and coolness, and if anything
could be gleaned from their countenances, it was that they had
determined on an obstinate resistance.</p>

<p>"I now explained to them that their only chance of escape depended,
or would depend, on their firmness. I desired that, after the first
volley had been fired, Macleay and three of the men would attend to the
defence of the boat with bayonets only, while I, Hopkinson and Harris
would keep up the fire as being more used, to it. I ordered, however,
that no shot was to be fired until after I had discharged both my
barrels.</p>

<p>"I then delivered their arms to the men, which had as yet been kept
in the place appropriated for them, and at the same time some rounds of
loose cartridge.</p>

<p>"The men assured me they would follow my instructions, and thus
prepared, having already lowered the sail, we drifted onwards with the
current. As we neared the sand-bank, I stood up and made signs to' the
natives to desist; but without success.</p>

<p>"I took up my gun, therefore, and cocking it, had already brought it
down to a level. A few seconds more would have closed the life of the
nearest of the savages. The distance was too trifling for me to doubt
the fatal effects of the discharge; for I was determined to take deadly
aim, in the hope that the fall of one man might save the lives of many.
But at the very moment, when my hand was on the trigger, and my eye was
along the barrel, my purpose was checked by Macleay, who called to me
that another party of blacks had made their appearance on the left bank
of the river. Turning round I observed four men at the top of their
speed. The foremost of them, as soon as he got ahead of the boat, threw
himself from a considerable height into the water. He struggled across
the channel to the sand-bank, and in an incredibly short space of time
stood in front of the savage against whom my aim had been directed.
Seizing him backwards, and forcing all who were in the water upon the
bank, he trod its margin with a vehemence and an agitation that were
exceedingly striking.</p>

<p>"At one moment pointing to the boat, at another shaking his clenched
hand in the faces of the most forward, and stamping with a passion on
the sand; his voice, that was at first distant and clear, was lost in
hoarse murmurs. Two of the four natives remained on the left bank of
the river, but the third followed his leader (who proved to be the
remarkable savage I have previously noticed) to the scene of
action.</p>

<p>"The reader will imagine our feelings on this occasion, it is
impossible to describe them. We were so wholly lost in interest at the
scene that the boat was allowed to drift at pleasure. For my own part I
was overwhelmed with astonishment, and in truth stunned and confused;
so singular, so unexpected, and so strikingly providential, had been
our escape.</p>

<p>"We were again roused to action by the boat suddenly striking upon a
shoal which reached from one side of the river to the other. To jump
out and push her into deeper water was but the work of a moment with
the men, and it was just as she floated again that our attention was
drawn to a new and beautiful stream, coming apparently from the
north."</p>

<p>The boat thus floating on a broad stream, the mass of natives was
left behind on the sand-bank to wrangle amongst themselves. Sturt
landed on the opposite bank a little lower down. The larger, and
hostile party, seeing this: "curiosity took place of anger: all
wrangling ceased, and they came swimming over to us like a parcel of
seals."</p>

<p>The party got back into the boat after Sturt had made a present to
the peace-making intervener, and pulled up the Darling. And that was
the end of that trouble.</p>

<p>From this point onwards they found so many natives that their
contact was continuous and they were, so to speak, passed on officially
from one tribe to the next--but the movements of the party were so
rapid that little time was spent with each group. The natives were
quiet and orderly, and no article was stolen. "Loathsome diseases" were
common, and "syphilis raged among them with fearful violence"--the
condition of the women effectively checking any impulse towards
irregular conduct amongst the men.</p>

<p>The filth of the natives and their repulsive condition--as well as
their growing familiarity--all combined to render contact with them
increasingly disagreeable: yet it was essential to keep on a friendly
basis.</p>

<p>Near Berri they met one of the most numerous of the groups they met
on the Murray, and some of these they met again at Overland Corner, the
natives having crossed the base of the long loop. Here the natives
tried to detain the boat and had to be pushed off forcibly. One old man
from this tribe took a great fancy to Hopkinson and told them they were
nearing the sea, and it was obvious that he had been to the coast at
some time: although the river was still keeping a north-westerly
course, the old man made it clear that it would soon turn
southwards.</p>

<p>With this old man was another native who "was small in stature, had
piercing grey eyes, and was as quick as lightning in his
movements."</p>

<p>Near Swan Reach, three days later, the old man again joined them in
the boat, and it then appeared he was returning home from a long
journey to the north. On that day, 4th February, they met the tribe of
this old man and he left them. From this point down to Wellington they
met several large tribes, all very friendly, and much healthier and
cleaner than the up-river natives.</p>

<p>As soon as they reached Lake Alexandrina and during the whole of
their stay on the lake the natives were increasingly hostile, so that
Sturt avoided contact with them. They were obviously familiar with guns
as they retreated as soon as Sturt handled one. Sturt attributed this
hostility to the behaviour of sealers on Kangaroo Island (see p.
81).</p>

<p>On the return journey there were fewer incidents. There was the
possibility of serious trouble at Overland Corner, the natives being
very troublesome, and controlled only by firm treatment. It was here
that "eight of the women, whom we had not before noticed, came down to
the water side, and gave us the most pressing invitation to land.
Indeed they played their part uncommonly well, and tried for some time
to allure us by the most unequivocal manifestations of love.</p>

<p>"Hopkinson, however, who always had his eves about him, observed the
spears of the men above the reeds. They kept abreast of us as we pulled
up the stream, and, no doubt, were anticipating our inability to resist
the temptations they had thrown in our way.</p>

<p>"I was really provoked at their bare-faced treachery, and should
most undoubtedly have attacked them, had they not precipitately
retreated on being warned by the women that I was arming my men, which
I had only done upon seeing such strong manifestations of danger."</p>

<p>From the Rufus River to the Merbein rocks they had no trouble,
although they still saw natives: in the rapids round the Merbein rocks
the natives actually helped them with the boat--one of them being the
same "remarkable man" who had intervened on the critical occasion at
the Darling mouth.</p>

<p>Near Euston they again had trouble; uncertainty as to the behaviour
of the natives gave Sturt some anxiety as to the safety of Robert
Harris with his relief supplies--the safety of these supplies becoming
now a matter of first importance.</p>

<p>On 21st March, on the Murrumbidgee, just north of Balranald, they
had their last conflict. This was a serious attack on two successive
nights, and was the only occasion on which Sturt actually fired at the
natives: but it was without deliberate aim, and no native was
injured.</p>

<p>They had no further trouble with the natives, and Sturt could, as he
did, write:</p>

<p>"It has been my pride that my path amidst savage tribes has hitherto
been a bloodless one."</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V - Norfolk Island and England</h2>

<p>After his return from this second expedition Sturt had resumed duty
with his regiment. On 24th July, 1830, he signed a General Order as
"Major," but this did not indicate any permanent promotion.</p>

<p>In the first flush of his success he did not at once realize, but
was soon to learn, that his ordered life of army routine and discipline
was nearly over; and that he was, for the rest of his life, to be
caught in a mesh of officialdom and intrigue, for which he was, by
training and temperament, quite unsuited.</p>

<p>The story of the next four years is involved, and can best be told
in a time sequence, having regard to the delay of five months each way
in transit of letters between Sydney and London, so that, to a letter
sent from Sydney in January, a reply could not be expected before the
end of October.</p>

<p>Immediately after his return to Sydney in May, 1830, Sturt had
written to his family in England telling them of his journey and its
geographical results. Sturt's father brought this information to the
notice of Sir George Murray, Secretary of State for the Colonies, and
the information must have been available beyond official circles as, in
a memorandum (December, 1830) by Wakefield and Gouger concerning new
ideas of colonial expansion, there is reference to the possibility of a
settlement near "a magnificent river just discovered by Captain Sturt,"
which had been traced for a thousand miles, and which would discharge
the whole produce of eastern Australia to St. Vincent's Gulf.</p>

<p>But, meanwhile, Sturt had been sent to Norfolk Island early in
August on military duty, and the year 1830 closed with Sturt still
there, anxiously awaiting news of the promotion which he believed
Darling was recommending. He could not know that neither his report nor
that recommendation had left Sydney.</p>

<p>[5-1] There are few official details about his period of service on
Norfolk Island. Giving evidence before the New South Wales Executive
Council on 27th February, 1832, Sturt said that he commanded the troops
at Norfolk Island from 6th August, 1830, to 7th July, 1831; there is no
reference to the presence of a senior officer.</p>

<p class="ref">[5-1 Mit. Lib. Minutes Exec. Co. Vol. 3. Appx. 4, p.225.]</p>

<p>[5-2] On the other hand, in a memorial to Lord Stanley in 1858, he
referred to this period of service and stated that he was sent
confidentially by Governor Darling to restore Norfolk Island to
tranquillity, its state at that time being the cause of serious
apprehension and alarm. He added that the mission was both difficult
and delicate in the presence of a senior officer.</p>

<p class="ref">[5-2 Public Records Office, London 5158. New South Wales.]</p>

<p>He remained on Norfolk Island until January, 1832, so that it might
be assumed that he was "in command" from August, 1830, to July, 1831,
and thereafter under the direction of a senior officer. A little
further information comes from official despatches. On 26th August,
1831, Governor Darling wrote to the Secretary of State informing him
that Colonel Morisset had requested that he be placed in some civil
situation in the Colony, his expectations of the position at Norfolk
Island having been totally disappointed. Darling added that it was his
duty to state that Colonel Morisset was [5-3] a very zealous officer
whose duties for some time past had been of a most arduous nature: he
described the conditions at Norfolk Island:</p>

<p>"The conduct of the prisoners is outrageous in the extreme, they
having, repeatedly, avowed their determination, which they have
endeavoured to carry into effect, to murder every one employed at the
settlement, and it is only by the utmost vigilance that they have been
prevented accomplishing their object. The prisoners at Norfolk Island
are men of the most desperate character."</p>

<p class="ref">[5-3 H.R.A. XVI. 338.]</p>

<p>It would seem that Colonel Morisset had been there throughout
Sturt's period of service. It is impossible with the evidence at
present available to determine this point. Sturt's period of service on
the island must have been eighteen months of rigorous discipline and
constant vigilance. He interested himself, as he did wherever he was,
in the natural history of the island, and on one occasion was prominent
in the rescue of some members of the [5-4] crew of the "Queen
Charlotte," who were trying to land the sick captain of that ship, in
one of the ship's boats, when it capsized.</p>

<p class="ref">[5-4 <i>Sydney Gazette</i>, 9th August, 1831.]</p>

<p>At Norfolk Island he gained experience in handling boats in heavy
surf, experience to which he gratefully referred in recalling his
difficulties, when, in 1838, he examined the Murray mouth at Encounter
Bay.</p>

<p>It was at Norfolk Island that Davenport became associated with Sturt
as personal servant. This relationship between master and servant,
common enough in those military days, has now quite disappeared. There
must have been more than the ordinary formal basis of service between
them, as this one-time servant became a friend of the family, and
continued so, loyally, till his death.</p>

<p>While Sturt was busy at Norfolk Island other developments were
moving slowly.</p>

<p>[5-5] On 17th February, 1831, Darling had sent off the first, very
brief report of Sturt's return and the results of the expedition.</p>

<p class="ref">[5-5 H.R.A. XVI. 89.]</p>

<p>[5-6] On 28th March, 1831, Darling sent to Murray a very long
despatch in which he referred to the Surveyor-General Mitchell in
harshly critical terms; he spoke of Mitchell's "extremely indecorous
insinuations and arrogant pretensions," of "his ill and ungovernable
temper which render him an impracticable servant of the Government,"
and he would have suspended him, but for the serious inconvenience this
would have caused. Darling correctly assumed that Mitchell had been,
improperly, writing direct to his associates in London. These
communications are not available, but their nature, and the general
position, can be assumed from the following extracts from Darling's
despatch:</p>

<p class="ref">[5-6 H.R.A. XVI. 119.]</p>

<p>"I am aware that Major Mitchell was very much displeased at not
being employed in exploring the interior.</p>

<p>"I would beg leave to ask how Major Mitchell, after his reiterated
representations of the backwardness of the survey, and his urgent
applications for additional means to bring up the arrear, could with
any degree of consistency, or even common regard to the interests of
the colony, have been employed as Captain Sturt was, on one occasion
for five months and another for six.</p>

<p>"I thought at the time that I had myself rendered some service in
inducing Captain Sturt and Mr. Cunningham to undertake their first
expeditions; they certainly had performed a most important one in
making known two considerable tracts of country hitherto unexplored,
and which, in Captain's Sturt case in particular, was only accomplished
by the most persevering determination to effect his object, and in
which he suffered privations to the great injury of his health.</p>

<p>"I do not hesitate to say that Major Mitchell would not have
performed these services in a more complete or advantageous manner; and
I shall leave you to judge of my disappointment in finding by the
Despatch acknowledging the receipt of Captain Sturt's and Mr.
Cunningham's reports, that I was not authorized to express on the part
of His Majesty's Government one word in commendation of the important
services they had rendered.</p>

<p>"The last discovery of Captain Sturt's is beyond all comparison the
most important that has ever been made in this Colony, a water
communication having been discovered from the settled districts to
Encounter Bay on the south coast."</p>

</center>

<p>This despatch prompts rather curious speculations. It is clear that
Mitchell was grossly insubordinate as a civil officer, and was
criticizing Sturt's selection as leader of exploring activities: but in
this despatch of Darling's the reference to Sturt and Cunningham could
refer only to Sturt's first expedition, and Darling must have had a
warm feeling of guilt and shame when he realized that it was only after
Sturt had been back from his second expedition for nine months that he,
Darling, had sent any report at all to the Home Government, and even
then Darling had coldly said:</p>

<p>"If interested in this matter you will find a sketch of his
operations in the Gazette."</p>

<p>He realized that he had made no comment on the value of the
discoveries, had expressed no appreciation, and had made no
recommendation for a reward for these valuable services.</p>

<p>[5-7] Moved, doubtless, by these thoughts, he sent off, on 14th
April, 1831, Sturt's own original report with a covering despatch in
which he drew attention to the fact that Sturt had suffered severely in
health as a result of the conditions under which he had performed the
two expeditions, and recommending him for promotion in army rank. This
despatch was followed, very soon, 4th June, 1831, by a [5-8] despatch
from Darling stating that it had been his intention to station Captain
Barker as "Resident" in New Zealand: but as that officer had been
killed at Murray mouth whilst engaged in following up Sturt's
discoveries, he now proposed to send Sturt to New Zealand instead to
conciliate the New Zealanders, Sturt's disposition and character being
very suitable to such a position. But something had happened to alter
this decision, for, from a despatch sent from London on [5-9] 18th
March, 1832, it is clear that Darling, on 7th September, 1831, had
written stating that he had abandoned his intention of sending Sturt to
New Zealand, being of opinion that a more advantageous mode of
employing that officer's services might be found by despatching him on
an expedition to explore the course of the river which he had
discovered flowing into the Murray and which he considered to be the
Darling.</p>

<p class="ref">[5-7 H.R.A. XVI. 242.]</p>

<p class="ref">[5-8 H.R.A. XVI. 263.]</p>

<p class="ref">[5-9 H.R.A. XVI. 561.]</p>

<p>And that was the end, for the time being at least, of Darling's
association with Sturt's fortunes: for the cumulative and persistent
intrigues against Darling had been successful and he was recalled,
leaving Sydney on 21st October, 1831.</p>

<p>Surely few official despatches have left Australia equalling in
dignity of protest this from Governor Darling to Lord Goderich:</p>

<p>[5-10] "Nor do I lay any claim to infallibility. If I have erred,
surely, my Lord, some allowance might have been made, if only in
consideration of the persons I have had to deal with.</p>

<p>"I have exerted myself strenuously to promote the views of His
Majesty's Government and maintain His Majesty's authority.</p>

<p>"If it be your Lordship's will that I should be the sacrifice, I
must submit."</p>

<p class="ref">[5-10 R.A.H.S. VIII. 176.]</p>

<p>Darling's successor, Bourke, did not arrive until 31st December,
1831: in the interval, Colonel Lindesay. Sturt's commanding officer,
was Acting Governor.</p>

<p>[5-11] Mitchell did not miss this opportunity, for, on 23rd
November, 1831, Lindesay wrote to Goderich a despatch the terms of
which, in view of all that had happened, are not only interesting in
themselves, but suggest some aspects of Mitchell's character.</p>

<p class="ref">[5-11 H.R.A. XVI. 464.]</p>

<p>After stating that he had authorized Mitchell to proceed to that
part of New South Wales hitherto unexplored between the Castlereagh and
Gwydir Rivers, he continued:</p>

<p>"When, in 1818, Mr. Oxley explored a portion of the territory, the
opinion from his report argued a vast area of depressed interior
stretching far to the west, and subject at certain seasons to total
inundation.</p>

<p>"This was the theory of an immense inland marsh into which the
waters of the Macquarie, Castlereagh, and other streams ultimately
subsided.</p>

<p>"These opinions, although somewhat shaken in 1830 by Captain
Sturt's' discovery of so large a river as the Darling pursuing a
south-west course, have been recently revived by the report of a
runaway prisoner of the Crown, who asserts to have travelled the
interior of New Holland running down the banks of a noble river rising
in the eastern coast ranges and pursuing a slow, steady, and unbroken
course about north-west through the vast levels of the interior and
emptying its waters into the open sea."</p>

<p>Mitchell's comment on this information was:</p>

<p>"That the waters from the mountain basin on the east reach the
north-western coast, is therefore extremely probable, unless these
waters are discharged by some broad and shallow estuary into the Gulf
of Carpentaria."</p>

<p>Lindesay was either very ignorant, or the willing accomplice of
Mitchell, or both. After all that had been done by Sturt, Mitchell, to
settle the highly important question of discharge to the northwestern
coast on the very doubtful testimony of a runaway convict, travelled
between the tracks of Oxley, Cunningham, and Sturt. The whole episode
is unconvincing.</p>

<p>So far as anything known in Sydney was concerned, at the end of 1831
the position was that Sturt's report had been despatched, but not
acknowledged; that Darling had decided not to send Sturt to New
Zealand; that Darling had left New South Wales; and that Sturt's own
commanding officer had swallowed an improbable story, and, yielding to
Mitchell, had sent the latter off on an expedition which was, on the
knowledge then available, fantastic.</p>

<p>Sturt had returned from Norfolk Island in October, 1831, to find a
situation completely unfavourable to his own interests: his friend and
supporter Darling going: a new Governor to whom he was unknown; his own
commanding officer Lindesay supporting his declared rival--if not
enemy--Mitchell: Mitchell off on an expedition which must have seemed
to Sturt to disregard and discredit all his own work: no word, after
eighteen months, of any promotion or recognition--for Goderich's letter
of 19th November could not have arrived. Beside all this he was
ill--never having fully recovered from the stresses of his two
journeys.</p>

<p>It is not remarkable that he sought leave, which Bourke readily
granted, covering his approval with a very generous letter to Goderich
(26th March, 1832):</p>

<p>[5-12] Captain Sturt, of the 39th Regiment, being in bad health, has
obtained leave to return to England. This officer has made two journeys
into the interior of the colony, and added much to the knowledge of the
geography of the southern portion of this vast colony.</p>

<p class="ref">[5-12 H.R.A. XVI. 575.]</p>

<p>"Captain Sturt is an officer of considerable intelligence and great
perseverance. He has, I fear, suffered irreparably from the constancy
with which he pursued his object, and the hardships he was exposed to
on his journeys.</p>

<p>"I feel it my duty to make these circumstances known, and to solicit
for this deserving officer Your Lordship's protection and support."</p>

<p>[5-13] Goderich, in London, had written, on 19th November, 1831, to
Bourke in Sydney stating that he had received Darling's despatch of
14th April with Sturt's own report. He agreed that Sturt had acquitted
himself in a manner highly satisfactory and creditable, and that he,
Goderich, had supported Darling's recommendation for promotion and had
brought "Captain Sturt's name under the favourable consideration of the
General Commanding in Chief."</p>

<p class="ref">[5-13 H.R.A. XVI. 459.]</p>

<p>Goderich continued by requesting Bourke to consider the desirability
of another expedition to determine whether the river flowing into the
Murray was really the Darling, and whether there was a passage from
Lake Alexandrina at Encounter Bay into St. Vincent's Gulf.</p>

<p>He did not then know that the latter point had already been settled
by' Barker, acting under Darling's instructions.</p>

<p>This letter could not have reached Sydney before Sturt's departure
so he could not have known anything about the reactions in London to
his most important discoveries: but he would, most probably, have known
of another letter written [5-14] by Goderich on 29th September, 1831,
criticizing the manner in which the several exploring expeditions had
been undertaken, and laying down the principle that these expeditions
should be controlled by the Surveyor General's Department. Goderich was
satisfied that not only would considerable expense be saved, but that
opportunities would be opened for assistant surveyors to gain valuable
experience. The despatch concluded:</p>

<p class="ref">[5-14 H.R.A. XVII. 382.]</p>

<p>"These observations are by no means intended as any disparagement of
the exertions and ability which Captain Sturt had displayed in the late
important discoveries which he has made."</p>

<p>Sturt would have seen that Mitchell's intrigues with the authorities
in England had succeeded. The prospect of military promotion seemingly
hopeless, the door to further exploration closed, his own health
broken, depression for his sensitive nature was inevitable.</p>

<p>Nothing is known of the journey to England, but he must have arrived
there before 11th September, 1832, for on that date he wrote to General
Darling, who was then living in France.</p>

<p>[5-15] To complete this story of the events of that interim period,
and the curious fluctuations of policy, it has to be recorded that, on
18th March, 1832, Goderich wrote again to Bourke expressing
satisfaction that Darling was not going to send Sturt to New Zealand,
intending instead to send him on a further expedition to determine the
course of the Darling.</p>

<p class="ref">[5-15 H.R.A. XVI. 561.]</p>

<p>Goderich approved that this objective:</p>

<p>"appears to be worthy of the enterprise and zeal in pursuing his
discoveries which have been manifested by Captain Sturt," and, if Sturt
were not available, another person, "calculated for the task" should be
employed. Goderich proposed that the person should start at the
Darling-Murray junction, follow the river up to Sturt's last point of
contact, and then strike off on a north-westerly course for three or
four degrees of latitude till he reached the longitude of 140 degrees,
should the nature of the country permit him to do so. No reference was
made to the previous ruling that expeditions were to be directed by the
Surveyor-General, This letter did not reach Sydney till long after
Sturt's departure. The course proposed led right up to the Cooper Creek
region. Neither Mitchell nor any other person "calculated for the task"
seems to have shown any enthusiasm, for nothing was done--nothing, that
is, till Sturt did it himself twelve years later.</p>

<p>On his return from the second expedition, Sturt had been given, as a
grant, a small allotment in Sydney of 1 acre 1 rood 3 perches, part of
which was then the Military Gardens which were worked by the soldiers
to provide vegetables for the military barracks in Sydney: upon this
there was a cottage so dilapidated as to be unserviceable. This grant
[5-16] was made to cover personal expenses incurred by Sturt. Before he
left Sydney he sold the land for &pound;450, which covered his personal
expenses and enabled him to give a small reward to the men who had
accompanied him on his expeditions.</p>

<p class="ref">[5-16 H.R.A. XVII. 461.]</p>

<p>[5-17] This grant was in what is now Portion 394, Parish of
Alexandria. It fronts George Street West (Broadway), Balfour Street
running within the grant on its north-east side.</p>

<p class="ref">[5-17 Information supplied by the Under-Secretary, Lands Department,
N.S.W.]</p>

<p>Sturt's stay in England, which lasted for two years, was a period of
depression and disappointment: prolonged illness undermined his health,
and his future prospects in life were exceedingly gloomy. He was in his
thirty-eighth year, and still unmarried.</p>

<p>His illness had been progressive; after his first expedition he had
not been well; after his second expedition he was probably suffering
from vitamin-deficiencies, from physical exhaustion, and overexposure;
he did not recover completely on Norfolk Island, and, ultimately his
health broke down completely, so that Governor Bourke could speak of
his health having "suffered irreparably." He became blind, losing
vision first in the right eye, then in the left. Although he was, for
four months, almost totally blind, it was not until he had persevered
for many weeks in a course of sarsaparilla that vision began to return.
Those are his own words in describing his condition.</p>

<p>[5-18] The sarsaparilla referred to was Smilax Glycyphylla, a member
of the lily family, which was highly esteemed for its medicinal
properties in the early years of the Sydney settlement. A decoction of
the leaves was used. Recently the berries have been analysed and found
to have a high content of ascorbic acid. It is hardly possible to
describe his illness in modern medical terms, as the description of
symptoms is inadequate. The blindness gradually, under treatment,
improved; but he was never, for the rest of his life, to regain full
vision. The doctor who attended him in London ascribed his condition to
a "coup de soleil," but it is most probable that prolonged subsistence
on an unsatisfactory diet, together with sustained physical exertion,
were accessory factors, if not the complete cause, of his condition.
The handwriting of a letter written by him to General Darling on 11th
September, 1832, shows that his vision was, by then, considerably
restored.</p>

<p class="ref">[5-18 Information kindly supplied by the Chief Botanist, Botanic
Gardens, Sydney.]</p>

<p>In that letter he stated that he would seek an interview with [5-19]
Lord Goderich and Lord Hill--the General Commanding in Chief.</p>

<p class="ref">[5-19 Sturt papers. Letter to Darling.]</p>

<p>Upon receipt of this letter Darling at once wrote to Mr. Hay of the
Colonial Office informing him of Sturt's condition and expressing his
own opinion that His Majesty's Government would not willingly add to
the disappointment Sturt already felt that his services had not been
recognized by some reward.</p>

<p>Darling wrote also to Lord Fitzroy Somerset, of the War Office,
giving details of Sturt's partial blindness and stating that the
prospect of recovery was very doubtful, and asking that Lord Hill would
reconsider his case and grant him promotion. Darling added generous
tribute to Sturt's character, efficiency, and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>From the War Office came the reply that Lord Hill was quite aware of
the importance of the services which had been rendered by Captain Sturt
"but he really feels that he could not recommend him for a brevet rank,
exposing himself and His Majesty's service to much inconvenience."</p>

<p>In view of the serious impairment of Sturt's vision, such a
decision, where executive military duties were involved, was
inevitable.</p>

<p>The year 1833 was a bad period for Sturt. He knew now that promotion
was out of the question, and no other avenue of advancement could be
seen. He was middle-aged, on a captain's pay with no private income.
For the first half of the year he was ill and very depressed, so that
his mother wrote (19th May, 1833):</p>

<p>[5-20] "Charles is full of difficulties created in great measure by
his extreme diffidence. He has too much delicacy of feeling to push his
own interests sufficiently. I hope he will now take courage to bestir
himself a little."</p>

<p class="ref">[5-20 Life. p. 104.]</p>

<p>But his character was stronger than that: he had to make the grave
decision whether he would finally abandon the army as a career, after
twenty years of service, and there was some natural hesitation. While
he was considering this, the authorities had not been unsympathetic or
forgetful. Issues were focalized when Sturt took the first step by
applying, in June, 1833, through the Secretary of State for the
Colonies to the Treasury [5-21] for some remuneration to compensate him
for the great expense which his illness--due to hardships in public
service--had involved. He was offered a pension of &pound;100 per annum
on condition that he retired from active service, the pension to
commence when he should cease to receive military pay, and to continue
until his sight was restored, or some situation could be conferred on
him by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p class="ref">[5-21 Sturt papers.]</p>

<p>Having, as he considered, no alternative, he accepted this pension,
sold his commission, and retired from the army, as from 19th July,
1833.</p>

<p>During that summer of 1833 he wrote his first book, <i>Two
Expeditions into the Interior of Southern Australia</i>, and
illustrated it with sketches, four of which were by Sturt himself, the
remainder by W. Purser from sketches by Sturt. His defective vision
made the writing of this book difficult, and he thought it necessary to
refer to this difficulty in the book itself. It is not possible, in
reading the book, to notice any evidence of these difficulties; in
fact, the two volumes are outstanding examples of brevity and clarity
in description; and the handwriting of his letter at this period is
clear.</p>

<p>The book was dedicated to the Earl of Ripon, Viscount Goderich--the
Goderich to whom reference has frequently been made already; the
Goderich of whom it has been said that:</p>

<p>[5-22] "He was a poor, ineffective, arid uninteresting speaker. He
was one of a class of men who manage somehow, nobody quite knows how to
make themselves appear indispensable to their political party."</p>

<p class="ref">[5-22 McCarthy: History of the Four Georges and William IV.
11.328.]</p>

<p>Sturt was to reproach himself, later, that he did not dedicate this
work to Darling, to whom he actually expressed regrets that he had not
done so. He explained that he had thought it to be his duty to gain the
favour of the Secretary of State: but he had been disappointed at the
response.</p>

<p>The book was published in 1833. It had one immediate and most
important result. As will be told more fully later, the movement
towards the foundation of a "Wakefield" colony had languished, but the
publication of Sturt's story of a large river and his almost lyrical
praise of the fertile river valley, brought the whole movement again
into vigorous activity. He was invited by the Under-Secretary Hay at
the Colonial Office to give his views as to the geographical prospects
of a settlement in South Australia in the region of the Murray River.
He gave these views in a long memorandum dated 17th February, 1834, in
which, having the benefit of Barker's survey of St. Vincent's Gulf, he
recommended the vicinity of Port Adelaide River as the site for the
first town:</p>

<p>"Because it appears to me that when the distant interior shall be
occupied, and communication established with the lake and the valley of
the Murray, the banks of this creek will be the proper and natural site
for the capital."</p>

<p>He showed again the great ability for judicial consideration of
evidence, and the prophetic vision, which he always seemed to have at
command. In that same letter to Hay occurs a proposal remarkable enough
at any time, but from a man recovering from a long illness and
depressed over his prospects for the future, it was evidence of courage
of an unusual order:</p>

<p>[5-23] "The chief object now is to discover what lies in the centre
of the continent, and if it please God to restore me again in a month
or so, as I am sanguine in hoping, I will, if you think my services
will be accepted, make a bold offer in proposing to traverse Australia
from west to east, from the Swan River to Sydney.</p>

<p>"Such would indeed be an undertaking worthy of Mr. Stanley's
encouragement, and the ambition of any man, and Australia, you know, is
my legitimate field. You are aware of my economical arrangements. I
have given the project frequent and mature thought, and with eight men,
six horses, six bullocks, and a proportionate supply of provisions, in
eight months after my departure from the western I would stand upon the
eastern shore of the Terra Australis Incognita--always with the
assistance of Providence."</p>

<p class="ref">[5-23 R.G.S.S.A. XVIII. 103.]</p>

<p>This letter contains the interesting statement that he had made
"astonishing progress towards recovery of eyesight" which he attributed
to the constant use of rose water.</p>

<p>While he was in favour of the idea of a colony in South Australia,
he did not approve of the current proposals for its establishment and,
as he said much later, he believed that if he had listened to the
promoters of that undertaking he might have commanded any appointment
under the scheme: His name does not appear amongst those present at the
public meeting in Exeter Hall, London, on 30th June, 1834.</p>

<p>He had decided to approach the Colonial Office for a grant of land
in New South Wales. He made his application in the form of a memorial,
dated 9th May, 1834, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.</p>

<p>[5-24] In this memorial, after reciting briefly his services in the
field of exploration and the great value of his discoveries, he pointed
out that every person hitherto employed in the interior survey of New
South Wales had been rewarded with very considerable grants of
land--Hume and Macleay both having been so rewarded, in connection with
Sturt's two expeditions immediately on their return to Sydney: and that
it was solely because General Darling had referred the matter of reward
to the Secretary of State that he, Sturt, the leader of the two
expeditions, had not been similarly rewarded.</p>

<p class="ref">[5-24 H.R.A. XVII. 461.]</p>

<p>He asked that he might be rewarded with a free grant of 2,560 acres.
However, he trusted that the benefits to which he was entitled as a
retired Captain of twenty years' standing would not be disturbed.</p>

<p><b>Sturt's Land at Ginnindera, near Canberra.</b></p>
</center>

<p>A copy of this memorial was forwarded by Spring Rice, of the
Colonial Office, to Governor Bourke, with a covering letter, dated 3rd
July, 1834, stating that, in consideration of Sturt's services, Bourke
was authorized to grant to Sturt 5,000 acres on the same terms as to
selection, sale, quit, rent, etc., as had been in force prior to the
adoption of the "Ripon Regulations." These regulations provided a new
system of land grants: prior to their existence grants of land had been
made free, and in this way much good land had been given away; after
1st August, 1831, when the new regulations came into force, all land
had to be sold by public auction, with a minimum price of five
shillings per acre. If, therefore, Sturt had applied for a grant in
1830 after his return from the second expedition, this would
undoubtedly have been granted and on the "free" conditions. As he
applied after 1831 a special dispensation was necessary for him to
receive his land without payment or conditions. This was the effect of
the decision conveyed to Bourke.</p>

<p>It was further decided that, as from the date of occupation of the
land so granted, his pension of &pound;100 was to cease, as also were
any benefits to which he might be entitled as a retired army Captain of
twenty years' standing.</p>

<p>In his covering letter to Spring Rice with the memorial, Sturt had
stated that if his health were restored his services would be at the
command of the Government either in promoting public good or in the
furtherance of geographical research. Bourke's attention was officially
directed to this offer, and Sturt was commended to Bourke's favourable
notice.</p>

<p>It seems clear that the value of his services had been recognised,
and that, but for his own declared preference for promotion within the
army rather than other rewards, some tangible expression of
appreciation would have been given earlier.</p>

<p>But now, after twenty-one months in England, his health was largely
restored: his army career was definitely finished: he had published a
book which--in view of the immediate and important effects it
produced--was one of the great events in Australian history: and he had
become a landed proprietor on a considerable scale.</p>

<p>He was in his fortieth year and still unmarried: but with the change
in his fortunes, decided to marry. He wrote to Darling [5-25] on 20th
August, 1834, telling him of this, in quaint language covering his
middle-aged embarrassment: "I had intended leaving England about the
middle of last month, but a singular train of circumstances has arisen
to prevent my doing so, and you will be surprised to hear that I am on
the eve of marriage, having determined to sacrifice ambition at the
shrine of domestic tranquillity, and to exchange a restless disposition
for one of quietude.</p>

<p class="ref">[5-25 Sturt papers.]</p>

<p>"I know not that of myself I should ever have thought of such a
measure; but it has been so strongly urged upon me that I have in a
measure been obliged to give way--not one letter have I received from
N.S. Wales in reply to my own, intimating my intention of returning to
Sydney, but it has contained the advice 'marry before you leave
England.'</p>

<p>"The Lady to whom I am about to be united has neither youth nor
beauty to recommend, but if the most pleasing manners, and the gentlest
disposition, extreme firmness of mind and acquirements of no common
order can weigh in the scale against such fleeting powers or render the
softer sex estimable in our eyes, I have not been inconsistent in the
choice I have made or built my hopes of domestic happiness on slight
ground.</p>

<p>"Beloved by all who know her and long known to my own family, Miss
Greene is one to whom I could pay in advance the strongest tribute of
confidence and esteem, nor can I doubt that she will make me a most
affectionate wife and be to me a cheerful companion."</p>

<p>Charlotte Greene was 33 years old. He was not disappointed--Mrs.
Sturt was a very loyal and competent wife and mother through many
difficulties and stresses in what must have been for her a young,
rough, strange land.</p>

<p>They were married on 20th September, 1834, at St. James, Dover, and
within a fortnight had sailed for Australia.</p>

<p>It is clear from this correspondence, having in view the time
involved in writing to Australia and receiving a reply that, at least
as early as September, 1833, he must have "intimated his intention" of
returning to Sydney, although the decision to make him a grant of land
was not made till the following year. Also to be noted is his letter of
17th February, 1834:</p>

<p>"The chief object now is to discover what lies in the centre of the
continent...Australia is my legitimate field."</p>

<p>The itch was still active.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI - Life in New South Wales</h2>

<p>[6-1] Upon their arrival in Sydney early in 1835 Sturt and his wife
stayed first with the Macleays at Brownlow Hill near Camden, and then
moved to "a pretty cottage on the outskirts of Sydney." The location of
this cottage is unknown.</p>

<p class="ref">[6-1 Life. p.113, 108.]</p>

<p>Ultimately he selected his grant in what is now the Australian
Capital Territory. Mrs. Sturt, in her biography, states that the grant
was gazetted in February, 1837, and she adds:</p>

<p>"Sturt delayed for some time to select his land, and the Survey
Office in Sydney warned him they would cancel his grant if he did not
exercise it within a given time. This notice found him lying ill at
Yarralumla, so, on hearsay and in haste, he chose his grant at
Ginningdera, near Queanbeyan, a block surrounded on three sides by the
water of the Murrumbidgee, the Queanbeyan, and the Ginningdera. The
land, however, is not good, and has suffered heavily from floods."</p>

<p>These statements by Mrs. Sturt require careful examination.</p>

<p>[6-2] The Secretary of State, Spring-Rice, had notified Governor
Bourke on 3rd July, 1834, that Sturt's application for a grant of land
had been approved. This approval reached Sydney on 1st December, 1834:
Sturt arrived in Sydney early in 1835:</p>

<p class="ref">[6-2 Life, p.108.] [6-2 H.R.A. XVII. 461.]</p>

<p class="ref">[6-3] On 17th April, 1835, he wrote to his brother William:</p>

<p class="ref">[6-3 Life. p.113.]</p>

<p>"You are aware that the Government gave me a 5,000 acre grant of
land, but I have not as yet made my selection, being puzzled as to the
locality."</p>

<p>Four days later, 21st April, 1835, he again wrote:</p>

<p>"I am on the eve of making a journey to select my acres. The country
to the south is described by several people as most beautiful. As soon
as I get my land I shall stock it with 1,000 sheep and 150 to 200 head
of fine cattle. As a beginning, that, I think, will do very well; and a
trip once or twice a year to see my establishment will be a pleasure to
me."</p>

<p>[6-4] It is to be presumed that he made the journey, as the order
for the land was issued by the Governor on 5th June, 1835; the land was
surveyed by Robert Hoddle on 25th November, 1835; was notified in the
Gazette of 8th February, 1836; and was finally "granted" on 3rd
February, 1837.</p>

<p class="ref">[6-4 Information supplied by the Under-Secretary, Lands Department,
N.S.W.]</p>

<p>Whether he actually visited and inspected the land itself is
uncertain; if, as Mrs. Sturt states, he was "lying ill at Yarralumla,"
which is only seven miles from the land in question, it is reasonable
to assume that he visited it.</p>

<p>[6-5] But Yarralumla was granted to T. A. Murray only in 1842. It
seems likely that Mrs. Sturt's information was inaccurate. It certainly
was so in respect to the statement that the land is not good and has
suffered heavily from floods, for the land rises steeply from each of
the three streams, and is good grazing land. He sold this land to
Charles Campbell' on 26th February, 1838, so that from 1835 to 1838 he
owned both this property and that at Mittagong.</p>

<p><b>Sturt's Mittagong Property.</b></p>
</center>

<p>From letters written in April, 1835, it appears that Sturt had cash
resources of something more than &pound;3,000 and was attracted by a
property at Luskintyre on the Hunter: he did not, however, proceed
further with this idea, but purchased property at Mittagong. This
property is also referred to by Mrs. Sturt as being in the "Bargo
Brush." Its location is, however, known.</p>

<p>In the newspaper <i>The Australian</i> the following advertisement
appeared in the issue of 4th August, 1835:</p>

<p>"To the inhabitants of Bong Bong, Berrima and its neighbourhood,
Captain Sturt having purchased the late property of Mr. Cutter at
Mittagong Range from Mr. Brownlow, and taken possession thereof, takes
this opportunity of informing the inhabitants of Bong Bong, Berrima and
their neighbourhoods, that the Mill will continue to be worked for the
convenience of the public as usual, and that care will be taken and
arrangements made to ensure every regularity.</p>

<p>"Every attention will be paid to those who may send grain to be
ground. All applications to be made to the Miller...22nd July, 1835.
Mittagong."</p>

<p>It is convenient to quote here also the advertisement of the sale,
by Sturt, of this property. The newspaper <i>The Australian</i> had
this advertisement in its issue of 12th January, 1838:</p>

<p>"Mittagong. T. W. Smart begs to intimate to his constituents...that
he has been honored with instructions by Captain Sturt to submit and
sell by public auction...the estate of Mittagong and late residence of
this gentleman containing nineteen hundred and fifty acres; bounded by
the new line of road to that town, and eastward by the old line of road
to Bong Bong, etc., etc., distant from Sydney seventy miles and twelve
miles only from Berrima.</p>

<p>"The situation and capabilities of this property are so well-known
to the public that the vendor feels he has little to say as to its
great eligibility whether as a cattle, dairy or agricultural
establishment, as a private residence for a family...It has a
commodious house with thirteen hundred acres of land attached as also
on the other portion of the estate a neat and comfortable verandah
cottage with a powerful stone built windmill which is constantly and
profitably employed."</p>

<p>These descriptions and some search of records make it possible to
state the location of Sturt's property. It consisted of four blocks all
fronting the old road from Sydney to Bong Bong; this road left the
present Hume Highway just south of Yerrinbool going straight over the
Mittagong range one mile east of the present town of Mittagong, joining
the Highway again just north of Moss Vale.</p>

<p>[6-7] Portions 26 (300 acres) and 33 (300 acres), Parish of
Mittagong, are on the eastern side of the road: these were conveyed to
Sturt on 2nd Marsh, 1835: that is, before the grant at Ginnindera
became effective. The mill was almost certainly on Portion 26. The
Lower Mittagong Public School is at the north-west corner of Portion
33. Portion 115, Parish of Mittagong (1,130 acres) has frontage to the
old road on the east, and the Hume Highway on the west. Sturt applied
to the Lands Department to purchase this portion in 1835, but it was
sold to J. T. Wilson in January, 1836. It was conveyed to Sturt on 23rd
August, 1836.</p>

<p class="ref">[6-7 Information concerning the Mittagong property has been supplied
by the Under-Secretary, Lands Department, Mr. A. V. J. Parry, of
Bowral, and Mr. J. Jervis, of Sydney.]</p>

<p>There was another small piece of 30 acres conveyed to Sturt on 2nd
March, 1835. It seems certain that this was Portion 73 on which Cutter
previously had had the well-known Kangaroo Inn.</p>

<p>There is a reasonable probability that the "commodious house" was
the Kangaroo Inn which had ten rooms, and probably this was Sturt's
residence. They lived at Mittagong for about two years--a life which
was certainly not without interest.</p>

<p>[6-8] They were here visited in 1836 by Rev. James Backhouse, who,
in his recorded reminiscences, describes Sturt as "a benevolent and
enterprising man well-known on account of his long exploratory
journeys."</p>

<p class="ref">[6-8 Backhouse: Narrative of a Visit to the Australian Colonies.
p.444.]</p>

<p>[6-9] There were several incidents with bushrangers, by whom Sturt
was greatly respected. It is recorded that the bushranger Martin Cash
"made for Goulburn and soon got an engagement as dairyman under Captain
Sturt, the famous explorer, on his Mittagong station; but quarrels with
a new overseer forced him to throw up his job." Joseph Harris, who had
been with Sturt for more than twenty years, was with him in Sydney in
1835, had now settled on his own land at Dapto. George Davenport, from
Norfolk Island, was with the family at Sydney and Mittagong.</p>

<p class="ref">[6-9 White History of Australian Bushranging. 1.62.]</p>

<p>There are other traces of this period. The eldest son, Napier
George, was baptized by Bishop Broughton on 1st January, 1837, at the
Church of England, Sutton Forest. The entry is still to be seen (No.
160) in the Register of Baptisms there.</p>

<p>[6-10] Governor Bourke forwarded, on 26th December, 1835, a panel of
names from which twelve nominee members of the Legislative Council were
to be selected. Amongst these appears the name of "Charles
Sturt--Mittagong." He was not appointed.</p>

<p class="ref">[6-10 H.R.A. XVII. 251.]</p>

<p>[6-11] He was at this time a member of the Committee of
Superintendence of the Australian Museum and Botanical Garden, having
been so appointed by official minute on 14th June, 1836. It seems that
he only attended a few meetings of the Committee, and, in the minutes,
there are only indirect indications of any active participation. On
14th July, 1836, he signed, with a number of other prominent people, a
memorial to the Governor against the introduction of secular
education.</p>

<p><b>Sturt's Home at Grange, Adelaide.</b></p>
</center>

<p>Early in 1837, Sturt, while still owning the Mittagong and
Ginnindera properties, bought a property at Varroville between
Liverpool and Campbelltown: it is on the main road between these two
towns, almost opposite the historic Denham Court
property--approximately five miles south of the Cross Roads. This
property, 1,000 acres, was bought from Thomas Wills for &pound;2,500.
At this farm he had 1,000 acres with water-holes in every paddock, was
able to gratify his passion for gardening, and in 1838,[6-12] was
visited by John Gould, the bird-artist, who admired Sturt's large
original collection of water-colours of Australian parrots, for which
he offered a large sum. But these paintings had been the delight of
Sturt's leisure: he had collected the rarer specimens at great trouble
and he would not part with them. These, together with letters and early
journals, were later stolen.</p>

<p class="ref">[6-12 Life. p.122.]</p>

<p>Some, however, are still in the possession of Sturt's grandson in
England.</p>

<p>The period of residence at Varroville was not free from trouble. A
very severe drought prevailed from 1836 to 1839, and, although Sturt
had 180 head of stock, and 350 acres under cultivation, his farming
was, financially, unprofitable.</p>

<p>Induced by the prospects of a market in the new Colony of South
Australia, Sturt left Sydney in charge of a party overlanding cattle.
An account of this journey is found in the next chapter, but it
involved Sturt's absence from his farm from April, 1838, to the end of
that year.</p>

<p>During his absence Mrs. Sturt had great trouble with the assigned
servants, until the arrival of Sturt's youngest brother, Evelyn. Mrs.
Sturt all through this period had the additional burden of her second
son, who was born on 22nd September, 1838.</p>

<p>Here, too, Mulholland, one of the Murray expedition, was overseer
for a time, but was found to be dishonest: Davenport remained a loyal
and very faithful member of the staff.</p>

<p>During the period at Varroville the eldest boy narrowly escaped
drowning in a pond which is still to be seen near the house.</p>

<p>Sturt's visit to Adelaide had introduced new elements into his
prospects, and, as will be detailed later, he decided to sell his land
and stock and accept an appointment in that new colony. The Varroville
property was sold on 25th February, 1839. This done, the family
embarked on 27th February, 1839, in the John Pine (106 tons) and after
a stormy voyage arrived in Port Adelaide on 2nd April.</p>

<p>Mention must be made here of the story of E. J. Eyre, for he and
Sturt became fast friends--each having the credit of being the first
explorer to traverse great tracts of new country.</p>

<p>[6-13] Eyre, a youth of seventeen years, arrived in Sydney on 28th
March, 1833: Sturt was then in England. Eyre, however, has recorded
that in January, 1837, on a visit to Sydney from his property
"Woodlands," he "met my old acquaintances and found some new ones,
amongst others I now for the first time met Captain Sturt, since become
an old and most valued friend."</p>

<p class="ref">[6-13 Mit. Lib. Eyre's Autobiography MSS. A.1806. p.153-4.]</p>

<p>An interesting point is that both Eyre and Sturt owned land near
Canberra: but Eyre, like Sturt, parted with his land.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII - First Visit to South Australia</h2>

<p><b>A.--CONDITIONS IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA</b></p>

<p>Apart from the military stations along the northern coast, the
official story of South Australia before Sturt's journey down the
Murray in 1830 consisted of the brief visits by Flinders and Baudin in
1801-02. These gained only a superficial knowledge of the coastline and
a very restricted area of the hinterland.</p>

<p>However, as early as 1803 or 1804, American sealers had a base on
Kangaroo Island; and, from 1806 onwards, gangs of lawless sealers and
runaway convicts had settled on, the island, and even visited Lake
Alexandrina before Sturt.</p>

<p>The establishment of South Australia was directly due to the efforts
of the advocates of the Wakefield theory of Colonization. Wakefield's
letters to the Morning Chronicle were published in 1829, and his famous
"Letter from Sydney" before May, 1830.</p>

<p>The National Colonization Society was founded in 1830 to give
practical expression to Wakefield's ideas. As already stated, knowledge
of Sturt's discoveries was already in London by December, 1830, as they
were referred to in a paper on the establishment of a settlement near
the magnificent river just discovered by him.</p>

<p>The National Colonization Society lasted only a few months; but it
had, in that time, decided to found a colony in South Australia for the
operation of the Wakefield system: the opposition of the Colonial
Office, led by James Stephen, was sufficient to prevent any practical
action. Sturt was not in England at that time, and was not in any way
associated with the movement.</p>

<p>Reference should, at this stage, be made to Barker's investigations.
During 1831 Captain Collet Barker, under instructions from Darling, had
examined the eastern shores of St. Vincent's Gulf. He landed at
Noarlunga, then at Port Adelaide; and, finally, landing at Rapid Bay,
he went overland to the Murray mouth, thus proving that there was no
channel between the Murray and St. Vincent's Gulf.</p>

<p>In 1831-32 a South Australian Land Company was formed, and this
Company had obtained from the Colonial Office a copy of Sturt's
Journal. This had produced an ineffectual resolution:</p>

<p>[7-1] "That the evidence submitted in respect to the soil, climate
and production...is sufficient to warrant the formation of a Colony in
these lands with all possible expedition."</p>

<p class="ref">[7-1 Price: Founders and Pioneers of South Australia. p.40.]</p>

<p>This Company did not last long. But the publication, almost
simultaneously in 1833, of Sturt's Two Expeditions into the Interior of
Southern Australia and Wakefield's England and America, had interested
a much wider public, and the whole scheme was revived.</p>

<p>This time a "South Australian Association" was formed--again the
principal actors were Wakefield and Gouger. The activities of this
Association led, ultimately, to the passing on 10th August, 1834, of a
Foundation Act establishing the Colony of South Australia.</p>

<p>It has to be noted that, until Sturt's arrival in England, and until
the publication of his story, the whole scheme had languished.
Thereafter it came to life, received official recognition, and a colony
was, by law, established. His great influence, and his status as one of
the real founders of South Australia, cannot be doubted.</p>

<p>The. Foundation Act provided that South Australia was to be a Crown
Colony, administered by the Colonial Office in the usual way; but there
was also to be a Board of Commissioners appointed by. Parliament to
manage the Wakefield system of land sales and emigration.</p>

<p>G. F. Angas was, at first, a member of this Board of
Commissioners.</p>

<p>[7-2] To revert to Sturt: he had been in England but had taken no
part in this movement until 27th January, 1834, when during a call at
the Colonial Office he discussed the proposal of the Association to
found a Colony. He was invited by Under-Secretary Hay to give his views
as to the geographical prospects of settlement, and did so in a long
and important letter, dated 17th February, 1834: to this letter
reference has already been made.. He recommended that the capital city
should be near the Port Adelaide River. There can be no doubt at all
that his personal influence at this stage was a very important factor
towards the decision of the Government to pass the Foundation Act.</p>

<p class="ref">[7-2 Price: loc. cit. p.41.]</p>

<p>As he did not approve of the scheme of administration he took no
further part. In an official minute by the Colonial Land and Emigration
Office on 11th August, 1834, it is stated:</p>

<p>[7-3] "We do justice to the character and motives of Captain Sturt.
By his enterprising expedition down the Murray he may be considered the
discoverer of South Australia, and to that journey the settlement may
be said in one sense to have owed its existence."</p>

<p class="ref">[7-3 Archie. S.A. Despatch No. 71. 12th Oct., 1843, from Secretary
of State.]</p>

<p>In October, 1835, a third body, the South Australian Company, was
formed--its moving spirit, Angas, resigning from the Board of
Commissioners, as he felt he could not sustain a divided loyalty.</p>

<p>The division of authority between the Colonial Office, which
retained in reserve its dominant powers, and the Board of Commissioners
to which the Colonial Office had surrendered its executive authority,
was an administrative error which was to cause much distress in the
colony, and great embarrassment to Sturt.</p>

<p>The establishment of the Colony began. Colonel Light, the
Surveyor-General, came first, entering the Port Adelaide River on 21st
November, 1836. He had absolute authority to determine the site of the
capital city, and selected the locality recommended by Sturt, to whom
he made full acknowledgment.</p>

<p>The Governor, Hindmarsh, came later, landing and proclaiming the
Colony at Glenelg on 28th December, 1836. A triangular contest arose.
The South Australian Company, being merchants, wished to have the
capital city at Port Adelaide. Hindmarsh, being financially indebted to
Angas, supported this and refused to approve of Light's Adelaide site.
Light, having full authority, would not concede anything, and the
Adelaide site was accepted.</p>

<p>In November, 1837, excitement was caused by the alleged discovery of
a fine harbour at the mouth of the Murray and Hind-marsh declared his
intention of removing the capital there. Light, having trouble with the
Board of Commissioners, resigned in June, 1838, and most of the survey
staff resigned with him--leaving the land surveys in chaos. Moreover,
the division of authority between the Governor, representing the
Colonial Office, and the Resident Commissioner, who held local
authority delegated by the Board of Commissioners, produced conflict
from the very day of landing: this, added to the failure of the
authorities in England to provide proper financial resources for the
new colony, resulted in the recall of Governor Hindmarsh, who left
South Australia in July, 1838. His successor, Gawler, reached Adelaide
in October, 1838--the government between July and October being carried
on by Mr. George Stephen, acting as Administrator. It was precisely in
this interim period, when there was no Governor, no Surveyor-General or
Survey staff, and excitement over the possibility of moving the capital
city to Encounter Bay on the mouth of the Murray--that Sturt first came
to Adelaide.</p>

<p><b>B. - THE OVERLAND JOURNEY</b></p>

<p>The confusion in administration had brought about a serious economic
crisis in Adelaide, which, increasing in 1837, had resulted in a
definite scarcity of food supplies.</p>

<p>Enterprising people in New South Wales saw an opportunity for
selling stock on the Adelaide market. Bonney and Hawdon, leaving
Melbourne in January, 1838, took a large mob of cattle overland,
arriving in Adelaide on 3rd April.</p>

<p>[7-4] Eyre left from near the present site of Canberra on 21st
December, 1837, with 300 cattle, arriving in Adelaide on 23rd July.
While these two ventures were proceeding, a group of merchants in
Sydney arranged to send another lot over: they invited Sturt to take
charge of this expedition.</p>

<p class="ref">[7-4 Uren and Stephens: Waterless Horizons. p.60.]</p>

<p>He did not publish any account of this journey, but left an original
diary "written in a fine, clear hand on several loose packets of small
note paper...adorned by tiny delicate sketches in pencil and water
colour."</p>

<p>This diary is now in the Rhodes House Library at Oxford.</p>

<p>In order to complete the blank in the knowledge of the Murray River,
Sturt travelled from Sydney to Hume's crossing place at Albury and then
kept strictly to the course of the river. Many times this resulted in
difficulties from marshy ground and from reeds 18 to 20 feet high: but
he wished to make sure of all the major bends in the river.</p>

<p>He had a mob of 300 cattle, some of which were his own, and from
time to time had great trouble in keeping them together. Sturt left
Sydney at the end of April, 1838, having with him Fraser, who had been
on both previous Expeditions, Robert Flood (who would be with him again
on the 1844 expedition), Lomas, Finniss, McLeod and Strangways.</p>

<p>The party travelled down the north bank of the Murray, passing the
junction of the Ovens on 29th May: here Sturt noticed the quandong with
the comment that, wherever it grows, emus are numerous. From this point
to the Darling they had very friendly relations with the natives, who
were invaluable as guides.</p>

<p>At the junction of the Edward River they crossed to the south bank
of the Murray; at this point the natives helped the men with their
work. Sturt noted that:</p>

<p>"Many were pitted as if by smallpox. This disease, which was raging
among them on the Darling in 1828, and on the Murray in 1829 (see pp.
25, 55), must have committed dreadful havoc, since on this journey I
did not see hundreds to the thousands that I had formerly met.</p>

<p>"I could not contemplate without a feeling of melancholy the remnant
of these unfortunate people. A new era was dawning, and a fearful
change was coming upon them, whether for good or evil God only
knows."</p>

<p>They crossed the Loddon on 26th June and here, picking up the tracks
of Mitchell, Hawdon and Bonney, and Eyre, they were on "the great high
road of the interior." Passing the Murrumbidgee junction on 10th July,
they reached the Darling Junction on 24th July. Sturt approached the
Darling Junction with feelings of apprehension of trouble with the
natives: indeed, an unfortunate incident did nearly provoke a serious
conflict, but no tragedy occurred.</p>

<p>Sturt took the opportunity of making a careful sketch of "that
beautiful scene"--the Darling junction. From here the journey was
troublesome; their tea, sugar and salt were exhausted; there was, of
course, plenty of meat, but without salt this was not very palatable.
At this stage Sturt wrote in his diary:</p>

<p>"Would to God I were at Adelaide! Could I have foreseen the tedious
length of this journey, I had never left my home."</p>

<p>Near Lake Bonney they had further trouble with the natives, but soon
after leaving there, Sturt, going to settle some trouble with the
natives, recognized the old man* "who had formerly joined us in-the
boat. He was not satisfied till I permitted him to sleep at my tent. At
his bidding all the blacks left their camp, and the night passed
quietly."</p>

<p>(*See p 42.)</p>

<p>Thereafter there was no incident: they followed the Murray down to
just south of Blanche Town, then turned west across country to the
ranges, and brought the cattle to a permanent camp under Mt. Barker on
27th August, after a journey which Sturt considered to have been more
fatiguing than either of his expeditions..</p>

<p>Both Eyre and Sturt had difficulty in selling their stock. Although
there was great need in Adelaide for both meat and livestock, there was
a great lack of money. The venture was not profitable for Sturt,
although Eyre had cleared a reasonable profit. It is possible that the
events now to be described distracted Sturt's attention from his own
personal interests.</p>

<p>The occasion of Sturt's first visit to Adelaide is an appropriate
place to mention that Captain Barker, during his investigations of the
eastern shore of St. Vincent's Gulf, had named the Sturt River. This
small stream, which bears the same name to-day, runs into the sea at
Glenelg, passing about six miles south of Adelaide.</p>

<p><b>Departure from Adelaide of Central Australian Expedition.</b></p>
</center>

<p><b>C.--ADELAIDE AND ENCOUNTER BAY</b></p>

<p>As already stated, Sturt first saw the new city, of which he
regarded himself in some sense as the founder, at a time of economic
confusion rather intensified by the interregnum of suspended
government.</p>

<p>It was natural that he should be deeply interested in the workings
of a novel scheme of colonization of which he had disapproved, but for
some share--even unwilling--in which, he must accept
responsibility.</p>

<p>He had arrived at Mt. Barker on 28th August, 1838, and, on his
appearance in Adelaide, was given a very warm welcome. On 7th September
a public dinner was given in his honour. The following extracts from a
contemporary newspaper report of this dinner give some indication of
the conditions at that time:</p>

<p>"Upwards of 100 of the most respectable inhabitants assembled on
this occasion; and we rejoiced to perceive from the numerous attendance
of gentlemen of all shades of opinion that on this occasion at least
they had the good taste to lay political feelings altogether aside.
Captain Sturt accompanied by the Acting Governor was received with a
double salute of guns and immense cheering. Mr. Morphett proposed the
health of Captain Sturt, which was received with enthusiastic cheering
and applause.</p>

<p>"Captain Sturt returned thanks in a most feeling and characteristic
speech. We regret the lateness of the hour prevents our giving an
outline of it. The announcement that the Captain intended forthwith to
set out for the purpose of thoroughly examining Lake Alexandrina and
its communication with the sea was received in a manner which showed
how deep and general was the interest felt in the settlement of the
important points connected with the investigation.</p>

<p>"The harmony of the meeting was partially interrupted by the
disgraceful misconduct of Mr. Edward Stephens, cashier of the South
Australian Company's Bank; but this person's misbehaviour was soon
repressed by the prompt interference of the Governor, and the general
and strong indignation of the company."</p>

<p>This criticism of Mr. Stephens in a public newspaper gives some
indication of the friction between the three authorities which so
disturbed the first years of the Colony. Mr. Stephens was an officer of
the South Australian Company: the newspaper was the Government
organ.</p>

<p>Sturt in his speech offered some mild criticism of the
Commissioners:</p>

<p>"I am happy in the opportunity of touching on two other points
connected with the views of the Commissioners in England.</p>

<p>"I mean their wish to establish steam navigation and railroads
between Sydney and Adelaide.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen! both are utterly impracticable.</p>

<p>"The Murray and Hume rivers run over a distance of more than 2,000
miles, and their channels are so choked up with timber that it would be
the work of years to clear them.</p>

<p>"But if the plans are practicable there are not exports to repay so
gigantic a speculation.</p>

<p>"I speak thus candidly and openly to save many, I hope, from ruin.
If the Commissioners would consult their own interests, let them turn
their attention to the solid improvement of this beautiful
province...</p>

<p>"The country at the base of Mt. Barker in its present luxurious
state far exceeds in richness any portion of New South Wales that I
ever saw: indeed, even in England I have seldom observed a closer sward
or more abundant herbage growing."</p>

<p>Colonel Light was unable to act as chairman of this dinner as his
health was bad, and he was afraid that, if he attended the dinner, he
would be ill again. He died thirteen months later from pulmonary
tuberculosis. In the letter expressing his regret that he was unable to
preside he said that no one had more reason to acknowledge himself
indebted to Captain Sturt than he had.</p>

<p>The proposal to move the capital to Encounter Bay had caused an
immediate halt in land sales in Adelaide; and, as the Wakefield scheme
of colonization was based on the receipt of revenue from the sale of
land, this proposal caused great concern to those who had already
bought land; and administrative confusion because, sale of land being
suspended, no revenue was being received.</p>

<p>It was urgently important to get this issue determined, and the
Administrator, George Stephen, asked Sturt if he would visit the
locality and give his advice.</p>

<p>Sturt hired a crew and left Adelaide for Encounter Bay on 11th
September, going by land and arriving at Victor Harbour on 14th
September.</p>

<p>The next day he proceeded to Port Elliott, leaving here on 16th
September in a small boat, keeping along the coast inside the outer bar
in a heavy ground swell. By eight o'clock, after rowing fourteen miles,
they were opposite the river mouth, but the line of breakers across the
entrance made the passage impossible. They turned round, crossing the
entrance again westwards, and the sea became rougher. After another
attempt to the eastward they had to return, running six miles westward
and, through heavy surf, ran the boat up on the beach.</p>

<p>Next morning, 17th September, they dragged the boat across and
launched it in the Goolwa channel hoping to run out to sea through the
mouth from inside. They tried the passage, but failed, and Sturt landed
on the eastern point, Barker's Knoll.</p>

<p>On the 18th the sea was too heavy for a fresh attempt, and Sturt
spent the day taking soundings and bearings and examining Hind-marsh
Island. Another attempt to run the channel was made on 19th September,
but failed, and they narrowly escaped being swamped.</p>

<p>On 21st September they made the final attempt without any more
success, and gave up, Sturt returning to Adelaide on 22nd
September.</p>

<p>He reported to Stephen, stating that while, doubtless, the passage
could be effected both ways, it could only be in calm weather during a
long prevalence of north-east winds: that while steamers could travel
on the lake and up the Murray as far as the North-West Bend, every
thinking and cautious seaman would support him that Encounter Bay and
the region of the Murray mouth was unsafe for vessels.</p>

<p>He did point out that there was easy land communication between
Goolwa and Victor Harbour, where a breakwater could be built. His
judgment was sound, and stands to-day.</p>

<p>The Southern Australian of 29th September, 1838, commented that
Sturt had at last settled the question of a safe harbour at Encounter
Bay and a navigable entrance into Lake Alexandrina, and, after tilting
at those who had favoured the removal of the capital, added:</p>

<p>"Every effort has been made to establish as a truth what Captain
Sturt has at last virtually declared to be a falsehood."</p>

<p>Once again his thorough methods of examining all aspects of a
problem had placed a disputed point beyond further discussion. As a
result of this decision administration became more stabilized, and land
values in Adelaide began to rise.</p>

<p>Sturt then spent from 26th to 30th September examining the country
along the gulf north of Adelaide and discovered Port Gawler. He also
made recommendations for the improvement of Port Adelaide. His reports
on the overland route along the Murray, the Murray mouth, and Port
Adelaide, were all forwarded by Stephen to the Colonial Office.</p>

<p>On 12th October, 1838, Governor Gawler arrived and assumed office.
Sturt met him and talked with him about conditions in South Australia:
these talks could not have been prolonged as Sturt joined the ship
"Hope" at Encounter Bay on 16th October and arrived in Sydney on 30th
October to learn of the birth of his second son (22nd September) and
the serious illness of his eldest son.</p>

<p>One more fact remains to be mentioned. It was during this visit that
Sturt bought the land in the locality known as the Reed Beds on Port
Adelaide River, on which, later, his house "Grange" was to be
built.</p>

<p><a name="ill-57"></a><img alt="" src="0700391h-images/sturt-35a.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Sturt's Land at Grange.</b></p>
</center>

<p>What moved him to buy land on the Reed Beds, with the reed beds of
the Macquarie, the Lachlan, and the Murray so recent and so unhappy a
memory? to buy land subject to flooding like the reed beds of those
other rivers?</p>

<p>Was it a puckish thumbing of the nose at Fate, or just that it had a
pleasant frontage to a pretty river? What moved him to buy land at all?
Had he, even then, decided to return; was it a blind speculation in
future happiness, or just speculation in land?</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII - The Period of Governor Gawler</h2>

<p>On 27th February, 1839, Sturt, having sold his property in New South
Wales* embarked with his family on the schooner "John Pirie" for South
Australia to assume the position of Surveyor-General: they arrived at
Adelaide on 2nd April. As he passed through a very unhappy period in
South Australia it is necessary to examine each development as it
occurred. [8-2] Documents are available which tell the story; a
memorial forwarded by Sturt in 1843 through Governor Grey to the
Commissioners of the Treasury in England, Grey's comments on this
memorial, and a memorandum by the Commissioners of the Colonial Land
and Emigration Office setting out the history of the relative matters
from the records in their office. These are all authentic and official
documents, and are sufficient and acceptable evidence of the facts as
they appeared to each of the parties concerned.</p>

<p>(* He had sold his Mittagong property in January, 1838, his
Ginnindera property on 26th February, 1838, both of these before his
overland trip to Adelaide. His Varroville property he sold to Gilchrist
and Chambers on 25th February, 1839. Had he remained in New South Wales
and retained the properties, he would have become a wealthy
pastoralist: evidently South Australia, even with its uncertain future,
attracted him more than the prospect of wealth.)</p>

<p class="ref">[8-2 Public Records Office, London. C.O. 13/31.]</p>

<p>[8-3] Also are available private letters written by Sturt to
Darling, then living retired in England. Before discussing these
developments in detail it is necessary to give a brief statement of the
general administrative control of the colony.</p>

<p class="ref">[8-3 Sturt papers.]</p>

<p>The Colonial Office had ultimate authority and appointed the
Governor; the Commissioners had independent authority under the statute
creating them, and also had delegated authority from the Colonial
Office; they appointed a local representative in South Australia--the
Resident Commissioner; the South Australian Company also had a local
representative.</p>

<p>In addition to these the Treasury in London had the last word in all
financial matters.</p>

<p>[8-4] The situation has been well summarized by Mills:</p>

<p class="ref">[8-4 Mills: The Colonization of Australia. p.233.]</p>

<p>"The Commissioners had to provide funds by loans for a government
for which they were not responsible, and the Governor, who was
responsible alone to the Colonial Office, had to depend for his
suppliers on the Commissioners.</p>

<p>"Authority was divided in two ways; first the Governor was
controlled directly by the Colonial Office in the normal way, and also
indirectly by the Commissioners' control of supplies; next, in the
colony, the disposal of land was in the hands of a Resident
Commissioner responsible to the Commissioners alone, and with the
exercise of his duties the Governor could not interfere.</p>

<p>"Moreover, no provision was made for any local control over
expenditure."</p>

<p>Confusion and mismanagement led to the recall of Hindmarsh, and,
with Gawler's appointment, the two offices of Governor and Resident
Commissioner were united in the one commission, so that Gawler, in his
single person, was, as Governor, responsible to and directly controlled
by the Colonial Office; and, as Resident Commissioner, responsible to
the Commissioners upon whom he was dependent for the funds necessary to
carry on the colonial government.</p>

<p>The Commissioners gave Gawler very full authority to incur special
or extraordinary expenses in cases of "most pressing emergency," and
added: [8-5] "The Commissioners assure you that it is their wish by
every means in their power to support and strengthen your authority,
and to treat with the most favourable consideration such deviations
from your instructions as you may think it your duty to make."</p>

<p class="ref">[8-5 Price: Founders and Pioneers of South Australia. p.146.]</p>

<p>Gawler found on his arrival that the quarrels between various
sections under Hindmarsh's administration had produced stagnation and
chaos. Land speculation, and the very backward state of the land
surveys caused by these quarrels and by Light's resignation, added
greatly to this confusion.</p>

<p>[8-6] Before Gawler's arrival Stephen had offered Sturt the position
of Colonial Secretary; this Sturt refused, not knowing whether Gawler
would confirm the appointment. It is well to note the following dates:
Sturt left Sydney on 27th February, and arrived in Adelaide on 2nd
April, 1839.</p>

<p class="ref">[8-6 Life. p.155.]</p>

<p>But the South Australian Gazette of 2nd February, 1839, had notified
that: "His Excellency the Governor has been pleased to appoint Charles
Sturt, Esquire, J.P., Surveyor-General of the Province in the room of
William Light, Esquire, resigned, until Her Majesty's pleasure be
known."</p>

<p>It is obvious that there had been time for a communication to go
from Gawler in Adelaide to Sturt in Sydney and for a reply from Sturt
to have arrived in Adelaide.</p>

<p>[8-7] A letter had been sent by Gawler on 8th November, 1838,
offering the post to Sturt.</p>

<p class="ref">[8-7 Life. p.179.]</p>

<p>[8-8] But there is even earlier evidence; Stephen had written to
Sturt on 25th October, 1838, asking him to take up his duties, as
Surveyor-General, as quickly as possible.</p>

<p class="ref">[8-8 Archiv. S.A.]</p>

<p>There seems, therefore, little doubt that, as Sturt had left
Adelaide on 16th October, the position had been offered and, at least
tentatively, accepted while Sturt was in Adelaide, and after Gawler's
arrival.</p>

<p>Later it became important to determine whether Gawler had authority
to make this appointment.</p>

<p>It would seem reasonable to assume that the general authority
already quoted was ample to cover such an appointment.</p>

<p>But there was, additionally, the following authority:</p>

<p>"The Commissioners do hereby place in your hands the fullest and
most ample powers to reorganize the surveying staff in whatever manner
and to whatever extent may appear to you most expedient in order to
render it efficient and to remedy...the interruption and delay which
these resignations have occasioned."</p>

<p>Sturt, therefore, was appointed as Surveyor-General at a salary of
&pound;600 per annum with A seat on the Council. This Council,
variously described as "Council," "Council of Government," "Executive
Council," "Executive and Legislative Council," was a nominee body, and
the only authority other than the Governor. Its authority was very
limited.</p>

<p>Sturt continued to occupy this position until, suddenly, Lieut.
Frome arrived on 18th September, 1839, having been appointed as
Surveyor-General by the Commissioners in England without reference to
Gawler. When, in his memorial of 1843, Sturt referred to the injustice
thus done to him, he said:</p>

<p>"Colonel Gawler made your memorialist acquainted with his
instructions and the authority on which he was proceeding to reorganize
the Survey Department, which left no doubt either in your memorialist's
mind, or of the friends with whom he consulted, of the power given to
secure the services of a competent officer and to appoint him
permanently Surveyor-General contingent on the approval of Her
Majesty's Government."</p>

<p>He was here referring to the specific authority quoted above, and he
added:</p>

<p>"What I did accept was wholly disproportionate to the sacrifices I
was called upon to make and to the duties required of me, nor would I
have accepted office as I did if I had not concluded that it would be
permanent and would afford me that rank and consideration to which I
consider I am entitled by birth and by my past and present
services."</p>

<p>The Commissioners in their comments (which were made four years
after the events to which they related) pointed out that the authority
to which Sturt referred and upon which he largely based his case, was
dated in London, 2nd December, 1838, and could not have been known to
Sturt when he accepted the appointment: actually the letter could not
have arrived in Adelaide till well after Sturt's arrival. The
Commissioners sum up the position thus:</p>

<p>"Captain Sturt observes in his Memorial to the Treasury that he was
influenced by the perusal of the Commissioners' communications to
Colonel Gawler, which appeared to him to contain ample authority for
his appointment.</p>

<p>"We are bound, therefore, to point out that the appointment cannot
be said to have proceeded on that authority.</p>

<p>"For so far back as the 26th of October, 1838, long before the
letter was even written in England, Colonel Gawler had mentioned that
he had reason to believe that Captain Sturt would be 'gratified with
the office'. And on the 14th March, 1839, he distinctly notified
Captain Sturt's acceptance of it; yet it was not till the 29th of March
that Captain Sturt appears to have arrived in South Australia, and it
seems that it was subsequently to reaching the Colony that Captain
Sturt was shown the letter in question from the Commissioners."</p>

<p>One statement in this comment is interesting; it shows that Gawler
was able to say, on 26th October, that Sturt would be gratified with
the position. Sturt was then at sea on his way from Adelaide to
Sydney--so that this impression must have been gained during talks with
Sturt in Adelaide. The Commissioners then said:</p>

<p>"If Colonel Gawler made any other than a provisional appointment
before the receipt of special authority from Home, he clearly exceeded
his powers. It need scarcely be said that the patronage of the higher
offices of Government was never delegated to the Resident Commissioner.
Colonel Gawler's general instructions expressly render all appointments
by him subject to revision in this country. If the appointment of
Captain Sturt is understood as resting on the Commissioners' letters of
2nd December, 1838, we have to state that Colonel Gawler's power under
it was strictly limited to temporary purposes.</p>

<p>"We are obliged to conclude that neither Colonel Gawler was entitled
to confer nor Captain Sturt to expect any other than a provisional
appointment."*</p>

<p>(* See also Appendix D, Note 6.)</p>

<p>The Commissioners concluded that, under the unfortunate
circumstances, they had authorized the payment of &pound;600 for one
year from Sturt's arrival in Adelaide.</p>

<p>That is the story of a most unhappy incident. There is no reason to
doubt Gawler's sincerity: he must have believed that he had the
authority necessary to make the appointment. The cold-blooded review of
the papers four years later takes no account of the atmosphere in the
Commissioners' office in 1838, or the verbal instructions Gawler had on
departure. Sturt had had no, experience of this, one of the commonest
pitfalls in official life, especially in civil service.</p>

<p>Another factor must not be overlooked: in the letter covering the
memorial of 1843 Sturt, addressing the Secretary of State for the
Colonies, said:</p>

<p>"It may be, my Lord, that as its discoverer, I was unconsciously
influenced in favour of the Province, and yielded too readily to the
offer made by Colonel Gawler, but this, I would respectfully urge,
should not be held against me."</p>

<p>By anticipating a little, the story of his official position during
1839 has been told: some details of his activities during that year are
known. His appointment did not escape criticism.</p>

<p>The Southern Australian, the "opposition" newspaper, in its issue of
3rd April, 1839, regretted that they could not offer him the same
welcome as they had given him on his first visit--he had returned as a
politician, a position which, they thought, he could never gracefully
fill.</p>

<p>The Gazette (6th April, 1839), the Government organ, in reply,
thought that if anybody might have escaped, this abuse Sturt would have
been the man.</p>

<p>Quite unknown to Sturt, then or at any time later, P. P. King in
Sydney wrote (3rd February, 1839) to Mitchell, then in London:</p>

<p>[8-9] "Sturt has just been appointed Surveyor-General of South
Australia, and is selling all his property to go there--that's what may
be termed a humbug humbugged--and how the Company could be humbugged by
him I cannot find out.</p>

<p>"I am glad you have not noticed Sturt in the book*; you had abundant
cause: but your silence will be felt more than any vituperation or
remarks."</p>

<p class="ref">[8-9 Mit. Lib. A.292. p.552.]</p>

<p>(* Presumably <i>Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern
Australia</i>.)</p>

<p>In view of the letters Sturt, later, wrote to King (see p. 110) the
speculation arises whether it is, or is not, better to know what others
are thinking or writing.</p>

<p>During his year of office as Surveyor-General Sturt was very busy
reorganizing the Survey Department, and the best indication of his
success is the fact that the staff, on his retirement from that
Department, presented him with a very handsome silver vase*, which is
still in the possession of Sturt's grandson.[8-10] An interesting
incident is that, on 7th August, 1839, he sent out instructions that,
as, owing to the want of proper fresh provisions, scurvy had occurred
in several of the survey parties, he had purchased a flock of wethers,
and these would be sent forward from time to time to the different
parties in the field. Full instructions were given as to the careful
weighing of each carcase, and the issuing of proper rations so that
there should be no waste. It should be noted that there was never, at
any time, friction between Frome and Sturt.</p>

<p>(* See Appendix D, Note 7.)</p>

<p class="ref">[8-10 Hawker: Early Experiences in South Australia. pp.39-47.]</p>

<p>During 1839 sometime Sturt delivered a public address in which he
urged all who could to get out on to the land and develop it: he
stressed the need for conservation of water, and predicted that
valuable deposits of the richer ores would be found in the ranges to
the north.</p>

<p>Of his private life there is little information. His wife wrote
(20th April, 1839) to a friend:</p>

<p>[8-11] "We are totally houseless, although we had been assured that
a cottage would be available on our arrival. I have no assistance from
my good hubby, for as usual he is truant-like and gone on a survey
expedition with the Governor...which by the way he could not avoid, as
the Survey Department is in such a state of disorder that his immediate
attendance to his duties was required or he would not have left me to
struggle alone."</p>

<p class="ref">[8-11 Archiv. S.A. A.713. B.2.]</p>

<p>Their first home in Adelaide was on East Terrace: from the available
evidence it may reasonably be accepted that the house was on Town Acre
288 at the corner of East Terrace and Wakefield Street. Here, in 1840,
the third son was born.</p>

<p>[8-12] At this time Sturt received a second visit from Gould, the
authority on birds: he took Gould with him on one of his surveying
expeditions, and helped him to outfit for a collecting journey to the
Murray. In November, 1839, Gawler and Sturt, with Gawler's sister,
Sturt's wife, three friends, and two attendants, set out with the
purpose of embarking near Goolwa, proceeding up the river to the
North-West Bend, and thence returning overland to Adelaide. They
reached the Bend without accident. From this point Gawler, Sturt,
Inman, Craig and Bryan (a young man staying with the Gawlers) set out
to explore the country to the north-west, making towards a distant
mountain which Gawler named Mt. Bryan, in honour of his young
friend.</p>

<p class="ref">[8-12 Chisholm: Strange New World. p.39.]</p>

<p>It was mid-summer and their water supply was inadequate, much having
leaked at the first night's camp. Disaster overtook the party on their
forced march back to the river, Gawler having a narrow escape. Bryan
wandered off into the bush, and was never found. The party returned to
Adelaide on 28th December, relieving considerable public anxiety as to
their fate.</p>

<p>The year 1840 passed without particular incident, except for the
change in Sturt's position following Frome's arrival.</p>

<p>It has here to be noted that Gawler, in offering Sturt &pound;600
per annum, had stated that he would recommend that amount, but that
pending confirmation from England he could not pay more than &pound;500
per annum. As stated above, the &pound;600 salary was ultimately
approved, and the "back pay" was made up--so that Sturt received
&pound;600 up to 2nd October, 1839,* when he was appointed [8-13]
Assistant Commissioner of Lands at a salary of &pound;500 per annum. In
addition to this salary he was allowed forage for two horses--the value
of which brought the total value of his emoluments up to more than
&pound;600 per annum. Captain Grey had visited Adelaide in March, 1840,
slowly recovering from the hardships of his explorations of the
"north-west" of Australia: he was the guest of Colonel Gawler for a
short time before returning to England.</p>

<p>(* The date on which Frome assumed duty.)</p>

<p class="ref">[8-13 Archiv. S.A. A.299. B.3: A.230. B.3.]</p>

<p>Sturt states that during this period Gawler three times offered him
the position of Colonial Secretary, Gouger being then ill.[8-14] Sturt
refused, as he thought Gouger deserved well of the Province [8-15] and
should be given time for recovery.</p>

<p class="ref">[8-14 Sturt papers: Letters to Darling, 25th Jan., 1843.]</p>

<p class="ref">[8-15 South Australian Register, 27th June, 1840.]</p>

<p>He was also, in 1840, offered the position of Manager for the South
Australian Company: this he refused. Gawler's lavish expenditure,
especially on the maintenance of immigrants, from public funds had
produced a reaction against him in England, and he was recalled. When
this was first known in Adelaide, in April, 1841, the colonists asked
Sturt to express on their behalf the universal respect felt for Colonel
Gawler, and in case that the Governor should be finally recalled to
urge his own claims to succeed him.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Sturt, on 30th April, 1841, addressed, with Gawler's
full approval, a memorial to Lord John Russell.</p>

<p>After stating that he had, personally, no feelings but those of
friendship and esteem for Grey, whom he had met "as man of similar
habits and pursuits ought to meet," he calls attention to the
embarrassment to older and more experienced officers which Grey's
appointment would cause. After further discussing the official aspects
he speaks of his personal interests. Referring first to the losses
incurred in accepting Gawler's offer of the Surveyor-General's post,
his subsequent supersession, and quoting evidence that he possesses the
confidence of the citizens, he concluded:</p>

<p>[8-16] I may without presumption assure Your Lordship that, in the
event of the loss of their present Governor, the Colonists would hail
with confidence and satisfaction my appointment as his successor.</p>

<p class="ref">[8-16 Life. p.204.]</p>

<p>"I take the liberty of candidly stating my feeling that if an
individual of ordinary rank is to fill this post, no one has greater
claims than myself.</p>

<p>"The appointment of Captain Grey, an officer much my junior in years
and of less experience, would place me as subordinate to him in a
situation which I could not but feel embarrassing and
humiliating...Although I have pressed my claims, I would assure Your
Lordship that Captain Grey, in the event of his arrival, shall receive
my best assistance."</p>

<p>But this letter had hardly left Adelaide when Grey arrived (15th
May, 1841) and proclaimed himself Governor.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX - The Period of Governor Grey</h2>

<p>[9-1] Soon after his arrival Grey stated that he did not feel
justified in paying to Sturt a higher salary than the &pound;400 per
annum which the Commissioners in their instructions had stated was the
salary which they had authorized to be paid to Sturt as Assistant
Commissioner and Registrar. Grey found that the office of Assistant
Commissioner was wholly unnecessary, and as no Registration Act had
passed the Council, there was no duty for a Registrar-General, so he
abolished that position. Grey was not, however, so unfeeling as the
above would suggest:</p>

<p class="ref">[9-1 Public Records Office, London. C.O. 13/31: 13/35.]</p>

<p>[9-2] Within two months after his arrival he placed before the
Legislative Council (24th July, 1841) *his finance minute and estimates
of expenditure for 1842. In those estimates he made provision for a
salary of &pound;600 for Sturt as Assistant Commissioner, placing upon
him the duty of controlling the supervision of pauper migrants whose
numbers had become excessive.</p>

<p class="ref">[9-2 Minutes of Council, 24th July, 1841.]</p>

<p>"Whilst it is necessary not to suffer actual destitution to exist,
which would only result in driving from the province labourers whose
service will, before long, be inadequate to the demand; it is also
requisite to guard against imposition, indolence, and combinations to
raise unduly the price of labour.</p>

<p>"These ends can only be obtained by giving, to some extent,
discretionary powers to an officer of rank, on whose judgment I can
rely."</p>

<p>In thus providing &pound;600 per annum for Sturt, Grey was careful
to advise him that this salary might not be sanctioned by the
authorities in England.</p>

<p>Sturt, however, did receive &pound;600 per annum all through 1842:
having been on a salary of &pound;400 presumably from May to December,
1841.</p>

<p>[9-3] Sturt stated in a letter to General Darling that Grey twice
offered him the position of Colonial Secretary, and when Sturt accepted
it, and the matter was apparently decided, Grey sent for him and told
him that the position would probably injure his vision and that someone
else would be approached.</p>

<p class="ref">[9-3 Sturt papers. Letter to Darling, 25th Jan., 1843.]</p>

<p>As soon as a Registration Act had been passed Grey appointed him
Registrar-General, and he ceased to be Assistant Commissioner. So
matters rested throughout 1842.</p>

<p>[9-4] In the meantime Sturt had built his house "Grange" on the Reed
Bed property, the house being on Section 901. The house was built in
either 1840 or 1841; and Sturt became busy with his garden, writing to
England and to his brother in India to send him seeds of all kinds,
even indigo and cotton.</p>

<p class="ref">[9-4 Information supplied by the Surveyor-General, S.A.]</p>

<p>His fourth child, a girl, was born at Grange, and at her christening
Eyre was one of the sponsors.</p>

<p>During this period Sturt rode into Adelaide every day and was
exceptionally busy in all kinds of public affairs. He was Chairman of
the Bench of Magistrates, and took an active part in the promotion of
all agricultural matters: and he was largely responsible for the
establishment at Moorundi on the Murray of a police force under Eyre as
Protector of Aborigines</p>

<p>Writing to his brother William on 9th April, 1842, he spoke of the
distress in the colony due to over-speculation, he spoke of his home
near the sea which had cost too much, of his cottage at East Terrace
which was still unsold, and he ended: "I shall probably never return to
England, nor should I now like English frost and snow."</p>

<p>In July, 1841, Sturt, as Trustee of Trinity Church, acknowledged a
donation of &pound;20 to church funds by Governor Grey.</p>

<p><b>Poole's Grave at Preservation Creek.</b></p>
</center>

<p>Matters went along quietly until January, 1843, when a climax
occurred. Grey received a reply from England on 21st December 1842, in
which, far from approving Grey's proposal to pay &pound;600 per annum,
he was directed to abolish the position of Assistant Commissioner. This
he did, leaving Sturt only the position of Registrar-General, to which
Grey attached the salary of &pound;400 per annum.</p>

<p>Sturt was moved immediately to prepare a memorial to the Lords of
the Treasury setting out in full the capricious treatment he had
received as it has been summarized above, and asking that they would
restore his salary to the &pound;600 level, or, if that could not be
granted, that the monetary sacrifices he had incurred should be to some
degree made good. He pointed out that he had had a considerably
property in New South Wales, that he did not seek any position in South
Australia, and would never have accepted a salary of &pound;400 if it
had been offered to him: although he would have been quite willing to
help Gawler temporarily.</p>

<p>This memorial was covered by a letter to the Secretary of State for
the Colonies (13th January, 1843) asking for that Minister's support in
the appeal which he had addressed to the Treasury, but added:</p>

<p>"If the prayer of that memorial cannot be accorded to me I would
entreat of your Lordship to remove me to some other Colony and to some
office more in unison with my past employment, or to move my Lords to
make good to me the sacrifices I have made and I will return to New
South Wales.</p>

<p>"I do not, my Lord, feel that I have deserved punishment at the
hands of Her Majesty's Government, nor can I think your Lordship will
permit such to be; I would disdain to press any inconsistent claim upon
your Lordship's attention.</p>

<p>"I have through life sacrificed my best interests to a reluctance to
apply even for that which would in all probability have been readily
accorded to me."</p>

<p>These two documents were forwarded to Grey through /Windy, the
Colonial Secretary: in the covering note asking that the documents be
forwarded, Sturt (14th January) stated that he had no alternative but
to accept the position of Registrar-General at &pound;400 per annum:
but he pointed out that he could not, on that salary, support the
standard of living necessary to a member of the Council, and returned
his Commission as a member; although he would, if the Governor wished,
continue to sit on the Council. He concluded this letter:</p>

<p>"Taking all the circumstances attending my residence in this
Province into consideration I 'cannot but express my deep regret that I
ever landed on its shores."</p>

<p>This was forwarded by Grey to Stanley on 28th January, 1843, and
referred by Stanley, Secretary of State for the Colonies, to the
Commissioners of Colonial Land and Emigration, who replied, reciting
events in the sense that has been given above: they added that while
actually Sturt had not received less than was legally due to him, they
readily admitted that he must have felt disappointed in the early loss
of his first situation in South Australia, and that there had been
something harassing though unavoidable in the various successive
changes of his subsequent appointments, and that, in the end, he had
fallen into a place below the pretentions of an officer of his rank and
reputation, and concluded:</p>

<p>"While therefore we cannot report that we consider him entitled to
compensation, we can only, on the other hand, leave to Lord Stanley's
indulgent consideration the petition which Captain Sturt prefers, that
His Lordship will take some opportunity of affording him promotion in
another Colony."</p>

<p>Stanley sent these papers on to Grey (12th October, 1843) with a
short note, which concluded:</p>

<p>"I agree with the Land and Emigration Commissioners in their view of
the claims of Captain Sturt to compensation. You will, therefore,
acquaint Captain Sturt that I am unable to accede to his
application."</p>

<p>There is, here, no reference to promotion in another colony, but it
has to be remembered that Stanley, had before him at this time Studs
offer to explore the whole continent, and may have considered this the
easier alternative.</p>

<p>A long delay of nine months from the time Sturt lodged his memorial
with the Governor to the decision given by Secretary of State, Stanley.
Sturt could not know of his decision before the following April: he
would have realized that this was so.</p>

<p>It is not, in all the circumstances, surprising that while making
his protest in January, 1843, he thought also of other possibilities.
From various letters written at the time his thoughts and feelings can
be imagined.</p>

<p>He had not been able to sell his cottage in East Terrace, and had
mortgaged his house at Grange; he had three sons to educate, the eldest
of whom was now in his seventh year; he was in his forty-eighth year,
and he could not face the future on &pound;400 a year.</p>

<p>"I would gladly retire from public life, but I cannot, I have played
my cards badly. If I had but &pound;300 a year I would retire from the
hateful scenes and thankless exertions of public life."</p>

<p>Apart from his personal worries he could see little prospect of
improvement in the fortunes of the Colony. Conceived as a theorist's
dream, nurtured by inexperienced officials, and directed by an
autocratic Governor with rigid efficiency, its economy was still
chaotic. As if this, locally, were not enough, it was subject to the
very remote but tight control of the authorities in England during a
confused period when colonial administration was in a stage of rapid
evolution, of which Sturt wrote:</p>

<p>"A beautiful place and climate, a loyal and industrious people,
Nature bountiful, but the Mother Country inexorable. Well! it is the
principle to cut early the cords of affection which bind the young
Colony to its parent: the policy of England has ever been to alienate
the affections of her dependencies."</p>

<p>And Carlyle, seven years later, 1850, wrote:</p>

<p>[9-5] "Every colony, every agent for a matter Colonial, has his
tragic tale to tell you of his sad experiences in the Colonial Office;
what blind obstructions, fatal indolences, pedantries, stupidities, on
the right and on the left, he had to do battle with."</p>

<p class="ref">[9-5 Carlyle: Latter Day pamphlets III.]</p>

<p>In all these troubles Sturt had the uncomfortable knowledge that
Mitchell, four years earlier, had been knighted, and given a D.C.L.
degree by Oxford University. Eyre's long journeys of exploration, too,
were still recent events. He turned again to the one field in which he
had distinguished himself and felt, as he had done in 1827, that if he
again succeeded in an enterprise of exploration he would "earn some
credit."</p>

<p>So he prepared a detailed proposal for an expedition into the
interior of Australia, and sent it off to Darling in England, asking
him to place it before Stanley: as he said he thought this might be one
way by which he could break out of his troubles.*</p>

<p>(* See Appendix D, Note 8.)</p>

<p>"I would make an effort to do that which added to what I have
already done would entitle me to the greater consideration of Her
Majesty's Government."</p>

<p>The mystery of the Centre, and the glitter of the "inland sea" were
still nagging at his mind.</p>

<p>Writing to Lady Darling at the same time as he wrote to Darling, he
said:6</p>

<p>[9-6] "I should like to put the finishing stroke to the career I
began in New South Wales by unfolding the secrets of the Interior, and
planting the ensign of my country in the centre of this mysterious
region: truly it is an object worthy to peril one's life for: I have
had a presentiment on my mind for years, that the task of exploring
central Australia would be mine, and we are often unconscious
instruments ourselves for the fulfilment of our allotted destinies. So
strong has this feeling been upon my mind that I did not for a moment
expect that Mr. Eyre would succeed in gaining the centre when he
undertook his last fearful journey."</p>

<p class="ref">[9-6 Sturt papers.]</p>

<p>Now began the long period of waiting. These letters were sent off in
January, 1843: no reply could be expected before, at the earliest,
November. Actually the replies were not received until May,
1844--fifteen months of anxious waiting.</p>

<p>During those fifteen months the relations between Grey and Sturt
were not happy.</p>

<p>[9-7] One incident, which is the only recorded occasion on which
Sturt made a slip in his official career, caused some friction between
himself and the Governor. It seems that Sturt wrote a letter to a firm
of building contractors: this letter contained expressions or
statements "which were very loose, and offered the opponents of
Government means, of which they have made use, to attempt to cast
discredit on the line pursued by the Government."</p>

<p class="ref">[9-7 Archiv. S.A. 895, No. 356. 787/1844/126, 127, 130.]</p>

<p>Had Sturt been a politician, or a more experienced public servant,
he would have been more careful about writing that letter.</p>

<p>As it was, he had to defend himself before the Executive Council,
and admit his mistake. This particular matter was a very protracted
affair in which Sturt's part was only incidental. But for his sensitive
mind it was very unpleasant. It was still actively under attention when
he left on his expedition in 1844, and was, even then, disturbing his
mind.</p>

<p>[9-8] Other matters indicate the growing tension between the two
men. Grey wrote on one occasion that embarrassments had arisen from a
too easy mode of conducting business in the Registrar-General's Office,
and asked that Sturt would for the future be "rigidly strict" in
business transactions.</p>

<p class="ref">[9-8 Archiv. S.A. 895, No. 356.]</p>

<p>[9-9] Sturt, during Gawler's administration, had arranged for the
engraving of maps of the new port. Grey refused to treat this debt as a
separate item and ruled that it must be included in the general debit
score of the colony. The correspondence continued over a long period,
the final issue not being clear, but it is evident that the incident
gave Sturt considerable worry.</p>

<p class="ref">[9-9 Archiv. S.A. G.(1844), 186.]</p>

<p>[9-10] The contractor for the building of the Adelaide Hospital took
legal action against Sturt and Gouger, as members of the Adelaide
Hospital Board, for the recovery of money due under the contract. The
correspondence between Grey and Sturt about this matter continued over
a considerable period. Sturt throughout maintained a dignified
attitude, making it clear that he, personally, had had nothing to do
with the contract for building the hospital. This correspondence ended
with a letter (23rd January, 1844) from Grey to Sturt assuring him "you
need not give yourself any anxiety over this matter." There were other
matters, but these indicate the general position. This is not the place
to discuss further the abnormal administrative arrangements under which
Sturt had to work, or the conditions surrounding Grey's appointment as
Governor. Whether Grey engineered Gawler's recall or not, he had a
difficult task. Whether he was unduly arrogant, domineering and harsh,
or not, he succeeded in his task--helped by the discovery of minerals
and natural agricultural evolution.</p>

<p class="ref">[9-10 Archiv. S.A. A.(1844), 1480 et al.]</p>

<p>But, without discussing these alternatives, it has to be recognized
that Sturt found himself beset with difficulties, and faced with those
administrative problems and occasions inevitable in all civil service,
under conditions adverse to that deliberate and peaceful solution by
personal discussion which is the daily routine of all normal civil
service.</p>

<p>Sturt was unhappy. He wrote to Darling (25th January, 1843):</p>

<p>"I occupy a position below what I have a right to expect...I believe
that Grey is jealous of my success and greater claims, but instead of
acting with generosity would lower me in the estimation of the
community."</p>

<p>But it should be noted that soon after his return from the Central
Australian Expedition Sturt wrote a long letter in the friendliest
terms to Grey, who was then in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Sturt's restraint and dignity, even his admission of an act of
indiscretion, are, under these circumstances, honourable to himself,
and gratifying to his admirers. It is good to know that his later years
in Adelaide were happier.</p>

<p>In January, 1844, by which time replies could have been expected to
the memorial and to his plan of exploration, Sturt naturally began to
speculate on the reasons for delay. He wrote to Darling on 5th March,
1844, stating that he had had a letter from Stanley saying that he was
waiting to hear from Darling. Sturt went on to detail the reasons he
had imagined why there should have been delay; and said:</p>

<p>[9-11] "It would be better for me to run the risk of allowing my
bones to blanch in the desert than to remain where I am without any
prospect of future advancement: I may yet live to make up by personal
exertion for the want of Fortune and may elevate myself to that
position amongst my friends in England from which my limited means have
hitherto kept me."</p>

<p class="ref">[9-11 Sturt papers.]</p>

<p>And he added the request that, if Stanley declined his proposal for
an expedition, Darling should support his claims to the position of
Colonial Treasurer in South Australia. In this letter he expressed the
belief that some very fine country remained to be discovered in central
Australia.</p>

<p>In April, 1844, he wrote to George Macleay that he was still
awaiting Stanley's reply: but this, at last, came in May, and Sturt was
informed by Grey that the expedition had been approved. There was no
word of promotion to a post in another Colony. The letter in May was,
however, a private letter to Grey from Stanley. Official advice was not
received until July. Sturt now began the preparations for his journey;
his last official act before his departure was to lodge an application
(15th August, 1844) the very day he left Adelaide on his long journey,
that he might be considered for the position of Colonial Treasurer
should it fall vacant during his absence, Gouger being then on leave on
account of ill-health, his condition being such that there was a
reasonable expectation that the position could soon be vacant.</p>

<p>Although this expedition led by Sturt had now been approved, it is
appropriate, before dealing in the next chapter with the expedition
itself, to discuss some related incidents.</p>

<p>Gipps, Governor of New South Wales, had written (7th December, 1843)
to Stanley. In this despatch he stated that in October, 1843, a
committee of the Legislative Council had been appointed to enquire into
the practicability of an overland route to Port Essington. Gipps added
that his desire to put in hand an expedition for this purpose had been
mentioned in his despatch on 28th September, 1840, and added:</p>

<p>[9-12] "Not long after the publication of that despatch I received
proposals for the undertaking from Captain Stuart and Mr. Eyre,
gentlemen already distinguished in the field of Australian
discovery.</p>

<p>"Your Lordship will, however, perceive by the evidence of Sir Thomas
Mitchell, that that officer not only considers the project a
practicable one, but is himself ready to lead the Expedition."</p>

<p class="ref">[9-12 H.R.A. XVIII 245.] [9-12 Public Records Office, London. C.O.
201/340.]</p>

<p>There was no "Stuart," Captain or other, at that time who could be
called a distinguished explorer: there is little doubt that Sturt and
Eyre had each made an offer: "Further light is thrown upon this by a
letter written by Deas Thomson to E. J. Eyre (17th November, 1841).
Eyre had written to Governor Gipps offering to conduct an expedition
from Moreton Bay to Port Essington. Thomson replied that Gipps:</p>

<p>"will be happy to avail himself of your services...provided no prior
claim be preferred by Captain Sturt, with whom His Excellency has had
some communication on the subject."</p>

<p>It is to be noted that Sturt made this offer in 1841, at a time
which must have been very shortly after Grey's arrival.</p>

<p>The far horizon was still calling;* and Mitchell was still himself.
In 1844 Eyre must have written again to Gipps repeating his proposal to
lead an expedition to Port Essington.</p>

<p>(*The offer made to Hay in 1834 should be remembered. See p.
69.)</p>

<p>Gipps wrote again to Stanley (24th October, 1844): after referring
to Eyre's letter and to his own previous despatch, Gipps concluded:</p>

<p>[9-13] "Not having received an answer to that despatch, I regret
that I can at present add little to what is contained in it, though I
repeat that in the event of an expedition being undertaken to Port
Essington, I apprehend Sir Thomas Mitchell will claim (as, indeed, he
has already claimed) the honour of conducting it.</p>

<p>"A small private expedition is now on the point of starting from
Moreton Bay to Port Essington direct. Dr. Leichhardt is, I believe, a
physician, a German by birth, and a man of considerable scientific
attainments."</p>

<p class="ref">[9-13 H.R.A. XXIV. 50.]</p>

<p>It should be noted, for the sake of historical accuracy, that
Leichhardt was neither a physician nor a man of scientific attainments.
There is still another document of interest. Eyre wrote from Moorundi
to Stanley, dated 22nd August, 1844, to the effect that Grey had
informed him that Stanley had nominated him, Eyre, to the command of
the expedition if any circumstance had prevented Sturt from taking part
in it.* Eyre said he would be glad to accept if anything happened to
Sturt, but rejoiced that Sturt was, himself, to lead the expedition. He
continued:</p>

<p>(*Grey had been so informed officially from Downing Street in a
letter dated 22nd March, 1844 (Pub. Rec. Off. C.O. 201/340).)</p>

<p>[9-14] "I am unwillingly forced to the conviction that the great
mass of the interior of New Holland consists of salt beds of extensive
lakes, barren scrubs or desert sands. In expressing so strongly the
opinion that I have, I am well aware that it is totally at variance
with that entertained by my friend on the same subject. With every
deference for the opinion of so intelligent and experienced a traveller
as Captain Sturt, I must confess that I cannot, after the most
attentive consideration of the character and formation of this
continent, see any data from which to infer either the existence of a
fine country in the parallel of 23 degrees S. Lat. and north of
Spencer's Gulf, or of a deep inland sea, west of the Darling in 28
degrees or 29 degrees S.</p>

<p>"My own personal experience leads me to quite the contrary
conclusion; but the expedition now in progress under Captain Sturt will
in a few months solve this question."</p>

<p class="ref">[9-14 H.R.A. XXIV. 51.]</p>

<p>If this letter is correctly dated, it was written by Eyre while
Sturt was his guest at Moorundi on the first stage of the outward
journey of his great Central Australian Expedition. Did these two men
thrash out their differences in fruitless discussion, or were they
courteously reserved?</p>

<p>[9-15] This is the place to refer to two other letters both written
by Sturt to P. P. King. The first was written on 5th December, 1843,
while he was still awaiting news from London; from it the following
extracts are taken:</p>

<p class="ref">[9-15 Letters in the possession of the late Dr. H. 0. Lethbridge, of
Narrandera: copies kindly supplied by Mrs. Lethbridge.]</p>

<p>"You will, I imagine, recognize my signature with some suspicion. I
feel assured that, if no personal regard influenced you, the topic I am
about to touch would sufficiently excuse me to you. I observe by the
Sydney papers that a Committee has been engaged in enquiries as to an
overland route to Port Essington. The conclusions at which the
Committee has arrived are in my judgment erroneous, and I think it is
to be regretted that they did not refer to you and to Mr. Hume for
better information than they would probably obtain from Sir Thomas
Mitchell, whose opinion, I assure you, I hold in the most sovereign
contempt.</p>

<p>"I have written to Lord Stanley (offering to lead an expedition to
the interior): will you give me your opinion on these matters and such
suggestions as your great knowledge of the Coast will enable you to
make...(He then asks King to send him some seeds and adds) I send you a
few seeds of the best Portugal indigo from my brother."</p>

<p>The second letter was dated 11th August, 1844, four days before he
left Adelaide on this expedition. From this letter short extracts are
taken:</p>

<p>"I have organized an expedition which left Adelaide yesterday. The
object of Her Majesty's Government is to ascertain the supposed
existence of a chain of hills running from N.E. to S.W. of the
continent. I am directed to go due north of Mount Arden, and in order
to effect this I must run to the eastward to Mount Lyell and try to
turn Lake Torrens to the west. If I cannot do this I shall run up the
Darling and try parallel movements at every thirty miles.</p>

<p>"I am told that if I am forced to the eastward so far I may proceed
to Moreton Bay, so do not be surprised if one fine day I pounce in upon
you. Believe me with sincere regards. Your faithful and sincere
friend."</p>

<p>The letter from King (see Ch 8: "Sturt has just been appointed...")
to Mitchell on 3rd February, 1839, will be remembered. One further
letter should be recorded. Frome had written to Grey on 21st June
asking that he might lead the expedition if Sturt could not, for any
reason, do so. Grey replied:</p>

<p>[9-16] "I consider Captain Frome's...offer as extremely creditable
to himself--the imperfect acquaintance which I at present have
regarding the views of the Government relative to this expedition
prevent me from doing more than promising to put Captain Frome's
application on record."</p>

<p class="ref">[9-16 Archiv. S.A.]</p>

<p>This series of letters provide interesting glimpses of five
explorers--Sturt, Grey, King, Eyre and Frome.</p>

<p>Sturt, in putting forward his proposals for this expedition, had
submitted two ideas which were mutually inconsistent; from the flight
of migratory birds he was convinced that there was, somewhere in the
centre of the continent, and north of Mt. Arden, a fine country to
which these birds went: on the other hand, he held the opinion that the
interior was occupied by a sea of greater or less extent, and very
probably by large tracts of desert country. He felt that this problem
should be settled.</p>

<p>Sturt had available the knowledge gained by Eyre who, travelling
northwards from Adelaide along the western face of the main range, had,
after ascending Mt. Serle and Mt. Hopeless, been stopped by Lake
Torrens, which, in a semi-circle from near Spencer's Gulf round to the
east of Mt. Hopeless, seemed to prevent further movement northward.</p>

<p>In his letter to Stanley (January, 1843) Sturt had offered to
explore the whole continent.</p>

<p>[9-17] Some extracts from the correspondence are of interest. Iii
his proposal to Stanley, sent through Darling, Sturt said:</p>

<p class="ref">[9-17 Public Records Office, London. C.O. 13/35.]</p>

<p>"My Lord, with &pound;4,000...and left to organize my own party, and
to take the course which experience assures me is the only one likely
to be successful, I would engage, natural and unconquerable obstacles
excepted, to traverse the Australian continent from east to west and
from north to south in two years."</p>

<p>The comment by Sir John Barrow was rather caustic:</p>

<p>"The plan proposed by Mr. Sturt appears to comprehend a great deal
more than he or any other human being could by any possibility
accomplish in two years, or in any number of years on one continued
expedition."</p>

<p>Stanley decided to approve an expedition of more limited range, and
his instructions concerning the expedition were based on a northerly
course from Mt. Arden. But he recognized also the necessity for
deciding whether there was about the 28th parallel of latitude a
watershed running north-east to south-west: and he limited the scope of
the expedition to determining the existence of such a watershed,
examining any rivers which rose in such mountains, and, generally, to
ascertaining the nature of the country in that region.</p>

<p>Sturt was allowed the option of returning via Moreton Bay if he was
forced so far to the eastward as to make that an easier route than
following the Darling would be; but any attempt to continue northwards
to the mouths of the great rivers in the tropical regions was
absolutely prohibited.</p>

<p>Sturt considered these instructions but decided that, in view of
Eyre's experience, he was justified in discarding a route northwards
from Mt. Arden, and decided to follow the Darling up to Laidley's
Ponds,* the point at which Mitchell had left it in 1835.</p>

<p>(*Lakes Menindie and Cawndilla.)</p>

<p>On 31st July, Grey transmitted official instructions to Sturt
concerning the expedition. These instructions outlined the objects of
the expedition as stated above, instructing Sturt that he was always to
retain the south as his base; that an amount of &pound;2,500 had been
approved; and that the expedition was not intended to last more than
twelve months. The instructions concluded:</p>

<p>"You have already been made so fully acquainted with the views with
which Her Majesty's Government have fitted out this expedition, and
your past experience in the conduct of explorations in this country has
been so great, that any detailed instructions regarding the conduct of
the expedition would be superfluous, and the same reasons render it
unnecessary to furnish you with any directions regarding geographical
or scientific observations."</p>

<p>All these preliminaries disposed of, a new episode in Sturt's life
was about to begin; and, although he did not know it, his troubles in
Adelaide were over; his life after his return was to be much
easier.</p>

<p>When he arrived back in Adelaide in February, 1846, Grey was no
longer there.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X - The Central Australian
Expedition</h2>

<p><b>A.--TO DEPOT GLEN</b></p>

<p>There was no delay in the arrangements. The party was assembled, and
consisted of:</p>

<pre>
Charles Sturt as Leader.
James Poole, assistant to Sturt.
John Harris Browne, Surgeon.
McDouall Stuart, Draughtsman.
Louis Piesse, Storekeeper.
Robert Flood.
Hugh Foulkes.

</pre>

<p>[10-1] The last eleven men were all required to sign an
agreement--the text of which is printed as an Appendix (Appendix C.) to
this volume. The spelling of the names is taken from this agreement and
is presumably correct, notwithstanding variations found in other
records. This agreement is dated 9th August, 1844. Sturt endeavoured to
obtain the services of Thomas Burr, of the Surveyor-General's staff,
but was refused.</p>

<p class="ref">[10-l Archiv. S.A. C.S.O. 901&frac12; of 1844.]</p>

<p>Later he engaged Stuart, but there is a note in the archives that
this was done "without authority."</p>

<p>Sturt also sought approval to take two sappers and miners from the
military staff under Frome's command, but this was refused.</p>

<p>Also he sought to have remission of Customs duties on the tobacco
bought for the expedition, but Grey replied that such remission was
beyond his powers.</p>

<p>[10-2] The men received one pound per week and rations; Poole
&pound;200 per annum; Harris Browne &pound;150.</p>

<p class="ref">[10-2 Archiv. S.A. G.(1845) 949: L.(1845) 24: A.(1846) 82: L.(1846)
133, 134.]</p>

<p>Sturt, as leader, was paid &pound;500 per annum, and was also paid
half-pay during his absence from his civil service post.</p>

<p>Miss Cooper, sister to his friend Judge Cooper, and Miss Conway
(afterwards Mrs. Bartley and Mrs. Nicholls respectively) had worked a
Union Jack for Sturt to take with him. Both this flag and that which he
had with him on the Murray expedition, are in the Art Gallery,
Adelaide. In a letter of thanks to Miss Cooper (7th August, 1844) he
said:</p>

<p>[10-3] "I go to this task for the good of those I hold dear: I care
nothing for myself, and would take a last farewell of my wife and
children if it were for their good."</p>

<p class="ref">[10-3 Original letter in Archiv. S.A.]</p>

<p>The departure of the party was fixed for 10th August, and the
citizens of Adelaide gave a public "breakfast" as a send-off for the
party. To this function Sturt took his eldest son, Napier.</p>

<p>[10-4] The Chairman, Major O'Halloran, in his speech wishing the
expedition success said, speaking of Sturt:</p>

<p class="ref">[10-4 Adelaide Register, 14th Aug., 1844.]</p>

<p>"He retains all the vigour and energy of his younger days. Who among
us can boast of warmer and more attached admirers: he is deservedly
loved and respected by us all."</p>

<p>Sturt, in his reply, said that glory and honour attend the death of
a hero, but there was no glory like that of falling in the endeavour to
benefit our fellow-men.</p>

<p>After the breakfast "the well-loaded drays, one carrying a boat,
were ranged in order in King William Street," and attended by the whole
breakfast company, moved off over the bridge, through North Adelaide to
Dry Creek, where the procession broke up, the company returning to
town.</p>

<p>Sturt remained behind, with Davenport,* to finish up some private
business, and left Adelaide on 15th August.</p>

<p>(*Davenport was with Sturt from the beginning of the journey in
Adelaide.)</p>

<p>The story of this expedition, which lasted for eighteen months,
cannot be told here in any detail. It is an epic story which should be
read as Sturt told it in his Narrative of an Expedition to Central
Australia. It is not possible to do more in this volume than to give a
brief summary.</p>

<p>The whole party assembled at Moorundi on the Murray, where Eyre was
stationed as Protector of Aborigines.</p>

<p>[10-5] The movements of the main party can be traced. They reached
Dry Creek late in the afternoon of 10th August and camped there till
the morning of 12th. They reached the Little Para on the evening of
12th, Gawler on 13th, Nuriootpa on 14th, and Angaston on 16th
August.</p>

<p class="ref">[10-5 These details were compiled by Mr. G. H. Pitt after reference
to the actual diaries of Sturt and Browne--they are to be found in
pp.25-28 of reprint attached to Vol. 44 of the Proceedings of the Royal
Geog. Soc., S.A. Branch--in the S.A. Archives.]</p>

<p>From Angaston the route lay N.N.E. to a point near Truro, where it
turned eastwards for the Murray. On 17th August the party passed the
White Hut two miles east of Truro on Section 207 Hundred of Jellicoe:
it is now called Schillings Gate: on the same day they passed the Dust
Hole, which is on Section 107 Hundred of Jellicoe--now known as
McBean's Station: the main party reached Moorundi on 18th August, Sturt
having joined them on the way. Here Eyre "altogether superior to any
unworthy feeling of jealousy assisted us with efforts as ceaseless as
they were disinterested."</p>

<p>Eyre had, not long before, travelled up the Darling to Mitchell's
last camp at Laidley's Ponds, and gave Sturt all the information he
had.</p>

<p>The expedition's outfit consisted of:</p>

<pre>
11 horses.
30 bullocks.
1 boat and boat carriage.
1 horse dray.
1 spring cart.
3 drays.
</pre>

<p>In addition there were 200 sheep for food, two sheep dogs, and four
kangaroo dogs. All the stores were repacked, and when all preparations
were complete the party moved off on 19th August. Sturt addressed the
men, and, having told them they were commencing a journey from which
none of them could tell who would be permitted to return, read a few
appropriate prayers.</p>

<p>The drays then moved off:</p>

<p>"I watched it with an anxiety which made me forgetful of everything
else, and I naturally turned my thoughts to the future. How many of
those who had just passed me so full of hope and in such exuberant
spirits, would be permitted to return to their homes? Should I, their
leader, be one of those destined to remain in the desert or should I be
more fortunate in treading it than the persevering and adventurous
officer whose guest I was, and who shrank from the task I had
undertaken."</p>

<p>Here, as on each of his previous journeys, were Sturt's melancholy
forebodings--this time fully justified.</p>

<p>It is, however, difficult to imagine the state of mind in which
Sturt wrote the last sentence quoted above.</p>

<p><b>Moorundi to Menindie<br>
19th August--10th October</b></p>

<p>From Moorundi they followed the Murray as far as the point where the
Anabranch of the Darling joined that river. Following up the Anabranch
for about 15-20 miles they turned eastward to the Darling itself,
following this up round the eastward bend at Pooncarie, noting the
Burtundy Rocks. The New South Wales Lands Department map of 1933 shows
"Sturt's Billabong" about the point of Sturt's first contact with the.
Darling, although Sturt does not mention any such feature.</p>

<p>A sudden flooding of the Darling on 29th September made Sturt think
that there had been local flooding of the streams coming from the
ranges to the north-west of Laidley's Ponds.</p>

<p>While they were at Lake Victoria on this outward journey Sturt
received information from a native of the Menindie tribe that an
overland party had been attacked by the natives, and the whole party,
fifteen .in number, had been killed.</p>

<p>Sturt advised Grey of this, adding that the information indicated
that this had occurred five nights previously, and he asked that Mrs.
Sturt might be advised of his safety, and asked Grey to: "allay her
fears, as she has suffered enough in this painful separation without
additional and unnecessary anxiety."</p>

<p>The Colonial Secretary of New South Wales was advised of the report,
and Eyre at Moorundi was instructed (9th October) that five mounted
police with pack horses would be left at Moorundi until 25th October
"in case anything should happen to Captain Sturt."</p>

<p>On reaching Menindie, Sturt found that the incident referred to was
actually the Mitchell incident of nine years before: although he had
written to Eyre from Lake Victoria (Sept. 17th), "I think there is no
doubt of the leading facts being true."</p>

<p><b>Menindie to Flood Creek<br>
11th October to 10th December</b></p>

<p>At this stage it should be mentioned that there are two original
sources from which the route of the expedition after it left Menindie
can be traced.</p>

<p>The first is a chart in the Lands Department in Adelaide which is
labelled "Chart of the country explored by the Central Australian
Expedition under the command of Captain Charles Sturt: Tracing by
Richard Counsel, May, 1846."</p>

<p>There are two points to be noted: Counsel was one of those who
presented the vase to Sturt in 1839: and the tracing was made three
months after Sturt's return to Adelaide, and must have been done either
under the supervision of, or in consultation with, Sturt himself: This
will be referred to, if reference is necessary, as the "Counsel
tracing."</p>

<p>The second source is the Arrowsmith map: this is labelled "Map of
Captain Sturt's route from Adelaide into the centre of Australia
constructed from his original protractions and other official
documents." It was prepared by the cartographer, Arrow-smith, in
London, and is dated 1849.</p>

<p>Mention should also be made of the booklet published as a Centenary
souvenir in 1944 by the Barrier Field Naturalists' Club: this volume
contains information compiled by E. B. Dow, who took great trouble to
identify the places visited by Sturt in the Broken Hill region.</p>

<p>Sturt spent two months in the Barrier Range area.</p>

<p>Having first satisfied himself to his great disappointment that
there was no great range and no large mountain stream leading eastward
into the Darling, he began short scouting journeys from a base camp at
Lake Cawndilla. He first sent Poole and Stuart to Scrope Range to the
north. These returned and reported that, between that range and the
range to the west (Barrier Range) there was a large body of water like
an immense lake: they did not think they could have been deceived by
mirage.</p>

<p>Sturt sent back despatches to the Governor, and letters to others.
He wrote:</p>

<p>"We seem on the high road to success with mountains and seas before
us...it will be a joyous day for us to launch on an unknown sea, and
run away towards the tropics."</p>

<p>[10-6] Both Eyre and Grey doubted this, believing that Sturt had
been deceived by mirage, and Mrs. Sturt wrote:</p>

<p class="ref">[10-6 R.G.S.S.A. IV.127.]</p>

<p>"This report is not from my Charley's observation of the distant
country, but from that of his assistant, Mr. Poole. No one here expects
news of a good country. Nothing but desert for my beloved to toil
through; and no water to ease his labours."</p>

<p>She was a good prophet.</p>

<p>Then he led a party himself and spent seven days following up
Stephen Creek, mentioning Murnco Murnco (Munka Munka), Curnapaga
(probable Nine-mile creek), Parnari (the rocky water-hole immediately
below the bridge where the railway to Sydney crosses Stephen Creek
before reaching the Gorge Siding), and Yanco Glen (not the place now
bearing this name, but farther along Yancowinna Creek).</p>

<p>Moving the whole camp to Parnari, Sturt then explored the range,
visiting Mt. Darling, Mt. Gipps and Mt. Bourke: it is doubtful whether,
at any time, they moved across the actual site of the present town of
Broken Hill.</p>

<p>At this point Sturt gave to this range the name "Stanley's Barrier
Range."</p>

<p>From 5th to 8th November was spent in seeking, and finding, a route
over the ranges so that Sturt might follow the north-westerly course on
which he had concentrated from the beginning and which was to place him
north of Mt. Arden.*</p>

<p>(*Mt. Arden is 30 miles north of Port Augusta.)</p>

<p>They found a route by following Stephen Creek to the junction of
Nine-mile creek, then along its northward course into the hills,
passing Parnell Creek, the seven-mile well, past Lewis Hill (which they
climbed) on to the watershed between Stephen, Yancowinna and Purnamoota
Creeks. Crossing this watershed they reached the headwaters of
Purnamoota Creek and followed this down till they found a pool. Below
this pool the bed of the Purnamoota Creek became impassable owing to
large boulders, so they turned up a spur which led them westerly on to
the plains of Mundi Mundi close to the present Soapstone Creek. From
here they travelled northwards along the base of the scarp till they
found good water at the "Gorge of the Glen," where Campbell Creek
issues from the ranges on the plains.</p>

<p>If Arrowsmith's map is to be taken as a guide they were, on Campbell
Creek, not very far from Torrowangee, as that map shows plainly that
this "Rocky Glen" is at the junction of the southern and north-western
branches of Campbell Creek, or some four miles south-west of
Torrowangee.</p>

<p>[10-7] While in this region the men gave the name of Piesse's Knob
to one of the hills, it is now accepted that this hill (although shown
on the Arrowsmith map as south of Stephen Creek) is part of the ridge
known as the Razorback.</p>

<p class="ref">[10-7 Information supplied by the Under-Secretary, Lands Department,
N.S.W.]</p>

<p>From Campbell Creek Sturt, Browne and Flood scouted north-west
finding Morphett Creek a little to the west (about five miles) of the
present Corona homestead. Experiencing extreme heat and finding no
water they were forced to return.</p>

<p>The next move of the main party was to Morphett Creek, and while
this move was slowly taking place, Sturt sent Poole and Browne off
again to the north-west with instructions to attempt to reach Lake
Torrens "or any body of water of unknown extent," and to determine
whether any westerly course was open to the main party. If their water
supply was to fail they were to return at once to camp. If they
discovered any extensive sheet of water they were to "return
immediately to the camp, as, in the event of our requiring the boat
many necessary preparations will have to be made."</p>

<p>Nine days later they returned after an exhausting journey, having to
travel at night because of the heat.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="ill-58"></a><img alt="" src="0700391h-images/sturt-51.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Route North from Broken Hill.</b></p>
</center>

<p>They had reached the channel between Lakes Callabonna and Frome,
where the Yandama Creek discharges, and had sighted across the lake
three remarkable peaks similar to those marked down by Eyre. This was
good observation, for they had reached the Lake Torrens of Eyre, and
were within forty miles of Mt. Hopeless.</p>

<p>This decided the question of a route to the west, so Sturt sent
Flood scouting to the north; he returned reporting a beautiful creek
with abundant grass and water--Flood Creek.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="ill-59"></a><img alt="" src="0700391h-images/sturt-52.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Portion of Counsel Tracing.</b></p>
</center>

<p>So, having checked and reloaded the stores and reduced the
rations--tea from 4 oz. to 3 oz. and sugar from 2 lb. to 1&frac12; lb.
per week--the whole party moved on to Flood Creek.</p>

<p>The reloading of the stores rendered one of the lighter vehicles
unnecessary and the horse cart was abandoned at Morphett Creek. Sturt
sometimes refers to this as "horse cart creek."</p>

<p>Tietkens when in the district in 1860 was told that the remains of
this cart had been found several miles lower down the creek.</p>

<p><b>Flood Creek to Depot Glen<br>
10th December to 27th January</b></p>

<p>The camp at Flood Creek was, probably, about ten miles to the
south-east of Mt. Westwood homestead: of this, however, there is no
certainty. While at this camp Sturt sent Poole and Browne scouting
north: they passed Mt. Arrowsmith, which they climbed, and continued
slightly to the east of north, finishing about fifteen miles east of
Tibooburra. They returned reporting an abundance of water in Evelyn
Creek, and a large pool of water half-way at Packsaddle Creek.</p>

<p>While they were away, Sturt, with Stuart and Flood, travelled
eastwards across the great plain where the Fowler's Gap Hotel was later
located, crossing the plain very close to the Sandy Creek Bore. On this
journey they reached the Nuntherungie ranges at Mt. Lyell, returning to
Flood Creek on a more northerly route, passing very close to the
southern end of Lake Bancannia without seeing it.</p>

<p>It is to be noted how careful Sturt was never to move forward from
water till he had located an adequate supply at the next point
forward.</p>

<p>Sturt climbed the Pinnacle, the highest and last point of the
Barrier Range. Here his reflections were serious:</p>

<p>"We stood, as it were, in the centre of the barrenness: we were
gradually and steadily working our way into the interior: I had hoped
by this time, with God's blessing we should have raised the veil that
had so long hung over it."</p>

<p>They had been out already four months, and had made little real
progress. The party's consumption of water was over 1,000 gallons per
day, the horses and bullocks requiring large quantities. The journey
from Flood Creek to Evelyn Creek was at first extremely difficult
through pine forest and over ridges of sand: this stage gave Sturt, as
leader, great anxiety. They would pass close to The Veldt and Yelka
homesteads, reaching Packsaddle Creek probably not far from Pimpara
homestead.</p>

<p>At their camp on Packsaddle Creek Sturt noticed the first signs of
Poole's illness; he was complaining of great pain.</p>

<p>Leaving Packsaddle Creek their route was northwards, making a bend
eastwards to near Boullia homestead, then north-westerly to near Mt.
Shannon homestead, and again north-easterly past Mt. Browne homestead
to Evelyn Creek, which they reached four miles below its junction with
Preservation Creek, and seven miles below the entrance of the Gorge
from which that creek emerges. This would place their camp very close
to the present village of Milparinka.</p>

<p>It might here be noted that, in moving from Flood Creek to Evelyn
Creek, they had crossed through the break in the watershed, so that
they were now again on the east side of the range which is, except for
this gap, almost continuous from Central Queensland to Broken Hill. It
was, in fact, the very range which Sturt went out to find: although he
would, at that stage, have ridiculed such a suggestion.</p>

<p>At Evelyn Creek they paused for ten days while Sturt, Browne and
Flood scouted northward. Sturt passed Wittabrinna Creek, McDonald Peak,
and pushed northward over the plains, diverging to the west to examine
Stokes Range. From the top of Stokes Range:</p>

<p>"A dark and gloomy sea of scrub without a break in its monotonous
surface met our gaze. I could not but think from the appearance of the
country as far as we had gone that we could not be very far from the
outskirts of an inland sea, it so precisely resembled a low and barren
sea coast. This idea I may say haunted me, and it was the cause of my
making a second journey to the same locality."</p>

<p>On the return journey to the base camp they camped one night on
Frome Creek, noting its westerly trend. On this journey they suffered
greatly from flies by day and ants by night.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="ill-60"></a><img alt="" src="0700391h-images/sturt-53.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Route North from Milparinka.</b></p>
</center>

<p>On Sturt's return to the camp Poole reported that, farther up Evelyn
Creek, he had found a long, deep sheet of water above which there was a
rocky glen containing successive pools in rocky basins, in which he
considered there was an inexhaustible supply of water.</p>

<p>He had found the "Depot Glen" (Preservation Creek), to which they
moved on 27th January.</p>

<p><b>B.-AT DEPOT GLEN<br>
27th January to 16th July</b></p>

<p>They could not camp in the gorge, so they made camp on the creek a
quarter-of-a-mile below its mouth. They were doomed to remain there for
six months; the water in the creeks was drying up, and after running
down every creek and scouting in all directions they realized that they
reached the only spot where there was water for their needs. If this
place had not been found they would have had to make a forced retreat
to the Darling, however difficult that might be.</p>

<p>Now illness began to show itself among the men: Sturt himself had
the first signs of scurvy.</p>

<p>As soon as the camp was settled Sturt and Poole scouted twenty miles
to the west, but had to return, as Poole became ill and Sturt had
difficulty in getting him back to camp.</p>

<p>Sturt then made that second trip to the north. He continued
northwards past Wittabrinna Creek, McDonald peak, and passed on
northwards through country that was mostly sand and spinifex, "in one
of the most gloomy regions that man ever traversed."</p>

<p>Their course was roughly parallel to, and about twenty miles west
of, Warn Warri Creek, although there is no evidence that they touched
that creek anywhere.</p>

<p>It is impossible to determine exactly where he was when he turned
back, although from distances shown on Arrowsmith's map he had reached
28 degrees 10 minutes S. (he placed his own position as about a mile
beyond the 28th parallel), and must have been only about 20-25 miles
south of the Wilson River, at a point about 20 miles south-west of the
junction of that river with the Warri Warri Creek. He recorded that he
had hoped to have advanced some 60 miles beyond this point; had he done
so he would have come near to the point on Cooper Creek which he
reached nine months later.</p>

<p>They must have passed through Binnera Downs, Naryilco and Yanko
stations: on the return journey they followed Frome Creek westward to
Lake Pinnaroo, where, later, they were to establish Fort Grey
Depot.</p>

<p><b>Title-page of book presented to Sturt's son, Charles.</b></p>
</center>

<p>On this journey they were in extreme difficulties about water, the
creeks drying rapidly, and the heat was so great as to be
distressing--the horse they had with them "trying to get his own nose
into the bung-holes of the casks and imploring for relief as much as an
animal could do by looks."</p>

<p>They returned to the camp at Preservation Creek with the knowledge
that they could not move till rain came. He estimated that he was more
than 250 miles from the Darling (the actual distance to Bourke is 270
miles, to Wilcannia about 160: he could not know of the Paroo or the
Warrego) and he knew that he could not hope to reach it at that
advanced stage of summer, with the clear evidence that the country was
rapidly drying. He decided to stay quietly at the camp, trusting to
Providence to "release me from prison when He thought best."</p>

<p>But he did not exactly sit down quietly. He made a long
reconnaissance to the east, first following Evelyn Creek down to about
One-tree water hole then south to the Cobham Lakes area, then east,
noting the Bulloo overflow, to a point which was probably somewhere
near the Bootra homestead.</p>

<p>On this journey to the east he noted "mesembryanthemum of a new
variety, with flowers on a long slender stalk, heaps of which had been
gathered by natives for seed."</p>

<p>This is probably the first reference to "nardoo," which subsequently
became so well-known in connection with the Burke and Wills
Expedition.</p>

<p>At the time of this journey to the east it became clear that Poole,
Browne and Sturt himself all had clear signs of scurvy: Poole was the
worst sufferer and gradually declined in health. Their situation was
bad; they were shut in for an indefinite period; the leaders were all
suffering from scurvy; and the heat was intense.</p>

<p>Sturt's description of the conditions at this depot on Preservation
Creek has often been quoted. Because the ink dried on their pens as
they were writing they dug an underground room, roofing it with logs
covered with turf. Every screw in their boxes became loose, the horn
handles of their instruments and their combs split into fine laminae;
the lead dropped out of their pencils, and they had to bury their wax
candles. Their hair, and the wool on the sheep, ceased to grow; the
flour lost more than eight per cent. of its original weight.</p>

<p>These intolerable conditions had to be endured from 27th January to
12th July, when the rain came at last: it is true that, as the summer
faded, the temperatures became lower, but the enforced inactivity was
extremely depressing: and they watched the water in the creek shrink
from its original depth of nine feet to a narrow line in the centre of
the channel.</p>

<p>"Almost heart-broken Mr. Browne and I seldom left our tents save to
visit our sick companion."</p>

<p>Twice, hearing thunder to the west, Sturt set out in that direction
to see whether they could move on; but was forced back each time.</p>

<p>Poole's illness had been steadily getting worse. By the end of April
his muscles were attacked and he was suffering great pain. From then
onwards he did not leave his bed. In May his condition deteriorated
rapidly and he was unable to eat. They had been away much longer than
had been expected and the question of supplies became pressing. Sturt
decided to send some of the men back with Poole the moment the rains
came, and began to get everything ready.</p>

<p>Poole at this time made the suggestion that it would keep the men
busy if they erected stone cairns on Red Hill (Mt. Poole) and Mt.
Browne. This was done.</p>

<p>"I little thought that I was erecting Mr. Poole's monument, but so
it was; that rude structure overlooks his lonely grave, and will stand
for ages as a record of all we suffered in the dreary region to which
we were so long confined."</p>

<p>The cairn of stones on Mt. Poole was 21 feet at the base, and
eighteen feet high: it is not now so high.</p>

<p>The months of May and June passed with no change in the weather
other than that it became bitterly cold.</p>

<p>About the middle of June, Sturt, believing that the drought could
not continue much longer, set about his preparations for departure. He
sent Stuart to chain a route towards Lake Pinnaroo, and had all the
carts put into serviceable condition. He divided the provisions, and
had one dray prepared as an ambulance for Poole, lined with sheepskins
and with a flannel tilt.</p>

<p>He prepared despatches for the Governor asking that supplies be sent
to Menindie as he intended to proceed westward "in the hope of finding
Lake Torrens connected with some more extensive and more central body
of water."</p>

<p>At the end of June the prospect of removal seemed as distant as
ever. Poole became worse, and was moved to the underground room, a
chimney having been built in it so that a fire could keep him warm.</p>

<p>July opened with every appearance of rain and, on 12th July, the
rain began, continuing heavily until the morning of the 14th, when the
home party, under the nominal leadership of Poole, was mustered for
departure.</p>

<p>Browne went with them for the first day.</p>

<p>On 16th July Sturt started off for Fort Grey, Browne having returned
and reported that Poole was in tolerable spirits with every hope of
gradual improvement.</p>

<p>At the end of the first day's journey, however, Sturt's party was
overtaken by one of the men, who reported that Poole had died suddenly
when about to take some medicine: Sturt supposed some internal
haemorrhage occurred.</p>

<p>Poole's body was brought back to the depot; the whole party
assembled there on 17th July, and Poole was buried under a grevillea
tree which stood close to the underground room. In the tree were cut
"J.P.1845" and, as Sturt said: "he now sleeps in the desert." The tree
is still alive, but by 1863 the underground room had been completed
silted up.</p>

<p>Many years ago Mr. Alexander Lang had a cement pillar erected on
which was the inscription: "To the memory of John Poole, second in
command of Sturt's exploring party, died here on the 16th July,
1845."</p>

<p>Two errors are obvious--the spelling of "second" which is still as
it was, and Poole's first name should have been James. Mr. E. B. Dow
visited Mt. Poole in 1935 and altered the name as seen in the
photograph.</p>

<p>An area of one acre, including the grave, has been gazetted as a
permanent reserve by the New South Wales Government. After Poole's
death, Piesse was placed in command of the home party with instructions
to bring relief supplies to Menindie: this he did satisfactorily and
was awaiting Sturt on his return.</p>

<p>From Depot Glen Sturt had sent back by Piesse despatches containing
journals and maps--these were sealed and addressed to the Secretary of
State at the Colonial Office.</p>

<p>[10-8] Grey gave instructions (5th November, 1845) that the journals
should be opened and copies made, otherwise they would not know where
Sturt was if he needed relief. The sealed letters were forwarded
unopened.</p>

<p class="ref">[10-8 Archiv. S.A. 170. 25e: A.(1845) 1052&frac12;: A.(1845) 1037,
1041.]</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that in the Archives of Adelaide are two
volumes--one containing the record of the expedition from 10th August,
1844, to 31st March, 1845: this is written by some person other than
Sturt: the other volume dealing with the latter part of the
expedition--from 9th April to 10th November, 1845, is the original
diary written by Sturt himself from day to day.</p>

<p>[10-9] During the long absence of nearly twelve months without any
word from Sturt anxiety as to his fate had been growing: anxiety not
lessened by a story brought to Moorundi in June, 1845, by some natives
that Sturt and his party had all been killed.</p>

<p class="ref">[10-9 Archiv. S.A. 787/1845/123.]</p>

<p>When the rains came in July Sturt, remembering that his expedition
was expressly limited to twelve months, could, and perhaps should, have
returned to Adelaide. He had fulfilled the mission on which he had been
sent by proving that there was no range (although in fact he had lived
for six months in the only range there was), he had found a barren
country, he and the others were suffering from scurvy: he had every
justification for retiring from this forbidding area: but he turned his
back on comfort and safety for another seven months because he had not
reached the centre of the continent and because he had not found that
inland sea which had been a haunting illusion for so long.</p>

<p>An unconquerable soul.</p>

<p><b>C.-NORTHERN JOURNEYS<br>
20th July to 2nd October</b></p>

<p>On 18th July Sturt moved the remainder of the expedition slowly on a
north-west route, and after 61 miles reached their new base at Lake
Pinnaroo on 28th July. This base Sturt first called "The Park" but
later "Fort Grey" after Governor Grey. At the time of the move there
were still 68 sheep left.</p>

<p>Having established this camp Sturt began a series of journeyings,
lasting five months, which provide a story of physical endurance and
courage, without parallel in the whole history of organized
exploration. There were three separate journeys.</p>

<p><i><b>Reconnaissance to the West</b></i></p>

<p>On 30th July, Sturt, Browne and Stuart started off for Lake Torrent.
They reached Lake Blanche about the middle point of its eastern shore,
having crossed Strzelecki Creek about three miles south of Carraweena
homestead. From this point they could see the outlines of the Flinders
Ranges--Mt. Hopeless would be about 32 miles away bearing 210 degrees.
Sturt was then within a short ride of connecting up with Eyre's
northernmost point.</p>

<p>On this journey the surface water upon which they relied was rapidly
drying up, and their safety was delicately balanced. It was on this
journey that Sturt first met with sandhills "like crossing the tops of
houses in some street."</p>

<p>Sturt had established that any movement of his party to the west was
impracticable; also he had proved that there, at least, there was no
inland sea. Some idea of this country is conveyed by Madigan's
description as he saw it, somewhat to the west of Lake Blanche, in
1939.</p>

<p>[10-10] "The Lake Eyre region had cast a queer spell over us. All
who have travelled there have felt this haunting sense of desolation
and death. The song dies on the drover's lips; silence falls on the
exploring party.</p>

<p>"It is like entering a vast tomb; one hesitates to break the
silence. The rivers are dead, the trees are dead, but overshadowing all
in the qualities of death is the very heart of the region, the great
lake itself, a horrible travesty, a vast white prostrate ghost of a
lake. Here time seems to have stood still for ages, and all is dead.
The Dead Heart, the focus of a drainage basin of four hundred and fifty
thousand square miles of country, will never throb again."</p>

<p class="ref">[10-10 Madigan: Crossing the Dead Heart. p.151.]</p>

<p>Before leaving camp on the journey just described Sturt had left
instructions that a "stockyard," in which to herd the cattle at night,
should be made: and he had told Davenport to prepare a garden, planting
it with pumpkins and melons. On his return he found that these things
had been done.</p>

<p><i><b>Journey to the North-West</b></i></p>

<p>Sturt now set about his main push to the north-west in an endeavour
to reach the objective which had always been in his mind--the centre of
the continent: and to decide whether there existed any central range of
mountains connected with the north-east angle of the continent. On 14th
August he started with Browne, Flood, Lewis and Cowley, taking fifteen
weeks' provisions. He took riding horses, two pack horses and a light
cart.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="ill-61"></a><img alt="" src="0700391h-images/sturt-60.jpg"></p>

<p><b>Route North-west to Simpson Desert.</b></p>
</center>

<p>Before leaving he gave instructions to erect a small stockade (in
addition to the stockyard) with close palisades four feet six inches
high, and to have one tent within this stockade in which to deposit all
the arms and ammunition. The final instruction was to prepare and paint
the boat in the event of her being required. There are many proverbs
about the tenacity of hope and the dynamic value of faith--Sturt
embodied them all.</p>

<p>The route of this journey can, for all its difficulties, be briefly
described.</p>

<p>He proceeded on a general course of 25 degrees west of north, but
diverged from this from time to time. His course, however, is known
with reasonable accuracy. He crossed Strzelecki Creek far from any
modern landmarks, crossing, in fact, several subsidiary channels, in
which they dug holes for seepage water in preparation for the return
journey.</p>

<p>Next they came to the multiple channels of Cooper Creek, about
thirty miles south-west of Coongie homestead--in one of the branches
they caught some white fish. Here they saw a white bank of clouds on
the northern horizon: "Could this bank have been over any inland
waters?"</p>

<p>After twenty miles of sandhills they emerged on to a gloomy
stone-clad plain--the Stony Desert--across which they had to travel for
fifty miles: but fortunately they twice found surface water.</p>

<p>At this point he began to cast from him the illusion of seventeen
years:</p>

<p>"Although I had been unable to penetrate to the north-west of Lake
Torrens, still I long kept in view the possibility of its being
connected with some more central body of water. Having gained a
position so much higher to the north I felt doubtful of the immediate
proximity of an inland sea."</p>

<p>The recantation was not quite complete. Having crossed the Stony
Desert they reached the Diamantina basin, crossing the lower section of
Goyder Lagoon, about twenty-five miles south-west of Clifton Hills
homestead. This lagoon was "like the dried-up bed of an enormous muddy
lake." He judged this to be the lowest part of the interior and
momentarily expected to see a mass of water glittering away to the
westward.</p>

<p>Now they began in stern reality to meet the great sand ridges of
this region, and, wearied with trying to cross them, they turned more
northerly along the flats between the ridges. Following this practice,
and finding successive pools of surface water, they came to "Eyre
Creek," which is now called the Mulligan River. This river they first
met about twenty-five miles south of old Annandale homestead after
having passed about ten miles to the west of Alton Downs homestead.</p>

<p>Having followed up the Mulligan to the angle where the river has a
bend to the south-east (the rabbit-proof fence has, at this point a
definite angle changing from a north-west course to a northeast) about
twenty miles north of Annandale.</p>

<p>Sturt then moved on a course of 28 degrees west of north along the
flats between the sandhills to a point, on the edge of the Simpson
Desert, which cannot be fixed accurately; but is, perhaps, between five
and ten miles east of the border between Queensland and the Northern
Territory. Sturt in his Narrative fixes the latitude at 24 degrees 40
minutes S: but in his diary he records it as 24 degrees 50 mins. 23
secs. and on the Arrowsmith map it is given as 24 degrees 30 minutes
S.</p>

<p>The point tentatively fixed from a consideration of all the evidence
now available would be about 24 degrees 41 minutes S: mathematical
accuracy is unimportant, the position now given as the end point of
this journey is approximately correct.</p>

<p>[10-11] There is interesting confirmation in Madigan's account of
this journey in 1939--ninety-four years after Sturt. He emerged from
the Simpson Desert after crossing it from the west at precisely the
place at which Sturt was halted in 1845. He records: "We would reach
the Mulligan next day; we were away next morning...to find the angle in
the rabbit-proof fence." The desert had never been crossed (except for
one crossing at a narrower portion to the south) before Madigan made
the crossing in 1939, and his verdict was that it would have been fatal
for Sturt to have attempted to continue on his course with horses.</p>

<p><b>Sturt's Last Home in Cheltenham.</b></p>
</center>

<p>Convinced of the impossibility of going further than this point,
which he had reached on 8th September, Sturt turned back. He had been
halted:</p>

<p>"In a country such as I firmly believe has no parallel on Earth's
surface.</p>

<p>"I was at that moment scarcely a degree from the Tropic, and within
150 miles of the centre of the continent. If I had gained that spot my
task would have been performed, my most earnest wish would have been
gratified, but for some wise purpose this was denied to me; yet I may
truly say, that I should not thus have abandoned my position, if it had
not been a measure of urgent and imperative necessity."</p>

<p>He was turned back by sand ridges fifty to one hundred feet high,
each running unbroken to the horizon on the north and on the south, in
endless succession to the west. Only one party, well-equipped and with
camels, has ever crossed this region.</p>

<p>Sturt might well have remembered the great rolling waves of the
southern seas, and felt that here, too, Moses with his rod might have
made the sea dry land.</p>

<p>If he had pushed on towards the centre of the continent he would
have had to face the whole breadth--nearly 300 miles--of the Simpson
Desert. He would have reached the Hay River, with an uncertain prospect
of water, after about thirty miles; and thereafter nothing but
sandhills and the certainty of no water.</p>

<p>For these sandhills he had only a light horse-cart already in
serious disrepair.</p>

<p>The task was beyond even his great courage.</p>

<p>His estimate of 150 miles from the centre of the continent was
unduly optimistic. Central Mt. Stuart is more like four hundred miles
distant; but he was within 150 miles of the latitude of the centre of
the continent.</p>

<p>No inland sea, the centre of the continent beyond his reach, he
turned back to the Mulligan River: and, after a short journey to the
north-east during which he may have crossed the eastern branch now
known as Eyre Creek he started on the homeward journey. Their condition
now was bad, their cart was barely holding together, the horses were in
distress, they were down to 5 lbs. of flour and 2 oz. of tea per week,
although they occasionally shot a pigeon or a duck; and all of the
party unwell: Browne's scurvy was becoming serious, and Sturt felt that
he must be taken back to camp before he became like Poole. They made
their way back to Fort Grey, and, apart from the natural and severe
hazards of this region, the return journey was free from incident. Over
the last stage they relied on the wells dug during the outward journey
They had been through one of the most dreary regions in the world: lest
it may be thought that Sturt was easily turned aside from his
objectives, or gave an unduly gloomy description of the country,
another writer, Ratcliffe, described the Cooper Creek region as he saw
it in 1938:</p>

<p>[10-12] "We arrived at the main channel of Cooper's Creek in a weird
three-quarters light, with the western sky shining a luminous green. As
we dropped down from the stony slopes to that flat bed of silt, a chill
fear took hold of me. The dry bed of that dead river, which rose in the
plains of inland Queensland, and vanished in the salt-pans of Lake Eyre
without knowing the sea, was the most eerie and haunted spot I have
ever visited.</p>

<p>"Moreover, it was haunted by no friendly and comprehensible ghosts,
but by the spirits of broken tribes which died misunderstood.</p>

<p>"When we approached the Diamantina, the gibbers completely dominated
the landscape. They grew bigger and bigger, and more densely crowded
together; and when the sandhills deserted us for a while, the world
became little more than a rolling shingly plain, the lumpy red-brown
sterility of which accentuated the empty blueness of the sky.</p>

<p>This was Sturt's Stony Desert, more awe-inspiring and desolate than
any sand-dune desert could be--chiefly, I think, because it presents
its barrenness in such a heavy and unfamiliar form. Sturt referred to
it as 'that iron region.' The term could hardly be bettered. "I can
never think of the Cooper and the Diamantina as mere rivers. They have
spirits of their own, which are not friendly to man."</p>

<p class="ref">[10-12 Ratcliffe: Flying Fox and Drifting Sand. p.270, 277,
291.]</p>

<p>They arrived at Fort Grey on the evening of 2nd October.</p>

<p>What had they accomplished? They had ridden about 900 miles under
the most severe conditions, with limited food and uncertain water, over
country which was extremely depressing and fatiguing, without even a
small hill or large rock to break the monotony. They had proved that
there was no inland sea, no central range in that region, and they had
failed to reach the centre of the continent.</p>

<p>All they had was a sense of achievement, and even that was negative.
But all through this story is that clear impression of courage tempered
with prudence, which met every difficulty and invited no disaster.</p>

<p>It is a very pleasant experience to handle his diary, now in the
Archives at Adelaide, and admire the neatness and faithfulness of his
daily record, kept most scrupulously under extremely adverse conditions
of environment and bodily health.</p>

<p>As two final notes on this particular journey: it is beyond doubt
that the stream now named the Mulligan should, by priority, be called
Eyre Creek, as named by Sturt. And when McDouall Stuart, fifteen years
later, reached what he considered to be the centre of the continent he,
remembering Sturt's unrealized ambition, named the mountain "Mt. Sturt,
after my excellent and esteemed commander of the expedition in 1844 and
1845, Captain Sturt, as a mark of gratitude for the great kindness I
received from him during that journey."</p>

<p>This name was changed by the then Governor of South Australia to
"Central Mount Stuart" after its discoverer--thus sharing with
"Cooper's Creek"* and "Eyre's Creek" the fate of being denied the name
originally given.</p>

<p>(*See p. 140.)</p>

<p><b><i>Journey to Cooper Creek</i><br>
9th October to 17th November</b></p>

<p>Having thus completed long journeys to the west and north-west
Sturt, after his return to Fort Grey, decided to take fresh men and
scout to the north and east. His old dream even then recurred: "Can it
be that there is a large body of water in that quarter?"</p>

<p>He decided that, while he made this dash to the northward, Browne,
with the rest of the party, should start on the long homeward
journey.</p>

<p>Browne, however, refused to go, and after an emotional scene which
is recounted at length in Sturt's Narrative, it was decided that
Browne's decision "never to leave you in this dreadful desert" should
stand, and that Browne should wait at Fort Grey until Sturt's return
from the north. It was, however, arranged that if Browne were forced to
leave he would bury a message in a bottle at the foot of a marked
tree.</p>

<p>There had been no rain at all since that storm in July which had
enabled them to leave the depot at Preservation Creek, so that
prospects of water were uncertain.</p>

<p>Sturt left Fort Grey on 9th October, with Stuart, Morgan, and Mack,
taking ten week's supply of flour and tea.</p>

<p>They followed their old course to Strzelecki Creek, then followed
that creek up to its junction with Cooper Creek. Finding good water
here he intended to go eastward; but a heavy shower of rain tempted him
northward. He crossed Cooper Creek about twenty miles west of
Innamincka almost exactly at the spot known later as Coontie Hill,
travelled due north to Lake Lipson, passing about ten miles to the east
of Coongie homestead: then in a general north-westerly direction thirty
miles to the east of Clifton Hills homestead to a point almost on the
Queensland border about fifteen miles south-east of Birdsville.</p>

<p>On this outward journey they dug wells to collect surface water.
Having found nothing but sandhills and gibber plains, and the water
situation becoming very precarious, they returned to Cooper Creek. This
return journey was bad--one of the horses died, and they had to travel
all of one night following their old tracks by lamplight.</p>

<p>Here anxiety began to press on Sturt:</p>

<p>"I had still the mountain range to the north-east to examine, and I
knew no time was to be lost. Indeed, I doubted if my return to the
depot was not already shut out by the drying up of the water in
Strzelecki creek. I would gladly have rested for a few days, for I was
beginning to feel weak. My food had been insufficient to support me,
and I had a malady hanging upon me that was slowly doing its work."</p>

<p>For six days they followed up the course of Cooper Creek, seeing
myriads of the white fish they had noticed in the lower reaches of the
creek, noting the large rocks in the stream eighteen miles east of
Nappa Merri, until having reached the point where Cooper Creek divides
into many channels, and learning from the natives that there was no
water farther east, they turned back. Examining all evidence it seems
probable that Sturt's farthest east point, according to the evidence of
the Counsel tracing and the Arrowsmith map, was on the Wilson River
between 20 and 30 miles above its junction with the main channel of
Cooper Creek.</p>

<p>If this is correct, he was then about forty miles from the end point
of his journey the previous February: and it is an interesting
speculation that by going back over his old route to Fort Grey he would
have saved a great distance. They returned downstream to their starting
point, and here Sturt named the stream "Cooper's Creek."</p>

<p>"I would gladly have laid this creek down as a river, but as it had
no current I did not feel justified in so doing: there can be no doubt
but that it would support a number of cattle upon its banks, but its
agricultural capabilities appear to me to be doubtful."</p>

<p>While on Cooper Creek it was necessary to turn one of the horses
loose, it could go no farther: it was seen on these plains still alive
sixteen years later. From Strzelecki Creek to the depot they had a very
bad journey. The heat was intense, they could find no water, and their
food was nearly exhausted.</p>

<p>It was here they had to stop for one day because of the fierce hot
wind: it was on this day that the mercury rose so high that it burst
the thermometer. On the last stage of this journey another of the
horses died.</p>

<p>They arrived at Fort Grey on 13th November, rode slowly up to the
stockade, and found it deserted.</p>

<p>This was the end of their explorings: nothing was left but the
journey home.</p>

<p>On this journey they had still found no central range and no inland
sea, but they had found in Cooper Creek a water supply that was to be a
notable feature in the development of that part of the continent.</p>

<p>Concerning the name of this creek, there later occurred some
confusion, which, in fact, still persists. Mitchell discovered the
upper reaches of this river and named it the Victoria River. Later
Kennedy added the native name Barcoo, and still later Gregory had been
on this river. The authorities in Sydney and London on the incorrect
assumption that Mitchell had been the first on this river (they adopted
his date as 14th September, 1845) gave his name priority, and accepted
the name Victoria River.[10-13] Parker and Somerville, in 1943, pointed
out the error, as Mitchell was not on this river until 1846, a year
later than Sturt. On the Arrowsmith map the lower reaches where Sturt
visited are named "Cooper Creek," Mitchell's section is named "R.
Victoria (Barcoo)." On the Counsel tracing, however, Sturt's section
was originally labelled Cooper's Creek, but the "Cooper's" has been
erased and it' is now "The Barcoo Creek," the Mitchell section by
contrast is labelled "R. Victoria (Barcoo)" but with a later printing
"River Cooper." Even on the International Map issued by the
Commonwealth the name "Barcoo or Cooper's Creek" appears.</p>

<p class="ref">[10-13 Parker and Somerville. Historical Studies. Vol. II, No. 8,
Nov., 1943.]</p>

<p>It is the story of the "Murray or Hume" over again. These matters
should be officially settled, and in justice to Sturt the names given
by him should stand.</p>

<p>As has already been stated, a tree had been marked before Sturt's
departure. At the south-eastern corner of Lake Pinnaroo there is a tree
carrying, near ground level, an old blaze mark; and above it, on the
same tree, is a later blaze mark into which has been cut "Sturt 1845"
above which is a broad arrow.* This was not cut by Sturt. The
suggestion that this is the tree marked by Sturt is a reasonable
speculation, but that is all that can be said.</p>

<p>(* See Appendix D, Note 9.)</p>

<p>Seeking in the place arranged, Sturt found a message from Browne
that, as the sole remaining water had become putrid and disagreed with
the men to a serious extent, he had been obliged to retire to
Preservation Creek. Sturt was, naturally, desperately disappointed, but
he understood Browne's problem: there was nothing for Sturt to do but
follow, which he did, reaching their old depot on 17th November.</p>

<p>At Fort Grey he had had a violent attack of muscular pain, which he
attributed to having eaten a small piece of bacon: it was, however,
more probably a manifestation of the scurvy which was still undermining
his health.</p>

<p>On dismounting at the Depot at Preservation Creek he had another
severe attack of muscular cramp. Browne and the other men had all
recovered and all was well at the base.</p>

<p><b>D.--THE JOURNEY HOME</b></p>

<p>They were now faced with a critical retreat of about 250 miles: the
natives warned Sturt that what water there was was rapidly
disappearing: the heat was greater than that of the previous summer,
the thermometer ranging between 110 degrees and 123 degrees every day:
the wind blowing heavily from the north-east filled with impalpable red
dust, the ground so hot that matches falling on it were ignited. All
the grass had gone from near the camp, many trees had been cut down:
and there had been no rain since that heavy downpour which had released
them the previous July. Sturt recorded his curiosity as to how
Leichhardt was faring. Actually, at this very time, that explorer was
having great trouble about food. Browne and Flood scouted to the south,
returning with the information that there was no water anywhere.</p>

<p>Browne and Flood then made a rather desperate dash to Flood Creek,
returning after eight days with the report that there was still water
in the creek, black as ink, and it would have all gone in a week.</p>

<p>Sturt was now seriously ill with scurvy, unable to move because of
muscular rigidity: he was a complete invalid and had to rely on
Browne.</p>

<p>He arranged to have four bullocks killed and skinned--each skin,
being used as water cask, held 150 gallons. Then, getting the drays
ready, and abandoning all heavier stores, they began their retreat.</p>

<p>At this point occurs in the Narrative the most dramatic single
sentence in the whole of Sturt's own story of his various expeditions:
"The boat was launched upon the creek, which I vainly hoped would have
ploughed the waters of a central sea."</p>

<p>[10-14] The last of the three boats in eighteen years, only one of
which had been used. The fate of this boat is of some interest.
Tietkens found some of the fragments in the driftwood near the creek.
It was clinker built and made of cedar or some such wood. Specimens
were sent to the Melbourne Museum, but these have been lost.</p>

<p class="ref">[10-14 R.A.H.S. XIV. 219.]</p>

<p>[10-15] Woore, in 1863, found one side of the boat some twenty feet
from the ground in a large gum tree in Evelyn Creek. He sent a small
piece to Sturt's brother. This piece was sent by the Sturt family to
the Adelaide Art Gallery, where it now is. It carries an inscription
which states wrongly that it was found in a tree forty feet from the
ground. There is a piece in the Broken Hill Museum said to be from this
boat. No other relic is known.</p>

<p class="ref">[10-15 R.A.H.S. XIV. 223.]</p>

<p>To appreciate Depot Glen and its surroundings it is advisable to
approach it from the northern side. From the main road southwards from
Tibooburra a branch track leads off south-westerly to Mt. Poole
Station.</p>

<p>This road rises to an almost imperceptible divide, from the crest of
which the first view is obtained. To the north-west is Mt. Poole, to
the south-west Mt. Browne, and straight ahead lies the Mt. Poole
homestead.</p>

<p>In the near foreground Evelyn Creek is plainly seen winding down
from the north, and in the distance Preservation Creek comes from the
west to join Evelyn Creek on the observer's left. Gazing over this
scene it is realized that the locality is just as Sturt saw it: the
observer can say, looking towards Mt. Poole:</p>

<p>"Between us and it there were undulating plains, covered with stones
or salsolaceous herbage, excepting in the hollows, wherein there was a
little grass."</p>

<p>At the site of the depot no trace, except Poole's tree, remains to
mark their stay: the water-hole on which they depended for water has
become badly silted. The gorge, quarter of a mile up the creek, has a
cliff face similar to the drawing made by Sturt, although it is hardly
so majestic as shown there (Narr. Cent. 1.266). Many more trees are
present now than are shown in that picture, there is not any cliff face
on the left, and the sand banks shown in the foreground have become
larger.</p>

<p>James Poole lies, as he has lain for a hundred years, in the
undisturbed peace of the great plains and the shelter of the nearby
trees: the morning sun lights up his guardian tree, but, as the sun
moves on, the shadows form over his grave, and each day closes again to
him that north-west he was never to reach.</p>

<p>It is to Mt. Poole that one must go to capture the spirit of Sturt.
These great plains, with their whispering winds, seem to suggest that
great spirit still restlessly unsatisfied, seeking--not any more an
inland sea--but the answer to the challenge of that silent, hostile
land.</p>

<p>From the time of leaving the depot at Preservation Creek, Sturt,
having lost the use of his limbs, had to be carried in one of the
drays, greatly distressed by the constant jolting. They followed their
old tracks back to Morphett Creek, except for a detour to avoid the
pine forest and the sandhills.</p>

<p>Near Morphett Creek Browne had noticed the natives eating a small
acid berry and had gathered a quantity of these for Sturt, who at once
began to improve: he attributed his recovery to these berries, which
are presumed to have been the Berry saltbush (Enchylaena tomentosa), or
Leptomeria aphylla.</p>

<p>From this point to Menindie, where Piesse was waiting for them,
their journey was slow but safe, and Sturt now began to feel the
benefit of the change of diet, and doubtless, though he does not
mention it, the relaxation of mental strain and anxiety.</p>

<p>[10-16] During the long journey from the depot on Preservation Creek
they had travelled all night, six nights out of twelve.</p>

<p class="ref">[10-16 Archiv. S.A. A.(1845) 38.]</p>

<p>Before leaving Menindie, Sturt had cut into a tree a quarter of a
mile below the junction of the Williorara with the Darling, the letters
"G.A.E.Dec.24.1843." There would appear to be two misprints in this
inscription as recorded in the Narrative: 1843 should be 1845, and
G.A.E. should be C.A.E. for "Central Australian Expedition." This tree
has disappeared. They reached Moorundi on 15th January, but while
warmly welcomed by the natives, they learned that Eyre had left. He had
written to Gipps (7th November, 1844) giving up hope of being placed in
command of any expedition, and adding:</p>

<p>[10-17] "I have no scope for exertion where I am now, and have done
all the good I can do towards establishing a friendly intercourse with
the aborigines up the Murray to the Darling."</p>

<p class="ref">[10-17 R.G.S.S.A. IV. 129.]</p>

<p>At Moorundi Sturt was again able to ride, and began his journey to
Adelaide. He was met by Mr. C. Campbell and Mr. A. Hardy with a
carriage to convey him to Adelaide.</p>

<p>"I reached my home at midnight on the 19th January, and, on crossing
its threshold, raised my wife from the floor on which she had fallen,
and heard my considerate friends roll rapidly away."</p>

<p>The rest of the party reached Adelaide a few days later: they are
described in a contemporary account as gaunt, their faces hidden in
unkempt hair, their skin burnt almost to the colour of the aborigines.
The horses were living skeletons, but the remainder of the sheep
followed the drays as quietly and regularly as a rearguard of
infantry.</p>

<p>[10-18] Sturt brought back 7 horses, the greater number of the
bullocks, and some of the sheep. These were sold at auction, with the
remainder of the equipment, and the total sum realized was &pound;349:
the net cost of the expedition, after this sale, was &pound;3,309.</p>

<p class="ref">[10-18 Archiv. S.A. 700, 17Z.: 558, 25f.]</p>

<p><b>E.--EXPERIENCES WITH ABORIGINES</b></p>

<p>When Sturt reached the Murray at Moorundi fourteen years had passed
since, on his boat journey, he had made his first contact with the
natives. During that interval there had been many clashes between
natives and overlanding parties, sometimes attended with considerable
slaughter of the natives.</p>

<p>But Eyre had been stationed there, had travelled considerably
amongst and greatly influenced the natives in the Murray-Darling
region. Sturt, therefore, had no trouble right up to Menindie--at that
point, however, memories of the trouble with Mitchell's party nine
years before remained, but, after initial suspicion, relations became
very friendly.</p>

<p>Once the party had left the river they met very few natives, thinly
scattered over the interior: in fact, between the Darling and Cooper
Creek Sturt estimated they did not meet more than one hundred natives.
He described them as a feeble and diminutive race when compared with
the river tribes.</p>

<p>At Cooper Creek the natives were numerous, numbering some hundreds.
They were extremely friendly, helping with the horses, and treated
Sturt and his companions with genuine hospitality. These natives Sturt
described as the finest he had seen in Australia, all tall and
physically perfect. The women, however, were half-starved, unhappy
looking creatures. This was the last of Sturt's contacts with primitive
aborigines, and it was the occasion for certain reflections. He felt
that he could honestly say that, while he had often been in situations
of danger when he might have been justified in violent action, his path
amongst the natives had been bloodless.</p>

<p>He had always made allowance for the timidity of the natives in the
new experience of meeting white men and strange animals; and had
respected native customs and prejudices.</p>

<p>He knew that no European who followed his tracks would suffer
because of anything he had done.</p>

<p>But he did regret that the progress of civilized man into an
uncivilized region was almost invariably attended with misfortune to
the original inhabitants.</p>

<p><b>F.--RESULTS OF THE EXPEDITION</b></p>

<p>In his official report to the Colonial Office, in a statement
published in the South Australian Gazette (13th February, 1847), and in
his published Narrative, Sturt reviews the results of this expedition.
He stated that he had completely carried out his instructions and had
proved that no range of mountains running from south-west to north-east
existed. On the other hand he had been disappointed in that he had not
found any good country, had not found an inland sea, and had not
reached the centre of the continent, although he was within 150 miles
of it; after pointing out the forbidding nature of the country, he
emphasized that the development of the interior depended entirely on
that spirit of enterprise which has always moved man in the overcoming
of difficulties.</p>

<p>Referring to the fact that he was never likely to go again into the
field as an explorer, he expressed his keen regret that he should have
achieved so little, and made no discovery of any practical
importance.</p>

<p>He spoke in terms of the highest praise of the conduct and fidelity
of all those who had been with him: and his published Narrative
concluded:</p>

<p>"I have recorded instances enough of the watchful superintendence of
that Providence over me and my party without whose guidance we should
have perished, nor can I more appropriately close these humble sheets,
than by such an acknowledgment, and expressing my fervent thanks to
Almighty God for the mercies vouchsafed to me during the trying and
doubtful service on which I was employed.</p>

<p>"Not to myself do I accord any credit that I returned from my
wanderings to my home. Assuredly, if it had not been for other guidance
than the exercise of my own prudence I should have perished.</p>

<p>"If, amidst difficulties and disappointments of no common
description, I was led to doubt the wisdom of Providence, I was
wrong."</p>

<p>And, one passage deserves to be quoted separately; remembering that
it was written in 1848: "I am still of the opinion that there is more
than one sea in the interior of the Australian continent: but such may
not be the case."</p>

<p>In stating that he had proved there was no central watershed running
from south-west to north-east, he was literally wrong.</p>

<p>Actually such a range did exist--he had been travelling along it and
living on it for months from the Barrier Range to the Grey Range, and
its outliers McDonald's Peak and Stokes Range. It is true that it is a
debased range and a worn watershed, but it is a true "divide" and was
the one he was seeking. He received warm appreciation of the magnitude
of his discoveries and of his skill as leader.</p>

<p>[10-19] Grey had left Adelaide, and Robe was now Governor. In
acknowledging Sturt's official report, and referring to the statement
that there had been no discovery of practical value, Robe commented
that Sturt had undervalued his own work. The Secretary of State for the
Colonies expressed his high sense of the courage and perseverance
displayed by Sturt and his companions, and his warm approbation of the
humane conduct towards the aborigines. And he thanked Sturt for his
offer to take command of another expedition: but that, for "various
reasons it had better be deferred for the present."</p>

<p class="ref">[10-19 Archiv. S.A. L.(1846) 153.]</p>

<p>This indomitable man, his body still soft from scurvy, had offered
to lead another expedition. But his physical wanderings were over, even
though, in fancy, he was often back in the desert scanning the horizon
for his inland sea.</p>

<p>[10-20] The request he had lodged, before departure, to be
considered for the position of Colonial Treasurer had not been
forgotten, for, on 17th February, 1846, he was appointed to that office
as "a permanent arrangement," and commenced duty on 1st March. For this
appointment he received an additional &pound;100 per annum, making,
with his &pound;400 salary as Registrar-General, a total of &pound;500
per annum--not very much for a man of fifty years of age who had done
so much, at such great sacrifice to his own interests.</p>

<p class="ref">[10-20 Archiv. S.A. A.(1846) 187: L.(1846) 150, 151.]</p>

<p>On 24th May he was honoured by the award of the gold medal of the
Royal Geographical Society. The President of that Society, in declaring
the award, spoke of his energy and courage, his prudence in halting
when further advance would have risked lives for which he was
responsible, and of his conciliatory conduct towards the natives. Sturt
was, unfortunately, not in England, so that he was not able,
personally, to receive the medal. Mr. John Morphett was entrusted with
the pleasant task of delivering it to him.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI - End of Life in South Australia</h2>

<p>After he had returned to Adelaide and been appointed Colonial
Treasurer, he began a period of happier life. Grey had gone, and Robe,
a strong character, universally respected, treated Sturt with
consideration: the two became firm friends.</p>

<p>On 20th February, 1846, soon after his return, Sturt was welcomed at
a public dinner: in his speech there he told them of the barren
country, his constant anxiety, and his disappointment in failing to
reach the centre of the continent. "I was within eight or ten days'
ride of that point to reach which I would almost have given my
life."</p>

<p>The Colony had now overcome its initial difficulties.</p>

<p>Grey's firm administration had produced order in official matters,
agriculture had succeeded, and the development of copper mines had
brought prosperity.</p>

<p>Sturt, however, felt that he might reasonably look to the Colonial
office for some greater recognition of his efforts than the position he
held in Adelaide. He decided to visit England and present his claims
personally, seeking Darling's help in these efforts. "If I fail I can
only fall back on the office I hold and return to a country to which I
am sincerely and strongly attached." He also thought it was due to his
wife to give her an opportunity of seeing her mother again.</p>

<p>[11-1] Accordingly, early in 1847, he applied for leave of absence
for eighteen months. This being granted, the whole family left on the
brig "Appleton" on 8th May.</p>

<p class="ref">[11-1 Archiv. S.A. A.(1847) 469: N.(1847) 207.]</p>

<p>Before his departure a public "breakfast" was given in his honour
(30th April): a notice appearing in the daily press that, on this
occasion, the public offices would be closed. The daily newspaper
stated that one of the most decided proofs of the deep respect in which
the community held Sturt was the fact that the principal shops also
closed for the time of the breakfast. A testimonial in the form of a
cash public subscription was presented to Sturt at this breakfast.
Sturt, in acknowledging this, said that he wished it to be invested in
land adjoining his property at the Reed Beds.</p>

<p>"I do not intend to sell my landed property, but wish it to remain
in my family: and the part presented to me by the colonists will be a
most honourable heir-loom for my descendants."</p>

<p>With this money Section 1006 containing 182 acres was bought by
Sturt on 10th July, 1847.</p>

<p>There is here something a little puzzling. On 27th April, three days
before this breakfast, Sturt's "furniture, books, carriage, horses and
cattle" had been sold by auction: and, while he was in England, the
Southern Australian of 24th October, 1848, advertised the sale, on 28th
October, of The Grange, situated on the Reed Beds, "formerly the
residence of Captain Sturt, and now that of R. F. Newland." A later
issue stated that it had been purchased by Mr. A. Baker for &pound;825.
Whether this purchase was not completed, or just what is the
explanation, is not known, but Sturt on his return to Adelaide in 1849
lived at Grange until he [11-2] finally left the Colony: and, so late
as 9th September, 1869, Lady Sturt wrote to Wright Brothers in Adelaide
enquiring about the payment of rent by Baker.* (* See Life, p.
351.)</p>

<p class="ref">[11-2 Archiv. S.A. (95, 25f).]</p>

<p>[11-3] To complete the story of this property for present purposes,
Sturt bought an additional 40 acres in 1850 for &pound;100.</p>

<p class="ref">[11-3 Information supplied by Surveyor-General, S.A.]</p>

<p>In October the family landed in England, taking lodgings in Keppel
Street, London, quite near to the Gawlers. Sturt had a course of
treatment for his eyes, and obtained considerable relief, although
there was permanent injury.</p>

<p>During this stay in England, Sturt completed his <i>Narrative of an
Exploration into Central Australia</i>, which was published by Boone in
1849. This volume was dedicated to Earl Grey, who had succeeded Stanley
as Secretary of State for the Colonies. The first of the two volumes of
this work contains a publisher's note that Mr. Arrow-smith had prepared
a large map of Captain Sturt's route from the original protractions and
other official documents. This is the "Arrowsmith Map" referred to in
the present volume.</p>

<p>After the publication of his book, Sturt, with the family, left
England for Adelaide, arriving there in August, 1849.</p>

<p>Evidently his representations to the Colonial Office had not been
successful, although by direction of the Colonial Office he was, on his
return, appointed to the post of Colonial Secretary.</p>

<p>In Mrs. Sturt's <i>Life</i> are interesting details of incidents on
both homeward and outward voyages, in which Sturt showed that tact and
strength of character which he always showed when the need arose.</p>

<p>They found South Australia still more prosperous, with a healthy
growth of population and industry.</p>

<p>Governor Robe had left (2nd August, 1848) and had been succeeded by
Fox Young, whose term ended on 20th October, 1854.</p>

<p>On his return to Adelaide about August, 1849 (his eighteen months'
leave had become two years and three months) Sturt was appointed
Colonial Secretary (24th August, 1849) and continued in that position
till his retirement in 1851. He was throughout this period in happy
official relationships on every side.</p>

<p>As Colonial Secretary he was a member of the Legislative Council. By
law which became effective in January, 1851, a new council was formed,
sixteen elected members being added to the original eight nominated by
the Crown. As Colonial Secretary, Sturt supervised the introduction of
an electoral system in South Australia.</p>

<p>During this period he took an active part, with Governor Young, in
initiating river traffic on the Murray, and had the satisfaction of
seeing the fulfilment of his prophecies of thirteen years before, that
navigation was possible as far as, but not through, the Murray
mouth.</p>

<p>Sturt's life during this period was busy, but happy; he had all
those responsibilities which were the lot of the Colonial Secretary in
those times, and his home life was happy, although his salary was never
more than &pound;700 per annum.</p>

<p>He was back at Grange, but two events soon changed their happy
life--his sight began to fail, and a small addition to their income by
the death of Mrs. Sturt's mother enabled him to send his eldest son to
Rugby.</p>

<p>He then decided to retire.</p>

<p>On 5th December, 1851, the Legislative Council presented an address
to the Governor requesting His Excellency to introduce a Bill for the
purpose of granting an annuity for life to the Honourable Captain
Sturt.</p>

<p>[11-4] Mr. G. F. Angas, while commending the purpose of the Bill,
moved an amendment to have a clause inserted declaring that it is not
to be considered as a precedent for retiring pensions to official
persons in South Australia--"a system," said Mr. Angas, "servile in
itself and calculated to induce improvidence." The amendment was
carried by a majority of ten to six. The Bill otherwise was passed and
became law on 18th December, 1851 (Act. No. 12 of 1851): it included
the following preamble:</p>

<p class="ref">[11-4 Hodder: History of South Australia. 1.254.]</p>

<p>"Whereas the discovery and exploration of the River Murray by the
Honourable Charles Sturt have greatly tended to facilitate the
establishment and prosperity of the Province of South Australia: and,
in the prosecution of such discovery and exploration, and in other
public services of similar character, the said Honourable Charles Sturt
hath sustained great toils and privations to the permanent weakening of
his health, and hath thereby become less capable of the performance of
public duties: And whereas it is expedient by way of reward of such
discovery, and of compensation for such toils and privations and loss
of health, to provide for the honourable retirement from the Public
Service of the said Honourable Charles Sturt by conferring upon him an
annuity for the term of his natural life..."</p>

<p>[11-5] Sturt, having been advised by the Governor of this Act,
submitted his formal resignation as Colonial Secretary to take effect
from 31st December. The Governor replied that under circumstances alike
honourable to Sturt himself and to the Colony, he accepted the
resignation.</p>

<p class="ref">[11-5 Archiv. S.A. A.(1851) 3918: S.(1851) 814, 818.]</p>

<p>[11-6] To the Speaker of the Legislative Council Sturt addressed
(24th December, 1851) a feeling letter of thanks.</p>

<p class="ref">[11-6 Archiv. S.A. A.(1851) 3940.]</p>

<p>[11-7] He had been a member of "the Council" from his first
appointment in 1839 till its final meeting on 18th February, 1843:
evidently Grey did not accept his offered resignation (see Ch. 9:
'...leaving Sturt only the position of Registrar-General...'). After
this Council was dissolved, it was replaced by two bodies: the
Legislative Council (composed of certain Government officials and
nominees) and the Executive Council (composed of certain Government
officials only). Sturt was a member of the former body from its
creation in June, 1843, till his resignation on 31st December,
1851.</p>

<p class="ref">[11-7 Information supplied by the Archivist, S.A.]</p>

<p>And so concluded Sturt's period in the civil service of Australia.
As a good public; servant he continued his routine duties to the end,
for, on 30th December, 1851, he advised the Commissioner of Police that
the unexpended balance of &pound;162 for fencing police paddocks would
be carried forward for the service of the year 1852.</p>

<p>In 1851 the discovery of gold in Victoria had profoundly affected
South Australia. Industry and finance became disorganised, and through
1852 and 1853, Sturt's last years in South Australia, considerable
difficulties resulted.</p>

<p>The year 1852 was spent quietly at his home, Grange. From here,
writing to his old friend, George Macleay (19th May, 1852), he explains
that he felt he could not refuse the offer of a pension, as he laboured
under unusual difficulties: his sight had become very feeble: he
said:</p>

<p>"I am under no restraint and might go home to-morrow if I pleased.
But England would not agree with me, and I am strongly attached to the
spot on which I am established."</p>

<p>But, as the year went on, the economic dislocation brought
increasing difficulties. He wrote to his son, Napier, at Rugby (7th
December, 1852) that, as there were no servants, consideration for Mrs.
Sturt would drive them away from South Australia. Rising prices greatly
reduced the value of Sturt's pension and he felt, if he were to educate
the other two boys properly, he would have to go to England.</p>

<p>On 19th March, 1853, Sturt, with his family, embarked on the ship
"Henry Tanner." The Register newspaper noted his departure with the
comment that he would carry with him "during his temporary absence,"
the affectionate regards and best wishes of every colonist in South
Australia. But he did not return to Australia.</p>

<p>[11-8] There is still to be seen a friendly letter written from St.
Helena by Sturt to the faithful friend Davenport, in which he speaks of
having had trouble with the sailors.</p>

<p class="ref">[11-8 Letters in Archives, S.A.]</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII - Last Years in England</h2>

<h4>1853 TO 1869</h4>

<p>The remainder of Sturt's life was spent in England devoted to the
care of his family. All three sons went into the Army--leaving him, by
1858, with only the daughter, Charlotte, at home. He lived at 19
Clarence Square, Cheltenham. In 1854 he was very busy in connection
with Gregory's expedition. It was probably in connection with this that
Mrs. Sturt wrote to Davenport (16th March, 1854) that there had been
some talk of Sturt's going as leader of another expedition, but that
he, very wisely, was not thinking of it. He was then in his sixtieth
year.</p>

<p>In the possession of the Royal Geographical Society in London is a
letter from Sturt, dated 12th February, 1854, in which he states his
views as to the routes that might be followed. It is interesting to
note the persistence of his ideas:</p>

<p>"The question naturally arises--where or to what point do these
waters flow? Do they accumulate and form an inland sea separated from
the ocean by the Great Australian wall, or do they follow the principle
of all internal waters of the continent, and, spreading over still
greater areas, are lost by the joint effects of evaporation and
absorption? This is the greatest remaining geographical problem of the
day."</p>

<p>Two interesting letters from Gregory are still preserved. Gregory
wrote to his brother (5th June, 1855):</p>

<p>[12-1] "Captain Sturt has sent out about 50 pages of theory about
the Central Desert as a groundwork for instructions for the guidance of
the expedition: but I told the Governor that I considered that the
object of the expedition was to gather materials for forming theory
upon and not to substantiate theory already formed."</p>

<p class="ref">[12-1 Mit. Lib. MSS. Letter. A.g.34.]</p>

<p>[12-2] And, one month later (13th July, 1855), writing to Sturt
himself, he said:</p>

<p class="ref">[12-2 Sturt papers.]</p>

<p>"In details of the arrangements I have been entirely dependent on
the little experience obtained in Western Australia, as Sir Thomas
Mitchell, who is the only person now in Sydney who could have afforded
me any practical assistance or advice on these points, and from whose
experience I had hoped to profit, has refused in a most discourteous
manner to afford me any information."</p>

<p>Mitchell was himself again.</p>

<p>Anticipating a little in the sequence of years, it can be recorded
that, in 1858, he offered to the Colonial Office his comments on the
results of Gregory's expedition. The direction of the expedition in
England had first been entrusted to the Royal Geographical Society, but
had, later, been taken over by the Colonial Office, which requested
Sturt to superintend in England the direction and preparation of the
expedition.</p>

<p>It was in pursuit of this responsibility that he prepared the
memorandum of fifty pages to which Gregory refers in the letter quoted
above.</p>

<p>[12-3] Now, after the expedition, Sturt reviewed the results. He
pointed out that Gregory had experienced the same desert-like
conditions 1,000 miles to the west as he had experienced at Simpson
Desert--from this he deduced, wrongly, that the Central Desert occupied
continuously the whole centre of the Continent. He discussed at great
length the formation of the sandhills, and the still unknown fate of
the inland waters: but for the first time he made no direct reference
to an inland sea, speaking only of "some remote basin to the
westward."</p>

<p class="ref">[12-3 Public Records Office, London, 855, Australia.]</p>

<p>He made the novel suggestion that there should be a convict
settlement at Victoria River, N.T., for convicted persons from British
possessions in Asia.</p>

<p>While the remainder of Sturt's interesting commentary was published
as a Parliamentary paper in England, this suggestion of a convict
establishment was, by order of the Colonial Secretary, omitted, and has
only now come to light.</p>

<p>It does not appear that, after 1858, Sturt had much direct
association with exploration projects.</p>

<p>In 1855, on the death of Hotham, Governor of Victoria, Sturt applied
to the Colonial Office for the post, but received a not very courteous
reply (21st April, 1856) to the effect that, while the value of his
past services was recognized, the writer did "not feel justified in
holding out any expectation" that he would be appointed.</p>

<p>The year 1859 seemed to hold out some prospect that he might be
appointed as the first Governor of Queensland. Letters written to Mr.
Hector in Adelaide in April, 1859, indicate, indeed, that he had the
refusal of the position. Letters written at this time and now in the
Archives at Adelaide suggest that he feared that, if he took this
position, the South Australian Government would stop his pension.</p>

<p>Evidently there was some probability of the appointment, for both
the <i>Empire</i> (30th May, 1859) in Sydney, and the <i>South
Australian Register</i> (6th June) announced the appointment. In the
<i>Empire</i>, however, the authenticity of the news was
questioned.</p>

<p>[12-4] It is certain that, on 27th May, 1858. Sturt had addressed to
the Secretary of State a formal application for appointment to this
post, setting out his experience and qualifications. His original
application carries an office notation dated 6th June stating that his
"application will not fail to be duly considered by Lord Stanley"--then
follow notations by various other officers about Sturt's experience in
South Australia--but while this was going on, Stanley himself cut the
discussion short with this minute:</p>

<p class="ref">[12-4 Public Records Office, London, 5158, New South Wales]</p>

<p>"Captain Sturt has applied for the new Government of Moreton Bay,
whenever that is created. I doubt whether this request can be complied
with, for Sir Wm. Denison had a complete list of officeholders
ready--all of them gentlemen actually on the spot--but I wish to leave
on record my hope that something may be done for Captain Sturt.</p>

<p>"His enterprise and adventure--his services in the cause of
Australian discovery, and his general abilities, as they appeared to
me, indicate him as one who may be useful for colonial service.</p>

<p>"I write on public grounds only, never having seen Capt. Sturt until
a few days ago." (31st May.)</p>

<p>What happened between that time (May, 1858) and the confident
expectations of 1859 is not known. A memorial in the shape of a
petition from a number of residents of Moreton Bay, praying for Sturt's
appointment as Governor, was sent to the Colonial Office in 1859. By
this time Bulwer Lytton was Secretary of State.</p>

<p>But, whatever happened, Sturt was not appointed: and Stanley's
minute, as quoted above, is the epitaph on his life in the service of
his country: he served greatly, he deserved well, he was not
rewarded.</p>

<p>In 1859 came the first signs of failing health: he wrote to Hector,
in Adelaide, that he was suffering from rheumatism and could not
stir.</p>

<p>In 1860, four private citizens paid a practical tribute to Sturt.
Mr. E. B. Scott, in a letter to Sturt (20th October, 1860) advised him
that four of them, Messrs. Fletcher, Parry, Crosier and himself, had,
at the first sale of Crown lands at Wentworth, purchased two allotments
in Sturt's name, and he could collect the title deeds at the Lands
Office in Sydney.</p>

<p>From 1860 onwards, he was then sixty-five years old, was a period of
diminishing activity.</p>

<p>To this period belongs the expedition to Central and Northern
Australia of his old companion, McDouall Stuart, which has already been
noted. Through Stuart, his faithful friend, did Sturt, vicariously
reach that centre of the continent which "for some wise purpose was
denied to me." In the summer of 1862-63 he suffered a prolonged illness
from which he recovered. Letters from his friends came regularly.
Harris Browne wrote telling him, among other things, that Howitt had
caught the roan horse they had turned loose on Cooper Creek sixteen
years before. In 1864 he lost his son Evelyn, who died in India from
cholera: this was the one great sorrow that clouded his last years.</p>

<p>In 1866 he wrote to his old friend, Sir Charles Cooper, that his
sight was much worse, and he was unable to read his own writing.</p>

<p>In March, 1869, he attended a dinner of the Colonial Society, where
it was announced that the Government intended to extend to the colonies
the order of St. Michael and St. George. As to subsequent events there
is a conflict of testimony.</p>

<p>Sturt wrote to Cooper (5th April, 1869), that he had been urged to
send in his claims, and although reluctant, allowed himself to be
talked over. He wrote to Robe, who took the letter to Grey: the two
then jointly addressed a letter to the Secretary of State. Sturt then
wrote to thank Grey, and, in reply, received a curious letter, in which
occurs the following passage:</p>

<p>"When first told of your wanting this new order I was averse to your
getting it, and still am so...The highest class of the order is held by
men of no service or repute, and will add nothing to your dignity or
reputation.</p>

<p>"I thought you greater as an overlooked man, tranquil and patient
under neglect, and calmly satisfied that his services, sufferings and
success in arduous undertakings would be fully recognized by a grateful
posterity, than I shall think of you as a member of an order unknown in
England, and in that order inferior in rank to men to whom in services
and claims you are incomparably superior."</p>

<p>The letter which Sturt wrote in reply to this is not quoted here; it
contains no evidence of resentment, but conveys warm thanks to Grey for
his co-operation with Robe:</p>

<p>"I do not know how I can sufficiently thank you for your kind and
most ready co-operation with Robe on my behalf."</p>

<p>[12-5] It has been said of Grey that he never learned to suffer his
equals gladly.</p>

<p class="ref">[12-5 Hall: Australia and England. p.55.]</p>

<p>An interesting sequel to all this was Grey's speech in Adelaide
twenty-two years later.</p>

<p>[12-6] As Sir George Grey, K.C.B., he revisited Adelaide in 1891 and
at a public dinner gave his version of the knighthood story: it was
substantially the same as that given, above, except that he took to
himself the leading role and full credit for having initiated the whole
matter, approaching Robe and Young, and making a joint approach to the
Colonial Office.</p>

<p class="ref">[12-6 Adelaide Observer, 18th April, 1891.]</p>

<p>Where there is any credit to be gained, memories are often
unreliable, and perhaps Grey had forgotten that it was Robe who had
approached him; and perhaps he did not wish to remember the letter he
had written to Sturt.</p>

<p>The request was granted, and the matter so, far advanced that Sturt
had the knowledge that he was to receive the K.C.M.G.; but, on the
afternoon of 16th June, 1869, Charles Sturt, without a title, sitting
in a chair alone, with no warning, and without pain, passed from this
life.</p>

<p>Although Sturt never received his title, the Queen graciously gave
permission for Mrs. Sturt to use the title of Lady Sturt.</p>

<p>The eldest son, Napier, wrote to Davenport telling him the sad news;
he said that Sturt's manner was so young and happy that the death was
quite unexpected, and spoke feelingly of his father's gentleness and
kindness.</p>

<p>They lie together in the same grave at Prestbury, near Cheltenham,
under the following tribute:</p>

<p>[ebook editor's note: A representative of the Cheltenham Local History
Society has advised that the address should be:--<br>
"Cheltenham Cemetery and Crematorium,<br>

<p>After his death there was occasional communication from the family.
Lady Sturt wrote to Messrs. Wright Brothers, of Adelaide, concerning
the lease of Grange, which--although occupied by Mr. Baker--who had
"purchased" it in 1847 (see p. 149) was still the property of the Sturt
family,* also making enquiry concerning the "two Wentworth blocks
apparently owned by Captain Sturt." In view of the inscription on the
monumental stone over the grave at Cheltenham it is to be noted that
Lady Sturt, in her correspondence with the Wright Brothers, asks them
to address correspondence to her as "Lady Sturt."</p>

survived her husband for 18 years, and joined him in death on 5th June,

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2><a name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII - Tributes and Memorials</h2>

<p>Many tributes have been paid to Sturt during the eighty years since
his death. The list of his lifelong friends tells its own story. Hume
and Macleay, who saw him under stress, never faltered in a long
friendship. Eyre, then a very old man writing in 18%, spoke of the debt
owing by him in knowledge and friendship: the list could be continued
in a long harmony of testimony to his skill in leadership and the
nobility of his character.</p>

<p>The President of the Royal Geographical Society delivered a memorial
tribute to his work.</p>

<p>Of himself he wrote:</p>

<p>"I never set a value on life for living's sake, and I can say with
truth that I never feared death. I have been ambitious but have never
sought honours. Neither has my ambition been selfish, and I trust I
have given to others the credit they have deserved."</p>

<p>One of the humblest of his associates, Daniel Brock, rated as
"collector" on the last expedition, said of him years afterward (7th
August, 1858):</p>

<p>[13-1] "None but those who were with him could estimate the perils,
the dangers, the difficulties to which on his last expedition he was
exposed.</p>

<p>"Many may have exchanged with Sturt the friendships of domestic
life; but only those who have been with him in his journeys could know
his courage and his coolness. Often when the safety of the whole party
hung upon his next movement, they knew that he would do all that it was
possible for man to do, and they trusted in him."</p>

<p class="ref">[13-1 Life. p.323.]</p>

<p>Nothing, after a hundred years, has come to light which casts the
slightest shadow on these judgments of the man Charles Sturt: every
fresh evidence confirms and enhances them.</p>

<p>Apart from the written testimonies to the character of this great
man, his memory has been honoured in many ways.</p>

<p>His name has been given to a county and a mountain in New South
Wales, to a geographical subdivision (a county which is, appropriately,
along the west bank of the Murray) in South Australia, a geographical
subdivision in Queensland, a Federal Electoral Division, a creek which
crosses the border between Western Australia and the Northern
Territory, a river in South Australia, to the lock on the Murray at
Wentworth, to the main interstate highway from Gundagai to Renmark, and
to one of the main avenues in Canberra, the Australian Capital.</p>

<p>His name also permanently marks one of the two headlands flanking
the southern outlet from Lake Alexandrina.</p>

<p>Some warning should be given about "Sturt trees." There is a local
vague legend of one at Illiliwa near Hay, and of another at Wentworth.
No evidence has been found which would support the authenticity of
either of these. The only two trees known definitely to have been
marked by Sturt are the tree at Poole's grave, the tree (the blaze mark
but not the inscription) at Fort Grey, and the "C.A.E." tree at
Menindie--of which no trace can now be found.</p>

<p>The "H.H." tree near Bourke was marked by Hume</p>

<p>Pictures have been painted by various artists of incidents in
Sturt's journeys.</p>

<p>In 1930 general recognition was given to the centenary of the
journey down the Murray to the sea. The Commonwealth Government issued
a commemorative stamp, and the Geographical and Historical Societies
combined in the erection of memorial cairns at a number of points along
the Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers from Gundagai to the sea.
Photographs of three of these are in this volume.</p>

<p>In 1945 celebrations were held in Adelaide and Broken Hill to mark
the centenary of the Central Australian Expedition: on this occasion
cairns were erected at various points on the route as far as
Innamincka; and a plaque on the front of the Bank of Adelaide, King
William St., Adelaide, indicates the scene of the expedition's
departure on 10th August, 1844.</p>

<p>A striking statute of Sturt stands in Victoria Square, Adelaide.</p>

<p>On 16th June, 1948, the anniversary of Sturt's death, an interesting
ceremony was held at Cheltenham, England. On that day the Mayor of
Cheltenham presented to the Australian High Commissioner, Mr. J.
Beasley, the water bottle carried by Sturt on the Central Australian
Expedition. This bottle was given by Charles Sturt to a taxidermist,
Mr. White: later Mr. White gave it to another taxidermist, Mr. Clarke,
whose widow gave it to the Cheltenham Museum. It is now to be held
permanently by the National Library at Canberra.</p>

<p>In addition to receiving this water bottle, Mr. Beasley unveiled a
plaque on the house at 19 Clarence Square, Cheltenham, and, later,
planted a wattle on Sturt's grave.</p>

<p>It is appropriate to mention in conclusion that, in 1945, the
citizens of Adelaide subscribed to a fund, the proceeds from which were
sent to the Mayor of Cheltenham; who, on behalf of the Council,
undertook to use the money for keeping Sturt's grave in order.</p>

<h2><a name="epi"></a>EPILOGUE</h2>

<p>This is the story of a man of unusual quality. Alert to observe, he
noted and accurately identified the plants and minerals he saw on his
journeys, even to the "wood-opal" in the region of [E-1]
Tibooburra.</p>

<p class="ref">[E-1 Narr. Cent. 1.242.]</p>

<p>Careful in deduction he, the first European to cross this country,
accurately deduced that "during the primeval period, a sea covered the
deserts over which I wandered." With pre-vision, the result of logical
reasoning, he predicted the fate of the Western interior with precision
that has been fully established. Unshakeable in courage and
determination, he completed the tasks he undertook. He was sent to
establish the fate of the Macquarie River, he was sent to put an end to
all speculation about the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers, he was sent
to determine the nature of the Central interior: all these he did with
a thoroughness which left no scope for any who might follow. His
leadership was prudent: he would go to the limits of safety, but not
beyond: his life-line was often stretched very taut but never
broke.</p>

<p>His leadership was humane--the life-long friendship and respect
shown by those who shared all risks with him is evidence enough. His
faith in God was real and, steadfast, his belief in Divine protection
was not affectation--"not to myself do I accord any credit."</p>

<p>It is true that he failed; he failed to find an inland sea; he
failed to secure high official position; at the very last, when an
honourable title was granted, and his hand stretched out to take it,
even then he was denied that last reward. If those were failures--he
failed. But in courage in adversity, in strength of character and
nobility of soul, and, in an enduring memory of these as an inspiration
to all Australians, he did not fail.</p>

<h2><a name="app1"></a>APPENDIX A - Place names given by Sturt</h2>

<p>Sturt makes definite statements concerning the reasons for certain
place names given by him: but concerning others there is not the same
certainty.</p>

<p>The following place-names are definite:</p>

<pre>
Oxley's Table Land       John Oxley
D'Urban's Group          Benjamin D'Urban, name given at the request of Condamine
Dunlop's Range           At Hume's Request
River Darling            Governor Darling
Rufus River              George Macleay
Lindesay River           Colonel Lindesay
Mt. Barker               Captain Barker
Point Macleay            George Macleay
River Murray             Secretary of State Murray
Lake Alexandrina         Queen Victoria
Barrier or Stanley Range Lord Stanley
Mt. Arrowsmith           The cartographer Arrowsmith
Fort Grey                Governor Grey
Cooper's Creek           Judge Cooper
Eyre's Creek             E. J. Eyre
Hamilton's Plains        Surgeon Hamilton (This name is not now used)
</pre>

<p>Beyond this list there is less certainty. There are two sources of
information--the Counsel tracing and the Arrowsmith map. The Counsel
tracing prepared in 1846 from Sturt's own records has the following
names, in addition to those given above:</p>

<pre>
Mt. Darling
Mt. Robe
Mt. Bourke
Mt. King
Mt. Gipps

These are all names of Governors:

Flood's Creek
Lewis Hill
Piesse's Hill
Mt. Poole
Mt. Browne
Mt. Stuart

These are names of members of the expedition:

Morphett's Creek
Campbell's Creek
Burr's Creek
McDonald's Peak
Frome's Creek
Mundy Creek
Torrens' Creek
Blackwood's Peak
Watts' Creek
O'Halloran's Creek
Lake Lipson
Evelyn Creek
Mt. Wood
Stokes' Range

These are all names with Adelaide associations:

Hope's Plains, the origin of which is unknown.

In addition were:

Strzelecki's Creek
Leichhardt's Creek
Macleay's Plains

which explain themselves.
</pre>

<p>[A-1] Mt. Shannon may have been named after the Edinburgh clergyman
mentioned by Sturt in his Narrative of the Central Expedition. The
Arrowsmith map, prepared three years later, while Sturt was in London,
and, therefore probably in consultation with him, contains additional
names:</p>

<p>McLaren Creek<br>
Gairdner Creek.</p>

<p class="ref">[A-1 Narr. 1.16.]</p>

<p>It is not known who named the Mt. Sturt of modern maps--north of Mt.
Poole: the name does not appear on the Arrowsmith map.</p>

<p>As to Grey Range, there is a little confusion. The name does not
appear on the Counsel tracing, on which only the name "Stanley's Range"
appears; but this covers the whole broken country to north of 29
degrees S. latitude. On the Arrowsmith map the name Barrier or Stanley
Range applies as far north as The Pinnacle: but from Mt. Arrowsmith
north the name Grey Range appears.</p>

<p>On modern official maps the name Grey Range is applied only north of
29 degrees S.--the Queensland border. Sturt speaks in his
<i>Narrative</i> of the large interval of low, depressed country
between Stanley's and Grey's Ranges--so it is clear that he authorized
the naming on the Arrowsmith map. Nowhere does he mention the origin of
the name, but as the <i>Narrative</i> is dedicated to Earl Grey,
Stanley's successor, the obvious deduction is reasonable.</p>

<h2><a name="app2"></a>APPENDIX B</h2>

<p>By His Excellency Lieut.-General Ralph Darling.</p>

<p>To Charles Sturt, Esq., Capt. in the 39th Regiment of Foot.</p>

<p>Whereas it has been judged expedient to fit out an expedition for
the purpose of exploring the interior of New Holland, and the present
dry season affords an excellent prospect of ascertaining the nature and
extent of the large marsh or marshes which stopt the progress of the
late John Oxley, Esq., Surveyor-General, in following the courses of
the Rivers Lachlan and Macquarie in the years 1817 and 1818:</p>

<p>And whereas I repose full confidence in your abilities and zeal for
conducting such an expedition I do hereby constitute and appoint you to
command and take charge of the expedition now preparing for the purpose
of exploring the interior of the country and for ascertaining if
practicable the nature and extent of the marsh or marshes above
mentioned.</p>

<p>In the prosecution of this service you will be guided generally by
the following instructions:</p>

<p>(1) You will be accompanied on this expedition by Mr. Hamilton Hume,
whose great experience in travelling through the remote parts of the
country cannot fail to be useful to you. You will also be attended by
two soldiers and six convicts, of whom one is to understand the shoeing
of horses, one to be a carpenter, and one a harness maker, and three
stockmen, and you will be provided with six horses and twelve
bullocks.</p>

<p>(2) A small boat has been built here for the use of the expedition,
and for its conveyance there is provided a light four-wheeled carriage
to be drawn by 2 bullocks. The Deputy Commissioner...has received
orders for supplying the expedition with provisions of the best quality
sufficient for six months' consumption together with Tents, Blankets,
Clothing, Packsaddles, Utensils, Instruments, Tools and necessaries of
all kinds of which you are likely to stand in need: orders are also
given for providing you with arms, ammunition and rockets for signals
and ample supply of simple medicines.</p>

<p>You are to consider it an important duty to attend to the providing
of all these supplies and to take care not only that every article is
of the best quality that can be procured, but also that no article be
wanting with which you may desire to be provided.</p>

<p>(3) Orders are given for forwarding without delay all your
provisions, stores and supplies of any kind to Wellington Valley, at
which place you, Mr. Hume and all your men are to rendezvous as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>Mr. Maxwell, the Superintendent, will furnish you with trained
bullocks and afford you all the assistance you may require in arranging
everything for your departure from the station.</p>

<p>(4) After you shall have completed all your arrangements you are to
lose no time in finally departing from Wellington Valley in prosecution
of the immediate objects of the expedition.</p>

<p>(5) You are first to proceed to Mount Harris where you are to form a
temporary depot by means of which you will have an opportunity of more
readily communicating with Mr. Maxwell.</p>

<p>(6) You are then to endeavour to determine the fate of the Macquarie
River by tracing it as far as possible beyond the point at which Mr.
Oxley went and by pushing westward you are to ascertain if there be any
high lands in that direction or if the country be, as is supposed, an
unbroken level and under water.</p>

<p>If you should fail in those objects you will traverse the plains
lying behind our north-west boundaries with a view to skirt any waters
by which you may have been Checked to the westward and southward as far
as possible endeavouring to discover the Macquarie beyond the marsh of
Mr. Oxley and following it to its mouth if at all practicable.</p>

<p>(7) There is some reason to believe that the overflowing of the
Macquarie when visited by Mr. Oxley was occasioned by the heavy rains
falling in the mountains to the eastward and that as you will visit the
same spot in a different season of the year you may escape such
embarrassment; but although you should get beyond the point at which
Mr. Oxley stopped it would not be prudent to risk your own health and
that of your men by continuing long in a swampy country.' Therefore it
may be advisable for you in the first instance to leave the greater
part of your men, bullocks and baggage at Mount Harris, and if you
should see a probability of your being able to cross into the interior
you will return to Mount Harris for such additional supplies as you may
judge necessary. You can then communicate with Mr. Maxwell respecting
any ulterior arrangements which you may be desirous of making.</p>

<p>(8) The success of the expedition is so desirable an object that I
cannot too strongly impress upon you the importance of perseverance in
endeavouring to skirt any waters or marshes which may check your course
as long as you have provisions sufficient for your return, but you must
be cautious not to proceed a single day's journey further than where
you find that your provisions will be barely sufficient to enable you
to reach the nearest place at which you can depend upon getting further
supplies.</p>

<p>(9) If after every endeavour you should find it totally impossible
to get to the westward you are still to proceed northward, keeping as
westerly a direction as possible, and when the state of your provisions
will oblige you to retreat, you will be guided by your latitude as to
the place to which you are to make the best of your way, but you are
not make for any place on the coast if Wellington Valley should still
be nearer.</p>

<p>(10) You must be aware that the success of the expedition will
greatly depend upon the time for which your provisions will hold out
and therefore you will see the great importance of observing every
possible economy in the expenditure of provisions and preventing waste
of every kind.</p>

<p>(11) You are to keep a detailed account of your proceedings in a
journal in which all observations and occurrences of every kind, with
all their circumstances, however minute, are to be carefully noted
down.</p>

<p>You are to be particular in describing the general face of all the
country through which you pass, the direction and shape of all the
mountains, whether detached or in ranges, together with their bearings
and estimated distances of the several mountains, hills, or eminences
from each other.</p>

<p>You are likewise to note the nature of the climate as to heat, cold,
moisture, winds, rains and to keep a register of the temperature from
Fahrenheit's thermometer as observed at two or three periods each
day.</p>

<p>The rivers, with their several branches, their direction, velocity,
breadth and depth, are carefully to be noted. It is further expected
that you will, as far as may be in your power, attend to the animal,
vegetable and mineral productions of the country, noting down
everything that may occur to you and preserving specimens as far as
your means will permit, especially some of all the ripe seeds that you
may discover. When the preservation of specimens is impossible,
drawings or detailed accounts of them are very desirable.</p>

<p>(12) You will note the description of the several people whom you
may meet, the extent of the population, their names, their means of
subsistence, their genius and disposition, the nature of their
amusements, their diseases and remedies, their objects of worship,
religious ceremonies, and a vocabulary of their language.</p>

<p>Lastly, on your return from your journey, you are to cause all the
journals or other documents belonging to, and curiosities collected by,
the several individuals comprising the expedition, to be carefully
sealed up with your own seal and kept in that state until you shall
have made your report to me in writing of the result of the
expedition.</p>

<h2><a name="app3"></a>APPENDIX C</h2>

<p>Agreement entered into between Charles Sturt and the Parties
employed by him in the service of Her Majesty's Government:</p>

<p>Whereas the Right Honourable Lord Stanley, Her Majesty's Principal
Secretary of State of the Colonies, has directed that an expedition
shall be fitted out to explore the Central Parts of the continent of
Australia, has appointed Charles Sturt, Esquire, to the command of the
said expedition, and has further authorized the said Charles Sturt to
employ such persons as he may consider qualified for such a service, at
the rate of wages and supply of rations hereinafter mentioned.</p>

<p>Be it therefore agreed between the said Charles Sturt and us whose
names are hereto annexed, that, for and in consideration of the sum of
One Pound sterling per week and rations as follows: viz., 10 lbs. of
flour, 2 lbs. of sugar, &frac14; lb. of tea, &frac14; lb. of tobacco
and 2 oz. of soap weekly, we each of us both severally and collectively
agree to accompany the said Charles Sturt on the said Expedition, to
obey all orders by him given, and to conform to the discipline he may
consider necessary, and to this end we engage to take our turn on night
guard, as it shall be established: and we further agree to be diligent
and attentive not only in the duties which may be assigned to us,
individually, but to make ourselves generally useful and to promote to
the best of our ability the success of the Expedition, obeying all the
lawful orders of our superiors and maintaining peace and harmony
amongst ourselves, and we hereby engage to remain with the said Charles
Sturt until the completion of the service for which we are employed, or
until such time as it shall be necesary for him to discharge us: the
said Charles Sturt engaging on his part to defray the expense of our
passage Home should we be discharged at any Port away from the
Province, and whereas no mention of the quantity of meat be allowed for
the weekly ration be it agreed between us and the said Charles Sturt
that so long as it can be supplied the quantity to be issued shall be
ten (10) pounds to each individual of fresh meat, or six (6) pounds of
bacon: but we whose names are hereunto affixed agree to accommodate
ourselves to circumstances, and cheerfully acquiesce in any arrangement
it may be considered necessary to make for our benefit and ultimate
good or when the interests of the Service in which we have engaged
shall require us to do so.</p>

<p>And in default of any of these agreements we hereby consent to have
such portion of our wages forfeited us as in his just discretion the
said Charles Sturt shall determine, and we further agree to obey the
officer who shall succeed the said Charles Sturt in the event of any
unforeseen accident to him occurring the same in all respects as if he
were still our Leader; and, lastly, we bind ourselves to submit with
cheerfulness and resignation to any privations or trials which the
nature of the service or the ordination of Providence may bring upon
us.</p>

<h2><a name="app4"></a>APPENDIX D</h2>

<p>NOTE 1: John Harris, whose name as stated on his marriage
certificate was Joseph Harris, was a private in the 39th Regiment, and
while so serving was "servant" to Sturt. He was married in Ireland and
came to Australia with Sturt. He was with Sturt on both the first and
second expeditions and went with him to Norfolk Island, where the
eldest Harris son was born. In recognition of his services on the two
expeditions he was given a grant of land of 100 acres at West Dapto
(the date of the grant was 6th Dec., 1832): here he settled with his
family becoming a highly respected pioneer of this district. The land
originally granted is still in the possession of the family.</p>

<p>Fraser was also given a grant of land of 100 acres at the same time
as Harris and took up his land next to Harris at West Dapto. However,
he soon sold this land to Harris. He died in 1843 (Life. p. 30).</p>

<p>The information in this note was supplied to me by Miss E. M. Harris
of West Dapto, a granddaughter of Joseph Harris.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: Government Surveyor, A. W. Mullen, in 1915, located the end
point of this journey as the junction of the Gunderbooka or Hume Creek
with the Darling River.</p>

<p>NOTE 3: Speculation as to the extent to which Sturt influenced the
definition of the boundaries of the new province of South Australia is
interesting but, at present, inconclusive. The first occasion which,
has, up till now, been traced upon which specific boundaries were
proposed was a pamphlet (it is presumed to have been prepared by
Wakefield) in which the proposed boundaries for the suggested new
province were 132 deg. to 141 deg. E. longtitude. This pamphlet is
dated 1831, i.e., after Sturt's discovery of the Murray River.</p>

<p>The first information of a reliable kind which could have reached
England was contained in Sturt's letters to his father which left
Sydney in May, 1830. There is sufficient evidence that these had
reached London by November, 1830.</p>

<p>But in the Mitchell Library in Sydney there is an original letter
written by Sturt to the Colonial Secretary Macleay, dated 23rd July,
1830, which contains a long description of the rivers. In this
description space is left for the longitude and latitude of the
Darling-Murray junction, but these have not been inserted.</p>

<p>On 9th June, 1831, Governor Darling sent to England a despatch which
was accompanied by a map prepared by Sturt showing the routes of each
of his expeditions: but there is other evidence to show that Sturt had
not taken longitude observations between the northwest bend at Morgan
and the mouth of the Darling. This map, which cannot now be located
would have reached London by December, 1831, but whether it had any
influence in confirming 141 deg. as the eastern boundary cannot now be
determined.</p>

<p>The first draft charter for the company that was proposing to
establish this new province was dated 28th May, 1832 (Commons paper
129--12/3/1841). This repeated the boundaries 132 deg. to 141 deg.
East. This project remained dormant until the appearance in 1833 of
Sturt's Two Expeditions into the Interior of Southern Australia which
.revived interest and enthusiasm for the proposal to establish a new
colony.</p>

<p>On 17th February, 1834, Sturt wrote a long memorandum at the request
of the Colonial Office in which he gave his views as to the suitability
for colonization of this region. In this he accepts the proposed
boundaries 132-141 without comment.</p>

<p>On the whole the evidence at present available does not suggest that
Sturt personally influenced the definition of the boundaries, but it is
difficult to avoid the conclusion that the geographical range of his
discoveries (especially the discovery of the Murray mouth) following
upon the charting of the coastline by Flinders, influenced the minds of
those who first suggested the definition which was ultimately
adopted.</p>

<p>NOTE 4: The Cutter Dart had been ordered to sea from Sydney on 16th
February with instructions to search for Sturt: but this was clearly
too late. Sturt was well on his way home before the vessel even left
Sydney.</p>

<p>NOTE 5: Dr. George Bennett (Wanderings in New South Wales, etc. Vol.
I, p. 240), who visited the region in the summer of 1832-33 quotes the
following stations then in existence; the order of sequence is
downstream from Warby's along the Murrumbidgee:</p>

<p>NOTE 6: Grenfell Price in his Founders and Pioneers of South
Australia speaks of the Commissioners having sent out "Frome, whom they
appointed Surveyor-General, regardless of the permanent appointments
which Gawler must obviously have made in order to secure competent
officials" and, later (loc. cit. pp. 146-7) he refers to, and quotes,
written authority given to Gawler.</p>

<p>Sturt, himself, in his Memorial to the Lords Commissioners of the
Treasury expressly relied on these written authorities. He said:</p>

<p>"Colonel Gawler at the same time made your memorialist acquaintd
with his instructions and the authority on which he was proceeding to
reorganize the Survey Department, which left no doubt either on your
Memorialist's mind or of the friends with whom he consulted of the
power given to the Governor to secure the services of a competent
officer and to appoint him permanently Surveyor-General contingent on
the approval of Her Majesty's Government."</p>

<p>It has to be noted that Sturt's appointment was gazetted in Adelaide
on 2nd February, 1839--the post having been offered by Gawler in
November, 1838. But the authorities quoted by Price were written in
London in 1839 so they could not have any relation to this
appointment.</p>

<p>What, then of Sturt's own statement that Gawler had "at the same
time" (i.e., November, 1838) made known the authority on which he was
proceeding to reorganise the Survey Department undoubtedly giving
Gawler power to make a permanent appointment.</p>

<p>The following is the full text of that authority:</p>

<p>"Yesterday the Colonization Commissioners received a despatch from
the Resident Commissioner dated Adelaide July 14th stating that the
Surveyor-General had resigned and that his resignation had been
followed by that of the greater part of the Assistant Surveyors.</p>

<p>"Under these circumstances the Commissioners are desirous of
placing, and do hereby place, in your hands, the fullest and most ample
powers to reorganise the surveying staff in whatever manner and to
whatever extent may appear to you most expedient in order to render it
efficient and to remedy as far as may be practicable the interruption
and delay in the progress of the surveys which these resignations will
have occasioned.</p>

<p>"Reposing the fullest confidence in your zeal, energy and discretion
the Commissioners will not attempt to fetter or impede the free
exercise of your judgment by prescribing instructions or by tracing out
any particular course of proceeding for your guidance. The objects to
be attained are, to expedite the surveys and to place the purchasers of
land upon their locations with the least possible delay and the
Commissioners have only to request that the arrangements which you may
make for their attainment may be regarded as provisional and temporary
so that it may be left open to the Board, when further information
shall be received, to determine upon what scale the surveying staff
shall be permanently established. The Commissioners hereby authorise
you to incur any additional expense on account of the survey which you
may deem essential whether it be by increasing the strength of the
surveying staff from the neighbouring colonies, or in contracting with
private surveyors for the rapid execution of an given quantity of
work."</p>

<p>The sequence of events is interesting. The memorandum just quoted
was dated 2nd December, 1838--it could not have reached Adelaide before
May, 1839, and was actually not written until after Gawler had offered
the post to Sturt.</p>

<p>Frome did not arrive until 18th September, 1839, so Sturt, between
May and September must have been aware of the contents of this
memorandum. In view, too, of the gazette notice which qualified his
appointment "until Her Majesty's pleasure be known" it must have been
known to all concerned that the appointment was not final.</p>

<p>The facts were all reviewed in the reply by the Colonial Land and
Emigration Commissioners to Sturt's Memorial of 1843 and they concluded
that (referring to the letter above quoted) "the appointment cannot be
said to have proceeded on that authoriy...the letter in plain terms
restricted the Resident Commissioner to temporary measures." It seems
clear that Start, when preparing his Memorial four years later, had
become a little uncertain as to the sequence of events.</p>

<p>NOTE 7: There is a little uncertainty as to the time when this vase
was presented.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sturt (Life, p. 186) assumes it to have been in 1840 when he
left his short-lived appointment as Surveyor-General: but in a letter
written to Lady Darling (14th September, 1847) written when he was
about to leave Adelaide on a visit to England, Sturt said:</p>

<p>"The Survey Department of which I was for a time the head presented
me with a beautiful silver vase, and my friends eagerly anticipated my
wants on board, and sent me sheep and poultry and other things."</p>

<p>The real date, however, was well before 1847.</p>

<p>NOTE 8: The story of the negotiations preceding approval for Sturt's
Central Australia (1844-46) Expedition is, in outline, as follows:</p>

<p>Sturt wrote (25th January, 1843) to Stanley:</p>

<p>"...I would engage, natural and unconquerable obstacles excepted, to
traverse the Australian continent from East to West, and from north to
south in two years."</p>

<p>He followed this letter with another (16th March, 1843) in which he
said:</p>

<p>"If a line be drawn from Latitude 29 deg. 30 min. and, Longitude 144
deg. to the N.W. and another from Mt. Arden due north they would meet a
little to the northward of the tropics and there, my Lord, I will be
bound to say a fine country will one day or other be discovered."</p>

<p>In this second letter are indications that Sturt had of his own
impulse rather modified the extensive plan suggested in his first
letter.</p>

<p>On the office files in the Colonial Office (papers now in Public
Records Office) is a minute signed by Stanley in which appears:</p>

<p>"When Captain Sturt speaks of traversing the Continent from north to
south and from east to west in two years a glance at the map...is
sufficient to throw considerable doubt on the feasibility of such an
enterprise. I feel that...I must withhold the sanction of the
Government for so rash an undertaking at least until I shall have
received your opinion as to Captain Sturt's present state of
health...and a more detailed explanation from Captain Sturt
himself..."</p>

<p>This memorandum is dated 13th September. Sturt's proposals were
submitted to Sir John Barrow who submitted comments (undated) in which
appear the following:</p>

<p>"Having looked over the plan proposed by Mr. Sturt for the
exploration of the interior of Australia it appears to me to comprehend
a great deal more than he or any other human being could by any
possibility accomplish in two years or in any number of years on one
continued expedition...I know Mr. Sturt to be an intelligent and
anxious man for discovery; and I am persuaded that if the object he has
in view could be effected he is the man to undertake it...There is,
however, a portion of the Continent of Australia that may be
accomplished in a reasonable time and at a moderate expense."</p>

<p>Barrow then outlined the proposal to examine the possibility of a
watershed north-west from the Darling--the route to be due north from
Mt. Arden.</p>

<p>There is a side-line note on the original of this memorandum signed
by Stanley referring to the question of the route to be followed:</p>

<p>"On this point, I think great latitude should be allowed to the
explorer."</p>

<p>It is very doubtful whether this decision was conveyed to Sturt as
in a letter to King, written from Adelaide on 11th August, 1844, the
day of his departure on this expedition, he said:</p>

<p>"I am directed to go due north of Mt. Arden."</p>

<p>But even while he was writing this letter to King, his party had
already set out to follow the Murray-Darling route.</p>

<p>NOTE 9: There is a reasonable probability that the inscription
"Sturt, 1845" was cut by Governor Surveyor, A. W. Mullen, when he made
an official visit to the Fort Grey location in 1923.</p>

<p>I am indebted for this hint to Mr. John Stokie, of Broken Hill,
whose uncle, Mr. Thomas Stokie, accompanied Mr. Mullen at the latter's
request, and pointed out the tree which was already marked.</p>

<p>Mr. Mullen on his return to Sydney sent Mr. Stokie the two volumes
of Sturt's Central Australian Expedition narrative as a memento of this
journey. The field books used by Mr. Mullen in his 1923 survey of the
Lake Pinneroo area are still held at the offices of the Western Lands
Commission in Sydney. They contain no reference to this tree.</p>
