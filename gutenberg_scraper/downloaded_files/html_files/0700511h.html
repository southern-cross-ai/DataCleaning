<h1>The Man Who Passed</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Edgar Wallace</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>MR. MANNERING was called "the Captain" in the village of Woodern
Green, which is on the southern edge of Buckingham. Possibly because of
his military appearance and the frigidity of his manner; though why
captains are supposed to be frigid nobody knows.</p>

<p>He lived at Hexleigh Manor, which was a small house in a large park,
and by all accounts he was a gentleman who had no great store of money.
The Manor was something of a derelict when he rented it at a
ridiculously low sum. The repairs upon which previous would-be tenants
had insisted were apparently executed by the new tenant without the
assistance of local builders, according to their account.</p>

<p>The captain had a staff of three, two of whom lived in the house and
the third in a cottage within the grounds. They were three hard-faced
men, who never came to the village, and it was believed that they were
old soldiers who had served with the captain during the war.</p>

<p>It was to the cottage that all the provisions were delivered by
local tradesmen--none of them was invited to go farther. The bills were
paid weekly by cheque on a London bank.</p>

<p>One curious circumstance: no letters, save the inevitable appeals by
secretaries of local working men's cricket, football or other clubs,
were ever addressed to Captain or Mr. Mannering. He seemed to have no
friends.</p>

<p>He had been there a year when he blossomed forth into something
grander than an impecunious military gentleman. Vans arrived from
London filled with expensive furniture; the dour man at the cottage
engaged three gardeners; a local builder was called in to decorate the
house, and an era of prosperity set in.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder, of the Public Prosecutor's Department, became acquainted
with Hexleigh Manor in a peculiar way. His hobby, as all the world
knows, was chickens. He had a big poultry farm in Kent, and raised the
choicest and the rarest birds in the kingdom. The stocking of the
Hexleigh Manor poultry farm--a new branch of Captain Mannering's
activities--brought down Mr. Reeder in his capacity of poultry
expert.</p>

<p>Captain Mannering was in town--he drove to London almost every day
in his closed sedan car--and the caller saw only the new poultry man,
who was talkative. When the business was at an end Mr. Reeder climbed
up into the seat of the little van which had brought him and his birds
from London, and drove down the drive. His profit on the transaction
was microscopic, but the satisfaction he had as a poultry fancier was
of infinitely greater importance.</p>

<p>They passed the cottage, outside which the surly servant of the
establishment was smoking. He looked up and Mr. Reeder saw him. He did
not notice the angular man who sat beside the driver.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Mr. Reeder, mildly surprised, for he had seen the
cottager before.</p>

<p>He had a motto, which was that one should live honestly and let
others live honestly, which is not quite the same as the less elaborate
adage. But he was also very curious, and curiosity can be a nuisance to
all sorts of people.</p>

<p>At Scotland Yard they called him "lucky," and pointed out amazing
coincidences that had helped him to the solution of important
mysteries; but Mr. Reeder used to suggest that he was responsible for
all the coincidences that helped him.</p>

<p>In his spare time he came to Woodern Green and made a few inquiries,
not because he expected that the results would be of any service to
him, but because he wished to know. Knowledge was his working capital,
and he would go to great trouble in its gathering. He hoarded facts as
some women hoard scraps of silk, or mechanics hoard nuts and screws and
odd nails and useless scraps of machine parts, not because they were of
any immediate use, but because, some day...</p>

<p>His chief asked about his visit to Bucks, and Mr. Reeder sighed.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately I have--um--a very bad mind. I see--er--the worst, as
it were, in everybody and the most--um--sinister meanings in the most
innocent things--in fact, I have the mind of a criminal. Had I the
courage, which of course I have not, I should have made--um--an
interesting lawbreaker."</p>

<p>His superior smiled.</p>

<p>"Good. Go down and see that pompous gentleman at Mabberleys
to-morrow and expound what your criminal instincts suggest for the
better protection of his business."</p>

<p>So Mr. Reeder, in his mild way, quarrelled with a great man and
later was by premeditation offensive to one who was not so great. The
great man was Sir Wilfred Heinhall, K.B.E., and the rest of it. He was
director of seventeen corporations and chairman of eight of these. He
knew everything about business and economics, and trade balances and
world conditions, but he didn't know much about men.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder went down to the City, representing the Public
Prosecutor, and in the course of a conversation which had as its
subject the prosecution of an unfaithful servant, suggested that the
methods of this particular corporation were rather antiquated.</p>

<p>"If I--er--may be permitted to offer the view--um--your checking
system leaves--er--much to be desired."</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense!" said Sir Wilfred. "Are you telling me how to
conduct my business? Did the Public Prosecutor send you down here to
lecture ME on Filing Systems? Good heavens!"</p>

<p>He said a lot more, and Mr. Reeder said nothing much. There were few
opportunities. He went meekly forth into the city street and boarded a
bus that deposited him near to the Home Office.</p>

<p>It was in the afternoon, when he was leaving Whitehall, that he had
occasion to stop a gentleman in the street. The gentleman did not wish
to stop, but Mr. Reeder hooked his arm with the crook of his umbrella
and pulled him back. It was a shockingly undignified action on the part
of a reputable man, but Mr. Reeder did it with all the aplomb of a
music-hall performer.</p>

<p>"What are you doing in town, Mr. Higson?" he asked.</p>

<p>The good-looking man of forty, brought to a standstill so
unceremoniously, looked murder and smiled.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Reeder--"</p>

<p>"Mister Reeder," murmured the detective. "What is the game--snide or
just ordinary thieving?"</p>

<p>Higson was well dressed, but that was part of his graft. Nobody
could remember seeing Hymie Higson looking anything but in the bandbox
class. He had a gold cigarette box in his pocket, and his watch-guard
looked platinum and probably was.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you." Hymie's tone was neither respectful nor humble.
"When you put me in with your damned perjury I had a snug bit of money
put away. That breaks your so-and-so heart, you dirty old
something-or-other! Fifteen thousand quid! I've done my time and you
can't touch it. I'm going straight because I can afford to go
straight--if I couldn't afford to, I'd be selling snide fivers and
making a good living, and this time you wouldn't catch me, you
old--"</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder tapped him on the ear with the heavy handle of his
umbrella. It wasn't a heavy tap, but it was painful, and Hymie's hand
went up with a cry.</p>

<p>"Don't be rude," said Mr. Reeder mildly, "or I'll trip you on to
your back and push the ferrule of my umbrella into your right eye--or
left eye, whichever is most convenient."</p>

<p>There was in Mr. Reeder something cold-bloodedly ferocious which
Hymie suddenly remembered. He blinked at the detective, still holding
his ear, and then abruptly turned and hurried away.</p>

<p>"Very curious," said Mr. Reeder.</p>

<p>But it was not so curious as the incident of the parlourmaid.</p>

<p>Few people would have given a thought to the parlourmaid. Certainly
there was nothing in her appearance or manner to stimulate an interest
in her relations. She was plain, long-faced and anaemic; her legs were
broomsticks, her feet grotesquely large. Mr. Reeder was conscious of
her long before she was completely conscious of Mr. Reeder.</p>

<p>She dusted his room with amazing caution, broke nothing that was
valuable, made no attempt to tidy up his desk, was never in the way.
She thought of him as "elderly," wondered why he was so old-fashioned
as to wear square-topped felt hats and square-toed boots, and why he
didn't shave his side-whiskers. All this in a vague way. She was never
realty interested in Mr. Reeder until his housekeeper told her he was a
detective.</p>

<p>"Him?" incredulously.</p>

<p>"Mr. Reeder," said the housekeeper, more correctly.</p>

<p>"A copper?" definitely sceptical.</p>

<p>"Not a policeman, though he goes to Scotland Yard a lot--he's in the
government."</p>

<p>"Good Gawd!" said the housemaid.</p>

<p>Her name was Elizabeth, and she was of the class that shortens that
stately name to Lizzie.</p>

<p>She pondered on Mr. Reeder after that, surveyed him furtively,
craned her head out of upstairs windows to see him "come from
business," dangling his closely furled umbrella and playing with his
eye-glasses.</p>

<p>The question of Ena very naturally came into close association with
Mr. Reeder. Ena's Ernie was Lizzie's absorbing problem. Ena was lovely,
with a skin like ivory and teeth like white porcelain. She had the
figure of a sylph and legs that people used to turn in the street to
look at again. She was Lizzie's sister--nobody quite understood how
this came about. Ena had worked in the City, where she had earned some
fifty shillings a week for typing letters all of which began: "In reply
to yours of even date." Now she didn't work anywhere; lived at home in
a room which she had had specially furnished; drove hither and thither
in taxi-cabs, and once or twice had come home in a beautiful car. On
her fingers were two all too lovely diamond rings. She had three
evening dresses, and withal was respectable. For Ena was engaged to be
married to a young gentleman of fortune named Ernie Molyneux. He lived
in the country, and came to town or to Brighton only for week-ends.</p>

<p>There was nothing odd about this engagement. Mr. Molyneux was a
young and pallid man of twenty-six, slightly chinless but otherwise
goodish looking. He was madly in love with Ena, whom he had met at a
cinema and had brought home by train, calling upon her parents and
being asked into the parlour and asked his views about the weather and
the state of trade. And since he had given satisfactory replies to
these questions, and had passed the test which mother always applied
and had answered that he did not go much to church nowadays, but that
he had sung in the choir, he was accepted. This was before his uncle in
Australia died and left him all his money, and consequently before the
taxi-cabs and the diamond rings.</p>

<p>There was nothing about this which worried Lizzie Panton. It was the
advent of the gentleman from the West End which had disturbed the
Panton household. He was a gentleman wearing evening dress and a heavy
black moustache and dark-rimmed eye-glasses. He had come to Friendly
Street, where the Pantons lived, at twelve o'clock one Saturday night.
The Pantons were all in bed except Lizzie. She was washing out some
stockings and things--being a "daily" she had little chance of doing
her own work-- and she it was who answered the knock.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to bother you," said the stranger in a deep, aristocratic
voice (the description is Lizzie's); "but is this Mr. Panton's
house?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lizzie.</p>

<p>"Is that Ena?"</p>

<p>The stranger took a step into the passage and peered at her.</p>

<p>"No--Lizzie."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>"You're the slav--the servant girl?"</p>

<p>Lizzie knew that he had been on the point of saying "slavey" and
bridled.</p>

<p>"I'm parlourmaid at Mr. Reeder's," she said.</p>

<p>After a longer pause he made her repeat that. "At Mr. Reeder's--which
Mr. Reeder?"</p>

<p>"In Brockley Road."</p>

<p>She heard the quick intake of his breath. "Really! Is Ena at
home?"</p>

<p>"She's just gone to bed. Is anything wrong with Ernie?"</p>

<p>The stranger hesitated.</p>

<p>"No; you're her sister, aren't you?" And, when Lizzie admitted the
fact: "Ernest and she wrote out a paper to-night--a sort of
advertisement. That must not appear."</p>

<p>Ena had come home early that night and the advertisement had been
very completely discussed. As a matter of fact, it was Lizzie's idea
originally to announce the engagement. "It will tie him down," she had
said. And it had been "agreed," as the lawyers say, in this form:</p>

<p>"A marriage has been arranged and will shortly take place between
Mr. Ernest Jakes Molyneux of Overdean, Birmingham, and Miss Ena Panton
of Brockley."</p>

<p>Now, Friendly Street is distinctly in Deptford, but Ena thought
Brockley was more respectable. "Has it been posted?"</p>

<p>"No, it hasn't," said Lizzie. "Wait a bit, I'll see Ena--won't you
come in?"</p>

<p>No, he wouldn't come in. He preferred the unlighted passage way.
Presently Ena came down in her new dressing-gown. She was a little
peevish, for Ernie had been rather trying that night--shilly-shallying
about the notice.</p>

<p>"Who are you, anyway?" she demanded. "I am Ernie's guardian," said
the stranger.</p>

<p>It was evident to the shrewd Lizzie that he was controlling his
impatience with an effort.</p>

<p>"I think the announcement is absolutely unnecessary, and it may
spoil his chances with his other uncle, who doesn't want him to
marry."</p>

<p>Ena was impressed. Her young man had not mentioned any other uncle,
but uncles are an unlimited commodity.</p>

<p>"All right, I'll tear it up," she said reluctantly. "I was putting
it in the <i>Kentish Mercury</i>, but if you don't think it's
right--"</p>

<p>"May I have the paper that Ernest wrote?"</p>

<p>She had it upstairs, and, going up, brought it to him. Lizzie
watched him walk back to the end of the street, where a taxi-cab was
waiting for him, and then came in and shut the door.</p>

<p>"It's very funny," she said.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> funny," agreed her sister. "Ouch!" She gave a little
scream.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"I put my foot on a mouse or something!" panted the pretty sister,
who was bare-footed. "Stuff! Mouse!"</p>

<p>Lizzie reached up and lit the gas. It was not a mouse--it was a
furry something of familiar shape. Stooping down, she picked it up.</p>

<p>"A false moustache--why, that was what he was wearing!" she
gasped.</p>

<p>The two girls looked at one another in amazement.</p>

<p>"That's funny," said Lizzie again.</p>

<p>Ena sat up half the night, writing to her boy. She often wrote, but
he never replied by letter except once when she had had a note posted
in mid-week in Birmingham. Her letters were invariably addressed to a
place off the Haymarket which she discovered was a block of service
flats. The "funniest" thing of all was that that same week came a
letter from Ernie, saying that everything was a mistake, and that,
though he loved her, it was best for everybody if they parted. He told
her to keep all the presents he had given to her.</p>

<p>Ena wept, of course. She made a personal call at West End Mansions,
to learn that Mr. Molyneux had given up his flat and had left no
instructions as to where his letters were to be sent.</p>

<p>To Lizzie the crux of the mystery was that false moustache, until it
was superseded by the second mystery. It was a letter addressed to
Ena--a wild, more or less incoherent, adoring letter. It was from Ernie
and bore the postmark, Birmingham Central, and no address. It was
written on scraps of paper evidently torn from larger sheets.</p>

<p>"I love you more than anything...can't stop thinking about you...You
alone could save my soul from the tyrant who is sucking my blood...If I
could only see you and explain everything--but no, he stands behind me
and it's all oil, oil, oil...Sometimes I wake up and say to myself
suppose it's a lie. How can you tell if you're not on the ground? You
can't <i>see</i> oil. I've read up the Encyclopaedia and it doesn't say
anything like that. Only eight weeks to the thirty-first--what horrible
thoughts possess me! It is the Inspector's fault. If he had done his
duty the first time he would have seen through it, instead of which he
was in a hurry to catch his train."</p>

<p>"I can't make head or tail of it," sniffed Ena.</p>

<p>"Except that he loves you," said her homely sister.</p>

<p>"I knew that," said Ena.</p>

<p>No further letter came from Ernie. One day Lizzie took her courage
in both hands and carried the letter and the moustache to Mr.
Reeder.</p>

<p>She chose an occasion which was favourable. It happened to be an
evening off, and Mr. Reeder was dozing before the fire. She began an
introduction which was full of "I hope you will excuse me, sir's" and
"I don't know whatever you will think of me's."</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder blinked himself awake.</p>

<p>"Dear me, what is all this about?" he asked benevolently.</p>

<p>He then observed the parlourmaid for the first time.</p>

<p>"It's about my sister, sir," said Lizzie breathlessly. Mr. Reeder
straightened himself, drew up to his desk and put on his glasses.</p>

<p>"About your sister--yes?"</p>

<p>He had a very extensive knowledge of Lizzie's class, and realised
that, though it might be a very small matter, it was tremendous for
her. A very conventional tragedy, perhaps, the sort of thing that
breaks hearts daily in small and unimportant houses.</p>

<p>"It's her young man," began Lizzie, and told her disconnected story,
reserving till the last the grand denouement of the false
moustache.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder listened, forgot nothing, filled in gaps, and could have
recited the whole history of Ena's love affair without flaw, and much
more accurately than could her breathless sister.</p>

<p>"May I see the letter and the moustache?" he asked.</p>

<p>She produced these articles from her apron pocket and laid them on
the table.</p>

<p>"I haven't told Ena about the letter--I mean, taking it away--but I
knew she kept it in the top left-hand drawer..."</p>

<p>There were some things which surprised Mr. Reeder in the story;
there were some which did not surprise him at all. The paper the letter
was written on, for example. He would have been surprised if it had
been any other kind of paper. The moustache set him frowning. It was
very well made, something better than one can buy in shops, the product
of an expert theatrical wig-maker. There was gum on the upper edge of
it, unevenly applied, and not the spirit gum which should have been
applied.</p>

<p>He asked her many questions, few of which she could answer. In fact,
he never seemed to stop asking questions, about all sorts of odd
matters which had no bearing upon Ena's lover and the false moustache.
Had Ernie given the girl money? Had Ena ever met the man with the
moustache in Ernie's company, or anybody who might be he? Did Ernie
ever talk about going abroad, to America, perhaps?</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder was amazingly interested, much more than she had ever
expected him to be, in the love affair of her sister. Ernie was a nice
chap, she explained.</p>

<p>"Is that his writing?"</p>

<p>He tapped the letter.</p>

<p>"Are you sure it's his writing?"</p>

<p>Lizzie was absolutely sure; she had seen his writing before. No, Ena
had never received letters from him, but once he had written something
in Ena's autograph book.</p>

<p>"Did you see him write it?" asked Mr. Reeder eagerly.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"How did he hold his pen like this?" Mr. Reeder seized a
pen-holder. "And before he wrote did he make one or two flourishes like
this?"</p>

<p>He sent the point of the pen twirling round before it dropped to the
paper, and Lizzie gaped at him.</p>

<p>"That's just what he did do!" she said. "I said to Ma at the time,
by way of a joke, 'He doesn't know what to write, so he's sort of
marking time--'"</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder nodded.</p>

<p>"That's what he was doing, marking time."</p>

<p>"Do you want to know what he wrote in the autograph book?"</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder hesitated for a fraction of a second. "Well--er--yes," he
said.</p>

<p>It was quite unimportant, but he would be interested to know.</p>

<p>Ernie had written a little bit of poetry about the advantage of a
young lady being good rather than clever, and doing noble things not
thinking about them.</p>

<p>"Very--um--admirable," said Mr. Reeder,</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>TO say that he was interested was to understate Mr. Reeder's
emotions. There was no mystery here except the mystery of Ernie's
identity. And the greater mystery, more difficult to probe, who was the
man with the aristocratic voice and the moustache who came down to
Deptford, knocking up respectable people at twelve o'clock at night in
order to prevent the insertion of an advertisement? Had she a copy of
this? Lizzie could claim triumphantly that she had written it down word
for word in an old memorandum book, and had it at home.</p>

<p>"What I think is this, sir," she said. "This young man is trying to
give our Ena the go-by. When I say 'him' I mean perhaps his father or
his mother--especially his mother. You know what these people are--they
think their sons are marrying beneath them, when really they're
marrying a heart of gold. I always say there's more happy marriages
amongst the lower classes than amongst the upper classes. Look at the
divorce courts--"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Mr. Reeder absently. "I am sure. Though personally
I-- um--never look at divorce courts at all. But I am certain you're
right."</p>

<p>He rose from his chair and began to stride up and down the room
slowly, his hands in his pockets, his shoulders down, a frown on his
classic face.</p>

<p>"Another thing," Lizzie went on, conscious of the impression she had
made. "Suppose they stopped his allowance, they've got enough to live
on in a quiet way for years--I mean, Ena's jewellery. It's worth two or
three hundred pounds--"</p>

<p>"Could I see Ena? I suppose she knows you've come?" interrupted Mr.
Reeder.</p>

<p>Lizzie felt and looked guilty.</p>

<p>"Well, to tell you the truth," she said awkwardly, "she doesn't.
What she'll say when I tell her I've been to a detective I can't abear
to think."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Tell her," he said gently, "and bring her to see me to-morrow
evening about this time. And ask her--um--to bring any other letters
she may have. I--er--shall read them with the greatest sympathy and
understanding."</p>

<p>He wanted to keep the letters which Lizzie already had, but she was
firm on the point, and carried them off with her.</p>

<p>She spent the greater part of the night sitting up in bed,
persuading her sister to see Mr. Reeder. Ena had been shocked, rather
shrilly reproachful, had accused Lizzie of being underhand and sly,
finally had wept and surrendered.</p>

<p>The next night she came to see Mr. Reeder's house with greater
willingness because in the course of the day a further communication,
even more mysterious, had been received from Ernie. It was a registered
letter, containing three notes each for a hundred pounds, and a very
short letter.</p>

<p>"When you get a wire from me giving a certain address say nothing to
anybody, burn the wire and come straight to me. I cannot live without
you. Go to Cook's and get a passport at once. Don't tell mother or Liz,
but the clouds are breaking."</p>

<p>On the back of the letter was scrawled in pencil a long column of
figures, evidently written in haste. They totalled to 310,740.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder was not the kind of man that Ena had expected to meet. In
truth, he was not the kind of man that anybody expected to meet; and he
had long since classified new acquaintances as those who were
disappointed when they first met him, and those who were relieved. Ena
was in the relieved class.</p>

<p>He was very kindly and gentle, and not at all the hectoring,
bullying detective she had expected. He asked her a lot of questions,
very delicately put; questions which she did not realise were questions
at all until afterwards; and she told him much more than she had ever
imagined she could tell anybody. She was very fond of Ernie; she liked
him ever so much; he had always been the gentleman, and, except that
she had once heard certain reports, had never displayed the least
inclination to fastness.</p>

<p>"He only had to tell me he didn't want me, and I would have
understood," she said.</p>

<p>"But he does want you," said Mr. Reeder gently; "although I am
afraid--" He shook his head.</p>

<p>"You don't think he means that?" asked the girl anxiously. "I mean,
about going out there to him, and the passport?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think he means that," said Mr. Reeder slowly. "I was
thinking of something else. Um."</p>

<p>"I don't know really why I should be making a fuss at all," said
Ena, jerking up her pretty chin. "It seems awful to tell all these
things to strangers. I suppose his parents are against the match. But
after all we've got to live our own lives, haven't we, Mr. Reeder? I
mean, I believe in honouring your father and mother, but you can carry
that sort of thing too far."</p>

<p>J. G. Reeder neither agreed nor disagreed.</p>

<p>"Did he ever tell you he was taking you abroad?" he asked.</p>

<p>Ena shook her head.</p>

<p>"Or tell you any place where you were likely to spend your--um--
honeymoon?"</p>

<p>Ena had to admit that they had never discussed honeymoons. She said
vaguely that she had kept him off the subject.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder rubbed his nose, a little embarrassed. "So you can't tell
me anything about any foreign towns you were likely to visit?"</p>

<p>She shook her head, and was within measurable distance of losing
patience with him; for it seemed to her that the question of a suitable
spot for a honeymoon was a little superfluous in view of the fact that
she might not be having a honeymoon at all.</p>

<p>She had all the propriety of her class.</p>

<p>"Naturally I couldn't go out to him unless mother came with me," she
said.</p>

<p>"Naturally," murmured Mr. Reeder.</p>

<p>She knew nothing about Ernie except that he was a gentleman. He had
never spoken to her about work; that he was wealthy, three hundred
pounds' worth of bank-notes testified. He stayed in Birmingham because
he "had something to do with works." But what those works were, or
where he had his private residence, she could offer no explanation.</p>

<p>"The point is this," said Ena hotly; "I don't allow any man to make
a fool of me. If Ernie's given me up because I'm not good enough for
his mother and father, there's as good fish--"</p>

<p>"In the sea as ever came out," suggested Mr. Reeder. "I think you're
perfectly right."</p>

<p>He took up the little moustache and fingered it, asked her a number
of questions about the height, the voice and the dress of the visitor.
He was in evening dress, she thought. She had never seen him before or
since.</p>

<p>As she walked home with her sister she discussed, not without
acerbity, the waste of her time.</p>

<p>"I must say he's not my idea of a detective," she said, "with his
hums and his haws and his ridiculous questions. He never once so much
as looked at my rings to see if they were genuine."</p>

<p>"You know they're genuine," retorted Lizzie tartly.</p>

<p>Her sister was rather inclined to agree that Mr. Reeder had been a
disappointment. He had hardly looked at the false moustache, which she
had hoped would have struck him all of a heap, and had said practically
nothing about it except that it was well made.</p>

<p>"And he's got a nerve to keep my letters!" fumed Ena, her sense of
grievance growing.</p>

<p>"It's only one letter, and I can get it in the morning by asking for
it," said Lizzie.</p>

<p>"Did I get it to-night by asking for it?" stormed the pretty little
virago. "If that's the kind of man you're working for, I should change
my job."</p>

<p>Lizzie said nothing. Already there was moving in her mind a very
uneasy suspicion, and it was not directed to her employer.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder went to his office the next morning with quite a lot to
think about. It was very rarely that he hadn't. All the way up to
town--he invariably travelled by tramcar--he turned over and over in
his mind the problem of the parlourmaid's sister and her eccentric
lover. Though he could not place his finger at the moment upon Ernie,
he knew all about him, and just what that letter meant.</p>

<p>He was at some pains to explain the situation to the Assistant
Public Prosecutor, who listened with interest to the theories he
expounded. When Mr. Reeder had finished he shook his head.</p>

<p>"One could initiate inquiries, of course, but I doubt if that's our
job. You might pass a note over to the chief constable, who may care to
pursue the matter, but it is certainly not for us. The question will
come to this department quite soon enough."</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder agreed, but he did not send any particulars to Scotland
Yard, not even when he was called in for consultation on a matter which
was that day, and for many weeks, to be the top-liner in every
newspaper which loved a good mystery.</p>

<p>In reality it was a group of mysteries, each having no association
with the other. The first was the affair of the Eton master. Mr.
Friston was a Master of Arts, a man who was known to hold very strong
and definite views on most subjects, particularly on the question of
trade with Russia. He had spoken on this subject at important meetings
in London, and his views had become so pronounced, so uncompromising,
that he had been requested by his college authorities to limit his
oratorical activities.</p>

<p>The master was a man of forty-eight, strong, active, and in one
sense eccentric. It was his habit to rise at an unconscionably early
hour. It was his boast that the maximum amount of sleep he required was
five hours a day, and since it was his practice to go to bed at about
nine o'clock every night, he was usually to be found working in his
study at three o'clock in the morning, after a brisk walk through the
deserted streets of Windsor. The Windsor police knew his habits, and
when he came swinging past them, with a cheery "Good-morning," at an
hour when modern folks were calling upon a dance band for an encore,
they offered him only the polite attention which they were prepared to
afford to Windsor Castle itself.</p>

<p>On this particular morning there was a light ground mist, but Mr.
Friston was recognised by a policeman who stood under the shadow of the
castle wall as he swung down the hill towards Eton. He turned to the
left, and was not seen again until the policeman who had originally
seen him was patrolling towards the college. By this time the mist had
changed into a slight drizzle of rain. It was a quarter-past three when
the slowly patrolling policeman, smoking a surreptitious cigarette,
saw, lying half on the sidewalk and half in the road, the figure of a
man. He hurried forward and flashed his light on its face. To his
horror, he recognised the master.</p>

<p>Summoning assistance and an ambulance, the unconscious man was
rushed to the hospital, where he was found to be suffering from
concussion.</p>

<p>Searching the roadway, the police made a sensational discovery. This
was no less than a bloodstained spanner--a long, narrow tool,
peculiarly suitable to the purpose for which it had evidently been
employed. It lay within a yard of where the unconscious man had been
found. It was immediately packed in tissue paper and reserved for
examination.</p>

<p>The Chief Constable of Berkshire, who had been communicated with,
called in Scotland Yard; and this precaution was justified, for Mr.
Friston died at noon without ever regaining consciousness or giving the
slightest clue as to his assailant.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder went down to Windsor with a small party of C.I.D. men,
saw the body and the weapon. There was no question whatever that the
spanner had been the instrument employed. Considerable violence must
have been used, judging by the injuries.</p>

<p>"This is the weapon all right," said the inspector in charge.
"There's blood and hair on the end of it, and the doctor says that one
end of the spanner exactly fits the wound."</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder examined the gruesome relic and put it down without a
word.</p>

<p>He was puzzled, much more puzzled than any of the officers who were
with him. Obviously this spanner had caused the injuries from which the
unhappy master had died, but there were certain peculiar features of
the case which made him reject immediately the theories which were put
forward as to motive.</p>

<p>"It couldn't have been robbery," said the chief inspector. "He had
about ten pounds in his pocket when he was found. No, he's got on the
wrong side of somebody in the political world, and they've waited for
him. He has been threatened several times. This case might turn into a
very big political sensation. Don't you agree, Mr. Reeder?"</p>

<p>Reeder shook his head.</p>

<p>"I--um--am afraid I don't," he said gently. "A sensation, yes, but
not a political sensation. It is a peculiar case."</p>

<p>"I thought you might think that," said the inspector sarcastically.
"I've had a feeling it was something like that ever since I came into
it."</p>

<p>"It's a peculiar case," Mr. Reeder went on. "When Mr. Friston was
found, his soft felt hat was still on his head, badly cut and battered,
but still on his head. His servant, whom I took the liberty of
interviewing, said that that was an eccentricity of his master, to wear
his hat pulled tightly down almost over his ears--it was so tightly
wedged that it did not fall off when he fell."</p>

<p>"It was cut through," said the inspector.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder nodded.</p>

<p>"Certainly. Part of the hat was embedded in the wound, and, as you
say, considerable violence must have been used."</p>

<p>He looked from one to the other pathetically.</p>

<p>"I--er--hate interfering with your work, inspector, or even to
advance my own humble theories. I admit I'm puzzled."</p>

<p>"We're all that," said the inspector good-humouredly; "but isn't
that a feature of every case, Mr. Reeder; you're puzzled at first, but
after a bit of hard work the whole thing becomes as clear as daylight.
The man who did it--"</p>

<p>"That isn't puzzling me so much," said Mr. Reeder. "The question
which is rather distressing me is this--who was the other man who was
killed?"</p>

<p>The inspector stared at him.</p>

<p>"The other man? Only one body was found."</p>

<p>J. G. Reeder inclined his head.</p>

<p>"Yes, but there was another person killed by that spanner. For
example, there is blood on it and hair."</p>

<p>"Well?" said Inspector Laymen. "You'd expect to find blood and hair
after a murder like this."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said Mr. Reeder gently; "not when--um--the
actual weapon did not come into contact with the wound, and when the
unfortunate gentleman is--um--bald."</p>

<p>Laymen gaped at him, ran his fingers through his hair.</p>

<p>"That's right," he said slowly, "there was practically no blood,
and, as you say, he was bald!"</p>

<p>He unwrapped the spanner to make sure.</p>

<p>"It is all very disconcerting," Mr. Reeder went on. "Whoever killed
the respected gentleman had already destroyed somebody else with the
same weapon; or if he had not killed him, had injured him very
severely."</p>

<p>Acting on this theory, the inspector ordered an extensive search of
the neighbourhood, and the river bank for two miles was scrutinised
carefully, without, however, discovering anything that might elucidate
the second mystery.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder spent the greater part of his day pursuing solitary
inquiries; he did not rejoin the inspector and his party, but journeyed
to London by train. At Paddington he bought all the evening newspapers
and read the account of the tragedy with the greatest care, for
newspaper men have sometimes a trick of picking up an odd and important
clue which has escaped the official eye. There was nothing here,
however, that helped toward a solution, and, after boarding his tram at
Westminster Bridge, Mr. Reeder settled down to read the remainder of
the news.</p>

<p>He was a careful and systematic reader of newspapers; no item
escaped his attention. He read even the advertisements carefully, and
had been seen secretly marking the cross-word puzzles with a stub of
pencil.</p>

<p>The tram had passed the ganglion of the Elephant and Castle when he
saw a headline: "Dollars in Hayrick. Farm Labourer's Surprising
Discovery."</p>

<p>"A farm labourer named Ward, in the employ of Mr. John Carter, a
farmer, of Farnham, made a remarkable discovery this morning. He had
occasion to go to the top of a hayrick, the thatching of which had been
blown off in last week's gale. He was about to begin work when he
noticed a flat packet lying on the top of the hay. Picking it up, he
carried it to his employer, being unable to read, and Mr. Carter found
the packet to contain twenty-five thousand dollars. They were fastened
together with a rubber band, and, except that a few notes were sodden
by the rain, they were undamaged. He immediately communicated with the
Farnham police, who have taken charge of the notes and have instituted
inquiries. There have been many burglaries in the neighbourhood during
the past three months, and it is believed that this package was part of
the proceeds, since several wealthy Americans were in residence here
during the summer. Mr. Carter and his labourers made an exhaustive
search of the hayrick, but no other valuables have been found."</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder kept a mental file of all important crimes, and though it
was perfectly certain that there could have been burglaries in that
neighbourhood, he could remember nothing of importance, nor could he
recall the fact that any very important loss had been reported to the
police.</p>

<p>He turned to the stop press and found two brief references; the
first was to the hayrick discovery, and was headed:</p>

<p>DOLLARS IN HAYRICK (See page 1)</p>

<p>"A further packet containing twenty-five thousand dollars was
discovered in a dry ditch within a mile of the first discovery."</p>

<p>"Humph!" murmured Mr. Reeder, and devoted his attention to the
second item:</p>

<p>"MYSTERY OF BURNT CAR (See page 6)</p>

<p>"The car was bought by a man who gave the name of Stevenson at the
Brickfield Garage, Waterloo Road."</p>

<p>He turned back to page 6, a little annoyed with himself that he had
overlooked a news item so important that it called for further
reference in the stop press. It was not a very exciting piece of news.
A car had been found by the side of the road between Shrewton and
Tilshead in Wiltshire. It was completely burnt out, and its owner or
driver had disappeared. Neither the Shrewton nor the Tilshead police
had had any report of the occurrence.</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Mr. Reeder again.</p>

<p>Half his success as an investigator came from his ability to build
up stories from the flimsiest foundations. The truest and probably the
cleverest thing that had been said about him was that he had an
instinct for accurate association--accurate or not, he could join up
disconnected incidents to make the most incredible stories. They were
not only incredible but often fantastical, and more often than not had
no other value than to afford him the interest and amusement which only
the inventor finds in his creations.</p>

<p>All the way home J. G. Reeder made up stories, which brought in a
burnt car, two packets of American bank-notes and an eminent master of
Eton College struck down in the middle of the night by an unknown
assailant.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder never pursued these dream stories of his, unless there
came to him that queer sense of conviction which belongs rather to
instinct than to reason. They served to fill an idle hour, to serve as
mental gymnastics to amuse him.</p>

<p>He had reached Brockley and was munching his evening muffins when he
began his second story, and he was half-way through the preliminaries
when he had that eerie sense that he was telling himself something
which was true. He put down an unfinished muffin on the plate, gulped
the remainder of his tea, and, wiping his buttery fingers on a
serviette, rang the bell. The housekeeper came.</p>

<p>"Clear all this away," said Mr. Reeder. "I'm going to work."</p>

<p>His idea of work was peculiar; for two hours he sat at his desk, his
hands clasped on his waistcoat, staring fixedly at his blotting-pad.
Only at long intervals did he pick up the pencil and scribble a note on
a sheet of paper or strike out some memorandum that he had previously
written down.</p>

<p>At half-past ten he went to his room and changed into evening dress.
It was an unusual outburst of gaiety on the part of Mr. Reeder. His
housekeeper was almost shocked.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>IT was a quarter to twelve when Mr. Reeder strolled into the Ragbag
Club, which is situated in Wardour Street and is only heard of by the
general public when it is periodically raided. In spite of the fact
that he was a very rare visitor, he was recognised, and the head waiter
found a corner table for him, and produced his inevitable bottle of
Vichy and the as inevitable fried egg and bacon.</p>

<p>"Nobody here, Adolph?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, Mr. Reeder. They start coming in after the theatre."</p>

<p>The head waiter was a little nervous.</p>

<p>"Anything doing, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder took a yellow carton of cigarettes from his trousers
pocket, and lit one carefully before he replied.</p>

<p>"If you mean by that, Adolph, are the police raiding this speakeasy,
I am unable to afford you any information. I should imagine, however,
that you will be safe for to-night."</p>

<p>The head waiter looked his relief. Such a speculation on the part of
his visitor was tantamount to a guarantee, and, indeed, Mr. Reeder had,
before his arrival, notified Scotland Yard where he was spending the
evening.</p>

<p>"Are you expecting anybody?"</p>

<p>The head waiter shook his head.</p>

<p>"Nobody you know, Mr. Reeder."</p>

<p>This was a mechanical assurance; Reeder had had it before.</p>

<p>He picked daintily at his bacon.</p>

<p>"Mr. Higson, now?" he suggested. "Mr. Hymie Higson?"</p>

<p>The head waiter looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"He hasn't been here since--"</p>

<p>"Let's have the truth," said Mr. Reeder softly. "If I deal fairly
with a man I expect him to deal fairly with me. About a year ago"--he
was devoting himself entirely to his supper, and apparently the story
he now related was something to make conversation--"about a year ago
there was considerable trouble, I believe, with a man whose name I
forget for the moment, but whose offence was the passing of forged
money. The money was traced here, to this delightful club, and to its
very nice, polite head waiter, who is also the proprietor. I
investigated the matter on behalf of the--um--authorities, and I
discovered that you were perfectly innocent in the matter. I could, of
course, have made matters very unpleasant for you, but, being a
perfectly honest man and having no desire to inconvenience the general
public, I--um--did not bring you into court as witness."</p>

<p>The head waiter cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"That's true, Mr. Reeder. I told you then that if I could ever do
anything for you--"</p>

<p>"Well?" Mr. Reeder looked up, and this time the head waiter was not
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Hymie hasn't been here since last Sunday night," he said; "but I'm
expecting him to-night. In fact, he telephoned to me and asked me to
have a hot supper ready for him in the private room. But the private
room has been booked, so he's got to take it in the restaurant. I'm
expecting him every minute now."</p>

<p>"When did he telephone?"</p>

<p>The waiter thought.</p>

<p>"This evening. He said he was very anxious to have the private
room."</p>

<p>"Is he bringing somebody?"</p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, sir, he said nothing about that. He's only ordered supper for
one."</p>

<p>"I'll wait," said Mr. Reeder.</p>

<p>The head waiter looked at him, troubled.</p>

<p>"There's nothing wrong, is there? I mean, if you have to make any
kind of pinch, I wish you'd do it outside the club, Mr. Reeder. We've
got such a bad name lately with the police--"</p>

<p>"I'm not going to pinch anybody," said J. G. cheerfully. "I merely
want to renew an old and unpleasant acquaintance."</p>

<p>His opportunity came five minutes later, when Hymie Higson came in.
He was wearing a long overcoat, which he slipped off and handed to the
waiter at the door. Evidently the occasion was not a festive one, for
he was not dressed for any party. He glanced round the room and then
his eyes fell upon Mr. Reeder. He was all for pretending that he had
not seen his <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i>, and was turning away when Mr.
Reeder beckoned him.</p>

<p>The room was still sparsely tenanted, and there was no excuse
whatever for the newly arrived visitor to make a hurried exit, and
reluctantly he came across to where the detective was sitting.</p>

<p>"All alone?" asked Mr. Reeder pleasantly. "Sit down."</p>

<p>"I'm expecting some friends." Hymie was very cool and watchful. He
stood at the table, ignoring the invitation.</p>

<p>"I think you'd better sit down," said Mr. Reeder amiably.</p>

<p>With great reluctance Hymie sat. He was a wiry man, with a keen,
dark face and abnormally long, thin hands.</p>

<p>"Well, get it over." His tone was offensive. "It doesn't do me any
good being seen speaking to a copper."</p>

<p>"It doesn't do me any good or any harm," rejoined Mr. Reeder.
"Anybody who knows you and me will imagine that I am questioning a
second-class crook, and an amateur at that. A buyer and passer of snide
notes, a forger of acceptances, a card-sharper who robbed his young
brother officers and was expelled from the service which he never
adorned, a born confidence man, possibly a murderer, certainly a wholly
undesirable citizen."</p>

<p>He said this with the greatest blandness, and with every accusation
Hymie's eyes grew harder.</p>

<p>"You'll be able to write the story of my life," he said.</p>

<p>"I shall be able to contribute many interesting items," said Mr.
Reeder suavely. And then, without a pause: "You had very bad luck with
the money."</p>

<p>Master as he was of his emotions, Hymie blinked quickly twice.</p>

<p>"I don't get that."</p>

<p>"Fifty thousand dollars." Mr. Reeder did not look up. "Ten thousand
pounds. An awful lot of money to leave behind you in ditches and
hayricks."</p>

<p>"Ditches and hayricks?" Hymie spoke slowly. "Is this a new joke or a
new puzzle or what? I don't understand you." And then he chuckled.
"Good Lord! You mean the stuff in the evening papers about the fellow
in Kent who found some American money on the top of a haystack? That's
funny--one of the funniest things I've heard. Why should I know
anything about it?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't in Kent," said Mr. Reeder carefully; "it was a place
called Farnham."</p>

<p>"I've never been there in my life," smiled Hymie, "and that you can
take as gospel truth, Reeder. I've never been there in my life. If I
had been there I should hardly have been chucking bundles of thousand
dollar-bills into hayricks. And if that's all you've got to talk to me
about, you're wasting your own time and mine."</p>

<p>He rose abruptly, but Reeder's hand caught his arm.</p>

<p>"Sit down," he said. "There are one or two other questions I want to
ask you."</p>

<p>"Ask 'em by letter, or better still go read an article I read the
other day about the truth machine. You strap it on a man and when he
lies you get a reaction. They tried it on a bird who'd murdered--"</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly. Reeder saw his face go suddenly hard and
pinched.</p>

<p>"Who'd murdered?" he suggested.</p>

<p>Hymie laughed.</p>

<p>"I haven't come here to tell you granny stories," he said.</p>

<p>Hymie shook off the detaining hand and stalked away. He would have
gone with less comfort if he had known that J. G. Reeder had also read
that article on the truth machine which had appeared in an American
magazine.</p>

<p>Hymie's meal was a frugal one, Mr. Reeder noticed. He was not in the
restaurant long before he paid his bill and departed.</p>

<p>J. G. Reeder had a number of other inquiries to make, but none of
these proved very satisfactory. He visited clubs less reputable than
the Ragbag, dingy places where his evening dress excited guffaws of
amusement; little upstairs rooms, clouded with smoke, where he was
recognised and a deadly silence fell on his appearance. He buttonholed
the most unlikely people and plied them with mysterious questions. He
was a tired man when he got back to Brockley. The clock was striking
three as he slipped into bed and pulled the coverlet over his shoulder,
but he could not have closed his eyes before he heard the bell of the
front door ringing. It rang incessantly, and, rising, he opened the
window still further and looked out.</p>

<p>He saw an indistinct figure standing on the step. "Who's that?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"It's Lizzie, sir. Can I see you? An awful thing has happened!"</p>

<p>"Wait a moment."</p>

<p>He closed the window, switched on his light, and, dressing hastily,
went downstairs and admitted the sobbing parlourmaid. It was a long
time before she became coherent, though he learned the object of her
visit before she could relate the circumstances.</p>

<p>"Ena's gone...been took away...Oh, I'm sure something's happened to
her, Mr. Reeder..."</p>

<p>He gave her some water, and after a while she became calmer and told
her story. She had gone to bed at eleven o'clock. She and her sister
slept in the front room, looking on to the street. They had talked for
an hour on the inevitable subject of Ernie and his peculiar behaviour,
and they must have fallen asleep somewhere about midnight.</p>

<p>At one o'clock Lizzie, who was a heavy sleeper, was awakened by
voices. Stupid with sleep as she was, she sat up in bed and found Ena
in her dressing-gown going out through the door. She had asked what was
the trouble, and Ena had whispered: "It's Ernie. He's outside. He wants
to see me for a minute."</p>

<p>Still half-asleep, Lizzie lay and waited. She heard no sound of
voices, and presently she became wide awake. She heard the noise of a
car driving off, and, getting out of bed, went to the door and
listened. There was no sound. The narrow hall below was in darkness,
and, lighting a candle, she went down the stairs in search of her
sister. The front door was wide open, but her sister was nowhere
visible.</p>

<p>Lizzie ran into the street and looked up and down. The thoroughfare
was deserted. In the passage she found one of Ena's slippers, and, in
alarm, she went upstairs and woke her mother. Ena had vanished. She had
gone to the interview in a dressing-gown over her night-dress, had not
even put on her stockings. The night was chilly, with a slight fog, not
the kind of night that Ena would choose for a stroll, even if she were
fully dressed.</p>

<p>"Have you notified the police?" asked Mr. Reeder quickly.</p>

<p>The woebegone Lizzie shook her head.</p>

<p>"Mother didn't want the disgrace of bringing in the police--" she
began.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder forced the disgrace upon this family by reaching for the
telephone and calling the nearest police station. He had the good
fortune to find the divisional inspector, and arranged to meet him at
the house in Friendly Street.</p>

<p>As they walked together down Tanner's Hill Lizzie told him of her
last talk with her sister.</p>

<p>"No, she said nothing unusual, but, naturally, the American money
coming was a great surprise to us all."</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder stopped in his stride.</p>

<p>"The American money?" he said quickly. "What American money was
this?"</p>

<p>"Dollars," said the girl; "foreign money--American--twenty-five
notes for a thousand dollars, and a thousand dollars is worth more than
two hundred pounds...Ena was surprised, and so was I. We had never seen
so much money in our lives. Five thousand pounds, Mr. Reeder."</p>

<p>"Tell me about this," he said as they walked on slowly.</p>

<p>"It came by express post, not registered or anything, yesterday
morning by the first post. Ena didn't tell mother anything about it,
because Ernie said, 'Don't mention this to a soul.' She only told me
because it got on her mind."</p>

<p>"He wrote a letter with it, did he?"</p>

<p>"Not a letter, just a scrap of paper fastened inside the band that
went round the bank-notes. Just that--'Don't tell a soul about this,
not even Lizzie.' Those were the very words. I'll show them to
you."</p>

<p>"What did she do with the money?"'</p>

<p>The girl considered this.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Oh, yes, I do," she said suddenly. "She put it under
her pillow just before she went to sleep. I'd forgotten all about
it."</p>

<p>"Where was it posted?"</p>

<p>"In London," said Lizzie. "I specially noticed this--London, W.1. It
was posted the night before. Ena said, 'It's funny, Ernie being in
London and not coming to see me'--that's what we were talking about
last night."</p>

<p>She was certain that there was nothing more than this admonition,
written on a scrap of paper fastened to the notes by a rubber band.</p>

<p>"But you'll see for yourself," she said, "and the envelope. Ena kept
the money in the envelope. She's a very careful girl, is Ena--poor
darling!"</p>

<p>She began to weep softly, and Mr. Reeder was uncomfortable.</p>

<p>When they reached the house they found that the divisional inspector
and one of his men had already arrived, and were interviewing the
tearful mother. Reeder went straight upstairs to the bedroom, and his
first act was to turn back the pillow, still bearing the impression of
Ena's pretty head. There was nothing beneath the pillow, neither letter
nor notes. He pulled over the mattress, but the money was not there;
nor was it in the locked drawer where she kept her treasures.</p>

<p>"She didn't put it in the drawer," insisted Lizzie. "I actually saw
her put it under the pillow just before she went to bed. She had a
little joke about having money to fall back upon."</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder pursed his lips.</p>

<p>"Did you see her when she was leaving the room? Did she have
anything in her hand?"</p>

<p>Lizzie was uncertain. The room was dark, the blind drawn. The only
thing she was sure about was that Ena was in the doorway and had spoken
to her. She was so sleepy that she could not even remember the girl's
exact words.</p>

<p>"I'm such a heavy sleeper," she confessed, "that Ena might have been
having a long talk through the window. It was open; in fact, it was the
cold air that woke me up."</p>

<p>One thing was clear to Reeder: whoever had called, and whatever was
the whispered conversation they had held between window and pavement,
the caller had asked her to bring with her the American bank-notes.</p>

<p>For whom would she go down in the middle of the night? He questioned
Lizzie on this, but her memory was vague. It could not have been
anybody who bore the slightest resemblance to the man with the false
moustache, but, against this, Ena had not seen him.</p>

<p>The constable on the beat was found, and he was able to give a few
vital details. He had seen a car drawn up at the end of the street, and
had thought it belonged to a doctor. The only machines of importance
that came into Friendly Street in the night were usually associated
with births or deaths. He had spoken to the chauffeur, but, having no
curiosity as to the ownership of the car, had asked him no questions.
He had had the impression that there was somebody sitting inside the
car, but he wasn't very sure about this, and when he had returned on
his second visit, which was a quarter of an hour after Ena had
disappeared, the "doctor's" car had gone.</p>

<p>A rough examination of the street by flashlight produced another
clue-- the second of Ena's slippers. It lay in the gutter, and had been
run over, evidently by the car, for on the silken uppers was the mark
of a diamond tyre tread. The slipper was found at a point midway
between where the car had been seen waiting and the girl's home. The
divisional inspector brought it into the house and examined it
carefully, but it afforded them no assistance, the only suggestion it
offered being that the slipper was kicked off between the house and the
car by Ena in the course of a struggle.</p>

<p>The divisional inspector had a ready-made solution to the mystery,
which was more flattering to Ena's enterprise than to her modesty, but
this Reeder rejected.</p>

<p>"She didn't go willingly--of that I'm certain," he said, and here he
was right.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p>ENA PANTON did not fall asleep immediately her head touched the
pillow. Her mind was excited. She was baffled by the amazing conduct of
a young man towards whom she had pleasant feelings, though she could
not, in the strictest sense of the term, regard herself as being in
love with him.</p>

<p>Ernie was one of those indistinct and eager courtiers who impress
not so much by their personality as by their sincerity. He had been in
love, very much in love, and after the manner of her sex the girl had
played on his emotions without finding them communicated to herself.
She liked him; she was flattered by him. When he became munificent she
was a little impressed by him. But she had never loved this chinless
young man, with his sleek hair and his tiny moustache. Now he was a
factor in life that gave her tremendous importance. Under her head
reposed a fortune. She put her hand beneath the pillow and touched the
envelope to make sure she was not dreaming.</p>

<p>She heard the clock strike hour by hour, and she was wide awake when
the first pebble struck the window pane. She got out of bed, pulled up
the blind gently so that she should not disturb her sister, and looked
out. She saw a motor car standing by the kerb a little way along the
street, and beneath the window a man muffled to the chin by the collar
of his overcoat. Foreshortened as he was, and in the darkness--the
house stood midway between two street lamps--she could not distinguish
him. But it might be Ernie. She raised the window carefully and looked
out.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Ena?" said a voice.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" she asked in the same tone. "Jack--Ernie's
brother."</p>

<p>She had never known till then that Ernie had a brother.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Ernie wants to see you; he's in the car. Can you come down for a
second?"</p>

<p>She hesitated, looked towards her sister, who, if the truth be told,
was snoring.</p>

<p>"I don't know if I can," she said. "Can't you tell me?"</p>

<p>"It's about the money," whispered the voice urgently. "Bring it down
with you and I'll explain. The police are after Ernie, and they may be
after you."</p>

<p>This was a terrific shock to the respectable Ena, and threw her off
her balance. A greater shock, since she had had some doubt as to
whether any person in the world could possess so vast a sum as five
thousand pounds without having acquired it dishonestly.</p>

<p>"I'll be down," she said, put on her slippers and her dressing-gown
and, taking the money from under her pillow, opened the door.</p>

<p>It was at this point that Lizzie woke.</p>

<p>"It's all right. It's a man who wants to see me about Ernie,"
whispered the girl, and went pattering down the stairs.</p>

<p>She took off the chain, unlocked the door and opened it.</p>

<p>"I can't ask you in--" she began.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he took a step into the passage and before she
realised what had happened, a strong arm closed round her, a hand
covered her mouth and nose.</p>

<p>"If you make a noise I'll kill you!" breathed an unpleasant voice in
her ear.</p>

<p>Momentarily she was paralysed with fear, allowed herself to be led
out into the cold street, and was only conscious that she had lost a
slipper when her bare foot touched the pavement. This brought her back
to sanity. The hands were still over her mouth, and with a jerk she
tried to free herself. For a moment there was a breathless struggle,
until he lifted her bodily and ran with her to the car. The chauffeur
had opened the door, and the man got in, dragging her after him and
flung her on the seat by his side.</p>

<p>"If you make a fuss I'll kill you," he said again. "I mean that. I
could break that little neck of yours as easy as breaking a stick."</p>

<p>She subsided into the corner, sick and trembling, and, stooping, he
picked up a rug and flung it over her, pulled down the blinds and
settled himself by her side.</p>

<p>She could not see where the car was going. She felt it breast a
hill, and guessed they were going into Lewisham. She began to cry and
wail, and this her captor tolerated. Then suddenly she remembered.</p>

<p>"What have you done with the money, you thief? You're not Ernie's
brother Jack...He has no brother."</p>

<p>The man laughed.</p>

<p>"What do you know about Ernie or his brothers or sisters or aunts or
cousins?" he asked flippantly. "But you're quite right about the money;
I've got it, in my pocket. I've lost too much through that damned
fool's stupidity."</p>

<p>"Where is Ernie?" she asked.</p>

<p>He made no reply to this.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with me?" she demanded after a long
silence.</p>

<p>"It's not what I'm going to do, it's what you're going to do," he
said. "You're going to write a letter to your mother or sister or your
friend Mr. Reeder, and tell them that you've gone abroad with Ernie,
and that you're perfectly happy, and that you'll be coming back in a
year--and--"</p>

<p>"I'm not going abroad with you or Ernie," she stormed. "You'll be
locked up for this--taking me out of the house--"</p>

<p>"You must be very pretty," said her captor cynically. "I haven't had
a good look at you, but you must be very pretty. You're so damned
unintelligent that there must be some points about you that would
attract even a nit-wit like that copper-hearted bird."</p>

<p>The mention of Mr. Reeder gave her an idea.</p>

<p>"Mr. Reeder will find me," she said. "You'll not get away with it.
He knows everything about Ernie. I showed him the letters that Ernie
sent--"</p>

<p>"What letters?" asked the man quickly, and she realised she had made
a mistake.</p>

<p>"One letter, anyway. The letter he sent from Birmingham."</p>

<p>She heard him gasp.</p>

<p>"Did he write to you from Birmingham? Was--was there any address on
the letter?"</p>

<p>She hesitated, and she heard his sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"There wasn't," he said. "Reeder's got the letter, has he?"</p>

<p>She did not reply, and leaning over, he caught her by the shoulders
and shook her roughly.</p>

<p>"When I speak to you, answer," he said. "Now, tell me all that
Reeder knows."</p>

<p>She began to cry softly.</p>

<p>"If you snivel I shall be sorry for you, and if I'm sorry for you I
shall kiss you," he said, and she sat bolt upright, stiff with
fear.</p>

<p>There was nothing subtle about Ena. She had not even a native
cunning.</p>

<p>"Lizzie took the letters to him, and he asked her a lot of questions
as to how Ernie wrote, whether he made--you know--little circles in the
air before he started to put his pen on the paper."</p>

<p>She heard the man whistle.</p>

<p>"He asked that, did he--the old devil!"</p>

<p>She realised she had to propitiate him, and it was not difficult for
Ena to propitiate men, even men met under the present distressing
circumstances.</p>

<p>"It was awful of you to take me away like this," she said. "You'll
get into ever such trouble---"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that," he said curtly. "Go on telling me what
Reeder said."</p>

<p>There was very little she could tell him, he realised after she had
been talking for a little while.</p>

<p>"Does he know about the money--the money that was sent to you this
morning--yesterday morning?" he corrected himself.</p>

<p>"No, but Lizzie will tell him."</p>

<p>"Was she awake when you left?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes, she was--and I'll bet she took the number of this car, so the
best thing you can do is to say it's a joke and take me back."</p>

<p>"That is not my idea of a joke," he said.</p>

<p>They did not speak again for the greater part of an hour. The car
was flying through the country. Twice it passed over a long bridge. She
asked where they were going. It was the third time she had put that
question.</p>

<p>"You're going to a nice, quiet, country spot," said the man. "You'll
have a little suite of your own, and if you've any brains you will sit
down and amuse yourself with knitting. I'll get you some clothes
to-morrow and if you don't make any attempt to escape you'll be treated
decently. If you do try to get away--" He did not finish the
sentence.</p>

<p>She fell asleep in the last half-hour of the journey, and was
awakened when the car stopped. He took a large silk handkerchief and
bound her eyes before he assisted her into a house which smelt close
and musty, and guided her feet up the stairs which were so broad that,
reaching out her hand, she could feel no balustrade.</p>

<p>He kept her waiting for about a quarter of an hour in a small,
unfurnished room, and here she sat shivering on a chair, with a rug
round her shoulders, until he came for her, and showed her into a
bigger room that had evidently been hastily furnished with a bed. The
windows were covered with wooden shutters. The room had been newly
papered, and had the luxury of a small bathroom which led from the
apartment, a bathroom which was apparently entirely without
windows.</p>

<p>"I'll get you some food, and to-morrow I'll bring you books and
anything you need."</p>

<p>He stood revealed now in the light he had switched on; a tall man,
lithe, keen, good-looking. It was the first time Hymie Higson had seen
the girl, and he could admire and approve Ernie's choice.</p>

<p>"You're a good-looker but dumb," he said good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"I can talk if I want--" she began.</p>

<p>"I don't mean that kind of dumbness." He tapped his head. "Maybe
we'll improve your mind down here; and in the meantime I'll give you my
word for what it is worth, that you won't be molested unless you
attempt to escape. There's a man on guard below your window; there will
always be somebody up in the house, and your chance of getting away is
practically nil. What is more important, you'll be very sorry if you
attempt to make your escape. I'm telling you."</p>

<p>He went away and came back with some hot tea and sandwiches, which
he put on a table.</p>

<p>"You're a sensible girl, and you don't need me to tell you that if
I'd go to the trouble of abducting you, which carries a sentence of ten
years penal servitude, there's very little I'd stop short at. When I
told you I'd break that little neck of yours I meant it. It would be
harder to do now I've had a good look at you--but I'd do it! Will you
please regard me as a sleeping dog and let me lie! And don't kick
me!"</p>

<p>There was a certain refinement in his tone. She thought it was
rather "aristocratic," and then in a flash remembered the man who had
come in the false moustache, and promptly charged him with that visit.
He nodded.</p>

<p>"That's true. I was trying to do you a turn. You didn't know it, but
I was. If your sister hadn't gone to that"--he checked himself--"that
man Reeder, if she hadn't spilt the beans to him, you wouldn't be in
this mess. I wouldn't have minded the money the treacherous little dog
sent you--after all, you're probably entitled to your cut."</p>

<p>Since she did not realise the significance of this innuendo it
passed unchallenged.</p>

<p>He left her, and after some hesitation she drank the tea and
finished the sandwiches, in some trepidation.</p>

<p>It was not until the first streaks of dawn showed through the cracks
in the shutters that weariness overcame her, and, lying down on the
bed, she pulled a rug over her and went to sleep. She must have slept
throughout the day, for it was dusk when she woke up and, switching on
the light, pushed the bell which Hymie had shown her.</p>

<p>It was some time before an answer came, in the shape of Hymie
himself, carrying a tray.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to keep you waiting," he said with mock humility; "but as
I'm head cook and warder of this establishment, and I've no lady's maid
to wait upon you, you'll have to be satisfied with the best I can give
you."</p>

<p>The best was boiled eggs and new bread, and delicious butter. Being
young and healthy, and with a young and healthy person's appetite, she
was more concerned in the satisfaction of her hunger than in her
immediate danger.</p>

<p>He went out of the room and came back with a bundle of clothes,
which he threw on the bed.</p>

<p>"They're all new, and they've all been collected with considerable
trouble from a dozen London stores. I guess old man Reeder has been
circulating warnings to outfitters. If they had all been purchased at
the same place, some copper-hearted chicken would have blown the
works."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'copper-hearted'?" she asked curiously, and he
was pleased to explain that a copper-hearted was one who had an
affection for policemen and was predisposed to supply information to
these indispensable servants of civilisation.</p>

<p>"That's all there is to it, baby."</p>

<p>"Are you American?" she asked, and he smiled, showing his white
teeth.</p>

<p>"English by birth, American by education. I had the honour of
spending my eighteenth birthday in an American college called
Sing-Sing--you may have heard of the establishment."</p>

<p>"It's a prison, isn't it?" she said, and he chuckled.</p>

<p>"This growth of education on the part of the lower orders can be
traced to the movies. Yes, my child, the college was Sing-Sing, and the
actual form I was in was located in the death house, from which a
well-directed 'life-boat'" (Footnote: i.e., Pardon.) "rescued me in
time to serve with distinction in the Great War."</p>

<p>He waved his hand to the clothing.</p>

<p>"There's everything there that a lady requires," he said. "Not that
you're a lady, but no doubt you dress like one. If I have omitted
something, I hope you'll be immodest enough to tell me."</p>

<p>He went away after this and she bolted the door on him and dressed.
Beyond the fact that the shoes were a size too large, the clothing
fitted her, and she felt more at her ease. It was when he came back
that he discovered that the door had a bolt.</p>

<p>"I overlooked that," he said when he was admitted.</p>

<p>He went to the door and called a name. Presently a man came in, who,
without so much as looking at her, proceeded to remove the bolt.</p>

<p>"It isn't necessary if you play square," said Hymie, "and if you
didn't play square that bolt would be no more use to you than
post-cards in hell!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>MR. REEDER'S views on the deplorable state of his mind were familiar
to most people, but he was never quite so much a criminal as he was in
the twelve hours which followed the disappearance of Ena Panton.</p>

<p>He had suspicions amounting almost to certainty. But Scotland Yard
is a very cautious machine, not easily set in motion. "Maybe's" and
"Very likely's" do not send the wheels grinding. More important, it is
very careful to hide from those on whom suspicion falls that they are
suspect, and this care often arrests too close inquiries. But Mr.
Reeder was not at Scotland Yard. He was an extraneous force that moved
sometimes independently of, and sometimes in conjunction with, that
establishment, but he was not entirely bound by the methods and formula
of Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>He interviewed the Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions, and
this gentleman said all that Mr. Reeder expected him to say, which was
that he should pass any exact information he had to the Criminal
Investigation Department.</p>

<p>Between conjecture and exact information yawns a deep, wide gulf.
Mr. Reeder might suppose all manner of things, but the only fact he had
to go on was that a little typist, living in the poorest part of
London, had left her house, scantily attired, in the middle of the
night and had disappeared. There was not even definite information upon
which the police could act that she was in possession of five thousand
pounds in dollar currency. They had only the evidence of her sister,
who admittedly knew little or nothing about foreign currency, and, in
addition, there was a peculiar want of title to the money, supposing it
had been under the girl's pillow as Lizzie had stated.</p>

<p>All that he could say in his minute to the C.I.D. was that the girl
had disappeared, and all that Scotland Yard could reply politely, yet
with a hint of flippancy, was that young ladies had heretofore walked
out of their houses in the middle of the night, and even in the middle
of the day, and flown to mysterious love nests which were of a quite
innocuous character.</p>

<p>Inspector Grayson, who came over to consult with Mr. Reeder, put the
matter from his point of view.</p>

<p>"There may be something very big behind it. On the other hand, you
know how these people romance. For all you can tell the girl may have
been fully dressed and waiting for the arrival of this young man. The
fact that her old clothes were found in the room may mean nothing more
than that she had something better to wear. This is disappearance six
hundred and seventy-three, and against that you've got to balance four
or five hundred that have turned up, very sorry for themselves, and
hoping that everything will be forgotten and forgiven. The money part
of it is a bit of a puzzle, but I think I've found the explanation of
that."</p>

<p>He took out his pocket-book and produced some newspaper cuttings.
They dealt with the finding of the two packets of bank-notes near
Farnham.</p>

<p>"That is what started this yarn. She has read this in the paper and
has probably invented the rest. You know what liars these people
are--they'll do anything to get themselves into the limelight."</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder sighed. He always sighed when anybody else took a low
view of human nature.</p>

<p>It had been a bluff on his part to connect Hymie Higson with the
discovery of the money on the hayrick, part of one of his fantastical
stories, which had once seemed real and now had gone back to its old
perspective. He rather wished he could see Higson again, because there
was something about the man...</p>

<p>Was it Higson? Was Higson the abductor? He asked why he should be,
and found no satisfactory answer.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder sat down at his desk and fell to storytelling all over
again, imagining the worst of everybody, imputing motives far from
commendable to every man and woman associated in his mind with the
case.</p>

<p>Ena might turn up again and make them all look foolish. He had only
the evidence of a sleepy girl, not too intelligent, possibly not too
truthful; a young lady whose passion for sensationalism had been
stimulated by her devotion to the pictures.</p>

<p>On one point, however, he was certain; when the blow fell, as he
knew it must inevitably fall, he was prepared for an event which
shocked ten millionaire directors to their core, if indeed they
possessed such a moral stiffening.</p>

<p>He was sent for the next day as soon as he reached the office. The
Assistant Director was very perturbed.</p>

<p>"I want you to go down to the City and see Sir Wilfred Heinhall.
It's very important, Reeder, so please don't go by bus--take a
taxi."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Mr. Reeder. "I will go the quickest way."</p>

<p>Actually he went by tube.</p>

<p>They were waiting for him in the stately anteroom to Sir Wilfred's
palatial boardroom; two managers and a managing clerk escorted him into
the gilded room with its crystal chandeliers and priceless
paintings.</p>

<p>"Mr. Reeder, Sir Wilfred," they announced in hushed voices, and left
him.</p>

<p>Sir Wilfred was pacing up and down a large and expensive Persian
rug. His hands were thrust into his pockets, his whitish, sandy hair
was disarrayed in a picturesque and alarming manner. He looked like a
man who had not slept for a month.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mr. Reeder," he said in a hollow voice. "Sit down! A most
dreadful thing has happened, and I cannot help but recall your fateful
words--yes, I think I could describe them as 'fateful'--the last time
we met. I refer to our business system, with which I was all too
satisfied-- all too satisfied!"</p>

<p>He made a gesture of despair. Mr. Reeder sat down on the edge of the
chair, his umbrella between his legs, his hands grasping the knob, and
waited.</p>

<p>"When you told me, Mr. Reeder, that the system on which the Central
and Southern Bank is run was archaic and out of date, I admit I
scoffed. I have a distinct recollection of scoffing. I may have been
rude to you."</p>

<p>"You were," murmured Mr. Reeder.</p>

<p>"I am sorry! I can say nothing more than that--I am sorry. A
terrible thing has happened--the most terrible thing in the history of
the bank. Mr. Reeder, we have been robbed of a fortune. Not here in
London, Mr. Reeder, but--" He paused dramatically.</p>

<p>"In Birmingham?" said Mr. Reeder, and Sir Wilfred opened his mouth
wide.</p>

<p>"In Birmingham? I have not told a soul where it was. I did not even
tell the Public Prosecutor. I have not mentioned it even to my managing
director--it was Birmingham, yes."</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"By a clerk. I don't know what his surname was, but I imagine his
Christian name was Ernest." Sir Wilfred sat down heavily.</p>

<p>"You knew?" He almost squeaked the words. "You knew that we were
being robbed? His name is Ernest Graddle--an awful name, one which of
itself should have sown suspicion in the mind of any careful manager.
Ernest Graddle! A clerk earning a few pounds a week, who has been
robbing the bank systematically for the past twelve months, beginning,
it seems, with small sums, and gradually increasing until his last act
was to convert a sum of eighty-five thousand pounds to his own use!
Eighty-five thousand pounds!"</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder was not impressed.</p>

<p>"I thought it would be a pretty big sum. What is the total?"</p>

<p>"Three hundred and ten thousand pounds," said Sir Wilfred huskily.
"An enormous sum. And we have been robbed by the simplest of tricks.
One of our customers, a retired steelmaster, is something of an
eccentric. He is also unfortunately something of a recluse. Instead of
his money being invested he maintains a large current account; his
balances sometimes are as much as half a million. Although banks are
not supposed to pay interest on current accounts, we do allow him a
small percentage--three per cent. It is on this account mainly that the
money has been drawn. Our client, as I say, lives a retired life. He is
extremely religious. I almost said that he was a religious maniac. He
may not be a religious maniac, he may be just simply a maniac. No man
would keep such an enormous sum on a current account. The bank manager
has expostulated with him, but has received no reply to his
expostulations. We have, I might say, taken every precaution, and yet
this"--he tried to describe the absent Ernest, but failed--"this
wretched fellow, scarcely more than a boy, has managed to take the
money under the very eyes of our inspectors, under the eyes of our
managers, under the eyes of the district manager! It is the most
appalling thing that has happened in the history of banking."</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder knew better. More appalling things had happened in the
history of banking, but he made a certain number of allowances for Sir
Wilfred's natural indignation.</p>

<p>"I presume it will not affect the credit of the bank?" he asked, and
Sir Wilfred swelled indignantly.</p>

<p>"Affect the credit of the bank, my dear sir? Stuff and nonsense!" He
was quite his old self. "We have ten millions of reserve. The sum
involved is, so to speak, a fleabite--in a sense. In another sense it
is a colossal loss."</p>

<p>He would have enlarged upon the stability and security of the bank,
but Mr. Reeder turned the conversation to a more practical
direction.</p>

<p>"When was all this found out?" he asked.</p>

<p>It had been discovered two days before, explained Sir Wilfred. The
clerk in question, Ernest Graddle, had not turned up to work. The
manager, thinking he was ill, sent a message to where he was lodging,
and then heard for the first time that Mr. Graddle, though he
maintained the address, was very seldom in the habit of sleeping at
home. He had left for London the previous night, taking with him all
the possessions he kept at his lodgings. He had paid his landlord and
had gone away about eight o'clock in a small, black motor car which he
himself drove. The manager became suspicious, sent for an
inspector.</p>

<p>"We had the auditors in, and of course, the moment these incompetent
jackasses got down to the situation, they discovered what had happened.
Graddle handled the account from which the money was stolen, and two or
three hours' work on the books showed us just what had happened.
Naturally, I have notified the police, who are now searching for him,
and I have sent for you, Mr. Reeder, to take complete control of the
case on behalf of the bank."</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder smiled.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you can't do that," he said quietly. "I shall probably
take a limited control of the case on behalf of the Public
Prosecutor."</p>

<p>He could excuse Sir Wilfred's error, for he had spent many years of
his life in the service of the Bankers Trust, and in the course of that
association had saved them so many millions that when he retired from
his position he was presented with a piece of plate which must have
cost nearly twenty pounds.</p>

<p>He explained just where he could help, and Sir Wilfred for once took
an intelligent view of the situation.</p>

<p>The manager, accountant and bookkeeper of the Birmingham branch were
within call, and these J. G. Reeder took into the sub-manager's office,
one by one, and questioned. The manager was quaking. The hour of an
honourable retirement was near at hand. It looked to him as though the
whole of his career with the bank must go for nothing, for Sir Wilfred
had hinted to him that the handsome gratuity which the Central and
Southern Bank paid to their managers on retirement might be
withheld.</p>

<p>"I know nothing whatever about it. I am responsible, of course, for
the account, but Graddle was immensely capable, and I don't know
anybody I would have trusted sooner than him. The truth is, Mr. Reeder,
our system is wrong. I've pointed this out to Sir Wilfred a dozen
times. By the present method it is quite easy for a young clerk,
especially if he has a confederate, to wipe out the entire branch
balance!"</p>

<p>"Had Graddle any vices?"</p>

<p>The manager thought not. He was a quiet young man, a member of a
debating society, and there was no breath of scandal against his
name.</p>

<p>"Did he bet?"</p>

<p>Here the manager was emphatic. Graddle abominated gambling, and at
local societies had twice given lectures on the evil effects of
sweepstakes. There was no woman in the case; Graddle did not drink, nor
had he any other objectionable habits.</p>

<p>"He was very ambitious, and often told me that if he were a very
rich man he would play on the Stock Exchange as a man plays on a piano.
He said that fortunes could easily be acquired, and it was only the
lack of capital which kept any man poor."</p>

<p>"That is probably true," said Mr. Reeder gravely, and the manager
hastened to explain.</p>

<p>Graddle was keenly interested in the oil market, though there was no
evidence to prove that he had ever speculated a shilling on that or any
other mart. His interest, however, was such that he had attended
technical evening classes on oil engineering, was something of an
authority on oil lands, or, if he was not, pretended to be.</p>

<p>It was his practice to spend his week-ends in London, and most of
his spare cash went in this luxury. In his desk at the bank they had
discovered a number of letters from people who had advertised interests
in oil properties. Apparently he never passed an offer of oil lands
without writing to the advertisers to discover the strength of it,
though again there was no evidence that he had invested money.</p>

<p>Armed with this information, Mr. Reeder made the rounds of the City,
and after a while he came to the London offices of an American bank,
and discovered where the last eighty-five thousand pounds had been
exchanged for American currency. Some four hundred and twenty odd
thousand dollars had been paid to a young man, who had brought a
covering letter from the Central and Southern Bank, and who had paid
for his purchase in English notes. The bank had been warned days in
advance that a customer was requiring a large sum in American money, so
they were prepared. The description of the youth who made the exchange
corresponded with the description furnished of Ernie.</p>

<p>Boiled down, it was a vulgar, commonplace bank theft, an "inside
job" readily engineered, because of loose clerical systems, by an
employee. It had its hundreds of parallels, and differed in only one
respect from a score of similar cases.</p>

<p>In that one respect, however, the difference was marked. Ernie had
no vices. He did not bet, he did not speculate. Mr. Reeder, however,
knew differently. He interpreted that reference to oil in his letter to
Ena, and it was not so difficult to see how the clerk had fallen into
the toils. A large number of oil properties are advertised in the agony
columns of the leading daily newspapers in the course of the year, and
not all of these are genuine. A sensible proportion are inserted by
sharks who are quite happy if they touch the little money of the
hazardous speculator. Who was the shark?</p>

<p>Later in the day all the documents which had been collected from
Ernie's desk were sent by train to London, and Mr. Reeder examined them
very carefully. He had already sent a clerk to search the files of the
leading dailies for advertisements extolling the potentialities of
undeveloped oil-fields. Happily, he had English newspapers to deal
with; had this happened in New York a few years before, not a clerk,
but an army of clerks would have been required to check up these
flattering offers.</p>

<p>Ernie's interest in oil had begun less than twelve months before, if
he could judge by the letters, and had probably started with his
reading of books on the world's oil production. A copy of one of these
was found in his lodgings, well thumbed and annotated--he had left it
behind when he had made his hurried flight. Mr. Reeder had therefore
been fairly accurate in putting a year as the period to be covered by
the searcher after alluring newspapers.</p>

<p>It made a formidable and voluminous collection of documents when it
came into Mr. Reeder's hands that night. By the morning these would be
checked up and the advertisers traced, if they were traceable.</p>

<p>Descriptions of the wanted man had been circulated by telegraph
especially to motor-hire companies and to garage proprietors. At eight
o'clock that evening Mr. Reeder was called on the telephone by the
Chief Constable of Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>"We've traced that boy, Mr. Reeder. Do you remember the case of a
motor car being found on the side of the Shrewton road, burnt out?"</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder almost jumped out of his chair. One of his stories was
coming true!</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, that was his! He gave the name of Stevenson. The garage
proprietor recognised the photograph."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>J. G. WAITED up till three in the morning to hear the report of the
officer who had been sent specially down to examine the car and to
gather fuller particulars. The car had been deliberately set on fire.
That had been the police theory from the moment they found two empty
petrol tins thrown into a near-by ditch. The number-plate had been
broken off, and the machine had been identified by the chassis number.
The newest discovery that the police made was that the car had been set
on fire by a delayed fuse, and probably did not burst into flame until
nearly half an hour after the man had deserted it.</p>

<p>Stevenson had also been identified by the proprietor of an inn at
Andover. The boy had arrived late at night, driving the car which was
afterwards found burnt, and had ordered supper, which was served to him
in the coffee room. He carried with him a small suit-case, was very
pale and agitated, and one of the waiters had remarked to the manager
of the inn that he thought the visitor had been crying! He was
certainly in a state bordering upon hysteria.</p>

<p>After he had finished and paid for his supper, saying that he was
going on to Bournemouth, something went wrong with his car. He could
not start it, and he behaved like a lunatic, screaming and raving at
the motor mechanic who tried to put the matter right. The car required
very little treatment; Mr. "Stevenson" had forgotten to switch on the
ignition.</p>

<p>All the time he was at the inn he did not let go of his suit-case,
and when he drove off it was between the steering column and his left
knee.</p>

<p>At first the burnt-out car had not been connected in the mind of the
motor mechanic with the Stevenson car. It was not until he saw it in a
police station yard that he recognised it and reported his suspicions
to the local inspector.</p>

<p>Now, to make Mr. Reeder's story true, this young man <i>had</i> to
be hysterical! If he was calm and collected and in full possession of
his senses, what had happened that fatal night was impossible.
Certainly no packets of bank-notes would have been discovered on the
tops of hayricks and in ditches; no eminent master of Eton would have
been struck down and destroyed without warning.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder could claim, though he never made such a claim, that he
had known from the very beginning that Ernie was a bank clerk. He had
an extensive knowledge of business papers; he knew the paper of the
Central and Southern Bank, because the lower right-hand corner was
invariably cut off as bank-notes are cut; and he knew that Ernie was a
clerk, because bank clerks have a trick of making flourishes with their
pens before they write, the reason being the necessity for making
absolutely sure of the statement or figures they are copying, the
flourish giving them just that amount of time to check up.</p>

<p>But bank clerks are not necessarily thieves because they possess
money and give expensive presents to girls. Mr. Reeder was certain that
if the explosive Sir Wilfred had been aware that he was in possession
of these facts he would have regarded him as an accessory; but Sir
Wilfred did not know, and Mr. Reeder's conscience was clear. That was
one of the peculiar qualities of Mr. Reeder's conscience, that nothing
clouded it.</p>

<p>He secured a powerful car from the police, and went alone on a
voyage of discovery, the area of his search being Buckinghamshire. A
search of the records of a certain ministry had told him practically
nothing. Mr. Mannering, who was also Mr. Hymie Higson, might have a
real name--it was certainly neither Mannering nor Higson.</p>

<p>Reeder made many calls. If he had a weakness it was for working
alone; and if he had a vice it was that he was uncommunicative. There
were Scotland Yard officers who complained bitterly that he worked for
"solo glory." But to do him the barest justice, Mr. Reeder never
bothered about glory, any more than a man who plays a difficult game of
patience takes any comfort from the thought that his success will win
the plaudits of the crowd.</p>

<p>That was his system, to play patience in a closed room for the
satisfaction of his own curiosity. If he failed, as he sometimes
failed, he published his discredit; if he succeeded, he often hugged
his triumph to himself, and none knew how great it was.</p>

<p>So that when he went down into Buckinghamshire he told nobody, and
at the end of the day, after he had been deposited in Whitehall and the
car dismissed, he stopped only long enough to eat muffins at a near-by
restaurant before he strolled away to Paddington and travelled by train
to Maidenhead. Here he chartered a cab, and in the darkness of the
night was deposited near the home of Mr. or Captain Mannering.</p>

<p>The iron gates were closed; the wall in their vicinity was
formidable. A quarter of a mile along a side road the ground was more
vulnerable. In the dark of night Mr. Reeder found himself trudging
through dead bracken to his objective.</p>

<hr align="center" width="50%">

<p>Ena Panton might, as her keeper said, be "dumb," but she had the
power of shrewd observation. One of the first things she observed,
after she had settled down to her captivity, was that her prison had
been most carefully prepared for her. It was as though her gaoler had
planned her abduction weeks before he carried her away. The windows
were shuttered, and the shutters were screwed into place so that they
could not be opened. A ventilator grating had been recently placed in a
wall high up out of reach, and a certain number of books had been
provided for her entertainment. They were not books in which she
herself was greatly interested, being mainly elementary works of
science, two or three books about oil and oil-fields, and an amount of
other literature equally dry and equally unappealing.</p>

<p>A day after her arrival a new set of books made their appearance,
more to her liking. With them came magazines, fashion papers and the
more interesting of the illustrated weeklies.</p>

<p>She challenged Hymie, with whom she was now on almost friendly
terms.</p>

<p>"You've been planning to get somebody here for a long time."</p>

<p>"How did you know that?"</p>

<p>"Look at all the preparations you've made," she indicated, and he
smiled.</p>

<p>"True, O dumbell!" he said. "Fancy you noticing that! Yes, I've been
looking forward to the pleasure for a month."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, you haven't. You had this place prepared for somebody else--for
Ernie."</p>

<p>He stared at her.</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?" he asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I've got a feeling. Where is Ernie?"</p>

<p>"He's gone abroad."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked, and he sighed wearily.</p>

<p>"How many times have I told you not to ask questions?"</p>

<p>He went to the end of the room, pulled aside a curtain that hid a
heavy door, and unlocked it.</p>

<p>"Come along for your little walk," he said. "Put your coat on--it's
cold."</p>

<p>She struggled into the coat he had bought for her, and together they
passed through the door on to a landing and down an outside staircase
into the dark grounds. At first she had refused to go out with him, and
he had not insisted.</p>

<p>"If you want to keep well you've got to take some exercise," he
said. "If you prefer to live inside you can--the only thing I can tell
you is that you're not going out by yourself."</p>

<p>She saw the wisdom of the arrangement, and the second night when he
invited her she went with him meekly. She could see nothing except
trees, and far away a dull red glow in the sky. She asked him where
this was, and he refused to tell her.</p>

<p>"London?" she suggested.</p>

<p>"Very likely," was the answer.</p>

<p>On this, the fourth night, he took her out and she was feeling at
her friendliest, was curious rather than frightened, questioned him as
to what he intended doing with her and how eventually she was to be
disposed of. He would have liked to supply a practical answer, for he
was already feeling the embarrassment of her presence.</p>

<p>They were returning after a longer walk than usual. She had reached
the foot of the stairs, when suddenly, without the least warning, he
picked her up in his arms and kissed her. She fought back at him like a
tiger cat, battling with wild rage. He said nothing, followed her when
she went up the stairs and locked the door upon her. When he brought in
her supper she retreated to a corner of the room, watching him.</p>

<p>"It's all right, you fool," he growled. "I lost my head, that's
all--too much moonlight in my system."</p>

<p>If she could only get the key of that door! He carried it in his
side pocket, making no attempt to hide the fact. She practised picking
pockets, hung a woollen jacket over the back of a chair and filched
from the pocket nuts that she had saved over from her meal. In a few
hours she felt herself an adept, but he never gave her another
opportunity, kept away from her, and she dared not risk a closer
approach.</p>

<p>That night she went to bed with a sense of apprehension, fastened a
chair under the knob of the main door leading to the building. It was
nine o'clock when she retired. She woke two hours later suddenly and
instantly. She had heard a sound, the stealthy movement of a key in a
lock, and it came from the direction of the door that led down into the
grounds.</p>

<p>In an instant she was out of the bed, switched on the light and
slipped into her dressing-gown. She was white and shaking; her knees
all but gave way under her as she moved stealthily across the room in
the direction whence the sound had come.</p>

<p>There it was, a queer, tinkling noise, the fumbling of steel against
steel.</p>

<p>"Go away!" she called shrilly. "If you come in I'll kill you. I have
a knife."</p>

<p>The noise ceased. She waited tensely, listening. There was no other
sound, but when she put her ear to the door she thought she heard feet
moving.</p>

<p>There came another sound that sent her spinning round. A key had
been thrust in the main door at the other end of the room, the lock
snapped back, and Hymie came in, glowering.</p>

<p>"What are you trying to do--make a getaway? Go back to bed."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it you...trying to get through that door?" She pointed.</p>

<p>"That door?"</p>

<p>His voice changed. Crossing the room swiftly, and taking a key out
of his pocket as he came, he unlocked the door and pulled it open.
Nobody stood on the landing outside, nor was any person visible on the
narrow stairs.</p>

<p>"Is this a fairy story or are you--"</p>

<p>He saw something, and, stooping, touched the landing. It was a wet
footmark; his fingers, when he examined it, were muddy. Somebody had
been there recently.</p>

<p>Locking the door, he hurried from the room and was gone a few
minutes. When he returned he was wearing an overcoat and carrying a
hand-lamp, and with this he examined the landing and the stairs. He
tried the door at the foot of these; it was unlocked, and he was
certain that he had locked it behind him when he had come in. It was
raining; the ground under his feet was wet.</p>

<p>Hurrying back the way he came, he passed through the girl's room,
and along a passage down the wide stairs to the hall. A man was sitting
there, reading by the shaded light of a lamp. It was the thick-set man
who had torn off the bolt in Ena's room.</p>

<p>"Wake up the boys," said Hymie. "Get Janny up from the cottage."</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" asked the man, putting down his newspaper.</p>

<p>"Somebody tried to get into the house through the outside
staircase."</p>

<p>The man grinned.</p>

<p>"Burglars?" he asked sardonically, and Hymie showed his teeth to
him.</p>

<p>"Do as you're told, will you!" he snarled.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder's visit to the neighbourhood had not passed unnoticed. It
had been disconcerting, but there was no immediate cause for alarm. He
did not doubt for a moment that Reeder knew he was living here under
the name of Captain Mannering; but Reeder would not suspect that the
girl was here, and Hymie's greatest secret of all was hidden beyond
fear of discovery.</p>

<p>Hymie was no ordinary criminal; he maintained an intelligence staff
in unsuspected places. No search warrant could be applied for and
issued without his knowledge--he banked upon this. The very hint that
such a warrant was on its way would be sufficient to start him moving.
But he had questioned his informant only that night over the telephone,
and had been completely assured that Scotland Yard was not taking the
step he most dreaded.</p>

<p>Reeder was different. Hymie knew the detective by repute. He did
things which officialdom would never sanction, and a search warrant,
for J. G. Reeder, was an absurd superfluity. It was Reeder; nobody but
Reeder would dare...Reeder had probably watched him as he had come from
the stairway.</p>

<p>When he had got his men together Hymie explained his plan.</p>

<p>"I'm taking this girl to France to-night," he said.</p>

<p>"She ought to have gone there first. I'll arrange to have her looked
after and be back by to-morrow night. Have a car ready, and 'phone the
hangar."</p>

<p>Hymie had served in the Air Force during the war, and he owned a
powerful little two-seater 'plane that had been very useful to him. He
housed this in a field behind Wycombe, but, as Mr. Reeder had
suspected, the flying licence he held was issued neither to Mr. Higson
nor Captain Mannering.</p>

<p>"I'll bet you that's what he's been looking for," said one of the
men, and Hymie turned on him sharply.</p>

<p>"Who do you mean--Reeder?"</p>

<p>"He hasn't been snooping around the country for nothing," the man
went on. "Didn't you say that when you met him at the club he was
asking you why you left bundles of bank-notes lying around?"</p>

<p>"That was a guess," said Hymie hastily.</p>

<p>The man shook his head. It was the gardener who lived at the
cottage, and he had excellent reason for knowing Reeder.</p>

<p>"He came here the day we got those damned chickens in," he said,
"and I was sitting at the door of the cottage when his van passed. He
couldn't help recognising me--he had me for a snide job four years ago,
and that fellow is camera-eyed! If he knows you, he knows your record.
He knows you're an airman, and that's why he's been down here--looking
for the hangar. And if he's down here to-night, he's looking for the
girl. If you take my advice, guv'nor, you'll have all the cars round
and beat it."</p>

<p>Hymie considered this proposition, and it seemed reasonable. He had
been a fool ever to hamper himself with this brainless little typist.
On the face of it, this dangerous adventure had the appearance of a
supreme act of folly. It is possible that Hymie thought there might be
a pleasant solution, for he was not without his attractions.</p>

<p>"Get the cars ready. I'll go up and tell her," he said.</p>

<p>He ran up the stairs, along the passage, and, unlocking the door,
flung it open. The room was in darkness.</p>

<p>"Get up and dress," he commanded. "We're going a little trip."</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>He took a step to the left, felt for the light switch and turned
it.</p>

<p>"Don't move," said Mr. Reeder's amiable voice.</p>

<p>He was sitting at the table, his square hat on the back of his head,
his woollen muffler untidily disposed about his neck, and in his
mittened hand was a long-barrelled automatic.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>FOR a second Hymie stared at him, dazed, shattered. He was paralysed
to inaction for just the time it takes a man to count twenty.</p>

<p>"The young lady is waiting for me outside the other door--" began
Mr. Reeder.</p>

<p>Hymie moved swiftly. With one hand he knocked up the light switch
and the room was in darkness. In another second he was flying along the
corridor and down the stairs. There was nobody in the hall. Hymie
jumped for the front door, and, flinging it open, flew out into the
night. He wore thin slippers and a dressing-gown. He scarcely noticed
the gravel under his feet as he tore down the drive just as the first
of the cars backed out of the garage behind the cottage.</p>

<p>"Get the gate open!" he roared</p>

<p>One of the men flew to the gate, turned the key and pulled, but the
iron barrier moved only a few inches and then stuck. Somebody had
slipped a handcuff around two bars, that effectively held it.</p>

<p>"Get an axe," breathed Hymie; "quick!"</p>

<p>One of the men ran into the garage and came back with a crowbar. It
would seem a simple matter to smash one steel link, but it was nearly
three minutes before the connecting handcuff was broken and the gate
swung open.</p>

<p>"Your tyres are flat," said a hateful voice from the darkness.
"I--um-- took the liberty of deflating them. And even if I
hadn't--"</p>

<p>As he spoke there came a whirr of wheels. A big car drew up with a
jerk opposite the gate and across the path, barring all escape. Hymie
turned and fled across the little park. He saw a dark figure standing
by the side of the drive and fired from his hip. It was all that was
necessary for Mr. Reeder, for he was a law-abiding man and could not
bring himself to shoot unless he were shot at. Two sharp reports
followed; Hymie felt the sting of a bullet in his thigh; one leg gave
under him and he went crashing to the ground.</p>

<hr align="center" width="50%">

<p>"Oh, yes," said Mr. Reeder apologetically, "I am afraid I did go
down into Buckinghamshire without notifying Scotland Yard. But being,
as I have always insisted, a--um--timid man, I did take the precaution
of telephoning to the Buckinghamshire police, telling them what I was
doing, and asking them to send a squad car to pick me up in an hour's
time.</p>

<p>"I have always known that this pleasant country retreat was occupied
by at least two crooks. The prosperity of Mr. Hymie Higson was such
that I should have been foolish to the point of recklessness if I had
not detailed one of my assistants to trail him; and once he was
trailed, there was no difficulty at all in establishing the fact that
Captain Mannering and Hymie were one and the same person.</p>

<p>"I was puzzled as to why Hymie should purchase a country estate,
even though that estate was purchased very cheaply, until I made an
examination of his American record, and found that his favourite pose
was that of country gentleman, in which role he had fleeced quite a
number of distinguished but unintelligent young men of the <i>jeunesse
dor&eacute;e</i>--a foreign expression meaning, I believe, the golden
youth.</p>

<p>"Whether Hymie originally intended to try that method of earning a
livelihood in England on his release from prison, or whether it was
forced upon him by the circumstances of finding the mug--if you will
pardon the expression--I have not yet discovered. It is certain that he
was in the habit of advertising oil properties for sale, and that he
was by this means enabled to secure quite a considerable sum of money
from various dupes. When first he heard from the unfortunate Ernest
Graddle, he may not have realised the extent of his good fortune.
Later, when they met, and Graddle handed to him a sum which he knew no
bank clerk could have obtained honestly, it is possible that, under the
threat of exposure, he learned the system by which Graddle had been
robbing the bank of small sums for many years.</p>

<p>"Once he knew this, the rest was easy. Graddle made a systematic
attack upon the account of a rich man who entrusted his money to the
bank, and by a method so simple that a child of ten could have defeated
it, was able to go on deceiving his manager, hoodwinking the
inspectors--the reference in his letter was obviously to a bank
inspector--and extracting huge sums, which he, like all people engaged
in embezzlement, imagined he would be able to return when fortune
smiled upon him, and delivering instantly the bulk of these monies to
Mr. Hymie Higson.</p>

<p>"They were never seen together in London after their first meeting.
Hymie was too clever to associate himself physically with a thief who,
sooner or later, would be found out. They had certain rendezvous where
they met; a flat in the Haymarket, a Maidenhead pleasure garden, and
one or two other places which I have not yet been able to trace.</p>

<p>"On one of his excursions to London Ernest Graddle met a girl with
whom he fell violently in love. She was undoubtedly pretty, and
although she was poor, that fact would not weigh heavily with this
young man who, if he had lived on his salary, would have been in her
class. He bought her presents, gave her sums of money, and when the
strain of his deception began to grow on him, made arrangements to
marry her.</p>

<p>"The girl had social instincts, and asked that the engagement might
be announced. Ernest agreed, I imagine, with some reluctance, and must
subsequently have told Hymie, who would be furious. Such an
announcement might attract attention to the girl, and indirectly to the
young man. Immediately he obtained the offending advertisement, and in
the course of his visit to Deptford learned that Ena's sister was in my
employ. That, I--um--flatter myself, must have been a shock to Mr.
Higson. I may be taking an immodest view of the--um--terror of my name,
but I think I am right in saying that he was shocked.</p>

<p>"Naturally, he disguised himself when he came. In no circumstances
must he be identified as having the least connection with Ernest
Graddle. I imagine--though he will not confess this much--that he
insisted upon the young man making one big steal and bolting. Then it
was that Ernest was obstinate, insisted that he could not live without
Ena Panton, though it was probably not until the night before he bolted
that he confessed that he had broken his promise, and had again
communicated with Ena and had sent her a portion of the stolen money,
which he had changed into American currency.</p>

<p>"When Hymie learned that he had sent a package of bills to the girl
he must have been beside himself with fury. The bills could be traced
and the inevitable exposure precipitated. He must also have been having
a very trying time with Ernest Graddle, who was love-sick, mad with
fear and remorse, and in a state bordering upon dementia.</p>

<p>"The only evidence we have is the evidence given by the motor
mechanic at Andover, and his description of Ernest is, I should
imagine, a fairly faithful one.</p>

<p>"Hymie's plan was as follows. He would fly in the afternoon to
Salisbury Plain, land in the dark--he is one of the cleverest night
fliers that ever was thrown out of the Air Force--and Ernest was to go
by road and pick him up at an agreed spot which was a quarter of a mile
beyond Stonehenge. Hymie seems to have landed on the plain without
attracting any attention. There is a big aerodrome within a few miles,
and the appearance of a plane, even late at night, would not be
regarded as remarkable.</p>

<p>"He must have told Ernest that he was taking him out of the country,
probably to the South of France. In reality he had other plans. Ernest
was too dangerous a man to be left at large in France where, when the
robbery was known, his description would be circulated, and where most
certainly he would be free to telegraph the girl to join him.</p>

<p>"A room had been prepared, a prison room, at Hymie's country house,
and after the car had arrived, the baggage transferred to the plane,
and the car saturated, and left with a delayed action firer, the
machine took off without mishap. They could not have gone far before
Ernest made the discovery that the 'plane was going in the wrong
direction, and then Hymie must have told him the truth--that it was too
dangerous for him to go abroad, and that he was taking him to a safe
hiding place.</p>

<p>"What happened after this one can only conjecture. The boy was
hysterical, mad with fear and fury. He may have suspected Hymie and
threatened that none of the money in the suit-case should be his. He
certainly opened it, with the intention of flinging its contents over
the side of the 'plane. Two packets, and probably more, were actually
jettisoned, before Hymie turned upon the demented young man and struck
him with an iron spanner which lay to his hand. There was probably a
struggle, in the course of which the spanner fell over the side of the
aeroplane--with tragic results, as we know, for it struck an
unoffending Eton master and killed him.</p>

<p>"If you take a map of the south of England and you draw a more or
less straight line from the place where Hymie picked up his passenger
to the hangar, you will see that it crosses Farnham, Windsor and
Cookham, the slight deviation in those tracks being caused by a heavy
ground mist which lay over a portion of Wiltshire, and which the airman
was at some pains to avoid.</p>

<p>"I don't know how many times Ernest was struck. He was undoubtedly
dead when the 'plane came to earth at the flying field which Hymie had
first rented and subsequently bought.</p>

<p>"What was done immediately with the body it is impossible at the
moment to say. It may have been left all day in the hangar. The
evidence I have is that the shed was locked throughout that day, and
that a man sat outside or wandered about it, not attempting to seek
shelter, though the day was very wet and gusty.</p>

<p>"Higson's danger was not yet over. There remained the girl, and that
ill-fated package of twenty-five thousand dollars, which was all the
more significant since the mysterious discovery of similar packages on
a Hampshire farm. It might be that he was even more concerned with the
possibility that the young man had written very fully to his
sweetheart, giving particulars of his crime, or, what was as bad,
naming a rendezvous where they could meet. If I may be allowed the
immodesty, the situation was further complicated by the fact that I was
already in the case, and had seen both Ena and her sister. When I met
Hymie at the club he was on his way to perform this bold stroke.</p>

<p>"The need for silencing the girl was an urgent one. This young lady
tells me that he threatened to kill her, and I have not the slightest
doubt that if she had been less attractive he would have put his threat
into execution. As it was, she has taken no harm, and has something to
talk about for the rest of her life, besides figuring--and this will
give her the greatest pleasure--in an interesting murder trial. The
moment her portrait is published in the newspapers she will receive
hundreds of offers of marriage from that half-witted section of the
population which exists for no other purpose than to offer marriage to
notorious persons. So that, generally speaking, I do not think we need
waste our sympathy on this young lady, and I am especially asking the
bank, in view of the information she was able to give to me, to refrain
from demanding the jewels which were donated to her by her unhappy
lover. Oh, yes, she knows he is dead, and she has paid him the tribute
of her--um--lamentations.</p>

<p>"Hymie went down to Deptford and carried out his plan as arranged.
It was easier than he had imagined, and, as he had a hiding-place
already prepared for her lover, there was no insuperable difficulty
about finding some place where she could be hidden. Exactly what he
intended doing eventually, I do not care to think.</p>

<p>"That gentleman is the solution of many minor mysteries, and,
incidentally, releases from suspicion the three violent socialists who
on a certain occasion had threatened Mr. Friston, and are, I believe,
at this moment under police observation."</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder had an audience consisting of the heads of Scotland Yard,
the chiefs of the Berkshire police and the Assistant Public Prosecutor.
There was also an official stenographer.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Mr. Reeder," said Grayson. "A very interesting
story, and I have no doubt we shall be able to check up every point.
You've done marvellously, though I've always had in my mind the
possibility that the discovery of the money at Farnham had something to
do with the murder of the Eton gentleman--"</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder murmured something; whether derisive or not, nobody could
quite gather.</p>

<p>"I think, sir"--Grayson addressed the Assistant Public
Prosecutor--"the matter may be left now in our hands."</p>

<p>"Where is the body?" asked Mr. Reeder. There was a little glint in
his eyes, as though he were enjoying a secret joke.</p>

<p>"We'll find that--I had a talk to Hymie in the cells this morning,
and of course he denied everything, and said exactly what you're
saying: 'Find the body. You can't prosecute a man for murder without a
body. I think that's the law.' But we'll find it--with the assistance
of our friends from Berkshire," he added politely.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder scratched his chin.</p>

<p>"You won't want my assistance in that respect? I have made a few
inquiries--"</p>

<p>"No, no, no, you can leave it to us, Mr. Reeder."</p>

<p>There is nothing malicious about a Scotland Yard officer, very
little petty jealousy, but since an official of that institution
depends for his very living and his promotion upon discoveries for
which he himself can take credit, he was not unnaturally desirous of
coming in at the end. The Chief Constable said as much to the Assistant
Public Prosecutor as they were walking along Whitehall to lunch.</p>

<p>"We'll have to come back to old Reeder. He's a sly old dog, and if
Grayson hadn't been so cocky we should have known all the facts by
now," he said, and here he was right.</p>

<p>Mr. Grayson had undertaken the most difficult problem of the case.
An army of detectives searched house and grounds, dug up foundations,
overturned hearth-stones, dragged the river, made examinations of
garage floors, but the body of the murdered man was not discovered. It
was the one secret which J. G. Reeder had not revealed.</p>

<p>He was an assiduous reader of American magazines and especially
those lurid representatives of the magazine press which dealt with
crime. And had not Hymie Higson once most incautiously mentioned the
truth machine? And had not Mr. Reeder read the very article?</p>

<p>"There is only one place to hide a body," he said, when the
Assistant Public Prosecutor hinted that for his own private information
he would like to know his assistant's theory. "Have you ever heard of
an elderly tramp named Peters? The name is unfamiliar to you, sir? It
was unfamiliar to me. I never met the man in my life, partly because I
do not associate with tramps, and partly because I did not know tramps
had names. But there was such a person--Peters the tramp."</p>

<p>"You're being mysterious," smiled his chief.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder shook his head. He was a little indignant that such a
charge should be brought against him.</p>

<p>"There's no mystery except the peculiar workings of my mind. I have
heard of the man Peters and of Hymie's great generosity to him--perhaps
if you mention this to Scotland Yard, sir, they will immediately leap
at the solution. As it is, I fear it is going to be difficult to bring
home to Mr. Higson, or Mannering, or Brates--that is the name in which
his aeroplane licence was issued--the responsibility for the death of
this unfortunate young man."</p>

<p>Hymie held the same view. His confidence grew with the remands which
were ordered of his case. Neither the wheedling, the threatening nor
the bluff of police officers shook him. Eventually Mr. Reeder was sent
for-- Scotland Yard had capitulated.</p>

<p>"We can't get this bird to talk, and all our efforts to find the
body have come to nothing," said Grayson irritably.</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder produced from his overcoat pocket a magazine with an
horrific cover.</p>

<p>"You may not have read this publication," he said; "but I subscribe
to it, and so apparently does Mr. Higson or Mannering or Brates.
Indeed, I learned some years ago that with the big shots of American
crime this is the most favoured publication. It tells of past murders
and of interesting developments in criminal detection. Not the least
interesting of these is an article on the truth machine, the invention
of a young Chicago scientist. A band is placed round the chest, another
round the arm, and a cardiograph is taken. A man so treated is asked a
question, and if he tells the truth the little pointer on the ribbon
shows no visible sign of agitation. If he lies, the pointer swings left
and right, and the farther it swings the bigger is the lie. If you
peruse this article you will read the story of a young motor salesman
who disappeared, and was suspected of being murdered. The man so
suspected was arrested and put under examination. The inquiry was never
completed, because the criminal, realising his danger, secured an
injunction from a Supreme Court judge to stop the experiment. But
before it was arrested he had revealed several interesting facts.
First, that he had killed the man he was supposed to have killed;
secondly, that he had buried him in a certain section of space;
thirdly, that the place he had chosen for burial was--a cemetery!"</p>

<p>Grayson gasped.</p>

<p>"A cemetery?"</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder nodded.</p>

<p>"I can imagine no more suitable place," he said. "It is certainly
the last place you would disturb in your search. On the day following
the murder of the young clerk, a tramp named Peters who had died in the
neighbourhood was to have been buried in a common grave. Some unknown
benefactor bought the plot, so that he should rest alone. That same
night the grave was re-opened, and the body of Ernest Graddle was also
interred."</p>

<hr align="center" width="50%">

<p>About three months after Hymie Higson was effectively disposed of by
the officers of the law, Lizzie the parlourmaid asked Mr. Reeder for a
day off.</p>

<p>"Ena's getting married," she said, "to such a nice boy! She's ever
so fond of him, and after all the poor girl's been through, it's a
blessing! And do you know, Mr. Reeder, that the police won't give her
back all those bank-notes that were taken away from her? They say the
money belongs to the bank, although Ernie gave it to her, and if they
took away the notes why didn't they take away her rings?"</p>

<p>Mr. Reeder was too weary to discuss a matter of ethics.</p>

<p>"Take your day off, Elizabeth," he said, "and be so kind as to bring
me some muffins."</p>

<p>THE END</p>
