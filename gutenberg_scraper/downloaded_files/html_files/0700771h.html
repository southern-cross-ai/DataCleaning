  <h2><a name="chap01"
     id="chap01">I. &mdash; THE MAGIC OF FEAR</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Grand Magazine</i>, Vol. 49, Mar-Aug 1926</h3>

  <p class="first">ALL this happened in the interim between excellencies, or it
  could hardly have happened at all.</p>

  <p>His Excellency, the retiring Administrator of the Reserved Territories,
  had departed amidst the banging of guns and the playing of the national
  anthem by a small band of near-white musicians, all of whom, and especially
  the cornet, had a tendency to play flat. The new Excellency was enduring the
  agony of gout at his house in Budleigh Salterton in Devon, and his departure
  from home was indefinitely postponed.</p>

  <p>A change of administration made little or no difference to the people of
  the big river, and Captain Hamilton of the King's Houssas, for one, was
  hardly conscious of the lacuna as he strode savagely towards the hut which
  housed his youthful second in command.</p>

  <p>His annoyance was well warranted, for Lieutenant Tibbets had committed the
  unpardonable crime of writing to the newspapers&mdash;a weakness of his.
  Hamilton was moist and furious, for the afternoon sun blistered the world,
  and as he crossed the yellow oven-floor called a parade-ground, the heat of
  it came through the soles of his boots and tortured him.</p>

  <p>The barrack hutments which formed one side of the square danced and
  shimmered in the heat haze; he saw the fronds of the Isisi palms in a blur;
  even the weaver birds were silent; when it grows too hot for the weavers to
  talk, it is very hot indeed.</p>

  <p>Kicking open the door of Lieutenant Tibbetts's hut, he stepped in and
  snorted his disgust. Mr. Tibbetts, whose other name was Bones, lay face
  upward on the top of his bed; and he was arrayed in a costume beyond
  forgiveness, for not Solomon in all his glory wore purple pyjamas with
  alternate green and ochre stripes.</p>

  <p>Hamilton flung down upon the table the paper he had been carrying as Bones
  opened one eye.</p>

  <p>'"Morning, sir," he said, slightly dazed. "Is it still raining?"</p>

  <p>"'Morning!" snapped Hamilton. "It is within an hour of dinner, and I've
  something to say to you. Bones!"</p>

  <p>Bones relapsed into slumber.</p>

  <p>"Wake up, and hide your hideous feet!"</p>

  <p>The eyelids of the sleeper fluttered; he murmured something about not
  seeing the point&mdash;he had at least seen the newspaper, and recognised the
  Gothic title-piece.</p>

  <p>"The point is. Bones," said Hamilton awfully, "nobody knows better than
  you that it is an offence for any officer to write to the newspapers on any
  subject! This"&mdash;he liked the folded newspaper on the table&mdash;"this
  is an outrage!"</p>

  <p>"<i>Surrey Star</i> and <i>Middlesex Plain Dealer</i>, sir," murmured
  Bones, his eyes closed, a picture of patience, forbearance and resignation,
  "with which, sir, is incorporated the Sunbury Herald and Molesey Times,
  sir."</p>

  <p>His long body was stretched luxuriously, his hands were clasped beneath
  his head, his large red feet overhung the end of the bed. He had the air and
  manner of one who was deeply wronged but forgave his enemies.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter what paper you write to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'To which you write,' dear old officer," murmured Bones. "Let us be jolly
  old grammarians, sir, an' superior; don't let us go around debasin' the
  language&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Get up, you insubordinate devil, and stand on your big feet!" hissed the
  Captain of Houssas; but Lieutenant Tibbetts did not so much as open his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Is this a friendly discussion, or isn't it, dear old sir?" he pleaded.
  "Is it a friendly call or a council of war, dear old Ham?"</p>

  <p>Hamilton gripped him by the silk collar of his pyjama coat and jerked him
  to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Assault!" said Bones quietly. "Mad with envy, captain strikes risin' an'
  brilliant young officer. Court-martial finds jolly old captain guilty, and he
  takes poison!"</p>

  <p>"A newspaper man you will never be," said Hamilton. (Here Bones bowed
  gravely.) "You can't spell, for one thing!"</p>

  <p>"Neither could dear old Napoleon," said Bones firmly, "nor dinky old
  Washington&mdash;spellin' is a sign of a weak mind. You're a good speller, I
  admit it, dear old Demosthenes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The point is this&mdash;and I'm perfectly serious"&mdash;Hamilton pushed
  his junior on to the bed, and he collapsed obediently&mdash;"you really must
  not write political articles, suggesting that the Secretary of State should
  come and 'see with his own eyes'"&mdash;Hamilton sought for the offending
  paragraph and read it&mdash;"'... the work that is being carried out by young
  officers unknown (except by the indigenous natives, who adore them) and
  unhonoured...'&mdash;of all the rubbish!"</p>

  <p>Bones shrugged his narrow shoulders; his silence was offensively
  respectful.</p>

  <p>"You'll not write any more of these self-advertising letters, Bones
  &mdash;either to the Star, the Comet, the Moon, the Sun, or any other member
  of the solar system."</p>

  <p>"Let us keep religion out of the discussion, dear old Ham," said Bones in
  a hushed voice.</p>

  <p>It is doubtful whether Mr. Nickerson Haben had even heard of the existence
  of that organ of public conscience, the <i>Surrey Star</i> and <i>Middlesex
  Plain Dealer</i>. He was not the type of man who gave a thought to any
  newspaper that had a circulation of less than half a million.</p>

  <p>And yet, the appearance of this literary effort of Bones coincided with a
  peculiar moment of crisis in his life, and the sequel almost excused the
  subsequent jubilation of the Surrey Star and went far to consolidate the
  editor's claim that "What the Sun thinks today, the Government does
  tomorrow!"</p>

  <p>For Nickerson Haben went almost at once to examine the Territories with
  his own eyes. He was in the middle thirties and had the globe at his feet.
  How this came to be the case, nobody troubled to consider.</p>

  <p>A narrow-chested and pallid man with heavy raven hair, one lock of which
  hung over his forehead in moments of oratorical excess, he was deep-eyed,
  thin-lipped, hollow-faced, and had hands white and long. Nickerson was swept
  into the House of Commons in a whirlwind of oratory that blew down a phalanx
  of sober men and conservative citizens which stood between. Silver-tongued,
  or glib, according to your political prejudices, he carried his powers of
  suasion and criticism into the chaste and unemotional atmosphere of
  Parliament. So that Ministers squirmed uneasily under the razor-edge of his
  gibes; and the Whips, foregathering in the lobby, grew pettish at the mention
  of his name. A party man, he never fell into the error of wounding the
  susceptibilities of his own keaders; if he criticised them at all, he merely
  repeated, in tones of finality, the half-confessions of fallacies they had
  already made.</p>

  <p>When a Government fell, Mr. Haben, deserting a safe seat, fought West
  Monrouth County, turned out the sitting member and returned to Westminster in
  triumph.</p>

  <p>The new Government made him an Under-Secretary, first of Agriculture, then
  of Foreign Affairs. He had married the widow of Cornelius Beit, an American
  lady, fifteen years his senior&mdash;a clever woman with a violent temper and
  a complete knowledge of men. Their home life, though it was lived at Carlton
  House Terrace, was not happy. She knew him rather too well; his own temper
  was none of the sweetest. He had all the arrogance of a self-made man who had
  completed the process just a little too young. She once told a near friend
  that Nickerson had a streak of commonness which she found it difficult to
  endure, and there was even talk of a divorce.</p>

  <p>That was just before her operation for appendicitis. The best surgeon in
  England performed; her recovery was never in doubt. Nickerson, under the
  spell of her recovery, went down to the House and delivered the best speech
  of his life on the subject of Baluchistan.</p>

  <p>Three days later she was dead&mdash;there had occurred one of those
  curious relapses which are so inexplicable to the layman, so dreaded by the
  medical profession. Haben was like a man stunned. Those who hated
  him&mdash;many&mdash;wondered what he would do now, with the principal source
  of income departed. They had time for no further than a brief speculation,
  the matter being decided when the will was read, leaving him
  everything&mdash;except for a legacy to a maid.</p>

  <p>This tragedy occurred between excellencies, an opportunity seized upon by
  a sympathetic chief. Nickerson Haben went out on the first African mail-boat,
  to combine business with recreation; to find flaws and forgetfulness.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbetts, of the King's Houssas, was the newsman of
  headquarters. The lank legs of this thin, monocled lad had brought many
  tidings of joy and calamity, mostly exaggerated.</p>

  <p>Now he came flying across the lemon sands of the beach, a mail-bag in his
  hand, his helmet at the back of his head, surprising truth in his mouth.</p>

  <p>He took the five steps of the stoep in one stride, dashed into the big,
  cool dining-room where Hamilton sat at breakfast, and dropped the bag into
  his superior's lap at the precise moment when Captain Hamilton's coffee-cup
  was delicately poised.</p>

  <p>"Bones! You long-legged beach-hound!" snarled Hamilton, fishing for his
  handkerchief to mop the hot Mocha from his white duck trousers.</p>

  <p>"He's coming. Ham!" gasped Bones. "Saw my letter, dear old sir, packed his
  jolly old grip, took the first train!..."</p>

  <p>Hamilton looked up sharply for symptoms of sunstroke.</p>

  <p>"Who is coming, you left-handed oaf?" he asked, between wrath and
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Haben, old sir... Under-Secretary, dear old Ham!" Bones was a little
  incoherent. "Saw my letter in the jolly old Star... he's at Administration
  now! This means a C.B. for me. Ham, old boy; but I'm not goin' to take
  anything unless they give old Ham the same&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Hamilton pointed sternly to a chair.</p>

  <p>"Sit down and finish your hysteria. Who has been stuffing you with this
  yarn?"</p>

  <p>It was the second officer of the Bassam, he who had brought ashore the
  mails. Haben was already at Administrative Headquarters, having travelled on
  the same ship. For the moment Hamilton forgot his coffee-stained ducks.</p>

  <p>"This is darned awkward," he said, troubled. "With Sanders up-country...
  what is he like, this Haben man?"</p>

  <p>Bones, for his own purpose, desired to give a flattering account of the
  visitor; he felt that a man who could respond so instantly to a newspaper
  invitation appearing over his name must have some good in him. He had asked
  same question of the second officer, and the second officer, with all a
  seaman's bluntness, had answered in two words, one of which was Rabelaisian
  and the other unprintable. For Mr. Haben did not shine in the eyes of his
  social inferiors. Servants hated him; his private secretaries came and went
  monthly. A horsey member of the Upper House summed him up when he said that
  "Haben can't carry corn."</p>

  <p>"Not so bad," said Bones mendaciously.</p>

  <p>Early the next morning Sergeant Ahmet Mahmed brought a grey pigeon to
  Hamilton, and the captain of Houssas wrote a message on a cigarette
  paper:</p>

  <p>Haben, Foreign Office tourist, en route. He is at A.H.Q. raising hell.
  Think you had better come back and deal with him.</p>

  <p>Hamilton had gone out in a surf-boat to interview the captain, and the
  character of Mr. Nickerson Haben was no longer a mystery to him.</p>

  <p>He fastened up the paper to the red leg of the pigeon and flung it up into
  the hot air.</p>

  <p>"'Ware hawks, little friend of soldiers," he said conventionally.</p>

  <p>Linked very closely with the life and fate of Mr. Nickerson Haben,
  Under-Secretary of State (this he did not dream), was that of Agasaka, the
  Chimbiri woman. Mr. Haben was dressed by the best tailor in Savile Row;
  Agasaka wore no clothes at all except for the kilt of dried grass which hung
  from her beautiful waist.</p>

  <p>A tall maiden, very slim of body and very grave of eyes, no lover for any
  man, having a great love for something more imponderable than man; terribly
  wise, too, in the ways of ghosts and devils; straight-backed, small-breasted,
  beloved of children, so strong in the arm and skilled in her strength that
  she could put a spear beyond the range of young men's throw&mdash;this was
  Agasaka, the Chimbiri woman, daughter of N'kema-n'kimi, the dead woodman.</p>

  <p>She was elderly for a virgin, being seventeen; had been wooed by men in
  their every mood; had kindness for all, generosity for none.</p>

  <p>She lived with her brother, M'suru, the hunting man; and his women hated
  her, for she never spoke a lie and was frank to her elderly brother on the
  matter of their numerous lovers. They would have beaten her, but that they
  knew the strength of her throwing arm. Where hands did not dare, tongues were
  more reckless, but none of their mud stuck. Few men were so poor in mind that
  they would admit others had succeeded where they had failed.</p>

  <p>She had lived for many years with her father in the deep of the forest in
  the abiding place of M'shima-M'shamba, the fearfully boisterous devil who
  tears up trees with each hand, whilst his mouth drips molten fire; and other
  mighty ones dwelt near by. N'guro, the headless dog, and Chikahika-m'bofunga,
  the eater of moons&mdash;indeed, all except the Fire Lizard, whose eyes talk
  death. And N'kema had taught her the mysteries of life and the beginning of
  life and the ground where life is sown. She knew men in their rawness and in
  their strength. N'kema taught her the way in which she might be more
  wonderful than any other woman; the magic handed down from mouth to
  mouth&mdash;the magic which was old when they laid the first deep stones of
  the Pyramids...</p>

  <p>Men were afraid of her; even Oboro, the witch-doctor, avoided her.</p>

  <p>For this was her strangest magic: that she had the power to bring before
  the eyes of men and women that which they desired least to see.</p>

  <p>Once, a small chief stalked her by the river path where the grass is
  chin-high, having certain plans with her. And at the right and lonely moment
  he slipped from cover, dropping his spears in the grass, and caught her by
  the arms so that, strong as she was, she could not move.</p>

  <p>"Agasaka," he said, "I have a hut in this forest that has never heard a
  woman's voice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He got so far and then, over her silken shoulder, he saw three black
  leopards walking flank by flank along the narrow path. Their heads hung low,
  their golden eyes shone hungrily.</p>

  <p>In an instant he released her and fled to his spears.</p>

  <p>When he turned again, leopards and woman were gone.</p>

  <p>Aliki, the huntsman of her village, neither feared nor cared, for he was
  familiar with magics of all kinds and often walked in the woods communing
  with devils. One night he saw a vision in the fire, a great red lizard that
  blinked its heavy eyelids. Aliki looked round his family circle in a
  cold-blooded search for a victim. Calichi, the fire lizard, is the most
  benevolent of devils and will accept a deputy for the man or woman to whom,
  with its red and blinking eyes, it has given its warning of death.</p>

  <p>This Aliki saw his three wives and his father and an uncle who had come
  many days' journey on a hunting trip and none of these, save the youngest
  wife, was well enough favoured for the purpose. Calichi is a fastidious
  devil; nothing short of the best and the most beautiful will please him.
  Beyond the group sitting about the red fire and eating from the big pot that
  stood in the embers, were other groups. The village street of Chimbiri-Isisi
  runs from the forest to the river, a broad avenue fringed with huts; and
  before each hut burnt a fire, and about each fire squatted the men and women
  of the house.</p>

  <p>Dark had come; above the tall gum trees the sky was encrusted with bright
  stars that winked and blinked as Calichi, but more rapidly.</p>

  <p>Aliki saw the stars, and rubbed his palms in the dust for luck; and at
  that moment into his vision came the second wife of his neighbour, a tall
  woman of eighteen, a nymph carved in mahogany, straight and supple of back,
  naked to the waistline of her grass skirt. And Aliki knew that he had found a
  proper substitute and said her name under his breath as he caught the
  lizard's eyes. Thereupon the beast faded and died away, and Aliki knew that
  the fire-god approved his choice.</p>

  <p>Later that night, when Loka, the wife of M'suru the huntsman, went down to
  the river to draw water for the first wife's needs, Aliki intercepted
  her.</p>

  <p>"There is nobody so beautiful as you, Loka," he said, "for you have the
  legs of a lion and the throat of a young deer."</p>

  <p>He enumerated other physical perfections, and Loka laughed and listened.
  She had quarrelled that day with the first wife of her husband, and M'suru
  had beaten her. She was terribly receptive to flattery and ripe for such
  adventure as women enjoy.</p>

  <p>"Have you no wives, Aliki?" she asked, pleased. "Now I will give you
  Agasaka, the sister of my husband, who is very beautiful and has never
  touched the shoulder of a man." This she said in spite, for she hated
  Agasaka, and it is a way of women to praise, to strangers, the qualities of
  the sisters they loathe.</p>

  <p>"As to Agasaka&mdash;and wives"&mdash;he made a gesture of
  contempt&mdash;"there is no such wife as you, not even in the hut of the old
  king beyond the mountains, which are the end of the world," said Aliki, and
  Loka laughed again.</p>

  <p>"Now I know that you are mad, as M'suru says. Also that you see strange
  sights which are not there to see," she said in her deep, sighing voice. "And
  not M'suru alone, but all men, say that you have the sickness mongo."</p>

  <p>It was true that Aliki was sick and had shooting pains in his head. He saw
  other things than lizards.</p>

  <p>"M'suru is an old man and a fool," he said. "I have a ju-ju who gives me
  eyes to see wonders. Come with me into the forest, Loka, and I will tell you
  magic and give you love such as an old man cannot give."</p>

  <p>She put down her gourd, hiding it in a patch of elephant grass near the
  river's edge, and walked behind him into the forest. There, eventually, he
  killed her. And he lit a fire and saw the lizard, who seemed satisfied. Aliki
  washed himself in the river and went back to his hut and to sleep.</p>

  <p>When he awoke in the morning he was sorry he had killed Loka, for of all
  the women in the world she had been most beautiful in his eyes. The village
  was half empty, for Loka's gourd had been found and trackers had gone into
  the woods searching for her. Her they found; but nobody had seen her walking
  to death. Some people thought she had been taken by Ochori fishermen, others
  favoured a devil notorious for his amorous tricks. They brought the body back
  along the village street, and all the married women made skirts of green
  leaves and stamped the Death Dance, singing strangely.</p>

  <p>Aliki, squatting before his fire, watched the procession with incurious
  eyes. He was sorry he had killed the Thing that was carried shoulder high,
  and, dropping his gaze to the dull fire, was even more sorry, for the hot
  lizard was leering up at him, his bulging eyelids winking at a great
  rate.</p>

  <p>So he had taken the wrong sacrifice.</p>

  <p>His eyes rose, rested on the slim figure of a woman, one hand gripping the
  door-post of her brother's hut. And there came to Aliki a tremendous
  conviction.</p>

  <p>The lizard had vanished from the heart of the fire when he looked
  down.</p>

  <p>No time was to be lost; he rose and went towards the virgin of
  Chimbiri.</p>

  <p>"I see you, Agasaka," he said. "Now this is a terrible shame to come to
  your brother's house, for men say that this woman Loka had a lover who killed
  her."</p>

  <p>She turned her big eyes slowly towards him. They were brown and filled
  with a marvellous luminosity that seemed to quiver as she looked.</p>

  <p>"Loka died because she was a fool," she said, "but he who killed her was a
  bigger. Her pain is past, his to come. Soon Sandi malaka will come, the brown
  butcher bird, and he will pick the eyes of the man who did this thing."</p>

  <p>Aliki hated her, but he was clever to nod his agreement.</p>

  <p>"I am wise, Agasaka," he said. "I see wonders which no man sees. Now
  before Sandi comes with his soldiers, I will show you a magic that will bring
  this wicked man to the door of your brother's hut when the moon is so and the
  river is so."</p>

  <p>Her grave eyes were on his; the sound of the singing women was a drone of
  sound at the far end of the village. A dog barked wheezily in the dark of the
  hut and all faces were turned towards the river where the body was being laid
  in a canoe before it was ferried to the little middle island where the dead
  lie in their shallow graves.</p>

  <p>"Let us go," she said, and walked behind him through an uneven field of
  maize, gained the shelter of the wood behind the village, and by awkward
  paths reached the outliers of the forest, where there was no maize, for this
  place was too sad for the weaver birds and too near to the habitation of man
  for the little monkeys who have white beards. Still he walked on until they
  made a patch of yellow flowers growing in a clearing. Here the trees were
  very high, and ten men might have stood on one another's heads against the
  smooth boles, and the topmost alone could have touched the lowermost
  branch.</p>

  <p>He stopped and turned. At that second came an uneasy stirring of the
  tree-tops, a cold wind and the rumbling of thunder.</p>

  <p>"Let us sit down," he said. "First I will talk to you of women who loved
  me, and of how I would not walk before them because of my great thoughts for
  you. Then we will be lovers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is no magic in that, Aliki," she said, and he saw that she was
  against him and lifted his spear.</p>

  <p>"You die, as Loka died, because of the word which the lizard of fire
  brought to me," he said, and his shoulder hunched back for the throw.</p>

  <p>"I am Loka!" said the girl, and he looked and his jaw dropped. For she was
  truly Loka, the woman he had killed. Loka with her sly eyes and long fingers.
  And she had Loka's way of putting a red flower behind her ear, and Loka's
  long, satiny legs.</p>

  <p>"Oh, ko!" he said in distress, and dropped his spear. Agasaka bent in the
  middle and picked it up, and in that moment became herself again. There was
  no flower and her fingers were shorter, and where the sly smile had been, was
  the gravity of death.</p>

  <p>"This is my magic," she said. "Now walk before me, Aliki, killer of Loka,
  for I am not made for love, but for strange power."</p>

  <p>Without a word the bemused man walked back the way he had come and Agasaka
  followed, and, following, felt the edge of the spear's broad blade. Though
  she touched lightly, there was a line of blood on her thumb where blade and
  skin had met. The wood was growing dark, the wind was alternately a shriek
  and a whimper of sound. Near the pool at the edge of the forest she swung the
  spear backward over her left shoulder as a cavalry soldier would swing his
  sword, and he half turned at the sound of the whistle it made...</p>

  <p>The first wife of her brother was by the pool gathering manioc root from a
  place where it had been left to soak&mdash;the head of Aliki fell at her feet
  as the first flash of lightning lit the gloom of the world.</p>

  <p>The sun was four hours old when a river gunboat, a white and glittering
  thing, came round the bluff which is called The Fish because of its shape.
  The black waters of the river were piled up around its bows, a glassy hillock
  of water, tinged red at its edges, for the Zaire was driving against a
  six-knot current. Every river from the Isisi to the Mokalibi was in spate,
  and there were sand shoals where deeps had been, and deeps in the places
  where the crocodiles had slept open-mouthed the last time Mr. Commissioner
  Sanders had come that way.</p>

  <p>He stood by the steersman, a slim and dapper figure in spotless white, his
  pith helmet at a rakish angle, for an elephant fly had bitten him on the
  forehead the night before, and the lump it had induced was painful to the
  touch. Between his regular, white teeth was a long, black cheroot. He had
  breakfasted, and an orderly was clearing away the silver coffee-pot and the
  fruit-plates. Overhead the sky was a burning blue, but the glass was falling
  with alarming rapidity, and he desired the safe harbourage of a deep bank and
  the shelter of high trees which a little bay south of Chimbiri would give to
  him.</p>

  <p>"Lo'ba, ko'lo ka! A fathom of water by the mercy of God!"</p>

  <p>The sleepy-eyed boy sitting in the bow of the boat drew up his wet
  sounding-rod.</p>

  <p>Sanders's hand shot out to the handle of the telegraph and pulled, and
  Yoka the engineer sent a clanging acknowledgment.</p>

  <p>"Half a fathom."</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>The boat slowed of itself, its wheel threshing astern, but the nose was in
  sand and a side-swinging current drove the stern round until it was broadside
  to the sand-reef. Then, as the wheel reversed, the Zaire began to move
  towards the right bank of the river, skirting the shoal until the nose found
  deep water again.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the steersman, virtuously annoyed, "this bank has come up
  from hell, for it has never been here since I was without clothing."</p>

  <p>"Think only of the river, man," said Sanders, not inclined for gossip.</p>

  <p>And now, above the tree-tops ahead, Sanders saw the roiling smoke of
  clouds&mdash;yellow clouds that tumbled and tossed and threw out tawny
  banners before the wind.</p>

  <p>And the still surface of the river was ripped into little white shreds
  that leapt and scattered in spray. Sanders moved his cigar from one side of
  his mouth to the other, took it out, looked at it regretfully and threw it
  over the side. His servant was behind him with an oilskin invitingly held; he
  struggled into the coat, passed his helmet back and took in exchange the
  sou'wester, which he fastened under his chin. The heat was intolerable. The
  storm was driving a furnace blast of hot air to herald its fury. He was wet
  to the skin, his clothes sticking to him.</p>

  <p>A ribbon of blinding light leapt across the sky, and split into a tracery
  of branches. The explosion of the thunder was deafening; it seemed as if a
  heavy weight was pressing down on his head; again the flash, and again and
  again. Now it showed bluely on either bank, vivid blue shrieks of light that
  ran jaggedly from sky to earth. The yellow clouds had become black; the
  darkness of night was on the world, a darkness intensified by the ghastly
  sideways light that came from a distant horizon where the clouds were
  broken.</p>

  <p>"Port," said Sanders curtly; "now starboard again&mdash;now port!"</p>

  <p>They had reached the shelter of the bank as the first rain fell. Sanders
  sent a dozen men overboard with the fore and aft hawser and made fast to the
  big gums that grew down to the river-side.</p>

  <p>In a second the deck was running with water and the Commissioner's white
  shoes had turned first to dove-grey and then to slate. He sent for Yoka the
  engineer, who was also his headman.</p>

  <p>"Put out another hawser and keep a full head of steam." He spoke in coast
  Arabic, which is a language allowing of nice distinctions.</p>

  <p>"Lord, shall I sound the oopa-oopa*" he asked. "For I see that these
  thieving Akasava people are afraid to come out into the rain to welcome your
  lordship."</p>

  <p>[*Siren. On the river most words describing novel things are
  onomatopoeic.]</p>

  <p>Sanders shook his head.</p>

  <p>"They will come in their time&mdash;the village is a mile away, and they
  would not hear your oopa-oopa!" he said, and went to his cabin to recover his
  breath. A ninety-knot wind had been blowing into his teeth for ten minutes,
  and ten minutes is a long time when you are trying to breathe.</p>

  <p>The cabin had two long windows, one at each side. That to the left above
  the settee on which he dropped gave him a view of the forest path along
  which, sooner or later, a villager would come and inevitably carry a message
  to the chief.</p>

  <p>The lightning was still incessant; the rain came down in such a volume
  that he might well think he had anchored beneath a small waterfall, but the
  light had changed, and ahead the black of clouds had become a grey
  opacity.</p>

  <p>Sanders pulled open the doors he had closed behind him; the wind was gusty
  but weaker. He reached out for a cheroot and lit it, patient to wait. The
  river was running eight knots; he would need hand-towing to the beach of the
  village. He hoped they had stacked wood for him. The Chimbiri folk were lazy,
  and the last time he had tied they showed him a wood stack&mdash;green logs,
  and few of them.</p>

  <p>Yoka and his crew loved to hear the devil whoop of the oopa-oopa
  &mdash;Sanders knew just how much steam a siren wasted.</p>

  <p>His eyes sought the river-side path&mdash;and at the critical moment. For
  he saw eight men walking two and two, and they carried on their shoulders a
  trussed figure.</p>

  <p>An electric chrysanthemum burst into blinding bloom as he leapt to the
  bank&mdash;its dazzling petals, twisting every way through the dark clouds,
  made light enough to see the burden very clearly, long before he reached the
  path to stand squarely in the way of eight sullen men and the riff-raff which
  had defied the storm to follow at a distance.</p>

  <p>"O men," said Sanders softly&mdash;he showed his teeth when he talked that
  way&mdash;"who are you that you put the ghost mark on this woman's face?"</p>

  <p>For the face of their passenger was daubed white with clay. None spoke: he
  saw their toes wriggling, all save those of one man, and him he
  addressed.</p>

  <p>"M'suru, son of N'kema, what woman is this?"</p>

  <p>M'suru cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"Lord, this woman is the daughter of my own mother; she killed Aliki, also
  she killed first my wife Loka."</p>

  <p>"Who saw this?"</p>

  <p>"Master, my first wife, who is a true woman to me since her lover was
  drowned, she saw the head of Aliki fall. Also she heard Agasaka say 'Go, man,
  where I sent Loka, as you know best, who saw me slay her.'"</p>

  <p>Sanders was not impressed.</p>

  <p>"Let loose this woman that she may stand in my eyes," he said, and they
  untied the girl and by his order wiped the joke of death from her face.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," said Sanders.</p>

  <p>She spoke very simply and her story was good. Yet&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Bring me the woman who heard her say these evil things."</p>

  <p>The wife was found in the tail of the procession and came forward
  important&mdash;frightened&mdash;for the cold eyes of Sanders were unnerving.
  But she was voluble when she had discovered her voice.</p>

  <p>The man in the streaming oilskins listened, his head bent. Agasaka, the
  slim woman, stood grave, unconscious of shame&mdash;the grass girdle had gone
  and she was as her mother had first seen her. Presently the first wife came
  to the end of her story.</p>

  <p>"Sandi, this is the truth, and if I speak a lie may the 'long ones' take
  me to the bottom of the river and feed me to the snakes!"</p>

  <p>Sanders, watching her, saw the brown skin go dull and grey; saw the mouth
  open in shocking fear.</p>

  <p>What he did not see was the "long one"&mdash;the yellow crocodile that was
  creeping through the grass towards the perjurer, his little eyes gleaming,
  his wet mouth open to show the cruel white spikes of teeth.</p>

  <p>Only the first wife of M'suru saw this, and fell screaming and writhing at
  her husband's feet, clasping his knees.</p>

  <p>Sanders said nothing, but heard much that was in contradiction of the
  earlier story.</p>

  <p>"Come with me, Agasaka, to my fine ship," he said, for he knew that
  trouble might follow if the girl stayed with her people. Wars have started
  for less cause.</p>

  <p>He took her to the Zaire; she followed meekly at his heels, though
  meekness was not in her.</p>

  <p>That night came a tired pigeon from Headquarters, and Sanders, reading the
  message, was neither pleased nor sorry.</p>

  <p>High officials, especially the armchair men, worried him a little, but
  those he had met were such charming and understanding gentlemen that he had
  lost some of his fear of them. What worried him more were the reports which
  reached him from reliable sources of Agasaka's strange powers. He had seen
  many queer things on the river; the wonder of the lokali, that hollowed
  tree-trunk by which messages might be relayed across a continent, was still
  something of a puzzle to him. Magic inexplicable, some times revolting, was
  an everyday phenomenon. Some of it was crude hypnotism, but there were higher
  things beyond his understanding Many of these had come down through the ages
  from Egypt and beyond; Abraham had brought practices from the desert lands
  about Babylon which were religious rites amongst people who had no written
  language.</p>

  <p>The Zaire was steaming for home the next day when he sent for Abiboo, his
  orderly.</p>

  <p>"Bring me this woman of Chimbiri," he said, and they brought her from the
  little store-cabin where she was both guest and prisoner.</p>

  <p>"They tell me this and that about you, Agasaka," he said, giving chapter
  and verse of his authority.</p>

  <p>"Lord, it is true," said Agasaka when he had finished. "These things my
  father taught me, as his father taught him. For, lord, he was the son of
  M'kufusu, the son of Bonfongu-m'lini, the son of N'sambi..."</p>

  <p>She recited thirty generations before he stopped her&mdash;roughly four
  hundred years. Even Sanders was staggered, though he had once met an old man
  of the N'gombi who told him intimate details about a man who had lived in the
  days of Saladin.</p>

  <p>"Show me your magic, woman," he said, and to his surprise she shook her
  head.</p>

  <p>"Lord, this one magic only comes when I am afraid."</p>

  <p>Sanders dropped his hand to his Browning and half drew it from its leather
  holster.</p>

  <p>He was sitting under an awning spread over the bridge. The steersman was
  at the wheel, in the bow the kano boy with his long sounding-rod. Purposely
  he did not look at the woman, fixing his eyes on the steersman's back.</p>

  <p>His hand had scarcely closed on the brown grip when, almost at his feet,
  he saw the one thing in all the world that he loathed&mdash;an English
  puff-adder, mottled and swollen, its head thrown back to strike.</p>

  <p>Twice his pistol banged&mdash;the steersman skipped to cover with a yell
  and left the Zaire yawing in the strong current.</p>

  <p>There was nothing&mdash;nothing but two little holes in the deck, so close
  together that they overlapped. Sanders sprang to the wheel and straightened
  the boat, and then, when the steersman had been called back and the sounding
  boy retrieved from the cover of the wood pile where he crouched and trembled,
  Sanders returned to his chair, waving away Abiboo, who had arrived, rifle in
  hand, to the rescue of his master.</p>

  <p>"Woman," said Sanders quietly, "you may go back to your little house."</p>

  <p>And Agasaka went without the evidence of triumph a lesser woman might have
  felt. He had not looked at her&mdash;there was no mesmerism here.</p>

  <p>He stooped down and examined the bullet holes, too troubled to feel
  foolish.</p>

  <p>That afternoon he sent for her again and gave her chocolate to eat,
  talking of her father. She was sitting on the deck at his feet, and once,
  when he thought he had gained her confidence, he dropped his hand lightly on
  her head as he had dropped his hand on so many young heads.</p>

  <p>The puff-adder was there&mdash;within striking distance, his spade head
  thrown back, his coils rigid.</p>

  <p>Sanders stared at the thing and did not move his hand, and then, through
  the shining body, he saw the deck planks, and the soft bitumen where plank
  joined plank, and then the viper vanished.</p>

  <p>"You do not fear?" he asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"Lord... a little; but now I do not fear, for I know that you would not
  hurt women."</p>

  <p>The Zaire, with its strange passenger, came alongside the residency wharf
  two hours before sundown on the third day. Captain Hamilton was waiting, a
  fuming, angry man, for he had been the unwilling host of one who lacked
  something in manners.</p>

  <p>"He's pure swine," said Hamilton. "Nothing is good enough for him; he
  raised hell when he found you weren't here to meet him. Bones mollified him a
  little. The silly ass had a guard of honour drawn up on the beach. I only
  found this out just before the boat landed, and it was too late to send the
  men to quarters. But apparently it was the right thing to do; Nickerson
  Esquire expected it&mdash;and more. Flags and things and a red carpet for his
  hooves and a band to play 'Here comes the bride!'"</p>

  <p>All this between wharf and residency garden. A figure in white stretched
  languidly in a deep chair turned his head but did not trouble to rise. Still
  less was he inclined to exchange the cool of the broad veranda for the
  furnace of space open to a red-hot sun.</p>

  <p>Sanders saw a white face that looked oddly dirty in contrast with the
  spotless purity of a duck jacket. Two deep, suspicious eyes, a long, untidy
  wisp of hair lying lankly on a high forehead&mdash;a pink, almost bloodless
  mouth.</p>

  <p>"You're Sanders?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Haben looked up at the trim figure.</p>

  <p>"I am the Commissioner, sir," said Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Why weren't you here to meet me; you knew that I was due?"</p>

  <p>Sanders was more shocked than nettled by the tone. A coarse word in the
  mouth of a woman would have produced the same effect. Secretaries and
  Under-Secretaries of State were god-like people who employed a macrology of
  their own, wrapping their reproofs in the silver tissue of stilted diction
  which dulled the sting of their rebukes.</p>

  <p>"Do you hear me, sir?"</p>

  <p>The man on the chair sat up impatiently.</p>

  <p>Hamilton, standing by, was near to kicking him off the stoep.</p>

  <p>"I heard you. I was on a visit to the Chimbiri country. No notice of your
  arrival or your pending arrival was received."</p>

  <p>Sanders spoke very carefully; he was staring down at the scowling
  Nickerson.</p>

  <p>Mr. Haben had it on the tip of his tongue to give him the lie. There was,
  as the late Mrs. Haben had said, a streak of commonness in him; but there was
  a broader streak of discretion. The gun still hung at the Commissioner's hip;
  the grip was shiny with use.</p>

  <p>"H'm!" said Mr. Under-Secretary Haben, and allowed himself to relax in his
  chair.</p>

  <p>He was clever enough, Sanders found; knew the inside story of the
  Territories; was keen for information. He thought the country was not well
  run. The system was wrong, the taxes fell short of the highest possible
  index. In all ways his attitude was antagonistic. Commissioners were lazy
  people, intent on having a good time and "their shooting." Sanders, who had
  never shot a wild beast in his life, save for the pot or to rid himself of a
  pressing danger, said nothing.</p>

  <p>"A thoroughly nasty fellow," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>But it was Bones who suffered the heaviest casualty to his
  <i>amour-propre</i>.</p>

  <p>Left alone with the visitor in the hour before dinner, Bones cunningly led
  the conversation towards the Surrey Star and Middlesex Plain Dealer.</p>

  <p>"I suppose, sir, when you read my jolly old letter, you thought I had a
  fearful nerve?"</p>

  <p>"Your letter?" Mr. Haben allowed his head to fall in Bones's
  direction.</p>

  <p>"... about seeing the place with your own holy old eyes," and Bones went
  on, unconscious of the doom which awaited him, and explained fully his reason
  for writing, the thought that led him to, write, the incident that induced
  the thought.</p>

  <p>"My good young man, you don't imagine that His Majesty's Government would
  send a Minister of State flying off to Africa because an empty-headed
  subaltern wrote letters to an obscure county journal, do you?"</p>

  <p>Bones opened and closed his eyes very quickly.</p>

  <p>"I came&mdash;but why should I tell you?" asked Nickerson Haben wearily.
  "You may be assured that your letter had nothing to do with my coming. As I
  said before, you officers have too much time on your hands. It is a matter
  which requires looking into."</p>

  <p>But it was at dinner that he touched the zenith of his boorishness. The
  dinner was bad; he hated palm-nut chop; sweet potatoes made him ill; the
  chicken was tough, the coffee vile. Happily he had brought his own
  cigars.</p>

  <p>Bones spent that trying hour wondering what would happen to him if he
  leant across the table and batted an Under-Secretary with a cut-glass
  salt-cellar.</p>

  <p>Only Sanders showed no sign of annoyance. Not a muscle of his face moved
  when Mr. Nickerson Haben made the most unforgivable of all suggestions. He
  did this out of sheer ignorance and because of that streak of commonness
  which was his very own.</p>

  <p>"A native woman is a native woman," said Sanders quietly. "Happily, I have
  only had gentlemen under my control, and that complication has never
  arisen."</p>

  <p>Mr. Haben smiled sceptically; he was sourest when he smiled.</p>

  <p>"Very noble," he said dryly, "and yet one has heard of such things
  happening."</p>

  <p>Hamilton was white with rage. Bones stared open-mouthed, like a boy who
  only dimly understood. The pale man asked a question and, to the amazement of
  the others, Sanders nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I brought a girl down from Chimbiri," he said; "she is at present in
  the Houssa lines with the wife of Sergeant Abiboo. I hardly know what to do
  with her."</p>

  <p>"I suppose not," more dryly yet. "A prisoner, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"N&mdash;no"&mdash;Sanders hesitated&mdash;seemed confused in Haben's
  eyes. "She has a peculiar brand of magic which rather confounds
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Here Mr. Nickerson Haben laughed.</p>

  <p>"That stuff!" he said contemptuously. "Let me see your magician."</p>

  <p>Bones was sent to fetch her&mdash;he swore loudly all the way across the
  dark square.</p>

  <p>"That is what we complain about," said Mr. Haben in the time of waiting.
  "You fellows are in the country so long that you get niggerised." (Sanders
  winced. "Nigger" is a word you do not use in Africa.) "You absorb their
  philosophies and superstitions. Magic&mdash;good God!"</p>

  <p>He waggled his long head hopelessly.</p>

  <p>"My poor wife believed in the same rubbish&mdash;she came from one of the
  Southern states&mdash;had a black mammy who did wonderful things with chicken
  bones!"</p>

  <p>Sanders had not credited him with a wife. When he learnt that the poor
  lady had died he felt that worse things could happen to a woman.</p>

  <p>"Appendicitis&mdash;an operation... fool of a doctor." Mr. Haben unbent so
  far as to scatter these personal items. "As I said before, you
  people&mdash;hum..."</p>

  <p>Agasaka stood in the doorway, "missionary dressed" as they say. Her figure
  was concealed in a blue cotton "cloth" wrapped and pinned about her to the
  height of her breast.</p>

  <p>"This is the lady, eh? Come here!" He beckoned her and she came to him.
  "Let us see her magic... speak to her!"</p>

  <p>Sanders nodded.</p>

  <p>"This man wishes to see your magic, Agasaka; he is a great chief amongst
  my people."</p>

  <p>She did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Not bad-looking," said Nickerson, and did a thing which amazed these men,
  for he rose and, putting his hand under her chin, raised her face to his. And
  there was something in his queer, hard eyes that she read, as we may read the
  printed word. The streak of commonness was abominably broad and
  raw-edged.</p>

  <p>"You're not so bad for a nig..."</p>

  <p>He dropped his hands suddenly; they saw his face pucker hideously. He was
  looking at a woman, a handsome woman with deep shadows under her eyes. It was
  the face he often saw and always tried to forget. A dead white face. She wore
  a silk nightdress, rather high to the throat...</p>

  <p>And she spoke.</p>

  <p>"Won't you wait until the nurse comes back, Nick? I don't think I ought to
  drink ice-water&mdash;the doctor.."</p>

  <p>"Damn the doctor!" said Nickerson Haben between his teeth, and the three
  men heard him, saw his hand go up holding an imaginary glass, saw his eyes
  fall to the level of an imaginary pillow.</p>

  <p>"I'm sick of you&mdash;sick of you! Make a new will, eh? Like hell!"</p>

  <p>He stared and stared, and then slowly turned his drawn face to
  Sanders.</p>

  <p>"My wife"&mdash;he pointed to space and mumbled the words&mdash;
  "I&mdash;I killed her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And then he realised that he was Nickerson Haben, Under-Secretary of
  State, and these were three very unimportant officials&mdash;and a black
  woman who was regarding him gravely. But this discovery of his was just the
  flash of a second too late.</p>

  <p>"Go to your room, sir," said Sanders, and spent the greater part of the
  night composing a letter to the Foreign Secretary.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap02"
     id="chap02">II. &mdash; THE CLEAN SWEEPER</a></h2>

  <h3>First published as "Bones and the Magic Music" in <i>The Grand
  Magazine</i>, Vol. 47, Mar-Aug 1925</h3>

  <p class="first">THE soldiers of the old king who lives beyond the mountains
  came down into the Ochori country and took back with them ten women and forty
  goats&mdash;and this was the year of the sickness, when goats were very
  valuable. And a week later they came again, and in yet another week they
  repeated the raid.</p>

  <p>Mr. Commissioner Sanders sent an urgent message into the old king's
  country and journeyed to the Ochori to meet the old man's envoy...</p>

  <p>On a certain day, over the northern hills came Buliki, chief minister of
  the great king K'salugu-M'pobo, and he came with great hauteur, with four and
  sixty spearmen for his escort, and each spearman wore the leopard skin of the
  royal service&mdash;that is to say, a leopard skin with three monkey tails,
  signifying the swiftness, the ferocity and the agility of these men. He
  boasted that he was the fortieth of his house who had sat in the royal kraal
  and had given the law.</p>

  <p>Sanders, with a more modest escort, waited in the city of the Ochori for
  the coming of this mission, which was two days late and was even now
  arriving, not at dawn as had been faithfully promised, but in the heat of the
  day. Sanders sat cross-legged on his canvas chair, chewing an unsmoked cigar
  and drawing little patterns with his ebony stick on the sand.</p>

  <p>Behind him, tall and straight, his bare, brown back rippling with muscles
  with every movement, was Bosambo, chief and king of the Ochori folk north and
  south.</p>

  <p>Behind the shelter which had been erected to serve as a palaver house was
  a section of Houssas, brownfaced men in blue tunics, handling their rifles
  with an easy familiarity which was very awe-inspiring to the dense mob of the
  Ochori people who had come to witness this memorable meeting.</p>

  <p>Sanders said no word, realising that this was not the moment for
  confidences, and that in all probability Bosambo was quite as wise as he
  himself on the matter of the great king's delinquencies. For north of the
  hills was territory which was as yet independent, and acknowledged no
  government and no king beside its own.</p>

  <p>Whether this was to remain so did not depend entirely upon the result of
  the interview, for no man knew better than Sanders that nothing short of four
  battalions could force the passes of the great mountains, and war was very
  unpopular with the British Government just about then.</p>

  <p>The royal guard which the king had sent as escort to his minister wheeled
  on to the big square and formed a line facing Sanders, and the Houssas
  regarded them with the peculiar interest which soldiers have for possible
  casualties. Buliki was a big man, broad, tall and stout. He swaggered up to
  the palaver house without any evidence that he was impressed by the
  importance of the man he was to meet.</p>

  <p>"I see you, white man," he said in the Bomongo tongue, which runs for six
  hundred miles to the north and the west of the Territories.</p>

  <p>"I see you, black man," replied Sanders. "What message do you bring from
  your master?"</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the man insolently, "my master has no message for you, only
  this: that whilst he rules his land he knows no other king than his own
  beautiful impulse and has no other law but the law he gives."</p>

  <p>"Oh, ko'." said Sanders sardonically. "He must have a very powerful ju-ju
  to talk so boldly, and you, Buliki, have surely the stomach of a
  lion&mdash;for hereabouts I am the law, and men who speak to me in the tone
  of a master I hang out of hand."</p>

  <p>His tone was bleak and cold, and his blue eyes strayed unconsciously to
  the high tree before the palaver place.</p>

  <p>Buliki, who knew nothing of the sacred character of an embassy, went grey
  under his tawny skin and shuffled his feet.</p>

  <p>"Lord," he pleaded, in a different voice, "I am a tired man, having come
  this day across the Mountain of the Cold White Powder that Melts. Therefore
  be gentle to me, a poor chief, who does not know the ways of white men."</p>

  <p>"Go back to your master, Buliki, and speak this way: Sandi, who sits for
  his king on the great river, desires that no soldiers may come again from the
  king's territory to raid the women and goats of the Ochori. For I am a man
  quick to kill, and no respecter of kings or chiefs. I have ploughed little
  kings into the ground and the crops of my people have flourished on the bones
  of princes. Where is M'balogini, who brought his spears against me? He is
  dead and his house has rotted with the rains. Where is Kobolo, the N'gombi
  warrior who took his young men into battle against me? You will search the
  forest for his city, and his spirit weeps on the great mountain. Little kings
  are my meat: how mighty are they in the house of their wives! How small are
  they when I bring them in irons to my great ship! Go back to the old king and
  say this: The chief or soldier of his who comes this side of the Ghost
  Mountains shall be slaves for my people and be glad they are alive. The
  palaver is finished."</p>

  <p>After the embassy had departed...</p>

  <p>"Dam' nigger!" said Bosambo, who was blacker than a spade suit but had the
  advantage of a Christian education. "Silly ass!..."</p>

  <p>Then, in his own language, for Sanders did not favour Coast English:
  "Lord, this old king is very cunning, and there sits in the shadow of his hut
  a white man who knows the ways of white lords."</p>

  <p>"The devil there is!" said Sanders in surprise, for this was news to him,
  that Joe had gone that way.</p>

  <p>Up in the old king's country Buliki, prostrate and on his face before the
  wizened old man, told the story of his embassy, and the king listened,
  stroking his thin, frizzly beard.</p>

  <p>Joe the Trader (he had no other name) listened too, and had parts of the
  message translated to him.</p>

  <p>"Tell the old man," he said to his interpreter, "that all that stuff is
  bunk! Say, Sanders ain't got no soldiers more'n fifty! Tell him that if he
  sends down to headquarters an' complains 'bout these threats, Sanders'll get
  it in the neck&mdash;not allowed to do that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>Joe, in his semi-sober moments, was an authority on what may be described
  as the unwritten laws of the wild. He had tramped up and down Africa from the
  Zambesi to the Lado, and he had learnt a lot. There wasn't a lock-up from
  Charter to Dakka that had not housed him. He had traded arms and gin for
  ivory in the days of Bula Matadi, and had drifted now to the one sanctuary
  where the right arm of any law could not reach him.</p>

  <p>Of all the men in the world he hated best Mr. Sanders. He had good reason
  for his antipathy, for Sanders flogged the sellers of gin, and hanged even
  white gentlemen who purveyed Belgian firearms to the unsophisticated and
  bloodthirsty aborigines.</p>

  <p>"Here!..." Joe was excited at the idea. "Tell him to send for Sanders to a
  great palaver&mdash;somewhere up the Ghosts&mdash;you'd get him coming up
  that road..."</p>

  <p>This plan was duly translated. The old king's dull eyes lit up and he
  rubbed his hands, for he had sworn to stretch upon his new war-drum the skin
  of the man who harassed him&mdash;and the drum's case had grown warped and
  cracked in the years of waiting.</p>

  <p>"That is good talk," said a counsellor unfavourable to the king's white
  guest; "but it is well known that Sandi goes unharmed through terrible
  dangers because of M'shimba-M'shamba, the fearful spirit. They say that great
  regiments of devils march with him shrieking so that, where he has passed,
  the leopards lie dead with fright."</p>

  <p>The old king was impressed, and licked the four fingers of his right hand
  so that no evil could touch him.</p>

  <p>"Stuff!" said Joe loudly. "Ghosts&mdash;stuff! You'll get him good an'
  then these birds won't come stickin' their noses over the mountains no
  more..."</p>

  <p>The king listened, straining his neck towards the interpreter.</p>

  <p>"Man, this shall be," he said, and Buliki was bidden to rise.</p>

  <p>Just as the years of Old Egypt found themselves identified with the
  transient periods of kings, so was there a chronology of the river which has
  its significant association with a certain Lieutenant Tibbetts of the King's
  Houssas. Up at Headquarters, the heads of little departments still speak of
  the Second Year of Bones as marking the process of a dynasty.</p>

  <p>It was an annus mirabilis from causes which, in the main, had nothing
  whatever to do with Bones, as Hamilton of the Houssas had christened this
  lank subaltern.</p>

  <p>Nor had it to do with the wonders which he worked by land and flood. Nor,
  exactly and truthfully, could it be said that he had any notable influence on
  the fecund soil which that year produced the most amazing of all harvests.
  Nor did he cause the river to overflow its banks (as it did) and wipe out
  thirty-five fishing villages and bring crocodiles ten miles into the forest
  where they fought in a beastly fashion with leopards and buffaloes.</p>

  <p>Nor, and this must be placed to his credit and widely advertised, was he
  in the least degree responsible for the presence and personality of one who
  was flippantly described as "Lords."</p>

  <p>New brooms may not always sweep clean, but, generally speaking, they raise
  enough dust to choke some men and bring tears to the eyes of others.
  Macalister Campbell-Cairns was the newest broom that was ever landed from a
  surf-boat to agitate the fever-bitten back-blocks, and bring to the surface
  the murder urge which lies so close to the skin of the most law-abiding.</p>

  <p>This man was an Excellency, had on the lapel of his coat miniature noughts
  and crosses that glittered at the end of variegated ribbons; wore, as his
  right on such occasions, a radiant paste star over his pancreas, and could
  put a string of letters after his name as long as the name itself. He fell
  from the surf-boat into the arms of a sergeant of King's Houssas, fell from
  the tawdry little horse carriage which brought turn to Government House, into
  the presence of a second and third secretary, a Chief Staff Officer, and the
  Master of his Household; and eventually fell into the thickly padded chair
  which was his by right of his high office. And almost immediately the new
  broom began to move around the dusty places, and there was issued from
  Administrative Headquarters an Order of the Day which was, to all intents and
  purposes, an Address of Welcome to Sir Macalister Campbell-Cairns, written by
  Sir Macalister Campbell-Cairns and signed in his indecipherable hand. He had
  come (he said) to bring Light into Dark Places; to do justice to white and
  black alike; to offer an Inspiration and a Hope to the most Debased; to
  establish Centralisation and curb the undesirable tendencies of officials to
  usurp the functions of the Law. (He did not exactly say this, but he meant
  this.) And last, but not least, he Intended Making Himself Acquainted with
  every Frontier Post of Civilisation for which he was responsible. And if
  anybody had grievances would they kindly keep them until he came along.</p>

  <p>"O my God!" gasped thirty-three Commissioners, Inspectors, Officers
  Commanding troops and the like when this reached them.</p>

  <p>Attached to the address of welcome was a "Very Secret and Highly
  Confidential" note for the more important of his subordinates.</p>

  <p>It has been brought to the Administrator's attention that judgment of
  death is frequently given and executed by subordinate officials, particularly
  in the Reserved Territories. This practice must cease. All inquiries into
  cases of murder, treason, and incitement to rebellion must be remitted to
  A.H.Q., accompanied by a report of the evidence in triplicate, depositions
  (in duplicate) and of report of the findings of the court.</p>

  <p>A month after this order was issued. Lieutenant Tibbetts, whose other name
  was Bones, chased a man who had murdered N'kema, the woodman, and stolen his
  wife, caught him on the borders of the old king's country, and hanged him
  within an hour of his arrest.</p>

  <p>Thereupon was Hell let Loose at Administrative Headquarters, and the
  musical career of Lieutenant Tibbetts was threatened with extinguishment.</p>

  <p>Adolescence is a disorder which is marked by well-defined periods of
  fevers and flushings, shiverings of body and whizzings of head. Peculiar and
  symptomatic of these phases are strange cravings and aberrations, and a
  certain eccentric choice in the matter of condiment. For the bread of youth
  is better enjoyed when flavoured with an opsonium which is indigestible and
  even repulsive to the more educated taste.</p>

  <p>The child who does not fix wistful eyes upon the cab of a railway engine
  is scarcely normal, the youth who has not envied the conductors of orchestras
  is hardly human. The young man who wishes that he could sit down at a piano
  and with an air of nonchalance run his fingers along the keys and dash
  straight away into the most complicated of musical compositions, has
  something wrong with him.</p>

  <p>Bones had come to a state of development when he most passionately desired
  to make music. He had a portable harmonium in the corner of his hut and a
  viola under his bed. He could tell almost at a glance the difference between
  B flat and F sharp on any printed sheet. He had a small library on the Theory
  of Music, every book bound in royal blue with his monogram in gold on the
  covers. A trap drummer's outfit occupied a table usually and more properly
  reserved for the study of Cleary's Tactics and the Manual of Military
  Law.</p>

  <p>Bones started his infamous musical career by the purchase of a
  clarinet&mdash;a long thing of wood and glittering metal. He bought this, as
  he bought most unnecessary things, because in the pages of his favourite
  magazine he had read an advertisement which told him to:</p>

  <p>Learn to Play the Clarinet. Was Clerk, now Leader of Tawoomba Silver Band.
  Learning Clarinet Made This Man Owner of His Own House and Put $10,000.00
  into Farmers Bank.</p>

  <p>"This man's" portrait was given to prove the bona fides of the claim.
  Bones thought $10,000.00 was ten millions, and sent 25 dollars by the next
  mail. He could never resist these bullying advertisements that order you to
  "fill in that coupon and send your money right away.".</p>

  <p>"I've got a soft heart, dear old officer," he apologised for the clarinet
  when eventually it came. "It's like drink to me, dear old captain. The minute
  I see one of those dashed old coupons I've got to sign it. I'm easily led,
  dear sir and brother officer&mdash;you can't drive old Bones. You can lead
  him but you can't drive him. That sort of thing runs in the family."</p>

  <p>"Weak-minded?" suggested Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Not weak-minded&mdash;naughty, naughty!" Bones was waggishly
  reproachful.</p>

  <p>"The point is this. Bones"&mdash;Captain Hamilton swung round in his chair
  and his eye was cold, his manner distinctly unfriendly&mdash;"I'm not going
  to allow you to learn to play that infernal instrument within five miles of
  the Residency."</p>

  <p>"Ham, old sir," said Bones gently, "are you being just, dear old sir
  &mdash;justice, Ham, old superior, as jolly old Shakespeare says, blesses him
  or she who gives and him or she who takes."</p>

  <p>Hamilton often blamed himself for his weakness in the matter of the
  clarinet. He should have put Bones under arrest or poisoned him or
  something.</p>

  <p>Bones's love of music grew with what it fed upon. The harmonium was not a
  nuisance until he brought it into the open one warm night and played to 120
  fascinated soldiers of the King's Houssas, their innumerable wives and
  progeny. The handbells (which marked the next stage of the disease) were a
  curse: twice Hamilton sprinted to the Residency, thinking he was late for
  lunch, only to discover that Bones was practising "Ring Out Wild Bells." Once
  the whole camp was turned out at midnight to catch Alt Ahmet's pet chimpanzee
  who had broken his chain and gone on a foraging expedition. It took three,
  days to get him down from the high copal tree to which he had retired with a
  G major bell in one hand and the C sharp in the other, ringing them
  alternately day and night, with an expression of misery that was
  heart-breaking to witness.</p>

  <p>The cornet which Bones had on approval from a trader at Sierra Leone was
  sent back by Sanders's orders as being demoralising to the armed forces of
  the Crown, for the first notes (as Bones played them) of "A Sailor's Life" so
  closely resembled the "Alarm and Assembly" call that headquarters was a
  constant ferment of armed men running to take up their positions.</p>

  <p>"I have spoken to the Commissioner," said Hamilton, "and we have agreed
  that in future you will confine your musical exercises to a muted
  mouth-organ&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Very low, dear old officer," murmured Bones reproachfully. "Very hoi
  polloi, dear old sir."</p>

  <p>"Or a Jew's harp or a concertina." Then, seeing the eyes of Lieutenant
  Tibbetts light up: "A very small one&mdash;preferably rubber-tyred."</p>

  <p>"He that hath no music in his jolly old soul," said Bones with dignity,
  "is fit for the jolly old ashpit."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't like to see you there," said Hamilton, "but I'm glad you're
  sensible of your limitations."</p>

  <p>The tension of a very strained atmosphere was relieved by an order from
  Administrative Headquarters calling for the presence of the officer who
  carried out the execution of the old king's man. Bones was immensely
  interested.</p>

  <p>"I knew something would come out of that, dear old sir," he said
  thoughtfully. "Mind you, dear old push-face&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bones!" said his superior awfully.</p>

  <p>"I mean I'm not going to accept any decoration, dear old sir," said Bones
  firmly. "I shall simply say to the jolly old Excellency: 'Sir, I appreciate
  the honour that the jolly old Government wishes to&mdash;er&mdash;bestow, and
  I deserve it. I did all the work, but whilst jolly old Ham hasn't a C.B. to
  his name&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"I don't wish you to talk about me at all," said Hamilton coldly. "And if
  you think you're going up to H.Q. to get bouquets, I'll tell you that the
  only flowers you're likely to get are those which will be handed to your
  next-of-kin. There's a kick coming. Haven't you seen the 'Private and
  Confidential'?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Tibbetts's long face grew longer. He fixed his monocle in his eye and
  surveyed his chief sternly.</p>

  <p>"If there is any kick coming, dear old superior&mdash;why me? Who is in
  charge on the Ochori? You, dear old Ham! Now don't try to get out of it.
  Uriah the Hi-tiddly-hi-ti did the same thing, and look what a horrible name
  he's got. As to that old order, I thought it was a joke&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A visit to any Administrator is a solemn and unnerving business. To a new
  Administrator such a call is to be obeyed with trembling knees.</p>

  <p>And Sir Macalister Campbell-Cairns was not only new but raw. They called
  him by various nicknames&mdash;an ominous sign. The man with one patronymic
  may be well loved; with two, well known; with half a dozen he is likely to be
  unpopular.</p>

  <p>He had not occupied the chair of office longer than five minutes before he
  gave to the world his System of Responsible Control, which was roughly as
  follows: Every administrative unit was to be divided into as many districts
  as there were European officers. Each officer was to control a district and
  be responsible for its well-being and good conduct. The fact that he did not
  have his dwelling within 300 miles of the country made little or no
  difference. He might be a subaltern officer acting as tutor to wild Houssa
  men who were being moulded into military shape and learning for the first
  time that a rifle was not an instrument designed to frighten people to death,
  but an arm of precision which performed certain functions with mathematical
  exactness: that, in fact, the bullet and not the "bang!" was the real cause
  of all fatalities which followed its discharge.</p>

  <p>Administrative Headquarters was the large name of a smallish town which
  was remarkable in that it boasted a municipality, a power plant, a waterworks
  and a reservoir in addition to a number of flat-roofed, whitewashed houses,
  built-in gardens where only the more exotic flowers flourished. Horse-drawn
  street cars rattled along its boulevards, there were steam trains that ran at
  odd intervals into the jungle of the hinterland, and on the horns of the
  crescent-shaped water-front were two concrete forts which looked like
  inverted pill-boxes, but each of which accommodated a quick muzzle-loader and
  two 4.7 quick-firers of modern character.</p>

  <p>In the main the population was made up of native ladies and gentlemen who
  wore respectively skirts and trousers. There were three churches to cater for
  the three degrees of Christianity which come to every native commune; the
  narrow and cheerless, the broad and cheerful, and the official brand which
  demands regular attendance on Sunday mornings and permits tennis and other
  decorous games for the rest of the day.</p>

  <p>All commissioners hate A.H.Q., where natives speak English and are called
  "Mister" and wear frock-coats, stove-pipe hats and tight enamelled shoes on
  the Sabbath. The officers of the Territories regard a summons to attend at
  this unholy place with the same enthusiasm as the mother of a family might
  look upon an invitation to the White House if it was quarantined for
  measles.</p>

  <p>Bones, who had no fear in his soul, journeyed coastwise to headquarters,
  his mind entirely occupied by the new-born decision to discard all musical
  instruments in favour of the saxophone. Occasionally he gave a thought to the
  enraged Administrator.</p>

  <p>Macalister believed in machine-guns, correspondence in triplicate, and
  confidence in the Man on the Spot. This latter belief originated when he
  found that he was the man. He hated all foreign wines and foreign dishes, had
  a passion for Scottish mutton and whisky, and possessed no faith whatever in
  the rising generation. When he was a boy, things were different. The people
  who went into the Diplomatic Service were gentlemen; women were modest and
  knew their place; children never spoke until they were spoken to.</p>

  <p>He was a tallish, broadish man, with shoulders like an ox and a very red
  face that had seen a lot of hard wear. It appeared to have been originally
  modelled in red wax and to have been carelessly left in the sun.</p>

  <p>"His Excellency will see you at once," said the third secretary, and
  looked at his watch. "You are ten minutes late." He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The boat was a day late, sir," said Bones.</p>

  <p>The third secretary shook his head again, took off his white helmet and
  peered into its depths with half-closed eyes, his lips moving. He seemed to
  be praying. Then: "This way, Mr. Tibbetts," he said, and walked rapidly down
  a corridor.</p>

  <p>Bones, who had all a military gentleman's loathing and contempt for the
  Civil Service, followed at a slower pace to express his independence.</p>

  <p>Sir Macalister was pacing up and down his large room, his hands clasped
  behind him, all the weight and burden of empire on his clouded brow. He shot
  a glance at the newcomer but did not pause in his exercise.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tibbetts, your Excellency," said the third secretary, in the tone of
  one who had caught the visitor after a hard chase.</p>

  <p>"Huh," said his Excellency.</p>

  <p>The secretary withdrew reluctantly: he would have liked to hear all that
  the Administrator had to say.</p>

  <p>"So&mdash;you&mdash;are&mdash;Mr. Tibbetts!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Your Excellency," snapped Sir Macalister. "No relation to the late
  &mdash;er&mdash;Sir John Tibbetts?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir&mdash;my father."</p>

  <p>"Oh!"</p>

  <p>The Administrator was at a disadvantage: Sir John was the greatest
  official that had ever come to the coast.</p>

  <p>"Indeed? Now, sir: will you tell me why&mdash;will you please tell me why,
  when you were policing the Chimbiri district, you executed, without judge or
  jury, one Talaki? You will say that you were in a perilous position. You will
  say that you were five hundred miles from the nearest magistrate. You will
  say that you have precedents. You will say that the other miscreant escaped
  because you were understaffed." He stopped and glared at Bones.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said Bones politely. "None of these cute little ideas occurred
  to me."</p>

  <p>"No, sir! Oh, indeed, sir! Now, sir&mdash;understand, sir! From this
  moment, sir!&mdash;and you may take this back to your Commissioner, sir! That
  no man is to die in his territories until his death warrant is signed and
  sealed, sir, by me, sir&mdash;the Administrator, sir! Or my authorised
  deputy, sir. Tell Mr. Sanders that, sir!"</p>

  <p>Bones was not in any degree ruffled.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," he said. "And when Mr. Sanders resigns, perhaps your
  Excellency will tell his successor?"</p>

  <p>"Resigns?" Sir Macalister grew purple. Sanders was a tradition at the
  Foreign Office. The last time he resigned, a most important administrator was
  recalled. He was told when he reached home that it was so much easier to find
  a new administrator than a substitute for the Commissioner of the River
  Territories.</p>

  <p>"Do you think he will resign, Mr. Tibbetts?" 'Lords' was almost mild.</p>

  <p>"Certain, sir: most unprofessional to send that kind of message by a jolly
  old subaltern." Bones shook his head reproachfully and added: "I might have
  to resign too."</p>

  <p>The effect of this threat was not apparent. Bones afterwards said that
  Ruddy reeled. At any rate he resumed his walking.</p>

  <p>"I'll go down and see him myself," he said. "It is shockingly unhealthy,
  but I must go. Why did you hang this fellow, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Because, sir," said Bones, "he killed another fellow, sir, an' took his
  jolly old lady wife..."</p>

  <p>He explained how. Sir Macalister, who was not accustomed to the raw of
  life, shuddered and stopped him halfway through his narrative.</p>

  <p>"Dreadful... you'd better come to dinner and talk it over, Tibbetts
  &mdash;seven-thirty sharp. Don't keep me waiting or I'll have you cashiered.
  And by the way, before I forget it, there is, I understand, some trouble in
  the old king's country. Ticklish business... wants tact. Tell Senders I'll
  come down by the next boat and ask him to arrange a palaver with the old man.
  Eh? No, no, I shan't want Sanders there. I'll fix the boundary
  question&mdash;seven-thirty sharp, and if you're a minute late, by...
  I'll&mdash;I'll have you hoofed out of the Army, I will, by gad!"</p>

  <p>Outside in the corridor Bones met a Sandhurst crony, one Stewart
  Clay&mdash;a child in white who wore the gold aiguilettes of an A.D.C. After
  the first whoop of joy and gladness:</p>

  <p>"He's not a bad old devil," said the A.D.C. disloyally, "but he eats too
  much and drinks too much&mdash;especially drinks too much! When you hear him
  talking like a Dundee mill-hand, you'll know you have only to ask, to have.
  He's been crossed in love too," he added bitterly. "Would you mind keeping
  off the subject of women, and especially Scottish women, tonight?"</p>

  <p>Bones promised.</p>

  <p>He came early and found Sir Macalister in the jocose or cocktail stage of
  affability. He even dared admit his purchase of a saxophone. The
  Administrator sneered at saxophones. Towards the end of dinner he confessed
  his own musical weakness.</p>

  <p>"Mon," he said, "ye're daft if ye wouldna raither hear the bonnie pipies
  than ony flibberjigibbet of a saxophone! Stewart, laddie, gie me ma pipes oot
  of ma trunkie!"</p>

  <p>When Sir Macalister talked this way he was happy: the stern Administrator
  had become the human Scotsman.</p>

  <p>For two hours Bones sat in awe on the edge of his chair, his big hands on
  his knees, his monocle fixed, glaring respectfully at a big man in evening
  dress, his lapel glittering with decorations, who strode springily up and
  down the long dining-room, a tartan-covered bag under his arm, four
  beribboned pipes erect... He played "Flowers of the Forest" and the "Lament
  of the Prince"... the pipes wailed eerily, dirgily but beautifully. And with
  his own administrative hands he put the bag beneath his guest's arm and
  taught him the strange, mad way of the bagpipes. Bones trod on air...</p>

  <p>"Ye're doin' fine! I'll gie ye an auld set I brocht oot for Stewart, but
  the laddie has nae gift for the pipes."</p>

  <p>And, near midnight:</p>

  <p>"Sit ye doon, Mr. Tibbetts. Ye'll be takin' the wee boat back to the
  Territories the morn? Aye&mdash;ye're young! Laddie, when I waur yere age I
  mind a wee bit lassie... Maggie Broon, by name. She waur a crofter's
  daughter, Tibbetts, she was no ma ain class, ye'll understaund..."</p>

  <p>Stewart Clay saw the visitor on his way to his hotel.</p>

  <p>"He's not a bad old stick, but I wish Maggie Brown had died before he saw
  her. I get her two nights a week neat and undiluted!"</p>

  <p>"Dear old Stewart," said Bones urgently, "which pipe is it that you hang
  round your neck&mdash;is it the one that makes the ee-ing noise or the jolly
  old oo-er?"</p>

  <p>Bones returned to his own headquarters a transfigured young man, and the
  engineer of the little Bassam was glad to see the back of him.</p>

  <p>"I thought something had got into the guides, Mac," he said to the
  captain, "and there was me sluicin' oil into the dam' engine to stop the
  squeak, an' it was that herrin'-gutted officer-boy playin' on his so-and-so
  doodah all the something time!"</p>

  <p>Sanders really did not mind&mdash;the presence of an Administrator in his
  area worried rather than awed him. He went down to the little concrete quay
  to say farewell to his Excellency, and since he had thoughtfully added
  certain comforts to the furnishings of the Zaire and reinforced the
  poverty-stricken cellar of the big white boat. Sir Macalister was almost
  friendly.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to have given you so much trouble, Mr. Sanders," he said affably,
  "but I'm going to make this an annual visit... previous administrators have
  been a bit too slack."</p>

  <p>"I should be very careful of the old king, sir, if I were you." said
  Sanders. "Personally, I should not have held the palaver&mdash;the mere fact
  that he asked for it so soon after the last little talk I had with his chief,
  looks very suspicious to me. You quite understand that this palaver was
  called by the king and not by me? He anticipated your message by twenty-four
  hours."</p>

  <p>"So much the better, Mr. Sanders!" beamed his Excellency. "I shall find
  him in a conciliatory mood!"</p>

  <p>The wheel of the Zaire began threshing astern. Bones, in spotless white,
  stood on the forward deck and saluted stiffly and magnificently, and the
  Zaire, backing slowly to midstream, turned her nose&mdash;to the black waters
  and, her stem wheel whirling excitedly, she passed the bend of the river out
  of sight.</p>

  <p>"I hope he drowns!" said Hamilton malignantly, as they walked back to the
  Residency. "And even drowning is too good for the man who introduced Bones to
  bagpipes!"</p>

  <p>But for once in his life Bones was content to leave the navigation of the
  boat in the capable hands of Yoka, who was chief engineer and
  shoal-smeller.</p>

  <p>"I'm here if I'm wanted, sir an' Excellency," he explained gravely. "The
  mere fact that I'm standin' on this jolly old deck sort of gives the fellows
  confidence."</p>

  <p>Sir Macalister, his sun helmet on the back of his head, paced up and down
  the awning-covered forebridge.</p>

  <p>"You must tell me any places of interest we may pass, Mr. Tibbetts," were
  his only instructions, and Bones was talking for the rest of the day.</p>

  <p>"... that jolly old island there, dear sir, was where I fell out of a boat
  and was nearly swallowed by a naughty old crocodile... if you stand over
  here, dear old sir, you can see... no, you can't!... yes, you can! There it
  is... that village in the trees... I was bitten by a shocking old mosquito
  and my jolly old arm swole&mdash;swoled&mdash;swelled up as big as your jolly
  old head... simply fearful!... You see that sandbank, sir, in the middle of
  the stream, sir? I was once stranded there for a whole day, sir... it was
  simply ghastly... nothing to see but water... That village there, sir, is
  called... I'm dashed if I know what it's called." The listening Yoka supplied
  the name sotto voce. "Umbala... that's it&mdash;Umbala... rather like
  umbrella, what? haw, haw! That's not bad, dear old sir..."</p>

  <p>"Well, what happened in the village?"</p>

  <p>"I was bitten by a dog there, sir... a jolly old cooking dog... simply
  terrible... I had to stay in bed all day, sir... That creek is called..."
  (Yoka obliged again.) "Libisini, that's it! It leads to a jolly old lake,
  sir, quite an extraordinary jolly old lake&mdash;all water and things... I
  once fell into that jolly old lake... I got quite wet..."</p>

  <p>At the Ochori city Bosambo awaited his guests, and when he discovered that
  Sanders had not come his face fell.</p>

  <p>"Lord, this is a bad palaver," he said, and for Bosambo he was serious.
  "For my spies have brought word that two of the old king's regiments are
  sitting on the far side of the mountain. And because of this I have gathered
  all my spears and have sent throughout the land for my young fighting
  men."</p>

  <p>Bones pulled at his long nose and pouted&mdash;sure evidence of his
  perturbation.</p>

  <p>"Oh, ko! You tell me bad news," he said dismally, "for this man is a
  King's man and a very high One."</p>

  <p>Bosambo surveyed the unconscious Macalister, busy at that moment, through
  his interpreter, in speaking to the headmen gathered to meet him.</p>

  <p>"To me he looks like a fat cow," he said, without offence, "and this is a
  wonder to me, that all your high Ones are fat and old."</p>

  <p>Bones was pardonably annoyed.</p>

  <p>"You're a silly old josser," he said.</p>

  <p>"Same like you, sah, and many times," returned Bosambo handsomely.</p>

  <p>All that evening Bones spent in a vain endeavour to dissuade the great man
  from making the journey. They had with them an escort of twenty Houssas, and
  the road to the mountains led through dense thicket in which riflemen would
  be practically useless.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tibbetts," said his Excellency tremendously, "a British official
  never shirks his duty. That sacred word should be written in gold and placed
  above his head, so that sleeping or waking he can see it!"</p>

  <p>"Personally, dear old sir," murmured Bones, "I never sleep with my jolly
  old eyes open. The point is, dear old Excellency&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tibbetts, you are growing familiar," said Macalister.</p>

  <p>Bones reasoned with the great man's A.D.C., and Lieutenant Stewart Clay
  gave him little comfort. "He has no imagination," he said, "except about
  Scottish women named Brown. Give him another cocktail and see what that
  does."</p>

  <p>Another cocktail produced in the Administrator nothing but a desire for
  music. Ten thousand Ochori warriors (for the city was now an armed camp)
  listened breathlessly to "The Campbells are Coming."</p>

  <p>"Master," whispered the fascinated Bosambo, "why does the lord walk up and
  down when he makes those strange belly noises? Are there worse sounds yet to
  come?"</p>

  <p>Later, when Bones produced his own gaily-ribboned pipes, Bosambo was
  answered.</p>

  <p>At daybreak they started, ten Houssas and a hundred and fifty picked
  spears, and came to the foot of the mountain as the last rays of the sun fell
  athwart the low bush-trees.</p>

  <p>"We'll rest here for an hour and finish the journey in the cool of night,"
  said Sir Macalister, who had been carried the last twelve miles of the
  journey.</p>

  <p>Bones wiped his hot and grimy forehead.</p>

  <p>"Better wait till the morning, sir," he suggested. "The men are all
  in."</p>

  <p>Sir Macalister smiled.</p>

  <p>"Keep you fit, my boy," he said jovially. "I know the music to bring 'em
  along. You shall have a little practice, Tibbetts, my boy&mdash;ye're not
  pairfect yet."</p>

  <p>In that great cleft of the Ghost Mountains which M'shimba-M'shamba had
  bitten in a night of terrible storm, a score of spears waited in the dark.
  The old king, wrapped in his rug of fur, crouched in the cover of the high
  cliffs, a hot bowl of glowing wood beneath his robe to give him warmth.
  Squatting at his feet, Joe the Trader sucked at a short, foul pipe.</p>

  <p>"... tell him that when this Sanders goes out he can go down into the
  Ochori when he dam' pleases..."</p>

  <p>One of the attendant counsellors had been lying flat and motionless on the
  rocky road, his ear pressed to the ground. Now he rose.</p>

  <p>"They come," he said, and hissed.</p>

  <p>The score of spears became a hundred. Form after form flitted past, the
  waning moon reflected from their broad spear-blades... flitted past and
  disappeared. Hereabouts the ground is littered with boulders and there was
  cover for three men behind each.</p>

  <p>"Let no man strike until they are a spear-length from me," coughed the
  king. "Sandi you shall bring me alive, also the young man with the silvery
  eye..."</p>

  <p>The counsellor by his side turned uneasily.</p>

  <p>"If the terrible spirits come&mdash;"he began, and Joe recognised the
  words.</p>

  <p>"Stuff!" he muttered. "Say, tell him he can have my skin if that happens
  ... spirits! Come on, Sanders, you beauty!"</p>

  <p>They heard the tramp of feet, caught fugitive glimpses of a swaying
  lantern. Behind the boulders men grew tense and gripped their killing spears
  hotly.</p>

  <p>Out of the bush that encumbered the lower slopes of the big hill, the
  lantern came into uninterrupted view.</p>

  <p>"Kill!" whispered the king.</p>

  <p>But, even as he spoke, there came from the advancing column a strange and
  horrible sound. It was the shriek of a wounded soul&mdash;the scream of a man
  tortured beyond endurance&mdash;a savage and exultant howl amidst the
  fiendish titterings of ghouls...</p>

  <p>For a second the king stood erect, paralysed, his face working; and then,
  with screams of fear, the hidden spearsmen began to run, blinded by terror,
  throwing spear and shield as they fled.</p>

  <p>"Tell him... only bagp&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>Joe's words ended in a sob and he fell to his knees, striving vainly to
  draw out the spear that transfixed him; for the counsellor of the old king
  had struck as he ran.</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear old sir," said Bones, as they tramped back to the Ochori city
  in the light of day; "terribly discourteous an' all that sort of thing. If a
  johnny makes an appointment a johnny ought to keep it."</p>

  <p>"It was an ambush, by gad!" quivered his Excellency, bumping up and down
  as the palanquin-bearers negotiated a rough bit of track. "It is no use, my
  dear man, telling me that it wasn't an ambush... that horrible white man with
  the spear sticking in him! Good God... awful!"</p>

  <p>"It may have been an ambush, dear old Excellency," admitted Bones; "but if
  it was, why did the jolly old sinners run away? That's what puzzles me."</p>

  <p>And Bones was perfectly sincere.</p>

     id="chap03">III. &mdash; THE VERY GOOD MAN</a></h2>

  <h3>First published as "Bones and the Qualified Nurse" in <i>The Grand
  Magazine</i>, Vol. 48, Sep 1925-Feb 1926</h3>

  <p class="first">THE spectacle of a white man going native may be
  romantic&mdash;it is largely a question of locality and the imaginative
  faculties of his biographer. In the islands that stud the smiling seas, in a
  setting that may consist largely of smelly copra, but can as easily be
  "masked in" by garlands of frangipane, a man may take to himself an
  olive-skinned mama and excite no more than amused contempt amongst his decent
  fellows. But in Africa...</p>

  <p>B'firi, the Christian woman, was young and comely. She had been the owner
  of three husbands, each of whom had loved her and died. After the third death
  the chief of her village held her for Sanders.</p>

  <p>"It is not good that young men should die so quickly," he said at the
  palaver which followed; "and in the days of my father&mdash;his
  &mdash;father, this woman would have died for her witchcraft, for it is clear
  that she carries in her body a poison too strong for men. But now, lord
  Sandi, those good days are past, and we bring her to you that you may say
  wise words to her."</p>

  <p>There was sarcasm here, but Sanders wisely overlooked the lapse. It was no
  more intricate or delicate a problem than hundreds of others which came to
  him for solution, but here he was relieved in his role of oracle.</p>

  <p>The woman B'firi, silent till now, spoke:</p>

  <p>"Lord, I am tired of men who never meet a good woman but they must have
  her better, and never walk with a bad woman but they leave her worse. I have
  spoken with the Jesus men on the Shagali river, and there I go to be washed
  in the river and wear cloth over my breast, for by this magic I will grow
  wings when I am old and live in the clouds with other ghosts."</p>

  <p>This solved the problem, and B'firi went off, paddled by her two brothers
  to the Baptist Mission on the Shagali river (which was little more than a
  creek and was certainly not a river), and there she was baptised, learnt to
  make tea, "did" the lady missionaries' laundry, and acquired other Christian
  virtues.</p>

  <p>She was clever. She learnt to speak English and read Bomongo in a year; at
  the end of eighteen months she was a lay preacher and went forth into the
  forest to carry the Word. Once, when she was conducting a mission of her own
  on the edge of the French Territory, there was a tremendous happening. A
  white man (sickly white he was) came swaying across the swamps. The people of
  the village called her, and she went out to meet him. His clothes were old
  and filthy, his solar hat was battered, brown, torn at the crown. She thought
  by the unsteadiness of his gait that he was drunk. He was. Behind him, at a
  respectful distance, walked his one carrier and servant, an elderly man of
  Angola, who supported on his head a large sugar-box containing the wealth and
  property of the unknown.</p>

  <p>It did not need the influence of B'firi to procure him the shelter of a
  new hut. The man was white&mdash;not the browny-white of Sanders, but the
  white of trodden chalk.</p>

  <p>In the morning B'firi with her own hands brewed him tea and carried the
  steaming bowl to his hut. The stranger sat up wild-eyed, glowered at her and
  took the tea from her hand.</p>

  <p>"Where's this?" he asked huskily, between gulps. "What a filthy country! I
  wish I were dead! O God, I wish I were dead!"</p>

  <p>She admonished him soberly&mdash;but in good English. The man blinked at
  her.</p>

  <p>"What's this... missionary station? Thanks for the tea." He fell back to
  his pillow&mdash;a folded coat&mdash;with a shudder, and closed his eyes.
  When he opened them again&mdash;she was still kneeling by the side of the
  skin bed, the bowl between her hands. He had once seen an ebony figure at
  Christie's like that&mdash;only that wasn't black. She did not wear the cloth
  which, wrapped tightly about a woman's body almost to the neck, proclaimed
  her Christian virtues. Only the little grass skirt, and all else of her was
  brown satin.</p>

  <p>"Missionary, are you?" he asked weakly, when she explained her presence.
  "Try your hand on me! I've lost everything&mdash;everything! I gave up all
  that makes life worth while when I came to this blasted
  country&mdash;sorry."</p>

  <p>She repeated the word with her lips: B'firi was what actors call a "quick
  study."</p>

  <p>She understood men, having sapped three of their lives, and knew that they
  were happiest when they were talking about themselves. John Silwick Aliston
  was immensely sorry for himself&mdash;he pitied John Silwick Aliston with an
  intense pity that brought tears to his eyes. At the end of the fourth day of
  listening he came to the conclusion that she was a miracle sent to show him
  the way to salvation. She, bored to weariness, contemplated a magnificent
  future. The end of it all was that, when they came to the missionary station,
  he married this native woman B'firi&mdash;the missionary who performed the
  ceremony in proper style (B'firi being a baptised woman) was newly arrived
  from England, and had no definite views about the colour line. He believed
  that all humanity were God's creatures and that heaven was populated by
  beings of a neutral pigmentation. So he pronounced John Silwick Aliston,
  bachelor, and B'firi, pride of his mission, man and wife in the face of God
  and his congregation.</p>

  <p>Mr. and Mrs. John Silwick Aliston went back to her father's hut, and the
  bridegroom drank three parts of a pint of forbidden rum and cried himself to
  sleep. For he was a Bachelor of Arts of Oxford University, and was absurdly
  conscious of his degradation&mdash;"absurdly," because he degraded his caste
  with open eyes.</p>

  <p>Mr. Commissioner Sanders heard the shocking news from one of his spies and
  flew a pigeon to Lieutenant Tibbetts, of the King's Houssas, who was
  fossicking round the Akasava country, looking for an Arab who had reputedly
  smuggled arms into the country.</p>

  <p>Hoof Aliston out of country. Give hell missionary and report.</p>

  <p>Bones made his way back to the big gas-launch that had brought him
  up-river, and three days later came up with the village where Mrs. Aliston
  was waiting for her husband to recover sufficiently from his attack of
  delirium tremens to begin her fourth honeymoon. Happily the missionary was
  away, and Bones was spared the most painful of his duties.</p>

  <p>He found Aliston sitting before his hut, his head buried in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Arise an' shine, dear old Aliston," said Bones. "Pine not, as the jolly
  old poet says, for partin' brings a nice kind of feelin'; let's say good-bye
  till we meet at Ealin'."</p>

  <p>Aliston sprang up at the sound of a familiar tongue, and stood gaping at
  the unexpected apparition of a tall, thin, young man in a khaki shirt.</p>

  <p>"Oh, sorry! Good morning," he said awkwardly.</p>

  <p>"Pack up your dinky old traps, Aliston, dear old bird. Sunstroke very bad
  for you, sir an' wanderer. Fellows do things when they get a touch of jolly
  old Sol..."</p>

  <p>Dimly the man began to understand.</p>

  <p>"What is the idea, and who the devil are you?" he demanded
  resentfully.</p>

  <p>"Deputy Commissioner, sir." Bones was very gentle. "Can't allow this sort
  of thing... good gracious! don't you know Kiplin'? 'White is white an' black
  is black, but they keep their own side of the street' an' all
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>All that was masculine in John Aliston coalesced in a gesture of
  defiance.</p>

  <p>"You won't think I'm rude if I tell you to mind your own business?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I shall, dear old Aliston&mdash;I certainly shall," proclaimed Bones. "I
  shall be simply fearfully upset. Get your kit, old sir."</p>

  <p>Aliston stood squarely on his feet, his hands on his hips.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going&mdash;and you can't force me."</p>

  <p>A bony fist shot out suddenly and caught him under the jaw. The man
  sprawled down with a thud, and came whimpering and cursing to his feet. Twice
  Bones hit him before he fell and lay.</p>

  <p>"Get up, silly old Aliston;" and, when he did not move, Bones stooped,
  gripped and brought him to his feet.</p>

  <p>"You swine... !" sobbed John Silwick. "To hit a sick man... you
  brute!"</p>

  <p>He went meekly enough between the two Houssas whom Bones's shrill whistle
  had brought to the spot.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Aliston came flying through the village at the one end as her husband
  disappeared at the other.</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this?" she demanded in a grey fury.</p>

  <p>Bones answered her in the native tongue. "Woman," he said, "this man
  belongs to my people, just as you belong to your people. There is the river
  and there is the land, and where they mix is mud and a stink."</p>

  <p>"I am his wife," she answered tremulously, and there was murder in her
  eyes. "We are God-people and I have a book to show that I married in the
  God-man way. Also..."</p>

  <p>She invented on the spur of the moment a very excellent reason for
  desiring her husband's companionship.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to know anything private, dear old B'firi," said the
  agitated Bones very loudly.</p>

  <p>She followed him down to the boat, arguing, pleading, threatening. Every
  dozen paces or so they stopped, Bones's long arms waving eloquently, Bones's
  thin shoulders shrugging with great rapidity. When the Wiggle cast off she
  took a canoe and six paddlers and followed him down the river. By the worst
  of luck the Wiggle struck a sandbank and grounded. She climbed aboard and was
  thrown into the river by the indignant soldiery, and, anchoring her canoe at
  the stern of the launch, refused to move.</p>

  <p>In the short period of her new matrimonial experience, she had acquired
  vivid additions to her vocabulary.</p>

  <p>Bones listened to her opinion of him for three seconds and then put his
  fingers to his ears.</p>

  <p>"Naughty&mdash;naughty!" he roared. "You mustn't say that&mdash;you really
  mustn't... you won't go to heaven..."</p>

  <p>"&mdash;&mdash;!" screamed Mrs. Aliston, employing one of her husband's
  most popular directions.</p>

  <p>In the night, whilst she and her paddlers slept at the bottom of the
  canoe, one of the soldiers slipped overboard and towed her to the shore,
  fastening the grass rope with many knots, whilst his fellows, knee-deep on
  the shoal, pushed and shoved the Wiggle to deep water. In the morning, when
  she woke, the prison of her husband was gone and B'firi paddled back in fury
  to the mission station. Half-way she landed at a fishing village. The old
  chief of this was very rich, and all his wives wore big brass collars to
  testify to his affluence.</p>

  <p>"If you come to my hut I will make you my chief wife and give you rings of
  brass for your legs as well," he said. "Also I will make you a fine new hut
  and my old wife shall be your servant."</p>

  <p>B'firi pondered the matter.</p>

  <p>"Will you become a Christian and let me wash you with water and say holy
  things to you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"One ju-ju is like another ju-ju," said the ancient philosopher, and Mrs.
  Aliston made her fifth marriage.</p>

  <p>Sanders was on one side of his worn desk and a sullen, bearded man on the
  other.</p>

  <p>"The point is, Mr. Aliston"&mdash;Sanders's voice on such occasions as
  these had the quality of an ice-cold razor&mdash;"that marriage in these
  territories cannot be performed between Europeans without a certificate
  issued by me. Therefore your marriage was illegal in every sense. I feel that
  I should be wasting my time and yours if I attempted to bring home to you the
  foulness of these mixed marriages."</p>

  <p>"It is a matter of opinion," growled the man, and then: "What are you
  going to do with me?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sending you home as D.B.S. by the first available steamer," said
  Sanders.</p>

  <p>The man went hot and red. His was the type of pride which revolted at
  being classified as a Distressed British Subject. Poverty with legitimate
  excuses he could confess. But to fix such a patch to the rags of his failure
  was intolerable.</p>

  <p>The day the steamer called, he was missing. He had struck inland, and when
  they next heard of him he was teaching the interested Isisi the art of making
  mealie beer. Bones, with two trackers, went after him, but he had news of
  their coming. For three months they lost sight of him. Then Sanders, going
  up-river, was stopped in midstream by an old chief with a grievance.</p>

  <p>"B'firi my wife has gone away into the forest with a white man," he
  quavered. "And, lord, she has taken a cat collar of brass that is worth a
  hundred goats..." Sanders cursed under his breath and sent a pigeon back to
  headquarters.</p>

  <p>This time Hamilton, with Bones and half a dozen Houssas, took up the
  trail, which led to the French border and the discovery of a new crime. An
  Arab trader had been attacked by a dozen lawless tribesmen led by a white.
  Four cases of gin had been stolen and a man killed.</p>

  <p>Captain Hamilton did not stop to inquire into the presence of the
  gin-sellers so close to the forbidden area, but turned at right angles, and,
  late in the afternoon, came up with the camp of the robbers&mdash;nine
  stertorous and unconscious men and a dead woman; the long fingers of John
  Silwick Aliston were still about her throat when they found him, and Bones
  had to pry them loose.</p>

  <p>"Poor old thing," said Bones in a hushed voice, as he looked down at the
  silent figure.</p>

  <p>And then the glitter of something at her wrist caught his eye. It was a
  little golden bracelet, a cheap, hollow affair which had once held three
  small stones. One remained, a tiny, lustreless diamond. Stooping, he pressed
  the catch of the thing and drew it off.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" said Hamilton, as he took the featherweight trinket in his hand.
  "That little bracelet could tell a story. Bones." He turned it over on his
  palm. "American-made&mdash;five dollars net. How the devil did it get into
  the Akasava country?"</p>

  <p>He handed the jewel back and Bones slipped it into his pocket...</p>

  <p>It was at three the following afternoon when Aliston became dimly aware of
  a life which was fast slipping from him.</p>

  <p>"Hallo!" He looked up into the grave faces of the two officers. "Got me,
  eh? Where's B'firi?"</p>

  <p>They did not answer.</p>

  <p>"Hum... did I hurt her?"</p>

  <p>The elder of the two men stooped and put something into his hand. It was a
  book.</p>

  <p>"Prayer-book&mdash;what's the idea?"</p>

  <p>Hamilton's eyes met his.</p>

  <p>"In half an hour you hang," he said briefly. "Five of your friends have
  drunk themselves to death; the other two will go the same way as you. You
  don't want a judge and jury to try you, I suppose&mdash;with your name and
  filthy crime in the English papers?"</p>

  <p>Chalk-faced, trembling, speechless, the man shook his head. They left him
  alone, but under their eyes, for the appointed time. One of the soldiers
  climbed a tree and fixed the rope, and then Bones walked to the man, who was
  squatting where they had left him, his head on his breast.</p>

  <p>"Come," said Lieutenant Tibbetts tensely, and laid his hand on the
  shoulder of the doomed man.</p>

  <p>With a scream, Aliston leapt up. For a second he stood swaying, and then
  stumbled and collapsed in a heap. He never regained consciousness, but died
  in the cool of the evening, and they buried him apart from the natives who
  swung from the trees.</p>

  <p>It was generally agreed that Bones was not to be trusted alone. He was a
  good officer and a gallant fellow, but solitude and the absence of human
  props went straight to his head.</p>

  <p>And he had been left practically alone on the station. Mr. Commissioner
  Sanders was up-country on his annual tax-collection, and Captain Hamilton was
  in bed with a very ordinary and conventional attack of malaria. It is true
  that he had the queer illusion that he was falling through the mattress of
  his bed right on to the spiky parts of the Albert Memorial, but that isn't
  really serious. People inured to malarial symptoms know that a case is only
  dangerous when the patient believes that he is Queen Victoria and that he is
  playing poker with Julius Caesar for the fishing rights of the Rubicon.</p>

  <p>Bones did not think his superior officer was in the slightest danger, nor
  did Sanders, nor did Hamilton, and the only wish that the sufferer had
  expressed was that Bones should refrain from nursing him.</p>

  <p>It was unfortunate that the land wire which at odd periods connects the
  River Territories with Headquarters should have been repaired that week. The
  wire passes through the elephant country, and when the pachyderm isn't
  scratching himself against the wooden poles, he is pulling down the wire to
  discover whether it is good to eat. H.Q., in a burst of energy, had repaired
  it that week.</p>

  <p>"O.K.?" asked H.Q.</p>

  <p>Bones scribbled out a message and it was transmitted as spelt by the
  unimaginative half-caste telegraphist, who, to do him justice, thought he was
  sending a cipher message of the highest importance.</p>

  <p>All well all well stop Comisoner at Ississi Isissi stop Hamulten sufering
  sevvere doze of marlarier but am carying caryrying carying on stop will do my
  best to save Hammilton life but few feare fear the wost stop I will do my
  duty dutty.</p>

  <p>Bones had an exasperating habit in all his written correspondence of
  spelling most words three times to discover which looked the most correct.
  If, as Sanders had so often pointed out to him, he had had the intelligence
  to cross out the two which found least favour in his eyes, his correspondence
  would have gained in clarity.</p>

  <p>And then a great idea struck him. In case of serious sickness.
  Headquarters sometimes sent assistance. It was a privilege that Sanders
  claimed, and yet why not?</p>

  <p>"Send good nurse," he added to the wire.</p>

  <p>It looked lame. What Hamilton wanted was a motherly sort of woman... Bones
  added a technical adjective.</p>

  <p>He stalked soberly back to the Residency, went into Hamilton's bedroom and
  laid a clammy hand on the brow of the sleeping officer.</p>

  <p>"What (something violent) do you want, you (something worse)?" demanded
  the enraged invalid.</p>

  <p>"Bones is here," murmured the visitor reassuringly. "Jolly old Florence
  Nightingale, dear old officer. Want anything, dear old Ham?"</p>

  <p>"I want you to go to so-and-so out of here," cursed the sick man.</p>

  <p>"Delirious!" murmured Bones, and tiptoed out, knocking over a table in his
  passage. "Tut, tut!" said the annoyed young man as the door slammed.</p>

  <p>All that day and the greater part of the next he spent in devising little
  comforts for the invalid. Mama Pape, the Residency cook, watched the making
  of a jelly respectfully: Bones made it from a recipe he found in a cookery
  book. It was a pretty good jelly, but never quite reached the jelly
  stage.</p>

  <p>"No, I won't drink it!" raved Hamilton. "I refuse to be poisoned... you
  made it? My&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>Cup and contents flew through the open window.</p>

  <p>"Naughty, naughty," said Bones, in the tone of a mother to her child. "Let
  ickle Bones take um jolly old temperature."</p>

  <p>Hamilton pointed a yellow hand to the door and glared fiendishly, and his
  attendant was hardly out of the room before he heard a bolt shot and the
  baleful voice of Hamilton hailed him.</p>

  <p>"I've got an automatic and ten rounds here, and if you try to nurse me
  I'll blow the top of your head off."</p>

  <p>"Dangerous," murmured Bones, and shrugged away his responsibility.</p>

  <p>Left alone, the sick man swallowed three quinine tabloids, drank deeply of
  barley water, and went off into a healthy sleep.</p>

  <p>The following afternoon, Bones was dozing noisily on the stoep of the
  Residency. The moving rays of the sun crept across the broad, white stoep and
  focused on the corn that decorated Lieutenant Tibbetts's little toe. He, too,
  dreamt. He was being burnt at the stake before Trinity College, Cambridge,
  for having spoken disrespectfully of the Jockey Club. The flames were licking
  his feet&mdash;especially one foot.</p>

  <p>"Ouch!" said Bones painfully, and awoke to rub the outside of his mosquito
  boot tenderly.</p>

  <p>And gradually, as he regained his faculties, he became aware of an
  extraordinary vision. There was sitting on a deck-chair, not half a dozen
  feet away from him, the most beautiful lady he had ever seen. She was young,
  and against the green of her helmet lining her hair shone like red gold. The
  lips that showed in the delicate face were almost a geranium red. They were
  curved now in a smile and the blue-grey eyes sparkled with laughter.</p>

  <p>"Bless my jolly old soul!" murmured Bones, and allowed his long, lank body
  to subside into the chair again. "Bless my jolly old soul... shouldn't eat
  pork... phew!"</p>

  <p>"Wake up, please!"</p>

  <p>Bones opened one eye and saw all of her; opened the other and sat up, his
  jaw dropping.</p>

  <p>"I've been sitting here patiently for a quarter of an hour," she said, and
  then, looking past her, he saw two large steamer trunks, a suit-case, a bag
  of golf clubs and a tennis racket.</p>

  <p>"I'm the nurse from the Victoria Hospital," she said.</p>

  <p>Bones staggered to his feet, uttering meaningless sounds.</p>

  <p>"Bless my life and jolly old pants!" he gasped. "You're the young person
  ... you're a bit young... how did you get here, dear old nurse?"</p>

  <p>"By boat," she said. "I arrived by the Pealego."</p>

  <p>"Come to nurse dear old Ham! Bless my life, what a peculiar thing!"</p>

  <p>She stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Ham&mdash;a man?"</p>

  <p>Bones nodded.</p>

  <p>"Fever?"</p>

  <p>Bones nodded again, and she seemed relieved.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't want nursing, dear old miss&mdash;"he began.</p>

  <p>"Is he dead?" she asked callously.</p>

  <p>Bones gaped, horrified&mdash;stared at her for a moment and dashed into
  the interior of the Residency. In ten seconds he leapt out again.</p>

  <p>"No, young miss," he said, "he's alive. What I meant to say was that I'm
  nursing him my naughty old self."</p>

  <p>She gazed at him solemnly.</p>

  <p>"And he's alive," she said, half to herself.</p>

  <p>Bones was hurt.</p>

  <p>"And kickin'," he said reproachfully. "It may surprise you, dear old
  nursin' sister, but I'm a qualified nurse."</p>

  <p>"You are?" She was, as he anticipated, surprised.</p>

  <p>"I are, dear old red-cross one. I had ten lessons by correspondence.
  Symptoms, dear old nursing sister, are my speciality. I can tell at a
  glance&mdash;"He frowned at her critically. "You've got sunstroke&mdash;one
  eye's bigger than the other."</p>

  <p>"It isn't!" she protested, pulled open the little bag she had on her lap,
  and drew out a very small mirror. "It isn't!" she said wrathfully. "They're
  both the same size. Where is the patient?"</p>

  <p>Bones waved a large and sinewy hand to the door, fixed his monocle and
  looked serious.</p>

  <p>"Treat him kindly," he begged. "In case of any relapse send for me, dear
  old Betsy Gamp... mind the mat... second door on the left. If he gets violent
  I'll come in with a jolly old mallet an' give him a sleeping draught."</p>

  <p>He heard negotiations being conducted through Hamilton's closed door;
  heard the startled exclamation of his superior and the bolts pulled back.
  "Who on earth sent for you, nurse?" A low reply. Bones smiled complacently.
  He had accomplished something... he wondered if she played tennis or just
  owned a racket.</p>

  <p>That evening he sat waiting for the nurse to make her appearance. It was
  within half an hour of dinner, and though he had caught a glimpse of her
  hurrying from the kitchen to the sick-room, the opportunities for
  conversation; exchange of confidences had not been offered. Every time he
  intercepted her she had some excuse for avoiding intellectual contact. The
  first time:</p>

  <p>"I was goin' to say to you, dear old miss&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She raised her finger to her lips. "Hush!" she whispered. "He is
  asleep."</p>

  <p>And the second time: "I didn't ask you your name, dear old sister of
  mercy; you see, I'm in charge&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Up went her warning hand. "S&mdash;sh!" she breathed. "He is just waking
  up."</p>

  <p>Bones was sitting, his gloomy mind fixed on the neglect he suffered, when
  he heard&mdash;the puc-a-puc of the Zaire's stern wheel in the still night,
  and over the trees saw the haze of her smoke. In a second he was racing down
  the quay to meet the Commissioner. "Yes... got back a week earlier than I
  expected&mdash;the Akasava people are growing honest or else wanted me out of
  the country. How is Hamilton&mdash;I got your pigeon message&mdash;nothing
  serious, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said Bones, and felt the moment opportune to announce the new
  arrival.</p>

  <p>"A nurse?" repeated Sanders, amazed. "Why, in the name of heaven?"</p>

  <p>Bones coughed.</p>

  <p>"Dear old Ham has been pretty bad, sir," he said gravely. "Didn't even
  want to see me. When I peeked through his window, sir, he had his jolly old
  face to the wall, sir&mdash;so I sent for a nurse."</p>

  <p>"Does it matter on what side a man sleeps?" asked Sanders innocently.</p>

  <p>"Face to the jolly old wall, sir," murmured Bones, and shook his head.
  "That's one of the worst signs, sir, in the jolly old Pharmacoepia, sir. Face
  to the wall, sir... johnnies always pop off that way, sir."</p>

  <p>"Stuff!" said Sanders, with the ghost of a smile. "Still, if the old lady
  is here we must make her comfortable."</p>

  <p>Bones coughed again.</p>

  <p>"Not old, sir, not so jolly old, sir. Rather on the young side, dear sir
  an' Excellency. Pretty, sir, in a way," he added daringly, and saw Sanders's
  face fall.</p>

  <p>"It can't be helped&mdash;Hamilton will be all right. Headquarters are
  getting quite sprightly: as a rule they take a month to answer that kind of
  request."</p>

  <p>He greeted the girl kindly&mdash;admired her in his detached way.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I need stay very long." With a woman's instinct she guessed
  the reservations in his welcome. "Your Captain Hamilton isn't very ill. He is
  annoyed, but he is not ill."</p>

  <p>She looked fixedly at Bones.</p>

  <p>"Annoyance is illness," said Bones firmly. "A naughty temper is a sign of
  insanity, dear old hospital matron."</p>

  <p>When the girl retired for the night, Sanders, who had had a chat with the
  sick man to discover the real cause of his annoyance, took Bones out on the
  veranda and talked to him gently.</p>

  <p>"You must be awfully careful, Bones," he said. "I'm afraid you sometimes
  use words which are just outside the meaning you intend. For instance..." He
  gave an instance.</p>

  <p>"That means a motherly sort of lady, sir?" said Bones, in astonishment.
  "Bless my life, sir..."</p>

  <p>"Maternity nurse means something quite different," said Sanders, very
  steadily for a man who was shaking with internal laughter. "And naturally
  Hamilton is a little peevish..."</p>

  <p>Sanders employed the last morning of the girl's visit showing her round
  the station. Her name was Rosalie Marten, and she admitted her age as
  twenty-four.</p>

  <p>"It must be lovely to be away from the natives in tall hats and the
  electric light and cinemas," she said, drawing a long breath. "I came out to
  West Africa thinking I would have this kind of life&mdash;but Headquarters is
  a sort of Clapham plus sunshine. There is no work I could do here, Mr.
  Sanders?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"If it is not an impertinent question. Miss Marten, why have you come to
  the coast at all? Have you friends here&mdash;?</p>

  <p>"No," she answered shortly. "I hate the coast, that I know: in some ways
  it is better than I thought it would be&mdash;in most ways worse. I got my
  ideas from a trade newspaper that is run by a man who has never seen the
  other side of the Sierra Leone mountain&mdash;my father is a journalist and
  told me this. I hate the place&mdash;I hate it!"</p>

  <p>The vehemence in her tone made him look at her sharply, and looking, he
  guessed&mdash;a man. There was no need to guess, for almost instantly she
  told.</p>

  <p>"The man to whom I was engaged died here." She was cruelly frank. "He came
  out two years ago."</p>

  <p>Only for a moment did the voice lose control. Sanders was silent. Such
  confidences as these almost hurt him. The coast ate up these young lives
  ruthlessly, and this tragedy of hers had its duplicate.</p>

  <p>"He was the very best man in the world&mdash;he came out to make
  sufficient money to buy a home. I am rather rich, Mr. Sanders, and he had to
  run the gauntlet of family suspicion. They thought he was a
  fortune-hunter&mdash;they told him this to his face, though I never knew this
  till afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Was he... a missionary?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head and smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"No... he was a very good man, but he was not a missionary. He died
  somewhere in the French Territory&mdash;he wrote to me soon after he arrived
  on the coast. It is terrible..." She frowned. "Every day I pass the hotel
  where he stayed when he was in Headquarters... I know the window of the room.
  He looked out of there upon the street along which I walk. It isn't
  believable, Mr. Sanders&mdash;it simply isn't believable!"</p>

  <p>Sanders realised that she was talking as she had never talked to any human
  being. That she was expressing in words the long-inhibited confidence she had
  ached to give to somebody. He let her talk on without interruption as they
  slowly paced across the arid, dull ground.</p>

  <p>"I've bored you awfully, but I feel better!" she said, half laughing, half
  crying. "I've often wished I were a Catholic so that I could confess to
  somebody. I suppose I shall recover in time and marry some poor man and put
  away my romance between sachets of lavender-hearts aren't easily broken."</p>

  <p>When she went to her room, Sanders found an opportunity to utter a
  warning.</p>

  <p>"'Ware light conversation dealing with death and destruction, you
  fellows," he said. "This poor girl has had a very unhappy experience."</p>

  <p>It was no disloyalty to her confidence to outline the tragedy that
  shadowed this young life.</p>

  <p>"We've got to be cautious an' entertainin', dear old sir and Excellency,"
  said Bones, touched.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake don't be that!" Sanders and Hamilton spoke together.</p>

  <p>"Maybe, insulting old superior, I could show her my curios?" suggested
  Bones, ruffled. "But of course, dear old sir, if you think the innocent old
  person would be corrupted&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't mind her being corrupted&mdash;I object to a guest being bored,"
  said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Get your curios, Bones," said Sanders good-humouredly, "but don't
  &mdash;er&mdash;enlarge on their history."</p>

  <p>Bones sprinted to his hut and collected, hastily, the wherewithal of
  entertainment. Rosalie Marten came back to find three preternaturally solemn
  men who were galvanised at the sight of her into such a froth of artificial
  cheerfulness that she guessed the cause.</p>

  <p>"You've been telling my sad story!" she said, almost flippantly. "I'm
  glad&mdash;but please don't be mysterious about it. I have an awful feeling
  that you are all on tenterhooks for fear you hurt my feelings&mdash;please
  don't be tactful!"</p>

  <p>Bones looked for a moment embarrassed, for he had arranged to be very
  tactful indeed. His pockets bulged with curios, gathered in the dark from the
  big box under his bed.</p>

  <p>"We will be sorry to lose you, dear old miss," he said, when the strain
  which the effort of silence made had passed off and the Arab boy had handed
  round the coffee. "Three lumps or four? Bless my jolly old life, don't you
  take sugar? You'll never get as fat as podgy old Bones!"</p>

  <p>"Mountainous is a better word," said Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Which reminds me." Bones fumbled in his pocket. "This may cause you
  endless fun an' amusement, dear old hospital walker. It's the finger ring of
  the fattest man in the Territories&mdash;N'peru, the Akasava man..."</p>

  <p>He brought out a handful of miscellaneous oddments, wire bangles and
  anklets, carved wooden spoons, two strings of wooden beads, and a steel comb
  or two, and laid them on the table.</p>

  <p>"This is a N'gombi woman's dinky little vanity bag&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He heard her little scream and looked round in affright.</p>

  <p>She had risen from the table and was staring at the little heap on the
  cloth. Her face was as white as death, and her trembling hand pointed at
  something.</p>

  <p>"Where... where did you get that?"</p>

  <p>She was pointing to a tarnished gold bracelet that had two stones
  missing.</p>

  <p>"That... hum..." Bones for the moment forgot the injunction that had been
  served on him. "Well, to tell you the truth, young miss, that was
  taken&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At that moment he caught Sanders's eyes, cold, prohibitive, and
  stopped.</p>

  <p>"He... he had that," she said in a hushed voice, and picked up the jewel
  tenderly. "I bought it when I was a child... daddy took me to New York and I
  asked him to buy it. I gave it to... to my boy as a keepsake."</p>

  <p>It was Sanders who found his voice first.</p>

  <p>"What was the name of your&mdash;fiance, Miss Marten?"</p>

  <p>She was fondling the battered little bracelet, a smile of infinite
  fondness on her lips.</p>

  <p>"John Silwick Aliston," she breathed. "The best, the dearest man in the
  world."</p>

  <p>A silence so profound that she could have heard the deep breathing of the
  men, were she not so absorbed in the pitiful relic she held in her hand.</p>

  <p>"A very good chap, one of the best." Bones leapt into the breach. His
  voice was husky and he spoke in a jerky, breathless way. "Dear old
  John&mdash;what a lad!"</p>

  <p>She looked up at him quickly: the two men found breathing difficult.</p>

  <p>"You knew him?"</p>

  <p>Bones nodded; his blazing eyes held the light of inspiration.</p>

  <p>"Rather, dear old nurse. Met him up on the French border... real good
  fellow... fever..."</p>

  <p>"You were with him when he died?"</p>

  <p>Bones's head went up and down like an automaton.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;cheerful to the last&mdash;brave old fellow&mdash;full of
  pluck, dear old miss. Gave me this bracelet for his girl&mdash;never told me
  her jolly old name, though. One of the best, dear old John&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped, exhausted by his effort.</p>

  <p>She looked for a long time at the trinket, then held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said in a low voice. "I shall always think of you. I am
  sure you were good to him&mdash;God bless you!"</p>

  <p>Bones could have wept.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap04"
     id="chap04">IV. &mdash; WOMEN WILL TALK</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Short Stories</i>, Mar 10, 1926</h3>

  <p class="first">IF you hack down a copal tree and let it lie in a high place
  where the sun can warm it and the rain cannot rot, and, when it is duly
  seasoned, you cut a three-yard length of it and with great patience carve out
  its middle from one end, you have an instrument of communication which was
  ancient when the French revolutionaries were experimenting with the
  semaphore, and was effective in the days of the Caesars.</p>

  <p>M'gliki, the lokali man of the Akasava city, was very, very old and nearly
  blind, so that he stumbled about, upsetting cook-pots and breaking rare clay
  vessels, and this was a family scandal because, by law, the family
  connections of silly people are responsible for the damage they do in their
  foolishness.</p>

  <p>Yet, old and fumbling as he was, there was no man in all the world (which
  stretches from the Ghost Mountains to the River With One Bank that we call
  the sea) could play upon the hollow tree-trunk like M'gliki. Seated before
  the battered trunk and wielding two heavy sticks, he sent forth his rolling,
  rataplanning messages, the gossip of the city, urgent calls to far-away
  fishermen, personal messages from family to family, tales of death and birth,
  of marriage and newly discovered scandal. Every flourish, every cadence of
  the lokali, that most wonderful signal drum, has its significance. Sanders of
  the river could read M'gliki's messages thirty miles away on a still night,
  for the old man never made an error.</p>

  <p>"Long roll... short roll... long roll..."</p>

  <p>That was Sanders by name: a little "tune" that followed meant going south;
  three sharp taps on the end of it was the equivalent of "no complaints."
  Sanders got to recognise the name of every chief and tribe that the drummer
  tapped forth. Could read warning and promise, tale of theft or murder. All
  day long the old man sat before his wooden drum staring with unseeing eyes
  across the broad river. When the rains came they built a little shelter for
  him, otherwise he would have stumbled back to his hut and broken more pots
  that the family must pay for.</p>

  <p>After a particularly disastrous evening, when M'gliki had trodden on the
  hafts of three new spears, had overturned a pot of fish and half killed a
  valuable cooking dog, his eldest son and his youngest brother had a secret
  conference.</p>

  <p>"Let us go hunting in the Forest of the Little People," said the son, "and
  we will take M'gliki with us, saying that we need him. And when we are there
  and he sleeps, we will go away and leave him, and, being an old man and
  blind, he will soon die."</p>

  <p>The son and the brother took away their relative one morning and paddled
  for five days until they came to the Dark Woods. M'gliki sat at the bow, with
  a tiny but sonorous little lokali, and his drum rolled all the way, telling
  the world that he was M'gliki, the famed lokali man, and that these with him
  were his fine strong son and his own brother.</p>

  <p>In the forest they slept one night, and, hiding the small lokali, they
  slipped away in the light of the moon, leaving an old man to face the fierce
  little bush people and the yellow-eyed leopards that slunk from tree to tree
  in a wide circle about him.</p>

  <p>And here he might have died, but a little girl found him and led him to a
  place of ten huts (which is a large village in the bush sense). Her name was
  Asabo, and she was very ugly even at the age of seven. Her father was the
  first man of the village, and when he had overcome his natural desire to try
  the effect of a new poison with which he had tipped his arrow-head upon the
  unsuspecting visitor, he gave him a corner of his hut. And from then onward
  the bush people possessed a new asset, for M'gliki spent his days teaching
  Asabo the wonder. The small lokali had been found hidden under a tree, and,
  to the wonder of the village, Asabo progressed in wisdom.</p>

  <p>"You shall be the greatest woman in the world," prophesied M'gliki. "You
  shall marry a chief and sleep on a skin bed; also you will have three lovers,
  who will come to you at different times, and none shall know the other, and
  your husband shall know none."</p>

  <p>Asabo made a hoarse noise of pleasure, for when this prophecy was made she
  was ten and soon was to meet the Supreme Ouda.</p>

  <p>Now and again to all races comes a being of super intelligence whose
  personality dominates his fellows. These creatures are born at rare intervals
  and their influence runs beyond their own tribes. A play-acting Shakespeare,
  a versatile Leonardo, a brandy-inspired Peter Romanoff, a vision&mdash;seeing
  Mahomet, these magnetic mountains come smoking up in divers seas and set the
  compasses of mariners quivering to new northings.</p>

  <p>Mr. Commissioner Sanders had a large number of native agents who kept him
  in touch with events of interest to himself and his Government. These spies
  of his formed so competent an intelligence service that at any moment he
  could have given a rough survey of the social and economic conditions of
  every one of the twenty-three tribal communities it was his job to govern.
  From one area alone news was fragmentary and unreliable. In the deep forest
  of the Iguri dwelt the Little Hunters, a shy and savage people who brooked no
  interference and resented attention. A normal-sized spy, in a land where the
  average height of the people is thirty-eight inches, is necessarily a
  conspicuous figure.</p>

  <p>Sanders had held palavers on the edge of the forest with a tiny,
  pot-bellied headman, and had secured a promise of annual tribute in the shape
  of skins, rubber and gum copal; and this yearly contribution to the funds of
  government had been made regularly. Year after year, in the month of the New
  Green, the little Wiggle had chuffed up the long, narrow river which runs to
  the border of the Iguri forest and had found, in a clearing, an odd
  collection of rubber and gum piled up on one side of the landing-place and a
  stack of dried skins on the other. Generally there were in attendance two
  ferocious little men, who beat a retreat at the first sight of the launch and
  watched the transfer of the taxes from a respectable distance.</p>

  <p>There came a day when the launch was to find nothing&mdash;neither skins,
  nor gum, rubber nor men.</p>

  <p>The hour was near midnight. Sanders had gone to bed, but one of the two
  young men who played picquet under the light of the oil lamp had no
  appreciation of time.</p>

  <p>"That rubicons you, Bones," said Captain Hamilton complacently, as he
  totted up the score.</p>

  <p>Mr. Tibbett's face was a mask.</p>

  <p>"We'll have another game, dear old Ham," he said; "but, dear old officer,
  do you mind turnin' up your sleeves before we start?"</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you mean. Bones?" demanded his superior hotly.</p>

  <p>"Nothin', sir; a mere matter of precaution, dear old captain. You've held
  all the kings an' aces since ten o'clock. Play fair, dear old sir&mdash;all
  that I ask is that you turn up your sleeves."</p>

  <p>Hamilton transfixed him with a cold-light glare and dealt the cards. It
  was annoying that Bones fixed his monocle firmly in his eye and kept his gaze
  glued on the dealer's hands, and not remarkable in consequence that Captain
  Hamilton bungled the deal and gave himself one card too many.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Bones significantly. "Pick the cards you want&mdash;don't mind
  me."</p>

  <p>"Bones! You're insulting!" stormed the other.</p>

  <p>Bones gathered up his cards with a meaning smile.</p>

  <p>"I've got an ace, dear old manipulator!" he said, in mock concern. "Some
  mistake here, dear old Ham&mdash;would you like a fresh deal?"</p>

  <p>Hamilton said nothing&mdash;he scored a hundred and forty and capoted his
  opponent, who had misguidedly discarded his ace.</p>

  <p>"Shall I deal?" asked Bones politely.</p>

  <p>"If you please." Hamilton was very short.</p>

  <p>"I say nothing, dear old officer and gentleman, but I think a lot," said
  Bones, as he took up his hand.</p>

  <p>"I've never noticed it," said Hamilton. When it came to his turn to deal,
  he had to ignore the spectacle of Bones popping his head down to look under
  the table, and pretended that he did not see his unspeakable companion
  feeling the backs of the cards for secret marks.</p>

  <p>"Luck is luck, dear sir and brother officer," said Bones, examining his
  cards; "an' play is play. But dealin's got everything skinned to death." He
  frowned at the cards. "Excuse me, dear old Ham, but this doesn't look like
  the same pack&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Hamilton flung down his cards.</p>

  <p>"Bones!" he hissed. "If you suggest that I'm cheating I'll break your
  infernal head."</p>

  <p>"It will be the only part of me that's not broke, Ham, old light-fingers,"
  said Bones. "I've lost nearly four shillings in three hours!"</p>

  <p>"Which you'll never pay," said Hamilton fiercely, as he got up. "Bones!
  You're impossible. You will parade your platoon at 7 a.m. and put them
  through physical drill."</p>

  <p>"Dirty work!" murmured Bones. "The man not only ruins me but lets his
  naughty old temper get the better of him. Uses his dashed old superiority to
  make me a jolly old galley slave. You're worse than Uriah the wicked old
  Hittite. See Bible."</p>

  <p>The next morning Sanders came out of his little office looking unusually
  serious. He held between finger and thumb a cigarette-paper covered with fine
  Arabic writing. Hamilton saw the paper.</p>

  <p>"Pigeon?" he asked. "You were up early, sir."</p>

  <p>Sanders walked to the sideboard, turned the tap of the coffee-urn and
  brought his steaming cup to the table.</p>

  <p>"The sergeant of the guard brought the paper at daybreak," he said. "The
  little fellow had a hawk on his tail and was lucky to get here. Where is
  Bones?"</p>

  <p>Hamilton screwed his head sideways: through the open door he commanded a
  view of the parade ground, where a squad of twenty men were engaged in the
  military exercise which has come to be called "physical jerks." Lieutenant
  Tibbetts, in white duck trousers, sports shirt and helmet, was in command,
  and his raucous, squeaky voice came to them. His language was a curious
  mixture of coast Arabic, Bomongo and English.</p>

  <p>"O sons of awkward parents, is it thus I taught thee? You silly old
  jossers! When I say 'one,' put both hands upon thy loins and bend thy knees.
  Not as old women with creakings and groanings, but like young antelopes. Dash
  you, Abdul, keep still, you fidgety old blighter. Now sink to thy heels,
  keeping thy belly&mdash;oh, ko! Man, you are like a blithering old cow! Get
  up! Go down!..."</p>

  <p>"Bones seems to be busy," said Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Bones has to be disciplined," replied Hamilton primly. "He must
  occasionally be put in his place. I cannot allow Bones to describe me as a
  card-sharp and retain my self-respect. I played picquet with him last night,
  and I admit the cards ran badly for him. When he asked me to turn up my
  sleeves, I felt that he was going very far, but when&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He described what had happened; and although Sanders never felt less like
  laughing, he chuckled.</p>

  <p>"I was very annoyed indeed with Bones," said Hamilton, but he was
  grinning.</p>

  <p>The object of his annoyance came in to breakfast soon after, and Bones was
  stiff, not to say distant.</p>

  <p>"'Morning, Bones." Hamilton was in a conciliatory mood.</p>

  <p>"'Morning, sir." Bones saluted regimentally. "Parade dismissed, sir."</p>

  <p>"Come down off that horse of yours. Bones&mdash;you were insulting. Admit
  it."</p>

  <p>Bones, with a cup in one hand, saluted again with the other.</p>

  <p>"Any complaints you have, sir, should be reported to the jolly old
  commander-in-chief. I'll be glad to answer any letter you send to me, but, if
  you will excuse me, sir, we will not exchange badinage or saucy quips,
  sir."</p>

  <p>"Bones, I want you to go up to the Iguri forest and collect the Bushies'
  taxes." Sanders broke in upon the chilly atmosphere. "You may take the
  Wiggle, but you are not to land. If the bush people are normal I would like
  you to see their chief, but particularly I wish you to make contact with a
  man named K'belu. Avoid trouble&mdash;there may be quite a lot coming our
  way&mdash;but above all, keep your Maxims in working order until you are
  clear of the bush country."</p>

  <p>"It's quite on the cards&mdash;"began Hamilton, but his subaltern silenced
  him with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"Keep off your favourite vice, dear old sir," he said haughtily. "And
  anyway, I've finished gamblin'."</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure that you have," said Sanders quietly. "I shall be glad
  when you have returned&mdash;with or without the taxes."</p>

  <p>In the deeps of the great forest there had been born cala cala, a tiny
  little grey-brown animal whom its parents had called K'belu, the Brown Mouse.
  The place of his birth was a nest between the forks of an enormous oak, for
  his kind were the lowest type of pygmy people and his parents lived alone in
  the forest. Such was the immense spread of the fork that the floor of the hut
  was even and the grass-woven walls and roof combined with the protection
  afforded by the spread of the boughs to make the place watertight. And here
  he grew and thought, was fed and beaten, learnt the poisonous properties of
  plants and a certain strange caterpillar; and in due course accompanied his
  tiny father on his hunting expeditions.</p>

  <p>There was an enterprising missionary in the Iguri who had spent his life
  in the study of bush people, first in Central-South and now in Central-West
  Africa. He loved the bushmen because he believed that they were the first men
  in the world; and K'belu made his acquaintance at an early stage of his
  existence. The God-man had a house on the edge of the forest, where he grew
  bananas for the bushmen to steal. Even when they discovered that they could
  have the fruit for the asking, they continued to steal&mdash;this process of
  acquisition being less embarrassing than any other. One day the God-man,
  whose name was Father Matthew, caught K'belu in the act and chased him with
  surprising agility, remembering that he was a fat man and encumbered with the
  long, brown habit of his order. He did not kill K'belu, or pick out his eye,
  or bite his heart, or do any of the things which missionaries are supposed to
  do. He took the squirming child back to his garden, gave him a dish of goat's
  milk and as many bananas as he could carry. After, when the child came
  (timidly, suspiciously at first), he showed him certain devil marks, such as
  A and B and C. At the age of ten K'belu could read Bomongo, which is the
  language of the forest, larded with certain ancient words which are the
  pygmy's very own.</p>

  <p>Soon after this the missionary died of some obscure tropical disease, and
  on the night of his death K'belu went to his house and stole all the books he
  could gather and carried them away to his hut. When his father died, at the
  ripe old age of thirty-six, the boy went into the nearest village, carrying
  his father's arrows and his treasure. The chief of this tiny community gave
  him a hut in exchange for the arrows.</p>

  <p>And then, when the superiority of the newcomer was forced upon him (for
  did he not read books full of devil marks, like Father Matthew himself?), he
  took counsel with his wife and went to the hut of his guest.</p>

  <p>"I see you," he said, as he squatted down, and came at once to the point.
  "I have a daughter, and she is a wonderful woman, making strange noises on a
  tree-trunk, as she was taught by M'gliki, the N'gombi man who died of the
  sickness when the river was in flood and the woods were full of fish. I will
  give this woman to you for ten arrows and as much salt as a man can hold in
  two hands."</p>

  <p>"Arrows I have none, nor salt," said K'belu loftily; "but I will take this
  woman from you because I am a man with a wish for children."</p>

  <p>He was fifteen and of a marriageable age, and after some demur the father
  agreed and paid for the feast that constituted the wedding.</p>

  <p>Thereafter Asabo dwelt in the hut of her master, worked for him and
  absorbed his mystery&mdash;for all day long he thought and thought. There was
  at the back of his mind an idea, dimly seen at moments, never wholly
  comprehended. They saw him poring over dog-eared books, and the word went
  through the forest that K'belu was Ouda and a man to be propitiated. Now Ouda
  is the devil of the pygmy people, a worker of mischief and yet a giver of
  gifts&mdash;the only deity they know.</p>

  <p>His fame grew, and the idea became concrete. One day he summoned a palaver
  of all people, and none questioned his right, for the pygmies are a
  loose-knit democracy, without chiefs in the literal sense.</p>

  <p>"All men listen to me," said K'belu. "I have learnt by my magic that we
  are the high lords of the world because of our smallness. What men can climb
  as we? What men can swing from branch to branch? Who are feared as we? None
  in the world, because we are the masters of all people, who are our
  slaves."</p>

  <p>The little folk listened and wondered whilst the Idea found
  exposition.</p>

  <p>"Head of every tribe of the outer people," said K'belu, "was a chief.
  Above them was Sandi and his two sons. If the chiefs died and Sandi died, who
  would be master of the world? Surely their killers? And if new chiefs rose
  and a new Sandi came with his sons (the whole Territory insisted upon this
  relationship of Bones and Hamilton) they also would die until the omnipotent
  They who sent these white men to give the law would weary of their effort and
  the land would be left to the cunning little people."</p>

  <p>It seemed a good idea. Three thousand bushmen began to grow conscious of
  nationality.</p>

  <p>"In a moon and the rind of a moon Sandi will come to rob us of our gum and
  rubber and the little skins of monkeys. Or his son with the silver eye, or
  the man with the loud voice who shouts at the soldiers" (this was a libel on
  Hamilton). "But I, K'belu, the Ouda of the people, say that we will give him
  only the gum of caterpillars."</p>

  <p>His words had been heard in silence, but now an important man from the
  Dark Woods spoke: "This is good talk, K'belu, but if Sandi comes with his
  little gun that says 'ha-ha-ha!' there will be an end to us."</p>

  <p>He finished his words and fell forward, his breast on his knees; for
  K'belu, expecting opposition from this man, had stationed a creature of his
  in a tree, and at&mdash;his signal a bow twanged behind him and the
  arrow-head came redly out of his breast. There was no further opposition.</p>

  <p>K'belu went back and told his wife.</p>

  <p>"O K'belu, I see that you are Ouda, and a very great lord. And when you
  are king of the world I will wear beautiful brass anklets and sleep on a skin
  bed."</p>

  <p>She said nothing of the unfulfilled prophecy about the three lovers. They
  would arrive as a matter of course. In her joy and exhilaration she kept the
  village awake all the night. Through the dark hours her lokali rattled and
  droned the song of her triumph.</p>

  <p>For the first time in all probability since the days of the Egyptian
  dynasties, the bush-folk enjoyed a leadership. K'belu's first act was to
  round up the unsociable units that lived in the forest alone and combine them
  into villages The little men hated this interference with their
  liberty&mdash;they are the freest people in the world, and in consequence the
  most degraded&mdash;their wives made throaty noises of protest, their
  eighteen-inch sons and daughters trudged at their heels into the new
  compounds with a lively sense of excitement to come.</p>

  <p>In the midst of the greatest of the villages, K'belu set up a palace of
  grass, and here he met his awkward counsellors, who had never before engaged
  in communal activities. And so matters went till, on the wane of the second
  moon, came Bones, cautiously to the spot appointed for the collection of
  taxes.</p>

  <p>The Wiggle hung around for the best part of a week, and then Lieutenant
  Tibbetts sent a native into the forest to make inquiries. This messenger was
  a man of the Isisi, who knew the bushmen and spoke their queer language.
  Three days passed and then, in the middle of the night, a Houssa soldier woke
  Bones.</p>

  <p>"Master, I have heard strange sounds on the land near this little ship,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>Bones pulled his pliant mosquito boots over his pyjamas and went out on
  the deck to listen. It was a windless night of stars and there was no sound
  but the lap-lap of water against the boat side. No bird's hoarse note broke
  the stillness. A leisurely meteor streaked whitely across the sky.</p>

  <p>"What were the sounds, man?" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"The sound of men walking and the dropping of something on the ground,"
  was the reply.</p>

  <p>Bones bent his head, listening. He heard a gurgle in the water; that was a
  crocodile swimming past... nothing more.</p>

  <p>It was nearly five o'clock. The launch was moored to two gum trees, and
  the moving chains were paid out at nightfall so that there was a dozen feet
  between shore and boat, a position made possible by the conformation of the
  river's bank, for the drive of the current caught the Wiggle broadside on
  end; had the cables parted, she would have been pushed to the opposite
  bank.</p>

  <p>Bones went back into his cabin, slipped on an overcoat, found his electric
  torch, and took his automatic from under his pillow. The bow of the boat was
  nearest the shore, and he moved noiselessly forward till he stood against the
  little windlass to which the mooring rope was reeved.</p>

  <p>Then, suddenly pressing the button of the torch, he shot a beam of white
  light towards the bank. The light followed the direction of the taut cable,
  and the first thing he saw was a monkey&mdash;like figure coming hand over
  hand along the wire rope. Beyond, the bank was crowded with tiny, naked
  figures.</p>

  <p>Out went his light instantly and he dropped to the cover of the
  gunwale&mdash;and not too soon.</p>

  <p>"Tap... tap... tap!"</p>

  <p>A sound like the patter of hail. Bones waited until the first shower of
  poisoned arrows had fallen, then, jerking his Browning over the gunwale, he
  pumped ten shots into the midst of them.</p>

  <p>"Cover!" he roared as he heard the sleepy Houssas scrambling from their
  blankets.</p>

  <p>But no other arrow fell, nor did he expect a second shower. By this time
  the brown horde was flying to the cover of the woods. They never attacked in
  the face of firearms.</p>

  <p>Daylight came suddenly: a faint paling of the east that showed the
  motionless silhouettes of the big copal trees, a sudden pandemonium of sound
  as if a million birds had begun twittering at once, the mumbling chatter of
  monkeys, and the world was light and all the tree-tops were gilded in the
  first rays of the sun.</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" said Bones.</p>

  <p>Within a dozen yards of the river's edge a rough pole had been planted,
  and tied thereto was the native whom he had sent into the forest. At least,
  Bones guessed it was he: he was rather difficult to recognise.</p>

  <p>He stared for a long time at the dreadful thing and gave the order to warp
  the boat to the bank. The machine-guns fore and aft swung over to cover the
  dark trees behind which the little brown men were lurking.</p>

  <p>"Take a crew ashore, Ahmet, and let them bury the man."</p>

  <p>Bones watched the quick work from behind the fore Maxim, his eyes roving
  between the working party and the wood. When all was done and the men had
  washed themselves in the stream: "Cast off the big ropes," he said in the
  vernacular.</p>

  <p>The danger was by no means over. Before they reached the main river, the
  stream passed for two miles through the heart of the forest. The tributary
  ran between high banks not twenty yards apart, and here the trees came down
  to the very edge of the water, a heaven-planned site for an ambush. Moreover,
  a tree hastily felled would block his exit. Turning the nose of the Wiggle
  downstream, he took his place at the wheel.</p>

  <p>"Let all men take cover," he ordered, and, when this was obeyed, he drove
  the boat forward at full speed.</p>

  <p>Yoka, the steersman, alone remained with him.</p>

  <p>"Go, man," said Bones sternly.</p>

  <p>"Lord, this is death," said the stout Yoka, "for the little men will be
  waiting in the Narrow Place and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bones snarled round on him.</p>

  <p>"Go to cover or I will whip you till you bleed," he barked.</p>

  <p>Yoka went reluctantly.</p>

  <p>An hour's run through open country and the woods loomed ahead. There was
  no sign of a blockade&mdash;the woods were lifeless, but he saw birds
  circling round the tree-tops in an aimless, excited way, and knew that they
  had been disturbed.</p>

  <p>Locking the wheel, he slowed, and, diving into his cabin, brought out his
  dingy eiderdown quilt. Hanging this loosely over his head, he sent the boat
  at top speed for the narrow lane of water. Presently he was in the wood and
  darkness fell, for the trees form a green roof to the river.</p>

  <p>Bump!</p>

  <p>He had grazed the slope of a little sandbank and the launch veered and
  slithered until it was under the high bank. This accident gave him an idea.
  He kept the Wiggle as near to the dangerous bank as he could. The little men
  would be reluctant to leave cover...</p>

  <p>Two hundred yards ahead of him, he saw a big tree lying over at a
  suspicious angle and drooping slowly. Somebody was hacking furiously at the
  trunk... if it fell, its great branches would offer a barrier not to be
  penetrated. Bones watched, fascinated, forgetful of his own danger, till the
  first arrow struck a spoke of the steering wheel and went humming past his
  head at a tangent. He felt the smack of another as it struck the quilt,
  ripping the faded silk into slithers.</p>

  <p>The tree was leaning drunkenly... he shot under it as it fell and heard
  the rustle and crackle of twigs as they struck the stern of the boat.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" said Bones, as the trees began to thin. He threw aside the hot
  quilt. "Confound their little whiskers!"</p>

  <p>He was wet through, limp. He had gripped the wheel with such a fierce
  intensity that the palms of his hands were blistered.</p>

  <p>"O Yoka," he called, and, when Yoka came: "Bring me," said Bones, in the
  Arabic of the coast, "a dish of nectar such as the lily-eyed houris of
  Paradise pour from vessels of gold."</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the puzzled Yoka, "does your lordship mean whisky-soda?"</p>

  <p>"A double one," said Bones, and smacked his dry lips.</p>

  <p>His triumph died in his throat.</p>

  <p>Ahead, as the steamer turned a sharp bend of the river, he saw an isolated
  tree topple over and fall into the water with a mighty splash, and at that
  second the wood was alive with the little men, and the arrows came towards
  him in shoals.</p>

  <p>Bones reversed his engine instantly, but it was an eternity before he
  moved astern. The pygmies had broken from cover and were racing along the
  wooded bank. Death was before and behind, and though as yet the arrows fell
  short, they would reach him sooner or later.</p>

  <p>Leaving the wheel to Yoka, he sat down to the machine-gun and in a second
  the wood re-echoed to its staccato notes. As if by magic, the little people
  disappeared at the first shot. He stopped the engine and slowly the launch
  drifted back to where the larger part of his enemy was waiting. He surveyed
  the obstruction with a sinking heart. The Zaire would have broken through it,
  but he had a fifty-foot launch that would buckle up at the first impact.</p>

  <p>The arrows were still pouring down into the water; one struck the bow...
  in a very short time they would reach the deck.</p>

  <p>He turned, ran into his cabin and scrawled a message on a thin sheet of
  rice-paper. Yoka brought him the pigeon, and the dispatch was fastened to the
  red leg with a rubber band.</p>

  <p>"Home you go, you lucky old coo-er," said Bones, "an' I wish I was comin'
  with you."</p>

  <p>He flew the pigeon and watched it circle and then, as the boat drifted
  into the bank, slipped four loaded magazines into his pocket, two for each
  pistol, as the first of the bushmen dropped to the deck...</p>

  <p>"Let all these men be brought to me alive," had been K'belu's order,
  "especially the young man with the shining eye who is the son of Sandi."</p>

  <p>Miraculously, only one of the party was killed in that final rush of the
  little-men, and Bones marched through the forest at the head of a dejected
  escort. That night he was brought before the Ouda.</p>

  <p>"I see you, son of Sandi," said K'belu. "Now you know that we are a great
  people, for we have overcome your guns that say 'ha-ha-ha' and your terrible
  soldiers."</p>

  <p>He was extremely ugly, but not quite as ugly as the undressed little woman
  who danced by his side, snapping her stubby little fingers in an ecstasy of
  joy. For now the fine skin bed was very near at hand and the first of the
  lovers had looked at her meaningly.</p>

  <p>"O fool!" said Bones. "Where are they who have stood up against
  government? Do they not hang upon a tree until their bones slip through the
  rope? Sandi will hear and he will come and you will go to the place where the
  shadows of monkeys live."</p>

  <p>"Eat his heart!" screamed Asabo, prancing frantically. "Give me this high
  man and I will make him into three little people."</p>

  <p>Her husband pushed her aside ungently.</p>

  <p>"Sandi will never know," he said, and then he heard a wild squeak of fear,
  and the great crowd that surrounded them began to melt until only the
  prisoners, K'belu and his wife remained. Yet there was nothing to be seen,
  for the Houssas who were coming through the forest had painted their bayonets
  black that they might not reflect the light, and Sanders wore a dark coat
  over his khaki and was bareheaded. Even Bones did not see him till he came
  into the light of the fire.</p>

  <p>"O K'belu!" said Sanders, and the little bushman made a grimace.</p>

  <p>"First you will kill Tibbetti and then this chief and that, and lastly you
  will kill me," said Sanders with his cold mile. "Little man, what do you say
  that you do not die this night?"</p>

  <p>Presently K'belu found his voice.</p>

  <p>"Lord, how did you know these mysteries?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Women will talk," said Sanders cryptically, and looked round for the
  lokali that Asabo had rattled so joyously, sending out to the world the story
  of her husband's greatness.</p>

  <p>"Fortunately," said Sanders, as the Zaire went swiftly down the big river,
  "Asabo's message was relayed. Ahmet in the Isisi heard it and flew a pigeon,
  but I knew before. Hamilton wanted to come&mdash;but somebody had to stay
  behind."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Bones, with the memory of his grievance still upon him,
  "to put the jolly old cards in order."</p>

  <h2><a name="chap05"
     id="chap05">V. &mdash; THE SAINT</a></h2>

  <h3>First published as "Bones and the Saint" in <i>The Grand Magazine</i>,
  Vol. 49, Mar-Aug 1926</h3>

  <p class="first">FROM time to time there passed through Sanders's
  headquarters men and women who had devoted their lives to the well-being of
  native people. Sanders did not share the prejudice against missionaries
  common in Government circles; on the other hand he did not favour them,
  because they established, unconsciously, a new authority.</p>

  <p>"Lord," a new convert once asked him, "there is a new master here called
  Jesu-God, and if we do things that please Him we need not do things which
  please your lordship."</p>

  <p>"O man," said Sanders, "if you do not please me, you will not please Him,
  and I will come with my soldiers and you will be sorry, for He is my own God
  and I have known Him longer than you."</p>

  <p>An outrageous claim by every ethical test, but in the black lands which
  Sanders governed, eight hundred words form an extensive vocabulary, and there
  is no scope for the finer shades of definition.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Albert arrived one morning, and was not unexpected. Headquarters had
  forwarded a massive documentation concerning the lady; she was the daughter
  of a peer of the realm, the Honourable Cynthia Perthwell Albert,
  and&mdash;she had lived.</p>

  <p>Cynthia had been on the stage; Cynthia had been divorced; Cynthia had
  written a slim volume of scandalous memoirs; and eventually (the last hope of
  all whose meat and drink is publicity) it was announced that she was taking
  the veil. Unfortunately, at that time another popular figure in the social
  world decided to go into a convent, and Cynthia contradicted the report and
  announced that she had joined the Far Afield Missionary Society, and that
  henceforth she intended devoting her life to the heathen in his darkness.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Bones, "I know the dear old lady. She has pots of
  money&mdash;bless my soul, what a silly old josser she must be to go
  missionary!"</p>

  <p>He did not realise (nor, for the matter of that, did Cynthia) that in her
  heart had been born a great exaltation that was seven-tenths sincere&mdash;a
  desire for saintliness. Naturally, such a grand emotion could not be
  maintained at its highest level all the time, but at odd moments Cynthia,
  with the thought of reaching a plane of super&mdash;excellence which would
  endure beyond the limit of impulse, saw herself followed by adoring crowds of
  respectable natives, she imagined pilgrimages of native worshippers to her
  shrine (which she somehow managed to site in Westminster Abbey); and in her
  more ecstatic mood she canvassed the possibility of the Church going back to
  Rome, if only for long enough to procure canonisation for Saint Cynthia. In
  these spiritual periods Cynthia was very earnest indeed, and she was helped
  thereto by the character of the Founder and President of the Far Afield
  Mission, who was a very good old man and had the gift of making those with
  whom he talked feel almost as good. Cynthia, of course, had her lapses.</p>

  <p>She came to Headquarters with eight trunks, four suitcases and a
  morocco-leather dressing-bag, and she wore the beautiful white dress and
  helmet in which she had been photographed before she left her palatial home
  in Sunningdale. But the pre-martyr and saintly expression that appeared in
  the illustrated weeklies was conspicuously absent when Bones, gallantly
  wading into the sea to carry her from the surf-boat, stumbled and dropped her
  into the water.</p>

  <p>"How perfectly stupid of you&mdash;you've ruined my dress," she snapped.
  "The man would have carried me ashore without trouble. Why the hell did you
  interfere?"</p>

  <p>"Steady the buffs, dear old missionary lady," murmured the shocked Bones.
  "Children present, dear old Joan of Arc!"</p>

  <p>There were no children present except Bones, but, as he pointed out
  afterwards, there might have been.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;why were you so careless?"</p>

  <p>The Hon. Cynthia realised that she was not "in character" and adopted a
  meeker tone. She stood on the beach, shaking her soddened skirts, a picture
  of unsaintly annoyance. And, when she got to the Residency:</p>

  <p>"I think, Mr. Sanders, that at least you might have had a car or something
  at the beach to bring me here. It was terrible walking over that awful sand,
  and that wretched boy, with his 'dear old lady' this and 'dear old
  missionary' that, is simply insufferable."</p>

  <p>Sanders looked at her with patient interest. She was rather pretty, in a
  powdery, red-lipped way. Her features were good, her eyes were rather fine;
  she exhaled a faint and illusive fragrance.</p>

  <p>"What are your plans, Mrs. Albert?" he asked. "I understand that you are
  going into the back country and that you are taking over the work of Mrs.
  Klein."</p>

  <p>"I am not taking over anybody's work&mdash;I am joining her," said
  Cynthia.</p>

  <p>"Then I'm afraid you'll have to go to heaven," said Sanders
  good-humouredly. "Mrs. Klein died three months ago. She&mdash;er&mdash;met
  with an accident."</p>

  <p>Cynthia went pale.</p>

  <p>"They didn't tell me that," she said breathlessly. "Accident&mdash;?</p>

  <p>"To be exact, she was murdered," said Sanders calmly, and the fragrant
  lady caught hold of the table.</p>

  <p>"Murdered?"&mdash;hollowly.</p>

  <p>Sanders nodded.</p>

  <p>"The natives in that part are rather simple people. They loved her so much
  that, at the first rumour of her leaving, they killed her, as they explained,
  because they wanted her holy body with them."</p>

  <p>The society missionary found a difficulty in speaking.</p>

  <p>"They told me... quite safe..." she said at last. "Great heavens! I
  wouldn't dream of going to such an awful place!"</p>

  <p>"I think you had better go home," said Sanders bluntly. "A ship calls here
  next Monday&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not!" said the Honourable Cynthia.</p>

  <p>Go home! Be the laughing-stock of people like Julia Hawthill, who had been
  photographed in the beautiful habit of a novitiate and would probably still
  be in the Convent of Sacre Coeur (she arranged to stay at least three
  months), and brave the photographers and the paragraphists and the folk who
  would meet her at Ascot and say "Hallo, Cynthia! Thought you'd been eaten by
  cannibals"? It was not possible.</p>

  <p>"There must be a nice place where I can stay and&mdash;er&mdash;do My
  Work? Mr. Billberry said that the mission had a station at the&mdash;what do
  they call it? It begins with an 'I'?"</p>

  <p>"Isisi?" suggested Sanders. "Yes, I believe your people have a sub-station
  there. I'll fix it for you."</p>

  <p>The Isisi were at this time a well-behaved people&mdash;except in the
  matter of the Yellow Ghosts, and that Sanders, for the moment, was not taking
  too seriously. He sent Bones up-river in the Wiggle, and the message that
  came back was reassuring.</p>

  <p>The missionary was on the point of making one of his long tours in the
  forest, and would be away with his wife for three months. He placed his
  pleasant little house at Cynthia's disposal, together with lay workers and
  interpreters. To Cynthia he sent a long epistle full of words beginning with
  capitals, such as Faith, Sacrifice, Grace, and Glory. Cynthia read the letter
  twice to discover whether there was a bath-room in the house.</p>

  <p>Bones took her to the Field of her Labours.</p>

  <p>"What you've got to do, dear old miss," he said (amongst other things),
  "is to avoid getting your jolly old legs bitten by mosquitoes, take a tot of
  whisky every night at sundown, an' keep up your blessed old pecker."</p>

  <p>"I wish you wouldn't 'dear old miss' me," said Cynthia severely. "It is
  very impertinent."</p>

  <p>"Sorry, dear old missionary," murmured the prudent Bones.</p>

  <p>Cynthia did not like her new home, though the novelty of the surroundings
  was delightful. She spent two days photographing the ullage, and had herself
  photographed by a native lay preacher, surrounded by little children who wore
  no clothes and smelt queerly.</p>

  <p>The nights were the worst. In the daytime she could amuse herself with the
  camera and read the lessons in the thatched church, but the nights were
  awfully dark and still, and the Christian girl in the next room snored and
  talked in her sleep about her lover&mdash;one M'gara, the Akasava fisherman.
  Happily, Cynthia did not understand Bomongo and never knew that the scandals
  of Mayfair have a strong family likeness to the scandals of the Isisi River.
  For M'gara was a married man and no gentleman.</p>

  <p>Then came a new interest in life, for, just as she was getting very bored,
  Cynthia made a notable convert&mdash;Osaku, son of a great witch-doctor, and
  himself skilled in the arts of magic and necromancy. He was a tall man. "A
  noble-looking savage," Cynthia described him in her first letter home. "And
  so awfully nice. I gave him a cake of soap&mdash;one of those we bought at
  Pinier's in Paris&mdash;and now he simply haunts the place. Apparently this
  Sanders person has treated him abominably: threatened to hang him, and did
  actually kill poor Osaku's father. My dear, these natives simply worship me!
  They call me Mama, and I feel simply uplifted. There is a most awful
  bath-room at this wretched little hole, but the bed is comfortable. I'm
  coming home on leave in three months' time..."</p>

  <p>It was true that Sanders had threatened Osaku and had ill-treated his
  parent&mdash;who was a famous witch-man in his day.</p>

  <p>The position of a witch-doctor in the River Territories is not altogether
  a sinecure. In the early period of Sanders's commissionership there was a
  sort of convention of these Devil Men. They met in the light of a new moon on
  the Island of Skulls, which is near the Pool of Black Water, and they sent a
  message to Sanders asking for a tribute to their greatness, for in these
  times they were very haughty men, and chiefs and kings were in the hollow of
  their hands. Sanders sent a tribute: a long rope with a noose at the end that
  ran through a leather eye. And he directed, by his messenger, that the rope
  should be swung over the branch of a tree, and bade such as desired tribute
  to await his coming in the first hour of that night. When he arrived the
  meeting-place was deserted and the dangling rope swayed in the night wind
  about the grey ashes of their fires.</p>

  <p>Sometimes men become witch-doctors by reason of their hereditary right;
  sometimes they are just poor, mad folk who hear strange voices; sometimes
  they reach their status by cunning&mdash;Cheku, the Isisi man and father of
  Osaku, was one of these. He practised secret rites in the forest, enlisting
  in this manner recruits to the Leopards, that most dangerous of all secret
  societies, and when the order was stamped out he became Agent for the Yellow
  Ghosts, a society which had its origin in Nigeria and differed from the
  Leopards in the way of its killings.</p>

  <p>Bosambo, chief of the Ochori, having offended these Ghosts by his crude
  and brutal intrusion into one of their seances, was marked for death. In the
  middle of the night, when he slept, two men of the Isisi crept up from the
  river carrying a great lump of wet clay kneaded until it was wetly plastic.
  They went like shadows into his hut, and the stronger dropped the clay over
  his face and fell across him, whilst his companion lay heavily across his
  legs. By all reckoning Bosambo should have been dead in two minutes, but he
  had the strength of ten men...</p>

  <p>In the light of the outside fire stirred to a blaze, the chief of the
  Ochori gave judgment on the yellow-faced assassins.</p>

  <p>"Let them go back to their land," he said, and four of his guard took the
  prisoners to their canoe and paddled them to a deep hole in the river. Here
  they tied very heavy stones to their ankles and dropped them into the water,
  and that night there were two new shapes on the Ghost Mountains, where the
  spirits of the dead dwell eternally.</p>

  <p>Some news of this came to Sandi and he journeyed north, travelling night
  and day. His interview with Bosambo was brief; his stay in the village of
  Cheku was unpleasantly protracted.</p>

  <p>Day after day he sat in the palaver house smelling out ghosts; night after
  night the three palaver fires at the foot of the tiny hillock where the house
  was set, burnt till near the dawn, and in the end Sanders crooked his finger
  at the witch-man and that was the end of him.</p>

  <p>To Osaku, his son and successor, Sandi spoke.</p>

  <p>"I go back to my fine house at the River End," he said, "and you stay here
  alive. Now this is a saying of the river, which all men know and you best of
  all: 'Men who stand still do not step on thorns.' Beware how you move, Osaku,
  lest you go the way of your father."</p>

  <p>For the space of a year Osaku, the son of Cheku, stepped gingerly. He
  prophesied&mdash;but there was no harm in it. Sanders had news of wonders
  promised and fulfilled; of great shoals of fish indicated and found; of sons
  promised and born; of storms foretold that burst in due course; and only when
  Osaku prophesied death, and death came, did he interfere.</p>

  <p>He sent for Osaku to come to him at the village of K'fori, where he was
  holding a marriage palaver, and when the tall, good-looking young man stood
  before him, Sanders spoke.</p>

  <p>"O Prophet, I see you!" said he. "Let Sandi, who is your father and
  mother, look wisely into tomorrow. This I see, Osaku: on a certain day you
  shall foretell the death of your enemy, and lo! in the morning he is dead!
  Yet before nightfall comes Tibbetti with soldiers, and they take Osaku into
  the deep woods where only the monkeys live, and there they hang him by the
  neck, as they hanged his father. Do I prophesy well, Osaku?"</p>

  <p>Osaku shuffled his feet and wriggled his toes, and went home hating the
  man with the horrible blue eyes. For the space of two moons he considered his
  position, and at the end of that time he borrowed half a dozen paddlers from
  his chief and friend and went down to Headquarters. He arrived three days
  before the coming of Cynthia.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said he, "I have thought many strange thoughts. You are the father
  and mother of your people; you carry us in your arms and make us very happy.
  Now, lord, I have been gifted by devils so that my bright eyes see all that
  will come with the sun. And because I love you, Sandi, I will speak to all
  the people who listen and believe me, and tell them how beautiful you are.
  And I will tell them that if they are good men and pay their taxes, and do
  not take their spears to one another, they will be very happy, their crops
  shall swell, and the fish shall live in their waters."</p>

  <p>"That will be a very good palaver," said Sanders, waiting for what would
  follow.</p>

  <p>"But, lord, there will be no profit for Osaku in this," the seer went on,
  "since men do not give rich presents for the pleasures that are shared by
  all. Now this I ask, Sandi, that you shall remit all my taxes and give me
  presents of cloth and other wonderful things&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Go back to your village, Osaku," Sanders broke in unpleasantly. "I reward
  men, not by giving but by not taking. This is the way of governments. And
  because I have left you your life and your legs free from chains, I have
  rewarded you well. This palaver is finished."</p>

  <p>Sanders allowed his wrathful visitor two days' grace to rest his paddlers,
  and in that time Osaku's brain was busy with schemes of vengeance.</p>

  <p>Particularly was he interested in the peculiar behaviour of a very tall
  lieutenant of Houssas who wore a shining glass in his eye and was reputedly
  the son of Sandi.</p>

  <p>Every morning after his bath, Lieutenant Tibbetts walked down to the beach
  to view the progress of his foster child. It lay in the hot sand, a large and
  queerly-shaped egg. On such a morning, when he was replacing the sand, he saw
  the egg crack and a tiny yellow snout push through into the open air.
  Fascinated, he watched the tiny lizard form creep out and lie palpitating
  violently in the warm rays of the morning sun.</p>

  <p>Very carefully he picked up the little creature in his handkerchief. It
  squirmed feebly, but in triumph he carried his child up the Residency steps
  and laid it before his superior.</p>

  <p>"Basil has arrived&mdash;it's a boy," said Bones.</p>

  <p>Captain Hamilton looked and shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Take the beastly thing off the table&mdash;good Lord&mdash;crocodiles for
  breakfast!"</p>

  <p>"Dear old Ham," said Bones earnestly, "don't despise the humble but
  necessary croc. He's human, dear old Ham, the same as me; he's one of
  nature's artful little tricks. Ham&mdash;the same as you. Basil will prove
  that with careful an' tender nursin', even a jolly old simoonian&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'Silurian' is the word you want."</p>

  <p>"Whatever it is, can become attached to his owner. Basil will follow me
  round an' sleep outside my door at nights. Ham. That young feller
  &mdash;here, wake up!"</p>

  <p>The small reptile lay very still and pale; the heavings of his
  semi-transparent sides had grown imperceptible.</p>

  <p>"Got any brandy, dear old sir?" asked Bones in alarm.</p>

  <p>"Drown it," said the callous Hamilton. "If you want to revive it
  &mdash;sing to it. One of those old crocodile lullabies."</p>

  <p>Bones seized the milk jug and splashed its contents into a saucer. He
  thrust the sharp snout of the dying crocodile into the white fluid. The
  crocodile wriggled convulsively, opened his mouth, squawked and, whipping its
  head round, suddenly gripped Bones's finger between two rows of needle-like
  teeth.</p>

  <p>"Ouch!" yelled Bones. "You low little viper&mdash;gerrout!"</p>

  <p>He shook his hand free and the tiny beast fell on the table, facing Bones
  with open mouth, its sides heaving healthily.</p>

  <p>"By gum, dear old Ham&mdash;bit the hand that fed him! You naughty old
  insect! Into the river you go!"</p>

  <p>When he came back from his mission of disinheritance: "If you want to
  carry crocodiles around. Bones, do you mind not using the sugar-tongs?" asked
  Hamilton gently.</p>

  <p>"Drew blood, dear old sir." Bones was quivering with indignation. "After
  what I did for him!"</p>

  <p>"Did he drown?" asked Hamilton, his eyes glued on the month-old newspaper
  he was reading.</p>

  <p>"No, sir; the dirty little dog swam like a&mdash;a frog, sir. I hope he
  gets into serious trouble."</p>

  <p>Osaku had witnessed the casting off of the foster child. Squatting on the
  edge of the river with his paddlers, he saw the wriggling shape plop into the
  river, and an idea began to form in his mind. What is prophecy but
  inspiration? And what is inspiration but an automatic sense of cause and
  effect? There was one more crocodile in the river, one more slinking shape to
  pull down women who go to the river in the morning to draw water. A long time
  after Osaku had departed, disquieting news came down the river. Osaku was
  prophesying mightily and the Yellow Ghosts had appeared in the Akasava and
  the Isisi.</p>

  <p>He foretold that there would come a great rain and the skies would spout
  water for three days, and at the end of that time it would cease. And then,
  when the new moon came, there would be a flood and the world would be covered
  with water, and out of the water would come a multitude of crocodiles, so
  many that they covered the land, and not even the little monkeys in the trees
  would escape them, nor the birds that flew. And all this would happen because
  Sandi hated the people and had filled the river with the yellow horrors that
  bark at night.</p>

  <p>Sanders heard the story, stacked wood in the foredeck of the Zaire and
  kept steam, ready for an instant departure.</p>

  <p>"All this," said Hamilton bitterly, "arises out of your infernal
  experiment in crocodile incubation."</p>

  <p>Bones closed his eyes patiently.</p>

  <p>"Be fair, dear old Ham," he pleaded. "Did I incubate the rain&mdash;I ask
  you, dear old Solomon? Be honest. Ham. Don't put everything on to poor old
  Bones. Basil was a disappointment. They happen in every family, dear old
  captain and adjutant."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't be surprised," said Sanders thoughtfully, "if that wretched
  little crocodile of yours was the cause of the trouble, Bones. The only thing
  we can do is to sit tight and hope that a miracle doesn't happen, or, if it
  happens, that it doesn't extend. And in the meantime, be ready to withdraw
  that wretched Albert woman from the Isisi."</p>

  <p>"What miracle are you expecting, sir?" asked Hamilton in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Crocodiles," said Sanders laconically. "It's a queer coincidence that
  Bosambo notified me this morning that every creek in the Ochori seems alive
  with them!"</p>

  <p>Hamilton stared at him. Bones collapsed into a chair.</p>

  <p>"Not Basil?" he said weakly. "Little Basil hasn't had time to raise a
  family..."</p>

  <p>"It happened before, about twelve years ago, according to ports. The
  Colonial Office zoologist has a theory that there is a species of croc who
  buries himself in the mud and only makes an appearance once in a blue moon
  &mdash;I've dug out these fellows myself, buried twelve feet under the
  riverbed and very much annoyed to be awakened from their sleep."</p>

  <p>That very night the phenomenon he dreaded was demonstrated at the very
  doors of the Residency. It was two o'clock in the morning and the moon showed
  fitfully, when Abdulla, the sentry before the guard's hut, saw something
  moving stealthily across the parade ground and challenged. At the sound of
  his voice the creature remained still for a long time, and the sentry decided
  that it was a moon shadow he had seen, until he saw it move again, this time
  towards him and there came to his sensitive nostrils a faint scent of musk.
  His Lee-Metford went up immediately.</p>

  <p>Sanders heard the sound of the shot, and came out on to the stoep,
  revolver in hand. He heard Bones's high-pitched voice speaking from the door
  of his hut, but Sanders was too far away to hear the conversation.</p>

  <p>"What is it, sir?" Hamilton was at the Commissioner's side, his rifle
  under his arm.</p>

  <p>"I thought I heard a shot fired. Something's wrong&mdash;do you hear
  Bones?"</p>

  <p>They heard Bones at that moment; a raucous squawk of fear, then, from the
  direction of his hut, came the staccato rattle of his automatic.</p>

  <p>"Good God! Look!" gasped Sanders.</p>

  <p>A gap in the clouds sent a sudden flood of moonlight over the parade
  ground. Three&mdash;four&mdash;five, he counted; great lizard shapes that ran
  swiftly towards the river. Hamilton fired, and one of the things jerked
  convulsively, uttered a bellowing roar of pain, crawled a little farther and
  lay still. As it did so, the largest of the fugitives lashed round and,
  without warning, came straight for the Residency steps at an incredible pace.
  Hamilton and the Commissioner fired together; fired again, apparently without
  effect. It was not till the long head was thrusting up towards the stoep that
  the third shot took effect.</p>

  <p>"Jumping Moses!" breathed Hamilton.</p>

  <p>By this time lights were showing in all the huts. The guard were firing at
  something they could not see, and, jamming another cartridge into the chamber
  of his rifle, Hamilton sprinted across the parade ground towards Bones's
  hut.</p>

  <p>He found his junior sprawled on the ground, and at first he thought he was
  dead, and then that his leg was broken. Two Houssas hauled Bones into the
  Residency, and laid him flat on the floor.</p>

  <p>"The devil must have caught him with its tail," said Hamilton, as he
  forced brandy between the clenched teeth.</p>

  <p>Bones opened his eves.</p>

  <p>"Not Basil," he murmured. "Poor little Basil... !"</p>

  <p>"Wake up, you poultry farmer!" snarled Hamilton, and Bones sat upright,
  rubbed his leg, and stared around.</p>

  <p>"It was not Basil," he said solemnly. "I'd like to make a statement before
  I die, dear old sir, exonerating poor little Basil..."</p>

  <p>It was a quarter of an hour before his scattered senses were put in order,
  and he had little to tell that was informative. He had heard the shot, rushed
  out of his hut, and had seen two horrible eyes glittering at him, and had
  fired. And that was all that he remembered.</p>

  <p>When daylight came there arrived three canoes from villages in the
  neighbourhood, with stories of disaster and murder. Huts had been broken and
  entered; women and children and old men had disappeared; but the greatest
  casualties had occurred in the little compound where the village kept its
  edible dogs. The Residency area, fortunately, had suffered no loss.</p>

  <p>"If this sort of thing occurs here," said Sanders, worried, "what is
  happening on the Upper River?"</p>

  <p>He was standing on the deck of the Zaire looking out over the black and
  swollen sea. The river was alive with crocodiles; their ripples showed at
  every turn. Sanders gathered the families into the thick woods that lay at
  the extreme centre of the little peninsula on which the Residency stood.</p>

  <p>"Have fires lit on the parade ground tonight," he gave orders. "Hamilton,
  you had better remain here in charge. I'll take Bones to the Upper
  River."</p>

  <p>At eleven o'clock that morning the Zaire set out on its trip. The river
  was deserted; no human craft was in sight, which was not remarkable, since
  the waters were running at between eight and nine knots; and his progress was
  a slow one. He steamed all night, stopping only to replenish his fuel at the
  village of Igebi. Here he began to realise the full extent of the disaster.
  The village was a ruin; scarcely a hut stood squarely on its foundations. The
  night before, a trembling headman told him, "all the crocodiles in the world"
  had come up out of the water, and what damage they had done he was not able
  to say because his people, except his own son, had fled to the woods. The
  casualties had been heavy. He told stories which would have sickened the
  average man, and Sanders listened with seeming impassivity, loaded up his
  wood and continued his journey.</p>

  <p>All the way up, six Houssa marksmen had sat in the bow, shooting at every
  crocodile they saw. Once, rounding a bend of the river, they came upon a
  long, narrow bank of sand, covered with the reptiles. Bones got the Hotchkiss
  gun into action and sent two shrapnel shells bursting over the wriggling
  mass. In a second the sand strip was clear, save for two lame shapes.</p>

  <p>He tied up at the village of the Lesser Isisi and found it deserted. There
  was ghastly evidence in the streets of the overnight raid.</p>

  <p>Sanders thought of the missionary, and went white.</p>

  <p>"Lord, that Mama has gone," said the man. "I went by the forest path to
  her hut and I saw nothing but a dead woman who had been speared&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Speared?" snarled Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Somebody killed her," said the trembling man. "Who knows what devils walk
  on such a night?"</p>

  <p>The missionary hut was a mile from the town, and when Sanders got there he
  found nothing but a dead girl at the door of Cynthia's room. A devil had
  walked that night more potent than the lizards that came out of the
  water.</p>

  <p>When the rains continued to fall, Osaku had grown frightened, and called
  together his four disciples.</p>

  <p>"Now this is the end of the world," he said; "for Sandi will know that I
  have brought this rain, and if the Terrible Ones follow, then Sandi will come
  and there will be an end to me, and to all of us who have made this thing by
  our magic. And if we hang for such a little thing, what shall happen if we do
  other deeds? For no man has more than one life, and if he kills one or kills
  all the world, no worse can come to him."</p>

  <p>In this long-winded way did he paraphrase the saying that they might as
  well be hung for a sheep as a lamb.</p>

  <p>"Let us take the Jesu-mama to a certain island in the lake where Sandi
  never goes, and will not be wise to look. For this woman loves me and has
  given me wonderful things, but because she fears Sandi she turns her face
  from me. And you shall bring whoever has gladdened your bed, and we will live
  happily and teach one another magic."</p>

  <p>His followers, themselves alarmed by the downpour, went their way.</p>

  <p>Cynthia was lying down in her hut, listening to the ceaseless drumming of
  the rain, and wondering how long it would be before Sanders could send a
  launch for her, when she heard voices in the outer room and the sound of a
  squeal. She rose hastily as the grass door was pushed aside. Osaku said
  something in a language she did not understand, but his beckoning hand spoke
  all tongues.</p>

  <p>As she came trembling into the dark outer room, she trod on something that
  yielded to her foot, and she screamed&mdash;there was blood on Osaku's spear,
  for the girl who snored, as she dreamt of her fisherman lover, snored no
  more.</p>

  <p>They passed into the teeming rain, Osaku's hand on her arm, and she was
  thrust into a narrow canoe that wobbled horribly. The reeking paddler sent
  the craft along the bank and, turning abruptly, drove straight into the
  narrow creek which leads to the lake. Dawn brought them to the wide waters
  and to a small island. It was not the destination that Osaku had intended,
  but the canoe was half full of rain water, and though two men baled
  continuously they could not keep pace with the downpour.</p>

  <p>"Here we stay. Mama," said Osaku, and dragged the half-dead girl to land.
  She was stiff and numb, frozen with terror.</p>

  <p>Under the dripping trees, they plaited her a rough covering of grass, and
  under this she dozed and swooned throughout the last day of the rains. The
  lake had risen, and there were certain disturbances which troubled Osaku and
  his companions, for the rain-pitted surface of the waters was laced with
  significant ripples, and once he saw two shining crocodiles waddle out of the
  lake and lie down on the shore. Now a crocodile, when he takes to land, keeps
  his snout pointed to the water, ready to dive at the least alarm&mdash;but
  these great reptiles pointed their wicked noses to the land. Osaku had a
  thought.</p>

  <p>"It seems," he said, "that the Mama has a greater magic than we. I have
  heard of such things from the God-men, and now I know that it is true; the
  yellow ones are their ju-ju&mdash;did not Tibbetti hold one in his hand? If
  we do this Mama no harm they will go away. Presently we will go to the big
  island where they cannot reach us, and then we will do what we wish."</p>

  <p>There were ten people on his islet, which was growing smaller as the
  waters rose. Each of the four had brought his companion&mdash;and only one of
  these had come willingly. Through the haze of her sick dreams Cynthia heard
  the wails and lamentations of the rest and shivered.</p>

  <p>In the night she was awakened by a horrible sound and flew out into the
  open. The dawn was near at hand, and the crescent of the morning moon hung
  low.</p>

  <p>Screams and gruff, throaty barkings; the flogging of grass and bush by
  terrible tails.</p>

  <p>Sanders picked up the trail from a half-crazed fisherman, and the Zaire
  came to the island with the first rays of the sun. Bones, gun in hand, leapt
  ashore. There was no evidence of horror&mdash;nothing but trodden bushes and
  the broken saplings, with a trace of blood here and there.</p>

  <p>Cynthia was standing alone, her frail figure rigid, a quiet smile on her
  face.</p>

  <p>"... they did not touch me because I am a saint... you realise that, of
  course, Mr. Tibbetts? It was rather horrid seeing them pulled into the water,
  but the wretched things simply did not touch me at all! I wish you would send
  a paragraph to the Morning Post&mdash;Saint Cynthia!"</p>

  <p>She smiled weakly into his face, her lips trembling, her eyes set in a
  dreadful stare.</p>

  <p>"The natives adore me&mdash;don't forget that, please. And would you tell
  my chauffeur that I'm quite ready to go home?" And then she fell into his
  arms, and he carried her to the Zaire.</p>

  <p>Quite a lot of people think that the Honourable Cynthia is still in the
  Dark Land, and in a sense they are right. But it is in the dark land of what
  is euphemistically called a Nursing Home in the north of London, where
  Cynthia sits with her quiet smile and her staring eyes and talks familiarly
  of saints and crocodiles.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap06"
     id="chap06">VI. &mdash; THE MAN WHO HATED SHEFFIELD</a></h2>

  <h3>First published as "Bones and the Gold-Seeker" in <i>The Grand
  Magazine</i>, Vol. 48, Sep 1925-Feb 1926</h3>

  <p class="first">BEYOND the Forest of Happy Dreams, which is a pestilential
  marsh, beautiful to see but deadly to traverse, lie the hunting grounds of
  the Isisi people; and beyond that again, the outliers of the N'gombi, a tribe
  which is sometimes called the Lesser N'gombi and sometimes the N'gombi Isisi,
  which means very much the same thing.</p>

  <p>Here, in the depths of the primeval forest, unexploited by any save the
  hunters and the folk who collect rubber, lived, out of contact with their
  neighbours, and terribly jealous of interference, a certain sub-tribe who
  were called the Bald Men of I'fubi. They made no wars, stole neither goats
  nor women, lived without salt, and existed without any offence to any.</p>

  <p>Once a year came Sanders, toiling through the forest, on his annual visit
  to these wayward children of his; but when he sat in palaver, to hear the
  accumulated grievances of the year, there was nothing to be told except that
  some luckless man of the Isisi or the Greater N'gombi had trespassed on their
  reserves or had killed their monkeys. Of private quarrels he never heard; he
  asked few questions and suspected much.</p>

  <p>A rumour had reached him of a man of the tribe who had beaten his wife
  with great cruelty, and had defied his chief; but when Sanders came after,
  and expected to hear charges against the rebel, none was laid. And when, most
  discreetly, he asked what had happened to the man, they told him airily that
  he had died of the sickness mongo, and pointed out his shallow grave, where
  the torn shreds of his linen fluttered feebly and the broken cooking-pots of
  his house were scattered around. Also they showed him the place where his hut
  had been, and now all that Sanders could see was a drunken roof, half hidden
  by the elephant grass, and very wisely he did not pursue his inquiry any
  further. The "sickness mongo" might mean anything from beri-beri to the
  bright, curved executioner's knife which hung everlastingly at the entrance
  of the old chief's hut.</p>

  <p>These Bald Men&mdash;and it is a curious fact that the heads even of the
  youth of the tribe shone like polished ebony&mdash;gave no trouble; carried
  no spears to the killing of their neighbours; paid their taxes regularly;
  were clean and industrious; and if they practised secret rites and concocted
  strange medicants, such as had never been heard of by any other people of the
  river, there was no blood-letting, so far as was known, and they served a
  most useful purpose, in that they stood, in their jealousy, as guardians of
  the Pans which stretched behind the forest, an unnatural plain, innocent of
  bush or tree for forty square miles. It was a legend amongst all the
  Europeans of the coast that the Pans were rich in alluvial gold. Certainly
  Government never sought to test the truth of this, putting in the balance,
  against such a discovery, the certainty of an influx of most undesirable
  people, who follow every discovery of gold.</p>

  <p>There came into this quiet land a white man, who called himself Odwall. It
  had once been Obenwitsch, but, for reasons of his own, he had anglicised
  himself, taken off the beard he had been in the habit of wearing, and thus,
  outwardly changed, strayed into the region of the Pans, which are
  approachable only through the country of the Bald Men. These quiet souls, who
  believed that there were only three white men in the world, received Mr.
  Odwall with the profound respect and dazed wonder which a church convention
  might offer to a second, and hitherto unsuspected, Archbishop of
  Canterbury.</p>

  <p>He sat down and talked to them in their own language, and they gave a
  great feast and a dance of girls, and they told him of their mystery, and why
  their heads were bald; but in this he was not greatly interested. Nor was he
  especially thrilled when old Ch'uga, chief of the village, told him secretly,
  in a whisper and in the darkest comer of his hut, that a new herb had been
  found which cured madness. For the Bald Men are very wise in the use of
  herbs, and because of this they are bald, as you shall learn.</p>

  <p>Tactfully and gradually, he led the talk round to the subject of the Pans
  and the yellow dust that could be washed from the dark earth; but Ch'uga
  shook his head at the first word of it.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said he, a trifle shocked, "these things we do not talk about,
  because of Sandi our father, nor do we dig into the earth, for that also is
  forbidden. And when strange men come and make little holes in the ground, we
  fight them with our spears and they run away."</p>

  <p>Mr. Obenwitsch (we had better call him Odwall) was terribly interested but
  asked no further questions. He had, he calculated, at least three months to
  get better acquainted with the chief, and he could afford to bide his
  time.</p>

  <p>It was unfortunate for him that, the following morning, as he strolled
  through the tree-fringed village street, he met another white man, who walked
  out of the forest, followed by six red-tarboshed soldiers. Mr. Odwall did not
  swoon; he made a little grimace which might have been mistaken for a smile,
  and touched the rim of his none-too-clean helmet.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Commissioner," he said. "My name's Odwall&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your name is Obenwitsch," said Sanders, with his hard little smile.
  "Three years ago I had the satisfaction of kicking you out of this country,
  and I have an idea that I'm going to repeat that process, but this time, I
  think, the kick will be harder."</p>

  <p>Mr. Odwall was nearly a head taller than the dapper Commissioner; he was
  heavily built and something of a rough fighter; but he took the threat
  meekly, and it was not only the presence of the soldiers that restrained
  him.</p>

  <p>"You're in reserved territory without a permit," said Sanders. "I'd like
  to see your baggage, and that may not be all."</p>

  <p>The baggage, which consisted of a weather-worn grip, was brought from the
  chief's hut (all the Bald Men standing round, clasping their sides anxiously
  and wondering what was toward). Sanders opened the grip and turned over its
  contents. There was a quart flask of rye whisky, and this he smelt,
  afterwards turning the contents upon the ground.</p>

  <p>"You're carrying spirits in a prohibited area," he said briefly, "and I
  shall commit you to prison with hard labour for six months."</p>

  <p>"See here, Sanders, you're acting a little arbitrarily&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can go quietly or you can go in irons," interrupted Sanders. "I won't
  argue with you."</p>

  <p>Mr. Obenwitsch went down the river, a prisoner under escort to
  Headquarters, and forthwith was committed to prison.</p>

  <p>Sanders did not explain to the Bald Men why he had taken his
  fellow-countryman away, for it was his business to keep up the end of the
  European race, and Mr. Odwall knew him well enough to be certain of his
  reticence. He served his six months and was deported to England, for he was a
  British subject. But there was in his heart no malice towards Sanders, for
  Walter Odwall was an habitual breaker of the law, and such men respect
  authority.</p>

  <p>He came to London with enough money to hire a flat in Jermyn Street and to
  arrange with a high-class stationer for certain printing. For six months he
  had sat in prison, planning and re-planning, and his scheme was complete in
  all respects save one, and this deficiency could easily be remedied. He
  called to him a financier.</p>

  <p>He had met Mr. Wilberry in one of those social capillaries which are
  erroneously described as night clubs. Capillaries indeed, for here the poison
  gas of spurious Bohemianism intermingles with the good red blood of commerce,
  with disastrous effects. Mr. Wilberry was a well-to-do manufacturer whose
  chief characteristic was that he hated Sheffield. His hatred was such an
  obsession with him that he would have gone a hundred miles out of his way to
  avoid the town. When he wrote to the manager of his factory (which was
  indubitably in Sheffield) he had the envelope addressed by his
  secretary&mdash;the word was so hateful that he could not write it.</p>

  <p>He was not only a manufacturer, but an experimental chemist, having taken
  a very high science degree, and his hobby and preoccupation was a new kind of
  steel which was to revolutionise the trade. If the truth be told, he was a
  better business man than a scientist, and when, at the cost of a hundred
  thousand pounds, he produced in triumph a steel which was at once stainless
  and malleable, and offered Sheffield the privilege (in exchange for a small
  royalty which a disinterested statistician calculated would bring him in
  about three millions a year) of manufacturing this super-article, Sheffield
  was at first interested, then sceptical; applied tests, with unfortunate
  results, and the end of it was that the Sheffield manufacturers in council
  assembled, and aided and supported by their technical experts, spoke
  slightingly of Wilberry Steel, refused either to purchase or to manufacture
  it, and there the matter finished, in so far as they were concerned.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wilberry never forgave Sheffield; he loathed Sheffield with a loathing
  beyond the understanding of any who have not seen the child of their dreams
  massacred by cruel and ruthless hands. He sold his estate in the
  neighbourhood of the hated town; would have closed down his extensive works,
  only he was a business man, and that would have been an unbusinesslike thing
  to do; and settled in Surrey with a large laboratory, where he employed any
  scientific young gentleman who held the same view about Wilberry Steel as he
  held.</p>

  <p>Odwall had marked this gentleman for exploitation. He knew little or
  nothing about steel, but whilst he was in prison he had had the advantage of
  reading Volume XIV of the jail's encyclopaedia, and a careful study of the
  article on iron told him that no story he might tell of an ore-field in the
  Territories would arouse the least enthusiasm in the bosom of Mr. Wilberry.
  For iron must be found near coal, and there must be easy transportation.</p>

  <p>In his stuffy little sitting-room overlooking Jermyn Street he expanded
  his scheme.</p>

  <p>"Gold interests everybody," he said, "it interests you, Mr. Wilberry; it
  interests the boy in the street..."</p>

  <p>He proceeded to tell the story of the Pans and his audience was
  impressed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wilberry was a moist, red-faced man who smoked large cigars and wore
  white spats and a diamond ring. Smallish eyes and a little black moustache
  complete the description. He was very rich and very sceptical, until Mr.
  Odwall showed him a little bag filled with dull yellow grains.</p>

  <p>"I managed to wash out a bucketful of dirt, and that is what I got," he
  said impressively.</p>

  <p>The interested financier did not ask how it came about it Mr. Odwall had
  succeeded in smuggling his find through the rigorous searchings which are
  part of prison discipline. If he had asked, he would have been told an
  elaborate lie, for the gold was bought from a man in Dakka on the homeward
  voyage.</p>

  <p>"I don't mind putting a couple of thousand into it," said Mr. Wilberry.
  "Those thick-headed swine of Sheffield have almost ruined me, and some day,
  my boy, I'm going to get back on 'em! I'd give half a million to twist the
  blighters!"</p>

  <p>His statement did not accord with his protestations of poverty, but Odwall
  was not the type of man who boggled at an inconsistency.</p>

  <p>His plan was a simple one.</p>

  <p>"There's a kid officer out there," he said, "who would fall for anything
  with a tale to it. In June, Sanders goes up to the Ochori for his palavers
  with the northern chiefs, and he'll take Captain Hamilton with him." He
  explained Hamilton's position and identity. "This time I'll have three
  months' clear run of the Territory, and if I get on the right side of this
  kid Tibbetts I'll have the claims staked and registered before Sanders is
  back."</p>

  <p>"Does Tibbetts know you?"</p>

  <p>"Not from a crow. He was away when Sanders brought me down-river, and he
  wasn't in the Territory when I was trading there. Leave it to me!"</p>

  <p>Bones was surprised at nothing except the inability of his superior
  officer to appreciate his undoubted musical gifts. But the letter from "Mr.
  Walter Bagen" was so unexpected and so unusual of character that Lieutenant
  Tibbetts of the King's Houssas spent a whole hour blessing his own soul.
  Nevertheless, he lost no time in replying.</p>

  <p>"Dear Sir," he wrote, "I have the honnour to acknowledge the receit of
  your leter your letter. Of the iyh ultimus. I thank you also for refereing
  reffering to me as (a great authiroty authroity authoritey)"&mdash;Bones had
  never solved the mystery of the inverted comma&mdash;"on the subject of
  archeology." (He got this one right because he copied it letter by letter
  from his correspondent's typewritten epistle.) "I will certainley take a note
  of anything annything unusual in the way of Roman remains Roman remains
  evedence of early civvilisation et cet et cet. I thank you for illecting me a
  Fellow of the Central African Arkilogicle Society" (this time he wrote the
  word from memory) "and anything I can do to help foreword the great course of
  Arch of the Society you can depend on me doing. Trusting you are well,
  Sincerely, A. tibbetts, Lt., F.C.A.A.S."</p>

  <p>At tiffin, Bones mentioned his new honour very casually.</p>

  <p>"Fellow of the what?" asked Hamilton, his dark face screwed up
  inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Archi&mdash;um&mdash;you know, dear old officer... fossils an' things."
  Bones coughed and looked serious and important. "I shouldn't be a bit
  surprised if I didn't find something&mdash;a dina&mdash;um&mdash;one of those
  jolly old birds that used to fly around in prehistoric days. Ham, when you
  were a child, so to speak. And the dinky little ich&mdash;
  something&mdash;you find his bones almost anywhere. An' Roman
  remains&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Arc you going to write a lot of slush about these things?" asked Captain
  Hamilton coarsely.</p>

  <p>Bones raised his eyebrows and looked hurt. "I only ask," said Hamilton,
  "because I've had a sarcastic letter from the Accountant-General, who wants
  to know how many 'Ts' there are in 'flannel'&mdash;I gather that he has been
  studying your store report."</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbetts fixed his monocle more firmly in his eye.</p>

  <p>"I usually use three, but there may be four. Ham," he said, with gentle
  reproach. "The point is, flannel shirts have nothin' to do with
  archy&mdash;you know the word."</p>

  <p>The essay on "Roman Fosils and Other Articals of Ancient Origoin" has
  never seen the light, because Mr. Bagen, whose other name was Odwall, was not
  really interested in archaeology, no matter how it was spelt, and the Society
  had no existence, except on the notepaper he had printed for the purpose of
  conferring the Fellowship upon Bones. The letter which came back, and which
  was headed in heavily embossed type:</p>

  <p>"The Institute of the Central Africa Archaeological Society, 943, Jermyn
  Street. President: The Duke of&mdash;&mdash;Secretary: Walter S. Bagen,
  F.C.A.A.S." acknowledged Bones's essay, "which will be printed in the
  Proceedings of the Society," and informed him:</p>

  <p>"It is the intention of the Society to send a small party of scientists to
  the Coast in the near future, and an effort will be made, either by His Grace
  the President, or by the writer, to call and offer you the Society's
  congratulations upon your admirable contribution to our knowledge of an
  obscure and fascinating subject."</p>

  <p>It was on a hot day in June that the representative of the Central African
  Archasological Society walked slowly up the beach, where he had been landed
  from a surf-boat, a prayer on his lips that nothing had happened to interfere
  with Mr. Sanders's departure. Mr. Odwall wore white duck, a white helmet, his
  shoes were white&mdash;he was in his person an illustration of scientific
  purity. His heavy horn-rimmed glasses, no less than the volume he carried
  under his arm, gave him a grave and studious appearance.</p>

  <p>"Sandi he no lib, sah," said the Houssa sergeant who met him half-way, and
  Mr. Odwall's mind was relieved of a heavy burden, "Militini he no lib, sah:
  he go long time up-river. Mistah Tibbetti you see um, sah?"</p>

  <p>Odwall spoke Coast Arabic very well; he preferred for the moment to be a
  stranger to the land and to its many vernaculars.</p>

  <p>Bones was lying on a long chair on the stoep, his large feet elevated to
  the rails. He scrambled up at the sight of the visitor.</p>

  <p>"Bless my soul, dear old secretary!" he gasped, when the honour which was
  being done to him was revealed. "Never had the slightest idea you were
  coming&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was a little incoherent. Mr. Odwall gathered that, if news of his
  coming had been sent ahead, there would have been a band to meet him.</p>

  <p>Over tiffin Bones grew archaeological.</p>

  <p>"There are jolly old places in this country nobody has ever explored," he
  said. "Roman remains! There's a sort of viaduct up in the I'fubi&mdash;you
  know, sir, a sort of bridge that water runs over&mdash;horribly Roman! And
  there's no end of"&mdash;Bones manipulated his hands convulsively&mdash;"a
  kind of... I don't know what the jolly old arch... what the word is for it
  ... it's a sort of well arrangement&mdash;an' yet it isn't a well, if you
  understand, dear old sir... it's a sort of wall... not exactly a
  wall&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I quite understand," said Mr. Odwall gravely; "it's what we call an
  odalisque."</p>

  <p>"That's it!" said Bones. "You've got the word I've been tryin' to think
  of."</p>

  <p>That evening Mr. Odwall put forward a tentative plan.</p>

  <p>"Ye&mdash;es," said Bones, but with no great heartiness. "You could go up,
  of course&mdash;I'd have to ask the Commissioner."</p>

  <p>"I have a permit from the Colonial Office," suggested Mr. Odwall.</p>

  <p>He possessed nothing of the sort, but he had rightly surmised that in the
  circumstances he would not be asked to show any such document.</p>

  <p>Bones was relieved.</p>

  <p>"If you have that, dear old Archi&mdash;um&mdash;why, of course, you can
  go. I'd love to come with you, but I'm sort of stuck here till Mr. Sanders
  returns."</p>

  <p>Odwall hired paddlers the next morning, loaded his kit in the centre of
  the canoe and, himself comfortably ensconced under a palm-leaf roof, he left
  on his journey. In seven days he landed at the nearest point to the Pans and
  made his way through the forest. On the twelfth day he reached the village of
  the Bald Men and was effusively welcomed.</p>

  <p>For the greater part of a week he sat down in the village, spending most
  of his days wandering in the desolation of the Pans&mdash;but everywhere he
  went the old chief accompanied him.</p>

  <p>"Lord, this is a bad place to go," said the old man; "for there are ghosts
  and terrible ju-jus hiding in the ground. Also it is the word of Sandi our
  lord, that no white man shall walk here because of the evil which will
  follow. Come with me into the green woods and I will show you a little flower
  that gives men great courage if it is picked by the light of the moon and
  boiled in a big pot..."</p>

  <p>Mr. Odwall had no need for such a stimulant. The dope he wanted lay in the
  black earth.</p>

  <p>One night, when his stay had lasted nearly a fortnight and he had, by the
  exercise of his ingenuity, secured and washed a bucket of earth, without,
  however, discovering the slightest trace of gold, the old chief paid a visit
  to the hut, at the door of which Mr. Odwall sat, moodily surveying the
  domestic life of the village.</p>

  <p>"Master," he said in his secretive way, "because you are a friend of Sandi
  I will give you a great treasure."</p>

  <p>He looked around to see if he could be overheard, and Mr. Odwall's heart
  leapt.</p>

  <p>"This is our mystery which you know. It was whispered to me by my father,
  the great chief K'suro, and I also will tell it to my son when the hand of
  death is on my face."</p>

  <p>From under his chief's robe of dingy skins, he brought a little clay pot
  which was filled to the brim with a greenish-yellow substance of the
  consistency of butter. Mr. Odwall's jaw dropped. For one wild moment of
  exhilaration he had expected the withered hand to come out of the robe
  holding a small bag of gold.</p>

  <p>"This is our wonder," said the chief in a hushed voice. "Because of this
  we are different from all other men."</p>

  <p>He caught hold of his guest's unwilling hand, smeared a little of the
  green butter on his hairy arm, and then, with the edge of his robe, wiped it
  clean. Where there had been hair was a smooth surface.</p>

  <p>"We are bald because of this magic," said the old chief, blissfully
  unconscious of the other's rising annoyance. "This I give to you because it
  is more wonderful than anything in the world."</p>

  <p>Mr. Odwall's first impulse was to throw the pot at the old man's head, but
  he conquered this desire, and put the little jar on the ground beside
  him.</p>

  <p>"That is fine talk and good magic, chief," he said briskly; "but I have
  heard of other wonders in this forest, such as the yellow dust that comes out
  of the earth. Now I tell you that in my own country I am a very great chief
  and have many slaves and great riches, and I sleep upon a fine skin bed every
  night. And if you tell me truly where this yellow dust lies, I will make you
  a rich man. Your goats shall fill the forest, and the houses of your wives
  shall be a village."</p>

  <p>Ch'uga, the chief, was obviously ill at ease.</p>

  <p>"Lord, I know of no yellow dust," he said uneasily; "nor must I speak of
  such, for that is Sandi's order. Once a man came to the third hole and took
  away dust, and that was a bad palaver, for Sandi followed him to the end of
  the world and caught him. Let me tell you of this strange mud of yours, and
  of our cunning in making it. First we take the fat of goats, and this we boil
  in a big pot, with the red berries&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Odwall yawned.</p>

  <p>"Tell me tomorrow, chief."</p>

  <p>He had learnt all he wanted to know. The third hole&mdash;that was the
  third shallow pan, four miles away. That night, when the village slept, he
  crept forth from his hut, carrying a canvas bag which contained a big trowel,
  and, moving cautiously, so that the watchman might not see him, he went
  through a fringe of woodland and came to the desolation. Working his way
  round by a circuitous route, he reached "the third hole." The ground was soft
  and friable, yielding to his trowel without calling for any exceptional
  effort of strength.</p>

  <p>He got through the top layer and struck what he guessed was the alluvial
  patch, and, opening the mouth of his bag, he half filled it. He tested its
  weight: he could carry that back to the village and could wash the dirt at
  his leisure. He had risen to his feet and was twisting the neck of the bag,
  preparatory to hoisting it on his back, when he looked round and saw a figure
  standing in the moonlight. It was the old chief.</p>

  <p>"O, ko!" said Ch'uga dismally. "This is a bad palaver, and I will send to
  Sandi this sad news. Master, you will empty your sack."</p>

  <p>"Empty nothing!" snarled Odwall. And then, in Bomongo, he tried to excuse
  his presence. But as he sought to pass the custodian of the Pans, the old man
  gripped him by the arm, very gently but very strongly.</p>

  <p>"Master, you do not go hence," he said.</p>

  <p>Odwall tried to wrench himself free, and, finding this difficult,
  encumbered as he was, dropped his bag and pushed the old man back. He saw the
  glint of a killing spear raised in warning, and struck savagely with his
  sharp-edged trowel. The blow got home and the old man, stumbling to his
  knees, fell an inert heap. Odwall cursed his folly, and, going down on to his
  knees, turned the chief on to his back. He was bleeding freely, and at the
  sight of the still face the adventurer felt a cold chill run down his spine.
  Sanders would be merciless if he caught him now. There would be a rope and a
  tree, and his would be a name blotted out and forgotten.</p>

  <p>He took out a handkerchief and bandaged the wound as well as he could; and
  then, with his sack over his shoulder and wet with perspiration, he went back
  to the village and, packing his grip, struck the path which led to the coast.
  For three days he toiled on without carriers or bearers, in the blazing heat
  of the tropical sun, fearful every moment of hearing the patter of footsteps
  behind him, sleeping on his feet as he staggered under the heavy burden of
  his treasure.</p>

  <p>At last he came to where he had left his paddlers and, without more ado,
  he heaved bag and suit-case to the bottom of the canoe, before he dropped
  like a log into his place in the stern; before the paddlers began their
  chant, he was asleep. When he awoke it was early morning, and the canoe was
  tied up to the side of a little wood. He saw the red glow of the fire and put
  out his hand for the bag of earth which had cost him so dear. It was not
  there!</p>

  <p>His hoarse yell of anger brought the headman of the paddlers to him.</p>

  <p>"Lord, it was only earth, and was weighing down the canoe, for the waters
  are rough near the Isisi River, so we threw it overboard."</p>

  <p>Odwall raged up and down the bank like a lunatic, cursing the men, cursing
  Sanders, cursing everything except his own insensate folly.</p>

  <p>Bones went down to meet the canoe as soon as it was sighted, and was
  shocked at the ghastly appearance of the man.</p>

  <p>"Dear old astrologer!" he said in alarm. "You've got fever, dear old
  secretary. You must let me give you a little quinine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"When does the next boat call?"</p>

  <p>"It's calling, dear old archi&mdash;whatever the word is. Did you find the
  Roman remains? That thing"&mdash;Bones's hands worked rapidly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I found it," said the other impatiently.</p>

  <p>He was relieved to discover that news had not already come to Headquarters
  of his crime. Perhaps Ch'uga was not dead. These old natives were as tough as
  wire.</p>

  <p>"Won't you wait and see the Commissioner? He's returning tomorrow,"</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow?" Odwall nearly screamed the word. "No, no, I must go today. You
  say the ship is calling?"</p>

  <p>Bones pointed dramatically to the sea. A big German steamer had dropped
  anchor, and the surf-boat was being lowered.</p>

  <p>The departure of Mr. Walter Bagen, Secretary of the Central African
  Archaeological Society, was something in the nature of a disappointment to
  Bones, who had prepared quite a lot of interesting but inaccurate information
  upon a hypothetical Greek occupation of the country, based largely on the
  presence of a Corinthian pillar which supported the veranda of the Residency
  and which, if the truth be told, had been brought to the country by Sanders's
  predecessor.</p>

  <p>Not until the flat shores of the River Territories had sunk beneath the
  rim of the ocean did Mr. Odwall feel comfortable.</p>

  <p>The boat did not touch at another British port until it called at
  Plymouth. And now he could settle down to the invention of a story which
  would satisfy his financial supporter.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wilberry came to the reoccupied Jermyn Street flat, well aware that he
  had to listen to a story of failure; for he was a business man, and was quite
  capable of interpreting a letter which began: "I have got back, as you will
  see, and although the results of my visit were not all I could have
  desired&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am going to tell you the truth," said Odwall, when the red-faced man
  had settled himself comfortably in the only armchair large enough to seat
  him.</p>

  <p>Oddly enough, the story the returned wanderer told was substantially
  true&mdash;it was the easiest and the most plausible explanation of his
  abortive effort.</p>

  <p>"Bad luck," said Mr. Wilberry, who had lost money before. "But I should
  have thought that if you'd given the old bird enough money, he'd have helped
  you?"</p>

  <p>Odwall shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You don't know the influence that swine Sanders has over the natives," he
  said. And then he remembered. "Here's something that will interest you."</p>

  <p>He went into his bedroom, brought back a small jar of native make, and,
  taking off the oil paper with which he had covered its contents, he showed
  the greenish-yellow ointment.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wilberry frowned.</p>

  <p>"A depilatory?" he said. "Does it work?"</p>

  <p>"Does it work?" Odwall laughed. "It's half empty now. I've used it all the
  way back from Africa to save shaving."</p>

  <p>Wilberry reached out his hand, took the pot, smeared a little on the hair
  by the side of his ear and, taking out his handkerchief, wiped it. A bare
  patch showed where the ointment had touched.</p>

  <p>He caught his breath.</p>

  <p>"Do you know... the formula for this?" he gasped. Odwall shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"No; I didn't bother&mdash;you can get it analysed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Analysed! It's a vegetable product, you fool! Analysts can't tell us
  anything. Did he offer you the formula?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; I couldn't be bothered. I was after gold&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Wilberry waved his podgy hands in despair. "My God!" he howled, and turned
  around on the adventurer with blazing eyes. "You fool! You great brainless
  fool!" he shouted. "Gold, did you want? And you had it!" He held up the pot.
  "Do you realise what you've got here&mdash;what we could have had? If I had
  this formula I could ruin Sheffield! There wouldn't be a razor sold... Oh,
  you short-sighted lunatic!"</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;"stammered the other.</p>

  <p>"But, but!" mimicked his patron savagely. "That pot was worth a million
  pounds&mdash;it was worth ten million&mdash;I'd have had half Sheffield at my
  feet begging for mercy; for the formula of this would have put out of
  business every razor, every safety razor company in the world! Gold! This is
  gold! Under your ugly nose and you couldn't see it!"</p>

  <p>It is a strange fact that neither Bones nor Sanders associated the
  untimely death of the old chief with the visit of the secretary of a great
  archaeological society. Sanders went in search of the white man, and learnt
  only, from the descriptions that were given, that Mr. Odwall had in some way
  returned to the country and had made his escape again.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether it's a sign of mourning or whether it's due to some
  other cause&mdash;the bald people are no longer bald," said Sanders at dinner
  on the night of his return. "Apparently they used some sort of stuff that the
  old chief made, and the secret of which he did not pass on to his people. Now
  the poor old boy's gone, the Bald Men are becoming quite normal again. You
  ought to write to your archaeological society about it. Bones."</p>

  <p>A piece of advice which Bones followed, but the letter came back marked
  "Gone away&mdash;addressee not known."</p>

  <h2><a name="chap07"
     id="chap07">VII. &mdash; THE JOY SEEKERS</a></h2>

  <h3>No record of prior magazine publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">THE Zaire had once paid a visit to the Islands of Joy. There
  was a group of six, none larger than a mile in circumference, and two of them
  half that size; and they were uninhabited. For, although water was to be had
  here and vegetation grew in great abundance, there was neither monkey nor rat
  nor even snake.</p>

  <p>Once upon a time the Portuguese had established a post on the island, and
  the grey ruins of a little fort were still visible; and there was evidence of
  cultivated fields. But nobody coveted the Islands of Joy; they were not even
  in a geographical position which would have justified the establishment of a
  cable station.</p>

  <p>Bones had threatened to spend a fortnight in a botanical
  classification&mdash;it was at a time when he was badly bitten with the
  botanical fever, and kept volumes of pressed grasses and flowers,
  inaccurately named. But his promise was never kept, and the Islands of Joy
  stood for a landmark and a menace to shipping; though, if the truth be told,
  no regular line came within twenty miles of these pleasant rocks.</p>

  <p>There were legends about them, and these existed far up the river, amongst
  people whose eyes had never rested on the sea. It was the summer home of
  M'shimba-M'shamba, according to one account; and populated by a race of
  slaves who made cloth for the white people, according to another.</p>

  <p>The Kano people had a legend that Mahomet had once landed on the largest,
  and had been inspired by a dream that all the world would be converted to his
  teachings. But then, the Kano people invest the most commonplace spot with
  holy mystery.</p>

  <p>The Houssas are Mohammedan in all their habits and practices except that
  they do not keep their women veiled, though Abiboo once told Mr. Commissioner
  Sanders that certain of the Fula&mdash;who, under the Emir, are the lords of
  Kano&mdash;have this custom. But if they do not segregate their womenfolk,
  they hold rigid views on their integrity. And when Benabdul, a soldier of the
  King's Houssas, coming through the wood, found his young and lovely wife
  struggling in the arms of Achmet the bugler, and heard her fearful screams,
  he flew at the good-looking youth, who had offended beyond pardon, and there
  would have been murder, only the sound of the affray brought Sergeant Abiboo
  on the scene, and Abiboo's favourite peacemaker was a stiff strip of
  rhinoceros hide, which hurt.</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbetts held his morning palaver at seven o'clock, and before
  him was marched the erring bugler and the story of his abominable deeds was
  told. The woman did not testify&mdash;her husband was there to speak for her.
  He was very voluble. When the evidence was ended. Bones fixed his monocle and
  gave judgment.</p>

  <p>"You will be kept in the dark prison for seven days. All the marks on your
  arm that say 'this is a good soldier' shall be taken from your arm, and you
  shall lose your pay all the time you are in prison."</p>

  <p>So Achmet went to the cells behind the guard-room and picked oakum on a
  sparse dietary.</p>

  <p>"Better send the young fool back to H.Q.," suggested Sanders, and Captain
  Hamilton agreed.</p>

  <p>But the moving of units from one station to another is not an easy matter.
  There were reports (in triplicate) to be made to H.Q., memoranda to answer,
  and this takes time. The unpopular Achmet came out of prison and resumed his
  bugle practice, and it looked as though matters would settle down, for
  Benabdul, the injured husband, was a mild man and incapable of sustaining a
  feud.</p>

  <p>Not so his wife, it seemed. Her name was Fahmeh, and she was of the Arab
  type, brown, and, by European standards, pretty, for her nose was thin and
  straight, and she had fine eyes.</p>

  <p>It was she who kept clean the hut of Lieutenant Tibbetts and laundered his
  linen.</p>

  <p>"Lord," she said one morning whilst she was at her work, "this man Achmet
  still looks at me as I pass him, and his eyes are terribly loving. I am
  afraid."</p>

  <p>Bones had a face almost entirely covered with lather at that moment, and
  his bright razor was poised.</p>

  <p>"Woman, if you did not look at him, you would not be offended," he said;
  "for it is written in the Sura of the Djin that offence comes from
  knowing."</p>

  <p>She frowned at this.</p>

  <p>"All the women point at me," she said, "and some ask why my husband does
  not beat him. Until this man goes I will not be happy, for I hate him."</p>

  <p>"All things happen," said the philosophical young officer, and went on
  with his toilet.</p>

  <p>Bones was undoubtedly working very hard just then, and had his own
  worries. His many musical possessions gathered dust in odd places, his
  portable harmonium was never opened, the bagpipes presented by a misguided
  administrator hung neglected (Fahmeh never even dusted them, believing them
  to be the dried remains of a sea monster of the octopus family).</p>

  <p>He was working more industriously and continuously than usual at a law
  course. From Headquarters had come an elaborate circular urging the necessity
  for "all officers holding administrative positions or assistants to officers
  holding administrative positions, or officers who may at any time be called
  upon, in the absence of the proper administrative authorities, to occupy such
  offices," to direct their minds to the study of law, offering as an
  inducement a microscopic addition to their pay for proficiency in the
  subject.</p>

  <p>It needed only this to drive Bones into the glad and welcoming arms of the
  Medicine Hat College of Law and Jurisprudence, whose page advertisement
  filled every magazine of note.</p>

  <p>"Learn Law!" said the announcement peremptorily.</p>

  <p>Bones wrote for information and had back a carload of literature, a letter
  that began "Dear Friend," and a blank which wasn't a blank at all, and only
  required his signature on the dotted line to bring the revealed mysteries of
  the law to his breakfast-table.</p>

  <p>"And what value the laws of the United States will be to you, God knows,"
  said Hamilton, finding his subordinate immersed in the study of
  Impersonation. "What you should get down to is an analysis of the ten
  commandments."</p>

  <p>Bones stretched back in his chair wearily and closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Dear old sir," he said with offensive patience, "why blither? This sort
  of thing is a bit deep for you, dear old sir. I'll bet that you don't know
  that it's illegal to pretend you're somebody else?"</p>

  <p>"You stagger me," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"And I'll bet you don't know, poor old ignoramus, that if I went to you
  an' said I'm Sanders, and I wasn't Sanders, an' you thought I was Sanders an'
  gave me a cheque, what I should be?"</p>

  <p>"I know what I should be," replied Hamilton.</p>

  <p>At a later period of the day he expressed his uneasiness to Sanders.</p>

  <p>"I've never known Bones to take study quite so seriously," he said. "He's
  walking about like a man in a dream, and calls me 'your honour.' Do you mind
  going through the mail, sir, and taking out any correspondence marked
  'Medicine Hat School of Law'?"</p>

  <p>Sanders smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can't do that," he said, "but I'll talk to Bones."</p>

  <p>Before he could do so, a curious thing occurred. The corporal of the guard
  reported that he had seen Bones walking about the parade ground in the middle
  of the night. Bones had his hut on the other side of the parade, directly
  opposite the guard-room, and it was not unusual on a hot night, when sleep
  was difficult, for the sentry to see a tall young man, in violently striped
  pyjamas and mosquito boots, pacing up and down outside the house. When the
  sentry saw the figure in pyjamas walk across to the store-house, an ugly
  little tin building where the soldiers' clothing was kept, he thought nothing
  of it. He mentioned the matter to the corporal of the guard, who as casually
  told Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"What time was this?" asked the interested captain of Houssas.</p>

  <p>"Lord, it was the third hour before the light."</p>

  <p>When they met at breakfast: "What the devil were you doing in the middle
  of the night?" asked Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Me, sir?" said Bones. "Sleepin', sir; that's what I generally do, dear
  old Ham."</p>

  <p>Hamilton looked at him in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear man, you were wandering about the parade ground at 3
  a.m.!"</p>

  <p>Bones gaped at him.</p>

  <p>"Me, sir? I, sir, I mean? Give the poor old captain a little air," he said
  gently. "Sun, dear old sir&mdash;heat, poor old captain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me that you weren't walking around in your impossible
  pyjamas at three o'clock this morning?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said Bones. "And as to my pyjamas&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We won't discuss those at breakfast," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever walked in your sleep, Bones?" asked Sanders.</p>

  <p>"As a youth, sir," admitted Lieutenant Tibbetts; "many, many years
  ago."</p>

  <p>When they discussed the matter in private, Sanders made light of the
  incident.</p>

  <p>"He is working hard, and that probably accounts for his sleep-walking. He
  can't do much harm to himself, but you had better tell the sergeant of the
  guard to keep an eye on him."</p>

  <p>That night nothing happened, but on the night following Hamilton, finding
  the night too hot for sleep, pulled his camp bed on to the stoep, hoping that
  the mosquitoes would not observe the absence of a protective net. After an
  hour of slapping and whisking, he rose with a curse, went into the dark
  dining-room and mixed a tepid lime-juice swizzle. When he came out to his
  bed, he was as wide awake as ever he had been in his life and, abandoning his
  plan to re-erect a mosquito net around his bed, sat down in one of the
  long-seated chairs and lit a cheroot.</p>

  <p>There was a full moon&mdash;it was almost as light as day. He saw the
  glitter of the sentry's bayonet as he strolled leisurely up and down, and the
  dull-red glow of the illicit cigarette which the soldier was smoking.
  Hamilton grinned. In his early days he would have pulled up the man before
  him and punished him for this dereliction of duty, but he had learned that
  there were certain breaches of military law that were so human that to check
  them arbitrarily was to be guilty of inhumanity.</p>

  <p>And then suddenly he saw a pyjama'd figure cross the square and disappear
  into the hut occupied by Bones. He waited for five minutes and, his curiosity
  getting the better of him, he got up and, finding an electric torch, walked
  across the campus. Bones had left both windows and doors wide open and,
  flashing the rays of his lamp inside he saw his subaltern lying fast asleep
  under the mosquito netting. As the light touched his face Bones grunted,
  turned over...</p>

  <p>"Arson," he muttered, "is a form of crime jolly well abhorrent to
  civilised communities."</p>

  <p>Hamilton passed across the square to the sentry, whose cigarette lay
  glowing on the ground, mute evidence of his offence.</p>

  <p>"No, lord, I did not see Tibbetti come out of his little house," said the
  man; "but there is a door behind where I cannot see, and Tibbetti comes and
  goes&mdash;therefore I did not challenge him, for he is a high one."</p>

  <p>"Did he throw away this cigarette?" demanded the sarcastic officer.</p>

  <p>"Lord, he must have done this, for who else would smoke?"</p>

  <p>Hamilton thought it unwise to discuss the point. On the following day the
  homeward and outward mails arrived, and amongst the letters (which included
  fat envelopes from the Medicine Hat School of Law) was the official order to
  transfer Bugler Achmet to Headquarters. Hamilton had just time to set the
  man's papers in order (for a soldier is attached to an extensive
  documentation) and bundle the man on to the north-bound steamer, and was in
  consequence so busy that he had no time to question the sleep-walker. Bones,
  in moments of crisis like these, was the weakest of reeds. He invariably
  entered a man's crimes on his medical history sheet, and recorded a sore
  throat on the sheet reserved for a soldier's delinquencies.</p>

  <p>The opportunity did not come till very late in the evening.</p>

  <p>"Bless my jolly old soul!" said Bones, aghast. "Walking in my sleep
  &mdash;you're pulling my leg. Ham!"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't near enough to do that, or I'd have given you a spank that would
  have awakened you."</p>

  <p>"And probably killed me!" said the indignant Bones. "That's homicide, dear
  old officer, in the third degree. Never do that. Ham. Restrain yourself."</p>

  <p>So far from being alarmed at this revelation of his eccentricity. Bones
  seemed rather proud of his abnormality, spoke of hair-raising adventures in
  his youth, and told a long and thrilling story of how he once walked along a
  parapet.</p>

  <p>"Destruction, dear old sir, staring me in the face."</p>

  <p>"I sympathise with destruction," said Hamilton coldly; "but for the moment
  I warn you that you'll be getting yourself into serious trouble. It wouldn't
  look well if I appointed a keeper&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I should say it wouldn't!" snapped Bones.</p>

  <p>"But," continued Hamilton, "you'll have to find some way of stopping this
  night-prowling of yours. I am going to suggest that you cover your floor with
  tintacks."</p>

  <p>Bones made gurgling noises of protest.</p>

  <p>"Or else that you tie your big toe to the bedpost. You're demoralising the
  detachment, and it has got to be stopped."</p>

  <p>Bones shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I'll look into the matter, sir," he said peevishly.</p>

  <p>When he went back to his hut, Fahmeh, the Kano woman, was unrolling his
  netting and tucking the loose ends under the mattress.</p>

  <p>"Now my heart is happy, Tibbetti," she said, "for Achmet has gone on the
  big ship, and I shall not see him any more."</p>

  <p>Bones was not in the mood to gossip about Achmet and the rights and wrongs
  of this young lady. But he was anxious to secure outside information about
  his own nocturnal habits.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Fahmeh," he said, "do the soldiers ever see me walking at
  night?"</p>

  <p>To his amazement she nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, lord, I have seen you in your fine silk bedclothes and your high
  yellow boots. Once you came to my hut and called my husband, and I came out
  to you and you told me that you needed him. Because you looked strangely,
  lord, I thought you were mad."</p>

  <p>Bones sat down heavily upon the nearest chair.</p>

  <p>"Bless my life!" he said feebly, and turned pale. "Heavens alive and holy
  snakes!" he added, and ran his fingers through his thin yellow hair.</p>

  <p>"Also," she went on remorselessly, "many of the soldiers have seen you go
  into the house of cloths; and last night Militini saw you."</p>

  <p>Bones waved her out of the hut. Perhaps he was going mad? Young men
  &mdash;intelligent and bright young men&mdash;had been driven mad before in
  this territory by the blazing sun and the everlasting blueness of the
  skies.</p>

  <p>When he went up to dinner he carried with him a document, which he thrust
  tragically before Sanders's eyes. "I'd like you to witness this, dear old sir
  an' Excellency," he said miserably. "I've left you my little bungalow at
  Shoreham, and I've given old Ham all my guns and things..."</p>

  <p>"What is this?" asked Sanders, examining the document, which began:</p>

  <p>'I, Augustus Tibbetts, Lieutenant of King's Houssas, being of sounde mind
  and in full pesesion of my fackiltys...'</p>

  <p>"A will? What rubbish! And besides, Bones," smiled Sanders, "I couldn't
  witness a will that left me even a Shoreham bungalow. Are you feeling
  ill?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir&mdash;on the borderline, sir," said Bones, in his most sepulchral
  tone. "Nutty, sir." He tapped his head. "Seein' things, sir, an' hearin'
  things, sir, and sky-hootin' all over the place at night, sir."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you're sleep-walking? Well, that's not going to kill you," said
  Sanders and, as Achmet's successor sounded the officers' mess call: "Sit down
  and eat."</p>

  <p>The huts of the Houssas form two lines nearly parallel with the shore of
  the river. By their side, and nearer to the sea, are their gardens, where
  sweet potatoes and onion and mealies grow in plenty. At night-time there is
  certain picturesqueness about the lines, for three fires burn and there comes
  the sound of a tuneless banjo, the clapping of hands and the turn-turn of an
  elongated dancing drum.</p>

  <p>That night, before he went to bed. Bones fixed an elaborate trap
  calculated to wake him in the event of his taking an unconscious stroll. It
  consisted of an old shotgun resting precariously on the open edge of the
  door, and a broom-handle, the requisite height being secured by balancing the
  broom-handle on a chair.</p>

  <p>The man who came to rouse him in the dark hours may have guessed
  this&mdash;a likely possibility, since every man, woman and child in the
  station had seen Bones fixing the trap.</p>

  <p>"Tibbetti!" he called urgently.</p>

  <p>At the third repetition of his name Bones leapt out of bed, thrust open
  the door, and was knocked almost senseless by the shot-gun.</p>

  <p>"Man, why do you call me?" he growled, rubbing his head.</p>

  <p>"Lord, will you come and see? Benabdul has been killed!"</p>

  <p>Bones struggled into his coat, pulled on his boots and went out into the
  black night.</p>

  <p>"Who killed this man?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Lord, none knows. In the night his wife heard him cry out, and when she
  went from her hut, there, by the favour of God, lay Benabdul."</p>

  <p>Somebody had roused a fire to a blaze. All the Houssa huts had emptied,
  and a crowd of half-naked men and women surrounded the thing on the
  ground.</p>

  <p>The man had been speared through the heart, and lay on his side, his two
  arms outstretched towards the village street. Benabdul's weeping wife had
  begged that he be carried into the hut, but the Houssas had left him where
  they found him.</p>

  <p>Bones went up to the Residency and aroused the Commissioner and Hamilton,
  and together they went back to the huts.</p>

  <p>Sanders was puzzled. There was no war in the country, and this man had
  been so extremely insignificant that he had no enemies except Achmet, who was
  on a ship and a hundred miles away. Moreover, there were no family quarrels
  such as distinguish most family circles; he lived happily with his wife and
  seldom beat her. The thing was inexplicable.</p>

  <p>Later, Sanders examined the weapon&mdash;a short throwing spear. There
  were scores of them at headquarters. The Houssas bought or stole them from
  the Upper River&mdash;Bones had a dozen in his own hut.</p>

  <p>"It is very queer. Bring the woman to me," he said.</p>

  <p>Her friends had succeeded in quietening the sobbing wife, and she was
  brought to where Sanders sat by the side of the fire.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me, woman," he said kindly, "did you hear no sound in the
  night?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated. "Lord, I heard a voice calling my husband, and he went
  out," she sobbed.</p>

  <p>"What voice?" asked Sanders gently. "For, Fahmeh, you know all your
  husband's comrades."</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "It was none of these." And then she looked strangely
  at Bones, and he went as white as death.</p>

  <p>"Mine?" he croaked.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Lord, it was your voice I heard, speaking to my husband," she said in a
  hushed tone. "And then I heard no more till he cried out."</p>

  <p>Bones did not flinch. He grew a little suffer, a little more erect than
  usual, then, stooping, picked up the spear which had been taken out and
  examined it in the light of the fire. One end had been shaved, and there was
  an initial.</p>

  <p>"This is my spear," he said simply. "I brought it down from the N'gombi
  three months ago."</p>

  <p>Hamilton took his hands and turned them over. There was blood on them, but
  that may have come from the spear he had been handling, which was still wet.
  And then he turned his cold eyes on Fahmeh.</p>

  <p>"Woman," he said, "you could not have heard Tibbetti. That is foolish
  talk. Whilst Tibbetti slept, I sat in the shadow of his hut and watched,
  knowing his strange way of walking when he sleeps."</p>

  <p>"As to that, lord, I know nothing," she said simply, "only it was
  Tibbetti's voice which called Benabdul into the open."</p>

  <p>And she would not budge from this. The sentry was questioned, he had not
  seen Bones cross the square, but there was a path through the bush, which
  would have made it possible for him to reach the hut unseen.</p>

  <p>"We'll talk this over," said Sanders calmly. "Come up to the house. Bones,
  and have a drink."</p>

  <p>The three men went silently across the square into the dark house, and
  Hamilton lit the lamps and placed a large bottle of whisky on the table.
  Bones's face was white and set; he pushed aside the glass with a shake of his
  head.</p>

  <p>"No, thank you, dear old Ham," he said, a trifle huskily. And then: "Did I
  kill this unfortunate beggar? I must confess that I was thinking about him
  when I went to sleep."</p>

  <p>"You killed nobody," said Hamilton savagely. "What are you blathering
  about? The woman's half mad with horror, and she'll tell a different story in
  the morning. Somebody had a grudge against Benabdul and settled him. There's
  nothing remarkable about that?" he challenged Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Sanders quietly.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I killed him, sir?" asked Bones, his face tense.</p>

  <p>Sanders's hand went up to his chin.</p>

  <p>"Do I think you killed him?" he repeated slowly. "No, I don't, Bones."</p>

  <p>It was a sleepless night for them all, and when daylight came Sanders had
  an idea, which he communicated to the senior officer.</p>

  <p>"Have you thought of inspecting your store to see if there is anything
  missing?" he asked. "According to the reports, Bones was seen to visit the
  store on two different occasions."</p>

  <p>The idea had not occurred to Hamilton, and without further ado he found
  his key and went down to the little tin building, accompanied by Sergeant
  Abiboo, that clerkly man, and made a brief inspection. It was brief because,
  at first glance, it was evident that the store had been visited by somebody
  in a great hurry. A pile of brown blankets had been overturned, and when
  these were counted six were found to be missing. In the inner store-room,
  where preserved foods were kept, a case had been broken open and ten cans of
  meat and vegetables had gone. Nor was this all: in a smaller room of the
  store&mdash;it was little more than a closet&mdash;had been ten stands of new
  Lee-Enfield rifles, which had been sent to the station for tuition purposes,
  the troops hereabouts being armed with the old Lee-Metford. Two rifles and a
  box of ammunition had disappeared. And, what was more, an attempt had been
  made to open the little safe, which, however, contained nothing more valuable
  than records and stock sheets. Hamilton went back to Sanders with the
  information he had gleaned.</p>

  <p>"A sleep-walker would hardly have made such a systematic robbery," said
  Sanders thoughtfully. "I'll telegraph to Headquarters. The boat should have
  arrived there this morning, and if the land line's working&mdash;"</p>

  <p>That it was working, was demonstrated when at that moment the Eurasian
  clerk who acted as chief telegraphist came over with a scrawled message. It
  was from the Officer Commanding Troops:</p>

  <p>Private Achmet was not on ship when arrived. Captain believes Achmet
  jumped overboard before ship left your coasts.</p>

  <p>They looked at one another.</p>

  <p>"Find Achmet," said Sanders briefly. "He was, remember, a powerful
  swimmer, and could easily have reached the bush."</p>

  <p>Behind the beach was a stretch of bush country that ran for fifty miles
  northward. It was sparsely inhabited, being, in certain seasons, subjected to
  a terrible wind which invariably missed the river, and except for a few
  poverty-stricken tribes, who eked out their livelihood by fishing, there were
  no people of importance in this area.</p>

  <p>"He got to the bush, made his way to the station in the night and settled
  Benabdul," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"But Bones's voice?" suggested Sanders.</p>

  <p>"It is an old trick. These Houssa fellows are born imitators, and Bones is
  a favourite subject of theirs."</p>

  <p>He himself gave a life-like imitation of Bones calling Benabdul in Arabic
  and by name.</p>

  <p>A search of the bush country was impracticable, but Bones and two trackers
  went along the beach in search of footprints, and two miles from the station
  they found them, a succession of tracks which led from the sea's edge to the
  bush, where they disappeared. Just here a shallow stream runs from the bush
  into the sea, and Bones went up the creek until it got too deep and tangled
  for wading. Here the crocodiles have a breeding-place, and even as he stepped
  through the water he heard the splash of a big fellow as it fell from an
  unseen log into the water.</p>

  <p>He returned and reported the tracks. The assembly was sounded; every man,
  on or off duty, paraded on the square, and one by one Hamilton questioned
  them. But nobody had seen Achmet, the bugler; and Hamilton knew that they
  were not lying. The man was not popular and he would find no friends to hide
  him up.</p>

  <p>"You had better sleep at the Residency tonight, Bones," suggested Sanders
  that evening. But Bones demurred.</p>

  <p>"I want to be sure how much I'm in this, sir," he said quietly. "If old
  Ham will give orders to the sentry that I'm to be challenged wherever I'm
  seen, I think I shall be more satisfied."</p>

  <p>His eyes were heavy with weariness when he pulled aside the mosquito
  curtain and lay on the top of his bed that night, and his head had scarcely
  touched the pillow before he was in a profound sleep. When he was sure that
  Bones was slumbering, Hamilton carried a deck-chair down to his hut, planted
  it outside the door, making a circuit of the hut, and propped a stout stake
  against the back door, so that it could not be opened. When this was done, he
  returned to the front of the house, and, settling down with a rug over his
  knees, he fell into a fitful sleep. The chair was drawn across the entrance
  of the hut so that it was impossible for anybody to leave without waking
  him.</p>

  <p>The yell that brought him to his feet did not come from the hut. He stood
  up, his heart beating a little more quickly, listening, and heard excited
  voices coming from the guard-room. His first thought was of Bones, and,
  kicking aside the chair, he ran into the hut&mdash;Bones's bed was empty!</p>

  <p>With a sinking heart he ran out and across the square, just as the
  sergeant of the guard was setting forth to waken him.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the man tremulously, "Sergeant Abiboo&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dead?" asked Hamilton, shocked.</p>

  <p>"No, lord, but he is hurt. While he slept, somebody came into his hut and
  speared him, but he lay on his side..."</p>

  <p>Hamilton did not wait for any further information but flew to the Houssa
  lines, and, pushing aside the people who crowded before the entrance of
  Abiboo's hut, he went in.</p>

  <p>The wound was a slight one. Abiboo was sitting on his skin bed whilst one
  of his two wives dressed the wound gingerly.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing, lord," he said frankly, "except that felt this sharp pain
  and woke up. Before I could get out of my bed, my enemy had gone."</p>

  <p>"Did you hear anybody speaking?" asked Hamilton quickly.</p>

  <p>If Abiboo had not, a woman who slept in the next hut had heard somebody
  call him by name.</p>

  <p>"It was Tibbetti, lord," she said.</p>

  <p>"Mother of fools," snarled Hamilton, "how could it be Tibbetti when
  Tibbetti is sleeping in his hut?"</p>

  <p>Fahmeh detached herself from the group that stood around him.</p>

  <p>"Lord, I saw Tibbetti," she said, "walking through the village like a
  ghost, and carrying in his hand a spear, all red with blood. And this he
  threw down before my hut, where I sat watching. And because I was afraid I
  did not touch it."</p>

  <p>Sanders had joined them by this time, and the two men went on a tour of
  inspection. The spear lay in the centre of the pathway which runs between the
  two lines of huts, and, picking it up, Hamilton turned his light upon the
  haft and groaned. Without a word he handed the weapon to Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Is he in his hut?" asked the Commissioner in a troubled tone.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. How he got out, heaven knows!" The bugler sounded the alarm, and
  the Houssas hurried into their huts to dress. In parties of twos and threes
  they were sent out to beat first of all the Residency wood, whilst a stronger
  party was sent off post-haste along the beach. Throughout the night the
  search continued, but there was no sign either of Bones or of the Houssa
  Achmet.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand it," said Sanders, when Hamilton returned with the
  first light of dawn to report the failure of the parties. "Bones could not
  possibly&mdash;pshaw! it's absurd!"</p>

  <p>Hamilton stood with his hands clasped behind him, his chin on his breast,
  a picture of dejection.</p>

  <p>"It is horrible," he said, in despair. "Of course, it may be some
  queer&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Out of the corner of his eye he saw a man flying across the square. It was
  the wounded Abiboo. He came up the four steps to the stoep in one leap.</p>

  <p>"Master," he said breathlessly, "Fahmeh, the woman of Benabdul, is gone!"
  There was a silence.</p>

  <p>"Gone?"</p>

  <p>The man nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, lord. Nobody saw her go, but Tibbetti was seen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What!" shouted Hamilton. "When was he seen?"</p>

  <p>"When all the men were on the parade ground," replied the Houssa, "an old
  woman, who stayed behind because of the swelling in her leg&mdash;she was the
  wife of Corporal A Pula, who was killed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where did she see Tibbetti?" interrupted Sanders.</p>

  <p>"In his little ship," was the astonishing answer. "The Chic-a-chic. He
  passed like a ghost down the towards the big waters."</p>

  <p>"I'll be damned!" said Hamilton helplessly. He flew down to the quay,
  hoping that the woman had been mistaken. The motor-launch was gone.</p>

  <p>A first-class mystery this promised to be, and Sander had written three
  folios of his report to Headquarter when an excited Hamilton called him to
  the beach. The little Wiggle was coming in from the sea, towing behind a long
  canoe in which two miserable people were seated.</p>

  <p>This was the story of Fahmeh, the Kano woman, when she stood before
  Sanders:</p>

  <p>"Lord, this man Achmet was my lover, because he was young and beautiful
  and my husband was old and silly And when Benabdul found me in his arms, I
  acted as though I hated him, knowing the time would come when we would go
  away to the Islands of Joy and build a hut and sow our own garden, and live
  there for ever. And I hated Tibbetti because he sent my man to the dark
  prison. We had a canoe in the little creek, and, knowing that Tibbetti slept
  well, Achmet got the key of the house of cloth and took therefrom all we
  desired for our long journey to the Islands. Also a bag of rice and a bag of
  salt and lines with cunning hooks for fishing, and cloth to cover us. I
  killed Benabdul because I hated him, and spoke evilly of Tibbetti because I
  hated him worse. I would have killed Abiboo for the cruel way he beat my man,
  but he lay on his side."</p>

  <p>Sanders made no comment. It would have been a waste of time. He committed
  his prisoners to the little lock-up and gave Bones an opportunity of
  explaining the miracle.</p>

  <p>"Thought it all out when I was lying in bed, dear old Excellency," said
  Bones, "whilst poor old Ham was snoring like a pig outside," he added
  insolently. "Got the idea in a flash. Deduction an' logic, sir an' brother
  officer. I knew this naughty old lady had the run of my hut, and was the only
  person who could take a spear. I'm a very methodical person, dear old sir. A
  lot of people don't realise that. I knew I had ten, or maybe twelve, spears
  in my hut, and so I got up, lit the light an' counted 'em, and there were
  only seven, or maybe nine."</p>

  <p>"Or maybe twelve," suggested Hamilton, with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"There were three missing, or perhaps five," said Bones gravely. "Anyway,
  there were some missing. It struck me what a jolly good idea it would be if I
  went down and searched this wicked old person's hut."</p>

  <p>"In the middle of the night," murmured Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"I stepped over you, and you never heard me," said Bones in triumph. "And
  listen, Ham&mdash;I'm no sleepwalker! The wicked person who walked in and out
  of my hut in my pyjamas was Achmet himself. I never dreamt anybody could be
  such a fearful cad as to pinch my pyjamas. However, that is by the way. I
  went down to the Houssa lines by the bush path, and I had hardly got into the
  village when I saw Mrs. Benabdul come out of Abiboo's hut and heard the
  rumpus. To hide myself was the work of a moment. I guessed the whole story in
  a second. My brain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We will imagine all that, Bones," said Sanders good-humouredly. "What
  happened?"</p>

  <p>Apparently Bones had followed the murderess through the woods, where her
  lover was waiting for her with a canoe, provisioned and ready for the
  journey. The canoe was sliding over the surf before Bones realised the
  objective of the party, and, dashing back to the quay where the little
  motor-launch lay, he had set forth in pursuit.</p>

  <p>"But I don't walk in my sleep: that's the point I want to make, dear old
  officer," he said exuberantly. "When I walk I'm awake, and when I'm
  awake&mdash;I'm fearfully keen! If you report this to Headquarters,
  Excellency"&mdash;he addressed Sanders&mdash;"you might mention the fact that
  I did all this without the slightest assistance&mdash;in fact, if anything,
  hampered by naughty old superior."</p>

  <p>Hamilton's reply to this was unprintable.</p>

  <p class="first">DORAN CAMPBELL-CAIRNS was very kind to animals. She adored
  butterflies, and regarded entomologists who collected them as horrible
  people. She would not put her dainty foot upon one harmless and necessary
  worm, and would have swooned at the thought of swatting a fly. She was tall,
  gloriously slim, had one of those pale, clear complexions that some people
  find so adorable; beautifully arched eyebrows, and eyes as dear and blue as a
  morning sky.</p>

  <p>She was the only daughter of His Excellency the Administrator, and she had
  come out for three months, in the healthiest part of the year, before
  settling in Paris at a finishing school where young ladies are taught the art
  of dressing, a discriminating taste in operas, all the new dance steps, and
  are tutored in the ways of most of the old and more expensive
  restaurants.</p>

  <p>She did not seem young to Lieutenant Tibbetts. He thought she was the
  ideal age. He could not imagine her younger or older. She had fluffy golden
  hair, and lips calculated to make a susceptible young man dither on his feet.
  Bones was susceptible and dithered, and the four days that His Excellency
  spent at the Residency were four coloured plates in his drab book of life;
  four scented roses in a garden of onions, if so sublime an experience can be
  likened to anything so ridiculous.</p>

  <p>"Bones," said Sanders one morning, "the Administrator is arriving at the
  end of the week, and he's bringing his daughter with him."</p>

  <p>"Bless her jolly old heart!" murmured Bones, immersed for the moment in
  his mail. "Anything I can do to make the dear old lady
  comfortable&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So far as I can remember," broke in Hamilton, knitting his brows in
  thought, "she's quite a kid. My sister wrote to me about her the other day.
  She's just left school."</p>

  <p>"A few native dolls, I think," said Bones, looking up. "Leave it to me,
  dear old Excellency. I'll amuse the child. It's a funny thing, dear old Ham,
  but children take to me. I'm rather like the bagpipe fellow from where-is-it.
  The moment he tuned up his jolly old pipes&mdash;but you've read the novel,
  dear old Ham: why bother me with questions?"</p>

  <p>"To be exact, I haven't asked you a question yet," said Hamilton. "If I
  did, I should like to know whether you're as big an ass as you seem, or
  whether this super-ignorance of yours is just show-off?"</p>

  <p>"Tut tut!" murmured Bones, back again in his correspondence. "Tut tut,
  dear old baby-snatcher!"</p>

  <p>"What you can do," said Sanders, "is to get the tennis net put up, and ask
  your men to mend the ice plant."</p>

  <p>Bones went down to meet the Administrator with a light heart and a
  whistle. He came back dazed, and, for once in his life, silent.</p>

  <p>Miss Doran had naturally attached herself to him because he was the only
  young man in the party. She thought Sanders looked horribly stern, and
  confided to the awe-stricken Bones that Hamilton had a cruel mouth.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly horrible, young miss," said Bones, hoarse with emotion. "The
  things that jolly old man says to me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I mean, he looks as if he would&mdash;well hurt!"</p>

  <p>Bones nodded his head solemnly.</p>

  <p>"Simply horrible, dear old young lady," he agreed. "Simply doesn't care a
  rap for a fellow's feelings."</p>

  <p>Those wondrous lips of hers uttered a sound of impatience.</p>

  <p>"You're very stupid, Mr. Bones," she said.</p>

  <p>"Tibbetts is my name, but you can call me Bones, Miss, Excellency," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"I shall call you what I like," replied Miss Excellency tartly.</p>

  <p>"And I shall like whatever you call me, dear old person," said Bones, and
  was so pleased with this reply that he recovered a little of his lost
  confidence.</p>

  <p>Four days of seeing her at breakfast, at tiffin, at dinner! Forty-eight
  hours of intoxication with her on the Zaire, when she went with her father on
  a little tour of inspection! And the evenings in the dark of the veranda,
  when she sat in shimmering white, her cool hand so close to his that he could
  have touched it, and did, in fact, touch it once, explaining hastily that he
  had brushed off a mosquito. On the fourth morning, in a delirium of
  misery&mdash;for her boat sailed that afternoon&mdash;he made a
  statement.</p>

  <p>"The point is, young Miss Doran," he said, in so strange a voice that he
  did not recognise himself speaking, "I'm simply awfully nutty about you. I am
  really, dear old miss. I've got an uncle with pots of money&mdash;he's an
  awful big pot&mdash;what I mean to say is that he can't live for
  ever&mdash;few people do, dear old miss... I know you're very young and I'm
  simply fearfully old, and your jolly old father's a perfect
  terror&mdash;though we shouldn't see much of him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What on earth are you talking about?" Her starry eyes were fixed on
  his.</p>

  <p>Bones cleared his throat, wiped the perspiration from his damp forehead
  with a small silk Union Jack, one of his most prized possessions, which he
  intended donating before her departure; coughed again, looked everywhere
  except at her, and then, in a moment of extreme desperation:</p>

  <p>"The point is, dear old lady, what about it?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"What about what?"</p>

  <p>"Jolly old matrimony," croaked Bones. "Tum-tum-ti-tum-tum-tum..."</p>

  <p>She didn't recognise Mendelssohn's Wedding March, but it was well
  intended.</p>

  <p>"Matrimony? Are you proposing to me?" Her eyebrows rose haughtily.</p>

  <p>Bones nodded. He was dumb with adoration, fear, hope, and sensibility.</p>

  <p>"How perfectly ridiculous!" said this young lady who would not tread on a
  harmless and necessary worm, or cruelly swat a fly, or pin Purple Emperors to
  a bit of cork. "How perfectly horribly stupid! I couldn't possibly marry you!
  You're so awfully old. How old are you?"</p>

  <p>"A hundred and five," said Bones, in a dismal effort to be jocular.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you're twenty-four if you're a day," she said severely, "and
  you're awfully plain."</p>

  <p>"Me?" said the indignant Bones. "Me plain? Don't be absurd, dear old silly
  one."</p>

  <p>"Of course you're plain!" she scoffed. "Look at your nose!"</p>

  <p>Bones squinted down the organ in question, but could see nothing
  remarkable except that it was brick-red, but then, so was the rest of his
  face.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with my nose?" he demanded hotly. "And if it comes to
  that, you've got no nose worth speaking about."</p>

  <p>She opened her mouth in an O of pain and wrath. "How dare you speak about
  my nose! I shall tell my father."</p>

  <p>"And you jolly well ought to," said Bones bitterly, "because he's partly
  responsible."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she said again, and then, maliciously: "I couldn't possibly marry a
  man who isn't an athlete. And if you want to know, I'm in love with Harry
  Gilde. He's one of the best forwards in the Cambridge pack."</p>

  <p>Bones waggled his head impatiently.</p>

  <p>"That's the kind of person you would be in love with&mdash;a forward! As
  if you're not forward enough!"</p>

  <p>"Let us walk back to the Residency," she said, with ominous calm.</p>

  <p>Bones shrugged, and walked by her side.</p>

  <p>"After what I have done for you," he said, after a long pause.</p>

  <p>She stopped and glared at him.</p>

  <p>"What have you done for me?"</p>

  <p>"I've shown you everything, haven't I?" he squeaked indignantly. "Who put
  the tennis net up? I did!"</p>

  <p>"And a beastly old tennis net it is," she said.</p>

  <p>"It's the best we've got," said Bones quietly.</p>

  <p>"What else have you done? Now tell me that!" Bones couldn't think for the
  moment, but waved his hand round the landscape.</p>

  <p>"Did you make the earth, I wonder?" she asked sarcastically. "Are you the
  Lord's head gardener?"</p>

  <p>It was Bones's turn to be shocked.</p>

  <p>"Do not let us discuss it," he said, and with tightly pressed lips they
  walked back to the Residency.</p>

  <p>The Administrator was on the point of departure.</p>

  <p>"Where on earth have you been, Doran?" he asked, though very mildly, for
  he was in some awe of his beautiful daughter.</p>

  <p>"I have been seeing"&mdash;her tone was very deliberate&mdash;"a strange
  insect, and watching its curious antics," said Doran, glancing sideways at
  Bones.</p>

  <p>"So have I," said he defiantly. "One of the most stuck-up insects..."</p>

  <p>She took her father's arm and left him so abruptly that it was quite
  noticeable.</p>

  <p>"Are you coming down to the beach, Bones?" asked Hamilton.</p>

  <p>His subaltern performed a wonderful grimace in which scorn, indifference,
  disgusted amusement and superiority to womankind at once fought for
  expression and suffered defeat. Nevertheless, there were tears in his eyes
  when he saw the white ship go slowly over the horizon, and a lump in his
  throat, and a dull, aching pain in the place where his heart had been. He
  almost wished he could take to drink, but unfortunately whisky made him sick,
  and he invariably fell asleep after his second glass of port.</p>

  <p>"What did you think of her, Bones?" asked Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Not a bad kid," said Bones indifferently. "Rather precocious, but not
  bad."</p>

  <p>"I thought she was beautiful," said Sanders quietly, looking up.</p>

  <p>"Ye-es," admitted Bones, "but looks are nothing. Intelligence is
  everything, dear old Excellency. And, as jolly old Kipling says, I've done
  this, that and the other, and I've learnt about women from her."</p>

  <p>He retired early; refused pointedly Hamilton's invitation to piquet, and
  spent the greater part of the night writing a poem in the tragic
  style.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"You came into my life.<br>
  And I asked you to be my little wife.<br>
  But you went and threw my nose into my face.<br>
  But Heaven made us all, And it made your nose too small.<br>
  But I do not consider that a very great disgrace.</p>

  <p class="verse">"O my heart is sick and empty,<br>
  And soon I'll find a soldier's fate upon a battle-field.<br>
  For when I think of thee,<br>
  Thy lovely figure I'll see,<br>
  And I don't suppose you'll care if I am killed.</p>

  <p class="verse">"So let this be a warning<br>
  (What happened the other morning)<br>
  Don't break a heart that beats for thee, my dear.<br>
  You will never see me again.<br>
  I may be very plain,<br>
  But I'm not such a nut as I appear.</p>

  <p class="verse">"P.S.&mdash;I withdraw all remarks about your nose."</p>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>This epistle may or may not have reached Miss Doran Campbell-Cairns. If it
  did come to her hands, she was so overcome by remorse that she hadn't the
  heart to reply. Whatever was the cause, there was no answer. Bones grew
  cynical about women and began to read the sporting newspapers, whilst his
  interest in Rugby football revived.</p>

  <p>And then there occurred the incident in the village of Ugundi which caused
  him to take a close personal interest in a game that he had not played since
  he was at school.</p>

  <p>Near the village of Ugundi is a place which is called the Ten Leopards. It
  is a spot innocent of shade or herbage, and is surrounded by piles of
  rotting, fungus-covered tree-trunks, which the great elephants, generations
  ago, tore up for their sport and threw to one side. Even at the river's edge
  lie these reminders of the big ones' strength and fancy, for blackened boles
  reach down layer on layer through the sand and mud, and the river has
  cemented them with silt until they are immovable.</p>

  <p>For hundreds of years the elephants came to play on the stark earth, to
  bellow and trumpet their mock defiance, and to wrestle harmlessly at that
  season of the year when even the oldest and most irritable of bulls could
  fight head to head and never be tempted to employ their sharp tusks. Here
  came the calves in herds, to engage in mimic warfare under the eyes of sleepy
  cows, and here, on one memorable day, were found the mangled remains of ten
  leopards*. Perhaps they had stalked a calf, for it was the period of famine.
  But why ten leopards should be found together (being naturally unsociable) is
  a mystery which the ages have not solved.</p>

  <p>[* Sanders put the year at 1763.]</p>

  <p>There was a palaver in the near-by village of Ugundi where Mr.
  Commissioner Sanders sat in judgment on the domestic value of Katabeli, the
  wife of the Akasava chief and the fourteenth known daughter of the Isisi
  king.</p>

  <p>M'laba, the chief, had purchased this woman, paying three sacks of salt,
  two rare and precious dogs and four thousand brass rods, which was a very
  great price for one who was an indifferent dancer. And now M'laba desired the
  return of the treasure he had paid, for the woman had taken her fancy
  elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Sanders listened with patience to the list of her lovers, known and
  suspected, dropping, at long intervals, a pungent word or two upon the morals
  of the Isisi, and at dusk on the third day gave to the husband what was
  equivalent to a decree nisi with the custody of the salt.</p>

  <p>Ordinarily such a palaver might have been settled in a day. Unfortunately,
  there were more than the usual tribal complications, for Katabeli was the
  daughter of a three-mark chief and his wife, and M'laba was a
  two-mark-crossways man. In other words, their faces were, in the one case,
  decorated with three lateral cicatrices, and in the other two in the shape of
  a St. Andrew's cross. The exact complication may not be patent to the casual
  observer, but, reduced to practical politics, the marriage had represented
  first the union between rival races, and secondly that it had united
  (temporarily) the conflicting interests of the League of Saloon Keepers with
  the Good Templars. The Isisi and the Akasava were, in fact, incompatible in
  ethics and concrete practice. And the divorce meant trouble.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the father of the woman, "this is not justice, for my
  daughter has given this man a son, and that alone entitles her to the salt.
  Also, these two-mark-cross-ways men will mock me, and my young men will be
  hard to hold against these haughty Akasava."</p>

  <p>"Whoever mocks you mocks me," said Sanders. "And as for the salt and the
  child, you shall have back as much salt as this child weighs."</p>

  <p>And solemnly the little brown-faced imp of a baby was weighed on the big
  wooden balance against as much salt as turned the scale&mdash;after Sanders
  had removed from the child's little body a belt from which were suspended
  certain heavy pieces of iron.</p>

  <p>"Lord, if these are taken away," said the disgruntled grandfather, "he
  will have bad luck all his life."</p>

  <p>"And if I do not take them away," said Sanders, "you will get too much
  salt, and that would be bad luck indeed for M'laba."</p>

  <p>He left two strong, virile and homicidal people, by no means satisfied
  with his judgment. And it happened that these two were what he called "key
  tribes," and had for generations past been prominent factors in the making of
  war. Between the bloodthirsty Akasava folk and the truculent borderers of the
  Isisi had been the beginning of many sanguinary conflicts which had involved
  whole nations. And Sanders went back to Headquarters feeling more than a
  little uneasy.</p>

  <p>The crops had been very good that year, and good crops are the foundation
  of war. Also, the fish had been abundant in that part of the river, and men
  had grown wealthy between rain and rain. He was so apprehensive that,
  half-way to Headquarters, he stopped the Zaire and swung the vessel round,
  intending to go back and devise on the spot some system of permanent
  conciliation. He thought better of this and resumed his journey. In the first
  place, his return would be a weakness, and incidentally would add to the
  importance of the possible contestants.</p>

  <p>Bones, about this time, had wearied of correspondence schools and had
  grown bored to such an extent that he had even spoken slightingly of the
  newspaper, published in his home town, which invariably printed his
  contributions, no matter upon what subject. And Bones without a hobby was
  rather like a sick cow: he brooded and moped, and made low, clucking noises,
  intended to express his disgust with life and all that life brought to him.
  But Sanders was too occupied with the menace of war to worry about Bones.</p>

  <p>In moments like these he was wont to call a council of himself and his two
  officers, with Ahmet, his chief spy, in attendance. But since he had left
  Ahmet behind to gain intelligence, no decision was reached until that
  incomparable news-gleaner came down the river with his canoe and his hired
  paddlers, and laid before the Commissioner a direful review of the
  situation.</p>

  <p>"Lord, there will be war," he said; "for the woman and her kinsman are
  very hurt against M'laba, and in the eyes of her people she is right. This is
  the way of the Isisi folk, as you know, Sandi: that if a woman goes here or
  there, there is no scandal about it, because the Isisi think such ways are
  human. And as your lordship knows, the Isisi men do not put away their women
  unless they are lazy or cook food so that it hurts a man's inside. I have
  seen new spears in both villages, and M'laba has sent his headman to the
  N'gombi country with fish and salt to buy more."</p>

  <p>"This war must be stopped," said Sanders, "and stopped without
  gun-play."</p>

  <p>He looked at Bones with a thoughtful eye.</p>

  <p>"I have a mind to send you to sit down in the country, Bones," he said. "I
  think your presence might do a whole lot to stop any trouble. If you can hold
  them tight till the rains come, there will be no fighting."</p>

  <p>Bones had a ready-made scheme, and, to Hamilton's surprise, Sanders
  accepted it without question and was even mildly enthusiastic.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't seem possible that you could get these devils to play
  Rugger&mdash;but they're children. You can try, Bones, but to be on the safe
  side you had better send for Bosambo&mdash;I'll feel happier if you have at
  your back a few score of Ochori spears."</p>

  <p>So Bones went up in the Zaire and was deposited near the Place of the Ten
  Leopards, which is a sort of neutral ground between the Akasava and the
  Isisi.</p>

  <p>He came none too soon, he learned after his tents had been pitched; for
  whilst his men were making a rough thorn fence to enclose his little camp,
  Bones strolled into Ugundi and found the young men engaged in warlike
  exercises, under the admiring eyes of their womenfolk.</p>

  <p>The appearance of Bones was unexpected. M'laba, the chief (he was a great
  chief, for there were two thousand souls in his village), had not overlooked
  his coming, for the Place of the Ten Leopards was seldom visited.</p>

  <p>"This comes about, lord Tibbetti," said M'laba, "because of the pride of
  my wife and her father. We are also proud people, and cala cala it is said
  that the Akasava ruled the land from the mountains to the great waters."</p>

  <p>Bones sat on a carved stool before the chief's hut, and the young men who
  had been leaping and dancing stood stock-still and looked foolish.</p>

  <p>"I like you too well, M'laba, to see you hanging on a high tree because of
  such madness," said Bones. "And I have a great thought in my stomach that
  soon I will hold a palaver in the Place of the Leopards and will tell you
  what I desire."</p>

  <p>He went from there to the Isisi village, which was five miles distant, but
  here his arrival had been noted. The Zaire had passed the village on its way
  up-stream, and there were no signs of warlike preparations. The women were
  pounding their corn, and the young men were telling one another dreadful
  stories about their prowess in other directions than war. But there were
  certain signs significant to Bones. Katabeli, the divorced wife of the
  Akasava chief, held an honourable place in the family circle, which is not
  usual in divorced women; and she wore certain anklets and bracelets of brass
  about her comely arms, which showed the favour in which she was held.</p>

  <p>"We do not think of war," said her old father, the chief, "for that would
  be an evil against Sandi. But if these dogs of Akasava attack us, we must
  defend our village because of the women and the children whom they will so
  cruelly use. Now cala cala, Tibbetti, it is said that the Isisi ruled this
  country from the Ghost Mountains..."</p>

  <p>Bones listened patiently, and in the end made a date for a palaver,
  choosing a time that would allow his most valuable ally to come on the
  spot.</p>

  <p>Bosambo, summoned by pigeon, brought three canoes, each controlled by
  twenty paddlers, who became warriors by the simple process of exchanging
  their paddles for spears and shields the moment they touched land. After the
  first greetings Bones explained his high intention, and the two villages were
  called to a palaver and ordered to leave their spears behind them.</p>

  <p>They sat, the Akasava to his left, the Isisi on his right, and between
  them the solid phalanx of Ochori spearsmen, Bosambo squatting at their head,
  and half a dozen yards from Bones.</p>

  <p>As a native orator Lieutenant Tibbetts had few equals. He spoke the
  Bomongo tongue more fluently than Sanders, and he had at his finger-tips all
  the familiar imagery of the river. "Listen, all people," said Bones. "I will
  tell you of a magic which has made my country great. For my people do not
  fight in anger; they strive against one another with a good heart, and
  whosoever wins this striving receives a high reward. Now I want from you,
  chiefs of the Akasava, and you, chiefs of the Isisi, fifteen strong men, very
  supple and wonderfully fleet of foot. And thus we shall do..."</p>

  <p>To translate the theory and practice of Rugby football into Bomongo was
  something of an accomplishment, and Bones succeeded so well that men who had
  come with murder in their hearts went away with no other thought than this
  magic of bloodless fighting.</p>

  <p>It was a great day for Bones, for towards evening came a paddler from
  Headquarters, bringing a letter from Sanders, and, miracle of miracles! a
  large square envelope inscribed in huge letters: "Lieutenant Tibbetts, King's
  Houssas." Instinct would have told him the sender's name even if he had not
  her signature, in large and flamboyant handwriting, in his autograph
  book.</p>

  <p>"Dear Mr. Tibetts (said the letter), I am simply Fearfully Thriled with
  your Poem! How wonderfully clever you must be! I feel I have been a perfect
  Pig to you! Will you ever forgive me? I think your Nose is very hansome! It
  reminds me so much of dear Napoleon Boneypart's! Do please write! I shall be
  here for another month."</p>

  <p>Bones wrote. He gave in outline the scheme he had in his mind. He hinted
  darkly of the terrible danger in which he stood. He spoke with bitter
  self-reproach of his own "boreishness" and hoped she was quite well, as he
  was at present.</p>

  <p>The work of coaching the rival teams went on week; after week. At first
  there were certain difficulties, but they were difficulties of enthusiasm
  rather than of technique; for both Isisi and Akasava took most kindly to the
  game.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday," said an Akasava forward, "when we laid our heads together for
  the little ball to be put under our feet, an Isisi dog pinched me behind. Now
  today I am taking a little knife..."</p>

  <p>Fortunately Bones discovered the "little knife" before the next scrum was
  formed, and kicked the enthusiastic player round the plain of the Ten
  Leopards, which was their practice ground.</p>

  <p>Tackling led to a little unpleasantness.</p>

  <p>"O man," said the exasperated trainer, "if, when you catch the runner with
  the ball, you bite him on the leg, I will beat you till you are sore!"</p>

  <p>"Lord," pleaded the delinquent, "when I threw this man down I fell upon
  him, and he was so easy to bite."</p>

  <p>Bosambo of the Ochori was a fascinated observer of these strange
  happenings.</p>

  <p>"Lord, this game is like war without spears," he said. "Now what will be
  the end of it?"</p>

  <p>Bones explained his scheme. He would have a match before the spectators of
  both villages, who were now rigorously excluded from viewing the proceedings;
  and it would be agreed that whichsoever tribe was vanquished should accept
  defeat. The season was progressing; the rains were near at hand, and the
  murmur of war had sunk down so that it was so faint a whisper that it could
  not be heard in either camp.</p>

  <p>Sanders's approval was a great asset to the young man, but the first joy
  was the scrawled letter and the little wooden box which came up with the
  Commissioner. Doran Campbell-Cairns was just on the point of departure from
  the coast.</p>

  <p>'I think you are simply wonderful (she said). Do write to me in Paris (she
  gave no address). Papa thinks your skeme of Rugger is simply wondirful! I am
  sending you a cup which I bought out of my own pocket-money. It isn't really
  gold, but daddy says the gold will not wear off for years. Do please forgive
  me all I said about your Nose.'</p>

  <p>Bones would have forgiven her anything, and when, later, she became
  engaged to the son of a lordly house he forgave her that.</p>

  <p>The cup was a magnificent one.</p>

  <p>"It might," said Bones, in an awe-stricken voice, "have cost a
  hundred!"</p>

  <p>Later he found the label on the base and was considerably surprised that
  so rare and gorgeous an article could be sold at so small a price.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the match Sanders presided at the great palaver, and the
  atmosphere was almost genial.</p>

  <p>"You really are a remarkable fellow, Bones," he said to the smirking young
  man. "And thank God the glass is going down!" he added inconsequently.</p>

  <p>All the Akasava people within fifty miles, all the Isisi within eighty,
  were assembled on that great plain. They covered the branches of trees; they
  were massed on the gentle slope that goes up to the Isisi woods; for in this
  natural amphitheatre the lot of the sightseer was an easy one.</p>

  <p>"Too many for my liking, and mostly men," said Sanders, glancing
  round.</p>

  <p>He sat before a little tent in a space apart from the people, and before
  him, on a table, was the cup of gold that glittered in the dull rays of the
  sun that shone through watery clouds.</p>

  <p>He sent his soldiers amongst the people to look for arms, but apparently
  they carried nothing more lethal than their long walking-poles. The match
  began in tropical heat, and when Bones blew his whistle and the Isisi pack
  leapt forward, there was such a roar, such a quiver of excitement amongst the
  sightseers, that the thrill of it communicated itself to Sanders.</p>

  <p>To his amazement he found he was watching a very good second-rate ball
  game. The forward work was extraordinarily skilful; the scrums expeditiously
  formed and dispersed. It was when L'mo, a tall Akasava man, tackled an Isisi
  forward and brought him smashing to the ground and knelt on his shoulders,
  that the trouble really started. Two grave spectators leapt out of the press
  and smote L'mo on the head. But even this incident was adjusted and the game
  went on.</p>

  <p>The first penalty goal was kicked against the Isisi, amidst roars of
  approval from the unthinking Isisi onlookers. It was L'mo who caused the
  second incident. Again he tackled, again he brought down his man, but, not
  content with wrenching the ball from his grip, he took the unfortunate
  forward by the ears and was dragging him into the middle of the field when
  Bones interfered.</p>

  <p>Play went on for two minutes, possibly less. And then an Akasava back
  leapt upon an unfortunate rival who was carrying the ball by his teeth, and
  slowly and scientifically began to strangle him. The crowd broke.</p>

  <p>"Back!" roared Sanders.</p>

  <p>Bones flew to the thin line of Houssas and the solid square of Bosambo's
  warriors.</p>

  <p>"No spears, thank God!" said Sanders.</p>

  <p>Before him was a multitude of waving sticks. Little fights were going on
  all over the ground. Groups of Akasava men were at grips with the Isisi.</p>

  <p>"Fix bayonets!" said Bones breathlessly, and into the battling throng the
  bright bayonets made their way, until the howling, fighting multitude were
  divided into two unequal portions.</p>

  <p>And at that moment the blessed rain began to fall, not in dainty showers,
  but in a torrential waterspout that burst suddenly from the grey heavens.
  Bosambo's men were clearing the ground left and right, but there was no
  necessity. The villagers were streaming homeward, nursing their wounds and
  howling their tribal songs.</p>

  <p>"That lets us out," said Sanders.</p>

  <p>He looked round to where the table had been that held the magnificent
  prize, but the table was a mass of splintered wood and the cup had
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>"I hope the winner got it," said Sanders, with a grim smile. "By the way,
  who won?"</p>

  <p>Bones was unable to supply the information, but had he been in the
  waterlogged canoe of Bosambo, as it made its way through the slack waters
  towards the Ochori country, he would not have been at a loss. Bosambo brought
  to Fatima, the sunshine of his soul and his one wife, a lovely gold cup.</p>

  <p>"This Sandi gave me because of my strength and cleverness in a game which
  Tibbetti has taught the nations, and in which I alone excel. From this I will
  drink the beer you brew for me, O dove and light of my eyes!"</p>

     id="chap09">IX. &mdash; THE WISE MAN</a></h2>

  <h3>First published as "Bones and the Ghost Men," <i>The Grand Magazine</i>,
  Vol. 48, Sep 1925-Feb 1926</h3>

  <p class="first">AT rare intervals, once in a hundred years or so, there
  arise from a crowd of charlatans and make-beliefs, magicians of such potency
  that they are remembered when the names of kings and chiefs are forgotten.
  Some such, by the accident of nature, die in their youth and their powers are
  unknown. Others reach maturity and find no call for their gifts, or jealously
  preserve the secrets from their neighbours. Others are misunderstood and pass
  almost automatically into the category of madmen.</p>

  <p>But T'chala, the wise man of the Ochori, had a middle course steered for
  him, for he was the only son of a man rich in stock and salt and brass rods,
  which are the currency of this part of the world; and because he loved his
  fellows and did harm to none, and, if he could not prophesy benevolently,
  would not prophesy at all, he approached the status of holiness, and even
  Sanders, who looked slantwise at all men who claimed to be supernaturally
  gifted, and had a rope or a set of shackles for any who used their reputation
  evilly&mdash;even Sanders spoke fairly to him, and never visited the Upper
  Ochori but he called at the wise man's hut and listened to his
  philosophy.</p>

  <p>"What strange things do you see, T'chala?" he once asked.</p>

  <p>"Lord, in the night I see the dead," said T'chala. "They pass me from left
  to right, a crowd effaces, black and white and yellow, and I am not afraid,
  because they are real, for death is reality and life is a sick man's
  dream."</p>

  <p>"What else?" asked Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Lord, certain things come at my command and speak to me. But that is mad
  talk, and you will put me with the old men on the island, where my brother
  has gone."</p>

  <p>"What do they say to you?" asked Sanders patiently.</p>

  <p>T'chala brooded a moment, his chin on his palm, and then:</p>

  <p>"They tell me that the first thing in all the world is truth," he said,
  "and that all evil grows out of the seed of a lie&mdash;wars and killings and
  pain and death."</p>

  <p>"And do you see M'shimba-M'shamba and a little green lizard?" asked
  Sanders artfully.</p>

  <p>T'chala smiled.</p>

  <p>"That is the great folly of the world," he said, "that people make their
  gods in the shape of men and the things they fear. This is my great thought,
  that gods do not live or hide in the earth or in the sky or in the deep
  waters, but that the earth lives in the gods. Now, Sandi, you will say I am
  mad."</p>

  <p>Sanders laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"I think you are very wise, T'chala," he said, "wiser than many wise men I
  know."</p>

  <p>He gave the man salt and a can of preserved fruit, to which he was very
  partial.</p>

  <p>Soon after this T'chala fell sick of a fever, and because of his great
  holiness and association with devils the people of his village, who loved
  him, concluded it was best to let him die, for fear they offended his many
  deities and familiars by feeding him. So they left him without meat or drink,
  and he would certainly have joined the procession which passed his eyes every
  night, only the wife of a chief, M'lema, out of a fit of contrariness and
  because of her hauteur, carried him food and drink and brought him back from
  the land of ghosts.</p>

  <p>This M'lema was one of two sisters in the Ochori country, being the
  daughter of the oldest wife of a common man who was called N'kema&mdash;as
  all common men are called. M'lema, the elder sister, was tall and beautiful
  by the peculiar standards of the land, and O'fara, the younger, was neither
  tall nor beautiful, so that she was glad to marry an elderly fisherman who
  had his lonely hut on the edge of the shallow lagoon which was called The
  Beard because of the rushes and grasses that bristled on its surface.</p>

  <p>She satisfied all the marital requirements of this old man, and these may
  be stipulated. She dried and smoked the fish he caught; she soaked and
  pounded manioc for his bread; she attended the garden where his mealies grew,
  and cooked for him his morning and evening meals. He was too old a man for
  love, yet strong enough to wield a stick when she failed him; for he thought
  that after a time she would be content to be left alone and count herself
  fortunate when she did not attract his attention.</p>

  <p>O'fara thought the matter out for the greater part of a year, and then she
  found sympathy in a woodman who was young and glad to be alive. In due course
  the matter came before the chief of that district, a rich man who had married
  O'fara's sister. There was no defiance, as they say in more civilised
  communities. O'fara came to the palaver carrying all the evidence on her hip,
  and the old fisherman provided details to the accompaniment of uproarious
  laughter, for the Ochori people are a cannibal stock, and cannibals laugh
  very easily. In the end the chief gave divorce; and since there was no
  wedding portion to restore, nobody suffered but O'fara.</p>

  <p>When she went to her rich sister, M'lema showed her the way past the fire,
  as the saying is.</p>

  <p>"You have brought great shame upon me and my man," she said, in so loud a
  voice that the evidence straddling O'fara's hip opened its sleepy eyes and
  surveyed his aunt solemnly. "You are an evil woman and there is no place for
  you in my hut."</p>

  <p>So O'fara went to the woods and slept in an old hut that had once held a
  dead man and was therefore abandoned, and here she lived and her child
  learned to walk. She had some skill with the line, and in the dark of night
  caught fish, till the fishermen found her. She ran fast enough from them, but
  one fleeter than the rest kept on her heels as she doubled hither and
  thither, and ran her to bay on the banks of the river.</p>

  <p>"Now, woman," he said, "I know what devil frightened away the fish from
  the river, so that I and my brothers must go to the Isisi country before we
  make catch."</p>

  <p>He tied her wrist and ankle (she was too winded to struggle) and by this
  time the other fishermen came up, and after each man had beaten her with his
  leather girdle, they had a conference in the early light of morning as to
  what should be done with her. The delay was fatal to any plan, for round the
  bluff came the white hull of the Zaire, the blue ensign with the golden crown
  drooping over the throbbing stern-wheel. And Sanders, who had wonderful eyes,
  and a more wonderful pair of prismatic glasses, saw the group and sent the
  shallow boat into the bank.</p>

  <p>"Lord, this woman frightened away the fish in the river; and she is evil,
  for when she was the wife of K'raviki, the fisherman, she did so-and-so and
  so-and-so."</p>

  <p>"O, ko!" said Sanders, politely amazed. O'fara got up to her feet stiffly,
  feeling her hurts. "Tell me, man," said Sanders to the chief fisherman, "how
  many times did you beat this woman?" The uneasy little headman hazarded a
  guess. "That number of times you shall be beaten, and as many again," said
  Sanders gently. He snapped two fingers, and Sergeant Abiboo took off his coat
  and rolled up his sleeves...</p>

  <p>Sanders went into the forest where the woman's child was and took them
  back to the Zaire. An hour later he saw the chief of the big village where
  was O'fara's sister, so encumbered with brass anklets and bangles that she
  rattled as she walked.</p>

  <p>"Chief, I see you," Sanders greeted him, and took and tasted the salt that
  the man held in the hollow of two hands. "I bring you this woman and this
  child. She shall sit down in your village and no man shall harm her."</p>

  <p>The chief was not pleased; his wife, less in awe of a man, was shrill.</p>

  <p>"O'fara is a scandalous woman," she said; "and Sandi does not know that
  when she was the wife of K'raviki the fisherman..."</p>

  <p>Sanders saw the approving nods of the women.</p>

  <p>"Bring me a bowl of goat's milk," he said; and, when it was brought: "Let
  any wife drink of this," he said, "and if she has no lover but her husband,
  the milk will stay white; but if she has a lover it will turn black."</p>

  <p>M'lema's hand was half-way out&mdash;but now it drew back.</p>

  <p>"Lord, this is magic, and I am frightened," she whimpered.</p>

  <p>Sanders held the bowl towards the awe-stricken audience, but the women
  shrank away. A sardonic smile broke upon his face.</p>

  <p>"O virtuous wives!" he mocked. "Who is there virtuous here?"</p>

  <p>The wide-eyed baby on O'fara's hip made a little sound, and Sanders held
  the bowl to its lips.</p>

  <p>"White&mdash;it remains," he said; "for this one has no sin."</p>

  <p>He looked straightly at the chief.</p>

  <p>"What shall I do with O'fara?" he asked; and M'lema's husband, with a face
  like thunder, answered: "Let her stay, lord Sandi; by my head and life she
  shall be safe. As to my wife, I know what I know&mdash;but I shall know
  more."</p>

  <p>Again the cold eyes met his.</p>

  <p>"In a moon I come to you for a palaver, chief. I would have you sitting by
  my side; but if you sit before me, I shall do justice."</p>

  <p>A sufficient warning for Sabaya, who contented himself with the use of an
  admonitory stick.</p>

  <p>That night, when her husband had gone with his men to the woods to shoot
  monkeys, M'lema met her lover, a young man to whom she was as a god. He was
  an Akasava man and familiar with holy things, for he was missionary-trained
  and had met M'lema in the days when he was a lay preacher&mdash;which was
  before Father Beggelli found him out.</p>

  <p>"Go secretly tonight," she said, "to T'chala, the wise man, who lives at
  the very end of the village. And because he loves me&mdash;for when he was
  sick I went to him and gave him food and goat's milk&mdash;he will do many
  things for me. Tell him that Sandi has shamed me because of my sister,
  O'fara, and he must put a magic upon O'fara so that she withers up and grows
  old and dies, she and the child of the woodman."</p>

  <p>Bologa, the Akasava man, was alarmed.</p>

  <p>"That is a bad palaver," he said. "Let the woman stay, for she will be
  taken on a blessed day when the sheep and the goats are divided&mdash;this
  the God-man told us."</p>

  <p>The woman did not urge him, she ordered, and obediently the lover went to
  the hut of T'chala and found him sitting before his door in the cool of the
  evening, with a far-away look in his eyes, for he was thinking of truth.</p>

  <p>He listened whilst Bologa spoke in his roundabout way, and all the time
  T'chala's face was immobile and expressionless. Presently the lover came back
  to where he had left the woman.</p>

  <p>"This man is mad," he said, "for he talked only of truth and of lying, and
  when I asked him if he would do this thing, he said it was evil, and evil was
  not for such a man as he."</p>

  <p>"Go back to this old dog," said M'lema urgently, "and tell him that when
  Sandi comes he must say no word of what you have said. I wish I had left him
  to die."</p>

  <p>Bologa returned to the hut of the wise man and delivered his message.</p>

  <p>"If he asks me I must speak," said T'chala simply. "For a lie is like the
  little snake that breaks in two and becomes two snakes, so that, if they are
  not killed, all the world crawls with them."</p>

  <p>M'lema, in a panic, could think of only one solution to her problem. In
  the middle of the night, when T'chala slept, the lover, who was a member of
  the Yellow Ghosts, went down to the river, to the place where the clay was,
  kneaded a large lump and, creeping into the old man's hut, pressed it over
  his face, and lay upon him for a reasonable time, until his spasmodic
  jerkings grew still. And that, thought M'lema, was the end of wisdom. Yet,
  when she went out in the morning, expecting to find a crowd of mourners about
  the hut, there, in the morning sunlight, sat T'chala, his hands clasped
  before him, his far-away eyes fixed upon the truth.</p>

  <p>The lover, grey with fear, heard the news, and would have fled into the
  forest, only there came word from T'chala that he had need of the man; and he
  went fearfully.</p>

  <p>"Bologa, I see you," said T'chala gravely. "But because of your evil no
  other man shall see you from this day."</p>

  <p>Bologa, sick with terror, walked back along the village street, and came
  to a family group where his brother sat.</p>

  <p>"O, ko!" he said. "A terrible thing has happened to me."</p>

  <p>But his brother did not look up or answer, and nobody in the village
  seemed conscious of his presence. He stooped down and touched the shoulder of
  the man, but his hand had no weight or substance. He screamed aloud in his
  fear, but nobody heard him.</p>

  <p>"O people, listen!" he shrieked...</p>

  <p>Not a head turned.</p>

  <p>Frantically he flew along the village street and saw M'lema sitting alone
  before her hut, watching a boiling pot.</p>

  <p>"M'lema," he whimpered, "the old man has put his magic upon me."</p>

  <p>She neither raised her eyes nor her head, and when, with a howl of fear,
  he gripped her arm, his hands closed on nothing.</p>

  <p>This was the story he told when they brought him to the little island.</p>

  <p>"And the curious thing was," said Sanders, when the story came round to
  him, "that all the people who saw Bologa swear that he did not move from the
  front of T'chala's hut, but that he sat there for the greater part of an
  hour. Undoubtedly he was mad when they took him away. You might look him up
  the next time you go to the Ochori, Bones, and see if you can get sense out
  of him."</p>

  <p>When old or young men went silly, it was the custom, from time immemorial,
  to put out their eyes, if they were not already blind, and lead them to a
  place convenient for the prowling leopards; and when Mr. Commissioner Sanders
  checked this practice, there were many old people, though they might
  themselves be the sufferers in a few years' time, who protested bitterly
  against this unwarrantable interference with the liberty of the subject.</p>

  <p>Bosambo of the Ochori governed his country with a rod of iron, and woe to
  those who broke the law he gave! For he was a very fast walker and could
  outpace the longest-legged soldier of his country; and always he carried his
  wicker shield and the six little throwing-spears that never failed to get
  home. And when he passed on the word of his master, that the old way with the
  aged was taboo, young men grumbled and obeyed.</p>

  <p>A new method was found for disposing of aged relatives. A tiny village was
  built for them on a broad peninsula that jutted out into the river, and which
  was connected to the shore by a narrow strip of land. Every morning, men
  appointed for the purpose brought food for I the silly folk, and a guard was
  set on the isthmus to prevent the decrepit ones from reaching the mainland.
  It was a good scheme and was born in the fertile mind of Lieutenant Tibbetts
  of the King's Houssas. But it had this disadvantage over the earlier method:
  that it gave crazy people an opportunity of meeting one another and of
  discussing their pet abominations. By common consent they fixed upon a lanky
  youth who wore a monocle, even in his sleep.</p>

  <p>"This man," said Bologa, a mere stripling, but, by reason of his magical
  experience, a person of importance, "has treated us cruelly, for he has put
  us in prison. Now, in the days of my father we sent old men into the forest,
  where they were free, and we made it so that they could not see the terrible
  beasts that prowl at night."</p>

  <p>His hearers agreed. There were seven old men and Bologa sitting in a
  semicircle around a large fire, and they had fed well: the Government was
  generous, and some of them had relatives who brought them food. They talked
  aimlessly about Bones far into the night. Two of the old men fell asleep; two
  were heavily engaged in conversation with the invisible spirits that visited
  them; but the other three listened eagerly.</p>

  <p>"You are old and weak; he is young and strong. And am I not strong also?
  And shall not the strength of eight little dogs pull down a leopard?"</p>

  <p>With some difficulty they awakened the two sleepers and told them of their
  plan, which, briefly, was to catch Bones on one of his visits, overpower him,
  and deal with him in six various ways, for each of the old men had his own
  pet idea. It might have gone out of their crazy minds, but unfortunately
  Bones came on the morrow, a smirk on his angular face, his large monocle
  reflecting the light of the westering sun.</p>

  <p>"Ah, there you are, you jolly old souls!" said Bones, who came quite
  alone, having left the Zaire at a wooding three miles away. "Happy and
  content and full of beans!"</p>

  <p>The guard at the far end of the isthmus had not been on duty when he
  passed; had, in point of fact, been to a wedding feast at the village, and he
  neither saw the young man come nor go.</p>

  <p>The first intimation of danger came when a thin and wiry arm was flung
  round Bones's neck and two knobbly knees were pressed suddenly into his back.
  Had it been in the open, the thing could have been seen; but he was in the
  common hut inspecting the arrangements he had made for their comfort.</p>

  <p>And here Bones might have ended his career in a most unpleasant manner;
  but there happened along the great war-craft of Bosambo, king of the Ochori,
  and the chant of his paddlers reached the ears of the crazy men, and,
  childlike, they abandoned their task and went to the edge of the water to
  watch the wonderful canoe with its banging drums and its scarlet awning (once
  the curtain dividing Sanders's sleeping-cabin from his work-room) and clap
  their hands in time to the magnificent rhythm of twenty-four paddlers dipping
  their scarlet blades into the water like one.</p>

  <p>Bosambo would have gone past, only he saw that all the crazy men were
  armed. His canoe swung in and he leapt lightly ashore.</p>

  <p>"O ghost men, what is this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Lord Bosambo," said Bologa, "we have Tibbetti in that hut and we are
  going to do so-and-so and so-and-so."</p>

  <p>And the other seven nodded and repeated each his own formula.</p>

  <p>In three strides Bosambo was in the hut, had cut the cord about the neck
  of the choking young man, and had hauled him into the daylight.</p>

  <p>"Lord, what shall I do with these old fools and the young fool who is most
  foolish of all?" he asked. "They are crazy and are better dead. Now, if you
  say the word, I will ask them to come into the great hut, and as each man
  enters he will die and never know."</p>

  <p>"You're a wicked old murderer!" said the indignant Bones, and Bosambo
  beamed.</p>

  <p>"I be Christian man same like Marki-Luki-Johnni," he said. "I go heaven
  one-time, you go heaven one-time, howdjedo!"</p>

  <p>He gave a passable imitation of himself welcoming Bones to a better
  world.</p>

  <p>Bones had had a scare: one of the worst that had ever come to him, for
  there was an eerie ugliness about this danger which left a deeper impression
  upon his mind than other and worse perils.</p>

  <p>All the way to Headquarters he pondered on the most acceptable reward he
  could offer to Bosambo. The chief, whom he had consulted, was frankness
  itself.</p>

  <p>"Lord, give me money," he said, "for every time I see the great king's
  face upon a silver coin, my heart grows very strong for him."</p>

  <p>But Bones had other views.</p>

  <p>"Why not," suggested his cynical superior (and Captain Hamilton could be
  very cynical indeed), "why not an illuminated address? Or a set of
  fish-knives? Or a marble clock with or without gilt angels?"</p>

  <p>"Don't let us drag in religion, dear old sir," begged Bones gravely. "Let
  us keep our naughty old minds in the strait an' narrow, dear old agnostic.
  Bosambo&mdash;by gum!"</p>

  <p>He slapped his palm with a skinny fist, and in another second had leapt
  down the steps of the Residency and was flying across the sun-baked parade
  ground. In a little time he returned, flushed efface and smirking; under each
  arm he carried a thick package of magazines. These he laid on the table.</p>

  <p>"I know what you're giving him," said Hamilton; "a gramophone&mdash;five
  shillings down and ten shillings a month for the term of your natural
  life?"</p>

  <p>Bones shook his head.</p>

  <p>"A correspondence course in salesmanship&mdash;sign the blank and send no
  money?" suggested Hamilton.</p>

  <p>"Wrong, old guess-works."</p>

  <p>"Wait!" Hamilton clasped his forehead. "It can't be gents' suitings
  ready-to-wear... an electric torch&mdash;touch the button and release
  sunlight?"</p>

  <p>"No, dear old officer, captain and friend."</p>

  <p>Sanders, looking over the top of his Times, hazarded a guess.</p>

  <p>"Something to do with paint, Bones?"</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Tibbetts's jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>"How did you know that, Excellency?"</p>

  <p>Sanders laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"For three weeks before you went up-river you had been sounding me about
  decorating my fine house," he said dryly, "and for three weeks I had been
  trying to avert the disaster."</p>

  <p>"Paint?" repeated Hamilton incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Stencils," said Bones, and waded through the literature.</p>

  <p>It took him till dinner-time to find the advertisement:</p>

  <p>"MAKE YOUR HOME BEAUTIFUL.</p>

  <p>"Missouri Man makes $100.00 a week in spare time. You can do the
  same."</p>

  <p>It was an advertizement of "Eezy Paynt":</p>

  <p>"Not a Toy, but a MONEY MAKER"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact. Ham," confessed Bones, "I'd already ordered No. 3
  outfit, hoping, dear old sir, that you wouldn't mind a little art."</p>

  <p>"On the whole," said Sanders gravely, "I think it would be wiser to hand
  the outfit to Bosambo. I've no doubt he will make good use of it. And, on
  your way up-country, see T'chala and give him a tin of preserves. There, by
  the favour of heaven, is the only wise head in the Ochori!"</p>

  <p>"Clever men are easy fallers," said Hamilton.</p>

  <p>Sanders shook his head.</p>

  <p>"T'chala is different. If he were a white man he would be remarkable. The
  man is a true philosopher."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what a man is afraid of," said the cynical Hamilton, "and I will
  weigh up his philosophy!"</p>

  <p>"He is afraid of nothing," said Sanders.</p>

  <p>"The same as me," murmured Bones.</p>

  <p>A month later, he explained to the fascinated paramount chief the art and
  practice of stencilling. They were on the forebridge of the Zaire, which had
  dropped Sanders at the Isisi city, and Bones had a whole day to spare.</p>

  <p>"Lord, this is a wonder," breathed Bosambo. "For you put these little
  pieces of yellow paper and you jigger with your brush, and lo! there is a
  picture of a beautiful flower, so real that a man may smell it!"</p>

  <p>"And a man on horseback," murmured Bones. "Don't forget the jolly old man
  on the jolly old horse, Bosambo. And a windmill, dear old savage."</p>

  <p>Bosambo was too entranced by the new toy to be lured into English. "Now
  all the people of the Ochori will see how great a magician I am," he said.
  "Even T'chala, the wise man, cannot paint a flower with his eyes shut."</p>

  <p>This happened at a period when the Ochori, with every excuse in their
  favour, had denied the full quota of taxation to their master. There was a
  goat sickness and a blight on their corn; fish were scarce, and had moved to
  other waters. But the truth of it was that there was in the Ochori an
  epidemic of passive resistance, and the movement was so general that Bosambo
  hesitated to use force to extract from his tight-fisted nation the due which
  was his and Government's&mdash;especially his.</p>

  <p>For the greater part of a week Bosambo sat with his wonderful box of
  stencils, and experimented and thought, and then one night his great lokali
  sent a message throughout the land, calling chiefs and headmen to a great
  palaver of state.</p>

  <p>They came, albeit reluctantly, and prepared to contest the inevitable
  claims for further taxation, and they were surprised and delighted when
  Bosambo's headmen gave them private word that no question of taxes was to be
  discussed.</p>

  <p>In the morning Bosambo sat in his chair of state under the thatched roof
  of the palaver house, and addressed the squatting half-moon of listeners.</p>

  <p>"All people, listen!" he bellowed. "Sandi, who is my friend, and Tibbetti,
  who is like my brother, have made a palaver with me. And Sandi said this:
  'There are good men in the Ochori and there are bad men. Put a mark upon the
  good, that when I meet them I may know and reward them. For this is the order
  of the great king who is my father.'"</p>

  <p>The Ochori were suspicious and puzzled, and yet they understood the theory
  of markings; for did not all the petty chiefs wear silver medals about their
  necks in proof of their greatness? One old man, a notorious sinner, who had
  escaped the rope on two occasions by the fraction of an inch, rose up from
  the assembly and saluted.</p>

  <p>"Bosambo," he said, "That is a good talk. Though people have spoken
  against me evilly, yet I love Sandi, as you well know. Mark me, that I may go
  back to my city and show my people this wonder."</p>

  <p>"That indeed I will, Osaku," said Bosambo readily, "and the four hundred
  matakos that you shall pay me for this honour, and which I will send to our
  lord Sandi, will be as nothing to a man of your great wealth."</p>

  <p>Osaku jibbed at this, but the possibilities were alluring. He compromised
  for three hundred matakos, and, lying flat on his stomach, allowed Bosambo to
  stencil a beautiful green windmill on his left shoulder-blade.</p>

  <p>All day long Bosambo harangued and painted. Some of the headmen had
  brought no brass rods with them, and pleaded for credit; but the wily master
  of the Ochori was adamant to all such pleas. This question of decoration, he
  said in effect, was to be conducted on a strictly cash basis.</p>

  <p>There were sceptics, but the majority, having seen the miracle performed,
  and having followed those who were marked and blessed, the better to observe
  the roses, windmills and baggy-trousered Dutchmen which ornamented their
  fellows, departed instantly for home to gather their treasures.</p>

  <p>Many came who were not decorated. T'chala, the wise man of the Ochori,
  walked ten miles through the forest to witness the markings, but when Bosambo
  saw him he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"These marks are for silly people who have no virtue, lord Bosambo," he
  said. "Now I am wise and I have knowledge of life and death, and I know that
  life is a dream and death is real. I neither seek reward nor punishment."</p>

  <p>"I will do this for you because I love you," said Bosambo, who needed the
  testimonial of the wise man's approval, so that when the day came that
  Sanders called him to account he might point to T'chala as a disciple. "Also,
  these magic signs will give you long life and great safety."</p>

  <p>But T'chala smiled gravely and went away.</p>

  <p>On the third day came the petty chief who was husband of M'lema, and he
  brought his wife with him. In return for a hundred matakos and a small bag of
  salt he had the privilege of bearing a glistening red cow across his stomach.
  But when he pushed forward his shrinking wife, Bosambo wiped the sweat from
  his forehead and put down his overworked paint-brush.</p>

  <p>"This woman I will not mark," he said, knowing well the chief's foolish
  love for the girl; "for our lord Sandi has spoken against her."</p>

  <p>"Bosambo," urged the chief, "she is a woman and, being a woman, has no
  sense. Now I will give you a thousand matakos and two goats if you put upon
  her the highest mark, so that when Sandi sees her he shall speak to her
  kindly."</p>

  <p>Bosambo haggled for another goat, got it, and decorated her in a novel
  manner.</p>

  <p>"Bosambo," protested the chief, "how can men see this wonderful mark? For
  she is not a shameless N'gombi woman who walks without proper clothing."</p>

  <p>Bosambo recognised the force of the argument, and repeated his design on
  the nape of the woman's neck.</p>

  <p>Later came O'fara, the penniless and friendless; and Bosambo, who had no
  sentiment, and was moreover running short of paint, waved her loftily to
  oblivion.</p>

  <p>"These high mysteries are not for you, O'fara. Go find your woodman and
  let him bring me a bag of salt or such other treasures as woodmen bury in the
  ground."</p>

  <p>So the sorrowful O'fara went back to the village and her solitude. And
  there she found T'chala the wise brooding on truth, and she sat down at his
  feet and told him of her poverty. T'chala was unusually distrait.</p>

  <p>"I saw one mark like a great tree that Bosambo put upon an old man's
  chest, and this gave him long life," he roused, and glanced at the girl.
  "What need have you, woman, that Bosambo can fill? You are young&mdash;there
  you have all. Now I am a very old man, and I never pass a grave by the
  river's side but I stop to think what place will they dig for me. And life
  comes and goes like the sun. It is no sooner morning than it is night... a
  great red tree with branches that ran so."</p>

  <p>She continued to lament her failure to be branded to the favour of
  Sandi.</p>

  <p>"That I do not desire," he said, a trifle impatiently for such a holy man;
  "for Sandi loves me because of my wisdom, and I am very high above common
  men... Life is a dream, but some men love dreaming. And death is
  real&mdash;but who desires reality when there are dreams?..."</p>

  <p>News of the marking came to the little strip of land where the mad folks
  dwelt, and Bologa, the Akasava, chafing at his injustice, saw here a
  fulfilment of the God-man's promise. And a great idea taking shape in his
  mind, he carried out a plan. In the dead of the night he crept past the
  sleeping guard and, making his way to a fishing village, he stole a canoe and
  passed down the river till he came to his own land, to find that from one end
  of the country to the other the Akasava were in a state of ferment. He did
  not see the Zaire chasing north at full speed, her black smoke-stack belching
  sparks. Her decks were alive with soldiers, and about her two guns the
  shrapnel shells were stacked in rows, for the smell of war had reached the
  keen nostrils of Mr. Commissioner Sanders.</p>

  <p>The story of the markings had gone up and down the river like wildfire,
  and each tribe had placed its own interpretation upon the favours shown to
  the Ochori. Bologa sought the king of the Akasava and expounded his
  theory.</p>

  <p>"The God-man said this, that some should be marked as sheep and some as
  goats, and who are the sheep but the Ochori? For they were great cowards, as
  you well know, until Bosambo came. And this is the mystery, that all who are
  so marked shall be masters of our people and we shall be slaves to them, just
  as the God-man foretold."</p>

  <p>"This is a bad palaver," said the king of the Akasava, his face darkening.
  "Let us go up to these sheep and make a killing."</p>

  <p>Sanders was only twenty miles away when the Akasava king gathered a
  thousand spears from his own city, and in the dark of a rainy night passed up
  the river to the first great village of the Ochori. The lokali rang out the
  alarm at daybreak, and Bosambo moved swiftly to the rescue of his ravaged
  domains. He flung his finest regiment through the smoking village and drove
  the Akasava spears in flight to their canoes and to the Zaire that came in
  sight as they paddled to midstream. In the heat of the afternoon Sanders
  accompanied a sobered Bosambo through the ruin. One house stood intact, and
  before this sat the unmarked O'fara.</p>

  <p>"Lord, they did not kill me because I had no magic mark upon me. But
  M'lema they slew, also the chief, her husband, for they came upon us in
  grey-light and the people were sleeping."</p>

  <p>"Where is T'chala, for this is his hut?" said Sanders. "And well I know
  that this wise man escaped the ruin."</p>

  <p>Without a word she turned and walked into the hut, and Sanders
  followed.</p>

  <p>T'chala was dead; the brass hilt of the broad-bladed elephant knife that
  killed him stuck out from the branches of a big red tree that was crudely
  painted on his breast.</p>

  <p>"This magic painting I did because he asked me, and brought me camwood and
  oil, and showed me how the magic tree was made," said O'fara, "for he feared
  death very greatly."</p>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">X. &mdash; THE SWEET SINGER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Lieutenant Tibbetts had a great educational idea he
  usually reduced it to writing. The Residency saw little of him and heard
  nothing, for at meal-times he was very silent and taciturn, not to say
  irritable. He was like this when he elaborated his scheme for translating
  into the Bomongo tongue the nursery rhymes of his youth. For Bones was a
  restless educationalist, and if he was not acquiring knowledge he was never
  so happy as when he was passing along the fruits of his study. His nursery
  rhymes were not too successful:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Miri-miri had a small goat<br>
  With white hair.<br>
  When Miri-miri walked by the river<br>
  The goat also walked.<br>
  It went to all place behind Miri-miri"&mdash;</p>

  <p>was the literal translation of "Mary had a little lamb," and Bones made an
  heroic effort to teach the children of the Isisi, the Akasava and the Ochori
  this legend.</p>

  <p>"Lord," complained one of the petty chiefs of the Isisi, "Tibbetti came
  here and he called the children to a palaver, thus putting us men to shame.
  Then he made them say certain things about a white goat, and as you know,
  Sandi, a white goat is a terrible thing that brings bad luck. Therefore we
  kill them when they are born. And since our children have learned this magic
  saying, our crops have failed and the rubber trees have dried up. Also one of
  the little children has died of a cough and another has fallen into the
  river."</p>

  <p>Nor was Bones more successful in his efforts to lead the immature minds of
  little Akasava boys to an appreciation of "Tom, Tom, the Piper's Son." There
  was a complaint that he was teaching the Akasava children to steal pigs.</p>

  <p>"I think you had better leave their education in the hands of the
  missionaries, Bones," said Sanders. "The trouble with our people is that they
  take things too literally."</p>

  <p>So the Bomongo translations were scrapped, and he sought around for new
  inspiration.</p>

  <p>"The man is tireless," said Hamilton. "Gosh! If I had his energy I'd work
  an engine! He spent all this morning reading me jokes from Snappy Stuff,
  which, I understand, is published in America. And Bones is getting ideas out
  of these wretched American journals&mdash;he called me a 'tight-wad'
  yesterday morning&mdash;I'll stand that, but if he calls me 'kid' again I'll
  search for the humane killer!"</p>

  <p>Those paragraphs in the popular periodical press which are too short to
  tell the truth, exercise an uncanny fascination over a certain type of
  reader. Bones invariably reserved the page headed "Things that are not
  generally known" until the last. It was the old port and cigar of life's
  dinner. Hunched up at the table where his patent Ski-Lite reading lamp
  sometimes burnt and sometimes smoked, he read:</p>

  <p>The amount of the National Debt in pennies would, if placed end to end,
  reach three times round the world.</p>

  <p>There are more acres in Yorkshire than words in the Bible.</p>

  <p>500,000 per annum is earned in royalties by English playwrights.</p>

  <p>Ink was invented by&mdash;etc., etc.</p>

  <p>It may have been imagination on his part, or it may have been that the
  editor of "Things that are not generally known" had a working arrangement
  with the editor of "Queer Facts that are seldom realised," or that both were
  hand in glove with the gentleman who directed the page in another paper that
  was titled "Information in a Nut-shell," but certainly Bones was always
  meeting that inspiring paragraph about authors' fees.</p>

  <p>On a Sunday afternoon, when Sanders and the two soldiers were loafing on
  the stoep, waiting and praying for the inevitable thunderstorm which had
  threatened all day, Bones struggled up in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Ham, old limpus, I'm goin' to write a play!"</p>

  <p>Bones usually chose such moments as these for his most startling
  announcements. The heat and the airlessness of the muggiest day never reduced
  his mind to cabbage-level or sapped his vital juices.</p>

  <p>Hamilton turned a moist face and a pleading eye in his direction.</p>

  <p>"Wait till it's cooler. Bones," he begged. "Be a good fellow and shut up
  till the rain comes&mdash;I thought I heard thunder just now."</p>

  <p>"Off?" suggested Bones. "Thunder off, dear old dramatist?"</p>

  <p>Hamilton groaned.</p>

  <p>"Why not a play about the Territories?" demanded Bones. "This is the plot.
  A young an' good-lookin' but perfectly jolly old lieutenant&mdash;the hero,
  Ham&mdash;is fearfully hated by his naughty old captain, Ham. When things go
  wrong it's always the jolly old lieutenant who gets people out of a mess and
  always the wicked old skipper who gets the credit. Do you follow me,
  Ham?"</p>

  <p>Hamilton closed his eyes and moaned.</p>

  <p>"Then a nice old lady comes to the station. Ham&mdash;beautiful eyes,
  beautiful hair, beautiful figure, an' naturally she falls desperately in love
  with the jolly old subaltern. Listenin', Ham?"</p>

  <p>Hamilton's eyes were closed.</p>

  <p>"Listenin', dear old sir?"</p>

  <p>Hamilton moaned again.</p>

  <p>"But this jolly old subaltern is fearfully honourable. He knows that
  &mdash;oh, I forgot to tell you, Ham&mdash;that this beautiful old lady's
  father doesn't like the jolly old officer an' that she's really not his
  daughter. What I mean is, there's a villain named Captain Dark. Now, how do
  you think. Ham, old sir, this jolly young subaltern saves the girl?"</p>

  <p>"Which girl?" asked Hamilton drowsily.</p>

  <p>"The girl I'm talking about. A ghost warns her!"</p>

  <p>"And what does she do to the goat?" murmured his superior.</p>

  <p>Bones made a noise indicative of annoyance.</p>

  <p>"Ghost&mdash;G-O-S-T, ghost. He's physic&mdash;the jolly old subaltern, I
  mean."</p>

  <p>Hamilton opened one eye. "Has physic?"</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut. Ham! Physic! He could see ghosts an' things like that
  &mdash;call 'em up, dear old officer." Bones snapped his finger in
  illustration. "Ghost, ghost, ghost! an' up they popped. This play will make a
  fortune. Ham. There hasn't been a physic hero before&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Psychic, you poor frog!" snarled Hamilton. "And let me sleep, will
  you?"</p>

  <p>A flicker of white lightning behind the Residency wood, a rumble that
  rolled loudly to a deafening, head-splitting crash, and Hamilton opened his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"There she blows!" he said cheerfully. "Oh, smell the loverly wind!"</p>

  <p>The dust on the parade ground was swirling in little spirals, the roar of
  the distant rain came to them before the first big drops fell.</p>

  <p>Sanders woke from a doze, reached for his cigar-case and lit a black
  cheroot, a smile in his tired eyes.</p>

  <p>"This naughty old father, Ham, wants the girl to marry the other fellow,
  an' of course the handsome old lieutenant knows this an' he jolly well won't
  have anything to do with her&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come inside, you talkative devil," said Hamilton, rising lazily as the
  rain came down. "And if you put me in a play I'll break your infernal
  head!"</p>

  <p>With Bones, to think was to act. Before the storm had passed he was
  committing to paper his immense idea.</p>

  <p>Scene I. A uell-knowen Residency.</p>

  <p>Enter Lieutenant Harold Darcey.</p>

  <p>Lieut.H.D. Ah. Nobody here. Nobodey here. The golly old place is deserted.
  Now for a wisky and soder. (Pours out a viisky and soder). Ah! I mustnt waist
  time. My studys my studdis studdies must come first.</p>

  <p>(Enter Dorman Mackalyster, a yung and butiful girl lovely eyes etc.)</p>

  <p>D. M.&mdash;Oh, I didn't know you were here were here Lt. Darcey. Oh how I
  love you.</p>

  <p>Lt. H. D.&mdash;It can never be dear old Dorman our ways ways lay far
  apart you are pleged to annother anotther Fairwell. I am Physic. I know that
  it can never be.</p>

  <p>D. M.&mdash;Oh do not leaf me Harold. Their is something you ort aught
  ourt to know. My farther is not my father is not my farther but a foundling
  that adopted me when I was but a child.</p>

  <p>(Enter Captain Dark.)</p>

  <p>Copt. D.&mdash;Ah what are you doing alown with this man alone. Curse you
  Harold I will rune ruing ruin your life.</p>

  <p>Somewhere about midnight, when Hamilton was going to bed. Bones brought
  the first act. "Read it. Ham, old sir," he said a little nervously. "Just
  tell me what you think of it. Give me your candid view, Ham. Personally, I
  think it's the best play I ever wrote."</p>

  <p>"How many have you written?" asked his astonished superior.</p>

  <p>"It's the first, dear old critic," replied Bones shamelessly.</p>

  <p>Hamilton turned the ink-stained manuscript. "I'll read it in bed," said
  the mendacious man. In the morning he had time to read the first act. "It's a
  rotten play," was his criticism at breakfast. "The spelling is quite normal
  in places, but otherwise it has no redeeming features."</p>

  <p>Bones sneered. "Ah ha! You recognised yourself, dear old Captain Dark!
  Naturally, dear old sorebones, you didn't like it. But when you see the
  second act&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There will be no second act," said Hamilton firmly.</p>

  <p>"You don't know old Bones," said Bones, who did know old Bones.</p>

  <p>The veto came from an unexpected quarter. Sanders objected mildly and
  gently to the development of the plot.</p>

  <p>"If you write about a party of American scientists being refused admission
  to the Territory and it gets into print, I shall be kicked," he said. "It is
  highly dramatic, but it is bad history."</p>

  <p>Bones started to rewrite the second act&mdash;and a young dramatist who
  starts in to rewrite second acts usually writes no more. As for the affair
  with the American expedition&mdash;</p>

  <p>All British officials are inclined to be a little supercilious to the
  foreigner and disobliging to their own kind.</p>

  <p>Mr. Commissioner Sanders was not popular with outsiders, because he hated
  interference of all kinds and turned a hard face to all strangers. Across the
  Territories might have been written in letters a mile high. "No admittance
  except on business." He had turned down more exploration parties, more
  prospectors and more traders than any ten commissioners in Africa. He had had
  sermons preached against him in missionary circles, and had been most
  offensively prayed for; he had been reported and paragraphed, and very
  unpleasant leading articles had been written about him. But his policy of
  non-interference was one that had the sneaking approval of his superiors,
  though occasionally he had found himself in conflict with the powers.</p>

  <p>Notably in the case of the Cress-Rainer expedition, which set out from the
  United States with the official benison of the British Ambassador. They were
  specimen-hunting, and undoubtedly the Territory was rich in strange mammals
  and unclassified bugs. But Sanders had shut the door, and rightly. It was the
  time of the big war which decimated the nations and crept southward, even to
  the doors of the Residency. There was a rumpus about this, but in the weary
  end Sanders had triumphed and the expedition went down to Angola.</p>

  <p>Yet Sanders liked Americans, and, for all his so-called antagonism to "the
  work," loved one missionary who was not only American but of German origin.
  He would have given half his pay to have kept this homely, middle-aged woman
  under his eyes. But this was not to be.</p>

  <p>When Mrs. Kleine of Cincinnati left the Isisi people there were loud
  lamentations, for she was a God-mama so well beloved that a whole nation
  accompanied her in their canoes for the first thirty miles of her journey.
  She was a practical, hard-headed Christian, with all the fine qualities of
  her ancestors. And she left the Isisi because the work was too easy, and she
  went up into the horrible Ojubi country, electing to live and die in a place
  where white men seldom came. And there she procured an even greater devotion
  from her flock than she had known in the Isisi. She was a great singer of
  hymns, had a beautiful contralto voice, and was famous through the three
  great tribes; and when her health broke down and she decided to return to the
  United States, the people of Ojubi took counsel together, and one morning,
  when she was asleep, her favourite lay preacher, with tears streaming down
  his face, went into her hut and speared her&mdash;so swiftly and so skilfully
  that "only her eyelids fluttered a little."</p>

  <p>Sanders was eighty miles away when he picked up the news from the lokali,
  and he made a forced march through forest and swamp and came up to the Ojubi
  village in the first flush of dawn, when the beautiful little flowers that
  Mama had planted before her hut were a blaze of glory.</p>

  <p>He sat down, a tired, soiled-looking man, and held his palaver.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the slayer, "the Mama was very beautiful to us, and so we
  killed her, that her holy body might stay with us always."</p>

  <p>This was not only the slayer's view, but the view of all the people, even
  of the chief who dominated the village and the district around.</p>

  <p>Sanders was not shocked; he was not angry; he was a little sad at the
  thought of this good life that had been cut short. He hanged the murderer out
  of hand, and the man went to his doom singing a doleful hymn, and approved by
  his fellow-citizens.</p>

  <p>The chief he sent to the village of irons and appointed his successor.
  There were other palavers to be held; poor Mrs. Kleine's effects to be packed
  and dispatched to her home town; and on the last day of his stay Sanders
  called the new chief aside and gave him a few words of counsel.</p>

  <p>"This is a terrible thing which your people have done, chief," he said.
  "More terrible because they think there is no sin in it. And although all the
  world knows that the Ojubi are a silly people, yet they are more foolish than
  men suppose."</p>

  <p>"Lord, there was no folly in sending Mama to the spirits," said the new
  chief astonishingly. "And well we know this, because last night many of our
  young men heard her singing her beautiful songs in the forest. For she told
  us that people did not die, and if people do not die how can they be
  killed?"</p>

  <p>The Commissioner had neither the time nor the desire to argue abstract
  questions of theology. The story of the singing voice he dismissed as an
  inevitable invention, and he went down to the Isisi to break the news to the
  people, and, incidentally, to nip in the bud any plan of reprisal. And it was
  well he did so, for the tidings had already reached the Isisi, and a small
  but select expedition was in course of forming to settle with the Ojubi
  people, though three hundred miles of river and forest separated the two
  tribes.</p>

  <p>There were certain unpleasant plans to deal with the chief of the Ojubi,
  and one of these was to take him out on the Island of Snakes, where the mad
  woman lived.</p>

  <p>Where the great river meets the rushing waters of the Kasava is a little
  pear-shaped island that is called the Place of Snakes. With good reason, for
  certain big snakes live comfortably here, there being many trees where
  vampire bats sleep in clusters by day&mdash;and bats are good eating for the
  long, glistening things that climb trees so slowly that they do not seem to
  move.</p>

  <p>The island had had one inhabitant for many years. Here lived a woman who
  loved snakes and bats and the other strange things that only she understood.
  Lobili was her name, and she was a foreigner, having come to the country in
  the year that Sanders was on his leave.</p>

  <p>She was rich, not in stock and salt or rods, as people in this land are
  rich, but by all accounts in money. There was no reason why Sanders should
  visit her, and many reasons why he should not. The island stood in a place
  where strong currents and cross-eddies made an anchorage difficult. He knew
  she was there, guessed her to be a coast woman who had come back to the land
  of her ancestors for some reason, and was content to have his reports of her
  from neighbouring chiefs and from his spies, who knew most things.</p>

  <p>Amongst others, he learned that she smoked, and that her house was a
  handsome hut erected by Isisi workmen whom she had bribed to venture into
  this dreadful place; and that she paid her taxes to the chief; and that, when
  she raised her hand, certain snakes fell dead. He gave the usual discount to
  this miracle, attributed to all who are credited as graduates in
  witchcraft.</p>

  <p>The day he saw her was the day he met her. From the deck of the Zaire, as
  it swung round in the current, he saw a grey-haired figure standing by the
  edge of the water, holding the end of a fishing line. There was a pipe in her
  mouth and she raised her hand in salute as he passed.</p>

  <p>He was on his way to the Isisi village, which is sited opposite the
  island, to inquire into an irregularity, for Obisi, son of a petty chief, had
  been taken out of the water half dead, with a big lump on his forehead. The
  man was a notorious ne'er-do-well, who hunted when the game came so close
  that he could send his arrows flying from the bed on which he loved to lie,
  and fished when he could squat in a canoe and direct his first wife in her
  spearing. He showed energy only in one pursuit: he was a conscienceless thief
  and had dwelt for a year in the village of irons. Obisi was in bad case now,
  for there was a great swelling on his forehead and a tiny punctured
  wound.</p>

  <p>"Lord, I went to the island&mdash;where the mad woman lives," he wailed,
  "and she came to me and spoke evil words, and when I answered her she put out
  her hand and I felt a terrible pain in my head."</p>

  <p>"At what hour did you go to the island?" asked Sanders, and the man
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Lord, it was in the darkness of the night," he said, "for I was ashamed
  that any of my friends should see me on my way to speak to this mad
  woman."</p>

  <p>Sanders had to deal with primitive people, and be was invariably blunt and
  to the point.</p>

  <p>"You went there to steal!" he accused, and Obisi denied the charge
  mechanically.</p>

  <p>Sanders examined the wound and was puzzled. He naturally discounted
  stories of magic, but here was certainly a mysterious happening that called
  for further inquiry. With some difficulty he landed on the island, and,
  walking warily along the well-trod path, his automatic in his hand (for he
  hated snakes), he came at last to the big hut where the old woman sat&mdash;a
  big, broad-shouldered woman who was neither Isisi nor Akasava.</p>

  <p>She waited patiently, her hands folded in her lap.</p>

  <p>"Lobili, I see you," he said. "Now they tell me a strange word about
  you..."</p>

  <p>He repeated Obisi's story and she listened without a word. When he had
  finished:</p>

  <p>"Lord, this man is worse than a thief," she said. "He came to this island
  last night, and I think that one of the snakes that hang on the trees struck
  him."</p>

  <p>Which was a plausible explanation.</p>

  <p>"Why do you live here all alone, Lobili? You are a woman and there are
  dreadful things on this island."</p>

  <p>"They are not dreadful to me, lord," she said, and made a little whistling
  noise. And then, to Sanders's horror, he saw a flat, spade-shaped head come
  obliquely round the corner of the door, heard the angry hiss and whipped
  round, his pistol extended.</p>

  <p>"Lord, he will not hurt you, for I have taken the poison from him," she
  said, with the ghost of laughter in her brown eyes.</p>

  <p>She made a clicking noise with her lips and the snake vanished.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid of none of these things," she said. "There are worse
  there"&mdash;she pointed to the Isisi bank. "For in a certain place in the
  forest are big snakes that will crush a man to death and kill him with a blow
  of their great heads. And there dwell also men who do evil for the love of
  evil."</p>

  <p>Sanders looked at her sharply, for the rumour had reached him also. He did
  not question her, for she hinted of something about which no native will
  speak.</p>

  <p>He returned to the Zaire and to the village, and made a few inquiries
  about certain strangers in the depth of the forest.</p>

  <p>The Isisi people watched the Zaire apprehensively for the next few days.
  It went aimlessly up and down the river, called at small fishing villages,
  made visits to unfrequented middle islands and to isolated settlements. And
  everywhere he heard the same story. Men had disappeared mysteriously;
  fishermen had gone out in their boats and had not returned; in one case a
  woman had gone into the forest and had vanished.</p>

  <p>He was conscious that not only were the seen villages watching, but unseen
  eyes in the forest followed the Zaire from place to place.</p>

  <p>When at last his ship paddled out of sight down-stream there were many
  relieved hearts in the Isisi.</p>

  <p>Sanders brought the Zaire to the little quay and gave orders that steam
  was to be kept and the boat held ready to leave at a minute's notice, and
  when he met Hamilton he spoke neither of the wounded Obisi nor yet of the
  snake-woman.</p>

  <p>"There is a chopping palaver up in the Isisi," he said, in a tone of
  despair. "And I only hanged D'firo-fusu six months ago!"</p>

  <p>Hamilton whistled. "The swine!" he said softly.</p>

  <p>The Isisi, the N'gombi and part of the Akasava are cannibal people. They
  were always very frank about it. Man was meat, and there was the end of it.
  Also, warriors fought better for the meal that followed victory. Slowly but
  surely, the new law had ground out the practice. Many men had been hanged on
  high trees; many were sent in irons to work for Government; whip and rope had
  changed the habits of the people&mdash;but now and again appeared a wandering
  band of devotees to the old custom, and behind them was a strong business
  end.</p>

  <p>"Bones must go up in the Zaire ostensibly on a marriage palaver
  &mdash;there is one waiting settlement at the Ochori city. He must take as
  few men as possible so as not to frighten the birds. We'll follow on the
  Wiggle with all the men we can spare&mdash;you'll want machine-guns,
  Hamilton, by the way. I think I have located them."</p>

  <p>So Bones went up, and he took his unfinished play with him, and in quiet
  woodings the adventures of the "physic" Harold and the evil Captain Dark were
  developed so eerily that there were times when he leapt up at the sound of a
  breaking twig.</p>

  <p>Navigation was an art which Lieutenant Tibbetts had never thoroughly
  acquired. The river was treacherous, never quite what it seemed on its
  surface, and sandbanks had a habit of coming and going, so that where was a
  deep channel overnight was a boat-trap in the morning.</p>

  <p>Going up was a fairly simple business, for the river ran five knots after
  the rain, and the Zaire made ten knots, which meant that when it was doing
  five knots against the black water he was speeding.</p>

  <p>But this trip of Bones had one exasperating feature which was unusual.
  Every twenty miles along the river was a wooding, where great stacks of
  chores and felled timber awaited the pleasure of Sandi. The men who cut these
  offered their service and were exempt from other taxation. Roughly speaking,
  a week's work once a year was the extent of their labours, for the woodings
  were chosen in rotation, and sometimes the chores were not brought on board
  the Zaire until a year after the billets had been cut.</p>

  <p>And in the first wooding whereat Bones stopped, intending to spend the
  night&mdash;there was no wood. The nearest stock was twenty miles away. Night
  was coming on, and hereabouts navigation is not to be lightly undertaken in
  the dark. Bones sent a Houssa through the darkening forest and summoned
  before him the chief of the little village whose task it was to supply the
  labour.</p>

  <p>This man was very glib. "Lord," he said, "Sandi himself took our wood two
  moons and one ago, and because my young men have been sick and very weak we
  have not cut down the trees&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bones cut his explanation short. On the Zaire was a little book in which
  was kept a very accurate record of the woodings visited, and this was known
  as "57," and the Zaire had not tied up to the steep banks of the forest for
  nearly eighteen months.</p>

  <p>"You're a naughty old story-teller," said Bones, annoyed, and then, in
  Bomongo: "You shall cut and pile twice the wood I require before my return,
  Kibili. Also, I will draw taxation from you&mdash;so many strings of fish and
  so much salt. Have this when I return."</p>

  <p>The chief was a little terrified, crossed his arms over his thin chest and
  clasped his sides, a gesture of supreme unhappiness.</p>

  <p>"Lord, the fish you may have and the salt also, but the wood I cannot give
  you, because my young men are sick, and, lord, we are terribly frightened
  because of the great spirits which dwell hereabouts, as your lordship
  knows."</p>

  <p>"O fool!" said the aggravated young man. "What spirits are there in the
  world?"</p>

  <p>At that moment there flashed into his mind the memory of his "physic"
  hero, and a ghost half-raised (on paper) in his cabin.</p>

  <p>"There are many spirits here. Tibbetti," said the chief in a hushed voice,
  "and because of them my young men are afraid to come into this part of the
  wood. For here is heard the voice of the singing mama."</p>

  <p>"Singing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bones had known the singing mama, and a cold chill crept down his spine.
  The little chief saw his advantage and followed it up.</p>

  <p>"Often we have heard her beautiful songs as she walks through the dark
  woods," he said; "and sometimes we fear for her because of the
  Killers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He had betrayed himself: the young officer saw him squirm in an ecstasy of
  fear.</p>

  <p>Now, Bones in his leisure and private moments was quite different from the
  Bones on duty. His blue eyes narrowed until they seemed closed. He had
  reached the jumping-off place where he left behind all that was not deadly
  earnest.</p>

  <p>"Speak, man," he said softly, "and tell me of these Killers who live in
  the forest and chop men."</p>

  <p>Now he knew why there was no wood to carry him to the next post: fear of
  the Killers, who pick off solitary workmen and prey on the little bands of
  woodmen.</p>

  <p>"O, ko! I have talked too much!" gasped the chief, his face a mottled
  grey. "Let me talk with my people, lord."</p>

  <p>Bones nodded. He went back to the boat and flew a pigeon to Sanders, then
  called Ali Mahmet, the corporal of his six soldiers.</p>

  <p>"Two men will stay on the puc-a-puc and stand by the hawsers. Yoka the
  engineer and his man shall keep steam ready. You and your four men will come
  ashore with fifty rounds and go where I go."</p>

  <p>Then he went on the land and the chief was waiting to speak with him.</p>

  <p>"This is the truth, Tibbetti," he said. "The Killers live in the forest
  half a night's journey away. There are two hands of them"&mdash;he held up
  two hands with the fingers extended. "Now I think with your fine soldiers you
  may catch them, for it is true that we are afraid. And once before, when the
  Killers came here, in the days of my father, they took my own brother away
  with them..."</p>

  <p>Bones listened to the tragic history with great patience.</p>

  <p>"You shall walk before me, chief," he said, "and if you are a Killer man
  and lead me and my fine soldiers into danger, you shall walk in hell this
  night."</p>

  <p>There was a very definite path through the forest, it appeared, and Bones
  remembered that once he had followed the first part of it in quest of a
  certain white weakling who had broken the laws. He spent the rest of the day
  coaching his men, anxiously awaiting news from Sanders. If he lost this
  opportunity he might miss his quarry altogether.</p>

  <p>He waited until the night came, a cool night of stars, and fell in his
  little party. Kibili, the chief, led the way, and behind him came Bones. They
  marched in silence for an hour, and then the man called a halt. From time to
  time as they walked. Bones slipped his compass from his pocket and examined
  the illuminated dial. It is next to impossible to get an exact compass
  bearing on the march, but he saw enough to realise that they had diverged
  from the northern track and were walking in a half-circle eastwards. So far
  from entering the forest, they were keeping an almost parallel course with
  the river. When they halted he confirmed this. They were now moving towards
  the Isisi city. He put the compass back in his pocket, and, taking out his
  automatic, kept his thumb on the safety-catch.</p>

  <p>For a minute he considered the advisability of returning to the Zaire. But
  if the agreed plan was in operation, Sanders, who was, only ten hours behind
  him, would be near the wooding by now. If he were tied up at a lower depot he
  would certainly send a runner through the forest in search of news.</p>

  <p>The wood was very silent and still, and Bones, in a brief moment, thought
  of ghosts and shivered.</p>

  <p>"March," he said in a low tone, and the little column went on.</p>

  <p>Again they stopped at the end of an hour. They were moving inland, but
  still they were within easy reach of the river. The Zaire could have kept
  pace with them if he had only understood the direction of the chase. For the
  moment his suspicion of the guide was mechanical rather than acute. The man
  might be following the safer path to the lair of the Red Men.</p>

  <p>Another two hours brought them to rising ground.</p>

  <p>"Lord, on the other side of this is the Place of the Red Men," whispered
  the guide. He was reeking with perspiration, which was partly due to
  fear.</p>

  <p>Bones called Ali Mahmet to him.</p>

  <p>"Let the men fix their little swords," he said in a low voice. "There must
  be no shooting till I speak."</p>

  <p>The bayonets had been blacked in the smoke of an oil wick before they left
  the boat. He heard the click-click as they slipped into their sockets... when
  he turned again to the guide he had vanished. As silent as the forest about
  them, he had gone from view.</p>

  <p>Bones thumbed down the safety-catch of his pistol and grinned mirthlessly
  into the night.</p>

  <p>"Shoulder to shoulder in a circle, Ahmet Ali!" he said, and felt his way
  to the nearest man.</p>

  <p>At that instant he heard a guttural Arabic oath and the "flug" of a
  bayonet striking home, and simultaneously somebody caught him by the ankles
  and he went down to earth with a crash that knocked the breath out of him.
  Twice he fired at the body that fell upon him, and felt the convulsive wiggle
  that followed, and then something struck him on the side of the head and he
  went silly.</p>

  <p>He was standing when he came to his senses, and he could feel the warm wet
  blood that was rolling leisurely from his cheek. Somebody held him; his gun
  was gone, and he heard a man sobbing with pain near his feet.</p>

  <p>"Let us take them to the Killing Place," said a voice, and then another
  called Kibili by name, only they used the N'gombi equivalent, which is
  "N'osobu."</p>

  <p>"He is dead," said a third voice. "Tibbetti chopped him with the little
  gun that says 'ha ha!'"</p>

  <p>The first speaker grunted something and the party moved on. Bones listened
  to the footfalls and presently distinguished them all. His men were still
  alive; he heaved a sigh of thankfulness and, appreciating the small cause
  there was for relief, grinned again. His hands were tied native fashion,
  which meant that they were fastened so tightly that presently his hands would
  begin to swell. If he could persuade them to let his hands go free there was
  a small Browning in the inside pocket of his shirt.</p>

  <p>"O man!" he called. "Why do you tie me, for you have my little gun that
  says 'ha ha!' and you are many."</p>

  <p>"A tied man does not cut his hands," was the ominous answer&mdash;the old
  cannibal slogan.</p>

  <p>He tried to reach his shirt-pocket, but the rough native rope that held
  him was passed under his legs and knotted to his elbows behind.</p>

  <p>Crossing a ridge. Bones had a momentary glimpse of the river, and far away
  the twinkling light of a fire.</p>

  <p>"Tibbetti, this night you die," said a voice. "There was a little dog who
  followed a leopard into the wood, and all the time the leopard followed
  him."</p>

  <p>Silence followed, and then unexpectedly the unknown leader called a
  halt.</p>

  <p>"I hear," he said, and they stood listening... a sharp steel point touched
  Bones's throat.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing&mdash;"Almost as he spoke, the voice came from the
  wood&mdash;the voice of a woman singing.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"While shepherds watched their flocks by night,<br>
  All seated on the ground,<br>
  The angel of the Lord came down,<br>
  And glory shone around."</p><br>

  <p>Clear as a bell, yet soft and unspeakably sweet the voice sounded. It was
  near them.</p>

  <p>Bones went cold: he had never heard the voice of Mama Kleine, but this was
  an American...</p>

  <p>"O, ko! what is that?" asked a hoarse voice.</p>

  <p>"It is the spirit of Mama-Jesu," came an answer. They waited, but there
  was no other sound but the thud of hearts beating fiercely.</p>

  <p>"We are there," said somebody. "Let us light the fire." Bones heard the
  sound of wet leaves being brushed aside, and a dull glowing circle appeared
  on the earth. An armful of dry brushwood was thrown on the hidden fire,
  smoked fragrantly for a moment, and then burst into flames.</p>

  <p>And now Bones saw&mdash;not ten, but forty of the Red Men, mainly N'gombi.
  One who seemed to be in some position of authority had a great bump on his
  forehead, and him the other addressed as Obisi.</p>

  <p>Bones looked round for the survivors of his party and found them more or
  less intact, and wondered why they had been spared. It was Obisi who supplied
  the answer, as though he had interpreted the questioning glance.</p>

  <p>"The live goat walks," he said, "but the dead goat we must carry."</p>

  <p>"Sellin' us on the hoof," said Bones in English, and was hysterically
  pleased with his ghastly jest.</p>

  <p>"You, Tibbetti, we will kill because you are white and nobody would buy
  you," said Obisi.</p>

  <p>He took from the hands of one of the men a sickle-shaped weapon, broad in
  the blade and crudely engraved.</p>

  <p>"This&mdash;"he said, and then he fell down.</p>

  <p>Bones heard the ping! and the smack of the thing that struck him, but he
  was unprepared for the collapse of his executioner. A man yelled in fright
  and ran to the prostrate Obisi and turned him on his back.</p>

  <p>"This is magic!" he yelled, and his hand was fumbling for the sickle knife
  when:</p>

  <p>Ping!</p>

  <p>The man dropped on his knees, his hand at his side, grimacing
  horribly.</p>

  <p>From somewhere along the forest path came the sound of shots, and
  presently three naked forms flew into the light of the fire and screamed
  something over their shoulders. Bones heard the words and almost swooned.</p>

  <p>"Speak well for me, Tibbetti," gasped a man, and hacked in two the rope
  that bound him&mdash;and he was a lucky man. The bullet that whistled past
  just missed him as he ducked his head to cut the last strands.</p>

  <p>"All right, sir!" yelled Bones, as Sanders's pistol was raised.</p>

  <p>"Thank the good Lord&mdash;"began Sanders. Then came the eerie
  interruption. From the shadows of the wood came the voice of the sweet
  singer:</p>

  <p>"Now thank we all our God..."</p>

  <p>Sanders stared into the shadows.</p>

  <p>"For the love of heaven!" he gasped, and then came the most astonishing
  incident of that night.</p>

  <p>Into view, walking very slowly, came the grey-haired snake-woman.</p>

  <p>"O Lobili&mdash;"began Sanders, and she laughed, a low, chuckling laugh of
  delight.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I'm not called Lobili," she said, and Sanders could have
  dropped, for this handsome old negress spoke English. "I'm Dr. Selina Grant,
  of Gregorytown University, Curator and Lecturer on Biology. We simply had to
  get somebody in this country, Mr. Sanders. My colour helped a lot, I guess,
  but it required a great deal of heart-searching before a woman of my age
  consented to assume the scanty attire of the indigenous native."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" said Sanders hollowly, and pinched himself to make sure that
  he was awake. "You're&mdash;you're a negress?"</p>

  <p>She nodded laughingly.</p>

  <p>"Sure; that's how the Lord made me. My father was a doctor in Charlestown
  and my mother was pure Bantu. Bomongo I learnt in six months from a
  missionary who was on leave back home. I guess it came natural. It was kind
  of lonely&mdash;I've been here three years&mdash;and if I hadn't wandered
  around singing, I'd have forgotten what the American language sounded like!
  And, Mr. Sanders, I've got the dandiest lot of unclassified Ophidia you could
  wish to see&mdash;you must come to my island and inspect my viporum..."</p>

  <p>Sanders took off his helmet and held out his hand. "Shake, doctor," he
  said; and Dr. Selina Grant stuck the air-pistol into her belt and gripped his
  hand in her big palm.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, dear old ma'am." Bones found his voice. "It was you
  singin'?"</p>

  <p>"Sure!" said Selina.</p>

  <p>"An' your jolly old air-gun&mdash;?</p>

  <p>"Air-pistol&mdash;it's the only weapon I've had, but it's mighty
  useful."</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, ma'am," said Bones, agitated.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet none of you boys has got the makings?" she asked. "This
  pipe-smoking's too primitive for Selina."</p>

  <p>Bones found her a cigarette and lit it for her. "You're the first native
  lady I've done that for," he said. It was indeed the most novel experience of
  his life.</p>
