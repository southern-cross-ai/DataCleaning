<br>


<p>"Lunch in London, the day after tomorrow...'</p>

<p>The skipper dropped the words out of one corner of his mouth without
disturbing the cigarette in the other corner. He disposed of some three
thousand miles of atmosphere as nonchalantly as you would toss a peanut
shell over your shoulder.</p>

<p>I blinked. But only once. After all, the past two days had been so
fantastic that this ultimate scene and conversation on the brilliantly
lighted airfield outside a city in one of the Southern states, beside
the big airliner which was to take me to England in a scheduled
thirty-six hours, seemed part and parcel of the events that had been
happening thick and fast ever since the telephone woke me at seven
o'clock one morning.</p>

<p>The telephone had summoned me from a dream in which Richard and I
were running, hand in hand, down our own narrow strip of Cape Cod beach
into the ocean. Sleepily, unwilling to let go of that dream, I reached
for the receiver and held it to my ear. New York calling. At Dennis,
Cape Cod, at seven o'clock of a May morning, New York seems as far away
as London or Timbuktu.</p>

<p>"Are you up?" the voice of my lawyer demanded crisply.</p>

<p>Knowing me as she does, this was purely a rhetorical question which,
I felt, did not rate an answer. She went on: "Get up! Right away! Get
yourself onto the first plane, or the first train, into New York. I've
just had word from the Air Ministry in Washington that there is space
for you on the British Airways plane leaving at midnight tomorrow.
You're on your way."</p>

<p>After weeks of more or less patient waiting, repeated timid,
pleading, urgent, and finally importunate requests to the authorities
who rule such matters in Washington and London, and a rapid-fire
barrage of telegrams, cables, and telephone calls, it had happened. At
last I had permission to do what I had been wanting desperately to do
for four years&mdash;go to England and do my bit on a tour for E.N.S.A.
Though no one knew just when, everyone was aware that the invasion of
Europe was imminent. More than anything in the world I wanted the
opportunity to entertain the British and American troops who would soon
be fighting in France.</p>

<p>Basil Dean, founder and director of E.N.S.A.&mdash;the British
equivalent of the U.S.O.&mdash;had cabled, asking me to come; but
getting a priority to make the crossing and getting a place aboard a
plane had taken a lot of wire-pulling at the American end. Now, I was
really on my way home to London which I had not seen in six years. I
would see my old friends, or at least those who remained of that gay
company after the Battle of Britain&mdash;those who weren't fighting in
Italy or the Near and Far East, or on any one of the seven seas.</p>

<p>And I might see Richard.</p>

<p>That thought brought me out of bed and under the shower in one swift
leap. From then on the next two days were one mad rush, winding up with
the final leap to the airport.</p>

<p>And now here I was, ready to board the big airliner for the hop to
Newfoundland. I caught my breath, and did my best to imitate the
casual-almost-to-the-point-of-boredom air shown by all members of all
the air forces I have ever met when they are about to take off.</p>

<p>I was assured of passage to Newfoundland, where we were due to land
at 9:00 A.M. the next day. Whether there would be a place for me in the
plane going on from there to Ireland remained disturbingly uncertain.
We all joked about it, standing there beside the plane. The others were
sure of their passage all the way to England. They were officials or
had diplomatic passports and were bursting with priorities. But I had
only a number-three priority, which guaranteed me nothing much more
than leave to hitch-hike.</p>

<p>Ernest Hemingway was among the favored ones. I met him then for the
first time. There is something about Mr. Hemingway that makes one think
of a small boy&mdash;a rather mischievous small boy whose pockets are
full of bits of string, old rusty nails, chewing gum, and maybe a pet
toad or two. A small boy hiding behind a big, bushy beard. He asked me,
grinning:</p>

<p>"Suppose there is no place for you on the plane? What will you
do?"</p>

<p>"Stow away," I retorted, "in your beard!"</p>

<p>This, I found, was Hemingway's first visit to England. How strange
and sad, too, to have one's first glimpse of London in her grim battle
dress.</p>

<p>My first view of Newfoundland, from about five thousand feet, was of
an enormous black-and-brown land splashed with snow, like a huge
chocolate cake with white icing. All around was a calm, oily, gray sea
and, overhead, a beautiful clear, cloudless sky. We had breakfast in
the cabin of the plane before we docked. Then we went out to breathe
the fresh, salty, fishy-smelling air, stretch our legs, and see the
sights. The airport was full of Canadian, British, and American airmen
from the planes which ferry steadily back and forth across the North
Atlantic. You felt you were getting close to the fighting front, even
though several thousand miles of ocean still stretched between
Newfoundland and Europe. Here, everyone was engaged, in one way or
another, in getting on with the war. The little town was crowded.
People spoke matter-of-factly about hopping from continent to
continent.</p>

<p>Recalling letters from England and tales of food shortages over
there, I did some prudent shopping and emerged triumphantly with a
watch, which I had forgotten to get in New York, two pounds of butter,
and a dozen eggs. I tried to buy some lemons, which I knew were
regarded in England as extinct, but they were extinct that day in
Newfoundland also.</p>

<p>The local paper announced that the Germans were retreating in Italy.
Good! The invasion of Europe was believed to be very near now. And it
was reported that Roosevelt would run again. I wished my chances of
holding my seat (in the plane) were as good as his.</p>

<p>After lunch and the arrival of the Pan-American Clipper, bringing
more passengers bound for England, I was assured there was a place for
me on the plane leaving at one-fifteen. I told Ernest Hemingway:</p>

<p>"Your beard is now safe from British invasion."</p>

<p>For the next eighteen hours, during eight of which I slept soundly,
we flew so high, sometimes at an altitude of eight thousand feet, that
there was nothing to see but clouds. How strange was the knowledge that
far below was the stretch of tossing gray ocean I had crossed so many
times since my first trip to America in 1924, when I came over with the
cast of <i>Charlot's Revue</i>. Strange to think that, far below us,
the American and British navies were patrolling those same waters to
protect the convoys of transports and freighters which were plying back
and forth with men and war mat&Atilde;&copy;riel.</p>

<p>Just after daylight we had our first glimpse of Ireland&mdash;lush
green fields and the heather-colored mountains of Connemara with the
morning mists curling from their crests like ostrich feathers.
Disturbingly peaceful it seemed after the warlike atmosphere one felt
in Newfoundland. Fat white sheep grazed placidly in the fields that
bordered the road by which we motored from Limerick. Several times our
car slowed down to clear the road for the herds of young beef cattle,
bound (as I hoped) eventually for England. Every letter I had had from
friends at home had spoken wistfully of the past days of plenty. Though
none of the writers complained, you read between the lines the same
longing you see in children's faces pressed against a sweetshop
window.</p>

<p>We took off again late that afternoon and put down at Croydon about
seven o'clock. The skipper, who had promised me lunch in London that
day, was only five hours out on his calculation.</p>

<p>Flying across southern England, I wondered where Richard was and how
soon I might see him. After all, I couldn't expect the American Navy to
adjust its plans to allow one of its lieutenant commanders to be at
Croydon to meet his wife. But, being a woman, I couldn't help
wishing.</p>

<p>In the excitement of actually recognizing the big, familiar field
just below us, I bounced in my seat&mdash;and promptly broke two of the
precious eggs in my lap.</p>

<p>"My God, woman," said Hemingway, helping me clean up the mess, "what
are you going to do <i>now?</i>"</p>

<p>"Fortunately, I'm the same shape front and back," I told him. I
jerked my tweed skirt around so that the egg stain was behind me,
buttoned my fur coat, and assured myself, as I tripped down the
gangplank, that I was making as neat an entrance as any in my
career.</p>

<p>It was eight o'clock, the dinner hour, when I drove up to the dear
familiar Savoy. It was not yet dark, just the beloved twilight, yet
London's streets were strangely quiet and free of traffic. There were
great gaps in the familiar skyline and piles of rubble along the
streets we drove through. All the way over I had been steeling myself
for this, my first view of bombed London. I knew it was going to be
hard to take. There was bound to be that wrenching struggle between the
impulse to cry out and the feeling that one simply dared not give way
to one's feelings. London is my home town. I was born there in
Kennington Oval. I grew up within the sound of Bow Bells. I spoke with
a cockney accent until I was eleven or thereabouts, when Miss Italia
Conti scolded and drilled me out of it. In London I have been by turns
poor and rich, hopeful and despondent, successful and down and out,
utterly miserable and ecstatically, dizzily happy. I belong to London
as each of us can belong to only one place on this earth. And, in the
same way, London belongs to me.</p>

<p>The windows of my room at the Savoy looked out over the Thames
Embankment. After a solitary dinner, as I stood there looking down, I
had my first sharp realization of what war had done to my town. An
impenetrable black curtain seemed to have fallen between me and the
city. The enveloping blackness in which the stars seemed unreally
bright and near and the unusual, wary, listening stillness were more
impressive at that moment than the destruction wrought by the bombs.
They filled me with a swift, blinding fury against the enemy who could
muffle the voice and force of the greatest and most tolerant city in
the world. Suddenly the silence overhead was cut by the whir of flying
planes. They were our bombers starting out for targets across the
Channel. The sound carried me back to World War I, when we used to be
glad of nights such as this, when there was no moon to guide the
Zeppelins up the winding Thames to drop their death freight on us.</p>

<p>On such a night...</p>

<p>Suddenly, as against a black-velvet backdrop, the past came back to
me, and I saw myself as a little girl, dancing on a sidewalk in
Clapham....</p>

<br>


<p>Clapham is not the least desirable of London's many widely sprawled
districts. Clapham is "genteel." Dwellers in other suburban districts
of London speak enviously of their better-off cousins and in-laws who
are privileged to live in Clapham, London S.W. For them&mdash;and they
include thousands of tried-and-true Londoners&mdash;Clapham is
something to aspire to.</p>

<p>Residents of Clapham speak of these less-favored boroughs with no
more than the faintest tinge of superiority. For if there is one thing
which every true Claphamite knows and will swear to, it is that
employment is full of uncertainties and life is a matter of ups and
downs. His attitude toward the dwellers in the East End is that of the
humble apostle; but for the grace of God, there go I.</p>

<p>Clapham has its own code, its own proper pride, and its own firmly
rooted conventions. For one thing, it is very bad form, indeed, to ask
questions. Of course you can't help being aware of certain facts about
your neighbors: the hours they keep, who is in or out of work, whose
husband spends more of his free time at the corner pub than he spends
with his family, and what they buy at the butcher's and greengrocer's.
Good form, however, demands a pretense that you know none of these
things. If one of your neighbors suddenly disappears overnight, bag and
baggage, you are properly surprised about it the next morning, even
though you did hear the bailiff's voice in the hall and the stamping
made by the men from the hire-purchase company as they carried out the
furniture.</p>

<p>If you were brought up in Clapham, as I was, you don't have to be
informed of these nice points of etiquette. You grow up knowing them.
"Don't be nosy," Mother would say. And Dad would add: "It doesn't pay
to see everything, my girl."</p>

<p>Mother hadn't always lived in Clapham, and Kennington Oval was a
step down for her. Her father had been a master builder&mdash;a man of
substance in his own line, whose fortune, however, had been lost in
"gilt-edged" securities. Granny still lived in the same house to which
she had moved as a young bride, where her children were born, and
where, she stoutly affirmed, she intended, "God willing, my dear," to
die. Mother had taken the step down when she allowed the unexplained
romantic streak in her nature to make her deaf to the dictates of her
class. Following that will-o'-the-wisp, she married for love with a
blind disregard for economic security&mdash;married, of all things, a
theatrical! And a foreigner at that. Even though he had come to England
at the age of two, he was a Dane whose professional name was Arthur
Lawrence. He sang in a deep, rich basso profundo, and with a dramatic
fervor that went down very well with audiences at smoking concerts and
in the smaller music halls. He rendered such favorites as "Old Black
Joe" and "Asleep in the Deep." His "Drinking Song" was famous
throughout Brixton and Shepherd's Bush. Alas!</p>

<p>Mother had been very carefully brought up. "All the time your father
courted me we never once were out together after ten o'clock. I'm sure
I don't know what your grandfather would have said if I had not been
home and on my way to bed when the clock struck that hour."</p>

<p>So much decorum must have been a great strain on my father,
accustomed as he was to the hours kept by the profession. Perhaps
something in his Danish nature responded to this strict middle-class
propriety. His family, the Klasens, were a solid, respectable
lot&mdash;and he was the only one of them with a taste for anything so
Bohemian as the stage.</p>

<p>Mother's family shook their heads over the future of such a
marriage, and they were quite right about it. My father liked his
glass, and an evening dedicated to bass solos gives a man a thirst. He
was&mdash;as I was to learn&mdash;one of those whose personality was
completely altered by alcohol. His gaiety, his charm, his blond good
looks disappeared. He became ugly in disposition and demeanor. Mother
left him soon after I was born. I grew up with no memories and no
knowledge of him. But I adored Dad, my stepfather.</p>

<p>No wonder Granny shook her head over Mother, who just couldn't seem
to learn about men. Mother chose her two husbands for their charm, not
for their ability to provide. Father had always been able to sing for
our supper, but Dad was always promising to provide handsomely. "Wait,"
he would say to us. "Just let me back a winner...." When he did, we
would celebrate with a slap-up feast&mdash;boiled salmon, or a bird,
toasted cheese, and a side dish of prawns. And, occasionally,
asparagus. The first time we had this delicacy, I remember, Mother cut
off all the green tips and boiled the white stalks.</p>

<p>Gertrude Alexandra Dagmar Lawrence Klasen&mdash;little Gertie
Lawrence to you&mdash;was quite satisfied with Kennington Oval. For one
thing, the organ-grinder came there frequently and would pause and
grind out a tune on each side of the Oval, which gave the residents a
fair-sized concert. I never could resist him, nor could I learn to be a
proper child and satisfy myself with opening the window a crack to let
the music come into the room.</p>

<p>"Where is that child?" Mother would ask. One look from the window
was enough. There I was, following the music, holding out my brief
skirts and dancing to what I hoped was the admiration of the
neighbors.</p>

<p>Nobody that I know of had taught me to dance. The steps just seemed
to come to me the minute my ears caught the music. But Mother loved
"musical evenings," and my first song, learned from a sheet of free
music cut from a newspaper, went like this:</p>

<blockquote><i>Oh, it ain't all honey, and it ain't all jam,</i><br>
<i>Walking round the 'ouses with a three-wheel pram,</i><br>
<i>All on me lonesome, not a bit to eat,</i><br>
<i>Walking about on me poor old feet.</i><br>
<i>My old man, if I could find 'im,</i><br>
<i>A lesson I would give.</i><br>
<i>Poor old me, I 'aven't got a key,</i><br>
<i>And I don't know where I live.</i><br>
Boom! Boom!</blockquote>

<p>Whenever we had company, on a Sunday night, I would be made to
oblige with a song. "Gertie's such a funny one!" Dad would puff out his
chest, proud of my accomplishment.</p>

<p>"Fancy! A child her age singing songs like that!"</p>

<p>"Whatever will she do next? She ought to go on the stage. She's got
it in her."</p>

<p>That song brought me the first money I ever earned. The summer I was
six Dad must have had a streak of unusual good luck with the horses
because he took Mother and me to Bognor Regis for the bank holiday. It
was boiling hot, I remember, and the sands were crowded. I had never
been to the sea before; the bathers, the picnic parties on the sand,
the strollers along the Front fascinated me. A concert party was
entertaining, and Dad paid for us to go in. At the close of the regular
bill the "funny man" came forward and invited anyone in the audience
who cared to, to come up on the stage and entertain the crowd. A push
from Mother and the command: "Go on now, Gertie, and sing your song,"
was all the urging I needed. "<i>It ain't all honey, and it ain't all
jam,</i>" I caroled lightly, twirling on my toes with my skimpy pink
frock held out as far as it would stretch. The applause and the cheers
were gratifying, even without the large golden sovereign which the
manager presented to me after a little speech.</p>

<p>I know I must have told this story to Noel Coward. No doubt I
boasted of it when we were both pupils at Miss Conti's dancing school.
The incident may have given him the idea for one of the scenes in
<i>Cavalcade</i>. In fact, when I saw the play, there was something so
familiar about that little girl doing her song and dance on the
Brighton sands, the little girl who grew up to be an actress, that I
felt a rush of tears and a choke in my throat. She made me remember,
suddenly, so many things I thought I had forgotten.</p>

<p>One other thing makes that holiday at Bognor Regis stand out in my
mind. We were living in lodgings, of course. Late one Sunday afternoon
Mother told Dad to take me for a walk along the Front while she got our
supper ready. Dad and I walked about for a bit, enjoying the crowds;
then I noticed that his steps began to drag and he began to cast
longing eyes at the saloon doors from which, now that they were open
again, came the cool, sour smell of beer. Finally, he could stand it no
longer.</p>

<p>"Sit down on that bench, Gertie," he said. "You can have a nice look
at the sea and the people going by. Be a good girl, now, and don't move
until I come back for you."</p>

<p>I watched him disappear in the direction of the nearest bar. I was
not disconcerted. Obediently I sat on the bench, swinging my legs and
enjoying my freedom. Even more than the sea and the crowd, I was
interested in a stand where a sign announced bicycles for hire. That
drew me as inevitably as the saloon had drawn Dad.</p>

<p>"How much does it cost to hire a bike?" I asked the attendant</p>

<p>"Sixpence an hour, my dear."</p>

<p>I felt around in my coat pocket and produced the coin. The attendant
looked at me a bit doubtfully, but the sixpence was real enough and
there in the rack was a bike just my size. He took it out and lifted me
up on the saddle.</p>

<p>"That will do you a fair treat," he said. "Now be sure you bring it
back in an hour." He turned away to wait on another customer.</p>

<p>I wheeled the machine proudly across the Front and down a street
into a crescent where the railings in front of the houses gave me
something to hold onto. I had never been on a cycle before, but I had
no doubt of my ability to ride one. I leaned it against the railing,
paying no attention to the sign which read, "Fresh Paint," mounted it,
and, holding onto the railing with one hand, managed to pedal around
the crescent. It was thrilling, like riding a circus horse around the
ring, and there was always the possibility that the people were
watching me from the windows of the houses. I fell off several times,
skinned my knee, and got the front of my frock grubby while the side
toward the railings became ornamented with stripes of green paint, but
I kept at it, getting better with each lap. I had forgotten Dad and
Mother, even the admonition of the attendant at the bicycle stand to be
back within an hour.</p>

<p>It was getting dusk before Dad found me, a frantic, red-faced,
frightened Dad, who had already spent some time running up and down the
Front calling, "Gertie! Gertie!" and demanding of everyone, "Have you
seen my little girl anywhere about?"</p>

<p>His relief at sight of me was immediately transformed into anger for
the fright I had caused him. "Now, then, whatever have you been up to?
You'd ought to be ashamed of yourself running off like that! Such a
fright you've given me! Whatever would I have said to your mother? She
won't half give you a piece of her mind when she sees what you've done
to your frock! And it's your poor dad will get the worst of it."</p>

<p>He went on, muttering and scolding, all the way back to the bicycle
stand where he paid the attendant for the over-time. And still
clutching me by the hand, as though afraid I would vanish again, he
hurried me back to our lodgings. We were nearly there when he stopped,
removed his hat, and wiped his brow. Giving me a long look that
immediately established a confidence between us, he remarked
tentatively, "I don't know. How would it be if we were to take your
mother a little gin and bitters to have with her supper?"</p>

<p>I nodded approval.</p>

<p>"Wait here, then. And none of your vanishing acts, my girl!"</p>

<p>He stepped jauntily into the convenient door of a refreshment bar.
After a few minutes he emerged, wiping his mustache and looking very
much more like himself. He patted one bulging pocket: "Your mother
always did fancy a gin and bitters. Your mother's a wonderful woman,
Gertie. Don't you ever forget it!"</p>

<p>No, I promised myself. Somehow or other I felt that I now had two
allies against Mother's anger when she discovered the state of my
dress. Dad, I felt, would be on my side and could be counted on to
bring up the reinforcements&mdash;namely the gin and bitters&mdash;at
the psychological moment.</p>

<p>Dad's admiration for Mother was unbounded, and his devotion was as
great as his admiration. Whenever they had a tiff, he would feel moved
to tell me solemnly that it was all his fault. He appreciated Mother's
fine qualities, and he would lecture me on the subject of showing the
same appreciation.</p>

<p>"Mind you always do as your mother tells you to, my girl. Your
mother's a wonderful woman. Just you try to be like her, and you won't
go far wrong."</p>

<p>There was nothing sentimental about Mother, nor about her
determination to bring me up according to her standards. She saw to it
that I came straight home from school each day and that I did the
household tasks that were assigned to me. One of these was blacking the
fire grates. As Mother said, there was something about a well-blacked
grate that gave a room an air. It may be that this helped her morale
and compensated for some of the instability of her life with Dad. Each
of us has some sort of pet fetish, something we cling to which gives us
self-confidence and power to go on. A neat, well-blacked fireplace was
Mother's. If she had blacked the grates herself, she would have missed
the satisfaction of feeling that she was bringing up her daughter in
the proper tradition. So I blacked the grates each day. And on
Saturdays I did the brass and helped in general.</p>

<p>It was not sentimentality but a fierce pride for herself and for Dad
that made Mother put me into ruffled frocks which were a bother to make
and to wash and iron. And what a nuisance they were for me to keep
clean! It seemed as though some mischievous fate led me into trouble as
soon as I was sent out, freshly bathed and dressed, with strict orders
to "walk around the pond and try to act like a lady." It wasn't that I
deliberately tried to misbehave, but that life would not let me follow
Mother's command. It would hold out some other inducement to me,
something I could not refuse. Before I knew it I would be engaged in
sailing boats on the pond, getting wetter and muddier every minute, or
making friends with some stray mongrel puppy whose playful paws had no
regard for my starched ruffles.</p>

<p>"Why can't you be like your cousin Ruby!" Mother would scold.</p>

<p>My cousin was all that I was not&mdash;she was a plump, pretty, neat
child with curls hanging to her waist; my hair was lank and as straight
as a die. My cousin Ruby was always spotless and without a wrinkle. Her
nails were clean. She was the pride of the family, and she knew it. Her
father, my mother's brother, was in charge of the Royal Stables at
Buckingham Palace, which gave Ruby a prestige. "Just look at your
cousin," Mother would say. "She is such a credit to her parents, it's a
pleasure to watch her come into a room. Here I spend hours on making
you look nice and it lasts until you're out of sight. I declare,
Gertie, you've got the very devil in you."</p>

<br>


<p>I think Mother always regretted losing the world in which she had
lived briefly with my father&mdash;the world of the theater. In a
slightly discolored mother-of-pearl card case she treasured a number of
visiting cards of actresses she had known in those days. Sometimes, as
a treat, she would let me play with them. I would pull a card out of
the case, read the name aloud, and she would immediately launch into
the story of how she and the owner of the card met and where, what her
specialty was, and Mother's own opinion of how good she was at it. This
parlor game gave me my first inside information on the theatrical
profession. One of the things I learned was that Friday was
"professional night" at most of the theaters. On Friday night it was
usual to admit members of the profession free. By the time I was eight
or nine, I had learned the trick of writing neatly across the face of
any one of the cards, "Please give my little girl two seats." If Mother
was out that evening, I would take the card, call for one of my little
girl friends, and together we would take the tram to Brixton or any
near-by district where there was a theater. I would present myself and
my card at the box office. The man would look through the wicket at me
a little doubtfully, whereupon I would put on my most innocent and
pleading look. Usually someone hanging about would say: "Oh, give the
kids a couple of seats." We would skip in and find places in the
gallery.</p>

<p>After the show we would take the tram home, hoping desperately to
get there before our mothers found us out. Once, I remember, either the
tram was delayed or Mother came home from Granny's earlier than usual.
She found the other little girl's mother hammering at our door.</p>

<p>"Your Gertie came and took my Mabel!" she cried.</p>

<p>"They're not back yet."</p>

<p>Mother did not put off whipping me to ask too many questions. After
the punishment, she began to inquire into our evening. What shocked her
most of all was our riding to and from Brixton on the tram.</p>

<p>"Did you speak to anyone?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"A gentleman spoke to me."</p>

<p>"How do you know he was a gentleman?" Mother asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Because he was wearing a gold watch and chain!"</p>

<p>Strangely, this seemed to satisfy her as completely as it had
satisfied me.</p>

<p>The rooms on Kennington Oval marked the high tide of our finances.
We lived there only as long as luck was with Dad. Then we moved, as we
frequently did. There was a regular ritual connected with these movings
which varied only as we moved up or down in the economic scale. If the
move was occasioned by good fortune, Mother added a piano to the
furniture she ordered sent around to the new address. There was
something undeniably genteel about a piano in the house, even if no one
could play it.</p>

<p>If the move was in the other direction, a van drove up and men
smelling of sawdust and beer carried away the piano and the rest of the
furniture which we had on the hire-purchase plan. They were quite
impersonal about it; they gave you to understand that their orders to
take away the tables and chairs and the sideboard with the mirror at
the back came from the company. Mother was always on her dignity with
them. She refused to be commiserated with. In her own way she contrived
to imply a disdain for the household chattels over which there was such
an unaccountable to-do. The impersonal air with which she watched the
men from the Hire Furniture Company stagger down the front steps under
the pseudo-Jacobean fumed-oak dresser was a triumph of dramatic genius.
As the rooms became emptier, you felt that Mother was merely clearing
her decks for bolder action, and that when we had furniture again, it
would be on a nobler, more elegant scale.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dad would have slipped 'round the corner and entered into
negotiations with the neighborhood greengrocer whose account had been
paid up and whose friendship could therefore be relied upon. Not until
after dark, when there would be no prying eyes, would Mother take down
the window curtains and pack the few possessions rightfully our own and
which remained constant through all the changes for better or for
worse&mdash;the bedding, though not the beds, the kitchen pots and
pans, the square black marble-and-gilt clock with the figure of
Britannia resting on her shield staring pensively at a beast which
resembled a poodle more than a lion, the pair of gaily-flowered Royal
Worcester vases which always flanked the clock above every hearth we
gathered round, and a red glass mug engraved with the date of Queen
Victoria's Jubilee.</p>

<p>Close on to midnight the grocer's boy would arrive with his cart.
Dad would tiptoe down the stairs with the parcels and baskets and pile
them on the cart while the boy leaned against the railing and kept a
lookout for "Nosy Parkers." In all this there was nothing original; we
were merely following a tradition long recognized in Clapham and in
other less-favored districts. This maneuver was known in the vernacular
as a "moonlight flit." Obviously, it was a move to cheaper lodgings in
another district where we and our straitened circumstances were as yet
unknown. Also, obviously, it was without the landlord's knowledge.</p>

<p>There must have been families whose moonlight flits were sad and
shamefaced. Not ours. There was something daring and whimsical about
this sort of move which challenged all that was adventurous in our
three natures. Each of us responded to the challenge differently; each
in his own way.</p>

<p>Mother always dressed up to the nines for the occasion. She would
skewer her largest birded hat atop her puffs, twine a marabou boa
elegantly about her neck, and draw on a pair of long, worn, but
carefully mended gray gloves. Catching up her skirt with one hand and
carrying the tea-kettle in the other, she would sweep down the stairs
with a dignity calculated to overpower any lurking landlord.</p>

<p>In Dad, jauntiness rose over dignity. He would cock his bowler at an
angle, and thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat, he would chaff the
grocer's boy, making him a partner in the adventure.</p>

<p>At a signal from Dad the boy would push off with his cart, Dad would
gallantly offer Mother his arm, and they would follow. I would bring up
the rear of the little procession. So we moved through Clapham's silent
streets, pioneers setting forth into the unknown to start a new home in
a new and untried land. The adventure tingled in my toes. Where the
moon or a street lamp splashed the pavement with light, my feet would
begin to dance....</p>

<p>The sun was shining when I opened my eyes on my first morning
glimpse of London. Immediately things began to happen. Phones rang,
flowers arrived, photographers snapped cameras at me, and the press
began asking how it felt to be home again after six years "in the
States."</p>

<p>I could tell them in one word: wonderful.</p>

<p>All that day and through the week that followed, lunching, teaing,
and dining with old friends, applying to the proper bureaus for ration
cards, gas mask, tin hat (quite fetching when worn at just the right
tilt), and a National Service Permit to enter restricted areas, I was
discovering and making acquaintance with a London that was strange to
me.</p>

<p>I thought I knew London in every possible mood&mdash;gay and
handsome and smart and ceremonious as she was during the coronation
summer of 1937&mdash;I was there for that brilliant high tide of
midsummer pomp. Officially I was "resting" while Rachel Crothers
rewrote and polished <i>Susan and God</i>. Actually, I was entertaining
myself and being entertained by the gayest season London had had in
many years and the last she was to see for a long time to come. During
those weeks, when the old city was washed and brushed and bedecked,
like a doting grandmother for the marriage of a favorite grandson, all
of us drank deep of our pleasure. Perhaps we had a premonition of what
lay just ahead. Anyway, that London of 1937 came the closest to
Edwardian London of any other season since World War I.</p>

<p>Sometime before I was there playing in <i>Tonight at 8:30</i>. All
that season there was a hush over England; people spoke softly, nobody
made plans. Everyone waited for the bulletins which gave us news of the
King's condition. You felt the imminent passing of an era. I had a
small radio in my dressing room at the theater and would turn it on
between acts to pick up the news from the B.B.C. The news, to everyone
in England that year, meant one thing&mdash;news of the King.</p>

<p>One night when we knew the King was very low, Douglas Fairbanks,
Jr., was in my dressing room waiting for the final curtain. When I came
off the stage and into the dressing room, the radio was tuned in and I
didn't need to ask questions. Douglas' face told me that the last
bulletin had not held out much hope. Very quickly I changed, and
Douglas and I took a taxi to Buckingham Palace. It was impossible to
get close, because the Mall and all the wide space in front of the
gates were crowded. Thousands of Londoners and people up from the
country were packed shoulder to shoulder in a silent, motionless mass.
We joined the others and waited.</p>

<p>I remember seeing Claire Luce, in a bright scarlet coat, wedged into
the crowd. She was then playing in <i>Gay Deceivers</i>, and she had
come just as she stepped off the stage, even with her make-up on.</p>

<p>There was nothing one could do, but somehow there was no other place
one wanted to be at that moment. Every quarter of an hour or so someone
came out of the palace and posted a new bulletin on the board fastened
to the gates. Then the whole crowd moved forward as one man. The two or
three in a position to read the typewritten notice passed the word
back. The message rippled through the crowd: "The King is sinking." I
held on very tight to Douglas' arm and he to mine. We were rumored as
being engaged, but just then and there personal relationships did not
count for much.</p>

<p>Presently a new notice was put on the board. Again that urgent sweep
forward of the crowd, like the tide pushing its way into a cove. But
this time there was no ripple or whisper. Silently those in the front
rank stepped back and removed their hats; then from the crowd as from
one man there rose a single sigh.</p>

<p>We were wedged too close to turn. I was squeezed between Douglas and
another very tall young man. I saw him sweep off his hat. There were
tears running down his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess that's that," he said. His voice told me he was an
American.</p>

<p>The words wrote an end to a chapter.</p>

<br>


<p>The big event of my first day was getting in touch with Richard. He
phoned he could get leave and asked me to come down and meet him at his
base the next day, which was Saturday. We arranged that I would take
the nine-thirty train from Waterloo. I arrived at the station a good
half-hour beforehand only to be told the train had been canceled in the
night. As no one seemed to think this was unusual, I got the impression
that train schedules were pretty uncertain things even though the
traffic was described as normal. I went back to the hotel and filled in
time until I should start for the next train, which was scheduled to
leave at eleven-thirty. However, I allowed myself plenty of time and
took up my stand at gate No. 10 as the station guard had instructed me
to do. There were so few people standing there I thought I was in luck,
but this optimism was immediately shattered by a voice from the
loudspeaker which announced: "Passengers waiting for the eleven-thirty
to Portsmouth will please join the queues by the boards marked '5' and
'6.'" Before these gates stretched two apparently endless queues, one
made up of servicemen&mdash;British, American, Canadian; the other, of
civilians. I added myself to the tail of the latter queue and waited
with what patience I could muster. Slowly the procession shuffled a few
steps nearer the still-distant gate. I kept my eye on my Newfoundland
watch while my hopes of joining Richard that day evaporated. At
eleven-thirty the voice spoke again: "The eleven-thirty is now full.
The twelve forty-five has been canceled. The next train leaves at
one-thirty."</p>

<p>I dropped out of line and set about planning a campaign. I dashed
back to the near-by Savoy, where I changed into my American Red Cross
uniform; then I returned to Waterloo Station and elbowed my way into
the queue with the armed forces. After standing in line an hour and a
half, I found a place on the one-thirty train.</p>

<p>It was quite an experience, but worth it. Richard met me. After many
months of service overseas, he, apparently, was quite philosophic about
trains which do not run and, when they do, cannot accommodate all of
the passengers. We had a lovely day together and I returned to London
the next morning. I was still wearing my Red Cross uniform and having
lunch in the Savoy Grill when who should come along but Basil Dean. He
stared at me.</p>

<p>"What are you doing in that uniform, Gertie?"</p>

<p>I explained. Whereupon he commanded me to go at once and be fitted
for an E.N.S.A. uniform. Having known Basil since I was a child when he
"managed" me, I meekly obeyed.</p>

<p>At first there seemed to be a great deal of hush-hush about the unit
to which I was to be assigned, where we were to go, and&mdash;most
important of all&mdash;when we were to start. All I could find out was
that we were headed for an eight-weeks tour of Great Britain, during
which we would be called on to give three shows a day, with a lot of
motoring between shows.</p>

<p>Rehearsals were called in one of the underground cellars of Drury
Lane Theatre, which had been bombed during the blitz, but which was
still the E.N.S.A. headquarters.</p>

<p>At the first rehearsal I learned that ours was to be known as The
Gertrude Lawrence Unit, a tremendous honor and one which made me feel a
bit shy and self-conscious, especially as the others in the unit had
all been together since the opening of E.N.S.A. But the ice was quickly
broken over a couple of beers, and soon everyone was talking shop as
pros do when and wherever they get together.</p>

<p>The only non-professional among us was Mary Barrett, whose position
in the unit was that of shepherd, manager, confidential adviser,
trouble-shooter, and bodyguard. Surely, that should give her
professional rating. Mary had been Gracie Fields' secretary-companion
when Gracie was in England, and consequently knew the ropes. She could
improvise a costume at the last minute if the wardrobe trunks failed to
turn up. With equal skill and speed, she could contrive to cook a
supper over a gas ring out of whatever the shops or the rations
offered. She had the soothing tact of a career diplomat and the
adroitness of a ward politician. No one ever heard her grouse or
complain of weariness, lack of sleep, or even the temperament of our
performers.</p>

<p>We put on our first show and a big B.B.C. broadcast at a factory in
Ilford on the outskirts of London for twenty-five hundred workers. The
plant turned out radio parts for planes and was working at full
production speed. The show gave me a chance to try out some of the
songs I had brought over from America, but while I realized that these
factory workers were doing a tremendously important job, nevertheless
it was the troops I had come over to sing to. I was impatient to start
our tour of the camps.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, during the week of waiting, I was discovering more things
about the British people than I had ever thought about before.</p>

<p>I heard very little talk about the war. In fact, I rather got the
idea no one was expected to talk about it. Perhaps this was because
everyone&mdash;men and women&mdash;was doing some sort of war service.
Everybody had to do fire watching on the roofs. Nobody whined about the
servant problem, because there weren't any servants to whine about. A
maid might be allowed to a household in which a certain number of
persons were billeted. Otherwise people were cooking their own meals
and making a practice of eating out whenever possible. Shopping took
endless time. I saw Londoners of every social class queuing up for
hours in front of the fish shops. The streets were full of bicycles.
Everyone cycled to and from his job. The boots that pressed the pedals
were patched on the soles, but they were well polished. This meant that
the wearer had done the polishing himself. That below-stairs character
so dear to Dickens and to the writers and illustrators of
<i>Punch</i>&mdash;I mean the British "boots"&mdash;had joined up, or
was making munitions.</p>

<p>People looked very fit, especially the women, most of whom were in
some sort of uniform&mdash;the WRENS, ATS, Red Cross, et cetera.
Everyone was busy all the time, but there was no rush or excitement. No
one was breathless. You felt that without deliberate effort or any
bravado everyone was carrying on the accustomed pattern of life as
consistently as possible.</p>

<p>London was full of American correspondents. They kept popping up
wherever you went. Allan Michie, who was commissioned to cover the
invasion for the <i>Reader's Digest</i>, Liebling of the <i>New
Yorker</i>, Hemingway on an assignment for <i>Collier's</i>, and
several others I ran into, were fuming because word had gone around
that they would not be allowed to go across with the British forces.
General Eisenhower had apparently given permission, but some liaison
officer on the staff said there was no room for them, so they were
muttering and cursing. I was a sympathetic listener. I heard many
accounts of the early days of the Battle of Britain. For instance,
there was the story that during the early days of home-guard training
the men were given beer bottles&mdash;three apiece&mdash;filled with
some kind of mild explosive. With these homemade grenades they were
expected to knock out the German tanks as they advanced up the beaches.
These were like the famous "Molotov Cocktails."</p>

<p>Things were different now. Munitions in more formidable quantities
were being turned out by the war plants for the invasion of Europe.
Ernest Byfield, acting as war correspondent for the Hearst press, told
me it took ten thousand pairs of nylon stockings to make one towrope
for a glider plane, and at least a thousand gliders are needed for an
air-borne invasion. "That should be broadcast to the black-market
shoppers in America and elsewhere."</p>

<p>I agreed.</p>

<p>"When peace comes, instead of beating swords into plowshares, I
suppose we will convert our towropes into stockings."</p>

<p>"And our tin hats into ash trays," I added.</p>

<p>We laughed about it, but, actually, we had learned the British way
of thinking, which is that, no matter how the war is going, and in
spite of the changes it imposes on everybody, the day will inevitably
come when the established, comfortable, peaceful life, which every
British person considers no more than his due, will return.</p>

<p>I was made aware of this national psychology the evening I went to
dine with Daisy Neame in Eaton Square. On my way there I passed a sign
which read: "Horse Shelter." That is something I am sure could exist
only in Great Britain. I spoke of it at dinner and was told that the
regulations regarding the treatment of animals during air raids were
very strict. When the alert sounds, horses must be unharnessed
immediately from carts and led to designated places of shelter before
the driver takes cover.</p>

<p>Of course horses are valuable, especially during the shortage of
petrol. Somehow one also feels behind those horse shelters the sporting
instincts of the British, as well as the indomitable humanitarianism of
all those tender-hearted ladies who used to write letters to the
<i>Times</i> regarding the treatment of animals. It would take a lot
more than the German blitz to lessen the British sense of
responsibility toward horses, dogs, cats, birds, and even donkeys.</p>

<p>The war has altered some aspects of British life unbelievably.
Daisy's door was opened by her husband Lionel. Butlers have become
extinct, even in Eaton Square. Everything was as I remembered it except
for three unusual vehicles standing in the hall. These were the two
bicycles on which Lionel and Daisy pedal to their respective war jobs.
The third was the baby's pram which Daisy told me she wheeled herself,
to give the infant an airing, when she went out to do the marketing.
Another innovation in Mayfair. The British "nannies" in their correct
gray uniforms and caps with flaring streamers have been blitzed out of
London's life.</p>

<p>When we went in to dinner the table looked just as lovely as usual.
The silver had the wonderful blue sheen that comes only from frequent
vigorous polishings. The damask was lustrous, and the centerpiece of
heavy-headed tulips was like a cluster of glowing jewels. The men, of
course, were in uniform. Daisy and I wore short black dresses. Yes, it
was all almost prewar. But one thing was missing&mdash;there were no
servants to wait on us.</p>

<p>When we had finished the first course, "Here we go," said Daisy,
rising and leading the way to the sideboard. She slid back the shutter
of a little window she had had cut in the wall between the dining room
and the service pantry. Daisy went around into the pantry and received
the plates each of us passed to her through the window; then she handed
us plates with the next course, which we carried back to the table and
proceeded to eat with enjoyment. Daisy had cooked the food herself, and
I must say she had done a very good job.</p>

<br>


<p>I found a tremendous interest in America&mdash;a genuine curiosity
about what Americans thought, what they were doing, and how they felt
about the British. Everything sent from the U.S.A. had become
extraordinarily valuable and desirable. I don't suppose that at any
time since the reign of James I, when the first British colonies were
established in America, has the world beyond the Atlantic held out such
riches as it does today.</p>

<p>The British are rediscovering America.</p>

<p>Later, thinking over the things I had seen going about London, I
began to ask myself why I took this imperturbability without surprise.
Because I wasn't surprised by it at all. Somehow or other, deep down in
me, was the knowledge that of course these people would act in exactly
this way. What would have surprised me would have been to find them
changing their manner of living, forsaking their ideals of behavior and
their standards of what is pleasant, enjoyable, and worth while; and
doing this at the crack of Herr Hitler's whip.</p>

<p>Inherently and instinctively I knew these things about the British
people because I had known and loved Granny. Though her life was lived
a very long stone's throw from Mayfair, Granny, nevertheless, was a
perfect personification of the British character. She represented the
backbone of the nation.</p>

<br>


<p>"Mark my words, Alice, the child has talent."</p>

<p>Whenever Granny said "mark my words," she became the family oracle,
to be heard and heeded with respect.</p>

<p>She spoke composedly, continuing to rock in her wheel-back armchair
with her feet resting on the brass fender rail, while her knitting
needles clicked without ceasing.</p>

<p>I have no way of knowing just when Granny decided that I was
destined for the theater. She and Grandfather, whom I chiefly remember
because he suffered from a disease called chalky gout, had strongly
disapproved of their daughter Alice's alliance with the profession.
Perhaps they accepted the fact that the offspring of that unfortunate
union was doomed from the moment of conception, and could not,
therefore, be held back from her dark destiny. At any rate, I never
remember Granny putting up any objections to my frankly expressed
ambition to go on the stage.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, she encouraged me. Whenever I stayed with her we
would play theater. The program started with me coming through the
sitting-room door to bow to her as the audience and make my opening
speech which began: "Ladies and gentlemen, I am about to appear." I
would then disappear and get dressed up for the performance.</p>

<p>During those early years, when our family finances went up and down
with the nervousness of a barometer during a September equinox, Granny
represented security, stability, and assurance,</p>

<p>The stability was to be found in her cozy little sitting room in
Sandmere Road with its crocheted antimacassars on the chairs and the
embroidered lambrequin draped along the mantelshelf. A pair of china
Staffordshire dogs&mdash;white with red splotches&mdash;stood guard on
either side of the over-mantel mirror.</p>

<p>The large gilt-framed engraving hanging above the horsehair sofa,
showing Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort surrounded by their
progeny, was flanked by a similarly framed engraving of King Edward and
Queen Alexandra. All my life, since those early days in Granny's
sitting room, I have looked upon Queen Victoria as a most extraordinary
woman; one who apparently, without the aid of hatpins or elastic, could
balance a small, teetery crown on top of her smoothly brushed head at
the same time as she dandled an obese infant on her satin-draped
knee.</p>

<p>Granny was a mine of information concerning the Royal Family. Their
births, marriages, coronations, widowings, and deaths provided her with
constant and unlimited romance and drama. The British Royal Family
belonged to her, as if they were a very superior family of paper dolls.
Whenever I went to see Granny, I would ask her about the different
members of the Royal Family, and she would tell me, confidentially, all
the latest goings-on. I was under the impression that Granny was very
much in the know about whatever happened at Buckingham Palace, Windsor,
or Sandringham which was summed up in the impressive words "at
Court."</p>

<p>A Bible and a worn black leather Book of Common Prayer were always
on the little table beside Granny's bed in her bedroom, where
everything smelled of Pears' Soap and lavender water. These represented
the second article of Granny's faith; for if article one of her simple
creed was her trust in the Crown, article two was her unquestioned
faith in the Church of England.</p>

<p>Granny's respect for these two institutions was founded upon her
equally categorical respect for herself and her class. So long as she
did her duty toward her King on high and toward her King here below,
she had every right to expect State and Church to do their duty toward
her. There was no subservience in Granny's attitude toward king or
bishop. She simply paid them the respect due the dignity of their
positions, and in return she expected the State to give her security in
this life, and the Church to usher her into a seat on the right hand of
the Lord in the next.</p>

<p>Frequently on Sunday evenings I would go to church with her,
carrying her prayerbook and finding the hymns from the numerals put up
on the hymn boards beside the chancel. Granny and I shared the
hymnbook, and our voices&mdash;hers still sweet, but a little husky and
sometimes off key, mine higher, steadier, and a complete imitation of
the boys' in the choir&mdash;would unite in the hymns and psalms which
we both enjoyed immensely.</p>

<p>Many of the hymns were puzzling to me, and not a few of them seemed
rather nasty with their references to sweat, wounds, and blood. How
amazing that Granny, who had very strict ideas about what was and what
was not nice, could still warble piously:</p>

<blockquote><i>"There is a place where Jesus sheds</i><br>
<i>The oil of gladness on our heads;</i><br>
<i>A place than all besides more sweet:</i><br>
<i>It is the blood-bought mercy seat."</i></blockquote>

Religion, I thought, was certainly a very rum business. Take the word
"bloody," for instance. What made this word quite proper in church and
unforgivable in ordinary conversation?

<p>Sometimes when Granny's rheumatism got the better of her piety, she
would send me to church as her representative. Then I would be
entrusted with the prayerbook and a sixpence for the offertory, tucked
into the palm of my white cotton glove.</p>

<p>When I returned, Granny would ask expectantly: "Well, my dear, what
was the sermon like? And what was the text?"</p>

<p>Following this lead, I would turn a chair around to form a pulpit
and proceed to deliver a digest of the vicar's remarks for her
appreciation. Of course it was necessary to dress up for this in
Grandfather's coat and one of his collars, both worn back to front to
give me a clerical look. I must say I think I did the part of the
reverend gentleman rather well, though I improved on his gestures and
dramatized his style of delivery. Keeping in character, I would sing
the hymns for Granny&mdash;not always those which we had sung at the
service, but others which were my favorites.</p>

<p>After service Granny and I would have a cup of tea, and then,
feeling relaxed and ready for a bit of amusement after all this
edification, she would encourage me to sing for her songs she had
taught me: "The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo," "She's Only a
Bird in a Gilded Cage," and "Champagne Charlie Is Me Name." For this
act Grandfather's coat and collar were readjusted, his bowler hat and
walking stick were produced, and the show was on.</p>

<p>Granny's frankly expressed preference was for little girls who were
plump and rosy-checked. Tall, thin, sallow children looked half starved
to her, and, therefore, she worried over my natural gawkiness.</p>

<p>"The child needs fattening up, Alice. Look at her. She's all
legs."</p>

<p>"She's growing fast, Mother. I have to keep letting down the hems of
her dresses until there is no more stuff to let out."</p>

<p>Granny sniffed. "It's the Danish blood, I expect. The Danish princes
are all over six feet. And Her Majesty is extremely tall; though a fine
figure of a woman, of course."</p>

<p>I preened to this. "Her Majesty" meant Queen Alexandra. I felt I had
a special share in Her Majesty, who had come from Denmark, my father's
country, and after whom I had been named.</p>

<p>Granny's next remark, however, dashed my self-esteem. "She's sallow
too. I never did like a puny child. Some Scott's Emulsion would do her
good. Mark my words, Alice, you'd do well to get a bottle and give her
a spoonful night and morning."</p>

<p>"Very well, Mother. If you think so."</p>

<p>I loathed Scott's Emulsion, I gagged over each spoonful of the
beastly stuff; but I knew better than to rebel. I had heard Granny's
orders. So I was brought up on Scott's Emulsion to fatten me up,
camphorated oil for my constant chest colds, and Parrish's Chemical
Food, which was supposed to be a tonic. But I was no advertisement for
all or any of these remedies, and Granny would sigh:</p>

<p>"Well, Gertie, I suppose you are just one of Pharaoh's lean
kine."</p>

<p>Out of love, she made it sound like a compliment. Not to worry her,
I submitted to Mother's habit of pinching my cheeks to make them look
rosy whenever we approached Granny's doorstep. I even resorted to the
trick of pinching my own cheeks when alone on her doorstep, waiting for
her to let me in.</p>

<p>The popular taste was still for buxom beauties. His Majesty King
Edward could 'ave 'is Jersey Lily; the British workingman preferred a
nice generous armful.</p>

<p>The winter I was ten, and at a time when our finances hit rock
bottom, Mother got herself a job in the chorus in a Christmas
production of <i>Babes in the Wood</i> at the Brixton Theatre. The
casting director studied her pleasing curves, listened to her voice,
which was a very good soprano, and for once did not ask her to lift her
long skirts to show her legs. This was fortunate, for though Mother had
pretty ankles, the rest of her below the waist seemed to have no
relation to the part of her above the waist. However, she had no false
notions about her shape, and she had a very practical mind.</p>

<p>Having signed the contract, she came home with the flesh-colored
tights supplied by the wardrobe mistress. Putting them on, she
instructed me how to pad the legs of this garment with cotton wool to
give her the much-desired and seductively rounded thighs which she
unfortunately lacked. Of course it was possible to buy tights thus
treated. These were called symmetricals. But they were very expensive,
consequently necessity drove us to make ours at home.</p>

<p>Mother would stand on a chair in front of a mirror and direct me as
I poked the wads of cotton down inside the silk tights. It was a long
and tedious job, because the padding had to be sewn in smoothly so that
it would not be detected.</p>

<p>Though I was only ten, I understood very clearly that her job in the
chorus and the thirty shillings she was to get each week meant bread
and groceries and coal and gaslight for us at home. I was well aware
that it was up to me to make those legs satisfy the theater patrons and
the eagle eye of the manager.</p>

<p>That is how I learned at a still tender age that frequently a
woman's legs (and not her face) are her fortune.</p>

<p>Finally, after a week of waiting and rehearsals, our unit got its
orders to leave for Southampton.</p>

<p>There were eighteen of us, and we traveled in three cars&mdash;one
large bus, one van for equipment, and a car for Mary, Stanley Kilbourn,
my pianist, and me, with our driver.</p>

<p>Our first concert was aboard H.M.S. <i>Collingwood</i>. We had a
great crowd&mdash;about thirty-five hundred enlisted personnel, WRENS,
officers, the commodore, and his wife.</p>

<p>During my week of waiting in London I had been required to submit to
the official censor the songs I had brought over from America to sing
to the boys. Two of the songs were rated "not quite suitable for the
B.B.C.," but they were finally passed as O.K. for the servicemen.</p>

<p>The songs I worked over and which I sang at that first concert were
"A Lovely Way to Spend an Evening," which was one of Frank Sinatra's
successes; Gertrude Niesen's song "I Wanna Get Married" from <i>Follow
the Girls</i>, and "A Guy Named Joe." I also had the saga of an
air-raid-shelter romance, entitled "'E Vanished When the All-Clear
Came." The last two numbers were written especially for me by two
American boys, Bus Davis and Jim Carhart.</p>

<p>The most delightful surprise of the concert aboard H.M.S.
<i>Collingwood</i> was finding Richard seated in the front row. He had
got leave for a couple of hours. There wasn't even time enough for him
to take me back to the hotel in Portsmouth where Mary Barrett and I had
been billeted; he had to return to his base. But even that glimpse of
him was wonderful. It set me up no end.</p>

<p>I had just got into bed and was feeling terribly grateful for it
after a long, hot, tiring, but exciting day.</p>

<p>"Good night, Mary. Have a nice, long, restful night."</p>

<p>"Good night," came Mary's voice from the other room, and, almost
like a punctuation to that response, the sudden shriek of the
sirens.</p>

<p>They were coming.</p>

<p>I sat up in bed in the dark and waited for the sound of the guns
which would tell us the Germans were overhead. I shivered&mdash;not, I
hoped, from fear, but from the suspense of waiting. I was under no
misapprehension as to the amount of damage the raiders had done and
could do to a town like Portsmouth. I had seen it with my own eyes.</p>

<p>Presently the guns started. It was strange to sit there in bed in
the midst of my first real war experience. Between the enemy bombs and
our own guns Portsmouth was actually the front. Yet in the street below
people were calmly walking to air-raid shelters. One man went by
whistling: "I Dream of Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair."</p>

<p>The "all clear" came after about an hour, and I dropped off to
sleep. The next thing I knew Mary Barrett was shaking me awake. The
guns were going like mad again. We sat and waited. Nothing happened; so
Mary curled up on the foot of my bed and we dozed off until all at once
the rocket gun on the sea front went off. We both shot up and out of
the bed, grabbed our papers, and prepared to dash out of the hotel if
the hotel people notified us to do so. We had been told the rocket guns
were not fired unless the enemy was overhead and flying low. They are
precision guns and fire directly on the target; but, although they are
very powerful, they apparently haven't a very long range. The noise
they made was incredible; as if Jerry were dropping blockbusters. I
really thought we had been hit, and my reaction&mdash;born of
nerves&mdash;was to get the giggles!</p>

<p>Mary had been through it all many times over, on all the war fronts.
She said the thing to do was to stay there in the room unless someone
came and yanked us out. The only one who did turn up was Stanley, who
came running down the corridor to see if we were all right. Stanley had
been bombed out of four different homes during the blitz, and, as he
put it, he was "fed oop with it all."</p>

<p>They chased Jerry out to sea about 2:30 A.M., then the "all clear"
sounded, and we went back to bed and to sleep.</p>

<br>


<p>Next day Richard rang up to find out how I felt about it all. Now I
could speak as a war veteran and I told him rather loftily that it felt
better than being three thousand miles away, getting the news over the
radio, and wondering where and how <i>he</i> was.</p>

<p>I saw some of the night's damage that day and the next, during which
our unit covered the entire Southampton area. There was a new and very
nasty hole in the side of the building next to our hotel.</p>

<p>Every noon we put on the show at a plane factory or a shipyard or in
a hangar for the workers, and at night we gave concerts at the camps.
At the Civic Theatre in Southampton we played to some eight thousand
men and women, representing all the Allied nations and all branches of
the service, and from there we went on to give a show under
canvas&mdash;and in a pouring rain&mdash;at camp C. 22 for two thousand
American and British Rangers.</p>

<p>The whole area was feeling the suspense of approaching D-Day. No
one, of course, would, or could, say when that would be, but the bases
and the men were being "sealed." Driving home from a secret concert at
Broderick for Americans and British about to leave, we passed thousands
of "ducks" all lined up along the road to Southampton, ready to pull
out at dawn for somewhere.</p>

<p>At the end of the show at C. 22, our manager, Norman Adams, called
me aside and told me orders had just come through that our unit was to
return to London immediately. In fact, he said, our show that night,
which had gone particularly well, had almost been canceled in the
middle of the bill. It seems that word had come through that the entire
post was to be "sealed" and all E.N.S.A. units would have to evacuate
or be sealed in until after D-Day for security reasons.</p>

<p>After swearing me to secrecy, Adams collected the whole unit and led
us all to the officers' mess for refreshments. The mess was just a tent
with a trestle table, but they put on quite a good meal for us, and the
refreshment was good old bathtub gin with the kick of a bronco. As we
laughed and joked, I wondered whether the fellows knew that I knew this
was to be their last party for a long, long time. No mention was made
of their departure, but as they crowded around our cars and shouted and
waved to us as we drove away into the darkness back to London, I had
the horrid feeling we were deserting them.</p>

<p>On arriving in London we were immediately re-routed to another
coastal area. It turned out to be Brighton.</p>

<p>My orders came through to be ready to start on the morning of June
5. After leaving the Savoy, we drove through the districts of London
that were home to me as a child&mdash;past Kennington Oval, past the
"Horns Hotel" where my father had sung at smoking concerts for a guinea
a night, past the Brixton Theatre where I made my stage debut at the
age of ten for the magnificent sum of six shillings per week in that
same Christmas play in which Mother had worn her homemade
symmetricals.</p>

<p>The manager wanted a child who could sing and dance with nine others
in a troupe, and one who could be trusted to be on time for the show
and not get into mischief. Mother promised she would take care of all
that, and I was taken on.</p>

<p>We children were little robin redbreasts in the forest ballet when
the "Babes" got lost in the wood. Dressed in brown tights, very
wrinkled at the knees, our skinny bodies clad in musty feathers and
with hats which had beaks in front, we covered the two unfortunate
children with artificial leaves to keep them from the cold until they
were rescued by Robin Hood and his Merry Men. Mother was one of the
Merry Men! I can remember to this day the song which Robin Hood sang in
this scene. The chorus went like this:</p>

<blockquote><i>There's a little green patch at the top of the
hill,</i><br>
<i>Climb, boys, climb.</i><br>
<i>And it's there we can rest at our pleasure and will</i><br>
<i>Climb, boys, climb.</i><br>
<i>Though the way be dreary and your heart be weary,</i><br>
<i>It will all come right in time.</i><br>
<i>There's a little green patch at the top of the hill,</i><br>
<i>So climb, boys, climb.</i></blockquote>

This was sung with great gusto, accompanied by the marching up and down
and suitable gestures and hearty thigh slappings of Mother and the
seven other Merry Men.

<p>At this time Mother had a friend, who was a friend of the mother of
Ivy Shilling who played Alice when Lewis Carroll's immortal story was
dramatized for a Christmas production. I was taken to see the play. We
sat in a box, which was the first time in my life I ever enjoyed such
prominence. I watched every move, every gesture of Alice's, and my envy
of Ivy Shilling gave me no rest until I nagged Mother into taking me to
Miss Conti's dancing school, at which she was a pupil.</p>

<p>Miss Italia Conti held a unique place in the world of the British
theater. She had a basement studio just off Great Portland Street where
the boys and girls she accepted as pupils practiced dance steps, did
acrobatic exercises on the horizontal bar, and were taught elocution
and the rudiments of the drama. The studio was a big room lined with
mirrors in which you could see yourself from every angle, and at one
end was a small stage with a piano.</p>

<p>Mother had no money to pay for dancing and singing lessons for me.
Dad had suffered a run of bad luck for months, and we had moved to
cheaper and still cheaper lodgings. My education did not benefit by
these flittings about Clapham and Brixton; whenever we moved into a new
district it usually meant my entering a new school. It also meant
finding myself one of a new group of children, who stood off and eyed
me suspiciously.</p>

<p>The boys and girls at Miss Conti's eyed me too. But their glances
were different. They looked at me appraisingly&mdash;not for my clothes
or where I lived, but for what I was able to do. Many of them had been
born into theatrical families. All of them aspired to stardom.</p>

<p>I sang and danced for Miss Conti, and she thought me sufficiently
talented to offer to give me free lessons. On these terms I was
enrolled one afternoon a week for a six weeks' trial period. If I
showed promise, I had the opportunity of staying on as a pupil-teacher,
thereby repaying my tuition.</p>

<p>I am a little hazy about those weeks at Miss Conti's. It was an
entirely new world to me. I am under the impression that Noel Coward
was already a pupil there when I started. If he was not, he came very
soon after, because Noel figures largely in all my memories of Miss
Conti. Anton Dolin joined the school later to study Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Noel was a thin, unusually shy boy with a slight lisp. He was
studying elocution, acting, and dancing (or should I say deportment?)
and was one of Miss Conti's star pupils. Noel's people were in a
position to give him educational advantages. They were "comfortably
situated."</p>

<p>Noel wasn't snobbish about this; in fact, he and I, who were about
the same age, entered at once into an alliance.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean that Noel wasn't occasionally condescending to me,
but this condescension sprang from a quite natural masculine impulse to
put in her place an irrepressible and very plain-looking small girl who
had the annoying faculty of getting herself noticed. I could put up
with the condescension. What I could not have endured was to have Noel
ignore me.</p>

<p>However, even at the age of eleven I suffered no illusions as to
what constituted the charm I had for Noel Coward. I was the proud
possessor of a bicycle, bought for me from the boy next door by a
friend of Dad's. The bicycle originally had a bar across the middle,
but Mother, ever practical, paid a man to saw this off so a girl could
ride it. However, even she could not alter the drooping handlebars
which showed it was a boy's model. Noel pointed this out
immediately:</p>

<p>"It's quite unsuitable for a girl."</p>

<p>He could not conceal from me the fact that he wanted a bicycle,
which was something his family would not permit him to have.</p>

<p>But Noel had a possession which I secretly coveted&mdash;a
phonograph with a large spreading horn. He also owned a stack of
records. So we made a deal. He could ride my bicycle in return for
lending me his phonograph for the same length of time. I imagine that
sort of lend-lease is as good a basis for a lifelong friendship as any
other.</p>

<p>Noel's records greatly increased my acquaintance with the popular
music of the day. They also brought me the beauty of "The Blue Danube,"
the sweet rhythm of "Valse Triste," and the sticky romance of the
"Indian Love Lyrics."</p>

<p>So once a week I packed my small attach&Atilde;&copy; case
containing my toe-dancing slippers, my practice clothes, soap and a
towel, and took the bus to Great Portland Street, always in the hope
that Noel would be there.</p>

<p>Miss Conti had undertaken to teach me to dance and to sing, at least
to the extent of fitting me to appear in one of the Christmas plays.
These are a part of the holiday season in England, and the theater
managers always went to Miss Conti for child actors to play in them.
Miss Conti found no fault either with my leg work or my vocal efforts.
But my accent, which was pure cockney, caused her to wince. One day she
led me to the piano and, after laying a sheet of paper under the
strings, she struck a chord.</p>

<p>"That, my dear Gertrude," she said, "is what your voice sounds like
to me."</p>

<p>My quick ear recognized the similarity between the tinny vibrations
and my own accent. That was my introduction to phonetics.</p>

<p>I was not good enough to appear in one of the Christmas plays.
However, I was approved for a part in a fairy play called
<i>Fifinella</i>, which was put on at the Repertory Theatre in
Liverpool. We were rehearsed in London, under Miss Conti's careful eye,
and then sent up in the care of a matron and her husband. Estelle
Winwood played the beautiful Fairy Queen, but she made little
impression on me because I had eyes only for the Prince in his scarlet
tights and doublet. This fascinating hero was played by Eric Blore. I
thought him wonderful. And obviously no one had found it necessary to
pad <i>his</i> tights with cotton wool.</p>

<p>The first time Noel and I appeared together was in a German morality
play, <i>Hannela</i>, put on at Manchester, under the direction of Mr.
Basil Dean. Noel and I played angels in white robes, gilded wings, and
sanctimonious smiles. Neither of us, as I remember, cared for the play
or for our parts in it. However, we touched the heart of Noel's kindly
uncle, for he asked permission to take us for an afternoon's
outing.</p>

<p>It was Christmas week, and the shops were full of entrancing things
to buy. By various ruses Noel and I enticed him to one shopwindow after
the other, artfully pointing out what each of us would like to receive
for a Christmas present. But our benefactor was not in a generous mood
that day. Not till the afternoon was nearly over did he weaken and buy
us a large box of peppermint creams, which he made us promise to divide
with the other children in the cast.</p>

<p>Noel and I managed to forget this admonition and to eat most of the
sweets ourselves in the taxi on the way home. Soon I began to feel very
queer. When we went on in the heaven scene, the other celestial beings
seemed to float and bob dizzily around me. I stole a glance at Noel. He
was positively green. Presently the audience was permitted an
unexpected vision of heaven in which two small angels were being
violently sick.</p>

<p>I couldn't have been a total failure as an angel, because soon after
<i>Hannela</i> I was given a job in <i>The Miracle</i> then being put
on by Reinhardt at the Olympia. The play called for one hundred
children&mdash;fifty boys and fifty girls. As we did two shows a day,
and the children came from homes all over London, the London County
Council established a special school for us at Olympia. We had classes
in the mornings, then dinner, after which it was time to dress and be
made up for the daily matinee. Olympia is out beyond Shepherd's Bush, a
wearying, long tram ride home after the evening performance.</p>

<p>It must have been that summer that Dad took Mother and me on a
Sunday excursion to Brighton. The resort was crowded with trippers like
ourselves; the bands kept up a ceaseless accompaniment of music, and
the Pierrot troupes on the sands played to enormous business. I watched
their performance with a critical eye; after all, I was now in the
profession.</p>

<p>On the pier, among other penny-in-the-slot machines was one showing
a gaudily painted picture of a gypsy. The machine promised to tell your
fortune for a penny. I dropped my copper piece into the slot and waited
anxiously while the machine ground out a few bars of a popular tune; it
then proceeded to stick a tongue of pink cardboard at me. There were
words printed on it. I tore off the slip and read my penny destiny:</p>

<blockquote><i>A star danced,</i><br>
<i>And you were born.</i></blockquote>

<p>I accepted my fate without hesitation. The gypsy meant to tell me
that I would be a dancer and someday I would be a star.</p>

<p>A few days later I stopped in at the printers in Clapham High Street
and ordered some cards made. I had written out what I wished the
printer to put on these bits of pasteboard:</p>

<center>LITTLE GERTIE LAWRENCE<br>
<i>Child Actress and Danseuse</i><br>
<br>
BRIXTON THEATRE</center>

<p>I had used the name Lawrence, because that was the stage name Mother
used. I was especially proud of the word "danseuse," which, according
to the old gentleman on High Street who printed the cards, meant
"dancer" in French. Already I could see my name in electric lights on
Shaftesbury Avenue. I had never been to that thoroughfare except on a
bus, but I had heard about it and dreamed of it as children today talk
and dream about Hollywood.</p>

<p>I did not show the pink slip of paper with my fortune to anyone;
perhaps I was afraid it would not come true if I shared the secret. But
my professional cards were different. I scattered them like confetti
and with complete self-assurance.</p>

<p>The mother of "your cousin Ruby," who up to now had produced the
most promising child in the family, said to Mother: "Do you want your
child in that sort of life, Alice? I wouldn't. Not for my Ruby."</p>

<p>"Your Ruby hasn't the temperament," Mother countered. "You've got to
have temperament for the stage."</p>

<p>"Temperament! Well, Alice, you can call it that if you like. Myself,
I'd give a plainer name to it. And when it comes to temperament, anyone
would think you'd had enough of that with Gertie's father. If she was
my child and had his blood in her veins, I wouldn't let her near a
theater. That I wouldn't."</p>

<p>Cousin Ruby's mother had maneuvered Mother into an impossible
situation. She could not defend my father without appearing disloyal to
Dad, or without drawing down on her the obvious retort: "Well, if he
was as good as all that, why did you ever leave him?"</p>

<p>It may have been such conversations as these with my aunt which
unlocked my Mother's reticence. Up until then she had never mentioned
my father to me.</p>

<p>We were out shopping one day when suddenly she stopped to read a
playbill stuck up on a wall. It advertised a minstrel show. Heading the
cast as the star appeared the name: "Arthur Lawrence."</p>

<p>"That's your father, Gertie," said Mother, pointing.</p>

<p>I stared at the name, trying to accustom myself to the idea of a
relationship between this man and me. No one had ever told me much
about my father. I could not remember having seen him or heard of his
taking the slightest interest in my existence. Dad was all the father I
had known, or needed. This strange man on the playbill seemed suddenly
to trespass on Dad's position. I slid a questioning glance at Mother.
She was still staring at the poster. Her voice was suddenly
wistful&mdash;and a little proud: "Well, now you know. He's a fine
singer. You get your talent from him."</p>

<p>We went on, and no more was said about my father. I would have liked
to have gone to the theater to see him and hear him sing, but Mother
did not suggest it. I only had to look at her to realize that the
subject was closed. But the sudden discovery that I had a father who
was a success in the theater set me thinking.</p>

<p>I was now nearly thirteen. For several years I had been appearing in
plays from time to time, earning a few shillings a week. The gypsy had
given assurance that my fortune lay in the theater. As I compared
Dad&mdash;dear, lovable, but unsuccessful&mdash;with my own father,
whose name appeared in big letters on the playbill, a plan began to
develop in my mind. I began to watch the bookings of the minstrel show
starring Arthur Lawrence.</p>

<p>For all that I might not have done anything about it except for two
things which happened simultaneously. We were undergoing one of our
periodic lean periods. These seemed to occur more frequently and lasted
longer as Dad's luck became more and more elusive. And Mother, irked
perhaps by some remark of her sister-in-law on the proper bringing up
of daughters, had become more strict with me.</p>

<p>One evening several months later, when Mother and Dad were out, I
decided to carry out my plan, and I packed a few belongings in a small
straw portmanteau. I then collected all the empty bottles and jars in
the house, returned them to the grocer's, and got the money I needed
for the journey. Wearing my best coat and a large mushroom-shaped hat,
and carrying the portmanteau, I took the tram to the theater where I
knew my father was appearing. A note left on the kitchen table for
Mother and Dad told them of my decision to join my father, and that
they were not to worry.</p>

<p>The stage doorman looked at me suspiciously. "Now then, what do you
want, youngster?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I've come to see Mr. Lawrence."</p>

<p>He frowned. "It's not at all likely Mr. Lawrence will see you. He's
dressing now to go on."</p>

<p>"I'll wait," I said, and set down the portmanteau. "It's very
important."</p>

<p>Perhaps something in my tone made the doorman realize that this was
no ordinary occasion. He squinted at me sharply.</p>

<p>"What's your name? I'll tell Mr. Lawrence you're here."</p>

<p>I swallowed. "Just tell him it's Gertie."</p>

<p>The doorman went away, slamming the door to prevent my slipping in.
For a moment I felt an impulse to turn and run. There was still time to
return to Clapham&mdash;to seize and destroy the penciled note I had
left letting Mother and Dad know my decision. But something&mdash;my
own destiny perhaps&mdash;held me there on the bench inside the stage
door. Presently I heard steps coming along the corridor and a mutter of
voices. The door opened...</p>

<p>A man stood there&mdash;a very tall man who leaned forward to peer
down at me in the dim, flickering light of the gas bracket in its wire
cage. He was in his shirt sleeves and collarless. One half of his face
was smeared with grease and burnt cork. Out of the black face a pair of
very blue eyes stared at me in utter incredulity. He spoke in a deep,
quiet voice:</p>

<p>"Who are you? What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>I drew my card from my pocket and handed it to him. His eyes took in
the printed words, then came back to me.</p>

<p>"I'm Gertie," I said. "And I've come to stay."</p>

<br>
<br>

<h2 id="chapter4">4</h2>
</center>

<br>


<p>Driving down to Brighton on that June day, strangely it was the
memories of the past which were more vivid and more alive in my mind
than the scenes we drove through. That glimpse of Kennington Oval and
Brixton brought back events and persons I had not thought of in years.
For some reason or other, and I suppose only a psychologist could
explain it, this visit home to a fighting England was like a visit to a
psychoanalyst. In <i>Lady in the Dark</i> I had played the part of a
successful businesswoman who had been psychoanalyzed. Her dreams were
reproduced on the stage in fantastic scenes. In somewhat the same way,
recollections of "Little Gertie Lawrence&mdash;child actress and
danseuse," began to form scenes that were scarcely less fantastic than
those imagined by Moss Hart for <i>Lady in the Dark</i>.</p>

<p>Suddenly I smelled again the cold, dusty, tremendously exciting
smell of backstage in that Music Hall Theatre when Father, still
holding my card in one hand, reached out the other and caught me by the
wrist. He pulled me over the threshold, past the doorman, and let the
stage door slam behind us.</p>

<p>"Come along to my dressing room. Curtain's going up in five minutes.
I've got to finish dressing. You can wait there. I'll talk to you later
on. Sit down. And for God's sake, don't cry."</p>

<p>I had begun to weep from relief, fear, and the physical reaction to
the whole adventure.</p>

<p>In the dressing room stood a woman holding the coat Father was to
put on. He paid no attention to her, but went on rapidly blacking the
rest of his face before the mirror. After which he put on a curly black
wig and stuck it down with spirit gum.</p>

<p>"She's Gertie," he said out of the grotesque red mouth he had
quickly painted in the middle of the black face. "She's my kid,
Rose."</p>

<p>Rose did not move. She looked at me not unkindly and I stared back
at her. I was not prepared for Rose.</p>

<p>A callboy went along the corridor calling, "Mr. Lawrence,
please!"</p>

<p>Father turned from the mirror, his make-up completed, and thrust his
arms into the evening coat Rose silently held out for him. He jerked
down his waistcoat, twitched his white tie a fraction of an inch, and
was gone.</p>

<p>Only then Rose turned to me, standing there gripping my portmanteau
and staring. "So you're Arthur's little girl," she said. "How old are
you?"</p>

<p>"I'm thirteen," I said.</p>

<p>"You are! Well..." She looked me over appraisingly. "There's not
much of you."</p>

<p>Rose herself was what Granny would have called a fine figure of a
woman, which meant she had plenty of curves. She had also, I noticed,
very pretty ankles. Show girl, I thought.</p>

<p>Rose told me I had better sit down because we would have a long
wait. A minstrel show wasn't like a play in which the actors frequently
left the stage for long periods. Once the curtain was up, my father
would remain on stage until the end of the act.</p>

<p>During that wait Rose and I became acquainted. She had a kind heart
and there was no guile in her. She loved my father and said so with a
disarming frankness. She continued to tidy up the dressing room. "We've
been together six years, Arthur and me. That's more than a lot of
married couples can say. Oh, not but what we've had our quarrels. And
who hasn't, I'd like to know."</p>

<p>I nodded. I found myself liking Rose, who admitted me so hospitably
into the intimacy of her life. But it was clear that she did not intend
to consider me one of the family.</p>

<p>"You can't stay with us," she went on. "You know that, I suppose?"
(I didn't. How could I, when I had never known of the existence of Rose
until that evening?)</p>

<p>Then she said: "Your mother will be here to fetch you back tonight
or in the morning, and there'll be all hell to pay."</p>

<p>I told her I had left a note for Mother and that I couldn't go back.
But immediately Rose dashed my plans by remarking: "Of course you can't
stay on with Arthur and me. We can't travel you."</p>

<p>Strangely, that possibility had not occurred to me. I began to wish
I had not left the note. Still, I thought, something might happen to
prevent Mother coming. Meanwhile, I had to win Rose over to my side. I
told her about my experience as an actress, emphasizing the fact that
Miss Conti considered I had talent. I showed Rose my card.</p>

<p>She was obviously impressed.</p>

<p>"How nice! Danseuse looks elegant. Quite West End."</p>

<p>"I think so," I agreed complacently.</p>

<p>When Father came off stage, he found us chatting comfortably.
Perhaps this lifted a worry from his mind.</p>

<p>"The kid's all right, Arthur," Rose said. "She's got a lot of you in
her, I'd say." She repeated to him briefly what I had told her about my
experience in the theater. "She must be good."</p>

<p>Was it Rose's acceptance of me which persuaded my father to keep me
with him? I have sometimes thought so. That, and a curious pride in the
child who had followed his profession, made my father suddenly laugh
and say to me: "You can stay with us for tonight, anyway. We'll find a
place for you somewhere in our digs. She can sleep on the sofa, can't
she, Rose? We'll send a telegram to your mother this minute and tell
her you're all right. Tomorrow we can talk things over."</p>

<p>Mother did not appear until the next morning. What passed between my
parents I never knew, but an arrangement was made by which I was to
remain with Father as long as I wished to do so and he would support
me. I was to write to Mother once a week and keep her informed of my
whereabouts. If anything went wrong, she was to be immediately advised
of it and was to come and take me back to live with her.</p>

<p>That is how my life with Father and Rose began. I shared their
lodgings and whatever they had. Whatever I earned, when I had a job,
Father got, under our joint contract, since I was under age.</p>

<p>Although I missed Mother and Dad terribly, I missed Granny even
more. I often thought of her and her tidy little house. I missed the
news of the Royal Family. King Edward VII had died&mdash;his funeral
was the first state pageant I had not read about in history books. Now
all the talk was of the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary. To
me, as to millions of children throughout the Empire, the leading
personage at the forthcoming coronation was the youthful Prince of
Wales. Perhaps our generation derived an immense amount of satisfaction
from the fact that one of us was to occupy a prominent place at the
Abbey ceremony. The newspapers and illustrated weeklies were full of
photographs of H.R.H. Prince Edward and his sister and brothers. The
princess interested me very little, but every photograph of Prince
Edward I came across I cut out and pinned to the wall of my room. The
increasing collection of photographs traveled with me.</p>

<p>And we were constantly on the move, touring the Midlands, swinging
back to London to look for fresh engagements. When we were not working,
I amused myself in any way that I could. I did the shopping for Rose
and helped her keep our lodgings tidy. We made our own clothes, trimmed
our own hats. I made myself a hobble skirt out of a remnant of tweed
when I was fourteen. Rose appreciated these efforts of mine. She was
not a housekeeper, but she was neat, and Father's untidiness was a
constant annoyance to her.</p>

<p>Life wasn't all beer and skittles. Not by any means. Father still
liked his glass, and though he would go several months without
drinking, invariably there came a day when he would become
short-tempered, restless, and start going out between the matinee and
the night show. Finally he would crack up. Then he became ugly, cruel,
and impossible to handle. Neither Rose nor I could do anything with
him.</p>

<p>I began to watch for these drinking bouts and to dread them and the
rows that went on at the theater with the manager and other members of
the company and at home with Rose. In between spells Rose and I formed
a conspiracy to keep Father in bounds. One or the other of us kept
watch over him all the time. We would try to think up schemes for
keeping him happy and entertained, but when our cleverness failed to
win over Father's craving, Rose and I knew we were in for it. Father
would go on drinking, growing more and more sullen, more and more
difficult to handle, until the manager paid us off. Since Father and I
were always on a joint contract, this meant I lost my job when he was
fired. When that happened, he would drink himself into a state in which
he was unable to go out at all. Poor Rose then put him to bed and
nursed him until he sobered. Father would emerge from her hands
chastened, and go out to hunt a new engagement for himself and for me.
We had no agent. We could not afford an agent's commission. It was our
habit to search the "Wanted" ads in the theatrical newspapers.
Sometimes Father heard of something through hanging around the crowds
by the London Hippodrome.</p>

<p>We had been out of work for several weeks and were more than usually
hard up when Father landed a job to play in a touring revival of
Andr&Atilde;&copy; Messager's <i>The Little Michus</i>, a comic
operetta for which his voice was perfect. He came home to the dreary
back room in Camberwell where he and I were then living to tell me the
good news. Rose was away on tour with a concert party. That room which
was divided into two private apartments by a curtain suspended from a
sagging wire represented the ebb tide of our fortunes.</p>

<p>But Father beamed over his good luck. He planked down a couple of
half crowns from the advance he had persuaded the company manager to
give him and said gaily:</p>

<p>"Let's have sausages for supper, Gertie. This calls for a
celebration, my girl."</p>

<p>I pocketed the coins and made ready to go out and do the shopping.
Meanwhile Father ran on about the company and the play. He was to play
M. Michu, the proprietor of a patisserie and the perplexed parent of
twin daughters, Marie Blanche and Blanche Marie&mdash;the "little
Michus." Immediately I pricked up my ears.</p>

<p>"Who will play the girls?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Not a chance of it," Father smiled at me ruefully. "I spoke to the
manager about you. He was interested until he asked me your age, and I
had to tell him fifteen. Then he wouldn't hear of it. He insists he
must have someone older. It's too bad, because you could do it, I'm
sure."</p>

<p>I thought hard. I went to the mirror and studied what I saw there.
What could I do to myself to add three or four years to my age?</p>

<p>"Are you sure he hasn't filled both parts yet?"</p>

<p>Father said he was. "He has one girl. She's about your height. But
she's nineteen or twenty, I'd say."</p>

<p>My hair was long and hung in curls to my waist. I brushed out the
ringlets and for the first time put my hair up. I rummaged in the
cupboard and brought out my one straw hat. I cut off the brim, pinned
on a bunch of cherries, and contrived a toque which could be called
anything but youthful. In my tweed hobble skirt I looked at least
eighteen.</p>

<p>Thus arrayed, and with Father's encouragement, I presented myself at
the manager's office and asked for the job. He tried my voice and
engaged me on a joint contract with Father, as I was still under age,
no matter how old I looked.</p>

<p>Father and I toured with <i>The Little Michus</i> for many weeks.
When Rose's engagement ran out, she joined us. We were playing to good
business and it looked as though the show would have a long run. Then
Father succumbed to one of his drinking spells. Rose and I did our best
to straighten him out and to cover him up. But as the drinking went on
for days, the manager fired him.</p>

<p>This meant that I, too, was once more out of work.</p>

<p>"I'd like to keep you on, kid," the manager said regretfully.
"You're good. But you're under age, and what can I do?"</p>

<p>Rose took Father in hand once more and I searched the columns of
notices in <i>The Stage</i> for a new job. This time I intended to lie
boldly about my age. Rose agreed with me it was the thing to do. "It's
no life for you, being with Arthur," she said. "He's hopeless. I know
that now. You must go on your own. You've got something, Gertie. I
think you're going to get on. You're not pretty and you're too thin for
everybody's taste, but you've got class. You know, I wouldn't be
surprised if you were up in the West End one of these days."</p>

<p>"Oh, Rose. Do you really think so?"</p>

<p>Rose nodded solemnly. "Yes, I do. You've got something that goes
down with a certain kind of audience. High-toned. It's just that you've
got to be seen by the right people. And that takes some doing."</p>

<p>"I'll land something before long," I assured her.</p>

<p>What I landed was a job as chorus girl and understudy in a traveling
revue&mdash;one of the first of its kind&mdash;entitled <i>Miss Plaster
of Paris</i>. I had been forced to lie about my age, but we needed the
money desperately. The man who ran the show and his wife played the
leading parts. I worked in the chorus, played maids, and in one scene
sat on a column. I was selected for this honor because mine was the
smallest posterior in the company.</p>

<p>All week I looked forward to Saturday night when "the ghost walked"
and we were paid. Pay night usually meant a good spree for the manager
followed by a fight with his wife in the course of which he frequently
gave her a black eye, thus paving the way to my appearance in the
leading role the following Monday. For all this excitement and
experience I received fifteen shillings a week.</p>

<p>I managed very well on this sum. Three or four of us lived together,
sharing room rent and pooling our money for the catering purse. We took
turns doing the marketing each day. It was a hard-and-fast rule that we
count the potatoes before giving them to the landlady to cook for us.
She was under orders to boil, not to mash them. This enabled us to be
sure she had not helped herself to a couple of them. Sometimes one of
us would forget to give the order, and when the vegetable dish cover
was lifted, a groan would go up:</p>

<p>"Oh, blast! The old bitch has mashed 'em!"</p>

<p>The manager had an old white bull terrier which traveled with the
show. The bulldog had appeared with his master when he played Bill
Sykes. At rehearsal one day, when we were back in London preparing a
second revue called <i>Miss Lamb o f Canterbury</i>, I was playing with
the dog when he suddenly growled and sank his teeth into my right hand,
refusing to let go.</p>

<p>I fainted. A doctor was sent for. I was cauterized, bandaged, and
told to go home. I was living in lodgings with Father. Rose had finally
left him, "and this time for good," she had asserted. "Enough is
enough, but too much is a little bit too much, if you ask me. And
that's what I've had with Arthur. Oh, I've walked out on him before to
teach him a lesson. And every time he's come round within the fortnight
and made all sorts of promises, and I've listened to him and gone back.
I can't say I've ever taught him a thing except what a man like him
knows already&mdash;that a woman like me can be an awful fool. This
time, though, I don't care about teaching Arthur anything. It's myself
I'm thinking about. And high time too. Myself and you, Gertie."</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you. Because, don't you see if I stay on with your father you
probably will too. And what would happen then? I've been seeing it
coming for the last year. You and I would be working and keeping him.
The way it is, if Arthur wants to eat and drink, he's got to work. And
that means he'll keep sober more or less. Without him, you've got no
one but yourself to think about. This is your chance to get ahead."</p>

<p>There was something in what Rose said. I thought it over and decided
I should stand on my own. Father had been out of work for some time,
but that morning he had told me he had a chance to go to South Africa.
This seemed too good to be true. On the way home a thought struck me:
if he knows what has happened to my hand he may refuse to go so far
away. "He must go. He must," I kept saying all the way home.</p>

<p>Father was there when I arrived. He was tremendously excited. He had
only to sign his contract next day and he would leave in a week.</p>

<p>"You will be all right, won't you, Gertie?" he said eagerly. "You
are getting on fine, and this will be a great chance for me to earn
some decent money and see a bit of the world. South Africa is a great
country. A man can start life over again out there."</p>

<p>I assured him I was at the top of my form, and kept my bandaged hand
behind me, saying nothing of the intense pain. When he finally noticed
the bandage I explained I had cut my hand on a broken glass at
rehearsal. Father never knew the truth about my injury, which took a
long time to heal and left a scar which is still visible. He went off
to South Africa and I managed to keep working. He was gone about a
year. He came home well and bronzed and self-assured. When I met him at
the boat, he introduced me to an enormous, handsome man with whom he
had made friends during his trip. This was Victor McLaglen.</p>

<p>Unfortunately South Africa had not made Father's fortune or changed
his habits. But something had changed in me during the months he was
away. I had learned to stand alone, and by managing to keep on tour I
never lived with Father again. He retired to Brighton, did an
occasional show or a concert, and later on I was able to help him until
his death.</p>

<p>In between jobs I lived at the "Cats' Home" in London so that I
could make the rounds of the theatrical managers' offices. This was a
tall, gaunt house in Charlotte Street which called itself The
Theatrical Girls' Boarding House. Here, for ten shillings a week, you
could luxuriate in a cubicle by yourself. For five shillings you shared
a room with another girl. For half a crown you could have a cot in a
dormitory. I never reached the ten-shilling private-cubicle stage.</p>

<p>There was a great feeling of camaraderie at the Cats' Home. We girls
loaned each other tram fares and clothes to look our best when seeking
a job. There was a sewing room where we made our own clothes, and the
stars of the London theaters used to send their discarded gowns to us
to be raffled off at sixpence a ticket. I remember winning a pink net
evening gown with a harem skirt and ornamented with beads. This I sent
to Mother as a gift. She wrote saying it was beautiful and she was
going to put it in a raffle! That pink net confection may still be
going the rounds.</p>

<br>


<p>These and other memories filled the long, beautiful drive across
Surrey and over the Sussex Downs, which I remembered so well from the
days when I used to drive this way to Brighton to visit Pamela at her
school, Roedean.</p>

<p>Odd to think of Pamela, my daughter, having any connection with the
little girl who ran away to seek her fortune on the stage. The decade
which separated that little girl from Pamela's mother was crowded with
experiences. Four of those years were filled with World War I, toward
the close of which Pamela was born. Long before I had the
responsibility of a child I had entered upon another
responsibility&mdash;one which had remained unfulfilled until I made
this trip to England to entertain the Tommies and the G.I. Joes who
were pledged to defend the way of life I want Pamela and all other
children to have. I shall come to the story of that responsibility and
how I entered upon it a little later.</p>

<p>All the gay Regency recklessness was gone from Brighton. Barbed wire
prevented access to the sea front. The old, well-tanned houses, which
always used to remind me of Indian colonels basking in the sun, with
their backs to the protecting downs, showed plenty of battle scars. But
there was still the old, steady, carrying-on spirit at the Old Ship
Hotel where our unit was billeted. In the old days, when I came to
Brighton, I had a suite at the Albion or the Metropole, but these
places had been taken over by the services, and only the Old Ship
remained for civilians. I was grateful for my billet there&mdash;a
single bedroom without a bath.</p>

<p>It was June 5 when we arrived in Brighton, and we did a show that
night at Tilgate Camp, outside Crawley, in a Nissen hut.</p>

<p>The air in the hut, which was packed with soldiers, wedged shoulder
to shoulder, seemed to quiver with anticipation. It was bound to be
very soon now, almost any hour, that the United Nations would launch
their long-prepared-for blow at the continent. The quivering you felt
was like that of a boxer who draws back a second before lashing out
with both fists at his opponent.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a lovely way to spend an evening," I sang to the rows upon
rows of faces that, from the stage, looked like spume on a
khaki-colored sea. Silly words, and ironic under the circumstances.
These words were on my lips, but while I sang them my heart was
speaking those marvelous lines from <i>King Henry V</i>:</p>

<blockquote><i>Now entertain conjecture of a time</i><br>
<i>When creeping murmur and the poring dark</i><br>
<i>Fills the wide vessel of the universe.</i><br>
<i>From camp to camp through the foul womb of night</i><br>
<i>The hum of either army stilly sounds,</i><br>
<i>That the fix'd sentinels almost receive</i><br>
<i>The secret whispers of each other's watch:</i><br>
<i>Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames</i><br>
<i>Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;</i><br>
<i>Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs</i><br>
<i>Piercing the night's dull ear; and from the tents</i><br>
<i>The armourers, accomplishing the knights,</i><br>
<i>With busy hammers closing rivets up,</i><br>
<i>Give dreadful note of preparation...</i></blockquote>

<p>A country cock crowed, though it was not yet "the third hour of
drowsy morning," when we tumbled out of the cars, before the door of
the Old Ship, and stumbled up the stairs to bed.</p>

<br>


<p>How odd to begin a day so momentous as June 6, 1944, with tea and
toast. A warm breeze which smelled like the wind which blows across the
sand dunes at Dennis lifted my bedroom curtains and set me longing to
go out for a bathe. Brighton was very quiet except for the recurrent
waves of planes flying high overhead&mdash;that monotonous
accompaniment to life in wartime England. The newspaper brought the
news that Rome had been ours since the day before. All dwellers in the
continental coast towns had been warned by the army commander in chief
to evacuate their homes at once. A headline announced that His Majesty
would speak on the air that night.</p>

<p>Were we on the eve of the invasion at last?</p>

<p>I went downstairs with my hands full of letters for the post. It was
the old hall porter, in his green baize apron, who told me that D-Day
was at last a reality. Our forces had set sail for the coast of
Normandy at 5:00 A.M. That tremor I had felt the night before was not
imagined. I had caught the "dreadful note of preparation."</p>

<p>Mary Barrett and I walked out into the sunshine and along the Front.
The people we met were very quiet and looked a little grim, conscious
of what must be taking place only forty-four miles across the Channel.
Whenever a bevy of planes passed overhead, pointing toward France, all
eyes were lifted to them and, I dare say, all hearts. I know mine was.
I wanted desperately to speak to Richard, but I was told all civilian
telephone calls were canceled. I knew he must be in the midst of the
busiest day for the Navy.</p>

<p>On the evening of D-Day our unit was scheduled to do a show on the
pier at Worthing. The spirits of the men in the audience ran high, and
no wonder, with good news coming in that our invading army had made an
advance of ten miles into France within a few hours of landing.
Worthing is only a few miles east of Bognor, where I had my first
glimpse of the sea and where I earned my first sovereign. The Victorian
poets had a fancy for writing odes to places "revisited." This tour of
the south coast was full of such places for me.</p>

<p>The next day, Wednesday, the War Department unsealed a camp for us,
and we motored out toward Lewes to Camp Tanner. The men had rigged up
an old barn to serve as a crude theater. When we arrived there, we
found the troops in the process of moving out for France. Hundreds had
already left. From what one could learn, the invasion was going so
well&mdash;"going according to plan" as Churchill announced to the
Empire&mdash;and the advance into France was so swift more men could be
dispatched immediately.</p>

<p>The troops about to leave were already lined up when we arrived.
They carried all their equipment and were wearing their Mae Wests. A
groan went through the ranks because they thought they would miss our
show.</p>

<p>So we unloaded fast, and the colonel (his name was Bury, and the
outfit was called "Bury's Bashers") let them into the barn theater
where we did our show for them. I sang my songs and then stood out in
the farmyard waving to them as they drove out, headed for France.</p>

<p>It was all like part of a film. There I stood in the middle of that
once-peaceful farmyard, in the brilliant sunshine, tears streaming down
my face, waving good-by to those men&mdash;knowing I was the last woman
to sing them a song for many a weary while.</p>

<p>When the trucks had pulled out, we returned to the barn and did our
show again for the men who were still waiting for orders. Halfway
through the bill we had to stop while the troops were summoned to
muster outside. Again I went out, and kissed them and waved good-by.
Again we struck up "Auld Lang Syne." Above the rumbling of the lorries
rose the sound of men's voices singing the song which I had just taught
them.</p>

<p>By this time Mary Barrett and I were both reduced to pulp. But the
show had to go on; so, with a lumpy throat and an ache in my heart, I
went back to the barn and we did a third show.</p>

<p>There was no one to know that what I was doing there that
afternoon&mdash;and what I was to do for many days at many other camps
throughout England&mdash;was the long-overdue payment of a debt. Bury's
Bashers and the other boys I sang to could not know what I owed to half
a dozen British Tommies of World War I who, before they went out to
fight in Flanders, gave Gertrude Lawrence her chance to become a
star.</p>

<br>


<p>Though I was now entirely on my own, without obligation to Father, I
did not go back to Clapham. What held me back from doing this was
bravado. I had left them and Granny to further my career as an actress.
I was still a long way from achieving that goal and, therefore, I felt
hesitant about going back to the family. Above all, I had no desire to
have the virtues of Cousin Ruby dinned into my ears. Someday, I
promised myself, I'll be doing so well I can afford to go back.</p>

<p>I was determined to make good, and deep inside myself was the
unshaken conviction that I would be a success someday. I was quite
willing to work for that success and to make sacrifices to attain it. I
did work, not forgetting Miss Conti's teaching, and striving all the
time to do better. Many of the girls I met in the companies in which I
played, or at the Cats' Home, admitted, frankly, that they were content
just to be good enough to get by. They, apparently, did not have that
insistent, not-to-be-ignored inner drive which forced me to practice
constantly and to learn more and always more about the theater.</p>

<p>I cannot take any credit to myself for this determination to
succeed, for it was inherent in my nature. I did have to battle through
periods of despair and frustration. But I am by nature hopeful. I do
not understand defeat. My own psychology in those years before I was
seventeen was quite simple: I believed, unquestionably, that I was
destined to be an actress. The fortune which the penny-in-the-slot
machine on the pier at Brighton had given me seemed to me to state this
quite unequivocally. I saw no reason to doubt the gypsy's prophecy. It
might be. this season&mdash;or the next&mdash;that I would emerge from
the obscurity of the chorus of a musical which played the provinces and
the cheaper suburbs of London. But emerge I would. Meanwhile it was up
to me to make myself as good as I could be. Each performance was a
fresh challenge.</p>

<p>One night after the show in Swindon there was a knock on the
chorus's dressing-room door. The callboy handed me a card which read
LEE WHITE AND CLAY SMITH, LONDON AND NEW YORK. I went out and found an
American couple on vacation from their London season. They were
visiting Swindon to see the cathedral and had dropped in at our
show.</p>

<p>They took me out to supper at their hotel and we talked.</p>

<p>"You're good," Lee said to me seriously. "You don't belong in a show
like this. You've got something. Clay and I are going to keep our eyes
on you." She made me promise to keep them informed of what towns we
played, and let them know whenever I changed shows. "You never can
tell," she finished; "we may learn of something. And, when we do,
you'll hear from us."</p>

<p>I rather doubted the validity of this promise, but from time to time
I would send them a picture post card to the address Lee gave me.</p>

<p>Nearly a year later, while I was playing in Yarmouth, I received a
telegram. It was signed <i>Lee White and Clay Smith</i>, and it said
tersely that they had recommended me for a job in a revue which
Andr&Atilde;&copy; Charlot was staging in London. <i>Can you come at
once?</i> the wire ended.</p>

<p>I was all for dashing to the station and leaping aboard the first
London Express, but the other girls, to whom I had shown the wire, held
me back.</p>

<p>"How do you know this is a genuine offer?" they demanded. "Suppose
you leave the show here and go flying up to London only to find the
manager has signed someone else? There you'll be&mdash;out of a job and
without a bean."</p>

<p>These suggestions sobered me. "What'll I do? I can't afford to throw
over a chance like this, can I? It's for London!"</p>

<p>The girls agreed wholeheartedly that this was not to be thought of.
We put our heads together and concocted a return message: <i>Does your
wire constitute a contract?</i> I ran down to the station and sent it
off; then I went back to the theater to dress for that night's show,
trying desperately to keep my mind on my cues and not on the
extravagant fancies that kept popping up when I thought of London.</p>

<p>When I came off stage after the final curtain, the stage doorman
handed me a telegram. I ripped it open. With the other girls crowding
around, peering over my shoulder, I read:</p>

<blockquote>YES, IF YOU CAN COME AT ONCE, THIS TELEGRAM CONSTITUTES A
CONTRACT. CLAY SMITH.</blockquote>

Luckily, I had no contract, but if I was to leave I had to do so
without the management getting wind of it. Back in our lodgings, my
roommate, Madge, and I took stock of our resources. It was a Tuesday
night&mdash;four days to payday. What money I had plus all that she
could afford to lend me wouldn't pay for a third-class ticket to
London. Neither of us owned anything of value that we could pawn. We
looked at each other, and for the first time in my life I felt
desperate. Here was my chance&mdash;a chance for a contract at a London
theater, and for the lack of a few shillings I couldn't seize it. Madge
said slowly:

<p>"I've got a friend in camp here. I'll get word to him. If he has any
money, he'll help us. And, if he hasn't, he'll know how to raise
it."</p>

<p>We didn't sleep much that night. I lay tense, staring into the dark.
Somehow, by some means or other, I must get the money for that ticket
to London. Next morning I was packed and ready to take off when Madge
went out to meet her boy friend. She came back in a short time,
bringing him with her. He was a little, bright-faced lad from Bristol.
Before he enlisted, he'd been a joiner's apprentice. Now he was
drilling with a regiment of gunners, getting ready to go over to
Flanders. Madge showed him the wire and drew a vivid picture of the
importance of this chance which had come my way. Bristol looked me over
with a speculative eye, as if I were a horse on which someone was
advising him to place his money. I tried to look as promising as
possible. If only he would think me worth betting on. Presently he
nodded. He had, he informed us, eight shillings, which he was prepared
to risk on me. My face fell. Even with his eight shillings added to our
resources, the ticket to London was a long way off. Madge explained
this to him.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Bristol complacently. "I've a couple of
mates who might be willing to take a flier."</p>

<p>We arranged to meet him and his friends at the railway station
within an hour. Madge and I were standing by the ticket office when
five British Tommies, with Bristol in the lead, bore down on us.</p>

<p>"There she is," said he, pointing at me. The other five looked me
over. Five heads nodded approbation.</p>

<p>Out of the uniform pockets came half crowns and shillings which the
Tommies handed over to Madge, my self-constituted financial manager.
She counted the money. "Hurray! Enough for a ticket, and fifteen
shillings over to see you through your first week in London," she said
triumphantly.</p>

<p>While she bought my ticket, I turned to Bristol and his five mates.
"Thank you, boys. You'll get your money back. And you won't be sorry
you've done this for me. I promise."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," one of the Tommies replied gallantly. "It's
always a pleasure to help a lady."</p>

<p>"I mean it," I said earnestly. "I won't forget what you've done for
me today. Not ever! And when I'm playing at His Majesty's Theatre in
the Haymarket, it'll be because you boys helped me get there."</p>

<p>The six Tommies saw me off on the London Express. I hung out of the
window and waved to them, and they all waved back to me.</p>

<p>"Best of luck, Gertie! Mind now, don't let us down."</p>

<br>


<p>The little revue in which Lee White and Clay Smith found a place for
me was one of the first of a long run of such shows staged by
Andr&Atilde;&copy; Charlot. The revue in which I made my first
appearance bore the innocuous title, <i>Some</i>. This was followed in
turn by <i>Cheep</i>, <i>Tabs</i>, and <i>Buzz-Buzz</i>. I did a toe
dance and a duet with Clay Smith, and was also in the chorus. Charlot
gave me a three-year contract at three pounds ten shillings a week the
first year, four pounds ten shillings the second, and six pounds ten
shillings the third. I was made.</p>

<p>The pattern of all these wartime revues was simplicity itself. They
were staged with a minimum of scenery and a maximum of taste, and they
were cast with star names. Charlot's revues caught on immediately with
the British public. Each of them had a long run, and when it closed, it
was almost immediately succeeded by another, cut to the same successful
pattern.</p>

<p>The masculine part of those revue audiences was almost entirely in
khaki. The girls with the young lieutenants in the Gunners and Sappers
wore gay evening frocks. The men themselves were home on leave from the
Western Front, and were desperately in need of getting the sights and
sounds of the battle fronts along the Somme out of their systems. They
wanted terribly to forget. They dined and danced and went on to the
play and then on to supper clubs, where they danced again and drank,
cramming their hours of leave with all the gaiety they could seize. It
was up to us in <i>Charlot's Revue</i> to offer these men gaiety. It
was up to us to bring laughs to boys whose youthful faces were set in
grim lines and whose eyes never quite lost the wounded look even when
their lips smiled. It was up to us to delude them into
believing&mdash;if only for one split second&mdash;that death and
destruction and terror and dirt and pain were unreal.</p>

<p>The boys adored Charlot's revues. You would look out into the house
and see a boy sitting in the same seat night after night. You would
smile at him across the footlights, establishing a comradeship. Then
one night, when you looked, there would be another boy in khaki or navy
blue sitting in that seat. The other had gone back, where and to what
you didn't know and didn't want to guess. Sometimes, after months,
suddenly there he would be again, waiting for you to make him laugh.
When he turned up like that, you felt better yourself and you'd think:
"He's all right. He's come through this time." It never occurred to
you, nor did it matter at all, that you didn't even know his name.</p>

<p>The London of June 1944 in which I had found myself on arriving from
America bore not the slightest resemblance to the London I remembered
during the years 1915 to 1918. The audiences one saw at the West End
theaters in the summer of 1944 were predominantly in uniform, but there
was a noticeable lack of girls in evening dress, and there was a
striking absence of the hectic
let-us-dance-and-be-merry-for-tomorrow-we-die gaiety, which was the
undercurrent of the life I remembered during World War I. The Londoners
of 1944 were quieter and more matter of fact, even about their
pleasures. They laughed at the jokes and the songs and the comedy skits
in the shows, but you felt no desperation in their amusement. You felt
that, not for one minute, though they laughed, did they forget the
immediacy of war and the menace to all that the British people hold
dear. One felt&mdash;at least I did&mdash;that between 1917 and 1944
the British people had lost their youth and regained their wisdom.</p>

<br>


<p>Bea Lillie was one of the stars of <i>Some</i>, and I was required
to understudy her as well as appear in the chorus. Bea and I quickly
became friends and partners in practical jokes which both of us adored
to play on others in the cast.</p>

<p>I remember the night in 1917 when America entered the war. Lee and
Clay had sat up all the night before writing a song especially for the
occasion, and had rehearsed it all day. The time came for Clay to step
out onto the stage and announce the new song. This done, the front tabs
were drawn, leaving room downstage for Lee to sing in a spotlight. Bea
and I and the rest of the company were standing back of the drop
curtains to hear the new song. It was a march entitled "America Answers
the Call."</p>

<p>As Lee sang, suddenly Bea started to march madly back and forth back
of the curtain just behind Lee. I joined her. The cast began to laugh,
and the more they laughed the more exaggerated our marching became. Our
arms waved until they moved the curtains. Finally Clay came down upon
us.</p>

<p>"My God," he whispered fiercely at Bea, "where do you think you
are?"</p>

<p>"The Ritz," she replied with her own inimitable gesture of the right
hand, and with that distinctive lift of the voice at the end of the
line.</p>

<p>There was a rehearsal call the next day. Although Bea and I lived at
opposite ends of London, by sheer coincidence we both arrived late. We
were both fired.</p>

<p>The star and her understudy went out to lunch together. I knew
Charlot would want to take Bea back, but I was worried about myself. I
had gone too far, and I had seriously offended Lee and Clay, who had
done so much for me.</p>

<p>Bea and I returned humbly to the theater and I sat in the wardrobe
mistress's room waiting to be sent for. Bea was forgiven, and I was
lectured severely and then&mdash;at Lee White's urgent
request&mdash;given another trial.</p>

<p>Anyone would think I would have learned something by this
experience, but apparently I did not. I was soon up to mischief
again.</p>

<p>In one of the revues Lee sang a song, "Have You Seen the Ducks Go
By?" At the end of the verse a row of obviously artificial ducks
appeared on a wall at the back of the stage and moved across it in time
to the music. The effect was made by us girls walking behind the wall,
with only our duck-like hats showing. That number was a hopeless
temptation to me. I couldn't help making my duck frisk about and behave
as no properly drilled duck would ever do. Nor could I resist popping
my head up over the wall in the wrong place, winking at the audience,
and laughing when they laughed at me. Naturally Lee did not like this
in the least. But Bea Lillie adored it and would join in with the
chorus and pop her head up&mdash;minus the duck headdress. Sometimes
she wore a man's straw hat and a false mustache. The audience would
howl with laughter, but it upset Lee. Finally Clay stopped speaking to
me.</p>

<p>I suppose a psychologist could find a reason for the irrepressible
impulse to play pranks which obsessed me for several seasons after I
got started on the London stage. They were the kind of pranks that
usually only school children think are funny&mdash;fake telegrams,
keyholes stuffed with soap, coat sleeves sewed up at the cuffs so that
the victim found it impossible to make a quick change of costume. If it
seems strange that I should have taken such liberties after I had been
at pains to get an opportunity in a London production, I can only
explain these idiosyncrasies of mine on the ground that I must have
been making up for those years when I had been working at a time when
most children my age were playing games. Perhaps it was just something
I had to get out of my system. Perhaps, too, it was the not abnormal
reaction of a girl who suddenly found herself made much of for the
first time in her life. On looking back it seems to me extraordinary
the patience which Andr&Atilde;&copy; Charlot had with me during those
seasons. I must have been an unmitigated nuisance&mdash;to him and to
all the other members of the company. What I needed was to have someone
tick me off. Ultimately, Andr&Atilde;&copy; Charlot did just that.</p>

<p>During the run of <i>Some</i> I kept more or less within bounds. I
was still the least important member of the cast. I had every intention
of pleasing Mr. Charlot so that he would give me a place in his next
revue. I was determined not to go back to touring companies.</p>

<p>I had repaid the loan to Bristol and his mates, who had gone off to
Flanders and from whom I received occasional field post cards&mdash;the
kind supplied to the soldiers&mdash;with such messages as: "I am well."
"I am ill." "All the best. "Write soon."</p>

<p>It may seem strange that I did not go out to Clapham to find Mother
and Dad and let them know that I was now playing in London. What held
me back from this was my own ambition. Whenever I was tempted to go
back to Mother, Dad, and Granny, it seemed as though something in me
would whisper: "Don't go yet. You're not somebody yet. Wait till you're
somebody."</p>

<p>I entertained myself imagining the home-coming scene. I would make a
royal progress through Clapham in an open taxi. When I arrived at
Mother's door there would be a flurry of excitement among the neighbors
and Gertrude Lawrence, now the star of the London stage, would descend
from her chariot to receive the congratulations of everybody.</p>

<p>Does this seem trivial and selfish? I do not attempt to justify it,
or any of the other impulses which made me think such thoughts or do
the things I did. Most of us, I believe, have or do still indulge in
some such fantasy as this which compensates for a lot of hard knocks
and heartaches. Very few among us are noble, or even mature, in all
parts of our nature at the same time.</p>

<p>So, though I daydreamed about it, I did not go back to Mother.
Mother, however, discovered me. One evening when I arrived at the
theater, to make up for the show, a woman was standing just inside the
stage door. The doorman whispered she was waiting for me. It was
Mother. We stood there in the drafty little passage, with people coming
and going and pushing past us, and stared at each other. Suddenly all
the years that had passed since the afternoon when I had suddenly
conceived the plan of running away and throwing in my lot with my own
father were swept away. I was once more a little girl who had done
something she knew her mother would not approve of and who had been
caught and was now wondering what was going to happen to her.</p>

<p>Actually, nothing happened. To my surprise, Mother took me in her
arms. To my question how she had found me, she replied that she had
been passing along the street when the air-raid warning sounded. She
had taken cover in a hotel next to our theater, and when the all clear
came she had stopped out of curiosity to see what was on at the
theater. She had noticed the name "Gertie Lawrence" among the
small-part people.</p>

<p>My dream of impressing the family was shattered, but at least I had
got my mother back, and I realized then how much I had missed her.
Granny, grown much older and quite feeble now, took particular personal
pride in my having a part in a successful West End production. Though
she never said so, I think Granny felt secretly responsible for having
started me on my career.</p>

<br>


<p>As I went from revue to revue, in each show I was given more to do.
This, of course, brought more prestige and, on my part, more
self-assurance. I still played pranks, and the more I played, the more
daring I became. Not unnaturally, Andr&Atilde;&copy; Charlot got a
little fed up with me. He said so more than once in no unvarnished
terms.</p>

<p>While I was playing in <i>Buzz-Buzz</i>, I came down with a bad
attack of lumbago. The doctor ordered me to bed. I was laid up for the
better part of a week. When Saturday night came, I was feeling much
better than I had felt for several days. The doctor said I would be
able to go back to work on Monday. That evening Ivor Novello rang me
up. He'd heard I had lumbago, and he wanted to know how I was getting
on.</p>

<p>"I'm better," I said. "In fact, I'm working again Monday."</p>

<p>"Wonderful, darling," came Ivor's voice over the wire.</p>

<p>"Ethel Baird is opening tonight in her new show, <i>Summer Time</i>.
Bobbie Andrews and I have got a box. A lot of us are going. Why not
come along, too, darling?"</p>

<p>"How can I?" I said.</p>

<p>"But you're much better, darling," Ivor suggested. "My dear girl, do
ask the doctor to let you come."</p>

<p>I began to get the idea. "Of course I could ring up my doctor and
ask him what he thinks," I wavered.</p>

<p>"Wonderful," Ivor approved. "He's sure to say it would do you no end
of good to get out of that stuffy room and have a bit of fun."</p>

<p>"I'll see what he says," I promised. "I'll ring up and ask him if he
thinks it would hurt me to go."</p>

<p>The doctor gave, as his opinion, that I would be no worse if I went
to the opening, provided I came straight home and went directly to bed.
"No staying out dancing all night," he commanded.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't think of it," I said hastily.</p>

<p>I promptly rang up Ivor and told him to come around and fetch
me.</p>

<p>The opening was a very smart one; everybody was there. It was
wonderful sitting in the stage box with Ivor, watching the celebrities
come in. I was sitting in the front of the box, not to miss a thing,
when who should come down the center aisle but Andr&Atilde;&copy;
Charlot and his wife. Before I could slither between Ivor and Bobbie
into obscurity behind them, Andr&Atilde;&copy; Charlot's eyes were
lifted and swept the stage boxes. I felt his gaze halt and fix itself
directly on my face. "That's done it," I thought. "He'll be furious, of
course."</p>

<p>When Monday evening came, I arrived at the stage door, as chipper as
you please. Old George, the doorman, looked at me reprovingly. He
blocked the doorway. "I'm sorry, miss," he said. "I've got my orders
not to let you in."</p>

<p>"Oh, come off it, George," I said.</p>

<p>Old George shook his head. "Sorry, miss, I've had my orders.
Straight from Mr. Charlot himself they came. You're not to be let in.
Not any more. You're fired."</p>

<p>"What about my part?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Jessie Matthews is going on for you, miss. She's making up now.
Here, I've got a note for you." He produced a sealed envelope and
handed it to me.</p>

<p>The note was from Andr&Atilde;&copy; Charlot himself. He made no
bones about it. He was firing me from <i>Buzz-Buzz</i>. I had been
absent more than six performances which, under the terms of my
contract, permitted him to cancel it and to engage someone else to take
my place. "If you are well enough to go to other people's plays, you
are well enough to come to your own," the note ended.</p>

<p>I tried to get him on the telephone, but he was not at his home, and
no one there would tell me where he was. Finally, after considerable
maneuvering, I located him at a hotel in the country and rang him
there. I simply couldn't believe that he would fire me for such a
little thing as staying out one night more than my illness made
necessary. Why, time and again he had forgiven me much worse offenses
than that. But now Charlot was offended and angry, and firm in his
determination to teach me a lesson. He gave me to understand in no
uncertain terms that he had had enough of my nonsense. "You've been
asking for this for a long time," he snapped. Then he hung up, leaving
me gasping.</p>

<p>There was no getting round it. I had been sacked. Already the story
was probably traveling like wildfire through the theaters of the West
End. I could just imagine how some of the wiser ones would smile over
the news that Gertrude Lawrence had been told off for being too smart.
"Played one trick too many, Gertie has."</p>

<p>It was barely a fortnight to Christmas, and I was out of a job.</p>

<br>


<p>From Camp Tanner on the estate of the Earl of Chichester our orders
were to proceed to Arundel, where a large R.A.F. center was located. On
the short drive we passed close to Bognor, with its memories of my
childhood holiday when I sang on the sands. Those sands were now
barricaded with barbed wire and the sea front was patrolled by guards
and protected by big guns.</p>

<p>That night our unit played for the group at Arundel. After the show
we visited the "Flare Path" and watched the Spitzes and Mosquitoes
coming in from their raids over France. These boys had actually played
a part in the great invasion. They had covered the armies swarming up
the beaches and fighting their way into the coast towns. And here they
were back again....</p>

<p>Two of the boys we talked to in the crew room, where the pilots
await their calls for briefing, had bagged Nazis that day. They were
quiet, modest young men, with bright, clear eyes and ready smiles.
Nothing nervy or high-strung about them that anyone could see.</p>

<p>Next day we motored along the south coast, one hundred miles to
Canterbury. All Sussex and Kent were a vast armed camp&mdash;a sealed
reservoir of men and munitions waiting to be ferried over to Normandy.
In most of the old churches in the villages we drove through were tombs
of Norman knights who had crossed the Channel with William the
Conqueror's invaders.</p>

<p>Canterbury was a shock. The town was badly bombed during the last
blitz, when Hitler seemed to have decided to go after all England's
cathedrals. But here again, as with St. Paul's, he missed. The
beautiful minster still stood, pathetically lovely in the midst of a
surrounding devastation. We did our show under canvas at Bridge Camp.
It was all very primitive, but the boys gave us a great hand and were
touchingly appreciative of our efforts to entertain them. These men
were Commandos and Rangers, boys from every state in the Union, who
yowled with delight when I sang them songs they recognized as American.
They, too, were awaiting orders to leave for Normandy at any hour.</p>

<p>From Canterbury back to London and a letdown from the high
excitement that prevailed all along the south coast. The excitement and
singing in the barn near Chichester had given me a sore throat. I
gargled sedulously, determined not to be laid up.</p>

<p>This time we headed north into Bedfordshire. The fat farms smiled at
us. British people have always loved the countryside, but now you felt
that that love was less romantic than formerly. You saw people actually
smacking their lips at the sight of rows of broad beans, or six
ducklings waddling in single file down a green bank to a pond.</p>

<br>


<p>We did our show in Bedford's city hall that night to an audience of
twenty-six hundred mixed troops. The mayor and mayoress were there and
there were speeches and photographs and flowers&mdash;really a
gala.</p>

<p>I got back late to The Swan, not feeling at all well. Fortunately we
had a quiet night&mdash;no air raids. We were all up early the next
morning to motor twenty-three miles back to Luton to put on a factory
show at "Electrolux." Luton, with its wonderful views of the Chilterns,
used to manufacture hats, both felt and straw. The straw was imported
from Japan and from Italy&mdash;one reason why the Luton workers are
not turning out straw boaters this season. Luton still makes its own
beer, and very good beer it is, especially after you've been singing
out of doors to a lunch-hour crowd.</p>

<p>We put on another show that night for the R.A.F. in a
non-operational base. The temperature in the hut was 102 degrees. I
went home after the show and to bed, where I stayed for the next four
days. I kept begging Mary Barrett to dose me and to cover up the fact
that I was ill. I went through anxious hours, hoping the press wouldn't
get hold of the story. If that had happened, it might have prevented me
from getting to the second front, as I had been promised.</p>

<p>From Bedford we drove more than two hundred miles back to the busy
south coast and the Southampton area. We found everyone there talking
about the new "pilotless planes" which were beginning to come over and
about which there had been rumors. There were three alerts during our
first night in Portsmouth. The south coast had always been a target for
the Luftwaffe, but the boys along that coast were watching for the
"doodlebugs," as the Americans called them. The things were proving
more deadly than had been expected. As they exploded on contact, or on
time, and without warning, it was almost impossible to find safety if
one were caught within distance of the blast. There were a lot of
casualties in and around Southampton and, we heard, in London. Our Red
Cross nurse at Drury Lane was killed by one of them.</p>

<p>For a week we did shows in tents, hangars, garrison theaters, and
under trees. Each time the men would be gone the next morning. It gave
one a sinking feeling to realize that these men were actually going
into battle with the song in their hearts they had heard you sing only
a few hours before. I had brought a new song with me when I came back
to the big Southampton area, "All's Well, Mademoiselle." It was written
for me on D-Day by Michael Carr and Tommy Connor. I had thousands of
copies printed, and as I sang it I handed out the autographed copies to
the boys and got them to sing it with me:</p>

<blockquote><i>[The quotation which follows of lines from the song has
been omitted from this ebook for reasons of

<p>My diary gives the story of my experience in London when the robots
began to rain down on the city:</p>

<p>...Sunday night. I am in bed at the Savoy. 10:00 P.M. Alert just
gone. Wonder if it's Hitler's dirty flying bugs again? The window in my
bedroom is broken from the blast concussion. But part of Cherbourg is
ours tonight; so who cares?...1:00 A.M. Three of the bloody things have
just fallen outside. You hear the beastly droning; then it stops; then
it explodes. The whole hotel shudders and my curtains blow into the
room from the blast.... 1:50 A.M. One more has just blazed over and
dropped with a terrific bang near by. The Strand seems to be the
popular target for tonight! Next door a couple are making love. <i>Here
comes another!</i> And now it's raining hard to make things harder for
the A.R.P. rescue workers. That couple must be fatalists. Wouldn't
Hitler be furious at their complete unconcern?... There's another. That
makes six around here up to now. And our Combined Air Forces are
supposed to have been hammering at the robot bases every day....
<i>Seven!</i> More rain. Quiet next door now. <i>Eight!</i> What a
night! Haven't heard a shot from our guns, but I don't see how they can
spot them. The projectiles just seem to come over like fireworks on the
fifth of November. <i>Nine!</i> It is now two-fifteen. Not much lull.
The krauts must be having a gleeful evening across the Channel. This
kind of warfare costs them no pilots. I wonder if Hitler has it all
arranged so that he can sit at home and push a button that fires the
wretched things? <i>Ten</i> and <i>eleven</i>. Two at once that time.
Now they are coming in pairs. It's no use trying to sleep in a tin hat,
and it looks pretty silly, especially when one is alone, so I shall
just have to sit up and record this my first real experience of being
blindly blitzed by robots....</p>

<p>It really is a strange and utterly helpless feeling&mdash;not one
sound of a plane of ours overhead, or any attempt at gunfire; just
these oncoming, droning, phantom missiles loaded with destruction. My
room is on a small courtyard, so I can see nothing, but the explosions
have been very violent. Much damage must be being done. Being Sunday,
and this a business section, there may not be many casualties, but the
property loss will be great. It is now 2:45 A.M. It gets light around
5:00 A.M. Soon I can open my curtains and get some fresh air. Not that
the daylight stops the "doodlebugs."</p>

<p>I was just going to write "guess it's all over for tonight," but
here comes Charlie again, making a round dozen since one o'clock. The
alert has been on since ten&mdash;five hours steady. I'm getting very
sleepy.... Here's another one coming&mdash;thirteen. I admit I got out
of and under the bed that time. It was too close to be comfortable, and
I don't like odd numbers. But it passed right overhead and
<i>crumped</i> down farther away. Golly! That seemed like "this is it"
for a while.</p>

<p>3:45 A.M. Maybe I should put down the date&mdash;Monday, June 26.
Sixteen and seventeen have just landed right outside. I can hear the
A.R.P. at work. Those last two were volcanic. How many more? I suppose
this is reprisal for Cherbourg.</p>

<p>Four o'clock just chimed, and number eighteen has come down with an
awful bump. It must have hit a power station or something. This is
truly a nightmare. The air is full of sudden death, coming at us from
all sides, without cessation. I haven't the nerve to take this kind of
bombing, especially when I'm alone. I get to thinking...thinking...</p>

<br>


<p>Lying awake in the ghostly half-light alone, listening for the drone
of the buzz bombs as they came over, holding myself tense through the
moment of agonizing suspense, waiting for the crash of their landing, I
found myself living through the air raid that rocked London the night
my daughter Pamela was born.</p>

<br>

<h2 id="chapter8">8</h2>

<br>


<p>When Andr&Atilde;&copy; Charlot canceled my contract with him, I
immediately went over to the London Hippodrome to see if I could get a
part in the Christmas production, which was due to open there in a few
days. But I was told there was nothing for me. A few more inquiries
made it clear to me that it wasn't going to be easy to land a job
immediately. The news had gone round that I was impossible to
manage.</p>

<p>I needed to get to work right away. I had very little money saved
up, barely enough to keep me if I remained out of work for more than a
fortnight. I have never been thrifty. Goodness knows I wish I were.
From the day I began to work and to earn money, I've always spent what
I earned. I don't think it ever occurred to me that I would be out of
work and unable to earn a living. So, as the money came in, it went
out&mdash;for myself and for others, and for things that seemed to me
necessary, or interesting, or worth while.</p>

<p>Though there were no openings at the theaters, I thought I might
have some success as an entertainer at Murray's Club. Murray's was
London's first night club. It had just been started, and it was drawing
big crowds, especially the young officers on leave. I went round to see
the manager and was auditioned. He engaged me to start at once. He was
glad to get a youngster from <i>Charlot's Revue</i> who might be
expected to draw trade. There I directed and put on the first floor
show in a London night club.</p>

<p>At the same time I understudied Phyllis Dare in the Hippodrome
pantomime.</p>

<p>Murray's was a gay spot in wartime London. It was the smart place to
go for supper and dancing, a place where the music and the girls and
the wine and the cabaret helped people forget the heartbreaking defeat
at Kut-el-Amara and the blow to British prestige.</p>

<p>It was one of the tensest periods of the war. Everyone felt it.
Everyone was edgy, nervous, overtired, and desperately determined to
keep up a front at any cost, so the theater flourished. One night
Andr&Atilde;&copy; Charlot appeared at Murray's and asked me to join
him at his table. He said he wanted to make up, and I was as glad about
this as he obviously was. I wanted us to be friends, and I
wanted&mdash;and said so frankly&mdash;to get a place in his next
revue. But, alas, there was nothing for me in it. I've often wondered
if Charlot wasn't just being canny; whether he wasn't determined to
find out, before he re-engaged me, whether I really had settled down
and could be trusted to behave myself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I got together a double act with Walter Williams, who had
been in some of Charlot's revues. We opened at the London Coliseum and
toured the circuit of the Moss Empire theaters which were scattered
through the key cities. The act was an enormous success. We used
numbers from old Charlot's revues, and as we were billed "straight from
London," we always topped every bill. I danced, and Walter's big hit
song was "K-K-Katie."</p>

<p>(Poor Walter was killed by a direct-bomb hit during the London blitz
three years ago. When he went I lost a great friend who helped me when
I needed it.)</p>

<p>At that time my own personal life was occupying more and more of my
attention. I was engaged to a boy who was serving in the balloon
barrage which floated over London. Whenever I would look up and see the
big balloons bobbing lazily above the roofs and spires, like bubbles
rising in an enormous glass of champagne, I had a cozy feeling of
protection. My boy was up there looking out for me and for our city. He
had taken me to meet his parents; he'd given me a ring&mdash;a sapphire
surrounded by little diamonds&mdash;which I adored and wore proudly.
Someday, when the war was over, we'd get married. Meanwhile, we were
together whenever his hours permitted it. He'd turn up at Murray's, or
I'd come off the stage at one of the London music halls where Walter
Williams and I were playing, and there would be Peter sitting in the
dressing room, waiting for me.</p>

<p>Then all at once something happened&mdash;I met Frank Howley. He was
twenty years my senior and I was immensely flattered by his attention.
Moreover, he belonged to my world&mdash;the world of the theater. He
spoke my language&mdash;that of the theater. He was a director, and he
talked to me of his future plans in which I figured as his star.</p>

<p>When I went out with Peter, he was not interested in hearing me talk
about the theater. He didn't take the theater seriously, and he
couldn't understand why I did. His plan for us was to get married and
for me to leave the profession at once in order to turn myself into the
conventional type of young wife&mdash;the kind of wife his people would
approve of for him. The more I thought of it, the surer I became that
this was no part that I would ever star in. I could play a lot of
roles, but not that of young Mrs. Peter.</p>

<p>Frank had no family problem. His brothers approved of me, though
they exclaimed with surprise on meeting me: "My God, Frank, she doesn't
wear any make-up!"</p>

<p>The more I thought about Peter and the life he pictured to me, and
to which he, apparently, looked forward as though it was the most
wonderful existence in the world, the more certain I became that it was
not the life for me. So I broke our engagement. Peter took it hard, but
gallantly. He was a romantic, and he refused to let me give him back
his ring. "Keep it," he said, "and wear it to remember me by. I shall
remember you always."</p>

<p>Frank and I were married&mdash;quietly and without interrupting my
work. Mother disapproved, but there was nothing she could do about it,
as I was economically independent. She thought Frank was too old for
me, and she reminded me of her own unfortunate marriage with my father,
who was also in the profession.</p>

<p>There's no doubt Mother would have liked me to have been young Mrs.
Peter. It would have justified all her efforts to bring me up like a
lady. Granny, however, had had her misgivings about my engagement to
Peter from the start. Granny liked people who knew what world they
belonged to, and who stayed inside that world. "You may not be wealthy
with Frank," she said to me quietly, "but money isn't everything. It
isn't the most important thing in life. Not nearly so important as
doing what you feel you have to do as well as you're able to do
it."</p>

<p>We went to live in Maida Vale. We had a flat, and Frank's two
brothers stayed with us whenever they were in London. Frank began
looking around for financial backing to start a company of his own.
Meanwhile, I went on with my theater work, doing my job as a housewife,
and understudying Bea Lillie, whom Charlot was featuring in the current
show. I was terribly grateful to Charlot for taking me on again, and I
kept hoping he would find a real place for me in one of the revues
before long. I didn't wish Bea any bad luck, but I couldn't help
longing for a chance to show Charlot&mdash;and the audience&mdash;what
I could do. In that ambition, and in the fantasies that I built up
around it, I suppose I was just like every other understudy in the
world.</p>

<p>Then I learned I was going to have a child. I was excited and
thrilled.</p>

<p>"You should give up your work," the doctor advised.</p>

<p>"How can I?" I shrugged my shoulders. I couldn't explain that my
husband was not earning anything at the time.</p>

<p>The doctor frowned. "It is usually possible to do whatever it is
necessary to do," he said. "At least I have found this to be true."</p>

<p>"Oh, I agree with you," I told him.</p>

<p>If my own experience had taught me anything, it was that, if a thing
had to be done, it could be done. Of course it would be wonderful to be
so well off you could coddle yourself. But then I had never been in
that state of financial ease. Doctors, I told myself, were always
telling you to rest and relax and not to worry. They gave you that sort
of advice spontaneously and freely. It was part of the formula. They
must know that an actress couldn't possibly stop working for months
simply because she was going to have a baby. I had known dozens of
girls who had gone on working until just before their babies were born.
I compromised by promising myself that I would work as long as I could;
then I would stay home and obey the doctor's orders.</p>

<p>Meantime, I had a great deal to keep me occupied. The flat took a
lot of attention. We couldn't afford a servant, not even a daily. I did
all the cooking, and, in addition, I made my baby's
clothes&mdash;sewing them by hand with all the dainty stitches Granny
had taken such pains to teach me. There was no money to waste, but I
wanted my baby to have the best I could give it. I bought a wicker
clothes-basket and lined it with padding and covered it with pink silk
to make a bassinet, like the expensive ones I had seen in the shops in
Regent Street.</p>

<p>One evening, when it came time to start for the theater, I felt very
ill. I said to myself, "I can't possibly go to work tonight." As
general understudy I was under contract to report at the theater for
every performance in case I was needed.</p>

<p>Then I thought, "I'll have to call up the theater. That means I've
got to go out to the corner to the telephone. By the time I've dressed
and done that, I might as well hop a bus and go there, report, and come
home again."</p>

<p>It was late when I arrived, which was unusual for me. I should have
checked in at seven-thirty, but it was ten minutes of eight when I
turned into the alley which led to the stage door. There was the stage
manager, walking up and down, muttering and fuming. There was the
callboy, running this way and that. Several heads stuck out of
dressing-room windows. Then the stage manager caught sight of me.</p>

<p>"For God's sake!" he yelled. "Come on! Where the hell have you
been?"</p>

<p>I started to tell him I was ill, but he paid no attention. Instead,
he caught hold of my elbow, hurried me up the steps and in through the
stage door.</p>

<p>"Lillie's off," he shouted. "Went riding in Hyde Park, and the horse
threw her. Concussion, they say she's got. You've got to go on. We're
holding the curtain for you. Buck up, my girl. Here's your chance.
Remember we're counting on you."</p>

<p>My chance&mdash;the chance I'd longed for for years. The chance
every understudy dreams about&mdash;the star suddenly ill, or meeting
with an accident, and the little understudy having to step in and take
her place. Now this had happened to me. As I stood there in Bea's
dressing room and her dresser helped me with swift, experienced
fingers, I thought, "The irony of it. It has happened to me just now
when I am feeling ill." The dresser looked at me encouragingly.</p>

<p>"You'll be all right, miss."</p>

<p>In a couple of songs Bea was doing male impersonations. For these
she wore a white tie and tails. The black broadcloth suit was cut
perfectly and fitted her slim, straight body like a glove. I held my
breath while the dresser laced me up tightly; then I got into the
trousers and white waistcoat. I stood before the long mirror and looked
at myself critically. Yes, I would do.</p>

<p>When my call came, I went on, and for the first time in my life on
the stage I knew anxiety. Bea was a tremendous favorite. Most of the
audience had come on purpose to see her. Could I satisfy them? If I
could hold that audience, if I could make them laugh and applaud and
like Gertrude Lawrence, then the rest of my career was assured. If I
failed, well&mdash;&mdash;My cue came and I went on.</p>

<p>Standing in the wings, watching with a worried look on his face, was
Andr&Atilde;&copy; Charlot. I flashed him a smile. At eleven-thirty,
after the final curtain, Andr&Atilde;&copy; Charlot kissed me on both
cheeks and said: "Well done, Gertie."</p>

<p>That night, and for many nights thereafter, I sang and danced and
tossed my lines across the footlights with all the gaiety at my
command. I was no longer anxious&mdash;that first night had proved to
me that I could hold the audience. I could make them laugh, applaud,
and cheer, and come back for more. I was doing it. I had succeeded. The
worried look was gone from Charlot's face.</p>

<p>The fall from her horse had injured Bea Lillie so badly that she had
to be out of the show for several months. This meant that Charlot would
have to engage another star to replace her&mdash;a big
name&mdash;unless I, the understudy, could take the place and hold the
public. If I could, then my reputation and prestige were made.</p>

<p>Night after night I bit my lips while the dresser laced me so
tightly it was hard to get breath enough to sing. Each night, when I
came off the stage, Frank would be there, waiting. There came a night
when I was very ill and Frank found a taxi for us. I sank into the
corner of the seat and folded my arms around myself tightly, trying to
stop the pain. Frank was arguing with the driver, who, as usual in
wartime, objected to going so far. He offered him five shillings extra,
and grudgingly the man agreed to take us. Frank got in beside me and
put his arms around my waist. His tenderness was a comfort, and the
warm pressure of his hands eased the pain. Suddenly the electric light
in the back of the cab was switched on; the driver drew up and swung
around in his seat. "Now then, none of that, you two," he growled. "Not
in my cab you don't."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Frank demanded.</p>

<p>"Never mind what's the matter," said the driver. "You know all
right. I seen ya in the mirror, I did."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Frank, his voice steely. "This lady happens to be my
wife."</p>

<p>"Coo," said the driver. "Lady, my word! I've heard that tale before.
Get on with you now, get out of my cab."</p>

<p>"We're not getting out. You've agreed to take us to Maida Vale, and
that is what you are going to do. I've told you, this lady is my wife.
She's going to have a baby, and I've got to get her home as fast as you
can make it."</p>

<p>The driver shot a questioning look at me. I nodded. "If you don't
get me there soon," I said, "I'm afraid I shall faint."</p>

<p>The driver switched off the light, stepped on the accelerator, and
the cab shot out of the Edgeware Road with a jolt that nearly landed me
on the floor. I gasped out loud. "My God, Missus, don't have it in my
cab," the cabby yelled.</p>

<br>


<p>The air raids on London were increasing. There was a battery of
anti-aircraft guns in the court outside our windows. The noise they
made prevented anyone from sleeping, and there was always the danger of
shrapnel from our own shells as well as from the German bombs. I began
to get jumpy, especially after a piece of shrapnel came sailing into
our room one night and embedded itself in the wall.</p>

<p>One day Frank told me he had got word of something in Liverpool that
might be good. At least, it sounded promising. He went off to look it
over. His two brothers were staying with us in Maida Vale, but both of
them were down with influenza. I went to the theater that night as
usual. I did not feel at all well, but some of that I laid to the fact
that I had had a lot to do in the house that day, getting Frank off and
nursing his two brothers. My urge was to clean everything. I took down
the curtains from the windows, washed them, and hung them up again,
wet. I went over all the things I had prepared for the baby. For
several nights past I had not slept well, as the Zeps had been coming
over. I felt so faint while I was dressing, the dresser became alarmed.
She brought me out a stiff drink of brandy, and insisted that I take it
just before going on. The brandy warmed me and keyed up my spirits. I
gave one of my best performances. I knew it was my last night because
Bea was returning the following Monday. The house kept applauding and
calling me back for an encore. Twice&mdash;three times I went back. I
could see the stage manager standing in the wings, smiling broadly.
When I got back to the dressing room to change, and the excitement
began to wear off, I felt very ill indeed.</p>

<p>"It's good it's a Saturday night," the dresser said. "You can go
home and rest all day tomorrow and Monday."</p>

<p>"That's true," I said gratefully.</p>

<p>When I left the theater, the street was dark and quiet. I stood
there, wishing a taxi would come by, but none came. Every minute I felt
worse and worse. The thought of going out to Maida Vale, going in a bus
if no taxi was to be found, was more than I could endure. I thought,
"I'd better go home to Mother. She'll look out for me until Frank gets
back from Liverpool." A bus came by, going toward Piccadilly, and I
hopped aboard. I would have to change at Piccadilly Circus for Clapham.
I got out there and joined the crowd at the curb, praying I wouldn't
have to wait long. Minutes passed. Busses for Richmond and Shepherd's
Bush and Peckham, busses for the Elephant and Castle, busses for
Hounslow and Ealing and Wormwood Scrubs came lumbering down on us,
stopped to let off and take on passengers, and went lumbering on again.
Every minute I waited increased the agony of physical pain and terror.
The bobby kept looking at me anxiously.</p>

<p>"Where do you want to go, miss?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Clapham." Then I added, "I'm ill. I'm going to have a baby."</p>

<p>"Then you shouldn't go there by bus," said the bobby
practically.</p>

<p>"I know," I said, "but the taxis don't want to go so far."</p>

<p>The law blew its whistle. A cruising taxi came obediently to the
curb. The bobby opened the door and helped me in. He gave the driver
the address, and then out of respect to a lady's feelings he whispered
something, confidentially, in the driver's ear.</p>

<p>We started, and the man spoke over his shoulder to me: "I'll get you
there, lady. I'm a married man myself."</p>

<p>Mother was home when I got there, and Dad let me in. Mother took one
look at me, and not waiting for me to say anything, she called Dad to
make haste and hold the taxi. "You'll go right to the nursing home,"
she said to me, "tonight."</p>

<p>"But," I objected, "the baby isn't due for nearly two months."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Mother; "you can't tell a thing about a first
baby." She bustled me out and into the taxi again and on to a nursing
home, where I was immediately put to bed.</p>

<p>That night, and through the next, the Germans treated London to one
of the worst air raids of the war. On Monday night, while the raid was
at its height, my daughter was born. The sound she heard on coming into
this world was the crash of bombs. All her life she has loathed the
sound of planes.</p>

<p>No one, apparently, had thought to notify Andr&Atilde;&copy; Charlot
that I was in a nursing home. On Sunday and Monday I had been much too
ill to think of anything. On Tuesday morning I received a card from the
stage manager to remind Miss Lawrence that a rehearsal had been called
for Monday, at which she had failed to appear. The doctor sent a letter
in reply, saying that Miss Lawrence was otherwise engaged on
Monday!</p>

<p>On Tuesday Frank came to see me, bringing a bunch of poppies. Of
course he was pleased about the baby, but he was terribly worried too.
He sat by my bed, looking very downcast. The prospect in Liverpool had
turned out to be another disappointment.</p>

<p>"How long will you have to stay here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Ten days," I told him. The doctor had said, "Three weeks," but I
knew I must get back to work before that.</p>

<p>Frank's face grew longer. He hadn't a bean, and we were behind with
the rent. His brothers were still laid up, and they had no money
either. "I don't know which way to turn," he said.</p>

<p>I was unable to suggest anything. All I wanted was to be allowed to
stay there in that cool, clean bed&mdash;and rest. I was so tired. My
hands, lying on the coverlet, seemed too heavy to lift. On the left
hand, next to my wedding ring, was the sapphire ring Peter had given
me. Silently I drew it off and held it out to my husband. There was no
need to say anything. Frank dropped the sapphire into his waistcoat
pocket and the anxiety lifted from his face. He bent, kissed my cheek,
and went away.</p>

<p>I never saw Peter's ring again.</p>

<br>


<p>We named the baby Pamela. It was a beautiful, romantic name. She was
to have two others&mdash;Barbara after her father's sister who was a
nun, and May because she had arrived in that proverbially merry
month.</p>

<p>Just then the name Pamela did not seem at all suitable for the tiny
bluish little scrap of humanity which I held to my breast so
proudly.</p>

<p>Premature babies, I was informed, were difficult to rear. They had
to have special care, special food, and constant surveillance. Dr.
Ambrose said bluntly that the reason Pamela was a seven-months baby was
because I had worked so hard, coupled with the strain of the air
raids.</p>

<p>During the fortnight I was in the nursing home I had time to take
stock of a great many things. First, my responsibility toward my child.
Pam required expert, expensive care, and this meant I would have to get
back to work as soon as possible. I had brought her into the world; she
belonged to me as no one and nothing else in my life ever had belonged.
I would fight to keep her alive and to help her grow up strong and
beautiful.</p>

<p>Andr&Atilde;&copy; and Madame Charlot were real friends. Though they
never mentioned it, they were aware of my predicament. Charlot let me
go back to work as understudy, and I had reason to believe he meant to
give me a real part of my own in the new show. I was still pretty weak,
naturally, but overjoyed at the slim silhouette the mirror now
presented.</p>

<p>To meet the new expenses connected with Pamela, the flat in Maida
Vale would have to be given up. We could live with Mother and Dad for a
time and the baby could stay in the nursing home. This, I thought,
would set Frank's mind at rest, and he would be free to take on the
direction of companies on tour.</p>

<p>By the time I was ready to leave the nursing home I had it all
worked out, but Frank objected. Therefore I left the nursing home with
Pamela, returned to the flat, and tried for several weeks to carry on.
I bathed, fed, and walked the baby until midday. Then Mother would come
over and take care of the baby while I went to work. After a while it
became obvious we couldn't continue in this way, so we gave up the flat
and went to live with Mother and Dad. Her dining room on the ground
floor was turned into a bedroom for us. After a few more weeks we
decided to put the baby back in the nursing home, where she would get
expert care. I went on with my work with an easier mind.</p>

<p>On my free days I would go to the nursing home to visit Pamela. The
matron didn't encourage visitors. The home was understaffed, owing to
the war, and the nurses were overworked. That was the year of the
influenza epidemic, and visitors in hospitals and nursing homes, who
might carry the infection to patients, were not encouraged. Either
Mother or I called around at the nursing home to inquire about the baby
every few days. Between those times we satisfied our curiosity by means
of telephone calls.</p>

<p>Frank had not been successful in finding something he wanted to do.
Finally the break came.</p>

<p>"It's no good going on like this," he said. "We're not getting
anywhere."</p>

<p>I could see he was hurt, but I had all I could do just then to take
care of myself and to pay the bills for Pamela at the nursing home.
Frank finally left. He said we wouldn't hear from him again in a hurry.
A few days later I caught the flu and didn't dare visit my baby.</p>

<p>It was several days later that Mother went round in my behalf to the
nursing home to pay the bill and to inquire about Pam's progress.</p>

<p>"The baby's not here," the matron said.</p>

<p>"Not here?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. You didn't expect to find her here, did you?"</p>

<p>"What's become of her?" Mother demanded.</p>

<p>"The child's father came the day before yesterday and took her
away."</p>

<p>Mother hurried back to the house to tell me what the matron had
said.</p>

<p>"It can't be true!" I objected. "I'm paying for the baby's care. How
could Frank&mdash;or anyone&mdash;take her away?"</p>

<p>I got up out of bed and Mother and I went to see the matron. "Where
did he take the baby?" I demanded.</p>

<p>She told me briskly: "To Liverpool. I understand the child's
father's parents live there."</p>

<p>Somehow I felt Frank wouldn't do a thing like that. The matron was
very short with me&mdash;suspiciously so. When I demanded more definite
information, she finally confessed that the baby was still in the home,
but she was under strict orders from the child's father not to allow me
to see her.</p>

<p>When there was nothing to be done with the matron, I went to the
police station. There I was told that, under the law, a father could
exercise complete jurisdiction over his child. The fact that I had paid
the bills at the nursing home did not alter the law. However, the court
granted me permission to see my child. Mother and I returned to the
nursing home and brandished the court order in the face of the matron
and I demanded my rights. She was a tall, bony, equine woman, and she
obviously found us a great nuisance. She said stonily: "That baby is no
longer here."</p>

<p>"You told me that before," I reminded her. "Later, you said the
child was here. Surely you don't expect me to believe you now."</p>

<p>"No," she said justly. "I can quite see why you wouldn't, but you
can come with me and see for yourself."</p>

<p>We went through the nursery but there was no sign of Pamela.</p>

<p>I went back to the police station. Surely, I said, something could
be done to help me find my child, but again I was brought face to face
with the British law, which has its roots in the patriarchal
age&mdash;because Frank was Pamela's father, he was legally allowed to
dispose of her as he wished without consulting me.</p>

<p>I went posthaste to the lodgings where I thought Frank had been
living since we broke up. He was no longer there. Both his brothers
were away on tour. I wrote Frank in care of his mother, the only
address I knew where he might be reached. There was no answer to my
letter.</p>

<p>Weeks passed. No word from Frank. I went through my routine at the
theater night after night like a robot.</p>

<p>Each day I told myself that there would surely be a message from
Frank before that night. But none came. Every evening when I went to
the theater I fortified myself with the thought that when I came off
the stage at the end of the performance I would find Frank waiting for
me in my dressing room as he used to wait in the old days.</p>

<p>Then one afternoon when I came off stage old George was waiting for
me with a telegram. I read it in a glance:</p>

<blockquote>CHILD DESPERATELY ILL NEEDS YOU MEET ME USUAL PLACE
FRANK.</blockquote>

<p>I knew he meant Lyons' Corner House in Piccadilly, where he and I
used to meet and in which we had planned our wedding.</p>

<p>I tossed out the contents of my purse and counted the money. It
amounted to very little. I knew the pawnshop which was situated
conveniently close to the stage door would still be open. We girls
often took our trinkets there and thus raised a little much-needed
cash.</p>

<p>I laid a chain purse and my watch on the counter and asked the man
what he would let me have on them. There was no need for him to inspect
the pieces; he knew them well. They had been in and out of his vault
times without number. He automatically counted out thirty
shillings.</p>

<p>It was all he usually allowed on the things, but in this case it was
not enough for my purposes. If Pamela were desperately ill, as the wire
stated, she would need doctors, a nurse, special medicines. All those
things spelled money. I would need more than thirty shillings.</p>

<p>"Can't you give me more on them just this once?" I pleaded.</p>

<p>He shook his head at me. "You know better than that, young
lady."</p>

<p>"But I need the money desperately. Thirty shillings isn't enough.
I've got to have a fiver at least. Come on, be a sport."</p>

<p>Without a word he slid the things back across the counter.</p>

<p>"You mean you won't?"</p>

<p>"Not me," he said. Then, unable to resist the impulse to scold those
who have committed the sin of being in need of money, he said severely,
"I've got ter teach you girls a lesson, I 'ave. The management pays
you, don't it? Of course it do. What does a girl like you do with her
money? Throws it around. You'd ought to be ashamed of yourself, you
ought. You'd ought to have a tidy little sum put by in the savings
bank, and not come round expecting me to give you fancy prices on stuff
that's not worth the half of it."</p>

<p>He was working himself up into a fine state of righteous
indignation. Meanwhile time was passing. And I had to have the
money.</p>

<p>I laid my little bits of jewelry back on the counter and put my
problem to him unashamedly.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I do with my money," I said. "I have a baby.
She's only a few months old. She's ill. Desperately ill. If you don't
believe me, here's the wire from my husband to prove it."</p>

<p>I pulled the crumpled telegram out of my pocket and held it out to
him. "Go on, read it."</p>

<p>Deliberately he adjusted his spectacles and read Frank's
message.</p>

<p>"I've got to go to her, don't you see. I've got to have the money.
That's why I've come to you."</p>

<p>Without a word he turned and unlocked his money drawer. He took out
five dirty pound notes and put them in my hand. Then he gathered up the
jewelry and handed it over.</p>

<p>I started to thank him, but he cut me off.</p>

<p>"Take this stuff along with you. You can pay me back later."</p>

<br>


<p>It was a white-faced, thoroughly frightened Frank who rose from the
table to meet me when I arrived at the tea-shop. Neither of us spoke
for a while. There was too much to say. Finally I asked, "Where's my
baby, Frank? Where is she?"</p>

<p>He replied, "She's still in the nursing home. She's been there all
the time."</p>

<p>I stared at him, unable to believe my ears. He then confessed that
he had hoped, by taking the child, to bring me back to him. Now he had
found out that he could not keep up the payments in the nursing home.
Also the baby was ailing and he had promised the matron to send for
me.</p>

<p>Once again, and for the last time, he put it up to me:</p>

<p>"If you can lend me some money, I can go away and open an academy in
the Midlands," he said. "And I won't trouble you and Pamela any
more."</p>

<p>I gave him all I had&mdash;the contents of my purse. And then our
life together ended in the same spot where we had planned our
marriage.</p>

<p>Truly, a marvelous play could be written after the pattern of
<i>Grand Hotel</i>, about the characters one finds in the hostels on
the south coast of England during these days of war. Members of all the
services come in at all times and in all sorts of dress. Many of them
are straight from the invasion front. Tired, dirty, hungry, thirsty,
the men line up at the desk, asking for beds and baths. The invariable
reply is: "Sorry. No rooms."</p>

<p>But though there are no rooms, and never a sufficient number of beds
for the war weary, by some sort of juggling process that borders on the
miraculous places are made for the newcomers. War has turned the old
Box and Cox situation, which was the basis of so many farces, into an
everyday reality. One man drags himself, yawning, out of bed to make
place for another whose only claim is that he is, if possible, even
wearier than the earlier comer.</p>

<p>The bar opens at twelve noon. By one-thirty the stock on the shelves
is completely sold out. And still the men keep coming, pathetically
hopeful of rest and refreshment. The hotel lobby is strewn with duffel
bags and other gear, which everyone stumbles over. The swing doors
revolve ceaselessly.</p>

<p>At all hours of the day and night a queue waits with varying degrees
of patience before the door marked <i>Bath</i>. Standing in line,
waiting my turn at the tub, I thought: It's like the Cats' Home. We
girls used to queue up like this before the one bath to a floor. How
often I've stood on the cold, linoleum-covered passage, warming one
foot against the other, and sighed: "Shall I ever be rich enough to
have a bath of my own?"</p>

<p>It was good to get back to work after being laid up with a froggy
throat, and thrilling to be back in the south coast area, which was now
part of the second front. One morning I was told that arrangements had
been made for us to go out to H.M.S. <i>Tyns</i>. The admiral's barge
was sent to fetch us and we gave our first show at sea. Three hundred
and fifty jolly jack-tars and their officers crammed the little
theater-chapel-lecture cabin.</p>

<p>Motoring back to London, one saw evidences on all sides of the
destruction wrought by the robot planes. The crowded districts of
London were again hard hit. We passed squares in which all the little
houses and shops were ruined. Though the bombs had fallen hours
earlier, they were still carrying the dead from the ruins. But what
broke my heart were the little homes, roofless, and exposed to the
elements. It had been raining for forty-eight hours. Somehow there was
something cruelly indecent about the exposure of those rooms with their
pathetic furnishings. You knew that each of these wrecked homes had
cost its owner all his life and his savings to acquire.</p>

<p>In the bombed-out districts neighbors were helping each other,
sharing the misfortune, the anxiety, and the tragedy of death. The
robots had broken the reserve which has always been a characteristic of
British life. "Keep yourself to yourself," Mother used to say.</p>

<p>It is one more evidence of the enormity of the disaster which London
has undergone in this war that these people of Clapham and Wandsworth
and Tooting no longer keep themselves to themselves. Everyone's
misfortune now is shared by everyone.</p>

<p>Though the rain poured pitilessly, children dug in the rubble
seeking clothing and toys. One man, after working for hours, had just
found his dog buried under a heap of timbers. The poor creature was
terribly injured. The man mercifully wrung its neck while he cursed the
Nazis.</p>

<p>I put in another sleepless night at the Savoy. The alert sounded at
1:00 A.M., and the bombs came over with clock-like precision every few
minutes, until noon. Bush House was hit, and other buildings in the
Strand. Still the rain kept up.</p>

<p>It was still pouring when our unit left London at two in the
afternoon, headed for Leeds and then for Catterick Camp, the great
military center in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>When I woke next morning in the Queen's Hotel in Leeds, the sun was
shining. I felt happy as a lizard when he comes out of a clammy crack
in a wall and feels the sun's warmth on his body.</p>

<p>Mary Barrett tapped on my door and called: "Happy birthday!" I had
quite forgotten.</p>

<p>It was July Fourth, my birthday and the birthday of the American
nation. It was also the anniversary of my marriage to Richard. All day
I looked and hoped for some message from him. There were cables from my
daughter Pamela and from many friends in America. Also a letter from
Jack Potter, manager of <i>Lady in the Dark</i>. But none from Richard.
I knew what that meant&mdash;he was at sea. But I also knew, wherever
he was, and whatever his duties, he was remembering the day and keeping
it in his heart. As I was.</p>

<p>Poor Richard, I thought. He hasn't had much of a marriage with me up
to now. We had only a short time together before Pearl Harbor. Since
that day the war has occupied him. We have been like thousands of other
couples, living on letters, building all our plans on the words: "after
the war."</p>

<p>Mary gave me my first birthday present that day&mdash;a silver
five-shilling piece, very rare. The news leaked out that it was my
birthday, and some of the men serenaded me and gave me flowers. There
was one red, white, and blue bouquet which reminded me of the floral
American flag which Archie Selwyn sent me on the Fourth of July before
I made my first trip to America.</p>

<p>At Catterick I ran into Major Peter Mather, who was Helen Hayes's
touring manager in <i>Victoria Regina</i>. He was eager to talk and ask
about America and his friends there&mdash;Gilbert and Kitty Miller,
Ruth Gordon, and a lot more. We discussed the great amount of good
Helen had done for England by touring America with <i>Victoria
Regina</i>. There is no doubt that an honest, well-conceived play,
which really represents the psychology of a nation, does more to reveal
the spirit of that nation to the people of other countries than all the
painfully and artfully built-up propaganda put out by government
bureaus. The American audiences who saw <i>Victoria Regina</i> were in
a much better position to understand Britain. It is tragic that no play
to date has been written which honestly reveals the American spirit. I
hope with all my heart that not one but many plays will be written and
produced which, by revealing the American character and what goes on
inside American minds and hearts, will make America more understandable
to the British people.</p>

<p>Thinking along these lines, after my talk with Peter Mather, it
occurred to me suddenly: "I wonder if people thought this way during
and just after the last war. Or were we so cocksure the tragedy
couldn't happen again that we forgot about the need of understanding
between our two nations?"</p>

<p>During that winter which followed the armistice and before the
unemployment crisis threatened England, London, as I remember, was full
of Americans. Many of these were on leave before going home. Behind
them, as behind the British men one met, were the horror, filth, and
weariness of war. They wanted, above all, to forget. They wanted to be
gay....</p>

<br>


<p>November 11, 1918. The war was over. Everyone wanted to forget what
war was like and the sorrows it had brought. Everyone was determined
not to be downhearted, not to worry about the state of the postwar
world, or the future. It was true most of the men one met at parties
were either definitely middle-aged or obviously too young to have been
in the war, and for every man, at every party, there were half-a-dozen
girls. No one complained about this&mdash;it was one of the things you
had to take, one of the things four years of war had done to British
life. But this lack of men and the superabundance of women had the
effect of making the women vie with one another to attract the
attention of the men even more than women had done in other periods.
This keen competition made society more brilliant, put an edge on
parties. People did things and amused themselves in ways that would
have seemed incredible five or six years before. Many of the old social
barriers were down and the field was open to all riders.</p>

<p>I reveled in the gaiety, which meant all the more to me because of
the strain I had been living under after the baby was born. I had taken
a little flat on the fringe of Mayfair. Pam was still with Mother, and
Granny was thrilled to have her.</p>

<p>The newspapers and illustrated weeklies were making a great to-do
over Princess Mary's forthcoming marriage to Lord Lascelles. It was
exactly the kind of event calculated to fill Granny with delight and to
interest her for weeks on end. H.R.H., the Prince of Wales, was the
leader of the young set in London which had by now opened its doors to
me.</p>

<p>P.W., as his intimates referred to him, had fulfilled all the
promise I had found in those early photographs of him which I used to
pin up beside my mirror. He was debonair, amusing, charming. He and his
favorite younger brother, the Duke of Kent, went about in London's
night life, enjoying themselves and spreading pleasure wherever they
went.</p>

<p>My dressing room at the theater had two entrances&mdash;one from the
passage leading to the stage; the other, an emergency exit, which
opened directly from the alley. Many evenings the Prince of Wales and
the Duke of Kent would come up the alley, and old George, the doorman,
would let them in. I'll never forget dashing into my dressing room one
night between scenes to find the Duke of Kent seated before my mirror,
trying on a wig of long, false curls. The other members of his party
were bedeviling poor Florrie, my dresser. I had been presented to the
Prince of Wales by Captain Philip Astley, whom I had met at Mrs. Walter
Guinness', and I can still see the long music room, with its gleaming
parquet floor, and Elsa Maxwell at the piano, as I walked across it
that night with Beatrice Guinness, who whispered, "Gertrude, I want you
to meet the handsomest man in London."</p>

<p>Philip was in the Guards. He was everything a knight in armor should
be, as dreamed of by a young romantic girl. He was born at Chequers,
which is now the official country home of all British prime ministers.
He was christened in the robes of Oliver Cromwell, and educated at Eton
and the Royal Military College, added to which he was desperately
good-looking, and had unparalleled charm. We had to fall in love with
each other. It was as natural and instinctive to us both as it was for
us to breathe. There could be no thought of marriage for us. I was
still married, and any question of involvement in divorce proceedings
would have ruined Philip's career. So, although in love, we could only
be good, stanch companions. He brought the first touch of true romance
into my life.</p>

<p>Some nights after the play Philip would come and fetch me and we
would join a private party over at Roule's, the famous little
restaurant in Maiden Lane, which plays such an interesting part in the
theatrical history of London, just as the Cheshire Cheese in Fleet
Street has always been associated with the literary and legal gentlemen
of the city. The walls of Roule's were lined with signed photographs of
actors and actresses, boxing champions, cabinet ministers, and racing
figures, and the furnishings were still the same red-plush, gold-gilt
chairs, china-globed chandeliers, and marble busts of Shakespeare and
Sir Beerbohm Tree. The waiters were like "family retainers." They had
served generations of British men of note, and while considering the
wine list, it was quite the thing for them to advise: "Your father was
always very partial to the Chateau Haut Brion, 1893, sir." The place
was just the same as when Edward VII, then Prince of Wales, had given
supper parties to Lily Langtry in the private room upstairs. This was
the room in which we had our parties, and our young prince sat where
his grandfather had sat, enjoying our gay chatter and the music, which
came from the same old phonograph with its cylindrical records which
stood on a marble pedestal in the corner.</p>

<p>One of the first things I did when I reached London in the summer of
1944 was to walk through Maiden Lane to see if Roule's was still
standing. It was, and my heart bounded with joy that the Germans had
not blasted that little bit of my past into dust and ashes. Roule's was
closed and carefully shuttered. One hoped that its well-stocked cellar
was carefully sandbagged, or that the precious bottles had been sent
away into a less vulnerable part of England until the war was over. But
the building was intact. It waited, as so many places in London seemed
to wait, for England's youth and laughter to come back again.
Meanwhile, Roule's kept guard over the memories of the many gay suppers
we had had there.</p>

<p>I was often invited to the parties which the Prince of Wales gave in
his apartment in St. James's Palace, at which everyone sang and danced
and did stunts. These parties were always informal and entertaining.
You met people of all sorts and from every walk of life and profession
at the Prince's parties, but never anyone who was dull or stuffy. He
invited international tennis champions, the newest blues singer, a
guitarist who was all the rage in Paris, as well as his own intimate
set. It was amusing that all this fun went on late at night inside the
solemn old pile, with the sentries keeping up their march along the
pavement just outside.</p>

<p>Whenever Philip came round to the theater to take me to one of the
Prince's parties and our motor drove in at the gatehouse with the royal
coat of arms over its portal, I always experienced a thrill. An
unpretentious entrance led into the portion of the palace known as York
House, which was occupied by the Prince just as it had been by his
father when he was Duke of York. There was nothing elegant or stately
about the Prince's private rooms&mdash;they were those of any well-off
young bachelor who was interested in sports and in music. The Prince's
bedroom might have belonged to any British schoolboy or an officer
living in barracks. There was just a narrow, single iron bed with a
table beside it on which there was always a glass of milk and an
apple.</p>

<p>The Prince once took me on a tour of the state apartments in the
palace. We paused at the window from which, according to the
centuries-old tradition, every new sovereign is acclaimed on his
accession to the throne. Each of us was thinking silently that someday
the King's herald would proclaim from the balcony outside that very
window: "The King is dead. Long live the King&mdash;Edward VIII." But I
am sure neither of us suspected then how soon that was to happen, nor
the cataclysmic events which were to bring about the abdication of
Edward VIII. At that time, during the early twenties, no one in London
had even heard of Mrs. Wallis Warfield Simpson.</p>

<p>In having his fling before settling down to the serious business
which faced him ultimately, the Prince was giving England what the
English people have always loved since the days of Prince Hal. As old
George, the stage doorman at the theater, remarked with approbation:
"Myself, I don't 'old with princes making parsons of theirselves. No,
nor parsons and harchbishops setting theirselves up for lords." George
was Labor and definitely anticlerical. He had a newspaper photograph of
Ramsay MacDonald pasted on the wall above the backless old chair where
he sat beside the stage door. But his political views in no way
interfered with old George's truly British devotion to his King and the
Royal Family. His feeling for them, if less reverent than Granny's, was
no less loyal.</p>

<p>"Wot I say is, 'e's <i>'uman</i>. Even if Queen Victoria was his
great-grandma."</p>

<br>


<p>With the coming of the summer I rented a small riverside cottage
near Staines on the road to Windsor, and here I finally persuaded
Mother, Dad, and Granny to take up residence with Pamela and me. It was
near enough to London for me to get there every week end by train, and
after a while Philip, who was stationed at Windsor, used to pick me up
and take me home by car on his way back to barracks. Among our gay
companions at that time was Lord Latham, and several times he and
Philip and the others would stop at Buck's Club, pick up a hamper of
chicken, fruit, champagne, et cetera, and we would all roar down to the
cottage and get Mother out of bed to act as hostess. We would spread
our feast al fresco over the dining-room table under the lamp with the
silk fringe that hung from the ceiling.</p>

<p>One night we gave her a real surprise. We all arrived without
warning, as usual, and routed her out of bed. Down she came, and we had
supper. Suddenly she realized there was a stranger in our midst and
that we were calling him "sir." Her gaze shot down the table, past his
face, and fixed itself on my delighted grin; I nodded. I knew she had
recognized the Prince of Wales. She then switched her gaze to Philip,
and he smiled broadly. She was a triumph in her attempt to carry
everything off without comment, and when the party was over, and as we
stood at the gate saying good night, the Prince stretched out his hand
to her. She curtsied and said, "Good night, Your Highness." I thought
of those earlier days in Clapham: of how she always soared above debt
and constant orders to dispossess. I put my arm around her as we went
upstairs to peek at Pamela, and as I slipped into bed I grinned at her
and said, "What about my cousin Ruby now, darling?"</p>

<br>


<p>Andr&Atilde;&copy; Charlot was planning a new revue to be called
<i>A to Z</i>, in which Beatrice Lillie was to star with Jack Buchanan,
Teddy Gerrard, and the Trix Sisters. I went down to the cottage to be
with my baby and the family until something new should come along for
me. Suddenly I got a telegram from Charlot saying that Beatrice Lillie
was ill and that they had to open on a certain date. I went up to the
theater, read the various sketches, heard the music, and signed up.
Once more Beatrice Lillie's misfortune was the cause of my good
fortune. From the opening night the revue was an enormous success. I
sang "Limehouse Blues" for the first time; the orchestra was directed
by Philip (Pa) Braham, who wrote the song with Douglas Furber. Jack
Buchanan and I had wonderful material together, and Teddy Gerrard was a
sensation.</p>

<p><i>A to Z</i> was followed by another revue, <i>London Calling</i>,
in which I was starred. The show was written by Noel Coward, who had
been cutting his teeth as a dramatist and actor. Noel floated back into
my life exactly as if nothing had intervened between the days we were
at Miss Conti's and the present. Noel is like that. He can disappear
completely for three years and then ring you up and continue the
conversation you were having the last time you saw him.</p>

<p>The outstanding success of all Charlot's revues had brought him many
offers from America. During the season of 1924 Archie Selwyn came to
London, saw the revue, and arranged with Charlot to bring us to
Broadway that winter. For the American edition Charlot made a
conglomeration of popular numbers from all his revues. He signed on Bea
Lillie, who had been doing a play of her own. She and I were to be
featured as co-stars with Jack Buchanan and Herbert (Tommy) Mundin.</p>

<p>We sailed from Southampton on the last ship before Christmas, which
meant that we traveled with a lot of. Americans hurrying to get home
for the holiday, as well as a number of British people who were going
to be entertained at New York and at Palm Beach. We had a riotous trip.
The instigator of most of the fun was Max Aitken, later Lord
Beaverbrook. Alastair McIntosh, who later married Constance Talmadge
and who was the glamor boy of that year, was going home. Early in the
trip Bea and Jack and I had confided to Allie our anxiety about where
we were to stay in New York. It was the first time any of us had been
there.</p>

<p>"Leave it to me, I'll fix the whole thing," said Allie with a grand
gesture. "I'll send a radiogram to my friend William Rhinelander
Stewart. He practically owns the Ambassador. He'll fix you up."</p>

<p>"Wonderful," Bea and I chorused. We left it at that.</p>

<p>Our ship docked on Christmas Eve. The long pier was a bedlam of
porters, customs officials, reporters, and Americans welcoming home
their friends and relatives. Suddenly Bea and I began to feel very
lonely and strange. But Will Stewart was waiting at the gangplank.
Jack, Bea, and I were finally driven to the Ambassador Hotel, where we
were given two enormous suites&mdash;one for Jack and one for Bea and
myself.</p>

<p>"So this is America!" I exclaimed. "Look at that bath, will you?
Feel that delicious warmth. Central heating, my girl. No wonder they
call this the most luxurious country on earth."</p>

<p>Bea stretched herself on her bed and sighed ecstatically: "God bless
Allie McIntosh."</p>

<p>Next morning New York from our windows was wonderful. In the clear,
sparkling air the tall white buildings were tremendously exciting. The
view and the air made both of us ravenous. We ordered breakfast sent
up. Presently there was a rap at the door. "Come in," Bea called. At
that a procession of waiters, each pushing a little cart, advanced
through the door in military formation. They wheeled the breakfast in
to us, and such a breakfast&mdash;grapefruit, which we had never seen
before, enthroned on shaved ice in silver bowls the size of washbasins;
flagons of coffee and hot milk and cream; huge silver dishes under
covers which the waiters whisked off with a flourish to reveal enormous
slices of ham, toasted muffins, and God knows what all. "Take no
notice," said Bea. "It's all done with mirrors." It was like a
musical-comedy sketch only, as we discovered when the chief waiter
ceremoniously presented us with the bill, the comic element was
lacking. The bill was very real indeed, and for an amount that
staggered us.</p>

<p>We were both still very hazy about the value of American money. I
wasn't too sure of the value of the dollar in relation to the English
pound. Bea lay back on her bed, pretended to be completely bored by the
whole business, and said loftily, "Sign the check, darling, and give
all the waiters a nice fat tip. Don't forget, it's Christmas."</p>

<p>This was no joke to me. "Come on, Bea," I said, "we've got to work
this out and see how much we each owe, and how much we've got with
which to pay it." We got out our purses and poured the contents onto
the bed as soon as the waiters had gone.</p>

<p>Bea said, "It's perfectly simple. We each owe three dollars and
fifty cents."</p>

<p>So we started to try to work it out, not knowing one piece of
American money from another, until we laughed so hard that we were
exhausted. When our laughter finally subsided, however, the seriousness
of our position dawned upon us, and I said, "Let's call Jack and see if
he's had breakfast."</p>

<p>A faint voice answered the telephone. "Yes, I've had breakfast, have
you?"</p>

<p>"How much was yours?" I asked, and Jack replied, "It looks like
three hundred and fifty shillings."</p>

<p>I relayed this to Bea and she said, "Tell him to come up here at
once." He arrived, and we explained that he owed only three dollars and
fifty cents, but that we were of the opinion that we were all in the
wrong surroundings. After all, we were only in the rehearsal stage for
the show&mdash;we might not be a success when we did open, and we had
to have some money to get around with until then. "We'll have to get
out of here at once," said Jack. Bea and I agreed. "But we must be
dignified about it. Think of Will and Allie. They recommended us. How
can we get out?"</p>

<p>Jack did some quick telephoning, got hold of Archie Selwyn, and
explained our problem. We were recommended to Frank Case, who owns the
Algonquin Hotel. Archie added: "And for God's sake, Jack, if you want
to keep out of jail, don't let those dames sign any more blank
checks."</p>

<p>As we were driving across town to our new hotel I suddenly saw what
I took to be an enormous wild animal ambling down Fifth Avenue where we
were stopped by a traffic light. I clutched Bea's arm.</p>

<p>"Look at that. What do you think it is?"</p>

<p>Bea peered out the window and began to laugh. She was born in
Toronto and therefore not unaccustomed to the extraordinary sight of a
six-foot man wearing a raccoon coat.</p>

<p>The light changed and the taxi shot across the Avenue and into
Forty-fourth Street. Halfway along the block I exclaimed:</p>

<p>"There's that raccoon man again! How did he get here so
quickly?"</p>

<p>Bea laughed again and explained.</p>

<p>"Do you actually mean there could be two of them in New York at
once?" I demanded, awe-struck.</p>

<p>Within the next two days I was to learn that every undergraduate in
town for the holidays was going about draped to the heels in shaggy
skins, as though made up to play the lion in <i>Androcles and the
Lion</i>.</p>

<p>At the Algonquin Bea and I were given a room such as we might have
had in the Midlands at home. The minute we looked around at the rather
dark-figured wallpaper, the old-fashioned electric-light fixtures, the
Brussels carpet, and the two brass beds with their crimson down-filled
comforters, we said to each other: "This is more like it."</p>

<p>Before our New York opening, Bea and I were taken to see all the
shows on Broadway. The boys rallied round to show us the
town&mdash;Eddie Goulding, Billy Reardon, Allie, and Will Stewart. We
soon lost that stranger-in-our-midst feeling that had come over us on
the dock when our ship's companions flitted away and left Bea, Jack,
and me sitting there with our luggage. We began to love New York.</p>

<h2 id="chapter12">12</h2>

<br>


<blockquote>Lillie and Lawrence,<br>
Lawrence and Lillie,<br>
If you haven't seen them,<br>
You're perfectly silly.</blockquote>

<p>One of the newspaper boys started singing that at a party one night
to a tune of his own improvisation. This little ditty ran through our
winter in New York with the persistence of a highly plugged theme song.
But it was very complimentary, even if it wasn't good poetry, and it
expressed some of the feeling&mdash;the gaiety, the nonsense, the
lighthearted fun&mdash;which made <i>Charlot's Revue</i> unusual and
memorable.</p>

<p>At least these were some of the things the New York critics said of
the show when it opened at the Selwyn Theatre on New Year's Eve after a
week's tryout in Atlantic City. "People" (and that included ourselves)
who thought American audiences would never be amused by the English
brand of humor were forced to think again when the Revue, which came
originally for a six weeks' engagement, was held on for nine months.
The critics&mdash;Heywood Broun, George Jean Nathan, Percy Hammond,
Burns Mantle, Ring Lardner, with Alexander Woollcott in the
lead&mdash;gave their approval without qualification. These nabobs of
the press were pleased with the potpourri Charlot had put together for
them. They called each of us names&mdash;nice names. Their judgment had
such a powerful influence on the American public that the show
immediately became the outstanding smash hit of the season on Broadway
and a "must" on everybody's list.</p>

<p>What seemed to impress the majority of critics was that the
<i>Revue</i> was completely unlike any entertainment of its type ever
given in New York heretofore. It is not difficult to explain the
difference between <i>Charlot's Revue of 1924</i> and other musical
shows, such as Ziegfeld's <i>Follies</i> and George White's
<i>Scandals</i>, with which New Yorkers were familiar. Charlot's revues
were characterized by an exquisite economy, a camaraderie between all
the players and the audience such as had not been known in America up
to this time. It was not a rough-and-ready intimacy, and never a
jocular ad-libbing, but a mental closeness hard to define, and
immediate in its appeal. His revues did not depend upon spectacular
lighting and scenic effects for success. Most of the sketches were
played against drapes, which were beautiful in themselves but not
breath-taking. There was no spectacular electrical display. And no
tremendous chorus, such as Ziegfeld and Earl Carroll featured in their
productions. But every girl in the line had been selected to give an
intimate individuality to the production.</p>

<p>"I do not engage an artist and then find a place for her," Charlot
used to say. "First, I have the place; then I find the artist to fit
it. I never buy names. What I pay for is personality, charm, talent."
He certainly hadn't bought my name&mdash;he made it for me.</p>

<p>In place of the magical big names, gorgeous costumes advertised as
costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, extraordinary mechanical
effects, and much-featured show girls, the <i>Revue</i> depended for
its success upon four principals backed by a well-picked small company,
which gave a series of sketches, songs, and dances.</p>

<p>There was nothing bordering on the salacious in any of the acts. I
think this proves conclusively that Americans and British alike welcome
and will always support theatrical entertainment which is neither
coarse, indecent, nor ribald.</p>

<p>As one American reviewer expressed it: "You don't have to be
broad-minded to enjoy <i>Cbarlot's Revue</i>."</p>

<p>One of the high spots in the Revue was Bea Lillie's "March with Me"
number, in which, dressed as Britannia, she led the line of girls,
maintaining a very dignified and stiff demeanor while getting all
tangled up with her feet and her props. Bea is one of those artists who
are never any good at a rehearsal. She is a spontaneous comedienne. She
needs the exhilaration of having an audience in front of her. Everyone
who has ever worked with her knows this and knows that, though she is
shy at rehearsals, she can be trusted to put her numbers over
magnificently, and in her own inimitable way, when the moment
comes.</p>

<p>But Archie Selwyn didn't know this when we were rehearsing for our
New York opening. When he saw the "March with Me" number he shook his
head over it. "When is she going to show me something?" he kept asking
Charlot. And when Bea remained quiet and unresponsive, Archie declared
the "March with Me" number, which had been a tremendous hit in London,
would fall flat on Broadway. He tried to get Charlot to cut it from the
show.</p>

<p>But Charlot knew his star. He refused to be budged an inch by
Archie, and merely smiled blandly at all the gloomy prophecies; at even
the two most direful words in theatrical parlance&mdash;"It
stinks!"</p>

<p>And of course Charlot was right, as the opening night and every
performance thereafter proved. Bea Lillie, as Britannia in "March with
Me," was the outstanding hit of the <i>Revue</i>.</p>

<p>I had a number of sketches with Jack and Bea and Herbert Mundin, and
I sang "Limehouse Blues" with Fred Leslie and Robert Hobbs. I also had
a quiet little song called "I Don't Know" which caught on at once.</p>

<p>"Limehouse Blues" immediately became popular. We heard it in every
night club in New York. In England we never plugged songs as they do in
the United States, and I was surprised and extremely flattered to find
everyone singing and playing "Limehouse" wherever I went. As a matter
of fact they still do, after all these years.</p>

<p>I had a lot of things to learn about America and the American way of
doing things; especially about the relative values of British and
American expressions. I learned about these by the trial-and-error
method.</p>

<p>Bea had been in America for a holiday when she married Robert Peel
in 1922, but, like me, she knew nothing of the American theater or the
reactions of American audiences. From the minute we landed until the
night of our opening in New York I had gone around feeling as though
someone had shot a hole through my middle; then, when we knew the show
was a success and made the wonderful, exciting discovery that New
Yorkers liked us, I felt suddenly like a colt in a pasture. My heels
kicked up instinctively. I no longer walked, I pranced.</p>

<p>Determined to find out all we could about America, we went to all
the plays we could crowd in, and on Sundays to the pictures.</p>

<p>Bea and I took a duplex apartment together in a converted house on
West Fifty-fourth Street and this soon became a rendezvous for a gay
crowd. Many of those who came there were connected, in one way or
another, with the theater. There were composers, writers of lyrics,
playwrights, and newspapermen. They would drop in at all hours, and it
seemed to make no difference to them at all whether Bea or I was there.
If we weren't, they would immediately make themselves comfortable and
wait for one or the other of us to turn up.</p>

<p>We gave a lot of parties there. For one reason, it was such an easy
thing to do. Whenever we gave parties, our friends would send us
flowers, sometimes superb food from swanky restaurants and clubs, and a
more-than-adequate supply of wines and spirits. William Rhinelander
Stewart still hovered, and when spring came he sent a florist with
orders to plant and maintain the garden at the rear of our apartment.
And with the warm, sunny weather our parties moved out there. Our
steady salonites included such grand people as Neysa McMein, Dorothy
Parker, Jeanne Eagels, Bob Sherwood, Richard Barthelmess, Laurette
Taylor, Will Stewart, Eddie McIlwain, Allie McIntosh, George Ross,
Charles Dillingham, Jimmie Walker, Aarons and Freedley, Ohman and
Arden, Oscar Hammerstein, Howard Dietz, Arthur Schwartz, Jerome Kern,
Irene Castle, Fanny Brice, June Walker, Estelle Winwood, Lenore Ulric,
Billy Reardon, Irving Caesar and Vincent Youmans, Zez Confrey, Kallmer
and Ruby, Rogers and Hart, George and Ira Gershwin, Irving Berlin,
Jules Glaenzer, Clifton Webb, Prince Dmitri, Schuyler Parsons, Jascha
Heifetz, Alexander Woollcott, and Eddie Goulding.</p>

<p>Alexander Woollcott quickly became one of our best friends. He used
to frown and shake his big head and wiggle his fat forefinger in my
face, like a schoolmaster.</p>

<p>"Young female, do you realize that you two girls have been feted
over here as no visitors from overseas have been in the last twenty
years?"</p>

<p>"I know!" I would look and feel very impressed. "But, Uncle
Alexander, Americans are so enthusiastic. What's the Statue of Liberty
for?"</p>

<p>Though I loved to tease Uncle Aleck and never could resist the
temptation to do so, I valued his criticism and his praise whenever he
saw fit to bestow either. He had&mdash;what is not at all rare in big,
rather untidy men&mdash;unerring taste, and a sense of the delicacy of
a situation. It pleased me no end when he said to me one day: "With no
more than a pout, a twist of your shoulders, and two or three lines,
you make me feel that I understand exactly how the wheels go round at
the back of a girl's mind."</p>

<p>That, I knew, was a real tribute to Gertrude Lawrence the actress.
Meanwhile, Gertrude Lawrence the woman savored the flattery of Percy
Hammond's remark in his column: "It has been said of Miss Lawrence that
every man in New York is, or was, in love with her."</p>

<p>So, without setting out to do it, Bea Lillie and I achieved the fame
of being written up by the columnists, one of whom said, "Among the
famous places to be visited in New York is the apartment of Beatrice
Lillie and Gertrude Lawrence. <i>If you can get in.</i>"</p>

<p>As I look back over those mad, crowded months in New York, I cannot
remember that Bea or I ever went to bed. Perhaps neither of us wanted
to miss any of the fun, the laughter, and the music. People were always
around. Scarcely a day went by that we weren't looked up by someone
just over from London, who had dropped around the first thing to see
us. During that summer the Prince of Wales came over for a visit to
America before going on to his ranch in Canada. In his party, or
following in its train, were a number of old friends of Bea's or mine,
and they made our apartment their informal headquarters in New
York.</p>

<p>The piano in our apartment went all the time. Vincent Youmans was
trying out new compositions. It never seemed to make any difference to
him, or George Gershwin, that the conversation and laughter went on
around him all the time and that no one paid the slightest attention to
what he was doing. One might have thought this a most unfavorable
atmosphere for the composition of musical scores, but as a matter of
record Vincent Youmans and Irving Caesar wrote most of the score of
<i>No, No, Nanette</i> in our living room, including "Tea for Two."</p>

<p>My friendship with George Gershwin and his brother Ira, which began
that winter, was to develop into a wonderfully successful partnership
when the brothers wrote the score and the lyrics of <i>Oh, Kay!</i> for
me a year later. Gershwin was an assiduous worker and never spared
himself. I remember going to hear his first performance of the
"Rhapsody in Blue" at Aeolian Hall, and we met at a cocktail party at
Cond&Atilde;&copy; Nast's afterward. George arrived late with every
finger of both hands bandaged from the strain the "Rhapsody" had
demanded. He was a great man.</p>

<p>Of all the friends Bea and I made that winter, Jules Glaenzer was
the most fabulous. He was the New York head of Cartier's and was famous
for giving magical parties. He called us the Big Three&mdash;Lillie,
Buchanan, and Lawrence.</p>

<p>Jules Glaenzer loved the theater and the theater folk loved him.
Whenever I think of the parties at his house I always hear two or three
pianos going at once. I think it can safely be said that more talent
has been discovered in Jules Glaenzer's drawing room than anywhere else
in New York, especially during the years of the middle twenties. Jules
is one of those wonderful people, rare in any country and any society,
who have great discrimination and who&mdash;though not artists
themselves&mdash;are creative in their ability to encourage and develop
artists of every sort. When he discovers a musician or a dancer or a
painter, he is as thrilled over his find as if he had turned up a new
and priceless gem.</p>

<p>I found American men extremely likable and flatteringly
appreciative. Perhaps you have to be born an Englishwoman to realize
how much attention American men shower on women and how tremendously
considerate all the nice ones among them are of a woman's wishes.</p>

<p>It had been a surprise for us in the cast of <i>Charlot's Revue</i>
to discover that the season on Broadway usually closed on June first,
with a few shows running through the summer months. This, of course,
was the exact reverse of things in London, where the season in the
theater coincided with the "season" at Court and in society, which
commences in May and continues until August bank holiday. So none of us
had expected to stay on in New York through the summer. It was more or
less generally understood that the <i>Revue</i> would close shortly
before Easter and that we would sail for home to open in London when
everyone would be in town. However, business on Broadway was so good
that Archie Selwyn arranged with Charlot not only to hold the
<i>Revue</i> over but to move to a larger theater, the Times Square,
next door. At the end of September we would start on a twenty weeks'
tour, playing four weeks in Boston, two weeks in Philadelphia, four
weeks in Chicago, and the major stands west of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Our last night on Broadway was a fitting climax to the whole amazing
nine months. The two front rows of the orchestra seats were taken by
the columnists, critics, and celebrities of the theater. In fact,
hardly anyone who was in the house that night was seeing the
<i>Revue</i> for the first time. The majority of those in the audience
knew our songs and sketches almost as well as we did, and their
laughter and applause were not for the song or the sketch, but a
personal and affectionate tribute to the actors. Bea's banjo voice and
her famous index finger, which, as one reviewer put it, "was as elegant
and uplifted as ever," were cheered as enthusiastically as if both were
new to Broadway.</p>

<p>In one of Bea's numbers it was her custom to jump off the stage in
fleeing from an Apache lover, and regain it again only after scrambling
across the auditorium between the knees of those seated in the front
row and the orchestra rail. At each performance Bea would drop
unexpectedly into some man's lap. On closing night the lap she selected
was Alexander Woollcott's very commodious one. We thought we should
never get back onto the stage that night.</p>

<p>People were always telling us how surprised they were to find that
the two women stars in the same show were good friends even to the
point of living together. When we went into the Times Square Theatre,
we found ourselves in adjoining dressing rooms, both of them small and
stuffy. We asked to have the door removed between the two rooms. This
allowed us to use one to dress in and the other for our visitors. It
seemed to us a perfectly intelligent and not at all unusual way of
arranging things, but we soon found that people were amazed by it,
especially the manager of the show which was scheduled to follow us at
that theater.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said, "the two dames in our show haven't spoken since
we opened. That door will have to be closed up between them rooms or
there'll be murder."</p>

<p>On our closing night, after the finale, the whole house stood up and
cheered us. They pelted us with flowers. When the orchestra struck up
"Auld Lang Syne" the audience and company joined in the singing.
Everyone took hold of the hand of the person next to him. The chain of
friendly handclasps stretched across the stage, across the footlights,
and continued through the house.</p>

<p>When the audience was finally pushed out of the theater several
hundred of them merely adjourned to the stage door, where they formed
such an imposing mob scene that traffic was clogged in Forty-second
Street.</p>

<p>When Bea and I came out, laden with flowers, to get into our waiting
taxi, we found the roof of the vehicle packed with the more ardent
revelers, who escorted us through the streets of New York singing our
own songs to us.</p>

<br>


<p>When we closed in New York we went to play Boston. I very nearly
said to play Harvard College, because the house was sold out night
after night to Harvard boys, many of whom had already seen the show in
New York several times over, and had come backstage and were friends of
the cast. Johnny Green was one of them.</p>

<p>Johnny came round to my dressing room the night before we closed in
Boston to take me out to supper.</p>

<p>"I can't go," I told him. "I'm ill. I have a terrible cold."</p>

<p>It was true. I had been fending off a cold for several weeks, and as
soon as we reached Boston the climate there had overcome all my
efforts. I was feverish and hoarse and shivering miserably. Johnny
looked me over critically.</p>

<p>"By rights, you should be home and in bed," he said.</p>

<p>"That's exactly where I'm going," I told him. "I'd like to crawl
into bed and stay there for a week." The thought of having to play two
shows the next day made me feel limp.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll get you over it," Johnny offered. "Do you know the best
way to cure a cold instantly?"</p>

<p>"No. How?"</p>

<p>"Castor oil."</p>

<p>"I'd rather die, thank you."</p>

<p>"I'll show you a way so you'll never taste it." And when I looked at
him doubtfully, he added, "All the fellows take it that way. It is one
of the things you learn at Harvard."</p>

<p>I agreed to let Johnny dose me, and he took me home to the hotel and
ordered up a terrifying quantity of castor oil and half a dozen bottles
of sarsaparilla. "What's the sarsaparilla for?" I demanded
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"You'll find out," said Johnny, and began, with a bartender's
gestures, to shake up a fizz of oil and sarsaparilla.</p>

<p>"Now, toss that off!"</p>

<p>I downed the nauseating mixture and made a face.</p>

<p>"You British are decidedly effete," said Johnny patronizingly.
"Undoubtedly the best blood of England came over on the
<i>Mayflower</i>. The ones the Pilgrim Fathers left behind simply
didn't have the stamina."</p>

<p>"Oh! Didn't we!" Between the kidding and the castor oil my temper
was rising. My eye lighted on the bulky case on top of one of my
trunks. In it was the saxophone Johnny was teaching me to play. I took
the sax out of its case and blew a wailing note.</p>

<p>"My God, it sounds like a French taxicab," he cried.</p>

<p>(I found out in 1929 that those discordant notes on the saxophone
were the inspiration for one of Johnny's greatest song hits, "Body and
Soul." I took the song to England with me and later I gave it to Libby
Holman.)</p>

<p>I glared at him and put all my efforts into what I hoped would be a
rousing rendition of "God Save the King." I sounded most of the notes,
but a few were squeaky and others trailed off forlornly. The more
Johnny grinned, the more determined I was to play my national anthem,
so I kept at it.</p>

<p>"Ah yes," said Johnny reminiscently, "'America.' I know that number
too." And to my accompaniment he began to sing unfamiliar words that
had to do with the scenery of the United States. I tried to drown out
his singing with the sax. All at once I began to feel very
peculiar.</p>

<blockquote><i>"Let music swell the breeze,</i><br>
<i>And ring from all the trees</i><br>
<i>Sweet freedom's song..."</i></blockquote>

thundered Johnny.

<p>"S-Q-A-A-A-K," went the saxophone. It dropped between my knees and I
tumbled over it. Johnny gathered me up and carried me into the
bathroom, where I proceeded to be thoroughly and embarrassingly
sick.</p>

<p>He had the effrontery to look pleased with the whole proceeding, and
when he had helped me back into my bed and covered me up with all the
blankets available the wretch congratulated me on my fine performance.
"You'll wake up in the morning and never know you had a cold," he
assured me. "That's the way we do things at Harvard."</p>

<p>Maybe that drastic treatment works wonders on the students at
Harvard College. It failed with me. I was ill and miserable all next
day, though I managed to drag myself through the two performances. When
the company left for Toronto, I felt like something the cat had dragged
home, and whenever Charlot looked at me there was a little worried
frown between his eyes. My voice was hoarser than ever, and I was
definitely lightheaded.</p>

<p>Toronto was Bea's home town and welcomed us with open arms. The
house was sold out right through our stay there, and parties were
scheduled for every night. I didn't want to seem a spoilsport, so I
kept going though I alternately shivered and burned with fever.</p>

<p>On Thursday evening Bea Lillie said to me: "There's a man here I
used to be engaged to as a kid. He's giving a party for us tonight at
his house."</p>

<p>I said I thought I wouldn't go.</p>

<p>"Oh, darling, you mustn't miss it," said Bea. "It's sure to be lots
of fun. They are coming for us in a car. We needn't stay long."</p>

<p>"Very well," I replied.</p>

<p>After the performance we motored to our host's house outside the
city where about twenty people were waiting for us in a big living
room. My head was throbbing, and I was cold all over. I got into a big
chair as close to the fire as I could and basked in its warmth. I had
taken several aspirins before I left the theater. I was aware that my
chest hurt, but for some unexplainable reason these things no longer
mattered. They were happening to someone who was no longer I. Presently
we all went into the dining room to supper. Out of the mist that
surrounded me appeared a short, slight elderly man who smiled and
whispered:</p>

<p>"I've been to see your play tonight. My dear, you have the heart of
a bullock, but you are riding for a fall. Take care."</p>

<p>I tried to toss off some light rejoinder. "Silly little old man," I
thought. "He looks like 'Mr. Pim Passes By!'"</p>

<p>As though in response to my thought, he floated away again into the
mist and was replaced by other figures. There were so many I began to
feel dizzy. "I don't feel well," I said suddenly. "Please, won't
someone take me home?" Someone apparently did, though I was past being
aware of who it was. All I knew was that presently I was in my
bed&mdash;and drifting off to sleep.</p>

<p>Suddenly I woke. I switched on the light. Four o'clock. I looked
around my room. Everything in it was familiar, but everything was about
four times the size it should have been. I felt like Alice in
Wonderland. I crawled out of bed and looked into Bea's room, which
adjoined mine. Bea had not come in yet.</p>

<p>I found the thermometer that I carried in my dressing case and tried
to find out if I had a temperature. The figures on the little glass
stick read 104 degrees. "That can't be right," I thought. "No one can
have a temperature of 104 degrees." I crept back into bed and closed my
throbbing eyes.</p>

<p>I must have dozed again, for when I woke it was five o'clock. Again
I took my temperature&mdash;104 degrees. "What a silly thermometer." I
got up and went into Bea's room. She was in bed, sleeping peacefully,
but I woke her.</p>

<p>"Bea," I mumbled, and my voice came from miles away, "do you know
how to take a temperature?"</p>

<p>Bea yawned while I held the tube under my tongue for a minute; then
she blinked at the figures. "One hundred and four!" she said in an awed
tone.</p>

<p>"That's what it said before," I told her. "Bea, what happens when
you have a temperature of 104 degrees?"</p>

<p>"You die," said Bea. "Get back into bed, darling. I'm going to call
a doctor."</p>

<p>Meekly I obeyed. Everything became even more out of proportion. I
felt I was living in a dream, and this seemed all the more credible
when suddenly there appeared at my bedside the same kindly old
gentleman I had met that evening at the party. "Didn't I tell you so?"
he remarked, but not crossly. Then he proceeded to give orders to the
nurses who appeared as if by magic, and I was rolled in blankets and
carried downstairs, stuffed into an ambulance, and motored away to
Wellesley Hospital. I heard someone say, "Double pneumonia." Another
voice said, "Pleurisy." Someone else said, "Dr. Ross is in charge of
the case."</p>

<p>I did not know when the <i>Revue</i> closed in Toronto and the
company went on to its next date, leaving me behind. I didn't know that
there were stories in all the newspapers, telling that Gertrude
Lawrence was desperately ill. Or that a photograph of me in a hospital
bed, and looking as though I already had one foot in the grave,
appeared in a London paper where Mother saw it and nearly died of
shock. I didn't know anything at all until one day I opened my eyes and
found myself lying, literally embowered in flowers. Bewildering sprays
of forsythia, dogwood, and lilac covered the walls. Baskets of roses
and lilies were banked against these, and there was an enchanting,
fully trimmed Christmas tree in the corner. The last words I remembered
hearing Bea Lillie say flashed through my mind:</p>

<p>"When you have a temperature of 104 degrees, you die."</p>

<p>"So I'm dead," I thought. "It's not bad at all. I feel like <i>La
Dame aux Camellias</i>."</p>

<p>It was while I lay in Wellesley Hospital in Toronto that I first
realized there was something wonderful in being somebody. There in the
hospital, with no member of my family or even an old friend near me, I
made the discovery that, through caring about my work, people had come
to care about me when I was ill, and this was deeply satisfying. All
the telegrams, cablegrams, and letters which poured into the hospital
from people in the United States and at home, all the flowers and
messages and other gifts from people who were complete strangers to me
and who knew me only as an actress who had entertained them, and even
the stupendous floral offerings of Mr. Ziegfeld which arrived from New
York packed in ice and at regular intervals&mdash;all these were proof
positive. They were a beautiful way of saying "thank you" for the gift
of laughter. They were the rewards for hours of rehearsal and hard
work, and the schooling of Andr&Atilde;&copy; Charlot.</p>

<p>I had apparently been very ill&mdash;had had transfusions&mdash;and
missed Christmas, hence the tree.</p>

<p>I was ill for fourteen weeks. Toward the end of that time Philip
Astley came over from England and stayed in Toronto so he could visit
me. As soon as Dr. Ross said I could be moved, a nurse was engaged and
Philip took us to New York and right aboard ship. Dr. Ross had ordered
me to take a long rest in the sun and approved Philip's suggestion of
taking me to stay with mutual friends who had a villa on the
Riviera.</p>

<p>As soon as I was able, we motored about the Riviera and over the
border into Italy and far into Sicily. We went sight-seeing in mellow
old temples, and we lived where the garden walls were hung with
wistaria and amid lemon and orange and olive blossoms&mdash;the most
romantic stage drop I ever played against. How lucky I was to have seen
all that beauty before its destruction by this war.</p>

<p>Charlot cabled us that the company was scheduled to sail from New
York. Philip motored me from Italy up to Cherbourg to meet the ship,
and there I rejoined Bea, Jack, Tommy, Charlot, and the company, and
went on with them to England to be ready to open at the Prince of Wales
Theatre in the "Triumphant return from America of <i>Charlot's
Revue</i>."</p>

<br>


<p>From Catterick our E.N.S.A. caravan took the road to the north with
Glasgow as our ultimate destination, but when we arrived in Newcastle
the first night, we found orders to drive back forty miles along the
way we had come to put on a concert at Barnard Castle for the Tank
Corps. We were all pretty ratty by then, as we had had no rest, no
food, and we were faced with the forty-mile ride back to Newcastle
after the show. Eighty miles to give one half-hour show. It was lucky
all of us were veteran troupers, experienced in playing one-night
stands. There is no room for a prima donna and no field for the
prima-donna temperament on a camp tour.</p>

<p>When I first joined up with the others I was aware that they watched
me narrowly. They wondered if I could take it. That made me smile.
Hadn't I been a trouper myself for years? I knew all the discomforts of
being on the road&mdash;at least I thought I did. I was to find that
playing the camps in wartime is quite different from playing
theaters&mdash;even small ones&mdash;during peace.</p>

<p>But those furtive, wary glances reminded me of the time I made a
film at Paramount's Long Island studio. I had just finished starring in
<i>Candle-Light</i>. I hadn't been working at the studio for more than
a few days before I realized everyone was waiting for me to blow up and
be temperamental. When I did not, I got the feeling I had failed to
live up to expectations; failed to behave as a star was popularly
supposed to behave.</p>

<p>Our unit was one of the lucky ones, with no personality to sound a
sour note. After weeks of touring together, we had settled down into a
good working company. Each of us could appreciate, through experience,
the qualities of all the others.</p>

<p>Big, blonde Zo&Atilde;&laquo; Monte, who sang sentimental ballads in
a high, astonishingly true soprano, and her husband, Basil Melford,
were our double act. Zo&Atilde;&laquo; and Basil had been married for
twenty-five years and were devoted to each other. She looked after him
and mothered him, which he pretended to rebel against, but obviously
couldn't have done without.</p>

<p>Clarence Myerscough's orchestra was one of our attractions. Clarence
is a Lancashireman, but from studying and appearing for years abroad he
has lost his Lancashire burr and now owns an accent which has become so
perfect I thought he could have come only from Vienna. The Viennese
note suited Clarence amazingly. In fact, it suited him so perfectly
that I think even he, as well as everyone else, had forgotten it was
not real. Later on we were to be very grateful for his knowledge of
French&mdash;especially the patois.</p>

<p>A third act was supplied by Wilfred Hubbard and his "fifty-two
assistants"&mdash;a pack of cards. Wilfred's tricks were a never-ending
amazement to us in the unit as well as to the audiences.</p>

<p>Our accompanist, May, was Irish&mdash;innocent, vague, and a
darling. Stanley Kilburn was our pianist, and a very brilliant one.
Stanley had ulcers of the stomach which Mary Barrett, who shepherded
all of us, undertook to cure. I think Mary's chief concern during our
tour was to keep me happy and at the top of my form and to return
Stanley to London headquarters minus his ulcers. Mary's real boss was
Gracie Fields, about whom she had a ceaseless fund of stories.
Fortunately, she and all the other members of the unit were endowed
with that priceless ingredient for making an adventure go over&mdash;a
sense of humor. We were often able to laugh about things that happened
to us en route, which, in different company, would have been annoying
and infuriating.</p>

<p>I was thinking of this during the short stay we made in Edinburgh. I
hadn't been in the hotel five minutes when a dour-looking man, whom I
noticed standing in the lobby, came over to our group and addressed
himself to me. "Do ye ken are there any E.N.S.A. shows in Edinburgh the
noo?"</p>

<p>I said I didn't know of any. "Why?"</p>

<p>He drew down his overlong upper lip with great seriousness. His
voice dropped confidentially. "Did you no' hear aboot the trouble over
at Ballycraig?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied.</p>

<p>"The wee bairns threw stones at the actors."</p>

<p>"Why did they do that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Happen they didna like them." He smacked his lips. "We Scots are
vurra particular."</p>

<p>"So I've heard," I said pacifically. "As a matter of fact, our
E.N.S.A. troupe has played to a good many Scottish soldiers. And I've
played in Edinburgh myself. Nothing like that has happened to me."</p>

<p>"Nay," he said. "But ye can neverrr tell when it might, lassie. So
take this wee pamphlet." He handed me a tract with the alarming title:
TAKE HEED, FOR THE END DRAWETH NIGH. And with that walked away.</p>

<p>Though we weren't stoned anywhere by the particular Scots, we had
encountered a sufficient number of difficulties before we landed in
Edinburgh. For instance, when we arrived at Dundonald, outside Glasgow,
to put on our show, we found that the coach with all the costumes and
the musicians' dress suits and instruments was missing. We postponed
the show for an hour. When that passed and still no coach had arrived,
Stanley, the pianist, Clarence&mdash;who always carried his violin in
his lap while traveling&mdash;and I started a sort of impromptu show of
our own and kept things going until the costumes did arrive and the
others were ready. Around 10:00 P.M. our real show opened. We rang down
at eleven forty-five, dog-tired, but knowing we hadn't failed the boys,
and happy in their applause. We were invited to go to the mess for a
drink, which we did and were glad of&mdash;no food though. Then we
motored back the thirty-five miles to Glasgow, only to find that the
hotel had fed our suppers to some hungry sailors and had bedded down a
number of the jack-tars in our bedrooms. By doubling up, however, we
managed to get some sleep.</p>

<p>When we set out from London for the north, it was with the definite
promise that, having played the camps en route, our unit would then be
sent on to the Orkneys. As everyone knew, though the censorship
jealously guarded news from that terrifically important naval base, the
Fleet put in and out of Scapa Flow. Since that censorship still holds,
I am constrained to tell only briefly the story of our tour of this
advanced post.</p>

<p>We left our motorized equipment in Edinburgh to fly over the
Highlands and the narrow but tempestuous Pentland Firth which divides
the Orkneys from John o' Groats. The Firth is only six to eight miles
across, but it has a bad reputation for its dangerous currents, and I
was more than glad that we were to fly over it. The flight north from
Edinburgh was wonderful, though we ran through alternate rainstorms,
sunshine, and mists. This, of course, was the country to which, in
happier days, Philip and his friends went regularly every twelfth of
August for the grouse shooting. Nothing short of a broken back could
have caused Philip not to keep his annual August engagement with the
Scotch grouse.</p>

<p>We were driven to our billets in Kirkwall, which is the largest town
in the islands, just a mile or two from Scapa. The place had been built
as a hotel for anglers and vacationists; then came the war, and the
Navy took it over for billets. I had my first bath in three days, then
dropped into bed and slept like a child.</p>

<p>The place was like a barracks, and full of WRENS, WAAFS, soldiers,
sailors, marines, and their wives and children. At 6:00 A.M. the
sergeant in charge tramped down the corridor and banged on the door of
every room with an iron ladle, of all things, until the occupant
replied, thereby giving evidence he or she was awake. I was up and out
early, relishing the brisk salt breeze.</p>

<p>We were invited to lunch with Admiral Sir Henry Moore aboard the
flagship H.M.S. <i>Duke of York</i>. Afterward his launch took us to
our permanent billets on the island of Flotta. Here E.N.S.A. had its
own hut, just like an army Nissen hut, except it was made of wood. The
eighteen members of our unit crowded the hut almost to bursting. The
girls shared three rooms, and the boys had one large one at the end of
the hut, with me in a single in the middle. The nights were cold, with
high winds. We used to collect driftwood to burn in the coke stove
while we got ready for bed. All our journeys had to be made by
"drifter." It was fun going out, but the return trips were
uncomfortable, long, and cold.</p>

<p>It was amazing on this isolated, bleak, treeless reef, with its
entanglements of barbed wire, to find a fine theater&mdash;good stage,
dressing rooms, and excellent acoustics. And of course the most
appreciative audiences in the world. The men were either stationed here
for the duration and sealed in or they had come in from the sea,
veterans of many tough battles.</p>

<p>We shoved off about 1:00 P.M. in a drifter for the garden spot of
the Orkneys, which is a little island called South Ronaldsay. Its port
has the lovely name of St. Margaret's Hope. We went aboard to a stiff
breeze, a good swell, and a strong smell of frying fish. Mary Barrett
immediately nosed out the galley and saw to it that a half kipper was
passed out to all of us. As we had an hour's trip ahead of us to St.
Margaret's Hope, the smell of the crew's mess and the sample we had of
it were maddening. How do men live for days and days at sea without
food and water? Then, as if in answer to my hunger pangs, a head popped
up the galley steps from below and a voice said: "Yer tea's ready."</p>

<p>We girls&mdash;Zo&Atilde;&laquo;, Joan, May, Mary, and I&mdash;went
below and had the most wonderful meal with the skipper and his three
mates. Great mugs of ship's tea, huge slices of bread thickly spread
with butter and jam, and a dish of kippers <i>cooked in butter!</i>
After we had eaten our fill, the men of our unit were invited down to
be fed.</p>

<p>The drifter's crew did this for us voluntarily, and the only way we
could show our appreciation was to see that they were all invited to
the show we put on that night. One of our most, appreciative observers
was the Bishop of Edinburgh, who was visiting the flagship and sat in
the front row and laughed louder than any of the sailors, although I
think he had his gentle doubts about the merits of "I Wanna Get
Married."</p>

<p>This life is certainly one of ups and downs&mdash;one day tea and
kippers with the drifter's crew, the next, dinner at Malsetta House
with Sir Robert and Lady Harwood, which is the Government House of the
Orkneys. The first intimation I had of being introduced into this
atmosphere of gold braid and good breeding was the message that Sir
Robert and Lady Harwood would like to meet me, and please would I call
at Malsetta House on my way to the show. I thought this a bit odd, as I
had known Sir Robert when he was on the <i>Exeter</i> and before he was
knighted for sinking the <i>Graf Spee</i>. However, the Malsetta House
car met us at the pier at Hoy and drove Mary and me ten miles to be
greeted by a house party of twelve people. Lady Harwood said: "Hello,
my dear. Would you like to go straight to your room or will I just send
your bag up?"</p>

<p>I said that I was going to dress at the theater, at which Sir Robert
cut in: "But you're dining and staying the night with us, as your shows
are on this side tomorrow."</p>

<p>I stood dumfounded in my trench coat and khaki uniform. Mary
coughed. We were an hour's boat journey away from headquarters and our
bags.</p>

<p>"I have a lovely fire in your bedroom. We shall be so disappointed
if you don't stay."</p>

<p>The thought of a bedroom with a fire in it, even just to look at,
was bliss, so I accepted the invitation to dinner. However, Mary and I
used the Malsetta bathroom, sat by the fire in the bedroom, and then
went downstairs.</p>

<p>We went in to dinner&mdash;all very grand, with menservants to wait
on us, and we had delicious fresh-caught salmon. It was getting late,
and I began to look questioningly at Mary. We had to drive ten miles to
the show and I had to make up. My mind was wandering, and in my
abstraction I refused the port. The steward filled my wineglass with
water; then I realized too late we were about to toast the King!</p>

<p>I stood with the commander of the Fleet and drank the toast to His
Majesty <i>in water</i>, and felt like some miserable figure in a
Bateman drawing!</p>

<br>


<p>For upward of ten days we did the Orkneys, putting on shows aboard
ships like H.M.S. <i>Dundas Castle</i>, which was a ghost ship of the
good old days of pleasure cruises. The <i>Dundas Castle</i> used to
sail to Africa with tourists and pass&Atilde;&copy; actors making
farewell tours. She was about to be broken up for scrap in 1938 when
the Navy took her over and remodeled her into the maid-of-all-work to
the Fleet.</p>

<p>Her engineers repair the ships that put in for repairs. Her dentist,
Dr. Gamble, fills all the aching cavities that come his way. Officers
awaiting leave, or returning from leave, are quartered aboard her until
they can rejoin their own ships. She handles all the mail for the Fleet
in Scapa Flow. Her theater, down in her bowels, far below sea level,
has to be seen to be believed. You go down a million stairs and
suddenly come upon an auditorium with red plush tip-up seats, a real
stage, and good dressing rooms. All these were part of the cinema which
was the attraction of B deck when the <i>Castle</i> was a
pleasure-cruise ship.</p>

<p>On our last day at work in the Orkneys we left by drifter for the
island of Shapinsay to do our last show for the Navy. There were only
about three hundred men and two officers in the camp, and most of them
had been there without leave for a long time. Shapinsay is much too
small and too remote&mdash;though terribly important in the chain of
defenses&mdash;to be on the list for E.N.S.A. shows to visit. Ours was
the first star unit to go there. All the villagers and their children
were admitted to the show.</p>

<p>When we left Shapinsay around five-thirty in the afternoon, we
cajoled the skipper into giving us a long-way-round trip home to our
billets in Kirkwall. None of us looked forward with any eagerness to
another night on a NAAFI cot, such as we had been sleeping on in the
hostels. The prevailing knobbiness of the thin mattresses made one feel
one was curled up on a sack of coals.</p>

<p>We had been invited to spend our last evening in the sergeants' mess
at Kirkwall, and we all looked forward to a rousing good time. On the
way there I was asked to drop in to see the new Arts Club, which had
been opened in the town. When we drove round, there was a group of
people waiting by the door. A naval officer detached himself from the
group to greet us and escort us inside, where I found myself suddenly
standing beside a grand piano and heard the officer announce: "And now
it gives me great pleasure to present Miss Gertrude Lawrence, the
celebrated stage and film star."</p>

<p>To my horror, I saw a room vaguely filled with elderly women, young
girls, and a few shy naval officers. One very mannish-looking female
had a hearing device placed on the table before her, connected by a
long cord to her ear which, presumably, wired her for sound.</p>

<p>I stood there in the midst of this truly Noel Coward setting and
said: "Thank you so much," and was about to sit down when the Navy man
whispered, "What shall I announce you are going to sing?"</p>

<p>I was trapped. I had not suspected the reason of our visit to the
Arts Club, and my pianist had no music with him. However, he went to
the piano and played a few chords and I sang "I Wanna Get Married."
This drew repressed giggles from the girls and frozen silence from the
older listeners. The female who reminded me of a Helen Hokinson
drawing, however, seemed delirious with joy. This led me to wonder if
she was the only human being in the club or if her ear gadget had not
been tuned in and she was merely trying to be polite, not having heard
a naughty word.</p>

<p>After the song I sat down, feeling that I was awaiting sentence.
Then Stanley was invited to play. He was very angry, but his humor rose
above his wrath, so he played with a great deal of bravado and many
sour notes.</p>

<p>After the tepid applause, someone said: "Let's have some choruses."
Stanley obliged again, and our audience sang them in a refined,
having-a-hell-of-a-time, let's-all-be-devils sort of way.</p>

<p>After this we left, but not until the three naval officers had come
up and apologized because the club had no bar. We said it was quite all
right and that the club was charming and that we didn't drink anyway,
so we left.</p>

<p>Well, the sergeants' mess, when we arrived there, liberally made up
for this deficiency. We had an impromptu show which ended in a supper
of large plates of fresh shellfish and beer.</p>

<p>When the barkeep showed signs of wearying, I offered to take his
place.</p>

<p>"This is a ticklish sort of job," he said, trying to put me off.</p>

<p>"Let me show you how well I can do it," I begged him.</p>

<p>He agreed to this, and let me draw a couple of mugs.</p>

<p>"I must sye, you do very well for a hamachoor."</p>

<p>"Amateur nothing, Sergeant! I was a barmaid myself once. Earned my
keep at it, too, for several weeks. And built up custom too."</p>

<p>The barkeep gave me a look which could be interpreted as "The hell
you were!" But he said with an effort toward politeness, "Maybe in a
play, in the theayter."</p>

<p>"Not in a theater; at the Red Lion Hotel in Shrewsbury."</p>

<p>To him I was a star, and, like most simple folk, he probably thought
I always had been.</p>

<p>It was quite true, that bit about my having been a barmaid. It came
about in this way: One of the touring companies I was playing in,
before I had my chance in <i>Andr&Atilde;&copy; Charlot's Revue</i>,
played Shrewsbury. Three of us girls put up at the Red Lion, which gave
special rates to theatricals. Shrewsbury is a busy county town, and the
Shropshire farmers who drove in on market day had a way of dropping
into the Lion for a glass of Shrewsbury ale. They were not amiss to
getting a glimpse of a pretty face, a mass of curves, and a winning
smile along with their drinks.</p>

<p>Our company manager at the time was a little man with a strawberry
nose and very thick lenses. We all called him "Old Four Eyes."</p>

<p>Anything could happen in such tacky little shows in those days, but
we were not prepared for what was in store for us this time. Saturday
came and we played the matinee and waited for the manager to appear
with the salaries. But "Old Four Eyes" had flown the coop with the
takings.</p>

<p>We three girls returned gloomily to the Red Lion and discussed what
was to be done. As usual, we had very little money between us. I had
not enough to pay my week's lodging at the inn. As I thought of my
wardrobe, which consisted chiefly of props, I put far from me the idea
that I could pawn any of it for sufficient money to take me back to
London to hunt a new job.</p>

<p>The other girls were more solvent than I. They were able to pay what
they owed at the Lion. One of them had enough money to take her to
London. The other, Myrtle, had a sister married to a stationer in
Birmingham and near enough to be a refuge during this emergency.</p>

<p>"Not that I shall be welcome," Myrtle said. "Her old man never did
cotton to me. It was one of those marriages. Percy's family are highly
respectable, I'd have you know, and what <i>they</i> think of
theatricals isn't fit for any girl's ears."</p>

<p>"How are you going to explain to them when you arrive?" I wanted to
know.</p>

<p>Myrtle gave me a wink over her plump, bare shoulder. "Trust Sis and
me. We'll think of something to tell Percy. Later I'll get to London
somehow."</p>

<p>As far as I could see, I would have to remain in
Shrewsbury&mdash;alone and on my own. At least until something turned
up for me somewhere. The Theatre Royal in Shrewsbury was a place on the
regular route of many of the companies which played the provinces and,
not infrequently, as I knew, a company on tour counted on picking up
someone to fill a minor part in each town they played. This arrangement
was usually cheaper than carrying a regular performer for the part, and
it brought business, because all the girl's family and friends would
come to see her. Perhaps some such stroke of luck would come my way if
I waited long enough. But, in the meanwhile, there were my expenses at
the inn. I was puzzling over a way of meeting these when Myrtle turned
around from her mirror.</p>

<p>"I don't like leaving you here, kiddo," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll be all right," I hastened to assure her. "I have a
plan."</p>

<p>And I had. The idea had come to me as an inspiration. I refused to
tell Myrtle, but my repeated assurance that I was not altogether
without resources cheered her tremendously.</p>

<p>I went downstairs next morning and asked to see the proprietor of
the Red Lion. I was under no necessity to explain to him what had
happened to our company, for he knew. To him I appealed with disarming
candor. I was stony, and I was not denying it. I owed his inn in the
neighborhood of twenty-seven shillings; but, I hastened to assure him,
I would welcome the chance to pay the indebtedness by working.</p>

<p>"What can you do?"</p>

<p>"I could work in the bar."</p>

<p>His eye went over my head in the direction of the tap-room where his
regular barmaid, a large, blowzy girl,
named&mdash;ironically&mdash;Tina, was lazily polishing glasses. From
Tina the landlord's eye came back to rest on me.</p>

<p>"I could do with another girl in the bar," he said thoughtfully.
"The only difficulty is..."</p>

<p>"I know," I said quickly. "Tina."</p>

<p>He nodded. "Tina's a good girl. She's been with me three years.
She's a cousin of my wife's. Knows all the steady customers and what
each one of them likes. Can give 'em back as good as they give her
too."</p>

<p>"Suppose you leave Tina to me," I suggested. "She'll understand I'm
not here to take her job away from her&mdash;only to help her through
the busy season."</p>

<p>That bit about the busy season was carefully planted. It was August,
and the annual Shrewsbury Floral and Musical Fete was scheduled for
Wednesday and Thursday of the following week.</p>

<p>In the end, the landlord took me on. He led me up to Tina and
announced with bluff good humor that, in view of the warm weather and
the increased customers which the fete was sure to bring, he had
engaged me as her assistant. I ran upstairs and broke the news to the
girls. They came down and drank a glass of port on the house. Then they
left for their trains. I was now a barmaid.</p>

<p>At first Tina was inclined to be suspicious of me and my intentions.
It was a decided novelty for a chorus girl to turn barmaid, and Tina
could not believe that I was doing this without ulterior motives. I
made a clean breast to her of my situation, and because she was
kindhearted she laid aside her original suspicions. Generously she lent
me a dozen kid curlers and showed me how to put up my hair on them so I
should have the mop of curls which used to be considered part of a
barmaid's make-up.</p>

<p>When I entertained her with tales of my experiences and anecdotes of
other actors and actresses&mdash;some of whom she had seen&mdash;she
became my friend. She even approved of my way of polishing the glasses
and shining the pewter beer taps. After two days she let me do all of
it. In return, she taught me how to draw a full, yet not overflowing,
glass of beer. This, as the barkeep at the sergeants' mess at Kirkwall
was to tell me many years later, is something no amateur can do. Thanks
to Tina&mdash;and the busy season in Shrewsbury&mdash;I am a
professional at it.</p>

<p>I was a success as a barmaid, if I do say it. The regular
customers&mdash;the commercial travelers, farmers, and tradesmen from
the shops&mdash;seemed to welcome the novelty of a new barmaid who sang
as she drew them a drop of what they fancied. Business at the Red Lion
was brisk. What with my wages and tips I paid off my debt to the
landlord and managed to set aside something to stand me in good stead
when my opportunity came. It came, ultimately, with a company which
opened at the Shrewsbury Theatre in a dramatic play called <i>The
Rosary</i>. The management wanted a local girl and, thanks to my
success in the bar at the Lion, the manager had not been in town an
hour before he was told by someone to stop round at our place, have a
glass of dark and bitter, and look me over. I was engaged to dress as a
nun and sing the song "My Rosary" as a prologue to the play to give it
"atmosphere"!</p>

<p>My return to the profession was celebrated in the tap-room of the
Lion, and the manager was congratulated on his choice. Though the
annual fete was over, our customers did not fall off, for the simple
reason that a number of citizens and quite a few of the masters and
boys from Shrewsbury's celebrated public school came there on the
chance of being served by the girl they had just seen in the play at
the theater. This might have turned the tide of my fortunes in such a
direction that I would have remained behind bars all my life, but
fortunately for me the publicity worked as well in the opposite
direction. People came to the theater in order to see the nun who was
barmaid at the Red Lion.</p>

<p>When the company left Shrewsbury for its next stand, I paid my bill
at the Red Lion and returned to London, the Cats' Home, and the casting
offices. It is a matter of pride to me that the landlord remarked on
our parting, "Gertie, you can have a job here in my bar any time."</p>

<p>I think everyone felt a little sad when it came time to fly away
from the Orkneys.</p>

<p>We arrived at Donnibristle in time for tea&mdash;three planes
full&mdash;including trunks, drums, double basses, and
Zo&Atilde;&laquo; May was scared during the flight, which we made in
wonderful weather, but everyone came through without mishap until just
before landing, when Harry, the saxophone player, was suddenly sick
from sheer relief that the flight was over.</p>

<p>We put on a show for the Fleet Air Arm at seven-thirty, then caught
the ten-thirty ferry across the Forth and slept that night at Hawes's
Inn, under the shadow of the famous bridge and the eagle eyes of the
M.P.s. As a rule, no one was allowed to break a journey at this point,
either going in or out of Edinburgh, as one attempt was made by the
Germans to destroy the bridge, and the area was under heavy guard.
Since we were traveling under military orders, an exception was made
for us.</p>

<p>Our next stop was in a small Cumberland village, and was occasioned
by no less a demand than our hunger for the fish and chips we smelled
frying in a little shop. Four of us sat on the running board of the
truck and ate that greatest of all English delicacies out of newspaper.
It was the first time I had had that treat of my childhood in many
years and I found my appetite for it undiminished.</p>

<p>Mary told us a true story of a five-months-old baby who was brought
into one of the London day nurseries. The family had not had a drop of
milk for many weeks. Asked how they had managed to feed the baby, the
mother replied: "We gave her a little bit of whatever we had."</p>

<p>What they had was principally fish and chips, washed down by strong
tea. The fact that the baby had survived this diet would seem to prove
that forty-eight million Britishers can't be wrong.</p>

<p>Our first job in Manchester, at nine-thirty next morning, was to
rehearse for a monster broadcast from Belle Vue, the amusement park. I
worked all day, broke long enough to have my picture taken riding Lil,
the elephant, and another in a hair-raising roundabout known as the
Caterpillar. The last time I did that stunt was in 1937 with Douglas,
now Lieutenant Commander, Fairbanks.</p>

<p>The crowd at the broadcast was enormous&mdash;eight thousand
servicemen present, and very thrilling.</p>

<p>Basil Dean came down from London for the show, recalling to me the
fact that the first time I ever played in Manchester was under his
direction. He introduced me with words that gave me a shock: "Miss
Gertrude Lawrence, who is now on her way to Normandy."</p>

<p>Basil had just returned from Bayeux, where he had been making plans
to send the first E.N.S.A. units into France.</p>

<p>This was my first official notice that I was to be allowed to go
across to the invasion front, for which we had seen so many men set
out. It was what I had hoped for, begged for, worked for&mdash;the
opportunity to entertain the fighting men at the actual front.</p>

<p>At that moment I was glad of every springless, lumpy camp bed I had
stretched my weary bones upon. It had all been our basic training.</p>

<p>We signed our papers before we left Manchester and received our
orders to proceed to London for inoculations as soon as our tour
ended&mdash;in less than a week.</p>

<p>During the next six days we literally raced across England, doing
shows for the Navy and the Air Force and the WAAFS. At St. Nathan's
Camp, near Cardiff, twenty-four hundred airmen and WAAFS packed
themselves into a theater only big enough to hold fourteen hundred. The
audience was, literally, two deep. St. Nathan's, I was told, was the
largest air-training camp in the world, with a personnel of forty
thousand. Our unit would have had to stay there a week and give two
shows a day to entertain that audience.</p>

<p>We ran on south into the invasion area and all the bustle and
turmoil again. The sky above us was full of planes, bearing other
glider planes with air-borne troops, towed by the famous nylon-stocking
line. The roads were jammed with trucks and tanks and soldiers of all
the services&mdash;literally millions of men and mountains of
ammunition&mdash;all headed one way-to France.</p>

<p>So we came at last to Salisbury in the shadow of the famous
cathedral, which was still intact and strangely serene in the martial
atmosphere that filled the old town. We did a show for the Army at Lark
Hill Camp. Our last two shows in this area, under canvas at Bustard
Camp and for the R.A.F. at Keevil, gave me a taste of what I was told I
could expect across the Channel. Our stage was improvised out of
kitchen tables, and the lighting was done with hastily rigged kerosene
lamps. Afterward, in the mess where we were given supper, the rats came
out and eyed us hungrily as we gobbled our Spam and salad before they
could get it away from us. At Keevil, though the theater was very much
better and the mess had a well-stocked bar, the mess table swarmed with
earwigs. In France, I was told, we would have dust and mosquitoes as
well as all the forms of vermin known to man.</p>

<p>In Salisbury, Richard was able to join me for a few hours' leave.
After all, he was then based only forty minutes away. We had so much to
talk over, so many things to tell each other, as we strolled about the
cathedral close. It was my last chance to see him before going to
Normandy.</p>

<p>From the window of one of the ATS billets sounded a concertina,
evidently being played by someone new to the art. "I'm dreaming of a
white Christmas," wheezed the concertina. And four or five American
G.I.s who were walking about, viewing the cathedral, grinned and
started to whistle the song to help the concertina player. An elderly
clergyman in a violet cassock, passing along a path to choir practice,
looked first distressed at this invasion of the sanctity of the
cloisters, then smiled benignly.</p>

<p>A lot of things were changing. Much of the England I had known and
loved and had belonged to was gone. I had thought so many times, in the
course of those five thousand miles which had taken me from Portsmouth
to John o' Groats and back again. There was a house which once had been
mine, a blackened mass of rubble with the wild grasses already claiming
it for a ruin. There were the towns I had known and played in when they
were thriving and intact, now maimed and disfigured. There were friends
one asked about only to be told quietly, "Killed."</p>

<p>But all the changes were not sorrowful ones like these. Some, like
the look on the priest's face when he smiled at the G.I.s, promised
well for the future.</p>

<p>I said a little of this to Richard, and he agreed with me. Then we
went on to talk of some of the many things which meant so much to both
of us. Like so many husbands and wives in these wartimes, we had so
little time. There was no knowing when or where&mdash;or even
if&mdash;we would meet again.</p>

<p>After Richard left to return to duty and I packed up for the trip
back to London to get ready for my trip to Normandy, my mind was full
of the changes I could feel as well as see taking place on every side.
I remembered how, as a child, I had thought of the world as very
stable. Even boringly so. All the adventures, so I thought, had been
had by others long ago. The grown-up people I observed seemed to live
in a cut-and-dried world. They were already settled in life. In my
heart of hearts I dreaded the time when this would happen to me. Yet
people used to talk about "settling down" as though this were something
every nice girl should wish to do.</p>

<p>Well, perhaps I'm not a nice girl. One reason why I have always
loved the theater and why I'm still stage struck is that this sort of
life offers variety, constant change, even dangerous and thrilling
"ups" and "downs."</p>

<p>At heart I have always been an adventurer. The Danish strain in my
blood makes me restless. I am a seeker, not a holder. I am filled with
urgent curiosity about what may lie just around the corner.</p>

<p>During my illness in the hospital in Toronto and then throughout my
prolonged convalescence, when it was bliss just to be alive with Philip
in the sunshine, sometimes, even in the midst of my happiness, a
chilling thought would strike me. Suppose this is the climax. The
ultimate high moment. This is perfection. What more can life give
me?</p>

<p>And even in the sunshine I would shiver slightly.</p>

<p>Philip was not given to introspection. He believed in taking life
and people as he found them. And he found them good and fair to see. I
never felt that he understood me particularly. Maybe I was too young to
be very convincing. He had certain ideas about me which, put together,
composed a personality, and he was in love with that. We never talked
about our feelings. If I ever felt moved to tell him how I felt about
life, the impulse withered immediately when I thought how Philip, with
his social background, would receive such revelations. I knew it would
have embarrassed him.</p>

<p>We were having lunch in the dark and dreary dining room of one of
Cherbourg's small hotels while waiting for word that the
<i>Aquitania</i> was coming into port. Our holiday was over. I was both
sad and glad&mdash;sad because Philip and I had had such a happy time
together. It could never be quite the same again. And I was glad, too,
as Philip said, "Because you are going back to your job, Dormouse. I
believe the theater means more to you than I do."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>I said it, mimicking his accent, to make him smile. And he did. But
inwardly I was wondering&mdash;as I did at times&mdash;if Philip was
right about this. Perhaps he did know me better than I then knew
myself.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h2 id="chapter16">16</h2>

<br>


<p>The popularity of <i>Charlot's Revue</i> in America increased the
excitement and the warmth of our reception when we reopened in London
in the early spring of 1925. There was so great a demand for seats for
the premi&Atilde;&uml;re that Charlot adopted the unique and daring
plan of giving two performances&mdash;one at 8:00 P.M., the other at
midnight.</p>

<p>Never was such an audience assembled in the theater as at that
second performance. Celebrities of society and stage crowded the
building from stall and dress circle to the boxes, and even the gallery
and pit.</p>

<p>It was the same show in general that we had played in New York, and
many of the numbers had been seen many times in London, but it seemed
as though everybody wanted to see the familiar acts all over again.</p>

<p>Perhaps there was some curiosity as to whether playing to American
audiences for so long a run had changed Bea Lillie's or my style. Bea
was very much in the news because her husband, Bobby Peel, whom she had
married in 1922, had just succeeded to the baronetcy. As Lady Peel, Bea
was an even greater hit than ever simply because she remained the same
unspoiled Bea Lillie.</p>

<p>The Guv'nor, as we used to call Charlot, was always warning us that
no artist can afford to rest on his laurels until he is dead. He kept
reminding us that he had not brought the company back to London merely
to ride along indefinitely on the successes it had piled up in New
York. He was determined to make the return of his revue the high spot
of the season.</p>

<p>Bea and I injected into the Revue our joint impressions of the
typical "sister act" which we had seen in America. This included a
burlesque by Bea of Fanny Brice, and I did an imitation of Sophie
Tucker, who was then enormously popular in London. For this act, Bea
and I dressed alike, we played ukuleles, and of course we did close
harmony. We were known as the Sisters Apple&mdash;Seedy and Cora.</p>

<p>One June night that season the after-theater crowds passing along
Regent Street noticed a large car stop in front of a "His Master's
Voice" gramophone shop. The driver emerged from the car. After entering
the shop, he returned with a porter in a green felt apron. The two men
approached the car and the passers-by stopped and stared in horrified
amazement to see the porter reach into the back seat of the car and,
after a considerable struggle, bring out the body of a woman whose
quaint crooked smile advertised her as Miss Beatrice Lillie of
<i>Charlot's Revue!</i> As her gold-clad feet hung limp at one end and
her arms were outstretched at the other, she did not seem in any
condition to resist her captor. Her smile remained unperturbed and
sweet as it faced the public over his brawny shoulder. He gently but
hurriedly carried her into the shop. The crowd increased as word ran up
and down the street that some queer happenings were going on. Once more
the porter emerged. Again he dived into the car and came out with still
another woman thrown carelessly across his shoulder. Someone said, "My
God, it looks like Gertrude Lawrence!" The woman's legs kicked and her
hands beat a helpless tattoo on his back, but the porter's powerful
arms were folded tight across her rump. So finally he carried the two
figures in and they stood side by side in all their gold-sequined glory
as an advertisement for gramophone records.</p>

<p>"Blimey," someone in the crowd said. "They're dummies!"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. It's them."</p>

<p>The crowd argued and increased. Charlot had learned the power of
advertising methods in the U.S.A.</p>

<p><i>Charlot's Revue</i> ran for many months and then closed. Several
months later Charlot had an offer to prepare another revue for New
York, so he gathered his original company around him&mdash;Jack, Bea,
and me.</p>

<p>Again we set sail for America&mdash;on the <i>Caronia</i>. Bea was
accompanied by her husband, Bobby Peel, who was immediately surrounded
by the press and was hard put to explain: first, that he was not a
member of the company; second, that he was not connected with the
London police force&mdash;the "Peelers," as they are nicknamed for
Bobby's grandfather, who organized them; third, that he was no relation
to "Do Ye Ken John Peel?"</p>

<p>When we opened in New York, Noel Coward was playing there in <i>The
Vortex</i>. Our first night was very heartwarming&mdash;all the crowd
turned up and Uncle Aleck Woollcott wrote in his column the next day,
"It was not a performance&mdash;it was a reunion."</p>

<p>We had a good show. Bea sang "There's Life in the Old Girl Yet."
Gertrude Ederle had just swum the Channel, and Bea did a burlesque of
that muscular lady which was hilarious. We did our "Fallen Babies" song
dressed as one-year-olds, in huge baby carriages&mdash;ending up with
getting tipsy from the gin in the feeding bottles belonging to our
absent nursemaids. I sang "Carrie Was a Careful Girl" and "Parisienne
Pierrot," both written by Noel. Jack, as always, was excellent, but for
some reason the gilt was missing from the gingerbread. We ran only six
months in New York and after a short tour we arrived in Hollywood. For
three weeks the town was ours.</p>

<p>On the closing night we gradually noticed that all the Hollywood
male stars in the orchestra seats were leaving before the finale. This
worried us terribly; we couldn't understand such behavior! Well, Jack
went on in his full Highland costume and sang the opening of the last
song; I followed dressed as Flora MacDonald; and then came Bea as
Bonnie Prince Charlie. By this time there wasn't a single Hollywood
male star left out front. We all sang bravely and laughed gaily, trying
to carry off our dismay, when suddenly one by one onto the stage came
the missing males.</p>

<p>They all had their trousers rolled up to their knees; Valentino had
on a Scotch headdress borrowed from the chorus girls; Charlie Chaplin
had his dinner coat tied round his waist like a kilt; Richard
Barthelmess had a tam o' shanter on; the Marx Brothers wore red beards;
Jack Gilbert carried a ladder, for what reason no one knew. They took
over the whole finale with us; they made speeches; and Chaplin, who at
that time was refusing to make "talkies," made his speech in dumb show.
Oh, what a night!</p>

<p>Bea stayed on in Hollywood for a while; she had signed on to appear
in New York in September in a musical farce which Jerome Kern wrote for
her. I, too, had made my decision to leave Charlot's management and
accept a New York contract. That was to be <i>Oh, Kay!</i> produced by
Alex Aarons and Vinton Freedley. George Gershwin was writing the music
especially for me; and his brother, Ira, the lyrics. The book was by P.
G. Wodehouse and Guy Bolton. Rehearsals were to begin in New York early
in October, so I had time for only a brief holiday in England.</p>

<p>I caused some consternation when the press photographers caught me
going aboard the <i>Mauretania</i> on a blistering August day with bare
legs. I had experimented going stockingless in California and found it
comfortable and economical.</p>

<p>As soon as it was reported that Gertrude Lawrence was going about
barelegged, the papers began to interview fashion experts and other
actresses to get their opinion of the fad I had started. Marilyn
Miller, when interviewed, expressed ladylike disapproval of the
innovation, and announced that she had brought back from Paris two
hundred pairs of silk stockings which she had every intention of
wearing. Miss Carmel Snow, fashion editor of <i>Vogue</i>, was quoted
as exclaiming with horror: "The idea is disgusting. It will never be
done by nice people."</p>

<p>Pam came back with me when I returned to New York from England. My
little daughter was a surprise to the American press, as I had never
allowed her to be publicized or photographed for the illustrated
papers. I wanted to keep Pam's life simple and sheltered, with no
searchlights turned on her. I wanted her to grow up a normal, wholesome
little girl and without contact with the theater. If she wanted to go
on the stage later on, and showed an aptitude for it, that would be
time enough to introduce her to the world in which I spent so much of
my life.</p>

<p><i>Oh, Kay!</i> opened in November and was a tremendous success.
Gershwin's score was Gershwin at his sprightliest. The piece had lots
of humor and that indefinable something which can only be described as
spirit. Oscar Shaw played the lead, and Victor Moore provided most of
the uproarious comedy.</p>

<p>It was that winter, my third in New York and during the run of Oh,
Kay! that I met Bert Taylor, and immediately my life changed. This
tall, dark-haired, stunning-looking American was like someone one only
reads about. With a snap of his fingers, a glance, a quiet word, he had
the power to bring about miracles. Bert had been born with a gold spoon
in his mouth. His father was president of the New York Stock Exchange,
and Bert had rolled up an enormous fortune of his own during those
years when Wall Street was holding carnival.</p>

<p>Bert Taylor figuratively knocked me off my feet. From the moment of
his entry into my life I began to live in a storybook world. While New
York streets were glazed with ice and the sky sent down showers of
sleet, my apartment was abloom with spring and the fragrance of
American beauties.</p>

<p>A banker in Bert Taylor's position could, and not infrequently did,
make a profit of fifty thousand dollars in a day's trading on the Stock
Exchange; and, exhilarated by this achievement, on his way uptown to
his club he would drop in at Cartier's and spend a part of the day's
bag on a gorgeous bauble to please the lady of his heart.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that Bert Taylor, who moved habitually in this
fantastically luxurious world, should have swept me off my feet? Philip
and I were extraordinarily companionable. His devotion and attention to
me had brought me great happiness. But from the start of our friendship
both of us had known, and had admitted frankly, that we had no future
together. Circumstances to which we both had to submit kept us apart.
For several years I was content with half a loaf, but, as inevitably
happens, the disappointment ultimately bred a restlessness. That, I
really believe, was one reason why I wanted to stay on in America; and
why I did stay on. It was no longer happiness enough just to be with
Philip knowing that we could never marry and have a life together. I
carried back with me to America a loneliness. Undoubtedly this made me
even more susceptible than I would otherwise have been to Bert's great
charm and to the attention he paid me.</p>

<p>I wrote Philip that I was seeing a lot of this young American.
Philip and I had always been honest with each other. We were really and
truly friends. Sooner or later he would have heard about Bert Taylor
and me anyway. There were Americans constantly going over to London and
to the Riviera and to St. Moritz for the winter sports, and many of
Philip's friends came to New York. Bert's sister, the Countess de
Frasso, was a well-known figure in the international set whose members
floated from Santa Barbara to C&Atilde;&acute;te d'Azur, from New York
to the Lido, and from Salzburg to Palm Beach.</p>

<p>When it was evident that <i>Oh, Kay!</i> was destined to stay on
Broadway for many months, Philip cabled me that he was coming over to
New York for a visit. And he did. In New York that winter for the first
time he asked me to marry him. If he had only done so two years before
I am sure I would have said "yes," and would have immediately gone
about the business of getting a divorce from Frank.</p>

<p>Oh, I did not blame him. His career was as important as mine, and it
would have been wrecked had he married a divorced woman. Though I was
his wife, he could not have brought me to Court, since etiquette
forbade this. He could not have entered the royal enclosure at
Ascot&mdash;something which may seem petty to Americans but which is
extremely important to English people of Philip's position, not merely
for what it is, but for what it represents.</p>

<p>If I had been only an actress, we might have overcome some of the
opposition, especially if I had abandoned my career and retired to
Philip's house in the country. But I was not prepared to do
this&mdash;not now. I belonged to the theater. My life, since I was
ten, had been lived in it. The public had been kind to me and I owed
them loyalty in return. Philip's income was not sufficient to pay the
heavy expenses of his clubs, his uniforms, and all the obligations
connected with his career in court circles and to support me and a
growing daughter.</p>

<p>No, from whatever angle you considered it, marriage with Philip
Astley was impossible.</p>

<p>So I said, "No, darling," when Philip asked me to marry him. Philip
took the next boat back to England, and I went on with my job.</p>

<p>I sent for Mother. She arrived after "a beastly crossing, the worst
in forty years. Even the captain was sick."</p>

<p>I had a beautiful apartment on Park Avenue with everything to give
Mother a taste of American comfort and luxury. But she refused to
approve of any of it. She complained that Pam had become too
American.</p>

<p>From the beginning the idea was a mistake. Mother liked the
apartment but it was too high up&mdash;it frightened her. She liked
Bert, but she kept talking about Philip; she hated the cold weather,
but she couldn't stand the steam heat. She liked her new clothes, but
she couldn't understand Americans, and she never went out because the
traffic all went the wrong way!</p>

<p>However, after a while she got more settled. Then she missed and
worried about Dad. So when the good weather came, she went back to
England. We hadn't discussed anything!</p>

<p>Once back home, people wrote me that she never stopped comparing the
living conditions of London with New York; and the moment anything went
wrong she would say, "Of course over in America everything is so
different, and the central heating is <i>marvelous!</i>"</p>

<p>That summer I played <i>Oh, Kay!</i> in London and continued the
fantastic existence I had entered upon in New York. Several Indian
princes from Hyderabad with their entourages were at the Savoy and came
to see our play. They adored it. The Gershwin score and the English
company were excellent. The princes proceeded to show their enthusiasm
by taking a box for the season. Occasionally the box would be occupied
by several ladies in Indian dress, with their caste marks on their
foreheads, precious stones on the sides of their nostrils, and
beautiful long saris draped over their heads, swinging gracefully from
their bejeweled shoulder pins.</p>

<p>The youngest prince took a fancy to me. We called him "Baby" because
his own names were so many and so difficult to remember. Baby was
enraptured by every sort of mechanical gadget and presented me with a
cigarette lighter shaped like an airplane, and a miniature cannon which
fired a lighted cigar. He bought dozens of such things to take home
with him to adorn the palace at Hyderabad, where he invited me to visit
him. He presented me with a very large photograph of himself on a very
small polo pony. Before going back to India the princes gave a banquet
at the Savoy. It was all very sumptuous, and at every lady's place was
a small gold kidskin bag.</p>

<p>I picked up mine. My fingers told me that inside were several small,
round hard objects. "Ah!" I thought. "This is it! Nothing less than
emeralds. Or pigeon-blood rubies." I shot Baby a questioning glance. He
was beaming, confident of the great pleasure he was giving me.</p>

<p>"It is something you ladies like very much," he said. "I hope you
like&mdash;"</p>

<p>I pulled the drawstring. Out into my expectant palm tumbled a
handful of the betel nuts Indian women chew to blacken their teeth and
gums.</p>

<p>I then and there decided not to visit Hyderabad.</p>

<p>George Gershwin was in London for the opening of <i>Oh, Kay!</i> and
was lionized by English society. He gave concerts, he raised money for
charities, he visited every famous "stately home of England," yet he
remained the same serious, hard-working young man. He bought suits in
Savile Row and took me along to the fittings and to select his shirts
and ties at Hawes and Curtis's, and hats at Scott's. But he never lost
his head size.</p>

<p>His one interest in life was his music. Before he returned to New
York he visited France and wrote his famous "American in Paris"
concerto.</p>

<p>I had leased a flat in Portland Place from the Marquis de Casa Maury
and intended to make it my permanent home. Pam entered school at
Roedean in Sussex. The flat was beautiful and I loved it. Sybil Colfax
redecorated it for me. I had one of the first rooms in London to be
done in mirrors, and a white drawing room with silver sequin curtains.
I had gradually collected some fine old Bristol glass and some
pictures, including a Gauguin. Also many photographs and bibelots.
Among these was a charcoal drawing of an animal which was intended to
be a pig, though it looked slightly like a rhino, and from another
angle like a badger. It might have passed for one of Thurber's
creations, but it was the work of the Prince of Wales, who drew it
blindfolded, as a stunt at a charity bazaar, and presented it to
me.</p>

<p>I didn't <i>buy</i> a Bentley car. I had one built. I took the
Bentley to America with me when I returned late in the summer, on the
same boat with George and Ira Gershwin, to start rehearsals for their
new musical, <i>Treasure Girl</i>. I also took the very smallest baby
Austin I could buy. I remember driving the Austin up Fifth Avenue one
day and being stopped by a red light. The cop left his post in the
center of traffic to come over and lean his elbows on the radiator.</p>

<p>"Say, lady," he remarked confidentially, "what do you do with it at
night? Keep it under the bed?"</p>

<p>Clifton Webb and Walter Catlett played in <i>Treasure Girl</i> with
me, but the show was not the success <i>Oh, Kay!</i> had been. I had
one song which went over big, "Where's the Boy?"</p>

<p>All that winter and through the summer after <i>Treasure Girl</i>
closed and I stayed on in New York to make a picture at Paramount's
Long Island studios, I continued to see a great deal of Bert Taylor.
Before coming to America, I had applied for my divorce, and the court
had granted it, though under the British law the decree did not become
absolute until six months had passed. Bert and I were engaged. He had
come to London to see me while I was playing in <i>Oh, Kay!</i>, had
proposed, and I had accepted him.</p>

<p>I was deeply happy; everything seemed to be coming my way. I was
riding on the crest of the wave.</p>

<p>Gilbert Miller had signed me to co-star in <i>Candle-Light</i> with
Leslie Howard and Reginald Owen. We were to open at the Empire Theatre
in New York in the autumn of 1929. The play was a Viennese comedy by
Siegfried Geyer, and had been adapted by P. G. Wodehouse, who had done
so much toward the success of <i>Oh, Kay!</i> <i>Candle-Light</i> had
been produced in London with Yvonne Arnaud in the leading role. It was
one of the first of many plays&mdash;tragic and comic&mdash;written
around the romantic figure of the Austrian Archduke Rudolf. Everyone
predicted it would be a huge success on Broadway.</p>

<p><i>Candle-Light</i> marked my first appearance in America in a
legitimate play, and I was both excited and terrified. On the first
night I had a cable from Noel, who was, as usual, going around the
world on a tramp steamer.</p>

<blockquote>LEGITIMATE AT LAST, DARLING. WON'T MOTHER BE
PLEASED?</blockquote>

<p>My pride knew no bounds when Gilbert Miller hung my portrait in the
Empire Theatre with those of Doris Keane, Helen Hayes, and Ina
Claire.</p>

<p>No one apparently, not even Bert, had any inkling that the autumn of
1929 was to be the end of an era.</p>

<p>I began to get the idea that money flowed in without restrictions or
with very little effort on my part. When I remembered how hard I had
worked to earn fifteen shillings a week just ten years back, it seemed
incredible that I should be earning thirty-five hundred dollars a week
in the theater. Not to mention my paper profits in the market. Of
course I had no idea of it at the time, but I was to be one of the
victims of the boom years. It was to be a long, hard time before I was
to acquire a realistic attitude toward money.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when I had gambled successfully in the, Street, I would
remember poor Dad and his pathetic, ever-hopeful efforts to back a
winner. He was still playing the horses. Mother shook her head over it,
but whenever I was in England Dad and I would get together. He would
confide to me his choice for the next Derby or the Manchester Handicap,
and prove to me that his horse was sure to win. We were partners. He
still considered Mother the most remarkable woman in the world. He
would tell me so and would impress the same on Pamela:</p>

<p>"Your grandmother's a fine woman. And don't you go forgetting it, my
girl!"</p>

<p>We opened in <i>Candle-Light</i> on the last night of September.
Leslie Howard was excellent as Joseph. I shall never forget his way of
replying to my question to the supposed archduke: "Do you, Prince
Rudolf, have many mistresses?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Baroness, they do pile up."</p>

<p>In the supper scene Leslie and I were supposed to drink rather
freely of the wine poured for us by the real archduke in the livery of
a servant. According to theatrical custom this was really weak, cold
tea and extremely nasty. It isn't easy to appear to enjoy drinking the
kind of concoction the property man supplies for a rare vintage. One
night I saw to it that the contents of the decanter were emptied and
the bottle refilled with some excellent dry sherry.</p>

<p>After his first drink, Leslie threw me a look of delighted surprise.
His acting took on added richness and flavor. And he tossed off his
wine instead of toying with his glass as he usually did.</p>

<p>As for myself, I felt that I was giving the best performance I had
ever given. I began to enjoy the supper scene. The archduke had to fill
and refill our glasses. There was more realism than acting in the close
of the scene in which Leslie and I became slightly spiffy.</p>

<p>Inevitably <i>Candle-Light</i> felt the impact of the crash that
shattered the bubble of prosperity which Americans&mdash;and New
Yorkers especially&mdash;had been playing with. But the play continued
to run with more than fair success. Perhaps people wanted amusement
that offered them an escape from their financial worries. They still
did not want to face the grim reality.</p>

<p>Bert was up to his ears in worries and responsibilities. In the
circumstances it seemed impractical for us to marry. At least Bert said
it was. I was free to marry him and I wanted to, just to prove that I
loved him and not his money.</p>

<p>But he said, "No, Peaches. I must fight this thing alone. I can't
afford to marry now."</p>

<p>He had called me "Peaches" since soon after we met, which was at a
time when the romance of a middle-aged gentleman named Daddy Browning
and an outsize young girl called Peaches figured in the news. Bert was
amused by the contrast my slim figure presented to the plump Peaches',
and he enjoyed my fury whenever he called me the absurd name.</p>

<p>But now I did not retort, "Don't call me that." I protested I was
willing to go on working to help things along financially. That only
hurt his pride more deeply. We were at a deadlock.</p>

<p>When <i>Candle-Light</i> closed I went into Lew Leslie's
<i>International Revue</i>, which had lyrics and music by Dorothy
Fields and Jimmy McHugh. The cast included Harry Richman, Jack Pearl,
and Anton Dolin, and, as the title implies, many continental and
foreign performers. They all dropped out, however, after a few weeks,
and only Jack, Pat Dolin, Harry, and I remained. You can imagine the
sort of life those three madmen led me backstage.</p>

<p>I had two excellent numbers in the revue, "Exactly Like You," and
"On the Sunny Side of the Street," that I sang with Harry Richman. But
though a lot of money had been spent on the show it did only fair
business. We closed in May. Andr&Atilde;&copy; Charlot had offered me a
contract to star in a new revue he was staging. The offer tempted me; I
was fond of the Guv'nor and owed him a great deal of my success.</p>

<p>It was always inspiring to work under the direction of this man of
whom Sir James Barrie once said: "There goes the whole theatrical
profession in a nutshell."</p>

<p>I signed the contract Charlot offered me. My plans for the next
season seemed set. Then two men who had figured prominently in
childhood years in the theater came back into my life.</p>

<br>
<br>
<center>
<h2 id="chapter17">17</h2>
</center>

<br>


<p>The two men were Charles B. Cochran and Noel Coward. They had a play
which Noel had written. It was called <i>Private Lives</i>.</p>

<p>Noel had written it in Burma or Peiping or somewhere in the course
of his travels in the Far East. But there was nothing oriental about
<i>Private Lives</i>. It was modern, British, and suavely
sophisticated.</p>

<p>When Noel's manager, Jack Wilson, brought me the script to read I
fell in love with it. I was determined that I&mdash;and only
I&mdash;should play Amanda, whose "heart was jagged with
sophistication." Noel was to play the male lead, of course.</p>

<p>Noel wrote <i>Private Lives</i> especially for me. It was his
fulfillment of a promise he had made to me and to himself when
<i>Bitter Sweet</i> was produced and I was unable to play it because of
my contract for <i>Candle-Light</i>. The part was given to Peggy Wood
instead of to me, and Noel had said:</p>

<p>"Never mind, darling. I'll write another play, especially for us,
that will be even better."</p>

<p>Now he had done it. But again I was under contract and did not know
whether I could get out of my agreement with Charlot.</p>

<p>I dashed off a cable to Noel to tell him how thrilled I was about
the new play. I am usually reckless about cables and send terribly
long, expensive ones. But for once I was having an economical streak,
so I worded the message briefly:</p>

<blockquote>PLAY DELIGHTFUL STOP NOTHING WRONG THAT CAN'T BE
FIXED</blockquote>

<p>What I meant was that the only hindrance was my contract with
Andr&Atilde;&copy; Charlot and that I was trying to get free of it,
which I finally succeeded in doing. But Noel took it to mean that his
pet play needed revisions. He was furious. The sputter of his wrath
lighted up the Pacific as he journeyed, and he scorched the cable wires
with scathing comments on my ability as critic and playwright.</p>

<p>We were right back at Miss Conti's squabbling over who should ride
the bicycle and who should play the phonograph.</p>

<p>He was still indignant when he caught up with me at Captain
Molyneux's villa at Cap d'Ail near Monte Carlo, which I and my friend
Helen Downes had rented for the summer. Noel never has entirely
forgiven me for that cable, and I don't think he has ever really
believed even to this day that I was not making an adverse comment on
his play.</p>

<p>We went over the play and rehearsed our scenes at the villa. Every
evening we arranged and rearranged the furniture in the drawing room
for a rehearsal. My other guests&mdash;among them G. B. Stern and
William Powell&mdash;wandered in and out, amused themselves as they
wished, and looked on Noel and me as on two quite pleasant but quite
mad creatures.</p>

<p>Noel, Charles Cochran, and I decided to go into partnership on the
play, so when we opened at the Phoenix Theatre it was:</p>

<center><i>C. C. L. Present</i><br>
<i>Noel Coward and Gertrude Lawrence</i><br>
<i>in</i><br>
PRIVATE LIVES<br>
<i>An Intimate Comedy</i><br>
<i>by</i><br>
NOEL COWARD</center>

<p>Noel had imbued me with the character of Amanda. In the cast with us
were Everley Gregg, Laurence Olivier, and Adrianne Allen (then Mrs.
Raymond Massey), and on the first night Noel gave me a specially bound
and initialed set of all his plays, including <i>Private Lives</i>,
which bore the dedication, "For Gertie, with my undying gratitude for
her exquisite, polished, and sensitive performance of Amanda. Noel,
1930."</p>

<p>Everyone remembers the success of Noel's <i>Private Lives</i>, but
we had our baby pains even with that for a brief moment. We have a very
strict censorship guiding the destiny of all plays presented in
England, and <i>Private Lives</i> had to pass the Lord Chamberlain's
critical eye. So in due course the play was sent to Lord Cromer at St.
James's Palace, and it came back with some criticism in regard to the
scene on the sofa!</p>

<p>Of course without that scene <i>Private Lives</i> would have been
like beef without mustard. We were all suddenly cast into the depths of
despair. So Noel betook himself to Lord Cromer with permission to
<i>read</i> the play.</p>

<p>Lord Cromer proved himself to be a man of great judgment in regard
to what can be delivered to the public and in taking into consideration
the manner in which the fare is served to them. So having enjoyed his
afternoon with Noel and the delicate and charming treatment of the
play, he gave us the green light, and not a word of Noel's script was
censored.</p>

<p>So we opened in Edinburgh for the tryout, and Charles Cochran wrote
me</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>...If there is another actress on the English stage who could
give the performance you did on Monday night in Edinburgh, l don't know
her. I am proud. I am happy&mdash;and I am grateful.</i></p>

<p><i>With affectionate regards, believe me, my Miracle Child,</i></p>

<p><i>Yours very sincerely,</i></p>

<p>CHARLES B. COCHRAN</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dear Charles Cochran. What a long time it was since I had been one
of his children in <i>The Miracle!</i></p>

<p>When we opened in London three weeks later, at the brand-new Phoenix
Theatre in Charing Cross Road, <i>Private Lives</i> was already a huge
success. The press made much of Noel. Lines from the play were quoted
by smart people. When I, as Amanda, observed of myself: "I don't think
I'm particularly complex, but I know I'm unreliable," hundreds of women
snatched the line as referring to themselves.</p>

<p>I also stored up future trouble for myself. Ever since I played
<i>Private Lives</i> people have been confusing me with the heroine of
Noel's play. They think I must be brittle, irresponsible, and have the
emotional stability of a shuttlecock.</p>

<p><i>Private Lives</i> ran three months in London, even though it
could have run much longer. Noel does not like long runs. We sailed on
New Year's Eve to open at the Times Square Theatre in New York early in
January 1931.</p>

<p>My clothes in the play were all made for me by Molyneux. He made me
beautiful things, and Amanda did justice to them.</p>

<p>When we came to New York I brought along a sufficient number of
dresses for use in the play to last six weeks. At the end of that
period Molyneux sent me an entirely new set which I wore during the
next six weeks. In this way my clothes were always fresh. And even
though they were copied, we never changed their design. They were part
and parcel of Amanda.</p>

<p>One of my properties was an extra-long cigarette holder, and this
Edgar Wallace supplied. He kept me in holders, all marked E.W., for the
run of the play.</p>

<p>I had expected Bert would meet me when we docked. But he did not. A
radiogram to the ship told me he was at Palm Beach. In a few days he
returned. When he did, I found him strangely different from the Bert
who had seen me off to England the previous spring. He was distrait. He
admitted he was terribly worried about the financial situation, which
had grown worse instead of better. America was tobogganing into a
depression, and no one, apparently, knew how to stop it. Like everyone
else, I had lost my paper profits and a lot more. But I still had my
work. <i>Private Lives</i> was repeating the success it had had in
London.</p>

<br>


<p>One day I was lunching with Bert and some friends on Long Island.
When we left the table I went into the powder room. I was seated in
front of the mirror, putting on my lipstick, when I became aware of
women's voices in the adjoining room.</p>

<p>"Did you see? That was Gertrude Lawrence."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she's back. She's with Bert Taylor."</p>

<p>There was a little ripple of laughter.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the other one will do, now that Gertrude's back."</p>

<p>"It will be interesting to see..."</p>

<p>The voices floated off. A door slammed. Silence.</p>

<p>I sat and stared at my reflection, which stared back at me. Who was
this "other one"? Was she the reason for the change I had found in
Bert? I had to know.</p>

<p>I waited until I could stroll out nonchalantly and join Bert
outside. We got into the car and headed for New York. I made
conversation&mdash;gay, inconsequential. All the time I wondered how to
introduce the subject which lay heavy on my heart.</p>

<p>We were nearly at our destination when Bert said something about the
many changes which were taking place in America due to the financial
depression. This gave me an opening. I asked him directly if his
feeling for me had not changed. "I feel that it has, Bert."</p>

<p>He did not reply at once. His silence told me more than words could
have told. So I went on desperately:</p>

<p>"Perhaps there is someone else now?"</p>

<p>"Well...I ought to have told you, darling. There is a girl I've been
seeing a lot of..."</p>

<p>"I know," I said flatly.</p>

<p>He went on then to tell me about her. A pang shot through me when he
said: "I noticed her first because, in a way, she reminded me of
you."</p>

<p>"Have you known her long?"</p>

<p>"No. Only quite recently. You were away, Peaches. You were gone so
long. I missed you."</p>

<p>That brought another pang. And the memory of Philip. Philip had
waited too long, and had lost me. Now I had stayed away too long and
had lost Bert. I thought: people write plays about things like this.
Poets write poems about it. And it's true. It really happens. If I had
not stayed on in London to play <i>Private Lives</i>, if I had come
back to America in the fall, Bert would not have found this girl whose
first charm for him was that she made him think of me.</p>

<p>"You don't know how it is, Gertrude. When I come uptown in the
afternoon, I'm tired. I want to relax, have dinner, play a little
bridge or something, and then get to bed at a decent hour. I don't want
to sit around alone all evening until your show is over to take you out
to supper, and then sit up half the night. I have to be downtown early
in the morning. I know it's too much to ask you to give up the theater
for me," he ended.</p>

<p>Many women, I know, would have answered that wistful half question
differently from the way I had to answer it. Between a young, handsome,
charming millionaire and a career in the theater they would have found
nothing to choose. In a sense, my own choice was made for me. It was
made by that something in my blood which had made me spend two precious
shillings to have cards printed:</p>

<center>LITTLE GERTIE LAWRENCE<br>
<i>Child Actress and Danseuse</i></center>

<p>which had pressed me to run away from home to seek my fortune with
my father. That same compelling force had given me determination to
stick it out with him through the distressing ups and downs.</p>

<p>Give up the theater? I couldn't. The theater was my world. I
belonged to it. To ask me to abandon it was like asking a musician
never to touch a piano or a violin again. Everything that has value has
its price. Nothing worth having is ever handed to you gratis. A career
in the theater is no exception to this hard-and-fast rule.</p>

<p>The price of my career, I thought bitterly in the moment before I
gave Bert his answer, has always been my personal happiness. Would this
always be true? Would there never come a time when I could have a
career and a happy marriage&mdash;as other women I knew?</p>

<p>"I offered to give it up once before, Bert, and you refused. Now I
just can't. Not even for you. Also you aren't in love with me any more,
are you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said. "But I'm terribly fond of you, Peaches. I
always shall be."</p>

<p>"I understand," I said. "It's for you to make the decision. You know
now how I feel about you."</p>

<p>We left it like that. But it was the end, and I knew it. Sooner or
later&mdash;and I suspected it would be sooner&mdash;the news that Bert
Taylor and Gertrude Lawrence were "no longer that way about each other"
would be a pointed paragraph for the gossip writers. If those two women
I had overheard knew that Bert was interested in another girl, then
others knew it. Or soon would. New York, like London, is in many
respects a small town.</p>

<p>I told no one except Helen Downes, who often traveled with me and,
out of friendship, acted as my secretary. No one ever had a more loyal
friend, and I knew I could count on her discretion. Noel was
wonderfully understanding. He asked me lots of questions and gave me
lots of good advice. One evening he said to me suddenly out of the
blue, "I want to talk to you," and he followed me into my dressing
room.</p>

<p>"You think your heart is broken. But it isn't. It's only your pride
that is hurt."</p>

<p>I did not answer. My nerves were unsteady, and at this sign of
friendship I felt the tears rise. I must not cry. Not over a man who
had decided he did not want me. Yes, my pride was hurt. And I had woven
dreams around Bert, dreams of a life together which Pam and his boy and
girl could share. At least one part of me had wanted this from the
earliest days. But there was another side to my nature which would not
be denied&mdash;the side that was satisfied only by the theater and
which could not give this up.</p>

<p>Philip had not understood this about me. Nor had Bert. Both had
offered me security, and Bert great wealth with the security. But in
each case at the price of my career.</p>

<p>I tried to get hold of myself, to steady my nerves. But I had lost
weight and I could not sleep. I jumped when anyone spoke to me. One day
I went to the doctor about my throat. He took one look at me and made
his decision. I was put to bed in a private hospital. Noel was sent for
and told I was too ill to go on that night. I would have to have at
least a fortnight's rest.</p>

<p>Noel did a wonderful thing. He refused to play <i>Private Lives</i>
with anyone else as Amanda. Instead, he took the unprecedented step of
closing the show for two weeks. He and the others of the company ran
down to Nassau for a holiday, and I meekly obeyed the doctor's
orders.</p>

<p>When Noel came back he popped in to see me. I crowed at him:</p>

<p>"Look at me&mdash;I've gained ten pounds. I feel fit as a
fiddle."</p>

<p>"You and your ten pounds," he snorted. "Look at me, my girl. Look at
that tan." He pulled open his shirt to show me what the Nassau sun had
done for his midriff. Then we came back to <i>Private Lives</i>. We
agreed to reopen on the Monday after Easter.</p>

<p>Everyone said it simply could not be done. You couldn't reopen a
popular play after a fortnight, and make it a success again. But we
did. The last two months of the run of <i>Private Lives</i> were even
more successful than the play had been at first. When Noel and I left
the play early in June, my part was taken by Madge Kennedy and Noel's
by Otto Kruger, and <i>Private Lives</i> continued its run on tour.</p>

<p>I was eager to go home. On the crossing I kept saying to myself:
"I'm going home. Home. This time I shall stay." I had cabled my
friends, including Philip, that I was coming, and their welcomes made
me feel glad. Philip cabled he would meet me at Southampton. I looked
forward to seeing him again. When I had played <i>Private Lives</i> in
London I had seen him several times.</p>

<p>On the day before we were to get in I had a radiogram from him
saying he could not meet me, as he had to go to the country, but would
see me soon in London. I was disappointed, but could understand.
Philip's father had died and he had more responsibilities now than
formerly.</p>

<p>Mother was at the dock to meet me. She had brought Pam. We took the
boat train up to London and I went to the Savoy. In those familiar
surroundings I began to feel really at home.</p>

<p>The Savoy has always been a happy place for me. It was the first of
London's big hotels I ever went into. I'll never forget, I ate my first
oyster there. Lee White and Clay Smith had taken me there to lunch to
celebrate my contract with Andr&Atilde;&copy; Charlot. They ordered
oysters, which I had never eaten. I looked a bit fearfully at the
things lying in their shells. I'd often heard it said: "You have to
watch out for oysters."</p>

<p>Clay whispered to me: "They're alive. Or they're supposed to
be."</p>

<p>I whispered back: "What happens if they aren't?"</p>

<p>"If you eat one you get ptomaine."</p>

<p>"Oh." I laid down my oyster fork. I was taking no risks about
getting sick and losing that contract.</p>

<p>"Squirt a bit of lemon on them," Clay advised confidentially. "And
watch. If the oyster squirms, that shows he's alive and you can eat
him."</p>

<p>I squirted the lemon painstakingly on each of the creatures and
scrutinized its reactions. Not a single oyster shuddered in its shell.
All dead, I thought. Lor', suppose I'd eaten one. I watched Lee and
Clay putting theirs away with no regard for the oysters' activity. All
the rest of the day I expected one or both of my new friends to die of
ptomaine. When nothing happened my cockney suspicions were roused and I
asked someone else about oysters and their habits.</p>

<p>I put it down to pay Clay back for pulling my leg.</p>

<br>


<p>The six months I had spent in America seemed no more than six days.
Each time the telephone rang, I thought it would be Philip, but it was
not. On impulse I rang his house in Herefordshire, only to be told he
was in London.</p>

<p>What did that mean?</p>

<p>He said he would be in the country and couldn't meet the boat.</p>

<p>I called his town house. Presently I heard his voice.</p>

<p>"Philip darling, is someone with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That means you can't talk freely now?"</p>

<p>"Yes. That's it."</p>

<p>"Very well. I understand. But I want you to know I'm at the
Savoy."</p>

<p>"I'll come and take you out to dinner," he said. "It will be late.
After eight-thirty."</p>

<p>"I'll wait," I promised.</p>

<p>When Philip arrived he brought me orchids. He gave them to me with
the formal courtesy which was one of the things about him I always
loved. He had a wonderful way at times of making even quite a small
thing seem like an occasion. He kissed me and said how glad he was to
see me. Then, as I opened the florist's box and took out the flowers,
he stood by the mantel, looking not at me, but at the hearth,
apparently engrossed in his own thoughts.</p>

<p>"Where would you like to dine?" he asked presently.</p>

<p>"What about downstairs?"</p>

<p>"No, no. The Ritz. It's quieter there."</p>

<p>We had dinner. He asked me about New York, and how the play had
gone. I told him about Bert, and that we were no longer engaged. He
said he was sorry and hoped I wasn't too unhappy about it. Then he
asked about my plans for next season. We were like two people who had
just been introduced. We were like strangers. There was something on
his mind which he did not know how to tell me. I could see that.</p>

<p>When it got to be about eleven, Philip said abruptly: "I've got to
be pushing off, Dormouse. I have to meet someone."</p>

<p>"Meeting someone?" I inquired. "Where?"</p>

<p>"Yes. At a theater."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>Philip said slowly, "Madeleine Carroll. She's in a play at the
Phoenix with Marie Tempest. I promised to stop for her and take her to
a party."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>It must have been my tone, for he said, as though he found it hard
to get the words out: "I've asked her to marry me. We announced our
engagement day before yesterday."</p>

<p>The day before yesterday! While I was still at sea. What a
home-coming.</p>

<p>There was something more I had to know. I asked him how long he had
been in love with Madeleine. He said, just a little while.</p>

<p>"Perhaps if you had come back sooner, Dormouse. You were away so
long."</p>

<p>That was what Bert had said. And now Philip. Would I always be too
late for happiness? I thought desperately.</p>

<br>

<h2 id="chapter18">18</h2>

<br>


<p>In the course of the next few weeks I learned that though your
chosen work may cost you heavily it comforts you in times of stress.
Above all, if you are a woman and therefore apt to be emotional and
personal, it compels you to be impersonal. It pulls you up by the
bootstraps out of the bog of self-pity.</p>

<p>That is your reward.</p>

<p>And the reward is worth the price you pay for it. No matter how
great. I found it so.</p>

<p>I held to my intention to remain in England for a number of years,
and turned down several American offers. I felt I must re-identify
myself with my own people and with the British theater.</p>

<p>I was working at top speed, and work was good. I played in <i>Take
Two from One</i>, which had been translated from the Spanish of
Mart&Atilde;&shy;nez Sierra. The play was only fair, and the audience
did not like me in a role which was so foreign to the parts I had
played.</p>

<p>I had better luck with <i>Can the Leopard...?</i> with Ian Hunter,
at the Theatre Royal in the Haymarket that winter. I was the leopard of
the title, an irresponsible, untidy, but fascinating lady whose husband
tried, unsuccessfully, to reform her. The play, by Ronald Jeans, got
good notices.</p>

<p>In that role I innovated a new fashion&mdash;an interesting white
lock swept away from the forehead. It caught on immediately. Women
began flocking to the hairdresser's for a "Riviera bleach." If I
couldn't change my spots, I could make the other girls wear my
stripe.</p>

<p>I spent several weeks lazing in the hot sunshine at the Monte Carlo
Beach Hotel reading John van Druten's new play. John called it
<i>Behold We Live</i>, from the verse in St. Paul's epistle, "as dying,
and, behold, we live." Gilbert Miller had arranged to produce it at the
St. James's Theatre in August, with Sir Gerald du Maurier, Dame May
Whitty, and me. Auriol Lee was to direct it.</p>

<p>The play unfolded the story of Sarah, a young lady with a past, who
had attempted to commit suicide. Her case was turned over to an eminent
K.C., who fell in love with her. His arguments made Sarah see that
suicide is cowardly; that it is a bigger thing to live than to resort
to firearms.</p>

<p>Marriage between Sarah and the K.C. was impossible, as he was
already married. She became his mistress&mdash;a relationship which the
man's mother understood and forgave. However, their happiness was
blasted by the K.C.'s sudden illness. He was forced to undergo an
operation, and died as a result. Sarah, unable to be with him at the
last, was left alone to be comforted by, and to comfort, his
mother.</p>

<p>It was a sad play, of course, but deeply moving and uplifting. Sir
Gerald played the K.C. magnificently. The critics commented approvingly
on my "restraint," which pleased me no end. Those same gentlemen of the
press had written previously of my need to develop that quality.</p>

<p>At the premi&Atilde;&uml;re Lady du Maurier and two of her
daughters, Daphne and Angela, were in the stage box, and came backstage
to congratulate us all. But that was the only time Lady du Maurier came
to the play, which was strange, because she loved the theater. I often
wondered about it. A few years later, when Sir Gerald died, I learned
the reason. Sir Gerald suffered from the same incurable disease as the
K.C. in our play. I do not think he knew this, but Lady du Maurier
either knew it or suspected the truth. Naturally, she could not go to
Behold We Live night after night to watch her husband portray his own
destiny.</p>

<p>I felt that with <i>Behold We Live</i> I had reached a high spot in
my career. I, who had begun in light musical comedy and revues, was now
starring as a dramatic actress in a serious role with other truly great
actors. I stopped in at Cartier's one day and ordered a pin for Auriol,
to whom I was immensely grateful. I had it engraved with her name and
"Behold We Live," and my initials. She wore it almost constantly until
her death. In her will she bequeathed it back to me.</p>

<p><i>This Inconstancy</i>, with Nigel Bruce and Leslie Banks, followed
<i>Behold We Live</i>, at Wyndham's Theatre. When I went into my
dressing room I experienced one of the high moments in my life. My name
was on the door in gold letters, added to a long list of very famous
stars who had been there in the past. Ellen Terry's name was there. And
Marie Tempest's. And Irene Vanbrugh's.</p>

<p>While I was playing in <i>This Inconstancy</i> something happened
which seemed unimportant at the time&mdash;just one of those things
which happen every day, which are pleasant, but not momentous. One
evening some friends came backstage to see me and brought with them a
very tall, quiet young American whom they introduced as Richard
Aldrich. Little did I know that he was to enter my life later on.</p>

<p>I was working terribly hard. I needed to. For one thing, I was in
debt. I had never recovered from the bad habit of spending lavishly. I
know I am foolish about money. Some women are. I do not have a true
sense of its value. Either I value it too much, so that I am actually
stingy about a few funny things, or I spend a great deal too much.</p>

<p>I was pressed by creditors in England and in America. I was worried.
I did all the work I could, including a film <i>No Funny Business</i>,
which I made with Owen Nares. I went into business with two friends,
Lady Diana Manners and Felicity Tree (Mrs. Cory Wright), and we opened
a flower shop in Berkeley Square.</p>

<p>When I was a child the family used to discuss possible occupations
for me. One of these was to be a young lady in a flower shop. This
seemed to Mother a genteel vocation. And one which might lead to
something. She reminded me that Cousin Ruby had risen from being a
model at Harrod's to being a model for Raffel Kirchner. Cousin Ruby,
through Kirchner's famous drawings, was the leading pin-up girl of
World War I. Her pretty face smiled at Tommies from the walls of
dugouts and trenches. From there to the Gaiety Theatre and marriage to
Sir Henry Grayson's son had been but a few easy steps.</p>

<p>"Why can't <i>you</i> be like your Cousin Ruby?"</p>

<p>Our flower shop was lovely with flower frescoes on the walls by
Oliver Messel, the clever stage designer, and gay striped awnings. And
it was popular. But it was also a lot of work, and I was busy with many
things. I don't think it made me any money, though it was fun while it
lasted. We called it "Fresh Flowers, Limited," and our friends called
it "Faded Flowers, Incorporated."</p>

<p>Another way I took to increase my earnings was to write some
articles for the <i>Daily Mirror</i>. The paper said women readers
would like to know my views on all sorts of things, so I gave them,
freely. One day a feature writer discovered Pam at Roedean and asked
her to give an interview on her mother. Pam was no more reluctant to do
this than any normal schoolgirl would be. She gave the journalist a
good story&mdash;about how her mother really disliked her work and
would prefer to stay at home and live a quiet, retired life away from
the stage, of which she was tired.</p>

<p>The paper printed it. It was rather awful. It took some living down
and it took some explaining to make my daughter realize that publicity
can be a two-edged sword and needs careful handling.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the bills and the dunning letters mounted. I had put some
of my affairs into the hands of Fanny Holtzmann, the lawyer in New York
to whom Noel Coward and Clifton Webb had recommended me. Fanny
understood the theater and its people. She had helped me out of some
difficulties when I was playing <i>Private Lives</i> in New York. But
now she was in America. I thought, she'll be coming to London soon. She
comes over often. I'll get hold of her then and get her to help me out
of the muddle of my tax complications and bills.</p>

<p>That autumn Charles Cochran put on a play called <i>Nymph Errant</i>
which was made from the novel of the same name by James Laver. It was
the story of an English schoolgirl on her way home from school in
Switzerland who met a Frenchman and set out with him on a series of
adventures. These carried her ultimately into the most fantastic
places. Incredibly, she came back at the end still wide-eyed, and quite
unaware of what she had seen and escaped from. One of the amazing
things about this story was that it was the work of a quiet,
middle-aged scholar, who was head curator at the Victoria and Albert
Museum.</p>

<p>I adored <i>Nymph Errant</i>. It has remained one of my favorite
plays. Cole Porter wrote the music for it and Agnes de Mille arranged
the ballets. I wanted to play it in America, and we would have done so
but for the problem of financing such an elaborate production at a time
when America was still in the throes of the depression.</p>

<p><i>Nymph Errant</i> was a tremendous success in London. Nonetheless,
I was worried. Not over the play or my future, but about my financial
affairs; it seemed that the more money I made, the more I spent. I
didn't seem able to get ahead, and my affairs were in a bewildering
tangle.</p>

<p>Then the ax fell. The British Government came down on me for unpaid
income taxes on my American earnings dating from some years back. As a
British subject and resident I had not known that I was liable to
taxation in both countries.</p>

<p>The news of my tax problems which appeared in the press opened the
eyes of my creditors. All at once they descended on me. The straw that
broke the camel's back was a laundry bill for fifty pounds. I could not
pay it, and as a consequence I was forced into bankruptcy.</p>

<p>I understand that the British law which covers bankruptcies is much
more severe than the law in America. I only know it was exceedingly
stern with me. When I came out of Carey Street Court I had nothing,
literally, but the clothes I stood in. Nothing else. My cars, my
apartment, my jewels, even most of my clothes had been seized.</p>

<p>Fortunately the disaster did not affect Pam. Thanks to that trust
fund I had established for her long before. I never ceased to be glad
of that.</p>

<p>There came a day when Dorothy, my faithful maid, Mack, my dog, and I
stood on the pavement outside the house in Portland Place. We had
literally not a roof to crawl under. No money and no credit. This was
all the more extraordinary because I was appearing in a successful
play&mdash;and on the surface was a successful actress.</p>

<p>Bill Linnett and Bill O'Bryen, who were my managers, came to our
rescue. Bill Linnett offered me his flat in the Albany while he went to
stay with Bill O'Bryen. It was a warm, friendly, encouraging gesture,
and I shall never forget them for it.</p>

<p>It was up to me to start all over again, this time with a load of
debts to pay off.</p>

<p>I did pay them off, all of them. It took me two years. I could have
borrowed from friends, even from Noel, but something held me back. It
was not just pride. It was a sincere desire to force myself to undergo
the discipline which could be learned only by stern self-denial.</p>

<p>With the play still running, I started a film, which meant that at
five-thirty every morning I was up and caught the workman's tram to
Denham to act in <i>Rembrandt</i> with Charles Laughton. After working
all day at the studio I hurried back to the theater to go on in
<i>Tonight at 8.30</i>. When the film was completed, I accepted an
engagement at the Caf&Atilde;&ordf; de Paris, where I sang nightly
after the theater.</p>

<p>Two years of work at that pace, and I was free of debt.</p>

<p>Noel brought <i>Tonight at 8.30</i> to New York. Immediately I
landed in New York, I found myself faced by a new array of debts. It
seems that under the British law I could be cleared of bankruptcy in
that country while my debts in America remained unpaid. I had not known
this. I thought I was done with it all, but I was not. I had to go
through it all again&mdash;the unpleasant publicity, the prying into my
affairs, the court proceedings. Again I turned to Fanny Holtzmann, but
she was in Hollywood. Her brother David took over my affairs until she
returned.</p>

<p>Between us we worked out an arrangement which left me free to do my
own work, to finish the run of <i>Tonight at 8:30</i>, and then to go
into Rachel Crothers' play <i>Susan and God</i>, while my financial and
legal problems were taken over by the Holtzmann office.</p>

<p>Noel read the play and remarked: "The only good thing about it is
the title." But I had been impressed by it when Rachel Crothers first
read it to me. We talked it over. She agreed that several scenes had to
be rewritten, and while she was doing this I ran home to England for
the Coronation. I went with a peaceful mind. I was really free of debt
at last, on both sides of the Atlantic. My affairs were in order.</p>

<p>I thought, that summer, holidaying in England: I'm a very lucky
woman.</p>

<p>I have Pam. I have my work. I have friends, hopes for the future. I
have lived a full, busy, active, and on the whole happy life.</p>

<br>


<p>I shall always be glad I saw London during the Coronation summer. It
was wonderful&mdash;a last burst of splendor before the storm
burst.</p>

<p>I came back to America to open in <i>Susan and God</i>, which played
successfully on Broadway for two seasons. After its run, in 1939, I
remember Samson Raphaelson trying to read me the script of his play
<i>Skylark</i> while the radio in my living room gave forth the news of
Munich. My heart was full of forebodings.</p>

<p>It was not long before those forebodings were justified. While I
played in <i>Skylark</i> my country was plunged into war.</p>

<p>It made me restless and uneasy.</p>

<p>I was asked to play at the summer theater at Dennis on Cape Cod. The
offer sounded delightful and I said I would go. I remember my trip by
train. There was something exciting about it. I knew suddenly that I
was embarking upon an adventure.</p>

<p>John Golden had recommended my going to play <i>Skylark</i> on the
Cape. True to form and his love of showmanship he sent a fantastic
story ahead of me, about the kind of woman I was. It gave the
impression that I was an exotic creature who drank only champagne,
demanded specially heated cars, and refused to sleep in any but her own
extra-fine sheets.</p>

<p>I have since been told that when Richard Aldrich, who was the
producer for the Cape Playhouse, read this he exclaimed: "Oh,
nuts."</p>

<p>I have never blamed him.</p>

<p>I got off the Cape Codder about half-past ten in the pitch dark. The
man who led me to a car was noncommittal when I asked about my luggage
and not very enthusiastic. This was the same Richard Aldrich whom I had
met in London several years before. Though he was passably polite, I
got the impression he was not overimpressed by me.</p>

<p>He told me he was driving me to the cottage which was to be mine for
my stay. I could not see it, for there were no lights in the windows
when we drove up. I began to feel that Cape Cod was a very standoffish
place.</p>

<p>Mr. Aldrich guided me up the path-and into the door.</p>

<p>"Wait there and I'll switch on the lights."</p>

<p>I waited. The lights came on, and before my eyes grew used to them,
people suddenly began popping out from under the tables, out of doors,
from everywhere. Voices cried welcomes and "Surprise! Surprise!" It was
a party to welcome me, and the leader of it was Jules Glaenzer, who had
been my friend since my first winter in America. Among the guests were
all the members of the Playhouse cast and Radie Harris, who was
covering the opening for her radio program and her column in
<i>Variety</i>.</p>

<p>I played at Dennis through that summer season. That winter, when I
went about town, I had a new beau&mdash;Richard Aldrich. And a new
happiness in my heart.</p>

<p>Richard and I took our time. We both wanted to be very, very sure. I
had made one mistake in marriage. I did not want to make another. It
was curious about Richard&mdash;it was as though he combined in one
person the different things I had found and admired in Philip Astley
and in Bert Taylor. He was Boston and Harvard, and had been a banker,
but above all he loved the theater. He was the first man in my life who
understood what my career in the theater meant to me&mdash;the first
man who really understood me.</p>

<p>And so we were married. On the Fourth of July 1940. We chose this
date because it had special significance for both of us. For Richard it
was his country's birthday and for me it was my own.</p>

<p>For years I had said to myself: when I marry it is going to be a
country wedding. I pictured myself being married in the evening in
black lace and by candlelight.</p>

<p>We were married in the evening on the Cape. But in the pouring
rain&mdash;Richard in white flannels and I in a gray sports suit. We
ran through the sopping grass down to his cottage and were married
there, with two friends and my maid Dorothy as witnesses.</p>

<p>Then, hand in hand, under one umbrella, we ran back up the path to
the house of the Fran Harts, where friends were gathered to greet
us.</p>

<p>So we were married....</p>

<p>"And we will live happily ever after," I said to Richard.</p>

<p>"If the war does not separate us."</p>

<p>"I know." My fingers tightened around his. The war was getting
closer to America every week. At all times the thought of what was
happening to London every night kept me grim company. "But if it comes,
we'll take it together."</p>

<p>The next day I received a telegram from Noel Coward which said:</p>

<blockquote><i>[Noel Coward's short poem of congratulation has been
omitted from this ebook for reasons of copyright.]</i></blockquote>

<p>To which I replied:</p>

<p>After we returned to New York I had to go into rehearsals for

moved into our new apartment and looked forward to our life

<p>Then came Pearl Harbor, and Richard, like millions of other

to war. I began to dream and plan how to get to the front too.</p>

<br>


<p>Thursday, August 19, 1944. We are off at last. I am writing this by
the roadside, where our convoy has halted by a clearing camp for the
night. We are parked like all the invasion convoys we saw last June. We
are over fifty trucks, jeeps, et cetera, and one hundred and ten
artistes&mdash;the largest E.N.S.A. outfit to sail for Normandy.</p>

<p>We include Diana Wynyard, Jessie Matthews, Bobbie Andrews, Margaret
Rutherford, Ivor Novello, and many others whose names I don't know yet,
but who all seem in great form. Each unit or company has its own van,
which includes beds and cook's galley. Part of my old unit is with me
and we are conspicuous for the three fattest people in the convoy:
Leslie, our pianist, two hundred and fifty pounds; Joe, the drummer, at
almost that; and Zo&Atilde;&laquo; who weighs in at just under two
hundred and has comfortably given up worrying about it. These three,
plus Zo&Atilde;&laquo;'s husband, Basil, Clarence, the violinist, and I
share one sleeping coach. The four men are in the tail end in bunks,
then comes the lavatory; and the front portion and the galley are
occupied by Zo&Atilde;&laquo; and me, with beds slung over the dining
table like uppers in a Pullman. The officer and the corporal driver are
sleeping in the camp by the side of the road. But it's pretty close
quarters, and there are a lot of advantages in being slender. Mary
Barrett cried this morning when we left E.N.S.A. headquarters at
Hindhead. We all wished she could have come with us, but from now on we
are on our own. We are now really and truly in the Army and subject to
rigid Army rules. Our escorting officer's name is Stokes, so of course
he is now known as "Pogis."</p>

<p>I have just been up the road and vamped some cup hooks out of the
local builder so we can hang things up in our sleeper.</p>

<p>I have made up Zo&Atilde;&laquo;'s bunk and my own, swept the floor,
and put everything I shall need under my pillow, as it will be dark
when we are called, and no lights must be shown here or at the dock. I
must remember not to sit bolt upright suddenly in my bunk. The
clearance is exactly two feet.</p>

<br>


<p>We were called at 3: 30 A.M., rose, dressed in the dark, and went to
mess at the camp, carrying our own mess kits and stumbling the
half-mile down the road by torchlight.</p>

<p>Three E.N.S.A. units left for the port of embarkation around 4: 30
A.M. We returned to the convoy until nine-thirty. When we got going,
everybody was excited. We rolled into Portsmouth at ten o'clock; our
passports were examined and we were issued "Geneva Cards," in which we
are rated as lieutenants in the British Army. This in case we are taken
prisoners. Before embarking on our LST, she filled up with tanks and
our own equipment, and we had the dubious pleasure of seeing several
hundred German prisoners come ashore. Dubious, because they were a
sorry, disillusioned-looking lot. Among them was a small boy, nine
years old, in German uniform, said to be the son of a conscripted
Russian, who had refused to work for the enemy without his boy. The
mother had been killed. The British authorities were being kind to him,
and he seemed very able to take care of himself, although he could not
speak English or German, but kept saying "Merci."</p>

<p>We are now actually "away" on our trip to France. It is a beautiful
day, the crossing should be a good one, and it is good to get out of
the coaches. We have had "muster," "Mae West" drill, and are now in the
wardroom having tea while we clear the port&mdash;this for security
reasons. The crossing is due to take about eighteen hours. So we sleep
aboard, and are scheduled to arrive in Normandy "sometime
Saturday."</p>

<br>


<p>A good night and a good breakfast at 7:00 A.M.</p>

<p>We have been joined by an enormous convoy and by mine sweepers, as
we are now in the "mine path." The beaches are almost in sight.</p>

<p>I have been helping the Navy Red Cross to peel potatoes. They tell
me that once on the other side these LSTs become hospital ships and are
used to evacuate our own and German wounded prisoners. Most of the
captured German officers are very arrogant and refuse medical
treatment, injections, and even food, for fear of being poisoned. They
have been taught to believe this. One wounded German aviator spat at
our medical officers and kept asking, "How far England?" He was in
great need of attention in general but refused to be treated. Finally
one of the medical corpsmen said, "Now look 'ere, if you don't be'ave
yerself, we'll send the lot of ye to London where the flying bombs
are!" That did it! The sick bay is always down in the tank deck in a
converted LST. They said you could hear that German's scream right up
to the captain's bridge. Another member of the master race wanted to
know how far the Germans had advanced into Sussex.</p>

<p>Our LST came across like a bird, and we dropped anchor at
twelve-thirty yesterday, nineteenth, at Corselles, which was one of our
first beachheads on D-Day. It all looked very quiet and far from
warlike except for hundreds of ships of all sizes and shapes doing
every kind of different job and the dreadful shambles made by the
destruction of the German beach fortifications. We were a tank carrier,
so we had to unload by opening the bulkheads, letting down the ramp, et
cetera. It's frightening at first to see the crew deliberately open the
entire bow of the ship; one is sure the sea will rush in and sink the
clumsy, heavily laden craft. We had to stand by until the tide was low
enough for the tanks to take to the sands.</p>

<p>Some of the crew went over the side for a swim, and I wanted to.
Perhaps I looked wistful, because the sailors aboard the U.S.LCT (6)
767, which was standing by, called across the water:</p>

<p>"Say, sister, why don't you go in?"</p>

<p>"I would," I called back, "if I had some trunks."</p>

<p>"We'll fix you up. Wait a sec."</p>

<p>Several pairs of hands were laid on a huge sailor. He was pushed,
protestingly, behind a group which shielded him, and his yowls told
that his capacious trunks had been pulled from him. The trunks,
decidedly outsize, were tossed over to our deck.</p>

<p>The Yanks had dared me to come on in.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to find a secluded corner where I could
slip out of my uniform and into the trunks. They hung limply around me
fore and aft. Zo&Atilde;&laquo; supplied a bra&mdash;one of her own and
on the same scale as the trunks. I was safely pinned into it, a cap was
produced from somewhere, and to the delighted shrieks of our E.N.S.A.
members I was pushed forward to the rail.</p>

<p>With cheers from the Yanks I dived off the ramp and swam ashore to
set foot on French soil for the first time since 1937. It was
glorious.</p>

<p>I must stop here to tell the sequel to my swimming ashore on the
Normandy beachhead. An account of it appeared in <i>Life</i> magazine.
Shortly afterward the editors received a letter from Ensign J. W. Wray
of the U.S.LCT (6) 767 of which the final paragraph read:</p>

<p>"The trunks which she borrowed from my 210-pound Mo.M.M. were most
becomingly draped. We hope Miss Lawrence did not jettison the trunks
during her tour of France, as we would like to have them back to
suspend from the yardarm in memoriam."</p>

<p>The trunks were jettisoned, of course. Instead, I sent off to the
crew of U.S.LCT (6) 767 a pair of my own pink silk lace-trimmed panties
with the message:</p>

<blockquote><i>Keep 'em flying until I can fill 'em.</i></blockquote>

<p>As we beached we heard the news that the British had made another
advance, which brought them to within three miles of Paris.</p>

<p>"Ssh!" said Bobbie Andrews. "I think I can hear Alice Delysia
singing the 'Marseillaise' even from here."</p>

<p>Alice had gone across for E.N.S.A. a week ahead of us, and much had
been made in the press about her picking up a handful of French soil
and saying: "I shall not go back until I have thrown this over the Arc
de Triomphe."</p>

<p>She has a fine record for her work with E.N.S.A. and, being French,
she was naturally longing to get to Paris. We drove in convoy from the
beach to Masefield, which is a clearing depot. There we met Colonel
Haggarth, our C.O., and were sent on to St. Aubin for four days. Ivor
and the others have gone south to Bayeux. But we feel very superior
because we're going "up the line."</p>

<p>On arriving at the village "estaminet," where our unit is in billet,
two of my bags were missing. I motored back to Bayeux, hoping to
retrieve them before the convoy split up. I went in a tiny jeep-sort of
car known as a "Tilly" over twenty-two miles of invasion-made craters
filled with oily mud. Captain Stokes Roberts drove, and we finally got
there just as the convoy was pulling out for somewhere else. No halting
is allowed on the roads, which are packed with stuff coming to and from
the front line and the beaches. So we tacked onto the end of the
convoy. After about three miles the line slowed down a bit and I jumped
out of our Tilly and made a dash in search of the coach in which I had
slept on the way from Hindhead. I scrambled aboard, flung open the
cupboard, and there were my bags! I grabbed them, jumped off, and
waited for my chance to dash back along the line. Then Captain Stokes
Roberts reached out and yanked me and my baggage aboard. We pulled out
of the convoy and returned&mdash;this time in pitch darkness&mdash;to
St. Aubin.</p>

<p>That journey was terrific. Tracer bullets filled the sky. We met
convoys coming from the beaches&mdash;all kinds of mysterious guns,
cranes, stores, vanloads of German prisoners, and miles of Red Cross
cars creeping along slowly in the dark so as not to jolt the wounded on
the bad roads. We got back to the billet by midnight. No food, no
light, and no water. But I had the bags, and a little brandy in a
flask, and oh! boy, it was a lifesaver!</p>

<p>When I started to pin up my hair for the next day's show, I dropped
a bobby pin. It sounds like a small thing, but in these circumstances
they are as priceless as pearls. So I got out my flashlight, and there
in its beam was my bobby pin and the sabot from a doll's foot&mdash;I
shall keep it always for luck. I wonder what became of the child whose
toy it was. But one learns not to ask questions.</p>

<p>We have been here at St. Aubin since we arrived in France, but we
are doing two shows a day about eight kilos along the coast at
Lion-sur-Mer. The place was occupied only a week ago and is a complete
mess of mine craters, barbed wire, bombed and shelled houses, and each
day the sea brings in its dead.</p>

<p>Our theater was once the Casino-sur-Mer, very gay and
chocolate-boxy, but now it is all <i>Mer</i> and no Casino. The
building is full of holes; no windows, no roof, no doors, and yet,
somehow or other, we manage to put on a show. The men come in in
hundreds. We are the first entertainers they've seen since D-Day.</p>

<p>This new life is going to be very strenuous. The food, when fresh,
is often flyblown, and the canned food is always the same old Spam or
bully beef &Atilde; la something. Everyone has a touch of
dysentery&mdash;very painful and most inconvenient. How I would love to
lie down in a dark, quiet room somewhere with a hot-water bottle. I
clean my own shoes, bring up my own water for my bath, and do my own
laundry, when there is water. I never seem to quite catch up with
myself or get any rest. But this is war as it really is, and I feel
good and glad to be here.</p>

<p>The attitude of these Norman French is a little puzzling at times,
but quite understandable in a way. At first these people (those who did
not perish in the bombardment) were not at all sure that we could
liberate them from the enemy. They felt that our landings would not be
permanent, and that all this killing, loss of homes, and general chaos
would be in vain; that the Germans would push us back again. Now that
they know they are really free, they are more friendly to us. But even
my Madame Martin said at <i>d&Atilde;&copy;jeuner</i> yesterday,
"Mademoiselle, there were only forty Germans here in St. Aubin. All
this destruction was not necessary." She was not a
collaborationist&mdash;she has been evacuated from three different
homes, but this was what she had been told, and she believed it.</p>

<p>Obviously, her informants were lying. I have been along the beaches
and have seen the German defenses&mdash;the mines, the guns, and the
famous West Wall. It took thousands of Germans to man all these. I have
also seen our ships lying on the beaches with their sides blown out and
their backs broken. And piles of knocked-out tanks whose occupants
never even landed. The Norman Mesdames Martin are merely repeating,
parrot-like, what the enemy told them. It is very dangerous around
here; several people were killed yesterday when a mine was washed up on
the shore. Nobody drives or walks anywhere unless in another's
tracks.</p>

<p>I hope to go to Caen on Sunday. In preparation I shall wash my hair
at the officers' mess unit at Lion-sur-Mer today. They have electricity
there, so I can get it dry.</p>

<p>Today is again Sunday and I have been in "Liberated France" exactly
one week. If I thought I was in the Army before, I certainly know it
now. We were to move farther up the line today, but the advance has
been so rapid it is impossible to get to a place in time to catch up
with the Army. So we are staying on in the Casino for one more week,
and the men are to be brought back to us in trucks and lorries.</p>

<p>This morning we were put into an Army camp with the ATS and the
NAAFI and R.A.S.C. I am writing this after curfew, by torchlight, in a
room with plaster walls, bare boards, no bathroom of any sort, and my
few belongings doing their best to give the place "the woman's touch"!
I have put up some nails. It would seem the Army hangs everything up on
the floor. We are "out of bounds for officers and troops," meals are
eaten in mess, but we manage to have a lot of sort of school-dormitory
fun.</p>

<p>There is another E.N.S.A. unit in this camp: Forsyth, Seaman, and
Farrell. They are Americans but have been with E.N.S.A. for three or
four years. They do a lot of outdoor shows and played only yesterday to
seven thousand men!</p>

<p>It has been a most impressive day. The Doc and Captain John Bradshaw
called for me at two-thirty in a jeep, and we set off to "do some
shopping." We went to Cobourg&mdash;where only four days ago the
Germans had been holding out. It was a dangerous and thrilling ride; we
were all armed in case we ran into snipers. The roads are still mined
on both sides, so no car could risk passing another, and along the way
were many huge craters filled with the blood of human beings and
cattle. There was no other car on the road going either way. I saw
three French people on bicycles, pedaling back to see if they could
find their homes or friends.</p>

<p>The little town was completely dead, no sign of life, not a shop
standing, not a soul about, but everywhere the many German
skull-and-crossbones signs saying "<i>Minen</i>." And fields full of
the glider planes which had landed our air-borne troops.</p>

<p>We drove on cautiously to the main street. Here the atmosphere was
so eerie that I felt I had to speak in a whisper. The shops still stood
there, although very much damaged. Captain Bradshaw had been in the
town the day before and found two shops to which the people had
returned, and he had brought chocolate and cigarettes for them. We
parked the jeep, kept our hands on our guns, and stole quietly along
the deserted street, keeping an eye open for any stray snipers.</p>

<p>At the door of a wine shop we stopped, and a dog barked from within.
We spoke quietly in French and in English, and presently an iron grille
in the door was opened by a young woman. She was alone, her husband a
prisoner in Germany and her child and mother
&Atilde;&copy;vacu&Atilde;&copy;es. We gave her chocolate and
cigarettes and told her the news and we bought some wine from her.</p>

<p>We went next to the <i>farmacie</i>. Here we found mother, father,
daughter, and young son. All had stayed hidden during the siege. The
shop was a complete wreck. However, in the cellar in an old brown
leather bag we found perfume, powder, lipstick, and rouge, and we
bought all they had. Each one of the family got something he wanted:
the boy got chocolate; Papa got tobacco; Maman got cigarettes, and
daughter got conversation. She spoke good English, having been to
Farnborough near Aldershot for her holidays every summer in
peacetime.</p>

<p>We gave them wine and then helped them bring back some of their
furniture, which they had hidden in the cellar of a near-by house when
the Germans first came. We left finally and promised to return when we
could with white bread and marmalade. These people are still numb and
cannot quite believe that they are free. On the way back we passed a
few more stragglers returning, hoping to find something left. In one
completely wrecked house I saw an old woman standing among all the
rubble, with a <i>duster</i> in her hand! God only knows what she
thought she could do, but her woman's instinct told her she should get
started on something. She was, in a way, a symbol, and one I shall
never forget.</p>

<p>Five years of war today. Our Army is eleven miles from the German
frontier, across the Moselle, and the Gertrude Lawrence Unit has
arrived in Deauville.</p>

<p>The ride here was torture&mdash;through Cobourg and its bomb craters
(by misdirection), back again via Caen, trapped in a four-mile-long
R.A.F. convoy&mdash;through miles of utter devastation. Bodies of dead
Germans, looking like inflated rubber dolls, lie face down in the
waters of the Orne.</p>

<p>Deauville is not badly damaged&mdash;it is just a dead seaside
resort. The Hotel Normandie is prewar in its French atmosphere with
good carpets, smart windows, and a wide brass bed and all its
trimmings. However, it is all like a movie set&mdash;nothing works.
Fancy fittings in the bathroom, but no water. Elaborate lamps and
switches, but no electricity. Not even candles. A phantom hotel in a
ghost town. As there are no blackout curtains and we are forbidden to
use even a flashlight after dark, we decided to go to bed while it was
still light enough to unpack. I went to sleep. Suddenly I was startled
by a distant banging and sat bolt upright in the dark. The knowledge
that the enemy had been here only four days before made me think
"Gestapo"! The banging continued, and I realized that it was no time to
disobey. I grabbed my flashlight from under the pillow and stumbled to
the door. Without opening it, I said, "<i>Qui est l&Atilde;</i> " A
deep voice replied, "Open up. It's Hunt here."</p>

<p>I didn't know who Hunt was, but the voice was obviously British, so
I opened the door a crack and said, "What time is it, and what do you
want?"</p>

<p>"I'm Lieutenant Hunt. You are to get dressed at once and come with
me!"</p>

<p>Definitely of the Gestapo species, I thought, but what was the fuss
about? Was I about to be court-martialed?</p>

<p>I turned on my flashlight, and there stood a very tired-looking but
determined R.A.S.C. officer who presented me with our orders.</p>

<p>I realized instantly that this was an incident not to be dismissed
or handled alone, so in the murky darkness I said, "Follow me,
Lieutenant," and I took him along the corridor to Basil and
Zo&Atilde;&laquo;'s room. Zo&Atilde;&laquo; was already in bed and
Basil was in the bathroom with a tiny bit of candle trying to shave in
a teacup of water which he had smuggled from the dining room. We all
pointed out to Lieutenant Hunt that it was impossible for us to leave.
Leslie and Joe were still out somewhere.</p>

<p>It was then 10:45 P.M., and the order was for us to drive by truck
to the Seine, get across at 6:00 A.M., drive forty-five kilos to
Amiens, and do a show on arrival.</p>

<p>The lieutenant looked us over, and Basil said, "Well, I don't know
about anybody else's opinion. I have just washed my teeth and myself
with half a cup of water. I'm going to finish shaving with the other
half and then I'm going to bed."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Hunt saw our predicament, said he would return to Major
Jamieson and make his report, and we all went back to bed to await
court-martial! Next morning we hung about the hotel, not daring to
leave and waiting for the summons to come.</p>

<p>We packed up and were ready for the worst. At 10:30 A.M. our new
orders came and we started off with Captain Bayliss for St. Valery to
join the column we'd missed the night before.</p>

<p>To reach St. Valery, we had to find a bridge or a ferry to take us
across the Seine. We rattled along through the Breton Forest, past
thousands of dead horses shot during the German retreat. We stopped at
Quillebeuf, but the bridge had been blasted away and we were sent on. A
Frenchwoman came running out, grasped my hand, and asked me to find her
son in America and tell him she was safe and to please write to her.
From there we moved on along the winding shore of the Seine which
almost completes a circle at this point. No bridge remained intact and
no ferry was running nearer than Rouen, a good ten hours away. We
decided to go on to Grey's Ferry at Hauteville which our own R.E.s had
built.</p>

<p>We paused at one-thirty in Pont-Audemer to eat and, as we were
leaving, having given cigarettes to M. le patron and chocolate to the
children, we saw a sign written on the wall of the caf&Atilde;&copy;
which read, "This establishment catered to the enemy during the war."
We had been entertained and been fed by German collaborationists!</p>

<p>We shoved on again and finally reached Hauteville at about three
o'clock. Here again was a sight I shall never forget&mdash;all the
signs of utter chaos and frustrated flight which the enemy had left
behind him. The stench was sickening.</p>

<p>We were told the ferry was not working, but "ducks" were crossing
both ways with impertinent ease. It was decided that Captain Bayliss
and I should thumb a ride over and find our what help we could get from
the other side. So over we went, and found the ferry on the opposite
bank in charge of Lieutenant Doug Allen and his company of Royal
Canadian Engineers. He said the ferry was out of action but there was a
pontoon raft which he was sending over for supplies. If we talked to
Corporal Pete he would know if it would take our extra weight.</p>

<p>We found Corporal Pete having his dinner on the grass by the mess
wagon. He was an enormous man.</p>

<p>He paused with his mouth full and stared at me.</p>

<p>"Don't I know you? I've seen you before, darned if I ain't."</p>

<p>"I've been in Canada," I said. "Several times."</p>

<p>Corporal Pete's face cleared. "Got it. It was at the Mount Royal. I
can tell you the year. It was I938. You was there lunching with Air
Marshal Billy Bishop. You drank tomato juice. I remember that. And you
did as well on it as lots of them do on scotch. You're Gertrude
Lawrence. Shake." He held out a huge paw.</p>

<p>We shook, and&mdash;to show what tomato juice can
accomplish&mdash;on the strength of it Corporal Pete agreed to ferry us
across the Seine.</p>

<p>We sent word back across the river to the others that we were coming
for them and hoped to get them and the vehicle across. The raft was
floated by six pontoons and driven by four motors. She looked all right
to us, until we saw the gang start to man the pumps! They pumped and
pottered for two hours. "They always take in a little water after a
while," said one of the R.E.s. Finally the raft was brought alongside,
a duck was hitched to it by a tow-rope, and we were taken across. The
party cheered as we arrived, and ramps were laid on the beach and we
started to load up. Our coach got on first, then a jeep, then a supply
lorry, then another jeep.</p>

<p>It was 7:00 P.M. as we cast off to cross the Seine. The current was
running fast and strong away from where we wanted to go. However, it
had been easy for the ducks, and the span wasn't very wide at this
point. This time, to my silent dismay, we had no duck to aid us, and
five minutes after casting off one of our four engines conked out. We
started to drift with the heavy current. Three engines were going like
mad, but we were making no headway whatever. A duck came alongside and
threw us a line, but the tide was too strong and the towrope broke. We
continued to lose ground, and finally Corporal Pete ordered the gang to
throw out the anchor, saying we would ride where we were till help
came.</p>

<p>By this time it was getting dark, a breeze was coming up, and I knew
two things which I had not told the others. Each day the Seine is
flooded by a bore which sweeps in from the Channel and causes a tidal
wave twelve feet high. All light craft are cleared from the water at
this time. The night before sixty-three persons had been drowned. The
bore was due to come at midnight, and it was now nine o'clock and we
were at anchor in midstream.</p>

<p>My heart was pounding and my senses alert to the danger.</p>

<p>Finally Corporal Pete decided to lift anchor and drift over to
<i>any</i> part of the shore we could make and try to unload the raft
before it got any later. I knew he meant before it got <i>too</i> late.
He hoped to unload us all before the bore came down. We made the shore
about a mile below where we should have landed, and wooden tracks were
laid down. One jeep got off and away. Next came the lorry with
supplies, but the bank was too steep and it got stuck. Just then, in
the blackness, we heard the throb of motors, and dimly out of the
darkness there loomed the shapes of two ducks. They came alongside, and
it was decided to leave the lorry and get it by road the next morning.
We put out into midstream again, the ducks were placed one in front
towing and one at back pushing, and our own engines were running. It
was now very, very cold and windy, but our spirits rose. We made a
little headway, then the pontoons began to splash over. It was too dark
to bale and we couldn't spare the men. It was now ten-thirty. All
methods were used to get us moving, but the river was a raging torrent
by this time, and the ducks were going round in circles, taking us with
them.</p>

<p>Allen and Pete ordered, "Abandon ship and take to the ducks." The
vehicles were lashed down, we grabbed our valuables, and all personnel
took to the ducks and went hell for leather for the landing.</p>

<p>It's very strange, under stress, what one regards as valuable. I
luckily was in battle dress (trousers, shirt, and short jacket), so I
was sure of being able to swim. But my mind concentrated on the fact
that, no matter if all was lost, my job was still to look glamorous, so
I grabbed my make-up kit. After all, I can always do a show if I've got
my false eyelashes. Clarence had saved his precious violin. Leslie had
the music. But all else&mdash;including Joe Nicholls' five drums, our
costumes and personal clothing&mdash;had to be abandoned. We finally
reached the landing amid the cheers of the Canadian Engineer Corps who
had been waiting for us, and we went ashore fifteen minutes before we
heard the whine and rush of the bore.</p>

<p>We had to stay somewhere for the night and would have been content
in the fields, but the bore had brought rain with it, so we were packed
into trucks and taken to a deserted ch&Atilde;&cent;teau which the
enemy had taken over. Here were housed the refugees from the battle
areas, and here we slept that night, huddled together on the bare
boards, in our clothes; tired, dirty, but lucky to be alive. I wondered
where Richard was.</p>

<p>Next morning we were awakened at seven by our Captain Bayliss to be
told to "look outside." We did, and there in the courtyard stood our
coach. The raft had ridden the bore and the Canadians had gone up at
dawn with salvage ducks and brought the whole thing back to shore
intact. We washed in the stables with the men, went to breakfast at the
field kitchen, and then got under way on the road to St. Valery. We
were all very tired, and I ached all over from the boards and the cold
and the long hours on the crater roads, but now we were really arriving
as ordered by H.Q.</p>

<p>We reached St. Valery only to find a completely dead and deserted
town. Not a soldier or a civilian in sight. The water front was
barricaded and marked "<i>Minen</i>," so we inquired of a sort of
gendarme. He sent us to the mayor, who told us that the 51st Highland
Division had left that morning for Le Havre to help with the siege. As
we were supposed to be joining our E.N.S.A. column, which was
entertaining the 52d Highland Division, we supposed we'd better follow
on to Le Havre. Captain Bayliss said he didn't like the idea of taking
us two women&mdash;Zo&Atilde;&laquo; and me&mdash;into that area
without some confirmation from H.Q., so he and the corporal and two of
our unit went off in our wagon to find the Army, while
Zo&Atilde;&laquo; Basil, Clarence, and I stayed behind at St. Valery.
Clarence, who speaks French, went scrounging around and found an old
couple who had just come back to their home. They boiled some water for
us, and Zo&Atilde;&laquo; and I had our first decent wash since leaving
Lion-sur-Mer almost a week ago! We left our bags with the old couple
and went for a walk. Everywhere was to be seen destruction and the
signs of the fierce street fighting before the enemy was driven out. We
had no food with us, but we were again lucky and found the people at
the H&Atilde;&acute;tel de la Gare willing to share a meal with us. We
paid them, of course, and they were <i>tr&Atilde;&uml;s content</i> to
have the British instead of the enemy. At three o'clock an aged
gendarme rode into the square on a bicycle, dismounted, and rang a
bell. Half a dozen bedraggled women, four children, and three old
folks, and ourselves gathered round. With great ceremony he produced a
dirty sheet of paper and began to read a proclamation that citizens
should not go into the fields or touch anything because of mines; and
that their claims for damage to property should be in at the mayor's
office by Wednesday. He then rode slowly away, and the people drifted
back out of sight again, back to the task of trying to make something
out of nothing.</p>

<p>We hung about feeling very conspicuous and helpless. At five Captain
Bayliss returned. They had been to F&Atilde;&copy;camp, but the 52d
Highland Division was not there. From there they were sent to Etretat
and finally caught up with it. But no sign of E.N.S.A. However, after
he explained our plight, the C.O. agreed to send word down the line
saying where we were and suggested that we join them at Etretat and
give a show.</p>

<br>


<p>Without meaning to be, we are now the most advanced E.N.S.A. Unit.
Basil, Zo&Atilde;&laquo; and I are billeted over a plumber's shop. The
others are at a hotel. Last night we gave two shows, one for the men
just out of the line, and one for those going into battle at Le Havre,
and then we were given supper at the mess and the pipers played and
danced for us.</p>

<p>Today, September the seventh, we were to join our E.N.S.A. column
and do an outdoor show, but a storm has come. It is dark and raining
hard, so we are lying around awaiting orders. The visibility is bad and
the men cannot fly.</p>

<p>These men of the 52d Highland Division are magnificent soldiers.
They were at El Alamein, Sicily, Dunkirk, and have been in again since
D-Day. They are having one swell time taking back the ground they were
forced to lose in the early campaign. They swore they would come back
again, and they have kept their word.</p>

<p>We shoved off again at 10:00 A.M. yesterday&mdash;got here at Bolbec
at twelve-thirty. The enemy held the town only six days ago. I went
over to the theater to see what it was like, and as usual found no
lights, no water, and everything soaking wet. We had three bulbs
connected on a cord which had been given to us at Lion-sur-Mer by the
R.E.M.E. So I got them out of the truck, connected them to one empty
socket in the ceiling, and oh, wonder of wonders, they worked!</p>

<p>I then swept out the room, found an awful old carpet up on the stage
and put it down amid clouds of dust and fleas. But at least
Zo&Atilde;&laquo; and I had some sort of a room to dress in. We have no
manager or stage manager with us. Leslie has to tune the piano always
and often has to go out and <i>find</i> one. We all do everything for
ourselves, and I'm the one who does the scrounging.</p>

<p>I found an old Frenchwoman on the way to the theater who was ironing
in her window. So I went in, offered her some soap flakes which I had,
and she promised to do some laundry for us. It is getting colder.</p>

<p>We are giving two shows a day, at three o'clock and at six-thirty,
and the place is <i>jammed</i>. They come in direct from the line, some
all bound up, dirty, tired, but all in great spirits, and they sing as
though their lungs must burst. It's great to be with them, and all
grouses disappear once the show is on. If they can take it, we most
surely can. I have only a little more time over here before returning
to London and to the U.S.A. to fulfill my contract. But hardships all
considered, I am beginning to wish I could stay, and hang my panties on
the Siegfried Line.</p>

<p>I wish somebody&mdash;anybody&mdash;could come and see what our
little unit can do. Three in the orchestra&mdash;piano, violin, and
drums. And three others&mdash;Basil, Zo&Atilde;&laquo; and me. No
bally-hoo, no fuss, no publicity. In the daytime we share our rations
of white bread, chocolate, and cigarettes with the village children.
They have had no white bread since the German occupation&mdash;some
have never before tasted chocolate. The eternal cry is "Cigarettes for
Papa." The &Atilde;&copy;vacu&Atilde;&copy;es still are coming in on
foot from Le Havre. I got my new ration of chocolate, sweets, and
biscuits today, and took them down to the street outside our hotel. The
children appeared from everywhere like London sparrows, and the ration
is now <i>fini!</i></p>

<p>Last night we had supper at the ch&Atilde;&cent;teau now occupied by
the Royal Artillery Anti-Tank Corps. It was exciting because several of
the officers had just come back from Le Havre where they saw the
surrender of the German general.</p>

<p>There was a wood fire blazing in the great fireplace of the
ch&Atilde;&cent;teau and I practically sat in it. The cold, penetrating
dampness is becoming worse each day. I have no warm pajamas or cardigan
and can't get any. Today I lined my shoes with newspaper to keep my
feet warm. I dare not risk catching a cold or even the sniffles. My job
is to sing and look glamorous. Not too easy in the conditions we are
living and traveling under.</p>

<p>When I heard they had a real bath with hot water at the
ch&Atilde;&cent;teau I immediately set about making myself as charming
and popular as possible to soften up the territory preparatory to
making a request for a half-hour in the tub.</p>

<p><i>Later:</i> Alas, for my hopes of a bath. The heavy tanks coming
from Le Havre have broken the water mains.</p>

<p>This business of being without water is worse than all other
discomforts. We all have <i>l'estomac de Normandie</i> again, and the
sanitary facilities are practically nonexistent.</p>

<p>I discovered a row of three evil-smelling, ramshackle outhouses, all
open at the top, behind the theater where we are doing our show. These
were used by troops and civilians. The arrangement is decidedly
primitive&mdash;no seat, just a hole in the ground and two places for
your feet. You simply crouch and let nature take its course.</p>

<p>Humiliating as it was to have to resort to these measures, I could
have borne that had I not suddenly become aware that I was not alone.
The cubicle beside mine was also occupied. There I stood, undecided
whether to make a dash for it or to wait until the man left. If I
dashed, I might run into him. I could only pray that when I made my
entrance on the line: "Here she comes, our own glamorous Gertrude
Lawrence," my neighbor would not recognize me from our last informal
meeting!</p>

<p>So I stayed. Hours, it seemed. Men came and went. Dysentery is no
respecter of persons. Finally, with only fifteen minutes to show time,
I bolted from my cubicle, like the mechanical hare at a greyhound race,
and sprinted over the uneven ground to the back door of the theater. I
was safe.</p>

<p>Yesterday at Foreshon the stage was twelve feet from the floor. No
one had fixed the lights and everything was filthy. Zo&Atilde;&laquo;
and I wanted to get our things into the dressing room but could do
nothing in the dark. While waiting for an electrician to turn up, we
pulled off our coats and pushed the seats closer to the stage. We were
only six entertainers in that vast place. Even if the "mike" could be
made to work, we had to have the men nearer to us.</p>

<p>Still no one showed up to fix the lights.</p>

<p>"Let's see what we can do," said Zo&Atilde;&laquo;.</p>

<p>Armed with flashlights, she and I went below and poked about in the
debris until we discovered a small room with a sink and one
electric-light socket. We attached to this our three bulbs on their
flexible cord. Those emergency lights and my make-up kit were the most
important part of my baggage. We tied the cord to a pipe running round
the room and hoped the bulbs would work if&mdash;and when&mdash;the
juice was turned on.</p>

<p>By this time the men were already lining up for the show. The first
comers lifted the piano onto the stage for us. Meanwhile, Basil arrived
and put up two posters so the men would know what they were going to
see.</p>

<p>At this moment the electrician showed up. He informed us that the
lighting system was controlled from Bolbec, six miles away. He had to
go there to get permission to turn it on, <i>if it would turn
on</i>.</p>

<p>He left, and we sat down to wait, dirty, tired, and frayed at the
nerve ends. No one was in a welcoming mood when the Public Relations
officer put in an appearance and said, reproachfully, he had the
cameraman in tow and they had been chasing us all over France. And
would we please come out at once and have the pictures done. You don't
say "I won't" to a three-pipper, so we posed with the boys. I tried to
look glamorous, though most of my make-up was gone, and the dust of the
cellar had not improved my appearance.</p>

<p>Finally the lights came on, and we all rushed below to dress. The
men poured into the theater, and once again the spirit of the trouper
rose to its usual heights.</p>

<p>Just as we were about to begin, our driver discovered that the
"mike" was not working again. It was too late to do anything about it,
the show had to go on. So we started, but one by one we died at our
posts. Not a sound could be heard from any of us in that huge place.
The men became restless, and no wonder.</p>

<p>We got it over, and then I struck. "No show tonight unless the mike
is fixed." After all, as someone pointed out, there were some six
hundred technicians within call, who could easily fix the mike for
us.</p>

<p>We were drinking welcome cups of real tea&mdash;our first since
leaving England&mdash;when suddenly a voice boomed out above us:
"Hello, testing. Hello, testing."</p>

<p>A sergeant had changed a valve in the mike outfit and it worked.</p>

<p>So we put on another show at once for the newly arrived
audience.</p>

<p>This time everything started beautifully. The overture was O.K. We
heard Clarence announce: "Joe Nicholls, the well-known London drummer."
At this every light in the place went off.</p>

<p>Zo&Atilde;&laquo; and I sat in our dressing room in stunned silence,
knowing that the switch was controlled from Bolbec, six miles away.</p>

<p>We could hear Joe drumming in the dark. How did he do it? We found
out later&mdash;he stood close to the mike and played on his big strong
teeth! And he kept it up until the lights came on again. We finished
the show.</p>

<p>The E.N.S.A. shows are supposed to be only for the troops. Now and
then you see a civilian seated among the boys. There was one little old
lady in the audience at Etretat. She had billeted our unit and had
helped us greatly. During the four years of German occupation she had
refused to see a show. Now she sat in the front row, smiling broadly
and trying to join in the singing of "Tipperary," while the tears
rolled down her cheeks.</p>

<br>


<p>Driving north toward Belgium, we made a triumphal progress through
towns which had been in German hands only a few days before.</p>

<p>As we made our way slowly down the main street, avoiding a few shell
holes, men, women, and children turned out to greet us. We all bowed
and smiled.</p>

<p>"I know now how the Queen feels at the opening of Parliament," said
Zo&Atilde;&laquo;.</p>

<p>Our destination was Brussels. Other than that we knew nothing. But
it was enough. Brussels had just been liberated, the front was very
close, we would be entertaining men straight from the fighting line. At
Lille, where we put up for the night, no billets had been arranged for
us, as the enemy had withdrawn too short a time before. However,
Clarence knew the city and was able to guide us to a hotel where they
made room for us. Everywhere people were breathless at the speed with
which the Allies were advancing.</p>

<p>Just before the outskirts of Brussels Bayliss said: "There's Major
Jamieson." He had just passed us in his jeep and honked for us to stop.
Our spirits were in good shape but our stomachs were empty. This seemed
a happy chance, and Captain Bayliss got out. While he and Jamieson met
in private conference, we sat like good children in a school bus and
waited.</p>

<p>Then Jamieson came to the door of our car and said, "Everything all
right?" I suppose we nodded, and he went on gaily: "Wonderful hotel for
you all laid on in Brussels. Glorious new theater. There's hot and cold
water. And light. Mrs. Herbert is there."</p>

<p>We stared at him. It sounded too good to be true&mdash;<i>hot and
cold water!</i></p>

<p>He then dashed off and we crashed into a flood of questions to
Bayliss: "Where are we staying? For how long?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. My orders are to deliver you to Colonel Haggarth on
arrival, and the show is at seven-thirty tonight."</p>

<p>We had by now come two hundred and sixty miles, had started off that
morning without even a warm drink. It was already one-fifteen and we
had to report to the colonel even before going to our hotel. On top of
this, we were expected to give a performance at night in clothes that
had been packed up for two days. Everybody in the coach vowed that
there could not possibly be a show that night.</p>

<p>Brussels was holding carnival with flags, crowds, and the White
Brigade patrolling the streets, rounding up collaborationists.</p>

<p>As our truck came to a standstill in the Grand' Place, people
gathered around, demanding to know the meaning of E.N.S.A. on our
shoulders. None of us could tell them, so we got out, did a few dance
steps, and said "Cabaret."</p>

<p>They understood that all right. To make it all clear I added:</p>

<p>"<i>Cabaret pour le soldat.</i>"</p>

<p>A cheer went up. Then immediately a clamor began: "<i>Cigarettes?
Chocolat? Savon?</i>" Hundreds of hands stretched out.</p>

<p><i>Savon</i>&mdash;soap&mdash;was what I wanted too. That and
gallons of hot water, and a bed to stretch my aching body on. Captain
Bayliss had gone in search of the colonel to report us and there were
no signs of his return. Basil was in a towering rage, Zo&Atilde;&laquo;
fidgeted&mdash;she wanted to go to the lavatory and nobody could find
one. Clarence and Joe and Leslie philosophically went to sleep.</p>

<p>Presently Bayliss came back and said the colonel was at lunch, but a
corporal had told him we were all billeted at the Hotel Metropole,
which turned out to be a vast place but completely deserted. The
proprietor looked uneasy and said a room had been booked for Miss
Lawrence, but none for the rest of the party. This was strange and a
bit terrifying when I found out&mdash;as I soon did&mdash;that the
hotel was being boycotted by the Belgians as the proprietors were said
to be collaborationists.</p>

<p>I did not at all like the idea of staying there by myself.</p>

<p>However, I was famished, and the Metropole had food&mdash;soup,
salmon with mayonnaise, and dessert. Price per person, one hundred
francs. We were just beginning on this ruinously expensive meal when in
walked Lieutenant Charles Rogers, whom we'd last seen in the Orkneys.
He said the others had been billeted at the Royal Nord, and I said
quickly:</p>

<p>"Then I'll go there. They'll have to find a place for me there. I
won't stay anywhere without my unit."</p>

<p>He agreed to take me, and then we got out all our money to pay our
lunch bill. There was a fuss over this, as neither Bayliss nor I nor
Charles Rogers had any Belgian money, and the proprietor at first
refused to accept French money.</p>

<p>We were impatient to get going and to unpack because Charles had
told us we had to give a show that night. Fourteen thousand troops were
in the city. Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands was also there to
celebrate the landing of British air-borne troops in Holland.</p>

<p>"I came here to entertain the troops, not to entertain royalty," I
said snappily. "But if it's an Army order&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is," said Charles.</p>

<p>Finally we got away from the horrible Metropole and I was given a
room at the Royal Nord with the gang.</p>

<p>Brussels had a curfew. We were warned that a lot of shootings took
place at night. Our soldiers went about with rifles. The city had no
tea, no coffee, no butter, no bread. But it had water and lights. And
real, clean beds. Breakfast next morning was doubtful. I made a glass
of tea in my room and drank it with a German field-ration biscuit which
we had found at Lion-sur-Mer and which I had brought along as a
souvenir. The tea&mdash;one teaspoonful of the real commodity&mdash;was
given me by Zo&Atilde;&laquo; I made a tea bag of make-up muslin and
heated the water in my field mess can on a German stove.</p>

<p>The performance that night was in a theater about the size of the
Radio City Music Hall in New York. So long as the Germans occupied
Brussels, Belgians were not allowed there, so, since we took over, the
colonel had decided civilians should be admitted to shows. A van with a
loudspeaker announcing the show had gone through the streets, so the
house was filled. <i>But</i> no troops. And no Prince Bernhard. Just a
few R.A.F. on the side aisles.</p>

<p>Of course we did the show in English. It didn't matter when we sang.
But Basil, who is a patter comedian, was up against it. He solved this
by raising his opera hat when he came on and saying politely, "<i>Vive
la Belgique.</i>"</p>

<p>That brought enormous applause, and after that whatever Basil said
was received enthusiastically by the audience who could not have
understood a single word of it.</p>

<p>At seven-thirty last night&mdash;in the theater, while I was waiting
to go on&mdash;none other than Colonel Haggarth <i>himself</i> came to
me with an urgent plea that I stay for another three days and go into
Antwerp! Three thousand Canadians have just come in from the front
line, and even though the enemy was only three miles outside the city
they wanted a show and had asked for the Gertrude Lawrence Unit.</p>

<p>I quickly wrote out two cables to be sent through the War Office in
London: one to Gilbert Miller, who was expecting me daily to start
rehearsals on a new play, and the other to Richard, telling of the
colonel's request.</p>

<p>We drove the forty-five kilometers from Brussels to Antwerp and put
on our shows at the E.N.S.A. Music Hall. It was my farewell performance
on the Western Front, and it was played to the accompaniment of
gunfire. British tanks of the Guards' armored division had captured the
city proper just twenty days before, but the Germans were still in
command of the suburb of Merxem. This put Von Rundstedt approximately
three thousand yards from the theater.</p>

<p>The hall was packed with Canadians and a dash of British and Yanks.
I made my entrance to the last eight bars of "Some Day I'll Find You,"
and swung immediately into "A Lovely Way to Spend an Evening."</p>

<p>"Isn't it," I thought, as a shell burst close by. I asked over the
footlights: "Is there a Joe in the house? Anybody here named Joe?"</p>

<p>Of course there was; there always is. He was sitting in the second
row, which made it easy to sing directly to him: "A Guy Named Joe." He
slumped down in his seat and I could see his neck and ears get red, but
the other fellows enjoyed his discomfiture as much as the song itself
and joined in the chorus. Then an E.N.S.A. corporal unrolled a placard
with the words of the song on it.</p>

<p>I called on six soldiers from the front row to help hold the
placard. They leaped the footlights, among them Joe from the second
row. We put on an impromptu skirmish, to the delight of the rest of the
house, and the six went back to their seats with an imprint of my best
lipstick on their cheeks.</p>

<p>I used up a lot of lipstick on my tour of the Western Front. In
camps where we played two shows in quick succession I decorated more
soldiers than General Eisenhower had to date.</p>

<p>The program ended with a singsong, including "Irish Eyes," "You Made
Me Love You," "Wee Doch-an-Dorris," and "Tipperary." Finally we sang
"I'll See You Again," and I thought to myself: it's a promise and a
prayer.</p>

<br>


<p>I am writing this in the plane on my way back to America.</p>

<p>My service on the Western Front is over. I hope I have repaid some
of what I owed to those British Tommies of World War I who dug into
their breeches pockets and brought forth the half crowns and shillings
that paid my fare to London and my first real chance in <i>Charlot's
Revue</i>.</p>

<p>England is my country, but I am married to an American. Now that I
have done my bit for E.N.S.A., I hope the U.S.O. will send me out with
a show to entertain the American boys. I would like to serve both
countries that I love and belong to.</p>

<p>The Atlantic, which seems not nearly so wide now as it once was, is
below me at this minute. Our plane purrs softly through banks of cloud.
Its shining nose is pointed westward.</p>

<p>The skipper has just paused beside my seat and whispered
confidentially: "Lunch in New York tomorrow."</p>
