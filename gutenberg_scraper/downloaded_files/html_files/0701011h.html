<h2>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h2>

<h3>From the "Australian Writers Series," <i>The
Australasian</i>, Melbourne, 3 June 1939.</h3>

<div align="center">

<hr>

<p class="first">THE name of Erle Cox is well known to readers of
<i>The Australasian</i>, by reason of his weekly book review, and
is also familiar to a wide public through the medium of his own
books, especially "Out of the Silence," which has
maintained&mdash; and is maintaining&mdash;a steady sale over a
period of 20 years or so, something unusual in these days of mass
production and short lives in novels.</p>

<p>He needs, therefore, little introduction to you as a name, but
here he is as a personality, looking, in the opinion of Esther
Paterson, who here depicts him, somewhat like John Galsworthy
facially, though any resemblance does not extend to the top of
the head&mdash;Mr. Cox's being covered with a vigorous growth of
hair.</p>

<p>He was born in Melbourne, and on leaving school went on to the
land as a vine grower at Rutherglen, on the Victorian side of the
Murray. But though there producing the "subtle alchemist," he was
also developing his own powers of alchemy, transmuting the drab
of daily experience into verse and story. For writing was in his
blood. His paternal grand father, who was an official with the
Astoria Co., a fur-trading rival to the Hudson Bay Company, wrote
a book on the Columbia River, which was published in 1831. And
his father, Boss Cox, was also a well-known writer in
Melbourne.</p>

<p>So during the 10 years he was vine growing at Rutherglen he
wrote, and continued doing so when he went into business in
Tasmania later. His short stories first found publication in the
<i>Lone Hand</i>, and from then on he wrote stories and verse for
various papers in Australia, beginning to write "Oriel" verse for
<i>The Argus</i> in 1918, following attention attracted to his
verse when he won a competition for an Anzac memorial poem. He
continued to write "Oriel" verses weekly for more than 18
years.</p>

<p><i>Out of the Silence</i>, Erle Cox's first imaginative novel,
was written over a long period during the years between 1913 and
1918. It appeared as a serial in <i>The Argus</i> in 1919, and
was published in book form in 1924, having had a steady sale ever
since. </p>

<p><i>Fool's Harvest</i>, striking a warning note to Australia in
an imagined invasion by the Cambasians, also first appeared as a
serial in <i>The Argus</i>. It was first published in book form
early this year. </p>

<p>Now Erle Cox has another novel nearing completion, again an
imaginative story, with the probable title of <i>The Missing
Angel</i>.</p>

<p>Erle Cox writes by hand and with a pen. He cannot concentrate
on work until he is actually sitting at his desk with a pen in
his hand&mdash;but having got so far, he admits he actually
enjoys the physical work of writing. And since his readers enjoy
the results, it would appear a good state of affairs for all
concerned.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>To-know all is to forgive all. So, therefore, if you would
censure Tydvil Jones because of what happened when he made the
attempt to recapture his lost youth, you should know why and how
he lost his youth.</p>

<p>A biographical introduction to a story is always boring, but I
cannot help that. You must know how Tydvil was brought up or it
will be impossible to understand him. When you know he began life
with a handicap that not one man in a million could carry to the
winning post you will recognise that he might have been much
worse than he was.</p>

<p>To begin with Tydvil was an only child. His father was middle-
aged when Tydvil arrived, and was a man deeply absorbed in his
business. His mother was a woman of iron will and an ultra pious
disposition. That she insisted on calling her son Tydvil because
his father had been born in Merthyr Tydvil, and had her way, is
one proof of the inflexibility of her purpose.</p>

<p>It was the boy's good luck that with his mother's will he
inherited the business ability of his father. As there was not
room in one family for two will-powers such as her own, Mrs.
Jones, senior, did her best to eradicate that of her son in his
infancy; but never recognised that, though suppressed, it
remained latent.</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Jones as the moving spirit in half a dozen societies
for the moral improvement of everybody and everything, obtained
an insight into aspects of life that are usually kept decently
covered up. Not being as wise as she believed herself to be, and
seeing results without understanding causes, she was firmly
convinced that all men were brutes. She asserted her belief so
often that the natural brutality of man became the basic axiom of
her life.</p>

<p>She was determined, therefore, that her son would grow up an
exception, and took measures accordingly. It was the boy's hard
luck that; as an only child, she was able to devote her entire
attention to him while she was not otherwise engaged in reforming
society.</p>

<p>To give her her due, she was well equipped for the job. It
would have been better for Tydvil perhaps had she not been
entitled to sign herself M.A. By the time he was aged eighteen
years he was better furnished educationally than thousands of
public school boys. Otherwise the results of his home training
were deplorable beyond words.</p>

<p>He knew no other boys of his age except at long range. His
only sport was tennis played with serious-minded seniors of
either sex on the family court. On the rare occasions when he
came into contact with youths of his own age, he could not
understand them. He considered their outlook on life to be
sinful. Their opinion of him, expressed with the freedom of
youth, was far from flattering.</p>

<p>On one occasion, after reflecting on their manners and customs
to two amazed boys, he only escaped gathering the full harvest of
his temerity by one restraining the other on the plea that it was
impossible to strike a lady. They parted with him after giving
him a brief, but lurid, summary of his character that left him
pink to the ears.</p>

<p>The truth was, that at this age, a more intolerable and
obnoxious young prig than Tydvil Jones could not have been found
outside the pages of "Sanford and Merton," a literary masterpiece
that is, fortunately, forgotten by the present generation.</p>

<hr>

<a name="ch2"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>To his father, Tydvil's belated arrival had been a cause of
embarrassment rather than pleasure. He felt secretly relieved
when his wife had undertaken to deal with a domestic problem with
which he felt himself unable to cope. He had his doubts as to the
value of the boy's education at home. But he concealed them from
his wife. Thirty years of married life had made him a domestic
diplomat.</p>

<p>It was a relief, too, when his wife decided that Tydvil had
arrived at the age when he should enter his father's office. It
was his unspoken fear that his wife would demand a professional
career for their son.</p>

<p>Away back in the '50's of last century, there had been
established the firm of Craddock, Burns and Despard. The firm had
flourished exceedingly. Burns's daughter had married a Jones in
the '70's. Subsequently, through a series of vital and commercial
dissolutions, the father of Tydvil Jones became the sole partner
and owner of the firm of Craddock, Burns and Despard. The head
office was housed in a vast six-storied building, and the women
of six States paid tribute into the coffers of C. B. &amp; D.</p>

<p>For the first time in his life, Tydvil Jones came into direct
contact with his father. It was a belated contact that led to a
mutual respect, based, although they did not recognise the fact,
on mutual suffering.</p>

<p>The loosening of the apron strings, however, by no means meant
emancipation. In the warehouse, Tydvil experienced the isolation
of "the boss's son." It was the isolation of the man who would
eventually take the reins. Departmental heads who imparted
information were courteous but restrained. The general staff,
both office and warehouse, viewed his advent with suspicion.</p>

<p>The boy's natural reticence increased, and, denied friendship,
he threw himself wholeheartedly into his work. He had sufficient
sense not to make his position too obvious to the staff. The
natural ability he had inherited from his father found a proper
outlet, and it was not long before Tydvil began to make his
mark.</p>

<p>Gradually the staff recognised he was not presumptuous.
Moreover, to their great and abiding joy, they discovered that he
was innocent of the world and the flesh to an extent that was
unbelievable to a horde of average business pagans.</p>

<p>The typists found with delight that, on being spoken to by one
of them, he would blush a rosy pink. Therefore, they made
opportunities to approach him, and the eyes of a dozen other
minxes watched for the tell-tale blush.</p>

<p>There grew up around Tydvil legends of his innocence, that
lost nothing in the telling. "Have you heard Tyddie's latest?"
became a stock question. None the less, while the staff grinned
joyously at his blameless life, they began to have a real respect
for him as a business man.</p>

<p>Said one departmental head to another: "He may be a mug in
many respects, but there was nothing of the mug in the way he
handled that old swine Graham of Graham and Stone over those
contracts. You know the old man's gift of language when the
spirit moves him?"</p>

<p>The other nodded, and laughed.</p>

<p>"Well," the narrator continued, "he cut loose on young Tyddie.
He had hardly got his first 'damn,' when the lad pipes up, 'You
will be good enough not to use obscene and blasphemous language
in my office. It does not impress me, and it is offensive. Kindly
confine your remarks to business.'"</p>

<p>The listener laughed. "That must have improved the
atmosphere."</p>

<p>"A close-up of old G's face would have been worth a fortune.
He gulped out, 'I've done business with this house for five and
thirty years, and have never been spoken to like that.' 'Hump,'
snapped Tyddie, 'then it's about time someone took you in hand.
If you don't like the way I talk to you, you can get out and
close the account.'"</p>

<p>"That, to old Michael Graham?"</p>

<p>"Just that! And believe it or not, he bullied the old devil
till he didn't know whether he was awake or enjoying a nightmare.
He signed up for all the allowances we asked for and agreed to
replace the defective stuff. Tyddie may be a perfect lady, but he
is no mug."</p>

<hr>

<a name="ch3"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>In his twenty-fifth year, Tydvil Jones married. Had he been
asked at the time, he would have said he had made free selection.
Really, the choice had been his mother's. That matron was
somewhat disappointed at the result of her matchmaking.</p>

<p>She knew Amy to be very pious and serious but she under-
estimated her generalship and fighting strength. Amy suddenly
developed a will that was more inflexible than her own. In the
several ruthless but brief battles fought for the ownership of
Tydvil Jones, Amy was signally victorious.</p>

<p>The bone of contention knew nothing of the war that had been
fought. He found he had merely exchanged one domestic ruler for
another. To him the gynecocracy that would have driven another
man to drink or crime, was a normal state of affairs. The only
effect of the change was that he noticed Amy talked a good deal
more than his mother did.</p>

<p>After his marriage his home life took on a new aspect. Under
his mother's rule Tydvil had been able to avoid taking part in
her activities for the reformation of society.</p>

<p>Amy had other ideas.</p>

<p>First, she waged war on her mother-in-law to obtain control of
several of her pet societies. To give the elder woman her due,
she put up a perfectly willing fight. Outside of actual physical
violence, there was no limit to their endeavours. The war was
waged under Rafferty's rules, and Amy was again victorious.</p>

<p>What Mrs. Jones, senior, said about Mrs. Jones, junior, though
in the main true, was libellous and scathing. Indeed, there was
no need to embroider the stories, the facts were more scandalous
than anything she could have invented. Amy's methods were new and
atrocious beyond the wide experience of her vanquished mother-in-
law.</p>

<p>Who but Amy would have thought of telephoning to every one of
her mother-in-law's supporters, on the morning of a vital
meeting, that the meeting had been postponed? But Amy did that,
and came down with her own gang and elected all her own nominees
for office unopposed.</p>

<p>Partly to irritate his mother, and partly for her own
convenience, Amy enlisted Tydvil for social service. Having no
other interests outside his business, he found the work an outlet
for his surplus energies. Amy found his clear judgment no small
assistance in her campaigns.</p>

<p>Therefore, in certain circles, Tydvil Jones became a somewhat
notable figure. He studied social questions and spoke from many
platforms. He also subscribed to causes the value of which he
doubted, though at that period his doubts were kept to
himself.</p>

<hr>

<a name="ch4"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p>At the age of thirty an avalanche smote the life of Tydvil
Jones. In the one six months he lost both his parents. Early in
the year, a moment of indecision settled the fate of his mother.
The driver of the motor car was severely censured by the coroner,
though the jury brought in a verdict of misadventure.</p>

<p>Just six months later, his father relinquished his life as
unobtrusively as he had lived. Their actual loss had little
effect on their son. Neither had been demonstratively
affectionate. None the less, the result was to sweep Tydvil from
a harbour of comparative calm into an ocean of serious
responsibilities.</p>

<p>He knew when he succeeded to the control of Craddock, Burns
and Despard, that his father's death had made him a wealthy man.
But when the figures relating to the estate were known, confreres
of the deceased merchant opened their eyes with astonishment, and
the State Treasurer of the day licked his lips over the death
duties.</p>

<p>Thanks to his previous attitude towards his staff, the
succession of Tydvil Jones to the throne of C. B. &amp; D. was
accomplished without friction or unrest. Despite its great
prosperity, the thirty years of conservative autocracy of the
late ruler lay heavily on the warehouse. Without undue haste, and
carefully feeling his way, the new ruler instituted reforms that
sent a sigh of relief from basement to roof.</p>

<p>But, from the day he assumed the reins, Tydvil began to live a
double life&mdash;but not in the usually accepted sense of the
term. One was the domestic life in which he was the subject of an
autocrat. The other, his real life, was as ruler of an
establishment capitalised at three-quarters of a million, and
controlling the destinies of some four hundred fellow beings.</p>

<p>From his elevated position his horizon was enlarged. He came
into direct contact with his peers in business, who received him
with some circumspection, having heard stories of his peculiar
views. It was not long before they recognised that he was a man
not to be despised in the game of buying and selling by which
they all made a more or less honest living.</p>

<p>Outside their common interest, however, they were at a loss
what to make of him, and he could not understand them. But after
relinquishing the first very natural idea that he was pulling
their legs, they summed him up as a most amazing prig.</p>

<p>There was some justification for their verdict. He had been
brought up to believe that a theatre was a vestibule to Hades,
and shared with race-courses and hotels the distinction of
wearing the hall-marks of depravity. If you hammer a doctrine,
however fantastic, into a human being from childhood, it will
take an immense amount of eradicating.</p>

<p>But, in these early days of his responsibilities, Tydvil did a
lot of quiet thinking and observing. It did not take him long to
arrive at the conclusion that it was he and not his business
associates who were abnormal. Then the revolutionary truth
gradually shaped itself in his mind, that all his life he had
allowed others to do his thinking, and he awoke to the knowledge
that all his ideas apart from his business, were second hand.</p>

<p>At home he allowed no sign of his changing ideas to be
noticed. He entered into his social activities as an observer
rather than a participator. His admiration for his associates
faded when he noticed how they fawned on Amy. He also awoke to
the fact that it was the cheque book of Tydvil Jones rather than
Tydvil Jones himself that commanded the respect given to him. He
obtained a good deal of cynical amusement from watching how
eagerly Amy lapped up the flattery of her friends.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Tydvil began to study his wife.
But it was a study of her habits and customs and not a study of
her comfort. Amy was good looking; there was no doubt about that.
But there were lines about her mouth that were seldom seen by
anyone but her husband. They showed up immediately he questioned
any act or opinion of hers. When her friends complimented him on
the unfailing sweetness of "dear Amy," Jones agreed cheerfully
and dutifully, but the thought of those lines was always in the
background.</p>

<p>Few but he recognised the diamond hardness of the sweet nature
of Amy. He had occasionally met other women who took the good
things of life thankfully and graciously. They were women who
laughed naturally and who did not want to reform society.</p>

<p>Once, experimentally, he suggested a modification of her
Spartan hair dressing and more expensive frocks. After Amy's
first shock of surprise, her discourse on frivolous dressing
lasted for 45 minutes. Who had hinted she was unbecomingly
clothed? Had she ever shown a tendency to extravagance? Nothing
but her knowledge of his impeccable life saved him from a
suspicion of having sideslipped from grace. Indeed, her
insistence on returning to the subject of the reasons for his
suggestion awoke in Jones the thought that she would find the
pain of a misdemeanour eased by the joy of reforming him, if
necessary.</p>

<p>However, as he listened to her homily, he tried, without much
success, to reconcile her ideas of economy in dress with a
twenty-roomed house, three motor cars and eight maids.</p>

<hr>

<a name="ch5"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>However, Tydvil's study of Amy led him to the discovery that
though he had been married to her for six years, he knew very
little of his wife. It was a little disconcerting at first to
realise that she was no saint, and that in pursuit of her
objectives her methods were, to put it mildly, peculiar.
Recollections of passages between Amy and his mother, unnoticed
at the time, strengthened this conviction.</p>

<p>Then the discovery of a letter from his mother to his father
opened his eyes still wider. It narrated the episode of Amy's
telephone tactics before referred to, and wound up with a summary
of Amy's character as it appeared to the writer: "A more selfish,
deceitful and hard-hearted woman never existed. I feel that her
piety is the grossest hypocrisy, and that faith and charity are
as far beyond her as my poor son is beyond hope in her
hands."</p>

<p>Allowing for his mother's habit of emphasis, Jones was forced
to conclude that there was something in the unflattering sketch
of Amy. Then he remembered his father's self-effacement, and he
saw a light. As he ripped the letter viciously to pieces, for the
first time in his life, at the age of thirty-two years, Tydvil
Jones swore. "No more! No more!" he said aloud, bringing his
clenched fist down on the table before him, "I'm damned if I'll
stand it any longer!" The trouble was, that Tydvil learned he had
been robbed of his youth and the joy of living it. That the
robbery was committed with pious intent, was no salve to his
feelings. Affection may have misled his mother, but Amy had been
an accessory, not for love, but ambition. It was not sweet to
realise that he was subject for amused pity among the men he met
in business. The worst of it was he felt his case was beyond
remedy.</p>

<p>Two incidents occurred about this time that made him resolve
on emancipation. In both of these he was an unwilling
eavesdropper.</p>

<p>One night, while returning home from a meeting, he entered an
empty railway compartment. At the next station, two men, well
known to him, took the adjoining compartment. When he recognised
their voices, he was prevented from making his presence known by
their first words, evidently the continuation of a discussion.
"Tydvil Jones&mdash;heavens, what a name!&mdash;is a hopeless
wowser. And I can't stand a wowser."</p>

<p>The rest of the conversation came in illuminating patches. "I
don't believe he ever..." What it was, the angry listener could
not catch, but the shout of mirth that accompanied the expression
of unbelief, made Tydvil's blood boil. "McRae or Daglish should
take him in hand and complete his education..."</p>

<p>"He would be an awfully decent fellow if someone would de-
moralise him."</p>

<p>Fortunately, in the midst of ribald suggestions for the
improvement of Tydvil Jones, the train drew up at a platform, and
the subject of their speculations, stooping low, fled.</p>

<p>The second incident was far more pleasant, and gave Tydvil
even more food for reflection.</p>

<p>One evening he was working back in his office some time after
the staff had left. Through a mind concentrated on his work, he
became conscious of voices near him, but for some time their
purport did not sink in. Then suddenly, without volition, he
found himself alert and listening to the words, "Well, anyhow,
Tyddie is a dear in spite of his innocence."</p>

<p>The voice was that of his senior typist. In a moment he
realised that to make his presence known at that juncture would
be exceedingly embarrassing both to himself and the speaker. With
a grim smile, he felt that, of the two, he would suffer the more
acutely. He hoped the conversation would lose its very personal
note.</p>

<p>But the next words convinced him that the hope was vain. "I'll
bet," came a second voice, and he recognised the accents of that
impertinent little Miss Marsden, "that no one has ever told
Tyddie how good looking he is. I just love the way his hair
waves, and those brown eyes of his. Did you ever notice what a
kissable mouth he has?"</p>

<p>The listening man felt perspiration on his forehead. Then came
the voice of the senior typist. "Why don't you tell him that,
Jess?"</p>

<p>There was a ripple of happy laughter, and Jess replied: "Poor
Tyddie! If I told him that I would be tried for manslaughter.
Tyddie would perish from spontaneous combustion brought on by his
own blushes."</p>

<p>Little Miss Jessica Marsden never knew how near she was to
bringing about that catastrophe. "It's a jolly shame to think
he's tied up to Amy," from the senior typist. "My sister, Jean,
was at school with her, and she says that Amy wasn't fit for
human consumption." Jones started, and drew a deep breath. This
was getting home with a vengeance.</p>

<p>"She is a beast," commented Jess simply and sincerely.</p>

<p>The senior typist took up the tale. "It gives me the pip to
see her come sailing along with her condescending&mdash;'Is Mr.
Jones in his office, my dear?'"</p>

<p>The words were such a perfect imitation of his wife's voice,
that it took Jones all his time to keep still. "Pity she can't
get someone to tell her how to dress herself."</p>

<p>Jessica echoed the wish, and went on, "I always call them the
beauty and the beast. It's a reversal of roles, but it's
accurate."</p>

<p>The voices died away down the empty warehouse. When he was
sure they had departed, the sole partner of Craddock, Burns and
Despard drew a long breath of relief. The next thing he did was
rather unusual for him. He rose and walked across the room to the
mirror that hung over the fixed basin behind the screen in the
corner. Jones surveyed his reflection long and earnestly. Whether
Miss Marsden's judgments were right, he was too modest to decide.
But he did think that thirty-three years of sober and upright
living had left him looking curiously youthful. The discovery was
not unpleasing.</p>

<p>On the following Friday evening when the senior typist and
that impudent little Miss Marsden received their pay envelopes,
they were amazed to find a wholly unexpected and totally
unaccountable increase of ten shillings a week in their
salaries.</p>

<p>Had they known that the portent announced the awakening of
Tydvil Jones, they would have been still more bewildered.</p>

<a name="ch6"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>So now we see why Tydvil Jones was ripe for rebellion against
life in general, and his wife in particular. He felt he had had a
raw deal. He did not quite know what to do about it, but he was
determined to do something, and in the humour he was in, he did
not care much what he did.</p>

<p>The overdue explosion occurred about a fortnight after the
episode of the two typists. He entered his breakfast room, as
usual, the first arrival. It was Amy's practice to appear at
breakfast always, but unless she had something particular to say
to him, usually annoying, she seldom arrived on the scene until a
few minutes before he was timed to depart for his office.</p>

<p>She did not like early rising, but she did like to say to her
friends, "I think, my dear, it is a wife's duty to give her
husband her society at breakfast." She considered it marked her
as a devoted spouse who was willing to sacrifice her comfort for
her husband's pleasure. She certainly did sacrifice her comfort,
but whether Tydvil found pleasure in it is open to argument.</p>

<p>The maid who attended to his simple wants found the master
unusually unresponsive. He was as much loved by his household
staff as Amy was disliked&mdash;which says volumes for his
popularity. Tydvil had slept badly, and was still simmering from
a domestic argument of the previous night.</p>

<p>There was, among others, an institution known as the Moral
Uplift Society, of which Amy was president. Its aim was to assist
unfortunate girls, who had run off the rails, back to the tracks
of righteousness. Jones had, on several occasions, contributed
lavishly to its upkeep. A quiet investigation, however, had
suggested to him, that though its expenditure was real, the
results accruing from its efforts were doubtful.</p>

<p>His insistence on being given some concrete evidence of its
usefulness was met with replies so vague, and so conflicting,
that he arrived at the conclusion that its secretary was a son of
Ananias, and several of the helpers were daughters of Sapphira.
Moreover, his requests for a balance sheet had been fruitless,
though he admired the skill with which his curiosity on the
subject was baffled.</p>

<p>For several days Amy had been angling for a cheque for one
thousand pounds for the Moral Uplift Society. Usually he
submitted to her exactions patiently. This time, however, she met
with a flat refusal until he had seen a balance sheet prepared by
his own auditor.</p>

<p>Amy was annoyed, but had no misgivings as to the outcome of
Tydvil's extraordinary stubbornness. On the previous evening she
had given up an engagement to devote herself seriously to the
matter. From eight o'clock until ten-thirty, when he fled to his
room, still recalcitrant, and locked himself in&mdash;and her
out&mdash;she had wrought with him faithfully. He had remained
silent, sullen and unyielding under the ordeal by tongue.</p>

<p>All this may explain, if it does not excuse, the outburst of
Tydvil Jones as his eyes ran over the columns of the newspaper
the maid had placed beside his plate. Suddenly he sat erect. He
dropped his half lifted cup back into the saucer with a clash of
china and jingle of silver that shattered the dignified silence
of the room.</p>

<p>In both hands he grabbed the paper, and glared at it with
incredulous eyes. It was no wonder he doubted their accuracy, for
he read, under triple and flattering headlines, the following
paragraph: "Members and friends of the Moral Uplift Society
passed a hearty vote of thanks to Mr. Tydvil Jones, the well
known philanthropist, at their monthly meeting yesterday
afternoon. Mrs. Tydvil Jones, the president of the Society, read
a letter from her husband in which he offered a donation of one
thousand pounds to be used for any purpose the committee may
direct. This is the third cheque for a similar amount which Mr.
Jones has contributed to the funds of the society."</p>

<p>"That well known philanthropist, Mr. Tydvil Jones," read that
paragraph three times before its enormity filtered thoroughly
into his system. The third time, he read it standing up. The
startled maid regarded her employer with wide-eyed concern. She
thought he was choking, so suffused had his face become. Then the
long suppressed volcanic eruption took place. Tydvil hurled the
newspaper to the floor and ground it tinder his heel. This was
bad enough, but his language..."It's an outrage!" he shouted. "A
damned outrage and a damned conspiracy! Not a penny! Not one
damned penny!"</p>

<p>Fate decreed that, at that moment Amy entered the room and
both saw and heard her husband's demonstration. It was only when
his wife had advanced towards the table that he was aware of her
presence. Not that that made any difference, Tydvil was beyond
caring two hoots for Amy or anyone else.</p>

<p>Scenting battle, the wide-eyed maid fled&mdash;but not out of
earshot. Amy advanced, showing no sign of emotion, and, stooping
down, drew the newspaper from under her husband's foot.
Deliberately she smoothed out the creases of the torn page, and
quietly placed it on the table. Then, as quietly, she walked
round the table and took her seat. She leaned back in her chair
with her cold eyes fixed on his flushed face. There was a long
thirty seconds' silence.</p>

<p>Then Amy spoke calmly, "I am waiting, Tydvil."</p>

<p>"For what?" he snapped.</p>

<p>"For your apology." Her eyes never left his for a moment.</p>

<p>"Then you'll wait a dashed long time!" He had leaned towards
her with both hands resting on the edge of the table, and his
out-thrust chin gave him an unusually bellicose air.</p>

<p>The lines about Amy's mouth hardened. Her lips compressed to a
straight pink line, and there was cold fury in her grey eyes.
Very few of her friends would have recognised "Dear Amy" at that
moment.</p>

<p>"I think, Tydvil, dear," she said evenly, though the white
knuckles clenched on the arm of her chair showed what it cost to
control her voice&mdash;"I think, Tydvil, dear, that you have
been overworking yourself. I will ask Dr. Morris to call this
evening. Perhaps a holiday will be necessary.</p>

<p>"Morris, be hanged!" he snorted.</p>

<p>Amy raised her brows slightly. "Perhaps, my dear Tydvil," she
knew of old how the reiterated "Dear Tydvil" grated, "you will
explain the cause of your irritation. Your conduct may be, indeed
is, unpardonable." She waved a hand slightly and went on, "I am
quite unused, as you know, to hearing such language. Neither am I
used to being sworn at before my servants."</p>

<p>The statements were unassailable facts. Usually she would have
side-tracked Tydvil into a defence that he had not sworn at her.
But he was too full of wrath to be distracted by minor issues. He
snatched up the crumpled paper and, in a voice that she scarcely
recognised, he read that outrageous paragraph aloud. "What's the
meaning of that infernal falsehood?" he demanded. "You know I
have refused to subscribe to that den of racketeers. Eh? Eh?"</p>

<p>There was a nasty little smile on the corners of Amy's lips as
she answered.</p>

<p>"The paragraph is quite in order, my dear Tydvil. It states
what actually took place at our meeting yesterday." She paused,
and the smile deepened. "Indeed, I handed the paragraph into the
newspaper offices myself."</p>

<p>"Meeting&mdash;yesterday&mdash;afternoon!" He gasped his
surprise with each word. "You told me you knew I particularly
wished to be present. You told me yourself it
was&mdash;postponed." Amazement struggled with his wrath.</p>

<p>Amy nodded slightly, quite unabashed. "I am quite aware of
that, as I was aware that you intended to make a very
disagreeable fuss over a quite unnecessary balance sheet. I most
strongly object to your interference in matters in any of my
societies that do not concern you."</p>

<p>Staring at her, open mouthed, Tydvil sank slowly back into his
chair. "But the letter!" he gasped, "the letter..."</p>

<p>"I saw to that, too." She spoke as though humouring a petulant
child.</p>

<p>Jones turned the revelation over in his mind. "Do you mean to
tell me you wrote that letter yourself?" he said at last.</p>

<p>She nodded. "I typed it myself, and read it to the meeting. It
was not signed, and no one saw it but myself."</p>

<p>"And," his voice shook with his rising wrath again, "you
expect me to hand over that cheque!"</p>

<p>She nodded emphatically. "I most certainly do."</p>

<p>"Then let me tell you this," he shouted, thumping the table
while everything on it jangled to his blows, "I'll see you to
Jericho before I give you a farthing; and you can explain why as
you dashed well please."</p>

<p>"After the publicity the matter has been given, you will find
it rather awkward to say that you have changed your mind." Amy
smiled her derision.</p>

<p>Jones pressed his finger furiously on the bell button. The
maid arrived with a rapidity that would have excited suspicion
had either combatant been in a mood to notice trifles.</p>

<p>He turned to her. "Tell Carter to bring round the single-
seater," he said abruptly. "Tell him I wish him to drive me to
the office." The girl vanished on the word.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the tension between the two increased. Up till now,
Tydvil's actions, to use diplomatic phraseology, had been merely
unfriendly. The ordering of the car had been a declaration of
war. Like some other good people, Amy's self-denial extended only
to others. She had laid it down that the exercise of the walk
along St. Kilda road to the city was necessary for his health.
Moreover, it set the staff an example of unostentation. Now, his
ordering of the car was flat and flagrant rebellion.</p>

<p>When the maid disappeared, Amy said acidly, "I think, Tydvil
dear, we have already settled the question of your using a car to
take you to the office."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm unsettling it," he snorted. He picked up the paper
and, turning a most aggressive back on his wife, he pretended to
read.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed in strained silence. The maid returned.
"The car is waiting, sir."</p>

<p>Before Jones could move, his wife said quickly, "Oh, Kate! Mr.
Jones has changed his mind. Tell Carter to take the car
back."</p>

<p>This was one of Amy's choicest methods of management. She
relied for its success on Tydvil's horror of scenes, even in
private, and felt certain he would shrink from a brawl before the
maid. But, for, once, she had misjudged the extent of the
revolt.</p>

<p>Jones sprang to his feet, and arrested the maid as she moved,
with a barked "Wait!" The girl stopped. "If you convey that
message, both you and Carter will be summarily dismissed. Bring
me my hat and coat."</p>

<p>The girl hesitated, and looked at her mistress for guidance.
She was between a horde of devils and a very deep sea. "Do you
hear me!" thundered the voice of the master, and never before had
she heard it with such a ring of fury. Suddenly she recognised
that she was a spectator to a revolution. When, a minute later,
she returned, Amy was sobbing, with her face in her plate.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tydvil! To think you would insult me before the
maids!"</p>

<p>"I haven't begun insulting you yet!" he growled truculently.
"Just wait a bit!" and he left without even glancing at her
again.</p>

<p>That he reached his office by car instead of using his legs,
added one more link to the chain of circumstances. He arrived
just twenty minutes before the time his staff had learned to
expect him, and saw certain things that were as unexpected as he
was.</p>

<hr>

<a name="ch7"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>Beside the door of Tydvil Jones's private office at the
warehouse, was a railed enclosure containing a large writing
table. This was presided over by Miss Geraldine Brand, who was a
young woman of no small importance in C. B. &amp; D. She was not
only guardian of the door, but was Tydvil's private secretary and
his link with the departmental heads.</p>

<p>The self-possessed and entirely adequate Geraldine knew as
much of Jones's affairs as did his banker or his solicitor. Heads
of departments paused at her desk and treated her as a fellow and
an equal. From her they learned if their visits were propitiously
timed.</p>

<p>Tydvil, who had tested her carefully, knew that she would
correct lapses of English in his dictation, and that she knew how
to keep silent in matters where silence was golden. She
remembered nothing which she should forget and forgot nothing she
should remember. Their relations were entirely impersonal. To
him, she was a perfect instrument for his business needs. No one
ever knew what Geraldine thought of Tydvil.</p>

<p>On the morning of the revolution, Geraldine arrived on the
stroke of nine. In the inner office she spent a few moments
patting a helmet of hair, more red than gold, into order.
Systematically she surveyed the great oaken desk, saw the date
stamp had been altered, straightened the wide blotting pad and
glanced over, the pen stand. Then she opened one of the two
office safes, and took from it two basket of papers, one of which
she placed on either side of the blotting pad. Satisfied that all
was well, she seated herself opposite the leather padded chair
for the first work of the day.</p>

<p>There was a long pause until she heard the sound of hasty
steps approaching. A junior hurried in bearing a large bag, from
which he sent an avalanche of letters on to the table in front of
Geraldine. As the boy turned away, she halted him with a
peremptory "Stop!"</p>

<p>He looked at her uneasily. "Listen, Jimmy," she said
decisively, "this is the third time in a fortnight you have kept
me waiting. If it happens again you'll be hunting another
job&mdash; understand?" She cut short a glib explanation with,
"No good, Jimmy! I've heard that yarn better told by a procession
of your pre-decessors. Your job is to have the mail on this table
at nine. Chase yourself!" The boy fled. With the deftness of long
practice, Geraldine sorted the letters into piles. Some few she
passed untouched to the blotting pad opposite. Then, taking a
long, pliant blade, she swiftly cut envelope after envelope along
three sides, leaving the contents undisturbed. As she cut them
she stacked them neatly at her right hand.</p>

<p>She was so intent on her work, that the new-corner who had
entered quietly, had ample time to enjoy the picture she made
before a movement on his part impelled her to turn. The slight
frown at the interruption changed to a smile as he walked round
the table and, without ceremony, seated himself in the chair
sacred to Tydvil Jones.</p>

<p>After the first glance, the girl had turned to her work again
without speaking. The man watched her for a while as one who
gazed on something worth seeing. Presently he said, with mock
ceremony, "Good morning, Geraldine."</p>

<p>Without pausing to look up, she said quietly, "Good morning,
Mr. Brewer." There was just enough emphasis on the prefix to
convey a rebuke.</p>

<p>The man smiled. "My name, Geraldine, happens to be William,
but it's generally Billy."</p>

<p>"And mine," the girl retorted, "happens to be Miss Brand. I
wish you would remember it.'</p>

<p>"I've a shocking memory," pleaded Billy, "and Geraldine is
about the only name I think of."</p>

<p>The letters passed swiftly through the slender white hands to
the zip-zip-zip of the flying blade. If she had noticed what he
said, she gave no sign. Brewer was silent, content in looking at
her. Presently she glanced up. "Do you realize that you are
occupying Mr. Jones's chair, and that he is likely to be in at
any moment; and also,"&mdash;she paused to draw a fresh pile of
letters towards her&mdash;"you have no business in this room
whatever."</p>

<p>Billy looked at the clock on the mantelpiece. "Oh! That one so
lovely should be so false." He chuckled. "Tyddie will not be here
for another thirty-five minutes, as you know better than I do. I
consider looking at you to be most important business. As for the
chair, it fits me admirably. So much for your objections to my
presence."</p>

<p>The girl gave a light laugh. "God gie us a guid conceit o'
orselves. You're not nearly big enough to fit that chair
comfortably, Mr. Billy Brewer."</p>

<p>"If you would admit how extremely capable I am, you would not
have said that. However, Geraldine, your attempt to hurt my
feelings has failed. Flopped! My pride remains uninjured."</p>

<p>"I don't flatter myself that anything I could say would shake
your colossal self-conceit," she retorted.</p>

<p>Billy laughed heartily. "It is not often you are really
complimentary, Geraldine..."</p>

<p>"Miss Brand," she interrupted sharply.</p>

<p>"Geraldine," he continued unmoved, "but when you are you make
a man blush."</p>

<p>"You blush!" she said scornfully. "The fact is that you think
because you are easily the best salesman in the city&mdash;I
grant you that..."</p>

<p>"Please don't!" he protested. "You make me feel dizzy."</p>

<p>"You are an ass," she said dispassionately. "Because no buyer,
man or woman, can resist your insidious influence, you think you
are big enough to run C. B. &amp; D. But you're not, my friend,
not by miles."</p>

<p>"Would that you were a buyer, Geraldine," he said, grinning
provocatively and leaning towards her. She prodded at him with
the paper knife and returned to her letters.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said presently, "you think you should be
offered a partnership."</p>

<p>"Would you accept a partnership if it were offered to you?" he
asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"Rather!" she replied incautiously.</p>

<p>"Hooray!" he exclaimed. "Then I do offer you one. Let us go
into partnership as Brewer and Brand, doing business under the
style of William Brewer&mdash;unlimited."</p>

<p>Geraldine placed the last of the letters together and leaned
back in her chair. Unabashed at the suggestion, she met his eyes
steadily. For months there had been this sparring between them.
The girl knew he was in earnest. Worse still, she had reached a
stage where she scarcely cared to analyse her own feelings. She
looked at him reflectively before speaking, and then said
deliberately, "Indeed, and how many sleeping partners would there
be in the firm?" There was no mistaking the intention or the
innuendo. Billy flushed under her unwavering eyes, and tried to
pass it off with a jest.</p>

<p>"Really, Geraldine, you shock me," he said, half laughing. "If
I am dumb, I am not deaf," she went on. "You're not dumb,
Geraldine, I'll swear you're not. I heard you speak most
distinctly just now."</p>

<p>"You think," she took up the tale, "that because people make
no comment to you, that they are blind to the habits and customs
of Mr. William Brewer. You might just as well disabuse your mind
of the idea. I believe in saying what I think."</p>

<p>"Yes," he broke in, "I have noticed that."</p>

<p>She went on without noticing the interruption. "And I'm not
blind to the fact that you have seen fit to give me the benefit
of a good deal of your society lately. If a fraction of what is
said about you is true, if you have any regard for a girl, you
can show it best by keeping away from her."</p>

<p>Billy whistled softly. "Your hand is not nearly as light as it
looks," he said. "However, I suppose none of my kind friends has
told you that I have cut out all that sort of thing these many
moons." He paused. "Just because I realised what you have just
told me. Give me a chance," he pleaded, and his voice was very
soft.</p>

<p>She shook her head and stood up. "Billy Brewer, you have been
a very bad boy, and I'd want to be very sure of you before I gave
you a chance."</p>

<p>"If you were sure?" he asked.</p>

<p>For the first time, her eyes fell. "Prove to me that I can be
sure."</p>

<p>She bent to pick up the letters from the table as he moved
round beside her. Then, thinking that direct action might succeed
where persuasion failed, Billy Brewer made a false move. As she
bent, he swiftly flung an arm round her, pinning her arms to her
side. Instantly she straightened and half turned. Billy took a
complete tactical advantage of the unguarded lips.</p>

<p>With a little cry, she wrenched her arm free. As she did so, a
strange thing happened. Brewer released her suddenly and stood
with his eyes fixed on some object over her shoulder.</p>

<p>Blind with anger, Geraldine did not notice the change in
Billy's attitude. "You brute! You utter brute!" she gasped, and,
with all her force, she struck him in the face with her clenched
hand. It was an active tennis and golf hand, and Geraldine struck
to make her mark&mdash;and did. Three times that hand landed on
the same spot before Geraldine awoke to the fact that Billy was
staring over her shoulder, and made no effort to defend himself.
He might have been cast in bronze for all the notice he took of
her enthusiastic assault.</p>

<p>Then she, too, turned, and herself became frozen into one of a
group. For, there in the doorway surveying the scene, stood
Tydvil Jones. Aye! Tydvil, who by his self made laws, should not
have arrived for another twenty minutes, at the earliest.</p>

<hr>

<a name="ch8"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p>It would be difficult to say which of the three was the most
astounded by the episode. It was Tydvil, however, who first
recovered himself. "If, Mr. Brewer, you have all you needed,
there is no reason for you to wait." The freezing politeness of
the words matched his manner. He stood aside, holding the door
open for the exit of the culprit. And&mdash;Mr. Brewer went, but
not gracefully. The flushed girl waited beside her chair as
Tydvil hung up his coat and hat. He took his seat and motioned
her to hers. As she sat down, Geraldine stammered, "Oh, Mr.
Jones&mdash;I&mdash; I."</p>

<p>He held up his hand. "I think, Miss Brand, that unless you
particularly wish to discuss the&mdash;er&mdash;episode, which, I
have no doubt, was extremely distasteful to you, we will not
refer to it--for the present, at any rate. Let us get to our mail
first."</p>

<p>Geraldine murmured her thanks, and passed the piled letters
across the table. In a few minutes they were deep in work. Long
practice and a complete understanding of his methods made words
almost unnecessary between them. Papers passed to and fro almost
in silence. Occasionally he paused to give her a note to be
brought before him later. In a remarkably short space of time,
the piled letters vanished, leaving only those that required his
personal attention. As she took the last letter from his hand,
she picked up her pencil. "Ready?" he asked. The girl nodded
assent.</p>

<p>"First," he said, "I wish you to look through all of the
morning papers for a paragraph similar to this." He passed her a
cutting. "Then send this note to the editor of each paper in
which it appears. I want this done at once, and sent out by
special messenger."</p>

<p>"To the editor.&mdash;Sir, my attention has been drawn to a
paragraph in your columns this morning which stated that I have
offered a gift of one thousand pounds to the funds of the Moral
Uplift Society. I would be pleased if you would give similar
publicity to my personal statement that I did not make any offer
of the kind. Further, I would like it to be clearly understood
that I do not intend in future to make any contributions to the
society mentioned."</p>

<p>Tydvil paused, and said smilingly, "What happens when one
burns one's boats, Miss Brand?"</p>

<p>Geraldine glanced up from her note-book. "I suppose you stay
where you are, or swim home."</p>

<p>"Exactly," he replied, "and I cannot swim."</p>

<p>That morning Geraldine found a strange indecision in Tydvil's
dictation. Usually her pencil had to fly to keep up with him, but
now, for minutes at a time, she found herself tracing patterns
with her pencil while waiting for him to continue.</p>

<p>The fact was that Tydvil had found that his skirmish with Amy,
followed so closely by the Brand-Brewer episode, had thoroughly
disjointed his normal orderly mind. For the first time since she
had taken on her duties as his secretary, he recognised that Miss
Brand was not only a young woman, but a positively beautiful
young woman. It seemed as though Brewer, by some magic, had
opened his eyes.</p>

<p>Again and again he found himself wondering how he had, until
now, overlooked the beauty of that rich head of hair. Never,
until that morning, had he observed those mischievous little
curls that nestled against her neck. Again, as he paused, his eye
was taken by the delicate line and perfect colour of the half
turned cheek.</p>

<p>Between two sentences in an important letter to the manager of
his Sydney branch, Tydvil was staggered by the intrusion of an
idea that, after all, Billy Brewer was not so much to blame for
falling from grace. This was followed by a thought still more
heinous. He found himself envying Billy's freedom to kiss a
lovely girl without disturbing his conscience; and contrasting it
with his own enthralment. Billy had lived, but he&mdash;"Phoo!"
The exclamation escaped him unconsciously.</p>

<p>At the sound, Geraldine glanced up. "I'm afraid I did not
quite catch..."</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," replied Jones, more airily than he felt, "I
did not speak."</p>

<p>At last it was over. "I do not wish to be interrupted this
morning, as I shall be busy," he said, as Geraldine picked up her
baskets full of papers and turned to leave the room.</p>

<p>At the door she hesitated and turned round. He looked at her
enquiringly.</p>

<p>"I would like to say..." Her face flushed divinely. "I mean,
that so far as I am concerned&mdash;there will be no need
to&mdash;" then, with a rush, "to say anything to Mr. Brewer
about his foolishness this morning. I am able to look after my
own interests."</p>

<p>There was a quizzical smile on the face of Tydvil Jones as he
answered, "Yes, I noticed that, too. However, I shall do as you
wish, Miss Brand." She went out and closed the door softly behind
her. For a long time Jones sat staring at it in smiling thought.
"Now, I wonder!" he said to himself. "Now, I wonder!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p>Jones turned to his work with resolution, but again and again
he found his thoughts wandering. Finally, he pushed his papers
aside impatiently and, with his elbows on his table and his head
in his hands, he surrendered to the mood of the moment. As moods
go, it was a very unchristian frame of mind in which he found
himself.</p>

<p>He knew Amy too well to flatter himself that the skirmish of
the morning could be magnified into a decisive battle. In his
mind he pictured her planning a counterattack in reply to his
success. Through his mind ran a plan of forcing her into a
position in which she would be compelled to accept a judicial
separation. It was his one hope for a peaceful life. But, as the
plan took shape, he realised that her tactics would be to throw
the odium of the legal process on him.</p>

<p>His only means of defence would be to use the weapons that Amy
would use without compunction&mdash;the stiletto and poisonous
gas. Why should he not use them? Why not? Ethically, the
suggestion might be untenable, but makers of ethics were not
married to Amy.</p>

<p>Then his mind drifted off to the scene he had witnessed an
hour earlier. It surprised him a little to think that, instead of
being righteously wrathful against Brewer, his feelings were akin
to envy. He had accepted Miss Brand's intercession as an easy way
out of a situation in which he felt unsure of himself. After all,
he thought, was he justified in judging Brewer, or any, man, by
codes that were his mother's and Amy's?</p>

<p>He remembered his father's self-effacement. Would he follow
his example and remain subservient under the domination
of&mdash;a tongue? Yes, that was all it was a tongue! He, Tydvil
Jones, head of C. B. &amp; D., with an income of fifty thousand
pounds a year, whom all his peers envied for his possessions!
Yet, he realised that not all his wealth nor all his power had
given him as much of liberty as any one of the men who did him
service.</p>

<p>The thought that the two women who might have helped him were
the ones who had led him under false standards, was very
bitter.</p>

<p>Billy Brewer would have been astounded had he known how much
of his private life was an open book to Tydvil Jones. More than
once he had been called on to "the carpet." He had come each time
with such an airy grace of gracelessness, that it disarmed
justice. Jones knew that whatever his peccadilloes, he had never
let them interfere with his work. While he did not feel inclined
to copy Billy in manner or morals, Jones recognised that Billy
knew more of life and living than an army corps of Tydvil
Joneses.</p>

<p>"Was it," Tydvil asked himself, "such a sin to kiss a pretty
girl?" He, himself, had never kissed anyone but Amy; and kissing
Amy was rather less stimulating than drinking iced water in
winter. Apparently, despite her active indignation, Geraldine
Brand did not consider it a capital offence, or she would not
have interceded on behalf of the culprit. True, Geraldine had
blushed, but he had no recollection of seeing Amy blush even as a
bride.</p>

<p>The memory of his courtship came back. His courtship! The
farce of it! He had to thank his mother for that. He remembered
how, a few days before his marriage, his mother had told him,
that if ever there were a saint, Amy was one. Saints! These
saints had stolen his boyhood and his youth. These saints had
bound him hand and foot. "If these be saints," he muttered aloud,
"may Satan himself come and free me from their works." He bowed
his head forward on his hands until it rested on his blotting
pad.</p>

<hr>

<a name="ch10"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p>Minutes passed before he moved again. At last he leaned back
with a sigh. As he did so, he started erect with an exclamation
of astonishment. In the armchair reserved for visitors at the end
of the table, sat a stranger. For a moment anger got the better
of his surprise. How could Miss Brand have dared to admit him
after the order he had given? Never before had she so lapsed from
duty. Then anger and surprise gave way to curiosity. Although
Tydvil stared in a manner in which he would scarcely have
permitted himself in ordinary circumstances, the stranger seemed
quite unabashed. He met the questioning stare frankly, with just
a flicker of amusement in his eyes.</p>

<p>The intruder was apparently tall, and slender without being
thin. As he leaned back in his chair, perfectly composed, Tydvil
was struck with a sense of latent power and authority in the man,
although there was nothing in the pose to suggest it. Tydvil
seldom took particular notice of another man's appearance, but
the distinction of his visitor's person forced itself to his
attention. He might have been anything between thirty and sixty
years of age. There was youth in the smooth and nobly formed
forehead and in the clear, olive cheeks. There was youth, too,
and boundless vitality in the dark, flashing eyes, and in the
straight, shapely mouth.</p>

<p>But then, again, there was age in the powder of grey on either
temple, that seemed the finishing touch to his distinguished
head. But there was something more than age&mdash;something that
spoke of tremendous experience. His poise and self-assurance
could be guessed at rather than seen. His dark grey tweed coat
was perfect without the blunder of being too perfect. From the
sleek, black head to the polished shoes, there was no discordant
note. One hand held his hat, and the other, brown, but well cared
for, rested on his knee.</p>

<p>As Tydvil took in these details, it dawned on him that, though
the stranger might be an uninvited intruder, his whole appearance
and bearing bore testimony that he was one to be treated with
deference.</p>

<p>During the long minutes of Jones's survey, the stranger sat
motionless, almost as motionless as Jones did in his amazement.
At last, the head of Craddock, Burn, and Despard found his voice.
"I really beg your pardon," he said, "I had no idea there was
anyone in the room. I certainly did not hear you enter."</p>

<p>The dancing lights flickered for a moment in the stranger's
eyes. "And I, too, must ask your pardon for coming unannounced,
but, as it happened, I had no option."</p>

<p>"Oh! I understand; my secretary was not at her post?" queried
Tydvil.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, she was," came the answer, simply. "I did
not consult her because I felt sure she would refuse me
admission. I was obliged to take other steps."</p>

<p>There was a trace of annoyance in Tydvil Jones's face. He felt
that the reply was tinged with impertinence. His response was
rather stiff. "Then I have no doubt that since you took such
unusual steps to obtain an interview, your business is of some
importance."</p>

<p>The dark, finely arched eyebrows lifted slightly. "I am really
sorry if my action has caused you any annoyance, Mr.
Jones..."</p>

<p>"You have an advantage of me in knowing my name," interrupted
the other crisply.</p>

<p>His visitor waved a deprecating hand, but paused a moment
before answering. "I am afraid," he said, "that I shall have some
trouble in explaining myself. But as you so urgently and
expressly sent for Me, I trust, as I said before, that my coming
has not inconvenienced you."</p>

<p>"I sent for you!" There was no mistaking the genuine
astonishment in Tydvil's voice. "Why, my dear sir, I am perfectly
sure I have never seen you before."</p>

<p>The other nodded. "Quite so," he said. "Until now you have
only come into contact with my agents."</p>

<p>Jones mentally ran over in his mind the names of any of his
overseas business connections who might, by any chance, be
visiting Australia, but none occurred to him. "I am afraid I must
ask you to explain yourself more clearly," he said finally.</p>

<p>His visitor looked at him thoughtfully a moment before
replying. "As I said before, I am afraid I will have some little
trouble in making myself clear. I can perhaps best explain my
presence by asking you to recall to your memory a wish you
expressed aloud some five or ten minutes ago."</p>

<p>Tydvil reddened to the roots of his hair. Had the man been in
the room all that time? he wondered. And being there, had he the
audacity to refer to what he might have heard? For the moment
Jones had forgotten exactly what he had said, but he felt sure
the words were not such as he would care to have overheard. "I
have no distinct recollection of having said anything that might
interest you," he replied coldly. "As you apparently overheard my
words, there will be no need for me to repeat them."</p>

<p>The stranger received the rebuke unmoved. He passed his hand
to the inner pocket of his coat and produced a flat leather
wallet. He placed his hat and glove carefully on the table, and
drew from the wallet a card about six by four inches in size. To
Jones, it looked like a ledger index card. This he consulted
carefully for a moment, and then looked up. "The exact words you
used, Mr. Jones, were, 'If these be saints, may Satan himself
come and free me from them!' And, therefore," he continued, "I
feel myself justified in reiterating that I am here at your
express and urgent invitation."</p>

<p>Again Tydvil's face flushed from a mixture of shame and anger.
It was bad enough that his words had been overheard, but worse
still that this quiet and impressive stranger should see fit to
make a jest of them.</p>

<p>"Sir!" he insisted angrily, "you have apparently listened to
something that was not intended for other ears than my own. You
have seen fit to use those words against me in a spirit of ill-
timed levity and banter. I find your behaviour intolerable, sir,
and I must ask you to leave this room, instantly!" He emphasised
the last word so as to leave no room for argument.</p>

<p>Instead of being abashed or annoyed at the outbreak, the
visitor settled himself coolly back in his chair. With an elbow
on either arm, he joined the outspread tips of his fingers and
thumbs and regarded Jones above them with a smile twitching at
his lips.</p>

<p>"My friend," he said with gentle suavity, "you will find, as
many others have done before you, that it is far easier to call
me up than to dispose of me. I did not think it likely that you
would accept my claim to the personality, which, for the present,
we may define as 'Satan,' without hesitation. Still, on
reflection, you may not find it so preposterous after all."</p>

<p>Tydvil stared at the speaker, with not only wide open eyes,
but a slightly opened mouth. His feelings were a blend of anger
and curiosity. Of course, one could never tell, but insanity
takes such strange forms. The man did not look mad. But it might
be as well to humour him.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to affirm," he asked severely, "that you claim to
be the Prince of Evil in person?"</p>

<p>The other pursed his lips slightly and answered. "Well, I
cannot say I am altogether in love with the title, Mr. Jones, it
is not flattering, and of the two I almost prefer the word
'Satan,' but since you choose it, it may do as well as another. I
repeat that you see before you His Highness in person."</p>

<p>Jones moved very uneasily in his seat, then his eyes and hands
both sought the button on the table beside him. Before he could
press it, the other intervened, "That line of communication is
closed&mdash;temporarily." He spoke a little incisively.</p>

<p>Then Tydvil began to lose his temper. "Sir!" he said angrily,
"I am very busy and this absurd interview has already lasted too
long. I must again ask you to leave&mdash;instantly!"</p>

<p>Had he expected his amazing visitor to obey him at all, he
expected him to do so in a conventional manner, and through the
door. His method of leaving, however, left Tydvil staring blankly
at the empty armchair from which the stranger had vanished as he
spoke. He did not fade out; he just went out like the flame of a
candle, leaving no trace of his presence. Stay, though! There was
an expensive, new hat with a glove lying beside it on the corner
of the table to impress upon Jones the fact that the amazing
interview had not been the outcome of an overwrought nervous
system.</p>

<p>Tydvil half rose from his chair and stared around his room,
and then at the empty chair and very inexplicable hat and glove.
Then he said, slowly, and in an awed voice, "Well, I'll
be..."</p>

<p>"Softly! Softly! All in good time, my dear Mr. Jones! All in
good time!" came a mocking voice from the chair, and with the
words the stranger re-appeared as suddenly as he had vanished.
Apparently he had never moved from his place.</p>

<p>"The Duce!" exclaimed Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Precisely!" smiled the claimant to the title.</p>

<p>"You were there all the time?" demanded Jones, sinking back in
his chair.</p>

<p>"Exactly," the other replied. "Mere gallery play, you
know&mdash; but&mdash; nothing else would convince you that I had
at least some ground for my claim."</p>

<p>Jones pressed his hand to his head. "Am I losing my reason?"
he muttered.</p>

<p>"Not at all, my friend, not at all!" came the quick answer,
though the muttered words were scarcely audible. "You are
certainly undergoing a most unusual experience for these days.
None the less if you will listen to me for a few moments I think
I can convince you of my bona fides."</p>

<p>"You wish me to listen to you, assuming your claims to be
genuine?"</p>

<p>The other nodded. "Why not? Does not what you have just seen
convince you that I am no ordinary human being?"</p>

<p>Tydvil waved his hands helplessly. "Go on then! Go on!" he
said weakly.</p>

<p>"My dear sir," commenced the claimant to the throne of
darkness. "I do not blame you in the slightest for your
scepticism. I must admit that I have neglected your world very
much for the last few centuries, and it is but natural that you
should doubt my existence. You see, I recognise it is all my own
fault. My work has been going on so well without my personal
attention. However, here is the position." He settled himself
down more comfortably as he spoke.</p>

<p>Jones felt there was no comment he could make.</p>

<p>"It has lately been borne on me," continued the visitor
confidentially, "that I have become too conservative in my
business policies. My methods of administration of home affairs
are rather out of date. I feel I should move with the times."</p>

<p>"Of late years there has been a distressing and disturbing
intrusion of terrestrial politics into my kingdom. The new
element of Communism is now almost more numerous than the old
aristocracy of my kingdom. My gentlemen are rather proud and they
resent association with these Communists."</p>

<p>Jones nodded. There seemed nothing else to do.</p>

<p>"I warned Judas Iscariot," said the visitor reflectively,
"that he was making a mistake in inventing the Marx doctrines. He
thought he was causing something smart in the way of trouble. He
did not see the probable reaction on our politics as I did.
However, the fact remains and the situation has to be met. You
follow me so far?" he enquired.</p>

<p>Jones nodded again. He considered the man, or whatever his
visitor was, was doubtless in earnest. If he were insane, he was
an interesting bird. If, on the other hand, he were what he
claimed to be, then he was worthy of sympathy.</p>

<p>"Well," continued the stranger, "after turning the matter
over, I thought I could obtain a better grasp of the situation by
visiting the earth and looking into things for myself. There was
one difficulty, however."</p>

<p>"I should not have thought," put in Tydvil, "that you would
find any difficulty insuperable."</p>

<p>"Usually, no," he replied. "In this instance, however, I was
under a certain disability in that I am unable to make a visit
unless especially called upon by one of the inhabitants; and I
have been waiting a considerable time for the invitation. That
alone ought to convince me times have changed. A few centuries
ago there was always some churchman or scientist invoking my aid.
So, my dear Mr. Jones. I am indeed in your debt for your
assistance."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it was a quite unconscious service." In the
circumstances Tydvil was not anxious to assume the credit for his
visitor's presence. "Nevertheless, my obligation remains," said
the stranger civilly.</p>

<hr>

<a name="ch11"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p>Tydvil's head was whirling with bewilderment. Perhaps, the
thought occurred to him, both he and his visitor were non compos
mentis. However, if the strange creature were a product of a
prostrated nervous system it might be better to play up to him.
Especially as the next question was, "By the way, my friend, will
you tell me where on earth I am?"</p>

<p>"You are, at present," he replied, "in the city of Melbourne,
which is the capital of the State of Victoria in the Commonwealth
of Australia."</p>

<p>"Melbourne&mdash;Australia," murmured the other thoughtfully.
"Er really, Mr. Jones, you must forgive me, but I do not seem to
remember the names. Have you altered your European or Asiatic
nomenclature by any means?"</p>

<p>It was Tydvil's turn to stare. Strange to say, he felt a
little nettled that, if his visitor were what he professed to be,
he should be ignorant of Australia and, more particularly, of
Melbourne. Then he saw a light. "Perhaps," he suggested, "your
long absence from the world accounts for your difficulty. You
see, the continent has been known to Europeans for only about two
hundred years, and has been occupied for no more than one hundred
and fifty years. Still, it rather surprises me that you have not
heard of it."</p>

<p>"That would hardly account..." said His Highness thoughtfully.
"But&mdash; one moment! Is there a place called Sydney in
it!"</p>

<p>"That's right!" exclaimed Tydvil. "A place with a wonderful
harbour!"</p>

<p>"Now I recollect. They do talk about Sydney Harbour in Hell.
It is one of the minor punishments. Yes, we did have some people
from Sydney, but they caused so much trouble that the migration
department deported them and prohibited further imports. I
confused Australia with Austria for the moment. Ah, well! I am
sure your country will provide an interesting study."</p>

<p>He again consulted the card to which he had before referred.
It excited Tydvil's curiosity as a businessman. He summoned up
his courage. "Would I be in order," he asked, "if I enquired the
nature of that card you have twice consulted?'</p>

<p>"Most certainly, Mr. Jones, most certainly!" he responded
politely. "Indeed, as a businessman, I have no doubt you will
find it interesting. One of my recent innovations is a card
system for keeping State accounts. It is necessary for record
purposes to keep an account of all human actions. This is the
master card. An improvement of my own. On it, every record I
desire to examine appears immediately. It fades when I have
finished with it."</p>

<p>Tydvil sat erect. "You mean to say you have a record of the
lives of all living people?" he asked in amazement.</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly. Our records apply only to deeds which
should not have been committed. And, of course, to words and
thoughts also. They are kept to establish our claims when the
inevitable occasion arises."</p>

<p>"I suppose, then," said Tydvil hesitantly, "you have a card
for me in your system, then?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly, my friend." He had been holding the card in his
hand. Then he looked up, smiling pleasantly. "Just for the sake
of curiosity, we will see how our account stands."</p>

<p>He turned the master card over and ran his eyes down its
columns. Then a queer expression came over the lean intellectual
face. It combined astonishment with mystification. He stared at
the card, then at Jones, and again at the card. Then he shook it
tentatively, as one shakes a troublesome telephone. Finally he
sat up and stared at Tydvil. There was no mistaking the
astonishment of his expression.</p>

<p>"I hope," he faltered anxiously, "it is not so bad as your
looks indicate?" His Highness paused before speaking. "Whether
good or bad, Mr. Jones, depends on the viewpoint. I am not often
surprised at anything, but I must admit your record is almost
unique. I have seldom, in a long experience, seen anything
similar. My dear sir, what a very dull time you must have
had."</p>

<p>Tydvil's curiosity became insupportable. He looked at his
visitor appealingly. And then said anxiously, half holding out
his hand, "Might I?"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Jones, it is most unusual, and I scarcely care to
create a precedent. But the present circumstances are
exceptional. So we will stretch a point in this instance." And he
passed the card into the eager hand.</p>

<p>Tydvil's hand shook as he glanced at it. "Why!" he exclaimed,
looking up, "there is scarcely any thing on it."</p>

<p>"That, my dear sir, is the remarkable point. Most remarkable!
I assure you! Why, do you know that for a man of your age the
average number of entries would be from twenty to thirty
thousand? And of those, at least fifteen per cent would be red.
We put the more heinous entries in red so that they can be more
easily noted. You, as you will notice, have not a single red
debit against you but the last&mdash;the one that is responsible
for my being here."</p>

<p>Tydvil was reading his card with concentrated interest.
Suddenly he half stood up and ejaculated, "Oh! I say, this is not
fair! I didn't, I'll swear I didn't!" His face reddened
perceptibly.</p>

<p>"Surely you are mistaken. I assure you, Mr. Jones, our book-
keeping system is infallible."</p>

<p>Jones handed back the card, and pointed to it with a finger
that shook. "That entry, dated August 7. The one in the pale blue
ink."</p>

<p>His Highness took the card and glanced at the entry. Then he
shook a playful finger at Tydvil. "Come, come, my friend! The
girl in pink with the dark eyes, on the Sydney railway platform!
That is correct!"</p>

<p>"But I can't admit it," retorted Jones, a good deal
nettled.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," came the suave reply. "Your memory must be
betraying you. You did not take delivery, certainly, but that
does not cancel your obligation."</p>

<p>"Still," protested the delinquent, "there should be some
allowance for a mere passing thought."</p>

<p>His Highness shook his head. "Impossible, my friend! Quite
impossible! Still, it is only a trifle. These blue ink records
are merely formal."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" exclaimed Tydvil, struck by a bright idea. "Would
it be possible to see my wife's account?"</p>

<p>Mirth and gravity fought in the dark eyes, and mirth won. He
laughed heartily and replied, "Oh, my friend! Consider a moment!
What is your colloquial expression? Be a sport, eh? That would be
hardly playing the game. As a matter of business, I ought to let
you see it, but still..." He waved the thought away with his
hand.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," replied Tydvil. "I am sure Amy would
have no nice feelings about inspecting mine."</p>

<p>"Doubtless! What woman would hesitate if she had a chance of
examining an accurate and impartial statement of her husband's
little lapses?"</p>

<p>Jones chuckled at the idea. Much to his own surprise, he found
himself accepting his visitor at his face value, and was also
actually enjoying the unconventional interview. "If such a thing
were possible, ennui would vanish from the world."</p>

<p>"And so would the human race," laughed His Highness. "No, it
would not do at all."</p>

<p>Then he sat up and spoke seriously. "However, this is not
business, is it? And I am afraid I am taking up a good deal of
your valuable time. Now, what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>The abrupt question sobered Jones immediately. The idea that
his visitor could be of any assistance to him had never entered
his mind. Now the idea was implanted there, the thought of
accepting anything from such a quarter shocked him. Doubtless his
look betrayed the thought.</p>

<p>"Of course, Mr. Jones," said His Highness earnestly, "there is
no compulsion on you to accept the specific service you mentioned
when you asked for this interview. I would he very sorry to hold
you to the letter of your word. Any man in your position may
easily be excused for what he might say in a moment of
irritation. Still, my obligation is very great, and I would like
to show my gratitude."</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the sincerity of the words. The saying
that his visitor was not so black as he was painted, flashed
across Tydvil's mind. The other, watching, answered the unspoken
thought. "There is a good deal of truth in that old saying," he
said. "I suppose no one has been more maligned than I with less
chance of defending himself. I am grateful even for that small
concession."</p>

<p>As he spoke he drew a handsome cigarette case from his pocket.
"Do you mind if I smoke?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," answered Jones politely.</p>

<p>His Highness held out the open case. "You will join me?" he
said pleasantly.</p>

<p>Jones shook his head. "Thank you, but I never smoke."</p>

<p>The other smiled quizzically. "Ah, my friend! You would be far
better able to bear your troubles if you did. Self-denial comes
to a point where it becomes self-righteousness&mdash;an
unpleasant characteristic. Let me press you!" He again held out
the case.</p>

<p>Jones looked at it indecisively. "I have often thought of
beginning, but my wife detests the habit." His Highness raised
his eyebrows in gentle mockery. "And," went on Jones, "it might
make me sick."</p>

<p>The other laughed lightly. "Not one of these. Among other
virtues, they have the quality of converting anyone who uses them
into an habitual smoker, whom no tobacco, however strong, can
upset."</p>

<p>Tydvil hesitated no longer, and placed one of the white
cylinders between his lips. His Highness followed suit and, to
Tydvil's astonishment, the moment it touched his lips it became
alight. Then he bent forward, offering the glowing tip to his
host.</p>

<p>Jones had no objection to tobacco, indeed, he really liked the
aroma. Only the fear of Amy had kept him from indulging earlier.
Now, as he drew the first fumes into his mouth, a delicious sense
of contentment came over him.</p>

<p>"Well?" queried his guest through the blue smoke.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" quoth Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Good!" smiled His Highness. "And now we can resume our talk.
I really hope that you are not going to refuse my offer," he went
on persuasively.</p>

<p>"Well," said Tydvil reflectively; the first hesitation had
vanished with the first cloud of smoke. "I really don't see what
there is that you can do for me."</p>

<p>"There is very little I cannot do for you," came the suave
answer. "One hesitates to say such a thing, but really, Mr.
Jones, you have made singularly little use of your great
opportunities. You have lived and so has a jellyfish. I'm afraid
the analogy sounds rude, and I can readily excuse you for taking
exception to it, but you must admit its justice."</p>

<p>"I admit I find life rather dull," conceded Tydvil a little
ruefully. "Perhaps I would be more content with a little
enjoyment." He stared at the smoke spirals from his cigarette
without looking up.</p>

<p>"Well, it is all at your command. What would you have.
Wealth?"</p>

<p>"I already have that."</p>

<p>"Health?"</p>

<p>"I am as sound as a bell and tough as hickory."</p>

<p>"Power?"</p>

<p>"I have sufficient."</p>

<p>"Ambition?"</p>

<p>"I have none that I have not already satisfied."</p>

<p>"Love of women?"</p>

<p>Jones looked up sharply. "I have had one experience in that
direction," he said dryly, "and I am not hankering for any more,
thank you."</p>

<p>"Oh! I mean the genuine kind," laughed His Highness. "Once
bitten..." quoted Jones sourly. "I wouldn't take the risk."</p>

<p>"Pessimist!" chuckled the other.</p>

<p>"Maybe," came the short answer. "But if you had lived with Amy
for ten years I know which of our residences you would
prefer."</p>

<p>"What about the lighter side of life?" asked His Highness.
"The joy of living."</p>

<p>Tydvil knitted his brows. "Yes," he said slowly. "I admit that
appeals to me. But look how I am tied up. I am an example. A
pious pattern. A guiding light. How could I break away from the
family tradition? Sheer hypocrisy, I suppose! I am so used to
being looked up to that it takes an effort to come down from my
pedestal. I cannot have the fun in someone else's name.' He
sighed a little in self pity.</p>

<p>"Quite possible, my friend," came the prompt answer. "Eh!"
Jones looked up, startled.</p>

<p>"It would be easily possible for you to assume another
identity for your enterprise," said His Highness, smiling.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say..." The question stuck in Tydvil's
throat.</p>

<p>"Exactly! But it rather complicates matters. You see, so long
as the service you ask is an every day matter, I would give it
gladly and without condition. The other would be subject to some
restrictions which, I regret, are unavoidable."</p>

<p>"If you could guarantee individuality for my amusements, I
don't think you would find me haggling over the terms," said
Tydvil decisively.</p>

<p>"Of course," said His Highness, "it would be a mere formality.
Allow me to give you another cigarette. A mere formality! I
should have to ask you to give me a promissory note&mdash;for any
term. The consideration being," he fixed his luminous eyes on
Jones, "that you assume any individuality you desire, and call
upon me for any service you desire, during the currency of the
note. The note to be void if I fail in my service. I think that
is generous enough."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," conceded Tydvil. "But," he went on hesitating,
"what amount will be involved? I am willing to pay anything in
reason."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't let us talk of money between friends!" said the
other hastily. "We must put something in, of course. Say, for
example&mdash;no! Let us go back to the old tradition&mdash;your
soul it means nothing and makes the thing legal."</p>

<p>Tydvil looked at his visitor intently, and his gaze was met by
another of disarming frankness. "Signed in blood and all that
sort of thing?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Bosh! Ink is quite good enough," came the answer. "But,"
temporarised Jones, "would such an instrument be binding?"</p>

<p>"As doyen of the legal profession, my dear Mr. Jones, you may
accept my assurance that it would be," answered His Highness
easily.</p>

<p>"I didn't think the law would admit there would be property in
a soul," said Tydvil thoughtfully.</p>

<p>The other blew a long, fine stream of smoke from his pursed
lips. "I think," he said significantly, "that I could very easily
convert anyone who adopted that view. However," he laughed
slightly, and went on airily, "it is a mere formality and means
nothing."</p>

<p>Jones sat thinking deeply. The idea was alluring. It gave him
a chance to break from his rigid environment. Still he hesitated.
Could this being be what he professed to be? There was still
doubt in his mind. He looked up at his visitor, who was watching
him intently.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jones," he said, "I can easily excuse your doubts in the
circumstances, and am willing to submit to a test, anything you
choose, before pressing you to take my offer."</p>

<p>Jones looked around the room. His eye lighted on the three-ton
door of the strong-room. He alone held its keys. He turned to his
friend. "Would it be possible for you to open that door without
moving from your seat?"</p>

<p>His Highness nodded. "I will do more than you
ask&mdash;watch!" As he spoke, the great door swung slowly and
noiselessly out on its hinges. As its broad edge turned towards
him, Jones gave a little cry of astonishment. He saw that, though
it had opened, its twelve wrist-thick bolts remained shot. They
must have been torn through the frame, but the frame remained
intact.</p>

<p>"Je-ru-salem!" whistled Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Wait&mdash;I promised you something more."</p>

<p>As Jones looked back, something fluttered through the air and
landed on the blotting pad before him. He gasped as he saw it was
his private cheque book. That book, he knew, was locked in a
smaller safe in the strong-room.</p>

<p>Jones looked an enquiry at His Highness, who nodded assent.
Then he walked over to the open door and examined the bolts.
Entering the strong-room, he unlocked the smaller safe. His
cheque book was not there. Convinced, he returned to his chair.
At a wave of the thin brown hand, the door closed as quietly as
it had opened.</p>

<p>"You forgot to put away the cheque book," laughed Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Pardon," murmured His Highness. Leaning forward, he picked up
the book and tossed it towards the steel door. It disappeared in
mid flight. Jones stood up and opened the door with his keys and
the combination. In the strong-room he found his cheque book back
in its place.</p>

<p>Returning to his chair once more, he sat with his hands on the
edge of his table, staring blankly at the blotting pad for a long
minute. Then he came to swift decision. "I'll do it!" he said
abruptly.</p>

<p>His visitor nodded, smiling. "I am really delighted to hear
it. I assure you I take a great personal interest in you, Mr.
Jones, and I feel certain you will have no cause to regret your
determination. Now, let us arrange the formalities, and I will be
in a position to take your instructions. Have you a promissory
note form?"</p>

<p>With the air of a man who has burned his boats and enjoyed the
process, Jones opened a small cash-box, from which he drew a
small wad of stamped forms. Bending to select one, he hesitated.
"By the way," he asked, "what stamps will be necessary?"</p>

<p>His Highness shook his head. "I scarcely follow you. Is a
stamp necessary?"</p>

<p>"Decidedly! Under the Act," explained Tydvil, "it is necessary
to have a duty stamp valued at sixpence on each note up to
twenty-five pounds in value, one shilling up to fifty pounds, and
an additional shilling for each further fifty pounds, or part of
that amount. I would prefer to have the note unassailably
legal."</p>

<p>The other waved his hand largely. "Why go to unnecessary
expense&mdash;make it a sixpenny stamp, my dear fellow." Then,
observing the flush on the face of Tydvil, he continued,
"However, decide for yourself. I am afraid I was looking at it
from my viewpoint rather than yours."</p>

<p>Jones still hesitated.</p>

<p>"You see, my friend, I am apt to regard a commodity as of low
value when I can obtain millions of it for nothing&mdash;the
world market parity for souls. Still, I see your point of view.
Decide for yourself, my dear sir."</p>

<p>Jones chuckled. "I see, a purely commercial proposition, at
ruling prices. It is not what I value it at, but what it would
bring?"</p>

<p>"Precisely," answered his visitor cheerfully.</p>

<p>Tydvil drew a form with a sixpenny stamp on it from the wad,
and laughed. "Here goes!" Preparing to write, he said, "Now, this
is the first day of August&mdash;shall we say at three
months?"</p>

<p>The other bowed. "I leave the details entirely in your hands,
and with complete confidence." A very handsome testimonial coming
from such a quarter.</p>

<p>Tydvil blushed with pride. "Very well! Three months, then.
That will make it due on November fourth, allowing for the formal
three days' grace." He wrote for a moment, and then looked up
with a puzzled expression. "To whom shall I make it payable, you
see..." he paused awkwardly.</p>

<p>His Highness smiled. "Of course, it would be
hardly&mdash;well, a little unusual to make it payable to the
Devil."</p>

<p>Jones nodded. "My idea exactly. And since we are likely to see
a good deal of one another during the next three months, it might
be as well to arrange for some conventional form of address at
the same time."</p>

<p>His visitor reflected a moment. "There are so many
names&mdash; Satan, The Devil, Lucifer, Ahrimanes, The Tempter,
Prince of Darkness, of Evil&mdash; all very uncomplimentary, and
even more inaccurate, and quite unsuitable for modern use, at any
rate. Can you suggest anything yourself?"</p>

<p>Tydvil tried, but not hopefully. "The Dickens," he paused and,
receiving no answer, went on, "Old Scratch, Old Nick..."</p>

<p>"All most offensive and familiar," retorted His Highness,
somewhat nettled.</p>

<p>"Might I venture to suggest," Tydvil returned, "that we could
use the last name I mentioned by paraphrasing it. We could change
'Old Nick' to Nicholas Senior. I think Mr. Nicholas Senior would
be most suitable."</p>

<p>"Excellent, my friend, excellent!" agreed His Highness. "We
will certainly make it Nicholas Senior."</p>

<p>"How about a title," put in Jones, persuasively. "Say, Sir
Nicholas Senior, K.B.E."</p>

<p>"No," replied his friend. "On the whole I prefer to remain
completely incog. Put it down to a natural humility."</p>

<p>Jones apologised. He felt there was a rebuke behind the words.
Presently he paused again in his writing.</p>

<p>"Provided, when the note falls due, you have fulfilled your
side of the contract, do you take immediate possession of the
security?" he asked a little uneasily.</p>

<p>"Not at all! Not at all!" answered Mr. Senior hastily. "The
usual terms apply in full. You retain a life interest in your
soul, which I inherit on your death&mdash;that is, when you have
no further use for it."</p>

<p>"Very generous," said Tydvil, looking relieved. Presently he
looked up, and read from the form before him. "Dated August 1st,
1904. Due, November 4th, 1904. In place of the usual sum in
figures I have written 'Soul.' Will that suffice?"</p>

<p>Mr. Senior nodded agreement.</p>

<p>"Three months after date," continued Jones, "I promise to pay
Nicholas Senior, or order, my Immortal Soul for services to be
rendered during the currency of this note. Payable at my offices
in 3973 Flinders Lane, Melbourne. Signed, Tydvil Jones."</p>

<p>He handed the note across the table to Mr. Senior, who read it
carefully. Then he turned the note face down, and, after writing
on the back of it, he returned it to Jones for inspection.</p>

<p>This is the endorsement Jones read. The handwriting was
exquisitely neat and clear. "If, during the currency of this
note, I fail to perform any task or service of any description
which I may be called upon to perform by the maker thereof, I
agree that the note shall become automatically null and void.
Nicholas R., et I."</p>

<p>"Very handsome, indeed, Mr. Senior," said Jones, handing back
the note, "but I assure you, quite unnecessary."</p>

<p>Mr. Senior folded the document carefully, and placed it in his
wallet. "We are both businessmen, my friend, and it is only right
that my obligation should be set out in writing."</p>

<p>Jones stared at him a moment thoughtfully. "I suppose it is
entirely legal. Not that I would think of trying to upset
it."</p>

<p>There was a grim smile at the corners of the clean-cut mouth.
"Not all the children of my very numerous family known as the
Legal Profession, together, could upset it."</p>

<p>"It would be interesting to hear it argued," smiled
Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," from the still smiling lips. "But, as from the
County Courts to the Privy Council I am represented on every
bench...!" He flipped his fingers carelessly.</p>

<p>Then his mood changed. "And now, my friend, I am entirely at
your service. Command me."</p>

<p>"I must think things over a little," replied Tydvil. "You see,
this has come so suddenly and unexpectedly..." He was interrupted
by the telephone bell.</p>

<p>"Excuse me one moment." He raised the receiver to his ear and
listened a moment. Then he snorted out a curt "Very well!" and
slammed it down again.</p>

<p>Then he turned abruptly to Mr. Senior. "My wife will be here
in half an hour. I have no desire to meet her just now. Could you
arrange some means of altering her intention?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly. A pleasure indeed," replied Mr. Senior
lightly. "I will be most interested to meet the lady, who, I feel
sure, is responsible for your own remarkable record&mdash;to a
great extent. But after?"</p>

<p>Jones thought for a moment. "Can you meet me here about seven-
thirty this evening?"</p>

<p>In answer to a nod of acquiescence, he went on, "That will
suit me admirably, so, until then, I need not trouble you." He
rose and looked at the door. "If I let you out by the door, it
may cause comment. Miss Brand is not aware of your presence
here."</p>

<p>"No matter," said Mr. Senior, "my goings and comings may be
arranged otherwise."</p>

<p>"There will be no trouble about my wife?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest! I will arrange to have her fully occupied
for the remainder of the day." He held out his hand, which Tydvil
shook warmly, and as he released it, Mr. Senior was not. He
vanished.</p>

<p>For a long time Tydvil sat thinking. Then he took his hat, and
leaving the warehouse, he turned into Elizabeth Street, there
made certain purchases, and returned to his office.</p>

<a name="ch12"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p>While Tydvil Jones was undergoing the experiences of the most
unsettling morning of his life, Amy was as busy as a nest of
hornets planning reprisals. For the first time during their
married life, Tydvil had out-fought her. His revolt wounded her
pride. She was too clever not to recognise that a few more
victories such as that of the morning&mdash;that Battle of
Breakfast would shake her domestic throne.</p>

<p>How very tiresome men were, thought Amy. But Tydvil's
tiresomeness had to be stopped. After careful reflection on the
situation, she decided that a fight to a finish in his own
office, where he could not afford to make a scene, would be all
to her advantage. It was this decision that impelled her to ring
Tydvil to notify him of her intended call. She decided against
descending on him unannounced. She had backed her challenge with
the warning, that if he were absent when she arrived, she would
wait for him in his office all day if necessary.</p>

<p>Her car was already waiting at the door when a mighty
limousine Rolls Royce swung from St. Kilda Road into the drive.
With all the majesty of a battleship, it came to anchor just
astern of her own car as Amy was in the act of stepping in to
it.</p>

<p>Amy stepped back under the colonnaded verandah. The chauffeur
of the shining monster sprang from his seat and swung open its
door almost reverently, and from the door stepped a stranger.</p>

<p>The car had impressed Amy. A limousine of that make meant no
ordinary mortal, and Amy did not care much for ordinary mortals,
except as objects of patronage. But the stranger, as he
approached her, impressed her more than the car. There was a
distinction in his bearing that was worthy of the entwined red
R's on the radiator.</p>

<p>He mounted the steps and stood bareheaded before her. "May I
enquire," he asked deferentially, "if I am speaking to Mrs.
Tydvil Jones?" and there was a delicate flattery in the
deference.</p>

<p>She bowed graciously.</p>

<p>He looked a little embarrassed. "I am afraid," he said,
glancing at the waiting car, "that I have chosen an awkward
moment for my call. Perhaps you will permit me to return at a
more suitable time."</p>

<p>Amy wreathed her face in her best samples of "Dear Amy"
smiles. Her mission, she assured him, was of little or no
importance. Would he kindly come inside. As they entered the
reception room she turned to him. Her curiosity almost was
visible as it oozed from her.</p>

<p>He drew a gold case from his vest pocket. "My name," he said,
as he handed her the card, "is Nicholas Senior, though it is
probably quite unfamiliar to you, if I may venture to say so, it
is not altogether unknown in England."</p>

<p>Amy felt she ought to know the name of one so distinguished in
appearance. She felt almost guilty that it conveyed nothing to
her mind. She shook her head. "I must confess that I have not
heard it." She smiled graciously to reassure him that her
ignorance was no reflection on him.</p>

<p>"I have come to Australia," explained Mr. Senior, "with the
object of studying your social problems. I desire to compare them
with those of Britain and the United States."</p>

<p>Amy brightened. "Are you representing any particular society
or interested in any special branch?" she enquired with rising
interest.</p>

<p>Her visitor shook his head. "I am entirely a free-lance, but I
was informed both in England and America that Mrs. Tydvil Jones
of Melbourne was pre-eminently competent to act as my mentor and
guide. It is to that you owe, what I am afraid is, a somewhat
untimely call."</p>

<p>Warm and glowing satisfaction pervaded Amy's entire system. "I
did not know," she replied with smiling modesty, "that my poor
little efforts were known outside the circle of my immediate
associates&mdash;an enthusiastic group, Mr. Senior."</p>

<p>"Ah! Dear lady," he responded gently, "you do yourself far
less than justice. Believe me, the name of Mrs. Tydvil Jones
stands high, among those who know, on the list of the world's
philanthropists." The ring of sincerity in his voice was
faultless.</p>

<p>The words were as oil on the troubled spirit of Amy. What
ammunition to use on Tydvil! "Still," she protested, "I cannot
think of anyone in England who knew of my work."</p>

<p>He smiled. "When I decided to come to Australia, I had the
honour and privilege of lunching with the Archbishop of
Canterbury. I discussed with him the object of my visit, and it
was from him I first learned your name. It appears that a former
Archbishop of Melbourne had given him a most glowing account of
your work; and"&mdash;here he felt in his pocket &mdash;"His
Grace was kind enough to procure this letter for me." He handed
her a dignified looking missive.</p>

<p>Amy took it and glanced at the address and the mitred flap. "I
am delighted you have called, Mr. Senior, and you can trust me to
assist you in every way I can."</p>

<p>"I felt sure of that." He bowed his gratitude. "Indeed, the
Archbishop informed me that in making your acquaintance, I would
be opening every avenue of social effort I wished to explore. It
is for that reason I have taken the earliest opportunity to
call."</p>

<p>Never before in her life had Amy felt so important or so
perfectly satisfied with herself. She would let Master Tydvil
know exactly where she stood. It did not occur to her to doubt
for a moment that the Archbishop of Canterbury was alive to her
good deeds. Although she did not belong to the Anglican church,
her acquaintance with the clergy was like Sam Weller's knowledge
of London, "Extensive and peculiar."</p>

<p>She assured Mr. Senior that she had nothing to do that might
not be deferred, and readily placed herself at his disposal.</p>

<p>It was then that her fascinating visitor suggested the plan of
her lunching with him, that they might devote the afternoon to
the inspection of her endeavours. He apologised nicely to her for
inviting her to Menzies, where he was staying. He expressed his
own distaste at patronising an hotel, but regretted that he could
not elsewhere obtain accommodation suitable for his needs.</p>

<p>Mr. Senior assured Amy that he was an ardent advocate for
prohibition, and hoped that before he left Melbourne, his voice
would be raised on that subject from some public platform.</p>

<p>Amy hesitated. Never in her life had she set foot in an hotel.
Never did she think it possible she would be guilty of such an
action. Then she remembered the Rolls Royce. It occurred to her
that if a man who had lunched with the Archbishop of Canterbury,
and who was a prohibitionist, did not think it wrong to stay at
an hotel, surely it would not be wrong for Amy Jones to lunch
there with him.</p>

<p>So, in the end, she dismissed her own car and stepped into
that of Mr. Senior, as proud a woman as ever accompanied that
gentleman anywhere&mdash; and there had been very, very many
before her.</p>

<hr>

<a name="ch13"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, in his office, Tydvil Jones had fanned his own
plans. A touch on his bell called Miss Brand to the presence. "If
Mr. Brewer is about the office, will you kindly let him know I
require to see him," was the message he delivered to his
secretary.</p>

<p>Geraldine looked at him uncertainly. He read her unspoken
uneasiness. "It is another matter, Miss Brand. I will respect
your wishes about this morning's affair."</p>

<p>Re-assured, Geraldine returned to her desk and sought Billy on
the warehouse extension lines. She delivered her message with a
wicked little smile, hanging up immediately to prevent the
enquiry he would be sure to make.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the culprit answered the summons. She
heard his approach, but kept her eyes resolutely on her work. She
knew he paused for a moment beside her, and anathematised her
heart for its rebellious response to his nearness. She heard him
enter the room behind her, and her work suffered because she
could not keep her thoughts from what was going on behind the
closed door.</p>

<p>All the morning Billy had been awaiting the summons. He
anticipated, and regretted, the prospect of a summary dismissal.
His only regret for his conduct lay in the thought that his folly
had made the task of winning Geraldine trebly difficult. Being
sacked was a comparatively small price to pay for the glory of
holding her in his arms. He had paused for a second to gratify
his eyes with a glimpse of that golden helmet&mdash;or was it
copper? Then he marched grimly to what he believed was his
official scaffold.</p>

<p>Tydvil Jones waved him to a chair with a smileless face. The
face was a sign of ill-omen that was balanced by his offer of the
chair. Execution, he thought, would be carried out standing.
Billy felt he cut a very poor spectacle. Since the morning the
rich colouring of his left eye had had time to develop. Its
swollen lid drooped until it almost shut out the light. No man
could feel dignified with such an eye, especially in the presence
of one who had seen how he attained to it.</p>

<p>He began to speak, but Tydvil, recognising his intention, cut
him short. "Do not wish to refer to that matter, Brewer, if you
please! Miss Brand has, very magnanimously, I think, interceded
on your behalf." Billy's heart gave a jump.</p>

<p>Then, with a very meaning look at the polychrome eye, he went
on. "We will regard the incident as also closed."</p>

<p>"That's a nasty one," thought Billy. But the fact that
Geraldine had interceded took the sting from Tyddie's irony. If
she had turned aside the wrath of justice she might...</p>

<p>Here Tydvil cut into his golden hopes. "I understand, Brewer,
that you are addicted to gambling in fact that you are in the
habit of playing a card game known as draw poker."</p>

<p>Billy gasped from the jolt. "Who," he wondered, "was the kind
friend who had handed that item of news to Tyddie?" Truly, it was
his day of atonement. It seemed as though the bill for the total
of his peccadilloes was being presented at once. "Let 'em all
come," he murmured to himself hopelessly.</p>

<p>He admitted the charge, and added, "At the same time, I have
never regarded it as a heinous offence."</p>

<p>His judge pursed his lips. "Perhaps not, Brewer&mdash;that is,
compared with some others I know of, but on which I will not
dwell." The voice was as dry as a summer's throat. "However, I
did not send for you to censure you, however much I disapprove of
certain of your actions. I wished to know if you would be good
enough to teach, me that game?"</p>

<p>Billy thought his ears had been bewitched. Tyddie asking to be
taught how to play "draw!"</p>

<p>"He'll be taking me out for a snifter yet," reflected the
senior city representative of C. B. &amp; .D. His expression
revealed his amazement to Tydvil more completely than words
could.</p>

<p>"I can understand your astonishment," said Mr. Jones, "but the
fact (Oh! Tydvil!) is, I am making a study of the gambling evil.
I find I am handicapped in my investigations by a need of a
practical knowledge of the subject. I am, therefore, looking to
you for enlightenment."</p>

<p>Billy breathed deeply. Two reprieves in ten minutes were
rather too much for him, but he pulled himself together. Billy
never questioned for a moment that Tydvil's statement was
anything but the truth. It proved again that a reputation for a
blameless life is a perfect cloak for a lapse therefrom. Billy
hastened to assert his willingness to oblige, but suggested the
necessity for a pack of cards.</p>

<p>Tydvil nodded. "That has not escaped me," he replied. Opening
a drawer in his table, he handed his recent purchase across to
Billy. "I presume those will do."</p>

<p>Billy snapped the twine and, opening the box, slid the cards
on to the table and ran his fingers through them with an expert's
touch. "Of course, you understand that we must play for some form
of stakes?" he queried.</p>

<p>"I presumed that it would be so," Tydvil acquiesced sourly,
"but I suggest we play for something of no value&mdash;pins, for
instance."</p>

<p>Billy smiled. "They will do for a start, anyhow," he replied
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"My interest is, of course, purely academic," insisted Mr.
Jones.</p>

<p>"Quite so," admitted Billy as with deft fingers he shuffled
cards so easily as to draw an admiring comment on his dexterity.
"Merely a matter of practice," Billy said as he dealt each five
cards, cleanly and swiftly.</p>

<p>Then, facing them up, he gave Tydvil his first lesson in the
gentle and unhallowed art of "draw." It is a game in which the
elements are easily grasped. In spite of its simplicity, however,
there is no game demands a more skilled technique. Nature had
richly endowed Billy Brewer with that brazen sang froid which is
a poker player's best asset.</p>

<p>Billy dealt half a dozen hands face up, and explained the
mysteries of pairs, threes, straights, flushes and fulls, and the
chances of improving on the draw. Then, after dividing the
contents of Tydvil's pin tray between them, he began a practical
demonstration. Tydvil quickly grasped the essentials, and, before
they realised it, the two were deep in the simple pastime. Single
handed "draw" for pins did not appeal to Billy very strongly, but
to Tydvil, it opened up a new and fascinating avenue of
amusement.</p>

<p>In less than half an hour, beginners' luck and the absence of
risk enabled Tydvil to completely relieve Billy of his stock of
pins.</p>

<p>Noting the smile of satisfaction on Jones's face, Billy
suggested that, had the pins represented cash, his opponent would
not have been quite so venturesome.</p>

<p>The imputation touched Tydvil's pride in his new found
knowledge. It pricked him into replying. "Well, I would be
prepared, for once, to prove my competence to play for
money&mdash;a small amount, say?"</p>

<p>It occurred to Billy, that since his employer was paying him
for his time, and would probably pay more for his daring, the
arrangement would be most satisfactory.</p>

<p>"Good," he challenged, "we'll make the pins worth threepence a
dozen." So, with pins to the value of half a crown each, they
recommenced.</p>

<p>For an hour nothing disturbed the silence of the sanctum but
the murmur of the two voices. Outside, Miss Brand, denied
admittance to caller after caller, including two departmental
heads. These, hearing that Tyddie had been in conference with
Brewer half the morning, earnestly discussed what campaign the
Chief could be organising. Lunch time came, but there was no
sound of movement behind the frosted-glass door.</p>

<p>Inside, Tydvil was backing amazing luck with improving
technique. Again and again he sent Billy to the pin tray for more
ammunition. Determination to come out victor led Brewer into
taking risks that he could not afford with the astute Tydvil.
Finally, after throwing in his hand rather than risk "seeing" the
victorious Tydvil, he leaned back and said, "I have no right to
ask, but what did you hold then? I drew a flush."</p>

<p>There was a little smile on Tydvil's face as he confessed to a
pair of threes.</p>

<p>Billy put the cards down. He looked at the pile of pins in
front of Tydvil, and said, "Your education is complete. A man who
looks like a full hand holding a pair of threes needs no further
instruction. I'll cut my loss." He dug his hand into his trouser
pocket.</p>

<p>For the first time during the session, Tydvil looked at the
clock. "Good gracious, Brewer!" he exclaimed. "It is half past
one o'clock! Dear me! I'm sure I had no idea of the time." Then,
glancing at the silver, he said, "I couldn't think of letting you
pay, Brewer. I am much obliged for the trouble you have
taken."</p>

<p>Billy shook his head. "Had I won I would have expected to be
paid," he said decisively. "I consider myself very lucky it was
only three pence a dozen."</p>

<p>"It is a most demoralising game. Most demoralising!" said
Tydvil gravely. "I admit that I became most fascinated with its
possibilities. Nothing could have brought home to me more clearly
how the evil of gambling could take hold of one. I would rather
we considered the matter settled."</p>

<p>Leaning across the table, Brewer drew the pad with its pile of
pins towards him. Swiftly his deft fingers separated the pile
into dozens. Presently, Billy looked up. "I make it thirty seven
dozen and four. Threepence a dozen lets me down lightly. I owe
you nine and fourpence." He sorted out four florins, a shilling
and threepence. Adding a penny from his vest pocket, he handed
the loot to Tydvil, who accepted it reluctantly.</p>

<p>"At any rate," he said, "in future I shall be able to speak of
gambling with some experience."</p>

<p>Billy stood up. "I think it lucky for the community that you
will make nothing but academic use of your knowledge. I should
hate to sit in with you in a game of half-crown rises. You have
been too good a pupil." He grinned.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid my friends would be terribly shocked if they knew
how I have spent the last two hours," Jones said.</p>

<p>"Well," said Billy from the door, "they are not likely to hear
it from me. Would one of them believe you had won nine shillings
and fourpence from me in your own office?"</p>

<p>As he passed Geraldine's table he looked towards her. His one
eye met her two fixed on him in real consternation at the havoc
she had wrought. In spite of herself, a dismayed "Oh!" broke from
her lips.</p>

<p>Billy, the unregenerate, smiled cheerfully. "It was coming to
me, Geraldine&mdash;and it was well worth the getting. Isn't it a
beauty?"</p>

<p>His utter impenitence froze her sympathy. "In future," she
said with crushing dignity, "I do not wish you to speak to
me."</p>

<p>With his head on one side Billy surveyed her with a twinkle in
the undamaged eye. "I hear and obey, O Queen! But there's no law
agin' lookin' at ye, Geraldine, me darlint." He kissed the tips
of his fingers to her and went on his way.</p>

<p>As she watched him go the uncertain little smile on her lips
grew to a little laugh as he disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>In his room Tydvil gazed at the coins in his hand with a
certain amount of pride. Taking his hat he apologised politely to
Geraldine for having detained her. He passed the restaurant where
he was in the habit of spending a midday two shillings. Turning
into Collins Street, he entered one over the threshold of which
he had never yet set foot. Here he ordered a lunch that, when he
had given the waiter two shillings, left him with fourpence of
his winnings. Tydvil Jones felt much better for his lunch.</p>

<hr>

<a name="ch14"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p>It would have astonished Tydvil Jones considerably had he
known that his wife, also, had departed from the rules of her
rigorous upbringing. With fluttering excitement at what she
considered a far more heinous lapse than that of the curate who
finished a day out by returning home in a smoking carriage, Amy
had accompanied her new and distinguished acquaintance to
Menzies.</p>

<p>During the time they, waited in the lounge, and afterwards in
the great dining-room, with its gaily plumaged women and their
squires, it gave her a thrill of feline satisfaction to observe
the admiring eyes that followed her escort.</p>

<p>But there was one thorn in her bouquet of roses. For the first
time in her life, she was conscious that her Spartan simplicity
of dress made her feel there was no other word for
it&mdash;dowdy. Yesterday she thought it would have given her a
sense of pride. Today, well! There was that woman's hat, for
instance, that somehow seemed to lend a vividness to a not very
attractive face. Amy felt that if she wore such a hat it would
take on an extra importance. "After all, why not make the best of
one's looks," she reflected. "Perhaps Tydvil was right, after
all."</p>

<p>Apart from that she felt perfectly happy. Mr. Senior proved a
fascinating companion. He was both witty and understanding, and
won her confidence completely. Indeed, she found herself thinking
how pleasant it would be if Tydvil possessed such graceful self-
assurance combined with Mr. Senior's undoubted intellectual
attainments.</p>

<p>Tydvil never listened to Amy with such courteous and genuine
interest, or deferred so respectfully to her opinions. A far less
conceited woman than Amy would have found Mr. Senior's attention
very flattering.</p>

<p>They exchanged low voiced censure on two women at a
neighbouring table who drank hock with their luncheon. Mr. Senior
gently deplored the state of a society in which such a spectacle
could be tolerated.</p>

<p>Amy assured him that not only she, but her husband, shared
similar views, and she hoped that she could arrange an early
meeting between the two men. "You have so much in common in your
principles," asserted Amy, that she was sure they would get on
well together.</p>

<p>Mr. Senior, who was sipping mineral water, expressed a fervent
hope that a meeting with Mr. Jones would not be long delayed. He
also looked forward to the day when total prohibition would make
the spectacle of women consuming alcoholic beverages at any time,
much less in public, would be a thing of the past.</p>

<p>It was in their excursion round her societies afterwards that
filled Amy's cup of happiness to overflowing. They spent a
rapturous half hour at the League for the Suppression of Alcohol.
Mr. Senior listened with profound interest to the Secretary's
statistics. His eyes took on the expression of one listening to
inspired harmonies. Then he capped all by, without prompting,
handing a cheque for twenty-five guineas to the Secretary,
becoming, thereby, a life member of the League.</p>

<p>At each office at which they called, its funds were from five
to ten guineas better for the coming of Mr. Senior.</p>

<p>But he was at his best at the rooms of the Moral Uplift
Society. He made innumerable enquiries as to its aims and the
methods employed by its officers. When Amy was moved to tell him
how Mr. Jones was rather like warm in his interest in this work,
Mr. Senior was almost incredulous. He agreed with her that Mr.
Jones must have failed to grasp the importance of the work being
done. And when he passed over a pink slip empowering his bank to
pay "Moral Uplift Society or Bearer" one hundred pounds, Amy
exclaimed with gushing sincerity, "Oh, you must be a saint, Mr.
Senior!"</p>

<p>That gentleman gently, and very modestly, disclaimed any right
to such a distinction.</p>

<p>Afterwards, on her way home, Amy, by some earnest mental
calculation, estimated that their outing must have cost Mr.
Senior something like two hundred and sixty pounds.</p>

<p>Before stepping in to her own car, which she had ordered by
telephone to meet her, Amy had extracted a promise from her
friend that he would dine with her and meet her husband. "Tydvil
is a tower of strength to me," she assured him.</p>

<p>Standing bare-headed at her car door, he thanked her for an
educational and inspiring afternoon, and told her how much he was
looking forward to meeting Mr. Jones, and any others of her co-
workers as well.</p>

<p>Amy was late in arriving home that afternoon, although she had
left Mr. Senior with ample time at her disposal. The delay was
caused by nearly an hour spent in trying on hats at one of those
retiring little shops where the most becoming headgear could be
purchased&mdash;at a price.</p>

<p>Even the message by telephone with which her maid met her, to
the effect that Mr. Jones was delayed at the office and would not
be home to dinner, did not upset her genial mood. A royal row
with Tydvil after dinner would be packing too much joy into one
day.</p>

<p>She dined alone in solitary state. The maid who waited on her
came to the kitchen later with a tale passing all comprehension.
She related to her frankly dubious colleagues that Amy had kept
dinner waiting while she changed her frock and put on a dinner
gown, just to feed by herself.</p>

<p>"Amy's going gay," chirped the cook, pirouetting about her
domain. "What a lark!"</p>

<hr>

<a name="ch15"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p>Tydvil Jones passed the afternoon in an intensive
concentration on his work. Only by so doing could he get through
the long hours before the evening. He gave Geraldine very little
time to consider her own worries, for which she was inwardly
gratified.</p>

<p>Leaving instructions that he might be back to work during the
evening, Tydvil left his office at five o'clock. His unusual
lunch and his excitement combined to make dinner unthinkable. To
fill in the intervening time, he walked through the Alexandra
Gardens&mdash;and, without knowing it, was passed by Amy in her
car as he crossed Princes Bridge. Fortunately, Amy also, was too
much occupied with her own thoughts to be alive to anything
mundane.</p>

<p>Then, after spending an hour in the library of the Y.M.C.A.,
he returned to his office at the appointed time. In compliance
with his orders, a few lights had been left burning on the ground
floor. When he gained his office, he found Mr. Senior already
awaiting him.</p>

<p>That gentleman received his warm thanks for averting the
calamity of Amy's descent on the office with a smile. "You have
no idea what an agreeable afternoon I have spent. Really, I find
I have a great deal to learn from your world today."</p>

<p>Tydvil looked a little surprised. "Can we teach you anything
at all?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, of course, the broad principles are always the same,"
answered Mr. Senior, "but in technique and finish, some of your
methods promise an interesting study. Oh, by the way, I have had
the pleasure of Mrs. Jones's society all the afternoon. We
lunched at Menzies..."</p>

<p>"What?" The question fairly exploded from Tydvil's lips. "Say
that again!"</p>

<p>Mr. Senior looked embarrassed. "I trust that in taking Mrs.
Jones to Menzies I have not committed an indiscretion."</p>

<p>"My wife had lunch with you at...?"</p>

<p>Mr. Senior nodded. "You see..." he began to explain.</p>

<p>But what he would have said was cut short by an outburst of
mirth from Tydvil, who lay back in his chair the better to absorb
the idea. "My dear sir," he said, only partially recovered,
"please forgive my rudeness, but you took me by surprise."</p>

<p>"So long as you are not annoyed," replied his friend.</p>

<p>"Annoyed!" and again Jones gave way to his mirth. "Why, your
news enchants me. If I had any reason to doubt your bona fides,
that alone would prove your case. Only Your Highness could have
achieved such a feat."</p>

<p>"To be frank," replied Mr. Senior, "I was rather flattering
myself on the performance. But actually the credit is due to the
Archbishop of Canterbury."</p>

<p>"He would be proud if he knew," Tydvil chuckled. "I will not
enquire how he came into the picture, but I am most grateful to
him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should tell you," Mr. Senior said, "that since we
parted this morning I have been enquiring into your affairs, and
have ascertained the reason of your disinclination to meet your
wife." Then he added hastily, "Believe me, it was not impertinent
curiosity that prompted me. I felt that an understanding of the
situation would be mutually helpful."</p>

<p>Tydvil waved away the apology as unnecessary. "As a matter of
fact, I am glad you know all. It will save explanations." Then,
after a pause, "Since you know all, you understand?" There was
enquiry in his voice.</p>

<p>"Everything!" the other said earnestly. "And I hope you will
believe me when I say you have my profound sympathy."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Tydvil, more earnestly. "I heard a Russian
proverb once, that ran, 'Only their owner knows where his fleas
bite him.'"</p>

<p>"There is an Oriental proverb also," responded Mr. Senior,
"that says 'The husbands of talkative wives shall have great
rewards hereafter,' and that is as true as many other wise
sayings. And now," he said, standing up, "about your own affairs,
Mr. Jones."</p>

<p>"Suppose you drop the 'Mr.'," said Tydvil tentatively. "It
seems very formal since we are to see so much of one
another."</p>

<p>Mr. Senior smiled a big, friendly smile. "Gladly, provided you
reciprocate and call me Nicholas."</p>

<p>"Oh!" The idea seemed to Tydvil to border on impertinence.</p>

<p>"But I would like it, really," replied his friend
reassuringly. "Do you know, since I met you, and then Mrs. Jones,
I feel it would be a pleasure to help you to make up for lost
time."</p>

<p>"Well, in that case, we'll make it so," and the two shook
hands.</p>

<p>"Now tell me," asked Nicholas, "what form do you propose to
adopt?"</p>

<p>Tydvil thought a moment. "Am I in any way limited in my
choice?"</p>

<p>Nicholas shook his head. "The whole world is yours."</p>

<p>"Well, I have a young man in my service named William Brewer.
Do you know him?"</p>

<p>Senior drew his ledger card from his pocket and studied it
carefully. Then, regarding Jones with raised eyebrows, he emitted
a long whistle. "An ideal model for a night out," he said with a
light laugh. "Your Mr. Brewer has quite a record, although he
seems to have been spoiling it lately, apparently because of some
sentimental attachment."</p>

<p>He waved his hands over Mr. Jones, and that gentleman vanished
and William Brewer stood in his place.</p>

<p>Tydvil started in astonishment. A moment earlier he had been
wearing blue serge. Now, his outstretched arm showed grey tweed.
With a bewildered look in one eye, he turned to the mirror and
gasped. There, looking back at him, was Brewer to the last hair.
The multicoloured eye that so distinguished his prototype was
there to its ultimate shade of blue&mdash;a contingency that he
had overlooked.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" he exclaimed, "I had forgotten that eye. Could
you...?"</p>

<p>For answer, Nicholas pressed his fingers to the swollen face
and all trace of swelling and discolouration vanished. "How's
that?", he asked.</p>

<p>The more Tydvil examined his new individuality, the more
satisfied he felt. With a grin on Billy's handsome face, he
turned to Senior. "True, 0 friend, I am feeling a new man.
Ethically, I'm afraid my action is indefensible. I feel like a
forgery."</p>

<p>"Pah!" Senior said. "Ethics, my dear Tydvil, are no more than
a moral loincloth. Get back to Eden and live your life
unashamed."</p>

<p>Jones stared at him a moment. "I wonder...?" He paused, a
little embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"It was your mention of Eden," went on Tydvil. "Was there any
truth in that story?"</p>

<p>"About my first appearance on the stage as a serpent?" queried
the other with a smile, "before ethics and loincloths were
invented."</p>

<p>Tydvil nodded.</p>

<p>"Just consider the probabilities, my friend," replied Senior
seating himself on the corner of the table and lighting a
cigarette. "Is it likely that any being, human or otherwise, who
wished to win a woman's confidence, would attempt to do so in the
form of a snake? A snake, mind you! Why, it would scare her into
hysterics for a start. The thing's childish."</p>

<p>"It does seem hardly feasible," Tydvil admitted.</p>

<p>"Mind you," continued Nicholas, "there is ground for the
story, but not for the published details. It is just a sample of
the injustice done me for ages. The fact was, it was just female
cussedness; There was Eve, with no housekeeping; no dress to
occupy her mind; with no man to flirt with or woman to gossip
with; and, of course, she discovered and committed the only
mischief there was to commit. Serpent be hanged!" he finished
with a gesture of disgust.</p>

<p>"'Satan finds some mischief still,'" Tydvil quoted absently,
and then broke off as he realised what he was saying.</p>

<p>"That's another!" said Nicholas bitterly. "I find mischief!
Umph! There's no need; they find it themselves and then blame it
on to me. Confounded injustice! However, let's forget it. You'll
need some money if you're going to have a night out."</p>

<p>"Almost forgot!" said Tydvil, going to his private cash box.
From this he took three five-pound notes, and five ones, and
placed them in a wallet he found in his pocket. Then he turned
suddenly. "Oh, look here! Suppose I wish to return to my own
shape, what do I do?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"I'll be at your instant call," replied Senior. "No need to
worry. If you get into difficulties of any kind, just call.
Remember our bond."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" said Tydvil glancing at the clock, which showed
it wanted but ten minutes to eight. "And now, I'll move off."</p>

<p>"Have you any plans?" asked Nicholas.</p>

<p>Jones shook his head. "Not a plan. I intend to let events
shape themselves. I've no doubt that a man who looks for
amusement in the city will find it."</p>

<p>Senior laughed shortly. "From the little I have seen of it, I
have no doubts whatever."</p>

<p>Tydvil paused a moment and then said a little doubtfully, "Do
you know, Nicholas, it has just occurred to me that I wouldn't
know how to get into mischief."</p>

<p>Rubbing a shapely chin with his forefinger, Nicholas reassured
him. "My dear fellow, you will be astonished at the ease with
which you will succeed, even without trying. That should be the
least of your worries. Well, I'll leave you now. But remember,
you've only to call." The next moment Tydvil was alone in his
office.</p>

<hr>

<a name="ch16"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p>Tydvil took one last look at Billy's face in the mirror, then,
taking his hat, he let himself out of the warehouse into Flinders
Lane. Slowly he strolled towards the corner of Swanston Street,
where he stood for a while. The inward human night traffic was at
its flood. The footpaths were thronged with the theatre crowds
and the swift procession of motor cars and trams sped past him
going north. As they passed him, Tydvil caught glimpses of dainty
and beautiful women, part of a life of which he knew nothing.</p>

<p>A flaming sky sign caught his eye, lettering in white against
a black cloud background the words, "The Red Haired Girl. His
Majesty's Theatre." The words winked and disappeared, and
returned in a moment, leering invitation.</p>

<p>Then Tydvil really began to think. He had remembered reading
letters in his morning paper signed, "Shocked" and "Not a
Puritan." They suggested to him that "The Red Haired Girl" ran
true to the tradition of red hair. Tydvil squared his shoulders
and decided that he, too, Tydvil Jones, would see "The Red Haired
Girl" and be shocked also. He had never been properly shocked in
his life, and imagined the experience might prove
interesting.</p>

<p>He turned, and as he did so, another idea struck him. He had
never tasted alcohol. "Why not?" Oh, there were so many things he
had never done! There was a brass plate on a nearby door labelled
"Saloon Bar." Tydvil had no idea what a bar, either saloon or
public, looked like. Now was the time to learn.</p>

<p>He took one step towards the door when a mighty hand fell on
his shoulder and a mighty voice, undoubtedly breathing
goodfellowship, thundered, "Billy! Billy, you old kerfoosalem!
How are you?"</p>

<p>"The old kerfoosalem" turned round to face a large stranger,
by no means sharing the delight of his greeting, though he tried
hard to give the impression that he did.</p>

<p>"Halo, old chap!' he said with enforced heartiness. This, he
thought, was non-committal.</p>

<p>"Billy, you dear old blighter," exclaimed the other warmly, "I
knew I would butt into you somewhere among the bright lights.
Biggest joke in the world. Thought I saw you crossing Flinders
Street just now carrying a dandy black eye. Dashed traffic
blocked me, and I missed whoever it was. Dead spit of you. Funny,
wasn't it?"</p>

<p>Tydvil succeeding in making himself grin to register
amusement. "Very funny!" he said dryly. His mind was whirling
with plans to shake off this exuberant friend, who, he discovered
was, if not quite intoxicated, well on the way, and sufficiently
so to have reached the stage at which appearance and conventions
were of no account.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't have missed you tonight for the world," announced
the unsober one in loud-speaker tones. He let go Tydvil's arm and
felt in his pocket, "King Rufus led all the way. Here you are."
He drew out a roll of notes and peeling off five fivers, he
pressed them into Tydvil's unwilling hand.</p>

<p>"Said I'd pay you back tonight, now, didn' I? Didn' I say,
alive or dead, Jerry McCann would pay you back that twenny-five
quid? Eh?" he insisted.</p>

<p>"Of course you did, Jerry," Jones admitted, thankful to have
discovered a name if not an identity. "But, look here," he
protested, "don't give it to me now. Keep it till we meet
again."</p>

<p>The other blinked at him. "Don' be a bloomin' fool, Billy," he
urged. "Don' act the goat. Take it. If you don' I'll only get
blithered and it will go." He raised his voice so that a passing
policeman turned a searching eye on the two. "Good ole Billy.
Allers did help a pal."</p>

<p>To Tydvil, the situation was impossible. He felt hot flushes
crawling all over him. He felt he had narrowly escaped meeting
the genuine Billy Brewer. Now, at all costs, he must shake off
Billy's beery friend. "Look here, Jerry," he said firmly, "I've
got an appointment I must keep. Thanks for the money, but I'll
just have to go." He jerked his sleeve from the hand that held it
with a curt "Good night!" and walked swiftly towards Collins
Street.</p>

<p>The other stood watching the retreating hat bobbing above the
crowd. His world had crashed on him. He had just paid Billy
Brewer a debt that was six months overdue and Billy, who in
normal circumstances would have helped him make a night of it,
had walked off and never even asked him to have a drink&mdash;and
a bar door within twenty feet of them.</p>

<p>Jerry watched Billy till he disappeared, then, still
wondering, he stepped back off the kerb into the roadway where
his fate was accomplished by a heavy limousine. Tydvil Jones was
too far off to hear the cry, or to see the crowd that gathered as
the limp figure was lifted from the blocks.</p>

<p>Little dreaming that Jerry had been gathered to the Mercy of
Allah, Tydvil turned into Collins Street in order to avoid
pursuit. It had come home to him with some force that in adopting
Billy's person, he was adopting with it some no slight risks.
However, the risk, whatever it might be, added spice to the
adventure&mdash;after all, was he not seeking adventure?</p>

<p>Tydvil had reached Elizabeth Street and turned towards Bourke
Street, when again the words "Saloon Bar" arrested his attention.
Then, since there was no Jerry McCann to intervene, without
hesitation he passed through the multicoloured glass door and
along a heavily carpeted corridor into a small but brilliantly
lighted room at the end.</p>

<p>To Tydvil's relief there were no customers at the counter that
ran along the whole of one side. At the further end from where he
stood, behind the counter, were two girls in deep converse. One,
with a sleek, black head, was seated, the other, a blonde of
surpassing blondeness, was standing before her. They were quite
oblivious of Tydvil's presence, so he had ample time to take in
the details at his leisure.</p>

<p>The mirrored walls and the close array of bottles and cut
glass flashed under the electric light. So this was the abode of
sin against which he had raised his voice so earnestly on
numberless occasions. As he gazed, the blonde moved slightly and
gave him a better view of her companion. Jones wondered how one
so petite could possess such amazing eyes and such a pink bud for
a mouth. Had he but known it, his admiration of the two presiding
angels at the Carillion bar was heartily endorsed by the leading
authorities of the city.</p>

<p>Tydvil inwardly raged at the shyness that kept him glued as he
stood staring at the two damsels. It needed all his strength to
save him from taking flight. Then, suddenly the two dazzling eyes
of the brunette turned full on him. As they did so their
expression of indifference turned into evident surprise and
pleasure that had a magical effect on Tydvil's nerves. His heart
gave two big, bumps, and his bashfulness vanished.</p>

<p>The brunette had risen to her feet. "Connie, look!" she
exclaimed. "Look at the villain of the piece."</p>

<p>Then she of the massed blonde hair turned on Tydvil two of the
softest blue smiling eyes he had ever seen, or, at any rate, had
ever noticed.</p>

<p>"Billy," she said gently as he stood before them (he never
knew how he crossed the room), "Billy, you're the quintessence of
a disagreeable piggy. Where have you been all these centuries?"
The unflattering epithet, falling from a perfect cupid's bow
mouth, seemed almost a caress.</p>

<p>"Dooce of a lot of work," said Tydvil, off-handedly.
"Positively could not get round."</p>

<p>The two exchanged glances, and the smaller shook a white,
pink-nailed finger at him. "Dooce of a lot of work!" she mimicked
derisively. "Do you think we never hear anything? Dooce of a lot
of red-headed typist! That's your work, Mr. Billy Brewer."</p>

<p>The charge, unexpected as it was, made Jones forget for the
moment his borrowed individuality. He disgraced Billy Brewer by a
rich, all-embracing blush. The two stared at the mounting colour
with amazement, and peals of merry laughter filled the bar.
"Billy, you've blushed! Connie and I will get in our breach of
promise writs before the rush sets in. Oh, Billy! You swore you
would never love anyone but us."</p>

<p>"Look here!" he objected indignantly, "it's not true..."</p>

<p>"The Lord don't love liars, Billy," said Connie shaking her
head. Then, turning, she placed a bottle of whisky and a glass
before him. Those were the days when the customer said
"When."</p>

<p>Tydvil had scarcely bargained for that. He was doubtful if
Billy Brewer's body carried that gentleman's capacity for
absorbing whisky without calamitous results, or his own
incapacity. He determined to play for safety. "Not that," he
said, glancing at the bottle, "I'll take claret and lemonade."
Again the bar rang and rippled with laughter.</p>

<p>"Sure you don't mean milk and soda?" giggled Millie. "You are
a break-up, Billy." As she spoke, she poured a generous first
mate's snifter into the tumbler and passed it across to him. At
the same time Connie placed a bubbling bottle of soda water
beside it.</p>

<p>"Lap it up like a good boy," Connie laughed, "and forget the
red-head a minute. Jerry McCann was in looking for you a little
while ago."</p>

<p>Recognising that the claret and lemonade position was
untenable, Tydvil filled the glass with soda, determined to play
his part for the honour of Billy Brewer&mdash;he owed him that
much.</p>

<p>"I saw Jerry just now in Swanston Street," he said as he took
up his glass. "I should say he had been here," he added with
meaning.</p>

<p>Millie nodded. "He was a bit damp round the edges," she
commented, "so Connie wouldn't give him any whisky. You'd have
laughed to hear her 'kidding him to be good and go home. Talked
sister stuff to him and managed to make him swallow two glasses
of Spa water."</p>

<p>"He wasn't too bad when I saw him," said Tydvil, inwardly
amazed that the girls he thought would be sirens would go to the
trouble to protect Jerry from himself. This was a new angle on
barmaids.</p>

<p>Connie laughed. "He would have been worse if I hadn't squeezed
out two big tears and pleaded with him. It was the tears that did
it. Look, Billy." She blinked her heavy lashed lids quickly and
looked into Tydvil's eyes. As she did, the big blue orbs swam
with an appeal that might have softened the heart of the
Commissioner of Taxes. A little soft hand fell on the big one of
Tydvil that rested on the counted. "Billy," she murmured, "lap it
up for my sake."</p>

<p>Tydvil, under those appealing eyes, began to feel queer. He,
Tydvil Jones, of all men, felt an irresistible urge to kiss the
owner of those blue eyes. But Connie, evidently diagnosing the
symptoms from experience, withdrew from the danger zone.</p>

<p>"Little kidder, isn't she?" laughed Millie.</p>

<p>"Little devil!" retorted Tydvil, and raising the glass to his
lips he sent the C6 0 H + Soda to the ultimate destination of all
such mixtures, in two gulps. The spirit caught his throat and
made him feel for the moment as though he had swallowed a jazz
band wrapped in barbed wire. He concealed is emotions admirably,
and replaced the glass on the counter as though the rite were
mere routine.</p>

<p>"Good boy," laughed Connie. "Took his medicine like a little
man. Now he'll have strength enough to pay over that eleven
quid."</p>

<p>Jones gasped. "Eh! Eleven&mdash;eh&mdash;for a drink! Why I
paid you..."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly! Why, you promised you would put that pound on
King Rufus for me..."</p>

<p>Jones was no fool, and hastily recognised that with Billy's
individuality he had assumed his liabilities, and he must meet
them so as to leave no reflection on Billy's good name. The
transaction evidently demanded immediate settlement. Without a
moment's further hesitation he pulled out a wad of notes and paid
over.</p>

<p>"Lucky wog, Connie! Wish I'd invested, too," remarked
Millie.</p>

<p>Connie turned aside and lifted a tiny suede-cased foot to the
chair. There was a flirt of skirt, a flashing glimpse of deep red
garter, a snap of elastic, and the notes disappeared.</p>

<p>"Huzzy!" said Tydvil, playfully; rather more moved than he had
been by the whisky.</p>

<p>The girl's eyes twinkled with amusement. "Shouldn't have
looked, Billy," she said. "I notice you didn't blush that
time."</p>

<p>There came a sound of voices from the corridor. Tydvil took
fright. "I'm off," he said. "Goodnight, girls." But it was too
late. Entered three jovial souls who hailed him as a brother.</p>

<p>Tydvil thought swiftly. "No good, you chaps. One more and I'm
off. Got an appointment; positively! Can't wait, a fact!" He
spoke convincingly.</p>

<p>Loud were the protests. They were looking for a game of
"draw." But Jones did not dare risk more than two drinks. The one
he had already was feeling its way round happily. He paid for one
more and, despite their chaff which imputed scandalous motives
for his desertion, he turned and fled.</p>

<hr>

<a name="ch17"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p>Out in the street again, Tydvil felt a hitherto unknown sense
of exhilaration and courage. The world looked brighter. With two
whiskies under his vest he squared his shoulders and made his way
up Bourke Street with one object in view, "The Red Haired
Girl."</p>

<p>As he went he pondered on the coincidence that mixed Billy,
Geraldine Brand, and the show he hoped to see. On his way he was
saluted by name several times by unknown men, but he flung them a
curt "goodnight," without pausing.</p>

<p>He had turned into Exhibition Street. Another twenty yards
would have brought him to the door of the theatre, when a light
touch fell on his arm, and a soft voice murmured, "Billy! 0,
Billy! At last!"</p>

<p>Jones looked down at the owner of the voice, and for the
second time that night his heart gave an unaccustomed jump.</p>

<p>She was something like that lovely little Millie he had just
left. Though it were hardly possible&mdash;prettier! Her eyes
were as big and bright, but they held nothing of Millie's
reserve. As they looked up into Tydvil's face they were frankly
adoring eyes. Jones began to think that Billy Brewer's reputation
had been scandalously under-estimated.</p>

<p>He realised that he was on ground that was both hazardous and
delicate. Unless he moved with circumspection, he might come a
cropper of colossal dimensions. However, thanks to the two
snifters of Scotch, he felt equal to any emergency.</p>

<p>"Hallo, little girl!" he smiled back into her eyes, "where
were you off to?"</p>

<p>Two red petals pouted at him, and there was just a hint of
storm in the big eyes. "Billy, you know quite well I was just
getting home. Don't be silly and pretend. Why didn't you come
when I wrote?"</p>

<p>"Wrote!" protested Tydvil, playing for time and enlightenment.
"Honest, I never got the letter."</p>

<p>"Now, Billy," she persisted suspiciously, "I wrote twice."</p>

<p>"I'll swear on my honour, I never got any letter," he asserted
virtuously.</p>

<p>"Well, I posted them..." she began.</p>

<p>"Look here!" he interrupted, "what's the use of wrangling. I
was just going to the show. Come in with me."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "What's the use? I've seen it twice
already, and I want to talk to you. Take me somewhere to dinner,
Billykins!" she coaxed.</p>

<p>Tydvil did some more swift thinking. True, he had sought
adventure. Again, why not? "All right," he yielded. "Where'll we
go?"</p>

<p>She mentioned the name of a restaurant the fame of which had
reached even the virtuous ears of Tydvil-Jones-before-the-fall.
The new Tydvil agreed without hesitation.</p>

<p>The driver of a hansom, wise in his years and his calling, had
his eyes on the pair as they talked. He sent out a swift "Keb,
sir?" Tydvil nodded, and the cab drew to the kerb. She put her
hand on his arm, about to step into the cab, when Jones happened
to glance over his shoulder. He had suffered a succession of
shocks that night. But when he looked into the hostile blazing
eyes of Geraldine Brand, who was passing not six feet away with
two other girls, his nerve almost failed him.</p>

<p>For a second, he forgot he was Billy Brewer. It 'was Tydvil
Jones, who, in such a compromising situation, wilted under the
relentless judgment of those eyes. It was only for a second
though. His hand went to his hat, but Geraldine, with her head
high, turned haughtily away. Tydvil whistled softly to
himself.</p>

<p>His companion, who had missed not a detail of the encounter,
entered the cab without a word. Jones named his destination to
the driver and took his place beside her. The moment he was
seated she turned on him. "Now, Billy, who was that red-headed
she cat?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Tydvil with an air of engaging
innocence.</p>

<p>The woman beside him bit her lip. When she spoke he felt that
tears were very near the surface. "Oh, Billy, I used to think you
cared, and that you were something better than the rest! Who is
she?" The last words were a demand not to be denied.</p>

<p>Almost like Amy, reflected Jones. Then he said, "The girl who
passed just now was only one of the typists from the office."</p>

<p>She was silent a moment, and then said with deep conviction,
"Billy, I think you are the most brutal, callous, hard-hearted
devil that ever lived."</p>

<p>"Just because a girl looked at me," he said in an injured
tone. "I couldn't help her looking at me."</p>

<p>She laughed shortly. "That wildcat didn't look at you as
though she would like to scratch you, for nothing." She paused,
and then went on. "I wonder how many others there are as well. I
positively, know five now. There are Alma, Joyce, Clara Butler,
Vivian Granger, that red-headed fury&mdash;and&mdash;I might as
well add my own name, Hilda Cranston, a fool, and at your
service."</p>

<p>The name gave Tydvil a jolt, for he knew there was a Cranston
on the pay-roll of Craddock, Burns and Despard&mdash;and he
wondered. But he had small time for wondering. He was busy making
Billy Brewer's peace with an angry woman, though he had his
suspicions that Billy would not thank him for the service. By the
time they reached their destination, he had succeeded in
establishing a truce.</p>

<p>Here a new problem presented itself. He managed to secure a
quiet and unobtrusive table in a corner of the crowded room. When
she peeled off her gloves and passed them over to him to put in
his pocket, he noticed that the fourth finger of her left hand
was encircled by a plain thin gold band.</p>

<p>Hilda took the menu card Tydvil handed to her and glanced at
him over its edge. "Let's do the ordering, Billy," she asked.
Anxious to do anything that might conciliate her, he acquiesced.
All the more gladly because he was himself uncertain what would
be the correct thing to offer his partner in the
circumstances.</p>

<p>"Can I make it willing, dear?" That "dear" was an emblem of
peace. "How's the exchequer, boy?"</p>

<p>"Go to the limit," Tydvil agreed, secure in a well-filled
wallet. "The exchequer is not only healthy, it's robust. I backed
King Rufus today." He felt almost proud of the way the name of a
horse, the existence of which he had been ignorant of an hour
earlier, slipped off his tongue.</p>

<p>"How glorious!" Her eyes sparkled. "We'll have a big bottle of
bubbles, too."</p>

<p>The waiter was standing beside her, and Jones watched in no
little amazement her assured and self-possessed air as she
enumerated her requirements. There was only a little hesitation
when she came to the wine. "Which, Billy?" she said, glancing
over at him.</p>

<p>He laughed. The names were Greek to him. "You said you were
giving the order, and I'll take you at your word."</p>

<p>She named the wine and the man enquired, very respectfully,
"Vintage, sir?" Tydvil had no idea what the word implied, but
nodded, and the man went on his way.</p>

<p>The next two hours of Tydvil Jones' life remained afterwards
as a blurred impression of soft music, white arms and shoulders,
shaded lights, strange and delectable food and stranger and more
delectable drinks. He did not know what was in the cocktail with
which that repast commenced, but it tasted like liquid happiness.
When he swallowed it, it obliterated all care of past or future
from his mind. Tydvil lived in the present only. A glowing
present of a heady illusive perfume that drifted across the table
to him, and of eyes that told things of which Tydvil Jones had
never dreamed.</p>

<p>He took his fair share of the wine that sparkled, and found it
good. After the first glass he found himself saying things that
could only have obtained their brilliance from "beaded bubbles
winking at the brim" of the long-stemmed glass beside him.</p>

<p>"Billy," she said at the last, "you've been delightful
tonight. I'll forgive you even that red-headed cat, but you'll
have to see me home."</p>

<p>Tydvil Jones, the once Tydvil Jones, faintly, whispered
caution. Two robust Scotch whiskies, a sidecar, a glass of
sherry, three glasses of vintage wine and a benedictine all
shouted, "Why not?" and all cheered together when Tydvil Jones
threw his life's training and all discretion to the winds, and
told her he would see her to the end of the world and beyond,
provided she brought her dimples with her.</p>

<p>In Collins Street as they stood on the footpath, she said,
"Don't take a taxi, Billykins, get a hansom, taxis are too
quick," and as she commanded, so it was done. There was one
anxious moment, however, when the cab drew up. To where was he to
tell the man to drive? But Tydvil found himself as full of
devices as he was of high spirits. "Don't you think we had better
not drive to the house?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, dear," she conceded. "No use attracting
attention. Tell him to put us down at the corner of Fitzroy and
Acland Streets."</p>

<p>Jones gave the man his sailing orders and took his seat. It
was not until they had crossed Princes Bridge that she spoke
again. "There's not much need to worry, though. He's in
Sydney."</p>

<p>Tydvil gave an interrogative, "Oh?"</p>

<p>"I thought you would have known he had his holidays. That's
why I wrote."</p>

<p>At that moment two and two added themselves together in
Tydvil's mind. Cranston, the head of the Manchester Department,
was on his annual leave. He recollected that Cranston, whom he
liked least of his staff, had mentioned he was going to Sydney.
When in the friendly obscurity a soft arm stole round his neck,
it suddenly occurred to Tydvil that Cranston must have treated
this little woman abominably; aye, and neglected her, too. How
else would she so crave love and sympathy. He felt it almost a
duty to comfort her.</p>

<p>Let us not hold a brief for Tydvil Jones, but let us be just,
and let him, who says he would have resisted where Tydvil fell
short of his early standards, remember the fate of Ananias. The
hansom rolled along St. Kilda Road, and as it rolled, Tydvil
started in pursuit of those dimples. But in spite of strict
attention to the business in hand, he had not captured one by the
time the cab stopped. Unnoticed, he had passed his home where he
had fully intended to escape.</p>

<p>He could scarcely believe that the five miles had not been
done at a speed of twenty miles an hour, so brief had been the
journey. He assisted Hilda to alight. Absently he gave the cabby
the note that was uppermost in his wallet, and told him to keep
the change&mdash;which amounted to four pounds twelve shillings
and sixpence. Tydvil's troubles!</p>

<p>Taking her arm and shortening his step to hers, they turned
into Acland Street and presently, turned again down one of the
side streets leading to the esplanade. At the gate Hilda paused.
Jones opened it and stepped into the little garden. "Goodnight,
little girl," he said, "I'll have to get home. It is nearly
eleven."</p>

<p>She put her hand on his shoulder and looked up at him. "Oh,
Billykins, just half an hour. Come in with me. There's not a soul
in the house."</p>

<p>Again we can hold no brief for Tydvil, and can make no
concession to his weakness. His behaviour was deserving of the
severest censure. Still, perhaps Amy and Hilda were not
altogether blameless. Mr. Nicholas Senior might apportion the
blame fairly.</p>

<p>Hilda opened the door with a latchkey, and switched on a light
in the passage. She led Tydvil to a small room half way, down it.
There was a large, heavily-shaded kerosene lamp on the table,
which she lit, and then switched off the electric light. Turning
to him, she said, "Wait a little, Billy, I shan't be long," and
he found himself alone.</p>

<p>It was a dainty and cosy apartment, and Tydvil sank into an
armchair with a feeling of intense well-being and comfort. The
silence was only broken by the busy ticking of a travelling
clock. Minutes passed. Then he heard a door open down the
passage. Then a "swish, swish," which made his heart go
faster.</p>

<p>She stood in the doorway smiling at him. It must have been a
lightning change, for, in place of the walking frock, she was
wearing a long, soft, neckless, sleeveless robe that suited and
fitted her to perfection. How it retained the status quo in
defiance of the laws of gravity was a mystery to Tydvil. She
kissed the tips of fingers to him, and with her hand motioned him
not to rise.</p>

<p>There was a little cupboard in the corner, and to this she
went. From it came a cheerful clinking, and when she turned she
bore two glasses and a small foiled bottle which she placed on
the table. "Billy," she said, "one more little one won't do us
any harm. I've been keeping this for you."</p>

<p>The original Tydvil had considerable doubts on her optimism.
The present emancipated Jones agreed heartily. He had never seen,
he thought, a more charming picture than she made in her new
robe. Tydvil put the thought into words as he watched her deftly
unwire the bottle. She positively refused to allow him to assist.
With a table napkin to act as silencer and splashboard, the cork
came out with a friendly "pop." Then she sent the wine creaming
into two glasses without losing a precious drop. One she handed
to him, and, taking the other, she perched herself on the arm of
his chair.</p>

<p>"So you like my frock," she said as she leaned over him.</p>

<p>He placed his glass on the table and looked up at her. "What
there is of it is perfect," he said, "but I think I like what
there isn't of it better."</p>

<p>She took a sip from her glass and held it to his lips. "That's
for paying pretty compliments..."</p>

<p>Of what happened next, Tydvil was never quite sure. There was
a sudden crash of glass and rending of curtains, and across the
table he saw three men confronting him, and the leader and most
conspicuous was Mr. Samuel Cranston, who, according to his own
story, should have been six hundred miles away in
Sydney&mdash;but who evidently was not.</p>

<p>Hilda emitted a startled cry, but Tydvil was, for the moment,
too overcome by the catastrophe to move.</p>

<p>The expression of Samuel Cranston was hostile in the extreme.
He glared ferociously as, with two hands clenched on the table,
he leaned forward to deliver himself of speech. Behind him, two
unpleasant looking men, evidently private detectives, stood in
support. There was a ring of triumph in the rage that shook
Cranston's voice. "Got you!" he snarled. "Got you at last, Mr.
so-and-so Brewer! And you'll pay for it!"</p>

<p>Two thoughts flashed through Tydvil's mind. One was that the
situation presented more grounds for action than argument. There
was simply nothing to be said. The other was that every
circumstance of the case demanded swift and, if possible,
masterly retreat. It meant a retreat, too, encumbered by his
baggage, though he, himself, did not regard Hilda in exactly that
light.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet. The whole scene was a matter of seconds
from the moment of the explosion. Hilda, he noted with
satisfaction, had slipped through the door. As Tydvil moved, the
two detectives started round the table with bellicose intent, and
Cranston, seizing the empty bottle, hurled it at his head. Jones
ducked with a celerity that surprised even himself, and the
bottle shattered a picture on the wall behind him. An instant
later a glass buzzed past his ear.</p>

<p>Attacked in front, and with both flanks menaced, as in all
master minds, thought and action were coincident with Tydvil. He
reached forward and, picking up the lamp, sent it flying at the
infuriated Cranston. There was a crash and a blaze of flame as he
turned and reached the door a hairsbreadth ahead of the nearest
man. Swiftly he pulled it to behind him. He muttered his relief
when he found a key on the outside, and the bolt shot as he
turned it. From the sounds within, the inhabitants of the room
were evidently busy beating out the flames.</p>

<p>Hilda ran before him and opened the front door. "Don't mind
me, Billy," she gasped. "He's frightened of me. I can manage him
easily and am quite safe. Go quickly!"</p>

<p>Tydvil paused a moment to listen to the clamour behind the
locked door. "Sure you will be all right? Better come with
me!"</p>

<p>"Madness, Billy," she answered. "I know best. Go!" He stooped
and kissed her on either cheek, and she laughed lightly as he
turned and fled, heading towards Acland Street.</p>

<p>Tydvil made the pace fairly smart, but kept something in
reserve in case of pursuit, though he felt sure that the trio
would be delayed long enough to give him a good start. In this,
however, he proved a bad judge. He was within fifty yards of
Acland Street when excited noises behind him warned him the hunt
was on.</p>

<p>Concealment was out of the question. Both moon and street
lights were against him. There was a shout of "There he goes!"
and, with the enemy on his track, he began to sprint, still
feeling confident of escape. But his confidence received a shock
when, as he had almost reached the corner, two men turned out of
Acland Street and came towards him.</p>

<p>As they came into view a cry came from his pursuers of, "Stop
thief! Stop him!" and at the cry the newcomers prepared to bar
his progress.</p>

<p>Tydvil's thoughts worked even more swiftly than his legs. In
the brief seconds before the impending collision, he measured his
chances. The new forces were apparently both young, and their
open coats displayed evening dress. Their attitudes bespoke
determination. Shock tactics were the only hope, and he charged
straight at them. Seeing this they closed. As their hands shot
towards him, he hacked one savagely on the shin&mdash;a primitive
and barbaric attack, but effectual. Then he snatched off his hat
and hurled it in the face of the other, and followed it swiftly
with his fist.</p>

<p>The momentary dislocation of their line gave him an
opportunity to burst through, and before they could turn on him
he was round the corner and pelting towards Fitzroy Street. He
knew from the crude and personal remarks that reached him, that
though he had gained another start, he had earned the
uncompromising hostility of two more pursuers. There was no
mistaking the zeal that urged the footsteps that were pattering
swiftly behind him. Worse still, two other figures detached
themselves from the shadows on the opposite side of the street
and joined the hunt, apparently on general principles.</p>

<p>Tydvil's heart began to fail. Not only were the newcomers
gaining, but a glance over his shoulder showed him that they had
been overtaken by Cranston and his unlovely satellites. Now, the
pack, grown to seven, was pounding along behind him, giving
tongue as they ran.</p>

<p>Knowing the locality well, it was a plantation on the other
side of Fitzroy Street, that Tydvil made his objective. When he
reached the corner from which his hoped for sanctuary, came into
view, the chase was not much more than one hundred feet behind
him.</p>

<p>Here, the lights on the corner which revealed him plainly to
his pursuers, showed Jones something that chilled his heart. The
corner of the street had been torn up for some municipal work,
and the piled earth was fenced with hurdles.</p>

<p>Standing by them was what appeared to the flying man as the
most gigantic policeman he had ever laid eyes on. Moreover, the
approaching riot had evidently put him on the alert.</p>

<p>As Tydvil reached the edge of the upturned earth round which
he must race for the chance of safety that was now in view, the
policeman roared a command to halt, and made at him. Necessity
was the mother of Jones as well as of invention in his hour of
peril. Safety or ruin was a matter of seconds. He dropped to his
knees, and as he did so his hand found something comforting:
something cubical and heavy. As the approaching figure towered
over him, Tydvil's hand shot forward. There was the sound of an
anguished grunt, and the Law incarnate crumpled up and crashed
almost on top of him.</p>

<p>At the same instant the chase raged round the corner. Tydvil
started up and fled like a scalded cat across the street to the
shadow of the trees of the plantation, with the howling crew
almost on his heels. Leaving the path, he dashed among the shrubs
and sprawled full length over a surprised couple who were
whispering sweet nothings in the privacy of the shrubbery. The
man seized his foot with an exclamation, highly improper at any
time, but unpardonable in the presence of a lady.</p>

<p>Tydvil kicked desperately and wrenched his foot free. The girl
screamed, and the two men struggled to their feet. The sound of
crashing among the shrubs told Jones that the scream had brought
the pursuit on his track again. Tydvil drove a purposeful knee to
his opponent's waistcoat, and the man went to the grass like a
log. Again a scream from the girl brought an answering cry from
the hunt. In another moment they would be on him. In his
desperation Tydvil remembered. "Nicholas, help! Help me!" he
gasped.</p>

<p>The words were still on his lips when Jones felt himself
wrenched from his feet and swung into the air. There was for a
second, a sensation of breathless flight and he found himself
sitting somewhere, high above the earth, and, he felt assured, in
safety. Where he was he neither knew nor cared. Drawing labouring
breaths, he sat with his face in his hands, listening to excited
voices in the distance. Presently he recovered himself slightly,
but still panting from his flight he sat up and looked round.</p>

<p>Had it not been that any refuge was better than capture,
Tydvil would have been rather scared at the situation in which he
found himself. The first glance showed him that he was sitting on
the parapet, some fifty feet from the ground, of a long range of
terraces overlooking Hobsons Bay. His feet were resting on a
ledge about two feet wide that formed the cornice of the
building. Beside him was a large, ball-shaped cement structure
that formed one of the architectural adornments. On the other
side sat, regarding him with a smiling countenance, Mr. Nicholas
Senior.</p>

<p>The moon that had betrayed the fugitive, had disappeared under
a friendly cloud, but Mr. Senior's countenance was plainly
visible. Jones took in his surroundings for a moment before
speaking. Then, still gasping, he said, "Close shave! Thank
goodness you were at hand. I thought I was gone."</p>

<p>Nicholas laughed. "Goodness had very little to do with any
part of it, I'm afraid. But it was a close shave, as you say. Why
didn't you call sooner?"</p>

<p>"Forgot!" said Mr. Jones shortly. Then he added, anxiously, "I
suppose we are quite safe here?"</p>

<p>"Quite," replied Mr. Senior. "Any port in a storm, you know,
my friend. Of course, I do not wish in any way to interfere in
your amusements, but you seem, for a beginner, to have had a
fairly lively night out. That crowd seemed as angry as a nest of
hornets."</p>

<p>Jones paused to listen to the calls that still rose from the
plantation in the near foreground. Then he gave his friend a
swift outline of his adventures.</p>

<p>"Not too bad!" commented Nicholas appreciatively. "Not bad at
all&mdash;rape, arson and murder, but I've known a fourteenth
century Archbishop to do better before breakfast."</p>

<p>"Oh, you know," protested Tydvil indignantly, "that's hardly a
fair statement, at all!"</p>

<p>"But, don't you see, Tydvil, in these cases it is the
principle that counts? The intention, rather than its
fulfilment."</p>

<p>"But I cannot admit it," argued Jones a little warmly.</p>

<p>"I was certainly injudicious, but the fire caused by the lamp
must have been extinguished without trouble. And the
policeman..." He paused a little doubtfully.</p>

<p>"The least of your lapses," said Nicholas. "You say you only
threw a lump of clay at him. That would not have caused any but a
temporary inconvenience."</p>

<p>Tydvil cleared his throat. "Hum&mdash;yes," he said slowly.
"But, unfortunately, that lump of clay had been baked. In fact,
it was half a brick that checked his advance."</p>

<p>Nicholas Senior chuckled. "Really, I must congratulate you.
You have met serious emergencies with prompt and effectual
methods. Don't worry about the policeman. Risks of the kind are
inseparable from his calling." Here he paused, for the tumult and
the shouting that had died away were resumed with renewed vigour.
There was a stampede below, and the uproar broke out again,
apparently directly below their perch. Looking apprehensively at
Nicholas, Tydvil's arm encircled the concrete ball beside
him.</p>

<p>Leaning forward, Nicholas listened intently. "They seem to
have found someone. Wait! I won't be long." He disappeared as he
spoke.</p>

<p>The last injunction was unnecessary. Tydvil had not the
slightest intention of moving. He clung affectionately, to the
concrete, and stared out across the dark waters of the Bay, to
where the Gellibrand light winked a knowing and wicked red eye at
him.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Mr. Senior was beside him again. He was
laughing heartily, though quietly.</p>

<p>Tydvil turned an enquiring eye on him.</p>

<p>"Upon my word," said Nicholas, "had I planned it myself, I
could not have done better. Your late pursuers have found the
real William Brewer who was passing with two friends."</p>

<p>No words came from Tydvil. He was beyond speech, but his face
was a note of anguished interrogation.</p>

<p>"I left him trying to explain himself, and no one will believe
him. He has been arrested for using abusive language to the
policeman. That policeman is very angry," added Nicholas as an
afterthought.</p>

<a name="ch18"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p>Tydvil felt that, at this juncture, the rescue of Billy Brewer
was the paramount consideration, and said so. Mr. Senior,
however, urged caution. "I can take him from that policeman
without any trouble," he said, "but remember, he is known. That
will mean his re-arrest on another charge."</p>

<p>"But I must do something," Tydvil pleaded. "It is all my
fault, and he is innocent."</p>

<p>"Don't worry," Mr. Senior re-assured him. "I will bail him out
tonight and appear for him in court tomorrow. You can come along
and give evidence if you like."</p>

<p>"That," said Tydvil, "would be very satisfactory, but for the
fact that you and I have not yet met one another."</p>

<p>"Uh," concurred Nicholas.</p>

<p>"The case might reach the papers," Tydvil explained, "and my
wife might wonder&mdash;she's pretty good at wondering."</p>

<p>"Well," Nicholas said thoughtfully, "we must have an
impressive looking counsel&mdash;let me see&mdash;we'll call him
Mr. Olden, K.C. I will contrive to look legal and will arrange it
so that the Court accepts me at face value."</p>

<p>"Good." Tydvil's confidence returned. "But I'm afraid that in
future I must assume a character of my own creation. Duplicates
are likely to be troublesome."</p>

<p>"You must admit, though," laughed Mr. Senior, "that you are
indebted to Brewer for an excellent night's entertainment."</p>

<p>"All the more reason why I should not let him suffer for it,"
retorted Tydvil. "You see, he'll have to do the explaining to
Geraldine Brand and that very insinuating Hilda&mdash;I'm afraid
he will find it rather difficult, too," he added thoughtfully.
Then, with a shiver, for a cool wind was blowing in from the Bay,
"I wish I could have another drink."</p>

<p>Senior immediately produced a silver flask into the cup of
which he poured a liberal dose. Swallowed at one gulp, the
alluring fluid seemed to drench Tydvil's system with courage,
optimism and happiness. He felt that tobacco was the one thing
left to complete his satisfaction with life.</p>

<p>In answer to his request Mr. Senior, the obliging, handed him
a cigar. Forgetting his unusual situation on the housetops, and
careless of consequences, Tydvil struck a match that illuminated
the two figures on the parapet.</p>

<p>From the street below came an excited voice, "Hi, look!"
quickly followed by another, rather more excited, "What are you
men doing up there?"</p>

<p>Earlier in the night, the evidence of his discovery in a
compromising situation would have terrified Tydvil Jones. Now he
only felt annoyance at the challenge to his liberty of action as
a citizen. Cupping his hands to his mouth he responded. "I'm the
Queen of Sheba with King Solomon, and we're taking the
air&mdash;you mud-headed flat-fish!"</p>

<p>"I doubt if they'll accept your explanation," remarked Mr.
Senior judicially.</p>

<p>Evidently he was right. One of the voices shouted, "Police!
Police!"</p>

<p>Mr. Senior's beverage must have been fairly potent, for it was
doubtless that and not Tydvil Jones that replied to the call with
a series of insults, barbaric in their splendour, that could be
heard for hundreds of yards. In a few moments it peopled the
quiet of Beaconsfield Parade with enquiring residents.</p>

<p>"I think," remarked Mr. Senior as the clamour below grew
louder, "that we would be wiser to leave."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right," conceded Tydvil, "those people don't
seem to like us."</p>

<p>"Where to?" asked Nicholas.</p>

<p>"I think I'll call it a night&mdash;take me home, Nicholas,"
replied Tydvil.</p>

<p>A second later Tydvil found himself in the drive before his
house on St. Kilda Road. He was ignorant of the fact, that for
nearly two hours afterwards, police and citizen helpers swarmed
over the roofs of terraces on Beaconsfield Parade, searching
diligently for two mysterious malefactors.</p>

<p>Promising to meet him at the court next morning at ten
o'clock, Nicholas left Tydvil to his own devices. He marched
light-heartedly to his own door. His mood was one of genial
satisfaction and peace and good will. His resentment against even
Amy had vanished. He felt for his latch key, but his pocket was
empty. A moment later he pounded the door vigorously, with the
bronze knocker.</p>

<p>Amy had dismissed the maids for the night and was awaiting
Tydvil's arrival. She, too, for her own purposes, had decided not
to re-open hostilities for the moment. The spell of that charming
Mr. Senior was still strong upon her. Rather surprised at a
caller at nearly midnight, she hastened to answer the summons at
the front door.</p>

<p>She was still more surprised when she found standing on the
mat, none other than that handsome young Mr. Brewer from the
warehouse. Whisky, cocktails, champagne, liqueurs and then Mr.
Senior's contribution to the mixture, had conspired to make him
entirely oblivious to his altered identity.</p>

<p>Amy gazed at the figure, for once in her life&mdash;short of
words. Tydvil accepted her silence as an olive branch. That was
why, a moment later, Amy Jones found herself in the arms of Mr.
Brewer, who fervently kissed the upturned face.</p>

<p>Amy struggled loose and gasped. "You ought to be ashamed of
yourself!"</p>

<p>Tydvil, still innocent of the enormity of his offence, smiled.
"Don't be angry with me, dear! Why should we quarrel?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Brewer! How&mdash;oh, how could you!"</p>

<p>Enlightenment crashed into Tydvil's mind. The flushed face
expressed more astonishment than anger. His mind registered the
fact automatically, but for the moment he knew he must carry
on.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I couldn't help it!" he stammered apologetically.</p>

<p>"I'm astonished, Mr. Brewer! Apart from anything else, what
would Mr. Jones think? He might be home at any moment."</p>

<p>"I left him working at the office." Tydvil suddenly recognised
that he had registered a water-tight alibi.</p>

<p>"But," Amy insisted, "how could you do such a thing as come
here like this."</p>

<p>"I was walking home, and felt ill&mdash;I did not think
really. I think it must have been a heart attack&mdash;I..."</p>

<p>She looked at him intently. She did not recognise that the
cigar in his hand hardly bore out the statement. "Would you like
me to ring for a doctor?" she asked.</p>

<p>Tydvil began to back out. "No, please, no," he said. "Please
forgive me&mdash;I feel better&mdash;I must go."</p>

<p>But Amy would not hear of it. "Wait, you must let me get you a
little stimulant&mdash;I insist."</p>

<p>Tydvil surrendered. He saw his way out. Amy led the way to the
reception room. "Now just sit down, Mr. Brewer. I won't be a
moment," and she bustled away.</p>

<p>The instant she disappeared, Tydvil whispered an urgent
"Nicholas! Nicholas!" In a moment Mr. Senior stood before
him.</p>

<p>"Get me out! Quick! Out into the street." Curtains parted, a
window opened and closed behind them. And Tydvil found himself in
St. Kilda Road.</p>

<p>"Whew!" he gasped breathlessly. Then, "Why on earth didn't you
remind me I hadn't changed over?"</p>

<p>Mr. Senior raised his brows. "My part, my dear fellow is not
advisory. You must remember. Still, there is no harm done, is
there?"</p>

<p>After a moment's reflection, Tydvil admitted that things might
be worse. The change from Billy to his rightful self was effected
in a moment.</p>

<p>"Sure you're all right, now?" asked Nicholas. "Absolutely,"
replied Mr. Jones emphatically, turning to his gate.</p>

<p>Again he walked swiftly up the drive, and let himself in with
his latch key to meet Amy in the wide hall carrying a tray on
which was a glass and a jug and the bottle of whisky that was
kept in the medicine cupboard for emergencies.</p>

<p>Amy's face expressed consternation rather than welcome. Tydvil
pretended not to notice her uneasiness. "Good gracious! Amy, what
are you doing with that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I felt ill! I was waiting up for you! I..."</p>

<p>"By Jove, you do look pale! Come into the sitting-room and I
will give you some of that." He made as though to take the tray
from her hands.</p>

<p>"No, no, Tydvil" Amy protested anxiously. "You must be tired.
Go up to your room. I will be quite all right."</p>

<p>But Tydvil insisted. He took the tray from her and, entering
the room, placed it on a table and turned towards her. Amy was
standing in the doorway looking round the room in utter
bewilderment.</p>

<p>Picking up the bottle and the tumbler, Tydvil paused and
sniffed. "That's strange!" Another sniff. "Do you know, Amy,"
sniff, "this room smells as though of cigar smoke." He looked at
her enquiringly.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Tydvil!" she said, advancing into the room. "You
must be dreaming. I cannot smell anything unusual."</p>

<p>He poured some whisky into the glass and, adding water, handed
it to her. "Of course I must be wrong," he admitted, "but I
really thought for a moment that there was an odour of tobacco.
Stupid, wasn't it? Now drink that at once."</p>

<p>Amy obeyed. For the first time in her life she felt she needed
a stimulant. "Now," he said, taking a glass from her, "you get
along to bed. I'll put these things away and put out the
lights."</p>

<p>She felt no inclination to argue. The situation was beyond
her. There was as much of relief as of bewilderment in her
mind.</p>

<p>As for Tydvil, he went about his tidying up cheerfully. But
when he reached his bedroom, he seated himself on the side of his
bed and lapsed into long but silent laughter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p>Next morning saw the phenomenon of Amy being first at the
breakfast table. She had decided on a truce, but her decision was
almost shattered when, looking over her paper, the paragraph that
Tydvil had dictated to Geraldine met her eyes. Amy, not only
boiled with wrath, she almost exploded. Fortunately, she had five
minutes in which to recover before a composed and impenitent
husband wished her a polite "good morning" as he took his
place.</p>

<p>Although Tydvil was not aware of the blessing, nature had
gifted him with one of those rare but priceless heads that do not
impose a drastic penance for a night out. He was feeling as fit
as he looked, and helped himself generously to grilled kidneys
and bacon.</p>

<p>Amy watched him sulkily, and then said sourly, "I think, my
dear Tydvil, you might have refrained from insulting me
publicly."</p>

<p>Waiting to swallow his first mouthful, Tydvil made no pretence
of misunderstanding. The paper beside her told its tale. He
shrugged his shoulders as he spiked another piece of kidney with
his fork. "You asked for it!" was all he said.</p>

<p>She was puzzled at his manner. This new Tydvil required study.
Evidently caution in handling him was demanded. Amy went on,
"However, I do not propose to discuss the matter now..."</p>

<p>"That's good!" interrupted Tydvil.</p>

<p>"But we will go into it at another time," Amy concluded
without noticing his interjection.</p>

<p>"Well, if you like rows so much as that, don't let me stop
you," he answered.</p>

<p>Amy declined the challenge. "I have some rather important news
for you," she announced.</p>

<p>"Shoot!" Tydvil was evidently far more interested in the
kidneys than Amy's news, and his indifference annoyed her.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of 'shoot'?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"It's a shorter word than proceed, and means the same thing.
'Shoot,'" he added, "is a synonym for 'get it off your
chest.'"</p>

<p>"One is vulgar, and the other is coarse, and both are
offensive," retorted Amy. "You know I detest slang."</p>

<p>"Quite so," said the imperturbable Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Then perhaps," she came back very, acidly, "you will
condescend to speak English to me."</p>

<p>Still deeply engaged with his plate, Tydvil said, very
politely, "Very well, my dear, I repeat, it will give me
unfeigned pleasure to hear your news."</p>

<p>Amy accepted the words at their face value. "I had a visit
yesterday from a most distinguished gentleman, a Mr. Nicholas
Senior, who is in Australia enquiring into our social work and
conditions."</p>

<p>"Ur!" came the non-commital comment from the kidneys. "I spent
the whole afternoon with him, inspecting our institutions."</p>

<p>"Ur!"</p>

<p>"He was most intensely interested."</p>

<p>"After subscriptions, I suppose," commented Tydvil.</p>

<p>"There you are entirely wrong. Indeed, he subscribed to ours
with most princely, generosity. It may interest you to know that
he gave a cheque for one hundred pounds for the Moral Uplift
Society."</p>

<p>"Mug!" murmured Tydvil.</p>

<p>"What did you say, Tydvil?" she demanded. "I said 'good,' my
dear."</p>

<p>She looked at his suspiciously a moment. "You cannot think why
he called on me." Amy purred.</p>

<p>"I was wondering," Tydvil admitted.</p>

<p>"Well, he had heard of my work from the Archbishop of
Canterbury, and he had a letter of introduction to me from dear
Archbishop Pottinger." There was exaltation in her voice.</p>

<p>Tydvil did not respond to the invitation for congratulations.
Instead, he reminded her that he had put himself to the
inconvenience of waiting for her in his office all the morning,
and that she had not come. He submitted his remark as a
justifiable grievance.</p>

<p>"I know," answered Amy, "but I really could not come, Mr.
Senior took me to lunch."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>Amy paused, and then said hesitantly, "Well, Tydvil, Mr.
Senior is staying at Menzies, and we went there."</p>

<p>Tydvil Jones put his knife and fork gently on his plate and
said in pained amazement, "Amy, have you forgotten that you are
one of the vice-presidents of the League for the Suppression of
Alcohol."</p>

<p>"That makes no difference whatever, Tydvil. If Mr. Senior can
stay there, and he is a friend of the Archbishop of Canterbury, I
don't think anyone could take exception to my lunching with
him."</p>

<p>"I am astonished, Amy! Astonished!" commented her husband with
virtuous censure.</p>

<p>"There was really nothing at all objectionable," she
protested. Then, hurriedly, to stop further argument, "I am
asking Mr. Senior to dinner, Tydvil. He is most anxious to meet
you."</p>

<p>Mr. Jones glanced at the clock and stood up. "I cannot help
feeling surprised and grieved at your indiscretion, Amy. Of
course, I will meet Mr. Senior. I feel quite justified in
acquainting him with my disapproval. Have my car sent round," he
directed the maid.</p>

<p>Somehow, Amy felt that Tydvil had forced her into a corner
from which she could protest neither against the strictures on
Mr. Senior nor his ordering the car.</p>

<p>Pausing at the door as he left the room, Tydvil announced that
he would be working late at the office again, and Amy made no
comment.</p>

<p>That morning, when, shortly before ten o'clock, Mr. William
Brewer presented himself at the St. Kilda court to answer a
charge of assault on a police officer and insulting behaviour, he
was the least happy and most bewildered man in the Metropolitan
area. He found that he had an unexpected capacity for a further
depression of spirits when, a minute or two later, no less a
person than Tydvil Jones appeared and took his place in front of
the bench. He was accompanied by a tall and very distinguished
looking companion of legal aspect.</p>

<p>"That has torn it," Billy reflected, though Tydvil apparently
took no notice of Mr. Brewer's presence.</p>

<p>Tydvil himself was interested to note that "among those
present" were Mr. Cranston and his two unpleasant looking
friends, the large policeman whom he had treated so promptly and
effectually the night before, and four young men who were, he
supposed, the rest of the hunting pack.</p>

<p>The police magistrate who presided on the bench, disposed of
three drunks in five minutes, and one minor assault case in less
than ten. Then the case of William Brewer&mdash;insulting
behaviour and assaulting a constable&mdash;was called.</p>

<p>Immediately Mr. Olden rose to his feet and announced that he
appeared for the defendant. Then he slipped across to the
astonished William who had taken his place in the dock, and
whispered he was not to worry, but not to give evidence on his
own behalf on any account.</p>

<p>Used as he was to hard swearing and the complication of police
court evidence, Mr. J. J. Arty, M.P., remembered the case of
William Brewer in after life as the most remarkable in a long
experience.</p>

<p>All the morning the legal battle raged round the defendant's
black eye. Mr. Olden nailed the witnesses for the prosecution
down to that eye. The large constable swore positively that,
black or no black eye, it was the defendant who had hurled half a
brick at his outraged person. He was warmly supported by Mr.
Cranston and his two unpleasant friends, who all told a tale of
infuriated intoxication, murderous assault with a kerosene lamp,
and outrageous language, but all agreed that the defendant had no
black eye. They had all witnessed the assault on the constable in
the execution of his duty. The four young men were weak in detail
but strong in their belief.</p>

<p>One the contrary, two indignant friends of Billy, and the wife
of one of them, swore just as positively that the defendant had
spent the evening playing cards at their home and that the black
eye was properly ripe when he had arrived at their home.</p>

<p>Mr. Arty began to lose patience and remarked that he had
listened to more perjury that morning than he was accustomed to
hear in six months of police court practice, and that was a great
deal. Then Mr. Olden called Mr. Tydvil Jones, who entered the
witness box and bowed politely to Mr. Arty, to whom he was very
well known.</p>

<p>Sworn, Mr. Jones deposed that he was entirely at a loss to
understand the evidence he had heard from either side. The
defendant was in his employ. On the previous evening Brewer had
worked back with him at his office until somewhere near eleven
p.m. He was not sure of the exact time Mr. Brewer left him, but
he could not possibly have been embroiled with the police or
Cranston, neither was it possible he could have played cards with
his friends&mdash;as alleged.</p>

<p>He was also positive that the black eye, round which the case
centred, was obtained by the defendant on the previous morning
while he was assisting his (Mr. Tydvil Jones') secretary with her
work. He had been present when the accident occurred. He felt
sure that Brewer would not have been able to reach St. Kilda by
the time the assault was alleged to have taken place.</p>

<p>Mr. Arty questioned Mr. Jones closely, and received instant
and frank replies to all the questions which he put to the
witness.</p>

<p>Mr. Arty then sat back in his char and told all the witnesses
except Mr. Tydvil Jones, whose high standing and well known
integrity placed him above suspicion, that for some reason best
known to themselves they had come into court and sworn to what he
regarded as a "fabric of unmitigated falsehood." He could form no
idea of the reason for the evidence they had given, but there was
evidently something behind the case that had not been
disclosed.</p>

<p>He concluded by telling the witnesses that if he could make up
his mind which were the liars, he would gladly commit them for
perjury. Then he discharged William Brewer as the victim of a
manifest conspiracy.</p>

<p>Ten of the witnesses and Billy Brewer left the court in
bemazed indignation. Pausing to tell Brewer to see him in his
office as soon as he arrived at the warehouse, he rejoined Mr.
Olden and the two, entering Tydvil's car, drove off
citywards.</p>

<p>For the first five minutes Tydvil was silent and very
thoughtful. His reverie was interrupted by Nicholas. "That, my
dear Tydvil," he said with a smile, "is where you draw your
dividends on your blameless past."</p>

<p>"Hump!" Tydvil growled. "You were right when you said how easy
it was to get into mischief. Still, I had to give that
evidence."</p>

<p>"I don't know that it was imperative," commented Mr. Senior,
"but you made a great job of it."</p>

<p>"It was necessary," replied Tydvil. "You see, I told my wife
last night Brewer had been working back with me." He outlined his
encounter with Amy and added, "So, you see, I had to back in the
witness box what I had told her."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see," commented Nicholas. "But it just proves that a
man with a first class reputation can get away with practically
anything. Every one of those ten witnesses told the truth as he
saw it. But the whole mass of their evidence was blown out by
your wholly fictitious statements."</p>

<p>Arranging to meet in his office that evening, the two parted
when Tydvil dropped Nicholas on Princes Bridge.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes after Tydvil had arrived at his office, Brewer
knocked and was admitted. Billy, angry and bewildered, was glad
that Geraldine was not at her table when he passed it.</p>

<p>His reception by Tydvil was somewhat cold, but not hostile.
Said Tydvil, "I will not enquire into the unfortunate
circumstances which led you into the unpleasant position in which
I found you this morning. I accepted unreservedly the assurance
of my friend, Mr. Olden, that you were guiltless, and was very
glad to be able to do so. I am afraid I adopted a most
reprehensible course in giving the evidence I did..."</p>

<p>Billy made as though to speak.</p>

<p>"No, Brewer, there is no need to thank me. It would have been
a miscarriage of justice had the bench believed the evidence
against you. We'll say no more about it." Tydvil smiled and held
out his hand.</p>

<p>Billy took it warmly and stuttered his gratitude. As he turned
to go, Tydvil stopped him. "Oh, by the way, Brewer, this business
of this morning almost made me forget. Do you know a man named
Jerry McCann?"</p>

<p>Startled, and wondering what more was in store, Billy admitted
the acquaintanceship.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Tydvil, "last night about ten o'clock, when I
was working here, I heard a hammering on the front door of the
warehouse. I opened it, and there was a man on the doorstep who
gave the name of Jerry McCann..."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" gasped Billy.</p>

<p>"Not at all," continued Tydvil. "He was, I am afraid, somewhat
under the influence of liquor..."</p>

<p>"But..." Billy tried to break in.</p>

<p>"Wait, wait!" Tydvil silenced him. "He wanted to see you. He
was a little troublesome, so I humoured him. He said he owed you
some money and he had promised to pay you last night&mdash;dead
or alive&mdash;that was the exact term he used. So I agreed to
take charge of the money for you. Here it is," and Tydvil held
out the twenty-five pounds.</p>

<p>While he was speaking, Billy stared at Tyddie with something
like awe on his face. He looked at the money, scarcely daring to
touch it. "Are you sure it was ten o'clock, sir?" he almost
whispered.</p>

<p>"Quite," responded Jones. "I remember the time and the words
most distinctly. Why?"</p>

<p>"Jerry McCann was killed by a motor car just before eight
o'clock, in Swanston Street. All the papers have it this
morning."</p>

<p>Tydvil Jones had no need to act the astonishment and shock
that he felt from the announcement, though they arose from causes
other than Billy Brewer supposed. "Impossible! I..." He stopped
and stared, too, at the money in his hand.</p>

<p>"Amazing!" muttered Billy. "He actually said, 'dead or
alive'?"</p>

<p>"Beyond a doubt," said Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Do you think...?" Billy paused, staring at Jones.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "I don't know what to think, Brewer," he
said. "Best take this and say nothing about it. He owed it to
you, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Billy nodded, taking the notes. "Yes, and that is what he said
to me last week&mdash;'Dead or alive'!"</p>

<p>Slowly, and with bent head, Billy walked down the warehouse
towards the main entrance. He felt a drink was essential to his
sanity. As he reached a huge stack of Manchester goods at the
foot of the staircase, he almost ran into Amy in his abstraction.
Starting, he raised his hat respectfully. But Amy paused and
shook a gloved finger at him playfully. "Oh, Mr. Brewer!" she
smiled. "I'm afraid you are very, very naughty. You quite
frightened me last night." She passed on, still smiling.</p>

<p>Unseen by either, Miss Geraldine Brand, who was coming down
the steps, had seen and heard the encounter. Billy, wondering if
he had heard aright, or if he were mad, stood with his lips
apart, not seeing Geraldine until that young woman made him aware
of her haughty presence by saying, "So! It is not only Hilda
Cranston, but Mrs. Jones!"</p>

<p>Billy came to earth from the clouds that enveloped him, "What
were you saying, Geraldine?" He strove to pull himself
together.</p>

<p>"I heard what Mrs. Jones said about your frightening her last
night. I suppose you'll say I didn't!"</p>

<p>He waved his hands feebly. I don't know what she was talking
about..."</p>

<p>"And," she went on with steam-roller scorn, "I suppose you
were not talking to Hilda Cranston outside His Majesty's Theatre
last night just after eight o'clock."</p>

<p>"Geraldine!" he protested. "I swear I haven't spoken to Hilda
Cranston for nearly three months. I told you I had cut out that
sort of thing."</p>

<p>"I prefer," she shot at him, "to believe the evidence of my
own eyes. I saw you&mdash;you...!" Words failed Geraldine, and
she swept past him.</p>

<p>But Billy's cup was not yet full, though it overflowed ten
minutes later in the Carillion bar when he offered the blonde
Connie eleven pounds in notes.</p>

<p>"Don't act the goat, Billy!" she laughed, pushing the money
aside.</p>

<p>"But King Rufus won!" he insisted.</p>

<p>"Look here, Billy!" the girl said seriously. "Judging from
that lovely eye you have, you must have had a fair load on last
night, but you were quite sober when you paid over that money to
me; you couldn't have forgotten it."</p>

<p>"I was here last night, and paid you?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"And without this eye?" He indicated the dark purple
decoration.</p>

<p>Again she nodded. "Here, quit fooling and put this down your
neck." She pushed a whisky and soda across to him. "You must need
a reviver."</p>

<p>Billy shook his head and pushed it back again. "Not me,
Connie! Not me!" he muttered. "I'm on the water-waggon for the
rest of my life." He turned and almost tottered into Elizabeth
Street. Life was too much for him, he felt.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p>But Billy Brewer was not the only, one to whom the day brought
problems. When Geraldine Brand's were presented to her, they came
from her evening paper which she read on the way home. No king
had died. No murder had been committed. No political crisis had
occurred. Space was plentiful, and news had been dull until the
story sent in by a district correspondent from the St. Kilda
court had gladdened a news editor's heart. It went on to the
front page, headed "Black Eye Comedy," and the story, with an
almost verbatim report of the evidence, lost nothing in the
telling.</p>

<p>Geraldine read that damning story of the alleged activities of
one, William Brewer, on the previous night, with ever-increasing
indignation. But her indignation was levelled not at the culprit,
so much as at his detractors. She was a wise, competent and
level-headed young woman. She read and re-read the evidence, and
more especially the evidence which touched on the decoration she
had bestowed on Billy, until she almost committed it to memory.
And Geraldine thought and thought all that evening. Long after
she had retired for the night, she lay awake trying to make sense
of what she had read and that which she knew, herself, to be
true. But none of it made sense.</p>

<p>It was only when she was reading the story, that there flashed
into her mind inexplicable truth that she had overlooked in her
anger against Billy on the previous evening. The Billy who had
been talking to Hilda Cranston outside of His Majesty's Theatre
had not a black eye! Of that she was now certain. Yet, both she,
and apparently that Cranston woman, had accepted him unreservedly
as Billy. So, according to his evidence, had Cranston, who, as
Geraldine virtuously reflected, deserved that sort of wife.</p>

<p>It was difficult enough to accept the suggestion that that
Billy was not her Billy&mdash;she had unaccountably, found
herself thinking of him as her Billy, and liked the idea
immensely. But there was something else, known only to herself.
The evidence of Mr. Tydvil Jones was almost more astounding than
the problem of two Billies.</p>

<p>She, Geraldine Brand, was prepared to swear and take oath
that, despite his sworn evidence in the St. Kilda court that day,
Tydvil Jones had not worked back at the office on the previous
night. Therefore, it followed logically that the Tyddie she
believed to rank among the most virtuous of men had gone into the
witness box and had sworn deliberately to some most tremendous
fibs&mdash;whoppers! Somehow she liked him better for the
knowledge, especially so as the fibs had cleared&mdash;more or
less&mdash;Billy's character.</p>

<p>Of one thing she felt sure, and only one. Billy, where ever he
may have been that night, was innocent of wrong doing. She
reasoned that somehow Tyddie was sure of Billy's innocence. Had
he not been, he would most certainly have sacked him. It seemed
inconsistent that Tyddie would commit perjury himself and execute
Billy for a lesser offence, but she felt she was right.</p>

<p>But then, how did Amy come into the picture? Geraldine had
seen her shake her finger at Billy and had heard every syllable
of that slightly gay reprimand. She remembered Billy's&mdash;her
Billy's&mdash;utter astonishment and consternation at the time.
Evidently, she concluded, Amy had been barking up the wrong Billy
and did not know it. The activities of the false Billy must have
been as prodigious as they were incomprehensible. They certainly
reflected adversely on his taste in feminine friends.</p>

<p>Then there was that perplexing and flagrant perjurer, her
employer. What had he been up to?' Here, Geraldine's usually
clear, incisive mind refused to reason. Had it been any other
man, Geraldine would have jumped to the only reasonable
conclusion, that he had been running wild.</p>

<p>Geraldine knew as much of Tydvil's business as he knew
himself, and she was positive that there was nothing that could
have kept him back at the office on the previous
evening&mdash;not business, anyway. Could Tyddie...? No,
impossible! Her mind refused to put such a thought into form.
Geraldine stopped the vigorous brushing of her hair and stared at
herself for a long time in the mirror, but she did not see
herself. Her abstraction made her miss a charming picture.</p>

<p>Much later that night, before she slept, Geraldine made two
resolutions. One was, that Billy Brewer needed a woman,
preferably, much preferably, herself, to look after him and keep
him out of mischief. The other was, that in the very near future
she would be very much less hostile in her manner to Billy, and
further, that having won his confidence he would be called upon
to answer a lot of questions&mdash;quite a lot of questions. But
her last and dominant thought was one that would have compensated
Billy for all his trials had he but known of it.</p>

<p>Amy, also, had read of the "Black Eye Comedy." The unexpected
appearance of Mr. Brewer and his still more unexpected
disappearance, had caused her a great deal of very mixed emotion.
That kiss! Amy was not quite sure whether she was more angry with
herself or Mr. Brewer. Yes, Mr. Brewer, who had no black eye. She
read Tydvil's testimony to the effect that his Mr. Brewer did
have a black eye. Yet her Mr. Brewer, whose eyes were both normal
and both bold, had told her he had been working back in the
office with Tydvil.</p>

<p>Knowing least of anyone of the events of the previous night,
Amy could only decide that it was all very, peculiar. It was more
peculiar that Tydvil had not mentioned the matter at breakfast
that morning. She felt an urgent need for enlightenment, but felt
more urgently still that such investigation as she embarked on
through Tydvil would require much circumspection and
diplomacy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the joint causes of all these perplexities were
comfortably in conference in the office of Tydvil Jones. Tydvil
had indulged in a very good dinner, it would have been better, he
thought, if he had had the courage to order a small bottle of
wine&mdash;but he was still Tydvil Jones. But the cigar he was
now smoking compensated to some extent for the omission.</p>

<p>Nicholas had listened in amused silence to Tydvil's account of
the final episodes, in his own home, of the previous night's
excursion. Said he, when the tale was told, "Does it occur to
you, Tydvil, that Brewer's black eye has become the pivotal point
for some difficult explanations?"</p>

<p>Disregarding the question for the moment, Tydvil, from the
depths of his chair, chuckled happily. "It was a most successful
night for a beginner." Then, thoughtfully, "I'm afraid, Nicholas,
I shall have to abandon adopting a known individuality for a
creation of my own."</p>

<p>Said Nicholas dryly, "If Brewer were fully informed on the
matter, I should say he would be among the first to applaud your
decision."</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Tydvil, "it never occurred to me that I would
put him into such a hole. By all the laws of decency, I am bound
to help him out."</p>

<p>"He is going to need help, too," responded Nicholas. "The
husband of your lively young friend of last night spent this
afternoon arranging for a divorce with Brewer as the contributing
factor."</p>

<p>Tydvil sat erect. "Great Scot!" he groaned. "I never thought
of that, either; what on earth can we do?"</p>

<p>Nicholas shrugged his shoulders. "The least of your troubles,
I think. If a judge in divorce can make anything out of the same
evidence as was given at St. Kilda this morning, he will be a
very astute man. No," he went on, "your immediate problem comes
from a different source."</p>

<p>Tydvil stared an interrogation.</p>

<p>"I've been keeping an eye on that secretary of yours. You
should know better than I that that girl is no fool."</p>

<p>"Hump, and what then?" Tydvil asked curiously. "Have you seen
the evening papers?"</p>

<p>Tydvil shook his head.</p>

<p>"Well," Nicholas smiled, "there is a full and fairly accurate
account of the court proceeding in them."</p>

<p>"Still, I don't see..." Tydvil began.</p>

<p>"Two things," Mr. Senior interrupted. "First, she has just
discovered she is really in love with Brewer. Second, she has
read the papers and at this moment she is trying to reconcile
your evidence with the fact known to her that you most certainly
did not work back in the office last night."</p>

<p>"Holy Moses!" Tydvil interjected. "Of course, she would know
that from my table."</p>

<p>"And," continued Nicholas, "she is this moment trying to work
out a solution of the black eye problem&mdash;and so is your
wife!"</p>

<p>Tydvil ran his hand through his hair. "Two of 'em!" Then
amusement got the better of his anxiety, and he laughed
heartily.</p>

<p>"Exactly," nodded Mr. Senior. "Two of 'em! And that is why I
said just now that Brewer's eye was a pivotal point for some
explanation."</p>

<p>"Anyway," Tydvil said, "they can't do much more than wonder,
and they can wonder as much as they like."</p>

<p>"Um," Nicholas replied. "They're wondering all right. In the
circumstances, your wife is a bit handicapped because her
explanation would be rather more difficult than yours."</p>

<p>Here Tydvil again sat erect, staring in front of him. Then his
eyes brightened and a smile of happiness spread over his
face.</p>

<p>Watching him intently, Nicholas lay back and laughed softly.
"Tydvil," he said, "I'm no moralist, but would that be wise?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Tydvil, surprised at the
question.</p>

<p>"I read your thought. Forgive the intrusion, it was only a
natural curiosity."</p>

<p>"Well," answered Tydvil defensively, "Amy owes me a good deal,
and..."</p>

<p>"I see," Senior grinned. "If anyone is going to alienate your
wife's affections, you would rather do it yourself&mdash;and know
exactly what is going on."</p>

<p>"Ethically..." began Tydvil.</p>

<p>Again Nicholas laughed heartily, waving his hand. "No, no,
please, no, Tydvil! No ethics!"</p>

<p>"All right," Tydvil conceded, "no ethics. But if I bring a new
interest into Amy's life, it might keep her out of mischief."</p>

<p>"Oh, please yourself!" Nicholas said. "I admit the idea
appeals to me as something new for both of you. A good deal
depends on what you mean by 'mischief.'"</p>

<p>"Look here!" demanded Tydvil virtuously. "If a man cannot make
love to his own wife, whose wife can he make love to?"</p>

<p>"Better, I suppose, than becoming involved with Mr.
Cranston's," Senior admitted. "However, have it your own
way."</p>

<p>"My plan's worth considering. It has the virtue of novelty,"
said Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Well, if you can reconcile it with any form of virtue, don't
let me interfere. But, remember this," Nicholas added, "that will
not dispose of your secretary."</p>

<p>"If Brewer were not such a good chap, I might dispose of her
in the same way,' Tydvil suggested.</p>

<p>"Quite a good idea!" laughed Nicholas. "Considering your
upbringing, Tydvil, your capacity for very original sin amazes
even me."</p>

<p>"Ah, well," Tydvil said, a little regretfully, "Brewer
deserves better treatment. I owe it to him, anyway. I'm afraid
that Geraldine Brand is beginning to think that I am not quite
the pattern of virtue she imagined me to be."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" Nicholas agreed. "That is a very, unusual young
woman, Tydvil. She has brains, and knows how to use them. And if
you don't watch your step, my friend&mdash;well, 'ware red
hair."</p>

<p>"Still, I don't see that she could do much," contended
Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Don't under-rate her," warned Nicholas. "That girl has got
hold of one fact&mdash;that you were not telling the truth in the
witness box&mdash;and several suppositions. Now, give a red-
headed girl, who is in love and defending her lover, that much to
work on and you, or I, may be astonished at the things she can
do. Believe me, Tydvil, I speak from a long experience. A
brunette on the warpath is bad enough&mdash;but the red-heads! My
boy, a sack full of wild cats would be more tractable."</p>

<p>Tydvil looked thoughtful. "Suppose," he asked, "we gave her
Billy Brewer free of encumbrance, so to speak?"</p>

<p>"Professionally," replied Mr. Senior, "it would be against my
interests. Brewer is heavily mortgaged to me. If that girl gets
hold of him, he'll pay off the mortgage in the first year he's
married. You can't beat red-heads either as reformers or the
reverse when they set about it. Still, in the circumstances, I
would be willing to waive my claim."</p>

<p>"They say marriages are made in heaven," remarked Tydvil
reflectively.</p>

<p>Mr. Senior grinned derisively. "That one was started by a
bachelor. If Brewer marries your Geraldine Brand, and does not
behave himself afterwards, you'll find it difficult to persuade
him that his marriage was made in heaven."</p>

<p>"Well," said Tydvil, "that's his risk."</p>

<p>"Oh! Talking of Heaven, that reminds me that I am to have the
pleasure of dining at your home tomorrow evening&mdash;to meet
Mr. Jones and a few of our leading social workers."</p>

<p>"You have my deepest sympathy," Tydvil replied, lighting
another cigar.</p>

<p>"Really, I am looking forward to it," Nicholas assured
him.</p>

<p>"Well, don't let me discourage you, but I happen to have seen
the list of guests, and an innate sense of hospitality makes me
feel rather guilty."</p>

<p>"You need not worry, for I feel sure it will be an enjoyable
evening."</p>

<p>Tydvil smiled through the smoke. "If I hear you say that
afterwards, I shall feel greatly relieved."</p>

<p>"And now, what about your own affairs?" asked Nicholas.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking it over," Tydvil replied, "and recognise
that we cannot risk a known individuality. Can you turn me out as
something new?"</p>

<p>"No difficulty whatever," Nicholas assured him. "Just what
would you like to be?"</p>

<p>"Oh, say something fairly good looking and robust. Plenty of
self-assurance. Not exactly entirely a sporting man, but a good
all-round type. Oh, and able to use my hands if necessary!"</p>

<p>"Attractive to women," Nicholas suggested.</p>

<p>Tydvil hesitated a moment. "Well, yes, but within reasonable
limits. I suppose that is one highroad to adventure."</p>

<p>"One of the best," Mr. Senior conceded. "Status? I can put you
into the Metropolitan or the Continental Club if you like."</p>

<p>Tydvil shook his head. "No, I think not," he said. "I'm afraid
they would cramp my style&mdash;make it something prosperous, but
not too conspicuous."</p>

<p>Mr. Senior stood up and looked Tydvil over with speculative
eyes for a few moments. Then, after a wave of his hands, "Now
look at yourself..."</p>

<p>Tydvil rose to his feet and approached the mirror. Looking
back at him was an attractive stranger, about two inches taller
than Tydvil Jones, and broader. Under the sleek, black hair was a
shapely, square-chinned face. The grey eyes above a slightly
aquiline nose, had a merry twinkle, and the rather large, but
well-shaped mouth, had a smile an either corner. Tydvil felt
quite pleased with himself.</p>

<p>The smile broke into a laugh as he turned to Nicholas.
"Ideal!" he thanked his friend. "The remodelled Tydvil Jones is
proud of himself..."</p>

<p>"Better give him a remodelled name," Nicholas suggested.</p>

<p>Tydvil picked up the telephone directory from his table and
opened it at random. Running his finger down the page, he looked
up. "More than a page of Williams," he said. "A nice non-
committal name. We'll make it&mdash;let me
think&mdash;Bertie&mdash;Bernard&mdash;no--say, Basil. Yes,
permit me to introduce myself&mdash;Basil Williams."</p>

<p>Mr. Senior took the outstretched hand. "I trust, Mr. Williams,
you will have a pleasant evening."</p>

<p>"Too right I will!" grinned Basil Williams. Then his smile
disappeared. "Oh, dash it all, I forgot!"</p>

<p>Nicholas raised an enquiring eyebrow.</p>

<p>"Amy," explained Tydvil. "She came in this morning to tell me
about our dinner tomorrow night, and I promised I should be at
home this evening. I wouldn't put it past her coming to look for
me if I didn't show up."</p>

<p>Then his face brightened. "Nicholas, could you act as a deputy
Tydvil Jones. It's rather tough on you&mdash;but..."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, my bond apart, it will be a pleasure." Mr.
Senior spoke sincerely.</p>

<p>"Well, all I can say it," said Basil Williams with deep
feeling, "that your conceptions of pleasure are peculiar. Amy has
something on her mind&mdash;that Brewer affair I
expect&mdash;anyhow, I assure you that you will know all about it
before the night is over."</p>

<p>"How is this?" asked Nicholas, and as he spoke a replica of
Tydvil Jones stood where Mr. Senior had stood.</p>

<p>Tydvil inspected his deputy, carefully, and admitted he was
perfect. "A word of advice and help," he said. "When she makes
the going too hot for me, I always make for my own bedroom and
lock the door. You may need sanctuary before the night is
over."</p>

<p>Nicholas&mdash;Tydvil smiled a superior smile. "My friend. In
adopting your identity I retain the powers of endurance belonging
to my office. Your solicitude is pleasant, but quite
unnecessary."</p>

<p>"Maybe," Basil Williams replied. "But I know Amy, and you
don't." Then, remembering, "About my change back to Tydvil?"</p>

<p>"Leave it entirely, to me. Just call when you need me, and I
will arrange everything."</p>

<p>"Well, I think that is all," Tydvil said, helping himself to
the contents of his cash box.</p>

<p>Nicholas bade him good luck and good fun, and disappeared
about his business in hand. Basil Williams, taking a hat from its
peg, sallied out into the city, light of heart and full of
hope.</p>

<a name="ch21"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p>When Nicholas let himself into the Jones mansion on St. Kilda
Road with the assistance of Tydvil's latch key, Amy, who had kept
dinner back for three-quarters of an hour, was just leaving the
dining-room. As she saw him enter, she glanced at the dial of the
Spanish mahogany grandfather clock that stood in the wide hall.
Its hands showed that the time was twenty-five minutes to nine
o'clock.</p>

<p>She opened fire as the sights came on. "This is a nice time to
come home, Tydvil, I must say! Especially as you promised me
faithfully you would be back to dinner."</p>

<p>Nicholas had placed his coat and hat on a high, carved
chair&mdash; a Restoration piece. "Are you doing that to provoke
me deliberately, Tydvil?" she asked acidly. "Ellen, remove those
things!" She pointed to the outraged chair, and glared at the
maid who was passing. So had Oliver Cromwell spoken when he
ordered the removal of the Mace from the table of the
Commons.</p>

<p>"Now," as she followed her supposed husband into the room
nominally reserved for his own use, "perhaps you can explain" Her
voice was that which she kept for domestic use only.</p>

<p>Mr. Senior, as Jones, spoke conciliatingly. "You know I have
been busy&mdash;very busy. I left work I should have done, and
came as soon as I possibly, could."</p>

<p>"Apparently, my dear Tydvil, you consider your work far more
important than your wife. Her interests are not worth your
consideration. Here I am, all day, labouring for your comfort,
and this is all the thanks I get."</p>

<p>"Amy," said Mr. Senior a little tartly, "I do not interfere
with your domestic arrangements. You must leave me to judge the
necessities of my office work."</p>

<p>And that&mdash;to use an expressive colloquialism&mdash;tore
it completely.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you don't interfere with my domestic arrangements?"
She almost gasped at the enormity. "You keep dinner waiting,
spoil my meal, and upset the whole house routine&mdash;and you
say you don't..." She paused for breath. "I was going to say I
was astonished. I am not! It is just what I might have expected
from your scandalous conduct lately. You swear at me before my
servants, insult me publicly in the newspapers. Perhaps you'll
strike me next."</p>

<p>Had Mr. Senior not been a gentleman by birth and instinct, the
suggestion might have come into effect at that moment. Mr. Senior
felt that Amy might be a much better woman and wife for a good
sock on the jaw. He recognised, however, that, his instincts
apart, he could not commit Tydvil to corrective treatment of Amy.
He began to feel a great respect and a greater sympathy for his
friend.</p>

<p>However, Amy had not paused for one second. "Talk about your
being judge of the necessities of your office! You, with your
name spread all over the paper in connection with some disgusting
brawl in the street last night. It seems to me that office of
yours houses some queer people. Nice thing for me! What will our
friends think? That man Brewer and his black eye and disgraceful
associates! Will you be good enough to tell me why you did not
mention that revolting business at breakfast this morning,
instead of leaving me to find out from the newspapers?"</p>

<p>Nicholas paused to gather his thoughts before replying. "Ump!"
Amy snorted. "Sulking again, or are you ashamed to speak? You
should be!"</p>

<p>Hoping amiability might still the tempest, Nicholas said
gently, "My dear, I am sorry I could not mention the matter this
morning, because I heard nothing of Brewer's difficulties until I
reached the office."</p>

<p>"You knew it when I saw you at the office afterwards," she
retorted. "Yes, and that is another thing. That dinner tomorrow
night! What will Mr. Senior think of us? And I was so anxious to
create a good impression. You had no right to go to that court
and involve yourself in such a loathsome affair&mdash;that
Cranston woman should be flogged; but you rush in, without
thinking of me, and become associated with such a creature."</p>

<p>"But," Mr. Senior put in desperately, "knowing Brewer was
innocent, because he was with me all the evening, I had to
go."</p>

<p>"Had to go! Is this Brewer man more important than your wife's
peace of mind? If he gets himself into brawls he should get
himself out of them. I suppose you sympathise with men of that
type. Mr. Tydvil Jones and mixed up with a gang of the most
disreputable people in the city&mdash;a gang that the magistrate
said were the worst and most unprincipled liars he had ever
encountered."</p>

<p>Mr. Senior began to feel that self-restraint was almost an
heroic virtue with Amy as a domestic companion.</p>

<p>"Yes," she went on, unrelenting, "and I feel there is
something behind that affair. Did that man actually have the
black eye when he was working with you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Senior rose to the occasion, and most emphatically
asserted that he had. "Besides," he added, "Mr. Arty was in the
best position to judge from the evidence, and he accepted my
evidence as conclusive."</p>

<p>"I notice," Amy came back acidly, "that seven people swore
that he had not. Perhaps Mr. Arty does not know you as well as I
do."</p>

<p>Nicholas tried a stopper. "Anyone would think from what you
say, that you knew he had not a black eye," and he looked
straight into Amy's as he spoke.</p>

<p>Amy back-pedalled rapidly. "There is no need to be offensive,
Tydvil, dear," she said. "Since the subject is so distasteful to
me, I will say no more about it. What I really wished to discuss
with you is that really, abominable letter of yours to the
papers."</p>

<p>"What of it?" demanded Mr. Senior, a trifle truculently.</p>

<p>"You will be good enough, Tydvil dear, not to adopt that very
vulgar tone towards me. I am not one of your police court
associates. Kindly remember that, though from your behaviour
since yesterday morning, you make me think you would feel more at
home with people of that kind than in a decent, Christian home. I
think, Tydvil dear, that it is time we settled this question
about the Moral Uplift Society&mdash;definitely."</p>

<p>Mr. Senior took his cue from Tydvil's settled policy. "The
matter is settled," he announced uncompromisingly.</p>

<p>"A matter in which you have chosen to brand me publicly as
having told a falsehood, is not settled so simply," Amy bit
back.</p>

<p>"Well, didn't you?" It was not a tactful retort, and Mr.
Senior had cause to regret it.</p>

<p>"I admit I was foolish enough to trust in my husband's honour
to support me in the public work to which I have devoted my life.
I believed in your decency, and your charity and your public
spirit&mdash;and you betrayed my trust and confidence. You have
held me up to ridicule. There is only one way out, Tydvil,
dear,"&mdash;and there was frozen vitriol in that "Tydvil,
dear"&mdash;"to rehabilitate me in my own self-respect and in the
eyes of my friends. You must pay that thousand pounds I promised
in your name."</p>

<p>"I'll see you in Jericho first!" was Mr. Senior's warm
response. He stood up, remembering Tydvil's advice to make for
sanctuary, he thought the time had arrived at which to put it
into practice.</p>

<p>But Amy beat him to it. Experience had improved her strategy.
Instead of his locking the door of Tydvil's bedroom, Amy was
inside&mdash;a dead-heat&mdash;and secured the key before he
could reach for it. Mr. Senior found himself locked up with Amy's
voice and without any possibility of escape in his guise as
Tydvil Jones.</p>

<p>Amy occupied the only chair. Mr. Senior sat on the edge of the
bed, a situation that did not add to his dignity. Amy talked.</p>

<p>For nearly two hours that soul-scouring flood of eloquence
swept over him. He felt as though his nerves and spirit were
being scarified with a nutmeg grater. Slowly, the proud spirit of
Mr. Senior wilted. He who ruled his own Empire unchallenged felt
himself incompetent to cope with this relentless flood of bitter,
biting verbiage. Every attempt at reprisal became more feeble and
more hopeless. Amy felt round deftly for the weak places in his
armour, and emplanted poisoned darts. She passed the years of her
married life with Tydvil Jones in review&mdash;it was a pageant
of her own sufferings gallantly hidden, and of Tydvil's
contemptible shortcomings. She pleaded and twisted on his raw
nerves alternately. In those hours Mr. Senior learned something
in the gentle art of scientific torture that had hitherto been
beyond his imaginings. With a mind centred almost entirely on his
own torments, Mr. Senior marvelled vaguely how Tydvil could have
stuck it out for years.</p>

<p>At last the strain broke even Mr. Senior's iron will. Once
more they stood in Tydvil's den. Mr. Senior tore a cheque he had
filled in for one thousand pounds from the book and handed it to
her.</p>

<p>Amy folded it carefully. "I cannot thank you for this,
Tydvil," she said coldly. "It was nothing but your duty to give
it to me. I can only hope you can feel regret for your own
behaviour. I cannot hope that you will regret the pain you have
caused me. This discussion we have had has upset me terribly. A
man such as you cannot understand how heartbreaking it is for a
woman who has to plead, as I have had to plead, for simple
justice. I feel I must go to bed&mdash;not that I will sleep, my
tears will keep me awake. Goodnight, Tydvil dear."</p>

<p>Mr. Senior looked after her, a sore stricken man. Presently he
stood up and returned with bowed head to Tydvil's bedroom,
awaiting his summons. There, again on the edge of the bed, he sat
with his face in his hands. His thoughts were bitter because he
felt he had betrayed a friend. How could he face Tydvil with the
story of his defeat?</p>

<p>When at length the call of Basil Williams for Mr. Senior's aid
came, it came with a note of desperate urgency that spurred Mr.
Senior into flashing action. He had divested himself of his
likeness to Tydvil and disappeared in a fraction of a second. By
his own means, in another fraction of a second he was in
Exhibition Street, looking down unseen on as willing a street
riot in which any seeker after joyous adventure could wish to
participate.</p>

<p>Nicholas's swift survey showed him some sixty citizens, nearly
half of whom were women, who were engaged in ardent but
apparently aimless combat. Those not entwined with their fellows
were mixing it eagerly with some half a dozen policemen, who were
scattered through the crowd, and who were trying, with some
success, to use their batons on everyone not wearing uniform.
Approximately in the middle of the event, which spread from kerb
to kerb and overflowed on the footpaths, was a knot of six
policemen who were more busy than any of the other members of the
force. The language that arose from the spectacle was worthy of
the occasion.</p>

<p>As Nicholas took in the situation, two of the close knot of
police were shot from the bunch by some unseen force. Where they
fell they lay. The diversion showed Mr. Senior that the nucleus
of the excitement was none other than Mr. Basil Williams.
Although the remaining four members of the force afterwards
discussed long and earnestly what happened next, they were never
able to arrive at any definite conclusion. At one moment the four
were endeavouring to slip the bracelets on fourteen stone of
human wild cat, and the next he had gone from their midst as
though he had evaporated. Were it not for torn uniforms, abraded
skins and sundry bruises, they might have persuaded themselves
that they had imagined the fight.</p>

<p>All that was tangible of their assailant was a hat. One of
them pushed it under his tunic and the rest turned to deal with
the other combatants. It was not until fourteen of the rioters
had been booked at Russell Street that the hat was remembered.
The sergeant in charge examined the grey felt hat outside and
then inside. "Cripes!" he cried in astonishment. "This lid
belongs to Tydvil Jones the Flinders Lane wowser!" It says much
for Tydvil's public reputation that the discovery, gave rise to
no other comment than an exchange of ribald jokes on the
possibility of his being concerned in the proceedings in
Exhibition Street. Suspicion of his participation there was
none.</p>

<p>The sergeant in charge listened to the discussion on the
escaped prisoner with official wrath. "Six of you," he growled,
"and you let him make a get-away. Cripes, what's this? A police
force or a blinkin' boarding house for maiden ladies? Any of you
seen him before?"</p>

<p>There was no reply, and he went on, "I suppose it is too much
to hope that any, genius among you would know him again."</p>

<p>Six feet three inches of indignant muscle in uniform, who,
with one foot on a chair was tenderly examining a blue and
swollen shin, looked over his shoulder and said, "I'd pick that
blighter out of an army corps, and if I come across him again,
I'll..."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," broke in the sergeant savagely, "you'd chew him
up and spit out the bones. Well, this lid's been pinched from
Jones," he tossed the hat across the room, "take it down to his
warehouse in the morning and enquire if he knows anyone answering
the description." Then, looking coldly over the others, he went
on. "If you're not all too weary you might get on the job again.
Oh, one moment! Don't forget to powder your noses."</p>

<p>The group went their way, making insubordinate but heartfelt
comments on the manners and customs of sergeants.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tydvil Jones, alias Basil Williams, was in his own
proper person seated in the chair in his bedroom offering profuse
thanks to Mr. Senior in a subdued voice lest he attracted
attention from the outside. He was very glad to become Tydvil
Jones again, because Basil Williams had been very much the worse
for wear, and not remarkably sober.</p>

<p>Then he pulled himself up, noticing for the first time the
dejected air of his friend. Nicholas was again seated on the edge
of the bed, melancholy in every line of his pose.</p>

<p>"By Jove! Nicholas," he enquired anxiously, "what's happened?
You look done in."</p>

<p>Nicholas straightened himself. "Tydvil," he answered
miserably, "I'm too ashamed almost to face you. I have fallen
down on my job."</p>

<p>Enlightenment came to Tydvil. "Amy?" he asked. Nicholas
nodded. "She talked..."</p>

<p>"Ah! Buck up, Nicholas, and forget it. I'm terribly sorry. It
wasn't fair to ask you to carry on with a job like that."</p>

<p>But Mr. Senior was not consoled. "You haven't heard the
worst," he went on.</p>

<p>"What was it? The court affair?" asked Tydvil curiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, I bluffed her off that," replied Nicholas. "It was really
the Moral Uplift Society and your letter to the papers that
caused it. She's&mdash;er&mdash;well, annoyed&mdash;and
I&mdash;I..." The confession would not come.</p>

<p>"Holy Wars! Nicholas, did she get that cheque?" Tydvil
whispered in dismay.</p>

<p>Nicholas nodded. "Oh, Tydvil, I am ashamed, but..."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you have done a bunk up here as I told you?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"That is what caused the trouble," explained Mr. Senior. "She
got in, too, and beat me to the key."</p>

<p>"You were locked in with her?" Tydvil's dismay changed to
heartfelt pity.</p>

<p>"For two hours nearly," admitted Nicholas, "and she
talked..."</p>

<p>"She would," agreed Tydvil, with deep understanding.
"Nicholas, I apologise with all my heart. It was not fair to you
to let you run such a risk."</p>

<p>"But I failed. I betrayed your trust, my friend." Nicholas
took his wallet from his pocket, and drawing out the promissory
note, offered it to Tydvil.</p>

<p>Tydvil waved it away, smiling. "Dash it all, Nicholas! Ours is
a gentleman's agreement. Do you take me for a usurer? The fault
was mine entirely. You should he the one to complain."</p>

<p>"By Jove, Tydvil, you're a sportsman! But you must let me
reimburse you for the cheque..."</p>

<p>"I don't deserve it, but if it's on your conscience you may do
so." Then he laughed wryly. "Amy will gloat, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"It puts you in such a hole over that letter," Nicholas
sympathised.</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Tydvil, "she's got me there, but..." He broke
off suddenly. "Listen, Nicholas! Do you think you could arrange
an accidental meeting between Amy and me, as Billy Brewer, in a
way that would make her feel grateful to Brewer&mdash;that's
me?"</p>

<p>The face of Mr. Senior grew brighter. "Yesterday," he replied,
"I would have protested that the idea was not sporting. Now," and
he smiled a sour smile, "I feel that your plan involves less than
retributive justice. I'll take care, too, that there are no
complications with Brewer."</p>

<p>"Good!" replied Tydvil with sinister emphasis. "And then we
shall see what we shall see. Let me know when you're ready, but
not until Brewer's eye is normal."</p>

<p>"Talking of eyes," said Nicholas, "I noticed one of those
policemen you were engaged with, had a beauty."</p>

<p>Tydvil chuckled reminiscently. "Phew! That was swift going
while it lasted..."</p>

<p>"You seem to have quite a flair for mixing it with the
law&mdash; what led up to that picnic you were having?" Senior
asked curiously.</p>

<p>It appeared that Tydvil had met a charming young woman named
Elsie. He was rather indefinite as to how or where the
acquaintance was made, and Nicholas, recognising his
embarrassment, forbore to press for details. Anyway, Elsie
suggested that there was plenty of fun to be had at a night club
she knew of in Little Collins Street, just off Exhibition
Street.</p>

<p>"It was quite a pleasant place," Tydvil explained, "with a
Bohemian atmosphere. We had supper, at least, Elsie had supper,
but I joined her in the wine."</p>

<p>"I should say you did," commented Nicholas.</p>

<p>Tydvil nodded a plea of guilty. "You see, Elsie knew nearly
everyone in the place. She seemed very popular. She introduced me
to a lot of people..." He paused.</p>

<p>"And the night grew wet," Nicholas suggested.</p>

<p>"Not at first," Tydvil explained. "Among them was a man I
knew, Archie Graham, of Graham and Stone&mdash;they have a place
in the Lane. He joined us with a large blonde named Minnie. When
I told him I was Basil Williams and came from Castlemaine, he
said he knew my father."</p>

<p>Nicholas, who was consulting his master card, looked up. "If
it is I he means, I'll say he does know me. But not as well as I
know him."</p>

<p>"Well," continued Tydvil, "we had a few bottles of champagne,
and Graham said there was nothing in it, and called for burgundy.
And then two or three of Graham's friends joined us&mdash;there
was an orchestra&mdash;and Elsie and Minnie tried to teach me to
dance."</p>

<p>"Seems innocent enough so far," commented Nicholas.</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Tydvil, "it was not until we turned over the
tables and made a steeplechase course, that it began to get
really lively."</p>

<p>"Bright idea," smiled Nicholas.</p>

<p>"It was a lot brighter when Graham proposed fox hunting with
Elsie and Minnie as foxes. The men had to go over the jumps, but
the foxes could go round them. Then most of the men joined in,
and all the girls wanted to be foxes, too." Tydvil paused
reflectively. "I think that the trouble began about then."</p>

<p>"You certainly had the material for it," smiled Nicholas.</p>

<p>"You see," Tydvil explained, "clearing the jumps was not so
easy as you'd think because of the champagne and burgundy, and we
were a bit crowded. I was going strong after my fox, Elsie, when
some fellow got ahead of me and caught her. I came up and
explained that the game was for hunters and not for hounds..." He
paused a moment, and went on, "You know, I thought at the time
that sounded funny. He didn't seem to like it, and tried to hit
me."</p>

<p>"Well?" queried Nicholas.</p>

<p>"That started it all," Tydvil explained. "He was standing in
front of a hurdle, and when I slugged him he went over backward,
and then his fox, a dashed little Jezebel, took a swipe at me
with a bottle. So Elsie tried to strangle her, and then
everybody, seemed to join in at once. All I know is, I was trying
to get Elsie away when someone threw a handful of spaghetti in my
face, and I pulled a leg off one of the tables and went after
him."</p>

<p>"By Jove! Tydvil," laughed Nicholas, "considering your lack of
experience, you displayed excellent technique in an
emergency."</p>

<p>"Not at all," disclaimed Tydvil modestly. "It was just
instinct. That spaghetti roused my worst feeling, and I wanted to
do something worth while to the man who threw it. He reached the
door about two jumps ahead of me, and then someone switched off
the lights. A lot of good that did," he laughed, "because they
all came out into the street and carried on."</p>

<p>"And then?" Nicholas asked.</p>

<p>"To tell you the honest truth, I don't know much about it. I
was trying to knock out the spaghetti man when the police
arrived, and I had to leave my man to attend to them. They had
about got me done up. I was on my back and just managed to let
out with both legs and get two of them, when you arrived."</p>

<p>"Well," came Mr. Senior's verdict, "all I can say is, that for
a man of your limited training, your success has been
phenomenal."</p>

<p>"You are proud of your pupil?" Tydvil laughed.</p>

<p>"Pupil, indeed!" Nicholas replied. "You don't want any
teaching; your capacity for finding trouble is native genius. But
I think you had better get to bed."</p>

<p>Tydvil stood up. "I think you're right. Oh, by, the way. I
have an appointment to meet Archie Graham at his place for a game
of poker in a night or two."</p>

<p>"Well, try not to bring in the police force again," was Mr.
Senior's friendly advice.</p>

<p>"See you tomorrow&mdash;no, tonight at dinner," said Tydvil
glancing at the clock.</p>

<p>Mr. Senior left him to his well-earned rest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p>Geraldine Brand sat in her place at the table of Tydvil Jones,
just as she had sat two mornings earlier, swishing the blade of a
paper knife through the envelopes of the morning mail. But her
mind was not on her work. Geraldine was listening, and was
beginning to fear she would listen in vain. She had almost lost
hope when she heard an uncertain step approaching the door of the
office. It was a step she could have picked out from an army,
despite its hesitation. If Billy Brewer could have seen the light
in Geraldine's eyes as she raised her head at the sound, he would
not have delayed his entrance.</p>

<p>When he did summon up courage to cross the threshold; her head
was bent intently over her work. His eyes were so absorbed in the
general beauty of the girlscape, that they missed the important
detail that the shapely, capable hands were a little unsteady in
their movements. It was remarkable that the two so usually self-
assured and self-possessed young people were at the moment
feeling just a little scared. To both, the experience of feeling
scared was novel and unsettling.</p>

<p>Although she had given no sign of knowledge of his presence,
Billy knew she was aware of it. He waited a moment in
trepidation, but when the expected order of eviction did not
come, he took courage. He moved quietly round the table and
seated himself in Tydvil's chair. As he did so her lashes flicked
upwards for a fraction of a second, and then went on with her
work. To Billy, the reception was not encouraging, but then he
did not know that Geraldine, at the moment, was almost afraid to
let him see her eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. William Brewer was not looking his best, or feeling his
best. Although much of the swelling had left his eye, its colour
was still rich and variegated. Moreover, he had had a sleepless
night trying to solve the mystery of the calamities that had
befallen him, but it was an instance in which night had brought
neither counsel nor consolation.</p>

<p>At the moment he never in his life had felt the need for
sympathy and understanding more acutely. Instinct had drawn him
to Geraldine against the better judgment of his reason.</p>

<p>Then the sight of her and her silence gave him daring.
"Gerald&mdash;I mean," he cut the word short, "I mean, Miss
Brand."</p>

<p>Geraldine's heart was chanting "Te Deums," but all she said
was a non-committal and interrogative, "Well?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask you something."</p>

<p>Again, "Well?"</p>

<p>"Did you..." Billy's words stumbled. "Have you read last
night's paper? I mean that stuff about me."</p>

<p>"I did," murmured the bent head, "and this morning's papers
also."</p>

<p>Billy flushed uncomfortably. He had become "news," and the
morning papers had "done him proud." One of them had found room
for a shocked sub-leader on the prevalence of perjury in the
courts of justice. However, Billy was determined to have his
say.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you this, and please believe me, it is true, I
never was near Hilda Cranston that night. On my word of honour."
The memory of his wrongs drowned his hesitation. "You think you
saw me speaking to her. I swear I was not. I haven't seen her for
months. And I haven't the vaguest idea what Mrs. Jones was
talking about. Please believe me, Geraldine."</p>

<p>Geraldine laid down the paper knife and, for the first time,
looked Billy in the face. At the moment she did not care what he
could read in it. The misery in his voice hurt. Then, as calmly
as her voice would permit, she said, "I know now that it was all
some dreadful mix up. And I want to apologise for what I
said&mdash;I am sorry, really&mdash;Billy." That "Billy" slipped
out before she could stop it.</p>

<p>In the one active eye of Billy Brewer, rose a sudden light. He
half stood up, but a peremptory gesture of her hand sent him back
to the seat. "But," he exclaimed breathlessly, "you called me
Billy!"</p>

<p>Geraldine's attempt to compose her face into lines of severity
was not altogether successful. "That slip was no reason for you
to be silly." But she knew she had lost her grip.</p>

<p>"Call me Billy again," he demanded.</p>

<p>"I'll call you something that will astonish you in a moment if
you're not serious. Don't you see we have to talk this thing
over?"</p>

<p>"But..."</p>

<p>"No, stop!" she half pleaded. "You must tell me everything,
can't you see how important it is? Please&mdash;Billy!"</p>

<p>Billy resigned himself to her voice. There was a note in it
that made him feel a little dizzy. "All right, I'll be a good
boy, mamma. What do you want to know?"</p>

<p>"Everything," she insisted.</p>

<p>"It's all so crazy," he said a little doubtfully. "That I'm
afraid you'll think I'm the world's Olympic liar."</p>

<p>She laughed. "Not this time, Billy.
Come&mdash;everything!"</p>

<p>"Well, here goes!" he said. "But, remember I warned you it's
absolutely barmy." And Billy unfolded his story as it appeared to
him.</p>

<p>Geraldine listened intently. She was one of the rare women who
could refrain from interruption. It was only when he had
described Tydvil's surprising appearance in court that she said
emphatically, "And that evidence was flat perjury."</p>

<p>"You knew that?" Billy asked in wonder.</p>

<p>"Of course I did. I knew as well as you did he was not working
back. I can always tell from his table. This man Mr. Olden, who
is he?"</p>

<p>"Don't know him from a bar of soap. A most impressive looking
bird. But Tyddie..."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;don't stop," she insisted.</p>

<p>She heard the Jerry McCann episode with a little wrinkle in
the smooth forehead. "You're perfectly sure he said ten o'clock?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Absolutely," Billy asserted. "And the amazing part of it is
that Jerry knew his reputation as a wowser too well to go near
him, dead or alive."</p>

<p>When Billy had closed his narrative with an account of the
eleven pounds that someone had paid on his behalf, he continued
with a sigh. "All I can make of it is that I must have a double.
What do you think?"</p>

<p>"Double!" Geraldine sniffed. "It would take a treble to
account for all that. Billy, there is only, one thing about it I
am sure of, and that is that Mr. Tydvil Jones is the most
unmitigated fibber on earth&mdash;and that is understating
it."</p>

<p>"But," protested Billy, "he only did it to get me out of a
mess."</p>

<p>"Um-m!" murmured Miss Brand. "That doesn't account for that
Jerry McCann whopper." Then she smiled at him. "Tell me, Billy,
you ought to know, why do men tell their biggest fibs?"</p>

<p>"Firmly disregarding the implied libel," said Billy, "I should
say it is because they have something to hide."</p>

<p>"Yes..."</p>

<p>At that moment a knock at the open door cut her short. Both
stared towards it. Framed in the doorway, and occupying most of
its space, was a policeman.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tydvil Jones?" enquired the apparition that made Billy
wonder if some fresh calamity were about to overtake him.</p>

<p>Geraldine stood up. "This is his office, but he has not come
in yet. Is there anything wrong? I am his secretary."</p>

<p>Constable O'Connor advanced two steps into the room. His
official voice lost its edge as he met the frank eyes of the tall
damsel who spoke. "I've been sent down from Russell Street about
this hat, Miss." He held out a grey felt to her.</p>

<p>Taking it, Geraldine turned it over. "Why!" she exclaimed,
"this is Mr. Jones's hat! Where did you get it?"</p>

<p>"Exhibition Street, last night. Eleven forty-five p.m.
Believed to be stolen." He spoke as though from the witness
box.</p>

<p>"But how...?" Her voice trailed off as she looked from the hat
to Billy, who was now on his feet.</p>

<p>"There was a big brawl, Miss. You might have seen about it in
the papers. We arrested fourteen of them. The man who was wearing
the hat seemed to be ringleader&mdash;he escaped. We thought Mr.
Jones might be able to identify him."</p>

<p>"Do you know what he was like?" asked Billy, taking the hat
from Geraldine.</p>

<p>"About six feet or a little more. Dark suit, black hair, broad
shoulders, rather prominent nose. When I saw him first he was
trying to out another man with a leg of a table. Fought like a
bear cat. Got away from six of us. Just vanished!"</p>

<p>Seeing the astonishment in Billy's eyes, he went on. "Just as
I said, sir. Just vanished. We thought you might have seen
someone like him hanging round the place."</p>

<p>The eyes of Geraldine and Billy met in bewilderment over the
grey felt. "Have you?" she asked.</p>

<p>Billy was equally mystified, and said so.</p>

<p>"We'd be glad to get him," the constable said with some
feeling.</p>

<p>"Well," said Geraldine, "if you like to leave it here I'll
enquire from Mr. Jones as soon as he comes in." Constable
O'Connor left with the assurance that if Mr. Jones could throw
any light on the matter he would communicate with Russell Street
at once.</p>

<p>When the uniform had disappeared, Geraldine placed the hat on
the table, and the two stared at it as though at some strange
portent.</p>

<p>Said Geraldine, "Queer? That hat was hanging on its peg when I
left the office last night."</p>

<p>"Well, that's queer," was all Mr. Brewer could find to
say.</p>

<p>"Must have been pinched," ventured Billy. Then, after a
moment, "It doesn't seem to make sense."</p>

<p>"It makes as much sense as the Jerry McCann business and all
the rest of it. I wish the thing could speak," she said, taking
up the hat again.</p>

<p>"But surely you don't think...?" Billy did not like to put the
amazing question into words.</p>

<p>"That Tyddie has taken to rioting and assaulting the police?"
Geraldine had not such fine scruples. "The other Billy Brewer
did," she added.</p>

<p>"It's mad&mdash;mad!" insisted Billy.</p>

<p>"So's the whole business," averred Miss Brand, "but I'm
perfectly certain, without any evidence but his preposterous
stories, that he could explain everything."</p>

<p>"And what then?"</p>

<p>She tossed the hat back on to the table. "I don't know. But,"
and her voice took on a note of determination, "I'm going to find
out."</p>

<p>"But Tyddie&mdash;impossible!"</p>

<p>"Why impossible?" she demanded. "He's a man, isn't he? Where
was he the night before last? He was not here."</p>

<p>"But Geraldine," he persuaded, "why should you get yourself
mixed up in it?"</p>

<p>"If it comes to that," she answered, not looking up, "why
should you be blamed for something you didn't do?"</p>

<p>Billy was standing beside her. "Geraldine&mdash;do you really
care if I am unfairly blamed?" he almost whispered.</p>

<p>Then Geraldine Brand, very incautiously, looked up. He gave
her no time to reply. She did not know how it happened, but the
next moment she found herself in his arms, feeling quite at home
and deliriously happy.</p>

<p>When, perhaps thirty seconds later, Mr. Tydvil Jones entered
his office, he stopped abruptly. The spectacle that greeted his
eyes was that of his senior city representative standing with one
arm round the waist of Miss Geraldine Brand, and the other about
her shoulders. Miss Geraldine Brand's very conspicuous head was
resting on the shoulder of Mr. William Brewer and both her arms
were round his neck. The two were evidently utterly insensible to
any outside impressions.</p>

<p>Tydvil felt slightly embarrassed, but, after all, it was his
office. After giving them what he considered ample time to come
out of their trance, he said, a little apologetically, "Pardon
me, if I am intruding."</p>

<p>The only effect of his voice was that the group relaxed
slightly. One of Billy's arms fell from her shoulder, and one of
Geraldine's came from his neck. Her head remained in situ, though
she turned it slightly to look at him.</p>

<p>There was that in her eyes which made Tydvil Jones envy
William Brewer. That they had settled their differences gave him
a feeling of satisfaction. Billy, deserved some compensation, and
he felt that this was ample. A wide smile broke on his face. Said
he, "Guard with your left, Brewer, or you'll have a pair of
them."</p>

<p>The only response of the unabashed Geraldine was to turn her
lips deliberately to Brewer's.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones threw back his head and laughed heartily at the
gesture of defiance. "You win, Miss Brand. Congratulations,
Brewer!" He held out his hand.</p>

<p>Billy's spare hand took it and shook it warmly.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about it?" asked Geraldine
uncompromisingly.</p>

<p>"I?" laughed Tydvil. "Nothing! I should say that Billy has
done everything necessary."</p>

<p>It was the first time either of them had known Tydvil so far
unbend as to use the Christian name of one of his staff. It made
them both realise that all was well.</p>

<p>"But still," Tydvil went on, unfastening his overcoat, "if you
could possibly unwrap yourselves, we might think about the mail.
I only offer it as a suggestion." He wriggled himself out of the
coat.</p>

<p>Geraldine's arms relaxed slowly, and she smiled. "Thank you,
Mr. Jones." Then, after a pause, she added, "But it would have
been nicer if you had come in a little later."</p>

<p>Geraldine's contribution to the conversation rather startled
Billy, who did not quite know whether he stood right side up or
inverted. Tyddie did not usually take kindly to airy
persiflage.</p>

<p>But Tydvil looked from one to the other in evident amusement.
"Don't take any notice of what she says, Brewer. You know, when
people are coming from under an anaesthetic they often talk
queerly."</p>

<p>She patted her somewhat disordered copper helm, now perfectly
self-possessed. "I don't like you to call him an anaesthetic,"
she smiled at Tydvil. "I find him a stimulant."</p>

<p>"Oh," he held up his hands, "have it your own way! I am not
going to argue." Then, in mock anger, "Are you, or are you not,
going to begin work this morning."</p>

<p>Here Billy found his voice for the first time. He felt some
sort of apology or explanation was due to Tydvil. "I would like
to say, sir..."</p>

<p>Tydvil cut him short with a laugh. "Save it, Brewer, you
duffer! Let us get on with our work now, and come back and take
her to lunch. If you don't, I will."</p>

<p>Billy caught Geraldine's eye and obeyed without further
attempt at explanations. Geraldine's thoughts had been working at
something like three thousand revolutions a minute. As the door
closed behind him, she turned to Tydvil who was putting his coat
on a hanger. "Can you tell me anything of how your hat was
stolen, Mr. Jones?" she asked. "A policeman brought it back this
morning and made enquiries."</p>

<p>Although Tydvil's face was quite composed as he turned round,
Geraldine had not missed the start he had given at her words.
"Dear me, so that is what became of it!" He stared curiously at
the hat, and there was uneasiness in his voice. It was too
casual, and Geraldine recognised the fact.</p>

<p>"Where was it found?" he asked.</p>

<p>Geraldine gave a dramatic and highly coloured account of a
dreadful man who was attempting to murder another with a club,
and who had wrought fearful havoc among the police. "Isn't it
awful, Mr. Jones," she added, "he must have been in here."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" he smiled, "not here. I was having dinner at the
Carlton, and it was taken by someone." Tydvil was quite pleased
with his fertility of imagination. "I hope they captured the
man," he added.</p>

<p>"No," replied Geraldine. "The brute escaped. The policeman
said he just vanished, but that's absurd. However, they have a
good description. They say he is a horrid, dark man, with a big
nose and broad shoulders."</p>

<p>Mr. Jones shook his head. "Dreadful," he said. "Drink, no
doubt!" But somehow Geraldine sensed, with that sense that the
Creator has given to women to allow her to bowl out iniquitous
man, that the impeccable Tydvil Jones was fibbing like all his
sex, and was just slightly over-acting a part.</p>

<p>"The policeman asked me to ring up Russell Street when you
came in, if you could help at all. They're very anxious to get
that ruffian."</p>

<p>"Urn," said Tydvil. "Better explain that it was taken from the
Carlton, and express my regret that I cannot assist them."</p>

<p>He had taken his seat, and as he spoke he glanced across the
table at the mail. About one quarter of the letters were still
unopened. He pointed an accusing finger at them. "Oh, Miss Brand!
Miss Brand!"</p>

<p>Geraldine flushed guiltily. For the first time since she had
been his secretary she had failed him. She began to stammer an
apology. But he only laughed. "Guilty with extenuating
circumstances. Now you listen to me, young woman. You tell that
William Brewer of yours to keep out of this room&mdash;at least
until the mail is sorted. He's a disruptive element."</p>

<p>"He's nothing of the kind," she answered warmly.</p>

<p>"If I say he is, he is!" Tydvil insisted. "He's worse than
that. He's a pestilent secretary stealer. That's what I think of
him. But it's no use doing anything now since the damage is
done."</p>

<p>That morning when she returned to her desk in the outer
office, Geraldine found a pencil scribbled note on her table.
Shorn of the florid opening lines, which Geraldine thought were
the best part of it, it ran: "Look at page three, The Age, I've
marked the column. W." Turning to the place, Geraldine read with
absorbed interest half a column of lurid narrative of certain
happenings in Exhibition Street on the previous night. When she
had finished she decided that if Tydvil were even remotely
associated with them, it would not be surprising if he were
unwilling to allow the fact to become public.</p>

<p>Still later in the day, she was given new, but not altogether
unexpected, food for thought. Tony, the night-watchman of the
warehouse, came to hand in his weekly report, which always passed
through Geraldine's hands. Tony was one of her very numerous
admirers. She knew all about his family, and their ailments. She
was running her eye over the report when he volunteered,
"Governor's been back late this week, Miss Brand."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said, without looking up. "Of course, you'd notice
him."</p>

<p>"I'd be able to pick the Governor by his walk from a thousand.
Spotted him last night as soon as he turned out of Swanston
Street."</p>

<p>Geraldine pricked up her ears. Still looking at the report
card, she said, "Yes, I wonder he didn't get his death of cold,
without his hat."</p>

<p>"Without his hat!" Tony's surprise was unmistakable and
genuine. "Him without his hat! Someone must have been pullin'
your leg, Miss Brand. I seen him as he passed as close as I am to
you. It was just ten past eight, and he was wearin' a grey
felt."</p>

<p>She smiled up at him. "I must have misunderstood, Tony. Of
course it wouldn't be likely, would it?"</p>

<p>"Not him, Miss. The governor ain't that sort," Tony
agreed.</p>

<p>When Tony had departed, Miss Brand was deep in thought as
Tydvil passed from his office into the warehouse. Her eyes
followed him as he went. "Tyddie," she addressed the straight
back in her thoughts. "I'm beginning to think you're a worse
fibber and a better man than I ever dreamed you could be."
Deciding that it was more material for herself and Billy to
discuss, she turned to her work.</p>

<hr>

<a name="ch23"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p>When, acting under his wife's most explicit instructions,
Tydvil had dressed early that evening, he found Amy was earlier,
and was awaiting his arrival in the drawing-room. As he caught
sight of her, Tydvil's eyes opened widely. Never since he had
known her had Amy worn anything but some shade of grey. Amy
appeared to think it was the chosen colour of the virtuous&mdash;
something that marked her as one apart from the world, the flesh,
and the devil. Now, she was wearing mauve&mdash;mauve relieved by
violet. Moreover, it was cut at the neck quite two inches lower
than anything that Tydvil had even seen on her. But, even so, the
strictest critic could not have classed the revelation as daring.
Great as was Tydvil's surprise, it would have been greater had he
known that a harried dressmaker had kept four girls at work all
night so that it would be finished in time for that night's
dinner.</p>

<p>Tydvil mentally admitted that he had never seen her look more
presentable. The frock had been compiled by an artist. The
compliment he paid her was not very well received. Amy said that
she was sorry she had bought it. It made her look rather more
conspicuous than she cared to be. It was a concession to fashion
that she should not have made. Having put Tydvil in his place,
she looked him over critically, straightened a tie that did not
need straightening, and suggested it was about time he procured
another dinner jacket. A man in his position should be well
dressed. For her part, her dress was never more than a secondary
consideration. "I always say, that if a woman respects herself,
others respect her. Dress does not matter." Tydvil reflected that
it was quite true that she always said that. He had heard her say
it two or three times a week for ten years or more.</p>

<p>"Who are you putting at my end?" he asked when the inspection
was over. To him, his neighbours at the table were a matter of
importance.</p>

<p>"You will take in Mrs. Blomb." Tydvil gritted his teeth. Mrs.
Blomb had very large teeth, a scraggy neck, a reputation as a
platform speaker, and she gushed. "On the other side you will
have Mr. Arthur Muskat." This announcement caused Tydvil some
difficulty in suppressing a word that would have startled Amy. It
was one he had heard in the thick of the previous night's finale
in Exhibition Street, and its force was only exceeded by its
extreme vulgarity. Muskat was his second best aversion, and the
Secretary of the Moral Uplift Society. He was large of face and
body, spoke in grunts, ate largely, and made unpleasant sounds
during mastication.</p>

<p>He detested only one man more, and that was Arthur's brother
Edwin, who was a fanatical prohibition advocate. Edwin and Arthur
were much alike, only Edwin added to the other's lack of
attractiveness a smugness and a pose of righteousness that always
gave rise in Tydvil to a longing to assault him. So that when Amy
said, "I am putting Mr. Edwin Muskat opposite Mr. Senior, because
they are both so devoted to the one great cause," Tydvil found
himself both sympathetic on Senior's behalf and at the same time
grimly amused. He became still more amused when he heard that,
beside having his hostess to talk to, Mr. Senior would make the
acquaintance of Mrs. Caton Ridgegay. She was a lady whom Mr.
Ripley would have rejected as impossible and unbelievable, both
in aspect and for a capacity for sustained speech composed of
windy inanities.</p>

<p>"And now, Tydvil," went on Amy, impressively, "I wish you to
show the very greatest consideration to Mr. Senior. He is not
only a man of remarkable attainments and distinction, but he has
most constructive plans for a prohibition campaign. I need hardly
remind you that at Home a man with such friends as the Archbishop
of Canterbury must be a personage of considerable importance. I
feel sure you cannot but benefit by cultivating his acquaintance
and friendship."</p>

<p>"Very well," Tydvil agreed. "I have no doubt he is all that
you say." His feeling of depression regarding his prospects for
the evening ordeal increased in intensity as it drew nearer.
Mentally he reviewed the other guests.</p>

<p>There was the Rev. George Claire, who had the gift of making
every topic on which he conversed intolerably boring; his wife,
Augusta, whom twenty years of married life with the Rev. George
had bereft of speech and reason, if she ever possessed any, and
Mrs. Claire's sister, Miss Eva Merrywood. Apart from Nicholas, of
their eight guests the only one who offered any prospects but
exasperation was Miss Merrywood. She was a determined female
whose hobby, was slums. Her theory was that the only way to
awaken the public conscience was to tell the unvarnished truth
about slums. This she did, and did it frankly. Her uncensored
gleanings, described in plain language with blank unconcern, had
staggered many a pious gathering. Tydvil was wondering if he
could, by some happy chance, draw her out.</p>

<p>Sometimes he felt that Amy could read his thoughts, for at
that moment she broke in on him. "I wish you particularly, to
watch Eva Merrywood, Tydvil dear. I would not have invited her,
but I wanted the vicar and Augusta, and could not very well leave
her out."</p>

<p>"Do you expect me to gag her?" asked Tydvil truculently.</p>

<p>"That is both absurd and vulgar, Tydvil," Amy snapped. "Eva
means well, but you know how indiscreet she can be. Just try to
change the conversation if necessary. Dear Eva is so very earnest
that I am afraid Mr. Senior might not understand."</p>

<p>"Ump!" Tydvil reassured her. "Anyone who can fail to
understand Miss Merry wood's stories would need to be pretty
dull. Your Mr. Senior would be lucky if he could misunderstand
them."</p>

<p>"Sometimes, Tydvil dear, I think you try to provoke me
purposely. I have been trying to forget your conduct during the
past few days..."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Blomb," announced a maid from the door.</p>

<p>For the first time since he had met her, Tydvil welcomed the
presence of Mrs. Blomb. He returned her greeting politely and
stood aside watching her take in Amy's costume in gulps. She
grasped a hand of Amy in each of her own, and exclaimed in her
platform voice, "Amy!&mdash;dear! How truly charming. Quite
Parisian, really!" Turning her face to Tydvil, "You must be proud
of our dear Amy, Mr. Jones, now, confess!"</p>

<p>Tydvil modestly admitted the impeachment and was relieved from
further violation of his conscience by the arrival of the two
Muskats. He was well out of the frying pan into the middle of the
fire, because Arthur Muskat deftly cornered him and, in a series
of throaty and nasal sounds, poured out his gratitude to Tydvil
for his truly Christian beneficence in the cause of the Moral
Uplift Society. "My Dear Sir," he rumbled, "I trust you will take
most severe steps against the scoundrel who forged those
insulting letters to the papers."</p>

<p>Tydvil attempted to protest, but he may as well have tried to
oppose his strength to a road roller.</p>

<p>"Your disinclination to punish the affront is in keeping with
your own high standards of Christian forbearance. But is it wise,
my dear Mr. Jones? No, pray do not deny it! Our dear Mrs. Jones
has told me everything. How the moment you saw those letters you
determined to give them the lie direct with your gracious gift.
It was a splendid gesture, splendid!"</p>

<p>The revelation of Amy's tactical move sent a surge of anger
through Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Ah! There is no need to blush, Mr. Jones," grunted Arthur
Muskat. "In my own poor efforts in the cause of Moral Uplift I
sincerely trust that the cause is worthy of the source of the
gift."</p>

<p>"In that, I feel you are right." Tydvil spoke with profound
conviction. It was the first time for many months that he had
felt in complete agreement with the secretary of the society.</p>

<p>"Now," continued Mr. Muskat, "I have been given the privilege
of letting you into a little secret. It was, indeed, your dear
wife to whom I am indebted for it. We have arranged for you to be
present at a meeting of the members at which we may, be able to
express our gratitude. Inadequately, I am afraid, my dear sir,
but we will do our best."</p>

<p>During Mr. Muskat's outpourings the remainder of the guests
had arrived, the last of who was Mr. Senior. It was the stir
caused by his entrance that enabled Tydvil to escape from his
tormentor, and to suppress an explosion that might have
astonished the secretary of the Moral Uplift Society.</p>

<p>As he and Muskat moved to the group surrounding Amy, she was
presenting her friends to the guest of honour. The wrath of
Tydvil was almost forgotten as he saw the perfect ease with which
Nicholas received the tributes with which the very proud and
somewhat flustered Amy conducted the ceremony. He hung back to
give the others precedence.</p>

<p>"And," gushed Amy finally, placing an affectionate hand on
Tydvil's shoulder, "this is my husband!" There was no need for
Tydvil to feign his pleasure at the meeting. For him it had been
a case of "Blucher or night." Only the strength of Nicholas as a
reinforcement saved the day for him. Mr. Senior evinced a
pleasure equal to his own as they shook hands. "Ah!" exclaimed
Mr. Senior, "I almost feel I have already met you, Mr. Jones. In
the short time I have been in Melbourne I have come across
evidence of your good works everywhere."</p>

<p>Tydvil accepted the compliment blandly. "And I have already
heard so much of you, Mr. Senior. You have one very staunch
admirer that I know of." He inclined his head towards the smiling
Amy. His eyes twinkled as he added, "I feel I have met a kindred
spirit."</p>

<p>It was then that Arthur Muskat, oozing unction, broke in,
"There is something that you will all be pleased, but not
surprised, to hear..."</p>

<p>A desperate attempt to stave off the revelation by Tydvil
failed dismally. He felt that at this juncture it would be
rubbing salt into Nicholas' wounded feelings.</p>

<p>"That infamous letter in the papers regarding the Moral Uplift
Society proves to be a forgery. I feel that none of us could
believe for a moment that Mr. Jones wrote it. But..." and Mr.
Muskat beamed largely on the circle, "he has given it a defiant
and purely Christian denial by handing us a cheque for one
thousand pounds." He rolled out the figures triumphantly.</p>

<p>In the outburst of admiration that followed the announcement,
Tydvil alone noticed the flush on Nicholas's face. There seemed
to be something in that tag, "Tell the truth and shame the
Devil." Then inspiration came.</p>

<p>"One moment!" he interposed. "Just before you arrived, my wife
and I had reached an agreement that to contradict that letter
publicly would be merely drawing attention to it. She of eels as
keenly as I do that my little contribution must be kept secret.
Don't you, Amy?" he asked with malicious meaning.</p>

<p>Under the gaze of all eyes Amy had no option but to agree, but
only Tydvil, who knew her so well, was aware of the acid behind
her smile.</p>

<p>"That," said Mr. Senior, "is what I should call spiking the
guns of the enemy. An idea worthy of you, Mr. Jones." Only Tydvil
was able to read the glance of amusement in his eyes.</p>

<p>"A concession to evil, I am afraid," was Mr. Edwin Muskat's
contribution.</p>

<p>"I cannot agree with Edwin," the vicar spoke judicially. "I
regard Tydvil's course as both Christian and dignified."</p>

<p>But the conscience of Edwin Muskat was not appeased. Forgery
was a sin against society, and one that demanded retribution.</p>

<p>The argument that ensued gave Tydvil the chance he was looking
for. He drew Nicholas aside for a moment. "Listen, Nicholas," he
whispered, "I can't stick this out. You must liven things
up."</p>

<p>Nicholas' eyes danced over the group and met Tydvil's again.
"But our hostess, Tydvil?" He shook his head. "Is it fair?"</p>

<p>"Dash the hostess," retorted Tydvil, shedding both chivalry
and loyalty to his spouse. "Doesn't the host deserve some
pity?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll do my best," Nicholas chuckled.</p>

<p>"Do your worst..." Tydvil insisted emphatically. "Tydvil
dear," broke in Amy, who had approached unnoticed, "you must not
monopolise Mr. Senior."</p>

<p>"Your husband is enlisting my assistance in a cause very dear
to his heart&mdash;and mine," Nicholas added, smiling at her.</p>

<p>Amy nodded brightly. "He and Mr. Edwin Muskat are both
enthusiasts in your own cause of prohibition. You will excuse
Tydvil for his zeal."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," laughed Mr. Senior, "that I am as bad as he is.
Do you know, Mrs. Jones, even after so brief an acquaintance I
feel I know your husband almost as well as you do. We seem to
have so much in common."</p>

<p>"I fear you are flattering Tydvil," Amy protested gaily. "You
see, he has not had your advantages of travel, Mr. Senior."</p>

<p>"Ah! My dear lady," Nicholas responded, "it is not a question
of travel. Men like your husband are a product of
environment."</p>

<p>"Believe me," said Tydvil sincerely, "I owe everything to my
wife, Mr. Senior."</p>

<p>"That, I do not doubt for a moment," conceded Mr. Senior
gallantly.</p>

<p>At this moment Amy's eye was caught by that of the maid at the
door. "Come, Mr. Senior," she said. "Dinner is waiting, and you
must not flatter me so. Tydvil dear, you will take Mrs.
Blomb."</p>

<p>Amy's dinners were famous among her friends. In none of them
was the principal of temperance in beverages extended to food.
Amy's cook was an artist. As they settled into their places, Mr.
Arthur Muskat unfolded his table napkin as though he were
performing a rite. Mrs. Blomb raised her eyes from her plate and
confided in Tydvil that she was afraid she was greedy because
dear Amy's devilled oysters had become almost an obsession with
her. Even the voice of the vicar, who, at a nod from Amy, had
recited grace, seemed richer with a note of anticipation.</p>

<p>But, for the first time in his life, Tydvil regarded the table
with real distaste. He had come to feel that the iced barley-
water and fruit cup that accompanied the meal were a poor
substitute for something with more kick and inspiration in it. He
thought of his dinner with Hilda Cranston with regret for its
gaiety, and he almost groaned over the memory of the burgundy of
the previous night.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blomb, however, gave him scant time to regret anything
but her existence. She had been speaking at a meeting of the
Women's Liberal Union that afternoon, and Tydvil heard first of
the odious apathy and indifference to great political issues
exhibited by the majority of the sex, and then she began to
inundate him with a generous resume of her address. On the other
side, Mr. Arthur Muskat was so profoundly absorbed in beche-de-
mere soup that the last trump would not have stirred him. Though,
Tydvil, through the momentary pauses in Mrs. Blomb's monologue,
could distinctly hear his appreciation of it&mdash;the soup, not
the monologue.</p>

<p>Years of experience of Amy's habits of speech had endowed
Tydvil with the priceless gift of apparent courteous attention
while his mind was set free to follow its own vagrant devices. He
could follow Mrs. Blomb's arguments on the necessity for the
reform of arbitration legislation, for which he did not care one
hoot in Hades, and drop an intelligent comment into its proper
place, while at the same time he was following intently the
features of the social circus.</p>

<p>Amy was not looking pleased, because Mrs. Ridgegay had cut
into her conversation with Mr. Senior with an apparently
interminable account of a niece, aged seven, who read and took an
intelligent interest in Browning, or was it Wordsworth. She
always got Browning and Wordsworth mixed up, she confessed. But
she felt sure that Mr. Senior shared her love of poetry because
it was so uplifting. Of course, he, Mr. Senior, would not know
that her niece was the daughter of her sister, Emily; Mr. Senior
should really meet Emily because she was so interested in
dogs.</p>

<p>As he grasped these fragments of Mrs. Ridgegay's conversation,
Tydvil gathered from the expression on Nicholas' face that his
desire to meet Emily was non-existent. Amy looked as though
failing the pleasure of strangling Mrs. Caton Ridgegay, nothing
would give her greater satisfaction than to vent her displeasure
on the sister. It was clear at the moment that Amy simply hated
the whole Ridgegay family.</p>

<p>Neither did Amy, seem at all interested in the vicar's views
on the subject of condoning forgery. It was just then that Tydvil
caught his wife's eye, that directed him urgently to Eva
Merrywood. Mrs. Blomb's voice blanketed that of Eva, but the
expression of outraged modesty on the face of Edwin Musket beside
her told its own tale, if it did not tell Eva's. But Tydvil
judged from Edwin's blushes that it must have been one of her
best. He was sorry he had missed it, and had no sympathy for
Edwin. Deliberately, and with malice a forethought, he calmly
disregarded Amy's S.O.S. Who was he that he should discourage the
good works of Eva Merrywood?</p>

<p>Almost immediately Mrs. Blomb claimed his entire attention
with a sudden exclamation of joy. She was holding a partially
emptied goblet of fruit cup in her hand. As he turned, she said,
"Oh, Mr. Jones, our dear Amy has given us a delightful surprise!
A new fruit cup! Oh, most delicious! I must get the recipe from
her. How does she think of these wonderful things?"</p>

<p>Tydvil, who had heard nothing of any new excursions by Amy
into the concoction of temperance beverages, lifted his glass to
his lips. The first sip halted him. He took a second and glanced
up the table. As he did so he caught a flicker of light in
Nicholas' eye, and understood. Then he swallowed several
appreciative mouthsfull. He was too new in his knowledge of
alcohol to recognise the source of that rich aroma of soft
alluring flavour that blended so well with the fruit, but it
dawned on him that, whatever it was, Nicholas had been more than
generous.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blomb's enthusiasm had, for the moment, silenced the
table. One and all were tentatively supping from their glasses.
One and all re-echoed the praise of Mrs. Blomb. Edwin Muskat and
the vicar were drinking barley-water. But the vicar, after half
emptying his glass, replaced it on the table and remarked, that,
though he was, alas, unable to drink sweet beverages because of
his digestion, he had never tasted barley-water that was so
"comforting," if he might use the term. Again Tydvil's eye sought
that of Nicholas, from whom he received a confirming but almost
imperceptible flicker of his eyelashes.</p>

<p>Amy sipped bird-like from her goblet and smilingly accepted
the applause of her guests. Although she 'Was really at a loss to
account for the attractive flavour, she said, "I'm delighted you
like it. It is just a little idea of my own."</p>

<p>"Please, Amy, tell us?" pleaded Mrs. Caton Ridgegay, for the
moment forgetting her niece. As she spoke, Tydvil noticed with a
fearful joy that Arthur Muskat had nodded to the maid to refill
his goblet.</p>

<p>Amy shook her head at both Mrs. Ridgegay and Mrs. Blomb. "No,
my dears," she smiled, "you must let me keep my little
secrets."</p>

<p>For the moment the conversation was resumed. Warned, Tydvil
dealt circumspectly with what he suspected was something more
potent than his brief experience of bottled joy producers had
encountered. He recognised its effects in the rising voices. Mrs.
Blomb warmed to her denunciation of the Arbitration Act. She held
all Tydvil's attention that he could spare from the others.</p>

<p>"You have met Mr. Garside, have you not?" she asked Tydvil,
naming the Federal Attorney-General.</p>

<p>Tydvil disclaimed the honour.</p>

<p>"Well, believe it or not, that man's a pig," Mrs. Blomb
affirmed. "I've talked to him about clause four till I was
sick..."</p>

<p>"Till he was sick, you mean," came surprisingly from Arthur
Muskat as he paused in his operations on a cut from a saddle of
lamb.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blomb gazed at him thoughtfully a moment as though she
had not heard aright. Then she laughed loudly and patted Tydvil's
arm. "Listen to him. He thinks I said Mr. Garside was sick."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't." Muskat put down his knife and fork and replied
argumentatively. "What I meant was you must both have been sick.
You'd make anyone sick," he grunted.</p>

<p>"I think that is very rude of you, Mr. Muskat," protested Mrs.
Blomb loudly.</p>

<p>Entirely disregarding the protest, Arthur Muskat hiccoughed
violently, and resumed his knife and fork. So far as he was
concerned, Mrs. Blomb had ceased to exist.</p>

<p>Tydvil, struggling with an urge to laugh, noticed the working
of an agitated Adam's apple in Mrs. Blomb's stringy throat.
Lowering his voice, he said soothingly, "I don't think he
understood what you were saying." Then, to distract her
attention, he went on, "You were saying you did not like
Garside."</p>

<p>"You're right, Tydvil, I don't&mdash;Oo&mdash;I called you
Tydvil." She laughed loudly again, and slapped his shoulder. "I
tell you this, when Julia Blomb says a man's a pig, he is a pig.
Do you understand what I mean?"</p>

<p>"Did you call me a pig?" Again Arthur Muskat rumbled into the
conversation. His face was flushed and he eyed her
malevolently.</p>

<p>"I did not," she returned with spirit. "But since you ask, I
do think you're a pig, Arthur Muskat."</p>

<p>Her platform voice rose high over the now lively noise from
the other end of the table and momentarily stilled it. Then, very
distinctly in the silence, came the voice of Mrs. Claire. Her
face was flushed and her eyes were bright. Addressing her
husband, she said, "George, you preach the worst sermons and talk
the worst nonsense I ever heard."</p>

<p>There was a general gasp of surprise and Mrs. Ridgegay giggled
hysterically.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Claire observed, apparently unaware of the sensation
she had caused, "I've been wanning tell you that for years, an'
now I've tol' you!" She turned away and lapsed into silence.</p>

<p>It was not until later when he learned from Nicholas that that
gentleman had, by his own peculiar methods, introduced a charge
of fifty per cent. benedictine into the fruit cup, and a similar
proportion of proof gin into the barley-water, that Tydvil fully,
understood the unusual demeanour of Amy's guests. Under the
genial influence of the fruit cup, inhibitions, that had
congested the brain of Mrs. Claire over twenty years of married
life, melted like ice.</p>

<p>Even had he understood the psychological cause of his wife's
untimely candour, the shock to the vicar's amour-propre would not
have been mitigated to any great extent. His face, already
flushed, became suffused. He endeavoured, however, to pass it off
as a not too successful effort at humour on the part of his
partner. His laugh was rather hollow as, addressing the table
generally, he said, "A man is fortunate who can find a frank and
sincere critic in his home. It is, I feel, a salutary moral
tonic."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ridgegay, who had continued to giggle, succeeded in
emitting, "Well, if it is a tonic, vicar, you should of eel much
better after that dose."</p>

<p>But, indeed, the expression on the vicar's face was such that
it indicated if his wife's intention had been benevolent, she had
prescribed the wrong mixture. He, however, muttered that
fortunately it was his nature to accept all criticism meekly.</p>

<p>Here, reminiscence awoke in Miss Merrywood. Expressing regret
that all men were not endowed with the vicar's saintly
philosophy, which was a product of education and environment, she
related how, only on the previous day, she had assisted in
dressing the injuries of a wharf labourer's wife. She specified
their nature and locality so explicitly that Mrs. Blomb exclaimed
a scandalised "Oh! Eva!" and Amy flushed crimson. Whereat, Miss
Merrywood asserted that it was false shame not to treat these
affairs from a detached sociological aspect. The woman had done
no more than call her husband a so-and-so loafing son of a such-
and-such, which Miss Merrywood felt sure he was.</p>

<p>Inspired perhaps by the fruit cup, Eva had quoted the injured
lady verbatim, in both adjective and noun, to an audience that
gasped.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ridgegay, quite unable to adjust her mind to the relative
value of words, protested in a shocked voice, that Mrs. Claire
had said nothing like that to the vicar.</p>

<p>But Eva would have none of her. She insisted that, judged from
their respective environments, the two criticisms were
comparative equivalents.</p>

<p>Then, as Eva was apparently about to enlarge on the topic and
fearing the worst, Edwin Muskat broke in. "Did you read that
account of an appalling fracas in the city last night,
Tydvil?"</p>

<p>Welcoming the diversion, Amy, who by this time was wondering
what had happened to her party, seconded his endeavours by saying
that she was afraid Mr. Senior would receive a shocking
impression of the city from such terrible episodes.</p>

<p>"But," Edwin put in, "we can assure Mr. Senior that the very
unsavoury episode at St. Kilda, followed by the deplorable
evidences of iniquity of last night can not be taken as
altogether normal. I appeal to you, Tydvil."</p>

<p>Responded Tydvil piously, "I can assure you, Mr. Senior, that
in all my experience I have never seen anything like them."</p>

<p>"No doubt they all were caused by drink," Amy suggested.</p>

<p>"Spaghetti," put in Tydvil absently. Though he had been
careful of the fruit cup, he was feeling its influence.</p>

<p>"Tydvil dear," Amy admonished down the table, "do you think it
is wise to treat these things lightly?"</p>

<p>Arthur Muskat turned his small eyes on Tydvil. "I think,
Jones, the ruffians who were involved in that dreadful affair
will have some difficulty in proving to the bench that spaghetti
was the cause of it." He emphasised his observation with a
hiccough that seemed to disconcert him, as much as it surprised
the table.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, Mr. Muskat," Nicholas replied, "Mr. Jones's
suggestion has grounds in fact. I, myself, have seen serious and
most distressing effects from a plateful of spaghetti after
alcohol."</p>

<p>"What I say, is..." began Arthur argumentatively, but was cut
short with another resounding, "Wur-roop!"</p>

<p>This was too much for Mrs. Blomb, who was seized with almost
hysterical laughter. "Oh!" she gasped, pointing a shaking finger
at the heavy, perplexed face. "He's been&mdash;he's
been&mdash;eating spaghetti, too!"</p>

<p>Arthur Muskat's face grew purple. "You shut up, you old
hen!"</p>

<p>"Muskat! Muskat, I really must protest!" exclaimed Tydvil,
placing a restraining hand on Arthur's arm. But his heart sang
with unregenerate joy. He had often wanted to tell Mrs. Blomb she
was an old hen himself.</p>

<p>But Arthur would not be pacified. The fruit cup was in full
command. "I'll not stand it, Jones! I'll not&mdash;wurroop! She's
been picking on me all the time. She called me a&mdash;wur-
roop&mdash;pig."</p>

<p>"I'm ashamed of you, Arthur!" came a brotherly rebuke from
Edwin.</p>

<p>Arthur turned on him fiercely. "Go and bag your dashed head,
and mind your own dashed business," he shouted.</p>

<p>Rather more than half a large goblet of proof gin had loosed
some of Edwin's inhibitions. He came back with a pugnacious chin
stuck out. "You talk to me again like that, Arthur, and I'll slam
you one on the jaw!"</p>

<p>The only one among the company who was not staggered by the
outbreak of hostilities was Mrs. Claire, who, having drained a
second glass of fruit cup, sat with her face in her hands, and
her hands in a plate full of asparagus, in happy oblivion.</p>

<p>Amy, her face red and white by turns uttered a despairing,
"Oh, Tydvil! Stop them!"</p>

<p>"It's all Julia's fault!" was Mrs. Ridgegay's
contribution.</p>

<p>Julia Blomb took up the challenge with enthusiasm. "If you
think I'm going to let that fat idiot call me a hen, you're
mistaken. I said Arthur Muskat was a pig&mdash;and he is." Here
she pointed a derisive finger across the table, and babbled,
"Pig&mdash; pig&mdash;pig!"</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Blomb..." began the vicar in a deep clerical
voice of protest.</p>

<p>"I'm not your dear Mrs. Blomb," she retorted with spirit. Then
she added as an afterthought, "That's one thing I have been
spared."</p>

<p>Before the vicar could speak again, Eva Merrywood's voice cut
in. "I'm sorry to have to say it, Julia, but your speech is more
like Fitzroy than St. Kilda Road."</p>

<p>"And yours is more like a muck heap than anything else, and
I'm not sorry to say it." Mrs. Blomb's voice had a ring of
battle.</p>

<p>At this juncture, Tydvil alone noticed that Amy had scowled
the two maids out of the room. Then she turned bewildered but
appealing eyes on Nicholas. In a moment he responded by rising.
But in the brief interval the voices round the table were blended
in vociferous turmoil. The vicar was trying vainly to thump the
gathering to order. The two brothers were glaring at one another,
exchanging unbrotherly amenities. Mrs. Blomb's platform
experience gave her a considerable advantage over Mrs. Caton
Ridgegay, drowning her ineffectual retorts with vigorous, and not
exaggerated, reflections on Mrs. Ridgegay's lack of intelligence
and inane conversation. Eva Merrywood was saying things to Mrs.
Blomb that it was just as well that that lady was too busy at the
moment to assimilate. With the bonds of convention relaxed, the
mutual exchanges were sincere, but primitive in verbiage and
entirely lacking in subtlety.</p>

<p>Then the clear voice of Nicholas cut into the riot. He did not
raise it, but his, "My friends! My friends!" stilled the riot as
water drenches a. fire. The last distinguishable word was
"nitwit," from Mr. Edwin Muskat to his purple-faced brother.</p>

<p>"My friends!" continued Nicholas calmly to the faces turned
towards him. "I am afraid we have all become a little over-
wrought. I feel," his voice grew very persuasive, "that you will
forgive me, a stranger among you, for reminding you, that perhaps
we have forgotten for the moment the feelings of our kind
hostess." He smiled towards Amy's flushed face. "Let us all,
without exception, assume the others have expressed regret for
what might have been said in an unguarded moment." He paused, and
his deep luminous eyes passed from one to the other. "Will we
not?"</p>

<p>Julia Blomb drew a deep breath, and it looked for the moment
as though she would not accept any, overtures for a collective
peace. Then she caught the eye of Nicholas on her. There was
something in the glance he turned on her that sent a very cold
shiver from the base of her skull to the furthest extremity of
her spine.</p>

<p>Hastily she looked across to Arthur Muskat. "Oh, Arthur, let's
forget it all, I was silly!" There was a general murmur of
acceptance, as the smiling Nicholas resumed his seat.</p>

<p>"You know," he took the table in as he spoke, "I was just
saying to our dear Mrs. Jones, how fine it was to think..." He
paused again. "I am afraid, Vicar, that Mrs. Claire..."</p>

<p>In the excitement, that silent figure had been forgotten. In
an instant Amy and the vicar were on their feet.</p>

<p>Anxiously they raised her head. Mrs. Claire, roused from her
doze, regarded the table with sombre eyes and said thickly,
"Parcel o' fools!" and her head sunk forward again.</p>

<p>Amy and the vicar together raised her from her chair. "I can't
think..." Amy began.</p>

<p>"I've known that for years, Amy," said the surprising Mrs.
Claire, gazing owlishly at the assembly.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, my dear!" bleated Amy. "What has happened to
you?"</p>

<p>"'Runk&mdash;blinkin' 'runk," murmured Mrs. Claire
drowsily.</p>

<p>"Gwendoline!" The vicar shook her shoulder, none too tenderly.
"How can you say such a thing?"</p>

<p>"Dunno!" his spouse replied, twisting her head to look at him.
"'Cause I'm darn near speechless." Her head sunk forward again,
and she added, "You ol' buzzard!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps she had better lie down, Vicar," Amy suggested. Mrs.
Blomb and Mrs. Ridgeway rose as though to assist. But Amy waved
them back. "Don't bother, please, the Vicar and I will
manage."</p>

<p>Between them they turned the afflicted guest towards the door.
Before she passed through, she turned again. "All rotten but
Tydvil," was her Pathan shot.</p>

<p>There was an uncomfortable silence. In the absence of Amy,
Tydvil felt that the mantle had fallen on his shoulders and had
no scruples about transferring it to those of Nicholas.</p>

<p>"You were saying, Mr. Senior," he sent an S.O.S. to Nicholas,
"that you were interested in something?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes! It was that I was saying to Mrs. Jones how fine it
was to be one of a gathering of such enthusiastic and
disinterested workers for noble causes. But sometimes I think we
take life too seriously."</p>

<p>Eva Merrywood, with her arms folded on the edge of the table,
leaned towards him. "D'you know,"&mdash;her speech was not quite
clear&mdash;"I think you're right. Lil bit o' fun
sometimes&mdash;like dancing. Haven't danced for years."</p>

<p>"Dancing! Miss Merrywood!" Arthur Muskat looked like a shocked
Silenus.</p>

<p>"Why not, Mr. Muskat?" asked Nicholas gently. "In the proper
spirit, I think dancing may be a most admirable medium for social
relaxation."</p>

<p>"My dear sir!&mdash;Wur-oop! Pardon!" as the fruit cup
intervened, "I have always learned that dancing is mos' rep-
reprehensible, Sir&mdash;most unchristian."</p>

<p>"Bunnies, Arthur! How do you know?" demanded Eva. "Did you
ever dance?"</p>

<p>"Mos' certainly not!" replied Arthur with extreme gravity.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Blomb who took up the discussion. "Then how
the..." She checked herself deftly. "I mean, how do you
know?"</p>

<p>Before Arthur could reply, Nicholas again intervened. "I
sometimes think, Mr. Muskat, that the only, way we can really
inform ourselves on these social problems is by actual
experiment." He looked meaningly at Tydvil. "Have you ever
danced, Mr. Jones?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," admitted Tydvil, "that, like Arthur, my views
are not based on experience."</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Ridgegay awoke to the trend of the discussion. "Why
not try then, just to see."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, let's all dance!" exclaimed Eva Merrywood pushing
back her chair. "Come on, Edwin, I'll show you." She grasped
Edwin Muskat's arm as much as to steady herself as to urge him to
join her.</p>

<p>"Go on, Edwin," prompted Tydvil. "What about it?" he turned to
Mrs. Blomb.</p>

<p>Eva had pulled the unwilling Edwin to feet that were not
conspicuously steady, and put her long, thin' 'arms around him.
Edwin yielded passively. Fortunately there was ample room for
manoeuvres, and it was needed. Tydvil almost choked as the
determined Eva and the reluctant Edwin began a wobbly oscillation
on their united axis, of which she was the directing force.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blomb turned in her chair, took one glance at the amazing
spectacle, and with a squeal of laughter reached for Tydvil.
"Come on, Tydvil, we'll show them how," she gasped.</p>

<p>"But I don't know how," protested Tydvil. "Aren't there steps
or something, and shouldn't we have music?"</p>

<p>"Oh, hang music! Wait, I'll show the waltz steps. Learned them
at school." She backed away. It was in the days when legs were
"limbs." Legs were seldom mentioned, and more seldom seen. But
Julia Blomb took a double reef in the mainsail, displaying a
white embroidered underskirt, six inches of red flannel petticoat
(the badge of virtue) and a considerable length of pipe stem
undercarriage terminating in large feet.</p>

<p>"Now watch," she said, poising with her right foot
pointed.</p>

<p>There was no need for the injunction to watch. Eva and Edwin
had come to a standstill by cannoning against the wall, against
which they leaned for safety. A strand of Eva's hair had worked
loose on one side, giving her a rakish and bacchanalian aspect,
and she still clung to Edwin. Arthur rose like a walrus, clutched
for the back of his chair, missed, and came down "as falls on
Mount Avernus a thunder stricken oak."</p>

<p>It was at this moment, as Mrs. Ridgegay squealed, "Go it
Julia," that Amy re-entered the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Oooh! Julia Blomb!" Then as her eyes swept round the room,
"Eva! Are you mad?"</p>

<p>"Just showing Tydvil how to waltz," announced Mrs. Blomb,
losing her balance and regaining it by a miracle.</p>

<p>"She's a scarlet woman! I saw it; scarlet!" grunted Arthur
Muskat from the floor.</p>

<p>"In my house! Dancing...?" Words again failed Amy.</p>

<p>Then her gaze turned to Nicholas, who stood surveying the
scene with an expression of pained embarrassment. "What will Mr.
Senior think?"</p>

<p>Mr. Senior left his place and advanced towards the stricken
Amy. "My dear lady, this is most distressing," he said.</p>

<p>"But what is it?" gasped Amy. "Oh, what is it? The Vicar says
his legs are paralysed. Go to him, Tydvil."</p>

<p>"I am afraid, Mrs. Jones, that it is some form of food
poisoning," said Nicholas soothingly. "Perhaps the oysters. I
have heard of this, but have never before seen the effects."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Eva and Edwin Muskat subsided slowly down the
wall until they came to rest together on the floor. Then, with a
quick move, Nicholas caught Julia Blomb and placed her in the
chair from which Tydvil had risen. Julia showed a decided
tendency to sag.</p>

<p>"Oh, we must have a doctor!" exclaimed Amy, with her hand to
her head. "I'm afraid I have it, too! My head's reeling!" So was
her body, but Tydvil rescued it manfully. Gently he lowered her
to the floor where Amy gurgled and passed out.</p>

<p>Tydvil looked round the room. Mrs. Caton Ridgegay had
disappeared&mdash;under the table.</p>

<p>He looked up at Nicholas, who regarded him with a sardonic
smile. "You?" he queried.</p>

<p>Tydvil grinned. "I'm all right. Just a bit damp round the
edges." Then, as he surveyed the battlefield, "Jove! Nicholas,
you did them proud. I wouldn't care to risk another go at that
fruit cup, though."</p>

<p>"You could," Nicholas smiled. "Try it."</p>

<p>Taking a jug and goblet from the table, Tydvil sipped the
mixture cautiously. Then his eyes met those of Nicholas with
astonishment. "Why, it's all right!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Nicholas nodded. "Exactly, so, you see, it must have been the
oysters."</p>

<p>"Of course, the oysters. That's what paralysed the vicar's
legs, too."</p>

<p>The two looked round them in silence for a moment, then
Nicholas spoke, his hands deep in his pockets. "You know, Tydvil,
I suppose there are a good many people who would think we have
not played the game, but,"&mdash;he looked distastefully at the
prone Arthur&mdash;"while I have sympathy for most human
failings, I have never been able to overcome my repugnance
against self-righteousness."</p>

<p>Tydvil nodded his understanding. "I've lived among it all my
life&mdash;I know." Then he added, "Perhaps this will do them
good."</p>

<p>Nicholas shook his head. "Not unless they know the
truth&mdash;and I'm afraid that would be difficult..."</p>

<p>"Then it must be the oysters." Then he chuckled. "There'll be
some pretty sore heads in the morning. The question is, what are
we to do with them?"</p>

<p>"I have my car," Nicholas said, "and might take some of them
if I knew where to drop them."</p>

<p>"Over the parapet of Princes Bridge would be a good place,"
laughed Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Is that an injunction or just a pious wish?" asked Nicholas
hopefully.</p>

<p>Tydvil shook his head regretfully. "I'm afraid it will have to
remain a pious wish. It might cause too much comment the other
way."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Best thing is to keep them all here for the night, there is
plenty of spare room in the house. I'll get the maids in to look
after the women&mdash;wonder what they'll think? We'll have to
give them a hand to carry them upstairs. Then we can fix up the
men ourselves."</p>

<p>"What about the morning?" Nicholas suggested.</p>

<p>"Pah! They will have forgotten most of it. Anyway, they'll
accept my explanation. Seems to me we're playing it pretty low
down on the oysters."</p>

<p>Tydvil left to summon an already perplexed and whispering
household staff, who rallied loyally to Tydvil's tale of sudden
illness. To one and all Tydvil had been a friend in need. Beds
were hastily, prepared and the stricken guests were one by one
laid to rest. It took the united efforts of Tydvil, Nicholas and
four maids before Mrs. Ridgegay was lowered on to a bed and left
to the ministrations of the maids.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room they found the Vicar, whose paralysis had
become general, lying on the hearth rug. Mrs. Claire lay on a
couch. Nicholas looked down at her. He turned to Tydvil. "The
only one of them that is worth a hoot!" he said. Then he bent
over and stroked her forehead with his long, slender fingers,
saying as he did so, "I'll see to it that she, at any rate, will
wake up without a headache."</p>

<p>It was more than an hour before a maid reported that the
invalids were all accounted for. The men had been less carefully
disposed of. Tydvil and Nicholas were seated in Tydvil's den.
There was a flicker of surprise in the girl's eyes as she saw the
cigar that Tydvil was enjoying. "Wait!" Tydvil spoke as she
turned to leave. "Emily," he said seriously, "I know you and the
others will realise how distressed I am, and Mrs. Jones will be
over this affair."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, of course, sir."</p>

<p>"Mr. Senior, who has had medical experience, is sure that
their illness has been caused by the oysters, and that they will
all be quite well in the morning."</p>

<p>"Yes sir! We hope so, sir."</p>

<p>"Still, I know you will not talk about it," Tydvil went on,
taking eight one-pound notes from his pocket. "Take one of these
yourself and give the rest to the others with my thanks."</p>

<p>The girl murmured her thanks and departed to find her
colleagues discussing the amazing happening. Because, as the
cook, indignant at the impeachment of the oysters, said, "If I
didn't know it was impossible, I'd say the lot of them were
dashed well shickered."</p>

<p>"Do you know, Nicholas," said Tydvil, as he helped his friend
into his overcoat, "I had no idea until the last few nights that
the way of transgression could be so strenuous."</p>

<p>"Don't you find it worth the effort?" asked Nicholas.</p>

<p>Tydvil smiled reminiscently. "If only for the heads that Edwin
and Arthur Muskat will have in the morning, the price is
ridiculously, inadequate."</p>

<a name="ch24"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p>It was Tydvil's fate, however, not to witness the morning
awakening of his guests. Though he, himself, awoke much later
than usual, from his personal inspection of the men, and from the
reports of the maids on the others, none of them seemed inclined
to awake, much less to get up. So Tydvil breakfasted alone,
telling the maid who attended him that he doubted if any of the
visitors would care to breakfast; but recommended that the cook
should prepare large quantities of coffee&mdash;black.</p>

<p>But it was after ten o'clock when he reached his office, a
departure from normal that Miss Brand added to her other evidence
of Tydvil's recent peculiar behaviour. She and Billy Brewer had
taken advantage of Tydvil's delayed appearance to discuss many
things, though much was purely personal; because on the third
finger of Geraldine's left hand there now flashed and sparkled a
stone that almost rivalled the light in Geraldine's eyes.</p>

<p>"But darling," Billy protested when Geraldine had repeated
Tony's account of Tydvil's movements, "Tony must be haywire."</p>

<p>"Look here, Billy," she contended, "You and I and everyone
else look on Tyddie as the best boy in the class, who always
knows his lessons, keeps his hands clean and who was never a
naughty boy in his life."</p>

<p>Billy grinned. "Portrait of a pious softgoods warehouseman by
his secretary. But that's about it. We all do."</p>

<p>"But it's not natural for a man to be as perfect as he appears
to be."</p>

<p>"For that matter, no one would believe there was such a
creature as the platypus&mdash;but there is," was Billy's
comment.</p>

<p>"Well, I doubt if Tyddie is as innocent as he seems."</p>

<p>"Oh, rats, Gerry!" laughed Billy. "You ought to know better
than anyone. Surely he has not been trying to put anything
nefarious over you."</p>

<p>"Like to see him try!" said Geraldine, straightening up. "But
really, Billy, so far as that goes I don't exist. I don't believe
he could tell you the colour of my eyes."</p>

<p>"Pooh, that's nothing! I can't either, and the good Lord knows
I've studied them closely enough these last few months. But
anyway, if a man could be with you twenty times a day for years
and still doesn't know you exist&mdash;that proves he's either
nutty or abnormal."</p>

<p>"I don't care what you say, Billy," Geraldine stuck to her
guns. "He's changed. Plenty of men have been proved pious
frauds."</p>

<p>"But, best beloved," Billy argued, "you don't mean to tell me
you think that Tyddie has suddenly taken to heaving bricks at
cops, or has gone berserk, painted the town red and then tried to
clean it up with a club. It don't make sense."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know! It does seem crazy; but why has he become such an
appalling fibber?"</p>

<p>"Aren't we all?" Billy philosophised. "Didn't one of the Old
Testament chaps say 'All men are liars'?"</p>

<p>"Speak for yourself, Billy boy! Anyway, Tyddie seems to be out
to break records."</p>

<p>"Making up for lost time, perhaps! Still, that one about his
hat being pinched at the Carlton seems a bit thick. That is, if
Tony is right."</p>

<p>"You can take it from me, Billy," Geraldine asserted, "Tony
may not he intellectual, but he is absolutely honest, and in his
job he misses nothing."</p>

<p>"Well, even if he is right, I don't see that it proves that
Tyddie has suddenly gone off the deep end to qualify for the
laurels of village reprobate."</p>

<p>"Maybe, but it does prove he has been up to some pretty steep
mischief. A man like Tyddie does not step into the witness box
and commit flat perjury unless there is something to make it
worth while."</p>

<p>"Urn," mused Billy, "don't think it's a fellow feeling, but if
he has gone a bit off the rails, I like him the better for
it."</p>

<p>"I'm as bad as you are, Billy," admitted Geraldine. "He's been
less saintly and more human these last few days."</p>

<p>"Gerry, dear," Billy became very serious, "there's something I
have to tell you. It may hurt."</p>

<p>She held out her hand to him. "I'll help! What is it,
Billy?"</p>

<p>"Cranston's issued a writ against his wife, and named me co-
re."</p>

<p>"I always did hate that man," Geraldine said with deep
conviction.</p>

<p>"I'm going to defend it, d'you mind?" He looked down at
her.</p>

<p>"Billy, dear, if I must marry a sinner, and I know you haven't
been exactly a saint, I'd sooner marry one who gets through with
his sinning before marriage."</p>

<p>"You trust me, Gerry?"</p>

<p>"There's the proof, boy!" She held up the third finger of her
left hand.</p>

<p>Billy bent forward and swept her up in his arms and the
remainder of their conversation became irrelevant, disconnected,
and, to tell the truth, just a little mushy. But that was their
business and none of ours.</p>

<p>Whether Tydvil's conscience was black, grey or spotted, he
gave no signs of that during the morning. To all who encountered
him, and especially to Geraldine, he was more genial than usual.
To Miss Brand, it seemed as though he tackled his work almost
gaily. His eyes caught the sparkle of the stone on her finger the
moment he took his chair.</p>

<p>"So!" he said, "that tonic, no, I think stimulant was the term
you used&mdash;that stimulant of yours has lost no time in
asserting his pre-emptive right. Do you believe in long
engagements, Miss Brand?"</p>

<p>Miss Brand admitted demurely that she had heard they were
unwise. The colour that rose to the creamy skin at the admission
delighted Tydvil's artistic eye.</p>

<p>"For competent secretaries I think the ideal length of an
engagement is ten years," suggested Tydvil.</p>

<p>Still keeping her eyes down a very dainty nose, Miss Brand
agreed, but added, "At the same time, Mr. Jones, as a member of
the warehouse staff, I suppose you will allow ninety-five or
ninety-seven and a half per cent discount in time."</p>

<p>"That's not business, Miss Brand," Tydvil chuckled. "That's
nothing but sheer banditry."</p>

<p>"I've always thought I'd like to be a bandit," replied
Geraldine.</p>

<p>"Do you know what I think?" asked Tydvil.</p>

<p>Geraldine raised her eyes. He was leaning back in his chair
regarding her quizzically, with his head on one side.</p>

<p>"I think," Tydvil went on, "that Geraldine Brand is a
shameless young baggage."</p>

<p>The girl laughed happily.</p>

<p>"But," he continued, "when the time comes the gift of
Craddock, Burns and Despard to the bride will be her trousseau
and her entire requirements in household linen."</p>

<p>He cut short her thanks with a laugh. "I can see that he has
been here again this morning."</p>

<p>Geraldine looked round for some trace of Billy's presence.</p>

<p>But Tydvil, still laughing, said, "Elementary, my dear Watson!
Go and look at your hair in the glass."</p>

<p>With flaming cheeks, Geraldine hurried to the mirror to repair
the disorder wrought by Billy, and Tydvil, watching her over his
shoulder, observed: "Personally, I like it that way, but should
you go out into the warehouse with it like that, someone might
obtain an entirely erroneous impression of me."</p>

<p>"Ump!" replied Geraldine Brand, with a new found audacity, as
she busied herself with her hair. "I wonder!"</p>

<p>But Geraldine would not have wondered had she been able to
follow the workings of the mind of Tydvil Jones. As the days
passed she, more than anyone else, even in the police force, was
occupied with the doings of one Basil Williams, a mysterious
roysterer who became notorious for extravagant amusements and
extravagant audacity. Basil Williams sprang into fame two nights
later when, at eleven-thirty, he, with two companions who had
dined as amply as he had, was moved to serenade the east end of
Collins Street generally.</p>

<p>Remonstrance from a constable on duty led to his referring in
approbrious terms to the constable in particular and the police
generally. When the constable found he was too strenuous a job to
handle singly, he called for assistance. One of the
reinforcements was Senior Constable O'Connor, who welcomed the
opportunity to renew an already warm acquaintance. It took five
athletic members of the force to effect the appearance of Basil
Williams at the Watch-house in Russell Street.</p>

<p>Here the captive admitted that his name was Basil Williams. He
also gave names to the Sergeant on duty that that officer did not
consider complimentary. Finally, after a strenuous ten minutes,
he was lodged in a cell with seven charges against his name in
the charge book&mdash;all of them serious.</p>

<p>That was at five minutes to midnight. Half an hour later when
the cell was opened for the admission of another guest, it was
learned with dismay that Basil Williams had vanished. All that
was left to explain his absence was a note, couched in facetious
but opprobrious terms, asking if the sergeant thought that he,
Basil Williams, were a canary to be caged in such a manner. There
was no indication that the lock on the cell door had been
tampered with. The amour propre of the police was not soothed
when they learned that the address given by Basil Williams was
that of Mrs. Julia Blomb, the well known feminist, and a leading
figure in women's political circles. Mrs. Blomb was not pleased
when she was aroused at four-thirty a.m. by a policeman who
demanded the body of one Basil Williams. It appears that she took
no pains to conceal her displeasure from her visitors.</p>

<p>The man who regretted most the absence of Mr. Williams from
his cell was the sergeant in charge of the watch-house. More so
when Senior Constable O'Connor reminded him in friendly terms of
his remarks when the former captors of the outrageous prisoner
had explained he had vanished from their gaze, also. Never did
lover sigh for a maid as that sergeant sighed for one more
glimpse of Basil Williams.</p>

<p>All the more so, when he remembered some of the epithets the
dishevelled captive had hurled at him in the presence of
subordinates, who only retained a becoming sobriety of expression
by the exercise of desperate self-constraint. If you call an
efficient and conscientious sergeant of police a drunk-robbing,
beer-soaked buzzard; a silver-striped and pop-eyed son of the
public executioner; if you assert that his appearance is more
nauseating than a bucketful of emetic, you may achieve many
things, but popularity will not be among them.</p>

<p>All these phrases had Basil Williams addressed to the
sergeant, and many more even less truthful and far more
reprehensible.</p>

<p>As Mr. Senior remarked to Basil Williams at the first
convenient opportunity, it was surprising where he learned such
expressions.</p>

<p>But Mr. Williams proudly claimed that he had not learned them
at all. He made them up as he went on. He thought it was a
gift.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the more serious bodies of the city of Melbourne
were enchanted by the advent of a new and dazzling light among
them&mdash;Mr. Nicholas Senior. His generosity was as great as
his popularity. Amy soaked herself happily in the effulgence that
shone from him. Mr. Senior's striking individuality, his
brilliant conversation, his undoubted intellectual attainments,
won him immediate recognition among the very nicest people. It
was a speech he delivered at an anti-gambling gathering, however,
that made Mr. Senior a public figure.</p>

<p>There was a Bill before the Legislative Assembly to extend the
scope of racing throughout the State. The Churches were in arms,
and a meeting was called at the town hall to protest against the
iniquitous measure. It was to be presided over by a provincial
bishop. Him, Amy invited to dinner&mdash;an intimate dinner at
which devilled oysters were not served&mdash;to meet Mr. Senior.
The bishop was so struck with his earnestness and lucid reasoning
on the evils of gambling that before coffee had made its
appearance, he had wrung a modestly reluctant promise from Mr.
Senior to speak at the meeting. The privilege of introducing his
friend was graciously conceded to Tydvil by his Lordship.</p>

<p>To the new Tydvil the privilege was one that gave him peculiar
satisfaction, and it could only have been wrested from him by
overwhelming force. To the crowded hall Tydvil announced that he
had gladly waived his intention to address the gathering in
favour of a friend whom he was proud to introduce. He did not
feel he was overstating the case when he asserted that Mr.
Nicholas Senior, from his wide experience and personal
investigations, was more familiar with the evils of gambling than
any man on earth. That view was not only his own; it was shared
by their Right Reverend Chairman.</p>

<p>The smile that Mr. Senior turned on his sponsor was born of
the knowledge that, on the previous night, Tydvil had won fifty-
four pounds from Archie Stone and two of his friends at "draw,"
and further, that most of it was in Tydvil's wallet while he was
speaking.</p>

<p>Next morning the eloquent appeal made by Mr. Nicholas Senior
was printed verbatim in all newspapers. For twenty-five minutes
he held the gathering enthralled by the magic of his quiet
persuasive eloquence. He spoke without fireworks or fulmination.
With a merciless logic he tore the Bill to pieces. With exquisite
skill he vivisected the motives of the Government and displayed
them, raw, from the platform. In swift, masterly sentences, he
portrayed the consequences that would accrue from the Bill
becoming law. When he was finished it took three stiff whiskies
to settle the nerves of an eminent member of the committee of the
Racing Club, who had dropped into the meeting for half an hour's
entertainment.</p>

<p>But the Bill was dead.</p>

<p>Said Tydvil, as he and Nicholas walked homeward after the
meeting, "But dash it all, Nicholas, what did you do it for? Why,
you almost converted me!"</p>

<p>"Policy, my friend, policy!" laughed Nicholas lightly. "Man is
naturally and ineradicably an adventurous animal. Civilisation
cramps his means of satisfaction of his hunger for adventure. Its
only escape valve is gambling. Sit on that safety valve and he
will blow up. He is bad enough when he is allowed to gamble, but
when force of any, kind is used to prevent him, my harvest is
redoubled."</p>

<p>"Well," commented Tydvil, "don't carry your reforming zeal too
far, because another speech like that and you'll close every
racecourse in the State. It's like killing the auriferous
goose."</p>

<p>"You can insure the life of that bird with perfect
confidence," grinned Nicholas.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it," responded Tydvil, "because I have not
yet seen a Melbourne Cup, and I don't want to miss the next."</p>

<p>But Nicholas had become a personage overnight. About the only
doors in the State that were not open to him were those of the
Racing Club and the Amateur Turf Club. But, as Nicholas told
Tydvil, he was sure of all the numbers of both of those
institutions for the propagation of experience and of horse, so
his exclusions from their circles did not matter.</p>

<a name="ch25"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p>There had been only one shadow on Amy's happiness&mdash;the
strange disaster that had befallen her dinner to Nicholas. But
her new friend had erased the deeper tones of that shadow during
a call he had made on her on the following afternoon. He
explained to an Amy, whose head was throbbing with what, had she
only known it, was a perfect example of hangover, that he was so
anxious about her health and that of her friends he felt it his
duty to enquire.</p>

<p>Amy explained that the worst of it was, that neither she nor
her friends could remember very much of what had happened. Was it
true, she asked, as Julia Blomb had asserted, that Eva Merrywood
had danced in an unseemly fashion with Edwin Muskat? Both Eva and
Mrs. Ridgegay denied it strenuously. But she, Amy, seemed to
remember something of the kind.</p>

<p>Mr. Senior assured her earnestly that nothing of the kind had
occurred. No doubt the insidious nature of the poison, which was
undoubtedly derived from the oysters, was responsible for
hallucinations. Similar instances were fully authenticated.</p>

<p>Amy was extremely relieved by his assurance, and she was sure
the Vicar would be, too. Poor Vicar! He was terribly troubled by
some remarks that poor dear Mrs. Claire had made&mdash;or rather
which he imagined she had made. What she could not understand,
however, was how he (Mr. Senior) had so fortunately escaped from
the trouble. Mr. Jones, also, had been marvellously
preserved.</p>

<p>Mr. Senior could only suggest that they possessed some natural
constitutional immunity from the poison.</p>

<p>But it was two days before Amy shook off the effects of her
party. She was a little annoyed, though, that both Julia Blomb
and Eva Merrywood seemed to hold her somehow responsible for the
appalling headaches from which they suffered. A little
inconsiderate and unkind, since she felt that their heads, for
throbbing anguish, could not have compared with her own.</p>

<p>However, the success of Mr. Senior as her guest, and her
triumph over Tydvil in the matter of the cheque, consoled Amy for
the minor disaster of the party. Only one thing that troubled her
was the recollection of the visit of that attractive but really
impertinent Mr. Brewer&mdash;the Mr. Brewer who should have had a
black eye but did not. That eye puzzled Amy. She was convinced
that her Mr. Brewer was the office Mr. Brewer. If that were so,
and she had but little doubt it
was&mdash;"Then&mdash;then&mdash;why had Tydvil said...?" Here
her thoughts paused. How could she tackle Tydvil on the grounds
of wilful falsehood calculated to deceive his wife, without
disclosing the unceremonious visit of Mr. Brewer? Amy felt she
had a grievance against someone, probably Tydvil, that she was
not quite in a position to air.</p>

<p>Somehow the memory of Mr. Brewer's visit dwelt in her mind. It
kept recurring at intervals. Then, one afternoon about ten days
afterwards, she felt an unaccountable urge to take a long walk.
That was most unusual, because as a rule Amy was not prone to
exercise. For a time she hesitated. Then there came the longing
for a stroll under the trees along Alexandra Avenue. There seemed
a strange fascination in walking quietly and alone through the
sunlight and shade of the wide elms and planes.</p>

<p>She dressed carefully and by a sudden impulse she put on that
new hat&mdash;it had cost five guineas&mdash;that she had bought
on the memorable afternoon of her meeting with Mr. Senior.
Standing before her mirror its chastening influence on the usual
severity of her frocking gave her a warm feeling of satisfaction.
Ordering her car she directed the chauffeur to drive into town,
but as she approached Alexandra Avenue, she changed her mind. She
commanded Carter to stop. Alighting, she said that she thought a
walk would do her good. He might return home. She would, if she
required it, take a taxi back.</p>

<p>Carter, whose love and respect for Amy might have been
represented by minus signs, wondered, in very unseemly thoughts,
what the dashed hen-wowser was up to. Registering an impious hope
that she would drown herself in the river, he drove away.</p>

<p>Amy turned away and walked slowly along the avenue towards the
Botanic Gardens. She had not been there for years, and determined
to make them her objective. With her bag held loosely under her
arm, she strolled along the tan path, wondering vaguely why she
had not recognised the pleasure of pedestrian exercise
earlier.</p>

<p>Suddenly her reverie was shattered by violence.</p>

<p>A man who had approached her from the opposite direction,
suddenly lurched against her with his shoulder. As he did so, he
grabbed at the handbag beneath her arm. Almost off her balance,
Amy was unable to protect her property except by screaming. This
she did in a manner that would have done credit to a
locomotive.</p>

<p>Turning as she squealed, she saw the flight of the thief
arrested by a tall athletic figure. There was a brief scuffle,
from which emerged a clean and nicely placed uppercut to the jaw
of her assailant, who lapsed supine into instant oblivion. The
tall figure stooped and retrieved Amy's property, which not worth
anything like the punch in the jaw that was the bag-snatcher's
sole reward for his enterprise. Its contents were a tube of
peppermints and a handkerchief.</p>

<p>The tall figure stood beside his captive awaiting the now
silent Amy's approach. The recognition was mutual and
astonished.</p>

<p>"Mr. Brewer!" exclaimed Amy.</p>

<p>"Why! It is Mrs. Jones!" gasped Mr. Brewer.</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know how to thank you, Mr. Brewer." Amy was
really somewhat upset by the suddenness of the attack.</p>

<p>"Of course, I'm only too delighted to be of any service, Mrs.
Jones," William replied. "It was providential that I happened to
see this scoundrel attack you." He looked down at the upturned
face of the malefactor, which was showing signs of a return to
the realisation of earthly things. "I'll wait here and try to get
a lift from someone, and take this brute to the watch-house."</p>

<p>Amy glanced down at the unpleasant spectacle. Inwardly she
thought gaol was too good for him, but she was Amy, and
magnanimity was her long suit at the moment. "Poor creature!" she
sighed. "Perhaps he has a mother! Please give him his liberty,
Mr. Brewer."</p>

<p>William bent over and jerked the deadbeat to his feet by the
scruff of his neck. "I'm afraid your heart is too kind, Mrs.
Jones," he protested, "but, of course, your wishes are law to
me." There was a gallant deference in his voice. "Still, I think
some punishment is indicated. Will you kindly look the other way
for a moment."</p>

<p>"Oh! Please, Mr. Brewer, don't hurt him, too much," murmured
Amy, inwardly wishing that Mr. Brewer would not take her plea for
mercy too seriously.</p>

<p>As she turned away, Billy thrust a one pound note into the
hand of the culprit. Then, with a scowling face, he swung the
bewildered man round, and administered a hearty kick where it
would do him the most moral good and the least physical harm. It
was a very astonished bag-snatcher who moved with unwonted speed
towards Princes Bridge, wondering at an inconsistency which could
reward and punish so liberally.</p>

<p>Billy turned to Amy, gravely solicitous about the shock she
had received. He begged that she would permit him to see her to
the kiosk in the gardens and give her a cup of tea.</p>

<p>After a little hesitation, Amy allowed herself to be
persuaded. She felt a warm glow at the flattery in his respectful
but earnest consideration for her well being. As they passed
through the gate into the gardens, she said, "You know, Mr.
Brewer, I am really afraid that I should not have allowed you to
persuade me. Your behaviour was so very unceremonious on our last
encounter."</p>

<p>Mr. Brewer hung his head and murmured a humble apology for his
unpardonable presumption, and begged her forgiveness.</p>

<p>"I don't think I should forgive you." Her smile belied her
words. "I cannot think what prompted you."</p>

<p>Greatly daring, Mr. Brewer said, "Please, Mrs. Jones, don't
force me to tell you. I know I ought to be ashamed of myself, but
I couldn't help it, you looked so..." His pause invited her
curiosity.</p>

<p>"So what? Mr. Brewer," Amy insisted gently.</p>

<p>"Lovely," breathed the wicked Mr. Brewer.</p>

<p>"Mr. Brewer...!" Amy's heart danced as it certainly should not
have danced. "You must never, never say anything like that to me
again." She tried hard, but the shocked rebuke she intended to
convey somehow fell short or missed its mark.</p>

<p>"I promise I will try not to," conceded the graceless but
graceful Mr. Brewer.</p>

<p>Amy accepted the compromise.</p>

<p>At the kiosk Mr. Brewer fussed assiduously over Mrs. Jones's
tea and comfort. When they were settled, Mr. Brewer's cheery talk
made Amy feel they were almost old friends. They fed the sparrows
with their crumbs and then dropped into friendly discourse on
"ships and shoes and sealing wax." And when Mr. Brewer assured
Mrs. Jones that he almost felt grateful to the bag-snatcher for
the pleasure of their meeting, she allowed the admiration in his
voice and eyes to pass without rebuke.</p>

<p>Indeed, time passed so swiftly, that Amy was astonished to
find that it was half past five and they had been together for
nearly three happy, hours. 'As she arose, Mr. Brewer expressed a
deftly modulated regret that such afternoons could not be
repeated.</p>

<p>"Would it not be possible...?" He stopped as though
embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Would what be possible?" She smiled encouragement. "To have
tea here again," dared Mr. Brewer.</p>

<p>Amy really hesitated this time. But she hesitated. Mr. Brewer
urged with respectful warmth.</p>

<p>Amy murmured, "Well, only once more. Once, mind&mdash;Mr.
Brewer."</p>

<p>"Next Wednesday" Mr. Brewer pleaded.</p>

<p>"No. Thursday." Amy felt she should not make things too easy
for Mr. Brewer.</p>

<p>Forbidding him to accompany her, Amy made for the river
gate.</p>

<p>Now there is little in this rather dull encounter, in itself,
to make it worth recording. But there were two circumstances that
made the meeting memorable.</p>

<p>The first, and most important, was that while Mr. Brewer and
Amy were enjoying their tea at the Kiosk in the Botanic Gardens,
Mr. Billy Brewer was also going about the business of Craddock,
Burns and Despard in the city. Moreover, at the time Mrs. Jones
and Mr. Brewer were leavetaking, Billy Brewer was perched on the
corner of Geraldine Brand's writing table exchanging lively and
airy persiflage with his fiancee, while awaiting the arrival of
Tydvil Jones, who, Geraldine assured him, had been absent all the
afternoon. Explain them as you may, but the circumstances were as
related.</p>

<p>The second circumstance that marked the meeting of Amy and Mr.
Brewer was that at dinner that night, Amy said nothing to Tydvil
about the bag-snatcher and less about her meeting with Mr.
Brewer. Indeed, without actually committing herself to an
untruth, Amy led Tydvil to believe that she had spent the
afternoon at the office of the Moral Uplift Society.</p>

<p>It was rather remarkable, too, that Tydvil accepted her
implied movements without question; but Amy would have been
staggered had she been endowed with the gift of reading his
thoughts. These were uncomplimentary, amused, and ribald.</p>

<p>Fortunately, too, for Amy's peace of mind, she was spared the
knowledge of the discussion of her afternoon's encounter between
Nicholas Senior and the notorious Basil Williams. With his hat at
a rakish angle and a cigar in the corner of his mouth, Basil
Williams sat on the edge of Tydvil's writing table, swinging his
legs as he spoke.</p>

<p>"It worked perfectly, Nicholas," he said. "You timed
everything to the moment. But, why didn't you tell me you had
planned the bag-snatching episode?"</p>

<p>"Better to have it spontaneous," Nicholas chuckled. "Your
gallant intervention would have carried conviction to any woman's
heart."</p>

<p>"Really," Basil Williams smiled with inward satisfaction, "I
felt quite proud of that upper cut. But it was pretty rough on
the bag-snatcher you selected for this job."</p>

<p>"I agree heartily," replied Nicholas, rubbing his jaw softly.
"I deserved the pound note you gave me, but you might have spared
me the parting benediction. You kick like a war horse."</p>

<p>"You?" exclaimed Basil Williams in a startled enquiry. Mr.
Senior nodded his affirmation. "Personal supervision is essential
in delicate plans such as yours."</p>

<p>"Oh! By Jove! I'm sorry," Basil said contritely. "I never
dreamed..."</p>

<p>Nicholas waved aside the apology airily. "Don't worry. I'm
inclined to think you'll get even a greater kick out of, the
affair than I did."</p>

<p>"You know," Basil Williams remarked thoughtfully, "it's a
queer thing that a man can be married to a woman for years and
know so little about her."</p>

<p>"Umph!" chuckled Nicholas, "a recognition of the fact is the
beginning of wisdom in a married man." Then he went on in a
reminiscent tone, "Listen, my friend. Since the day I met Eve, I
have met and known millions and millions of women. Women have
sent me millions of men, and I have heard their stories. Millions
of women have come to me of their own accord, and I have heard
their stories..." he paused a moment, and added, "and I have
never believed one of them. I have studied women intensively, I
have studied them derisively, and I have studied them seriously.
But Tydvil, believe me, I know I am no nearer to an understanding
of them than when I began."</p>

<p>"And so?" Tydvil queried, as he paused.</p>

<p>"I'm a bachelor." Nicholas shook his head slowly. "Aye, my
friend, that is the sole grain of wisdom I have garnered from my
studies. Of knowledge, they brought me nothing."</p>

<p>"Then!" exclaimed Tydvil&mdash;Basil Williams "if you can't
understand 'em, how the heck can we be expected to know anything
about 'em."</p>

<p>Nicholas shrugged his shoulders. "One of the Divine mysteries.
The book is sealed to me and mine and man."</p>

<p>For a while they smoked in silence, then Tydvil asked
tentatively, "Do you think they understand themselves?"</p>

<p>Nicholas laughed shortly. "Completely&mdash;as completely as
they understand men. And a major feature of their
incomprehensibility is their brazen pose of not understanding
themselves. I'll tell you something I have never admitted to
anyone else. Since men walked on earth no man has been able to
fool me for a minute. But, Tydvil, it makes me blush all over to
remember how often women have deceived me&mdash;me! Mind you, I
have learned from sore experience never to trust one of them for
a moment. I am always on my guard. But over and over again some
insinuating white skinful of guile has snatched a man, who was
absolutely mine, right out of my very hands. Pha!"</p>

<p>"I understand your feelings," said Tydvil sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Ah, well," Nicholas sighed. "I suppose it evens itself. I
have the statistics and find that, year in and year out, they
send me as many men as they cheat me of. I ought to think myself
lucky it's no worse."</p>

<p>There was another silence that was broken by a laugh from
Nicholas. "That reminds me," he said, "I had a very pressing
offer of two policemen from your friend Julia Blomb the other
morning. Your doing," he added.</p>

<p>"How?" demanded Tydvil.</p>

<p>"You gave her address as that of Basil Williams to the police.
They got her out of bed before daylight, searching for you. She
wound up a five minutes' oration by consigning the two victims in
particular to me, together with the entire force generally, from
boots to helmet."</p>

<p>"Wish I'd been there," smiled Tydvil happily.</p>

<p>"Since then," Nicholas continued, "she has written to the
Chief Secretary&mdash;that woman has a stirring literary style,
and a gift for invective&mdash;and he passed his tribulation
along to the Commissioner of Police, with annotations and caustic
decorations."</p>

<p>"There's gratitude," grinned Tydvil. "I voted for that man
last election."</p>

<p>"I am only telling you this," went on Nicholas, "to remind you
that Basil Williams is not very popular with the police force at
the moment."</p>

<p>"And that, after all the publicity I am getting for them,"
said Tydvil in an injured tone. "Did you notice those letters in
the papers this morning about my escape from custody, and police
inefficiency?"</p>

<p>Nicholas nodded. "It may interest you to know that the
Commissioner has also passed on the ukase, even more emphatically
than the Chief Secretary, that Basil Williams must be
recaptured."</p>

<p>"Poor chaps! They didn't need bawling out on my account. I'll
bet every one of them, from the Sergeant at the watchhouse down,
is more anxious to get hold of me than the Chief Secretary or the
Commissioner."</p>

<p>"Precisely!" Nicholas nodded. "At the present time there are
fifty large and angry men raging through the streets and night
resorts, all with the one thought in their minds. The sermon the
Commissioner preached to a special parade has hurt their
feelings."</p>

<p>"That makes it rather awkward," said Tydvil reflectively. "I
was promising myself a treat for this evening."</p>

<p>"Now what?" There was amused interest in the
interrogation.</p>

<p>"Well, you see," Tydvil explained, "it's the night of the
monthly meeting of the Committee of the Society for the
Suppression of Alcohol, and I was thinking..." He hesitated.</p>

<p>"Go on," prompted Nicholas. "Let's have it!"</p>

<p>"Well, I was thinking how pleasant it would be to meet Edwin
Muskat in the street after the meeting and punch his
nose&mdash;just once." Tydvil hastened to add.</p>

<p>"Puerile, but pardonable," Nicholas smiled.</p>

<p>"I know it's puerile," Tydvil pleaded. "But remember,
Nicholas, I never had a chance before of being a boy, and
besides, that nose is begging to be punched."</p>

<p>"Looked at in the light of a pious duty, the project is
excusable," Nicholas conceded. "I hold no brief for that nose,
believe me. It only occurs to me that with all those plain-
clothes and uniformed men at short call, Edwin Muskat's might not
be the only nose to be wrecked this fine night. Think it
over."</p>

<p>"No!" Tydvil's voice took on a ring of determination. "Hear
me, Nicholas!" He declaimed:</p>

<pre>Breathes there a man with soul so dead, Who never to himself
hath said, I'll punch that nose till it runs red. </pre>

<p>"Two of those lines are by a patriotic poet named Scott. The
last and, and I think, the best, is my own."</p>

<p>"The sentiments are admirable," Nicholas agreed. "But I
suggest you adopt another individuality for your pilgrimage."</p>

<p>"Never!" exclaimed Tydvil defiantly. "I am proud of Basil
Williams, and I will fight under no other or lesser banner."</p>

<p>Nicholas looked up at Basil Williams from his armchair
reflectively. "Do you know, Tydvil," he said, "for a man of your
cloistered upbringing, your capacity and appetite for lawlessness
are most refreshing. From your past record I did not think you
had it in you. And I am not easily surprised."</p>

<p>"Cloistered upbringing is right," sniffed Tydvil. "Jove!
Nicholas, can you realise what it means to me to cut loose? From
the day I was born till the day we met, I have been ruled by a
despotism of Don'ts&mdash;Women's Don'ts at that. You're right!
It is puerile to go out and sock Muskat on the nose. But if I had
had a normal boyhood I would have been able to slam him on the
jaw when we were both kids, and we both would have made better
men for it. Now I have to get it out of my system as a man.
Lawless is right!" Then he went on, "Believe it or not, but if a
cop or two should show up, I'll feel better for having a turn up
with them."</p>

<p>"It looks as though I am in for a busy night," was Nicholas's
comment.</p>

<p>"One thing," Tydvil protested as he slipped off his perch on
the table. "I don't want you to dry nurse me this time. You
needn't trouble to keep my friends off the track. I'm willing to
take the risks."</p>

<p>"The risks will be there, my friend," warned Nicholas. "The
sergeant has offered a reward of five dozen of beer for the man
who brings you in. He's in a vindictive mood."</p>

<p>"Let 'em all come," Tydvil replied. "You see, Nicholas,
swatting Edwin Muskat's nose, per se, will provide more
satisfaction than excitement. Dodging the cops, if any, will add
the essential ginger."</p>

<p>"Good!" laughed Nicholas. "I will adopt a policy of strict
neutrality."</p>

<p>"I want to see if I cannot pull through without help," said
Tydvil as he turned to the door. "I won't call on you unless I am
in extremis. The meeting should be nearly over by now."</p>

<p>Although Basil Williams was determined, he was by no means
reckless. From the entrance to the warehouse he made a careful
reconnaissance of Flinders Lane before he stepped on to the
footpath. Then he turned west towards Queen Street keeping well
in the shadow, but carefully avoiding any appearance of stealth.
He knew that, though the search would be mainly confined to the
east side of Elizabeth Street, Basil Williams was not safe
anywhere in the Metropolitan Area that night. Still, the almost
deserted business side of the city offered the best protection.
Its devotion to high finance and high buildings provided no
attraction for roysterers.</p>

<p>Twice, before he reached Queen Street, he blessed the system
that put the police in shiny helmets from which the street lights
gleamed, and made them a beacon for evil doers to avoid. Each
time he had sufficient notice in which to pull himself together
and pass the danger spot with serene and unhurried stride that
disarmed suspicion.</p>

<p>Turning into Queen Street, he crossed Collins Street, where he
slackened his pace and carefully observed a building on the
opposite side of the street near Little Collins, Street. In three
windows on the third floor, lights were burning. Basil Williams
stepped into the shadow of a convenient doorway, and waited.
During the ten minutes he waited, speculating on the ownership of
two cars parked across the road, not more than three people
passed his shelter. Then a policeman on his beat went by in
measured dignity towards, Bourke Street. Basil Williams breathed
a blessing on him as he crossed Little Collins Street, as the
lights he was watching on the third floor opposite vanished.</p>

<p>Two minutes later from the door of the building opposite a
group of people stepped into Queen Street. As they did Basil
Williams moved from his lair and crossed the wide thoroughfare.
The group, which consisted of five men and two women, the
Executive Committee of the Society for the Suppression of
Alcohol, paused to say their farewells before separating. One of
the women was Mrs. Tydvil Jones, whom Basil Williams did not
expect to see there because of the absence of her car. More so,
as at breakfast that morning, she had expressed her intention of
not attending the meeting. He was unaware that her colleague,
Mrs. Farley, had picked her up at the last moment, as the meeting
threatened to lapse for want of a quorum.</p>

<p>Her presence added to the joy in the heart of Basil Williams
as he approached the group. A swift glance in either direction
showed him that Queen Street was empty of all but himself and the
Committee, except for a man standing on the corner of Bourke
Street, about one hundred yards away. Every member of the
committee was an old and unvalued friend. The more he saw of them
the less he valued their acquaintance, until his esteem for them
had almost reached vanishing point.</p>

<p>The chattering group became silent as a large stranger joined
it. Basil Williams raised his hat courteously and enquired, "May
I ask if one of you gentlemen is Mr. Edwin Muskat?"</p>

<p>"That is my name," replied the secretary for the Society for
the Suppression of Alcohol, with an oily smile.</p>

<p>"I have been keeping something for you for a long, long time,
Mr. Muskat," said the stranger with deceptive gentleness, "and
this is my first opportunity to hand it over."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" replied the now deeply interested Edwin. "That is
very pleasant of you, sir. I will be glad to receive your
gift."</p>

<p>"I sincerely trust and hope you benefit from it." The voice of
the stranger was still very gentle. "Here it is."</p>

<p>Wham!!!</p>

<p>Basil Williams had withdrawn half a pace as he spoke. The
distance and direction of his aim were calculated with loving
fidelity. It was more than fifteen minutes before Edwin Muskat
returned to a knowledge of things mundane. When he did the
throbbing anguish of a devastated proboscis made him wish, very
heartily, that he could lapse into unconsciousness again.</p>

<p>But during that fifteen minutes things had been happening
things that Edwin Muskat would have deplored deeply, but things
which one less regenerate than he would have enjoyed
immensely.</p>

<p>For a few brief seconds Mr. Muskat's six colleagues stared
uncomprehending at the collapsed form on the pavement. For the
moment they were, although on their feet, as stunned as Edwin
Muskat. It was Mrs. Farley who first recovered from the trance.
Through her dizzy brain arose to the surface the thought that the
occasion demanded screaming. So she screamed. Mrs. Farley had a
good screaming voice, and the sounds she emitted, confined in the
high-walled canyon of the empty street, were of a good 500 parrot
power.</p>

<p>Amy's contribution was, "Oh! You&mdash;you&mdash;horrid
brute!"</p>

<p>What was of more interest to Basil Williams, however, was the
"Infernal scoundrel!" from one member of the committee as he
flung himself on the assailant with intent to do grievous bodily
harm. Spurred on by his example, the other three barged in,
fortunately getting very much in one another's way.</p>

<p>Four very unathletic men, unpractised in street brawling
would, in ordinary circumstances, have been small odds against
Basil Williams. But he had noted that the figure at the corner of
Bourke Street was bearing down on the scene at speed that
suggested both youth, strength and endurance. It was for this
reason, and somewhat against his better feelings, that he was
obliged to deal swiftly, and in a highly unorthodox manner with
the four old and unvalued friends of Tydvil Jones. He reinforced
his lashing right and left fists with knee action that would have
ensured his disqualification for life from any, boxing stadium.
In as many seconds he had skittled his four opponents across the
pavement. Then he turned and departed&mdash;in haste.</p>

<p>There was good cause for his haste.</p>

<p>Mrs. Farley's vocal efforts continued unabated and had drawn
several more figures from Bourke Street, as well as two from
Collins Street. Basil Williams's suspicion that the man on the
corner was a plain-clothes constable was only too well grounded.
Already he had covered half the distance and was a bare fifty
yards behind when Basil's flight began, while his one-track mind
made him disregard totally the shrieking woman and the sprawled
group on the footpath to concentrate on the pursuit.</p>

<p>Basil Williams thought as swiftly as he moved. As he met the
two men running towards him from Collins Street he pulled up and
panted. "Man murdered&mdash;hurry&mdash;I'm running for the
police." He ducked on, and the two night prowlers increased their
pace in a lively curiosity to be among the first to inspect the
corpse.</p>

<p>Luck he did not deserve saw Basil Williams safely across
Collins Street, but here it deserted him. Two uniformed men,
attracted by Mrs. Farley's high C's, and who glimpsed the flying
figure from Collins Street, sprang into action. They rounded the
corner into Queen Street only a few yards ahead of the plain-
clothes man, and little more than twenty yards behind Basil
Williams. One shouted a peremptory command to halt&mdash;a
command which the fugitive was in no mood to obey. Basil thought
he was moving on top gear at the moment, but he almost redoubled
his pace when he heard behind him the vicious report of a
revolver and instantaneously beside him, the more vicious pin-n-g
of a bullet striking the pavement.</p>

<p>His long association with Flinders Lane had given Tydvil Jones
an intimate knowledge of the less known geography of the
locality. All its side lanes, dead ends, and bolt holes were
clear in his mind; and well they served Basil Williams in his
hour of tribulation. Nevertheless, he swore fluently and
wholeheartedly when he recognised that the knowledge of his
pursuers was equal to his own.</p>

<p>By desperate and devious windings he finally reached Elizabeth
Street, crossing in a flash under the nose of a tram, and
expecting every moment to hear another shot from behind him,
where he knew his pursuers now numbered eight or ten. The risk he
had taken with the tram gave him a few yards extra margin. He
darted up Flinders Lane in the hope of reaching the
warehouse.</p>

<p>Then fell calamity.</p>

<p>Not more than twenty feet from the corner he charged fairly
into Senior Constable O'Connor. The recognition was mutual. Basil
Williams had a split second in which to draw up and execute a
tactical plan. He slugged mightily with his left and kicked
simultaneously with a hearty right foot. The two came down in a
heap on the narrow footpath. Senior Constable O'Connor reached
out a purposeful hand for the wriggling Basil Williams, who
promptly bit it vigorously.</p>

<p>The constable spat out a three-word character sketch of Basil
Williams that could not be printed even in these liberal
days.</p>

<p>Basil was on his feet before the last word was uttered, and,
aiming a hearty kick at the ribs of the half risen O'Connor, sped
on his way. But the game was nearly up, and so were O'Connor and
the rest of the hard-bitten crew of pursuers. Basil Williams felt
his legs were losing their spring while those of O'Connor at
least were fresh, and were also spurred on with not unrighteous
wrath.</p>

<p>As he swung into the Centreway with the leading hound not
twenty feet behind him he gasped out an appeal to Nicholas. As he
did so he tripped and fell. The next instant his pursuers were
round the corner and on him.</p>

<p>Lying face down as he had fallen, he heard the chase stop
beside him.</p>

<p>Then came a voice&mdash;an astonished voice: "Cripes! This
isn't the bloke we were after."</p>

<p>Enlightenment and gratitude flashed into Tydvil's mind.</p>

<p>Not unkindly hands turned him face up. He kept his eyes closed
and assumed an expression that he hoped would register pain.</p>

<p>Then came another and solicitous voice: "By Jove! It's Mr.
Tydvil Jones. That swine must have knocked him out."</p>

<p>A strong arm went under his shoulder and raised him up.
Tydvil's dazed eyes looked up into the face of Senior Constable
O'Connor.</p>

<p>"What happened, sir?" asked O'Connor.</p>

<p>Tydvil's pause before answering was deftly prolonged. Then he
gasped weakly, "I was just returning to my office when a tall man
turned the corner. He struck me in the chest&mdash;I..."</p>

<p>Anxious voices cut him short. "Which way did he go?"</p>

<p>"Straight on I think," replied Tydvil, still weakly, "at
least, I suppose so."</p>

<p>The group of men looked from Tydvil along towards Collins
Street. The Centreway was manifestly empty but for the group
round Tydvil, who was making shaken attempts to get on his feet.
Three or four ran along to the side lane and reported it
empty.</p>

<p>"Got clean away!" snorted one of the uniformed men. "Wonder
who he was?"</p>

<p>Senior Constable O'Connor, who had helped Tydvil to his feet,
glared round the group. "In case you'd like to know, it was that
so-and-so, Basil Williams&mdash;and," he added, "he's done us
again."</p>

<p>He turned again to Tydvil. "Do you think, sir, you could
recognise that man again?"</p>

<p>Tydvil shook his head doubtfully. "You see, constable," he
said, "it was all so dreadfully sudden. I scarcely caught a
glimpse of him. All I remember is that he was taller than I, and
that he was wearing a dark double-breasted suit. Probably blue
serge."</p>

<p>Tydvil, himself, was wearing a single-breasted grey worsted,
for which he inwardly and piously thanked his luck.</p>

<p>Senior Constable O'Connor, who was engaged in tying a
handkerchief round a bleeding wound on the edge of his palm,
expressed sympathy for the shaking Mr. Jones had received, and
promised that in the near future he would settle all outstanding
accounts with Basil Williams. His offer to assist Mr. Jones as
far as his office was accepted gratefully and courteously.</p>

<p>Beyond what the plain-clothes man could tell, that there had
been the deuce of a brawl in Queen Street, the cause and extent
of which he was unaware, none of the pursuing group could inform
Mr. Jones of the earlier activities of the now notorious Basil
Williams.</p>

<p>Parting from O'Connor at the warehouse, Tydvil rang for a taxi
in which he reached home, he was glad to learn, before Amy. For
reasons particularly his own, Tydvil went to bed immediately.</p>

<p>Next morning he delayed his breakfast while he searched two
morning papers. Both gave lurid, but varied and not altogether
accurate accounts of the dastardly assault on Mr. Edwin Muskat by
a man who was undoubtedly, Basil Williams. Amy's name was
conspicuous among those present. Neither paper referred to his
own mishap.</p>

<p>By the time Amy arrived at the breakfast table, almost
bursting with the story of her night's adventure, Tydvil was
prepared to nip her narrative in the bud. He received her formal
"Good morning, Tydvil dear," with an icy stare. Then, in shocked
surprise, he told her that her name was blazoned in the papers in
connection with some very disreputable brawl in which Edwin
Muskat was concerned, also.</p>

<p>"Of course, Amy, I acquit you of personal blame," he said
coldly, "but I do think, considering our standing in the
community, that you have been indiscreet, and that such a
deplorable association could have been avoided."</p>

<p>Amy almost choked under the attack. "Don't you understand,
Tydvil, that the assault on Edwin Muskat was cowardly and utterly
unprovoked," she protested.</p>

<p>"Amy," he asked in a pained voice, "do you mean to tell me
that a perfect stranger walked up to Edwin Muskat and struck him
violently in the face, and without provocation?"</p>

<p>"That's just what happened, Tydvil," she snapped.</p>

<p>Tydvil's lips assumed a severe judicial line as he looked
coldly at his wife. "Of course, Amy, I must accept your
explanation. I hope other people will be as generous to you."</p>

<p>"But..." He waved aside her further explanation with an airy
gesture.</p>

<p>"I am very much afraid, my dear, you will find that most
people will assume that Edwin Muskat, or someone on the scene,
must have given some cause for offence. Men do not commit such
assaults as the whim of a moment." He stood up and walked to the
door. "I would rather not discuss the matter further," he said,
turning round, "but you may rely upon me to support your version
of the fracas loyally."</p>

<p>He departed as one who has sacrificed the principles of a
lifetime to save the honour of his house. Amy stared after him,
hot under the injustice of his aspersions and innuendoes, but
feeling helpless to retaliate. By some unaccountable means,
Tydvil had deprived her of her prerogative of rebuke. She
recognised also, that, for the second time, he had defeated her
in a breakfast-battle.</p>

<a name="ch26"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p>That morning Geraldine Brand entered the portals of C. B.
&amp; D. a very pre-occupied young woman. She had left her home
somewhat troubled that the case of Cranston v. Cranston, Brewer
Co-Respondent, had been listed for hearing sooner than she or
Billy had anticipated. Though she was concerned more with the
possible unpleasant publicity than with the outcome of the
case.</p>

<p>Billy, however, was driven completely into the background of
her thoughts when, in the train on her journey to the city, she
read an account of Basil Williams's activities of the previous
evening. Her's was a morning paper that Tydvil had not seen. In
addition to the story of the dastardly assault on Mr. Edwin
Muskat, whose nose was, fortunately, not broken, but very
painfully injured; her paper also told of a cowardly attack on
Mr. Tydvil Jones, the well known merchant and philanthropist.</p>

<p>Geraldine's head was buzzing with mixed surmises and
preposterous ideas as she walked through the warehouse. She was
too absorbed to notice her surroundings until, passing through
the railed enclosure, she found the door of the office of the
well known merchant and philanthropist closed. This was unusual,
because by her orders to the office cleaners it, and the windows,
were always left open until her arrival.</p>

<p>She opened the door, took one step across the threshold and
stood motionless, sniffing fastidiously at a close atmosphere
that was saturated with the odour of stale cigar smoke. As she
sniffed, her eyes took in every detail of untidiness that denoted
the room had been untouched by the cleaner. The char-lady, she
learned later in the day, was suffering from influenza.</p>

<p>Swiftly she crossed the floor, let up the blind and raised the
heavy window; not until she had removed her hat and tidied her
hair did she make a closer and methodical survey of the room.
Never did Sherlock Holmes examine cigar ash, that liberally
sprinkled the carpet, so scrupulously as did Geraldine Brand. The
carpet also yielded two gorgeous cigar bands, and the waste-paper
basket two more. For some moments she examined from a respectful
distance one cigar butt in the grate and three in the fender.
These, presently, she placed with reluctant fingers into an
envelope which she sealed, and then, still more reluctantly,
placed in her handbag.</p>

<p>Two tumblers beside the water bottle on the table next
attracted her attention. Geraldine raised them to her nose and
sniffed each one. Then she said aloud, "Well! I'm blessed!" Since
the drains of fluid in the tumblers smelt strongly of whisky it
was only logical to assume that the tumblers had been filled and
had been emptied. There was no evidence to suggest they had been
emptied on the floor.</p>

<p>Then for nearly fifteen minutes Geraldine worked vigorously to
obliterate all traces of proceeding foreign to the known
abstemious habits of Mr. Tydvil Jones. By the time she had
finished and busied herself with her mail, the room and the
atmosphere were restored to their normal ascetic purity.</p>

<p>But Geraldine's mind, as her hands worked swiftly over the
correspondence of C. B. &amp; D., was anything but normal. She
had secured what she believed to be presumptive evidence that the
impeccable Tydvil Jones not only smoked, but drank. Therefore,
obviously, Tyddie was a fraud. But these were minor matters. Her
mental perturbation was reflected in the viciousness with which
she slashed the envelopes as she tried to arrive at the identity
of Tyddie's drinking and smoking companion. He may have smoked
four cigars, but, even he, was unlikely to have used two tumblers
for his potations.</p>

<p>But the major problem was the inexplicable relationship
between Tyddie and the movements of Basil Williams. It might have
been coincidence that prompted Basil Williams to take Tyddie's
hat from the Carlton&mdash;if he did take it, which Geraldine
very much doubted. But, thought Geraldine, what kind of
coincidence was it that led Basil Williams, after assaulting
Edwin Muskat in Queen Street, to commit another assault on Tydvil
Jones close to his own warehouse? Summed up, that would make two
highly improbable coincidences. In trying to fit together the
pieces of the puzzle, Geraldine was inclining to the view that
Basil Williams was Tyddie's unofficial guest.</p>

<p>What then?</p>

<p>After all, Tyddie's morals were not her affair, she reflected.
Still, if Williams were Tyddie's secret partner in sin, why
should he knock Tyddie out? As a figure of rectitude, Tyddie was
tottering on his pedestal. But Geraldine decided that her
discoveries were part of her job as his secretary, and therefore
sacrosanct, even from Billy. No! Decidedly, she could not tell
Billy either of her discoveries or her conclusions&mdash;not yet,
at any rate.</p>

<p>So, when that eminent warehouseman and well known
philanthropist, Tydvil Jones, breezed into his office with a
cheerful "Good morning, Miss Brand," that suspicious young woman,
while responding politely, inspected her employer with very
critical eyes. Certainly, she thought, Tyddie did not look like a
reprobate, but there was something about him that made him
different from the Tyddie of but a few weeks gone.</p>

<p>She stared reflectively at the straight back as he hung up his
hat, and through her lashes she took him in as he seated himself
on the opposite side of the table. Then sudden enlightenment came
to her. The new Tyddie radiated that same something of confidence
and experience that was part of Billy Brewer's charm. So had
Billy, looked when she knew he had been in mischief, and had
enjoyed it. She recognised the symptoms with that infallible
certainty of intuition with which Providence has endowed woman
for the better ordering of man.</p>

<p>As Tydvil settled himself, she looked up and said with grave
concern, "Oh! Mr. Jones, I do hope you are none the worse for
that disagreeable experience of last night."</p>

<p>Tydvil, who, knowing two papers had overlooked his share in
the Basil Williams episode, concealed his surprise admirably. But
not admirably enough to escape the steady grey eyes across the
table. Swiftly recognising her knowledge and its probable source,
he replied, "It was really nothing to make a fuss about, Miss
Brand. The papers have exaggerated a trifling incident. A man,
who was probably intoxicated, ran into me and knocked me down. I
think the poor creature was unaware that he struck me."</p>

<p>"Fibber!" breathed Geraldine silently to her blotting pad.
Then, aloud, "But is it not strange that it was that awful man
Williams who assaulted you?"</p>

<p>"Williams?" The studied incomprehension was too well done.</p>

<p>"Yes, Williams. The same man who took your hat from the
Carlton that night. The brute that the police are hunting for."
The innocent looking eyes were full of sympathy that she did not
feel.</p>

<p>"Really? Was it the same man? I had almost forgotten him."
Tydvil's voice expressed mild interest only.</p>

<p>"Liar!" retorted Geraldine in her heart. But there was no
trace of her unbelief in her voice as she went on. "It seemed to
me such a strange coincidence that on two occasions your name, of
all people's, should be associated, even remotely, with that of
such an awful creature."</p>

<p>Tydvil took the letters she passed across to him, and as he
unfolded the first, he shook his head and smiled gently. "Ah! My
dear Miss Brand, we do not know enough about that poor fellow to
judge him hastily." The old sanctimonious Tydvil was speaking.
"Perhaps if we knew the truth we would find he was more sinned
against than sinning. Let us be charitable."</p>

<p>"Hypocrite!" hissed Geraldine to her inner self. Then, with a
toss of the shining head, she came back, "Well, in that case, all
I can say is, that if half what the papers say about him is true,
he must be frightfully sinned against."</p>

<p>Tydvil looked at her reflectively, and remarked, "In
considering such cases, Miss Brand, I always say to myself,
'There, but for the Grace of God, goes Tydvil Jones!'" He bent
over his letter with a pencil in his hand.</p>

<p>For days past Geraldine had been manufacturing a bomb for
Tyddie's sole benefit. Now she landed it on the bent head, where
it exploded. "I feel strongly, Mr. Jones, because I can't help
thinking that, somehow, this man Williams was responsible for the
scandal in St. Kilda for which Mr. Brewer was blamed."</p>

<p>Tydvil's head never moved, but the pencil dropped from his
right hand and rolled off the table to the floor. For a second
the fingers of the left hand closed on the letter he was holding
with a pressure that almost tore one corner of it away. Had
Geraldine's gaze not been so intense she might have thought that
he was too intent on his letter to hear her. But Geraldine saw
and Geraldine knew, and her heart sang carols.</p>

<p>There was a long pause before Mr. Jones bent to retrieve his
lost pencil. When he sat up again, his face was slightly flushed,
as though from the exertion of stooping. He said, looking
innocently across at her, "I beg your pardon, Miss Brand, but I'm
afraid I was not listening to what you said."</p>

<p>Miss Brand repeated her words slowly and distinctly, and
added, "And, of course, you and I know that Mr. Brewer could not
have been involved in that disgraceful affair."</p>

<p>Tydvil's eyes were disarmingly frank. He smiled with kindly
indulgence. "Of course we know it. I'm afraid you worry too much
about that rather unfortunate affair." He laughed lightly, and
went on, "It is natural that our Mr. Billy looms so large just
now with you&mdash;but a little out of proportion."</p>

<p>The paternal and almost condescending tone of his voice so
exasperated Geraldine, that her hands itched to fling everything
movable on the table at the complacent head.</p>

<p>"I may be right," she persisted. "In any case, I think it
would be foul of one man to let another suffer for his misdeeds.
That Williams man is just the sort to do it, I think."</p>

<p>"It would be very shocking," commented Mr. Jones unctuously.
Then he terminated the discussion by writing a few words on the
letter on his blotting pad and busying himself with the next.</p>

<p>That morning as Geraldine left his room, Tydvil watched the
disappearing figure with speculative eyes. He was wondering very
profoundly, and somewhat profanely, by what process of feminine
devilry her mind had come to associate Williams with the St.
Kilda affair. There was, too, in his thoughts, an unselfish envy,
of Billy for the firm and pugnacious loyalty of Geraldine's
love.</p>

<p>At her own desk, the subject of his speculations was thinking
things about her employer that would have startled Tydvil. She
was so deep in thought that she did not notice that someone was
standing beside her until a soft but appealing little cough drew
her attention. Geraldine looked up to see regarding her, with
luminous eyes alight with amusement, the most handsome and
distinguished looking man she had ever seen.</p>

<p>Her swift return from abstraction and the unexpected presence
of the stranger drew from Geraldine a startled little "Oh!"</p>

<p>The smile spread from his eyes to his lips. "I am sorry. I'm
afraid I surprised you." There was courteous concern in the
voice.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I..." Geraldine floundered and blushed. She would
have been far more embarrassed had she known that the smiling
stranger had read her thoughts on Tydvil as distinctly as though
they had been spoken.</p>

<p>"Could I see Mr. Jones, please?" The quiet voice put her at
her ease again.</p>

<p>"Have you an appointment?" asked Geraldine.</p>

<p>"No," he shook his head. "But I think Mr. Jones will see me.
My name is Nicholas Senior."</p>

<p>That name, which had become known far and wide, brought
another embarrassed "Oh!" from Geraldine. She fumbled for her
extension phone and gasped "Mr. Nicholas Senior," then, still
flustered, "Yes, of course, Mr. Senior, Mr. Jones will see you at
once."</p>

<p>Mr. Senior bowed his thanks to Geraldine as kings bow to their
feminine peers, and passed into Tydvil's room. As the door closed
behind him she drew a deep breath, and murmured in an awe-
stricken voice, "Jerusalem! What a man! What a MAN!"</p>

<p>In Tydvil's sanctum, their greetings exchanged, Nicholas sat
opposite his friend, whom he regarded with such evident amusement
that Tydvil asked to share the jest.</p>

<p>"I doubt," replied Nicholas, "if you will find it as
entertaining as I do." He nodded his head in the direction of the
outer office, and went on, "I was smiling about that redheaded
Cerberus of yours. You will remember, Tydvil, that I warned you
she was dangerous."</p>

<p>Tydvil nodded thoughtfully. "She has me a bit worried,
Nicholas."</p>

<p>"She will have you much more worried unless you are careful,"
Mr. Senior replied thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Tydvil recounted his morning's conversation with Geraldine and
her unsettling suggestion of Basil Williams's connection with the
Brewer scandal. "Now how on earth," he asked in an aggrieved
voice, "could she have come at that idea?"</p>

<p>"My dear Tydvil," Senior grinned, "you impinge on matters
beyond our ken. I have never been able to fathom the workings of
a woman's mind. Indeed, I doubt if Providence has been any more
successful than I." He paused, and went on, "Would you like to
know just what she was turning over under that red thatch as I
came in?"</p>

<p>"I'd best know as much as possible," Tydvil muttered.</p>

<p>"Well," reported Nicholas, "I was beside her for several
minutes before I made her aware of my presence. During that time
she was busy persuading herself that it was not crazy to imagine
Basil Williams and Tydvil Jones being one and the same person,
but she was also recognising the sheer impossibility of
enunciating such a thing, let alone of proving it."</p>

<p>"Hell's bells!" ejaculated the astonished Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Aye!" Nicholas laughed, "and they'll ring a peal for Tydvil
Jones if that damsel can manage it."</p>

<p>"She's a witch," growled Tydvil.</p>

<p>"No! No, my friend!" Nicholas was still chuckling. "Just a
woman&mdash;a clever woman. You see how her mind has sliced clean
through all improbabilities and cut straight into the truth,
where a man's would have worked round and never come near
it."</p>

<p>"And to think," Tydvil stared blankly at the wall over
Nicholas's head, "that young baggage sat where you are sitting.
She looked at me with those innocent grey, eyes. She took all my
dictation&mdash;and all the time she was thinking
that&mdash;that!" His fist came down hard on the edge of his
table. "'Pon my word! Nicholas, it's enough to destroy one's
faith in women."</p>

<p>"When you've had as much to do with them as I have," Nicholas
smiled, "you will be far less credulous and far more
cautious."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" Tydvil's voice was anxious. "She'll tell
Brewer."</p>

<p>"You don't know that girl, Tydvil," Nicholas reassured him.
"Neither her conscience nor her essential loyalty will permit her
to discuss your affairs with him."</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" Tydvil appealed.</p>

<p>"Sit tight," Nicholas advised. "Let her guess what she likes.
She is too clever to put her suspicions into
words&mdash;unless...!" He paused.</p>

<p>"Unless what?"</p>

<p>"At an unlikely juncture where she needs to defend
Brewer&mdash;and I can guard against that," Nicholas said.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I think the world would be better without them,"
Tydvil reflected.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," conceded Nicholas, "but very, very dull."</p>

<p>"Oh! That reminds me&mdash;it was what I wanted to see you
about. I would like you to keep a close watch on Brewer this
afternoon," Tydvil said.</p>

<p>Nicholas raised an interrogative brow.</p>

<p>"One William Brewer," Tydvil grinned, "has an appointment in
the Botanic Gardens at three o'clock this afternoon, and he does
not wish to risk any intrusion of the other."</p>

<p>Nicholas nodded. "And how goes the romance? If the question is
permitted."</p>

<p>"We call each other Amy and William."</p>

<p>"Not so bad," Nicholas nodded with interest.</p>

<p>"And I have raised her hand to my lips without rebuke," Tydvil
added.</p>

<p>"Better still."</p>

<p>"Well," Tydvil spoke judicially, "I bow to your riper
experience, but I should have put it 'Not so good' and, 'Worse
still'."</p>

<p>"One thousand pounds for the Moral Uplift Society," prompted
Mr. Senior.</p>

<p>"Yes,"&mdash;Tydvil's voice grew hard&mdash;"One thousand
pounds!"</p>

<p>"And that address of thanks the society gave you." Nicholas
turned the knife in the wound.</p>

<p>Tydvil's jaw set harder. "See here, Nicholas! I don't want to
be greedy. Would you like to act as locum tenens for me this
afternoon?"</p>

<p>Nicholas's eyes danced. "Get thee behind me, Tydvil!" he
replied with mock severity. "No, the plan is all your own and all
that goes with it."</p>

<p>"It's a queer experience," Tydvil said thoughtfully, "to find
Amy pleasant and quite charming in her manner. I have heard that
she has a frustrated life because of a husband who does not
understand her. She tells me she needs sympathy and cherishing to
express herself fully. It appears that Mr. Jones is out of
harmony with her higher life."</p>

<p>"Umph!" commented Nicholas. "My own limited but sufficient
experience suggests that she does not need extraneous aids to
help her to express herself fully."</p>

<p>"Same thing occurred to me," agreed Tydvil. "If I've only
heard her on second gear, I hope I'm not about when she is going
flat out."</p>

<p>"It all seems very familiar to me," Nicholas said
reminiscently. "Let me see! That bit about the need of sympathy
and cherishing was not new when Venus fed it to Mars&mdash;poor
chap! I was at Olympus for a week-end when that scandal broke.
Thought it pretty poor sportsmanship of Vulcan making the affair
public. We went along to a cocktail party with Bacchus
afterwards. Juno was there and blamed Mars for everything."</p>

<p>"Seems to me they are not very original then," Tydvil
said.</p>

<p>"No need&mdash;not the slightest. They know jolly well that a
man will believe anything they tell him. Men ask for it&mdash;and
they get it." Nicholas spoke a little resentfully.</p>

<p>There was a pause that was broken by Tydvil. "Tell me,
Nicholas, are you worried about anything?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that can be helped, I'm afraid," Nicholas
admitted.</p>

<p>"Anything I can do?" Tydvil asked solicitously. Nicholas shook
his head. "Nothing&mdash;the truth is that things are in a far
worse mess here than I anticipated."</p>

<p>"Cheer up!" Tydvil smiled. "They've been bad before, and
mended."</p>

<p>"Never like this," Nicholas answered ruefully. "And the worst
of it is it is my own fault for lack of foresight. Serves me
right for listening to Judas Iscariot."</p>

<p>"May I hear..." Tydvil hesitated.</p>

<p>"Of course." Nicholas smiled. "No reason why you should not.
It began less than a century ago only. Our immigration department
noticed a decline in figures. They reported it was due to
distinct mitigation of the old religious animosities, and the
growth of sentiment against war&mdash;both serious factors from
our point of view."</p>

<p>"They would be," commented Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Well, I appointed a Royal Commission to enquire. But you know
what Royal Commissions are. They sent in a report of one hundred
and thirty-five thousand volumes. The only value it had was a
punishment to Royal Commissioners from earth. I made them read
it. But Judas Iscariot, who was chairman, sent in a minority
report on one sheet of foolscap. I read it, and that is where I
made the blunder."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think one sheet of foolscap could offer more than
one hundred and thirty-five thousand volumes report," commented
Tydvil.</p>

<p>"You don't know Judas Iscariot," answered Nicholas grimly.
"Mind you, it was a magnificent piece of constructive
hellishness. I admit that. It was such a thoroughly damnable
idea, that I accepted it without weighing the consequence to
ourselves. It backfired."</p>

<p>"It must have been a nasty piece of work," Tydvil said
sympathetically.</p>

<p>"It was," Nicholas continued. "He planned nothing less than a
second great betrayal. In his preamble he emphasised the
necessity for a doctrine that would not only turn race against
race and nation against nation, but one which would also create
internecine strife and inflame fratricidal hatred."</p>

<p>"A pretty doctrine," commented Tydvil dryly.</p>

<p>"There was more in it than that. The creed had to be,
apparently, simple to gull fools and superficially beneficial to
blind wiser men. Aimed at the destruction of religion, it had to
win the support of churchmen&mdash;or some of them. But it had to
be strong enough to wreck civilisation in a tempest of
bloodshed."</p>

<p>"Pleasant mind your friend Judas must have." Tydvil was
profoundly interested.</p>

<p>"Yes," Nicholas admitted, "and he built better than he knew.
In half a dozen lines below the preamble, he set out the doctrine
of Communism. And I&mdash;may I be pardoned for it&mdash;let him
do it."</p>

<p>"So that is how it began." Tydvil was awestricken.</p>

<p>"That is how it began," Nicholas echoed. "Judas claimed that
it needed his personal attention for propagation, so I let him
loose on earth. He took the name&mdash;let me see&mdash;the
name..." He drew his master card from his pocket. "Yes, that's
it&mdash;the name he took was Karl Marx."</p>

<p>"What! Karl Marx was..." gasped Tydvil.</p>

<p>Nicholas nodded. "Judas Iscariot none other. As we expected,
the creed spread like a disease. Look at the state of the world
today because of it. And this is only the beginning."</p>

<p>"But," Tydvil was puzzled, "isn't that what Judas and you
planned."</p>

<p>"True," Nicholas sighed, "but we did not foresee the effects
on our own Empire. For years now eighty per cent of our new
population has been Communists, and they are keeping my dominions
in a state of turmoil. We are never exactly peaceful, but our
gentlemen have always observed certain decencies. These fellows
don't recognise any, and are demanding a republic not that they
have any chance of getting it."</p>

<p>Tydvil laughed.</p>

<p>"Nothing to laugh at," said Nicholas a little sourly.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," Tydvil said contritely, "I was merely thinking
there was something of poetic justice in the reaction."</p>

<p>"Nothing poetic in it, believe me," growled Nicholas. "You
see, we have a very largely Conservative population&mdash;the fox
hunting and old port type; to say nothing of a very populous
colony of Royalties. You cannot expect gentlemen to tolerate
these fellows. They don't either," he added.</p>

<p>"Ructions?" asked Tydvil, still amused.</p>

<p>"There are, and believe me, civil war in Hell is no joke."
Nicholas spoke as one with a genuine grievance.</p>

<p>"Hard luck." Tydvil felt that his friend deserved
sympathy;</p>

<p>"The trouble is, too, that my people are inclined to blame me,
and I have to recognise they have cause for their loss of
confidence." Nicholas spoke glumly. "Would you believe it! Just
before I left home some new arrival organised a sit-down
strike."</p>

<p>"Characteristic," Tydvil observed.</p>

<p>Nicholas nodded. "But I soon settled that. I sent a five
million volt charge through every fire-bar in Hell, and there
will never be another sit-down strike at any rate&mdash;for
obvious reasons."</p>

<p>"There does not seem to be any remedy for your trouble,"
Tydvil said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"There is," replied Nicholas decisively, "and I am going to
enforce it the moment I return home. You see, Tydvil, a Communist
is not worth damning even, and I am not going to have them
cluttering up Hell and creating a nuisance. Not only that, but
they are going to suffer the punishment they deserve&mdash;and so
is Judas Iscariot. He has it coming to him."</p>

<p>"Is this going to be poetic justice?" Tydvil asked,
laughing.</p>

<p>"It is," Nicholas responded. "I am creating a new Dominion to
which every Communist will be transported. In it the Communists
will live with all their Communist doctrines rigidly
enforced&mdash; and if that will not be a merry Hell, my name is
not Nicholas Senior."</p>

<p>"And Judas Iscariot?" asked Tydvil curiously.</p>

<p>"He will be my Viceroy and will administer the doctrines he
created. Don't think I am vindictive, my friend. It is my duty to
administer impartial justice in my realms, and the fact that
Judas is an old and valued friend is no reason for mitigation of
his punishment. Eternity with Communism is the worst I can think
of."</p>

<p>It was Tydvil who broke the silence in which Nicholas sat
brooding. "Look, Nicholas," he enquired hesitantly, "would there
be any objection to my repeating what you have told me?"</p>

<p>Nicholas came out of his reverie. "No&mdash;none," he said
after a moment's thought. "But it will be too late to do any
good. That infernal doctrine of Iscariot's has too strong a hold.
But tell the story if you like."</p>

<p>"Tell me," asked Tydvil, "are Parlour Pinks included with the
Communists?"</p>

<p>An expression of disgust came into Nicholas's eyes. He waved
his hand curtly. "I'm not interested," he said shortly. "A
Parlour Pink is a lower creature than a Communist."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p>Tydvil had gained his heart's desire with Edwin Muskat's nose,
but he had to recognise that his adventure had not improved the
standing of Basil Williams in the community. In reporting the
story the morning papers unanimously demanded the suppression of
the now notorious roysterer. Their criticism of the police for
another failure to lay their hands on him stirred Russell Street
to its depths. Several scalp hunting members of the Opposition
ragged the Chief Secretary in the Legislative Assembly on the way
in which his department was mismanaged. Next morning he had a
heart to heart talk with the Commissioner of Police. The
Commissioner left the Ministerial presence with thoughts as red
as his close shaven cheeks.</p>

<p>That heart to heart talk, as it filtered down to the lower
ranks of the Metropolitan Police Force, lost nothing of its
scathing satire. Each subordinate as he received it from his
immediate chief added to and embroidered it as an outlet for his
own bruised amour propre. By the time it reached the rank and
file, both uniformed and plain-clothed, it had assumed the
proportions of a hurricane of vituperative malediction.</p>

<p>Boiled down, however, it amounted to only three words: "Get
Basil Williams!"</p>

<p>All this was reported faithfully to Tydvil by an amused
Nicholas, who pointed out that he thought that there was not
sufficient room in the Commonwealth of Australia for both the
Commissioner and Basil Williams. "You know, Tydvil," he added,
"giving good advice is not my forte, though I indulge in it more
often than churchmen would allow. Still, I do think you would be
wise to adopt some less conspicuous individuality. I'll admit, of
course, that Basil Williams becomes an increasing source of high
enterprise, but you will always be liable to have your amusements
curtailed by a brawl. Besides, there is always the risk of a
bullet."</p>

<p>A stubborn expression came into Tydvil's eyes. "Dash it all,
Nicholas," he exclaimed, "why should I be driven off the streets?
I like Basil Williams. He has some jolly good friends, too. I'd
lose them all as anyone else."</p>

<p>A slow smile spread from Nicholas's clean-cut lips. "Cherchez
la femme," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind, you wicked old ruffian," Tydvil laughed.
"Except for his relation with the police, Basil Williams is
eminently respectable."</p>

<p>"You may not be aware of it, Tydvil, but that festive young
woman named Elsie, who introduced you to the night life of the
city, would be very sorry, to hear that assertion."</p>

<p>Tydvil looked up sharply. "Nonsense!" he said. "She's quite a
nice girl."</p>

<p>"Much more so than some of her more conventional sisters,"
Nicholas agreed. "But at the present moment the police are using
her as bait for you, my boy."</p>

<p>Tydvil expressed an opinion about the police in terms that he
would not have dreamed of using a few weeks earlier. They were
ripe, fruity and concise. He was sitting at his table and,
cupping his face in his hands, he stared at the wall opposite,
his brow wrinkled in concentrated thought.</p>

<p>Nicholas from his armchair sat watching him. Presently the
smile he wore broke into a hearty laugh. "Magnificent, Tydvil!
Magnificent! You're a credit to me."</p>

<p>The words brought Tydvil erect. "You...?" He broke off,
staring at Nicholas.</p>

<p>"Understand? Yes!" Nicholas was still laughing. "I was
wondering if you could find a way out."</p>

<p>"Did I really think of that myself, Nicholas," he asked,
"without your prompting?"</p>

<p>"Word of honour, yes," Nicholas replied. "I'm proud of you,
Tydvil."</p>

<p>"But can it be done?" Mr. Jones asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"It can be, and will be," Nicholas assured him. "How many will
you want?"</p>

<p>"I think a dozen would be enough," said Tydvil after a
moment's thought.</p>

<p>"Twenty if you like," Nicholas promised.</p>

<p>"Keep them in reserve. If I need more than a dozen I'll call
for them."</p>

<p>"Are you going to be in it yourself?" enquired Nicholas.</p>

<p>Tydvil nodded. "The first I think. It should be perfectly
safe. You can send the others along at about three-minute
intervals."</p>

<p>"Good," Nicholas replied, "depend on me."</p>

<p>Tydvil glanced at the clock on his desk. "Nine fifteen," he
said. "I'll make straight for the Casino Club. Is Elsie there?"
he paused to ask.</p>

<p>"Expecting you."</p>

<p>"Right!" Tydvil responded briskly as he stood up. "Keep them
away from me till I get there. They can pick me up at the
Casino."</p>

<p>Two minutes later, Basil Williams, with his hat at its usual
insolent angle, was striding along Swanston Street. He had the
bearing of a man who was going places to do things.</p>

<hr width="25%" align="center"> <p>At nine forty-five all was
quiet at the Russell Street Police Station. A few minutes earlier
Inspector Kane had dropped in. Inspector Kane was a sore man. He
knew Basil Williams only by name, but there was no man in the
city whom he disliked more. Inspector Kane had thirty years of
blameless service behind him, and Basil Williams had clouded its
brightness. His sentiments towards Basil Williams at the moment
were positively ferocious, but as he discussed that dissolute
ruffian with the senior constable on duty his voice and bearing
were coldly official.</p>

<p>The watch-house at Russell Street can hardly be described as
cosy. Those of my readers who have been arrested will remember
that after staggering up the steps into a cheerless vestibule,
they turned down a corridor to the left, to arrive before the
counter of an office at its end. If it was not their first
appearance they, of course, received a more or less cordial
reception from behind the counter, where a face was never
forgotten.</p>

<p>The furnishing of the charge room is neither lavish nor
tasteful. Besides the counter there is one large plain deal
table, and one unsympathetic chair. On the wall opposite the door
is a clock. On the counter is a telephone, a type-writer, and the
charge book. The wall on the right as you face the counter is
hidden by shelves that hold a large library of photograph albums.
The department makes a hobby of preserving the portraits of all
its visitors. They are kindly folk. Fortunately, one is not
detained there long before being conducted to the more homely
comfort of the cells.</p>

<p>The visit of Inspector Kane was by no means usual. Of the two
seniors on duty, one was wondering what the heck he was snooping
round for, and the other was wishing to heck he would clear out.
He sat on the corner of the table whence he had an uninterrupted
view down the corridor of approach. His aspect was sombre and his
speech matched his aspect.</p>

<p>"You both should be proud, as I am," Kane was saying to an
inwardly fuming audience of two, "to belong to an organisation
which permits a common drunk and disorderly to walk out of his
cell, to paint the town red, and to make monkeys of the whole
force."</p>

<p>"I was not on duty when he escaped," protested one exasperated
subordinate.</p>

<p>The voice went on without heeding the interruption. "And the
newspapers! How they flatter us! How they enjoy Mr. Basil
Williams! I don't know whether we are more deeply indebted to
them or they to us."</p>

<p>There came the sound of scuffling feet and angry voices from
the unseen vestibule. As the sound was normal none of the three
took any notice of it.</p>

<p>"But perhaps we both should regard your Mr. Basil Williams as
our benefactor. Should you ever see him again..."</p>

<p>The moody monologue was broken by a startled exclamation from
one of the receiving officers.</p>

<p>"Holy smoke! It's him!"</p>

<p>As he spoke there was propelled into the room, before a large
plain-clothes man, a writhing, dishevelled and protesting figure.
At the sight of him the eyes of the senior constable lit with a
savage welcome.</p>

<p>"Basil Williams!" he almost shouted. Then, to the propeller,
"Where did you pick him up?"</p>

<p>"Down at the Casino Club with that red-headed tabby, Elsie
Wilson&mdash;knew he'd come back there," responded the guardian
of the captive triumphantly.</p>

<p>"I insist on knowing the meaning of this outrage?" demanded
the capture. "I protest..."</p>

<p>"Cut that fooling out, Williams," snapped the senior
constable. Then, over his shoulder to Kane, he added, "This is
Williams, sir."</p>

<p>"How dare you say my name's Williams," barked the indignant
captive. "My name is Mark Harding."</p>

<p>Inspector Kane rose from his seat on the table and, leaning on
the counter, inspected the prisoner with cold satisfaction. "So,
you're not Mr. Williams, you're Mr. Mark Harding."</p>

<p>"Yes!" asserted the prisoner furiously, "and who the
(censored) are you?&mdash;you bladder-headed bun-faced son of a
gun!"</p>

<p>Kane disregarded the personality and the question, and turned
to the senior. "Quite sure?"</p>

<p>"I could pick him out, and swear to him from ten thousand,"
asserted the senior.</p>

<p>"So could I, sir," insisted his colleague. "Why, he's wearing
the same clothes!"</p>

<p>"I tell you my name's Harding!" shouted the captive. "I
protest. I demand to see a lawyer. You thick heads! How dare you
arrest me, you blundering gang of double-ended baboons?"</p>

<p>"Such language, sir," put in the senior. "Last time he was
here he said I was the last of a long line of bachelors."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" commented Inspector Kane, with interest. "I wonder
how he found that out. Still," he turned to the prisoner, "I
think it only fair to advise you that the bench will not take a
lenient view of your reflections on either my ancestry, which, I
assure you, are baseless, or on that of the senior constable on
which I have no information."</p>

<p>"Oh, shut your head and tell me why I am arrested!"</p>

<p>Kane leaned over the charge book. "Well," he smiled, "Mr.
Williams, for a start there are charges here of drunk and
disorderly, assaulting six constables, damaging three uniforms,
bad language, insulting behaviour, absconding from custody,
destroying government property." He turned over a page or two.
"Here is another drunk and disorderly, insulting
behaviour..."</p>

<p>"You're talking absolute rot!" interrupted the captive. "I
tell you I only landed here from Adelaide this morning. I've
never been in Melbourne before in my life."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" responded Kane tartly. "No doubt the bench will be
interested to hear that tomo&mdash;."</p>

<p>The word was snapped off on his lips, and Inspector Kane stood
glaring at the doorway. There, framed, as a picture, stood a
large uniformed man holding in check, with some difficulty, an
exact replica of Mr. Mark Harding.</p>

<p>Taking the staring silence of the group at the counter for
delight too deep for words, the constable announced proudly,
"I've got him! Senior, I've got him! Picked him up in Swanston
Street."</p>

<p>As he spoke his captive broke from his grasp and hammering an
angry fist on the counter, demanded an explanation for "a
preposterous and unheard of outrage."</p>

<p>For a moment no one spoke. The three men behind the counter
stared from one prisoner to the other. As they did, the newcomer
made a rapid survey of Mr. Harding and blurted out an astonished,
"Who the blazes are you, sir?"</p>

<p>Mr. Harding returned the stare with a slow
"Well&mdash;I'm&mdash; blowed!"</p>

<p>Kane found his voice. "There seems, Senior, to be some element
of doubt." Then, to the new-comer, with frozen politeness, "May I
venture to enquire if your name is Basil Williams?"</p>

<p>"No, sir! It is not!" thundered the man.</p>

<p>"I was afraid so," muttered Kane.</p>

<p>"I, sir, am Norman Gore, of Invercargill, New
Zealand&mdash;and," he shook a finger in Inspector Kane's face,
"perhaps you, sir, you will be good enough to tell me why the
blue blazes I've been dragged by that walking lump of
putty"&mdash;he pointed to the constable&mdash;"to your infernal
police station. Tell me that!" His open palm smashed down on the
charge book.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can enlighten the gentleman," said Kane, glaring
at the senior beside him.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I..." What the senior might have said was interrupted
by a loud, commanding voice from the corridor.</p>

<p>"Keep your filthy hands off me, sir! How dare you touch me! By
Gad, sir! I'll have you broke for this!" The uniformed man by the
door was thrust unceremoniously aside as a third edition of Basil
Williams strode into the room, followed by Senior Constable
O'Connor.</p>

<p>Number three raged up to the counter: "Who's in charge of this
lunatic asylum?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Of course, you're not Basil Williams, either?" Inspector Kane
felt that his sunny disposition was becoming overclouded.</p>

<p>"Basil&mdash;Damme, sir! What do you mean?" Then, as O'Connor
laid a detaining hand on his arm he swung round on him. "Take
your hand off me! How dare you touch me! Damme! Stand to
attention when you speak to me 'Shun!'"</p>

<p>The savage ring of command in the voice brought O'Connor to an
involuntary obedience.</p>

<p>"No," murmured Kane to himself, "I fear this is not Basil
Williams."</p>

<p>"Now, sir! Who commands here?" He shot the words at Kane's
head.</p>

<p>Kane looked from the volcano to his two predecessors and waved
his hand in introduction.</p>

<p>For the first time number three glanced at his companions in
captivity. "What the dooce is the meaning of this&mdash;this,
er&mdash; beastly masquerade&mdash;this is a plot! A plot! I
say!" Then, even more furiously, to Kane, "Do you know who I
am?"</p>

<p>"If you are not Basil Williams," Kane responded, "I will be
pleased to hear it."</p>

<p>"My name, sir, is Oliver." His fingers dived into his vest
pocket and drew forth a gold card-case. "Cyril Courtney
Oliver&mdash; Sir Cyril Oliver, late Colonel of His Majesty's
Eighteenth Dragoons." He thrust a card at Kane as though
presenting an automatic pistol.</p>

<p>"Don't believe him, sir," O'Connor intruded excitedly, "he's
nuts. I know he's Williams. I found him at the Casino Club
talking to that Wilson dame. She called him Basil."</p>

<p>"By Gad, sir!" shouted the infuriated Oliver. "You're mad!
You're not fit to wear a uniform, sir!"</p>

<p>"Ah! Can it!" growled O'Connor. "You can't fool me&mdash;why,
you flaming cannibal, there's the mark where you bit me the other
night..."</p>

<p>Before his prisoner could retort, he moved aside and O'Connor
caught his first clear view of the two other prisoners. As he did
so he stopped speaking, his jaw stuck on a dead centre. He glared
at Messrs. Harding and Gore and then transferred the glare to Sir
Cyril Oliver. There was an evident attempt on his part to put his
thoughts into words, but the only sound he emitted was something
akin to that made by the plug hole of a lavatory basin as it
empties itself.</p>

<p>Said Inspector Kane, very gently and patiently, "Are you
prepared to swear your man is Williams, O'Connor?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I..." began O'Connor desperately.</p>

<p>"Precisely! O'Connor," Kane's smile was neither happy nor
amiable.</p>

<p>"But, sir!" O'Connor found his voice. "There's something crook
about this. One of them's Williams."</p>

<p>"Well, since you know more of Mr. Williams than anyone,
perhaps you will pick him out. I may be pessimistic," Kane paused
to wipe his forehead with his handkerchief, "but it is a matter
on which I would not care to dogmatise."</p>

<p>At this juncture the three captives, pressing towards Kane,
raised their voices in vigorous and vituperative protest on the
indignity of their position. The three arresting constables
joined the group, from which rose an acrimonious clamour, which
was augmented by the earnest endeavours of the senior constable
to silence them.</p>

<p>None noticed for a moment that the riot was smothering a
smaller outbreak at the door. It was the plain-clothes man who
announced its advent by a shout of, "Cripes! Here's another ruddy
Basil Williams!"</p>

<p>And there was.</p>

<p>The new-corner was not taking the situation kindly, for his
advance to the counter, where the spectacle had stilled the
tumult, was caused by his captor urging him forward with one hand
grasping his collar and the other the seat of his pants. He
brought up against the counter with "a dull, sickening thud."</p>

<p>His face was crimson with fury as he yelped. "Bunch of wise
guys, eh! I want the United States Consul! I'll show you guys you
can't railroad an American citizen."</p>

<p>Inspector Kane raised a restraining hand and interposed
soothingly, "You are not by any means the Duke of Norfolk?"</p>

<p>"Quit kidding, flatfoot!" snorted the latest model of Basil
Williams.</p>

<p>"Nor Basil Williams?" Kane's voice was composed, but a little
frayed at the edges.</p>

<p>"Look yeah! Which of youse guys is the big noise here, or are
you all haywire?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Kane suggested, "an inspection of your three
friends will explain the situation."</p>

<p>The citizen of "God's Own Country" goggled at the other three
captives, and shouted: "Frame up! I want the American
Consul!"</p>

<p>No one heard Mr. Mark Harding murmur, "Three in a bunch,
Nicholas."</p>

<p>All were too intent on Sir Cyril Oliver, who evidently
resented being classed as the new-comer's friend, for he exploded
in a blazing string of profanity that more than maintained the
traditional reputation of dragoons for language.</p>

<p>"Hi!" shouted the senior constable. "You can't talk like that
here."</p>

<p>"By Gad, sir! Can't I?" snorted Oliver. "&mdash;- &mdash;-
&mdash;- &mdash;- &mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>The effort wrung an unwilling gasp of admiration even from the
senior constable, who imagined until that moment that he had
nothing more to learn in graphic malediction.</p>

<p>But duty is duty. "I'll book you for that&mdash;Colonel or no
Colonel," he declared grabbing his pen. Then, over his shoulder
to his subordinate, "Answer that phone."</p>

<p>Inspector Kane was feeling at the moment that his cup was too
full to hold another drop of anguish. But the announcement that
the Commissioner was enquiring if Basil Williams had been caught
made him feel that he had been inflicted with an unfair share of
tribulation. As he took the receiver, the argument between
officials and captives broke out with renewed strength.</p>

<p>Three times did he try to make the irascible voice from wires
understand that four men, identical with Williams, had been
brought in. Then, while he was spelling the word f-o-u-r to an
uncomprehending chief, he suddenly looked towards the door and
gasped, "No. I mean seven." The voice enquired with freezing
sarcasm if he were quite sure he had not overlooked a few more
Basil Williamses. It went on to assure Inspector Kane that only
one Basil Williams was required&mdash;the right one. He
appreciated the zeal that had collected seven, but&mdash;it went
on&mdash;doubted if either the bench or the press would be so
favourably impressed by the industry of the police. The voice
would accept it as a kindness if Inspector Kane would report in
due course if Basil Williams should be arrested, an achievement
which seemed at the moment highly improbable.</p>

<p>Gently, replacing the receiver, Kane looked at it with a
malevolence it did not deserve. Softly he repeated what he could
remember of Sir Cyril Oliver's final outburst, then, feeling a
little relieved, he turned on the riot that raged across the
counter. "Silence!" His voice crashed in on the uproar to which
three newcomers were adding their quota.</p>

<p>"Take those men into the inner corridor and shut the door," he
ordered. "You wait, O'Connor!" he added.</p>

<p>Seven protesting captives and six constables filed out of the
charge room into the gloomy, bare corridor that led to the
cells.</p>

<p>Kane watched them until the door closed. Then, hands deep in
his trouser pockets, he paced to and fro with his head bent in
thought. Neither the senior constable in charge nor his colleague
cared to break into that reverie. The silence was broken by
another shuffle of steps from the outer world. Kane paced on
unheeding. Then a bright voice broke into his thoughts. "The
beer's mine, Senior! I've got him! I've got him!" From the
pitying eyes of the two men behind the counter that juicy young
constable met the basilisk glare from the pale countenance of
Inspector Kane.</p>

<p>"Beer&mdash;beer&mdash;" the voice grated at him, "you'll
get&mdash;beer!" There was a pause between each word as though it
were wrenched out. Then, "Take that man into the
corridor,"&mdash;the trembling finger pointed&mdash;"and stay
there with him."</p>

<p>He stood while the staggered constable removed his obnoxious
presence and more obnoxious charge. Then he turned to
O'Connor.</p>

<p>"O'Connor,"&mdash;the Inspector had himself under
control&mdash;"you saw Williams on the night of the first riot.
You arrested him the time he escaped from custody. You saw him
the other night when he escaped arrest. Is that not so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" replied O'Connor.</p>

<p>"Do you honestly think you could pick him out of that gang of
humming birds?" Through the closed door the murmur of voices
indicated that the captives were still protesting.</p>

<p>"I thought, sir," answered the stolid and bewildered O'Connor,
"that I could swear to him anywhere, but now..." He paused.</p>

<p>"I understand." Kane nodded with pursed lips. "What about
you?" He turned to the senior and his subordinates.</p>

<p>"No hope, sir," said one. "Same here," replied the other.</p>

<p>"If you ask me, sir," O'Connor ventured, "that Williams
bloke's put something across us."</p>

<p>For once the sharp edge of adversity had taken the sting from
Kane's temper. He looked at O'Connor thoughtfully. "I'm crazy
enough to agree with you, O'Connor, but..." He paused, and almost
wailed. "Dammit all, how could he? Eight of them..."</p>

<p>"Nine!" said the senior, who was looking down the corridor.
"There's another coming."</p>

<p>The four watched the entrance of a new candidate in silence;
as a plain-clothes man led him to the counter. Entirely
disregarding the pride of his captor and the wrath of the
captive, the four officials examined the man with eyes trained to
miss nothing.</p>

<p>"The dead spit of him, sir!" O'Connor spoke, "and the dead
spit of every one of the others."</p>

<p>Kane ordered the astonished couple to join the menagerie in
the corridor.</p>

<p>"Do you men recognise what this means?" asked Kane as they
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Williams had diddled us," said the senior.</p>

<p>"That's one way of putting it," Kane agreed. "But how? It's
preposterous!"</p>

<p>"Can't make me believe it's coincidence," the senior growled.
"Nice fools we look."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;look here, sir," O'Connor broke in. "You can bet
your life that swine Williams knows it, and he's one of
them."</p>

<p>"Hopeless!" muttered Kane. "There isn't a magistrate in the
world who would convict."</p>

<p>"It's a put-up job, all right," the senior muttered. "Prove
it!" snorted Kane. "I suppose you did not finger-print
Williams."</p>

<p>"Never do it until the morning, sir," the senior replied.</p>

<p>"Then we're scuppered!" Kane's voice almost broke. "And see
what a hole we are in. We can never dare to try to arrest him
again that is, unless he commits another offence and we get him
red-handed."</p>

<p>The others nodded a bitter acknowledgment of the truth.
"What's to be done, sir?" asked the senior.</p>

<p>"Nothing, it's a washout! Lord send the press don't get hold
of the story. Kane walked from behind the counter and followed by
O'Connor, passed into the inner corridor to be greeted by a storm
of abuse and demands for immediate release.</p>

<p>"Line those men up!" Kane ordered.</p>

<p>Nine Basil Williamses shuffled into line and faced him
defiantly.</p>

<p>Kane and O'Connor walked slowly down the line in the hope of a
possible clue, but there was none.</p>

<p>He stood before them at last. "One of you," he said, "I am
convinced, is Basil Williams. It is with profound regret that we
cannot positively identify him. To the other eight, I offer
apologies for a mistaken identity, which any honest (he
emphasised the word) man will pardon. You may all go, as there
can be no further reason for detaining you. Though I am convinced
that some of you at least are associated with Basil Williams.
Go!" he hooted, as they paused as if to argue.</p>

<p>Kane watched them till they filed down the entrance corridor
into freedom. Then he addressed the waiting constables: "Don't
bring in another Basil Williams unless you actually catch him
committing an offence. Warn all other men you see." Then he, too,
departed.</p>

<p>That evening, before midnight, three more samples of Basil
Williams were brought into the watch-house. They were all
rejected as though plague-stricken by the charge officer&mdash;
especially the one, Sir Cyril Oliver, who was arrested for the
second time that night. The senior constable in charge suffered
the orderly room dressing down he received from the Colonel in a
seething silence.</p>

<p>One Basil Williams spent what was left of the night at the
Casino Club, enjoying the society of a lively and openly adoring
partner whom he addressed as Elsie.</p>

<p>As Basil Williams said much later that night, in his bedroom,
to Nicholas Senior, he had been given "the freedom of the city."
He went on to relate that during the evening O'Connor had
returned to the Casino and had glared balefully at Basil
Williams, but without attempting to hinder his movements. "I
think," Tydvil observed, "O'Connor would have given a month's pay
to bite me. He looked like it, anyway."</p>

<a name="ch28"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p>For a few weeks Tydvil's days and nights passed in uneventful
happiness. August had passed into late September. Although he by
no means neglected his empire in C. B. &amp; D., there were
afternoons during which he did not appear at the office. The
widening circle of friends made by Basil Williams were making
some demands on the daylight hours as well as those of darkness.
He was aware, but made no sign of his awareness, that Basil
Williams was under close observation by unobtrusive men. In
police quarters he was a subject of occasional heated argument,
because, on comparing notes, different officers claimed to have
watched him in diverse activities in diverse places. Inspector
Kane himself had read a detailed report on a merry picnic Basil
Williams had adorned one Saturday at Beaumauris. At the time the
picnic was in progress he had been introduced to Sir Cyril Oliver
by their mutual friend Archie Stone on the Moonee Ponds
racecourse. Sir Cyril had been in a genial mood and freely
forgave Kane for the inconvenience of his arrest.</p>

<p>Kane had also unprofitable consultations with Senior Constable
O'Connor on the subject of the place of abode of Basil Williams.
Every attempt that had been made to trace him, or anyone
resembling him, to his lair, had been a dismal failure. Williams
or his doubles seemed to have an uncanny power of vanishing into
thin air if he turned a corner or entered a building.
Unfortunately, also, no Basil had committed any act that could be
construed into a breach of the law.</p>

<p>"But, dash it all!" Kane spoke fretfully after the report of
still another failure, "he must live or sleep somewhere."</p>

<p>O'Connor looked glum. "Martin swears he never lost sight of
him for a moment from the time he got into a train at
Sandringham. He left the station by the Elizabeth Street
entrance, crossed Flinders Street and walked slowly until he
turned into Degraves Street. Martin was not one hundred feet
behind him, but when he reached Degraves Street the brute had
disappeared&mdash;not a sign of him."</p>

<p>"Must have dodged into a shop. It's not one hundred yards
long, anyway!"</p>

<p>"Too late for that. They were all closed," O'Connor assured
him.</p>

<p>"But was there no one in the street?" demanded Kane. "'Martin
swears that the only soul in it was that wowser chap, Tydvil
Jones, walking towards him."</p>

<p>"Rot!" grunted Kane. "Martin's a dashed idiot. Did he question
Jones?"</p>

<p>O'Connor nodded. "Jones said he hadn't seen anyone pass
him."</p>

<p>Kane stared at his subordinate. "Well, one of them was a
liar," was his uncompromising retort. Then, sharply, "Didn't you
tell me Williams was wearing Jones's hat on the night of the
first brawl?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Jones explained that. The hat was stolen from the dining
room at the Carlton," O'Connor replied.</p>

<p>"Dashed queer," Kane murmured thoughtfully, "that Jones was
the only man in the Centreway the night you let Williams bite you
and get away."</p>

<p>The senior constable reddened at the memory and the taunt.
"Jones wouldn't say 'Boo!' to a goose. His missus allows him a
bob a week pocket money, and washes his face and hands before she
puts him to bed every night. Besides, there's three inches
difference in height and build."</p>

<p>"What I mean is," Kane waved an impatient hand, "that Jones
might know more than we think he does." But he added, "Though
what that ginger-beer-swigging pip-squeak would be doing with
Williams is more than I know." He glanced at a paper before him.
"I see some Williams has thrown three hot parties this
week&mdash;and two on the same night at different places."</p>

<p>"That's just it, sir," O'Connor said glumly, "and neither of
them may have been Williams."</p>

<p>Kane waved him from the room with a gesture of mingled despair
and disgust. As O'Connor reached the door, however, he called him
back. "Put a couple of men on to watch Jones for a week or two,"
he ordered. Then, seeing the expression on the senior's face, he
added, "And tell them to be dashed careful they're not
noticed."</p>

<p>But Tydvil's shadows drew a blank. Mainly because when
Nicholas warned him of his followers, Tydvil was, to use his own
expression, dashed careful there was nothing to notice.</p>

<p>But while Basil Williams was living a sinfully gay and happy
life, Tydvil Jones had a matter in hand that was rather more
complicated than troublesome. Billy Brewer had asked for an
audience with his chief, and had somewhat nervously informed him
that Cranston had cited him as co-respondent in a case that he,
Brewer, intended to defend.</p>

<p>Tydvil's well acted dismayed surprise on a subject on which he
was fully informed, added to apprehension. The Chief was
inexpressibly shocked at the tidings. He pointed out to Brewer
that he was facing the inevitable results of his reckless past.
"It is a personal matter, Brewer, on which perhaps, I have no
right to dwell! But I cannot help thinking that such a
distressing affair must be extremely distasteful to Miss
Brand."</p>

<p>Billy admitted that Geraldine felt the publicity would be
extremely distasteful, but that she was in agreement with him
that he should defend the case.</p>

<p>"You will perhaps recognise, Brewer," Tydvil said stiffly,
"that while I think you may be taking the right course, I find
myself in a somewhat difficult position. You will remember that
in the police court proceedings I defended you effectually, but
very unwisely, by giving evidence that was not
based&mdash;er&mdash;on fact."</p>

<p>"I was very grateful, sir!" Billy conceded. "But I don't think
I will need your evidence. I have another witness in Geraldine,
who saw Cranston's wife that night."</p>

<p>"Well," said Tydvil at length. "Of course, you have a right
and a duty to clear yourself from Cranston's assertions. But
should the Court find against you, I am afraid I shall have to
reconsider our association. You will, I think, see for yourself,
that such a scandal associated with C. B. &amp; D. would be
almost impossible for me to overlook."</p>

<p>Billy bowed to the decision. He had expected that much, at
least, and thought himself lucky that Tyddie did not rule him out
on the sole ground of being named co-re.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tydvil sent for Cranston and diplomatically
suggested that he should withdraw his petition on the grounds of
reasonable doubt. But he found his man maliciously determined on
vengeance on his wife arid Billy Brewer. Tydvil, the head of C.
B. &amp; D., was obliged to recognise Cranston's right as a
husband. Tydvil, the sinner, knowing his own share in the affair,
felt an unrighteous longing to punch the sneering vindictive face
across his desk. He knew, or felt he knew, that Hilda Cranston
was as much sinned against as sinning, and that Cranston was
actuated by cold-blooded malevolence rather than by righteous
wrath.</p>

<p>Finally, having learned that Hilda Cranston had left her
husband and obtained employment, he told the more or less injured
man that he intended to dismiss Brewer should Cranston obtain his
decree. "On the contrary," he added, "should the Court decide
against you, you must look for another position. I have not been
aware, until now, of the cause of the friction in the warehouse
between yourself and Brewer. I cannot have the place disorganised
through your private quarrels."</p>

<p>But a day or two later Tydvil had more cause for concern than
he dreamed. Always generously concerned with the welfare of his
employees, Tydvil noticed one morning that Geraldine was
suffering from a slight cold. When they had finished with the
mail, he said, "And now, the moment you have finished typing
those letters, put on your hat and go home."</p>

<p>"But...!" Geraldine began to protest.</p>

<p>"No 'Buts'," laughed Tydvil. "Brewer might get that cold and
that would be a nuisance. You might get worse and be laid up, and
that would be a still worse nuisance. I might get it from you,
and that would be a catastrophe. Tell Miss Marsden to take your
work&mdash;and give her a dictionary. Her spelling is
fearsome."</p>

<p>Later that morning as Geraldine was tugging her hat on to the
correct angle, Tydvil looked up. "Keep in the sunshine, Miss
Brand," he advised, "and don't let me see you again until you've
ceased being a walking menace."</p>

<p>Geraldine bade farewell to Billy in a sheltered corner of the
warehouse, where Billy recklessly defied the risks of infection,
despite her laughing protests, and departed. Next day she felt
better. It was a day that would make anyone feel
better&mdash;pure unclouded sunshine with the first hint of
Spring.</p>

<p>She rang Billy at the office and commanded that he should
spend the evening with her. She also heard of his intentions for
a busy day and other small, but to both, matters of prime
personal importance, such as that she had not sneezed once, he
had no trace of a cold, she hated missing their morning greeting
in Tyddie's office, he was feeling miserable to see that Marsden
kid in her throne, and that the flowers he had sent her were
glorious and that she was wearing one at the moment of
speaking.</p>

<p>The morning passed slowly. After lunch Geraldine reflected
that it would be nearly eight hours before she could see Billy
again and that each hour had sixty slug-like minutes. How to kill
those slugs? Geraldine stood in her garden and surveyed the blue
sky. Then her feet danced her into her bedroom, where she chose a
soft green hat that-enhanced the gold of her own bright helmet,
because Billy liked that hat. Then she sought and found a
magazine and sallied forth. At her gate she paused and reflected
again. Then her face lit up and, humming softly to herself, she
made her way to the nearest tram line.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later a tram deposited one tall, lovely, grey-
eyed, demure and red-headed damsel, wearing a very becoming green
hat, at a corner near an entrance gate to the Botanic
Gardens.</p>

<p>Unhurriedly, Geraldine strolled slowly towards the Gardens.
One long golden afternoon was hers to waste. Luxuriously she
sniffed the soft air. Appreciatively her eyes gathered in the
signs of coming spring, followed the wonderful wide sweep of
lawns, and sparkled more brightly than the sun on the still lake
waters.</p>

<p>At the lake's edge, she held converse with a sooty black swan,
unaware that of the two she was the more graceful. For a while
she sat dreaming, her magazine unopened in her lap. Then a
thought of tea intruded itself into her mind. Still slowly she
idled her way along winding paths until she reached the kiosk
under its wide shelters of green.</p>

<p>There were not a dozen people at the scattered tables
overlooking the lake. Geraldine drank her tea and ate scones with
a healthy appetite, lingering after she had finished, gazing at
the haze of the city above the tree tops in the distance.
Somewhere under that haze was Billy, going on his lawful
occasions. He seemed nearer for the knowledge.</p>

<p>Her gaze lowered to the drive that led from the river gates.
Anyone watching her would have seen the dreaming look in her eyes
change swiftly to wide stare of bewilderment, that changed as
swiftly to excitement. Strolling along the wide path towards the
kiosk, and deeply immersed in themselves, came William Brewer and
Mrs. Tydvil Jones.</p>

<p>There was no indecision in Geraldine's movements. Swiftly she
stood up and, watching the advancing couple, she stepped behind
the shelter of a shrub. Then, screened by it, she walked slowly
backward, dodging carefully, keeping her prey under observation
as she reached a clump of bushes far enough away to cover her
retreat if necessary, but close enough to observe all she desired
to observe.</p>

<p>Unaware of the wide, grey eyes that watched their every
movement from beneath their long, curved lashes, Billy Brewer and
Amy appropriated a table for themselves and settled
down&mdash;Billy most obviously solicitous in his gentle
attentions to his surprising partner.</p>

<p>Every movement they made she followed with intense interest.
She was close enough, almost, to read the expressions on the two
faces. A score of emotions flashed into Geraldine's eyes, but
among them there was no trace of anger. Bewildered curiosity
predominated. It says much for Geraldine's perfect and
unquestioning loyalty to Billy, that not for one second did she
believe the evidence of her startled senses. There, before her
eyes, was Billy Brewer flirting outrageously with Mrs. Tydvil
Jones&mdash;flagrant devotion in his eyes. Yes, beyond doubt, it
was Billy, but&mdash;that sense that women possess that is beyond
the ken of man, assured her heart and soul it was not her Billy.
Just so, was she sure that his partner was Amy Jones.</p>

<p>Only Geraldine herself knew the happy response of her heart to
Billy's presence. But from the moment of her first glimpse of him
her heart scorned the impostor. Had it been her Billy, she knew
that the steady, unhurried pulse would have been raging with
anger and jealousy, and prompting her to shred the raiment of Amy
Jones far and wide across the green lawns.</p>

<p>Slowly, as the riot in her mind subsided, there emerged the
fact that her crazy guess at there being two Billy Brewers was
true. Back to her mind flashed the scene in the warehouse on the
morning when her Billy had been so gaily greeted by Amy&mdash;the
reason for which he had since so strenuously denied all
knowledge. So, thought Geraldine, Amy had been barking up the
wrong Billy that morning...</p>

<p>Womanlike, all her scorn turned on the peccant Amy, who was so
obviously lapping up the devotion of the man opposite her. "To
think," Geraldine reflected, "that poor Tyddie believes in that
hypocritical she-devil." Another problem came into her mind. "Did
Amy believe that her partner was Billy Brewer&mdash;or...?"
Geraldine could follow that line of thought no further. Despite
the mystery that had lately surrounded his life and morals, she
had a very deep liking for Tyddie, to whom she had been indebted
for much thoughtful kindness&mdash;her present afternoon's
holiday, for example. She liked him so much that the thought of
Amy's gross disloyalty to a man, who was far too good for her,
excited contempt for, and righteous wrath against, his
betrayer.</p>

<p>It would have given her intense satisfaction to walk across to
their table and tell Amy exactly what she thought of her
behaviour. But her commonsense forbade. Tyddie's secretary had no
right whatever to crash into his domestic affairs, however
scandalous they might be. Besides, she had a more urgent duty of
love towards her own Billy. As she watched she determined to find
out if possible the real identity of his scandalous double. Her
heart hardened as she considered his disgraceful manoeuvres with
Amy. "That," she thought, "was undoubtedly the man she had seen
with Hilda Cranston near His Majesty's Theatre that night. That,
too, was the man who had involved Billy in all his unmerited
tribulations." There grew up in her a fierce determination to
make the duplicate of Billy Brewer wish he had never been
born.</p>

<p>The hour and a half before the two showed signs of separating,
passed without notice by the excited girl. After they had had tea
they had wandered, and Geraldine blessed the luxuriant growth of
the gardens that provided such ample cover for her spying, for
which she felt no compunction.</p>

<p>It was nearly five o'clock before they separated near the
bridge over the lake. Geraldine watched the leavetaking, that
they supposed to be unobserved, with an exclamation of virtuous
anger. Then Amy turned towards the south entrance. Watching her
go, the false Billy crossed the bridge leisurely and made for the
north-west gate. Well under cover, Geraldine followed him,
determined to confront him before he left the gardens. While the
false Billy idled, she manoeuvred swiftly ahead across lawns,
till she found shelter on a seat behind a flower bed near the
path he must take. Here, unseen, she watched his coming. As he
advanced towards her, she saw him glancing round the deserted
paths and lawns. Evidently he was ascertaining if there was
anyone in sight. His patent uneasiness puzzled her.</p>

<p>Some twenty feet from where she sat concealed, a great elm
flung out its wide network of leafless branches from a two-feet
thick bole. Towards this the figure she was watching so intently,
advanced. He passed behind the bole, hidden for the fraction of a
second&mdash;but there appeared on the other side, not the false
Billy Brewer, but Tydvil Jones!</p>

<p>Geraldine had been on the point of rising to her feet to step
from her hiding place to confront the impostor. The shock of
astonishment she received was almost physical in its impact. It
was with a desperate effort she checked the cry that would have
betrayed her presence. Crouching low, through the leaves she saw
Tydvil pass within ten feet of her hiding place. The laggard pace
of the false Billy had changed to the swift, jaunty step she knew
so well. Petrified, she saw him pass. Petrified, she watched the
retreating back until it rounded a curve one hundred yards away,
and was hidden behind the foliage. Even then she did not move
more than her head as she turned to examine the scene of the
transformation to make sure her eyes had not disgraced
themselves. No! A mouse could not have hidden itself just at the
spot, much less the bulk of the false Billy.</p>

<p>Presently Geraldine stood up. She walked on to the path,
walked round the tree, examined it from every possible angle,
muttered to herself, "Geraldine Brand, you are going barmy," then
she returned to her seat. She felt her legs were insisting on a
sit-down strike. The situation was too much for them. When she
tried to think, she found her head not much more tractable than
her legs.</p>

<p>Had anyone been near enough to see Geraldine as she leaned
back in her seat, he or she might have been excused for thinking
that she had bats in her attic. For she sat there alternately
staring ahead, wide-eyed, and then, apparently, counting and
recounting her fingers. Then there were not two
Billies&mdash;there were&mdash;but one was Tydvil Jones&mdash;or
Tydvil Jones was Billy Brewer. But supposing Tydvil Jones was
Billy Brewer, why did he meet clandestinely, and flirt with, his
own wife? Geraldine had a fairly comprehensive knowledge of life,
if her actual experience was somewhat limited. She felt perfectly
sure, however, that married men did not meet their wives
furtively to flirt outrageously with them. Tydvil had a
reputation for being a mutt, but even he was not mutt enough to
flirt...Her thoughts checked with a crash that almost
disintegrated their gears. Or was he? No, not a mutt! Slowly she
turned that thought over in her mind. She listened to it. She
sniffed at it. She tasted that thought.</p>

<p>She, who had been for so long closer to Tyddie than any other
being, had guessed that Amy had made his life pretty tough going.
Not that hint or sign of it ever dropped from Tyddie.
Suppose&mdash; suppose&mdash;Tyddie had&mdash;deliberately
trapped Amy&mdash;Geraldine's set face relaxed, and a gurgling
laugh escaped her. Would it be possible? He, Tyddie&mdash;if that
other Billy had been Tyddie...He was, if she had not completely
lost her reason&mdash;perhaps she had...It was obvious that
Tyddie would not flirt with Amy for the pleasure of
it&mdash;therefore&mdash;that darned, wicked, unscrupulous little
ruffian had tied dear Amy in a knot from which a Houdini could
not escape.</p>

<p>Geraldine did not love Amy. She had suffered Amy's
insufferable patronage too often on that reformer's visits to the
office not to detest the very sight of that superficial, smiling,
exasperating face. Often in her heart she had felt profound
sympathy for the bedevilled Tydvil. Geraldine was neither
malicious nor vindictive, but as she turned over the preposterous
idea that had come into her mind, she felt that if her crazy
guess were correct, she could forgive the culprit
everything&mdash; even the wrong done to her Billy.</p>

<p>The fading light and the cooling air recalled her to
actualities. Hurriedly she rose to her feet and made for the
Domain. As she walked another idea came to tantalise her. If
Tyddie were the false Billy, then equally, so might he be the
notorious Basil Williams. The whole thing was crazy. No man could
transform himself she assured herself. But she had seen it done.
If these things happened, what mischief had Tyddie been up to? A
cold shiver passed through her. Her own clean, logical mind
rejected the thought of anything outside of natural laws.</p>

<p>In her heart she knew that her senses had not betrayed her
over the queer transformation she had witnessed. Her wholesome
nature had always rejected the possibility of things supernatural
in daily life. She scorned small superstitions. But she felt that
what had occurred could only be associated with something that
was repugnant to every fibre of her being. The thought that
Tydvil Jones was involved with anything of the kind came as a
positive shock.</p>

<p>Swiftly her mind reviewed the past few weeks. She could
definitely place the change in Tydvil from that morning of his
unexpected appearance on her encounter with Billy. Everything
dated from that day. His lies in the St. Kilda Court next
morning. Billy's amazing tribulation. The appearance of Basil
Williams, and Tyddie's further falsehoods about his
hat&mdash;"Oh, everything!" she concluded to herself.</p>

<p>That night on his arrival at her home, Billy found Geraldine
boiling with suppressed excitement. There was something
exquisitely tender and protective in her greeting of him that
made Billy almost dizzy with happiness. However, when she
released herself reluctantly from his arms, she led him to a
couch and seated him at one end of it. Turning, she gathered
three large cushions which she piled in the middle of it, and
seated herself at the other end.</p>

<p>Billy, watching her preparations with amused interest,
demanded with a laugh, "Why the fortification, darlint?"</p>

<p>"Billy," she responded, "there is going to be a long and
serious pow-wow, and neither of us can be serious closer than we
are now."</p>

<p>"Hang it, Gerry," said Billy, eyeing the barrier
distastefully, "if it is to be that serious, you should have
installed a telephone so as I could not see you."</p>

<p>She laughed happily. "Boy, I don't want the barrier there any
more than you do, but we must talk. It's terribly important."</p>

<p>The earnestness in her voice satisfied him. "Well, I'll
promise to be as serious as any man can be while he's looking at
you. But, please, mamma, get it over quickly. Those cushions are
suffocating me."</p>

<p>"First, Billy," she asked, "I want you to tell me everything
you did and everywhere you went between two o'clock and five this
afternoon?" Then, in answer to the questioning eyes, "It's not a
third degree, and I am not being catty."</p>

<p>Smiling and without hesitation, Billy gave an account of
himself. Twice only Geraldine interrupted, to fix the time of a
movement on an interview, as Billy recited the routine of his
afternoon's work.</p>

<p>Geraldine nodded her understanding, and, as he concluded,
again asked, "And every one of those men you saw and spoke to
could swear to it if necessary?"</p>

<p>"Of course," agreed Billy, "but what on earth's the matter?
Not more trouble, I hope?"</p>

<p>"There is more trouble&mdash;plenty of it. But not for you,
Billy, thank goodness."</p>

<p>She paused, and went on gravely, "Boy, tell me if you think I
am quite sane, because what I am going to tell you will sound
absolutely crazy&mdash;so crazy as to be normally impossible.
No!"&mdash; she put out an imperative hand&mdash;"you must stay
where you are."</p>

<p>"All right," he said resignedly, settling back in his corner.
"But I am not going to allow even you, Geraldine Brand, to make
insulting suggestions about yourself."</p>

<p>"Well, I only hope you'll feel that way when I have finished,
because, boy, you are about to receive some shocks."</p>

<p>"Shoot! I can stand them."</p>

<p>"Good! Here's the first shock." Her eyes danced. "At three
o'clock this afternoon Mr. William Brewer and Mrs. Tydvil Jones
took afternoon tea together at the kiosk in the Botanical
Gardens..."</p>

<p>"Holy wars!" Billy was on his feet.</p>

<p>She waved him back. "It was your double, Billy&mdash;the one
who has caused all the trouble."</p>

<p>Billy sank back, gazing at her blankly.</p>

<p>"I never doubted for a second, Billy, believe me. I felt in my
bones, as soon as I saw them, it could not be you&mdash;but the
likeness was amazing."</p>

<p>"Go on," he said weakly. "I&mdash;you said shocks,
Gerry&mdash;plural&mdash; don't say there are more."</p>

<p>"Afraid so, boy&mdash;much worse." Geraldine nodded. Slowly,
and carefully choosing her words, she unfolded the story of her
afternoon's adventure. Billy, exercising an amazing self-
restraint, listened silently till she told of the appearance of
Tyddie.</p>

<p>"But," he protested, "dearest, that's crazy&mdash;crazy!"</p>

<p>"Absolutely," she agreed, "but, boy, it happened exactly as I
told you."</p>

<p>There was a long silence. It was broken by Billy. "What you
mean is, that this bird who is the living image of me,-is also
Tyddie in another skin?"</p>

<p>Geraldine nodded emphatically. "Quite mad, I know, but that is
just what I mean."</p>

<p>"And," he went on, "this double-barrelled Casanova was also
toying round with the Seventh Commandment with Mrs. Tyddie?"</p>

<p>Geraldine pursed her mouth. "I'm no scandal-monger, boy, but
from the way she kissed him goodbye, I doubt that his attentions
and intentions are platonic."</p>

<p>"Suffering serpents!" growled Billy furiously.
"I'll&mdash;I'll sue Tyddie for criminal libel&mdash;I wouldn't
be found dead with her."</p>

<p>For the first time that evening Geraldine laughed heartily.
"You'd never make a jury believe any man made love to Amy."</p>

<p>"But don't you see, Gerry," Billy was very sober, "it is just
that that makes the whole thing more crazy still. Husbands don't
go round committing unnatural sorcery&mdash;for that's what it
is&mdash;to alienate the affections of their wives, especially
wives like Amy&mdash;it's not done!"</p>

<p>"It might be in some circumstances." Geraldine's voice was
full of meaning. "Put yourself in Tyddie's place."</p>

<p>"God forbid!" answered Billy piously. "But I can't imagine any
circumstances that would prompt me to make love to Amy."</p>

<p>"Suppose you were married to her..."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"And suppose you wanted to get square for years of
nagging."</p>

<p>Slow comprehension dawned in Billy's eyes. "Gerry," he
chuckled, "you've a disgusting Machiavellian mind. That's a
horrid thought, but&mdash;it fits&mdash;it fits!"</p>

<p>"Yes," Geraldine nodded, "it fits. But, Billy, where does it
lead us?"</p>

<p>"Well, we can't go round saying that Tyddie can switch himself
into any shape he likes. That's clear. We'd be run into a mental
home faster than a bat out of Hades."</p>

<p>"You see, Billy," she argued, "how, if we assume he can do it,
it explains everything. He must have been you that night without
the black eye when I saw him with Hilda Cranston."</p>

<p>He nodded. "You know, dearest, I'd been dodging her for months
and taking no notice of her letters."</p>

<p>"Billy,"&mdash;Geraldine smiled&mdash;"that murky past of
yours seems to have come home to roost on Tyddie."</p>

<p>"Peccavi, culpa mea. I'm penitent, and I deserve all I get,
but I'd hate to see you suffer for it."</p>

<p>"Forget it all, boy. I won't remember it." She held out her
hand.</p>

<p>There was an appropriate interlude.</p>

<p>Then Billy said, "I suppose what happened was, that she nailed
Tyddie in mistake for me."</p>

<p>"That would account for the whole wretched mix-up," Geraldine
pointed out.</p>

<p>"And," Billy spoke with deep indignation, "for the ghost of
Jerry McCann, and Tyddie's altruistic perjury next
morning&mdash;the double-edged little double-crosser!"</p>

<p>"And," Geraldine said with intense conviction, "for that Basil
Williams man also!"</p>

<p>"Oh, nuts! Gerry, darlint," protested Billy. "You're letting
it run away with you. Tyddie wouldn't get tight and paint the
town red. He never had a snifter in his life."</p>

<p>"You don't know half," she asserted. Rising, she went to a
drawer. "Look at those," she said, handing him an envelope.</p>

<p>Billy examined the cigar butts and bands it contained with a
connoisseur's eye. "Crikey! Gerry, those cost three and six
apiece," he said, looking up. "How come?"</p>

<p>Geraldine related the finding of cigars and the whisky
perfumed tumblers.</p>

<p>He heard her out. "Well," he said with profound feeling, "I
hand it to Tyddie for being the double-crossingest, and most
unmitigated double-shuffler, and the finest and most
uncompromising liar south of the equator."</p>

<p>"Fair enough as a character sketch," agreed Geraldine.</p>

<p>Then Billy laughed long and heartily. "I don't care, Gerry,"
he gasped, "but I like him all the better for it. Dash it all,
what a time he's been having!"</p>

<p>"I know it's disgraceful,"&mdash;Geraldine had joined in the
laugh--"but that's the way I feel about it, too."</p>

<p>"But how can he do it? How can he do it? There's no magic
these days."</p>

<p>"Do you know, Billy," Geraldine's voice was very grave, "I
can't help feeling Tyddie has mixed himself up with something
dreadful. What I saw this afternoon was not only not natural, it
was..." She paused.</p>

<p>"Pretty tough stuff," Billy nodded.</p>

<p>"There's only one word," Geraldine whispered, "Unholy!"</p>

<p>"It'll get him into one unholy mess, if he's not careful,"
Billy said.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be surprised if he has done that already," she
replied. "People don't meddle in things like that and get off
scot free."</p>

<p>"The question is," Billy returned to their own affair, "what
are we to do?"</p>

<p>"We can do absolutely nothing," Geraldine asserted. "Think,
Billy, what would people say if I told that I had seen your
double converted into Tyddie?"</p>

<p>"They'd probably say you'd gone potty, and believe it, too,"
Billy admitted. "Anyway, I can't see myself saying from the
witness box that the man who has been cutting capers with Hilda
Cranston was Tyddie in disguise as me."</p>

<p>"That's the madly exasperating part of it," Geraldine's voice
had an edge on it. "That demon Tyddie can laugh at us. He's
absolutely unassailable." She paused. "Unless..."</p>

<p>Billy sat up. "What's in that devious brain of yours, best
beloved? I'm with you if you want to put a swift one across
Tyddie."</p>

<p>Geraldine held out her hand to the light so that the diamond
on its finger flashed back in colour. "It's a positively catty
idea."</p>

<p>"I'll bite," Billy laughed. "Who's going to be the mouse?"</p>

<p>"Mice, darling." Geraldine chuckled, her eyes following the
flashing light from the stone. "Tyddie and Amy are elected as the
mice."</p>

<p>"And how?"</p>

<p>"Well, I think Amy believes that she has mortgaged her heart
to Mr. William Brewer&mdash;the Jezebel!"</p>

<p>"Jezebel's good&mdash;go on."</p>

<p>"Now, suppose I let her know quietly and quite casually that
I, Geraldine Brand, am engaged to marry Mr. William Brewer. Can
you conceive, first, how she would feel, herself? And secondly,
what she would say to that dastardly deceiver Brewer the next
time they met?"</p>

<p>"Just because I can conceive faintly what she would say to
William Brewer, I reject your plan with as much scorn as
haste."</p>

<p>"But, why, Billy? I think it is a lovely idea."</p>

<p>"Gerry, my angel, you're a perfect fiancee, but a positively
rotten conspirator."</p>

<p>"But, boy, wouldn't that smart and festive Tyddie get all that
is coming to him?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, and perhaps not," Billy insisted. "Suppose that
sweet thing you have just, very properly, defined as a Jezebel,
were, in the paroxysms of her joy at the news, to come hunting
for Mr. William Brewer at the warehouse. Beloved child, the
chances are she would chant her paean of praise to the first
Brewer she caught&mdash;who would be me."</p>

<p>"Ooh! I never thought of that."</p>

<p>"That's where my superior male brain comes in." Billy grinned.
"I love Tyddie as a fellow sinner, but jigger my eyes if I care
about acting as a lightning conductor for him for that
thunderbolt."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right," Geraldine admitted reluctantly. "What
a pity! You know, Billy, it would be a pure delight for me to
scratch pieces out of Amy, because the creature imagines she's
making love to you."</p>

<p>"It's a laudable ambition, sweetheart, but forget it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Geraldine decisively, "Tyddie's not getting off
altogether. Tomorrow morning I'm going to tell him what I saw and
demand an explanation."</p>

<p>"Gerry!" Billy's voice was really startled.</p>

<p>"He can only sack me, and I don't care if he does. But I don't
think he will do that much. He's too clever."</p>

<p>"But, dearest...!"</p>

<p>Geraldine swept the three cushions from the couch to the
floor, and the debate closed.</p>

<p>That night Tydvil Jones listened in silence to the news of
battle conveyed to him in accurate detail by Nicholas.</p>

<p>"Jove, Nicholas!" he said when the tale was completed, "you
were right about that girl."</p>

<p>Nicholas nodded. "She'll make things difficult for you, I'm
afraid."</p>

<p>"And to think that she put her finger at once on my affair
with Amy&mdash;do you know, I admire her. The pluck of her!"</p>

<p>"Aye, she's a fine type. Pity," went on Nicholas regretfully,
"that she is not on my side. On my side, Tydvil, it is women like
Geraldine Brand who wreck empires; on the other side they swindle
me out of men like William Brewer." Then he added, "What do you
propose to do?"</p>

<p>Tydvil stretched his legs straight before him and laughed
quietly. "Enjoy the fight, Nicholas."</p>

<p>"Have a care that she does not share too much in the
enjoyment," cautioned Nicholas.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p>Next morning Billy made a last moment appeal to Geraldine to
reconsider her decision to take the offensive. But he found
himself confronted with a calm and inflexible damsel, who assured
him that she was craving for battle and that nothing else would
satisfy her. She declined emphatically his offer to fight beside
her. The only concession she would make was that if she were
cornered she would call on him for reinforcements.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll think I'm greedy, Billy, but I can't share
this even with you," she said. "Tyddie has been fibbing to me for
weeks. He's let you in for a whole heap of trouble, and he is
going to answer to ME for it." There was a glorious light of
battle in her eyes.</p>

<p>Billy surrendered reluctantly.</p>

<p>Scarcely had Geraldine finished preparing the mail when
Tydvil's quick step in the warehouse announced his advent. He
entered his office with a hearty, "Good morning, Miss Brand.
Quite well again I hope!"</p>

<p>Geraldine replied demurely as usual. "Thank you, Mr.
Jones."</p>

<p>Then, as he hung up his coat, "It's really a pleasure to have
you back. Our little Miss Marsden is willing&mdash;but&mdash;she
is not Miss Brand. I'm afraid," he took his place at the table
opposite her, "that if I could arrange a quarrel between you and
our Mr. Brewer, I should be tempted to do it. The thought of
losing you haunts my days". His engaging smile as he spoke was
friendly and flattering.</p>

<p>Geraldine returned the smile. "That would be placing too high
a value on my services, Mr. Jones. Even if you could cause us to
quarrel, I know you are too kind-hearted to give pain to either
of us." She looked straight into his face as she spoke.</p>

<p>"You're quite right, Miss Brand. Quite right!" He opened the
first letter. "A charming romance such as yours is too fine to
spoil but I will miss you terribly."</p>

<p>The two worked on with their usual systematic efficiency that
scarcely needed words between them. Tydvil dictated letter after
letter in swift, flowing sentences that Geraldine caught and
stowed away faultlessly in her note book.</p>

<p>"That, I think, is the lot!" he said finally, sitting back and
running his eye over the table.</p>

<p>Geraldine was about to fire an opening well-rehearsed shot
when, as though aware of her purpose, Tydvil cut in with: "And
now, Miss Brand, I think we can discuss my private affairs on
which you are so much concerned." His smile was quite
friendly.</p>

<p>Although Geraldine was astonished she was by no means
disconcerted. Without hesitation she answered. "Thank you, sir,
the suggestion coming from you makes what I was going to say much
more easy."</p>

<p>"Well, now we can talk comfortably. Say just what you wish,"
he invited.</p>

<p>"I was going to do that in any case," retorted the smiling
Geraldine coolly.</p>

<p>"That was what I anticipated, Miss Brand," Tydvil came back
easily, "so I thought I would make the necessity of hearing what
you have to say something like an engaging virtue."</p>

<p>"You seem to be an adept at disguising anything as a virtue,
however remote it may, be from one," she flashed back.</p>

<p>He met the thrust with a quiet chuckle of evident enjoyment.
"First blood to you! Though, you know, it is hardly the kind of
thing a good secretary should say to her employer."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," came the uncompromising retort, "that is only
the beginning of what a good secretary is going to say to her
employer."</p>

<p>"Our little interview is not going to be dull then," he was
quite unabashed. "But, pray, don't let me interrupt you. Go
on."</p>

<p>"I will!" Geraldine replied with spirit. "Yesterday afternoon,
in the Botanic Gardens, I saw a man who looked like Mr. Brewer,
but who was really you, kissing Mrs. Jones."</p>

<p>"Well, really, dear lady," protested Tydvil, "though I admit
that in a public place it may not have been in the best taste,
after all, it is not a cardinal sin for a man to kiss his own
wife."</p>

<p>"If it were not a cardinal sin, it was something rotten to
kiss her when she thought it was another man&mdash;especially
from my point of view, when that other man was my fiance."</p>

<p>"But, Geraldine&mdash;may I say Geraldine, since our
discussion is so intimate?"</p>

<p>"You may not! Geraldine is for my friends."</p>

<p>"My apologies, Miss Brand. What I was saying was that it
appears to me that your views of the ethics of the case are
somewhat distorted. I knew I was kissing my wife. In justice you
should admit that any obloquy was hers."</p>

<p>"You or she may kiss anyone you please," retorted Geraldine
tartly. "What I object to is the wickedness of your involving Mr.
Brewer in your own private and personal scandals."</p>

<p>"A harmless proxy in this instance, I assure you."</p>

<p>"Harmless proxy indeed!" Her voice shook with indignation.
"Suppose Mrs. Jones learned of my engagement to him?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Miss Brand, please be fair. Why, you even suggested that
you should tell her yourself, only Brewer recognised, as I do,
that it would be injudicious."</p>

<p>His words left her, for the moment, breathless. They made it
clear that by some means he knew of everything that had passed
between herself and Billy. "From what you say," she said acidly,
"you appear to have added spying to your other activities."</p>

<p>"An unpleasant word very&mdash;and one that almost impels me
to suggest that your own activities yesterday were not very
remote from a similar practice." He was smiling derisively.</p>

<p>Geraldine felt that the fight was not going on the lines she
anticipated. But she kept cool. "Perhaps you will deny that I saw
you transformed from the likeness of Mr. Brewer to yourself."</p>

<p>"Miss Brand, I do not deny for a moment there was such a
transformation. But has it not occurred to you that it may cut
either way. Since the transformation did occur, how do you know
that it was not Brewer using my likeness to conceal his
indiscretions from you? And throw the blame on me."</p>

<p>"Of all the..." began Geraldine.</p>

<p>She was interrupted by a chuckle of amusement from Tydvil.
"Wait! I only suggested an alternative you overlooked. I could
not resist the temptation. No, I confess, freely, and without
reserve, verbal or mental, that it was I you saw in the Gardens
with my wife, and that it was I whom you saw passing while you
were hiding behind the flower bed on the hill near the north-west
gate."</p>

<p>Geraldine stared with blank amazement at the smiling face
across the table. "You admit that you used a dual
individuality?"</p>

<p>He nodded his affirmation. "Exactly that."</p>

<p>"Of all the cold-blooded, callous nerve! Of all the brazen
impudence I ever heard in my life! I think you beat everything."
Geraldine brought out each word to its utmost value.</p>

<p>"Well," said Tydvil as though weighing her vigorous comment in
his mind, "I feel that that is not an overstatement of the case."
His look conveyed the impression that she had complimented him
and he was proud of it.</p>

<p>"Of course," she said cuttingly, "you think I am flattering
you."</p>

<p>"One moment!" he interrupted. "I want to ask you one question.
Only one. Will you answer it truthfully?"</p>

<p>"I'll answer it truthfully or not at all," she replied
guardedly.</p>

<p>"Did not you and Billy Brewer agree last night that you liked
me more for my misdeeds than my virtue?" There was an entirely
engaging schoolboy grin on his face.</p>

<p>Taken aback at the extent of his knowledge, Geraldine admitted
the charge.</p>

<p>"Then," said Tyddie, laughing quietly, "what the heck are you
making all the fuss over?"</p>

<p>For a moment Geraldine tried to retain her gravity, but his
laugh was too infectious.</p>

<p>"But aren't you ashamed of yourself?" she demanded when she
recovered herself.</p>

<p>"Not a bit&mdash;not an atom. I've enjoyed every minute of my
life of sin." He rejoined, and if appearances went for anything,
he meant what he said.</p>

<p>"But," she asked, "do you recognise the trouble you have
caused Billy?"</p>

<p>Tydvil cupped his chin in his hand. "Geraldine,"&mdash;he
spoke very sincerely&mdash;"I will ask you to believe me when I
say that I really am sorry for that. It was done unintentionally
and without malice aforethought. It just happened."</p>

<p>She overlooked the "Geraldine."</p>

<p>"Your regret does not help him much," she said dryly.</p>

<p>"Still, I made all the amends I could." His eyes were laughing
at her across the table. "Does not a most flagrant perjury by
Tydvil Jones suggest that it comes from an humble and contrite
heart?"</p>

<p>"And to think," Geraldine's voice was deep with mingled
amazement and anger, "that that fool of a magistrate said you
were the only one who spoke the truth."</p>

<p>"But what a tribute to Tydvil Jones, Geraldine."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I believe you're proud of it!" She was feeling almost
helpless in the face of his brazen impenitence.</p>

<p>He nodded, chuckling. "My dear girl, I am. It was my first
effort at constructive lying. Every other witness spoke the
truth, but the reputation of Tydvil Jones triumphed. That is
where I reaped my dividends on a blameless life."</p>

<p>Geraldine could only sit and stare.</p>

<p>"Yes," he went on, "and even our usually astute William Brewer
accepted the supernatural appearance of Jerry McCann to repay a
loan, just on my reputation for veracity and probity. I suppose
he told you about that."</p>

<p>"He did," she snapped, "and I disillusioned him. I knew you
were not working back that night, and," she went on, her
indignation rising again, "you dared to threaten him with
dismissal if Cranston wins his case."</p>

<p>Tydvil laughed, unabashed. "That was all eyewash. I was
obliged to take high moral stand, but I had no intention of
carrying out the promise."</p>

<p>"You dare!" There was a warning in her tone.</p>

<p>"My dear," he said quietly, "it is my regard for your Billy
that protects him&mdash;to say nothing of my regard for you,
despite your uncompromising hostility," he added.</p>

<p>"And to think," her voice was cold, "I have been fool enough
to look up to you all these years, as the most honourable man I
ever met!"</p>

<p>"And a most awful mutt, too? Confess it, Geraldine," he
insisted.</p>

<p>She reddened under his steady, questioning gaze. There was too
much truth in his suggestion to leave her comfortable, or to
permit a frank answer.</p>

<p>"Come!" he persisted. "Did not you, and all the staff for the
matter of that, regard me as a pious ninny and an office
joke?"</p>

<p>"You know, well," she tried to evade the question, "that we
all like and respect you."</p>

<p>"Geraldine, I insist that you answer my question. I am being
honest with you now. I want honesty in return. Did you or did you
not look on me as a silly ass?"</p>

<p>There was a pause. "Well, we thought you were peculiar," she
admitted hesitantly.</p>

<p>He slapped the table. "Woman, answer my question and don't
shuffle!"</p>

<p>She saw his anger was assumed and laughed. "Oh, very well! If
you must have it, I thought that, apart from business matters,
you were positively nutty."</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said triumphantly, "at last, the truth. On a small
scale, you're a more practised fibber than I am."</p>

<p>"You flatter me, Mr. Jones," she bowed. "Still, I don't think
the fact is any explanation for your recent behaviour."</p>

<p>"That's just where you're jolly well mistaken. Can't you
follow the cause and the consequence?"</p>

<p>"I may be dull, but I certainly cannot," she answered.</p>

<p>"Well let me tell you, Geraldine Brand, that you and Master
Billy Brewer are responsible, individually and collectively, for
all the sins I have committed in the past two months&mdash;and
I'm grateful to you."</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the astonishment in her eyes "Billy and
I!" she gasped.</p>

<p>"Because I never realised how, to use your very descriptive
word, 'nutty' I was until I saw Billy kissing you that morning I
entered this room so malapropos."</p>

<p>Geraldine flushed divinely at the memory.</p>

<p>"You see," Tydvil went on reflectively, "I had never seen
anything like that before, and..."</p>

<p>"Oh, please!" she protested.</p>

<p>"Wait, let me finish," he went on, "and suddenly I was alive
to the truth that I had never kissed a girl, wouldn't be game to
kiss a girl, and had missed a lot of fun."</p>

<p>"But..."</p>

<p>He cut her short with a wave of his hand. "Moreover, I felt I
would gladly accept Billy's black eye in exchange for the fruits
of his enterprise."</p>

<p>"Mr. Jones!" Geraldine was struggling between embarrassment
and mirth.</p>

<p>"And," went on the shameless Tydvil, "after he had left the
room I recognised for the first time what a lovely girl you
are."</p>

<p>"Now stop!" Geraldine cut in abruptly. "Understand this, Mr.
Jones, only one man can say that to me, and you are not that
man."</p>

<p>"Don't waggle your finger at me, Geraldine, it's rude, and,
moreover, don't imagine for a moment, that in telling you this I
am harbouring invidious ideas regarding you&mdash;I'm not!"</p>

<p>"Lucky for you," sniffed the indignant maiden.</p>

<p>"What I am telling you is purely explanatory. Mind, though,"
he added laughing, "if I were not sure you were thoroughly
besotted over Billy, I don't know that my regard would be so
platonic."</p>

<p>"Besotted!" she almost hissed. "Besotted, what a word! You,
you..." She paused for loss of a word. "Go on," he prompted.</p>

<p>"You demon!"</p>

<p>"Very poor, very!" He was still laughing. "Really, Geraldine,
I think you could have done better than that."</p>

<p>She sank back in her chair, for the moment defeated by his
total insensibility to her anger.</p>

<p>"As I was saying," he went on, "the episode awakened me to the
fact that I had not had much fun in my life, so I started out to
make up for lost time."</p>

<p>Geraldine regarded him speculatively, for a long moment and
then murmured, "So that was it!"</p>

<p>"So that was it!" he repeated.</p>

<p>"But," she said presently, "that may account for the things
you have been doing, but it does not account for how you have
been doing them."</p>

<p>"Do you know, Geraldine," said Tydvil, "that though you are a
very beautiful girl, a charming girl, and a very nice girl, you
have become a nuisance. I'm sorry to say it, but you have."</p>

<p>"Dismissed?" She lifted her delicate brows.</p>

<p>"No fear!" he said hastily. "I want you near me at present in
case you get into mischief. Besides, I don't want to lose my
secretary until I must."</p>

<p>"What I want to know is," she said, "how?"</p>

<p>He looked at her speculatively for some moments, and said, "I
think I will even tell you that."</p>

<p>Geraldine looked a little startled. "Perhaps I had better not
know," she ventured.</p>

<p>"I think otherwise. Listen..." For ten minutes Tydvil spoke in
quiet level tones, unwinding a story that brought first
amazement, that changed gradually to consternation, and then to
something like terror, into Geraldine's eyes. Preposterous as the
story was, she felt instinctively that he was telling the
truth.</p>

<p>When he had finished, Tydvil leaned back in his chair
regarding Geraldine's horrified face with evident amusement.</p>

<p>Presently she recovered herself and, in an awed voice, said,
"And you signed that note, and you were the other Billy, and
Basil Williams!" It was more amazement than a question, but
Tydvil nodded acquiescence to each sentence.</p>

<p>"Oh!" She clasped her hands. "How could you do such an awful
thing?"</p>

<p>He laughed lightly. "I think it's a lark. You see, Geraldine,
you could never understand why I did it unless you had been
brought up as I have been, and lived as I have lived."</p>

<p>"But, it's such a dreadful price to pay!"</p>

<p>"Pha! I'm in no worse position than millions of others, who
won't get half as much fun out of the deal as I've had."</p>

<p>"But suppose," she said, "he does everything, you will have no
hope if that bill falls due&mdash;others have."</p>

<p>"My troubles!" smiled Tydvil lightly.</p>

<p>"And he is that Mr. Senior?"</p>

<p>Tydvil nodded. "Impressive looking, is he not?"</p>

<p>"I felt that day when he came to the office as though&mdash;"
Geraldine paused for words, "as though I was near something
electric&mdash;some vast machine."</p>

<p>"He does give that impression of power," Tydvil admitted,
"but, believe me, Geraldine, he's a splendid man, and he's been a
jolly good and understanding pal to me."</p>

<p>"But why," asked Geraldine, "have you told me all this?"</p>

<p>Tydvil pursed his lips. "For one thing, you have been
exasperatingly clever enough to find out far more than you should
have. Another thing is, that I trust you."</p>

<p>"Trust me!"</p>

<p>He nodded. "You must see that you dare not tell anyone,
except, perhaps, that Billy of yours, and that won't matter."</p>

<p>He waited for the comment she did not make, and continued,
"Suppose you tried to tell. Remember, I am Tydvil Jones,
Merchant, reformer, a public man of proved integrity. You and
Billy are two of my employees. I should be exceedingly
sympathetic toward your extraordinary obsession, and would
generously make provision for you while you are under restraint,
and until you are released, happily cured."</p>

<p>Forgetting herself for the moment, Geraldine exclaimed,
"Tyddie, you're a devil!" Then, seeing the expression on his
face, she said hurriedly, "Oh! I beg your pardon, Mr. Jones, that
just slipped out."</p>

<p>Tydvil laughed heartily. "Please, please don't spoil it by
apologising&mdash;I like it. You all call me Tyddie, I know."</p>

<p>"But..."</p>

<p>"No buts! While we are together you must retain the Tyddie;
aren't we fellow conspirators?"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. "You're hopeless." Then, after a
moment, "But what about the synthetic Billy and Mrs. Jones?"</p>

<p>Tydvil was rubbing the palm of his left hand absently, and
looked up. "I'm afraid, Geraldine, that that is a matter I cannot
discuss with you."</p>

<p>"Since we are being honest with one another," she replied
vigorously, "I hope you get all you deserve out of that little
plan. And I hope it will be a shock."</p>

<p>"If anyone gets a shock out of it, I don't think I'll be the
one."</p>

<p>"Maybe, but you're the one who deserves it."</p>

<p>"Shucks!" growled Mr. Jones. "Don't babble, Geraldine." Then,
"Would you like to meet my friend Mr. Senior?"</p>

<p>"I most certainly would not."</p>

<p>"He admires you immensely. He warned me all along that you
would bowl me out."</p>

<p>"If he were sitting in that chair," Geraldine nodded to the
visitor's armchair, "I'd tell him just what I think of him."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be surprised if he had been sitting in that chair
all the time we've been talking." Tydvil smiled at her.</p>

<p>Geraldine stared at the chair in alarm.</p>

<p>"Am I right, Nicholas?" Tydvil addressed the empty chair.</p>

<p>"Quite correct, Tydvil." Nicholas in person smiled from one to
the other with engaging candour.</p>

<p>Geraldine was beyond speech. She stared, and hers was a
hostile stare.</p>

<p>Mr. Senior's eyes turned on her were quite friendly and
conciliating. "I'm afraid you will think my conduct unpardonable,
Miss Brand," he began.</p>

<p>Geraldine suddenly found her lost voice and interjected, "It
is! Quite unpardonable!"</p>

<p>Nicholas disregarded the hostility and the interjection. "You
see, I could not resist the temptation of being present at your
interview with Tydvil."</p>

<p>"It is a pity your courtesy is not as great as your
curiosity," retorted the uncompromising Geraldine. "Geraldine!"
exclaimed Tydvil in protest.</p>

<p>"You keep out of this, Tyddie," snapped the girl, her claws
bared for battle.</p>

<p>The eyes of Nicholas sparkled with mirth as he glanced at
Tyddie. "It's a private fight, Tydvil," he chuckled.</p>

<p>"And we don't want a referee, either," added Geraldine.
"Rafferty rules," conceded Nicholas.</p>

<p>"Now!" She turned on Nicholas, head high and battle in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"What I wished to explain was, that I was not apparent because
I thought my presence might interfere with your freedom of
speech." His smile deepened as he added, gently, "I admit,
misjudging your diffidence."</p>

<p>She let the jab go by unnoticed. "All I want to say to you is
that I think this abominable contract into which you have
inveigled Mr. Jones is entirely worthy of you and your
reputation."</p>

<p>Nicholas raised his eyebrows. "Have you heard Mr. Jones making
any complaint?"</p>

<p>"You know, as well as I do, that he has no idea of what he has
done," she insisted.</p>

<p>"Dear lady," his voice was aggravatingly patient, "don't you
think you are rather overworking your sex's congenital
inconsistency?"</p>

<p>Geraldine began to see red. "Don't you dare to address me as
'Dear lady'..."</p>

<p>He interposed: "The adjective is entirely respectful, and I
trust you do not reject the noun."</p>

<p>"It is because I accept the noun, I have ref rained from
calling you all that you deserve&mdash;and are." She pushed out a
belligerent chin.</p>

<p>"I should feel more grateful for your restraint, Miss Brand,
were I not aware that it was the charge of inconsistency, and not
the 'Dear lady' that caused you to boil over," retorted the
unabashed Nicholas. "It was the major truth that hurt."</p>

<p>"The charge of inconsistency is as false as your friend-ship
with Mr. Jones," she came back at him.</p>

<p>"Out of your own mouth you prove me Tydvil's friend."</p>

<p>"You may fool him, but not me," she retorted.</p>

<p>"And yet you, both with yourself and your fiance, have agreed
that since Tydvil has been released from his inhibitions through
my agency, he is much more human, much more likeable, and a much
better and natural man."</p>

<p>"That was when I was unaware of the price he had paid for his
release."</p>

<p>Nicholas shook his head slowly. "No, no, Miss Brand, be
honest. Even with that knowledge, you still like the new Tydvil
better than the old. Telling fibs to me is a most unprofitable
pastime."</p>

<p>"I'm not telling fibs, as you call them," she asserted
angrily.</p>

<p>"Oh, Geraldine! Geraldine!" said Mr. Senior reprovingly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Senior can read your thoughts, Geraldine," warned Tydvil
from across the table.</p>

<p>Geraldine sat up. There was consternation in her face, over
which a deep flush spread. "Oh, you..." she gasped. Then,
recovering herself, she said defiantly, "Well, if you can read my
thoughts, I hope you liked them."</p>

<p>"I must confess that I did not like them very much," Nicholas
admitted. "They were very rude, and it is surprising, even to me,
how such a nice girl could even think of such words. But I can be
tolerant and make allowances for your unjust prejudices. You see,
Miss Brand, despite your conviction to the contrary, I am quite
truthful."</p>

<p>"Prejudices! Indeed!" Geraldine bridled.</p>

<p>"And yet you owe me something, Miss Brand," said</p>

<p>Nicholas.</p>

<p>"I owe you something!"</p>

<p>He nodded. "Your Mr. Brewer was, in justice and in law, my
property, and you stepped in and took him out of my hands without
as much as 'by your leave'."</p>

<p>"I'm delighted to hear it," said Geraldine sincerely. "Well, I
was very much annoyed," admitted Nicholas. "And I am more
delighted still to hear that."</p>

<p>"So I am aware." He was smiling almost derisively. "And if I
can grab Tyddie from you, I'll do that, too!" she said with
spirit.</p>

<p>Nicholas turned to Tydvil. "Jove, Tydvil! There's nothing in
humanity like the flaming zest of these red-heads for a fight."
Then, to Geraldine, "Miss Brand, it's refreshing to meet an
honest fighter who comes out into the open. My old opponents, the
churchmen, who resort to poison gas and more poisonous
propaganda, have never fought fairly. I admire your spirit."</p>

<p>"Flattery now!" said Geraldine wrinkling her dainty nose.
"That reminds me of a saying of my grandfather which amused the
family when he became excited."</p>

<p>"May we hear it?" Mr. Senior enquired.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Geraldine politely. "In moments of stress
the old boy always exclaimed: 'May the devil admire me!"</p>

<p>"Personalities apart, Geraldine," commented Nicholas, "there
are not may of the race that I do admire."</p>

<p>"If you don't like personalities, Mr. Senior, please refrain
from remarks about the colour of my hair, as for the rest, I do
not echo, nor ever have echoed, my grandfather's peculiar
wish."</p>

<p>Nicholas laughed. "I've known millions of your sisters who
have not agreed with you."</p>

<p>"Poor mutts!" replied Geraldine flatly.</p>

<p>"And," said Nicholas regretfully, "I was hoping that apart
from our sentimental animosities, we could call a truce and be
friends."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a hope you can forget. There's nothing doing,
Mr. Senior," she replied decisively.</p>

<p>"Couldn't I induce you and Mr. Brewer to dine with me and Mr.
Basil Williams at Menzies this evening?" Nicholas coaxed.</p>

<p>She shook her red mane emphatically.</p>

<p>"Because," and a mischievous smile danced round the corners of
her mouth, "there was never a spoon made long enough for my needs
in such circumstances."</p>

<p>The two men laughed heartily at the thrust. Said Nicholas,
when he had recovered his gravity, "Do you know what I think,
Miss Brand?"</p>

<p>"Not having your peculiar gift, I don't," replied
Geraldine.</p>

<p>"Well," said Nicholas, "I think there may be times after your
marriage when Billy may regret that he slipped out of my
hands."</p>

<p>"Should I ever catch him hankering after the world, the flesh
and you, I can promise you that he will."</p>

<p>There was such a ring of sincerity in her voice, that Mr.
Senior felt a twinge of pity for Billy.</p>

<p>"Then it is war?" he smiled.</p>

<p>She looked steadily into the compelling, luminous eyes. "Yes!
War!"</p>

<p>She stood up and gathered her baskets in her arm. "And I'm
wasting my time, and you're about the only one who could make me
do that."</p>

<p>Nicholas bowed ironically. "You flatter me, Miss Brand."</p>

<p>She took no notice of the remark, but walked round the table
and stood beside Tydvil, looking down on him. "Well?" he said,
turning his face up.</p>

<p>She placed her disengaged hand affectionately on his shoulder.
"Oh, Tyddie! Tyddie," she said gently, "you have been an ass! But
I understand."</p>

<p>"Friends?" asked Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Always!" she nodded.</p>

<p>She walked towards the door, and Nicholas started to his feet
and opened it for her. Head up and defiant, she paused on the
threshold, "And if I don't make you discount that infernal bill
of yours, it won't be for want of trying."</p>

<p>"That, I am sure of." He bowed as to royalty and closed the
door on her exit.</p>

<p>Nicholas resumed his seat and the two regarded one another
with smiles.</p>

<p>"Not much change out of her," was Tydvil's comment.</p>

<p>"You know," said Nicholas thoughtfully, "it's fortunate for me
that there are not more like her. But, dash it all, Tydvil, I
like her."</p>

<p>"She'll make Billy Brewer a good wife," ventured Tydvil.
"She'll make him a far better husband," chuckled Nicholas.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p>It was a fascinated Billy who listened to Geraldine's story of
her interview with Tydvil and Nicholas that evening. Said he, at
the close of the narrative, "By Jove, Gerry, I'd like to slam
that Nicholas bird in the jaw."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't advise you to try, Billy," she laughed. "And
besides, after all, his behaviour was really courteous and
friendly."</p>

<p>"Dashed cheek asking us to dinner, I think," growled
Billy.</p>

<p>She ran her fingers through his hair. "Here's a confession.
I'd have loved to have accepted that invitation. I think a dinner
with Mr. Senior would be delightful&mdash;while it lasted."</p>

<p>"Gerry!"</p>

<p>"But I didn't accept; too risky." There was a trace of regret
in her voice.</p>

<p>"Why, if you had, Tyddie as Basil Williams might have landed
the lot of us in quod." Billy was not mollified.</p>

<p>"I doubt it, if I had been with you," Geraldine assured
him.</p>

<p>"Well," Billy said, "I know what a night out is, but from what
I heard about town of Basil Williams, I'm hanged if I'd risk a
binge with him."</p>

<p>"Don't you let me catch you at it, boy. Tyddie trying to catch
up with his lost youth is no companion for a nice Billy. Just
remember that!" She drew his head to her by his ear, and kissed
him lightly on the tip of the nose.</p>

<p>Billy submitted to treatment and grinned. "You bet I wouldn't
let you catch me!"</p>

<p>"Dog!" she said, snuggling closer to him, and for a time the
dialogue became incoherent.</p>

<p>Presently Geraldine sat up. "You know, Billy, I'm terribly
worried about Tyddie."</p>

<p>"But, Gerry," he said doubtfully, "do you really think the
story about the promissory note is true? Dash it all, this is the
twentieth century, not the middle ages."</p>

<p>"Think I'm cracked if you like, but I am positive it is true,"
she asserted.</p>

<p>"Well, if it's true, as you think, I don't like Tyddie's
chance of meeting it when it falls due." There was concern in
Billy's voice.</p>

<p>"That's the maddening part of it." Geraldine's voice reflected
her anxiety. "If we told about it, everyone would think we are
crazy, and there does not seem a hope of getting out of it."</p>

<p>"If that Nicholas bird can change Tyddie into any shape he
likes, I guess there is nothing he can't do."</p>

<p>"Nothing, absolutely nothing! And the worst of it is," she
added, "Tyddie does not seem to care, or to be trying to save
himself."</p>

<p>"Hold on a moment," Billy exclaimed. "What about the old
legends? There was generally a way out of those contracts!"</p>

<p>"That's just it. They're legends and nothing else," said
Geraldine.</p>

<p>"But if Nicholas is what you say he is, you might try swatting
him with a Bible, or getting him into Church or some gag like
that," Billy ventured hopefully.</p>

<p>"Oh, those stories are all just church propaganda! Don't you
ever read the papers, Billy?" she asked disdainfully.</p>

<p>"What the dickens have the papers to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Just this," she said scornfully, "if you had read them you
would know that Mr. Nicholas Senior has given a Pleasant Sunday
afternoon address on the modern apathy towards religion. That he
had addressed the Anglican Synod, and he has been advocating in
or for half the Churches in Melbourne."</p>

<p>Billy laughed. "Jove! He's a sportsman, at any rate."</p>

<p>"You can be sure there's something in his being able to cite
Scripture for his own purpose. Shakespeare did not guess that.
No, Billy," Geraldine went on, "we'll have to think of something
practical."</p>

<p>A bright idea struck Billy. "Listen, darlint, give Tyddie the
tip to ask him to shift St. Paul's Cathedral on to the sit of St.
Patrick's, and St. Patrick's on to the site of St. Paul's."</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd, Billy," laughed Geraldine.</p>

<p>"That's not absurd," Billy contended eagerly. "If Nicholas
couldn't do it, Tyddie would be saved, and if he could do it,
think what a lark it would be?"</p>

<p>"Idiot! I'm trying to save Tyddie, not to start a war of
religion."</p>

<p>"Ump!" admitted Billy. "I suppose something like that would
happen when each side began blaming the other."</p>

<p>"But there must be something," Geraldine urged. "Think,
Billy."</p>

<p>"I'm done, Gerry," acknowledged Billy, "much as I like to help
Tyddie, it looks like a blue duck to me."</p>

<p>"But he must be vulnerable somewhere," Geraldine stared at the
carpet with knit brows.</p>

<p>Billy leaned his ruffled head on her shoulders. "Righto,
angel! You think up his vulnerable spot and tell your Billy all
about it, and I promise to swat him right on it."</p>

<p>But the days slipped by, and Geraldine was no nearer a
solution of her problem. She had other things to think about,
too, for Cranston v. Cranston, Brewer co-respondent, was
pending.</p>

<p>When that case came before the Court, the newspapers
temporarily forgot the international situation, for Cranston,
Cranston and Brewer became news. After the first of the three
days during which the hearing lasted, Mr. Justice Mainwaring, who
heard it (but doubted his ears, as well as all the witnesses),
felt impelled to emit some blistering judicial comment on the
behaviour of the horde of sensation-hungry people who stormed the
Law Court's draughty corridors in the hope of obtaining admission
to his Court.</p>

<p>Tydvil was more worried over the outcome of the case than he
was about his own immediate problems. Billy's solicitors had
instructed Mr. Max Mendax, K.C., for the co-respondent.
Privately, however, Tydvil had instructed Mr. Nicholas Senior, to
intervene&mdash;not in court, but by using his influence in any
manner he thought advisable, ethically or otherwise, to insure a
verdict against the petitioner.</p>

<p>Mr. Senior had accepted the brief from Tydvil with some ironic
comment on the situation. "You know, Tydvil," he remarked, "that
red-headed demon of yours would never believe it, but I am glad
to fight on her side. But..."</p>

<p>"Now what mischief are you up to, Nicholas?" Tydvil was
suspicious of the chuckle that accompanied Nicholas' remark.</p>

<p>"Nothing!" said Nicholas evasively. "I take it that you want
that Cranston person to get it in the neck."</p>

<p>"Just that," Tydvil agreed. "But you know, Nicholas, I have a
feeling, from my brief acquaintanceship with the lad in the case,
that Cranston's allegations are not without foundation."</p>

<p>He looked up and caught Nicholas's amused eyes on him. "Dash
it all, Nicholas, don't look at me like that. You know as well as
I do that..."</p>

<p>"Cranston arrived with his merry men too soon," Nicholas cut
in.</p>

<p>"Confound you," Tydvil laughed in spite of himself, "haven't
you any faith in human nature."</p>

<p>"Yes!" replied Nicholas judicially. "Even I have some left,
and that, my friend, is a very high tribute coming from me."</p>

<p>"Well, don't sit there grinning at me in that superior
manner," Tydvil growled.</p>

<p>"Tydvil," Nicholas took a cigarette from his case, "I do
assure you that I have faith in human nature, but very little
faith in&mdash;let me see&mdash;what was it&mdash;ah
yes&mdash;two large scotches, a cocktail, sherry, three glasses
of champagne and a benedictine. There is a certain virtue in that
blend, but not the kind you required on that particular
evening."</p>

<p>Tydvil smiled reminiscently. "I was a victim of circumstances;
a fragment of life caught and tossed about in a whirlpool of
chance."</p>

<p>"It sounds quite poetical when you put it that way," said
Nicholas tossing a match into the grate. "But there are certain
less poetically minded people&mdash;people like Billy Brewer, for
instance&mdash;who would say that you went on a binge and made a
night of it."</p>

<p>"Vulgar people, perhaps, would look at it that way," Tydvil
agreed. "But why split hairs. To get back to the respondent. It
is possible that some link with Brewer's earlier association with
Hilda Cranston may be forged in court that would lead to justice
being done that I doubt if Mr. Cranston deserves."</p>

<p>"It seems as though we are forced into a highly immoral
position," observed Nicholas. "In order to prevent Cranston from
obtaining the justice you very rightly, say he does not deserve,
I, who by rights should side against the angels, must clog the
wheels of the law to aid them."</p>

<p>"I'm sure the angels will be relieved," said Tydvil, "to see
you doing good by stealth, especially if you blush to find it
fame."</p>

<p>"Should anything go wrong, you would be the one to do the
blushing," grinned Nicholas. "However, I accept the outrage to my
professional ethics."</p>

<p>"What about the gentleman of the bar?" asked Tydvil.</p>

<p>"I have compared the respective records of Mr. Max Mendax with
those of the counsel for the petitioner and respondent. In
professional attainments and lack of scruple there is not much to
choose between them."</p>

<p>"Then you will have no trouble&mdash;it will be two to one,"
Tydvil suggested.</p>

<p>"That will be a factor in our favour," agreed Nicholas. "But
only Mr. Justice Mainwaring and I are aware of the extent to
which he is indebted to me&mdash;in fact I am depending largely
on such suggestions as I will make to him during the hearing. Of
course, I can prompt counsel where necessary also."</p>

<p>"Well, I leave it to you with perfect confidence," said Tydvil
relieved.</p>

<p>Nicholas nodded. "I have already, influenced Mr. Mendax
against his first decision to call you as a witness." Tydvil
whistled. "Thanks for the escape."</p>

<p>"Yes," Nicholas went on, "after he had gone through his brief
I suggested to him that your evidence would sound so fishy under
cross-examination, that it would not be safe to put you in the
box."</p>

<p>"What a friend you are, Nicholas." There was a hint of sarcasm
in his voice.</p>

<p>Nicholas grinned in response. "More than you think, my boy.
There's a dashed inquisitive police inspector at Russell Street
who is becoming more and more convinced that Tydvil Jones knows
more than he should know about Basil Williams. And," he added,
"if you had any trouble in the witness box, he might find out
more than you would care for him to know."</p>

<p>"Rats to him!" Tydvil was unconcerned. "Let him find out what
he likes. Nice ass he would look if he tried to place the facts
before a bench of magistrates."</p>

<p>"There's something in that," agreed Nicholas. "But, in any
case, you may make your mind easy about Brewer."</p>

<p>There was one other person who was profoundly distressed by
the impending case. Amy, who was not usually a reader of the Law
List, happened to notice the name "Brewer" as she skimmed over
her paper. In its association with that of Cranston, and
remembering the police court case, her perturbation was natural.
Never during her association with William, had the subject been
mentioned between them. Now, jealousy entered her soul.</p>

<p>For her own reasons, Amy was a little shy at questioning
Tydvil on the subject. Latterly the extraordinary change in her
husband had been causing her no little concern. By some means
that were beyond her comprehension, he had succeeded in escaping
her authority. He was truculent under cross-examination, and his
language to her had occasionally, been almost vulgar. He
absolutely refused to explain his almost constant absences from
his dinner in the evening and his chronically late hours.
Moreover, he was completely neglecting his social services in a
most distressing manner.</p>

<p>Only that morning, when she had reminded him that she had
arranged for him to address a meeting of the committee of the
Little Mothers' Guild at the Vicarage, he had replied that if she
thought he was going to waste his time lapping milk with a bunch
of she cats, she was dashed well mistaken.</p>

<p>Her indignant, but, in the circumstances, restrained rebuke,
had called forth a most disgraceful analogy regarding she cats
and little mothers that had shocked Amy inexpressibly.</p>

<p>However, her curiosity regarding the case prompted her to
bring up the subject at breakfast on the following morning.
Breakfast was now about the only time at which she could be sure
of meeting her husband.</p>

<p>Seizing what she thought was a favourable opportunity to break
in on his attention to his newspaper, she said, "Oh, Tydvil dear!
I saw in yesterday's paper that there was a divorce case coming
on in which Cranston and Brewer are mentioned. I trust that is
not the Mr. Brewer you employ."</p>

<p>"Yes it is, and the Mr. Cranston, too," replied Tydvil
shortly. "What of it?"</p>

<p>"But, my dear Tydvil, I can scarcely believe it," she
protested.</p>

<p>"Why not?" came from the opposite end of the table. The voice
was quite indifferent.</p>

<p>"Well, I thought that your Mr. Brewer was such a superior
man," Amy ventured. "What is it all about?"</p>

<p>Tydvil, scarcely looking up from his paper, gave her a brief
resume of Cranston's allegations in English so plain that Amy
blushed.</p>

<p>"Tydvil!" she exclaimed in shocked amazement. "Well, you asked
me!"</p>

<p>"But, surely, to your wife, you might have chosen your words
more carefully," she protested angrily.</p>

<p>"Look here, Amy," he said impatiently, "however the matter is
put it means the same thing."</p>

<p>"It appears to me, Tydvil dear, you are strangely indifferent
on such a grave matter."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do? Weep?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I should have thought that if there were any ground for such
a charge you would have taken strong action," she said
severely.</p>

<p>"Poppycock!" said Tydvil rudely. "How the deuce do I know if
there is any ground for it until the case is heard?"</p>

<p>"I, for one, don't believe it for a moment," Amy asserted with
conviction.</p>

<p>"Pha! What do you know about it?" Outwardly, Tydvil was
derisive. Inwardly he was bubbling with mischievous mirth.</p>

<p>"From the little I've seen of him, that Mr. Brewer seemed a
very nice man, not the kind to be involved in such a disgraceful
affair," said Amy warmly.</p>

<p>"And that," retorted Tydvil, "just shows what a rotten judge
of character you are. Brewer's the best salesman in town, but
from what I hear, he makes love to every woman he meets."</p>

<p>Had Tydvil thrown a brick at Amy he could not have given her a
greater shock. But she would not believe him. For the remainder
of the meal, she enlarged on the subject of gossip and scandal.
She held no brief for Mr. Brewer, she asserted, but Tydvil should
not listen to such statements, much less repeat them.</p>

<p>Tydvil suffered the lecture with carefully veiled amusement.
He refrained from replying or defending himself. He had shot his
dart, and was content to let it rankle. And he could tell from
her voice that it did rankle.</p>

<p>Later that day, Amy's wounded feelings received their much
needed balm from the clear-eyed assurance of a young man in the
Botanic Gardens, that he was the victim of malice and a mistaken
identity. On his honour, he vowed that he had only met Mrs.
Cranston once in his life, and had never felt the slightest
desire to meet her again.</p>

<p>Later in life, Mr. Justice Mainwaring was wont to refer to
Cranston v. Cranston as a case peculiar for the consistency and
brazen quality of its perjury.</p>

<p>Once more the battle raged round the black-eye of William
Brewer. For three hours in the witness box, Cranston blackened
Billy's character by adhering to his statement that William
Brewer of Craddock, Burns and Despard, and no other, was his
wife's companion at his home on that night in August. He had
known Brewer for twelve years and could not be mistaken. At the
time of their encounter, Brewer did not have a black eye. If he
had one later in the evening, it had been obtained in a scuffle
that had occurred in Cranston's home, or, perhaps, in his attack
on other witnesses.</p>

<p>Despite Mr. Mendax's gruelling cross-examination Cranston
stuck to his guns that the visitor he had found in his house was
Brewer. The two private detectives backed their employer
vigorously. They knew Brewer well by appearance. Mr. Mendax had
not much trouble with the pursuing witnesses, though, they
asserted roundly that the Brewer in court was the man they had
pursued.</p>

<p>The policeman, who had not forgotten the assault on his person
or his dignity, was emphatic, as he saw the corespondent under
the lights at the corner of Acland and Fitzroy Streets, that he
could not be mistaken in the man, though he admitted the one he
arrested did have a black eye.</p>

<p>At the close of the case for the petitioner the outlook for
Billy Brewer was decidedly sombre.</p>

<p>Things began to look up, however, when Billy accounted for his
movements on the night in question. When he was backed staunchly
by his host and hostess of the evening, who stuck to the black-
eyed Brewer and all his works, Mr. Justice Mainwaring began to be
peevish.</p>

<p>When counsel for the petitioner endeavoured to discredit them
by asking whether one Tydvil Jones, merchant of Melbourne, had
not given evidence in another court to the effect that Brewer had
been working in his office until late on the night in question,
Mr. Mendax intervened. In the ensuing legal dogfight, during
which Mr. Justice Mainwaring severely rebuked both counsel, the
question was disallowed. He suggested that either side had been
entitled to call the witness Jones if they wished.</p>

<p>Miss Geraldine Brand went into the witness box with some
trepidation but with her chin up.</p>

<p>Yes she was well acquainted with the co-respondent.</p>

<p>Unhurriedly and precisely she related that she had seen a man,
who closely resembled Brewer, speaking to the respondent close to
His Majesty's Theatre at 8 o'clock on the night in question.</p>

<p>She was certain it was not Brewer, because he did not have a
black eye.</p>

<p>It was when Geraldine was handed over to counsel for the
petitioner for cross-examination that something impelled her to
turn her eyes to the spectators in court. They fell on a very
distinguished head with a touch of grey on either temple. The
eyes belonging to the head were alive with amusement. Geraldine
was suddenly seized with a burning desire to poke out her tongue
at that very distinguished head.</p>

<p>So far she had escaped without embarrassment, but she felt the
presence of Mr. Senior boded no good.</p>

<p>As counsel rose to his feet and tossed back his gown, she
distinctly heard a voice whisper close to her ear, "Is it still
war?"</p>

<p>She knew that voice, and she gave her thoughts free rein
regarding its owner. Had they become vocal she would have
staggered the court. That they reached their intended destination
she was aware from the smile that twitched at Mr. Senior's
lips.</p>

<p>Again the voice whispered very distinctly: "War it is! I have
just put an idea into that learned gentleman's head that is going
to make you very uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Brand," grated counsel. "You say you have known the
co-respondent, Brewer, for five years?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you think you could not have been mistaken in saying that
it was not Brewer who you saw near the theatre?"</p>

<p>"I am certain it was not."</p>

<p>"Because he did not possess this famous black eye we have
heard so much about?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"At what time did you first see Brewer that day?"</p>

<p>"About nine o'clock."</p>

<p>"Where was he then?"</p>

<p>"In Mr. Jones's private office."</p>

<p>"Were you alone with him?"</p>

<p>As Geraldine faltered "Yes," mingled fear and anger came to
her. She felt sure she knew who was the actual questioner.</p>

<p>"Did he have the black eye then, Miss Brand?"</p>

<p>Geraldine glanced towards Nicholas. As she did, a voice said
gently in her ear, "I'll teach you to call me approbrious names,
you red-headed baggage."</p>

<p>Turning to counsel, she snapped, "You cowardly brute!"</p>

<p>"How dare you address counsel in such terms!" thundered Mr.
Justice Mainwaring in the sensation caused by her outbreak.</p>

<p>More staggered than His Honour was Geraldine, who had
involuntarily hurled at counsel the thought she intended for
Nicholas, instead of the "No" she wished to say. "I beg your
Honour's pardon, I did not mean to say that," she stammered.</p>

<p>"If there is any further misconduct of the kind, witness, I
warn you I will deal with you very severely," glared the outraged
Judge.</p>

<p>"Please, your Honour! I was upset because there is a man in
the body of the court making most insulting gestures at me,"
Geraldine asserted vehemently.</p>

<p>"A man in...Point him out to me, witness!" snapped the
Judge.</p>

<p>There was triumph in Geraldine's heart as she turned and
pointed. "It is the tall, dark man, third from that end in the
second row."</p>

<p>All eyes in court were turned on the spot she indicated.</p>

<p>His Honour stared, and then stared at Geraldine suspiciously.
"Which tall, dark man, witness?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"The third from the end, sir! The clean shaven man with the
dark eyes," she said eagerly.</p>

<p>Once again Mr. Justice Mainwaring stared from spot to witness
and back again. "Stand up that third man from the end of the
second row."</p>

<p>Mr. Senior stood at attention.</p>

<p>"Is that the tall, dark, clean-shaven man?" fairly roared His
Honour.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" Then her nerve almost broke. As she looked back
from the bench she saw a small, bent figure of a shabby old man
standing where, a moment before, Nicholas had towered. He had a
long, straggly beard, and his weak grey eyes were magnified with
large, thick glasses.</p>

<p>From the bench behind the bar table, she saw Billy's face
turned up to her in uncomprehending consternation.</p>

<p>Then her eyes turned back to Mr. Justice Mainwaring, whose
aspect was so far from benevolent that she looked hastily away
again.</p>

<p>"Witness," came a cold, uncompromising voice from the bench,
"I fail to understand whether you are trifling with the court,
whether this is very ill-timed impertinence, or whether you are
in your right mind. But&mdash;if you dare to repeat your
extraordinary behaviour I shall commit you for contempt. Indeed,
I think I am too lenient in not doing so now. Proceed, Mr.
Bingleton!"</p>

<p>As His Honour concluded his tribute to Geraldine, came again
the still small voice in her ear: "You should have brought that
long spoon into court with you, Geraldine, my dear."</p>

<p>"You say, Miss Brand, that when you saw Brewer alone in Mr.
Jones's office at nine o'clock, he did not have a black eye?"</p>

<p>"That is so," she was much meeker.</p>

<p>"At what time did he acquire this decoration?"</p>

<p>"About twenty minutes later." How she hated that Nicholas.</p>

<p>"Did you witness the accident, Miss Brand?"</p>

<p>"Yes," faltered Geraldine. The thought of the next question
turned her cold.</p>

<p>"Just explain to the Court how it happened."</p>

<p>"He knocked it against something," she temporarised. "Against
something&mdash;what thing?"</p>

<p>There was a long pause.</p>

<p>"Come, come! Miss Brand, what was it?"</p>

<p>"Answer the question, witness!" from the bench. "My hand,"
faltered Miss Brand.</p>

<p>"Let us get this quite clear, witness," came Mr. Bingleton's
suave, persuasive voice. "Did Brewer knock against your hand, or
did your hand knock against Brewer?"</p>

<p>Geraldine sped a positively poisonous look at the man third
from the end of the second row in the body, of the court, and
answered, "My hand knocked against him."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Mr. Bingleton, as one who has made a pleasing
discovery.</p>

<p>"And did your hand happen to be clenched, Miss Brand?"</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured the miserable Geraldine, wishing she had Mr.
Senior somewhere free from observation.</p>

<p>"So, Miss Brand, we can assume that at about twenty minutes
past nine that morning, alone in Mr. Jones's office, you punched
the co-respondent in the eye so severely that you blackened
it?"</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>Mr. Bingleton took the silence for assent, and asked, in silky
tones, "Just why did you blacken Brewer's eye, Miss Brand?"</p>

<p>"For nothing," she answered desperately.</p>

<p>"Witness! Do you mean to tell the court that you are in the
habit of punching men in the eye for nothing?" severely demanded
Mr. Justice Mainwaring.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Geraldine weakly.</p>

<p>"Then I warn you not to prevaricate! Answer counsel's
question."</p>

<p>Geraldine took a fleeting look at Billy's face that was
registering intense sympathy.</p>

<p>"He kissed me!" The whispered words were distinct in the
silent court, and released a wave of laughter.</p>

<p>"Silence! Silence!" roared the orderly.</p>

<p>"If there is a repetition of that disgraceful behaviour I
shall have the court cleared!" thundered Mr. Justice
Mainwaring.</p>

<p>Geraldine's thoughts at the moment may be imagined from the
fact that those who were sitting on either side of the third man
from the end of the second row noticed that he started as though
something had stung him.</p>

<p>"So," continued Mr. Bingleton, "the co-respondent took
advantage of your unprotected state and kissed you, and you, in
defence of your outraged modesty, punched him in the eye."</p>

<p>Geraldine looked miserable, but made no reply.</p>

<p>"Well," he continued, "now we know all about the famous black
eye, and some more of the character of the co-respondent. Thank
you, Miss Brand, that will do."</p>

<p>The look Geraldine turned on Mr. Bingleton as she left the
witness box, convinced that gentleman that she was in a mood to
serve out another black eye, and that he could easily be its
recipient.</p>

<p>It was late that day, that Mr. Justice Mainwaring observed,
among other things, that the only fact that emerged from the
evidence was that all the witnesses were lying.</p>

<p>He utterly refused to believe any statement made by any one of
them. The witness Cranston was viciously malicious. His two
detectives were men whose characters forbade credence. He held
his own opinion on the reluctance of both sides to call in the
witness from the lesser court, Tydvil Jones, who might have
thrown some light on the slimy morass of evasion and falsehood.
Brewer might be innocent, but if so, he did not behave as an
innocent man. The silence of the respondent was a notable feature
of the case.</p>

<p>The court, he observed in conclusion, though willing to give
every consideration to fact, would not attempt to discriminate
among falsehoods. For that reason he dismissed the petition. Each
side should pay its own costs.</p>

<p>As Geraldine left the court, still boiling with fury, she
overtook Nicholas. "Devil!" she hissed in his ear.</p>

<p>"At your service, my dear young lady; now and always," he
smiled serenely.</p>

<a name="ch31"></a>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<p>It was little consolation to Geraldine that in both the
evening and morning papers the press photographers had done her
ample justice. The caption beneath the pictures of herself that
conspicuously decorated every account of the case, were
flattering but facetious. She did not like to see herself
described as "Geraldine Brand, the lovely girl with the lively
left." Beneath another she read, "Who wouldn't risk a black eye?"
But her sense of humour came to the rescue as she and Billy
discussed the events of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Billy was fighting mad when he heard of Nicholas's share in
her tribulations, and it was only with difficulty that she made
him recognise the utter futility of any attempt at reprisals.</p>

<p>Geraldine's own sentiments towards Mr. Senior were actually
less friendly than those of Billy. To her, it was clear that in
the Court, she alone, saw him as the tall, distinguished
stranger. To the others he must have appeared as the bent and
bearded septuagenarian. The exhibition she had made of herself in
her attempt at retaliation made her boil when she thought of it.
What perturbed her most was her own unquestioning acceptance of
Tydvil's explanation of Nicholas's identity, preposterous as it
was.</p>

<p>Despite that knowledge, she wondered at her lack of fear.
During her brief interview with Nicholas in Tydvil's room she had
experienced a fascination she could not resist. Again, as on her
first encounter, she had felt the impact of power that radiated
from him. Behind the banter of his words, and the sardonic humour
of his eyes, she sensed something terrible that was beyond her
comprehension. Whatever it was it did not affect her as being
evil, nor had it frightened her. Her feeling was more of awe than
anything else.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, intuition warned her that there was peril in the
fascination he exercised. A shudder went through her at the
thought of the possibilities that might be masked by the almost
irresistibly attractive humanity he had assumed. Tydvil, she
recognised, had taken him at his face value. Geraldine was not
deeply religious. Her wholesome conscience was her chief guide
and guardian. Her common sense rejected the principle of evil as
being embodied in horns, hooves and barbed tail as ludicrous. She
felt that the Nicholas Senior she had met could be more dangerous
than any composite zoological creation of mediaeval
ecclesiastical imagination.</p>

<p>Since knowledge of the truth regarding Tydvil had come to her,
she had turned over in her mind the incongruousness of Nicholas
busying himself with Tydvil's petty affairs and escapades. It
seemed like using, a mountain to crush a gnat, until she
reflected that Tydvil would be but one among millions who were
being affected by the same influence, unseen and unknown to
her.</p>

<p>But there had gradually grown up in her a fierce determination
to save Tydvil in spite of himself. It was more a desperate
resolve to match herself against the unseen force than to protect
Tydvil from the consequences of his folly. Her animosity against
Nicholas Senior had become violently personal. He had roused a
dauntless spirit that nested under her flaming helmet. Taking
Nicholas on his own valuation she argued to herself that he must
be vulnerable. Nothing was invulnerable in the Universe but the
will of its Creator. Therefore, somewhere, Nicholas had a spot
through which he could be struck.</p>

<p>But her first obstacles were in Billy, who looked askance at
her taking the risk of fighting Nicholas, and in Tydvil himself,
who was either blind or indifferent to her peril.</p>

<p>Though Billy was deeply impressed by Nicholas's activities,
his antagonism was very human and natural. He urged on Gerry that
Nicholas was a nasty bit of work with which she had no need to
become involved.</p>

<p>"Look, Gerry!" he said when they discussed the question, "if
Tyddie is mug enough to get himself mixed up with all the devils
in Hades, why should you risk getting singed fighting his
battles?"</p>

<p>"Tell me," she demanded, "what I looked like yesterday when I
pointed out the tall, dark stranger to that old savage,
Mainwaring?"</p>

<p>Billy strove manfully, but failed to hide his mirth at the
recollection.</p>

<p>Geraldine reached for, and obtained, a firm handful of hair,
and shook her finger in a face that was incapable of evasion.
"Yes, Billy, laugh! Go on, laugh! I know I looked like a prize
idiot. Just as I did when I called that pompous ass Bingleton a
brute. He was, too. But who caused it all? Tell me that!"</p>

<p>"Crikey, Gerry!" gurgled Billy. "I didn't...Leggo my hair! Do
you want a bald husband?"</p>

<p>But Gerry, disregarding his protests, went on. "Nicholas
Senior He did it. He's the man I'm after. Do you think I'm
letting him get away with that?"</p>

<p>"Poor Devil!" grinned Billy as she relinquished her hold.
"He'll wish himself home again if you do get a strangle hold on
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, if only I knew how!" Her voice was deep in its sincerity
of purpose.</p>

<p>"Some of those evangelical parsons talk of wrestling with the
Devil," Billy ventured. "You might engage one to train you."</p>

<p>"Idiot!" murmured Geraldine. "Can't you think of
anything?"</p>

<p>"Come here!" He held out his arms and Gerry responded. As she
settled herself comfortably, he said, "How about trying to
persuade him to swap Tyddie for Amy? Then everyone would be
happy."</p>

<p>"Except Mr. Nicholas Senior. Do you think he's that sort of
fool?" she said disdainfully. "Would you swap Tyddie for
Amy?"</p>

<p>"Lord forbid!" replied Billy piously.</p>

<p>"Well, why should he? Although," she added, "I should think
Amy would be a far greater asset for his purposes."</p>

<p>"What I can't understand about Tyddie is why, if he did want
to go on the binge, he didn't come to me, instead of going to the
Devil." Billy's voice sounded as though he felt Tydvil's judgment
was at fault.</p>

<p>Smothered by the lapel of his coat, he heard a chuckle.
"What's so funny about that?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Nothing, dearest," came from his lapel. "I was just thinking
it might have amounted to the same thing."</p>

<p>"What you deserve is..." he began.</p>

<p>She raised her face to him.</p>

<p>There was a long pause, and then as he looked down into the
laughing eyes again, he said, "You didn't deserve that, anyway.
What you really deserve, is to be married to Nicholas
Senior&mdash; you'd make a fine pair."</p>

<p>"If he got what he deserved, he would be married to Amy."</p>

<p>"I didn't think you were so vindictive, Gerry."</p>

<p>"When I think of those two I could bite them both," she said.
"That cat, Amy, is just as much to blame for everything as
Nicholas is."</p>

<p>"Urn! Maybe you're right. Poor old Tyddie didn't have much
chance between them."</p>

<p>"And," she went on, "don't forget that clear Amy is under the
happy impression, that you, William Brewer, are her guilty
partner in her flaming romance!"</p>

<p>"Makes me scared stiff to think of it," Billy admitted. "Lord!
Who'd have thought that Tyddie would put that across dear
Amy?"</p>

<p>"I'm not worrying about her," Geraldine replied. "But if
Tyddie lets you in for any more trouble, I'm going to make him
wish he'd never been born."</p>

<p>"Yes, and if Amy gets hold of me in mistake for Tyddie, I'll
be wishing the same wish."</p>

<p>"Then, there will be three of you with but a single thought,"
Geraldine released herself. "Because, when I'm finished with Amy,
her outlook on life is going to be very bleak."</p>

<p>"There was a time," Billy observed as his eyes took in the
picture made by Gerry as she straightened her disordered hair
before the Tydvil's mirror, "when I had a reputation for enjoying
a scrap. But I was the dove of peace compared with you,
darlint."</p>

<p>"It's not fighting I love, Billy," she assured him.</p>

<p>He caught sight of the reflection of her face in the mirror. A
minute later he was shooed out of the room by a Geraldine who
demanded to be informed if he thought she had nothing to do but
comb her hair every five minutes.</p>

<p>When Tydvil arrived at the office that morning, his humour was
joyous and mischievous. He came in with the morning papers under
his arm, and placed them on the table without a word, but with
provocative intent. Each upturned page displayed a portrait of
his secretary. He left them there, an incitement to warfare
during the whole of their morning routine. As a challenge to
Geraldine's refusal to notice them, he paused now and again in
his dictation to admire his picture exhibition, and to compare
the portraits with the original.</p>

<p>Said Geraldine, as she began to collect her papers, "If you
had been a badly brought-up schoolboy, your behaviour might be
excusable; as the head of C. B. &amp; D., it's disgraceful."</p>

<p>"You're certainly in a position to criticise my behaviour."
His laugh was derisive. "Who was it used abusive language to an
eminent counsel? Who was it who tried to pull the leg of the
Supreme Court judge? Who was it nearly had herself run in for
contempt of court? You, to talk of disgraceful behaviour!"</p>

<p>"I suppose," her voice was full of menace, "you, and your very
distinguished and noble friend, Mr. Senior, have been enjoying
the ridicule I underwent."</p>

<p>"Well, yes," Tydvil responded. "To be honest, I think enjoying
is the correct word."</p>

<p>"It's refreshing to find you honest about anything these
days."</p>

<p>"The injury was apparently inflected by a blunt weapon;
probably a girl's tongue," said Tydvil to his blotting pad.
"Injury!" She sniffed disdainfully.</p>

<p>He leaned forward on his folded arms on his table. "You might
have been more conciliatory to Mr. Senior, you know, Geraldine.
Without holding a brief for him, you rather asked for what
happened."</p>

<p>"Conciliatory! You can do what you please, but understand
this, I'd rather be compromised by him any day than compromise
with him."</p>

<p>"You have no idea what a delightful companion he can be."</p>

<p>"It's for that very reason that I'm taking no risks," she
asserted. Then, pointing to the open papers on the table, she
went on, "Do you think I liked those?"</p>

<p>He grinned mischievously. "I would unhesitatingly accept your
assurance that you didn't." Then, after a pause, "There was
someone who liked them almost less than you did."</p>

<p>"I have one friend apparently."</p>

<p>"Not quite a friend, I'm afraid." He leaned back in his chair.
"To tell you the truth, it was a high moral authority who
suggested at length, and with some emphasis, that my secretary
was a blot on society and quite unfitted for intimate contact
with the proprietor of C. B. &amp; .D."</p>

<p>Danger signals flashed into Geraldine's face. "If I am
tainting the high moral atmosphere of C. B. &amp; D., and its
highly, moral proprietor, the sooner I remove the blot the
better."</p>

<p>"You dare, you wild cat, and by Jove, I'll&mdash;I'll sue you
for breach of contract or something awful!" He laughed.</p>

<p>"Do you think I'd let you house a blot on society?"</p>

<p>"Geraldine! In the first place, no Moral Authority, however
high, is allowed to interfere with my management of C. B.
&amp;.D. In the second place, despite the fury of your temper, I
like you too much to allow you to go." There was no mistaking the
sincerity of his voice as he smiled up at the angry girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tyddie, you are a mischievous demon!" The "Tyddie"
slipped out unconsciously.</p>

<p>"That's better! Friends again?" There was something of a
schoolboy in his engaging grin.</p>

<p>She laughed. "But what about the High Moral Authority?"</p>

<p>His eyes twinkled. "You may not believe it, Geraldine, but I
derive a considerable amount of enjoyment from frustrating the
High Moral Authority."</p>

<p>She looked at him speculatively. "Yes," she said slowly, "I
can quite believe that."</p>

<p>He started up. "Oh, by Jove, I'd almost forgotten! Sit down
again and take this note."</p>

<p>Geraldine resumed her seat, pencil in hand,</p>

<p>"Dear Sir," dictated Tydvil. "Will you kindly accept this as a
notification that I am disassociating myself from the activities
of your society, and desire my name to be removed from the list
of members?"</p>

<p>From his wallet Tydvil drew a paper and passed it over to
Geraldine. "You will find here a list of seventeen philanthropic
societies. I want you to send a copy of that note to the
Secretary of each one."</p>

<p>Geraldine stared up from the list to Tydvil. "I wonder," she
said thoughtfully, "what the High Moral Authority will say to
that?"</p>

<p>"It scarcely bears contemplation," chuckled Tydvil. "Well,"
commented Geraldine, "there are always Gippsland and the tall
timber."</p>

<p>She stood up and walked towards the door, but hesitated. Then
she returned and, walking round the table, stood beside it.</p>

<p>Seeing her indecision he looked up. "Come, Geraldine, out with
whatever it is."</p>

<p>"Do you know the date?" she asked.</p>

<p>He glanced at the date block on his table. "October 18th,
unless you have neglected to change my block. What of it?"</p>

<p>"There are just seventeen days before November the fourth."
Her voice was very serious.</p>

<p>His face was expressionless as he replied: "That will be the
day after Cup Day."</p>

<p>"Oh, please, please Tyddie, be serious!" she pleaded. "You
know you told me that that dreadful bill was due on the
fourth."</p>

<p>His eyes searched her face. "I believe, Geraldine, you really
are worried."</p>

<p>"Oh! How can I help being worried? You don't seem to realise;
you're blind to what it means. I&mdash;I want to help." The deep
concern for him was very real.</p>

<p>"Will you believe me when I say the prospect does not worry me
in the slightest degree?" There could be no doubt he meant what
he said.</p>

<p>"But..." she began.</p>

<p>"Listen, Geraldine," he interrupted, "I went into this with my
eyes wide open. It was a revolt against circumstances. I have
had, and will continue to have, my fun. I am not going to squeal
about the price of it."</p>

<p>"But, Tyddie," her voice told the affection she felt for him,
"there must be a way out. Would you not take it if there
were?"</p>

<p>Tydvil raised his eyebrows. "You're far more optimistic than I
am. In fact, the possibility of evading the bill is so remote
that I have never even considered it."</p>

<p>"But would you take the opportunity if there were one?"</p>

<p>"Well," he replied thoughtfully, "the wording of the
endorsement is explicit, so that I would be quite within my right
to do it, and," he added, "I quite believe Mr. Senior would
accept the situation philosophically."</p>

<p>"I doubt it." Geraldine wrinkled her dainty nose
disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Maybe you do, my dear girl," Tydvil smiled up at her, "but I
have always found him to be a gentleman and a sportsman in every
sense of the word." He paused and went on, "And that is more than
I can say of any single one of my former pious associates."</p>

<p>"Was it a sportsman who baited me yesterday?" Geraldine's
indignation flashed up.</p>

<p>Tydvil chuckled. "I admit it must have been rather harrowing
for you. But remember, you challenged him; and remember, too,
that he might as easily as have made the rebuke a thousand times
worse."</p>

<p>"Staggered at his own moderation, no doubt." Geraldine laughed
in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"Anyway," Tydvil said, "if I'm not worrying, you needn't."</p>

<p>"But I am worrying, and I'm going on worrying," persisted
Geraldine.</p>

<p>Tydvil raised his hands in surrender. "From toothache, flat
tyres and all contumacious women, Good Lord deliver us."</p>

<p>Mr. Tydvil Jones's private Secretary looked her employer
straight in the eye, and protruded the tip of a pink tongue at
him in deliberate derision as she turned towards the door. Far
from expressing anger at her rudeness, Mr. Tydvil Jones laughed
heartily at the gesture.</p>

<p>As her hand was on the door-knob he called, "Geraldine!"</p>

<p>She paused.</p>

<p>"I want you to give that Billy of yours a message."</p>

<p>"Well!"</p>

<p>"Tell him to put every penny he can spare on 'Thundercloud'
for the Cup," was the astonishing direction.</p>

<p>"You..." Geraldine's stock of vituperative reply was so unfit
for consumption that she left it unspoken. "Don't you know I'm
trying to break him of those habits?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"A dying flutter," persuaded Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Why should he?" she asked indignantly.</p>

<p>"Tell him I have one hundred pounds on," he grinned. "Perhaps
he can take a hint despite the puritan conscience of his
fiancee."</p>

<p>"He's saving for our home; and he won't waste his money that
way," she retorted.</p>

<p>"He'll be able to buy and furnish the house if he takes my
advice," replied the Vice-President of the Anti-Gambling
League.</p>

<p>"More likely to lose our house and furniture," she
retorted.</p>

<p>"The bookmakers are laying three hundred to one against
Thundercloud," murmured the voice of Tydvil the tempter. "Twenty
pounds carefully invested would return six thousand."</p>

<p>"I'll tell him no such thing," hissed the determined damsel as
she disappeared through the door, cutting the discussion
short.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as a cynical Tydvil expected, the advice did
reach Billy Brewer; not as a recommendation to accept it, but as
a warning against the wiles of Tydvil in particular, and against
backing horses in general.</p>

<p>Billy virtuously disclaimed any intention of gambling. In any
case, he alleged that his opinion of Thundercloud's chances for
the Cup was far more pessimistic than that of the bookmakers.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, however, he gave the matter furtive but
serious consideration. He had very scant respect of Thundercloud,
but he had a very great respect for Tydvil's conservatism in
money matters. He reflected that though Tyddie was lavish with
his money for charities, financing bookmakers to the extent of
one hundred pounds would not be likely to conform to his idea of
charity.</p>

<p>Tyddie must have had a tip from someone. Who? Nicholas Senior,
was the only answer to that question.</p>

<p>Next morning Billy spent some of his employer's time in
putting twenty pounds on Thundercloud with as many bookmakers.
One of these assured him cheerfully that the horse was not worth
half of the twenty shillings invested on him.</p>

<hr width="25%" align="center"> <p>It was by no means on moral
grounds that Amy had urged Tydvil to rid the office of the
miasmatic presence of that "Brand girl," as she elected to call
Geraldine. Amy was a very troubled and a very jealous woman. When
she read the story of Billy's black eye, that had been torn from
Geraldine in the witness box, Amy saw yellow.</p>

<p>The more she thought, the more bewildered she became. That
night William had sought refuge from a sudden indisposition, he
had not a black eye. Yet, unless that Brand girl had committed
perjury, he most certainly should have had one. Of course, that
Brand girl was just the sort or creature who would lure a man
into kissing her, and a woman like that would not hesitate to
perjure herself, Amy reasoned. Women of that type were a positive
menace to every man they met. Of course, Tydvil was too simple
and ignorant of women to understand.</p>

<p>Although by now she felt sure that the confusion had arisen
from a mistaken identity, and that despite the evidence her
William had not been involved with that dreadful Cranston woman,
Amy felt rage surge through her at the thought that William might
have kissed that Brand girl.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly her William was the office William, who the other
was she did not care.</p>

<p>That afternoon when she met him, it was with an air of pained
reserve. She told him she did not wish to prejudge him she had
come to give him an opportunity to explain what seemed to her
inexplicable.</p>

<p>And William explained.</p>

<p>He explained with such an air of innocence and candour that
Amy's heart burned with indignation at the utterly unscrupulous
conduct of that Brand creature. Well it was for Tydvil that
Geraldine could not hear William lying away her reputation for
veracity.</p>

<p>He assured Amy that he had not been in the Chief's office on
that fatal morning. That he had never in his life as much as laid
a hand on Miss Brand, much less had he kissed her, as she
alleged. Never had he experienced any inclination to kiss her. He
asserted on his honour that so far as he was concerned there was
not a word of truth in that girl's evidence. As proof he recalled
to her mind that at their meeting at her house that night, he had
not had a black eye.</p>

<p>All this, William's alter ego assured him, did not depart one
hair's breadth from the truth.</p>

<p>His words carried such conviction that Amy found it impossible
to doubt him.</p>

<p>Moreover, the wily William strengthened that conviction by
reminding Amy of the peculiar conduct of Miss Brand in the
witness box. A girl who behaved like that could not be taken
seriously, as the judge had pointed out.</p>

<p>By the time William's explanation was complete, Amy felt
convinced that beside that Brand girl Sapphira was a well of the
purest veracity, and Jezebel was a much overrated sinner. She
voiced her thoughts to William with extensions and annotations,
until William began to feel uneasy at the thought of what might
happen should Amy come into contact with Geraldine on one of her
occasional visits to the office.</p>

<p>He knew that so far as Amy was concerned he had left
Geraldine's reputation a total wreck. He felt certain, too, that
if Amy were to let herself loose on Geraldine, that astute young
woman would, in a second, convict him of being the source of
Amy's information.</p>

<p>Knowing Geraldine, William's alter ego regarded the outlook as
rather perilous. What Miss Brand's reaction to the situation
would be, did not bear contemplation. However, he reflected that
a game that did not involve risks was not worth playing.
Certainly, his spurious identities of Billy and Basil Williams
had made the life of Tydvil Jones' anything but drab and
boring.</p>

<p>The domestic life of Tydvil also became more hectic than usual
during the following week when news reached Amy from sorrowing
secretaries of bereft societies that Mr. Jones had severed his
invaluable connection from them. Life under his own roof became
one long battle, into which Amy flung herself, heart and soul. In
the struggle for liberty and independence Tydvil fought with a
patriot's fervour. The few meals he took at home sounded like
mealtime among the larger carnivora at the Zoo.</p>

<p>His worst experience was when he arrived home late at night to
find Amy in battle array waiting for him. Following his usual
tactics he charged through the enemy's lines, and, closely
pursued, reached his own room. It was only when he attempted to
lock the door he found that the lock had been removed. The job
had been Amy's own handiwork, and had cost her half the afternoon
to complete.</p>

<p>Under her threat to "scream the house down" if he did not let
her in, Tydvil surrendered. It was not a pleasant interview. The
conversation was almost one-sided, and lasted for three hours. It
took Amy every minute of them to describe Tydvil as he appeared
in her eyes. In addition to her views on his desertion of her
causes, his furtive conduct during the past week, and her
suspicions that he was leading a profligate life, she reasserted
her views on that Brand creature, that the girl was not better
than she should be, and that Tydvil knew it.</p>

<p>Finally, some further and more scandalous reflections on
Geraldine spurned Tydvil into reprisals. He fairly blew her out
of the room with a blast of language such as had never before
assaulted Amy's ears. She retired shaken with sobs that on an
earlier day Tydvil would have heard with an abject sense of guilt
and shame. Now they sounded like music in his ears as he
barricaded his door with his bed in case the enemy
counterattacked.</p>

<p>He had one satisfactory sense of superiority in the war. While
he was cherishing his secret of Amy and William, which he was
reserving for a crisis that he knew must come, Amy had nothing on
him. He was still the impeccable Tydvil Jones of the blameless
life&mdash;on the surface, at any rate.</p>

<p>Then, from causes beyond his control swift disaster befell
him.</p>

<p>Since the night that he had defeated the police on the
question of Basil Williams, he had been careful to keep Basil out
of any mischief that might renew their attentions. As Nicholas
had warned him, and as he himself observed, Tydvil Jones was
under quiet but continuous police surveillance. Inspector Kane
was a patient but tenacious man when his own hunches were
concerned. Intuition had linked Basil Williams and Tydvil Jones
in his mind, and he followed that intuition as a ferret follows a
rabbit.</p>

<p>Tydvil had found in Elsie Wilson an entertaining friend. It
was a friendship which to Nicholas's cynical amusement he kept on
a strictly platonic basis. He recognised, however, that few of
Basil Williams's friends accepted it at its face value.</p>

<p>One day, as Basil Williams, he kept a luncheon appointment
with Elsie with intent to spend the afternoon at the Moonee
Valley. When they met in Collins Street, Tydvil noticed that she
was even more lighthearted and entertaining than usual. He was
not to know that Elsie had already absorbed more joy-producing
fluids than discretion warranted. The bottle of wine they shared
at lunch, preceded by a cocktail, completely unleashed Elsie's
not tightly bound inhibitions.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Tydvil did not rightly diagnose the cause of
her spontaneous gaiety until in Collins Street, after lunch, when
the fresh air took immediate effect.</p>

<p>Now, fate decreed that Inspector Kane had paused to speak to a
uniformed man on duty as the two emerged from the restaurant.
Elsie's merry laugh drew his two narrowed grey eyes on Basil
Williams and his partner.</p>

<p>Then, two facts struck Basil with a staggering impact. One
was, that Elsie was far from sober; and the other was that
Inspector Kane and a uniformed man were standing within ten feet
of him.</p>

<p>Basil's thoughts buzzed wildly for a moment and then
crystallised. On the opposite side of the street, and almost in
front of the Centreway, stood a taxi&mdash;and refuge.</p>

<p>Gently but firmly he took the now swaying Elsie's arm and led
her across the street. It was not an easy passage because Elsie's
feet were manifestly unsteady and the traffic was heavy. But he
breathed a sigh of relief when they reached the taxi in safety. A
swift glance warned Tydvil that Kane and the constable had left
the far footpath and were moving across the road with apparent
indifference to his existence.</p>

<p>The taxi-driver regretted he was engaged. Basil quickly
offered him double fare to become disengaged. The man regretfully
and respectfully declined the offer. His obduracy evidently
annoyed the lively Elsie, whose raised voice halted a number of
staggered pedestrians on the footpath. Basil made a desperate but
ineffectual attempt to draw her away through the Centreway. Elsie
was beyond reason, and before he could intervene she struck the
taxi-driver in the face.</p>

<p>What happened next occupied two irreparable seconds. The man,
in trying to dodge the infuriated Elsie, bumped into Basil. The
girl flew at him, and clung like a wild cat. Basil tried to pry
her off her victim and the three crashed in a heap to the
pavement. He was on his feet in a moment and lifted Elsie to her
feet. He had a glimpse of Kane and the constable passing through
the traffic towards them at increased speed.</p>

<p>Chivalry forbade Basil to desert his disastrous partner. With
all speed, half carrying her, he made for the Centre-way. The
only idea in his mind was to escape pursuit. The laughing crowd
let him through, but Kane and his satellite were not more than
thirty feet behind him when he was half way down the short
passage to Flinders Lane.</p>

<p>His mind flew to Nicholas for assistance, and at the same
instant he saw advancing towards him no other than Amy, whose
eyes were fixed with a pious glare on the dishevelled Elsie. At
the same moment Elsie slipped from his grasp to a sitting posture
on the pavement. Behind Basil Williams was one disaster, in front
of him was another. To assume his identity of Tydvil Jones would
be worse than to remain Basil Williams.</p>

<p>Reason fled before instinct. To save Elsie was impossible. It
was a case of sauve qui peut. Turning, he darted up the blind
alley off the passage. It was happily empty, and in its far
corner stood a stack of scaffold poles, behind which the
breathless Basil squeezed himself. But as he did so he recognised
that he was trapped. There were sounds of hurrying feet and
excited voices nearing his refuge.</p>

<p>"We've got the beggar this time," he heard Kane's triumphant
voice.</p>

<p>Strong hands tore the scaffold poles away. To the fugitive was
revealed Inspector Kane and the constable in the immediate
foreground. Slightly behind them was a group of interested
spectators such as gather mysteriously at every unusual event.
Among them stood Amy. Two of the faces bore an expression of
undisguised astonishment. One of these belonged to Inspector
Kane, and the other was Amy's.</p>

<p>The first of the groups to move was Amy. She almost sprang
past Kane and paused with a gasped, "Tydvil! Whatever is the
meaning of this?"</p>

<p>Kane stared from one to the other. "Who is this man?" he
demanded of Amy.</p>

<p>"He is my husband." Amy resented the official voice and manner
of Kane. "He is Mr. Tydvil Jones."</p>

<p>Kane glanced over his shoulder. With the ubiquity of the force
a second uniformed man had joined his colleagues. "Mason! Keep
those people away. You, Burns, take that woman to the watch-
house." He waved his hand towards Elsie, who had passed out where
she lay.</p>

<p>Tydvil's heart went out in sympathy for his unhappy little
playmate who was beyond his aid.</p>

<p>Then Kane turned back to run a cold, inquisitive eye over
Tydvil Jones, whose appearance at the moment was anything but
dignified.</p>

<p>"So!" growled Kane, "you are Mr. Tydvil Jones?" Tydvil wished
very heartily at the moment that he could deny his
identity&mdash;but admitted it.</p>

<p>"Then will you please inform me on what you were doing
concealed behind those poles?" The voice was respectful but
coldly official, and its tone indicated that a full and frank
answer was required.</p>

<p>Although Amy was silent her eyes demanded explanations even
more eloquently than Kane's voice.</p>

<p>Tydvil's trouble at the moment was that an adequate
explanation, impromptu, of the presence of an eminent merchant
and philanthropist behind a pile of poles up an alley off a lane
at one-thirty p.m., was not the easiest thing in the world to
provide.</p>

<p>All he could say as he looked into the searching grey eyes
was, "Urn!" He said "Urn!" several times.</p>

<p>At about the fourth repetition of the word, Inspector Kane
said, not very encouragingly, "You have already said 'Urn,' Mr.
Jones."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Tydvil repeated the word and halted again in his
speech.</p>

<p>Inspector Kane was about to speak again when a diversion came
that made Tydvil's blank face light with joy. Round the corner
from the Centreway came Mr. Nicholas Senior, serene, dignified
and unhurried.</p>

<p>The expression in Tydvil's face made Kane turn to survey the
newcomer. Nicholas, however, completely disregarded Kane's
presence. He raised his hat to Amy, who also hailed his arrival
with pleasure, though it was a pleasure tinged with
embarrassment.</p>

<p>Nicholas placed his hand on Tydvil's shoulder. "Did you get
them?" he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Who are you, sir?" demanded Kane irritably.</p>

<p>"You may have heard of Mr. Nicholas Senior," Tydvil explained,
and to Nicholas, "This gentleman is a police officer."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Nicholas smiled. "How very fortunate." Then to Tydvil,
"Did you really get them!"</p>

<p>Bewildered, but trusting Nicholas, Tydvil shook his head. "I'm
afraid not."</p>

<p>"Will you be good enough to explain to me what this is all
about?" Kane's patience was evaporating fast.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jones and I," he said serenely,&mdash;"You know he is the
Vice-President of the Anti-Gambling League&mdash;having been
suspicious that two men are using this alleyway to conduct
starting price gambling..."</p>

<p>"What!" snapped Kane.</p>

<p>"And," Nicholas went on, unheeding the hostility of the voice,
"we decided that one of us should watch each day to try to
procure evidence of the offence."</p>

<p>Kane looked from one to the other and the expression in his
face was not flattering to either Nicholas, Tydvil, or the
explanation. What he may have intended to say was cut short by
Amy, who broke in with, "But, Tydvil, you have resigned from the
Anti-Gambling League!"</p>

<p>Under his breath Tydvil said something that was not quite
nice.</p>

<p>Aloud, Kane gave vent to an expressive "Oh!" Then he turned
on. Tydvil, "If you are not a member of the League, why are you
hunting gamblers?"</p>

<p>"I am still interested in the suppression of the vice,"
replied Tydvil with dignity.</p>

<p>"You must be," was Kane's dry comment. "So perhaps you can
tell me what became of the man who ran into this alley just
before I arrived?"</p>

<p>"A man!" Tydvil's voice sounded as though a man were as rare a
phenomenon in the city as an angel.</p>

<p>"Yes!" went on Kane. "A man named Basil Williams. He came in
here, and he certainly did not go out."</p>

<p>"I certainly did not see a man come in here," Tydvil
asserted.</p>

<p>"Yet you were watching for gamblers." Kane's tone was
unpleasant.</p>

<p>"You must be mistaken." Tydvil had to keep his ground.</p>

<p>"He was not mistaken, Tydvil, dear," put in Amy. "I distinctly
saw a man who was with that horrid woman, leave her and run in
here." Amy was beginning to enjoy herself.</p>

<p>Kane drew himself up with a decisive motion. "Mr. Jones, there
are circumstances surrounding this incident that require further
information from you. I must ask you to accompany me to Russell
Street."</p>

<p>"I most positively decline to go to Russell Street." Tydvil
stood on his dignity. "If you wish to continue this absurd
inquisition, my office is close by. We can continue our
conversation there."</p>

<p>"Very good!" Kane nodded stiffly. "You will come with me,
please."</p>

<p>He turned away, but Amy was too full of curiosity to be
denied, as the other two fell in beside him.</p>

<p>"Tydvil, I insist on being present at this interview," she
said.</p>

<p>Kane looked at her, undecided. Tydvil, however, was in no
humour for Amy. "There is not the slightest necessity," he
snapped.</p>

<p>"But I insist." Amy was afraid she might miss something.</p>

<p>"My dear Mrs. Jones," Nicholas interfered gently but firmly,
"I shall stay with Mr. Jones, and I really think you would be
wiser not to accompany us." He accompanied the words with an
understanding smile that conquered Amy.</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Senior," she said graciously, "So long as you
are with Mr. Jones I feel sure I have no cause for anxiety."</p>

<p>"I am certain of that." He raised his hat. "I promise I will
look after him."</p>

<p>The three men made their way through the curious crowd that
still remained watching from the entrance. Kane marched stiffly
ahead, without even glancing back to see if he were followed.</p>

<p>As they walked, Tydvil murmured his thanks to Nicholas who
warned him there were still hurdles ahead.</p>

<p>Geraldine was at her desk as three figures advanced down the
warehouse between stacks of sheeting and piled Manchester goods.
Her heart danced when she recognised the third member of the
party as Inspector Kane. She did not even glance up as the three
men passed her desk and entered Tydvil's private office. Tydvil
pushed the door behind him but it had not quite closed. With
shameless curiosity Geraldine walked to a filing cabinet close to
the door, her ears alert.</p>

<p>Tydvil took his accustomed seat at the table. Nicholas waved
Kane to the armchair, and seated himself on the corner of the
table.</p>

<p>"Now!" Tydvil, on his native heath, spoke decisively. "Perhaps
you will let me know what this is all about."</p>

<p>Unabashed at his tone, Kane replied, "That is just what I am
expecting from you, Mr. Jones."</p>

<p>"I am quite at sea." Tydvil's voice was all candour. "Perhaps
if you asked some questions..." He waved his hands largely.</p>

<p>"That is just what I intend to do," responded Kane,
disregarding the friendliness of Tydvil's invitation.</p>

<p>"Do you still assert, Mr. Jones, that though you were watching
for some bookmaker, you did not see a man enter that alley?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"I assure you, Inspector, that I did not," Tydvil replied.
"You were not asleep, by any chance" There was more than a hint
of sarcasm in the voice.</p>

<p>"You are jesting, Inspector." Tydvil smiled engagingly.</p>

<p>"Believe me, I am not, and you would be well advised to
recognise that," was the frosty retort. "A man did enter that
alley, and I'm afraid I cannot accept your assurance that you did
not see him."</p>

<p>"How very peculiar!" Mr. Senior observed.</p>

<p>"Very!" said Kane dryly, without taking his eyes off
Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Then I have nothing to add," said Tydvil shortly.</p>

<p>"Tell me this, Mr. Jones," asked Kane abruptly. "Do you know
the man Basil Williams, or have you had any dealing with
him?"</p>

<p>"I have never yet met the man, nor spoken to him," replied
Tydvil flatly.</p>

<p>"You will find it far wiser to be frank with me," insisted
Kane.</p>

<p>"Believe me, I am totally at a loss to understand how you can
associate me with this man Williams in any way," Tydvil
affirmed.</p>

<p>"Candidly, Mr. Jones, I don't believe you," came back the
uncompromising Kane.</p>

<p>"Then, perhaps you can supply me with some reasons for your
doubt. And let me tell you, Inspector Kane, I object strongly to
your manner. I find it offensive." Tydvil tried taking the high
ground.</p>

<p>Inspector Kane was not impressed. Others had tried that on him
before. "Mr. Jones!" his voice was becoming more official. "You
will be good enough to explain why, on the night of the riot in
town three months ago, your hat was in Williams's possession?
Why, on the night Mr. Muskat was assaulted, you were found alone
in the lane into which Williams escaped? Why, later, when
Williams was traced into De Graves Street, he had vanished and
you were there alone? Why, today, when I ran Williams into that
alley he had again vanished, but you were there?"</p>

<p>"Do you dare to say that I am Williams?" Tydvil demanded with
some show of anger.</p>

<p>"I am asserting nothing, sir!" Kane said shortly. "I am asking
for an explanation."</p>

<p>"Don't you think that is rather difficult?" Tydvil sneered a
little.</p>

<p>"I am sure it is. One coincidence of the kind might be
explained; but four coincidences, Mr. Jones, require a great deal
of explanation." Kane's voice had become silky, but all the more
menacing.</p>

<p>"Then," Tydvil exclaimed, "I can't help you! I know nothing of
Basil Williams, and I am not interested in him."</p>

<p>He was still speaking when a knock at the door heralded the
advent of Geraldine. She carried an open cheque book in her
hand.</p>

<p>Jones glanced up, and said, "Not now, Miss Brand, I am
engaged."</p>

<p>Geraldine stood her ground. "I am sorry, Mr. Jones, but before
you went to lunch you told me to bring this cheque for five
hundred pounds for Mr. Basil Williams for signature the moment
you returned."</p>

<p>Kane sprang to his feet and snatched the book from her hands.
"So!" he ejaculated triumphantly, "He told you that did he?"
turning to Geraldine.</p>

<p>The expression of consternation on Tydvil's face was perfectly
natural. That on Geraldine's face was perfectly acted. Mr.
Nicholas Senior's eyes were dancing with suppressed mirth.</p>

<p>"I..." Geraldine stammered, looking at Tydvil for
guidance.</p>

<p>"That will do! Go!" ordered Kane, bustling her to the door,
which he closed abruptly after her.</p>

<p>Outside, Geraldine stood with a Mona Lisa smile on her lips,
and with her head inclined intently to the door.</p>

<p>"Now!" Kane almost barked. "You will be good enough, sir, to
tell me all you know of this man you don't know, but for whom you
sign cheques for five hundred pounds?" He slapped the book as he
spoke.</p>

<p>That was the second poser Kane had put to Tydvil that day, and
Tydvil felt, as he sat at his table with his face in his hands,
that it was one too many.</p>

<p>Kane resumed his seat and glared at the bent head. "I am
waiting! You must recognise, Mr. Jones, that your position is
serious."</p>

<p>Nicholas sat watching Tydvil for a sign that did not come.</p>

<p>Then Tydvil sat erect and turned to Kane. "You have placed me
in a position which I hoped to avoid," he said wearily. "I have
to admit now that Basil Williams has been blackmailing me."</p>

<p>At that dashing falsehood, look of admiration flashed into
Nicholas's face.</p>

<p>Thirty years' experience of its worst aspect had left little
faith in humanity in Inspector Kane. He had seen many apparently
impeccable reputations smash when their owners were cornered.
Still, the admission of Tydvil Jones surprised even his hardened
mind but he never thought to doubt the statement.</p>

<p>There was even a little pity in his eyes as he regarded
Tydvil. "So!" he thought, "the little pipsqueak wowser had run
off the rails."</p>

<p>What he said was, and he said it with decision, "You would
have saved yourself a lot of trouble&mdash;and perhaps
money&mdash;if you had come to us in the first place."</p>

<p>"Impossible," murmured Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Mr. Jones," continued Kane. "I am not your judge. I am not
going to ask why that ruffian is blackmailing you. But, believe
me, there are fools, and there are fools, and there are damn
Fools. But the biggest damn fool of all is the man who pays a
blackmailer."</p>

<p>Tydvil sat with bend head and made no response. Kane's voice
grew a little kinder. "Come, Mr. Jones, help us. Tell me where
the fellow lives."</p>

<p>Tydvil shook a despairing head. "I have no idea."</p>

<p>"I don't want to press you. But is there a woman in the
case?"</p>

<p>Tydvil, thinking of Amy, nodded an affirmative. "More than
one?" suggested Kane, hopefully.</p>

<p>"Hell's bells!" grunted Tydvil. "Isn't one enough?"</p>

<p>Kane stood up. "One thing I would like you to do, Mr. Jones,
is to consult your solicitor on the meaning of condonation, and
on how it is regarded by the law."</p>

<p>"Oh! I know that!" Tydvil answered sullenly.</p>

<p>"Then make me a promise," Kane urged. "Don't pay this money
and if he comes back at you, let us know, and we will deal with
him as he deserves. It's a public duty as well as a legal
obligation."</p>

<p>Tydvil remained silent and thoughtful.</p>

<p>"I promise you, Mr. Jones, we will protect your name and
prevent it from being published." Kane was very persuasive.</p>

<p>Tydvil sat up as one making a great decision. "Very well,
Inspector," he said, "I give you my word of honour I will not pay
over this cheque. And I promise if Williams threatens me again I
will communicate with you at once."</p>

<p>"Good man! Good man!" exclaimed Kane heartily, "and I know I
can rely on you."</p>

<p>"You can," said Tydvil with conviction.</p>

<p>"Well, I will not trespass on your time any longer." He turned
to the door and paused. "Mr. Senior, I think that you could help
Mr. Jones in this matter."</p>

<p>"I assure you I will!" responded Nicholas heartily.</p>

<p>Kane nodded and went about his business. As he passed down the
warehouse, Geraldine's eyes followed the stiff back speculatively
until three hornet-like buzzes on her table summoned her to
Tydvil's room. She made a face at the buzzer, patted her hair,
and entered the presence with head erect and defiance in her
eyes.</p>

<p>Tydvil was leaning back in his chair as she stood before him.
For a long moment he stared at her in silence. Then: "So you
profess to be my friend! My friend! You double-dyed
traitress!"</p>

<p>"When I claimed to be your friend, I did not know what an
unspeakable traitor you were." She spoke coldly. "You! Call me a
traitress!"</p>

<p>"Would you consider me inquisitive if I asked why you brought
that cheque in here?" he asked bitterly.</p>

<p>"Not at all," she replied airily. "I did it in the hope that
it would land you in an everlasting mess with the police."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Geraldine, for your kind thought and for your
still kinder intentions."</p>

<p>"I trust I succeeded in my plan?" asked the icy damsel.</p>

<p>"Alas! Geraldine, you failed," he jeered at her. "My native
intelligence saved me. But that does not lessen the debt of
gratitude I owe you."</p>

<p>"What a pity," she sighed. "I hoped to see you go out with
handcuffs on."</p>

<p>"Might I venture to ask why you cherish these delightful
sentiments towards me?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"It's a pleasure to enlighten you&mdash;you unscrupulous
ruffian."</p>

<p>"Please, Geraldine!" Tydvil said gently. "I didn't ask you for
flattery. Just a little information on so trifling a matter."</p>

<p>"My reason for trying to have you arrested arises from a visit
I had from a certain high moral authority just before you came
in," she retorted with venom in her voice.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Tydvil straightened up. "So," he thought, "that
accounted for Amy's presence in the lane."</p>

<p>"I see you understand," she went on.</p>

<p>"My dear Geraldine! There must be some mistake, surely."</p>

<p>"Mistake indeed!" She tossed her head. "Who was it assured
Mrs. Jones that I was a perjurer? Where did she get the notion
that I am a designing unprincipled creature who lures men into
disgrace? Who told her that Billy's black eye was a pure
fabrication? Who led her to believe that I am a bright pink, if
not a scarlet, woman? Who prompted...?"</p>

<p>"But, Geraldine!" Tydvil broke in. "Surely you don't
think..."</p>

<p>"Think!" she interrupted. "No! I know! Tyddie, you've even
less moral scruple than your noble friend." She glared at
Nicholas. "I know what happened as though I'd been there. As
Billy, you had to save yourself, and you&mdash;you
horror!&mdash;You sacrificed me to do it."</p>

<p>Tydvil's head was bowed to the blast.</p>

<p>"Look me in the eye and deny it! You can't, and you know you
can't."</p>

<p>Tydvil turned to Nicholas, who shrugged his shoulders and
laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh! You're a lovely pair!"</p>

<p>Tydvil looked up guiltily at the figure of Nemesis that
towered over him. "Was it a very tough ordeal, Geraldine?" he
asked sympathetically.</p>

<p>"You admit it?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"I was in a terribly tough corner, Geraldine," he pleaded.</p>

<p>She looked from one to the other. Even Nicholas had the grace
to look ashamed. They looked so like a pair of guilty schoolboys
that she laughed, and relented.</p>

<p>"Now you listen to me&mdash;both of you! If I have any more
trouble from you two I'll make you both sorry for it if it takes
the rest of my life to do it."</p>

<p>"I'm really sorry, Geraldine," Tydvil urged penitently,</p>

<p>"And so you should be," she retorted. "And I warn you, if that
high moral authority favours me with any more of her personal
views on my character there is going to be a scandal in C. B.
&amp; D. I'll live up to the reputation you have given me, my
friend. She can consider herself lucky that she is not a total
wreck now."</p>

<p>"But surely, Geraldine, you wouldn't use violence?" Tydvil's
voice sounded more hopeful than shocked.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't I?" the fiery girl retorted. "She said things to me
that no woman can say to another. Any woman between a duchess and
charwoman would have been justified in peeling her for half what
she said to me."</p>

<p>"Geraldine! Geraldine!" Tydvil admonished, laughing.</p>

<p>"You can put it down to my self-restraint and self-respect
that she didn't get out of the office in her blushes; and I won't
answer for myself another time." Voice, attitude, and eyes
testified to Amy's narrow escape from a truly sensational
experience.</p>

<p>"And so," said Tydvil without trying to hide his amusement,
"you took it out of me."</p>

<p>"I did my best," she agreed.</p>

<p>"You put me in an awful hole, you demon."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," she replied with simple candour.</p>

<p>"What am I to do with her?" Tydvil turned to appreciative
Nicholas.</p>

<p>"In your place," advised Nicholas, "my policy would be fervent
conciliation."</p>

<p>Tydvil laughed, "Make it pax, Geraldine. You put a nasty one
over me, so that ought to make us square."</p>

<p>Her wrath had died down, and with a chuckle she said, "Pax it
is&mdash;but it should be a lesson to you I'm not to be trifled
with."</p>

<p>"Bless you, my children," from Nicholas.</p>

<p>Geraldine swung round on him. "As for you, I don't appreciate
your blessing. I don't know what you are or who you are, but even
if you're what I believe you to be, I'm not afraid of you, and
I'm not done with you yet!" Her eyes turned to the date block on
Tydvil's table. "No, not yet!"</p>

<p>Nicholas stood up. "I have too profound an appreciation of
your sex, and of you, to disregard the warning."</p>

<p>"And I know too much of your sex, and of you, to express much
appreciation of either," she said defiantly.</p>

<p>"Let me try to win a little by offering a sincere apology, for
the trick I played on you."</p>

<p>"Didn't someone say, 'Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes'?"
Nicholas's smile was friendly. "I'm no Greek, Geraldine, and I
really mean I am sorry."</p>

<p>She looked at him speculatively. "I believe you mean it, and I
accept, but," she smiled, "don't ask me to trust you. It is still
war."</p>

<p>"Fair exchange," he laughed, "you accept my apology and I
accept your challenge."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," she said, "Tydvil says you are a
sportsman."</p>

<p>He nodded. "I try to be one."</p>

<p>"Then, if it's war, play fair," she challenged.</p>

<p>"You mean?" He was frankly interested.</p>

<p>"Fair play and no miracles," she demanded.</p>

<p>Nicholas laughed heartily. "I might have expected something
like that."</p>

<p>"I only want an equality of weapons," she persisted.</p>

<p>"You overestimate my strength," Nicholas shook his head. "You
may not recognise it, but you are better armed than I. Even I
can't afford to give anything away in fighting Geraldine
Brand."</p>

<p>"Very well!" she said decisively, "then it's no quarter."</p>

<p>"And the prize?" he glanced towards Tydvil.</p>

<p>Geraldine nodded. "Since he won't help himself." Then to
Tydvil, "You're an unscrupulous creature, and don't think I'm
doing it on your account, I'm only doing it to teach Mr. Senior a
lesson.'</p>

<p>"Oh! Don't mind me, Geraldine," laughed Tydvil. "I seem to
have no say in the arrangement."</p>

<p>"None whatever!" she agreed. "You're a pawn, a bone of
contention&mdash;in fact, you don't count."</p>

<p>"You must agree, Tydvil, that she is quite candid with us
both," said Nicholas.</p>

<p>"You see," she turned to Nicholas, "if I can cancel that Bill,
I'll settle my account with you, and Tydvil will get all he
deserves by living with Mrs. Jones&mdash;so he doesn't escape
much."</p>

<p>"What a woman!" There was sincere admiration in Nicholas's
voice.</p>

<p>"Now we understand one another, anyway," she said, moving
towards the door. "I have work to do."</p>

<p>As she closed the door behind her the two men looked from it
to one another.</p>

<p>Said Tydvil, "Cheerful child! Isn't she?"</p>

<p>Nicholas grinned. "It may, interest you to know, that despite
that tirade against you, she is as loyal to you as steel, and she
likes you immensely."</p>

<p>"Somehow, I think you're right," smiled Tydvil.</p>

<p>"And," Nicholas added, "I think Mrs. Jones would be very well
advised to keep clear of her."</p>

<p>Tydvil nodded. "I'll do what I can, but that is not much. I
wonder," he said thoughtfully, "just what Geraldine is up
to."</p>

<p>"In a long, long experience," Nicholas replied, "one of the
very few things I have learned about women is that it is
unprofitable to predict what they will do."</p>

<p>"But can she do anything?" Tydvil asked.</p>

<p>"I doubt it," Nicholas answered, "but..." He paused, sunk in
thought. "Perhaps their Creator does understand women, but they
have given me so much trouble, and deceived me so often that I
sometimes think they are the greatest of my punishments."</p>

<p>"A punishment in disguise," suggested Tydvil. "Perhaps,"
Nicholas reflected. "But I have never married."</p>

<p>"Misogamist!" laughed Tydvil.</p>

<p>"No, just scared," replied Nicholas.</p>

<p>"Scared! You!" Tydvil was astonished.</p>

<p>"Aye, Tydvil, scared. How does it go&mdash;'Fools rush in
where angels fear to tread'?"</p>

<p>"Angels?"</p>

<p>"Same thing," said Mr. Senior.</p>

<p>On the following morning Tydvil handed Geraldine a cheque on
his private account with instructions to cash it herself and to
draw the money in £100 notes. Even the well-trained Geraldine
could scarce forbear to raise her eye-brows when she read the
amount. Tydvil, watching her face, saw the curiosity that she
could not hide.</p>

<p>"That, my dear Geraldine, is conscience money, since you are
so curious about it," he said.</p>

<p>"You must have a blotchy conscience," replied Miss Brand,
regarding the figures with awe.</p>

<p>"Well, not so blotchy as your censorious mind imagines," he
grinned.</p>

<p>"Well," she returned, "all I can say is that its tenderness
does you credit, if it isn't blotchy."</p>

<p>"It's a debt I owe&mdash;with interest added&mdash;to my very
dull youth." Tydvil smiled.</p>

<p>When Geraldine returned with the notes Tydvil dismissed her,
and spent some time in making them into a neat parcel.</p>

<p>That night Miss Elsie Wilson received a small package
addressed to her at the Casino Club. In it was a brief message
from Basil Williams regretting that he had been called from
Melbourne on urgent affairs and was unable to say goodbye. He
begged she would accept the enclosure with his best wishes for
her future.</p>

<p>Thereafter the Casino Club knew her no more. Within a
fortnight Elsie had established a business which prospered under
her own shrewd management. But she never knew why Craddock, Burns
and Despard were always so kind and considerate to her in her
dealings with them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p>As the days passed, Geraldine began to detest the sight of the
calendar on her office table. She hated to date her letters. Both
clamoured that October was closing and November was at hand. When
she had defied Nicholas, it was in the hope that inspiration
would come to her. During the days that followed, she formed and
rejected a score of plans. Billy, she found, was concerned, but
hopeless. Tydvil was unconcerned and indifferent. What a nuisance
men were!</p>

<p>Although she became more and more worried as time went on,
Tydvil's disregard for its passage exasperated her. Every morning
seemed to make him younger and more irresponsible. The head of C.
B. &amp; D. behaved like twenty-five years old, instead of the
thirty-five he really was. The change was all the more marked
because the old Tydvil was nearer fifty in outlook and
deportment.</p>

<p>It was not that he neglected his work. He entered into it with
even, a greater zest than before. Indeed, he actually worked
harder in the office, so as to find time for play. And play he
did, with an even greater zest than he worked. But the dull,
priggish and stolid Tydvil had vanished. Their morning session
for the mail and dictation had become a lively, and to both, and
enjoyable hour. He teased Geraldine with the mischief of a
schoolboy. He interspersed the official letters with sheer
nonsense.</p>

<p>Almost every afternoon by four o'clock, Nicholas would stroll
into the office, and perhaps for ten minutes Geraldine's ears
would catch sounds of mirth. Then they would depart together.</p>

<p>"Guess where I was last night," he said one morning. "I'd hate
to." Geraldine tossed her head.</p>

<p>"Paris!" he replied. "You've no idea what Paris can be with
Nicholas for a guide."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's just as well I have no idea," sniffed Miss
Brand.</p>

<p>"Wowser!" His eyes danced.</p>

<p>"I suppose Melbourne is too small for our Mr. Jones now?" she
said.</p>

<p>"No, my dear Geraldine, too hot. Our mutual friend, Inspector
Kane, seems to think that there is no one in the city but
me."</p>

<p>"Well, there's one thing, I can't retort and call you a wowser
now."</p>

<p>"There's a high moral authority who is in complete agreement
with you on one point at any rate."</p>

<p>"And she doesn't know half," added Geraldine.</p>

<p>Tydvil screwed up his eyes. "Not one-sixteenth, I'm happy to
say."</p>

<p>"Well," said Geraldine, "you'd better make the most of your
little playmate, Nicholas. You've only four days to go now."</p>

<p>"With his help, my dear girl, you'd be surprised to know what
can be done with four days." Tydvil's voice was full of
appreciation.</p>

<p>"Paris again tonight then, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"You bet! I won twenty-five thousand francs at Long-champs,
and I don't want to waste one franc of it."</p>

<p>"And to think I'm worrying about you and that wretched Bill,"
she said with deep feeling.</p>

<p>"Forget it, Geraldine. I have." He smiled.</p>

<p>"You men! What with you and Billy I'm perfectly dizzy."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me he's gone off the rails." Tydvil looked at her
in surprise.</p>

<p>"I was idiot enough to warn him not to back that wretched
horse you told me about."</p>

<p>Tydvil chuckled. "Surely you knew better than that."</p>

<p>"I've learned now. But he has wasted twenty pounds on it," she
said indignantly.</p>

<p>"Wait until next Tuesday afternoon before you say 'wasted',"
he suggested.</p>

<p>"That is one reason why I am going out to Flemington with him
on Cup Day," she explained.</p>

<p>"And another?" He raised his brows.</p>

<p>"A new frock&mdash;it's a dream."</p>

<p>"Not such a wowser after all." He laughed. "Listen! This is an
order. You and Billy lunch with me out at the course on
Tuesday."</p>

<p>Geraldine gurgled. "All right, between you and your fine
friend my reputation is damaged already. I might as well get some
fun out of it."</p>

<p>On the Saturday morning Geraldine, having sorted the mail, was
called upstairs before Tydvil arrived at the office. On her way
down again she encountered a department manager coming up. He
looked as though he had been seeing things.</p>

<p>"Good gracious! Mr. Gale, what's happened?" she enquired.</p>

<p>He goggled at her and gasped. "Holy Wars! Miss Brand, have you
seen the Chief?"</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"G-g-go and look at him..." He passed on, suffering under some
powerful emotion.</p>

<p>Geraldine's feet scarcely touched the floor as she hastened to
the Chief's office.</p>

<p>She stood petrified as she entered. The head of C. B. &amp; D.
was inspecting himself before his mirror with not a little
satisfaction in his reflected expression.</p>

<p>As he heard her he turned. "Do you like it?" He was grinning
widely.</p>

<p>Mr. Tydvil Jones was wearing a new suit, oyster grey in
colour, and of rakish cut. On his feet were tan shoes. The grey
Alpine hat was set at a defiant angle. Across his chest was the
strap of the race glasses that rested in their case against his
hip.</p>

<p>Still Geraldine stared. Nothing less like the once Tydvil
Jones was it possible to imagine. Suddenly she found her voice
and gasped, "Lovely!" Then she leaned against the wall and
laughed.</p>

<p>"Really, Geraldine!" he protested.</p>

<p>"It's perfect&mdash;perfect! But..." She struggled with her
mirth. "But what did the High Moral Authority say?"</p>

<p>Tydvil joined in her laughter. "I don't know all of it yet.
She hadn't half finished when I left home."</p>

<p>"Do you know," she said as she recovered herself, "that you
have almost given Mr. Gale apoplexy?"</p>

<p>"He certainly did look surprised when I passed him coming in,"
Tydvil said. "Did he say anything to you?"</p>

<p>"Just 'Holy Wars!'" gurgled Geraldine.</p>

<p>"Hump!" Tydvil commented. "And that's just what it is going to
be at home."</p>

<p>It might have been Holy Wars at home, but on the Monday
morning, it was an unchastened and merry Tydvil who whistled him
way down the warehouse.</p>

<p>In answer to Geraldine's enquiry he told her he had had a
gorgeous day, though it had cost him twenty pounds&mdash;"quid"
he called it; a word that never before had passed his lips.</p>

<p>That morning he dictated a notice to the entire staff of the
warehouse. It announced general increases in salaries of from ten
per cent. to as much as twenty per cent. among its lower paid
members. With twinkling eyes he said to Geraldine as she took it
down in shorthand. "My charity is beginning at home in
future&mdash; and besides, I'm making more out of this particular
form of banditry than I need."</p>

<p>By evening when the news spread round the great building,
there were few who were not whistling as merrily as Tydvil had
been in the morning&mdash;and the morrow was Cup Day and a
holiday, There was not a more contented population in the city
than that of C. B. &amp; D.</p>

<p>On that November third, that dawned next day, there were many
light-hearted people in the good city of Melbourne. But of them
all were none so carefree as Geraldine Brand and William Brewer.
Geraldine had shut the thought of the next day out of her mind.
Billy's gasp of delight as his eyes fell in the picture she made
in her new frock, would have gratified any girl. Flemington was
at its best, the weather was at its best, and the thousands that
thronged the wide, green grounds rose to the occasion.</p>

<p>Neither Geraldine nor Billy had dreamed what a perfect host
Tyddie could be. He treated Billy as a friend and an equal and
chaffed the two happily. At lunch Geraldine glanced round. Tydvil
read her meaning, and laughed. "No, Geraldine," he said,
"Nicholas declined to join us. He said he might be a discordant
factor, and that the spoons might not be long enough for your
liking."</p>

<p>Alas! For evil communications that corrupt good morals. At
lunch Geraldine sipped suspiciously at first, at the glass of
vintage wine that was poured out for her. The second sip was less
suspicious. After that there was no suspicion whatever. When they
arrived in the open air again Geraldine Brand entrusted to
William Brewer one pound to put on a horse of her own choosing,
despite the advice of Tydvil and Billy. When, later on she
collected eight pounds, there was no holding her.</p>

<p>The race for Thundercloud's Cup still remains a mystery in
turf history. The horse's owner admitted ruefully, afterwards,
that only certain representations of certain people who had drawn
Thundercloud in a certain consultation induced him to leave the
horse in the race. Despite Tydvil's investment the bookmakers
were still offering two hundred to one against, before the race.
But even the most hardened optimists resisted that bait&mdash;to
their subsequent sorrow. And, to her disgust, Geraldine was among
them.</p>

<p>When the three, who had secured an excellent post on the
terrace, saw the drove of flying horses and colours pass the
stand for the first time, Thundercloud was a comfortable last,
and looked like staying there forever. By the time the horses had
reached the far side of the course Tydvil returned his glasses to
their case. Thundercloud was still holding his position at the
tail of the procession. Billy, however, was made of sterner
optimistic material. His comments as the field swept nearer the
straight were anything but complimentary to Thundercloud.</p>

<p>Then, as the head of the field was turning into the straight,
something happened. Some one hundred and fifty thousand voices
yelling "Lapwing" or "Diorite" or "Hector" were suddenly smitten
into silence. Something in gold, white and chocolate came raging
out from the back of the ruck. It swept round the turn neck and
neck with Lapwing and Hector, then passed them, flashing down the
straight lengths ahead of the thundering mob behind. To the
staring crowd it looked more like an accelerated motion picture
of a horse than a living animal. The crowd moaned in unison as it
flashed passed the post with a dozen lengths to spare. It is
difficult even now to say whether horse, jockey, owner, stewards
or the crowd were the most astounded. Thundercloud came in, for
the only time in Cup history, in a dead silence&mdash;the crowd
had lost its voice&mdash;temporarily. There was plenty said and
yelled later on. All the explanation that Brandish, the amazed
jockey, could give was, that Thundercloud seemed to go mad just
before he reached the straight. He gave a bound that nearly
unseated his rider and took complete charge of his movements,
which were as swift as they were incomprehensible.</p>

<p>The most searching veterinary examination failed to detect
dope. The owner's evident astonishment rang true. The stewards
saw no reason to interfere with the judge's decision. But that
all came afterwards. Something, however, happened on the terrace
as Thundercloud passed the post that amused the immediate
spectators. After having ardently embraced one of her companions,
a daughter of the gods in green, who was tall and most divinely
fair, put her arms about the neck of her other companion and
kissed him warmly on both cheeks. Those who witnessed the
incident would have been far more interested had they known that
the recipient of the second demonstration was no other than
Tydvil Jones.</p>

<p>"Aren't you ashamed of yourself, Geraldine?" protested the
pleased but embarrassed Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Billy," Tydvil turned to Brewer, "can you not control this
turbulent wench?"</p>

<p>"Not I," laughed Billy, "she's a shameless baggage."</p>

<p>"Wowsers!" taunted Geraldine.</p>

<p>"Don't you dare call me that," Tydvil stormed at her.</p>

<p>"Would you prefer 'Darling'?" Her voice was a caress.</p>

<p>"Billy! Stop her, she's worse than Thundercloud," cried
Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Don't you try to bully me," she said recklessly, "or I'll
kiss you both again."</p>

<p>Just at that moment Geraldine saw Nicholas Senior making
towards them through the now disintegrating crowd. In her humour
at this juncture Geraldine forgot her animosity and greeted him
cheerfully as he came up to them.</p>

<p>"Oh Mr. Senior," she said, her face flushed with excitement,
"did you see the race? Wasn't Thundercloud wonderful?"</p>

<p>"He was," smiled Mr. Senior. "I ought to know, because I was
riding him."</p>

<p>"Congratulations!" laughed Geraldine.</p>

<p>"After all," she told Billy that night as they talked over the
events of the day, "I couldn't be rude to anyone who had won six
thousand pounds for us? Could I?'</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid," replied Billy piously, "that I should try to
gauge what you could or could not do. You're beyond me. But for
the love o' Mike, dearest, don't alter."</p>

<p>Next morning Geraldine arrived at the office with all her
misgivings intact. It seemed somehow strange that the day was no
different from other days. Yet everything in the office was
exactly the same as usual. To her there should have been some
gloom&mdash;some recognition of Tydvil's peril. But that terrible
Bill was due at midday, and none but she and Billy knew it.</p>

<p>Not the knowledge that their home was assured, relieved her
fears for Tydvil. She confided her feelings to Billy, who shared
them, but who could offer no suggestions.</p>

<p>Tydvil arrived on time and seemed less concerned than ever. He
teased her about her behaviour of the day before and laughed at
her as she rose to the bait. Somehow she sensed that he did not
wish her to refer to the date or the Bill that was so nearly
clue. As she left the room he said, "Oh! Geraldine. I'm expecting
Mr. Senior a little after eleven. See we are not disturbed."</p>

<p>She was about to make a last plea, but his lifted hand checked
her, and she went to her work with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>All the morning the everyday life of the warehouse buzzed on.
She typed her letters, she answered phone calls and interviewed
callers and the staff almost mechanically Some how she felt she
wanted support, and chased Billy through the warehouse on the
house phones, and begged him to come to her at about eleven-
thirty. Understanding, Billy agreed. He, too, shared her anxiety,
but he felt that nothing either she or he could do would be of
any avail.</p>

<p>It was about a quarter after eleven that a clear, vibrant
voice beside her made her aware of Nicholas's presence.</p>

<p>There was mischief, but friendly mischief in his eyes. "Still
war?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To the last second," she affirmed.</p>

<p>"Oh! You fighting red-heads!" he laughed.</p>

<p>"There are still forty-five minutes," she said.</p>

<p>"Forty-five years would be no use to you."</p>

<p>"If I had them, I would try all the time."</p>

<p>"And fail!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Jones is expecting you," she said shortly, turning
away.</p>

<p>"Goodbye, Geraldine!" he laughed.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness!" she retorted to his back, as he walked
towards the door.</p>

<p>Nicholas strolled into Tydvil's room and dropped into the
armchair. For a while neither spoke. Nicholas lighted a cigarette
and Tydvil took a cigar from a box that had become part of his
table furniture.</p>

<p>"You know, Tydvil," said Nicholas presently, "I am sorry to be
going. Ours has been a pleasant friendship."</p>

<p>Tydvil nodded. "I'll miss you, Nicholas, but I can find my own
way now."</p>

<p>"You certainly have developed in three months, my friend."</p>

<p>Tydvil glanced at the clock. "What time do you leave?"</p>

<p>"Twelve exactly. There is an escort coming for me."</p>

<p>"You have finished your investigations?" asked Tydvil.
Nicholas shrugged his shoulders. "Yes, my friend. All I have
found out that is new, is that sin has become mechanised, and has
not improved very much in the process."</p>

<p>"Our clerics and economists declare the world was never in a
worse state."</p>

<p>"Umph!" Nicholas said. "To my knowledge the clerics have been
saying that for two thousand years&mdash;as for the economists,
if they're agreed on that, it is the only subject on which I have
ever known as many as two of the breed': in agreement."</p>

<p>"So it's not so bad as they, say?" asked Tydvil.</p>

<p>"No, don't think that," Nicholas interposed quickly, "it is
infinitely worse than I imagined."</p>

<p>"That's a bad lookout for us, Nicholas." There was concern in
Tydvil's voice. "Anything that causes you to become pessimistic
does not promise much for us."</p>

<p>For a moment an expression flashed into the eyes of Nicholas
that sent an icy chill from the tips of Tydvil's toes to the
roots of his hair. When he spoke, there was a ring of fury in his
voice&mdash;fury and despair.</p>

<p>"I had hoped," he said tensely, "that you poor human fools had
learned your lesson, but that accursed Judas Iscariot has fooled
both you and me."</p>

<p>"Communism?" Tydvil asked.</p>

<p>Nicholas nodded. "Yes, Communism," replied Nicholas. "I might
have known when he betrayed his first Master, he would betray me
also."</p>

<p>"But," interrupted Tydvil, "Will not fascism act as an
antidote for the poison?"</p>

<p>Nicholas turned pitying eyes on Tydvil. "My friend, my friend!
That was the most foul and infamous part of Judas's plot. The two
doctrines he created, which appear diametrically opposed, are one
and the same evil thing. Each bears the seeds of the destruction
of humanity. I would not mind that so much," he added with a grim
smile, "but they will wreck Hell itself, and you poor fools
cannot recognise that fact."</p>

<p>He sat for a moment, and tossed his head and laughed. "Forgive
me Tydvil, but I feel sore. The only satisfaction is that I have
only been betrayed once, while humanity has been betrayed
twice."</p>

<p>Just then the sound of raised voices outside could be heard
indistinctly through the closed door. Tydvil started up. "Great
Scot! That's Amy!" Then, to Nicholas, "Please keep her out of
here, Nicholas, while you're here at any rate."</p>

<p>Nicholas laughed gently. "No need to worry for the time being,
she and our Miss Brand appear to have a good deal to
discuss."</p>

<p>And so it was. True to his word Billy had made time to come to
Geraldine. Seated on the edge of her table, and close to her, his
hand was resting gently on her shoulder as they talked. It was a
secluded backwater of the building where only those came who had
business with Tydvil. It. was not unnatural, therefore, that as
they talked Billy leaned over and pressed his lips to the richly
dowered head.</p>

<p>The gasped "William!" that reached their ears was the first
notice they had of the presence of Amy, who glared in furious
unbelief at the one whom she imagined to be set high above other
men.</p>

<p>Geraldine and Billy stared blankly as the fierce apparition
bore down on them. Amy looked, as she was, past discretion.</p>

<p>"Keep cool, Billy," whispered Geraldine, "she's fighting
mad."</p>

<p>The estimate was no exaggeration. "Nice behaviour t" Snorted
Amy. "You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Miss Brand."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Miss Brand, with provocative innocence.</p>

<p>"You will be good enough to remember to whom you are speaking,
your insolence is insufferable." Amy was very red of face.</p>

<p>"I should say," there was frozen vitriol in Geraldine's voice,
"that you are a better judge of insolence than of behaviour."</p>

<p>Amy gasped. She turned to Billy, who was wondering just how
the situation could be handled without a catastrophe. "William,"
she almost hissed, "will you try to explain your behaviour, and
this dreadful woman's."</p>

<p>Billy was prepared to listen to anything within reason, Amy
said of him, but he was not in a humour to hear Geraldine called
a dreadful woman.</p>

<p>"As Miss Brand and I are to be married, Mrs. Jones, I object
to hearing you or anyone else speak of her in those terms," he
said warmly.</p>

<p>"You! You dare to tell me that! You dare to tell me that you
are going to marry this shameless creature?" Amy stuttered.</p>

<p>Before Billy could return to the attack, Geraldine's cool
voice broke in: "I may be shameless to permit my fiance to kiss
me here, in this office, but I am not a married woman, and I have
not been shameless enough to allow another woman's fiance to kiss
me, publicly, in the Botanical Gardens."</p>

<p>"Gerry!" gasped Billy, wondering if he heard aright. Amy
almost reeled under the blow. "How dare you utter such an
abominable insinuation!" she raged.</p>

<p>Geraldine laid a restraining hand on Billy's arm. He was
exhibiting symptoms of detonation. "If you must know, I have
always considered you a canting hypocrite, and I bet Mr. Brewer
sixpence that he could not make love to you and kiss you. I was
there when he did it. It was on September fifth, in the
afternoon."</p>

<p>The crimson face went pale. She glared from one to the other.
Billy stood staring at Geraldine wondering whether he or she had
gone crazy. But there was a flicker in her eye that warned him
she was bad rather than mad.</p>

<p>Amy's expression as she turned to Billy was fiendish. "Is
that&mdash;true?" she snarled.</p>

<p>Only Billy's utter confidence in Geraldine's ability to handle
the situation she had created enabled him to bear up and rally to
her help. Said he, quite unabashed, "It was only intended as a
joke, Mrs. Jones."</p>

<p>Geraldine with difficulty repressed a giggle.</p>

<p>Amy made no attempt to repress anything. She opened her mouth
and let it say all it liked. She began with, "You cur! You
unspeakable hound! You cowardly ruffian! There are no words a
self-respecting woman can use that can describe such a dastardly
lying brute as you are. You have dared to conspire with this
shameless creature to humiliate a woman who trusted you&mdash;who
thought you a man and, heaven forgive me, an honourable
man&mdash; I..."</p>

<p>And on she raged while Geraldine, listening, quickly raised
her telephone from its stand, pressed a button, spoke a few
words, and replaced the instrument. Then she started to her feet
and interposed herself between Billy and the fury of Amy, cutting
off the tempest of abuse.</p>

<p>"You can keep out of this, Billy," she commanded. "It's my
affair, and I've been waiting for this for a long, long
time."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I cannot compete in an argument with a..."</p>

<p>Amy dropped a word that made Billy see red. It filled
Geraldine with cold, implaccable rage. She towered over Amy,
silencing Billy with a glance.</p>

<p>"Now you'll listen to me." Her voice was as cold as her wrath.
She did not raise it; in low, level tones, she painted Amy Jones
as she saw her with another woman's insight and intuition.
Savagely she stripped Amy of her armour of self-satisfaction and
conceit. It was merciless and pitiless. She outlined Amy's life
and works, and hypocrisies, in words that stung, each a separate
hornet, against which there was no defence.</p>

<p>In Tydvil's office he had listened to Geraldine's words on the
telephone, and had replaced the instrument with a slight smile.
He and Nicholas had been sitting exchanging desultory sentences,
as men will, when all has been said between them, and they await
the moment of parting.</p>

<p>"Geraldine!" he explained to Nicholas as he put down the
receiver.</p>

<p>The room had gradually grown darker. A low rumble of thunder
came through the partly opened window.</p>

<p>"Sounds like a storm coming," remarked Tydvil as he raised his
head.</p>

<p>Nicholas laughed. "That is my escort coming, Tydvil." Tydvil
glanced at him a question.</p>

<p>"Really it is," Nicholas assured him. "Lucifer, my commander-
in-chief, loves to do these things in style. I expect he's turned
out the entire black guard with an artillery division to ride
back with me."</p>

<p>"Sounds noisy," was Tydvil's comment as another and nearer
peal rumbled overhead.</p>

<p>"She's having a lively time, I imagine," Nicholas returned to
Geraldine's affairs.</p>

<p>"From the suggestion she made, I think you're right," agreed
Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Suggestion!" Nicholas became alert. It wanted ten minutes to
midday.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing much," said Tydvil almost indifferently, "but it
is one small last service you can do for me, Nicholas."</p>

<p>"Delighted, of course," Nicholas responded warmly. "What is
it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I want you to put a curb on Amy's tongue&mdash;say, to
reduce her verbal output to about one-sixteenth of its present
flow." Tydvil was selecting another cigar as he spoke and did not
see the expression in Nicholas's eyes.</p>

<p>"Was that Geraldine's suggestion?" There was a queer ring in
Nicholas's voice.</p>

<p>"Yes." Tydvil was intent on his cigar. "I should have thought
of it myself." He looked up as he spoke. Nicholas was regarding
him with curious intentness. "Great Scott! Nicholas," he asked in
concern, "is here anything wrong?"</p>

<p>"It entirely depends on the viewpoint," Nicholas said.</p>

<p>Then he leaned back and laughed without restraint. "What on
earth...?" Tydvil began.</p>

<p>"The red-head wins," gasped Nicholas at last.</p>

<p>Tydvil looked at him bewildered. "How&mdash;wins what?"</p>

<p>Nicholas drew his wallet from his pocket and extracted the
Bill Tydvil signed three months earlier. "Just this, my friend,"
he said. "You have asked me to reduce Mrs. Jones's flow of talk
to one-sixteenth of its present volume. What you apparently do
not know it, that neither her Creator, nor I nor man can by any
power or persuasion reduce the flow of any woman's talk by one
word or one syllable against her will."</p>

<p>"You mean...?" Tydvil stared at him incredulous.</p>

<p>"I have failed in my last service to you&mdash;and believe me,
Tydvil, it is the one I would most gladly perform if I could.</p>

<p>"So that..." He nodded at the Bill in Nicholas's hand.</p>

<p>"This is null and void." Nicholas was rereading his
endorsement.</p>

<p>"It seems so simple though." Tydvil's voice was full of
wonder.</p>

<p>"So simple&mdash;yet the only thing in the Universe that is
impossible."</p>

<p>"I just can't understand," said Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Listen, my friend. When the Creator first formed woman, and
the work was completed, it was discovered, too late, that one of
the assisting angels had omitted to adjust the brake on her
tongue. The mistake was irreparable, and beyond even the power of
the Creator to remedy."</p>

<p>"And mankind has suffered for it ever since," sighed
Tydvil.</p>

<p>Nicholas nodded. "But the wrath of the Creator was so great
that he ordered a terrible punishment to the erring' angel. He
decreed that so long as mankind lived on earth, that angel should
take human form, to be reincarnated through all time, and in each
incarnation to be a married man."</p>

<p>"What a fearful fate," murmured Tydvil, sympathetically.</p>

<p>Nicholas nodded his agreement. "But the worst part of the
punishment was that through all his reincarnation he would know
himself to be the missing angel and to realise the paradise he
had lost."</p>

<p>"But can't he tell his wife he is the angel?" asked
Tydvil.</p>

<p>"To guard against that, the Creator ordained that throughout
time, every married man should always believe himself to be a
missing angel. So, as all men try to persuade their wives they
are angels, the real angel's wife always regards him as being
like the rest of them, and no better than them."</p>

<p>"Terrible," murmured Tydvil, "why, I might be&mdash;I'm sure
lam..."</p>

<p>"So are all the rest," Nicholas said, holding out the Bill to
Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Au revoir, my friend."</p>

<p>Tydvil reached out to take the Bill. As he did so there was a
crash and a blinding flash of light. The window and the glass
walls of Tydvil's office clashed down in clang of broken glass.
Tydvil was flung to the floor beside his splintered writing
table. One sleeve was almost torn out of his coat. As the smoke
cleared he recovered his shocked senses.</p>

<p>Geraldine, Amy and Billy, turned and rushed to the shattered
walls. Staring through, they beheld a dishevelled Tydvil sitting
on the ruins of his chair, by the remains of his table. He still
held his smoking cigar in the corner of his mouth, and he was
turning over, with evident interest, a scorched piece of paper he
held in his hand.</p>

<p>It was Amy who first found her voice. "Tydvil!" she exclaimed
dramatically, "this is a visitation of heaven."</p>

<p>"Fat lot you know!" came the rude and truculent answer from a
belligerent Tydvil.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" asked Geraldine anxiously.</p>

<p>Tydvil regarded the three with interest. "Come in here the
three of you, and don't stand gaping there." Then, to the white-
faced crowd of employees who had rushed to the scene, "Clear out,
you people," he shouted. "There's nothing wrong&mdash;only a
flash of lightning."</p>

<p>Putting her hand through the broken pane, Geraldine opened the
shattered door and the three joined Tydvil as he scrambled to his
feet.</p>

<p>"I hope, if there is any decency left in you, Tydvil," Amy
took the floor, "that this will be a terrible warning to
you."</p>

<p>Disregarding her words entirely, he surveyed the three; then
he fixed his eyes on Amy. "You two," he said with a glance at
Geraldine and Billy, "know as much of my affairs as I
do&mdash;nearly. So I don't mind your hearing what I am going to
say." Then, to Amy, "I'm absolutely fed up of you and all your
works. Now, here's my only offer. Either you give me a judicial
separation or I'll sue for divorce, and, by Jove, I'll get
it!"</p>

<p>"You! You divorce me?" Amy gasped.</p>

<p>Tydvil stepped close to her, bent his head and murmured some
words in her ear.</p>

<p>Amy paled and stepped back with terror in her eyes. "Well!" he
snapped. "Separation or Divorce?"</p>

<p>"I will have to submit to your cruelty," Amy stammered. "Then
get out of this and wait at home till you hear from me."</p>

<p>With one savage glance at Geraldine, Amy turned and walked out
of the room.</p>

<p>"What on earth was the row about?" demanded Geraldine.
"Where's Mr. Senior?"</p>

<p>"Thanks to you," Tydvil held out the note on which the word
"Cancelled" appeared in scorched letters.</p>

<p>Her eyes lit up. "It worked?"</p>

<p>"It did," agreed Tydvil looking round the wrecked room.</p>

<p>"What worked?" asked the bewildered Billy.</p>

<p>"Best not tell him, Geraldine," grinned Tydvil, "the news
would scare him too much."</p>

<p>"She's scared me enough already this morning," growled Billy.
"So I won't ask any more questions."</p>

<p>Tydvil looked to Geraldine for enlightenment, and Geraldine
told her story.</p>

<p>"You mean to tell me that you put that on to poor Billy? You
ought to spank her," laughed Tydvil.</p>

<p>"She deserves it, but she has me scared, Chief," grinned
Billy. "I'd never know what she'd do next."</p>

<p>"Oh! by the way," Tydvil said, "I forgot to tell you. You're
both sacked."</p>

<p>"Chief!" expostulated Billy.</p>

<p>"What gratitude." Geraldine laughed. "I've saved your body
from Amy and your soul from your friend&mdash;and you sack
me..."</p>

<p>"Billy," Tydvil commanded, "take that woman some where and
marry her as soon as you can. She's not safe to be left lying
about loose..."</p>

<p>"You're not as cracked as I thought you were," retorted Billy
audaciously.</p>

<p>"I hope I'm not," Tydvil went on, "because I'm off to Europe
for a holiday next month, and you, Billy, are going to manage C.
B. &amp; D. in my place..."</p> <hr>

<p>And now, gentle reader, should you be a woman and married, I
have written this story to tell you why you should be patient and
gentle with him. Because he really believes he is an
angel&mdash;that is his fate. And besides, he really might be.
You never know your luck, and that missing angel is somewhere in
the world.</p>
