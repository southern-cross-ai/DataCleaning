<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Soon after the death of Sir William Hartley I was invited by his family to
write his Life. It was not possible for me to decline the invitation, though I
was already committed to a heavy programme of literary work. We had been united
by a long and intimate friendship; we had been fellow-labourers in a common
task; I held him in the highest esteem and cherished for him a loyal affection.
More over it was due to his initiative that I left Oxford to enter the service
of my own Church. I could do no other, then, than respond to this last
obligation of friendship. Yet I was conscious that in some ways I might be
unfitted for the task. The world of business, in which he achieved so
resounding a success, is territory which I have left almost unexplored; and the
technicalities of manufacture are, if possible, even more unfamiliar. But it
was the wish of the family, as it was in harmony with my own instinct, that the
emphasis of the biography should lie on the personality of the man and on his
activities so far as they disclosed it, rather than on the mere facts in
themselves or the steps by which he rose till he became one of the merchant
princes of our land.</p>

<p>In fulfilment of this design I have not attempted to write a continuous
record of events. The thread of biography would have failed me again and again.
For while the life of Sir William was rich in action far beyond the common
measure, it was not the kind of action which could readily be recorded in a
connected narrative. I quickly recognized that the material must be handled
according to subject rather than forced into a chronological scheme. The facts,
so far as it was possible to ascertain them, could still secure a place in the
record; but they are more appropriately grouped on this method, and their
significance is more clearly revealed. Nevertheless it has been possible to
throw part of the material into the more strictly narrative form, especially
the story of his earlier and of his closing years, together with a summary of
the part he played in the affairs of his Church.</p>

<p>In any account of his career a large place must inevitably be given to his
work for his own denomination. Not one of his Church's many activities failed
to secure his sympathy and co-operation. An ample proportion of the book has
accordingly been devoted to the service he rendered in this sphere. And since
many will be interested in his life to whom the history of the denomination and
its institutions and the conditions under which its work is done will be
unknown, it has been necessary to insert a brief account of the origin and
characteristics of early Primitive Methodism and to supplement this by
statements on the various aspects of denominational life, apart from which the
story of his contribution would not be correctly understood or estimated at its
full value. The numerous readers who will be familiar with this already will
excuse the prominence given to these explanatory sections.</p>

<p>My thanks are due in the first place to members of Sir William's family.
Lady Hartley and Miss Hartley gave me much help at the beginning, especially as
to Sir William's earlier days. They also took me over to Colne, where, under
their guidance, I visited the Cottage Hospital, the Hartley Homes and the new
Hospital which has recently been opened. Mr. J. S. Higham, Sir William's
son-in-law, has been unfailing in the help he has given me. It was he who
conveyed to me the invitation to write the book. He sent me all the material he
could discover, welcomed me to Aintree and facilitated my inspection of the
Works. Both he and Miss Hartley have read the proofs; and I am sincerely
grateful to them for this additional guarantee of accuracy. I am indebted to my
colleague, the Rev. H. J. Pickett, for the same service. I have also to thank
Mr. Allan Rigsby, the manager at Aintree, both for the time he devoted, at a
very busy season, to taking me over the Works and for information about Sir
William and his impressions of his personality. I received similar courtesy
from Mr. Hewson, the manager of the London Works, who freely gave his time to
conducting me over the various departments. Another conversation which was very
illuminating I had with Mr. Handley, who was for thirty-three years Sir
William's secretary. The Rev. J. T. Barkby discussed various points in
connexion with the preparation of the book with me at an early stage and he
sent me some reminiscences and a personal impression which I have included in
their place. Mr. Gibbens, a son-in-law of Sir William, also took the trouble to
prepare genealogical tables for my use.</p>

<p>Several friends have sent me letters or reminiscences, of which some are
acknowledged in the book itself. For others which have not been directly used I
wish to express my thanks; they have contributed to the total impression which
lies behind what I have said, though in several cases they have simply
illustrated what was abundantly illustrated already. Among the friends who have
thus helped me I desire to mention the Rev. Joseph Ritson and the Rev. George
Trusler for reminiscences, the Rev. J. G. Bowran, the Rev. B. A. Barber and the
Rev. G. W. Meadley for letters, also the Rev. Thomas Jackson for letters sent
to the late Rev. R. S. Blair. Fortunately I had preserved a very large number
of Sir William's letters addressed to myself, and these have been of material
service in the preparation of the book. I have drawn not a little on my own
recollections which were both full and vivid.</p>

<p>I am conscious that some explanation is due for the delay in the appearance
of the book, but it has been prepared and dictated under the pressure of many
other urgent claims on my time. Even so it was my hope to have completed it a
year earlier, but this was made impossible by medical prohibitions which robbed
me of two months in the summer of 1924. Weeks and even months have not
infrequently passed in which the work has been untouched.</p>

<p>In saying farewell to a task which it has been a privilege to perform, I may
be permitted to add a few closing words. The memory of Sir William Hartley will
be cherished, not because of his wealth or even his commercial genius, but for
the lofty use to which his wealth and his genius were consecrated. His deeds of
splendid generosity are impressive when taken singly, they are overwhelming in
their mass. I have sought to uncover the roots from which so rich a fruitage
issued and disclose the forces which found so magnificent an expression. He
rose to affluence and then to vast wealth; he had exceptional capacity for
toil, amazing energy and driving power, the genius to conceive, the strength to
execute lofty designs, the gift of rising to the level of an occasion and doing
great things in a great way. His rich and many-sided personality had been
captured by a religion enlightened and ethical, but redeemed from cold
intellectualism or a frigid legalism by the emotion which glowed at the centre.
He looked out upon the world, he saw its misery and was filled with compassion.
His sympathies were strong and deep; he was pitiful in the presence of sorrow
and pain. "There is much misery in the world," he once said to me, "and few
know so much of it as I do." Disease and poverty were enemies to be fought. The
ignorance and the vice which were responsible for so much physical and moral
defect must be attacked not simply in themselves but in their roots. The spread
of knowledge, the destruction of barriers, the creation of a social conscience,
the quickening of a sensitiveness to social and moral evils which was numb
through habit and conventionality, these were the means by which our sorely
wounded social system might find relief. And so he fought disease by hospital
and sanatorium and the endowment of medical research. He fought ignorance by
the ample provision he made for University and College and the circulation of
the best books. He alleviated the evils of poverty by a just and even generous
wage, by profit-sharing and provision for old age, by almshouse and by
orphanage, by loans to tide people over critical periods, or by gifts to those
from whom no repayment could ever be expected.</p>

<p>And grateful tribute must be paid to the work which he did for his own
denomination. He was not a narrow ecclesiastic, his sympathies were broad as
they were deep. But he recognized that the communion in which he had been
placed had the first claim on his loyalty and service. His gifts of money made
much possible which could not have been other wise achieved. But they were
rendered far more valuable, partly by the use he made of them to elicit help
from others, partly by the extreme care he took to secure that the money should
be used to the best advantage. Above all, his statesmanship was one of the most
precious assets of his Church. He had the vision to see great opportunities,
the resourcefulness and skill to utilize them, the energy to carry the causes
he advocated to triumph. He struck with unexampled force into the stream of
denominational activity, lifting its quality to higher levels, accelerating the
pace of its progress, making possible otherwise impracticable enterprises.
Splendid as were his gifts, his leadership was even more far-reaching in its
effects. Long years were granted to him, and he filled them to the uttermost.
He raised our ideals as he expanded our resources; he was to us at once an
inspiration and a conscience. In his many-sided gifts taken singly there have
been few to emulate him, while in his combination of gifts he was unique.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3><i>Early Years - Part I</i></h3>

<p>The most exhaustive scrutiny of ancestry and environment cannot fully
explain the secret of even the most commonplace personality; much less can it
account for men of outstanding gifts and achievement. Yet it may help us in a
measure to understand even a character and a career so rare as that of Sir
William Hartley, if we consider the stock from which he sprang and the
conditions which moulded him in the most plastic period of his life.</p>

<p>The impression that his ancestors belonged to the poorer working classes is
incorrect; and to heighten the marvel of his career, too much has often been
made of his early disadvantages. "The Hartley family," we learn, "are typical
Lancashire yeomen. They can trace their ancestry back to the early seventeenth
century; indeed, one branch of the family--Sir William's uncle, Richard
Hartley--lived at Barley, under the shadow of Pendle, in a house which, as the
date-stone shows, had been in the possession of the Hartley family since 1620.
There is also an East Lancashire tradition that the family is of Huguenot
stock, and it is associated by marriage with the well-known East Lancashire
families of Lister, Pickles, and Horsfield."[*]</p>

<p>[*] <i>Southport Guardian</i>, October 28, 1922.</p>

<p>Sir William was born at Colne, a small but pleasant little town in East
Lancashire on the edge of Yorkshire, a few miles north of Burnley. It is
situated on a high ridge and is affectionately called by its inhabitants
"Bonnie Colne-on-the-Hill." Tourists often take it as their starting-point when
they are visiting the Bronte country. How deep were the ties which bound him
and Lady Hartley to their birthplace will be clear from this biography; but it
will be fitting at this point to quote from the speech he delivered on the
occasion when he laid the foundation-stone of the Hospital they presented to
Colne, September 3, 1921. "I am now in my seventy-sixth year, and it is
forty-seven years since I removed from Colne; but my wife and I never forget
that we were born in Colne, and in the erection of this hospital we have
endeavoured to show in a practical manner our affection for our native
town."</p>

<p>The qualities which made him so successful as a man of business were
probably derived in large measure from Christopher Lister, his
great-grandfather on the father's side. He had the largest ironmongery in
Colne. His death was sudden, and occurred in his carriage at the gates of
Horsfield Cottage, his residence. His daughter became the wife of William
Hartley, a schoolmaster at Trawden. He was a man of considerable ability, great
religious fervour and moral passion. At first a Wesleyan local preacher, he
later joined the Primitive Methodists, and was urged to enter the ministry.
This, however, through diffidence, he declined to do, though he lamented his
refusal in after years. He became in later life a town-missionary in the Isle
of Man, and died during an epidemic of fever which claimed him as its victim,
as with self-effacing devotion he ministered to the needs of others. His eldest
son, Robert Hartley, Sir William's uncle, was a man of very handsome presence
and exceptionally fine character. He became a Primitive Methodist minister at
an early age, and after spending a quarter of a century in England, went to
Australia and laboured for thirty-two years in Queensland. One feature of his
many-sided activity was his kindness to the emigrants from England whom he met
at the landing-stage. His home was at Rockhampton on the coast; but he covered
a wide field, reaching from Brisbane nearly to the Gulf of Carpentaria. He was
apparently too much occupied to send home reports of his work; so Dr. Samuel
Antliff, when he was sent to visit Australia, was instructed to make
investigations. He found him the leading man in Rockhampton. His
fellow-citizens celebrated his ministerial Jubilee and presented him with a
purse of gold; and after his death dedicated a public fountain to his memory. A
Hartley Memorial Chapel also commemorates his work. A letter from Dr. McLaren
may fitly be quoted at this point. It was written on July 23, 1892.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hartley was in Southampton during several years of my pastorate there,
when I learned to esteem him very highly for his earnestness, warmth of heart,
bright temperament, diligence and self-forgetfulness. I had the pleasure of a
visit from him when he was in England some years since, and have always
cherished warm feelings of friendship for him. I share with your denomination
the sense of loss by his death, and should be glad if you would tell Mr.
Hartley of Aintree how truly I esteemed and honoured his uncle."</p>

<p>John Hartley, the second son of William and the brother of Robert Hartley,
was the father of Sir William. He was born on July 13, 1824. He was a kind,
good man, a Primitive Methodist local preacher and class leader, but he had no
special aptitude for affairs. In his later years he assisted in his son's
business. He was the medium of communication between the work people and the
Chief. His sympathetic nature found abundant exercise in the help he gave to
people in trouble. He died on January 27, 1892, at the age of sixty-seven. He
married Miss Margaret Pickles, who was born on April 20, 1824. She was very
tall and not strong, and died on May 18, 1870, at the age of forty-six. From
her Sir William derived much of his brain power. He was her only child who
survived early infancy. He was born February 23, 1846. His first Christian name
was that of his grandfather, his second was the maiden name of his mother.</p>

<p>At that time it was quite usual for children to be taken from school and
sent to work at a very early age. But his parents, recognizing his exceptional
qualities, gave him an unusually good education for boys of his class. He was
sent to the British School till he was thirteen and then for a year to the
Grammar School. One accomplishment, for which he was distinguished, was
ornamental penmanship. His uncle, Robert Hartley, left England about the time
when his nephew's education was nearing completion and expressed the opinion
that William would not make much out of life. Others formed a truer judgment of
his qualities. When he was quite young a Roman Catholic priest at Colne tried
to have him educated for the priesthood It was also suggested that he should be
trained as a lawyer; but his mother, who shared the pessimistic estimate of the
legal profession which is all too prevalent, objected that the untruthfulness
it tended to foster would be damaging to his spiritual interests.</p>

<p>His own wish, on leaving school at the age of fourteen, was to become a
chemist. But there was no opening in Colne, so he began work by helping his
mother in the grocery shop which she kept. So tiny a sphere offered him no
scope, and when a suitable shop became vacant in the main street of Colne he
urged his parents to take it. They were aghast at the suggestion, believing
that nothing but financial ruin could be the result of so rash an enterprise;
and the boy might not have gained his opportunity had not a business man in the
town, of larger experience and prescience than the parents, warmly commended
his proposal. Lady Hartley still vividly remembers across the intervening sixty
years a visit of his mother to her home and her gloomy forebodings that
William's headstrong rashness would ruin them all. But her fears were
falsified. Starting at the age of sixteen in business for himself, he quickly
justified his refusal to move in the old ruts. He combined a dry saltery with
his grocery business at Colne. But he was quick to see that a wholesale
department would help the retail business and at the same time give him the
opportunity for widening the range of his operations. Accordingly he built up a
trade in grocers' sundries in the villages and towns round Colne. At the outset
the way was very difficult and only the most strenuous determination and
unfaltering perseverance could have made this new venture a success. Long
after-wards when he acknowledged the presentation of the Freedom of Colne on
November 12, 1909, he said: "My pleasant visit to Colne to-day awakens memories
of the past. When the Mayor brought me to his house this afternoon on Keighley
Road, it reminded me that forty-six or forty-seven years ago I walked the same
road, and on through Laneshaw-bridge over Lancashire Moor to Stanbury, journey
by journey, starting from my home in Colne Lane before five o'clock in the
morning, calling upon my first customer at about seven o'clock. I walked to
Haworth, Oak-worth and to Keighley Station, so tired that I was very glad to
sit down in the station. I walked about twenty miles, I had called on twenty
customers, and on many a journey I did not make a shilling. It took a good deal
of resolution to keep that up."</p>

<p>When he was twenty he was married to Miss Martha Horsfield, the daughter of
Henry and Ann Horsfield, grocers of Colne. Her home, as Sir William recalled
when he received the Freedom of his native town, stood on the site on which the
Town Hall in which it was presented to him, was subsequently erected. She was
the youngest of thirteen children. Her father was a Wesleyan; but she with some
of her sisters attended the Church of England. She became attached to the
Primitive Methodists when she was fourteen because they had been so kind to her
sister in her illness. When they celebrated their golden wedding in 1916, Sir
William gave a very interesting account of their honeymoon to the staff of the
businesses in Liverpool and London, at a dinner on May 27. He said: "We were
married on a Whit-Monday morning, which in that year (1866) was May 21.
Holidays were then a very rare thing in our native town of Colne. Indeed, we
scarcely knew that the word 'holiday' was in the language. However, we were
quite as happy with half a day on that Whit-Monday as we have been since with a
month's holiday. On that afternoon we spent our honeymoon in processioning the
town of Colne with the Sunday School scholars and singing the special
Whitsuntide hymns in the principal streets of our native town; and I was at
business as usual next morning as though nothing had happened."</p>

<p>All who know in any degree the happiness of that union will recognize how
fortunate he was in his choice; and if deeper and higher instincts were not
involved than wisdom in the conduct of affairs, it might truthfully be said
that he never gave a finer example of his sagacity than in the selection of his
wife. Of all that they meant to each other and to their family it would not be
fitting to speak save with reticence; and what must be said should be reserved
for a later point in the story. But in all his business career she was his
constant and his wisest adviser. She firmly supported him in his splendid
service to religion, philanthropy and education, though striving to temper his
enthusiasm when she felt that it carried him beyond the bounds of proper regard
for his own health and comfort. In this respect, it is to be feared, that he
was sometimes less amenable to her restraining influence than she desired. Her
caution and her coolness, her foresight and sound sense, were invaluable
qualities. She had a firm grasp of his business in its many ramifications and
an intimate familiarity with it. It meant much to her husband that he could
always turn to her for sagacious counsel and candid criticism.</p>

<p>It was through an accident that Mr. Hartley became a manufacturer of jam. He
entered into a contract with a local grocer to make jam for him. The grocer did
not fulfil his contract; and the case was submitted to friendly arbitration,
which went in Mr. Hartley's favour. He decided, however, to terminate the
arrangement and to manufacture jam on his own account. He felt this to be the
more necessary that he was already gaining a reputation for this class of goods
and he was determined not to disappoint his customers. He resolved from the
first that the quality should be the best he could produce, no matter what the
price he would be compelled to charge. People thought this principle was much
too optimistic and that he would not hold out long enough for the public to
discover the excellence of his wares. But he was resolute in his fidelity to
this ideal and adhered to it throughout his business career. The materials he
used were of the best, he watched every detail of manufacture and insisted that
the whole process should be conducted with the utmost care to secure perfect
cleanliness. The people were quick to recognize the excellence of the product;
and as it was sold at a reasonable price the business rapidly developed. At
last the problem forced itself upon him whether it would not be wise to remove
his business from Colne, especially as it was desirable to lessen the cost of
the carriage of fruit and sugar. He finally decided to leave Colne and build a
jam factory at Bootle. His friends and family were unanimous against the
project. He had an excellent business in Colne and the prospect of steady
development; and he seemed to them to be sacrificing a secure and promising
position for what might prove to be a mere mirage. When he was President of the
Primitive Methodist Conference in June, 1909, he spoke of his decision to leave
Colne and build a small works near to Liverpool as a most important, decisive
and far-reaching step. He added: "This was against the advice of my family and
friends, who viewed the step as an expression of vaulting ambition. They all
believed I was flying in the face of Providence and prophesied disaster. There
was no exception to the adverse criticism. Whenever I look back upon that
stirring period of my life, I often think how careful we should be in forming
adverse views as to the conduct of others for fear that our criticism should
prove to be wrong. It was so in my case."</p>

<p>He passed through a period of great distress and anxiety, he felt his
isolation keenly, all the more that his friends were convinced that the
disaster would be irretrievable. But he had the courage of his convictions and
in 1874 the business was removed to Bootle.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that he ran a very big risk and that the prospects at
the outset were such as to discourage the most optimistic. He had sunk the
whole of his capital in the new building and nothing was left for fruit or
sugar. For this he was relying on money which had been lent to him. At this
juncture the lender threatened to withdraw the money unless Mr. Hartley would
make him his partner. His wife wisely warned him that he could not do with a
partner; and the condition on which the loan was to be continued was refused.
It was necessary for him to borrow money and he had to make a hard bargain with
necessity. The money was advanced to him on very onerous terms. The loan was to
run for seven years and the interest swallowed up seventy-five per cent. of the
profits. Long before the date fixed upon for its expiration Mr. Hartley would
have been glad to repay it; but those from whom he had borrowed it refused to
release him earlier.</p>

<p>Confronted by grave difficulties, hampered by insufficiency of capital,
carrying the burden of his heavy indebtedness, he found his energies taxed to
the uttermost. Long hours, during which his great powers of work and his
magnificent organizing abilities were strained almost beyond endurance, and the
inevitable financial worry told upon his health. That he achieved so much in
later life was the more amazing that he permanently bore the scars of those
earlier years upon him. In the address he gave to his staff on the occasion of
his golden wedding he said: "For a number of years in our early days we had
great difficulties, and our first struggles were severe indeed." But it was in
those days of strain, struggle and anxiety that the foundations of his vast
business were well and truly laid. The quality of his manufactures became more
and more widely known and the works he had built at Bootle proved too small.
Extension became necessary. In due course a second enlargement was required,
and once more the volume of business outgrew the capacity of the building.
Since the limit of expansion had been reached he decided to build new works at
Aintree and this project was carried into effect in 1886. He resided at Bootle
for six years, then at Southport and subsequently at Birkdale. He removed to
Aintree at the end of October, 1890. From Aintree he removed to "Sea View,"
Southport, in 1904, and then to Birkdale in 1919.</p>

<p>During their residence at Colne the home of Mr. and Mrs. Hartley was
enriched by the coming of four daughters and in the Bootle period the family
was completed by four daughters and one son. In the year after the business was
transferred to Bootle the fourth daughter died at the age of eighteen months.
The rest of the family survived their father, though the grief occasioned by
the loss of the husband and father was renewed only a little later by the death
of the son and brother.</p>

<h3><i>Early Years - Part II</i></h3>

<p>So far nothing has been said of what must throughout be one of the most
prominent features in a biography of this kind--his relation to religion and
the Church.</p>

<p>He came of Primitive Methodist stock and was, in fact, a Primitive Methodist
of the third generation. William Hartley, his grandfather, passed over from the
Wesleyans to the Primitive Methodists and died in that communion as a town
missionary in the Isle of Man. His father and mother belonged to it, his father
being a local preacher and a class leader. At the time of his birth the
denomination had been in existence thirty-five years. It had originated in the
Potteries during the closing years of the first decade of the nineteenth
century. Stimulated by the accounts of the success which had attended the
American camp meetings, two fervent Wesleyan local preachers, Hugh Bourne and
William Clowes, with some of their friends, held a camp meeting on Mow Cop, in
1807. The Wesleyan Conference, believing that camp meetings, however suitable
to America, were undesirable in England, passed a resolution forbidding such
gatherings to be held. Since their promoters, full of evangelistic zeal,
refused to comply, first Hugh Bourne and then later William Clowes were removed
from the roll of membership. As the work continued it became necessary to form
Society classes and soon a new denomination was formed. The feeling of its
leaders that they were recovering the methods employed in original or, as it
was not infrequently termed at an even earlier period, primitive Methodism,
found expression in the title by which it was officially designated The
Primitive Methodist Connexion. It spread with amazing rapidity, though with
some set-backs; and at the time of Mr. Hartley's birth the membership stood at
over 87,000. The evangelistic spirit was still strong, but the period of
consolidation had set in; and the membership was recruited, not only from the
masses who were unattached to any form of religious organization, but from
those who had been born in Primitive Methodist homes. The organization was
framed on the Wesleyan model, though with a much greater emphasis on the rights
of the laity. The forms of worship were also similar to those of the Mother
Church, but they were more spontaneous and less restrained and spiritual
raptures not infrequently found a corybantic expression. Theology was, as
almost everywhere in English Christianity at the time, rigidly orthodox. Verbal
inspiration, a substitutionary theory of the Atonement, the unalterable
determination of future destiny at death, eternal punishment including physical
torment in fire, were accepted without question. But the theology was also
specifically Methodist with great stress on experience. While gradual
conversion might not be denied, it was normally expected to be instantaneous
and catastrophic; and the shock of contrast betwen the old and the new also led
to much emphasis on the inner witness of the Spirit. Entire sanctification, to
be received by faith, was also presented as the privilege of all believers,
which might, like justification, be instantaneously achieved by an act of
faith. The preachers proclaimed "a free, full, and present salvation,
obtainable now." Much stress was laid on testimony, to be given in the open air
or in the love feasts, or in the factory. The most characteristic Methodist
institution was the class meeting in which each member related his spiritual
experience to his fellow-members and received from the leader such warning,
encouragement or counsel as his case seemed to demand. Personal evangelism had
from the first characterized the movement. Great importance was attached to the
training of children. But the rules required a certain age to be attained
before any could be accepted into membership. When Mr. Hartley was
Vice-President of the Conference he strongly criticized the postponement of
membership in the case of young people reared in Christian homes. Speaking in
June, 1892, he said: "I have been a member of our Connexion for about
thirty-two years, ever since I was of the proper age; and I might have been a
member sooner had the rules of the Connexion allowed. I have long been of the
opinion that we lose the membership of thousands of our young people who are
reared in Christian homes through not having some system of enrolling their
names as members at an early age. We have too long acted as though it was
necessary for our young people to indulge more or less in worldliness and sin,
and after a certain time to be converted and received into the Church. I have
little sympathy with this view. I think the children of godly parents should be
received into Church fellowship, and taught to adorn the doctrines of our
Saviour from an early age, and gradually grow up into strong Christ-like
characters." He repeated this protest in 1909 when he was President of the
Conference.</p>

<p>It was expected of all Church members that they should exhibit a walk and
conduct worthy of the Gospel. Regular attendance at the religious services,
very strict Sabbath observance, abstinence from what were styled "vain and
worldly amusements," in which dancing, the theatre, and card-playing were
included, regular contributions towards the expenses of the Society with which
the member was connected, and of the circuit to which the Society belonged,
were required from all members, together, it goes without saying, with strict
obedience to the weightier matters of the moral law. The consequence was that
the social life of the members was concentrated on a small scale in their
homes, while on a larger scale it had its centre in their chapel. There was a
great spirit of cameraderie. Work, of course, was hard and the hours of labour
were long; but the week-night preaching service, the class meeting, the
tea-meeting followed by the public meeting, the sewing-meeting for the sale of
work or the bazaar, the choir practice, the occasional entertainment or
lecture, the anniversary of the chapel or the school, provided very rich
opportunities for the cultivation of the spiritual life and the satisfaction of
the religious instincts. Sunday was, of course, a very full day. On this I am
glad to be able to quote Sir William's own testimony given in June, 1909, when
he was President of the Conference. He describes his typical Sunday while he
was at Colne.</p>

<p>"In those early days I paid the closest attention to my business, but on
Sundays I always devoted the whole day to work in connexion with the chapel. At
the present time some of our young people think that the services are too
frequent. Fifty years ago my Sunday duty was: Sunday School 9 o'clock, service
at 10.30, school at 1.15, afternoon service at 2.30, evening service at 6,
prayer meeting at 7.30, and occasionally an open-air mission at 5.30 previous
to the evening service. I attended all these services at the time, and it never
occurred to me that I was doing anything exceptional. I took it as a matter of
course as I did my business duties on the week-day."</p>

<p>There was a clear line of demarcation between those who were members of the
Society and those who were simply adherents. The qualification for membership
was in the first instance, as with the Wesleyans, "a desire to flee from the
wrath to come"; and a member had to be on trial at least three months before he
was admitted to full membership. As he had to attend the class meeting, where
inquiries were regularly made as to the progress of his religious life, it is
obvious that the elementary qualification required for membership on trial had
to be completed by a definitely Christian experience. Normally it may be said
that conversion was taken as the indispensable qualification for membership.
The distinction between the member and the adherent, however, was not
necessarily a distinction between the converted and the unconverted. There were
those who regularly attended the services and supported the Church and its
institutions, who might have claimed that they were true members of the Church
of Christ but for some reason or other stood outside the membership of the
Society, and hence were not enrolled in the membership of the denomination. But
the distinction did in large measure hold good. Of course the adherents were
not subject to the discipline of the Church or taxed for its support. Nor did
they participate in its fellowship meetings. The Society naturally took no
responsibility for them; but it was the constant hope that they might cross the
decisive line which separated the saved from the unsaved.</p>

<p>Since one very important side of Mr. Hartley's denominational activities was
concerned with the easing of financial burdens and the financing of new
developments, it should be pointed out that the denomination at the time
contained extremely few wealthy people, that the number of members in easy
circumstances was not large, and that the vast majority belonged to the working
classes, earning slender and often precarious wages. The converts had
frequently been drawn from the ranks of the thriftless, the drunken and the
lazy. They had become thrifty, sober and industrious; some of them began to
rise in the social scale, and if they remained loyal to the Church which had
raised them there was often a tendency for the children to drift away into a
social environment more congenial than was provided by the little chapel. Thus
the very success of the denomination led to some measure of impoverishment. On
the other hand, the membership, which in 1846 stood at nearly 88,000, had
twenty years later risen to over 150,000, and in 1884 when Mr. Hartley made his
challenge offer, which brought him into denominational fame and initiated his
great career of service for the whole Connexion, the membership stood at over
191,000. It would have been 200,000 but for the fact that in 1883 nearly 9,000
members had been transferred to the Canadian Methodist Church when Methodist
Union was consummated in Canada. It is obvious that with a membership so
enlarged and reinforced by so considerable a number of adherents the financial
resources of the denomination were far more ample than they had been in the
early days of poverty and struggle. But liberality, which was often great and
even costly, tended to flow too much in local channels. To these Mr. Hartley
was in no way indifferent, indeed through out his career much of his time and
financial assistance was devoted to local needs. But he did a great deal to
stimulate Connexional interest. His offer in 1884 struck the denominational
imagination and not only removed the missionary debt but deepened the interest
in missions. And his unwearied exposition of the principle of systematic and
proportionate giving, of which he was himself so shining an example, did much
to diffuse a more generous temper and to create the habit of regulated rather
than spasmodic liberality.</p>

<p>It should be added that, contrary to a widespread opinion, the constitution
of the denomination was not democratic. A number of Societies were grouped into
a circuit, which was governed by the circuit Quarterly Meeting. A number of
circuits were united in a District, which held an annual district meeting. The
whole of the Districts were united in the Connexion; and the annual Conference,
which was the supreme governing body of the Church, was composed almost
entirely of representatives appointed by the District Meetings in the
proportion of two laymen to one minister. The non-official, or "private member"
as he was called, could not be sent as a delegate to Conference. And indeed, he
had practically no voice even in the management of his own circuit. The
invitation of the minister, for example, was in the hands of the Quarterly
Meeting and the rank and file of the Church members had no voice in the
selection. We are not concerned with the wisdom and justice of the system; but
as the Primitive Methodists are often described as a very democratic Church it
is desirable to make the real position clear. And it has an interesting bearing
on our immediate subject. For some time after Mr. Hartley had become the most
prominent layman in Primitive Methodism he was not eligible for election as a
delegate to Conference, even when he had become the Missionary Treasurer of the
denomination. As his presence in the Conference was of great importance, the
situation would have been much more serious if the rigid constitution had not
allowed one little loophole. The Deed Poll made provision for four other
persons than the twelve permanent, or Deed Poll, members and the delegates from
the District Meetings to be appointed by the preceding Conference. One of these
places had to be taken by the General Committee Secretary, who was charged with
the conduct of the business, so that only three places, and these much coveted,
were available. For several years Mr. Hartley, being ineligible for membership
in any other way, had to be sent as one of the "Four Persons." At length the
difficulty was met by the arrangement that the Missionary Treasurer should be
one of the delegates for the Missions District. The principle which lies behind
the constitution is that the members of the Conference should owe their
position to direct appointment and each time have to be nominated and run the
gauntlet of an election. This finds expression in the fact that the
representatives of institutions, while they must attend the Conference and
speak on their reports, and are entitled to intervene in the debate when
business affecting their department is before the Conference, nevertheless are
not members of the Conference in virtue of their office and can become members
only if they are appointed in one of the ways already indicated. In actual
practice the system works unfairly, because some officials are secure of
appointment while the great majority are not. And it is open to grave question
whether a deliberative assembly, which has to conduct the affairs of the
Church, is not seriously impoverished when, with few exceptions, those who have
the most intimate knowledge of its institutions and whose appointment ought to
be some guarantee of capacity are shut out from voice and vote in the supreme
court of the denomination.</p>

<p>Such then was the religious atmosphere and environment into which William
Hartley was born. In the address he gave as Vice-President of the Conference in
June, 1892, he said: "My parents and grandparents were godly people. I was
always under the deepest religious impressions, and I never remember a time
when I had not an earnest desire to be good." He was taken by his mother to the
class-meeting when he was five years old. At the age of thirteen he offered
himself for membership. When he presented twenty cottage homes to Colne in
October, 1911, he said: "Lady Hartley and I are to-day on familiar ground. We
were both born in Colne. We passed our early days here. We were both under the
influence of good parents and teachers here, especially at Sunday School, whose
wise counsel had a lasting effect upon us. Although we left Colne about
thirty-eight years ago, we have never forgotten the helpful influences that
surrounded us in our early days."</p>

<p>Next to the influence of his parents, and especially his mother, we should
probably place that of his Sunday School teacher, Jonathan Catlow. In later
years he often acknowledged the deep impressions made upon him by the character
of this man who in humble circumstances yet displayed not a little native
talent and width of theological outlook, combined with transparent goodness and
deep religious experience.</p>

<p>In the natural order of things Mr. Hartley would have become a local
preacher; but his failure to follow the family tradition was an illustration,
of the well-known saying that the good is often the enemy of the better. The
story is best told in his own words, addressed to the Conference at Southport,
of which he was the President.</p>

<p>"I am a Primitive of the third generation, and became a member as soon as
the rules of the Church allowed. I have been a member more than fifty years...I
never remember a time in my life when I had not a real genuine desire to serve
the Lord. My father and grandfather were both local preachers, and when I was a
small boy, I often accompanied my father to his country appointments and also
into his pulpit. I have given out a hymn many a time when I was a small boy. At
that time I had an honest desire to be a local preacher, but this was
frustrated. When I was about twelve or thirteen years of age it was decided to
have a harmonium in the chapel at Colne, my native town, and it was the earnest
wish of my parents, especially my mother, that I should learn to play; and with
some financial strain they placed me under a music teacher and purchased a
small harmonium for my use at home, with the sole and only object of my
officiating at the instrument in the chapel. I have this harmonium now in my
house. My idea of being a local preacher was of necessity completely abandoned
owing to my duty at the harmonium...I was organist in the Colne chapel for
sixteen years until I was twenty-eight."</p>

<p><a name="il-3"></a><img alt="" src="0701091h-images/0701091h-03.jpg"></p>
</center>

<p>The training he would have gained as a local preacher would have been very
valuable to him in later life. Apart from its system of lay preachers,
Methodism would have been severely crippled in its activities. The whole system
lends itself to practical training in public speaking. By easy stages the
initial difficulties are surmounted, the prayer-meeting and the class-meeting
give constant opportunities at which, in early youth, the natural shyness and
awkwardness, which are so effective a barrier, are overcome. At first two or
three sentences may be put together, for no set speech is required; and at the
class meeting the members had not to face the very real trial to a beginner of
standing on his feet to address his fellows. As time goes on, other
opportunities are afforded, such as a brief Sunday School address. Gradually
confidence is gained, signs of promise are observed, the suggestion is made
that the higher work of the local preacher should be attempted. But the
candidate is not left to himself; he is placed in the care of an experienced
local preacher who takes him with him to his services and gives him the benefit
of his advice. He is not burdened by the sense that failure on his part will
involve the ruin of the service. If for ten or fifteen minutes he can acquit
himself creditably, then he is on the highroad to success. But if he cannot
sustain so long a flight, no harm is done; his mentor will easily fill the void
which his premature collapse would otherwise have created. Thus he begins his
work under the most favourable conditions and in particular he is not paralysed
by the dread that any failure of nerve on his part will involve disaster to the
service. And practice will soon enable him to make good his deficiencies and
undertake the whole service himself. But even then he has more than one stage
to pass through before he becomes a fully accredited local preacher. It is easy
to see what an advantage it is for a man who has to play his part in public
life to have gone through a training of this kind. The gift of speaking with
ease and confidence, without the painful pauses, the halting delivery, the
inarticulate ejaculations which form the stepping-stones from one coherent
phrase to another, the self-consciousness and embarrassment which ought to be,
but are not always, the accompaniment of so distressing a performance, is a
gift which is in many cases a natural endowment, but which may be acquired by
such gradual processes as those that have been described. In later life Mr.
Hartley had to speak on many public occasions and with his high
conscientiousness and very careful preparation he always acquitted himself
worthily. But public speaking was a great nervous strain to him; and if
circumstances had permitted him to train his gifts and gain facility in early
life, much expenditure of time and nervous energy would have been spared. But
naturally the work of an organist, who undertook also the duty of training the
choir, was very exacting. His presence was required at all the services in
Colne; and this was true also of his Bootle period. He bought the organ for the
Primitive Methodist Church at Bootle and acted as organist.</p>

<p>He went to the Sunday School at an early age and in due course became a
teacher. He was in other respects a very active Sunday School worker and filled
several offices beside that of teacher. He was also treasurer of the Chapel
trust and, while still quite young, was appointed to the responsible office of
circuit steward. His rise into denominational fame came in 1884, when, as will
be related in connexion with his work for the Connexional Missionary Society,
he made his challenge offer for the extinction of the debt.</p>

<p>Since the most distinctive feature of Mr. Hartley's career was his
stewardship of wealth, and the first step which led to such momentous
consequences was taken at a very early point, it is appropriate to speak of it
here, although the chief developments must be unfolded in the sequel. On
January 1, 1877, Mr. and Mrs. Hartley made a vow, which they committed to
writing, that they would set aside a specific portion of their income for
religious and philanthropic purposes. A fuller exposition of his principles and
their application must be reserved for the present, but at this point it will
be appropriate to make one or two quotations from speeches of his own. In his
Presidential Address to the Conference (1909) he said: "Probably the greatest
event of my life occurred on January 1, 1877. On that day my wife and I made a
written vow that we would devote a definite and well-considered share of our
income for religious and humanitarian work, and that this should be a first
charge, and that we should not give to the Lord something when we had finished
with everything else. Up to that time I had never heard a sermon or an address
upon systematic giving; but I was much helped in my decision by reading a small
pamphlet entitled 'Uncle Ben's Bag' by the late Rev. John Ross. This is nearly
thirty-three years ago, but since that date we have often increased the
proportion, so that the original percentage is now left far behind. As our
income has increased, we have felt that religious and humanitarian work had a
greater claim upon us. The distribution of the Lord's portion has been the
greatest joy of my life, and a real means of grace; it has kept me in constant
touch with the promotion of Christ-like work of all kinds; and anything I have
been able to do for our Church and humanity (including profit-sharing with my
workpeople for over twenty years) has grown out of the vow that my wife and I
made thirty-three years ago."</p>

<p>Seventeen years earlier in the address he gave as Vice-President of the
Conference (1892) he said: "The real, deep, lasting, and genuine happiness of
my own Christian life began about sixteen years ago, when I was led to see how
dishonouring to God it was to give money for His cause in a spasmodic manner,
and how much more satisfactory and honouring to Him it must be to give help
just in the proportion He gave to me. Let me urge you to take Him into
partnership and give Him cheerfully and ungrudgingly His share. I started
sixteen years ago with setting aside ten per cent. of my total income (I make
no deduction for household expenses, or any other expenses) and several years
ago I increased it to fifteen per cent. At the present time I am setting aside
twenty per cent.--say one-fifth of my total gross income for Christ-like
work."</p>

<p>The cynic, who prides himself on never giving people credit for good motives
when he can discover bad ones, or who is perpetually belittling noble conduct
which rebukes his own mean and paltry nature, will say that it was quite easy
for Mr. Hartley to give away large sums of money, for he was a very wealthy
man. To this it is enough to reply that the vow was deliberately made and
scrupulously kept when he was anything but wealthy. When he and his wife
decided to set aside ten per cent. of their gross income, before they touched
it for their own necessities, they had a family of six children and an income
of &pound;5 a week. But that is not all. This was in the period of acute
struggle, when capital was urgently needed for his business. And yet the
resolution to give God the first share was strictly kept.</p>

<p>When we think of all that has come out of this resolution, which was adopted
in no impulsive mood under the stimulus of some sudden but transient glow of
feeling, but had been carefully pondered and calmly and deliberately made, we
cannot help feeling that that New Year's Day was a red-letter day, and not in
their lives only.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3><i>The Manufacturer</i></h3>

<p>The removal to Aintree was determined not simply by the need for expansion
but in order to secure connexion with the railway. The new works were opened in
1886, a large warehouse was built in 1891, a second in 1899-90, a third in
1923, while a fourth is now in process of construction. The factory is
self-contained in every respect, and every trade that is necessary is
represented in it such as coopers, joiners, box-makers. The jars are made at
Melling or St. Helens. All the water needed is pumped by machinery. The factory
has its own railway sidings with two locomotives which do all the shunting. In
the busy season six trains come in during the day and two hundred waggons are
handled. Mr. Hartley chartered his ships and had his own bonded ware houses.
Two thousand boxes are often made in a day; the timber, sawn into the requisite
sizes, is imported from Norway. Twenty-eight thousand boxes had been sent out
during the week before my last visit. The works cover ten acres, and every part
has been carefully planned for its own special function and its relation to the
whole. It is interesting to record that one of the last additions which Sir
William made was intended to facilitate the motor loading. A plot used as a
garden was turned into a loading berth which has made the loading of the motors
much more easy and convenient for the workers.</p>

<p>Before reference is made to the work carried on in the factory it will be
well to complete what has been said about Aintree by reference to the London
works. For a long time Mr. Hartley's trade was almost entirely restricted to
the North and the Mid lands, and he did not seek to extend it into the South of
England. But the demand came, partly through his growing fame, partly through
the refusal of his devotees to be put off with anything but his products. It
grew so much that the necessity had to be faced either of ampler accommodation
at Aintree, or new premises in London or the neighborhood. The latter solution
was adopted. The buildings covered two acres. There were 370 tan pits and a
linoleum factory on the site. These had to be dealt with, and at a later
period, before the war, a whole street of offices had to be pulled down. The
factory was much larger than the London County Council allows any single
building to be. To minimise the risk from fire no building is allowed to
contain more than 250,000 cubic feet. Mr. Hartley's new works contained more
than 1,500,000 cubic feet. They had accordingly to be built in several sections
connected by passages, but guarded from the spread of fire by thick walls and
fireproof doors. The factory was designed to produce over four hundred tons a
week which, with the six hundred produced at Aintree, made a total of over a
thousand tons a week. Storage was provided for from 5,000,000 to 6,000,000
jars. It was opened on June 25, 1901.</p>

<p>It was a great venture of faith. The cost was naturally enormous and for
several years no profit at all was made. On this I may quote a letter he wrote
to Mr. Meakin, a Primitive Methodist minister in London on January 12,
1905.</p>

<blockquote>"Yours of the 6th has had much more than usual consideration. We
have made no money in London yet. Our works are very large and the cost of the
freehold site and of the works plant, stock and working capital, together with
the excessive rates and taxes in London, make it difficult to make any profit
for a while. We shall make some profit I hope after another year or two,
because we are gradually getting the ear of the London buyers, who will in time
know the fine quality of our stuff.<br>
<br>
 "After what I have said you will feel that I cannot help London work as I
would like, but it will be a pleasure to me to give the last &pound;100 of the
present debt on the mission premises.<br>
<br>
 "I wish your work every success."</blockquote>

<p>As this letter anticipated, the venture of faith was soon justified and the
business having established its reputation in the South moved forward at
ever-accelerating speed.</p>

<p>From this general statement about the buildings I pass on to the process of
manufacture, reserving some points for special mention in connexion with the
treatment of the workpeople. Believing that the people would rapidly appreciate
real excellence, he set before himself from the first the highest standard of
quality. In a letter he wrote to a correspondent in 1906 he said:</p>

<blockquote>"I trust that I may be pardoned for saying that in my own business
I have tried for forty years to make the best possible article, and to turn it
out in the best style, believing that high-class quality will not only bring
reputation, but dividend, and it is on this basis that I venture to make my
suggestion."</blockquote>

<p>He kept a vigilant eye on the quality of the materials. When the London
works were opened he gave a description of the materials employed, in which he
said: "Our preserves and marmalade are all made direct from the fresh fruit,
some of which we grow on our own farms; the remainder is either grown specially
for us or carefully selected from the London markets. All the raspberries and
strawberries we use are English; we never have any foreign whatever. This is
not a recent decision, but has been our invariable practice for thirty years.
The fruit is generally gathered and preserved on the same day, and filled
direct into the stoneware jars where it remains intact without further
disturbance until it is actually consumed. Perhaps I ought to say that all the
preserves and marmalade made at these works will be from fresh fruit and lump
sugar and no other ingredient whatever. We do not use glass jars because our
method is to fill the jam into the jars immediately it is boiled, so that glass
jars would not stand the heat without constant breakages and most serious risk
of pieces of broken glass getting into the jam, therefore for twenty years we
have practically used only the highly glazed stoneware jars."</p>

<p>When the fruit was unloaded at the private railway siding it had to be
cleaned. Mr. Hartley was specially interested in machines for cleaning fruit,
and I can testify to their efficiency from actual observation. The fruit was
then placed in large pans and boiled by steam. The steam was drawn away by
electric fans, working at 650 revolutions a minute. The pans were suspended on
sockets and were therefore easy to tilt when the jam was ready to be poured
out. It was then poured into copper-lined troughs and wheeled away to be
transferred to the pots, which, after an effective cleansing, were invariably
inverted until the time came for them to be used. When filled they were taken
to the warehouse. In July, 1906, three eminent physicians inspected the whole
process of manufacture and made this report.</p>

<blockquote>"We are pleased to testify that we have gone through the whole
building and watched the processes of manufacture from beginning to end, and I
must say that we are exceedingly well pleased with the entire arrangements. The
fruit was most excellent; its condition could not have been better, and
everything used in the manufacture of the jam was all that we could desire. We
were very much impressed with the sanitary arrangements and the perfect system
of ventilation which you have here. Everything was clean and fresh, the workers
were neat and tidy, and your whole system, apparently, is so devised that there
is the minimum handling of the fruit. Another point which occurred to us was
the thoroughness with which the fruit is preserved. The great boiling heat in
those cauldrons which we saw would sterilize anything. It would be impossible
for anything to come out of the pans which was not perfectly sterile after
being subjected to that fierce heat."</blockquote>

<p>It will be observed that the whole process was completed without delay. It
is not unusual in the manufacture of jam for the fruit to be turned into pulp
and kept in that state for a considerable time. The reason for this is that the
rush of fruit is so great (the strawberry season, for example, lasts three
weeks), that all attention is paid to the preserving of it, the subsequent
stages being postponed till the workpeople can be spared to complete them. The
disadvantage of this is that fermentation may set in and preservatives are
accordingly introduced. On the method which was followed in Mr. Hartley's
factories the fruit was potted with all its valuable qualities intact and
fermentation could not be set up. Moreover, nothing but fresh fruit and sugar
was used.</p>

<p>In this connexion attention may be called to a letter he wrote on August 7,
1906, to the Right Hon. John Burns, who was at the time in charge of the
Government department concerned, in which he said:</p>

<blockquote>"I am satisfied that all the high-class jam manufacturers, the
entire body of public analysts, together with over 95 per cent. of the medical
profession are earnestly desirous that these recommendations should be passed
into Law.<br>
<br>


<p>"As the Law now stands jam manufacturers who make the best possible article,
without any preservative, are much handicapped by the competition of inferior
houses who still continue to use salicylic acid. There should be a common basis
for all manufacturers.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>"The use of salicylic acid is prohibited in America and I believe in several
continental countries, and I think it ought to be either allowed by Law and the
quantity limited and defined, with its presence named upon the label, or it
should be absolutely prohibited."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In accordance with his principle of examining everything himself, not only
did he exercise careful supervision over the quality of the fruit and the sugar
and the process of preserving, but on the day after the fruit had been boiled
he personally tested every sample of every boiling of jam. He would be at the
factory at six in the morning and often examined a thousand jars. Nine jars
were placed on a stand at a time and brought to him. He touched the paper
covering of each in order to test the consistency of the jam. His great
delicacy of touch was a valuable asset. This occupied an hour and a half,
during which he was standing most of the time. The result of his examination
would determine his policy for the day and the formula used. In this way the
boilers started right at seven o'clock. More scientific methods have since been
introduced. As illustrating his care of the fruit, it may be added that flags
were used in place of concrete wherever fruit had to be stored. The regulation
in the factories is that all fruit, if it has to be stored, even if only for a
few hours, has to be placed on flags, not concrete. The Aintree manager, Mr.
Rigsby, tells me that he has tested the matter for himself with oranges and
found that it makes 25 per cent. difference in value in a week according as
they are stored on concrete or flags, the reason being the natural porosity of
stone as against concrete. The regulation suggests that Mr. Hartley must have
been struck by the fact that the old people always kept milk on flags and was
thus led to adopt the practice.</p>

<p>The quality of the product itself may be indicated by reference to an
editorial article in <i>Science Siftings</i>. It contains an analysis of the
jam and the editor adds: "Both the bottled fruit and the jams under the most
rigorous scrutiny proved to be equally beyond reproach."</p>

<p>There was no detail in connexion either with the business or the workers
that he was not himself fully-prepared to discuss, and he expected his managers
and his secretaries to be equally ready.</p>

<p>The correspondence was naturally very large, and he was usually free for
letters after breakfast. The letters were arranged in a certain order--the
business letters first and the more important of these on the top. He dictated
his replies, and while he was not naturally a ready public speaker he had
remarkable facility in dictation. His language was good and his thought
unfolded in regular form. He never took a holiday, except it was on the
Continent, without being accompanied by a secretary for purposes of the
business. Towards the end of the last century he had an attack of rheumatic
fever in the South of France and, to the vexation of the doctor, his
confidential secretary used to go to his bedroom for work. Although he was so
ill and suffering so acutely he issued his own bulletin.</p>

<p>As the business grew to enormous proportions much care had to be taken in
the financing of it. As he was far too good a business man to leave a large
amount of capital standing idle so that it might be ready for use in the
business season, it was necessary for him to have a very large overdraft at the
bank during this period of the year, which would be reduced till it was wiped
out as the payments for his goods came in. Of course when new works or
warehouses were erected the capital expenditure was enormous and might involve
a prolonged overdraft. For example, there is an interesting entry in a diary on
January 27, 1890, to the effect that his banking account was that day in credit
and he had given notice that he should not require any overdraft for some time
to come, if at all. Then he adds: "I have been looking forward to this day for
3-1/2 years since I built the Aintree works, and am much pleased to see it." A
letter he wrote on September 15, 1903, two years after the London works were
opened, may be quoted appropriately at this point:</p>

<blockquote>"I regret that I cannot send you any more money as I owe my bankers
to-day &pound;106,000. My business in Liverpool and London is very large and
takes an enormous sum of money. I consecrate a definite and liberal portion of
my total income for Christlike work and use the money as a steward, and
although I owe my bankers &pound;106,000 I need not owe them that large sum if
I was content with a smaller business, or if I had not built the new works in
London, and I cannot allow humanitarian work to suffer until I pay the bank
off. I must serve the Lord every day to the best of my ability."</blockquote>

<p>I must touch elsewhere on the difficulties created by the war and conditions
after the war, but I may quote at this point from a letter he wrote to me on
March 23, 1920.</p>

<blockquote>"Money is very scarce, and the Banks are very tight and have more
or less considerable objection to lend money even for good business purposes,
and now that sugar, fruit and everything we use is three or four times as dear
as it was in pre-war times, it takes an immense amount of extra capital, many
hundreds of thousands to work the business."</blockquote>

<h2><a name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3><i>The Employer and his Workpeople</i></h3>

<p>The reputation of an employer of labour largely stands or falls with his
treatment of those whom he employs. No munificent gifts to the Churches, no
lavish expenditure on philanthropy, can atone for failure here. It is therefore
vital to ascertain how Mr. Hartley stood this test. Our answer may start from a
statement of his own. At a Young Men's Class a paper was read in which it was
stated that he paid wages to some of his female employees of such a character
that in order to make a living no option was left them but to lead immoral
lives, Mr. Hartley was naturally both distressed and indignant at a statement
so criminally reckless and so spitefully untrue. His reply was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"1. I pay from 20 per cent. to 40 per cent. more for female labour
than the general payment by my competitors or others in Liverpool and
neighbourhood.<br>
<br>
 "2. In July, 1903, I voluntarily increased the wages of all my workpeople both
male and female. I had not a single complaint from any person, but being
desirous to crush selfishness in some measure, I voluntarily increased the
wages, and this cost me at the rate of &pound;2,000 a year. This is the third
time that I have made a voluntary increase in the past ten or twelve years.<br>
<br>
 "3. I have practised profit-sharing for seventeen years. The total amount
distributed from the beginning up to last January was over &pound;37,000, and
all my people get a share of the profits, both men and women.<br>
<br>
 "4. I provide a fully qualified medical man who has resided in Aintree more
than ten years, to attend upon all my workpeople free. There is no club and no
charge is made. I pay the doctor an annual fee for his services.<br>
<br>
 "5. I have a large number of superior houses in the village with exceedingly
low rents, the largest proportion of them being 3s. 6d. and 4s. 6d. per week,
which includes rates, taxes and water.<br>
<br>
 "6. My reputation in Aintree and Liverpool as a generous employer is so great
that every year in July when our fruit season comes round we have such an
enormous number of women desiring to work for us, a thousand or more, that
every year we have to employ a county police officer for several weeks to keep
order, so great is the desire of the women to work for us, a large number of
whom make application season after season. This shows that the women are well
pleased with the conditions of their employment."</blockquote>

<p>The gravity of the gross accusation to which Mr. Hartley made so complete
and so crushing a reply was enhanced by the fact that owing to the character of
the business the preponderance of female over male labour was so enormous.
Profit-sharing must receive separate attention. But some of the other points
mentioned in his reply will bear further elucidation; and in addition special
attention must be directed to the conditions under which the work of the
factory was done.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="il-4"></a><img alt="" src="0701091h-images/0701091h-04.jpg"></p>
</center>

<p>As in other cases, so in his relations with his work people, his conduct was
controlled by the Golden Rule. Speaking to an interviewer in 1898, he said: "I
have always had the happiest relations with my people. If you ask me how it is
to be accounted for, I can only say that it has been my aim from the first to
do to them as I would wish to be done by. Three times within recent years the
wages have been advanced unasked, and the last advance cost me &pound;1,400 a
year."</p>

<p>He felt that their interests were identical with his own and that they had a
claim to share in the prosperity of the business. He was constantly on the
alert to devise schemes for their welfare and to make the conditions of their
work easier. One of his favourite maxims was that the work should be made
attractive to the worker. In view of the great preponderance of female labour,
the number of women and girls being in proportion to the men and boys as four
to one, it was natural that special attention should be paid to the lightening
of physical strain. If a piece of work seemed to be at all difficult he would
say: "What can be done to take the hardness out of this job? Never mind the
cost." Many hundreds of pounds were frequently spent in saving labour, when the
expenditure brought no financial return. His altruistic policy was expressed in
the pithy maxim, "Leave the money in the bones of the worker." Graduated slopes
with very easy gradients were provided for the girls to push the trucks of
which there are 800 in the Aintree factory. Miniature tram lines were laid down
to facilitate the work. There are six miles of these tram lines in the factory
and one mile in the new warehouse. On one occasion some tram trucks were sent
and were found to be unduly heavy. He saw them work, he tried them himself and
said, "Scrap them." In the specification for the new trucks roller bearings
were ordered to make them run as easily as possible. Nor did the work of the
men go without similar attention. In the early days the wheeling of the sugar
was an arduous task; now in both factories ingenious machinery has been
installed to save this labour. After the opening of the London works the
<i>Croydon Chronicle</i> made a comment which may be fitly quoted here.</p>

<blockquote>"Of course the requirements of modern life are such that a great
deal of work has to be done by machinery; but, to the credit of Mr. Hartley be
it said, he has seen that his men have become the masters of the machines
instead of their slaves, and thus has made of industrialism a blessing and not,
what it is in many cases, an unmitigated curse."</blockquote>

<p>The best proof of the excellence of the conditions under which the women and
girls work was afforded by an inspection carried through by women who would
have been very competent to detect any oppressive treatment or unduly severe
conditions of labour. Miss Gertrude Tuckwell, who was at the time honorary
secretary of the Industrial Law Committee, lectured in Liverpool on sweating
and insanitary workrooms. She had specially in mind certain small London
laundries, but as she mentioned jam factories and the lecture was delivered in
Liverpool, Mr. Hartley felt it necessary to take up the matter. He invited Mrs.
Allan Bright, who presided at the lecture, to inspect the Aintree works,
accompanied by Miss Tuckwell or anyone else, and assured them that they would
have the opportunity of asking any questions they wished from any of the female
workers. As Miss Tuckwell had then left for a visit to Spain, Mrs. Bright was
accompanied by Miss Forman. They thoroughly inspected all the female workrooms.
They watched the various processes in actual operation, they stepped into the
pits in which the girls stand when they are filling the jam pots to save
stooping and to relieve the feet from fatigue. They cross-questioned the women
and girls in the works and at the surgery. They explored the village with its
model dwellings and its bowling green, and carefully examined a cottage, the
weekly rental of which with rates, taxes and water was only 2s. 6d. Mrs.
Bright's own statement at the close of the inspection may be given in her own
words: "With regard to Mr. Hartley's factory, everything here is most perfect.
I regret that the factory is not still larger so that even more hands could be
employed under such excellent sanitary conditions. Miss Forman and I asked the
many women and girls with whom we conversed whether there were any fines, and
we were informed, in every case, that no fines were known. One woman, with
nearly twenty years' service, said she had never heard of any such thing as
fines at this factory. We asked the patients at the surgery, and they replied
to the same effect. We did not see any ground for supposing that there is heavy
weight-lifting by females. The ventilation of the factory is admirable. We saw
the electric fans working, and were struck with the extremely effective
ventilation and the drawing off of the steam."</p>

<p>On several occasions Mr. Hartley took the opportunity afforded by his
address at the Profit-Sharing to encourage his workpeople to come to him if
they were in any trouble--"and undoubtedly," he said, "many are often in
distress from various causes"--and he would always be pleased to do his best to
help them. But he made the qualification that he would not on any consideration
help anyone who spent his money in drink, because he had no sympathy with drink
in any shape or form. The plan which he adopted for allocating the money to be
distributed at the Profit-Sharing necessitated personal knowledge of the
workers. His own words are worth quoting on this point: "This means that I must
be in personal touch with practically every one of my workpeople, and I am sure
it works well. They all feel that they are not lost in the size of the business
but are in direct contact with me, and they like this, while, of course, it
stimulates them to do their best. There is nothing like it for cementing good
feeling between employer and employed, and I really think it would be better
for both parties if the system were generally adopted."</p>

<p>In this connexion it may be added that a Benevolent Fund was started at the
works and it was managed by a committee elected by those employed in the
business. On one occasion (May 21, 1894) Mr. Hartley placed &pound;1,000 to the
credit of this fund. In addition to the engagement of a doctor to attend upon
all the workpeople free he also provided a trained nurse for the same purpose.
One year he took all his employees who were over eighteen years of age for a
five days' trip to the Glasgow Exhibition and a long sail to the Isle of Arran.
He paid them their full wages during the holiday and defrayed their travelling,
hotel and exhibition expenses.</p>

<p>At the opening of the year 1909 Sir William announced at the annual
profit-sharing an important new departure. He had for some years, he said, been
thinking of establishing a pension fund for his workpeople. He had long felt
that workers of good character who had rendered long and excellent service
ought to receive such recognition. He would have spoken to them on the subject
at least two or three years earlier but felt that he must wait until the
Government bill had been settled. He was now satisfied that this need not
interfere with the scheme he had in his mind but would on the contrary be of
assistance to it. His own earnest desire and endeavour would be so to shape it
that no deserving man or woman who had spent the best of his days in their
service and lived a consistent, respectable, and thrifty life need be worried
as to their means of livelihood in their declining days. No absolute age limit
would be fixed, but all would be eligible, both men and women, whether their
need arose from old age, accident or infirmity, provided they met the
conditions named. He desired them all to have savings of their own so far as
circumstances permitted and this would be considered no barrier to their
receiving a pension or reason for lessening the amount, but rather the reverse.
To give the pension fund what he considered to be a fair and moderate start he
had decided to transfer to it from that night the sum of &pound;5,000. No
contributions would be asked from the workpeople; it would therefore be free
from actuarial calculations; and since he proposed to contribute the whole
himself no complications could arise. When the &pound;5,000 was used up, the
fund would naturally come to an end; but there was at present no serious demand
upon it and in case of need both principal and interest could be exhausted, so
it would last for a considerable time. The administration would be in the hands
of trustees appointed by himself well-known to them and trusted by all. The
granting, withholding or continuing of pensions would be at their absolute
discretion. The trustees would act with him during his life and would continue
to act after his death. His view was that, speaking generally, workpeople
should contribute to a pension fund where such a fund was in existence; but he
had adopted a non-contributory scheme so as to avoid actuarial calculations. He
expressed the hope of increasing the sum in future years.</p>

<p>In 1910 he added &pound;500, and &pound;1,000 in 1911. At the profit-sharing
of 1915 the fund had been raised to &pound;11,119. At that gathering he
announced that he had executed a document putting the fund into legal form,
thus making it absolutely certain that, whatever happened, the money could be
used for pensions alone. In March, 1916, soon after he had celebrated his
seventieth birthday, he explained that when the War Loan was issued in July,
1915, he invested in it the sum at which the Pension Fund then stood,
&pound;11,200. On his seventieth birthday he decided to put this fund on a
satisfactory basis; he therefore transferred &pound;10,000 of his own War Loan
investment to the fund, which thus stood at &pound;21,200. He thought that he
would not have to pay anything more to it as he believed that it was now
adequate for all purposes. Moreover, he had transferred the whole of the amount
from his own name into the names of trustees. He pointed out that the money he
had contributed to the London and Liverpool hospitals, along with that given to
the Pension Fund, had exhausted the whole of his War Loan investment amounting
to &pound;30,000.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>Employers are now compelled to provide dining accommodation for workers who
cannot get home in the middle of the day. Here also Mr. Hartley was a pioneer.
He was one of the first, probably the first, to provide a dining-room for his
workers. The men and women have separate accommodation. The dining-hall for the
women measures 82 feet by 42 feet. The men's dining-room is naturally much
smaller; it measures 36 feet by 17 feet. In these rooms 750 can dine at once.
They are on the ground floor together with the stores, pantries, etc. The
provision for cooking, which includes a large bakery, is on a very elaborate
scale since, in the height of the season, 1,000 to 1,500 dinners have to be
prepared every day. As the rooms are in use for several hours in the day and
during this time 3,000 to 4,000 meals are served, the question of ventilation
is of great importance. Mr. Hartley wished the party that dined at one o'clock
to have the benefit of an atmosphere as good as the party that dined at twelve.
Immense trouble had been taken to secure the best system, and Mr. Hartley, in
company with the architect, visited a considerable number of buildings, so as
to secure not only the best general system but to avoid regrettable mistakes in
detail. The atmosphere can be renewed, if necessary, thirteen times in an hour,
and it is purified before it is forced into the rooms and warmed in cold
weather to whatever temperature is required. I was present when the dining-hall
was opened and had personal opportunity of observing the efficiency of the
system, and indeed have an entertaining recollection that some who were not
used to over-much fresh air found the system, if anything, too efficient. At
the close of the tea and the speeches Mr. Hartley announced that the
temperature of the room was only one degree higher than when the room was
empty. It was his desire that every thing in the cooking department should be
both nice and cheap. Accordingly, while all arrangements were made that the
food should be as well prepared as possible, the meals were provided at cost
price, since he would make no profit out of them. It should be added that
although this dining-room was erected several years after the Aintree works
were opened, Mr. Hartley had not waited so long before providing for the needs
of his work people. But the original dining-hall had proved too small and the
accommodation generally had been found insufficient.</p>

<p>Close to the works Mr. Hartley also erected a model village. Rental
including rates, taxes and water was from 2s. 6d. a week. A five-roomed cottage
was let for 3s. 6d. a week. He also built a number of better houses to be sold
at cost price to working men, who might include others than his own workpeople.
His method was to charge 3-3/4 per cent. on the amount of the purchase money
and for part of the principal to be paid off each month, the repayment being
complete within a period of twenty years. The purchaser could pay it off in a
shorter period if he so desired. So far back as his early Aintree period Mr.
Hartley was keenly interested in the question of housing which has now become
so acute. He had a very good opinion of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain's Housing Act
and made suggestions to him when it was being prepared. He wished that it could
be more generally adopted. The cottages for the workpeople were provided with
gardens, the streets were wide, there was a central bowling green and a field
for football and hockey. At the rear he preserved a passage of 12 feet. This
was a point in which he was interested when he was a member of the Liverpool
City Council. He fought strenuously to secure the improvement in the city
regulations by which a minimum passage of 9 feet was required.</p>

<p>His system of Profit-Sharing also illustrates his relations with his
workpeople, but it is best reserved for separate description. A further point,
however, should be mentioned here. One of the great difficulties which arose
out of the nature of the work was that of finding employment for the full
number of workpeople in the slack season when no fruit could be obtained. The
number of women and girls employed accordingly varied at Aintree from about 600
to 2,000. This was necessitated by the fact that the process of jam-making was
completed at one time and not, as in many factories, left incomplete in the
busy season for completion in the slack period. Marmalade, of course, could be
made in the winter, but here again the quality of the product determined the
date. He would have been willing to open his marmalade season some weeks before
Christmas but he felt compelled to adhere to the use of Seville oranges alone,
and as these are grown near the coast and on high ground the fruit did not
reach him till about December 20.</p>

<p>He maintained very cordial relations with his staff. He picked his own men
and trained them in his own methods. He would provide necessary technical
training also. Since Chemistry was an essential factor in the business he would
give a manager a full Chemistry course at his own expense. He exercised such an
attraction on members of his staff that it was a pleasure for them to do what
they could for him. He knew how to get the best out of every man. Once, after
an additional boiler had been built in thirteen weeks, he said to one of his
managers, "I want you a minute." To show his appreciation of the way in which
the work had been done he had some heaps of sovereigns on the table. He put one
of the heaps, containing &pound;50, into an envelope, handed it to the manager
and slipped away before he had the opportunity to thank him.</p>

<p>At the profit-sharing, January, 1910, he acknowledged a presentation given
to his wife and himself at Christmas, On his arrival home from the office on
Christmas Eve he found a large and beautiful silver table-centre accompanied by
an illuminated address. This read:</p>

<blockquote>"Dear Sir William and Lady Hartley,--<br>
<br>
 "The officials, travellers, office staff, and works' employees of the Aintree
establishment ask your acceptance of this piece of plate in acknowledgment of
much kindness received by them during many years, and unite in sending you and
your family the season's greetings, praying that you may have continued health
and prosperity.<br>
<br>
 "Aintree, <i>Christmas</i>, 1909."</blockquote>

<p>He expressed his own and Lady Hartley's appreciation of their kindness and
their admiration for the artistic design but, more than all, their thanks for
such a token of goodwill. He added that it was always a pleasure to do anything
he could for their welfare, and it was a source of much gratification to
himself and his family to know that for a number of years they had been able to
work together in that satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>A few words may be appropriately added at this point on his relation with
those from whom he purchased his fruit. His usual principle was to determine
the price himself after the fruit had been delivered. One grower who felt that
this was "not business" insisted on the price being fixed beforehand. Mr.
Hartley acquiesced; but the price was much less than he would have actually
given had the matter been left to his discretion. I remember how more than
thirty years ago a friend of my own was talking to a Herefordshire fruit grower
who supplied Mr. Hartley with strawberries. Quite unaware that my friend knew
something of Mr. Hartley in another connexion, he told him that he had such
confidence in him that he left the fixing of the price entirely to him and
found it altogether satisfactory. Another friend tells me that on one occasion
Mr. Hartley had engaged to purchase black currants at a fixed price. It turned
out that there was a great scarcity that season, but this man fortunately had a
very good crop. Mr. Hartley paid him the market price, which was far higher
than that which had been agreed upon.</p>

<p>A much more remarkable example has been communicated to me by the Rev. J. T.
Barkby. He was dining one night at the National Liberal Club with a number of
friends. Sir Henry Holloway said to him: "I heard a lovely story about your
father-in-law a little while ago. I was up in Scotland and was in the company
of a cultured gentleman who was a fruit farmer. I asked him what he did with
his fruit and he said, 'I send all of it to Sir William Hartley, and I shall
not send any to anyone else.' 'That is a great thing to say,' I replied. 'Yes,
and I mean it,' the farmer said, 'and if you had experienced at the hands of
another the kindness that Sir William has shown me, you would say the same.
Last season was a bad season. I had arranged with Sir William about the price
as usual and had sent on my stuff to him. Unfortunately the farms produced much
less than was expected. There was a shortage of fruit and the price went up, so
that I was losing heavily. Without my saying a word to Sir William I one day
received a letter from him in which he said, "I am sure you must be losing
money on the fruit you are sending to me; tell me frankly the position." I
wrote and acknowledged the receipt of his letter saying how good he was to me
and at the same time laying before him the facts of the situation. He replied,
saying how sorry he was for me, and quite spontaneously sent on a cheque for a
large sum of money to help to cover my deficiency. Do you wonder that I say
what I do in relation to sending to Sir William?'" Mr. Barkby tells me that he
believes the cheque sent by Sir William was for some thousands of pounds. He
wrote to Sir William, thinking that the story would cheer him in his illness,
but the letter reached his house on the morning of the day on which he had
passed away.</p>

<p>Although it is not strictly relevant to our present topic this may be the
most convenient place in which to relate a similar incident which Mr. Barkby
has communicated to me. In conjunction with Mr. John Bunting, Sir William had
purchased several mills in Oldham. These mills had been partially erected in
the time of prosperity by some who were engaged in different businesses, for
example as machine-makers, engineers, boiler-makers, with a view to getting
business and furnishing the mills with such things as they made. They took part
of the cost of things in shares, only partially paid up. Trade became bad; they
were unable to finish the mills and were called upon to pay up much of their
share capital. Some of them were unable to do this and had to compound with
their creditors. Sir William and Mr. Bunting acquired the mills at a public
auction. Trade improved and the mills made money. Sir William said to Mr.
Barkby that he felt it was not right for him to be making money out of these
mills while some of the men who had built them had lost their all. One week he
sent for one of the men, a boiler-maker or engineer, who came with not the
slightest idea of Sir William's reason in sending for him. Sir William told him
that he did not feel that he could pocket all this money out of the mills
whilst his visitor had lost so much. To his bewilderment and overwhelming
gratitude Sir William gave him a cheque for a thousand pounds. Mr. Barkby adds
that he believes that some time later Sir William gave him another thousand
pounds. He says that these incidents are only typical of what Sir William was
doing for many years. I am glad to have the opportunity of relating them--they
were quite unknown to me--since Mr. Barkby as Sir William's son-in-law and his
minister in Southport for twelve years had exceptional opportunities of knowing
what the giver himself would have been the last to publish abroad.</p>

<p>Sir William once told me that some of his foreign growers had suffered
heavily owing to some natural catastrophe and that he was sending them a
considerable sum of money to alleviate their disaster. And it is worth while to
quote a letter which he sent to me in 1907 which is incidentally a striking
revelation of the man. The condition of things described created great
difficulties for himself, but it is not on these that he dwells. He wrote.</p>

<blockquote>"Up to the present we have had a most anxious and pessimistic
season and all my strawberry growers are exceedingly depressed. The
strawberries are there, but the sun is not there, therefore they only ripen at
about one-sixth the usual speed, and in a word the weather is so cold, wet and
sunless, that the strawberry crop is now certain to be well below the
average--indeed only the very best of the fruit can survive the weather
conditions. Unless there is an almost immediate change in the weather the crop
will be nearly ruined, which means that my growers can hardly survive the
financial shock. I name all this to show the great difficulties under which my
strawberry growers are working; in a word, every heart knows its own
bitterness."</blockquote>

<p>I have left to the last perhaps the most crucial of all the tests, the rate
of wages. On this it will be enough, in addition to what has been already said,
to select two of his utterances, each delivered on the occasion of his
profit-sharing. Speaking at the close of 1897 he pointed out that most of his
workpeople were engaged in ordinary unskilled duties. He had always paid the
full rate of wages current in Liverpool, and indeed much more, as he had
voluntarily advanced the rate of wages, especially for women, during the last
seven years. The last advance which had been made on June 22, the day of Queen
Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, had cost &pound;1,400 a year. Such was his desire
for his workpeople to be properly paid that if it could be shown to him that in
any department of his works his wages were not as high or higher than in the
works of his Liverpool competitors, he would not only be willing, but pleased,
to increase such wages immediately.</p>

<p>Speaking at the London profit-sharing fourteen years later, in January,
1912, he said:</p>

<blockquote>"We have also gone carefully over the duties and the wages of each
person in our employ. After considering the merit and the work of each of you
we have decided to voluntarily advance the wages of 277 of our work people. It
is not only our duty, but it is a real pleasure to endeavour to crush
selfishness and to voluntarily advance your wages without being asked to do so.
The advance includes most of the permanent day workers, and we have endeavoured
to do justice to you all. We have desired especially to watch the interests of
our women workers. We looked into your wages carefully at the last
profit-sharing, so that the advance you will receive at the next pay day will
be over and above the increases that were made a year ago."</blockquote>

<h3><i>Profit-Sharing</i></h3>

<p>Among the best-known features of Mr. Hartley's business was his system of
profit-sharing. He saw the account of a Frenchman who had adopted the system,
and this first set him thinking on the subject. But in his own opinion he would
never have adopted the practice but for the training he had given himself in
systematic and proportionate giving. The Rev. George Trusler has told me that
he said to him that the greatest battle of the kind which he had fought turned
on the question whether he should introduce profit-sharing into his business.
He added: "No one asked for it, no one expected it, no one had a claim upon it,
it might be resented by some in the trade. I paid a little more than others for
the work done, but I felt it my duty and privilege and shall continue to do
it."</p>

<p>Before I describe his method it will be well to indicate his views on
co-partnership. He dealt with the subject most fully in an address he delivered
in 1921.</p>

<blockquote>Co-partnership, he said, was an excellent idea. It was strongly
recommended by thousands of the best people in the country. Theoretically it
was perfect. He was afraid, however, it would not work out so well in their
special case. He had given much thought to it, and his view was that if there
was co-partnership between his workpeople and himself it would be worse for the
workpeople. He did not think there was a single man or woman in his employ who
would get the same financial benefit under co-partnership as they now did in
their present liberal system of profit-sharing. Suppose he invited his people
to invest their savings in the Aintree business, he did not believe that the
most thrifty, the most economical, and the most saving among them could invest
as much money as would bring them in more than half the amount in dividends as
they now got in profit-sharing, because the total capital required would be so
very large compared with the small amount that each of their workpeople would
be able to put in. Even at the best in their case, there could only be a
limited co-partnership because of the extra casual labour unfortunately needed
in each fruit season. In addition to these there was the large preponderance of
female workers, a large number of whom could not stay long enough in their
employ to enter upon a co-partnership scheme. At the same time he repeated that
there was nothing but good to be said about co-partnership between masters and
men, and he hoped it would spread far and wide.</blockquote>

<p>In the same speech he quoted with warm approval what Sir Christopher Furness
said to the shipbuilders in his employ when he offered them co-partnership. In
this the speaker dwelt on the true conception of partnership and the principles
he expounded were warmly endorsed by Sir William.</p>

<p>A quotation of what he said to a journalist in January, 1909, will show that
his views at this date were identical with those he expressed twelve years
later.</p>

<blockquote>"Theoretically co-partnership is best, but in practice I do not
think I am exaggerating when I say that it would not work out anything like so
well for the employee as my system. Not even the most thrifty could save enough
money to put into the business to bring them in as dividend what they now get
as their share of the profits. As it works out, of course, my method is a sort
of co-partnership, only the capital the employee puts in is not money but
energy, and he gets rewarded according to the amount of energy he
invests."</blockquote>

<p>He was quite ready to admit that his method might not be universally
suitable. When the question was put to him whether it would be possible to
follow it in other business concerns he replied: "That is a difficult question
to answer. I understand my own business, but cannot pretend to be as well
acquainted with other people's. The system I adopt could not be applied in
every case; but the principle should be capable of application in most business
concerns. The spirit of profit-sharing is to my mind the great thing."</p>

<center>
<p><a name="il-5"></a><img alt="" src="0701091h-images/0701091h-05.jpg"></p>
</center>

<p>He dissented from the practice which was adopted by most firms which
practised profit-sharing. Nearly all of them reserved one-half or two-thirds of
the money, if not the whole, and invested it either in a bank or in the firm
itself or in some other way so that it might be useful to the owners in time of
need. He had considered the matter from time to time and always reached the
conclusion that it was better to give the money at once to the workers and
depend upon their discretion for making the best use of it. He lamented,
however, that so few firms adopted the system. He had many inquiries from other
employers of labour requesting him to furnish particulars on the subject.
Almost invariably the question was asked if profit-sharing paid. His reply was
always that he did not look closely into that, but it was evident that if the
profit was less then the profit-sharing would also be less. He simply asked
himself was it right, was he doing as he would like to be done by. Having
settled this, he began it and continued it. It is perhaps no cause for surprise
that the correspondence usually terminated at this point. In an interview he
gave in 1898 he said: "Profit-sharing is over and above a fair and just wage,
and is given, not because I think it pays commercially--for I never ask myself
that question--but because it seems to me right and doing as I would be done
by." Ten years later he expressed himself much more definitely on this point.
In reply to a representative of the <i>Westminster Gazette</i> he said that the
system had justified all his hopes. He added: "Some twenty years ago I had to
take the idea entirely upon trust, but since then it has proved such a success
that I may say now that I believe it to be in all respects commercially sound
and humanitarian."</p>

<p>He always drew a sharp distinction between profit-sharing and the payment of
wages. It was natural that the people who reveal their own characters in the
maxim that there is no such thing as disinterested generosity and assume that
wherever it seems to be displayed there must be a trick somewhere, asserted
that what was distributed at the profit-sharing had previously been saved out
of wages. It has already been shown that this was entirely untrue, that the
standard rate of wages was not only maintained but exceeded, and that voluntary
advances had again and again been made. There was no legal claim to any share
in the profits nor any business tradition or convention to create a legitimate
expectation. His conviction from the outset of his career had been that the
interests of employer and employed were mutual and not antagonistic. Of this
profit-sharing was an expression. He said on one of the occasions when the
money was distributed: "I cannot carry on the business without your
co-operation, and I venture to think that in my capacity as your employer I
render some service to you. Whatever pleasure it gives you to receive the
profit-sharing, I can say with perfect sincerity that it gives me equal
pleasure to hand it to you."</p>

<p>His method was as follows. After each yearly stocktaking he set aside the
sum to be allocated for the purpose. The proportion of the total profit given
to the workpeople steadily increased as his ideas broadened; so that, as he
said at the profit-sharing in 1897, an amount which would have been impossible
at the first had now become comparatively easy. The simplest and most obvious
method would have been to base the amount paid to individuals upon the wages
that they earned. The whole matter could then have been one of calculation to
be carried through by the clerks. The method actually adopted was far more
laborious and it cost the management, and above all, the head of the business,
prolonged and anxious consideration. In the individual allocation the amount of
wages received was, of course, taken into account. But it was modified by the
principle that those should receive the largest share who in his opinion had
put the most thought, heart, and conscience into their work. This, of course,
involved constant observation throughout the year and delicate discrimination.
He conferred with the heads of departments on the case of each individual. When
he had secured their opinion as to the amount of energy and interest displayed
he went over the names himself. And that not once only but several times. Not
only did he go personally into every individual case but he entered every
amount in his own hand. I may at this point quote two letters. On January 8,
1906, he said in a letter to the Rev. R. Blair: "I was tired yesterday and I am
tired this morning, and on Saturday I could not bear to get up until five
o'clock, and I was dictating my letters in bed across at Inglewood. Last week I
had long and anxious work preparing for the profit-sharing, which takes a great
deal to do; to go through all the names of our people and allot to each with
accuracy and almost religious strictness the amount is really too big a job for
me in addition to my ordinary daily duties."</p>

<p>The other letter he sent to me on March 28, 1919, explaining that he could
not attend a meeting of the Methodist Union Committee on that day. It should be
remembered that Sir William had completed his seventy-third year at this
time.</p>

<blockquote>"It is my thirtieth Annual Profit-sharing on Saturday next, and I
could not possibly attend the Committee and also prepare the profit-sharing
details, which is a very big job for me. Having the claims of about 800 persons
to assess personally it takes hours and days of work to do it."</blockquote>

<p>Exacting though the work was from the first, it was greatly increased when
the London business had sufficiently developed to make a profit and justify a
profit-sharing. Precisely the same method was followed here as at Aintree,
though naturally he had not the opportunity of constant observation such as he
enjoyed at Aintree. He felt that his method had the advantage that it involved
personal contact between the employer and the employed which helped the
workpeople to feel that they were counted as personalities in whom a human
interest was taken and not as mere parts of a complex inhuman machine.</p>

<p>The annual profit-sharing was always an interesting occasion. The
distribution was naturally the core of the proceedings; but music was always
provided and there were speeches. The Chairman was often a man eminent in civic
or national life whose speech was worthy of the occasion. The speech delivered
by the head of the business was always an interesting feature of the ceremony.
Something would be said in it of the system itself, the motives behind it, its
influence in cementing friendly relations between employer and employed. He
would urge the recipients to use the money wisely, sometimes putting in a plea
that none of it should be spent on intoxicants or used for gambling. He would
announce new developments which affected the interests of the workpeople.
Occasionally he would offer his opinion on larger issues. Frequently he would
express the conviction that even if voluntary profit-sharing was not a solution
for all labour problems, the spirit of it would put an end to the conflicts
between labour and capital. Nor would he shrink from touching on the religious
root of his attitude and conduct in this matter. I may illustrate this from his
address at the profit-sharing of December, 1894.</p>

<blockquote>"I do not say that voluntary profit-sharing such as you will see
to-day is a solution for all labour problems, neither do I claim for myself any
special credit. I simply try in some measure to carry out the teaching of Jesus
Christ. This much I perhaps may be allowed to say, that, if any persons are
inclined to criticize my plan adversely, I would ask them to give it a trial in
their own business and with their own employees; and they will find that by the
time that they have reached the point of distributing the money they will have
had hundreds of struggles with their natural selfishness."</blockquote>

<p>He would also urge the recipients to put what energy they could into the
business. Speaking at the London profit-sharing in January, 1912, he said: "I
earnestly appeal to every one of you who receive profit-sharing to-day to put
your whole heart into the business. There is no doubt that every one of us can
put some initiative and originality into our work and in that way do something
to help to make a profit. This will react on the profit-sharing from year to
year. It took some years for our excellent quality to become known. The London
public now know and appreciate our goods."</p>

<p>At the Aintree profit-sharing he said: "We have now reached our thirtieth
distribution and can claim that profit-sharing has worked well with us. Our
interests are mutual; I cannot get on without your assistance and I trust that
I render some service to you. I want to appeal to you to do your best in the
business interest. Be punctual at your work, and see that there is no waste of
time or material either on your own part or on the part of others. Don't need
supervision, but use your best efforts to make a profit. We have great
competition and very properly the house that makes the best article at the most
reasonable price should win. I want us to be that house. I rely on your
co-operation."</p>

<p>Sir Edward Russell, the editor of the <i>Liverpool Daily Post</i>, more than
once took the chair, and it will be fitting to add an extract from his speech
at the gathering in January, 1912.</p>

<blockquote>That profit-sharing alone--if they regarded the figures of it--was
a great climax of generosity, and a continued climax of generosity from year to
year. There was again the pension fund, which seemed to be Sir William's
proposition, entirely generous on his part, and without doubt a great
benefaction to their particular community. Then they were reminded of their own
obligations to the community in which they lived by the gifts they made to the
hospitals. Sir William had told them that the spirit of that profit-sharing was
the absolute cure for labour evils. That he entirely agreed with. It was a
spirit of mutual understanding. It was the spirit of each party placing itself
in such a position as to take the point of view of the other.</blockquote>

<p>It only remains to state that the total amount distributed in
profit-sharings at Aintree and London up to the time of Sir William's death was
&pound;145,000. In the three years which have passed since his death an
additional &pound;27,000 has been distributed, making a total of &pound;172,000
up to the end of 1924.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3><i>Systematic and Proportionate Giving</i></h3>

<p>The root of Mr. Hartley's amazing career of philanthropy and support of
Christian work was found by himself in the vow made on New Year's Day, 1877, to
which reference has already been made. When the proportion was determined, that
amount of his gross income was set apart, as he once put it, not in his head
but in his books. He spoke on the subject again and again, and in view of the
place it filled in his thought and the controlling influence it had in his life
I have thought it well to quote his own utterances with exceptional fullness.
But I may first summarize the grounds on which he based the necessity of
systematic and proportionate giving. Only so, he urged, can we really know what
we are giving and save ourselves from fond delusions as to our liberality. Many
people imagine themselves to be far more generous in their gifts than they
really are. For want of such a principle members of religious communions
normally give no more than is extracted from them by the financial machinery of
their Church. This method alone will enable us to solve successfully the grave
financial difficulties which constantly hamper our Church work. But its
reaction on character and religious experience is of the highest value. He felt
that business men in particular needed some avenue of escape from the whole
atmosphere of commercialism, and systematic giving provided it. It was the most
effective instrument for securing the victory of the higher over the lower
self. He said: "Nothing raises money to a higher plane and gives it a higher
interest than systematic giving. I sit on my money; I don't let it sit on me.
To distribute my money is a harder and more anxious task than making it." He
once said to me when he had experienced very heavy losses that he was not
troubled by them. "No one holds his money with a lighter hand than I do." He
found in systematic giving the supreme means of grace, and believed that only
in this way could the deepest joy in co-operation with God be attained. He
never concealed from himself or from others the fact that his principle cost
him hard struggles. The gift for making money was not by any means easily
reconciled with the impulse to give it away. His commercial instincts would
have led him not only to create the wealth but to hold it fast. Speaking at the
end of 1897, with twenty-one years' experience of systematic giving behind him,
he said that it had taught him to regard money as a talent to be used in some
degree for the good of others--not as a beautiful theory only, but in the
actual business of life. To serve humanity as they should they ought to be
ready to give up some portion of what they would naturally like to keep. It was
not easy to do that. On the contrary, it was extremely difficult. The lower
self at once asserted its claim, and said, "I have it, and it is mine." But the
higher self, if it was in full sympathy with the teaching of Jesus Christ,
would rise above the temptation and be ready in some reasonable degree to share
with others. That spirit could only find ample scope with the greatest possible
determination. He once said: "If a man has crushed his own selfishness to any
considerable degree, he has had something to do."</p>

<p>The obstinate resistance of the selfish nature he insisted upon many times.
But as a practical man he recognized that the acceptance, once for all, of a
guiding and inflexible principle protected him from the wear and tear of
constant debate as each new appeal was made to his generosity. On this point he
said: "If a man has to have a fight with the devil over every half-crown or
five-pound note he gives away, he will often be worsted; he will imagine, too,
that he is giving far more than he really is.[*] With my system the struggle
only comes once a year and you know exactly where you are."</p>

<p>[*] Dr. J. H. Jowett made the same observation: "I have noticed that some
people assume they are very generous, but it is simply because they have no
system in their giving, and no record of their gifts."</p>

<p>But his experience was that the difficulty lessened as time went on.
Speaking, in 1898, of the consecration of a definite share of his income to
religious and philanthropic work he said: "This I conceive to be one of the
best checks to that natural selfishness which is inherent in human nature. The
man who resolutely carries out that principle will find that as he grows in
wealth his ideas broaden and his liberality increases. Personally I find it
easy comparatively to give a sum annually which would have been impossible to
me, even if the money had been at my command, twenty years ago. This practice
was to me a sort of moral education, a culture of conscience, and enabled me
some years later to adopt my principle of profit-sharing."</p>

<p>Somewhat earlier he said: "Every succeeding year my ideas have broadened, so
that what would have been impossible at first is now comparatively easy." What
he felt to be the underlying principle was confessed in these memorable words:
"The adoption of an enlightened policy is generally a gradual process, but the
more we cultivate the spirit of Jesus Christ, the easier the thing becomes; and
what appeared to us quite impossible at the beginning becomes not only possible
but absolutely a joy."</p>

<p>When he had occasion to speak of the unwillingness of wealthy people to help
good causes in a degree proportionate to their means, I have heard him quote
the maxim: "Much will have more." On May 14, 1903, when he was ill with
rheumatic gout, he wrote to Dr, F. B. Meyer who had asked him to help in
raising a fund, which he thought ought to have been raised by rich London Free
Churchmen. He told him that he felt very sad at the request, which should have
been unnecessary. He added: "The fact is that unless men begin to give the Lord
a share of what they get when they are comparatively young, the money becomes
their master, and they are no happier for it, but much more stingy and
miserable."</p>

<p>He held strongly that, as the income grew, the percentage of the money set
aside for religious and philanthropic purposes should be increased. He observed
with distress that the tendency was frequently in the other direction. If a man
gave &pound;40 out of an income of &pound;400 he was often inclined to feel
that to give &pound;400 out of &pound;4,000 would be very extravagant
generosity. This would be because he contrasted the gifts rather than the
capacity to pay and the amount left when the gifts had been subtracted. When
these considerations were put in the foreground it was obvious that a
percentage, which was adequate for a small income, might be quite inadequate
when the income had become much larger. He recognized, with rare humility, that
there were poor people who gave more than he did if measured by the qualitative
rather than the quantitative test. Few things touched him more deeply than the
sacrifices made by some of the very poor to help a worthy cause. His percentage
was altered several times during the course of his career, and always to a
higher level. Soon after I came to know him he told me that it was only a short
time since he had emerged from his earlier business difficulties and that he
had advanced cautiously in raising the percentage. He was anxious not to be
compelled to recede from the highest point he had previously attained.
Beginning with 10 per cent., he went forward by gradual stages till a third of
his gross income was set aside as "the Lord's money."</p>

<p>While the distribution of this money was the greatest joy of his life it
often cost him far more trouble and anxiety than the making of it. The number
of applications was enormous and since not a few were marked "Confidential" the
personal labour involved in dealing with them was greatly increased, especially
when they were badly written on flimsy paper and with poor ink. But much of the
correspondence dealt with trivial matters which ought never to have been
permitted to consume the time of so busy a man. Leaving these aside, there was
still a great mass of applications which deserved consideration. Many were
humanitarian in character and occasioned by sickness, bereavement, poverty or
disaster--distressing cases which appealed to his sympathies and merited his
help. Others were definitely religious or ecclesiastical--the erection of new
churches, reduction of Church debts, assistance to needy societies or circuits,
bazaars, forward movements, church institutes. Many of these applications arose
within his own denomination; but a great many also came from outside. In
dealing with these he had certain principles to guide him. He felt that places
with which he was specially associated had an exceptional claim upon him. His
birth-place, the towns in which he resided, health resorts that he visited, and
the towns and cities where the volume of his business was largest, all seemed
to him to have unusual claims. Similarly places with which members of his
family were connected made an appeal to him. Thus in a letter containing an
offer of help, addressed to Rev. J. S. Buckley (September 24, 1903), he said:
"In making this offer I do not of course forget that Penzance was one of the
circuits on which my late uncle, Rev. Robert Hartley, laboured." Then he
realized a peculiar duty to his own denomination. Most of the other
denominations were much wealthier and had a larger proportion of rich men. He
was in warm sympathy with their work and often helped them; but he felt that in
his own church the need was greater and the duty was more compelling.</p>

<p>In certain enterprises, especially those of great magnitude, he bore the
entire cost. But the appeals of the kind I have just enumerated were commonly
dealt with by the offer of a definite percentage, raised within a specified
time, which was in fact frequently extended, and with definite conditions
attached. He gave in such a way as to stimulate other people to give. If, for
example, a hundred pounds was needed he might offer 10 per cent. on all sums
raised up to the required amount, or he might offer to give the last ten pounds
if the sum was raised by a given date. And while he acted in this way with
appeals made to him, he frequently pursued the same policy with schemes he
himself initiated. He would draw attention to the need that some piece of
religious or philanthropic work should be done, and then make a challenge offer
on a large scale designed to elicit large donations in order that the total sum
might be reached. If he established any fund, he preferred to fix a time-limit.
For instance, when he founded the Hartley Lecture, which is delivered at the
Primitive Methodist Conference, he provided the sum required for a period of
ten years. This was in order that the experiment might be tried. Later he
extended the period but would not create a perpetual endowment. He wrote to the
General Committee Secretary, the Rev. W. Goodman, on April 20, 1896, saying: "I
have an objection to endowing anything in perpetuity, because I think future
generations should more or less provide for themselves." In some cases where a
new departure was desirable but it might have been difficult to get it started,
he would finance it himself entirely for a term of years and then the
responsibility would be taken over by the organization concerned. In this way,
for example, new tutorial appointments were made possible at Hartley College.
When large capital sums had been raised, his policy was that these, principal
and interest, should be exhausted within a certain period, and then the
responsibility of carrying on the work should be met by the creation of new
funds.</p>

<p>It was perhaps not unnatural, in view of his widely scattered and generous
gifts, that quite extravagant misconceptions were entertained as to the extent
to which help might be forthcoming for objects in which people were interested.
I was once approached with an inquiry as to the probability of his helping a
quite worthy cause and asked whether he might be willing to contribute
&pound;1,000. My answer was that I doubted whether he would contribute anything
at all; and thought that at the outside his gift would not be likely to be more
than &pound;25. There were hundreds of other causes which were equally worthy
and most of them likely to appeal to him more as in the line of his personal
duty. He gave princely sums for great and costly enterprises with far-reaching
possibilities of good. But over wide areas of Christian and humanitarian work
he had to choose either the alternative of helping a comparative few with
munificent gifts or that of spreading the money available over a great number
of cases. He was not carelessly generous. He had to do even-handed justice to a
multitude of competing claims. Excess in one case was bound to mean defect in
another. It must always be remembered that this was not a question of
generosity. The total amount to be distributed was fixed, it was the allocation
which remained to be determined; and if &pound; 1,000 was devoted to an object
for which &pound;25 would have been an average donation, it meant that this
particular cause was favoured at the cost of &pound;975 to some thirty-nine
others, all perhaps equally worthy. He was deeply annoyed when it was suggested
to him that he should contribute half of the total debt to an organization
which owed &pound;1,500. It seemed to him so extravagant that so much should be
asked for one object, which he was quite prepared to help in reason, but in
which he had no special interest and for which he felt no special
responsibility, that in speaking of it to me he said: "They must think that I
steal the money." No doubt many with a rather defective imagination were
sometimes disappointed that no more was given for their own particular
institution, when this could not have been done without injustice to
institutions with equal claims.</p>

</center>

<p>It was his custom to exercise careful discrimination and to investigate the
circumstances of each case. He had a vivid sense that the money when it had
been set apart, no longer belonged to himself; it was definitely "the Lord's
money" and he was simply a steward. He had accordingly to spend it with the
utmost care and to make it go as far as he could. All the keenness of his
business faculty was exercised on spending it to the best advantage. Hence
indiscriminate giving had to be avoided and impulsive giving had to be
regulated. In his later period he frequently did his best to secure that help
should be forthcoming from other interested quarters. In this way adequate
relief might be provided at perhaps half the cost to his fund which would have
been involved had he taken the whole responsibility, and thus the money saved
would enable more cases to be assisted. It should be added, however, that he
had trusted friends who were instructed to ask him for money required to help
deserving cases which came under their notice. The sum named was always given,
the only question asked was whether it would be enough for the purpose. Along
these secret channels money was constantly flowing in the relief of penury or
the alleviation of pain. It was stipulated that the names of those who were
helped should not be communicated to him and that his name should not be
disclosed to those who received the gifts.</p>

<p>He felt also that the actual giving was not enough; a man should attend to
the distribution himself. This involved far more than the gift of money. It
meant an exhausting tax on time and strength and personal service. The
consecration of personality preceded and perpetually underlay the consecration
of wealth. He especially deprecated the too common practice of holding
possessions fast till death and then leaving legacies for religious and
charitable purposes. He was so convinced that the personal distribution should
be inseparable from the gift, that he resolved to leave nothing for these
purposes in his will. In principle he adhered to this decision, but qualified
it by making provision not only for the fulfilment of all his promises but to
continue payment to institutions and causes to which he was a regular
contributor on a diminishing scale till the subscription expired.</p>

<p>It should be added that his principle as to the duty of giving was not
limited to money. In a speech delivered at Southport in the Cambridge Hall when
the question of old age pensions was before the country, he spoke in support of
it and also affirmed his belief in a graduated income-tax. He lifted the
matter, as was not unusual with him, above the level of party strife into the
atmosphere of great Christian principles. He said that the burden of the
country ought to be shared in such a way that those who had the most of this
world's goods should pay a larger proportion. Nay, he went further than this,
believing as he did, that the followers of Jesus Christ who had more endowments
of any kind whatever than their fellows, must not consider that those
endowments were for themselves alone, but were meant to be shared and must be
shared, in a reasonable and liberal manner, with others less endowed.</p>

<p>A more striking expression of the same principle was given by him when he
laid the foundation stone of the Cottage Hospital at Colne, on April 1, 1899.
Those who were endowed, he said, with wealth, knowledge and time, in any
measure over and above the average, owed a great debt to those who were less
endowed. The inequalities of human fate were best explained, and even rendered
tolerable only by the doctrine of election to service. The teaching of Jesus
Christ was that those who, by the inequality of human fate, turned up at the
top, owed a great debt, and by a portion of their money, knowledge and time,
they should redeem this debt for the benefit of those who were less
endowed.</p>

<p>At this point it will be best to quote his own words expounding and
enforcing the principle which lay so near his heart and was the secret of his
wonderful munificence. In his address as Vice-President of Conference he says:
"The greatest joy that can come to us is the privilege of being co-workers with
God; and in its truest and deepest sense we cannot know what this joy really is
until we have a fund consecrated to the service of Jesus Christ and give Him
His share with religious strictness and in proportion to all we get. Speaking
generally, the bulk of our people simply give what is drawn from them. We have
Sunday collections, class-meeting pence, special services, tea-meetings, pew
rents, and occasionally special efforts for mission and other objects. Our
whole system is based on constant appeals and this is the result of our almost
universal system of spasmodic giving. The bulk of us have not a concentrated
fund out of which we support our Church work; and there are many objects of
Christian activity in addition to the demands of our own Church."</p>

<p>In the same address, referring to his own practice of setting aside a
definite and increasing proportion for this purpose, he said: "This has not
been done without many a struggle with the devil and my lower self; and my
daily prayer is that God will show me what He wishes me to do. I only want to
see clearly His guiding hand, and I am daily asking Him to lead me. I see my
responsibility more and more; and I often picture what account we shall give at
the last if the Judge shall say that He was aware we had gone to Church, to the
class, to the prayer-meeting; but when it came to sacrificing our money to His
cause we let our lower self prove the master. This country spends 130 to 140
millions a year on intoxicating drinks. How much is the Christian Church
spending to evangelize the world? The distribution of the Lord's portion, which
I set apart, has been the greatest joy of my life, and a real means of grace
because it has kept me in constant touch with the promotion of Christ-like work
of all lands; and I am not going too far in saying that this personal contact
with the actual work has been quite as helpful to me in my Christian life and
more so than any other means of grace."</p>

<p>In his Presidential address to the Conference, June, 1909, he traced the
bearing of systematic giving on denominational problems. Pointing out that they
were for the most part financial questions he proceeded: "At present we are
held back in our medical missions, our foreign missions, our home missions, and
most of our aggressive enterprises for want of money. I am persuaded--and this
persuasion has grown out of a long personal experience--that all our financial
difficulties would soon disappear, and we should have money and to spare for
all such enterprises as those named and many other great projects, if only
every disciple of Jesus Christ willingly consecrated to the Master's service a
definite share of his income. Primitive Methodists who are now successful men
of business tell me confidentially that they cannot bring their mind to support
religious and philanthropic enterprises with the liberality they should, not
because they have not got the money, nor because they do not admit it to be
their duty, but because they have not sufficiently developed the disposition to
give. They did not start soon enough."</p>

<p>He did not limit his exposition of the great principle, of which he was so
ardent an evangelist, to religious assemblies. He referred to it briefly when
he was opening the Botanical Laboratory, which he presented to the University
of Liverpool in May, 1902, pointing out that his own practice afforded him an
outlet from the commercial into the distinctively Christian atmosphere. He
expressed the same conviction when he laid the foundation stone of new
buildings for the Liverpool workshops for the Outdoor Blind (1908). He said
that it had long been his conviction that a successful business man needed some
corrective, some safety-valve, some definite means of escape into the larger
life of the higher world; and he knew of nothing to compare in that regard with
the decision to devote to humanitarian work a definite and growing share of the
total income. The larger their income, the larger the proportion should be. It
was not what they gave but what they had left. When in 1909 he received the
Freedom of Colne he said: "I am very proud of my native town. If I am to judge
from my own experience, the pleasure of memory is much enhanced when, after the
lapse of years, one desires to share with his native town those fruits of
prosperity which may be made helpful to the many who in the fulness of life,
are less happily circumstanced. It is--so it seems to me, my friends--the
primary duty, the first duty of those who have money to remember in a liberal
manner those who have not, and so contribute to their needs as to make their
lives more worth living. It has been to my wife and myself the greatest joy of
our lives--that is saying a lot, but I feel it to be true--to devote a
definite, a well-considered, and a constantly increasing share of our total
income to the needs of mankind. As we have got better off, we have constantly
considered what was our further duty, and at least half a dozen times we have
considerably increased the percentage of our total income that we decided to
give for humanitarian work. Where much is given much is required."</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the fund was administered with all the care
which he devoted to his own commercial undertakings. He said, "I watch my
business to a penny"; and he was no less scrupulous and exact in his
stewardship of "the Lord's money." The percentage allocated from his total
income was entered in his books, so that there was no possibility of confusion
with his business or personal expenditure. The administration and distribution
of the fund were carried through with the same methodical care and punctilious
accuracy as in the case of his business. In a letter written on January 24,
1907, he said: "I always send out my charity cheques towards the end of January
in each year and not at varying dates during the year, but the whole lot in one
batch and on one day." For the greater part of his career much of the
correspondence and book-keeping involved was done at the works. There were
cases, however, in which he might secure the help of friends who were
interested in some special project. But in any case the tax on his own time and
strength was inevitably considerable owing to his resolute adhesion to his
principle of personal supervision. In 1908 he took a very important step in the
delegation of a measure of his responsibility. He invited the Rev. Thomas
Mitchell to leave London and come to Southport in order to devote his time to
this work. Dr. Mitchell was singularly fitted for this task. As a Primitive
Methodist minister of great experience and very wide knowledge of his
denomination, he had an exceptional equipment for dealing with a side of the
work which inevitably bulked largely in the selection of causes to be helped
and in the allocation of the amounts allotted. Dr. Mitchell had been President
of the Primitive Methodist Church, he had been the controller of its publishing
house and the financial secretary of the denomination. He had been associated
for a long time with its general administration and was thoroughly familiar
with its organization, its difficulties, the need of its institutions and its
Churches, the opportunities for expansion or extension of which advantage could
be taken. He had long been one of Sir William's advisers on matters relating to
the denomination. But he was also an active member of the Free Church Council
and shortly afterwards became its President. He was therefore well fitted to
co-operate in the promotion of interdenominational causes in which Sir William
took a deep interest. The Primitive Methodist Conference gave its sanction to
his acceptance of the invitation and his duty was to investigate applications
for help, recommend the policy to be adopted and undertake the necessary
correspondence. This could not in the case of Sir William involve transference
of the ultimate responsibility; and he still felt it his duty to give personal
attention to the applications for help. But it was of great advantage to have
the materials for decision collected, sifted and digested, and presented with
Dr. Mitchell's expert comment and advice. The relief from the burden of
correspondence was also very considerable, since Dr. Mitchell attended to this,
and it was not now necessary for Sir William to dictate the letters himself. On
the other hand, it perhaps had the effect of prolonging his working day,
because previously the correspondence relating to his charity fund had been
dealt with at the works, but now much time was given up in the evenings to his
discussions with Dr. Mitchell after his return home. Their association was
broken by the sudden death of Dr. Mitchell away from home, February 14, 1915.
He was succeeded by the Rev. J. S. White, a minister of long experience and
high character with a wide knowledge of the denomination. He also was taken
away by sudden death, on November 19, 1921.</p>

<p>The seed which Sir William scattered in season and out of season often
seemed to fall on reluctant and unresponsive ground. On this I cannot do better
than quote from a communication sent to me by the Rev. Joseph Ritson. He says:
"There were times when the apparently small results of his life-long propaganda
of systematic and proportionate giving depressed him--perhaps irritated and
amazed him would be a more correct way of putting it. What he saw so clearly
and felt so strongly surely ought to be seen and felt by others. If only the
Connexion would adopt his plan all its financial problems would be solved. The
slowness of even good men to adopt this method of mastering their natural
selfishness and the difficulty of rising superior to age-long custom he could
not understand or make adequate allowance for. And yet in spite of everything
he persisted. In speech after speech, at Conference after Conference, he took
up his parable, and sought to drive home the truth to the hearts and
consciences of his hearers. There can be no doubt that he succeeded far beyond
his most sanguine expectations. The wonderful liberality shown in these later
years has not been due merely to the larger resources of the Connexion, but to
the patient, persistent teaching and the brilliant example continued through a
generation, of Sir William Hartley."</p>

<p>And yet his enthusiasm for this cause did not degenerate into unreasoning
fanaticism. He recognized that the principle might be pushed to an extreme. He
wrote to a friend: "When we think of the life and sacrifice of Jesus Christ,
then nothing that we can do is too much; but possibly even this point of view
may be exaggerated, because in your case you have certain claims from a
personal and family point of view." This finds more trenchant expression in a
letter he wrote to the Rev. R. S. Blair. The Rev. Thomas Jackson and his wife
had done service at their mission in Whitechapel of quite an exceptional order
and at the cost of great and continuous personal sacrifice. The value of it may
be suggested by the fact that Sir Charles Russell, later Lord Russell of
Killowen, invariably attended the anniversary of the Primitive Methodist
Mission in Whitechapel to testify to the quality of Mr. Jackson's work. Sir
William's letter, dated August 9, 1900, explains itself.</p>

<blockquote>"I noticed by <i>The Primitive Methodist</i> last week that Mr. and
Mrs. Jackson were going to the extraordinary length of giving to the Home of
Rest the &pound;100 which we gave them from the General Missionary Committee
for their extra work and splendid management of the Whitechapel Institute job.
I don't at all approve of this; because they have no money to spare that they
need have gone to this extraordinary length. I think it was most extravagant on
their part considering their circumstances; but when they had made such an
enormous sacrifice I felt that I ought to send &pound;50, which I
did."</blockquote>

<p>On another occasion, when the Rev. W. Holland was, in spite of the gravest
medical warnings, returning for another term of missionary service on Fernando
Poo, Mr. Hartley was at the farewell meeting. The missionary secretary, the
Rev. J. Travis, said that in all their correspondence Mr. Holland had never
raised the question of money and did not know what his salary would be when he
reached Africa. Mr. Hartley's business instincts were somewhat outraged at such
proceedings. He exclaimed that it was most unbusinesslike, but it was
Christlike of Mr. Holland to act in this way; and he should not suffer for his
unselfishness, so he gave him &pound;20 to use as he wished.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3><i>Relations with his Church</i></h3>

<p>At this point it is desirable to give a connected record of Mr. Hartley's
relations with the Primitive Methodist Church. Several things will be dismissed
with bare mention, because detailed reference is made to them elsewhere. His
challenge offer of &pound;1,000 for the liquidation of the Missionary Society's
debt was made in 1884. At the annual Missionary Meeting held in the
Metropolitan Tabernacle in May, 1885, he was the Chairman, and the removal of
the debt was announced. At the Conference of that year the question of Chapel
debts was considered and a scheme proposed by Mr. Hartley was referred to a
committee of which he was a member. This committee recommended the formation of
an Association on the lines suggested by him. The scheme was finally sanctioned
by the Conference of 1889 and the Chapel Aid Association was registered January
2, 1890. Mr. Hartley became its treasurer. In 1890 the Conference appointed him
Missionary Treasurer. In 1891 he took up the cause of ministerial education,
offering to pay for five years the salary of a tutor at the College in
Manchester. This led to my appointment by the Conference of 1892. Of this
Conference Mr. Hartley was the Vice-President. As the Jubilee of the Missionary
Society was to be celebrated it was decided to raise a fund. The proposal was
for a comparatively small sum, but Mr. Hartley urged that &pound;50,000 should
be raised, of which he promised &pound;5,000. During his year of office he
travelled all over the denomination advocating its claims. The President of the
Conference was the Rev. James Travis and he rendered the most valuable service
to the Fund by his powerful appeals on behalf of the causes to which the Fund
was to be devoted. For several months he was speaking at meetings in all parts
of the denomination. As he was constantly accompanying the Vice-President it is
fitting to quote the tribute he pays to the services rendered by his
colleague.</p>

<blockquote>"The Vice-President (Mr. W. P. Hartley), especially considering the
demands of his great business, cheerfully devoted an amazingly large portion of
his time to this important movement. His clear and convincing presentation of
the question was always listened to with great respect. And his persistent
exhortations to proportionate giving, so strongly emphasised by his own
example, often made a great impression, and are still bringing forth fruit. It
is bare justice to say that, but for his munificent generosity and personal
influence, the movement would never have culminated in the success it did"
(<i>Seventy-five Years</i>, pp. 136 f.).</blockquote>

<p>The fund, which was successfully raised, was devoted in equal shares to the
Missionary Society, the College, the Chapel Loan Fund and the Superannuated
Ministers', Widows' and Orphans' Fund.</p>

<p>At the Edinburgh Conference, 1895, Mr. Hartley promised to defray the total
cost of the enlargement of the College, and this was completed and the first
extension opened at the Conference held in Manchester in 1897. At this
Conference the first Hartley Lecture was delivered, the lecturer being Dr.
Joseph Ferguson. It was he who had suggested to Mr. Hartley the founding of the
Lectureship and it had been sanctioned by the Conference of 1896.</p>

<p>It soon became obvious that a second extension of the College would be
necessary if the three years term of residence was to be maintained, since the
demand for men made by the circuits was so great. Mr. Hartley accordingly
promised to finance this addition, and the new buildings were opened at the
Conference held in Manchester in 1906. In the Primitive Methodist Church it is
possible for a layman to be President of the Conference, though since the
earliest days such an appointment has been extremely rare. Not a few felt that
it would be peculiarly fitting if when this superb gift, crowning what he had
previously done for ministerial education, was to be presented to the
denomination he should receive the highest honour it was in the power of his
Church to confer. Several of his friends mentioned the matter to him and he
considered it very carefully. He had all along felt that the time he could give
to the duties of the office would be rather limited, as he had much more on
hand than when he was Vice-President fourteen years earlier, especially as the
extension of his business to London had added considerably to his work. His
health was also very unsatisfactory. He sent a circular letter on March 14,
1906, to those friends who had spoken about it stating these difficulties and
adding that a recent experience had finally convinced him that it would be
unwise both in his own interests and that of the Church to accept the
nomination. He closed the letter with these words: "It is generous of my
friends to mention the matter and I value the suggested honour more than I can
express, but I have regretfully come to the conclusion that it would be unwise
to fall in with their kind suggestion."</p>

<p>The centenary of Primitive Methodism was celebrated in 1907 and 1910. The
former celebration was of the first Camp Meeting on Mow Cop, the latter was of
the formation of the Society Class in 1810, which has commonly been regarded as
the tiny nucleus which grew into the Primitive Methodist Church. The occasion
was naturally celebrated by the raising of a centenary fund. The sum fixed was
a quarter of a million, of which one hundred thousand pounds was to go to
denominational, and one hundred and fifty thousand to local objects. In view of
the fact that Sir William had only just before devoted a very large sum
(&pound;20,000) to the second extension of the College it was a fine expression
of his Connexional loyalty that he should give &pound;15,000 to this object. He
also accepted the treasurership. He was fortunate, as was the Church, in that
the organizing secretary of the fund was the Rev. George Armstrong, who devoted
to his task great gifts of organization and of advocacy. The fund realized more
than the total aimed at, though, unfortunately, the portion devoted to
Connexional objects fell somewhat short of the &pound;100,000 which had been
contemplated in the scheme.</p>

<p>In 1909 the Conference was held at Southport, where Sir William resided. It
was not unnatural that the thoughts of many turned to the hope that he would
allow himself to be nominated for the Presidency. A quotation from a letter he
wrote to me on June 4, 1909, will indicate his own attitude towards the
suggestion.</p>

<blockquote>"The matter had not entered my mind until I was approached in the
first instance by the Rev. James Pickett; and I replied to him that I always
considered I had not the requisite gifts, and that I could not take on work I
could not fulfil in a satisfactory manner. If I thought it would give real
satisfaction to our Church generally, that would weigh very much with
me."</blockquote>

<p>It was obvious that Sir William could not fulfil the Presidential duties as
commonly understood. During his year of office the President travels all over
the denomination, preaching and speaking. Sir William was not a preacher, and,
of course, the claims of his business made it impossible for him to spend a
great deal of his time in travelling. The suggestion put before him was that a
minister should be appointed as Vice-President who would undertake the duties
which normally fell to the President, while he would himself try to attend
gatherings which included the Churches of a city or a district.</p>

<p>When the Conference met he was elected President by a unanimous vote, the
Rev. John Welford being appointed Vice-President. His conduct in the
Presidential Chair was marked by great dignity, combined with a tendency to
curb prolixity and accelerate business. He had little patience with overmuch
talk in business meetings. I remember a humorous comment he made in one
Conference when a question involving about &pound;20 was being debated: "I
could make the money in the time that you are talking about it."</p>

<p>At this Conference he gave his report on the Holborn Town Hall, which he had
bought and offered to the denomination. The report was very well received; but
unfortunately at the next Conference, which was held at Tunstall, in connexion
with the second centenary Camp Meeting on Mow Cop, the Holborn Hall scheme was
severely criticized. He felt the criticism to be unjust and deeply resented it,
especially as the protagonist of the opposition was a colleague in charge of
the missionary department. He resolved to resign the treasurership of the
Missionary Society, and it was only in deference to extreme pressure put upon
him that this disaster was averted. Happily the breach was not permanent.</p>

<p><a name="il-7"></a><img alt="" src="0701091h-images/0701091h-07.jpg"></p>
</center>

<p>In 1916 Sir William attained his seventieth birthday. This was also the year
of his Golden Wedding, and among the other celebrations of the two events it
was natural that his own Church should take its part. The Conference of that
year was held at Nottingham, and the Rev. A. T. Guttery was President. The
General Committee had decided that a casket should be presented to Sir William
and Lady Hartley containing an illuminated address, which I had been asked to
prepare. An afternoon session of the Conference was devoted to the ceremony.
Before reading the address I touched on the coincidence that the Silver Wedding
had been spent in Oxford and that they had lunched in my rooms. The address was
as follows.</p>

<blockquote>The Conference of the Primitive Methodist Church<br>
<br>
 Held at Nottingham--June, 1916,<br>
<br>
 To<br>
<br>
 Sir William and Lady Hartley.<br>
<br>
 We offer to you, our dear and honoured friends, our warm congratulations on
the occasion of your Golden Wedding. We are grateful that God has granted you
this long and happy fellowship, and spared you to each other and to your family
through so many years.<br>
<br>
 But yours has been no secluded felicity, finding its satisfaction only in the
joys of home. Rooted in the love of God, it has found its constant expression
and enrichment in the loving service of humanity. The wealth won by genius and
unflinching toil has been held as a sacred trust, and a large and increasing
proportion of it has been definitely consecrated to God and distributed with
scrupulous care and discrimination. Your gifts, princely in themselves, have
stimulated generosity in others. The alleviation of poverty, the relief of
pain, the conquest of disease have been objects of your deep concern, as
almshouse, hospital, sanatorium, and endowment of research, abundantly testify.
Multitudes owe you undying gratitude for timely help in seasons of stress.
Profit-sharing and a generous scheme of insurance have helped to maintain happy
relations between employer and employed. And you have given not money alone,
but time and strength and anxious thought.<br>
<br>
 While we admire your catholic sympathies and far-reaching philanthropy, we
recognize with special thankfulness your loyalty to our Church and your
vigilant devotion to its interests. To its missions, its finance, the training
of its ministry, and the care of its orphans, you have rendered incalculable
service. If the burden of Chapel debts has been materially lightened; if
notable extensions of our work have been possible at home and abroad; if
students for our ministry have far ampler opportunities in a College splendidly
equipped and adequately staffed; we owe it largely to your munificence, your
statesmanship, and your vision. Nor have other parts of our work been excluded
from your generous interest.<br>
<br>
 In unabated affection and confidence we commend each of you to the care and
blessing of our Father in Heaven.<br>
<br>
 Signed on behalf of the Primitive Methodist Church:<br>
<br>
 Arthur T. Guttery, <i>President of Conference</i>.<br>
<br>
 Albert Shaw, <i>Vice-President</i>.<br>
<br>
 George G. Martindale, <i>Secretary</i>.<br>
<br>
 Matthew P. Davison, <i>General Committee Secretary</i>.<br>
<br>
 Samuel Horton, <i>General Missionary Secretary</i>.<br>
<br>
 John Mayles, <i>Financial Secretary</i>.<br>
<br>
 Joseph Johnson, <i>Book Steward</i>.<br>
<br>
 J. Dodd Jackson, <i>Editor</i>.</blockquote>

<p>The President of Conference made the presentation. He was an orator of great
gifts; his speech on this occasion was of the type to which no report could do
justice. Its lightness of touch, its dexterity of phrasing, its spontaneity,
its intimate sympathy combined to make it one of the most felicitous, perhaps
the most felicitous, address of its kind I ever heard.</p>

<p>Where so much had been done, the suggestion was not unnatural that Sir
William might expect exceptional deference to be paid to his wishes. On this I
am glad to quote an emphatic statement of his own in a letter of September 26,
1904, to the Rev. J. G. Bowran. It was with reference to a view expressed that
a unanimous vote of the Conference had been given to please him. He says: "I
think you will all agree with me that I have never desired our Conference to do
anything that was not in my opinion for the best interests of our Church and
the Kingdom of God, and I don't think that any person can point to anything
that I have suggested during the past fifteen years that has not turned out in
the end perfectly satisfactory to all concerned. I will never have it said that
I desire the Conference to do anything to please me, because such would be so
contrary to my true feelings. I certainly desire to give the Conference my
best, whatever that may be worth; but I have never wished that they should
follow my advice unless they were perfectly convinced that it was the right
thing to do."</p>

<p>He was amply justified in the claim that his advice when followed had been
vindicated by success, although in several instances he had to convince the
incredulous, to stimulate the laggards, or to overcome opposition.</p>

<p>The inspiration of his service was a deep and ardent loyalty to his Church.
Here he had been placed by Providence. In it his religious experience had come
to birth and found its unfailing nourishment. To it his devotion was primarily
due. Speaking once in the Conference with great emotion he made the words of
the Psalmist his own as he confessed his attachment to his Church: "If I forget
thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning!" He encountered
opposition, but he braced himself to meet it; criticism, but he was justified
by the event; he was hurt by disappointment and saddened by disillusion, but
they did not sour him or cause him to abandon his task in impatience or
disgust. To set over against these less happy incidents there was in his own
Church a great volume of appreciation and goodwill, of gratitude and pride. And
this was to be found especially in the ranks of its leaders, who were best
qualified by their intimate acquaintance with the problems to value aright the
contribution he made towards their solution.</p>

<h3><i>Reunion and Interdenominational Co-operation</i></h3>

<p>While he was a loyal member of his own Church he entertained very friendly
feelings towards other Churches, was a warm friend of interdenominational
enterprises and looked eagerly towards reunion. As was natural, Methodist Union
was nearest to his heart. Quite early in his career he favoured it and
advocated it in public utterances. The prominence he gave to the improvement of
ministerial education and the reduction of debt on Church property was partly
due to his desire that the Primitive Methodists should be prepared to take
their place in a Church comprising all sections of the Methodist people. He
supported the movement for the union of the Primitive Methodists with the Bible
Christians. This denomination had come into existence a little later than his
own and much in the same way. There was accordingly a natural sympathy between
them. As they were strongest in Devon and Cornwall, where Primitive Methodism
was relatively weak, the Union would have seemed on the surface to be a very
simple matter. It is one of the peculiarities of Primitive Methodism that in
its Conference and its District Synods the proportion of laymen to ministers is
two to one. The promoters of the Union recognized that it was desirable to move
towards a constitution which would be accepted by other Methodist Churches. As
it was quite clear that the "two to one principle," as it was called, would
have no chance of acceptance in a larger union the scheme was drafted embodying
the principle that the membership of the Conference and the Synods should be
equally divided between ministers and laymen. But the hostility aroused in
Primitive Methodism by this proposal was so great that the whole project was
decisively defeated. It is an interesting fact that in the negotiations now in
progress for Methodist Union no serious difficulty has been raised by the
Primitive Methodists on this point. What no doubt weighs heavily in this matter
is the consideration that the scale on which Union is now proposed is so great
and the object to be attained so worthy that an objection of this kind ought
not to be pressed.</p>

<p>The next movement for Union did not embrace Primitive Methodism. This was
the Union, effected in 1907, of the Methodist New Connexion, the Bible
Christians and the United Methodist Free Church. It must have been a surprise
to many that in negotiations of this kind the Primitive Methodists were not
included. Mr. Hartley was very much interested in the matter and invited a
number of Primitive Methodist ministers to meet three prominent officials of
the United Methodist Free Church who were members of the Joint Union Committee.
This was towards the end of September, 1904. He gave an account of the
gathering to the Rev. J. G. Bowran in a letter dated September 26, 1904. There
was a long and very frank conversation, the conclusion of which was that the
three Churches should continue their negotiations and when they had reached a
conclusion should report it to the General Committee. There was a unanimous
feeling that in the future the Primitive Methodists would be bound to come into
a Methodist Union of some kind or other or they would be discredited in the
eyes of the nation; but the officials were not ready. The letter continues:
"The three brethren of the Methodist Free Church were much pleased to hear at
first hand the view of thirteen of our ministers, and the idea was that the
three Churches now negotiating should proceed with their work and make their
constitution as wide and liberal as it was possible for them to agree to in the
hope that when they had finished it and submitted it to their quarterly
meetings again, (it was expected to take three years for final consummation
including an Act of Parliament), our Church might then, or at some future time
in the near future thereafter, be willing to accept their constitution as
settled by them without any alteration whatever."</p>

<p>The letter closes with the following paragraph, which is interesting for the
estimate of the strength of opinion among the members as contrasted with the
officials.</p>

<p>"Time is on the side of the Union Movement and it is now evident to my mind
that our officials will want a great deal of educating. Several brethren stated
on Friday that they had no fear that our membership would be sound on the
question if they were let alone, but that is just the point, because when a
Church Meeting is called the officials would be present and would influence the
members for or against the proposal."</p>

<p>This letter was followed by another on September 29, in which an answer is
given to the question why the Primitive Methodists had been left out. The
letter is as follows.</p>

<blockquote>Dear Mr. Bowran,--<br>
<br>
 It was unfortunate that the three Churches should begin their negotiations
without our being asked to join them. I raised this matter last Friday, and it
was explained that when the question of Union was before the Ecumenical
Conference the Methodist Free Church thought that they would like to talk the
matter over with the Bible Christians: but subsequently they came to learn that
many of the leaders of the New Connexion would also like to join in the
conversation, and the reason that we were not invited was twofold.<br>
<br>
 First, that we had recently failed to join with the Bible Christians.<br>
<br>
 Second, that Mr. Mitchell was reported to have said during the debate on Union
at the Ecumenical Conference that probably we should be the last to come
in.<br>
<br>
 I don't think this remark was premeditated, but no doubt these two things
together made them think that it was no use inviting us. Since that date we
have had many opportunities to come in and only have our selves to blame. I
quite agree with you that there is a vast difference between a small union and
a large one.<br>
<br>
 The Joint Committee meets in London, to-morrow, Friday, and they are certain
to report to our General Committee; but you see we have no mandate from
Conference to do anything but submit the matter to the Quarterly Meetings and
membership, and it was thought by the great bulk of the brethren last Friday,
if not even by all of them, that we were not yet ready and that it would not be
wise to submit it before next Conference, otherwise we might lose the vote or
only get a bare majority and so put back the thing for many years.</blockquote>

<p>He was in the warmest sympathy with the proposals for Methodist Union
between the Wesleyans, the Primitive Methodists and the United Methodists which
are now under consideration by the three Churches. He was a member of the Union
Committee, and although unable to attend he kept in close touch with the
negotiations. The future of the movement is still uncertain and he has been
taken from us before the final decision has been reached, but many of us hoped
that he would live to see the consummation of a desire he had long
cherished.</p>

<p>He often showed his friendliness to the other Methodist Churches. He was
anxious to secure cooperation between them and to avoid overlapping. When the
new coalfields were being opened in South Yorkshire and parts of Derbyshire and
Nottinghamshire he promoted a Conference to consider how the Methodist Churches
could do their share in keeping pace with the growth of population in these
areas. The Conference was held at Doncaster, and the three Methodist Churches
were represented at it. Sir William presided. The object of the Conference was
to formulate a policy by which overlapping and competition might be
avoided.</p>

<p>But his sympathies were not bounded by Methodism. He was in warm sympathy
with Dr. Shakespeare's proposals for the Union of the Evangelical Free
Churches. A Conference of between eighty and ninety delegates, appointed by the
national Unions or the governing bodies of the Churches concerned, was held in
Oxford to consider the proposals. When we consider the distinction of many of
its members and their multitudinous engagements it has always struck me as a
really amazing thing that not one of them was absent. Sir William and I
travelled together to it. It was held at Mansfield College, Oxford, and he
faithfully attended the sessions. Ultimately it proved impossible to create
more than a Federation of the Evangelical Free Churches. The Federal Council
meets annually. It has already justified its existence. Among its
representatives are many of the most distinguished ministers and laymen in the
denominations which belong to the Federation. The National Free Church Council
consists of representatives appointed by the local Free Church Council and the
chief sphere of operation is in the localities themselves. The Federal Council,
on the other hand, is armed with what authority it possesses by the
denominations themselves, and although its powers are strictly limited it can
speak in their name. It was providential that the Council came into existence
when it did, since there was a body in existence which could act for the
Evangelical Free Churches when the Lambeth proposals for Reunion had been made.
The final responsibility, it is true, must rest with the denominations
themselves, but the Committee which has met the bishops at Lambeth and in
particular the Free Church members of the sub-committee which has frequently
met at Lambeth to explore the ground have acted for the Federal Council.</p>

<p>As an illustration of his goodwill to other than Methodist Churches I may
mention a letter written on November 25, 1907, to Dr. J. H. Jowett. It was in
connexion with the founding of the Digbeth Institute, a project which was very
near to Dr. Jowett's heart. The letter contained a challenge offer, the final
thousand pounds of the &pound;25,000 required. Sir William said: "I am
constrained to do this in recognition of your great services to the Free
Churches of the country and I trust that other Free Churchmen will be moved to
help you liberally."</p>

<p>He was a generous supporter of the Y.M.C.A., he gave &pound;5000 towards the
building in Tottenham Court Road and &pound;1,000 towards a local scheme for
raising &pound;10,000. He was a good friend to the British and Foreign Bible
Society, of which he was elected a Vice-President.</p>

<p>He was very desirous of co-operation in humanitarian work between all the
Churches. This was never more clearly expressed by him than in connexion with
the movement for establishing an Institute in Aintree. The suggestion came from
him and he offered &pound;1,000 towards the project. At a meeting on March 4,
1892, he opened the discussion and said that the reform he would like to see in
that district was that all the Churches, from the Roman Catholic Church and the
Church of England down to the very smallest mission room, should enter into a
Christlike compact to fight against evil in every form. He hoped that in the
near future the combined Churches in that neighbourhood would erect in some
central position a large building, containing a concert and lecture hall and,
if possible, a gymnasium and reading room. The chief under lying idea that
struck him as new was that the work should be run by a committee of all the
Churches. It would then be known as the rendezvous of all good works, where
all, no matter what their religious creed, might meet to promote all good
objects. The cost would depend on the amount of money they could raise;
anything from &pound;3,000 to &pound;10,000 might be spent on the building. The
work would be carried on at a loss if it was carried on in the vigorous and
Christlike manner he would like to see, and he was quite prepared to subscribe
&pound;50 a year towards this cost. If the scheme was approved he suggested
that a Committee should be formed of half a dozen persons from each Church,
including the minister, and that it should have a free hand in determining
cost, style and accommodation.</p>

<p>The suggestion did not prove acceptable. More than two and a half years
later he spoke again upon the subject. He said how he had desired in that
district a centre and rallying point for everything that was elevating and of a
Christlike character. He would endeavour to bring into line every person in the
community for humanitarian works--everyone who desired to serve his fellows. He
had done his best during the past two years or more to arouse some local
sympathy in such a practical form as to result in the erection of suitable
premises. His efforts, unfortunately, had been unsuccessful. He did not feel
that he was called upon to provide such a centre, but he saw no chance of it
being provided in any other way, he therefore had decided to do the work
himself, entirely on his own responsibility. His plan was to give a site of
nearly three acres which would be laid out as a recreation ground with bowling
greens and tennis grounds. A cafe was to be built with two billiard rooms and
private dining rooms and a work man's restaurant, specially designed for the
carters who in large numbers daily passed along the two roads on which the cafe
stood. A large space was provided where the horses could be fed, and the scheme
also included large stables. A hall, to accommodate 650 people, measuring 64 by
40 feet, with balconies, was part of the plan. This would be fitted up with a
stage and the roof constructed in such a way that when the hall was not
otherwise in use it could be utilized as a gymnasium. Class-rooms and a
lecture-room would complete the building on the educational side.</p>

<p>The Institute and Cafe, costing with subsequent extensions &pound;12,000,
was thus provided entirely by Mr. Hartley in 1896. It was opened by the Earl of
Derby, who was at the time Lord Mayor of Liverpool, Mr. Hartley himself being
then a member of the Liverpool City Council. It has served a very useful
purpose for indoor and outdoor recreation and also for education, and it has
proved of value in its provision of refreshment free from the temptations of
the public-house.</p>

<p>As further illustrating his elevation above all narrow sectarianism I may
quote what he said when he gave the cottage homes to Colne: "There will be no
religious tests. Human need will be the only test."</p>

<h2><a name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3><i>Missions</i></h3>

<p>The Primitive Methodists, by the very conditions in which the denomination
came into being, were for many years absorbed in the evangelization of England.
This had the somewhat unfortunate result that they were late in undertaking
work in the foreign field. Their slender financial resources and their heavy
commitments at home were largely responsible for the slowness of their
development and the restricted areas in which they worked. In the early
eighties the Missionary Society had contracted a debt of about &pound;5,000,
which appeared extremely formidable. In 1884 Mr. Hartley, who was then at
Bootle, made the challenge offer which lifted him at once from local into
denominational fame. He offered to give &pound;1,000 towards the liquidation of
the debt on condition that &pound;4,000 was raised. In the light of later
achievements the debt appears trifling; but very competent judges believed that
the required sum would not be reached. The challenge, however, struck the
imagination of the people and appealed to their generosity, so that when the
missionary meeting was held in the Metropolitan Tabernacle in May, 1885, it was
possible to make the announcement that &pound;4,542 had been raised, and that
the debt had been removed. It was fitting that Mr. Hartley, who was still on
the youthful side of forty, should be the chairman of this meeting. His address
was on lines he was again and again to follow in the course of his career.
After a brief reference to the gratitude with which he thought of the connexion
of his family for three generations with Primitive Methodism, he turned to the
financial question. He thanked the members of the denomination for the thorough
and hearty manner in which his challenge offer had been met; but he called
attention to the slackness shown by many circuits in remitting the money,
thereby losing a considerable sum in commission and interest. He added that
this was all too characteristic of the general practice in remitting missionary
revenue to the treasurer, saying that it was high time that the circuits should
begin to send it without the loss of a single day after the accounts had been
made up. He then turned to the principle and practice which had made his own
gift possible, and enforced the duty and privilege of systematic giving. Later
utterances on this congenial theme are quoted elsewhere, but it is appropriate
at this point to record his first plea, addressed to the denomination as a
whole, for this cherished conviction.</p>

<blockquote>"A great many years ago I was led to see that there is only one
Scriptural mode of benevolence; indeed, to take much lower ground, I think
there is only one business-like mode, that is to set aside, to lay by, a
definite portion of our <i>gross</i> income for Christian purposes; and since I
have been acting upon this principle the distribution of the money so set apart
has been one of the greatest joys of my life...What a pleasure there is in
being able to conquer selfishness and go in for some degree of self-sacrifice!
You will agree with me that it is comparatively easy to swim with the stream of
ordinary outward Christian duties; but we are told on high authority that
unless we have the spirit of Christ we are none of His, and I appeal to you to
exhibit such a measure of the spirit of Christ as will enable you regularly and
cheerfully to set apart a definite portion of your gross income for Christ-like
purposes. The money is then no longer your own, to use for self, but simply
held in trust; and this applies to each of us, not only to the man with ten
talents, but also to the man who only possesses one. This is the ideal I set
before you, that I urge upon you, and I do it for your own sake; if you want to
feel the luxury of doing good have a separate fund wherewith to do it, then the
thing is easy and certain of accomplishment. I also urge it upon you for
Christ's sake, He who gave His life as a pattern, who died for you and for me,
who by His life and death calls upon us by acts of self-sacrifice to show to
the world that the Christian religion is a reality. When we have crucified the
natural selfishness which we all have more or less, and made the grand resolve
to regularly lay by in store as God hath prospered us, then it is simply a
stewardship, and as faithful stewards we have only to consider the various
claims that come before us, and give much or little as the cases deserve and
our funds will allow. It is not for me to say what proportion you ought to set
apart. Five per cent. of the gross income of a working man would be a greater
self-sacrifice than 20 per cent. from a man with a large income. What I plead
is, that each of us interpret our obligations in a liberal and not a niggardly
spirit. It is very easy to sing.<br>
<br>
 'My all is on the altar,<br>
I'm waiting for the fire;'<br>
<br>
 "and when we are full of enthusiasm we can sing:<br>
<br>
 'Were the whole realm of nature mine,<br>
That were a present far too small;'<br>
<br>
 "but, brethren, when we descend from the heights of ecstasy and poetry down to
our hard, every-day, matter-of-fact life, then is the time to keep our lamp
alight that the world may see our good works and glorify our Father which is in
heaven."</blockquote>

<p>When at the Conference of 1890 it was necessary to appoint a new missionary
treasurer to take the place of Mr. Henry Hodge it was only natural that the
name of Mr. Hartley should be suggested. At that time the Rev. James Travis,
who subsequently became President of the Conference and was some years later
President of the National Free Church Council, was General Missionary
Secretary. He reminded the Conference that the appointment was a most important
one and that the treasurer must not only be a man of good standing in the
denomination but also in the commercial world. He believed that the name he had
to submit would meet with universal favour; it was the name of Mr. W. P.
Hartley. He hoped the Conference would give a hearty and unanimous vote for the
nomination, and in that case he had little fear but that Mr. Hartley would see
his way to accept the office. His appointment would relieve the Missionary
Committee of much anxiety. His predecessor in the secretarial office, the Rev.
John Atkinson, seconded the nomination, heartily endorsing what Mr. Travis had
said, and adding that a more suitable man it would be very difficult to find.
The election was unanimously made on Saturday, June 7. Mr. Hartley was not in
attendance at the Conference, but he went to Sunderland on the following
Monday, June 9, accepted the office and had a most enthusiastic reception.</p>

<p>He devoted much thought and time to the duties of this office. He supported
the Missionary Society with generous gifts and stimulating offers. He watched
over its finances with as much, if not greater care, as he devoted to his own
business, and at certain times of the year advanced large sums to it. He took a
deep interest in the various spheres of operation and in the missionaries
themselves. Medical missions appealed greatly to him. When he was President of
Conference he spoke strongly on denominational short comings in this respect.
They had a Divine Master, he said, who went about proclaiming a Gospel of love
and healing the sick, and they had failed thus far in their attempts to found a
medical mission. If they had spent half the money on medical missions they had
spent on their ordinary missions in Africa they would have had far better
results. He paid for the training of Dr. Gerrard, the first medical missionary
sent to Africa by the Primitive Methodist Missionary Society. In a letter to
Mr. William Beckworth, written July 22, 1907, he refers to the desire of the
Rev. Edwin W. Smith, now Literary Superintendent of the British and Foreign
Bible Society, but at that time a Primitive Methodist missionary in Africa,
that the denomination should open a new mission in Africa. He said: "I am
willing to find half the money to found this new mission providing the other
half can be obtained throughout our Church without seriously interfering with
the ordinary income of our African fund." The minimum figure was placed at
&pound;3,000 and the maximum at &pound;4,000.</p>

<p>The rapid developments in Africa demanded a constantly expanding income. The
denomination for reasons already suggested has not shone in its provision for
missionary enterprise. It ought perhaps to be said that during his
Treasurership of the Missionary Society the money raised by circuits for this
object was nearly trebled. Much of the advance was due to the stimulus he gave
by offering large percentages on the increase beyond the previous year. When
the Jubilee of Primitive Methodist African Missions arrived it was decided to
celebrate it by raising a fund of &pound;50,000. That the sum was not larger is
to be explained by the heavy demands made for other needy causes. The centenary
fund by which over &pound;300,000 had been raised, lay not so far behind.
Immediately before the Jubilee was celebrated a Lightning Fund of &pound;20,000
had been raised to help superannuated ministers and the widows and orphans of
ministers in the hard struggle occasioned by the war, and immediately after it
a fund of &pound;60,000 was raised to place the Preachers' Friendly Society in
a financially sound condition. To the African Jubilee Fund Sir William
contributed &pound;5000.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3><i>Church Property</i></h3>

<p>Conspicuous service was rendered by Mr. Hartley to his Church in connexion
with the burden of heavy chapel debts. A period of great commercial prosperity
had encouraged the building of chapels on a large scale. The enterprises were
undertaken in a sanguine spirit, since it seemed that there was every prospect
of paying for them within a reasonable period. The rules requiring a certain
proportion of the cost to be raised before building was begun were much less
stringent then than they subsequently became. Unfortunately a period of trade
depression set in and the rosy anticipations with which the trustees had faced
the future were in very many instances grievously falsified. The condition
became one of acute struggle. The rate of interest was often high; the people
themselves were much poorer; to meet the current liabilities often imposed a
heavy strain upon them; to reduce the debt, except by desperate efforts, was
well-nigh impossible. The situation excited widespread concern and various
suggestions were made for grappling with the problem. The matter came before
the Conference held at Reading in 1885. Among the communications sent in there
was an important one from Mr. Hartley. In this he drew attention to the high
rate of interest paid in many cases. He urged that a company should be created
to borrow and lend money at reasonable rates and with easy repayment, and that
it should be managed on rigid business lines. A committee was appointed with
Mr. Hartley as one of its members and with the Rev. J. Travis as convener. The
policy which Mr. Hartley advocated had been carefully thought out by him
several years earlier, and he had pressed it on the attention of denominational
leaders. But at that time he had not established his reputation as a financial
expert, brilliant, far-sighted and safe; and his proposals were almost
universally regarded as impracticable. In <i>The Origin and History of the
Primitive Methodist Church</i> the Rev. H. B. Kendall thus summarises the
reasons urged against the scheme.</p>

<blockquote>"One of these objections was that the margin of profit allowed for
the payment of expenses was too small; another that the people of our Church
had no money to invest, and if they had they would not invest it in this
company; another that trustees who borrowed would not feel the same obligations
to pay promptly as though they had borrowed in the ordinary way--through a
solicitor."</blockquote>

<p>But in 1885 Mr. Hartley had stepped into the front rank of denominational
leaders and the committee which met in the autumn recommended the formation of
an association on the lines he had laid down. This resolution was accepted by
the Conference held at Derby in 1886, which also instructed the Committee to
continue its deliberations and lay their conclusions before the building
committees in the districts. The scheme went steadily, if somewhat slowly,
forward through the necessary stages; and the Conference held at Bradford in
1889 sanctioned it in its final form and on January 2, 1890, the Company was
registered. Mr. Hartley was its treasurer and the Rev. John Atkinson, who had
just retired from the missionary secretaryship, in which he was succeeded by
the Rev. J. Travis, was its secretary. The title of the Company was "The
Primitive Methodist Chapel Aid Association Limited."</p>

<p>The method followed was to receive deposits and to pay interest at 3-1/2 per
cent. The money was lent to trustees of Church property at 3-3/4 per cent.,
thus a quarter per cent. was left for working expenses. As we have already seen
it was one of the objections to the scheme that the margin left for working
expenses was far too small. This, however, was happily proved to be incorrect,
and Mr. Hartley's faith was, in this as in other respects, more than justified.
For not only has it sufficed for working expenses but it has made it possible
to build up a considerable reserve fund and make grants to special funds for
Church extension or debt reduction. One of the conditions was that a portion of
the debt should be repaid each year. In this way the debts continually grew
smaller and the burden of interest was lightened.</p>

<p>But naturally the success of such a scheme depended largely on its wide
popular appeal. For capital had to be provided in order that the loans might be
made, and confidence had to be created. With a comparatively low rate of
interest the depositors to be attracted were naturally those with small
investments to make. We might perhaps best describe them as belonging to the
class which was accustomed to put its savings in the Post Office Savings Bank
at 2-1/2 per cent. This was so widely popular because of its simplicity and its
absolute security. The Chapel Aid Association offered 1 per cent. more, but the
cautious small investor would naturally ask if it was safe. Mr. Hartley again
and again expounded its principles to the Conference and to District Meetings.
But he himself set a splendid example. He told the Conference that it was his
intention to invest his own money in the Association. He could, of course, as
he pointed out, have secured a much larger return than the modest interest the
Association paid; but he characteristically added that this was not the first
thing for a Christian man to consider. In this way he did much to meet the two
initial necessities of the situation--he provided capital and he created
confidence. Thus the Association was not crippled at the outset by inability to
advance money to trustees who wished to avail themselves of the great
advantages of the scheme; while investors who had only scanty savings to
deposit, and for whom safety was the all-important consideration, found in the
Chapel Aid Association an investment altogether to their mind. All the
forebodings of the pessimists were completely refuted; and although Mr. Hartley
himself was sure of success, his most sanguine anticipations were far exceeded.
The Association has been served by very able and careful secretaries; in
particular it owed very much in its initial stages to its first secretary, Rev.
John Atkinson. Great care has always been taken in making the loans to
trustees, and conditions are laid down which must be met. No one was more
competent to speak from personal knowledge of the value and success of the
movement than the Rev. James Travis, who had taken a large share in its
formation and who was twice asked to become the secretary of the Association.
Writing shortly before the out break of the war he said: "It has now been at
work for nearly a quarter of a century and has proved an unqualified success.
Its deposit account amounts to over half a million, and its securities are
ample beyond all question, and it is year by year adding to its reserve fund.
It has been an incalculable benefit to the trust estates during these years. No
one can estimate the indebtedness of our Church to Sir William P. Hartley for
conceiving the idea of the Association, paying its initial costs, financing it
in its early years, and for freely placing his prestige and eminent business
qualities at its service. It is one of the many memorials of the devotion of
Sir William to the interests of our Church such as no future historian of
Primitive Methodism can ignore."</p>

<p>The saving of legal expenses has been a great boon to trustees. The
necessary legal documents are prepared without charge by the secretary and no
cost is incurred beyond the very small amount incurred in stamp duty. Bad debts
are, I believe, unknown, and the interest is punctually paid.</p>

<p>The last report signed by Sir William as chairman is dated February 14,
1922. It was the thirty-second report and the figures it gives speak for
themselves. Reference is first made to the loans made by the Association to
trustees. These amounted during the year to &pound;65,934. The repayments
amounted to &pound;62,963, which means that the debts on Church property
throughout the denomination had been reduced by this sum. In a hundred and
twenty cases the total debt had been cleared off during the year. Turning next
to the deposits made by investors, we find that these amounted to
&pound;65,067. This year the repayments to depositors slightly exceeded the sum
invested, they amounted to &pound;65,169. The deposit account stood at
&pound;594,148, and the reserve fund at &pound;23,594.</p>

<p>The total amount paid off the debt on Church property up to the end of 1922,
a few weeks after Sir William's death, was &pound;1,388,868 4s. 1d.; and the
total number of loans paid off up to the same period was 1,365. During the two
years which followed the total repaid was over &pound;112,000 and the number of
loans paid off was 157.</p>

<p>The Association was supported by shareholders as well as by depositors, and
as the range of its operations widened it seemed desirable that the number of
share holders should be considerably increased. On February 1, 1904, Mr.
Hartley sent out a circular letter which it will be well to quote at this
point.</p>

<blockquote>Dear Sir,--<br>
<br>
 It will be known to you, the great success of the Chapel Aid Association. Our
investments are now upwards of &pound;360,000 and constantly increasing. I have
signed promissory notes during the last four weeks for over &pound;10,000 which
has been lent to the Association by various persons.<br>
<br>
 We have at present about 300 shareholders, holding from 5 to 50 shares each,
some more and some less. The Association has proved of good service to our
Church, and during the year 1903 Chapel debts were reduced by over
&pound;23,000 through our Association, and over &pound;160,000 from the
beginning. The Directors, along with myself, feel that the time has come when
the number of shareholders should be largely increased. The shares are
&pound;10 each with only 5s. paid up, leaving &pound;9 15s. per share as
reserve liability, and this of course is needful to give the requisite
confidence to the large number of persons who are constantly honouring the
Association by lending us money.<br>
<br>
 I should be glad if you would join us and I would respectfully suggest that
you take shares, more or less as you may desire. Of course there is no
compulsion, and you need not take them unless you wish. Interest at the rate of
3-1/2 per cent. per annum is paid to all shareholders every five
years.</blockquote>

<p>The response to this appeal was generally satisfactory; Mr. Hartley spoke of
it as "splendidly responded to by a large number of those to whom it was
addressed."</p>

<p>While the Chapel Aid Association was the most efficient piece of machinery
devised for the reduction of debts on Connexional property, Mr. Hartley did
much in other ways. For Colne, his birthplace, and adjacent towns he made
challenge offers. There were cases which demanded extraordinary help, and to
the Acute Cases Fund he contributed many thousands of pounds. He was all the
time helping local efforts all over the country for the removal of debt. But
his scheme for London deserves special mention.</p>

<p>Primitive Methodism has not made in London an advance corresponding to that
made in many other parts of the country. In accordance with his general
principle that the places where his trade was done had a special claim on his
help, he naturally felt that the erection of his works in London and the
increasing sale of his products constituted a call to greatly increased
attention to the metropolis in the allocation of his gifts. On January 12,
1905, he wrote a letter to a London minister, quoted elsewhere, in which he
said that he had as yet made no money in London. On the same day he sent a
letter to the Rev. T. Mitchell, the Rev. R. S. Blair, and Mr. E. C. Rawlings,
placing in their hands &pound;1,000 a year for three years, to consolidate and
extend, under carefully specified conditions, Primitive Methodist work in
London. This was the result of considerable deliberation.</p>

<p>Early in 1913 a much more elaborate scheme was launched. Dr. Mitchell, on
Sir William's request, ascertained the indebtedness of the chapels in the
Metropolitan area. It amounted to about &pound;75,000. Sir William proposed to
add an average of 25 per cent. to all raised for debt reduction during the next
five years, the fund closing on April 30, 1918. It was explicitly laid down
that no amount could be regarded as reduction of debt if the current account
was allowed to fall into arrears. He hoped that the offer would meet with a
hearty, and indeed an enthusiastic response, and that even if the debts were
not completely wiped out, at least every menacing debt would disappear. This
offer committed him to a maximum contribution of about &pound;15,000, and it
was hoped that the whole of this might be claimed. The outbreak of the European
War did not enter into the calculations of philanthropists and ecclesiastical
statesmen.</p>

<p>It is interesting to record that the Rev. J. T. Barkby, Sir William's
son-in-law and Ex-President of the Conference, who as Missionary Secretary
gained much first-hand knowledge of the problem, consented at the Conference of
1925 to become the Secretary of a Committee of Investigation, from which great
results may confidently be anticipated.</p>

<p>That Sir William was a warm supporter of the Chapel Loan Fund, which helped
worthy and necessitous cases, where the payment of interest was difficult, and
of the Church Extension Fund, designed to promote the establishment of new
Churches, goes without saying, but perhaps calls for no special emphasis. It
should be added, however, that both at Southport and at Aintree he did much to
secure worthier buildings. During his earlier residence in Southport and
Birkdale he stimulated the officials to build an excellent School Chapel in
Derby Road, Southport, and after his removal from Aintree to Southport he took
the keenest interest in the erection of a beautiful Church on the same plot of
land on which the School Chapel already stood. Besides large donations to the
building scheme and for the extinction of debt, he gave the organ, substituted
oak for a cheaper wood, and at a later period put in the stained-glass windows
elsewhere described.</p>

<p>Mr. Hartley rarely did anything more striking, I might even say more
spectacular, than when he purchased the Holborn Town Hall. The Hall was built
in 1879, at the junction of Clerkenwell Road and Grays Inn Road. The site cost
&pound;18,000, and the total expenditure on the building up to the time of its
sale was &pound;42,000. For some time the Holborn Borough Council was anxious
to sell it, and in 1907 it was put up for sale by auction. As &pound;27,000 was
the highest bid, the property was withdrawn. In the following year Mr. Hartley
made an offer to purchase. He had taken the greatest precautions to keep the
matter secret, and had not told anyone at all, except his private and
confidential clerk. He was accordingly much surprised when in the former part
of May, 1908, the negotiations were reported in the Press. The project of the
Council was by no means unanimously approved in the Borough. I well remember
calling on a friend of mine in Holborn. His father was a prominent citizen who
had taken an active part in opposing the Council's policy. He believed that the
property should be retained by the ratepayers, that it was worth much more than
the price the Council was willing to accept, and would grow in value as time
went on. Learning from his son that I was a friend of Mr. Hartley, he put his
view quite emphatically to me in conversation. And there were many others whose
opposition was equally strong. Mr. Hartley feared that premature publication
might damage the negotiations. The matter was, in fact, not immediately
settled; but it was so far advanced that when, about a month later, the
Primitive Methodist Conference met in London, provisional resolutions were
carried. The price named in the Press was &pound;30,500. The price named in the
Conference resolutions was slightly more. The crucial resolution was as
follows: "In the event of the purchase of this property by Mr. W. P. Hartley at
the price named, &pound;31,000, including organ, chairs, etc., the Conference
sanctions the leasing of the Hall to the Connexion at a perpetual ground rent
of 5-5/8 per cent. (&pound;1,123 l5s. 0d. per year), providing Mr. Hartley will
enter into a covenant to give the Conference the option of purchasing the same
at the price of &pound;31,000 within seven years."</p>

<center>
<p><a name="il-8"></a><img alt="" src="0701091h-images/0701091h-08.jpg"></p>
</center>

<p>This obviously gave effect to Mr. Hartley's own wish. His offer to purchase
the Town Hall was inspired by his desire to provide a centre in the metropolis
for his denomination. Here under one roof each department which had its
head-quarters in London could have its offices, and those in charge of the
departments could thus be in constant contact. Some important departments were
in the provinces, the College for the training of the ministry in Manchester,
the Sunday School Union in Leeds, the Chapel Aid Association in York. But the
General Secretary of the Church, the Missionary secretaries, the Editor, the
Book Steward, were all in London. Naturally it would not have been worth while
to purchase premises so extensive, simply to secure a set of departmental 1908
offices. But it was intended to provide a new Publishing House, or "Book Room,"
to use the traditional name. The Publishing House was at that time in
Aldersgate Street, to which it had been removed in the mid-nineties. To this
another Conference Resolution referred. It ran as follows: "That the Conference
approve the building of a suitable Book Room in the yard of the Town Hall, at
an outlay say of &pound;8,000 or thereabouts, and sanctions the sale of the
premises in Aldersgate Street, provided Mr. Hartley consents to finance the new
erection until the present property can be disposed of in accordance with this
suggestion."</p>

<p>It was thought that the large hall which was capable of seating 800 persons,
and was furnished with a fine organ, might be used for services on the Sunday,
and although this has not been done, it is possible that it may be realized in
the future.</p>

<p>The purchase was soon completed and the process of adapting the Hall to its
new function was begun. The scheme was lucidly expounded by Sir William Hartley
at the Southport Conference in 1909, of which he was President, and we cannot
do better than follow his description. He pointed out that the Hall was in a
grand position, very central, and best of all that it was a freehold property,
which constituted its great value. The site was unusually large, it would have
been extremely difficult to secure such a site anywhere else in London. The New
Publishing House was already half-built, every brick was set in cement, and
when finished it would be a most substantial erection. No premises in the City
would have more light and air. There would be ample space for goods to be
received and dispatched on their own premises, without interference with the
public roads. It would have five stories and accommodate an increasing
business. He proposed that the main building should be raised two stories, both
in the Grays Inn Road and the Clerkenwell Road. This could be done with perfect
safety since the structure had been built on very heavy lines, and in complete
harmony with the requirements of the London County Council. The two stories
would provide more than fifty excellent offices, so that when the
denominational requirements had been met there would be a large number of
offices to be let at a fair rental, which with other sources of income would
pay the working expenses and interest on the purchase money. The total cost of
the whole scheme would be about &pound;50,000. It was a considerable sum, but
he said, "The cost is right; if you don't like it, I do." If they did not want
the premises he would have them himself.</p>

<p>The descriptive report in <i>The Primitive Methodist Leader</i> indicates at
the close the impression made by this exposition of the scheme:</p>

<blockquote>"With his masterly statement, the President carried the Conference
with him completely. It should be stated that Sir William Hartley will hold and
finance this immense undertaking for some years to come, and the Connexion has
had enough proof, again and again, of his insight and foresight and business
prescience and ability to feel quite safe in his hands."</blockquote>

<p>This tribute did no more than justice alike to the quality of the statement
itself and to the leadership which for many years Sir William had placed at the
service of his Church. In spite of this the scheme was sharply criticized at
the Conference held in Tunstall in 1910. He was deeply hurt and said in reply
that if the Conference was apprehensive of the risk he would keep the premises
himself. Happily, the timid policy did not prevail. The scheme was completed,
the property was purchased by the denomination, the original name was changed
to "The Holborn Hall." Sir William's own contribution was &pound;17,500.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3><i>The Education of the Ministry</i></h3>

<p>It was inevitable that a denomination which had originated in a revivalist
movement led by laymen and at the outset drawing its converts from the ranks of
the poor and illiterate should be slow in making provision for the proper
training of its ministry. For one thing there was the urgent need for workers.
The fields were white unto harvest and the primary necessity was that the
labourers should be thrust into the field as rapidly as possible. This attitude
and policy will never be rightly appreciated by those who have not the
sympathetic imagination to envisage the situation as it presented itself to
these ardent missioners. They accepted without any shadow of misgiving the
current eschatology. The moment of death fixed for ever the fate of the
individual. The sharp division between the converted and the unconverted, the
sheep and the goats, was not toned down by any mediating devices. The destiny
of the unsaved was appalling beyond all conception. Hell was not simply a
mental state, it was a place. Nor were its torments limited to the
consciousness of irretrievable loss, to the pangs of unavailing remorse, or the
scourge of a guilty conscience. Its penalties were those of physical torture by
fire, intolerable yet unending. Evangelistic effort was not paralysed by the
sense of its futility, which would have been the logical effect of a scheme of
election and reprobation. The human will was free, at any moment the sinner
might turn from his evil way and live. No labour or sacrifice could be too
great to warn and save those who were rushing to their ruin, and the first duty
of the Church was to send out its messengers into a sodden and brutal England
and with affectionate urgency warn the unsaved to flee from the wrath to come.
Delay might mean that souls which could have been won for heaven would be
doomed for eternity to horrible suffering in hell. For this task education and
a training in the technicalities of theology was less essential than an
unshrinking belief in the current evangelical creed, an unwavering faith in
"the plan of salvation," a profound pity for the lost, a sense of desperate
urgency, and, of course, the evangelistic gift. So in their thousands their
converts streamed into the Kingdom.</p>

<p>But this inevitably created the problem of the spiritual and moral training
of these new members of the Society. The meetings were still largely
evangelistic in character and the members were expected to support this side of
the work. But definite teaching and exposition had to be given to them, and
even though this was rudimentary it involved study and preparation. For the
most part the preachers were eager for self-improvement and their efforts to
make good the deficiencies of early education were often beyond all praise. Out
of a salary which was but a meagre pittance they saved money to buy books, they
met for study in small groups, they toiled hard to equip themselves for the
worthy discharge of a teaching ministry. The emphasis was unavoidably shifted
as the congregations consisted more and more of those who had been born into
the denomination and not brought into it from outside. Evangelism was still the
ruling passion, but the training of the children and of the young people became
more and more important. And this accelerated the tendencies which were to
result in far more thorough provision for the training of the ministry. It must
at this point be explained that when a man was accepted for the ministry, the
first four years of his ministerial career were spent on probation. A course of
study with an annual examination was prescribed for this period, so that by the
time that he was accepted into "full ministry" he had been compelled to pass
through a course of study which furnished him with some measure of intellectual
equipment. It became clear, however, that definite training was needed before a
man entered the ministry, though the system of probation, with its course of
four years' study, still remained and has in fact remained till this day.
Private enterprise on the part of some of the better qualified ministers
effected something; but accommodation had been provided and some training had
been given at Elmfield College, a denominational school in York. A college for
the training of ministers was opened at Sunderland, and some time later another
college was established in Manchester, the tiny nucleus out of which Hartley
College has grown. The college at Sunderland was abandoned, and although for a
long time there was no necessity for a man to pass through college before he
was taken into the ministry, the tendency was developing in the direction of
making this the more usual course. The first Principal of the Manchester
College was the Rev. James Macpherson, and he remained as a tutor when he was
succeeded in the principalship by Dr. Joseph Wood. Mr. Macpherson had given
generous help to young ministers in their study, he had been the denominational
Editor and the President of Conference, and he did much by his advocacy and his
work to make the Manchester College possible.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that there was great apathy on the whole subject, not
so much in the ranks of the ministry itself as among the lay officials and the
members. This indeed was not unnatural. Where revivalistic passion was intense
the necessity for college training was apt to be depreciated. The earlier
preachers had succeeded amazingly well without it; the simple Gospel could be
assimilated and proclaimed without prolonged and directed study. But the
objection was not merely negative. Multitudes were convinced that college was
positively dangerous. The ardent young evangelist, all on fire for the
salvation of souls, ran the risk, it was firmly believed, of losing his
revivalistic zeal and becoming coldly intellectual in his ministry. It was not,
indeed, at that time a count against the college training that it infected its
victims with heresy; a conservatism so rigid as that of Mr. Macpherson and Dr.
Wood would be but rarely found among Primitive Methodist ministers to-day.</p>

<p>It has been necessary to give this long historical explanation, since
otherwise the significance of the new development with which Mr. Hartley was so
intimately connected would be far from clear. I must also apologize that in
what follows my own part should be so prominent, but this cannot be
avoided.</p>

<p>In May, 1891, Mr. and Mrs. Hartley were taking a driving tour, accompanied
by Miss C. Hartley, who later became Mayor of Southport, and the Rev. F. N.
Shimmin. They stayed for a few days in Oxford, and my friend, Mr. J. Harryman
Taylor, who was in training for the Primitive Methodist ministry at Mansfield
College, brought them round to my rooms at Merton College on the Saturday
evening. They lunched with me on the Monday. It happened that I had at this
time been thinking a good deal about the training which was being given at the
Manchester College. I was profoundly dissatisfied with the situation. The
length of the course, one year, was quite inadequate, the curriculum was
antiquated and reactionary. I spoke about the matter to my guests with freedom.
Mr. Hartley himself had helped the College but had no special interest in it
and had in fact, when sending a contribution to Mr. Macpherson, intimated that
this was the last that he might expect from him. Mr. Hartley was much
interested as I expounded my ideas on the vital necessity of ministerial
training and on the kind of training which should be given. It was of course
quite natural that this should be on my mind since, after attending Dr.
Fairbairn's lectures for three years with the greatest profit, I had accepted
his invitation to join the teaching staff of Mansfield College. I was
accordingly painfully sensitive to the defectiveness of the training for the
ministry in my own Church. Beyond this I think there was nothing in my mind. I
was very happily settled in Oxford. I had my Fellowship at Merton and my
lectureship at Mansfield. I had planned my chosen line of study and my future
literary work for some time ahead. But I believe that Mr. Hartley's mind at
once moved forward to plan the development which actually followed. But of this
I did not learn till later. Soon after he communicated with Mr. Taylor on the
matter, and in this way I learnt that he was considering the question whether I
could be induced to leave Oxford for Manchester. I was naturally much exercised
over the suggestion. In nearly every way the proposal was unattractive. My
roots were very deep in Oxford as I had been there for eight years. My work and
the conditions in which it was done were thoroughly congenial. I had many
intimate and valued friendships. On the other hand I recognized that the
opportunity of serving my own Church was a great one, though I was too ignorant
of the situation to realize how momentous the decision might be. My mind moved
gradually in the direction of acceptance, should the request come to me. I knew
that Mr. Hartley, without mentioning my name, I believe, had suggested the new
policy to the College Committee and the attention of the Conference was called
to it in its Report. I wrote to Dr. Fairbairn on the matter, partly in duty to
him as my chief, partly because there was no one whose advice I should have
valued so much. He wrote me a letter which has been printed in his <i>Life</i>
by Dr. Selbie (pp. 244-5). His personal desire was that I could remain in
Oxford; but he felt that the opportunity was very great and that I had been
raised up to do the work that was most necessary. The next time we met he
expressed his sorrow at the prospect of my leaving Mansfield, as everything had
been so happy, but once again dwelt on the opportunity for service. Some time
later, when the matter had come into the sphere of practical politics, he told
me that he had thought about it again and again, his judgment oscillating but
always in the end settling to the conviction that I ought to go.</p>

<p>The Conference of 1891 was held at Northampton. I had already intended to
visit it as I had never attended a Conference. The President, Dr. Ferguson, and
Mr. Hartley very kindly introduced me to the assembly. At a later point in the
proceedings, when the College Report was under discussion, he urged the
appointment of a new tutor to whom a free hand should be given, and said that
he would finance the new departure for five years. He mentioned my name in the
course of his speech in illustration of the kind of appointment he had in his
mind. After I had left the Conference and returned to Oxford the proposal was
definitely made that I should be asked to meet the College Committee. I had
told Mr. Hartley before I returned to Oxford that I should be willing to
consider the question. On June 19 he sent me the following telegram.</p>

<blockquote>"Conference decided that a Committee meet you personally to talk
over College course, entrance examination and your probable
engagement."</blockquote>

<p>It is no cause for surprise that the suggestion was met in several quarters
with hesitation and criticism. I was only twenty-five years of age at the time,
very little known in the denomination, and of course there was the question
whether I should be theologically "sound." The term which had been used to
designate my office was "classical tutor." I interpreted the term in the sense
it would commonly bear, and as I had chosen theology for my life work I had no
intention of abandoning this for the classics. My own indication that I wished
to teach theology was in its turn somewhat misunderstood. Up to that time
systematic theology, by which Methodist theology was understood, had always
been in the hands of the Principal, and it was not unnaturally felt that it
should remain where it was. This was entirely agreeable to me. I was no
specialist on this subject, and, if the truth must be told, had only a tepid
interest in Methodist theology as such, though I was interested in systematic
theology in the larger sense. But when I had spoken of theology as the field I
desired to cultivate I had not systematic theology in my mind at all. My work
was to be done on the Old Testament, the New Testament and the History of
Doctrine. I mention this because it is necessary for the full understanding of
a letter I received from Mr. Hartley in reply to one in which I had put my
ideas before him and called attention to the difficulty occasioned by the use
of the term "classical tutor." His letter was as follows. <i>September 17,
1891.</i></p>

<blockquote>Dear Mr. Peake,--<br>
<br>
 Yours of 15th and I agree with everything you say; indeed it is exactly to my
mind, every word. I do not know when the committee desire to meet you, but I
will take care to be present myself if it be at all possible, that is, nothing
even of the first business importance, shall prevent my being present.<br>
<br>
 I will write you again in a few days after I have made a little private
inquiry. I think you may rest contented that the use of the word "classical"
was simply either ignorance or inadvertence.<br>
<br>
 When you meet the Committee you must not forget to come to Aintree to see us.
Hope you are well; all my people join in kindest regards.<br>
<br>
 Yours truly,<br>
<br>
 W. P. Hartley.</blockquote>

<p>A sub-committee consisting of seven members, and including Mr. Hartley, met
me at the College, and I put my views fully before it. A resolution was passed
very cordially recommending my appointment. A pleasant feature of my visit was
that we met the students then in residence and Mr. Hartley and I addressed
them. I went with him to Aintree for the night, making the acquaintance of
those members of the family whom I had not yet met, and returned to Oxford on
the following day. Subsequently I met the full committee at its Quarterly
Meeting in May, 1892, if I remember rightly, and put my plans before it, and a
resolution was passed recommending my appointment to the Conference to be held
at Norwich in June. Mr. Hartley, it is needless to say, was present to advocate
the proposal which he had been the first to suggest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, another very important step had been taken, also on his
initiative. The Conference of 1891 had made the normal term of residence two
years instead of one, and this at once raised the question of an extension of
the College building. The College could at that time accommodate twenty-eight
students. What was now suggested will be clear from the following letter which
Mr. Hartley circulated to a large number of ministers and laymen.</p>

<blockquote>April 8, 1892.<br>
<br>
 Dear Sir,--<br>
<br>
 A special sub-committee of the Manchester College was held on Tuesday last to
take into consideration the desirability of enlarging the College
buildings.<br>
<br>
 By order of the last Conference, students are in future to stay a minimum of 2
years and the Committee unanimously agreed to recommend that accommodation be
provided for 32 additional men, making a total of 60; that would be practically
duplicating the present College buildings and would allow a maximum of 30
students to enter our ministry each year, but as I hope some would probably
prefer to equip themselves still more thoroughly by staying 3 years, we might
take it that 25 men would be available for the ministry each year, and as this
number is under the required yearly average, no stronger argument need be used
to show the urgency of the suggested extension.<br>
<br>
 Until this is done we cannot educate the requisite number of men for our
ministry, and under these circumstances the Conference has to fall back upon
young men of very imperfect education, and practically no training, which in my
opinion is disastrous to our connexional influence.<br>
<br>
 Now that a forward movement has been inaugurated, and the service of Mr. A. S.
Peake, M.A., Oxford, secured as tutor, the committee think this an opportune
time to ask the permission of Conference to enlarge the College buildings. The
estimated cost is &pound;5,000, and as I feel most strongly the importance of
the better education of our young ministers, believing it to lie at the very
root of our future connexional prosperity, I have offered to give one third of
the total amount, namely &pound;1,666 13s. 4d., on condition that the remainder
is subscribed.<br>
<br>
 The committee desire me to ask your favourable consideration of the scheme, in
the hope that you will signify your approval by adding your name to the
subscription list. It will probably be two years before the whole of the money
will need to be paid, and necessarily a considerable time will elapse, before
even the first instalment is wanted.<br>
<br>
 I have addressed a copy of this letter to about 150 of the ministers and
laymen best known to me, to test the question, and shall be glad of replies,
say in a week, so that they may be laid before the specially summoned meeting
of the College Committee, which is to be held this month. I have for some years
been trying to render assistance to various connexional projects, and I
earnestly hope you will lend your valued co-operation to this important
proposal.<br>
<br>
 Yours truly,<br>
<br>
 W. P. Hartley.</blockquote>

<p>At the meeting of the sub-committee Mr. Hartley made it clear in his speech
that on no account did he wish the scheme to go on unless the committee was
unanimous in its support. Several speeches were made, some for and some
against; but in the end a unanimous vote was given for a further appeal to be
made and the work to go forward.</p>

<p>The Primitive Methodist Conference of 1892 met in June at Norwich. As is
related elsewhere, Mr Hartley was elected its Vice-President and the Jubilee
Fund was inaugurated. It was momentous, however, for the cause with which we
are concerned in this chapter. Cinderella stepped into the limelight. A public
meeting to advocate the claims of ministerial education was held, at which Dr.
Fairbairn, Dr. Wood and I were the speakers. Mr. Hartley was in the chair. The
meeting was an extraordinary success. Dr. Wood excelled as a racy and
felicitous speaker and he was heard to great advantage on that occasion. My own
address, apart from the personal note which was inevitable on the occasion, was
chiefly directed to expounding and commending the lines on which my work at
Manchester would, if I should be appointed, be conducted. Dr. Fairbairn was
rather uncertain as a speaker, but at his best he stirred and moved me as
scarcely any speaker to whom I have listened. That night he "got away," and his
speech, which was greatly conceived and magnificently expressed, was inspired
by a passionate conviction and transfigured by an emotional glow which places
it in my memory among the finest it has been my lot to hear. It produced a
profound and an enduring impression. The following morning I was, without any
dissent, appointed a tutor of the Primitive Methodist College with a free hand
to plan my own curriculum and teach on my own lines. Looking back to that
action across the intervening three and thirty years I pay a sincere and
grateful tribute to the generous confidence which it implied. But its intrinsic
significance went much deeper than any personal element in the situation. It
meant that, for the first time, the official training of the ministry in the
Primitive Methodist Church was in contact with the modern spirit and outlook.
That it fell to me to be the pioneer in this respect was more or less
accidental; the essential thing was that whether through one channel or another
the new light should be suffered to shine. The credit for making it possible
and securing its acceptance by Conference belongs to Mr. Hartley more than to
any man. It is, of course, well known that there was for a time not a little
uneasiness and even resentment in some quarters at the kind of teaching I was
giving to the students. But it scarcely ever found public expression; and the
really important thing is that year by year the College Committee has
recommended and the Conference has passed my reappointment without discussion
and has from time to time appointed new colleagues who occupied a standpoint
similar to my own.</p>

<p>The Jubilee Fund was inaugurated with the object of raising &pound;50,000,
and it was necessary for the Conference to determine how the money should be
allocated. On this Mr. Hartley wrote to me from the Conference on June 14: "I
have been careful to put the College right in this effort; we shall get
&pound;12,500 out of the &pound;50,000. This will pay for the extension,
capitalize the ground rent, and leave 4 or 5,000 to spare."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, however, the extension of the College was delayed
because some were not convinced of its necessity. When it was actually taken in
hand Mr. Hartley assumed the entire financial responsibility. The building was
planned on an ampler scale. He laid the foundation stone on May 12, 1896, and
the extension was completed and opened at the Conference in 1897. The total
cost was &pound;12,500 and the share of the College from the Jubilee fund was
handed over to it intact. The opening ceremonies concluded with a meeting in
the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, with Mr. Hartley in the chair and Dr.
Fairbairn as the chief speaker.</p>

<p>It was usual for Mr. Hartley to attach conditions to his promises, and the
offer to extend the College was accompanied by the condition that the course
should be extended to three years. At this time Dr. John Watson was Principal,
and when his five years term of office came to an end he was succeeded by the
Rev. G. Parkin. Dr. Watson remained on the College staff, taking the
superintendency of a circuit in Manchester and relieved of part of his circuit
duties by an assistant. The double responsibility, however, proved too great,
especially when death deprived him of the companionship and help of Mrs.
Watson, which had been his mainstay for many years. A disastrous breakdown
abruptly terminated his connexion with the College, and at the following
Conference it became necessary to appoint a second full-time tutor. Mr.
Hartley's nominee for the position, the Rev. A. L. Humphries, was appointed. At
the end of Mr. Parkin's term it was felt to be necessary to appoint an
assistant tutor. It was realized that this was only a temporary expedient and
that a third tutor would be necessary. The Rev. W. L. Wardle accordingly became
assistant tutor in 1903. Mr. Hartley eased the new departure by payment of the
salary for a term of years. In due course Mr. Wardle became a full tutor. It
was clear, however, that the whole group of philosophical subjects, of which
only a section could be taken by the existing staff, in view of their other
duties, ought to be entrusted to a tutor who was a specialist in those
subjects. For this post Mr. Atkinson Lee was suggested and the appointment was
made by the Conference of 1908, Mr. Hartley again financing the new departure
for a term of years. It should be borne in mind that it was not merely the
desirability of having the subject taught much more fully than had been
previously possible, but also the necessity of readjusting the work so as to
relieve the Principal, whose administrative duties had become much heavier, of
systematic theology. This subject was now entrusted to Professor Humphries, who
combined with it part of the New Testament Exegesis and Greek, while Professor
Wardle was responsible for Hebrew and English.</p>

<p>Soon after the enlargement had been completed in 1897 experience made it
clear that the needs of the denomination demanded a larger building still. The
extension had been planned so that the College might accommodate sixty
students. Before long seventy were in residence and special provision had to be
made. But it was necessary to contemplate a second extension. The complete
responsibility for this was also under taken by Mr. Hartley. The building was
now planned to accommodate 105 students which, assuming a three years' course,
would permit an average of over thirty students to be sent into the ministry
each year. A much larger dining-hall was required, and this set free the old
dining-room for a lecture room. The new building contained in addition new
rooms for the students and for the staff built in a quadrangle which also
included a new and much larger lecture room. The College Chapel was added at
the end of the quadrangle. The library had been used by the students as their
Common Room, but this unsatisfactory arrangement was brought to an end by the
provision of an entirely new library. The second extension was, of course, on a
much greater scale than its predecessor. Its cost was &pound;20,000. The new
building was opened at the Conference of 1906 which was held in Manchester. Mr.
Hartley opened the door of the chapel. A tablet commemorating his double gift
was unveiled by his friend, Mr. William Beckworth of Leeds, for long one of the
most prominent lay leaders in the denomination and a very finished speaker, who
had spoken at the Free Trade Hall meeting in 1897. The inscription on the
tablet was as follows.</p>

<blockquote>This tablet commemorates the munificence of William P. Hartley
Esq., J.P. of Southport who, for the glory of God, and moved by his profound
sense of the value of ministerial education, built and presented, completely
furnished, to the Primitive Methodist Church this Chapel and the adjacent study
block, at the same time adding the new dining-hall and library to the older
block, the greater portion of which had been similarly erected and presented by
him in 1897.<br>
<br>
 Unveiled at the opening of the later enlargement during the Conference in
Manchester, June 18th, 1906.</blockquote>

<p>After the tablet had been unveiled the opening sermon was preached by Dr.
Fairbairn and a short meeting followed, held in a tent. The evening meeting was
held in the Free Trade Hall. Mr. Hartley was in the chair and the meeting was
addressed by the Rev. J. Dodd Jackson, Dr. James Hope Moulton and Dr.
Fairbairn.</p>

<p>In 1907 Mr. Hartley wrote to me expressing his desire that such students as
were competent to do so should enter the University of Manchester and take
their degree. Since many who read this volume may not understand the conditions
and will think of University training as a natural part of the education for
theological students, it is necessary at this point to explain the difficulties
as they affect the Methodist Churches. It has already been pointed out that a
Methodist minister is required as a normal thing to spend four years on
probation. He is not allowed to marry till his probation has been
satisfactorily completed and the salary he receives as a probationer is much
less than that of a man who is on the list of fully approved ministers.</p>

<p>In a paper on "Interdenominational Possibilities in Ministerial Education,"
which I had read several years before to the National Free Church Council at
Sheffield, I had spoken of this system as a millstone round the neck of
educational reform. It is clear that so long a probation almost inevitably
involves a much briefer College course. The system generally followed at the
University of Manchester is that an Arts Degree is taken in three years and the
B.D. Degree in two years more. It is obvious that a College course of five
years, followed by four years of probation, would involve in a large majority
of cases a very heavy burden on the student and his friends and make him unduly
old before his probation ceased. Yet the connexional system makes it very
difficult to touch the term of probation. A circuit which takes a student when
he leaves College pledges itself to provide for a married preacher at the end
of four years. This involves a much heavier financial responsibility, since a
house has to be furnished and a much larger salary paid. It is assumed that the
four years interval will make the assumption of additional responsibilities
possible. It is accordingly out of the question to abolish the system and
difficult to modify it.</p>

<p>In my reply to Mr. Hartley's letter I pointed out that there were three
types of student to be considered. There were those who had already graduated
and who could proceed at once to the B.D. course, which would be completed in
two or three years. There were the students who had already matriculated who,
if they could face a five years' College course, could take their Arts and
their Divinity degrees. The third case was of students who had not matriculated
but who, at the end of two years spent on the ordinary curriculum, might
succeed in matriculating and completing their Arts course in three years. In
the two former cases some modification of probation might reasonably be
granted. Mr. Hartley approved of the suggestions and they went through the
College Committee with the recommendation that the modification allowed should
be the reduction of probation from four years to three and exemption from
probationers' examinations. He undertook the whole cost of financing the
scheme, but, as was not unusual, he committed himself to a limited period only.
This was again and again extended and the support was continued till his death,
and all students who had entered on their University course at the time when he
was taken from us will have the cost of completing it defrayed by his
executors. They also generously admitted new students to the advantages of the
scheme in the year following his death. Those who have had intimate knowledge
of its working will be the first to recognize that this was among the
conspicuous services he rendered to the cause of ministerial education. The
Conference held at Scarborough in 1925 assumed responsibility for the
future.</p>

<p>A letter written by Sir William on October 10, 1908, may here be quoted as
indicating the feeling with which he looked back on the history of the work
that had been done for the cause. My volume <i>Christianity: Its Nature and its
Truth</i> had just been published, and I had dedicated it to him. The
dedication was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>TO<br>
<br>
 SIR WILLIAM P. HARTLEY<br>
<br>
 Large-hearted in Philanthropy<br>
<br>
 Fertile and Sagacious in Counsel<br>
<br>
 Faithful in the Stewardship of Wealth<br>
<br>
 I Dedicate this Volume in Gratitude for the Privilege of his Friendship<br>
<br>
 in Admiration of his Conspicuous Services<br>
<br>
 to the Cause of Ministerial Training.</blockquote>

<p>His reply was as follows.</p>

<blockquote>Dear Dr. Peake,--<br>
<br>
 It is very good of you to send me your book <i>Christianity: Its Nature and
its Truth</i>. I received it safely last night on my arrival home, and all at
Sea View were much pleased both with the book and with your great kindness in
dedicating it to me. The words of the dedication are exceedingly choice and
beautiful, and touch us very much.<br>
<br>
 What a wonderful change for the better has come over the ministerial education
in our Church since we first met in Oxford. Neither of us at that time could
foresee the wonderful events that would happen.<br>
<br>
 We are all very glad that Mrs. Peake and the children are coming to winter in
Southport, and that you will usually be down for the week-ends. It will give us
many opportunities of important conversations.<br>
<br>
 We again thank you.<br>
<br>
 Yours truly,<br>
<br>
 W. P. Hartley.</blockquote>

<p>Another letter may be added here as it indicates the way in which he wished
his contribution for this purpose to be administered.</p>

<blockquote><i>November 15, 1909.</i><br>
<br>
 Dear Dr. Peake,--<br>
<br>
 I note that one of the students wishes to take a class in Hellenistic Greek in
addition to his Arts work, and from what you say I think he should do it. As
regards the payment would it not be better to let the young fellows pay such
items as these themselves; in other words is it not possible to do too much for
them?<br>
<br>
 I leave it entirely to your judgment. I only want to make the best use of my
Charity money, and you can just act as you think is the best and I shall be
agreeable whatever it may be. I leave the whole matter in your hands both
present and future to act as you think is best, giving me the minimum of work
and correspondence.</blockquote>

<p>On the suggestion of the Rev. George Armitage, at that time the secretary of
the College, it was decided to recognize the completion of twenty-one years of
my work at the College. The actual date was 1913, but from various causes the
ceremony itself took place on June 11, 1914. A portrait painted by Mr. Nowell
was unveiled by the Rev. John Day Thompson. When Sir William heard of the
suggestion he warmly approved of it and intimated his intention of taking a
special part in it himself. He had previously, in recognition of his election
as President of the Conference, which was held in 1909 at Southport, put some
stained-glass windows in the Church where the Conference was held and which he
himself was in the habit of attending. At his request I had submitted a scheme
to him, which he approved. The large window represented the Visit of the Magi
and eight windows appropriate for single figures were filled as follows: Moses
and Isaiah represented the Old Testament, Paul and John the New, Athanasius and
Augustine the undivided Church, Luther Protestantism, and John Wesley
Methodism. The artist was Mr. Arming Bell. In a letter Sir William wrote to me
on April 15,1912, he said: "In connexion with the twenty-first anniversary of
your appointment to Manchester I am intending to put in the stained glass
windows to the College Chapel, and at some mutually convenient date, I must
come over to Manchester and have a conversation with yourself and your
colleagues as to what is the best to be done. I cannot fix a date just yet, but
I must do my best to spare an afternoon before my summer season begins. We must
make up our mind first of all what has to be done, and then we will bring in
the artist Mr. Anning Bell."</p>

<p>When he met us it was decided that three stained-glass windows should be put
in. I suggested that the window over the communion table should represent
Christ at Calvary. I did not wish that the actual Crucifixion should be
represented since I felt this to be morbid. The moment chosen for
representation was when Jesus had actually reached Calvary but before the
execution itself had begun. In view of the fact that the College was designed
for the training of the ministry I suggested as the subjects for the other
windows Elijah on Carmel and Paul at Athens. The suggestions were cordially
accepted and the artist produced three beautiful and striking windows. The
Principal of the College, the Rev. H. J. Pickett, presided at the afternoon
ceremony and Sir William unveiled the windows. He said that he looked back with
unalloyed pleasure to my appointment in 1892. In my reply I recognized to the
full how impossible it would have been for me to carry on my work if it had not
been for the munificence with which Sir William had helped us, the courage with
which he had confronted difficulties and the statesmanship with which he had
guided our course. He presided at tea, and interesting speeches were made by
Professor F. E. Weiss, the Vice-Chancellor of the University, Dr. J. H.
Moulton, at that time Dean of the Faculty of Theology, the Rev. James Travis,
Professor Humphries, the Rev. George Armitage, and the College treasurer, Mr.
T. L. Gerrard, who made a presentation to my wife and myself. One feature of
the celebration which gave me peculiar pleasure remains to be mentioned. In
addition to his gift of the windows Sir William founded a number of
scholarships and half-scholarships for needy students. My relations with the
students had always been very happy. I knew something of the difficulties they
had to meet and was glad to think that I had been the occasion of such timely
and welcome help.</p>

<p><a name="il-9"></a><img alt="" src="0701091h-images/0701091h-09.jpg"></p>
</center>

<p>His interest in the College continued unabated, but our work was soon
modified and then arrested by the war, the buildings being used as a Red Cross
Hospital. As soon as it was possible we reverted to the old conditions. No
further incident calls for special mention; but I cannot close this account of
his relations to the College without adding that, great though his work was for
other sides of denominational life and for the amelioration of misery and the
healing of disease, the work which was more far-reaching in its effects than
anything else was that which he did for the training and equipment of the
ministry.</p>

<p>It is appropriate in this connexion to speak of the help he gave to
ministers by gifts of books or by the arrangements he made to enable them to
purchase books at a greatly reduced price. He presented my first book, <i>A
Guide to Biblical Study</i>, to all Primitive Methodist ministers and offered
at half-price several of my other books. Professor George Adam Smith's <i>The
Historical Geography of the Holy Land</i> was similarly made available for many
who would have found it difficult to purchase it outright. But much more
remarkable was his offer of books up to five guineas at half-price, to be
selected from an elaborate catalogue which I prepared for him. An interesting
point in this connexion was that the figure was lifted from five pounds to five
guineas in order that the complete Hastings' <i>Dictionary of the Bible</i> in
five volumes might be included. It is pleasant to record that the ministers,
whom he had helped in this and in other ways, testified their deep appreciation
of his thoughtful generosity, by the presentation to him of a very beautiful
vase.</p>

<p>Local preachers also were not forgotten. A special catalogue on a smaller
scale was prepared by Mr. H. Jeffs of <i>The Christian World</i>, and myself,
and they were included in the offer of several of my own books; indeed in some
instances Sunday School teachers were also allowed to participate. A friend of
mine who had published an excellent book specially designed to help lay
preachers told me that he was grateful to me for selling out a whole edition of
it. Since so much of the work of the denomination is done by lay preachers and
Sunday School teachers who, often at great cost to themselves, freely give
their labours, it was very fitting that such help should be rendered to them as
well as to the ministers.</p>

<p>In another way he gave substantial assistance to men already in the
ministry. The Summer School was a familiar institution in America for some time
before it was introduced into England. It is now a well-known institution in
this country. The Friends a quarter of a century ago initiated a series for
members of the Society. Politics, economics, social welfare, mathematics and
other subjects have recently followed where theology long before led the way.
The first was held at Mansfield College in 1892, for ministers of all
denominations. Mr. Hartley, seeing the announcement, recognized how valuable
such a course as the School offered might be to the ministers of his own Church
and at once asked me to secure places. He offered to pay half the total cost,
that is for travelling, board and lodging, as well as for the lectures
themselves. The School was international and inter denominational and the list
of lecturers was very brilliant. A second School was held in 1894 with equal
success. In both cases a considerable number of Primitive Methodist ministers
availed themselves of Mr. Hartley's offer. The Mansfield College Summer School
was discontinued, but when Dr. Rendel Harris was President of the National Free
Church Council a Summer School was held in Cambridge. Another Cambridge Summer
School was held at Westminster College, Cambridge. More recently, largely under
the inspiration and guidance of Dr. Estlin Carpenter, a Summer School has been
held at intervals in Oxford. It has been made possible by the help of the
Hibbert trustees. For all of these the same generous assistance was given by
Mr. Hartley and the administrative work connected with them has been
efficiently carried through by the Rev. J. Harryman Taylor. The value of these
gatherings has been very great. They have enabled men whose College days lie in
a rapidly receding past and whose opportunities for study are curtailed by the
incessant demands of pastoral and administrative duties, to hear from experts
about the recent developments in Biblical and theological scholarship and
ascertain what problems are specially engaging attention and in what directions
the pioneers are moving. The lonely minister in rural areas who often has
little money for boots, and perhaps no friend who shares his interests, finds
in that golden fortnight, alike in the stimulus of the lectures and in the
opportunities for informal discussion, a renewal of intellectual energy, a
quickening of his theological interest and a refreshment of spirit in the
strength of which he will journey for many days.</p>

<h3><i>The Support of the Ministry</i></h3>

<p>The support of the ministry in Primitive Methodism is for the most part the
responsibility of the individual circuit. But in some cases it is necessary for
aid to be given from other sources. There are Home Missions Stations under the
direction of the Missionary Committee and largely supported from its funds. In
other cases help is derived from a Sustentation Fund. Naturally as Missionary
Treasurer Mr. Hartley had his part to play in such matters, but this calls for
no special reference. I may, however, quote one incident which is of interest
as showing that he did not wait till consequences forced themselves on his
attention, but anticipated them. After a Welsh strike he wrote on September 14,
1898, to the General Chapel Fund Committee of the denomination, pointing out
that help would be needed for trustees in localities dependent entirely upon
colliery work, and to make up deficiencies in ministers' salaries. He suggested
that the Committee should make a grant and raise a Fund in addition. To this
Fund he promised to add 25 per cent.</p>

<p>Among the difficult problems created for the Churches by the war that of
ministers' salaries was one of the most urgent. It may be well to explain that
the Methodist principle can be summed up in the phrase, "Not payment but
support." When the denomination accepts a man for its ministry, it takes
responsibility for him. He receives his salary, a furnished house when he has
completed his probation, and some help for his children. Everything is on a
very modest scale; indeed the story of the Methodist manse has often been one
of heroic sacrifice and brave unremitting struggle to maintain on inadequate
resources the expected standard. On the other hand the Connexional system
secures a minimum below which a minister's salary is not allowed to fall; and
although there is no maximum which may not be exceeded, the range of inequality
is far less than in communions where the salary is settled by an autonomous
local church.</p>

<p>In all the Churches the strain of rising prices, which had been felt before
the war, was becoming, as the war went on, increasingly severe. The situation
was aggravated by the other difficulties which arose out of the war; the
withdrawal of some of the best workers from weaker societies, and the
impoverishment of many of the most liberal supporters.</p>

<p>The gravity of the situation was creating wide concern before the end of
1917. On November 17 of that year Sir William sent out a circular to 220 laymen
inviting contributions to a fund from which an addition of 25 per cent. might,
within certain limits, be granted on any increase of salaries circuits might
make. The letter ran as follows.</p>

<blockquote><i>November 17, 1917.</i><br>
<br>
 <i>Primitive Methodist Ministers' Salaries.</i><br>
<br>
 Dear Sir,--<br>
<br>
 Probably you will have seen the correspondence on this subject in the
<i>Leader</i>, and also the leading article in the <i>British Weekly</i>. The
question has been on my mind for some time past, and I feel that for the honour
of our Church, and the efficiency and well-being of our Ministers, it is
essential that something should be done to increase the salaries. The present
purchasing power of money is probably only about 50 per cent. of the pre-war
value. Under these conditions I think you will agree that each married
Minister's Salary should, if possible, be increased to at least &pound;150 a
year, and Probationers' to &pound;90.<br>
<br>
 The suggestion is--that a Connexional Fund be raised by contributions from our
leading laymen, and to induce the circuits to take the matter up, a challenge
offer would be made from this fund of 25 per cent. on any increase in salary
they may make within the limits named above, for a period of three years. Only
those circuits that raised their proportion would come under the scheme.<br>
<br>
 <i>Example.</i>--If a circuit should decide to increase the minister's salary
by say &pound;20 a year--&pound;5 would be provided by this fund, and &pound;15
by the circuit, and <i>pro rata</i>, whether more or less.<br>
<br>
 It is estimated that this challenge offer would require a special fund of
&pound;7,500 in addition to the amount provided by the circuits. If half this
sum is promised, I will give a like amount, and thereby provide the
&pound;7,500. I hope you will assist this humanitarian effort, which, if
successful, will bring great joy to hundreds of homes, where at present there
must be severe privation, if not absolute debt.<br>
<br>
 It is suggested that promises be paid in three annual donations, the first
instalment in February, 1918, and each February during the three years, so as
to be in time for payment to each March Quarterly Meetings.<br>
<br>
 The scheme has the approval of the General Committee and the Secretary hopes
to communicate with all the circuits in time for consideration by the December
Quarterly Meetings.<br>
<br>
 I trust to receive your early and favourable reply.<br>
<br>
 Yours truly,<br>
<br>
 W. P. Hartley.</blockquote>

<p>The appeal brought in more than the amount suggested and it seemed probable
that this amount would prove to be considerably in excess of that required. It
was accordingly proposed that the surplus should be used to augment the fund
which was being raised to help those ministers whose circuits were unable to
pay more than the minimum salary.</p>

<p>When a Primitive Methodist minister retires from active service his
superannuation allowance is derived partly from the Superannuated Ministers,
Widows and Orphans' Fund and partly from the Preachers' Friendly Society. The
allowance from the two sources combined is slender, and few ministers are able
to save much out of their salaries for old age, or to provide for those who are
dependent upon them. This class was accordingly hit very hard by the
depreciation in the value of money. On the initiative of some outstanding
laymen at Northampton a Lightning Fund of &pound;20,000 was raised in a few
weeks. This was a movement very much to Sir William's mind and specially
welcome because it had originated quite independently of any suggestion of his
own. He was, in fact, rather troubled by the fact that the denomination had
come to look so much for his leadership, and greatly wished that others would
come forward to initiate new schemes.</p>

<p>An even more important movement for the same object was soon after set on
foot. For several years the condition of the Preachers' Friendly Society had
occasioned no little anxiety. When the Society came into existence too little
was known of the conditions which had to be observed if the fund was to be
maintained in a healthy state. For some time the premiums paid were too small
and the payments too large. Steps had been taken to mitigate the evil, but the
Society was, in the judgment of actuarial experts, unsound. It was clear that
sooner or later something drastic would be necessary. And it would have to be
done by the Church itself. It was an act of bare justice to those who had spent
all their strength in its service. The possibilities of Methodist Union were
becoming all the time more prominent, and although the financial position of
the Primitive Methodist Church was placed in an altogether too unfavourable a
light by some opponents of Union in a way which Primitive Methodists resented
as unworthy and unjust, the condition of the Preachers' Friendly Society was
not one of which any Primitive Methodist could feel proud. It would certainly
have been much fairer if the opponents of Union had recognized the truly
amazing efforts which the denomination had made, and instead of emphasizing its
financial liabilities had been more generous in its recognition of the speed
with which they were being liquidated. Nevertheless the Friendly Society was a
weak point which had to be made good. At this juncture the General Secretary of
the denomination received a letter from a writer who wished his name not to be
disclosed. He offered &pound;10,000 towards the sum required for the purpose. I
well remember how Sir William reported to his minister, the Rev. H. J. Pickett,
and myself, as we were walking from church, the receipt of a letter from the
General Secretary informing him of the offer. We were not quite sure at first
whether he was not himself responsible for the mystification. He divined what
we were thinking and quickly assured us that he was not the anonymous donor. He
proceeded to speculate on his identity, leaning to the correct solution. At the
following Conference it leaked out that the donor was Mr. Clapham, of Yarm, and
he was requested to address the assembly. In that address he said that the
example of Sir William Hartley had been one which had greatly influenced him.
It was pleasant to see it bearing such precious fruit. The Conference decided
that a committee of laymen should be appointed to raise a fund of
&pound;60,000. Some of the leading laymen in the denomination--Sir Thomas
Robinson, Mr. William Arnold, Mr. Moses Bourne, Mr. Joseph Longstaff--gave
themselves without stint to the task of advocating the claims of the Fund. Up
to this point of his career Sir William had not displayed any special interest
in the Preachers' Friendly Society. But he promised a conditional donation of
&pound;10,000, and this, too, was an anonymous offer. It was not surprising
that he made it anonymous. It was a measure for self-protection. Whenever any
large donation of his to a religious object was announced, he was sure to
receive a number of anonymous letters, admitting perhaps that the object was a
good one, but asserting that it would have been much better if he had given the
money to his employees. Undoubtedly he gave as much thought to the distribution
of his money as any of his anonymous censors, and none strove harder to
enlighten and then to follow his conscience. And it does not appear whether
they had considered the question how the action they exhorted him to take would
have been viewed by his competitors; or whether they would themselves approve
the application of a parallel principle if taken by a worker. These unpleasant
letters worried him, and he had said to me some time before that he must, to
save himself from them, resort to anonymity.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to record that the money was duly raised and Sir William's
promise was duly claimed. But Methodism is served by a great army of lay
preachers, and they too have claims on the generosity of the Church. Often they
are working-men, earning, especially in the agricultural districts, a scanty
wage. They do their work as local preachers without fee, often tramping long
distances in all weathers and sacrificing the rest which a hard week's toil has
amply earned. Mr. Hartley, for reasons already given, did not belong to their
order. But he had great sympathy with them and admiration for their work. I
have elsewhere spoken of what he did for them by the gift of books. I might add
that in connexion with the Local Preachers' Training Fund he offered at the
Conference of 1907 that if each Circuit would contribute the five shillings
expected from them he would add a donation of &pound;100 in order to prosecute
the work to a greater extent. He confirmed this in a letter to Professor
Humphries on June 24, 1907. For many years Professor Humphries did a very
valuable service to the cause of local preacher training; and this, together
with his long and faithful service at Hartley College, was fittingly recognized
by his designation as President of the Conference to be held at Manchester in
June, 1926.</p>

<p>How keenly Mr. Hartley felt the obligation that rested on the denomination
to provide for its needy local preachers will be clear from a letter he wrote
to the <i>Primitive Methodist</i> on June 24, 1893.</p>

<blockquote>"It has several times been stated recently in Conference and
elsewhere that there were local preachers and officials of long standing in
various parts of the Connexion in needy circumstances. To myself, and I dare
say to many others, this statement has given surprise and pain.<br>
<br>
 "The claim of such persons is, I think, first of all upon the circuit that has
profited by their labours. I hold with Dr. Chalmers that every Church should
provide for its own poor. Prosperous circuits in manufacturing districts ought
to have a fund of their own adequate to this purpose. But there are poor and
struggling circuits in agricultural districts that need outside help, and such
help I am prepared during the next year to render.<br>
<br>
 "The claims of my business render it impossible for me to undertake the work
of investigation which will necessarily be involved. This must be done by the
circuit authorities. First let the local fund be started, then submit any cases
needing help to the Quarterly Meeting. If deemed deserving, a brief statement
of each case, with the minute passed hereon by the Quarterly Meeting should be
forwarded, accompanied by a short statement of the circumstances of the
circuit.<br>
<br>
 "When these conditions are complied with and it is shown that the circuit is
not in a position to give all the help needed, I am prepared to render
financial assistance to a reasonable extent, and thus supplement the amount
raised on the spot."</blockquote>

<h2><a name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3><i>Temperance</i></h3>

<p>There was from the first a very strong temperance sentiment among the
Primitive Methodists. Hugh Bourne, one of the founders, was a teetotaller
before the seven men of Preston and in the benighted period when total
abstinence was generally regarded as a displeasing and unsocial eccentricity.
It was natural that a Church which had grown out of an evangelistic movement
should more and more range itself on the side of total abstinence, for its
converts were often reclaimed drunkards, and drink was preeminently the enemy
which it was constantly compelled to fight. And this favoured a rapid spread of
total abstinence principles. Arm-chair moralists are inclined to handle the
question in the abstract, and fail to understand the forces which necessitate a
practice that they regard as extreme. But those who are devoting their lives to
the grim struggle with vice soon learn that they are immeasurably weakened in
their appeals for sobriety if they are not themselves total abstainers.</p>

<p>It was natural that Mr. Hartley, as a Primitive Methodist of the third
generation and born into a family steeped in its Puritan tradition, should be
firm in his adherence to the more rigid standard. He was personally a life-long
abstainer. At the profit-sharing in January, 1910, urging his workpeople to use
the money distributed to the very best advantage, he said that he and his wife
were life-long teetotallers; he believed that he was within the truth when he
said that they had never tasted beer or spirits in their lives. The man or
woman who indulged in either liquor or gambling was only courting poverty and
sorrow. Accordingly when he entreated his people, as at the distribution of
profits he constantly did, to spend none of the money in intoxicants, his
exhortation had behind it the weight of his settled conviction and his personal
example. On these occasions he would express his willingness to help any of his
people who were in trouble; but he limited this by the proviso that they should
not have brought their misfortunes on themselves by intemperance. "I have no
sympathy," he affirmed, "with drink in any shape or form."</p>

<p>Writing in reply to a request to help a temperance organization, he said in
a letter dated October 14, 1908: "I need not say that all at Sea View are total
abstainers and that we are helping the work in many large and important ways.
For instance, I gave a cheque in June of this year for &pound;500 to help the
funds of the United Kingdom Alliance and another for &pound;500 to Sir Thomas
Whittaker for the same purpose."</p>

<p>He was a Vice-President of the British Temperance League. But one of the
causes in which he took special interest was the training of the young in
temperance principles. For three years he contributed &pound;310 annually
towards the cost of temperance teaching in the Liverpool Schools. He was a
generous supporter of the Lancashire and Cheshire Band of Hope Union, of which
his son-in-law, Mr. J. S. Higham, has for long been the treasurer. He presided
at the annual meeting in February, 1909. In his address he said that he was
present to show his deep interest in the temperance work, but especially in the
teaching of temperance in the day schools. The surest way to attain their end
was to place the scientific treatment of temperance before young people in the
day schools throughout the country. Temperance teaching in the day schools was
now optional in the curriculum, but he hoped it might be made compulsory before
very long. It had been stated that in America there were twenty-two million
children receiving that kind of education. But until that happy day arrived in
this country they must put forth every effort in their power to provide that
scientific teaching in which they had so much confidence. He called special
attention to <i>Alcohol and the Human Body</i>, which had recently been
published by Sir Victor Horsley and Dr. Mary Sturge. Describing it as a book of
immense value, he said that he so fully recognized the supreme importance of
such a book getting into the right hands that he had arranged for a special
edition to be prepared with the intention of presenting a copy to each
recognized speaker belonging to the Lancashire and Cheshire Band of Hope Union
and each recognized speaker of the national Band of Hope Union. He had also
arranged for a copy to be placed in the hands of each minister of all sections
of the Methodist Church who was in active service. Altogether the special
edition would probably amount to 18,000 copies. He was sure that the perusal of
the book by such an army of public speakers would result in great good to the
cause they had so much at heart.</p>

<p>As was not unusual, his plans developed, and in the distribution of the book
he went far beyond what he had originally contemplated. He included ministers
of other than the Methodist Churches, both Anglican and Free Church, so that
the total number of copies distributed was about 40,000.</p>

<p>He served the cause in other ways. The cafe and institute which he built at
Aintree, and to which reference is made elsewhere, had for one of its objects
to provide a counter-attraction to the public-house. Another instance is not
without a touch of humour. When the Licensing Bill was before the country many
brewers resented the active support given to it by the Bishops and clergy of
the Church of England and announced that they would withdraw the financial help
they had previously given to their work. Sir William promptly forwarded a
cheque for &pound;500 to Dr. Chavasse, the Bishop of Liverpool, to distribute
among the various diocesan funds. The repartee was greatly enjoyed by the
friends of sobriety and all who resented the action of the brewers and its
implications; while the widespread interest which the incident excited had a
moral effect more valuable than the financial aid rendered by the gift.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>In the address delivered at the profit-sharing of 1910, already quoted, Sir
William coupled gambling with drinking as the prolific source of poverty and
sorrow. In the same context he said, referring to himself and Lady Hartley,
that as for gambling, they never thought of it even for a sixpence. How deeply
he felt on the subject is clear from his protest against raffling at bazaars.
In connexion with a Liberal Bazaar which he had been asked to help, he wrote a
letter on March 8, 1907, in which, after referring to a conversation with two
friends on the project, he continues: "I also explained to them that I was
entirely out of sympathy with any form of raffling or means in which the
element of chance was brought in. Ever since I can remember I have heard it
preached against, and I and my family have never had anything to do with a
bazaar in which raffling was introduced. When I noticed this matter in the
<i>Southport Guardian</i> I was very much astonished, indeed I had the greatest
of difficulty to believe it, hence my reason for writing you to ask if it was
so. I regret I don't see my way to modify my opinion. I was very firm in the
expression of my view to the deputation, and since then I and my family have
talked the matter over several times and have always come to the same
conclusion, therefore I regret I cannot take any part in the present appeal
either direct or indirect."</p>

<p>On July 8 he wrote to one of the two friends previously mentioned as
follows: "It gives me pleasure to promise a donation of &pound;250 towards the
forthcoming Liberal Bazaar in October, and I will send you my cheque at that
time. I am glad that the raffling has been done away with. I am also sorry that
it was ever attempted, and even more sorry that it was not thrown over at a
much earlier period."</p>

<h3><i>Hospitals</i></h3>

<p>No form of philanthropic activity appealed to Mr. Hartley more than the
relief of pain and the healing of disease, and it was natural that this should
find its chief expression in the provision of hospitals. For here his
philanthropic instinct was linked with his interest in building and his sense
of the valuable results to be expected from scientific research. But he was
deeply concerned for the support of institutions already in existence. He was
characteristically liberal in his personal contributions and he stimulated the
gifts of others by adding in many instances an equivalent amount. It was in
fact by no means uncommon for him to double the collection made on Hospital
Sunday in Churches with which he was connected or in which he had some
interest. He financed research on the cause and cure of cancer at the
University of Liverpool, and he was also keenly interested in its School of
Tropical Medicine--all the more so because of its importance for missionary
work.</p>

<p>One of the first of his larger contributions was occasioned by an accident
to his youngest daughter, which occurred in the very week when he left
Southport to live at Aintree. I quote his own account of it.</p>

<blockquote>"On Sunday, October 26, 1890, it was a wild morning and we were
driving to Cambridge Hall, Southport, in a cab, this being our last Sunday in
Southport, and going down Alma Road, Birkdale, the cab door flew open and
Constance fell out. I sprang out in a moment, expecting she would be lamed or
killed on the stone pavement, as the cab was going at a good speed: and to my
glad surprise she was scarcely hurt at all. A policeman who saw the accident
said the wheel went within an inch of her head and the deliverance was a
miracle. I never felt so thankful before, as nothing short of a providence
could have saved her, either from being hurt on the hard pavement or perhaps
killed with the wheel."</blockquote>

<p>As a thankoffering he endowed a bed at the Children's Infirmary in Liverpool
at the cost of &pound;500, and the story is told on a brass plate affixed to
it.</p>

<p>One of the tasks which specially appealed to him was the battle with
consumption. When the foundation-stone of the Cottage Hospital was laid at
Colne on April 1, 1899, Mr. Hartley said in his address that he was glad to
know that consumption was curable. He had an interview along with a deputation
with Sir William Broadbent in London two months earlier; and he said that given
rest, abundant food, and life in the open air, even the dread disease of
consumption was curable. Believing this to be true they were arranging in
Liverpool to erect a Sanatorium for the care of poor people threatened with
consumption and they hoped in twelve months to have it in order.</p>

<p>The Sanatorium, to which reference is made, was erected at Delamere. Lady
Willox, whose husband had at one time been Editor of the <i>Liverpool
Courier</i>, shared in this work with Mr. Hartley, and in 1902 the buildings
were handed over to the Committee to form part of the work of the Liverpool
Consumption Hospital. The total cost was &pound;15,000 and it was borne equally
by the two donors.</p>

<p>Prolonged experience and deepened study of the subject convinced him that
the problem was a vast one far beyond the capacity of individual benevolence.
Speaking in Liverpool in November, 1908, he said that the more he looked into
the matter the more he felt that the prevention and cure of consumption should
be a national question, and until that time arrived he thought the great
municipalities should take it up. "I have for years felt strongly," he
continued, "that it is a disgrace to our civilization and our religion that
respectable men and women should be allowed to die of consumption simply for
the want of financial assistance, which it should be our duty and our pleasure
to supply."</p>

<p>The radical mistake which vitiated so much of their efforts and compelled
them to stop short at palliatives when they might have obtained cures, was that
the cases were taken in hand too late. For the patients, owing to financial
necessities, struggled on while the disease was striking deeper and deeper
roots, and when they were driven to seek proper treatment it was too firmly
established to be eradicable. His own view of the subject is admirably
expressed in a letter he wrote on October 20, 1908.</p>

<blockquote>"I have given great thought to this matter for the last three or
four years, and I can see plainly that what is wanted is a large sum of money
that would admit working men and women threatened with consumption at a fee of
only 10s. per week, and even then in scores of cases the poor people would have
the greatest difficulty to find the money, because not only is the fee to find
for the Sanatorium, but the person's family is to be considered during the
time. A very great number of lives could be saved and much suffering avoided
providing that there was enough money forthcoming either from public or private
sources.<br>
<br>
 "This is such a great question and so far-reaching all over the country that
it ought to be either a national or a municipal matter! It is really too great
a matter for ordinary benevolence, because if the money could be arranged it
ought to be publicly known that persons suffering from consumption could have
sanatorium treatment at a very low fee, whereas as it is, persons go on working
three months or six months too long until in many cases the mischief is
done."</blockquote>

<p>He took a great interest in the Royal Infirmary at Manchester, which was
opened by King Edward the Seventh. He endowed five beds in 1908 and five in
1909, at a cost of about &pound;6,000.</p>

<p>His most notable gifts of the kind were made to Colne. The decision to
present a Cottage Hospital to his native town was accidental. On May 13, 1897,
a town's meeting was held to consider and determine the way in which the
Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria should be commemorated. Among the suggestions
put forward was one for the erection of technical schools, but this was
rejected in favour of the provision of a Cottage Hospital. Mr. Hartley, who
after he had left Colne kept in touch with it by reading its newspaper, saw a
report of the meeting and on May 18 wrote the following letter to the
Mayor.</p>

<blockquote>"I am willing to provide the money to build and furnish a Cottage
Hospital for Colne; the cost of land and building to be about three thousand
pounds. I have a site of freehold land on Keighley Road, which cost between
&pound;700 and &pound;800, and I think a good plain building could be erected
and furnished for about &pound;3,000 including the land. I offer this on the
following terms, viz. that the people of Colne and neighbourhood subscribe a
similar amount for an endowment fund, not necessarily to be a perpetual
endowment, but if the Council so desires, the endowment could be limited to
twenty years, the principal and interest might be totally expended in the
twenty years.<br>
<br>
 "On this basis each thousand pounds would bring in about &pound;66 a year, so
that &pound;3,000 would give about &pound;200 a year for twenty years.<br>
<br>
 "A committee elected by the donors should go into the whole question and take
advice from various places where Cottage Hospitals have been successfully
worked, and if they find it needful to spend more than &pound;3,000 on land,
buildings and furnishing, I am willing to go to &pound;3,500 or even
&pound;4,000, with only one condition, viz., that a similar amount be
subscribed by the public towards the endowment."</blockquote>

<p>The Mayor's comment at the meeting of the Council was that this was a most
noble and generous offer, the most generous they had ever had in Colne; and he
was pleased they had a Colne man who was able and willing to do such a thing.
When the foundation-stone was laid by Mr. Hartley, on April 1, 1899, he
increased his offer to &pound;5,000. The actual cost of the land, the hospital
itself, its furnishing and equipment was &pound;4,595. The hospital, which is
situated in Barrowford Road, was designed by Mr. Henry Holgate of Colne, and it
provided accommodation for fourteen patients. It was opened by the late Earl of
Derby, on Saturday, April 20, 1900. Soon after that date the endowment fund was
completed. The first patient was admitted in June, 1900, and the total number
of patients treated in the hospital has exceeded 4,600.</p>

<p>By 1910 the Cottage Hospital had become inadequate for the needs of the
district. Schemes were suggested for its enlargement, Sir William offering to
defray the cost if conditions similar to those previously imposed were
fulfilled. But he became convinced that something on a much larger scale was
required, and in 1914 offered to provide an entirely new hospital which should
be sufficient for the district and be completely equipped with the latest
appliances. He estimated the cost as &pound;25,000. His condition was that a
sufficient annual income should be guaranteed. He suggested a weekly
contributory scheme, a method of which he had long been in favour. Early in the
century he had proposed at a profit-sharing that his workpeople should
institute a weekly collection for the Liverpool hospitals. He promised that he
would contribute an equal amount and the suggestion had been accepted in the
form that one penny a week was deducted from the men's wages and one halfpenny
a week from the women's wages. Speaking to his work people when the scheme had
been in operation for five years he pointed out that a very large sum could be
collected for the hospitals, not only in Liverpool but in every town in the
country if the weekly system were adopted. He regarded it as much the easiest
plan. He said that the best example he knew was Leicester, where the workpeople
in the factories, workshops and shops contributed no less than about
&pound;11,000 a year, being much more than double the amount contributed by the
ordinary annual subscribers. Accordingly in December, 1914, representatives of
the six largest trade organizations in Colne visited Leicester on his
invitation. The scheme was in operation in connexion with the Leicester and
county infirmary and convalescent homes. The deputation found the workers and
trade organizations in the Leicester district "whole-heartedly in favour of the
weekly contributory scheme and proud of its success." Their own conclusion was
stated in the following terms: "We are so convinced of the soundness of such a
scheme that we severally and collectively are willing to recommend our members
to adopt the same for Colne and will do what we can for the success of the
movement if it is started."</p>

<p>The war, however, prevented any further progress with the scheme. Mr.
Hartley consulted the Treasury as to his duty and was requested not to proceed
with the work but to delay it till the war was ended. A site was selected in
Keighley Road, adjoining the Hartley Homes, and plans were prepared, but of the
work itself nothing could be done. On November 19, 1918, eight days after the
Armistice, Sir William visited Colne to meet the Committee. He explained that
he was prepared to go forward with the building and impressed upon the
Committee the need of initiating the weekly contributory scheme. A town's
meeting was held on January 21, 1919, attended by Mr. Wooley, the organizing
secretary of the Leicester scheme, and a resolution was adopted approving of a
similar scheme for Colne. In March Mr. J. E. Keighley was appointed to organize
it, and it has received steadily increasing support.</p>

<p>Meanwhile conditions had changed enormously for the worse and Sir William
had to face the very serious fact that the building and equipment, which before
the war were estimated to cost about &pound;25,000, would now cost about
&pound;100,000, an estimate which proved to be accurate. In spite of a heavy
possible commitment at Liverpool he decided to proceed with his promise to
Colne. Messrs. Holgate and Spivey of Colne were appointed the architects, and
the Medical Superintendent of the Western Infirmary, Glasgow, Colonel
Mackintosh, a leading expert on hospital construction, was retained as
consultant.</p>

<p>The plot bought as the site of the hospital was four and a half acres in
extent and it had a frontage of 527 feet. It rose in a steep gradient and
thousands of cubic yards of soil had to be removed before the foundations could
be laid. The buildings lie about a hundred feet from the road, and terraces,
constructed from the excavated soil, rising one above the other, fill the space
between the road and the hospital itself. Owing to the nature of the ground the
building is exceptionally long in its frontage; and this has the additional
advantage that the most is made of the south aspect. The women's ward has
accommodation for sixteen beds, the children's for eight and the men's for
twelve. There are in addition four private wards. The intention of the donors
that the latest appliances devised by medical or surgical science should be
provided, and that the most advanced ideas in hospital construction should be
incorporated in the buildings, has been amply fulfilled. The visitor is
specially impressed by this when he examines the section of the hospital
devoted to operations. This contains the operating theatre itself, the
sterilizing room, an X-ray room, a dark room and a surgical store. A feature
which will be quite new to most visitors is the "Scialytic" light suspended
over the operating table. The peculiar feature of this light is that it
eliminates shadows. But what is true of the operating block is true of the
whole building. It is "the last word" in hospital construction and
equipment.</p>

<p>The foundation-stone was laid on Saturday, September 3, 1921. It was a most
impressive ceremony. There was a great procession through the town and a large
gathering of spectators witnessed the proceedings. It had been the wish of Sir
William to secure a distinguished visitor to lay the foundation-stone, but the
Committee firmly insisted that no one but the donor himself should perform the
ceremony. In the speech he delivered he laid special stress on the measures
which had been taken to ensure adequate financial support. He said: "The
pleasure is all the greater because the financial position of the hospital will
be assured by the weekly contributions of the working people assisted by annual
subscription. Hospitals all over the country are finding the utmost difficulty
in raising money for their upkeep, and during the last few months there have
been frequent references in the Press of the country to the serious position of
Hospital finance. You have met the difficulty here in Colne in the only
practical manner in which it could be met--that is by your contributory
scheme--and I congratulate my native town and neighbourhood on rising to a true
conception of its responsibility. There is a great clamour, as you know, from
many quarters for State assistance, but I am more pleased than I can express
that you intend to run the hospital yourselves and not go cap in hand to the
State. You can rely upon my promise that everything known to medical science
will be provided in it and that nothing will be left undone to make it complete
and up-to-date in every particular."</p>

<p>The interest which Sir William took in the progress of the building was
unabated, but he was not spared to see its completion, since his death occurred
in less than fourteen months after he had laid the foundation-stone. But the
work went on and the opening ceremony took place on Saturday, June 21, 1924.
The weather was less favourable for the procession, but it improved before the
actual ceremony took place. It was eminently fitting that Miss Hartley, who had
recently been Mayor of Southport, should take her father's place. Her task was
singularly difficult and imposed upon her a great emotional strain, but her
address was as admirable in its conception as it was felicitous in its
expression.</p>

<p>A scheme to which he gave prolonged thought, and for which he made extensive
preparations, was planned in recognition of an urgent need. Some time before
the war he had determined to build a Maternity Hospital for Liverpool. Knowing
the increasing difficulty of obtaining land, he took immense trouble to examine
all available and possible sites in the heart of Liverpool, and finally, after
a consultation with the best authorities, the position was chosen and part of
the land was secured by the Maternity Hospital authorities. To complete the
site, to enlarge it, and to give it a really commanding position, Sir William,
by negotiating with the Corporation and by buying other properties and land at
a cost of about &pound;5,000, made available perhaps the finest site that could
be found in Liverpool; and the Maternity Hospital Committee probably owe to his
perspicacity and business sagacity the plot of land upon which they are now
building a great Maternity Hospital. Sir William presented this land to the
proper authority, and set aside &pound;25,000 in cash as his donation towards
the building. He would have completed the whole scheme himself ten years ago,
and according to the plan which he mentioned to me it would have been opened in
connexion with his Golden Wedding, if the War had not broken out and the
Chancellor of the Exchequer had not, in consequence of the necessities of the
national situation, placed his veto upon building.</p>

<p>Another great gift was in commemoration of his seventieth birthday. It was
announced at the London profit-sharing in March, 1916. He said that the public
both in Liverpool and London had shown great confidence in the firm and bought
its goods in increasing quantities every year. He felt that the public had
behaved handsomely and earned their gratitude. He and his son had accordingly
considered together most anxiously for months--not weeks but months--how they
could repay their debt to the public, and they had decided that they could not
do better than by doing something for the hospitals. After careful and
prolonged consideration he had decided to transfer &pound;10,000 from his
investment in 4-1/2 per cent. War Loan to twenty-two London hospitals. After he
had given a list of these, with the sums allotted to each, he added that the
firm had been in Liverpool forty-two years, and that city could not be left
out, and to it he had allotted &pound;5,000.</p>

<p>This is the most convenient place to mention that on the same occasion he
allotted &pound;5,000 to the Charities of the trades which acted as
intermediaries in the sale of their goods. With the sum of &pound;10,000
transferred, as is related elsewhere, to the Pension Fund for his workpeople,
his total War Loan investment of &pound;30,000 was exhausted.</p>

<h3><i>Almshouse and Orphanage</i></h3>

<p>One of the most splendid gifts of Sir William and Lady Hartley to their
native town was that of the Hartley Homes. These were actually presented to the
Borough in October, 1911. But this was only the consummation of a
long-cherished design as is clear from the statement made on that occasion by
Sir William. He said: "Lady Hartley and I have had the erection of almshouses
in contemplation for twenty years. I think it is fifteen years since we bought
land for this purpose on the Keighley Road, nearly opposite the Horsfield
Cottage. The explanation of the long delay in the erection of the almshouses is
that it was felt in the town many years ago that a Cottage Hospital was really
a necessity, and for a time this postponed the erection of the almshouses. It
was on the strong recommendation of my friend Mr. Smith, the Deputy Mayor, that
we discarded the original site nearer the town and substituted the present one.
This is much larger and much superior in every way, and has enabled us to erect
many more homes than we originally contemplated, or would have been possible on
the old site."</p>

<center>
<p><a name="il-11"></a><img alt="" src="0701091h-images/0701091h-11.jpg"></p>
</center>

<p>It had been originally intended to provide eight Cottage Homes, but the
abandonment of the site first selected for the purpose and the purchase of the
larger site made it possible to erect twenty Homes. The total cost was
&pound;13,000. The Homes stand on a plot of land measuring an acre and a half,
adjoining the plot on which the Hartley Hospital was subsequently erected. They
command a glorious prospect and, beautiful themselves, they are surrounded by
beautiful grounds. They are arranged in three sides of a quadrangle, the fourth
side being left open. Eight of the homes, divided by an imposing clock tower
into groups of four, face south, the long extension thus giving the maximum
exposure to the sun, and this is flanked by six at either end, running at right
angles to the long line of eight homes. The nature of the site, which rose
sharply from the road, made similar treatment necessary to that subsequently
applied to the site of the Hartley Hospital in the adjoining plot. The space
between the central building and the road is laid out in terraces.</p>

<p>Speaking at Colne in November, 1909, when the project was still in its
initial stages, Sir William expressed his intention to present the Homes to the
Town Council "together with such a sum of money as will provide in perpetuity
for the upkeep, for the ground rents, for the gardener, for the rates, and for
the expenses generally." As to the qualifications for occupancy, he said that
the applicants must be of the age required to claim the Government old age
pension. Besides natives of Colne who were resident in the town there might be
others, now living perhaps at Nelson or Burnley, who might desire to spend
their closing years in their native town. Such would, in his opinion, be very
suitable applicants. "So far as I see at present," he added, "the Colne Town
Council will be the governing authority, and their decision as to who shall be
appointed to live in the houses will be final." When the houses were handed
over, an endowment sufficient to bring in an income of &pound;150 a year for
all time was settled upon them.</p>

<p>When the time came for the property to be transferred, the gates were opened
by Sir George Pilkington, the High Sheriff of Lancashire. The documents
conveying the homes to the Town Council were presented to the Mayor by Sir
William. He said: "It will be a pleasure, Mr. Mayor, to Lady Hartley and myself
and my family, to know that many old and deserving people of our native town
will be able to pass the remainder of their days amidst such bright and
beautiful and comfortable surroundings. It is a real pleasure to me, one of the
greatest pleasures of my life, to present to you the Trust Deeds of the
'Hartley Homes' and all the papers in connexion therewith."</p>

<p>In his reply the Mayor stated that the Homes were primarily intended for the
people of Colne who were in receipt of, or entitled to old age pensions; but
the trust deeds had been framed with such elasticity as to widen the range of
beneficiaries so as to secure at all times the full number of tenants and the
admission of specially deserving persons, with any attendants they might
need.</p>

<p>The property is vested in trustees and it is controlled and managed by
sixteen governors. The Mayor is <i>ex officio</i> a governor, there are nine
life-governors, of whom three must be women, and six representative governors
appointed for terms of five years by the Town Council, two of whom must be
women. The place accorded to women conforms to Sir William's own desire. In the
address he gave in November, 1909, he said: "My present idea, subject to the
Council, is that one third of the management committee should be women. I dare
say in a short time there will be ladies on the Colne Town Council. I could
vote for that myself."</p>

<p>The care for the aged, exhibited in the Hartley Homes, was fitly matched by
the provision he made for the young. The Primitive Methodists had an Orphan
Home at Arlesford. This proved successful, and as further accommodation was
required, Sir William and Lady Hartley came forward to meet the need. In 1907
he invited a tender for one pair of homes and another tender for two pairs. He
was informed that only one pair was required, and this was opened at Harrogate
during the year which ended June, 1909. Shortly before the Conference of that
year he ascertained that the second pair was needed, and he and his wife
offered during the Conference, of which he was President, to build and furnish
the two homes. Each pair provided accommodation for twenty-four children.</p>

<p>Spurgeon gained a fame by his Orphanage in circles which were not reached by
his sermons; and a burglar who had once robbed him restored the stolen property
when he found that it had been taken from "the horflins' Spurgeon." The famous
preacher, in a striking variation on Elijah's challenge to the priests of
Melkart, once said, "The God that answereth by orphanages, let him be God." Sir
William might well have adapted it in a fuller form: "The God that answereth by
hospital, by almshouse, by orphanage, let him be God."</p>

<h3><i>Public Life</i></h3>

<p>With the heavy duties and responsibilities involved in the care and
extension of his business, in his work for the Church and his expenditure of
time as well as money on service to uplift his fellow-creatures and ameliorate
their lot, it would not have been surprising if Mr. Hartley had found no
leisure for public service. And it is true that such activity played a very
subordinate part in his crowded career. Still he took some share in municipal
and political life. In 1893 he was appointed a Justice of the Peace for the
county of Lancaster, and sat at the Courts in the Kirkdale division of
Lancashire. On January 14, 1895, he was elected on the Walton School Board.
From 1895 to 1898 he was a member of the Liverpool City Council. For a year he
served on the Health Committee, and on his suggestion this Committee abolished
the 4-feet back passages, and substituted the 9-feet back streets. The late
Lord Derby was then Lord Mayor. An invitation which greatly appealed to him was
that he should accept the Mayoralty of Colne. This came to him in 1919, when he
was seventy-three years of age. In view of the fact that he was a native of
Colne, that he had presented to his birthplace the Cottage Hospital and the
Hartley Homes and was preparing to build the new hospital, the invitation was
very fitting. Moreover he had become an Honorary Freeman of Colne in 1909. He
carefully considered and took medical advice on the suggestion. He regretfully
declined it because the medical verdict was adverse and because his residence
was too far away. He told me at the time that the Town Council had offered to
make the duties as light as possible so as to facilitate his acceptance. But he
had felt that he could not accept an office the duties of which he could not
adequately fulfil. Undoubtedly he did wisely to refuse, but naturally he felt
very deeply the call from his native town to which he was so profoundly
attached. He was knighted by King Edward VII on July 21, 1908, and he was
presented to King George V and Queen Mary when they visited Southport in
1913.</p>

<p>Few distinctions which Sir William received were more highly valued than his
admission to the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Colne. On Wednesday, July
28, 1909, the Mayor, Councillor John Smith, introduced the following resolution
at a meeting of the Town Council which had been passed by the General Purposes
Committee:</p>

<blockquote>"That in the opinion of the Committee of the Town Council it is the
most fitting opportunity to place on record its appreciation of the high esteem
in which Sir William Hartley, of Aintree, is held by the inhabitants of his
native town; and in recognition of the many valuable services rendered by Sir
William to the Borough, as well as to the community at large, that he should be
created a Freeman of the Borough, and that the usual formalities required by
the Municipal Corporations Act be complied with."</blockquote>

<p>In proposing the resolution the Mayor spoke as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"I felt I was only voicing the thoughts of the inhabitants of Colne
when I asked Sir William if he would accept this honour in my interview with
him on the 30th of June. I was better pleased with his reply that he left the
matter entirely in our hands, and said that if we thought fit to confer upon
him the Freedom of the Town, he would be pleased to accept it; but what he had
done for his country, and for his native town in particular, had been done
because he considered it his duty and not for any gain or reward in any shape
whatever. Without saying any thing further, I am proud that we, in Colne, can
claim such a gentleman as a native, and my only desire is that he may have
health and strength for many years yet, so that he will be able to enjoy the
fruits of his good works."</blockquote>

<p>At a special meeting of the Town Council the following resolution was moved
by the Mayor and seconded by Alderman R. Foulds.</p>

<blockquote>"Resolved<br>
<br>
 "That this Council desires to place on record the high esteem in which Sir
William Hartley of Aintree is held by the inhabitants of his native town and to
recognize the many valuable services rendered by Sir William to the Borough as
well as to the community at large.<br>
<br>
 "In the year 1900 Sir William erected and presented to the Borough the Jubilee
Cottage Hospital, an Institution which is daily administering relief and
affording comfort to the sick and injured of the Borough and District, and as a
further manifestation of his kindly consideration of the old and infirm, Sir
William is at the present time engaged in the arrangements for the erection, in
the Borough, of a group of twenty Cottage Homes, to be used as residence for
the aged poor of the district.<br>
<br>
 "This Council also offers to Sir William its most sincere congratulations on
his elevation to the dignity of Knighthood, an honour and distinction His
Majesty King Edward has been graciously pleased to confer, in recognition of
the many princely acts of beneficence and philanthropy rendered by Sir William
to his country.<br>
<br>
 "The Council further recognizes with extreme pleasure that during the present
year the Primitive Methodist Church, in annual Conference assembled, marked the
high esteem and appreciation in which Sir William is held by the Church with
which his name is associated, by electing him to the honourable position of
President of the Conference, a distinction only conferred upon one other layman
during the past hundred years.<br>
<br>
 "In grateful recognition of his services and in addition to and following on
the honours already mentioned, this Council doth, in pursuance of the Honorary
Freedom of the Borough Act, 1885, confer upon Sir William P. Hartley of Aintree
and Southport the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Colne, and doth hereby
admit him to be an Honorary Freeman of the said Borough accordingly, the
highest distinction which it is in the power of the Council to confer.<br>
<br>
 "John Smith, <i>Mayor</i>.<br>
<br>
 "Alfred Varley, <i>Town Clerk</i>."</blockquote>

<p>The presentation was made at the Mayor's banquet on November 9, 1909. In his
reply Sir William touched on his early business struggles in Colne in a passage
already quoted[*]. He continued: "I have other memories awakened during this
dinner. I have been reminded that this very site of ground--where the Town Hall
now stands--is the one on which the cottage house stood in which my wife lived
in her young days before we were married. I thank the Council with all my heart
for the honour you have conferred upon me in making me a Freeman of my native
town, and I also much appreciate the kind words spoken by Alderman Foulds and
the other gentlemen. The honour of being a Freeman of Colne touches me very
much; more so than the Freedom of any other borough. The ups and downs of life
and the development of a business career often take men from the home of their
childhood. That has been so in my case. But there are few men who do not retain
happy memories of the playground of their youth and the place where their
ambitions were born."</p>

<p>[*] Transcriber's note: see quote in Preface beginning with "My pleasant
visit to Colne".</p>

<p>In politics Mr. Hartley was a Liberal. Owing to the excessive claims on his
time and the unsatisfactory condition of his health he never stood for
Parliament, though he was frequently pressed to do so.[*] But he contributed
liberally to the party funds, especially when some great principle was at stake
in which he was interested. On such issues as the education controversy, or the
veto of the House of Lords, or Temperance Reform or Old Age Pensions, he was
heartily in sympathy with the policy of his party. He was a Passive Resister to
the Education Act passed by the Unionist Government, whose majority had been
largely secured by votes given for another purpose at the Khaki election. He
watched with great interest the Parliamentary career of his son-in-law, Mr. J.
S. Higham, who was for a number of years the Liberal member for Sowerby Bridge,
and lost his seat in a triangular contest, a misfortune which deprived the
House of Commons of a member who had held a prominent place in the Radical wing
of the party and had done very useful work on committees of the House.</p>

<p>[*] On October 2, 1903, he wrote to Mr. H. R. Mansfield, M.P., a fellow
Primitive Methodist, as follows: "Allow me to say that I have watched with
great interest and satisfaction your Parliamentary activity, both inside and
outside the House. If my health were better, I should certainly accept the
pressing invitations to stand for a constituency."</p>

<p>The European War somewhat modified his attitude. He favoured a coalition
Government before it became a matter of practical politics, and when the
rupture came between Mr. Asquith and Mr. Lloyd George he enthusiastically
supported the latter. He had been inclined in the closing years of his life to
dissent from the party policy on Free Trade, believing that some modification
of its rigidity in the direction of Colonial Preference was desirable.</p>

<p>He had no belief that Socialism was a practical remedy for the evils which
all men of good-will deplore. At the profit-sharing in January, 1912, with Sir
Edward Russell in the chair, he expressed his views on the subject. He referred
to the fact that during the preceding year there had been a succession of
strikes all over the country and general labour unrest. To cure the trouble it
was necessary, he said, that a reasonable attitude should be adopted on both
sides and that each should look at all questions from the point of view of the
other. Labour was often highly organized, and organized labour, if it was not
carefully guided, could be as despotic as the most selfish capitalist. They had
much to be thankful for that the good understanding which had always existed
between them at Aintree had saved them from labour troubles. Much was said, he
continued, in some quarters in praise of Socialism; but if any of them were
tempted to think that Socialism was a cure for Labour troubles, he would
suggest that Socialism, as generally understood, namely that the means of
production, distribution and exchange should be taken out of the hands of the
persons who were at present responsible for it and placed in the hands of the
State, would not work. The theory was excellent, but you must reckon with human
nature as it was. In his opinion what was needed was an equal opportunity for
every one.</p>

</center>

<p>When the Primitive Methodist Conference was held at Nottingham in 1893, Mr.
Hartley presided at a meeting for working men. He made a speech, the major part
of which deserves to be quoted. He said: "A working man's meeting at a
Primitive Methodist Conference is in every way a fitting arrangement. For more
than fifty years Primitive Methodism has been intent upon the working man's
material, social, and religious welfare. Our Connexion was busy in the early
half of this century preparing the miners of the North and the agricultural
labourers of the South for the duties and responsibilities of citizenship. As
some part of the fruit of our labours I would point to the number of men
nurtured in Primitive Methodism who are to-day the trusted leaders of the
working men. We have reason to be proud of such men as Thomas Burt, Charles
Fenwick, John Wilson, and many others that might be named. In the peaceful
revolution which has enthroned the democracy Primitive Methodism has played a
leading part. We have not the reputation of being wealthy--but 'A man's life
consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.' Thank God,
happiness is from within, not from without. It is what a man is, and not what a
man has. At the same time, a man may be as rich as the Rothschilds, and yet be
a decided Christian. You need not envy such a man, because to be a follower of
Jesus Christ he must hold his wealth as a stewardship, and to do this involves
such a crucifixion of our natural selfishness as to make it one of the most
difficult things in the world...Religion is not only a thing of the Church, the
prayer meeting, or holiness conventions; it is all these but a very great deal
more. It is a thing of the factory, the workshop, the mine, the office; in a
word, it is a life to be lived, and I want Primitive Methodist working men to
be models of their class. Don't give as little service as you can to your
employers, and expect impossible wages; and when trade is good don't follow the
example of those who stay away from their work on a Monday and only turn up on
Tuesday, and when bad trade comes go round singing, 'We've got no work to do.'
Remember the command, 'Be diligent in business, fervent in spirit, serving the
Lord.' I would say, my friends, let employers also remember that as followers
of Jesus Christ they are bound to treat their workpeople as fellow-workers, and
carry on their business on Christian principles."</p>

<h2><a name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3><i>Closing Years</i></h3>

<p>With the outbreak of the War on August 4, 1914, life for all of us passed
into a new phase. Sir William was at the time sixty-eight, and after his
laborious years and heavy trials he might well look forward to less strenuous
times. But the war brought very severe demands not only on his resources but on
his time and energy. He was one of a small company, summoned in the early days
of the conflict by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Lloyd George, to advise
him on financial policy. He contributed very largely to benevolent funds. To
the War Relief Fund he gave &pound;10,000, he also doubled the weekly gifts of
his workpeople and the members of the staff. He supported Red Cross Work with
great liberality. He contributed &pound;5,000 to the French Fund and led off
with a donation of &pound;5,000 to the Belgian Fund. As was usual, he looked
after the interest of those among his employees who joined the colours and
cared for their dependents. The heavier rate of taxation was felt by him as by
multitudes more.</p>

<p>But he found the strain of the situation in other ways. His staff was
greatly depleted, to such a degree indeed that the position became nearly
impossible. At one time he told me that if another man was taken from his staff
he could not go on, but would have to close down. He was much hampered by the
incompetent interference of Government officials. Directions were sent down as
to how the jam was to be made. "We know," he said to me, "that it can't be made
in that way." Large Government orders had to be fulfilled, but it was difficult
to procure the necessary material. Much precious time was consumed by the
filling in of forms giving quite unnecessary information. "We have nothing to
conceal," he said; but whole weeks went in gratifying the official thirst for
irrelevant statistics, and this at a time when it taxed his strength to keep
pace with the legitimate demands of his business. He did not complain about the
financial burden. He was whole-heartedly devoted to the cause of his country
and cheerfully met the obligations it imposed. But he felt that a difficult
task was rendered more difficult than it need have been by the unreasonable
attitude of Government officials.</p>

<p>Nor did he escape the sorrow which came to so many homes. His dearly loved
grandson, Hartley Barkby, the son of his eldest daughter and the Rev. J. T.
Barkby, a boy of exceptional promise and of great personal charm, was killed in
action. He had joined the forces as an artillery officer just when he was about
to begin his course at Cambridge. His devotion to the national cause may be
judged from the fact that he celebrated his eighteenth birthday in the
trenches. In commemoration of him Sir William founded a scholarship in
perpetuity at Mill Hill School where he had received his education.</p>

<p>In February, 1916, he attained his seventieth birthday. In grateful
recognition of the Providence which had spared him to so ripe an age he devoted
the whole of the &pound;30,000 he had invested in War Loan to hospitals in
London and Liverpool, to Trade Charities, and the Pension Fund for his
workpeople.</p>

<p>In May of the same year he and Lady Hartley celebrated their Golden Wedding.
They were the recipients of warm congratulations from children, grandchildren
and numerous friends, from their work people and staffs at Aintree and in
London, from institutions and churches with which they were associated. It had
been their hope before the war broke out that this happy Jubilee might be
celebrated by the opening of the Maternity Hospital at Liverpool. But this
project, like that of the Colne Hospital, had been frustrated by the national
situation. I can speak from personal recollection of two celebrations; one was
at Church Street, Southport, the Church he attended. A presentation was made to
him and to Lady Hartley, and several speakers expressed the goodwill of the
gathering. The other was at the Primitive Methodist Conference in Nottingham,
to which reference has already been made.</p>

<p>There is naturally little to record in the period which followed down to the
Armistice on November 11, 1918. They were years of great anxiety and strain and
told upon his health. The Armistice, of course, gave an immeasurable relief to
the country; but the years which followed brought with them new and formidable
difficulties of their own. The process of decontrol of prices affected him very
seriously. It was necessary for him to lay in very large stocks of sugar which
had to be bought at a high price. It was no doubt a great benefit to the
ordinary consumer for the price to be reduced, but the consequence was that jam
which had been most costly to produce, owing to the very high price at which
the sugar had been bought, had to be sold at a price corresponding to the far
lower price to which sugar was reduced--or it had to remain unsold.</p>

<p>He was distressed for others who suffered commercial shipwreck, but was
grateful that he was able to weather the storm. His position would have been
easier if he had taken advantage of the rise in prices during the war. But
speaking at his profit-sharing in January, 1915, he explained the position as
he saw it.</p>

<blockquote>"We could have made a much larger profit in the past year had we
taken advantage of the rise in sugar when war was declared on August 4; but as
our soft fruits--raspberry, strawberry, and black currant--had at that time
nearly all been made, we decided that we would not advance the prices of the
soft-fruit jams, although as a matter of business we were entitled to do so. We
were resolved--I was very firm on it myself--not to make profit out of national
necessities."</blockquote>

<p>He experienced much difficulty also through the tightness of money and the
inability or unwillingness of the banks to advance money even for legitimate
business enterprises, at least to the extent which the colossal character of
his business required.</p>

<p>His charity fund was also seriously hampered by the conditions. As I have
already explained he had promised to build a hospital at Colne and he lost no
time after the Armistice in taking up the project at the point where he had
been compelled to lay it down. But the enormous rise in the cost of materials
and labour now involved an expenditure of &pound;100,000 instead of a quarter
of that amount.</p>

<p>1919 was notable for other developments. In this year his business was
turned into a limited liability company. He was fortunate in that his
son-in-law, Mr. J. S. Higham, was able to come for part of his time to Aintree,
owing to the fact, lamentable in itself, that in a three-cornered contest at
Sowerby Bridge he had lost his seat in Parliament. This brought Sir William
considerable relief. In this year he was invited to accept the Mayoralty of
Colne, an invitation which he highly valued; but, as I have related elsewhere,
he was reluctantly compelled to decline. The year was also memorable in his
home life, since he sold Sea View, Southport, and purchased Horsfield Cottage,
Oxford Road, Birkdale, as his residence. His only son was married and at the
head of the works in London, and six of his daughters had also married. The
family was thus reduced to three, and the domestic strain was greatly lightened
by removal to a smaller house. For some years Miss Hartley had rendered great
service on the Ormskirk Board of Guardians and she subsequently became a member
of the Southport Town Council. But her public duties did not diminish the
vigilant and affectionate care which she lavished on her father and mother.
When in 1921 the invitation to become Mayor of Southport was tendered to her it
was at first refused because of her obligations at home. When it was finally
accepted, although it inevitably involved a heavy tax on her time and strength,
she watched over their health and comfort with true filial devotion. Her father
was proud of the honour which had come to her and proud of the distinction she
attained in her office. When she accepted it he said to her, "Do it well"; and
in a letter written towards the end of her term he testified that she had
carried out his counsel. He anticipated that soon he would be looking back on a
brilliant year of office successfully completed.</p>

<center>
<p><a name="il-13"></a><img alt="" src="0701091h-images/0701091h-13.jpg"></p>
</center>

<p>But it was ordered otherwise. For some years he had been liable to attacks
of angina pectoris; and for some time before his death the trouble seemed to be
provoked by very slight exertion. I happened to be in frequent correspondence
with him during this period, and in letter after letter he referred to it. His
language was so ominous that I feared that the end might come at any time. On
the other hand he had often shown such resilience in the past, such a fund of
recuperative energy, that I hoped that this period too would end in a return to
more stable health. To the members of his own family he seems to have been more
reticent, with characteristic unselfishness shrinking from alarming them. But
Miss Hartley watched over him with the utmost care and had been in his room
three times during the night which ended in his death. He felt, however,
sufficiently well to contemplate going to Aintree in the morning, but on
October 25,1922, the end came suddenly with the dawn.</p>

<p>Though I had been so fully prepared for the news that when it came the shock
of surprise was only faint, it was long before I could fully realize that he
had gone. He had filled so large a place in our thought and touched our life at
so many points that his withdrawal meant the creation of a void which it was
not easy to measure.</p>

<p>The funeral service was held on October 28 at Church Street, Southport,
where for so many years he had worshipped and for which he had done so much.
From far and near a great assembly gathered to do his memory honour. The Church
was crowded to its utmost limits. The Town Council, the County and Borough
magistrates and the Board of Guardians attended. A large number of institutions
sent representatives. The minister of the Church, the Rev. H. J. Pickett,
conducted the service. The Rev. F. W. Dwelly, the Vicar of Emanuel Church, read
the Psalm. The lesson was read by the Rev. T. J. Gladwin, the secretary of the
Chapel Aid Association. The President of the Conference, the Rev. H. J. Taylor,
offered the prayer. At the request of the family the difficult task of giving
the address was entrusted to me. After the service the funeral procession went
by road to Colne. The whole town where he had been born, and for which he had
done so much, was in mourning. The body was buried at Trawler, where his father
and mother had also been laid to rest. The service at the graveside was taken
by the Rev. J. H. Pickup, minister of the Colne Primitive Methodist Church, Dr.
S. P. Duval the Rector of Colne, and the Rev. H. J. Pickett. On the following
day the morning service at Church Street was devoted to Sir William's memory.
It was conducted by the Rev. H. J. Pickett, who paid a full and beautiful
tribute to his personality and his achievements. Many appreciations appeared in
the Press, many resolutions of sympathy were sent by religious, philanthropic
and municipal organizations, and from a host of friends and admirers there came
messages of sympathy, admiration and love.</p>

<p>As was fitting, the resolution of the Primitive Methodist Conference, held
at Liverpool in the following June, was moved at the Session devoted to the
business of the missionary department. For it was in connexion with it that he
first attained denominational fame, and he had been treasurer of the Missionary
Society for many years. His friend, Sir Thomas Robinson of Cleethorpes, the
Vice-President of Conference, was in the Chair. The resolution was prepared and
proposed by the Rev. A. Baldwin, the financial secretary. The Rev. H. J.
Pickett paid a tribute so just and adequate in its substance and so perfect in
its phrasing that I wished we could have carried the resolution while his voice
still lingered in our ears. But at the bidding of the Chairman I tried to
express the mind of the Conference as we thought what manner of man he was and
what by his gifts and still more by his statesmanship, he had done for our
Church.</p>

<p>In his honour a Hartley Memorial Fund was raised, chiefly from contributions
voted by trustees of Churches. The money was allotted to the training of
medical missionaries and the help of needy students. Part of it was expended on
a bust which has been placed in Hartley College. The service at its unveiling
was conducted by the Rev. H. J. Pickett, formerly Sir William's minister at
Southport, now serving for a second term as Principal of the College. It was
fitting that the bust should be unveiled by a member of the family, the Rev. J.
T. Barkby, in his official capacity as President of the Conference. He had been
Sir William's minister for twelve years, he had been his colleague in the
Missionary Society, acting as its secretary, while Sir William was its
treasurer, and the words he uttered had behind them the weight of long,
intimate, and varied knowledge. The Committee invited me to give the address.
It was a special pleasure to me that the Rev. George Armitage, who had just
retired from the office of General Secretary of the denomination, should
represent the Memorial Committee of which he had been the secretary. He had
done much for the College as its secretary for many years, and there had fallen
to his share more than one heavy burden during his term of office, especially
that in connexion with the second enlargement.</p>

<p>That the bust should find its home in Hartley College was altogether
appropriate, but we might apply in his case the words inscribed on Christopher
Wren's tablet in St. Paul's Cathedral: "Monumentum si quaeris, circumspice."
The College itself is his true monument.</p>

<h2><a name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3><i>Personal Qualities</i></h3>

<p>It remains to give a connected description of his personal characteristics
and some estimate of his achievement.</p>

<p>Nature had been liberal in her gifts. The distinction of his personal
appearance was very striking, people turned to look at him as he passed along
the street, and he commanded attention in whatever company he might be. In his
prime he was a handsome man, and age touched his face with a new beauty. He was
endowed with fine sensibilities, in particular with great delicacy of touch.
But it is constantly borne in upon us how large a part health plays in our
career. It is true that much of the world's best work has been done by delicate
people. But it is also true that for the great worker health is an invaluable
asset. We sometimes speak of tireless energy, and when we watch the vast and
steady output year after year we imagine that behind it there must lie a
physical constitution, tough, wiry, elastic, with an iron strength and nerves
of steel. But often it is not so. Of the cost to brain and nerve only the man
himself can tell; and much is achieved simply because the spirit resolutely
insists on maintaining the upper hand of the body. Presumably Nature equipped
Mr. Hartley with a constitution both tough and flexible. But to have laboured
at the full stretch of his power for long hours every day--for though Sunday
brought with it its change of occupation, it was nevertheless a full day--was
enough to damage seriously a constitution even more robust. Before he had
passed into middle age he had to pay heavily for his excessive toil, and the
state of his health was a constant anxiety to his friends. It was inevitable
that in later life some of the old vigour should have gone. Yet considering all
that he put into his life--his long hours, his innumerable anxieties, his
refusal, while he was making his position secure, to give himself any
holidays,[*] it is surprising that he retained so much of the old elasticity
and driving power of his youth.</p>

<p>[*] At a later period he did take holidays, but even then he would not on
any account leave his business between the beginning of July and the end of
September. In a letter he wrote on May 24, 1899, he says that he had never left
his business during that period for twenty-five years. A voyage might have
given him the rest and the change of air that he needed, but unfortunately he
was a bad sailor. Writing to a cousin in Australia on December 6, 1904, in
response to an invitation, he said: "I have been once to the Mediterranean and
once to America, twenty years ago, and I was the worst sailor on board each
way, and this makes me very nervous. If I were a good sailor I should be with
you with very little loss of time." And it was not merely from long voyages
that he shrank. In a letter of August 23, 1903, to a minister in the Isle of
Man, he said: "I know little of the Isle of Man, as I am a bad sailor, and have
not been there for more than ten years."</p>

<p>He was subject to great fluctuations of mood and these tended to vary with
his health. At times nothing could thwart his amazing energy or daunt his
radiant optimism. But when his nerves were badly worn or he was visited with
the severe oppression on the top of his head, to which his friends at one
period of his life so often heard him allude, this buoyancy gave way to
depression and weariness. Sometimes the sense of physical fatigue and lassitude
forced him to rest; at other times his resolute will might gain a costly
victory over it. Nevertheless he had great resilience and surprising
recuperative power. He laid down the most stringent rules for himself against
accepting any fuller responsibilities in his business. I have before me a most
interesting paper, dated May 28, 1890, for insertion as the first page of his
pocket books. He determined not to engage any new travellers or make any new
article or any speciality of his existing articles; to limit the extension of
his trade to the natural requirements of the 5,000 customers he already had;
before erecting a new warehouse to be convinced of its necessity for at least
three months, and then to do it only for his present customers; to do one thing
at a time, the most important first; to think of his health first and his
business second; and as soon as he went to Aintree to keep a pair of carriage
horses so as to get all the fresh air he possibly could.[*] The trouble of
which he complained was a fearful oppression on the head if he did much
detailed work, especially figures, and the failure of mind and memory which had
lost their former elasticity. He says that he had had these oppressive warnings
for about ten years. He closes with an interesting quotation:</p>

<blockquote>"Let not thy mirth be so extravagant as to intoxicate thy mind, nor
thy grief so heavy as to depress thy heart: this world affordeth no good so
transporting, nor inflicteth any evil so severe as should raise thee far above,
or sink thee much beneath the balance of moderation."</blockquote>

<p>[*] This was carried out. A note for October 23, 1890, runs: "Used own
carriage and pair for first time to-day."</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe that on October 20 in the same year he had a
consultation with the architect as to the erection of a new five-floor
warehouse and that within eight days a ware house with six floors was
contemplated. Even if, as is quite probable, this warehouse had been previously
decided on, he erected a second warehouse at Aintree in 1899-1900, while the
London ware house was opened in 1901; the Botanical laboratory was built and
equipped at Liverpool and opened in 1902; the first extension of the Primitive
Methodist College was complete in 1897 and the second much larger extension in
1906. In addition to these the Aintree Institute, the Cottage Hospital at
Colne, the Cottage Homes and the large new Hospital only recently opened, all
still lay in the future.</p>

<p>He was himself quite aware of his tendency to break his good resolutions.
Thus in a letter to the Rev. J. G. Bowran, June 27, 1907, explaining his lack
of leisure for reading, he said:</p>

<blockquote>"My life is very full because with my large business in Liverpool
and London, together with my public and charity work, I have double the amount
of work that any man ought to attempt. I make dozens of resolutions that I will
lessen it, but for some reason I am unable to do it. I am quite sure that the
strenuous life I lead will tend to shorten my life, and indeed it is a sin
against light and knowledge.<br>
<br>
 "I am constantly asked and pressed to go here, there, and do this and that,
and every day brings me an enormous correspondence--I cannot tell you how I was
deluged with begging letters of all kinds after the Leicester
Conference."</blockquote>

<p>Another letter which is interesting for the writer's self-analysis was sent
to Dr. Thomson on October 5, 1908, with reference to a conversation they had
had on an extension of the sanatorium at Delamere. In the course of it he
says:</p>

<blockquote>"I ought also to say that on my way home in the motor on Saturday
night I felt that it would have been better for me not to have mentioned the
matter of any extension to you because I am so much engaged every day with my
large business in Liverpool and London, together with my public and private
work, that I really have not time to give attention to all the big engineering
and other schemes that would be needful if a substantial enlargement were to
take place. One of the faults of my make-up is that I go into these things much
too closely, and while I am immensely interested in the whole affair and able
to talk to you on the matter when I am at Delamere, my difficulties at once
begin when I come to business and find so very much to do."</blockquote>

<p>In this connexion I might quote from a letter written to me by the Rev. J.
T. Barkby, who speaks on the subject with quite exceptional knowledge and
authority. He expressed himself in the same sense when he unveiled the bust of
Sir William at Hartley College.</p>

<blockquote>"Few things in Sir William surprised me more than the continual
freshness of his interest in the affairs of men and women, Society and the
Church. He had plenty to chill and deaden his interest. People disappointed
him; some deceived him; he lost money at the hands of people he had implicitly
trusted, and sometimes large sums of money; but his willingness to help was
always fresh and keen. I have known him come in at night after a very tiring
day at business and deal with disappointing things in connexion with the Church
and philanthropy, and his interest was always keen. I have not known a person
who kept fresher his interest through all the vicissitudes of life than Sir
William, not one equal to him."</blockquote>

<p>We must next inquire what were the qualities which made him so successful in
his career. The long and crowded story of English industry and commerce
contains the names of many who have amassed great fortunes, though they started
from a comparatively humble position. Sometimes it has been an exceptional
stroke of luck, as we call it, which has given them the start in the race or
proved the turning-point in their upward struggle. Sometimes they have achieved
because they have had the knack to reap where others had sown, to exploit for
their own advantage the brains of their less enterprising and pushful fellows.
Others again have owed their success to their unscrupulousness. They have cared
little for the dictates even of ordinary business morality, in their
determination to command success. But we render a fuller honour to those who
have attained their position by their own native qualities. Sometimes it has
been won by sheer plodding and tenacity of purpose, sometimes brilliant
financial genius has, with comparatively little labour, secured a bountiful
harvest.</p>

<p>When, late in life, Sir William was asked to give the first twelve rules of
success, his answer was: "For the first twelve rules of success I should repeat
'hard work' twelve times." This was salutary advice to offer and no one could
with a fuller right enforce the duty of unceasing labour. Indeed, but for this
he might himself have gone under in his early career; or at least his success
might have been long delayed. But obviously it is not a complete account of his
own success. Strenuous labour and unremitting attention to his calling might
have laid the foundation of a solid business and a responsible position in the
commercial world.</p>

<p>But he would never have risen at a comparatively early age to be one of our
merchant princes had he not been gifted with rarer qualities than these. If
genius were, as it has been incompletely defined, an infinite capacity for
taking pains, Mr. Hartley would have exemplified it perhaps in only too large a
degree. His friends were sometimes tempted to regret that he devoted such
minute attention to detail. They have felt that he often gave personal
attention to things which others could do and thus leave him free for work
which few could do as he did. But on reflection they have come to recognize
that this close study of minutiae was a very important element in the success
he achieved and that his complete command of the facts equipped him with no
little of his power. He himself attributed his success to the fact that he kept
his eye on details and was alert to note every improvement that might make for
the quality of his manufactures and the health and comfort of his work
people.</p>

<p>But we are entitled to speak of genius in the higher sense of the term. It
goes without saying that the qualities which enabled him to erect, from the
ground upwards, so solid and so imposing a structure, were very remarkable.
That beyond all this he was able to devote such precious time and unshrinking
labour to unselfish assistance of good causes, is itself a striking tribute to
his constructive and executive powers. Genius was not in his case simply the
capacity for taking pains, but that quick intuition into the heart of a thing
and broad grasp of it in all its bearings which so signally characterized his
career. The touch of impatience, which sometimes came into his conversation,
was due partly to his sense of the value of time and partly to the quickness
and keenness of his intellect. While others were unfolding their fumbling
explanations, he had grasped the situation and divined possibilities which
their slower minds may not have apprehended. He was gifted with great fertility
and resourcefulness, with the power of combination and an almost uncanny
foresight. His agility of mind, his shrewdness, his sagacity, were all
noteworthy. He had a quick eye for the defects of a scheme and was fertile in
suggestions for improvement. For all his speed and power of swift decision, he
had a cool and balanced judgment and would weigh with great care the arguments
for rival courses. To all these qualities he added great driving force. His
executive and administrative ability was astonishing, his energy when his
strength permitted, seemed to know no bounds. His capacity for work was quite
exceptional and the amount he accomplished was colossal. Untiring industry, the
courage to face drudgery without shrinking, largely accounted for his early
success, but they were characteristic of him to the end. He owed his position
neither to his industry alone nor yet to his genius alone, but to the union of
these, with which, however, we must not forget to associate a sterling
integrity and a resolution that whatever he offered to the world should be the
best that he could produce. All these qualities were rendered the more
efficient by his talent for handling large and complex problems and his
readiness to seize the favourable opportunity.</p>

<p>And yet this is not all. He would probably have failed to obtain the
position he reached, and indeed would have fallen far short of it, if to his
unswerving industry and commercial genius he had not added the qualities of
courage and self-reliance. This was remarkably exemplified in his resolve to
leave Colne for Bootle. It was only his resolute determination to trust his own
judgment in face of the adverse opinion of all his friends which emboldened him
to take the tide of his fortune at the flood. This belief in himself, this
determination to stake his fortune on the soundness of his judgment, must have
been no inconsiderable factor in the total result.</p>

<p>Yet his great gifts and his self-reliance did not make him the type of man
who settles everything and consults nobody. Of his wife, as his foremost and
most trusted counsellor, I have already spoken. He talked over his plans with
the other members of his family, who shared his interests and contributed what
illumination they had to offer to the subject under consideration. But
naturally he had other advisers. He would take and carefully consider the
advice of the experts on any subject in which he was at the time interested. He
might not accept their counsel, for he recognized that the responsibility for
final decision must rest with himself; but if he rejected it, it would be
because, after careful consideration, he felt that his duty lay in another
direction. And sometimes his caution intervened at the last moment. If the
decision was a vital one, after all the expert counsel had been carefully
weighed and he had brought his own mind to bear on the problem and seemed on
the point of settlement, he would not infrequently determine to sleep on
it.</p>

<p>He certainly did not need the warning already quoted against intoxication by
a too extravagant mirth. But he had a cheerful temperament, a quiet humour of
his own, and great enjoyment of a good story. One day as we were walking from
Church together something had suggested the topic of sittings in Church and pew
rents. I illustrated it by a story which amused him so much that he had to stop
and laugh in the street. The story told how Magee related in the House of Lords
an experience he had when he was a Vicar. One Sunday morning after service an
infuriated parishioner came into the vestry and said, "I wish to inform you,
Sir, of an outrage which has been inflicted on me this morning. When I came to
Church I found a stranger sitting in my pew !! I had too much regard for
religion, Sir, and the house of God to have him turned out--but I took the
liberty, Sir, of sitting on his hat!" He was greatly amused by a letter which
he received from a Welsh customer. It ran as follows.</p>

<blockquote>Dear Sir,--<br>
<br>
 Why in the name of goodness gracious don't you send the jam I ordered last
week? I have already lost Mr. Jones' custom through you. Why don't you send the
jam, man? Bother you, you are a nuisance whatever! Send the jam at once,
quick.<br>
<br>
 Yours truly,<br>
<br>
 John Davies.<br>
<br>
 P.S.--Dear Sir,--<br>
<br>
 Since writing the above letter I have found the jam under the
counter.</blockquote>

<p>At table he would often be discussing some question of importance, but if
the conversation happened to strike an amusing vein, and especially if this
took the form of a good story, he would share as heartily as anyone in the
entertainment it created. But I was often struck by the deftness with which he
contrived to switch the conversation back to the practical problem without in
the least giving the impression that he resented the diversion. The same point
was noticed by Rev. J. Ritson, who was from 1891-8 the Primitive Methodist
minister at Aintree, and in constant communication with Mr. Hartley. He says:
"With a brain teeming with new ideas--commercial, architectural and
philanthropic, the marvel was that he could bear the strain. He found it
difficult to relax. He liked a good story, and would often be jovial or
hilarious over dinner or tea; but even there business and philanthropic schemes
would be discussed with his family."</p>

<p>It is not surprising that he had rather little time for reading. He kept in
touch with the papers, both secular and religious, and found time to read some
new books, though he lamented that his opportunities were so slender. He was
specially attracted by books which travelled on lines congenial to himself,
such as books on the right use of money, on the removal of social evils, and on
the fight with disease. He was deeply impressed by a volume, which caused at
the time of its publication a considerable sensation, <i>What Would Jesus
Do?</i> He found Russell Wallace's <i>Man and the Universe</i> a book of
entrancing interest, and wrote of it to me with enthusiasm. In his diary for
1890 there is a note on June 5: "I read this week 'God in Business' with great
pleasure and lasting profit." He spoke to me once of the pleasure and stimulus
he had found in reading one of Andrew Carnegie's books; I think it was his
<i>Problems of To-day</i>. In the letter already quoted, which he wrote on June
27, 1907, to the Rev. J. G. Bowran, better known to many as Ramsay Guthrie, he
said:</p>

<blockquote>"It is very good of you to send me a copy of your book, which I
accept with pleasure, and will do my best to read it, and I will ask my
daughters to do the same. I have very little time for reading, indeed much too
little.<br>
<br>
 "I did read some of the stories in the <i>Leader</i>, and every one that I
read gave me much pleasure. I think they were very well done, and I could
follow the dialect fairly well."</blockquote>

<p>His opportunities did not lead him in the direction of scholarship; but in
his attitude towards learning he was honourably distinguished from not a few
manufacturers. The wife of a very eminent scholar once said to me, speaking of
the manufacturers with whom she came in contact, "They have no appreciation of
any talent which does not find expression in money-making." I was constantly
struck by Sir William's complete detachment from such a standpoint. It would
have been excusable if in a life in which money-making played so large a part
the horizon had gradually contracted and he had lost the appreciation for the
less material side of existence.</p>

<p>But fortunately he escaped this peril. If it was not his vocation to tread
the high and difficult path of scholarship and abstract thought, no one was
warmer or more cordial in his recognition of the great part these qualities
must play in our complex life. How magnificently this was expressed in his zeal
for ministerial training has been told at length. But he was deeply interested
in education as such. He was a munificent benefactor of the University College,
which later became the University of Liverpool. Reading in the newspaper that a
clock was required, for which donations were invited, he presented a clock and
chimes on his own initiative. He set it in motion on Tuesday, November 15,
1892.</p>

<p>But his greatest gift was that of the Botanical Laboratory, splendidly
equipped. This cost &pound;14,000. The opening took place on May 10, 1902. Sir
William Thiselton-Dyer gave the address. In the resolution of thanks gratitude
was expressed to the donor not merely for his generosity in providing the
Laboratory but also "for the personal interest he has shown in the details of
its arrangement and equipment." It happened that the formation of a new
shipping combine, which it was thought might threaten disaster to Liverpool,
had been announced in the morning papers. I well remember how Mr. Hartley began
his reply by expressing his faith in the commercial future of Liverpool,
"shipping combines notwithstanding." He went on to say that they wanted
Liverpool to be a city of light and leading in still higher respects than
commerce. They wanted it to be distinguished by all that pertained to
knowledge, to the discovery of truth, to the encouragement of science in its
pure, as well as its applied branches, knowledge which not only made their
wealth more and their comfort greater, but which cultured the mind and
developed the higher faculties and functions of the soul. His object in giving
the laboratory to the city of his adoption was to help in that direction.</p>

<p>A wireless installation has now become so commonplace that it is difficult
to realize that this development is so recent. But in May, 1912, he presented a
complete wireless installation to the University, which was the only
educational institution in that part of the country to be so fortunately
equipped. He did not feel that Manchester had the same claims on him as
Liverpool, but he gave me &pound;1,000 for the new Arts Building at the
University.</p>

<p>He had the faculty of generous admiration for types of talent other than his
own. We are all familiar with the lament of Darwin that he had devoted himself
so strenuously to science that he had become a mere machine for grinding out
general laws from a great mass of facts. He said that if he had his time over
again he would take care to read some poetry and hear some music every week,
since if he had practised this rule his enjoyment of these aesthetic pleasures
would not have become atrophied for want of exercise. Sir William never
suffered himself to be sterilized into a mere machine for grinding out money. A
distinguished journalist once said to me that his interest seemed to be limited
to business, religion and philanthropy. But this was because he had not the
opportunity of observing the more artistic side of his nature. His
concentration on the business in hand was in fact so great that those who met
him in connexion with particular causes and interests might easily fail to
discover that there were quite other sides to his character and aptitudes. He
was, as a matter of fact, very fond of music[*] and he had great love of art.
He bought pictures more freely than anything else, not to decorate his walls,
but out of sheer joy in their beauty.</p>

<p>[*] The Rev. J. Ritson writes to me: "Music always had a great influence
over him. He often said that many of his best purposes owed their inspiration
to music and song."</p>

<p>Had he adopted architecture as his profession he must have risen to great
eminence in it. He loved to study plans. His criticism was sound, well-informed
and acute, his suggestions fresh and ingenious. He could calculate costs and
quantities almost instantaneously, with a rapidity, indeed, which reminded one
of the feats of the calculating boys. He knew the details of any buildings he
was erecting with great thoroughness. It was by no means an unknown thing for
him to put the architect right on his own designs. The artistic side of
architecture appealed to him; he liked a beautiful design. But this was
controlled by his practical instinct. He never lost sight of the purpose to
which the building was to be put, and adequate strength and solidity, ample
light and ventilation, easy gradients, facility for handling the stock, storage
capacity, were all matters for careful consideration. He was just as vigilant
in his attention to the special requirements of Hospitals or College as to the
construction of his own Works, and his advice to ministers and trustees with
reference to their churches and schools was of great value. The principle he
followed in his own building enterprises was: "Don't let us have too much in
the window, and let us have more on the counter." And he would apply this maxim
in the advice he gave as to churches and schools. He deprecated undue
ornamentation as involving an expenditure which might necessitate undesirable
economy in the provision of what was more essential. He would also urge the
importance of very careful consideration of details at the outset. A short time
spent on these details at the very beginning might save much time later on and
prevent the discovery of mistakes when it had become too late to rectify them.
He was, it need hardly be said, no friend to ugliness; but he was a devotee of
efficiency and the prudent use of money. He loved the beauty of simplicity.</p>

<p>In illustration of what I have said I might quote from a letter he wrote to
the Rev. J. G. Bowran on February 11, 1908:</p>

<blockquote>"I am just afraid you are about to make the new Church rather too
small. If you could increase the seating capacity by 100 or even 50, it would
be a good thing. I have considerable experience in building and I would
suggest, that whatever architect you employ, you yourself, and any other of the
friends who have any idea at all of building, should criticize the plans again,
again and again. Make up your mind how much or how little adornment you want,
both outside and inside; in other words, be perfectly satisfied in every way
before the quantities are taken out and the contract is let. A few hours now
might save much money and much disappointment."</blockquote>

<p>I pass on to those qualities which found their fullest expression in more
intimate, personal relationships. When I gave the address at his funeral I
selected the term "loyalty" to express his outstanding characteristic. His
loyalty to his native town will have been evident to all who have followed his
story as related in this biography. Local patriotism was one of the salient
features of his character. Just because he was born in Colne and had lived
there in the impressionable days of childhood and youth, learning the lessons
which were to stand him in such good stead in later life, he felt that he was
bound to it by ties of gratitude which he must honour. He cherished a deep
regard for the friends of his early days, especially those of his birthplace. I
well remember how one Sunday morning some of his old friends were at the
service and we walked along with them part of our way. When they had left us he
turned to me and said with emotion, "It's like meat and drink to me to see
those people." But it was not to the friends of his boyhood and youth alone
that he was loyal. As life went on he made many new friends. A quotation which
was not infrequently on his lips was this: "A man that hath friends must show
himself friendly." And right through his life he proved himself staunch and
loyal in his friendship. He was loyal to those who were associated with him in
business and to the places where his goods were sold. He seemed happiest of all
with his family about him, and he was whole heartedly devoted to all the
members of it. His loyalty to his Church and to the larger Church which
transcended denominational limits has been abundantly evident in our story. And
dominating all was the supreme loyalty.</p>

<p>In his attitude towards women and the woman's question he was in advance of
his time. He had constant experience of the value of his wife's judgment and
was thus not naturally disposed to acquiesce in conventional views as to the
incapacity of women for affairs. Women preachers were by no means unknown in
his own Church, and in its earlier days the denomination had women ministers.
He had seven daughters, a situation which I used to say to them reminded me of
Isaiah iv. 1. When they were old enough to be consulted, their opinion was
often asked and welcomed in the family circle, especially on causes to be
helped from his philanthropic fund. Miss Hartley, in the address she gave after
she had been made Mayor of Southport, paid grateful tribute to the fact that
she had been brought up in a home where the opinion of women was invited and
valued. Her father appreciated and understood to an unusual degree the woman's
point of view. He recognized that women had their part to play not only in the
home, but in public life and in the Church. He was in warm sympathy with the
work done by Miss Hartley on the Board of Guardians and on the Southport Town
Council. When he offered the Hartley Homes to Colne he desired that a third of
the managing committee should be women, and said that he should greatly approve
the appointment of women on the Town Council.</p>

<p>He was very hospitable, and so far as the extraordinary pressure of his work
and engagements permitted, would give up time to his guests. He was solicitous
for their comfort and anxious to consult their convenience. And he had both
sides of the virtue mentioned in the well-known couplet; he would not only
welcome the coming, he would also speed the parting guest. Many times during my
residence at Freshfield he would remind me on a Sunday evening that I must go
if I was to catch the last train home. Similarly on a Sunday morning it was our
custom to walk away from Church together, and he was careful to see that I did
not go so far with him as to risk missing my train, and he would not
infrequently, especially if we had much to talk about, walk back part or the
whole of the way to the station with me.</p>

<p>For a man of his great wealth his mode of life was very simple. He lived in
a good house with reasonable comfort. But he did not keep up an establishment
such as many with far less ample resources would have felt themselves justified
in doing. He was, in fact, rather shocked at the style in which some very good
and philanthropic people lived, although they did not exceed or even reach the
standard of living which would be usual with people of their means. And he
disapproved of the way in which people who had risen from comparative poverty
launched out in personal and family expenditure before they had amply secured
their financial position. He coveted the best things for his family, and so far
as money was needed to provide them he cheerfully gave it even when it meant
sacrifice. Unlike so many who rise to great wealth from a humble station in
life he was simple and frugal in his personal tastes and habits. He was in no
sense penurious, but vulgar show, senseless extravagance, and selfish luxury
were utterly repellent to him. He shunned ostentation, he remained hearty and
cordial to his old friends, though their social and financial position remained
what it was when he had known them in his native town. He was a great believer
in the virtue of thrift. He welcomed it in his workpeople; he called attention
to it when instituting his pension fund; he inculcated it when distributing the
profits. Thus at the profit-sharing in January, 1910, after counselling them
against liquor and gambling, he went on to urge them, if they felt it necessary
to spend their profit-sharing, to do so with great care, and if they could save
it, or a part of it, for a rainy day, so much the better. All the great
benefactors of whom they had any record had been thrifty people. He and his
wife had practised thrift during the whole of their married life, and he
strongly advised them to pursue the same policy.</p>

<p>He had by nature a fundamental integrity of character which furnished the
sound basis for the finer graces and qualities of his personality. A friend of
mine was once in a grocer's shop and heard a customer expressing himself
scornfully about the Nonconformist conscience. "What is this 'Nonconformist
conscience,' I should like to know?" he said. The grocer promptly reached down
a pot of Hartley's jam and, placing it with some emphasis on the counter, said,
"That's the Nonconformist conscience!" This sterling integrity not only made
him exact and even punctilious in maintaining the quality of his goods, but in
the conduct of his business it often took him far beyond his legal or even his
conventional obligations. His promptness and punctuality, his sense of order,
his accuracy and exactness, his minute attention to detail, his watchfulness in
things little as well as things great, his sense of honour, his cultivation of
the commonplace as well as of the finer business virtues, were all expressions
of a personality which was sound from the surface to the core. And yet with all
this he might have been an unattractive personality. There are men who have
built up their own fortunes by eminent business abilities and with strict
integrity of character who yet inspire us with a feeling of cold dislike. They
may be conceited in their self-appreciation, and irritating in their
self-complacency, overbearing and arrogant in their manner, selfish and sordid
in their outlook, dead to everything but material concerns. But in the case of
Sir William inflexibility of principle was redeemed from all that was narrow or
sour by his more humane and generous qualities. There was a gracious courtesy
in his bearing, which did not slide into undue familiarity because it was
always informed by self-respect. And while he could not be blind to the
qualities which had given him his great position, he preserved throughout
unaffected modesty of demeanour and genuine humility of spirit. His
far-reaching philanthropy expressed in his maxim, "Humanity first!" was rooted
in warm affections and a tender heart. The misery and suffering of his fellows
moved him to a profound pity.</p>

<p>These moral and intellectual qualities were transfigured by religion. He
exhibited that balanced combination of the ethical and the religious which
creates the finest type of personality. Conscience was the monitor to be
implicitly obeyed, duty the guide to whose voice he was never deaf. But
religion had transformed conscience and duty into something more winning and
inspiring, though not less lofty. Through a long life religion was his supreme
interest, but religion interpreted in no contracted way. It was for him an
experience which demanded adequate expression in conduct. He was far from
insensible to its emotional value; but he had no use for a religion which found
no outlet in the service of humanity or in a holiness which culpably failed to
pay twenty shillings in the pound. Without religion he might have done much
useful humanitarian work, or found a field for his energies in the duties of
citizenship. But it was religion which was the mainspring of his humanitarian
achievement. And that not simply in the largely ecclesiastical channels into
which it was directed. The definite consecration by himself and his wife of
one-tenth of their income to religious and charitable purposes was a
distinctively spiritual act. And it was in the strength and under the
inspiration of religion that, as wealth grew, the proportion was steadily
increased. It was religion which, in spite of disillusion and weariness, of
disappointment and ingratitude, kept him to the steady fulfilment of his
self-imposed obligations through so many years.</p>

<p>But while he had no patience with the pietism which expresses itself in an
emotional religion, but sits loosely to the obligations of honour, is content
with an indifferent morality or disregards the sanctities of life, those would
utterly misjudge him who thought of him as untouched by the warmer and more
emotional side of religion. Religion was indeed for him no relaxing bath of
luxurious emotion. Yet, as we should expect in one of such deep feeling, he was
no stranger to that emotion in which the central experience of religion
consists.</p>

<p>He was not talkative about his religious experiences, but no one who knew
him intimately could doubt that his reticence veiled an intense spiritual life.
He was content to be a silent worshipper, following the whole service with
reverent absorption and listening to the preacher with the keenest interest as
he developed his theme. But a touching story, communicated to me by the Rev.
George Trusler, exhibits his devoutness in a less familiar light. It should be
said that Mr. Hartley was in the habit of visiting the Primitive Methodist
places of worship in towns or villages where he was staying or through which he
was passing, in order that he might acquaint himself with the condition of the
structure and its adequacy for the neighbourhood in which it was situated. When
Mr. Trusler was a minister at Ryde, in the Isle of Wight, more than thirty
years ago, Mr. Hartley visited the island, and in addition to seeing the
minister went to the Primitive Methodist chapel. The chapel-keeper was an
elderly woman and was at her work when he entered the building. She told how a
gentleman had come in and asked many questions about the work carried on and
the minister, and continued, "He took hold of my hand before leaving and said
'Let us pray,' and he stood and prayed for you and for us all." She added:
"I've shown lots of you ministers the chapel, but none of you ever prayed with
me as he did." It was a great joy to her when she learned who the visitor
was.</p>

<p>Another illustration may be given at this point. It was not unusual on a
Sunday evening for a hymn to be sung before we separated; often it was, "Oh,
for a heart to praise my God!" One night we sang Miss Havergal's hymn, "Master,
speak, Thy servant heareth." When we had sung the second verse, he asked that
we might sing it again, quoting the two opening lines,</p>

<blockquote>"Speak to me by name, O Master,<br>
Let me know it is to me,"</blockquote>

<p>and adding "That is very sweet." The remark seemed to me very suggestive. It
lit up by a sudden flash how much in his own religious life and the action
which grew out of it, he was dependent on the sense of personal guidance from
above.</p>

<p>With all this he was very critical of certain doctrines of sanctification.
He distrusted the representation of its attainment as an instantaneous act; he
felt that holiness was the outcome of long discipline and struggle. He
expressed himself strongly on this point in his address as Vice-President of
Conference. Naturally this cut rather sharply across Methodist sentiment, and
provoked some criticism, based on the conviction that entire sanctification was
not the outcome of human effort, but was the gift of omnipotent grace, and
might thus be attained in a moment. He was on his part critical of holiness
conventions. He felt considerable annoyance at the statement that he had been
so "mightily impressed" by some meetings at Oxford that he had promised
&pound;5,000 to a Free Church Fund. Of these meetings he said himself, "I was
deeply impressed with Mr. Meyer's address and Dr. Morgan's sermon. Both these
gave me great searchings of heart, and I have thought a great deal about them."
But his promise had been made on the previous day. In a letter to Mr. Beckworth
of September 22, 1903, he said: "You see therefore that I went to Oxford with
my mind made up what to do. I always go to our own Conference wound up previous
to going and I did the same here...I am coming more and more to the conclusion
that many of our people, and other people as well, can do very little until
they have been wound up by a holiness Convention."</p>

<p>It was not unnatural in view of his strong practical interests that he
should relegate theology to a comparatively unimportant place. Whether his
doctrinal views were accurate or not seemed to him relatively unimportant when
compared with the question whether in his daily life he exhibited the fruits of
the Spirit. And he felt that the teaching in the pulpit and in the Sunday
School should be primarily directed to train Christian character and produce
Christian conduct. He would probably have agreed with Matthew Arnold that
conduct was three-fourths of life, except that he might have urged that this
proportion was too small. He put his position with some emphasis when he was
Vice-President of the Primitive Methodist Conference in 1892.</p>

<blockquote>"I am not one of those who are much troubled as to creed; but I am
<i>much</i> exercised as to whether I am such a disciple of Jesus Christ that
my work people, my business friends, my neighbours, and my family can
constantly see the spirit and temper of the Master in my actions.<br>
<br>
 "My own opinion is that for thirty-five years (this being the time of my
recollection) we have listened to too many doctrinal and theological sermons
and too few as to the absolute importance of living Christlike lives; and
unless we be actually miniature Christs day by day, breathing His spirit and
living His life, it matters not what we believe, for our religion is a sham.
Our actual creed is what we put into practice, and no more; and we want to be
careful to see that our practice is equal to our creed."</blockquote>

<p>When, seventeen years later, he was President of the Conference, he enforced
the same position at least in its positive form. He said:</p>

<blockquote>"My last word must be that we Primitive Methodists, followers of
Jesus Christ, must carry into our life His spirit and teaching, and that
whatever we think Jesus Christ would have done, had He been in our place,
whether we are employers or employed, whether we are in business or out of
business, that we are compelled to do. This is the secret of all true success;
the consecration of ourselves and our substance to Him who loved us and laid
down His life for us."</blockquote>

<p>This may fittingly serve as our "last word" also.</p>
