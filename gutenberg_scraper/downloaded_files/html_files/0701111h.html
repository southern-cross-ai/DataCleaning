<h2><a id="fore1"
name="fore1">FOREWORD</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT was not my original intention ever to divulge the
whereabouts of Esau Cairn, or the mystery surrounding him. My change of mind
was brought about by Cairn himself, who retained a perhaps natural and human
desire to give his strange story to the world which had disowned him and
whose members can now never reach him. What he wishes to tell is his affair.
One phase of my part of the transaction I refuse to divulge; I will not make
public the means by which I transported Esau Cairn from his native Earth to a
planet in a solar system undreamed of by even the wildest astronomical
theorists. Nor will I divulge by what means I later achieved communication
with him, and heard his story from his own lips, whispering ghostily across
the cosmos.</p>

<p>Let me say that it was not premeditated. I stumbled upon the Great Secret
quite by accident in the midst of a scientific experiment, and never thought
of putting it to any practical use, until that night when Esau Cairn groped
his way into my darkened observatory, a hunted man, with the blood of a human
being on his hands. It was chance led him there, the blind instinct of the
hunted thing to find a den wherein to turn at bay.</p>

<p>Let me state definitely and flatly, that, whatever the appearances against
him, Esau Cairn is not, and was never, a criminal. In that specific case he
was merely the pawn of a corrupt political machine which turned on him when
he realized his position and refused to comply further with its demands. In
general, the acts of his life which might suggest a violent and unruly nature
simply sprang from his peculiar mental make-up.</p>

<p>Science is at last beginning to perceive that there is sound truth in the
popular phrase, "born out of his time." Certain natures are
attuned to certain phases or epochs of history, and these natures, when cast
by chance into an age alien to their reactions and emotions, find difficulty
in adapting themselves to their surroundings. It is but another example of
nature's inscrutable laws, which sometimes are thrown out of stride by
some cosmic friction or rift, and result in havoc to the individual and the
mass.</p>

<p>Many men are born outside their century; Esau Cairn was born outside his
epoch. Neither a moron nor a low-class primitive, possessing a mind well
above the average, he was, nevertheless, distinctly out of place in the
modern age. I never knew a man of intelligence so little fitted for
adjustment in a machine-made civilization. (Let it be noted that I speak of
him in the past tense; Esau Cairn lives, as far as the cosmos is concerned;
as far as the Earth is concerned, he is dead, for he will never again set
foot upon it.)</p>

<p>He was of a restless mold, impatient of restraint and resentful of
authority. Not by any means a bully, he at the same time refused to
countenance what he considered to be the slightest infringement on his
rights. He was primitive in his passions, with a gusty temper and a courage
inferior to none on this planet. His life was a series of repressions. Even
in athletic contests he was forced to hold himself in, lest he injure his
opponents. Esau Cairn was, in short, a freak&mdash;a man whose physical body
and mental bent leaned back to the primordial.</p>

<p>Born in the Southwest, of old frontier stock, he came of a race whose
characteristics were inclined toward violence, and whose traditions were of
war and feud and battle against man and nature. The mountain country in which
he spent his boyhood carried out the tradition. Contest&mdash;physical
contest&mdash;was the breath of life to him. Without it he was unstable and
uncertain. Because of his peculiar physical make-up, full enjoyment in a
legitimate way, in the ring or on the football field was denied him. His
career as a football player was marked by crippling injuries received by men
playing against him, and he was branded as an unnecessarily brutal man, who
fought to maim his opponents rather than win games. This was unfair. The
injuries were simply resultant from the use of his great strength, always so
far superior to that of the men opposed to him. Cairn was not a great
sluggish lethargic giant as so many powerful men are; he was vibrant with
fierce life, ablaze with dynamic energy. Carried away by the lust of combat,
he forgot to control his powers, and the result was broken limbs or fractured
skulls for his opponents.</p>

<p>It was for this reason that he withdrew from college life, unsatisfied and
embittered, and entered the professional ring. Again his fate dogged him. In
his training-quarters, before he had had a single match, he almost fatally
injured a sparring partner. Instantly the papers pounced upon the incident,
and played it up beyond its natural proportions. As a result Cairn's
license was revoked.</p>

<p><br>Bewildered, unsatisfied, he wandered over the world, a restless Hercules,
seeking outlet for the immense vitality that surged tumultuously within him,
searching vainly for some form of life wild and strenuous enough to satisfy
his cravings, born in the dim red days of the world's youth.</p>

<p>Of the final burst of blind passion that banished him for ever from the
life wherein he roamed, a stranger, I need say little. It was a
nine-days' wonder, and the papers exploited it with screaming
headlines. It was an old story&mdash;a rotten city government, a crooked
political boss, a man chosen, unwittingly on his part, to be used as a tool
and serve as a puppet.</p>

<p>Cairn, restless, weary of the monotony of a life for which he was
unsuited, was an ideal tool&mdash;for a while. But Cairn was neither a
criminal nor a fool. He understood their game quicker than they expected, and
took a stand surprisingly firm to them, who did not know the real man.</p>

<p>Yet, even so, the result would not have been so violent if the man who had
used and ruined Cairn had any real intelligence. Used to grinding men under
his feet and seeing them cringe and beg for mercy, Boss Blaine could not
understand that he was dealing with a man to whom his power and wealth meant
nothing.</p>

<p>Yet so schooled was Cairn to iron self-control that it required
first a gross insult, then an actual blow on the part of Blaine, to rouse
him. Then for the first time in his life, his wild nature blazed into full
being. All his thwarted and repressed life surged up behind the clenched fist
that broke Blaine's skull like an eggshell and stretched him lifeless
on the floor, behind the desk from which he had for years ruled a whole
district.</p>

<p>Cairn was no fool. With the red haze of fury fading from his glare, he
realized that he could not hope to escape the vengeance of the machine that
controlled the city. It was not because of fear that he fled Blaine's
house. It was simply because of his primitive instinct to find a more
convenient place to turn at bay and fight out his death fight.</p>

<p>So it was that chance led him to my observatory.</p>

<p>He would have left, instantly, not wishing to embroil me in his trouble,
but I persuaded him to remain and tell me his story. I had long expected some
catastrophe of the sort. That he had repressed himself as long as he did,
shows something of his iron character. His nature was as wild and untamed as
that of a maned lion.</p>

<p>He had no plan&mdash;he simply intended to fortify himself somewhere and
fight it out with the police until he was riddled with lead.</p>

<p>I at first agreed with him, seeing no better alternative. I was not so
naive as to believe he had any chance in the courts with the evidence that
would be presented against him. Then a sudden thought occurred to me, so
fantastic and alien, and yet so logical, that I instantly propounded it to my
companion. I told him of the Great Secret, and gave him proof of its
possibilities.</p>

<p>In short, I urged him to take the chance of a flight through space, rather
than meet the certain death that awaited him.</p>

<p>And he agreed. There was no place in the universe which would support
human life. But I had looked beyond the knowledge of men, in universes beyond
universes. And I chose the only planet I knew on which a human being could
exist&mdash;the wild, primitive, and strange planet I named Almuric.</p>

<p>Cairn understood the risks and uncertainties as well as I. But he was
utterly fearless&mdash;and the thing was done. Esau Cairn left the planet of
his birth, for a world swimming afar in space, alien, aloof, strange.</p>

<h2><a id="almuric1"

<h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>

<p class="first">THE TRANSITION was so swift and brief, that it seemed less
than a tick of time lay between the moment I placed myself in Professor
Hildebrand's strange machine, and the instant when I found myself
standing upright in the clear sunlight that flooded a broad plain. I could
not doubt that I had indeed been transported to another world. The landscape
was not so grotesque and fantastic as I might have supposed, but it was
indisputably alien to anything existing on the Earth.</p>

<p>But before I gave much heed to my surroundings, I examined my own person
to learn if I had survived that awful flight without injury. Apparently I
had. My various parts functioned with their accustomed vigor. But I was
naked. Hildebrand had told me that inorganic substance could not survive the
transmutation. Only vibrant, living matter could pass unchanged through the
unthinkable gulfs which lie between the planets. I was grateful that I had
not fallen into a land of ice and snow. The plain seemed filled with a lazy
summerlike heat. The warmth of the sun was pleasant on my bare limbs.</p>

<p>On every side stretched away a vast level plain, thickly grown with short
green grass. In the distance this grass attained a greater height, and
through it I caught the glint of water. Here and there throughout the plain
this phenomenon was repeated, and I traced the meandering course of several
rivers, apparently of no great width. Black dots moved through the grass near
the rivers, but their nature I could not determine. However, it was quite
evident that my lot had not been cast on an uninhabited planet, though I
could not guess the nature of the inhabitants. My imagination peopled the
distances with nightmare shapes.</p>

<p>It is an awesome sensation to be suddenly hurled from one's native
world into a new strange alien sphere. To say that I was not appalled at the
prospect, that I did not shrink and shudder in spite of the peaceful quiet of
my environs, would be hypocrisy. I, who had never known fear, was transformed
into a mass of quivering, cowering nerves, starting at my own shadow. It was
that man's utter helplessness was borne in upon me, and my mighty frame
and massive thews seemed frail and brittle as the body of a child. How could
I pit them against an unknown world? In that instant I would gladly have
returned to Earth and the gallows that awaited me, rather than face the
nameless terrors with which imagination peopled my new-found world. But I was
soon to learn that those thews I now despised were capable of carrying me
through greater perils than I dreamed.</p>

<p><br>A slight sound behind me brought me around to stare amazedly at the first
inhabitant of Almuric I was to encounter. And the sight, awesome and menacing
as it was, yet drove the ice from my veins and brought back some of my
dwindling courage. The tangible and material can never be as grisly as the
unknown, however perilous.</p>

<p>At my first startled glance I thought it was a gorilla which stood before
me. Even with the thought I realized that it was a man, but such a man as
neither I nor any other Earthman had ever looked upon.</p>

<p>He was not much taller than I, but broader and heavier, with a great
spread of shoulders, and thick limbs knotted with muscles. He wore a
loincloth of some silklike material girdled with a broad belt which supported
a long knife in a leather sheath. High-strapped sandals were on his feet.
These details I took in at a glance, my attention being instantly fixed in
fascination on his face.</p>

<p>Such a countenance it is difficult to imagine or describe. The head was
set squarely between the massive shoulders, the neck so squat as to be
scarcely apparent. The jaw was square and powerful, and as the wide thin lips
lifted in a snarl, I glimpsed brutal tusklike teeth. A short bristly beard
masked the jaw, set off by fierce, up-curving mustaches. The nose was almost
rudimentary, with wide flaring nostrils. The eyes were small, bloodshot, and
an icy gray in color. From the thick black brows the forehead, low and
receding, sloped back into a tangle of coarse, bushy hair. The ears were
small and very close-set.</p>

<p>The mane and beard were very blue-black, and the creature's limbs
and body were almost covered with hair of the same hue. He was not, indeed,
as hairy as an ape, but he was hairier than any human being I had ever
seen.</p>

<p>I instantly realized that the being, hostile or not, was a formidable
figure. He fairly emanated strength&mdash;hard, raw, brutal power. There was
not an ounce of surplus flesh on him. His frame was massive, with heavy
bones. His hairy skin rippled with muscles that looked iron-hard. Yet it was
not altogether his body that spoke of dangerous power. His look, his
carriage, his whole manner reflected a terrible physical might backed by a
cruel and implacable mind. As I met the blaze of his bloodshot eyes, I felt a
wave of corresponding anger. The stranger's attitude was arrogant and
provocative beyond description. I felt my muscles tense and harden
instinctively.</p>

<p>But for an instant my resentment was submerged by the amazement with which
I heard him speak in perfect English!</p>

<p>"Thak! What manner of man are you?"</p>

<p>His voice was harsh, grating and insulting. There was nothing subdued or
restrained about him. Here were the naked primitive instincts and manners,
unmodified. Again I felt the old red fury rising in me, but I fought it
down.</p>

<p>"I am Esau Cairn," I answered shortly, and halted, at a loss
how to explain my presence on his planet.</p>

<p>His arrogant eyes roved contemptuously over my hairless limbs and smooth
face, and when he spoke, it was with unbearable scorn.</p>

<p>"By Thak, are you a man or a woman?"</p>

<p>My answer was a smash of my clenched fist that sent him rolling on the
sward.</p>

<p>The act was instinctive. Again my primitive wrath had betrayed me. But I
had no time for self-reproach. With a scream of bestial rage my enemy sprang
up and rushed at me, roaring and frothing. I met him breast to breast, as
reckless in my wrath as he, and in an instant was fighting for my life.</p>

<p>I, who had always had to restrain and hold down my strength lest I injure
my fellow men, for the first time in my life found myself in the clutches of
a man stronger than myself. This I realized in the first instant of impact,
and it was only by the most desperate efforts that I fought clear of his
crushing embrace.</p>

<p>The fight was short and deadly. The only thing that saved me was the fact
that my antagonist knew nothing of boxing. He could&mdash;and did&mdash;strike powerful blows with his clenched fists, but they were clumsy,
ill-timed and erratic. Thrice I mauled my way out of grapples that would have
ended with the snapping of my spine. He had no knack of avoiding blows; no
man on Earth could have survived the terrible battering I gave him. Yet he
incessantly surged in on me, his mighty hands spread to drag me down. His
nails were almost like talons, and I was quickly bleeding from a score of
places where they had torn the skin.</p>

<p>Why he did not draw his dagger I could not understand, unless it was
because he considered himself capable of crushing me with his bare
hands&mdash;which proved to be the case. At last, half blinded by my smashes,
blood gushing from his split ears and splintered teeth, he did reach for his
weapon, and the move won the fight for me.</p>

<p>Breaking out of a half-clinch, he straightened out of his defensive crouch
and drew his dagger. And as he did so, I hooked my left into his belly with
all the might of my heavy shoulders and powerfully driving legs behind it.
The breath went out of him in an explosive gasp, and my fist sank to the
wrist in his belly. He swayed, his mouth flying open, and I smashed my right
to his sagging jaw. The punch started at my hip, and carried every ounce of
my weight and strength. He went down like a slaughtered ox and lay without
twitching, blood spreading out over his beard. That last smash had torn his
lip open from the corner of his mouth to the rim of his chin, and must surely
have fractured his jawbone as well.</p>

<p><br>Panting from the fury of the bout, my muscles aching from his crushing
grasp, I worked my raw, skinned knuckles, and stared down at my victim,
wondering if I had sealed my doom. Surely, I could expect nothing now but
hostility from the people of Almuric. Well, I thought, as well be hanged for
a sheep as a goat. Stooping, I despoiled my adversary of his single garment,
belt and weapon, and transferred them to my own frame. This done, I felt some
slight renewal of confidence. At least I was partly clothed and armed.</p>

<p>I examined the dagger with much interest. A more murderous weapon I have
never seen. The blade was perhaps nineteen inches in length, double-edged,
and sharp as a razor. It was broad at the haft, tapering to a diamond point.
The guard and pommel were of silver, the hilt covered with a substance
somewhat like shagreen. The blade was indisputably steel, but of a quality I
had never before encountered. The whole was a triumph of the
weapon-maker's art, and seemed to indicate a high order of culture.</p>

<p>From my admiration of my newly acquired weapon, I turned again to my
victim, who was beginning to show signs of returning consciousness. Instinct
caused me to sweep the grasslands, and in the distance, to the south, I saw a
group of figures moving toward me. They were surely men, and armed men. I
caught the flash of the sunlight on steel. Perhaps they were of the tribe of
my adversary. If they found me standing over their senseless comrade, wearing
the spoils of conquest, their attitude toward me was not hard to
visualize.</p>

<p>I cast my eyes about for some avenue of escape or refuge, and saw that the
plain, some distance away, ran up into low green-clad foothills. Beyond these
in turn, I saw larger hills, marching up and up in serried ranges. Another
glance showed the distant figures to have vanished among the tall grass along
one of the river courses, which they must cross before they reached the spot
where I stood.</p>

<p>Waiting for no more, I turned and ran swiftly toward the hills. I did not
lessen my pace until I reached the foot of the first foothills, where I
ventured to look back, my breath coming in gasps, and my heart pounding
suffocatingly from my exertions. I could see my antagonist, a small shape in
the vastness of the plain. Further on, the group I was seeking to avoid had
come into the open and were hastening toward him.</p>

<p>I hurried up the low slope, drenched with sweat and trembling with
fatigue. At the crest I looked back once more, to see the figures clustered
about my vanquished opponent. Then I went down the opposite slope quickly,
and saw them no more.</p>

<p>An hour's journeying brought me into as rugged a country as I have
ever seen. On all sides rose steep slopes, littered with loose boulders,
which threatened to roll down upon the wayfarer. Bare stone cliffs, reddish
in color, were much in evidence. There was little vegetation, except for low
stunted trees, of which the spread of their branches was equal to the height
of the trunk, and several varieties of thorny bushes, upon some of which grew
nuts of peculiar shape and color. I broke open several of these, finding the
kernel to be rich and meaty in appearance, but I dared not eat it, although I
was feeling the bite of hunger.</p>

<p>My thirst bothered me more than my hunger, and this at least I was able to
satisfy, although the satisfying nearly cost me my life. I clambered down a
precipitous steep and entered a narrow valley, enclosed by lofty cliffs, at
the foot of which the nut-bearing bushes grew in great abundance. In the
middle of the valley lay a broad pool, apparently fed by a spring. In the
center of the pool the water bubbled continuously, and a small stream led off
down the valley.</p>

<p>I approached the pool eagerly, and lying on my belly at its lush-grown
marge, plunged my muzzle into the crystal-clear water. It, too, might be
lethal for an Earthman, for all I knew, but I was so maddened with thirst
that I risked it. It had an unusual tang, a quality I have always found
present in Almuric water, but it was deliciously cold and satisfying. So
pleasant it was to my parched lips that after I had satisfied my thirst, I
lay there enjoying the sensation of tranquility. That was a mistake. Eat
quickly, drink quickly, sleep lightly, and linger not over
anything&mdash;those are the first rules of the wild, and his life is not
long who fails to observe them.</p>

<p>The warmth of the sun, the bubbling of the water, the sensuous feeling of
relaxation and satiation after fatigue and thirst&mdash;these wrought on me
like an opiate to lull me into semislumber. It must have been some
subconscious instinct that warned me, when a faint swishing reached my ears
that was not part of the rippling of the spring. Even before my mind
translated the sound as the passing of a heavy body through the tall grass, I
whirled on my side, snatching at my poniard.</p>

<p>Simultaneously my ears were stunned with a deafening roar, there was a
rushing through the air, and a giant form crashed down where I had lain an
instant before, so close to me that its outspread talons raked my thigh. I
had no time to tell the nature of my attacker&mdash;I had only a dazed
impression that it was huge, supple, and catlike. I rolled frantically aside
as it spat and struck at me sidewise; then it was on me, and even as I felt
its claws tear agonizingly into my flesh, the ice-cold water engulfed us
both. A catlike yowl rose half strangled, as if the yowler had swallowed a
large amount of water. There was a great splashing and thrashing about me;
then as I rose to the surface, I saw a long, bedraggled shape disappearing
around the bushes near the cliffs. What it was I could not say, but it looked
more like a leopard than anything else, though it was bigger than any leopard
I had ever seen.</p>

<p>Scanning the shore carefully, I saw no other enemy, and crawled out of the
pool, shivering from my icy plunge. My poniard was still in its scabbard. I
had had no time to draw it, which was just as well. If I had not rolled into
the pool, just when I did, dragging my attacker with me, it would have been
my finish. Evidently the beast had a true catlike distaste for water.</p>

<p>I found that I had a deep gash in my thigh and four lesser abrasions on my
shoulder, where a great talon-armed paw had closed. The gash in my leg was
pouring blood, and I thrust the limb deep into the icy pool, swearing at the
excruciating sting of the cold water on the raw flesh. My leg was nearly numb
when the bleeding ceased.</p>

<p>I now found myself in a quandary. I was hungry, night was coming on, there
was no telling when the leopard-beast might return, or another predatory
animal attack me; more than that, I was wounded. Civilized man is soft and
easily disabled. I had a wound such as would be considered, among civilized
people, ample reason for weeks of an invalid's existence. Strong and
rugged as I was, according to Earth standards, I despaired when I surveyed
the wound, and wondered how I was to treat it. The matter was quickly taken
out of my hands.</p>

<p><br>I had started across the valley toward the cliffs, hoping I might find a
cave there, for the nip of the air warned me that the night would not be as
warm as the day, when a hellish clamor up near the mouth of the valley caused
me to wheel and glare in that direction. Over the ridge came what I thought
to be a pack of hyenas, except for their noise, which was more infernal than
an Earthly hyena, even, could produce. I had no illusions as to their
purpose. It was I they were after.</p>

<p>Necessity recognizes few limitations. An instant before I had been limping
painfully and slowly. Now I set out on a mad race for the cliff as if I were
fresh and unwounded. With every step a spasm of agony shot along my thigh,
and the wound, bleeding afresh, spurted red, but I gritted my teeth and
increased my efforts.</p>

<p>My pursuers gave tongue and raced after me with such appalling speed that
I had almost given up hope of reaching the trees beneath the cliffs before
they pulled me down. They were snapping at my heels when I lurched into the
low stunted growths, and swarmed up the spreading branches with a gasp of
relief. But to my horror the hyenas climbed after me! A desperate downward
glance showed me that they were not true hyenas; they differed from the breed
I had known just as everything on Almuric differed subtly from its nearest
counterpart on Earth. These beasts had curving catlike claws, and their
bodily structure was catlike enough to allow them to climb as well as a
lynx.</p>

<p>Despairingly, I was about to turn at bay, when I saw a ledge on the cliff
above my head. There the cliff was deeply weathered, and the branches pressed
against it. A desperate scramble up the perilous slant, and I had dragged my
scratched and bruised body up on the ledge and lay glaring down at my
pursuers, who loaded the topmost branches and howled up at me like lost
souls. Evidently their climbing ability did not include cliffs, because after
one attempt, in which one sprang up toward the ledge, clawed frantically for
an instant on the sloping stone wall, and then fell off with an awful shriek,
they made no effort to reach me.</p>

<p>Neither did they abandon their post. Stars came out, strange unfamiliar
constellations, that blazed whitely in the dark velvet skies, and a broad
golden moon rose above the cliffs, and flooded the hills with weird light;
but still my sentinels sat on the branches below me and howled up at me their
hatred and belly-hunger.</p>

<p>The air was icy, and frost formed on the bare stone where I lay. My limbs
became stiff and numb. I had knotted my girdle about my leg for a tourniquet;
the run had apparently ruptured some small veins laid bare by the wound,
because the blood flowed from it in an alarming manner.</p>

<p>I never spent a more miserable night. I lay on the frosty stone ledge,
shaking with cold. Below me the eyes of my hunters burned up at me.
Throughout the shadowy hills sounded the roaring and bellowing of unknown
monsters. Howls, screams and yapping cut the night. And there I lay, naked,
wounded, freezing, hungry, terrified, just as one of my remote ancestors
might have lain in the Paleolithic Age of my own planet.</p>

<p>I can understand why our heathen ancestors worshipped the sun. When at
last the cold moon sank and the sun of Almuric pushed its golden rim above
the distant cliffs, I could have wept for sheer joy. Below me the hyenas
snarled and stretched themselves, bayed up at me briefly, and loped away in
search of easier prey. Slowly the warmth of the sun stole through my cramped,
numbed limbs, and I rose stiffly up to greet the day, just as that forgotten
forbear of mine might have stood up in the youthdawn of the Earth.</p>

<p>After a while I descended, and fell upon the nuts clustered in the bushes
near by. I was faint from hunger, and decided that I had as soon die from
poisoning as from starvation. I broke open the thick shells and munched the
meaty kernels eagerly, and I cannot recall any Earthly meal, howsoever
elaborate, that tasted half as good. No ill effects followed; the nuts were
good and nutritious. I was beginning to overcome my surroundings, at least so
far as food was concerned. I had surmounted one obstacle of life on
Almuric.</p>

<p><br>It is needless for me to narrate the details of the following months. I
dwelt among the hills in such suffering and peril as no man on Earth has
experienced for thousands of years. I make bold to say that only a man of
extraordinary strength and ruggedness could have survived as I did. I did
more than survive. I came at last to thrive on the existence.</p>

<p>At first I dared not leave the valley, where I was sure of food and water.
I built a sort of nest of branches and leaves on the ledge, and slept there
at night. Slept? The word is misleading. I crouched there, trying to keep
from freezing, grimly lasting out the night. In the daytime I snatched naps,
learning to sleep anywhere, or at any time, and so lightly that the slightest
unusual noise would awaken me. The rest of the time I explored my valley and
the hills about, and picked and ate nuts. Nor were my humble explorations
uneventful. Time and again I raced for the cliffs or the trees, winning
sometimes by shuddering hairbreadths. The hills swarmed with beasts, and all
seemed predatory.</p>

<p>It was that fact which held me to my valley, where I at least had a bit of
safety. What drove me forth at last was the same reason that has always
driven forth the human race, from the first apeman down to the last European
colonist&mdash;the search for food. My supply of nuts became exhausted. The
trees were stripped. This was not altogether on my account, although I
developed a most ravenous hunger, what of my constant exertions; but others
came to eat the nuts&mdash;huge shaggy bearlike creatures, and things that
looked like fur-clad baboons. These animals ate nuts, but they were
omnivorous, to judge by the attention they accorded me. The bears were
comparatively easy to avoid; they were mountains of flesh and muscle, but
they could not climb, and their eyes were none too good. It was the baboons I
learned to fear and hate. They pursued me on sight, they could both run and
climb, and they were not balked by the cliff.</p>

<p>One pursued me to my eyrie, and swarmed up onto the ledge with me. At
least such was his intention, but man is always most dangerous when cornered.
I was weary of being hunted. As the frothing apish monstrosity hauled himself
up over my ledge, manlike, I drove my poniard down between his shoulders with
such fury that I literally pinned him to the ledge; the keen point sinking a
full inch into the solid stone beneath him.</p>

<p>The incident showed me both the temper of my steel, and the growing
quality of my own muscles. I who had been among the strongest on my own
planet, found myself a weakling on primordial Almuric. Yet the potentiality
of mastery was in my brain and my thews, and I was beginning to find
myself.</p>

<p>Since survival was dependent on toughening, I toughened. My skin, burnt
brown by the sun and hardened by the elements, became more impervious to both
heat and cold than I had deemed possible. Muscles I had not known I possessed
became evident. Such strength and suppleness became mine as Earthmen have not
known for ages.</p>

<p>A short time before I had been transported from my native planet, a noted
physical culture expert had pronounced me the most perfectly developed man on
Earth. As I hardened with my fierce life on Almuric, I realized that the
expert honestly had not known what physical development was. Nor had I. Had
it been possible to divide my being and set opposite each other the man that
expert praised, and the man I had become, the former would have seemed
ridiculously soft, sluggish and clumsy in comparison to the brown, sinewy
giant opposed to him.</p>

<p>I no longer turned blue with the cold at night, nor did the rockiest way
bruise my naked feet. I could swarm up an almost sheer cliff with the ease of
a monkey, I could run for hours without exhaustion; in short dashes it would
have taken a racehorse to outfoot me. My wounds, untended except for washing
in cold water, healed of themselves, as Nature is prone to heal the hurts of
such as live close to her.</p>

<p>All this I narrate in order that it may be seen what sort of a man was
formed in the savage mold. Had it not been for the fierce forging that made
me steel and rawhide, I could not have survived the grim bloody episodes
through which I was to pass on that wild planet.</p>

<p>With new realization of power came confidence. I stood on my feet and
stared at my bestial neighbors with defiance. I no longer fled from a
frothing, champing baboon. With them, at least, I declared feud, growing to
hate the abominable beasts as I might have hated human enemies. Besides, they
ate the nuts I wished for myself.</p>

<p>They soon learned not to follow me to my eyrie, and the day came when I
dared to meet one on even terms, I will never forget the sight of him
frothing and roaring as he charged out of a clump of bushes, and the awful
glare in his manlike eyes. My resolution wavered, but it was too late to
retreat, and I met him squarely, skewering him through the heart as he closed
in with his long clutching arms.</p>

<p>But there were other beasts which frequented the valley, and which I did
not attempt to meet on any terms: the hyenas, the sabertooth leopards, longer
and heavier than an Earthly tiger and more ferocious; giant mooselike
creatures, carnivorous, with alligator-like tusks; the monstrous bears;
gigantic boars, with bristly hair which looked impervious to a swordcut.
There were other monsters, which appeared only at night, and the details of
which I was not able to make out. These mysterious beasts moved mostly in
silence, though some emitted high-pitched weird wails, or low Earth-shaking
rumbles. As the unknown is most menacing, I had a feeling that these nighted
monsters were even more terrible than the familiar horrors which harried my
day-life.</p>

<p>I remember one occasion on which I awoke suddenly and found myself lying
tensely on my ledge, my ears strained to a night suddenly and breathlessly
silent. The moon had set and the valley was veiled in darkness. Not a
chattering baboon, not a yelping hyena disturbed the sinister stillness.
<i>Something</i> was moving through the valley; I heard the faint rhythmic
swishing of the grass that marked the passing of some huge body, but in the
darkness I made out only a dim gigantic shape, which somehow seemed
infinitely longer than it was broad&mdash;out of natural proportion, somehow.
It passed away up the valley, and with its going, it was as if the night
audibly expelled a gusty sigh of relief. The nocturnal noises started up
again, and I lay back to sleep once more with a vague feeling that some
grisly horror had passed me in the night.</p>

<p>I have said that I strove with the baboons over the possession of the
life-giving nuts. What of my own appetite and those of the beasts, there came
a time when I was forced to leave my valley and seek far afield in search of
nutriment. My explorations had become broader and broader, until I had
exhausted the resources of the country close about. So I set forth at random
through the hills in a southerly and easterly direction. Of my wanderings I
will deal briefly. For many weeks I roamed through the hills, starving,
feasting, threatened by savage beasts sleeping in trees or perilously on tall
rocks when night fell. I fled, I fought, I slew, I suffered wounds. Oh, I can
tell you my life was neither dull nor uneventful.</p>

<p>I was living the life of the most primitive savage; I had neither
companionship, books, clothing, nor any of the things which go to make up
civilization. According to the cultured viewpoint, I should have been most
miserable. I was not. I revelled in my existence. My being grew and expanded.
I tell you, the natural life of mankind is a grim battle for existence
against the forces of nature, and any other form of life is artificial and
without realistic meaning.</p>

<p>My life was not empty; it was crowded with adventures calling on every
ounce of intelligence and physical power. When I swung down from my chosen
eyrie at dawn, I knew that I would see the sun set only through my personal
craft and strength and speed. I came to read the meaning of every waving
grass tuft, each masking bush, each towering boulder. On every hand lurked
Death in a thousand forms. My vigilance could not be relaxed, even in sleep.
When I closed my eyes at night it was with no assurance that I would open
them at dawn. I was fully alive. That phrase has more meaning than appears on
the surface. The average civilized man is never fully alive; he is burdened
with masses of atrophied tissue and useless matter. Life flickers feebly in
him; his senses are dull and torpid. In developing his intellect he has
sacrificed far more than he realizes.</p>

<p>I realized that I, too, had been partly dead on my native planet. But now
I was alive in every sense of the word; I tingled and burned and stung with
life to the finger tips and the ends of my toes. Every sinew, vein, and
springy bone was vibrant with the dynamic flood of singing, pulsing, humming
life. My time was too much occupied with food-getting and preserving my skin
to allow the developing of the morbid and intricate complexes and inhibitions
which torment the civilized individual. To those highly complex persons who
would complain that the psychology of such a life is over-simple, I can but
reply that in my life at that time, violent and continual action and the
necessity of action crowded out most of the gropings and soul-searchings
common to those whose safety and daily meals are assured them by the toil of
others. My life <i>was</i> primitively simple; I dwelt altogether in the
present. My life on Earth already seemed like a dream, dim and far away.</p>

<p>All my life I had held down my instincts, had chained and enthralled my
over-abundant vitalities. Now I was free to hurl all my mental and physical
powers into the untamed struggle for existence, and I knew such zest and
freedom as I had never dreamed of.</p>

<p>In all my wanderings&mdash;and since leaving the valley I had covered an
enormous distance&mdash;I had seen no sign of humanity, or anything remotely
resembling humanity.</p>

<p><br>It was the day I glimpsed a vista of rolling grassland beyond the peaks,
that I suddenly encountered a human being. The meeting was unexpected. As I
strode along an upland plateau, thickly grown with bushes and littered with
boulders, I came abruptly on a scene striking in its primordial
significance.</p>

<p>Ahead of me the Earth sloped down to form a shallow bowl, the floor of
which was thickly grown with tall grass, indicating the presence of a spring.
In the midst of this bowl a figure similar to the one I had encountered on my
arrival on Almuric was waging an unequal battle with a sabertooth leopard. I
stared in amazement, for I had not supposed that any human could stand before
the great cat and live.</p>

<p>Always the glittering wheel of a sword shimmered between the monster and
its prey, and blood on the spotted hide showed that the blade had been
fleshed more than once. But it could not last; at any instant I expected to
see the swordsman go down beneath the giant body.</p>

<p>Even with the thought, I was running fleetly down the shallow slope. I
owed nothing to the unknown man, but his valiant battle stirred newly plumbed
depths in my soul. I did not shout but rushed in silently and murderously, my
poniard gleaming in my hand. Even as I reached them, the great cat sprang,
the sword went spinning from the wielder's hand, and he went down
beneath the hurtling bulk. And almost simultaneously I disembowled the
sabertooth with one tremendous ripping stroke.</p>

<p>With a scream it lurched off its victim, slashing murderously as I leaped
back, and then it began rolling and tumbling over the grass, roaring
hideously and ripping up the Earth with its frantic talons, in a ghastly
welter of blood and streaming entrails.</p>

<p>It was a sight to sicken the hardiest, and I was glad when the mangled
beast stiffened convulsively and lay still.</p>

<p>I turned to the man, but with little hope of finding life in him. I had
seen the terrible saberlike fangs of the giant carnivore tear into his throat
as he went down.</p>

<p>He was lying in a wide pool of blood, his throat horribly mangled. I could
see the pulsing of the great jugular vein which had been laid bare, though
not severed. One of the huge taloned paws had raked down his side from
arm-pit to hip, and his thigh had been laid open in a frightful manner; I
could see the naked bone, and from the ruptured veins blood was gushing. Yet
to my amazement the man was not only living, but conscious. Yet even as I
looked, his eyes glazed and the light faded in them.</p>

<p>I tore a strip from his loincloth and made a tourniquet about his thigh
which somewhat slackened the flow of blood; then I looked down at him
helplessly. He was apparently dying, though I knew something of the stamina
and vitality of the wild and its people. And such evidently this man was; he
was as savage and hairy in appearance, though not quite so bulky, as the man
I had fought during my first day on Almuric.</p>

<p>As I stood there helplessly, something whistled venomously past my ear and
thudded into the slope behind me. I saw a long arrow quivering there, and a
fierce shout reached my ears. Glaring about, I saw half a dozen hairy men
running fleetly toward me, fitting shafts to their bows as they came.</p>

<p>With an instinctive snarl I bounded up the short slope, the whistle of the
missiles about my head lending wings to my heels. I did not stop, once I had
gained the cover of the bushes surrounding the bowl, but went straight on,
wrathful and disgusted. Evidently men as well as beasts were hostile on
Almuric, and I would do well to avoid them in the future.</p>

<p>Then I found my anger submerged in a fantastic problem. I had understood
some of the shouts of the men as they rushed toward me. The words had been in
English, just as the antagonist of my first encounter had spoken and
understood that language. In vain I cudgeled my mind for a solution. I had
found that while animate and inanimate objects on Almuric often closely
copied things on Earth, yet there was almost a striking difference somewhere,
in substance, quality, shape or mode of action. It was preposterous that
certain conditions on the separate planets could run such a perfect parallel
as to produce an identical language. Yet I could not doubt the evidence of my
ears. With a curse I abandoned the problem as too fantastic to waste time
on.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was this incident, perhaps the glimpse of the distant savannas,
which filled me with a restlessness and distaste for the barren hill country
where I had fared so hardily. The sight of men, strange and alien as they
were, stirred in my breast a desire for human companionship, and this
frustrated longing became in turn a sudden feeling of repulsion for my
surroundings. I did not hope to meet friendly humans on the plains; but I
determined to try my chances upon them, nevertheless, though what perils I
might meet there I could not know. Before I left the hills some whim caused
me to scrape from my face my heavy growth and trim my shaggy hair with my
poniard, which had lost none of its razor edge. Why I did this I cannot say,
unless it was the natural instinct of a man setting forth into new country to
look his "best."</p>

<p><br>The next morning I descended into the grassy plains, which swept eastward
and southward as far as sight could reach. I continued eastward and covered
many miles that day, without any unusual incident. I encountered several
small winding rivers, along whose margins the grass stood taller than my
head. Among this grass I heard the snorting and thrashing of heavy animals of
some sort, and gave them a wide berth&mdash;for which caution I was later
thankful.</p>

<p>The rivers were thronged in many cases with gaily colored birds of many
shapes and hues, some silent, others continually giving forth strident cries
as they wheeled above the waters or dipped down to snatch their prey from its
depths.</p>

<p>Further out on the plain I came upon herds of grazing animals&mdash;small
deerlike creatures, and a curious animal that looked like a pot-bellied pig
with abnormally long hind legs, and that progressed in enormous bounds, after
the fashion of a kangaroo. It was a most ludicrous sight, and I laughed until
my belly ached. Later I reflected that it was the first time I had
laughed&mdash;outside of a few short barks of savage satisfaction at the
discomfiture of an enemy&mdash;since I had set foot on Almuric.</p>

<p>That night I slept in the tall grass not far from a water course, and
might have been made the prey of any wandering meat-eater. But fortune was
with me that night. All across the plains sounded the thunderous roaring of
stalking monsters, but none came near my frail retreat. The night was warm
and pleasant, strikingly in contrast with the nights in the chill grim
hills.</p>

<p>The next day a momentous thing occurred. I had had no meat on Almuric,
except when ravenous hunger had driven me to eat raw flesh. I had searched in
vain for some stone that would strike a spark. The rocks were of a peculiar
nature, unknown to Earth. But that morning on the plains, I found a bit of
greenish-looking stone lying in the grass, and experiments showed that it had
some of the qualities of flint. Patient effort, in which I clinked my poniard
against the stone, rewarded me with a spark of fire in the dry grass, which I
soon fanned to a blaze&mdash;and had some difficulty in extinguishing.</p>

<p>That night I surrounded myself with a ring of fire which I fed with dry
grass and stalked plants which burned slowly and I felt comparatively safe,
though huge forms moved about me in the darkness, and I caught the stealthy
pad of great paws, and the glimmer of wicked eyes.</p>

<p>On my journey across the plains I subsisted on fruit I found growing on
green stalks, which I saw the birds eating. It was pleasant to the taste,
though lacking in the nutritive qualities of the nuts in the hills. I looked
longingly at the scampering deerlike animals, now that I had the means of
cooking their flesh, but saw no way of securing them.</p>

<p>And so for days I wandered aimlessly across those vast plains, until I
came in sight of a massive walled city.</p>

<p>I sighted it just at nightfall, and eager though I was to investigate it
further, I made my camp and waited for morning. I wondered if my fire would
be seen by the inhabitants, and if they would send out a party to discover my
nature and purpose.</p>

<p>With the fall of night I could no longer make it out, but the last waning
light had shown it plainly, rising stark and somber against the eastern sky.
At that distance no evidence of life was visible, but I had a dim impression
of huge walls and massive towers, all of a greenish tint.</p>

<p>I lay within my circle of fire, while great sinuous bodies rustled through
the grass and fierce eyes glared at me, and my imagination was at work as I
strove to visualize the possible inhabitants of that mysterious city. Would
they be of the same race as the hairy ferocious troglodytes I had
encountered? I doubted it, for it hardly seemed possible that these primitive
creatures would be capable of rearing such a structure. Perhaps there I would
find a highly developed type of cultured man. Perhaps&mdash;here imaginings
too dark and shadowy for description whispered at the back of my
consciousness.</p>

<p>Then the moon rose behind the city, etching its massive outlines in the
weird golden glow. It looked black and somber in the moonlight; there was
something distinctly brutish and forbidding about its contours. As I sank
into slumber I reflected that if apemen could build a city, it would surely
resemble that colossus in the moon.</p>
<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="almuric2"
name="almuric2">CHAPTER 2</a></h2>

<p class="first">DAWN FOUND ME on my way across the plain. It may seem like
the height of folly to have gone striding openly toward the city, which might
be full of hostile beings, but I had learned to take desperate chances, and I
was consumed with curiosity; weary at last of my lonely life.</p>

<p>The nearer I approached, the more rugged the details stood out. There was
more of the fortress than the city about the walls, which, with the tower
that loomed behind and above them, seemed to have been built of huge blocks
of greenish stone, very roughly cut. There was no apparent attempt at
smoothing, polishing, or otherwise adorning this stone. The whole appearance
was rude and savage, suggesting a wild fierce people heaping up rocks as a
defense against enemies.</p>

<p>As yet I had seen nothing of the inhabitants. The city might have been
empty of human life. But a broad road leading to the massive gate was beaten
bare of grass, as if by the constant impact of many feet. There were no
fields or gardens about the city; the grass waved to the foot of the walls.
All during that long march across the plain to the gates, I saw nothing
resembling a human being. But as I came under the shadow of the great gate,
which was flanked on either hand by a massive tower, I caught a glimpse of
tousled black heads moving along the squat battlements. I halted and threw
back my head to hail them. The sun had just topped the towers and its glare
was full in my eyes. Even as I opened my lips, there was a cracking report
like a rifle shot, a jet of white smoke spurted from a tower, and a terrific
impact against my head dashed me into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>When I came to my senses it was not slowly, but quickly and
clear-headedly, what with my immense recuperative powers. I was lying on a
bare stone floor in a large chamber, the walls, ceiling and floor of which
were composed of huge blocks of green stone. From a barred window high up in
one wall sunlight poured to illuminate the room, which was without
furnishing, except for a bench, crudely and massively built.</p>

<p>A heavy chain was looped about my waist and made fast with a strange,
heavy lock. The other end of the chain was fastened to a thick ring set in
the wall. Everything about the fantastic city seemed massive.</p>

<p>Lifting a hand to my head, I found it was bandaged with something that
felt like silk. My head throbbed. Evidently whatever missile it was that had
been fired at me from the wall, had only grazed my head, inflicting a scalp
wound and knocking me senseless. I felt for my poniard, but naturally it was
gone.</p>

<p>I cursed heartily. When I had found myself on Almuric I had been appalled
by my prospects; but then at least I had been free. Now I was in the hands of
God only knew what manner of beings. All I knew was that they were hostile.
But my inordinate self-confidence would not down, and I felt no great fear. I
did feel a rush of panic, common to all wild things, at being confined and
shackled, but I fought down this feeling and it was succeeded by one of red
unreasoning rage. Springing to my feet, which movement the chain was long
enough to allow, I began jerking and tearing at my shackle.</p>

<p><br>It was while engaged in this fruitless exhibition of primitive resentment
that a slight noise caused me to wheel, snarling, my muscles tensed for
attack or defense. What I saw froze me in my tracks.</p>

<p>Just within the doorway stood a girl. Except in her garments she differed
little from the type of girls I had known on Earth, except that her slim
figure exhibited a suppleness superior to theirs. Her hair was intensely
black, her skin white as alabaster. Her lissome limbs were barely concealed
by a light, tuniclike garment, sleeveless, low-necked, revealing the greater
part of her ivory breasts. This garment was girdled at her lithe waist, and
came to within a few inches above her knees. Soft sandals encased her slender
feet. She was standing in an attitude of awed fascination, her dark eyes
wide, her crimson lips parted. As I wheeled and glared at her, she gave back
with a quick gasp of surprise or fear, and fled lightly from the chamber.</p>

<p>I stared after her. If she were typical of the people of the city, then
surely the effect produced by the brutish masonry was an illusion, for she
seemed the product of some gentle and refined civilization, allowing for a
certain barbaric suggestion about her costume.</p>

<p>While so musing, I heard the tramp of feet, harsh voices were lifted in
argument, and the next instant a group of men strode into the chamber,
halting as they saw me conscious and on my feet. Still thinking of the girl,
I glared at them in surprise. They were of the same type as the others I had
seen, huge, hairy, ferocious, with the same apelike forward-thrust heads and
formidable faces. Some, I noticed, were darker than others, but all were dark
and fierce, and the whole effect was one of somber and ferocious savagery.
They were instinct with ferocity; it blazed in their icy-gray eyes, reflected
in the snarling lift of their bristling lips, rumbled in their rough
voices.</p>

<p>All were armed, and their hands seemed instinctively to seek their hilts
as they stood glaring at me, their shaggy heads thrust forward in their
apelike manner.</p>

<p>"Thak!" one exclaimed, or rather roared&mdash;all their voices
were as gusty as a sea wind&mdash;"he's conscious!"</p>

<p>"Do you suppose he can speak or understand human language?"
rumbled another.</p>

<p>All this while I had stood glaring back at them, wondering anew at their
speech. Now I realized that they were not speaking English.</p>

<p>The thing was so unnatural that it gave me a shock. They were not speaking
any Earthly language, and I realized it, yet I understood them, except for
various words which apparently had no counterpart on Earth. I made no attempt
to understand this seemingly impossible phenomenon, but answered the last
speaker.</p>

<p>"I can speak and understand." I grunted. "Who are you?
What city is this? Why did you attack me? Why am I in chains?"</p>

<p>They rumbled in amazement, with much tugging of mustaches, shaking of
heads, and uncouth profanity.</p>

<p>"He talks, by Thak!" said one. "I tell you, he is from
beyond the Girdle!"</p>

<p>"From beyond my hip!" broke in another rudely. "He is a
freak, a damned, smooth-skinned degenerate misfit which should not have been
born, or allowed to exist."</p>

<p>"Ask him how he came by the Bonecrusher's poniard," requested yet another.</p>

<p>>At that, one of them advanced and, fixing me with a stern and
accusing eye, held out a sheathed weapon which I recognised as my
poniard.

<p>"Did you steal this from Logar?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I stole nothing!" I snapped, feeling like a wild beast being
prodded through the bars of a cage by unfeeling and critical spectators. My
rages, like all the emotions on that wild planet, were without restraint.</p>

<p>"I took that poniard from the man who carried it, and I took it in a
fair fight," I added.</p>

<p>"Did you slay him?" they demanded unbelievingly.</p>

<p>"No," I growled. "We fought with our bare hands, until
he tried to knife me. Then I knocked him senseless."</p>

<p><br>A roar greeted my words. I thought at first they were clamoring with rage;
then I made out that they were arguing among themselves.</p>

<p>"I tell you he lies!" one bull's bellow rose above the
tumult. "We all know that Logar the Bonecrusher is not the man to be
thrashed and stripped by a smooth-skinned hairless brown man like this. Ghor
the Bear might be a match for Logar. No one else."</p>

<p>"Well, there's the poniard," someone pointed out.</p>

<p>The clamor rose again, and in an instant the disputants were yelling and
cursing, and brandishing their hairy fists in one another's faces,
hands fumbled at sword hilts, and challenges and defiances were exchanged
freely.</p>

<p>I looked to see a general throat-cutting, but presently one who seemed in
some authority drew his sword and began banging the hilt on the rude bench,
at the same time drowning out the voices of the others with his bull-like
bellowing.</p>

<p>"Shut up! Shut up! Let another man open his mouth and I'll
split his head!" As the clamor subsided and the disputants glared
venomously at him, he continued in a voice as calm as if nothing had
occurred. "It's neither here nor there about the poniard. He
might have caught Logar sleeping and brained him, or he might have stolen it,
or found it. Are we Logar's brothers, that we should seek after his
welfare?"</p>

<p>A general snarl answered this. Evidently the man called Logar was not
popular among them.</p>

<p>"The question is, what shall we do with this creature? We've
got to hold a council and decide. He's evidently uneatable." He
grinned as he said this, which was apparently meant as a bit of grim
humor.</p>

<p>"His hide would make good leather." suggested another in a
tone that did not sound as though he was joking.</p>

<p>"Too soft," protested another.</p>

<p>"He didn't feel soft while we were carrying him in,"
returned the first speaker. "He was hard as steel springs."</p>

<p>"Tush," deprecated the other. "I'll show you how
tender his flesh is. Watch me slice off a few strips." He drew his
dagger and approached me while the others watched with interest.</p>

<p>All this time my rage had been growing until the chamber seemed to swim in
a red mist. Now, as I realized that the fellow really intended trying the
edge of his steel on my skin I went berserk. Wheeling, I gripped the chain
with both hands, wrapping it around my wrists for more leverage. Then,
bracing my feet against the floor and walls I began to strain with all my
strength. All over my body the great muscles coiled and knotted; sweat broke
out on my skin, and then with a shattering crash the stone gave way, the iron
ring was torn out bodily, and I was catapulted on my back onto the floor, at
the feet of my captors who roared with amazement and fell on me <i>en
masse</i>.</p>

<p><br>I answered their bellows with one strident yell of blood-thirsty
gratification, and heaving up through the melee, began swinging my heavy
fists like caulking mallets. Oh, that was a rough-house while it lasted! They
made no attempt to knife me, striving to swamp me with numbers. We rolled
from one side of the chamber to the other, a gasping, thrashing, cursing,
hammering mass, while with the yells, howls, earnest profanity, and impact of
heavy bodies, it was a perfect bedlam. Once I seemed to catch a fleeting
glimpse of the door thronged with the heads of women similar to the one I had
seen, but I could not be sure; my teeth were set in a hairy ear, my eyes were
full of sweat and stars from a vicious punch on the nose, and what with a
gang of heavy forms romping all over me my sight was none too good.</p>

<p>Yet, I gave a good account of myself. Ears split, noses crumpled and teeth
splintered under the crushing impact of my iron-hard fists, and the yells of
the wounded were music to my battered ears. But that damnable chain about my
waist kept tripping me and coiling about my legs, and pretty soon the bandage
was ripped from my head, my scalp wound opened anew and deluged me with
blood. Blinded by this I floundered and stumbled, and gasping and panting
they bore me down and bound my arms and legs.</p>

<p>The survivors then fell away from me and lay or sat in positions of pain
and exhaustion while I, finding my voice, cursed them luridly. I derived
ferocious satisfaction at the sight of all the bloody noses, black eyes, torn
ears and smashed teeth which were in evidence, and barked in vicious laughter
when one announced with many curses that his arm was broken. One of them was
out cold, and had to be revived, which they did by dumping over him a vessel
of cold water that was fetched by someone I could not see from where I lay. I
had no idea that it was a woman who came in answer to a harsh roar of
command.</p>

<p>"His wound is open again," said one, pointing at me.
"He'll bleed to death."</p>

<p>"I hope he does," snarled another, lying doubled up on the
floor. "He's burst my belly. I'm dying. Get me some
wine."</p>

<p>"If you're dying you don't need wine," brutally
answered the one who seemed a chief, as he spat out bits of splintered teeth.
"Tie up his wound, Akra."</p>

<p>Akra limped over to me with no great enthusiasm and bent down.</p>

<p>"Hold your damnable head still," he growled.</p>

<p>"Keep off!" I snarled. "I'll have nothing from
you. Touch me at your peril."</p>

<p>He exasperatedly grabbed my face in his broad hand and shoved me violently
down. That was a mistake. My jaws locked on his thumb, evoking an
ear-splitting howl, and it was only with the aid of his comrades that he
extricated the mangled member. Maddened by the pain, he howled wordlessly,
then suddenly gave me a terrific kick in the temple, driving my wounded head
with great violence back against the massive bench leg. Once again I lost
consciousness.</p>

<p>When I came to myself again I was once more bandaged, shackled by the
wrists and ankles, and made fast to a fresh ring, newly set in the stone, and
apparently more firmly fixed than the other had been. It was night. Through
the window I glimpsed the star-dotted sky. A torch which burned with a
peculiar white flame was thrust into a niche in the wall, and a man sat on
the bench, elbows on knees and chin on fists, regarding me intently. On the
bench near him stood a huge gold vessel.</p>

<p>"I doubted if you'd come to after that last crack," he
said at last.</p>

<p>"It would take more than that to finish me," I snarled.
"You are a pack of cursed weaklings. But for my wound and that infernal
chain, I'd have bested the whole mob of you."</p>

<p>My insults seemed to interest rather than anger him. He absently fingered
a large bump on his head on which blood was thickly clotted, and asked:
"Who are you? Whence do you come?"</p>

<p>"None of your business," I snapped.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and lifting the vessel in one hand drew his
dagger with the other.</p>

<p>"In Koth none goes hungry," he said, "I'm going to
place this food near your hand and you can eat. But I warn you, if you try to
strike or bite me, I'll stab you."</p>

<p>I merely snarled truculently, and he bent and set down the bowl, hastily
withdrawing. I found the food to be a kind of stew, satisfying both thirst
and hunger. Having eaten I felt in somewhat better mood, and my guard renewed
his questions, I answered: "My name is Esau Cairn. I am an American,
from the planet Earth."</p>

<p>He mulled over my statements for a space, then asked: "Are these
places beyond the Girdle?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," I answered.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Nor I you. But if you do not know of the Girdle,
you cannot be from beyond it. Doubtless it is all fable, anyway. But whence
did you come when we saw you approaching across the plain? Was that your fire
we glimpsed from the towers last night?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," I replied. "For many months I have lived
in the hills to the west. It was only a few weeks ago that I descended into
the plains."</p>

<p>He stared and stared at me.</p>

<p>"In the hills? Alone, and with only a poniard?"</p>

<p>"Well, what about it?" I demanded.</p>

<p><br>He shook his head as if in doubt or wonder. "A few hours ago I would
have called you a liar. Now I am not sure."</p>

<p>"What is the name of this city?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Koth, of the Kothan tribe. Our chief is Khossuth Skull-splitter. I
am Thab the Swift. I am detailed to guard you while the warriors hold
council."</p>

<p>"What's the nature of their council?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"They discuss what shall be done with you; and they have been
arguing since sunset, and are no nearer a solution than before."</p>

<p>"What is their disagreement?"</p>

<p>"Well," he answered. "Some want to hang you, and some
want to shoot you."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose it's occurred to them that they might
let me go," I suggested with some bitterness.</p>

<p>He gave me a cold look. "Don't be a fool," he said
reprovingly.</p>

<p>At that moment a light step sounded outside, and the girl I had seen
before tiptoed into the chamber. Thab eyed her disapprovingly.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, Altha?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I came to look again at the stranger," she answered in a soft
musical voice. "I never saw a man like him. His skin is nearly as
smooth as mine, and he has no hair on his countenance. How strange are his
eyes! Whence does he come?"</p>

<p>"From the hills, he says," grunted Thab.</p>

<p>Her eyes widened.
"Why, none dwells in the hills, except wild beasts! Can it be that he
is some sort of animal? They say he speaks and understands speech."</p>

<p>"So he does," growled Thab, fingering his bruises. "He
also knocks out men's brains with his naked fists, which are harder and
heavier than maces. Get away from there.</p>

<p>"He's a rampaging devil. If he gets his hands on you he
won't leave enough of you for the vultures to pick."</p>

<p>"I won't get near him," she assured him. "But,
Thab, he does not look so terrible. See, there is no anger in the gaze he
fixes on me. What will be done with him?"</p>

<p>"The tribe will decide," he answered. "Probably let him
fight a sabertooth leopard bare-handed."</p>

<p>She clasped her own hands with more human feeling than I had yet seen
shown on Almuric.</p>

<p>"Oh, Thab, why? He has done no harm; he came alone and with empty
hands. The warriors shot him down without warning&mdash;and
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>He glanced at her in irritation. "If I told your father you were
pleading for a captive&mdash;"</p>

<p>Evidently the threat carried weight. She visibly wilted.</p>

<p>"Don't tell him," she pleaded. Then she flared up again.
"Whatever you say, it's beastly! If my father whips me until the
blood runs over my heels, I'll still say so!"</p>

<p>And so saying, she ran quickly out of the chamber.</p>

<p>"Who is that girl?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Altha, the daughter of Zal the Thrower."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"One of those you battled so viciously a short time ago."</p>

<p>"You mean to tell me a girl like that is the daughter of a man
like&mdash;" Words failed me.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with her?" he demanded. "She differs
none from the rest of our women."</p>

<p>"You mean all the women look like her, and all the men look like
you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;allowing for their individual characteristics. Is
it otherwise among your people? That is, if you are not a solitary
freak."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be&mdash;" I began in bewilderment, when
another warrior appeared in the door, saying.</p>

<p>"I'm to relieve you, Thab. The warriors have decide to leave
the matter to Khossuth when he returns on the morrow."</p>

<p>Thab departed and the other seated himself on the bench. I made no attempt
to talk to him. My head was swimming with the contradictory phenomena I had
heard and observed, and I felt the need of sleep. I soon sank into dreamless
slumber.</p>

<p>Doubtless my wits were still addled from the battering I had received.
Otherwise I would have snapped awake when I felt something touch my hair. As
it was, I woke only partly. From under drooping lids I glimpsed, as in a
dream, a girlish face bent close to mine, dark eyes wide with frightened
fascination, red lips parted. The fragrance of her foamy black hair was in my
nostrils. She timidly touched my face, then drew back with a quick soft
intake of breath, as if frightened by her action. The guard snored on the
bench. The torch had burned to a stub that cast a weird dull glow over the
chamber. Outside, the moon had set. This much I vaguely realized before I
sank back into slumber again, to be haunted by a dim beautiful face that
shimmered through my dreams.</p>

<br>

<h2><a id="almuric3"
name="almuric3">CHAPTER 3</a></h2>

<p class="first">I AWOKE AGAIN in the cold gray light of dawn, at a time when
the condemned meet their executioners. A group of men stood over me, and one
I knew was Khossuth the Skullsplitter.</p>

<p>He was taller than most, and leaner&mdash;almost gaunt in comparison to
the others. This circumstance made his broad shoulders seem abnormally huge.
His face and body were seamed with old scars. He was very dark, and
apparently old; an impressive and terrible image of somber savagery.</p>

<p>He stood looking down at me, fingering the hilt of his great sword. His
gaze was gloomy and detached.</p>

<p>"They say you claim to have beaten Logar of Thurga in open
fight," he said at last, and his voice was cavernous and ghostly in a
manner I cannot describe.</p>

<p>I did not reply, but lay staring up at him, partly in fascination at his
strange and menacing appearance, partly in the anger that seemed generally to
be with me during those times.</p>

<p>"Why do you not answer?" he rumbled.</p>

<p>"Because I'm weary of being called a liar," I
snarled.</p>

<p>"Why did you come to Koth?"</p>

<p>"Because I was tired of living alone among wild beasts. I was a
fool. I thought I would find human beings whose company was preferable to the
leopards and baboons. I find I was wrong."</p>

<p>He tugged his bristling mustaches.</p>

<p>"Men say you fight like a mad leopard. Thab says that you did not
come to the gates as an enemy comes. I love brave men. But what can we do? If
we free you, you will hate us because of what has passed, and your hate is
not lightly to be loosed."</p>

<p>"Why not take me into the tribe?" I remarked, at random.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "We are not Yagas, to keep slaves."</p>

<p>"Nor am I a slave," I grunted. "Let me live among you as
an equal. I will hunt and fight with you. I am as good a man as any of your
warriors."</p>

<p>At this another pushed past Khossuth. This fellow was bigger than any I
had yet seen in Koth&mdash;not taller, but broader, more massive. His hair
was thicker on his limbs, and of a peculiar rusty cast instead of black.</p>

<p>"That you must prove!" he roared, with an oath. "Loose
him, Khossuth! The warriors have been praising his power until my belly
revolts! Loose him and let us have a grapple!"</p>

<p>"The man is wounded, Ghor," answered Khossuth.</p>

<p>"Then let him be cared for until his wound is healed," urged
the warrior eagerly, spreading his arms in a curious grappling gesture.</p>

<p>"His fists are like hammers," warned another.</p>

<p>"Thak's devils!" roared Ghor, his eyes glaring, his
hairy arms brandished. "Admit him into the tribe, Khossuth! Let him
endure the test! If he survives&mdash;well, by Thak, he'll be worthy
even to be called a man of Koth!"</p>

<p>"I will go and think upon the matter," answered Khossuth after
a long deliberation.</p>

<p>That settled the matter for the time being. All trooped out after him.
Thab was last, and at the door he turned and made a gesture which I took to
be one of encouragement. These strange people seemed not entirely without
feelings of pity and friendship.</p>

<p><br>The day passed uneventfully. Thab did not return. Other warriors brought
me food and drink, and I allowed them to bandage my scalp. With more human
treatment the wild-beast fury in me had been subordinated to my human reason.
But that fury lurked close to the surface of my soul, ready to blaze into
ferocious life at the slightest encroachment.</p>

<p>I did not see the girl Altha, though I heard light footsteps outside the
chamber several times, whether hers or another's I could not know.</p>

<p>About nightfall a group of warriors came into the room and announced that
I was to be taken to the council, where Khossuth would listen to all
arguments and decide my fate. I was surprised to learn that arguments would
be presented on my behalf. They got my promise not to attack them, and loosed
me from the chain that bound me to the wall, but they did not remove the
shackles on my wrists and ankles.</p>

<p>I was escorted out of the chamber into a vast hall, lighted by white fire
torches. There were no hangings or furnishings, nor any sort of
ornamentation&mdash;just an almost oppressive sense of massive
architecture.</p>

<p>We traversed several halls, all equally huge and windy, with rugged walls
and lofty ceilings, and came at last into a vast circular space, roofed with
a dome. Against the back wall a stone throne stood on a block-like dais, and
on the throne sat old Khossuth in gloomy majesty, clad in a spotted
leopardskin. Before him in a vast three-quarters circle sat the tribe, the
men cross-legged on skins spread on the stone floor, and behind them the
women and children seated on fur-covered benches.</p>

<p>It was a strange concourse. The contrast was startling between the hairy
males and the slender, white-skinned, dainty women. The men were clad in
loincloths and high-strapped sandals; some had thrown pantherskins over their
massive shoulders. The women were dressed similar to the girl Altha, whom I
saw sitting with the others. They wore soft sandals or none, and scanty
tunics girdled about their waists. That was all. The difference of the sexes
was carried out down to the smallest babies. The girl children were quiet,
dainty and pretty. The young males looked even more like monkeys than did
their elders.</p>

<p>I was told to take my seat on a block of stone in front and somewhat to
the side of the dais. Sitting among the warriors I saw Ghor, squirming
impatiently as he unconsciously flexed his thick biceps.</p>

<p>As soon as I had taken my seat, the proceedings went forward. Khossuth
simply announced that he would hear the arguments, and pointed out a man to
represent me, at which I was again surprised, but this apparently was a
regular custom among these people. The man chosen was the lesser chief who
had commanded the warriors I had battled in the cell, and they called him
Gutchluk Tigerwrath. He eyed me venemously as he limped forward with no great
enthusiasm, bearing the marks of our encounter.</p>

<p>He laid his sword and dagger on the dais, and the foremost warriors did
likewise. Then he glared at the rest truculently, and Khossuth called for
arguments to show why Esau Cairn&mdash;he made a marvelous jumble of the
pronunciation&mdash;should not be taken into the tribe.</p>

<p>Apparently the reasons were legion. Half a dozen warriors sprang up and
began shouting at the top of their voice, while Gutchluk dutifully strove to
answer them. I felt already doomed. But the game was not played out, or even
well begun. At first Gutchluk went at it only half-heartedly, but opposition
heated him to his talk. His eyes blazed, his jaw jutted, and he began to roar
and bellow with the best of them. From the arguments he presented, or rather
thundered, one would have thought he and I were lifelong friends.</p>

<p>No particular person was designated to protest against me. Everybody who
wished took a hand. And if Gutchluk won over anyone, that person joined his
voice to Gutchluk's. Already there were men on my side. Thab's
shout and Ghor's bellow vied with my attorney's roar, and soon
others took up my defense.</p>

<p><br>That debate is impossible for an Earthman to conceive of, without having
witnessed it. It was sheer bedlam, with from three voices to five hundred
voices clamoring at once. How Khossuth sifted any sense out of it, I cannot
even guess. But he brooded somberly above the tumult, like a grim god over
the paltry aspirations of mankind.</p>

<p>There was wisdom in the discarding of weapons. Dispute frequently became
biting, and criticisms of ancestors and personal habits entered into it.
Hands clutched at empty belts and mustaches bristled belligerently.
Occasionally Khossuth lifted his weird voice across the clamor and restored a
semblance of order.</p>

<p>My attempts to follow the arguments were vain. My opponents went into
matters seemingly utterly irrelevant, and were met by rebuttals just as
illogical. Authorities of antiquity were dragged out, to be refuted by
records equally musty.</p>

<p>To further complicate matters, disputants frequently snared themselves in
their own arguments, or forgot which side they were on, and found themselves
raging frenziedly on the other. There seemed no end to the debate, and no
limit to the endurance of the debaters. At midnight they were still yelling
as loudly, and shaking their fists in one another's beards as violently
as ever.</p>

<p>The women took no part in the arguments.</p>

<p>They began to glide away about midnight, with the children. Finally only
one small figure was left among the benches. It was Altha, who was
following&mdash;or trying to follow&mdash;the proceedings with a surprising
interest.</p>

<p>I had long since given up the attempt. Gutchluk was holding the floor
valiantly, his veins swelling and his hair and beard bristling with his
exertions. Ghor was actually weeping with rage and begging Khossuth to let
him break a few necks. Oh, that he had lived to see the men of Koth become
adders and snakes, with the hearts of buzzards and the guts of toads! he
bawled, brandishing his huge arms to high heaven.</p>

<p>It was all a senseless madhouse to me. Finally, in spite of the clamor,
and the fact that my life was being weighed in the balance, I fell asleep on
my block and snored peacefully while the men of Koth raged and pounded their
hairy breasts and bellowed, and the strange planet of Almuric whirled on its
way under the stars that neither knew nor cared for men, Earthly or
otherwise.</p>

<p>It was dawn when Thab shook me awake and shouted in my ear: "We have
won! You enter the tribe, if you'll wrestle Ghor!"</p>

<p>"I'll break his back!" I grunted, and went back to sleep
again.</p>
<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="almuric4"
name="almuric4">CHAPTER 4</a></h2>

<p class="first">SO BEGAN my life as a man among men on Almuric. I who had
begun my new life as a naked savage, now took the next step on the ladder of
evolution and became a barbarian. For the men of Koth were barbarians, for
all their silks and steel and stone towers. Their counterpart is not on Earth
today, nor has it ever been. But of that later. Let me tell first of my
battle with Ghor the Bear.</p>

<p>My chains were removed and I was taken to a stone tower on the wall, there
to dwell until my wounds had healed. I was still a prisoner. Food and drink
were brought me regularly by the tribesmen, who also tended carefully to my
wounds, which were unimportant, considering the hurts I had had from wild
beasts, and had recovered from unaided. But they wished me to be in prime
condition for the wrestling, which was to decide whether I should be admitted
to the tribe of Koth, or&mdash;well, from what they said of Ghor, if I lost
there would be no problem as to my disposition. The wolves and vultures would
take care of that.</p>

<p>Their manner toward me was noncommittal, with the exception of Thab the
Swift, who was frankly cordial to me. I saw neither Khossuth, Ghor nor
Gutchluk during the time I was imprisoned in the tower, nor did I see the
girl Altha.</p>

<p>I do not remember a more tedious and wearisome time. I was not nervous
because of any fear of Ghor; I frankly doubted my ability to beat him, but I
had risked my life so often and against such fearful odds, that personal fear
had been stamped out of my soul. But for months I had lived like a mountain
panther, and now to be caged up in a stone tower, where my movements were
limited, bounded and restricted&mdash;it was intolerable, and if I had been
forced to put up with it a day longer, I would have lost control of myself,
and either fought my way to freedom or perished in the attempt. As it was,
all the constrained energy in me was pent up almost to the snapping point,
giving me a terrific store of nervous power which stood me in good stead in
my battle.</p>

<p>There is no man on Earth equal in sheer strength to any man of Koth. They
lived barbaric lives, filled with continuous peril and warfare against foes
human and bestial. But after all, they lived the lives of men, and I had been
living the life of a wild beast.</p>

<p>As I paced my tower chamber, I thought of a certain great wrestling
champion of Europe with whom I had once contested in a friendly private bout,
and who pronounced me the strongest man he had ever encountered. Could he
have seen me now, in the tower of Koth! I am certain that I could have torn
out his biceps like rotten cloth, broken his spine across my knee, or caved
in his breastbone with my clenched fist; and as for speed, the most finely
trained Earth athlete would have seemed awkward and sluggish in comparison to
the tigerish quickness lurking in my rippling sinews.</p>

<p>Yet for all that, I knew that I would be strained to the uttermost even to
hold my own with the giant they called Ghor the Bear. He did, indeed,
resemble a shaggy rusty-hued cave-bear.</p>

<p>Thab the Swift narrated some of his triumphs to me, and such a record of
personal mayhem I never heard; the man's progress through life was
marked by broken limbs, backs and necks. No man had yet stood before him in
barehanded battle, though some swore Logar the Bonecrusher was his equal.</p>

<p>Logar, I learned, was chief of Thugra, a city hostile to Koth. All cities
on Almuric seemed to be hostile to each other, the people of the planet being
divided into many small tribes, incessantly at war. The chief of Thugra was
called the Bonecrusher because of his terrible strength. The poniard I had
taken from him had been his favorite weapon, a famous blade, forged, Thab
said, by a supernatural smith. Thab called this being a <i>gorka</i>, and I
found in tales concerning the creature an analogy to the dwarfish
metalworkers of the ancient Germanic myths of my own world.</p>

<p>Thab told me much concerning his people and his planet, but of these
things I will deal later. At last Khossuth came, found my wounds completely
cured, eyed my bronzed sinews with a shadow of respect in his cold brooding
eyes, and pronounced me fit for battle.</p>

<p><br>Night had fallen when I was led into the streets of Koth. I looked with
wonder at the giant walls towering above me, dwarfing their human
inhabitants. Everything in Koth was built on a heroic scale. Neither the
walls nor the edifices were unusually high, in comparison to their bulk, but
they were so massive. My guides led me to a sort of amphitheater near the
outer wall. It was an oval space surrounded by huge stone blocks, rising tier
upon tier, and forming seats for the spectators. The open space in the center
was hard ground, covered with short grass. A sort of bulwark was formed about
it out of woven leather thongs, apparently to keep the contestants from
dashing their heads against the surrounding stones. Torches lighted the
scene.</p>

<p>The spectators were already there, the men occupying the lower blocks, the
women and children the upper. My gaze roved over the sea of faces, hairy or
smooth, until it rested on one I recognized, and I felt a strange throb of
pleasure at the sight of Altha sitting there watching me with her intent dark
eyes.</p>

<p>Thab indicated for me to enter the arena, and I did so, thinking of the
old-time bare-knuckled bouts of my own planet, which were fought in crude
rings pitched, like this, on the naked turf. Thab and the other warriors who
had escorted me remained outside. Above us brooded old Khossuth on a carven
stone elevated above the first tier, and covered with leopard-skins.</p>

<p>I glanced beyond him to that dusky star-filled sky whose strange beauty
never failed to fascinate me, and I laughed at the fantasy of it
all&mdash;where I, Esau Cairn, was to earn by sweat and blood my right to
exist on this alien world, the existence of which was undreamed by the people
of my own planet.</p>

<p>I saw a group of warriors approaching from the other side, a giant form
looming among them. Ghor the Bear glared at me across the ring, his hairy
paws grasping the thongs, then with a roar he vaulted over them and stood
before me, an image of truculence incarnate&mdash;angry because I had chanced
to reach the ring before him.</p>

<p>On his rude throne above us, old Khossuth lifted a spear and cast it
earthward. Our eyes followed its flight, and as it sheathed its shining blade
in the turf outside the ring, we hurled ourselves at each other, iron masses
of bone and thew, vibrant with fierce life and the lust to destroy.</p>

<p>We were each naked except for a sort of leather loin-clout, which was more
brace than garment. The rules of the match were simple, we were not to strike
with our fists or open hands, knees or elbows, kick, bite or gouge. Outside
of that, anything went.</p>

<p>At the first impact of his hairy body against mine, I realized that Ghor
was stronger than Logar. Without my best natural weapons&mdash;my
fists&mdash;Ghor had the advantage.</p>

<p>He was a hairy mountain of iron muscle, and he moved with the quickness of
a huge cat. Accustomed to such fighting, he knew tricks of which I was
ignorant. Lastly, his bullet head was set so squarely on his shoulders that
it was practically impossible to strangle that thick squat neck of his.</p>

<p>What saved me was the wild life I had lived which had toughened me as no
man, living as a man, can be toughened. Mine was the superior quickness, and
ultimately, the superior endurance.</p>

<p>There is little to be said of that fight. Time ceased to be composed of
intervals of change, and merged into a blind mist of tearing, snarling
eternity. There was no sound except our panting gasps, the guttering of the
torches in the light wind, and the impact of our feet on the turf, of our
hard bodies against each other. We were too evenly matched for either to gain
a quick advantage. There was no pinning of shoulders, as in an Earthly
wrestling match. The fight would continue until one or both of the
contestants were dead or senseless.</p>

<p>When I think of our endurance and stamina, I stand appalled. At midnight
we were still rending and tearing at each other. The whole world was swimming
red when I broke free out of a murderous grapple. My whole frame was a throb
of wrenched, twisted agony. Some of my muscles were numbed and useless. Blood
poured from my nose and mouth. I was half blind and dizzy from the impact of
my head against the hard earth. My legs trembled and my breath came in great
gulps. But I saw that Ghor was in no better case. He too bled at the nose and
mouth, and more, blood trickled from his ears. He reeled as he faced me, and
his hairy chest heaved spasmodically. He spat out a mouthful of blood, and
with a roar that was more a gasp, he hurled himself at me again. And steeling
my ebbing strength for one last effort, I caught his outstretched wrist,
wheeled, ducking low and bringing his arm over my shoulder, and heaved with
all my last ounce of power.</p>

<p><br>The impetus of his rush helped my throw. He whirled headlong over my back
and crashed to the turf on his neck and shoulder, slumped over and lay still.
An instant I stood swaying above him, while a sudden deep-throated roar rose
from the people of Koth, and then a rush of darkness blotted out the stars
and the flickering torches, and I fell senseless across the still body of my
antagonist.</p>

<p>Later they told me that they thought both Ghor and I were dead. They
worked over us for hours. How our hearts resisted the terrible strain of our
exertions is a matter of wonder to me. Men said it was by far the longest
fight ever waged in the arena.</p>

<p>Ghor was badly hurt, even for a Kothan. That last fall had broken his
shoulder bone and fractured his skull, to say nothing of the minor injuries
he had received before the climax. Three of my ribs were broken, and my
joints, limbs and muscles so twisted and wrenched that for days I was unable
even to rise from my couch. The men of Koth treated our wounds and bruises
with all their skill, which far transcends that of the Earth; but in the main
it was our remarkable primitive vitality that put us back on our feet. When a
creature of the wild is wounded, he generally either dies quickly or recovers
quickly.</p>

<p>I asked Thab if Ghor would hate me for his defeat, and Thab was at a loss;
Ghor had never been defeated before.</p>

<p>But my mind was soon put to rest on this score. Seven brawny warriors
entered the chamber in which I had been placed, bearing a litter on which lay
my late foe, wrapped in so many bandages he was scarcely recognizable. But
his bellowing voice was familiar. He had forced his friends to bring him to
see me as soon as he was able to stir on his couch. He held no malice. In his
great, simple, primitive heart there was only admiration for the man who had
given him his first defeat. He recounted our Homeric struggle with a gusto
that made the roof reverberate, and roared his impatient eagerness for us to
fare forth and do battle together against the foes of Koth.</p>

<p>He was borne back to his own chamber, still bellowing his admiration and
gory plans for the future, and I experienced a warm glow in my heart for this
great-hearted child of nature, who was far more of a man than many
sophisticated scions of civilization that I had met.</p>

<p>And so I, Esau Cairn, took the step from savagery to barbarism. In the
vast domed council hall before the assembled tribesmen, as soon as I was
able, I stood before the throne of Khossuth Skullsplitter, and he cut the
mysterious symbol of Koth above my head with his sword. Then with his own
hands he buckled on me the harness of a warrior&mdash;the broad leather belt
with the iron buckle, supporting my poniard and a long straight sword with a
broad silver guard. Then the warriors filed past me, and each chief placed
his palm against mine, and spoke his name, and I repeated it, and he repeated
the name they had given me: Ironhand. That part was most wearisome for there
were some four thousand warriors, and four hundred of these were chiefs of
various rank. But it was part of the ritual of initiation, and when it was
over I was as much a Kothan as if I had been born into the tribe.</p>

<p>In the tower chamber, pacing like a caged tiger while Thab talked, and
later as a member of the tribe, I learned all that the people of Koth knew of
their strange planet.</p>

<p>They and their kind, they said, were the only true humans on Almuric,
though there was a mysterious race of beings dwelling far to the south called
Yagas. The Kothans called themselves Guras, which applied to all cast in
their mold, and meant no more than "man" does on Earth. There
were many tribes of Guras, each dwelling in its separate city, each of which
was a counterpart of Koth. No tribe numbered more than four or five thousand
fighting-men, with the appropriate number of women and children.</p>

<p>No man of Koth had ever circled the globe, but they ranged far in their
hunts and raids, and legends had been handed down concerning their
world&mdash;which, naturally, they called by a name simply corresponding to
the word "Earth"; though after a while some of them took up my
habit of speaking of the planet as Almuric. Far to the north there was a land
of ice and snow, uninhabited by human beings, though men spoke of weird cries
shuddering by night from the ice crags, and of shadows falling across the
snow. A lesser distance to the south rose a barrier no man had ever
passed&mdash;a gigantic wall of rock which legend said girdled the planet; it
was called, therefore, the Girdle. What lay beyond that Girdle, none knew.
Some believed it was the rim of the world, and beyond it lay only empty
space. Others maintained that another hemisphere lay beyond it. They
believed, as seemed to me most logical, that the Girdle separated the
northern and southern halves of the world, and that the southern hemisphere
was inhabited by men and animals, though the exponents of their theory could
give no proof, and were generally scoffed at as over-imaginative
romanticists.</p>

<p>At any rate, the cities of the Guras dotted the vast expanse that lay
between the Girdle and the land of ice. The northern hemisphere possessed no
great body of water. There were rivers, great plains, a few scattered lakes,
occasional stretches of dark, thick forests, long ranges of barren hills, and
a few mountains. The larger rivers ran southward, to plunge into chasms in
the Girdle.</p>

<p>The cities of the Guras were invariably built on the open plains, and
always far apart. Their architecture was the result of the peculiar evolution
of their builders&mdash;they were, basically, fortresses of rocks heaped up
for defense. They reflected the nature of their builders, being rude,
stalwart, massive, despising gaudy show and ornamentation, and knowing
nothing of the arts.</p>

<p>In many ways the Guras are like the men of Earth, in other ways bafflingly
different. Some of the lines on which they have evolved are so alien to
Earthly evolution that I find it difficult to explain their ways and their
development.</p>

<p>Specifically, Koth&mdash;and what is said of Koth can be said of every
other Gura city:&mdash;the men of Koth are, skilled in war, the hunt, and
weapon-making. The latter science is taught to each male child, but now
seldom used. It is seldom found necessary to manufacture new arms, because of
the durability of the material used. Weapons are handed down from generation
to generation, or captured from enemies.</p>

<p>Metal is used only for weapons, in building, and for clasps and buckles on
garments. No ornaments are worn, either by men or women, and there are no
such things as coins. There is no medium of exchange. No trade between cities
exists, and such "business" as goes on within the city is a
matter of barter. The only cloth worn is a kind of silk, made from the fiber
of a curious plant grown within the city walls. Other plants furnish wine,
fruit, and seasonings. Fresh meat, the principal food of the Guras, is
furnished by hunting, a pastime at once a sport and an occupation.</p>

<p>The folk of Koth, then, are highly skilled in metal-working, in
silk-weaving, and in their peculiar form of agriculture. They have a written
language, a simple hieroglyphic form, scrawled on leaves like papyrus, with a
daggerlike pen dipped in the crimson juice of a curious blossom, but few
except the chiefs can read or write. Literature they have none; they know
nothing of painting, sculpturing, or the "higher" learning. They
have evolved to the point of culture needful for the necessities of life, and
they progress no further. Seemingly defying laws we on Earth have come to
regard as immutable, they remain stationary, neither advancing nor
retrogressing.</p>

<p>Like most barbaric people, they have a form of rude poetry, dealing almost
exclusively with battle, mayhem and rapine. They have no bards or minstrels,
but every man of the tribe knows the popular ballads of his clan, and after a
few jacks of ale is prone to bellow them forth in a voice fit to burst
one's eardrums.</p>

<p>These songs are never written down, and there is no written history. As a
result, events of antiquity are hazy, and mixed with improbable legends.</p>

<p>No one knows how old is the city of Koth. Its gigantic stones are
impervious to the elements, and might have stood there ten years or ten
thousand years. I am of the opinion that the city is at least fifteen
thousand years old. The Guras are an ancient race, in spite of their
exuberant barbarism which gives them the atmosphere of a new young people. Of
the evolution of the race from whatever beast was their common ancestor, of
their racial splittings off and tribal drifts, of their development to their
present condition, nothing whatever is known. The Guras themselves have no
idea of evolution. They suppose that, like eternity, their race is without
beginning and without end, that they have always been exactly as they are
now. They have no legends to explain their creation.</p>

<p><br>I have devoted most of my remarks to the men of Koth. The women of Koth
are no less worthy of detailed comment. I found the difference in the
appearance of the sexes not so inexplicable after all. It is simply the
result of natural evolution, and its roots lie in a fierce tenderness on the
part of the Gura males for their women. It was to protect their women that
they first, I am certain, built those brutish heaps of stone and dwelt among
them; for the innate nature of the Gura male is definitely nomadic.</p>

<p>The woman, carefully guarded and shielded both from danger and from the
hard work that is the natural portion of the women of Earthly barbarians,
evolved by natural process into the type I have described. The men, on the
other hand, lead incredibly active and strenuous lives. Their existence has
been a savage battle for survival, ever since the first ape stood upright on
Almuric. And they have evolved into a special type to fit their needs. Their
peculiar appearance is not a result of degeneration or underdevelopment. They
are, indeed, a highly specialized type, finely adapted to the wild life they
follow.</p>

<p>As the men assume all risks and responsibility, they naturally assume all
authority. The Gura woman has no say whatever in the government of the city
and tribe, and her mate's authority over her is absolute, with the
exception that she has the right to appeal to the council and chief in case
of oppression. Her scope is narrow; few women ever set foot outside the city
in which they are born, unless they are carried off in a raid.</p>

<p>Yet her lot is not so unhappy as it might seem. I have said that one of
the characteristics of the Gura male is a savage tenderness for his women.
Mistreatment of a woman is very rare, not tolerated by the tribe.</p>

<p>Monogamy is the rule. The Guras are not given to hand-kissing and pretty
compliments, and the other superficial adjuncts of chivalry, but there is
justice and a rough kindness in their dealing with women, somewhat similar to
the attitude of the American frontiersman.</p>

<p>The duties of the Gura women are few, concerned mainly with child-bearing
and child-rearing. They do no work heavier than the manufacturing of silk
from the silk plants. They are musically inclined, and play on a small,
stringed affair, resembling a lute, and they sing. They are quicker-witted,
and of much more sensitive mind than the men. They are witty, merry,
affectionate, playful and docile. They have their own amusements, and time
does not seem to drag for them. The average woman could not be persuaded to
set foot outside the city walls. They well know the perils that hem the
cities in, and they are content in the protection of their ferocious mates
and masters.</p>

<p>The men are, as I have said, in many ways like barbaric peoples on Earth.
In some respects they resemble, I imagine, the ancient Vikings. They are
honest, scorning theft and deceit. They delight in war and the hunt, but are
not wantonly cruel, except when maddened by rage or bloodlust. Then they can
be screaming fiends. They are blunt in speech, rough in their manners, easily
angered, but as easily pacified, except when confronted by an hereditary
enemy. They have a definite, though crude, sense of humor, a ferocious love
for tribe and city, and a passion for personal freedom.</p>

<p>Their weapons consist of swords, daggers, spears, and a firearm something
like a carbine&mdash;a single-shot, breech-loading weapon of no great range.
The combustible material is not powder, as we know it. Its counterpart is not
found on Earth. It possesses both percussion and explosive qualities. The
bullet is of a substance much like lead. These weapons were used mainly in
war with men; for hunting, bows and arrows were most often used.</p>

<p>Hunting parties are always going forth, so that the full force of warriors
is seldom in the city at once. Hunters are often gone for weeks or months.
But there are always a thousand fighting men in the city to repel possible
attack, though it is not often that the Guras lay siege to a hostile city.
Those cities are difficult to storm, and it is impossible to starve out the
inhabitants, since they produce so much of their food supply within the
walls, and in each city is an unfailing spring of pure water. The hunters
frequently sought their prey in the hills which I had haunted, and which were
reputed to contain more and varied forms of ferocious bestial life than any
other section of the globe. The boldest hunters went in strong parties to the
ills, and seldom roamed there more than a few days. The fact that I had lived
among the hills alone for months won me even more respect and admiration
among those wild fighting men than had my fight with Ghor.</p>

<p>Oh, I learned much of Almuric. As this is a chronicle and not an essay, I
can scarcely skim the surface of customs, ways and traditions. I learned all
they could tell me, and I learned much more. The Guras were not first on
Almuric, though they considered themselves to be. They told me of ancient
ruins, never built by Guras, relics of vanished races, who, they supposed,
were contemporary with their distant ancestors, but which, as I came to
learn, had risen and vanished awfully before the first Gura began to heap up
stones to build his primordial city. And how I learned what no Gura knew is
part of this strange narrative.</p>

<p>But they spoke of strange unhuman beings or survivals. They told me of the
Yagas, a terrible race of winged black men, dwelling far to the south, within
sight of the Girdle, in the grim city of Yugga, on the rock Yuthla, by the
River Yogh, in the land of Yagg, where living man had never set foot. The
Yagas, the Guras said, were not true men, but devils in a human form. From
Yugga they swooped periodically, bearing the sword of slaughter and the torch
of destruction, to carry young Gura girls into a slavery the manner of which
none knew, because none had ever escaped from the land of Yagg. Some men
thought that they were fed to a monster worshiped by the Yagas as a god,
though some swore that the fiends worshiped nothing except themselves. This
was known: their ruler was a black queen, named Yasmeena, and for more than a
thousand years she had reigned on the grim rock of Yuthla, her shadow falling
across the world to make men shudder.</p>

<p>The Guras told me other things, things weird and terrible: of dog-headed
monstrosities skulking beneath the ruins of nameless cities; of earth-shaking
colossals stalking through the night; of fires flitting like flaming bats
through the shadowy skies; of things that haunted midnight forests, crawling,
squamous things that were never seen, but which tracked men down in the dank
depths. They told me of great bats whose laughter drove men mad, and of gaunt
shapes shambling hideously through the dusk of the hills. They told me of
such things as do not even haunt the dreams of men on my native planet. For
Life has taken strange shapes on Almuric, and natural Life is not the only
Life there.</p>

<p>But the nightmares told to me and the nightmares seen by me unfold in
their place, and I have already lingered too long in my narrative. Be patient
a little, because events move swiftly on Almuric, and my chronicle moves no
less swiftly when well under way.</p>

<p>For months I dwelt in Koth, fitting into the life of hunting, feasting,
ale-guzzling, and brawling, as if I had been born into it. There life was not
restrained and bound down, as it is on Earth. As yet no tribal war had tested
my powers, but there was fighting enough in the city with naked hands, in
friendly bouts, and drunken brawls, when the fighting-men dashed down their
foaming jacks and bellowed their challenges across the ale-stained boards. I
revelled in my new existence. Here, as in the hills, I threw my full powers
unleashed into life; and here, unlike as in the hills, I had human
companionship, of a sort that suited my particular make-up. I felt no need of
art, literature or intellectuality; I hunted, I gorged, I guzzled, I fought;
I spread my massive arms and clutched at life like a glutton. And in my
brawling and revelling I all but forgot the slender figure which had sat so
patiently in the council chamber beneath the great dome.</p>
<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="almuric5"
name="almuric5">CHAPTER 5</a></h2>

<p class="first">I HAD WANDERED FAR in my hunting. Alone I had spent several
nights on the plains. Now I was returning leisurely, but I was still many
miles from Koth, whose massive towers I could not yet glimpse across the
waving savannas. I cannot say what my thoughts were as I swung along, my
carbine in the crook of my arm, but they were likely concerned with spoors in
the water's edge, crushed-down grass marking the passing of some large
animal, or the scents borne on the light wind.</p>

<p>Whatever my thoughts may have been, they were interrupted by a shrill cry.
Wheeling, I saw a slim white figure racing across the grassy level toward me.
Behind her, gaining with every stride, came one of those giant carnivorous
birds which are among the most dangerous of all the grisly denizens of the
grasslands. They tower ten feet in height and somewhat resemble an ostrich
except for the beak, which is a huge curving weapon, three feet in length,
pointed and edged like a scimitar. A stroke of that beak can slash a man
asunder, and the great taloned feet of the monster can tear a human limb from
limb.</p>

<p>This mountain of destruction was hurtling along behind the flying girl at
appalling speed, and I knew it would overtake her long before I could hope to
reach them. Cursing the necessity for depending on my none too accurate
marksmanship, I lifted my carbine and took as steady an aim as possible. The
girl was directly in line with the brute, and I could not risk a shot at the
huge body, lest I hit her instead. I had to chance a shot at the great head
that bobbed bafflingly on the long arching neck.</p>

<p>It was more luck than skill that sent my bullet home. At the crack of the
shot the giant head jerked backward as if the monster had run into an unseen
wall. The stumpy wings thrashed thunderously, and staggering erratically, the
brute pitched to the earth.</p>

<p>The girl fell at the same instant, as if the same bullet had brought them
both down. Running forward to bend over her, I was surprised to see Altha,
daughter of Zal, looking up at me with her dark enigmatic eyes. Quickly
satisfying myself that she was not injured, outside of fright and exhaustion,
I turned to the thunderbird and found it quite dead, its few brains oozing
out of a hole in its narrow skull.</p>

<p>Turning back to Altha, I scowled down at her.</p>

<p>"What are you doing outside the city?" I demanded. "Are
you quite mad, to venture so far into the wilderness alone?"</p>

<p>She made no reply, but I sensed a hurt in her dark eyes, and I repented
the roughness of my speech. I dropped down on one knee beside her.</p>

<p>"You are a strange girl, Altha," I said. "You are not
like the other women of Koth. Folk say you are wilful and rebellious, without
reason. I do not understand you. Why should you risk your life like
this?"</p>

<p>"What will you do now?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Why, take you back to the city, of course."</p>

<p>Her eyes smoldered with a curious sullenness.</p>

<p>"You will take me back, and my father will whip me. But I will run
away again&mdash;and again&mdash;and again!"</p>

<p>"But why should you run away?" I asked in bewilderment.
"There is nowhere for you to go. Some beast will devour you."</p>

<p>"So!" she answered. "Perhaps it is my wish to be
devoured."</p>

<p>"Then why did you run from the thunderbird?"</p>

<p>"The instinct to live is hard to conquer," she admitted.</p>

<p>"But why should you wish to die?" I expostulated. "The
women of Koth are happy, and you have as much as any."</p>

<p>She looked away from me, out across the broad plains.</p>

<p>"To eat, drink and sleep is not all," she answered in a
strange voice. "The beasts do that."</p>

<p>I ran my fingers through my thick hair in perplexity. I had heard similar
sentiments voiced in many different ways on Earth, but it was the first time
I had ever heard them from the lips of an inhabitant on Almuric. Altha
continued in a low detached voice, almost as if she were speaking to herself
rather than to me:</p>

<p>"Life is too hard for me. I do not fit, somehow, as the others do. I
bruise myself on its rough edges. I look for something that is not and never
was."</p>

<p>Uneasy at her strange words, I caught her heavy locks in my hands and
forced back her head to look into her face. Her enigmatic eyes met mine with
a strange glimmer in them such as I had never seen.</p>

<p>"It was hard before you came," she said. "It is harder
now."</p>

<p>Startled, I released her, and she turned her head away.</p>

<p>"Why should I make it harder?" I asked bewilderedly.</p>

<p>"What constitutes life?" she countered. "Is the life we
live all there is? Is there nothing outside and beyond our material
aspirations?"</p>

<p>I scratched my head in added perplexity.</p>

<p>"Why," I said, "on Earth I met many people who were
always following some nebulous dream or ideal, but I never observed that they
were happy. On my planet there is much grasping and groping for unseen
things, but I never knew there was such full content as I have known on
Almuric."</p>

<p>"I thought you different," she said, still looking away from
me. "When I saw you lying wounded and in chains, with your smooth skin
and strange eyes, I thought you were more gentle than other men. But you are
as rough and fierce as the rest. You spend your days and nights in slaying
beasts, fighting men, and in riotous wassail."</p>

<p>"But they all do," I protested.</p>

<p>She nodded. "And so I do not fit in life, and were better
dead."</p>

<p><br>I felt unreasonably ashamed. It had occurred to me that an Earthwoman
would find life on Almuric intolerably crude and narrow, but it seemed beyond
reason that a native woman would have such feelings. If the other women I had
seen desired more superficial gentleness on the part of their men, they had
not made it known. They seemed content with shelter and protection, and
cheerfully resigned to the rough manners of the males. I sought for words but
found none, unskilled as I was in polite discourse. I suddenly felt my
roughness, crudity and raw barbarism, and stood abashed.</p>

<p>"I'll take you back to Koth," I said helplessly.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shapely shoulders. "And you can watch my father
whip me, if you will."</p>

<p>At that I found my tongue.</p>

<p>"He won't whip you," I retorted angrily. "Let him
lay a hand on you, and I'll break his back."</p>

<p>She looked up at me quickly, with eyes widened in sudden interest. My arm
had found its way about her slim form, and I was glaring into her eyes, with
my face very close to hers. Her lips parted, and had that breathless instant
lasted a little longer, I know not what would have happened. But suddenly the
color went from her face, and from her parted lips rang a terrible scream.
Her gaze was fixed on something beyond and above me, and the thrash of wings
suddenly filled the air.</p>

<p>I wheeled on one knee, to see the air above me thronged with dark shapes.
The Yagas! The winged men of Almuric! I had half believed them a myth; yet
here they were in all their mysterious terror.</p>

<p>I had but a glance as I reared up, clubbing my empty carbine. I saw that
they were tall and rangy in build, sinewy and powerful, with ebon skins. They
seemed made like ordinary men, except for the great leathery batlike wings
which grew from their shoulders. They were naked except for loincloths, and
were armed with short curved blades.</p>

<p>I rose on my toes as the first swooped in, scimitar lifted, and met him
with a swing of my carbine that broke off the stock and crushed his narrow
skull like an eggshell. The next instant they were whirling and thrashing
about me, their curved blades licking at me like jets of lightning from all
sides, the very number of their broad wings hampering them.</p>

<p>Whirling the carbine barrel in a wheel about me, I broke and beat back the
flickering blades, and in a furious exchange of strokes, caught another a
glancing blow on the head that stretched him senseless at my feet. Then a
wild despairing cry rang out behind me, and abruptly the rush slackened.</p>

<p>The whole pack was in the air, racing southward, and I stood frozen. In
the arms of one of them writhed and shrieked a slender white figure,
stretching out imploring arms to me. Altha! They had snatched her up from
behind my back, and were carrying her away to whatever doom awaited her in
that black citadel of mystery far to the south. The terrific velocity with
which the Yagas raced through the sky was already taking them out of my
sight.</p>

<p>As I stood there baffled, I felt a movement at my feet. Looking down I saw
one of my victims sit up and feel his head dazedly. I vengefully lifted my
carbine barrel to dash out his brains; then a sudden thought struck me,
inspired by the ease with which Altha's captor had carried both his
weight and hers in the air.</p>

<p>Drawing my poniard, I dragged my captive to his feet. Standing erect he
was taller than I, with shoulders equally broad, though his limbs were lean
and wiry rather than massive. His dark eyes, which slanted slightly, regarded
me with the unblinking stare of a venomous serpent.</p>

<p>The Guras had told me the Yagas spoke a tongue similar to their own.</p>

<p>"You are going to carry me through the air in pursuit of your
companions," I said.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and spoke in a peculiarly harsh voice.</p>

<p>"I cannot carry your weight."</p>

<p>"Then that's too bad for you," I answered grimly, and
whirling him about, I leaped upon his back, locking my legs about his waist.
My left arm was hooked about his neck, the poniard in my right hand pricked
his side. He had kept his feet under the impact of my bulk, spreading his
great wings.</p>

<p>"Take the air!" I snarled in his ear, sinking the dagger point
into his flesh. "Fly, damn you, or I'll cut your heart
out!"</p>

<p>His wings began to thrash the air, and we rose slowly from the earth. It
was a most sensational experience, but one to which I gave scant thought at
the time, being so engrossed in my fury at the abduction of Altha.</p>

<p><br>When we had risen to a height of about a thousand feet, I looked for the
abductors, and saw them far away, a mere group of black dots in the southern
sky. After them I steered my reluctant steed.</p>

<p>In spite of my threats and urging for greater speed the flying dots soon
vanished. Still I kept on due southward, feeling that even if I failed to
overtake them, I would eventually come to the great dusky rock where legend
placed their habitation.</p>

<p>Inspired by my poniard, my bearer made good time, considering the burden
he was carrying. For hours we sped over the savannas, and by the middle of
the afternoon, the landscape changed. We were flying over a forest, the first
I had seen on Almuric. The trees seemed to tower to a vast height.</p>

<p>It was near sundown when I saw the farther limits of the forest, and in
the grasslands beyond, the ruins of a city. From among these ruins smoke
curled upward, and I asked my steed if his companions were cooking their
evening meal there. His only answer was a snarl.</p>

<p>We were flying low over the forest, when a sudden uproar caused me to look
down. We were just passing over a narrow glade, and in it a terrific battle
was taking place. A pack of hyenas had attacked a giant unicornlike beast, as
big as a bison. Half a dozen mangled, trampled bodies attested the fury of
the beast's defense, and even as I peered down, he caught the single
survivor on his swordlike ivory horn, and cast it a score of feet in the air,
broken and torn.</p>

<p>In the brief fascination of the sight, I must have involuntarily loosened
my grasp on my captive. For at that instant, with a convulsive bucking heave
and twist, he wrenched free and hurled me sideways. Caught off guard, I
clutched vainly at empty air, and rushing earthward, crashed with a stunning
impact on the loamy leaf-carpeted earth, directly in front of the maddened
unicorn!</p>

<p>I had a dazed brief glimpse of his mountainous bulk looming over me, as
his massive lowered head drove his horn at my breast. Then I lurched up on
one knee, simultaneously grasping that ivory sword with my left hand and
seeking to deflect it, while my right hand drove my poniard up toward the
great jugular. Then there came a terrific impact against my skull, and
consciousness was blotted out in darkness.</p>
<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="almuric6"
name="almuric6">CHAPTER 6</a></h2>

<p class="first">I COULD HAVE BEEN senseless only a few minutes. When I
regained consciousness my first sensation was that of a crushing weight upon
my limbs and body. Struggling weakly, I found that I was lying beneath the
lifeless body of a unicorn. At the instant my poniard had torn open his great
jugular vein, the base of his horn must have struck my head, while the vast
body collapsed upon me. Only the soft spongy ground beneath me had saved me
from being crushed to a pulp. Working myself out from under that bulk was a
herculean task, but eventually I accomplished it, and stood up, bruised and
breathless, with the half-dried blood of the monster clotted in my hair and
smearing my limbs. I was a grisly sight to look at, but I wasted no time on
my appearance. My erstwhile steed was nowhere in evidence, and the circling
trees limited my view of the sky.</p>

<p>Selecting the tallest of these trees, I climbed it as swiftly as possible,
and on the topmost branches, looked out over the forest. The sun was setting.
I saw that perhaps an hour's swift walk to the south, the forest
thinned out and ceased. Smoke still drifted thinly up from the deserted city.
And I saw my former captive just dropping down among the ruins. He must have
lingered, after he had overthrown me, possibly to see if I showed any signs
of life, probably to rest his wings after that long grind.</p>

<p>I cursed; there went my chance of stealing up on them unsuspected. Then I
got a surprise. No sooner had the Yaga vanished than he reappeared, shooting
up out of the city like a rocket. Without hesitation he raced off southward,
speeding through the sky at a rate that left me gaping. What was the reason
for his flight? If it had been his companions who were among the ruins, why
had he not alighted? Perhaps he had found them gone, and was merely following
them. Yet his actions seemed strange, considering the leisurely way he had
approached the ruins. His flight had the earmarks of panic.</p>

<p>Shaking my head in puzzlement, I descended the tree and set out for the
ruins as swiftly as I could make my way through the dense growth, paying no
heed to the rustling in the leaves about me, and the muttering of rousing
life, that grew as the shadows deepened.</p>

<p>Night had fallen when I emerged from the forest, but the moon was rising,
casting a weird unreal glow over the plains. The ruins glimmered ghostily in
the near distance. The walls were not of the rough greenish material used by
the Guras. As I approached I saw they were of marble, and that fact caused a
vague uneasiness to stir in my mind. I remembered legends told by the Kothans
of ruined marble cities haunted by ghoulish beings. Such ruins were found in
certain uninhabited places, and none knew their origin.</p>

<p>A brooding silence lay over the broken walls and columns as I entered the
ruins. Between the gleaming white tusks and surfaces deep black shadow
floated, almost liquid in its quality. From one dusky pool to the other I
glided silently, sword in hand, expecting anything from an ambush by the
Yagas to an attack by some lurking beast of prey. Utter silence reigned, as I
had never encountered it anywhere on Almuric before. Not a distant lion
roared, not a night fowl voiced its weird cry. I might have been the last
survivor on a dead world.</p>

<p>In silence I came to a great open space, flanked by a circle of broken
pillars, which must have been a plaza. Here I halted, motionless, my skin
crawling.</p>

<p>In the midst of the plaza smoldered the dying coals of a fire over which,
on spits planted in the earth, were roasting pieces of meat. The Yagas had
evidently built that fire and&mdash;prepared to sup; but they had not eaten
of their meal. They lay strewn about the plaza in a way to appall the
hardiest.</p>

<p>I had never gazed on such a scene of organic devastation. Hands, feet,
grinning heads, bits of flesh, entrails, clots of blood littered the whole
plaza. The heads were like balls of blackness, rolled out of the shadows
against the snowy marble; their teeth grinned, their eyes glimmered palely in
the moonlight. <i>Something</i> had come upon the winged men as they sat
about their fire and had torn them limb from limb. On the remnants of flesh
were the marks of fangs, and some of the bones had been broken, apparently to
get the marrow.</p>

<p>A cold ripple went up and down my spine. What animal but man breaks bones
in that fashion? But the scattering of the bloody remnants seemed not the
work of beasts; it seemed too vindictive, as if it were the work of
vengeance, fury or bestial blood-thirstiness.</p>

<p>Where, then, was Altha? Her remains were not among those of her captors.
Glancing at the flesh on the spit, the configuration of the pieces set me to
shuddering. Shaken with horror, I saw that my dark suspicions were correct.
It was parts of a human body the accursed Yagas had been roasting for their
meal. Sick with revulsion and dread, I examined the pitiful remnants more
closely, and breathed a deep sigh of relief to see the thick muscular limbs
of a man, and not the slender parts of a woman. But after that I looked
unmoved at the torn bloody bits that had been Yagas.</p>

<p>But where was the girl? Had she escaped the slaughter and hidden herself,
or had she been taken by the slayers? Looking about at the towers and fallen
blocks and pillars, bathed in the weird moonlight, I was aware of a distinct
aura of evil, of lurking menace. I felt the glare of hidden eyes.</p>

<p>But I began casting about the plaza, and came upon a trail of blood drops,
lying blackly in the moon, leading through a maze of drunken pillars, and for
want of better occupation, I followed it. At least it might lead me to the
slayers of the winged men.</p>

<p>I passed under the shadows of leaning pillars which dwarfed my human frame
with their brute massiveness, and came into a crumbling edifice, overgrown
with lichen. Through the broken roof and the gaping windows the moon poured a
fungus-white light that served to make the shadows blacker. But a square of
moonlight fell across the entrance of a corridor, and leading into it, I saw
the sprinkle of dark clotted drops on the cracked vine-grown marble. Into the
corridor I groped, and almost broke my neck on the stairs that lay within.
Down them I went, and striking a level, hesitated and was about to retrace my
steps when I was electrified by a sound that stopped my heart, and then sent
the blood pounding madly through my veins. Through the darkness, faint and
far away, sounded the call: "Esau! Esau Cairn!"</p>

<p>Altha! Who else could it be? Why should an icy shuddering pass over me,
and the short hairs bristle at the back of my neck? I started to answer; then
caution clutched my tongue. She could not know I was within hearing, surely.
Perhaps she was calling as a frightened child will cry for someone far out of
hearing. I went as swiftly down the black tunnel as I dared, in the direction
I had heard the cry. And was gagged by a tendency toward nausea.</p>

<p>My groping hand encountered a doorway and I halted, sensing, as a wild
thing does; a living presence of some sort near me. Straining my eyes in the
pitch dark, I spoke Altha's name in a low urgent voice. Instantly two
lights burned in the darkness, yellowish glows at which I stared for an
instant before I realized that they were two eyes. They were broad as my
hand, round and of a scintillance I cannot describe. Behind them I got a
vague impression of a huge shapeless bulk. Simultaneously such a wave of
instinctive fear swept over me, that I withdrew quickly into the tunnel and
hastened along it in the direction I had been going. Back in the cell I heard
a faint movement, like the shifting of some great pulpy mass, mingled with a
soft rasping sound, as of bristles scraping against stone.</p>

<p>A few score paces more and I halted. The tunnel seemed endless, and
besides, judging from the feel, other tunnels branched off from it in the
darkness, and I had no way of knowing which was the right one. As I stood
there I again heard the call: "Esau! Esau Cairn!"</p>

<p><br>Steeling myself against something, I knew not what, I set off once more in
the direction of the ghostly voice. How far I went I do not know, until I
stopped once more baffled. Then from nearby the voice rang out again:
"Esau! Esau Cairn!" It rose to a high-pitched note, trailing off
into an awful burst of inhuman laughter that froze the blood in my veins.</p>

<p>That was not Altha's voice. I had known all the time that it was
not&mdash;that it could not be. Yet the alternative was so inexplicable that
I had refused to heed what my intuition affirmed and my reason denied.</p>

<p>Now from every direction, on every hand rose a medley of shrill demoniac
voices, all shrieking my name with the mockery of devils. The tunnels that
had been so silent now rang and re-echoed with strident clamor. I stood
bewildered and terrified, as the damned must stand in the clamorous halls of
hell. I passed through the stages of icy terror, bewildered horror,
desperation, berserk fury. With a maddened roar I plunged blindly at the
sounds that seemed nearest, only to collide with a solid wall, while a
thousand inhuman voices rose in hideous mirth. Wheeling like a wounded bull,
I charged again, this time into the mouth of another tunnel. Racing down
this, mad to come to grips with my tormenters, I burst into a vast shadowy
space, into which a beam of moonlight cast a ghostly shaft. And again I heard
my name called, but in human tones of fear and anguish:</p>

<p>"Esau! Oh, Esau!"</p>

<p>Even as I answered the piteous cry with a savage bellow, I saw her. Altha,
etched in the dim moonlight. She was stretched out on the floor, her hands
and feet in the shadow. But I saw that at each outstretched member squatted a
dim misshapen figure.</p>

<p>With a blood-thirsty yell I charged, and the darkness sprang into nauseous
life, flooding my knees with tangible shapes. Sharp fangs gashed me, apish
hands clawed at me. They could not halt me. Swinging my sword in great arcs
that cut a path through solid masses of writhing shapes, I forged toward the
girl that twisted and screamed on the floor in that square of moonlight.</p>

<p>I waded through a rolling, surging mire of squirming biting things that
washed about me waist-high, but they could not drag me down. I reached the
moonlit square, and the creatures that held Altha gave back before the
whistling menace of my sword edge, and the girl sprang up and clung to me.
Even as the shadowy horde rolled in to drag us down I saw a crumbling stair
leading up, and I thrust her upon it, wheeling to cover her retreat.</p>

<p>It was dark on the stairs, though they led up into a chamber flooded with
light through a broken roof. That battle was fought in utter darkness, with
only my senses of feeling and hearing to guide my strokes. And it was fought
in silence, too, except for my panting, and the whir and crunch of my
blade.</p>

<p><br>Up that drunken stair I backed, battling every inch of the way, the skin
between my shoulders crawling with the expectancy of an attack from the rear.
If they had come upon us from above, we had been lost, but evidently all were
below me. What manner of creatures I was fighting I did not know, except that
they were taloned and fanged. Otherwise, from the feel of them, they were
stunted and misshapen, furry and apish.</p>

<p>When I came out into the chamber above the tunnels I could see little
more. The moonlight streaming through the broken roof made only a white shaft
in the darkness. I could only make out vague forms in the dimness about
me&mdash;a heaving, writhing and lashing of shadows, that surged up against
me, clawing and tearing, and fell back beneath my lashing sword.</p>

<p>Thrusting Altha behind me, I backed across that shadowy chamber toward a
wide rift that showed in the crumbling wall, reeling and stumbling in the
whirlpool of battle that swirled and eddied about me. As I reached the rift
through which Altha had already slipped, there was a concerted rush to drag
me down. Panic swept over me at the thought of being pulled down in that
shadowy room by that dim horde. A blasting burst of fury, a gasping,
straining plunge, and I catapulted through the rift, carrying half a dozen
attackers with me.</p>

<p>Reeling up, I shook the clinging horrors from my shoulders as a bear might
shake off wolves, and bracing my feet slashed right and left. Now for the
first time I saw the nature of my foes.</p>

<p>The bodies were like those of deformed apes, covered with sparse dirty
white fur. Their heads were doglike, with small close-set ears. But their
eyes were those of serpents&mdash;the same venomous steady lidless stare.</p>

<p>Of all the forms of life I had encountered on that strange planet, none
filled me with as much loathing as these dwarfish monstrosities. I backed
away from the mangled heap on the earth, as a nauseous flood poured through
the rift in the wall.</p>

<p>The effect of those vermin emerging from that broken wall was almost
intolerably sickening; the suggestion was that of maggots squirming out of a
cracked and bleached skull.</p>

<p>Turning, I caught Altha up in one arm and raced across the open space.
They followed fleetingly, running now on all fours, and now upright like a
man. And suddenly they broke out into their hellish laughter again, and I saw
we were trapped. Ahead of me were more emerging from some other subterranean
entrance. We were cut off.</p>

<p>A giant pedestal, from which the column had been broken, stood before us.
With a bound I reached it, set the girl on the jagged pinnacle, and wheeled
on the lower base to take such toll of our pursuers as I might. Blood
streaming from a score of gashes trickled down the pedestal on which I stood,
and I shook my head violently to rid my eyes of blinding sweat.</p>

<p>They ringed me in a wide semicircle, deliberate now that their prey seemed
certain, and I cannot recall a time when I was more revolted by horror and
disgust, than when I stood with my back to that marble pillar and faced those
verminous monsters of the lower world.</p>

<p>Then my attention was caught by a movement in the shadows under the wall
through which we had just come. Something was emerging from the
rift&mdash;something huge and black and bulky. I caught the glitter of a
yellowish spark. Fascinated, I watched, even while the furred devils were
closing in. Now the thing had emerged entirely from the rift. I saw it
crouching in the shadow of the wall, a squat mass of blackness from which
glimmered a pair of yellowish lights. With a start I recognized the eyes I
had seen in the subterranean cell.</p>

<p>With a clamor of fiendish yells the furry devils rushed in, and at the
same instant the unknown creature ran out into the moonlight with surprising
speed and agility. I saw it plainly then&mdash;a gigantic spider, bigger than
an ox. Moving with the swiftness characteristic of its breed, it was among
the dog-heads before the first had felt my lifted sword. An awful scream rose
from its first victim, and the rest, turning, broke and fled shrieking in all
directions. The monster raged among them with appalling quickness and
ferocity. Its huge jaws crunched their skulls, its dripping mandibles
skewered them, it crushed their bodies by its sheer weight. In an instant the
place was a shambles, inhabited only by the dead and dying. Crouching among
its victims, the great black hairy thing fixed its horribly intelligent eyes
on me.</p>

<p>I was the one it was trailing. I had awakened it underground, and it had
followed the scent of the dried blood on my sandals. It had slaughtered the
others simply because they stood in its way.</p>

<p>As it crouched on its eight bent legs, I saw that it differed from Earthly
spiders not only in size, but in the number of its eyes and the shape of its
jaws. Now Altha screamed as it ran swiftly toward me.</p>

<p>But where the fangs and claws of a thousand beast-things were futile
against the venom dripping from those black mandibles, the brain and thews of
a single man prevailed. Catching up a heavy block of masonry, I poised it for
an instant, and then hurled it straight into the onrushing bulk. Full among
those branching hairy legs it crushed, and a jet of nauseous green stuff
gushed into the air from the torn torso. The monster, halted in his rush,
writhed under the pinning stone, cast it aside and staggered toward me again,
dragging broken legs, its eyes glittering hellishly. I tore another missile
from the crumbling stone, and another and another, raining huge chunks of
marble on the writhing horror until it lay still in a ghastly mess of
squirming hairy black legs, entrails and blood.</p>

<p>Then catching Altha in my arms, I raced away through the shadows of
monolith and tower and pillar, nor did I halt until the city of silence and
mystery lay behind us, and we saw the moon setting across the broad waving
grasslands.</p>

<p>No word had passed between us since I had first come upon the girl in that
ghoulish tunnel. Now when I looked down to speak to her I saw her dark head
drooping against my arm; her white face was upturned, her eyes shut. A quick
throb of fear went through me, but a swift examination showed me that she had
merely fainted. That fact showed the horror of what she had been through. The
women of Koth do not faint easily.</p>

<p>I laid her at full length on the turf, and gazed at her helplessly,
noting, as if for the first time, the white firmness of her slender limbs,
the exquisite molding of her supple figure. Her dark hair fell in thick
glossy clusters about her alabaster shoulders, a strap of her tunic, slipped
down, revealed her firm, pink-tipped young breasts. I was aware of a vague
unrest that was almost a pain.</p>

<p>Altha opened her eyes and looked up at me. Then her dark eyes flared with
terror, and she cried out and clutched at me frantically. My arms closed
about her instinctively, and within their iron-thewed clasp I felt the
pulsating of her lithe body, the wild fluttering of her heart.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid." My voice sounded strange, scarcely
articulate. "Nothing is going to harm you."</p>

<p>I could feel her heart resuming its normal beat, so closely she clung to
me, before her quick pants of fright ceased. But for a while she lay in my
arms, looking up at me without speaking, until, embarrassed, I released her
and lifted her to a sitting position on the grass.</p>

<p>"As soon as you feel fit," I said, "we'll put more
distance between us and&mdash;that." I jerked my head in the direction
of the distant ruins.</p>

<p>"You are hurt," she exclaimed suddenly, tears filling her
eyes. "You are bleeding! Oh, I am to blame. If I had not run
away&mdash;" She was weeping now in earnest, like any Earthly girl.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about these scratches," I answered, though
privately I was wondering if the fangs of the vermin were venomous.
"They are only flesh wounds. Stop crying, will you?"</p>

<p>She obediently stifled her sobs, and naively dried her eyes with her
skirt. I did not wish to remind her of her horrible experience, but I was
curious on one point.</p>

<p>"Why did the Yagas halt at the ruins?" I asked. "Surely
they knew of the things that haunt such cities."</p>

<p>"They were hungry," she answered with a shudder. "They
had captured a youth&mdash;they dismembered him alive, but never a cry for
mercy they got, only curses. Then they roasted&mdash;" She gagged,
smitten with nausea.</p>

<p>"So the Yagas are cannibals." I muttered.</p>

<p>"No. They are devils. While they sat about the fire the dog-heads
fell upon them. I did not see them until they were on us. They swarmed over
the Yagas like jackals over deer. Then they dragged me into the darkness.
What they meant to do, Thak only knows. I have heard&mdash;but it is too
obscene to repeat."</p>

<p>"But why did they shriek my name?" I marveled.</p>

<p>"I cried it aloud in my terror," she answered. "They
heard and mimicked me. When you came, they knew you. Do not ask me how. They
too are devils."</p>

<p>"This planet is infested with devils," I muttered. "But
why did you call on me, in your fright, instead of your father?"</p>

<p>She colored slightly, and instead of answering, began pulling her tunic
straps in place.</p>

<p>Seeing that one of her sandals had slipped off, I replaced it on her small
foot, and while I was so occupied she asked unexpectedly: "Why do they
call you Ironhand? Your fingers are hard, but their touch is as gentle as a
woman's. I never had men's fingers touch me so lightly before.
More often they have hurt me."</p>

<p>I clenched my fist and regarded it moodily&mdash;a knotted iron mallet of
a fist. She touched it timidly.</p>

<p>"It's the feeling behind the hand." I answered.
"No man I ever fought complained that my fists were gentle. But it is
my enemies I wish to hurt, not you."</p>

<p>Her eyes lighted. "You would not hurt me? Why?"</p>

<p>The absurdity of the question left me speechless.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a id="almuric7"
name="almuric7">CHAPTER 7</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT WAS PAST SUNRISE when we started back on the long trek
toward Koth, swinging far to the west to avoid the devil city from which we
had escaped. The sun came up unusually hot. The air was breathless, the light
morning wind blew fitfully, and then died down entirely. The always cloudless
sky had a faint copperish tint. Altha eyed that sky apprehensively, and in
answer to my question said she feared a storm. I had supposed the weather to
be always clear and calm and hot on the plains, clear and windy and cold in
the hills. Storms had not entered into my calculation.</p>

<p>The beasts we saw shared her uneasiness. We skirted the edge of the
forest, for Altha refused to traverse it until the storm had passed. Like
most plains-dwellers, she had an instinctive distrust of thick woods. As we
strode over the grassy undulations, we saw the herds of grazers milling
confusedly. A drove of jumping pigs passed us, covering the ground with
gargantuan bounds of thirty and forty feet. A lion started up in front of us
with a roar, but dropped his massive head and slunk hurriedly away through
the tall grass.</p>

<p>I kept looking for clouds, but saw none. Only the copperish tint about the
horizons grew, discoloring the whole sky. It turned from light color to dull
bronze, and from bronze to black. The sun smoldered for a little like a
veiled torch, veining the dusky dome with fire, then it was blotted out. A
tangible darkness seemed to hover an instant in the sky, then rush down,
cloaking the world in utter blackness, through which shone neither sun, moon,
nor stars. I had never guessed how impenetrable darkness could be. I might
have been a blind, disembodied spirit wandering through unlighted space, but
for the swish of the grasses under my feet, and the soft warm contact of
Altha's body against mine. I began to fear we might fall into a river,
or blunder against some equally blind beast of prey.</p>

<p>I had been making for a mass of broken boulders, such a formation as
occasionally occurs on the plains. Darkness fell before we reached them, but
groping on, I stumbled upon a sizable rock, and placing my back to it, drew
Altha against it and stood sheltering her with my body as well as I could.
Out on the dark plains breathless silence alternated with the sounds of
varied and widespread movement&mdash;rustling of grass, shuffle of padded
hoofs, weird lowing and low-pitched roaring. Once a vast herd of some sort
swept by us, and I was thankful for the protection of the boulders that kept
us from being trampled. Again all sounds ceased and the silence was as
complete as the darkness. Then from somewhere came a weird howling.</p>

<p>"What's that?" I asked uneasily, unable to classify
it.</p>

<p>"The wind!" she shivered, snuggling closer to me.</p>

<p>It did not blow with a steady blast; here and there it swept in mad fitful
gusts. Like lost souls it wailed and moaned. It ripped the grasses near us,
and finally a puff of it struck us squarely, knocking us off our feet and
bruising us against the boulder behind us. Just that one abrupt blast, like a
buffet from an unseen giant's fist.</p>

<p>As we regained our feet I froze. Something was passing near our
refuge&mdash;something mountain-huge, beneath whose tread the earth trembled.
Altha caught me in a desperate clutch, and I felt the pounding of her heart.
My hair prickled with nameless fear. The <i>thing</i> was even with us. It
halted, as if sensing our presence. There was a curious leathery sound, as of
the movement of great limbs. Something waved in the air above us; then I felt
a touch on my elbow. The same object touched Altha's bare arm, and she
screamed, her taut nerves snapping.</p>

<p>Instantly our ears were deafened by an awful bellow above us, and
something swept down through the darkness with a clashing of gigantic teeth.
Blindly I lashed out and upward, feeling my sword-edge meet tangible
substance. A warm liquid spurted along my arm, and with another terrible
roar, this time more of pain than rage, the invisible monster shambled away,
shaking the earth with its tread, dimming the shrieking wind with its
bellowing.</p>

<p><br>"What was it, in God's name?" I panted.</p>

<p>"It was one of the Blind Ones," she whispered. "No man
has ever seen them; they dwell in the darkness of the storm. Whence they
come, whither they go, none knows. But look, the darkness melts."</p>

<p>"Melts" was the right word. It seemed to shred out, to tear in
long streamers. The sun came out, the sky showed blue from horizon to
horizon. But the earth was barred fantastically with long strips of darkness,
tangible shadows floating on the plain, with broad spaces of sunlight
between. The scene might have been a dream landscape of an opium-eater. A
hurrying deer flitted across a sunlight band and vanished abruptly in a broad
streamer of black; as suddenly it flashed into light and sight again. There
was no gradual shaking into darkness; the borders of the torn strips of
blackness were as clear-cut and definite as ribbons of ebony on a background
of gold and emerald. As far as I could see, the world was stripped and barred
with those black ribbons. Sight could not pierce them, but they were
thinning, dividing, vanishing.</p>

<p>Directly before one of the streamers of darkness ripped apart and
disappeared, revealing the figure of a man&mdash;a hairy giant, who stood
glaring at me, sword in hand, as surprised as I. Then several things happened
all at once. Altha screamed: "A Thugran!" the stranger leaped and
slashed, and his sword clanged on my lifted blade.</p>

<p>I have only a brief chaotic memory of the next few seconds. There was a
whirl of strokes and parries, a brief clanging of steel; then my sword-point
sank under his heart and stood out behind his back. I wrenched the blade free
as he sank down, and stood glaring down at him bewilderedly. I had secretly
wondered what the outcome would be when I was called upon to face a seasoned
warrior with naked steel. Now it had occurred and was over with, and I was
absolutely unable to remember how I had won. It had been too fast and furious
for conscious thought; my fighting instincts had acted for me.</p>

<p>A clamor of angry cries burst on me, and wheeling I saw a score of hairy
warriors swarming out from among the rocks. It was too late to flee. In an
instant they were on me, and I was the center of a whirling, flashing,
maelstrom of swords. How I parried them even for a few seconds I cannot say.
But I did, and even had the satisfaction of feeling my blade grate around
another, and sever the wielder's shoulder bone. A moment later one
stooped beneath my thrust and drove the spear through the calf of my leg.
Maddened by the pain, I dealt him a stroke that split his skull to the chin,
and then a carbine stock descended on my head. I partially parried the blow,
else it had smashed my skull. But even so, it beat down on my crown with
thunderous and murderous impact, and the lights went out.</p>

<p>I came to with the impression that I was lying in a small boat which was
rocking and tossing in a storm. Then I discovered that I was bound hand and
foot, and being borne on a litter made of spear-shafts. Two huge warriors
were bearing me between them, and they made no effort to make the traveling
any easier for me. I could see only the sky, the hairy back of the warrior in
front of me, and by drawing back my head the bearded face of the warrior
behind. This person, seeing my eyes open, growled a word to his mate, and
they promptly dropped the litter. The jolt set my damaged head to throbbing,
and the wound in my leg to hurting abominably.</p>

<p>"Logar!" bawled one of them. "The dog is conscious. Make
him walk, if you must bring him to Thugra. I've carried him far as
I'm going to."</p>

<p>I heard footsteps, and then above me towered a giant form and a face that
seemed familiar. It was a fierce, brutal face, and from the corner of the
snarling mouth to the rim of the square jaw, ran a livid scar.</p>

<p>"Well, Esau Cairn," said this individual, "we meet
again."</p>

<p>I made no reply to this obvious comment.</p>

<p>"What?" he sneered, "do you not remember Logar the
Bonecrusher, you hairless dog?"</p>

<p>He punctuated his remarks by a savage kick in my ribs. Somewhere there
rang out a feminine shriek of protest, the sound of a scuffle, and Altha
broke through the ring of warriors and fell to her knees beside me.</p>

<p>"Beast!" she cried, her beautiful eyes blazing. "You
kick him when he is helpless, when you would not dare face him in fair
battle."</p>

<p>"Who let this Kothan cat loose?" roared Logar. "Thal, I
told you to keep her away from this dog."</p>

<p>"She bit my hand," snarled the big warrior, striding forward,
and shaking a drop of blood from his hairy paw. "I'd as soon try
to hold a spitting wildcat."</p>

<p>"Well, haul him to his feet." directed Logar. "He walks
the rest of the way."</p>

<p>"But he is wounded in the leg!" wailed Altha. "He cannot
walk."</p>

<p>"Why don't you finish him here?" demanded one of the
warriors.</p>

<p>"Because that would be too easy!" roared Logar, red lights
flickering in his blood-shot eyes. "The thief struck me foully with a
stone, from behind, and stole my poniard."&mdash;here I saw that he was
wearing it once more at his girdle. "He shall go to Thugra, and there
I'll take my time about killing him. Drag him up!"</p>

<p>They loosened my legs, none too gently, but the wounded one was so stiff I
could hardly stand, much less walk. They encouraged me with blows, kicks, and
prods from spears and swords, while Altha wept in helpless fury, and at last
turned on Logar.</p>

<p>"You are both a liar and a coward!" she screamed. "He
did not strike you with a stone&mdash;he beat you down with his naked fists,
as all men know, though your slaves dare not acknowledge it&mdash;"</p>

<p>Logar's knotty fist crashed against her jaw, knocking her off her
feet, to fall in a crumpled heap a dozen feet away. She lay without moving,
blood trickling from her lips. Logar grunted in savage satisfaction, but his
warriors were silent. Moderate corporal correction for women was not unknown
among the Guras, but such excessive and wanton brutality was repugnant to any
warrior of average decency. So Logar's braves looked glum, though they
made no verbal protest.</p>

<p>As for me, I went momentarily blind with the red madness of fury that
swept over me. With a blood-thirsty snarl I jerked convulsively, upsetting
the two men who held me; so we all went down in a heap. The other Thugrans
came and boosted us up, glad to vent their outraged feelings on my carcass,
which they did lustily, with sandal heels and sword hilts. But I did not feel
the blows that rained upon me. The whole world was swimming red to my sight,
and speech had utterly failed me. I could only snarl bestially as I tore in
vain at the thongs which bound me. When I lay exhausted, my captors hauled me
up and began beating me to make me walk.</p>

<p>"You can beat me to death," I snarled, finding my voice at
last, "but I won't move until some of you see to the
girl."</p>

<p>"The slut's dead," growled Logar.</p>

<p>"You lie, you dog!" I spat. "You miserable weakling, you
couldn't hit hard enough to kill a new-born babe!"</p>

<p>Logar bellowed in wordless fury, but one of the others, panting from his
exertions of hammering me, stepped over to Altha, who was showing signs of
life.</p>

<p>"Let her lie!" roared Logar.</p>

<p>"Go to the devil!" snarled his warrior. "I love her no
more than you do, but if bringing her along will make that smooth-skinned
devil walk of his own accord, I'll bring her, if I have to carry her
all the way. He's not human; I've pummeled him till I'm
ready to drop dead, and he's in better shape than I."</p>

<p>So Altha, wobbly on her legs and very groggy, accompanied us as we marched
to Thugra.</p>

<p><br>We were on the road several days, during which time walking was agony to
my wounded leg. Altha persuaded the warriors to let her bandage my wounds,
and but for that I very probably should have died. I was marked in many
places by the gashes received in the haunted ruins, battered and bruised from
head to foot by the beating the Thugrans gave me. Just enough food and water
was given me to keep me alive. And so, dazed, weary, harassed by thirst and
hunger, crippled, stumbling along over those endless rolling plains, I was
even glad at last to see the walls of Thugra looming in the distance, even
though I knew they spelled my doom. Altha had not been badly treated on the
march, but she had been prevented from giving me aid and comfort, beyond
bandaging my wounds, and all through the nights, waking from the beastlike
sleep of utter exhaustion, I heard her sobbing. Among the hazy, tortured
impression of that dreary trek, that stands out most clearly&mdash;Altha
sobbing in the night, terrible with loneliness and despair in the immensity
of shadowed world and moaning darkness.</p>

<p>And so we came to Thugra. The city was almost exactly like Koth&mdash;the
same huge tower-flanked gates, massive walls built of rugged green stone, and
all. The people, too, differed none in the main essentials from the Kothans.
But I found that their government was more like an absolute monarchy than was
Koth's. Logar was a primitive despot, and his will was the last power.
He was cruel, merciless, lustful and arrogant. I will say this for him: he
upheld his rule by personal strength and courage. Thrice during my captivity
in Thugra I saw him kill a rebellious warrior in hand-to-hand
combat&mdash;once with his naked hands against the other's sword.
Despite his faults, there was force in the man, a gusty, driving, dynamic
power that beat down opposition with sheer brutality. He was like a roaring
wind, bending or breaking all that stood before him.</p>

<p>Possessed of incredible vitality, he was intensely vain of his physical
prowess&mdash;in which, I believe, his superiority of personality was rooted.
That was why he hated me so terribly. That was why he lied to his people and
told them that I struck him with a stone. That was why, too, he refused to
put the matter to test. In his heart lurked fear&mdash;not of any bodily harm
I might do him, but fear lest I overcome him again, and discredit him in the
eyes of his subjects. It was his vanity that made a beast of Logar.</p>

<p>I was confined in a cell, chained to the wall. Logar came every day to
curse and taunt me. It was evident that he wished to exhaust all mental forms
of torment before he proceeded to physical torture. I did not know what had
become of Altha. I had not seen her since first we entered the city. He swore
that he had taken her to his palace and described to me with great detail the
salacious indignities to which he swore he subjected her. I did not believe
him, for I felt he would be more likely to bring her to my cell and torture
her before me. But the fury into which his obscene narrations threw me could
not have been much more violent if the scenes he described had been enacted
before me.</p>

<p>It was easy to see that the Thugrans did not relish Logar's humor,
for they were no worse than other Guras, and all Guras possess, as a race, an
innate decency in regard to women. But Logar's power was too complete
for any to venture a protest. At last, however, the warrior who brought me
food told me that Altha had disappeared immediately after we reached the
city, and that Logar was searching for her, but unable to find her.
Apparently she had either escaped from Thugra, or was hiding somewhere in the
city.</p>

<p>And so the slow days crawled by.</p>
<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="almuric8"
name="almuric8">CHAPTER 8</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT WAS MIDNIGHT when I awoke suddenly. The torch in my cell
was flickering and guttering. The guard was gone from my door. Outside, the
night was full of noise. Curses, yells, and shots mingled with the clash of
steel, and over all rose the screaming of women. This was accompanied by a
curious thrashing sound in the air above. I tore at my bonds, mad to know
what was happening. There was fighting in the city, beyond the shadow of a
doubt, but whether civil war or alien invasion, I could not know.</p>

<p>Then quick light steps sounded outside, and Altha ran swiftly into my
cell. Her hair was in wild disorder, her scanty garment torn, her eyes ablaze
with terror.</p>

<p>"Esau!" she cried. "Doom from the sky has fallen on
Thugra! The Yagas have descended on the city by the thousands! There is
fighting in the streets and on the house tops&mdash;the gutters are running
red, and the streets are strewn with corpses! Look! The city is
burning!"</p>

<p>Through the high-set barred windows I saw a smoldering glow. Somewhere
sounded the dry crackling of flames. Altha was sobbing as she fumbled vainly
at my bonds. That day Logar had begun the physical torture, and had had me
hauled upright and suspended from the roof by a rawhide thong bound about my
wrists, my toes just touching a huge block of granite. But Logar had not been
so wise. They had used a new thong of hide, and it had stretched, allowing my
feet to rest on the block, in which position I had suffered no unbearable
anguish, and had even fallen asleep, though naturally the attitude was not
conducive to great comfort.</p>

<p>As Altha worked futilely to free me, I asked her where she had been, and
she answered that she had slipped away from Logar when we had reached the
city, and that kind women, pitying her, had hidden and fed her. She had been
waiting for an opportunity to aid me in escaping. "And now," she
wailed, wringing her hands, "I can do nothing! I cannot untie this
wretched noose!"</p>

<p>"Go find a knife!" I directed. "Quick!"</p>

<p>Even as she turned, she cried out and shrank back, trembling, as a
terrible figure lurched through the door.</p>

<p>It was Logar, his mane and beard matted and singed, the hair on his great
breast crisped and blackened, blood streaming from his limbs. His blood-shot
eyes glared madness as he reeled toward me, lifting the poniard I had taken
from him so long before.</p>

<p>"Dog!" he croaked. "Thugra is doomed! The winged devils
drop from the skies like vultures on a dead ox! I have slain until I die of
weariness, yet still they come. But I remembered you. I could not rest easy
in Hell, knowing you still lived. Before I go forth again to die, I'll
send you before me!"</p>

<p>Altha shrieked and ran to shield me, but he was before her. Rising on his
toes he caught at my girdle, lifting the poniard on high. And as he did so, I
drove my knee with terrific force up against his jaw. The impact must have
broken his bull-neck like a twig. His shaggy head shot back between his
shoulders, his bearded chin pointing straight up. He went down like a
slaughtered ox, his head crashing hard on the stone floor.</p>

<p>A low laugh sounded from the doorway. Etched in the opening stood a tall
ebony shape, wings half lifted, a dripping scimitar in a crimsoned hand.
Limned in the murky red glare behind him, the effect was that of a
black-winged demon standing in the flame-lit door of Hell. The passionless
eyes regarded me enigmatically, flitted across the crumpled form on the
floor, then rested on Altha, cowering at my feet.</p>

<p>Calling something over his shoulder, the Yaga advanced into the room,
followed by a score of his kind. Many of them bore wounds, and their swords
were notched and dripping.</p>

<p>"Take them," the first comer indicated Altha and myself.</p>

<p>"Why the man?" demurred one.</p>

<p>"Who ever saw a white man with blue eyes before? He will interest
Yasmeena. But be careful. He has the thews of a lion."</p>

<p>One of them grasped Altha's arm and dragged her away, struggling
vainly and twisting her head to stare back at me with terrified eyes, and the
others from a safe distance cast a silken net about my feet. While my limbs
were so enmeshed, they seized me, bound me with silken cords that a lion
could not have broken, and cut the thong by which I was suspended. Then two
of them lifted me and bore me out of the cell. We emerged into a scene of
frenzy in the streets.</p>

<p>The stone walls were of course immune to flame, but the woodwork of the
buildings was ablaze. Smoke rolled up in great billowing clouds, shot and
veined by tongues of flame, and against this murky background black shapes
twisted and contorted like figments of nightmare. Through the black clouds
shot what appeared to be blazing meteors, until I saw they were winged men
bearing torches.</p>

<p>In the streets, among falling sparks and crashing walls, in the burning
buildings, on the roofs, desperate scenes were being hideously enacted. The
men of Thugra were fighting with the fury of dying panthers. Any one of them
was more than a match for a single Yaga, but the winged devils far
outnumbered them, and their fiendish agility in the air balanced the superior
strength and courage of the apemen. Swooping down through the air, they
slashed with their curved swords, soaring out of reach again before the
victim could return the stroke. When three or four devils were striking thus
at a single enemy, the butchery was certain and swift. The smoke did not seem
to bother them as it did their human adversaries. Some, perched on points of
vantage, bent bows and sent arrows singing down into the struggling masses in
the streets.</p>

<p>The killing was not all on one side. Winged bodies as well as hairy shapes
lay strewn in the blood-splashed streets. Carbines cracked and more than a
few flying fiends crashed earthward in a frantic thrashing of wings. Madly
lashing swords found their target, and when the desperate hands of a Gura
closed on a Yaga, that Yaga died horribly.</p>

<p>But by far the greater slaughter was among the Thugrans. Blinded and half
strangled, most of their bullets and arrows went wild. Outnumbered and
bewildered by the hawklike tactics of their merciless foes, they fought
vainly, were cut down or feathered with arrows.</p>

<p>The main object of the Yagas seemed to be women captives. Again and again
I saw a winged man soar up through the whirling smoke, gripping a shrieking
girl in his arms.</p>

<p>Oh, it was a sickening sight! I do not believe that the utter barbarism
and demoniac cruelty of the scene could be duplicated on Earth, vicious as
its inhabitants can be at times. It was not like humans fighting humans, but
like members of two different forms of life at war, utterly without sympathy
or any common plane of understanding.</p>

<p>But the massacre was not complete. The Yagas were quitting the city they
had ruined, sweeping up into the skies laden with naked writhing captives.
The survivors still held the streets, and fired blindly at the departing
victors, evidently preferring to risk killing their captives rather than to
let them be carried to the fate that awaited them.</p>

<p>I saw a knot of perhaps a hundred struggling fighters slashing and gasping
on the highest roof in the city, the Yagas to tear away and escape, the Guras
to drag them down. Smoke billowed about them, flames caught at their hair;
then with a thunderous roar the roof fell in, bearing victors and vanquished
alike to a fiery death. The deafening thunder of the devouring flames was in
my ears as my captors whirled me through the air away from the reeking city
of Thugra.</p>

<p>When my dazed faculties adjusted themselves sufficiently for me to take
note of my surroundings, I found myself sailing through the sky at terrific
speed, while below, above and about me sounded the steady beat of mighty
wings. Two Yagas were bearing me with perfect ease, and I was in the midst of
the band, which was flying southward in a wedge-shaped formation, like that
of wild geese. There were fully ten thousand of them. They darkened the
morning sky, and their gigantic shadow swept over the plain beneath them as
the sun rose.</p>

<p>We were flying at an altitude of about a thousand feet. Many of the winged
men bore girls and young women, and carried them with an ease that spoke of
incredible wing-power. No match in sheer muscularity for the Guras, yet these
winged devils have unbelievable powers of endurance in the air. They can fly
for hours at top speed, and in the wedge formation, with unburdened leaders
cleaving the air ahead of them, can carry weights almost equal their own at
almost the same velocity.</p>

<p>We did not pause to rest or eat until nightfall, when our captors
descended to the plain, where they built fires and spent the night. That
night lives in my memory as one of the greatest horrors I have ever endured.
We captives were given no food, but the Yagas ate. And their food was their
miserable captives. Lying helpless, I shut my eyes to that butchery, wished
that I were deaf that I might not hear the heart-rending cries. The butchery
of men I can endure, in battle, even in red massacre. The wanton slaughter of
helpless women who can only shriek for mercy until the knife silences their
wails, that is more than I can stand. Nor did I know but that Altha was among
those chosen for the grisly feast. With each hiss and crunch of the beheading
blade I winced, seeing in fancy her lovely dark head roll on the blood-soaked
ground. For what was going on at the other fires I could not know.</p>

<p>After it was over and the gorged demons lay about the fires in slumber, I
lay sick at heart, listening to the roaring of the prowling lions, and
reflecting how kinder and more gentle is any beast, than any thing molded in
the form of man. And out of my sick horror grew a hate that steeled me for
whatever might come, in the grim determination to ultimately repay these
winged monsters for all the suffering they had inflicted.</p>

<p><br>Dawn was only a hint in the sky when we took the air again. There was no
morning meal. I was to learn that the Yagas ate only at intervals, gorging
themselves to capacity every few days. After several hours hurtling over the
usual grasslands, we came suddenly in sight of a broad river spanning the
savannas from horizon to horizon, fringed on the northern bank by a narrow
belt of forest. The waters were of a curious purple, glimmering like watered
silk. On the farther bank appeared a tall thin tower of a black shiny
material that glittered like polished steel.</p>

<p>As we whirled over the river I saw that it was rushing with terrific
velocity. Its roar came up to us, and I saw the seething of eddying
whirlpools in its racing current. Crossing the stream at the point where the
tower stood, reared numbers of huge stones, among which the waters foamed and
thundered. Looking down at the tower, I saw half a dozen winged men on the
battlemented roof, who tossed up their arms as if hailing our captors. From
the river southward stretched desert&mdash;bare, dusty, grayish, strewn
occasionally with bleached bones here and there. Far away on the horizon I
saw a giant black bulk growing in the sky.</p>

<p>It stood out boldly as we raced toward it. In a few hours we had reached
it, and I was able to make out all its details. It was a gigantic block of
black basaltlike rock rising sheer out of the desert, a broad river flowing
about its feet, its summit crowned with black towers, minarets and castles.
It was no myth, then, but a fantastic reality&mdash;Yugga, the Black City,
the stronghold of the winged people.</p>

<p>The river, cutting through the naked desert, split on that great rock and
passed about it on either side, forming a natural moat. On every side but one
the waters lapped the sheer walls of the cliffs. But on one side a broad
beach had been formed, and there stood another town. Its style of
architecture was very different from that of the edifices on the rock. The
houses were mere stone huts, squat, flat-roofed, and one-storied. Only one
building had any pretensions&mdash;a black templelike edifice built against
the cliff wall. This lower town was protected by a strong stone wall built
about it at the water's edge, and connecting at each end with the cliff
behind the town.</p>

<p>I saw the inhabitants, and saw that they were neither Yagas nor Guras.
They were short and squat of build, and of a peculiar blue color. Their
faces, while more like those of Earthly humans than were those of the Gura
males, lacked the intelligence of the latter. The countenances were dull,
stupid and vicious, the women being little more prepossessing than the men. I
saw these curious people, not only in their town at the foot of the cliff,
but at work in fields along the river.</p>

<p>I had little opportunity for observing them, however, since the Yagas
swept straight up to the citadel, which towered five hundred feet above the
river. I was bewildered by the array of battlements, pinnacles, minarets and
roof gardens that met my gaze, but got the impression that the city on the
rock was built like one huge palace, each part connected with the rest.
Figures lounging on couches on the flat roofs lifted themselves on elbow, and
from scores of casements the faces of women looked at us as we sank down on a
broad flat roof that was something like a landing-field. There many of the
winged men dispersed, leaving the captives guarded by three or four hundred
warriors, who herded them through a gigantic door. There were about five
hundred of these wretched girls, Altha among them. I was carried, still
bound, along with them. By this time my whole body was numb from having
circulation cut off so long, but my mind was intensely active.</p>

<p>We traversed a stairway down which half a dozen elephants could have
stalked abreast, and came into a corridor of corresponding vastness. Walls,
stair, ceiling and floor were all of the gleaming black stone, which I
decided had been cut out of the rock on which Yugga was built, and highly
polished. So far I had seen no carvings, tapestries, or any attempt at
ornamentation; yet it could not be denied that the effect of those lofty
walls and vaulted ceilings of polished ebony was distinctly one of splendor.
There was an awe-inspiring majesty about the architecture which seemed
incongruous, considering the beastliness of the builders. Yet the tall black
figures did not seem out of place, moving somberly through those great ebony
halls. The Black City&mdash;not alone because its walls were dusky hued did
humans give it that sinister name.</p>

<p>As we passed through those lofty halls I saw many of the inhabitants of
Yugga. Besides the winged men, I saw, for the first time, the women of the
Yagas. Theirs was the same lithe build, the same glossy black skin, the same
faintly hawklike cast of countenance. But the women were not winged. They
were clad in short silken skirts held up with jewel-crusted girdles, and in
filmy sashes bound about their breasts. But for the almost intangible cruelty
of their faces, they were beautiful. Their dusky features were straight and
clear-cut, their hair was not kinky.</p>

<p>I saw other women, hundreds of the black-haired, white-skinned daughters
of the Guras. But there were others: small, dainty, yellow-skinned girls, and
copper-colored women&mdash;all, apparently, slaves to the black people. These
women were something new and unexpected. All the fantastic forms of life I
had encountered so far had been mentioned in tales or legends of the Kothans.
The dog-heads, the giant spider, the winged people with their black citadel
and their blue-skinned slaves&mdash;all these had been named in legendry, at
least. But no man or woman of Koth had ever spoken of women with yellow or
copper skins. Were these exotic prisoners from another planet, just as I was
from an alien world?</p>

<p>While meditating the matter I was carried through a great bronze portal at
which stood a score of winged warriors on guard, and found myself with the
captive girls in a vast chamber, octagonal in shape, the walls hung with
dusky tapestries. It was carpeted with some sort of rich furlike stuff, and
the air was heavy with perfumes and incense.</p>

<p>Toward the back of the chamber, broad steps of beaten gold led up to a
fur-covered dais, on which lounged a young black woman. She alone, of all the
Yaga women, was winged. She was dressed like the rest, wearing no ornaments
except her gem-crusted girdle, from which jutted a jeweled dagger hilt. Her
beauty was marvelous and disquieting, like the beauty of a soulless statue. I
sensed that of all the inhuman denizens of Yugga, she was least human. Her
brooding eyes spoke of dreams beyond the boundaries of human consciousness.
Her face was the face of a goddess, knowing neither fear nor mercy.</p>

<p>Ranged about her couch in attitudes of humility and servitude were twenty
naked girls, white-, yellow- and copper-skinned.</p>

<p>The leader of our captors advanced toward the royal dais, and bowing low,
at the same time extending his hands, palms down and fingers spread wide, he
said: "Oh, Yasmeena, Queen of the Night, we bring you the fruits of
conquest."</p>

<p>She raised herself on her elbow, and as her terribly personal gaze passed
over her cringing captives, a shudder swept across their ranks as a wind
passes over rows of wheat. From earliest childhood Gura girls were taught, by
tales and tradition, that the worst fate that could befall them was to be
captured by the people of the Black City. Yugga was a misty land of horror,
ruled by the archfiend Yasmeena. Now those trembling girls were face to face
with the vampire herself. What wonder that many of them fainted outright?</p>

<p>But her eyes passed over them and rested on me, where I stood propped up
between a couple of warriors. I saw interest grow in those dark luminous
eyes, and she spoke to the chief:</p>

<p>"Who is that barbarian, whose skin is white, yet almost as hairless
as ours, who is clad like a Gura, and yet unlike them?"</p>

<p>"We found him a captive among the Thugrans, oh mistress of
Night," he answered. "Your majesty shall herself question him.
And now, oh dark beauty, be pleased to designate the miserable wenches who
shall serve your loveliness, that the rest may be apportioned among the
warriors who made the raid."</p>

<p>Yasmeena nodded, her eyes still on me, and with a few waves of her hand
she indicated a dozen or so of the handsomest girls, among these being Altha.
They were drawn aside, and the rest were herded out.</p>

<p>Yasmeena eyed me a space without speaking, and then said to him who
appeared to be her major-domo: "Gotrah, this man is weary and stained
with travel and captivity, and there is an unhealed wound in his leg. The
sight of him, as he now is, offends me. Take him away, let him bathe and eat
and drink, and let his leg be bandaged. Then bring him to me
again."</p>

<p>So my captors with a weary sigh, heaved me up again, and carried me from
the royal chamber, down a winding corridor, along a flight of stairs, and
halted finally in a chamber where a fountain bubbled in the floor. There they
fastened gold chains to my wrists and ankles and then cut the cords that
bound me. In the excruciating pain of the returning circulation, I scarcely
noticed when they splashed me in the fountain, bathing the sweat, dirt and
dried blood from my limbs and body, and clad me in a new loincloth of scarlet
silk. They likewise dressed the wound in my calf, and then a copper-skinned
slave-girl entered with gold vessels of food. I would not touch the meat,
what with my grisly suspicions, but I ate ravenously of the fruits and nuts,
and drank deeply of a green wine, which I found most delicious and
refreshing.</p>

<p>After that I felt so drowsy that I sank down on a velvet couch and passed
instantly into deep slumber, from which I was roused by someone shaking me.
It was Gotrah bending over me with a short knife in his hand; and, all my
wild instincts aroused, I did my best to brain him with my clenched fist, and
failed only because of the chain on my wrist. He recoiled, cursing.</p>

<p>"I have not come to cut your throat, barbarian," he snapped,
"though nothing would please me better. The Kothan girl has told
Yasmeena that it is your habit to scrape the hair from your face, and it is
the Queen's desire to see you thus. Here, take this knife and scrape
yourself. It has no point, and I will be careful to stay out of your reach.
Here is a mirror."</p>

<p>Still half asleep&mdash;by which I believe the green wine was drugged,
though for what reason I cannot say&mdash;I propped the silver mirror up
against the wall, and went to work on my beard, which had reached no mean
proportions during my captivities. It was a dry shave, but my skin is as
durable as tanned leather, and the knife had an edge keener than I ever found
on an Earthly razor. When I had finished, Gotrah grunted at my changed
appearance and demanded the knife again. As there was no point in retaining
it, it being useless as a weapon, I threw it at him, and immediately fell
asleep again.</p>

<p>The next time I awoke naturally, and rising, took in my surroundings more
minutely. The chamber was unadorned, furnished only with the couch, a small
ebony table, and a fur-covered bench. There was a single door, which was
closed and doubtless bolted on the outside, and one window. My chains were
fastened to a gold ring in the wall behind the couch, but the strand that
linked me to it was long enough to allow me to take a few steps to the
fountain, and to the window. This window was barred with gold, and I looked
out over flat roofs, at towers and minarets which limited my view.</p>

<p>So far the Yagas had treated me well enough; I wondered how Altha was
faring, and if the position of member of the Queen's retinue carried
any special privileges or safety.</p>

<p>Then Gotrah entered again, with half a dozen warriors, and they unlocked
my chain from the wall and escorted me down the corridor, up the winding
stair. I was not taken back to the great throne chamber, but to a smaller
room high up in a tower. This room was so littered with furs and cushions
that it was almost stuffed. I was reminded of the soft, padded nest of a
spider, and the black spider was there&mdash;lounging on a velvet couch and
staring at me with avid curiosity. This time she was not attended by slaves.
The warriors chained me to the wall&mdash;every wall in that accursed palace
seemed to have rings for captives&mdash;and left us alone.</p>

<p>I leaned back among the furs and pillows, finding their downy contact
irksome to my iron-hard frame, unaccustomed to soft living of any kind, and
for a wearisome time the Queen of Yugga surveyed me without speaking. Her
eyes had a hypnotic quality; I distinctly felt their impact. But I felt too
much like a chained beast on exhibition to be aware of any feeling but one of
rising resentment. I fought it down. A burst of berserk fury might break the
slender chains that held me, and rid the world of Yasmeena, but Altha and I
would still be prisoners on that accursed rock from which legend said there
was no escape save through the air.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" Yasmeena demanded abruptly. "I have seen
men with skins smoother even than yours, but never a hairless white man
before."</p>

<p>Before I could ask her where she had seen hairless men, if not among her
own people, she continued: "Nor have I seen eyes like yours. They are
like a deep cold lake, yet they blaze and smolder like the cold blue flame
that dances forever above Xathar. What is your name? Whence come you? The
girl Altha said you came out of the wilderness and dwelt in her city,
defeating its mighty men in single combat. But she does not know from what
land you came, she says. Speak, and do not lie."</p>

<p>"I'll speak but you'll think I lie," I grunted.
"I am Esau Cairn, whom the men of Koth call Ironhand. I come from
another world in another solar system. Chance, or the whim of a scientist
whom you would call a magician, cast me on this planet. Chance again threw me
among the Kothans. Chance carried me to Yugga. Now I have spoken. Believe me
or not, as you will."</p>

<p>"I believe you," she answered. "Of old, men passed from
star to star. There are beings now which traverse the cosmos. I would study
you. You shall live&mdash;for a while, at least. But you must wear those
chains, for I read the fury of the beast in your eyes, and know you would
rend me if you could."</p>

<p>"What of Altha!" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, what of her?" She seemed surprised at the question.</p>

<p>"What have you done with her?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"She will serve me with the rest, until she displeases me. Why do
you speak of another woman, when you are talking to me? I am not
pleased."</p>

<p>Her eyes began to glitter. I never saw eyes like Yasmeena's. They
changed with every shift of mood and whim, and they mirrored passions and
angers and desires beyond the maddest dreams of humanity.</p>

<p>"You do not blench," she said softly. "Man, do you know
what it is for Yasmeena to be displeased? Then blood flows like water, Yugga
rings with screams of agony, and the very gods hide their heads in
horror."</p>

<p>The way she said it turned my blood cold, but the red anger of the
primitive would not down. The feel of my strength came upon me, and I knew
that I could tear that golden ring from the stone and rip out her life before
she could leap from her couch, if it came to that. So I laughed, and my
laughter thrummed with blood-lust. She started up and eyed me closely.</p>

<p>"Are you mad, to laugh?" she asked. "No, that was not
mirth&mdash;it was the growl of a hunting leopard. It is in your mind to leap
and kill me, but if you do, the girl Altha will suffer for your crime. Yet
you interest me. No man has ever laughed at me before. You shall
live&mdash;for a while." She clapped her hands and the warriors
entered. "Take him back to his chamber," she directed.
"Keep him chained there until I send for him again."</p>

<p>And so began my third captivity on Almuric, in the black citadel of Yugga,
on the rock Yuthla, by the river of Yogh, in the land of Yagg.</p>
<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="almuric9"
name="almuric9">CHAPTER 9</a></h2>

<p class="first">MUCH I LEARNED of the ways of that terrible people, who have
reigned over Almuric since ages beyond the memory of man. They might have
been human once, long ago, but I doubt it. I believe they represented a
separate branch on the tree of evolution, and that it is only an incredible
freak of coincidence which cast them in a mold so similar to man, instead of
the shapes of the abysmal, howling, blasphemous dwellers of Outer
Darkness.</p>

<p>In many ways they seemed, superficially, human enough, but if one followed
their lines of consciousness far enough, he would come upon phases
inexplicable and alien to humanity. As far as pure intellect went, they were
superior to the hairy Guras. But they lacked altogether the decency, honesty,
courage, and general manliness of the apemen. The Guras were quick to wrath,
savage and brutal in their anger; but there was a studied cruelty about the
Yagas which made the others seem like mere rough children. The Yagas were
merciless in their calmest moments; roused to anger, their excesses were
horrible to behold.</p>

<p>They were a numerous horde, the warriors alone numbering some twenty
thousand. There were more women than men, and with their slaves, of which
each male and female Yaga possessed a goodly number, the city of Yugga was
fully occupied. Indeed, I was surprised to learn of the multitudes of people
who dwelt there, considering the comparative smallness of the rock Yuthla on
which the city was built. But its space was greater vertically than
horizontally. The castles and towers soared high into the air, and several
tiers of chambers and corridors were sunk into the rock itself. When the
Yagas felt themselves crowded for space, they simply butchered their slaves.
I saw no children; losses in war were comparatively slight, and plagues and
diseases unknown. Children were produced only at regular intervals, some
three centuries apart. The last flock had come of age; the next brood was
somewhere in the dim distance of the future.</p>

<p>The lords of Yugga did no sort of work, but passed their lives in sensual
pleasures. Their knowledge and adeptness at debauchery would have shamed the
most voluptuous libertine in later Rome. Their debauches were interrupted
only by raids on the outer world in order to procure women slaves.</p>

<p>The town at the foot of the cliff was called Akka, the blue people Akki,
or Akkas. They had been subject to the Yagas as far back as tradition
extended. They were merely stupid work-animals, laboring in the irrigated
fields of fruits and edible plants, and otherwise doing the will of their
masters, whom they considered superior beings, if not veritable gods. They
worshipped Yasmeena as a deity. Outside of continual toil, they were not
mistreated. Their women were ugly and beastlike. The winged people had a keen
asthetic sense, though their interest in the beauty of the lower orders was
sadistic and altogether beastly. The Akkas never came into the upper city,
except when there was work to be done there, too heavy for the women slaves.
Then they ascended and descended by means of great silken ladders let down
from the rock. There was no road leading up from below, since the Yagas
needed none. The cliffs could not be scaled; so the winged people had no fear
of an Akka uprising.</p>

<p>The Yaga women were likewise prisoners on the rock Yuthla. Their wings
were carefully removed at birth. Only the infants destined to become queens
of Yugga were spared. This was done in order to keep the male sex in
supremacy, and indeed, I was never able to learn how, and at what distant
date, the men of Yugga gained supremacy over their women; for, judging from
Yasmeena, the winged women were superior to their mates in agility,
endurance, courage and even in strength. Clipping their wings kept them from
developing their full superiority.</p>

<p>Yasmeena was an example of what a winged woman could be. She was taller
than the other Yaga females, who in turn were taller than the Gura women, and
though voluptuously shaped, the steel thews of a wildcat lurked in her
slender rounded limbs. She was young&mdash;all the women of Yugga looked
young. The average life-span of the Yaga was nine hundred years. Yasmeena had
reigned over Yugga for four hundred years. Three winged princesses of royal
blood had contested with her for the right to rule, and she had slain each of
them, fighting with naked hands in the regal octagonal chamber. As long as
she could defend her crown against young claimants, she would rule.</p>

<p><br>The lot of the slaves in Yugga was hideous. None ever knew when she would
be dismembered for the cooking-pot, and the lives of all were tormented by
the cruel whims of their masters and mistresses. Yugga was as like Hell as
any place could be. I do not know what went on in the palaces of the nobles
and warriors, but I do know what took place daily in the palace of the Queen.
There was never a day or night that those dusky walls did not re-echo screams
of agony and piteous wails for mercy, mingled with vindictive maledictions,
or lascivious laughter.</p>

<p>I never became accustomed to it, hard as I was physically and mentally. I
think the only thing that kept me from going mad was the feeling that I must
keep my sanity in order to protect Altha if I could. That was precious
little; I was chained in my chamber; where the Kothan girl was, I had not the
slightest idea, except that she was somewhere in the palace of Yasmeena,
where she was protected from the lust of the winged men, but not from the
cruelty of her mistress.</p>

<p>In Yugga I heard sounds and saw sights not to be repeated&mdash;not even
to be remembered in dreams. Men and women, the Yagas were open and candid in
their evil. Their utter cynicism banished ordinary scruples of modesty and
common decency. Their bestialities were naked, unhidden and shameless. They
followed their desires with one another, and practised their tortures on
their wretched slaves with no attempt at concealment. Deeming themselves
gods, they considered themselves above the considerations that guide ordinary
humans. The women were more vicious than the men, if such a thing were
possible. The refinements of their cruelties toward their trembling slaves
cannot be even hinted at. They were versed in every art of torture, both
mental and physical. But enough. I can but hint at what is unrepeatable.</p>

<p>Those days of captivity seem like a dim nightmare. I was not badly
treated, personally. Each day I was escorted on a sort of promenade about the
palace&mdash;something on the order of giving a confined animal exercise. I
was always accompanied by seven or eight warriors armed to the teeth, and
always wore my chains. Several times on these promenades I saw Altha, going
about her duties, but she always averted her gaze and hurried by. I
understood and made no attempt to speak to her. I had placed her in jeopardy
already by speaking of her to Yasmeena. Better let the queen forget about
her, if possible. Slaves were safest when the Queen of Yagg remembered them
least.</p>

<p>Somewhere, somehow, I found in me power to throttle my red rage and blind
fury. When my very brain reeled with the lust to break my chains and explode
into a holocaust of slaughter, I held myself with iron grasp. And the fury
ate inward into my soul, crystallizing my hate. So the days passed, until the
night that Yasmeena again sent for me.</p>
<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="almuric10"
name="almuric10">CHAPTER 10</a></h2>

<p class="first">YASMEENA CUPPED HER CHIN in her slim hands and fixed her
great dark eyes on me. We were alone in a chamber I had never entered before.
It was night. I sat on a divan opposite her, my limbs unshackled. She had
offered me temporary freedom if I would promise not to harm her, and to go
back into shackles when she bade me. I had promised. I was never a clever
man, but my hate had sharpened my wits. I was playing a game of my own.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of, Esau Ironhand?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'm thirsty," I answered.</p>

<p>She indicated a crystal vessel near at hand. "Drink a little of the
golden wine&mdash;not much, or it will make you drunk. It is the most
powerful drink in the world. Not even I can quaff that vessel without lying
senseless for hours. And you are unaccustomed to it."</p>

<p>I sipped a little of it. It was indeed heady liquor.</p>

<p>Yasmeena stretched her limbs out on her couch, and asked: "Why do
you hate me? Have I not treated you well?"</p>

<p>"I have not said that I hated you," I countered. "You
are very beautiful. But you are cruel."</p>

<p>She shrugged her winged shoulders. "Cruel? I am a goddess. What have
I to do with either cruelty or mercy? Those qualities are for men. Humanity
exists for my pleasure. Does not all life emanate from me?"</p>

<p>"Your stupid Akkas may believe that," I replied; "but I
know otherwise, and so do you."</p>

<p>She laughed, not offended. "Well, I may not be able to create life,
but I can destroy life at will. I may not be a goddess, but you would find it
difficult to convince these foolish wenches who serve me that I am not
all-powerful. No, Ironhand; gods are only another name for <i>Power</i>. I am
Power on this planet; so I am a goddess. What do your hairy friends, the
Guras, worship?"</p>

<p>"They worship Thak; at least they acknowledge Thak as the creator
and preserver. They have no regular ritual of worship, no temples, altars or
priests. Thak is the Hairy One, the god in the form of man. He bellows in the
tempest, and thunders in the hills with the voice of the lion. He loves brave
men, and hates weaklings, but he neither harms nor aids. When a male child is
born, he blows into it courage and strength; when a warrior dies, he ascends
to Thak's abode, which is a land of celestial plains, river and
mountains, swarming with game, and inhabited by the spirits of departed
warriors, who hunt, fight and revel forever as they did in life."</p>

<p>She laughed. "Stupid pigs. Death is oblivion. We Yagas worship only
our own bodies. And to our bodies we make rich sacrifices with the bodies of
the foolish little people."</p>

<p>"Your rule cannot last forever," I was moved to remark.</p>

<p>"It <i>has</i> lasted since beyond the gray dawn of Time's
beginning. On the dark rock Yuthla my people have brooded through ages
uncountable. Before the cities of the Guras dotted the plains, we dwelt in
the land of Yagg. We were always masters. As we rule the Guras, so we ruled
the mysterious race which possessed the land before the Guras evolved from
the ape: the race which reared their cities of marble whose ruins now
affright the moon, and which perished in the night.</p>

<p>"Tales! I could tell you tales to blast your reason! I could tell
you of races which appeared from the mist of mystery, moved across the world
in restless waves, and vanished in the midst of oblivion. We of Yugga have
watched them come and go, each in turn bending beneath the yoke of our
godship. We have endured, not centuries or millenniums, but cycles.</p>

<p>"Why should not our rule endure forever? How shall these Gura-fools
overcome us? You have seen how it is when my hawks swoop from the air in the
night on the cities of the apeman. How then shall they attack us in our
eyrie? To reach the land of Yagg they must cross the Purple River, whose
waters race too swiftly to be swum. Only at the Bridge of Rocks can it be
crossed, and there keen-eyed guards watch night and day. Once, the Guras did
try to attack us. The watchers brought word of their coming and the men of
Yagg were prepared. In the midst of the desert they fell on the invaders and
destroyed them by thirst and madness and arrows showering upon them from the
skies.</p>

<p>"Suppose a horde should fight its way through the desert and reach
the rock Yuthla? They have the river Yogh to cross, and when they have
crossed it, in the teeth of the Akki spears, what then? They could not scale
the cliffs. No; no foreign foe will ever set foot in Yugga. If, by the
wildest whim of the gods, such a thing <i>should</i> come to
pass"&mdash;her beautiful features became even more cruel and
sinister&mdash;"rather than submit to conquest I would loose the
<i>Ultimate Horror</i>, and perish in the ruins of my city," she
whispered, more to herself than to me.</p>

<p>"What do you say?" I asked, not understanding.</p>

<p>"There are secrets beneath the velvet coverings of the darkest
secrets," she said. "Tread not where the very gods tremble. I
said nothing&mdash;you heard nothing. Remember that!"</p>

<p>There was silence for a space, and then I asked a question I had long
mulled over: "Whence come these red girls and yellow girls among your
slaves?"</p>

<p>"You have looked southward from the highest towers on clear days,
and seen a faint blue line rimming the sky far away? That is the Girdle that
bands the world. Beyond that Girdle dwell the races from which come those
alien slaves. We raid across the Girdle just as we raid the Guras, though
less frequently."</p>

<p>I was about to ask more concerning these unknown races, when a timid tap
came on the outer door. Yasmeena, frowning at the interruption, called a
sharp question, and a frightened feminine voice informed her that the lord
Gotrah desired audience. Yasmeena spat an oath at her, and bade her tell the
lord Gotrah to go to the devil.</p>

<p>"No, I must see the fellow," she said rising. "Theta!
Oh, Theta! Where has the little minx gone? I must do my own biddings, must I?
Her buttocks shall smart for her insolence. Wait here, Ironhand. I'll
see to Gotrah."</p>

<p>She crossed the cushion-strewn chamber with her lithe, long stride, and
passed through the door. As it closed behind her, I was struck by what was
nothing less than an inspiration. No especial reason occurred to me to urge
me to feign drunkenness. It was intuition or blind chance that prompted me.
Snatching up the crystal jug which contained the golden wine, I emptied it
into a great golden vessel which stood half hidden beneath the fringe of a
tapestry. I had drunk enough for the scent to be on my breath.</p>

<p>Then, as I heard footsteps and voices without, I extended myself quickly
on a divan, the jug lying on its side near my outstretched hand. I heard the
door open, and there was an instant's silence so intense as to be
almost tangible. Then Yasmeena spat like an angry cat. "By the gods,
he's emptied the jug? See how he lies in brutish slumber! Faugh! The
noblest figure is abominable when besotted. Well, let us to our task. We need
not fear to be overheard by him."</p>

<p>"Had I not better summon the guard and have him dragged to his
cell?" came Gotrah's voice. "We cannot afford to take
chances with this secret, which none has ever known except the Queen of Yugga
and her major-domo."</p>

<p>I sensed that they came and stood over me, looking down. I moved vaguely
and mumbled thickly, as if in drunken dreams.</p>

<p>Yasmeena laughed.</p>

<p>"No fear. He will know nothing before dawn. Yuthla could split and
fall into Yogh without breaking his sottish dreams. The fool! This night he
would have been lord of the world, for I would have made him lord of the
Queen of the world&mdash;for one night. But the lion changes not his mane,
nor the barbarian his brutishness."</p>

<p>"Why not put him to the torture?" grunted Gotrah.</p>

<p>"Because I want a man, not a broken travesty. Besides, his is a
spirit not to be conquered by fire or steel. No. I am Yasmeena and I will
make him love me before I feed him to the vultures. Have you placed the
Kothan Altha among the Virgins of the Moon?"</p>

<p>"Aye, Queen of the dusky stars. A month and a half from this night
she dances the dance of the Moon with the other wenches."</p>

<p>"Good. Keep them guarded day and night. If this tiger learns of our
plans for his sweetheart, chains and bolts will not hold him."</p>

<p>"A hundred and fifty men guard the virgins," answered Gotrah.
"Not even the Ironhand could prevail against them."</p>

<p>"It is well. Now to this other matter. Have you the
parchment?"</p>

<p>"Aye."</p>

<p>"Then I will sign it. Give me the stylus."</p>

<p>I heard the crackle of papyrus and the scratch of a keen point, and then
the Queen said:</p>

<p>"Take it now, and lay it on the altar in the usual place. As I
promise in the writing, I will appear in the flesh tomorrow night to my
faithful subjects and worshippers, the blue pigs of Akka. Ha! ha! ha! I never
fail to be amused at the animal-like awe on their stupid countenances when I
emerge from the shadows of the golden screen, and spread my arms above them
in blessing. What fools they are, not in all these ages, to have discovered
the secret door and the shaft that leads from their temple to this
chamber."</p>

<p>"Not so strange," grunted Gotrah. "None but the priest
ever comes into the temple except by special summons, and he is far too
superstitious to go meddling behind the screen. Anyway, there is no sign to
mark the secret door from without."</p>

<p>"Very well," answered Yasmeena. "Go."</p>

<p>I heard Gotrah fumbling at something, then a slight grating sound.
Consumed by curiosity, I dared open one eye a slit, in time to glimpse Gotrah
disappearing through a black opening that gaped in the middle of the stone
floor, and which closed after him. I quickly shut my eye again and lay still,
listening to Yasmeena's quick pantherish tread back and forth across
the floor.</p>

<p>Once she came and stood over me. I felt her burning gaze and heard her
curse beneath her breath. Then she struck me viciously across the face with
some kind of jeweled ornament that tore my skin and started a trickle of
blood. But I lay without twitching a muscle, and presently she turned and
left the chamber, muttering.</p>

<p>As the door closed behind her I rose quickly, scanning the floor for some
sign of the opening through which Gotrah had gone. A furry rug had been drawn
aside from the center of the floor, but in the polished black stone I
searched in vain for a crevice to denote the hidden trap. I momentarily
expected the return of Yasmeena, and my heart pounded within me. Suddenly,
under my very hand, a section of the floor detached itself and began to move
upward. A pantherish bound carried me behind a tapestried couch, where I
crouched, watching the trap rise upward. The narrow head of Gotrah appeared,
then his winged shoulders and body.</p>

<p>He climbed up into the chamber, and as he turned to lower the lifted trap,
I left the floor with a catlike leap that carried me over the couch and full
on his shoulders.</p>

<p>He went down under my weight, and my gripping fingers crushed the yell in
his throat. With a convulsive heave he twisted under me, and stark horror
flooded his face as he glared up at me. He was down on the cushioned stone,
pinned under my iron bulk. He clawed for the dagger at his girdle, but my
knee pinned it down. And crouching on him, I gutted my mad hate for his
cursed race. I strangled him slowly, gloatingly, avidly watching his features
contort and his eyes glaze. He must have been dead for some minutes before I
loosed my hold.</p>

<p>Rising, I gazed through the open trap. The light from the torches of the
chamber shone down a narrow shaft, into which was cut a series of narrow
steps, that evidently led down into the bowels of the rock Yuthla. From the
conversation I had heard, it must lead to the temple of the Akkas, in the
town below. Surely I would find Akka no harder to escape from than Yugga. Yet
I hesitated, my heart torn at the thought of leaving Altha alone in Yugga.
But there was no other way. I did not know in what part of that devil-city
she was imprisoned, and I remembered what Gotrah had said of the great band
of warriors guarding her and the other virgins.</p>

<p>Virgins of the Moon! Cold sweat broke out on me as the full significance
of the phrase became apparent. Just what the festival of the Moon was I did
not fully know, but I had heard hints and scattered comments among the Yaga
women, and I knew it was a beastly saturnalia, in which the full frenzy of
erotic ecstasy was reached in the dying gasps of the wretches sacrificed to
the only god the winged people recognized&mdash;their own inhuman lust.</p>

<p>The thought of Altha being subjected to such a fate drove me into a
berserk frenzy, and steeled my resolution. There was but one chance&mdash;to
escape myself, and try to reach Koth and bring back enough men to attempt a
rescue. My heart sank as I contemplated the difficulties in the way, but
there was nothing else to be done.</p>

<p>Lifting Gotrah's limp body I dragged it out of the chamber through a
door different from that through which Yasmeena had gone; and traversing a
corridor without meeting anyone, I concealed the corpse behind some
tapestries. I was certain that it would be found, but perhaps not until I had
a good start. Perhaps its presence in another room than the chamber of the
trap might divert suspicion from my actual means of escape, and lead Yasmeena
to think that I was merely hiding somewhere in Yugga.</p>

<p>But I was crowding my luck. I could not long hope to avoid detection if I
lingered. Returning to the chamber, I entered the shaft, lowering the trap
above me. It was pitch-dark, then, but my groping fingers found the catch
that worked the trap, and I felt that I could return if I found my way
blocked below. Down those inky stairs I groped, with an uneasy feeling that I
might fall into some pit or meet with some grisly denizen of the underworld.
But nothing occurred, and at last the steps ceased and I groped my way along
a short corridor that ended at a blank wall. My fingers encountered a metal
catch, and I shot the bolt, feeling a section of the wall revolving under my
hands. I was dazzled by a dim yet lurid light, and blinking, gazed out with
some trepidation.</p>

<p>I was looking into a lofty chamber that was undoubtedly a shrine. My view
was limited by a large screen of carved gold directly in front of me, the
edges of which flamed dully in the weird light.</p>

<p>Gliding from the secret door, I peered around the screen. I saw a broad
room, made with the same stern simplicity and awesome massiveness that
characterized Almuric architecture. The ceiling was lost in the brooding
shadows; the walls were black, dully gleaming, and unadorned. The shrine was
empty except for a block of ebon stone, evidently an altar, on which blazed
the lurid flame I had noted, and which seemed to emanate from a great somber
jewel set upon the altar. I noticed darkly stained channels on the sides of
that altar, and on the dusky stone lay a roll of white
parchment&mdash;Yasmeena's word to her worshippers. I had stumbled into
the Akka holy of holies&mdash;uncovered the very root and base on which the
whole structure of Akka theology was based: the supernatural appearances of
revelations from the goddess, and the appearance of the goddess herself in
the temple. Strange that a whole religion should be based on the ignorance of
the devotees concerning a subterranean stair! Stranger still, to an Earthly
mind, that only the lowest form of humanity on Almuric should possess a
systematic and ritualistic religion, which Earth people regard as sure token
of the highest races!</p>

<p>But the cult of the Akkas was dark and weird. The whole atmosphere of the
shrine was one of mystery and brooding horror. I could imagine the awe of the
blue worshippers to see the winged goddess emerging from behind the golden
screen, like a deity incarnated from cosmic emptiness.</p>

<p>Closing the door behind me, I glided stealthily across the temple. Just
within the door a stocky blue man in a fantastic robe lay snoring lustily on
the naked stone. Presumably he had slept tranquilly through Gotrah's
ghostly visit. I stepped over him as gingerly as a cat treading wet earth,
Gotrah's dagger in my hand, but he did not awaken. An instant later I
stood outside, breathing deep of the river-laden night air.</p>

<p>The temple lay in the shadow of the great cliffs. There was no moon, only
the myriad millions of stars that glimmer in the skies of Almuric. I saw no
lights anywhere in the village, no movement. The sluggish Akkas slept
soundly.</p>

<p>Stealthily as a phantom I stole through the narrow streets, hugging close
to the sides of the squat stone huts. I saw no human until I reached the
wall. The drawbridge that spanned the river was drawn up, and just within the
gate sat a blue man, nodding over his spear. The senses of the Akkas were
dull as those of any beasts of burden. I could have knifed the drowsy
watchman where he sat, but I saw no need of useless murder. He did not hear
me, though I passed within forty feet of him. Silently I glided over the
wall, and silently I slipped into the water.</p>

<p>Striking out strongly, I forged across the easy current, and reached the
farther bank. There I paused only long enough to drink deep of the cold river
water; then I struck out across the shadowed desert at a swinging trot that
eats up miles&mdash;the gait with which the Apaches of my native Southwest
can wear out a horse.</p>

<p>In the darkness before dawn I came to the banks of the Purple River,
skirting wide to avoid the watchtower which jutted dimly against the
star-flecked sky. As I crouched on the steep bank and gazed down into the
rushing swirling current, my heart sank. I knew that, in my fatigued
condition, it was madness to plunge into the maelstrom. The strongest swimmer
that either Earth or Almuric ever bred had been helpless among those eddies
and whirlpools. There was but one thing to be done&mdash;try to reach the
Bridge of Rocks before dawn broke, and take the desperate chance of slipping
across under the eyes of the watchers. That, too, was madness, but I had no
choice.</p>

<p>But dawn began to whiten the desert before I was within a thousand yards
of the Bridge. And looking at the tower, which seemed to swim slowly into
clearer outline, etched against the dim sky, I saw a shape soar up from the
turrets and wing its way toward me. I had been discovered. Instantly, a
desperate plan occurred to me. I began to stagger erratically, ran a few
paces, and sank down in the sand near the river bank. I heard the beat of
wings above me as the suspicious harpy circled; then I knew he was dropping
earthward. He must have been on solitary sentry duty, and had come to
investigate the matter of a lone wanderer, without waking his mates.</p>

<p>Watching through slitted lids, I saw him strike the earth near by, and
walk about me suspiciously, scimitar in hand. At last he pushed me with his
foot, as if to find if I lived. Instantly my arm hooked about his legs,
bringing him down on top of me. A single cry burst from his lips,
half-stifled as my fingers found his throat; then in a great heaving and
fluttering of wings and lashing of limbs, I heaved him over and under me. His
scimitar was useless at such close quarters. I twisted his arm until his
numbed fingers slipped from the hilt; then I choked him into submission.
Before he regained his full faculties, I bound his wrists in front of him
with his girdle, dragged him to his feet, and perched myself astride his
back, my legs locked about his torso. My left arm was hooked about his neck,
my right hand pricked his hide with Gotrah's dagger.</p>

<p>In a few low words I told him what he must do, if he wished to live. It
was not the nature of a Yaga to sacrifice himself, even for the welfare of
his race. Through the rose-pink glow of dawn we soared into the sky, swept
over the rushing Purple River, and vanished from the sight of the land of
Yagg, into the blue mazes of the northwest.</p>
<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="almuric11"
name="almuric11">CHAPTER 11</a></h2>

<p class="first">I DROVE that winged devil unmercifully. Not until sunset did
I allow him to drop earthward. Then I bound his feet and wings so he could
not escape, and gathered fruit and nuts for our meal. I fed him as well as I
fed myself. He needed strength for the flight. That night the beasts of prey
roared perilously close to us, and my captive turned ashy with fright, for we
had no way of making a protecting fire, but none attacked us. We had left the
forest of the Purple River far, far behind, and were among the grasslands. I
was taking the most direct route to Koth, led by the unerring instinct of the
wild. I continually scanned the skies behind me for some sign of pursuit, but
no winged shapes darkened the southern horizon.</p>

<p><br>It was on the fourth day that I spied a dark moving mass in the plains
below, which I believed was an army of men marching. I ordered the Yaga to
fly over them. I knew that I had reached the vicinity of the wide territory
dominated by the city of Koth, and there was a chance that these might be men
of Koth. If so, they were in force, for as we approached I saw there were
several thousand men, marching in some order.</p>

<p>So intense was my interest that it almost proved my undoing. During the
day I left the Yaga's legs unbound, as he swore that he could not fly
otherwise, but I kept his wrists bound. In my engrossment I did not notice
him furtively gnawing at the thong. My dagger was in its sheath, since he had
shown no recent sign of rebellion. My first intimation of revolt was when he
wheeled suddenly sidewise, so that I lurched and almost lost my grip on him.
His long arm curled about my torso and tore at my girdle, and the next
instant my own dagger gleamed in his hand.</p>

<p>There ensued one of the most desperate struggles in which I have ever
participated. My near fall had swung me around, so that instead of being on
his back, I was in front of him, maintaining my position only by one hand
clutching his hair, and one knee crooked about his leg. My other hand was
locked on his dagger wrist, and there we tore and twisted, a thousand feet in
the air, he to break away and let me fall to my death, or to drive home the
dagger in my breast, I to maintain my grip and fend off the gleaming
blade.</p>

<p>On the ground my superior weight and strength would quickly have settled
the issue, but in the air he had the advantage. His free hand beat and tore
at my face, while his unimprisoned knee drove viciously again and again for
my groin. I hung grimly on, taking the punishment without flinching, seeing
that our struggles were dragging us lower and lower toward the earth.</p>

<p>Realizing this, he made a final desperate effort. Shifting the dagger to
his free hand, he stabbed furiously at my throat. At the same instant I gave
his head a terrific downward wrench. The impetus of both our exertions
whirled us down and over, and his stroke, thrown out of line by our erratic
convulsion, missed its mark and sheathed the dagger in his own thigh. A
terrible cry burst from his lips, his grasp went limp as he half fainted from
the pain and shock, and we rushed plummetlike earthward. I strove to turn him
beneath me, and even as I did, we struck the earth with a terrific
concussion.</p>

<p>From that impact I reeled up dizzily. The Yaga did not move; his body had
cushioned mine, and half the bones in his frame must have been
splintered.</p>

<p>A clamor of voices rang on my ears, and turning, I saw a horde of hairy
figures rushing toward me. I heard my own name bellowed by a thousand
tongues. I had found the men of Koth.</p>

<p>A hairy giant was alternately pumping my hand and beating me on the back
with blows that would have staggered a horse, while bellowing:
"Ironhand! By Thak's jawbones, <i>Ironhand</i>! Grip my hand, old
war-dog! Hell's thunders, I've known no such joyful hour since
the day I broke old Khush of Tanga's back!"</p>

<p>There was old Khossuth Skullsplitter, somber as ever, Thab the Swift,
Gutchluk Tigerwrath&mdash;nearly all the mighty men of Koth. And the way they
smote my back and roared their welcome warmed my heart as it was never warmed
on Earth, for I knew there was no room for insincerity in their great simple
hearts.</p>

<p>"Where have you been, Ironhand?" exclaimed Thab the Swift.
"We found your broken carbine out on the plains, and a Yaga lying near
it with his skull smashed; so we concluded that you had been done away with
by those winged devils. But we never found your body&mdash;and now you come
tumbling through the skies locked in combat with another flying fiend! Say,
have you been to Yugga?" He laughed as a man laughs when he speaks a
jest.</p>

<p>"Aye to Yugga, on the rock Yuthla, by the river Yogh, in the land of
Yagg," I answered. "Where is Zal the Thrower?"</p>

<p>"He guards the city with the thousand we left behind,"
answered Khossuth.</p>

<p>"His daughter languishes in the Black City," I said. "On
the night of the full moon, Altha, Zal's daughter, dies with five
hundred other girls of the Guras&mdash;unless we prevent it."</p>

<p>A murmur of wrath and horror swept along the ranks. I glanced over the
savage array. There were a good four thousand of them; no bows were in
evidence, but each man bore his carbine. That meant war, and their numbers
proved it was no minor raid.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The men of Khor move against us, five thousand strong,"
answered Khossuth. "It is the death grapple of the tribes. We march to
meet them afar off from our walls, and spare our women the horrors of the
war."</p>

<p>"Forget the men of Khor!" I cried passionately. "You
would spare the feelings of your women&mdash;yet thousands of your women
suffer the tortures of the damned on the ebon rock of Yuthla! Follow me! I
will lead you to the stronghold of the devils who have harried Almuric for a
thousand ages!"</p>

<p>"How many warriors?" asked Khossuth uncertainly.</p>

<p>"Twenty thousand."</p>

<p>A groan rose from the listeners.</p>

<p>"What could our handful do against that horde?"</p>

<p>"I'll show you!" I exclaimed. "I'll lead you
into the heart of their citadel!"</p>

<p>"<i>Hai!</i>" roared Ghor the Bear, brandishing his broadsword,
always quick to take fire from my suggestions. "That's the word!
Come on, sir brothers! Follow Ironhand! He'll show us the
way!"</p>

<p>"But what of the men of Khor?" expostulated Khossuth.
"They are marching to attack us. We must meet them."</p>

<p>Ghor grunted explosively as the truth of this assertion came home to him
and all eyes turned toward me.</p>

<p>"Leave them to me," I proposed desperately. "Let me talk
with them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They'll hack off your head before you can open your
mouth," grunted Khossuth.</p>

<p>"That's right," admitted Ghor. "We've been
fighting the men of Khor for fifty thousand years. Don't trust them,
comrade."</p>

<p>"I'll take the chance," I answered.</p>

<p>"The chance you shall have, then," said Gutchluk grimly.
"For there they come!" In the distance we saw a dark moving
mass.</p>

<p>"Carbines ready!" barked old Khossuth, his cold eyes gleaming.
"Loosen your blades, and follow me."</p>

<p>"Will you join battle tonight?" I asked.

<p>He glanced at the
sun. "No. We'll march to meet them, and pitch camp just out of
gunshot. Then with dawn we'll rush them and cut their
throats."</p>

<p>"They'll have the same idea," explained Thab. "Oh,
it will be great fun!"</p>

<p>"And while you revel in senseless bloodshed," I answered
bitterly, "your daughters and theirs will be screaming vainly under the
tortures of the winged people over the river Yogh. Fools! Oh, you
fools!"</p>

<p>"But what can we do?" expostulated Gutchluk.</p>

<p>"Follow me!" I yelled passionately. "We'll march
to meet them, and I'll go on to them alone."</p>

<p>I wheeled and strode across the plain, and the hairy men of Koth fell in
behind me, with many headshakes and mutterings. I saw the oncoming mass,
first as a mingled blur; then the details stood out&mdash;hairy bodies,
fierce faces, gleaming weapons&mdash;but I swung on heedlessly. I knew
neither fear nor caution; my whole being seemed on fire with the urgency of
my need and desire.</p>

<p>Several hundred yards separated the two hosts when I dashed down my single
weapon&mdash;the Yaga dagger&mdash;and shaking off Ghor's protesting
hands, advanced alone and unarmed, my hands in the air; palms toward the
enemy.</p>

<p>These had halted, drawn up ready for action. The unusualness of my actions
and appearance puzzled them. I momentarily expected the crack of a carbine,
but nothing happened until I was within a few yards of the foremost group,
the mightiest men clustered about a tall figure that was their
chief&mdash;old Bragi, Khossuth had told me. I had heard of him, a hard,
cruel man, moody and fanatical in his hatreds.</p>

<p>"Stand!" he shouted, lifting his sword. "What trick is
this? Who are you who comes with empty hands in the teeth of war?"</p>

<p>"I am Esau Ironhand, of the tribe of Koth," I answered.
"I would parley with you."</p>

<p>"What madman is this?" growled Bragi. "Than&mdash;a
bullet through his head."</p>

<p>But the man called Than, who had been staring eagerly at me, gave a shout
instead and threw down his carbine.</p>

<p>"Not if I live!" he exclaimed, advancing toward me his arms
outstretched. "By Thak, it is he! Do you not remember me, Than
Swordswinger, whose life you saved in the hills?"</p>

<p>He lifted his chin to display a great scar on his corded neck.</p>

<p>"You are he who fought the sabertooth! I had not dreamed you
survived those awful wounds."</p>

<p>"We men of Khor are hard to kill!" he laughed joyously,
throwing his arms about me in a bearlike embrace. "What are you doing
among the dogs of Koth? You should be fighting with us!"</p>

<p>"If I have my way there will be no fighting," I answered.
"I wish only to talk with your chiefs and warriors. There is nothing
out of the way about that."</p>

<p>"True!" agreed Than Swordswinger. "Bragi, you will not
refuse him this?"</p>

<p>Bragi growled in his beard, glaring at me.</p>

<p>"Let your warriors advance to that spot." I indicated the
place I meant. "Khossuth's men will come up on the other side.
There both hordes will listen to what I have to say. Then, if no agreement
can be reached, each side shall withdraw five hundred yards and after that
follow its own initiative."</p>

<p>"You are mad!" Old Bragi jerked his beard with a shaking hand
of rage. "It is treachery. Back to your kennel, dog!"</p>

<p>"I am your hostage," I answered. "I am unarmed. I will
not move out of your sword reach. If there is treachery, strike me down on
the spot."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"I have been captive among the Yagas!" I exclaimed. "I
have come to tell the Guras what things occur in the land of Yagg!"</p>

<p>"The Yagas took my daughter!" exclaimed a warrior, pushing
through the ranks. "Did you see her in Yagg?"</p>

<p>"They took my sister!"&mdash;"And my young
bride"&mdash;"And my niece!" shouts rose in chorus, as men
swarmed about me, forgetful of their enemies, shaking me in the intensity of
their feeling.</p>

<p>"Back, you fools!" roared Bragi, smiting with the flat of his
sword. "Will you break your ranks and let the Kothans cut you down? Do
you not see it is a trick?"</p>

<p>"It is no trick!" I cried. "Only listen to me, in
God's name!"</p>

<p>They swept away Bragi's protests. There was a milling and stamping,
during which only a kindly Providence kept the nerve-taut Kothans from
pouring a volley into the surging mass of their enemies, and presently a sort
of order was evolved. A shouted conference finally resulted in approximately
the position I had asked for&mdash;a semicircle of Khorans over against a
similar formation composed of Kothans. The close proximity almost caused the
tribal wrath to boil over. Jaws jutted, eyes blazed, hairy hands clutched
convulsively at carbine stocks. Like wild dogs those wild men glared at each
other, and I hastened to begin my say.</p>

<p><br>I was never much of a talker, and as I strode between those hostile hordes
I felt my fire die out in cold ague of helplessness. A million ages of
traditional war and feud rose up to confound me. One man against the
accumulated ideas, inhibitions, and customs of a whole world, built up
through countless millenniums&mdash;the thought crushed and paralyzed me.
Then blind rage swept me at the memory of the horrors of Yugga, and the fire
blazed up again and enveloped the world and made it small, and on the wings
of that conflagration I was borne to heights of which I had never
dreamed.</p>

<p>No need for fiery oratory to tell the tale I had to tell. I told it in the
plainest, bluntest language possible, and the knowledge and feeling that lay
behind the telling made those naked words pulse, and burn like acid.</p>

<p>I told of the hell that was Yugga. I told of young girls dying beneath the
excesses of black demons&mdash;of women lashed to gory ribbons, mangled on
the wheel, sundered on the rack, flayed alive, dismembered alive&mdash;of the
torments that left the body unharmed, but sucked the mind empty of reason and
left the victim a blind, mewing imbecile. I told them&mdash;oh God, I cannot
repeat all I told them, at the memory of which I am even now sickened almost
unto death.</p>

<p>Before I had finished, men were bellowing and beating their breasts with
their clenched fists, and weeping in agony of grief and fury.</p>

<p>I lashed them with a last whip of scorpions. "These are your women,
your own flesh and blood, who scream on the racks of Yugga! You call
yourselves men&mdash;you strut and boast and swagger, while these winged
devils mock you. Men! Ha!" I laughed as a wolf barks, from the depths
of my bitter rage, and agony. "Men! Go home and don the skirts of
women!"</p>

<p>A terrible yell arose. Clenched fists were brandished, bloodshot eyes
flamed at me, hairy throats bayed their anguished fury. "You lie, you
dog! Damn you, you lie! We <i>are</i> men! Lead us against these devils or we
will rend you!"</p>

<p>"If you follow me," I yelled, "few of you will return.
You will suffer and you will die in hordes. But if you had seen what I have
seen, you would not wish to live. Soon approaches the time when the Yagas
will clean their house. They are weary of their slaves. They will destroy
those they have, and fare forth into the world for more. I have told you of
the destruction of Thugra. So it will be with Khor; so it will be with
Koth&mdash;when winged devils swoop out of the night. Follow me to
Yugga&mdash;I will show you the way. If you are men, follow me!"</p>

<p>Blood burst from my lips in the intensity of my appeal, and as I reeled
back, in a state of complete collapse from overwrought nerves and strain,
Ghor caught me in his mighty arms.</p>

<p>Khossuth rose like a gaunt ghost. His ghostly voice soared out across the
tumult.</p>

<p>"I will follow Esau Ironhand to Yugga, if the men of Khor will agree
to a truce until our return. What is your answer, Bragi?"</p>

<p>"<i>No!</i>" roared Bragi. "There can be no peace between Khor
and Koth. The women in Yugga are lost. Who can war against demons? Up, men,
back to your place! No man can twist me with mad words to forget old
hates."</p>

<p>He lifted his sword, and Than Swordswinger, tears of grief and fury
running down his face, jerked out his poniard and drove it to the hilt in the
heart of his king. Wheeling to the bewildered horde, brandishing the bloody
dagger, his body shaken with sobs of frenzy, he yelled:</p>

<p>"So die all who would make us traitors to our own women! Draw your
swords, all men of Khor who will follow me to Yugga!"</p>

<p>Five thousand swords flamed in the sun, and a deep-throated thunderous
roar shook the very sky. Then wheeling to me, his eyes coals of madness:</p>

<p>"Lead us to Yugga, Esau Ironhand!" cried Than Swordswinger.
"Lead us to Yagg, or lead us to Hell! We will stain the waters of Yogh
with blood, and the Yagas will speak of us with shudders for ten thousand
times a thousand years!"</p>

<p>Again the clangor of swords and the roar of frenzied men maddened the
sky.</p>

<h2><a id="almuric12"
name="almuric12">CHAPTER 12</a></h2>

<p class="first">RUNNERS WERE SENT to the cities, to give word of what went
forward. Southward we marched, four thousand men of Koth, five thousand of
Khor. We moved in separate columns, for I deemed it wise to keep the tribes
apart until the sight of their oppressors should again drown tribal
feelings.</p>

<p>Our pace was much swifter than that of an equal body of Earth soldiers. We
had no supply trains. We lived off the land through which we passed. Each man
bore his own armament&mdash;carbine, sword, dagger, canteen, and ammunition
pouch. But I chafed at every mile. Sailing through the air on the back of a
captive Yaga had spoiled me for marching. It took us days to cover ground the
flying men had passed over in hours. Yet we progressed, and some three weeks
from the time we began the march, we entered the forest beyond which lay the
Purple River and the desert that borders the land of Yagg.</p>

<p>We had seen no Yagas, but we went cautiously now. Leaving the bulk of our
force encamped deep in the forest, I went forward with thirty men, timing our
march so that we reached the bank of the Purple River a short time after
midnight, just before the setting of the Moon. My purpose was to find a way
to prevent the tower guard from carrying the news of our coming to Yugga, so
that we might cross the desert without being attacked in the open, where the
numbers and tactics of the Yagas would weigh most heavily against us.</p>

<p>Khossuth suggested that we lie in wait among the trees along the bank, and
pick the watchers off at long range at dawn, but this I knew to be
impossible. There was no cover along the water's edge, and the river
lay between. The men in the tower were out of our range. We might creep near
enough to pick off one or two, but it was imperative that all should perish,
since the escape of one would be enough to ruin our plans.</p>

<p>So we stole through the woods until we reached a point a mile upstream,
opposite a jutting tongue of rock, toward which, I believed, a current set in
from the center of the stream. There we placed in the water a heavy, strong
catamaran we had constructed, with a long powerful rope. I got upon the craft
with four of the best marksmen of the combined horde&mdash;Thab the Swift,
Skel the Hawk, and two warriors of Khor. Each of us bore two carbines,
strapped to our backs.</p>

<p>We bent to work with crude oars, though our efforts seemed ludicrously
futile in the teeth of that flood. But the raft was long enough and heavy
enough not to be spun by every whirlpool we crossed, and by dint of herculean
effort we worked out toward the middle of the stream. The men on shore paid
out the rope, and it acted as a sort of brace, swinging us around in a wide
arc that would have eventually brought us back to the bank we had left, had
not the current we hoped for suddenly caught us and hurled us at dizzy speed
toward the projecting tongue of rock. The raft reeled and pitched, driving
its nose under repeatedly, until sometimes we were fully submerged. But our
ammunition was waterproof, and we had lashed ourselves to the logs; so we
hung on like drowned rats, until our craft was dashed against the rocky
point.</p>

<p>It hung there for a breathless instant, in which time it was touch and go.
We slashed ourselves loose, jumped into the water which swirled arm-pit deep
about us, and fought our way along the point, clinging tooth and nail to
every niche or projection, while the foaming current threatened momentarily
to tear us away and send us after our raft which had slid off the ledge and
was dancing away down the river.</p>

<p>We did make it, though, and hauled ourselves upon the shore at last, half
dead from buffeting and exhaustion But we could not stop to rest, for the
most delicate part of our scheme was before us. It was necessary that we
should not be discovered before dawn gave us light enough to see the sights
of our carbines, for the best marksman in the world is erratic by starlight.
But I trusted to the chance that the Yagas would be watching the river, and
paying scant heed to the desert behind them.</p>

<p>So in the darkness that precedes dawn, we stole around in a wide circle,
and the first hint of light found us lying in a depression we had scraped in
the sand not over four hundred yards to the south of the tower.</p>

<p>It was tense waiting, while the dawn lifted slowly over the land, and
objects became more and more distinct. The roar of the water over the Bridge
of Rocks reached us plainly, and at last we were aware of another sound. The
clash of steel reached us faintly through the water tumult. Ghor and others
were advancing to the river bank, according to my instructions. We could not
see any Yagas on the tower; only hints of movement along the turrets. But
suddenly one whirled up into the morning sky and started south at headlong
speed. Skel's carbine cracked and the winged man, with a loud cry,
pitched sideways and tumbled to earth.</p>

<p>There followed an instant of silence; then five winged shapes darted into
the air, soaring high. The Yagas sensed what was occurring, and were chancing
all on a desperate rush, hoping that at least one might get through. We all
fired, but I scored a complete miss, and Thab only slightly wounded his man.
But the others brought down the man I had missed, while Thab's second
shot dropped the wounded Yaga. We reloaded hastily, but no more came from the
tower. Six men watched there, Yasmeena had said. She had spoken the
truth.</p>

<p>We cast the bodies into the river. I crossed the Bridge of Rocks, leaping
from boulder to boulder, and told Ghor to take his men back into the forest,
and to bring up the host. They were to camp just within the fringe of woods,
out of sight from the sky. I did not intend to start across the desert until
nightfall.</p>

<p>Then I returned to the tower and attempted to gain entrance, but found no
doors, only a few small barred windows. The Yagas had entered it from the
top. It was too tall and smooth to be climbed, so we did the only thing left
to do. We dug pits in the sand and covered them with branches, over which we
scattered dust. In these pits we concealed our best marksmen, who lay all
day, patiently scanning the sky. Only one Yaga came winging across the
desert. No human was in sight, and he was not suspicious until he poised
directly over the tower. Then, when he saw no watchmen, he became alarmed,
but before he could race away, the reports of half a dozen carbines brought
him tumbling to the earth in a whirl of limbs and wings.</p>

<p>As the sun sank, we brought the warriors across the Bridge of Rocks, an
accomplishment which required some time. But at last they all stood on the
Yaga side of the river, and with our canteens well filled, we started at
quick pace across the narrow desert. Before dawn we were within striking
distance of the river.</p>

<p>Having crossed the desert under cover of darkness, I was not surprised
that we were able to approach the river without being discovered. If any had
been watching from the citadel, alert for anything suspicious, they would
have discerned our dark mass moving across the sands under the dim starlight.
But I knew that in Yugga no such watch was ever kept, secure as the winged
people felt in the protection of the Purple River, of the watchmen in the
tower, and of the fact that for centuries no Gura raid had dared the bloody
doom of former invaders. Nights were spent in frenzied debauchery, followed
by sodden sleep. As for the men of Akka, these slow-witted drudges were too
habitually drowsy to constitute much menace against our approach, though I
knew that once roused they would fight like animals.</p>

<p>So three hundred yards from the river we halted, and eight thousand men
under Khossuth took cover in the irrigation ditches that traversed the fields
of fruit. The waving fronds of the squat trees likewise aided in their
concealment. This was done in almost complete silence. Far above us towered
the somber rock Yuthla. A faint breeze sprang up, forerunner of dawn. I led
the remaining thousand warriors toward the river bank. Halting them a short
distance from it, I wriggled forward on my belly until my hands were at the
water's edge. I thanked the Fates that had given me such men to lead.
Where civilized men would have floundered and blundered, the Guras moved as
easily and noiselessly as stalking panthers.</p>

<p>Across from me rose the wall, sheer from the steep bank, that guarded
Akka. It would be hard to climb in the teeth of spears. At the first crack of
dawn, the bridge, which towered gauntly against the stars, would be lowered
so that Akkas might go into the fields to work. But before then the rising
light would betray our forces.</p>

<p>With a word to Ghor, who lay at my side, I slid into the water and struck
out for the farther shore, he following. Reaching a point directly below the
bridge, we hung in the water, clutching the slippery wall, and looked about
for some way of climbing it. There the water, near the bank, was almost as
deep as in midstream. At last Ghor found a crevice in the masonry, wide
enough to give him a grip for his hands. Then bracing himself, he held fast
while I clambered on his shoulders. Standing thus I managed to reach the
lower part of the lifted bridge, and an instant later I drew myself up. The
erected bridge closed the gap in the wall. I had to clamber over the barrier.
One leg was across, when a figure sprang out of the shadows, yelling a
warning. The watchman had not been as drowsy as I had expected.</p>

<p>He leaped at me, the starlight glinting on his spear. With a desperate
twist of my body, I avoided the whistling blade, though the effort almost
toppled me from the wall. My out-thrown hand gripped his lank hair as he fell
against the coping with the fury of his wasted thrust, and jerking myself
back into balance, I dealt him a crushing buffet on the ear with my clenched
fist. He crumpled, and the next instant I was over the wall.</p>

<p>Ghor was bellowing like a bull in the river, mad to know what was taking
place above him, and in the dim light the Akkas were swarming like bees out
of their stony hives. Leaning over the barrier I stretched Ghor the shaft of
the watchman's spear, and he came heaving and scrambling up beside me.
The Akkas had stared stupidly for an instant; then realizing they were being
invaded, they rushed, howling madly.</p>

<p>As Ghor sprang to meet them, I leaped to the great windlass that
controlled the bridge. I heard the Bear's thunderous war cry boom above
the squalling of the Akkas, the strident clash of steel and the crunch of
splintered bone. But I had no time to look; it was taking all my strength to
work the windlass. I had seen five Akkas toiling together at it; yet in the
stress of the moment I accomplished its lowering single-handed, though sweat
burst out on my forehead and my muscles trembled with the effort. But down it
came, and the farther end touched the other bank in time to accommodate the
feet of the warriors who sprang up and rushed for it.</p>

<p>I wheeled to aid Ghor, whose panting gasps I still heard amidst the clamor
of the melee. I knew the din in the lower town would soon rouse the Yagas and
it was imperative that we gain a foothold in Akka before the shafts of the
winged men began to rain among us.</p>

<p>Ghor was hard pressed when I turned from the bridge-head. Half a dozen
corpses lay under his feet, and he wielded his great sword with a berserk
lustiness that sheared through flesh and bone like butter, but he was
streaming blood, and the Akkas were closing in on him.</p>

<p>I had no weapon but Gotrah's dagger, but I sprang into the fray and
ripped a sword from the sinking hand of one whose heart my slim blade found.
It was a crude weapon, such as the Akkas forge, but it had edge and weight,
and swinging it like a club, I wrought havoc among the swarming blue men.
Ghor greeted my arrival with a gasping roar of pleasure, and redoubled the
fury of his tremendous strokes, so that the dazed Akkas momentarily gave
back.</p>

<p>And in that fleeting interval, the first of the Guras swarmed across the
bridge. In an instant fifty men had joined us. But there the matter was
deadlocked. Swarm after swarm of blue men rushed from their huts to fall on
us with reckless fury. One Gura was a match for three or four Akkas, but they
swamped us by numbers. They crushed us back into the bridge mouth, and strive
as we could, we could not advance enough to clear the way for the hundreds of
warriors behind us who yelled and struggled to come to sword-strokes with the
enemy. The Akkas pressed in on us in a great crescent, almost crushing us
against the men behind us. They lined the walls, yelling and screaming and
brandishing their weapons. There were no bows or missiles among them; their
winged masters were careful to keep such things out of their hands.</p>

<p>In the midst of the carnage dawn broke, and the struggling hordes saw
their enemies. Above us, I knew, the Yagas would be stirring. Indeed I
thought I could already hear the thrash of wings above the roar of battle,
but I could not look up. Breast to breast we were locked with the heaving,
grunting hordes, so closely there was no room for sword-strokes. Their teeth
and filthy nails tore at us beastlike; their repulsive body odor was in our
nostrils. In the crush we writhed and cursed, each man striving to free a
hand to strike.</p>

<p>My flesh crawled in dread of the arrows I knew must soon be raining from
above, and even with the thought the first volley came like a whistling sheet
of sleet. At my side and behind me men cried out, clutching at the feathered
ends protruding from their bodies. But then the men on the bridge and on the
farther bank, who had held their fire for fear of hitting their comrades in
the uncertain light, began loosing their carbines at the Akkas. At that range
their fire was devastating. The first volley cleared the wall, and climbing
on the bridge rails the carbineers poured a withering fusillade over our
heads into the close-massed horde that barred our way. The result was
appalling. Great gaps were torn in the struggling mob, and the whole horde
staggered and tore apart. Unsupported by the mass behind, the front ranks
caved in, and over their mangled bodies we rushed into the narrow streets of
Akka.</p>

<p>Opposition was not at an end. The stocky blue men still fought back. Up
and down the streets sounded the clash of steel, crack of shots, and yells of
pain and fury. But our greatest peril was from above.</p>

<p>The winged men were swarming out of their citadel like hornets out of a
nest. Several hundred of them dropped swiftly down into Akka, swords in their
hands, while others lined the rim of the cliff and poured down showers of
arrows. Now the warriors hidden in the shrub-masked ditches opened fire, and
as that volley thundered, a rain of mangled forms fell on the flat roofs of
Akka. The survivors wheeled and raced back to cover as swiftly as their wings
could carry them.</p>

<p>But they were more deadly in defense than in attack. From every casement,
tower and battlement above they rained their arrows; a hail of death showered
Akka, striking down foe and serf alike. Guras and Akkas took refuge in the
stone-roofed huts, where the battling continued in the low-ceilinged chambers
until the gutters of Akka ran red. Four thousand Guras battled four times
their number of Akkas, but the size, ferocity and superior weapons of the
apemen balanced the advantage of numbers.</p>

<p>Across the river Khossuth's carbineers kept up an incessant fire at
the towers of Yugga, but with scant avail. The Yagas kept well covered, and
their arrows, arching down from the sky, had a greater range and accuracy
than the carbines of the Guras. But for their position among the ditches,
Khossuth's men would have been wiped out in short order, and as it was,
they suffered terribly. They could not join us in Akka; it would have been
madness to try to cross the bridge in the teeth of that fire.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I ran straight for the temple of Yasmeena, cutting down those
who stood in my way. I had discarded the clumsy Akka sword for a fine blade
dropped by a slain Gura, and with this in my hand I cut my way through a
swarm of blue spearmen who made a determined stand before the temple. With me
were Ghor, Thab the Swift, Than Swordswinger and a hundred other picked
warriors.</p>

<p>As the last of our foes were trampled under foot, I sprang up the black
stone steps to the massive door, where the bizarre figure of the Akka priest
barred my way with shield and spear. I parried his spear and feinted a thrust
at his thigh. He lowered the great gold-scrolled shield, and before he could
lift it again I slashed off his head, which rolled grinning down the steps. I
caught up the shield as I rushed into the temple.</p>

<p>I rushed across the temple and tore aside the golden screen. My men
crowded in behind me, panting, blood-stained, their fierce faces lighted by
the weird flame from the altar jewel. Fumbling in my haste, I found and
worked the secret catch. The door began to give, reluctantly. It was this
reluctance which fired my brain with sudden suspicion, as I remembered how
easily it had opened before. Even with the thought I yelled,
"Back!" and hurled myself backward as the door gaped
suddenly.</p>

<p>Instantly my ears were deafened by an awful roar, my eyes blinded by a
terrible flash. Something like a spurt of hell's fire passed so close
by me it seared my hair in passing. Only my recoil, which carried me behind
the opening door, saved me from the torrent of liquid fire which flooded the
temple from the secret shaft.</p>

<p>There was a blind chaotic instant of frenzy, shot through with awful
screams. Then through the din I heard Ghor loudly bellowing my name, and saw
him stumbling blindly through the whirling smoke, his beard and bristling
hair burned crisp. As the lurid murk cleared somewhat, I saw the remnants of
my band&mdash;Ghor, Thab and a few others who by quickness or luck had
escaped. Than Swordswinger had been directly behind me, and was knocked out
of harm's way when I leaped back. But on the blackened floor of the
temple lay three-score shriveled forms, burned and charred out of all human
recognition. They had been directly in the path of that devouring sheet of
flame as it rushed to dissipate itself in the outer air.</p>

<p>The shaft seemed empty now. Fool to think that Yasmeena would leave it
unguarded, when she must have suspected that I escaped by that route. On the
edges of the door and the jamb I found bits of stuff like wax. Some
mysterious element had been sealed into the shaft which the opening of the
door ignited, sending it toward the outer air in a rush of flame.</p>

<p>I knew the upper trap would be made fast. I shouted for Thab to find and
light a torch, and for Ghor to procure a heavy beam for a ram. Then, telling
Than to gather all the men he could find in the streets and follow, I raced
up the stair in the blackness. As I thought, I found the upper trap
fastened&mdash;bolted above, I suspected; and listening closely, I caught a
confused mumbling above my head, and knew the chamber must be filled with
Yagas.</p>

<p>An erratic flame bobbing below me drew my attention, and quickly Thab
reached my side with a torch. He was followed by Ghor and a score of others,
grunting under the weight of a heavy loglike beam, torn from some Akka hut.
He reported that fighting was still going on in the streets and buildings,
but that most of the Akka males had been put to the sword, and others, with
their women and children, had leaped into the river and swum for the south
shore. He said some five hundred swordsmen were thronging the temple.</p>

<p>"Then burst this trap above our heads," I exclaimed,
"and follow me through. We must win our way into the heart of the hold,
before the arrows of the Yagas on the tower overwhelm Khossuth."</p>

<p>It was difficult in that narrow shaft, where only one man could stand on
each step, but gripping the heavy beam like a ram, we swung it and dashed it
against the trap. The thunder of the blows filled the shaft deafeningly, the
jarring impact stung our hands and quivered the wood, but the trap held.
Again&mdash;and again&mdash;panting, grunting, thews cracking, we swung the
beam&mdash;and with a final terrific drive of hard-braced knotty legs and
iron shoulders, the trap gave with a splintering crash, and light flooded the
shaft.</p>

<p>With a wordless yell I heaved up through the splinters of the trap, the
gold shield held above my head. A score of swords descended on it, staggering
me; but desperately keeping my feet, I heaved up through a veritable rain of
shattering blades, and burst into the chamber of Yasmeena. With a yell the
Yagas swarmed on me, and I cast the bent and shattered shield in their faces,
and swung my sword in a wheel that flashed through breasts and throats like
a mowing blade through corn. I should have died there, but from the opening
behind me crashed a dozen carbines, and the winged men went down in
heaps.</p>

<p>Then up into the chamber came Ghor the Bear, bellowing and terrible, and
after him the killers of Khor and of Koth, thirsting for blood.</p>

<p>That chamber was full of Yagas, and so were the adjoining rooms and
corridors. But in a compact circle, back to back, we held the shaft entrance,
while scores of warriors swarmed up the stair to join us, widening and
pushing out the rim of the circle. In that comparatively small chamber the
din was deafening and terrifying&mdash;the clang of swords, the yelling, the
butcher's sound of flesh and bones parting beneath the chopping
edge.</p>

<p>We quickly cleared the chamber, and held the doors against attack. As more
and more men came up from below, we advanced into the adjoining rooms, and
after perhaps a half-hour of desperate fighting, we held a circle of chambers
and corridors, like a wheel of which the chamber of the shaft was the axle,
and more and more Yagas were leaving the turrets to take part in the
hand-to-hand fighting. There were some three thousand of us in the upper
chambers now, and no more came up the shaft. I sent Thab to tell Khossuth to
bring his men across the river.</p>

<p>I believed that most of the Yagas had left the turrets. They were massed
thick in the chambers and corridors ahead of us, and were fighting like
demons. I have mentioned that their courage was not of the type of the
Guras', but any race will fight when a foe has invaded its last
stronghold, and these winged devils were no weaklings.</p>

<p>For a time the battle was at a gasping deadlock. We could advance no
farther in any direction, nor could they thrust us back. The doorways through
which we slashed and thrust were heaped high with bodies, both hairy and
black. Our ammunition was exhausted, and the Yagas could use their bows to no
advantage. It was hand to hand and sword to sword, men stumbling among the
dead to come to hand grips.</p>

<p>Then, just when it seemed that flesh and blood could stand no more, a
thunderous roar rose to the vaulted ceilings, and up through the shaft and
out through the chambers poured streams of fresh, eager warriors to take our
places. Old Khossuth and his men, maddened to frenzy by the arrows that had
been showering upon them as they lay partly hidden in the ditches, foamed
like rabid dogs to come to hand grips and glut their fury. Thab was not with
them, and Khossuth said he had been struck down by an arrow in his leg, as he
was following his king across the bridge in that dash from the ditches to the
temple. There had been few losses in that reckless rush, however; as I had
suspected, most of the Yagas had entered the chambers, leaving only a few
archers on the towers.</p>

<p>Now began the most bloody and desperate melee I have ever witnessed. Under
the impact of the fresh forces, the weary Yagas gave way, and the battle
streamed out through the halls and rooms. The chiefs tried in vain to keep
the maddened Guras together. Struggling groups split off the main body, men
ran singly down twisting corridors. Throughout all the citadel thundered the
rush of trampling feet, shouts, and din of steel.</p>

<p>Few shots were fired, few arrows winged. It was hand to hand with a
vengeance. In the roofed chambers and halls, the Yagas could not spread their
wings and dart down on their foes from above. They were forced to stand on
their feet, meeting their ancient enemies on even terms. It was out on the
rooftops and the open courts that our losses were greatest, for in the open
the winged men could resort to their accustomed tactics.</p>

<p>But we avoided such places as much as possible, and man to man, the Guras
were invincible. Oh, they died by scores, but under their lashing swords the
Yagas died by hundreds. A thousand ages of cruelty and oppression were being
repaid, and red was the payment. The sword was blind; Yaga women as well as
men fell beneath it. But knowing the fiendishness of those sleek black
females, I could not pity them.</p>

<p>I was looking for Altha.</p>

<p><br>Slaves there were, thousands of them, dazed by the battle, cowering in
terror, too bewildered to realize its portent, or to recognize their
rescuers. Yet several times I saw a woman cry out in sudden joy and run
forward to throw her arms about the bull-neck of some hairy, panting
swordsman, as she recognized a brother, husband, or father. In the midst of
agony and travail there was joy and reuniting, and it warmed my heart to see
it. Only the little yellow slaves and the red woman crouched in terror, as
fearful of these roaring hairy giants as of their winged masters.</p>

<p>Hacking and slashing my way through the knots of struggling warriors, I
sought for the chamber where were imprisoned the Virgins of the Moon. At last
I caught the shoulder of a Gura girl, cowering on the floor to avoid chance
blows of the men battling above her, and shouted a question in her ear. She
understood and pointed, unable to make herself heard above the din. Catching
her up under one arm, I slashed a path for us, and in a chamber beyond I set
her down, and she ran swiftly down a corridor, crying for me to follow. I
raced after her, down that corridor, up a winding stair, across a roof-garden
where Guras and Yagas fought, and finally she halted in an open court. It was
the highest point of the city, besides the minarets. In the midst rose the
dome of the Moon, and at the foot of the dome she showed me a chamber. The
door was locked, but I shattered it with blows of my sword, and glared in. In
the semidarkness I saw the gleam of white limbs huddled close together
against the opposite wall. As my eyes became accustomed to the dimness I saw
that some hundred and fifty girls were cowering in terror against the wall.
And as I called Altha's name, I heard a voice cry, "Esau! Oh,
<i>Esau!</i>" and a slim white figure hurled itself across the chamber to
throw white arms about my neck and rain passionate kisses on my bronzed
features. For an instant I crushed her close, returning her kisses with
hungry lips; then the roar of battle outside roused me. Turning I saw a swarm
of Yagas, pressed close by five hundred swords, being forced out of a great
doorway near by. Abandoning the fray suddenly they took to flight, their
assailants flowing out into the court with yells of triumph.</p>

<p>And then before me I heard a light mocking laugh, and saw the lithe figure
of Yasmeena, Queen of Yagg.</p>

<p>"So you have returned, Ironhand?" Her voice was like poisoned
honey. "You have returned with your slayers to break the reign of the
gods? Yet you have not conquered, oh fool."</p>

<p>Without a word I drove at her, silently and murderously, but she sprang
lightly into the air, avoiding my thrust. Her laughter rose to an insane
scream.</p>

<p>"Fool!" she shrieked. "You have not conquered! Did I not
say I would perish in the ruins of my kingdom? Dogs, you are all dead
men!"</p>

<p>Whirling in midair she rushed with appalling speed straight for the dome.
The Yagas seemed to sense her intention, for they cried out in horror and
protest, but she did not pause. Lighting on the smooth slope of the dome,
keeping her perch by the use of her wings, she turned, shook a hand at us in
mockery, and then, gripping some bolt or handle set in the dome, braced both
her feet against the ivory slope and pulled with all her strength.</p>

<p>A section of the dome gave way, catapulting her into the air. The next
instant a huge misshapen bulk came rushing from the opening. And as it
rushed, the impact of its body against the edges of the door was like the
crash of a thunderbolt. The dome split in a hundred places from base to
pinnacle, and fell in with a thunderous roar. Through a cloud of dust and
debris and falling stone the huge figure burst into the open. A yell went up
from the watchers.</p>

<p>The thing that had emerged from the dome was bigger than an elephant, and
in shape something like a gigantic slug, except that it had a fringe of
tentacles all about its body. And from these writhing tentacles crackled
sparks and flashes of blue flame. It spread its writhing arms, and at their
touch stone walls crashed to ruin and masonry burst apart. It was brainless,
sightless&mdash;elemental force incorporated in the lowest form of
animation&mdash;power gone mad and run amuck in a senseless fury of
destruction.</p>

<p>There was neither plan nor direction to its plunges. It rushed
erratically, literally plowing through solid walls which buckled and gave
way, falling on it in showers which did not seem to injure it. On all sides
men fled aghast.</p>

<p>"Get back through the shaft, all who can!" I yelled.
"Take the girls&mdash;get them out first!" I was dragging the
dazed creatures from the prison chamber and thrusting them into the arms of
the nearest warriors, who carried them away. On all sides of us the towers
and minarets were crumbling and roaring down in ruin.</p>

<p>"Make ropes of the tapestries," I yelled. "Slide down
the cliff! In God's name, hasten! This fiend will destroy the whole
city before it is done!"</p>

<p>"I've found a bunch of rope ladders," shouted a warrior.
"They'll reach to the water's edge, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then fasten them and send the women down them," I shrieked.
"Better take the chance of the river, then&mdash;here, Ghor, take
Altha!"</p>

<p>I threw her into the arms of the bloodstained giant, and rushed toward the
mountain of destruction which was crashing through the walls of Yugga.</p>

<p><br>Of that cataclysmic frenzy I have only a confused memory, an impression of
crashing walls, howling humans, and that engine of doom roaring through all,
with a ghastly aurora playing about it, as the electric power in its awful
body blasted its way through solid stone.</p>

<p>How many Yagas, warriors and women slaves died in the falling castles is
not to be known. Some hundreds had escaped down the shaft when falling roofs
and walls blocked that way, crushing scores who were trying to reach it. Our
warriors worked frenziedly, and the silken ladders were strung down the
cliffs, some over the town of Akka, some in haste, over the river, and down
these the warriors carried the slave-girls&mdash;Guras, red and yellow girls
alike.</p>

<p>After I had seen Ghor carry Altha away I wheeled and ran straight toward
that electric horror. It was not intelligent, and what I expected to
accomplish I do not know. But through the reeling walls and among the rocking
towers that spilled down showers of stone blocks I raced, until I stood
before the rearing horror. Blind and brainless though it was, yet it
possessed some form of sensibility, because instantly, as I hurled a heavy
stone at it, its movements ceased to be erratic. It charged straight for me,
casting splintered masonry right and left, as foam is thrown by the rush of
an ox through a stream.</p>

<p>I ran fleetly from it, leading it away from the screaming masses of
humanity that struggled and fled along the rim of the cliff, and suddenly
found myself on a battlement on the edge of the cliff, with a sheer drop of
five hundred feet beneath me to the river Yogh. Behind me came the monster.
As I turned desperately, it reared up and plunged at me. In the middle of its
gigantic slug-like body I saw a dark spot as big as my hand pulsing. I knew
that this must be the center of the being's life, and I sprang at it
like a wounded tiger, plunging my sword into that dark spot.</p>

<p>Whether I reached it or not, I did not know. Even as I leaped, the whole
universe exploded in one burst of blinding white flame and thunder, followed
instantly by the blackness of oblivion.</p>

<p>They say that at the instant my sword sank into the body of the
fire-monster, both it and I were enveloped in a blinding blue flame. There
was a deafening report, like a thunderclap, that tore the creature asunder,
and hurled its mangled form, with my body, far out over the cliff, to fall
five hundred feet into the deep blue waters of Yogh.</p>

<p>It was Thab who saved me from drowning, leaping into the river despite his
crippled condition, to dive until he found and dragged my senseless body from
the water.</p>

<p>You will say, perhaps, that it is impossible for a man to fall five
hundred feet into water and live. My only reply is that I did it, and I live;
though I doubt if there is any man on Earth who could do it.</p>

<p>For a long time I was senseless and for longer I lay in delirium; for
longer again, I lay completely paralyzed, my disrupted and numbed nerves
slowly coming back into life again.</p>

<p>I came to myself on a couch in Koth. I knew nothing of the long trek back
through the forests and across the plains from the doomed city of Yugga. Of
the nine thousand men who marched to Yagg, only five thousand returned,
wounded, weary, bloodstained, but triumphant. With them came fifty thousand
women, the freed slaves of the vanquished Yagas. Those who were neither
Kothan nor Khoran were escorted to their own cities&mdash;a thing unique in
the history of Almuric. The little yellow and red women were given the
freedom of either city, and allowed to dwell there in full freedom.</p>

<p>As for me, I have Altha&mdash;and she has me. The glamor of her, akin to
glory, dazzled me with its brilliance, when first I saw her bending over my
couch after my return from Yagg. Her features seemed to glimmer and float
above me; then they coalesced into a vision of transcendent loveliness, yet
strangely familiar to me. Our love will last forever, for it has been
annealed in the white-hot fires of a mutual experience&mdash;of a savage
ordeal and a great suffering.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time, there is peace between the cities of Khor and
Koth, which have sworn eternal friendship to each other; and the only warfare
is the unremitting struggle waged against the ferocious wild beasts and weird
forms of animal life that abound in much of the planet. And we two&mdash;I an
Earthman born, and Altha, a daughter of Almuric who possesses the gentler
instincts of an Earthwoman&mdash;we hope to instill some of the culture of my
native planet into this erstwhile savage people before we die and become as
the dust of my adopted planet, Almuric.</p>
