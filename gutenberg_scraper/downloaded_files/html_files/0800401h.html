<h2><a name="c0" id="c0"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>On the twenty-third of December, 1787, His Majesty's armed
transport <i>Bounty</i> sailed from Portsmouth on as strange,
eventful, and tragic a voyage as ever befell an English ship. Her
errand was to proceed to the island of Tahiti (or Otaheite, as it
was then called), in the Great South Sea, there to collect a cargo
of young breadfruit trees for transportation to the West Indies,
where, it was hoped, the trees would thrive and thus, eventually,
provide an abundance of cheap food for the negro slaves of the
English planters.</p>

<p>The events of that voyage it is the purpose of this tale to
unfold. <i>Mutiny on the Bounty</i>, which opens the story, is
concerned with the voyage from England, the long Tahiti sojourn
while the cargo of young breadfruit trees was being assembled, the
departure of the homeward-bound ship, the mutiny, and the fate of
those of her company who later returned to Tahiti, where the
greater part of them were eventually seized by H. M. S.
<i>Pandora</i> and taken back to England, in irons, for trial.</p>

<p>The authors chose as the narrator of this part of the tale a
fictitious character, Roger Byam, who tells it as an old man, after
his retirement from the Navy. Byam had his actual counterpart in
the person of Peter Heywood, whose name was, for this reason,
omitted from the roster of the <i>Bounty's</i> company. Midshipman
Byam's experience follows closely that of Midshipman Heywood. With
the license of hisorical novelists, the authors based the career of
Byam upon that of I Heywood, but in depicting it they did not, of
course, follow the latter n every detail. In the essentials,
relating to the mutiny and its aftermath, they have adhered to the
facts preserved in the records of the I British Admiralty.</p>

<p><i>Men Against the Sea</i>, the second part of the narrative, is
the story of Captain Bligh and the eighteen loyal men who, on the
morning of lie mutiny, were set adrift by the mutineers in the
<i>Bounty's</i> launch, an open boat twenty-three feet long, with a
beam of six feet, nine inches. In this small craft Captain Bligh
carried his men a voyage of 3600 miles, from the island of Tofoa
(or Tofua, as it is now called), in the Friendly, or Tongan Group,
to Timor, in the Dutch East Indies. The wind and weather of <i>Men
Against the Sea</i> are those of Captain Bligh's own log, a series
of brief daily notes which formed the chief literary source of this
part of the tale. The voyage is described in the words of one of
those who survived it&mdash;Thomas Ledward, acting surgeon of the
<i>Bounty</i>, whose medical knowledge and whose experience in
reading men's sufferings would qualify him as a sensitive and
reliable observer.</p>

<p><i>Pitcairn's Island</i>, which concludes the tale, is perhaps
the strangest and most romantic part of it. After two unsuccessful
attempts to settle on the island of Tupuai (or Tubuai, as the name
is now more commonly spelled), the mutineers returned to Tahiti,
where they parted company. Fletcher Christian, acting lieutenant of
the <i>Bounty</i> and instigator of the mutiny, once more embarked
in the ship for an unknown destination. With him were eight of his
own men and eighteen Polynesians (twelve women and six men). They
sailed from Tahiti in September 1789, and for a period of eighteen
years nothing more was heard of them. In February 1808, the
American sealing vessel <i>Topaz</i>, calling at Pitcairn,
discovered on this supposedly uninhabited crumb of land a thriving
community of mixed blood: a number of middle-aged Polynesian women
and more than a score of children, under the benevolent rule of a
white-haired English seaman, Alexander Smith, the only survivor of
the fifteen men who had landed there so long before.</p>

<p>Various and discrepant accounts have been preserved concerning
the events which took place on Pitcairn during the eighteen years
preceding the visit of the <i>Topaz</i>. The source of them all,
direct or indirect, was Alexander Smith (or John Adams, as he later
called himself). He told the story first to Captain Folger, of the
<i>Topaz</i>; then, in 1814, to Captains Staines and Pipon, of the
English frigates <i>Briton</i> and <i>Tagus</i>; then to Captain
Beechey, of <i>H. M. S. Blossom</i>, in 1825; and finally, in 1829,
to J. A. Moerenhout, author of <i>Voyages aux &Icirc;les du Grand
Oc&eacute;an</i>. Later accounts were recorded by Walter Brodie,
who set down, in 1850, a narrative obtained from Arthur, Matthew
Quintal's son; and by Rosalind Young, in her <i>Story of Pitcairn
Island</i>, which gives certain details retained in the memory of
Eliza, daughter of John Mills, who reached the advanced age of
ninety-three.</p>

<p>Each of these accounts is remarkable for its differences from
the others. The authors, therefore, after careful study of every
existing account, adopted a chronology and selected a sequence of
events which seemed to them to render more plausible the play of
cause and effect.</p>

<p>The history of those early years on Pitcairn was tragic, perhaps
inevitably so. Fifteen men and twelve women, of two widely
different races, were set down on a small island, one of the
loneliest in the world. At the end of a decade, although there were
many children, only one man and ten women remained; of the sixteen
dead, fifteen had come to violent ends. These are the facts upon
which all the accounts agree. If, at times, in the Pitcairn
narrative, blood flows over-freely, and horror seems to pile on
horror, it is not because the authors would have it so: it was so,
in Pitcairn history.</p>

<p>But the outcome of those early turbulent years was no less
extraordinary than the threads of chance which led to the
settlement of the island. All who were fortunate enough to visit
the Pitcairn colony during the first quarter of the nineteenth
century agree that it presented a veritable picture of the Golden
Age.</p>

<p>Those who are interested in the source material concerning the
<i>Bounty</i> mutiny will find an exhaustive bibliography of books,
articles, and unpublished manuscripts in the Appendix to Mr. George
Mackaness's <i>Life of Vice-Admiral William Bligh</i>, published by
Messrs. Angus and Robertson, of Sydney, Australia. Among the
principal sources consulted by the authors were the following:
"Minutes of the Proceedings of a Court-Martial on Lieutenant
William Bligh and certain members of his crew, to investigate the
cause of the loss of H. M. S. <i>Bounty</i>"; <i>A Narrative of the
Mutiny on Board His Majesty's Ship "Bounty</i>," by William Bligh;
<i>A Voyage to the South Sea</i>, by William Bligh; <i>The Mutiny
and Piratical Seizure of H. M. S. "Bounty</i>," by Sir John Barrow;
<i>Pitcairn island and the Islanders</i>, by Walter Brodie;
<i>Mutineers of the "Bounty" and Their Descendants in Pitcairn and
Norfolk Islands</i>, by Lady Belcher; <i>Bligh of the "Bounty</i>,"
by Geoffrey Rawson; <i>Voyage of H. M. S. "Pandora,"</i> by E.
Edwards and G. Hamilton; <i>The Life of Vice-Admiral William
Bligh</i>, by George Mackaness; <i>The Story of Pitcairn
Island</i>, by Rosalind Young; <i>Captain Bligh's Second Voyage to
the South Seas</i>, by I. Lee; <i>Pitcairn Island Register Book;
New South Wales Historical Records</i>; Cook's <i>Voyages</i>;
Hawkesworth's <i>Voyages</i>; Beechey's <i>Voyages</i>; Ellis's
<i>Polynesian Researches; Ancient Tahiti</i>, by Teura Henry; and
<i>A Memoir of Peter Heywood</i>. Two excellent studies of the
present-day descendants of the <i>Bounty</i> mutineers, from the
point of view of an anthropologist, have been made by Dr. Harry
Shapiro in his <i>Descendants of the Bounty Mutineers</i> and
<i>The Heritage of the Bounty</i>.</p>

<p>We wish to express our cordial thanks to Mr. N. C. Wyeth, whose
illustrations lend so much colour and vividness to the story of the
<i>Bounty</i> and her men.</p>

<h2><a name="c1" id="c1"></a>CHAPTER I.&mdash;LIEUTENANT BLIGH</h2>

<p>The British are frequently criticized by other nations for their
dislike of change, and indeed we love England for those aspects of
nature and life which change the least. Here in the West Country,
where I was born, men are slow of speech, tenacious of opinion, and
averse&mdash;beyond their countrymen elsewhere&mdash;to innovation
of any sort. The houses of my neighbours, the tenants' cottages,
the very fishing boats which ply on the Bristol Channel, all
conform to the patterns of a simpler age. And an old man, forty of
whose three-and-seventy years have been spent afloat, may be
pardoned a not unnatural tenderness toward the scenes of his youth,
and a satisfaction that these scenes remain so little altered by
time.</p>

<p>No men are more conservative than those who design and build
ships save those who sail them; and since storms are less frequent
at sea than some landsmen suppose, the life of a sailor is
principally made up of the daily performance of certain tasks, in
certain manners and at certain times. Forty years of this life have
made a slave of me, and I continue, almost against my will, to live
by the clock. There is no reason why I should rise at seven each
morning, yet seven finds me dressing, nevertheless; my copy of the
<i>Times</i> would reach me even though I failed to order a horse
saddled at ten for my ride down to Watchet to meet the post. But
habit is too much for me, and habit finds a powerful ally in old
Thacker, my housekeeper, whose duties, as I perceive with inward
amusement, are lightened by the regularity she does everything to
encourage. She will listen to no hint of retirement. In spite of
her years, which must number nearly eighty by now, her step is
still brisk and her black eyes snap with a remnant of the old
malice. It would give me pleasure to speak with her of the days
when my mother was still living, but when I try to draw her into
talk she wastes no time in putting me in my place. Servant and
master, with the churchyard only a step ahead! I am lonely now;
when Thacker dies, I shall be lonely indeed.</p>

<p>Seven generations of Byams have lived and died in Withycombe;
the name has been known in the region of the Quantock Hills for
five hundred years and more. I am the last of them; it is strange
to think that at my death what remains of our blood will flow in
the veins of an Indian woman in the South Sea.</p>

<p>If it be true that a man's useful life is over on the day when
his thoughts begin to dwell in the past, then I have served little
purpose in living since my retirement from His Majesty's Navy
fifteen years ago. The present has lost substance and reality, and
I have discovered, with some regret, that contemplation of the
future brings neither pleasure nor concern. But forty years at sea,
including the turbulent period of the wars against the Danes, the
Dutch, and the French, have left my memory so well stored that I
ask no greater delight than to be free to wander in the past.</p>

<p>My study, high up in the north wing of Withycombe, with its tall
windows giving on the Bristol Channel and the green distant coast
of Wales, is the point of departure for these travels through the
past. The journal I have kept, since I went to sea as a midshipman
in 1787, lies at hand in the camphor-wood box beside my chair, and
I have only to take up a sheaf of its pages to smell once more the
reek of battle smoke, to feel the stinging sleet of a gale in the
North Sea, or to enjoy the calm beauty of a tropical night under
the constellations of the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>In the evening, when the unimportant duties of an old man's day
are done, and I have supped alone in silence, I feel the pleasant
anticipation of a visitor to Town, who on his first evening spends
an agreeable half-hour in deciding which theatre he will attend.
Shall I fight the old battles over again? Camperdown, Copenhagen,
Trafalgar&mdash;these names thunder in memory like the booming of
great guns. Yet more and more frequently I turn the pages of my
journal still further back, to the frayed and blotted log of a
midshipman&mdash;to an episode I have spent a good part of my life
in attempting to forget. Insignificant in the annals of the Navy,
and even more so from an historian's point of view, this incident
was nevertheless the strangest, the most picturesque, and the most
tragic of my career.</p>

<p>It has long been my purpose to follow the example of other
retired officers and employ the too abundant leisure of an old man
in setting down, with the aid of my journal and in the fullest
possible detail, a narrative of some one of the episodes of my life
at sea. The decision was made last night; I shall write of my first
ship, the <i>Bounty</i>, of the mutiny on board, of my long
residence on the island of Tahiti in the South Sea, and of how I
was conveyed home in irons, to be tried by court-martial and
condemned to death. Two natures clashed on the stage of that drama
of long ago, two men as strong and enigmatical as any I have
known&mdash;Fletcher Christian and William Bligh.</p>

<p>When my father died of a pleurisy, early in the spring of 1787,
my mother gave few outward signs of grief, though their life
together, in an age when the domestic virtues were unfashionable,
had been a singularly happy one. Sharing the interest in the
natural sciences which had brought my father the honour of a
Fellowship in the Royal Society, my mother was a countrywoman at
heart, caring more for life at Withycombe than for the artificial
distractions of town.</p>

<p>I was to have gone up to Oxford that fall, to Magdalen, my
father's college, and during that first summer of my mother's
widowhood I began to know her, not as a parent, but as a most
charming companion, of whose company I never wearied. The women of
her generation were schooled to reserve their tears for the
sufferings of others, and to meet adversity with a smile. A warm
heart and an inquiring mind made her conversation entertaining or
philosophical as the occasion required; and, unlike the young
ladies of the present time, she had been taught that silence can be
agreeable when one has nothing to say.</p>

<p>On the morning when Sir Joseph Banks's letter arrived, we were
strolling about the garden, scarcely exchanging a word. It was late
in July, the sky was blue, and the warm air bore the scent of
roses; such a morning as enables us to tolerate our English
climate, which foreigners declare, perhaps with some justice, the
worst in the world. I was thinking how uncommonly handsome my
mother looked in black, with her thick fair hair, fresh colour, and
dark blue eyes. Thacker, her new maid,&mdash;a black-eyed Devon
girl,&mdash;came tripping down the path. She dropped my mother a
curtsey and held out a letter on a silver tray. My mother took the
letter, gave me a glance of apology, and began to read, seating
herself on a rustic bench.</p>

<p>"From Sir Joseph," she said, when she had perused the letter at
length and laid it down. "You have heard of Lieutenant Bligh, who
was with Captain Cook on his last voyage? Sir Joseph writes that he
is on leave, stopping with friends near Taunton, and would enjoy an
evening with us. Your father thought very highly of him."</p>

<p>I was a rawboned lad of seventeen, lazy in body and mind, with
overfast growth, but the words were like a galvanic shock to me.
"With Captain Cook!" I exclaimed. "Ask him by all means!"</p>

<p>My mother smiled. "I thought you would be pleased," she
said.</p>

<p>The carriage was dispatched in good time with a note for Mr.
Bligh, bidding him to dine with us that evening if he could. I
remember how I set out, with the son of one of our tenants, to sail
my boat at high tide on Bridgwater Bay, and how little I enjoyed
the sail. My thoughts were all of our visitor, and the hours till
dinner-time seemed to stretch ahead interminably.</p>

<p>I was fonder, perhaps, of reading than most lads of my age, and
the book I loved best of all was one given me by my father on my
tenth birthday&mdash;Dr. Hawkesworth's account of the voyages to
the South Sea. I knew the three, heavy, leather-bound volumes
almost by heart, and I had read with equal interest the French
narrative of Monsieur de Bougainville's voyage. These early
accounts of discoveries in the South Sea, and of the manners and
customs of the inhabitants of Otaheite and Owhyhee (as those
islands were then called), excited an interest almost inconceivable
to-day. The writings of Jean Jacques Rousseau, which were to have
such lamentable and far-reaching results, preached a doctrine which
had made converts even among people of consequence. It became
fashionable to believe that only among men in a state of nature,
freed from all restraints, could true virtue and happiness be
found. And when Wallis, Byron, Bougainville, and Cook returned from
their voyage of discovery with alluring accounts of the New
Cytheraea, whose happy inhabitants, relieved from the curse of
Adam, spent their days in song and dance, the doctrines of Rousseau
received new impetus. Even my father, so engrossed in his
astronomical studies that he had lost touch with the world,
listened eagerly to the tales of his friend Sir Joseph Banks, and
often discussed with my mother, whose interest was equal to his,
the virtues of what he termed "a natural life."</p>

<p>My own interest was less philosophical than adventurous; like
other youngsters, I longed to sail unknown seas, to raise uncharted
islands, and to trade with gentle Indians who regarded white men as
gods. The thought that I was soon to converse with an officer who
had accompanied Captain Cook on his last voyage&mdash;a mariner,
and not a man of science like Sir Joseph&mdash;kept me
woolgathering all afternoon, and I was not disappointed when the
carriage drew up at last and Mr. Bligh stepped out.</p>

<p>Bligh was at that time in the prime of life. He was of middle
stature, strongly made and inclining to stoutness, though he
carried himself well. His weather-beaten face was broad, with a
firm mouth and very fine dark eyes, and his thick powdered hair
grew high on his head, above a noble brow. He wore his
three-cornered black hat athwartships; his coat was of bright blue
broadcloth, trimmed with white, with gold anchor buttons and the
long tails of the day. His waistcoat, breeches, and stockings were
white. The old-fashioned uniform was one to set off a well-made
man. Bligh's voice, strong, vibrant, and a little harsh, gave an
impression of uncommon vitality; his bearing showed resolution and
courage, and the glance of his eye gave evidence of an assurance
such as few men possess. These symptoms of a strong and aggressive
nature were tempered by the lofty brow of a man of intellect, and
the agreeable and unpretentious manner he assumed ashore.</p>

<p>The carriage, as I said, drew up before our door, the footman
sprang down from the box, and Mr. Bligh stepped out. I had been
waiting to welcome him; as I made myself known, he gave me a
handclasp and a smile.</p>

<p>"Your father's son," he said. "A great loss&mdash;he was known,
by name at least, to all who practise navigation."</p>

<p>Presently my mother came down and we went in to dinner. Bligh
spoke very handsomely of my father's work on the determination of
longitude, and after a time the conversation turned to the islands
of the South Sea.</p>

<p>"Is it true," my mother asked, "that the Indians of Tahiti are
as happy as Captain Cook believed?"</p>

<p>"Ah, ma'am," said our guest, "happiness is a vast word! It is
true that they live without great labour, and that nearly all of
the light tasks they perform are self-imposed; released from the
fear of want and from all salutary discipline, they regard nothing
seriously."</p>

<p>"Roger and I," observed my mother, "have been studying the ideas
of J. J. Rousseau. As you know, he believes that true happiness can
only be enjoyed by man in a state of nature."</p>

<p>Bligh nodded. "I have been told of his ideas," he said, "though
unfortunately I left school too young to learn French. But if a
rough seaman may express an opinion on a subject more suited to a
philosopher, I believe that true happiness can only be enjoyed by a
disciplined and enlightened people. As for the Indians of Tahiti,
though they are freed from the fear of want, their conduct is
regulated by a thousand absurd restrictions, which no civilized man
would put up with. These restrictions constitute a kind of
unwritten law, called <i>taboo</i>, and instead of making for a
wholesome discipline they lay down fanciful and unjust rules to
control every action of a man's life. A few days among men in a
state of nature might have changed Monsieur Rousseau's ideas." He
paused and turned to me. "You know French, then?" he asked, as if
to include me in the talk.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I replied.</p>

<p>"I'll do him justice, Mr. Bligh," my mother put in; "he has a
gift for languages. My son might pass for a native of France or
Italy, and is making progress in German now. His Latin won him a
prize last year."</p>

<p>"I wish I had his gift! Lord!" Bligh laughed. "I'd rather face a
hurricane than translate a page of Caesar nowadays! And the task
Sir Joseph has set me is worse still! There is no harm in telling
you that I shall soon set sail for the South Sea." Perceiving our
interest, he went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have been in the merchant service since I was paid off four
years ago, when peace was signed. Mr. Campbell, the West India
merchant, gave me command of his ship, <i>Britannia</i>, and during
my voyages, when I frequently had planters of consequence as
passengers on board, I was many times asked to tell what I knew of
the breadfruit, which flourishes in Tahiti and Owhyhee. Considering
that the breadfruit might provide a cheap and wholesome food for
their negro slaves, several of the West India merchants and
planters petitioned the Crown, asking that a vessel be fitted out
suitably to convey the breadfruit from Tahiti to the West Indian
islands. Sir Joseph Banks thought well of the idea and gave it his
support. It is due largely to his interest that the Admiralty is
now fitting out a small vessel for the voyage, and at Sir Joseph's
suggestion I was recalled to the Service and am to be given
command. We should sail before the end of the year."</p>

<p>"Were I a man," said my mother, whose eyes were bright with
interest, "I should beg you to take me along; you will need
gardeners, no doubt, and I could care for the young plants."</p>

<p>Bligh smiled. "I would ask no better, ma'am," he said gallantly,
"though I have been supplied with a botanist&mdash;David Nelson,
who served in a similar capacity on Captain Cook's last voyage. My
ship, the <i>Bounty</i>, will be a floating garden fitted with
every convenience for the care of the plants, and I have no fear
but that we shall be able to carry out the purpose of the voyage.
It is the task our good friend Sir Joseph has enjoined on me that
presents the greatest difficulty. He has solicited me most
earnestly to employ my time in Tahiti in acquiring a greater
knowledge of the Indians and their customs, and a more complete
vocabulary and grammar of their language, than it has hitherto been
possible to gather. He believes that a dictionary of the language,
in particular, might prove of the greatest service to mariners in
the South Sea. But I know as little of dictionaries as of Greek,
and shall have no one on board qualified for such a task."</p>

<p>"How shall you lay your course, sir?" I asked. "About Cape
Horn?"</p>

<p>"I shall make the attempt, though the season will be advanced
beyond the time of easterly winds. We shall return from Tahiti by
way of the East Indies and the Cape of Good Hope."</p>

<p>My mother gave me a glance and we rose as she took leave of us.
While he cracked walnuts and sipped my father's Madeira, Bligh
questioned me, in the agreeable manner he knew so well how to
assume, as to my knowledge of languages. At last he seemed
satisfied, finished the wine in his glass, and shook his head at
the man who would have filled it. He was moderate in the use of
wine, in an age when nearly all the officers of His Majesty's Navy
drank to excess. Finally he spoke.</p>

<p>"Young man," he said seriously, "how would you like to sail with
me?"</p>

<p>I had been thinking, ever since his first mention of the voyage,
that I should like nothing better, but his words took me aback. "Do
you mean it, sir?" I stammered. "Would it be possible?"</p>

<p>"It rests with you and Mrs. Byam to decide. It would be a
pleasure to make a place for you among my young gentlemen."</p>

<p>The warm summer evening was as beautiful as the day that had
preceded it, and when we had joined my mother in the garden, she
and Bligh spoke of the projected voyage. I knew that he was waiting
for me to mention his proposal, and presently, during a pause in
the talk, I summoned up my courage.</p>

<p>"Mother," I said, "Lieutenant Bligh has been good enough to
suggest that I accompany him."</p>

<p>If she felt surprise, she gave no sign of it, but turned calmly
to our guest. "You have paid Roger a compliment," she remarked.
"Could an inexperienced lad be of use to you on board?"</p>

<p>"He'll make a seaman, ma'am, never fear! I've taken a fancy to
the cut of his jib, as the old tars say. And I could put his gift
for languages to good use."</p>

<p>"How long shall you be gone?"</p>

<p>"Two years, perhaps."</p>

<p>"He was to have gone up to Oxford, but I suppose that could
wait." She turned to me half banteringly. "Well, sir, what do you
say?"</p>

<p>"With your permission, there is nothing I would rather do."</p>

<p>She smiled at me in the twilight and gave my hand a little pat.
"Then you have it," she said. "I would be the last to stand in the
way. A voyage to the South Sea! If I were a lad and Mr. Bligh would
have me, I'd run away from home to join his ship!"</p>

<p>Bligh gave one of his short, harsh laughs and looked at my
mother admiringly. "You'd have made a rare sailor, ma'am," he
remarked&mdash;"afraid of nothing, I'll wager."</p>

<p>It was arranged that I should join the <i>Bounty</i> at
Spithead, but the storing, and victualing, and fitting-out took so
long that the autumn was far advanced before she was ready to sail.
In October I took leave of my mother and went up to London to order
my uniforms, to call on old Mr. Erskine, our solicitor, and to pay
my respects to Sir Joseph Banks.</p>

<p>My clearest memory of those days is of an evening at Sir
Joseph's house. He was a figure of romance to my eyes&mdash;a
handsome, florid man of forty-five, President of the Royal Society,
companion of the immortal Captain Cook, friend of Indian
princesses, and explorer of Labrador, Iceland, and the great South
Sea. When we had dined, he led me to his study, hung with strange
weapons and ornaments from distant lands. He took up from among the
papers on his table a sheaf of manuscript.</p>

<p>"My vocabulary of the Tahitian language," he said. "I have had
this copy made. It is short and imperfect, as you will discover,
but may prove of some service to you. Please observe that the
system of spelling Captain Cook and I adopted should be changed. I
have given the matter some thought, and Bligh agrees with me that
it will be better and simpler to set down the words as an Italian
would spell them&mdash;particularly in the case of the vowels. You
know Italian, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Good!" he went on. "You will be some months in Tahiti, while
they are gathering the young breadfruit plants. Bligh will see to
it that you are given leisure to devote yourself to the dictionary
I hope to publish on your return. Dialects of the Tahitian language
are spoken over an immense space of the South Sea, and a dictionary
of the commoner words, with some little information as to the
grammar, will be in demand among mariners before many years have
passed. At present we think of the South Sea as little less remote
than the moon, but depend on it, the rich whale fisheries and new
lands for planting and settlement will soon attract notice, now
that we have lost the American Colonies.</p>

<p>"There are many distractions in Tahiti," he went on after a
pause; "take care that you are not misled into wasting your time.
And, above all, take care in the selection of your Indian friends.
When a ship drops anchor in Matavai Bay the Indians come out in
throngs, each eager to choose a friend, or <i>taio</i>, from
amongst her company. Bide your time, learn something of politics on
shore, and choose as your <i>taio</i> a man of consideration and
authority. Such a man can be of infinite use to you; in return for
a few axes, knives, fishhooks, and trinkets for his women, he will
keep you supplied with fresh provisions, entertain you at his
residence when you step ashore, and do everything in his power to
make himself useful. Should you make the mistake of choosing as
your <i>taio</i> a man of the lower orders, you may find him dull,
incurious, and with an imperfect knowledge of the Indian tongue. In
my opinion they are not only a different class, but a different
race, conquered long ago by those who now rule the land. Persons of
consequence in Tahiti are taller, fairer, and vastly more
intelligent than the <i>manahune</i>, or serfs."</p>

<p>"Then there is no more equality in Tahiti than amongst
ourselves?"</p>

<p>Sir Joseph smiled. "Less, I should say. The Indians have a false
appearance of equality from the simplicity of their manners and the
fact that the employments of all classes are the same. The king may
be seen heading a fishing party, or the queen paddling her own
canoe, or beating out bark cloth with her women. But of real
equality there is none; no action, however meritorious, can raise a
man above the position to which he was born. The chiefs alone,
believed to be descended from the gods, are thought to have souls."
He paused, fingers drumming on the arm of his chair. "You've
everything you will need?" he asked. "Clothing, writing materials,
money? Midshipmen's fare is not the best in the world, but when you
go on board, one of the master's mates will ask each of you for
three or four pounds to lay in a few small luxuries for the berth.
Have you a sextant?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;one of my father's; I showed it to Mr.
Bligh."</p>

<p>"I'm glad Bligh's in command; there's not a better seaman
afloat. I am told that he is a bit of a tartar at sea, but better a
taut hand than a slack one, any day! He will instruct you in your
duties; perform them smartly, and remember&mdash;discipline's the
thing!"</p>

<p>I took my leave of Sir Joseph with his last words still ringing
in my ears&mdash;"Discipline's the thing!" I was destined to ponder
over them deeply, and sometimes bitterly, before we met again.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c2" id="c2"></a>CHAPTER II.&mdash;SEA LAW</h2>

<p>Toward the end of November I joined the <i>Bounty</i> at
Spithead. It makes me smile to-day to think of the box I brought
down on the coach from London, packed with clothing and uniforms on
which I had laid out more than a hundred pounds: blue tail-coats
lined with white silk, with the white patch on the collar known in
those days as a "weekly account"; breeches and waistcoats of white
nankeen, and a brace of "scrapers"&mdash;smart three-cornered
reefer's hats, with gold loops and cockades. For a few days I made
a brave show in my finery, but when the <i>Bounty</i> sailed it was
stowed away for good, and worn no more.</p>

<p>Our ship looked no bigger than a longboat among the tall
first-rates and seventy-fours at anchor near by. She had been built
for the merchant service, at Hull, three years before, and
purchased for two thousand pounds; ninety feet long on deck and
with a beam of twenty-four feet, her burthen was little more than
two hundred tons. Her name&mdash;<i>Bethia</i>&mdash;had been
painted out, and at the suggestion of Sir Joseph Banks she was
rechristened <i>Bounty</i>. The ship had been many months at
Deptford, where the Admiralty had spent more than four thousand
pounds in altering and refitting her. The great cabin aft was now
rigged as a garden, with innumerable pots standing in racks, and
gutters running below to allow the water to be used over and over
again. The result was that Lieutenant Bligh and the master, Mr.
Fryer, were squeezed into two small cabins on either side of the
ladderway, and forced to mess with the surgeon, in a screened-off
space of the lower deck, aft of the main hatch. The ship was small
to begin with; she carried a heavy cargo of stores and articles for
barter with the Indians, and all hands on board were so cramped
that I heard mutterings even before we set sail. I believe, in
fact, that the discomfort of our life, and the bad humour it
brought about, played no small part in the unhappy ending of a
voyage which seemed ill-fated from the start.</p>

<p>The <i>Bounty</i> was copper-sheathed, a new thing in those
days, and with her bluff, heavy hull, short masts, and stout
rigging, she looked more like a whaling vessel than an armed
transport of His Majesty's Navy. She carried a pair of swivel guns
mounted on stocks forward, and six swivels and four tour-pounders
aft, on the upper deck.</p>

<p>All was new and strange to me on the morning when I presented
myself to Lieutenant Bligh, the ship was crowded with
women,&mdash;the sailors' "wives,"&mdash;rum seemed to flow like
water everywhere, and sharp-faced Jews, in their wherries, hovered
alongside, eager to lend money at interest against pay day, or to
sell on credit the worthless trinkets on their trays. The cries of
the bumboat men, the shrill scolding of the women, and the shouts
and curses of the sailors made a pandemonium stunning to a
landsman's ears.</p>

<p>Making my way aft, I found Mr. Bligh on the quarter-deck. A
tall, swarthy man was just ahead of me.</p>

<p>"I have been to the Portsmouth observatory, sir," he said to the
captain; "the timekeeper is one minute fifty-two seconds too fast
for mean time, and losing at the rate of one second a day. Mr.
Bailey made a note of it in this letter to you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Christian," said Bligh shortly, and at that
moment, turning his head, he caught sight of me. I uncovered,
stepping forward to present myself. "Ah, Mr. Byam," he went on,
"this is Mr. Christian, the master's mate; he will show you your
berth and instruct you in some of your duties...And, by the way,
you will dine with me on board the <i>Tigress</i>; Captain Courtney
knew your father and asked me to bring you when he heard that you
would be on board." He glanced at his large silver watch. "Be ready
in an hour's time."</p>

<p>I bowed in reply to his nod of dismissal and followed Christian
to the ladderway. The berth was a screened-off space of the lower
deck, on the larboard side, abreast of the main hatch. Its
dimensions were scarcely more than eight feet by ten, yet four of
us were to make this kennel our home. Three or four boxes stood
around the sides, and a scuttle of heavy discoloured glass admitted
a dim light. A quadrant hung on a nail driven into the ship's side,
and, though she was not long from Deptford, a reek of bilge water
hung in the air. A handsome, sulky-looking boy of sixteen, in a
uniform like my own, was arranging the gear in his box, and
straightened up to give me a contemptuous stare. His name was
Hayward, as I learned when Christian introduced us briefly, and he
scarcely deigned to take my outstretched hand.</p>

<p>When we regained the upper deck, Christian lost his air of
preoccupation, and smiled. "Mr. Hayward has been two years at sea,"
he remarked; "he knows you for a Johnny Newcomer. But the
<i>Bounty</i> is a little ship; such airs would be more fitting
aboard a first-rate."</p>

<p>He spoke in a cultivated voice, with a trace of the Manx accent,
and I could barely hear the words above the racket from the forward
part of the ship. It was a calm, bright winter morning, and I
studied my companion in the clear sunlight. He was a man to glance
at more than once.</p>

<p>Fletcher Christian was at that time in his twenty-fourth
year,&mdash;a fine figure of a seaman in his plain blue,
gold-buttoned frock,&mdash;handsomely and strongly built, with
thick dark brown hair and a complexion naturally dark, and burned
by the sun to a shade rarely seen among the white race. His mouth
and chin expressed great resolution of character, and his eyes,
black, deep-set, and brilliant, had something of hypnotic power in
their far-away gaze. He looked more like a Spaniard than an
Englishman, though his family had been settled since the fifteenth
century on the Isle of Man. Christian was what women call a
romantic-looking man; his moods of gaiety alternated with fits of
black depression, and he possessed a fiery temper which he
controlled by efforts that brought the sweat to his brow. Though
only a master's mate, a step above a midshipman, he was of gentle
birth&mdash;better born than Bligh and a gentleman in manner and
speech.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Bligh," he said, in his musing, abstracted way,
"desires me to instruct you in some of your duties. Navigation,
nautical astronomy, and trigonometry he will teach you himself,
since we have no schoolmaster on board, as on a man-of-war. And I
can assure you that you will not sup till you have worked out the
ship's position each day. You will be assigned to one of the
watches, to keep order when the men are at the braces or aloft. You
will see that the hammocks are stowed in the morning, and report
the men whose hammocks are badly lashed. Never lounge against the
guns or the ship's side, and never walk the deck with your hands in
your pockets. You will be expected to go aloft with the men to
learn how to bend canvas and how to reef and furl a sail, and when
the ship is at anchor you may be placed in charge of one of the
boats. And, last of all, you are the slave of those tyrants, the
master and master's mates."</p>

<p>He gave me a whimsical glance and a smile. We were standing by
the gratings abaft the mainmast, and at that moment a stout elderly
man, in a uniform much like Bligh's, came puffing up the ladderway.
His bronzed face was at once kindly and resolute, and I should have
known him for a seaman anywhere.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Christian, there you are!" he exclaimed as he heaved
himself on deck. "What a madhouse! I'd like to sink the lot of
those Jews, and heave the wenches overboard! Who's this? The new
reefer, Mr. Byam, I'll be bound! Welcome on board, Mr. Byam; your
father's name stands high in our science, eh, Mr. Christian?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Fryer, the master," said Christian in my ear.</p>

<p>"A madhouse," Fryer went on. "Thank God we shall pay off
tomorrow night! Wenches everywhere, above decks and below." He
turned to Christian. "Go forward and gather a boat's crew for
Lieutenant Bligh&mdash;there are a few men still sober."</p>

<p>"There's discipline on a man-of-war at sea," he continued; "but
give me a merchant ship in port. The captain's clerk is the only
sober man below. The surgeon...Ah, here he is now!"</p>

<p>Turning to follow Fryer's glance, I saw a head thatched with
thick snow-white hair appearing in the ladderway. Our sawbones had
a wooden leg and a long equine face, red as the wattles of a turkey
cock; even the back of his neck, lined with deep wrinkles like a
tortoise's, was of the same fiery red. His twinkling bright blue
eyes caught sight of the man beside me. Holding to the ladder with
one hand, he waved a half-empty bottle of brandy at us.</p>

<p>"Ahoy there, Mr. Fryer!" he hailed jovially. "Have you seen
Nelson, the botanist? I prescribed a drop of brandy for his
rheumatic leg; it's time he took his medicine."</p>

<p>"He's gone ashore."</p>

<p>The surgeon shook his head with mock regret. "He'll give his
good shillings to some Portsmouth quack, I'll wager. Yet here on
board he might enjoy free and gratis the advice of the most
enlightened medical opinion. Away with all bark and physic!" He
flourished his bottle. "Here is the remedy for nine tenths of human
ills. Aye! Drops of brandy! That's it!" Suddenly, in a mellow,
husky voice, sweet and true, he began to sing:</p>

<pre>
"And Johnny shall have a new bonnet
And Johnny shall go to the fair,
And Johnny shall have a blue ribbon
To tie up his bonny brown hair."
</pre>
With a final flourish of his bottle, our surgeon went hopping down
the ladderway. Fryer stared after him for a moment before he
followed him below. Left to myself in the midst of the uproar on
deck, I looked about me curiously.

<p>Lieutenant Bligh, an old hand in the Navy, was nowhere to be
seen. On the morrow the men would receive two months' wages in
advance, and on the following day we should set sail on a voyage to
the other side of the world, facing the hardships and dangers of
seas still largely unexplored. The <i>Bounty</i> might well be gone
two years or more, and now, on the eve of departure, her crew was
allowed to relax for a day or two of such amusements as sailors
most enjoy.</p>

<p>While I waited for Bligh in the uproar, I diverted myself in
studying the rigging of the <i>Bounty</i>. Born and brought up on
the west coast of England, I had loved the sea from childhood and
lived amongst men who spoke of ships and their qualities as men
gossip of horses elsewhere. The <i>Bounty</i> was ship-rigged, and
to a true landsman her rigging would have seemed a veritable maze
of ropes. But even in my inexperience I knew enough to name her
sails, the different parts of her standing rigging, and most of the
complex system of halliards, lifts, braces, sheets, and other ropes
for the management of sails and yards. She spread two
headsails&mdash;foretopmast-staysail and jib; on fore and main
masts she carried courses, topsails, topgallants, and royals, and
the mizzenmast spread the latter three sails. That American
innovation, the crossjack, had not in those days been introduced.
The crossjack yard was still, as the French say, a <i>vergue
s&egrave;che</i>,&mdash;a barren yard,&mdash;and the
<i>Bounty's</i> driver, though loose at the foot, was of the
gaff-headed type, then superseding the clumsy lateen our ships had
carried on the mizzen for centuries.</p>

<p>As I mused on the <i>Bounty's</i> sails and ropes, asking myself
how this order or that would be given, and wondering how I should
go about obeying were I told to furl a royal or lend a hand at one
of the braces, I felt something of the spell which even the
smallest ship casts over me to this day. For a ship is the noblest
of all man's works&mdash;a cunning fabric of wood, and iron, and
hemp, wonderfully propelled by wings of canvas, and seeming at
times to have the very breath of life. I was craning my neck to
stare aloft when I heard Bligh's voice, harsh and abrupt.</p>

<p>"Mr. Byam!"</p>

<p>I gathered my wits with a start and found Lieutenant Bligh, in
full uniform, at my side. He gave a faint quizzing smile and went
on: "She's small, eh? But a taut little ship&mdash;a taut little
ship!" He made me a sign to follow him over the <i>Bounty's</i>
side.</p>

<p>Our boat's crew, if not strictly sober, were able to row, and
put their hacks into it with a will. We were soon alongside Captain
Courtney's tall seventy-four. The <i>Tigress</i> paid Mr. Bligh the
compliment of piping the side. Side boys in spotless white stood at
attention by the red ropes to the gangway; the boatswain, in full
uniform, blew a slow and solemn salute on his silver whistle as
Bligh's foot touched the deck. Marine sentries stood at attention,
and all was silent save for the mournful piping. We walked aft,
saluting the quarter-deck, where Captain Courtney awaited us.</p>

<p>Courtney and Bligh were old acquaintances; he had been with
Bligh on the <i>Belle Poule</i>, in the stubborn and bloody action
of Dogger Bank six years before. Captain Courtney was a member of a
great family&mdash;a tall, slender officer, with a quizzing glass
and a thin-lipped ironic mouth. He greeted us pleasantly, spoke of
my father, whom he had known more by reputation than otherwise, and
led us to his cabin aft, where a red-coated sentry stood at the
bulkhead, a drawn sword in his hand. It was the first time I had
been in the cabin of a man-of-war, and I gazed about me curiously.
Its floor was the upper gun-deck and its ceiling the poop; so the
apartment seemed very lofty for a ship. The ports were glazed, and
a door aft gave on the stern-walk, with its carvings and gilded
rail, where the captain might take his pleasure undisturbed. But
the cabin itself was furnished with Spartan bareness: a long settee
under the ports, a heavy fixed table, and a few chairs. A lamp
swung in gimbals overhead; there were a telescope in a bracket, a
short shelf of books, and a stand of muskets and cutlasses in a
rack about the mizzenmast. The table was laid for three.</p>

<p>"A glass of sherry with you, Mr. Bligh," said the captain, as a
man handed the glasses on a tray. He smiled at me in his courtly
way, and raised his glass. "To the memory of your father, young
man! We seamen owe him a lasting debt."</p>

<p>As we drank, I heard a great stir and shuffling of feet on deck,
and the distant sound of a drum. Captain Courtney glanced at his
watch, finished his wine, and rose from the settee.</p>

<p>"My apologies. They're flogging a man through the fleet, and I
hear the boats coming. I must read the sentence at the
gangway&mdash;a deuced bore. Make yourselves at home; should you
wish to be spectators, I can recommend the poop."</p>

<p>Next moment he passed the rigid marine at the bulkhead and was
gone. Bligh listened for a moment to the distant drumming, set down
his glass, and beckoned me to follow him. From the quarter-deck a
short ladder led up to the poop, a high point of vantage from which
all that went on was visible. Though the air was crisp, the wind
was the merest cat's-paw and the sun shone in a blue and cloudless
sky.</p>

<p>The order to turn all hands aft to witness punishment was being
piped by the boatswain and shouted by his mates. The marines, with
muskets and side-arms, were hastening aft to fall in before us on
the poop. Captain Courtney and his lieutenants stood on the weather
quarter-deck, and the junior officers were gathered to leeward of
them. The doctor and purser stood further to leeward, under the
break of the poop, behind the boatswain and his mates. The ship's
company was gathered along the lee bulwarks&mdash;some, to see
better, standing in the boats or on the booms. A tall ninety-eight
and a third-rate like the <i>Tigress</i> lay at anchor close by,
and I saw that their ports and bulwarks were crowded with silent
men.</p>

<p>The half-minute bell began to sound, and the noise of drumming
grew louder&mdash;the doleful tattoo of the rogue's march. Then,
around the bows of the <i>Tigress</i>, came a procession I shall
never forget.</p>

<p>In the lead, rowed slowly in time to the nervous beat of the
drum, came the longboat of a near-by ship. Her surgeon and
master-at-arms stood beside the drummer; just aft of them a human
figure was huddled in a posture I could not make out at first.
Behind the longboat, and rowing in time to the same doleful music,
came a boat from every ship of the fleet, manned with marines to
attend the punishment. I heard an order "Way enough!" and as the
rowing ceased the longboat drifted to a halt by the gangway. I
glanced down over the rail. My breath seemed to catch in my throat,
and without knowing that I spoke, I exclaimed softly, "Oh, my God!"
Mr. Bligh gave me a sidelong glance and one of his slight, grim
smiles.</p>

<p>The huddled figure in the bows of the boat was that of a
powerful man of thirty or thirty-five. He was stripped to his wide
sailor's trousers of duck, and his bare arms were bronzed and
tattooed. Stockings had been bound around his wrists, which were
stoutly lashed to a capstan bar. His thick yellow hair was in
disorder and I could not see his face, for his head hung down over
his chest. His trousers, the thwart on which he lay huddled, and
the frames and planking of the boat on either side of him were
blotched and spattered with black blood. Blood I had seen before;
it was the man's back that made me catch my breath. From neck to
waist the cat-o'-nine-tails had laid the bones bare, and the flesh
hung in blackened, tattered strips.</p>

<p>Captain Courtney sauntered placidly across the deck to glance
down at the hideous spectacle below. The surgeon in the boat bent
over the mutilated, seized-up body, straightened his back, and
looked at Courtney by the gangway.</p>

<p>"The man is dead, sir," he said solemnly. A murmur faint as a
stir of air in the treetops came from the men crowded on the booms.
The Captain of the <i>Tigress</i> folded his arms and turned his
head slightly with raised eyebrows. He made a gallant figure, with
his sword, his rich laced uniform, his cocked hat and powdered
queue. In the tense silence which followed he turned to the surgeon
again.</p>

<p>"Dead," he said lightly, in his cultivated drawl. "Lucky devil!
Master-at-arms!" The warrant officer at the doctor's side sprang to
attention and pulled off his hat. "How many are due?"</p>

<p>"Two dozen, sir."</p>

<p>Courtney strolled back to his place on the weather side and took
from his first lieutenant's hand a copy of the Articles of War. As
he swept off his cocked hat gracefully and held it over his heart,
every man on the ship uncovered in respect to the King's
commandments. Then, in his clear, drawling voice, the captain read
the Article which prescribes the punishment for striking an officer
of His Majesty's Navy. One of the boatswain's mates was untying a
red baize bag, from which he drew out the red-handled cat, eyeing
it uncertainly, with frequent glances to windward. The captain
concluded his reading, replaced his hat, and caught the man's eye.
Again I heard the faint sighing murmur forward, and again deep
silence fell before Courtney's glance. "Do your duty," he ordered
calmly; "two dozen, I believe."</p>

<p>"Two dozen it is, sir," said the boatswain's mate in a hollow
voice as he walked slowly to the side. There were clenched jaws and
gleaming eyes among the men forward, but the silence was so
profound that I could hear the faint creak of blocks aloft as the
braces swayed in the light air.</p>

<p>I could not turn my eyes away from the boatswain's mate,
climbing slowly down the ship's side. If the man had shouted aloud,
he could not have expressed more clearly the reluctance he felt. He
stepped into the boat, and as he moved among the men on the thwarts
they drew back with set stern faces. At the capstan bar, he
hesitated and looked up uncertainly. Courtney had sauntered to the
bulwarks and was gazing down with folded arms.</p>

<p>"Come! Do your duty!" he ordered, with the air of a man whose
dinner is growing cold.</p>

<p>The man with the cat drew its tails through the fingers of his
left hand, raised his arm, and sent them whistling down on the poor
battered corpse. I turned away, giddy and sick. Bligh stood by the
rail, a hand on his hip, watching the scene below as a man might
watch a play indifferently performed. The measured blows
continued&mdash;each breaking the silence like a pistol shot. I
counted them mechanically for what seemed an age, but the end came
at last&mdash;twenty-two, a pause, twenty-three...twenty-four. I
heard a word of command; the marines fell out and trooped down the
poop ladder. Eight bells struck. There were a stir and bustle on
the ship, and I heard the boatswain piping the long-drawn, cheery
call to dinner.</p>

<p>When we sat down to dine, Courtney seemed to have dismissed the
incident from his mind. He tossed off a glass of sherry to Bligh's
health, and tasted his soup. "Cold!" he remarked ruefully.
"Hardships of a seaman's life, eh, Bligh?"</p>

<p>His guest took soup with a relish, and sounds better fitted to
the forecastle than aft, for his manners at table were coarse.
"Damme!" he said. "We fared worse aboard the old <i>Poule!</i>"</p>

<p>"But not in Tahiti, I'll wager. I hear you are to pay the Indian
ladies of the South Sea another call."</p>

<p>"Aye, and a long one. We shall be some months in getting our
load of breadfruit trees."</p>

<p>"I heard of your voyage in Town. Cheap food for the West Indian
slaves, eh? I wish I were sailing with you."</p>

<p>"By God, I wish you were! I could promise you some sport."</p>

<p>"Are the Indian women as handsome as Cook painted them?"</p>

<p>"Indeed they are, if you've no prejudice against a brown skin.
They are wonderfully clean in person, and have enough sensibility
to attract a fastidious man. Witness Sir Joseph; he declares that
there are no such women in the world!"</p>

<p>Our host sighed romantically. "Say no more! Say no more! I can
see you, like a Bashaw under the palms, in the midst of a harem the
Sultan himself might envy!"</p>

<p>Still sickened by what I had seen, I was doing my best to make a
pretense of eating, silent while the older men talked. Bligh was
the first to mention the flogging.</p>

<p>"What had the man done?" he asked.</p>

<p>Captain Courtney set down his glass of claret and glanced up
absently. "Oh, the fellow who was flogged," he said. "He was one of
Captain Allison's foretopmen, on the <i>Unconquerable</i>. And a
smart hand, they say. He was posted for desertion, and then
Allison, who remembered his face, saw him stepping out of a public
house in Portsmouth. The man tried to spring away and Allison
seized him by the arm. Damme! Good topmen don't grow on every
hedge! Well, this insolent fellow blacked Allison's eye, just as a
file of marines passed. They made him prisoner, and you saw the
rest. Odd! We were only the fifth ship; eight dozen did for him.
But Allison has a boatswain's mate who's an artist, they
say&mdash;left-handed, so he lays them on crisscross, and strong as
an ox."</p>

<p>Bligh listened with interest to Courtney's words, and nodded
approvingly. "Struck his captain, eh?" he remarked. "By God! He
deserved all he got, and more! No laws are more just than those
governing the conduct of men at sea."</p>

<p>"Is there any need of such cruelty?" I asked, unable to keep
silent. "Why did they not hang the poor fellow and have done with
it?"</p>

<p>"Poor fellow?" Captain Courtney turned to me with eyebrows
raised. "You have much to learn, my lad. A year or two at sea will
harden him, eh, Bligh?"</p>

<p>"I'll see to that," said the Captain of the <i>Bounty</i>. "No,
Mr. Byam, you must waste no sympathy on rascals of that
stripe."</p>

<p>"And remember," put in Courtney, with a manner of friendly
admonishment, "remember, as Mr. Bligh says, that no laws are more
just than those governing the conduct of men at sea. Not only just,
but necessary; discipline must be preserved, on a merchantman as
well as on a man-of-war, and mutiny and piracy suppressed."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bligh, "our sea law is stern, but it has the
authority of centuries. And it has grown more humane with time," he
continued, not without a trace of regret. "Keel-hauling has been
abolished, save among the French, and a captain no longer has the
right to condemn and put to death one of his crew."</p>

<p>Still agitated by the shock of what I had seen, I ate little and
took more wine than was my custom, sitting in silence for the most
part, while the two officers gossiped, sailor-like, as to the
whereabouts of former friends, and spoke of Admiral Parker, and the
fight at Dogger Bank. It was mid-afternoon when Bligh and I were
pulled back to the <i>Bounty</i>. The tide was low, and I saw a
boat aground on a flat some distance off, while a party of men dug
a shallow grave in the mud. They were burying the body of the poor
fellow who had been flogged through the fleet&mdash;burying him
below tide mark, in silence, and without religious rites.</p>

<h2><a name="c3" id="c3"></a>CHAPTER III.&mdash;AT SEA</h2>

<p>At daybreak on the twenty-eighth of November we got sail on the
<i>Bounty</i> and worked down to St. Helen's, where we dropped
anchor. For nearly a month we were detained there and at Spithead
by contrary winds; it was not until the twenty-third of December
that we set sail down the Channel with a fair wind.</p>

<p>A month sounds an age to be crowded with more than forty other
men on board a small vessel at anchor most of the time, but I was
making the acquaintance of my shipmates, and so keen on learning my
new duties that the days were all too short. The <i>Bounty</i>
carried six midshipmen, and, since we had no schoolmaster, as is
customary on a man-of-war, Lieutenant Bligh and the master divided
the duty of instructing us in trigonometry, nautical astronomy, and
navigation. I shared with Stewart and Young the advantage of
learning navigation under Bligh, and in justice to an officer whose
character in other respects was by no means perfect, I must say
that there was no finer seaman and navigator afloat at the time.
Both of my fellow midshipmen were men grown: George Stewart of a
good family in the Orkneys, a young man of twenty-three or four,
and a seaman who had made several voyages before this: and Edward
Young, a stout, salty-looking fellow, with a handsome face marred
by the loss of nearly all his front teeth. Both of them were
already very fair navigators, and I was hard put to it not to earn
the reputation of a dunce.</p>

<p>The boatswain, Mr. Cole, and his mate, James Morrison,
instructed me in seamanship. Cole was an old-style Navy salt,
bronzed, taciturn, and pigtailed, with a profound knowledge of his
work and little other knowledge of any kind. Morrison was very
different&mdash;a man of good birth, he had been a midshipman, and
had shipped aboard the <i>Bounty</i> because of his interest in the
voyage. He was a first-rate seaman and navigator; a dark, slender,
intelligent man of thirty or thereabouts, cool in the face of
danger, not given to oaths, and far above his station on board.
Morrison did not thrash the men to their work, delivering blows
impartially in the manner of a boatswain's mate; he carried a colt,
a piece of knotted rope, to be sure, but it was only used on
obvious malingerers, or when Bligh shouted to him: "Start that
man!"</p>

<p>There were much irritation and grumbling at the continued bad
weather, but at last, on the evening of the twenty-second of
December, the sky cleared and the wind shifted to the eastward. It
was still dark next morning when I heard the boatswain's pipe and
Morrison's call: "All hands! Turn out and save a clue! Out or down
here! Rise and shine! Out or down there! Lash and carry!"</p>

<p>The stars were bright when I came on deck, and the grey glimmer
of dawn was in the East. For three weeks we had had strong
southwesterly winds, with rain and fog; now the air was sharp with
frost, and a strong east wind blew in gusts off the coast of
France. Lieutenant Bligh was on the quarter-deck with Mr. Fryer,
the master; Christian and Elphinstone, the master's mates, were
forward among the men. There was a great bustle on deck and the
ship rang with the piping of the bos'n's whistle. I heard the
shouting of the men at the windlass, and Christian's voice above
the din: "Hove short, sir!"</p>

<p>"Loose the topsails!" came from Fryer, and Christian passed the
order on. My station was the mizzen-top, and in a twinkling we had
the gaskets off and the small sail sheeted home. The knots in the
gaskets were stiff with frost, and the men setting the fore-topsail
were slow at their work. Bligh glanced aloft impatiently.</p>

<p>"What are you doing there?" he shouted angrily. "Are you all
asleep, foretop? The main-topmen are off the yard! Look alive, you
crawling caterpillars!"</p>

<p>The topsails filled and the yards were braced up sharp; the
<i>Bounty</i> broke out her own anchor as she gathered way on the
larboard tack. She was smartly manned in spite of Bligh's
complaints, but he was on edge, for a thousand critical eyes
watched our departure from the ships at anchor closer inshore. With
a "Yo! Heave ho!" the anchor came up and was tatted.</p>

<p>Then it was: "Loose the forecourse!" and presently, as she began
to heel to the gusts: "Get the mainsail on her!" There was a
thunder of canvas and a wild rattling of blocks. When the brace was
hove short, Bligh himself roared: "Board the main tack!" Little by
little, with a mighty chorus at the windlass: "Heave ho! Heave and
pawl! Yo, heave, hearty, ho!" the weather clew of the sail came
down to the waterway. Heeling well to starboard, the bluff-bowed
little ship tore through the sheltered water, on her way to the
open sea.</p>

<p>The sun rose in a cloudless sky&mdash;a glorious winter's
morning, clear, cold, and sparkling. I stood by the bulwarks as we
flew down the Solent, my breath trailing off like thin smoke.
Presently we sped through the Needles and the <i>Bounty</i> headed
away to sea, going like a race horse, with topgallants set.</p>

<p>That night the wind increased to a strong gale, with a heavy
sea, but on the following day the weather moderated, permitting us
to keep our Christmas cheerfully. Extra grog was served out, and
the mess cooks were to be heard whistling as they seeded the
raisins for duff, not, as a landsman might suppose, from the
prospect of good cheer, but in order to prove to their messmates
that the raisins were not going into their mouths.</p>

<p>I was still making the acquaintance of my shipmates at this
time. The men of the <i>Bounty</i> had been attracted by the
prospect of a voyage to the South Sea, or selected for their
stations by the master or Bligh himself. Our fourteen able-bodied
seamen were true salts, not the scum of the taverns and jails
impressed to man so many of His Majesty's ships; the officers were
nearly all men of experience and tried character, and even our
botanist, Mr. Nelson, had been recommended by Sir Joseph Banks
because of his former voyage to Tahiti under Captain Cook. Mr.
Bligh might have had a hundred midshipmen had he obliged all those
who applied for a place in the <i>Bounty's</i> berth; as it was,
there were six of us, though the ship's establishment provided for
only two. Stewart and Young were seamen and pleasant fellows
enough; Hallet was a sickly-looking boy of fifteen with a shifty
eye and a weak, peevish mouth; Tinkler, Mr. Fryer's brother-in-law,
was a year younger, though he had been to sea before&mdash;a monkey
of a lad, whose continual scrapes kept him at the masthead half the
time. Hayward, the handsome, sulky boy I had met when I first set
foot in the berth, was only, sixteen, but big and strong for his
age. He was something of a bully and aspired to be cock of the
berth, since he had been two years at sea aboard a
seventy-four.</p>

<p>I shared with Hayward, Stewart, and Young a berth on the lower
deck. In this small space the four of us swung our hammocks at
night and had our mess, using a chest for a table and other chests
for seats. On consideration of a liberal share of our grog,
received each Saturday night, Alexander Smith, able-bodied, acted
as our hammock man, and for a lesser sum of the same ship's
currency, Thomas Ellison, the youngest of the seamen, filled the
office of mess boy. Mr. Christian was caterer to the midshipmen's
mess; like the others, I had paid him five pounds on joining the
ship, and he had laid out the money in a supply of potatoes,
onions, Dutch cheeses (for making that midshipman's dish called
"crab"), tea, coffee, and sugar, and other small luxuries. These
private stores enabled us to live well for several weeks, though a
more villainous cook than young Tom Ellison would be impossible to
find. As for drink, the ship's allowance was so liberal that
Christian made no special provision for us. For a month or more
every man aboard received a gallon of beer each day, and when that
was gone, a pint of fiery white <i>mistela</i> wine from
Spain&mdash;the wine our seamen love and call affectionately "Miss
Taylor." And when the last of the wine was gone we fell back on an
ample supply of the sailor's sheet anchor&mdash;grog. We had a
wondrous fifer on board&mdash;a half-blind Irishman named Michael
Byrne. He had managed to conceal his blindness till the
<i>Bounty</i> was at sea, when it became apparent, much to Mr.
Bligh's annoyance. But when he struck up "Nancy Dawson" on the
first day he piped the men to grog, his blindness was forgotten. He
could put more trills and runs into that lively old tune than any
man of us had heard before a cheeriness in keeping with this
happiest hour of the seaman's day.</p>

<p>We lost a good part of our beer in a strong easterly gale that
overtook the <i>Bounty</i> the day after Christmas. Several casks
went adrift from their lashings and were washed overboard when a
great sea broke over the ship; the same wave stove in all three of
our boats and nearly carried them away. I was off watch at the
time, and below, diverting myself in the surgeon's cabin on the
orlop, aft. It was a close, stinking little den, below the water
line&mdash;reeking of the bilges and lit by a candle that burned
blue for lack of air. But that mattered nothing to Old Bacchus. Our
sawbones's name was Thomas Huggan and it was so inscribed on the
ship's articles, but he was known as Old Bacchus to all our
company. His normal state was what sailors call "in the wind" or
"shaking a cloth," and the signal that he had passed his normal
state earned him the name by which all hands on the <i>Bounty</i>
knew him. When he had indiscreetly added a glass of brandy or a tot
of grog to the carefully measured supply of spirits demanded at
close intervals by a stomach which must have been copper-sheathed,
it was his custom to rise, balancing himself on his starboard leg,
place a hand between the third and fourth buttons of his waistcoat,
and recite with comic gravity a verse which begins:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>Bacchus must now his power resign.</blockquote>

<p>With his wooden leg, his fiery face, snow-white hair, and rakish
blue eyes, Old Bacchus seemed the veritable archetype of naval
surgeons. He had been afloat so long that he could scarcely
recollect the days when he had lived ashore, and viewed with
apprehension the prospect of retirement. He preferred salt beef to
the finest steak or chop to be obtained ashore, and confided to me
one day that it was almost impossible for him to sleep in a bed. A
cannon ball had carried away his larboard leg when his ship was
exchanging broadsides, yardarm to yardarm, with the <i>Ranger</i>,
and he had been made prisoner by John Paul Jones.</p>

<p>The cronies of Old Bacchus were Mr. Nelson, the botanist, and
Peckover, the <i>Bounty's</i> gunner. The duties of a gunner,
onerous enough on board a man-of-war, were of the very lightest on
our ship, and Peckover&mdash;a jovial fellow who loved a song and a
glass dearly&mdash;had some leisure for conviviality. Mr. Nelson
was a quiet, elderly man with iron-grey hair. Though devoted to the
study of plants, he seemed to derive great pleasure from the
surgeon's company, and could spin a. yarn with the best when in the
mood. The great event in his life had been his voyage to the South
Sea with Captain Cook, whose memory he revered.</p>

<p>Mr. Nelson's cabin was forward of the surgeon's, separated from
it by the cabin of Samuel, the captain's clerk, and he was to be
found more often in the surgeon's cabin than in his own. All of the
cabins were provided with standing bed places, built in by the
carpenters at Deptford, but Bacchus preferred to sling a hammock at
night, and used his bed as a settee and the capacious locker under
it as a private spirit room. The cabin was scarcely more than six
feet by seven; the bed occupied nearly half of this space, and
opposite, under the hammock battens, were three small casks of
wine, as yet unbroached. On one of them a candle guttered and
burned blue.</p>

<p>Another cask served as a seat for me, and Bacchus and Nelson sat
side by side on the bed. Each man held a pewter pint of
flip&mdash;beer strongly laced with rum. The ship was on the
larboard tack and making heavy weather of it, so that at times my
cask threatened to slide from under me, but the two men on the
settee seemed to give the weather no thought.</p>

<p>"A first-rate man, Purcell!" remarked the surgeon, glancing down
admiringly at his new wooden leg; "a better ship's carpenter never
swung an adze! My other leg was most damnably uncomfortable, but
this one's like my own flesh and bone! Mr. Purcell's health!" He
took a long pull at the flip and smacked his lips. "You're a lucky
man, Nelson! Should anything happen to your underpinning, you've me
to saw off the old leg and Purcell to make you a better one!"</p>

<p>Nelson smiled. "Very kind, I'm sure," he said; "but I hope I
shall not have to trouble you."</p>

<p>"I hope not, my dear fellow&mdash;I hope not! But never dread an
amputation. With a pint of rum, a well-stropped razor, and a
crosscut saw, I'd have your leg off before you knew it. Paul
Jones's American surgeon did the trick for me.</p>

<p>"Let's see&mdash;it must have been in seventy-eight. I was on
the old <i>Drake</i>, Captain Burden, and we were on the lookout
for Paul Jones's <i>Ranger</i> at the time. Then we learned that
she was hove-to off the mouth of Belfast Lough. An extraordinary
affair, begad! We actually had sight-seers on board&mdash;one of
them was an officer of the Inniskilling Fusileers in full uniform.
We moved out slowly and came up astern of the American ship. Up
went our colours and we hailed: "What ship is that?" 'American
Continental ship <i>Ranger!</i>' roared the Yankee master, as his
own colours went up. 'Come on&mdash;we're waiting for you!' Next
moment both ships let go their broadsides...Good God!"</p>

<p>The <i>Bounty</i> staggered with the shock of a great sea which
broke into her at that moment. "Up with you, Byam!" ordered the
surgeon; and, as I sprang out of his cabin toward the ladderway, I
heard, above the creaking and straining of the ship and the roar of
angry water, a faint shouting for all hands on deck. Then I found
myself in an uproar and confusion very strange after the peace of
the surgeon's snuggery.</p>

<p>Bligh stood by the mizzenmast, beside Fryer, who was bawling
orders to his mates. They were shortening sail to get the ship
hove-to. The men at the clew lines struggled with might and main to
hoist the stubborn thundering canvas to the yards.</p>

<p>My own task, with two other midshipmen, was to furl the mizzen
topsail&mdash;a small sail, but far from easy to subdue at such a
time. The men below brailed up the driver and made fast the vangs
of its gaff. Presently the <i>Bounty</i> was hove-to, all snug on
the larboard tack, under reefed fore and main topsails.</p>

<p>The great wave which had boarded us left destruction in its
wake. All three of our boats were stove in; the casks of beer which
had been lashed on deck were nowhere to be seen; and the stern of
the ship so damaged that the cabin was filled with water, which
leaked into the bread room below, spoiling a large part of our
stock of bread.</p>

<p>In latitude 39&deg;N. the gale abated, the sun shone out, and we
made all sail for Teneriffe with a fine northerly wind. On the
fourth of January we spoke a French merchant vessel, bound for
Mauritius, which let go her topgallant sheets in salute. The next
morning we saw the island of Teneriffe to the southwest of us,
about twelve leagues distant, but it fell calm near the land and we
were a day and a night working up to the road of Santa Cruz, where
we anchored in twenty-five fathoms, close to a Spanish packet and
an American brig.</p>

<p>For five days we lay at anchor in the road, and it was here that
the seeds of discontent, destined to be the ruin of the voyage,
were sown among the <i>Bounty's</i> people. As there was a great
surf on the beach, Lieutenant Bligh bargained with the shore boats
to bring off our water and supplies, and kept his own men busy from
morning to night repairing the mischief the storm had done our
ship. This occasioned much grumbling in the forecastle, as some of
the sailors had hoped to be employed in the ship's boats, which
would have enabled them at least to set foot on the island and to
obtain some of the wine for which it is famous, said to be little
inferior to the best London Madeira.</p>

<p>During our sojourn the allowance of salt beef was stopped, and
fresh beef, obtained on shore, issued instead. The <i>Bounty's</i>
salt beef was the worst I have ever met with at sea, but the beef
substituted for. it in Teneriffe was worse still. The men declared
that it had been cut from the carcasses of dead horses or mules,
and complained to the master that it was unfit for food. Fryer
informed Bligh of the complaint; the captain flew into a passion
and swore that the men should eat the fresh beef or nothing at all.
The result was that most of it was thrown overboard&mdash;a sight
which did nothing to soothe Bligh's temper.</p>

<p>I was fortunate enough to have a run ashore, for Bligh took me
with him one day to wait upon the governor, the Marquis de
Branchefort&agrave;&eacute;. With the governor's permission Mr.
Nelson ranged the hills every day in search of plants and natural
curiosities, but his friend the surgeon only appeared on deck once
during the five days we lay at anchor. Old Bacchus had ordered a
monstrous supply of brandy for himself&mdash;enough to do the very
god of wine, his namesake, for a year. Not trusting the shore boats
with such precious freight, he had obtained the captain's
permission to send the small cutter to the pier, and when a man
went below to inform him that his brandy was alongside, the surgeon
came stumping to the ladderway and clambered on deck. The cutter
was down to the gunwales with her load; as there was a high swell
running, Old Bacchus stood by the bulwarks anxiously. "Easy with
it!" he ordered with tender solicitude. "Easy now! A glass of grog
all around if you break nothing!" When the last of the small casks
was aboard and had been sent below, the surgeon heaved a sigh. I
was standing near by and saw him glance at the land for the first
time. He caught my eye. "One island's as like another as two peas
in a pod," he remarked indifferently, pulling out a handkerchief to
mop his fiery face.</p>

<p>When we sailed from Teneriffe, Bligh divided the people into
three watches, making Christian acting lieutenant, and giving him
charge of the third watch. Bligh had known him for some years in
the West India trade, and believed himself to be Christian's friend
and benefactor. His friendship took the form of inviting Christian
to sup or dine one day, and cursing him in the coarsest manner
before the men the next; but in this case he did him a real
service, since it was ten to one that, if all went well on the
voyage, the appointment would be confirmed by the Admiralty, and
Christian would find himself the holder of His Majesty's
commission. He now rated as a gentleman, with the midshipmen and
Bligh; and Fryer was provided with a grievance both against the
captain, and&mdash;such is human nature&mdash;against his former
subordinate.</p>

<p>Nor were grievances wanting during our passage from Teneriffe to
Cape Horn. The people's food on British ships is always bad and
always scanty&mdash;a fact which in later days caused so many of
our seamen to desert to American vessels. But on the <i>Bounty</i>
the food was of poorer quality, and issued in scantier quantities,
than any man of us had seen before. When Bligh called the ship's
company aft to read the order appointing Christian acting
lieutenant, he also informed them that, as the length of the voyage
was uncertain, and the season so far advanced that it was doubtful
whether we should be able to make our way around Cape Horn, it
seemed necessary to reduce the allowance of bread to two thirds of
the usual amount. Realizing the need for economy, the men received
this cheerfully, but continued to grumble about the salt beef and
pork.</p>

<p>We carried no purser. Bligh filled the office himself, assisted
by Samuel, his clerk&mdash;a smug, tight-lipped little man, of a
Jewish cast of countenance, who was believed, not without reason,
to be the captain's "narker" or spy among the men. He was heartily
disliked by all hands, and it was observed that the man who showed
his dislike for Mr. Samuel too openly was apt to find himself in
trouble with Lieutenant Bligh. It was Samuel's task to issue the
provisions to the cooks of the messes; each time a cask of salt
meat was broached, the choicest pieces were reserved for the cabin,
and the remainder, scarcely lit for human food, issued out to the
messes without being weighed. Samuel would call out "Four pounds,"
and mark the amount down in his book, when anyone could perceive
that the meat would not have weighed three:</p>

<p>Seamen regard meanness in their own kind with the utmost
contempt, and that great rarity in the Service, a mean officer, is
looked upon with loathing by his men. They can put up with a harsh
captain, but nothing will drive British seamen to mutiny faster
than a captain suspected of lining his pockets at their
expense.</p>

<p>While the <i>Bounty</i> was still in the northeast trades, an
incident occurred which gave us reason to suspect Bligh of meanness
of this kind. The weather was fine, and one morning the main hatch
was raised and our stock of cheeses brought up on deck to air.
Bligh missed no detail of the management of his ship; he displayed
in such matters a smallness of mind scarcely in accord with his
commission. This unwillingness to trust those under him to perform
their duties is apt to be the defect of the officer risen from the
ranks,&mdash;or "come in through the hawse-hole," as seamen
say,&mdash;and is the principal reason why such officers are rarely
popular with their men.</p>

<p>Bligh stood by Hillbrandt, the cooper, while he started the
hoops on our casks of cheese and knocked out the heads. Two
cheeses, of about fifty pounds weight, were found to be missing
from one of the casks, and Bligh flew into one of his passions of
rage.</p>

<p>"Stolen, by God!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will recollect, sir," Hillbrandt made bold to say,
"that while we were in Deptford the cask was opened by your order
and the cheeses carried ashore."</p>

<p>"You insolent scoundrel! Hold your tongue!"</p>

<p>Christian and Fryer happened to be on deck at the time, and
Bligh included them in the black scowl he gave the men near by. "A
damned set of thieves," he went on. "You're all in collusion
against me&mdash;officers and men. But I'll tame you&mdash;by God,
I will!" He turned to the cooper. "Another word from you and I'll
have you seized up and flogged to the bone." He turned aft on his
heel and bawled down the ladderway. "Mr. Samuel! Come on deck this
instant."</p>

<p>Samuel came trotting up to his master obsequiously, and Bligh
went on: "Two of the cheeses have been stolen. See that the
allowance is stopped&mdash;from the officers too, mind
you&mdash;until the deficiency is made good."</p>

<p>I could see that Fryer was deeply offended, though he said
nothing at the time; as for Christian,&mdash;a man of
honour,&mdash;his feelings were not difficult to imagine. The men
had a pretty clear idea of which way the wind blew by this time,
and on the next banyan day, when butter alone was served out, they
refused it, saying that to accept butter without cheese would be a
tacit acknowledgment of the theft. John Williams, one of the
seamen, declared publicly in the forecastle that he had carried the
two cheeses to Mr. Bligh's house, with a cask of vinegar and some
other things which were sent up in a boat from Long Reach.</p>

<p>As the private stocks of provisions obtained in Spithead now
began to run out, all hands went "from grub galore to the King's
own," as seamen say. Our bread, which was only beginning to breed
maggots, was fairly good, though it needed teeth better than mine
to eat the central "reefer's nut"; but our salt meat was
unspeakably bad. Meeting Alexander Smith one morning when he was
cook to his mess, I was shown a piece of it fresh from the
cask&mdash;a dark, stony, unwholesome-looking lump, glistening with
salt.</p>

<p>"Have a look, Mr. Byam," he said. "What'll it be, I wonder? Not
beef or pork, that's certain! I mind one day on the old
<i>Antelope</i>&mdash;two years ago, that was&mdash;the cooper
found three horseshoes in the bottom of a cask!" He shook his
pigtail back over his shoulder and shifted a great quid of tobacco
to his starboard cheek. "You've seen the victualing yards in
Portsmouth, sir? Pass that way any night, and you'll hear the dogs
bark and the horses neigh! And I'll tell you something else you
young gentlemen don't know." He glanced up and down the deck
cautiously and then whispered: "It's as much as a black man's life
is worth to pass that way by night! They'd pop him into a cask like
that!" He snapped his fingers impressively.</p>

<p>Smith was a great admirer of Old Bacchus, whom he had known on
other ships, and a few days later he handed me a little wooden box.
"For the surgeon, sir," he said. "Will you give it to him?"</p>

<p>It was a snuffbox, curiously wrought of some dark, reddish wood,
like mahogany, and very neatly fitted with a lid; a handsome hit of
work, carved and polished with a seaman's skill. I found leisure to
visit the surgeon the same evening.</p>

<p>Christian's watch was on duty at the time. Young Tinkler and I
were in Mr. Fryer's watch, and the third watch had been placed in
charge of Mr. Peckover, a short, powerful man of forty or
forty-five, who could scarcely remember a time when he had not been
at sea. His good-humoured face had been blackened by the West
Indian sun, and his arms were covered with tattooing.</p>

<p>I found Peckover with the doctor and Nelson&mdash;squeezed
together on the settee.</p>

<p>"Come in," cried the surgeon. "Wait a bit, my lad&mdash;I think
I can make a place for you."</p>

<p>He sprang up with surprising agility and pushed a small cask
into the doorway. Peckover held the spigot open while the wine
poured frothing into a pewter pint. I delivered the snuffbox before
I sat down on my cask, pint in hand.</p>

<p>"From Smith, you say?" asked the surgeon. "Very handsome of him!
Very handsome indeed! I remember Smith well on the old
<i>Antelope</i>&mdash;eh, Peckover? I have a recollection that I
used to treat him to a drop of grog now and then. And why not, I
say! A thirsty man goes straight to my heart." He glanced
complacently about his cabin, packed to the hammock battens with
small casks of spirits and wine. "Thank God that neither I nor my
friends shall go thirsty on this voyage!"</p>

<p>Nelson stretched out his hand for the snuffbox and examined it
with interest. "I shall always marvel," he remarked, "at the
ingenuity of our seamen. This would be a credit to any craftsman
ashore, with all the tools of his trade. And a fine bit of wood,
handsomely polished, too! Mahogany, no doubt, though the grain
seems different."</p>

<p>Bacchus looked at Peckover quizzically, and the gunner returned
the look, grinning.</p>

<p>"Wood?" said the surgeon. "Well, I have heard it called that,
and worse. Wood that once bellowed&mdash;aye, and neighed and
harked, if the tales be true. In plain English, my dear Nelson,
your mahogany is old junk, more politely called salt beef&mdash;His
Majesty's own!"</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" exclaimed Nelson, examining the snuffbox in real
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Aye, salt beef! Handsome as any mahogany and quite as durable.
Why, it had been proposed to sheathe our West India frigates with
it&mdash;a material said to defy the attacks of the toredo
worm!"</p>

<p>I took the little box from Nelson's hand, to inspect it with a
new interest. "Well, I'm damned!" I thought.</p>

<p>Old Bacchus had rolled up his sleeve and was pouring a train of
snuff along his shaven and polished forearm. With a loud sniffing
sound it disappeared up his nose. He sneezed, blew his nose
violently on an enormous blue handkerchief, and filled his tankard
with <i>mistela</i>.</p>

<p>"A glass of wine with you gentlemen!" he remarked, and poured
the entire pint down his throat without taking breath. Mr. Peckover
glanced at his friend admiringly.</p>

<p>"Aye, Peckover," said the surgeon, catching his eye, "nothing
like a nip of salt beef to give a man a thirst. Let the cook keep
his slush. Give me a bit of the lean, well soaked and boiled, and
you can have all the steaks and cutlets ashore. Begad! Just
suppose, now, that we were all wrecked on a desert island, without
a scrap to eat. I'd pull out my snuffbox and have one meal, at any
rate, while the rest of you went hungry!"</p>

<p>"So you would, surgeon, so you would," said the gunner in his
rumbling voice, grinning from ear to ear.</p>

<h2><a name="c4" id="c4"></a>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;TYRANNY</h2>

<p>One sultry afternoon, before we picked up the southeast trades,
Bligh sent his servant to bid me sup with him. Since the great
cabin was taken up with our breadfruit garden, the captain messed
on the lower deck, in an apartment on the larboard side, extending
from the hatch to the bulkhead abaft the mainmast. I dressed myself
with some care, and, going aft, found that Christian was my fellow
guest. The surgeon and Fryer messed regularly with Bligh, but Old
Bacchus had excused himself this evening.</p>

<p>There was a fine show of plate on the captain's table, but when
the dishes were uncovered I saw that Bligh fared little better than
his men. We had salt beef, in plenty for once, and the pick of the
cask, bad butter, and worse cheese, from which the long red worms
had been hand-picked, a supply of salted cabbage, believed to
prevent scurvy, and a dish heaped with the mashed pease seamen call
"dog's body."</p>

<p>Mr. Bligh, though temperate in the use of wine, attacked his
food with more relish than most officers would care to display.
Fryer was a rough, honest old seaman, but his manners at table put
the captain's to shame; yet Christian, who had been a mere master's
mate only a few days before, supped fastidiously despite the
coarseness of the food. Christian was on the captain's right, Fryer
on his left, and I sat opposite, facing him. The talk had turned to
the members of the <i>Bounty's</i> company.</p>

<p>"Damn them!" said Bligh, his mouth full of beef and pease, which
he continued to chew rapidly as he spoke. "A lazy, incompetent lot
of scoundrels! God knows a captain has trials enough without being
cursed with such a crew! The dregs of the public houses..." He
swallowed violently and filled his mouth once more. "That fellow I
had flogged yesterday; what was his name, Mr. Fryer?"</p>

<p>"Burkitt," replied the master, a little red in the face.</p>

<p>"Yes, Burkitt, the insolent hound! And they're all as bad. I'm
damned if they know a sheet from a tack!"</p>

<p>"I venture to differ with you, sir," said the master. "I should
call Smith, Quintal, and McCoy first-class seamen, and even
Burkitt, though he was in the wrong..."</p>

<p>"The insolent hound!" repeated Bligh violently, interrupting the
master. "At the slightest report of misconduct, I shall have him
seized up again. Next time it will be four dozen, instead of
two!"</p>

<p>Christian caught my eye as the captain spoke. "If I may express
an opinion, Mr. Bligh," he said quietly, "Burkitt's nature is one
to tame with kindness rather than with blows."</p>

<p>Bligh's short, harsh laugh rang out grimly. "La-di-da, Mr.
Christian! On my word, you should apply for a place as master in a
young ladies' seminary! Kindness, indeed! Well, I'm damned!" He
took up a glass of the reeking ship's water, rinsing his mouth
preparatory to an attack on the sourcrout. "A fine captain you'll
make if you don't heave overboard such ridiculous notions.
Kindness! Our seamen and kindness as well as they and Greek! Fear
is what they <i>do</i> understand! Without that, mutiny and piracy
would be rife on the high seas!"</p>

<p>"Aye," admitted Fryer, as if regretfully. "There is some truth
in that."</p>

<p>Christian shook his head. "I cannot agree," he said courteously.
"Our seamen do not differ from other Englishmen. Some must be ruled
by fear, it is true, but there are others, and finer men, who will
follow a kind, just, and fearless officer to the death."</p>

<p>"Have we any such paragons on board?" asked the captain
sneeringly. "In my opinion, sir," said Christian, speaking in his
light and courteous manner, "we have, and not a few."</p>

<p>"Now, by God! Name one!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Purcell, the carpenter. He..."</p>

<p>This time Bligh laughed long and loud. "Damme!" he exclaimed,
"you're a fine judge of men! That stubborn, thick-headed old rogue!
Kindness...Ah, that's too good!"</p>

<p>Christian flushed, controlling his hot temper with an effort.
"You won't have the carpenter, I see," he said lightly: "then may I
suggest Morrison, sir?"</p>

<p>"Suggest to your heart's content," answered Bligh scornfully.
"Morrison? The gentlemanly boatswain's mate? The sheep masquerading
as a wolf? Kindness? Morrison's too damned kind now!"</p>

<p>"But a fine seaman, sir," put in Fryer gruffly; "he has been a
midshipman, and is a gentleman born."</p>

<p>"I know, I know!" said Bligh in his most offensive way; "and no
higher in my estimation for all that." He turned to me, with what
he meant to be a courteous smile. "Saving your presence, Mr. Byam,
damn all midshipmen, I say! There could be no worse schools than
the berth for the making of sea officers!" He turned to Christian
once more, and his manner changed to an unpleasant truculence.</p>

<p>"As for Morrison, let him take care! I've my eye on him, for I
can see that he spares the cat. A boatswain's mate who was not a
gentleman would have had half the hide off Burkitt's back. Let him
take care, I say! Let him lay on when I give the word or, by God,
I'll have him seized up for a lesson from the boatswain
himself!"</p>

<p>I perceived, as the meal went on, that the captain's mess was
anything but a congenial one. Fryer disliked the captain, and had
not forgotten the incident of the cheeses. Bligh made no secret of
his dislike for the master, whom he often upbraided before the men
on deck; and he felt for Christian a contempt he was at no pains to
conceal.</p>

<p>I was not surprised, a few days later, to learn from Old Bacchus
that Christian and the master had quitted the captain's mess,
leaving Bligh to dine and sup alone. We were south of the line by
this time.</p>

<p>At Teneriffe, we had taken on board a large supply of pumpkins,
which now began to show symptoms of spoiling under the equatorial
sun. As most of them were too large for the use of Bligh's table,
Samuel was ordered to issue them to the men in lieu of bread. The
rate of exchange&mdash;one pound of pumpkin to replace two pounds
of bread&mdash;was considered unfair by the men, and when Bligh was
informed of this he came on deck in a passion and called all hands.
Samuel was then ordered to summon the first man of every mess.</p>

<p>"Now," exclaimed Bligh violently, "let me see who will dare to
refuse the pumpkins, or anything else I order to be served. You
insolent rascals! By God! I'll make you eat grass before I've done
with you!"</p>

<p>Everyone now took the pumpkins, not excepting the officers,
though the amount was so scanty that it was usually thrown together
by the men, the cooks of the different messes drawing lots for the
whole. There was some murmuring, particularly among the officers,
but the grievance might have ended there had not all hands begun to
believe that the casks of beef and pork were short of their weight.
This had been suspected for some time, as Samuel could never be
prevailed on to weigh the meat when opened, and at last the
shortage became so obvious that the people applied to the master,
begging that he would examine into the affair and procure them
redress. Bligh ordered all hands aft at once.</p>

<p>"So you've complained to Mr. Fryer, eh?" he said, shortly and
harshly. "You're not content! Let me tell you, by God, that you'd
better make up your minds to be content! Everything that Mr. Samuel
does is done by my orders, do you understand? My orders! Waste no
more time in complaints, for you will get no redress! I am the only
judge of what is right and wrong. Damn your eyes! I'm tired of you
and your complaints! The first man to complain from now on will be
seized up and flogged."</p>

<p>Perceiving that no redress was to be hoped for before the end of
the voyage, the men resolved to bear their sufferings with
patience, and neither murmured nor complained from that time. But
the officers, though they dared make no open complaints, were less
easily satisfied and murmured frequently among themselves of their
continual state of hunger, which they thought was due to the fact
that the captain and his clerk had profited by the victualing of
the ship. Our allowance of food was so scanty that the men
quarreled fiercely over the division of it in the galley, and when
several men had been hurt it became necessary for the master's mate
of the watch to superintend the division of the food.</p>

<p>About a hundred leagues off the coast of Brazil, the wind
chopped around to north and northwest, and I realized that we had
reached the southern limit of the southeast trades. It was here, in
the region of variable westerlies, that the <i>Bounty</i> was
becalmed for a day or two, and the people employed themselves in
fishing, each mess risking a part of its small allowance of salt
pork in hopes of catching one of the sharks that swam about the
ship.</p>

<p>The landsman turns up his nose at the shark, but, to a sailor
craving fresh meat, the flesh of a shark under ten feet in length
is a veritable luxury. The larger sharks have a strong rank smell,
but the flesh of the small ones, cut into slices like so many
beefsteaks, parboiled first and then broiled with plenty of pepper
and salt, eats very well indeed, resembling codfish in flavour.</p>

<p>I tasted shark for the first time one evening off the Brazilian
coast. It was dead calm; the sails hung slack from the yards, only
moving a little when the ship rolled to a gently northerly swell.
John Mills, the gunner's mate, stood forward abreast of the
windlass, with a heavy line coiled in his hand. He was an old
seaman, one of Christian's watch&mdash;a man of forty or
thereabouts who had served in the West Indies on the
<i>Mediator</i>, Captain Cuthbert Collingwood. I disliked the
man,&mdash;a tall, rawboned, dour old salt,&mdash;but I watched
with interest as he prepared his bait. Two of his messmates stood
by, ready to bear a hand&mdash;Brown, the assistant botanist, and
Norman, the carpenter's mate. The mess had contributed the large
piece of salt pork now going over the side; they shared the risk of
losing the bait without results, as they would share whatever Mills
was fortunate enough to catch. A shark about ten feet long had just
passed under the bows. I craned my neck to watch.</p>

<p>Next moment a small striped fish like a mackerel flashed this
way and that about the bait. "Pilot fish!" cried Norman. "Take
care&mdash;here comes the shark!"</p>

<p>"Damn you!" growled Mills. "Don't dance about like a
monkey&mdash;you'll frighten him off!"</p>

<p>The shark, an ugly yellowish blotch in the blue water, was
rising beneath the bait, and all eyes were on him as he turned on
his side, opened his jaws, and gulped down the piece of pork.
"Hooked, by God!" roared Mills as he hove the line short. "Now, my
hearties, on deck with him!" The line was strong and the messmates
hove with a will; in an instant the shark came struggling over the
bulwarks and thumped down on deck. Mills seized a hatchet and
struck the fish a heavy blow on the snout; next moment six or seven
men were astride of the quivering carcass, knives out and cutting
away for dear life. The spectacle was laughable. Mills, to whom the
head belonged by right of capture, was seated at the forward end;
each of the others, pushing himself as far aft as possible, to
enlarge his cut of shark, was slicing away within an inch of the
next man's rump. There were cries of "Mind what you are about,
there!"</p>

<p>"Take care, else I'll have a slice off your backside!" And in
about three minutes' time the poor fish had been severed into as
many great slices as there had been men bestriding him.</p>

<p>The deck was washed, and Mills was picking up the several slices
into which he had cut his share of the fish, when Mr. Samuel, the
captain's clerk, came strolling forward.</p>

<p>"A fine catch, my good man," he remarked in his patronizing way.
"I must have a slice, eh?"</p>

<p>In common with all of the <i>Bounty's</i> people, Mills disliked
Samuel heartily. The clerk drank neither rum nor wine, and it was
suspected that he hoarded his ration of spirits for sale
ashore.</p>

<p>"So you must have a slice," growled the gunner's mate. "Well, I
must have a glass of grog, and a stiff one, too, if you are to eat
shark to-day."</p>

<p>"Come! Come! My good man," said Samuel pettishly. "You've enough
fish there for a dozen."</p>

<p>"And you've enough grog stowed away for a thousand, by God!"</p>

<p>"It's for the captain's table I want it," said Samuel.</p>

<p>"Then catch him a shark yourself. This is mine. He gets the best
of the bread and the pick of the junk cask as it is."</p>

<p>"You forget yourself, Mills! Come, give me a slice&mdash;that
large one there&mdash;and I'll say nothing."</p>

<p>"Say nothing be damned! Here&mdash;take your slice!" As he
spoke, Mills flung the ten or twelve pounds of raw fish straight at
Samuel's face, with the full strength of a brawny, tattooed arm. He
turned on his heel to go below, growling under his breath.</p>

<p>Mr. Samuel picked himself up from the deck, not forgetting his
slice of shark, and walked slowly aft. The look in his eye boded no
good fortune to the gunner's mate.</p>

<p>The news spread over the ship rapidly, and for the first time
aboard the <i>Bounty</i> Mills found himself a popular man, though
there was little hope that he would escape punishment. As Old
Bacchus put it that night, "The least he can hope for is a
red-checked shirt at the gangway. Samuel's a worm and a dirty worm,
but discipline's discipline, begad!"</p>

<p>I believe that a day will come when flogging will be abolished
on His Majesty's ships. It is an over-brutal punishment, which
destroys a good man's self-respect and makes a bad man worse.
Landsmen have little idea of the savagery of a flogging at the
gangway. The lashes are laid on with the full strength of a
powerful man's arm, with such force that each blow knocks the
breath clean out of the delinquent's body. One blow takes off the
skin and draws blood where each knot falls. Six blows make the
whole back raw. Twelve cut deeply into the flesh and leave it a red
mass, horrible to see. Yet six dozen are a common punishment.</p>

<p>As had been predicted, Mills spent the night in irons. The kind
hearts of our British seamen were evident next morning when I was
told that his messmates had saved their entire allowance of grog
for Mills, to fortify him against the flogging they considered
inevitable. At six bells Mr. Bligh came on deck, and bade Christian
turn the hands aft to witness punishment. The weather had grown
cooler, and the <i>Bounty</i> was slipping southward with all sail
set, before a light northwest breeze. The order was piped and
shouted forward; I joined the assembly of officers aft, while the
people fell in on the booms and along the ship's side. All were
silent.</p>

<p>"Rig the gratings," ordered Mr. Bligh, in his harsh voice.</p>

<p>The carpenter and his mates dragged aft two of the wooden
gratings used to cover the hatches. They placed one flat on the
deck, and the other upright, secured to the bulwarks by the lee
gangway. "The gratings are rigged, sir," reported Purcell, the
carpenter. "John Mills!" said Bligh. "Step forward!"</p>

<p>Flushed with the rum he had taken, and dressed in his best,
Mills stepped out from among his messmates. His unusual smartness
was designed to mollify the punishment, yet there was in his
bearing a trace of defiance. He was a hard man, and he felt that he
had been hardly used.</p>

<p>"Have you anything to say?" asked Bligh of the bare-headed
seaman before him.</p>

<p>"No, sir," growled Mills sullenly.</p>

<p>"Strip!" ordered the captain.</p>

<p>Mills tore off his shirt, flung it to one of his messmates, and
advanced bare-shouldered to the gratings.</p>

<p>"Seize him up," said Bligh.</p>

<p>Norton and Lenkletter, our quartermasters&mdash;old pigtailed
seamen who had performed this office scores of times in the
past&mdash;now advanced with lengths of spun yarn, and lashed
Mills's outstretched wrists to the upright grating.</p>

<p>"Seized up, sir!" reported Norton.</p>

<p>Bligh took off his hat, as did every man on the ship, opened a
copy of the Articles of War, and read in a solemn voice the article
which prescribes the punishments for mutinous conduct. Morrison,
the boatswain's mate, was undoing the red baize bag in which he
kept the cat.</p>

<p>"Three dozen, Mr. Morrison," said Bligh as he finished reading.
"Do your duty!"</p>

<p>Morrison was a kindly, reflective man. I felt for him A that
moment, for I knew that he hated flogging on principle, and must
feel the injustice of this punishment. Yet he would not dare, under
the keen eye of the captain, to lighten the force of his blows.
However unwilling, he was Bligh's instrument.</p>

<p>He advanced to the grating, drew the tails of the cat through
his fingers, flung his arm back, and struck. Mills winced
involuntarily as the cat came whistling down on his bare back, and
the breath flew out of his body with a loud "Ugh!" A great red welt
sprang out against the white skin, with drops of blood trickling
down on one side. Mills was a burly ruffian and he endured the
first dozen without crying out, though by that time his back was a
red slough from neck to waist.</p>

<p>Bligh watched the punishment with folded arms. "I'll show the
man who's captain of this ship," I heard him remark placidly to
Christian. "By God, I will!" The eighteenth blow broke the iron of
Mills's self-control. He was writhing on the grating, his teeth
tightly clenched and the blood pouring down his back. "Oh!" he
shouted thickly. "Oh, my God! Oh!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Morrison," called Bligh, sternly and suddenly. "See that
you lay on with a will."</p>

<p>Morrison passed the tails of the cat through his fingers to free
them of blood and bits of flesh. Under the eye of the captain he
delivered the remaining lashes, taking a time that seemed
interminable to me. When they cut Mills down he was black in the
face and collapsed at once on the deck. Old Bacchus stumped forward
and ordered him taken below to the sick bay, to be washed with
brine. Bligh sauntered to the ladder-way and the men resumed their
duties sullenly.</p>

<p>Early in March we were ordered to lay aside our light tropical
clothing for warm garments which had been provided for our passage
around Cape Horn. The topgallant masts were sent down, new sails
bent, and the ship made ready for the heavy winds and seas which
lay ahead. The weather grew cooler each day, until I was glad to go
below for my occasional evenings with Bacchus and his cronies, or
to my mess in the berth. The surgeon messed with us now, as well as
Stewart and Hayward, my fellow midshipmen, Morrison, and Mr.
Nelson, the botanist. We were all the best of friends, though young
Hayward never forgot that I was his junior in service, and plumed
himself on a knowledge of seamanship certainly more extensive than
my own.</p>

<p>Those were days and nights of misery for every man on board.
Sometimes the wind hauled to the southwest, with squalls of snow,
forcing us to come about on the larboard tack; sometimes the gale
increased to the force of a hurricane and we lay hove-to under a
rag of staysail, pitching into the breaking seas. Though our ship
was new and sound, her seams opened under the strain and it became
necessary to man the pumps every hour. The hatches were constantly
battened down, and when the forward deck began to leak, Bligh gave
orders that the people should sling their hammocks in the great
cabin aft. At last our captain's iron determination gave way, and
to the great joy and relief of every man on board he ordered the
helm put up to bear away for the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>The fine weather which followed and our rapid passage east did
much to raise the spirits of the men on board. We had caught great
numbers of sea birds off Cape Horn and penned them in cages
provided by the carpenter. The pintado and the albatross were the
best; when penned like a Strasburg goose and well stuffed with
ground corn for a few days, they seemed to us as good as ducks or
geese, and this fresh food did wonders for our invalids.</p>

<p>With the returning cheerfulness on board, the <i>Bounty's</i>
midshipmen began to play the pranks of their kind the world over,
and none of us escaped penance at the masthead&mdash;penance that
was in general richly deserved. No one was oftener in hot water
than young Tinkler, a monkey of a lad, beloved by every man on the
ship. Bligh's severity to Tinkler, one cold moonlight night, when
we were in the longitude of Tristan da Cunha, was a warning to all
of us, and the cause of much murmuring among the men.</p>

<p>Hallet, Hayward, Tinkler, and I were in the larboard berth. The
gunner's watch was on duty, and Stewart and Young on deck. We had
supped and were passing the time at Ablewhackets&mdash;a game I
have never seen played ashore. It is commenced by playing cards,
which must be named the Good Books. The table is termed the Board
of Green Cloth, the hand the Flipper; the light the Glim, and so
on. To call a table a table, or a card a card, brings an instant
cry of "Watch," whereupon the delinquent must extend his Flipper to
be severely firked with a stocking full of sand by each of the
players in turn, who repeat his offense while firking him. Should
the pain bring an oath to his lips, as is more than likely, there
is another cry of "Watch," and he undergoes a second round of
firking by all hands. As will be perceived, the game is a noisy
one.</p>

<p>Young Tinkler had inadvertently pronounced the word "table," and
Hayward, something of a bully, roared, "Watch!" When he took his
turn at the firking, he laid on so hard that the youngster, beside
himself with pain, squeaked, "Ouch! Damn your blood!"</p>

<p>"Watch!" roared Hayward again, and at the same moment we heard
another roar from aft&mdash;Mr. Bligh calling angrily for the
ship's corporal. Tinkler and Hallet rushed for their berth on the
starboard side; Hayward doused the glim in an instant, kicked off
his pumps, threw off his jacket, and sprang into his hammock, where
he pulled his blanket up to his chin and began to snore, gently and
regularly. I wasted no time in doing the same, but young Tinkler,
in his anxiety, must have turned in all standing as he was.</p>

<p>Next moment, Churchill, the master-at-arms, came fumbling into
the darkened berth. "Come, come, young gentlemen; no shamming,
now!" he called. He listened warily to our breathing, and felt us
to make sure that our jackets and pumps were off, before he went
out, grumbling, to the starboard berth. Hallet had taken the same
precautions as ourselves, but poor little Tinkler was caught
red-handed&mdash;pumps, jacket, and all. "Up with you, Mr.
Tinkler," rumbled Churchill. "This'll mean the masthead, and it's a
bloody cold night. I'd let you off if I could. You young gentlemen
keep half the ship awake with your cursed pranks!" He led him aft,
and presently I heard Bligh's harsh voice, raised angrily.</p>

<p>"Damme, Mr. Tinkler! Do you think this ship's a beer garden? By
God! I've half a mind to seize you up and give you a taste of the
colt! To the masthead with you!"</p>

<p>Next morning at daylight Tinkler was still at the main
topgallant crosstrees. The sky was clear, but the strong
west-southwest wind was icy cold. Presently Mr. Bligh came on deck,
and, hailing the masthead, desired Tinkler to come down. There was
no reply, even when he hailed a second time. At a word from Mr.
Christian, one of the top-men sprang into the rigging, reached the
crosstrees, and hailed the deck to say that Tinkler seemed to be
dying, and that he dared not leave him for fear he would fall.
Christian himself then went aloft, sent the topman down into the
top for a tailblock, made a whip with the studding-sail halliards,
and lowered Tinkler to the deck. The poor lad was blue with cold,
unable to stand up or to speak.</p>

<p>We got him into his hammock in the berth, wrapped in warm
blankets, and Old Bacchus came stumping forward with a can of his
universal remedy. He felt the lad's pulse, propped his head up, and
began to feed him neat rum with a spoon. Tinkler coughed and opened
his eyes, while a faint colour appeared in his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Aha!" exclaimed the surgeon. "Nothing like rum, my lad! Just a
sip, now. That's it! Now a swallow. Begad! Nothing like rum. I'll
soon have you right as a trivet! And that reminds me&mdash;I'll
have just a drop myself. A corpse reviver, eh?"</p>

<p>Coughing as the fiery liquor ran down his throat, Tinkler smiled
in spite of himself. Two hours later he was on deck, none the worse
for his night aloft.</p>

<p>On the twenty-third of May we dropped anchor in False Bay, near
Cape Town. Table Bay is reckoned unsafe riding at this time of
year, on account of the strong northwest winds. The ship required
to be caulked in every part, for she had become so leaky that we
had been obliged to pump every hour during our passage from Cape
Horn. Our sails and rigging were in sad need of repair, and the
timekeeper was taken ashore to ascertain its rate. On the
twenty-ninth of June we sailed out of the bay, saluting the Dutch
fort with thirteen guns as we passed.</p>

<p>I have few recollections of the long, cold, and dismal passage
from the Cape of Good Hope to Van Diemen's Land. Day after day we
scudded before strong westerly to southwesterly winds, carrying
only the foresail and close-reefed maintopsail. The seas, which run
for thousands of miles in these latitudes, unobstructed by land,
were like mountain ridges; twice, when the wind increased to a
gale, Bligh almost drove his ship under before we could get the
sails dewed up and the <i>Bounty</i> hove-to. I observed that as
long as the wind held southwest or west-southwest great numbers of
birds accompanied us,&mdash;pintados, albatross, and blue
petrels,&mdash;but that when the wind chopped around to the north,
even for an hour or two, the birds left us at once. And when they
reappeared their presence was always the forerunner of a southerly
wind.</p>

<p>On the twentieth of August we sighted the rock called the
Mewstone, which lies near the southwest cape of Van Diemen's Land,
bearing northeast about six leagues, and two days later we anchored
in Adventure Bay. We passed a fortnight here&mdash;wooding,
watering, and sawing out plank, of which the carpenter was in need.
It was a gloomy place, hemmed in by forests of tall straight trees
of the eucalyptus kind, many of them a hundred and fifty feet high
and rising sixty or eighty feet without a branch. Long strips of
bark hung in tatters from their trunks, or decayed on the ground
underfoot; few birds sang in the bush; and I saw only one
animal&mdash;a small creature of the opossum sort, which scuttled
into a hollow log. There were men here, but they were timid as wild
animals&mdash;black, naked, and uncouth, with hair growing in tufts
like peppercorns, and voices like the cackling of geese. I saw
small parties of them at different times, but they made off at
sight of us.</p>

<p>Mr. Bligh put me in charge of a watering party, giving us the
large cutter and instructing me to have the casks filled in a gully
at the west end of the beach. Purcell, the carpenter, had rigged
his saw pit close to this place, and was busy sawing out plank,
with his mates, Norman and McIntosh, and two of the seamen detailed
to the task. They had felled two or three of the large eucalyptus
trees, but the carpenter, after inspecting the wood, had declared
it worthless, and instructed his men to set to work on certain
smaller trees of a different kind, with a rough bark and firm
reddish wood.</p>

<p>I was superintending the filling of my casks one morning when
Bligh appeared, a fowling piece over his arm and accompanied by Mr.
Nelson. He glanced toward the saw pit and came to a halt.</p>

<p>"Mr. Purcell!" he called harshly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The <i>Bounty's</i> carpenter was not unlike her captain in
certain respects. Saving the surgeon, he was the oldest man on
board, and nearly all of his life had been spent at sea. He knew
his trade as well as Bligh understood navigation, and his temper
was as arbitrary and his anger as fierce and sudden as Bligh's.</p>

<p>"Damme, Mr. Purcell!" exclaimed the captain. "Those logs are too
small for plank. I thought I instructed you to make use of the
large trees."</p>

<p>"You did, sir," replied Purcell, whose own temper was
rising.</p>

<p>"Obey your orders, then, instead of wasting time."</p>

<p>"I am not wasting time, sir," said the carpenter, very red in
the face.</p>

<p>"The wood of the large trees is useless, as I discovered when I
had cut some of them down."</p>

<p>"Useless? Nonsense...Mr. Nelson, am I not right?"</p>

<p>"I am a botanist, sir," said Nelson, unwilling to take part in
the dispute. "I make no pretense to a carpenter's knowledge of
woods."</p>

<p>"Aye&mdash;that's what a carpenter <i>does</i> know," put in old
Purcell. "The wood of these large trees will be worthless if sawn
into plank."</p>

<p>Bligh's temper now got the better of him. "Do as I tell you, Mr.
Purcell," he ordered violently. "I've no mind to argue with you or
any other man under my command."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," said Purcell obstinately. "The large trees it
is. But I tell you the plank will be useless. A carpenter knows his
business as well as a captain knows <i>his</i>."</p>

<p>Bligh had turned away; now he spun about on his heel.</p>

<p>"You mutinous old bastard&mdash;you have gone too far! Mr.
Norman, take command of the work here. Mr. Purcell, report yourself
instantly to Lieutenant Christian for fifteen days in irons."</p>

<p>It was my task to ferry Purcell out to the ship. The old man was
flushed with anger; his jaw was set and his fists clenched till the
veins stood out on his forearms. "Calls me a bastard," he muttered
to no one in particular, "and puts me in irons for doing my duty.
He hasn't heard the last of this, by God! Wait till we get to
England! I know my rights, I do!"</p>

<p>We were still on the shortest of short rations, and Adventure
Bay offered little in the way of refreshment for our invalids, or
food for those of us who were well. Though we drew the seine
repeatedly, we caught few fish and those of inferior kinds, and the
mussels among the rocks, which at first promised a welcome change
in our diet, proved poisonous to those who partook of them. While
Mr. Bligh feasted on the wild duck his fowling piece brought down,
the ship's people were half starved and there was much muttering
among the officers.</p>

<p>The whole of our fortnight in Adventure Bay was marred by
wrangling and discontent. The carpenter was in irons; Fryer and
Bligh were scarcely on speaking terms, owing to the master's
suspicions that the captain had lined his pockets in victualing the
ship; and just before our departure, Ned Young, one of the
midshipmen, was lashed to a gun on the quarter-deck and given a
dozen with a colt.</p>

<p>Young had been sent, with three men and the small cutter, to
gather shellfish, crabs, and whatever he might find for our sick,
who lived in a tent pitched on the beach. They pulled away in the
direction of Cape Frederick Henry and did not return till after
dark, when Young reported that Dick Skinner, one of the A.B.'s and
the ship's hairdresser, had wandered off into the woods and
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Skinner saw a hollow tree," Young told Mr. Bligh, "which, from
the bees about it, he believed to contain a store of honey. He
asked my permission to smoke the bees out and obtain their honey
for our sick, saying that he had kept bees in his youth and
understood their ways. I assented readily, knowing that you, sir,
would be pleased if we could obtain the honey, and an hour or two
later, when we had loaded the cutter with shellfish, we returned to
the tree. A fire still smouldered at its foot, but Skinner was
nowhere to be seen. We wandered through the woods and hailed till
nightfall, but I regret to report, sir, that we could find no trace
of the man."</p>

<p>I chanced to know that Bligh had called for the hairdresser,
requiring his services that very afternoon, and had been incensed
at Young when it was learned that Skinner had accompanied him. Now
that the man was reported missing, Mr. Bligh was thoroughly
enraged.</p>

<p>"Now damn you and all other midshipmen!" roared the captain.
"You're all alike! If you had gotten the honey, you would have
eaten it on the spot! Where the devil is Skinner, I say? Take your
boat's crew this instant and pull back to where you saw the man
last. Aye, and bring him back this time!"</p>

<p>Young was a man grown. He flushed at the captain's words, but
touched his hat respectfully and summoned his men at once. The
party did not return till the following forenoon, having been
nearly twenty-four hours without food. Skinner was with them this
time; he had wandered off in search of another honey tree and
become lost in the thick bush.</p>

<p>Bligh paced the quarter-deck angrily as the boat approached. By
nature a man who brooded over grudges till they were magnified out
of all proportion to reality, the captain was ready to explode the
moment Young set foot on deck.</p>

<p>"Come aft, Mr. Young!" he called harshly. "I'm going to teach
you to attend to your duty, instead of skylarking about the woods.
Mr. Morrison!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>"Come aft here and seize up Mr. Young on that gun yonder! You're
to give him a dozen with a rope's end."</p>

<p>Young was an officer of the ship and rated as a gentleman, a
proud, fearless man of gentle birth. Though Bligh was within his
powers as captain, the public flogging of such a man was almost
without precedent in the Service. Morrison's jaw dropped at the
order, which he obeyed with such evidence of reluctance that Bligh
shouted at him threateningly, "Look alive, Mr. Morrison! I've my
eye on you!"</p>

<p>I shall not speak of the flogging of Young, nor tell how
Skinner's back was cut to ribbons with two dozen at the gangway. It
is enough to say that Young was a different man from that day on,
performing his duties sullenly and in silence, and avoiding the
other midshipmen in the berth. He informed me long afterwards that,
had events turned out differently, it was his intention to resign
from the Service on the ship's arrival in England, and call Bligh
to account as man to man.</p>

<p>On the fourth of September, with a fine spanking breeze at
northwest, we weighed anchor and sailed out of Adventure Bay. Seven
weeks later, after an uneventful passage made miserable by an
outbreak of scurvy and the constant state of starvation to which we
were reduced, I saw my first South Sea island.</p>

<p>We had gotten our easting in the high southern latitudes, and
once in the trade winds we made a long board to the north on the
starboard tack. We were well into the tropics now and in the
vicinity of land. Man-of-war hawks hovered overhead, their long
forked tails opening and shutting like scissor-blades; shoals of
flying fish rose under the ship's cutwater to skim away and plunge
into the sea like whiffs of grapeshot. The sea was of the pale
turquoise blue only to be seen within the tropics, shading to
purple here and there where clouds obscured the sun. The roll of
the Pacific from east to west was broken by the labyrinth of low
coral islands to the east of us,&mdash;the vast cluster of
half-drowned lands called by the natives <i>Paumotu</i>,&mdash;and
the <i>Bounty</i> sailed a tranquil sea.</p>

<p>I was off watch that afternoon and engaged in sorting over the
articles I had laid in, at the suggestion of Sir Joseph Banks, for
barter with the Indians of Tahiti. Nails, files, and fishhooks were
in great demand, as well as bits of cheap jewelry for the women and
girls. My mother had given me fifty pounds for the purchase of
these things, and Sir Joseph had added another fifty to it,
advising me that liberality to the Indians would be amply repaid.
"Never forget," he had remarked, "that in the South Sea the Seven
Deadly Sins are compounded into one, and that one is meanness." I
had taken this advice to heart, and now, as I looked over my store
of gifts, I felt satisfied that I had laid out my hundred pounds to
good effect. I had been a lover of fishing since childhood, and my
hooks were of all sizes and the best that money could buy. My sea
chest was half filled with other things&mdash;coils of brass wire,
cheap rings, bracelets, and necklaces; files, scissors, razors, a
variety of looking-glasses, and a dozen engraved portraits of King
George, which Sir Joseph had procured for me. And down in one
corner of the chest, safe from the prying eyes of my messmates, was
a velvet-lined box from Maiden Lane. It contained a bracelet and
necklace, curiously wrought in a design like the sinnet seamen
plait. I was a romantic lad, not without my dreams of some fair
barbarian girl who might bestow her favours on me. As I look back
over the long procession of years, I cannot but smile at a boy's
simplicity, but I would give all my hard-earned worldly wisdom to
recapture if only for an hour the mood of those days of my youth. I
had returned them to my chest when I heard Mr. Bligh's harsh,
vibrant voice. His cabin was scarcely fifteen feet aft of where I
sat.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fryer!" he called peremptorily. "Be good enough to step
into my cabin."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the master's voice.</p>

<p>I had no desire to eavesdrop on the conversation that followed,
but there was no way to avoid it without leaving my open chest in
the berth.</p>

<p>"To-morrow or the day after," said Bligh, "we shall drop anchor
in Matavai Bay. I have had Mr. Samuel make an inventory of the
stores on hand, which has enabled him to cast up an account of the
provisions expended on the voyage so far. I desire you to glance
over this book, which requires your signature."</p>

<p>A long silence followed, broken at last by Fryer's voice. "I
cannot sign this, sir," he said.</p>

<p>"Cannot sign it? What do you mean, sir?"</p>

<p>"The clerk is mistaken, Mr. Bligh. No such amounts of beef and
pork have been issued!"</p>

<p>"You are wrong!" answered the captain angrily. "I know what was
taken aboard and what remains. Mr. Samuel is right!"</p>

<p>"I cannot sign, sir," said Fryer obstinately.</p>

<p>"And why the devil not? All that the clerk has done was done by
my orders. Sign it instantly! Damme! I am not the most patient man
in the world."</p>

<p>"I cannot sign," insisted Fryer, a note of anger in his voice;
"not in conscience, sir!"</p>

<p>"But you <i>can</i> sign," shouted Bligh in a rage; "and what is
more, you <i>shall!</i>" He went stamping up the ladderway and on
to the deck. "Mr. Christian!" I heard him shout to the officer of
the watch. "Call all hands on deck this instant!"</p>

<p>The order was piped and shouted forward and, when we assembled,
the captain, flushed with anger, uncovered and read the Articles of
War. Mr. Samuel then came forward with his book and a pen and
ink.</p>

<p>"Now, sir!" Bligh ordered the master, "sign this book!"</p>

<p>There was a dead silence while Fryer took up the pen
reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bligh," he said, controlling his temper with difficulty,
"the ship's people will bear witness that I sign in obedience to
your orders, but please to recollect, sir, that this matter may be
reopened later on."</p>

<p>At that moment a long-drawn shout came from the man in the
foretop. "Land ho!"</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c5" id="c5"></a>CHAPTER V.&mdash;TAHITI</h2>

<p>The lookout had sighted Mehetia, a small, high island forty
miles to the southeast of Tahiti. I stared ahead, half
incredulously, at the tiny motionless projection on the horizon
line. The wind died away toward sunset and we were all night
working up to the land.</p>

<p>I went off watch at eight bells, but could not sleep; an hour
later, perched on the fore-topgallant crosstrees, I watched the new
day dawn. The beauty of that sunrise seemed ample compensation for
all of the hardships suffered during the voyage: a sunrise such as
only the seaman knows, and then only in the regions between the
tropics, remote from home. Saving the light, fluffy "fair-weather
clouds" just above the vast ring of horizon which encircled us, the
sky was clear. The stars paled gradually; as the rosy light grew
stronger, the velvet of the heavens faded and turned blue. Then the
sun, still below the horizon, began to tint the little clouds in
the east with every shade of mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p>An hour later we were skirting the reef, before a light air from
the south. For the first time in my life I saw the slender,
graceful trunk and green fronds of the far-famed coconut tree, the
thatched cottages of the South Sea Islanders, set in their shady
groves, and the people themselves, numbers of whom walked along the
reef not more than a cable's length away. They waved large pieces
of white cloth and shouted what I supposed were invitations to come
ashore, though their voices were drowned in the noise of a surf
which would have made landing impossible even had Mr. Bligh hove-to
and lowered a boat.</p>

<p>Mehetia is high and round in shape, and not more than three
miles in its greatest extent. The village is at the southern end,
where there is a tolerably flat shelf of land at the base of the
mountain, but elsewhere the green cliffs are steep-to, with the sea
breaking at their feet. The white line of the breakers, the vivid
emerald of the tropical vegetation covering the mountains
everywhere, the rich foliage of the breadfruit trees in the little
valleys, and the plumed tops of the coconut palms growing in
clusters here and there, made up a picture which enchanted me. The
island had the air of a little paradise, newly created, all fresh
and dewy in the dawn, stocked with everything needful for the
comfort and happiness of man.</p>

<p>The men walking along the shelf of reef at the base of the
cliffs were too far away for inspection, but they seemed fine stout
fellows, taller than Englishmen. They were dressed in girdles of
bark cloth which shone with a dazzling whiteness in the morning
sunlight. They were naked except for these girdles, and they
laughed and shouted to one another as they followed us along,
clambering with great agility over the rocks.</p>

<p>As we rounded the northern end of the island, Smith hailed me
from the top. "Look, Mr. Byam!" he shouted, pointing ahead eagerly.
There, many leagues away, I saw the outlines of a mighty mountain
rising from the sea,&mdash;sweeping ridges falling away
symmetrically from a tall central peak,&mdash;all pale blue and
ghostly in the morning light.</p>

<p>The breeze was making up now, and the <i>Bounty</i>, heeling a
little on the larboard tack, was leaving a broad white wake. When I
reached the deck I found Mr. Bligh in a rarely pleasant mood. I
bade him good morning, standing to leeward of him on the
quarter-deck, and he saluted me with a clap on the back.</p>

<p>"There it is, young man," he said, pointing to the high ghostly
outlines of the land ahead. "Tahiti! We have made a long passage of
it, a long hard passage, but, by God, there is the island at
last!"</p>

<p>"It looks a beautiful island, sir," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Indeed it is&mdash;none more so. Captain Cook loved it only
next to England; were I an old man, with my work done and no family
at home, I should ask nothing better than to end my days under its
palms! And you will find the people as friendly and hospitable as
the land they inhabit. Aye&mdash;and some of the Indian girls as
beautiful. We have come a long way to visit them! Last night I was
computing the distance we have run by log since leaving England.
To-morrow morning, when we drop anchor in Matavai Bay, we shall
have sailed more than twenty-seven thousand miles!"</p>

<p>Since that morning, so many years ago, I have sailed all the
seas of the world and visited most of the islands in them,
including the West Indies, and the Asiatic Archipelago. But of all
the islands I have seen, none approaches Tahiti in loveliness.</p>

<p>As we drew nearer to the land, with the rising sun behind us,
there was not a man on board the <i>Bounty</i> who did not gaze
ahead with emotions that differed in each case, no doubt, but in
which awe and wonder played a part. But I am wrong&mdash;there was
one. Toward six bells, when we were only a few miles off the
southern extremity of the island, Old Bacchus came stumping on
deck. Standing by the mizzenmast, with a hand on a swivel-stock, he
stared indifferently for a moment at the wooded precipices, the
waterfalls and sharp green peaks, now abeam of the ship. Then he
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"They're all the same," he remarked indifferently. "When you've
seen one island in the tropics, you've seen the lot."</p>

<p>The surgeon went stumping to the ladderway, and, as he
disappeared, Mr. Nelson ceased his pacing of the deck to stand at
my side. The botanist was a believer in exercise and kept his
muscles hard and his colour fresh by walking two or three miles on
deck each morning the weather permitted.</p>

<p>"Well, Byam," he remarked, "I'm glad to be back! Many a time,
since my voyage with Captain Cook, I've dreamed of revisiting
Tahiti, without the faintest hope that the dream might come true.
Yet here we are! I can scarcely wait to set foot on shore!"</p>

<p>We were skirting the windward coast of Taiarapu, the richest and
loveliest part of the island, and I could not take my eyes off the
land. In the foreground, a mile or more offshore, a reef of coral
broke the roll of the sea, and the calm waters of the lagoon inside
formed a highway on which the Indians travel back and forth in
their canoes. Behind the inner beach was the narrow belt of flat
land where the rustic dwellings of the people were scattered
picturesquely among their neat plantations of the <i>ava</i> and
the cloth plant, shaded by groves of breadfruit and coconut. In the
background were the mountains&mdash;rising fantastically in
turrets, spires, and precipices, wooded to their very tops.
Innumerable waterfalls plunged over the cliffs and hung like
suspended threads of silver, many of them a thousand feet or more
in height and visible at a great distance against the background of
dark green. Seen for the first time by European eyes, this coast is
like nothing else on our workaday planet; a landscape, rather, of
some fantastic dream.</p>

<p>Nelson was pointing ahead to a break in the line of reef.
"Captain Cook nearly lost his ship yonder," he said, "when the
current set him on the reef during a calm. One of his anchors lies
there to this day&mdash;there where the sea breaks high. I know
this part of the island well. As you can see, Tahiti is made up of
two lands, connected by the low isthmus the Indians call Taravao.
This before us is the lesser, called Taiarapu or Tahiti Iti; the
great island yonder they call Tahiti Nui. Vehiatua is the king of
the smaller one&mdash;the most powerful of the Indian princes. His
realm is richer and more populous than those of his rivals."</p>

<p>All through the afternoon we skirted the land, passing the low
isthmus between the two islands, coasting the rich verdant
districts of Faaone and Hitiaa, and toward evening, as the light
breeze died away, moving slowly along the rock-bound coast of
Tiarei, where the reef ends and the sea thunders at the base of
cliffs.</p>

<p>There was little sleeping aboard the <i>Bounty</i> that night.
The ship lay becalmed about a league off the mouth of the great
valley of Papenoo, and the faint land breeze, wandering down from
the heights of the interior, and out to sea, brought with it the
sweet smell of the land and of growing things. We sniffed it
eagerly, our noses grown keen from the long months at sea,
detecting the scent of strange flowers, of wood smoke, and of
Mother Earth herself&mdash;sweetest of all smells to a sailor. The
sufferers from scurvy, breathing deep of the land breeze, seemed to
draw in new life; their apathy and silence left them as they spoke
eagerly of the fruits they hoped to eat on the morrow, fruits they
craved as a man dying of thirst craves water.</p>

<p>We sighted Eimeo a little before sunset: the small lofty island
which lies to the west of Tahiti, four leagues distant. The sun
went down over the spires and pinnacles of Eimeo's sky line, and
was followed into the sea by the thin golden crescent of the new
moon. There is little twilight in these latitudes and, almost
immediately it seemed to me, the stars came out in a cloudless dome
of sky. One great planet, low in the west, sent a shimmering track
of light over the sea. I saw the Cross and the Magellanic Clouds in
the south, and constellations unknown to dwellers in the Northern
Hemisphere, all close and warm and golden against the black sky. A
faint burst of song came from the surgeon's cabin below, where he
was carousing with Peckover; every other man on the ship, I
believe, was on deck.</p>

<p>All along shore we could see the flare of innumerable torches,
where the Indians went about their fishing or traveled from house
to house along the beach. The men of the <i>Bounty</i> stood by the
bulwarks or on the booms, speaking in low voices and gazing toward
the dark loom of the land. A change seemed to come over all of us
that night: all unhappiness, all discontent, seemed banished,
giving way to a tranquil content and the happiest anticipation of
what the morrow would bring. Mr. Bligh himself, walking the deck
with Christian, was rarely affable; as they passed me from time to
time I overheard snatches of his talk: "Not a bad voyage,
eh?...Only four down with scurvy, and we'll have them right in a
week ashore...The ship's sound as a walnut...Bad anchorage...We'll
soon shift out of Matavai Bay...A fine place for
refreshments..."</p>

<p>I was in the master's watch, and toward midnight Mr. Fryer
chanced to notice me stifling a yawn, for it was many hours since I
had slept.</p>

<p>"Take a caulk, Mr. Byam," he said kindly. "Take a caulk! All's
quiet to-night. I'll see that you are waked if we need you."</p>

<p>I chose a place in the shadow of the bitts, just abaft of the
main hatch, and lay down on deck, but, though I yawned with heavy
eyes, it was long before sleep came to me. When I awoke, the grey
light of dawn was in the East.</p>

<p>We had drifted some distance to the west during the night, and
now the ship lay off the valley of Vaipoopoo, from which runs the
river that empties into the sea at the tip of Point Venus, the most
northerly point of Tahiti Nui. It was here that the <i>Dolphin</i>,
Captain Wallis, had approached the newly discovered land, and here
on this long, low point Captain Cook had set up his observatory to
study the transit of the planet which gave the place its name. Far
off in the interior of the island, its base framed in the vertical
cliffs bordering the valley, rose the tall central mountain called
Orohena, a thin sharp pinnacle of volcanic rock which rises to a
height of seven thousand feet and is perhaps as difficult of ascent
as any peak in the world. Its summit was now touched by the sun,
and as the light of day grew stronger, driving the shadows from the
valley and illuminating the foothills and the rich smiling coastal
land, I fancied that I had never gazed on a scene more pleasing to
the eye. The whole aspect of the coast about Matavai Bay was open,
sunny, and hospitable.</p>

<p>The entrance to the bay bore southwest by west, little more than
a league distant, and a great number of canoes were now putting out
to us. Most of them were small, holding only four or five persons;
strange-looking craft, with an outrigger on the larboard side and a
high stern sweeping up in a shape almost semicircular. There were
two or three double canoes among them, each holding thirty or more
people. The Indian craft approached us rapidly. Their paddlers took
half a dozen short quick strokes on one side, and then, at a signal
from the man astern, all shifted to the other side. As the leading
canoes drew near, I heard questioning shouts: "<i>Taio</i>?
<i>Peritane?</i> <i>Rima?</i>" which is to say: "Friend? British?
Lima?" In the latter case, they were asking whether the
<i>Bounty</i> was a Spanish ship from Peru. "<i>Taio</i>!" shouted
Bligh, who knew some words of the Tahitian language. "<i>Taio</i>!
<i>Peritane!</i>" Next moment the first boatload of Indians came
springing over the bulwarks, and I had my first glimpse at close
quarters of this far-famed race.</p>

<p>Most of our visitors were men&mdash;tall, handsome, stalwart
fellows, of a light copper colour. They wore kilts of figured cloth
of their own manufacture, light fringed capes thrown over their
shoulders and joined at the throat, and turbans of brown cloth on
their heads. Some of them, naked from the waist up, displayed the
arms and torsos of veritable giants; others, instead of turbans,
wore on their heads the little bonnets of freshly plaited coconut
leaves they call <i>taumata</i>. Their countenances, like those of
children, mirrored every passing mood, and when they smiled, which
was often, I was astonished at the whiteness and perfection of
their teeth. The few women who came on board at this time were all
of the lower orders of society, and uncommonly diminutive as
compared with the men. They wore skirts of white cloth falling in
graceful folds, and cloaks of the same material to protect their
shoulders from the sun, draped to leave the right arm free, and not
unlike the toga of the Romans. Their faces were expressive of good
nature, kindness, and mirth, and it was easy to perceive why so
many of our seamen in former times had formed attachments among
girls who seemed to have all the amiable qualities of their
sex.</p>

<p>Mr. Bligh had given orders that the Indians were to be treated
with the greatest kindness by everyone on board, though watched
closely to prevent the thefts to which the commoners among them
were prone. As the morning breeze freshened and we worked in toward
the entrance with yards braced up on the larboard tack, the hubbub
on the ship was deafening. At least a hundred men and a quarter as
many women overran the decks, shouting, laughing, gesticulating,
and addressing our people in the most animated manner, as if taking
for granted that their unintelligible harangues were understood.
The seamen found the feminine portion of our visitors so engaging
that we had difficulty in keeping them at their stations. The
breeze continued to freshen, and before long we sailed through the
narrow passage between the westerly point of the reef before Point
Venus and the sunken rock called the Dolphin Bank, on which Captain
Wallis so nearly lost his ship. At nine in the forenoon we dropped
anchor in Matavai Bay, in thirteen fathoms.</p>

<p>A vast throng of visitors set out immediately from the beach in
their canoes, but for some time no persons of consequence came on
board. I was joking with a party of girls to whom I had given some
trifling gifts, when Mr. Bligh's servant came on deck to tell me
that the captain desired to see me below. I found him alone in his
cabin, bending over a chart of Matavai Bay.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Byam," he said, motioning me to sit down on his chest.
"I want a word with you. We shall probably lie here for several
months while Mr. Nelson collects our young breadfruit plants. I am
going to release you from further duties on board so that you may
be free to carry out the wishes of my worthy friend, Sir Joseph
Banks. I have given the matter some thought and believe that you
will best accomplish your task by living ashore amongst the
natives. Everything now depends on your choice of a <i>taio</i>, or
friend, and let me advise you to go slowly. Persons of consequence
in Tahiti, as elsewhere, do not wear their hearts on their sleeves,
and should you make the mistake of choosing a friend among the
lower orders of their society, you will find yourself greatly
handicapped in your work."</p>

<p>He paused and I said, "I think I understand, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes," he went on. "By all means go slowly. Spend as much time
as you wish on shore for a day or two, and when you have found a
family to your liking inform me of the fact, so that I may make
inquiries as to their standing. Once you have settled on a
<i>taio</i> you can move your chest and writing materials ashore.
After that I expect to see no more of you except when you report
your progress to me once each week."</p>

<p>He gave me a curt but friendly nod, and perceiving that the
interview was at an end, I rose and took leave of him. On deck, Mr.
Fryer, the master, beckoned me to him.</p>

<p>"You have seen Mr. Bligh?" he asked, raising his voice to make
the words audible in the din. "He informed me last night that on
our arrival here you were to be relieved of duty on board the ship.
There is nothing to fear from the Indians. Go ashore at any time
you wish. You are free to make gifts of your own things to the
Indians, but remember&mdash;no trading. The captain has placed all
of the trading in the hands of Mr. Peckover. You are to make a
dictionary of the Indian tongue, I understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;at the desire of Sir Joseph Banks."</p>

<p>"A praiseworthy task&mdash;a praiseworthy task! Some slight
knowledge of the language will no doubt be of great service to
future mariners in this sea. And you're a lucky lad, Mr. Byam, a
lucky lad! I envy you, on my word I do!"</p>

<p>At that moment a double canoe, which had brought out a handsome
gift of pigs from some chief ashore, cast off from the ship. I was
all eagerness to set foot on land. "May I go with those people if
they'll have me?" I asked the master.</p>

<p>"Off with you, by all means. Give them a hail."</p>

<p>I sprang to the bulwarks and shouted to catch the attention of a
man in the stern of one of the canoes, who seemed to be in a
position of authority. As I caught his eye, I pointed to myself,
then to the canoe, and then to the beach a cable's length away. He
caught my meaning instantly and shouted some order to his paddlers.
They backed water so that the high stern of one of the canoes came
close alongside, rising well above the <i>Bounty's</i> bulwarks. As
I sprang over the rail and slid down the hollowed-out stern into
the canoe, the paddlers, glancing back over their shoulders and
grinning at me, raised a cheer. The Indian captain gave a shout, a
score of paddles dug into the water simultaneously, and the canoe
moved away toward the land.</p>

<p>From One Tree Hill to Point Venus a curving beach of black
volcanic sand stretches for about a mile and a half. We were
heading for a spot about midway between these two boundaries of
Matavai Bay, and I saw that a considerable surf was pounding on the
steep beach. As we drew near the breakers the man in the stern of
the other canoe snatched up a heavy steering paddle and shouted an
order which caused the men to cease paddling while four or five
waves passed under us. A dense throng of Indians stood on the
beach, awaiting our arrival with eagerness. Suddenly the man beside
me began to shout, gripping the haft of his steering paddle
strongly.</p>

<p>"<i>A hoe</i>!" he shouted. "<i>Teie to are rahi</i>!" (Paddle!
Here is the great wave!) I recollect the words, for I was destined
to hear them many times.</p>

<p>The men bent to their work, all shouting together; the canoe
shot forward as a wave larger than the others lifted us high in the
air and sent us racing for the sands. While the steersman held us
stern-on, with efforts that made the muscles of his arms bulge
mightily, we sped far up the beach, where a score of willing hands
seized our little vessel to hold her against the backwash of the
sea. I sprang out as the wave receded and made my way to high-water
mark, while rollers were fetched and the double canoe hauled ashore
with much shouting and laughter, to be housed under a long thatched
shed.</p>

<p>Next moment I was surrounded by a throng so dense that I could
scarcely breathe. But the crowd was good-natured and civil as no
crowd in England could be; all seemed desirous to welcome me with
every sign of pleasure. The clamour was deafening, for all talked
and shouted at once. Small children with bright dark eyes clung to
their mothers' skirts and stared at me apprehensively, while their
mothers and fathers pushed forward to shake my hand, a form of
greeting, as I was to learn with some surprise, immemorially old
among the Tahitians.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly as the clamour of voices had begun, it ceased.
The people fell back deferentially to make way for a tall man of
middle age, who was approaching me with an air of easy authority
and good-natured assurance. A murmur ran through the crowd: "<i>0
Hitihiti!</i>"</p>

<p>The newcomer was smooth-shaven, unlike most of the Indian men,
who wore short beards. His hair, thick and sprinkled with grey, was
close-cropped, and his kilt and short fringed cloak were of the
finest workmanship and spotlessly clean. He was well over six feet
in height, lighter-skinned than the run of his countrymen, and
magnificently proportioned; his face, frank, firm, and humorous,
attracted me instantly.</p>

<p>This gentleman&mdash;for I recognized at a glance that he was of
a class different from any of the Indians I had seen
hitherto&mdash;approached me with dignity, shook my hand warmly,
and then, seizing me by the shoulders, applied his nose to my
cheek, giving several loud sniffs as he did so. I was startled by
the suddenness and novelty of the greeting, but I realized that
this must be what Captain Cook and other navigators had termed
"nose-rubbing," though in reality it is a smelling of cheeks, and
corresponds to our kiss. On releasing me, my new friend stepped
back a pace while a loud murmur of approval, went through the
crowd. He then pointed to his broad chest and said: "Me Hitihiti!
You midshipman! What name?"</p>

<p>I was so taken aback at these words of English that I stared at
him for a moment before I replied. The people had evidently been
waiting to see what effect the marvelous accomplishment of their
compatriot would produce, and my display of astonishment turned out
to be precisely what they were hoping for. There were nods and
exclamations of satisfaction on all sides, and Hitihiti, now
thoroughly pleased with himself and with me, repeated his question,
"What name?"</p>

<p>"Byam," I replied; and he said, "Byam! Byam!" nodding violently,
while "Byam, Byam, Byam," echoed throughout the crowd. Hitihiti
again pointed to his chest. "Fourteen year now," he said with an
air of pride, "me sail Captain Cook!" "<i>Tut&eacute;!
Tut&eacute;!</i>" exclaimed a little old man close by, as if afraid
that I might not understand. "Could I have a drink of water?" I
asked, for it was long since I had tasted any but the foul water
aboard ship. Hitihiti started, and seized my hand.</p>

<p>He shouted an order to the people about us, which sent some of
the boys and young men scampering off inland. He then led me up the
steep rise behind the beach to a rustic shed where several young
women made haste to spread a mat. We sat down side by side, and the
crowd, increasing rapidly as parties of Indians arrived from up and
down the coast, seated themselves on the grass outside. A dripping
gourd, filled to the brim with clear sparkling water from the brook
near by, was handed me, and I drank deep, setting it down, half
empty with a sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p>I was then given a young coconut to drink&mdash;my first taste
of this cool, sweet wine of the South Sea&mdash;and a broad leaf
was spread beside me, on which the young woman laid ripe bananas
and one or two kinds of fruit I had not seen before. While I set to
greedily on these delicacies, I heard a shout go up from the crowd,
and saw that the <i>Bounty's</i> launch was coming in through the
surf, with Bligh in the stern sheets. My host sprang to his feet.
"<i>0 Parai!</i>" he exclaimed, and, as we waited for the boat to
land, "You, me, <i>taio</i>, eh?"</p>

<p>Hitihiti was the first of the Indians to greet Bligh, whom he
seemed to know well. And the captain recognized my friend at
once.</p>

<p>"Hitihiti," he said as he shook the Indian's hand, "you've grown
little older, my friend, though you've some grey hairs now."</p>

<p>Hitihiti laughed. "Ten year, eh? Plenty long time! By God!
Parai, you get fat!"</p>

<p>It was now the captain's turn to laugh, as he touched his waist,
by no means small in girth.</p>

<p>"Come ashore," the Indian went on emphatically. "Eat plenty pig!
Where Captain Cook? He come Tahiti soon?"</p>

<p>"My father?"</p>

<p>Hitihiti looked at Bligh in astonishment. "Captain Cook your
father?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;didn't you know that?"</p>

<p>For a moment the Indian chief stood in silent amazement; then,
with extraordinary animation, he raised a hand for silence and
addressed the crowd. The words were unintelligible to me, but I
perceived at once that Hitihiti was a trained orator, and I knew
that he was telling them that Bligh was the son of Captain Cook.
Mr. Bligh stood close beside me as the chief went on with his
harangue.</p>

<p>"I have instructed all of the people not to let the Indians know
that Captain Cook is dead," he said in a low voice. "And I believe
that we shall accomplish our mission the quicker for their belief
that I am his son."</p>

<p>While I was somewhat taken aback by this piece of deception, I
knew the reverence in which the people of Tahiti held the name of
Cook, and perceived that, according to the Jesuitical idea that the
end justifies the means, Mr. Bligh was right.</p>

<p>As Hitihiti ceased to speak there was a buzz of excited talk
among the Indians, who looked at Bligh with fresh interest, not
unmixed with awe. In their eyes, Captain Cook's son was little less
than a god. I took the opportunity to inform Mr. Bligh that
Hitihiti had offered to become my <i>taio</i>, and that with his
approval I thought well of the idea, since I should be able to
communicate to some extent with my Indian friend.</p>

<p>"Excellent," said the captain with a nod. "He is a chief of
consequence on this part of the island, and nearly related to all
of the principal families. And, as you say, the English he picked
up on board the <i>Resolution</i> should be of great assistance to
you in your work." He turned to the Indian. "Hitihiti!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Parai."</p>

<p>"Mr. Byam informs me that you and he are to be friends."
Hitihiti nodded. "Me, Byam, <i>taio</i>!"</p>

<p>"Good!" said Bligh. "Mr. Byam is the son of a chief in his own
land. He will have gifts for you, and in return I want you to take
him to your house, where he will stop. His work, while we are here,
is to learn your language, so that British seamen may be able to
converse with your people. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>Hitihiti turned to face me and stretched out an enormous hand.
"<i>Taio</i>, eh?" he remarked smilingly, and we shook hands on the
bargain.</p>

<p>Presently a canoe was launched to fetch my things from the ship,
and that night I slept in the house of my new
friend&mdash;Hitihiti-Te-Atua-Iri-Hau, chief of Mahina and Ahonu,
and hereditary high priest of the temple of Fareroi.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c6" id="c6"></a>CHAPTER VI.&mdash;AN INDIAN
HOUSEHOLD</h2>

<p>I can still recall vividly our walk that afternoon&mdash;from
the landing place to Point Venus, and eastward, behind a second
long curving beach of sand, on which the sea broke high, to the
house of my <i>taio</i>, set on a grassy point, sheltered from the
sea by a short stretch of coral reef which supported a beautiful
little islet called Motu Au. The islet was not more than half a
cable's length from shore; its beaches were of snowy coral sand,
contrasting with the rich dark green of the tall trees that grew
almost to the water's edge. Between the beach and the islet lay the
lagoon&mdash;warm blue water, two or three fathoms deep and clear
as air.</p>

<p>We walked in constant shade, under groves of breadfruit trees on
which the fruit was beginning to ripen. Many of these trees must
have been of immense age, from their girth and height; with their
broad glossy leaves, smooth bark, and majestic shape, they are
among the noblest of all shade trees, and certainly the most useful
to mankind. Here and there the slender bole of an old coconut palm
rose high in the air; scattered picturesquely, as if at random,
among the groves I saw the houses of the Indians, thatched with
bright yellow leaves of the palmetto and surrounded by fences of
bamboo.</p>

<p>My host, though no more than forty-five, was already many times
a grandfather, and as we approached his house, after a walk of
little more than half an hour, I heard joyful shouts and saw a
dozen sturdy children skipping out to greet him. They halted at
sight of me, but soon lost their fear and began to climb up
Hitihiti's legs and examine, inquisitively as monkeys, the strange
garments I wore. By the time we came to the door the chief had a
small boy on each of his shoulders, and his eldest granddaughter
was leading me by the hand.</p>

<p>The house was a fine one&mdash;sixty feet long by twenty wide,
with a lofty, newly thatched roof, and, instead of gables,
semicircular extensions at each end, giving the whole an oval
shape. Such houses were built only for chiefs. The ends, supported
by pillars of old polished coconut wood, were open, and the sides
were walled by vertical lathes of bright yellow bamboo, through
which the air filtered freely. The floor was of fresh white coral
sand, spread with mats at one end on a thick bed of sweet-smelling
grass called <i>aretu</i>. Of furniture there was scarcely any:
small wooden pillows on the family bed, like tiny tables with four
short legs; two or three of the seats used only by chiefs, carved
from a single log of hard red wood; and a stand of weapons hanging
on one of the pillars which supported the ridgepole, including my
host's ponderous war club.</p>

<p>Hitihiti's daughter&mdash;mother of two of the younger children
accompanying us&mdash;met us at the door. She was a young woman of
twenty-five, with a stately figure and carriage, and the pale
golden skin and auburn hair which are not uncommon among this
people. These fair Indians were termed <i>ehu</i>; I have seen men
and women of this strain&mdash;unmixed with European
blood&mdash;whose eyes were blue. My host smiled at his daughter
and then at me.</p>

<p>"0 Hina," he said in introduction. He said something to her in
which I distinguished the word <i>taio</i> and my own name. Hina
stepped forward with a grave slow smile to shake my hand, and then,
taking me by the shoulders as her father had done, she laid her
nose to my cheek and sniffed. I reciprocated this Indian kiss, and
smelled for the first time the perfume of the scented coconut oil
with which the women of Tahiti anoint themselves.</p>

<p>There are perhaps no women in the world&mdash;not even the
greatest ladies of fashion in Europe&mdash;more meticulous in the
care of their persons than were the Indian women of the upper
class. Each morning and evening they bathed in one of the
innumerable clear cool streams, not merely plunging in and out
again, but stopping to be scrubbed from head to foot by their
serving women with a porous volcanic stone, used as we use pumice
in our baths. Their servants then anointed them with
<i>monoi</i>&mdash;coconut oil, perfumed with the petals of the
Tahitian gardenia. Their hair was dried and arranged, a task which
required an hour or more; their eyebrows were examined in a mirror
which consisted of a blackened coconut shell filled with water, and
plucked or shaven with a shark's tooth, to make the slender arch
which was the fashion among them. A servant then brought a supply
of powdered charcoal with which the teeth were scrubbed. When they
were ready to dress, the skirt, or <i>pareu</i>, which reached from
waist to the knees and was of snow-white bark cloth, was adjusted
so that each fold hung in a certain fashion. Then came the cloak,
which was worn to protect the upper part of the body from sunburn,
which the ladies of Tahiti dreaded quite as much as the ladies of
the English Court. Each fold of the cloak was arranged just so, and
it was ridiculous&mdash;to a man, at least&mdash;to watch the long
efforts of a tirewoman to please her mistress in this respect.</p>

<p>Hina's manners were as handsome as her person. She had the
smiling dignity and perfect assurance only to be found among the
highest circles of our own race, a poised urbanity, neither forward
nor shy. And this is, perhaps, a fitting place to say a word for
the Indian ladies, so often and so shamelessly slandered by the
different navigators who have visited their island. Captain Cook
alone, who knew them best and was their loyal friend, has done them
justice, saying that virtue was perhaps as common and as highly
prized among them as among our own women at home, and that to form
an impression of the ladies of Tahiti from the women who visited
his ships would be like judging the virtue of Englishwomen from a
study of the nymphs of Spithead. In Tahiti, as in other lands,
there are people given over to vice and lewdness, and women of this
kind naturally congregated upon the arrival of a ship; but, so far
as I know, there was also as great a proportion of faithful wives
and affectionate mothers as elsewhere, many of whom were a
veritable honour to their sex.</p>

<p>The house which was to be my dwelling for many months stood, as
I have said, on a grassy point, about a mile to the eastward of
Point Venus. Either by accident or by design, the site was one that
commanded in all directions prospects an artist might have traveled
many miles to paint. On the northern side were the beach, the
lagoon, and the beautiful little island already mentioned; to the
south, or directly inland, was the great valley of Vaipoopoo and a
distant glimpse of Orohena, framed in the cliffs of the gorge; to
the west lay Point Venus, with the sea breaking high on the
protecting reefs; and to the east, facing the sunrise, was a
magnificent view of the rocky, unprotected coast of Orofara and
Faaripoo, where the surges of the Pacific thundered and spouted at
the base of stern black cliffs. No doubt because of the beauty of
the easterly view at dawn, the name of our point was
Hitimahana&mdash;the rising of the sun.</p>

<p>A little crowd of the chief's retainers gathered about us,
regarding their patron's friend with respectful curiosity, and,
while Hina gave some order to the cooks, an exceedingly handsome
young girl came out of the house and, at a word from my
<i>taio</i>, greeted me as his daughter had done. Her name was
Maimiti, and she was a niece of my host's&mdash;a proud, shy girl
of seventeen.</p>

<p>With a nod to Hina my <i>taio</i> led me to his rustic dining
room&mdash;a thatched shed in the shade of a clump of ironwood
trees, about a hundred yards distant. The floor of coral sand was
spread with mats, on which a dozen of the broad fresh leaves of the
plantain served as our tablecloth. The men of Tahiti were
uncommonly fond of the company of their women, whose position in
society was perhaps as high as that of women anywhere. They were
petted, courted, permitted no share in any hard labour, and allowed
a liberty such as only our own great ladies enjoy. Yet in spite of
all this, the Indians believe that Man was sky-descended, and Woman
earth-born: Man <i>raa</i>, or holy; Woman <i>noa</i>, or common.
Women were not permitted to set foot in the temples of the greater
gods, and among all classes of society it was
forbidden&mdash;unthinkable in fact&mdash;for the two sexes to sit
down to a meal together. I was surprised to find that Hitihiti and
I sat down alone to our dinner, and that no woman had a hand either
in the cooking or in the serving of the meal.</p>

<p>We sat facing each other across the cloth of fresh green leaves.
A pleasant breeze blew freely through the unwalled house, and the
breakers on the distant reef made a murmuring undertone of sound. A
serving man brought two coconut shells of water, in which we washed
our hands and rinsed our mouths. I felt a sharp hunger, augmented
by savoury whiffs of roasting pork from the cookhouse not far
off.</p>

<p>We were given baked fish with cooked plantains and bananas; pork
fresh from the oven, and certain native vegetables which I had
never tasted before; and a great pudding to finish with, served
with a sauce of rich, sweet coconut cream. I was only a lad, with
the appetite of a midshipman, and I had been many months at sea,
but though I did my best to maintain the honour of England by
eating enough for three men, my host put me to shame. Long after
repletion forced me to halt, Hitihiti continued his leisurely meal,
devouring quantities of fish, pork, plantains, and pudding I can
only describe as fabulous. At last he sighed and called for water
to wash his hands.</p>

<p>"First eat&mdash;now sleep," he said, as he rose. A wide mat was
spread for us under an old branching purau tree on the beach. We
lay down side by side for the siesta which in Tahiti always follows
the midday meal.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of a period of my life on which I look
back with nothing but pleasure. I had not a care in the world, save
the making of my dictionary, in which I took the keenest interest,
and which gave me sufficient occupation to prevent ennui. I lived
on the fat of the land, amongst affectionate friends and amid
surroundings of the most exquisite beauty. We rose at dawn, plunged
into the river which ran within pistol shot of Hitihiti's door, ate
a light breakfast of fruits, and went about our occupations until
the fishing canoes returned from the sea at eleven or twelve
o'clock. Then, while the meal was preparing, I had a bath in the
sea, swimming across to the islet or sporting in the high breakers
further west. After dinner the whole household slept till three or
four in the afternoon, when I frequently joined them in excursions
to visit their friends. After sundown, when the strings of
candlenuts were lit, we lay about on mats, conversing or telling
stories till one after another dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p>During the voyage out from England I had gone through Dr.
Johnson's dictionary, which had been provided for me, marking such
words as seemed to me in most common usage in everyday speech. I
had then set these down alphabetically&mdash;nearly seven thousand
in all. My present task was to discover and set down their
equivalents in the Indian tongue. I have always loved languages;
the study of them has been one of the chief interests of my life,
and in my younger days I could pick up a new tongue more readily,
perhaps, than most men. If I am blessed with any talent, it is the
humble one of the gift of tongues.</p>

<p>The language of Tahiti appealed to me from the first, and with
the help of my <i>taio</i>, his daughter, and young Maimiti, I made
rapid progress and was soon able to ask simple questions and to
understand the replies. It is a strange language and a beautiful
one. Like the Greek of Homer, it is rich in words descriptive of
the moods of Nature and of human emotions; and, like Greek again,
it has in certain respects a precision that our English lacks. To
break a bottle is <i>parari</i>; to break a rope, <i>motu</i> to
break a bone, <i>fati</i>. The Indians distinguish with the
greatest nicety between the different kinds of fear: fear of a
scolding or of being shamed is <i>matau</i>; fear of a dangerous
shark or of an assassin, <i>riaria</i>; fear of a spectre must be
expressed with still another word. They have innumerable adjectives
to express the varying moods of sea and sky. One word describes the
boundless sea without land in sight; another the deep blue sea off
soundings; another the sea in a calm with a high oily swell. They
have a word for the glance which passes between a man and a woman
planning an assignation, and another word for the look exchanged by
two men plotting to assassinate a third. Their language of the
eyes, in fact, is so eloquent and so complete that at times they
seem scarcely to need a spoken tongue. They are masters of the
downcast eye, the sidelong glance, the direct glance, the raising
of the eyebrow, the lift of the chin, and all the pantomime with
which they can communicate without those about them being aware of
the fact.</p>

<p>I think I may say, in all truth, that I was the first white man
to speak fluently the Tahitian tongue, and the first to make a
serious attempt to reduce the language to writing. Sir Joseph Banks
had provided me with a brief vocabulary, compiled from his own
notes and from Captain Cook's, but as soon as I heard the Indian
tongue spoken I realized that, as he had suggested, a new system of
orthography must be devised. Since my work was to be done for the
benefit of mariners, it seemed better to aim at simplicity than at
a high degree of academic perfection, so I devised an alphabet of
thirteen letters&mdash;five vowels and eight consonants&mdash;with
which the sounds of the language could be set down fairly well.</p>

<p>Hitihiti spoke the Tahitian language as only a chief could, for
the lower orders, as in other lands, possessed vocabularies of no
more than a few hundred words. He was interested in my work and of
infinite use to me, though, as with all his countrymen, mental
effort fatigued him if sustained for more than an hour or two. I
overcame this difficulty by making myself agreeable to the ladies,
and dividing my work into two parts. From Hitihiti I learned the
words pertaining to war, religion, navigation, shipbuilding,
fishing, agriculture, and other manly pursuits; from Hina and
Maimiti I obtained vocabularies concerning the pursuits and
amusements of women.</p>

<p>I opened my chest on the day of my arrival at their house and
made my host a present of what I thought would please him and the
ladies most. This was the seal on our pledged friendship, but
though my files, fishhooks, scissors, and trinkets were received
with appreciation, I had the satisfaction of learning, as time went
on, that the friendship of an Indian like Hitihiti was not for
sale. He and his daughter and his niece were sincerely fond of me,
I believe, showing their affection in many unmistakable ways. I
must have been an infinite nuisance to them, with my pen and ink
and endless questions, but their patient good-humour was equal to
my demands. Sometimes Maimiti would throw up her hands in mock
despair, and exclaim laughingly: "Let me be! I can think no more!"
or the old chief, after an hour's patient answering of my
questions, would say: "Let us sleep, Byam! Take care, or you will
crack your head and mine with too much thinking!" But on the next
morning they were always ready to help me once more.</p>

<p>Each Sunday I gathered my manuscript together and reported
myself on board the <i>Bounty</i> to Mr. Bligh. I must say, in
justice to him, that whatever task he undertook was thoroughly
performed. He showed the greatest interest in my work, and never
failed to run over with me the list of words I had set down during
the week. Had his character in other respects been equal to his
courage, his energy, and his understanding, Bligh would to-day have
his niche in history, among the great seamen of England.</p>

<p>Shortly after the arrival of the <i>Bounty</i>, Mr. Bligh had
ordered a large tent pitched near the landing place, and Nelson and
his assistant, a young gardener named Brown, were now established
on shore, with seven men to help them gather and pot the breadfruit
plants.</p>

<p>This tree cannot be propagated from seeds, since it produces
none. Mr. Nelson informed me that in his opinion the breadfruit had
been cultivated and improved from time immemorial, until&mdash;as
in the case of the banana&mdash;seeds had been entirely eliminated
from the fruit. It seems to thrive best when tended by man, and in
the neighbourhood of his dwellings. When well grown, the breadfruit
tree sends out lateral roots of great length, within a foot or two
of the surface of the ground. Should an Indian desire a young tree
to plant elsewhere, he has only to dig down and cut one of these
roots, which, when separated from the parent tree, immediately
sends up a vigorous young plant. When the shoot has reached the
height of a man, it is ready to be transplanted, which is done by
first cutting it back to a height of about a yard, and then digging
down to cut off a small section of the root. Planted in suitable
soil and watered from time to time, not one in a hundred of the
young trees will fail to grow.</p>

<p>Nelson took long walks daily, scouring the districts of Mahina
and Pare for young plants already well grown. The chiefs had
ordered their subjects to give Nelson all he asked for, as a
present to be sent to King George in return for the gifts the
<i>Bounty</i> had brought from England.</p>

<p>The <i>Bounty's</i> people who remained on board seemed to have
forgotten for the time being their captain's severities and the
hardships of our long voyage. Discipline was relaxed; the men were
allowed to go frequently on shore; and except for the surgeon every
man of them had his Indian <i>taio</i>, and nearly every one his
Indian lass. Tahiti was in those days a veritable paradise to the
seaman&mdash;one of the richest islands in the world, with a mild
and wholesome climate, abounding in every variety of delicious
food, and inhabited by a race of gentle and hospitable barbarians.
The humblest A. B. in the forecastle might enter any house on
shore, assured of a welcome. And as regards the possibilities of
dissipation, to which seamen are given in every port, the island
could only be described as a Mohammedan paradise.</p>

<p>When I had been about a fortnight at my <i>taio</i>'s house I
was agreeably surprised one morning to receive a visit from some of
my shipmates, who came around from Matavai Bay in a double canoe.
She was paddled by a dozen or more Indians, and three white men sat
in the stern. My host had gone aboard the <i>Bounty</i> that day to
dine with Bligh, and I stood on the beach as the canoe approached,
with Hina, Maimiti, and Hina's husband, a young chief named Tuatau.
As the canoe rose on a wave I saw that the two white men facing me
were Christian and Peckover, and a moment later I was amazed to see
Old Bacchus on the thwart aft of them. A wave reared up behind the
little vessel, the Indians dashed their paddles into the water, and
the canoe swept forward and ran far up the beach.</p>

<p>The surgeon sprang over the gunwale and came stumping up to
greet me, his wooden leg sinking deep into the sand. I had on only
a girdle of the native cloth, and my shoulders were burned brown by
the sun.</p>

<p>"Well, Byam," said Bacchus as he shook my hand, "damme if I
didn't think you an Indian at first! Time I was going ashore, I
thought, and where should I go if not to pay you a visit, my lad!
So I bottled off a dozen of Teneriffe wine." He turned to the
gunner, who stood by the canoe. "Hey, Peckover," he called
solicitously, "tell them to be easy with that hamper&mdash;should
any of the bottles be broken, it would mean another trip to the
ship."</p>

<p>Christian gave me a handshake, with a glint of amusement in his
eyes, and we waited while the surgeon and Peckover superintended
the unloading of a large hamper of wine. Presently a native came
staggering up the beach with it, and I introduced my shipmates to
my Indian friends. Hina and her husband led the way to the house,
and we followed, Maimiti walking with Christian and me. I had liked
Christian from the moment when I first set eyes on him, but it was
not until we reached Tahiti that I came to know him well. He was a
stalwart, handsome man, and more than once, during the short walk
to the house, I saw young Maimiti give him a sidelong glance.</p>

<p>When we were seated on mats on Hitihiti's cool verandah, Old
Bacchus motioned the men to set down the hamper of wine. Still
panting from the exertion of his walk, he fumbled for his snuffbox,
pulled up his sleeve, laid a train of snuff on his polished
forearm, and sniffed it up in a twinkling. Then, after a violent
sneeze or two and a flourish of his enormous handkerchief, he
reached into his coat tails and produced a corkscrew.</p>

<p>He and Peckover were soon well under way on a morning's carouse,
and Tuatau loth to leave them while the wine held out, so
Christian, Maimiti, Hina, and I walked away up the beach, leaving
the preparations of our dinner to Hitihiti's numerous cooks. The
morning was warm and calm, and we were glad to walk in the shade of
the tall ironwood trees that fringed the sands. A river little
larger than an English brook flowed into the sea about a mile east
of the house, ending in a clear deep pool close to the beach.
Gnarled old hibiscus trees arched together overhead, and the sun,
filtering through their foliage, cast changing patterns of light
and shade on the still water. The two girls retreated into the
underbrush and soon stepped out clad in light girdles of glazed
native cloth, which is nearly waterproof. No women in the world are
more modest than the ladies of Tahiti, but they bare their breasts
as innocently as an Englishwoman shows her face. Standing beside me
on the bank, clad in a native kilt which showed his own stalwart
figure to the best advantage, Christian glanced up at them and
caught his breath.</p>

<p>"My God, Byam!" he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>Slenderly and strongly made, in the first bloom of young
womanhood, and with her magnificent dark hair unbound, Maimiti made
a picture worth traveling far to behold. She stood for a moment
with a hand on the elder woman's shoulder, and then, gathering her
kilt about her, she ran nimbly up a gnarled limb that overhung the
deep water. Poising herself for an instant high above the pool, she
sprang into the water with a merry shout, and I saw her swimming
with slow easy strokes along the bottom, two fathoms deep.
Christian, a capital swimmer, went in head first, and Hina followed
him with a great splash. For an hour or more we frolicked in the
pool, startling shoals of small speckled fish like trout, and
making the cool green tunnel overhead echo with laughter.</p>

<p>The Indians of Tahiti rarely bathe in the sea except when a
great surf is running. At such times the more daring among the men
and women delight in a sport they call horue&mdash;swimming out
among the great breakers with a light board about a fathom long,
and choosing their moment to come speeding in, a quarter of a mile
or more, on the crest of a high feathering sea. Their daily bathing
is done in the clear cool streams which flow down from the
mountains everywhere, and though they bathe twice, and often three
times each day, they look forward to the next bath as though it
were the first in a month. Men, women, and children bathe together
with a great hubbub of shouting and merriment, for this is the
social hour of their day, when friends are met, courtships carried
on, and gossip and news exchanged.</p>

<p><a name="id04" id="id04"></a>After our bath we dried ourselves
in the sun, while the girls combed out their hair with combs of
bamboo, curiously carved. Christian was a gentleman, and very far
from a rake, though of a warm and susceptible temperament. He
lagged behind with young Maimiti while we walked back to the house,
and once, turning my head by chance, I saw that the two were
walking hand in hand. They made a handsome couple&mdash;the young
English seaman and the Indian girl. The kindly fate which veils the
future from us gave me no inkling of what lay in store for these
two&mdash;destined to face together, hand in hand as I saw them
now, long wanderings and suffering, and tragedy. Maimiti cast down
her eyes, while a blush suffused her clear olive cheeks with
crimson, and strove gently to release her hand; but Christian held
her fast, smiling at me.</p>

<p>"Every sailor must have his sweetheart," he said, half lightly
and half in earnest, "and I've found mine. I'll stake my life
there's not a truer lass in all these islands!"</p>

<p>Hina smiled gravely and touched my arm as a hint to leave
Christian to his courting. She had liked him at first sight, and
knew his rank on board. And thanks to the uncanny fashion in which
news of every sort spreads among the people of Tahiti, she knew
that he had had no traffic with the women who infested the
ship.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c7" id="c7"></a>CHAPTER VII.&mdash;CHRISTIAN AND
BLIGH</h2>

<p>From the day of his meeting with Maimiti, Christian missed no
opportunity of visiting us, arriving by day or by night as his
duties on board the <i>Bounty</i> permitted. The Indians, who felt
no need of unbroken sleep, were frequently up and about during the
night, and often made a meal at midnight when the fishers returned
from the reef. Old Hitihiti oftentimes awakened me merely from a
desire to converse, or when he suddenly recollected some word which
had escaped his memory during the day. I grew accustomed to this
casual and broken sleep, and learned, like my host, to make up
during the afternoon for what was lost at night.</p>

<p>Christian was soon accepted by the household as the avowed lover
of Maimiti. He seldom came without some little gifts for her, and
the others, and his visits were anticipated with eager pleasure. He
was a man of moods; at sea I had seen him stern, reticent, and
almost intimidating for a fortnight at a time. Then all at once he
would unbend, shake off his preoccupation, and become the heartiest
and gayest of companions. No man knew better how to make himself
agreeable to others when he chose; his sincerity, his education,
which went beyond that of most sea officers of the time, and the
charm of his manner combined to win the respect of men and women
alike. And the ardour of his nature, his handsome person and
changing moods, made him what women call a romantic man.</p>

<p>One night, when I had been about six weeks at the house of
Hitihiti, I was awakened gently in the Indian fashion by a hand on
my shoulder. The flare of a candlenut made a dim light in the
house, and I saw Christian standing over me, with his sweetheart at
his side.</p>

<p>"Come down to the beach, Byam," he said; "they have built a fire
there. I have something to tell you."</p>

<p>Rubbing the sleep from my eyes, I followed them out of the
house, to where a fire of coconut husks burned bright and ruddy.
The night was moonless and the sea so calm that the breakers
scarcely whispered on the sand. Mats were spread around the fire,
and Hitihiti's people lay about, conversing in low voices while
fish roasted on the coals.</p>

<p>Christian sat down, his back to the bole of a coconut palm and
an arm about Maimiti's waist, while I reclined near by. I knew at
the first glance that his gaiety of the weeks past had been
succeeded by one of his sombre moods.</p>

<p>"I must tell you," he said slowly, at the end of a long silence,
"Old Bacchus died last night."</p>

<p>"Good God!" I exclaimed..."What..."</p>

<p>"He died, not of drink, as might have been supposed, but of
eating a poisonous fish. We purchased about fifty pounds of fish
from a canoe that came in from Tetiaroa, and your mess had a string
of them fried for dinner yesterday. They were of a bright red
colour and different from the others. Hayward, Nelson, and Morrison
were close to death for six hours, but they are better now. The
surgeon died at eight bells, four hours ago."</p>

<p>"Good God!" I repeated stupidly and mechanically.</p>

<p>"He will be buried in the morning, and Mr. Bligh bids you to be
on hand."</p>

<p>At first the news dazed me and I did not realize the full extent
of the loss; little by little the fact that Old Bacchus was no
longer of the <i>Bounty's</i> company came home to me.</p>

<p>"A drunkard," said Christian musingly, as if to himself, "but
beloved by all on board. We shall be the worse off for his death."
Maimiti turned to me, and in the ruddy firelight I saw glistening
in her eyes the easy tears of her race. "<i>Ua mate te ruau avae
hoe</i>," she said sorrowfully. (The old man with one leg is
dead.)</p>

<p>"I have been many years at sea," Christian went on, "and I can
tell you that the welfare of men on shipboard depends on things
which seem small. A joke at the right moment, a kind word, or a
glass of grog is sometimes more efficacious than the
cat-of-nine-tails. With the surgeon gone, life on the <i>Bounty</i>
will not be what it was."</p>

<p>Christian spoke no more that night, but sat gazing into the
fire, a sombre expression in his eyes. Maimiti, a silent girl, laid
her head on his shoulder and fell asleep, while he stroked her hair
tenderly and absently. I lay awake for a long time, thinking of Old
Bacchus and of the trick of fate which had so abruptly closed his
career, on a heathen island, twelve thousand miles from England.
Perhaps his jovial shade would be well content to haunt the moonlit
groves of Tahiti, where the sea he loved was only a pistol shot
away&mdash;its salt smell in the air and the thunder of its
breakers sounding day and night. And he had died on shipboard, as
he would have desired, safe from the dreaded years of retirement on
shore. Christian was right, I thought; without Old Bacchus, life on
the <i>Bounty</i> could not be the same.</p>

<p>We buried him on Point Venus, close to where Captain Cook had
set up his observatory twenty years before. There was some delay in
getting the consent of Teina, the great chief whom the English had
believed to be king of Tahiti, and who was the first of the
Pomares. At last all was arranged, and the Indians themselves dug
the grave, laying it out very exactly east and west. It was not
until four o'clock in the afternoon that Old Bacchus was laid to
rest, Bligh reading the burial service and a great crowd of
Indians&mdash;silent, attentive, and respectful&mdash;surrounding
us. When the captain and the <i>Bounty's</i> people had gone on
board to see to the auctioning of the dead man's effects, Nelson
and Peckover remained on shore, the former still pale and shaken
from fish poisoning. The Indians had dispersed, and only the three
of us lingered by the new grave, covered with slabs of coral in the
Indian style.</p>

<p>Nelson cleared his throat and drew from a bag he carried three
glasses and a bottle of Spanish wine. "We were his best friends on
board," he said to Peckover, "you and Byam and I. I think it would
please him if we added one small ceremony to the burial service
Captain Bligh read so well." The botanist cleared his throat once
more, handed us the glasses, and uncorked his bottle of wine. Then,
baring our heads, we drank in silence to Old Bacchus, and when the
bottle was empty we broke our glasses on the grave.</p>

<p>The relaxation of discipline which had followed the hardships of
the <i>Bounty's</i> long voyage now came to an end as Bligh's harsh
and ungovernable temper once more began to assert itself. I saw
something of what was going on during my visits to the ship, and
learned more from Hitihiti and Christian, who gave me to understand
that there was much murmuring on board.</p>

<p>Each man on the ship, as I have said, had his Indian friend, who
felt it his duty to send out to his <i>taio</i> frequent gifts of
food. The seamen quite naturally regarded this as their own
property, to be disposed of as they wished, but Bligh soon put an
end to such ideas by announcing that all that came on board
belonged to the ship, to be disposed of as the captain might
direct. It was hard for a seaman whose <i>taio</i> had sent out a
fine fat hog of two or three hundredweight to see it seized for
ship's stores, and to be forced to dine on a small ration of poor
pork issued by Mr. Samuel. Even the master's hogs were seized,
though Bligh had at the moment forty of his own.</p>

<p>I witnessed unpleasant scenes of this kind one morning when I
had gone on board to wait upon Mr. Bligh. The captain had gone
ashore and was not expected for some time, so I loitered by the
gangway, watching the canoes put out from shore. Young Hallet, the
petulant and sickly-looking midshipman whom I liked least of those
in the berth, was on duty to see that no provisions were smuggled
on board, and he stepped to the gangway as a small canoe, paddled
by two men, came alongside. Tom Ellison, the youngest of the seamen
and the most popular with all hands, was in the bow of the canoe.
He dropped his paddle, clambered up the ship's side, touched his
forelock to Hallet, and leaned down to take the gifts his
<i>taio</i> handed up to him. They were a handful of the Indian
apples called vi, a fan, with a handle made of a whale's tooth,
curiously carved, and a bundle of the native cloth. The Indian
grinned up at Ellison, waved his hand, and paddled away. Hallet
stooped to take up the apples laid on deck, and began to eat one,
saying, "I must have these, Ellison."</p>

<p>"Right, sir," said Ellison, though I could see that he regretted
his fruit. "You'll find them sweet!"</p>

<p>"And this fan," said the midshipman, taking it from Ellison's
hand. "Will you give it to me?"</p>

<p>"I cannot, sir. It comes from a girl. You've a <i>taio</i> of
your own."</p>

<p>"He pays me no attention these days, What have you there?"</p>

<p>"A bundle of tapa cloth."</p>

<p>Hallet stooped to feel the thick bundle and gave the seaman an
evil smile. "It feels uncommonly like a sucking pig. Shall I call
Mr. Samuel?" Ellison flushed and the other went on, without giving
him time to reply, "See here! A bargain&mdash;the fan's mine, and I
say nothing about the pig."</p>

<p>Without a word, the young seaman snatched up his bundle and
strode off to the forecastle in a rage, leaving the fan in his
superior's hands. I was about to utter angry words when Samuel, the
captain's clerk, walked aft. Hallet stopped him. "Do you want a bit
of tender pork?" he asked in a low voice. "Then go to the
forecastle. I suspect that Ellison has a sucking pig wrapped up in
a bale of the Indian cloth!" Samuel gave him a nod and a knowing
leer, and passed. I stepped forward.</p>

<p>"You little swine!" I said to Hallet.</p>

<p>"You've been spying on me, Byam!" he squeaked.</p>

<p>"And if you were not such a contemptible little sneak, I'd do
more than that!"</p>

<p>The captain's boat was approaching, and, swallowing my anger, I
began to prepare the manuscript of my week's work for his
inspection. Half an hour later, when the interview with Bligh was
over and we came on deck, I found Christian at the gangway, to
receive a gift of provisions and other things sent out by Maimiti,
a great landowner in her own right.</p>

<p>There were a brace of fat hogs, as well as taro, plantains, and
other vegetables; fine mats, Indian cloaks, and a pair of very
handsome pearls from the Low Islands. Bligh strolled to the
gangway, and, seeing the hogs, called for Samuel and ordered him to
take them over for ship's stores. Christian flushed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bligh," he said, "I meant these hogs for my own mess."</p>

<p>"No!" answered the captain harshly.</p>

<p>He glanced at the mats and cloaks, which Christian was about to
send below. "Mr. Samuel," he went on, "take charge of these Indian
curiosities, which may be useful for trading in other groups."</p>

<p>"One moment, sir," protested Christian. "These things were given
me for members of my family in England."</p>

<p>Instead of replying, the captain turned away contemptuously
toward the gangway. Maimiti's servant was handing up to Christian a
small package done up in the tapa cloth. "Pearls," said the man in
the Indian tongue. "My mistress sends them to you, to be given your
mother in England." Still deeply flushed with anger, Christian took
the package from the man's hand.</p>

<p>"Did he say pearls?" put in Bligh. "Come&mdash;let me see them!"
Samuel craned his neck and I admit that I did the same.
Reluctantly, and in angry silence, Christian unwrapped the small
package to display a matched pair of pearls as large as
gooseberries, and of the most perfect orient. Samuel, a London Jew,
permitted himself an exclamation of astonishment. After a moment's
hesitation, Bligh spoke.</p>

<p>"Give them to Mr. Samuel," he ordered. "Pearls are highly prized
in the Friendly Islands."</p>

<p>"Surely, sir," exclaimed Christian angrily, "you do not mean to
seize these as well! They were given me for my mother!"</p>

<p>"Deliver them to Mr. Samuel," Bligh repeated.</p>

<p>"I refuse!" replied Christian, controlling himself with a great
effort.</p>

<p>He turned away abruptly, closing his hand on the pearls, and
went below. A glance passed between the captain and his clerk, but
though Bligh's hands were clasping and unclasping behind his back,
he said no more.</p>

<p>It was not hard to imagine the feelings of the <i>Bounty's</i>
people at this time&mdash;rationed in the midst of plenty, and
treated like smugglers each time they returned from shore. There
must have been much angry murmuring in the forecastle, for the
contrast between life on shore and life on the ship was oversharp.
I had a home and my mother to return to, but the seamen could look
forward to nothing in England save the prospect of the press gang,
or begging on the Portsmouth streets. It seemed to me that if Mr.
Bligh continued as he had begun, we should soon have desertions or
worse.</p>

<p>Going on board to report myself one morning in mid-January, I
found the captain pacing the quarter-deck in a rage. I stood to
leeward of him for some time before he noticed me, and then,
catching his eye, I saluted him and said, "Come on board, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Byam," he said, coming to a halt abruptly. "I cannot
run over your work to-day; we'll put it off till next week. The
ship's corporal and two of the seamen&mdash;Muspratt and
Millward&mdash;have deserted. The ungrateful scoundrels shall
suffer for this when I get my hands on them! They took the small
cutter and eight stand of arms and ammunition. I have just learned
that they left the cutter not far from here and set out for
Tetiaroa in a sailing canoe." Mr. Bligh paused, his face set
sternly, and seemed to reflect. "Has your <i>taio</i> a large
canoe?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I replied.</p>

<p>"In that case I shall put the pursuit in your hands. Ask for
Hitihiti's canoe and as many of his men as you think necessary, and
sail for Tetiaroa to-day. The wind is fair. Secure the men without
using force if you can, but secure them! Churchill may give you
some trouble. Should you find that they are not on the island,
return to-morrow if the wind permits."</p>

<p>When I had taken leave of the captain, I found Stewart and
Tinkler in the berth.</p>

<p>"You've heard the news, of course," said Stewart.</p>

<p>"Yes; Mr. Bligh told me, and I've the task of catching the men."
Stewart laughed. "By God! I don't envy you!"</p>

<p>"How did they make off with the cutter?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Hayward was mate of the watch, and was fool enough to take a
caulk. The men stole away with the cutter while he slept. Bligh was
like a madman when he learned it. He's put Hayward in irons for a
month, and threatens to have him flogged on the day of his
release!"</p>

<p>An hour later I found Hitihiti at the house, and told him of my
orders and of the captain's request for the loan of his large
sailing canoe. He agreed at once to let me have her, with a dozen
of his men, and insisted on accompanying the expedition
himself.</p>

<p>My host's vessel was of the kind called <i>va'a motu</i>&mdash;a
single sailing canoe, about fifty feet long and two foot beam. On
the larboard side, at a distance of about a fathom from the hull,
was a long outrigger, or float, made fast to cross booms fore and
aft, which crossed the gunwales and were lashed fast to them. Her
mast was tall and strongly stayed, and her great sail of closely
woven matting was bordered with a light frame of saplings.</p>

<p>I watched idly while Hitihiti's retainers rolled the vessel out
from her shed where she was kept, carefully oiled and chocked high
above the ground. They fetched the mast and stepped it, and set up
the standing rigging all ataut. Then, in their leisurely fashion,
the women of the household fetched bunches of newly husked drinking
nuts and other provisions for the voyage. The men seemed to look
forward eagerly to the expedition&mdash;a break in the dreamy
monotony of their lives. Counting on taking the deserters by
surprise, they seemed to have no fear of the muskets, but Hitihiti
asked me with some concern if I were sure that Churchill and his
companions had no pistols. When I assured him that the deserters
were not provided with pistols, he brightened at once, and began to
speak of the voyage.</p>

<p>We sailed at two o'clock in the afternoon, with a fresh easterly
breeze on the beam. Tetiaroa lies almost due north of Matavai,
about thirty miles distant. It is a cluster of five low coral
islands, set here and there on the reef which encircles a lagoon
some four miles across, and is the property of what mariners call
the royal family&mdash;that of the great chief Teina, or Pomare. It
is the fashionable watering place for the chiefs of the north end
of Tahiti; they repair to its shady groves to recover from the
ravages of the <i>ava</i> with which they constantly intoxicate
themselves, and to live on a light wholesome diet of coconuts and
fish. And to Tetiaroa also repair the <i>pori</i>&mdash;the young
girls, one from each district of Tahiti, who are placed on stone
platforms at certain times of the year, where they may be admired
and compared with their competitors by passers-by. In Tetiaroa,
these <i>pori</i> are fed on a special diet, kept in the shade to
bleach their skins, and constantly rubbed with the perfumed
mollifying oil called <i>monoi</i>; and I must do the old women who
care for them the justice to remark that the whole of Europe might
be searched without finding a score of young females lovelier than
the pori I saw on one small coral island.</p>

<p>As we bore away for Tetiaroa I began to appreciate the qualities
of Hitihiti's canoe. Amidships, a long, heavy plank, adzed out of a
breadfruit tree, extended from the outrigger float, across the
gunwales, and well outboard on the weather side. Four or five of
the heaviest men of our crew now took their places on this plank,
well out to windward, to prevent us from capsizing in the gusts.
Two other men were employed constantly in bailing, as the canoe
tore through the waves at a speed of not less than twelve knots.
The <i>Bounty</i> sailed well, as ships went in those days, but
Hitihiti's little vessel would have sailed two miles to her one.
The chief and I sat side by side on a seat in her high stern, well
above the spray which flew over her bows as she sliced through the
waves.</p>

<p>At considerable hazard we ran our canoe over the reef and into
the calm waters of the Tetiaroa lagoon. There we were soon
surrounded by small canoes and swimmers, all eager to impart some
information of importance: the deserters, fearing pursuit, had set
sail two or three hours before, some thought for Eimeo, others for
the west side of Tahiti. The wind was dying away, as it does toward
sunset in this region, and since darkness would soon set in and we
had no certain knowledge of Churchill's destination, Hitihiti
deemed it best to spend the night on Tetiaroa, and return to Bligh
with our news when the morning breeze made up.</p>

<p>I shall not forget the night I spent on the coral island. The
Indians of Tahiti are by nature a people given over to levity,
passionately devoted to pleasure, and incapable of those burdens of
the white man&mdash;worry and care. And in Tetiaroa, their watering
place, they seemed to cast aside whatever light cares of family and
state they feel when at home, and pass the time in entertainments
of every kind, by night and by day. Relieved of his mission, which
I am convinced he would have done his utmost to accomplish under
other circumstances, Hitihiti now seemed to forget everything but
the prospects of entertainment ashore, directing his paddlers to
make at once for the nearest islet, called Rimatuu.</p>

<p>Three or four chiefs and their retinues were on the islet at the
time, and, as its area was no more than five hundred acres, the
place seemed densely populated. We were lodged at the house of a
famous warrior named Poino, whose recent excesses in drinking the
<i>ava</i> had nearly cost him his life. He lay on a pile of mats,
scarcely able to move, his skin scaling off and green as verdigris,
but Hitihiti informed me that in a month he would be quite
restored. Several of Poino's relatives had accompanied him to
Tetiaroa, and among them was a young girl, a member of the great
Vehiatua family of Taiarapu, in charge of two old Women. I had a
glimpse of her in the distance as we supped, but thought no more of
the young lady till after nightfall, when I was invited to see a
<i>heiva</i>, or Indian entertainment.</p>

<p>Strolling with Hitihiti through the groves, we saw the flare of
torchlight some distance ahead, and heard the beating of the small
drums&mdash;a hollow, resonant sound with a strange measure. My
friend's head went up and his step quickened. Ahead of us, in a
large clearing, there was a raised platform of hewn blocks of
coral, about which no less than two or three hundred spectators
were seated on the ground. The scene was brightly illuminated by
torches of coconut leaves, bound in long bundles and held aloft by
serving men, who lighted fresh ones as fast as the old burned out.
As we took our places, two clowns, called <i>faaata</i>, were
finishing a performance which raised a gale of laughter, and as
they stepped off the platform six young women, accompanied by four
drummers, trooped on to perform. These girls were of the lower
order of society, and their dance was believed by the Indians to
ensure the fertility of the crops. The dress of the dancers
consisted of no more than a wreath of flowers and green leaves
about their waists, and the dance itself, in which they stood in
two lines of three, face to face, was of a nature so unbelievably
wanton that no words could convey the least idea of it. But if the
clowns had raised a gale of laughter, the dance raised a hurricane.
Hitihiti laughed as heartily as the rest&mdash;the antics of one
girl, in fact, brought the tears to his eyes and caused him to slap
his thigh resoundingly. Presently the dance was over and, in the
pause that followed, my <i>taio</i> informed me that we were now to
see a dance of a very different kind.</p>

<p>The second group of dancers came through the crowd, which parted
right and left before them, each girl escorted by two old women and
announced by a herald, who shouted her name and titles as she
stepped on to the platform. All were dressed alike and very
beautifully, in flowing draperies of snow-white Indian cloth, and
the curious headdresses called <i>tamau</i>. They carried fans,
with handles curiously carved, and over their breasts they wore
plates of pearl shell, polished till they gleamed like mirrors, and
tinted with all the colors of the rainbow. Selected for their
beauty, nurtured with the greatest care, kept constantly in the
shade, and beautified with the numerous Indian cosmetics, these
girls were of the most exquisite loveliness. Poino's young
relative, the second to be announced, caused a murmur of admiration
among the spectators.</p>

<p>Like all the Indians of the upper class, she was a full head
taller than the commoners. Her figure was of the most perfect
symmetry, her skin smooth and blooming as an apricot, and her dark
lustrous eyes set wide apart in a face so lovely that I caught my
breath at sight of her. While the herald announced her long name,
and longer list of titles, she stood facing us, her eyes cast down
proudly and modestly. Judging that the announcement was
unintelligible to me, Hitihiti leaned over and whispered the girl's
household name.</p>

<p>"Tehani," he announced in my ear, which is to say "The Darling,"
a name by no means inappropriate, I thought. The <i>hura</i> is
danced in couples, and next moment Tehani and the first girl began
to dance. The measure is slow, stately, and of great beauty, the
movements of the arms, in particular, being wonderfully graceful
and performed in the most exact time. When Tehani and her companion
retired from the stage, amid hearty applause, they were succeeded
by a brace of clowns, whose antics kept us laughing till the next
pair of girls was ready to dance. But I scarcely noticed the other
performers, for I was eager to return to the house, whither I knew
Tehani had been led. It was fortunate for my work and my peace of
mind, I thought somewhat ruefully, that she was not a member of
Hitihiti's household, yet I knew that I would have given anything I
possessed to have had her there. But I was not destined to see her
again in Tetiaroa, for her two old duennas guarded her closely in a
small separate house.</p>

<p>We sailed about two hours after sunrise, with the east wind
abeam, and I was able to make my report to Mr. Bligh the same
afternoon. The deserters were not apprehended till nearly three
weeks later, when they gave themselves up, worn out by guarding
against the constant attempts of the Indians to capture them.
Churchill was given two dozen lashes, and Muspratt and Millward
four dozen each.</p>

<p>The <i>Bounty</i> had at this time been shifted to a new
anchorage in the harbour of Toaroa, where she was moored close to
the shore. It had been Bligh's intention to have Hayward flogged
with the deserters, and on the morning of the punishment, happening
to be on board, I saw Hayward's <i>taio</i>, a chief named Moana,
standing on deck with a sullen and gloomy face. But at the last
moment the captain changed his mind and ordered Hayward below, to
serve out the balance of his month in irons. On the same night an
incident occurred which might have caused the loss of the ship and
left us marooned among the Indians without the means of returning
to England. The wind blew fresh from northwest all night, directly
on shore, and at daybreak it was discovered that two strands of the
small bower cable had been cut through, and that only one strand
was holding the <i>Bounty</i> off the rocks. Mr. Bligh made a great
to-do about the affair, but it was not till sometime afterwards
that I learned the truth of it.</p>

<p>Hitihiti told me that Moana, Hayward's <i>taio</i>, was so
incensed at the prospect of seeing the midshipman flogged that he
had gone aboard that morning with a loaded pistol concealed under
his cloak, planning to shoot Mr. Bligh through the heart before the
first stroke of the cat could be delivered. Seeing his <i>taio</i>
escape a flogging, but sent below to be confined, Moana conceived
the idea of releasing his friend by wrecking the ship. He sent one
of his henchmen to sever the cable under cover of night, and had
the man performed his task properly the ship would infallibly have
been lost.</p>

<p>I reflected for some time on Hitihiti's words, and finally,
considering the incident closed and knowing that the cables were
now watched with extra care throughout the night, I came to the
conclusion that it was not necessary to inform Mr. Bligh of what I
had learned. To tell him would only have increased his harshness to
Hayward, and caused trouble with Moana, a powerful chief.</p>

<p>Toward the end of March it became evident to all hands that the
<i>Bounty</i> would soon set sail. More than a thousand young
breadfruit trees, in pots and tubs, had been taken on board, and
the great cabin aft resembled a botanical garden with the young
plants standing thick in their racks, all in a most flourishing
condition, their foliage of the richest dark green. Great
quantities of pork had been salted down, under the captain's
direction, and a large sea store of yams laid in. Only Mr. Bligh
knew when we would sail, but it was clear that the day of departure
could not be far off.</p>

<p>I confess that I felt no eagerness to leave Tahiti. No man could
have lived with so kind a host as Hitihiti without becoming deeply
attached to the old man and his family, and my work on the Indian
language interested me more each day. I was now able to carry on
ordinary conversations with some fluency, though I knew enough to
realize that a real mastery of this complex tongue would require
years. The vocabulary I had planned was now complete and had been
many times revised as I perceived mistakes, and I had made good
progress on the grammar. Leading a life of the most delightful ease
and tranquillity, and engaged on a congenial task in which I felt
that I was making some headway, it is not to be wondered at that
for days at a time I scarcely gave England a thought. Had it not
been for my mother, I believe that I might have been content to
settle down to a long period of the Indian life, and had I been
assured that another vessel would touch at Tahiti within six months
or a year, I should certainly have asked Mr. Bligh's permission to
stop over and complete my work. Christian, whom I had grown to know
well, disliked the thought of departure as much as I. His
attachment to Maimiti was of the tenderest description, and I knew
how he must dread the final parting from her. Of the midshipmen,
Stewart was as deeply attached to his Indian sweetheart as
Christian himself. Young was constantly in the company of a girl
called Taurua, the Indian name for the evening star. Stewart called
his sweetheart Peggy; she was the daughter of a chief of some
consequence on the north end of the island, and devotedly attached
to him. A day or two before the <i>Bounty</i> sailed, Christian,
Young, and Stewart strolled up the beach to call on me, accompanied
by Alexander Smith, my hammock man. Smith had formed an alliance
with a short, dark, lively girl of the lower orders, who loved him
in the robust fashion of a sailor's lass. He called her Bal'hadi,
which was as close as his honest English tongue could twist itself
to Paraha Iti, her true name.</p>

<p>We had been so long in Tahiti, and my shipmates had been so
constantly in the company of the natives, that many of them were
able to make themselves understood to some extent in the Indian
language, Both Stewart and Ellison spoke it remarkably well, and
Young and Smith had likewise made considerable progress in it.
Smith, nevertheless, was of the opinion that, if English were
spoken slowly and in a loud voice, it must be a stupid foreigner
indeed who could fail to understand.</p>

<p>As my visitors from the <i>Bounty</i> approached the house I
knew instinctively that Christian had news for me, but he had been
so much among the Indians that he had acquired some notion of their
ceremonial ideas of politeness, which demand a decent interval of
light conversation before any important announcement is made.</p>

<p>Maimiti greeted her lover affectionately, and old Hitihiti had
mats spread for us in the shade and ordered drinking coconuts to be
fetched. My host had asked me, as a last favour, to have made for
him a model of the <i>Bounty's</i> launch, which he admired
greatly. He believed that with the aid of this model his native
shipwrights would be able to build a boat, since I had explained to
him the process of warping a plank. I had entrusted the model
making to Smith, who had completed the task in less than a week,
with every dimension true to scale. He walked behind the others,
followed by Bal'hadi, who carried the model on her shoulder.
Hitihiti's face lit up at sight of it.</p>

<p>"Now I shall start my boat," he said to me in the native tongue.
"You have kept your word and I am well content!"</p>

<p>"Let him remember," said Smith, "a foot to the inch and he can't
go wrong, I'll warrant!"</p>

<p>He handed the model to Hitihiti, who took it with every sign of
pleasure and gave me an order to one of his servants, who soon
appeared leading a pair of fine hogs.</p>

<p>"They are for you, Smith," I explained, but my hammock man shook
his head regretfully.</p>

<p>"No use, sir," he said. "Mr. Bligh won't let us keep the pigs
our <i>taios</i> send on board. But if the old chief would give me
a sucking pig, me and my lass could cook and eat it in no time." He
smacked his lips and gave me a hopeful glance.</p>

<p>Hitihiti smiled with pleasure at the request and directed that
Smith should go with one of the Indians to pick out the pig that
pleased him best. A few minutes later the seaman passed us, his
sweetheart at his side and a squealing young porker under his arm.
They disappeared into a thicket near the beach, and presently we
heard louder squeals, followed by silence, and saw a column of
smoke rising above the trees. I have a fancy that the Indian law
which prohibited women from dining with men was broken that
day.</p>

<p>Reclining in the shade and drinking the sweet milk of young
coconuts, we had been gossiping idly with the girls, and presently
Christian glanced up and caught my eye.</p>

<p>"I have news for you, Byam," he said. "We are to set sail on
Saturday. Mr. Bligh bids you come on board on Friday night."</p>

<p>As if she understood the words, Maimiti looked at me
sorrowfully, took her lover's hand and held it tight. "Bad news for
me, at any rate," Christian went on. "I have been very happy
here."</p>

<p>"And for me," put in Stewart, with a glance at his Peggy.</p>

<p>Young yawned. "I'm not sentimental," he remarked. "Taurua here
will soon find another fancy man." The lively brown-eyed girl at
his side understood his words perfectly. She tossed her head in
denial and gave him a playful slap on the cheek. Christian
smiled.</p>

<p>"Young is right," he said; "when the true seaman leaves one
sweetheart he is already looking forward to the next! But I find it
hard to practise what I preach!"</p>

<p>Toward evening our guests left us to return to the ship, and I
was forced to follow them the next day. I took leave of Hitihiti
and his household with sincere regret, fully convinced that I
should never see any one of them again.</p>

<p>I found the <i>Bounty</i> crowded with Indians, and loaded with
coconuts, plantains, hogs, and goats. The great chief Teina and his
wife were the captain's guests and slept on the ship that night. At
daybreak we worked out through the narrow Toaroa passage, and stood
off and on all day, while Bligh took leave of Teina and made up his
parting gifts to the chief. Just before sunset the launch was sent
ashore with Teina and Itea, while we manned the ship with all hands
and gave them three hearty cheers. An hour later the helm was put
up and the <i>Bounty</i> stood off shore with all sail set.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c8" id="c8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;HOMEWARD
BOUND</h2>

<p>Now that we were at sea again, I had time to observe the change
that had come over the ship's company as a result of our long
island sojourn. In colour we were almost as brown as the Indians,
and most of us were tattooed on various parts of our bodies with
strange designs that added to our exotic appearance. The Tahitians
are wonderfully skilled at tattooing, and although the process of
acquiring it is both slow and painful, there were few of the men
who had not been willing to undergo the torture for the sake of
carrying home such evidence of their adventures in the South Sea.
Edward Young was the most completely decorated of the midshipmen.
On either leg he carried the design of a coconut tree, the trunk
beginning at the heel and the foliage spreading out over the fleshy
part of the calf. Encircling the thighs were wide bands of
conventionalized design, and on his back he had the picture of a
breadfruit tree, done with such spirit that one could all but hear
the rustle of the wind through its branches.</p>

<p>In addition to such pictures, there was scarcely a man on the
ship who had not acquired some words and phrases of the Tahitian
language, which they took care to use in their talk with one
another. A few had become remarkably proficient, and could carry on
conversations in which scarcely a word of English was to be heard.
All of them had pieces of the Indian cloth, and it was a curious
sight, in the early mornings when they were washing down the decks,
to see them at their work dressed only in turbans of tapa, with a
strip of the same material about their loins, and jabbering away
with great fluency in the Indian tongue. An Englishman fresh from
home would hardly have recognized them as fellow countrymen.</p>

<p>There was an inward change as noticeable to any thoughtful
observer as these outward ones. Duties were performed as usual, but
there was little heartiness displayed, and this applied to some of
the officers as well as to the men. Never, I fancy, has one of His
Majesty's ships been worked homeward, after long absence, with less
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>I was talking of this matter one day with Mr. Nelson, who was
always to be found during the daylight hours in the great cabin,
looking after his beloved breadfruit plants. I felt vaguely uneasy
at this time, and it was always a comforting experience to talk
with Mr. Nelson. He was one of those men who are truly called the
salt of the earth, and was a rock of peace in our somewhat
turbulent ship's company. I confessed that I was disturbed, without
knowing exactly why, at the way the ship's work was going on.
Nelson thought there was nothing to be concerned about.</p>

<p>"Does it seem strange to you, my dear fellow, that we should all
feel a little let down after our idyllic life at Tahiti? I am
surprised that the men show as much willingness as they do. My own
feelings as I think of England ahead of us and Tahiti behind are
decidedly mixed ones. Yours must be, too."</p>

<p>"I admit that they are," I replied.</p>

<p>"Imagine, then, how the men must feel, who have so little to go
home to. What have they to expect at the end of the voyage? Before
they have been a week ashore most of them may be seized by some
press gang as recruits for another of His Majesty's ships. Who
knows what the situation may be by the time the <i>Bounty</i>
reaches England? We may be at war with France, or Spain, or
Holland, or heaven knows what power; and in that case, alas for any
poor seamen arriving in a home port! They won't even be given the
chance to spend their back pay. The sailor leads a dog's life,
Byam, and no mistake."</p>

<p>"Do you think war with France is likely?" I asked.</p>

<p>"War with France is always likely," he replied, smiling. "If I
were an A.B. I should curse the thought of any war. Think what a
paradise Tahiti has been for our men. For once in their lives they
have been treated as human beings. They have had abundant food,
easy duties, and unlimited opportunities for the sailor's chief
distraction, women. I confess that I was surprised, before we left
Tahiti, that the lot of them didn't take to the hills. Certainly I
should have done so had I been in any of their places."</p>

<p>As the days passed, and we left Tahiti farther and farther
astern, the memory of our life there seemed like that of a dream,
and gradually, one by one, we fell into the old routine. No unhappy
incidents occurred to mar the peace of that period. Captain Bligh
took his regular turns on the quarter-deck, but he rarely spoke to
anyone, and most of his time was spent in his cabin, where he was
busy working on his charts of the islands. So all went quietly
enough until the morning of April 23, when we sighted the island of
Namuka, in the Friendly Archipelago. Bligh had been here before,
with Captain Cook, and it was his intention to replenish our wood
and water before proceeding in the direction of Endeavour
Straits.</p>

<p>The wind being to the southward, we had some difficulty in
making the land, and it was not until late afternoon that we came
to anchor in the road, in twenty-three fathoms. The island was much
less romantic in appearance than Tahiti or any of the Society
Islands that we had seen, but I was conscious of the same feeling
of awe and wonder I had experienced elsewhere as I looked upon
lands which only a handful of white men had ever seen, and whose
very existence, to say nothing of their names, was unknown to
people at home.</p>

<p>On the morning of the twenty-fourth we weighed and worked more
to the eastward, and again anchored a mile and a half from shore,
at a more convenient place for our watering parties. By this time
the arrival of the ship was known far and wide on shore, and the
Indians were arriving not only from various parts of Namuka, but
from neighbouring islands as well. We had scarcely come to our new
anchorage before we were surrounded with canoes, and our decks were
so filled with people that we had difficulty in performing our
duties. At first the confusion was great, but order was established
when two chiefs came aboard whom Bligh remembered from his visit in
1777. We were able to make them understand that the decks must be
cleared, and they set about it in so resolute and impetuous a
manner that soon all of the Indians, except those in the chiefs'
retinues, were again in their canoes. Captain Bligh then called me
to him to act as interpreter, but I found that my study of the
Tahitian language was of little service here. The Friendly Island
speech, although it has points of resemblance, differs greatly from
the Tahitian. However, with the aid of signs and an occasional word
or phrase, we explained our purpose in corning, and, the chiefs
having shouted some orders to their people, most of the canoes made
speedily for shore.</p>

<p>It was Captain Cook who had given the name, "The Friendly
Islands," to this archipelago, but my own impressions of its
inhabitants were far from favourable. They resembled the Tahitians
in stature, the colour of the skin and hair, and it was plain that
they belonged to the same great family; but there was an insolent
boldness in their behaviour lacking in the deportment of the
Tahitians. They were thieves of the worst order and, if offered the
slightest opportunity, would seize whatever loose article lay
nearest and leap overboard with it. Christian was strongly of the
opinion that they were not to be trusted in any respect, and
suggested that a strong guard accompany the parties to be sent
ashore for wood and water. Captain Bligh laughed at the notion.</p>

<p>"Surely you're not afraid of the beggars, Mr. Christian?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, but I think we have reason to be cautious in our
dealings with them. In my opinion..."</p>

<p>He was not permitted to finish.</p>

<p>"And who's asked you for your opinion? Damme! If I haven't an
old woman for my second-in-command! Come, Mr. Nelson, we must do
something to reassure these timid souls," and he went down the
ladder to the cutter that was waiting to row him ashore. Mr. Nelson
followed&mdash;he was to collect some breadfruit plants to replace
several that had died during the voyage&mdash;and the party,
including the two chiefs, set out for the beach.</p>

<p>This little scene had taken place before many of the ship's
company, and I could see that Christian had controlled his temper
with difficulty. Mr. Bligh had the unfortunate habit of making such
humiliating remarks to his officers, no matter who might be within
hearing. It may be said in his defense, perhaps, that, being a
thick-skinned man, he had no conception of how galling such remarks
could be, particularly to a man like Christian.</p>

<p>As it chanced, nothing unusual happened that day. The fact that
Mr. Bligh had gone off with two of the chiefs was a guarantee that
his party would not be molested. Later in the day, the natives came
off to trade, bringing the usual island produce&mdash;pigs, fowls,
coconuts, yams, and plantains. The afternoon and the whole of the
following day were given up to this business, and the third morning
the wood and watering parties were sent ashore in Christian's
charge. It was then that his distrust of the Indians proved fully
justified, for we had no sooner set foot on the beach than they
began to make trouble for us. Mr. Bligh had not refused to send a
guard with the ship's boats, but he had given strict orders that
the arms were not to be used. Hayward was in charge of the cutter
and I of the launch, and Christian went with the shore parties. The
Indians thronged to the watering place, several hundred yards from
the beach. Every effort was made to keep them at a distance, but
they became increasingly bold as the work went on, and we had not
been half an hour ashore before several of the sailors, who were
cutting wood, had had their axes snatched from their hands.
Christian performed his work admirably, in the opinion of all the
shore party, and it was thanks to his coolness that we were not
rushed and overwhelmed by the savages. They outnumbered us fifty to
one. We managed to get down our wood and water without coming to a
pitched battle, but when we were getting off, toward sundown, they
rushed us and managed to make off with the grapnel of the
cutter.</p>

<p>When we arrived on board and our losses were reported by
Christian, Captain Bligh flew into a rage, cursing him in language
that would have been out of place had he been speaking to a common
sailor.</p>

<p>"You are an incompetent cowardly rascal, sir! Damn me if you're
not! Are you afraid of a crowd of bloody savages whilst you have
arms in your hands?"</p>

<p>"Of what service are they, sir, when you forbid their use?"
Christian asked quietly. Bligh ignored this question and continued
to pour out such a flood of abuse that Christian turned abruptly
and left him, going down to his cabin. When in one of his rages
Bligh seemed insane. I had never before met a man of this kind, and
my conclusion was, having observed him so often in this state, that
he had little recollection, afterward, of what he had said or done.
I observed that he frequently worked himself into these passions
over matters for which he was really to blame. Being unwilling to
admit a fault in his own conduct, it seemed necessary to convince
himself, through anger, that the blame lay elsewhere.</p>

<p>Usually, after Bligh had given vent to a fit of this sort, we
could promise ourselves several days of calm, during which time he
would have little or nothing to say to us, but it chanced that the
following day a similar incident occurred which was to have the
gravest consequences for all of us. I am no believer in fate. Men's
actions, in so far as their relationships with one another are
concerned, are largely under their own control; but there are times
when malicious powers seem to order our small human affairs for
their own amusement, and one of these occasions must surely have
been on the twenty-seventh day of April, in the year 1789.</p>

<p>We had sailed from Namuka on the evening of the twenty-sixth
and, the wind being light, had made but little progress during the
night. All of the following day we were within seven or eight
leagues of the land. The supplies we had received from the Indians
were being stored away, and the carpenters were making pens for the
pigs and crates for the fowls not intended for early use. Mr. Bligh
had kept to his cabin all the morning, but early in the afternoon
he appeared on deck to give some instructions to Mr. Samuel, who
was in charge of the work of sorting over our purchases at Namuka.
A great many coconuts had been piled up on the quarter-deck between
the guns, and Bligh, who knew to the last ounce how many yams we
had purchased, and the exact number of coconuts, discovered that a
few of the latter were missing. He may have been told of this by
Samuel, but at any rate he knew it.</p>

<p>He ordered all the officers to come on deck immediately, and
questioned each of them as to the number of coconuts he had bought
on his own account, and whether or not he had seen any one of the
men helping himself to those on the quarter-deck. All denied having
any such knowledge, and Bligh, doubtless thinking that the officers
were shielding the men, became more and more angry. At length he
came to Christian.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Christian, I wish to know the exact number of coconuts
you purchased for your own use."</p>

<p>"I really don't know, sir," Christian replied, "but I hope you
don't think me so mean as to be guilty of stealing yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you bloody hound! I <i>do</i> think so! You must have
stolen some of mine or you would be able to give a better account
of your own. You're damned rascals and thieves, the lot of you!
You'll be stealing my yams next, or have the men steal them for
you! But I'll make you suffer! I'll teach you to steal, you dogs!
I'll break the spirit of every man of you! You'll wish you'd never
seen me before we reach Endeavour Straits!"</p>

<p>Of all the humiliating scenes that had taken place up to that
time, this was the worst; and yet, considering the nature of the
offense committed, there was something meanly comic about it.
Christian, however, could not see this side of the matter, and
small wonder that he could not. No other captain in His Majesty's
service would have made such an accusation against his
second-in-command, to say nothing of his other officers. Bligh
stamped up and down the quarter-deck, his face distorted with
passion, shaking his fists and shouting at us as though we were at
the other end of the ship. Of a sudden he stopped. "Mr.
Samuel!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Samuel, stepping forward.</p>

<p>"You'll stop the villains' grog until further orders. And
instead of a pound of yams per man you'll issue half a pound to all
the messes. Understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And, by God, I'll reduce you to a quarter of a pound if I find
anything else missing, and make you crawl on your bellies for
that!" He then gave orders that all of the coconuts, belonging to
officers and men alike, be carried aft to add to the ship's stores.
When this had been done he returned to his cabin.</p>

<p>I never remember the ship to have been more silent than she was
that evening. Most of us, doubtless, were thinking of the long
voyage ahead. Another year might pass before the <i>Bounty</i>
could reach England. Meanwhile we should be under the heavy hand of
a captain who could do with us as he pleased; against whose tyranny
there could be no appeal. My own mess was particularly silent, for
at this time Samuel was a member of it, and we knew that anything
we might say would be quickly carried to Captain Bligh. Peckover
ate his salt junk and, his half a pound of yams in a few savage
bites, and withdrew. The rest of us were not long in following.</p>

<p>Mr. Fryer's watch came on at eight o'clock. Most of the ship's
company were on deck during the early hours, owing to the fineness
of the evening. The breeze had been light all day and remained so;
we had no more than steerageway, but the air was refreshingly cool.
The moon was in its first quarter, and by its light we could dimly
see, far ahead, the outline of the island of Tofoa.</p>

<p>Between ten and eleven Bligh came on deck to leave his orders
for the night. He paced up and down the quarter-deck for some time,
paying no attention to anyone. Presently he stopped near Fryer, who
ventured to say: "Sir, I think we shall have a fine breeze by and
by. This moon coming on will be fortunate for us when we approach
the coast of New Holland."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Fryer, so it will," he replied. A few minutes later he
gave his orders as to the course to be steered, and returned to his
cabin. Fryer's prediction of wind was not to be fulfilled. At
midnight, when our watch went off duty, the sea was like a mill
pond, with a glassy sheen upon the water, reflecting the Southern
constellations. Going below, I found it much too hot for sleep.
Tinkler and I came on deck together and stood for a while by the
rail aft, talking of home and what we would choose for our first
meal on shore. Presently, looking around cautiously, he said:
"Byam, do you know that I am a double-dyed villain? I stole one of
Mr. Bligh's missing coconuts."</p>

<p>"So it's you we have to thank for our dressing-down, you little
rascal," I replied.</p>

<p>"Alas, yes. I'm one of the damned rogues and thieves. I could
tell you the names of two others, but I forbear. We were thirsty
and too lazy to go to the main top for the gun barrel. And there
were the coconuts, such a tempting sight, a great heap of them
between the guns on the quarter-deck. I wish they were there now;
I'd steal another. There's nothing more refreshing than coconut
water. Curse old Nelson's breadfruit garden! It keeps a man thirsty
all the time."</p>

<p>We were all, in fact, envious of our breadfruit plants. Whatever
happened, they had to be watered regularly, and in order to cut
down the amount drunk by the ship's company Bligh had thought of a
very excellent and ingenious arrangement to prevent us from
quenching our thirst too often. Any man who wanted a drink had
first to climb to the main top to fetch a gun barrel left there. He
then climbed down with this to the scuttle butt, outside the
galley, inserted the gun barrel into the bunghole, and, having
sucked up his drink, he was required to carry the drinking tube to
the main top again. No man, no matter how thirsty he might be, was
permitted to make more than two of these gun-barrel climbs during
his watch, and a lazy man did without his drink until thirst got
the better of him.</p>

<p>"God be thanked! For once I wasn't suspected," Tinkler went on.
"How do you explain that? If he had asked me I should have denied,
of course, that I'd had anything to do with his rotten coconuts.
But I'm afraid my guilty conscience might have given me away this
time. I was so damned sorry for Christian."</p>

<p>"Did Christian know that you had taken some of the nuts?"</p>

<p>"Not some&mdash;only one, mind you! As I've told you, there were
fellow conspirators. Of course he did. In fact, he saw me do it and
looked the other way, as any decent officer was bound to do. It
wasn't as though we were endangering the safety of the vessel. Four
coconuts missing, that's all&mdash;I give you my word. Four out of
how many thousands? And I was responsible for only one. Well, if I
sleep over my sins, perhaps they won't seem so black
to-morrow."</p>

<p>Tinkler was like the ship's cat; he could curl up anywhere for a
nap. He now lay down by one of the quarter-deck guns, with his arm
for a pillow, and, as I thought, was soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>It was then about one o'clock, and with the exception of the
watch there was no one on deck but Tinkler and myself. Mr. Peckover
was standing at the rail on the opposite side of the deck. I could
make out his form dimly in the starlight. Someone appeared at the
after ladder-way. It was Christian. After half a dozen turns up and
down the deck, he observed me standing between the guns.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, Byam?" He came and stood beside me, his elbows on
the rail. I had not seen him since the affair of the afternoon.</p>

<p>At length he asked, "Did you know that he had invited me to sup
with him? Why? Can you tell me that? After spitting on me, wiping
his feet on me, he sent Samuel to ask me to eat at his table!"</p>

<p>"You didn't go?"</p>

<p>"After what had happened? God in heaven, no!"</p>

<p>I had never before seen a man in a mood of such black despair.
He seemed at the last extremity of endurance. I was glad to be
there, to be of service as a confidant, for it was plain that he
was in desperate need of unburdening himself. That Bligh should
have asked him to supper was, in truth, all but incredible, after
the events of the afternoon. I suggested that it might be taken as
evidence of an unsuspected delicacy of conscience in Bligh, but I
believed this no more than did Christian himself.</p>

<p>"We're in his power. Officers and men alike, he considers us so
many dogs to be kicked or fondled according to his whim. And there
can be no relief. None. Not till we reach England. God knows when
that will be!"</p>

<p>He was silent for some time, staring gloomily out over the
starlit sea. At length he said, "Byam, there's something I wish you
would do for me."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"The chances are there'll be no occasion, but on a long voyage
like this one never knows what may happen. If, for any reason, I
should fail to reach home, I'd like you to see my people in
Cumberland. Would that be too much trouble for you?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," I replied.</p>

<p>"During the last conversation I had with my father, just before
I joined the ship, he asked that I make such an arrangement with
someone aboard the <i>Bounty</i>. In case anything should happen,
he said that it would be a comfort to him to talk with one of my
friends. I promised, and I've let half the voyage pass without
fulfilling it. I feel better now that I have spoken."</p>

<p>"You can count on me," I said, shaking his hand.</p>

<p>"Good! That's settled, then."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Christian! You're up late."</p>

<p>We turned quickly to find Bligh standing a yard away. He was
barefoot and dressed only in his shirt and trousers. Neither of us
had heard him approach.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Christian replied, coldly.</p>

<p>"And you, Mr. Byam. Can't you sleep?"</p>

<p>"It's very warm below, sir."</p>

<p>"I hadn't noticed it. A true sailor can sleep in an oven if the
case requires. Or on a cake of ice."</p>

<p>He stood there for a moment as though expecting us to make some
reply; then he turned abruptly and walked to the ladderway, halting
to glance at the trim of the sails before going below again.
Christian and I talked in desultory fashion for a brief time; then
he bade me good-night and went forward somewhere.</p>

<p>Tinkler, who had been lying in deep shadow by one of the guns,
sat up and stretched his arms with a deep yawn.</p>

<p>"Go below, Byam, and show that you are a true seaman. Damn you
and Christian and your gabble! I was just getting drowsy when he
came along."</p>

<p>"Did you hear what he said?" I asked.</p>

<p>"About notifying his father in case anything happened? Yes; I
couldn't help eavesdropping. My father made no such request of
me&mdash;which only goes to show that he has no hope of my not
coming back. I must have a drink. I've been thinking of nothing but
water this past hour, and I'm not entitled to one before morning.
What would you do, in my case?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Peckover has just gone below for a moment," I said. "You
might chance it."</p>

<p>"Has he?" Tinkler leaped to his feet. He ran up the shrouds for
the gun barrel and had carried it aloft again before Peckover
returned. As we went below together I heard three bells strike, and
the far-off call of the lookout in the foretop: "All's well!" I
settled myself in my hammock and was soon asleep.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c9" id="c9"></a>CHAPTER IX.&mdash;THE MUTINY</h2>

<p>Shortly after daybreak I was awakened by someone shaking me
roughly by the shoulder, and at the same time I was aware of loud
voices, Mr. Bligh's among them, and the heavy trampling of feet on
deck. Churchill, the master-at-arms, stood by my hammock with a
pistol in his hand, and I saw Thompson, holding a musket with the
bayonet fixed, stationed by the arms chest which stood on the
gratings of the main hatch: At the same time two men, whose names I
do not remember, rushed into the berth, and one of them shouted,
"We're with you, Churchill! Give us arms!" They were furnished with
muskets by Thompson and hurried on deck again. Stewart, whose
hammock was next to mine in the larboard berth, was already up and
dressing in great haste. Despite the confused tumult of voices
overhead, Young was still asleep.</p>

<p>"Have we been attacked, Churchill?" I asked; for my first
thought was that the <i>Bounty</i> must have drifted close to one
of the islands thereabout, and that we had been boarded by the
savages.</p>

<p>"Put on your clothes and lose no time about it, Mr. Byam," he
replied. "We have taken the ship and Captain Bligh is a
prisoner."</p>

<p>Aroused suddenly from the deepest slumber, I did not even then
grasp the meaning of what he said, and for a moment sat gazing
stupidly at him.</p>

<p>"They've mutinied, Byam!" said Stewart. "Good God, Churchill!
Are you mad? Have you any conception of what you're doing?"</p>

<p>"We know very well what we're doing," he replied. "Bligh has
brought all this on himself. Now, by God, we'll make him suffer!"
Thompson shook his musket in menacing fashion. "We're going to
shoot the dog!" he said; "and don't you try any of your young
gentlemen's tricks on us, or we'll murder some more of you! Seize
'em up, Churchill! They're not to be trusted."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue and mind the arms chest," Churchill replied.
"Come, Mr. Byam, hurry into your clothes. Quintal, stand fast by
the door there! No one's to come forward without my
orders&mdash;understand?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!"</p>

<p>Turning my head, I saw Matthew Quintal at the rear entrance to
the berth. Even as I looked, Samuel appeared behind him, dressed
only in his trousers, his thin hair standing awry and his pale face
considerably paler than its wont. "Mr. Churchill!" he called.</p>

<p>"Go back, you fat swine, or I'll run you through the guts!"
Quintal shouted.</p>

<p>"Mr. Churchill, sir! Allow me to speak to you," Samuel called
again.</p>

<p>"Drive him back," Churchill said, and Quintal made so fierce a
gesture with his musket that Samuel vanished without waiting to
hear more. "Give him a prod in the backside, Quintal," someone
shouted, and, looking up, I saw two more armed men leaning over the
hatchway.</p>

<p>Without weapons of any sort, there was nothing that Stewart and
I could do but obey Churchill's orders. Both he and Thompson were
powerful men and we should have been no match for them even had
they been unarmed. I immediately thought of. Christian, a man as
quick in action as in decision, but I knew there could be no hope
of his still being at liberty. He was the officer of the morning
watch and had doubtless been rushed and overwhelmed at the very
outset of the mutiny, even before Bligh had been secured. Catching
my eye, Stewart shook his head slightly, as much as to say, "It's
useless. There's nothing to be done."</p>

<p>We dressed in short order, and Churchill then ordered us to
precede him along the passage to the fore ladderway. "Keep the
others in the berth, Thompson," he called back. "Leave 'em to me;
I'll mind 'em!" Thompson replied. There were several armed guards
at the fore-hatch, among them Alexander Smith, my hammock man,
whose loyalty in whatever situation I should have thought
unquestionable. It was a shock to see him in Churchill's party, but
the scene that presented itself as we came on deck made me forget
the very existence of Smith.</p>

<p>Captain Bligh, naked except for his shirt, and with his hands
tied behind his back, was standing by the mizzenmast. Christian
stood before him, holding in one hand the end of the line by which
Bligh was bound and in the other a bayonet, and around them were
several of the able seamen, fully armed, among whom I recognized
John Mills, Isaac Martin, Richard Skinner, and Thomas Burkitt.
Churchill then said to us, "Stand by here. We mean no harm to
either of you unless you take part against us." He then left
us.</p>

<p>Stewart and I had taken it for granted that Churchill was the
ringleader of the mutineers. As already related, after his
attempted desertion at Tahiti he had been severely punished by
Bligh. I knew how deeply he hated him, and it was conceivable that
such a man could goad himself even to the point of mutiny. But that
Christian could have done so, no matter what the provocation, was
beyond anything I could have dreamed of as possible. Stewart's only
comment was, "Christian! Good God! Then there's no hope."</p>

<p>The situation looked hopeless indeed. At this time the only
unarmed men I saw on deck were Captain Bligh and ourselves. The
ship was entirely in the hands of the mutineers. Evidently we had
been brought up to divide the party of midshipmen below, thus
preventing any opportunity for our taking concerted action. In the
confusion we made our way aft a little way, and as we approached
the spot where Bligh was standing, I heard Christian say, "Will you
hold your tongue, sir, or shall I force you to hold it? I'm master
of this ship now, and, by God, I'll stand no more of your abuse!"
Sweat was pouring down Bligh's face. He had been making a great
outcry, shouting, "Murder! Treason!" at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>"Master of my ship, you mutinous dog!" he yelled. "I'll see you
hung! I'll have you flogged to ribbons! I'll..."</p>

<p>"<i>Mamu</i>, sir! Hold your tongue or you are dead this
instant!"</p>

<p>Christian placed the point of his bayonet at Bligh's throat with
a look in his eye there was no mistaking. "Slit the dog's gullet!"
someone shouted; and there were cries of "Let him have it, Mr.
Christian!"</p>

<p>"Throw him overboard!"</p>

<p>"Feed the bastard to the sharks!" and the like. It was only
then, I think, that Captain Bligh realized his true situation. He
stood for a moment breathing hard, looking about him with an
expression of incredulity on his face.</p>

<p>"Mr. Christian, allow me to speak!" he begged hoarsely. "Think
what you do! Release me&mdash;lay aside your arms! Let us be
friends again, and I give you my word that nothing more shall be
said of this matter."</p>

<p>"Your word is of no value, sir," Christian replied. "Had you
been a man of honour things would never have come to this
pass."</p>

<p>"What do you mean to do with me?"</p>

<p>"Shoot you, you bloody rogue!" cried Burkitt, shaking his musket
at him.</p>

<p>"Shooting's too good for him! Seize him up at the gratings, Mr.
Christian! Give us a chance at him with the cat!"</p>

<p>"That's it! Seize him up! Give him a taste of his own
poison!"</p>

<p>"Flay the hide off him!"</p>

<p>"Silence!" Christian called, sternly; and then, to Bligh: "We'll
give you justice, sir, which is more than you have ever given us.
We'll take you in irons to England..."</p>

<p>A dozen protesting voices interrupted him.</p>

<p>"To England? Never! We won't have it, Mr. Christian!"</p>

<p>Immediately the deck was again in an uproar, all the mutineers
clamouring against Christian's proposal. Never was the situation
with respect to Bligh so critical as at that moment, and it was to
his credit that he showed no sign of flinching. The men were in a
savage mood, and it was touch and go as to whether he would be shot
where he stood; but he glared at each of them in turn as though
challenging them to do so. Luckily a diversion was created when
Ellison came dashing up flourishing a bayonet. There was no real
harm in this lad, but he loved mischief better than his dinner,
and, being thoughtless and high-spirited, he could be counted upon
to get himself into trouble whenever the opportunity presented
itself. Evidently he considered joining in a mutiny nothing more
than a fine lark, and he now came dancing up to Bligh with such a
comical expression upon his face that the tension was relieved at
once. The men broke into cheers. "Hooray, Tommy! Are you with us,
lad?"</p>

<p>"Let me guard him, Mr. Christian!" he cried. "I'll watch him
like a cat!" He skipped up and down in front of Bligh, brandishing
his weapon. "Oh, you rogue! You old villain! You'd flog us, would
you? You'd stop our grog, would you? You'd make us eat grass, would
you?"</p>

<p>The men cheered him wildly. "Lay on, lad!" they shouted. "We'll
back you! Give him a jab in the guts!"</p>

<p>"You and your Mr. Samuel! A pair of swindlers, that's what you
are! Cheating us out of our food! You've made a pretty penny
between you! You old thief! You should be a bumboat man. I'll lay
you'd make your fortune in no time!"</p>

<p>It was a bitter experience for Bligh to be baited thus by the
least of his seamen, but as a matter of fact nothing more fortunate
for him could have happened. His life at that moment hung in the
balance, and Ellison, in giving vent to his feelings, relieved the
pent-up emotions of men who were not glib of speech and could
express their hatred of Bligh only in action. Christian realized
this, I think, and permitted Ellison to speak his mind, but he soon
cut him short and put him in his place.</p>

<p>"Clear the cutter!" he called. "Mr. Churchill!"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!"</p>

<p>"Fetch up Mr. Fryer and Mr. Purcell! Burkitt!"</p>

<p>"Here, sir!"</p>

<p>"You and Sumner and Mills and Martin&mdash;stand guard here over
Mr. Bligh."</p>

<p>Burkitt took the end of the line in one of his huge hairy fists.
"We'll mind him, sir! I'll lay to that!"</p>

<p>"What's your plan, Mr. Christian? We've a right to know," said
Sumner. Christian turned quickly and looked at him. "Mind what
you're about, Sumner!" he said quietly. "I'm master of this ship!
Lively, men, with the cutter."</p>

<p>Several men climbed into the boat to clear out the yams, sweet
potatoes, and other ship's stores which were kept there, while
others unlashed it and got ready the tackle for hoisting it over
the side. Burkitt stood directly in front of Captain Bligh, holding
the point of a bayonet within an inch of his breast. Sumner stood
behind him with his musket at ready, and the other men on either
side. Thompson excepted, they were the hardest characters among the
sailors, and Bligh wisely said nothing to arouse them further.
Others of the mutineers were stationed about the decks, and there
were three at each of the ladderways. I wondered how the affair had
been so well and secretly planned. I searched my memory, but could
recall no incident of a character in the least suspicious.</p>

<p>I had been so intent in watching the scene of which Bligh was
the centre that I had forgotten Stewart. We had become separated,
and while I was searching for him Christian saw me for the first
time. He came at once to where I was standing. His voice was calm,
but I could see that he was labouring under great excitement.</p>

<p>"Byam, this is my affair," he said. "Not a man shall be hurt,
but if any take part against us it will be at the peril of the
entire ship's company. Act as you think best."</p>

<p>"What do you mean to do?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I would have carried Bligh to England as a prisoner. That is
impossible; the men won't have it. He shall have the cutter to go
where he chooses. Mr. Fryer, Hayward, Hallet, and Samuel shall go
with him."</p>

<p>There was no time for further talk. Churchill came up with the
master and Purcell. The carpenter, as usual, was surly and
taciturn. Both he and Fryer were horror-stricken at what had
happened, but they were entirely self-possessed. Christian well
knew that these two men would seize the first opportunity, if one
presented itself, for retaking the ship, and he had them well
guarded.</p>

<p>"Mr. Byam, surely you are not concerned in this?" Fryer asked.
"No more than yourself, sir," I replied.</p>

<p>"Mr. Byam has nothing to do with it," said Christian. "Mr.
Purcell..."</p>

<p>Fryer interrupted him.</p>

<p>"In God's name, Mr. Christian! What is it you do? Do you realize
that this means the ruin of everything? Give up this madness, and I
promise that we shall all make your interest our own. Only let us
reach England..."</p>

<p>"It is too late, Mr. Fryer," he replied, coldly. "I have been in
hell for weeks past, and I mean to stand it no longer."</p>

<p>"Your difficulties with Captain Bligh give you no right to bring
ruin upon the rest of us."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, sir," said Christian. "Mr. Purcell, have your
men fetch up the thwarts, knees, and gear bolts for the large
cutter. Churchill, let the carpenter go below to see to this. Send
a guard with him."</p>

<p>Purcell and Churchill went down the forward ladderway. "Do you
mean to set us adrift?" Fryer asked.</p>

<p>"We are no more than nine leagues from the land here," Christian
replied. "In so calm a sea Mr. Bligh will have no difficulty in
making it."</p>

<p>"I will stay with the ship."</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Fryer; you will go with Captain Bligh. Williams! Take
the master to his cabin while he collects his clothes. He is to be
kept there until I send word."</p>

<p>Fryer requested earnestly to be allowed to remain with the
vessel, but Christian well knew his reason for desiring this and
would not hear to the proposal. He put an end to the matter by
sending the master below.</p>

<p>Purcell now returned, followed by Norman and McIntosh, his
mates, carrying the gear for the cutter. Purcell came up to me at
once.</p>

<p>"Mr. Byam, I know that you have no hand in this business. But
you are, or have been, a friend to Mr. Christian. Beg him to give
Captain Bligh the launch. The cutter is rotten and will never swim
to the land."</p>

<p>This, I knew, was the case. The cutter was riddled with worms
and leaked so badly as to be almost useless. The carpenters were to
have started repairing her that same morning. Purcell would not
come with me to speak of the matter, giving as a reason Christian's
dislike of him. "He would not care to grant any request of mine,"
he said. "If the cutter is hoisted out, it will be almost certain
death for Captain Bligh and all who are permitted to go with
him."</p>

<p>I wasted no time, but went to Christian at once. Several of the
mutineers gathered round to hear what I had to say. Christian
agreed at once. "He shall have the launch," he said. "Tell the
carpenter to have his men fit her." He then called, "Leave off with
the cutter, my lads! Clear the launch."'</p>

<p>There were immediate protests, led by Churchill, against this
new arrangement.</p>

<p>"The launch, Mr. Christian?"</p>

<p>"Don't let him have it, sir! The old fox'll get home in
her!"</p>

<p>"She's too bloody good for him!"</p>

<p>There was an argument over the matter, but Christian forced his
will upon the others. In fact, they made no determined stand. All
were eager to be rid of the captain, and they had little reason to
fear that he would ever see England again.</p>

<p>The mutineers were in such complete control of the situation
that Christian now gave orders for the rest of those who were not
of his party to be brought on deck. Samuel, Bligh's clerk, was
among the first to appear. He was anything but a favourite with the
ship's cormpany, and was greeted with jeers and threats by his
particular enemies. I had supposed that he would make a poor
showing in such a situation. On the contrary, he acted with spirit
and determination. Disregarding the insults of the sailors, he went
directly to Captain Bligh to receive his orders. He was permitted
to go to Bligh's cabin with John Smith, the captain's servant, to
fetch up his clothes. They helped him on with his boots and
trousers and laid his coat over his shoulders.</p>

<p>I saw Hayward and Hallet standing aft by the rail. Hallet was
crying, and both of them were in a state of great alarm. Someone
touched my shoulder and I found Mr. Nelson standing beside me.</p>

<p>"Well, Byam, I'm afraid that we're even farther from home than
we thought. Do you know what they plan to do with us?"</p>

<p>I told him the little I knew. He smiled ruefully, glancing
toward the island of Tofoa, now a faint blur on the horizon.</p>

<p>"I suppose that Captain Bligh will take us there," he said. "I
don't much relish the prospect of meeting any more Friendly
Islanders. Their friendliness is of a kind that we can well
dispense with."</p>

<p>The carpenter appeared at the ladderway, followed by Robert
Lamb, the butcher, who was helping to bring up his tool chest.</p>

<p>"Mr. Nelson," he said, "we know whom we have to thank for
this."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Purcell, our unlucky stars," Nelson replied.</p>

<p>"No, sir! We have Captain Bligh to thank for it, and him alone!
He has brought it upon us all by his damnable behaviour!"</p>

<p>Purcell had the deepest hatred for Bligh, which was returned
with interest. The two men had not spoken for months save when
absolutely necessary. Nevertheless, when Mr. Nelson suggested that
he might be permitted to stay with the ship if he chose, the
carpenter was horrified.</p>

<p>"Stop aboard? With rogues and pirates? Never, sir! I shall
follow my commander."</p>

<p>At this moment Churchill, who was everywhere about the decks,
caught sight of us.</p>

<p>"What are you about there, Purcell? Damn your blood! You'd steal
our tools, would you?"</p>

<p>"Your tools, you scoundrel? They're mine, and they go where I
go!"</p>

<p>"You shan't take a nail from the ship if I have my way,"
Churchill replied. He then called out to Christian, and there was
another argument, not only with respect to the tool chest, but as
to the carpenter himself. Christian was partly in the mind to keep
him on the vessel, knowing his value as a craftsman, but all the
others urged against it. Purcell had a violent temper and was
regarded by the men as a tyrant second only to Bligh.</p>

<p>"He's a damned old villain, sir!"</p>

<p>"Keep the carpenter's mates, Mr. Christian. They're the men for
us."</p>

<p>"Make him go in the boat!"</p>

<p>"Make me go, you pirates?" he cried. "I'd like to see the man
who'll <i>stop</i> me!"</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Purcell was as thick-headed as he was fearless,
and he now so far forgot the interests of Bligh's party as to boast
of what we would do as soon as we should be clear of the
mutineers.</p>

<p>"Mark my word, you rogues! We'll bring every man of you to
justice! We'll build a vessel to carry us home..."</p>

<p>"So he will, Mr. Christian, if we give him his tools," several
men shouted.</p>

<p>"The old fox could build a ship with a clasp knife!"</p>

<p>Purcell realized too late what he had done. I believe that
Christian would have given him many of his tools, of which there
were duplicates on board, but having been reminded of what he might
do with them, he now ordered the tool chest to be examined, and
Purcell was permitted to have nothing but a hand saw, a small axe,
a hammer, and a bag of nails. Bligh, who had overheard all that was
said, could contain himself no longer. "You infernal idiot!" he
roared at Purcell, and was prevented from saying more by Burkitt,
who placed a bayonet at his throat.</p>

<p>The decks were now filled with people, but Christian took good
care that those not of his party should be prevented from coming
together in any numbers. As soon as the launch had been cleared, he
ordered the boatswain to swing her out. "And mind yourself, Mr.
Cole! If you spring a yard or carry anything away it will go hard
with you!" Fifteen or more of us were ordered to assist him, for
the mutineers were too canny to lay aside their arms and bear a
hand.</p>

<p>"Foresail and mainsail there! All ready?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!"</p>

<p>"Let go sheets and tacks!"</p>

<p>"All clear, sir!"</p>

<p>"Clew garnets&mdash;up with the clews!"</p>

<p>The breeze was still so light as barely to fill the sails, and
the dews of the mainsail and foresail went smoothly up to the
quarters of the yards. The yards were now squared and the braces
made fast, and with half a dozen men holding the launch inboard she
was hoisted, swung out over the bulwarks, and lowered away.</p>

<p>One of the first men ordered into her was Samuel. Hayward and
Hallet followed next. Both were shedding tears and crying for
mercy, and they were half carried to the gangway. Hayward turned to
Christian, clasping his hands imploringly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Christian, what have I ever done that you should treat me
so?" he exclaimed. "In God's name, permit me to stay with the
ship!"</p>

<p>"We can dispense with your services here," Christian replied,
grimly. "Into the boat, the pair of you!"</p>

<p>Purcell went next. He required no urging. I think he would have
died rather than remain in the ship now that she had been seized by
mutineers. His few tools were handed down to him by the boatswain,
who followed. Christian ordered Bligh to be brought to the gangway,
and his hands were freed.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Bligh, there is your boat, and you are fortunate to
have the launch and not the cutter. Go into her at once, sir!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Christian," said Bligh, "for the last time I beg you to
reflect! I'll pawn my honour&mdash;I pledge you my word never to
think of this again if you will desist. Consider my wife and
family!"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Bligh. You should have thought of your family long
before this, and we well know what your honour is worth. Go into
the boat, sir!"</p>

<p>Seeing that all pleading was useless, Bligh obeyed, and was
followed by Mr. Peckover and Norton, the quartermaster. Christian
then handed down a sextant and a book of nautical tables.</p>

<p>"You have your compass, sir. This book is sufficient for every
purpose, and the sextant is my own. You know it to be a good one."
With his hands freed and once more in command, though only of his
ship's launch, Bligh became his old self again.</p>

<p>"I know you to be a bloody scoundrel!" he shouted, shaking his
fist in Christian's direction. "But I'll have vengeance! Mind that,
you ungrateful villain! I'll see you swinging at a yardarm before
two years have passed! And every traitor with you!"</p>

<p>Fortunately for Bligh, Christian's attention was engaged
elsewhere, but several of the mutineers at the bulwarks replied to
him in language as forceful as the captain's, and it was a near
thing that he was not fired upon.</p>

<p>In the confusion I had lost sight of Stewart. We had been
hauling together at one of the braces when the launch was hoisted
out, but now I could find him nowhere. It soon became clear that
many were to be allowed to go with Bligh, and Mr. Nelson and I, who
had been standing together by the bulwarks, were hastening toward
the after ladderway when we were stopped by Christian.</p>

<p>"Mr. Nelson, you and Mr. Byam may stay with the ship if you
choose," he said.</p>

<p>"I have sympathy with you for the wrongs you have suffered, Mr.
Christian," Nelson replied, "but none whatever with this action to
redress them."</p>

<p>"And when have I asked you for sympathy, sir? Mr. Byam, what is
your decision?"</p>

<p>"I shall go with Captain Bligh."</p>

<p>"Then make haste, both of you."</p>

<p>"Have we permission to fetch our clothes?" Nelson asked. "Yes,
but look sharp!"</p>

<p>Nelson's cabin was on the orlop deck directly below that of
Fryer. Two guards stood by the ladderway on the lower deck. We
parted there and I went to the midshipmen's berth, where Thompson
was still on guard over the arms chest. I had seen nothing of
Tinkler and Elphinstone, and was about to look into the starboard
berth to see if they were still there. Thompson prevented me.</p>

<p>"Never you mind the starboard berth," he said. "Get your clothes
and clear out!"</p>

<p>The berth was screened off from the main hatchway by a
canvas-covered framework. To my surprise, I found Young still
asleep in his hammock. He had been on watch from twelve to four,
and this was his customary time for rest, but it was strange that
he could have slept through such a turmoil. I tried to rouse him,
but he was a notoriously heavy sleeper. Finding the matter
hopeless, I left off and began to ransack my chest for things I
should most need. Stacked in the corner of the berth were several
Friendly Island war clubs that we had obtained from the savages of
Namuka. They had been carved from the toa, or ironwood tree, which
well deserved its name, for in weight and texture the wood was
indeed like iron. At the sight of them the thought flashed into my
mind, "Could I strike Thompson down with one of these?" I glanced
quickly out the doorway. Thompson was now seated on the arms chest
with his musket between his knees, facing the passageway leading
aft. But he saw me thrust out my head and, with an oath, ordered me
to "look sharp and clear out of there."</p>

<p>At this moment Morrison came along the passageway, and as luck
would have it Thompson's attention was attracted by someone calling
him from above. I beckoned Morrison into the berth, and he dodged
in without having been seen. There was no need for words. I handed
him one of the war clubs and took another for myself; then,
together, we made a last effort to waken Young. Not daring to
speak, we nearly shook him out of his hammock, but we might have
spared ourselves the trouble. I heard Thompson call out, "He's
getting his clothes, sir. I'll have him up at once." Morrison drew
back by the door and raised his club, and I stood at ready on the
other side, for we both expected Thompson to come in for me.
Instead of that he shouted, "Out of there, Byam, and be quick about
it!"</p>

<p>"I'm coming," I called, and again looked out of the doorway. My
heart sank as I saw Burkitt and McCoy coming along from the fore
hatchway. They stopped by the arms chest to speak to Thompson. Both
had muskets, of course. Our chance to get at Thompson and the arms
chest was lost unless they should pass on. Fortune was against us.
We waited for at least two minutes longer and the men remained
where they were. I heard Nelson's voice calling down the hatchway:
"Byam! Lively there, lad, or you'll be left behind!" And Tinkler's:
"For God's sake, hasten, Byam!"</p>

<p>It was a bitter moment for Morrison and me. The opportunity had
been a poor one at best, but had there been time something might
have come of it. We quickly put the war clubs aside and rushed out,
colliding with Thompson, who was coming to see what I was
about.</p>

<p>"Damn your blood, Morrison! What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>We didn't wait to explain, but ran along the passage to the
ladder-way. Morrison preceded me, and in my haste to reach the
deck, cumbered as I was with my bag of clothes, I slipped and fell
halfway down the ladder, giving my shoulder a wrench as I struck
the gratings. I clambered up again and was rushing toward the
gangway when Churchill seized me. "You're too late, Byam," he said.
"You can't go." "Can't go? By God, I <i>will!</i>" I exclaimed,
giving him a shove which loosened his hold and all but toppled him
over. I was frantic, for I saw the launch being veered astern, one
of the mutineers carrying the painter aft. Burkitt and Quintal were
holding Coleman, the armourer, who was begging to go into the boat,
and Morrison was struggling with several men who were keeping him
back from the gangway. We were, in fact, too late; the launch was
loaded almost to the point of foundering, and I heard Bligh
shouting: "I can take no more of you, lads! I'll do you justice if
ever we reach England!"</p>

<p>When the launch had drifted astern, the man holding the painter
took a turn with it around the rail and threw the free end to
someone in the boat. Those left in the ship now crowded along the
rail, and I had difficulty in finding a place where I could look
over the side. I was sick at heart, and appalled at the realization
that I was, indeed, to be left behind among the mutineers. Norton
was in the bow of the launch holding the end of the painter. Bligh
was standing on a thwart, astern. Of the others, some were seated
and some were standing, and the boat was so heavily loaded as to
have no more than seven or eight inches of freeboard. There was a
great deal of shouting back and forth, and Bligh was contributing
his full share to the tumult by bellowing out orders to those in
the boat, and curses and imprecations against Christian and his
men.</p>

<p>Some of the mutineers looked on silently and thoughtfully, but
others were jeering at Bligh, and I heard one of them shout: "Go
and see if you can live on half a pound of yams a day, you bloody
villain!" Fryer called out, "In God's name, Mr. Christian, give us
arms and ammunition! Think where we go! Let us have a chance to
defend our lives!" Others, the boatswain among them, joined
earnestly in this plea.</p>

<p>"Arms be damned!" someone shouted back.</p>

<p>"You don't need 'em."</p>

<p>"Old Bligh loves the savages. He'll take care of you!"</p>

<p>"Use your rattan on 'em, boatswain!"</p>

<p>Coleman and I sought out Christian, who was standing by one of
the cabin gratings, out of sight of the launch. We begged him to
let Bligh have some muskets and ammunition.</p>

<p>"Never!" he said. "They shall have no firearms."</p>

<p>"Then give them some cutlasses at least, Mr. Christian," Coleman
urged, "unless you wish them to be murdered the moment they set
foot on shore. Think of our experience at Namuka!"</p>

<p>Christian consented to this. He ordered Churchill to fetch some
cutlasses from the arms chest, and a moment later he returned with
four, which were handed into the boat. Meanwhile, Morrison had
taken advantage of this opportunity to run below for some
additional provisions for the launch. He and John Millward brought
up a mess kid filled with pieces of salt pork, several calabashes
of water, and some additional bottles of wine and spirits, which
they lowered into the boat.</p>

<p>"You cowards!" Purcell shouted, as the cutlasses were handed in.
"Will you give us nothing but these?"</p>

<p>"Shall we lower the arms chest, carpenter?" Isaac Martin asked,
jeeringly. McCoy threatened him with his musket. "You'll get a
bellyful of lead in a minute," he shouted.</p>

<p>"Bear off and turn one of the swivels on 'em!" someone else
called. "Give 'em a whiff of grape!"</p>

<p>Burkitt now raised his musket and pointed it at Bligh. Alexander
Smith, who was standing beside him, seized the barrel of the musket
and thrust it up. I am convinced that Burkitt meant to shoot Bligh,
but Christian, observing this, ordered him to be dragged back,
deprived of his arms, and placed under guard. He made a terrific
struggle, and it required four men to disarm him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Fryer and others were urging Bligh to cast off lest
they should all be murdered. This Bligh now ordered to be done, and
the launch dropped slowly astern. The oars were gotten out, and the
boat, so low in the water that she seemed on the point of
foundering, was headed toward the island of Tofoa, which bore
northeast, about ten leagues distant. Twelve men made a good load
for the launch. She now carried nineteen, to say nothing of the
food and water and the gear of the men.</p>

<p>"Thank God we were too late to go with her, Byam!"</p>

<p>Morrison was standing beside me.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that?" I asked.</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, as though considering the matter
carefully. Then he said, "No, I don't. I would willingly have taken
my chance in her&mdash;but it's a slim chance indeed. They'll never
see England again."</p>

<p>Tinkler was sitting on a thwart. Mr. Nelson, and Peckover,
Norton, Elphinstone, the master's mate, Ledward, the acting surgeon
all were as good as dead, more than a thousand miles from any port
where they might expect help. About them were islands filled with
the cruelest of savages, who could be held at bay only by men well
armed. Granted that some might escape death at the hands of the
Indians, what chance had so tiny a boat, so appallingly loaded, to
reach any civilized port? The possibility was so remote as to be
not worth considering.</p>

<p>Sick at heart, I turned away from the sight of the frail craft,
looking so small, so helpless, on that great waste of waters. There
had been a cheer from some of the mutineers: "Huzza for Tahiti!" as
Christian had ordered, "Get sail on her!" Ellison, McCoy, and
Williams had run aloft to loose the fore-topgallant sail. Afterward
a silence had fallen over the ship, and the men stood by the
bulwarks, gazing at the launch growing smaller and smaller as we
drew away from her. Christian, too, was watching, standing where I
had last seen him, by the cabin grating. What his thoughts were at
this time it would be impossible to say. His sense of the wrongs he
had suffered at Bligh's hands was so deep and overpowering as to
dominate, I believe, every other feeling. In the course of a long
life I have met no others of his kind. I knew him, I suppose, as
well as anyone could be said to know him, and yet I never felt that
I truly understood the workings of his mind and heart. Men of such
passionate nature, when goaded by injustice into action, lose all
sense of anything save their own misery. They neither know nor
care, until it is too late, what ruin they make of the lives of
others.</p>

<p>It was getting on toward eight o'clock when the launch had been
cast off. Shortly afterward the breeze, from the northeast,
freshened, and the <i>Bounty</i> gathered way quietly, slipping
through the water with a slight hiss of foam. The launch became a
mere speck, seen momentarily as she rose to the swell or as the
sunlight flashed from her oars. Within half an hour she had
vanished as though swallowed up by the sea. Our course was
west-northwest.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c10" id="c10"></a>CHAPTER X.&mdash;FLETCHER
CHRISTIAN</h2>

<p>Our company was divided, and, though linked together by a common
disaster, we were not to share a common fate. I doubt whether a
ship has ever sailed from England whose numbers, during the course
of her voyage, were to be so widely scattered over the face of the
earth, and whose individual members were to meet ends so strange
and, in many cases, so tragic.</p>

<p>There had gone with Bligh, in the launch:</p>

<p>John Fryer, <i>Master</i> Thomas Ledward, <i>Acting Surgeon</i>
David Nelson, <i>Botanist</i> William Peckover, <i>Gunner</i>
William Cole, <i>Boatswain</i> William Elphinstone, <i>Master's
Mate</i> William Purcell, <i>Carpenter</i></p>

<p><i>Midshipmen:</i> Thomas Hayward John Hallet Robert Tinkler</p>

<p><i>Quartermasters:</i> John Norton Peter Lenkletter</p>

<p>George Simpson, <i>Quartermaster's Mate</i> Lawrence Lebogue,
<i>Sailmaker</i> Mr. Samuel, <i>Clerk</i> Robert Lamb,
<i>Butcher</i></p>

<p><i>Cooks:</i> John Smith Thomas Hall</p>

<p>Of those who remained in the <i>Bounty</i>, the following had
taken an active part in the mutiny:</p>

<p>Fletcher Christian, <i>Acting Lieutenant</i> John Mills,
<i>Gunner's Mate</i> Charles Churchill, <i>Master-at-Arms</i>
William Brown, <i>Gardener</i></p>

<p><i>Able Seamen:</i> Thomas Burkitt Matthew Quintal John Sumner
John Millward William McCoy Henry Hillbrandt Alexander Smith John
Williams Thomas Ellison Isaac Martin Richard Skinner Matthew
Thompson</p>

<p>Those in the <i>Bounty</i> with, but not of, Christian's party,
were:</p>

<p><i>Midshipmen:</i> Edward Young George Stewart</p>

<p>James Morrison, <i>Boatswain's Mate</i> Joseph Coleman,
<i>Armourer</i> Charles Norman, <i>Carpenter's Mate</i> Thomas
McIntosh, <i>Carpenter's Crew</i> William Muspratt, <i>Able
Seaman</i></p>

<p>Also Michael Byrne, the half-blind seaman, and myself. William
Muspratt had, for a moment, pretended to be of the mutineers' party
and had accepted a musket offered to him by Churchill. He had
overheard Fryer say that he hoped to form a party to retake the
vessel, and I am certain he had taken the musket for no other
reason than to assist Fryer. When he saw that the matter was
hopeless, he immediately laid aside his arms. Coleman, Norman, and
McIntosh had been prevented from going in the launch because the
mutineers had need of their services as artificers. Smiths and
carpenters can no more be dispensed with on a ship at sea than can
seamen themselves.</p>

<p>It was but natural that those who had taken no part in the
mutiny should be looked upon with suspicion by those who had. Most
of the seamen, however, showed no active hostility against us.
Churchill ordered us to remain on deck, but forward of the
mizzenmast, and there we awaited Christian's pleasure. Burkitt, who
had been deprived of his musket and placed under arms, lest he
should shoot Captain Bligh, was again set at liberty. He and
Thompson now began baiting and jeering at us, and McCoy and John
Williams joined with them. For a moment it seemed likely that there
would be a pitched battle between us, and there is no doubt that
the non-mutineers would have had the worst of it. Fortunately for
us, Christian soon restored order. He came forward, his eyes
blazing with anger.</p>

<p>"Get about your work, Thompson," he ordered. "Burkitt, if I have
any more trouble from you, I'll put you in irons and keep you
there!"</p>

<p>"That's how it is to be, is it?" Thompson replied. "Well, we
won't have it, Mr. Christian. We ain't mutinied to have you come
the Captain Bligh over us!"</p>

<p>"No, by God, we haven't!" Martin added; "and that you'll
find!"</p>

<p>Christian looked at them for a moment without speaking, and
there was that in his eyes to relieve any apprehensions one might
have had as to his ability to cope with the situation. The four
turbulent men dropped their glances sullenly. Several of the seamen
were standing by, Alexander Smith among them. "Order all hands aft,
Smith," said Christian. He returned to the quarter-deck and paced
up and down while the men collected. Then he turned and faced
them.</p>

<p>"There is one matter we will decide once for all," he began,
quietly, "and that is who is to be captain of this ship. I have
taken her with your help, in order to be rid of a tyrant who has
made life a burden to all of us. Make no mistake about our status
from this time on. We are mutineers, and if we should be discovered
and taken by one of His Majesty's vessels, not a man of us but will
suffer death. That possibility is not so remote as some of you may
think. Should Mr. Bligh succeed in reaching England, immediately
upon his arrival there a ship of war will be sent in search of us.
Should the <i>Bounty</i> not be reported in a year's time, or, at
the latest, two years, a ship will be sent, nevertheless, to
discover, if possible, the reason for her disappearance. Bear this
in mind, all of you. We are not only mutineers but pirates as well,
for we have run away with one of His Majesty's armed vessels. We
are cut off from England forever, except as prisoners whose fate,
if taken home, is certain.</p>

<p>"The Pacific is wide, and still so little known that we need
never be taken except as the result of our own folly. In our
situation a leader is essential, one whose will is to be obeyed
without question. It should be needless to tell British seamen that
no ship, whether manned by mutineers or not, can be handled without
discipline. If I am to command the <i>Bounty</i> I mean to be
obeyed. There shall be no injustice here. I shall punish no man
without good cause, but I will have no man question my
authority.</p>

<p>"I am willing that you shall decide who is to command the
<i>Bounty</i>. If there is some man most of you prefer in my place,
name him, and I will resign my authority. If you wish me to lead
you, mind what I have said. I mean to be obeyed."</p>

<p>Churchill was the first to speak. "Well, men, what have you to
say?"</p>

<p>"I'm for Mr. Christian!" Smith called out.</p>

<p>There was an immediate hearty agreement with Smith on the part
of all the mutineers with the exception of Thompson and Martin; but
when Christian called for a show of hands, even these two raised
theirs with the others.</p>

<p>"We have another matter to decide," Christian went on. "There
are a number of men with us who took no part in seizing the vessel.
They would have gone with Mr. Bligh had opportunity
permitted..."</p>

<p>"Put 'em in irons, sir," Mills called out. "They'll do us a
mischief if they can."</p>

<p>"On this ship, there shall be no putting of anyone in irons
without good cause," Christian replied. "These men are not to be
blamed for taking no part with us. They decided as seemed best to
them, and I respect their decisions; but I shall know how to act if
they show toward us any sign of treachery. It is for them to decide
now what their treatment with us shall be."</p>

<p>He then called each of us in turn, beginning with Young, and
asked whether he could count upon our cooperation, as members of
the ship's company, so long as we remained in the <i>Bounty</i>.
Young decided, then and there, to throw in his lot with the
mutineers.</p>

<p>"Chance has decided this matter for me, Mr. Christian," he said.
"I will not say that I would have helped you take the ship had I
been awake at the time of the mutiny, but now that you have taken
her, I am content that it should be so. I have no great desire to
see England again. Wherever you may go you can count on me to go
with you."</p>

<p>Of the neutral party, he was alone in this decision.. The rest
of us promised to obey orders, to assist in every way in working
the ship, and to refrain from all treachery so long as we should
remain aboard of her. Our numbers being what they were, this was
the only thing we could do. Christian neither asked, nor, I think,
expected, that we should not desert if an opportunity presented
itself.</p>

<p>"That is sufficient," he said when he had heard us out. "I
require from you no more than that. But you will understand that I
must protect myself and these men from capture. In doing so I shall
consider our interests before your own. You could not expect me to
do otherwise."</p>

<p>He then appointed his officers. Young was made master, Stewart
the master's mate, myself quartermaster, Morrison boatswain, and
Alexander Smith boatswain's mate. Churchill was master-at-arms, as
before. Burkitt and Hillbrandt were appointed quartermaster's
mates. Millward and Byrne were to be the cooks. We were divided
into three watches.</p>

<p>These matters being decided, we went about our duties. A part of
the great cabin was fitted up as Christian's quarters, and as soon
as they were ready the arms chest was removed there. He used it for
his bed, and kept the keys always on his own person. One of the
mutineers stood on guard, day and night, at the doorway to the
cabin. As for Christian himself, he messed alone, and rarely spoke
to anyone except to give an order. The captain of a vessel lives,
of necessity, a solitary existence, but never could there have been
one more lonely than Fletcher Christian. Despite the bitterness I
felt toward him at this time, my heart softened as I watched him
pacing the quarter-deck hour after hour, by day and by night. All
the gaiety had gone out of him; there was never the hint of a smile
on his face&mdash;only an expression of sombre melancholy.</p>

<p>Stewart, Young, and I messed together, as usual, but our meals
were not the jolly affairs they had so often been in the past. It
was impossible to become accustomed to the emptiness and silence of
the ship. We avoided speaking of those who had gone in the launch,
as one avoids speaking of the recently dead, but we were reminded
of them at every turn; and the thought of their probable fate, and
our own, put a damp upon our spirits hard to overcome. But this
applied to Stewart and me rather than to Young. He seemed to have
few regrets for the turn our fortunes had taken; indeed, he looked
forward with pleasure, rather than otherwise, to the prospect of
spending the remainder of his life on some island in the South
Sea.</p>

<p>"We may as well make the best of it, lads," he said one evening
when we were discussing the future. "It's far from a bad best, if
you look at the matter sensibly. I've always wanted a life of ease.
Ever since reading Captain Wallis's and Captain Cook's accounts of
their discoveries in the Pacific, I've dreamed of nothing but
tropical islands. When the chance came to ship with the
<i>Bounty</i> I was the happiest man in England. I'm willing to
confess now that, had it been possible, I would have deserted the
ship at Tahiti."</p>

<p>"We shall never see Tahiti again, that is certain," said
Stewart, gloomily. "It will be the last place Mr. Christian will
consider as a refuge. He knows only too well that a ship of war
will turn up there, sooner or later, in search of us."</p>

<p>"What does it matter?" asked Young. "There are scores, hundreds
of other islands where we can live as happily. I advise the pair of
you to put all thoughts of home out of your minds. The chances of
your ever seeing England again are very remote. Make the most of
what life offers you here."</p>

<p>Remote indeed they seemed then. After parting with the launch we
had followed the course the ship was then on, west-northwest, until
well into the afternoon; then we bore off to the eastward, since
which time our general course had been east by south. We were now
in unknown seas, in so far as I knew, off the track of any ship
that had explored the Pacific. It was clear that Christian was in
search of undiscovered islands, for we hove-to at night lest we
should pass any in the darkness. Those days and nights were as
peaceful as any that I remember. The absence of Bligh was a godsend
to all of us, mutineers and non-mutineers alike. There was no more
of the continual feeling of tension, of uncertainty as to what
would happen, whenever the captain appeared upon deck. Christian
maintained the strictest discipline, but no one had cause to
complain of his justice. He was a born leader of men, and knew how
to rule them without the perpetual floggings and abuse which Bligh
considered so essential. After the turbulent events of the mutiny,
the men seemed glad of the tranquillity which had settled over the
ship. The breeze blew steadily from the northeast, and the
<i>Bounty</i> nosed her way quietly along as though she had
mastered the task of sailing herself and required no further help
from us. The moon waxed and was on the wane when, one morning
shortly after sunrise, land was descried bearing west by north.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon we approached to within a mile of the reef
which seemed to enclose the island, forming a shallow lagoon where
we saw many canoes plying back and forth. The island appeared to be
about eight miles long. The interior was mountainous like that of
Tahiti, although the land was not so high, and the lowlands
surrounding it were covered with the same luxuriance of vegetation.
As in most of the islands in that part of the Pacific, deep water
came directly up to the reef, and we coasted along, close inshore.
Several canoes, with ten or a dozen men in each, put off from the
beach and soon came up with us. The Indians resembled the Tahitians
in colour, stature, and the manner of their dress, and it was
evident that they had never seen a European vessel before. We tried
to persuade them to come alongside, and at last one of them paddled
abreast of us at a distance of about thirty yards.</p>

<p>The men were strongly made, with handsome features and
well-formed bodies. At Christian's order I spoke to them in the
Tahitian language, asking them the name of their land. This they
understood, and replied that it was Rarotonga. They seemed utterly
astonished at my words. One of them replied at some length, but his
speech was largely unintelligible. For all our friendly gestures we
could not persuade them to approach more closely. Some trinkets
Christian wished to give them were wrapped in a cloth and lowered
over the side on a piece of planking. When we had let this drift
well astern, they approached and took the parcel and the plank as
well, which they put into their canoe without unwrapping the cloth
to see what it contained.</p>

<p>Having failed in our efforts to persuade any of them to come on
board, Christian gave orders to make sail, much to the regret of
all of us, for this island was scarcely less beautiful than Tahiti,
and, judging by the actions of the men in the canoes, the people
would not have opposed our landing. It has always remained a puzzle
to me why Christian did not choose this island as his hiding-place;
for Rarotonga lies nearly seven hundred miles southwest of Tahiti,
and at this time he had no reason to believe that its existence was
known to any Europeans save ourselves. His reason may have been
that, in coasting the entire length of one side of the island, no
possible anchorage was to be seen; or perhaps, at this time, he was
so disturbed in mind as to have no definite plans for the
future.</p>

<p>One evening, greatly to my surprise, he sent for me to sup with
him. The afterpart of the great cabin had been partitioned off for
his use, and there I found him, seated at his table, with a copy of
one of Captain Cook's charts outspread before him. He greeted me
with formal politeness, but when he had dismissed the sentinel
stationed outside and had closed the door, he fell back into the
old friendly manner customary between us before the mutiny.</p>

<p>"I have asked you to sup with me, Byam," he said, "but you need
not accept unless you choose."</p>

<p>I responded, against my inclination, to his friendly overtures.
I had come to resent bitterly the ruin he had brought upon us all;
but under the influence of his appealing kindly manner I found my
indignation melting away. I stood before Fletcher Christian, my
friend, not the mutineer who had cast nineteen men adrift in a
small boat thousands of miles from home. To those who blame me I
can merely say that they never knew the man.</p>

<p>He was in great need of someone to whom he could unburden his
thoughts, and I had not been five minutes in his cabin before he
was speaking of the mutiny.</p>

<p>"When I think of Bligh," he said, "I have no regrets. None
whatever. I have suffered too much at his hands ever to care what
his fate may be. But for those who went with him..."</p>

<p>He shut his eyes tightly and pressed his knuckles against them,
as though to blot from his mind the picture of the small open boat,
filled, almost to the point of foundering, with innocent men. Such
desolation of heart was apparent in his voice and the expression on
his face that I pitied him deeply. I knew that he would never know
peace again&mdash;never until his last day. He begged me to profit
by his example and never act upon impulse, and for all my sympathy
I could not avoid saying that a mutiny so carefully and secretly
planned could hardly be called an act of impulse.</p>

<p>"Good God!" he exclaimed. "Did you think it was planned? Ten
minutes before Bligh was seized I had no more thought of mutiny
than you yourself. Had it been an act of deliberation...Is it
possible that you could have believed it?"</p>

<p>"What else could I think?" I replied. "It happened in your
watch. When I was awakened by Churchill I found you in complete
possession of the ship, with armed men stationed at the hatchways
and all about the decks. It is inconceivable to me that all this
could have happened without prearrangement."</p>

<p>"And yet it did," Christian replied, earnestly. "It was all the
work of five minutes. Let me tell you...Do you remember the talk we
had the night before, during Peckover's watch?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly."</p>

<p>"I asked that, in case anything happened to me during the voyage
home, you would explain the circumstances to my people when you
reached England. My reason for speaking of this matter was that I
planned to leave the ship before the morning watch. I had taken no
one into my confidence except the quartermaster, John Norton, a man
whom I knew I could trust. I was not willing that you should know.
I wanted to spare your feelings until I had gone, and it was
certain that you would have tried to dissuade me. Norton had
managed to make, secretly, a tiny raft upon which I hoped to reach
the island of Tofoa. With the sea as calm as it was, I had every
reason to think that I could make the land."</p>

<p>"You really meant to cut yourself off for all time from home and
friends?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I was in hell, Byam! I had suffered from Bligh's tyranny
to the limit of my endurance. When he accused me, that same
afternoon, with stealing his coconuts, I felt that I could bear no
more."</p>

<p>"I know," I said; "you were sorely tried, but we were all in the
same sorry situation with you."</p>

<p>"I didn't think of that. I thought only of the shame of the
accusation; of the contemptible, sordid meanness of the man who
could bring such a charge against his officers. I thought as well
of the long voyage ahead of us, and I knew that I could not and
would not endure another year of such torment.</p>

<p>"But luck was against me. The calmness and beauty of the night,
so favourable otherwise to my purpose, were against me. As you
know, most of the ship's company were on deck and, almost becalmed
as we were, it would have been impossible to slip away unseen. At
last I decided that the plan would have to be abandoned,
temporarily at least. I should have to wait until we passed some
other island farther to the westward.</p>

<p>"Even at four o'clock, when I took charge of the deck from
Peck-over, the thought of mutiny had not occurred to me. Believe
this; I assure you that it is true. I paced up and down for some
time, brooding over the repeated insults I had received from Bligh.
I don't defend myself; I merely relate the facts. I was in a mood
to kill the man. Yes, that thought crossed my mind more than once:
why not murder him and be done with it? The temptation was all but
overpowering. This will give you an indication of the state of my
feelings at that time. I was, in sober truth, out of my mind.</p>

<p>"As you know, Hayward was the mate of my watch. In order to
regain control of myself I went in search of him, and found him
stretched out in the lee of the cutter, asleep. At another time
such neglect of duty would have aroused my anger. We were in
unknown waters, and Bligh had rightly given orders that the
strictest watch should be kept, no matter how far we might be from
land. Hayward was in charge of the forward deck, and three of the
men, taking their cue from him, were asleep. I stood for a moment
looking down at Hayward, and then, as plainly as though they had
been spoken, I heard the words, 'Seize the ship.'</p>

<p>"From that moment my brain worked with the utmost clearness and
precision. It appeared to function outside of me; I had only to
obey its commands. I realized what an opportunity had presented
itself, but not at all the wrong I should be doing the rest of you.
Burkitt was awake, standing in the waist by the bulwarks on the
larboard side. He had been frequently punished by Bligh and I knew
that I could count on his help, but I didn't reveal my plan
then&mdash;for I now had a plan. I asked him to come below with me
and waken Churchill, Martin, Thompson, and Quintal, without
disturbing anyone else, and to tell them I wanted to see them at
the fore ladderway. Meanwhile I went to Coleman's hammock, roused
him quietly, and asked for the key to the arms chest, saying that I
wanted a musket to shoot a shark. He gave it to me, turned over in
his hammock, and fell asleep again.</p>

<p>"I found Hallet asleep on the arms chest. As he was also of my
watch, I roused him with a show of anger and set him on deck by the
after ladderway. He was badly frightened at being caught, and
begged me in a low voice to say nothing of the matter to Captain
Bligh. Burkitt and the men he had awakened were awaiting me. They
fell in at once with my plan. We provided ourselves with muskets
and pistols, and I placed Thompson sentinel over the arms chest. We
then roused McCoy, Williams, Alexander Smith, and others, every man
of them promising his hearty support. They were given arms, and
when I had placed sentinels at the hatchways we went to Bligh's
cabin. The rest you know."</p>

<p>He fell silent and sat for some time with his head in his hands,
staring at the deck between his feet. At length I forced myself to
say, "What chance do you think Bligh has of reaching England?"</p>

<p>"Little enough. Timor is the nearest place where they could
expect help. It is twelve hundred leagues from the place where the
launch was cast adrift...When I seized the ship my only thought was
that I would carry Bligh home in irons. The men wouldn't have it;
you saw that for yourself. I was forced to give way on that point.
Then came the question of who was to go with him. My plan was, at
first, to send only Fryer, Samuel, Hallet, and Hayward, but I could
not refuse to let any others go with him who wished to; in fact,
not to have done so would have been highly dangerous. Fryer,
Purcell, Cole, and Peckover would, I knew, make every effort to
form a party for retaking the ship, if kept with us...Well, enough
of this. What is done can't be undone. I now have to think of the
men who are with me. The least I can do is to prevent them from
being taken."</p>

<p>"And what of the rest of us?"</p>

<p>"I have been expecting that question. You have every right to
ask it. I can't hope that any of you will give up all thoughts and
hope of home and throw in your lot with us as Young has done. My
predicament is only less hard than the one I have brought you
into." He rose and stood by one of the stern ports, looking out to
westward, where the sun had just set. Presently he turned to me
again. "If I should take you to Tahiti and allow you to part
company from us, none of you would feel bound to keep silence about
the mutiny. For the present, much as I regret it, I must keep you
with us. I can say no more. You must be content with that."</p>

<p>Of his immediate plans Christian said nothing, although he gave
me to understand that we should be making land within a few days.
On the morning of May 28, precisely four weeks after the mutiny, an
island was seen dead to windward, distant about six leagues. We
spent most of that day in beating up to it, and were becalmed
toward nightfall about three miles off the western end. At dawn,
when the trade wind made up again, we coasted along the barrier
reef which lay a great way offshore, in places as far as two miles.
Stewart, who had a perfect memory for latitudes and longitudes and
for any chart he had seen, was convinced that this island was
Tupuai, which had been discovered by Captain Cook. After nearly two
months at sea, the place seemed a Garden of Eden to all of us and,
mutineers and nonmutineers alike, we were eager to go ashore. There
were various small islands scattered along the reef, and between
them, across the lagoons, we had entrancing glimpses of the main
island. All along the coast we saw evidences of a numerous
population.</p>

<p>Christian now informed us that there was a pass through the reef
into the lagoon, and that he meant to take the ship inside; but
when we came abreast of the entrance we found a formidable array of
Indians awaiting us. The entire male population of the island must
have gathered there. We estimated their numbers at eight or nine
hundred. All were armed with spears, clubs, and canoe loads of
stones for repelling our entrance. There was no doubt of the
hostility of their intentions; they would have none of our friendly
overtures, but brandished their spears and sent such showers of
stones on our decks from their slings that several of our men were
hurt. We were forced to draw off the land, and from the masthead it
was clear that the passage into the lagoon and the lagoon itself
was scattered with coral shoals which would make navigation of the
ship difficult, even granted that we were unmolested by the
Indians. With them in opposition all hope of a landing had to be
abandoned. Some of the mutineers were for turning the guns on the
Indians, and had we done so we could have killed hundreds of them
and brought the remainder under subjection; but Christian would
have none of this plan. He was resolved that, wherever we went, we
would make a peaceful settlement or none at all.</p>

<p>He now called a conference on the quarter-deck of the men of his
own party, and the rest of us, with the exception of Young, were
sent forward, out of hearing. At the end of a quarter of an hour
the men dispersed to their duties, and it was plain that some
decision had been reached pleasing to all of them. The ship was
headed north.</p>

<p>Young was bound to say nothing of what had taken place at the
meeting, and we refrained from asking him embarrassing questions.
But, knowing our position, we also knew that north, if that course
were to be held for several days, could mean only one thing: our
destination was Tahiti. Morrison, Stewart, and I talked in whispers
in the berth that evening. We scarcely dared hope for such good
fortune as a return to Tahiti. There, if anywhere, we stood some
chance of meeting any vessel that might be sent out to search for
the <i>Bounty</i>. We might have to wait for several years, but a
vessel was certain to come at last. We resolved that, if the
<i>Bounty</i> called there, we would never come away in her. We
would escape, somehow, and conceal ourselves until the ship had put
to sea again.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c11" id="c11"></a>CHAPTER XI.&mdash;THE LAST OF THE
<i>BOUNTY</i></h2>

<p>On the day following our decision to escape, should the ship put
in at Tahiti, Christian sent for me once more. I found him with
Churchill in his cabin, and when he had motioned me to the settee
he dismissed the sentinel and closed the door. Christian looked
stern, sad, and careworn, but Churchill, who stood by the door with
folded arms, greeted me with a smile. He was a tall, powerful
fellow, in middle life, with cold blue eyes and a determined
reckless face.</p>

<p>"I have sent for you, Mr. Byam," said Christian formally, "to
acquaint you with our decision regarding you and your companions
who had no hand in the taking of the ship. We bear you no ill will,
yet circumstances oblige us to take every precaution for our own
safety. We are now steering for Tahiti, where we shall stop for a
week or more while we load livestock and stores."</p>

<p>My face must have betrayed my thoughts, for Christian shook his
head. "My first thought," he went on, "was to leave you there,
where sooner or later you might hope for a ship to take you home.
But the men would have none of it, and I fear that they are
right."</p>

<p>He glanced at Churchill, who nodded, still standing with folded
arms. "No, Mr. Byam," said the master-at-arms, "we had it out in
the forecastle last night&mdash;a regular Dover-court. Not a man on
the ship but wishes you well, but we can't allow it."</p>

<p>"They are right," said Christian gloomily; "we can neither leave
you on Tahiti nor let you set foot on shore. The men were for
keeping the lot of you below decks, under guard, but I persuaded
them that if you and Mr. Stewart and Mr. Morrison would give parole
not to mention the mutiny to the Indians, nor to say anything which
might prejudice our interests, we might safely permit you to come
on deck while we are at anchor in Matavai."</p>

<p>"I think I understand, sir," I replied, "though I must admit
that we had hoped to be left in Tahiti, whither we supposed the
ship to be bound."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" Christian said. "I hate to carry you away against
your will, but it is essential to the safety of your shipmates.
None of us will ever see England again&mdash;we must make up our
minds to that. You may tell the others that it is my intention to
search out one of the many unknown islands in this sea, land our
stores and livestock, destroy the ship, and settle there for good,
hoping never again to see a strange white face."</p>

<p>"Aye, Mr. Christian," put in Churchill approvingly. "It is the
only way."</p>

<p>Christian stood up, to notify me that the interview was at an
end, and I went on deck with a sinking heart. With the fresh east
wind abeam, the <i>Bounty</i> was sailing fast on the starboard
tack, rolling slowly and regularly to the lift of the swell. I
stood by the lee gangway, watching the blue water swirl past the
ship's side, and striving to collect my thoughts. Stewart and I had
often discussed in privacy our hopes and fears for the future, and
now, unless we found means to escape during the ship's sojourn in
Matavai, our hopes seemed destined to come to naught. It was true
that the parole demanded of us, if we were to be allowed on deck,
contained no mention of escape, but I had no doubt that we should
be closely watched. And even if we were lucky enough to escape, I
realized that the chances were a hundred to one we should be
retaken. Christian would have invented some plausible tale to
account for the absence of Bligh and the others, and, as captain of
the ship, the chiefs would be on his side. For the reward of a
musket or two, they would have the mountains and valleys of the
interior scoured by men certain to find us, no matter how distant
and secret our hiding-place. Our only chance&mdash;a slender one,
indeed&mdash;would be to get possession of a fast sailing canoe and
make for the islands to leeward of Tahiti, whither the authority of
Teina and the other great chiefs of north Tahiti did not extend.
Once there, even though Christian learned our destination and gave
pursuit, we might be able to dodge from island to island till he
wearied of the chase.</p>

<p>To leave the ship under the eyes of the mutineers would be hard
indeed; to set sail at once, in a fast and seaworthy canoe, watered
and provisioned for a voyage across the open sea, would be harder
still. Yet hardest of all was the thought of the alternative:
"England&mdash;home, lost to us forever."</p>

<p>As I stood by the gangway, deep in these disquieting
reflections, Stewart touched my arm. "Look," he said; "they are
throwing the plants overboard!" Directed by Young, a line of men
had formed on the ladderway, and they were beginning to pass the
pots from hand to hand. A man by the rail, aft, pulled up each
young plant by the roots and flung it overboard, while others
emptied the earth into the sea and carried the pots to the
forehatch. We carried more than a thousand young breadfruit trees,
all in flourishing condition, and now the <i>Bounty</i> left a wake
of their rich green foliage tossing on the blue swell. They had
been gathered and cared for with infinite pains; to obtain them we
had suffered hardships, braved unknown seas, and sailed more than
twenty-seven thousand miles, in fair weather and foul. And now the
plants, eagerly awaited in the West Indies, were going overboard
like so much unwanted ballast.</p>

<p>"Waste!" remarked Stewart presently. "Futility and waste! And,
like a good Scot, I hate both!"</p>

<p>It was sad to reflect on the results of the expedition: the
plants thrown overboard; Bligh and his companions probably drowned
or killed by savages; the mutineers, desperate and unhappy,
planning to hide away forever from the face of mankind; ourselves
forced to share the same hard fate.</p>

<p>Later, in the privacy of the berth, I told Stewart of my
interview with Christian and of the gloomy prospect ahead of us.
"We must tell Morrison as soon as possible," he said.</p>

<p>He was silent for some time, his thin, bronzed face
expressionless. At last he looked up. "At least I'll see
Peggy."</p>

<p>"That's certain, if you give your parole."</p>

<p>"I'd give that, and more, for a glimpse of her!" He rose
abruptly and began to pace back and forth nervously. I said
nothing, and presently he went on in a low voice: "Forgive me for
inflicting my thoughts on you&mdash;seamen are sentimental, and I
have been long at sea. But Peggy might be the means of effecting
our escape&mdash;I can think of no other."</p>

<p>"That she might!" I exclaimed, for I had given the subject much
anxious thought. "She could obtain a canoe for us&mdash;a favour we
could ask of no other person in Matavai. Since we must give our
parole we cannot make known the true state of affairs, nor why we
desire to leave the ship. You will have to tell Peggy that we are
planning to desert, as Churchill and the others deserted, in order
to live among the Indians after the ship is gone. The chiefs alone
own vessels large enough to take us to the Leeward Islands, and
both Teina and Hitihiti feel themselves too much indebted to the
friendship of King George to take part in what they would regard as
a conspiracy against him. Peggy's father is under no such
obligation."</p>

<p>Stewart seated himself once more. His mind was quicker than my
own, and he had perceived in an instant what had taken me some time
to puzzle out.</p>

<p>"Precisely," he said. "Peggy is our only chance. I could arrange
everything in ten minutes alone with her. It must be on a night
when the wind holds from the east. The canoe will be paddled past
the ship as if outbound on one of their night passages to Tetiaroa,
and her crew must make some disturbance which will draw the men of
the watch to that side of the <i>Bounty</i>. We can then slip
overboard on the other side and swim to Peggy's vessel, which will
lie hove-to while they get sail on her. With good luck, no one will
observe us in the dark."</p>

<p>"By God, Stewart! I believe it can be done!"</p>

<p>"Must be done, rather! Morrison and I are Navy men, and we have
our careers to think of. But there have been many times when I have
longed to stay here."</p>

<p>On the evening of the fifth of June we raised the highlands of
Tahiti, far ahead and ghostly among the clouds, and on the
following afternoon we sailed into Matavai Bay and dropped anchor
close to Point Venus. Every man on board had been instructed what
to tell the Indians of his acquaintance who might make inquiries:
at Aitutaki we had fallen in with Captain Cook, Bligh's father, who
was forming an English settlement on that island. Bligh, Nelson,
and others of the <i>Bounty's</i> crew had been taken aboard Cook's
ship, and he had ordered the <i>Bounty</i> to leave the breadfruit
plants with him, and return to Tahiti to trade for further stores
and whatever livestock it might be possible to obtain. The ship was
then to set sail in search of another island suitable for
settlement.</p>

<p>The Indians flocked out to the ship&mdash;Teina, Hitihiti, and
the other chiefs curious to know why we had returned so soon and
what had become of the absent members of the ship's company. The
story invented by Christian satisfied them completely, and since he
was popular&mdash;much more so than Bligh&mdash;the natives
promised to furnish everything we desired, and the trading was
friendly and brisk.</p>

<p>I dined with Christian that evening; his sweetheart and old
Hitihiti, my <i>taio</i>, were the other guests. With the
girl&mdash;who would eat nothing&mdash;at his side, Christian
seemed to have shaken off for the moment the sombre mood from which
he had not emerged since the mutiny. He raised his glass and smiled
at me across the table.</p>

<p>"To our sweethearts," he said lightly. "You can drink to mine,
Byam, since you have none of your own." Maimiti smiled gravely and
touched the glass with her lips, but my <i>taio</i> drained his
wine at a gulp.</p>

<p>"Stop ashore my house, Byam," he said.</p>

<p>I could feel Christian's eyes on me as I replied. "I'm sorry," I
said; "but we shall be here only a few days, and Mr. Christian has
informed me that I shall be needed on board."</p>

<p>Hitihiti was evidently surprised at this. He turned to
Christian, who nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "He will be needed on board during the whole
time we are at anchor here." The old chief understood enough of
discipline on a British ship to let the subject drop.</p>

<p>Peggy had come on board during the afternoon, and when I went on
deck after dinner I saw the couple seated by the mainmast, in the
shadow of the pumps. Stewart's arm was about her waist and they
were speaking together in the Indian tongue. When she had gone
ashore, Stewart, Morrison, and I met by agreement on the main
hatch. Young was the officer of the watch, and since we were at
anchor and the night was calm, he had given his men permission to
sleep on deck. He was a carefree, unsuspicious fellow, and now he
lolled on the poop, his head turned toward the dark loom of the
land. Taurua, his Indian sweetheart, kept the watch with
him&mdash;a slender ghostly figure, shrouded in white tapa. The
night was chilly, for it was winter in Tahiti, and Matavai Bay was
a black mirror to reflect the stars.</p>

<p>"I have talked with Peggy," said Stewart in a low voice, "and
explained our determination to desert the ship. She thinks that I
am leaving for her sake&mdash;a half-truth, at least. As for you
two, she believes that you are enamoured of the Indian life, or of
some of the young ladies on shore. Peggy will aid us with her whole
heart. Unfortunately, the only large canoe her family possesses is
at Tetiaroa. She will send a small vessel to fetch it to-morrow if
the wind is fair."</p>

<p>"Then let us pray for a fair wind," said Morrison seriously.</p>

<p>"I wish we could take the others," I said.</p>

<p>"There will be no chance of that," Morrison replied. "Christian
means to keep them confined below till the ship sails."</p>

<p>"In any case there would be too many," said Stewart. "Their very
numbers would make escape impossible."</p>

<p>Morrison shrugged his shoulders. "No&mdash;we can think only of
ourselves. I have only one desire, one thought&mdash;to return to
England. A ship will come, you may count on that, though we may
have to wait two or three years for her. We shall have to be
patient, that is all."</p>

<p>"Patient?" Stewart remarked. "Well, I could put up with three
years here&mdash;or with four or five! And Byam is a lover of the
Indian life."</p>

<p>"Damn the Indian life," said Morrison without a smile. "Who
knows what wars are going on, what chances for prize-money and
promotion we are missing!"</p>

<p>I went to sleep with a light heart that night, for our escape
seemed a certainty, and the prospect of a year or two among the
Indians was far from displeasing. At dawn I saw Peggy's light
double canoe, paddled by half-a-dozen stalwart fellows, set out for
Tetiaroa, and all through the forenoon I watched every sign of the
weather anxiously. Nature herself now took a hand against us. The
day turned chilly and films of cloud began to stream seaward off
the mountains. We were in the lee of the high land, and Matavai Bay
remained still as a lake, but the wind had chopped around to the
south and was blowing up one of the boisterous southerly storms the
Indians call <i>maraai</i>. Gazing out to sea, I perceived the line
of whitecaps at the end of the lee, and knew that as long as the
south wind held, no canoe would even attempt to return from the
island north of us.</p>

<p>Day after day the strong south wind blew, while we traded for
our strange cargo. Hogs, fowls, dogs, and cats came on board till
the ship resembled a menagerie, and finally the bull and the cow
left on Tahiti by Captain Cook. Goats skipped about comically on
deck, among mounds of taro, sweet potatoes, and yams. And little by
little our hope, which had run so high, began to change to fear.
There were signs that Christian was nearly ready to sail, and
Peggy's face, when she visited her lover on board, grew haggard
with anxiety. I shall not dwell on our suspense. It is enough to
say that on the ninth day the wind shifted to northeast and brought
our sailing canoe in, four hours after the shift. This was at noon
and all was arranged for our escape the same night, but now at the
last moment fate turned against us once more. At two o'clock in the
afternoon Christian ordered the anchor up and, close-hauled on the
starboard tack, the <i>Bounty</i> sailed out of Matavai Bay.</p>

<p>The months from June to September of that year, 1789, are a
nightmare in my memory, and since they have little to do with the
main thread of this narrative, I shall give them no more space than
they deserve.</p>

<p>In spite of our hostile reception when we first visited Tupuai,
Christian had determined to settle on that island. We were now
southbound, like modern Noahs on our Ark, with livestock of various
kinds to increase and multiply on the island, and even a few Indian
Eves to become the grandmothers of a new race&mdash;half white,
half brown. Christian's Maimiti was on board, and Young's Taurua;
and Alexander Smith, distrustful of the ladies of Tupuai, had
persuaded Bal'hadi to accompany him. Nor was any great degree of
persuasion necessary, for the Indians were passionately fond of
travel and adventure of any sort. Long after Tahiti had disappeared
below the horizon north of us, it was discovered that we had on
board nine Indian men, twelve women, and eight boys, most of them
stowaways.</p>

<p>Our reception on Tupuai was at first friendly, owing to the
Tahitian passengers, who explained our desire to settle on the
island. With incredible labour we hauled the ship up on land and
built thatched shelters to protect her decks from the sun. We then
built a fort, on a point of land purchased from one of the chiefs,
and surrounded it with a moat twenty feet deep and twice as wide,
all hands, including Christian himself, taking part in the work.
The men murmured much at this truly Herculean labour, but
Christian's foresight was soon evident. Our goats, loosed to
increase among the mountains of the interior, descended on the taro
gardens of the Indians, which they cultivate and water with
infinite pains. Unable to capture or kill the wary animals, the
people came to us, asking us to shoot them with our muskets. When
we refused, explaining that the progeny of the marauders would
provide an important supply of food, the Indians at first murmured
and then broke out in open hostility, declaring that they would
never cease their efforts until we were either exterminated or
driven from the island for good. Time after time they attacked our
fortress furiously, only to be driven off by the fire of our
four-pounders and swivels, and before long it became impossible to
venture outside save in strong parties, heavily armed. Our lives
grew insupportable; even the hardiest among us wearied of the
constant fighting, and early in September, perceiving that all
hands were heartily sick of the place, Christian assembled the lot
of us and called for a show of hands. All were for leaving Tupuai;
sixteen expressed a desire to be left on Tahiti, and the rest
wished to sail away with the <i>Bounty</i> to search for some
uninhabited island where they might settle in peace. On being
informed of our decision to leave Tupuai, the Indians agreed to
cease hostilities while we launched and watered the ship, and after
a week of labour such as falls to the lot of few men, we got the
<i>Bounty</i> launched, her sails bent, and water and stores
aboard. At the last moment, on the verge of leaving this ill-omened
place, we nearly lost the ship in a tremendous squall which made up
unperceived during the night. As it was, we lost the spare gaff of
the driver and all our spare topgallant yards.</p>

<p>At daybreak, with a fresh breeze at east, we weighed and sailed
out through the narrow passage, heartily glad to be clear of a
place where we had met with nothing but misfortune and strife, and
five days later, after an agreeable voyage, we were at anchor once
more in Matavai Bay. The following men had decided to remain on the
ship:&mdash;Fletcher Christian, Acting Lieutenant; John Mills,
Gunner's Mate; Edward Young, Midshipman; William Brown, Gardener;
Isaac Martin, William McCoy, John Williams, Matthew Quintal, and
Alexander Smith, Able Seamen.</p>

<p>The rest of the <i>Bounty's</i> company had elected to remain on
Tahiti. I was overjoyed at this sudden change in my fortunes, as
were Stewart and Morrison. My old friend Hitihiti was among the
first of the Indians to come off to us, and when I informed him
that I hoped to go ashore and make my home at his house, his face
beamed with smiles. As he had come out in a double canoe large
enough to freight all my belongings ashore, I lost no time in
asking Christian's permission to leave the ship. I found him at the
main hatch, superintending the division of the muskets, cutlasses,
pistols, and ammunition, of which each man was to have his
share.</p>

<p>"By all means," he said, looking up from the paper in his hand.
"Go ashore whenever you like. And take a musket with you and a
supply of lead to mould bullets. We are so short of powder that I
can give only a few charges to each man. You will stop with
Hitihiti, of course?"</p>

<p>"That is my intention, sir."</p>

<p>"I shall see you to-night, then. I wish to speak to you and to
Stewart&mdash;I shall ask him to be there an hour after
sundown."</p>

<p>My hammock man and his lusty Indian wench lent me a hand to get
my things out of the berth, and after a farewell glance about the
<i>Bounty's</i> decks, and a silent handshake with Edward Young, I
followed my belongings into Hitihiti's canoe.</p>

<p>It was like a homecoming to return once more to the house of my
<i>taio</i>, to greet Hina and her husband, and to see Hitihiti's
grandchildren running to welcome me. I had lived so long among
these kind people that they seemed joined to me by ties closer than
those of mere friendship.</p>

<p>When I had stowed my belongings and precious manuscript I became
at once the centre of a circle of all ages, eager to hear the story
of our adventures. I recounted at length, in the Indian tongue, the
history of our attempt to settle on Tupuai, and ended by expressing
some sympathy with the people of that island, who, after all, had
done no more than repel what they considered an invasion of their
home. Hina shook her head indignantly.</p>

<p>"No!" she exclaimed; "you are wrong. I have seen some of those
people, who came here in a large canoe five years ago. They are
savages! You should have killed them all and taken their
island!"</p>

<p>"You are fierce, Hina," I said with a smile. "Why should we kill
innocent men, whose only fault was love of their land? Had we
desired to kill them, Christian would not have allowed it."</p>

<p>"He was foolish, then. Did they not try to kill him, and you?
But what will you do, now that you have returned? Shall you be long
among us?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow or the day after, Christian and eight of the others
will set sail for Aitutaki to rejoin Captain Cook. The rest of us,
who love your island, have permission to settle here."</p>

<p>All of us who were to be left on Tahiti had given our words to
tell the same story, and, little as I liked the task, I lied with a
brazen face. Hina leaned towards me and seized me in a strong
embrace, smelling at my cheek affectionately.</p>

<p>"Ah, Byam," she said, "we are delighted, all of us! The house
has been empty since you sailed away!"</p>

<p>"Aye," said her husband heartily. "You are one of us, and we
shall not let you go!"</p>

<p>Early in the evening Stewart appeared on the path from Matavai,
accompanied by Peggy and her father, olti Tipau. Hitihiti had
returned to the ship, to fetch Christian and his niece. I walked
down to the beach with Stewart and his sweetheart, leaving the old
chief to gossip with the others in the house.</p>

<p>The calm Pacific nuzzled lazily at the sands, and we sat
quietly, as if the beauty of the evening had cast upon us a spell
of silence and immobility.</p>

<p>Twilight was fading to night when Stewart started slightly and
gazed out to sea. "There they come!" he said. Rising and falling on
the gentle swell outside the reef, I saw the double canoe&mdash;a
moving shadow on the waters. She came on rapidly, and before long
her prows grounded on the sand and Christian sprang out, turning to
help Maimiti over the high gunwale. He nodded to us, saying only,
"Wait for me here," and followed Hitihiti to the house to take
leave of his sweetheart's family. At a word from Stewart, Peggy
followed him.</p>

<p>The sight of Christian on the twilit beach had moved me deeply.
It was not hard to imagine his feelings on the eve of this final
departure from Tahiti. Presently I heard a rustle in the bushes
behind us, and his step falling softly on the sand. We rose, but he
motioned us to seat ourselves, and sank down cross-legged beside
us, casting aside his hat and running his fingers through his thick
dark hair.</p>

<p>"This is the last time I shall see you," he said abruptly, after
a long silence. "We shall sail in the morning, as soon as the wind
makes up.</p>

<p>"I have told you the story of the mutiny," he went on; "remember
that I, and I alone, am responsible. In all probability, Bligh and
those with him are long since dead&mdash;drowned or killed by
savages. In the case of Bligh, I have no regrets; the thought of
the others, innocent men, lies heavy on my conscience. You know the
circumstances; they may explain, even to some extent excuse, the
action I took, but they can never exonerate me. I am a mutineer
and, since I made off with one of His Majesty's ships, a pirate as
well. It is my duty to guide and protect those who have chosen to
follow me. You know my plans. This is the greatest ocean in the
world, set with innumerable islands. On one of them&mdash;north, or
south, or east, or west of here&mdash;we shall settle, and destroy
the ship. You shall see us no more&mdash;I promise you that."</p>

<p>Again silence fell upon us. The stillness of the night was
broken only by the faint lap and wash of the sea, and far down the
beach, where a fire of coconut husks made a ruddy point of light, I
heard the wail of an awakening child.</p>

<p>"Sooner or later," Christian went on, after a long pause, "a
British man-of-war will drop anchor here. If Bligh, or any of his
men, succeed in reaching England, the Admiralty will dispatch a
ship at once, to apprehend the mutineers. If, as I fear, all those
in the <i>Bounty's</i> launch are lost, a vessel will be sent out,
after a reasonable period of waiting, in search of us. When she
comes, I desire you earnestly to go out to her at once and give
yourselves up to the officer in command&mdash;you two, and the
others who had no hand in the mutiny. You are innocent, and no harm
can come to you. As for the others, let them behave as they think
best. Since they refuse to follow me, I am forced to wash my hands
of them.</p>

<p>"Once before, Byam, in a moment of desperation, I requested you
to communicate with my father, in the event of my not reaching
home. Fate was against me that night! Had I succeeded in leaving
the ship...My father is Charles Christian, of Mairlandclere, in
Cumberland. Will one of you, the first to reach England, go to him
and explain the circumstances of the mutiny? Tell him the story as
I have told it to you, and explain particularly that my design was
only to relieve Bligh of his command and take him home in irons. A
full acquaintance with the truth may extenuate in my father's eyes,
though never justify, the crime I have committed. Will you do this
for me?"</p>

<p>Christian stood up and Stewart and I sprang to our feet. I was
the first to seize Christian's hand.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, too moved for further speech.</p>

<p>A moment later Christian turned to hail the house. "Maimiti!" he
called, in his strong seaman's voice. She must have been awaiting
the call, for she appeared almost instantly, a slender white figure
flitting under the palms. The paddlers followed her, seized the
canoe, and dragged it into the wash of the sea. The Indian girl
came to me without a word and embraced me tenderly in the fashion
of her people. Still in silence she embraced Stewart, and sprang
into the canoe. Christian shook our hands for the last time. "God
bless you both!" he said.</p>

<p>We stood on the beach, watching the double canoe fade into the
night. At dawn, when I walked out of the house for a plunge in the
sea, the <i>Bounty</i> was standing offshore with all sail set,
heading north, with the light easterly breeze abeam.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c12" id="c12"></a>CHAPTER XII.&mdash;TEHANI</h2>

<p>Though I had reason to congratulate myself on my present
situation, the week following the <i>Bounty's</i> departure was an
unhappy time for me. For the first time in my life, I think, I
began to question the doctrines of the Church in which I had been
brought up, and to ask myself whether human destiny was ordered by
divine law or ruled by chance. If God were all-powerful and good, I
thought, with a lad's simplicity, why had He permitted one man, in
a moment of not unrighteous anger against oppression and injustice,
to ruin his own life and the lives of so many others? Many a good
and innocent man had accompanied Bligh in the launch: where were
they now? The majority of the mutineers themselves were simple
fellows with a grievance that might have led better men to revolt.
Held in subjection by the iron law of the sea, they had endured
with little complaint the hardships of the long voyage and the
temper of a man considered brutal in a brutal age. Had Bligh not
goaded his junior officer beyond endurance, no other man on the
ship would have raised the cry of mutiny, and the voyage would have
been completed peacefully. But one moment of passion had changed
everything. Out of the whole ship's company, only seven of
us&mdash;those who had had no hand in the mutiny and were now
awaiting the first English ship&mdash;had come out of the affair
scot-free. And our fate could scarcely be termed
enviable&mdash;marooned for an indefinite time among Indians, on an
island at the very ends of the earth. As for the mutineers who had
chosen to remain on Tahiti, I knew only too well what their fate
was likely to be. Young Ellison, who had been our mess boy, was
often in my thoughts at this time. He had no realization of the
gravity of the part he had played. Yet I knew that unless he
quitted Tahiti before the arrival of a British man-of-war, our sea
law would infallibly condemn him to death.</p>

<p>During those days of doubt and depression at Hitihiti's house,
when Hina strove to divert my thoughts and my good old <i>taio</i>
tried fruitlessly to cheer me up, I ceased to be a boy and became a
man. Morrison was settled with Poino, the famous warrior who lived
not far off, and Stewart was living with Peggy, in the house of
Tipau, at the foot of One Tree Hill. I went frequently to pass the
time of day with these two friends, and from their example learned
to be ashamed of my fruitless depression. Morrison and Millward,
who lived with Stewart at Poino's house, were already planning the
little schooner they eventually built, and in which, without
awaiting the arrival of a ship from home, they hoped to sail to
Batavia, whence they might get passage to England. Stewart, who
loved gardening, worked daily at beautifying the grounds about the
new house old Tipau was building for him. When I mentioned my
thoughts to him, he only smiled and said: "Never worry about what
you cannot change," and went on with his digging, and planting, and
laying out of paths. Perceiving at last that hard work was the
remedy for my greensickness, I set to once more on my dictionary
and was soon absorbed in the task.</p>

<p>One morning, about ten days after the departure of the
<i>Bounty</i>, I found myself unable to sleep and set out for a
walk on the long curving beach that led to Point Venus. It was
still an hour before dawn, but the stars were bright and the
northerly breeze blowing from the region of the equator made the
air warm and mild. A dog barked at me as I passed an encampment of
fishermen asleep on the sands under blankets of bark cloth. Their
great net, hung on stakes to dry, stretched for a quarter of a mile
along my path. At the very tip of the point, sheltered by the reef
and provided with a deep, safe entrance, lies one of the most
beautiful little harbours on the island, resorted to by travelers
in sailing canoes who wish to pass the night on shore. The water is
always calm and beautifully clear, and a good-sized vessel can be
moored so close in shore that a man may leap from her stern to the
beach.</p>

<p>The point was a favourite resort of mine at this hour, for the
view up the coast at sunrise was one I loved. I was pleased to find
the cove deserted, and, settling myself comfortably on one of the
high sand dunes, I gazed eastward, where the first faint flush of
dawn was beginning to appear. At that moment a slight sound caught
my ear, and, glancing seaward, I perceived that a large sailing
canoe was stealing in through the passage. Her great brown sails of
matting were ghostly blots on the sea, and presently I could hear
the low commands of the man at the masthead, conning her in. She
came on fast under her press of sail, rounded-to smartly inside,
and dropped her stone anchor with a resounding plunge. The sails
were furled while paddlers brought her stern to the land, and a man
sprang ashore to make fast her stern-line to a coconut stump.</p>

<p>From the size of the vessel and the number of her crew, I judged
that she carried passengers of consequence, but whoever they were,
they still slept under the little thatched awning aft. Several of
the crew came on land to build a fire of coconut husks and prepare
food for the morning meal, and I saw two women helped ashore, who
strolled away westward along the point and disappeared.</p>

<p>It was full daylight, with the rim of the sun just above the
horizon, when I rose, unperceived by the travelers, and walked
across to the large river which emptied into the sea on the west
side of the point. It was called Vaipoopoo, and close to the mouth
there was a long reach of deep clear water in which I loved to
swim&mdash;a quiet and beautiful spot, distant from the habitations
of the Indians. The water was a good twenty yards across and so
deep that a boat of twelve tons burthen might have entered to a
distance of a quarter of a mile. Tall old mape trees arched
overhead, their buttressed roots forming many a rustic seat along
the banks.</p>

<p>I had long since chosen such a seat for myself, high above the
still water and at a distance of about a cable's length from the
beach. Frequently in the late afternoon I spent an hour or two
alone at this place, listening to the rustling of the trees high
overhead, and watching the small speckled fresh-water fish as they
rose for their evening meal of flies. In my fancy I had named this
spot Withycombe, after our home in England, for indeed there were
moments when the place seemed English to the core, when I fancied
myself in the warm summer twilight at home, watching the trout rise
in one of our West Country streams.</p>

<p>To Withycombe, then, I repaired for my morning bath. I threw off
the light mantle of Indian cloth from my shoulders and girded up
the kilt about my waist. Next moment I slipped into the deep clear
water and swam leisurely downstream, drifting with the gentle flow
of the current. High in a tree overhead a bird was singing&mdash;an
<i>omaomao</i>, whose song is sweeter than that of our English
nightingale.</p>

<p>As I drifted downstream I perceived suddenly, seated among the
buttressed roots of an old tree, a young girl lovely as a
water-sprite. I must have made some slight splashing sound, for she
turned her head with a little start and gazed full into my eyes. I
recognized her at once&mdash;she was Tehani, whom I had seen in
Tetiaroa long before. She gave no sign of shyness or embarrassment,
for a girl of her position had in those days nothing to fear by day
or by night, alone or in company. A rude word to her would have
been the cause of instant death to the offender; an act of violence
to her person might easily have brought on a devastating war. This
sense of security imparted to the girls of Tehani's class an
innocent assurance of manner which was by no means the least of
their charms.</p>

<p>"May you live!" I said, Indian-fashion, rounding-to against the
current.</p>

<p>"And you!" replied Tehani, with a smile. "I know who you are!
You are Byam, the <i>taio</i> of Hitihiti!"</p>

<p>"True," said I, eager to prolong the conversation. "Shall I tell
you who you are? You are Tehani, Poino's relative! I saw you in
Tetiaroa, when you danced there."</p>

<p>She laughed aloud at this. "Ah, you saw me? Did I dance
well?"</p>

<p>"So beautifully that I have never forgotten that night!"</p>

<p>"<i>Arero mona</i>!" she exclaimed mockingly, for the Indians
call a flatterer "sweet tongue."</p>

<p>"So beautifully," I went on as if I had not heard, "that I said
to Hitihiti: 'Who is yonder girl, lovelier than any girl in Tahiti,
who might be the young goddess of the dance herself?"</p>

<p>"<i>Arero mona</i>!" she mocked again, but I could see the blush
mantling her smooth cheeks. She had just come out of the river and
her brown hair lay in damp ringlets on her shoulders.
"Come&mdash;let us see which can swim further under water, you or
I!" Tehani slipped into the stream, and dived so smoothly that she
scarcely rippled the still water. Clinging to the great root which
had been her seat, I watched for what seemed an interminable time.
The river turned in a bend about fifty yards below me, and at last,
from out of sight beyond the bend, I heard Tehani's voice. "Come,"
she called gaily. "It is your turn to try!"</p>

<p>I dove at the words and began to swim downstream, about a fathom
deep. The water was clear as air and I could see the shoals of
small bright fish scatter before me and seek refuge among the
shadowy boulders below. On and on I went, determined that no girl
should excel me in the water, an element I have always loved. Aided
by the current, my progress was swift, and finally, when my lungs
would endure no more and I felt satisfied that I had won, I came to
the surface with a gasp. A chuckle musical as the murmur of the
stream greeted me, and shaking the water from my eyes I saw the
girl seated on a long root, flush with the water, a full ten yards
beyond.</p>

<p>"You came up there?" I asked in some chagrin.</p>

<p>"I have not cheated."</p>

<p>"Let us rest for a little while, and then I shall try
again."</p>

<p>Tehani patted the root beside her. "Come and rest here," she
said.</p>

<p><a name="id06" id="id06"></a>I pulled myself up beside her,
shaking the wet hair back from my eyes. Moved by common impulse,
our two heads turned, and Tehani's clear brown eyes smiled into
mine. She turned away suddenly and all at once I felt my heart
beating fast. Her hand was close to mine on the rough gnarled root;
I took it gently, and since it was not withdrawn I locked my
fingers in hers. She bent her head to gaze into the clear water and
for a long time neither of us spoke.</p>

<p>I gazed, not at the water, but at the beautiful girl at my side.
She wore only a light kilt of white cloth, and her bare shoulder
and arm, turned to me, were smooth as satin and of the most
exquisite proportions. Her feet and hands, small and delicately
made, might have been envied by a princess, and Phidias himself
could have produced in cold marble nothing one half so lovely as
her young breasts, bared in all innocence. In her face I saw
sweetness and strength.</p>

<p>"Tehani!" I said, and took her hand in both of mine.</p>

<p>She made no answer, but raised her head slowly and turned to me.
Then all at once, and without a word between us, she was in my
arms. The faint perfume of her hair intoxicated me, and for a time
the beating of my heart made speech impossible. It was the girl who
spoke first.</p>

<p>"Byam," she asked, stroking my wet hair caressingly, "have you
no wife?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied.</p>

<p>"I have no husband," said the girl.</p>

<p>At that moment I heard a woman's voice calling from downstream:
"Tehani! Tehani O!" The girl hailed back, bidding the caller to
wait, and turned to me.</p>

<p>"It is only my servant who came ashore with me. I bade her wait
at the mouth of the stream while I bathed."</p>

<p>"You came from Tetiaroa?" I asked, with her head on my shoulder
and my arm about her waist.</p>

<p>"No, I have been to Raiatea with my uncle. We have been two days
and two nights at sea."</p>

<p>"Who is your uncle?"</p>

<p>The girl turned to me in real astonishment. "You do not know?"
she said incredulously.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Yet you speak our tongue like one of us! Strange men, you
English&mdash;I have never talked with one of you before. My uncle
is Vehiatua, of course, high chief of Taiarapu."</p>

<p>"I have often heard of him."</p>

<p>"Are you a chief in your own land?"</p>

<p>"A very small one, perhaps."</p>

<p>"I knew it! Knew it the moment I laid eyes on you! Hitihiti
would not take as his <i>taio</i> a common man."</p>

<p>Again we fell silent, both conscious that our words reflected
only the surface of our minds. "Tehani!" I said.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She raised her head and I kissed her in the English fashion,
full on the lips. We walked back to the cove hand in hand, while
the servant followed us, her eyes round with wonder.</p>

<p>Vehiatua had come ashore and was at breakfast when we came to
the cove. He was a nobly proportioned old man, with thick gray hair
and a manner of cheerful, good-natured dignity. His retainers were
grouped about him as he ate, serving him with breadfruit, grilled
fish fresh from the coals, and bananas from a great bunch they had
brought ashore. The old chief's tattooing, which covered every
portion of his body save his face, was the most beautiful and
intricate I have ever seen. I was glad that I wore only my kilt,
for it is discourteous to approach the great Indian chiefs with
covered shoulders. Vehiatua gave no sign of surprise at sight of
me.</p>

<p>"Eh, Tehani," he called out affectionately to his niece. "Your
breakfast is ready for you on board. And who is the young man with
you?"</p>

<p>"The <i>taio</i> of Hitihiti&mdash;Byam is his name."</p>

<p>"I have heard of him." And then, turning to me courteously,
Vehiatua asked me to join him at his meal. I sat down beside him,
nothing loth, and answered this questions regarding Hitihiti and
the <i>Bounty</i>, of which he had heard much. He expressed
surprise at my knowledge of the Indian tongue, and I told him of my
mission and how my <i>taio</i> had aided me.</p>

<p>"And now you and the others are settling on Tahiti to remain
among us?" Vehiatua asked.</p>

<p>"For a long time, at any rate," I replied. "It is possible that
when the next British ship arrives, in two years or three, King
George may send word that one or all of us must go home."</p>

<p>"Aye," said the old aristocrat, "one must obey one's king!"</p>

<p>Presently Tehani came ashore, her breakfast over and her toilet
made, very different from the young tomboy who had beaten me at
diving so short a time before. Her beautiful hair, dried in the
sun, combed out and perfumed, was dressed in the Grecian fashion,
low on the nape of her neck. Her mantle of snow-white cloth was
draped in classic folds, and she walked ahead of her little band of
women with an air of dignity few English girls of sixteen could
have assumed. The chief gave me a nod and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Let us go to the house of my kinsman," he said.</p>

<p>A stout muscular fellow crouched before Vehiatua, hands braced
on his knees. The chief vaulted to his shoulders with the ease of
long practice, and the human horse stood upright with a grunt.
Vehiatua, Teina, and two or three other great chiefs of those days
were never permitted to walk, for the touch of their feet rendered
a commoner's land theirs. Wherever they went, save in their own
domains, they were borne on the backs of men trained to the
task.</p>

<p>With Tehani at my side, I followed her uncle down the beach,
walking on the hard moist sand at the water's edge. As we passed
the encampment of fishermen they hastened to throw off the mantles
from their shoulders and seat themselves on the sand. To remain
standing while a high chief passed would have been the greatest of
insults.</p>

<p>"<i>Maeva te arii</i>!" was their greeting. (Hail to the
chief!)</p>

<p>"May you live," said Vehiatua affably; "and may your fishing
prosper!"</p>

<p>Old Hitihiti met us before his door, throwing off his mantle and
stepping forward with bare shoulders to greet his friend. A meal
was being prepared, and though our visitor had just eaten a
prodigious quantity of food, he expressed his willingness to share
in a second breakfast. Tehani and Hina knew each other well and
seemed to have much to talk over. From the glances Hina cast at me
from time to time, I suspected that Tehani was telling her of our
meeting in the stream.</p>

<p>Toward noon, when the others had sought out shady places in
which to spread their mats for a nap, I found my <i>taio</i> awake.
He was alone, under his favourite hibiscus tree close to the beach,
and I told him of my meeting with the girl, and that I loved her
too dearly for my peace of mind.</p>

<p>"Why not marry her, if she is willing?" asked Hitihiti, when I
had done.</p>

<p>"I think she might be willing, but what would her parents
say?"</p>

<p>"She has none; both are dead."</p>

<p>"Vehiatua then."</p>

<p>"He likes you."</p>

<p>"Very well. But suppose we were married, and an English ship
came with orders that I must go home."</p>

<p>My <i>taio</i> shrugged his great shoulders in despair. "You
English are all alike," he said impatiently; "you make yourselves
miserable by thinking of what may never happen! Is not to-day
enough, that you must think of to-morrow and the day after that?
The thought of an English ship makes you hesitate to marry the girl
you fancy! And ten years, or twenty, might pass before another ship
arrives! Enough of such talk! Yesterday is gone; you have to-day;
to-morrow may never come!"</p>

<p>I could not help smiling at my old friend's philosophic
outburst, not without its grain of sound common sense&mdash;called
"common" because it is so rare. Worry over the future is without
doubt the white man's greatest strength and greatest weakness in
his quest of happiness&mdash;the only conceivable object in life.
To the people of Tahiti, worry over the future was unknown; their
language indeed contained no word with which to express such an
idea.</p>

<p>No doubt Hitihiti was right, I reflected; since I was destined
to live a long time among the Indians, I was justified in adopting
their point of view. "You are my <i>taio</i>," I said. "Will you
intercede for me with Vehiatua? Tell him that I love his niece
dearly, and desire to marry her?"</p>

<p>The old chief clapped me on the back. "With all my heart!" he
exclaimed. "You have been too long without a wife! Now let me
sleep."</p>

<p>Tehani was awake before the others had finished their siesta,
and I found her strolling on the beach. We were alone, and she came
to me swiftly. "Sweetheart," I said, "I have spoken to my
<i>taio</i>, and he has promised to ask Vehiatua for your hand. I
have not done wrong?"</p>

<p>"I spoke to my uncle before he lay down to sleep," Tehani
replied, smiling. "I told him I wanted you for my husband and must
have you. He asked if you were willing, and I said that I must have
you, willing or not! 'Do you want me to make war on Hitihiti and
kidnap his friend?' he asked. 'Yes,' said I, 'if it comes to that!'
He looked at me affectionately and then said: 'Have I ever denied
you anything, my little pigeon, since your mother died? This Byam
of yours is English, but he is a man nevertheless, and no man could
resist you!' Tell me, do you think that is true?"</p>

<p>"I am sure of it!" I answered, pressing her hand.</p>

<p>When we returned to the house the sun was low, and the two
chiefs, who had dismissed their followers, were conversing
earnestly. "Here they are!" said Vehiatua, as we came in hand in
hand.</p>

<p>"And well content with one another," remarked my <i>taio</i>
smilingly.</p>

<p>"Vehiatua gives his consent to the marriage," he went on to me.
"But he makes one condition&mdash;you are to spend most of your
time in Tautira. He cannot bear to be separated from his niece. You
will sympathize with him, Byam, and I too can understand. But you
must come often to visit old Hitihiti, you two!"</p>

<p>"You are to be married at once, Tehani says, and in my house,"
said the chief of Taiarapu. "You can sail with me to-morrow, and
Hitihiti and Hina will follow in their single canoe. They will
represent your family at the temple. You two may consider
yourselves betrothed."</p>

<p>I rose at these words and went into the house to open my box.
When I returned, I carried the bracelet and the necklace purchased
in London so long before. I showed them first to Vehiatua, who
turned them admiringly in his hands.</p>

<p>"My gift to Tehani," I explained. "With your permission."</p>

<p>"She should be happy, for no girl in these islands possesses
such things. I have seen gold, and know that it is very precious
and does not rust like iron. A royal gift, Byam! What may we give
you in return?"</p>

<p>"This!" I said, clasping the necklace about Tehani's neck, and
taking her by the shoulders as if I would carry her off.</p>

<p>Vehiatua chuckled approvingly. "Well answered!" he said. "A
royal gift in truth. For three and seventy generations she can
count her ancestors back to the gods! Look at her! Where in all
these islands will you find her like?"</p>

<p>Early the next morning, Vehiatua's men carried my belongings to
the cove, and presently we went on board and the paddlers drove the
vessel out through the passage, in the morning calm. She was the
finest of all the Indian ships I had seen&mdash;her twin hulls each
well over a hundred feet long, and twelve feet deep in the holds.
Her two masts, well stayed and fitted with ratlines up which the
sailors could run, spread huge sails of matting, edged with light
frames of wood. On the platform between the two hulls was the small
house in which the chief and his women slept, and it was here,
sheltered from the rays of the sun, that I was invited to recline
during our forty-mile voyage.</p>

<p>We paddled westward, skirting the long reefs of Pare, till the
wind made up, and then, spreading our sails, we raced down the
channel between Tahiti and Eimeo, with a fresh breeze at
north-northeast. Toward noon, when we were off the point of Maraa,
the wind died away and presently made up strong from the southeast,
so that we were obliged to make a long board out to sea. I
perceived at this time that the large Indian canoes, like
Vehiatua's, could outpoint and outfoot any European vessel of their
day. With the wind abeam they would have left our best frigates
hull-down in no time, and, close-hauled, they would lay incredibly
close to the wind.</p>

<p>The sea was rough off shore, and nearly all of the women on
board were sick, but I was delighted to observe that Tehani was as
good a sailor as I. She was <i>tapatai</i>, as the Indians
said&mdash;fearless of wind and sea. As we approached the southern
coast of Tahiti Nui, she pointed out to me the principal landmarks
on shore, and on Taiarapu, beyond the low isthmus toward which we
were steering. The southeast wind fell away an hour before sunset,
as we were entering a wide passage through the reefs. The sails
were furled and, with a score of paddlers on each side, we rowed
into a magnificent landlocked bay, where the fleets of all the
nations of Europe might have cast anchor, secure from any storm.
This bay is on the south side of the Isthmus of Taravao, and is one
of the finest and most beautiful harbours in the world.</p>

<p>The isthmus was uninhabited and overgrown with jungle, for the
Indians believed it to be the haunt of evil spirits and unfit to be
inhabited by men. We slept on board Vehiatua's vessel that night,
and next morning&mdash;since the passage around the southeast
extremity of Taiarapu was judged dangerous, owing to the violent
currents and sunken reefs extending far out to sea&mdash;our vessel
was dragged on rollers across the isthmus, a distance of about a
mile and a half, by a great company of people from the near-by
district of Vairao, summoned for the purpose. The principal chiefs
and landowners of Tahiti, on their voyages around the island,
always have their canoes dragged across this low land, and in the
course of centuries a deep smooth path has been worn in the soil.
The Vairao people performed their task with remarkable order and
cheerfulness, and in less than three hours' time our vessel was
launched on the north side. At Pueu we entered a passage through
the reef and traveled the rest of the distance in the smooth
sheltered water close along shore. It was mid-afternoon when we
reached Tautira, where Vehiatua resided most of the time.</p>

<p>The chief was received ceremoniously by the members of his
household, by the priest of the temple, who offered up a long
prayer of thanks that Vehiatua had been preserved from the dangers
of the sea, and by a vast throng of his subjects, to whom his
justice and good nature had endeared him.</p>

<p>A meal had been prepared, for news of our coming had preceded
us, and when Vehiatua, Taomi, the old priest, Tuahu, Tehani's elder
brother, and I sat down to eat on the great semicircular verandah
of the house, I caught my breath at the magnificence of the
prospect. The house, shaded by old breadfruit trees, stood on high
land, close to the deep clear river of Vaitepiha. To the east, the
blue plain of the Pacific stretched away to the horizon; to the
north and west, across ten miles of calm sea, Tahiti Nui swept up
in all its grandeur to the central peaks; and to the west I gazed
into the heart of the great valley of Vaitepiha, where cascades
hung from cliffs smothered in vegetation of the richest green, and
ridges like knife-blades ran up to peaks like turrets and spires.
No man in the world, perhaps, save Vehiatua, possessed a house
commanding such a view.</p>

<p>Hitihiti and his daughter arrived next day, and the ceremonies
of my marriage with Tehani began on the day following. Vehiatua's
first act was to present me with a fine new house, on the beach,
about a cable's length distant from his own. It had been built for
the under chief of the district, a famous warrior. This
good-natured personage moved out cheerfully when informed that
Vehiatua desired the house for his son-in-law&mdash;for so he was
kind enough to consider me.</p>

<p>Into my new house I moved at once, with Hitihiti, his daughter,
her husband, and the people of their household who had accompanied
them from Matavai. Early in the morning my party and I set out for
Vehiatua's house, carrying with us numerous gifts. These were
termed the o&mdash;which is to say, with truly extraordinary
brevity, "insurance of welcome." When these presents had been
formally received, both families joined in a slow and stately
parade to my house, while servants in the rear brought the bride's
gifts&mdash;livestock, cloth, mats, furniture, and other things
which would be useful to the new household. A throng of Vehiatua's
subjects lined the path, and a band of strolling players caused
constant laughter with their antics and songs.</p>

<p>In the house, Hina, who represented the female side of my
"family," spread a large new mat, and on it a sheet of new white
cloth. Vehiatua was a widower, and his older sister, a thin,
white-haired old lady, straight and active as a girl, acted for his
clan. Her name was Tetuanui, and she now spread upon Hina's cloth,
half overlapping it, a snow-white sheet of her own. This symbolized
the union of the two families, and Tehani and I were at once
ordered to seat ourselves on the cloth, side by side. To the right
and left of us were arrayed a great quantity of gifts&mdash;mats,
capes, and wreaths of bright featherwork. We were then enjoined to
accept these gifts in formal phrases, and when we had done so Hina
and Tetuanui called for their <i>paoniho</i>. Every Indian woman
was provided with one of these barbarous little implements&mdash;a
short stick of polished wood, set with a shark's tooth keen as any
razor. They were used to gash the head, causing the blood to flow
down copiously over the face, on occasions of mourning and of
rejoicing. While the spectators gazed at them in admiration, the
two ladies now did us the honour of cutting their heads till they
bled in a manner which made me long to protest. Taomi, the priest,
took them by the hands and led them around and around us, so that
the blood dripped and mingled on the sheet on which we sat. We were
then directed to rise, and the sheet, stained with the mingled
blood of the two families, was carefully folded up and
preserved.</p>

<p>Vehiatua had dispatched to the mountains, the night before, a
brace of his <i>piimato</i>, or climbers of cliffs. The office of
these men was hereditary, and every chief kept one or two of them
to fetch the skulls of his ancestors when required for some
religious ceremony, and to return them afterwards to the secret
caves, high up on the cliffs, where they were kept secure from
desecration by hostile hands. The <i>piimato</i> carried in each
hand a short pointed stick of ironwood, and with the aid of these
they climbed up and down vertical walls of rock to which a lizard
could scarcely cling. The skulls of Vehiatua's ancestors were to be
witnesses of the religious ceremony presently to take place.</p>

<p>When the ceremony of the bride's reception in my house was over,
we paraded slowly back to the house of Vehiatua, and went through a
precisely similar ceremony there, even to the bloodletting and the
folded sheets. This marked my reception into the house of Tehani's
family. We next sat down to a feast, the men apart from the women,
which lasted till mid-afternoon.</p>

<p>The social part of the marriage was now over; the religious
remained. It was performed in Vehiatua's family <i>marae</i>, or
temple, on the point not far from his house. Old Taomi, the priest,
led the solemn procession. The temple was a walled enclosure,
shaded by huge banyan trees and paved with flat stones. Along one
side a pyramid thirty yards long and twenty wide rose in four steps
to a height of about forty feet, and on top of it I perceived the
effigy of a bird, curiously carved in wood. Accompanied by Hitihiti
and his daughter, I was led to one corner of the enclosure, while
Tehani, with Vehiatua and other relatives, took her place opposite
me. The old priest then approached me solemnly and asked:</p>

<p>"You desire to take this woman for your wife; will not your
affection for her cool?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied.</p>

<p>Taomi next walked slowly across to where my young bride awaited
him, and put the same question to her, and when she answered, "No,"
he made a sign to the others, who advanced from their respective
corners of the <i>marae</i> and unfolded the two sheets of white
cloth, on which the blood of the two families was mingled. Other
priests now came forward, bearing very reverently the skulls of
Vehiatua's ancestors, some of them so old that they seemed ready to
crumble at a touch. These silent witnesses to the ceremony were
placed carefully in a line on the pavement, so that their sightless
eyes might behold the marriage of their remote descendant.</p>

<p>The girl and I were told to seat ourselves on the bloodstained
sheets of cloth, hand in hand, while our relatives grouped
themselves on either side. The priest then called upon the mighty
chiefs and warriors whose skulls stood before us, giving each man
his full name and resounding titles, and calling upon him to
witness and to bless the union of Tehani with the white man from
beyond the sea. When this was done, old Taomi turned to me.</p>

<p>"This woman will soon be your wife," he said seriously.
"Remember that she is a woman, and weak. A commoner may strike his
wife in anger, but not a chief. Be kind to her, be considerate of
her." He paused, gazing down at me, and then addressed Tehani:
"This man will soon be your husband. Bridle your tongue in anger;
be patient; be thoughtful of his welfare. If he falls ill, care for
him; if he is wounded in battle, heal his wounds. Love is the food
of marriage; let not yours starve." He paused again and concluded,
addressing us both: "<i>E maitai is mai te mea ra e e na reira
orua</i>!" This set phrase might be translated: "It will be well,
if thus it be with you two!"</p>

<p>The solemnity of old Taomi's words and manner impressed the girl
beside me so deeply that her hand trembled in mine, and, turning my
head, I saw that there were tears in her eyes. In the dead silence
following his words of admonition, the priest began a long prayer
to Taaroa, the god of the Vehiatua clan, beseeching him to bless
our union and to keep us in bonds of mutual affection. At last he
finished, paused, and then called suddenly: "Bring the
<i>tapoi!</i>"</p>

<p>A neophyte came running from the rear of the temple, carrying a
great sheet of the sacred brown cloth made by men. The priest
seized it, spread it wide, and flung it over us, covering Tehani
and me completely. Next moment it was flung aside and we were told
to rise. The marriage was over, and we were now embraced in the
Indian fashion by the members of both clans. Of the days of
feasting and merrymaking that followed our wedding there is no need
to speak.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c13" id="c13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;THE MOON OF
PIPIRI</h2>

<p>It means little to say that I was happy with Tehani. It may mean
more to state that only two women have left their mark on my
life&mdash;my mother and the Indian girl. Long before the birth of
our daughter I had resigned myself to the prospect of a life of
tranquil happiness in Tautira; the sense of my immense remoteness
from England grew stronger with the passage of time, and the hope
that a ship might come faded into the background of my thoughts.
Had it not been for my mother, who alone seemed to lend reality to
memories of England, I am by no means certain that the arrival of a
ship would have been welcome to me. And since I felt assured that
neither Bligh nor any of those with him in the launch would ever
reach home, I knew that my mother would be in no distress on my
account until it became evident that the <i>Bounty</i> was long
overdue. Adopting old Hitihiti's tropical philosophy, I put the
past and the future out of mind, and for eighteen months&mdash;the
happiest period of my entire life&mdash;I enjoyed each day to the
full.</p>

<p>With her marriage, Tehani seemed to take on a new dignity and
seriousness, though in the privacy of our home she showed at times
that she was still the same wild tomboy who had beaten me at
swimming in Matavai. I was working on my dictionary every day, and
Sir Joseph Banks himself could not have entered into these labours
with greater enthusiasm than did my wife. She directed our
household with a firmness and skill that surprised me in so young a
girl, leaving me free to do my writing and to divert myself with
fishing parties, or with hunting wild boars in the hills. But I
preferred excursions in which Tehani could accompany me, and missed
many a boar hunt in order to take my wife on short voyages in our
sailing canoe.</p>

<p>About a month after our marriage, Tehani and I sailed down to
Matavai for a visit to my <i>taio</i>. I was eager to see old
Hitihiti, as well as Stewart, Morrison, and other friends among the
<i>Bounty's</i> people settled there. The distance is about fifty
miles, and with the strong trade wind abaft the beam we made the
passage in less than five hours, arriving early in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>"Your friends are building a ship," Hitihiti informed me as we
dined. "Morrison and Millward, the man with him at the house of
Poino, are directing the task, and several others are helping. They
have laid the keel and made fast the stem and stern. They are
working on the point, not far from the sea."</p>

<p>Toward evening we strolled across to the little
shipyard&mdash;Hina, her father, Tehani, and I. Morrison had chosen
a glade about a hundred yards from the beach, an open grassy spot
shaded by tall breadfruit trees. A crowd of Indians sat about on
the grass, watching the white men at work. Their interest was
intense, and in return for the privilege of being spectators they
kept the shipbuilders more than supplied with food. The great chief
Teina, to whom the land belonged, was there, with his wife Itea.
They greeted us affably, and at that moment Morrison glanced up and
caught my eye. He laid down his adze, wiped the sweat from his
eyes, and took my hand heartily.</p>

<p>"We have heard of your marriage," he said. "Let me wish you
happiness."</p>

<p>I made him known to Tehani, and as he pressed her hand young Tom
Ellison came up to me. "What do you think of our ship, Mr. Byam?"
he asked. "She's only thirty feet long, but Mr. Morrison hopes to
sail her to Batavia. We've christened her already:
<i>Resolution</i> is to be her name. By God, it takes resolution to
build a ship without nails, or proper tools, or sawn-out
plank!"</p>

<p>I shook hands with old Coleman, the <i>Bounty's</i> armourer,
and with the German cooper, Hillbrandt. Norman and McIntosh, the
carpenter's mates, were there, and Dick Skinner, the hairdresser
who had been flogged in Adventure Bay. All worked with a will,
under Morrison's direction; some impelled by a desire to reach
England, others, conscious of their guilt, by the fear that a
British ship might take them before their little vessel could set
sail.</p>

<p>At sunset the shipwrights laid down their tools, and, leaving
Tehani to return to the house with Hina and my <i>taio</i>, I
accompanied Morrison to his residence at the foot of One Tree Hill.
He and Millward lived with the warrior Poino, their friend, a
stone's throw from Stewart's house.</p>

<p>I found Stewart pottering about his garden in the dusk. He had
made Tipau's wild glen a place of ordered beauty, with paths
leading this way and that, bordered with flowering shrubs, and
shaded rockeries where he had planted many kinds of ferns. He made
me welcome, straightening his back and shaking the earth from his
hands.</p>

<p>"Byam, you'll stop to sup, of course? And you too,
Morrison?"</p>

<p>Ellison passed us at that moment on his way over the hill, for
he lived in Pare, a mile to the west. Stewart liked the lad and
called out to him: "I say, Tom! Won't you stop the night? It will
be like old times."</p>

<p>"With all my heart, Mr. Stewart!" he said, grinning. "I'm half
afraid to go home, anyhow."</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" asked Morrison.</p>

<p>"That wench of mine again. Last night she caught me giving her
sister a kiss. I swear there was no harm intended, but do you think
she would listen to reason? She knocked her sister down with a tapa
mallet, and would have done the same for me if I had not run for
it."</p>

<p>Stewart laughed. "I've no doubt you deserved it."</p>

<p>Peggy was calling us into the house, and half an hour later we
sat down to our evening meal, served by old Tipau's slaves.
Stewart's dining room was a large thatched house open to the air,
and decorated with hanging baskets of ferns. A man stood at one
end, holding aloft a torch which illuminated the place with a
flickering glare. Peggy had gone off to sup with her women, and
Tipau preferred to eat his meal alone.</p>

<p>"How long will it take you to complete your vessel?" I asked
Morrison.</p>

<p>"Six months or more. The work goes slowly with so few
tools."</p>

<p>"You hope to reach Batavia in her?"</p>

<p>"Yes. From there we can get passage home on a Dutch ship. Five
of us are to make the attempt&mdash;Norman, McIntosh, Muspratt,
Byrne, and I. Stewart and Coleman prefer to wait here for an
English ship."</p>

<p>"I feel the same," I remarked. "I am happy in Tautira, and glad
of the chance to work on my Indian dictionary."</p>

<p>"As for me," said Stewart, "I find Tahiti a pleasant place
enough. And I have no desire to be drowned!"</p>

<p>"Drowned be damned!" exclaimed Morrison impatiently. "Our little
schooner will be staunch enough to sail around the world!"</p>

<p>"You haven't told Mr. Byam about <i>us</i>," put in Ellison. "We
are going to start a little kingdom of our own. Desperate
characters we are&mdash;not one but would swing at the yardarm if
taken by a British ship! Mr. Morrison has promised to set us down
on some island west of here."</p>

<p>"It is the best thing they can do," said Morrison. "I shall try
to find an island where the people are friendly. Tom is coming, as
are Millward, Burkitt, Hillbrandt, and Sumner. Churchill intends to
stay here, though he's certain to be taken and hanged. Dick Skinner
believes it his duty to give himself up and suffer for his crime.
As for Thompson, he is more of a beast than a man, and I would not
have him on board."</p>

<p>"Where is Burkitt?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He and Muspratt are living in Papara," said Stewart, "with the
chief of the Teva clan."</p>

<p>"They offered to join us in the work," Morrison added, "but
neither man has any skill."</p>

<p>I was glad to have news of the <i>Bounty's</i> people, most of
whom I liked. We talked late into the night, while Tipau's man lit
torch after torch from the bundle at his side. The moon was rising
when I took leave of my friends and trudged home along the deserted
beach.</p>

<p>I had occasion, the next morning, to recall what Morrison had
said of Thompson, the most stupid and brutal of the <i>Bounty's</i>
crew. He and Churchill had struck up an oddly assorted friendship,
and spent most of their time sailing about the island in a small
canoe, fitted with a sail of canvas. Thompson disliked the Indians
as much as he distrusted them, and on shore was never without a
loaded musket in his hand.</p>

<p>Going down to the beach for an early bath in the sea, I found
the pair encamped by their canoe, with a sucking pig roasting on
the coals near by. "Come&mdash;join us at breakfast, Mr. Byam,"
called Churchill, hospitably.</p>

<p>Thompson looked up, scowling. "Damn you, Churchill," he
growled&mdash;"Let him find his own grub. We've no more than enough
for ourselves."</p>

<p>Churchill flushed. "Hold your tongue, Matt," he exclaimed, "Mr.
Byam's my friend! Go and learn manners from the Indians, before I
knock them into your head!"</p>

<p>Thompson rose and stalked off to a sandhill, where he seated
himself sulkily, his musket between his knees. I had already
breakfasted, and as I turned away I saw a dozen men pulling a large
sailing canoe up on the beach, and the owner and his wife
approaching us. The man carried in his arms a child of three or
four years. They stopped by Churchill's canoe to admire its sail of
canvas, and turned to wish us good day. The Indian woman leaned
over the boom to examine the stitching of the bolt rope, and at
that moment I heard Thompson's harsh voice.</p>

<p>"Get out of it!" he ordered abruptly.</p>

<p>The Indians glanced up courteously, not understanding the words,
and Thompson shouted again: "Grease off, damn you!" The Indian
couple glanced at us in bewilderment, and Churchill was opening his
mouth to speak when suddenly, without further warning, the seaman
leveled his musket and fired. The ball passed through the child and
through the father's chest; both fell dying on the beach, staining
the sand with their blood. The woman shrieked and people began to
run toward us from the house.</p>

<p>Churchill sprang to his feet and bounded to where Thompson sat,
with the smoking musket in his hand. One blow of his fist stretched
the murderer on the sand; he snatched up the musket, seized
Thompson's limp body under the arms, and ran, dragging him, to
where the canoe lay in the wash of the sea. Setting the musket
carefully against a thwart, he tossed his companion into the bilges
as if he had been a dead pig, then sprang into the canoe, pushing
off as he did so. Next moment he had sail on her; the little vessel
was making off swiftly to the west before the gathering crowd
understood what had occurred.</p>

<p>I rushed to the dying father and his small daughter, but
perceived at once that there was nothing to be done for them.
Within five minutes both expired. The moment it was ascertained
that they were dead the frantic mother seized her <i>paoniho</i>
and gashed her head in a shocking manner, while blood covered her
face and shoulders. The crew of her vessel armed themselves with
large stones and were beginning to gather about me threateningly
when Hitihiti appeared. He grasped the situation, and the sullen
murmur of the people died away as he held up an arm for
silence.</p>

<p>"This man is my <i>taio</i>," he said; "he is as innocent as
yourselves! Why do you stand there chattering like women? You have
weapons! Launch your canoe! I know the man who killed your master;
he is an evil-smelling dog, and not one of the Englishmen will lift
a hand to protect him!"</p>

<p>They set off at once in pursuit, but, as I learned afterwards,
they were unable to come up with the fugitives. The dead were
buried the same night, and Hina and Tehani did their best to
comfort the poor woman, whose home was on the neighbouring island
of Eimeo. The sequel to this tragedy came a fortnight later, when
Tehani and I returned to our home.</p>

<p>Fearing to land on the west side of Tahiti, and wishing to put
the greatest possible distance between themselves and Matavai,
Churchill had steered his canoe through the dangerous reefs at the
south end of Taiarapu and sailed on to Tautira, where Vehiatua,
supposing him to be one of my friends, had welcomed him. But
Thompson's reputation had preceded him, and he found himself
shunned and abhorred by all. Churchill was by this time heartily
sick of his companion and desired nothing better than to be rid of
him. He told me as much when he came to my house on the evening of
our arrival, musket in hand.</p>

<p>"I've half a mind to shoot the fellow!" he remarked. "Hanging's
too good for him! But damn me if I can shoot a man in cold blood! I
was a fool not to leave him to be dealt with by the Indians in
Matavai!"</p>

<p>"They'd have made short work of him," I said.</p>

<p>"And a bloody good job! I'm done with him. I told him to-day he
could have the canoe if he'd get out of here and not come
back."</p>

<p>"Leave him to the Indians," I suggested. "They'd have killed him
long since had he not been with you."</p>

<p>"Aye. Look&mdash;there he is now."</p>

<p>Thompson was seated alone on the beach, half a cable's length
from us, with the air of a man brooding over his wrongs, as he
nursed the musket between his knees.</p>

<p>"The man's half mad," growled Churchill. "You've a musket, Byam;
best load it and keep it handy till he's gone."</p>

<p>"Are you planning to stop in Tautira?" I asked after a
pause.</p>

<p>"Yes. I like the old chief&mdash;your father-in-law, whatever he
is&mdash;and he seems to like me. He's a fighting man, and so is
the other chief, Atuanui. We were planning a bit of a war last
night. He says if I'll help him he'll give me a piece of land, with
a fine young wife thrown in. But come&mdash;it is time we went to
his house."</p>

<p>Vehiatua had bidden us to witness a <i>heiva</i> that
evening&mdash;a night dance of the kind I had seen in Tetiaroa long
before. We found the grounds bright with torchlight and thronged
with spectators, and when we had greeted our friends, Tehani and I
seated ourselves with Churchill on the grass, on the outer fringe
of the audience.</p>

<p>The drums had scarcely struck up when I heard an Indian shout
warningly behind us, followed instantly by the report of a musket.
Churchill attempted to spring to his feet, but sank down coughing
beside me, the musket dropping from his nerveless hand. Women were
shrieking and men shouting on all sides, and I heard Vehiatua's
voice boom out above the uproar: "Aye! Kill him! Kill him!" In the
flickering torchlight I saw Thompson break away from the scuffle
behind me and begin to run toward the beach with ungainly bounds,
still clinging to his musket. Atuanui, the warrior chief, snatched
up a great stone and hurled it with his giant's arm. It struck the
murderer between the shoulders, and sent him sprawling. Next moment
the Indian warrior was upon him, beating out his brains with the
same stone that had brought him down. When I returned to the house,
Churchill was dead.</p>

<p>Since the Indians made war, and abandoned plans for war, for
reasons which struck me as frivolous in the extreme, the loss of
Churchill was accepted as an unfavourable omen by Vehiatua's
priests, and the expedition planned against the people of the south
coast of Eimeo was given up. I was secretly glad to be freed from
the duty of taking up arms against men to whom I bore no malice and
settled down with relief to a tranquil domestic life and my studies
of the Indian tongue.</p>

<p>I shall not cumber this narrative with my observations on the
life and customs of the Indians&mdash;their religion, their
intricate system of <i>tapu</i>, their manner of making war, their
<i>arioi</i> society, and their arts and sciences, all of which
have been fully described by Cook, Bougainville, and other early
visitors to Tahiti. But I shall do the people of Tahiti the justice
to mention two of their customs, shocking in themselves, but less
so when the reasons for them are made clear. I allude to
infanticide and human sacrifice.</p>

<p>Nowhere in the world are children cherished more tenderly than
in the South Sea, yet infanticide was considered by the Indians a
praiseworthy act of self-sacrifice. The object of the <i>arioi</i>
society&mdash;the strolling players whose chiefs were of the most
considerable families in Tahiti&mdash;was to set an example both to
chiefs and to commoners, as a warning against overpopulating the
island. Should a member of the society give birth to a female
child, it was killed at once, in the quickest and most painless
manner, and their greatest term of contempt was <i>vahine
fanaunau</i>&mdash;a fertile woman. The Indians had a perfect
understanding of the dangers of overpopulation, and guarded against
them by making large families unfashionable. Cruel as the method
seems, it should not be criticized without reflecting that men
increase, while the amount of habitable land on a small island
remains the same.</p>

<p>As for human sacrifice, the ceremony was rarely performed, and
then only on the altar of Oro, god of war. The victim was taken
unaware and killed mercifully, by a sudden blow from behind, and he
was without exception a man who, in the opinion of the chiefs,
deserved death for the public good. In a land where courts, judges,
and executioners were unknown, the prospect of being sacrificed to
the god of war restrained many a man from crimes against
society.</p>

<p>The people of Tahiti were fortunate in many respects&mdash;the
climate, the fertility of their island, and the abundance of food
to be obtained with little effort; yet they were still more
fortunate, perhaps, in their lack of money or any other general
medium of exchange. Hogs, mats, or bark cloth might be given as a
reward for building a house or the tattooing of a young chief, but
such property was perishable, and considered a gift rather than an
exchange. Since there was nothing that a miser might hoard,
avarice, that most contemptible of human failings, was unknown, and
there was little incentive to greed. To be accused of meanness was
dreaded by chief and commoner alike, for a mean man was considered
an object of ridicule. By our introduction of iron, and inculcation
of the principles of barter, there is no doubt that we have worked
the Indians infinite harm.</p>

<p>On the fifteenth of August, 1790, our daughter Helen was born.
The child was given Tehani's name and long title, which in truth I
cannot recollect, but I gave her my mother's name as well. She was
a lovely little creature, with strange and beautiful eyes, dark
blue as the sea, and since she was our first-born, or
<i>matahiapo</i>, her birth was the occasion for ceremonies
religious and political.</p>

<p>A large enclosure had been fenced on the sacred ground behind
Vehiatua's family temple, and three small houses built within. The
first was called "The House of Sweet Fern," in which the mother was
to be delivered of her child; the second was known as "The House of
the Weak," where mother and child would pass a fortnight
afterwards; the third was called "The Common House" and had been
built to shelter Tehani's attendants. For six days after our little
Helen was born, silence reigned on sea and land along the coast of
Tiarapu; all of the commoners retiring into the mountain
fastnesses, where they might converse, build fires for their
cooking, and live in comfort till the restriction was over.</p>

<p>On the seventh day I was admitted into the House of the Weak,
and saw my daughter for the first time. Vehiatua and I went
together, for no man save Taomi, the priest, had set foot within
the enclosure till that time. It was dark in the house, and for a
moment I could scarcely make out Tehani on her couch of soft mats
and tapa, nor the tiny newcomer, waving chubby fists at me.</p>

<p>Our child was three months old when Stewart and Peggy sailed
around the island to visit us. They had a small daughter of their
own, as I had learned some time before, and the two young mothers
found in their children an inexhaustible subject of conversation.
Stewart spent a week with us, and one day of the seven stands out
in my memory.</p>

<p>It was still dark when I rose that morning, but when I emerged
from my plunge into the river the fowls were beginning to flutter
down from the trees. As I stood on the bank, breathing deep of the
cool morning air, I felt a touch on my shoulder and found my wife
beside me.</p>

<p>"They are still asleep," she said; "you should see Helen and
little Peggy, side by side! Look, there is not a cloud in the sky!
Let us take a small canoe and paddle to Fenua Ino&mdash;the four of
us, and the children, and Tuahu."</p>

<p>We had often spoken of spending a day on the islet of Fenua Ino,
a place I had never visited, and, knowing that Stewart would enjoy
the trip, I assented readily. We chose a single canoe, stocked her
with provisions and drinking-nuts, and installed the two sleeping
babies on soft tapa, side by side in the shell of a large
sea-turtle, well polished and cleaned, and shaded with green
coconut fronds. Tuahu, my brother-in-law, was a tall, powerful
young man, a year older than I, and as pleasant a companion as I
have ever known. He took his place in the stern, to steer us
through the reefs, and set us a lively stroke. Stewart and I had
long since become accomplished hands in a canoe, and our wives were
strong, active girls, able to wield a paddle with any man.</p>

<p>For five miles south from Tautira, the coast is sheltered by a
reef at some distance from the land, and is perhaps the richest and
most densely populated district in all Tahiti. This was the coast I
had seen when the <i>Bounty</i> first approached the island, so
long before. Then the reef ceases, and the Pacific thunders against
the tall green cliffs called Te Pari&mdash;a wild region,
uninhabited and believed to be the haunt of evil spirits. At the
beginning of the cliffs, where the reef ended, was the small coral
island, about half a mile from shore, where we planned to spend the
day.</p>

<p>We spread our mats in the shade of a great unfamiliar tree, and
Tuahu fetched our lunch and the turtle shell. Stewart called to his
wife: "Bring the children, Peggy. Byam and I will keep an eye on
them, and have a yarn while you and Tehani explore the island."</p>

<p>Stewart and I stretched ourselves out comfortably in the shade.
Our daughters slept in their odd cradle, starting a little from
time to time as babies do, but never opening an eye.</p>

<p>"Byam, what do you suppose has become of Christian?" Stewart
asked. "Sometimes I think that he may have killed himself."</p>

<p>"Never! He felt too deeply his responsibility toward the
others."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right. By this time they must have settled on
some island&mdash;I wonder where!"</p>

<p>"I have often puzzled over that question," I replied. "They
might have gone to one of the Navigators' Islands, or to any of the
coral islands we passed on the voyage north."</p>

<p>Stewart shook his head. "I think not," he said; "those places
are too well known. There must be scores of rich islands still
uncharted in this part of the sea. Christian would be more apt to
search for some such place, where he would be safer from
pursuit."</p>

<p>I made no reply and for a long time we lay sprawled in the
shade, our hands behind our heads. I felt deeply the lonely peace
and beauty of the islet. Beyond the long white curve of the reef, a
northerly breeze ruffled the Pacific gently. I groped in memory for
a phrase of Greek and at last it came to me&mdash;"wine-dark sea."
Stewart spoke, half to himself, as if putting his thoughts into
words: "What a place for a hermit's meditations!"</p>

<p>"Would you like to live here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But I would miss the sight of English faces. You,
Byam, living alone among the Indians, do you never miss your own
kind?"</p>

<p>I thought for a moment before I replied: "Not thus far."</p>

<p>Stewart smiled. "You are half Indian already. Dearly as I love
Peggy, I would be less happy at Matavai without Ellison. I've grown
fond of the lad, and he spends half his time at our house. It's a
damned shame he had to meddle in the mutiny."</p>

<p>"There's not an ounce of harm in the young idiot," I said; "and
now he must sail away with Morrison and pass the rest of his days
in hiding, on some cannibal island to the west. All for the
pleasure of waving a bayonet under Bligh's nose!"</p>

<p>"They'll be launching the <i>Resolution</i> in another six
weeks," remarked Stewart. "Morrison has done wonders! She's a
staunch little ship, fit to weather anything."</p>

<p>Our wives were approaching us, followed by Tuahu, who carried a
mass of sweet-scented flowers which they had woven into wreaths for
us.</p>

<p>One flower in particular, in long sprays and wonderfully
fragrant, took my fancy. It was unknown on Tahiti, and our
companions were trying to recall its name.</p>

<p>"It is common in the low islands east of here, where the people
eat man," said Tuahu; "I saw hundreds of the trees in Anaa, when I
was there last year. They have a name for it in their language, as
we have in ours, but I forget both."</p>

<p>"<i>Tafano!</i>" exclaimed Tehani, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Aye, that's it!" said her brother, and I made a note of the
word for my dictionary.</p>

<p>We fetched the baskets of food for the girls, and retired to a
little distance, Indian fashion, to eat our own lunch. When it was
over and we were together once more, in the shade, Tuahu recounted
the legend of the islet.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you why no men live here?" he began. "It is
because of the danger at night. Several times in the past men have
tried to sleep here, out of bravado, or because they did not know.
All have crossed to Tahiti in the morning silent and dejected, and
died soon after, raving mad. Since the very beginning, a woman has
come here each night when the sun has set. She is more lovely than
any mortal, with a melodious voice, long shining hair, and eyes no
man can resist. Her pleasure is to seduce mortal men, knowing that
her embraces mean madness and death."</p>

<p>Stewart winked at me. He plucked two blades of coarse grass, a
long and a short, and held them out. "Come," he said banteringly,
with a glance at the girls, "we'll draw to see who stops the
night."</p>

<p>But Tehani snatched the grass from his hand. "Stop the night if
you like," she said to Stewart, "but Byam goes ashore! I want no
demon-woman for him, nor mortal girls who would swim out to
impersonate her!"</p>

<p>Stewart sailed for Matavai on the day after our picnic, and four
months passed before I saw him again. Yet as I review those months
in memory, they seem no longer than so many weeks. It has often
been observed&mdash;with a justice for which I can vouch&mdash;that
in the South Sea men lose their sense of the passage of time. In a
climate where perpetual summer reigns and there is little to
distinguish one week from another, the days slip by
imperceptibly.</p>

<p>That year of 1790 was the happiest and seemed the shortest of my
entire life. And 1791 began happily enough; January passed, and
February, and toward the middle of March Tehani sailed with
Vehiatua to the other side of the island, to take part in some
religious ceremony. The Indian ceremonies of this nature were
wearisome to me, and I decided to remain in Tautira, with my
brother-in-law. My wife had been gone a week or more when the ship
came.</p>

<p>Tuahu and I had been amusing ourselves at a <i>heiva</i> the
night before, and, returning late to bed, I slept till the sun was
up. Tuahu woke me with a hand on my shoulder. "Byam!" he said in a
voice breathless with excitement. "Wake up! A ship! A ship!"</p>

<p>Rubbing the sleep from my eyes, I followed him to the beach,
where numbers of people were already gathering. All were staring
out to the east, into the dazzling light of the morning sun. There
was a light breeze at east by north, and far offshore, so far that
she was hull-down and her courses hidden by the curve of the world,
I saw a European ship. Topsails, topgallants, and
royals&mdash;looking small, dark, and weatherbeaten in the level
light&mdash;were visible, though the distance was still too great
to guess at her nationality. The Indians were in great
excitement.</p>

<p>"If a Spanish ship," I heard one man say, "she will put in
here."</p>

<p>"And if French, she will go to Hitiaa!"</p>

<p>"British ships always go to Matavai," said Tuahu, glancing at me
for confirmation.</p>

<p>"Do you think she is British?" asked Tetuanui, my wife's old
aunt. I shrugged my shoulders, and an Indian said: "She is not
Spanish, anyway. They are standing off too far."</p>

<p>The vessel was approaching the land on the starboard tack, and
it was clear that she was not steering for the Spanish anchorage at
Pueu. She might have been a French frigate making for
Bougainville's harbour, or a British vessel bound for Matavai. We
seated ourselves on the grass, and presently, as she drew slightly
nearer and the light increased, I was all but convinced, from the
shape of her topsails, that she was British. I sprang to my
feet.</p>

<p>"Tuahu," I said, "I believe she's British! Let us take your
small sailing canoe and run down to Matavai."</p>

<p>My brother-in-law sprang up eagerly. "We shall beat them there
by hours," he exclaimed; "this wind always blows strongest close to
land. They will be becalmed offshore."</p>

<p>We made a hasty breakfast on cold pork and yams, left over from
the night before, had the canoe well stocked with provisions and
drinking nuts, and set sail within the hour, accompanied by one
man. As Tuahu had predicted, the wind blew strong alongshore, while
the vessel four or five miles distant lay almost becalmed. With the
fresh breeze abeam, our canoe tore through the sheltered water
within the reefs, headed out into the open sea at Pueu, and sailed
past Hitiaa and Tiarei. It was mid-afternoon when we ran through
the gentle breakers before Hitihiti's house. The place was
deserted, for news of the ship had preceded us, and my <i>taio</i>,
with all his household, had repaired to the lookout point on One
Tree Hill.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c14" id="c14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.&mdash;THE PANDORA</h2>

<p>Throughout the day the Indians had been coming to Matavai in
great numbers, and many canoes were drawn up on the beach,
belonging to those who had arrived from remote parts of the island.
When I climbed One Tree Hill, late in the afternoon, I found it
thronged with people keeping a lookout for the vessel. The
excitement was intense. It was such a scene as must have presented
itself twenty-four years earlier when Captain Wallis arrived in the
<i>Dolphin</i>, the first European vessel to visit the island. The
crowd was so great that I had difficulty in finding Stewart.
Presently I spied him with some of the Matavai people, standing
near the ancient flowering tree which gave the hill its name. He
made his way to me at once.</p>

<p>"I've been expecting you all day, Byam," he said. "What can you
tell me of the ship? You must have seen her as you were coming
round the coast."</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied. "She's an English frigate, I should say."</p>

<p>"I thought as much," he replied, sadly. "I suppose I should be
glad. In one sense, I am, of course. But fate has played a sorry
trick upon us. You must feel that, too?"</p>

<p>I did feel it, profoundly. The first sight of the vessel had
given me a moment of keen happiness. I knew that it meant home; but
after all these months Tahiti was home as well, and I realized that
I was bound to the island by ties no less strong than those which
drew me from it. Either to go or to stay seemed a cruel choice; but
we well knew that there would be no choice. Our duty was plain. We
should have to go aboard as soon as the ship came to anchor and
report the mutiny.</p>

<p>We had little doubt that the vessel had been sent out in search
of the <i>Bounty</i>. The Indians, of course, had no inkling of
this. They believed that the awaited ship probably belonged to
Captain Cook, coming for additional supplies of young breadfruit
trees, and that Captain Bligh, his supposed son, would be with him.
While Stewart and I were talking, a messenger from Teina was sent
in search of us. He wished to see us at his house. We sent back
word that we would come shortly.</p>

<p>"What of our wives and children?" Stewart asked gloomily. "It
may seem strange to you, Byam, but the truth is that I have never
before realized that we should have to go. England seems so far
away, as though it were on another planet."</p>

<p>"I know," I replied. "My feeling has been the same."</p>

<p>He shook his head mournfully. "Let's not talk of it. You are
certain the ship is English?"</p>

<p>"All but certain."</p>

<p>"In that case, I'm sorry for poor Morrison. He left in the
schooner four days ago. They may be well on their way westward by
this time."</p>

<p>Morrison's plans, he told me, had not changed. All the mutineers
remaining on Tahiti, with the exception of Skinner, had decided to
go with him in the <i>Resolution</i>. They had agreed among
themselves to go ashore at some island to the westward where there
would be little chance of their ever being discovered. Morrison,
Norman, McIntosh, Byrne, and Muspratt would then try to make their
way to Batavia, on the island of Java, where they hoped to sell the
schooner and take passage in some ship bound to Europe.</p>

<p>"It's a desperate venture for all of them," Stewart continued.
"There are Ellison, Hillbrandt, Burkitt, Millward, and Sumner to be
left at some island yet to be decided upon. God knows what their
fate will be! They have firearms and think they will be able to
defend themselves until they can establish friendly relations with
the people. But what can five men do against hundreds of savages?
We know what the islanders to the westward are like; our
experiences at Namuka taught us that. They are as good as dead, in
my opinion."</p>

<p>"They will have a fighting chance at least," I said. "In any
event it will be better than being taken home to be hung."</p>

<p>"Yes, they were wise to go, no doubt. What chance do you think
Morrison has of reaching Batavia?"</p>

<p>We discussed the matter at length. Morrison was an excellent
navigator, and five men were ample to work the little schooner.
They were provided with a compass and one of Captain Bligh's charts
of the passage through Endeavour Straits; but looked at in the most
hopeful light, it seemed doubtful indeed that the <i>Resolution</i>
would ever reach Batavia. Stewart told me that the schooner had
first gone to the district of Papara, on the southern side of
Tahiti, to pick up McIntosh, Hillbrandt, and Millward. It was
possible, he thought, that the schooner might still be there.</p>

<p>Presently a great shout went up from the watchers on the hill.
The frigate had been sighted as she emerged from behind a distant
headland. She was four or five miles offshore, and the dying wind
was so light that we knew she could not make the land before dark.
Evidently her captain realized this, for shortly afterward the ship
hove-to under her topsails.</p>

<p>Some of the Indians remained on the hill, but most of them,
seeing that the vessel did not intend to come in that night,
descended with us. On our way to Teina's house we met Skinner and
Coleman, who had been on an excursion into the mountains and had
only just heard the news of the frigate. Coleman was deeply moved
when I told him that the ship was, almost certainly, English. More
than any of us, with the exception of Morrison, had he longed for
home. He had a wife and children there and had formed no alliance
with any of the Tahitian women. Tears of joy dimmed his eyes, and
without waiting for further information he rushed up the hill for a
sight of the vessel that would take him to England.</p>

<p>Stewart and I were concerned for Skinner. He had long since
repented of the part he had taken in the mutiny, and was, in fact,
the only one of the mutineers who had done so. His sense of guilt
had grown stronger as the months had passed. A deeply religious
man, he had brooded over his disloyalty to the Crown and was
determined to give himself up at the first opportunity. We knew
that repentance, however sincere, would have no weight with a
court-martial. His doom was certain if he surrendered himself.
Guilty though he undoubtedly was, we had no desire to see the poor
fellow clapped into irons and taken to England to be hung. But he
would not listen to our suggestions that he try to hide himself
while there was yet time.</p>

<p>"I have no wish to escape," he said. "I know what will happen
when I surrender myself, but my death will be a warning to others
who may be tempted to mutiny."</p>

<p>We pleaded with him for some time, but it was useless, so we
left him and proceeded to Teina's house. We found the chief at
supper, which he asked us to share with him, and while we ate he
plied us with questions concerning the vessel. How many guns was
she likely to carry? How many men? Would King George be aboard? And
the like. All the Tahitians had a great desire to see the King of
England, and Bligh, as well as the British captains who had visited
the island before him, had played upon their credulity to the
extent of giving them reason to hope that the King might some day
visit Tahiti.</p>

<p>We explained to Teina that King George had great dominions, and
was so occupied with affairs at home, particularly in wars with
neighboring nations, that he had little opportunity for voyaging to
such far places.</p>

<p>"But Tut&eacute; will come," Teina said, with conviction.
(Tut&eacute; was the universal name for Captain Cook, the nearest
they could come to the sound of it; and Bligh was called Parai.)
"Parai promised that Tut&eacute; would come. This must be his
ship." He went on to conjecture what the purpose of this visit
might be. He believed that Cook and Bligh, if the latter chanced to
be with him, would now decide to remain permanently at Tahiti. He
would urge them to do so, and would set aside great tracts of land
for their use and provide them with as many servants as they might
want. With their help he would bring the whole of Tahiti under
subjection; then we would all proceed to the island of Eimeo, and
on to Raiatea and Bora Bora, conquering each of these islands in
turn. And he promised that Stewart and I should be made great
chiefs, and that our children should grow in power after us.</p>

<p>It must have been well past midnight when we left Teina's house,
but none of the people there or elsewhere thought of sleep that
night. Those who had come from distant parts were encamped along
the beach and among the groves inland, and the light of their fires
illuminated the entire circle of the bay. Canoes were still
arriving, most of them small craft containing ten or a dozen men,
bringing island produce to be bartered for the trade goods of the
vessel. As we walked down the beach we saw one huge canoe,
containing fifty or more paddlers, just entering the bay. Her men
were singing as they urged her forward, and the blades of the
paddles flashed in the firelight as they approached. It was an
interesting sight to watch them berth her. With her great curved
stern rising high above the water, she looked like some strange sea
monster. She was heavily loaded and grounded at some distance from
the beach, whereupon all the men leaped out and brought her farther
along. There must have been one hundred people in her, to say
nothing of the cargo of pigs and fowls. When these had been
unloaded, rollers were placed under her keel, and with twenty or
thirty men on each side she was quickly run up the long slope of
the beach to level ground.</p>

<p>We went to Stewart's house, which stood just under One Tree
Hill, on the western side of the bay. Here, too, everyone was
astir. Peggy, Stewart's wife, with their little daughter asleep on
the mat beside her, was sorting over great rolls of tapa cloth,
selecting the finest pieces as gifts for her husband's friends on
the ship. She took it for granted that we must know everyone
aboard, and it was plain that she had no suspicion of what the
arrival of the vessel might mean to us both. Presently I went off
to seek Tuahu and my other friends from Tautira who were encamped
near by. By this time dawn was not far off, and Tuahu suggested
that we should take a canoe and paddle out to sea to meet the
vessel.</p>

<p>"If it is a strange ship, Byam, the captain will be glad of a
pilot into the bay. But I think it is Parai coming back to see us.
We shall be the first to met him."</p>

<p>I agreed to the proposal at once, and taking old Paoto, Tuahu's
servant, with us, we hauled our canoe to the water, and a few
moments later had rounded Point Venus and were well out to sea.</p>

<p>Tahiti had never seemed so beautiful as on that morning, in the
faint light of dawn. The stars were shining brightly when we set
out, but they faded gradually, and the island stood out in clear,
cold silhouette against the sky. We paddled steadily for half an
hour before we caught sight of the ship, and then drifted to wait
for her to come up with us. The breeze was of the lightest, and an
hour later she was still at a considerable distance. She was a
frigate of twenty-four guns, and, although I was convinced that she
was British, my heart leaped when at last I saw the English
colours.</p>

<p>In my first eagerness to go off to her, I had forgotten that I
was dressed as an Indian and not as an English midshipman. My only
remaining uniform had come to grief at Tautira. I had not worn it
from the day I left the <i>Bounty</i>, but had kept it carefully
wrapped in a piece of tapa cloth hanging from a rafter in my house.
Thinking it safe there, I had not examined the parcel in many
months, and when at last I did so I found that it had been nearly
devoured by rats, and was past all hope of repair. This mattered
nothing then, for I had long since adopted the Tahitian costume,
and for the most part wore nothing but a girdle of tapa and a
turban of the same material. Reminded now of my half-naked
condition, I was tempted to turn back, but it was too late to
reconsider. The vessel was only a few hundred yards distant and had
altered her course to pick us up.</p>

<p>The larboard bulwarks were crowded with men, and I saw the
captain on the quarter-deck with his spyglass leveled at us, and a
group of officers standing behind him. As the ship came alongside
we paddled with her, and a line was thrown to us from the gangway.
I clambered aboard and Tuahu after me. Paoto remained in the canoe,
which was veered astern and towed after us.</p>

<p>My skin was as brown as that of the Indians themselves, and,
with my arms covered with tattooing, it is not strange that I
should have been mistaken for a Tahitian. A lieutenant stood at the
gangway, and as we reached the deck sailors and marines alike
crowded close for a better view. The lieutenant smiled
ingratiatingly and patted Tuahu on the shoulder. "Maitai! Maitai!"
(Good! Good!) he said. This was evidently the only Indian word he
knew.</p>

<p>"You can address him in English, sir," I said, smiling. "He
understands it very well. My name is Byam, Roger Byam, late
midshipman of His Majesty's ship <i>Bounty</i>. If you like, I
shall be glad to pilot you in to the anchorage."</p>

<p>The expression on the lieutenant's face altered at once. Without
replying he glanced me up and down, from head to foot.</p>

<p>"Corporal of marines!" he called.</p>

<p>The corporal advanced and saluted.</p>

<p>"Fall in a guard and take this man aft."</p>

<p>To my astonishment four men with muskets and bayonets fixed were
told off, and I was placed in the midst of them, and in this manner
marched to the captain, who awaited us on the quarter-deck. The
lieutenant preceded us. "Here's one of the pirates, sir," he
said.</p>

<p>"That I am not, sir!" I replied. "No more than you
yourself!"</p>

<p>"Silence!" the captain ordered. He regarded me with an
expression of cold hostility, but I was too incensed at the
accusation to hold my tongue.</p>

<p>"Allow me to speak, sir," I said. "I am not one of the
mutineers. My name is..."</p>

<p>"Did you hear me, you scoundrel? I ordered you to be
silent!"</p>

<p>I was hot with shame and anger, but I had self-possession enough
not to give way further to it, and I was certain that the
misunderstanding with respect to me would soon be cleared up. I saw
Tuahu regarding me with an expression of utter amazement. I was not
permitted to speak to him.</p>

<p>The most humiliating treatment was yet to come. The armourer was
sent for, and a few moments later handcuffs were placed upon me and
I was taken under guard to the captain's cabin, there to await his
pleasure. Two hours passed, during which time I was kept standing
by the door. I saw no one except the guards, who refused to speak
to me. Meanwhile the ship had been worked into Matavai Bay and came
to anchor at the same spot where the <i>Bounty</i> had lain upon
her arrival nearly three years earlier. Through the ports I could
see the throngs of Indians along the shore and canoes putting off
to the frigate. In one of the first of these were Coleman and
Stewart. Stewart was dressed in his midshipman's uniform, and
Coleman in an old jacket and a pair of trousers patched with pieces
of tapa cloth, all that remained of his European clothing. Their
canoes passed under the counter and I saw no more of them for some
time.</p>

<p>The frigate was called the <i>Pandora</i>, and she was commanded
by Captain Edward Edwards, a tall spare man with cold blue eyes and
pale bony hands and face. As soon as the ship was safely anchored
he came to his cabin, followed by one of his lieutenants, Mr.
Parkin. He seated himself at his table and ordered me to be brought
before him. I protested at once against the treatment I had
received, but he ordered me to be silent, and sat for some time
regarding me as though I were a curiosity brought to him for
examination. Having finished his scrutiny, he leaned back in his
chair and gazed sternly at my face.</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Roger Byam."</p>

<p>"You were a midshipman on His Majesty's armed vessel, the
<i>Bounty</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"How many of the <i>Bounty's</i> company are now on the island
of Tahiti?"</p>

<p>"Three, I believe, not counting myself."</p>

<p>"Who are they?"</p>

<p>I gave him their names.</p>

<p>"Where is Fletcher Christian, and where is the
<i>Bounty</i>?"</p>

<p>I told him of Christian's departure with eight of the mutineers,
and of all the events that had taken place at Tahiti since that
time. I told him of the building of the schooner, under Morrison's
supervision, and of Morrison's intention to sail with her to
Batavia, where he hoped to find a homeward-bound ship.</p>

<p>"A likely story!" he said grimly. "In that case, why did not you
go with him?"</p>

<p>"Because the schooner was not well found for so long a voyage.
It seemed to me wiser to wait here for the arrival of an English
ship."</p>

<p>"Which you never expected to see, no doubt. You will be
surprised to learn that Captain Bligh, and the men who were driven
from his ship with him, have succeeded in reaching England?"</p>

<p>"I am profoundly glad to hear it, sir."</p>

<p>"And you will be equally surprised to learn that all the facts
of the mutiny, including that of your own villainy, are known."</p>

<p>"My villainy, sir? I am as free from guilt in that affair as any
member of your own ship's company!"</p>

<p>"You dare to deny that you plotted with Christian to seize the
<i>Bounty</i>?"</p>

<p>"Surely, sir, you must know that some of us who were left in the
ship were compelled to remain for lack of accommodation in the
launch? There were nine of us who took no part whatever in the
mutiny. The launch was so overloaded that Captain Bligh himself
begged that no more men should be sent into her; and he promised,
if ever he reached England, to do justice to those of us who were
forced to remain behind. Why, then, am I treated as though I were a
pirate? If Captain Bligh were here..."</p>

<p>Edwards cut me short.</p>

<p>"That will do," he said. "You will meet Captain Bligh in good
time, when you have been taken to England to suffer the punishment
you so richly merit. Now then, will you or will you not tell me
where the <i>Bounty</i> is to be found?"</p>

<p>"I have told you all that I know, sir."</p>

<p>"I shall find her and those who went with her, be sure of that.
And I promise that neither you nor they shall gain by an attempt to
shield them."</p>

<p>I was too angry and sick at heart to reply. Never, during all
the months that had passed since the mutiny, had I suspected that I
might be considered a member of Christian's party. Although I had
not been able to speak with Bligh on the morning the ship was
seized, Nelson, and others who went in the launch, knew of my
loyalty and of my intention to leave with them. I had supposed that
Bligh himself must have known, and I could not imagine what might
have happened to cause me to be listed among the mutineers. I was
eager to know the fate of those who had gone with Bligh, and how
many of them had reached England safely, but Edwards would not
permit me to inquire.</p>

<p>"You are here to be questioned, not I," he said. "You still
refuse to tell me where Christian is?"</p>

<p>"I know no more than you do, sir," I replied.</p>

<p>He turned to the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Mr. Parkin, have this man sent below, and see to it that he has
no communication with anyone...Wait a moment. Ask Mr. Hayward to
step in."</p>

<p>My surprise at the mention of Hayward's name must have been
apparent. A moment later the door opened, and Thomas Hayward, my
former messmate on the <i>Bounty</i>, appeared. Forgetting my
shackles, I stepped forward to greet him, but he gazed at me with a
look of contempt, at the same time putting his hands behind his
back.</p>

<p>"You know this man, Mr. Hayward?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He is Roger Byam, a former midshipman on the
<i>Bounty</i>."</p>

<p>"That will do," said Edwards. With another cool glance at me,
Hayward went out, and I was taken by the guard to the orlop deck,
to a place evidently prepared for prisoners, next to the bread
room. It was a foul situation, below the water line, and nauseating
with the stench of the bilges. The only means of ventilation was a
ladderway some distance forward. Irons were now placed on my legs
as well as on my wrists, and here I was left, with two guards
outside the door at either end of the compartment. About an hour
later, Stewart, Coleman, and Skinner were brought down and ironed
in the same manner. No one, save the guard who brought our food,
was permitted to enter the place, and we were forbidden to speak to
each other. There we lay the whole of that interminable day, as
wretched in mind and body as men could well be.</p>

<h2><a name="c15" id="c15"></a>CHAPTER XV.&mdash;DOCTOR
HAMILTON</h2>

<p>During the next four days, Stewart, Coleman, Skinner, and I were
conscious of little save our own misery. A frigate's orlop deck is
a foul place in which to be confined at any time, and with the ship
at anchor, in the lee of a tropical island, the heat and stench
were scarcely to be endured. Our sentinels were changed every two
hours, and I remember with what longing we watched the departing
guard returning to the freshness of the open air. Food was brought
to us morning and evening, and only thus were we able to
distinguish night from day, for no sunlight penetrated to our
quarters. Our victuals were the rancid salt beef and hard bread
which the <i>Pandora</i> had carried all the way from England, with
never an addition of the fresh meat, fruit, and vegetables which
the island furnished in such abundance. But more than food we
craved fresh air and the luxury of movement. Our leg irons were
made fast to ringbolts in the planking, and although we could rise
to our feet, we could take no more than one short step in either
direction.</p>

<p>On the fifth morning of our confinement, the corporal of marines
appeared with an extra guard. My leg irons were removed and I was
taken up the ladderway and aft along the gundeck to a cabin on the
starboard side of the vessel. It was the surgeon's cabin, and the
surgeon himself, Dr. Hamilton, was awaiting me there. He dismissed
the guard and then, observing that I was in handcuffs, recalled the
corporal and requested that these be removed. The man was reluctant
to comply.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Parkin's orders were..."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," the doctor interrupted. "Take them off. I'll answer
for this man's safety." The irons were then removed and once more
the corporal retired. The surgeon turned the key in the lock,
smiling as he did so.</p>

<p>"I'm not taking this precaution against yourself, Mr. Byam," he
said. "I wish our conversation to be uninterrupted. Please to be
seated."</p>

<p>He was a sturdily built man of forty, or thereabout, with a
pleasant voice and manner. He looked like a ship's surgeon and a
capable one. I felt drawn to him immediately. After the treatment
accorded us by Edwards and Parkin, mere courtesy seemed, by
contrast, the highest of virtues. I seated myself on his clothes
chest and waited for him to speak.</p>

<p>"First," he said, "about your studies of the Tahitian language.
You will wonder how I know of them. Of that, presently. Have you
continued them during your sojourn here?"</p>

<p>"I have, sir," I replied. "Not a day has passed that I have not
added to my dictionary. I have also compiled a grammar for the use
of those who may wish to study the language hereafter."</p>

<p>"Good! Sir Joseph Banks was not mistaken, I see, in the
confidence he placed in you."</p>

<p>"Sir Joseph! You know him, sir?" I asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Not as intimately as I could wish. In fact, I met him only
shortly before the <i>Pandora</i> sailed; but he is an esteemed
friend of friends of mine."</p>

<p>"Then you can tell me whether he believes me guilty in this
affair of the mutiny. Do you yourself, sir, think I could have been
so mad as to have joined it? And yet I have been treated by Captain
Edwards as though I were one of the ringleaders."</p>

<p>The surgeon regarded me gravely for a moment.</p>

<p>"I will say this, Mr. Byam, if it will afford you comfort. You
have not the look of a guilty man. As for Sir Joseph, despite all
that has been said against you, he still believes in your
innocence...</p>

<p>"Wait! Allow me to continue," he went on as I was about to
interrupt him. "I am as ready to hear what you have to say as you
are to speak; but let me first inform you how serious the charges
laid against you seem to be. I have been informed on this matter by
Sir Joseph, who has not only talked with Captain Bligh, but has
read the sworn statement concerning the mutiny which he has
furnished to the Admiralty. I will not give the details. One will
suffice to show how deeply you are implicated. On the night before
the <i>Bounty</i> was seized, Captain Bligh himself, coming on deck
during the middle watch, surprised you and Mr. Christian in earnest
conversation. And Captain Bligh, so he insists, overheard you say
to Mr. Christian: 'You can count on me, sir,' or words to that
precise effect."</p>

<p>I was so taken aback as to be speechless for a moment. However
strange it may seem, although I had the clearest recollection of
the conversation with Christian, this vastly important detail had
quite slipped from memory. The excitement of the events immediately
following had, I suppose, driven it from my mind. Now that it had
been recalled to me, I realized at once how black the appearances
against me must be, and that Bligh was justified in placing the
most damning construction upon what I had said. What could he have
believed except that I was pledging my allegiance to Christian in
his plan to seize the ship?</p>

<p>Dr. Hamilton sat with his hands clasped, his elbows on the arms
of his chair, waiting for me to speak.</p>

<p>"It is plain from your manner, Mr. Byam, that you have a
recollection of such a conversation."</p>

<p>"I have, sir. I said those very words to Mr. Christian, and
under the circumstances described by Captain Bligh." I then
proceeded to tell him the whole story of the mutiny, omitting
nothing. He heard me through without comment. When I had finished
he gazed at me keenly; then he said, "My boy, you have convinced
me, and here's my hand on it!" I shook it warmly. "But I must tell
you that my conviction is due to your manner rather than to the
matter you have related. You must see for yourself that the very
plausibility of your story is against it."</p>

<p>"How is that, sir?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Understand&mdash;I believe you; but put yourself in the place
of the ships' captains who will sit at the court-martial. Your
sincerity of manner in telling the story will have weight with them
too, but they will be justified in ascribing this to your longing
to escape death. As to the story, could you blame them for thinking
it a little too perfect to fit the facts? It meets your necessities
so well. The damning words to Christian are completely explained.
And your going below, on the morning of the mutiny, just before the
launch was cast off, is perfectly explained as well. There is not
one of those captains who will not say to himself: 'This is such a
tale as one would expect an intelligent midshipman, eager to save
his life, to invent.'"</p>

<p>"But, as I have told you, sir, Robert Tinkler overheard the
conversation with Christian. He can corroborate every word of my
testimony."</p>

<p>"Yes; Tinkler, I think, saves you. Your life is in his hands. He
reached England safely with the rest of Captain Bligh's party. To
return to your story, you see how difficult it will be to convince
a court-martial that Mr. Christian, presumably a man of
intelligence and one capable of reflection, would have considered
the mad plan of casting himself adrift on a tiny raft, for the
purpose of making his way, alone, to an island peopled with
savages?"</p>

<p>"It would not seem improbable if they knew Christian's character
and the abuse he had received from Captain Bligh."</p>

<p>"But these officers will know nothing of Christian's character,
and their sympathies will all be with Captain Bligh. You will have
to prove your story of that conversation beyond the shadow of a
doubt. Was there no one at that time to whom he revealed his plan
to leave the ship? Such a man would be a most important witness for
you."</p>

<p>"Yes; John Norton, one of the quartermasters. He prepared the
raft for Christian."</p>

<p>The surgeon opened a drawer in his table and brought forth a
paper. "I have here a list of the men who went with Captain Bligh
in the launch. Twelve of the party survived to reach England."</p>

<p>He glanced down the list, and then looked at me gravely.</p>

<p>"Norton, I am sorry to say, is not one of them. According to
this record he was killed by the savages on the island of
Tofoa."</p>

<p>It was a shock to me to learn of Norton's death, and I realized
what a misfortune the lack of his evidence would be for me. Mr.
Nelson, too, was dead, having succumbed to a fever when the party
reached Coupang. Mr. Nelson was not only my friend; he was also a
witness who could have vouched for my intention to leave the ship.
With these two gone, my chance for acquittal seemed much less
hopeful. Dr. Hamilton took a more encouraging view of the
situation.</p>

<p>"You must not be disheartened," he said. "Tinkler's evidence is
vastly more important to you than that of Norton and Mr. Nelson,
and you may be sure that he will be summoned. Sir Joseph Banks will
see to it that every scrap of evidence in your favour is brought to
bear. No, take my word for it, your case is far from hopeless."</p>

<p>His quiet confident manner reassured me, and for the time I put
aside all thought of what my fate might be. Mr. Hamilton then
related, briefly, what I was most eager to hear: the story of what
had happened to Bligh and his party after the launch had been cast
adrift. They had first called at the island of Tofoa, for water and
other refreshment, but the savages, seeing that the party lacked
the means of defending themselves, attacked them in such numbers
that a massacre of the entire company was barely averted. As it
happened, Norton was the only man to be killed. Their subsequent
adventures made up a record of appalling hardships, and had any one
but Bligh been in command, there is little doubt that the launch
would never have been heard of again. On the fourteenth of June,
forty-seven days after the mutiny, they reached the Dutch
settlement at Coupang Bay, on the island of Timor, a distance of
more than twelve hundred leagues from Tofoa. After recuperating for
two months among the kindly inhabitants of Coupang, a small
schooner was purchased and fitted out for the voyage to Batavia,
where they arrived on October I, 1789. Here three more of the party
died: Elphinstone, Lenkletter, the remaining quartermaster, and
Thomas Hall, a seaman. Ledward, the acting surgeon, was left behind
at Batavia, and the rest of the party embarked in ships of the
Dutch East India Company for the voyage home. Robert Lamb, the
butcher, died on the passage, leaving but twelve of the nineteen
men who had set out from the <i>Bounty's</i> side.</p>

<p>"In all the annals of our maritime history there has never been
such an open-boat voyage as this," Dr. Hamilton continued. "You
will understand the excitement and interest aroused when Bligh
reached England. I was then in London, and for weeks the story of
the mutiny and the voyage of the launch were the chief topics of
conversation everywhere. The whole country rang with Bligh's
praises, and the sympathy for him is universal. It would be useless
to deny the fact, Mr. Byam&mdash;those who remained in the
<i>Bounty</i> are all considered scoundrels of the blackest
description."</p>

<p>"But did Captain Bligh say nothing," I asked, "of the men who
were kept against their inclination? I fully understand, now, his
bitterness toward me, but there are others whom he knows to be
innocent, and he pledged himself to do them justice if ever he
reached England. Stewart and Coleman are in irons at this moment,
as you may know. They are as guiltless as any of those who went
with Captain Bligh."</p>

<p>"I have read the instructions furnished to Captain Edwards by
the Admiralty," he replied. "They contain a list of the names of
those who remained in the <i>Bounty</i>, and you are all considered
mutineers. No distinction is made amongst you, and Captain Edwards
is instructed to keep you so closely confined as to preclude all
possibility of escape."</p>

<p>"Does this mean that we shall be confined where we are now until
the <i>Pandora</i> reaches England?"</p>

<p>"Not if Captain Edwards will follow my advice. His instructions
also say that, in confining you, he is to have a proper regard for
the preservation of your lives. In this matter I am equally
responsible with him, and I would not answer for the life of a pig
kept for months on end on the orlop deck. I shall do my best to
persuade him to remove you to more healthful quarters."</p>

<p>"And if possible, sir," I urged, "persuade him to permit us to
speak with one another."</p>

<p>"God bless my soul! Do you tell me that he has denied you that
small privilege?" The surgeon regarded me with a grim smile.
"Captain Edwards is a just man, Mr. Byam. You will understand,
perhaps, what I mean by this? He will carry out his instructions to
the letter, and if ever he errs, it will not be on the side of
leniency. But I think that I can promise you relief in some small
matters. At any rate, be assured that I shall try. To return to the
matter of your studies: you have your manuscripts at your house, I
presume?"</p>

<p>All of my personal belongings had been left at Tautira. I told
the surgeon of my friend, Tuahu, and that, if I might send him
word, he would bring my chest to the ship. Dr. Hamilton asked that
I write his name on a slip of paper.</p>

<p>"I will find him," he said. "Sir Joseph is extremely anxious
that these manuscripts of yours should not be lost."</p>

<p>"It would be a godsend to me, sir, if I might continue my work
on the voyage home."</p>

<p>"Sir Joseph had requested this very thing, in case you should be
found," the surgeon replied. "Captain Edwards will, I believe,
grant permission."</p>

<p>This news cheered me greatly. I should have an occupation that
would suffice to make the long confinement endurable, and as
Stewart, Coleman, and Skinner were all proficient in the Indian
tongue, if we were permitted to converse my studies could be
carried on with their help.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton glanced at his timepiece.</p>

<p>"I must send you below soon," he said. "I had Captain Edwards's
consent to this interview that I might question you with respect to
the manuscripts. He is ashore this morning. I have taken advantage
of the fact to enlarge upon my privilege."</p>

<p>He rose, unlocked the door of his cabin, glanced out, and closed
it again.</p>

<p>"I shall enlarge upon it still more," he said. "Sir Joseph has
charged me with another commission. In case you could be found, he
asked me to deliver this letter to you."</p>

<p>Dr. Hamilton busied himself with some papers of his own while I
read my letter. It was from my mother, of course. I still have it
to this day, but I need not consult it to refresh my memory. For
all the years that have passed, I can recall it, word for
word:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>MY DEAR SON:<br>
<br>

<p>I have only just learned that I may have this precious
opportunity to write to you. I must make every moment count, and
waste none in unnecessary words.<br>
<br></p>

<p>When Captain Bligh returned with the news of the dreadful fate
of the <i>Bounty</i>, I wrote to him at once, and received from him
the letter which I enclose. What may have happened to turn him
against you, I cannot conceive. After the receipt of so cruel a
message I did not again write to him, but you must not believe that
I have been greatly distressed. I know you too well, dear Roger, to
have the least doubt of your innocence.<br>
<br></p>

<p>I know what your anxiety, on my account, will be upon the
arrival of the <i>Pandora</i>, when you learn that you are counted
among the mutineers. Imagine then, dear son, that you have been
able to write to me, explaining fully the circumstances, and
imagine that your letter has reached me. I am as certain as though
I had this letter before me that events over which you had no
control caused you to remain in the <i>Bounty</i>, and I await with
perfect confidence your homecoming and the clearing of your name
from this infamous charge.<br>
<br></p>

<p>My only concern for you is at the thought of the hardships you
may have to suffer as a prisoner on the long voyage to England. But
they can be borne, and remember, my son, that home is beyond
them.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Sir Joseph has talked with Captain Bligh, and you will be
gratified to know that he does not share Mr. Bligh's belief that
you were one of his enemies. I have not been told upon what ground
you are charged with conspiracy, but in closing his letter to me,
Sir Joseph said: 'I confidently expect that the proof of your son's
innocence only awaits the day when the <i>Pandora</i> returns and
all the facts shall be known.' I not only expect it. I am as sure
of it as I am of the light of to-morrow's sun.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Good-bye, my dear Roger. I may not write more. The
<i>Pandora</i> is to sail within three or four days, and my letter
must go to London by this night's coach. God bless you, my son, and
bring you safely home! Believe me, my dear boy, I can smile at the
thought of the preposterous charge against you. May England breed
many such villains as you are supposed to be.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Hamilton was kindness itself. Our quarters on the orlop deck
were as dark as a cave and I could never have read my letter there.
He permitted me to go over it again and again in his cabin until I
knew it by heart. The enclosed letter from Bligh to my mother was,
surely, the most cruel and heartless message that has ever been
sent to the mother of an absent son:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>LONDON, April 2nd, 1790.<br>
<br>

<p>MADAME:<br>
<br></p>

<p>I received your letter this day, and feel for you very much,
being perfectly sensible of the extreme distress you must suffer
from the conduct of your son, Roger Byam. His baseness is beyond
all description, but I hope you will endeavour to prevent the loss
of him, heavy as the misfortune is, from affecting you too
severely. I imagine he is, with the rest of the mutineers, returned
to Otaheite.<br>
<br></p>

<p>I am, Madame,<br>
<br></p>

<p>WILLIAM BLIGH.</p></blockquote>

<p>I returned to our dark hole in a vastly different frame of mind
than when I left it. As we passed along the lower deck I caught
glimpses through the scuttles of the Matavai beach, and the canoes
and the boats from the frigate plying back and forth between the
ship and the shore. Those brief bright glimpses brought home to me
the preciousness of freedom, the inestimable boon of being merely
alive and at liberty. I made no attempt to compute the length of
time that must pass before it could be mine again.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c16" id="c16"></a>CHAPTER XVI.&mdash;THE
ROUNDHOUSE</h2>

<p>The following morning our prison was cleaned for the first time
since we had been confined there, and lighted with two additional
candles. A bucket of sea water was then furnished us and we were
permitted to wash our hands and faces. We were in a truly
deplorable condition, only less filthy than the prison itself, and
we begged the master-at-arms to allow us a complete bath.</p>

<p>"I have been ordered to give you one bucket of water and no
more," he said. "Make haste, for the captain is coming
directly."</p>

<p>We had no sooner finished our hurried toilet than Captain
Edwards entered, followed by Lieutenant Parkin. The master-at-arms
called out, "Prisoners! Stand!" We rose to our feet, and Edwards
glanced around the compartment and from one to another of us. The
stench of the place was frightful, and our naked bodies gleamed
with sweat in the dim light. From the appearance of my fellow
prisoners I knew what a disgusting appearance I myself must
present. My intention had been to protest against the inhumanity of
such a place of confinement; but believing that conditions would
speak eloquently enough for themselves, I decided to say nothing.
Edwards turned to the master-at-arms.</p>

<p>"Command them to hold out their hands," he said.</p>

<p>"Prisoners, hold out your hands!"</p>

<p>We obeyed, and Edwards examined our handcuffs and leg irons. It
chanced that Stewart's manacles fitted somewhat loosely to his
wrists, and Edwards noticed this.</p>

<p>"Mr. Parkin, see to it that the armourer inspects all of these
irons," he said. "I shall hold him responsible if any prisoner
shall be able to free himself."</p>

<p>"I shall attend to the matter immediately, sir," Parkin
replied.</p>

<p>Edwards continued to regard us coldly for a moment or two.</p>

<p>"Inform the prisoners that, in future, they may converse with
one another. But let them understand this: they shall speak only in
English. If I hear of as much as a single word passing between them
in the Indian language, the permission I have granted shall be
withdrawn."</p>

<p>This information was conveyed to us through the proper
channel.</p>

<p>"And under no circumstances whatever is any prisoner to speak to
a sentinel or to any member of the ship's company except Mr. Parkin
or the corporal in charge of the guard. I shall severely punish any
infringement of this order."</p>

<p>Parkin was in general charge of us. I felt an instinctive
aversion for this man. He was short, thickset, and excessively
hairy, with eyebrows that met in an irregular line over his nose.
The vice of cruelty was written plain on his face, and we had not
been long in discovering the character of the man in whose power we
were. Thus far he had displayed it in various small ways, but
Edwards had now given him the kind of opportunity he craved. No
sooner had the captain left us than Parkin himself made an
inspection of our irons, beginning with Stewart, whom he ordered to
lie down and stretch up his hands. He then grasped the chain
connecting the handcuffs, and, placing his foot against Stewart's
chest, he strained and tugged with all his strength, succeeding at
length in wrenching off the irons, taking the skin from Stewart's
knuckles and the backs of both hands as he did so. As the handcuffs
came away he nearly fell over backward. In his anger, Stewart
forgot his helpless position. He sprang to his feet, and had Parkin
been within reach Stewart would have knocked him down.</p>

<p>"You filthy beast!" he said. "Do you call yourself an
officer?"</p>

<p>Parkin had a high soft voice, almost feminine in quality, in
strange contrast to his swarthy, hairy appearance.</p>

<p>"What did you say?" he asked. "Repeat that."</p>

<p>"I called you a filthy beast," said Stewart, "and so you
are!"</p>

<p>He was as near to Parkin as his irons would permit him to go.
The lieutenant took care to keep beyond reach.</p>

<p>"You will regret that," he said. "I promise that you will repent
of it more than once before you're hung."</p>

<p>I am unable to say whether he would have tried the irons of the
rest of us in the same manner. I was resolved that he should not
test mine in that fashion; but at that moment the armourer appeared
and Parkin ordered him to carry on the examination. It would have
been impossible for any of us to have freed ourselves from the leg
irons, but Parkin ordered all the handcuffs to be altered so that
they should fit more tightly. When they had been repaired and
brought back, it was only with great difficulty that they could be
fastened upon us.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I told the others of my conversation with the
surgeon. We forgot our wretched situation in the pleasure of being
permitted to converse again, and the day passed more rapidly than
the previous five had done. Realizing now that we had nothing to
hope for until we reached England, we resolved to make the best of
things, and to devise methods of passing the time. Of the four of
us, Skinner alone had nothing to hope for, and yet he was the most
cheerful of us all. I began to suspect, at this time, that the man
was not wholly right in his mind. He said more than once that, if
the decision were again to be made, he would give himself up to
justice as he had done, and he seemed to look forward with pleasure
to the day when he would be hung.</p>

<p>We were careful to obey Edwards's order with respect to the
sentinels. We had no desire to make trouble for them, and Parkin
was spying about at all hours. But there was a seaman, James Good,
whose name was an indication of his kindly nature. He was the man
usually sent with our food, and he never failed to whisper to us
welcome bits of news as he handed round our plates. "Mr. Parkin's
gone ashore, sir," he would say; "you won't be bothered this
morning." Or, "I'll fetch you a bit of fresh meat for your supper."
Whenever possible he would bring us morsels of fresh pork or
breadfruit or sweet potatoes wrapped in a handkerchief inside his
blouse. This he did with the connivance of the cooks. Had any of
these men been discovered, they would have been severely flogged,
and yet they cheerfully ran the risk in order to lighten the misery
of our situation.</p>

<p>But never had Good brought us such welcome news as on the
evening when he informed us that we were to be moved to other
quarters.</p>

<p>"Have you heard the knockin' and 'ammerin' on deck, sir?" he
whispered to me. "The carpenters are makin' a proper 'ouse for you
up there."</p>

<p>We had heard, at times, the sounds of hammering, and now that we
knew it concerned us, it was music to our ears. The following day
we were unshackled from the filthy planking of our dungeon, marched
up the ladderway, along the lower deck, and up a second ladderway
to the pure air of the upper deck. At first our eyes were so
dazzled by the brilliance of the sunshine that we could scarcely
see, and so lost half the pleasure of our moment in the open. It
was, in fact, no more than a moment. Edwards was present, and the
master-at-arms ordered us into our new prison at once. We mounted
the ladder to the top of the box, which stood on the quarter-deck.
There was a scuttle about eighteen inches square through which we
descended inside.</p>

<p>This place was to be our prison for as long as we remained on
the <i>Pandora</i>. It was called "the roundhouse," but more often
we prisoners referred to it as "Pandora's Box." It was eleven feet
long at the deck and eighteen feet wide at the bulkhead. There were
two scuttles, nine inches square, in the bulkhead, and these, with
the one in the roof, were heavily barred and gave us what light we
had. Across the deck midway between the walls was a line of
fourteen heavy ringbolts to which the leg irons were to be
attached. We were now made fast in the corners of the compartment,
Stewart and Skinner next the bulkhead, and Coleman and I on the
after side. Our leg irons were cylindrical bands three inches wide
with a twelve-inch length of chain which passed through a ringbolt.
One key unlocked all the leg irons and another the handcuffs. The
keys were carried by the master-at-arms.</p>

<p>As in our former prison, we could stand up and move half a pace
in either direction, and we had full headroom. The floor was the
deck itself, and on either side were small scupper holes. In fair
weather the roof scuttle was left open save for the iron grating,
and two sentries continually paced the roof. The monotonous,
everlasting tread of their feet so close overhead became a sound as
wearisome to us as the clinking of our chains through the
ringbolts.</p>

<p>We could not suppose that so large a prison had been prepared
for four men, and by each of the unoccupied ringbolts lay a pair of
leg irons ready for use. Evidently Captain Edwards had reason to
believe that he would soon take others of the <i>Bounty's</i>
company. That Christian and his party had returned was so
improbable as not to be worth considering. The only remaining
possibility was that the departure of the <i>Resolution</i> from
Papara had been delayed, and that she was either captured or about
to be. We were not long kept in doubt. Two days later, the grating
over the roof scuttle was raised, and Morrison, Norman, and Ellison
were brought down and chained beside us.</p>

<p>This was a meeting such as none of us had hoped for. Morrison
and Norman had not yet recovered from their astonishment at being
treated as pirates. Ellison was the same scatter-brained youngster
he had always been. Excitement in any form was the breath of life
to him, and to be considered a desperate character, chained up like
a wild beast, was his conception of a lark. Fortunately he had no
sense of the gravity of his situation, and we did nothing to remind
him of it. Of all those who had taken part in the mutiny, he was
the one I most hoped would escape capture.</p>

<p>The armourer, supervised by Parkin, fitted handcuffs to the new
captives, and Ellison being no more than a boy, Parkin tried upon
him the same measures he had used with Stewart. Ordering him to lie
down, he placed one foot on his chest and tried to draw the
handcuffs over his hands. For a moment Ellison endured this
treatment in silence; then he said, smiling, "Leave off, sir. I'll
give you these things if you want them, but you can't get them that
way."</p>

<p>Parkin's only reply was to let go the chain so suddenly that
Ellison fell back, striking his head heavily on the deck. Parkin's
eyes shone with delight as Ellison sat up, rubbing his head. He
ordered him to stretch up his hands again, but this time Ellison
was prepared, and when Parkin let go the chain the boy fell back on
one shoulder and avoided striking his head.</p>

<p>"That's one for me, sir," he said with a grin.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was breathing heavily, not so much from exertion
as from emotion. The fact that a common seaman and a mutineer
beside had dared to speak to him was more than he could endure.</p>

<p>"Lie down!" he ordered.</p>

<p>A look of fear came into Ellison's eyes as he obeyed. He
stretched up his arms, expecting Parkin to grasp the chain again.
Instead of that he kicked Ellison in the side, as cruel a blow as
was ever given a defenseless man.</p>

<p>"That will teach you how to speak to an officer," he said, in
his soft bland voice. The armourer was a witness of this foul
proceeding. "Good God, sir!" he exclaimed in spite of himself. By a
happy chance Parkin stood within reach of Morrison, who drew back
his manacled fists and gave him a blow which sent him staggering in
my direction. I had barely time to fetch him another that knocked
him off his balance, and as he fell he struck his head against one
of the ringbolts. He got up slowly and looked from one to another
of us without speaking. Presently he turned to the armourer.</p>

<p>"You may go, Jackson," he said. "I shall know how to deal with
this." The armourer went up the ladder, and Parkin stood looking
down at Ellison, who was lying on his belly with his hands pressed
against his side.</p>

<p>"Oh, you dogs!" he exclaimed softly, as though speaking to
himself. "I could have you flogged to death for this. But I'm to
see you hung! Remember that&mdash;I'm to see you hung!" He then
went up the ladder, the grating was lifted for him, and he climbed
out.</p>

<p>Had not the armourer witnessed the brutal assault upon Ellison,
I have no doubt that we should have suffered for our rebellious
conduct. But evidently Parkin feared that the truth would come out
if complaint should be made to the captain. At any rate, no action
was taken, and for several days we saw no more of the man. Ellison
suffered great pain, but youth and natural toughness of body were
in his favour, and he quickly recovered.</p>

<p>As soon as we were alone again, Morrison gave us an account of
the taking of the schooner. Having called at Papara to pick up
McIntosh, Hillbrandt, and Millward, they had decided to take
advantage of the fine weather to salt down some extra casks of
pork. Several days were spent in this work, and on the morning of
what was to have been their last day on the island, most of the men
made an excursion far up the Papara Valley for a supply of mountain
plantains. Morrison, Ellison, and Norman remained with the
schooner, and toward noon word reached the district of the arrival
of a vessel at Matavai. Before any action could be taken, a ship's
launch filled with marines appeared.</p>

<p>"Norman and I could have danced for joy at sight of the English
uniforms," Morrison went on; "but when we thought of the others we
felt less happy. They were certain of capture now and I had no time
to send them warning. The launch was upon us five minutes after she
had rounded the point. She came alongside and you can imagine our
astonishment when we saw that Thomas Hayward, in a lieutenant's
uniform, was in charge of her."</p>

<p>"I suppose you fell on each other's necks, Morrison," Stewart
put in. "He didn't condescend to speak to me, but ordered his men
to clap me in irons. He remained with the schooner with most of the
marines. We were sent back with the launch."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hayward is in a difficult position; we must remember that,"
said Coleman.</p>

<p>"In a position that precisely suits the little cad," said
Stewart, hotly. "He knows that we are as innocent as he
himself."</p>

<p>"Do you remember how he whimpered when Christian ordered him
into the launch?" asked Morrison.</p>

<p>"So he did, Coleman," said Norman. "Him and Mr. Hallet both
begged to stay with the ship, and that's something none of us was
guilty of."</p>

<p>Hayward's superior, contemptuous attitude was naturally resented
by all of us who had taken no part in the mutiny. Making all
possible allowances for him, we still found it inexcusable.</p>

<p>The other men were soon brought in from Papara. There were seven
of them: McIntosh, Hillbrandt, Burkitt, Millward, Sumner, Muspratt,
and Byrne. The roundhouse was none too large, now, for our
accommodation. Eight men were chained so that they slept with their
heads at the bulkhead, and six on the opposite side. I was in the
corner, on the starboard side aft, with Muspratt on my left. I had
reason to be grateful for my chance position in the roundhouse. Two
or three days after we had been confined there, I discovered in one
of the wall planks a knot that had become loosened as the green
lumber dried in the sun. I tried for several nights, without
success, to draw it out. James Good, our steward, came to my
assistance. He pushed the knot in to me, and thereafter I had a
tiny window through which I had a glimpse of the bay and the shore
line beyond. Sometimes, as the <i>Pandora</i> shifted her position
with the current, I had Stewart's house directly opposite my
window, and although we were too far distant to enable me to
distinguish the people moving about there, I could easily imagine
who they were.</p>

<p>I watched canoes and the ship's boats coming and going. Many of
the people in the canoes I knew; they were old friends of one or
another of us. As they approached, I could see them more and more
distinctly until they were cut off from view by the side of the
vessel. Several times I saw Peggy, Stewart's wife, being paddled
around the ship by her father or one of her brothers. With what
longing she gazed in our direction! Her father, wisely, never
brought her within earshot. She would have been certain to cry out
to her husband had she thought him within hearing, only adding to
the misery of them both. I said nothing to Stewart of the matter. I
had no desire to harrow his feelings any more than was already the
case with him.</p>

<p>One morning while I was standing on lookout, Muspratt, who was
keeping watch for me, gave the warning, "Hatchway!" and I had
barely time to thrust in the knot before the master-at-arms
descended the ladder, followed by Edwards. It was an unexpected
visit, the first we had had from the captain since our confinement
in the roundhouse. Our prison had not been cleaned in all that
time, and I will say no more of its condition than that fourteen
chained men were obliged to obey the calls of nature in that
close-walled space.</p>

<p>Edwards halted at the foot of the ladder.</p>

<p>"Master-at-arms, why is this place in such a filthy state?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Parkin's orders were that it was to be cleaned once a week,
sir."</p>

<p>"Have it washed out immediately, and report to me when it is
done."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>Edwards lost no time in leaving the place; then, to our great
joy, swabs were handed down to us, and bucket after bucket of salt
water. When we had scoured our quarters thoroughly, passing the
swabs from hand to hand, we scrubbed each other. To be clean once
more had a wonderful effect upon our spirits. Some of the men sang
and whistled at the work, sounds that contrasted strangely with the
clinking of manacles, but these cheerful noises were cut short by a
curt order from the master-at-arms. In half an hour we had the
place as clean as salt water and good will could make it, whereupon
the master-at-arms returned, followed, this time, by Dr. Hamilton.
The surgeon threw a quick glance in my direction, and there was a
friendly glint in his eyes; otherwise he gave no indication that we
had met before. He passed along the line, glancing over our bodies
in a professional manner, and stopped before Muspratt.</p>

<p>"That needs attention, my man," he said, indicating a great boil
on Muspratt's knee. "Have him sent to the sick-bay at ten, Mr.
Jackson."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Dr. Hamilton had fully as much dignity as the captain, but he
did not feel it necessary to address us through an inferior
officer.</p>

<p>"Are any of the rest of you suffering from boils or other
humours?" he asked. "If so, speak up, and I'll attend to you at the
same time. Remember, it is my duty to care for your health as well
as that of the ship's company. You must not hesitate to inform me
when you need my services."</p>

<p>"May I speak, sir?" Stewart asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Would it be possible, while the ship remains here, for us to be
supplied now and then with fresh food?"</p>

<p>Morrison eagerly seconded this request.</p>

<p>"We have friends among the Indians, sir, who would be only too
glad to send us fruit and cooked vegetables if this could be
permitted."</p>

<p>"And it would save the ship's stores, sir," Coleman added. Dr.
Hamilton glanced from one to another of us.</p>

<p>"But you're having fresh food," he said.</p>

<p>"No, sir, begging your pardon," said Coleman. "Only salt beef
and hard bread."</p>

<p>Dr. Hamilton looked at the master-at-arms.</p>

<p>"That's been their victuals, sir. Mr. Parkin's orders."</p>

<p>"I see," the surgeon replied. "I'll look into the matter.
Perhaps it can be arranged."</p>

<p>We thanked him warmly, and he went on deck again.</p>

<p>It was plain from the events of that morning that Parkin's
treatment of us had been without the knowledge of the captain or of
Dr. Hamilton. Edwards was willing to be ignorant of the
lieutenant's cruelty, but from that day forth Dr. Hamilton made us
frequent visits. We were never again compelled to lie in our own
filth, and our food was the same as that given to the seamen of the
<i>Pandora</i>.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c17" id="c17"></a>CHAPTER XVII.&mdash;THE SEARCH FOR
THE <i>BOUNTY</i></h2>

<p>One morning early in May, Stewart and I were freed from our leg
irons and conducted to the place used as the sick-bay on the lower
deck. We found Dr. Hamilton awaiting us in the passageway outside.
He said nothing, but motioned us to enter. We went in, not knowing
what to expect, and the door was closed behind us. Tehani and Peggy
were there, with our little daughters.</p>

<p>Tehani came close and put her arms around me, speaking in a low
voice directly into my ear, lest she should be heard by those
outside. "Listen, Byam. I have no time for weeping. I must speak
quickly. Atuanui is here with three hundred Tautira men, his best
warriors. They have been coming around the coast from both sides,
five or ten each time. For many days I have been trying to see you.
There was no chance. At last it comes. They will attack the ship at
night. In the darkness the great guns will do us little harm. What
we fear is that you may be killed by the soldiers before we can
reach you. That is why the attack has not yet been made. Are you
all in the house they have built on the deck? Are you chained?
Atuanui wishes to know how you are guarded there."</p>

<p>I was so overcome with joy at seeing Tehani and our little
daughter that I was unable to speak for a moment.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Byam, quickly! We shall not have long to speak."</p>

<p>"How long have you been at Matavai, Tehani?"</p>

<p>"Three days after you left Tautira, I came. Did you think I
would desert you? It is Atuanui and I who have made this plan. All
of your friends are eager to attack."</p>

<p>"Tehani," I said, "you must tell Atuanui that there is no chance
to save us. He and all of his men would be killed."</p>

<p>"No, no, Byam! We will club them to death before they can use
their guns. We will save you from these evil men. Atuanui wishes to
attack to-morrow night. There is no moon. It must be done quickly,
for the ship is soon to go."</p>

<p>It was useless trying to explain to Tehani the reason for our
imprisonment. She could not understand; and, indeed, we had only
ourselves to blame, for, as already related, the fact of the mutiny
had been kept a secret from all the Tahitians.</p>

<p>"We know. That captain, Etuati, has told Hitihiti that you are
bad men. He says he must take you to England to be punished.
Hitihiti does not believe this. No one believes it."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Stewart's wife had told him what Tehani had told me.
There was but one way of preventing an attack upon the frigate. We
explained that all of the prisoners were chained, hand and foot;
that we were entirely helpless and would undoubtedly be killed
before the ship could be taken. I told Tehani, which was true, that
Captain Edwards was prepared for such an attack, and our guards
under orders to shoot us at the first sign of any attempt at rescue
on the part of our friends on shore. We succeeded at last in
convincing our wives of the hopelessness of the plan.</p>

<p>Until this moment Tehani and Peggy had kept their emotions under
control. Realizing now that nothing could be done, Peggy broke down
in a flood of passionate weeping heart-rending to see. Stewart
tried in vain to comfort her. Tehani sat on the floor at my feet,
her head buried in her arms, making no sound. Had she wept I would
have been better able to bear it. I knelt beside her with our child
in my arms. For the first time in my life I tasted to the full the
bitterness of true misery.</p>

<p>Presently Stewart could endure no more. He opened the door. Dr.
Hamilton and the guards were waiting outside. He motioned them to
come in. Peggy clung to him desperately, and it was only with the
greatest difficulty that he could disengage her fingers. Had it not
been for Tehani she would have had to be carried from the ship.
Tehani's grief was beyond tears, as mine was. We held each other
close, for a moment, without speaking. Then she lifted up Peggy,
and supported her as we went out. Stewart and I followed, carrying
our children. At the gangway we gave them to the servants who had
come with our wives. Stewart begged to be taken to the roundhouse
at once. I was conducted to Dr. Hamilton's cabin and was deeply
grateful for the privilege he gave me of being alone there for a
few moments. Through the port I saw the canoe, with my friend Tuahu
and Tipau, Peggy's father, at the paddles, leave the side of the
ship. One of the servants held Peggy's child. Tehani sat on a
thwart in the bow, holding our little Helen in her arms. I watched
the canoe growing smaller and smaller, with such despair in my
heart as I had never known till then.</p>

<p>I was still standing at the port when Dr. Hamilton entered.</p>

<p>"Sit down, my boy," he said. His eyes were moist as he looked at
me. "I persuaded Captain Edwards to consent to this meeting. My
intentions were of the best, but I didn't realize how cruel a trial
it would be for all of you."</p>

<p>"I can speak for Stewart as well as for myself, sir. We are
deeply grateful to you."</p>

<p>"Would you mind telling me your wife's name?"</p>

<p>"Tehani. She is the niece of Vehiatua, the chief of
Taiarapu."</p>

<p>"She is a noble woman, Mr. Byam. I was greatly impressed by her
dignity and poise. I don't mind confessing that my ideas of the
Indian women have altered greatly, now that I have seen them. My
conception had been gained from the stories about them that
circulate in England. I had supposed them all wanton little
creatures without character or depth of feeling. I see more clearly
every day how mistaken this conception was. We call these people
savages! I realize now that in many respects we are the savages,
not they."</p>

<p>"You have not seen my wife before?" I asked.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I have seen her every day this past month. She
has been moving heaven and earth in her attempts to see you.
Stewart's wife has been doing the same. Until yesterday, Captain
Edwards refused all requests of the Indians for permission to visit
the prisoners. He fears that they may attempt to rescue you."</p>

<p>"He has reason to fear it, sir."</p>

<p>"Reason to fear it? How is that?"</p>

<p>I would gladly have avoided speaking of what Tehani had told me,
and could I have been certain that Atuanui would abandon his plan,
I would have said nothing. But I knew his fearless impetuous
nature, and neither he nor Tehani had any conception of the
murderous effect of great guns loaded with grape. They had never
seen them fired, and it was more than possible that Atuanui might
yet be persuaded of the feasibility of his plan. Therefore I told
the surgeon of the plan to attack the frigate, and of what I had
done to prevent its being carried out. He was astonished at the
news.</p>

<p>"We have had no suspicion that anything of the sort was afoot,"
he said. "You have done well to tell me of this. An attack would
mean the death of scores, if not hundreds, of the Indians."</p>

<p>"Captain Edwards can easily avoid all danger," I said. "He will
have only to keep a strong guard on shore and to prohibit any
gathering of canoes near the ship."</p>

<p>The surgeon then told me that he had received from Tuahu the
manuscripts of my dictionary and grammar.</p>

<p>"I have your private Journal as well," he added. "Would you
permit me to look into this latter sometime, or does it contain
matters which you wish no one to see?"</p>

<p>I told him that it contained nothing but a day-to-day account of
my experiences from the time of leaving England until the arrival
of the <i>Pandora</i>, which he was welcome to read, if he
chose.</p>

<p>"I shall appreciate that privilege," he replied. "Your Journal
will be of great value to you in later years. If you like, I will
take care of all these papers for you. They can go into the bottom
of my small medicine chest, and there they will be certain of
reaching England safely. With respect to the dictionary, Captain
Edwards knows of the great interest Sir Joseph Banks takes in it,
and you are to be permitted to work on it during the passage
home."</p>

<p>This was a welcome assurance indeed. I had looked forward with
dread to our long voyage. I now mentioned the captain's prohibition
against our speaking in Tahitian among ourselves. "If this could be
removed, sir, I could be given much help by the other prisoners,
and perform a service to them at the same time, by giving them
something to occupy their minds."</p>

<p>The surgeon promised to intercede with the captain on this
account, and as soon as the <i>Pandora</i> sailed the permission
was granted.</p>

<p>All the next day the ship's boats were kept busy bringing off
provisions, and the tents and implements of the carpenters and
armourers which had been set up on the beach near our anchorage.
Our steward, James Good, told us that the frigate was to sail
within twenty-four hours. Edwards had gained no information with
respect to Christian and the <i>Bounty</i>, and apparently had come
to the conclusion that we had told the truth in saying that we knew
nothing of Christian's possible destination. All that day I gazed
my fill at the green land where I had been so happy, and during the
night I heard every bell strike, followed by the clear calls of the
sentinels in various parts of the ship. Fortunately, no attempt was
made to seize the frigate. At dawn we were under way. At ten
o'clock, looking from my knot-hole window, I saw nothing but empty
sea.</p>

<p>There followed a weary time for the fourteen men confined in
"Pandora's Box." My dictionary proved a blessing to nearly all of
us. On our second day at sea it was brought to me by Dr. Hamilton
himself, together with writing materials, and the surgeon had had
the carpenter make me a small table which rested on the floor
across my lap as I sat in my corner. The green island timber of
which the roundhouse had been made was beginning to shrink in the
hot sun, and sufficient light streamed through the cracks between
the planks to enable me to write without straining my eyes greatly.
The prohibition against speaking in the Indian tongue was lifted,
and the other men entered with pleasure into my studies. Stewart,
Morrison, and Ellison were accomplished linguists, only a little
less proficient in Tahitian than in English. Ellison surprised me.
He spoke the language with a purer accent than any of us, and
seemed to have absorbed his knowledge of it without the least
effort. He pointed out many fine distinctions between words that
had escaped me. This poor lad had never known who his parents were.
He had been kicked from larboard to starboard ever since he could
remember, and it had never occurred to him that he had a good mind.
It saddened me to think that such a youngster, with an excellent
capacity for education, had received none, while many a dull-witted
son of wealthy parents was offered advantages he was not equipped
to profit by.</p>

<p>There were grey days of continual violent squalls when it was
impossible to work on the dictionary. The frigate laboured heavily
through the seas, rolling and pitching, and we rolled with her,
each man clinging to his ringbolt in an attempt to maintain his
position. Often we were thrown to the extent of our chains, and our
wrists and ankles were terribly galled by the bands of iron around
them. To add to our misery in seasons of bad weather, the rain
trickled down upon us day and night through the uncaulked seams in
the roof of our prison, and we slept, or, better, tried to sleep,
on boards slimy wet.</p>

<p>We had been several days at sea when we learned that the
<i>Pandora</i> was not alone on this voyage. She was accompanied by
the <i>Resolution</i>, the little schooner which Morrison and the
others had built. Edwards had fitted her out as a tender to the
frigate, and she was commanded by Mr. Oliver, the master's mate of
the <i>Pandora</i>, with a crew of a midshipman, a quartermaster,
and six seamen. She was a beautiful little craft and outsailed the
frigate in any kind of weather. Many and many a time poor Morrison,
and the men who were to have gone with him in the
<i>Resolution</i>, had occasion to lament their fate in being
captured at Papara. Whatever hardships they might have suffered
would have seemed light indeed compared with the misery of
existence in "Pandora's Box."</p>

<p>Henry Hillbrandt soon began to show signs of breaking under the
strain of confinement. By nature he was a man of brooding,
melancholy disposition, and it was evident that thoughts of the
court-martial ahead of us were preying upon his mind. I remember
well the evening when he first gave evidence of this. The sea was
dead calm, but a fine cold rain had been falling since morning, and
we were cold, wet, and miserable. It must have been toward midnight
that I was wakened from a doze by the sound of Hillbrandt's voice.
It was pitch-dark in the roundhouse. Hillbrandt was praying in low
monotonous tones that went on interminably. Seamen, however
irreverent some of them may be, invariably respect those of a
religious temperament, and rarely interfere with another man's
prayers. Although I could see nothing in the darkness, I knew that
the other men were awake, listening to Hillbrandt. He continued for
at least half an hour, praying God to save him from being hanged.
It was the same thing over and over again. At last I heard
Millward's voice: "Hillbrandt! For God's sake, <i>mamu!</i>" (Be
quiet!)</p>

<p>Hillbrandt broke off.</p>

<p>"Who was that? Was it you, Millward?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We want no more of your praying."</p>

<p>"No," someone else put in. "Pray to yourself if you must,
Hillbrandt, but give us a rest."</p>

<p>Of a sudden Hillbrandt broke out in a violent fit of sobbing.
"We're doomed, men," he said; "doomed, every one of us! We're to be
hanged, think of that! Choked to death at the end of a rope!"</p>

<p>"Damn your blood! Hold your tongue, will you?" I heard Burkitt
say. "Choke him off, Sumner, if he says another word!"</p>

<p>Sumner was chained next to Hillbrandt. "That I will!" he
replied. "I'll save the hangman one dirty job if he don't let
up!"</p>

<p>One topic, our possible fate when we reached England, was never
mentioned in the roundhouse. With the exception of Hillbrandt and
Skinner, present misery was enough for all of us, without
anticipating events to come.</p>

<p>The events of that dreary time are only less unpleasant to
recall than they were to endure. We had no knowledge of whither we
were bound, except that it was in the general direction of home.
James Good, our only source of information, told us that Captain
Edwards was making a zigzag course to westward, calling at every
island raised, in search of the <i>Bounty</i>. We had to form our
own conclusions as to where we were from the little I could see
through my knothole window. Some of the others could also see
something of what was taking place outside through the cracks that
began to appear in the walls as the planking shrunk under the
tropical sun. I kept a record of the days. We left Tahiti on May 9,
1791. On the nineteenth of May we sighted an island which all who
could view it recognized at once. It was Aitutaki, discovered by
Captain Bligh after the departure of the <i>Bounty</i> from Tahiti,
and shortly before the mutiny. There was great excitement in the
roundhouse that morning. The ship came close inshore and hove-to on
the larboard tack while the cutter was being lowered. We saw one of
the lieutenants and fifteen men go off in the boat.</p>

<p>"We'll have Christian and the others here before nightfall; I'll
venture my day's rations on it," said Coleman.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Coleman," said Stewart. "Christian would never be so
foolish as to choose any hiding-place known to Captain Bligh."</p>

<p>"What of Tupuai, Mr. Stewart?" Norman asked. "Christian would
have stayed there if the Indians had been friendly, and that island
was known to Captain Bligh."</p>

<p>"What do you think, Byam?" Stewart asked.</p>

<p>My opinion was, and Morrison and most of the others agreed, that
Christian would never again seek an asylum on a known island, more
particularly on any island that Bligh had visited. Nevertheless, we
waited with impatience for the return of the cutter. The frigate
stood off and on all day, and toward sunset we saw the cutter
putting off from shore. I had an excellent view of her as she
approached, and when I could say, with certainty, that none of
Christian's party was in her, Ellison gave a cheer, and clapped his
manacled hands together. We all felt as he did: we wanted Christian
and the men with him to escape. As soon as the cutter was hoisted
on board we stood out to sea, and that is the last we saw of
Aitutaki.</p>

<p>Every day or two, we had glimpses of the <i>Resolution</i> and
knew that she was following us from island to island. She came up
with us again when we were within sight of a low island, or atoll,
which consisted of a number of small islands connected by long
stretches of barren reef, the whole enclosing a lagoon of
considerable extent. We saw the schooner being revictualed from the
frigate, and then she stood in for shore with a cutter and one of
the yawls in tow. The schooner was proving of great service to
Edwards in his search. Owing to her light draft, she could examine,
close inshore, the various islands at which we touched. The
following day James Good brought us most interesting news. The
boats' crews had gone ashore at the atoll, and had discovered on
the beach of one of the islands a spar marked "<i>Bounty's</i>
Driver Gaff."</p>

<p>This discovery caused no less excitement in the roundhouse than
it did, presumably, in Captain Edwards's cabin. The captain
evidently considered the find as proof that the <i>Bounty</i> had
called at this island, or had passed near it. We knew better, but
we took good care to keep the information to ourselves. This driver
gaff was, unquestionably, one of the missing spars that had gone
adrift at Tupuai, and had been carried by winds and currents these
many miles to leeward.</p>

<p>During the next two months we cruised north and south among the
islands of the Union Group, the Navigator and the Friendly
Archipelagoes, still searching for some trace of the <i>Bounty</i>.
On the twenty-first of June, in a night of very thick weather, we
lost the <i>Resolution</i>. The frigate cruised about in that
vicinity for several days, but the schooner was seen no more,
whereupon Captain Edwards proceeded to Namuka, in the Friendly
Islands, the appointed place of rendezvous in case the vessels
should become separated. Namuka, it will be remembered, was the
island where the <i>Bounty</i> had put in for refreshment only a
few days before the mutiny. The <i>Pandora</i> anchored where the
<i>Bounty</i> had lain, and from my knot-hole I could see the
familiar scene: the scattered thatched houses of the Indians among
the groves, the watering place where the grapnel had been stolen,
and the same throngs of thieving savages crowding about the ship in
their canoes.</p>

<p>The <i>Pandora</i> remained here from July 28 until the second
of August, waiting for the <i>Resolution</i>, and during that time
the Indians proved as troublesome to the frigate's watering parties
as they had to those of the <i>Bounty</i>. The schooner having
failed to appear, she was given up as lost, and Captain Edwards now
decided to proceed on the homeward voyage without further loss of
time. Accordingly, we sailed from Namuka, and the following
afternoon passed within view of the island of Tofoa, and within a
few miles of the very spot where the mutiny had taken place so many
months before. The interest of the men in the roundhouse, as we
peered through the cracks at the blue outline of Tofoa, may be
imagined. To me, the events of that melancholy morning, and all
that had since passed, seemed unreal, and our present misfortunes
the experiences of a nightmare from which I should wake, presently,
to find myself still at home, in England. I had the strange feeling
that I had traveled backward in time and was living again through
the events of the night preceding the mutiny.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c18" id="c18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.&mdash;THE LAST OF THE
PANDORA</h2>

<p>I will pass briefly over the events of August. They were, no
doubt, interesting enough to the members of the <i>Pandora's</i>
company. To the prisoners in the roundhouse they passed with
interminable slowness. Islands were raised and left behind as we
proceeded toward Endeavour Straits. We were sailing much the same
course as that followed by Captain Bligh in his open-boat voyage to
Timor, and as we ploughed through that vast ocean scattered with
islands and shoals all but unknown to white men, I gained a truer
conception of the remarkable nature of Bligh's achievement. That he
should have succeeded in bringing seventeen men, without arms, and
so meagrely provided with food and water, through fair weather and
foul, to a destination nearly four thousand miles from his point of
departure seemed in the nature of a miracle. This achievement was
our principal topic of conversation in the roundhouse. Whatever our
personal feelings toward Bligh, there was not one of us who did not
feel proud, as Englishmen, of his voyage in the <i>Bounty's</i>
launch.</p>

<p>We saw little of Edwards. Three or four times, perhaps, in the
course of the voyage thus far, he had made an official inspection,
merely stopping at the foot of the ladder, glancing coldly from one
to another of us, and going out again. We were at the mercy of
Parkin, who made existence as wretched for us as he dared. As we
approached Endeavour Straits even Parkin ceased to visit us, this
duty being left to the master-at-arms. The lieutenants as well as
the captain himself were continually occupied with the navigation
of the ship. Every day one, and sometimes two, of the ship's boats
were sent out in advance of the frigate, for we had now reached the
northern extremity of the Great Barrier Reef which extends along
the eastern coast of Australia, as treacherous an extent of
shoal-infested ocean as any on the surface of the globe. Our course
was extremely tortuous, among reefs and sand-bars innumerable, and
all day long we could hear the calls of the men heaving the lead as
we worked our way slowly along. Not even the prisoners suffered
from boredom at this time. Those of us who could see something of
what was taking place outside kept constant watch, reporting to
others the dangers sighted or passed.</p>

<p>The twenty-eighth of August was a dismal day of alternate calms
and black squalls which greatly increased the dangers of
navigation. Looking from my knot-hole at dawn, I saw that we were
in the midst of a labyrinth of reefs and shoals upon which the sea
broke with great violence. The frigate had been hove-to during the
night, and now one of the boats, with Lieutenant Corner in command,
had gone ahead to seek for a possible passage. We could see little
of what was taking place, but the orders continually shouted from
the quarter-deck indicated only too clearly the difficulties in
which the ship found herself. Once, as we wore about, we passed
within half a cable's length of as villainous a reef as ever
brought a sailor's heart into his mouth.</p>

<p>So it went all that day, and as evening drew on it was apparent
that we were in greater danger than we had been at dawn. The launch
was still far in advance of us, and a gun was fired as a signal for
her to return. Darkness fell swiftly. False fires were burned and
muskets fired to indicate our position to the launch. The musket
fire was answered from the launch, and as the reports became more
distinct we knew that she was slowly approaching. All this while
the leadsmen were continually sounding, finding no bottom at one
hundred and ten fathoms; but soon we heard them calling depths
again: fifty fathoms, forty, thirty-six, twenty-two. Immediately
upon calling this latter depth the ship was put about, but before
the tacks were hauled on board and the sails trimmed, the frigate
struck, and every man in the roundhouse was thrown sprawling to the
length of his chain.</p>

<p>Before we could recover ourselves the ship struck again, with
such force that we thought the masts would come down. It was now
pitch-dark, and to make matters worse another heavy squall bore
down upon us. Above the roaring of the wind we could hear the
voices of the men, sounding faint and thin as orders were shouted.
Every effort was made to get the ship free by means of the sails,
but, this failing, they were furled and the other boats put over
the side for the purpose of carrying out an anchor. The squall
passed as suddenly as it had come, and we now heard distinctly the
musket shots of the men in the returning launch.</p>

<p>The violence of the shocks we had received left no doubt in our
minds that the ship had been badly damaged. I heard Edwards's
voice: "How does she do, Mr. Roberts?" and Roberts's reply: "She's
making water fast, sir. There's nearly three feet in the hold."</p>

<p>The effect upon the prisoners of this dreadful news may be
imagined. Hillbrandt and Michael Byrne began to cry aloud in
piteous voices, begging those outside to release us from our irons.
All our efforts to quiet them were useless, and the clamour they
made, with the tumult of shouting outside and the thunder of the
surf on the reef where we lay, added to the terror and gloom of the
situation.</p>

<p>Hands were immediately turned to the pumps, and orders were
given that other men should bail at the hatchways. Presently the
grating over the roundhouse scuttle was unlocked and the
master-at-arms entered with a lantern. He quickly unshackled
Coleman, Norman, and McIntosh, and ordered them on deck to lend a
hand. We begged the master-at-arms to release all of us, but he
gave no heed, and when he had gone out with the three men the iron
grating was replaced and locked as before.</p>

<p>Some of the prisoners now began to rave and curse like madmen,
wrenching at their chains in the vain effort to break them. At this
time Edwards appeared at the scuttle and sternly ordered us to be
silent.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, unshackle us, sir!" Muspratt called. "Give us a
chance for our lives!"</p>

<p>"Silence! Do you hear me?" Edwards replied; then, to the
master-at-arms, who stood beside him by the scuttle: "Mr. Jackson,
I hold you responsible for the prisoners. They are not to be loosed
without my orders."</p>

<p>"Let us bear a hand at the pumps, sir," Morrison called,
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Silence, you villains!" Edwards called, and with that he left
us.</p>

<p>Realizing now that pleading was useless, the men quieted down,
and we resigned ourselves to the situation in that mood of hopeless
apathy that comes over men powerless to help themselves. Within an
hour another tempest of wind and rain struck us, and again the
frigate was lifted by the seas and battered with awful violence on
the reef. These repeated shocks threw us from side to side and
against the walls and each other, so that we were dreadfully cut
and bruised. As nearly as we could judge, the ship was being
carried farther and farther across the reef. At length she lay
quiet, down by the head, and we heard Lieutenant Corner's voice:
"She's clear, sir!"</p>

<p>It must then have been about ten o'clock. The second squall had
passed, and in the silence that followed the screaming of the wind
we could plainly hear the orders being given. The guns were being
heaved over the side, and the men who could be spared from bailing
and pumping were employed in thrumbing a topsail to haul under the
ship's bottom, in an endeavor to fother her. But the leak gained so
fast that this plan had to be abandoned, and every man on board,
with the exception of our guards and ourselves, fell to bailing and
pumping.</p>

<p>Edwards's conduct toward us is neither to be explained nor
excused. The reef upon which the <i>Pandora</i> had struck was
leagues distant from any land, with the exception of a few small
sand-bars and stretches of barren rock. Had we been free, there
would have been no possibility of escape; and yet Edwards doubled
the guard over the roundhouse and gave orders to the master-at-arms
to keep us chained hand and foot. Fortunately, we did not realize
the imminence of our danger. The roundhouse being on the
quarter-deck, we were high above the water, and while we knew that
the ship was doomed, we did not know that the leak was gaining so
rapidly. It was, in fact, a race between the sea and daylight, and
had the frigate gone down in the night, every man on board of her
must have perished.</p>

<p>In the first grey light of dawn, we realized that the end was a
matter, not of hours, but of minutes. The frigate's stern was now
high out of water, and the pitch of the deck made it impossible to
stand. The boats were lying close by, and the officers were busy
getting supplies into them. In the forward part of the vessel the
water was fast approaching the gun-ports. Men swarmed on top of the
roundhouse and were going into the boats by the stern ladders. We
called to those outside, begging and pleading that we might not be
forgotten, and some of the men began wrenching at their leg irons
with the fury of despair. What the orders respecting us were, or
whether any had been given, I know not, but our entreaties must
have been heard by those outside. Joseph Hodges, the armourer's
mate, came down to us and removed the irons of Byrne, Muspratt, and
Skinner; but Skinner, in his eagerness to get out, was hauled up
with his handcuffs on, the two other men following close behind.
Then the scuttle was closed and barred again. This was done, I
believe, by the order of Lieutenant Parkin, for a moment before I
had seen him peering down at us.</p>

<p>Hodges had not noticed that the scuttle had been closed. He was
unlocking our irons as rapidly as possible when the ship gave a
lurch and there was a general cry of "There she goes!" Men were
leaping into the water from the stern, for the boats had pushed off
at the first appearance of motion in the ship. We shouted with all
our strength, for the water was beginning to flow in upon us. That
we were not all drowned was due to the humanity of James Moulter,
the boatswain's mate. He had scrambled up on the roof of the
roundhouse in order to leap into the sea, and, hearing our cries,
he replied that he would either set us free or go to the bottom
with us. He drew out the bars that fastened the scuttle to the
coamings, and heaved the scuttle overboard. "Hasten, lads!" he
cried, and then himself leaped into the sea.</p>

<p><a name="id07" id="id07"></a>In his excitement and fear, the
armourer's mate had neglected to remove the handcuffs of Burkitt
and Hillbrandt, although they were free of their leg irons. We
scrambled out, helping each other, and not a moment too soon. The
ship was under water as far as the mainmast, and I saw Captain
Edwards swimming toward the pinnace, which was at a considerable
distance. I leaped from the stern and had all I could do to clear
myself from the driver boom before the ship went down. I swam with
all my strength and was able to keep beyond the suction of the
water as the stern of the frigate rose perpendicularly and slid
into the sea. Few seamen know how to swim, and the cries of
drowning men were awful beyond the power of words to describe. All
hatch covers, spare booms, the coops for fowls, and the like, had
been cut loose, and some of the men had succeeded in reaching
floating articles; but others went down almost within reach of
planks or booms that might have saved them. I swam to one of the
hatch covers and found Muspratt at the other end. He was unable to
swim, but told me that he could hang on until he should be picked
up. I swam to a short plank, and, with this to buoy me, started in
the direction of one of the boats. I had been in the water nearly
an hour before I was taken up by the blue yawl. Of the prisoners,
Ellison and Byrne had been rescued by this boat, which was now
filled with men, and we set out for a small sandy key on the reef
at a distance of about three miles from where the ship went down.
This was the only bit of land above water anywhere about, although
there were shoals on every side near enough to the surface for the
sea to break over them.</p>

<p>There was quiet water at the key, which was nearly encircled by
reef, and we had no difficulty in landing. As soon as the men were
disembarked, with such provision as the boat contained, the yawl
was sent back to the scene of the wreck. Ellison, Byrne, and I were
kept at the oars, and Bowling, the master's mate, was at the
tiller. We made a wide search among floating wreckage, and so
strong were the currents thereabout that we took up men as far as
three miles from the reef where the ship had struck. We rescued
twelve in all, among them Burkitt, clinging to a spar with his
handcuffs still on his wrists. It was nearly midday before we
returned to the key, and by that time the other boats had assembled
there. The sand-bar, for it was no more than that, was about thirty
paces long by twenty wide. Nothing grew there&mdash;not a sprig of
green to relieve the eyes from the blinding glare of the sun.
Captain Edwards ordered a muster of the survivors, and it was found
that thirty-three of the ship's company and four of the prisoners
had been drowned. Of the prisoners, Stewart, Sumner, Hillbrandt,
and Skinner were missing.</p>

<p>Morrison told me that he had seen Stewart go down. He had not
been able to get clear of the ship as she foundered. A heavy spar
had shot up from the broken water, and as it fell Stewart was
struck on the head and sank instantly. Of all the events that had
happened since the <i>Bounty</i> left England, excepting only my
parting from my wife and little daughter, Stewart's death was the
one that cast the deepest gloom upon my spirit. A better companion
and a truer friend, in good fortune and bad, never lived.</p>

<p>Captain Edwards ordered tents to be erected with the sails from
the ship's boats, one for the officers and one for the men. We
prisoners were sent to the windward end of the sand-bar, and, as
there was no possibility of escape, we were not guarded in the
daytime; but two sentinels were placed over us at night, lest ten
of us should attack a ship's company nearly ten times our strength.
Nor were we permitted to speak to anyone save each other. During
our five months' confinement in the frigate, our bodies, which had
become inured to tropical sunlight at the time of our capture, had
bleached, and were almost as white as that of any counting-house
clerk in London. Most of us were stark naked, and our skin was soon
terribly blistered by the sun. We begged to be allowed to erect a
shelter for ourselves with one of the sails not in use, but Edwards
was so lacking in humanity as to refuse this request. Our only
recourse was to wet the burning sand at the water's edge and bury
ourselves in it up to the neck.</p>

<p>The suffering from thirst was scarcely to be endured. Nearly all
of us had swallowed quantities of salt water before we had been
rescued by the boats, which added to our torture. The provision
that had been saved was so scanty that each man's allowance on the
first day spent on the key was two musket-balls' weight of bread
and a gill of wine. No water was issued that day. Lieutenant Corner
made a fire with some bits of driftwood, placed a copper kettle
over it, and, by saving the drops of steam condensed in the cover,
got about a wineglass full of water, which was issued to the ship's
company, a teaspoonful per man, until the supply was exhausted. One
of the seamen, a man named Connell, went out of his senses from
drinking salt water.</p>

<p>We prisoners were far too miserable to converse. We lay by the
water's edge, covered by sand and longing for darkness; and when it
came we were only a little less wretched than before. Our raging
thirst and our burned and blistered bodies made sleep impossible.
The following morning the <i>Pandora's</i> master was sent in the
pinnace to the scene of the wreck to learn whether anything else
might be recovered from it. He returned with a part of the
topgallant masts which were above water, and with a cat which he
had found perched on the cross-trees. This poor animal was saved
only to be sacrificed to the needs of shipwrecked seamen. It was
cooked and eaten that same day, and a cap was made from its fur to
cover the bald head of one of the officers who had lost his
wig.</p>

<p>The following day was a repetition of the preceding one. In the
early morning a search was made in the shallow water along the
sand-bar for shellfish, and a number of giant cockles were
discovered; but the thirst of every man was so great that these
could not be eaten and had to be thrown away. The carpenters were
employed in preparing the boats for the long voyage ahead of us.
The floor boards were cut into uprights which were fastened to the
gunwales, and around these canvas was stretched to prevent the sea
from breaking into the boats, for they would all be so heavily
loaded as to leave very little freeboard.</p>

<p>On the morning of August 31, the repairs to the boats having
been completed, Captain Edwards mustered the company. We prisoners
were herded together, under guard, a little to one side of the
others. Officers, seamen, and prisoners alike, we were as gaunt and
woebegone a crowd as had ever been cast ashore from a shipwrecked
vessel. Edwards was clad in his shirt, trousers, and pumps, without
stockings. Dr. Hamilton was in a like costume except that he had
lost his shoes; but he had saved his medicine chest, and he took an
opportunity to whisper to me that my Journal and manuscripts had
been saved with it. Most of the sailors were naked to the waist,
but had managed to come ashore in their trousers, and, with the
exception of three or four, wore turbans made of large red or
yellow handkerchiefs twisted about their heads, a common article of
dress among the men at sea. Of the prisoners, four of us were stark
naked, and the others had only rags of pulpy Indian bark cloth
about their waists. We were all without hats and our bodies were
seared and blistered by the sun. Muspratt in particular suffered
terribly from his burns. Our condition spoke eloquently for us, but
Edwards would have done nothing had it not been that Dr. Hamilton
urged him to allow the naked men to have some remnants of canvas.
It was owing to the surgeon that they had some slight covering from
the pitiless sun.</p>

<p>Edwards walked up and down in front of the company for some
time. We were gathered in a half-circle before the boats, which
were ready to be launched. The sky was cloudless and the sea of the
deepest blue, save where it broke over the reefs and shoals that
stretched away before us. We waited in silence for the captain to
speak. Presently he turned and faced us.</p>

<p>"Men," he said, "we have a long and dangerous voyage ahead of
us. The nearest port at which we can expect help is the Dutch
settlement on the island of Timor, between four and five hundred
leagues from this place. We shall pass various islands on our way,
but they are inhabited by savages from whom we have nothing to
expect but the barbarity common to such people. Our supply of
provision is so scant that each man's allowance will be small
indeed; but it will be sufficient to maintain life even though we
are unable to add to it during the passage. Each of us, officers,
men, and prisoners alike, will receive the following allowance,
which will be issued each day at noon: two ounces of bread, half an
ounce of portable soup, half an ounce of essence of malt, two small
glasses of water, and one of wine. It is to be hoped that we shall
be able to add to our supplies during the voyage, but this cannot
be counted upon.</p>

<p>"With favouring winds and weather we may be able to reach Timor
in fourteen or fifteen days, but I must warn you that we can
scarcely expect such good fortune. But within three weeks, if we
meet with no accidents on the way, we shall be approaching our
destination. Most of our provision must be carried in the launch,
and for this reason, as well as for support and defense, the boats
must keep together.</p>

<p>"I expect implicit obedience from every man, and cheerful and
immediate compliance with the orders issued by your officers. Our
safety depends upon this, and any infringement of discipline will
be severely dealt with.</p>

<p>"Captain William Bligh, in a boat laden more deeply than any of
ours, and with provision even more scanty, has made the same voyage
that we are to make. He must have passed near this spot, and at
that time he and his men had sailed and rowed their boat between
six and seven hundred leagues. And he arrived at Timor with the
loss of only one man. What he has done, we can do."</p>

<p>Edwards now turned to us.</p>

<p>"As for you," he continued, "you are not to forget that you are
pirates and mutineers being taken to England to suffer the
punishment you so richly merit. I am ordered by His Majesty's
Government to have a proper regard for the preservation of your
lives. This duty I shall continue to fulfill."</p>

<p>This was the first, indeed the only, time he condescended to
address us directly.</p>

<p>The boats were now dragged into the water, and our company was
distributed among them. Morrison, Ellison, and I were assigned to
the captain's pinnace.</p>

<p>We were delayed in starting owing to the condition of the seaman
Connell, the man who had drunk salt water to allay his thirst. All
through the previous night he had been raving mad, and it was plain
that he had only a few hours to live. In his condition it was
impossible to take him into any of the boats. His sufferings were
horrible, and offered an object lesson to anyone who might have
been tempted to follow his example. Death came mercifully at about
ten o'clock in the morning, and in his haste to embark Edwards read
no burial service over the body. A shallow grave was scooped in the
sand, and it was the work of no more than five minutes to bury him
there. A lump of sun-blackened coral was placed as a headstone. No
British seaman, I imagine, has had a lonelier grave.</p>

<p>We now quickly embarked, and, with the pinnace in the van, set
out on our voyage to Timor.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c19" id="c19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.&mdash;TEN WEARY
MONTHS</h2>

<p>We had a fair wind and a calm sea, and the sail was hoisted
directly we left the key. Edwards sat at the tiller. He looked as
gaunt and ill-kempt as any of his men, but his lips were set in
their usual thin line, and from the expression on his face he might
have been walking the quarter-deck of the <i>Pandora</i>. One of
the men cried, "Ho for Timor, lads!" but there was no response. We
were so tortured by thirst that scarcely a word passed among the
company.</p>

<p>Morrison, Ellison, and I had been placed in the bow of the
pinnace. Her burden of twenty-four men brought her low in the water
and made it impossible for Edwards to separate us from the seamen;
but lest we should somehow contaminate them, he took the precaution
of placing Hayward, and Rickards, the master's mate, next to us.
When it was necessary for either of them to take the tiller,
Packer, the gunner or Edmonds, the captain's clerk, took his place.
When the wind failed we took our turns at the oars with the others,
but we were never permitted to forget that we were pirates on the
way to a rope's end on some ship of war in Portsmouth Harbour.
Hayward evidently felt the awkwardness of his situation in being
placed directly beside us in a small boat; but under Edwards's
watchful eye he managed to maintain toward us his usual manner of
contemptuous aloofness.</p>

<p>The calm sea was less than half a dozen miles in extent; then we
found ourselves, as before the wreck, in the midst of a maze of
sandbars and half-drowned reefs, leagues distant from any land. The
currents and tide-rips were as strong as they were treacherous, and
it was necessary to take in sail and trust to the oars; but with
the boat so heavily laden it was heart-breaking work keeping clear
of the shoals. The floor of the sea was a miracle of vivid
colouring, but its beauty became hateful to us, and I remember with
what longing we looked ahead for the deep blue water that meant
safety.</p>

<p>At midday our allowance of food and water was issued. Edwards
had devised a pair of scales, using two musket balls for weights,
and the water and wine were measured in a small glass. We had but
two of these glasses, and it was necessary for each man to drink
his allowance at once so that others might be served; but later we
provided ourselves with clam shells which enabled us to sip as
slowly as we pleased.</p>

<p>All the morning the four boats had kept within a mile of one
another, and the work at the oars had increased our thirst to the
point of agony. Most of us were without hats, and the heat of the
tropical sun was like a heavy weight upon the brain. The only
relief from it was to wet such garments as we had and place them on
our heads, and many sponged their bodies, as well, with sea water,
but the absorption through the skin of the salts in the water
increased thirst and gave a nauseating taste to the saliva. Some of
the men, made reckless by suffering, begged or demanded an
increased allowance of water, and one of them, in the launch, after
he had drunk his own allowance, tried to seize the glass of another
as it was being passed from hand to hand, and the precious liquid
was spilled. The man was immediately knocked senseless by Bowling,
one of the master's mates, who clubbed him over the head with an
emptied bottle. Under the circumstances, it was a well-deserved
punishment. Edwards now spoke to the company.</p>

<p>"It is my purpose," he said, "to bring every man of you safe to
Timor; but if we have another incident of this kind, the one
responsible for it shall be shot. Let each man remember that his
sufferings are shared by all of the others. To-morrow we shall be
close in with the coast of Australia. Somewhere along that coast we
shall undoubtedly find water; I promise that we shall not leave it
until we do. Meanwhile, bear in mind what I have said."</p>

<p>From the condition of my own parched lips and swollen tongue, I
was able to appreciate what an effort it must have cost Edwards to
make even so brief an address to the company. We proceeded on our
way, the four boats keeping within view of each other during the
afternoon, and before sunset we had passed through the worst of the
reefs and had more open water before us. The pinnace, which was
still in the van, lay-to to allow the other boats to come up with
her, and we made fast, bow and stern, lest we should become
separated during the night. Never, I imagine, have men welcomed the
coming of darkness more gratefully. The breeze was cool, and
carried us smoothly on the way we would go. Oars were laid over the
thwarts, and by this means we were able to stow two tiers of men,
which gave us room to' stretch our limbs a little.</p>

<p>At dawn the lines were again cast off, and each boat proceeded
as best it could. We were now close in with the northernmost coast
of Australia, but whether it was the continent itself or one of the
innumerable islands adjoining it, no one of us knew. The land had
an arid look, and we gazed at it with hopeless eyes, for it seemed
unlikely that we should find water there. The pinnace and the red
yawl were close together at this time. For several hours we coasted
along within half a mile of the shore. We saw no signs of man or
beast, and the vegetation was nothing more than scattered trees and
hardy shrubs that looked as tortured with thirst as ourselves.</p>

<p>We came to an inlet that deeply indented the coast. The breeze
died down, the oars were gotten out, and we rowed into the bay.
Here the water was like a sheet of glass, reflecting the sky and
the brown shore line. It was about three miles to the head of the
bay, but, eager though we were to reach it, we made but slow
progress in our enfeebled condition. As we approached we saw a
narrow valley where the vegetation was of a much richer green,
which made it all but certain that water was to be found there. At
last we brought up within wading distance of the beach, and in
their eagerness some of the men leaped into the water; but Edwards
ordered them back until a guard had been told off in each of the
boats to watch over the prisoners. The rest of the company were
then permitted to go ashore, and we watched with feverish eyes as
they spread out along the bay and proceeded inland. Then a shout
was heard, and all of them rushed like madmen to one spot. An
excellent spring had been found within fifty yards of the beach. It
was all that our guards could do to prevent themselves from rushing
after the others.</p>

<p>The delay was torture, but our turn came at last. We drank and
drank and drank again until we could hold no more. Nothing mattered
now. Having been relieved from the most terrible of all man's
bodily sufferings, we were content. Those whose thirst was quenched
crawled into the shade of the trees and fell asleep at once. They
lay sprawled like dead men, around the spring. Edwards would gladly
have remained here, but the launch and the blue yawl had, somehow,
missed the bay and, shut in by land as we were, it was impossible
to signal them. Therefore the men were kicked or buffeted awake by
the officers, and having filled our small keg, the teakettle, two
bottles, and even a pair of water-tight boots belonging to the
gunner, we re-embarked. Several of the seamen were so exhausted
that it was impossible to waken them. They were carried aboard and
dropped into the bottom of the boats.</p>

<p>When we had emerged from the bay we saw the launch and the blue
yawl far ahead of us. We made all haste to come up with them and
signalled by musket fire; but the signals were not heard, and it
was not until mid-afternoon that we managed to get abreast of them.
They had found no water and we were now too far to leeward to
permit them to return to the bay where the spring was. Edwards
issued three wineglasses of water to each man in the two boats, and
we made sail again.</p>

<p>At daybreak the following morning we were not far from an island
that proved to be inhabited. It looked much less desolate than the
mainland. The white sandy beach soon gave way to rising ground
where there was abundant vegetation. We searched eagerly for a
landing place; but we had been seen from afar, and as we proceeded
the Indians gathered in ever greater numbers, following us along
the beach. They were jet-black in colour and stark naked, and armed
with spears and bows and arrows. Finding a break in the reef, we
entered a narrow lagoon and approached to within half a cable's
length of the shore. In a moment the place was thronged with
savages in a state of great excitement, and it was evident that
they had never before seen white men. We made signs to them that we
wanted water, and after much persuasion half a dozen of them were
coaxed near enough to the boats to enable us to give them some
buttons cut from various articles of clothing. They took the keg of
the pinnace, the only container of any size that we had for water,
and presently returned with it filled. The eager, desperate haste
with which we drank would have offered a pitiful sight to any
civilized observer, but the savages laughed and yelled with delight
as they watched us. The keg was soon emptied and again given to
them, but upon bringing it back a second time they placed it on the
beach and made signs for us to come and fetch it. This Edwards
would not allow to be done, suspecting treachery, and he ordered
the boats to push off to a safer distance. At this sign of timidity
on our part the natives rushed forward to the water's edge and
discharged a shower of arrows at us. Fortunately no one was hit,
although there were many narrow escapes. One arrow struck a thwart
in our boat, piercing an oak plank an inch thick. A volley was then
fired over their heads, and the sound and the smoke so frightened
them that all ran for their lives, and in an instant the beach was
deserted. The pinnace pushed in to recover the keg. We got it, and
none too soon, for the savages rushed out again, but we made off
before any harm was done.</p>

<p>The savages were so numerous and so hostile that Edwards
abandoned hope of refreshment here. Other islands were in view at
this time, and rather than risk the loss of any of the company, we
were ordered to proceed to the nearest of these. About two o'clock
in the morning we entered a small bay which I still remember with
the keenest pleasure. It was a cool cloudless night, with a late
moon casting a glamorous light over the glassy surface of the
water. The four boats entered in complete silence as a precaution
against the presence of savages. We disembarked upon a beach of
coral sand, packed hard and firm, and delightfully cool to our bare
feet. The prisoners were taken aside under a guard, and two parties
were told off to make an exploration of the place. The rest of the
company remained by the boats with their arms in readiness. In
about an hour's time the search parties returned with the welcome
news that the place was deserted, and that they had found water.
Every man had his thirst quenched that night. Sentinels were then
posted, and all of the others stretched out on the cool sand for
the sleep so desperately needed.</p>

<p>I awoke shortly after dawn, feeling completely refreshed and
very hungry. The bay was still in shadow, but the light was
streaming up from behind the green hills enclosing it. Morrison was
awake, but the rest of the prisoners, as well as the
<i>Pandora's</i> company, were sleeping as though they would never
have done. Edwards let them have their sleep out, but as the men
awakened they were sent out in small parties to search for food. A
pleasanter refuge than this bay afforded could scarcely have been
found, except for the fact that no food-bearing trees could be
discovered, nor did those searching the shallows of the bay have
any better success. Morrison and I proposed to the master-at-arms
that the prisoners be permitted to forage for the ship's company.
The request was carried to Edwards, who granted it with great
reluctance. To be indebted to a group of pirates and mutineers for
benefits of any kind was opposed to all his ideas of fitness; but,
his own men having failed to discover anything save a few sea
snails, we were sent out, well guarded, to see what we could
do.</p>

<p>We made fishlines of bark cut into thin strips and braided, and
we devised fish hooks with some nails furnished us by the
carpenter. With other nails and long slender poles cut from the
bush, we made fish spears, and, thus provided, we set out with the
ever-present marines accompanying us in one of the ship's
boats.</p>

<p>During our long sojourn at Tahiti we had learned how and where
to search for shellfish, and within two hours we returned with the
boat loaded with fish, lobsters, mussels, and the like, enough for
two good meals for the whole company. We received no word of thanks
from Edwards, and immediately we had returned we had the guard
round us as before; but it was enough for us to see with what
relish all hands partook of the meal.</p>

<p>We remained at this place, which Edwards named "Laforey's
Island," all of that day and the following night. We found no
Indians, but it was plainly used by them as a place of frequent
resort. The ground in the vicinity of the spring was much footworn,
and two or three well-used paths led over the hills toward the
interior. Near the shore we found some heaps of sun-bleached human
bones which gave us reason to believe that the people were
cannibals. On the morning of September 2 we again embarked, greatly
refreshed, and before nightfall had reached the open sea beyond
Endeavour Straits.</p>

<p>For all the years that have passed, I still have a clear
recollection of the feeling of horror and gloom that, at this time,
seized the greater part of the men in the pinnace. Timor was still
a thousand miles distant, and not many of us had more than a dim
hope of reaching it. We had far more than our share of
faint-hearts, for the <i>Pandora's</i> crew had been made up
largely of landsmen, with no sense of the traditions of the sea,
unaccustomed to the dangers and hardships which sailors take as a
matter of course. Above all, they were ignorant of what a good
ship's boat can do when ably handled. Luckily, most of the
<i>Pandora's</i> officers were thorough seamen, and there was a
saving leaven of the same type among the men.</p>

<p>Now that we were once more in the open sea, new dangers
presented themselves. There was a heavy westerly swell running, and
with our boats so deep in the water we were kept bailing
constantly. Our only vessels were some giant mussel shells we had
found at Laforey's Island, and they were heavy and ill-adapted to
the purpose. During the first day we had not a moment of rest. The
wind had come round to the east and, running counter to the swell,
made a dangerous sea. There were times when every man of us was
bailing who could be spared for the purpose, and at midday it was
only with great difficulty that the food and water could be
issued.</p>

<p>At nightfall the boats were again fastened to each other, but
the towlines broke repeatedly, and we were in such danger of being
dashed to pieces against each other that we were obliged to cast
off and trust to Providence that we should be able to keep
together. Muskets were fired in each of the boats at two-hour
intervals, but these signals could not always be made, owing to our
powder being wetted. At dawn we found ourselves widely scattered,
and the blue yawl was so far to windward that for an hour or two we
thought we had lost her; but at last we caught sight of her
masthead as she rose to the crest of a sea.</p>

<p>By midday we had again assembled, and the meagre allowance of
food and water was passed around. Those noonday meetings have left
a series of indelible pictures in my mind. I see the blue yawl or
the launch slowly approaching, looking inconceivably small and
lonely, now lost to view in the trough of the sea, now clearly
outlined against the sky as it rose to the swell. At last it is
near enough so that we can make out the figures of the men,
bailing, bailing, bailing, without respite. Now we are within half
a cable's length of each other, and I see the faces, gaunt and
hollow-eyed, and the expression of unutterable weariness upon each
of them. We would stare at each other like so many spectres.
Sometimes Edwards would call across to one of his officers: "How do
you prosper, Mr. Corner?" or, "Is it well with your company, Mr.
Passmore?" And the reply would come back, "We're not doing badly,
sir." Then we would approach each other as closely as we dared
while the precious food and water were being passed from boat to
boat.</p>

<p>Dr. Hamilton was a tower of strength to the men in the red yawl.
He suffered as much as the rest of us, but he heartened and
encouraged everyone at these midday meetings. I was glad for the
sake of Muspratt and Burkitt that the surgeon was with them, for
Parkin was in charge of the red yawl, and he would have found the
means to increase the misery of the prisoners had it not been for
the doctor.</p>

<p>A curious incident occurred in the pinnace at one of these
noonday assemblies. An elderly sailor named Thompson had carried
with him from the wreck of the <i>Pandora</i> a small bag of
dollars, his savings during many years. When the day's allowance of
water was being issued, a wineglass was passed to the man sitting
next him, a Scot named McPherson. Prompted by his raging thirst,
Thompson offered the whole of his savings for this small glass of
water. McPherson's struggle was a bitter one. His desire for the
dollars&mdash;and it was a goodly sum, sewed up in a canvas
bag&mdash;was almost equally balanced by his desire for the two or
three mouthfuls of water the glass contained. The rest of us forgot
our misery for a moment as we waited to see the result. Presently
the master's mate said: "Do one thing or the other and be quick
about it."</p>

<p>"Give me the bag," said McPherson, but while Thompson was
loosening the cord which held it to his waist, the Scot thought
better of the matter and drank his allowance of water at a
gulp.</p>

<p>The sufferings of the older men were, naturally, greater than
those of the younger ones. A midshipman, who was no more than a
boy, sold his allowance of water two days running for another man's
allowance of bread. So terrible is thirst that several of the men
drank their own urine. They died, without exception, in the sequel
of the voyage.</p>

<p>We again attempted to keep the boats together by towing, during
the nights of the fifth and sixth of September, but the lines broke
as usual, and the strain on the boats was so great that we were
obliged to abandon this method of keeping together during the
night. Edwards had given his officers the exact latitude of Timor,
and the longitude by the timekeeper on that date. This in case we
should become separated. Fortunately, we managed to keep within
sight of each other during the whole of the following week. In the
pinnace we caught one booby, and the blood and flesh were divided
into twenty-four shares and distributed in the old seaman's manner
of "Who shall have this?" This good fortune came on the eleventh of
September, at a time when we were sorely in need of it.</p>

<p>On the morning of the thirteenth land was sighted, a faint
bluish blur on the Western horizon. At first we could not believe
it possible that Timor was within view, but as the morning wore on
even the skeptics were convinced that it was land and not cloud
that we saw. We were so wretched in mind and body that we could not
even summon up the strength to cheer when Rickards said, "It's
Timor, lads. No doubt of it."</p>

<p>To add to our misery, it fell dead calm about the middle of the
afternoon. The oars were gotten out and we proceeded wearily on.
The boats now separated, each one being in haste to make the land.
Some of the older men in the pinnace were by now so helpless that
they lacked the strength to sit upright. They lay huddled in the
bottom of the boat, moaning and crying out for water.</p>

<p>By noon of the following day we were close in with the land. The
other boats were not in sight. The torture of thirst had become so
great that Edwards decided to pass out our remaining supply of
water, which came to half a bottle per man. This greatly refreshed
us and we proceeded along the coast, seeking a possible landing
place.</p>

<p>I remember nothing of the hinterlands of Timor. I have in mind
only a dim picture of green hills and distant mountains. Every
man's gaze, like my own, was fixed on the foreshore. There was a
high surf running, and for several hours we found no place at which
a boat could be landed without risk of its being dashed to pieces.
Toward sunset we came to a more sheltered part of the coast, and
two of the sailors swam ashore with bottles fastened about their
necks. They proceeded along the beach, the boat following, until it
was almost dark, without finding so much as a muddy creek where we
might have refreshed ourselves. Having taken them aboard again, we
stood off the land. We had the breeze again and made good progress
during the night. The next morning we found an excellent landing
place, and near it the water so urgently needed. I doubt whether
some of the men could have survived another day without it, for we
had been upon short rations so long that all the bodily juices were
dried up.</p>

<p>About twelve o'clock on the night of September 15, the pinnace
came to a grapnel off the float by the fort in Coupang Bay. It was
a calm night with the sky ablaze with stars. The settlement was
asleep. A ship was anchored not far from where we lay, and two or
three smaller craft, but in the darkness we were unable to see
whether any of the other boats of the <i>Pandora</i> had arrived.
The night was profoundly still. On the high rampart of the fort a
dog stood, barking mournfully. That was our welcome to Coupang.
Worn out with our long journey, we remained where we were until
daylight, sleeping huddled in our places, and never, I imagine,
have men slept more soundly.</p>

<p>I shall give only a brief account of our experiences from the
morning of our arrival at Coupang until the day when we sighted the
cliffs of Old England. Captain Edwards and his men doubtless
enjoyed the stay at Coupang, where they were the guests of the
Dutch East India Company. As for the prisoners, we were guests of
another sort. We were taken at once to the fort and placed in
stocks in the guardroom, a dreary place with a bare stone floor,
and lighted by two small barred windows high in the wall. Parkin
took charge of us again, and he saw to it that we lacked even the
most primitive means for comfort. Edwards never once visited us,
but we were not forgotten by Dr. Hamilton. During the first week at
Timor, he was kept busy attending the <i>Pandora's</i> sick,
several of whom died within a few days of our arrival; but as soon
as he was free to do so he paid us a visit, accompanied by the
Dutch surgeon of the place. So foul was our prison by that time
that before they could enter it the place had to be scrubbed out by
slaves, and ourselves with it. We begged Dr. Hamilton to use his
influence so that Lieutenant Corner might be placed in charge of
us; but Corner being a decent and humane man, Edwards would not
consent to this. We remained in Parkin's care, and he made our life
so wretched that we wished ourselves dead a dozen times over before
we reached the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>On October 6 the entire company was embarked on the
<i>Rembang</i>, a Dutch East India ship, for the passage to
Batavia, on the island of Java. The <i>Rembang</i> was an ancient
vessel, and leaked so badly that it was necessary to work the pumps
every hour in the twenty-four. We prisoners were kept at this work,
and, exhausting though it was, we preferred it to confinement below
decks. Near the island of Flores a great storm arose, which struck
us so suddenly that every sail on the ship was torn to ribbons. The
Dutch sailors believed the vessel lost, and there was reason to
think so, for the pumps became choked and useless at the time when
we most needed them, and the ship was fast driving on a lee shore
only seven miles distant. It was due to Edwards, who took command,
and the exertion of some of our British tars, that we weathered the
storm.</p>

<p>We arrived at Samarang on October 30, and here, to the amazement
and delight of everyone, we found the schooner <i>Resolution</i>,
from which we had become separated among the Navigators' Islands
four months earlier. After losing sight of the <i>Pandora</i>,
Oliver, the master's mate in charge of the <i>Resolution</i>, had
cruised about for several days in search of us, and had then
proceeded to the Friendly Islands. Namuka was the island appointed
for a rendezvous in case of such an emergency, but Oliver had gone
to Tofoa, mistaking this island for Namuka, and so had missed us.
He and his crew of nine had undergone dangers and hardships equal
to, if not greater than, our own. Upon reaching the great reef that
stretches between New Guinea and the coast of Australia, they had
searched in vain for an opening, and then formed the desperate
resolve of running over the reef on the crest of a sea. It was a
chance in a hundred, but they succeeded, and were later saved from
death by thirst when they met a small Dutch vessel beyond Endeavour
Straits. Having been supplied with food and water, they pursued
their voyage to Samarang, where we found them.</p>

<p>Edwards sold the <i>Resolution</i> at Samarang, and the money
was divided among the <i>Pandora's</i> crew for the purchase of
clothing and other necessities. This seemed hard upon Morrison and
the other prisoners who had built the schooner. Not a shilling did
they receive, but they at least had the satisfaction of knowing
that they had built a staunch little ship, as good as any turned
out by the shipwrights of England. After her sale at Samarang she
had a long and honourable career in the western Pacific, and made
the record passage between China and the Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p>At Samarang the <i>Rembang</i> was reconditioned and we
proceeded to Batavia, where the company was divided and
transshipped to four vessels of the Dutch East India Company for
the long voyage to Holland. Captain Edwards, with Lieutenant
Parkin, the master, purser, gunner, clerk, two midshipmen, and the
ten prisoners from the <i>Bounty</i>, embarked on the
<i>Vreedenburg</i>, and on January 15, 1792, we arrived at the Cape
of Good Hope, where we found H.M.S. <i>Gorgon</i> awaiting orders
for England. Edwards therefore left the <i>Vreedenburg</i> and took
passage for all of his party on the <i>Gorgon</i>. We remained at
the Cape for nearly three months, during which time we were
confined on the <i>Gorgon</i>. Mr. Gardner, first lieutenant of
that vessel, treated us with great humanity. We were chained by one
leg only, instead of having both feet and both hands in irons as
heretofore, and we were given an old sail to lie upon at night, a
luxury we had not enjoyed during the previous twelve months. On the
long passage to England we were permitted to remain on deck for
several hours each day to enjoy the fresh air. This circumstance
was galling to Edwards, who would have kept us below during all
that weary time; but as the ship was not his, he was not in a
position to protest.</p>

<p>On the nineteenth of June we arrived off Spithead, and before
dark had anchored in Portsmouth Harbour. Four years and six months
had passed since the <i>Bounty's</i> departure from England, during
which time we had spent nearly fifteen months in irons.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c20" id="c20"></a>CHAPTER XX.&mdash;SIR JOSEPH
BANKS</h2>

<p>Every vessel in Portsmouth Harbour knew of the arrival of the
<i>Gorgon</i>, and that she had brought home with her some of the
notorious <i>Bounty</i> mutineers. The harbour was crowded with
shipping at this time, merchant vessels and ships of war. Among the
latter was H.M.S. <i>Hector</i>, and on the morning of June 21,
1792, we were transferred to this vessel to await court-martial. It
was a cloudy day, threatening rain, with a fresh breeze blowing,
and the choppy waves slapped briskly against the bow of the boat.
As we passed ship after ship we saw rows of heads looking down at
us from the high decks, and groups of men crowded at the gun-ports
for a view of us. We knew only too well what they were thinking and
saying to each other: "Thank God I'm not in any of those men's
boots!"</p>

<p>We were received with impressive solemnity on board the
<i>Hector</i>. A double line of marines with fixed bayonets were
drawn up on either side of the gangway. There was a deep silence as
we passed between them and down to the lower gundeck. No doubt we
looked like pirates in our nondescript clothing acquired here and
there all the way from Timor to England. Some of us were without
hats, others without shoes, and none of us had anything resembling
a uniform. The rags that we wore consisted of cast-off garments
given us by various kind-hearted English sailors at Batavia and at
Table Bay,&mdash;chiefly by men of the <i>Gorgon</i>,&mdash;and
they were in a wretched state indeed by the time we reached home.
We were conducted to the gun room which lay right aft, and it was a
great relief to find that the treatment to which Edwards had so
long accustomed us was now a thing of the past. We were regarded,
not as condemned men, but as prisoners awaiting trial, and what a
world of difference this made can be appreciated only by men who
have been placed in a similar situation. Neither leg irons nor
handcuffs were placed upon us, and we had the freedom of the gun
room, which was guarded by marines. We had decent food, hammocks to
sleep in, and were granted all privileges comportable with our
position as prisoners.</p>

<p>Considering our hardships and the fact that we had been so long
in irons, it is remarkable that we were all in good health. None of
us had been ill in all that time, and yet many of the
<i>Pandora's</i> company had been continually ailing, and more than
a dozen of them had died at Timor and Samarang and Batavia. No
doubt Edwards took credit to himself for our condition, but he
deserved none. We were well, not because of his treatment, but in
spite of it.</p>

<p>We had not been above an hour on board the <i>Hector</i> when I
was summoned to the cabin of Captain Montague, who commanded the
vessel. He dismissed the guard and bade me, in a most kindly
fashion, to be seated. No mention was made of the mutiny. For a
quarter of an hour he chatted with me in the courteous, affable
manner he might have used toward one of his officers whom he had
asked to dine with him. He questioned me at length concerning the
wreck of the <i>Pandora</i>, and our subsequent adventures on the
voyage to Timor. He was evidently interested in the story, but I
was sure that I had not been summoned merely to entertain him with
an account of our experiences. At length he opened a drawer in his
table and drew forth a small packet which he handed to me.</p>

<p>"I have some letters for you, Mr. Byam. You may have as much
time as you like here, alone. When you are ready to return to your
quarters you have only to open the door and inform the guard."</p>

<p>He then left me, and I opened the packet with trembling hands.
It contained a letter from Sir Joseph Banks, written only a few
days earlier, upon his receipt of the news of the <i>Gorgon's</i>
arrival. He informed me that my mother had died six weeks before,
and enclosed a letter to me written the night before her death,
forwarded to him by our old servant, Thacker.</p>

<p>I was grateful indeed to Captain Montague for the privilege of
half an hour's privacy in his cabin; but there was no relief, then
or later, for the desolation of heart I felt. Scarcely a day had
passed, in the years since the <i>Bounty</i> had left England, that
I had not thought of my mother and longed for her, and the
consciousness of her love had sustained me through all the weary
months of our imprisonment. There was never any question of her
belief in my innocence, but she was as proud in spirit as she was
gentle and kind-hearted, and the slur cast upon our good name by
the event of the mutiny&mdash;above all, the fact that Bligh
considered me among the guiltiest of the mutineers&mdash;was a
shock beyond her strength to withstand. There was nothing of this
in her letter; I had the facts, later, from Thacker, who told me
that my mother's health had begun to fail from the day when she had
received the letter from Bligh. I have made all possible allowances
for him. He had reason to believe that I was an accomplice of
Christian; but a man with a spark of humanity would never have
written the letter he sent to my mother. I no more forgive him the
cruelty of it now than I did when I first read it.</p>

<p>It was the irony of my fate that, having been blessed with the
steadfast love of two women, I should now&mdash;at a time when I
most needed them&mdash;be separated from my mother by death and
from my Indian wife by half the circumference of the globe. Upon
these two I had centred all my affections. Now that my mother was
gone, I clung to the memory of Tehani more tenderly than ever
before.</p>

<p>What might now happen seemed a matter of little consequence. I
could not imagine life in England without my mother; the thought
that I might lose her had never occurred to me. But when I became
calmer, I realized that, for her sake at least, it was necessary to
clear our name from the stigma attached to it. I must prove my
innocence beyond all question.</p>

<p>Sir Joseph Banks came to see me only a few days after I had
received his letter. My own father could not have been kinder. He
had seen my mother only a few weeks before her death, and he gave
me all of the small details of that visit. He remembered everything
she had said, and he allowed me to question him to my heart's
content. I felt immeasurably comforted and strengthened. Sir Joseph
was one of those men who seem members of a race apart; who find
themselves equally at home among all kinds and conditions of
people. In appearance he was a typical John Bull, solidly made,
with the clear ruddy complexion our English climate gives. He
seemed to radiate energy, and no man could be five minutes in his
presence without being the better for it. At this time he was
President of the Royal Society, and his name was known and
honoured, not only in England, but on the Continent as well. I
doubt whether there was a busier man in London, and yet, during
those anxious weeks before the court-martial, one would have
thought that his only concern was to see to it that all of us were
given justice and fair play.</p>

<p>He quickly roused me from my despairing mood, and I found myself
talking with interest and enthusiasm of my Tahitian dictionary and
grammar. I told him that my manuscripts had been saved from the
wreck of the <i>Pandora</i> and were in the care of Dr. Hamilton,
now on his way home with the rest of the <i>Pandora's</i>
survivors.</p>

<p>"Excellent, Byam! Excellent!" he said. "There is one gain, at
least, from the voyage of the <i>Bounty</i>." He had the faculty of
entering with enthusiasm into another man's work, and of making him
feel that there was nothing more important. "I shall see Dr.
Hamilton the moment he arrives in England. But enough of this for
the present. Now I want your story of the mutiny&mdash;the whole of
it&mdash;every detail."</p>

<p>"You have heard Captain Bligh's account, sir? You know how black
the case against me appears to be?"</p>

<p>"I do," he replied, gravely. "Captain Bligh is my good friend,
but I know his faults of character as well as his virtues. His
belief in your guilt is sincerely held; yet allow me to say that I
have never for a moment doubted your innocence."</p>

<p>"Is Captain Bligh now in England, sir?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No. He has again been sent to Tahiti to fulfill the task of
conveying breadfruit plants to the West Indies. This time, I hope,
the voyage will be successfully completed."</p>

<p>This was serious news for me. I felt certain that, if I could
confront Bligh, I could convince him of my innocence, force him to
acknowledge that he had been mistaken in jumping to the conclusion
that the conversation with Christian had concerned the mutiny. With
him gone, only his sworn deposition at the Admiralty would confront
me, and there was no possibility of its being retracted.</p>

<p>"Put all that aside, Byam," said Sir Joseph. "There is no help
for it, and all your desire to confront Bligh won't bring him back
in time for the court-martial. Now proceed with your story, and
remember that I am completely in the dark with respect to the part
you played."</p>

<p>I then gave him, as I had given Dr. Hamilton, a complete account
of the mutiny, and of all that had happened since. He allowed me to
finish with scarcely an interruption. When I had done so I waited
anxiously for him to speak.</p>

<p>"Byam, we may as well face the facts. You are in grave danger.
Mr. Nelson, who knew of your intention to go in the launch with
Bligh, is dead. Norton, the quartermaster, who could have
corroborated your story of Christian's intention to escape from the
<i>Bounty</i> on the night before the mutiny, is dead."</p>

<p>"I know it, sir. I had the information from Dr. Hamilton."</p>

<p>"Your chance of acquittal depends almost entirely upon the
testimony of one man: your friend Robert Tinkler."</p>

<p>"But he returned safely to England."</p>

<p>"Yes, but where is he now?...He must be found at once. You say
that he is a brother-in-law of Fryer, the master of the
<i>Bounty</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"In that case I should be able to get trace of him. I can learn,
at the Admiralty, on what ship Fryer is now serving."</p>

<p>I had, somehow, taken it for granted that Tinkler would know of
the need I should have for him if ever I returned home; but Sir
Joseph pointed out to me the fact that Tinkler would be quite
ignorant of this.</p>

<p>"It is not at all likely," he said, "that he will know of
Bligh's depositions at the Admiralty. And it will no more have
occurred to him than it did to you that your conversation with
Christian could be construed as evidence against you. The chances
are that Tinkler will have forgotten that Bligh overheard it. No;
take my word for it, he will have no fears on your account. Not a
moment must be lost in finding him."</p>

<p>"How soon will the court-martial take place, sir?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That rests with the Admiralty, of course. But this matter has
been hanging fire for so long that they will wish to dispose of it
as soon as possible. It will be necessary to wait until the rest of
the <i>Pandora's</i> company arrive, but they should be nearing
England by this time."</p>

<p>Sir Joseph now left me. He was to return to London by that
night's coach.</p>

<p>"You shall hear from me shortly," he said. "Meanwhile, rest
assured that I shall find your friend Tinkler if he is to be found
in England." Our conversation had taken place in Captain Montague's
cabin. The other prisoners were anxiously awaiting my return to the
gun room. Sir Joseph was the first visitor we had had; in fact, we
were not permitted to see anyone except persons officially
connected with the forthcoming court-martial. Sir Joseph was not,
perhaps, so connected, but his interest in the <i>Bounty</i> and
his influence at the Admiralty gave him access to us.</p>

<p>I gave the others an account of my conversation with him,
omitting only his opinion of the fate in store for Millward,
Burkitt, Ellison, and Muspratt. These men were, he thought, doomed
past hope, with the possible exception of Muspratt. Byrne was
entirely innocent of any part in the mutiny, but the poor fellow
had been treated as a condemned man for so long that he had more
than half come to believe himself guilty. As for Coleman, Norman,
and McIntosh, it was inconceivable to any of us that they would be
convicted. Morrison was in a situation only less dangerous than my
own, and it grieved me to think that I was responsible for it. Our
delay below decks on the morning of the mutiny, in the hope of
getting possession of the arms chest, was known only to ourselves,
and the chances were that the story would be regarded as a fiction
invented afterward to explain our absence at the time the launch
put off.</p>

<p>We had talked of the forthcoming court-martial so often during
the long passage to England that we had little more to say to each
other now that the event loomed so ominously near. At times, as a
relief from anxiety, we spoke of our happy life at Tahiti, but for
the most part we spent our days silently, each man engaged in his
own reflections; or we stood at the gun-room ports looking out at
the busy life of the harbour. There were times when I was seized
with a sense of the unreality of this experience, like that one
feels upon waking from some dream in which the events have been
more than usually disconnected and fantastic. Hardest of all to
realize was the fact that we were indeed at home again, lying at
anchor only a few miles from Spithead, whence the <i>Bounty</i> had
sailed so long ago.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, owing to the kindness of Sir Joseph, we were provided
with decent clothing in which to appear before the court-martial.
This small diversion was a most welcome one, and to be properly
clothed again had an excellent effect upon our spirits.</p>

<p>Ten days passed before I had further word from Sir Joseph. The
letter I then received I still have in my possession, although it
is now faded and worn with age. To reread it is to recall vividly
the emotion I felt on the morning when it was handed to me by the
corporal of the guard at the gun-room door.</p>

<blockquote>MY DEAR BYAM:<br>
<br>

<p>I can imagine with what anxiety you are awaiting word from me. I
regret that I cannot go to Portsmouth at this time, for I should
much prefer to give you my news by word of mouth. This being
impossible, a letter must serve.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Upon returning to London I went directly to the Admiralty
office, where I learned that Fryer is now at his home in London,
awaiting summons to testify at the court-martial. I sent for him at
once and learned that Tinkler, shortly after his return to England,
was offered a berth as master's mate on the <i>Carib Maid</i>, a
West India merchantman. The captain of the vessel was a friend of
Fryer's, and as it was a good berth for the lad, offering
opportunity for advancement, he accepted it.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Tinkler returned from his first voyage a year ago, and shortly
afterward set out on a second one. Fryer received word, not three
months since, that the <i>Carib Maid</i> was lost with all hands in
a hurricane near the island of Cuba.<br>
<br></p>

<p>It would be useless to deny the fact that this is a great
misfortune for you. Even so, your situation, I believe, is not
hopeless. I have had a long conversation with Fryer, who speaks of
you in the most friendly terms. He is convinced that you had no
hand in the mutiny, and his testimony will be valuable.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Cole, Purcell, and Peckover I have also seen. They are now
stationed at Deptford, awaiting summons to the court-martial. They
all speak highly of you, and Purcell tells me that you yourself
told him of your intention to leave in the launch with Bligh. They
all know of Bligh's conviction that you were an accomplice of
Christian, and it speaks well for your character among them that
they all believe you innocent.<br>
<br></p>

<p>My good friend, Mr. Graham, who has been Secretary to different
admirals on the Newfoundland Station these past twelve years, and
who has, consequently, acted as Judge Advocate at courts-martial
all of that time, has offered me to attend you. He has a thorough
knowledge of the service, uncommon abilities, and is a good lawyer.
He already has most of the evidences with him.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Farewell, my dear Byam. Keep up your spirits, and rest assured
that I shall be watchful for your good. I shall certainly attend
the court-martial, and now that my friend, Graham, has consented to
go down, I shall be more at ease than if you were attended by the
first counsel in England.</p></blockquote>

<p>My feeling upon reading this letter may be imagined. Sir Joseph
had done what he could to soften the blow to me, but I was under no
doubt as to the seriousness of my position. I knew that, without
Tinkler's evidence, my case was all but desperate, no matter how
ably it might be presented. Nevertheless, I clung to hope as a man
will. I resolved to fight for my life with all the energy I
possessed. In one sense, the stimulus of danger was a blessing in
disguise, for it kept me from brooding over my mother's death. I
put out of mind every thought not connected with the approaching
trial.</p>

<p>Sea officers, as I had been informed by Sir Joseph, have a great
aversion to lawyers. I was well content, therefore, to have Mr.
Graham, a Navy man himself, as my representative. Morrison resolved
to conduct his own case. Coleman, Norman, McIntosh, and Byrne, who
had every reason to hope that they would be cleared of the charges
against them, secured the services of a retired sea officer,
Captain Manly, to represent and advise all four of them; and an
officer from the Admiralty, Captain Bentham, was appointed by the
Crown to care for the interests of the other men.</p>

<p>We were visited by these gentlemen during the following week,
but the first to come was Mr. Graham. He was a tall spare man in
his late fifties, of distinguished bearing, and with a quiet voice
and manner that inspired confidence. From the moment of seeing him
I was sure that my fortunes could not be in better hands. None of
us had any knowledge of court-martial proceedings, and at my
request Mr. Graham permitted us to question him with respect to
these matters.</p>

<p>"I have the morning at your disposal, Mr. Byam," he said, "and I
shall be glad to be of what assistance I can to any of you."</p>

<p>"I mean to conduct my own case, sir," Morrison said. "I should
like particularly to know the exact wording of the Article under
which we are to be tried."</p>

<p>"I can give you that precisely, from memory," Mr. Graham
replied. "It is Article Nineteen, of the Naval Articles of War,
which reads as follows: 'If any person, in or belonging to the
Fleet, shall make, or endeavour to make, any mutinous assembly,
upon any pretense whatsoever, every person offending herein, being
convicted thereof by the sentence of the Court-Martial, shall
suffer death.'"</p>

<p>"Has the Court no alternative course?" I asked.</p>

<p>"None. It must acquit, or convict and condemn to death."</p>

<p>"But supposing, sir, that there are extenuating circumstances,"
Morrison added. "Supposing that a mutiny arises in a ship, as it
did in ours, where a part of the company have no knowledge of any
intention to seize the vessel, and who take no part in the
seizure?"</p>

<p>"If they remain in the vessel with the mutinous party, the law
considers them equally guilty with the others. Our martial law is
very severe in this matter. The man who stands neuter is considered
an offender with him who lifts his hand against his captain."</p>

<p>"But there were some of us, sir," Coleman added, earnestly, "who
would gladly have gone with Captain Bligh when his party was driven
from the ship into the launch. We were retained against our will by
the mutineers, who had need of our services."</p>

<p>"Such a situation calls for special consideration by the Court
and will doubtless receive it," Mr. Graham replied. "If the men so
retained can prove their innocence of any complicity, they stand in
no danger."</p>

<p>"Sir, may I speak?" asked Ellison.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my lad."</p>

<p>"I was one of the mutineers, sir. I'd no hand in starting the
trouble, but like all the rest of us I had no love for Captain
Bligh, and I joined in when I was asked to. Is there any hope for
me?"</p>

<p>Mr. Graham regarded him gravely for a moment.</p>

<p>"I prefer not to give an opinion on that," he said. "Suppose we
let the question be decided by the court-martial itself."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of the truth, sir. If you think there's no
chance, I'd be obliged if you'd tell me so."</p>

<p>But Mr. Graham would not commit himself. "Let me advise all of
you not to prejudge your cases," he said. "I have sat through many
a court-martial, and, as in any civil court of law, one is not
justified in forming an opinion as to a possible verdict until all
the evidence is in. And so you see, young man," he added, turning
to Ellison, "how mistaken I should be in attempting to tell you
what I think."</p>

<p>The days dragged by with painful slowness. Before this time most
of the men had received letters from their families. Some of them
were many months old, but they were read none the less eagerly for
that. With the exception of the letter received from my mother, at
Tahiti, no news from families or friends had reached any of us
during the more than four years we had been absent from home. Poor
Coleman's family lived in Portsmouth, but he was not permitted to
see them. Of all the married members of the <i>Bounty's</i>
company, he was, I suspect, the only man who had remained faithful
to his wife during our sojourn at Tahiti. To be prevented from
seeing her and his children after all these years was a cruel
blow.</p>

<p>July passed, and August, and still we waited.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c21" id="c21"></a>CHAPTER XXI.&mdash;H.M.S. DUKE</h2>

<p>On the morning of September 12, the ten prisoners on board the
<i>Hector</i> were ordered to hold themselves in readiness to
proceed to H.M.S. <i>Duke</i>. It was a grey, chilly, windless day,
so still that we could hear ships' bells from far and near it,
striking the half-hours and the hours. The <i>Duke</i> was anchored
abreast of the <i>Hector</i> and about a quarter of a mile distant.
Shortly before eight o'clock we saw a longboat, with a guard of
marines in dress uniform, put off from the great ship's side and
approach the <i>Hector</i>, and on the stroke of the hour a
solitary gun was fired from the <i>Duke</i>. It was the signal for
the court-martial. Our time had come.</p>

<p>I cannot speak of the emotions of my fellow prisoners at that
solemn moment, but I know that my own feeling was one of profound
relief. We had waited too long and endured too much to be capable
of intense emotion&mdash;at least, that was the case with me. I
felt unutterably weary, in body and mind, and if I desired anything
it was peace&mdash;the peace of certainty as to my fate, whatever
it might be. I remember how impatient I was to arrive on board the
<i>Duke</i>. One's sense of time is largely a matter of mood, and
the voyage from the <i>Hector</i> to the gangway of the larger
ship, brief as it was, seemed all but interminable.</p>

<p>The court-martial was held in the great cabin of the
<i>Duke</i>, which extended the width of the vessel, from the
forward limit of the poop to the stern gallery. The quarter-deck
was thronged with people, chiefly officers in full-dress uniform
who had assembled from the many ships of war in the harbour to
attend the proceedings. There were also a number of civilians, Sir
Joseph Banks among them. Dr. Hamilton, whom I had last seen at the
Cape of Good Hope, was standing with the other officers of the
<i>Pandora</i> by the bulwarks on the larboard side of the deck.
Edwards was there, of course, with his satellite, Parkin, beside
him. He glanced us over with his habitual air of cold hostility,
and he appeared to be thinking: "These scoundrels freed from their
irons? What gross neglect of duty!"</p>

<p>On the other side of the deck were gathered the officers of the
<i>Bounty</i>, looking self-conscious and ill at ease in that
company of ships' captains and admirals and rear admirals. It was a
strange meeting for old shipmates, and many were the silent
messages that passed back and forth as we looked eagerly at each
other. Mr. Fryer, the master, was there, and Cole, the boatswain,
and Purcell, the carpenter, and Peckover, the gunner. A clear
picture flashed into mind of the last view we had had of them as
they looked up at us from the launch across the widening space of
blue water. Little any of us thought then that we should ever meet
again.</p>

<p>The hum of conversation died away to silence as the door of the
great cabin opened. Audience was admitted. The spectators filed
into the room; then we were marched in with a guard, a lieutenant
of marines with a drawn sword in his hand preceding us. We were
ranged in a line by the bulkhead on the right-hand side of the
door. During the first day's proceedings we were compelled to
stand, but owing to the length of the trial, a bench was later
provided for us.</p>

<p>A long table stood fore and aft in the middle of the cabin, with
a chair at the head for the President of the Court; the other
members sat along the sides at his right and left. A little to the
right and to the rear of the President's seat was a small table for
the Judge Advocate, and another, on the opposite side, for the
writers who were to transcribe the proceedings. At still another
table sat the advisors to the prisoners. On either side of the door
leading to the stern gallery, and along the walls, were settees
occupied by the sea officers and civilians who attended as
spectators.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock precisely, the door opened again and the members
of the Court filed in to their places. At the order of the
master-at-arms the audience rose, and when the members of the Court
were in their places, all were seated again. The names of the
twelve men who held over us the power of life and death were as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>The Right Honourable Lord Hood, Vice Admiral of the
Blue, and<br>
Commander-in-Chief of His Majesty's ships and vessels at
Portsmouth<br>
Harbour, <i>President</i><br>
<br>

<p>Captain Sir Andrew Snape Hammond, Bart.<br>
Captain John Colpoys<br>
Captain Sir George Montague<br>
Captain Sir Roger Curtis<br>
Captain John Bazeley<br>
Captain Sir Andrew Snape Douglas<br>
Captain John Thomas Duckworth<br>
Captain John Nicholson Inglefield<br>
Captain John Knight<br>
Captain Albemarle Bertie<br>
Captain Richard Goodwin Keats</p></blockquote>

<p>My lethargy of the earlier part of the morning left me as I
gazed at the impressive scene before me. At first my attention was
fully engaged with our judges, whose faces I examined one by one as
the opportunity presented itself. They were, for the most part, men
in middle life, and one would have known them anywhere, in any
dress, for officers in His Majesty's Navy. As I looked at their
stern, wind-roughened, impassive faces, my heart sank. I recalled
Dr. Hamilton's words: "But these men will know nothing of
Christian's character, and their sympathies will all be with
Captain Bligh. You will have to prove your story of that
conversation with Christian beyond the shadow of a doubt." The only
one of the twelve men who might, I thought, be willing to give a
prisoner the benefit of a doubt was Sir George Montague, captain of
the <i>Hector</i>.</p>

<p>Our names were called, and we stood before the Court while the
charges against us were read. This document was of considerable
length, and recapitulated the history of the <i>Bounty</i> from the
time of her departure from England until she was seized by the
mutineers. Then followed Bligh's sworn statement, his own account
of the mutiny, a document of great interest to all of us, and to me
in particular. The statement, which follows, was read by the Judge
Advocate:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>I respectfully beg to submit to the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty the information that His Majesty's armed vessel,
<i>Bounty</i>, under my command, was taken from me by some of the
inferior officers and men on the 28th of April, 1789, in the
following manner.<br>
<br>

<p>A little before sunrise, Fletcher Christian, who was mate of the
ship and officer of the watch, Charles Churchill, master-at-arms,
Thomas Burkitt, seaman, and John Mills, gunner's mate, came into my
cabin, and, while I was asleep, seized me in my bed and tied my
hands behind my back with a strong cord; and, with cutlasses and
bayonets fixed at my breast, threatened me with instant death if I
spoke or made the least noise. I nevertheless called out so loud
for help that everyone heard me and were flying to my assistance;
but all of my officers except those who were concerned in the
mutiny found themselves secured by armed sentinels.<br>
<br></p>

<p>I was now hauled upon deck in my shirt and without a rag else,
and secured by a guard abaft the mizzenmast, during which the
mutineers expressed much joy at my position.<br>
<br></p>

<p>I demanded of Christian the cause of such a violent act, but no
answer was given but, "Hold your tongue, sir, or you are dead this
instant!" He held me by the cord which tied my hands, and
threatened to stab me with the bayonet he held in his right hand.
I, however, did my utmost to rally the disaffected villains to a
sense of their duty, but to no effect.<br>
<br></p>

<p>The boatswain was ordered to hoist the launch out, and while I
was kept under a guard with Christian at their head, the officers
and men not concerned in the mutiny were ordered into the boat.
This being done, I was told by Christian: "Sir, your officers and
men are now in the boat and you must go with them," and the guard
carried me across the deck with their bayonets presented on every
side. Upon attempting to make some resistance, one of the villains
said to another: "Damn his eyes, the dog! Blow his brains out!" I
was at last forced into the boat and we were then veered astern, in
all, nineteen souls.<br>
<br></p>

<p>While the boat was yet alongside, the boatswain and carpenter
and some others collected several necessary things, and with some
difficulty a compass and quadrant were got, but no arms of any kind
and none of my maps or drawings. The size of the boat was 23 feet
from stem to stern, and rowed six oars. We were cast adrift with
the following provision: 25 gallons of water, 150 pounds of bread,
30 pounds of pork, 6 quarts of rum, and 6 bottles of wine.<br>
<br></p>

<p>The boat was so lumbered and deep in the water that it was
believed we could never reach the shore, and some of the pirates
made their joke of this. I asked for arms, but the request was
received with the greatest abuse and insolence. Four cutlasses
were, however, thrown into the boat at the last moment, and in this
miserable situation we set out for the island of Tofoa, one of the
Friendly Islands, ten leagues distant from where the ship then was.
This island we reached at seven o'clock the same evening, but the
shore being very steep and rocky, we could find no chance of
landing till the following day.<br>
<br></p>

<p>During our search for water at this island we were attacked by
the savages and barely escaped with our lives, one of our number,
John Norton, a quartermaster, being killed as he attempted to
recover the launch's grapnel.<br>
<br></p>

<p>After considering our melancholy situation, I was earnestly
solicited by all hands to take them toward home; and when I told
them that no hope of relief remained for us until we came to Timor,
a distance of 1200 leagues, they all agreed to live upon one ounce
of bread per man each day, and one gill of water. Therefore, after
recommending this promise forever to their memory, I bore away for
New Holland and Timor, across a sea but little known, and in a
small boat laden with 18 souls, without a single map of any kind,
and nothing but my own recollection and general knowledge of the
situation of places to direct us.<br>
<br></p>

<p>After enduring dangers and privations impossible to describe, we
sighted Timor on the 12th of June, and on the morning of the 15th,
before daylight, I anchored under the fort at the Dutch settlement
at Coupang. This voyage in an open boat I believe to be
unparalleled in the history of Navigation.<br>
<br></p>

<p>At Timor my boat's company were treated with the greatest
humanity by the Governor and the officers of the Dutch East India
Company. Here, for 1000 Rix dollars&mdash;for which I gave bills on
His Majesty's Government&mdash;I purchased a small schooner,
thirty-four feet long, which I fitted for sea under the name of His
Majesty's schooner, <i>Resource</i>. In this vessel we proceeded by
way of Surabaya and Samarang to the Dutch settlement of Batavia,
where I sold the <i>Resource</i> and, with my people, embarked for
Europe in ships of the Dutch East India Company.<br>
<br></p>

<p>The lists, which I herewith submit, of those who were cast
adrift with me in the launch and those who remained in the
<i>Bounty</i> will show the strength of the pirates.<br>
<br></p>

<p>I beg leave to inform their Lordships that the secrecy of the
mutiny was beyond all conception, so that I cannot discover that
any who were with me had the least knowledge of it.<br>
<br></p>

<p>It is of great importance to add that, on the night preceding
the mutiny, coming upon deck during the middle watch, according to
my custom, I discovered Fletcher Christian, the ringleader of the
pirates, in earnest conversation with Roger Byam, one of the
midshipmen. In the darkness of the deck I was not observed by these
men, who were standing on the starboard side of the quarter-deck
between the guns; nor had I any apprehension at that time that
their conversation was not innocent. But as I approached, unseen, I
saw Roger Byam shake hands with Christian, and I distinctly heard
him say these words: "You can count on me," to which Christian
replied:<br>
<br></p>

<p>"Good! That's settled, then." The moment they discovered me they
broke off their talk. I have not the slightest doubt that this
conversation concerned the forthcoming mutiny.</p></blockquote>

<p>A moment of deep silence followed the reading of Captain Bligh's
statement. I was conscious of the gaze of many pairs of eyes
directed upon me. No more damning statement could have been brought
forward, and it was only too plain how deep an impression it had
made upon the Court. How, without Tinkler's evidence, could it
possibly be refuted? A sense of the hopelessness of my situation
came over me. I knew that had I been in the place of any of my
judges, I should have felt certain of the guilt of at least one of
the prisoners.</p>

<p>The Judge Advocate asked: "Do you wish me to read the names on
the appended lists, my lord?"</p>

<p>Lord Hood nodded. "Proceed," he said.</p>

<p>The lists were then read&mdash;first the names of those who had
gone in the launch with Bligh, then of those who remained with
Christian's party. One thing that astonished me was Bligh's silence
with respect to Coleman, Norman, and McIntosh. He well knew of
their desire to go with him in the launch, and that they had been
prevented from doing so by the mutineers. The barest justice
demanded that he should have acknowledged their innocence; yet he
made no distinction between them and the guiltiest members of
Christian's party. To this day I am unable to account for his
injustice to these men.</p>

<p>John Fryer, master of the <i>Bounty</i>, was now called. He had
not changed in the least since I had last seen him, on the morning
of the mutiny. He glanced quickly in our direction, but there was
time for no more than a glance. He was directed to stand at the end
of the table, opposite Lord Hood, and was sworn.</p>

<p>The Court said: "Inform the Court of all the circumstances
within your knowledge concerning the running away with His
Majesty's ship, <i>Bounty</i>."</p>

<p>I shall give Fryer's testimony with few omissions, for it
provides a clear picture of what was seen by the <i>Bounty's</i>
master on the day of the mutiny.</p>

<p>"On the 28th of April, 1789, we tacked and stood to the
south'ard and westward until the island of Tofoa bore north; then
we steered west-northwest. In the first part of the evening we had
little wind. I had the first watch. The moon was at that time in
its first quarter. Between ten and eleven o'clock, Mr. Bligh came
on deck agreeable to his usual custom, to leave his orders for the
night. After he had been on deck some little time, I said, 'Sir, we
have got a moon coming on which will be fortunate for us when we
come on the coast of New Holland.' Mr. Bligh replied, 'Yes, Mr.
Fryer, so it will,' which was all the conversation that passed
between us. After leaving his orders, he went off the deck.</p>

<p>"At twelve o'clock everything was quiet on board. I was relieved
by Mr. Peckover, the gunner. Everything remained quiet until he was
relieved, at four o'clock, by Mr. Christian. At the dawn of day I
was much alarmed, whether from the noise Mr. Bligh said he made or
by the people coming into my cabin, I cannot tell. But when I
attempted to jump up, John Sumner and Matthew Quintal laid their
hands upon my breast and desired me to lie down, saying, 'You are a
prisoner, sir. Hold your tongue or you are a dead man, but if you
remain quiet, there is no person on board that will hurt a hair of
your head.'</p>

<p>"I then, by raising myself on the locker, which place I always
slept on for coolness, saw Mr. Bligh in his shirt, with his hands
tied behind him, going up the ladder, and Mr. Christian holding him
by the cord. The master-at-arms, Charles Churchill, then came to my
cabin and took a brace of pistols and a hangar, saying, 'I will
take care of these, Mr. Fryer.' I asked what they were going to do
with their captain. 'Damn his eyes!' Sumner said. 'Put him into the
boat and let the dog see if he can live on half a pound of yams a
day.' 'Into the boat!' I said. 'For God's sake, what for?' 'Sir,'
Quintal said, 'hold your tongue. Christian is captain of the ship,
and recollect that Mr. Bligh has brought all this upon
himself.'</p>

<p>"I then said, 'What boat are they going to put Captain Bligh
into?' They said, 'The large cutter: 'Good God!' I said, 'the
cutter's bottom is almost out of her, being very much eaten with
worms.' 'Damn his eyes,' Sumner and Quintal said, 'it is too good
for him even so!' I said, 'I hope they are not going to set Captain
Bligh adrift by himself?' They answered, 'No. Mr. Samuel, his
clerk, and Mr. Hayward and Mr. Hallet are going with him.'</p>

<p><a name="id05" id="id05"></a>"At last I prevailed on them to
call on deck to Christian to give me permission to go up, which,
after some hesitation, he granted. Mr. Bligh was standing by the
mizzenmast with his hands tied behind his back, and there were
several men guarding him. I said, 'Mr. Christian, consider what you
are about.' 'Hold your tongue, sir,' he replied. 'I have been in
hell for weeks past. Captain Bligh has brought all this on
himself.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Purcell, the carpenter, had been permitted to come on deck
at the same time with myself, and Mr. Christian now ordered him to
have the gear for the large cutter brought up. When we came to Mr.
Christian, Mr. Byam was talking with him. I said, 'Mr. Byam, surely
you are not concerned in this?' He appeared to be horrified at such
a thought. Mr. Christian said, 'No, Mr. Fryer, Mr. Byam has no hand
in this business.' I then said, 'Mr. Christian, I will stay with
the ship,' thinking that, if permitted to do so, a chance might
offer for retaking the vessel. Christian replied, 'No, Mr. Fryer,
you will go with Captain Bligh.' He then ordered Quintal, one of
the seamen under arms, to conduct me to my cabin while I collected
such things as I should need.</p>

<p>"At the hatchway I saw James Morrison, the boatswain's mate. I
said to him, 'Morrison, I hope you have no hand in this?' He
replied, 'No, sir, I have not.' 'If that's the case,' I replied, in
a low voice, 'be on your guard. There may be an opportunity for
recovering ourselves.' His answer was, 'I'm afraid it is too late,
Mr. Fryer.'</p>

<p>"I was then confined to my cabin, and a third sentinel was put
on, John Millward, who, I thought, seemed friendly. Mr. Peckover,
the gunner, and Mr. Nelson, the botanist, were confined in the
cockpit, to which place I persuaded the sentinels to let me go. Mr.
Nelson said, 'What is best to be done, Mr. Fryer?' I said to them,
'If we are ordered into the boat, say that you will stay on board,
and I flatter myself that we shall recover the ship in a short
time.' Mr. Peckover said, 'If we stay we shall all be deemed
pirates.' I told them not; that I would answer for them and
everyone that would join with me. At the time we were talking,
Henry Hillbrandt, the cooper, was in the bread room, getting some
bread to be put into the boat for Captain Bligh. I suppose he must
have heard our conversation and had gone on deck to tell Mr.
Christian, as I was immediately ordered up to my cabin. I heard
from the sentinels that Christian had consented to give Mr. Bligh
the launch, not for his own sake but for the safety of those who
were going with him. I asked if they knew who was to go with
Captain Bligh, and they said they believed a great many.</p>

<p>"Soon after this, Mr. Peckover, Mr. Nelson, and myself were
ordered upon deck. Captain Bligh was then at the gangway. He said,
'Mr. Fryer, stay with the ship.' 'No, by God!' Christian replied.
'Go into the boat or I will run you through,' pointing his bayonet
at my breast. I then asked Christian to permit Mr. Tinkler, my
brother-in-law, to go with me. Christian said, 'No,' but after much
solicitation he permitted him to go.</p>

<p>"I cannot say who was in the boat first, Mr. Bligh or myself;
however, we were both on the gangway together. All of this time
there was very bad language made use of by the people to Captain
Bligh. We begged that they would give us two or three muskets into
the boat, but they would not consent to it. The boat was then
ordered astern. After lying astern for some time, four cutlasses
were handed in, the people at the same time making use of very
abusive language. I heard several of them say, 'Shoot the dog!'
meaning Captain Bligh. Mr. Cole, the boatswain, said, 'We had
better cast off and take our chance, for they will certainly do us
a mischief if we stay much longer.' Captain Bligh very readily
agreed. There was little wind. We got out the oars and rowed
directly astern. Our reason for so doing was that we should sooner
be out of reach of the guns.</p>

<p>"As soon as the boat was cast off I heard Christian give orders
to loose the topgallant sails. They steered the same course as
Captain Bligh had ordered, and continued to do so for the time we
saw them.</p>

<p>"The confusion that prevailed on board was so great, and our
attention, from that time to our arrival at Timor, so much taken up
by regard for the preservation of our lives, that it was not
possible for me to make any note or memorandum, even if I had had
the means to do so, which I had not. This account is an exact
statement of the case to the best of my recollection.</p>

<p>"The following is the list of persons that I observed under
arms: Fletcher Christian, Charles Churchill, the master-at-arms,
Thomas Burkitt, one of the prisoners, Matthew Quintal, John
Millward, one of the prisoners, John Sumner and Isaac Martin.
Joseph Coleman, armourer, one of the prisoners, wished to come into
the boat and called several times to us to recollect that he had no
hand in the business. Charles Norman, one of the prisoners, and
Thomas McIntosh, another of the prisoners, also wished to come with
us, but were prevented by the mutineers, who had need of their
services on the ship. Michael Byrne, another of the prisoners,
wished, I think, to come with us as well, but feared to do so lest
the boat should be lost."</p>

<p>Fryer here ended his testimony.</p>

<p>The Court asked: "You have named seven persons who were under
arms. Did you believe that these were the only persons under
arms?"</p>

<p>Fryer: No.</p>

<p>The Court: What was your reason for so believing?</p>

<p>Fryer: From hearing the people in the boat say so, but I did not
see any more, to the best of my recollection.</p>

<p>The Court: Inform the Court of the time you remained on deck at
each of the times when you went on deck.</p>

<p>Fryer: About ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>The Court: When you were upon the quarter-deck, did you see any
of the prisoners active in obeying any orders from Christian or
Churchill?</p>

<p>Fryer: I saw Burkitt and Millward under arms as sentinels.</p>

<p>The Court: When the launch was veered astern, did you observe
any of the prisoners join in the bad language which you say passed
upon that occasion?</p>

<p>Fryer: Not to the best of my recollection. I saw Millward upon
the taffrail with a musket in his hand. There was so much noise and
confusion that I could not hear one man from another.</p>

<p>The Court: You also say that when the cutlasses were handed into
the boat, very bad language was used by the mutineers. Did any of
the prisoners join in it upon that occasion?</p>

<p>Fryer: Not to my recollection. It was a general thing among the
whole.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you see Thomas Ellison, one of the prisoners,
upon the morning of the mutiny?</p>

<p>Fryer: Not at first. Later I did.</p>

<p>The Court: What was he doing?</p>

<p>Fryer: He was standing near Captain Bligh, but I cannot charge
my memory as to what he was doing.</p>

<p>The Court: Did he have arms in his hands?</p>

<p>Fryer: I am not certain whether he had or no.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you see William Muspratt?</p>

<p>Fryer: No.</p>

<p>The Court: When Mr. Bligh and you were ordered into the boat,
did any person assist, or offer to assist Mr. Christian in putting
those orders into execution?</p>

<p>Fryer: Yes. Churchill, Sumner, Quintal, and Burkitt.</p>

<p>The Court: Were you near enough, when you heard Christian order
the topgallant sails to be loosed, to know any of the people who
went upon the yards?</p>

<p>Fryer: I saw only one, who was a boy at that time&mdash;Thomas
Ellison.</p>

<p>The Court: How many men did it require to hoist out the
launch?</p>

<p>Fryer: It might be done with ten men.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you see any of the prisoners assist in hoisting
her out?</p>

<p>Fryer: Yes. Mr. Byam, Mr. Morrison, Mr. Coleman, Norman and
McIntosh all assisted; but this was done at Mr. Cole's, the
boatswain's, orders, passed through him by Mr. Christian.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you consider these men as assisting the mutineers
or as assisting Captain Bligh?</p>

<p>Fryer: I considered them as assisting Captain Bligh, as giving
him a chance for his life.</p>

<p>The Court: What reason had you to imagine that John Millward was
friendly toward you at the time he was placed sentinel over
you?</p>

<p>Fryer: He appeared to be very uneasy in his mind, as though he
had taken arms reluctantly.</p>

<p>The Court: You say that you obtained permission for Tinkler to
join the boat with you. Had he been compelled to remain in the
ship?</p>

<p>Fryer: He had been told by Churchill that he was to stay aboard
to be his servant, and came to tell me in my cabin.</p>

<p>The Court: In what part of the ship were the youngsters
berthed?</p>

<p>Fryer: On the lower deck, on either side of the main
hatchway.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you observe whether there was a sentinel over the
main hatchway?</p>

<p>Fryer: Yes. I omitted to mention that Thompson was stationed
there by the arms chest, with a musket and a bayonet fixed.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you consider him to have been a sentinel over the
midshipmen's berth?</p>

<p>Fryer: Yes; over the berth and the arms chest at the same
time.</p>

<p>The Court: Do you know that, on that day, any effort was made by
any person in the ship to recover her?</p>

<p>Fryer: No.</p>

<p>The Court: What time elapsed from the first alarm to the time of
your being forced into the boat?</p>

<p>Fryer: About two hours and a half, or three hours, to the best
of my recollection.</p>

<p>The Court: What did you suppose to be Mr. Christian's meaning
when he said that he had been in hell for weeks past?</p>

<p>Fryer: I suppose he meant on account of the abuse he had
received from Captain Bligh.</p>

<p>The Court: Had there been any very recent quarrel?</p>

<p>Fryer: The day before the mutiny, Mr. Bligh charged Christian
with stealing his coconuts.</p>

<p>The prisoners were now permitted to question the witness, and I
was ordered to speak first. Fryer must have felt the strangeness of
our situation as much as did I, myself. He had been more than kind
to me during our long association on the <i>Bounty</i>, and to meet
for the first time since the mutiny under those circumstances, when
our conversation could be only of the most formal kind, was a
strain upon the self-control of both of us. I was certain that he
considered me as innocent as himself, and that he felt nothing but
good will toward me. I asked three questions.</p>

<p>Myself: When you came upon deck the first time, and found me in
conversation with Mr. Christian, did you overhear anything that was
said?</p>

<p>Fryer: No, Mr. Byam. There was...</p>

<p>Lord Hood interrupted.</p>

<p>"You must reply to the prisoner's questions by addressing the
Court," he said. The master therefore turned to the President.</p>

<p>Fryer: I cannot recollect that I overheard any of the
conversation.</p>

<p>Myself: Had you any reason to believe that I was a member of Mr.
Christian's party?</p>

<p>Fryer: None whatever.</p>

<p>Myself: If you had been permitted to remain in the ship, and had
you endeavoured to form a party to retake the vessel, would I have
been among those to whom you would have opened your mind?</p>

<p>Fryer: He would have been among the very first to whom I would
have spoken of the matter.</p>

<p>The Court: You say that you had no reason to believe Mr. Byam
member of Christian's party. Did you not consider the fact that
when you came upon deck he was in conversation with Mr. Christian a
suspicious circumstance?</p>

<p>Fryer: I did not; for Mr. Christian spoke to many of those,
during the mutiny, who were not members of his party.</p>

<p>The Court: During your watch, on the night before the mutiny,
did you observe Mr. Christian and the prisoner, Byam, together on
deck?</p>

<p>Fryer: No. To the best of my recollection, Mr. Byam was on deck
during the whole of my watch, and Mr. Christian did not appear at
all.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you speak to Mr. Byam at this time?</p>

<p>Fryer: Yes, upon several occasions.</p>

<p>The Court: Did he appear to be disturbed, or nervous, or anxious
in mind?</p>

<p>Fryer: Not in the least.</p>

<p>I felt deeply grateful to Fryer, not only for the matter of his
testimony concerning myself, but even more for the manner of it. It
must have been plain to all the Court that he considered me
innocent.</p>

<p>Morrison asked: "Did you observe any part of my conduct,
particularly on that day, which would lead you to believe that I
was one of the mutineers?"</p>

<p>Fryer: I did not.</p>

<p>The other prisoners questioned him in turn, and poor Burkitt
only made his case appear even worse than it had before, for Fryer
was obliged to repeat and enlarge upon the details of Burkitt's
activity as one of the mutineers.</p>

<p>The master then withdrew and Mr. Cole, the boatswain, was called
to the stand. His testimony necessarily covered much the same
ground; but while this was true in the case of each of the
witnesses, there were important points of difference in their
evidence. Each man had witnessed events from different parts of the
ship, and their interpretation of what they saw, as well as their
recollection of it after so long an interval of time, varied
considerably.</p>

<p>I learned from Cole's evidence that he had seen Stewart and me
dressing in the berth on the early morning of the mutiny, with
Churchill standing guard over us. His testimony was of melancholy
importance to Ellison, and the more damaging because of the evident
reluctance with which he gave it. Cole had a great liking for
Ellison, as had most of the ship's company. Nevertheless, being a
man of strict honesty and a high sense of duty, he was obliged to
say that he had seen Ellison acting as one of the guards over
Bligh. He passed lightly and quickly over the mention of his name,
hoping that the Court might not notice it. His evident struggle
between the desire to spare all of the prisoners as much as
possible, and the necessity for telling the truth, was apparent to
all, and won him the sympathy of the Court but no mercy. When he
had finished he was at once probed for further information
concerning Ellison.</p>

<p>The Court: You say that when you were allowed upon deck, you saw
the prisoner, Ellison, among the other armed men. How was he
armed?</p>

<p>Cole: With a bayonet.</p>

<p>The Court: Was he one of the guards over Captain Bligh?</p>

<p>Cole: Yes.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you hear the prisoner, Ellison, make any
remarks?</p>

<p>Cole: Yes.</p>

<p>The Court: What were they?</p>

<p>Cole: I heard him call Captain Bligh an old villain.</p>

<p>I then asked: "When you saw Stewart and me dressing in the
berth, with Churchill standing over us with a pistol, did you hear
any of the conversation that passed between us and Churchill and
Thompson?"</p>

<p>Cole: No, I heard nothing of the conversation. There was too
much noise and confusion.</p>

<p>Ellison: You say that I was armed with a bayonet, Mr. Cole. Did
you see me use it in any way?</p>

<p>Cole: By no means, lad. You...</p>

<p>"Address your replies to the Court."</p>

<p>Cole: He never once offered to use his bayonet. He merely
flourished it in Captain Bligh's face.</p>

<p>At this reply I saw the hint of a grim smile on the faces of
some of the members of the Court. Cole added, earnestly: "There was
no, real harm in this lad. He was only a boy at that time, and full
of mischief and high spirits."</p>

<p>The Court: Do you think this in any way excuses him for taking
part in a mutiny?</p>

<p>Cole: No, sir, but...</p>

<p>"That will do, Boatswain," Lord Hood interrupted. "Are there any
further questions from the prisoners?"</p>

<p>Morrison: Do you recollect, when I came on deck after you had
called me out of my hammock, that I came to you abaft the windlass
and said, 'Mr. Cole, what is to be done?' and that your answer was,
'By God, James, I do not know, but go and help them with the
cutter'?</p>

<p>Cole: Yes, I do remember it.</p>

<p>Morrison: Do you remember that, in consequence of your order, I
went about clearing the cutter? And afterward the launch, when Mr.
Christian ordered that boat to be hoisted out instead of the
cutter?</p>

<p>Cole: Yes.</p>

<p>Morrison: Do you remember that I brought a towline and grapnel
out of the main hold and put them into the launch? And do you
remember calling me to assist you to hoist a cask of water out of
the hold, and at the same time threatening John Norton, the
quartermaster, that he should not go in the boat if he was not more
attentive in getting things into her?</p>

<p>Cole: I have every reason to believe that he was employed in
this business under my direction. I remember telling Norton that,
for he was frightened out of his wits.</p>

<p>Morrison: Do you recollect that I assisted you when you were
getting your own things, which were tied up in part of your
bedding, into the boat?</p>

<p>Cole: I had forgotten this, but it is strictly true. I had no
reason at any time to suppose that he was concerned in the
mutiny.</p>

<p>Morrison: After I had helped you put your things into the boat,
did I not then run below to get my own, hoping to be allowed to go
with Captain Bligh?</p>

<p>Cole: I know that he went below, and I make no doubt that it was
for the purpose of getting his clothes to come with us.</p>

<p>The Court: Did the prisoner, Morrison, seem eager to go into the
boat?</p>

<p>Cole: None of us was eager, for we never expected to see England
again. But he was willing to go, and I make no doubt he would have
gone had there been room.</p>

<p>Burkitt then asked: "When you came aft to get the compass out of
the binnacle, did not Matthew Quintal come and say he would be
damned if you should have it? And you then said, 'Quintal, it is
very hard you'll not let us have a compass when there's plenty more
in the storeroom'? Then did you not look hard at me, and did I not
say, 'Quintal, let Mr. Cole have it, and anything else that will be
of service to him'?"</p>

<p>Cole: I know that Quintal objected to letting the compass go,
though I do not remember that Burkitt said anything, but he was
standing near by. The confusion was so great that it was impossible
I could take notice of everything particularly.</p>

<p>Burkitt: During the time that you say I was under arms, do you
recollect hearing me give any orders, or making use of bad
language?</p>

<p>Cole: I only observed that he was under arms.</p>

<p>Millward: Can you say whether I took a musket willingly, or only
because of Churchill's orders?</p>

<p>Cole: I do not know whether it was by Churchill's order or not.
He took the musket.</p>

<p>The Court: Were all the people who were put into the boat bound,
or were they at liberty in going into her?</p>

<p>Cole: They were not bound, but they marched them who were below
on deck with sentinels at different times.</p>

<p>The Court: Were there no other arms in the ship but those in the
arms chest in the main hatchway?</p>

<p>Cole: Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>The Court: At what time did day break on that morning?</p>

<p>Cole: I suppose about a quarter before five, or half-past
four.</p>

<p>The Court put many other questions to the boatswain beside those
given here. He was examined closely, as Fryer had been, concerning
the men in Christian's watch, those he saw under arms, my own
relationship with Christian, and the like. His evidence made it
plain that, although Morrison, Coleman, Norman, McIntosh, and
myself all assisted in hoisting out the launch, this was done at
the boatswain's orders, and could not be construed as evidence that
we were of the mutineers' party.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of Cole's testimony, the Court adjourned for
the day, and we were again conveyed to the gun room of the
<i>Hector</i>. Mr. Graham came, bringing a brief note from Sir
Joseph, which read: "Now you know the worst, Byam. Keep up a good
heart. Both Fryer and Cole have struck excellent blows for you
to-day. It is evident that their opinion of your character made an
impression upon the Court."</p>

<p>Mr. Graham talked with me for half an hour, going over the
evidence in detail, instructing me further as to the questions I
should ask of the witnesses yet to be heard. He refused to give an
opinion as to what he thought of my chances. "If you can, keep your
mind from dwelling upon the outcome," he said. "It is not my part
either to hearten or discourage you unduly, but I think it well
that you have no illusions about your situation. It is grave but
not hopeless. Meanwhile, be assured that I shall do everything in
my power to help you."</p>

<p>"May I ask one more question, Mr. Graham?" I said.</p>

<p>"Certainly. As many as you like."</p>

<p>"In your heart, do you believe me innocent or guilty?"</p>

<p>"I can answer that without a moment's hesitation. I believe you
innocent."</p>

<p>This heartened me greatly, and gave me reason to hope that some,
at least, of the members of the Court might feel as he did.</p>

<p>There was little conversation in the gun room that evening. As
long as daylight served, Morrison sat by a port, with his Bible on
his knee, reading aloud to Muspratt, who had requested this.
Ellison turned into his hammock early and was asleep within five
minutes. Four men among us had little to fear. The events of the
first day's hearing made it increasingly plain that Coleman,
Norman, McIntosh, and Byrne were all but certain of acquittal.
Burkitt and Millward paced up and down the room in their bare feet.
The soft padding of Burkitt's feet was the last sound I heard
before I went to sleep.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c22" id="c22"></a>CHAPTER XXII.&mdash;THE CASE FOR THE
CROWN</h2>

<p>At nine o'clock the following morning the hearing was resumed.
As we were marched into the great cabin I noticed that it was even
more closely packed with spectators than it had been the previous
day. The same solemnity marked the proceedings, and Court and
spectators alike attended the examination of the witnesses with the
same air of absorbed interest.</p>

<p>William Peckover, gunner of the <i>Bounty</i>, was called in and
sworn. The remarkable thing about his testimony was that he claimed
to have seen but four men under arms during the whole of the
mutiny&mdash;Christian, Burkitt, Sumner, and Quintal. I do not
believe that he deliberately falsified his testimony. I think he
must have reasoned in this way: "The mutiny took place so long ago,
how can I be certain as to whom I saw under arms? I have a clear
recollection of only four. The other lads shall have the benefit of
the doubt. God knows they need it!" Immediately he had finished, he
was questioned on this point.</p>

<p>The Court: How many people did the <i>Bounty's</i> company
consist of?</p>

<p>Peckover: Forty-three, I believe, at this time.</p>

<p>The Court: State again how many of those you saw under arms.</p>

<p>Peckover: Four.</p>

<p>The Court: Was it your opinion that four people took the ship
from nine and thirty?</p>

<p>Peckover: Not by any means.</p>

<p>The Court: Give your reasons for thinking so.</p>

<p>Peckover: There certainly must have been more concerned or they
would not have taken the ship from us. But these are all I can say,
positively, that I saw under arms.</p>

<p>The Court: What were your particular reasons for submitting when
you saw but four men under arms?</p>

<p>Peckover: I came naked upon the deck, with only my trousers on,
and there I saw Burkitt with a musket and a bayonet, and Mr.
Christian alongside of Captain Bligh, and a sentry at the gangway,
but who he was I do not remember.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you expostulate with Mr. Christian on his
conduct?</p>

<p>Peckover: I did not.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you see Mr. Byam that morning?</p>

<p>Peckover: Yes. I saw him standing by the booms talking with Mr.
Nelson, the botanist. Then he went below, and I did not again see
him until the launch had been ordered astern.</p>

<p>The Court: Where was he then?</p>

<p>Peckover: I saw him for a moment at the taffrail.</p>

<p>The Court: What are your reasons for believing that Coleman,
Norman, McIntosh, and Byrne were averse to the mutiny?</p>

<p>Peckover: When they were looking down upon us from the stern
they appeared to wish to come into the boat, what slight view I had
of them. I was busy stowing things in the boat, so that I remember
only Coleman calling to me.</p>

<p>The Court: You have said that, in talking with Mr. Purcell, he
said to you that he knew whose fault the business was, or words to
that effect. Do you apprehend that Mr. Purcell alluded to any of
the prisoners?</p>

<p>Peckover: No. I think he alluded to Captain Bligh, owing to the
abuse so many of the ship's company had received from him.</p>

<p>The Court: What was the nature of this abuse?</p>

<p>Peckover: Many severe punishments for slight offenses, and foul
and abusive language to all hands. Try as they would, neither
officers nor men could ever do anything to please him.</p>

<p>Morrison then questioned the gunner, and brought out even more
clearly, not only that he had never been under arms, but also that
he had done everything in his power to supply the launch with
provision and much-needed articles so that the men in her might
have a better chance for their lives. Morrison conducted his case
remarkably well. Unfortunately, the questions I put were to little
purpose. Peckover had been officer of the middle watch on the night
before the mutiny. He had seen Christian and me upon deck at that
time, but had heard nothing of our conversation; nor had he heard
any of the conversation that passed between Nelson and me the
following morning.</p>

<p>Purcell, the carpenter, next took the stand. He was the same
burly, heavy-jowled man whom I had heard say to Nelson on the
morning of the mutiny: "Stop aboard? With rogues and pirates?
Never, sir! I shall follow my commander." I had great respect for
the old fellow. No one could have hated Bligh more, but there was
never any hesitation in Purcell's decisions when it came to a
matter of duty. His evidence was of great importance to me, but
whether it helped or prejudiced my case it was difficult to say.
Purcell gave the names of seventeen men whom, he stated with
conviction, he had seen armed; among them, Ellison, Burkitt, and
Millward. Muspratt he omitted to name.</p>

<p>The Court asked: "In the former part of your evidence you say
that you asked Mr. Byam to intercede with Christian for the launch
instead of the cutter. Why did you speak of this matter to Byam?
Did you consider him one of the mutineers?"</p>

<p>Purcell: By no means. But I knew him to be a friend of Mr.
Christian. I also knew that Christian had no liking for me and
would have listened to no request I might have made.</p>

<p>The Court: Do you believe that it was owing to the prisoner
Byam's intercession that Christian permitted the launch to be
hoisted out instead of the cutter?</p>

<p>Purcell: Yes; and had we not been given the launch none of us
would ever have seen England again.</p>

<p>The Court: What had been the relations between Christian and
Byam throughout the voyage of the <i>Bounty</i> to Tahiti and
during the sojourn there?</p>

<p>Purcell: Most friendly.</p>

<p>The Court: Name any others whom you believe to have been
particularly friendly with Mr. Christian.</p>

<p>Purcell: Mr. Stewart was one. I can think of no others that I
could say were intimate with him. Mr. Christian was not an easy man
to know.</p>

<p>The Court: Do you think it likely that Mr. Christian would not
have divulged his plans for the mutiny to Mr. Byam, his most
intimate friend?</p>

<p>Purcell was taken aback by this question, put to him by Captain
Hammond, who sat on Lord Hood's right. He lowered his head like an
old bull at bay.</p>

<p>Purcell: Yes, I do think it likely. Mr. Christian was not a man
to involve his friends in trouble, and he must have known that Mr.
Byam would remain loyal to his commander.</p>

<p>The Court: Where was Byam just before the launch was veered
astern?</p>

<p>Purcell: I do not know. I had seen him upon deck a few moments
before, and he had told me of his intention to go with Captain
Bligh. I think he must have gone to the midshipmen's berth for his
clothes.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you see Morrison at this time?</p>

<p>Purcell: No.</p>

<p>The Court: Do you think it possible that the prisoners, Byam and
Morrison, may have feared to go into the boat and that they went
below to avoid the necessity of leaving the ship?</p>

<p>Purcell: No, I do not. They must have been prevented from
coming. They were not cowards as both Mr. Hayward and Mr. Hallet
were...</p>

<p>Lord Hood interrupted, sternly admonishing the carpenter to
reply only to the questions asked of him.</p>

<p>The Court: Putting every circumstance together, declare to this
Court, upon the oath you have taken, how you considered Mr. Byam's
behaviour, whether as a person joined in the mutiny or as a person
wishing well to Captain Bligh.</p>

<p>Purcell: I by no means considered him as a person concerned in
the mutiny.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you consider Morrison as a mutineer?</p>

<p>Purcell: I did not.</p>

<p>A pause followed. Lord Hood said: "The prisoners may now
question the witness."</p>

<p>Myself: How deep in the water was the launch when the last of
the people went into her?</p>

<p>Purcell: We had seven and one-half inches of freeboard,
amidships.</p>

<p>Myself: Do you think others might have come into her without
endangering the safety of all?</p>

<p>Purcell: Not one more could have entered her. Captain Bligh
himself begged that no more should be sent off. When we lost
Norton, the quartermaster, who was killed by the savages at Tofoa,
for all our regret at the poor fellow's death we were glad to have
the boat lightened of his weight. It gave the rest of us so much
more chance of life.</p>

<p>The following morning, Friday, September 14, Thomas Hayward gave
his evidence. We had awaited this most eagerly. Hayward was the
mate of Christian's watch and on deck at the time the mutiny
started. I, in particular, was curious to know whether his story
would corroborate the account given me by Christian on the day he
had called me into his cabin. Hayward made no mention whatever of
having been asleep on watch at the time the ship was seized. He
said that he was standing aft at that moment, looking over the side
at a shark, and that Christian had told him to oversee the vessel
while he went below to lash his hammock.</p>

<p>"A moment later," he went on, "to my unutterable surprise, I saw
Christian, Charles Churchill, Thomas Burkitt, one of the prisoners,
John Sumner, Matthew Quintal, William McCoy, Isaac Martin, Henry
Hillbrandt, and Alexander Smith coming aft, armed with muskets and
bayonets. On my going forward to prevent their proceedings, I asked
Christian the cause for such an act, and he told me to hold my
tongue, instantly. Martin was left as a sentinel on deck, and the
rest of the party proceeded to Mr. Bligh's cabin.</p>

<p>"I heard the cry of 'Murder!' from Mr. Bligh, and heard
Christian call for a rope. John Mills, contrary to all orders, cut
the deep-sea line and carried a piece of it to them. Thomas
Ellison, who was at the helm, quitted it and armed himself with a
bayonet. The ship's decks now began to be thronged with men. I saw
George Stewart, James Morrison, one of the prisoners, and Roger
Byam, another of the prisoners, standing by the booms.</p>

<p>"As soon as the launch was out, John Samuel, the captain's
clerk, John Hallet, midshipman, and myself were ordered into her.
We requested time sufficient to collect a few clothes, which was
granted. About this time I spoke to either Stewart or Byam, I
cannot be positive which, but I think it was Byam. I told him to go
into the boat, but in my hurry I cannot remember to have received
an answer. When I came upon deck again I saw Ellison standing as
one of the sentries over Captain Bligh. We were then forced into
the boat. I remember hearing Robert Tinkler, who was not yet in the
launch, call out, 'Byam, for God's sake, hasten!' A moment later
Tinkler himself came into the launch. He was among the last to
enter. When we were towing astern of the ship, I saw the prisoners,
Byam and Morrison, standing at the taffrail among the other
mutineers. They seemed well content to be there. I remember hearing
Burkitt use very abusive language, and I distinctly heard Millward
jeering at Captain Bligh. This is all that I know of the mutiny in
His Majesty's ship <i>Bounty</i>."</p>

<p>The Court asked: "You say that Burkitt used very abusive
language while the launch lay astern. To whom did it seem to be
addressed?"</p>

<p>Hayward: To the boat's people generally, I should say.</p>

<p>The Court: Can you recall what Millward said when he jeered at
Captain Bligh?</p>

<p>Hayward: Yes, precisely. He said, "You bloody villain! See if
you can live on half a pound of yams a day."</p>

<p>The Court: What number of armed men did you perceive on the
<i>Bounty</i> on the morning of the mutiny?</p>

<p>Hayward: Eighteen.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you hear any of the conversation that passed
between Christian and Byam with respect to having the launch in the
place of the cutter?</p>

<p>Hayward: No.</p>

<p>The Court: Were you on deck during the middle watch on the night
before the mutiny?</p>

<p>Hayward: No.</p>

<p>The Court: Do you know at what time the prisoner, Byam, came
down to the berth on that night?</p>

<p>Hayward: Yes. I chanced to be awake at that time and I heard the
ship's bell strike half-past one.</p>

<p>The Court: How do you know that it was Byam who came in?</p>

<p>Hayward: His hammock was next to mine on the larboard side of
the berth.</p>

<p>The Court: Relate everything you remember with respect to
Morrison.</p>

<p>Hayward: I remember seeing Morrison assisting to clear the yams
and other supplies out of the launch before she was hoisted out,
but I am doubtful whether he was at first under arms or not.</p>

<p>The Court: Do you mean by this that he was later under arms?</p>

<p>Hayward: I believe that he was, but I cannot say positively.</p>

<p>The Court: Did he appear to you, by his conduct, to be assisting
the mutineers, or was he merely obeying the orders that were given
to get the boat out?</p>

<p>Hayward: If I were to give it as my opinion, I should say that
he was assisting the mutineers. He perhaps might wish to get the
boat out to get quit of us as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The Court: Relate all you know of Ellison.</p>

<p>Hayward: Ellison was at the helm at the outbreak of the mutiny.
Soon after the people had gone below to secure Captain Bligh,
quitted the helm and armed himself with a bayonet. Before going
into the boat I saw him as a sentinel over Captain Bligh, and I
remember him saying, "Damn him, I will be sentinel over him!"</p>

<p>The Court: Relate all you remember of Muspratt.</p>

<p>Hayward: I remember seeing Muspratt on the larboard side of the
waist with a musket in his hand.</p>

<p>The Court: Relate all you remember of Burkitt.</p>

<p>Hayward: I saw Thomas Burkitt come aft, following Christian and
Churchill when they went to Captain Bligh's cabin, and I saw him
descend the after ladder with them. He was armed with a musket and
a bayonet. After the launch was astern I saw him at the taffrail,
and heard him using very abusive language to us in the boat.</p>

<p>The Court: Relate what you remember of Millward.</p>

<p>Hayward: I saw him armed as one of the sentinels, and after the
boat was veered astern, I saw him at the taffrail, where he jeered
at Captain Bligh, as I have said.</p>

<p>The Court: Have you any reason to believe that the prisoner,
Byam, would have been prevented from going in the boat at the time
you did, had he desired to do so?</p>

<p>Hayward: No.</p>

<p>The Court: Where was he at the time the launch was veered
aft?</p>

<p>Hayward: I cannot say, but a moment later I saw him at the
taffrail, looking down at us with the other mutineers.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you hear him make any remarks at that time?</p>

<p>Hayward: I am doubtful whether I did or not.</p>

<p>The Court: You have given it as your opinion that Morrison was
assisting the mutineers so as to get Captain Bligh and his party
out of the ship as soon as possible. In the former part of your
evidence you have said that the prisoner, McIntosh, was also
assisting to hoist the launch out, and that you did not look upon
him as a mutineer. What is the reason for your thinking differently
of them?</p>

<p>Hayward: The difference was in the countenances of the two. The
countenance of Morrison seemed to be rejoiced and that of McIntosh
depressed.</p>

<p>Morrison then asked: "You say that you observed joy in my
countenance, and you have given it as your opinion that I was one
of the mutineers. Can you declare, before God and this Court, that
such evidence is not the result of a private pique?"</p>

<p>Hayward: No, it is not the result of a private pique. It is an
opinion I formed after quitting the ship, from the prisoners not
coming with us when they had as good an opportunity as the rest,
there being more boats than one.</p>

<p>Morrison: One of the boats, as you know, was badly eaten with
worms. Are you certain that we might have had the other?</p>

<p>Hayward: Not having been present at any conference among you, I
cannot say.</p>

<p>Morrison: Can you deny that you were present when Captain Bligh
begged that the boat might not be overloaded; and can you deny that
he said, "I'll do you justice, lads"?</p>

<p>Hayward: I was present at the time Mr. Bligh made such a
declaration, but understood it as respecting the clothes and other
heavy articles with which the boat was already too full.</p>

<p>Ellison now put a question which brought into this grimly
serious trial the only touch of humour that attended it.</p>

<p>Ellison: You know that Captain Bligh used these words: "Don't
let the boat be overloaded, lads. I'll do you justice." And you say
you think this alluded to the clothes and other heavy articles in
the launch. Do you honestly think that the words, "I'll do you
justice," alluded to the clothes? Or did they allude to Coleman,
McIntosh, Norman, Byrne, Mr. Stewart, Mr. Byam, and Mr. Morrison,
who would have gone in the launch if there had been room?</p>

<p>Ellison scored a point here, for us, not for himself. Even the
members of the Court maintained with difficulty their expressions
of dignified severity.</p>

<p>Hayward: If Captain Bligh made use of the words, "My lads," it
was to the people already in the boat and not to those in the
ship.</p>

<p>The Court: Your opinion, then, is that Captain Bligh was not
alluding to any of the people remaining in the ship?</p>

<p>Hayward, realizing that the Court itself considered his opinion
preposterous, then acknowledged that Bligh might have been
referring to those in the ship.</p>

<p>The malicious manner in which he had testified astonished me.
This was particularly true in his evidence concerning Morrison and
me. He must have known, in his heart, that we were as innocent as
himself; yet he lost no opportunity to throw what doubt he could
upon the purity of our intentions. Morrison he had never liked, and
this ill-will was heartily returned; but my relations with Hayward
on the <i>Bounty</i>, although never cordial, had not been
unfriendly. I had the clearest recollection of the events of the
mutiny. Hayward had never once spoken to me on that morning, and
Stewart had told me that he had only seen Hayward at a distance.
And yet Hayward had testified that he had told one or the other of
us to go into the boat. The true facts were that he was so
terrified throughout the whole of this time as to be ignorant of
what he did, or said. It was my opinion at the time of the
court-martial, and it is so still, that he arranged his
recollections of what had taken place so as to put his own actions
in the most favourable possible light. He was a man easily
dominated by others of stronger character, and I believe that his
long association with Captain Edwards, of the <i>Pandora</i>, who
considered all of us piratical scoundrels, had completely coloured
Hayward's own opinions.</p>

<p>John Hallet was called next. He was now in his twentieth year,
and I scarcely recognized the thin, frightened-looking boy I had
known on the <i>Bounty</i> in the grown man who stood before us. He
was dressed in a handsome lieutenant's uniform&mdash;a long-tailed
coat of bright blue, with white cuffs and lapels and gold anchor
buttons. He wore white silk breeches and stockings, and his black
pumps shone like mirrors. As he entered the great cabin he removed
his cocked hat and placed it under his arm, halting to make a
sweeping bow to the President as he did so. Upon taking the stand
he glanced at us with an air that said only too plainly: "You see
how I have risen in the world? And what are you? Pirates and
mutineers!"</p>

<p>His story was the briefest of any of those yet given, but it was
of grave importance to Morrison and myself. He stated with
conviction that when the launch was about to leave the
<i>Bounty</i>, he had seen Morrison at the taffrail, armed with a
musket. He also named Burkitt, Ellison, and Millward as having been
armed. His evidence with respect to myself came when he was being
questioned by various members of the Court.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you see Roger Byam on the morning of the
mutiny?</p>

<p>Hallet: I remember to have seen him once.</p>

<p>The Court: What was he doing at that time?</p>

<p>Hallet: He was on the platform on the larboard side, upon deck,
standing still and looking attentively toward Captain Bligh.</p>

<p>The Court: Was he armed?</p>

<p>Hallet: I cannot say that he was.</p>

<p>The Court: Had you any conversation with him?</p>

<p>Hallet: No.</p>

<p>The Court: Do you know whether he was or was not prevented from
coming into the boat?</p>

<p>Hallet: I do not know that he ever offered to go into the
boat.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you hear any person propose to him to go into the
boat?</p>

<p>Hallet: No.</p>

<p>The Court: Do you know any other particulars respecting him on
that day?</p>

<p>Hallet: While he was standing as I have before related, Captain
Bligh said something to him, but what, I did not hear; upon which
Byam laughed, and turned and walked away.</p>

<p>The Court: Relate all you know of the conduct of James Morrison
on that day.</p>

<p>Hallet: When I first saw him he was unarmed; but he shortly
afterward appeared under arms.</p>

<p>The Court: How was he armed?</p>

<p>Hallet: With a musket.</p>

<p>The Court: At what part of the ship was he when you saw him so
armed?</p>

<p>Hallet: It was when the boat was veered astern. He was leaning
over the taffrail, calling out in a jeering manner, "If my friends
inquire for me, tell them I am somewhere in the South Sea."</p>

<p>The Court: Relate all you know respecting Thomas Ellison.</p>

<p>Hallet: He appeared early under arms, and came up to me and
insolently said, "Mr. Hallet, you need not mind this. We are only
going to put the Captain on shore, and then you and the others may
return."</p>

<p>The Court: Describe to the Court the situation of Captain Bligh
when the prisoner, Byam, laughed and walked away, as you have
described.</p>

<p>Hallet: He was standing with his arms bound, Christian holding
the cord in one hand, and a bayonet to his breast with the
other.</p>

<p>Upon the advice of Mr. Graham, I refrained from questioning
Hallet at this time.</p>

<p>"This is the gravest accusation that has been made against you,"
he whispered, "excepting only Bligh's. Do not examine Hallet upon
it now. It will be best to wait until the Court hears your defense.
At that time you will have the opportunity to recall any of the
witnesses you choose."</p>

<p>Morrison asked: "You say that you saw me armed at the taffrail.
Can you declare, positively, before God and this Court, that it was
I and no other person whom you saw under arms?"</p>

<p>Hallet: I have declared it.</p>

<p>Morrison: You have sworn that I did jeeringly say, "Tell my
friends, if they inquire for me, that I am somewhere in the South
Sea." To whom did I address this sneering message?</p>

<p>Hallet: I did not remark that it was addressed to anyone in
particular.</p>

<p>Morrison: Do you remember that I did, personally, assist you to
haul one of your chests up the main hatchway, and whether or not I
was armed then?</p>

<p>Hallet: The circumstances concerning the chest I do not
remember. I have before said that I did not see you under arms till
after the launch had been veered astern.</p>

<p>The witness withdrew, and John Smith, who had been Captain
Bligh's servant, was called. He was the last witness, and the only
one of the <i>Bounty's</i> seamen who gave evidence. In fact, there
were only three of the able seamen of the <i>Bounty's</i> company,
John Smith, Thomas Hall, and Robert Lamb, who had not been of
Christian's party; and of these both Lamb and Hall were dead.
Smith's evidence was not of importance to any of us who were before
the Court. He testified that, at Christian's orders, he had served
out rum to all those under arms; also that he had gone to Captain
Bligh's cabin to fetch up his clothes and other articles which were
put into the launch.</p>

<p>This concluded the evidence given by members of the
<i>Bounty's</i> company who went into the launch. Captain Edwards
and the lieutenants of the <i>Pandora</i> were then called in turn,
to testify as to the <i>Pandora's</i> sojourn at Tahiti when the
fourteen prisoners were taken. At the sight of Edwards and Parkin,
I was conscious of the same feeling of hot anger experienced how
many times during the dreary months when we were in their power.
Nevertheless, I must do them the justice to say that their evidence
as to the proceedings at Tahiti was scrupulously exact. Edwards
told how I had come off to the ship when she was still several
miles out at sea, explaining who I was and giving him exact
information with respect to the other <i>Bounty</i> men then on the
island. He also acknowledged that the other men had given
themselves up voluntarily. We should have liked to question him
with respect to the inhuman treatment we had received at his hands,
but this did not concern the mutiny, so we said nothing.</p>

<p>These were the last of the Crown witnesses, and the Court
adjourned until the following day, when we were to be heard in our
own defense.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c23" id="c23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.&mdash;THE
DEFENSE</h2>

<p>Being the only midshipman among the prisoners, I should, as a
matter of course, have been the first to be called for my defense;
but when the Court met on the Saturday morning, I requested, and
was granted, permission to defer presenting my case until Monday
morning. Coleman, whose acquittal was a foregone conclusion, was
ready to be heard, and was therefore called. His statement was
brief, and, having given it, he questioned Fryer, Cole, Peckover,
Purcell, and others, all of whom testified as to Coleman's
innocence, and that he had been detained in the <i>Bounty</i>
against his will. The Court then adjourned.</p>

<p>Nearly the whole of Sunday I spent with my advisor, Mr. Graham.
Captain Manly and Captain Bentham, advisors to the other prisoners,
came with him, and the three groups separated to various parts of
the gun room so as not to disturb one another.</p>

<p>I had already prepared, in writing, a rough copy of my defense.
Mr. Graham went over this with great care, pointing out various
omissions and making suggestions as to the arrangement of the
matter. He instructed me as to the witnesses I should call and
examine, after my defense had been read, and the questions I should
ask each one. Hayward had testified that he had been awake on the
night before the mutiny and had heard me come down to the berth at
half-past one.</p>

<p>"This evidence is of importance to you, Mr. Byam," Mr. Graham
said. "You have told me that Tinkler went down with you at that
time and that you bade each other good-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then Hayward must have heard you speak. We must see to it that
he acknowledges this. If we can prove that Tinkler was with you it
will bear out your account of the conversation with Christian,
which Tinkler overheard. Hallet struck you a heavy blow in saying
that you turned away laughing after Captain Bligh had spoken to
you."</p>

<p>"There was not a word of truth in the statement, sir," I said,
hotly.</p>

<p>"I am sure there was not. In my opinion neither Hayward nor
Hallet made a favourable impression upon the Court. But their
evidence cannot be disregarded. Together, it is enough to condemn
Morrison; his situation now is much more grave than it was. Did you
have an opportunity to observe the actions of Hayward and Hallet on
the morning of the mutiny?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw them a number of times."</p>

<p>"What can you say of them? Were they cool and
self-possessed?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary, they were both frightened out of their wits
the whole time, and both were crying and begging for mercy when
they were ordered into the launch."</p>

<p>"It is extremely important that you should bring this out. When
you question the other <i>Bounty</i> witnesses, you must examine
each of them upon this point. If they agree with you, that Hallet
and Hayward were much alarmed, it will throw doubt upon the
reliability of their testimony."</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when Mr. Graham rose to go.</p>

<p>"I think we have covered everything, Mr. Byam," he said. "Do you
wish to read your defense, or would you prefer that I read it for
you?"</p>

<p>"What do you think I should do, sir?"</p>

<p>"I advise you to read it, unless you think you may be too
nervous." I told him that I had no apprehensions on that score.</p>

<p>"Good!" he replied. "Your story will make a deeper impression if
given in your own voice. Read it clearly and slowly. You must have
noticed that several members of the Court seem to be all but
convinced of your guilt? It is apparent in the questions they have
asked the witnesses."</p>

<p>"I have noticed it, sir."</p>

<p>"I suggest that, as you read, you keep these particular men in
mind. If you do this the manner of your reading will take care of
itself. It is unnecessary to remind you that you are fighting for
your life. This is certain to make your words sufficiently
impressive."</p>

<p>By this time the advisors to the other prisoners had completed
their work, and they left the <i>Hector</i> with Mr. Graham. No
day, in all the interminable months we had passed as prisoners, had
slipped by so quickly as this one.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, September 17, the solitary gun boomed from
the <i>Duke</i>, the signal for assembling the court-martial. We
were conveyed on board with the usual guard of marines, and arrived
a good half-hour before the opening of the Court. Although I had
told Mr. Graham that he need have no fears about my coolness, I
felt anything but self-possessed as the minutes slowly passed. As
we were marched across the quarter-deck, I caught a glimpse of Sir
Joseph and Dr. Hamilton among the crowd of officers and civilians
waiting there. I dreaded that daily ordeal of mounting the gangway
of the <i>Duke</i>, and the march, two by two, along the deck to
the great cabin. We were objects of curiosity to everyone, and many
of the officers stared at us as though we were wild animals. At
least, so it seemed to me, but no doubt I was unusually sensitive
at that time, and imagined insolence and hostility on faces which
revealed nothing more than natural curiosity.</p>

<p>A few minutes before nine the spectators were all in their
places, and on the stroke of the hour the members of the Court
filed in. All in the room rose and remained standing until Lord
Hood and the other officers had taken their places.</p>

<p>A moment of silence followed; then the master-at-arms called:
"Roger Byam, stand forth!"</p>

<p>I rose and waited, facing Lord Hood.</p>

<p>"You have been accused, with others, of the mutinous and
piratical seizure of His Majesty's armed vessel, <i>Bounty</i>. You
have heard the Crown's witnesses. The Court is now ready to receive
whatever you may have to say in your own defense. Are you
prepared?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Raise your right hand."</p>

<p>I was then sworn, and I remember how my hand trembled as I held
it up. I looked toward Sir Joseph for comfort, but he sat with his
hands clasped around his knee, gazing straight before him. The
Court waited for me to proceed. For a moment, panic seized me. The
eyes of everyone in the room were turned toward me, and their faces
became a blur before my own. Then, as though it were someone else,
a long distance away, I heard my own voice speaking:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord, and gentlemen of this Honourable Court: The crime of
mutiny, for which I am now arraigned, is one of so grave a nature
as to awake the horror and indignation of all men, and he who
stands accused of it must appear an object of unpardonable
guilt.</p>

<p>"In such a character it is my misfortune to appear before this
Tribunal. I realize that appearances are against me, but they are
appearances only, and I declare before God and the members of this
Court that I am innocent; that I have never been guilty, either in
thought or in deed, of the crime with which I am charged."</p>

<p>Once I was fairly started, I regained my self-control, and,
bearing in mind Mr. Graham's advice, I read on, slowly and
deliberately. I explained fully the conversation with Christian on
the night before the mutiny, showing that it had nothing to do with
that event. I then told the story of the ship's seizure as it
concerned myself. I told of my conversation with Mr. Purcell and
Mr. Nelson, both of whom knew that I meant to leave the ship. I
told of going below, at the same time with Mr. Nelson, to fetch my
clothes, preparatory to going into the launch, and how, in the
midshipmen's berth, an opportunity seemed to present itself for
seizing the arms chest from Thompson. I told how Morrison and I,
with Friendly Island war clubs in our hands, waited for a chance to
attack Thompson, and how that chance was thwarted; and how Morrison
and I then rushed upon deck, only to find that we were too late to
go with Captain Bligh.</p>

<p>"My lord and gentlemen," I concluded, "it is a heavy misfortune
for me that the three men are dead whose evidence would prove,
beyond all doubt, the truth of what I say. John Norton, the
quartermaster, who knew of Christian's intention to leave the
<i>Bounty</i> on the night before the mutiny, and who prepared for
him the small raft upon which Christian meant to embark, is dead.
Mr. Nelson died at Batavia; and Robert Tinkler, who overheard all
of my conversation with Christian, has been lost at sea with the
vessel upon which he was serving. Fortune, I realize, has been
against me. Lacking the evidence of these three men, I can only
say, I entreat you to believe me! My good name is as precious to me
as life itself, and I beg of you, my lord and gentlemen, to
consider the situation in which I am placed; to remember that I
lack those witnesses whose evidence would, I am certain, convince
you of the truth of every statement I have made.</p>

<p>"To the mercy of this Honourable Court I now commit myself."</p>

<p>It was impossible to guess how my words had impressed the Court.
Lord Hood sat with his chin propped upon one hand, listening with
grave attention. I glanced hastily at the others. Two or three of
them were making memoranda of points in my story. One captain, with
a long cadaverous face, sat with eyes lowered, and one might have
thought him asleep. I had observed him before. He had maintained
the same position throughout the hearing, and the same air of
apparent inattention; but he was among the keenest of the
questioners. No point that might throw light upon the events of the
mutiny, or the trustworthiness of the witnesses, escaped him. He
addressed his questions without lifting his eyes, as though he had
the witness pinned down to the table between his elbows.</p>

<p>Another of the captains whom I feared most sat on Lord Hood's
left, the farthest from him on that side, and the nearest to the
stand for the witnesses. Hour after hour he sat as rigid as though
he were made of bronze. Once he had taken his seat at the table,
only his eyes were permitted freedom of movement; his glances were
keen and swift, like the thrust of a rapier. When I had finished,
the eyes of this latter captain were directed upon me for a moment,
and, brief as the glance had been, it chilled me to the heart. I
again recalled what Dr. Hamilton had said at the time of our first
conversation on the <i>Pandora</i>: "There is not one of those
captains who will not say to himself, 'This is such a tale as one
would expect an intelligent midshipman, eager to save his life, to
invent.'"</p>

<p>It seemed to me, judging by the faces of the men before me,
that, with the exception of Captain Montague, each of them was
thinking those very words. I felt utterly weary, physically and
spiritually. Then I saw Sir Joseph looking straight at me in his
kindly, heartening manner, as much as to say: "Well done, my lad!
Never say die!" His glance gave me new reserves of strength and
courage.</p>

<p>"My lord," I said, "may I now call what witnesses are available
to me?"</p>

<p>Lord Hood nodded. The master-at-arms went to the door and
called, "John Fryer! This way!"</p>

<p>The <i>Bounty's</i> master took the stand, was again sworn, and
awaited my questions.</p>

<p>Myself: What watch had I on the day of the mutiny?</p>

<p>Fryer: He was in my watch, the first watch of the preceding
evening.</p>

<p>Myself: Had you stayed in the ship, in the expectation of
retaking her, was my conduct, from the time when you first knew me
to this, in which you are to answer the question, such that you
would have entrusted me with your design, and do you believe that I
would have favoured it? (I had been instructed by Mr. Graham to ask
this question again.)</p>

<p>Fryer: I should not have hesitated in opening my design to him,
and I am sure that he would have favoured it.</p>

<p>Myself: Did you consider those people who assisted in hoisting
out the launch as helping Captain Bligh or the mutineers?</p>

<p>Fryer: Those without arms, as assisting Captain Bligh.</p>

<p>Myself: How many men, including Captain Bligh, went into the
launch?</p>

<p>Fryer: Nineteen.</p>

<p>Myself: What height from the water was the gunwale of the launch
when she put off from the ship?</p>

<p>Fryer: Not more than eight inches, to the best of my knowledge
and remembrance.</p>

<p>Myself: Would the launch have carried more people?</p>

<p>Fryer: Not one more, in my opinion, without endangering the
lives of all who were in her.</p>

<p>Myself: Did you, at any time during the mutiny, see me
armed?</p>

<p>Fryer: No.</p>

<p>Myself: Did Captain Bligh speak to me at any time on the morning
of the mutiny?</p>

<p>Fryer: Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Myself: Did you observe, on that morning, that I was guilty at
any time of levity of conduct?</p>

<p>Fryer: I did not.</p>

<p>Myself: Did you see Mr. Hayward on deck during the time of the
mutiny?</p>

<p>Fryer: Yes; several times.</p>

<p>Myself: In what state was he? Did he appear to be composed, or
was he agitated and alarmed?</p>

<p>Fryer: He was greatly agitated and alarmed, and crying when he
was forced into the boat.</p>

<p>Myself: Did you see Mr. Hallet on that morning?</p>

<p>Fryer: Yes; upon several occasions.</p>

<p>Myself: In what state did he appear to be?</p>

<p>Fryer: He was greatly frightened and crying when he went into
the boat.</p>

<p>Myself: What was my general character on the <i>Bounty</i>?</p>

<p>Fryer: Excellent. To the best of my recollection he was held in
high esteem by everyone.</p>

<p>The Court asked: "After the launch had left the ship, and during
the voyage to Timor, was the subject of the mutiny often discussed
among you?"</p>

<p>Fryer: No, not often. Our sufferings were so great, and the
efforts necessary for the preservation of our lives so constant,
that we had little time or inclination to speak of the mutiny.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you, during that voyage, or at any time
thereafter, hear Captain Bligh refer to a conversation he had
overheard between Christian and the prisoner, Byam, which took
place in the middle watch on the night before the mutiny?</p>

<p>Fryer: I did not.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you, at any time, hear him refer to the prisoner,
Byam?</p>

<p>Fryer: Yes; upon more than one occasion.</p>

<p>The Court: Can you recall what he said?</p>

<p>Fryer: On the day of the mutiny, after the launch had been cast
off and we were rowing toward the island of Tofoa, I heard Mr.
Bligh say, referring to Mr. Byam, "He is an ungrateful scoundrel,
the worst of them all except Christian." He later repeated this
opinion several times, in much the same words.</p>

<p>The Court: Did anyone in the boat speak in Byam's defense?</p>

<p>Fryer: Yes, I did, as well as various others. But Captain Bligh
bade us hold our tongues. He would allow nothing to be said in Mr.
Byam's favour.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you at any time hear Robert Tinkler refer to a
conversation between Christian and Byam which took place in the
middle watch on the night before the mutiny?</p>

<p>Fryer: I cannot recall that I did.</p>

<p>The Court: Did Robert Tinkler ever speak in defense of Byam?</p>

<p>Fryer: Yes. He never believed him implicated in the mutiny. On
the occasion I have mentioned, when Captain Bligh first accused Mr.
Byam, Tinkler, forgetting himself, said, warmly: "He is not one of
the mutineers, sir. I would stake my life upon it!" Captain Bligh
silenced him instantly.</p>

<p>The Court: Robert Tinkler was your brother-in-law, was he
not?</p>

<p>Fryer: He was.</p>

<p>The Court: He has been lost at sea?</p>

<p>Fryer: He has been reported lost with his ship, the <i>Carib
Maid</i>, among or near the West Indies.</p>

<p>The Court: Were your relations with Captain Bligh cordial or the
reverse?</p>

<p>Fryer: They were far from cordial.</p>

<p>Cole, the boatswain, was summoned next, and was followed by Mr.
Purcell. I put to each of them the same questions I had asked of
the master, and they replied to them as he had done. The questions
asked by the members of the Court were much the same, and both men
were examined particularly as to whether either Bligh or Tinkler
had ever referred to my conversation with Christian, upon which the
fact of my guilt or innocence so strongly depended. Neither of them
could remember having heard any reference made to this
conversation. I had strongly hoped that Mr. Peckover, the gunner,
and officer of the middle watch, might have overheard something of
this conversation, but he could say only what further incriminated
me, that he had seen Christian and me in conversation on the
quarter-deck during that watch.</p>

<p>The Court asked: "At what time did you observe Christian and the
prisoner, Byam, in conversation?"</p>

<p>Peckover: It might have been at about one o'clock.</p>

<p>The Court: Was it the prisoner's, Byam's, custom to remain on
deck at night after the end of his watch?</p>

<p>Peckover: I cannot say that it was.</p>

<p>The Court: Was it Mr. Christian's habit to be much on deck at
night, when not on duty?</p>

<p>Peckover: No, not as a general thing, but it was not unusual for
him to come up at night to observe the state of the weather.</p>

<p>The Court: What, in your opinion, was their reason for remaining
so long on the deck on this particular night?</p>

<p>Peckover: I suppose they wished to enjoy the coolness of the
upper deck.</p>

<p>The Court: When Captain Bligh came on deck, during your watch,
what did he do?</p>

<p>Peckover: He paced up and down for a few moments.</p>

<p>The Court: Did Christian and the prisoner, Byam, perceive
him?</p>

<p>Peckover: I cannot say. The moon had set before that time and it
was dark upon deck.</p>

<p>The Court: Did Captain Bligh speak with Christian and Byam?</p>

<p>Peckover: I believe he did, but I did not hear what he said.</p>

<p>The Court: At what time did Byam go below to the berth?</p>

<p>Peckover: It may have been about half-past one.</p>

<p>The Court: Did Christian go below at that time?</p>

<p>Peckover: I cannot be certain. I believe he remained on
deck.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you, at any time during your watch on that night,
see John Norton, one of the quartermasters?</p>

<p>It was Sir George Montague, captain of the <i>Hector</i>, who
put this question. I do not know why it had not occurred to me to
ask it, or how Mr. Graham could have failed to suggest it to me.
The reason may have been that Norton, being dead, seemed as out of
the matter as Mr. Nelson himself, or any of the others who had
died. Immediately Captain Montague had spoken I realized how
important the question was.</p>

<p>Peckover: Yes; I saw Norton at about two o'clock.</p>

<p>The Court: Upon what occasion?</p>

<p>Peckover: I had heard the sound of hammering by the windlass,
and myself went forward to see what the cause of it was. I found
Norton at work upon something, and asked him what he was about at
that hour of the night. He told me that he was repairing a hencoop
for some fowls we had bought of the savages at Namuka.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you see at what work he was engaged?</p>

<p>Peckover: No, not clearly. It was quite dark, but I made no
doubt that he was engaged as he said.</p>

<p>The Court: Did you have any further conversation with him?</p>

<p>Peckover: I told him to leave off; that there was time enough
for making hencoops in the daytime.</p>

<p>The Court: Was not such work the business of the carpenters of
the <i>Bounty</i>?</p>

<p>Peckover: Yes; but it was not uncommon for Norton to assist them
when there was much carpenter's work to be done.</p>

<p>The Court: Had you ever known Norton to be so employed at night
before?</p>

<p>Peckover: Never before, that I can remember.</p>

<p>The Court: Do you think it might have been a small raft upon
which the quartermaster was working?</p>

<p>Peckover: Yes, it might have been. As I have said, it was dark
and I took no particular notice of what the object was.</p>

<p>The Court, particularly in the person of Captain Montague,
questioned the gunner carefully on this matter, but Peckover could
not remember that he had seen Christian and Norton in conversation
during that evening. Nevertheless, here was a ray of hope for
me&mdash;a bit of evidence, and the only one, to bear out my story
that Christian had intended to desert the ship during that night,
and that he had taken Norton into his confidence.</p>

<p>Hayward followed on the witness stand, but for all my
questioning he would not acknowledge that Tinkler had come down to
the berth with me on the night before the mutiny. And yet he must
have heard us bid each other good-night. At that time we were
standing within two paces of his hammock, and he had said that he
heard me come in. Hallet clung to his story that I had laughed and
turned away when, as he said, Captain Bligh spoke to me. But I
could see that his sullen, insolent manner of clinging to it had
made an unfavourable impression upon the Court.</p>

<p>My case rested here, and Morrison was next called for his
defense. He was cool and self-possessed. His story was perfectly
clear, well presented, and, I thought, wholly convincing. He
confirmed my story as to the reason we had been below at the time
the launch was veered astern. Of the witnesses he called, Fryer,
Cole, Purcell, and Peckover bore out all that he said, with the
exception of his reason for not being on deck in time to go with
the launch; for of this matter, of course, they could know nothing.
Hallet and Hayward were the only witnesses who had testified to
having seen him under arms, and he forced both of them to admit
that they might have been mistaken.</p>

<p>The Court adjourned for lunch. At one o'clock it reassembled,
and Norman, McIntosh, and Byrne were quickly heard. Their innocence
had already been clearly established and, advisedly, they had made
their pleas brief.</p>

<p>Burkitt, Millward, and Muspratt came next. The guilt of the
first two was so evident that little could be said in extenuation
of it. Both men had been willing mutineers from the beginning.</p>

<p>Ellison was the last to be heard. He had written his own
defense, and Captain Bentham let it stand as it was, believing that
the naive boyish way in which Ellison had explained his actions
would make the only appeal for clemency the poor lad could hope
for. I well remember the conclusion of his plea: "I hope,
honourable gentlemen, you'll be so kind as to take my case under
consideration, as I was only a boy at the time, and I leave myself
to the clemency and mercy of this Honourable Court."</p>

<p>By this time it was nearly 4 P.M. The Court adjourned, and we
were taken back to the <i>Hector</i> to await its verdict.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c24" id="c24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.&mdash;CONDEMNED</h2>

<p>Tuesday, the eighteenth of September, 1792, was a typically
English autumn day, with a grey sea and a grey sky. It had rained
during the early morning, but by the time the gun was fired from
the <i>Duke</i>, assembling the court-martial, the downpour had
changed to a light drizzle through which the many ships of war at
anchor could be seen dimly. At length the sky lightened
perceptibly, and the sun shone wanly through. The <i>Duke's</i>
quarter-deck was thronged with people awaiting the opening of the
Court. Sir Joseph and Dr. Hamilton were there. On the other side of
the deck were the <i>Bounty</i> witnesses and the officers of the
<i>Pandora</i>.</p>

<p>Throughout the court-martial no relatives or friends of the
prisoners had been permitted to attend the hearings. Even had such
permission been granted, now that my mother was dead, I had no
relatives who might have come. This was a consolation to me.
Whatever my fate, it was good to be certain that none of my kin was
waiting that morning for the verdict that would either clear me or
condemn me to death.</p>

<p>But as my glance went over the crowd my pulse quickened at
seeing Mr. Erskine, my father's solicitor and the old friend of
both of my parents. He was then well into his seventies. He had
stopped with us at Withycombe many a time, and the great treats of
my life, as a youngster, had been my rare visits to London with my
father, when I had seen much of Mr. Erskine. He had often taken me
to view the sights of London, and his kindnesses upon these
occasions made them among the happiest of my boyhood recollections.
For the first time since the beginning of the court-martial I was
deeply stirred, and I could see that Mr. Erskine controlled his own
emotion with difficulty. His association with my parents and
Withycombe was so close that he seemed like a near and deeply loved
relative.</p>

<p>Presently the door of the great cabin was opened and the
spectators filed in to their places. The prisoners followed, and we
stood waiting while the members of the Court took their seats. The
master-at-arms called, "Roger Byam!"</p>

<p>I stood in my place.</p>

<p>The President asked, "Have you anything further to say in your
defense?"</p>

<p>"No, my lord."</p>

<p>The same question was put to each of us. The spectators were
then asked to leave the room, the prisoners were marched out, and
the door of the great cabin closed behind us. We were taken into
the waist, by the foremast. The spectators stood in groups about
the quarter-deck, or walked up and down, talking together. We could
hear nothing they said; indeed, a silence seemed to have fallen
over the ship. There were seamen going about routine duties, but
they performed them in a subdued, soundless manner as though they
were officiating at church.</p>

<p>Mr. Graham had visited me on the previous evening. He had told
me how I might know, the moment I entered the room to learn my
fate, what that fate was to be. A midshipman's dirk would be lying
on the table before the President. If the dirk were placed at right
angles to me, I should know that I had been acquitted. If it lay
with the point toward the foot of the table where I was to stand, I
should know that I had been condemned.</p>

<p>I felt strangely indifferent as to which it might be. Presently
I fell into a kind of stupor, a waking dream, in which blurred
images passed over the surface of consciousness, stirring it but
little more than the ghost of a breeze disturbs the surface of a
calm sea.</p>

<p>It must have been at about half-past nine that the Court had
been cleared. When I roused myself from my reverie, an immeasurable
period of time seemed to have elapsed; and indeed, the sun had
passed the meridian. I heard the ship's bells strike one o'clock.
The clouds had vanished, the sky was pale blue, and the sunlight
had that golden quality which beautifies whatever it touches,
giving a kind of splendour to familiar, common objects. The
<i>Duke's</i> great guns looked magical in that light, and the
throng on the quarter-deck, in their varicoloured uniforms, with
sudden gleams of light flashing from epaulettes or sword hilts,
seemed like figures out of some romantic tale rather than officers
of His Majesty's Navy.</p>

<p>The door of the great cabin reopened at last. The master-at-arms
appeared, announcing that audience was admitted; then I heard my
name called. The sound of the syllables seemed strange to me; it
was as though I had never heard them before.</p>

<p>I was accompanied by a lieutenant with a drawn sword and a guard
of four men with muskets and bayonets fixed. I found myself
standing at the end of the long table, facing the President. The
midshipman's dirk was lying on the table before him. Its point was
toward me.</p>

<p>The entire Court rose. Lord Hood regarded me in silence for a
moment.</p>

<p>"Roger Byam: having heard the evidence produced in support of
the charges made against you; and having heard what you have
alleged in your own defense; and having maturely and deliberately
weighed the whole of the evidence, this Court is of the opinion
that the charges have been proved against you. It doth, therefore,
judge that you shall suffer death by being hanged by the neck on
board such of His Majesty's ships of war, and at such a time and
such a place as the Commissioners for executing the office of Lord
High Admiral of Great Britain and Ireland, or any three of them for
the time being, shall, in writing, under their hands, direct."</p>

<p>I waited, expecting to hear more, knowing at the same time that
there was nothing more to be said. Then a voice&mdash;whose, I do
not know&mdash;said, "The prisoner may retire." I turned about and
was marched out of the great cabin, back to where the others were
waiting.</p>

<p>I felt little emotion; only a sense of relief that the long
ordeal was over. A true conception of all the horror and ignominy
of this end was to come later. At the time sentence was pronounced
I was merely stunned and dazed by the finality of it. Evidently the
expression on my face told the others nothing, for Morrison asked,
"What is it, Byam?"</p>

<p>"I'm to be hung," I said, and I shall never forget the look of
horror on Morrison's face. He had no time to reply, for he was
called next. We watched as the door of the cabin closed behind him.
Coleman, Norman, McIntosh, and Byrne stood in a group, waiting
their turns, and I remember how the others drew closer to me, as
though for mutual protection and comfort. Ellison touched my arm
and smiled, without speaking. Burkitt stood clasping and unclasping
his huge hairy hands.</p>

<p>The door opened again and Morrison was marched back to us. His
face was pale, but he had himself well under control. He turned to
me with a bitter smile. "We must enjoy life while we can, Byam." A
moment later he added, "I wish to God <i>my</i> mother were
dead."</p>

<p>I felt a welcome surge of anger. Morrison had, unquestionably,
been convicted upon the evidence of two men, Hayward and Hallet.
They alone of the witnesses had testified to having seen him under
arms. Having heard the evidence of the other witnesses, I had never
for a moment doubted that Morrison's name would be cleared; nor, I
think, had he himself doubted. I could find nothing to say to
comfort him.</p>

<p>Coleman followed. When he came out of the courtroom again, the
guard stood to one side and Coleman walked, a free man, to one side
of the quarter-deck. Norman, McIntosh, and Byrne were escorted in
in turn, and as they came out the guard stood aside in each case,
and they joined Coleman. Byrne was sobbing with joy and relief. The
poor chap was almost blind, and groped his way to the others, his
hands outstretched and the tears streaming down his face. Although
their acquittal had been all but certain, now that they were
actually at liberty their dazed manner and their bewilderment as to
what to do with themselves would have touched any man's heart.</p>

<p>Burkitt, Ellison, Millward, and Muspratt were called in quick
succession. All were found guilty and condemned to death.
Immediately after sentence had been pronounced upon Muspratt, the
spectators came out into the sunshine of the quarter-deck. We
expected to see the members of the Court follow, but when the room
had been cleared the door was closed again. Something, evidently,
was to follow. The strain of waiting during the next half-hour was
hardly to be borne.</p>

<p>Audience was again admitted, and the master-at-arms appeared at
the door.</p>

<p>"James Morrison!"</p>

<p>Again Morrison was marched in. When he returned, he came as near
to giving way to his emotion as I had ever seen him do. He had been
recommended to His Majesty's mercy. This meant, almost certainly,
that the recommendation of the Court would be followed and Morrison
pardoned. A moment later Lord Hood came out, followed by the
captains who had sat with him. The court-martial was at an end.</p>

<p>Muspratt looked at me in such a desolate manner that my heart
went out to him. I put my hand on his shoulder, but there was
nothing to be said. In the silence of the ship, I could hear the
faint hum of conversation from the quarter-deck. I saw Sir Joseph,
Mr. Erskine, and Dr. Hamilton standing together by the larboard
bulwarks. They were not permitted to come to us at that time, a
circumstance for which I was deeply grateful.</p>

<p>Mercifully, we were not compelled to wait long on the
<i>Duke</i>. The guard was drawn up; we were escorted to the
gangway and clambered down the side into the longboat waiting to
convey us back to the <i>Hector</i>. Another boat was lying
alongside. There were no marines in her&mdash;only six seamen at
the oars. Directly we had pushed off, we saw the freed men
descending the side to be taken ashore. We had no opportunity to
bid them good-bye and Godspeed, and when their boat put off from
the side of the <i>Duke</i>, ours had almost reached the
<i>Hector</i>. Ellison stood and waved his hat, and they waved back
as they passed around the <i>Duke</i> and turned toward the shore.
A moment later they were cut off from view. I never saw any man of
them again.</p>

<p>During the whole time of our confinement on board the
<i>Hector</i> we had been treated with great kindness by Captain
Montague. We were, of course, carefully guarded, with marines
stationed in the gun room as well as outside the door, but aside
from that there had been little to remind us of the fact that we
were prisoners. Now that we had been condemned and were awaiting
execution of sentence, Captain Montague did all he could to make
our situation endurable. He granted me the privilege of being
confined in a cabin belonging to one of his lieutenants who was
absent on leave. After eighteen months of imprisonment, during
which time I had had not a moment of privacy, I was able to
appreciate this courtesy at its full value. Twice daily I was
permitted to go to the gun room for the purpose of exercise and to
see the others.</p>

<p>Sir Joseph Banks, the most considerate of men, did not come to
see me until the second day after we had been condemned, so that
when he did come, late in the afternoon, I was prepared to meet
him. I was then most eager to see him, and when I opened the door
of my cabin to find him standing there, my heart leaped with
pleasure.</p>

<p>He gripped my hand in both of his, then turned to take a bulky
parcel from the seaman who had brought him to the cabin.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Byam," he said. He laid the parcel on the small table
and proceeded to remove the wrappings.</p>

<p>"I've brought you an old companion and friend. Do you recognize
it?" he added, as he laid aside the last of the wrappings. It was
the manuscript of my Tahitian dictionary and grammar.</p>

<p>"Allow me to say this," he went on. "I have gone over your
manuscripts with great interest, and I know enough of the Tahitian
language to appreciate the quality of the work you've done. It is
excellent, Byam; precisely what is needed. This book, when it is
published, will be of great value, not only practically but
philosophically. Now tell me this: how much time would you require
to put it into final shape, ready for the printers?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean that I may work on it here?"</p>

<p>"Would you care to do so?"</p>

<p>I was in need, heaven knows, of something to occupy my mind. Sir
Joseph's thoughtfulness touched me deeply.</p>

<p>"Nothing would please me more, sir," I replied. "I am under no
illusions as to the importance of this work..."</p>

<p>"But it is important, my dear fellow," he interrupted. "Make no
mistake about that. I've brought your manuscripts not merely out of
consideration for you. This task must be completed. The Royal
Society is greatly interested, and it has been suggested to me that
an introductory essay accompany the volume, in which the Tahitian
language shall be discussed generally, and its points of difference
to any of our European tongues pointed out. Such an essay is quite
beyond me. I had only a superficial knowledge of the Tahitian
speech, acquired during my sojourn on the island with Captain Cook,
and I have forgotten most of what I learned at that time. Only you
can write this essay."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to attempt it," I replied, "if there is
sufficient time..."</p>

<p>"Could you complete it in a month?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"Then a clear month you shall have. I have enough influence at
the Admiralty to be able to promise you that."</p>

<p>"I shall make the most of it, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you prefer not to talk of the events of the...of the past
week?" he asked, after a brief silence.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter, sir. If there is something you wish to
say..."</p>

<p>"Only this, Byam. It is needless to tell you what my feelings
are. There has never been a more tragic miscarriage of justice in
the history of His Majesty's Navy. I know how embittered you must
be. You understand why you have been condemned?"</p>

<p>"I believe I do, sir."</p>

<p>"There was no alternative, Byam. None. All the palliating
circumstances&mdash;the fact that no man had seen you under arms,
the testimony as to the excellent character you bore, and all the
rest&mdash;were not sufficient to offset Bligh's damning statement
as to your complicity with Christian in planning the mutiny. That
statement stood unchallenged, except by yourself, throughout the
court-martial. Only your friend Tinkler could have challenged and
disproved it. Lacking his evidence..."</p>

<p>"I understand, sir," I replied. "Let us say no more about it.
What seems to me not only a tragic but a needless miscarriage of
justice applies to poor Muspratt. There is no more loyal-hearted
seaman afloat than Muspratt, and he is to be hung solely upon the
evidence of one man&mdash;Hayward. Muspratt's testimony as to why
he took arms is strictly true. It was for the purpose of helping
Fryer in case he was able to form a party for retaking the ship.
The instant he saw that the party could not be formed, he put down
the musket."</p>

<p>"I agree with you, and you will be glad to know that there is
still hope for Muspratt. Say nothing, of course, to the poor fellow
about this, but I have it upon good authority that he may yet be
reprieved."</p>

<p>That same afternoon, when I saw Muspratt in the gun room, I was
tempted, for the first time in my life, to betray a matter
entrusted to me in confidence. It would be impossible to say how
badly I wanted to give Muspratt a glimmer of hope, the merest hint
of what might happen in his case. I refrained, however.</p>

<p>Those September days were as beautiful as any that I remember. A
transparent film of vapour hung high in the air, diffusing the
light of the sun, so that the very atmosphere seemed to be composed
of a golden dust transforming every object it fell upon. So it was,
day after day, without change. The <i>Hector</i> was moored, bow
and stern, and the view from my cabin was always the same, but I
never tired of it. I had a prospect of the harbour looking toward
the Channel and the Isle of Wight, with a great first-rate and
three seventy-fours anchored not far distant. I saw boats passing
back and forth, their oars dipped in gold, and the men in them
seemed transfigured in the pale light. Knowing how brief a time
remained to me, I found nothing unworthy of interest and attention.
Even the common objects in my small cabin,&mdash;the locker, the
table, and the inkwell before me,&mdash;seen in various lights at
different hours of the day, I found beautiful and wondered that I
had failed to notice such things before.</p>

<p>I was not wholly wretched at this time. A man who knows that he
is to die, that his fate is fixed and irrevocable, seems to be
endowed, as a recompense, with the faculty of benumbed
acquiescence. The thing is there, slowly or swiftly approaching,
but for the most part he is mercifully spared the full realization
that it must and will come. There are moments, however, when he is
not spared. Now and then, particularly at night, I would be gripped
by a sense of horror that struck me to the heart. I would feel the
rope about my throat, and see the faces of the brawny seamen who
were waiting the order to hoist me to the yardarm; and I would hear
the last words that would ever strike my ear: "And may God have
mercy upon you." At such times I would pray silently for the
courage to meet that moment when it should come.</p>

<p>Of the other condemned men, Ellison best endured the cruel
waiting. He had lost his old gaiety of manner, but it was replaced
by a quiet courage to face the facts that was beyond praise.
Burkitt became more and more like a wild beast at bay. Every time
that I was taken to the gun room for exercise I would find him
pacing up and down, turning his head from side to side with the
same expression of dazed incredulity on his face. He had the mighty
chest of a Viking and his limbs would have made those of three
ordinary men. He had never known an ache or a pain in his life save
those inflicted by some boatswain's mate with a cat-o'-nine-tails.
To men with such a power of life in them, death has no reality
until it is at hand. Even now, I could see that Burkitt had not
entirely given up hope. There was always the possibility of escape.
He was narrowly watched by the guards; the eyes of one or another
of them were upon him constantly.</p>

<p>Millward and Muspratt were sunk in moods of hopeless apathy, and
rarely spoke to anyone. No one knew on what day the execution would
be carried out. Not even the captain of the <i>Hector</i> would
know until the Admiralty order had been received. Meanwhile,
Morrison was kept in a state of what would have been, for me, the
most harrowing anxiety. Although recommended to the King's
clemency, there was always the possibility that mercy would be
refused. The days passed and no pardon came, but Morrison was his
usual calm self, and he discussed my work on the dictionary as
though he had no other interest in the world. Had he been condemned
to die with the rest of us, Morrison would have awaited the ordeal
with the same fortitude.</p>

<p>Mr. Graham came to bid me farewell before leaving Portsmouth. He
told me, as Sir Joseph had done, that the Court had no alternative
in imposing sentence upon me; and, although he did not say so
directly, he gave me to understand that I could not hope for a
reprieve. The following afternoon Mr. Erskine came, remaining until
dusk, during which time I settled my affairs and made my will. My
only living relative was a cousin on my mother's side, a lad of
fifteen who lived in India with his father. It was strange to think
that our old home at Withycombe and the rest of our family fortune
would go to this boy whom I had never seen.</p>

<p>I shall not venture to say how I would have passed those days
without work to engross my thoughts. Once again my dictionary
proved to be the greatest of blessings, and it was not long before
I was able to give it the whole of my attention. Every one of those
manuscript pages was fragrant with Tahiti and memories of Tehani
and our little Helen. Some of them the baby had torn or
finger-marked, and I could plainly hear her mother's voice as she
took them quickly from her, scolding her lovingly: "Oh, you little
mischief! Is this the way you help your father?"</p>

<p>Scarcely a word but brought memories thronging back.
"Tafano"&mdash;I well remembered the circumstances which added that
to my lexicon. The sweet poignant odour of the flower seemed to
rise from the page where I had written it, and I lived again the
happy day that Stewart and Peggy and Tehani and I had spent on the
little island in the Tautira lagoon.</p>

<p>I worked all day long, and every day, and by the middle of
October my task was completed, in so far as the dictionary and
grammar were concerned. I proceeded at once to write the
introductory essay, for I knew that the time remaining to me must
be short.</p>

<p>The strain of waiting was telling upon all of us. Although he
failed to show it, Morrison must have found it hardest to bear. To
me, it seemed the refinement of cruelty to keep him so long in
doubt as to his fate. A month had passed, and still he received no
word.</p>

<p>I had received several letters from Sir Joseph, but there was no
mention of Admiralty news; nor did I expect any. He himself would
not know the day set for the execution.</p>

<p>On the twenty-fifth of October, I was revising, for the fourth
or fifth time, the introductory essay for my dictionary, when there
came a knock at the door. Every summons of this sort brought a cold
sweat to my forehead, but this one was immediately followed by a
well-remembered voice: "Are you there, Byam?" and I opened the door
to Dr. Hamilton.</p>

<p>I had not seen him since the closing day of the court-martial.
He informed me that he had just been appointed surgeon to the
<i>Spitfire</i>, then stationed at Portsmouth. It was one of the
ships I could see from my cabin window. She was on the eve of
sailing for the Newfoundland station, and the doctor had come to
bid me good-bye.</p>

<p>We talked of the <i>Pandora</i>, the shipwreck, the voyage to
Timor, and of those two monsters of inhumanity, Edwards and Parkin.
Dr. Hamilton was no longer under the necessity of concealing his
feelings concerning either of these men. Parkin he loathed, of
course, but his opinion of Edwards was, naturally, more fair and
just than my own.</p>

<p>"I quite understand your feeling toward him, Byam," he said;
"but the truth is that Edwards is not the beast you think him."</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten the morning of the wreck, Doctor, when we
were chained hand and foot until the very moment when the ship went
down?" I asked. "That our lives were saved was due entirely to the
humanity of Moulter, the boatswain's mate. And have you forgotten
how later, when we were on the sand-bar, Edwards refused to give us
a sail that was not in use, so that we might protect our naked
bodies from the sun?"</p>

<p>"I agree with you there; that <i>was</i> cruelty of the
monstrous sort; no excuse whatever can be made for it. But
otherwise, Byam...Well, you must remember the character of the man.
He has a high sense of what he considers his duty, but not a grain
of imagination&mdash;nothing remotely resembling what might be
called uncommon sense. You will remember my telling you of his
Admiralty instructions? He was ordered to confine his prisoners in
such a manner as to preclude all possibility of escape, and at the
same time to have a due regard for the preservation of their lives.
Captains of the Edwards kind should never be given truly
responsible positions; they are fitted to carry out only the letter
and never the spirit of Admiralty orders. One can at least say this
for him: he acted in accordance with what he considered his
duty."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid, sir," I replied, "that I can never take so lenient
a view of him. I have suffered too much at his hands."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder, Byam. I don't wonder at all. You have..."</p>

<p>The doctor was in the very midst of a sentence when the door was
flung open and Sir Joseph entered. He was breathing heavily as
though he had been running, and I could see that he was labouring
under great emotion.</p>

<p>"Byam, my dear lad!"</p>

<p>He broke off, unable to say more. I felt an icy chill at my
heart. Dr. Hamilton rose hastily, and looked from Sir Joseph to me
and back again.</p>

<p>"No...Wait...It's not what you think...One moment..." He took a
stride into the tiny cabin and gripped me by the shoulders.
"Byam...Tinkler is safe...He is found...He is in London now; at
this moment!"</p>

<p>"Sit you down, lad," said Dr. Hamilton. I needed no urging. My
legs felt as weak as though I had been lying in bed for months. The
surgeon took a small silver flask from his pocket, unscrewed the
top, and offered it to me. Sir Joseph sat in the chair at my table
and mopped his forehead with a large silk handkerchief. "Will you
prescribe for me as well, Doctor?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Please forgive me, sir," I said, handing him the flask.</p>

<p>"Good heaven, Byam, don't apologize!" he replied. "Necessity
knows no laws of deportment." He took a pull at the flask and
returned it to the surgeon. "Damn fine brandy, sir. I'll wager it
has never done better service than here, this day...Byam, I came
from London as fast as a light chaise would bring me. Yesterday, at
breakfast, I was glancing through my <i>Times</i>. In the shipping
news I chanced to see an item announcing the arrival of the West
Indiaman <i>Sapphire</i> with the survivors of the crew of the
<i>Carib Maid</i>, lost on a passage between Jamaica and the
Havannah. I need not tell you that I left my breakfast unfinished.
When I arrived at the dock I found the <i>Sapphire</i> already
discharging her cargo. The <i>Carib Maid</i> people had gone ashore
the evening before. I traced them to an inn near by. Tinkler was
there, on the point of setting out to the house of his
brother-in-law, Fryer. Like the other <i>Carib Maid</i> survivors,
he was still dressed in various articles of clothing furnished by
the <i>Sapphire</i>'s company. He looked the part of a shipwrecked
mariner, but I gave him no time for excuses. I bundled him into my
carriage and carried him straight to Lord Hood. As luck would have
it, the Admiral was in Town; he had dined with me the night before.
Tinkler, of course, was in the greatest bewilderment at all this. I
said nothing of my reason for wanting him&mdash;not a word. At
half-past ten Lord Hood and I were at the Admiralty with Tinkler
between us, dressed just as he had come ashore, in a seaman's
jersey and boots three sizes too large for him.</p>

<p>"Now what has happened, or what will happen, is this: Tinkler
will be examined before the Admiralty Commissioners, who alone have
the power to hear his evidence. By the grace of God and my copy of
yesterday's <i>Times</i>, that evidence cannot be impeached as
biased or prejudiced. Tinkler knows nothing of the court-martial.
He has not seen Fryer, and he does not know that you are within ten
thousand miles of London. I left him at the Admiralty, in proper
charge, and came in all haste to Portsmouth."</p>

<p>I could think of nothing to say. I merely sat, staring like a
dumb man, at Sir Joseph.</p>

<p>"Will the court-martial be reconvened to pass upon this
evidence?" Dr. Hamilton asked.</p>

<p>"No, that cannot be done; it is unnecessary that it should be
done. The Admiralty Commissioners who will receive Tinkler's
evidence have the power, in case the new testimony warrants it, of
reversing the verdict of the court-martial in Byam's case, and
completely exonerating him. We shall have their decision within a
few days, I hope."</p>

<p>My heart sank at this. "Will it require days, sir, for the
decision to be made?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You must bear up, lad," Sir Joseph replied. "I understand, God
knows, how hard the waiting will be; but official wheels turn
slowly."</p>

<p>"And my ship, the <i>Spitfire</i>, sails to-morrow," said Dr.
Hamilton, ruefully. "I shall have to leave England without knowing
your fate, Byam."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's just as well, Doctor," I replied.</p>

<p>Sir Joseph opened his mouth to speak, and then gazed blankly at
me.</p>

<p>"Byam, I'm afraid I've made an unpardonable mistake! The
realization has only this moment come to me! Good God, what have I
done! You should have been told nothing of all this until the
decision of the Commissioners has been given!"</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir," I replied. "You shan't be allowed to condemn
yourself. You have given me reason to hope. Even though the hope
prove unfounded, I shall be none the less grateful."</p>

<p>"You truly mean that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>He gave me a keen, scrutinizing glance. "I see that you do. I am
glad I came." He rose. "And now I must leave you again. I shall go
back to London at once. I must be there to expedite matters as much
as possible for you." He shook my hand. "If it is good news, Byam,
Captain Montague shall receive it for you by messenger riding the
best horses that ever galloped the Portsmouth road."</p>

<h2><a name="c25" id="c25"></a>CHAPTER XXV.&mdash;TINKLER</h2>

<p>Sir Joseph Banks carried my completed manuscripts back to London
with him. Having finished my work, I asked permission to take up my
quarters in the gun room again, and returned the same evening. The
strain of waiting was less hard to endure in company. I told only
Morrison of Tinkler's return; it would have been cruel to have
informed the others, men deprived of all hope of life.</p>

<p>Morrison's Bible proved a resource to all of us during those
last days. It was the same copy he had carried with him on the
<i>Bounty</i>, and had been preserved even through the wreck of the
<i>Pandora</i>. We read aloud, in turn, to the others, and we
continued for hours so as to prevent ourselves from thinking of
what was soon to come. Millward and Muspratt had aroused themselves
from their stupor of despair. My liking and respect for these men
increased greatly at this time. Tom Ellison had never for a moment
lost his courage. It was a bitter thought that this lad, who had
not an ounce of harm in him, was to lose his life as the result of
a boyish indiscretion, at a time when he was most fitted to live.
Only Burkitt remained as he had been from the day when sentence was
pronounced. Except for brief intervals at mealtime, he paced up and
down, hour after hour. Occasionally he would sit down for a moment,
his head between his hands, staring dully at the floor; then he
would lift his great shaggy head and glance around the room as
though he had never seen it before, and a moment later spring to
his feet and resume his pacing.</p>

<p>On the morning of October 26, we watched the <i>Spitfire</i>
getting up her anchors. It was a windless day, and boats' crews
from the <i>Hector</i> and the <i>Brunswick</i> were sent to assist
in towing her out of the harbour. We saw, or thought we saw, Dr.
Hamilton standing on the poop as the ship moved slowly out toward
Spithead. Whether or not it was the surgeon, we knew that he was
thinking of us that morning as we were thinking of him and wishing
him Godspeed.</p>

<p>We welcomed every diversion, however slight; not a ship's boat
crossing our line of vision escaped us. We criticized the way her
men handled the oars, and conjectured as to where she was going and
why. And every time the door of the gun room opened, every time the
guard was changed or food was brought, I felt the cold chill about
my heart that every condemned man must have known. Many a time
during those weeks did I wish that the Admiralty Commissioners
might have stood in our places for one day. The needless cruelty
inflicted upon six men, prolonged during a period of more than a
month, gave me a disgust for official routine which I retain to
this day.</p>

<p>On the Sunday afternoon, Morrison was reading aloud to the rest
of us. It was a cold day of drizzling rain, and Morrison was
sitting close to one of the ports, holding his Bible on a level
with his eyes that he might benefit by what dim light there was.
All of us, excepting Burkitt, were gathered around him as we
listened to that most beautiful of all the Psalms:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.</blockquote>

<p>Morrison read on in his clear musical voice, choosing those
psalms that had comforted many generations of men in time of
trouble. Of a sudden he halted in the midst of a sentence, and
turned his head quickly toward the door. In so far as I remember we
had heard nothing,&mdash;no sound, no voice, no tread of
feet,&mdash;and yet we rose together and stood waiting, our eyes
turned in the same direction. Burkitt stopped short and looked from
the guards to us and back again. "What's up?" he asked, hoarsely.
There was no need to reply. The door opened and a lieutenant of
marines entered, followed by the master-at-arms and a guard of
eight men.</p>

<p>It was all but dark in the room and we could scarcely
distinguish the faces of the men who had entered. The
master-at-arms carried a paper in his hand. He crossed to one of
the ports and held it up to the dim light.</p>

<p>"Thomas Burkitt&mdash;John Millward&mdash;Thomas Ellison."</p>

<p>"The prisoners named step forward," the lieutenant ordered.</p>

<p>The three men moved to the centre of the room. Handcuffs were
snapped upon their wrists, and they were placed in the centre of
the guard, four men in front and four behind.</p>

<p>"Forward, march!"</p>

<p>They were gone in an instant without a word of farewell being
said. Morrison, Muspratt, and I stood where we were, and the door
was closed and locked once more. A moment later, as we peered from
the ports, we saw one of the <i>Hector's</i> cutters put off from
the gangway, and in the last grey light of the autumn afternoon we
could distinguish the three shackled men on a thwart astern. Moored
abreast of the <i>Hector</i> and about four hundred yards distant
was H.M.S. <i>Brunswick</i>. We saw the cutter pass under her
counter and disappear.</p>

<p>The anxiety of the night that followed is painful to recall.
Morrison, Muspratt, and I made no pretense of sleeping. We sat by
one of the ports, now and then peering out into the darkness toward
the <i>Brunswick</i>, talking in low voices of the men who had
gone. We knew well enough that it was their last night of life. The
fact that we had been left behind gave us reason to hope that their
fate was not to be ours. My heart went out to poor Muspratt, whose
anguish of mind may be imagined. I did not dare hint, even now, at
what Sir Joseph had told me concerning him, but I was glad that
Morrison encouraged him to hope.</p>

<p>"Your case has been taken under consideration, Muspratt; I am
sure of it," he said. "I have never doubted that it would be. The
fact that we have been left here proves that there is something in
the wind concerning us."</p>

<p>"What do you think, Mr. Byam?" asked Muspratt.</p>

<p>"That Morrison is right," I replied. "He has been recommended to
the King's clemency. The Court's appeal on his behalf must have
been granted. You and I have been left here with him. Don't you
see, Muspratt? If they intended to hang us, we would have been sent
to the <i>Brunswick</i> with the rest."</p>

<p>"But maybe they want to hang them first? Or what if they're
going to hang us on the <i>Hector</i>?"</p>

<p>So we talked the night long, and God knows it was long. We
considered every possibility, every conceivable reason for our
separation from the others. And the minutes and the hours dragged
by, and at last the darkness was suffused with the ashy light of
dawn, through which the huge mass of the <i>Brunswick</i> grew more
and more distinct.</p>

<p>Our guard was changed with the watch, at eight bells. No news
came. One of the few prohibitions imposed upon us&mdash;and a quite
just one&mdash;was that we should not speak to the guards, so we
had no means of knowing what news was current on the ship. At nine
o'clock, Morrison, who was standing by a port, turned and said,
"They've run up the signal for punishment on the
<i>Brunswick</i>."</p>

<p>On all British ships, eleven o'clock in the morning was the hour
for inflicting punishment. We had no doubt as to whom the
<i>Brunswick's</i> signal concerned. Ellison, Burkitt, and Millward
had but two hours to live.</p>

<p>At half-past ten we saw one of the <i>Hector's</i> longboats,
filled with seamen, put off to the <i>Brunswick</i>. Boats from
other vessels in the harbour followed; the men in them, we knew,
were being sent to witness the execution. Muspratt remained at the
port, gazing toward the <i>Brunswick</i> as though fascinated by
the sight of her lofty yards. Morrison and I paced the room
together, talking in the Indian tongue of Teina and Itea and other
friends at Tahiti, in a desperate attempt to occupy our minds. It
was getting on toward the hour when Captain Montague entered,
followed by the lieutenant who had come the night before. A glance
at the captain's face told us all we needed to know, but if there
was still doubt in our minds it was banished when the lieutenant
ordered the guard to dismiss. The men filed quickly out, glancing
back at us with friendly smiles. Captain Montague unfolded the
paper in his hand.</p>

<p>"James Morrison&mdash;William Muspratt," he called.</p>

<p>The two men stepped forward. Captain Montague glanced at them
over the top of the paper he held, a kindly gleam in his blue eyes.
He then read, solemnly:</p>

<p>"In response to the earnest appeal of Lord Hood (Admiral of the
Blue, and President of the Court-Martial by which you have been
tried, convicted, and condemned to death for the crime of mutiny on
His Majesty's armed transport, <i>Bounty</i>), who, by reason of
certain extenuating circumstances, has begged that you may not be
compelled to suffer the extreme penalty prescribed by our just
laws, His Majesty is graciously pleased to grant to you, and each
of you, a free and unconditional pardon."</p>

<p>"Roger Byam."</p>

<p>I took my place beside my two comrades.</p>

<p>"The Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral
of Great Britain and Ireland, having received and heard the sworn
testimony of Robert Tinkler, former midshipman of His Majesty's
armed transport, <i>Bounty</i>, are convinced of your entire
innocence of the crime of mutiny, for which you have been tried,
convicted, and condemned to death. The Lord's Commissioners do,
therefore, annul the verdict of the Court-Martial as it respects
your person, and you stand acquitted."</p>

<p>Captain Montague then stepped forward and shook each of us
warmly by the hand.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt," he said, "that three loyal subjects have been
spared to-day for further usefulness to His Majesty."</p>

<p>My heart was too full for words. I could only mutter, "Thank
you, sir!" but Morrison would not have been Morrison had he not
been prepared even for such a moment as this.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, earnestly, "when the sentence of the law was
passed upon me, I received it, I trust, as became a man; and if it
had been carried into execution, I should have met my fate, I hope,
in a manner becoming a Christian. I receive with gratitude my
Sovereign's mercy, for which my future life shall be faithfully
devoted to His service."</p>

<p>Captain Montague bowed gravely.</p>

<p>"Are we now at liberty, sir?" I asked, doubtingly.</p>

<p>"You are free to go this moment if you choose."</p>

<p>"You will understand, sir, that we desire, if possible, to
avoid..."</p>

<p>The captain turned to the lieutenant. "Mr. Cunningham, will you
see to it that a boat is ordered at once?"</p>

<p><a name="id08" id="id08"></a>Captain Montague accompanied us to
the upper deck, and a few moments later we were informed that the
boat was waiting at the gangway. As I bade farewell to the captain
he said, "I hope, Mr. Byam, to have the pleasure of meeting you
again soon, under more fortunate circumstances." We climbed hastily
down the side, and the midshipman in charge of the boat's crew gave
orders to push off. We were in no position to enjoy the sweetness
of those first moments of freedom. Six bells had struck while we
were waiting on deck. Within two cables' lengths of us lay the
<i>Brunswick</i>, her lofty masts and yards clearly outlined
against the grey sky, and on our way to the wharf at Portsmouth we
had to pass directly under her carved and gilded stern. Three men
on her upper deck were standing at the very brink of death. Well we
knew what was happening there. We sat with averted faces. We drew
away from her, the seamen pulling at their oars steadily and in
silence, but I saw that their eyes were all turned in the same
direction, toward the tall ship now astern.</p>

<p>Of a sudden a great gun broke the silence with a reverberating
roar. Against my will I turned my head. A cloud of smoke half hid
the vessel, but as it billowed out and drifted slowly away I saw
three small black figures suspended in mid-air, twitching as they
swayed slowly from side to side.</p>

<p>Captain Montague had given me a letter from Sir Joseph, written
at the Admiralty immediately after the decision of the
Commissioners was known. He had taken inside places for us on that
night's London coach. As a postscript he had written: "Mr. Erskine
expects you at his house. You must not disappoint the old
gentleman, Byam. You will want to see no one for several days; I
quite understand that. When you have had the time you need alone,
will you send me word? I have something of importance to
communicate."</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more characteristic of Sir Joseph than
this postscript. With all his bluff, hearty, manly qualities, he
combined the delicacy and thoughtfulness of a woman.</p>

<p>The three of us were too shaken in mind for
conversation&mdash;too sore in spirit, too bewildered at the change
in our fortunes. We sat gazing out at the fields of home gradually
fading from view as the autumn evening closed in. Opposite me in
the coach there was a vacant place, and it remained unoccupied all
the way to London, which we reached at daylight the following
morning. But for me, all through the night, Tom Ellison sat there.
I heard his laughter, his cheery voice. I saw him peering eagerly
out of the window, missing nothing, enjoying everything, engaging
in conversation the old gentleman who sat next to me. "Yes, sir,
we've been away from home five long years, lacking one month. If
you've ever been a sailor you'll know what this journey means to
us...What's that, sir?...No, no; much farther than that. Ever hear
of an island called Tahiti? Well, that's where we've been. If you
was to dig a hole straight through the earth you'd come out
somewhere near it."</p>

<p>Sea Law. Just&mdash;yes; just, savage, and implacable. I would
have given the whole of the Articles of War and all those who wrote
them to have had Tom Ellison sitting, in the flesh, opposite me in
that seat in the London coach.</p>

<p>It saddens me to think of our brief, casual farewells. There was
reason for this. We three had been together so long, it was
inconceivable that we could drift apart. We stood outside the
booking office at the Angel, St. Clements, Strand, watching foot
passengers, carts, chaises, and hackney coaches passing by.
Morrison and I were both well provided with money, he by his family
and I by Mr. Erskine, but Muspratt, we knew, had not two ha'pence
to rub together in his pocket. His home was in Yarmouth, where he
had lived with his mother and two younger sisters. Morrison was
bound to the North Country.</p>

<p>"See here, Muspratt," he said, "how are you off for rhino?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll manage, Mr. Morrison," he replied. "I've ridden
shanks' mare to Yarmouth before now."</p>

<p>"And your mother's waiting for you there? He's not to ride
shanks' mare this time, eh, Byam?"</p>

<p>"That he is not!" I replied, heartily. We pressed five pounds
each upon him, and it did our hearts good to see the expression of
amazement and delight on Muspratt's face. We shook his hand warmly
and he hurried away at once to book his seat in the Yarmouth coach.
We stood looking after him as he made his way down the crowded
street. He turned and waved to us from the corner, and
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Well, Byam?" said Morrison. I gripped his hand.</p>

<p>"God bless you, lad!" he said. "We must never lose track of each
other." A moment later I was alone, among strangers, for the first
time in five years.</p>

<p>I could not have wished for a kinder, more considerate host than
Mr. Erskine, my father's old friend. He had long been a widower,
and still lived, with three elderly servants, in the house in
Fig-Tree Court, near the Temple, where I had last visited him on my
way to join the <i>Bounty</i>. The silence of that well-ordered
house, where I had no appointments to keep and might do as I
pleased from morning till night, was as healing to my spirit as the
breath of the sea to a man at the end of a long illness. I wandered
about the quiet streets in the vicinity of the Temple, or sat for
hours by the window in my pleasant room overlooking Fig-Tree Court,
where scarcely a dozen passers-by were to be seen in the course of
an afternoon. And I thought of nothing. I had to accustom myself by
degrees to the business of living&mdash;to the very thought that
the gift of life was still mine to enjoy. Meanwhile, I was scarcely
more animate than the two old trees that cast faint shadows on the
pavement in the wan autumnal sun.</p>

<p>I had gone for my usual walk that day. When I returned, at five
o'clock, Mr. Erskine had not yet come in, but Clegg, his butler,
met me in the hallway.</p>

<p>"There's a gentleman waiting to see you, sir. He's in the
library."</p>

<p>I took the stairs three at a time. I knew that my letter would
bring him at the earliest possible moment. I flung open the door.
There was Tinkler, standing with his back to the sea-coal fire.</p>

<p>Mr. Erskine was engaged that evening. At least, he sent word by
Clegg to that effect; but my belief is that, upon coming home and
learning that Tinkler was there, he had retired to his own room for
no other reason than that we might have the evening together,
alone. We had dinner in the library, in front of the fire. There
was so much to be said that we scarcely knew how or where to begin.
Tinkler had not yet recovered from his astonishment at the manner
in which he had been pounced upon and kidnapped by Sir Joseph
Banks.</p>

<p>"Remember, Byam, that I still thought of you as being somewhere
on the other side of the world. When I had returned from my first
voyage to the West Indies, I had heard that a ship, the
<i>Pandora</i>, had been sent out to search for the <i>Bounty</i>.
That was the extent of my information about you, and months had
passed since that time. I had heard nothing of Edwards's return,
and not a word of the court-martial. I had gone ashore the previous
evening, in clothing borrowed from men on the <i>Sapphire</i>, the
ship that had rescued us. Another time I'll tell you the story of
the <i>Carib Maid</i> and how she was lost. Only ten of us
survived,&mdash;the other boats were lost,&mdash;and there we were
at an inn about a stone's throw from the dock where the
<i>Sapphire</i> was berthed. I'd had a glorious breakfast of eggs
and bacon, and was just on the point of setting out for my
brother-in-law's house when a fine carriage and pair drove up, and
before I could say How-do-you-do or God bless me I found myself
inside, sitting opposite Sir Joseph Banks.</p>

<p>"I had never laid eyes on him until that moment. He gave not
even a hint of what he required of me, but I imagined that it must,
somehow, concern the <i>Bounty</i>. 'Possess your soul in patience,
Mr. Tinkler,' he said. 'I shall see to it that Mr. Fryer is
notified of your arrival. I will merely say this, now: Mr. Fryer
will strongly approve of my taking you in charge in this
high-handed fashion.' With that I had to be content. Sir Joseph
gave some instructions to his coachman and we drove westward at
more than a smart clip. Presently we stopped before a very splendid
house. Sir Joseph leaped out, strode up to the door, vanished, and
ten minutes later out he came again with Admiral Hood in tow!
Naturally, I was more mystified than ever, but I felt highly
flattered at having two such guardians. We drove straight to the
Admiralty.</p>

<p>"I shan't go into the details. Sir Joseph and the Admiral left
me in charge of a Captain Maxon&mdash;Matson&mdash;some such name.
He was a very courteous, pleasant, and vigilant companion, and
didn't let me out of his sight for a moment. I spent the rest of
that day, the following night, and until ten o'clock the next
morning in his company. We told each other the stories of our
lives, but all I gathered from him as to the business in hand was
that it concerned the <i>Bounty</i>.</p>

<p>"Promptly at ten that morning, I was taken before the Board of
Admiralty Commissioners. Picture me, still dressed in the cast-off
clothing of three men, standing before that august assembly! I was
sworn, and then graciously permitted to sit down.</p>

<p>"'Mr. Tinkler, will you please to inform the Commissioners of
anything you may know concerning Roger Byam, former midshipman of
His Majesty's armed transport, <i>Bounty</i>.'</p>

<p>"You can imagine, Byam, how the mention of your name affected
me. I felt a cold shiver of apprehension running with considerable
speed up my spine and on to the roots of my hair. I had by no means
forgotten how often Bligh had damned you as a piratical scoundrel
without permitting any of us to say a word in your defense. Believe
me, I had tried; and the second time I attempted it I thought he
meant to throw me out of the boat. Now I thought, 'By God, old
Byam's caught! He's in trouble, here or somewhere.' I looked from
one to another of the Commissioners for a hint of what was expected
of me.</p>

<p>"'Do you mean, sir, concerning his present whereabouts?' I
asked.</p>

<p>"'No. Perhaps the question was a little vague. You are quite
naturally mystified. We wish to know the particulars, if you recall
them, of a conversation said to have taken place on the
quarter-deck of the <i>Bounty</i> between Mr. Fletcher Christian
and Mr. Byam on the night previous to the mutiny on that ship. Did
you overhear such a conversation?'</p>

<p>"I remembered it at once, and it was at that moment, Byam, that
light began to dawn upon me.</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir,' I replied; 'I remember it quite well.'</p>

<p>"'Reflect carefully, Mr. Tinkler. A man's life depends upon what
you shall now depose concerning that conversation. Take as much
time as you need to collect your thoughts. Omit no smallest
detail.'</p>

<p>"The whole business came clear to me, Byam. I knew then
precisely what was wanted, and you may thank God that my memory is
as yet unimpaired by old age. But here's the extraordinary thing:
from the night when you and Christian were talking between the
larboard guns on the quarter-deck until the moment when I stood
before the Commissioners, I'd forgotten the immensely important
fact that Bligh had overheard a part of what you said. Wouldn't you
think that might have stuck in my mind? There's a reasonable
explanation, of course: during the boat voyage to Timor, and
afterward, old Bligh never once, to my knowledge, explained why he
considered you of Christian's party. We all believed that the
reason was your failing to appear on deck before the launch was
veered astern. And we knew that Christian had spoken to you a
number of times on the morning of the mutiny. Furthermore, you were
Christian's friend. That was more than enough to make the old
rascal damn you straight out.</p>

<p>"You may believe that I took my time in proceeding. I told the
story from the moment when we went on deck together during
Peckover's watch. I'd forgotten nothing. I even told them how I'd
confessed to you that I was one of the culprits who had stolen
Bligh's invaluable coconuts. I told them how I lay down to take a
caulk between the guns just before Christian came along and engaged
you in conversation. But above everything, Byam, thank heaven and
Robert Tinkler for this: I remembered how Bligh came up at the very
moment you were shaking Christian's hand, when you said, 'You can
count on me.'</p>

<p>"The Commissioners sat leaning forward in their chairs. One old
fellow sat with a hand cupped behind his ear. On his behalf, I
spoke with particular slowness and distinctness. Mr. Christian
replied: "Good, Byam," or "Thank you, Byam," I cannot be certain
which, and they shook hands upon it. At this moment Mr. Bligh
interrupted them; they had not heard him approach. He made some
remark about their being up late, and..."</p>

<p>"'That will do, Mr. Tinkler,' I was told. I was ushered out of
the room, and...well, old lad, here we are!"</p>

<p>"You know, Byam," Tinkler went on, after a moment of silence,
"I've often wondered whether that affair of the coconuts was not
the actual cause of the mutiny. Do you remember how Bligh abused
Christian?"</p>

<p>"I'm not likely to forget that," I replied.</p>

<p>"I can recall Bligh's very words: 'Yes, you bloody hound! I do
think so! You must have stolen some of mine or you would be able to
give a better account of your own!' What a thing to say to his
second-in-command! I more than half believe that was what goaded
Christian to desperation. What do you think?"</p>

<p>"Let's not talk of it, Tinkler," I said. "I'm sick to death of
the business."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, lad. Of course you are."</p>

<p>"But I'd like nothing better than to hear about your voyage in
the launch to Timor."</p>

<p>"I'll say this, Byam: in that situation, Bligh was beyond all
praise. He was the same old blackguard, and he ruled us with an
iron hand, but, by God, he brought us through! I don't believe
there's another man in England who could have done it."</p>

<p>"What prevented him and Purcell from murdering each other,
cooped up as they were in a small boat?"</p>

<p>"It was a near thing, a very near thing. Matters came to a head
at a small island on the Great Barrier Reef. We were in a desperate
situation and had put in there for the night. I've forgotten how
the dispute started, but I remember Bligh and Purcell standing on a
sandy beach facing each other like a couple of old bulls. We were
damn near dead of hunger and thirst, but these two still had fight
in 'em. Bligh made a stride to the boat, took two of our four
cutlasses, and handed one to the carpenter. 'Now, sir,' he said,
'defend yourself or forever hold your peace!' The rest of us
scarecrows stood looking on; we were too wretched to care what
might happen. And Purcell backed down. He apologized. That was the
only time there was ever a question of Bligh's authority."</p>

<p>"Do you remember Coupang, Tinkler?"</p>

<p>"Coupang! That heaven on earth! Let me tell you how we came in.
It was about three in the morning...but wait a minute! How about
filling my glass? As a host, Byam, you leave something to be
desired."</p>

<p>And so it went the night through.</p>

<h2><a name="c26" id="c26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.&mdash;WITHYCOMBE</h2>

<p>I had spent a week at Fig-Tree Court when I sent Sir Joseph the
message he had asked for. I supposed that he wished to see me for
some reason connected with my Indian dictionary, and now that the
first numbness of mind succeeding my acquittal had passed, I looked
forward with pleasure to the interview; and it would give me an
opportunity to ask whether I might render any services to him, or
to the Royal Society, upon my return to the South Sea.</p>

<p>The death of my mother had severed my last tie with England, and
I had been through so much that all ambition, all a young man's
craving for a life of action, seemed dead in me. I may, perhaps, be
excused for my feeling of bitterness at this time. English faces
seemed strange to me, and English ways harsh and even cruel. I
longed only for Tehani and the tranquil beauty of the South
Sea.</p>

<p>It was my intention to inform Sir Joseph of my plan to leave
England for good. I was possessed of ample means to do as I
pleased&mdash;even to purchase a vessel, should that prove
necessary. Ships would be sailing from time to time for the newly
formed settlement at Port Jackson, in New South Wales, and, once
there, I might find it possible to buy or charter a small ship to
take me to Tahiti. I knew that, for my mother's sake, I could not
leave England without paying a visit to Withycombe, and I both
dreaded and longed to see our old house, so filled with
memories.</p>

<p>Sir Joseph's reply to my message was an invitation to dinner on
the same evening, and I found him in company with Captain Montague,
of the <i>Hector</i>. We discussed for a time the events taking
place in Europe, which pointed to an early outbreak of war.
Presently Sir Joseph turned to me.</p>

<p>"What are your plans, Byam?" he asked. "Shall you return to the
Navy, or go up to Oxford, as your father hoped?"</p>

<p>"Neither, sir," I replied. "I have decided to return to the
South Sea." Montague set down his glass at my words, and Sir Joseph
looked at me in astonishment, but neither man spoke.</p>

<p>"There is nothing, now, to keep me in England," I added.</p>

<p>Sir Joseph shook his head slowly. "It had not occurred to me
that you were considering Tahiti," he said. "I feared that, in your
present state, you might intend to give up the sea for the
seclusion of an academic career. But the islands...no, my lad!"</p>

<p>"Why not, sir?" I asked. "I am free of obligations at home, and
I should be happy there. Saving yourself and Captain Montague and a
handful of other friends, there is no one in England I wish to see
again."</p>

<p>"I understand&mdash;I understand," Sir Joseph remarked kindly.
"You have suffered much, Byam; but remember, time will heal the
deepest wounds. And remember another thing: if I may say so, you
have obligations, and weighty ones."</p>

<p>"To whom, sir?" I inquired.</p>

<p>My host paused, thoughtfully. "I see that it has not even
occurred to you," he said. "It is a delicate matter to explain.
Montague, suppose I leave it to you?"</p>

<p>The captain sipped his wine as if pondering how to begin.
Presently he looked up. "Sir Joseph and I have spoken of you more
than once, Mr. Byam. You have obligations, as he says."</p>

<p>"To whom, sir?" I asked once more.</p>

<p>"To your name; to the memory of your father and mother. You have
been imprisoned and tried for mutiny, and though you were acquitted
and are as innocent as Sir Joseph or myself, something&mdash;a
little unpleasant something&mdash;may cling to your name.
<i>May</i> cling, I say; whether or not it shall, rests with you.
If you choose to follow some career ashore, or, worst of all,
decide to bury yourself in the South Sea, men will say, when your
name is spoken of: 'Roger Byam? Yes, I remember him well; one of
the <i>Bounty</i> mutineers. He was tried by court-martial and
acquitted at the last moment. A near thing!' Public opinion is a
mighty force, Mr. Byam. No man can afford to disregard it."</p>

<p>"If I may speak plainly, sir," I replied, warmly, "damn public
opinion! I am innocent, and my parents&mdash;if there is a life
beyond death&mdash;know of my innocence. Let the others believe
what they will!"</p>

<p>"You were a victim of circumstance and have been hardly used,"
said Captain Montague, kindly. "I understand very well how you
feel; but Sir Joseph and I are right. You owe it to the honourable
name you bear to continue the career of a sea officer. War is in
the air; your part in it will soon silence the whispers. Come,
Byam! To speak plainly, I want you on the <i>Hector</i>, and have
saved a place in the berth for you."</p>

<p>Sir Joseph nodded. "That's what you should do, Byam."</p>

<p>I was still in a nervous condition as the result of my long
imprisonment and the suspense I had been through. Captain
Montague's kindness moved me deeply.</p>

<p>"Uncommonly good of you, sir," I muttered. "Indeed I appreciate
the offer, but..."</p>

<p>"There's no need for an immediate decision," he interrupted.
"Think over what I have said. Let me know your decision within a
month. I can hold the offer open until then."</p>

<p>"Yes, take your time," said Sir Joseph. "We'll say no more of it
to-night."</p>

<p>Captain Montague took leave of us early; afterward Sir Joseph
led me to his study, hung with weapons and ornaments from distant
lands. "Byam," he said, when we had settled ourselves before the
fire, "there is a question I have long desired to ask you. You know
me for a man of honour; if you see fit to answer, you have my word
that I will never divulge the reply."</p>

<p>He paused. "Proceed, sir," I said; "I will do my best."</p>

<p>"Where is Fletcher Christian&mdash;can you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Upon my word, sir," I replied, "I do not know, nor could I
hazard a guess."</p>

<p>He looked at me for a moment with his shrewd blue eyes, rose
briskly, and pulled down a great chart of the Pacific from its
roller on the wall. "Fetch the lamp, Byam," he said.</p>

<p>Side by side, while I held the lamp, we scanned the chart of the
greatest ocean in the world. "Here is Tahiti," he said. "What
course was the <i>Bounty</i> steering when last seen?"</p>

<p>"Northeast by north, I should say."</p>

<p>"It might have been a blind, of course, but the Marquesas lie
that way. The Spaniard, Menda&ntilde;a, discovered them long ago.
Rich islands, too, and only a week distant with the wind abeam.
See, here they are."</p>

<p>"I doubt it, sir," I replied. "Christian gave us to understand
that it was his intention to seek out an island as yet unknown. He
would not have risked settling on a place likely to be
visited."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," he replied, musingly. "Edwards touched at
Aitutaki, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I replied, and as I glanced at the dot of land in
the immense waste of waters, a sudden thought struck me. "By God!"
I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"What is it, Byam?"</p>

<p>"I must tell you in confidence, Sir Joseph."</p>

<p>"You have my word."</p>

<p>"I told you that I could not even hazard a guess, but I had
forgotten one possibility. After the mutiny, when we were sailing
eastward from Tofoa, we raised a rich volcanic island not marked on
any chart. It lies to the southwest of Aitutaki, distant not more
than one hundred and fifty miles, I believe. We did not land, but
the Indians came out in their canoes, and seemed friendly enough. I
questioned one man in the language of Tahiti, and he told me the
name of the place was Rarotonga. The mutineers were eager to go
ashore, but Christian would have none of it. Yet, when he left
Tahiti for the last time, he must have thought of this rich unknown
island, so close to the west. If I were to search for Christian
now, I should go straight to Rarotonga and be pretty sure of
finding him there."</p>

<p>Eighteen years were to pass before I learned how mistaken I was
in this opinion. Sir Joseph listened attentively. "That's
interesting," he said. "Captain Cook had no idea there was land so
close to Aitutaki. A high island, you say?"</p>

<p>"Two or three thousand feet, at least. The mountains are rugged
and green to the very tops. There is a broad belt of coastal land;
it looked rich and populous."</p>

<p>"The very place for them! Is the island large?"</p>

<p>"Nearly the size of Eimeo, I should say."</p>

<p>"Gad, Byam!" he exclaimed, regretfully; "I'd like to report the
discovery. But have no fear&mdash;the secret is safe with
me...Christian...poor devil!"</p>

<p>"You knew him, sir?"</p>

<p>He nodded. "I knew him well."</p>

<p>"He was my good friend," I said. "There was provocation, God
knows, for what he did."</p>

<p>"No doubt. It's strange...I had supposed that Bligh was his best
friend."</p>

<p>"I am sure that Captain Bligh thought so, too...I've a sad task
ahead of me. I promised Christian that I would see his mother if
ever I reached England."</p>

<p>"His people are gentlefolk; they live in Cumberland."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I know."</p>

<p>Sir Joseph rolled up the chart. I glanced at the tall clock
against the wall. "Time I was getting home, sir," I said.</p>

<p>"Aye, bedtime, lad. But one word before you go. Let me advise
you, most earnestly, to consider Captain Montague's offer. You are
sore in spirit, but that will pass. Montague and I are older men.
We know this sorry old world better than you. Give up the idea of
burying yourself in the South Sea!"</p>

<p>"I'll think it over, sir," I said.</p>

<p>Day after day I put off my visit to Withycombe. I dreaded
leaving the quiet old house in Fig-Tree Court, and when at last I
took leave of Mr. Erskine I had already been to Cumberland and back
on Christian's errand. Of my interview with his mother I shall not
speak. On a chill winter evening, with a fine rain drizzling down,
I alighted from the coach in Taunton, and found our carriage
awaiting me. Our old coachman was dead, and his son, the companion
of many a boyhood scrape, was on the box. The street was ankle-deep
in mud, with pools of water glimmering in the faint gleam of the
lamps. I stepped into the carriage, and we went swaying down the
rutty, dimly lighted street. The faint musty smell of leather was
perfume to me, and brought back a flood of memories&mdash;of rainy
Sundays in the past when we had driven to church. Here, in the
door, was the pocket into which my mother used to slip her prayer
book, nearly always forgotten until we were about to enter our pew.
I could hear the very tones of her voice, humorous and apologetic:
"Oh, Roger! My prayer book! Run back and fetch it, dear." And there
seemed to linger in the old coach the fragrance of English
lavender, which she preferred to all the scents of France.</p>

<p>The rain fell steadily, and the horses trotted on, splashing
through pools, slowing to a walk on the hills. Tired with my long
journey from London, I fell into a doze. When I awoke, the wheels
were crunching on the gravel of the Withycombe drive, and ahead of
us I could see the lights of the house. For a moment, five years
were blotted from my mind; I was returning from school for the
Christmas holidays, and my mother would be listening for the
carriage, ready to run to the door to welcome me.</p>

<p>Thacker was standing under the portico, and the butler and the
other servants&mdash;a forlorn little group, it seemed to me.
Never, save on that night, have I seen tears in Thacker's eyes.</p>

<p>A few moments later I was seated alone in the high-ceilinged
dining-room, filled with shadows and memories. The candles on the
table burned without a flicker, and in their yellow light our old
butler moved noiselessly about, filling my glass and setting before
me food that I ate without knowing what it was. It had been my
privilege to dine here on Sundays, as a small boy, and on other
evenings to come in to say good-night when my father and mother
were at dessert&mdash;a good-night enriched by a walnut, or a
handful of raisins or Spanish figs. Here I had dined with my
mother, after my father's death; here Bligh had dined with us on
that night so long ago. Save for him and his letter my mother might
be opposite me now...I rose and went upstairs.</p>

<p>In my father's study, high up in the north wing, I stretched out
in a long chair under the chandelier. His spirit seemed to fill the
place: his collection of sextants in the cabinet, the astronomical
charts on the wall, the books in their tall shelves&mdash;all were
eloquent of him. I took down a leather-bound volume of Captain
Cook's <i>Voyages</i>, but found it impossible to read. I was
listening for my mother's light footstep in the passage outside,
and her voice at the door: "Roger, may I come in?" At last I took
up a candle and made my way along the hallway, passing the door of
my mother's room on the way to my own. Into her room I dared not go
that night. I fancied her there, as I had seen her a hundred times
in the past, reading in bed, with her thick hair tumbled on the
pillow, and a candle on the table at her side.</p>

<p>West winds, blowing off the Atlantic, made that December a warm
and rainy month, and I took many a long walk along the muddy lanes,
with the rain in my face and the wind moaning through the leafless
trees. A change, so gradual as to be almost imperceptible, was
coming over me; I was beginning to realize that my roots, like
those of my ancestors, were deep in this West Country soil. Tehani,
our child, the South Sea&mdash;all seemed to lose substance and
reality, fading to the ghostliness of a beautiful, half-remembered
dream. Reality lay here&mdash;in the Watchet churchyard, in
Withycombe, among the cottages of our tenants. And the solid walls
of our old house, the order preserved within, through death and
distress, brought home to me the sense of a continuity it was my
duty to preserve. Little by little my bitterness dissolved.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the month my decision was made. It cost me
dear at the time, but I have since had no cause to regret it. I
wrote to Captain Montague that I would join his ship, and enclosed
a copy of the letter in a longer one to Sir Joseph Banks. Two days
later, on a grey windless morning, I stood under the portico,
waiting for the carriage which was to take me to Taunton to catch
the London coach. The Bristol Channel lay like polished steel under
the low clouds, and the air was so still that I could hear the
cawing of the rooks from far and near. Two fishing boats were
working out to sea, their sails hanging slack, and the men at the
sweeps. I was watching them creeping laboriously toward the
Atlantic when I heard Tom's chirrup to the horses, and the sound of
wheels on the drive.</p>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h2><a name="c27" id="c27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.&mdash;EPILOGUE</h2>

<p>I joined Captain Montague's ship in January, 1793, and
hostilities broke out in the following month, the beginning of our
wars with the allied nations of Europe&mdash;the stormiest and most
critical period of British naval history, which was to culminate,
after twelve years of almost constant actions, in the great sea
fight off the coast of Spain. I had the honour of fighting the
Dutch at Camperdown, the Danes at Copenhagen, and the Spanish and
French at Trafalgar, and it was after that most glorious of
victories that I was promoted to the rank of captain.</p>

<p>Throughout the period of the wars I had many a dream of being
stationed in the Pacific upon the establishment of peace, but a sea
officer in time of war has little leisure for reflection, and as
the years passed my longing to return to the South Sea grew less
painful, and the sufferings I had endured less bitter in memory. It
was not until the summer of 1809, when in command of the
<i>Curieuse</i>, a smart frigate of thirty-two guns, captured from
the French, that my dream came true. I received orders to set sail
for Port Jackson, in New South Wales, and thence to Valparaiso,
touching at Tahiti on the way.</p>

<p>I had on board a half-company of the Seventy-third Regiment,
sent out to relieve the New South Wales Corps; the remainder of the
regiment had gone ahead, on board the ships <i>Dromedary</i> and
<i>Hindostan</i>. Four years before, through the influence of Sir
Joseph Banks, Lord Camden had appointed Captain Bligh governor of
New South Wales; now the notorious Rum Rebellion had run its
course, and a new governor, Colonel Lachlan Macquarie, had been
sent to take charge of the troubled colony. Accusing Bligh of harsh
and tyrannical misuse of his powers, Major Johnston, the senior
officer of the New South Wales Corps, and a Mr. MacArthur, the most
influential of the settlers, had seized the reins of government and
kept Bligh a prisoner in Government House for more than a year.</p>

<p>During the long voyage out, by the Cape of Good Hope and through
Bass Straits, Bligh was often in my thoughts. For his belief that I
was one of the mutineers, and my sufferings as a prisoner, I had
never blamed him at heart. But the letter to my mother, which had
certainly been the cause of her death, was another matter. I had no
desire to affront him in public, yet I knew I could never take his
hand. He had played the part of a brave captain in the wars; at
Copenhagen, Nelson had congratulated him on the quarter-deck of the
<i>Elephant</i>. But now, as his career was drawing to a close, the
history of the <i>Bounty</i> was repeating itself, and Bligh was
once more the central figure in a mutiny. I had no means of
determining the justice of the case, but the fact was strange, to
say the least.</p>

<p>We left Spithead in August, and it was not until February, 1810,
that the <i>Curieuse</i> entered the magnificent harbour of Port
Jackson, and cast anchor in Farm Cove, exchanging salutes with the
three British ships of war moored close by&mdash;the
<i>Porpoise</i>, the <i>Dromedary</i>, and the <i>Hindostan</i>.
While we were making all snug, a boat put off from the latter ship,
bringing her captain, John Pascoe, on board. Pascoe had had the
honour of serving as Nelson's flag-lieutenant at Trafalgar, and was
an old friend of mine. It was a hot day of the antipodean summer,
and a blistering sun shone down from a cloudless sky. I ushered my
guest into the cabin, where it was cooler than on deck, and ordered
the steward to make a pitcher of claret punch. Pascoe sank down on
a settee, mopping his face with a large silk handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Whew! I'll wager hell is no hotter than Sydney just now!" he
exclaimed. "And, by God, their climate is no hotter than their
politics! What have you heard of all this in England?"</p>

<p>"Only rumours; we know nothing of the truth."</p>

<p>"The truth is hard to get at, even here. No doubt there is
justice on both sides. The rum traffic has been the ruin of the
colony, and it was in the hands of the military officers. Bligh
perceived the evil and attempted to stop it, using the same famous
tact and consideration which brought on the <i>Bounty</i> mutiny.
As governor, he was invested with far more power than the King
enjoys at home, but his only means of enforcing it was the Rum
Puncheon Corps, as they are called. You know at least the result:
Bligh a prisoner in Government House, and the administration in the
hands of Major Johnston, a puppet for Mr. MacArthur, the richest
settler in the colony. A pretty mess!"</p>

<p>"What will happen now?"</p>

<p>"The Seventy-third stays here and the Cores returns to England.
Johnston, MacArthur, and Bligh will have it out at home. Colonel
Macquarie, whom I brought out, remains as governor."</p>

<p>Pascoe was eager for news from home, and we gossiped for a time.
Presently he rose. "I must be pushing off, Byam," he said: "Bligh
has ordered us to sail this afternoon."</p>

<p>When I had taken leave of him at the gangway, I ordered a boat
and went ashore to arrange for the debarkation of the troops, and
wait upon the governor. It was indeed a fiery day, and as I trudged
up the path that led to Government House I sank ankle-deep in dust.
The anteroom in which I was asked to take a chair was dark and
cool.</p>

<p>"His Excellency is occupied for the moment, Captain Byam," said
the A.D.C. who received me. He bowed and sat down to continue his
writing, and next moment, from beyond the closed door, I heard a
strident voice raised angrily. In an instant I felt myself twenty
years younger, transported as if by magic to the deck of the
<i>Bounty</i> on the afternoon before the mutiny. The same harsh
voice, unchanged by a score of years, rang out in memory, as if
repeating the words which had goaded Christian to madness: "Yes,
you bloody hound! I <i>do</i> think so. You must have stolen some
of mine or you would be able to give a better account of your own.
You're damned rascals and thieves, the lot of you!"</p>

<p>The voice in the cabinet ceased and I heard the deep,
conciliatory murmur of the governor. Then Bligh broke out again.
His grievances had lost nothing in the two years he had brooded
over them.</p>

<p>"Major Johnston, sir? By God! The man should be taken out and
shot! As for MacArthur, I took his measure the first time I laid
eyes on him. 'What, sir?' I said, 'are you to have such flocks of
sheep and cattle as no man ever heard of before? No, sir! I have
heard of you and your concerns, sir! You have got five thousand
acres of the finest land, but, by God, you shan't keep it!' 'I have
received the land by order of the Secretary of State,' replied
MacArthur, coolly, 'and on the recommendation of the Privy
Council.' 'Damn the Privy Council!' said I, 'and the Secretary of
State, too! What have they to do with me?'"</p>

<p>Again I heard the deep conciliatory murmur of the Governor's
voice, interrupted by Bligh's strident tones: "Sydney, sir? A sink
of iniquity! A more depraved, licentious lot of rascals don't
exist! The settlers? God save the mark! They're worse than the
convicts&mdash;the very scum of the earth! You must know how open I
am to mercy and compassion, but, by God, sir, such qualities are
wasted here! Rule them with a hand of iron! Rule them by fear!"</p>

<p>There was a scraping of chairs and the door was flung open. A
stout burly man in captain's uniform stood in the doorway, his face
purple with emotion and heat. Without a glance at me, he strode
truculently across the room, while the A.D.C. sprang up and
hastened to open the outer door. Captain Bligh gave him neither
word nor glance as he brushed past. Next moment he was gone. The
tired young A.D.C. closed the door, and turned to me with a faint
smile. "Thank God!" he murmured devoutly, under his breath.</p>

<p>We came in sight of Tahiti on a morning in early April, passing
to the north of Eimeo with a fine breeze at west by north. But the
wind chopped around to the east as we approached the land, and we
were all day long working up to Matavai Bay. My lieutenant, Mr.
Cobden, must have had some inkling of what was passing in my mind,
for he and the master saw to it that I was disturbed by no detail
of the working of the ship.</p>

<p>Communication with Tahiti was all but impossible in those days,
and not once, during the twenty years that had passed since I had
embraced Tehani in the <i>Pandora's</i> sick bay, had I had word of
her, or of our child. In 1796, having learned that the ship
<i>Duff</i> was to sail for Tahiti with a cargo of
missionaries,&mdash;the first in the South Sea,&mdash;I had been at
some pains to make the acquaintance of one of those worthy men, and
received his promise to search out my Indian wife and child, and
send me word of them when the ship returned to England. But no
letter came back to me. In Port Jackson, I had met and talked with
some of these same missionaries, and told them of my orders to
visit Tahiti and report on the condition of the people. Their
accounts of the island were of a most melancholy nature.
Considering their lives and those of their wives and children in
danger, the missionaries had embarked for Port Jackson on a vessel
providendaily lying at anchor in Matavai Bay. They had spent twelve
years on Tahiti, learned the language (they were kind enough to say
that my dictionary had been of the greatest aid to them), and
worked unremittingly at their task of preaching the Gospel. Yet not
a single convert had been made. War, and the diseases introduced by
the visits of European ships, had destroyed four fifths of the
people, I was told, and the future of the island appeared dark
indeed. As for Tehani, not one of the worthy missionaries had ever
heard of her, nor set foot on Taiarapu, where I supposed her still
to reside.</p>

<p>As my ship approached the land on that April afternoon, Tahiti
wore the green and smiling aspect I remembered so well, and it was
hard to believe that an island so fair to the eye could be the
scene of war and pestilence. A flood of memories overwhelmed me as
Point Venus came in sight, and One Tree Hill, and the pale green of
the shoal called Dolphin Bank. Yonder was the islet, Motu Au,
opposite Hitihiti's house; close at hand I saw Stewart's shady
glen, and the mouth of the small valley where Morrison and Millward
had resided with Poino. And closer still was the mouth of the river
in which I had first met Tehani, so long ago. I was only forty
years old,&mdash;robust and in the prime of life,&mdash;yet as I
conned the frigate through the narrow passage I knew so well, I had
the feeling which comes to very old men, of having lived too long.
Centuries seemed to have elapsed since I had looked last on the
scene now before me. I dreaded setting foot on shore.</p>

<p>It was strange as we dropped anchor to see that no canoes put
out. A few people were discernible along the beach, watching us
apathetically, but they were pitifully few beside the throngs of
former days, and where once the thatched roofs of their dwellings
had been clustered thick under the trees, there was scarcely a
house to be seen. Even the trees themselves had a withered, yellow
look, for, as I was to learn, the victorious party had hacked and
girdled nearly every breadfruit tree in Matavai.</p>

<p>At last a small patched canoe put out to us with two men on
board. They were dressed in cast-off scraps of European clothing
and were no more than beggars, for they had nothing to exchange for
what we gave them. They addressed us in broken English. I was
pleased, when they spoke together in their own tongue, to find that
I understood pretty well what they said. I inquired for Tipau,
Poino, and Hitihiti, but received only shrugs and blank stares in
reply.</p>

<p>It lacked an hour of sunset when my boat's crew landed me on
Hitihiti's point. I ordered them to await my coming on the Matavai
beach, and turned inland alone, at the very spot where the surgeon
had stumped through the sand twenty years before. Not a human being
was to be seen, nor could I find a trace of my <i>taio's</i> house.
The point, formerly covered with a well-kept lawn, was now grown
over with rank weeds, and the path leading to the temple of
Fareroi, once trodden by countless feet, was scarcely discernible.
On my way to the still reach of river where I had met Tehani, I
halted at sight of an old woman, squatting motionless on the sand
as she gazed out to sea. She looked up at me dully, but brightened
when she found that I addressed her in her own tongue, though
haltingly. Hitihiti? She had heard of him, but he was dead long
since. Hina? She shook her head. She had never heard of Tipau, but
remembered Poino well. He was dead. She shrugged her shoulders.
"Once Tahiti was a land of men," she said; "now only shadows fill
the land."</p>

<p>The river was unchanged, and though the bank was overgrown with
vegetation, I found my way to my seat among the roots of the
ancient <i>map&eacute;</i> tree. The noble tree stood firmly rooted
and flourishing, and the river ran on with the same faint murmuring
sound. But my youth was gone, and all my old friends dead. For a
moment anguish gripped me; I would have renounced my career and all
I possessed in the world to have been twenty years younger,
sporting in the river with Tehani.</p>

<p>I dared not think of her, nor of our child. I had resolved to
sail to Tautira on the morrow and dreaded what I might discover
there. Presently I rose, crossed the river at a shallow place, and
walked toward One Tree Hill. The groves of breadfruit trees which
had once provided food for innumerable people were now hacked,
yellow, and drooping; in place of scores of neat Indian cottages,
only a few filthy hovels were to be seen; and where a thousand
people had lived only twenty years before I met scarce a dozen on
my walk.</p>

<p>Proceeding down the eastern slope of One Tree Hill I soon
reached Stewart's glen where I had passed so many happy hours.
There I sat me down on a flat stone, close to the spot where his
house had once stood. Not a trace of the house remained, nor of the
garden he had tended with such care, though I found what I took to
be the remains of one of his rockeries for ferns. Stewart's bones,
overgrown with coral, lay mingled with the <i>Pandora's</i> rotting
timbers on a reef off the Australian coast. Where was Peggy? Where
was their child? The sun had set, and the shadows were deepening in
the glen. Sadly I rose and made my way over the steep rocky trail
that led to Matavai.</p>

<p>Next morning I took the pinnace and a dozen men and sailed
around the east side of Tahiti Nui to Taiarapu. The eastern coast
seemed in a more flourishing state than Matavai, and I was
agreeably surprised to find that Vehiatua's former realm had not
been desolated by war. But pestilence had done its work, and scarce
one man was to be found where five had lived in my time. As we
approached Tautira, I strained my eyes for the sight of Vehiatua's
tall house on the point. It was gone, but presently I perceived
with emotion that my own house, or one like it, stood on the spot
where I had lived. The boat grounded on the sand, while a score of
people, with brighter faces than those of Matavai, stood on the
beach to welcome us. I scanned their countenances while my heart
beat painfully, but there was no man or woman I knew. I dared not
ask for Tehani, and the missionaries in Port Jackson had informed
me that Vehiatua was dead, so, telling my people to bargain for a
supply of coconuts, I set off in search of someone known to me. The
little crowd of Indians stopped by the boat. I was glad to be left
alone.</p>

<p>I took the well-remembered path, and before I had walked halfway
to the house I met a middle-aged man of commanding presence, who
halted at sight of me. Our eyes met, and for an instant neither
spoke.</p>

<p>"Tuahu?" I said.</p>

<p>"Byam!" He stepped forward to clasp me in the Indian embrace.
There were tears in his eyes as he looked at me. Presently he said,
"Come to the house."</p>

<p>"I was on my way there," I replied, "but let us stop a moment
where we can be alone."</p>

<p>He understood perfectly what was in my mind, and waited with
downcast eyes while I mustered up courage to ask a question his
silence answered only too eloquently.</p>

<p>"Where is Tehani?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ua mate</i>&mdash;dead," he replied quietly. "She died in
the moon of Paroro, when you were three moons gone."</p>

<p>"And our child?" I asked after a long silence.</p>

<p>"She lives," said Tuahu. "A woman now, with a child of her own.
Her husband is the son of Atuanui. He will be high chief of
Taiarapu one day. You shall see your daughter presently."</p>

<p>Tuahu waited in considerate silence for me to speak. "Old friend
and kinsman," I said at last, "you know how dearly I loved her. All
these years, while my country has been engaged in constant wars, I
have dreamed of coming back. This place is a graveyard of memories,
and I have been stirred enough. I wish to see my daughter; not to
make myself known to her. To tell her that I am her father, to
embrace her, to speak with her of her mother, would be more than I
could endure. You understand?"</p>

<p>Tuahu smiled sorrowfully. "I understand," he said.</p>

<p>At that moment I heard a sound of voices on the path, and he
touched my arm. "She is coming, Byam," he said in a low voice. A
tall girl was approaching us, followed by a servant, and leading a
tiny child by the hand. Her eyes were dark blue as the sea; her
robe of snow-white cloth fell from her shoulders in graceful folds,
and on her bosom I saw a necklace of gold, curiously wrought like
the linnet seamen plait.</p>

<p>"Tehani," called the man beside me, and I caught my breath as
she turned, for she had all her dead mother's beauty, and something
of my own mother, as well. "The English captain from Matavai,"
Tuahu was saying, and she gave me her hand graciously. My
granddaughter was staring up at me in wonder, and I turned away
blindly:</p>

<p>"We must go on," said Tehani to her uncle. "I promised the child
she should see the English boat."</p>

<p>"Aye, go," replied Tuahu.</p>

<p>The moon was bright overhead when I re-embarked in the pinnace
to return to my ship. A chill night breeze came whispering down
from the depths of the valley, and suddenly the place was full of
ghosts,&mdash;shadows of men alive and dead,&mdash;my own among
them.</p>
