  <p class="first">The wind howled dismally round a house standing by itself
  almost on the shores of Barking Creek. It was the grey dusk of an early
  autumn day, and the occasional harsh cry of a sea-gull rising discordantly
  above the wind alone broke the silence of the flat, desolate waste.</p>

  <p>The house seemed deserted. Every window was shuttered; the garden was
  uncared for and a mass of weeds; the gate leading on to the road, apparently
  feeling the need of a deficient top hinge, propped itself drunkenly on what
  once had been a flower-bed. A few gloomy trees swaying dismally in the wind
  surrounded the house and completed the picture&mdash;one that would have
  caused even the least imaginative of men to draw his coat a little tighter
  round him, and feel thankful that it was not his fate to live in such a
  place.</p>

  <p>But then few people ever came near enough to the house to realise its
  sinister appearance. The road&mdash;it was little better than a cart
  track&mdash;which passed the gate, was out of the beaten way; only an
  occasional fisherman or farm labourer ever used it, and that generally by day
  when things assumed their proper proportion, and it was merely an empty house
  gradually falling to pieces through lack of attention. At night they avoided
  it if possible; folks did say that twelve years ago some prying explorer had
  found the bones of a skeleton lying on the floor in one of the upstair rooms
  with a mildewed rope fixed to one of the beams in the ceiling. And then it
  had been empty for twenty years.</p>

  <p>Even now when the wind lay in the east or north-east and the tide was
  setting in, there were those who said that you could see a light shining
  through the cracks in the shutters in that room upstairs, and that, should a
  man climb up and look in, he'd see no skeleton, but a body with purple face
  and staring eyes swinging gently to and fro, and tied by the neck to a beam
  with a rope which showed no trace of mildew. Ridiculous, of course; but then
  so many of these local superstitions are. Useful, too, in some cases; they
  afford a privacy from the prying attentions of local gossips far more cheaply
  and effectively than high walls and bolts and bars.</p>

  <p>So, at any rate, one of the two men who were walking briskly along the
  rough track seemed to think.</p>

  <p>"Admirable," he remarked, as he paused for a moment at the entrance of the
  weed-grown drive. "Quite admirable, my friend. A house situated as this one
  is, is an acquisition, and when it is haunted in addition it becomes a
  godsend."</p>

  <p>He spoke English perfectly with a slight foreign accent, and his companion
  nodded abruptly.</p>

  <p>"From what I heard about it I thought it would do," he answered.
  "Personally I think it's a damnable spot, but since you were so set against
  coming to London, I had to find somewhere in this neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>The two men started to walk slowly up the drive. Branches dripping with
  moisture brushed across their faces, and involuntarily they both turned up
  the collars of their coats.</p>

  <p>"I will explain my reasons in due course," said the first speaker shortly.
  "You may take it from me that they were good. What's that?"</p>

  <p>He swung round with a little gasp, clutching his companion's arm.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," cried the other irritably. For a moment or two they stood
  still, peering into the dark undergrowth. "What did you think it was?"</p>

  <p>"I thought I heard a bush creaking as if&mdash;as if someone was moving,"
  he said, relaxing his grip. "It must have been the wind, I suppose."</p>

  <p>He still peered fearfully into the gloomy garden, until the other man
  dragged him roughly towards the house.</p>

  <p>"Of course it was the wind," he muttered angrily. "For heaven's sake,
  Zaboleff, don't get the jumps. If you will insist on coming to an infernal
  place like this to transact a little perfectly normal business you must
  expect a few strange noises and sounds. Let's get indoors; the others should
  be here by now. It oughtn't to take more than an hour, and you can be on
  board again long before dawn."</p>

  <p>The man who had been addressed as Zaboleff ceased looking over his
  shoulder, and followed the other through a broken-down lattice-gate to the
  rear of the house. They paused in front of the back door, and on it the
  leader knocked three times in a peculiar way. It was obviously a prearranged
  signal, for almost at once stealthy steps could be heard coming along the
  passage inside. The door was cautiously pulled back a few inches, and a man
  peered out, only to throw it open wide with a faint sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"It's you, Mr. Waldock, is it?" he muttered. "Glad you've got 'ere at
  last. This place is fair giving us all the 'ump."</p>

  <p>"Evening, Jim." He stepped inside, followed by Zaboleff, and the door
  closed behind them. "Our friend's boat was a little late. Is everyone
  here?"</p>

  <p>"Yep," answered the other. "All the six of us. And I reckons we'd like to
  get it over as soon as possible. Has he "&mdash;his voice sank to a hoarse
  undertone&mdash;"has he brought the money?"</p>

  <p>"You'll all hear in good time," said Waldock curtly. "Which is the
  room?"</p>

  <p>"'Ere it is, guv'nor." Jim flung open a door. "And you'll 'ave to sit on
  the floor, as the chairs ain't safe."</p>

  <p>Two candles guttered on a square table in the centre of the room, showing
  up the faces of the five men who sat on the floor, leaning against the walls.
  Three of them were nondescript specimens of humanity of the type that may be
  seen by the thousand hurrying into the City by the early business trains.
  They were representative of the poorer type of clerk&mdash;the type which
  Woodbines its fingers to a brilliant orange; the type that screams insults at
  a football referee on Saturday afternoon. And yet to the close observer
  something more might be read on their faces: a greedy, hungry look, a shifty
  untrustworthy look&mdash;the look of those who are jealous of everyone better
  placed than themselves, but who are incapable of trying to better their own
  position except by the relative method of dragging back their more fortunate
  acquaintances; the look of little men dissatisfied not so much with their own
  littleness as with the bigness of other people. A nasty-faced trio with that
  smattering of education which is the truly dangerous thing; and&mdash;three
  of Mr. Waldock's clerks.</p>

  <p>The two others were Jews; a little flashily dressed, distinctly addicted
  to cheap jewellery. They were sitting apart from the other three, talking in
  low tones, but as the door opened their conversation ceased abruptly and they
  looked up at the newcomers with the keen, searching look of their race.
  Waldock they hardly glanced at; it was the stranger Zaboleff who riveted
  their attention. They took in every detail of the shrewd, foreign
  face&mdash;the olive skin, the dark, piercing eyes, the fine-pointed beard;
  they measured him up as a boxer measures up his opponent, or a business-man
  takes stock of the second party in a deal; then once again they conversed
  together in low tones which were barely above a whisper.</p>

  <p>It was Jim who broke the silence&mdash;Flash Jim, to give him the full
  name to which he answered in the haunts he frequented.</p>

  <p>"Wot abaht getting on with it, guv'nor?" he remarked with an attempt at a
  genial smile. "This 'ere 'ouse ain't wot I'd choose for a blooming
  'oneymoon."</p>

  <p>With an abrupt gesture Waldock silenced him and advanced to the table.</p>

  <p>"This is Mr. Zaboleff, gentlemen," he said quietly. "We are a little late,
  I am afraid, but it was unavoidable. He will explain to you now the reason
  why you were asked to come here, and not meet at our usual rendezvous in
  Soho."</p>

  <p>He stepped back a couple of paces and Zaboleff took his place. For a
  moment or two he glanced round at the faces turned expectantly towards him,
  then resting his two hands on the table in front of him, he leaned forward
  towards them.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he began, and the foreign accent seemed a little more
  pronounced, "I have asked you to come here to-night through my good friend,
  Mr. Waldock, because it has come to our ears&mdash;no matter how&mdash;that
  London is no longer a safe meeting-place. Two or three things have occurred
  lately the significance of which it is impossible to disregard."</p>

  <p>"Wot sort of things?" interrupted Flash Jim harshly.</p>

  <p>"I was about to tell you," remarked the speaker suavely, and Flash Jim
  subsided, abashed. "Our chief, with whom I spent last evening, is seriously
  concerned about these things."</p>

  <p>"You spent last night with the chief?" said Waldock, and his voice held a
  tremor of excitement, while the others leaned forward eagerly. "Is he, then,
  in Holland?"</p>

  <p>"He was at six o'clock yesterday evening," answered Zaboleff with a faint
  smile. "To-day&mdash;now&mdash;I know no more than you where he is."</p>

  <p>"Who is he&mdash;this man we're always hearing about and never seeing?"
  demanded one of the three clerks aggressively.</p>

  <p>"He is&mdash;the Chief," replied the other, while his eyes seemed to bore
  into the speaker's brain. "Just that&mdash;and no more. And that is quite
  enough for you." His glance travelled round the room, and his audience
  relaxed. "By the way, is not that a chink in the shutter there?"</p>

  <p>"All the safer," grunted Flash Jim. "Anyone passing will think the ghost
  is walking."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, kindly cover it up," ordered Zaboleff, and one of the Jews
  rose and wedged his pocket-handkerchief into the crack. There was silence in
  the room while he did so, a silence broken only by the mournful hooting of an
  owl outside.</p>

  <p>"Owls is the only things wot comes to this damned museum," said Flash Jim
  morosely. "Owls and blinkin' fools like us."</p>

  <p>"Stow it, Jim," snarled Waldock furiously. "Anyone would think you wanted
  a nurse."</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen&mdash;please." Zaboleff held up a protesting hand. "We do not
  want to prolong matters, but one or two explanations are necessary. To
  return, then, to these things that have happened recently, and which
  necessitated a fresh rendezvous for this evening&mdash;one which our friend
  Mr. Waldock so obligingly found. Three messengers sent over during the last
  three weeks bearing instructions and&mdash;what is more
  important&mdash;money, have disappeared."</p>

  <p>"Disappeared?" echoed Waldock stupidly.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely and completely. Money and all. Two more have been abominably
  ill-treated and had their money taken from them, but for some reason they
  were allowed to go free themselves. It is from them that we have obtained our
  information."</p>

  <p>"Blimey!" muttered Flash Jim; "is it the police?"</p>

  <p>"It is not the police, which is what makes it so much more serious,"
  answered Zaboleff quietly, and Flash Jim breathed a sigh of relief. "It is
  easy to keep within the law, but if our information is correct we are up
  against a body of men who are not within the law themselves. A body of men
  who are absolutely unscrupulous and utterly ruthless, a body of men who
  appear to know our secret plans as well as we do ourselves. And the
  difficulty of it is, gentlemen, that though, legally speaking, on account of
  the absurd legislation in this country we may keep within the law ourselves,
  we are hardly in a position to appeal to the police for protection. Our
  activities, though allowed officially, are hardly such as would appeal even
  to the English authorities. And on this occasion particularly that is the
  case. You may remember that the part I played in stirring up bloodshed at
  Cowdenheath a few months ago, under the name of MacTavish, caused me to be
  deported. So though our cause is legal&mdash;my presence in this country is
  not. Which was why to-night it was particularly essential that we should not
  be disturbed. Not only are we all up against this unknown gang of men, but I,
  in addition, am up against the police."</p>

  <p>"Have you any information with regard to this gang?" It was the Jew who
  had closed the chink in the shutters, speaking for the first time.</p>

  <p>"None of any use&mdash;save that they are masked in black, and cloaked in
  long black cloaks." He paused a moment as if to collect his thoughts. "They
  are all armed, and Petrovitch&mdash;he was one of the men allowed to
  escape&mdash;was very insistent on one point. It concerned the leader of the
  gang, whom he affirmed was a man of the most gigantic physical strength; a
  giant powerful as two ordinary strong men. He said...Ah! Mein
  Gott&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>His voice rose to a scream as he cowered back, while the others, with
  terror on their faces, rose hurriedly from their seats on the floor and
  huddled together in the corners of the room.</p>

  <p>In the doorway stood a huge man covered from head to foot in black. In
  each hand he held a revolver, with which he covered the eight occupants
  during the second or two which it took for half a dozen similarly disguised
  men to file past him, and take up their positions round the walls. And
  Waldock, a little more educated than the remainder of his friends, found
  himself thinking of old tales of the Spanish Inquisition and the Doges of
  Venice even as he huddled a little nearer to the table. "Stand by the table,
  all of you."</p>

  <p>It was the man at the door who spoke in a curiously deep voice, and like
  sheep they obeyed him&mdash;all save Flash Jim. For that worthy, crook though
  he was, was not without physical courage. The police he knew better than to
  play the fool with, but these were not the police.</p>

  <p>"Wot the&mdash;" he snarled, and got no farther. Something hit him behind
  the head, a thousand stars danced before his eyes, and with a strangled grunt
  he crashed forward on his face.</p>

  <p>For a moment or two there was silence, and then once again the man at the
  door spoke. "Arrange the specimens in a row."</p>

  <p>In a second the seven remaining men were marshalled in a line, while
  behind them stood six motionless black figures. And then the big man walked
  slowly down in front of them, peering into each man's face. He spoke no word
  until he reached the end of the line, and then, his inspection concluded, he
  stepped back and leaned against the wall facing them.</p>

  <p>"A nauseating collection," he remarked thoughtfully. "A loathsome brood.
  What are the three undersized and shivering insects on the right?"</p>

  <p>"Those are three of my clerks," said Waldock with an assumption of angry
  bravado. "And I would like to know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In good time you will," answered the deep voice. "Three of your clerks,
  are they; imbued with your rotten ideas, I suppose, and yearning to follow in
  father's footsteps? Have we anything particular against them?"</p>

  <p>There was no answer from the masked men, and the leader made a sign.
  Instantly the three terrified clerks were seized from behind and brought up
  to him, where they stood trembling and shaking in every limb.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, you three little worms." With an effort they pulled
  themselves together: a ray of hope was dawning in their minds&mdash;perhaps
  they were going to be let off easily. "My friends and I do not like you or
  your type. You meet in secret places and in your slimy minds you concoct foul
  schemes which, incredible though it may seem, have so far had more than a
  fair measure of success in this country. But your main idea is not the
  schemes, but the money you are paid to carry them out. This is your first and
  last warning. Another time you will be treated differently. Get out of here.
  And see you don't stop."</p>

  <p>The door closed behind them and two of the masked men; there was the sound
  as of a boot being used with skill and strength, and cries of pain; then the
  door reopened and the masked men returned.</p>

  <p>"They have gone," announced one of them. "We helped them on their
  way."</p>

  <p>"Good," said the leader. "Let us continue the inspection. What are these
  two Hebrews?"</p>

  <p>A man from behind stepped forward and examined them slowly; then he came
  up to the leader and whispered in his ear.</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" A new and terrible note had crept into the deep voice. "My
  friends and I do not like your trade, you swine. It is well that we have come
  provided with the necessary implement for such a case. Fetch the cat."</p>

  <p>In silence one of the men left the room, and as his full meaning came home
  to the two Jews they flung themselves grovelling on the floor, screaming for
  mercy.</p>

  <p>"Gag them."</p>

  <p>The order came out sharp and clear, and in an instant the two writhing men
  were seized and gagged. Only their rolling eyes and trembling hands showed
  the terror they felt as they dragged themselves on their knees towards the
  impassive leader.</p>

  <p>"The cat for cases of this sort is used legally," he remarked. "We merely
  anticipate the law."</p>

  <p>With a fresh outburst of moans the two Jews watched the door open and the
  inexorable black figure come in, holding in his hand a short stick from which
  nine lashes hung down.</p>

  <p>"Heavens!" gasped Waldock, starting forward. "What are you going to
  do?"</p>

  <p>"Flog them to within an inch of their lives," said the deep voice. "It is
  the punishment for their method of livelihood. Five and six&mdash;take
  charge. After you have finished remove them in Number 3 car, and drop them in
  London."</p>

  <p>Struggling impotently, the Jews were led away, and the leader passed on to
  the remaining two men.</p>

  <p>"So, Zaboleff, you came after all. Unwise, surely, in view of the
  police?"</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" muttered Zaboleff, his lips trembling.</p>

  <p>"A specimen hunter," said the other suavely. "I am making a collection of
  people like you. The police of our country are unduly kind to your breed,
  although they would not have been kind to you to-night, Zaboleff, unless I
  had intervened. But I couldn't let them have you; you're such a very choice
  specimen. I don't think somehow that you've worked this little flying visit
  of yours very well. Of course I knew about it, but I must confess I was
  surprised when I found that the police did too."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" demanded the other hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"I mean that when we arrived here we found to our surprise that the police
  had forestalled us. Popular house, this, to-night."</p>

  <p>"The police!" muttered Waldock dazedly.</p>

  <p>"Even so&mdash;led by no less a personage than Inspector McIver. They had
  completely surrounded the house, and necessitated a slight change in my
  plans."</p>

  <p>"Where are they now?" cried Waldock.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Where indeed? Let us trust at any rate in comfort."</p>

  <p>"By heaven!" said Zaboleff, taking a step forward. "As I asked you
  before&mdash;who are you?"</p>

  <p>"And as I told you before, Zaboleff, a collector of specimens. Some I
  keep; some I let go&mdash;as you have already seen."</p>

  <p>"And what are you going to do with me?"</p>

  <p>"Keep you. Up to date you are the cream of my collection."</p>

  <p>"Are you working with the police?" said the other dazedly.</p>

  <p>"Until to-night we have not clashed. Even to-night, well, I think we are
  working towards the same end. And do you know what that end is, Zaboleff?"
  The deep voice grew a little sterner. "It is the utter, final overthrow of
  you and all that you stand for. To achieve that object we shall show no
  mercy. Even as you are working in the dark&mdash;so are we. Already you are
  frightened; already we have proved that you fear the unknown more than you
  fear the police; already the first few tricks are ours. But you still hold
  the ace, Zaboleff&mdash;or shall we say the King of Trumps? And when we catch
  him you will cease to be the cream of my collection. This leader of
  yours&mdash;it was what Petrovitch told him, I suppose, that made him send
  you over."</p>

  <p>"I refuse to say," said the other.</p>

  <p>"You needn't; it is obvious. And now that you are caught&mdash;he will
  come himself. Perhaps not at once&mdash;but he will come. And then...But we
  waste time. The money, Zaboleff."</p>

  <p>"I have no money," he snarled.</p>

  <p>"You lie, Zaboleff. You lie clumsily. You have quite a lot of money
  brought over for Waldock so that he might carry on the good work after you
  had sailed to-morrow. Quick, please; time passes."</p>

  <p>With a curse Zaboleff produced a small canvas bag and held it out. The
  other took it and glanced inside.</p>

  <p>"I see," he said gravely. "Pearls and precious stones. Belonging once, I
  suppose, to a murdered gentlewoman whose only crime was that she, through no
  action of her own, was born in a different sphere from you. And, you reptile
  "&mdash;his voice rose a little&mdash;"you would do that here."</p>

  <p>Zaboleff shrank back, and the other laughed contemptuously. "Search
  him&mdash;and Waldock too."</p>

  <p>Two men stepped forward quickly. "Nothing more," they said after a while.
  "Except this piece of paper."</p>

  <p>There was a sudden movement on Zaboleff's part&mdash;instantly suppressed,
  but not quite soon enough.</p>

  <p>"Injudicious," said the leader quietly. "Memory is better. An address, I
  see&mdash;No. 5, Green Street, Hoxton. A salubrious neighbourhood, with which
  I am but indifferently acquainted. Ah! I see my violent friend has
  recovered." He glanced at Flash Jim, who was sitting up dazedly, rubbing the
  back of his head. "Number 4&mdash;the usual."</p>

  <p>There was a slight struggle, and Flash Jim lay back peacefully
  unconscious, while a faint smell of chloroform filled the room.</p>

  <p>"And now I think we will go. A most successful evening."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with me, you scoundrel?" spluttered Waldock. "I
  warn you that I have influential friends, who&mdash;who will ask questions
  in&mdash;in Parliament if you do anything to me; who will go to Scotland
  Yard."</p>

  <p>"I can assure you, Mr. Waldock, that I will make it my personal business
  to see that their natural curiosity is gratified," answered the leader
  suavely. "But for the present I fear the three filthy rags you edit will have
  to be content with the office boy as their guiding light. And I venture to
  think they will not suffer."</p>

  <p>He made a sudden sign, and before they realised what was happening the two
  men were caught from behind and gagged. The next instant they were rushed
  through the door, followed by Flash Jim. For a moment or two the eyes of the
  leader wandered round the now empty room taking in every detail: then he
  stepped forward and blew out the two candles. The door closed gently behind
  him, and a couple of minutes later two cars stole quietly away from the
  broken-down gate along the cart track. It was just midnight, behind them the
  gloomy house stood up gaunt and forbidding against the darkness of the night
  sky. And it was not until the leading car turned carefully into the main road
  that anyone spoke.</p>

  <p>"Deuced awkward, the police being there."</p>

  <p>The big man who was driving grunted thoughtfully. "Perhaps," he returned.
  "Perhaps not. Anyway, the more the merrier. Flash Jim all right?"</p>

  <p>"Sleeping like a child," answered the other, peering into the body of the
  car.</p>

  <p>For about ten miles they drove on in silence: then at a main cross-roads
  the car pulled up and the big man got out. The second car was just behind,
  and for a few moments there was a whispered conversation between him and the
  other driver. He glanced at Zaboleff and Waldock, who appeared to be
  peacefully sleeping on the back seat, and smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"Good night, old man. Report as usual."</p>

  <p>"Right," answered the driver. "So long."</p>

  <p>The second car swung right-handed and started northwards, while the leader
  stood watching the vanishing tail lamp. Then he returned to his own seat, and
  soon the first beginnings of outer London were reached. And it was as they
  reached Whitechapel that the leader spoke again with a note of suppressed
  excitement in his voice.</p>

  <p>"We're worrying 'em; we're worrying 'em badly. Otherwise they'd never have
  sent Zaboleff. He was too big a man to risk, considering the police."</p>

  <p>"It's the police that I am considering," said his companion.</p>

  <p>The big man laughed.</p>

  <p>"Leave that to me, old man, leave that entirely to me."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2">II. &mdash; IN WHICH SCOTLAND YARD<br>
  SITS UP AND TAKES NOTICE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Sir Bryan Johnstone leaned back in his chair and stared at
  the ceiling with a frown. His hands were thrust deep into his trouser
  pockets; his long legs were stretched out to their full extent under the big
  roll-top desk in front of him. From the next room came the monotonous tapping
  of a typewriter, and after a while Sir Bryan closed his eyes.</p>

  <p>Through the open window there came the murmur of the London
  traffic&mdash;that soothing sound so conducive to sleep in those who have
  lunched well. But that did not apply to the man lying back in his chair. Sir
  Bryan's lunch was always a frugal meal, and it was no desire for sleep that
  made the Director of Criminal Investigation close his eyes. He was puzzled,
  and the report lying on the desk in front of him was the reason.</p>

  <p>For perhaps ten minutes he remained motionless, then he leaned forward and
  touched an electric bell. Instantly the typewriter ceased, and a girl
  secretary came quickly into the room.</p>

  <p>"Miss Forbes," said Sir Bryan, "I wish you would find out if Chief
  Inspector McIver is in the building. If so, I would like to see him at once;
  if not, see that he gets the message as soon as he comes in."</p>

  <p>The door closed behind the girl, and after a moment or two the man rose
  from his desk and began to pace up and down the room with long, even strides.
  Every now and then he would stop and stare at some print on the wall, but it
  was the blank stare of a man whose mind is engrossed in other matters.</p>

  <p>And once while he stood looking out of the window, he voiced his thoughts,
  unconscious that he spoke aloud. "Dash it, McIver's not fanciful. He's the
  least fanciful man we've got. And yet..."</p>

  <p>His eyes came round to the desk once more, the desk on which the report
  was lying. It was Inspector McIver's report&mdash;hence his instructions to
  the secretary. It was the report on a very strange matter which had taken
  place the previous night, and after a while Sir Bryan picked up the typed
  sheets and glanced through them again. And he was still standing by the desk,
  idly turning over the pages, when the secretary came into the room.</p>

  <p>"Chief Inspector McIver is here. Sir Bryan," she announced.</p>

  <p>"Tell him to come in, Miss Forbes."</p>

  <p>Certainly the Inspector justified his Chief's spoken thought&mdash;a less
  fanciful looking man it would have been hard to imagine. A square-jawed,
  rugged Scotchman, he looked the type to whom Holy Writ was Holy Writ only in
  so far as it could be proved. He was short and thick-set, and his physical
  strength was proverbial. But a pair of kindly twinkling eyes belied the gruff
  voice. In fact, the gruff voice was a pose specially put on which deceived no
  one; his children all imitated it to his huge content, though he endeavoured
  to look ferocious when they did so. In short, McIver, though shrewd and
  relentless when on duty, was the kindest-hearted of men. But he was most
  certainly not fanciful.</p>

  <p>"What the dickens is all this about, McIver?" said Sir Bryan with a smile,
  when the door had shut behind the secretary.</p>

  <p>"I wish I knew myself, sir," returned the other seriously. "I've never
  been so completely defeated in my life."</p>

  <p>Sir Bryan waved him to a chair and sat down at the desk. "I've read your
  report," he said, still smiling, "and frankly, McIver, if it had been anyone
  but you, I should have been annoyed. But I know you far too well for that.
  Look here "&mdash;he pushed a box of cigarettes across the table&mdash;"take
  a cigarette and your time and let's hear about it."</p>

  <p>McIver lit a cigarette and seemed to be marshalling his thoughts. He was a
  man who liked to tell his story in his own way, and his chief waited
  patiently till he was ready. He knew that when his subordinate did start he
  would get a clear, concise account of what had taken place, with everything
  irrelevant ruthlessly cut out. And if there was one thing that roused Sir
  Bryan to thoughts of murder and violence, it was a rambling, incoherent
  statement from one of his men.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," began McIver at length, "this is briefly what took place. At
  ten o'clock last night as we had arranged, we completely surrounded the
  suspected house on the outskirts of Barking. I had had a couple of good men
  on duty there lying concealed the whole day, and when I arrived at about
  nine-thirty with Sergeant Andrews and half a dozen others, they reported to
  me that at least eight men were inside, and that Zaboleff was one of them. He
  had been shadowed the whole way down from Limehouse with another man, and
  both the watchers were positive that he had not left the house. So I posted
  my men and crept forward to investigate myself. There was a little chink in
  the wooden shutters of one of the downstairs rooms through which the light
  was streaming. I took a glimpse through, and found that everything was just
  as had been reported to me. There were eight of them there, and an
  unpleasant-looking bunch they were, too. Zaboleff I saw at the head of the
  table, and standing next to him was that man Waldock who runs two or three of
  the worst Red papers. There was also Flash Jim, and I began to wish I'd
  brought a few more men."</p>

  <p>McIver smiled ruefully. "It was about the last coherent wish I remember.
  And," he went on seriously, "what I'm going to tell you now, sir, may seem
  extraordinary and what one would expect in detective fiction, but as sure as
  I am sitting in this chair, it is what actually took place. Somewhere from
  close to, there came the sound of an owl hooting. At that same moment I
  distinctly heard the noise of what seemed like a scuffle, and a stifled
  curse. And then, and this is what beats me, sir." McIver pounded a huge fist
  into an equally huge palm. "I was picked up from behind as if I were a baby.
  Yes, sir, a baby."</p>

  <p>Involuntarily Sir Bryan smiled. "You make a good substantial infant,
  McIver."</p>

  <p>"Exactly, sir," grunted the Inspector. "If a man had suggested such a
  thing to me yesterday I'd have laughed in his face. But the fact remains that
  I was picked up just like a child in arms, and doped, sir, doped. Me&mdash;at
  my time of life. They chloroformed me, and that was the last I saw of
  Zaboleff or the rest of the gang."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but it's the rest of the report that beats me," said his chief
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>'"So it does me, sir," agreed McIver. "When I came to myself early this
  morning I didn't realise where I was. Of course my mind at once went back to
  the preceding night, and what with feeling sick as the result of the
  chloroform, and sicker at having been fooled, I wasn't too pleased with
  myself. And then I rubbed my eyes and pinched myself, and for a moment or two
  I honestly thought I'd gone off my head. There was I sitting on my own front
  door step, with a cushion all nicely arranged for my head and every single
  man I'd taken down with me asleep on the pavement outside. I tell you, sir, I
  looked at those eight fellows all ranged in a row for about five minutes
  before my brain began to act. I was simply stupefied. And then I began to
  feel angry. To be knocked on the head by a crew like Flash Jim might happen
  to anybody. But to be treated like naughty children and sent home to bed was
  a bit too much. Dammit, I thought, while they were about it, why didn't they
  tuck me up with my wife."</p>

  <p>Once again Sir Bryan smiled, but the other was too engrossed to
  notice.</p>

  <p>"It was then I saw the note," continued McIver. He fumbled in his pocket,
  and his chief stretched out his hand to see the original. He already knew the
  contents almost by heart, and the actual note itself threw no additional
  light on the matter. It was typewritten, and the paper was such as can be
  bought by the ream at any cheap stationer's.</p>

  <p>"To think of an old bird like you, Mac," it ran, "going and showing
  yourself up in a chink of light. You must tell Mrs. Mac to get some more
  cushions. There were only enough in the parlour for you and Andrews. I have
  taken Zaboleff and Waldock, and I dropped Flash Jim in Piccadilly Circus. I
  flogged two of the others whose method of livelihood failed to appeal to me;
  the remaining small fry I turned loose. Cheerio, old son. The fellow in St.
  James makes wonderful pick-me-ups for the morning after. Hope I didn't hurt
  you."</p>

  <p>Idly Sir Bryan studied the note, holding it up to the light to see if
  there was any water-mark on the paper which might help. Then he studied the
  typed words, and finally with a slight shrug of his shoulders he laid it on
  the desk in front of him.</p>

  <p>"An ordinary Remington, I should think. And as there are several thousands
  in use it doesn't help much. What about Flash Jim?"</p>

  <p>McIver shook his head. "The first thing I did, sir, was to run him to
  ground. And I put it across him good and strong. He admitted everything:
  admitted he was down there, but over the rest of the show he swore by
  everything that he knew no more than I did. All he could say was that
  suddenly the room seemed full of men. And the men were all masked. Then he
  got a clip over the back of the head, and he remembers nothing more till the
  policeman on duty at Piccadilly Circus woke him with his boot just before
  dawn this morning."</p>

  <p>"Which fact, of course, you have verified," said Sir Bryan.</p>

  <p>"At once, sir," answered the other. "For once in his life Flash Jim
  appears to be speaking the truth. Which puts a funny complexion on matters,
  sir, if he is speaking the truth."</p>

  <p>The Inspector leaned forward and stared at his chief.</p>

  <p>"You've heard the rumours, sir," he went on after a moment, "the same as I
  have."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said Sir Bryan quietly. "But go on, McIver. I'd like to hear
  what's on your mind."</p>

  <p>"It's the Black Gang, sir," said the Inspector, leaning forward
  impressively. "There have been rumours going round, rumours which our men
  have heard here and there for the past two months. I've heard 'em myself; and
  once or twice I've wondered. Now I'm sure&mdash;especially after what Flash
  Jim said. That gang is no rumour, it's solid fact."</p>

  <p>"Have you any information as to what their activities have been, assuming
  for a moment it is the truth?" asked Sir Bryan.</p>

  <p>"None for certain, sir; until this moment I wasn't certain of its
  existence. But now&mdash;looking back&mdash;there have been quite a number of
  sudden disappearances. We haven't troubled officially, we haven't been asked
  to. Hardly likely when one realises who the people are who have
  disappeared."</p>

  <p>"All conjecture, McIver," said Sir Bryan. "They may be lying doggo, or
  they'll turn up elsewhere."</p>

  <p>"They may be, sir," answered McIver doggedly. "But take the complete
  disappearance of Granger a fortnight ago. He's one of the worst of the Red
  men, and we know he hasn't left the country. Where is he? His wife, I happen
  to know, is crazy with anxiety, so it doesn't look like a put-up job. Take
  that extraordinary case of the Pole who was found lashed to the railings in
  Whitehall with one half of his beard and hair shaved off and the motto
  'Portrait of a Bolshevist' painted on his forehead. Well, I don't need to
  tell you, sir, that that particular Pole, Strambowski, was undoubtedly a
  messenger, between&mdash;well, we know who between and what the message was.
  And then take last night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, what about last night?"</p>

  <p>"For the first time this gang has come into direct contact with us."</p>

  <p>"Always assuming the fact of its existence."</p>

  <p>"Exactly, sir," answered McIver. "Well, they've got Zaboleff and they've
  got Waldock, and they laid eight of us out to cool. I guess they're not to be
  sneezed at."</p>

  <p>With a thoughtful look on his face Sir Bryan rose and strolled over to the
  window. Though not prepared to go quite as far as McIver, there were
  certainly some peculiar elements in the situation&mdash;elements which he, as
  head of a big public department, could not officially allow for an instant,
  however much it might amuse him as a private individual.</p>

  <p>"We must find Zaboleff and Waldock," he said curtly, without turning
  round. "Waldock, at any rate, has friends who will make a noise unless he's
  forthcoming. And..."</p>

  <p>But his further remarks were interrupted by the entrance of his secretary
  with a note.</p>

  <p>"For the Inspector, Sir Bryan," she said, and McIver, after a glance at
  his chief, opened the envelope. For a while he studied the letter in silence,
  then with an enigmatic smile he rose and handed it to the man by the
  window.</p>

  <p>"No answer, thank you. Miss Forbes," he said, and when they were once more
  alone, he began rubbing his hands together softly&mdash;a sure sign of being
  excited. "Curtis and Samuel Bauer, both flogged nearly to death and found in
  a slum off Whitechapel. The note said two of 'em had been flogged."</p>

  <p>"So," said Sir Bryan quietly. "These two were at Barking last night?"</p>

  <p>"They were, sir," answered the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"And their line?" queried the Chief.</p>

  <p>"White Slave Traffic of the worst type," said McIver. "They generally drug
  the girls with cocaine or some dope first. What do you say to my theory now,
  sir?"</p>

  <p>"It's another point in its favour, McIver," conceded Sir Bryan cautiously:
  "but it still wants a lot more proof. And, anyway, whether you're right or
  not, we can't allow it to continue. We shall be having questions asked in
  Parliament."</p>

  <p>McIver nodded portentously. "If I can't lay my hands on a man who can lift
  me up like a baby and dope me, may I never have another case. Like a baby,
  sir. Me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He opened his hands out helplessly, and this time Sir Bryan laughed
  outright, only to turn with a quick frown as the door leading to the
  secretary's office was flung open to admit a man. He caught a vague glimpse
  of the scandalised Miss Forbes hovering like a canary eating bird-seed in the
  background: then he turned to the newcomer. "Confound it, Hugh," he cried.
  "I'm busy."</p>

  <p>Hugh Drummond grinned all over his face, and lifting a hand like a leg of
  mutton he smote Sir Bryan in the back, to the outraged amazement of Inspector
  McIver.</p>

  <p>"You priceless old bean," boomed Hugh affably. "I gathered from the female
  bird punching the what-not outside that the great brain was
  heaving&mdash;but, my dear old lad, I have come to report a crime. A crime
  which I positively saw committed with my own eyes: an outrage: a blot upon
  this fair land of ours."</p>

  <p>He sank heavily into a chair and selected a cigarette. He was a vast
  individual with one of those phenomenally ugly faces which is rendered
  utterly pleasant by the extraordinary charm of its owner's expression. No
  human being had ever been known to be angry with Hugh for long. He was either
  moved to laughter by the perennial twinkle in the big man's blue eyes, or he
  was stunned by a playful blow on the chest from a fist which rivalled a steam
  hammer. Of brain he apparently possessed a minimum: of muscle he possessed
  about five ordinary men's share.</p>

  <p>And yet unlike so many powerful men his quickness on his feet was
  astounding&mdash;as many a good heavyweight boxer had found to his cost. In
  the days of his youth Hugh Drummond&mdash;known more familiarly to his
  intimates at Bulldog&mdash;had been able to do the hundred in a shade over
  ten seconds. And though the mere thought of such a performance now would have
  caused him to break out into a cold sweat, he was still quite capable of a
  turn of speed which many a lighter-built man would have envied.</p>

  <p>Between him and Sir Bryan Johnstone existed one of those friendships which
  are founded on totally dissimilar tastes. He had been Bryan Johnstone's fag
  at school, and for some inscrutable reason the quiet scholarship of the elder
  boy had appealed to the kid of fourteen who was even then a mass of brawn.
  And when one day Johnstone, going about his lawful occasions as a prefect,
  discovered young Drummond reducing a boy two years older than himself to a
  fair semblance of a jelly, the appeal was reciprocated.</p>

  <p>"He called you a scut," said Drummond a little breathlessly when his lord
  and master mildly inquired the reason of the disturbance. "So I scutted
  him."</p>

  <p>It was only too true, and with a faint smile Johnstone watched the
  "scutted" one depart with undignified rapidity. Then he looked at his
  fag.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Drummond," he remarked awkwardly.</p>

  <p>"Rot. That's all right," returned the other, blushing uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>And that was all. But it started then, and it never died, though their
  ways lay many poles apart. To Johnstone a well-deserved knighthood and a high
  position in the land: to Drummond as much money as he wanted and a life of
  sport.</p>

  <p>"Has someone stolen the goldfish?" queried Sir Bryan with mild
  sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"Great Scott! I hope not," cried Hugh in alarm. "Phyllis gave me complete
  instructions about the brutes before she toddled off. I make a noise like an
  ant's egg, and drop them in the sink every morning. No, old lad of the
  village, it is something of vast import: a stain upon the escutcheon of your
  force. Last night&mdash;let us whisper it in Gath&mdash;I dined and further
  supped not wisely but too well. In fact I deeply regret to admit that I
  became a trifle blotto&mdash;not to say tanked. Of course it wouldn't have
  happened if Phyllis had been propping up the jolly old home, don't you know:
  but she's away in the country with the nightingales and slugs and things.
  Well, as I say, in the young hours of the morning I thought I'd totter along
  home. I'd been with some birds&mdash;male birds, Tumkins"&mdash;he stared
  sternly at Sir Bryan, while McIver stiffened into rigid horror at such an
  incredible nickname&mdash;"male birds, playing push halfpenny or some such
  game of skill or chance. And when I left it was about two a.m. Well, I
  wandered along through Leicester Square, and stopped just outside Scott's to
  let one of those watering carts water my head for me. Deuced considerate
  driver he was too: stopped his horse for a couple of minutes and let one jet
  play on me uninterruptedly. Well, as I say, while I was lying in the road,
  steaming at the brow, a motor-car went past, and it stopped in Piccadilly
  Circus."</p>

  <p>McIver's air of irritation vanished suddenly, and a quick glance passed
  between him and Sir Bryan.</p>

  <p>"Nothing much you observe in that, Tumkins," he burbled on, quite
  unconscious of the sudden attention of his hearers. "But wait, old
  lad&mdash;I haven't got to the motto yet. From this car there stepped large
  numbers of men: at least, so it seemed to me, and you must remember I'd
  recently had a shampoo. And just as I got abreast of them they lifted out
  another warrior, who appeared to me to be unconscious. At first I thought
  there were two, until I focused the old optics and found I'd been squinting.
  They put him on the pavement and got back into the car again just as I
  tottered alongside.</p>

  <p>"'What ho! souls,' I murmured, 'what is this and that, so to speak?'</p>

  <p>"'Binged, old bean, badly binged,' said the driver of the car. 'We're
  leaving him there to cool.'</p>

  <p>"And with that the car drove off. There was I, Tumkins, in a partially
  binged condition alone in Piccadilly Circus with a bird in a completely
  binged condition.</p>

  <p>"'How now,' I said to myself. 'Shall I go and induce yon water merchant to
  return?'&mdash;as a matter of fact I was beginning to feel I could do with
  another whack myself&mdash;' or shall I leave you here&mdash;as your pals
  observed&mdash;to cool?'</p>

  <p>"I bent over him as I pondered this knotty point, and as, I did so,
  Tumkins, I became aware of a strange smell."</p>

  <p>Hugh paused dramatically and selected another cigarette, while Sir Bryan
  flashed a quick glance of warning at McIver, who was obviously bursting with
  suppressed excitement.</p>

  <p>"A peculiar and sickly odour, Tumkins," resumed the speaker with maddening
  deliberation. "A strange and elusive perfume. For a long while it eluded
  me&mdash;that smell: I just couldn't place it. And then suddenly I got it:
  right in the middle, old boy&mdash;plumb in the centre of the windpipe. It
  was chloroform: the bird wasn't drunk&mdash;he was doped."</p>

  <p>Completely exhausted Hugh lay back in his chair, and once again Sir Bryan
  flashed a warning glance at his exasperated subordinate.</p>

  <p>"Would you be able to recognise any of the men in the car if you saw them
  again?" he asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"I should know the driver," answered Hugh after profound thought. "And the
  bird beside him. But not the others."</p>

  <p>"Did you take the number of the car?" snapped McIver.</p>

  <p>"My dear old man," murmured Hugh in a pained voice, "who on earth ever
  does take the number of a car? Except your warriors, who always get it wrong.
  Besides, as I tell you, I was partially up the pole."</p>

  <p>"What did you do then?" asked Sir Bryan.</p>

  <p>"Well, I brought the brain to bear," answered Hugh, "and decided there was
  nothing to do. He was doped, and I was bottled&mdash;so by a unanimous
  casting vote of one&mdash;I toddled off home. But Tumkins, while I was
  feeding the goldfish this morning&mdash;or rather after
  lunch&mdash;conscience was gnawing at my vitals. And after profound
  meditation, and consulting with my fellow Denny, I decided that the call of
  duty was clear. I came to you, Tumkins, as a child flies to its mother. Who
  better, I thought, than old Tum-tum to listen to my maidenly secrets? And
  so..."</p>

  <p>"One moment, Hugh," Sir Bryan held up his hand. "Do you mind if I speak to
  Inspector McIver for a moment?"</p>

  <p>"Anything you like, old lad," murmured Drummond. "But be merciful.
  Remember my innocent wife in the country."</p>

  <p>And silence settled on the room, broken only by the low-voiced
  conversation between McIver and his chief in the window. By their gestures it
  seemed as if Sir Bryan was suggesting something to his subordinate to which
  that worthy officer was a little loath to agree. And after a while a
  strangled snore from the chair announced that Drummond was ceasing to take an
  intelligent interest in things mundane.</p>

  <p>"He's an extraordinary fellow, McIver," said Sir Bryan, glancing at the
  sleeper with a smile. "I've known him since we were boys at school. And he's
  not quite such a fool as he makes himself out. You remember that
  extraordinary case over the man Peterson a year or so ago. Well, it was he
  who did the whole thing. His complete disability to be cunning utterly
  defeated that master-crook, who was always looking for subtlety that wasn't
  there. And of course his strength is absolutely phenomenal."</p>

  <p>"I know, sir," said McIver doubtfully, "but would he consent to take on
  such a job&mdash;and do exactly as he was told?"</p>

  <p>They were both looking out of the window, while in the room behind them
  the heavy breathing of the sleeper rose and fell monotonously. And when the
  whole audience is asleep it ceases to be necessary to talk in undertones.
  Which was why Sir Bryan and the Inspector during the next ten minutes
  discussed certain matters of import which they would not have discussed
  through megaphones at the Savoy. They concerned Hugh and other things, and
  the other things particularly were of interest. And they continued discussing
  these other things until, with a dreadful noise like a racing motor
  back-firing, the sleeper sat up in his chair and stretched himself.</p>

  <p>"Tumkins," he cried. "I have committed sacrilege. I have slept in the Holy
  of Holies. Have you decided on my fate? Am I to be shot at dawn?"</p>

  <p>Sir Bryan left the window and sat down at his desk. For a moment or two he
  rubbed his chin thoughtfully with his left hand, as if trying to make up his
  mind: then he lay back in his chair and stared at his erstwhile fag.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to do a job of work, old man?"</p>

  <p>Hugh started as if he had been stung by a wasp, and Sir Bryan smiled.</p>

  <p>"Not real work," he said reassuringly. "But by mere luck last night you
  saw something which Inspector McIver would have given a good deal to see. Or
  to be more accurate, you saw some men whom McIver particularly wants to
  meet."</p>

  <p>"Those blokes in the car you mean," cried Hugh brightly.</p>

  <p>"Those blokes in the car," agreed the other. "Incidentally, I may say
  there was a good deal more in that little episode than you think: and after
  consultation with McIver I have decided to tell you a certain amount about
  it, because you can help us, Hugh. You see you're one up on McIver: you have
  at any rate seen those men and he hasn't. Moreover, you say you could
  recognise two of them again."</p>

  <p>"Good heavens! Tumkins," murmured Hugh aghast, "don't say you want me to
  tramp the streets of London looking for them."</p>

  <p>Sir Bryan smiled. "We'll spare you that," he answered. "But I'd like you
  to pay attention to what I'm going to tell you."</p>

  <p>Hugh's face assumed the look of intense pain always indicative of thought
  in its owner. "Carry on, old bird," he remarked. "I'll try and last the
  course."</p>

  <p>"Last night," began Sir Bryan quietly, "a very peculiar thing happened to
  McIver. I won't worry you with the full details, and it will be enough if I
  just give you a bare outline of what occurred. He and some of his men in the
  normal course of duty surrounded a certain house in which were some people we
  wanted to lay our hands on. To be more accurate there was one man there whom
  we wanted. He'd been shadowed ever since he'd landed in England that morning,
  shadowed the whole way from the docks to the house. And sure enough when
  McIver and his men surrounded the house, there was our friend and all his
  pals in one of the downstairs rooms. It was then that this peculiar thing
  happened. I gather from McIver that he heard the noise of an owl hooting,
  also a faint scuffle and a curse. And after that he heard nothing more. He
  was chloroformed from behind, and went straight out of the picture."</p>

  <p>"Great Scott!" murmured Hugh, staring incredulously at McIver. "What an
  amazing thing!"</p>

  <p>"And this is where you come in, Hugh," continued Sir Bryan.</p>

  <p>"Me!" Hugh sat up abruptly. "Why me?"</p>

  <p>"One of the men inside the room was an interesting fellow known as Flash
  Jim. He is a burglar of no mean repute, though he is quite ready to tackle
  any sort of job which carries money with it. And when McIver, having
  recovered himself this morning, ran Flash Jim to ground in one of his haunts
  he was quite under the impression that the men who had doped him and the
  other officers were pals of Flash Jim. But after he'd talked to him he
  changed his mind. All Flash Jim could tell him was that on the previous night
  he and some friends had been discussing business at this house. He didn't
  attempt to deny that. He went on to say that suddenly the room had been
  filled with a number of masked men, and that he'd had a clip over the back of
  the head which knocked him out. After that presumably he was given a whiff of
  chloroform to keep him quiet, and the next thing he remembers is being kicked
  into activity by the policeman at&mdash;" Sir Bryan paused a moment to
  emphasise the point&mdash;"at Piccadilly Circus."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" said Hugh dazedly. "Then that bird I saw last night sleeping
  it off on the pavement was Flash Jim."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," answered Sir Bryan. "But what is far more to the point, old
  man, is that the two birds you think you would be able to recognise and who
  were in the car, are two of the masked men who first of all laid out McIver
  and subsequently surrounded Flash Jim and his pals inside."</p>

  <p>"But what did they want to do that for?" asked Hugh in bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"That is just what we want to find out," replied Sir Bryan. "As far as we
  can see at the moment they are not criminals in the accepted sense of the
  word. They flogged two of the men who were there last night, and there are no
  two men in England who more richly deserved it. They kidnapped two others,
  one of whom was the man we particularly wanted. Then to wind up, they planted
  Flash Jim as I've told you, let the others go, and brought McIver and all his
  men back to McIver's house, where they left them to cool on the
  pavement."</p>

  <p>For a moment there was silence, and then Hugh began to shake with
  laughter.</p>

  <p>"But how perfectly priceless!" he spluttered when he was able to speak
  once more. "Old Algy will burst a blood-vessel when I tell him: you know,
  Algy, Tumkins, don't you&mdash;that bird with the eye-glass, and the funny-
  looking face?"</p>

  <p>Inspector McIver frowned heavily. All along he had doubted the wisdom of
  telling Drummond anything: now he felt that his misgivings were confirmed.
  What on earth was the good of expecting such an obvious ass to be of the
  smallest assistance? And now this raucous hilarity struck him as being
  positively indecent. But the Chief had insisted: the responsibility was his.
  One thing was certain, reflected McIver grimly. Algy, whoever he was, would
  not be the only one to whom the privilege of bursting a blood-vessel would be
  accorded. And before very long it would be all round London&mdash;probably in
  the papers. And McIver particularly did not want that to happen. However, the
  next instant Sir Bryan soothed some of his worst fears.</p>

  <p>"Under no circumstances, Hugh," he remarked gravely, "is Algy to be given
  a chance of bursting any blood-vessel. You understand what I mean. What I
  have said to you this afternoon is for you alone&mdash;and no one else. We
  know it: Flash Jim and Co. know it."</p>

  <p>"And the jolly old masked sportsmen know it," said Hugh.</p>

  <p>"Quite," remarked Sir Bryan. "And that's a deuced sight too many already.
  We don't want any more."</p>

  <p>"As far as I am concerned, my brave Tumkins," cried the other, "the list
  is closed. Positively not another participator in the State secret. But I
  still don't see where I leap in and join the fray."</p>

  <p>"This way, old boy," said Sir Bryan. "McIver is a very strong man, and yet
  he was picked up last night as he himself says as if he was a baby, by one of
  these masked men who, judging from a note he wrote, is presumably the leader
  of the gang. And so we deduce that this leader is something exceptional in
  the way of strength."</p>

  <p>"By Gad! that's quick, Tumkins," said Hugh admiringly. "But then you
  always did have the devil of a brain."</p>

  <p>"Now you are something very exceptional in that line, Hugh," continued the
  other.</p>

  <p>"Oh! I can push a fellah's face if it's got spots and things," said Hugh
  deprecatingly.</p>

  <p>"And what I want to know is this. If we give you warning would you care to
  go with McIver the next time he has any job on, where he thinks it is likely
  this gang may turn up? We have a pretty shrewd idea as to the type of thing
  they specialise in."</p>

  <p>Hugh passed his hand dazedly over his forehead. "Sort of mother's help you
  mean," and McIver frowned horribly. "While the bird biffs McIver, I biff the
  bird. Is that the notion?"</p>

  <p>"That is the notion," agreed Sir Bryan. "Of course you'll have to do
  exactly what McIver tells you, and the whole thing is most unusual. But in
  view of the special features of the case...What is it, Miss Forbes?" He
  glanced up at his secretary, who was standing in the doorway, with a slight
  frown.</p>

  <p>"He insists on seeing you at once. Sir Bryan." She came forward with a
  card, which Sir Bryan took.</p>

  <p>"Charles Latter." The frown deepened. "What the deuce does he want?"</p>

  <p>The answer was supplied by the gentleman himself, who appeared at that
  moment in the doorway. He was evidently in a state of great agitation and Sir
  Bryan rose.</p>

  <p>"I am engaged at the moment, Mr. Latter," he said coldly.</p>

  <p>"My business won't take you a minute. Sir Bryan," he cried. "But what I
  want to know is this. Is this country civilised or is it not? Look at what I
  received by the afternoon post."</p>

  <p>He handed a sheet of paper to the other, who glanced at it casually. Then
  suddenly the casual look vanished, and Sir Bryan sat down at his desk, his
  eyes grim and stem. "By the afternoon post, you say."</p>

  <p>"Yes. And there have been too many disappearances lately!"</p>

  <p>"How did you know that?" snapped the chief, staring at him.</p>

  <p>For a moment Latter hesitated and changed colour. "Oh! everyone knows it,"
  he answered, trying to speak casually.</p>

  <p>"Everyone does not know it," remarked Sir Bryan quietly. "However, you did
  quite right to come to me. What are your plans during the next few days?"</p>

  <p>"I am going out of London to-morrow to stay with Lady Manton near
  Sheffield," answered Latter. "A semi-political house party. Good heavens!
  What's that?" With a snort Hugh sat up blinking.</p>

  <p>"So sorry, old lad," he burbled. "I snored: know I did. Late hours are the
  devil, aren't they?" He heaved himself out of his chair, and grinned
  pleasantly at Latter, who frowned disapprovingly.</p>

  <p>"I don't go in for them myself. Well, Sir Bryan."</p>

  <p>"This matter shall be attended to, Mr. Latter. I will see to it. Good
  afternoon. I will keep this note."</p>

  <p>"And who was that little funny-face?" said Hugh as the door closed behind
  Mr. Latter.</p>

  <p>"Member of Parliament for a north country constituency," answered Sir
  Bryan, still staring at the piece of paper in his hand. "Lives above his
  income. Keenly ambitious. But I thought he was all right."</p>

  <p>The other two stared at him in surprise. "What do you mean, sir?" asked
  McIver at length.</p>

  <p>"Our unknown friends do not think so, Mac," answered the chief, handing
  his subordinate the note left by Latter. "They are beginning to interest me,
  these gentlemen."</p>

  <p>"You need a rest, Charles Latter," read McIver slowly. "We have
  established a home for people like you where several of your friends await
  you. In a few days you will join them."</p>

  <p>"There are two things which strike one, McIver," remarked Sir Bryan
  thoughtfully, lighting cigarette. "First and most important: that message and
  the one you found this morning were written on the same typewriter&mdash;the
  letter 's' is distorted in each case. And, secondly, Mr. Charles Latter
  appears to have inside information concerning the recent activities of our
  masked friends which it is difficult to see how he came by. Unless "&mdash;he
  paused and stared out of the window with a slight frown&mdash;"unless they
  are far more conversant with his visiting list than I am."</p>

  <p>McIver's great jaw stuck out as if made of granite. "It proves my theory,
  sir," he grunted, "but if these jokers try that game on with Mr. Latter they
  won't catch me a second time."</p>

  <p>A terrific blow on the back made him gasp and splutter. "There speaks my
  hero&mdash;boy," cried Hugh. "Together we will outwit the knaves. I will
  write and cancel a visit: glad of the chance. Old Julia Manton&mdash;face
  like a horse: house at Sheffield: roped me in, Tumkins&mdash;positively
  stunned me with her verbosity. Ghastly house&mdash;but reeks of boodle."</p>

  <p>Sir Bryan looked at him surprised. "Do you mean to say you are going to
  Lady Manton's?"</p>

  <p>"I was. But not now. I will stick closer than a brother to Mr.
  McIver."</p>

  <p>"I think not, old man. You go. If you'd been awake you'd have heard Latter
  say that he was going there too. You can be of use sooner than I
  thought."</p>

  <p>"Latter going to old Julia?" Hugh stared at him amazed. "My dear old Tum-
  tum, what a perfectly amazing coincidence."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3">III. &mdash; IN WHICH HUGH DRUMMOND COMPOSES A
     LETTER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Hugh Drummond strolled slowly along Whitehall in the
  direction of Trafalgar Square. His face wore its habitual look of vacuous
  good humour, and at intervals he hummed a little tune under his breath. It
  was outside the Carlton that he paused as a car drew up by his side, and a
  man and a girl got out.</p>

  <p>"Algy, my dear old boy," he murmured, taking off his hat, "are we in good
  health to-day?"</p>

  <p>"Passable, old son," returned Algy Longworth, adjusting his quite
  unnecessary eye-glass. "The oysters wilted a bit this morning, but I'm trying
  again to-night. By the way, do you know Miss Farreydale?"</p>

  <p>Hugh bowed. "You know the risk you run, I suppose, going about with
  him?"</p>

  <p>The girl laughed. "He seems harmless," she answered lightly.</p>

  <p>"That's his guile. After a second cup of tea he's a perfect devil. By the
  same token, Algy, I am hibernating a while in the country. Going to dear old
  Julia Manton's for a few days. Up Sheffield way."</p>

  <p>Miss Farreydale looked at him with a puzzled frown. "Do you mean Lady
  Manton&mdash;Sir John's wife?"</p>

  <p>"That's the old dear," returned Hugh. "Know her?"</p>

  <p>"Fairly well. But her name isn't Julia. And she won't love you if you call
  her old."</p>

  <p>"Good heavens! Isn't it? And won't she? I must be mixing her up with
  someone else."</p>

  <p>"Dorothy Manton is a well-preserved woman of&mdash;shall we
  say&mdash;thirty-five? She was a grocer's daughter: she is now a snob of the
  worst type. I hope you'll enjoy yourself."</p>

  <p>"Your affection for her stuns me," murmured Hugh. "I appear to be in for a
  cheerful time."</p>

  <p>"When do you go, Hugh?" asked Algy.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow, old man. But I'm keeping you from your tea. Keep the table
  between you after the second cup, Miss Farreydale."</p>

  <p>He lifted his hat and walked on up the Haymarket, only to turn back
  suddenly.</p>

  <p>"'Daisy,' you said, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"No. Dorothy," laughed the girl. "Come on, Algy, I want my tea."</p>

  <p>She passed into the Carlton, and for a moment the two men were together on
  the pavement.</p>

  <p>"Lucky she knows the Manton woman," murmured Hugh.</p>

  <p>"Don't you?" gasped Algy.</p>

  <p>"Not from Eve, old son. Don't fix up anything in the near future. We shall
  be busy. I've joined the police and shall require help."</p>

  <p>With a cheery nod he strolled off, and after a moment's hesitation Algy
  Longworth followed the girl into the Carlton.</p>

  <p>"Mad, isn't he&mdash;your friend?" she remarked as he came up.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," he answered. "Let's masticate an eclair."</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour later Hugh let himself into his house in Brook
  Street. On the hall table were three telegrams which he opened and read.
  Then, having torn them into tiny fragments, he went on into his study and
  rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"Beer, Denny," he remarked, as his servant came in. "Beer in a mug. I am
  prostrate. And then bring me one of those confounded books which people have
  their names put in followed by the usual lies."</p>

  <p>"Who's Who, sir," said Denny.</p>

  <p>"You've got it," said his master. "Though who is who in these days, Denny,
  is a very dark matter. I am rapidly losing my faith in my brother
  man&mdash;rapidly. And then after that we have to write a letter to
  Julia&mdash;no, Dorothy Manton&mdash;erstwhile grocer's daughter with whom I
  propose to dally for a few days."</p>

  <p>"I don't seem to know the name, sir."</p>

  <p>"Nor did I, Denny, until about an hour ago. But I have it on reliable
  authority that she exists."</p>

  <p>"But how, sir..." began the bewildered Denny.</p>

  <p>"At the moment the way is dark," admitted Drummond. "The fog of war
  enwraps me. Beer, fool, beer."</p>

  <p>Accustomed to the little vagaries of his master, Denny left the room to
  return shortly with a large jug of beer which he placed on a small table
  beside Drummond's chair. Then he waited motionless behind his chair with a
  pencil and writing-block in his hand.</p>

  <p>"A snob, Denny; a snob," said Drummond at length, putting down his empty
  glass. "How does one best penetrate into the life and home of a female snob
  whom one does not even know by sight? Let us reason from first principles.
  What have we in our repertoire that would fling wide the portals of her
  house, revealing to our awestruck gaze all the footmen ranged in a row?" He
  rose suddenly. "I've got it, Denny; at least some of it. We have old Turnip-
  top. Is he not a cousin of mine?"</p>

  <p>"You mean Lord Stavely, sir," said Denny diffidently.</p>

  <p>"Of course I do, you ass. Who else?" Clasping his replenished glass of
  beer, Hugh strode up and down the room. "Somehow or other we must drag him
  in."</p>

  <p>"He's in Central Africa, sir," reminded Denny cautiously.</p>

  <p>"What the devil does that matter? Julia&mdash;I mean Dorothy&mdash;won't
  know. Probably never heard of the poor old thing. Write, fool; take your pen
  and write quickly.</p>

  <p>"'Dear Lady Manton,</p>

  <p>"'I hope you have not forgotten the pleasant few days we spent together at
  Wiltshire Towers this spring.'"</p>

  <p>"But you didn't go to the Duke's this spring, sir," gasped Denny.</p>

  <p>"I know that, you ass&mdash;but no more did she. To be exact, the place
  was being done up, only she won't know. Go on, I'm going to overflow
  again."</p>

  <p>"'I certainly have not forgotten the kind invitation you gave to my cousin
  Staveley and myself to come and stop with you. He, at the moment, is killing
  beasts in Africa: whereas I am condemned to this unpleasant country. To-
  morrow I have to go to Sheffield...'"</p>

  <p>He paused. "Why, Denny&mdash;why do I have to go to Sheffield? Why in
  Heaven's name does anyone ever go to Sheffield?"</p>

  <p>"They make knives there, sir."</p>

  <p>"Do they? But you needn't go there to buy them. And anyway, I don't want
  knives."</p>

  <p>"You might just say on business, sir," remarked his servant.</p>

  <p>"Gad! you're a genius, Denny. Put that in. 'Sheffield on business, and I
  wondered if I might take you at your word and come to...' Where's the bally
  woman live? Look it up in Who's Who."</p>

  <p>"Drayton House, sir," announced Denny.</p>

  <p>"'To Drayton House for a day or two. Yours very sincerely.' That'll do the
  trick, Denny. Give it to me, and I'll write it out. A piece of the best paper
  with the crest and telephone number embossed in blue, and the victory is
  ours."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you giving her rather short notice, sir?" said Denny
  doubtfully.</p>

  <p>Drummond laid down his pen and stared at him sadly.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes, Denny, I despair of you," he answered. "Even after four years
  of communion with me there are moments when you relapse into your pristine
  brain wallow. If I gave her any longer it is just conceivable&mdash;though I
  admit not likely&mdash;that I might get my answer from her stating that she
  was completely unaware of my existence, and that she'd sent my letter to the
  police. And where should we be then, my faithful varlet? As it is, I shall
  arrive at Drayton House just after the letter, discover with horror that I
  have made a mistake, and be gracefully forgiven by my charming hostess as
  befits a man with such exalted friends. Now run away and get me a taxi."</p>

  <p>"Will you be in to dinner, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps&mdash;perhaps not. In case I'm not, I shall go up to Sheffield in
  the Rolls to-morrow. See that everything is packed."</p>

  <p>"Will you want me to come with you, sir?"</p>

  <p>"No, Denny&mdash;not this time. I have a sort of premonition that I'm
  going to enjoy myself at Drayton House, and you're too young for that sort of
  thing."</p>

  <p>With a resigned look on his face, Denny left the room, closing the door
  gently behind him. But Drummond, left to himself, did not at once continue
  his letter to Lady Manton. With his pen held loosely in his hand he sat at
  his desk staring thoughtfully at the wall opposite. Gone completely was his
  customary inane look of good humour: in its place was an expression of quiet,
  almost grim, determination. He had the air of a man faced with big decisions,
  and to whom, moreover, such an experience was no novelty. For some five
  minutes he sat there motionless; then with a short laugh he came out of his
  reverie.</p>

  <p>"We're getting near the motto, my son," he muttered&mdash;"deuced near. If
  we don't draw the badger in a few weeks, I'll eat my hat."</p>

  <p>With another laugh he turned once more to his half-finished letter. And a
  minute or two later, having stamped and addressed the envelope, he slipped it
  into his pocket and rose. He crossed the room and unlocked a small safe which
  stood in the corner. From it he took a small automatic revolver which he
  dropped into his coat pocket, also a tiny bundle of what looked like fine
  black silk. Then, having relocked the safe he picked up his hat and stick and
  went into the hall.</p>

  <p>"Denny," he called, pausing by the front door.</p>

  <p>"Sir," answered that worthy, appearing from the back premises.</p>

  <p>"If Mr. Darrell or any of them ring up I shall be tearing a devilled bone
  to-night at the Savoy grill at eleven o'clock."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4">IV. &mdash; IN WHICH COUNT ZADOWA GETS A SHOCK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Number 5, Green Street, Hoxton, was not a prepossessing
  abode. A notice on one of the dingy downstair windows announced that Mr.
  William Atkinson was prepared to advance money on suitable security: a visit
  during business hours revealed that this was no more than the truth, even if
  the appearance of Mr. Atkinson's minion caused the prospective borrower to
  wonder how he had acquired such an aggressively English name.</p>

  <p>The second and third floors were apparently occupied by his staff, which
  seemed unduly large considering the locality and quality of his business.
  Hoxton is hardly in that part of London where large sums of money might be
  expected to change hands, and yet there was no doubt that Mr. William
  Atkinson's staff was both large and busy. So busy indeed were his clerks that
  frequently ten and eleven o'clock at night found them still working hard,
  though the actual business of the day downstairs concluded at six
  o'clock&mdash;eight Saturdays.</p>

  <p>It was just before closing time on the day after the strange affair down
  at Barking that a large, unkempt-looking individual presented himself at Mr.
  Atkinson's office. His most pressing need would have seemed to the casual
  observer to be soap and water, but his appearance apparently excited no
  surprise in the assistant downstairs. Possibly Hoxton is tolerant of such
  trifles.</p>

  <p>The clerk&mdash;a pale, anaemic-looking man with an unhealthy skin and a
  hook nose&mdash;rose wearily from his rest.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" he demanded morosely.</p>

  <p>"Wot d'yer think!" retorted the other. "Cat's meat?"</p>

  <p>The clerk recoiled, and the blood mounted angrily to his sallow face.
  "Don't you use that tone with me, my man," he said angrily. "I'd have you to
  know that this is my office."</p>

  <p>"Yus," answered the other. "Same as it's your nose sitting there like a
  lump o' putty stuck on to a suet pudding. And if I 'ave any o' your lip, I'll
  pull it off&mdash;see. Throw it outside, I will, and you after it&mdash;you
  parboiled lump of bad tripe. Nah, then&mdash;business." With a blow that
  shook the office he thumped the desk with a huge fist. "I ain't got no time
  to waste&mdash;even if you 'ave. 'Ow much?" He threw a pair of thick hob-
  nailed boots on to the counter, and stood glaring at the other.</p>

  <p>"Two bob," said the clerk indifferently, throwing down a coin and picking
  up the boots.</p>

  <p>"Two bob!" cried the other wrathfully. "Two bob, you miserable Sheenie."
  For a moment or two he spluttered inarticulately as if speech was beyond him;
  then his huge hand shot out and gripped the clerk by the collar. "Think
  again, Archibald," he continued quietly, "think again and think better."</p>

  <p>But the assistant, as might be expected in one of his calling, was
  prepared for emergencies of this sort. Very gently his right hand slid along
  the counter towards a concealed electric bell which communicated with the
  staff upstairs. It fulfilled several purposes, that bell: it acted as a call
  for help or as a warning, and according to the number of times it was
  pressed, the urgency of the matter could be interpreted by those who heard
  it. Just now the clerk decided that two rings would meet the case: he
  disliked the appearance of the large and angry man in whose grip he felt
  absolutely powerless, and he felt he would like help&mdash;very urgently. And
  so it was perhaps a little unfortunate for him that he should have allowed an
  ugly little smirk to adorn his lips a second or two before his hand found the
  bell. The man facing him across the counter saw that smirk and lost his
  temper in earnest. With a grunt of rage he hit the other square between the
  eyes, and the clerk collapsed in a huddled heap behind the counter with the
  bell still unrung.</p>

  <p>For a few moments the big man stood motionless, listening intently. From
  upstairs came the faint tapping of a typewriter; from outside the usual
  street noises of London came softly through the two closed doors. Then, with
  an agility remarkable in one so big, he vaulted the counter and inspected the
  recumbent assistant with a professional eye. A faint grin spread over his
  face as he noted that gentleman's condition, but after that he wasted no
  time. So quickly and methodically in fact did he set about things, that it
  seemed as if the whole performance must have been cut and dried beforehand,
  even to the temporary indisposition of the clerk. In half a minute he was
  bound and gagged and deposited under the counter. Beside him the big man
  placed the pair of boots, attached to which was a piece of paper which he
  took from his pocket. On it was scrawled in an illiterate hand&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Have took a fare price for the boots, yer swine." Then quite deliberately
  the big man forced the till and removed some money, after which he once more
  examined the unconscious man under the counter.</p>

  <p>"Without a hitch," he muttered. "Absolutely according to Cocker. Now, old
  lad of the village, we come to the second item on the programme. That must be
  the door I want."</p>

  <p>He opened it cautiously, and the subdued hum of voices from above came a
  little louder to his ears. Then like a shadow he vanished into the semi-
  darkness of the house upstairs.</p>

  <p>It was undoubtedly a house of surprises, was Number 5, Green Street. A
  stranger passing through the dingy office on the ground floor where Mr.
  Atkinson's assistant was wont to sit at the receipt of custom, and then
  ascending the stairs to the first story would have found it hard to believe
  that he was in the same house. But then, strangers were not encouraged to do
  anything of the sort.</p>

  <p>There was a door at the top of the flight of stairs, and it was at this
  door that the metamorphosis took place. On one side of it the stairs ran
  carpetless and none too clean to the ground floor, on the other side the
  picture changed. A wide passage with rooms leading out of it from either side
  confronted the explorer&mdash;a passage which was efficiently illuminated
  with electric lights hung from the ceiling, and the floor of which was
  covered with a good plain carpet. Along the walls ran rows of bookshelves
  stretching, save for the gaps at the doors, as far as a partition which
  closed the further end of the passage. In this partition was another door,
  and beyond this second door the passage continued to a window tightly
  shuttered and bolted. From this continuation only one room led off&mdash;a
  room which would have made the explorer rub his eyes in surprise. It was
  richly, almost luxuriously, furnished. In the centre stood a big roll-top
  writing-desk, while scattered about were several arm-chairs upholstered in
  green leather. A long table almost filled one side of the room; a table
  covered with every imaginable newspaper. A huge safe flush with the wall
  occupied the other side, while the window, like the one outside, was almost
  hermetically sealed. There was a fireplace in the corner, but there was no
  sign of any fire having been lit, or of any preparations for lighting one.
  Two electric heaters attached by long lengths of flex to plugs in the wall
  comprised the heating arrangements, while a big central light and half a
  dozen movable ones illuminated every corner of the room.</p>

  <p>In blissful ignorance of the sad plight of the clerk below, two men were
  sitting in this room, deep in conversation. In a chair drawn up close to the
  desk was no less a person than Charles Latter, M.P., and it was he who was
  doing most of the talking. But it was the other man who riveted attention:
  the man who presumably was Mr. Atkinson himself. He was seated in a swivel
  chair which he had slewed round so as to face the speaker, and it was his
  appearance which caught the eye and then held it fascinated.</p>

  <p>At first he seemed to be afflicted with an almost phenomenal stoop, and it
  was only when one got nearer that the reason was clear. The man was a
  hunchback, and the effect it gave was that of a huge bird of prey. Unlike
  most hunchbacks, his legs were of normal length, and as he sat motionless in
  his chair, a hand on each knee, staring with unwinking eyes at his talkative
  companion, there was something menacing and implacable in his appearance. His
  hair was grey; his features stern and hard; while his mouth reminded one of a
  steel trap. But it was his eyes that dominated everything&mdash;grey-blue and
  piercing, they seemed able to probe one's innermost soul. A man to whom it
  would be unwise to lie&mdash;a man utterly unscrupulous in himself, who would
  yet punish double dealing in those who worked for him with merciless
  severity. A dangerous man.</p>

  <p>"So you went to the police, Mr. Latter," he remarked suavely. "And what
  had our friend Sir Bryan Johnstone to say on the matter?"</p>

  <p>"At first, Count, he didn't say much. In fact he really said very little
  all through. But once he looked at the note his whole manner changed. I could
  see that instantly. There was something about the note which interested
  him...."</p>

  <p>"Let me see it," said the Count, holding out his hand.</p>

  <p>"I left it with Sir Bryan," answered the other. "He asked me to let him
  keep it. And he promised that I should be all right."</p>

  <p>The Count's lips curled.</p>

  <p>"It would take more than Sir Bryan Johnstone's promise, Mr. Latter, to
  ensure your safety. Do you know whom that note was from?"</p>

  <p>"I thought, Count," said the other a little tremulously&mdash;"I thought
  it might be from this mysterious Black Gang that one has heard rumours
  about."</p>

  <p>"It was," replied the Count tersely.</p>

  <p>"Heavens!" stammered Latter. "Then it's true; they exist."</p>

  <p>"In the last month," answered the hunchback, staring fixedly at his
  frightened companion, "nearly twenty of our most useful men have disappeared.
  They have simply vanished into thin air. I know, no matter how, that it is
  not the police: the police are as mystified as we are. But the police, Mr.
  Latter, whatever views they may take officially, are in all probability
  unofficially very glad of our friends' disappearance. At any rate until last
  night."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked the other.</p>

  <p>"Last night the police were baulked of their prey, and McIver doesn't like
  being baulked. You know Zaboleff was sent over?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course. That is one of the reasons I came round tonight. Have you
  seen him?"</p>

  <p>"I have not," answered the Count grimly. "The police found out he was
  coming."</p>

  <p>Mr. Latter's face blanched: the thought of Zaboleff in custody didn't
  appeal to him. It may be mentioned that his feelings were purely
  selfish&mdash;Zaboleff knew too much.</p>

  <p>But the Count was speaking again. A faint sneer was on his face; he had
  read the other's mind like an open book.</p>

  <p>"And so," he continued, "did the Black Gang. They removed Zaboleff and our
  friend Waldock from under the very noses of the police, and, like the twenty
  others, they have disappeared."</p>

  <p>"My God!" There was no doubt now about Mr. Latter's state of mind. "And
  now they've threatened me."</p>

  <p>"And now they've threatened you," agreed the Count. "And you, I am glad to
  say, have done exactly what I should have told you to do, had I seen you
  sooner. You have gone to the police."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but," stammered Latter, "the police were no good to Zaboleff
  last night."</p>

  <p>"And it is quite possible," returned the other calmly, "that they will be
  equally futile in your case. Candidly, Mr. Latter, I am completely
  indifferent on the subject of your future. You have served our purpose, and
  all that matters is that you happen to be the bone over which the dogs are
  going to fight. Until last night the dogs hadn't met&mdash;officially; and in
  the rencontre last night, the police dog, unless I'm greatly mistaken, was
  caught by surprise. McIver doesn't let that happen twice. In your case he'll
  be ready. With luck this cursed Black Gang, who are infinitely more nuisance
  to me than the police have been or ever will be, will get bitten badly."</p>

  <p>Mr. Latter was breathing heavily.</p>

  <p>"But what do you want me to do, Count?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all, except what you were going to do normally," answered the
  other. He glanced at a notebook on his desk. "You were going to Lady Manton's
  near Sheffield, I see. Don't alter your plans&mdash;go. In all probability it
  will take place at her house." He glanced contemptuously at the other's
  somewhat green face, and his manner changed abruptly. "You understand, Mr.
  Latter," his voice was deadly smooth and quiet, "you understand, don't you,
  what I say? You will go to Lady Manton's house as arranged, and you will
  carry on exactly as if you had never received this note. Because if you
  don't, if you attempt any tricks with me, whatever the Black Gang may do or
  may not do to you, however much the police may protect you or may not protect
  you&mdash;you will have us to reckon with. And you know what that means."</p>

  <p>"Supposing the gang gets me and foils the police," muttered Latter through
  dry lips. "What then?"</p>

  <p>"I shall deal with them personally. They annoy me."</p>

  <p>There was something so supremely confident in the tone of the Count's
  voice, that the other man looked at him quickly.</p>

  <p>"But have you any idea who they are?" he asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"None&mdash;at present. Their leader is clever&mdash;but so am I. They
  have deliberately elected to fight me, and now I have had enough. It will
  save trouble if the police catch them for me: but if not..."</p>

  <p>The Count shrugged his shoulders, and with a gesture of his hand dismissed
  the matter. Then he picked up a piece of paper from the desk and glanced at
  it.</p>

  <p>"I will now give you your orders for Sheffield," he continued. "It has
  been reported to me that in Sir John Manton's works there is a red-hot madman
  named Delmorlick. He has a good job himself, but he spends most of his spare
  time inciting the unemployed&mdash;of which I am glad to say there are large
  numbers in the town&mdash;to absurd deeds of violence. He is a very valuable
  man to us, and appears to be one of those extraordinary beings who really
  believe in the doctrines of Communism. He can lash a mob, they tell me, into
  an absolute frenzy with his tongue. I want you to seek him out, and give him
  fifty pounds to carry on with. Tell him, of course, that it comes from the
  Great Master in Russia, and spur him on to renewed activity.</p>

  <p>"You will also employ him, and two or three others whom you must leave him
  to choose, to carry out a little scheme of which you will find full details
  in this letter." He handed an envelope to Latter, who took it with a
  trembling hand. "You personally will make arrangements about the necessary
  explosives. I calculate that, if successful, it should throw at least three
  thousand more men out of work. Moreover, Mr. Latter, if it is successful your
  fee will be a thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"A thousand!" muttered Latter. "Is there much danger?"</p>

  <p>The Count smiled contemptuously. "Not if you do your work properly. Hullo!
  What's up?"</p>

  <p>From a little electric bell at his elbow came four shrill rings, repeated
  again and again.</p>

  <p>The Count rose and with systematic thoroughness swept every piece of paper
  off the desk into his pocket. Then he shut down the top and locked it, while
  the bell, a little muffled, still rang inside.</p>

  <p>"What's the fool doing?" he cried angrily, stepping over to the big safe
  let into the wall, while Latter, his face white and terrified, followed at
  his side. And then abruptly the bell stopped.</p>

  <p>Very deliberately the Count pressed two concealed knobs, so sunk into the
  wall as to be invisible to a stranger, and the door of the safe swung open.
  And only then was it obvious that the safe was not a safe, but a second exit
  leading to a flight of stairs. For a moment or two he stood motionless,
  listening intently, while Latter fidgeted at his side. One hand was on a
  master switch which controlled all the lights, the other on a knob inside the
  second passage which, when turned, would close the great steel door
  noiselessly behind them.</p>

  <p>He was frowning angrily, but gradually the frown was replaced by a look of
  puzzled surprise. Four rings from the shop below was the recognised signal
  for urgent danger, and everybody's plan of action was cut and dried for such
  an emergency. In the other rooms every book and paper in the slightest degree
  incriminating was hurled pell-mell into secret recesses in the floor which
  had been specially constructed under every table. In their place appeared
  books carefully and very skillfully faked, purporting to record the business
  transactions of Mr. William Atkinson. And in the event of surprise being
  expressed at the size of Mr. Atkinson's business considering the sort of
  office he possessed below, and the type of his clientele, it would soon be
  seen that Hoxton was but one of several irons which that versatile gentleman
  had in the fire. There were indisputable proofs in indisputable ledgers that
  Mr. Atkinson had organised similar enterprises in several of the big towns of
  England and Scotland, to say nothing of a large West End branch run under the
  name of Lewer Brothers. And surely he had the perfect right, if he so wished,
  to establish his central office in Hoxton...Or Timbuctoo...What the devil did
  it matter to anyone except himself?</p>

  <p>In the big room at the end the procedure was even simpler. The Count
  merely passed through the safe door and vanished through his private bolt-
  hole, leaving everything in darkness. And should inconvenient visitors ask
  inconvenient questions&mdash;well, it was Mr. Atkinson's private office, and
  a very nice office too, though at the moment he was away.</p>

  <p>Thus the procedure&mdash;simple and sound; but on this occasion something
  seemed to have gone wrong. Instead of the industrious silence of clerks
  working overtime on affairs of financial import in Edinburgh and Manchester,
  a perfect babel of voices became audible in the passage. And then there came
  an agitated knocking on the door.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" cried the Count sharply. It may be mentioned that even the
  most influential members of his staff knew better than to come into the room
  without previously obtaining permission.</p>

  <p>"It's me, sir&mdash;Cohen," came an agitated voice from outside.</p>

  <p>For a moment the Count paused: then with a turn of the knob he closed the
  safe door silently. With an imperious hand he waved Latter to a chair, and
  resumed his former position at the desk.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he snapped.</p>

  <p>It was a strange and unwholesome object that obeyed the order, and the
  Count sat back in his chair.</p>

  <p>"What the devil have you been doing?"</p>

  <p>A pair of rich blue-black eyes, and a nose from which traces of blood
  still trickled had not improved the general appearance of the assistant
  downstairs. In one hand he carried a pair of hobnail boots, in the other a
  piece of paper, and he brandished them alternately while a flood of
  incoherent frenzy burst from his lips.</p>

  <p>For a minute or two the Count listened, until his first look of surprise
  gave way to one of black anger.</p>

  <p>"Am I to understand, you wretched little worm," he snarled, "that you gave
  the urgency danger signal, not once but half a dozen times, merely because a
  man hit you over the nose?"</p>

  <p>"But he knocked me silly, sir," quavered the other. "And when I came to,
  and saw the boots lying beside me and the till opened, I kind of lost my
  head. I didn't know what had happened, sir&mdash;and I thought I'd better
  ring the bell&mdash;in case of trouble."</p>

  <p>He retreated a step or two towards the door, terrified out of his wits by
  the look of diabolical fury in the hunchback's eyes. Three or four clerks,
  who had been surreptitiously peeping through the open door, melted rapidly
  away, while from his chair Mr. Latter watched the scene fascinated. He was
  reminded of a bird and a snake, and suddenly he gave a little shudder as he
  realised that his own position was in reality much the same as that of the
  unfortunate Cohen.</p>

  <p>And then just as the tension was becoming unbearable there came the
  interruption. Outside in the passage, clear and distinct, there sounded twice
  the hoot of an owl. To Mr. Latter it meant nothing; to the frightened little
  Jew it meant nothing; but on the Count the effect was electrical. With a
  quickness incredible in one so deformed he was at the door, and into the
  passage, hurling Cohen out of his way into a corner. His powerful fists were
  clenched by his side: the veins in his neck were standing out like whipcord.
  But to Mr. Latter's surprise he made no movement, and rising from his chair
  he too peered round the door along the passage, only to stagger back after a
  second or two with a feeling of sick fear in his soul, and a sudden dryness
  in the throat. For twenty yards away, framed in the doorway at the head of
  the stairs leading down to the office below, he had seen a huge, motionless
  figure. For a perceptible time he had stared at it, and it had seemed to
  stare at him. Then the door had shut, and on the other side a key had turned.
  And the figure had been draped from head to foot in black....</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap5"
     name="chap5">V. &mdash; IN WHICH CHARLES LATTER, M.P., GOES MAD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Drummond arrived at Drayton House just as the house-party
  was sitting down to tea in the hall. A rapid survey of the guests as the
  footman helped him out of his coat&mdash;convinced him that, with the
  exception of Latter, he didn't know a soul: a second glance indicated that he
  could contemplate the fact with equanimity. They were a stodgy-looking crowd,
  and after a brief look he turned his attention to his hostess.</p>

  <p>"Where is Lady Manton?" he asked the footman. "Pouring out tea, sir,"
  returned the man surprised. "Great Scott!" said Drummond, aghast. "I've come
  to the wrong house."</p>

  <p>"The wrong house, sir?" echoed the footman, and the sound of their voices
  made Lady Manton look up.</p>

  <p>In an instant that astute woman spotted what had happened. The writer of
  the strange letter she had received at lunch-time had arrived, and had
  realised his mistake. Moreover, this was the moment for which she had been
  waiting ever since, and now to add joy to joy it had occurred when her whole
  party was assembled to hear every word of her conversation with Drummond.
  With suitable gratitude she realised that such opportunities are rare.</p>

  <p>With a charming smile she advanced towards him, as he stood hesitating by
  the door. "Mr. Drummond?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he murmured, with a puzzled frown. "But&mdash;but I seem to have
  made some absurd mistake."</p>

  <p>She laughed, and drew him into the hall. "A perfectly natural one, I
  assure you," she replied, speaking so that her guests could hear. "It must
  have been my sister-in-law that you met at Wiltshire Towers. My husband was
  not very fit at the time and so I had to refuse the Duchess's invitation."
  She was handing him a cup of tea as she spoke. "But, of course, I know your
  cousin. Lord Staveley, well. So we really know one another after all, don't
  we?"</p>

  <p>"Charming of you to put it that way, Lady Manton," answered Drummond, with
  his infectious grin. "At the same time I feel a bit of an
  interloper&mdash;what! Sort of case of fools toddling in where angels fear to
  tread."</p>

  <p>"A somewhat infelicitous quotation," remarked an unctuous-looking man with
  side whiskers, deprecatingly.</p>

  <p>"Catches you too, does it, old bird?" boomed Hugh, putting down his empty
  cup.</p>

  <p>"It was the second part of your quotation that I was alluding to,"
  returned the other acidly, when Lady Manton intervened.</p>

  <p>"Of course, Mr. Drummond, my husband and I insist on your remaining with
  us until you have completed your business in Sheffield."</p>

  <p>"Extraordinarily kind of you both, Lady Manton," answered Hugh.</p>

  <p>"How long do you think you will be?"</p>

  <p>"Three or four days. Perhaps a little more." As he spoke he looked quite
  casually at Latter. For some minutes that worthy pillar of Parliament had
  been staring at him with a puzzled frown: now he gave a slight start as
  recognition came to him. This was the enormous individual who had snored in
  Sir Bryan Johnstone's office the previous afternoon. Evidently somebody
  connected with the police, reflected Mr. Latter, and glancing at Drummond's
  vast size he began to feel more reassured than he had for some time. A
  comforting sort of individual to have about the premises in the event of a
  brawl: good man&mdash;Sir Bryan. This man looked large enough to cope even
  with that monstrous black apparition, the thought of which still brought a
  shudder to his spine.</p>

  <p>Drummond was still looking at him, but there was no trace of recognition
  in his eyes. Evidently they were to meet as strangers before the house-
  party: quite right too, when some of the guests themselves might even be
  members of this vile gang.</p>

  <p>"It depends on circumstances outside my control," Drummond was saying.
  "But if you can do with me for a few days..."</p>

  <p>"As long as you like, Mr. Drummond," answered Lady Manton. "And now let me
  introduce you to my guests."</p>

  <p>It was not until just before dinner that Mr. Latter had an opportunity of
  a few private words with Drummond. They met in the hall, and for the moment
  no one else was within earshot.</p>

  <p>"You were in Sir Bryan Johnstone's office yesterday," said the M.P.
  hoarsely. "Are you connected with the police?"</p>

  <p>"Intimately," answered Hugh. "Even now, Mr. Latter, you are completely
  surrounded by devoted men who are watching and guarding you."</p>

  <p>A gratified smile spread over the other's face, though Drummond's remained
  absolutely expressionless.</p>

  <p>"And how did you get here, Mr. Drummond?"</p>

  <p>"By car," returned Hugh gravely.</p>

  <p>"I mean into the house-party," said Mr. Latter stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Hugh looked mysterious. "That is between you and me, Mr.
  Latter."</p>

  <p>"Quite: quite. I am discretion itself."</p>

  <p>"Until two hours ago I thought I was the biggest liar in the world: now I
  know I'm not. Our hostess has me beat to a frazzle."</p>

  <p>"What on earth are you talking about?" cried Latter, amazed.</p>

  <p>"There are wheels within wheels, Mr. Latter," continued Hugh still more
  mysteriously. "A network of intrigue surrounds us. But do not be afraid. My
  orders are never to leave your side."</p>

  <p>"Good God, Mr. Drummond, do you mean to say...?"</p>

  <p>"I mean to say nothing. Only this one thing I will mention." He laid an
  impressive hand on Latter's arm. "Be very careful what you say to that man
  with the mutton-chop whiskers and the face like a sheep."</p>

  <p>And the startled M.P. was too occupied staring suspiciously at the worthy
  Sheffield magnate and pillar of nonconformity who had just descended the
  stairs with his hostess to notice a sudden peculiar shaking in Drummond's
  shoulders as he turned away.</p>

  <p>Mr. Charles Latter was not a pleasant specimen of humanity even at the
  best of times, and that evening he was not at his best. He was frightened to
  the core of his rotten little soul, and when a constitutional coward is
  frightened the result is not pretty. His conversational efforts at dinner
  would have shamed a boy of ten, and though he made one or two feeble efforts
  to pull himself together, it was no good. Try as he would his mind kept
  reverting to his own position. Over and over again he went on weighing up the
  points of the case until his brain was whirling. He tried to make out a
  mental balance sheet where the stock was represented by his own personal
  safety, but there was always that one unknown factor which he came up
  against&mdash;the real power of this mysterious gang.</p>

  <p>Coming up in the train he had decided to curtail his visit as much as
  possible. He would carry through what he had been told to do, and then,
  having pocketed his thousand, he would leave the country for a few months. By
  that time the police should have settled matters. And he had been very lucky.
  It had proved easy to find the man Delmorlick, and once he had been found,
  the other more serious matter had proved easy too. Delmorlick had arranged
  everything, and had brought three other men to meet him in a private room at
  one of the smaller hotels.</p>

  <p>Like all the Count's schemes, every detail was perfect, and once or twice
  exclamations of amazement interrupted him as he read on. Every possible
  eventuality was legislated for, and by the time he had finished reading
  Delmorlick's eyes were glowing with the enthusiasm of a fanatic.</p>

  <p>"Magnificent," he had cried, rising and going to the window. "Another nail
  in the coffin of Capital. And, by heaven! a big one."</p>

  <p>He had stood there, his head covered with a shock of untidy hair, staring
  with sombre eyes at the street below. And beside him had stood one of the
  other men. After a while Latter joined them, and he too for a moment had
  looked down into the street where little knots of men lounged round doorways
  with their hands in their pockets, and the apathy of despair on their faces.
  A few women here and there mingled with them, but there was no laughing or
  jesting&mdash;only the sullenness of lost hope. The hope that had once been
  theirs of work and plenty was dead; there was nothing for them to
  do&mdash;they were just units in the vast army of unemployed. Occasionally a
  man better dressed and more prosperous than the others would detach himself
  from one group and go to another, where he would hold forth long and
  earnestly. And his listeners would nod their heads vigorously or laugh
  sheepishly as he passed on.</p>

  <p>For a few moments Delmorlick had watched in silence. Then with a grave
  earnestness in his voice he had turned to Latter.</p>

  <p>"We shall win, Mr. Latter, I tell you. That," with a lean forefinger he
  pointed to the man outside, "is going on all over England, Scotland and
  Ireland. And the fools in London prate of economic laws and inflated
  currencies. What does an abstract cause matter to those men; they want
  food."</p>

  <p>He had glanced at Delmorlick, to find the eyes of the other man fixed on
  him gravely. He had hardly noticed it at the time&mdash;he had been too
  anxious to get away; now, as he sat at dinner, he found strangely enough that
  it was the other man's face which seemed to have made the biggest impression
  on his mind. A new arrival in the place, so Delmorlick had told him&mdash;but
  red-hot for the cause of freedom and anarchy.</p>

  <p>He made some vague remark to his neighbour and once more relapsed into
  moody silence. So far, so good; his job was done&mdash;he could leave to-
  morrow. He would have left that afternoon but for the fact that he had sent
  his baggage up to Drayton House, and it would have looked strange. But he had
  already arranged for a wire to be sent to him from London the following
  morning, and for the night&mdash;well, there were Drummond and the police.
  Decidedly, on points he appeared to be in a winning position&mdash;quite a
  comfortable position. And yet&mdash;that unknown factor...Still, there was
  always Drummond; the only trouble was that he couldn't quite place him. What
  on earth had he meant before dinner? He glanced across the table at him now:
  he was eating salted almonds and making love to his hostess.</p>

  <p>"A fool," reflected Mr. Latter, "but a powerful fool. If it was necessary,
  he'd swallow anything I told him."</p>

  <p>And so, towards the end of dinner, aided possibly by his host's very
  excellent vintage port, Mr. Charles Latter had more or less soothed his
  fears. Surely he was safe in the house, and nothing would induce him to leave
  it until he went to the station next morning. No thought of the abominable
  crime he had planned only that afternoon disturbed his equanimity; as has
  been said, he was not a pleasant specimen of humanity.</p>

  <p>Charles Latter was unmoral rather than immoral: he was a constitutional
  coward with a strong liking for underhand intrigue, and he was utterly and
  entirely selfish. In his way he was ambitious: he wanted power, but, though
  in many respects he was distinctly able, he lacked that essential
  factor&mdash;the ability to work for it. He hated work: he wanted easy
  results. And to obtain lasting results is not easy, as Mr. Latter gradually
  discovered. A capability for making flashy speeches covered with a veneer of
  cleverness is an undoubted asset, but it is an asset the value of which has
  been gauged to a nicety by the men who count. And so as time went on, and the
  epoch-making day when he had been returned to Parliament faded into the past,
  Mr. Latter realised himself for what he was&mdash;a thing of no account. And
  the realisation was as gall and wormwood to his soul. It is a realisation
  which comes to many men, and it takes them different ways. Some become
  resigned&mdash;some make new and even more futile efforts: some see the
  humour of it, and some don't. Mr. Latter didn't: he became spiteful. And a
  spiteful coward is a nasty thing.</p>

  <p>It was just about that time that he met Count Zadowa. It was at dinner at
  a friend's house, and after the ladies had left he found himself sitting next
  to the hunchback with the strange, piercing eyes. He wasn't conscious of
  having said very much: he would have been amazed had he been told that within
  ten minutes this charming foreigner had read his unpleasant little mind like
  a book, and had reached a certain and quite definite decision. In fact,
  looking back on the past few months, Mr. Latter was at a loss to account as
  to how things had reached their present pass. Had he been told when he stood
  for Parliament, flaunting all the old hackneyed formula, that within two
  years he would be secretly engaged in red-hot Communist work, he would have
  laughed the idea to scorn. Anarchy, too: a nasty word, but the only one that
  fitted the bomb outrage in Manchester, which he had himself organised.
  Sometimes in the night, he used to wake and lie sweating as he thought of
  that episode....</p>

  <p>And gradually it had become worse and worse. Little by little the charming
  Count Zadowa, realising that Mr. Latter possessed just those gifts which he
  could utilise to advantage, had ceased to be charming. There were many
  advantages in having a Member of Parliament as chief liaison officer.</p>

  <p>There had been that first small slip when he signed a receipt for money
  paid him to address a revolutionary meeting in South Wales during the coal
  strike. And the receipt specified the service rendered. An unpleasant
  document in view of the fact that his principal supporters in his
  constituency were coal-owners. And after that the descent had been rapid.</p>

  <p>Not that even now Mr. Latter felt any twinges of conscience: all he felt
  was occasional twinges of fear that he might be found out. He was running
  with the hare and hunting with the hounds with a vengeance, and at times his
  cowardly little soul grew sick within him. And then, like a dreaded bolt from
  the blue, had come the letter of warning from the Black Gang.</p>

  <p>Anyway, he reflected, as he turned out his light after getting into bed
  that night, the police knew nothing of his double life. They were all round
  him, and there was this big fool in the house...For a moment his heart
  stopped beating: was it his imagination or was that the figure of a man
  standing at the foot of the bed?</p>

  <p>The sweat poured off his forehead as he tried to speak: then he sat up in
  bed, plucking with trembling hands at the collar of his pyjamas. Still the
  shape stood motionless: he could swear there was something there now&mdash;he
  could see it outlined against the dim light of the window. He reached out
  fearfully for the switch: fumbled a little, and then with a click the light
  went on. His sudden scream of fear died half-strangled in his throat: a livid
  anger took the place of terror. Leaning over the foot of the bed and
  regarding him with solicitous interest, lounged Hugh Drummond.</p>

  <p>"All tucked up and comfy, old bean," cried Drummond cheerfully. "Bed socks
  full of feet and all that sort of thing?"</p>

  <p>"How dare you," spluttered Latter, "how dare you come into my room like
  this...."</p>

  <p>"Tush, tush," murmured Drummond, "don't forget my orders, old Latter, my
  lad. To watch over you as a crooning mother crooneth over the last batch of
  twins. By the way, my boy, you skimped your teeth pretty badly to-night.
  You'll have to do better to-morrow. Most of your molars must be sitting up
  and begging for Kolynos if that's your normal effort."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me that you were in here while I was undressing?"
  said Latter angrily. "You exceed your instructions, sir: and I shall report
  your unwarrantable impertinence to Sir Bryan Johnstone when I return to
  London."</p>

  <p>"Exactly, Mr. Latter. But when will you return to London?" Drummond
  regarded him dispassionately. "To put some, if not all, of the cards on the
  table, the anonymous letter of warning which you received was not quite so
  anonymous as you would have liked. In other words, you know exactly whom it
  came from."</p>

  <p>"I don't," replied the other. "I know that it came from an abominable gang
  who have been committing a series of outrages lately. And that is why I
  applied for police protection."</p>

  <p>"Quite so, Mr. Latter. And as&mdash;er&mdash;Fate would have it, I am here
  to help carry out that role."</p>

  <p>"What did you mean when you gave me that warning before dinner? That man
  is one of the leading citizens of Sheffield."</p>

  <p>"That was just a little jest, Mr. Latter, to amuse you during the evening.
  The danger does not lie there."</p>

  <p>"Where does it lie?"</p>

  <p>"Probably where you least expect it," returned Drummond with an enigmatic
  smile.</p>

  <p>"I shall be going to-morrow," said Latter with attempted nonchalance.
  "Until then I rely on you."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," murmured Drummond. "So you have completed your business here
  quicker than you anticipated."</p>

  <p>"Yes. To be exact, this afternoon before you arrived."</p>

  <p>"And was that the business which brought you to Sheffield?"</p>

  <p>"Principally. Though I really don't understand this catechism, Mr.
  Drummond. And now I wish to go to sleep...."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you can't, Mr. Latter. Not quite yet." For a moment or two
  Charles Latter stared at the imperturbable face at the foot of his bed: it
  seemed to him that a strange tension was creeping into the
  conversation&mdash;a something he could not place which made him vaguely
  alarmed.</p>

  <p>"Do you think this mysterious Black Gang would approve of your business
  this afternoon?" asked Drummond quietly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Latter started violently.</p>

  <p>"How should I know of what the scoundrels would approve?" he cried
  angrily. "And anyway, they can know nothing about it."</p>

  <p>"You feel quite confident in Mr. Delmorlick's discretion with regard to
  the friends he selects?"</p>

  <p>And now a pulse was beginning to hammer in Mr. Latter's throat, and his
  voice when he spoke was thick and unnatural.</p>

  <p>"How do you know anything about Delmorlick?"</p>

  <p>Drummond smiled. "May I reply by asking a similar question, Mr. Latter?
  How do you?"</p>

  <p>"I met him this afternoon on political business," stammered the other,
  staring fascinated at the man opposite, from whose face all trace of
  buffoonery seemed to have vanished, to be replaced by a grim sternness the
  more terrifying because it was so utterly unexpected. And he had thought
  Drummond a fool....</p>

  <p>"Would it be indiscreet to inquire the nature of the business?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," muttered Latter. "It was private."</p>

  <p>"That I can quite imagine," returned Drummond grimly. "But since you're so
  reticent I will tell you. This afternoon you made arrangements, perfect in
  every detail, to blow up the main power station of the Greystone works." The
  man in the bed started violently. "The result of that would have been to
  throw some three thousand men out of work for at least a couple of
  months."</p>

  <p>"It's a lie," said Latter thickly.</p>

  <p>"Your object in so doing was obvious," continued Drummond. "Money. I don't
  know how much, and I didn't know who from&mdash;until last night." And now
  Latter was swallowing hard, and clutching the bedclothes with hands that
  shook like leaves.</p>

  <p>"You saw me last night, Mr. Latter, didn't you? And I found out your
  headquarters...."</p>

  <p>"In God's name&mdash;who are you?" His voice rose almost to a scream.
  "Aren't you the police?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I am not." He was coming nearer, and Latter cowered back,
  mouthing. "I am not the police, you wretched thing: I am the leader of the
  Black Gang."</p>

  <p>Latter felt the other's huge hands on him, and struggled like a puny
  child, whimpering, half sobbing. He writhed and squirmed as a gag was forced
  into his mouth: then he felt a rope cut his wrists as they were lashed behind
  his back. And all the while the other went on speaking in a calm, leisurely
  voice.</p>

  <p>"The leader of the Black Gang, Mr. Latter: the gang that came into
  existence to exterminate things like you. Ever since the war you poisonous
  reptiles have been at work stirring up internal trouble in this country. Not
  one in ten of you believe what you preach: your driving force is money and
  your own advancement. And as for your miserable dupes&mdash;those priceless
  fellows who follow you blindly because&mdash;God help them, they're hungry
  and their wives are hungry&mdash;what do you care for them, Mr. Latter? You
  just laugh in your sleeve and pocket the cash."</p>

  <p>With a heave he jerked the other on to the floor, and proceeded to lash
  him to the foot of the bed.</p>

  <p>"I have had my eye on you, Mr. Latter, since the Manchester effort when
  ten men were killed, and you were the murderer. But other and more important
  matters have occupied my time. You see, my information is very good&mdash;
  better than Delmorlick's selection of friends. The new devoted adherent to
  your cause this afternoon happens to be an intimate, personal friend of
  mine."</p>

  <p>He was busying himself with something that he had taken from his
  pocket&mdash;a thick, square slab with a hole in the centre.</p>

  <p>"I admit that your going to the police with my note surprised me. And it
  really was extraordinarily lucky that I happened to be in the office at the
  time. But it necessitated a slight change of plan on my part. If dear old
  McIver and his minions are outside the house, it's much simpler for me to be
  in. And now, Mr. Latter&mdash;to come to business."</p>

  <p>He stood in front of the bound man, whose eyes were rolling horribly.</p>

  <p>"We believe in making the punishment fit the crime. This afternoon you
  planned to destroy the livelihood of several thousand men with explosive,
  simply that you might make money. Here," he held up the square slab, "is a
  pound of the actual gun-cotton, which was removed from Delmorlick himself
  before he started on a journey to join my other specimens. I propose to place
  this slab under you, Mr. Latter, and to light this piece of fuse which is
  attached to it. The fuse will take about three minutes to burn. During that
  three minutes if you can get free, so much the better for you; if
  not&mdash;well, it would be a pity not to have any explosion at all in
  Sheffield, wouldn't it?"</p>

  <p>For a moment or two Drummond watched the struggling, terrified man, and
  his eyes were hard and merciless. Then he went to the door, and Latter heard
  it opened and shut and moaned horribly. His impotent struggles increased: out
  of the corner of his eye he could see the fire burning nearer and nearer. And
  then all of a sudden something seemed to snap in his brain....</p>

  <p>Four minutes later Drummond came out from the screen behind which he had
  been standing. He picked up the burnt-out fuse and the block of wood to which
  it had been attached. Then he undid the ropes that bound the other man,
  removed the gag and put him back into bed. And after a while he nodded
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Poetic justice," he murmured. "And it saves a lot of trouble."</p>

  <p>Then, after one searching look round the room, he turned out the light and
  stepped quietly into the passage.</p>

  <p>"An extraordinary thing, McIver," said Sir Bryan Johnstone, late on the
  afternoon of the following day. "You say that when you saw Mr. Latter this
  morning he was mad."</p>

  <p>"Mad as a hatter, sir," answered McIver, turning for confirmation to
  Drummond, who was sprawling in a chair.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely up the pole. Tum-tum," agreed Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Gibbered like a fool," said McIver, "and struggled wildly whenever he got
  near the foot of the bed. Seemed terrified of it, somehow. Did you notice
  that, Mr. Drummond?"</p>

  <p>"My dear old lad, it was only ten o'clock, and I was barely conscious,"
  yawned that worthy, lighting a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Well, anyway, you had no trouble with the gang, McIver," said his
  chief.</p>

  <p>"None, sir," agreed the Inspector. "I thought they wouldn't try it on with
  me twice. I heard some fool story just before I caught the train, about one
  of the night-watchmen at a big works who swears he saw a sort of court-
  martial&mdash;he was an old soldier&mdash;being held on three men by a lot of
  black-masked figures. But a lot of these people have got this yarn on the
  brain. Sir Bryan. It's spread a good deal farther than I thought."</p>

  <p>Sir Bryan nodded thoughtfully. "I must say I'd like to know what sent
  Charles Latter mad!"</p>

  <p>Drummond sat up lazily. "Good heavens! Tumkins, don't you know? The house-
  party, old son&mdash;the house-party, they had to be seen to be
  believed."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap6"
     name="chap6">VI. &mdash; IN WHICH AN EFFUSION IS<br>
  SENT TO THE NEWSPAPERS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Take a garrulous night-watchman and an enterprising
  journalist; mix them together over one, or even two glasses of beer, and a
  hard-worked editor feels safe for a column every time. And since the
  night-watchman at Greystone's Steel Works was very garrulous, and the
  journalist was young and ambitious, the result produced several columns of
  the sort of stuff that everybody likes to read, and pretends he doesn't.</p>

  <p>Mr. Day was the night-watchman's name, and Mr. Day was prepared to tell
  his story at a pint a time to anyone who cared to listen. It differed in
  detail, the difference depending entirely on the number of payments received
  during the day, but the essential part remained the same. And it was that
  essential part that was first published in one of the local Sheffield papers,
  and from there found its way into the London Press.</p>

  <p>Mr. Day, it appeared, had, according to his usual custom, been making his
  hourly tour of the works. It was about midnight, or perhaps a little after,
  that he thought he heard the sound of voices coming from the central power-
  station. As he approached, it had seemed to him that it was more lit up than
  it had been on his previous round, when only one electric light had been
  burning. He was on the point of opening the door to go in and investigate,
  when he heard at least half a dozen voices speaking angrily, and one in
  particular had stood out above the others. It was loud and convulsed with
  passion, and on hearing it Mr. Day, remembering his wife and four children,
  had paused.</p>

  <p>"You damned traitor, as sure as there's a God above, I'll kill you for
  this some day."</p>

  <p>Such were the words which it appeared had given Mr. Day cause for
  reflection. At any time, and in any place, they would be apt to stand out
  from the ordinary level of bright chat; but as Mr. Day remarked succinctly,
  "they fair gave me the creeps, coming out o' that there place, which was
  hempty, mind you, not 'alf an hour before."</p>

  <p>And there are few, I think, who can blame him for his decision not to open
  the door, but to substitute for such a course a strategic move to a flank.
  There was an outside flight of steps leading to a door which opened on to the
  upstairs platform where stood the indicator board. And half-way up that
  flight of stairs was a window&mdash;a window through which Mr. Day was
  peering a few seconds afterwards.</p>

  <p>It was at this point in the narrative that Mr. Day was wont to pause,
  while his listeners drew closer. Standing between the four huge dynamos which
  supplied the whole of the power necessary for the works were ten or a dozen
  men. Three of them had their hands lashed behind their backs, and these were
  the only three whose faces he could see. The others&mdash;and here came a
  still more impressive pause&mdash;were completely covered in black from head
  to foot. Black masks&mdash;black cloaks, the only difference between them
  being in height. He couldn't hear what was being said: ever since the Boer
  War Mr. Day had been a little hard of hearing. But what it reminded him of
  was a drum-head court-martial. The three men whose hands were lashed behind
  them were the prisoners; the men in black, standing motionless round them,
  their judges. He heard vaguely the sound of a voice which went on speaking
  for some time. And since the three bound men seemed to be staring at one of
  the masked figures, he concluded that that must be the speaker. Then he saw
  the masked men surround the other three closely, and when they stood back
  again Mr. Day noticed that the prisoners had been gagged as well as bound. It
  was at this moment, apparently, that a hazy idea of going for the police
  penetrated his brain for the first time, but it was too late. Powerless in
  the hands of their captors, the three men were forced to the door, and
  shortly afterwards Mr. Day affirmed that he heard the sound of a car driving
  off. But he was unable to swear to it; he was still flattening a fascinated
  nose against the window; for two of the masked men had remained behind, and
  Mr. Day wasn't going to miss anything.</p>

  <p>These two gathered together into bundles a lot of things that looked like
  wooden slabs&mdash;also some stuff that looked like black cord. Then they
  walked carefully round the whole power station, as if to make sure that
  nothing had been left behind. Apparently satisfied with their inspection,
  they went to the door, carrying the bundles they had collected. They turned
  out all the lights except the one which had originally been burning, took one
  final look round to make certain that everything was as it should be, and
  then they, too, vanished into the night, leaving Mr. Day to scratch his head
  and wonder if he had been dreaming.</p>

  <p>In fact, but for one indisputable certainty, it is very doubtful whether
  Mr. Day's story would have been received with the respect which it
  undoubtedly deserved. When he first recounted it there were scoffers of the
  most incredulous type; scoffers who cast the most libellous reflections on
  the manner in which Mr. Day had spent the evening before going on duty, and
  it was not until the fact became established two or three days later that
  three men who should have come to work the next morning at their different
  jobs not only failed to appear, but had completely disappeared, leaving no
  trace behind them, that the scoffers became silent. Moreover, the
  enterprising journalist came on the scene, and Mr. Day became famous, and Mr.
  Day developed an infinite capacity for beer. Was not he, wildly improbable
  though his story might be, the only person who could throw any light at all
  on the mysterious disappearance of three workmen from Sheffield? Certainly
  the journalist considered he was, and proceeded to write a column of the most
  convincing journalese to proclaim his belief to the world at large, and
  Sheffield in particular.</p>

  <p>Thus was the ball started. And no sooner had it commenced to move than it
  received astonishing impetus from all sorts of unexpected directions. The
  journalist, in his search for copy to keep his infant alive, discovered to
  his astonishment that he had unearthed a full-grown child. The activities of
  the Black Gang were not such a profound mystery as he had at first thought.
  And though he failed to get the slightest clue as to the identity of the men
  composing it, he was soon absolutely convinced of the truth of Mr. Day's
  story. But there he stuck; the whole matter became one of conjecture in his
  mind. That there was a Black Gang, he was certain, but why or wherefore was
  beyond him.</p>

  <p>Men he encountered in odd places were non-committal. Some obviously knew
  nothing about it; others shrugged their shoulders and looked wise.</p>

  <p>There was one group of youngish men he approached on the matter. They were
  standing at the corner of the long street which led from Greystone's Works,
  muttering together, and their conversation ceased abruptly as he sauntered
  up.</p>

  <p>"Journalist, are you?" said one. "Want to know about this 'ere Black Gang?
  Well, look 'ere, mister, I'll tell you one thing. See them furnaces over
  there?"</p>

  <p>He pointed to the ruddy, orange light of Greystone's huge furnaces,
  glowing fiercely against the evening sky.</p>

  <p>"Well, if me and my mates ever catch the leader of that there gang, or
  anybody wot's connected with it, they goes in them furnaces alive."</p>

  <p>"Shut up, yer blasted fool!" cried one of the others.</p>

  <p>"Think I'm afraid of that bunch!" snarled the first speaker. "A bunch
  wot's frightened to show their faces..."</p>

  <p>But the journalist had passed on.</p>

  <p>"Don't you pay no attention to them young fools, mate," said an elderly,
  quiet-looking man, who was standing smoking in a doorway a few yards on.
  "They talks too much and they does too little."</p>

  <p>"I was asking them about this so-called Black Gang," said the searcher
  after news.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" The elderly man spat thoughtfully. "Don't profess to know nothing
  about them myself; but if wot I've 'card is true, we could do with a few more
  like 'em."</p>

  <p>And once more the journalist passed on.</p>

  <p>The police refused point-blank to make any communications on the matter at
  all. They had heard Mr. Day's story, and while not disposed to dismiss it
  entirely, they would not say that they were prepared to accept it completely;
  and since it was a jolly day outside, and they were rather busy, the door was
  along the passage to the left.</p>

  <p>Such were the ingredients, then, with which one, and sometimes two columns
  daily were made up for the edification of the inhabitants of Sheffield. Brief
  notices appeared in one or two of the London dailies, coupled with the
  announcement that Mr. Charles Latter had suffered a nervous breakdown, and
  that this well-known M.P. had gone into a nursing-home for some weeks. But
  beyond that the matter was too local to be of importance, until a sudden
  dramatic development revived the flagging interest in Sheffield, and brought
  the matter into the national limelight.</p>

  <p>It was nothing more nor less than an announcement purporting to come from
  the leader of the Black Gang himself, and sent to the editor of the Sheffield
  paper. It occupied a prominent position in the centre page, and was
  introduced to the public in the following words:</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"The following communication has been received by the
  editor. The original, which he has handed over to the proper authorities, was
  typewritten; the postmark was a London one. The editor offers no comment on
  the genuineness of the document, beyond stating that it is printed exactly as
  it was received."</p>

  <p>The document ran as follows:</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"In view of the conflicting rumours started by the story
  of Mr. Day, the night-watchman at Greystone's Works, it may be of interest to
  the public to know that his story is true in every detail. The three men whom
  he saw bound were engaged at the instigation of others in an attempt to wreck
  the main power station, thereby largely increasing unemployment in Sheffield,
  and fomenting more unrest. The driving force behind this, as behind other
  similar activities, is international. The source of it all lies in other
  countries; the object is the complete ruin of the great sober majority of
  workers in England by a loud-voiced, money-seeking minority which is composed
  of unscrupulous scoundrels and fanatical madmen. For these apostles of
  anarchy a home has been prepared, where the doctrines of Communism are
  strictly enforced. The three men who have disappeared from Sheffield have
  gone to that home, but there is still plenty of room for others. Mr. Charles
  Latter has gone mad, otherwise he would have accompanied them. The more
  intelligent the man, the more vile the scoundrel. Charles Latter was
  intelligent. There are others more intelligent than he. It is expressly for
  their benefit that the Black Gang came into being. (Signed) THE LEADER OF THE
  GANG."</p>

  <p>The reception of this remarkable document was mixed. On the strength of
  the first sentence Mr. Day's price rose to two pints; but it was the rest of
  the communication which aroused public interest. For the first time some
  tangible reason had been advanced to account for the presence of the three
  bound men and their masked captors in the power-station at Greystones.
  Inquiries revealed the fact that all three of them were men educated above
  the average, and of very advanced Socialistic views. And to that extent the
  document seemed credible. But it was the concluding sentences that baffled
  the public.</p>

  <p>True, Mr. Charles Latter, M.P., had been staying on the night in question
  at Lady Manton's house a few miles out of the town. Equally true he had had a
  nervous breakdown which necessitated his removal to a nursing-home in London.
  But what connection there could possibly be between him and the three men it
  was difficult to see. It was most positively asserted that the well-known
  Member of Parliament had not left Drayton House during the night on which the
  affair took place; and yet, if credence was to be attached to the document,
  there was an intimate connection between him and the affair at the steel
  works. Callers at the nursing-home came away none the wiser; his doctor had
  positively forbidden a soul to be admitted save his brother, who came away
  frowning after the first visit, and returned no more. For Charles Latter not
  only had not recognised him, but had shrunk away, babbling nonsense, while
  continually his eyes had sought the foot of the bed with a look of dreadful
  terror in them.</p>

  <p>And so speculation continued. No further communication emanated from the
  mysterious Black Gang. Mr. Latter was insane; the three men had disappeared,
  and Mr. Day, even at two pints, could say no more than he had said already.
  There were people who dismissed the entire thing as an impudent and
  impertinent hoax, and stated that the editor of the Sheffield paper should be
  prosecuted for libel. It was obvious, they explained, what had occurred. Some
  irresponsible practical joker had, for reasons of his own, connected together
  the two acts, whose only real connection was that they had occurred about the
  same time, and had maliciously sent the letter to the paper.</p>

  <p>But there were others who were not so sure&mdash;people who nodded wisely
  at one another from the corners of trains, and claimed inside knowledge of
  strange happenings unknown to the mere public. They affirmed darkly that
  there was more in it than met the eye, and relapsed into confidential
  mutterings.</p>

  <p>And then, when nothing further happened, the matter died out of the
  papers, and speculation ceased amongst the public. The general impression
  left behind favoured a hoax; and at that it was allowed to remain until the
  events occurred which were to prove that it was a very grim reality.</p>

  <p>But whatever the general public may have thought about the matter, there
  were two people in London who viewed the sudden newspaper notoriety with rage
  and anger. And it is, perhaps, needless to say that neither of them concurred
  in the impression that it was a hoax; only too well did they know that it was
  nothing of the kind.</p>

  <p>The first of these was Count Zadowa, alias Mr. William Atkinson. He had
  duly received from Latter a telegram in code stating that everything was
  well&mdash;a telegram dispatched from Sheffield after the meeting with
  Delmorlick in the afternoon. And from that moment he had heard nothing. The
  early editions of the evening papers on the following day had contained no
  reference to any explosion at Sheffield; the later ones had announced Mr.
  Latter's nervous breakdown. And the Count, reading between the lines, had
  wondered, though at that time he was far from guessing the real truth. Then
  had come strange rumours&mdash;rumours which resulted in the summoning
  post-haste from Sheffield of a man who was alluded to in the archives at 5,
  Green Street, as John Smith, commission agent. And, though he may have fully
  deserved the description of commission agent, a glance at his face gave one
  to wonder at his right to the name of John Smith.</p>

  <p>"Tell me exactly what has happened," said the Count quietly, pointing to a
  chair in his inner office. "Up to date I have only heard rumours."</p>

  <p>And John Smith, with the accent of a Polish Jew, told. Mr. Latter had
  called on him early in the afternoon, and, in accordance with his
  instructions, he had arranged a meeting between Mr. Latter and Delmorlick at
  an hotel. Delmorlick had taken three other men with him, and he presumed
  everything had been arranged at that meeting. No, he had not been present
  himself. For two of Delmorlick's companions he could vouch; in fact&mdash;and
  then, for the first time, Count Zadowa heard the story so ably spread abroad
  by Mr. Day. For it was those two men and Delmorlick who had disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Then it was the fourth man, who gave it away," snapped the Count. "Who
  was he?"</p>

  <p>"He called himself Jackson," faltered the other. "But I haven't seen him
  since."</p>

  <p>Thoughtfully the Count beat a tattoo with his fingers on the desk in front
  of him; no one looking at him would have guessed for an instant the rage that
  was seething in his brain. For the first time he realised fully that, perfect
  though his own organisation might be, he had come up against one that was
  still better.</p>

  <p>"And what about this nervous breakdown of Mr. Latter's?" he demanded at
  length.</p>

  <p>But on that subject John Smith knew nothing. He had no ideas on the
  subject, and, after a few searching questions, he found himself curtly
  dismissed, leaving the Count to ponder over the knotty point as to the
  connection between Latter's breakdown and the affair at the power-station.
  And he was still pondering over it three days later when the bombshell
  exploded in the form of the document to the Press. That the concluding
  sentences were evidently directed against him did not worry him nearly as
  much as the publicity afforded to activities in which secrecy was essential.
  And what worried him even more was the fact that others on the
  Continent&mdash;men whose names were never mentioned, but who regarded him
  almost as he regarded Latter&mdash;would see the English papers, and would
  form their own conclusions. Already some peremptory letters had reached him,
  stating that the activities of the Black Gang must cease&mdash;how, it was
  immaterial. And he had replied stating that he had the thing well in hand. On
  top of which had come this damnable document, which was published in
  practically every paper in the country, and had produced a sort of
  silly-season discussion from "Retired Colonel" and "Maiden Lady." Of no
  importance to him that "Common Sense" decreed that it was a stupid hoax: he
  knew it was not. And so did those others, as he very soon found out. Two days
  after the appearance of the document, he received a letter which bore the
  postmark of Amsterdam. It stated merely: "I am coming," and was signed X. And
  had anyone been present when Count Zadowa opened that letter in his private
  office, he would have seen an unexpected sight. He would have seen him tear
  the letter into a thousand pieces, and then wipe his forehead with a hand
  that trembled a little. For Count Zadowa, who terrified most men, was
  frightened himself.</p>

  <p>The second person who viewed this sudden notoriety with dislike was
  Inspector McIver. And in his case, too, the reason was largely personal. He
  was caught on the horns of a dilemma, as Sir Bryan Johnstone, who was not too
  pleased with the turn of events, pointed out to him a little caustically.
  Either the entire thing was a hoax, in which case why had McIver himself
  taken such elaborate precautions to prevent anything happening? or it was not
  a hoax, in which case McIver had been made a complete fool of.</p>

  <p>"I'll stake my reputation on the fact that no one got into or left the
  house that night. Sir Bryan," he reiterated again and again. "That the Black
  Gang was at work in the town, I admit; but I do not believe that Mr. Latter's
  condition is anything more that a strange coincidence."</p>

  <p>It was an interview that he had with Mr. Latter's brother that caused him
  to go round to Drummond's house in Brook Street. Much as he disliked having
  to do so, he felt he must leave no stone unturned if he was to get to the
  bottom of the affair, and Mr. Latter's brother had said one or two things
  which he thought might be worth following up. If only Hugh Drummond wasn't
  such a confounded fool, he reflected savagely, as he turned into Bond Street,
  it would have been possible to get some sane information. But that was his
  chief's fault; he entirely washed his hands of the responsibility of roping
  in such a vast idiot; And it was at that stage in his meditations that a
  Rolls-Royce drew silently up beside him, and the cheerful voice of the
  subject of his thoughts hailed him delightedly.</p>

  <p>"The very man, and the very spot!"</p>

  <p>McIver turned round and nodded briefly. "Morning, Captain Drummond! I was
  just going round to your house to see you."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear old top," cried Hugh, "don't you see where you are? The
  portals of the Regency positively beckon us. Behind those portals a cocktail
  apiece, and you shall tell me all your troubles." He gently propelled the
  Inspector through the doors of the celebrated club, still babbling
  cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"After profound experience, old lad," he remarked, coming to anchor by the
  bar, "I have come to the conclusion that there is only one thing in this
  world better than having a cocktail at twelve o'clock."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" said McIver perfunctorily.</p>

  <p>"Having two," answered Drummond triumphantly.</p>

  <p>The Inspector smiled wanly. After his profound experience he had come to
  the conclusion that there could exist no bigger ass in the world than
  Drummond, but he followed a trade where at times it is necessary to suffer
  fools gladly. And this was one of them.</p>

  <p>"Is there any place where we could have a little private talk, Captain
  Drummond?" he asked, as the other pushed a Martini towards him.</p>

  <p>"What about that corner over there?" said Drummond, after glancing round
  the room.</p>

  <p>"Excellent!" agreed the Inspector, and, picking up his cocktail, he
  crossed over to it and sat down. It took his host nearly five minutes to do
  the same short journey, and McIver chafed irritably at the delay. He was a
  busy man, and it seemed to him that Drummond knew everyone in the room.
  Moreover, he insisted on talking to them at length. And once again a feeling
  of anger against his chief filled his mind. What had Drummond except his
  great strength to distinguish him from this futile crowd of cocktail-drinking
  men? All of them built on the same pattern; all of them fashioned along the
  same lines. Talking a strange jargon of their own&mdash;idle, perfectly
  groomed, bored. As far as they were concerned, he was non-existent save as
  the man who was with Drummond. He smiled a little grimly; he, who did more
  man's work in a week than the whole lot of them put together got through in a
  year. A strange caste, he reflected, as he sipped his drink; a caste which
  does not aim at, because it essentially is, good form; a caste which knows
  only one fetish&mdash;the absolute repression of all visible emotion; a caste
  which incidentally pulled considerably more than its own weight in the war.
  McIver gave them credit for that.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to be so long." Drummond lowered himself into a chair. "The place
  is always crowded at this hour. Now, what's the little worry?"</p>

  <p>"It's about the affair up at Sheffield," said the Inspector. "I suppose
  you've seen this communication in the papers, purporting to come from the
  leader of the Black Gang."</p>

  <p>"Rather, old lad," answered Drummond. "Waded through it over the eggs the
  other morning. Pretty useful effort, I thought."</p>

  <p>"The public at large regard it as a hoax," continued McIver. "Now, I know
  it isn't! The typewriter used in the original document is the same as was
  used in their previous communications."</p>

  <p>"By Jove, that's quick!" said Drummond admiringly. "Deuced quick."</p>

  <p>McIver frowned. "Now please concentrate. Captain Drummond. The concluding
  sentence of the letter would lead one to suppose that there was some
  connection between the activities of this gang and Mr. Charles Latter's
  present condition. I, personally, don't believe it. I think it was mere
  coincidence. But whichever way it is, I would give a great deal to know what
  sent him mad."</p>

  <p>"Is he absolutely up the pole?" demanded Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely! His brother has seen him, and after he had seen him he came
  to me. He tells me that the one marked symptom is an overmastering terror of
  something which he seems to see at the foot of the bed. He follows this thing
  round with his eyes&mdash;I suppose he thinks it's coming towards
  him&mdash;and then he screams. His brother believes that someone or something
  must have been in his room that night&mdash;a something so terrifying that it
  sent him mad. To my mind, of course, the idea is wildly improbable, but
  strange things do occur."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly!" agreed Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Now you were in the house," went on the Inspector; "you even examined his
  room, as you told Sir Bryan. Now, did you examine it closely?"</p>

  <p>"Even to looking under the bed," answered Drummond brightly.</p>

  <p>"And there was nothing there? No place where anybody or anything could
  hide?"</p>

  <p>"Not a vestige of a spot. In fact, my dear old police hound," continued
  Drummond, draining his glass, "if the genial brother is correct in his
  supposition, the only conclusion we can come to is that I sent him mad
  myself."</p>

  <p>McIver frowned again.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd be serious. Captain Drummond. There are other things in life
  beside cocktails and&mdash;this." He waved an expressive hand round the room.
  "The matter is an important one. You can give me no further information? You
  heard no sounds during the night?"</p>

  <p>"Only the sheep-faced man snoring," answered Drummond with a grin. And
  then, of a sudden, he became serious and, leaning across the table, he stared
  fixedly at the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"I think we must conclude, McIver, that the madness of Mr. Latter is due
  to the ghosts of the past, and perhaps the spectres of the present. A
  punishment, McIver, for things done which it is not good to do&mdash;a
  punishment which came to him in the night. That's when the ghosts are
  abroad." He noted McIver's astonished face and gradually his own relaxed into
  a smile. "Pretty good, that&mdash;wasn't it, after only one cocktail. You
  ought to hear me after my third."</p>

  <p>"Thanks very much. Captain Drummond," laughed the Inspector, "but that was
  quite good enough for me. We don't deal in ghosts in my service."</p>

  <p>"Well, I've done my best," sighed Drummond, waving languidly at a waiter
  to repeat the dose. "It's either that or me. I know my face is pretty bad,
  but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't think we need worry about either alternative," said McIver,
  rising.</p>

  <p>"Right oh, old lad," answered Drummond. "You know best. You'll have
  another?"</p>

  <p>"No more, thanks. I have to work sometimes."</p>

  <p>The inspector picked up his hat and stick, and Drummond strolled across
  the room with him. "Give my love to Tum-tum."</p>

  <p>"Sir Bryan is not at the office to-day. Captain Drummond," answered McIver
  coldly. "Good morning."</p>

  <p>With a faint smile Drummond watched the square, sturdy figure swing
  through the doors into Bond Street, then he turned and thoughtfully made his
  way back to the table.</p>

  <p>"Make it seven, instead of two," he told the waiter, who was hovering
  round.</p>

  <p>And had McIver returned at that moment he would have seen six of these
  imperturbable, bored men rise unobtrusively from different parts of the room,
  and saunter idly across to the corner where he had recently been sitting. It
  would probably not have struck him as an unusual sight&mdash;Drummond and six
  of his pals having a second drink; in fact, it would have struck him as being
  very usual. He was an unimaginative man, was the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Peter Darrell, lighting a cigarette. "And what had he got to
  say?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing of interest," answered Drummond. "I told him the truth, and he
  wouldn't believe me. Algy back yet?"</p>

  <p>"This morning," said Ted Jerningham. "He's coming round here. Had a bit of
  trouble, I gather. And, talk of the devil&mdash;here he is."</p>

  <p>Algy Longworth, his right arm in a sling, was threading his way towards
  them.</p>

  <p>"What's happened, Algy?" said Hugh as he came up.</p>

  <p>"That firebrand Delmorlick stuck a knife into me," grinned Algy. "We put
  him on a rope and dropped him overboard, and towed him for three hundred
  yards. Cooled his ardour. I think he'll live all right."</p>

  <p>"And how are all the specimens?"</p>

  <p>"Prime, old son&mdash;prime! If we leave 'em long enough, they'll all have
  murdered one another."</p>

  <p>Drummond put down his empty glass with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"The first British Soviet. Long life to 'em! Incidentally, ten o'clock to-
  night. Usual rendezvous. In view of your arm, Algy&mdash;transfer your
  instructions to Ted. You've got 'em?"</p>

  <p>"In my pocket here. But, Hugh, I can easily&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Transfer to Ted, please. No argument! We've got a nice little
  job&mdash;possibly some sport. Read 'em, Ted&mdash;and business as usual. So
  long, boys! Phyllis and I are lunching with some awe-inspiring
  relatives."</p>

  <p>The group broke up as casually as it had formed, only Ted Jerningham
  remaining behind. And he was reading what looked like an ordinary letter. He
  read it through carefully six or seven times; then he placed it in the fire,
  watching it until it was reduced to ashes. A few minutes later he was sitting
  down to lunch with his father. Sir Patrick Jerningham, Bart., at the latter's
  club in Pall Mall. And it is possible that that worthy and conscientious
  gentleman would not have eaten such a hearty meal had he known that his only
  son was detailed for a job that very night which, in the event of failure,
  would mean either prison or a knife in the back&mdash;probably the
  latter.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap7"
     name="chap7">VII. &mdash; IN WHICH A BOMB BURSTS<br>
  AT UNPLEASANTLY CLOSE QUARTERS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was perhaps because the thought of failure never entered
  Hugh Drummond's head that such a considerable measure of success had been
  possible up to date&mdash;that, and the absolute, unquestioning obedience
  which he demanded of his pals, and which they accorded him willingly. As they
  knew, he laid no claims to brilliance; but as they also knew, he hid a very
  shrewd common sense beneath his frivolous manner. And having once accepted
  the sound military truism that one indifferent general is better than two
  good ones, they accepted his leadership with unswerving loyalty. What was
  going to be the end of their self-imposed fight against the pests of society
  did not worry them greatly; all that mattered was that there should be a
  certain amount of sport in the collection of the specimens. Granted the
  promise of that, they willingly sacrificed any engagements and carried out
  Hugh's orders to the letter. Up to date, however, the campaign, though far
  from being dull, had not produced any really big results. A number of sprats
  and a few moderate-sized fish had duly been caught in the landing-net, and
  been sent to the private pool to meditate at leisure. But nothing really
  large had come their way. Zaboleff was a good haul, and the madness of Mr.
  Latter was all for the national welfare. But the Black Gang, which aimed
  merely at the repression of terrorism by terrorism, had found it too easy.
  The nauseating cowardice of the majority of their opponents was becoming
  monotonous, their strong aversion to soap and water, insanitary. They wanted
  big game&mdash;not the rats that emerged from the sewers.</p>

  <p>Even Drummond had begun to feel that patriotism might be carried too far
  until the moment when the address in Hoxton had fallen into his hands. Then,
  with the optimism that lives eternal in the hunter's breast, fresh hope had
  arisen in his mind. It had been held in abeyance temporarily owing to the
  little affair at Sheffield. Yet now that that was over he had determined on a
  bigger game. If it failed&mdash;if they drew blank&mdash;he had almost
  decided to chuck the thing up altogether. Phyllis, he knew, would be
  overjoyed if he did.</p>

  <p>"Just this one final coup, old girl," he said, as they sat waiting in the
  Carlton for the awe-inspiring relatives. "I've got it cut and dried, and it
  comes off to-night. If it's a dud, we'll dissolve ourselves&mdash;at any
  rate, for the present. If only&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He sighed, and his wife looked at him reproachfully. "I know you want
  another fight with Petersen, you old goat," she remarked. "But you'll never
  see him again, or that horrible girl."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think I shall, Phyl?" He stared despondently at his shoes. "I
  can't help feeling myself that somewhere or other behind all this that cheery
  bird is lurking. My dear, it would be too ghastly if I never saw him
  again."</p>

  <p>"The next time you see him, Hugh," she answered quietly, "he won't take
  any chances with you."</p>

  <p>"But, my angel child," he boomed cheerfully. "I don't want him to. Not on
  your life! Nor shall I. Good Lord! Here they are. Uncle Timothy looks more
  like a mangel-wurzel than ever."</p>

  <p>And so at nine-thirty that evening, a party of five men sat waiting in a
  small sitting-room of a house situated in a remote corner of South
  Kensington. Some easels stood round the walls covered with half-finished
  sketches, as befitted a room belonging to a budding artist such as Toby
  Sinclair. Not that he was an artist or even a budding one, but he felt that a
  man must have some excuse for living in South Kensington. And so he had
  bought the sketches and put them round the room, principally to deceive the
  landlady. The fact that he was never there except at strange hours merely
  confirmed that excellent woman's opinion that all artists were dissolute
  rascals. But he paid his rent regularly, and times were hard, especially in
  South Kensington. Had the worthy soul known that her second best sitting-room
  was the rendezvous of this Black Gang whose letter to the paper she and her
  husband had discussed over the matutinal kipper, it is doubtful if she would
  have been so complacent. But she didn't know, and continued her weekly
  dusting of the sketches with characteristic zeal.</p>

  <p>"Ted should be here soon," said Drummond, glancing at his watch. "I hope
  he's got the bird all right."</p>

  <p>"You didn't get into the inner room, did you, Hugh?" said Peter
  Darrell.</p>

  <p>"No. But I saw enough to know that it's beyond our form, old lad. We've
  got to have a skilled cracksman to deal with one of the doors&mdash;and
  almost certainly anything important will be in a safe inside."</p>

  <p>"Just run over the orders again." Toby Sinclair came back from drawing the
  blinds even more closely together.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly simple," said Hugh. "Ted and I and Ginger Martin&mdash;if he's
  got him&mdash;will go straight into the house through the front door. I know
  the geography of the place all right, and I've already laid out the caretaker
  clerk fellow once. Then we must trust to luck. There shouldn't be anybody
  there except the little blighter of a clerk. The rest of you will hang about
  outside in case of any trouble. Don't bunch together, keep on the move; but
  keep the doors in sight. When you see us come out again, make your own way
  home. Can't give you any more detailed instructions because I don't know what
  may turn up. I shall rig myself out here, after Ted arrives. You had better
  go to your own rooms and do it, but wait first to make sure that he's roped
  in Ginger Martin."</p>

  <p>He glanced up as the door opened and Jerry Seymour&mdash;sometime of the
  R.A.F.&mdash;put his head into the room.</p>

  <p>"Ted's here, and he got the bird all right. Unpleasant-looking bloke with
  a flattened face."</p>

  <p>"Right." Drummond rose, and crossed to a cupboard. "Clear off, you
  fellows. Zero&mdash;twelve midnight."</p>

  <p>From the cupboard he pulled a long black cloak and mask, which he
  proceeded to put on, while the others disappeared with the exception of Jerry
  Seymour, who came into the room. He was dressed in livery like a chauffeur,
  and he had, in fact, been driving the car in which Ted had brought Ginger
  Martin.</p>

  <p>"Any trouble?" asked Drummond.</p>

  <p>"No. Once he was certain Ted was nothing to do with the police he came
  like a bird," said Jerry. "The fifty quid did it." Then he grinned. "You know
  Ted's a marvel. I'll defy anybody to recognise him."</p>

  <p>Drummond nodded, and sat down at the table facing the door.</p>

  <p>"Tell Ted to bring him up. And I don't want him to see you, Jerry, so keep
  out of the light."</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly Jerry Seymour was right with regard to Jerningham's make-up.
  As he and Martin came into the room, it was only the sudden start and cry on
  the part of the crook that made Drummond certain as to which was which.</p>

  <p>"Blimey!" muttered the man, shrinking back as he saw the huge figure in
  black confronting him. "Wot's the game, guv'nor?"</p>

  <p>"There's no game, Martin," said Drummond reassuringly. "You've been told
  what you're wanted for, haven't you? A little professional assistance to-
  night, for which you will be paid fifty pounds, is all we ask of you."</p>

  <p>But Ginger Martin still seemed far from easy in his mind. Like most of the
  underworld he had heard strange stories of the Black Gang long before they
  had attained the notoriety of print. Many of them were exaggerated,
  doubtless, but the general impression left in his mind was one of fear. The
  police were always with him: the police he understood. But this strange gang
  was beyond his comprehension, and that in itself was sufficient to frighten
  him.</p>

  <p>"You're one of this 'ere Black Gang," he said sullenly, glancing at the
  door in front of which Jerningham was standing Should he chance it and make a
  dash to get away? Fifty pounds are fifty pounds, but&mdash;He gave a little
  shiver as his eyes came round again to the motionless figure on the other
  side of the table.</p>

  <p>"Quite correct, Martin," said the same reassuring voice. "And it's only
  because I don't want you to recognise me that I'm dressed up like this. We
  don't mean you any harm." The voice paused for a moment, and then went on
  again. "You understand that, Martin. We don't mean you any harm, unless
  "&mdash;and once again there came a pause&mdash;"unless you try any monkey
  tricks. You are to do exactly as I tell you, without question and at once. If
  you do you will receive fifty pounds. If you don't&mdash;well, Martin, I have
  ways of dealing with people who don't do what I tell them."</p>

  <p>There was silence while Ginger Martin fidgeted about, looking like a
  trapped animal. How he wished now that he'd had nothing to do with the thing
  at all. But it was too late to bother about that; here he was, utterly
  ignorant of his whereabouts&mdash;trapped.</p>

  <p>"What do yer want me to do, guv'nor?" he said at last.</p>

  <p>"Open a safe amongst other things," answered Drummond. "Have you brought
  your tools and things?"</p>

  <p>"Yus&mdash;I've brought the outfit," muttered the other. "Where is the
  safe? 'Ere?"</p>

  <p>"No, Martin, not here. Some distance away in fact. We shall start in about
  an hour. Until then you will stop in this room. You can have a whisky-and-
  soda, and my friend here will stay with you. He has a gun, Martin, so
  remember what I said. No monkey tricks."</p>

  <p>With fascinated eyes the crook watched the speaker rise and cross to an
  inner door. Standing he seemed more huge than ever, and Martin gave a sigh of
  relief as the door closed behind him.</p>

  <p>"I reckon 'e wouldn't win a prize as a blinking dwarf," he remarked
  hoarsely to Jerningham. "I say, mister, wot abaht that there whisky-and-
  soda?"</p>

  <p>The entrance to Number 5, Green Street, proved easier than Drummond had
  expected&mdash;so easy as to be almost suspicious. No lights shone in the
  windows above: the house seemed completely deserted. Moreover, the door into
  the street was unbolted, and without a moment's hesitation Drummond opened it
  and stepped inside, followed by Martin and Ted Jerningham. The long black
  cloak had been discarded; only the black mask concealed his face, as the
  three men stood inside the door, listening intently. Not a sound was audible,
  and after a moment or two Drummond felt his way cautiously through the
  downstairs office towards the flight of stairs that led to the rooms above.
  And it was just as his foot was on the first stair that a sudden noise behind
  made him draw back sharply into the darkness behind the counter, with a
  warning whisper to the other two to follow his example.</p>

  <p>The front door had opened again; someone else had come in. They could see
  nothing, and the only sound seemed to be the slightly quickened breathing of
  Ted Jerningham, whose nerve was not quite as good as the others at affairs of
  this sort. Then came the sound of bolts being shot home, and footsteps coming
  into the office.</p>

  <p>With a whispered "Stay there," Drummond glided across towards the door
  like a shadow, moving with uncanny silence for such a big man. And a moment
  or two afterwards someone came into the office. Jerningham, crouching against
  the crook behind the counter, could see the outline of a figure framed in the
  faint light that filtered in from a street lamp through the fanlight over the
  door. Then there was a click, and the electric light was switched on.</p>

  <p>For a second the newcomer failed to see them; then, with a sudden gasp he
  stiffened, and stood staring at them rigidly. It was Cohen, the unpleasant
  little clerk, returning from an evening out, which accounted for the front
  door having been unbolted. And undoubtedly his luck was out. Because, having
  seen the two of them there behind the counter, he somewhat naturally failed
  to look for anybody else. It would not have made any great difference if he
  had, but the expression on his face as he felt two enormous hands close
  gently but firmly round his throat from behind caused even the phlegmatic
  Ginger to chuckle grimly.</p>

  <p>"Out with the light," snapped Drummond, "then help me lash him up and gag
  him."</p>

  <p>It was done quickly and deftly, and for the second time in a week the
  wretched Cohen was laid under his own counter to cool. It had been carried
  out as noiselessly as possible, but it was five minutes before Drummond again
  led the way cautiously up the stairs. And during that five minutes the three
  men listened with every sense alert, striving to differentiate between the
  ordinary street noises and anything unusual in the house above them. But not
  even Drummond's ears, trained as they had been for many nights in No Man's
  Land, could detect anything. All seemed as quiet as the grave.</p>

  <p>"It probably is empty except for that little rat," he whispered to
  Jerningham. "But we'll take no chances."</p>

  <p>In single file they crept up the stairs, Drummond leading. The door at the
  top was ajar, and for a while they stood in the carpeted passage above
  listening again.</p>

  <p>"Along this passage are the clerks' offices," he explained in a low voice
  to the other two. "At the far end is another door which we shall probably
  find locked. Beyond that is the inner office, which we want."</p>

  <p>"Well, let's get on wiv it, guvnor," muttered Ginger Martin hoarsely.
  "There's no good in 'anging abaht."</p>

  <p>Drummond switched on his electric torch, and flashed it cautiously round.
  Doors leading off the passage were open in most cases, and all the rooms were
  empty; it was obvious that none of the staff were about. And yet he felt an
  indefinable sense of danger, which he tried in vain to shake off. Somehow or
  other, he felt certain that they were not alone&mdash;that there were other
  people in the house, besides the trussed-up clerk below. But Ginger Martin
  had no such presentiments, and was rapidly becoming impatient. To open the
  door at the end of the passage, if it should prove to be locked, was child's
  play as to be absolutely contemptible. He wanted to get on with the safe,
  which might take time, instead of fooling round in a passage listening for
  mice.</p>

  <p>At last Drummond moved slowly forward with the other two just behind him.
  Whatever he may have thought, he had every intention of going through with
  the job, and delay in such cases only tends to turn vague fears into certain
  realities. Gently he tried the door at the end of the passage; as he had
  anticipated it was locked.</p>

  <p>"'Old the light, guv'nor, so that it shines on the blinkin' key-'ole!"
  said Ginger Martin impatiently. "I'll get this open as easy as kiss yer
  'and."</p>

  <p>Without a sound, the cracksman set to work; his coarse features outlined
  in the circle of the torch, his ill-kept fingers handling his instruments as
  deftly as any surgeon. A little oil here and there; a steady pressure with a
  short pointed steel tool; a faint click.</p>

  <p>"There you are, guv'nor," he muttered, straightening up. "Easy as kiss yer
  'and. And if yer waits till I find me glove I'll open it for yer; but Ginger
  Martin's finger-prints are too well known to run any risks."</p>

  <p>Still no sound came from anywhere, though the click as the lock shot back
  had seemed horribly loud in the silence. And then, just as Martin cautiously
  turned the handle and pushed open the door, Drummond stiffened suddenly and
  switched off his torch. He could have sworn that he heard the sound of voices
  close by.</p>

  <p>Only for a second&mdash;they were instantly silenced; but just for that
  fraction of time as the door opened he felt certain he had heard men
  speaking.</p>

  <p>"Wot's the matter?" he heard Martin's hoarse whisper come out of the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear voices?" he breathed in reply. "I thought I did as you
  opened the door."</p>

  <p>Once again the three men stood motionless, listening intently, but the
  sound was not repeated. Absolute silence reigned, broken only by the noise of
  their own breathing. And at last, after what seemed an interminable pause,
  Drummond switched on his torch again. The passage was empty; the door of the
  inner office was just in front of them. Almost he was persuaded that he must
  have made a mistake&mdash;that it had been his imagination. He peered through
  the keyhole: the room was in darkness. He turned the handle cautiously; the
  door gave to him; and still with his torch held well in front of him, he
  stepped into the room, turning the light into every corner. Not a trace of
  anyone; the inner office was absolutely empty. He flashed the light all round
  the walls, as far as he could see there was no other door&mdash;not even a
  window. Consequently the only way out was by the door through which they had
  just entered, which was obviously impossible for anyone to have done without
  his knowledge.</p>

  <p>"It is all right!" he muttered, turning round to the other two. "Must have
  been my mistake. Let's get on with it."</p>

  <p>"There's a mighty strong smell of cigar smoke," said Jerningham
  dubiously.</p>

  <p>"No ventilation, old man," returned Drummond. "Hangs about for hours. No
  other door, no window. Now then. Ginger, let's tackle the big desk first. It
  looks pretty easy, even to me."</p>

  <p>As he spoke he moved into the centre of the room, his torch lighting up
  the big roll-top desk.</p>

  <p>"Right-ho, guv'nor. Keep the beam on the keyhole&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The crook bent over his task, only to straighten up suddenly as all the
  lights went on.</p>

  <p>"Yer damned fool!" he snarled. "Switch 'em off! It ain't safe."</p>

  <p>"I didn't put 'em on!" snapped Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Nor I," said Jerningham.</p>

  <p>For a moment or two no one spoke; then Ginger Martin made a wild dive for
  the door. But the door which had opened so easily a few moments before now
  refused to budge, though he tugged at it, cursing horribly. And after a while
  he gave it up, and turned on Drummond like a wild beast.</p>

  <p>"You've trapped me, yer&mdash;swine. I'll get even with you over this if I
  swing for it!"</p>

  <p>But Drummond, to whom the presence of actual danger was as meat and drink,
  took not the slightest notice. His brain, ice-cold and clear, was moving
  rapidly. It had not been a mistake, he had heard voices&mdash;voices which
  came from that very room in which they now were. Men had been there&mdash;men
  who had got out by some other way. And Ginger Martin was trapped&mdash;all of
  them. More out of thoughtlessness than anything else, he brushed the swearing
  crook aside with the back of his hand&mdash;much as one brushes away a
  troublesome fly. And Martin, feeling as if he'd been kicked in the mouth by a
  horse, ceased to swear....</p>

  <p>It was uncanny&mdash;devilish. The room was empty, save for them, suddenly
  flooded with light. But by whom? Drummond felt they were being watched. But
  by whom? And then suddenly he heard Ted Jerningham's voice, low and
  tense.</p>

  <p>"There's a man watching us, Hugh. I can see his eyes. In that big safe
  door."</p>

  <p>Like a flash, Drummond swung round, and looked at the safe. Ted was right;
  he could see the eyes himself, and they were fixed on him with an expression
  of malignant fury through a kind of opening that looked like the slit in a
  letter box. For a moment or two they remained there, staring at him, then
  they disappeared, and the opening through which he had seen them disappeared
  also, and seemed to become part of the door. And it was just as he was moving
  towards this mysterious safe to examine it closer that with a sudden clang,
  another opening appeared&mdash;one much larger than the first. He stopped
  involuntarily as something was thrown through into the room&mdash; something
  which hissed and spluttered.</p>

  <p>For a moment he gazed at it uncomprehendingly as it lay on the floor; then
  he gave a sudden, tense order.</p>

  <p>"On your faces&mdash;for your lives!" His voice cut through the room like
  a knife. "Behind the desk, you fools! It's a bomb!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap8"
     name="chap8">VIII. &mdash; IN WHICH THE BAG OF NUTS<br>
  IS FOUND BY ACCIDENT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was the desk that saved Drummond, and with him Ted
  Jerningham. Flat on their faces, their arms covering their heads, they lay on
  the floor waiting, as in days gone by they had waited for the bursting of a
  too-near crump. They heard Ginger Martin, as he blundered round the room, and
  then&mdash;suddenly it came.</p>

  <p>There was a deafening roar, and a sheet of flame which seemed to fill the
  room. Great lumps of the ceiling rained down and the big roll-top desk,
  cracked in pieces and splintered into matchwood, fell over on top of them.
  But it had done its work: it had borne the full force of the explosion in
  their direction. As a desk its day was past; it had become a series of holes
  roughly held together by fragments of wood.</p>

  <p>So much Drummond could see by the aid of his torch. With the explosion all
  the lights had gone out, and for a while he lay pressed against Ted
  Jerningham trying to recover his wits. His head was singing like a bursting
  kettle: his back felt as if it was broken where a vast lump of ceiling had
  hit him. But after moving his legs cautiously and then his arms, he decided
  that he was still alive. And having arrived at that momentous conclusion the
  necessity for prompt action became evident. A bomb bursting in London is not
  exactly a private affair.</p>

  <p>"Are you all right, Ted?" he muttered hoarsely, his mouth full of plaster
  and dust.</p>

  <p>"I think so, old man," answered Jerningham, and Drummond heaved a sigh of
  relief. "I got a whack on the back of the head from something."</p>

  <p>Drummond scrambled to his feet, and switched on his torch. The wreckage
  was complete, but it was for the third member of the party that he was
  looking. And after a moment or two he found him, and cursed with a vigorous
  fury that boded ill for the person who had thrown the bomb, if he ever met
  him.</p>

  <p>For Ginger Martin, being either too frightened or too ignorant, had not
  done as he was told. There had been no desk between him and the bomb when it
  burst, and what was left of him adorned a corner. There was nothing to be
  done: the unfortunate crook would never again burgle a safe. And the only
  comfort to Drummond was that death must have been absolutely
  instantaneous.</p>

  <p>"Poor devil," he muttered. "Someone is going to pay for this."</p>

  <p>And then he felt Ted Jerningham clutching his arm.</p>

  <p>"It's blown a hole in the wall, man. Look."</p>

  <p>It was true: he could see the light of a street lamp shining through a
  great jagged hole.</p>

  <p>"Some bomb," he muttered. "Let's clear."</p>

  <p>He gave a final flash of his torch round the floor, as they moved towards
  the shattered wall, and then suddenly stopped.</p>

  <p>"What's that?"</p>

  <p>Right in the centre of the beam, lying in the middle of the floor, was a
  small chamois-leather bag. It seemed unhurt, and, without thinking, Hugh
  picked it up and put it in his pocket. Then, switching off the torch, they
  both clambered through the hole, dropped on to a lean-to roof, and reached
  the ground.</p>

  <p>They were at the back of the house in some deserted mews, and rapidity of
  movement was dearly indicated. Already a crowd was hurrying to the scene of
  the explosion, and slipping quietly out of the dark alley, they joined in
  themselves.</p>

  <p>"Go home, Ted," said Drummond. "I must get the others."</p>

  <p>"Right, old man." He made no demur, but just vanished quietly, while his
  leader slouched on towards the front door of Number 5, Green Street. The
  police were already beating on it, while a large knot of interested
  spectators giving gratuitous advice stood around them. And in the crowd
  Drummond could see six of his gang: six anxious men who had
  determined&mdash;police or no police&mdash;to get upstairs and see what had
  happened. In one and all their minds was a sickening fear, that the man they
  followed had at last bitten off more than he could chew&mdash;that they'd
  find him blown to pieces in the mysterious room upstairs.</p>

  <p>And then, quite clear and distinct above the excited comments of the
  crowd, came the hooting of an owl. A strange sound to hear in a London
  street, but no one paid any attention. Other more engrossing matters were on
  hand, more engrossing that is to all except the six men who instantaneously
  swung half round as they heard it. For just a second they had a glimpse of a
  huge figure standing in the light of a lamp-post on the other side of the
  street&mdash;then it disappeared. And with astonishing celerity they followed
  its example. Whoever had been hurt it was not Drummond; and that, at the
  moment, was all they were concerned with.</p>

  <p>By devious routes they left the scene of the explosion&mdash;each with the
  same goal in his mind. The owl had only hooted once, which meant that they
  were to reassemble as soon as possible: the second call, which meant
  disperse, had not been given. And so within an hour six young men, shorn of
  all disguise and clad in immaculate evening clothes, were admitted to
  Drummond's house in Brook Street by a somewhat sleepy Denny.</p>

  <p>They found Hugh arrayed in a gorgeous dressing-gown with a large tankard
  of beer beside him, and his wife sitting on the arm of his chair.</p>

  <p>"Beer, souls," he grunted. "In the corner, as usual."</p>

  <p>"What happened, old lad?" asked Peter Darrell.</p>

  <p>"I got handed the frozen mitten. I asked for bread, and they put across a
  half-brick. To be absolutely accurate we got into the room all right, and
  having got in we found we couldn't get out. Then someone switched on the
  light, and bunged a bomb at us through a hole in the door. Quite O.K., old
  girl "&mdash;he put a reassuring arm round Phyllis's waist&mdash;"I think
  we'd be still there if they hadn't."</p>

  <p>"Is Ted all right?" asked Toby Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Ted's all right. Got a young load of bricks in his back when the
  ceiling came down&mdash;but he's all right. It's the other poor
  devil&mdash;Ginger Martin." His face was grim and stern, and the others
  waited in silence for him to continue.</p>

  <p>"There was a big desk in the room, and the bomb fell on one side of it.
  Ted and I gave our well-known impersonation of an earthworm on the other,
  which saved us. Unfortunately, Ginger Martin elected to run round in small
  circles and curse. And he will curse no more."</p>

  <p>"Dead?" Peter Darrell's voice was low.</p>

  <p>"Very," answered Drummond quietly. "In fact, he's now giving his well-
  known impersonation of a wallpaper. The poor blighter was blown to pieces. If
  he'd done what I told him he wouldn't have been, but that's beside the point.
  He was working for me, and he was killed while he was doing so. And I don't
  like that happening."</p>

  <p>"Oh! my dear," said Phyllis. "I do wish you'd give it up. You've escaped
  this time, but sooner or later they'll get you. It isn't worth it."</p>

  <p>Drummond shook his head, and again encircled his wife's waist with his
  arm.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't like me to let that poor devil's death go unavenged, would
  you?" He looked up at her, and she shrugged her shoulders resignedly. A year
  of marriage with this vast husband of hers had convinced her of the futility
  of arguing with him once his mind was made up. "Not that the country will be
  appreciably worse off for his departure, but that's not the point. He was
  doing a job for me when it happened, and I don't stand for that at all."</p>

  <p>"What do you propose to do?" demanded Jerry Seymour, thoughtfully
  refilling his glass.</p>

  <p>"Well, there, old son, at the moment you have me beat," conceded Hugh. "I
  sort of figured it out this way. Whoever the bird is who bunged that bomb, he
  recognised me as being the leader of our little bunch. I mean it was me he
  was staring at through the door, with eyes bubbling over with tenderness and
  love. It was me that bally bomb was intended for&mdash;not Ginger Martin,
  though he was actually doing the work. And if this cove is prepared to wreck
  his own office just to get me out of the way&mdash;I guess I must be somewhat
  unpopular."</p>

  <p>"The reasoning seems extraordinary profound," murmured Peter.</p>

  <p>"Now the great point is&mdash;does he know who I am?" continued Hugh. "Is
  the little treasure now saying to himself, what time he lowers the evening
  cup of bread-and-milk, 'That has settled the hash of one Hugh Drummond,' or
  is he merely saying, 'I have nastily disintegrated the leader of the Black
  Gang'?"</p>

  <p>"But what's it matter anyway?" demanded Toby. "He hasn't disintegrated
  you, and he's smashed up his own office&mdash;so I fail to see where he wins
  the grand piano."</p>

  <p>"That, old Toby, is where you show yourself incapable of grasping the
  finer points of the situation." Hugh thoughtfully lit a cigarette. "Our great
  difficulty before Zaboleff was kind enough to present us with the address of
  their headquarters was to get in touch with the man at the top. And now the
  headquarters are no more. No man can work in an office with periodical
  boulders falling on his head from the roof, and a large hole in the wall just
  behind him. I mean there's no privacy about it. And so&mdash;unless he knows
  me&mdash;he won't be able to carry on the good work when he finds that
  neither of my boots has reached the top of St. Paul's. We shall be parted
  again&mdash;which is dreadful to think of. There's no cheery little meeting-
  ground where we can foregather for the matutinal Martini or even Manhattan.
  Why, we might even pass one another in the street as complete strangers."</p>

  <p>"I get you," said Peter. "And you don't know him."</p>

  <p>"Not well enough to call him Bertie. There's a humpbacked blighter up
  there who calls himself a Count, and on whom I focused the old optic for
  about two seconds the other evening. But whether he's the humorist who bunged
  the bomb or not is a different matter." He glanced up as the door opened.
  "What is it, Denny?"</p>

  <p>"I found this bag, sir, in the pocket of the coat you were wearing to-
  night."</p>

  <p>His servant came into the room carrying the chamois-leather bag, which he
  handed to Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Will you be wanting anything more to-night, sir?"</p>

  <p>"No, thank you, Denny. You toddle off to bye-bye. And give Mrs. Denny a
  chaste salute from Mr. Darrell."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir!"</p>

  <p>The door closed behind him, and Hugh stared thoughtfully at the bag in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"I'd forgotten about this. Saw it lying on the floor, just before we
  hopped it. Hullo! it's sealed."</p>

  <p>"For goodness' sake be careful, boy!" cried Phyllis. "It may be another
  bomb."</p>

  <p>Hugh laughed and ripped open the bag; then his eyes slowly widened in
  amazement as he saw the contents.</p>

  <p>"Great Scott!" he cried. "What the devil have we got here?"</p>

  <p>He emptied the bag out on to the table, and for a moment or two the others
  stared silently at half a dozen objects that flashed and glittered with a
  thousand fires. Five of them were white; but the sixth&mdash;appreciably
  larger than the others, and they were the size of walnuts&mdash;was a
  wonderful rose pink.</p>

  <p>"What on earth are they? Lumps of glass?"</p>

  <p>With a hand that shook a little, Toby Sinclair picked one of them up and
  examined it.</p>

  <p>"No, you fellows," he muttered, "they're diamonds!"</p>

  <p>"Rot!" cried Hugh incredulously.</p>

  <p>"They're diamonds," repeated Toby. "I happen to know something about
  precious stones. These are diamonds."</p>

  <p>"But they must be worth a lot," said Phyllis, picking up the pink one.</p>

  <p>"Worth a lot," said Toby dazedly. "Worth a lot! Why, Mrs. Hugh, they are
  literally worth untold gold in the right market. They are absolutely
  priceless. I've never even thought of such stones. That one that you're
  holding in your hand would be worth over a quarter of a million pounds, if
  you could get the right buyer."</p>

  <p>For a moment no one spoke; then Hugh laughed cheerily.</p>

  <p>"Bang goes next month's dress allowance, old thing!" He swept them all
  into the bag, and stood up. "I'm laying even money that the bomb-thrower is
  coughing some and then again over his bread-and-milk. This bag must have been
  in the desk." His shoulders began to shake. "How frightfully funny!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap9"
     name="chap9">IX. &mdash; IN WHICH THERE IS A<br>
  STORMY SUPPER PARTY AT THE RITZ</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was just about the time that Ginger Martin's wife became,
  all unconsciously, a widow, that the sitting-room bell of a certain private
  suite in the Ritz was rung. The occupants of the room were two in
  number&mdash;a man and a woman&mdash;and they had arrived only that morning
  from the Continent. The man, whose signature in the register announced him to
  be the Reverend Theodosius Longmoor&mdash;looked a splendid specimen of the
  right sort of clergyman. Tall, broad-shouldered, with a pair of shrewd,
  kindly eyes and a great mass of snow-white hair, he was the type of man who
  attracted attention wherever he went, and in whatever society he found
  himself. A faint twang in his speech betrayed his nationality, and, indeed,
  he made no secret of it. He was an American born and bred, who had been
  seeing first hand for himself some of the dreadful horrors of the famine
  which was ravaging Central Europe.</p>

  <p>And with him had gone his daughter Janet&mdash;that faithful, constant
  companion of his, who since her mother's death had never left him. She was a
  good-looking girl, too&mdash;though perhaps unkind people might have said
  girlhood's happy days had receded somewhat into the past. Thirty,
  perhaps&mdash;even thirty-five&mdash;though her father always alluded to her
  as "My little girl."</p>

  <p>There was something very sweet and touching about their relationship; his
  pride in her and her simple, loving adoration for Dad. Only that evening
  before dinner they had got into conversation in the lounge with a party of
  American globe-trotters, who had unanimously voted them quite charming.</p>

  <p>"I feel," had said the Reverend Theodosius, "that it is almost wicked our
  staying in such an hotel as this, after the dreadful things we've seen. How
  my little girl stood it at all I don't know." He took his daughter's hand and
  patted it lovingly.</p>

  <p>"I guess," said Janet with her faint, sweet smile. "I guess the Dad
  deserves it. Why he nearly worked himself ill doing relief work and things
  out there in Vienna and places."</p>

  <p>"Is there any lack of funds, Mr. Longmoor?" asked one lady. "One feels one
  ought to do something to help."</p>

  <p>The Reverend Theodosius gave her one of his rare sweet smiles.</p>

  <p>"There was when I left," he murmured. "You'd never believe how money goes
  out there, and really the poor children have very little to show for it."</p>

  <p>"Too bad&mdash;too bad." A square-jawed man who was a member of the party
  beckoned to a passing waiter. "Say, Mr. Longmoor, will you drink a cocktail
  with me? And your daughter, too?"</p>

  <p>"It is very good of you, sir," answered the clergyman, with a courteous
  bow. "My little girl has never even tasted one and I think perhaps she had
  better not. What do you think, my child?"</p>

  <p>"I'd love to try. Daddy, dear," she said coaxingly. "Do you think I might?
  Or would it make my head go funny?"</p>

  <p>They all laughed.</p>

  <p>"That settles it. Miss Longmoor," cried the man. "I've ordered one for
  you, and if you don't drink it your father will have to drink two."</p>

  <p>Undoubtedly a charming couple had been the verdict of these chance
  acquaintances&mdash;so simple, so fresh, so unassuming in these days of
  complexity and double-dealing. The only pity of it was, as the square-jawed
  man remarked to his wife at dinner, that the very quality of child-like
  simplicity which made them so charming was the one which laid them open to
  the most barefaced swindling if they ever came up against blackguards.</p>

  <p>After dinner they had all drunk coffee together, and then, because his
  little Janet was tired, the Reverend Theodore and his daughter had retired
  after accepting an invitation to dinner the next day.</p>

  <p>"Who are they?" asked Janet, as they entered their sitting-room.</p>

  <p>"That square-jawed man is John Pendel," answered her father, thoughtfully
  lighting a cigar. "Worth about three million. He's good for dining with,
  though I'm not over here on any sideshows."</p>

  <p>And then for two hours until he got up and rang the bell, the Reverend
  Theodosius remained engrossed in work; while his little Janet, lying on the
  sofa, displayed considerably more leg than one would have expected a vicar's
  daughter even to possess. And occasional gurgles of laughter seemed to prove
  that Guy de Maupassant appeals to a more catholic audience than he would have
  suspected.</p>

  <p>She was knitting decorously when the waiter came in, and her father
  ordered a little supper to be sent up.</p>

  <p>"Some chicken, please, and a little foie gras. I am expecting a friend
  very soon&mdash;so lay for three. Some champagne&mdash;yes. Perrier Jouet '04
  will do. I'm afraid I don't know much about wine. And a little Vichy water
  for my daughter."</p>

  <p>The waiter withdrew, and the Reverend Theodosius chuckled.</p>

  <p>"There's a very good bath you can empty it down, my dear," he said. "But I
  don't think my little Janet should drink champagne so late. It might make her
  head go funny."</p>

  <p>She smiled and then grew serious.</p>

  <p>"What time do you expect Zadowa?"</p>

  <p>"He should have been here by now. I don't know why he's late."</p>

  <p>"Did you see him this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"No. I was down at the office, but only for a short while." The sound of
  voices outside the door caused Janet to resume her knitting, and the next
  moment Count Zadowa was announced. For an appreciable time after the waiter
  had withdrawn he stood staring at them: then a smile crossed his face.</p>

  <p>"Magnificent," he murmured. "Superb. Madame, I felicitate you. Well though
  I know your powers, this time you have excelled yourself."</p>

  <p>"Cut that out, and get to business," returned little Janet shortly, "I'm
  tired."</p>

  <p>"But should we be interrupted," remarked the Reverend Theodosius, "we have
  just returned from an extensive tour in the famine-stricken area round
  Vienna." The Count bowed and smiled again.</p>

  <p>"C'est entendu," he said quietly. "And now we will certainly get to
  business. For I have the most wonderful news for you, mes amis."</p>

  <p>A warning gesture from the girl announced the arrival of supper, and for a
  while the conversation turned on the rival merits of different types of soup
  kitchen. And it was not until the outer door finally closed behind the waiter
  that the Reverend Theodosius bit the end off another cigar and stared at his
  visitor with eyes from which every trace of kindliness had vanished.</p>

  <p>"It's about time you did have some good news, Zadowa," he snapped.
  "Anything more damned disgraceful than the way you've let this
  so&mdash;called Black Gang do you in, I've never heard of."</p>

  <p>But the other merely smiled quietly.</p>

  <p>"I admit it," he murmured. "Up to date they have scored a faint measure of
  success&mdash;exaggerated, my friends, greatly exaggerated by the papers. To-
  night came the reckoning, which incidentally is the reason why I am a little
  late. To-night "&mdash;he leaned forward impressively&mdash;"the leader of
  the gang himself honoured me with a visit. And the leader will lead no
  more."</p>

  <p>"You killed him," said the girl, helping herself to champagne.</p>

  <p>"I did," answered the Count. "And without the leader I think we can ignore
  the gang."</p>

  <p>"That's all right as far as it goes," said the Reverend Theodosius in a
  slightly mollified tone. "But have you covered all your traces? In this
  country the police get peevish over murder."</p>

  <p>The Count gave a self-satisfied smile. "Not only that," he remarked, "but
  I have made it appear as if he had killed himself. Listen, my friends, and I
  will give you a brief statement of the events of the past few days. It was
  the day before the affair at Sheffield which caused such a commotion in the
  papers that I suddenly found out that the leader of this gang had discovered
  my headquarters in Hoxton. I was actually talking to that wretched man Latter
  in my office at the time, when I heard outside the call of an owl. Now from
  information I had received, that was the rallying call of their gang, and I
  dashed into the passage. Sure enough, standing by the door at the end was a
  huge man covered from head to foot in black. Whether it was bravado that made
  him give the cry, or whether it was a ruse to enable him to see me, is
  immaterial now. As I say&mdash;he is dead. But&mdash;and this is the
  point&mdash;it made me decide that the office there, convenient though it
  was, would have to be given up. There were far too many incriminating
  documents to allow me to run the risk of a police raid; and since I frankly
  admit now that I was not at all sure what were the relations between this
  gang and the police, I decided to move my headquarters."</p>

  <p>Count Zadowa helped himself to a sandwich before continuing, with a
  pleasant feeling that the motionless attention of the Reverend Theodosius was
  a compliment to his powers as a raconteur. And as the hunchback reflected
  complacently, there was no falling off in this story&mdash;no anticlimax.</p>

  <p>"To-night," he continued, sipping his glass, "I was completing the final
  sorting out of my papers with my secretary, when the electric warning disc on
  my desk glowed red. Now the office was empty, and the red light meant that
  someone had opened the door outside. I heard nothing, which only made it all
  the more suspicious. So between us we gathered up every important paper,
  switched off all lights, and went out through the secret door. Then we
  waited."</p>

  <p>He turned to the clergyman, still motionless save for a ceaseless tapping
  of his left knee with his hand.</p>

  <p>"As you know, monsieur," he proceeded, "there is an opening in that door
  through which one can see into the room. And through that opening I watched
  developments. After a while a torch was switched on at the farther door, and
  I heard voices. And then the man holding the torch came cautiously in. He was
  turning it into every corner, but finally he focused it on the desk. I heard
  him speak to one of his companions, who came into the beam of light and
  started to pick the lock. And it was then that I switched on every light, and
  closed the door electrically. They were caught&mdash;caught like rats in a
  trap."</p>

  <p>The hunchback paused dramatically, and drained his champagne. If he was
  expecting any laudatory remarks on the part of his audience he was
  disappointed. But the Reverend Theodosius and his little Janet might have
  been carved out of marble, save for that ceaseless tapping by the man of his
  left knee. In fact, had Count Zadowa been less pleased with himself and less
  sure of the effect he was about to cause he might have had a premonition of
  coming danger. There was something almost terrifying in the big clergyman's
  immobility.</p>

  <p>"Like rats in a trap," repeated the hunchback gloatingly. "Two men I
  didn't know, and&mdash;well, you know who the other was. True he had his mask
  on by way of disguise, but I recognised him at once. That huge figure
  couldn't be mistaken&mdash;it was the leader of the Black Gang himself."</p>

  <p>"And what did you do, Zadowa?" The Reverend Theodosius's voice was very
  soft. "How did you dispose of one or all those men so that no suspicion is
  likely to rest on you?"</p>

  <p>The hunchback rubbed his hands together gleefully.</p>

  <p>"By an act which, I think you will agree, is very nearly worthy of
  yourself, monsieur. To shoot was impossible&mdash;because I am not
  sufficiently expert with a revolver to be sure of killing them.
  No&mdash;nothing so ordinary as that. They saw me watching them: 'I can see
  his eyes, Hugh,' said one of them to the leader, and I remember suddenly that
  in the passage not far from where I stood were half a dozen bombs&mdash;What
  is it, monsieur?"</p>

  <p>He paused in alarm at the look on the clergyman's face as he slowly
  rose.</p>

  <p>"Bombs!" he snarled. "Bombs! Tell me what you did, you dreg!"</p>

  <p>"Why," stammered the frightened hunchback, "I threw one into the room. I
  no longer wanted it as an office, and...Ah, heaven, don't murder me!...What
  have I done?"</p>

  <p>His words died away in a dreadful gurgle, as the clergyman, his face
  diabolical with fury, sprang on him and gripped him by the throat. He shook
  the hunchback as a terrier shakes a rat, cursing horribly under his
  breath&mdash;and for a moment or two it seemed as if the other's fear was
  justified. There was murder in the big man's face, until the touch of the
  girl's hand on his arm steadied him and brought him to his senses. With a
  last spasm of fury he hurled the wretched Zadowa into a corner, and left him
  lying there; then his iron self-control came back to him.</p>

  <p>"Get up," he ordered tensely, "and answer some questions."</p>

  <p>Trembling all over, the hunchback staggered to his feet, and came into the
  centre of the room. "Monsieur," he whined, "I do not understand. What have I
  done?"</p>

  <p>"You don't need to understand!" snarled the clergyman. "Tell me exactly
  what happened when the bomb burst."</p>

  <p>"It killed the three men, monsieur," stammered the other.</p>

  <p>"Curse the three men!" He lifted his clenched fist, and Zadowa shrank
  back. "What happened to the room?"</p>

  <p>"It was wrecked utterly. A great hole was blown in the wall."</p>

  <p>"And what happened to the desk?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know exactly, monsieur," stammered the other. "I didn't go back
  to see. But it must have been blown to matchwood. Only as there was nothing
  inside of importance it makes no odds."</p>

  <p>"Did you look in the secret drawer at the back of the centre opening? You
  didn't know there was one, did you? Only I knew of its existence, and short
  of taking the desk to pieces no one would be able to find it. And you took
  the desk to pieces, Zadowa, didn't you? You blew it to pieces, Zadowa, didn't
  you? Just to kill the leader of this trumpery gang, Zadowa, you cursed
  fool!"</p>

  <p>Step by step the hunchback was retreating before the other, terror
  convulsing his face, until the wall brought him to an abrupt stop.</p>

  <p>"You blew the desk to pieces, Zadowa," continued the Reverend Theodosius,
  standing in front of him, "a desk that contained the six most perfect
  diamonds in the world, Zadowa. With your wretched bomb, you worm, you
  destroyed a fortune. What have you got to say?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't know, monsieur," cringed the other. "How could I know? When were
  they put there?"</p>

  <p>"I put them there this afternoon for safety. Not in my wildest imagination
  did I dream that you would start throwing bombs about the place."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps they are not destroyed," stammered the hunchback hopefully.</p>

  <p>"In which case they are now in the hands of the police. You have one
  chance, Zadowa, and only one. It is that those diamonds are in the hands of
  the police. If they are and you can get them&mdash;I will say no more."</p>

  <p>"But if they have been destroyed, monsieur?" muttered the other.</p>

  <p>"Then, Zadowa, I am afraid you will share their fate."</p>

  <p>Almost indifferently the clergyman turned back into the room, taking no
  notice whatever of the wretched man who followed him on his knees begging for
  mercy. And then after a while the hunchback pulled himself together and stood
  up.</p>

  <p>"It was a mistake, monsieur," he said quietly, "which I deeply regret. It
  was, however, you must admit, hardly my fault. I will do my best."</p>

  <p>"Let us hope, then, for your sake, Zadowa, that your best will be
  successful. Now go."</p>

  <p>He pointed to the door, and without another word the hunchback went.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you were here to-night, my dear," remarked the Reverend
  Theodosius. "I don't often lose my temper, but I very nearly killed that man
  this evening." The girl rose and came over to where he was standing.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand, mon cheri," she said quietly. "What diamonds are
  these you talk about?"</p>

  <p>The man gave a short, hard laugh.</p>

  <p>"I didn't tell you," he answered. "There was no object in your knowing for
  a time. I know your weakness where jewels are concerned too well, my dear; I
  got them the night before last in Amsterdam. Do you remember that
  Russian&mdash;Stanovitch? That wasn't his real name. He was the eldest son of
  the Grand Duke Georgius, and he had just arrived from Russia."</p>

  <p>"The man who took that overdose of his sleeping-draught?" whispered the
  girl barely above her breath.</p>

  <p>The Reverend Theodosius smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"So they decided," he remarked. "He confided in me the night before he
  came to his sad end what he had been doing in Russia. His father had hidden
  the family heirlooms from the Bolshevists, and our young friend went over to
  retrieve them. Most ingenious&mdash;the way he got them out of Russia. Such a
  pity he had a lapse with his sleep dope."</p>

  <p>And now the Reverend Theodosius was snarling like a mad dog.</p>

  <p>"By heavens, girl&mdash;do you wonder that I nearly killed that fool
  Zadowa? The coup of a lifetime&mdash;safely brought off. Not a trace of
  suspicion on me&mdash;not a trace. I know I said I wasn't over here on side-
  shows, but I couldn't have been expected to let such a chance slip by. And
  then, after having got them safely into his country to lose them like that.
  Why, do you know that one of them was the rose diamond of the Russian Crown
  jewels?"</p>

  <p>The girl's eyes glistened, then she shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"They would have been unsaleable, mon ami," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>"Don't you believe it," snapped the other. "There are markets for anything
  in the world, if one takes the trouble to look for them."</p>

  <p>He was pacing up and down the room, and for a while she stood watching him
  in silence.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad I didn't know about them till now," she said at length. "I might
  not have stopped you killing him, if I had. And it would have been rather
  awkward."</p>

  <p>He gave a short laugh, and threw the end of his cigar into the grate.</p>

  <p>"No good crying over spilt milk, my dear. Let's go to bed."</p>

  <p>But little Janet still stood by the table watching him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"What are you thinking about?"</p>

  <p>"I was thinking about a rather peculiar coincidence," she answered
  quietly. "You were too worried over the diamonds to notice it&mdash;but it
  struck me instantly. The leader of this gang&mdash;this huge man whom Zadowa
  killed to-night. Did you notice what his Christian name was?"</p>

  <p>The Reverend Theodosius shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It was Hugh&mdash;Zadowa heard one of the others call him by name. Hugh,
  mon ami; Hugh&mdash;and a huge man. A coincidence, I think."</p>

  <p>The man gave a short laugh. "A very long one, my dear. Too long to bother
  about."</p>

  <p>"It would be a pity if he was dead," she went on thoughtfully. "I would
  have liked to see my Hugh Drummond again."</p>

  <p>"If he has been killed, if your supposition is correct," returned the man,
  "it will do something towards reconciling me to the loss of the diamonds. But
  I don't think it's likely. And incidentally he is the only side-show I am
  going to allow myself during this trip."</p>

  <p>Little Janet laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," she said, "I wonder. Let us, as you say, go to bed."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">X. &mdash; IN WHICH HUGH DRUMMOND MAKES A DISCOVERY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The prospect in front of Count Zadowa alias Mr. Atkinson was
  not a very alluring one, and the more he thought about it the less he liked
  it. Either the diamonds were blown to dust, or they were in the hands of the
  authorities. In the first event he had the Reverend Theodosius to reckon
  with; in the second the police. And for preference the police won in a
  canter.</p>

  <p>He was under no delusions was the hunchback. This mysterious man who
  signed all his communications by the enigmatic letter X, and whose real
  appearance was known probably only to the girl who was his constant
  companion, so wonderful and varied were his disguises, was not a person whom
  it paid to have any delusions about He paid magnificently, even lavishly, for
  work well done: for failure he took no excuse. Even long association did not
  mitigate the offence. With a shudder Count Zadowa remembered the fate of
  certain men he had known in the past, men who had been employed, even as he
  was now employed, on one of the innumerable schemes of their chief. No
  project, from the restoration of a monarchy to the downfall of a business
  combine, was too great for the man who now called himself the Reverend
  Theodosius Longmoor. All that mattered was that there should be money in it.
  Why he should be interesting himself in the spread of Communism in England it
  was not for Count Zadowa to inquire, even though he was the head of that
  particular activity. Presumably he was being paid for it by others; it was no
  business of Count Zadowa's.</p>

  <p>And as he undressed that night in the quiet hotel in Bloomsbury where he
  lived the hunchback cursed bitterly under his breath. It was such a cruel
  stroke of luck. How much he had dreaded that first interview with his chief
  he had hardly admitted even to himself. And then had come the heaven-sent
  opportunity of killing the leader of the Black Gang in perfect safety; of
  making it appear that the three men inside the room, and who had no business
  to be inside the room, had blown themselves up by mistake. How was he to know
  about the diamonds: how could he possibly be expected to know? And once again
  he cursed, while the sweat glistened on his forehead as he realised his
  predicament.</p>

  <p>He had already decided that his only method lay in going down to the
  office next morning as usual. He would find it, of course, in the possession
  of the police, and would be told what had happened. And then he would have to
  trust to luck to discover what he could. Perhaps&mdash;and at the thought of
  it he almost started to dress again&mdash;perhaps the desk was not utterly
  ruined. Perhaps the diamonds were there, even now, in the secret drawer. And
  then he realised that if he went to his office at two o'clock in the morning,
  it must look suspicious. No; waiting was the only possibility, and Count
  Zadowa waited. He even went so far as to get into bed, but Count Zadowa did
  not sleep.</p>

  <p>Punctually at half-past nine the next morning he arrived at 5, Green
  Street. As he had expected, a constable was standing at the door.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, sir?" The policeman was barring his entrance.</p>

  <p>"My name is Atkinson," said the Count, with well-feigned surprise. "May I
  ask what you're doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Haven't you heard, sir?" said the constable. "There was a bomb outrage
  here last night. In your office upstairs."</p>

  <p>"A bomb outrage?" Mr. Atkinson gazed at the constable in amazement, and a
  loafer standing by began to laugh.</p>

  <p>"Not 'arf, guv'nor," he remarked cheerfully. "The 'ole ruddy place is gone
  to blazes."</p>

  <p>"You dry up," admonished the policeman. "Move along, can't you?"</p>

  <p>"Orl rite, orl rite," grumbled the other, shambling off. "Not allowed to
  live soon, we won't be."</p>

  <p>"You'd better go up, sir," continued the constable. "The Inspector is
  upstairs."</p>

  <p>Mr. Atkinson needed no second invitation. Taking no notice of the half-
  dozen clerks who had gathered in a little group discussing the affair, he
  passed along the passage into his own room. And the scene that met his eyes
  reflected credit on the manufacturer of the bomb. Viewed by the light of day
  which came streaming in through the great hole in the wall the ruin was
  complete. In the centre&mdash;and it was there Mr. Atkinson's eyes strayed
  continuously even while he was acknowledging the greetings of the
  Inspector&mdash;stood the remnants of the desk. And as he looked at it any
  faint hope he may have cherished vanished completely. It was literally split
  to pieces in every direction; there was not left a hiding-place for a pea,
  much less a bag of diamonds.</p>

  <p>"Not much in the office, sir, which was lucky for you."</p>

  <p>The Inspector was speaking and Mr. Atkinson pulled himself together. He
  had a part to play, and whatever happened no suspicions must be aroused.</p>

  <p>"I feel quite staggered, Inspector." His glance travelled to a sinister-
  looking heap in the corner&mdash;a heap roughly covered with an old rug. The
  wall above it was stained a dull red, and from under the rug stretched out
  two long streams of the same colour&mdash;streams which were not yet dry.</p>

  <p>"What on earth has happened?"</p>

  <p>"There seems very little doubt about that, sir," remarked the Inspector.
  "I have reconstructed the whole thing with the help of your clerk here, Mr.
  Cohen. It appears that last night about twelve o'clock three men entered your
  office downstairs. They bound and gagged Cohen&mdash;and then they came on up
  here. Evidently their idea was burglary. What happened, then, of course, it
  is hard to say exactly. Presumably they started using explosive to force your
  safe, and explosive is funny stuff even for the expert."</p>

  <p>The Inspector waved a hand at the heap in the corner.</p>

  <p>"And he&mdash;poor devil, was quite an expert in his way. One of the three
  men, Mr. Atkinson&mdash;or what's left of him. Ginger Martin&mdash;an old
  friend of mine."</p>

  <p>For a moment Mr. Atkinson's heart stood still. One of the three men! Then,
  where in Heaven's name, were the other two?</p>

  <p>"One of the three. Inspector," he said at length, steadying his voice.
  "But what happened to the others?"</p>

  <p>"That is the amazing thing, sir," answered the Inspector. "I can but think
  that though three men entered the office downstairs, only Martin can have
  been in here at the time of the explosion." He pulled back the bloodstained
  rug, and with a shudder Mr. Atkinson contemplated what was underneath. He
  recognised the face, sure enough it was the man who had run round the room
  when he found himself trapped. But there was no trace of anyone else. The
  mangled remnants had formed one man and one man only. Then what, he reflected
  again&mdash;what had become of the other two? He knew they had been in there
  at the time of the explosion, and as he vaguely listened to the Inspector's
  voice his mind was busy with this new development.</p>

  <p>They had been in there&mdash;the leader of the Black Gang and one of his
  pals. There was no trace of them now. Wherefore, somehow, by some miraculous
  means they must have escaped, and the soul of Count Zadowa grew sick within
  him. Not only had the whole thing been useless and unnecessary, not only had
  he incurred the wrath of his own leader, and unwelcome attention from the
  police, but, in addition, this mysterious being whom he had thought to kill
  was not dead but very much alive. He had two people up against him now, and
  he wasn't quite sure which of the two he feared most.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he became aware that the Inspector was asking him a question.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes," he said, pulling himself together, "that is so. I was leaving
  this office here, and had removed almost everything of value. Only some
  diamonds were left. Inspector&mdash;and they were in that desk. I have
  somewhat extensive dealings in precious stones. Was there any trace of them
  found?"</p>

  <p>The Inspector laughed grimly. "You see the room for yourself, sir. But
  that perhaps supplies us with the motive for the crime. I am afraid your
  diamonds are either blown to pieces, or in the hands of the other two men,
  whom I have every hope of laying my hands on shortly. There is no trace of
  them here."</p>

  <p>In the hands of the other two men! The idea was a new one which had not
  yet come into his calculations, so convinced had he been that all three men
  were dead. And suddenly he felt a sort of blinding certainty that the
  Inspector&mdash;though in ignorance of the real facts of the case&mdash;was
  right in his surmise. Diamonds are not blown to pieces by an explosion;
  scattered they might be&mdash;disintegrated, no. He felt he must get away to
  consider this new development. Where did he stand if the diamonds were indeed
  in the possession of the Black Gang? Would it help him or would it not, with
  regard to that implacable man at the Ritz?</p>

  <p>He crossed over to the jagged hole in the wall and looked out.</p>

  <p>"This has rather upset me. Inspector," he said, after a while. "The South
  Surrey Hotel in Bloomsbury will always find me."</p>

  <p>"Right, sir!" The Inspector made a note, and then leaned out through the
  hole, with a frown. "Get out of this, you there! Go on, or I'll have you
  locked up as a vagrant!"</p>

  <p>"Orl rite, orl rite! Can't a bloke 'ave a bit o' fun when 'e ain't doing
  no 'arm?"</p>

  <p>The loafer, who had been ignominiously moved on from the front door,
  scrambled down from the lean-to roof behind, and slouched away, muttering
  darkly. And he was still muttering to himself as he opened the door of a taxi
  a few minutes later, into which Mr. Atkinson hurried stepped. For a moment or
  two he stood on the pavement until it had disappeared from view; then his
  prowling propensities seemed to disappear as if by magic. Still with the same
  shambling gait, but apparently now with some definite object in his mind, he
  disappeared down a side street, finally coming to a halt before a public
  telephone-box. He gave one rapid look round, then he stepped inside.</p>

  <p>"Mayfair 12345." He waited, beating a tattoo with his pennies on the box.
  Things had gone well that morning&mdash;very well.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, is that you, Hugh? Yes, Peter speaking. The man Atkinson is the
  hunchback. Stopping South Surrey Hotel, Bloomsbury. He's just got into a taxi
  and gone off to the Ritz. He seemed peeved to me...Yes, he inquired lovingly
  about the whatnots...What's that? You'll toddle round to the Ritz yourself.
  Right ho! I'll come, too. Cocktail time. Give you full details then."</p>

  <p>The loafer stepped out of the box and shut the door. Then, still sucking a
  filthy clay pipe, he shambled off in the direction of the nearest Tube
  station. A slight change of attire before lining up at the Ritz seemed
  indicated.</p>

  <p>And it would, indeed, have been a shrewd observer who would have
  identified the immaculately-dressed young gentleman who strolled into the
  Ritz shortly before twelve o'clock with the dissolute-looking object who had
  so aroused the wrath of the police a few hours previously in Hoxton. The
  first person he saw sprawling contentedly in an easy chair was Hugh Drummond,
  who waved his stick in greeting.</p>

  <p>"Draw up, Peter, old lad," he boomed, "and put your nose inside a
  wet."</p>

  <p>Peter Darrell took the next chair, and his eyes glanced quickly round the
  lounge.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen him, Hugh?" he said, lowering his voice. "I don't see
  anything answering to the bird growing about the place here."</p>

  <p>"No," answered Hugh. "But from discreet inquiries made from old pimply-
  face yonder I find that he arrived here about ten o'clock. He was at once
  shown up to the rooms of a gent calling himself the Reverend Theodosius
  Longmoor, where, as far as I can make out, he has remained ever since.
  Anyway, I haven't seen him trotting up and down the hall, calling to his
  young; nor have either of the beadles at the door reported his departure. So
  here I remain like a bird in the wilderness until the blighter and his padre
  pal break cover. I want to see the Reverend Theodosius Longmoor, Peter."</p>

  <p>A ball of wool rolled to his feet, and Hugh stooped to pick it up. The
  owner was a girl sitting close by, busily engaged in knitting some obscure
  garment, and Hugh handed her the wool with a bow.</p>

  <p>"Thank you so much!" she said, with a pleasant smile. "I'm afraid I'm
  always dropping my wool all over the place."</p>

  <p>"Don't mention it," remarked Hugh politely. "Deuced agile little
  thing&mdash;a ball of wool. Spend my life picking up my wife's. Everybody
  seems to be knitting these jumper effects now."</p>

  <p>"Oh, this isn't a jumper," answered the girl a little sadly. "I've no time
  for such frivolities as that. You see, I've just come back from the famine
  stricken parts of Austria&mdash;and not only are the poor things hungry, but
  they can't get proper clothes. So just a few of us are knitting things for
  them&mdash;stock sizes, you know&mdash;big, medium, and small."</p>

  <p>"How fearfully jolly of you!" said Hugh admiringly. "Dashed sporting thing
  to do. Awful affair, though, when the small size shrinks in the wash. The
  proud proprietor will burst out in all directions. Most disconcerting for all
  concerned."</p>

  <p>The girl blushed faintly and Hugh subsided abashed in his chair.</p>

  <p>"I must tell my wife about it," he murmured in confusion. "She's coming
  here to lunch, and she ought to turn 'em out like bullets from a machine-
  gun&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>The girl smiled faintly as she rose.</p>

  <p>"It would be very good of her if she would help," she remarked gently, and
  then, with a slight bow, she walked away in the direction of the lift.</p>

  <p>"You know, old son," remarked Hugh, as he watched her disappearing, "it's
  an amazing affair when you really come to think of it. There's that girl with
  a face far superior to a patched boot and positively oozing virtue from every
  pore. And yet, would you leave your happy home for her? Look at her
  skirts&mdash;five inches too long; and yet she'd make a man an excellent
  wife. A heart of gold probably, hidden beneath innumerable strata of
  multi-coloured wools."</p>

  <p>Completely exhausted he drained his cocktail, and leaned back in his
  chair, while Peter digested the profound utterance in silence. A slight
  feeling of lassitude was beginning to weigh on him owing to the atrocious
  hour at which he had been compelled to rise, and he felt quite unable to
  contribute any suitable addition to the conversation. Not that it was
  required: the ferocious frown on Drummond's face indicated that he was in the
  throes of thought and might be expected to give tongue in the near
  future.</p>

  <p>"I ought to have a bit of paper to write it all down on, Peter," he
  remarked at length. "I was getting it fairly clear when that sweet maiden put
  me completely in the soup again. In fact, I was just going to run over the
  whole affair with you when I had to start chasing wool all over London. Where
  are we, Peter? That is the question. Point one: we have the
  diamonds&mdash;more by luck than good management. Point two: the hunchback
  gentleman who has a sufficiently strong constitution to live at the South
  Surrey Hotel in Bloomsbury has not got the diamonds. Point three: he, at the
  present moment, is closeted with the Reverend Theodosius Longmoor upstairs.
  Point four: we are about to consume another cocktail downstairs.
  Well&mdash;bearing that little lot in mind, what happens when we all
  meet?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, what!" said Peter, coming out of a short sleep.</p>

  <p>"A policy of masterly inactivity seems indicated," continued Hugh
  thoughtfully. "We may even have to see them eat. But I can't buttonhole
  Snooks, or whatever the blighter's name is, and ask him if he bunged a bomb
  at me last night, can I? It would be so deuced awkward if he hadn't. As I
  said before, a brief survey of the devil-dodger's face might help. And, on
  the other hand, it might not. In fact, it is all very obscure,
  Peter&mdash;very obscure."</p>

  <p>A slight snore was his only answer, and Hugh continued to ponder on the
  obscurity of the situation in silence. That several rays of light might have
  been thrown on it by a conversation then proceeding upstairs was of no help
  to him: nor could he have been expected to know that the fog of war was about
  to lift in a most unpleasantly drastic manner.</p>

  <p>"Coincidence? Bosh!" the girl with the heart of gold was remarking at that
  very moment. "It's a certainty. Whether he's got the diamonds or not, I can't
  say, but your big friend of last night Zadowa, is sitting downstairs now
  drinking a cocktail in the lounge.</p>

  <p>"And your big friend of last night is a gentleman with whom he and I
  "&mdash;she smiled thoughtfully at the Reverend Theodosius&mdash;"have a
  little account to settle."</p>

  <p>"My account is not a little one," said the hunchback viciously.</p>

  <p>"Amazing though it is, it certainly looks as if you were right, my dear,"
  answered her father thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Of course I'm right!" cried the girl. "Why, the darned thing is sticking
  out and barking at you. A big man, Christian name Hugh, was in Zadowa's
  office last night. Hugh Drummond is downstairs at the moment, having actually
  tracked Zadowa here. Of course, they're the same; an infant in arms could see
  it."</p>

  <p>"Granted you're right," said the Reverend Theodosius, "I confess at the
  moment that I am a little doubtful as to how to turn the fact to our
  advantage. The fact is an interesting one, my dear, more than interesting;
  but it don't seem to me to come within the range of practical politics just
  at present."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said the girl. "His wife is coming here to lunch. You remember
  her&mdash;that silly little fool Phyllis Benton? And they live in Brook
  Street. It might be worth trying. If by any chance he has got the
  diamonds&mdash;well, she'll be very useful. And if he hasn't "&mdash;she
  shrugged her shoulders&mdash;"we can easily return her if we don't want
  her."</p>

  <p>The Reverend Theodosius smiled. Long-winded explanations between the two
  of them were seldom necessary. Then he looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Short notice," he remarked; "but we'll try. No harm done if we fail."</p>

  <p>He stepped over to the telephone, and put through a call. And having given
  two or three curt orders he came slowly back into the room.</p>

  <p>"Chances of success very small, I'm afraid; but as you say, my dear, worth
  trying. And now I think I'll renew my acquaintance with Drummond. It would be
  wiser if you had your lunch sent up here, Janet; just for the time our friend
  had better not connect us together in any way. And as for you, Zadowa
  "&mdash;his tone became curt&mdash;"you can go. Let us hope for your sake
  that Drummond has really got them."</p>

  <p>"There's only one point," put in the girl; "his departure will be reported
  at once to Drummond. He's tipped both the men at the doors."</p>

  <p>"Then in that case you'd better stop here," said the Reverend Theodosius.
  "I shall probably come up to lunch, but I might have it in the restaurant. I
  might "&mdash;he paused by the door&mdash;"I might even have it with Drummond
  and his friend."</p>

  <p>With a short chuckle he left the room, and a minute or two later a
  benevolent clergyman, reading the <i>Church Times</i>, was sitting in the
  lounge just opposite Hugh and Peter. Through half-closed eyes Hugh took stock
  of him, wondering casually if this was the Reverend Theodosius Longmoor. If
  so, assuredly nothing more benevolent in the line of sky-pilots could be well
  imagined. And when a few minutes later the clergyman took a cigarette out of
  his case, and then commenced to fumble in his pockets for matches which he
  had evidently forgotten, Hugh rose and offered him one.</p>

  <p>"Allow me, sir," he murmured, holding it out.</p>

  <p>"I thank you, sir," said the clergyman, with a charming smile. "I'm so
  terribly forgetful over matches. As a matter of fact I don't generally smoke
  before lunch, but I've had such a distressing morning that I felt I must have
  a cigarette just to soothe my nerves."</p>

  <p>"By Jove! that's bad," remarked Hugh. "Bath water cold, and all that?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing so trivial, I fear," said the other. "No; a poor man who has been
  with me since ten has just suffered the most terrible blow. I could hardly
  have believed it possible here in London, but the whole of his business
  premises were wrecked by a bomb last night."</p>

  <p>"You don't say so," murmured Hugh, sinking into a chair, and at the table
  opposite Peter Darrell opened one eye.</p>

  <p>"All his papers&mdash;everything&mdash;gone. And it has hit me, too. Quite
  a respectable little sum of money&mdash;over a hundred pounds, gathered
  together for the restoration of the old oak chancel in my church&mdash;blown
  to pieces by this unknown miscreant. It's hard, sir, it's hard. But this poor
  fellow's loss is greater than mine, so I must not complain. To the best of my
  poor ability I have been helping him to bear his misfortune with fortitude
  and strength."</p>

  <p>The clergyman took off his spectacles and wiped them, and Drummond stole a
  lightning glance at Darrell. The faintest shrug of his shoulders indicated
  that the latter had heard, and was as much in the dark as Hugh. That this was
  the Reverend Theodosius Longmoor was now obvious, but what a charming,
  courteous old gentleman! It seemed impossible to associate guilt with such a
  delightful person, and, if so, they had made a bad mistake. It was not the
  hunchback who had thrown the bomb; they were up another blind alley.</p>

  <p>For a while Hugh chatted with him about the outrage, then he glanced at
  his watch.</p>

  <p>"Nearly time for lunch, I think," said the clergyman. "Perhaps you would
  give a lonely old man the pleasure of your company."</p>

  <p>"Very nice of you, but I'm expecting my wife," said Hugh. "She said she'd
  be here at one, and now it's a quarter past. Perhaps you'll lunch with
  us?"</p>

  <p>"Charmed," said the clergyman, taking a note which a pageboy was handing
  to him on a tray. "Charmed." He glanced through the note and placed it in his
  pocket. "The ladies, bless them! so often keep us waiting."</p>

  <p>"I'll just go and ring up," said Drummond. "She may have changed her
  mind."</p>

  <p>"Another prerogative of their sex," beamed his companion, as Drummond left
  him. He polished his spectacles and once more resumed his perusal of the
  Church Times, bowing in old-world fashion to two or three acquaintances who
  passed. And more and more was Peter Darrell becoming convinced that a big
  mistake had been made somewhere, when Hugh returned looking a little
  worried.</p>

  <p>"Can't make it out, Peter," he said anxiously. "Just got through to Denny,
  and Phyllis left half an hour ago to come here."</p>

  <p>"Probably doing a bit of shopping, old man," answered Peter reassuringly.
  "I say, Hugh, we've bloomered over this show."</p>

  <p>Hugh glanced across at the table where the clergyman was sitting, and
  suddenly Peter found his arm gripped with a force that made him cry out. He
  glanced at Hugh, and that worthy was staring at the clergyman with a look of
  speechless amazement on his face. Then he swung round, and his eyes were
  blazing.</p>

  <p>"Peter!" he said tensely. "Look at him. The one trick that gives him away
  every time! Bloomered, have we? Great heavens above, man, it's Carl
  Peterson!"</p>

  <p>A little dazedly Darrell glanced at the clergyman. He was still reading
  the Church Times, but with his left hand he was drumming a ceaseless tattoo
  on his knee.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11">XI. &mdash; IN WHICH HUGH DRUMMOND AND THE REVEREND<br>
  THEODOSIUS LONGMOOR TAKE LUNCH TOGETHER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Rot, Hugh!" Peter turned a little irritably from his coven
  inspection of the Reverend Theodosius Longmoor. "You've got Peterson on the
  brain. Why, that old bird is no more like him than my boot."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, it's Peterson," answered Drummond doggedly. "Don't look at
  him, Peter; don't let him think we're talking about him on any account. I
  admit he bears not the slightest resemblance to our one and only Carl, but
  he's no more unlike him than the Comte de Guy was that time in Paris. It's
  just that one little trick he can never shake off&mdash;that tapping with his
  left hand on his knee&mdash;that made me spot him."</p>

  <p>"Well, granted you're right," conceded Darrell grudgingly, "what do we do
  now, sergeant-major?"</p>

  <p>Drummond lit a cigarette thoughtfully before he replied. Half-hidden by a
  large luncheon party which was just preparing to move into the restaurant, he
  stole another look at the object of their remarks. With an expression of
  intense benevolence the Reverend Theodosius was chatting with an elderly
  lady, and on Drummond's face, as he turned back, was a faint grin of
  admiration. Truly in the matter of disguises the man was a living marvel.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Peter," he answered after a while. "I've got to think this
  out. It's been so sudden that it's got me guessing. I know it's what we've
  been hoping for; it's what we wrote that letter to the paper for&mdash;to
  draw the badger. And by the Lord! we've drawn him, and the badger is
  Peterson. But somehow or other I didn't expect to find him disguised as a
  Mormon missionary residing at the Ritz."</p>

  <p>"You're perfectly certain, Hugh?" said Peter, who was still far from
  convinced.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely, old man," answered Drummond gravely. "The clergyman over
  there is Carl Peterson, late of the Elms, Godalming. And the game has begun
  again."</p>

  <p>Darrell gave a short laugh as he noted the gleam in his leader's eyes.
  "I'm thinking," he remarked soberly, "that this time the game is going to
  make us go all out."</p>

  <p>"So much the better," grinned Hugh. "We'll add him to our collection,
  Peter, and then we'll present the whole damned bunch to the Zoo. And, in the
  meantime, he shall lunch with us when Phyllis arrives, and prattle on
  theology to an appreciative audience. Incidentally it will appeal to his
  sense of humour; there's no difficulty about recognising us."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Peter, "we start one up there. He doesn't know that we've
  spotted him. I wonder where the diamonds come in, Hugh?"</p>

  <p>"Darned intimately, from what I know of the gentleman. But that's only one
  of several little points that require clearing up. And in the next few days,
  Peter, my boy&mdash;we will clear them up."</p>

  <p>"Or be cleared up ourselves," laughed Darrell. "Look out, he's coming
  over."</p>

  <p>They turned as the clergyman crossed the lounge towards them.</p>

  <p>"Jolly old tum-tum beginning to shout for nourishment," said Hugh with an
  affable smile as he joined them. "My wife should be here at any moment now,
  Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Longmoor is my name," said the clergyman, beaming on them. "It is very
  charming of you to take such compassion on a lonely old man."</p>

  <p>"Staying here all by yourself?" asked Drummond politely.</p>

  <p>"No; my daughter is with me. The dear child has been my constant companion
  ever since my beloved wife's death some years ago."</p>

  <p>He polished his glasses, which had become a little misty, and Drummond
  made noises indicative of sympathy.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't believe the comfort she has been to me. In these days, when
  it seems to me that the modern girl thinks of nothing but dancing and
  frivolity, it is indeed a blessing to find one who, while preserving her
  winsome sense of humour, devotes her life to the things that really matter.
  In our recent tour in Austria&mdash;I beg your pardon, you said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," answered Drummond quietly. "You have been to Austria, you
  say?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; we have just returned from a visit to the famine-stricken area,"
  replied the clergyman. "Most interesting&mdash;but most terribly sad. You
  know&mdash;I don't think I caught your name."</p>

  <p>"Drummond, Captain Drummond," answered Hugh mechanically. "And this is Mr.
  Darrell. I think I have had the pleasure of making your daughter's
  acquaintance already. She was manufacturing woollen garments for the
  Austrians down here, and I retrieved an elusive ball of wool for her."</p>

  <p>"That is just my daughter all over, Captain Drummond," beamed the Reverend
  Theodosius. "Never wasting her time, always doing something for the good of
  humanity."</p>

  <p>But at the moment it is to be regretted that Hugh was not worrying his
  head over the good of humanity. Inconceivable though it was, judged on the
  mere matter of appearance, that the Reverend Theodosius was Carl Peterson, it
  was still more inconceivable that the wool-knitter with the heart of gold
  could be Irma. Of course Peterson might have changed his daughter&mdash;but
  if he hadn't, what then? What had he said to Peter Darrell when the girl,
  recognising him all the time, was sitting in the next chair? How much had she
  overheard? And suddenly Hugh began to feel that he was floundering in deep
  waters. How many cards did the other side hold? and, what was even more
  important, how many of his own cards had they placed correctly? And glancing
  up he found the reverend gentleman's blue eyes fixed on him and glinting with
  a certain quizzical humour. Assuredly, reflected Drummond, it was up to him
  to find out, and that as soon as possible, exactly how matters stood. The
  trouble was how to set about it. To greet the Reverend Theodosius as a
  long-lost friend and ask him whether the disguise was donned to amuse the
  children would certainly precipitate affairs, but it would also throw one of
  his best cards on the table. And Carl Peterson was not a gentleman with whom
  it was advisable to weaken one's hand unnecessarily. So it all boiled down to
  a policy of waiting for the other side to play first, which, in view of the
  fact that he was getting distinctly peckish, seemed to Hugh to be an
  eminently sound decision.</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch and turned to Darrell. "Confound the girl, Peter!
  She's nearly forty minutes late."</p>

  <p>"Picked up a pal, old boy," answered that worthy. "Picked up a pal and
  they're masticating a Bath bun somewhere. Why not leave a message at the
  door, and let's get on with it? I'm darned hungry."</p>

  <p>The Reverend Theodosius beamed from behind his spectacles. "'Tis ever the
  same," he murmured gently. "But it is the prerogative of their sex."</p>

  <p>"Well, let's toddle in and take nourishment," said Hugh, taking hold of
  the clergyman's arm with his hand and pushing him towards the restaurant.
  "Jove! Mr. Longmoor&mdash;you've got some pretty useful biceps on you."</p>

  <p>The other smiled as if pleased with the compliment.</p>

  <p>"Nothing to you, Captain Drummond, to judge by your size, but I think I
  may say I'm a match for most men. My ministry has led me into some very rough
  corners, and I have often found that where gentle persuasion fails, force
  will succeed."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," murmured Drummond, gazing at the menu. "Nothing like a good
  one straight on the point of the jaw for producing a devout manner of living
  in the recipient. Often found that out myself. By the way, what about the
  daughter? Isn't she going to honour us?"</p>

  <p>"Not to-day," answered the Reverend Theodosius. "She is lunching upstairs
  with the poor fellow I told you about, whose office was wrecked last night.
  He is sadly in need of comfort."</p>

  <p>"I'll bet he is," agreed Hugh. "But if he put on one of those jolly little
  things she's knitting and trotted up and down Piccadilly he'd soon get all
  the money back for your chancel steps. The man I'm sorry for is the poor
  devil who was found adhering to the wall."</p>

  <p>The Reverend Theodosius glanced at him thoughtfully, and Drummond realised
  he had made a slip.</p>

  <p>"You seem to know quite a lot about it. Captain Drummond," murmured the
  other, dissecting a sardine.</p>

  <p>"It's in the early editions of the evening papers," returned Hugh calmly.
  "Pictures and everything. The only thing they've left out is that reference
  to your little lump of dough."</p>

  <p>"In such a dreadful thing as this, a trifle like that might well he
  overlooked," said the Reverend Theodosius. "But I understand from my poor
  friend upstairs that the police are satisfied that three scoundrels were
  involved in the crime. And two of them have escaped."</p>

  <p>"Dirty dogs," said Hugh, frowning. "Now if all three had been found
  adhering to the furniture it might have reconciled you to the loss of those
  hundred acid drops."</p>

  <p>"In fact," continued the clergyman, helping himself to some fish, "the
  whole thing is very mysterious. However, the police have every hope of laying
  their hands on the two others very shortly."</p>

  <p>"They're always optimistic, aren't they?" returned Hugh. "Pity no one saw
  these blighters running round and throwing bombs about the house."</p>

  <p>"That is just the fortunate thing, Captain Drummond," said the other
  mildly. "Far be it from me to desire vengeance on any man, but in this case I
  feel it is deserved. The unfortunate clerk downstairs who was brutally
  assaulted by them has confided to his employer that he believes he knows who
  one of the other two was. A huge man. Captain Drummond, of enormous strength:
  a man&mdash;well, really, do you know?&mdash;a man I should imagine just like
  you, and a man, who, popular rumour has it, is the head of a mysterious body
  calling itself the Black Gang. So that should prove a valuable clue for the
  police when they hear of it."</p>

  <p>Not by the flicker of an eyelid did Drummond's face change as he listened
  with polite attention to the clergyman's remarks. But now once again his
  brain was moving quickly as he took in this new development. One card, at any
  rate, was down on the table: his identity as leader of the Black Gang was
  known to Peterson. It was the girl who had found him out: that was obvious.
  The point was how did it affect matters.</p>

  <p>"An elusive person, I believe," he remarked quietly. "We've heard quite a
  lot of him in the papers recently. In fact, I was actually in Sir Bryan
  Johnstone's office when a gentleman of the name of Charles Latter came and
  demanded protection from the Black Gang."</p>

  <p>For a moment a gleam of amazement shone in the other's eye. "You surprise
  me," he murmured. "I trust it was afforded him."</p>

  <p>Hugh waved a vast hand. "Do you doubt it, Mr. Longmoor? I personally
  accompanied him to a house-party to ensure his safety. But as I told old Tum-
  tum afterwards&mdash;that's Sir Bryan Johnstone, you know, a great pal of
  mine&mdash;nothing that I could do could avert the catastrophe. I prattled to
  him gently, but it was no good. He went mad, Mr. Longmoor&mdash;quite, quite
  mad. The boredom of that house-party unhinged his brain. Have another
  chop?"</p>

  <p>"How very extraordinary!" remarked the clergyman. "And what did your
  friend&mdash;er&mdash;Tum-tum say when he heard of the results of your
  supervision?"</p>

  <p>"Well, quite unofficially, Mr. Longmoor, I think he was rather pleased.
  Latter was an unpleasant man, engaged in unpleasant work, and he does less
  harm when insane. A merciful thing, wasn't it, that we found such a suitable
  gathering of guests at our disposal?"</p>

  <p>"And yet," pursued the Reverend Theodosius, "it struck me from an English
  paper I happened to pick up in Paris a little while ago, that the leader of
  this obscure gang claimed in some way to be responsible for the condition of
  Mr. Latter. He issued a ridiculous sort of manifesto to the Press, didn't
  he?"</p>

  <p>"I believe he did," answered Drummond, draining his glass. "An effusion
  which ended with a threat to the people at the back of men like Latter. As if
  it would have any effect! Scum like that, Mr. Longmoor, remain hidden. They
  blush unseen. I do wish you'd have another chop."</p>

  <p>"Thank you&mdash;no." The Reverend Theodosius waved away the waiter and
  leaned back in his chair. "Doubtless you are right, Captain Drummond, in
  championing this person; but if what this wretched, ill-treated clerk says is
  correct, I am afraid I can look on him as nothing less than a common thief.
  Of course, he may have made a mistake, but he seems very positive that one of
  the miscreants last night was the leader of the Black Gang himself."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Drummond, with the air of a man on whom a great truth had
  dawned. "That hundred thick 'uns still rankling in the grey matter what time
  the vestry collapses."</p>

  <p>"Hardly that," returned the clergyman severely. "My friend, whose office
  was wrecked, was amongst other things a dealer in precious stones. Last night
  in his desk were six magnificent diamonds&mdash;entrusted to him for sale by
  a&mdash;well, I will be discreet&mdash;by a well-known Russian nobleman. This
  morning he finds them gone&mdash;vanished&mdash;his room wrecked. Why, my
  heart bleeds for him."</p>

  <p>"I'll bet it does," answered Drummond sympathetically. "Darned careless,
  isn't it, the way some of these people drop bombs about the place? Still, if
  your pal circulates an exact description of the diamonds to the police, he'll
  probably get 'em back in time. I suppose," he added by way of an
  afterthought, "I suppose he can go to the police about it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand you. Captain Drummond." The Reverend Theodosius
  stared at his host in surprise.</p>

  <p>"One never knows, these days, does one?" said Hugh mildly. "Dreadful thing
  to get a nice little bunch of diamonds shot at one's head, and then find
  you've got stolen property. It puts the next fellow who pinches them rather
  on velvet. A cup of coffee, won't you?"</p>

  <p>"Fortunately nothing of that sort exists in this case. Yes, thank you, I
  would like some coffee."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Hugh, giving the order to the waiter. "So that all you've got
  to do&mdash;or rather your pal&mdash;is to tell the police that the office
  was blown up by the leader of the Black Gang, and that the diamonds were
  pinched by the leader of the Black Gang, and that you would like his head on
  a silver salver by Wednesday week. It seems too easy to me. Cigarette?
  Turkish this side&mdash;gaspers the other."</p>

  <p>"Thank you." The Reverend Theodosius helped himself from the case Hugh was
  holding out. "It certainly does seem easy, the way you put it."</p>

  <p>"The only small trifle which seems to jut out from an otherwise clear-cut
  horizon is too ridiculous to worry about."</p>

  <p>"And that is?"</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;who is the leader of the Black Gang? It would be a dreadful
  affair if they brought the wrong bird's head on a charger. No diamonds, no
  Bradburys; no nothing."</p>

  <p>"I don't anticipate that it should be hard to discover that, Captain
  Drummond," said the clergyman mildly. "Surely with your marvellous police
  system..."</p>

  <p>"And yet, Mr. Longmoor," said Hugh gravely, "even though lately I have
  been reinforcing that system&mdash;literally helping them myself&mdash;they
  are still completely in the dark as to his identity."</p>

  <p>"Incredible," cried the other. "Still, we can only hope for the best. By
  the way, I'm afraid your wife has finally deserted you for lunch." He pushed
  back his chair. "I shall hope to have the pleasure of making her acquaintance
  some other day. And now if you will excuse me, I must run away. My
  correspondence at the moment with regard to the relief funds for destitute
  Austrians is very voluminous. A thousand thanks for a most enjoyable
  meal."</p>

  <p>He bowed with a courteous smile, and threaded his way through the crowded
  restaurant towards the door. And it was not until he had finally disappeared
  from sight that Hugh turned to Peter Darrell with a thoughtful expression on
  his face.</p>

  <p>"Deuced interesting position of affairs, Peter," he remarked, lighting
  another cigarette. "He knows I'm the leader of our bunch, and doesn't know I
  know it; I know he's Peterson, and he doesn't know I know it. I wonder how
  long it will be before the gloves come off."</p>

  <p>"Supposing he keeps out of it himself, and gives you away to the police,"
  said Peter. "It'll be rather awkward, old son."</p>

  <p>"Supposing he does, it would be," grinned Hugh. "I'd love to see Tum-
  tum's face. But, my dear old Peter, hasn't your vast brain grasped the one
  essential fact, that that is precisely what he can't do until he's certain I
  haven't got the diamonds? Apart altogether from a variety of very awkward
  disclosures about Number 5, Green Street&mdash;he, or his hunchback friend,
  would have to explain how they gained possession in the first place of those
  stones. I made discreet inquiries this morning, Peter, and that rose-pink
  diamond was one of the Russian Crown jewels. Awkward&mdash;very."</p>

  <p>He smiled and ordered two brandies.</p>

  <p>"Very, very awkward, Peter&mdash;but with distinct elements of humour. And
  I'm inclined to think the time is approaching when the seconds get out of the
  ring."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12">XII. &mdash; IN WHICH COUNT ZADOWA IS INTRODUCED<br>
  TO ALICE IN WONDERLAND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A quarter of an hour later the two young men stepped into
  Piccadilly. Evidently Phyllis was not proposing to turn up, and nothing was
  to be gained by remaining. The next move lay with the other side, and until
  it was played it was merely a question of marking time. At the entrance to
  the Ritz they separated, Peter turning eastwards to keep some mysterious date
  with a female minor star of theatrical London, while Hugh strolled along
  Berkeley Street towards his house. At times a faint smile crossed his face at
  the thought of Peterson devoting his young brain to the matter of starving
  Austrians, but for the most part a portentous frown indicated thought. For
  the life of him he couldn't see what was going to happen next. It appeared to
  him that the air wanted clearing; that in military parlance the situation was
  involved. And it was just as he was standing in Berkeley Square, waving his
  stick vaguely as a material aid to thought, that he felt a touch on his
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, sir," said a voice at his elbow, "but I would like a few words
  with you."</p>

  <p>He looked down, and his eyes narrowed suddenly. Standing beside him was
  the hunchback, Mr. Atkinson, and for a moment Hugh regarded him in silence.
  Then, dismissing a strong inclination to throw this unexpected apparition
  under a passing furniture van, he raised his eyebrows slightly and removed
  his cigar from his mouth. Evidently the next move had begun, and he felt
  curious as to what form it would take.</p>

  <p>"My powers as a conversationalist are well known," he remarked, "amongst a
  large and varied circle. I was not, however, aware that you belonged to it.
  In other words, sir, who the deuce are you and what the dickens do you want
  to talk to me about?"</p>

  <p>"Something which concerns us both very intimately," returned the other.
  "And with regard to the first part of your question&mdash;do you think it
  necessary to keep up the pretence, especially as there are no witnesses
  present. I suggest, however, that as our conversation may be a trifle
  prolonged, and this spot is somewhat draughty, we should adjourn to your
  house; Brook Street, I believe, is where you live. Captain Drummond."</p>

  <p>Hugh removed his cigar, and stared at the hunchback thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I haven't the slightest wish to have a prolonged conversation with you in
  any place, draughty or otherwise," he remarked at length. "However, if you
  are prepared to run the risk of being slung out of the window if you bore me,
  I'll give you ten minutes."</p>

  <p>He turned on his heel and strolled slowly on towards his house, while the
  hunchback, shooting venomous glances at him from time to time, walked by his
  side in silence. And it was not until some five minutes later when they were
  both in Drummond's study that any further remark was made.</p>

  <p>It was Hugh who spoke, standing with his back to the fireplace, and
  looking down on the misshapen little man who sat in an arm-chair facing the
  light. An unpleasant customer, he reflected, now that he saw him close to for
  the first time: a dangerous, vindictive little devil&mdash;but able,
  distinctly able. Just such a type as Peterson would choose for a tool.</p>

  <p>"What is it you wish to say to me?" he said curtly.</p>

  <p>"A few things. Captain Drummond," returned the other, "that may help to
  clear the air. In the first place may I say how pleased I am to make your
  acquaintance in the flesh, so to speak? I have long wanted a little talk with
  the leader of the Black Gang."</p>

  <p>"I trust," murmured Hugh solicitously, "that the sun hasn't proved too
  much for you."</p>

  <p>"Shall we drop this beating about the bush," snapped the other.</p>

  <p>"I shall drop you down the stairs if you talk to me like that, you damned
  little microbe," said Hugh coldly, and the other got to his feet with a
  snarl. His eyes, glaring like those of an angry cat, were fixed on Drummond,
  who suddenly put out a vast hand to screen the lower part of the hunchback's
  face. With a cry of fear he recoiled, and Hugh smiled grimly. So it had been
  Mr. Atkinson himself who had flung the bomb the night before: the eyes that
  had glared at him through the crack in the door were unmistakably the same as
  those he had just looked into over his own hand. With the rest of the face
  blotted out to prevent distraction there could be no doubt about it, and he
  was still smiling grimly as he lowered his hand.</p>

  <p>"So you think I'm the leader of the Black Gang, do you?" he remarked. "I
  don't know that I'm very interested in your thoughts."</p>

  <p>"I don't think: I know," said the hunchback viciously. "I found it out to-
  day."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," murmured Hugh politely. "Would it be indiscreet to ask how you
  found out this interesting fact?"</p>

  <p>"Do you deny it?" demanded the other furiously.</p>

  <p>"My dear little man," said Hugh, "if you said I was the Pope I wouldn't
  deny it. All I ask is that now you've afflicted me with your presence you
  should amuse me. What are your grounds for this somewhat startling
  statement?"</p>

  <p>"My grounds are these," said the hunchback, recovering his self-control:
  "last night my office in Hoxton was wrecked by a bomb."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" interrupted Hugh mildly, "it must be old Theodosius Longmoor
  and his hundred quid. I thought he looked at me suspiciously during
  lunch."</p>

  <p>"It was wrecked by a bomb. Captain Drummond," continued the other, not
  heeding the interruption. "That bomb also killed a man."</p>

  <p>"It did," agreed Hugh grimly.</p>

  <p>"One of the three men who broke in. The other two escaped&mdash;how I
  don't know. But one of them was recognised by the clerk downstairs."</p>

  <p>"I gathered that was the story," said Hugh.</p>

  <p>"He was recognised as the leader of the Black Gang," continued the
  hunchback. "And that was all until to-day. Just the leader of the Black
  Gang&mdash;an unknown person. But to-day&mdash;at the Ritz, Captain
  Drummond&mdash;my clerk, who had brought me a message, recognised him again,
  without his disguise. No longer an unknown man, you understand&mdash;but
  you."</p>

  <p>Drummond smiled, and selected a cigarette from his case.</p>

  <p>"Very pretty," he answered, "but a trifle crude. As I understand you, I
  gather that your shrewd and intelligent clerk states that the leader of the
  Black Gang broke into your office last night in order to indulge in the
  doubtful pastime of throwing bombs about the premises. He further states that
  I am the humorist in question. Allowing for the moment that your clerk is
  sane, what do you propose to do about it?"</p>

  <p>"In certain eventualities, Captain Drummond, I propose to send an
  anonymous letter to Scotland Yard. Surprised though they would be to get it,
  it might help them to clear up the mystery of Mr. Latter's insanity. It may
  prove rather unpleasant for you, of course, but that can't be helped."</p>

  <p>"It's kind of you to give me a loophole of escape," said Drummond
  pleasantly. "What are the eventualities to which you allude?"</p>

  <p>"The non-return to me of a little bag containing diamonds," remarked the
  hunchback quietly. "They were in the desk which was wrecked by the bomb."</p>

  <p>"Dear, dear." said Hugh. "Am I supposed to have them in my
  possession?"</p>

  <p>"I can only hope most sincerely for your sake that you have," returned the
  other. "Otherwise I'm afraid that letter will go to the police."</p>

  <p>For a while Drummond smoked in silence: then, with a lazy smile on his
  face, he sat down in an arm-chair facing the hunchback.</p>

  <p>"Most interesting," he drawled. "Most interesting and entertaining. I'm
  not very quick, Mr.&mdash;, I've forgotten under what name you inflict
  yourself on a long-suffering world, but I shall call you Snooks&mdash;I'm
  not, as I say, very quick. Snooks, but as far as my brain can grapple with
  the problem it stands thus. If I give you back a packet of diamonds which I
  may, or may not, possess you will refrain from informing the police that I am
  the leader of the Black Gang. If, on the contrary, I do not give them back to
  you, you will send them that interesting piece of information by means of an
  anonymous letter." The smile grew even lazier. "Well, you damned little
  excrescence, I call your bluff. Get on with it."</p>

  <p>With a snarl of rage the hunchback snatched up his hat and rose to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"You call it bluff, do you? "&mdash;and his voice was shaking with fury.
  "Very good, you fool&mdash;I accept. And you'll be sorry when you see my
  cards."</p>

  <p>"Sit down. Snooks: I haven't finished with you yet." There was still the
  same maddening smile on Drummond's face, which disappeared suddenly as the
  hunchback moved towards the door. In two strides Hugh had him by the collar,
  and with a force that made his teeth rattle Mr. Atkinson found himself back
  in his chair.</p>

  <p>"I said sit down, Snooks," said Drummond pleasantly. "Don't let me have to
  speak to you again, or I might hurt you. There are one or two things I have
  to say to you before depriving myself of the pleasure of your company. By the
  post following the one which carries your interesting disclosure will go
  another letter addressed to Sir Bryan Johnstone himself. I shall be in the
  office when he opens it&mdash;and we shall both be roaring with laughter over
  the extraordinary delusion that I&mdash;quite the biggest fool of his
  acquaintance&mdash;could possibly be the leader of the Black Gang. And, as if
  to prove the utter absurdity of the suggestion, this second letter will be
  from the leader of the Black Gang himself. In it he will state that he was
  present at 5, Green Street, Hoxton, last night in an endeavour to obtain
  possession of the anarchist and Bolshevist literature stored there. That he
  took with him a professional burglar to assist him in opening the safe and
  other things which might be there, and that while engaged in this eminently
  virtuous proceeding he found that he was trapped in the room by some
  mechanical device. And then, Snooks, will come a very interesting disclosure.
  He will state how suddenly he saw through a crack in the door a pair of eyes
  looking at him. And their colour&mdash;see, what is the colour of your eyes.
  Snooks?&mdash;grey-blue, very noticeable. Much the same as old
  Longmoors&mdash;though his are a little bluer. And then the owner of the
  eyes. Snooks, was so inconsiderate as to throw a bomb in the room; a bomb
  which killed one of the men, and wrecked the desk. So that the owner of the
  eyes, Snooks, grey-blue eyes just like yours, is a murderer&mdash;a common
  murderer. And we hang men in England for murder." He paused and stared at the
  hunchback. "This is a jolly game, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"And you really imagine," said the hunchback contemptuously, "that even
  your police would believe such a story that a man would wreck his own office,
  when on your own showing he had the men trapped inside it."</p>

  <p>"Probably not," said Drummond affably. "Any more than that they would
  believe that I was the leader of the Black Gang. So since they're such a
  wretched crowd of unbelievers I don't think it's much good playing that game,
  Snooks. Waste of time, isn't it? So I vote we play another one, all on our
  own&mdash;a little game of make-believe&mdash;like we used to play in the
  nursery."</p>

  <p>"I haven't an idea what you're talking about. Captain Drummond," said the
  hunchback, shifting uneasily in his chair. For all trace of affability had
  vanished from the face of the man opposite him, to be replaced by an
  expression which made Mr. Atkinson pass his tongue once or twice over lips
  that had suddenly gone dry.</p>

  <p>"Haven't you, you rat?" said Drummond quietly. "Then I'll tell you. Just
  for the next five minutes we're going to pretend that these two astonishing
  statements which the police&mdash;stupid fellows&mdash;won't believe are
  true. We're going to pretend&mdash;only pretend, mind you, Snooks&mdash;that
  I am the leader of the Black Gang; and we're going to pretend that you are
  the man who flung the bomb last night. Just for five minutes only, then we go
  back to reality and unbelieving policemen."</p>

  <p>And if during the following five minutes strange sounds were heard by
  Denny in the room below, he was far too accustomed to the sounds of breaking
  furniture to worry. It wasn't until the hunchback pulled a knife that
  Drummond warmed to his work, but from that moment he lost his temper. And
  because the hunchback was a hunchback&mdash;though endowed withal by Nature
  with singular strength&mdash;it jarred on Drummond to fight him as if he had
  been a normal man. So he flogged him with a rhinoceros-hide whip till his arm
  ached, and then he flung him into a chair, gasping, cursing, and scarcely
  human.</p>

  <p>"You shouldn't be so realistic in your stories. Snooks," he remarked
  affably, though his eyes were still merciless as he looked at the writhing
  figure. "And I feel quite sure that that is what the leader of the Black Gang
  would have done if he had met the peculiar humorist who threw that bomb last
  night. Bad habit&mdash;throwing bombs."</p>

  <p>With a final curse the hunchback staggered to his feet, and his face was
  diabolical in its fury. "You shall pay for that. Captain Drummond, stroke by
  stroke, and lash by lash," he said in a shaking voice.</p>

  <p>Drummond laughed shortly. "All the same, old patter," he remarked. "Tell
  old Longmoor with my love&mdash;" He paused and grinned. "No, on second
  thoughts I think I'll tell his reverence myself&mdash;at the appointed
  time."</p>

  <p>"What will you tell him?" sneered the hunchback.</p>

  <p>"Why, that his church isn't the only place where dry-rot has set in. It's
  prevalent amongst his pals as well. Must you go? Straight down the stairs,
  and the card tray in the hall is only electric-plate&mdash;so you might leave
  it."</p>

  <p>With a great effort Mr. Atkinson pulled himself together. His shoulders
  were still aching abominably from the hiding Drummond had given him, but his
  loss of self-control had been due more to mental than to physical causes.
  Immensely powerful though Drummond was, his clothes had largely broken the
  force of the blows for the hunchback. And now as he stood by the door the
  uppermost thought in his mind was that he had failed utterly and completely
  in the main object of his interview. He had come, if possible, to get the
  diamonds, and failing that, to find out for certain whether Drummond had them
  in his possession or not. And the net result had been a flogging and nothing
  more. Too late he realised that in dealing with men of the type of Hugh
  Drummond anything in the nature of a threat is the surest guarantee of a
  thick ear obtainable: but then Mr. Atkinson was not used to dealing with men
  of that type. And the uppermost thought in his mind at the moment was not how
  he could best revenge himself on this vast brute who had flogged him, but
  what he was going to say to the Reverend Theodosius Longmoor when he got back
  to the Ritz. The question of revenge could wait till later.</p>

  <p>"Can we come to an understanding, Captain Drummond?" he remarked quietly.
  "I can assure you, of course, that you have made a terrible mistake in
  thinking that it was I who threw that bomb at you last night."</p>

  <p>"At me?" Drummond laughed shortly. "Who said you'd thrown it at me? That
  wasn't the game at all, Snooks. You threw it at the leader of the Black
  Gang."</p>

  <p>"Can't we put our cards on the table?" returned the other with studied
  moderation. "I know that you are that leader, you know it&mdash;though it is
  possible that no one else would believe it. I was wrong to threaten
  you&mdash;I should have known better, I apologise. But if I may say so I have
  had my punishment. Now as man to man&mdash;can we come to terms?"</p>

  <p>"I am waiting," said Hugh briefly. "Kindly be as concise as possible."</p>

  <p>"Those diamonds, Captain Drummond. Rightly or wrongly I feel tolerably
  certain that you either have them in your possession, or that you know where
  they are. Now those diamonds were not mine&mdash;did you speak? No.
  Well&mdash;to resume. The diamonds were not mine; they had been deposited in
  the desk in my office unknown to me. Then this fool&mdash;whom you foolishly
  think was myself&mdash;threw the bomb into the office to kill you. I admit
  it; he told me all about it. He did not kill you, for which fact, if I may
  say so, I am very glad. You're a sportsman, and you've fought like a
  sportsman&mdash;but our fight, Captain Drummond, has been over other matters.
  The diamonds are a side-show and hardly concern you and me. I'll be frank
  with you; they are the sole wealth saved by a Russian nobleman from the
  Bolshevist outrages. He deposited them in my office during my absence, with
  the idea of my selling them for him&mdash;and now he and his family must
  starve. And so what I propose is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't think I want to hear your proposal, Snooks," said Drummond
  kindly. "Doubtless I look a fool; doubtless I am a fool, but I like to think
  that I'm not a congenital idiot. I'm glad you have discovered that it's not
  much use threatening me; but to tell you the strict truth, I prefer threats
  to nauseating hypocrisy. So much so in fact that the thought of that starving
  nobleman impels me to take more exercise. Ever read Alice in Wonderland,
  Snooks? A charming book&mdash;a masterpiece of English literature. And there
  is one singularly touching, not to say fruity, bit which concerns Father
  William&mdash;and a genteel young man."</p>

  <p>With a look of complete bewilderment on his face Mr. Atkinson felt himself
  propelled through the door, until he came to a halt at the top of the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>"It's a little poem, Snooks, and some day I will recite it to you. Just
  now I can only remember the one singularly beautiful line which has suggested
  my new form of exercise."</p>

  <p>Mr. Atkinson became aware of a boot in the lower portion of his back, and
  then the stairs seemed to rise up and hit him. He finally came to rest in the
  hall against an old oak chest of the pointed-corner type, and for a moment or
  two he lay there dazed. Then he scrambled to his feet to find three young
  men, who had emerged from a lower room during his flight, gazing at him
  impassively: while standing at the top of the stairs down which he had just
  descended and outlined against a window was the huge, motionless figure of
  Drummond. Half cursing, half sobbing, he staggered to the front door and
  opened it. Once more he looked back&mdash;not one of the four men had moved.
  They were just staring at him in absolute silence, and, with a sudden feeling
  of pure terror. Count Zadowa, alias Mr. Atkinson, shut the door behind him
  and staggered into the sunlit street.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13">XIII. &mdash; IN WHICH HUGH DRUMMOND AND THE<br>
  REVEREND THEODOSIUS HAVE A LITTLE CHAT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Come up, boys," laughed Hugh. "The fog of war is lifting
  slowly."</p>

  <p>He led the way back into the study, and the other three followed him.</p>

  <p>"That object, Ted, you will be pleased to hear, is the humorist who threw
  the bomb at us last night."</p>

  <p>"The devil it was," cried Jerningham. "I hope you gave him something for
  me. Incidentally, how did he run you to earth here?"</p>

  <p>"Things have moved within the last two or three hours," answered Drummond
  slowly. "Who do you think is stopping at the Ritz at the present moment? Who
  do you think lunched with Peter and me to-day? Why&mdash;Peterson, my
  buckos&mdash;no more and no less."</p>

  <p>"Rot!" said Toby Sinclair incredulously.</p>

  <p>"No more and no less. Peterson himself&mdash;disguised as a clergyman
  called Longmoor. And with him is dear Irma encased in woollen garments. And
  it was Irma who spotted the whole thing. I never recognised her, and she was
  sitting next to Peter and me in the lounge when we were discussing things. Of
  course, they're mixed up with that swab I've just kicked down the
  stairs&mdash;in fact, we've bolted the fox. The nuisance of it is that by
  putting two and two together they've spotted me as the leader of our bunch.
  How I don't quite know, but they indubitably have. They also think I've got
  those diamonds: hence the visit of the hunchback, who did not know they were
  in the desk when he bunged the bomb. In fact, things are becoming clearer all
  the way round."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you think so," remarked Algy. "I'm dashed if I see it."</p>

  <p>Drummond thoughtfully filled himself a glass of beer from the cask in the
  corner.</p>

  <p>"Clearer, Algy&mdash;though not yet fully luminous with the light of day.
  Between Peterson and those diamonds there is, or was, a close and tender
  connection. I'll eat my hat on that. Between Peterson and the hunchback there
  is also a close connection&mdash;though I have my doubts if it's tender. And
  then there's me tripping lightly like the good fairy...Hullo! What's
  this?"</p>

  <p>He had opened his desk as he spoke, and was now staring fixedly at the
  lock.</p>

  <p>"It's been forced," he said grimly. "Forced since this morning. They've
  been over this desk while I've been out. Push the bell, Ted."</p>

  <p>They waited in silence till Denny appeared in answer to the ring.</p>

  <p>"Someone has been in this room, Denny,'" said Drummond. "Someone has
  forced this desk since half-past eleven this morning."</p>

  <p>"There's been no one in the house, sir," answered Denny, "except the man
  who came about the electric light."</p>

  <p>"Electric grandmother," snapped his master. "You paralytic idiot, why did
  you leave him alone?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, Mrs. Drummond was in the house at the time&mdash;and the
  servants were all round the place." Denny looked and felt aggrieved, and
  after a while Drummond smiled.</p>

  <p>"What sort of a man was it, you old fathead?"</p>

  <p>"A very respectable sort of man," returned Denny with dignity. "I remarked
  to Mrs. Denny how respectable he was, sir. Why, he actually went some
  distance down the street to call a taxi for Mrs. Drummond to go to the
  Ritz..."</p>

  <p>His words died away, as he stared in amazement at the expression on his
  master's face.</p>

  <p>"What the devil is it, Hugh?" cried Ted Jerningham.</p>

  <p>"He called a taxi, you say?" muttered Drummond. "The man who came here
  called a taxi?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," answered Denny. "He was leaving the house at the same time,
  and as there was none in sight he said he'd send one along at once."</p>

  <p>"And Mrs. Drummond went in the taxi he sent?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir," said Denny in surprise. "To the Ritz, to join you. I
  gave the order myself to the driver."</p>

  <p>The veins were standing out on Drummond's forehead, and for a moment it
  seemed as if he was going to hit his servant. Then with an effort he
  controlled himself, and sank back in his chair with a groan.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, Denny," he said hoarsely. "It's not your fault: you
  couldn't have known. But&mdash;what a fool I've been! All this time wasted,
  when I might have been doing something."</p>

  <p>"But what on earth's happened?" cried Algy.</p>

  <p>"She never turned up at the Ritz, Algy: Phyllis never turned up for lunch.
  At first I thought she was late, and we waited. Then I thought she'd run into
  some pal and had gone to feed somewhere else. And then, what with talking to
  Peterson, and later that hunchback, I forgot all about her."</p>

  <p>"But, good heavens, Hugh, what do you mean?" said Ted. "You don't think
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course I think it. I know it. They've got her: they've kidnapped her.
  Right under my nose." He rose and began to pace up and down the room with
  long, uneven strides, while the others watched him anxiously.</p>

  <p>"That damned girl heard me say that she was coming to lunch, and just
  after that she went upstairs. And Peterson, being Peterson, took a
  chance&mdash;and he's pulled it off."</p>

  <p>"Ring up Scotland Yard, man," cried Toby Sinclair.</p>

  <p>"What the devil am I to tell them? They'd think I was off my head. And
  I've got no proof that Peterson is at the bottom of it. I haven't even got
  any proof that would convince them that Longmoor is Peterson."</p>

  <p>Algy Longworth stood up, serious for once in a way. "There's no time now
  to beat about the bush, Hugh. If they've got Phyllis there's only one
  possible thing that you can do. Go straight to Bryan Johnstone and put all
  your cards on the table. Tell him the whole thing from A to Z&mdash;conceal
  nothing. And then leave the matter in his hands. He won't let you down."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two Hugh faced them undecided. The sudden danger to
  Phyllis seemed to have robbed him temporarily of his power of initiative; for
  the time he had ceased to be the leader.</p>

  <p>"Algy's right," said Jerningham quietly. "It doesn't matter a damn what
  happens to us, you've got to think about Phyllis. We'll get it in the
  neck&mdash;but there was always that risk."</p>

  <p>"I believe you're right," muttered Hugh, looking round for his hat. "My
  brain's all buzzing, I can't think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And at that moment the telephone bell rang on his desk.</p>

  <p>"Answer it, Ted," said Hugh.</p>

  <p>Jerningham picked up the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;this is Captain Drummond's house. No&mdash;it's not him
  speaking. Yes&mdash;I'll give him any message you like. Who are you? Who? Mr.
  Longmoor at the Ritz. I see. Yes&mdash;he told me you had lunched with him
  to-day. Oh! yes, certainly."</p>

  <p>For a while Ted Jerningham stood holding the receiver to his ear, and only
  the thin, metallic voice of the speaker at the other end broke the silence of
  the room. It went on, maddeningly indistinct to the three men crowding round
  the instrument, broken only by an occasional monosyllable from Jerningham.
  Then with a final&mdash;"I will certainly tell him," Ted laid down the
  instrument.</p>

  <p>"What did he say, Ted?" demanded Hugh agitatedly.</p>

  <p>"He sent a message to you, old man. It was approximately to this
  effect&mdash;that he was feeling very uneasy because your wife had not turned
  up at lunch, and that he hoped there had been no accident. He further went on
  to say that since he had parted from you a most peculiar piece of information
  had come to his knowledge, which, incredible though it might appear, seemed
  to bear on her failure to turn up at the Ritz. He most earnestly begged that
  you should go round and see him at once&mdash;because if his information was
  correct any delay might prove most dangerous for her. And lastly, on no
  account were you to go to the police until you had seen him."</p>

  <p>For a while there was silence in the room. Drummond, frowning heavily, was
  staring out of the window; the others, not knowing what to say, were waiting
  for him to speak. And after a while he swung round, and they saw that the air
  of indecision had gone.</p>

  <p>"That simplifies matters considerably," he said quietly. "It reduces it to
  the old odds of Peterson and me."</p>

  <p>"But you'll go to the police, old man," cried Algy. "You won't pay any
  attention to that message. He'll never know that you haven't come straight to
  him."</p>

  <p>Drummond laughed shortly. "Have you forgotten the rules so much, Algy,
  that you think that? Look out of the window, man, only don't be seen. There's
  a fellow watching the house now&mdash;I couldn't go a yard without Peterson
  knowing. Moreover I'm open to a small bet that he knew I was in the house
  when he was talking to Ted. Good heavens! No. Peterson is not the sort of man
  to play those monkey-tricks with. He's got Phyllis, the whole thing is his
  show. And if I went to the police, long before they could bring it home to
  him, or get her back&mdash;she'd be&mdash;why&mdash;"&mdash;and once again
  the veins stood out on his forehead&mdash;"Lord knows what the swine wouldn't
  have done to her. It's just a barter at the present moment&mdash;the diamonds
  against her. And there's going to be no haggling. They win the first
  round&mdash;but there are a few more on the horizon."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" said Ted.</p>

  <p>"Exactly what he suggests," answered Hugh. "Go round and see him at the
  Ritz&mdash;now, at once. I shan't take the diamonds with me, but there will
  be no worry over the exchange as far as I'm concerned. It's just like his
  dirty method of fighting to go for a girl," he finished savagely.</p>

  <p>"You don't think they've hurt Mrs. Drummond, sir," said Denny
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>"If they have, they'll find the remains of an elderly parson in
  Piccadilly," returned Hugh, as he slipped a small revolver into his pocket.
  "But I don't think so. Carl is far too wise to do anything so stupid as that.
  He's tried with the hunchback and failed, now he's trying this. And he wins."
  He crossed to the door and opened it. "In case I don't come back by six, the
  diamonds are in my sponge bag in the bathroom&mdash;and go straight to
  Scotland Yard. Tell Tum-tum the whole yarn."</p>

  <p>With a brief nod he was gone, and a moment later he was in the street. It
  was almost deserted, and he waited on the pavement for the loitering
  gentleman who came obsequiously forward. "Taxi, sir?"</p>

  <p>A convenient one&mdash;an almost too convenient one&mdash;came to a
  standstill beside them, and Hugh noticed a quick look flash between the
  driver and the other man. Then he took stock of the taxi, and behold it was
  not quite as other taxis. And in his mind arose an unholy desire. As has been
  said, the street was nearly deserted, and it was destined to become even more
  deserted. There was a crash of breaking glass and the loiterer disappeared
  through one window of the machine.</p>

  <p>Hugh stared at the astounded driver.</p>

  <p>"If you say one word, you appalling warthog," he remarked gently, "I'll
  throw you through the other."</p>

  <p>It was a happy omen, and he felt better as he walked towards the Ritz.
  Simple and direct&mdash;that was the game. No more tortuous intrigues for
  him; hit first and apologise afterwards. And he was still in the same mood
  when he was shown into the sitting-room where the Reverend Theodosius
  Longmoor was busily working on Austrian famine accounts. He rose as Hugh
  entered, and his daughter, still knitting busily, gave him a charming girlish
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Ah! my dear young friend," began Mr. Longmoor, "I see you've had my
  message."</p>

  <p>"Yes," answered Hugh affably, "I was standing next door to the fellow you
  were talking to. But before we come to business, so to speak&mdash;I must
  really ask you not to send Snooks round again. I don't like him. Why, my dear
  Carl, I preferred our late lamented Henry Lakington."</p>

  <p>There was a moment of dead silence, during which the Reverend Theodosius
  stared at him speechlessly and the busy knitter ceased to knit. The shock was
  so complete and sudden that even Carl Peterson seemed at a loss, and Drummond
  laughed gently as he took a chair.</p>

  <p>"I'm tired of this dressing-up business, Carl," he remarked in the same
  affable voice. "And it's so stupid to go on pretending when everybody knows.
  So I thought we might as well have all the cards on the table. Makes the game
  much easier."</p>

  <p>He selected a cigarette with care, and offered his case to the girl.</p>

  <p>"My most hearty congratulations, mademoiselle," he continued. "I may say
  that it was not you I recognised, but your dear&mdash;it is father still,
  isn't it? And now that we've all met again you must tell me some time how you
  got away last year."</p>

  <p>But by this time the clergyman had found his voice. "Are you mad, sir?" he
  spluttered. "Are you insane? How dare you come into this room and insult my
  daughter and myself? I shall ring the bell, sir, and have you removed."</p>

  <p>He strode across the room, and Drummond watched him calmly. "I've just
  called one bluff this afternoon, Carl," he said lazily. "Now I'll call
  another. Go on, push the bell. Send for the police and say I've insulted you.
  Go and see dear old Tum-tum yourself: he'll be most awfully braced at meeting
  you."</p>

  <p>The other's hand fell slowly to his side, and he looked at his daughter
  with a resigned expression in his face.</p>

  <p>"Really, my dear, I think that the heat&mdash;or perhaps&mdash;" He paused
  expressively, and Drummond laughed.</p>

  <p>"You were always a good actor, Carl, but is it worth while? There are no
  witnesses here, and I'm rather pressed for time. There's no good pretending
  that it's the heat or that I'm tight, because I'm the only member of the
  audience, and you can't deceive me, you really can't. Through a series of
  accidents you have become aware of the fact that I am the leader of the Black
  Gang. You can go and tell the police if you like&mdash;in fact, that horrible
  little man who came round to see me threatened to do so. But, if you do so, I
  shall tell them who you are, and I shall also inform them of the secret
  history of the bomb. So that, though it will be awkward for me, Carl, it will
  be far more awkward for you and Mademoiselle Irma; and it will be positively
  unhealthy for Snooks. You take me so far, don't you? Up to date I have been
  dealing in certainties; now we come to contingencies. It strikes me that
  there are two doubtful points, old friend of my youth&mdash;just two. And
  those two points are the whereabouts respectively of my wife and your
  diamonds. Now, Carl, do we talk business or not?"</p>

  <p>"My dear young man," said the other resignedly, "I intended to talk
  business with you when you arrived if you had given me a chance. But as
  you've done nothing but talk the most unmitigated drivel since you've come
  into the room I haven't had a chance. You appear obsessed with this absurd
  delusion that I am some person called Carl, and&mdash;But where are you
  going?"</p>

  <p>Drummond paused at the door.</p>

  <p>"I am going straight to Scotland Yard. I shall there tell Sir Bryan
  Johnstone the whole story from A to Z, at the same time handing him a little
  bag containing diamonds which has recently come into my possession."</p>

  <p>"You admit you've got them," snapped the other, letting the mask drop for
  a moment.</p>

  <p>"That's better, Carl&mdash;much better." Drummond came back into the room.
  "I admit I've got them&mdash;but they're in a place where you can never find
  them, and they will remain there until six o'clock to-night, when they go
  straight to Scotland Yard&mdash;unless, Carl&mdash;unless my wife is returned
  to me absolutely unscathed and unhurt before that hour. It is five o'clock
  now."</p>

  <p>"And if she is returned&mdash;what then?"</p>

  <p>"You shall have the diamonds."</p>

  <p>For a space the two men stared at one another in silence, and it was the
  girl who finally spoke.</p>

  <p>"What proof have we that you'll keep your word?"</p>

  <p>"Common sense," said Hugh quietly. "My wife is somewhat more valuable to
  me than a bagful of diamonds. In addition, you know me well enough to know
  that I do not break my word. Anyway, those are my terms&mdash;take them or
  leave them. But I warn you that should anything happen to her&mdash;nothing
  will prevent me going straight to the police. No consideration of unpleasant
  results for me will count even for half a second. Well, do you accept?"</p>

  <p>"There is just one point. Captain Drummond," remarked the clergyman
  mildly. "Supposing that I am able to persuade certain people
  to&mdash;er&mdash;expedite the return of Mrs. Drummond in exchange for that
  little bag, where do you and I stand after the bargain is transacted. Do you
  still intend to tell the police of your extraordinary delusions with regard
  to me?"</p>

  <p>"Not unless they should happen to become acquainted with the ridiculous
  hallucination that I am the leader of the Black Gang," answered Drummond.
  "That was for your ears alone, my little one, and as you knew it already, you
  won't get fat on it, will you? No, my intentions&mdash;since we are having a
  heart-to-heart talk&mdash;are as follows. Once the exchange is effected we
  will start quite fair and square&mdash;just like last time, Carl. It doesn't
  pay you to go to the police: it doesn't pay me, so we'll have a single on our
  own. I am frightfully anxious to add you to my collection of specimens, and I
  can't believe you are burning with zeal to go. But we'll see, Carl, we'll
  see. Only&mdash;no more monkey-tricks with my wife. Don't let there be any
  misunderstanding on that point."</p>

  <p>The clergyman smiled benevolently.</p>

  <p>"How aptly you put things!" he murmured. "I accept your terms, and I shall
  look forward afterwards to the single on our own that you speak about. And
  now&mdash;as to details. You must bear in mind that just as Mrs. Drummond is
  more valuable to you than diamonds, she is also somewhat larger. In other
  words, it will be obvious at once whether those whom I represent have kept
  their side of the bargain by producing your wife. It will not be obvious
  whether you have kept yours. The diamonds may or may not be in your pocket,
  and once you have your wife in your arms again the incentive to return the
  diamonds would be diminished. So I suggest. Captain Drummond, that you should
  bring the diamonds to me&mdash;here in this room, before six o'clock as a
  proof of good faith. You may keep them in your possession; all that I require
  is to see them. I will then engage on my side to produce Mrs. Drummond within
  a quarter of an hour."</p>

  <p>For a moment Drummond hesitated, fearing a trick. And yet it was a
  perfectly reasonable request, as he admitted to himself. From their point of
  view it was quite true that they could have no proof that he would keep his
  word, and once Phyllis was in the room there would be nothing to prevent the
  two of them quietly walking out through the door and telling the Reverend
  Theodosius to go to hell.</p>

  <p>"Nothing can very well happen at the Ritz, can it?" continued the
  clergyman suavely. "And you see I am even trusting you to the extent that I
  do not actually ask you to hand over the diamonds until your wife comes. I
  have no guarantee that even then you will not get up and leave the room with
  them still in your possession. You are too big and strong a man. Captain
  Drummond, to allow of any horseplay&mdash;especially&mdash;er&mdash;in a
  clergyman's suite of rooms."</p>

  <p>Drummond laughed. "Cut it out, Carl!" he exclaimed. "Cut it out, for
  heaven's sake! All right. I agree. I'll go round and get the stones now."</p>

  <p>He rose and went to the door.</p>

  <p>"But don't forget, Carl&mdash;if there are any monkey-tricks, heaven help
  you."</p>

  <p>The door closed behind him, and with a snarl the clergyman spun round on
  the girl.</p>

  <p>"How the devil has he spotted us?" His face was convulsed with rage. "He's
  the biggest fool in the world, and yet he spots me every time. However,
  there's no time to worry about that now; we must think."</p>

  <p>He took one turn up and down the room, then he nodded his head as if he
  had come to a satisfactory decision. And when he spoke to the girl, who sat
  waiting expectantly on the sofa, he might have been the head of a big
  business firm giving orders to his managers for the day.</p>

  <p>"Ring up headquarters of A Branch," he said quietly. "Tell them to send
  round Number 13 to this room at once. He must be here within a quarter of an
  hour."</p>

  <p>"Number 13," repeated the girl, making a note. "That's the man who is such
  a wonderful mimic, isn't it? Well?"</p>

  <p>"Number 10 and the Italian are to come with him, and they are to wait
  below for further orders."</p>

  <p>"That all?" She rose to her feet as the Reverend Theodosius crossed
  rapidly to the door which led to the bathroom. "What about that silly little
  fool&mdash;his wife?"</p>

  <p>For a moment the man paused, genuine amazement on his face.</p>

  <p>"My dear girl, you don't really imagine I ever intended to produce her, do
  you? And any lingering doubt I might have had on the matter disappeared the
  moment I found Drummond knew us. There's going to be no mistake this time
  over that young gentleman, believe me."</p>

  <p>With a slight laugh he disappeared into the bathroom, and as little Janet
  put through her call a tinkling of bottles seemed to show that the Reverend
  Theodosius was not wasting time.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14">XIV. &mdash; IN WHICH A ROLLS-ROYCE RUNS AMOK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Some ten minutes later he emerged from the bathroom
  carefully carrying a saucer in his hand. The girl's announcement that Number
  13 had started at once had been received with a satisfied grunt, but he had
  spoken no word. And the girl, glancing through the door, saw him, with his
  shirt sleeves rolled up above his elbows, carefully mixing two liquids
  together and stirring the result gently with a glass rod. He was completely
  absorbed in his task, and with a faint smile on her face she went back to the
  sofa and waited. She knew too well the futility of speaking to him on such
  occasions. Even when he came in, carrying the result of his labours with a
  pair of india-rubber gloves on his hands, she made no remark, but waited for
  him to relieve her curiosity.</p>

  <p>He placed the mixture on the table and glanced round the room. Then he
  pulled up one of the ordinary stuff arm-chairs to the table and removed the
  linen head-rest, which he carefully soaked with the contents of the saucer,
  dabbing the liquid on with a sponge, so as not to crumple the linen in any
  way. He used up all the liquid, and then, still with the same meticulous
  care, he replaced the head-rest on the chair, and stood back and surveyed his
  handiwork.</p>

  <p>"Look all right?" he asked briefly.</p>

  <p>"Quite," answered the girl. "What's the game?"</p>

  <p>"Drummond has got to sit in that chair," he returned, removing the saucer
  and the sponge to the bathroom, and carefully peeling off his gloves. "He's
  got to sit in that chair, my dear, and afterwards that linen affair has got
  to be burnt. And whatever happens "&mdash;he paused for a moment in front of
  her&mdash;"don't you touch it."</p>

  <p>Quietly and methodically, he continued his preparations, as if the most
  usual occurrence in the world was in progress. He picked up two other chairs,
  and carried them through into the bedroom; then he returned and placed an
  open dispatch-case with a sheaf of loose papers on another one.</p>

  <p>"That more or less limits the seating accommodation," he remarked,
  glancing round the room. "Now if you, cara mia, will spread some of your
  atrocious woollen garments on the sofa beside you, I think we can guarantee
  the desired result."</p>

  <p>But apparently his preparations were not over yet. He crossed to the
  sideboard and extracted a new and undecanted bottle of whisky. From this he
  withdrew about a dessertspoonful of the spirit, and replaced it with the
  contents of a small phial which he took out of his waistcoat pocket. Then he
  forced back the cork until it was right home, and with the greatest care
  replaced the cap of tinfoil round the top of the bottle. And the girl, coming
  over to where he was working, saw that the bottle was again as new.</p>

  <p>"What a consummate artist you are, cheri!" she said, laying a hand on his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>The Reverend Theodosius smiled and passed his arm round her waist.</p>

  <p>"One of the earliest essentials of our&mdash;er&mdash;occupation, my
  little one, is to learn how to insert dope into an apparently untouched
  bottle."</p>

  <p>"But do you think you will get him to drink even out of a new bottle?"</p>

  <p>"I hope so. I shall drink myself. But even if he doesn't, the preparation
  on the chair is the essential thing. Once his neck touches that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>With an expressive wave of his hand he vanished once more into the
  bathroom, returning with his coat.</p>

  <p>"Don't you remember that Italian toxicologist&mdash;Fransioli?" he
  remarked. "We met him in Naples three years ago, and he obligingly told me
  that he had in his possession the secret of one of the real Borgia poisons. I
  remember I had a most interesting discussion with him on the subject. The
  internal application is harmless; the external application is what matters.
  That acts alone, but if the victim can be induced to take it internally as
  well it acts very much better."</p>

  <p>"Fransioli?" She frowned thoughtfully. "Wasn't that the name of the man
  who had the fatal accident on Vesuvius?"</p>

  <p>"That's the fellow," answered the Reverend Theodosius, arranging a siphon
  and some glasses on a tray. "He persuaded me to ascend it with him, and on
  the way up he was foolish enough to tell me that the bottles containing this
  poison had been stolen from his laboratory. I don't know whether he suspected
  me or not&mdash;I was an Austrian Baron at the time, if I remember
  aright&mdash;but when he proceeded to peer over the edge of the crater at a
  most dangerous point I thought it better to take no risks.
  So&mdash;er&mdash;the accident occurred. And I gathered he was really a great
  loss to science."</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch, and the girl laughed delightedly. "It will be
  interesting to see if his claims for it are true," he continued thoughtfully.
  "I have only used it once, but on that occasion I inadvertently put too much
  into the wine, and the patient died. But with the right quantities it
  produces&mdash;so he stated, and I saw him experiment on a dog&mdash;a type
  of partial paralysis, not only of the body, but of the mind. You can see, you
  can hear, but you can't speak and you can't move. What ultimately happens
  with a human being I don't know, but the dog recovered."</p>

  <p>A quick double knock came at the door, and with a final glance round the
  room the Reverend Theodosius crossed to his desk and sat down.</p>

  <p>"Come in," he called, and a small dapper-looking man entered.</p>

  <p>"Number 13, sir," said the newcomer briefly, and the other nodded.</p>

  <p>"I am expecting a man here shortly, 13," remarked the clergyman, "whose
  voice I shall want you to imitate over the telephone.</p>

  <p>"Only over the telephone, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Only over the telephone. You will not be able to be in this room, but
  there is a bathroom adjoining in which you can hear every word that is
  spoken." The other nodded as if satisfied. "For how long will you require to
  hear him talk?"</p>

  <p>"Five or ten minutes, sir, will be ample."</p>

  <p>"Good. You shall have that. There's the bathroom. Go in, and don't make a
  sound."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir."</p>

  <p>"And wait. Have Giuseppi and Number 10 come yet?"</p>

  <p>"They left headquarters, sir, just after I did. They should be here by
  now."</p>

  <p>The man disappeared into the bathroom, closing the door behind him, and
  once again the Reverend Theodosius glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Our young friend should be here shortly," he murmured. "And then the
  single which he seems so anxious to play can begin in earnest."</p>

  <p>The benign expression which he had adopted as part of his role disappeared
  for an instant to be replaced by a look of cold fury.</p>

  <p>"The single will begin in earnest," he repeated softly, "and it's the last
  one he will ever play."</p>

  <p>The girl shrugged her shoulders. "He has certainly asked for it," she
  remarked, "but it strikes me that you had better be careful. You may bet on
  one thing&mdash;that he hasn't kept his knowledge about you and me to
  himself. Half those young idiots that run about behind him know everything by
  this time, and if they go to Scotland Yard it will be very unpleasant for us,
  mon cheri. And that they certainly will do if anything should happen to dear
  Hugh."</p>

  <p>The clergyman smiled resignedly. "After all these years, you think it
  necessary to say that to me! My dear, you pain me&mdash;you positively wound
  me to the quick. I will guarantee that all Drummond's friends sleep soundly
  in their beds to-night, harbouring none but the sweetest thoughts of the
  kindly and much-maligned old clergyman at the Ritz."</p>

  <p>"And what of Drummond himself?" continued the girl.</p>

  <p>"It may be to-night, or it may be to-morrow. But accidents happen at all
  times&mdash;and one is going to happen to him." He smiled sweetly, and lit a
  cigar. "A nasty, sticky accident which will deprive us of his presence. I
  haven't worried over the details yet&mdash;but doubtless the inspiration will
  come. And here, if I mistake not, is our hero himself."</p>

  <p>The door swung open and Drummond entered. "Well, Carl, old lad," he
  remarked breezily, "here I am on the stroke of time with the bag of nuts all
  complete."</p>

  <p>"Excellent," murmured the clergyman, waving a benevolent hand towards the
  only free chair. "But if you must call me by my Christian name, why not make
  it Theo?" Drummond grinned delightedly.</p>

  <p>"As you wish, my little one. Theo it shall be in future, and Janet." He
  bowed to the girl as he sat down. "There's just one little point I want to
  mention, Theo, before we come to the laughter and games. Peter Darrell, whom
  you may remember of old, and who lunched with us to-day, is sitting on the
  telephone in my house. And eight o'clock is the time limit. Should his
  childish fears for my safety and my wife's not be assuaged by that hour, he
  will feel compelled to interrupt Tum-tum at his dinner. I trust I make myself
  perfectly clear."</p>

  <p>"You are the soul of lucidity," beamed the clergyman.</p>

  <p>"Good! Then first of all, there are the diamonds. No, don't come too near,
  please, you can count them quite easily from where you are." He tumbled them
  out of the bag, and they lay on the table like great pools of liquid light.
  The girl's breath came quickly as she saw them, and Drummond turned on her
  with a smile.</p>

  <p>"To one given up to good works and knitting, Janet, doubtless, such things
  do not appeal. Tell me, Theo," he remarked as he swept them back into the
  bag&mdash;"who was the idiot who put them in Snooks' desk? Don't answer if
  you'd rather not give away your maidenly secrets; but it was a pretty full-
  sized bloomer on his part, wasn't it&mdash;pooping off the old bomb?"</p>

  <p>He leaned back in his chair, and for a moment a gleam shone in the other's
  eyes, for the nape of Drummond's neck came exactly against the centre of the
  impregnated linen cover.</p>

  <p>"Doubtless, Captain Drummond, doubtless," he murmured politely. "But if
  you will persist in talking in riddles, don't you think we might choose a
  different subject until Mrs. Drummond arrives?"</p>

  <p>"Anything you like, Theo," said Drummond. "I'm perfectly happy talking
  about you. How the devil do you do it?" He sat up and stared at the other man
  with genuine wonder on his face. "Eyes
  different&mdash;nose&mdash;voice&mdash;figure&mdash;everything different.
  You're a marvel&mdash;but for that one small failing of yours."</p>

  <p>"You interest me profoundly," said the clergyman. "What is this one small
  failing that makes you think I am other than what I profess to be?"</p>

  <p>Drummond laughed genially.</p>

  <p>"Good heavens, don't you know what it is? Hasn't Janet told you? It's that
  dainty little trick of yours of tickling the left ear with the right big toe
  that marks you every time. No man can do that, Theo, and blush unseen."</p>

  <p>He leaned back again in his chair, and passed his hand over his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"By Jove, it's pretty hot in here, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"It is close everywhere to-day," answered the other easily, though his
  eyes behind the spectacles were fixed intently on Drummond. "Would you care
  for a drink?"</p>

  <p>Drummond smiled; the sudden fit of muzziness seemed to have passed as
  quickly as it had come.</p>

  <p>"Thank you&mdash;no," he answered politely. "In your last incarnation,
  Theo, you may remember that I did not drink with you. There is an element of
  doubt about your liquor which renders it a dangerous proceeding."</p>

  <p>"As you will," said the clergyman indifferently, at the same time placing
  the bottle of whisky and the glasses on the table. "If you imagine that I am
  capable of interfering with an unopened bottle of Johnny Walker, obtained
  from the cellars of the Ritz, it would be well not to join me." He was
  carefully removing the tinfoil as he spoke, and once again the strange muzzy
  feeling swept over Drummond. He felt as if things had suddenly become
  unreal&mdash;as if he was dreaming. His vision seemed blurred, and then for
  the second time it passed away, leaving only a strange mental confusion. What
  was he doing in this room? Who was this benevolent old clergyman drawing the
  cork out of a bottle of whisky?</p>

  <p>With an effort he pulled himself together. It must be the heat or
  something, he reflected, and he must keep his brain clear. Perhaps a
  whisky-and-soda would help. After all, there could be no danger in drinking
  from a bottle which he had seen opened under his very eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do you know, Theo," he remarked, "I think I will change my mind and have
  a whisky-and-soda."</p>

  <p>His voice sounded strange to his ears; and he wondered if the others
  noticed anything. But apparently not; the clergyman merely nodded briefly,
  and remarked, "Say when."</p>

  <p>"When," said Drummond, with a foolish sort of laugh. It was a most
  extraordinary thing, but he couldn't focus his eyes; there were two glasses
  on the table and two clergymen splashing in soda from two siphons. Surely he
  wasn't going to faint; bad thing to faint when he was alone with
  Peterson.</p>

  <p>He took a gulp at his drink and suddenly began to talk&mdash;foolishly and
  idiotically.</p>

  <p>"Nice room, Carl, old lad...Never expected meet you again: certainly not
  in nice room...Wrote letter paper after poor old Latter went mad. Drew
  you&mdash;drew badger. Send badger mad too."</p>

  <p>His voice trailed away, and he sat there blinking stupidly. Everything was
  confused, and his tongue seemed weighted with lead. He reached out again for
  his glass&mdash;or tried to&mdash;and his arm refused to move. And suddenly
  out of the jumble of thoughts in his brain there emerged the one damning
  certainty that somehow or other he had been trapped and drugged. He gave a
  hoarse, inarticulate cry, and struggled to rise to his feet, but it was
  useless; his legs and arms felt as if they were bound to the chair by iron
  bands. And in the mist that swam before his eyes he saw the mocking faces of
  the clergyman and his daughter.</p>

  <p>"It seems to have acted most excellently," remarked the Reverend
  Theodosius, and Drummond found he could hear quite normally; also his sight
  was improving; things in the room seemed steadier. And his mind was becoming
  less confused&mdash;he could think again. But to move or to speak was utterly
  impossible; all he could do was to sit and watch and rage inwardly at having
  been such a fool as to trust Peterson.</p>

  <p>But that gentleman appeared in no hurry. He was writing with a gold pencil
  on a letter pad, and every now and then he paused and smiled thoughtfully. At
  length he seemed satisfied, and crossed to the bathroom door.</p>

  <p>"We are ready now," Drummond heard him say, and he wondered what was going
  to happen next. To turn his head was impossible; his range of vision was
  limited by the amount he could turn his eyes. And then, to his amazement, he
  heard his own voice speaking from somewhere behind him&mdash;not, perhaps,
  quite so deep, but an extraordinary good imitation which would have deceived
  nine people out of ten when they could not see the speaker. And then he heard
  Peterson's voice again mentioning the telephone, and he realised what they
  were going to do.</p>

  <p>"I want you," Peterson was saying, "to send this message that I have
  written down to that number&mdash;using this gentleman's voice."</p>

  <p>They came into his line of vision, and the new arrival stared at him
  curiously. But he asked no questions&mdash;merely took the paper and read it
  through carefully. Then he stepped over to the telephone, and took off the
  receiver. And, helplessly impotent, Drummond sat in his chair and heard the
  following message spoken in his own voice:</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Peter, old bird? I've made the most unholy bloomer. This old
  bloke Theodosius isn't Carl at all. He's a perfectly respectable pillar of
  the Church."</p>

  <p>And then apparently Darrell said something, and Peterson, who was
  listening through the second ear-piece, whispered, urgently to the man.</p>

  <p>"Phyllis," he went on&mdash;"she's as right as rain! The whole thing is a
  boss shot of the first order...."</p>

  <p>Drummond made another stupendous effort to rise, and for a moment
  everything went blank. Dimly he heard his own voice still talking into the
  instrument, but he only caught a word here and there, and then it ceased, and
  he realised that the man had left the room. It was Peterson's voice close by
  him that cleared his brain again.</p>

  <p>"I trust you approve of the way our single has started. Captain Drummond,"
  he remarked pleasantly. "Your friend Peter, I am glad to say, is more than
  satisfied, and has announced his intention of dining with some female
  charmer. Also he quite understands why your wife has gone into the
  country&mdash;you heard that bit, I hope, about her sick cousin?&mdash;and he
  realises that you are joining her."</p>

  <p>And suddenly the pleasant voice ceased, and the clergyman continued in a
  tone of cold, malignant fury.</p>

  <p>"You rat! You damned interfering young swine! Now that you're helpless I
  don't mind admitting that I am the man you knew as Carl Peterson, but I'm not
  going to make the mistake he made a second time. I underestimated you.
  Captain Drummond. I left things to that fool Lakington. I treated you as a
  blundering young ass, and I realised too late that you weren't such a fool as
  you looked. This time I am paying you the compliment of treating you as a
  dangerous enemy, and a clever man. I trust you are nattered."</p>

  <p>He turned as the door opened, and the man who had telephoned came in with
  two others. One was a great, powerful-looking man who might have been a
  prize-fighter; the other was a lean, swarthy-skinned foreigner, and both of
  them looked unpleasant customers. And Hugh wondered what was going to happen
  next, while his eyes rolled wildly from side to side as if in search of some
  way of escape. It was like some ghastly nightmare when one is powerless to
  move before some dreadful figment of the brain, only to be saved at the last
  moment by waking up. Only in Hugh's case he was awake already, and the dream
  was reality.</p>

  <p>He saw the men leave the room, and then Peterson came over to him again.
  First he took the little bag of diamonds out of his pocket, and it struck
  Hugh that though he had seen the other's hand go into his pocket, he had felt
  nothing. He watched Peterson and the girl as they examined the stones; he
  watched Peterson as he locked them up in a steel dispatch-case. And then
  Peterson disappeared out of his range of vision. He was conscious that he was
  near him&mdash;just behind him&mdash;and the horror of the nightmare
  increased. It had been better when they were talking; at least then he could
  see them. But now, with both of them out of sight&mdash;hovering round the
  back of his chair, perhaps&mdash;and without a sound in the room save the
  faint hum of the traffic outside, the strain was getting unbearable.</p>

  <p>And then another thought came to add to his misery. If they killed
  him&mdash;and they intended to, he was certain&mdash;what would happen to
  Phyllis? They'd got her too, somewhere; what were they going to do to her?
  Again he made a superhuman effort to rise; again he failed so much as to move
  his finger. And for a while he raved and blasphemed mentally. It was
  hopeless, utterly hopeless; he was caught like a rat in a trap.</p>

  <p>And then he began to think coherently again. After all, they couldn't kill
  him here in the Ritz. You can't have dead men lying about in your room in an
  hotel. And they would have to move him some time; they couldn't leave him
  sitting there. How were they going to get him out? He couldn't walk, and to
  carry him out as he was would be impossible. Too many of the staff below knew
  him by sight.</p>

  <p>Suddenly Peterson came into view again. He was in his shirt sleeves and
  was smoking a cigar, and Hugh watched him sorting out papers. He seemed
  engrossed in the matter, and paid no more attention to the helpless figure at
  the table than he did to the fly on the window. At length he completed his
  task, and having closed the dispatch-case with a snap, he rose and stood
  facing Hugh.</p>

  <p>"Enjoying yourself?" he remarked. "Wondering what is going to happen?
  Wondering where dear Phyllis is?" He gave a short laugh. "Excellent drug
  that, isn't it? The first man I tried it on died&mdash;so you're lucky. You
  never felt me put a pin into the back of your arm, did you?"</p>

  <p>He laughed again; in fact, the Reverend Theodosius seemed in an excellent
  temper.</p>

  <p>"Well, my friend, you really asked for it this time, and I'm afraid you're
  going to get it. I cannot have someone continually worrying me like this, so
  I'm going to kill you, as I always intended to some day. It's a pity, and in
  many ways I regret it, but you must admit yourself that you really leave me
  no alternative. It will appear to be accidental, so you need entertain no
  bitter sorrow that I shall suffer in any way. And it will take place very
  soon&mdash;so soon, in fact, that I doubt if you will recover from the
  effects of the drug. I wouldn't guarantee it: you might. As I say, you are
  only the second person on whom I have tried it. And with regard to your
  wife&mdash;our little Phyllis&mdash;it may interest you to know that I have
  not yet made up my mind. I may find it necessary for her to share in your
  accident&mdash;or even to have one all on her own: I may not."</p>

  <p>The raving fury in Drummond's mind as his tormentor talked on showed
  clearly in his eyes, and Peterson laughed.</p>

  <p>"Our friend is getting quite agitated, my dear," he remarked, and the girl
  came into sight. She was smoking a cigarette, and for a while they stared at
  their helpless victim much as if he was a specimen in a museum.</p>

  <p>"You're an awful idiot, my Hugh, aren't you?" she said at length. "And you
  have given us such a lot of trouble. But I shall quite miss you, and all our
  happy little times together." She laughed gently, and glanced at the clock.
  "They ought to be here fairly soon," she remarked. "Hadn't we better get him
  out of sight?"</p>

  <p>Peterson nodded, and between them they pushed Drummond into the
  bathroom.</p>

  <p>"You see, my friend," remarked Peterson affably, "it is necessary to get
  you out of the hotel without arousing suspicion. A simple little matter, but
  it is often the case that one trips up more over simple matters than over
  complicated ones."</p>

  <p>He was carefully inserting a pin into his victim's leg as he spoke, and
  watching intently for any sign of feeling.</p>

  <p>"Why, I remember once," he continued conversationally, "that I was so
  incredibly foolish as to replace the cork in a bottle of prussic acid after I
  had&mdash;er&mdash;compelled a gentleman to drink the contents. He was in bed
  at the time, and everything pointed to suicide, except that confounded cork.
  I mean, would any man, after he's drunk sufficient prussic acid to poison a
  regiment, go and cork up the empty bottle? It only shows how careful one must
  be over these little matters."</p>

  <p>The girl put her head round the door. "They're here," she remarked
  abruptly, and Peterson went into the other room, half closing the door. And
  Drummond, writhing impotently, heard the well-modulated voice of the Reverend
  Theodosius.</p>

  <p>"Ah, my dear friend, my very dear old friend! What joy it is to see you
  again. I am greatly obliged to you for escorting this gentleman up
  personally."</p>

  <p>"Not at all, sir, not at all! Would you care for dinner to be served up
  here?"</p>

  <p>Someone to do with the hotel, thought Drummond, and he made one final
  despairing effort to move. He felt it was his last chance, and it
  failed&mdash;as the others had done before. And it seemed to him that the
  mental groan he gave must have been audible, so utterly beyond hope did he
  feel. But it wasn't, no sound came from the bathroom to the ears of the
  courteous sub-manager.</p>

  <p>"I will ring later if I require it," Peterson was saying in his gentle,
  kindly voice. "My friend, you understand, is still on a very strict diet, and
  he comes to me more for spiritual comfort than for bodily. But I will ring
  should I find he would like to stay."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir."</p>

  <p>And Drummond heard the door close, and knew that his last hope had
  gone.</p>

  <p>Then he heard Peterson's voice again, sharp and incisive. "Lock the door.
  You two&mdash;get Drummond. He's in the bathroom."</p>

  <p>The two men he had previously seen entered, and carried him back into the
  sitting-room, where the whole scheme was obvious at a glance. Just getting
  out of an ordinary invalid's chair was a big man of more or less the same
  build as himself. A thick silk muffler partially disguised his face, a soft
  hat was pulled well down over his eyes, and Drummond realised that the
  gentleman who had been wheeled in for spiritual comfort would not be wheeled
  out.</p>

  <p>The two men pulled him out of his chair, and then, forgetting his
  condition, they let him go, and he collapsed like a sack of potatoes on the
  floor, his legs and arms sprawling in grotesque attitudes.</p>

  <p>They picked him up again, and not without difficulty they got him into the
  other man's overcoat; and finally they deposited him in the invalid's chair,
  and tucked him up with the rug.</p>

  <p>"We'll give it half an hour," remarked Peterson, who had been watching the
  operation. "By that time our friend will have had sufficient spiritual
  solace; and until then you two can wait outside. I will give you your full
  instructions later."</p>

  <p>"Will you want me any more, sir?" The man whose place Drummond had taken
  was speaking.</p>

  <p>"No," said Peterson curtly. "Get out as unostentatiously as you can. Go
  down by the stairs and not by the lift."</p>

  <p>With a nod he dismissed them all, and once again Drummond was alone with
  his two chief enemies.</p>

  <p>"Simple, isn't it, my friend?" remarked Peterson. "An invalid arrives, and
  an invalid will shortly go. And once you've passed the hotel doors you will
  cease to be an invalid. You will become again that well-known young man about
  town&mdash;Captain Hugh Drummond&mdash;driving out of London in his
  car&mdash;a very nice Rolls, that new one of yours&mdash;bought, I think,
  since we last met. Your chauffeur would have been most uneasy when he missed
  it but for the note you've left him, saying you'll be away for three
  days."</p>

  <p>Peterson laughed gently as he stared at his victim. "You must forgive me
  if I seem to gloat a little, won't you?" he continued. "I've got such a large
  score to settle with you, and I very much fear I shan't be in at the death. I
  have an engagement to dine with an American millionaire, whose wife is
  touched to the heart over the sufferings of the starving poor in Austria. And
  when the wives of millionaires are touched to the heart, my experience is
  that the husbands are generally touched to the pocket."</p>

  <p>He laughed again even more gently and leaned across the table towards the
  man who sat motionless in the chair. He seemed to be striving to see some
  sign of fear in Drummond's eyes, some appeal for mercy. But if there was any
  expression at all it was only a faint mocking boredom, such as Drummond had
  been wont to infuriate him with during their first encounter a year before.
  Then he had expressed it in words and actions, now only his eyes were left to
  him, but it was there all the same. And after a while Peterson snarled at him
  viciously.</p>

  <p>"No, I shan't be in at the death, Drummond, but I will explain to you the
  exact programme. You will be driven out of London in your own car, but when
  the final accident occurs you will be alone. It is a most excellent place for
  an accident, Drummond&mdash;most excellent. One or two have already taken
  place there, and the bodies are generally recovered some two or three days
  later&mdash;more or less unrecognisable. Then when the news comes out in the
  evening papers to-morrow I shall be able to tell the police the whole sad
  story. How you took compassion on an old clergyman and asked him to lunch,
  and then went out of London after your charming young wife&mdash;only to meet
  with this dreadful end. I think I'll even offer to take part in the funeral
  service. And yet&mdash;no, that is a pleasure I shall have to deny myself.
  Having done what I came over to do, Drummond, rather more expeditiously than
  I thought likely, I shall return to my starving children in Vienna. And, do
  you know what I came over to do, Drummond? I came over to smash the Black
  Gang&mdash;and I came over to kill you&mdash;though the latter could have
  waited."</p>

  <p>Peterson's eyes were hard and merciless, but the expression of faint
  boredom still lingered in Drummond's. Only too well did he realise now that
  he had played straight into his enemy's hands, but he was a gambler through
  and through, and not by the quiver of an eyelid did he show what he felt.
  Right from the very start the dice had been loaded in Peterson's favour owing
  to that one astounding piece of luck in getting hold of Phyllis. It hadn't
  even been a fight&mdash;it had been a walk-over. And the cruel part of it was
  that it was not through any mistake of Drummond's. It was a fluke pure and
  simple&mdash;an astounding fluke&mdash;a fluke which had come off better than
  many a carefully-thought-out scheme. If it hadn't been for that he would
  never have come to Peterson's sitting-room at all; he would never have been
  doped; he wouldn't have been sitting helpless as a log while Peterson put
  down his cards one after the other in cold triumph.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it could have waited. Captain Drummond&mdash;that second object of
  mine. I assure you that it was a great surprise to me when I realised who the
  leader of the Black Gang was&mdash;a great surprise and a great pleasure. To
  kill two birds, so to speak, with one stone, saves trouble; to accomplish two
  objects in one accident is much more artistic. So the Black Gang loses its
  leader, the leader loses his life, and I regain my diamonds. Eminently
  satisfactory, my friend, eminently. And when your dear wife returns from the
  country&mdash;if she does&mdash;well, Captain Drummond, it will be a very
  astute member of Scotland Yard who will associate her little adventure with
  that benevolent old clergyman, the Reverend Theodosius Longmoor, who recently
  spent two or three days at the Ritz. Especially in view of your kindly
  telephone message to Mr.&mdash;what's his name?&mdash;Mr. Peter Darrell?" He
  glanced at his watch and rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I fear that that is all the spiritual consolation that I can give you
  this evening, my dear fellow," he remarked benignly. "You will understand,
  I'm sure, that there are many calls on my time. Janet, my love "&mdash;he
  raised his voice&mdash;"our young friend is leaving us now. I feel sure you'd
  like to say good-bye to him."</p>

  <p>She came into the room, walking a little slowly and for a while she stared
  in silence at Hugh. And it seemed to him that in her eyes there was a gleam
  of genuine pity. Once again he made a frantic effort to speak&mdash;to beg,
  beseech, and implore them not to hurt Phyllis&mdash;but it was useless. And
  then he saw her turn to Peterson.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," she said regretfully, "that it is absolutely necessary."</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," he answered curtly. "He knows too much, and he worries us
  too much."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders and came over to Drummond. "Well, good-bye, mon
  ami," she remarked gently. "I really am sorry that I shan't see you again.
  You are one of the few people that make this atrocious country bearable."</p>

  <p>She patted him on his cheek, and again the feeling that he was dreaming
  came over Drummond. It couldn't be real&mdash;this monstrous nightmare. He
  would wake up in a minute and find Denny standing beside him, and he
  registered a vow that he would go to an indigestion specialist. And then he
  realised that the two men had come back into the room, and that it wasn't a
  dream, but hard, sober fact. The Italian was putting a hat on his head and
  wrapping the scarf round his neck while Peterson gave a series of curt
  instructions to the other man. And then he was being wheeled along the
  passage towards the lift, while the Reverend Theodosius walked solicitously
  beside him, murmuring affectionately in his ear.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, my dear friend&mdash;good-bye," he remarked, after the chair
  had been wheeled into the lift. "It was good of you to come. Be careful,
  liftman, won't you?"</p>

  <p>He waved a kindly hand, and the last vision Drummond had of him before the
  doors closed was of a benevolent old clergyman beaming at him solicitously
  from behind a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles.</p>

  <p>And now came his only chance. Surely there would be someone who would
  recognise him below; surely the hall porter, who in the past had received
  many a tip from him, must realise who he was in spite of the hat pulled down
  over his eyes. But even that hope failed. The elderly party in the invalid's
  chair who had come half an hour ago was now going, and there was no reason
  why the hall porter should suspect anything. He gave the two men a hand
  lifting the chair into a big and very roomy limousine car which Drummond knew
  was certainly not his, and the next instant they were off.</p>

  <p>He could see nothing&mdash;the hat was too far over his eyes. For a time
  he tried to follow where they were going by noting the turns, but he soon
  gave that up as hopeless. And then, after driving for about half an hour, the
  car stopped and the two men got out, leaving him alone. He could hear a lot
  of talking going on, but he didn't try to listen. He was resigned by this
  time&mdash;utterly indifferent; his only feeling was a mild curiosity as to
  what was going to happen next.</p>

  <p>The voices came nearer, and he found himself being lifted out of the car.
  In doing so his hat was pulled back a little so that he could see, and the
  first thing he noticed was his own new Rolls-Royce. They couldn't have
  brought it to the Ritz, he reflected, where it might have been
  recognised&mdash;and an unwilling admiration for the master brain that had
  thought out every detail, and the wonderful organisation that allowed of them
  being carried out, took hold of his mind.</p>

  <p>The men wheeled him alongside his own car; then they lifted him out of his
  chair and deposited him on the back seat. Then the Italian and the other man
  who had been at the Ritz sat down one on each side of him, while a third man
  took the wheel.</p>

  <p>"Look slippy, Bill," said the big man beside him. "A boat will be coming
  through about half-past nine."</p>

  <p>A boat! What was that about a boat? Were they going to send him out to
  sea, then, and let him drown? If so, what was the object of getting his own
  car? The hat slipped forward again, but he guessed by some of the flaring
  lights he could dimly see that they were going through slums. Going eastward
  Essex way, or perhaps the south side of the river towards Woolwich. But after
  a time he gave it up: it was no good wondering&mdash;he'd know for certain
  soon enough. And now the speed was increasing as they left London behind
  them. The headlights were on, and Hugh judged that they were going about
  thirty-five miles an hour. And he also guessed that it was about forty-five
  minutes before they pulled up, and the engine and lights were switched off.
  The men beside him got out, and he promptly rolled over into a corner, where
  they left him lying.</p>

  <p>"This is the place to wait," he heard the Italian say. "You go on, Franz,
  to the corner, and when it's ready flash your torch. You'll have to stand on
  the running-board. Bill, and steer till he's round the corner into the
  straight. Then jump off&mdash;no one will see you behind the headlights. I'm
  going back to Maybrick Tower."</p>

  <p>And then he heard a sentence which drove him impotent with fury, and again
  set him struggling madly to move.</p>

  <p>"The girl's there. We'll get orders about her in the morning." There was
  silence for a while; then he heard Bill's voice. "Let's get on with it.
  There's Franz signalling. We'll have to prop him up on the steering-wheel
  somehow."</p>

  <p>They pulled Drummond out of the back of the car, and put him in the
  driver's seat.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't matter if he does fall over at the last moment. It will look as
  if he'd fainted, and make the accident more probable," said the Italian, and
  Bill grunted.</p>

  <p>"Seems a crime," he muttered, "to smash up this peach of a car." He
  started the engine and switched on the headlights; then he slipped her
  straight into third speed and started. He was on the running-board beside the
  wheel, steering with one hand and holding on to Drummond with the other. As
  they rounded the corner he straightened the car up and opened the throttle.
  Then he jumped off, and Drummond realised the game at last.</p>

  <p>A river was in front&mdash;a river spanned by a bridge which swung open to
  let boats go through. And it was open now. He had a dim vision of a man
  waving wildly; he heard the crash as the car took the guarding gate, and then
  he saw the bonnet dip suddenly; there was a rending, scraping noise
  underneath him as the framework hit the edge; an appalling splash&mdash;and
  silence.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15">XV. &mdash; IN WHICH HUGH DRUMMOND ARRIVES AT MAYBRICK
     HALL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Two things saved Drummond from what was practically certain
  death&mdash;the heavy coat he was wearing, and the fact that he rolled
  sideways clear of the steering-wheel as soon as the man let go of him with
  his hand. Had he remained behind the wheel he must infallibly have gone to
  the bottom with the car, and at that point where the river narrowed to come
  through the piers of the bridge the water was over twenty feet deep. He had
  sufficient presence of mind to take a deep breath as the car shot downwards;
  then he felt the water close over his head. And if before his struggles to
  move had been fierce&mdash;now that the end seemed at hand they became
  desperate. The desire to get clear&mdash;to give one kick with his legs and
  come to the surface roused him to one superhuman effort. He felt as if the
  huge heave he gave with his legs against the floorboards must send him flying
  to the top; afterwards he realised that this vast effort had been purely
  mental&mdash;the actual physical result had been practically negligible. But
  not quite, it had done something, and the coat did the rest.</p>

  <p>With that one last supreme throw for his life his mind had overcome the
  effects of the poison to the extent of forcing his legs to give one spasmodic
  little kick. He floated clear of the car, and slowly&mdash;how slowly only
  his bursting lungs could testify&mdash;the big coat brought him to the
  surface. For a moment or two he could do nothing save draw in deep gulps of
  air; then he realised that the danger was not yet past. For he couldn't
  shout, he could do nothing save float and drift, and the current had carried
  him clear of the bridge out of sight of those on top. And his mind was quite
  clear enough to realise that the coat which had saved him, once it became
  sodden would just as surely drown him.</p>

  <p>He could see men with lanterns on the bridge; he could hear them shouting
  and talking. And then he saw a boat come back from the ship that had passed
  through just before he went over the edge in his car. Surely they'd pull
  downstream to look for him, he thought in an agony of futile anger; surely
  they couldn't be such fools as to go on pulling about just by the bridge when
  it was obvious he wasn't there. But since they thought that he was at the
  bottom in his car, and blasphemous language was already being wafted at them
  by the skipper of the vessel for the useless delay, with a sinking heart
  Drummond saw the boat turn round and disappear up-stream into the darkness.
  Men with lanterns still stood on the bridge, but he was far beyond the range
  of their lights, and he was drifting farther every minute. It was just a
  question of time now&mdash;and it couldn't be very long either. He could see
  that his legs had gone down well below the surface, and only the air that
  still remained in the buttoned-up part of his overcoat kept his head out and
  his shoulders near the top. And when that was gone&mdash;the end. He had done
  all he could; there was nothing for it now but to wait for the inevitable
  finish. And though he had been credibly informed that under such
  circumstances the whole of a man's life passes in rapid review before him,
  his sole and only thought was an intense desire to get his hands on Peterson
  again.</p>

  <p>For a while he pictured the scene with a wealth of pleasant detail, until
  a sudden change in his immediate surroundings began to take place. At first
  he could not realise what had happened; then little by little it began to
  dawn on him what had occurred. Up to date the water in which he floated had
  seemed motionless to him; he had been drifting in it at exactly the same
  velocity as the current. And now, suddenly, he saw that the water was going
  past him. For a moment or two he failed to understand the significance of the
  fact; then wild hope surged up in his mind. For a time he stared fixedly at
  the bridge, and the hope became a certainty. He was not drifting any farther
  from it; he was stationary; he was aground. He could feel nothing; he could
  see nothing&mdash;but the one stupendous fact remained that he was aground.
  Life took on another lease&mdash;anything might happen now. If only he could
  remain there till the morning they would see him from the bridge, and there
  seemed no reason why he shouldn't. The water still flowed sluggishly past
  him, broken with the faintest ripple close to his head. So he reasoned that
  it must be very shallow where he was, and being an incurable optimist, he
  resumed, with even fuller details, his next meeting with Peterson.</p>

  <p>But not for long. Starting from his waist and spreading downwards to his
  feet and outwards through his shoulders to his hands there slowly began to
  creep the most agonising cramp. The torture was indescribable, and the sweat
  dripped off his forehead into his eyes. And gradually it dawned on him that
  the effects of the poison were wearing off. Sensation was returning to his
  limbs; even through his agony he could feel that he was resting against
  something under the water. Then he heard a strange noise, and realised that
  was he himself groaning with the pain. The use of his voice had come back. He
  spoke a sentence aloud, and made certain.</p>

  <p>And then Drummond deliberately decided on doing one of those things which
  Peterson had always failed to legislate for in the past. Ninety-nine men out
  of a hundred would have shouted themselves hoarse under such circumstances;
  not so Drummond. Had he done so a message would have reached Peterson in just
  so long as it took a trunk call to get through; the man called Franz was
  still assiduously helping the gate-keeper on the bridge. And the Reverend
  Theodosius Longmoor and his little Janet would have vanished into the night,
  leaving no traces behind them.</p>

  <p>Which all flashed through Drummond's mind as the cramp took and racked
  him, and the impulse to shout grew stronger and stronger. Twice he opened his
  mouth to hail the men he could see not three hundred yards away&mdash;to give
  a cry that would bring a boat post-haste to his rescue; twice he stopped
  himself with the shout unuttered. A more powerful force was at work within
  him than mere pain&mdash;a cold, bitter resolve to get even with Carl
  Peterson. And it required no great effort of brain to see that that would be
  more easily done if Peterson believed he had succeeded. Moreover if he
  shouted there would be questions asked. The police would inevitably come into
  the matter, demanding to know why he adopted such peculiar forms of amusement
  as going into twenty feet of water in a perfectly good motor-car. And all
  that would mean delay, which was the last thing he wanted. He felt tolerably
  certain that, for all his apparent confidence, Peterson was not going to stop
  one minute longer in the country than was absolutely necessary.</p>

  <p>So he stayed where he was, in silence&mdash;and gradually the cramp passed
  away. He could turn his head now, and with eyes that had grown accustomed to
  the darkness he saw what had happened. On each side of him the river flowed
  past smoothly, and he realised that by a wonderful stroke of luck he had
  struck a small shoal. Had he missed it&mdash;had he floated by on either
  side&mdash;well, Peterson's plan would have succeeded.</p>

  <p>"Following the extraordinary motor accident reported in our previous
  issue, we are now informed that the body of the unfortunate driver has been
  discovered some three miles from the scene of the tragedy. He was drowned,
  and had evidently been dead some hours."</p>

  <p>Drummond smiled grimly to himself as he imagined the paragraphs in the
  papers. His nerves were far too hardened to let his narrow escape worry him
  for an instant, and he felt an unholy satisfaction in thinking of Peterson
  searching the early specials and the late extras for that little item of
  news.</p>

  <p>"I'd hate you to be disappointed, my friend," he muttered to himself, "but
  you'll have to be content with the coat and hat. The body has doubtless
  drifted farther on and will be recovered later."</p>

  <p>He took off his hat, and let it drift away; he unbuttoned his overcoat and
  sent it after the hat. Then letting himself down into the deep water, he swam
  noiselessly towards the bank.</p>

  <p>A little to his surprise he found that his legs and arms felt perfectly
  normal&mdash;a trifle stiff perhaps, but beyond that the effects of the
  poison seemed to have worn off completely. Beyond being very wet he appeared
  to have suffered no evil results at all, and after he'd done "knees up" on
  the bank for five minutes to restore his circulation he sat down to consider
  his plans.</p>

  <p>First, Phyllis at Maybrick Hall. He must get at her somehow, and, even if
  he couldn't get her away, he must let her know she would be all right. After
  that things must look after themselves; everything would depend on
  circumstances. Always provided that those circumstances led to the one great
  goal&mdash;Peterson. Once Phyllis was safe, everything was subservient to
  that.</p>

  <p>A church clock nearby began to toll the hour, and Drummond counted the
  strokes. Eleven o'clock&mdash;not two hours since he had gone over the
  bridge&mdash;and it felt like six. So much the better, it gave him so many
  more hours of darkness, and he wanted darkness for his explorations at
  Maybrick Hall. And it suddenly dawned on him that he hadn't the faintest idea
  where the house was.</p>

  <p>It might have deterred some men; it merely made Drummond laugh. If he
  didn't know, he'd find out&mdash;even if it became necessary to pull someone
  out of bed and ask. The first thing to do was to get back to the spot where
  the car had halted, and to do that he must go across country. Activity was
  diminishing on the bridge, but he could still see lanterns dancing about, and
  the sudden appearance of a very wet man might lead to awkward questions. So
  he struck off in the direction he judged to be right&mdash;moving with that
  strange, cat&mdash;like silence which was a never-ceasing source of
  wonderment even to those who knew him best.</p>

  <p>No man ever heard Drummond coming, and very few ever saw him until it was
  too late, if he didn't intend that they should. And now, in utterly unknown
  country, with he knew not how many undesirable gentlemen about, he was taking
  no risks. Mercifully for him it was a dark night&mdash;just such a night in
  fact as he would have chosen, and as he passed like a huge shadow from tree
  to tree, only to vanish silently behind a hedge, and reappear two hundred
  yards farther on, he began to feel that life was good. The joy of action was
  in his veins; he was going to get his hands on somebody soon, preferably the
  Italian or the man who called himself Franz. For Bill he had a sneaking
  regard; Bill at any rate could appreciate a good car when he saw one. The
  only trouble was that he was unarmed, and an unarmed man can't afford to stop
  and admire the view in a mix up. Not that the point deterred him for a
  moment, it only made him doubly cautious. He must see without being seen; he
  must act without being heard. Afterwards would be a different matter.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he stiffened and crouched motionless behind a bush. He had heard
  voices and the sound of footsteps crunching on the gravel.</p>

  <p>"No good waiting any more," said the man whom he recognised as Franz.
  "He's dead for a certainty, and they can't pull him out till to-morrow.
  Couldn't have gone better. He swayed right over just as the car took the
  gates, and the bridge-keeper saw it. Think he fainted&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Their voices died away in the distance, and Drummond came out from behind
  the bush. He stepped forward cautiously and found himself confronted with a
  high wire fence. Through it he could see a road along which the two men must
  have been walking. And then through a gap in the trees he saw a light in the
  window of a house. So his first difficulty was solved. The man called Franz
  and his companion could have but one destination in all
  probability&mdash;Maybrick Hall. And that must be the house he could see
  through the trees, while the road on the other side of the fence was the
  drive leading up to it.</p>

  <p>He gave them half a minute or so; then he climbed through the fence. It
  was a fence with horizontal strands of thick wire, about a foot apart, and
  the top strand was two feet above Drummond's head. An expensive fence, he
  reflected; an unusual fence to put round any property of such a sort. An
  admirable fence for cattle in a corral because of its strength, but for a
  house and grounds&mdash;peculiar, to say the least. It was not a thing of
  beauty; it afforded no concealment, and it was perfectly simple to climb
  through. And because Drummond had been trained in the school which notices
  details, even apparently trivial ones, he stood for a moment or two staring
  at the fence, after he had clambered through. It was the expense of the thing
  more than anything else that puzzled him. It was new&mdash;that was obvious,
  and after a while he proceeded to walk along it for a short way. And another
  peculiar thing struck him when he came to the first upright. It was an iron
  T-shaped post, and each strand of wire passed through a hole in the bottom
  part of the T. A perfectly simple and sound arrangement, and, but for one
  little point, just the type of upright one would have expected to find in
  such a fence. Round every hole was a small white collar, through which each
  strand of wire passed, so that the wires rested on the collars, and not on
  the holes in the iron uprights. Truly a most remarkable fence, he reflected
  again&mdash;in fact, a thoroughly eccentric fence. But he got no farther than
  that in his thoughts; the knowledge which would have supplied him with the
  one clue necessary to account for that fence's eccentricity of appearance was
  not his. The facts he could notice; the reason for the facts was beyond him.
  And after a further examination he shrugged his shoulders and gave it up.
  There were bigger things ahead of him than a mere question of fencing, and,
  keeping in the shadow of the shrubs which fringed each side of the drive, he
  crept silently towards the house.</p>

  <p>It was a low, rambling type of building covered as far as he could see
  with ivy and creepers. There were only two stories, and Hugh nodded his
  satisfaction. It made things simpler when outside work was more than likely.
  For a long time he stood in the shadow of a big rhododendron bush, carefully
  surveying every possible line of approach and flight, and it was while he was
  balancing up chances that he gradually became aware of a peculiar noise
  proceeding from the house. It sounded like the very faint hum of an aeroplane
  in the far distance, except that every two or three seconds there came a
  slight thud. It was quite regular, and during the four or five minutes whilst
  he stood there listening there was no variation in the monotonous rhythm.
  Thud: thud: thud&mdash;faint, but very distinct, and all the time the gentle
  whirring of some smooth-running, powerful engine.</p>

  <p>The house was in darkness save for one room on the ground floor, from
  which the light was streaming. It was empty, and appeared to be an ordinary
  sitting-room. And, as a last resort, Hugh decided he would go in that way, if
  outside methods failed. But to start with he had no intention of entering the
  house; it struck him that the odds against him were unnecessarily large.</p>

  <p>He retreated still farther into the shadow, and then quite clear and
  distinct the hoot of an owl was heard in the silent garden. He knew that
  Phyllis would recognise the call if she heard it; he knew that she would give
  him some sign if she could. And so he stood and waited, eagerly watching the
  house for any sign of movement. But none came, and after a pause of half a
  minute he hooted again. Of course it was possible that she was a room facing
  the other way, and he had already planned his line of advance round to the
  back of the house. And then, just as he was preparing to skirt round and
  investigate he saw the curtains of one of the upper rooms shake and open
  slightly. Very faintly he repeated the call, and to his joy he saw a head
  poked through between them. But he was taking no chances, and it was
  impossible to tell to whom the head belonged. It might be Phyllis, and on the
  other hand it might not. So once again he repeated the call, barely above his
  breath, and then he waited for some answer.</p>

  <p>It came almost at once; his own name called very gently, and he hesitated
  no more. He was across the lawn in a flash and standing under her window, and
  once again he heard her voice tense with anxiety. "Is that you, Hugh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, darling, it's me right enough," he whispered back. "But there's no
  time to talk now. I want you to jump on to the flowerbed. It's soft landing,
  and it won't hurt you."</p>

  <p>"But I can't, old man," she said, with a little catch in her breath.
  "They've got me lashed up with a steel chain."</p>

  <p>"They've got you lashed up with a steel chain," repeated Hugh stupidly.
  "The devil they have; the devil they have!" And his voice was shaking a
  little with cold, concentrated fury. "All right, kid," he went on after a
  moment; "if you can't come to me, I must come to you. We'll soon deal with
  that chain."</p>

  <p>He glanced into the room underneath hers and saw that it looked like a
  drawing-room. The windows seemed easy to force if necessary, but he decided
  first of all to try the ivy outside. But it was useless for a man of his
  weight. Just at the bottom it supported him, but as soon as he started to
  climb it gave way at once. Twice he got up about six feet, twice he fell back
  again as the ivy broke away from the wall. And after the second attempt he
  looked up at the anxious face of his wife above.</p>

  <p>"No go, darling," he muttered. "And I'm afraid of making too much noise.
  I'm going to try and force this window."</p>

  <p>By a stroke of luck they had not taken his clasp-knife, and by a still
  greater stroke of luck he found that the catch on the window had been broken,
  and that it proved even easier to open than he had thought. He stepped back
  and looked up.</p>

  <p>"I'm coming in, kid," he whispered. "Do you know where the stairs
  are?"</p>

  <p>"Just about the middle of the house, old man. And listen. I can't quite
  reach the door to open it, but I've got my parasol and I can tap on it so
  that you'll know which it is."</p>

  <p>"Right," he answered. "Keep your tail up." The next moment he had vanished
  into the drawing-room. And now he noticed that that strange noise which he
  had heard while standing on the lawn was much louder. As he cautiously opened
  the door and peered into the passage the very faint hum became a steady
  drone, while with each successive thud the floorboards shook a little.</p>

  <p>The passage was in darkness, though light was shining from under some of
  the doors. And as he crept along in search of the stairs he heard voices
  proceeding from one of the rooms he passed. Evidently a fairly populous
  household, it struck him, as he tested the bottom stair with his weight to
  see if it creaked. But the staircase was old and solid, and the stair carpet
  was thick, and at the moment Hugh was not disposed to linger. Afterwards the
  house seemed to promise a fairly fruitful field for investigation; at present
  Phyllis was all that mattered. So he vanished upwards with the uncanny
  certainty of all his movements at night, and a moment later he was standing
  on the landing above.</p>

  <p>It was a long, straight corridor, a replica of the one below, and he
  turned in the direction in which he knew her room must lie. And he had only
  taken a couple of steps when he stopped abruptly, peering ahead with eyes
  that strove to pierce the darkness. For it seemed to him that there was
  something in the passage&mdash;something darker than its surroundings. He
  pressed against the wall absolutely motionless, and as he stood there with
  every sense alert, and his arms hanging loosely forward ready for any
  emergency, he heard a tapping on one of the doors just ahead of him. It was
  Phyllis signalling with her parasol as she had said, and he took a step
  forward. And at that moment something sprang out of the darkness, and he
  found himself fighting for his life.</p>

  <p>For a second or two he was at a disadvantage, so completely had he been
  taken by surprise, then the old habits returned. And not a moment too soon;
  he was up against an antagonist who was worthy of him. Two hands like iron
  hooks were round his neck, and the man who gets that grip first wins more
  often than not. His own hands shot out into the darkness, and then for the
  first time in his life he felt a stab of fear. For he couldn't reach the
  other man: long though his arms were, the other man's were far longer, and as
  his hands went along them he could feel the muscles standing out like steel
  bars. He made one supreme effort to force through to his opponent's throat
  and it failed; with his superior reach he could keep his distance. Already
  Drummond's head was beginning to feel like bursting with the awful pressure;
  round his throat, and he knew he must do something at once or lose. And just
  in time he remembered his clasp-knife. It went against his grain to use it;
  never before had he fought an unarmed man with a weapon&mdash;and as far as
  he could tell this man was unarmed. But it had to be done and done
  quickly.</p>

  <p>With all his force he stabbed sideways at the man's left arm. He heard a
  snarl of pain, and the grip of one of the hands round his throat relaxed. And
  now the one urgent thing was to prevent him shouting for help. Like a flash
  Drummond was on him, one hand on his mouth and the other gripping his throat
  with the grip he had learned from Osaki the Jap in days gone by, and had
  never forgotten. And because he was fighting to kill now he wasted no time.
  The grip tightened; there was a dreadful worrying noise as the man bit into
  his thumb&mdash;then it was over. The man slipped downwards on to the floor,
  and Drummond stood drawing in great mouthfuls of air.</p>

  <p>But he knew there was no time to lose. Though they had fought in silence,
  and he could still hear the monotonous thud and the beat of the engine, at
  any moment someone might come upstairs. And to be found with a dead man at
  one's feet in a strange house is not the best way of securing a hospitable
  welcome. What to do with the body&mdash;that was the first insistent point.
  There was no time for intricate schemes; it was a question of taking risks
  and chancing it. So for a moment or two he listened at the door of the room
  opposite that on which he had heard Phyllis tapping, and from which the man
  had sprung at him&mdash;then he gently opened it. It was a bedroom and empty,
  and without further hesitation he dragged his late opponent in, and left him
  lying on the floor. By the dim light from the uncurtained window, he could
  see that the man was almost deformed, so enormous was the length of his arms.
  They must have been six inches longer than those of an average man, and were
  almost as powerful as his own. And as he saw the snarling, ferocious face
  upturned to his, he uttered a little prayer of thanksgiving for the presence
  of his clasp-knife. It had been altogether too near a thing for his
  liking.</p>

  <p>He closed the door and stepped across the passage, and the next moment
  Phyllis was in his arms.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were never coming, old man," she whispered. "I was afraid
  the brutes had caught you."</p>

  <p>"I had a slight difference of opinion with a warrior outside your door,"
  said Hugh, grinning. "Quite like old times."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear," she said, with sudden anxiety in her voice, "you're
  sopping wet."</p>

  <p>"Much water has flowed under the bridge, my angel child, since I last saw
  you, and I've flowed with it." He kissed her on the right side of her mouth,
  then on the left for symmetry, and finally in the middle for luck. Then he
  grew serious. "No time for hot air now, old thing; let's have a look at this
  jolly old chain effect of yours. Once we're out of here, you shall tell me
  everything and I'll eat several pounds of mud for having been such an
  unmitigated idiot as to let these swine get hold of you."</p>

  <p>He was examining the steel chain as he spoke, and gradually his face grew
  grave. He didn't seem to have gained much after all by breaking in; Phyllis
  was just as much a prisoner as ever. The chain, which was about six feet
  long, was fastened at one end to a big staple in the wall and at the other to
  a bracelet which encircled his wife's right wrist. And the bracelet could
  only be opened with a key. Any idea of breaking the chain or pulling out the
  staple was so preposterous as not to be worth even a moment's thought; so
  everything depended on the bracelet. And when he came to examine it more
  carefully he found that it had a Yale lock.</p>

  <p>He sat down on the edge of the bed, and she watched him anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Can't you get it undone, boy?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Not if I stopped here till next Christmas, darling," he answered
  heavily.</p>

  <p>"Well, get out of the window and go for the police," she implored.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he said still more heavily, "I had, as I told you, a little
  difference of opinion with the gentleman outside the door&mdash;and he's very
  dead." She caught her breath sharply. "A nasty man with long arms who
  attacked me. It might be all right, of course&mdash;but I somehow feel that
  this matter is beyond the local constable, even if I could find him. You see,
  I don't even know where we are." He checked the exclamation of surprise that
  rose to her lips. "I'll explain after, darling, let's think of this now. If
  only I could get the key; if only I knew where it was even."</p>

  <p>"A foreigner came in about an hour ago," answered his wife. "He had it
  then. And he said he'd come again to-night."</p>

  <p>"He did, did he?" said Hugh slowly. "I wonder if it's my friend the
  Italian. Anyway, kid, it's the only chance. Did he come alone last time?"</p>

  <p>"Yes: I don't think there was anyone with him. I'm sure there wasn't."</p>

  <p>"Then we must chance it," said Hugh. "Say something; get him into the room
  and then leave him to me. And if for any reason he doesn't come I'll have to
  leave you here and raise the gang."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't it be safer, boy, to do that now?" she said imploringly.
  "Suppose anything happened to you."</p>

  <p>"Anything further that happens to me to-night, old thing," he remarked
  grimly, "will be as flat as a squashed pancake compared to what's happened
  already."</p>

  <p>And then because she saw his mind was made up, and she knew the futility
  of arguing under those conditions, she sat on the bed beside him to wait. For
  a while they sat in silence listening to the monotonous thudding noise which
  went ceaselessly on; then because he wanted to distract her mind he made her
  tell him what had happened to her. And in disjointed whispers, with his arm
  round her waist, she pieced together the gaps in the story. How the man had
  come about the electric light, and then had offered to fetch her a taxi he
  knew already from Denny. She had got in, never suspecting anything, and told
  him to drive to the Ritz&mdash;and almost at once she had begun to feel
  faint. Still she suspected nothing, until she tried to open one of the
  windows. But it wouldn't open, and the last thing she remembered before she
  actually fainted was tapping on the glass to try to draw the driver's
  attention. Then when she came to, she found to her horror that she was not
  alone. A man was in the car with her, and they were out of London in the
  country. Both windows were wide open, and she asked him furiously what he was
  doing in her car. He smiled, and remarked that so far he was not aware he had
  sold it, but he was always open to an offer. And it was then that she
  realised for the first time exactly what had happened.</p>

  <p>The man told her quite frankly that she hadn't fainted at all, but had
  been rendered unconscious by a discharge of gas down the speaking-tube; that
  acting under orders he was taking her to a house in the country where she
  would have to remain for how long he was unable to say, and further if she
  made a sound or gave any trouble he would gag her on the spot.</p>

  <p>Hugh's arm tightened round her waist, and he cursed fluently under his
  breath.</p>

  <p>"And what happened when you got here, darling?" he asked as she
  paused.</p>

  <p>"They brought me straight up here, and tied me up," she answered. "They
  haven't hurt me&mdash;and they've given me food, but I've been
  terrified&mdash;simply terrified&mdash;as to what they were going to do
  next." She clung to him, and he kissed her reassuringly. "There's a man below
  with red hair and a straggling beard, who came and stared at me in the most
  horrible way. He was in his shirt sleeves and his arms were all covered with
  chemical stains."</p>

  <p>"Did he touch you?" asked Hugh grimly.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;he just looked horrible," she said, with a shudder. "And then he
  repeated the other man's threat&mdash;the one who had been in the
  car&mdash;that if I shouted or made any fuss he'd lash me up and gag me. He
  spoke in a sort of broken English&mdash;and his voice never seemed to rise
  above a whisper."</p>

  <p>She was trembling now, and Hugh made a mental note of another gentleman on
  whom he proposed to lay hands in the near future. Red hair and a straggling
  beard should not prove hard to recognise.</p>

  <p>He glanced at the watch on Phyllis's wrist, and saw that it was very
  nearly one o'clock. The noise of the engine was still going monotonously on;
  except for that the house seemed absolutely silent. And he began to wonder
  how long it would be wise to continue the vigil. Supposing no one did come;
  supposing somebody came who hadn't got the key; supposing two or three of
  them came at the same time. Would it be better, even now, to drop through the
  window&mdash;and try to find a telephone or the police? If only he knew where
  he was; it might take him hours to find either at that time of night. And his
  whole being revolted at the idea of leaving Phyllis absolutely defenceless in
  such a house.</p>

  <p>He rose and paced softly up and down the room trying to think what was the
  best thing to do. It was a maddening circle whichever way he looked at it,
  and his fists clenched and unclenched as he tried to make up his mind. To go
  or to wait; to go at once or to stop in the hope that one man would come up
  and have the key on him. Common sense suggested the first course; something
  far more powerful than common sense prompted the latter. He could not and
  would not leave Phyllis alone. And so he decided on a compromise. If when
  daylight came no one had been up to the room, he would go; but he would wait
  till then. She'd feel safer once the night was over, and in the dawn he would
  be able to find his way outside more easily.</p>

  <p>And he was just going to tell Phyllis what he had decided, when he heard a
  sound that killed the words on his lips. A door had opened below, and men's
  voices came floating up the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Lie down, darling," he breathed in her ear, "and pretend to be
  asleep."</p>

  <p>Without a word she did as he told her, while Hugh tiptoed over towards the
  door. There were steps coming up the stairs, and he flattened himself against
  the wall&mdash;waiting. The period of indecision was passed; unless he was
  very much mistaken the time of action had arrived. How it would pan
  out&mdash;whether luck would be in, or whether luck would fail was on the lap
  of the gods. All he could do was to hit hard and if necessary hit often, and
  a tingle of pure joy spread over him. Even Phyllis was almost forgotten at
  the moment; he had room in his mind for one thought only&mdash;the man whose
  steps he could hear coming along the passage.</p>

  <p>There was only one of them, he noted with a sigh of relief&mdash;but for
  all that silence would be essential. It would take time to find the key; it
  would take even longer to get Phyllis free and out of the house. So there
  must be no risk of an alarm whatever happened.</p>

  <p>The steps paused outside the door, and he heard a muttered ejaculation in
  Italian. It was his own particular friend of the motor right enough, and he
  grinned gently to himself. Apparently he was concerned over something, and it
  suddenly dawned on Drummond that it was the absence from duty of the long-
  armed bird that was causing the surprise. In the excitement of the moment he
  had forgotten all about him, and for one awful second his heart stood still.
  Suppose the Italian discovered the body before he entered the room, then the
  game was up with a vengeance. Once the alarm was given he'd have to run the
  gauntlet of the whole crowd over ground he didn't know.</p>

  <p>But his fears were groundless; the non-discovery of the watcher by the
  door took the Italian the other way. His first thought was to make sure that
  the girl was safe, and he flung open the door and came in. He gave a grunt of
  satisfaction as he saw her lying on the bed; then like a spitting cat he
  swung round as he felt Drummond's hand on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"E pericoloso sporgersi," muttered Hugh pleasantly, recalling the only
  Italian words he knew.</p>

  <p>"Dio mio!" stammered the other, with trembling lips. Like most southerners
  he was superstitious, and to be told that it was dangerous to lean out of the
  window by a man whom he knew to be drowned was too much for him. It was a
  ghost; it could be nothing else, and his knees suddenly felt strangely
  weak.</p>

  <p>"You didn't know I was a linguist, did you?" continued Hugh, still more
  pleasantly; and with every ounce of weight in his body behind the blow, he
  hit the Italian on the point of the jaw. Without a sound the man crumpled up
  and pitched on his face.</p>

  <p>And now there was not a moment to be lost. At any moment one of his pals
  might come upstairs, and everything depended on speed and finding the key.
  Hugh shut the door and locked it; then feverishly he started to search
  through the Italian's pockets. Everything up to date had panned out so
  wonderfully that he refused to believe that luck was going to fail him now,
  and sure enough he discovered the bunch in one of the unconscious man's
  waistcoat pockets. There were four of them, and the second he tried was the
  right one. Phyllis was free, and he heard her give a little sob of pure
  excitement.</p>

  <p>"You perfectly wonderful boy!" she whispered, and Hugh grinned.</p>

  <p>"We'll hurl floral decorations afterwards, my angel," he remarked. "Just
  at the moment it seems a pity not to replace you with someone."</p>

  <p>He heaved the Italian on to the bed, and snapped the steel bracelet on to
  his arm. Then he slipped the keys into his own pocket, and crossed to the
  window. The engine was still humming gently; the thudding noise was still
  going on; nothing seemed in any way different. No light came from the room
  below them, everything had worked better than he had dared to hope. He had
  only to lower Phyllis out of the window, and let her drop on to the
  flower-bed and then follow himself. After that it was easy.</p>

  <p>"Come along, darling," he said urgently, "I'm going to lower you out
  first&mdash;then I'll follow. And once we're down, you've got to trice up
  your skirts and run like a stag across the lawn till we're under cover of
  those bushes. We aren't quite out of the wood yet."</p>

  <p>They were not indeed. It was just as Phyllis let go, and he saw her pick
  herself up and dart across the lawn, that he heard a terrific uproar in the
  house below, and several men came pounding up the stairs. There were excited
  voices in the passage outside, and for a moment he hesitated, wondering what
  on earth had caused the sudden alarm. Then realising that this was no time
  for guessing acrostics, he vaulted over the window-sill himself, and lowered
  himself to the full extent of his arms. Then he too let go and dropped on to
  the flower-bed below. And it was as he was picking himself up, preparatory to
  following Phyllis&mdash;whom he could see faintly across the lawn waiting for
  him, that he heard someone in the house shout an order in a hoarse voice.</p>

  <p>"Switch on the power at once, you damned fool; switch it on at once!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16">XVI. &mdash; IN WHICH THINGS HAPPEN AT MAYBRICK
     HALL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Had the Italian come up five minutes sooner&mdash;a minute
  even&mdash;all would have been well. As it was, at the very moment when
  Drummond's crashing blow took him on the point of the jaw with mathematical
  precision, another mathematical law began to operate elsewhere&mdash;the law
  of gravity. Something fell from a ceiling on to a table in the room below
  that ceiling, even as in days gone by an apple descended into the eye of the
  discoverer of that law.</p>

  <p>The two men seated in the room below the ceiling in question failed to
  notice it at first. They were not interested in mathematics but they were
  interested in their conversation. One was the red-headed man of whom Phyllis
  had spoken: the other was a nondescript type of individual who looked like an
  ordinary middle-class professional man.</p>

  <p>"Our organisation has, of course, grown immensely," he was saying. "Our
  Socialist Sunday Schools, as you may know, were started twenty-five years
  ago. A very small beginning, my friend, but the result now would stagger you.
  And wishy-washy stuff was taught to start with too; now I think even you
  would be satisfied."</p>

  <p>Something splashed on the table beside him, but he took no notice.</p>

  <p>"Blasphemy, of course&mdash;or rather what the Bourgeois call
  blasphemy&mdash;is instilled at once. We teach them to fear no God; we drive
  into them each week that the so-called God is merely a weapon of the
  Capitalist class to keep them quiet, and that if it had not that effect they
  would see what a machine-gun could do. And, Yulowski, it is having its
  effect. Get at the children has always been my motto&mdash;for they are the
  next generation. They can be moulded like plastic clay; their parents, so
  often, are set in a groove. We preach class hatred&mdash;and nothing but
  class hatred. We give them songs to sing&mdash;songs with a real catchy tune.
  There's one very good one in which the chorus goes:</p>

  <p style="text-indent:0"><i>"Come, workers, sing a rebel song, a song of love
  and hate,</i><br>
  <i>Of love unto the lowly and of hatred to the great.</i>"</p>

  <p>He paused to let the full effect of the sublime stanza sink in, and again
  something splashed on to the table. Yulowski nodded his head
  indifferently.</p>

  <p>"I admit its value, my friend," he remarked in a curious husky whisper.
  "And in your country I suppose you must go slowly. I fear my inclinations
  lead towards something more rapid and&mdash;er&mdash;drastic. Sooner or later
  the Bourgeois must be exterminated all the world over. On that we are agreed.
  Why not make it sooner as we did in Russia? The best treatment for any of the
  Capitalist class is a bayonet in the stomach and a rifle butt on the
  head."</p>

  <p>He smiled reminiscently, a thin, cruel smile, and once again there came an
  unheeded splash.</p>

  <p>"I have heard it said," remarked the other man, with the faintest
  hesitation, "that you yourself were responsible in Russia for a good many of
  them."</p>

  <p>The smile grew more pronounced and cruel. "It was I, my friend, who
  battered out the brains of two members of the Arch Tyrant's family. Yes,
  I&mdash;I who sit here." His voice rose to a sort of throaty shout and his
  eyes gleamed. "You can guess who I mean, can't you?"</p>

  <p>"Two girls," muttered the other, recoiling a little in spite of
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Two&mdash;" The foul epithet went unuttered; Yulowski was staring
  fascinated at the table. "Holy Mother! what's that?"</p>

  <p>His companion swung round, and every vestige of colour left his face. On
  the table was a big red pool, and even as he watched it there came another
  splash and a big drop fell into it.</p>

  <p>"Blood!" he stammered, and his lips were shaking. "It's blood." And then
  he heard the Russian's voice, low and tense.</p>

  <p>"Look at the ceiling, man, look at the ceiling."</p>

  <p>He stared upwards and gave a little cry of horror. Slowly spreading over
  the white plaster was a great crimson stain, whilst from a crack in the
  middle the steady drip fell on to the table..</p>

  <p>It was Yulowski who recovered himself first; he was more used to such
  sights than his companion.</p>

  <p>"There's been murder done," he shouted hoarsely, and dashed out of the
  room. Doors were flung open, and half a dozen men rushed up the stairs after
  him. There was no doubt which the room was, and headed by Yulowski they
  crowded in&mdash;only to stop and stare at what lay on the floor.</p>

  <p>"It's the Greek," muttered one of them. "He was guarding the girl. And
  someone has severed the main artery in his arm."</p>

  <p>With one accord they dashed across the passage to the room where Phyllis
  had been. In a second the door was broken in, and they saw the unconscious
  Italian lying on the bed.</p>

  <p>"The Black Gang," muttered someone fearfully, and Yulowski cursed him for
  a cowardly swine. And it was his hoarse voice that Drummond heard shouting
  for the power to be switched on, as he turned and darted across the lawn.</p>

  <p>Completely ignorant of what had taken place, he was just as ignorant of
  what was meant by switching on the power. His one thought now was to get away
  with Phyllis. A start meant everything, and at the best he couldn't hope for
  a long one. With his arm through hers he urged her forward, while behind him
  he heard a confused shouting which gradually died away under the peremptory
  orders of someone who seemed to be in command. And almost subconsciously he
  noticed that the thudding noise had ceased; only the faint humming of the
  engine broke the silence.</p>

  <p>Suddenly in front of him he saw the fence which had caused him to wonder
  earlier in the evening. It was just the same in this part as it had been in
  the other, but he wasn't concerned with speculations about it now. The only
  thing he was thankful for was that it was easy to get through.</p>

  <p>He was not five feet from it, when it happened&mdash;the amazing and at
  the moment inexplicable thing. For months after he used to wake in the night
  and lie sweating with horror at the nearness of the escape. For it would have
  been Phyllis who would have gone through first; it would have been Phyllis,
  who&mdash;But it did happen&mdash;just in time.</p>

  <p>He saw a dark shape dart across the open towards the fence, an animal
  carrying something in its mouth. It reached the fence, and the next instant
  it bounded an incredible height in the air, only to fall backwards on to the
  ground and lie motionless almost at Drummond's feet. It was so utterly
  unexpected that he paused instinctively and stared at it. It was a fox, and
  the fowl it had been carrying lay a yard away. It lay there rigid and
  motionless, and completely bewildered he bent and touched it, only to draw
  back his hand as if he'd been stung. A sharp stabbing pain shot up his arm,
  as if he'd had an electric shock&mdash;and suddenly he understood, and with a
  cry of fear he dragged Phyllis back just in time.</p>

  <p>The brain moves rapidly at times; the inherent connection of things takes
  place in a flash. And the words he had used to the Italian, "E pericoloso
  sporgersi," took him back to Switzerland, where the phrase is written on
  every railway carriage. And in Switzerland, you may see those heavy steel
  pylons with curved pointed hooks to prevent people climbing up, and red bands
  painted with the words 'Danger de mort'. Live wires there are at the top,
  carried on insulators&mdash;even as the fence wires were carried through
  insulators in the uprights.</p>

  <p>Danger de mort. And the fox had been electrocuted. That was what the man
  had meant by shouting for the power to be switched on. And as he stood there
  still clutching Phyllis's arm, and shaken for the moment out of his usual
  calm, there came from the direction of the house, the deep-throated baying of
  a big hound.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Hugh?" said Phyllis in an agonised whisper. With terrified
  eyes she was staring at the body of the fox, stiff and rigid in death, and
  with its jaws parted in a hideous snarl.</p>

  <p>And again there came from the direction of the house a deep-throated
  bay.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly she realised that her husband was speaking&mdash;quietly,
  insistently. Only too well did he know the danger: only too well did he know
  that never before in his life had the situation been so tight. But no sign of
  it showed on his face: not a trace of indecision appeared in his voice. The
  position was desperate, the remedy must be desperate too.</p>

  <p>"We can't climb through the fence, dear," he was saying calmly. "You see
  they've switched an electric current through the wires, and if you touch one
  you'll be electrocuted. Also they seem to have turned an unpleasant little
  animal into the garden, so we can't stay here. At least&mdash;you can't. So
  I'm going to throw you over the top."</p>

  <p>In an agony of fear she clung to him for a moment: then as she saw his
  quiet, set face she pulled herself together and smiled. There was no time for
  argument now: there was no time for anything except instant action. And being
  a thoroughbred, she was not going to hinder him by any weakness on her part.
  Of fear for herself she felt no trace: her faith and trust in her husband was
  absolute. And so she stood there silently waiting while he measured height
  and distance with his eye.</p>

  <p>Of his ability to get her over he felt no doubt: but when a mistake means
  death to the woman he loves a man does not take risks. "Come, dear," he said
  after a moment's pause. "Put your knees close up to your chin, and try to
  keep like a ball until you feel yourself falling."</p>

  <p>She doubled herself up and he picked her up. One hand held both her
  feet&mdash;the other gripped the waistband at the back of her skirt. Once he
  lifted her above his head to the full extent of his arms to free his muscles:
  then he took a little run and threw her up and forward with all his strength.
  And she cleared the top strand by two feet....</p>

  <p>She landed unhurt in some bushes, and when she had scrambled to her feet
  she realised he was speaking again&mdash;imperatively, urgently. "Get the
  gang, darling: somehow or other get the gang. I'll try and get you a good
  start. But&mdash;hurry."</p>

  <p>The next instant he had disappeared into the undergrowth, and only just in
  time. A huge hound running mute had dashed into the clearing where a second
  or two before they had been standing, and was cautiously approaching the dead
  fox. She stared at it fascinated, and then with a little cry of terror she
  pulled herself together and ran. She had forgotten the fence that was between
  them: for the moment she had forgotten everything except this huge brute that
  looked the size of a calf. And the hound, seeing the flutter of her dress,
  forgot things too. A dead fox could wait, a living human was better fun by
  far. He bounded forward: gave one agonised roar as he hit the fence, and
  turning a complete somersault lay still. And as Phyllis stumbled blindly on,
  she suddenly heard Hugh's cheerful voice from the darkness behind her,
  apparently addressing the world at large.</p>

  <p>"Roll up! roll up! roll up! one fox: one Pomeranian: one fowl. No charge
  for admittance. Visitors are requested not to touch the exhibits."</p>

  <p>And then loud and clear the hoot of an owl thrice repeated. It was a
  message for her, she knew&mdash;not a senseless piece of bravado: a message
  to tell her that he was all right. But the call at the end was the urgent
  call of the gang, and though he was safe at the moment she knew there was no
  time to be lost. And, with a little prayer that she would choose the right
  direction, she broke into the steady run of the girl who beagles when she
  goes beagling, and doesn't sit on the top of a hill and watch. Hugh had never
  let her down yet: it was her turn now.</p>

  <p>To what extent it was her turn, perhaps it was as well that she did not
  realise. Even Drummond, hidden in the undergrowth just by the clearing where
  lay the body of the hound, was ignorant of the nature of the odds against
  him. He had not the slightest idea how many men there were in the
  house&mdash;and while it remained dark he didn't much care. In the dark he
  felt confident of dealing with any number, or at any rate of eluding them. It
  was the thing of all others that his soul loved&mdash;that grim fighting at
  night, when a man looks like a trunk of a tree, and the trunk of a tree looks
  like a man. It was in that that he was unequalled&mdash;superb: and the
  inmates of Maybrick Hall would have been well advised to have stayed their
  hands till the light came. Then the position, in military parlance, could
  have been taken without loss. An unarmed man is helpless when he can be
  seen.</p>

  <p>But since the inmates were ignorant of what they were up against, they
  somewhat foolishly decided on instant action. They came streaming across in a
  body in the track of the dead hound, and by so doing they played straight
  into the hands of the man who crouched in the shadows close by them. He
  listened for one moment to the babel of tongues of every nationality, and
  decided that a little more English might adjust the average. So without a
  sound he faded away from his hiding-place, and emerged from the undergrowth
  ten yards nearer the house. Then with his collar turned up, and his shoulders
  hunched together, he joined the group. And a man-eating tiger in their midst
  would have been a safer addition to the party.</p>

  <p>Certain it is that the next quarter of an hour proved a period of such
  terror for the inmates of Maybrick Hall that at the end of that time they
  reassembled at the house and flatly refused to budge, despite the threats and
  curses of the red-headed Russian. For Drummond had heard the original
  orders&mdash;to form a line of beaters and shoot on sight&mdash;and had
  smiled gently to himself in the darkness. There is always an element of
  humour in stalking the stalkers, and when the line formed up at intervals of
  two or three yards the quarry was behind it. Moreover the quarry was angry,
  with the cold, steady rage of a powerful man who realises exactly what he is
  up against. Shoot on sight was the order, and Drummond accepted the
  terms.</p>

  <p>Slowly the line of shadowy men moved forward through the undergrowth, and
  creeping behind them came the man they were out to kill. And gradually he
  edged nearer and nearer to the wire fence, until he was following the outside
  man of the line. He saw him pause for a moment peering round a bush, with his
  revolver ready in his hand. And then the terror started. The beater next to
  the victim had a fleeting vision of a huge black object springing through the
  darkness: a muttered curse and a gurgle&mdash;and a dreadful strangled
  scream. And the outside beater was no more. He had been hurled against the
  live-wire fence as if he was a child&mdash;and the exhibits had been
  increased by one.</p>

  <p>With a hoarse cry of fear the man who had been next to him turned and ran
  towards the house, only to find himself seized from behind with a grip of
  iron. It was Franz, and as he stared into the face of the man whom he knew to
  be drowned he gave a squawk like a trapped rabbit. But there was nothing
  ghostly about the hands round his neck, and as he felt himself being rushed
  towards the fence of death he began to struggle furiously. But Drummond was
  mad at the moment, and though Franz was a powerful man he might have saved
  himself the trouble. A terrific blow hit him on the face, and with a grunt he
  fell back against the fence. The exhibits were increased by two, and through
  the darkness rang a cheerful laugh, followed by the hooting of an owl.</p>

  <p>And now the line was broken, and men were crashing about in all directions
  shouting hoarsely. Experts of the Red Terror they might be&mdash;butcherers
  of women and children whose sole fault lay in the fact that they washed: that
  night they found themselves up against a terror far worse than even their
  victims had ever experienced. For they, poor wretches, knew what was coming:
  the men who ran shouting through the undergrowth did not. Here, there, and
  everywhere they heard the hooting of an owl: they formed into bunches of twos
  and threes for protection, they blazed away with compressed-air revolvers at
  harmless rhododendron bushes, and sometimes at their own pals. And every now
  and then a great black figure would leap silently out of the darkness on to
  some straggler: there would be a bellow of fear and pain&mdash;followed by an
  ominous silence, which was broken a second or two later by the hooting of an
  owl twenty yards away.</p>

  <p>Occasionally they saw him&mdash;a dim, fleeting shadow, and once four of
  them fired at him simultaneously. But luck was with him, and though two holes
  were drilled in his coat Drummond was not hit himself. His quiet laugh came
  suddenly from behind them, and even as they swung round cursing, one of them
  collapsed choking with a bullet through his chest. It was the first time he
  had used his first victim's revolver, but the target was too tempting to be
  let off. And at last they could stand it no longer. They had no idea how many
  men they were up against, and a complete panic set in. With one accord they
  rushed for the house, and a mocking peal of laughter followed them as they
  ran. For Drummond had gambled on that, and he had won. In the position of
  knowing that every man was his enemy, he had been at an advantage over the
  others, who were never sure who was a friend. For a while he listened to the
  flood of lurid blasphemy which came from the open windows of the room into
  which they had crowded: then he dodged along the bushes and looked in. For a
  moment he was sorely tempted to fire: in fact he went so far as to draw a
  bead on the red-headed Russian, who was gesticulating furiously. Then his
  hand dropped to his side: shooting into the brown was not his idea of the
  game. And at the same moment, the lights were switched off in the room: it
  had evidently struck someone inside that the position was a trifle insecure.
  The talking ceased abruptly, and with a faint grin on his face Drummond swung
  round and vanished into the deepest part of the undergrowth. It was necessary
  to do some thinking.</p>

  <p>He had got the start he wanted for Phyllis, which was all to the good, but
  he was as far as ever himself from getting out. There was still the fence to
  be negotiated if he was to escape, and common sense told him that there
  wasn't the remotest chance of the current having been switched off. And
  incidentally it didn't much matter whether it had been or not, since the only
  way of finding out for certain was to touch one of the wires&mdash;a thing he
  had not the faintest intention of doing. He could still hear the steady
  thrumming of the engine, and so the fence was out of the question..</p>

  <p>Delving into memories of the past, when he had sat at the feet of the
  stinks master at his school, he tried to remember some of the gems of wisdom,
  anent electricity, which had fallen from his lips. But since his sole
  occupation during such lectures had been the surreptitious manufacture of
  sulphuretted hydrogen from a retort concealed below his desk, he finally gave
  up the attempt in despair. One thing was certain; the fence must be
  continuous. From knowledge gained from the sparking plugs of his car, he knew
  that a break in the circuit was fatal. Therefore, there could be no break in
  the fence which encircled the house. And if that was so&mdash;how about the
  drive? How did the drive pass through the fence? There must be a break there,
  or something capable of forming a break. A motor-car will not go over an
  eight-foot fence, and he had seen the wheel tracks of a car quite clearly on
  the drive earlier in the evening.</p>

  <p>Yes&mdash;he would try the gate. It was imperative to get away, and that
  as soon as possible. When dawn came, and the first faint streaks were already
  beginning to show in the east, he realised that he would be at a hopeless
  disadvantage. Moreover the absolute silence which now reigned after the
  turmoil and shouting of the last few minutes struck him as ominous. And
  Drummond was far too clever a man to underrate his opponents. The panic had
  been but a temporary affair; and the panic was now over.</p>

  <p>He began to thread his way swiftly and silently in the direction of the
  drive. Not for a second did he relax his caution, though he felt tolerably
  certain that all his opponents were still inside the house. Only too well did
  he know that the greatest danger often lies when things seem safest. But he
  reached the edge of the drive without incident, and started to skirt along it
  away from the house. At last he saw the gate, and turned deeper into the
  undergrowth. He wanted to examine it at leisure, before making up his mind as
  to what he would do. As far as he could see from the outline he could make
  out against the road, it was an ordinary heavy wooden gate, such as may be
  seen frequently at the entrance to small country houses.</p>

  <p>A tiny lodge lay on one side: the usual uncared-for undergrowth on the
  other. He could see the wire fence coming to the gatepost on each side; he
  could see that the strands were bunched together at the gate as telegraph
  wires are bunched when they pass underneath a bridge on a railway line. And
  it was while he was cogitating on the matter that he saw a man approaching
  from the other side. He came up to the gate, climbed over it with the utmost
  nonchalance, and turned into the little lodge. And Hugh noticed that as he
  climbed he was careful to avoid the second horizontal from the ground. At
  last it seemed to him that everything was clear. Contact was made through the
  latch; the current passed along the wires which were laid on the top of the
  second horizontal from the ground, and thence to the continuation of the
  fence on the other side. Anyway, whatever the electrical device, if this man
  could climb the gate in safety&mdash;so could he. There was a risk&mdash;a
  grave risk. It meant going out into the open; it meant exposing himself for a
  considerable period. But every moment he delayed the light grew better, and
  the risk became worse. And it was either that or waiting in the garden till
  daylight made his escape impossible. And still he hung back. Men who knew
  Hugh Drummond well often said that he had a strange sixth sense which enabled
  him to anticipate danger, when to others with him everything seemed perfectly
  safe. Well&mdash;nigh fantastic stories were told of him by men who had
  accompanied him on those unofficial patrols he had carried out in No Man's
  Land whenever his battalion was in the line, and frequently when it wasn't.
  And as he stood there motionless as a statue, with only the ceaseless
  movement of his eyes to show his strained attention, that sixth sense of his
  warned him, and continued warning him insistently. There was danger: he felt
  it, he knew it&mdash;though where it lay he couldn't tell.</p>

  <p>And then suddenly he again saw a man approaching from the other
  side&mdash;a man who climbed the gate with the utmost nonchalance and turned
  into the little lodge. He, too, carefully avoided the second horizontal from
  the ground, but Drummond was not paying any attention to the gate now. Once
  again his sixth sense had saved him, for it was the same man who had climbed
  over the first time. And why should a man adopt such a peculiar form of
  amusement, unless he was deliberately acting as a decoy? He had disappeared
  into the lodge, only to leave it again by a back entrance&mdash;and in an
  instant the whole thing was clear. They had gambled on his going to the gate:
  they had gambled on his having a dart for it when he saw the gate was safe to
  climb. And he smiled grimly when he realised how nearly they had won their
  bet.</p>

  <p>Suddenly his eyes riveted themselves on the little hedge in front of the
  lodge. Something had stirred there: a twig had snapped. And the smile grew
  more grim as he stared at the shadow. Up to date it was the gate that had
  occupied his attention&mdash;now he saw that the hedge was alive with men.
  And after a while he began to shake gently with laughter. The idea of the
  perspiring sportsman trotting in and out of the back door, to show off his
  particular line in gates, while a grim bunch of bandits lay on their stomachs
  in the dew, hoping for the best, appealed to his sense of humour. For the
  moment the fact that he was now hopelessly trapped did not trouble him: his
  whole soul went out to the painstaking gate-hopper. If only he would do it
  again&mdash;that was his one prayer. And sure enough about five minutes later
  he hove in sight again, stepping merrily and brightly along the road.</p>

  <p>His nonchalance was superb: he even hummed gently to show his complete
  disdain for gates in general and this one in particular. And then Drummond
  plugged him through the leg. He felt that it would have been a crime to end
  the career of such a bright disposition: so he plugged him through the fleshy
  part of the leg. And the man's howl of pain and Drummond's raucous bellow of
  laughter broke the silence simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Not the least merry interlude, he reflected, in an evening devoted to fun
  and games, as he took cover rapidly behind a big tree. For bullets were
  whistling through the undergrowth in all directions, as the men who had been
  lying under cover of the hedge rose and let fly. And then quite abruptly the
  shooting died away, and Drummond became aware that a car was approaching. The
  headlights were throwing fantastic shadows through the bushes, and outlined
  against the glare he could see the figures of his opponents. Now was his
  chance, and with the quickness of the born soldier he acted on it. If the car
  was to come in they must open the gate; and since nothing blinds anyone so
  completely as the dazzle of strong headlights, he might be able to slip out
  unseen, just after the car had passed through. He skirted rapidly to one side
  out of the direct beam: then he made his way towards the lodge, keeping well
  out on the flank. And from a concealed position under the cover of the little
  house he awaited developments.</p>

  <p>The man he had shot through the leg was unceremoniously bundled on to the
  grass beside the drive, whilst another man climbed the gate and went up to
  the car, which had come to a standstill ten yards or so away. Drummond heard
  the sound of a window being lowered, and an excited conversation: then the
  man who had approached the car stepped back again into the glare of the
  headlights.</p>

  <p>"Open the gate," he said curtly, and there was a sardonic grin on his
  face.</p>

  <p>And now Drummond was waiting tensely. If he was to bring it off it would
  be a matter of seconds and half-seconds. Little by little he edged nearer to
  the drive, as a man with what appeared to be a huge glove on his hand
  approached the gate. There was a bright flash as he pressed down the catch
  and the circuit was broken, and at the same moment the headlights on the car
  went out, while an inside light was switched on.</p>

  <p>And Drummond stopped dead&mdash;frozen in his tracks. The car was moving
  forward slowly, and he could see the people inside clearly. One was Count
  Zadowa&mdash;alias Mr. Atkinson; one was the Reverend Theodosius Longmoor.
  But the other&mdash;and it was the third person on whom his eyes were fixed
  with a hopeless feeling of impotent rage&mdash;the other was Phyllis herself.
  The two men were holding her in front of them, so that to fire was an
  impossibility, and Peterson was smiling out of the window with the utmost
  benevolence. Then they were past him, and he watched the red tail-lamp
  disappearing up the drive, while the gate was shut behind them. Another
  flashing spark stabbed the darkness; the circuit was complete again. And with
  a feeling of sick, helpless fury, Drummond realised that it had all been
  useless. H was exactly where he had been half an hour before, with the vital
  difference that the events of the last half-hour could not be repeated. He
  was caught: it was the finish. Somehow or other the poor girl must have
  blundered right into the car, and probably asked the occupants for help. She
  wouldn't have known who they were; she'd just stopped the car on spec,
  and...He shook his fists impotently, and at that moment he heard a loud,
  powerful voice which he recognised at once speaking from the direction of the
  house.</p>

  <p>"Unless Captain Drummond comes into the house within five minutes, I shall
  personally kill Mrs. Drummond." And the voice was the voice of Carl
  Peterson.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17">XVII. &mdash; IN WHICH A MURDERER IS MURDERED AT MAYBRICK
     HALL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"You appear to have a wonderful faculty for remaining alive,
  my young friend," remarked Peterson two minutes later, gazing benevolently at
  Drummond over his clerical collar.</p>

  <p>"Principally, Theo, my pet, because you've got such a wonderful faculty
  for making bloomers," answered Drummond affably.</p>

  <p>No trace of the impotent rage he had given way to in the garden showed in
  his face as he spoke; and yet, in all conscience, the situation was desperate
  enough. He was unarmed&mdash;his revolver had been removed from him as he
  entered the house&mdash;and behind his chair stood two men, each with the
  muzzle of a gun an inch off his neck. In another corner sat Phyllis, and
  behind her stood an armed man also. Every now and then his eyes stole round
  to her, and once he smiled reassuringly&mdash;an assurance he was far from
  feeling. But principally his eyes were fixed on the three men who were
  sitting at the table opposite him. In the centre was Carl Peterson, smoking
  the inevitable cigar; and, one on each side of him, sat Count Zadowa and the
  red-headed Russian Yulowski.</p>

  <p>"You can't imagine the pleasant surprise it gave me," Peterson continued
  gently, "when your charming wife hailed my car. So unexpected: so delightful.
  And when I realised that you were running about in our grounds here instead
  of being drowned as that fool No. 10 told me over the telephone...By the way,
  where is No. 10?"</p>

  <p>He turned snarling on the Russian, but it was one of the men behind
  Drummond's chair who answered.</p>

  <p>"He's dead. This guy threw him on the live wires."</p>

  <p>"Is that little Franz?" murmured Hugh Drummond, lighting a cigarette.
  "Yes&mdash;I regret to state that he and I had words, and my impression is
  that he has passed away. Do you mind standing a little farther away?" he
  continued, addressing the men behind him. "You're tickling the back of my
  neck, and it makes me go all goosey."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say," said the Russian in his harsh voice, "that it was
  you and only you outside there?"</p>

  <p>"You have guessed it, Adolph," answered Drummond, speaking mechanically.
  It had seemed to him, suddenly, that, unseen by the others, Phyllis was
  trying to convey some message. "Alone I did it, to say nothing of that
  squib-faced bird upstairs with the long arms. In fact, without wishing to
  exaggerate, I think the total bag is five&mdash;with dear old '<i>pericoloso
  sporgersi</i>' as an 'also ran.'"</p>

  <p>What was she trying to make him understand? And then suddenly she began to
  laugh hysterically, and he half rose from his seat, only to sit down again
  abruptly as he felt the cold ring of a revolver pressed into the nape of his
  neck.</p>

  <p>"Three and two make five," said Phyllis, half laughing and half crying,
  "and one makes six. I worked it out to-night, and it all came right."</p>

  <p>She went on aimlessly for a while in the same strain, till the Russian
  swung round on her with a snarl, and told her to shut her mouth. He was
  talking in low tones to Peterson, and, with one searching look at Hugh, she
  relapsed into silence. There was no hysteria in that look, and his heart
  began to pound suddenly in his excitement. For 3256 Mayfair was the number of
  Peter Darrell's telephone, and she could only mean one thing&mdash;that she
  had got through to Peter before she stopped the car. And if that was so there
  was still hope, if only he could gain time. Time was the essential factor:
  time he must have somehow. And how was he to get it? Not by the quiver of an
  eyelid did the expression on his face change: he still smoked placidly on,
  looking with resigned boredom at the three men who were now conferring
  earnestly together. But his mind was racing madly, as he turned things over
  this way and that. Time: he must gain time.</p>

  <p>If his supposition was right, Carl Peterson was in ignorance of the fact
  that a message had been got through. And in that lay the only chance. Just as
  in Bridge there comes a time when to win the game one must place a certain
  card with one of the opponents; and play accordingly&mdash;so that card must
  be placed in Peterson's hand. If the placing has been done correctly, you
  take your only chance of winning: if the placing is wrong, you lose anyway.
  And so, starting with that as a foundation, he tried to work out the play of
  the hand. Peter Darrell knew, and Peterson was in ignorance of the fact.</p>

  <p>First&mdash;how long did he want? Two hours at least: three if possible.
  To round up all the gang and get cars in the middle of the night would take
  time&mdash;two hours at the very least. Secondly&mdash;and there was the
  crux&mdash;how was he going to get such a respite? For this time he could not
  hope for another mistake. It was the end, and he knew it.</p>

  <p>No trace of mercy showed in the faces of the three men opposite him. He
  caught occasional remarks, and after a while he realised what the matter
  under discussion was. Evidently the redheaded Russian was in favour of
  killing him violently, and at once&mdash;and it was Count Zadowa who was
  advocating caution, while Peterson sat between them listening impassively,
  with his eyes fixed on Drummond.</p>

  <p>"Bayonet the pair of them," snarled Yulowski at length, as if tired of
  arguing the point. "I'll do the job if you're too squeamish, and will bury
  'em both with the rest of the bodies in the grounds somewhere. Who's to know:
  who's to find out?"</p>

  <p>But Count Zadowa shook his head vigorously. "That's just where you're
  wrong, my friend. No one would see you do it more willingly than I&mdash;but
  you've got to remember the rest of his gang."</p>

  <p>His voice died away to a whisper, and Drummond could only catch disjointed
  fragments. "I know the Black Gang," Zadowa was saying. "You don't. And they
  know me." Then he heard the word "accident" repeated several times, and at
  length Yulowski shrugged his shoulders and leaned back in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Have it your own way," he remarked. "I don't care how they're killed, as
  long as they are killed. If you think it's necessary to pretend there has
  been an accident, we'll have an accident. The only point is what sort of an
  accident."</p>

  <p>But Count Zadowa had apparently not got as far as that, and relapsed into
  silence. His powers of imagination were not sufficiently great to supply the
  necessary details, and it was left to Carl Peterson to decide matters.</p>

  <p>"Nothing is easier," he remarked suavely, and his eyes were still fixed on
  Drummond. "We are discussing, my young friend," he continued, raising his
  voice slightly, "the best way of getting rid of you and your charming wife. I
  regret that she must share your fate, but I see no way out of it. To keep her
  permanently about the premises would be too great an inconvenience; and since
  we can't let her go without involving ourselves in unpleasant notoriety, I
  fear&mdash;as I said&mdash;that she must join you. My friend Yulowski wishes
  to bayonet you both, and bury you in the grounds. He has done a lot of that
  sort of thing in his time, and I believe I am right in stating that his hand
  has not lost its cunning since leaving Russia. A little out of practice,
  perhaps: but the result is the same. On the other hand, Count Zadowa, whom
  you know of old, quite rightly points out that there are the members of your
  ridiculous gang, who know about him, and might very easily find out about me.
  And when in a few days your motor-car is hoisted out of the water, and is
  traced by the registration number as being yours, he fears that not only may
  he find things very awkward, but that a certain amount of unenviable and
  undesirable limelight may be thrown on this part of the country, and
  incidentally on this house. You follow our difficulties so far?"</p>

  <p>"With the utmost clarity, Theo," answered Drummond pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"It's always such a pleasure talking to you," continued Peterson. "You're
  so unexpectedly quick on the uptake. Well then&mdash;to proceed. Though it
  will not interfere with me personally&mdash;as I leave England in four
  hours&mdash;it will interfere considerably with my plans if the police come
  poking their noses into this house. We like to hide our light under a bushel,
  Captain Drummond: we prefer to do our little bit unnoticed. So I feel sure
  that you will be only too ready to help us in any way you can, and fall in
  with my suggestion for your decease with goodwill. I have a very warm regard
  for you in so many ways, and I should hate to think that there was any bad
  blood between us at the end."</p>

  <p>"Carl&mdash;my pet&mdash;you'll make me cry in a minute," said Drummond
  quietly. To all outward appearances he was in the same mocking vein as his
  principal enemy, but a little pulse was beginning to hammer in his throat,
  and his mouth felt strangely dry. He knew he was being played with as a mouse
  is played with by a cat, and it was all he could do to stop himself from
  demanding outright to know what was coming. Out of the corner of his eye he
  could see Phyllis sitting very white and still, but he didn't dare to look at
  her direct for fear he might break down. And then, still in the same tone,
  Peterson went on:</p>

  <p>"I knew I could rely on you to meet me. I shall tell Irma when I see her,
  and she will be very touched by your kindness, Drummond&mdash;very touched.
  But to come back to the point. As my friend Zadowa most justly
  observed&mdash;we want an accident: a real good bona-fide accident, which
  will relieve the world of your presence and will bring no scorching glare of
  publicity upon this house or any of my confreres who remain in England. You
  may recall that that was my original idea, only you seem in the most
  extraordinary way to have escaped from being drowned. Still, as far as it
  goes, we have a very good foundation to build on. Your car&mdash;duly
  perceived by the gentleman of limited intelligence who works the
  bridge&mdash;went over the edge. You were duly perceived in it. Strangely
  enough, his eyesight must have been defective&mdash;or else he was so
  flustered by your amazing action that he was incapable of noticing everything
  at such a moment. Because he actually failed to see that your charming wife
  was seated beside you. In the moment of panic when she realised you had
  fainted, she leant forward&mdash;doubtless to try and throw out the clutch.
  Yes "&mdash;his eyes, cold and expressionless, were turned momentarily on
  Phyllis&mdash;"I think that is what she must have done. That accounts for the
  not very intelligent gate-opener failing to see her. But that she was there
  is certain. Because, Captain Drummond, both bodies will be recovered from the
  river the day after to-morrow, shall we say? some two or three miles
  downstream."</p>

  <p>"Your efforts at drowning have not been vastly successful up to date,
  Carl, have they?" said Drummond genially. "Do I understand that we are both
  to be taken out and held under the water, or are you going to use the bath
  here? That is to say "&mdash;and he glanced pointedly at Yulowski&mdash;"if
  such a commodity exists. Or are you again going to experiment with that dope
  of yours?"</p>

  <p>"Wrong on all counts," answered Peterson. "You are far too large and
  strong, my dear Drummond, to be drowned by such rudimentary methods. And it
  is more than likely that even if we attempted to do it, the fact that you
  struggled would be revealed in a post-mortem examination. And that would
  spoil everything, wouldn't it? No longer would it appear to be an accident:
  Count Zadowa's masterly argument would all have been wasted. Why&mdash;I
  might as well agree at once to Yulowski's suggestion of the bayonet. Pray
  give me credit, my dear young friend, for a little more brains than
  that."</p>

  <p>"I do, Theo: I assure you I do," said Drummond earnestly. "It's only my
  terrible fear that you'll again go and make a hash of it that inspires my
  remarks."</p>

  <p>"Thank you a thousand times," murmured the clergyman gently. He was
  leaning forward, his elbows on the table&mdash;and for the first time
  Drummond understood something of the diabolical hatred which Peterson felt
  for him. He had never shown it before: he was far too big a man ever to
  betray his feeling unnecessarily. But now, as he sat facing him, gently
  rubbing his big white hands together, Drummond understood.</p>

  <p>"Thank you a thousand times," he repeated in the same gentle voice. "And
  since you are so concerned about the matter, I will tell you my plan in some
  detail. I need hardly say that any suggestions you make on any points that
  may strike you will receive my most careful attention. When the car crashed
  into the water it carried you and your wife with it. We have got as far as
  that, haven't we? As it plunged downwards you&mdash;still unconscious from
  your dreadful and sudden fainting fit&mdash;were hurled out. Your wife, in a
  magnificent endeavour to save you, rose in her seat and was hurled out too. I
  think we can safely say that, don't you, seeing that the not too intelligent
  gatekeeper could not have seen the car as it fell?"</p>

  <p>"Go on," said Drummond quietly.</p>

  <p>"Interested, I hope," murmured Peterson. "But don't hesitate to stop me if
  anything is at all obscure. I feel that you have a perfect right to suggest
  any small alterations you like. Well&mdash;to proceed. You were both hurled
  out as the car plunged into the water, and somewhat naturally you were both
  thrown forward. Head foremost, you will note, Drummond, you left the
  car&mdash;and your heads struck the stonework of the opposite pier with
  sickening force, just before you reached the water. In fact, a marked feature
  of the case, when this dreadful accident is reported in the papers, will be
  the force with which you both struck that pier. Your two heads were terribly
  battered. In fact, I have but little doubt that the coroner will decide, when
  your bodies are recovered some few miles downstream&mdash;that you were not
  in reality drowned, but that the terrific impact on the stone pier killed you
  instantly. Do you think it's sound up to date?"</p>

  <p>"I think it's damned unsound," remarked Drummond languidly. "If you
  propose to take me and endeavour to make my head impinge on a stone wall,
  someone is going to get a thick ear. Besides, the bridge isn't open, and even
  your pal, the not too intelligent gate-keeper, might stick in his toes a bit.
  Of course "&mdash;he added hopefully&mdash;"you might say you were doing it
  for the movies. Tell him you're Charlie Chaplin, but that you dressed in such
  a hurry you've forgotten your moustache."</p>

  <p>The red-headed Russian was snarling venomously. "Let me get at him, chief.
  He won't try being funny again."</p>

  <p>"No. I shall be too occupied sprinkling myself with insect powder,"
  retorted Drummond vulgarly. "Why, you lousy brute, if you got at me, as you
  call it, and there wasn't half a battalion of infantry holding guns in my
  head, I'd break your neck with one hand strapped behind my back."</p>

  <p>The Russian half rose to his feet, his teeth bared, and Peterson pulled
  him back into his chair.</p>

  <p>"You'll get your chance in a moment or two, Yulowski," he remarked
  savagely. Then he turned once more on Drummond, and the genial look had
  vanished from his face. "Doubtless your humour appeals to some people; it
  does not to me. Moreover, I am in rather a hurry. I do not propose, Captain
  Drummond, to take you to the bridge and endeavour to make your head impinge
  on a wall, as you call it. There is another far simpler method of producing
  the same result. The impinging will take place in this house. As a soldier
  you should know the result of a blow over the head with the butt of a rifle.
  And I can assure you that there will be no bungling this time. Yulowski is an
  expert in such matters, and I shall stay personally to see that it is done. I
  think we can give a very creditable imitation of what would have happened had
  my little story been true, and to-morrow night&mdash;I see that it is getting
  a little too light now for the purpose&mdash;your two bodies will be carried
  over and dropped in the river. The length of time you will both have been
  dead will be quite correct, within an hour or so&mdash;and everything will be
  most satisfactory for all concerned."</p>

  <p>Drummond passed his tongue over his lips, and despite himself his voice
  shook a little. "Am I to understand," he said after a moment, "that you
  propose to let that man butcher us here&mdash;in this house&mdash;with a
  rifle?"</p>

  <p>"Just so," answered Peterson. "That is exactly what you are to
  understand."</p>

  <p>"You are going to let him bash my wife over the head with a rifle
  butt?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to order him to do so," said Peterson mildly. "And very
  shortly at that. We must not have any mistakes over the length of time you've
  both been dead; I confess it sounds drastic, but I can assure you it will be
  quite sudden. Yulowski, as I told you, is an expert. He had a lot of
  experience in Russia."</p>

  <p>"You inhuman devil!" muttered Drummond dazedly. "You can do what you like
  to me, but for Heaven's sake let her off."</p>

  <p>He was staring fascinated at the Russian, who had risen and crossed to a
  cupboard in the wall. There was something almost maniacal in the look on his
  face&mdash;the look of a savage, brute beast, confronted with the prey it
  desires.</p>

  <p>"Impossible, my dear young friend," murmured Peterson regretfully. "It
  affords me no pleasure to have her killed, but I have no alternative. To see
  you dead, I would cross two continents," he snarled suddenly, "but
  "&mdash;and his voice became normal again&mdash;"only bitter necessity
  compels me to adopt such measures with Phyllis. You see, she knows too much."
  He whispered in Count Zadowa's ear, who rose and left the room, to return
  shortly with half a dozen more men.</p>

  <p>"Yes, she knows too much, and so I fear I cannot let her off. She would be
  able to tell such a lot of most inconvenient things to the police. This house
  is so admirably adapted for certain of our activities that it would be a
  world of pities to draw undesirable attention to it. Especially now that
  Count Zadowa has been compelled to leave his own office, owing entirely to
  your reprehensible curiosity."</p>

  <p>But Drummond was paying no attention to him. His eyes were fixed on the
  Russian, who had come back slowly into the centre of the room, carrying a
  rifle in his hand. It was an ordinary Russian service rifle, and a bayonet
  was fixed in position. Yulowski handled it lovingly, as he stood beside
  Peterson&mdash;and suddenly Count Zadowa turned white and began to tremble.
  To throw a bomb into a room and run for your life is one thing: to sit at a
  table in cold blood and witness a double execution is another. Even
  Peterson's iron nerves seemed a little shaken, and his hand trembled as he
  removed his cigar. But there was no sign of relenting on his face; no sign of
  faltering in his voice as he spoke to the men who had just come into the
  room.</p>

  <p>"In the interests of us all," he remarked steadily, "I have decided that
  it is necessary to kill both the prisoners." He made a sign, and Drummond,
  sitting almost paralysed in his chair, found both his arms gripped, with
  three men hanging on to each.</p>

  <p>"The man," continued Peterson, "has been interfering with our work in
  England&mdash;the work of the Red International. He is the leader of the
  Black Gang, as you probably know; and as you probably do not know, it is he
  and his gang who have been responsible for the mysterious disappearance of
  some of our most trusted workers. Therefore with regard to him there can be
  no second thought: he deserves death, and he must die. With regard to the
  woman, the case is a little different. She has done us no active
  harm&mdash;but she is a member of the bourgeois class, and she in his wife.
  Moreover she knows too much. And so it becomes necessary that she should die
  too. The reason why I am adopting this method of putting them both out of the
  way, is&mdash;as I have already explained to all save you
  newcomers&mdash;that, when the bodies are discovered, the cause of death will
  appear to be accidental. They will both of them seem to the police to have
  gone over the edge of the bridge in the car, and hit their heads on the pier
  opposite. And to-morrow night you will carry the bodies to the river and drop
  them in. And that "&mdash;he resumed his cigar&mdash;"I think is all."</p>

  <p>Yulowski handled his rifle lovingly, and once again his teeth showed in a
  wolfish grin. "Which shall I take first, chief?" he said carelessly.</p>

  <p>"The point is immaterial," returned Peterson. "I think perhaps the
  woman."</p>

  <p>Drummond tried to speak and failed. His tongue was clinging to the roof of
  his mouth: everything in the room was dancing before his eyes. Dimly he saw
  the red-headed brute Yulowski swinging his rifle to test it: dimly he saw
  Phyllis sitting bolt upright, with a calm, scornful expression on her face,
  while two men held her by the arms so that she would not move. And suddenly
  he croaked horribly.</p>

  <p>Then he saw Yulowski put down the rifle and listen intently for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" snapped Peterson irritably.</p>

  <p>"Do you hear the different note to that dynamo?" said Yulowski.</p>

  <p>"What the hell's that got to do with it?" roared Peterson. "Get on with
  it, damn you&mdash;and attend to the dynamo afterwards."</p>

  <p>Yulowski nodded, and picked up his rifle again. "The last time," he said,
  turning on Drummond with a dreadful look of evil in his face, "that this
  rifle was used by me was in a cellar in Russia&mdash;on even more exalted
  people than you. I brought it especially with me as a memento, never thinking
  I should have the pleasure of using it again."</p>

  <p>He swung it over his head, and Drummond shut his eyes&mdash;to open them
  again a moment later, as the door was flung open and a man distraught with
  terror dashed in.</p>

  <p>"The Black Gang!" he shouted wildly. "Hundreds of them&mdash;all round the
  house. They've cut the wires."</p>

  <p>With a fearful curse Peterson leaped to his feet, and the men holding
  Drummond, dumbfounded at the sudden turning of the tables, let go his arms.
  Yulowski stood staring foolishly at the door, and what happened then was so
  quick that none of the stupefied onlookers raised a finger to prevent it.</p>

  <p>With the howl of an enraged beast, Drummond hurled himself on the
  Russian&mdash;blind mad with fury. And when two seconds later a dozen black-
  cowled, black-hooded figures came swarming in through the door, for one
  instant they paused in sheer horror.</p>

  <p>Pinned to the wall with his own bayonet which stuck out six inches beyond
  his back, was a red-headed, red-bearded man gibbering horribly in a strange
  language; whilst creeping towards a benevolent-looking clergyman, who
  crouched in a corner, was a man they scarce recognised as their leader, so
  appalling was the look of malignant fury on his face.</p>

  <p>Carl Peterson was no coward. In the world in which he moved, there were
  many strange stories told of his iron nerve and his complete disregard of
  danger. Moreover Nature had endowed him with physical strength far above the
  average. But now, for perhaps the first time in his life, he knew the meaning
  of stark, abject terror.</p>

  <p>The sinister men in black&mdash;members of that very gang he had come over
  to England to destroy&mdash;seemed to fill the room. Silently, as if they had
  been drilled to it, they disarmed everyone: then they stood round the
  walls&mdash;waiting. No one spoke: only the horrible imprecations of the
  dying Russian broke the silence, as he strove feebly to pull out the rifle
  and bayonet from his chest, which had fixed him to the wall as a dead
  butterfly is fixed in a collection with a pin.</p>

  <p>Peterson had a fleeting vision of a girl with white face and wide, staring
  eyes, beside whom were standing two of the motionless black figures as
  guards&mdash;the girl whom he had just sentenced to a dreadful and horrible
  death, and then his eyes came back again as if fascinated to the man who was
  coming towards him. He tried to shrink farther into his corner, plucking with
  nerveless fingers at his clerical collar&mdash;while the sweat poured off his
  face in a stream. For there was no mercy in Hugh Drummond's eyes: no mercy in
  the great arms that hung loosely forward. And Peterson realised he deserved
  none.</p>

  <p>And then it came. No word was spoken&mdash;Drummond was beyond speech. His
  hands shot out and Peterson felt himself drawn relentlessly towards the man
  he had planned to kill, not two minutes before. It was his turn now to wonder
  desperately if it was some hideous nightmare, even while he struggled
  impotently in his final frenzy with a man whose strength seemed equal to the
  strength of ten. He was choking: the grip on his throat was not human in its
  ferocity. There was a great roaring in his ears, and suddenly he ceased to
  struggle. The glare in Drummond's eyes hypnotised him, and for the only time
  in his life he gave up hope.</p>

  <p>The room was spinning round: the silent black figures, the dying Yulowski,
  the girl&mdash;all seemed merged in one vast jumble of colour growing darker
  and darker, out of which one thing and one thing only stood out clear and
  distinct on his dying consciousness&mdash;the blazing eyes of the man who was
  throttling him. And then, as he felt himself sinking into utter blackness,
  some dim sense less paralysed than the rest seemed to tell him that a change
  had taken place in the room. Something new had come into that whirling
  nightmare that spun round him: dimly he heard a voice&mdash;loud and
  agonised&mdash;a voice he recognised. It was a woman's voice, and after a
  while the grip on his throat relaxed. He staggered back against the wall
  gasping and spluttering, and gradually the room ceased to whirl
  round&mdash;the iron bands ceased to press upon his heart and lungs.</p>

  <p>It was Irma who stood there: Irma whose piteous cry had pierced through to
  his brain: Irma who had caused those awful hands to relax their grip just
  before it was too late. Little by little everything steadied down: he found
  he could see again&mdash;could hear. He still crouched shaking against the
  wall, but he had got a respite anyway&mdash;a breathing-space. And that was
  all that mattered for the moment&mdash;that and the fact that the madness was
  gone from Hugh Drummond's eyes.</p>

  <p>The black figures were still standing there motionless round the walls;
  the Russian was lolling forward&mdash;dead; Phyllis was lying back in her
  chair unconscious. But Peterson had eyes for none of these things: Count
  Zadowa shivering in a corner&mdash;the huddled group of his own mea standing
  in the centre of the room he passed by without a glance. It was on Drummond
  his gaze was fixed: Drummond, who stood facing Irma with an almost dazed
  expression on his face, whilst she pleaded with him in an agony of
  supplication.</p>

  <p>"He ordered that man to brain my wife with a rifle butt," said Drummond
  hoarsely. "And yet you ask for mercy."</p>

  <p>He passed his hand two or three times over his forehead as Irma once again
  broke into wild pleadings; then he turned and stared at Peterson. She stopped
  at last, and still he stared at the gasping clergyman as if making up his
  mind. And, in truth, that was precisely what he was doing. Like most big men
  he was slow to anger, but once his temper was roused it did not cool easily.
  And never before in his life had he been in the grip of such cold, maniacal
  fury as had held him during the last few minutes. Right from the start had
  Peterson deceived him: from the very moment when he had entered his sitting-
  room at the Ritz. He had done his best to murder him, and not content with
  that he had given orders for Phyllis and him to be butchered in cold blood.
  If the Black Gang had not arrived&mdash;had they been half a minute
  later&mdash;it would have been over. Phyllis&mdash;his Phyllis&mdash;would
  have been killed by that arch-devil whom he had skewered to the wall with his
  own rifle. And as the thought took hold of him, his great fists clenched once
  more, and the madness again gleamed in his eyes. For Peterson was the real
  culprit: Peterson was the leader. To kill the servant and not the master was
  unjust.</p>

  <p>He swung round on the cowering clergyman and gripped him once again by the
  throat, shaking him as a terrier shakes a rat. He felt the girl Irma plucking
  feebly at his arm, but he took no notice. In his mind there was room for no
  thought save the fixed determination to rid the world for ever of this
  monstrous blackguard. And still the motionless black figures round the wall
  gave no sign, even when the girl rushed wildly from one to the other
  imploring their aid. They knew their leader, and though they knew not what
  had happened to cause his dreadful rage they trusted him utterly and
  implicitly. Whether it was lawful or not was beside the point: it was just or
  Hugh Drummond would not have done it. And so they watched and waited, while
  Drummond, his face blazing, forced the clergyman to his knees, and the girl
  Irma sank half-fainting by the table.</p>

  <p>But once again Fate was to intervene on Peterson's behalf, through the
  instrumentality of a woman. And mercifully for him the intervention came from
  the only woman&mdash;from the only human being&mdash;who could have
  influenced Drummond at that moment. It was Phyllis who opened her eyes
  suddenly, and, half-dazed still with the horror of the last few minutes,
  gazed round the room. She saw the huddled group of men in the centre: she saw
  the Russian lolling grotesquely forward supported on his own rifle: she saw
  the Black Gang silent and motionless like avenging judges round the walls.
  And then she saw her husband bending Carl Peterson's neck farther and farther
  back, till at any moment it seemed as if it must crack.</p>

  <p>For a second she stared at Hugh's face, and saw on it a look which she had
  never seen before&mdash;a look so terrible, that she gave a sharp, convulsive
  cry.</p>

  <p>"Let him go, Hugh: let him go. Don't do it."</p>

  <p>Her voice pierced his brain, though for a moment it made no impression on
  the muscles of his arms. A slightly bewildered look came into his eyes: he
  felt as a dog must feel who is called off his lawful prey by his master.</p>

  <p>Let him go&mdash;let Carl Peterson go! That was what Phyllis was asking
  him to do&mdash;Phyllis who had stood at death's door not five minutes
  before. Let him go! And suddenly the madness faded from his eyes: his hands
  relaxed their grip, and Carl Peterson slipped unconscious to the
  floor&mdash;unconscious but still breathing. He had let him go, and after a
  while he stepped back and glanced slowly round the room. His eyes lingered
  for a moment on the dead Russian, they travelled thoughtfully on along the
  line of black figures. And gradually a smile began to appear on his
  face&mdash;a smile which broadened into a grin.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly sound advice, old thing," he remarked at length. "Straight from
  the stable. I really believe I'd almost lost my temper."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap18"
     name="chap18">XVIII. &mdash; IN WHICH THE HOME SECRETARY<br>
  IS TAUGHT THE FOX-TROT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It was a week later. In Sir Bryan Johnstone's office two men
  were seated, the features of one of whom, at any rate, were well known to the
  public. Sir Bryan encouraged no notoriety: the man in the street passed him
  by without recognition every time. In fact it is doubtful if many of the
  general public so much as knew his name. But with his companion it was
  different: as a member of several successive Cabinets, his face was almost as
  well known as one or two of the lesser lights in the film industry. And it is
  safe to say that never in the course of a life devoted to the peculiar
  vagaries of politics had his face worn such an expression of complete
  bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"But it's incredible, Johnstone," he remarked for the fiftieth time.
  "Simply incredible."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, Sir John," returned the other, "it is true. I have absolute
  indisputable proof of the whole thing. And if you may remember, I have long
  drawn the Government's attention to the spread of these activities in
  England."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I know," said Sir John Haverton a little testily, "but you have
  never given us chapter and verse like this before."</p>

  <p>"To be perfectly frank with you," answered Sir Bryan, "I didn't realise it
  fully myself until now. Had it not been for the Black Gang stumbling upon
  this house in Essex&mdash;Maybrick Hall&mdash;overpowering the owners and
  putting me on their track, much of this would never have come to light."</p>

  <p>"But who are the members of this Black Gang?" demanded the Cabinet
  Minister.</p>

  <p>Sir Bryan Johnstone gave an enigmatic smile.</p>

  <p>"At the moment, perhaps," he murmured, "that point had better remain in
  abeyance. I may say that in the whole of my official career I have never
  received such a profound surprise as when I found out who the leader of the
  gang was. In due course, Sir John, it may be necessary to communicate to you
  his name; but in the meantime I suggest that we should concentrate on the
  information he has provided us with, and treat him as anonymous. I think you
  will agree that he has deserved well of his country."</p>

  <p>"Damned well," grunted the other, with a smile. "He can have a seat in the
  Cabinet if this is his usual form."</p>

  <p>"I hardly think," returned Sir Bryan, smiling even more enigmatically,
  "that he would help you very much in your proceedings, though he might
  enliven them."</p>

  <p>But the Cabinet Minister was once more engrossed in the report he was
  holding in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Incredible," he muttered again. "Incredible."</p>

  <p>"And yet, as I said before&mdash;the truth," said the other. "That there
  is an organised and well-financed conspiracy to preach Bolshevism in England
  we have known for some time: how well organised it is we did not realise. But
  as you will see from that paper, there is not a single manufacturing town or
  city in Great Britain that has not got a branch of the organisation
  installed, which can if need be draw plentifully on funds from headquarters.
  Where those funds come from is at the present moment doubtful: in my own mind
  I have no doubt that Russia supplies the greater portion. You have in front
  of you there, Sir John "&mdash;he spoke with sudden passion&mdash;"the
  definite proofs of a gigantic attempt at world revolution on the Russian
  plan. You have in front of you there the proofs of the appalling spread of
  the Proletarian Sunday Schools, with their abominable propaganda and their
  avowed attempt to convert the children who attend them to a creed whose
  beginning is destruction and whose end is chaotic anarchy. You have in front
  of you there the definite proofs that 80 per cent of the men engaged in this
  plot are not visionaries, swayed by some grandiloquent scheme of world
  reform&mdash;are not martyrs sacrificing their lives for what seems to them
  the good of the community&mdash;but criminals, and in many cases murderers.
  You have there before you the definite proofs that 80 per cent of these men
  think only of one thing&mdash;the lining of their own pockets, and to carry
  out that object they are prepared utterly to destroy sound labour in this and
  every other country. It's not as difficult as it looks; it's not such a big
  proposition as it seems. Cancer is a small growth compared to the full body
  of the victim it kills: the cancer of one man's tongue will kill a crowd of a
  thousand. We're a free country. Sir John; but the time is coming when freedom
  as we understood it in the past will have to cease. We can't go on as the
  cesspit of Europe, sheltering microbes who infect us as soon as they are
  here. We want disinfecting: we want it badly. And then we want sound
  teaching, with the best representatives of the employers and the best
  representatives of the employed as the teachers. Otherwise you'll get
  this."</p>

  <p>With his finger he flicked a paper towards the Cabinet Minister. "'To
  teach the children the ideal of Revolution&mdash;that should be the primary
  aim of a Proletarian school.'</p>

  <p>"Printed at Maybrick Hall," said Sir Bryan grimly. "And listen to
  this&mdash;a couple of the Ten Proletarian Maxims.</p>

  <p>"'Thou shalt demand on behalf of your class the COMPLETE SURRENDER of the
  CAPITALIST CLASS.'</p>

  <p>"And another:</p>

  <p>"'Thou shalt teach REVOLUTION, for revolution means the abolition of the
  present political state, the end of Capitalism.'"</p>

  <p>He gave a short laugh.</p>

  <p>"That's what they're teaching the children. Destruction: destruction:
  destruction&mdash;and not a syllable devoted to construction. What are they
  going to put in its place? They don't know&mdash;and they don't care&mdash;as
  long as they get paid for the teaching."</p>

  <p>Sir John Haverton nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I must go into all this in detail," he remarked. "But in the meantime you
  have raised my curiosity most infernally about this Black Gang of yours. I
  seem to remember some extraordinary manifesto in the paper&mdash;something to
  do with that damned blackguard Latter, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>Sir Bryan leaned back in his chair and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"There are one or two gaps I haven't filled in myself at the moment," he
  answered. "But I can tell you very briefly what led us to our discoveries at
  that house in Essex of which I spoke to you&mdash;Maybrick Hall. About six
  days ago I received a typewritten communication of a similar type to one or
  two which I had seen before. A certain defect in the typewriter made it clear
  that the source was the same, and that source was the leader of the Black
  Gang. Here is the communication."</p>

  <p>He opened a drawer in his desk, and passed a sheet of paper across to the
  Cabinet Minister.</p>

  <p>"If," it ran, "jolly old McIver will take his morning constitutional to
  Maybrick Hall in Essex, he will find much to interest him in that delightful
  and rural spot. Many specimens, both dead and alive, will be found there, all
  in a splendid state of preservation. He will also find a great many
  interesting devices in the house. Above all, let him be careful of an elderly
  clergyman of beneficent aspect, whose beauty is only marred by a stiff and
  somewhat swollen neck, accompanied by a charming lady who answers to the name
  of Janet. They form the peerless gems of the collection, and were on the
  point of leaving the country with the enclosed packet which I removed from
  them for safe keeping. My modesty forbids me to tell an unmarried man like
  you in what portion of dear Janet's garments this little bag was found, but
  there's no harm in your guessing."</p>

  <p>"What the devil?" spluttered Sir John. "Is it a practical joke?"</p>

  <p>"Far from it," answered the other. "Read to the end."</p>

  <p>"After McIver has done this little job," Sir John read out, "he might like
  a trip to the North. There was an uninhabited island off the West coast of
  Mull, which is uninhabited no longer. He may have everything he finds there,
  with my love.&mdash;The leader of the Black Gang."</p>

  <p>Sir John laid down the paper and stared at the Director of Criminal
  Investigation.</p>

  <p>"Is this the rambling of a partially diseased intellect?" he inquired with
  mild sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort," returned the other shortly. "McIver and ten plain-
  clothes men went immediately to Maybrick Hall. And they found it a very
  peculiar place. There were some fifteen men there&mdash;trussed up like so
  many fowls, and alive. They were laid out in a row in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Enthroned in state, in two chairs at the end, and also trussed hand and
  foot, were the beneficent clergyman and Miss Janet. So much for the living
  ones, with the exception of an Italian, who was found peacefully sleeping
  upstairs, with his right wrist padlocked to the wall by a long chain. I've
  mentioned him last, because he was destined to play a very important part in
  the matter." He frowned suddenly. "A very important part, confound him," he
  repeated. "However, we will now pass to the other specimens. In the grounds
  were discovered&mdash;a dead fowl, a dead fox, a dead hound the size of a
  calf&mdash;and three dead men."</p>

  <p>Sir John ejaculated explosively, sitting up in his chair.</p>

  <p>"They had all died from the same cause," continued the other
  imperturbably&mdash;"electrocution. But that was nothing compared to what
  they found inside. In an upstairs room was a dreadful-looking specimen, more
  like an ape than a man, whose neck was broken. In addition, the main artery
  of his left arm had been severed with a knife. And even that was mild to what
  they found downstairs. Supported against the wall was a red-headed man stone
  dead. A bayonet fixed to a rifle had been driven clean through his chest, and
  stuck six inches into the wall behind him. And on that the body was
  supported."</p>

  <p>"Good heavens!" said Sir John, aghast. "Who had done it?"</p>

  <p>"The leader of the Black Gang had done it all, fighting desperately for
  his own life and that of his wife. One of the men lashed up in the hall
  turned King's Evidence and told us everything. I'm not going to weary you
  with the entire story, because you wouldn't believe it. This man had heard
  everything: had been present through it all. He heard how this leader&mdash;a
  man of gigantic strength&mdash;had thrown his wife over the high live-wire
  fence, just as the hound was on top of them, and the hound dashing after her
  had electrocuted itself. He heard how the girl, rushing blindly through the
  night in an unknown country, had stumbled by luck on the local post office,
  and managed to get a telephone call through to London, where she found the
  rest of the gang assembled and waiting&mdash;their suspicions aroused over
  some message received that evening from the Ritz. Then she left the post
  office and was wandering aimlessly along the road, when a car pulled up
  suddenly in front of her. Inside was a clergyman accompanied by another
  man&mdash;neither of whom she recognised. They offered her a lift, and the
  next thing she knew was that she'd been trapped again, and was back at
  Maybrick Hall. So much this man heard: the rest he saw. The leader of the
  Black Gang and his wife were sentenced to death by the
  clergyman...Clergyman!" Sir Bryan shook his fist in the air. "I'd give a
  year's screw to have laid my hands on that clergyman."</p>

  <p>"He escaped?" cried the other.</p>

  <p>"All in due course," said Sir Bryan. "They were sentenced to death by
  having their brains bashed out with the butt of a rifle&mdash;after which
  they were to be thrown in the river. It was to be made to appear an accident.
  And the man who was to do it was a Russian called Yulowski&mdash;one of the
  men who butchered the Russian Royal family...A devil of the most inhuman
  description. He literally had the rifle raised to kill the girl, when the
  Black Gang, having cut the wire fence, arrived in the nick of time. And it
  was then that the leader of that gang, who had thought he was on the point of
  seeing his wife's brains dashed out, took advantage of the utter confusion
  and sprang on the Russian with a roar of rage. The man who told us stated
  that he had never dreamed such a blow was possible as the rifle thrust which
  pierced clean through the Russian. It split him like a rotten cabbage, and he
  died in three minutes."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear fellow," spluttered the Cabinet Minister, "you can't expect
  me to believe all this. You're pulling my leg."</p>

  <p>"Never farther from it in my life, Haverton," said the other. "I admit it
  seems a bit over the odds, but every word I've told you is gospel. To return
  to the discoveries. McIver found that the house was the headquarters of a
  vast criminal organisation. There were schemes of the most fantastic
  descriptions cut and dried in every detail. Some of them were stupid: some
  were not. I have them all here. This one "&mdash;he glanced through some
  papers on his desk&mdash;"concerns the blowing of a large gap in one of the
  retaining walls of the big reservoir at Staines. This one concerns a
  perfectly-thought-out plot on your life when you go to Beauchamp Hall next
  week. You were to be found dead in your railway carriage."</p>

  <p>"What!" roared Sir John, springing to his feet.</p>

  <p>"It would very likely have failed," said Sir Bryan calmly, "but they would
  have tried again. They don't like you or your views at all&mdash;these
  gentlemen. But those are the least important. From time immemorial wild,
  fanatical youths have done similar things: the danger was far greater and
  more subtle. And perhaps the most dangerous activity of all was what I have
  spoken about already&mdash;Maybrick Hall was the headquarters of these
  poisonous Proletarian Sunday Schools. But in addition to that there was
  forgery going on there on a big scale: money is necessary for their
  activities. There were also long lists of their agents in different parts of
  the country, and detailed instructions for fomenting industrial unrest. But
  you have it all there&mdash;you can read it at your leisure for yourself.
  Particularly I commend to your notice, the series of pamphlets on Ireland,
  and the methods suggested for promoting discord between England and France,
  and England and America."</p>

  <p>Sir Bryan lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"To return to the personal side of it. McIver, engrossed in his search,
  paid very little attention to the row of mummies in the hall. They certainly
  seemed extraordinarily safe, and one can hardly blame him. But the fact
  remains that, at some period during the morning, the Italian, who, if you
  remember, was padlocked in a bedroom upstairs, escaped. How I can't tell you:
  he must have had a key in his pocket. They found the padlock open, and the
  room empty. And going downstairs they found the chairs recently occupied by
  the clergyman and Miss Janet empty also. Moreover from that moment no trace
  of any of them has been found. It is as if the earth had opened and swallowed
  them. Which brings us to the packet enclosed with the letter from the leader
  of the Black Gang."</p>

  <p>He crossed to a safe and took out the little chamois-leather bag of
  diamonds.</p>

  <p>"Nice stones," he remarked quietly. "Worth literally a King's ransom. The
  pink one is part of the Russian crown jewels: the remainder belonged to the
  Grand Duke Georgius, who was murdered by the Bolshevists. His son, who had
  these in his possession, died ten days ago of an overdose of a sleeping-
  draught in Amsterdam. At least that is what I understood until I received
  these. Now I am not so sure. I would go further, and say I am quite sure that
  even if he did die of an overdose, it was administered by the beneficent
  clergyman calling himself the Reverend Theodosius Longmoor&mdash;the most
  amazing international criminal of this or any other age&mdash;the man who,
  with Miss Janet and the Italian, has vanished into thin air, right under
  McIver's nose."</p>

  <p>"And you mean to say this man has been in England and you haven't laid him
  by the heels?" said Sir John incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately that is what I mean," answered the other. "The police of
  four continents know about him, but that's a very different thing from proof.
  This time we had proof&mdash;these diamonds: and the man has
  vanished&mdash;utterly and completely. He is the master mind who controls and
  directs, but very rarely actually does anything himself. That's why he's so
  devilishly difficult to catch. But we'll do it sooner or later."</p>

  <p>The Cabinet Minister was once more studying the typewritten communication
  from the leader of the Black Gang.</p>

  <p>"It's the most astounding affair, this, Johnstone," he said at length.
  "Most astounding. And what's all this about the island off the coast of
  Mull?"</p>

  <p>Sir Bryan laughed.</p>

  <p>"Not the least astounding part of the whole show, I assure you. But for
  you to understand it better I must go back two or three months, to the time
  when we first became aware of the existence of the Black Gang. A series of
  very strange disappearances were taking place: men were being spirited away,
  without leaving a trace behind them. Of course we knew about it, but in view
  of the fact that our assistance was never asked to find them, and still more
  in view of the fact that in every case they were people whose room we
  preferred to their company, we lay low and said nothing.</p>

  <p>"From unofficial inquiries I had carried out we came to the conclusion
  that this mysterious Black Gang was a reality, and that, further, it was
  intimately connected with these disappearances. But we also came to the
  conclusion that the ideals and objects of this gang were in every way
  desirable. Such a thing, of course, could not be admitted officially: the
  abduction of anyone is a criminal offence. But we came to the conclusion that
  the Black Gang was undoubtedly an extremely powerful and ably led
  organisation whose object was simply and solely to fight the Red element in
  England. The means they adopted were undoubtedly illegal&mdash;but the
  results were excellent. Whenever a man appeared preaching Bolshevism, after a
  few days he simply disappeared. In short, a reign of terror was established
  amongst the terrorists. And it was to put that right I have no doubt that the
  Reverend Theodosius Longmoor arrived in this country." Sir Bryan thoughtfully
  lit another cigarette. "To return to the island. McIver went there, and after
  some little difficulty located it, out of the twenty or thirty to which the
  description might apply. He found it far from uninhabited, just as that
  letter says. He found it occupied by some fifty or sixty rabid
  anarchists&mdash;the gentlemen who had so mysteriously disappeared&mdash;who
  were presided over by twenty large demobilised soldiers commanded by an
  ex-sergeant-major of the Guards. The sixty frenzied anarchists, he gathered,
  were running a state on communist lines, as interpreted by the
  ex-sergeant-major. And the interpretation moved even McIver to tears of
  laughter. It appeared that once every three hours they were all drawn up in a
  row, and the sergeant-major, with a voice like a bull, would bellow:</p>

  <p>"'Should the ruling classes have money?'</p>

  <p>"Then they answered in unison&mdash;' No.'</p>

  <p>"'Should anyone have money?'</p>

  <p>"Again they answered 'No.'</p>

  <p>"'Should everyone work for the common good for love?'</p>

  <p>"'Yes.'</p>

  <p>"Whereat he would roar: 'Well, in this 'ere island there ain't no ruling
  classes, and there ain't no money, and there's dam' little love, so go and
  plant more potatoes, you lop-eared sons of Beelzebub.'</p>

  <p>"At which point the parade broke up in disorder."</p>

  <p>Sir John was shaking helplessly.</p>

  <p>"This is a jest, Johnstone. You're joking."</p>

  <p>"I'm not," answered the other. "But I think you'll admit that the man who
  started the whole show&mdash;the leader of the Black Gang&mdash;is a
  humorist, to put it mildly, who cannot well be spared."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, as I said before, the Cabinet is the only place for him.
  If only he'd export two or three of my colleagues to this island and let 'em
  plant potatoes I'd take off my hat to him. Tell me&mdash;do I know him?" Sir
  Bryan smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'm not certain: you may. But the point, Haverton, is this. We must take
  cognisance of the whole thing, if we acknowledge it at all. Therefore shall
  we assume that everything I have been telling you is a fairy story: that the
  Black Gang is non-existent&mdash;I may say that it will be shortly&mdash;and
  that what has already appeared in the papers is just a hoax by some
  irresponsible person? Unless we do that there will be a cause celebre fought
  out on class prejudice&mdash;a most injudicious thing at the present moment.
  I may say that the island is shut down, and the sixty pioneers have departed
  to other countries. Also quite a number of those agents whose names are on
  the list you have have left our shores during the past few days. It is merely
  up to us to see that they don't come back. But nothing has come out in the
  papers: and I don't want anything to come out either."</p>

  <p>He paused suddenly, as a cheerful voice was heard in the office
  outside.</p>

  <p>"Ah! here is one Captain Drummond, whom I asked to come round this
  morning," he continued, with a faint smile. "I wonder if you know him."</p>

  <p>"Drummond?" repeated the other. "Is he a vast fellow with an ugly
  face?"</p>

  <p>"That's the man," said Sir Bryan.</p>

  <p>"I've seen him at his aunt's&mdash;old Lady Meltrose. She says he's the
  biggest fool in London."</p>

  <p>Sir Bryan's smile grew more pronounced as the door opened and Hugh came
  in.</p>

  <p>"Morning, Tum-tum," he boomed genially. "How's the liver and all
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Morning, Hugh. Do you know Sir John Haverton?"</p>

  <p>"Morning, Sir John. Jolly old Cabinet merry and bright? Or did you all go
  down on Purple Polly at Goodwood yesterday?"</p>

  <p>Sir John rose a little grimly. "We have other things to do besides backing
  horses, Captain Drummond. I think we have met at Lady Meltrose's house,
  haven't we?"</p>

  <p>"More than likely," said Hugh affably. "I don't often dine there: she
  ropes in such a ghastly crowd of bores, don't you know."</p>

  <p>"I feel sure, Captain Drummond, that you're an admirable judge." Sir John
  turned to Sir Bryan Johnstone and held out his hand. "Well, I must be off.
  Good morning, Johnstone&mdash;and you've thoroughly roused my curiosity. I'd
  very much like to know who the gentleman is whom we've been discussing. And
  in the meantime I'll look through these papers and let you know my decision
  in due course."</p>

  <p>He bustled out of the office, and Hugh sank into a chair with a sigh of
  relief.</p>

  <p>"The old boy's clothes seem full of body this morning. Tum-tum," he
  remarked as the door closed. "Indigestion&mdash;or don't the elastic-sided
  boots fit?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know what we have been discussing, Hugh?" said the other
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"Not an earthly, old man. Was it that new one about the girl in the
  grocer's shop?"</p>

  <p>"We've been discussing the leader of the Black Gang," said Sir Bryan, with
  his eyes fixed on the man sprawling in the chair opposite.</p>

  <p>Not by the twitch of a muscle did Drummond's face change: he seemed
  engrossed in the task of selecting a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"You've been in Deauville, haven't you, Hugh&mdash;the last few days?"</p>

  <p>"Quite right old man. All among the fairies."</p>

  <p>"You don't know that a burglary has taken place at your house in
  London?"</p>

  <p>"A burglary!" Drummond sat up with a jerk. "Why the deuce hasn't Denny
  told me?"</p>

  <p>"A very small one," said Sir Bryan, "committed by myself, and perhaps he
  doesn't know. I took&mdash;your typewriter."</p>

  <p>For a few moments Hugh Drummond stared at him in silence: then his lips
  began to twitch. "I see," he said at length. "I meant to have that defective
  's' repaired."</p>

  <p>"You took me in, old boy," continued Sir Bryan, "utterly and absolutely.
  If it hadn't been for one of the men at Maybrick Hall turning King's
  evidence, I don't believe I should have found out now."</p>

  <p>"Well, what are you going to do about it?" asked Drummond after a
  pause.</p>

  <p>"Nothing. I was discussing the matter with Sir John this morning, and we
  both agreed that you either deserved penal servitude or a seat in the
  Cabinet. And since neither course commends itself to us, we have decided to
  do nothing. There are reasons, which you will appreciate, against any
  publicity at the moment. But, Hugh, the Black Gang must cease."</p>

  <p>Drummond nodded. "Carried, nem. con; Tum-tum. It shall automatically
  dissolve to-day."</p>

  <p>"And further," continued Sir Bryan, "will you relieve my curiosity and
  tell me what sent Charles Latter mad?"</p>

  <p>"I did," said Drummond grimly, "as I told that ass McIver over a cocktail
  at the Regency. He was plotting to blow up three thousand men's employment,
  Tum-tum, with gun-cotton. It was at his instigation that four men were killed
  in Manchester as the result of another outrage. So I lashed him to his bed,
  and underneath him I put what he thought was a slab of gun-cotton with fuse
  attached. It wasn't gun-cotton: it was wood. And he went mad." He paused for
  a moment, and then continued. "Now, one for you. Why did you let Carl
  Peterson escape? I nearly killed him that night, after I'd bayoneted the
  Russian."</p>

  <p>"How did you know he had escaped?" demanded Sir Bryan.</p>

  <p>Hugh felt in his pocket and produced a note.</p>

  <p>"Read it," he said, passing it across the desk.</p>

  <p>"It was a pity you forgot that there might be another key to the padlock,
  Captain Drummond," it ran. "And Giuseppi is an old friend of mine. I quite
  enjoyed our single."</p>

  <p>Sir Bryan returned the note without a word, and Drummond replaced it in
  his pocket.</p>

  <p>"That's twice," he said quietly, and suddenly the Director of Criminal
  Investigation, than whom no shrewder judge of men lived, saw and understood
  the real Drummond below the surface of inanity&mdash;the real Drummond, cool,
  resourceful, and inflexible of will&mdash;the real Drummond who was capable
  of organising and carrying through anything and everything once he had set
  his mind to it.</p>

  <p>"That's twice," he repeated, still in the same quiet tone. "Next
  time&mdash;I win."</p>

  <p>"But no more Black Gang, Hugh," said the other warningly.</p>

  <p>Drummond waved a huge hand. "I have spoken, Tum-tum. A rose by any other
  name, perhaps&mdash;but no more Black Gang." He rose and grinned at his
  friend. "It's deuced good of you, old man, and all that..."</p>

  <p>The eyes of the two men met.</p>

  <p>"If it was found out, I should be looking for another job," remarked Sir
  Bryan dryly. "And perhaps I should not get the two thousand pounds which I
  understand the widow of the late lamented Ginger Martin has received
  anonymously."</p>

  <p>"Shut up," said Drummond awkwardly.</p>

  <p>"Delighted, old man," returned the other. "But the police in that district
  are demanding a rise of pay. She has been drunk and disorderly five times in
  the last week."</p>

  <p>To those strong-minded individuals who habitually read the entrancing
  chit-chat of Mrs. Tattle in <i>The Daily Observer</i>, there appeared the
  following morning a delightful description of the last big fancy-dress ball
  of the season held at the Albert Hall the preceding night. Much of it may be
  passed over as unworthy of perpetuation, but the concluding paragraph had its
  points of interest.</p>

  <p>"Half-way through the evening," she wrote in her breezy way, "just as I
  was consuming an ice in one hand with the Duchess of Sussex, and nibbling the
  last of the asparagus in the other with the Princess of Montevideo,
  tastefully disguised as an umbrella-stand, we were treated to the thrill of
  the evening. It seemed as if suddenly there sprang up all round the room a
  mass of mysterious figures clothed from head to foot in black. The dear
  Princess grew quite hysterical, and began to wonder if it was a 'hold up' as
  she so graphically described it. In fact, for safety, she secreted the glass-
  headed parasol&mdash;the only remaining heirloom of the Royal House&mdash;and
  which formed a prominent part of her costume, behind a neighbouring palm.
  Whispers of the mysterious Black Gang were heard on all sides, but we were
  soon reassured. Belovedst, they all carried champagne bottles! Wasn't it too,
  too thrilling!! And after a while they all formed up in a row, and at a word
  from the leader&mdash;a huge man, my dears, puffectly 'uge&mdash;they
  discharged the corks in a volley at one of the boxes, which sheltered no less
  than two celebrities&mdash;Sir Bryan Johnstone, the chief of all the
  policemen, and Sir John Haverton, the Home Secretary. It is rumoured that one
  of the corks became embedded in Sir John's right eye&mdash;but rumour is a
  lying jade, is not she? Anyway loud sounds of revelry and mirth were heard
  proceeding from the box, and going a little later to powder my nose I
  distinctly saw Sir John being taught the intricacies of the fox-trot by the
  huge man in the passage. Presumably the cork had by then been removed from
  his eye, but one never knows, does one? Anything can happen at an Albert Hall
  ball, especially at the end of the season."</p>
