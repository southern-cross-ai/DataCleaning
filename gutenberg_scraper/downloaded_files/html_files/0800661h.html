<h1>DIARY OF A PROVINCIAL LADY</h1>
<p><i>November 7th.</i>&mdash;Plant the indoor bulbs. Just as I am in the middle of
them, Lady Boxe calls. I say, untruthfully, how nice to see her, and beg her to
sit down while I just finish the bulbs. Lady B. makes determined attempt to sit
down in armchair where I have already placed two bulb-bowls and the bag of
charcoal, is headed off just in time, and takes the sofa.</p>
<p>Do I know, she asks, how very late it is for indoor bulbs? September,
really, or even October, is the time. Do I know that the only really reliable
firm for hyacinths is Somebody of Haarlem? Cannot catch the name of the firm,
which is Dutch, but reply Yes, I do know, but think it my duty to buy Empire
products. Feel at the time, and still think, that this is an excellent reply.
Unfortunately Vicky comes into the drawing-room later and says: "O Mummie, are
those the bulbs we got at Woolworths?"</p>
<p>Lady B. stays to tea. (<i>Mem</i>.: Bread-and-butter too thick. Speak to
Ethel.) We talk some more about bulbs, the Dutch School of Painting, our
Vicar's wife, sciatica, and <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i>.</p>
<p>(Query: Is it possible to cultivate the art of conversation when living in
the country all the year round?)</p>
<p>Lady B. enquires after the children. Tell her that Robin&mdash;whom I refer to in
a detached way as "the boy" so that she shan't think I am foolish about him&mdash;is
getting on fairly well at school, and that Mademoiselle says Vicky is starting
a cold.</p>
<p>Do I realise, says Lady B., that the Cold Habit is entirely unnecessary, and
can be avoided by giving the child a nasal douche of salt-and-water every
morning before breakfast? Think of several rather tart and witty rejoinders to
this, but unfortunately not until Lady B.'s Bentley has taken her away.</p>
<p>Finish the bulbs and put them in the cellar. Feel that after all cellar is
probably draughty, change my mind, and take them all up to the attic.</p>
<p>Cook says something is wrong with the range.</p>
<p><i>November 8th.</i>&mdash;Robert has looked at the range and says nothing wrong
whatever. Makes unoriginal suggestion about pulling out dampers. Cook very
angry, and will probably give notice. Try to propitiate her by saying that we
are going to Bournemouth for Robin's half-term, and that will give the
household a rest. Cook replies austerely that they will take the opportunity to
do some extra cleaning. Wish I could believe this was true.</p>
<p>Preparations for Bournemouth rather marred by discovering that Robert, in
bringing down the suit-cases from the attic, has broken three of the
bulb-bowls. Says he understood that I had put them in the cellar, and so wasn't
expecting them.</p>
<p><i>November 11th.&mdash;Bournemouth.</i> Find that history, as usual, repeats
itself. Same hotel, same frenzied scurry round the school to find Robin, same
collection of parents, most of them also staying at the hotel. Discover strong
tendency to exchange with fellow-parents exactly the same remarks as last year,
and the year before that. Speak of this to Robert, who returns no answer.
Perhaps he is afraid of repeating himself? This suggests Query: Does Robert,
perhaps, take in what I say even when he makes no reply?</p>
<p>Find Robin looking thin, and speak to Matron who says brightly, Oh no, she
thinks on the whole he's put <i>on</i> weight this term, and then begins to
talk about the New Buildings. (Query: Why do all schools have to run up New
Buildings about once in every six months?)</p>
<p>Take Robin out. He eats several meals, and a good many sweets. He produces a
friend, and we take both to Corfe Castle. The boys climb, Robert smokes in
silence, and I sit about on stones. Overhear a woman remark, as she gazes up at
half a tower, that has withstood several centuries, that This looks
<i>fragile</i>&mdash;which strikes me as a singular choice of adjective. Same woman,
climbing over a block of solid masonry, points out that This has evidently
fallen off somewhere.</p>
<p>Take the boys back to the hotel for dinner. Robin says, whilst the friend is
out of hearing: "It's been nice for us, taking out Williams, hasn't it?"
Hastily express appreciation of this privilege.</p>
<p>Robert takes the boys back after dinner, and I sit in hotel lounge with
several other mothers and we all talk about our boys in tones of disparagement,
and about one another's boys with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Am asked what I think of <i>Harriet Hume</i> but am unable to say, as I have
not read it. Have a depressed feeling that this is going to be another case of
<i>Orlando</i> about which was perfectly able to talk most intelligently until
I read it, and found myself unfortunately unable to understand any of it.</p>
<p>Robert comes up very late and says he must have dropped asleep over the
<i>Times</i>. (Query: Why come to Bournemouth to do this?)</p>
<p>Postcard by the last post from Lady B. to ask if I have remembered that
there is a Committee Meeting of the Women's Institute on the 14th. Should not
dream of answering this.</p>
<p><i>November 12th.</i>&mdash;Home yesterday and am struck, as so often before, by
immense accumulation of domestic disasters that always await one after any
absence. Trouble with kitchen range has resulted in no hot water, also Cook
says the mutton has <i>gone</i>, and will I speak to the butcher, there being
no excuse weather like this. Vicky's cold, unlike the mutton, hasn't gone.
Mademoiselle says, "Ah, cette petite! Elle ne sera peut-&ecirc;tre pas
longtemps pour ce bas monde, madame." Hope that this is only her Latin way of
dramatising the situation.</p>
<p>Robert reads the <i>Times</i> after dinner, and goes to sleep.</p>
<p><i>November 13th.</i>&mdash;Interesting, but disconcerting, train of thought
started by prolonged discussion with Vicky as to the existence or otherwise of
a locality which she refers to throughout as H.E.L. Am determined to be a
modern parent, and assure her that there is not, never has been, and never
could be, such a place. Vicky maintains that there <i>is</i>, and refers me to
the Bible. I become more modern than ever, and tell her that theories of
eternal punishment were invented to frighten people. Vicky replies indignantly
that they don't frighten her in the least, she <i>likes</i> to think about
H.E.L. Feel that deadlock has been reached, and can only leave her to her
singular method of enjoying herself.</p>
<p>(Query: Are modern children going to revolt against being modern, and if so,
what form will reaction of modern parents take?)</p>
<p>Much worried by letter from the Bank to say that my account is overdrawn to
the extent of Eight Pounds, four shillings, and fourpence. Cannot understand
this, as was convinced that I still had credit balance of Two Pounds, seven
shillings, and sixpence. Annoyed to find that my accounts, contents of
cash-box, and counterfoils in cheque-book, do not tally. (<i>Mem</i>.: Find
envelope on which I jotted down Bournemouth expenses, also little piece of
paper (probably last leaf of grocer's book) with note about cash payment to
sweep. This may clear things up.)</p>
<p>Take a look at bulb-bowls on returning suit-case to attic, and am inclined
to think it looks as though the cat had been up here. If so, this will be the
last straw. Shall tell Lady Boxe that I sent all my bulbs to a sick friend in a
nursing-home.</p>
<p><i>November 14th.</i>&mdash;Arrival of Book of the Month choice, and am
disappointed. History of a place I am not interested in, by an author I do not
like. Put it back into its wrapper again and make fresh choice from Recommended
List. Find, on reading small literary bulletin enclosed with book, that exactly
this course of procedure has been anticipated, and that it is described as
being "the mistake of a lifetime". Am much annoyed, although not so much at
having made (possibly) mistake of a lifetime, as at depressing thought of our
all being so much alike that intelligent writers can apparently predict our
behaviour with perfect accuracy.</p>
<p>Decide not to mention any of this to Lady B., always so tiresomely superior
about Book of the Month as it is, taking up attitude that she does not require
to be told what to read. (Should like to think of good repartee to this.)</p>
<p>Letter by second post from my dear old school-friend Cissie Crabbe, asking
if she may come here for two nights or so on her way to Norwich. (Query: Why
Norwich? Am surprised to realise that anybody ever goes to, lives at, or comes
from, Norwich, but quite see that this is unreasonable of me. Remind myself how
very little one knows of the England one lives in, which vaguely suggests a
quotation. This, however, does not materialise.)</p>
<p>Many years since we last met, writes Cissie, and she expects we have both
<i>changed</i> a good deal. P.S. Do I remember the dear old pond, and the day
of the Spanish Arrowroot. Can recall, after some thought, dear old <i>pond</i>,
at bottom of Cissie's father's garden, but am completely baffled by Spanish
Arrowroot. (Query: Could this be one of the Sherlock Holmes stories? Sounds
like it.)</p>
<p>Reply that we shall be delighted to see her, and what a lot we shall have to
talk about, after all these years! (This, I find on reflection, is not true,
but cannot re-write letter on that account.) Ignore Spanish Arrowroot
altogether.</p>
<p>Robert, when I tell him about dear old school-friend's impending arrival,
does not seem pleased. Asks what we are expected to <i>do</i> with her. I
suggest showing her the garden, and remember too late that this is hardly the
right time of the year. At any rate, I say, it will be nice to talk over old
times&mdash;(which reminds me of the Spanish Arrowroot reference still
unfathomed).</p>
<p>Speak to Ethel about the spare room, and am much annoyed to find that one
blue candlestick has been broken, and the bedside rug has gone to the cleaners,
and cannot be retrieved in time. Take away bedside rug from Robert's
dressing-room, and put it in spare room instead, hoping he will not notice its
absence.</p>
<p><i>November 15th.</i>&mdash;Robert does notice absence of rug, and says he must
have it back again. Return it to dressing-room and take small and inferior dyed
mat from the night-nursery to put in spare room. Mademoiselle is hurt about
this and says to Vicky, who repeats it to me, that in this country she finds
herself treated like a worm.</p>
<p><i>November 17th.</i>&mdash;Dear old school-friend Cissie Crabbe due by the three
o'clock train. On telling Robert this, he says it is most inconvenient to meet
her, owing to Vestry Meeting, but eventually agrees to abandon Vestry Meeting.
Am touched. Unfortunately, just after he has started, telegram arrives to say
that dear old school-friend has missed the connection and will not arrive until
seven o'clock. This means putting off dinner till eight, which Cook won't like.
Cannot send message to kitchen by Ethel, as it is her afternoon out, so am
obliged to tell Cook myself. She is not pleased. Robert returns from station,
not pleased either. Mademoiselle, quite inexplicably, says, "Il ne manquait que
ca!" (This comment wholly unjustifiable, as non-appearance of Cissie Crabbe
cannot concern her in any way. Have often thought that the French are
tactless.)</p>
<p>Ethel returns, ten minutes late, and says Shall she light fire in spare
room? I say No, it is not cold enough&mdash;but really mean that Cissie is no
longer, in my opinion, deserving of luxuries. Subsequently feel this to be
unworthy attitude, and light fire myself. It smokes.</p>
<p>Robert calls up to know What is that Smoke? I call down that It is Nothing.
Robert comes up and opens the window and shuts the door and says It will Go all
right Now. Do not like to point out that the open window will make the room
cold.</p>
<p>Play Ludo with Vicky in drawing-room.</p>
<p>Robert reads the <i>Times</i> and goes to sleep, but wakes in time to make
second expedition to the station. Thankful to say that this time he returns
with Cissie Crabbe, who has put on weight, and says several times that she
supposes we have both <i>changed</i> a good deal, which I consider
unnecessary.</p>
<center>
<p><a name="0800661h-01" id="0800661h-01"></a><img alt="" src=
"0800661h-images/0800661h-01.jpg"></p>
</center>
<p>Take her upstairs&mdash;spare room like an icehouse, owing to open window, and
fire still smoking, though less&mdash;She says room is delightful, and I leave her,
begging her to ask for anything she wants&mdash;(<i>Mem</i>.: tell Ethel she
<i>must</i> answer spare room bell if it rings&mdash;Hope it won't.)</p>
<p>Ask Robert while dressing for dinner what he thinks of Cissie. He says he
has not known her long enough to judge. Ask if he thinks her good-looking. He
says he has not thought about it. Ask what they talked about on the way from
the station. He says he does not remember.</p>
<p><i>November 19th.</i>&mdash;Last two days very, very trying, owing to quite
unexpected discovery that Cissie Crabbe is strictly on a diet. This causes
Robert to take a dislike to her. Utter impossibility of obtaining lentils or
lemons at short notice makes housekeeping unduly difficult. Mademoiselle in the
middle of lunch insists on discussing diet question, and several times
exclaims: "Ah, mon doux St. Joseph!" which I consider profane, and beg her
never to repeat.</p>
<p>Consult Cissie about the bulbs, which look very much as if the mice had been
at them. She says: Unlimited Watering, and tells me about her own bulbs at
Norwich. Am discouraged.</p>
<p>Administer Unlimited Water to the bulbs (some of which goes through the
attic floor on to the landing below), and move half of them down to the cellar,
as Cissie Crabbe says attic is airless.</p>
<p>Our Vicar's wife calls this afternoon. Says she once knew someone who had
relations living near Norwich, but cannot remember their name. Cissie Crabbe
replies that very likely if we knew their name we might find she'd heard of
them, or even <i>met</i> them. We agree that the world is a small place. Talk
about the Riviera, the new waist-line, choir-practice, the servant question,
and Ramsay MacDonald.</p>
<p><i>November 22nd.</i>&mdash;Cissie Crabbe leaves. Begs me in the kindest way to
stay with her in Norwich (where she has already told me that she lives in a
bed-sitting-room with two cats, and cooks her own lentils on a gas-ring). I say
Yes, I should love to. We part effusively.</p>
<p>Spend entire morning writing the letters I have had to leave unanswered
during Cissie's visit.</p>
<p>Invitation from Lady Boxe to us to dine and meet distinguished literary
friends staying with her, one of whom is the author of <i>Symphony in Three
Sexes</i>. Hesitate to write back and say that I have never heard of
<i>Symphony in Three Sexes</i>, so merely accept. Ask for <i>Symphony in Three
Sexes</i> at the library, although doubtfully. Doubt more than justified by
tone in which Mr. Jones replies that it is not in stock, and never has
been.</p>
<p>Ask Robert whether he thinks I had better wear my Blue or my Black-and-gold
at Lady B.'s. He says that either will do. Ask if he can remember which one I
wore last time. He cannot. Mademoiselle says it was the Blue, and offers to
make slight alterations to Black-and-gold which will, she says, render it
unrecognisable. I accept, and she cuts large pieces out of the back of it. I
say: "Pas trop d&eacute;collet&eacute;e," and she replies intelligently: "Je
comprends, Madame ne desire pas se voir nue au salon."</p>
<p>(Query: Have not the French sometimes a very strange way of expressing
themselves, and will this react unfavourably on Vicky?)</p>
<p>Tell Robert about the distinguished literary friends, but do not mention
<i>Symphony in Three Sexes</i>. He makes no answer.</p>
<p>Have absolutely decided that if Lady B. should introduce us to distinguished
literary friends, or anyone else, as Our Agent, and Our Agent's Wife, I shall
at once leave the house.</p>
<p>Tell Robert this. He says nothing. (<i>Mem</i>.: Put evening shoes out of
window to see if fresh air will remove smell of petrol.)</p>
<p><i>November 25th.</i>&mdash;Go and get hair cut and have manicure in the morning,
in honour of Lady B.'s dinner party. Should like new pair of evening stockings,
but depressing communication from Bank, still maintaining that I am overdrawn,
prevents this, also rather unpleasantly worded letter from Messrs. Frippy and
Coleman requesting payment of overdue account by return of post. Think better
not to mention this to Robert, as bill for coke arrived yesterday, also
reminder that Rates are much overdue, therefore write civilly to Messrs. F. and
C. to the effect that cheque follows in a few days. (Hope they may think I have
temporarily mislaid cheque-book.)</p>
<p>Black-and-gold as rearranged by Mademoiselle very satisfactory, but am
obliged to do my hair five times owing to wave having been badly set. Robert
unfortunately comes in just as I am using bran-new and expensive lip-stick, and
objects strongly to result.</p>
<p>(Query: If Robert could be induced to go to London rather oftener, would he
perhaps take broader view of these things?)</p>
<p>Am convinced we are going to be late, as Robert has trouble in getting car
to start, but he refuses to be agitated. Am bound to add that subsequent events
justify this attitude, as we arrive before anybody else, also before Lady B. is
down. Count at least a dozen Roman hyacinths growing in bowls all over the
drawing-room. (Probably grown by one of the gardeners, whatever Lady B. may
say. Resolve not to comment on them in any way, but am conscious that this is
slightly ungenerous.)</p>
<p>Lady B. comes down wearing silver lace frock that nearly touches the floor
all round, and has new waist-line. This may or not be becoming, but has effect
of making everybody else's frock look out-of-date.</p>
<p>Nine other people present besides ourselves, most of them staying in house.
Nobody is introduced. Decide that a lady in what looks like blue tapestry is
probably responsible for <i>Symphony in Three Sexes</i>.</p>
<p>Just as dinner is announced Lady B. murmurs to me: "I've put you next to Sir
William. He's interested in <i>water-supplies</i>, you know, and I thought
you'd like to talk to him about local conditions."</p>
<p>Find, to my surprise, that Sir W. and I embark almost at once on the subject
of Birth Control. Why or how this topic presents itself cannot say at all, but
greatly prefer it to water-supplies. On the other side of the table, Robert is
sitting next to <i>Symphony in Three Sexes</i>. Hope he is enjoying
himself.</p>
<p>Conversation becomes general. Everybody (except Robert) talks about books.
We all say (a) that we have read <i>The Good Companions</i>, (b) that it is a
very <i>long</i> book, (c) that it was chosen by the Book of the Month Club in
America and must be having immense sales, and (d) that American sales are What
Really Count. We then turn to <i>High Wind in Jamaica</i> and say (a) that it
is quite a short book, (b) that we hated&mdash;or, alternatively, adored&mdash;it, and
(c) that it Really <i>Is</i> exactly <i>Like</i> Children. A small minority
here surges into being, and maintains No, they Cannot Believe that any children
in the World wouldn't ever have <i>noticed</i> that John wasn't there any more.
They can swallow everything else, they say, but not <i>that</i>. Discussion
very active indeed. I talk to pale young man with horn-rimmed glasses, sitting
at my left-hand, about Jamaica, where neither of us has ever been. This
leads&mdash;but cannot say how&mdash;to stag-hunting, and eventually to homeopathy.
(<i>Mem</i>.: Interesting, if time permitted, to trace train of thought leading
on from one topic to another. Second, and most disquieting idea: perhaps no
such train of thought exists.) Just as we reach interchange of opinions about
growing cucumbers under glass, Lady B. gets up.</p>
<p>Go into the drawing-room, and all exclaim how nice it is to see the fire.
Room very cold. (Query: Is this good for the bulbs?) Lady in blue tapestry
takes down her hair, which she says she is growing, and puts it up again. We
all begin to talk about hair. Depressed to find that everybody in the world,
except apparently myself, has grown, or is growing, long hair again. Lady B.
says that Nowadays, there Isn't a Shingled Head to be seen <i>anywhere</i>,
either in London, Paris, or New York. Nonsense.</p>
<p>Discover, in the course of the evening, that the blue tapestry has nothing
whatever to do with literature, but is a Government Sanitary Inspector, and
that <i>Symphony in Three Sexes</i> was written by pale young man with glasses.
Lady B. says, Did I get him on to the subject of <i>perversion</i>, as he is
always so amusing about it? I reply evasively.</p>
<p>Men come in, and all herded into billiard room (just as drawing-room seems
to be getting slightly warmer) where Lady B. inaugurates unpleasant game of
skill with billiard balls, involving possession of a Straight Eye, which most
of us do not possess. Robert does well at this. Am thrilled, and feel it to be
more satisfactory way of acquiring distinction than even authorship of
<i>Symphony in Three Sexes</i>.</p>
<p>Congratulate Robert on the way home, but he makes no reply.</p>
<p><i>November 26th.</i>&mdash;Robert says at breakfast that he thinks we are no
longer young enough for late nights.</p>
<p>Frippy and Coleman regret that they can no longer allow account to stand
over, but must request favour of a cheque by return, or will be compelled, with
utmost regret, to take Further Steps. Have written to Bank to transfer Six
Pounds, thirteen shillings, and tenpence from Deposit Account to Current. (This
leaves Three Pounds, seven shillings, and twopence, to keep Deposit Account
open.) Decide to put off paying milk book till next month, and to let cleaners
have something on account instead of full settlement. This enables me to send
F. and C. cheque, post-dated Dec. 1st, when allowance becomes due. Financial
instability very trying.</p>
<p><i>November 28th.</i>&mdash;Receipt from F. and C. assuring me of attention to my
future wishes&mdash;but evidently far from realising magnitude of effort involved in
setting myself straight with them.</p>
<p><i>December 1st.</i>&mdash;Cable from dear Rose saying she lands at Tilbury on
10th. Cable back welcome, and will meet her Tilbury, 10th. Tell Vicky that her
godmother, my dearest friend, is returning home after three years in America.
Vicky says: "Oh, will she have a present for me?" Am disgusted with her
mercenary attitude and complain to Mademoiselle, who replies: "Si la Sainte
Vierge revenait sur la terre, madame, ce serait notre petite Vicky." Do not at
all agree with this. Moreover, in other moods Mademoiselle first person to
refer to Vicky as "ce petit demon enrage".</p>
<p>(Query: Are the Latin races always as sincere as one would wish them to
be?)</p>
<p><i>December 3rd.</i>&mdash;Radio from dear Rose, landing Plymouth 8th after all.
Send return message, renewed welcomes, and will meet her Plymouth.</p>
<p>Robert adopts unsympathetic attitude and says This is Waste of Time and
Money. Do not know if he means cables, or journey to meet ship, but feel sure
better not to enquire. Shall go to Plymouth on 7th. (<i>Mem</i>.: Pay grocer's
book before I go, and tell him last lot of gingernuts were soft. Find out first
if Ethel kept tin properly shut.)</p>
<p><i>December 8th.&mdash;Plymouth.</i> Arrived last night, terrific storm, ship
delayed. Much distressed at thought of Rose, probably suffering severe
sea-sickness. Wind howls round hotel, which shakes, rain lashes against
window-pane all night. Do not like my room and have unpleasant idea that
someone may have committed a murder in it. Mysterious door in corner which I
feel conceals a corpse. Remember all the stories I have read to this effect,
and cannot sleep. Finally open mysterious door and find large cupboard, but no
corpse. Go back to bed again.</p>
<p>Storm worse than ever in the morning, am still more distressed at thought of
Rose, who will probably have to be carried off ship in state of collapse.</p>
<p>Go round to Shipping Office and am told to be on docks at ten o'clock.
Having had previous experience of this, take fur coat, camp-stool, and copy of
<i>American Tragedy</i> as being longest book I can find, and camp myself on
docks. Rain stops. Other people turn up and look enviously at camp-stool. Very
old lady in black totters up and down till I feel guilty, and offer to give up
camp-stool to her. She replies: "Thank you, thank you, but my Daimler is
outside, and I can sit in that when I wish to do so."</p>
<p>Return to <i>American Tragedy</i> feeling discouraged.</p>
<p>Find <i>American Tragedy</i> a little oppressive, but read on and on for
about two hours when policeman informs me that tender is about to start for
ship, if I wish to go on board. Remove self, camp-stool, and <i>American
Tragedy</i> to tender. Read for forty minutes. (Mem.: Ask Rose if American life
is really like that.)</p>
<p>Very, very unpleasant half-hour follows. Camp-stool shows tendency to slide
about all over the place, and am obliged to abandon <i>American Tragedy</i> for
the time being.</p>
<p>Numbers of men of seafaring aspect walk about and look at me. One of them
asks Am I a good sailor? No, I am not. Presently ship appears, apparently
suddenly rising up from the middle of the waves, and ropes are dangled in every
direction. Just as I catch sight of Rose, tender is carried away from ship's
side by colossal waves.</p>
<p>Consoled by reflection that Rose is evidently not going to require carrying
on shore, but presently begin to feel that boot, as they say, may be on the
other leg.</p>
<p>More waves, more ropes, and tremendous general activity.</p>
<p>I return to camp-stool, but have no strength left to cope with <i>American
Tragedy</i>. A man in oilskins tells me I am In the Way there, Miss.</p>
<p>Remove myself, camp-stool, and <i>American Tragedy</i> to another corner. A
man in sea-boots says that If I stay there, I may get Badly Knocked About.</p>
<p>Renewed d&eacute;m&eacute;nagement of self, camp-stool, <i>American
Tragedy</i>. Am slightly comforted by having been called "Miss".</p>
<p>Catch glimpse of Rose from strange angles as tender heaves up and down.
Gangway eventually materialises, and self, camp-stool, and <i>American
Tragedy</i> achieve the ship. Realise too late that camp-stool and <i>American
Tragedy</i> might equally well have remained where they were.</p>
<p>Dear Rose most appreciative of effort involved by coming to meet her, but
declares herself perfectly good sailor, and slept all through last night's
storm. Try hard not to feel unjustly injured about this.</p>
<p><i>December 9th.</i>&mdash;Rose staying here two days before going on to London.
Says All American houses are Always Warm, which annoys Robert. He says in
return that All American houses are Grossly Overheated and Entirely Airless.
Impossible not to feel that this would carry more weight if Robert had ever
been to America. Rose also very insistent about efficiency of American
Telephone Service, and inclined to ask for glasses of cold water at breakfast
time&mdash;which Robert does not approve of.</p>
<p>Otherwise dear Rose entirely unchanged and offers to put me up in her
West-End flat as often as I like to come to London. Accept gratefully.
(<i>N.B.</i> How very different to old school-friend Cissie Crabbe, with
bed-sitting-room and gas-ring in Norwich! But should not like to think myself
in any way a snob.)</p>
<p>On Rose's advice, bring bulb-bowls up from cellar and put them in
drawing-room. Several of them perfectly visible, but somehow do not look
entirely healthy. Rose thinks too much watering. If so, Cissie Crabbe entirely
to blame. (<i>Mem</i>.: Either move bulb-bowls upstairs, or tell Ethel to show
Lady Boxe into morning-room, if she calls. Cannot possibly enter into further
discussion with her concerning bulbs.)</p>

</center>
<p><i>December 10th.</i>&mdash;Robert, this morning, complains of insufficient
breakfast. Cannot feel that porridge, scrambled eggs, toast, marmalade, scones,
brown bread, and coffee give adequate grounds for this, but admit that porridge
is slightly burnt. How impossible ever to encounter burnt porridge without
vivid recollections of Jane Eyre at Lowood School, say I parenthetically! This
literary allusion not a success. Robert suggests ringing for Cook, and have
greatest difficulty in persuading him that this course utterly disastrous.</p>
<p>Eventually go myself to kitchen, in ordinary course of events, and approach
subject of burnt porridge circuitously and with utmost care. Cook replies, as I
expected, with expressions of astonishment and incredulity, coupled with
assurances that kitchen range is again at fault. She also says that new
double-saucepan, fish-kettle, and nursery tea-cups are urgently required. Make
enquiries regarding recently purchased nursery tea-set and am shown one handle
without cup, saucer in three pieces, and cup from which large semicircle has
apparently been bitten. Feel that Mademoiselle will be hurt if I pursue
enquiries further. (Note: Extreme sensibility of the French sometimes makes
them difficult to deal with.)</p>
<p>Read Life and Letters of distinguished woman recently dead, and am struck,
as so often, by difference between her correspondence and that of less
distinguished women. Immense and affectionate letters from celebrities on every
other page, epigrammatic notes from literary and political acquaintances,
poetical assurances of affection and admiration from husband, and even infant
children. Try to imagine Robert writing in similar strain in the (improbable)
event of my attaining celebrity, but fail. Dear Vicky equally unlikely to
commit her feelings (if any) to paper.</p>
<p>Robin's letter arrives by second post, and am delighted to have it as ever,
but cannot feel that laconic information about boy&mdash;unknown to me&mdash;called
Baggs, having been swished, and Mr. Gompshaw, visiting master, being kept away
by Sore Throat&mdash;is on anything like equal footing with lengthy and picturesque
epistles received almost daily by subject of biography, whenever absent from
home.</p>
<p>Remainder of mail consists of one bill from chemist&mdash;(<i>Mem</i>.: Ask
Mademoiselle why <i>two</i> tubes of Gibbs' Toothpaste within ten
days)&mdash;illiterate postcard from piano-tuner, announcing visit to-morrow, and
circular concerning True Temperance.</p>
<p>Inequalities of Fate very curious. Should like, on this account, to believe
in Reincarnation. Spend some time picturing to myself completely renovated
state of affairs, with, amongst other improvements, total reversal of relative
positions of Lady B. and myself.</p>
<p>(Query: Is thought on abstract questions ever a waste of time?)</p>
<p><i>December 11th.</i>&mdash;Robert, still harping on topic of yesterday's
breakfast, says suddenly Why Not a Ham? to which I reply austerely that a ham
is on order, but will not appear until arrival of R.'s brother William and his
wife, for Christmas visit. Robert, with every manifestation of horror, says Are
William and Angela coming to us for <i>Christmas?</i> This attitude absurd, as
invitation was given months ago, at Robert's own suggestion.</p>
<p>(Query here becomes unavoidable: Does not a misplaced optimism exist, common
to all mankind, leading on to false conviction that social engagements, if
dated sufficiently far ahead, will never really materialise?)</p>
<p>Vicky and Mademoiselle return from walk with small white-and-yellow kitten,
alleged by them homeless and starving. Vicky fetches milk, and becomes excited.
Agree that kitten shall stay "for to-night" but feel that this is weak.</p>
<p>(<i>Mem</i>.: Remind Vicky to-morrow that Daddy does not like cats.)
Mademoiselle becomes very French, on subject of cats generally, and am obliged
to check her. She is <i>bless&eacute;e</i>, and all three retire to
schoolroom.</p>
<center>
<p><a name="0800661h-03" id="0800661h-03"></a><img alt="" src=
"0800661h-images/0800661h-03.jpg"></p>
</center>
<p><i>December 12th.</i>&mdash;Robert says out of the question to keep stray kitten.
Existing kitchen cat more than enough. Gradually modifies this attitude under
Vicky's pleadings. All now depends on whether kitten is male or female. Vicky
and Mademoiselle declare this is known to them, and kitten already christened
Napoleon. Find myself unable to enter into discussion on the point in French.
The gardener takes opposite view to Vicky's and Mademoiselle's. They thereupon
re-christen the kitten, seen playing with an old tennis ball, as Helen
Wills.</p>
<p>Robert's attention, perhaps fortunately, diverted by mysterious trouble with
the water-supply. He says The Ram has Stopped. (This sounds to me
Biblical.)</p>
<p>Give Mademoiselle a hint that H. Wills should not be encouraged to put in
injudicious appearances downstairs.</p>
<p><i>December 13th.</i>&mdash;Ram resumes activities. Helen Wills still with
us.</p>
<p><i>December 16th.</i>&mdash;Very stormy weather, floods out and many trees
prostrated at inconvenient angles. Call from Lady Boxe, who says that she is
off to the South of France next week, as she Must have Sunshine. She asks Why I
do not go there too, and likens me to piece of chewed string, which I feel to
be entirely inappropriate and rather offensive figure of speech, though perhaps
kindly meant.</p>
<p>Why not just pop into the train, enquires Lady B., pop across France, and
pop out into Blue Sky, Blue Sea, and Summer Sun? Could make perfectly
comprehensive reply to this, but do not do so, question of expense having
evidently not crossed Lady B.'s horizon. (<i>Mem</i>.: Interesting subject for
debate at Women's Institute, perhaps: That Imagination is incompatible with
Inherited Wealth. On second thoughts, though, fear this has a socialistic
trend.)</p>
<p>Reply to Lady B. with insincere professions of liking England very much even
in the Winter. She begs me not to let myself become parochially-minded.</p>
<p>Departure of Lady B. with many final appeals to me to reconsider South of
France. Make civil pretence, which deceives neither of us, of wavering, and
promise to ring her up in the event of a change of mind.</p>
<p>(Query: Cannot many of our moral lapses from Truth be frequently charged
upon the tactless persistence of others?)</p>
<p><i>December 17th, London.</i>&mdash;Come up to dear Rose's fiat for two days'
Christmas shopping, after prolonged discussion with Robert, who maintains that
All can equally well be done by Post.</p>
<p>Take early train so as to get in extra afternoon. Have with me Robert's old
leather suit-case, own ditto in fibre, large quantity of chrysanthemums done up
in brown paper for Rose, small packet of sandwiches, handbag, fur coat in case
weather turns cold, book for journey, and illustrated paper kindly presented by
Mademoiselle at the station. (Query: suggests itself: Could not some of these
things have been dispensed with, and if so which?)</p>
<p>Bestow belongings in the rack, and open illustrated paper with sensation of
leisured opulence, derived from unwonted absence of all domestic duties.</p>
<p>Unknown lady enters carriage at first stop, and takes seat opposite. She has
expensive-looking luggage in moderate quantity, and small red morocco
jewel-case, also bran-new copy, without library label, of <i>Life of Sir Edward
Marshall-Hall</i>. Am reminded of Lady B. and have recrudescence of Inferiority
Complex.</p>
<p>Remaining seats occupied by elderly gentleman wearing spats, nondescript
female in a Burberry, and young man strongly resembling an Arthur Watts
drawing. He looks at a copy of <i>Punch</i>, and I spend much time in wondering
if it contains an Arthur Watts drawing and if he is struck by resemblance, and
if so what his reactions are, whether of pain or gratification.</p>
<p>Roused from these unprofitable, but sympathetic, considerations by agitation
on the part of elderly gentleman, who says that, upon his soul, he is being
dripped upon. Everybody looks at ceiling, and Burberry female makes a vague
reference to unspecified "pipes" which she declares often "go like that".
Someone else madly suggests turning off the' heat. Elderly gentleman refuses
all explanations and declares that <i>It comes from the rack</i>. We all look
with horror at Rose's chrysanthemums, from which large drips of water descend
regularly. Am overcome with shame, remove chrysanthemums, apologise to elderly
gentleman, and sit down again opposite to superior unknown, who has remained
glued to <i>Sir E. Marshall-Hall</i> throughout, and reminds me of Lady B. more
than ever.</p>
<p>(<i>Mem</i>.: Speak to Mademoiselle about officiousness of thrusting flowers
into water unasked, just before wrapping up.)</p>
<p>Immerse myself in illustrated weekly. Am informed by it that Lord Toto Finch
(inset) is responsible for camera-study (herewith) of the Loveliest Legs in Los
Angeles, belonging to well-known English Society girl, near relation (by the
way) of famous racing peer, father of well-known Smart Set twins (portrait
overleaf).</p>
<p>(Query: Is our popular Press going to the dogs?)</p>
<p>Turn attention to short story, but give it up on being directed, just as I
become interested, to page XLVIIb, which I am quite unable to locate. Become
involved instead with suggestions for Christmas Gifts. I want my gifts, the
writer assures me, to be individual and yet appropriate&mdash;beautiful, and yet
enduring. Then why not Enamel dressing-table set, at &pound;94 16s. 4d. or Set
of crystal-ware, exact replica of early English cut-glass, at moderate price of
&pound;34 17s. 9d.?</p>
<p>Why not, indeed?</p>
<p>Am touched to discover further on, however, explicit reference to Giver with
Restricted Means&mdash;though even here, am compelled to differ from author's
definition of restricted means. Let originality of thought, she says, add
character to trifling offering. Would not many of my friends welcome suggestion
of a course of treatment&mdash;(six for 5 guineas)&mdash;at Madame Dolly Varden's Beauty
Parlour in Piccadilly to be placed to my account?</p>
<p>Cannot visualise myself making this offer to our Vicar's wife, still less
her reception of it, and decide to confine myself to one-and-sixpenny calendar
with picture of sunset on Scaw Fell, as usual.</p>
<p>(Indulge, on the other hand, in a few moments' idle phantasy, in which I
suggest to Lady B. that she should accept from me as a graceful and appropriate
Christmas gift, a course of Reducing Exercises accompanied by Soothing and
Wrinkle-eradicating Face Massage.)</p>
<p>This imaginative exercise brought to a conclusion by arrival.</p>
<p>Obliged to take taxi from station, mainly owing to chrysanthemums (which
would not combine well with two suit-cases and fur coat on moving stairway,
which I distrust and dislike anyhow, and am only too apt to make conspicuous
failure of Stepping Off with Right Foot foremost)&mdash;but also partly owing to
fashionable locality of Rose's flat, miles removed from any Underground.</p>
<p>Kindest welcome from dear Rose, who is most appreciative of chrysanthemums.
Refrain from mentioning unfortunate incident with elderly gentleman in
train.</p>
<p><i>December 19th.</i>&mdash;Find Christmas shopping very exhausting. Am paralysed
in the Army and Navy Stores on discovering that List of Xmas Presents is lost,
but eventually run it to earth in Children's Books Department. While there
choose book for dear Robin, and wish for the hundredth time that Vicky had been
less definite about wanting Toy Greenhouse and <i>nothing else</i>. This
apparently unprocurable. (<i>Mem</i>.: Take early opportunity of looking up
story of the Roc's Egg to tell Vicky.)</p>
<p>Rose says "Try Selfridge's." I protest, but eventually go there, find
admirable&mdash;though expensive&mdash;Toy Greenhouse, and unpatriotically purchase it at
once. Decide not to tell Robert this.</p>
<p>Choose appropriate offerings for Rose, Mademoiselle, William, and
Angela&mdash;(who will be staying with us, so gifts must be above
calendar-mark)&mdash;and lesser trifles for everyone else. Unable to decide between
almost invisibly small diary, and really handsome card, for Cissie Crabbe, but
eventually settle on diary, as it will fit into ordinary-sized envelope.</p>
<p><i>December 20th.</i>&mdash;Rose takes me to see St. John Ervine's play, and am
much amused. Overhear one lady in stalls ask another: Why don't <i>you</i>
write a play, dear? Well, says the friend, it's so difficult, what with one
thing and another, to find <i>time</i>. Am staggered. (Query: Could I write a
play myself? Could we <i>all</i> write plays, if only we had the time? Reflect
that St. J. E. lives in the same county as myself, but feel that this does not
constitute sound excuse for writing to ask him how he finds the time to write
plays.)</p>
<p><i>December 22nd.</i>&mdash;Return home. One bulb in partial flower, but not
satisfactory.</p>
<p>December 23rd.&mdash;Meet Robin at the Junction. He has lost his ticket, parcel
of sandwiches, and handkerchief, but produces large wooden packing-case, into
which little shelf has been wedged. Understand that this represents result of
Carpentry Class&mdash;expensive "extra" at school&mdash;and is a Christmas present. Will
no doubt appear on bill in due course.</p>
<p>Robin says essential to get gramophone record called "Is Izzy Azzy Wozz?"
(<i>N.B.</i> Am often struck by disquieting thought that the dear children are
entirely devoid of any artistic feeling whatever, in art, literature, or music.
This conviction intensified after hearing "Is Izzy Azzy Wozz?" rendered
fourteen times running on the gramophone, after I have succeeded in obtaining
record.)</p>
<p>Much touched at enthusiastic greeting between Robin and Vicky. Mademoiselle
says, "Ah, c'est gentil!" and produces a handkerchief, which I think
exaggerated, especially as in half-an-hour's time she comes to me with
complaint that R. and V. have gone up into the rafters and are shaking down
plaster from nursery ceiling. Remonstrate with them from below. They sing "Is
Izzy Azzy Wozz?" Am distressed at this, as providing fresh confirmation of
painful conviction that neither has any ear for music, nor ever will have.</p>
<p>Arrival of William and Angela, at half-past three. Should like to hurry up
tea, but feel that servants would be annoyed, so instead offer to show them
their rooms, which they know perfectly well already. We exchange news about
relations. Robin and Vicky appear, still singing "Is Izzy Azzy Wozz?" Angela
says that they have grown. Can see by her expression that she thinks them
odious, and very badly brought-up. She tells me about the children in the last
house she stayed at. All appear to have been miracles of cleanliness,
intelligence, and charm. A. also adds, most unnecessarily, that they are
musical, and play the piano nicely.</p>
<p>(<i>Mem</i>.: A meal the most satisfactory way of entertaining any guest.
Should much like to abridge the interval between tea and dinner&mdash;or else to
introduce supplementary collation in between.)</p>
<p>At dinner we talk again about relations, and ask one another if anything is
ever heard of poor Frederick, nowadays, and how Mollie's marriage is turning
out, and whether Grandmama is thinking of going to the East Coast again this
summer. Am annoyed because Robert and William sit on in the dining-room until
nearly ten o'clock, which makes the servants late.</p>
<center>
<p><a name="0800661h-04" id="0800661h-04"></a><img alt="" src=

</center>
<p><i>December 24th.</i>&mdash;Take entire family to children's party at
neighbouring Rectory. Robin says Damn three times in the Rector's hearing, an
expression never used by him before or since, but apparently reserved for this
unsuitable occasion. Party otherwise highly successful, except that I again
meet recent arrival at the Grange, on whom I have not yet called. She is a Mrs.
Somers, and is said to keep Bees. Find myself next to her at tea, but cannot
think of anything to say about Bees, except Does she <i>like</i> them, which
sounds like a bad riddle, so leave it unsaid and talk about Preparatory Schools
instead. (Am interested to note that no two parents ever seem to have heard of
one another's Preparatory Schools. Query: Can this indicate an undue number of
these establishments throughout the country?)</p>
<p>After dinner, get presents ready for children's stockings. William
unfortunately steps on small glass article of doll's furniture intended for
Vicky, but handsomely offers a shilling in compensation, which I refuse. Much
time taken up in discussing this. At eleven P.M. children still wide awake.
Angela suggests Bridge and asks Who is that Mrs. Somers we met at the Rectory,
who seems to be interested in Bees? (A. evidently more skilled than myself in
social amenities, but do not make this comment aloud.)</p>
<p><i>Xmas Day.</i>&mdash;Festive, but exhausting, Christmas. Robin and Vicky
delighted with everything, and spend much of the day eating. Vicky presents
her Aunt Angela with small square of canvas on which blue donkey is worked in
cross-stitch. Do not know whether to apologise for this or not, but eventually
decide better to say nothing, and hint to Mademoiselle that other design might
have been preferable.</p>
<p>The children perhaps rather too much <i>en &eacute;vidence</i>, as Angela,
towards tea-time, begins to tell me that the little Maitlands have such a
delightful nursery, and always spend entire day in it except when out for long
walks with governess and dogs.</p>
<p>William asks if that Mrs. Somers is one of the <i>Dorsetshire</i> lot&mdash;a
woman who knows about Bees.</p>
<p>Make a note that I really must call on Mrs. S. early next week. Read up
something about Bees before going.</p>
<p>Turkey and plum-pudding cold in the evening, to give servants a rest. Angela
looks at bulbs, and says What made me think they would be in flower for
Christmas? Do not reply to this, but suggest early bed for us all.</p>
<p><i>December 27th.</i>&mdash;Departure of William and Angela. Slight shock
administered at eleventh hour by Angela, who asks if I realise that <i>she</i>
was winner of first prize in last week's <i>Time and Tide</i> Competition,
under the pseudonym of <i>Intelligensia</i>. Had naturally no idea of this, but
congratulate her, without mentioning that I entered for same competition
myself, without success.</p>
<p>(Query: Are Competition Editors always sound on questions of literary merit?
Judgement possibly becomes warped through overwork.)</p>
<p>Another children's party this afternoon, too large and elaborate. Mothers
stand about it in black hats and talk to one another about gardens, books, and
difficulty of getting servants to stay in the country. Tea handed about the
hall in a detached way, while children are herded into another room. Vicky and
Robin behave well, and I compliment them on the way home, but am informed later
by Mademoiselle that she has found large collection of chocolate biscuits in
pocket of Vicky's party-frock.</p>
<p>(<i>Mem</i>.: Would it be advisable to point out to Vicky that this
constitutes failure in intelligence, as well as in manners, hygiene, and common
honesty?)</p>
<p><i>January 1st, 1930.</i>&mdash;We give a children's party ourselves. Very, very
exhausting performance, greatly complicated by stormy weather, which keeps half
the guests away, and causes grave fears as to arrival of the conjurer.</p>
<p>Decide to have children's tea in the dining-room, grown-ups in the study,
and clear the drawing-room for games and conjurer. Minor articles of
drawing-room furniture moved up to my bedroom, where I continually knock myself
against them. Bulb-bowls greatly in everybody's way and are put on
window-ledges in passage, at which Mademoiselle says: "Tiens! &ccedil;a fait un
dr&ocirc;le d'effet, ces malheureux petits brins de verdure!" Do not like this
description at all.</p>
<p>The children from neighbouring Rectory arrive too early, and are shown into
completely empty drawing-room. Entrance of Vicky, in new green party-frock,
with four balloons, saves situation.</p>
<p>(Query: What is the reason that clerical households are always unpunctual,
invariably arriving either first, or last, at any gathering to which
bidden?)</p>
<p>Am struck at variety of behaviour amongst mothers, some so helpful in
organising games and making suggestions, others merely sitting about.
(<i>N.B.</i> For sake of honesty, should rather say <i>standing</i> about, as
supply of chairs fails early.) Resolve always to send Robin and Vicky to
parties without me, if possible, as children without parents infinitely
preferable from point of view of hostess. Find it difficult to get "Oranges and
Lemons" going, whilst at same time appearing to give intelligent attention to
remarks from visiting mother concerning Exhibition of Italian Pictures at
Burlington House. Find myself telling her how marvellous I think them, although
in actual fact have not yet seen them at all. Realise that this mis-statement
should be corrected at once, but omit to do so, and later find myself involved
in entirely unintentional web of falsehood. Should like to work out how far
morally to blame for this state of things, but have not time.</p>
<p>Tea goes off well. Mademoiselle presides in dining-room, I in study. Robert
and solitary elderly father&mdash;(looks more like a grandfather)&mdash;stand in doorway
and talk about big-game shooting and the last General Election, in intervals of
handing tea.</p>
<p>Conjurer arrives late, but is a success with children. Ends up with presents
from a bran-tub, in which more bran is spilt on carpet, children's clothes, and
house generally, than could ever have been got into tub originally. Think this
odd, but have noticed similar phenomenon before.</p>
<p>Guests depart between seven and half-past, and Helen Wills and the dog are
let out by Robin, having been shut up on account of crackers, which they
dislike.</p>
<p>Robert and I spend evening helping servants to restore order, and trying to
remember where ash-trays, clock, ornaments, and ink were put for safety.</p>
<p><i>January 3rd.</i>&mdash;Hounds meet in the village. Robert agrees to take Vicky
on the pony. Robin, Mademoiselle, and I walk to the Post Office to see the
start, and Robin talks about Oliver Twist, making no reference whatever to hunt
from start to finish, and viewing horses, hounds, and huntsmen with equal
detachment. Am impressed at his non-suggestibility, but feel that some deep
Freudian significance may lie behind it all. Feel also that Robert would take
very different view of it.</p>
<p>Meet quantities of hunting neighbours, who say to Robin, "Aren't you riding
too?" which strikes one as lacking in intelligence, and ask me if we have lost
many trees lately, but do not wait for answer, as what they really want to talk
about is the number of trees they have lost themselves.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle looks at hounds and says, "Ah, ces bons chiens!" also admires
horses, "quelles b&ecirc;tes superbes"&mdash;but prudently keeps well away from all,
in which I follow her example.</p>
<p>Vicky looks nice on pony, and I receive compliments about her, which I
accept in an off-hand manner, tinged with incredulity, in order to show that I
am a modern mother and should scorn to be foolish about my children.</p>
<p>Hunt moves off, Mademoiselle remarking, "Voil&agrave; bien le sport
anglais!" Robin says: "Now can we go home?" and eats milk-chocolate. We return
to the house and I write order to the Stores, post-card to the butcher, two
letters about Women's Institutes, one about Girl Guides, note to the dentist
asking for appointment next week, and make memorandum in engagement-book that I
<i>must</i> call on Mrs. Somers at the Grange.</p>
<p>Am horrified and incredulous at discovery that these occupations have filled
the entire morning.</p>
<p>Robert and Vicky return late, Vicky plastered with mud from head to foot but
unharmed. Mademoiselle removes her, and says no more about <i>le sport
anglais</i>.</p>
<p><i>January 4th.</i>&mdash;A beautiful day, very mild, makes me feel that with any
reasonable luck Mrs. Somers will be out, and I therefore call at the Grange.
She is, on the contrary, in. Find her in the drawing-room, wearing printed
velvet frock that I immediately think would look nice on <i>me</i>. No sign
anywhere of Bees, but am getting ready to enquire about them intelligently when
Mrs. Somers suddenly says that her Mother is here, and knows my old
school-friend Cissie Crabbe, who says that I am so <i>amusing</i>. The Mother
comes in&mdash;very elegant Marcel wave&mdash;(cannot imagine where she got it, unless
she has this moment come from London)&mdash;and general air of knowing how to dress
in the country. She is introduced to me&mdash;name sounds exactly like Eggchalk but
do not think this possible&mdash;and says she knows my old school-friend Miss
Crabbe, at Norwich, and has heard all about how very, very amusing I am. Become
completely paralysed and can think of nothing whatever to say except that it
has been very stormy lately. Leave as soon as possible.</p>
<p><i>January 5th.</i>&mdash;Rose, in the kindest way, offers to take me as her
guest to special dinner of famous Literary Club if I will come up to London for
the night. Celebrated editor of literary weekly paper in the chair,
spectacularly successful author of famous play as guest of honour. Principal
authors, poets, and artists from&mdash;says Rose&mdash;all over the world, expected to be
present.</p>
<p>Spend much of the evening talking to Robert about this. Put it to him: (a)
That no expense is involved beyond 3rd class return ticket to London; (b) that
in another twelve years Vicky will be coming out, and it is therefore incumbent
on me to Keep in Touch with People; (c) that this is an opportunity that will
never occur again; (d) that it isn't as if I were asking him to come too.
Robert says nothing to (a) or (b) and only "I should hope not" to (c), but
appears slightly moved by (d). Finally says he supposes I must do as I like,
and very likely I shall meet some old friends of my Bohemian days when living
with Rose in Hampstead.</p>
<p>Am touched by this, and experience passing wonder if Robert can be feeling
slightly jealous. This fugitive idea dispelled by his immediately beginning to
speak about failure of hot water this morning.</p>
<p><i>January 7th.</i>&mdash;Rose takes me to Literary Club dinner. I wear my Blue.
Am much struck by various young men who have defiantly put on flannel shirts
and no ties, and brushed their hair up on end. They are mostly accompanied by
red-headed young women who wear printed cr&ecirc;pe frocks and beads.
Otherwise, everyone in evening dress. Am introduced to distinguished Editor,
who turns out to be female and delightful. Should like to ask her once and for
all why prizes in her paper's weekly competition are so often divided, but feel
this would be unsuitable and put Rose to shame.</p>
<p>Am placed at dinner next to celebrated best-seller, who tells me in the
kindest way how to evade paying super-tax. Am easily able to conceal from him
the fact that I am not at present in a position to require this information.
Very distinguished artist sits opposite, and becomes more and more convivial as
evening advances. This encourages me to remind him that we have met
before&mdash;which we have, in old Hampstead days. He declares enthusiastically that
he remembers me perfectly&mdash;which we both know to be entirely untrue&mdash;and adds
wildly that he has followed my work ever since. Feel it better to let this pass
unchallenged. Later on, distinguished artist is found to have come out without
any money, and all in his immediate neighbourhood are required to lend him
amount demanded by head-waiter.</p>
<p>Feel distinctly thankful that Robert is not with me, and am moreover morally
certain that distinguished artist will remember nothing whatever in the
morning, and will therefore be unable to refund my three-and-sixpence.</p>
<p>Rose handsomely pays for my dinner as well as her own.</p>
<p>(This suggests <i>Mem</i>.: That English cooking, never unduly attractive,
becomes positively nauseating on any public occasion, such as a banquet. Am
seriously distressed at probable reactions of foreign visitors to this
evening's fish, let alone other items.)</p>
<p>Young gentleman is introduced to me by Rose&mdash;(she saying in rapid murmur
that he is part-author of a one-act play that has been acted three times by a
Repertory company in Jugo-Slavia.) It turns out later that he has met Lady
Boxe, who struck him, he adds immediately, as a poisonous woman. We then get on
well together. (Query: Is not a common hate one of the strongest links in human
nature? Answer, most regrettably, in the affirmative.)</p>
<p>Very, very distinguished Novelist approaches me (having evidently mistaken
me for someone else), and talks amiably. She says that she can only write
between twelve at night and four in the morning, and not always then. When she
cannot write, she plays the organ. Should much like to ask whether she is
married&mdash;but get no opportunity of asking that or anything else. She tells me
about her sales. She tells me about her last book. She tells me about her new
one. She says that there are many people here to whom she <i>must</i> speak,
and pursues well-known Poet&mdash;who does not, however, allow her to catch up with
him. Can understand this.</p>

"0800661h-images/0800661h-05.jpg"></p>
</center>
<p>Speeches are made. Am struck, as so often, by the eloquence and profundity
of other people, and reflect how sorry I should be to have to make a speech
myself, although so often kept awake at night composing wholly admirable
addresses to the servants, Lady B., Mademoiselle, and others&mdash;which, however,
never get delivered.</p>
<p>Move about after dinner, and meet acquaintance whose name I have forgotten,
but connect with literature. I ask if he has published anything lately. He says
that his work is not, and never can be, for publication. Thought passes through
my mind to the effect that this attitude might with advantage be adopted by
many others. Do not say so, however, and we talk instead about Rebecca West,
the progress of aviation, and the case for and against stag-hunting.</p>
<p>Rose, who has been discussing psychiatry as practised in the U.S.A. with
Danish journalist, says Am I ready to go? Distinguished artist who sat opposite
me at dinner offers to drive us both home, but his friends intervene. Moreover,
acquaintance whose name I have forgotten takes me aside, and assures me that
D.A. is quite unfit to take anybody home, and will himself require an escort.
Rose and I depart by nearest Tube, as being wiser, if less exalted,
procedure.</p>
<p>Sit up till one o'clock discussing our fellow-creatures, with special
reference to those seen and heard this evening. Rose says I ought to come to
London more often, and suggests that outlook requires broadening.</p>
<p><i>January 9th.</i>&mdash;Came home yesterday. Robin and Mademoiselle no longer
on speaking terms, owing to involved affair centering round a broken
window-pane. Vicky, startlingly, tells me in private that she has learnt a new
Bad Word, but does not mean to use it. Not now, anyway, she disquietingly
adds.</p>
<p>Cook says she hopes I enjoyed my holiday, and it is very quiet in the
country. I leave the kitchen before she has time to say more, but am only too
well aware that this is not the last of it.</p>
<p>Write grateful letter to Rose, at the same time explaining difficulty of
broadening my outlook by further time spent away from home, just at
present.</p>
<p><i>January 14th.</i>&mdash;I have occasion to observe, not for the first time,
how extraordinarily plain a cold can make one look, affecting hair, complexion,
and features generally, besides nose and upper lip. Cook assures me that colds
always run through the house and that she herself has been suffering from sore
throat for weeks, but is never one to make a fuss. (Query: Is this meant to
imply that similar fortitude should be, but is not, displayed by me?)
Mademoiselle says she <i>hopes</i> children will not catch my cold, but that
both sneezed this morning. I run short of handkerchiefs.</p>
<p><i>January 16th.</i>&mdash;We all run short of handkerchiefs.</p>
<p><i>January 17th.</i>&mdash;Mademoiselle suggests butter-muslin. There is none in
the house. I say that I will go out and buy some. Mademoiselle says, "No, the
fresh air gives pneumonia." Feel that I ought to combat this un-British
attitude, but lack energy, especially when she adds that she will go
herself&mdash;"Madame, j'y cours." She puts on black kid gloves, buttoned boots with
pointed tips and high heels, hat with little feather in it, black jacket and
several silk neckties, and goes, leaving me to amuse Robin and Vicky, both in
bed. Twenty minutes after she has started, I remember it is early-closing
day.</p>
<p>Go up to night-nursery and offer to read Lamb's <i>Tales from
Shakespeare</i>. Vicky says she prefers <i>Pip, Squeak, and Wilfred</i>. Robin
says that he would like <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>. Compromise on Grimm's Fairy
Tales, although slightly uneasy as to their being in accordance with best
modern ideals. Both children take immense interest in story of highly
undesirable person who wins fortune, fame, and beautiful Princess by means of
lies, violence, and treachery. Feel sure that this must have disastrous effect
on both in years to come.</p>
<p>Our Vicar's wife calls before Mademoiselle returns. Go down to her,
sneezing, and suggest that she had better not stay. She says, much better not,
and she won't keep me a minute. Tells me long story about the Vicar having a
stye on one eye. I retaliate with Cook's sore throat. This leads to draughts,
the, heating apparatus in church, and news of Lady Boxe in South of France: The
Vicar's wife has had a picture postcard from her (which she produces from bag),
with small cross marking bedroom window of hotel. She says, It's rather
interesting, isn't it? to which I reply Yes, it is, very, which is not in the
least true. (<i>N.B.</i> Truth-telling in everyday life extraordinarily
difficult. Is this personal, and highly deplorable, idiosyncrasy, or do others
suffer in the same way? Have momentary impulse to put this to our Vicar's
wife, but decide better not.)</p>
<p>How, she says, are the dear children, and how is my husband? I reply
suitably, and she tells me about cinnamon, Viapex, gargling with glycerine of
thymnol, blackcurrant tea, onion broth, friar's balsam, linseed poultices, and
thermogene wool. I sneeze and say Thank you&mdash;thank you very much, a good many
times. She goes, but turns back at the door to tell me about wool next the
skin, nasal douching, and hot milk last thing at night. I say Thank you,
again.</p>
<p>On returning to night-nursery, find that Robin has unscrewed top of
hot-water bottle in Vicky's bed, which apparently contained several hundred
gallons of tepid water, now distributed through and through pillows, pyjamas,
sheets, blankets, and mattresses of both. I ring for Ethel&mdash;who helps me to
reorganise entire situation and says It's like a hospital, isn't it, trays up
and down stairs all day long, and all this extra work.</p>
<p><i>January 20th.</i>&mdash;Take Robin, now completely restored, back to school.
I ask the Headmaster what he thinks of his progress. The Headmaster answers
that the New Buildings will be finished before Easter, and that their numbers
are increasing so rapidly that he will probably add on a New Wing next term,
and perhaps I saw a letter of his in the <i>Times</i> replying to Dr. Cyril
Norwood? Make mental note to the effect that Headmasters are a race apart, and
that if parents would remember this, much time could be saved.</p>
<p>Robin and I say good-bye with hideous brightness, and I cry all the way back
to the station.</p>
<p><i>January 22nd.</i>&mdash;Robert startles me at breakfast by asking if my
cold&mdash;which he has hitherto ignored&mdash;is better. I reply that it has gone. Then
why, he asks, do I look like that? Refrain from asking like what, as I know
only too well. Feel that life is wholly unendurable, and decide madly to get a
new hat.</p>
<p>Customary painful situation between Bank and myself necessitates expedient,
also customary, of pawning great-aunt's diamond ring, which I do, under usual
conditions, and am greeted as old friend by Plymouth pawnbroker, who says
facetiously, And what name will it be <i>this</i> time?</p>
<p>Visit four linen-drapers and try on several dozen hats. Look worse and worse
in each one, as hair gets wilder and wilder, and expression paler and more
harassed. Decide to get myself shampooed and waved before doing any more, in
hopes of improving the position.</p>
<p>Hairdresser's assistant says, It's a pity my hair is losing all its colour,
and have I ever thought of having it touched up? After long discussion, I do
have it touched up, and emerge with mahogany-coloured head. Hairdresser's
assistant says this will wear off "in a few days". I am very angry, but all to
no purpose. Return home in old hat, showing as little hair as possible, and
keep it on till dressing time&mdash;but cannot hope to conceal my shame at
dinner.</p>
<p><i>January 23rd.</i>&mdash;Mary Kellway telegraphs she is motoring past here this
morning, can I give her lunch? Telegraph Yes, delighted, and rush to kitchen.
Cook unhelpful and suggests cold beef and beetroot. I say Yes, excellent,
unless perhaps roast chicken and bread sauce even better? Cook talks about the
oven. Compromise in the end on cutlets and mashed potatoes, as, very luckily,
this is the day butcher calls.</p>
<p>Always delighted to see dear Mary&mdash;so clever and amusing, and able to write
stories, which actually get published and paid for&mdash;but very uneasy about
colour of my hair, which is not wearing off in the least. Think seriously of
keeping a hat on all through lunch, but this, on the whole, would look even
more unnatural. Besides, could not hope that it would pass without observation
from Vicky, let alone Robert.</p>
<p><i>Later.</i>&mdash;Worst fears realised, as to hair. Dear Mary, always so
observant, gazes at it in nerve-shattering silence but says nothing, till I am
driven to make half-hearted explanation. Her only comment is that she cannot
imagine why anybody should deliberately make themselves look ten years older
than they need. Feel that, if she wishes to discourage further experiments on
my part, this observation could scarcely be improved upon. Change the subject,
and talk about the children. Mary most sympathetic, and goes so far as to say
that my children have brains, which encourages me to tell anecdotes about them
until I see Robert looking at me, just as I get to Robin's precocious taste for
really good literature. By curious coincidence second post brings letter from
Robin, saying that he wishes to collect cigarette-cards and will I send him all
the types of National Beauty, Curious Beaks, and Famous Footballers, that I can
find. Make no comment on this singular request aloud.</p>
<p>Mary stays to tea and we talk about H. G. Wells, Women's Institutes,
infectious illness, and <i>Journey's End</i>. Mary says she cannot go and see
this latter because she always cries at the theatre. I say, Then once more will
make no difference. Discussion becomes involved, and we drop it. Vicky comes in
and immediately offers to recite. Can see that Mary (who has three children of
her own) does not in the least want to hear her, but she feigns enthusiasm
politely. Vicky recites: "Ma&icirc;tre Corbeau sur un arbre
perch&eacute;"&mdash;(<i>N.B.</i> Suggest to Mademoiselle that Vicky's repertory
should be enlarged. Feel sure that I have heard Maitre Corbeau, alternately
with La Cigale et la Fourmi, some eight hundred times within the last six
months.)</p>
<p>After Mary has gone, Robert looks at me and suddenly remarks: "Now
<i>that's</i> what I call an attractive woman." Am gratified at his
appreciation of talented friend, but should like to be a little clearer
regarding exact significance of emphasis on the word <i>that</i>. Robert,
however, says no more, and opportunity is lost as Ethel comes in to say Cook is
sorry she's run right out of milk, but if I will come to the store-cupboard she
thinks there's a tin of Ideal, and she'll make do with that.</p>
<p><i>January 25th.</i>&mdash;Attend a Committee Meeting in the village to discuss
how to raise funds for Village Hall. Am asked to take the chair. Begin by
saying that I know how much we all have this excellent object at heart, and
that I feel sure there swill be no lack of suggestions as to best method of
obtaining requisite sum of money. Pause for suggestions, which is met with
death-like silence. I say, There are so many ways to choose from&mdash;implication
being that I attribute silence to plethora of ideas, rather than to absence of
them. (<i>Note</i>: Curious and rather depressing, to see how frequently the
pursuit of Good Works leads to apparently unavoidable duplicity.) Silence
continues, and I say Well, twice, and Come, come, once. (Sudden impulse to
exclaim, "I lift up my finger and I say Tweet, Tweet," is fortunately
overcome.) At last: extract a suggestion of a concert from Mrs. L. (whose son
plays the violin) and a whist-drive from Miss P. (who won Ladies' First Prize
at the last one). Florrie P. suggests a dance and is at once reminded that it
will be Lent. She says that Lent isn't what it was. Her mother says the Vicar
is one that holds with Lent, and always has been. Someone else says That
reminds her, has anyone heard that old Mr. Small passed away last night? We all
agree that eighty-six is a great age. Mrs. L. says that on her mother's side of
the family, there is an aunt of ninety-eight. Still with us, she adds. The
aunt's husband, on the other hand, was gathered just before his sixtieth
birthday. Everyone says, You can't ever <i>tell</i>, not really. There is a
suitable pause before we go back to Lent and the Vicar. General opinion that a
concert isn't like a dance, and needn't&mdash;says Mrs. L.&mdash;interfere.</p>
<p>On this understanding, we proceed. Various familiar items&mdash;piano solo,
recitation, duet, and violin solo from Master L.&mdash;are all agreed upon. Someone
says that Mrs. F. and Miss H. might do a dialogue, and has to be reminded that
they are no longer on speaking terms, owing to strange behaviour of Miss H.
about her bantams. Ah, says Mrs. S., it wasn't only <i>bantams</i> was at the
bottom of it, there's two sides to every question. (There are at least twenty
to this one, by the time we've done with it.)</p>

</center>
<p>Sudden appearance of our Vicar's wife, who says apologetically that she made
a mistake in the time. I beg her to take the chair. She refuses. I insist. She
says No, no, positively not, and takes it.</p>
<p>We begin all over again, but general attitude towards Lent much less
elastic.</p>
<p>Meeting ends at about five o'clock. Our Vicar's wife walks home with me,
and tells me that I look tired. I ask her to come in and have tea. No, she
says, no, it's too kind of me, but she must go on to the far end of the parish.
She remains standing at the gate telling me about old Small&mdash;eighty-six a great
age&mdash;till quarter-to-six, when she departs, saying that she cannot <i>think</i>
why I am looking so tired.</p>
<p><i>February 11th.</i>&mdash;Robin writes again about cigarette-cards. I send him
all those I have collected, and Vicky produces two which she has obtained from
the garden-boy. Find that this quest grows upon one, and am apt now, when in
Plymouth or any other town, to scan gutters, pavements, and tram-floors in
search of Curious Beaks, Famous Football Players, and the like. Have even gone
so far as to implore perfect stranger, sitting opposite me in train, <i>not</i>
to throw cigarette-card out of the window, but give it to me instead. Perfect
stranger does so with an air of courteous astonishment, and as he asks for no
explanation, am obliged to leave him under the impression that I have merely
been trying to force him into conversation with me.</p>
<p>(<i>Note:</i> Could not short article, suitable for <i>Time and Tide</i>, be
worked up on some such lines as: Lengths to which Mother-love may legitimately
go? On second thoughts abandon the idea, as being faintly reminiscent of
<i>d&eacute;mod&eacute;</i> enquiry: Do Shrimps make Good Mothers?)</p>
<p>Hear that Lady Boxe has returned from South of France and is entertaining
house-party. She sends telephone message by the butler, asking me to tea
to-morrow. I accept. (Why?)</p>
<p><i>February 12th.</i>&mdash;Insufferable behaviour of Lady B. Find large party,
all of whom are directed at front door to go to the Hard Courts, where, under
inadequate shelter, in Arctic temperature, all are compelled to watch young men
in white flannels keeping themselves warm by banging a little ball against a
wall. Lady B. wears an emerald-green leather coat with fur collar and cuffs. I,
having walked down, have on ordinary coat and skirt, and freeze rapidly. Find
myself next unknown lady who talks wistfully about the tropics. Can well
understand this. On other side elderly gentleman, who says conversationally
that this Naval Disarmament is All his Eye. This contribution made to
contemporary thought, he says no more. Past five o'clock before we are allowed
to go in to tea, by which time am only too well aware that my face is blue and
my hands purple. Lady B. asks me at tea how the children are, and adds, to the
table at large, that I am "A Perfect Mother". Am naturally avoided,
conversationally, after this, by everybody at the tea-table. Later on, Lady B.
tells us about South of France. She quotes repartees made by herself in French,
and then translates them.</p>

</center>
<p>(Unavoidable Query presents itself here: Would a verdict of Justifiable
Homicide delivered against their mother affect future careers of children
unfavourably?)</p>
<p>Discuss foreign travel with unknown, but charming, lady in black. We are
delighted with one another&mdash;or so I confidently imagine&mdash;arid she begs me to go
and see her if I am ever in her neighbourhood. I say that I will&mdash;but am well
aware that courage will fail me when it comes to the point. Pleasant sense of
mutual sympathy suddenly and painfully shattered by my admitting&mdash;in reply to
direct enquiry&mdash;that I am <i>not</i> a gardener&mdash;which the lady in black is, to
an extent that apparently amounts to monomania. She remains charming, but quite
ceases to be delighted with me, and I feel discouraged.</p>
<p>(<i>N.B.</i> <i>Must</i> try to remember that Social Success is seldom the
portion of those who habitually live in the provinces. No doubt they serve some
other purpose in the vast field of Creation&mdash;but have not yet discovered
what.)</p>
<p>Lady B. asks if I have seen the new play at the Royalty. I say No. She says
Have I been to the Italian Art Exhibition? I have not. She enquires what I
think of <i>Her Privates We</i>&mdash;which I haven't yet read&mdash;and I at once give
her a long and spirited account of my reactions to it. Feel after this that I
had better go, before I am driven to further excesses.</p>
<p>Shall she, says Lady B., ring for my car? Refrain from replying that no
amount of ringing will bring my car to the door all by itself, and say instead
that I walked. Lady B. exclaims that this is Impossible, and that I am Too
Marvellous, Altogether. Take my leave before she can add that I am such a
Perfect Countrywoman, which I feel is coming next.</p>
<p>Get home&mdash;still chilled to the bone owing to enforced detention at Hard
Court&mdash;and tell Robert what I think of Lady B. He makes no answer, but I feel
he agrees.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle says: "Tiens! Madame a mauvaise mine. On dirait un
cadavre..."</p>
<p>Feel that this is kindly meant, but do not care about the picture that it
conjures up.</p>
<p>Say good-night to Vicky, looking angelic in bed, and ask what she is
thinking about, lying there. She disconcertingly replies with briskness: "Oh,
Kangaroos and things."</p>
<p>(<i>Note:</i> The workings of the infant mind very, very difficult to
follow, sometimes. Mothers by no means infallible.)</p>
<p><i>February 14th.</i>&mdash;Have won first prize in <i>Time and Tide</i>
competition, but again divided. Am very angry indeed, and write excellent
letter to the Editor under false name, protesting against this iniquitous
custom. After it has gone, become seriously uneasy under the fear that the use
of a false name is illegal. Look through <i>Whitaker</i>, but can find nothing
but Stamp Duties and Concealment of Illegitimate Births, so abandon it in
disgust.</p>
<p>Write to Angela&mdash;under my own name&mdash;to enquire kindly if <i>she</i> went in
for the competition. Hope she did, and that she will have the decency to say
so.</p>
<p><i>February 16th.</i>&mdash;Informed by Ethel, as she calls me in the morning,
that Helen Wills has had six kittens, of which five survive.</p>
<p>Cannot imagine how I shall break this news to Robert. Reflect&mdash;not for the
first time&mdash;that the workings of Nature are most singular.</p>
<p>Angela writes that she <i>didn't</i> go in for competition, thinking the
subject puerile, but that she solved "Merope's" Crossword puzzle in fifteen
minutes.</p>
<p>(<i>N.B.</i> This last statement almost certainly inaccurate.)</p>
<p><i>February 21st.</i>&mdash;Remove bulb-bowls, with what is left of bulbs, to
greenhouse. Tell Robert that I hope to do better another year. He replies,
Another year, better not waste my money. This reply depresses me, moreover
weather continues Arctic, and have by no means recovered from effects of Lady
B.'s so-called hospitality.</p>
<p>Vicky and Mademoiselle spend much time in boot-cupboard, where Helen Wills
is established with five kittens. Robert still unaware of what has happened,
but cannot hope this ignorance will continue. Must, however, choose suitable
moment for revelation&mdash;which is unlikely to occur today owing to bath-water
having been cold again this morning.</p>
<p>Lady B. calls in the afternoon&mdash;not, as might have been expected, to see if
I am in bed with pneumonia, but to ask if I will help at a Bazaar early in May.
Further enquiry reveals that it is in aid of the Party Funds. I say What Party?
(Am well aware of Lady B.'s political views, but resent having it taken for
granted that mine are the same&mdash;which they are not.)</p>
<p>Lady B. says she is Surprised. Later on she says Look at the Russians, and
even, Look at the Pope. I find myself telling her to Look at Unemployment&mdash;none
of which gets us any further. Am relieved when tea comes in, and still more so
when Lady B. says she really mustn't wait, as she has to call on such a number
of Tenants. She asks after Robert, and I think seriously of replying that he is
out receiving the Oath of Allegiance from all the vassals on the estate, but
decide that this would be undignified.</p>
<p>Escort Lady B. to the hall-door. She tells me that the oak dresser would
look better on the other side of the hall, and that it is a mistake to put
mahogany and walnut in the same room. Her last word is that she will Write,
about the bazaar. Relieve my feelings by waving small red flag belonging to
Vicky, which is lying on the hall-stand, and saying <i>A la lanterne</i>! as
chauffeur drives off. Rather unfortunately, Ethel chooses this moment to walk
through the hall. She says nothing, but looks astonished.</p>
<p><i>February 22nd.</i>&mdash;Gloom prevails, owing to Helen Wills having elected,
with incredible idiocy, to introduce progeny, one by one, to Robert's notice at
late hour last night, when he was making final round of the house.</p>
<p>Send Mademoiselle and Vicky on errand to the village whilst massacre of the
innocents takes place in pail of water in backyard. Small ginger is allowed to
survive. Spend much time in thinking out plausible story to account to Vicky
for disappearance of all the rest. Mademoiselle, when informed privately of
what has happened, tells me to leave Vicky to her&mdash;which I gladly agree to
do&mdash;and adds that "les hommes manquent de coeur". Feel that this is leading us
in the direction of a story which I have heard before, and do not wish to hear
again, regarding <i>un mariage &eacute;chou&eacute;</i> arranged years ago for
Mademoiselle by her parents, in which negotiations broke down owing to
mercenary attitude of <i>le futur</i>. Break in with hasty enquiry regarding
water-tightness or otherwise of Vicky's boots.</p>
<p>(Query: Does incessant pressure of domestic cares vitiate capacity for human
sympathy? Fear that it does, but find myself unable to attempt reformation in
this direction at present.)</p>
<p>Receive long, and in parts illegible, letter from Cissie Crabbe, bearing on
the back of the envelope extraordinary enquiry: Do you know of a really
<i>good</i> hotel Manageress? Combat strong inclination to reply on a postcard:
No, but can recommend thoroughly reliable Dentist. Dear Cissie, one remembers
from old schooldays, has very little sense of humour.</p>
<p><i>February 24th.</i>&mdash;Robert and I lunch with our Member and his wife. I
sit next elderly gentleman who talks about stag-hunting and tells me that there
is Nothing Cruel about it. The Stag <i>likes</i> it, and it is an honest,
healthy, thoroughly <i>English</i> form of sport. I say Yes, as anything else
would be waste of breath, and turn to Damage done by recent storms, New
arrivals in the neighbourhood, and Golf-links at Budleigh Salterton. Find that
we get back to stag-hunting again in next to no time, and remain there for the
rest of lunch.</p>

</center>
<p>Can hear Robert's neighbour, sitting opposite in cochineal three-piece suit,
telling him about her Chilblains. Robert civil, but does not appear unduly
concerned. (Perhaps three-piece cochineal thinks that he is one of those people
who feel more than they can express?) She goes on to past appendicitis, present
sciatica, and threat of colitis in the near future. Robert still unmoved.</p>
<p>Ladies retire to the drawing-room and gather round quite inadequate fire.
Coffee. I perform my usual sleight-of-hand, transferring large piece of
candy-sugar from saucer to handbag, for Vicky's benefit. (Query: Why do people
living in same neighbourhood as myself obtain without difficulty minor luxuries
that I am totally unable to procure? Reply to this, if pursued to logical
conclusion, appears to point to inadequate housekeeping on my part.)</p>
<p>Entrance of males. I hear my neighbour at lunch beginning all over again
about stag-hunting, this time addressed to his hostess, who is well-known
supporter of the R.S.P.C.A.</p>
<p>Our Member talks to me about Football. I say that I think well of the
French, and that B&eacute;hot&eacute;guy plays a good game. (<i>N.B.</i> This
solitary piece of knowledge always coming in useful, but <i>must</i> try and
find out name of at least one British player, so as to vary it.)</p>
<p>As we take our leave with customary graceful speeches, clasp of handbag
unfortunately gives way, and piece of candy-sugar falls, with incredible noise
and violence, on to the parquet, and is pursued with officious zeal and
determination by all present except myself.</p>
<p>Very, very difficult moment...</p>
<p>Robert, on the whole, takes this well, merely enquiring on the way home if I
suppose that we shall ever be asked inside the house again.</p>
<p><i>February 28th.</i>&mdash;Notice, and am gratified by, appearance of large
clump of crocuses near the front gate. Should like to make whimsical and
charming reference to these, and try to fancy myself as "Elizabeth of the
German Garden", but am interrupted by Cook, saying that the Fish is here, but
he's only brought cod and haddock, and the haddock doesn't smell any too fresh,
so what about cod?</p>
<p>Have often noticed that Life is like that.</p>
<p><i>March 1st.</i>&mdash;The Kellways lunch with us, before going on all together
to wedding of Rosemary H., daughter of mutual friend and neighbour. Fire
refuses to burn up, and am still struggling with it when they arrive, with
small boy, Vicky's contemporary&mdash;all three frozen with cold. I say, Do come and
get warm! and they accept this, alas meaningless, offer with enthusiasm. Vicky
rushes in, and am struck, as usual, by the complete and utter straightness of
her hair in comparison with that of practically every other child in the world.
(Little Kellway has natural wave.)</p>
<p>Chickens over-done, and potatoes underdone. Meringues quite a success,
especially with the children, though leading to brisk <i>sotto-voce</i>
encounter between Vicky and Mademoiselle on question of second helping. This
ends by an appeal from Mademoiselle for "un bon mouvement" on Vicky's
part&mdash;which she facilitates by summarily removing her plate, spoon, and fork.
Everybody ignores this drama, with the exception of the infant Kellway, who
looks amused, and unblenchingly attacks a second meringue.</p>
<p>Start directly after lunch, Robert and Mary's husband appearing in a highly
unnatural state of shiny smartness with a top-hat apiece. Effect of this
splendour greatly mitigated, when they don the top-hats, by screams of
unaffected amusement from both children. We drive off, leaving them leaning
against Mademoiselle, apparently helpless with mirth.</p>
<p>(Query: Is not the inferiority complex, about which so much is written and
spoken, nowadays shifting from the child to the parent?)</p>
<p>Mary wears blue with admirable diamond ornament, and looks nice. I wear red,
and think regretfully of great-aunt's diamond ring, still reposing in back
street of Plymouth, under care of old friend the pawnbroker. (<i>Note:</i>
Financial situation very low indeed, and must positively take steps to send
assortment of old clothes to second-hand dealer for disposal. Am struck by
false air of opulence with which I don fur coat, white gloves, and new
shoes&mdash;one very painful&mdash;and get into the car. Irony of life thus
exemplified.)</p>
<p>Charming wedding, Rosemary H. looks lovely, bridesmaids highly picturesque.
One of them has bright red hair, and am completely paralysed by devastating
enquiry from Mary's husband, who hisses at me through his teeth: <i>Is that the
colour yours was when you dyed it?</i></p>
<p>Crowds of people at the reception. Know most of them, but am startled by
strange lady in pink, wearing eye-glasses, who says that I don't remember
her&mdash;which is only too true&mdash;but that she has played tennis at my house. How,
she says, are those sweet twins? Find myself telling her that they are very
well indeed, before I know where I am. Can only trust never to set eyes on her
again.</p>
<p>Exchange talk with Mrs. Somers, recent arrival to the neighbourhood, who
apologises profusely for never having returned my call. Am in doubt whether to
say that I haven't noticed the omission, or that I hope she will repair it as
quickly as possible. Either sounds uncivil.</p>
<p>Speak to old Lady Dufford, who reminds me that the last time we met was at
the Jones wedding. <i>That</i>, she says, came to grief within a year. She also
asks if I have heard about the Greens, who have separated, and poor Winifred
R., who has had to go back to her parents because He drinks. Am not surprised
when she concludes with observation that it is rather <i>heartrending</i> to
see the two young things setting out together.</p>
<p>Large car belonging to bridegroom draws up at hall-door, and old Lady D.
further wags her head at me and says Ah, in <i>our</i> day it would have been a
carriage and pair&mdash;to which I offer no assent, thinking it very unnecessary
reminder of the flight of Time&mdash;and in any event, am Lady D.'s junior by a good
many years.</p>
<p>Melancholy engendered by the whole of this conversation is lightened by
glass of champagne. I ask Robert, sentimentally, if this makes him think of
<i>our</i> wedding. He looks surprised and says No, not particularly, why
should it? As I cannot at the moment think of any particular reply to this, the
question drops.</p>

"0800661h-images/0800661h-09.jpg"></p>
</center>
<p>Departure of the bridal couple is followed by general exodus, and I take the
Kellways home to tea.</p>
<p>Remove shoes with great thankfulness.</p>
<p><i>March 3rd.</i>&mdash;Vicky, after Halma, enquires abruptly whether, if she
died, I should cry? I reply in the affirmative. But, she says, should I cry
really <i>hard</i>. Should I roar and scream? Decline to commit myself to any
such extravagant demonstrations, at which Vicky displays a tendency to hurt
astonishment. I speak to Mademoiselle and say that I hope she will discourage
anything in Vicky that seems to verge upon the morbid. Mademoiselle requires a
translation of the last word, and, after some consideration, I suggest
d&eacute;natur&eacute;, at which she screams dramatically and crosses herself,
and assures me that if I knew what I was saying, I should "en reculer
d'effroi".</p>
<p>We decide to abandon the subject.</p>
<p>Our Vicar's wife calls for me at seven o'clock, and we go to a neighbouring
Women's Institute at which I have, rather rashly, promised to speak. On the way
there, our Vicar's wife tells me that the secretary of the Institute is liable
to have a heart attack at any minute and must on no account exert herself, or
be allowed to get over-excited. Even a violent fit of laughing, she adds
impressively, might carry her off in a moment.</p>
<p>Hastily revise my speech, and remove from it two funny stories. After this
it is a shock to find that the programme for the evening includes dancing and a
game of General Post. I ask our Vicar's wife what would happen if the secretary
<i>did</i> get a heart attack, and she replies mysteriously, Oh, she always
carries Drops in her handbag. The thing to do is to keep an eye on her handbag.
This I do nervously throughout the evening, but fortunately no crisis
supervenes.</p>
<p>I speak, am thanked, and asked if I will judge a Darning Competition. This I
do, in spite of inward misgivings that few people are less qualified to give
any opinion about darning than I am. I am thanked again and given tea and a
doughnut. We all play General Post and get very heated. Signal success of the
evening when two stout and elderly members collide in the middle of the room,
and both fall heavily to the floor together. This, if anything, will surely
bring on a heart attack, and am prepared to make a rush at the handbag, but
nothing happens. We all sing the National Anthem, and our Vicar's wife says she
does hope the lights of her two-seater are in order, and drives me home. We are
relieved, and surprised, to find that the lights, all except the rear one, are
in order, although rather faint.</p>
<p>I beg our Vicar's wife to come in; she says, No, No, it is far too late,
really, and comes. Robert and Helen Wills both asleep in the drawing-room. Our
Vicar's wife says she must not stay a moment, and we talk about Countrywomen,
Stanley Baldwin, Hotels at Madeira (where none of us have ever been), and other
unrelated topics. Ethel brings in cocoa, but can tell from the way she puts
down the tray that she thinks it an unreasonable requirement, and will quite
likely give notice to-morrow.</p>
<p>At eleven our Vicar's wife says that she <i>does</i> hope the lights of the
two-seater are still in order, and gets as far as the hall-door. There we talk
about forthcoming village concert, parrot-disease, and the Bishop of the
diocese.</p>
<p>Her car refuses to start, and Robert and I push it down the drive. After a
good deal of jerking and grinding, engine starts, the hand of our Vicar's wife
waves at us through the hole in the talc, and car disappears down the lane.</p>
<p>Robert inhospitably says, let us put out the lights and fasten up the
hall-door and go up to bed immediately, in case she comes back for anything. We
do so, only delayed by Helen Wills, whom Robert tries vainly to expel into the
night. She retires under the piano, behind the bookcase, and finally disappears
altogether.</p>
<p><i>March 4th.</i>&mdash;Ethel, as I anticipated, gives notice. Cook says this is
so unsettling, she thinks she had better go too. Despair invades me. Write five
letters to Registry Offices.</p>
<p><i>March 7th.</i>&mdash;No hope.</p>
<p><i>March 8th.</i>&mdash;Cook relents, so far as to say that she will stay until I
am suited. Feel inclined to answer that, in, that case, she had better make up
her mind to a lifetime spent together&mdash;but naturally refrain. Spend exhausting
day in Plymouth chasing mythical house-parlourmaids. Meet Lady B., who says the
servant difficulty, in reality, is non-existent. She has No trouble. It is a
question of knowing how to treat them. Firmness, she says, but at the same time
one must be human. Am I human? she asks. Do I understand that they want
occasional diversion, just as I do myself? I lose my head and reply No, that it
is my custom to keep my servants chained up in the cellar when their work is
done. This flight of satire rather spoilt by Lady B. laughing heartily, and
saying that I am always so amusing. Well, she adds, we shall no doubt see one
another at lunch-time at the Duke of Cornwall Hotel, where alone it is possible
to get a decent meal. I reply with ready cordiality that no doubt we shall, and
go and partake of my usual lunch of baked beans and a glass of water in small
and obscure caf&eacute;.</p>
<p>Unavoidable Query, of painfully searching character, here presents itself:
If Lady B. had invited me as her guest to lunch at the D. of C. Hotel, should I
have accepted? Am conscious of being heartily tired of baked beans and water,
which in any case do not really serve to support one through long day of
shopping and servant-hunting. Moreover, am always ready to See Life, in hotels
or anywhere else. On the other hand, am aware that self-respect would suffer
severely through accepting five-shillings-worth of luncheon from Lady B. Ponder
this problem of psychology in train on the way home, but reach no definite
conclusion.</p>
<p>Day a complete failure as regards house-parlourmaid, but expedition not
wasted, having found two cigarette-cards on pavement, both quite clean Curious
Beaks.</p>
<p><i>March 9th.</i>&mdash;Cannot hear of a house-parlourmaid. Ethel, on the other
hand, can hear of at least a hundred situations, and opulent motor-cars
constantly dash up to front door, containing applicants for her services.
Cook more and more unsettled. If this goes on, shall go to London and stay
with Rose, in order to visit Agencies.</p>
<p>Meet Barbara, wearing new tweed, in village this morning&mdash;nice bright girl,
but long to suggest she should have adenoids removed. She says, Will I be an
Angel and look in on her mother, now practically an invalid? I reply warmly Of
course I will, not really meaning it, but remember that we are now in Lent and
suddenly decide to go at once. Admire the new tweed. Barbara says It <i>is</i>
rather nice, isn't it, and adds&mdash;a little strangely&mdash;that it came out of John
Barker's Sale Catalogue, under four guineas, and only needed letting out at the
waist and taking in a bit on the shoulders. Especially, she adds elliptically,
now that skirts are longer again.</p>
<p>Barbara goes to Evening Service, and I go to look in on her mother, whom I
find in shawls, sitting in an armchair reading&mdash;rather ostentatiously&mdash;enormous
<i>Life of Lord Beaconsfield</i>. I ask how she is, and she shakes her head and
enquires if I should ever guess that her pet name amongst her friends once used
to be Butterfly? (This kind of question always so difficult, as either
affirmative or negative reply apt to sound unsympathetic. Feel it would hardly
do to suggest that Chrysalis, in view of the shawls, would now be more
appropriate.) However, says Mrs. Blenkinsop with a sad smile, it is never her
way to dwell upon herself and her own troubles. She just sits there, day after
day, always ready to sympathise in the little joys and troubles of others, and
I would hardly believe how unfailingly these are brought to her. People say,
she adds deprecatingly, that just her Smile does them good. She does not know,
she says, what they mean. (Neither do I.)</p>
<p>After this, there is a pause, and I feel that Mrs. B. is waiting for me to
pour out my little joys and troubles. Perhaps she hopes that Robert has been
unfaithful to me, or that I have fallen in love with the Vicar.</p>
<center>
<p><a name="0800661h-10" id="0800661h-10"></a><img alt="" src=
"0800661h-images/0800661h-10.jpg"></p>
</center>
<p>Am unable to rise to the occasion, so begin instead to talk about Barbara's
new tweed. Mrs. Blenkinsop at once replies that, for her part, she has never
given up all those little feminine touches that make All the Difference. A
ribbon here, a flower there. This leads to a story about what was once said to
her by a friend, beginning "It's so wonderful, dear Mrs. Blenkinsop, to see the
trouble you always take on behalf of others", and ending with Mrs. B.'s own
reply, to the effect that she is only A Useless Old Woman, but that she has
many, many friends, and that this must be because her motto has always been:
Look Out and Not In: Look Up and not Down: Lend a Hand.</p>
<p>Conversation again languishes, and I have recourse to <i>Lord
Beaconsfield</i>. What, I ask, does Mrs. B. feel about him? She feels, Mrs. B.
replies, that he was a most Remarkable Personality. People have often said to
Mrs. B., Ah, how lonely it must be for you, alone here, when dear Barbara is
out enjoying herself with other young things. But Mrs. B.'s reply to this is
No, no. She is never alone when she has Her Books. Books, to her, are
<i>Friends</i>. Give her Shakespeare or Jane Austen, Meredith or Hardy, and she
is Lost&mdash;lost in a world of her own. She sleeps so little that most of her
nights are spent in reading. Have I any idea, asks Mrs. B., what it is like to
hear every hour, every half-hour, chiming out all through the night? I have no
idea whatever, since am invariably obliged to struggle with overwhelming
sleepiness from nine o'clock onwards, but do not like to tell her this, so take
my departure. Mrs. B.'s parting observation is an expression of thanks to me
for coming to enquire after an old woman, and she is as well as she can hope to
be, at sixty-six years old&mdash;she <i>should</i> say, sixty-six years
<i>young</i>, all her friends tell her.</p>
<p>Reach home totally unbenefited by this visit, and with strange tendency to
snap at everybody I meet.</p>
<p><i>March 10th.</i>&mdash;Still no house-parlourmaid, and write to ask Rose if I
can go to her for a week. Also write to old Aunt Gertrude in Shropshire to
enquire if I may send Vicky and Mademoiselle there on a visit, as this will
make less work in house while we are short-handed. Do not, however, give Aunt
Gertrude this reason for sending them. Ask Robert if he will be terribly
lonely, and he says Oh no, he hopes I shall enjoy myself in London. Spend a
great deal of eloquence explaining that I am <i>not</i> going to London to
enjoy myself, but experience sudden fear that I am resembling Mrs. Blenkinsop,
and stop abruptly.</p>
<p>Robert says nothing.</p>
<p><i>March 11th.</i>&mdash;Rose wires that she will be delighted to put me up.
Cook, very unpleasantly, says, "I'm sure I hope you'll enjoy your holiday,
mum." Am precluded from making the kind of reply I should <i>like</i> to make,
owing to grave fears that she should also give notice. Tell her instead that I
hope to "get settled" with a house-parlourmaid before my return. Cook looks
utterly incredulous and says she is sure she hopes so too, because really,
things have been so unsettled lately. Pretend not to hear this and leave the
kitchen.</p>
<p>Look through my clothes and find that I have nothing whatever to wear in
London. Read in <i>Daily Mirror</i> that all evening dresses are worn long, and
realise with horror that not one of mine comes even half-way down my legs.</p>
<p><i>March 12th.</i>&mdash;Collect major portion of my wardrobe and dispatch to
address mentioned in advertisement pages of <i>Time and Tide</i> as prepared to
pay Highest Prices for Outworn Garments, cheque by return. Have gloomy
foreboding that six penny stamps by return will more adequately represent value
of my contribution, and am thereby impelled to add Robert's old shooting-coat,
mackintosh dating from 1907, and least reputable woollen sweater. Customary
struggle ensues between frank and straightforward course of telling Robert What
I have done, and less straightforward, but more practical, decision to keep
complete silence on the point and let him make discovery for himself after
parcel has left the house. Conscience, as usual, is defeated, but nevertheless
unsilenced.</p>
<p>(Query: Would it not indicate greater strength of character, even if lesser
delicacy of feeling, not to spend so much time on regretting errors of
judgement and of behaviour? Reply almost certainly in the affirmative.
Brilliant, but nebulous, outline of powerful Article for <i>Time and Tide</i>
here suggests itself: <i>Is Ruthlessness more Profitable than Repentance?</i>
Failing article&mdash;for which time at the moment is lacking, owing to departure of
house-parlourmaid and necessity of learning "Wreck of the Hesperus" to recite
at Village Concert&mdash;would this make suitable subject for Debate at Women's
Institute? Feel doubtful as to whether our Vicar's wife would not think
subject-matter trenching upon ground more properly belonging to our Vicar.)</p>
<p>Resign from Book of the Month Club, owing to wide and ever-increasing
divergence of opinion between us as to merits or demerits of recently published
fiction. Write them long and eloquent letter about this, but remember after it
is posted that I still owe them twelve shillings and sixpence for Maurois's
<i>Byron</i>.</p>
<p><i>March 13th.</i>&mdash;Vicky and Mademoiselle leave, in order to pay visit to
Aunt Gertrude. Mademoiselle becomes sentimental and says, "Ah,
d&eacute;j&agrave; je languis pour notre retour!" As total extent of her
absence at this stage is about half-an-hour, and they have three weeks before
them, feel that this is not a spirit to be encouraged. See them into the train,
when Mademoiselle at once produces eau-de-Cologne in case either, or both,
should be ill, and come home again. House resembles the tomb, and the gardener
says that Miss Vicky seems such a little bit of a thing to be sent right away
like that, and it isn't as if she could write and <i>tell</i> me how she was
getting on, either.</p>
<p>Go to bed feeling like a murderess.</p>
<p><i>March 14th.</i>&mdash;Rather inadequate Postal Order arrives, together with
white tennis coat trimmed with rabbit, which&mdash;says accompanying letter&mdash;is
returned as being unsaleable. Should like to know <i>why</i>. Toy with idea of
writing to <i>Time and Tide</i>'s Editor, enquiring if every advertisement is
subjected to personal scrutiny before insertion, but decide that this, in the
event of a reply, might involve me in difficult explanations and diminish my
<i>prestige</i> as occasional recipient of First Prize (divided) in Weekly
Competition.</p>
<p>(<i>Mem</i>.: See whether tennis coat could be dyed and transformed into
evening cloak.)</p>
<p>Am unfortunately found at home by callers, Mr. and Mrs. White, who are
starting a Chicken-farm in the neighbourhood, and appear to have got married on
the expectation of making a fortune out of it. We talk about chickens, houses,
scenery, and the train-service between here and London. I ask if they play
tennis, and politely suggest that both are probably brilliant performers. Mr.
White staggers me by replying Oh, he wouldn't say <i>that</i>, exactly&mdash;meaning
that he would, if it didn't seem like boasting. He enquires about Tournaments.
Mrs. White is reminded of Tournaments in which they have, or have not, come out
victors in the past. They refer to their handicap. Resolve never to ask the
Whites to play on our extremely inferior court.</p>
<p>Later on talk about politicians. Mr. White says that in <i>his</i> opinion
Lloyd George is clever, but Nothing Else. That's <i>all</i>, says Mr. White
impressively. Just Clever. I refer to Coalition Government and Insurance Act,
but Mr. White repeats firmly that both were brought about by mere Cleverness.
He adds that Baldwin is a thoroughly <i>honest</i> man, and that Ramsay
MacDonald is <i>weak</i>. Mrs. White supports him with an irrelevant statement
to the effect that the Labour Party must be hand in glove with Russia,
otherwise how would the Bolshevists dare to go on like that?</p>
<p>She also suddenly adds that Prohibition and the Jews and Everything are
really the thin end of the wedge, don't I think so? I say Yes, I do, as the
quickest way of ending the conversation, and ask if she plays the piano, to
which she says No, but the Ukelele a little bit, and we talk about local shops
and the delivery of a Sunday paper.</p>
<p>(<i>N.B.</i> Amenities of conversation afford very, very curious study
sometimes, especially in the country.)</p>
<p>The Whites take their departure. Hope never to set eyes on either of them
again.</p>
<p><i>March 15th.</i>&mdash;Robert discovers absence of mackintosh dating from 1907.
Says that he would "rather have lost a hundred pounds"&mdash;which I know to be
untrue. Unsuccessful evening follows. Cannot make up my mind whether to tell
him at once about shooting-coat and sweater, and get it all over in one, or
leave him to find out for himself when present painful impression has had time
to die away. Ray of light pierces impenetrable gloom when Robert is driven to
enquire if I can tell him "a word for <i>calmer</i> in seven letters" and I,
after some thought, suggest "<i>serener</i>"&mdash;which he says will do, and
returns to <i>Times</i> Crossword Puzzle. Later he asks for famous mountain in
Greece, but does not accept my too-hasty offer of Mount Atlas, nor listen to
interesting explanation as to associative links between Greece, Hercules, and
Atlas, which I proffer. After going into it at some length, I perceive that
Robert is not attending, and retire to bed.</p>
<p><i>March 17th.</i>&mdash;Travel up to London with Barbara Blenkinsop&mdash;(wearing
new tweed)&mdash;who says she is going to spend a fortnight with old school-friend
at Streatham and is looking forward to the Italian Art Exhibition. I say that I
am, too, and ask after Mrs. B. Barbara says that she is Wonderful. We discuss
Girl Guides, and exchange surmises as to reason why Mrs. T. at the Post Office
is no longer on speaking terms with Mrs. L. at the shop. Later on, conversation
takes a more intellectual turn, and we agree that the Parish Magazine needs
Brightening Up. I suggest a crossword puzzle, and Barbara says a Children's
Page. Paddington is reached just as we decide that it would be hopeless to try
and get a contribution to the Parish Magazine from anyone really <i>good</i>,
such as Shaw, Bennett, or Galsworthy.</p>
<p>I ask Barbara to tea at my club one day next week, she accepts, and we
part.</p>
<p>Met by Rose, who has a new hat, and says that <i>no one</i> is wearing a
brim, which discourages me&mdash;partly because I have nothing <i>but</i> brims, and
partly because I know only too well that I shall look my worst without one.
Confide this fear to Rose, who says, Why not go to well-known Beauty Culture
Establishment, and have course of treatment there? I look at myself in the
glass, see much room for improvement, and agree to this, only stipulating that
all shall be kept secret as the grave, as could not tolerate the idea of Lady
B.'s comments, should she ever come to hear of it. Make appointment by
telephone. In the meantime, says Rose, what about the Italian Art Exhibition?
She herself has already been four times. I say Yes, yes&mdash;it is one of the
things I have come to London <i>for</i>, but should prefer to go earlier in the
day. Then, says Rose, the first thing tomorrow morning? To this I reply, with
every sign of reluctance, that to-morrow morning <i>must</i> be devoted to
Registry Offices. Well, says Rose, when <i>shall</i> we go? Let us, I urge,
settle that a little later on, when I know better what I am doing. Can see that
Rose thinks anything but well of me, but she is too tactful to say more. Quite
realise that I shall have to go to the Italian Exhibition sooner or later, and
am indeed quite determined to do so, but feel certain that I shall understand
nothing about it when I do get there, and shall find myself involved in
terrible difficulties when asked my impressions afterwards.</p>
<p>Rose's cook, as usual, produces marvellous dinner, and I remember with shame
and compassion that Robert, at home, is sitting down to minced beef and
macaroni cheese, followed by walnuts.</p>
<p>Rose says that she is taking me to dinner to-morrow, with distinguished
woman-writer who has marvellous collection of Jade, to meet still more
distinguished Professor (female) and others. Decide to go and buy an evening
dress to-morrow, regardless of overdraft.</p>
<p><i>March 18th.</i>&mdash;Very successful day, although Italian Art Exhibition
still unvisited. (Mem.: Positively <i>must</i> go there before meeting Barbara
for tea at my club.)</p>
<p>Visit several Registry Offices, and am told that maids do not like the
country&mdash;which I know already&mdash;and that the wages I am offering are low. Come
away from there depressed, and decide to cheer myself up by purchasing evening
dress&mdash;which I cannot afford&mdash;with present-day waist&mdash;which does not suit me.
Select the Brompton Road, as likely to contain what I want, and crawl up it,
scrutinising windows. Come face-to-face with Barbara Blenkinsop, who says,
<i>How</i> extraordinary we should meet here, to which I reply that that is so
often the way, when one comes to London. She is, she tells me, just on her way
to the Italian Exhibition...I at once say Good-bye, and plunge into elegant
establishment with expensive-looking garments in the window.</p>
<p>Try on five dresses, but find judgement of their merits very difficult, as
hair gets wilder and wilder, and nose more devoid of powder. Am also worried by
extraordinary and tactless tendency of saleswoman to emphasise the fact that
all the colours I like are very trying by daylight, but will be less so at
night. Finally settle on silver tissue with large bow, stipulate for its
immediate delivery, am told that this is impossible, reluctantly agree to carry
it away with me in cardboard box, and go away wondering if it wouldn't have
been better to choose the black chiffon instead.</p>
<p>Hope that Beauty Parlour experiment may enhance self-respect, at present at
rather low ebb, but am cheered by going into Fuller's and sending boxes of
chocolates to Robin and Vicky respectively. Add peppermint creams for
Mademoiselle by an afterthought, as otherwise she may find herself
<i>bless&eacute;e</i>. Lunch on oxtail soup, lobster mayonnaise, and cup of
coffee, as being menu furthest removed from that obtainable at home.</p>
<p>Beauty Parlour follows. Feel that a good deal could be written on this
experience, and even contemplate&mdash;in connection with recent observations
exchanged between Barbara B. and myself&mdash;brightening the pages of our Parish
Magazine with result of my reflections, but on second thoughts abandon this, as
unlikely to appeal to the Editor (Our Vicar).</p>
<p>Am received by utterly terrifying person with dazzling complexion,
indigo-blue hair, and orange nails, presiding over reception room downstairs,
but eventually passed on to extremely pretty little creature with auburn bob
and charming smile. Am reassured. Am taken to discreet curtained cubicle and
put into long chair. Subsequent operations, which take hours and hours, appear
to consist of the removal of hundreds of layers of dirt from my face. (These
discreetly explained away by charming operator as the result of "acidity".) She
also plucks away portions of my eyebrows. Very, very painful operation.</p>
<p>Eventually emerge more or less unrecognisable, and greatly improved. Lose my
head, and buy Foundation Cream, rouge, powder, lip-stick. Foresee grave
difficulty in reconciling Robert to the use of these appliances, but decide not
to think about this for the present.</p>
<p>Go back to Rose's flat in time to dress for dinner. She tells me that she
spent the afternoon at the Italian Exhibition.</p>
<p><i>March 19th.</i>&mdash;Rose takes me to dine with talented group of her
friends, connected with Feminist Movement. I wear new frock, and for once in my
life am satisfied with my appearance (but still regret great-aunt's diamond
ring, now brightening pawnbroker's establishment back-street Plymouth). Am,
however, compelled to make strong act of will in order to banish all
recollection of bills that will subsequently come in from Beauty Parlour and
dressmaker. Am able to succeed in this largely owing to charms of distinguished
Feminists, all as kind as possible. Well-known Professor&mdash;(concerning whom I
have previously consulted Rose as to the desirability of reading up something
about Molecules or other kindred topic, for conversational
purposes)&mdash;completely overcomes me by producing, with a charming smile, two
cigarette-cards, as she has heard that I collect them for Robin. After this,
throw all idea of Molecules to the winds, and am happier for the rest of the
evening in consequence.</p>
<p>Editor of well-known literary weekly also present, and actually remembers
that we met before at Literary Club dinner. I discover, towards the end of the
dinner, that she has not visited the Italian Exhibition&mdash;and give Rose a look
that I hope she takes to heart.</p>
<p>Cocktails, and wholly admirable dinner, further brighten the evening. I sit
next Editor, and she rather rashly encourages me to give my opinion of her
paper. I do so freely, thanks to cocktail and Editor's charming manners, which
combine to produce in me the illusion that my words are witty, valuable, and
thoroughly well worth listening to. (Am but too well aware that later in the
night I shall wake up in cold sweat, and view this scene in retrospect with
very different feelings as to my own part in it.)</p>
<p>Rose and I take our leave just before midnight, sharing taxi with very
well-known woman dramatist. (Should much like Lady B. to know this, and have
every intention of making casual mention to her of it at earliest possible
opportunity.)</p>
<p><i>March 20th.</i>&mdash;More Registry Offices, less success than ever.</p>
<p>Barbara Blenkinsop comes to tea with me at my club, and says that Streatham
is very gay, and that her friends took her to a dance last night and a Mr.
Crosbie Carruthers drove her home afterwards in his car. We then talk about
clothes&mdash;dresses all worn long in the evening&mdash;this graceful, but not
hygienic&mdash;women will never again submit to long skirts in the day-time&mdash;most
people growing their hair&mdash;but eventually Barbara reverts to Mr. C. C. and asks
if I think a girl makes herself cheap by allowing a man friend to take her out
to dinner in Soho? I say No, not at all, and inwardly decide that Vicky would
look nice as bridesmaid in blue taffetas, with little wreath of Banksia
roses.</p>
<p>A letter from dear Robin, forwarded from home, arrives to-night. He says,
wouldn't a motor tour in the Easter holidays be great fun, and a boy at school
called Briggs is going on one. (Briggs is the only son of millionaire parents,
owning two Rolls-Royces and any number of chauffeurs.) Feel that it would be
unendurable to refuse this trustful request, and decide that I can probably
persuade Robert into letting me drive the children to the far side of the
county in the old Standard. Can call this modest expedition a motor tour if we
stay the night at a pub. and return the next day.</p>
<p>At the same time realise that, financial situation being what it is, and
moreover time rapidly approaching when great-aunt's diamond ring must either be
redeemed, or relinquished for ever, there is nothing for it but to approach
Bank on subject of an overdraft.</p>
<p>Am never much exhilarated at this prospect, and do not in the least find
that it becomes less unpleasant with repetition, but rather the contrary.
Experience customary difficulty in getting to the point, and Bank Manager and I
discuss weather, political situation, and probable Starters for the Grand
National with passionate suavity for some time. Inevitable pause occurs, and we
look at one another across immense expanse of pink blotting-paper. Irrelevant
impulse rises in me to ask if he has other supply, for use, in writing-table
drawer, or if fresh pad is brought in whenever a client calls. (Strange
divagations of the human brain under the stress of extreme nervousness presents
itself here as interesting topic for speculation. Should like to hear opinion
of Professor met last night on this point. Subject far preferable to
Molecules.)</p>
<p>Long, and rather painful, conversation follows. Bank Manager kind, but if he
says the word "security" once, he certainly says it twenty times. Am, myself,
equally insistent with "temporary accommodation only", which I think sounds
thoroughly businesslike, and at the same time optimistic as to speedy
repayment. Just as I think we are over the worst, Bank Manager reduces me to
spiritual pulp by suggesting that we should see how the Account Stands at the
Moment. Am naturally compelled to agree to this with air of well-bred and
detached amusement, but am in reality well aware that the Account Stands&mdash;or,
more accurately, totters&mdash;on a Debit Balance of Thirteen Pounds, two shillings,
and tenpence. Large sheet of paper, bearing this impressive statement, is
presently brought in and laid before us.</p>
<p>Negotiations resumed.</p>
<p>Eventually emerge into the street with purpose accomplished, but feeling
completely unstrung for the day. Rose is kindness personified, produces Bovril
and an excellent lunch, and agrees with me that it is All Nonsense to say that
Wealth wouldn't mean Happiness, because we know quite well that it
<i>would</i>.</p>
<p><i>March 21st.</i>&mdash;Express to Rose serious fear that I shall lose my reason
if no house-parlourmaid materialises. Rose, as usual, sympathetic, but can
suggest nothing that I have not already tried. We go to a Sale in order to
cheer ourselves up, and I buy yellow linen tennis-frock&mdash;&pound;1 9s. 6d.&mdash;on
strength of newly-arranged overdraft, but subsequently suffer from the
conviction that I am taking the bread out of the mouths of Robin and Vicky.</p>
<p>Rather painful moment occurs when I suggest the Italian Exhibition to Rose,
who replies&mdash;after a peculiar silence&mdash;that it is now <i>over</i>. Can think of
nothing whatever to say, and do not care for dear Rose's expression, so begin
at once to discuss new novels with as much intelligence as I can muster.</p>
<p><i>March 22nd.</i>&mdash;Completely amazed by laconic postcard from Robert to say
that local Registry Office can supply us with house-parlour<i>man</i>, and if I
am experiencing difficulty in finding anyone, had we not better engage him? I
telegraph back Yes, and then feel that I have made a mistake, but Rose says No,
and refuses to let me rush out and telegraph again, for which, on subsequent
calmer reflection, I feel grateful to her&mdash;and am sure that Robert would be
still more so, owing to well-authenticated masculine dislike of telegrams.</p>
<p>Spend the evening writing immense letter to Robert enclosing list of duties
of house-parlourman. (Jib at thought of being called by him in the mornings
with early tea, and consult Rose, who says boldly, Think of waiters in Foreign
Hotels!&mdash;which I do, and am reminded at once of many embarrassing episodes
which I would rather forget.) Also send detailed instructions to Robert
regarding the announcement of this innovation to Cook. Rose again takes up
modern and fearless attitude, and says that Cook, mark her words, will be
delighted.</p>
<p>I spend much of the night thinking over the whole question of running the
house successfully, and tell myself&mdash;not by any means for the first time&mdash;that
my abilities are very, very deficient in this direction. Just as the
realisation of this threatens to overwhelm me altogether, I fall asleep.</p>

"0800661h-images/0800661h-11.jpg"></p>
</center>
<p><i>March 25th.</i>&mdash;Return home, to Robert, Helen Wills, and new
house-parlourman, who is&mdash;I now learn for the first time&mdash;named Fitzsimmons. I
tell Robert that it is impossible that he should be called this. Robert
replies, Why not? Can only say that if Robert cannot see this for himself,
explanation will be useless. Then, says Robert, no doubt we can call him by his
first name. This, on investigation, turns out to be Howard. Find myself quite
unable to cope with any of it, and the whole situation is met by my never
calling the house-parlourman anything at all except "you" and speaking of him
to Robert as "Howard Fitzsimmons", in inverted commas as though intending to be
funny. Very unsatisfactory solution.</p>
<p>Try to tell Robert all about London&mdash;(with exception of Italian Exhibition,
which I do not mention)&mdash;but Aladdin lamp flares up, which interferes, and have
also to deal with correspondence concerning Women's Institute Monthly Meeting,
replacement of broken bedroom tumblers&mdash;attributed to Ethel&mdash;disappearance of
one pyjama-jacket and two table-napkins in the wash, and instructions to Howard
Fitzs. concerning his duties. (<i>Mem</i>.: Must certainly make it
crystal-clear that acceptable formula, when receiving an order, is not
"Right-oh!" Cannot, at the moment, think how to word this, but must work it
out, and then deliver with firmness and precision.)</p>
<p>Robert very kind about London, but perhaps rather more interested in my
having met Barbara Blenkinsop&mdash;which, after all, I can do almost any day in the
village&mdash;than in my views on <i>Nine till Six</i> (the best play I have seen
for ages) or remarkable increase of traffic in recent years. Tell Robert by
degrees about my new clothes. He asks when I expect to wear them, and I reply
that one never knows&mdash;which is only too true&mdash;and conversation closes.</p>
<p>Write long letter to Angela, for the express purpose of referring casually
to Rose's distinguished friends, met in London.</p>
<p><i>March 27th.</i>&mdash;Angela replies to my letter, but says little about
distinguished society in which I have been moving, and asks for full account of
my impressions of Italian Exhibition. She and William, she says, went up on
purpose to see it, and visited it three times. Can only say&mdash;but do not, of
course, do so&mdash;that William must have been dragged there by the hair of his
head.</p>
<p><i>March 28th.</i>&mdash;Read admirable, but profoundly discouraging, article in
<i>Time and Tide</i> relating to Bernard Shaw's women, but applying to most of
us. Realise&mdash;not for the first time&mdash;that intelligent women can perhaps best
perform their duty towards their own sex by devastating process of telling them
the truth about themselves. At the same time, cannot feel that I shall really
enjoy hearing it. Ultimate paragraph of article, moreover, continues to haunt
me most unpleasantly with reference to own undoubted vulnerability where Robin
and Vicky are concerned. Have very often wondered if Mothers are not rather A
Mistake altogether, and now definitely come to the conclusion that they
<i>are</i>.</p>
<p>Interesting speculation as to how they might best be replaced interrupted by
necessity of seeing that Fitzs. is turning out spare-bedroom according to
instructions. Am unspeakably disgusted at finding him sitting in spare-room
armchair, with feet on the window-sill. He says that he is "not feeling very
well". Am much more taken aback than he is, and lose my head to the extent of
replying: "Then go and be it in your own room." Realise afterwards that this
might have been better worded.</p>
<p><i>April 2nd.</i>&mdash;Barbara calls. Can she, she says, speak to me in
<i>confidence?</i> I assure her that she can, and at once put Helen Wills and
kitten out of the window in order to establish confidential atmosphere. Sit,
seething with excitement, in the hope that I am at least going to be told that
Barbara is engaged. Try to keep this out of sight, and to maintain expression
of earnest and sympathetic attention only, whilst Barbara says that it is
sometimes very difficult to know which way Duty lies, that she has always
thought a true woman's highest vocation is home-making, and that the love of a
Good Man is the crown of life. I say Yes, Yes, to all of this. (Discover, on
thinking it over, that I do not agree with any of it, and am shocked at my own
extraordinary duplicity.)</p>
<p>Barbara at length admits that Crosbie has asked her to marry him&mdash;he did it,
she says, at the Zoo&mdash;and go out with him as his wife to the Himalayas. This,
says Barbara, is where all becomes difficult. She may be old-fashioned&mdash;no
doubt she is&mdash;but can she leave her mother alone? No, she cannot. Can she, on
the other hand, give up dear Crosbie, who has never loved a girl before, and
says that he never will again? No, she cannot.</p>

"0800661h-images/0800661h-12.jpg"></p>
</center>
<p>Barbara weeps. I kiss her. Howard Fitzsimmons selects this moment to walk in
with the tea, at which I sit down again in confusion and begin to talk about
the Vicarage daffodils being earlier than ours, just as Barbara launches into
the verdict in the Podmore Case. We gyrate uneasily in and out of these topics
while Howard Fitzsimmons completes his preparations for tea. Atmosphere ruined,
and destruction completed by my own necessary enquiries as to Barbara's wishes
in the matter of milk, sugar, bread-and-butter, and so on. (<i>Mem</i>.: Must
speak to Cook about sending in minute segment of sponge-cake, remains of one
which, to my certain recollection, made its first appearance more than ten days
ago. Also, why perpetual and unappetising procession of small rock-cakes?)</p>
<p>Robert comes in, he talks of swine-fever, all further confidences become
impossible. Barbara takes her leave immediately after tea, only asking if I
could look in on her mother and have a Little Talk? I reluctantly agree to do
so, and she mounts her bicycle and rides off. Robert says, That girl holds
herself well, but it's a pity she has those ankles.</p>
<p><i>April 4th.</i>&mdash;Go to see old Mrs. Blenkinsop. She is, as usual, swathed
in shawls, but has exchanged <i>Lord Beaconsfield</i> for <i>Froude and
Carlyle</i>. She says that I am very good to come and see a poor old woman, and
that she often wonders how it is that so many of the younger generation seem to
find their way to her by instinct. Is it, she suggests, because her
<i>heart</i> has somehow kept young, in spite of her grey hair and wrinkles,
ha-ha-ha, and so she has always been able to find the Silver Lining, she is
thankful to say. I circuitously approach the topic of Barbara. Mrs. B. at once
says that the young are very hard and selfish. This is natural, perhaps, but it
saddens her. Not on her own account&mdash;no, no, no&mdash;but because she cannot bear to
think of what Barbara will have to suffer from remorse when it is Too Late.</p>
<p>Feel a strong inclination to point out that this is <i>not</i> finding the
Silver Lining, but refrain. Long monologue from old Mrs. B. follows. Main
points that emerge are: (a) That Mrs. B. has not got very many more years to
spend amongst us; (b) that all her life has been given up to others, but that
she deserves no credit for this, as it is just the way she is made; (c) that
all she wants is to see her Barbara happy, and it matters nothing at all that
she herself should be left alone and helpless in her old age, and no one is to
give a thought to that for a moment. Finally, that it has never been her way to
think of herself or of her own feelings. People have often said to her that
they believe she <i>has</i> no self&mdash;simply, none at all.</p>
<p>Pause, which I do not attempt to fill, ensues.</p>
<p>We return to Barbara, and Mrs. B. says it is very natural that a girl should
be wrapped up in her own little concerns. I feel that we are getting no
further, and boldly introduce the name of Crosbie Carruthers. Terrific effect
on Mrs. B., who puts her hand on her heart, leans back, and begins to gasp and
turn blue. She is sorry, she pants, to be so foolish, but it is now many nights
since she has had any sleep at all, and the strain is beginning to tell. I must
forgive her. I hastily do forgive her, and depart.</p>
<p>Very, very unsatisfactory interview.</p>
<p>Am told, on my way home, by Mrs. S. of the <i>Cross and Keys</i>, that a
gentleman is staying there who is said to be engaged to Miss Blenkinsop, but
the old lady won't hear of it, and he seems such a nice gentleman too, though
perhaps not quite as young as some, and do I think the Himalayas would be All
Right if there was a baby coming along? Exchange speculations and comments with
Mrs. S. for some time before recollecting that the whole thing is supposed to
be private, and that in any case gossip is undesirable.</p>
<p>Am met at home by Mademoiselle with intelligent enquiry as to the prospects
of Miss Blenkinsop's immediate marriage, and the attitude adopted by old Mrs.
B. "Le coeur d'une m&egrave;re," says Mademoiselle sentimentally. Even the
infant Vicky suddenly demands if that gentleman at the <i>Cross and Keys</i> is
really Miss Blenkinsop's True Love? At this, Mademoiselle screams, "Ah, mon
Dieu, ces enfants anglais!" and is much upset at impropriety of Vicky's
language.</p>
<p>Even Robert enquires What All This Is, about Barbara Blenkinsop? I explain,
and he returns&mdash;very, very briefly&mdash;that old Mrs. Blenkinsop ought to be
Shot&mdash;which gets us no further, but meets with my entire approval.</p>
<p><i>April 10th.</i>&mdash;Entire parish now seething with the <i>affaire</i>
Blenkinsop. Old Mrs. B. falls ill, and retires to bed. Barbara bicycles madly
up and down between her mother and the garden of the <i>Cross and Keys</i>,
where C. C. spends much time reading copies of <i>The Times of India</i> and
smoking small cigars. We are all asked by Barbara What she Ought to Do, and all
give different advice. Deadlock appears to have been reached, when C. C.
suddenly announces that he is summoned to London and must have an answer One
Way or the Other immediately.</p>
<p>Old Mrs. B.&mdash;who has been getting better and taking Port&mdash;instantly gets
worse again and says that she will not long stand in the way of dear Barbara's
happiness.</p>
<p>Period of fearful stress sets in, and Barbara and C. C. say Good-bye in the
front sitting-room of the <i>Cross and Keys</i>. They have, says Barbara in
tears, parted For Ever, and Life is Over, and will I take the Guides' Meeting
for her to-night&mdash;which I agree to do.</p>
<p><i>April 12th.</i>&mdash;Return of Robin for the holidays. He has a cold, and, as
usual, is short of handkerchiefs. I write to the Matron about this, but have no
slightest hope of receiving either handkerchiefs or rational explanation of
their disappearance. Robin mentions that he has invited "a boy" to come and
stay for a week. I ask, Is he very nice and a great friend of yours? Oh no,
says Robin, he is one of the most unpopular boys in the school. And after a
moment he adds, <i>That's why</i>. Am touched, and think that this denotes a
generous spirit, but am also undeniably rather apprehensive as to possible
characteristics of future guest. I repeat the story to Mademoiselle, who&mdash;as
usual, when I praise Robin&mdash;at once remarks: "Madame, notre petite Vicky n'a
pas de d&eacute;fauts"&mdash;which is neither true nor relevant.</p>
<p>Receive a letter from Mary K. with postscript: Is it true that Barbara
Blenkinsop is engaged to be married? and am also asked the same question by
Lady B., who looks in on her way to some ducal function on the other side of
the county. Have no time in which to enjoy being in the superior position of
bestowing information, as Lady B. at once adds that <i>she</i> always advises
girls to marry, no matter what the man is like, as any husband is better than
none, and there are not nearly enough to go round.</p>
<p>I immediately refer to Rose's collection of distinguished Feminists, giving
her to understand that I know them all well and intimately, and have frequently
discussed the subject with them. Lady B. waves her hand&mdash;(in elegant white kid,
new, not cleaned)&mdash;and declares That may be all very well, but if they could
have got <i>husbands</i> they wouldn't <i>be</i> Feminists. I instantly assert
that all have had husbands, and some two or three. This may or may not be true,
but have seldom known stronger homicidal impulse. Final straw is added when
Lady B. amiably observes that <i>I</i>, at least, have nothing to complain of,
as she always thinks Robert such a safe, respectable husband for <i>any</i>
woman. Give her briefly to understand that Robert is in reality a compound of
Don Juan, the Marquis de Sade, and Dr. Crippen, but that we do not care to let
it be known locally. Cannot say whether she is or is not impressed by this, as
she declares herself obliged to go, because ducal function "cannot begin
without her". All I can think of is to retort that Duchesses&mdash;(of whom, in
actual fact, I do not know any)&mdash;always remind me of Alice in Wonderland, as do
white kid gloves of the White Rabbit. Lady B. replies that I am always so
well-read, and car moves off leaving her with, as usual, the last word.</p>
<p>Evolve in my own mind merry fantasy in which members of the Royal Family
visit the neighbourhood and honour Robert and myself by becoming our guests at
luncheon. (Cannot quite fit Howard Fitzs. into this scheme, but gloss over that
aspect of the case.) Robert has just been raised to the peerage, and I am, with
a slight and gracious inclination of the head, taking precedence of Lady B. at
large dinner party, when Vicky comes in to say that the Scissor-Grinder is at
the door, and if we haven't anything to grind, he'll be pleased to attend to
the clocks or rivet any china.</p>
<p>Am disconcerted at finding itinerant gipsy, of particularly low appearance,
encamped at back door, with collection of domestic articles strewn all round
him and his machine. Still more disconcerted at appearance of Mademoiselle, in
fits of loud and regrettable Gallic merriment, bearing extremely unsuitable
fragments of bedroom ware in either hand...She, Vicky, and the Scissor-Grinder
join in unseemly mirth, and I leave them to it, thankful that at least Lady B.
is by now well on her way and cannot descend upon the scene. Am seriously
exercised in my mind as to probable standard of humour with which Vicky will
grow up.</p>
<p>Look for Robin and eventually find him with the cat, shut up into totally
unventilated linen-cupboard, eating cheese which he says he found on the back
stairs.</p>
<p>(Undoubtedly, a certain irony can be found in the fact that I have recently
been appointed to new Guardians Committee, and am expected to visit Workhouse,
etc., with particular reference to children's quarters, in order that I may
offer valuable suggestions on questions of hygiene and general welfare of
inmates...Can only hope that fellow-members of the Committee will never be
inspired to submit my own domestic arrangements to similar inspection.)</p>
<p>Write letters. Much interrupted by Helen Wills, wanting to be let out,
kitten, wanting to be let in, and dear Robin, who climbs all over all the
furniture, apparently unconscious that he is doing so, and tells me at the same
time, loudly and in full, the story of <i>The Swiss Family Robinson</i>.</p>
<p><i>April 14th.</i>&mdash;Cook electrifies me by asking me if I have heard that
Miss Barbara Blenkinsop's engagement is on again, it's all over the village.
The gentleman, she says, came down by the 8.45 last night, and is at the
<i>Cross and Keys</i>. As it is exactly 9.15 A.M. when she tells me this, I ask
how she knows? Cook merely repeats that It is All Over the Village, and that
Miss Barbara will quite as like as not be married by special licence, and old
Mrs. B. is in such a way as never was. Am disconcerted to find that Cook and I
have been talking our heads off for the better part of forty minutes before I
remember that gossip is both undignified and undesirable.</p>
<p>Just as I am putting on my hat to go down to the Blenkinsops' our Vicar's
wife rushes in. All is true, she says, <i>and more</i>. Crosbie Carruthers, in
altogether desperate state, has threatened suicide, and written terrific
farewell letter to Barbara, who has cried herself&mdash;as our Vicar's wife rather
strangely expresses it&mdash;to the merest <i>pulp</i>, and begged him to Come At
Once. A Blenkinsop Family Council has been summoned&mdash;old Mrs. B. has had
Attacks&mdash;(nobody quite knows what of)&mdash;but has finally been persuaded to
reconsider entire problem. Our Vicar has been called in to give impartial
advice and consolation to all parties. He is there now. Surely, I urge, he will
use all his influence on behalf of C. C. and Barbara? Our Vicar's wife,
agitated, says Yes, Yes,&mdash;he is all in favour of young folk living their own
lives, whilst at the same time he feels that a mother's claims are sacred, and
although he realises the full beauty of self-sacrifice, yet on the other hand
no one knows better than he does that the devotion of a Good Man is not to be
lightly relinquished.</p>
<p>Feel that if this is to be our Vicar's only contribution towards the
solution of the problem, he might just as well have stayed at home&mdash;but
naturally do not impart this opinion to his wife. We decide to walk down to the
village, and do so. The gardener stops me on the way, and says he thought I
might like to know that Miss Barbara's young gentleman has turned up again, and
wants to marry her before he sails next month, and old Mrs. Blenkinsop is
taking on so, they think she'll have a stroke.</p>
<p>Similar information also reaches us from six different quarters in the
village. No less than three motor-cars and two bicycles are to be seen outside
old Mrs. B.'s cottage, but no one emerges, and I am obliged to suggest that our
Vicar's wife should come home with me to lunch. This she does, after many
demurs, and gets cottage-pie&mdash;(too much onion)&mdash;rice-shape, and stewed prunes.
Should have sent to the farm for cream, if I had known.</p>

</center>
<p><i>April 15th.</i>&mdash;Old Mrs. Blenkinsop reported to have Come Round. Elderly
unmarried female Blenkinsop, referred to as Cousin Maud, has suddenly
materialised, and offered to live with her&mdash;Our Vicar has come out boldly in
support of this scheme&mdash;and Crosbie Carruthers has given Barbara engagement
ring with three stones, said to be rare Indian Topazes, and has gone up to town
to Make Arrangements. Immediate announcement in the <i>Morning Post</i>
expected.</p>
<p><i>April 18th.</i>&mdash;Receive visit from Barbara, who begs that I will escort
her to London for quiet and immediate wedding. Am obliged to refuse, owing to
bad colds of Robin and Vicky, general instability of domestic staff, and
customary unsatisfactory financial situation. Offer then passed on to our
Vicar's wife, who at once accepts it. I undertake, however, at Barbara's urgent
request, to look in as often as possible on her mother. Will I, adds Barbara,
make it clear that she is not losing a Daughter, but only gaining a Son, and
two years will soon be over, and at the end of that time dear Crosbie will
bring her home to England. I recklessly commit myself to doing anything and
everything, and write to the Army and Navy Stores for a luncheon-basket, to
give as wedding-present to Barbara. The Girl Guides present her with a
sugar-castor and a waste-paper basket embossed with raffia flowers. Lady B.
sends a chafing-dish with a card bearing illegible and far-fetched joke
connected with Indian curries. We all agree that this is not in the least
amusing. Mademoiselle causes Vicky to present Barbara with small tray-cloth, on
which two hearts are worked in cross-stitch.</p>
<p><i>April 19th.</i>&mdash;Both children simultaneously develop incredibly low
complaint known as "pink-eye" that everyone unites in telling me is peculiar to
the more saliently neglected and underfed section of the juvenile population in
the East End of London.</p>
<p>Vicky has a high temperature and is put to bed, while Robin remains on his
feet, but is not allowed out of doors until present cold winds are over. I
leave Vicky to Mademoiselle and <i>Les M&eacute;moires d'un Ane</i> in the
night-nursery, and undertake to amuse Robin downstairs. He says that he has a
Splendid Idea. This turns out to be that I should play the piano, whilst he
simultaneously sets off the gramophone, the musical-box, and the chiming
clock.</p>
<p>I protest.</p>
<p>Robin implores, and says It will be just like an Orchestra. (Shade of Dame
Ethel Smyth, whose Reminiscences I have just been reading!) I weakly yield, and
attack, <i>con spirito</i>, "The Broadway Melody" in the key of C Major. Robin,
in great excitement, starts the clock, puts "Mucking About the Garden" on the
gramophone, and winds up the musical-box, which tinkles out the Waltz from
<i>Floradora</i> in a tinny sort of way, and no recognisable key. Robin springs
about and cheers. I watch him sympathetically and keep down, at his request,
the loud pedal.</p>
<p>The door is flung open by Howard Fitzs., and Lady B. enters, wearing
bran-new green Kasha with squirrel collar, and hat to match, and accompanied by
military-looking friend.</p>
<p>Have no wish to record subsequent few minutes, in which I endeavour to
combine graceful greetings to Lady B. and the military friend, with simple and
yet dignified explanation of singular state of affairs presented to them, and
unobtrusive directions to Robin to switch off musical-box and gramophone and
betake himself and his pink-eye upstairs. Clock has mercifully ceased to chime,
and Robin struggles gallantly with musical-box, but "Mucking About the Garden"
continues to ring brazenly through the room for what seems about an hour and a
half...(Should not have minded quite so much if it had been "Classical
Memories", which I also possess, or even a Layton and Johnstone duet.)</p>
<p>Robin goes upstairs, but not until after Lady B. has closely scrutinised
him, and observed that He looks like Measles, to her. Military friend tactfully
pretends absorption in the nearest bookcase until this is over, when he emerges
with breezy observation concerning <i>Bulldog Drummond</i>.</p>
<p>Lady B. at once informs him that he must not say that kind of thing to
<i>me</i>, as I am so Very Literary. After this, the military friend looks at
me with unconcealed horror, and does not attempt to speak to me again. On the
whole, am much relieved when the call is over.</p>
<p>Go upstairs and see Vicky, who seems worse, and telephone for the doctor.
Mademoiselle begins lugubrious story, which is evidently destined to end
disastrously, about a family in her native town mysteriously afflicted by
Smallpox&mdash;(of which all the preliminary symptoms were identical with those of
Vicky's present disorder)&mdash;afterwards traced to unconsidered purchase by <i>le
papa</i> of Eastern rugs, sold by itinerant vendor on the quay at Marseilles.
Cut her short after the death of the six-months-old baby, as I perceive that
all the other five children are going to follow suit, as slowly and agonisingly
as possible.</p>
<p><i>April 20th.</i>&mdash;Vicky develops unmistakable measles, and doctor says
that Robin may follow suit any day. Infection must have been picked up at Aunt
Gertrude's, and shall write and tell her so.</p>
<p>Extraordinary and nightmare-like state of affairs sets in, and I alternate
between making lemonade for Vicky and telling her the story of <i>Frederick and
the Picnic</i> upstairs, and bathing Robin's pink-eye with boracic lotion and
reading <i>The Coral Island</i> to him downstairs.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle is <i>d&eacute;vou&eacute;e</i> in the extreme, and utterly
refuses to let anyone but herself sleep in Vicky's room, but find it difficult
to understand exactly on what principle it is that she persists in wearing a
<i>peignoir</i> and <i>pantoufles</i> day and night alike. She is also
unwearied in recommending very strange <i>tisanes</i>, which she proposes to
brew herself from herbs&mdash;fortunately unobtainable&mdash;in the garden.</p>
<p>Robert, in this crisis, is less helpful than I could wish, and takes up
characteristically masculine attitude that We are All Making a Great Fuss about
Very Little, and the whole thing has been got up for the express purpose of
putting him to inconvenience&mdash;(which, however, it does not do, as he stays out
all day, and insists on having dinner exactly the same as usual every
evening).</p>
<p>Vicky incredibly and alarmingly good, Robin almost equally so in patches,
but renders himself unpopular with Fitzs. by leaving smears of Plasticine,
pools of paint-water, and even blots of ink on much of the furniture. Find it
very difficult to combine daily close inspection of him, with a view to
discovering the beginning of measles, with light-hearted optimism that I feel
to be right and rational attitude of mind.</p>
<p>Weather very cold and rainy, and none of the fires will burn up. Cannot say
why this is, but it adds considerably to condition of gloom and exhaustion
which I feel to be gaining upon me hourly.</p>
<p><i>April 25th.</i>&mdash;Vicky recovering slowly, Robin showing no signs of
measles. Am myself victim of curious and unpleasant form of chill, no doubt due
to over-fatigue.</p>
<p>Howard Fitzsimmons gives notice, to the relief of everyone, and I obtain
service of superior temporary house-parlourmaid at cost of enormous weekly
sum.</p>
<p><i>April 27th.</i>&mdash;Persistence of chill compels me to retire to bed for
half a day, and Robert suggests gloomily that I have caught the measles. I
demonstrate that this is impossible, and after lunch get up and play cricket
with Robin on the lawn. After tea, keep Vicky company. She insists upon playing
at the Labours of Hercules, and we give energetic representations of
slaughtering the Hydra, cleaning out the Augean Stables, and so on. Am divided
between gratification at Vicky's classical turn of mind and strong
disinclination for so much exertion.</p>
<p><i>May 7th.</i>&mdash;Resume Diary after long and deplorable interlude,
vanquished chill having suddenly reappeared with immense force and fury, and
revealed itself as measles. Robin, on same day, begins to cough, and expensive
hospital nurse materialises and takes complete charge. She proves kind and
efficient, and brings me messages from the children, and realistic drawing from
Robin entitled "Ill person being eaten up by jerms".</p>
<p>(Query: Is dear Robin perhaps future Heath Robinson or Arthur Watts?)</p>
<p>Soon after this all becomes incoherent and muddled. Chief recollection is of
hearing the doctor say that of course my Age is against me, which hurts my
feelings and makes me feel like old Mrs. Blenkinsop. After a few days, however,
I get the better of my age, and am given champagne, grapes, and Valentine's
Meat Juice.</p>
<p>Should like to ask what all this is going to cost, but feel it would be
ungracious.</p>
<p>The children, to my astonishment, are up and about again, and allowed to
come and see me. They play at Panthers on the bed, until removed by Nurse.
Robin reads aloud to me, article on Lord Chesterfield from pages of <i>Time and
Tide</i>, which has struck him because he, like the writer, finds it difficult
to accept a compliment gracefully. What do <i>I</i> do, he enquires, when I
receive so many compliments all at once that I am overwhelmed? Am obliged to
admit that I have not yet found myself in this predicament, at which Robin
looks surprised, and slightly disappointed.</p>
<p>Robert, the nurse, and I decide in conclave that the children shall be sent
to Bude for a fortnight with Nurse, and Mademoiselle given a holiday in which
to recover from her exertions. I am to join the Bude party when doctor
permits.</p>
<p>Robert goes to make this announcement to the nursery, and comes back with
fatal news that Mademoiselle is <i>bless&eacute;e</i>, and that the more he
asks her to explain, the more monosyllabic she becomes. Am not allowed either
to see her or to write explanatory and soothing note and am far from reassured
by Vicky's report that Mademoiselle, bathing her, has wept, and said that in
England there are hearts of stone.</p>
<p><i>May 12th.</i>&mdash;Further interlude, this time owing to trouble with the
eyes. (No doubt concomitant of my Age, once again.) The children and hospital
nurse depart on the 9th, and I am left to gloomy period of total inactivity and
lack of occupation. Get up after a time and prowl about in kind of
semi-ecclesiastical darkness, further intensified by enormous pair of tinted
spectacles. One and only comfort is that I cannot see myself in the glass. Two
days ago, decide to make great effort and come down for tea, but nearly relapse
and go straight back to bed again at sight of colossal demand for the Rates,
confronting me on hall-stand without so much as an envelope between us.</p>
<p>(<i>Mem</i>.: This sort of thing so very unlike picturesque convalescence in
a novel, when heroine is gladdened by sight of spring flowers, sunshine, and
what not. No mention ever made of Rates, or anything like them.)</p>
<p>Miss the children very much and my chief companion is kitchen cat, a
hard-bitten animal with only three and a half legs and a reputation for
catching and eating a nightly average of three rabbits. We get on well together
until I have recourse to the piano, when he invariably yowls and asks to be let
out. On the whole, am obliged to admit that he is probably right, for I have
forgotten all I ever knew, and am reduced to playing popular music by ear,
which I do badly.</p>
<p>Dear Barbara sends me a book of Loopy Limericks, and Robert assures me that
I shall enjoy them later on. Personally, feel doubtful of surviving many more
days of this kind.</p>
<p><i>May 13th.</i>&mdash;Regrettable, but undeniable ray of amusement lightens
general murk on hearing report, through Robert, that Cousin Maud Blenkinsop
possesses a baby Austin, and has been seen running it all round the parish with
old Mrs. B., shawls and all, beside her. (It is many years since Mrs. B. gave
us all to understand that if she so much as walked across the room unaided, she
would certainly fall down dead.)</p>
<p>Cousin Maud, adds Robert thoughtfully, is not <i>his</i> idea of a good
driver. He says no more, but I at once have dramatic visions of old Mrs. B.
flying over the nearest hedge, shawls waving in every direction, while Cousin
Maud and the baby Austin charge a steam-roller in a narrow lane. Am sorry to
record that this leads to hearty laughter on my part, after which I feel better
than for weeks past.</p>
<p>The doctor comes to see me, says that he <i>thinks</i> my eyelashes will
grow again&mdash;(should have preferred something much more emphatic, but am too
much afraid of further reference to my age to insist)&mdash;and agrees to my joining
children at Bude next week. He also, reluctantly, and with an air of suspicion,
says that I may use my eyes for an hour every day, unless pain ensues.</p>
<p><i>May 15th.</i>&mdash;Our Vicar's wife, hearing that I am no longer in
quarantine, comes to enliven me. Greet her with an enthusiasm to which she
must, I fear, be unaccustomed, as it appears to startle her. Endeavour to
explain it (perhaps a little tactlessly) by saying that I have been alone so
long...Robert out all day...children at Bude...and end up with quotation to the
effect that I never hear the sweet music of speech, and start at the sound of
my own. Can see by the way our Vicar's wife receives this that she does not
recognise it as a quotation, and believes the measles to have affected my
brain. (Query: Perhaps she is right?) More normal atmosphere established by a
plea from our Vicar's wife that kitchen cat may be put out of the room. It is,
she knows, very foolish of her, but the presence of a cat makes her feel faint.
Her grandmother was exactly the same. Put a cat into the same room as her
grandmother, hidden under the sofa if you liked, and in two minutes the
grandmother would say: "I believe there's a cat in this room," and at once turn
queer. I hastily put kitchen cat out of the window, and we agree that heredity
is very odd.</p>
<p>And now, says our Vicar's wife, how am I? Before I can reply, she does so
for me, and says that she knows just how I feel. Weak as a rat, legs like
cotton-wool, no spine whatever, and head like a boiled owl. Am depressed by
this diagnosis, and begin to feel that it must be correct. However, she adds,
all will be different after a blow in the wind at Bude, and meanwhile, she must
tell me all the news.</p>
<p>She does so.</p>
<p>Incredible number of births, marriages, and deaths appear to have taken
place in the parish in the last four weeks; also Mrs. W. has dismissed her cook
and cannot get another one, our Vicar has written a letter about Drains to the
local paper and it has been put in, and Lady B. has been seen in a new car. To
this our Vicar's wife adds rhetorically: Why not an aeroplane, she would like
to know? (Why not, indeed?)</p>
<p>Finally a Committee Meeting has been held&mdash;at which, she interpolates
hastily I was much missed&mdash;and a Garden F&ecirc;te arranged, in aid of funds
for Village Hall. It would be so nice, she adds optimistically, if the
F&ecirc;te could be held <i>here</i>. I agree that it would, and stifle a
misgiving that Robert may not agree. In any case, he knows, and I know, and our
Vicar's wife knows, that F&Atilde;&ordf;te will have to take place here, as there isn't
anywhere else.</p>
<p>Tea is brought in&mdash;superior temporary's afternoon out, and Cook has, as
usual, carried out favourite labour-saving device of three sponge-cakes and one
bun jostling one another on the same plate&mdash;and we talk about Barbara and
Crosbie Carruthers, beekeeping, modern youth, and difficulty of removing
oil-stains from carpets. Have I, asks our Vicar's wife, read <i>A Brass Hat in
No Man's Land</i>? No, I have not. Then, she says, <i>don't</i>, on any
account. There are so many sad and shocking things in life as it <i>is</i>,
that writers should confine themselves to the bright, the happy, and the
beautiful. This the author of <i>A Brass Hat</i> has entirely failed to do. It
subsequently turns out that our Vicar's wife has not read the book herself, but
that our Vicar has skimmed it, and declared it to be very painful and
unnecessary. (<i>Mem</i>.: Put <i>Brass Hat</i> down for <i>Times</i> Book Club
list, if not already there.)</p>
<p>Our Vicar's wife suddenly discovers that it is six o'clock, exclaims that
she is shocked, and attempts <i>fausse sortie</i>, only to return with urgent
recommendation to me to try Valentine's Meat Juice, which once practically,
under Providence, saved our Vicar's uncle's life. Story of the uncle's illness,
convalescence, recovery, and subsequent death at the age of eighty-one,
follows. Am unable to resist telling her, in return, about wonderful effect of
Bemax on Mary Kell-way's youngest, and this leads&mdash;curiously enough&mdash;to the
novels of Anthony Trollope, death of the Begum of Bhopal, and scenery in the
Lake Country.</p>
<p>At twenty minutes to seven, our Vicar's wife is again shocked, and rushes
out of the house. She meets Robert on the doorstep and stops to tell him that I
am as thin as a rake, and a very bad colour, and the eyes, after measles, often
give rise to serious trouble. Robert, so far as I can hear, makes no answer to
any of it, and our Vicar's wife finally departs.</p>
<p>(Query here suggests itself: Is not silence frequently more efficacious than
the utmost eloquence? Answer probably yes. Must try to remember this more often
than I do.)</p>
<p>Second post brings a long letter from Mademoiselle, recuperating with
friends at Clacton-on-Sea, written, apparently, with a pin point dipped in
violet ink on thinnest imaginable paper, and crossed in every direction.
Decipher portions of it with great difficulty, but am relieved to find that I
am still "Bien-ch&egrave;re Madame" and that recent mysterious affront has been
condoned.</p>
<p>(<i>Mem</i>.: If Cook sends up jelly even once again, as being suitable diet
for convalescence, shall send it straight back to the kitchen.)</p>
<p><i>May 16th.</i>&mdash;But for disappointing children, should be much tempted to
abandon scheme for my complete restoration to health at Bude. Weather icy cold,
self feeble and more than inclined to feverishness, and Mademoiselle, who was
to have come with me, and helped with children, now writes that she is
<i>d&eacute;sol&eacute;e</i>, but has developed <i>une angine</i>. Do not know
what this is, and have alarming thoughts about Angina Pectoris, but dictionary
reassures me. I say to Robert: "After all, shouldn't I get well just as quickly
at home?" He replies briefly: "Better go," and I perceive that his mind is made
up. After a moment he suggests&mdash;but without real conviction&mdash;that I might like
to invite our Vicar's wife to come with me. I reply with a look only, and
suggestion falls to the ground.</p>
<p>A letter from Lady B. saying that she has only just heard about
measles&mdash;(Why only just, when news has been all over parish for weeks?) and is
so sorry, especially as measles are no joke at my age&mdash;(Can she be in league
with Doctor, who also used identical objectionable expression?).&mdash;She cannot
come herself to enquire, as with so many visitors always coming and going it
wouldn't be wise, but if I want anything from the House, I am to telephone
without hesitation. She has given "her people" orders that anything I ask for
is to be sent up. Have a very good mind to telephone and ask for a pound of tea
and Lady B.'s pearl necklace&mdash;(Could Cleopatra be quoted as precedent
here?)&mdash;and see what happens.</p>
<p>Further demand for the Rates arrives, and Cook sends up jelly once more for
lunch. I offer it to Helen Wills, who gives one heave, and turns away. Feel
that this would more than justify me in sending down entire dish untouched, but
Cook will certainly give notice if I do, and cannot face possibility.
Interesting to note that although by this time all Cook's jellies take away at
sight what appetite measles have left me, am more wholly revolted by emerald
green variety than by yellow or red. Should like to work out possible Freudian
significance of this, but find myself unable to concentrate.</p>
<p>Go to sleep in the afternoon, and awake sufficiently restored to do what I
have long contemplated and Go Through my clothes. Result so depressing that I
wish I had never done it. Have nothing fit to wear, and if I had, should look
like a scarecrow in it at present. Send off parcel with knitted red cardigan,
two evening dresses (much too short for present mode), three out-of-date hats,
and tweed skirt that bags at the knees, to Mary Kellway's Jumble Sale, where
she declares that <i>anything</i> will be welcome. Make out a list of all the
new clothes I require, get pleasantly excited about them, am again confronted
with the Rates, and put the list in the fire.</p>
<p><i>May 17th.</i>&mdash;Robert drives me to North Road station to catch train for
Bude. Temperature has fallen again, and I ask Robert if it is below zero. He
replies briefly and untruthfully that the day will get warmer as it goes on,
and no doubt Bude will be one blaze of sunshine. We arrive early and sit on a
bench on the platform next to a young woman with a cough, who takes one look at
me and then says: "Dreadful, isn't it?" Cannot help feeling that she has
summarised the whole situation quite admirably. Robert hands me my ticket&mdash;he
has handsomely offered to make it first-class and I have refused&mdash;and gazes at
me with rather strange expression. At last he says: "You don't think you're
going there to <i>die</i>, do you?" Now that he suggests it, realise that I
<i>do</i> feel very like that, but summon up smile that I feel to be
unconvincing and make sprightly reference to Bishop, whose name I forget,
coming to lay his bones at place the name of which I cannot remember. All of it
appears to be Greek to Robert, and I leave him still trying to unravel it.
Journey ensues and proves chilly and exhausting. Rain lashes at the windows,
and every time carriage door opens&mdash;which is often&mdash;gust of icy wind,
mysteriously blowing in two opposite directions at once, goes up my legs and
down back of my neck. Have not told children by what train I am arriving, so no
one meets me, not even bus on which I had counted. Am, however, secretly
thankful, as this gives me an excuse for taking a taxi. Reach lodgings at
rather uninspiring hour of 2.45, too early for tea or bed, which constitute
present summit of my ambitions. Uproarious welcome from children, both in
blooming health and riotous spirits, makes up for everything.</p>
<p><i>May 19th.</i>&mdash;Recovery definitely in sight, although almost certainly
retarded by landlady's inspiration of sending up a nice jelly for supper on
evening of arrival. Rooms reasonably comfortable&mdash;(except for extreme cold,
which is, says landlady, quite unheard-of at this or any other time of
year)&mdash;all is linoleum, pink and gold china, and enlarged photographs of
females in lace collars and males with long moustaches and bow ties. Robin,
Vicky, and the hospital nurse&mdash;retained at vast expense as a temporary
substitute for Mademoiselle&mdash;have apparently braved the weather and spent much
time on the Breakwater. Vicky has also made friends with a little dog, whose
name she alleges to be "Baby", a gentleman who sells papers, another gentleman
who drives about in a Sunbeam, and the head waiter from the Hotel. I tell her
about Mademoiselle's illness, and after a silence she says "Oh!" in tones of
brassy indifference, and resumes topic of little dog "Baby". Robin, from whom I
cannot help hoping better things, makes no comment except "Is she?" and
immediately adds a request for a banana.</p>
<p>(<i>Mem</i>.: Would it not be possible to write more domesticated and less
foreign version of <i>High Wind in Jamaica</i>, featuring extraordinary
callousness of infancy?) Can distinctly recollect heated correspondence in
<i>Time and Tide</i> regarding <i>vraisemblance</i> or otherwise of Jamaica
children, and now range myself, decidedly and for ever, on the side of the
author. Can quite believe that dear Vicky would murder any number of sailors,
if necessary.</p>
<p><i>May 23rd.</i>&mdash;Sudden warm afternoon, children take off their shoes and
dash into pools, landlady says that it's often like this On the <i>last</i>
day of a visit to the sea, she's noticed, and I take brisk walk over the
cliffs, wearing thick tweed coat, and really begin to feel quite warm at the
end of an hour. Pack suit-case after children are in bed, register resolution
never to let stewed prunes and custard form part of any meal ever again as long
as I live, and thankfully write postcard to Robert, announcing time of our
arrival at home to-morrow.</p>
<p><i>May 28th.</i>&mdash;Mademoiselle returns, and is greeted with enthusiasm&mdash;to
my great relief. (Robin and Vicky perhaps less like Jamaica children than I
had feared.) She has on new black and white check skirt, white blouse with
frills, black kid gloves, embroidered in white on the backs, and black straw
hat almost entirely covered in purple violets, and informs me that the whole
outfit was made by herself at a total cost of one pound, nine shillings, and
fourpence-halfpenny. The French undoubtedly thrifty, and gifted in using a
needle, but cannot altogether stifle conviction that a shade less economy might
have produced better results.</p>
<p>She presents me, in the kindest way, with a present in the shape of two blue
glass flower-vases, of spiral construction, and adorned with gilt knobs at many
unexpected points. Vicky receives a large artificial-silk red rose, which she
fortunately appears to admire, and Robin a small affair in wire that is
intended, says Mademoiselle, to extract the stones out of cherries.</p>
<p>(<i>Mem</i>.: Interesting to ascertain number of these ingenious
contrivances sold in a year.)</p>
<p>Am privately rather overcome by Mademoiselle's generosity, and wish that we
could reach the level of the French in what they themselves describe as
<i>petits soins</i>. Place the glass vases in conspicuous position on
dining-room mantelpiece, and am fortunately just in time to stem comment which
I see rising to Robert's lips when he sits down to midday meal and perceives
them.</p>
<p>After lunch, Robin is motored back to school by his father, and I examine
Vicky's summer wardrobe with Mademoiselle, and find that she has outgrown
everything she has in the world.</p>
<p><i>May 30th.</i>&mdash;Arrival of <i>Time and Tide</i>, find that I have been
awarded half of second prize for charming little effort that in my opinion
deserves better. Robert's attempt receives an honourable mention. Recognise
pseudonym of first-prize winner as being that adopted by Mary Kellway. Should
like to think that generous satisfaction envelops me, at dear friend's success,
but am not sure. This week's competition announces itself as a
Triolet&mdash;literary form that I cannot endure, and rules of which I am totally
unable to master.</p>
<p>Receive telephone invitation to lunch with the Frobishers on Sunday. I
accept, less because I want to see them than because a change from domestic
roast beef and gooseberry-tart always pleasant; moreover, absence makes work
lighter for the servants. (<i>Mem</i>.: Candid and intelligent self-examination
as to motive, etc., often leads to very distressing revelations.)</p>
<p>Constrained by conscience, and recollection of promise to Barbara, to go and
call on old Mrs. Blenkinsop. Receive many kind enquiries in village as to my
complete recovery from measles, but observe singular tendency on part of
everybody else to treat this very serious affliction as a joke.</p>
<p>Find old Mrs. B.'s cottage in unheard-of condition of hygienic ventilation,
no doubt attributable to Cousin Maud. Windows all wide open, and casement
curtains flapping in every direction, very cold east wind more than noticeable.
Mrs. B.&mdash;(surely fewer shawls than formerly?)&mdash;sitting quite close to open
window, and not far from equally open door, seems to have turned curious shade
of pale-blue, and shows tendency to shiver. Room smells strongly of furniture
polish and black-lead. Fireplace, indeed, exhibits recent handsome application
of the latter, and has evidently not held fire for days past. Old Mrs. B. more
silent than of old, and makes no reference to silver linings and the like. (Can
spirit of optimism have been blown away by living in continual severe draught?)
Cousin Maud comes in almost immediately. Have met her once before, and say so,
but she makes it clear that this encounter left no impression, and has entirely
escaped her memory. Am convinced that Cousin Maud is one of those people who
pride themselves on always speaking the truth. She is wearing brick-red
sweater&mdash;feel sure she knitted it herself&mdash;tweed skirt, longer at the back than
in front&mdash;and large row of pearl beads. Has very hearty and emphatic manner,
and uses many slang expressions.</p>
<p>I ask for news of Barbara, and Mrs. B.&mdash;(voice a mere bleat, by comparison
with Cousin Maud's)&mdash;says that the dear child will be coming down once more
before she sails, and that continued partings are the lot of the Aged, and to
be expected. I begin to hope that she is approaching her old form, but all is
stopped by Cousin Maud, who shouts out that we're not to talk Rot, and it's a
jolly good thing Barbara has got Off the Hooks at last, poor old girl. We
then talk about golf handicaps, Roedean&mdash;Cousin Maud's dear old
school&mdash;and the baby Austin. More accurate statement would perhaps be that
Cousin Maud talks, and we listen. No sign of <i>Life of Disraeli</i>, or any
other literary activities, such as old Mrs. B. used to be surrounded by, and do
not like to enquire what she now does with her time. Disquieting suspicion that
this is probably settled for her, without reference to her wishes.</p>
<p>Take my leave feeling depressed. Old Mrs. B. rolls her eyes at me as I say
goodbye, and mutters something about not being here much longer, but this is
drowned by hearty laughter from Cousin Maud, who declares that she is Nothing
but an Old Humbug and will See Us All Out.</p>
<p>Am escorted to the front gate by Cousin Maud, who tells me what a topping
thing it is for old Mrs. B. to be taken out of herself a bit, and asks if it
isn't good to be Alive on a bracing day like this? Should like to reply that it
would be far better for some of us to be dead, in my opinion, but spirit for
this repartee fails me, and I weakly reply that I know what she means. I go
away before she has time to slap me on the back, which I feel certain will be
the next thing.</p>
<p>Had had in mind amiable scheme for writing to Barbara to-night to tell her
that old Mrs. B. is quite wonderful, and showing no signs of depression, but
this cannot now be done, and after much thought, do not write at all, but
instead spend the evening trying to reconcile grave discrepancy between
account-book, counterfoils of cheque-book, and rather unsympathetically worded
communication from the Bank.</p>
<p><i>June 1st.</i>&mdash;Sunday lunch with the Frobishers, and four guests staying
in the house with them&mdash;introduced as, apparently, Colonel and Mrs.
Brightpie&mdash;(which seems impossible)&mdash;Sir William Reddieor Ready, or Reddy, or
perhaps even Reddeigh&mdash;and My sister Violet. Latter quite astonishingly pretty,
and wearing admirable flowered tussore that I, as usual, mentally try upon
myself, only to realise that it would undoubtedly suggest melancholy saying
concerning mutton dressed as lamb.</p>
<p>The Colonel sits next to me at lunch, and we talk about fishing, which I
have never attempted, and look upon as cruelty to animals, but this, with
undoubted hypocrisy and moral cowardice, I conceal. Robert has My sister
Violet, and I hear him at intervals telling her about the pigs, which seems
odd, but she looks pleased, so perhaps is interested.</p>
<p>Conversation suddenly becomes general, as topic of present-day Dentistry is
introduced by Lady F. We all, except Robert, who eats bread, have much to
say.</p>
<p>(<i>Mem</i>.: Remember to direct conversation into similar channel, when
customary periodical deathly silence descends upon guests at my own table.)</p>
<p>Weather is wet and cold, and had confidently hoped to escape tour of the
garden, but this is not to be, and directly lunch is over we rush out into the
damp. Boughs drip on to our heads and water squelches beneath our feet, but
rhododendrons and lupins undoubtedly very magnificent, and references to Ruth
Draper not more numerous than usual. I find myself walking with Mrs. Brightpie
(?), who evidently knows all that can be known about a garden. Fortunately she
is prepared to originate all the comments herself, and I need only say, "Yes,
isn't that an attractive variety?" and so on. She enquires once if I have
<i>ever</i> succeeded in making the dear blue Grandiflora Magnifica
Superbiensis&mdash;(or something like that)&mdash;feel really happy and at home in this
climate? to which I am able to reply with absolute truth by a simple negative,
at which I fancy she looks rather relieved. Is her own life perhaps one long
struggle to acclimatise the G. M. S.? and what would she have replied if I had
said that, in <i>my</i> garden, the dear thing grew like a weed?</p>
<p>(<i>Mem</i>.: Must beware of growing tendency to indulge in similar idle
speculations, which lead nowhere, and probably often give me the appearance of
being absentminded in the society of my fellow-creatures.)</p>
<p>After prolonged inspection, we retrace steps, and this time find myself with
Sir William R. and Lady F. talking about grass. Realise with horror that we are
now making our way towards the <i>stables</i>. Nothing whatever to be done
about it, except keep as far away from the horses as possible, and refrain from
any comment whatever, in hopes of concealing that I know nothing about horses
except that they frighten me. Robert, I notice, looks sorry for me, and places
himself between me and terrifying-looking animal that glares out at me from
loose-box and curls up its lip. Feel grateful to him, and eventually leave
stables with shattered nerves and soaking wet shoes. Exchange customary
graceful farewells with host and hostess, saying how much I have enjoyed
coming.</p>
<p>(Query here suggests itself, as often before: Is it utterly impossible to
combine the amenities of civilisation with even the minimum of honesty required
to satisfy the voice of conscience? Answer still in abeyance at present.)</p>
<p>Robert goes to Evening Service, and I play Halma with Vicky. She says that
she wants to go to school, and produces string of excellent reasons why she
should do so. I say that I will think it over, but am aware, by previous
experience, that Vicky has almost miraculous aptitude for getting her own way,
and will probably succeed in this instance as in others.</p>
<p>Rather depressing Sunday supper&mdash;cold beef, baked potatoes, salad, and
depleted cold tart&mdash;after which I write to Rose, the Cleaners, the Army and
Navy Stores, and the County Secretary of the Women's Institute, and Robert goes
to sleep over the <i>Sunday Pictorial</i>.</p>
<p><i>June 3rd.</i>&mdash;Astounding and enchanting change in the weather, which
becomes warm. I carry chair, writing-materials, rug, and cushion into the
garden, but am called in to have a look at the Pantry Sink, please, as it seems
to have blocked itself up. Attempted return to garden frustrated by arrival of
note from the village concerning Garden F&Atilde;&ordf;te arrangements, which requires
immediate answer, necessity for speaking to the butcher on the telephone, and
sudden realisation that Laundry List hasn't yet been made out, and the Van will
be here at eleven. When it does come, I have to speak about the tablecloths,
which leads&mdash;do not know how&mdash;to long conversation about the Derby, the Van
speaking highly of an outsider&mdash;<i>Trews</i>&mdash;whilst I uphold the chances of
<i>Silver Flare</i>&mdash;(mainly because I like the name).</p>
<p>Shortly after this, Mrs. S. arrives from the village, to collect jumble for
Garden F&ecirc;te, which takes time. After lunch, sky clouds over, and
Mademoiselle and Vicky kindly help me to carry chair, writing-materials, rug,
and cushion into the house again.</p>
<p>Robert receives letter by second post announcing death of his godfather,
aged ninety-seven, and decides to go to the funeral on 5th June.</p>
<p>(<i>Mem</i>.: Curious, but authenticated fact, that a funeral is the only
gathering to which the majority of men ever go willingly. Should like to think
out why this should be so, but must instead unearth top-hat and other
accoutrements of woe and try if open air will remove smell of naphthaline.)</p>
<p><i>June 7th.</i>&mdash;Receive letter&mdash;(Why, in Heaven's name, not
telegram?)&mdash;from Robert, to announce that godfather has left him Five Hundred
Pounds. This strikes me as so utterly incredible and magnificent that I shed
tears of pure relief and satisfaction. Mademoiselle comes in, in the midst of
them, and on receiving explanation kisses me on both cheeks and exclaims: "Ah,
je m'en doutais! Voil&Atilde;&nbsp; bien ce bon Saint Antoine!" Can only draw
conclusion that she has, most touchingly, been petitioning Heaven on our
behalf, and very nearly weep again at the thought. Spend joyful evening making
out lists of bills to be paid, jewellery to be redeemed, friends to be
benefited, and purchases to be made, out of legacy, and am only slightly
disconcerted on finding that net total of lists, when added together, comes to
exactly one thousand three hundred and twenty pounds.</p>
<p><i>June 9th.</i>&mdash;Return, yesterday, of Robert, and have every reason to
believe that, though neither talkative nor exuberant, he fully appreciates
newly achieved stability of financial position. He warmly concurs in my
suggestion that great-aunt's diamond ring should be retrieved from Plymouth
pawnbroker's in time to figure at our next excitement, which is the Garden
F&Atilde;&ordf;te, and I accordingly hasten to Plymouth by earliest available bus.</p>
<p>Not only do I return with ring&mdash;(pawnbroker, after a glance at the calendar,
congratulates me on being just in time)&mdash;but have also purchased new hat for
myself, many yards of material for Vicky's frocks, a Hornby train for Robin,
several gramophone records, and a small mauve bag for Mademoiselle. All give
the utmost satisfaction, and I furthermore arrange to have hot lobster and
fruit salad for dinner&mdash;these, however, not a great success with Robert,
unfortunately, and he suggests&mdash;though kindly&mdash;that I was perhaps thinking more
of my own tastes than of his, when devising this form of celebration. Must
regretfully acknowledge truth in this. Discussion of godfather's legacy fills
the evening happily, and I say that we ought to give a Party, and suggest
combining it with Garden F&Atilde;&ordf;te. Robert replies, however,&mdash;and on further
reflection find that I agree with him&mdash;that this would not conduce to the
success of either entertainment, and scheme is abandoned. He also begs me to
get Garden F&ecirc;te over before I begin to think of anything else, and I
agree to do so.</p>
<p><i>June 12th.</i>&mdash;Nothing is spoken of but weather, at the moment
propitious&mdash;but who can say whether similar conditions will prevail on
17th?&mdash;relative merits of having the Tea laid under the oak trees or near the
tennis-court, outside price that can be reasonably asked for articles on Jumble
Stall, desirability of having Ice-cream combined with Lemonade Stall, and the
like. Date fortunately coincides with Robin's half-term, and I feel that he
must and shall come home for the occasion. Expense, as I point out to Robert,
now nothing to us. He yields. I become reckless, have thoughts of a
House-party, and invite Rose to come down from London. She accepts.</p>
<p>Dear old school-friend Cissie Crabbe, by strange coincidence, writes that
she will be on her way to Land's End on 16th June; may she stay for two nights?
Yes, she may. Robert does not seem pleased when I explain that he will have to
vacate his dressing-room for Cissie Crabbe, as Rose will be occupying spare
bedroom, and Robin at home. This will complete House-party.</p>
<p><i>June 17th.</i>&mdash;Entire household rises practically at dawn, in order to
take part in active preparations for Garden F&Atilde;&ordf;te. Mademoiselle reported to have
refused breakfast in order to put final stitches in embroidered pink satin
boot-bag for Fancy Stall, which she has, to my certain knowledge, been working
at for the past six weeks. At ten o'clock our Vicar's wife dashes in to ask
what I think of the weather, and to say that she cannot stop a moment. At
eleven she is still here, and has been joined by several stall-holders, and
tiresome local couple called White, who want to know if there will be a Tennis
Tournament, and if not, is there not still time to organise one? I reply curtly
in the negative to both suggestions and they depart, looking huffed. Our
Vicar's wife says that this may have lost us their patronage at the F&Atilde;&ordf;te
altogether, and that Mrs. White's mother, who is staying with them, is said to
be rich, and might easily have been worth a couple of pounds to us.</p>
<p>Diversion fortunately occasioned by unexpected arrival of solid and
respectable-looking claret-coloured motor-car, from which Barbara and Crosbie
Carruthers emerge. Barbara is excited; C. C. remains calm but looks benevolent.
Our Vicar's wife screams, and throws a pair of scissors wildly into the air.
(They are eventually found in Bran Tub containing Twopenny Dips, and are the
cause of much trouble, as small child who fishes them out maintains them to be
<i>bona fide</i> dip and refuses to give them up.)</p>
<p>Barbara looks blooming, and says how wonderful it is to see the dear old
place quite unchanged. Cannot whole-heartedly agree with this, as it is not
three months since she was here last, but fortunately she requires no answer,
and says that she and C. C. are looking up old friends and will return for the
Opening of the F&Atilde;&ordf;te this afternoon.</p>
<p>Robert goes to meet old school-friend Cissie Crabbe at station, and Rose and
I to help price garments at Jumble Stall. (Find that my views are not always
similar to those of other members of Committee. Why, for instance, only
three-and-sixpence for grey georgette only sacrificed reluctantly at eleventh
hour from my wardrobe?)</p>
<p>Arrival of Cissie Crabbe (wearing curious wool hat which I at once feel
would look better on Jumble Stall) is followed by cold lunch. Have made special
point of remembering nuts and banana sandwiches for Cissie, but have difficulty
in preventing Robin and Vicky&mdash;to whom I have omitted to give
explanation&mdash;making it obvious that they would prefer this diet to cold lamb
and salad. Just as tinned pineapple and junket stage is passed, Robin informs
me that there are people beginning to arrive, and we all disperse in desperate
haste and excitement, to reappear in best clothes. I wear red foulard and new
red hat, but find&mdash;as usual&mdash;that every petticoat I have in the world is either
rather too long or much too short. Mademoiselle comes to the rescue and puts
safety-pins in shoulder-straps, one of which becomes unfastened later and
causes me great suffering. Rose, also as usual, looks nicer than anybody else
in delightful green delaine. Cissie Crabbe also has reasonably attractive
dress, but detracts from effect with numerous scarab rings, cameo brooches,
tulle scarves, enamel buckles, and barbaric necklaces. Moreover, she clings (I
think mistakenly) to little wool hat, which looks odd. Robin and Vicky both
present enchanting appearance, although Mary's three little Kellways, all alike
in pale rose tussore, undeniably decorative. (Natural wave in hair of all
three, which seems to me unjust, but nothing can be done until Vicky reaches
age suitable for Permanent Waving.)</p>

"0800661h-images/0800661h-14.jpg"></p>
</center>
<p>Lady Frobisher arrives&mdash;ten minutes too early&mdash;to open F&Atilde;&ordf;te, and is walked
about by Robert until our Vicar says, Well, he thinks perhaps that we are now
all gathered together...(Have profane impulse to add "<i>In the sight of
God</i>", but naturally stifle it.) Lady F. is poised gracefully on little bank
under the chestnut tree, our Vicar beside her, Robert and myself modestly
retiring a few paces behind, our Vicar's wife kindly, but mistakenly, trying to
induce various unsuitable people to mount bank&mdash;which she humorously refers to
as the Platform&mdash;when all is thrown into confusion by sensational arrival of
colossal Bentley containing Lady B.&mdash;in sapphire-blue and pearls&mdash;with escort
of fashionable creatures, male and female, apparently dressed for Ascot.</p>
<center>
<p><a name="0800661h-15" id="0800661h-15"></a><img alt="" src=
"0800661h-images/0800661h-15.jpg"></p>
</center>
<p>"Go on, go on!" says Lady B., waving hand in white kid glove, and dropping
small jewelled bag, lace parasol, and embroidered handkerchief as she does so.
Great confusion while these articles are picked up and restored, but at last we
do go on, and Lady F. says what a pleasure it is to her to be here to-day, what
a desirable asset a Village Hall is, and much else to the same effect. Our
Vicar thanks her for coming here to-day&mdash;so many claims upon her time&mdash;Robert
seconds him with almost incredible brevity&mdash;someone else thanks Robert and
myself for throwing open these magnificent grounds&mdash;(tennis-court, three flower
borders, and microscopic shrubbery)&mdash;I look at Robert, who shakes his head,
thus obliging me to make necessary reply myself, and our Vicar's wife, with
undeniable presence of mind, darts forward and reminds Lady F. that she has
forgotten to declare the F&Atilde;&ordf;te open. This is at once done and we disperse to
stalls and sideshows.</p>
<p>Am stopped by Lady B., who asks reproachfully, Didn't I know that she would
have been perfectly ready to open the F&Atilde;&ordf;te herself, if I had asked her? Another
time, she says, I am not to hesitate for a <i>moment</i>. She then spends
ninepence on a lavender bag, and drives off again with expensive-looking
friends. This behaviour provides topic of excited conversation for us all,
throughout the whole of the afternoon.</p>
<p>Everyone else buys nobly, unsuitable articles are raffled&mdash;(raffling
illegal, winner to pay sixpence)&mdash;guesses are made as to contents of sealed
boxes, number of currants in large cake, weight of bilious-looking ham, and so
on. Band arrives, is established on lawn, and plays selections from <i>The
Geisha</i>. Mademoiselle's boot-bag bought by elegant purchaser in grey
flannels, who turns out, on closer inspection, to be Howard Fitzsimmons. Just
as I recover from this, Robin, in wild excitement, informs me that he has won a
Goat in a raffle. (Goat has fearful local reputation, and is of immense age and
savageness.) Have no time to do more than say how <i>nice</i> this is, and he
had better run and tell Daddy, before old Mrs. B., Barbara, C. C., and Cousin
Maud all turn up together. (Can baby Austin <i>possibly</i> have accommodated
them all?) Old Mrs. B. rather less subdued than at our last meeting, and goes
so far as to say that she has very little money to spend, but that she always
thinks a smile and a kind word are better than gold, with which I inwardly
disagree.</p>
<p>Am definitely glad to perceive that C. C. has taken up cast-iron attitude of
unfriendliness towards Cousin Maud, and contradicts her whenever she speaks.
Sports, tea, and dancing on the tennis-lawn all successful&mdash;(except possibly
from point of view of future tennis-parties)&mdash;and even Robin and Vicky do not
dream of eating final ice cream cornets, and retiring to bed, until ten
o'clock.</p>
<p>Robert, Rose, Cissie Crabbe, Helen Wills, and myself all sit in the
drawing-room in pleasant state of exhaustion, and congratulate ourselves and
one another. Robert has information, no doubt reliable, but source remains
mysterious, to the effect that we have Cleared Three Figures. All, for the
moment, is <i>couleur-de-rose</i>.</p>
<p><i>June 23rd.</i>&mdash;Tennis-party at wealthy and elaborate house, to which
Robert and I now bidden for the first time. (Also, probably, the last.) Immense
opulence of host and hostess at once discernible in fabulous display of
deck-chairs, all of complete stability and miraculous cleanliness. Am
introduced to youngish lady in yellow, and serious young man with horn-rimmed
spectacles. Lady in yellow says at once that she is sure I have a lovely
garden. (Why?)</p>
<p>Elderly, but efficient-looking, partner is assigned to me, and we play
against the horn-rimmed spectacles and agile young creature in expensive
crepe-de-chine. Realise at once that all three play very much better tennis
than I do. Still worse, realise that <i>they</i> realise this. Just as we
begin, my partner observes gravely that he ought to tell me he is a left-handed
player. Cannot imagine what he expects me to do about it, lose my head, and
reply madly that That is Splendid.</p>
<p>Game proceeds, I serve several double-faults, and elderly partner becomes
graver and graver. At beginning of each game he looks at me and repeats score
with fearful distinctness, which, as it is never in our favour, entirely
unnerves me. At "Six-<i>one</i>" we leave the court and silently seek chairs as
far removed from one another as possible. Find myself in vicinity of Our
Member, and we talk about the Mace, peeresses in the House of Lords&mdash;on which
we differ&mdash;winter sports, and Alsatian dogs.</p>
<p>Robert plays tennis, and does well.</p>
<p>Later on, am again bidden to the court and, to my unspeakable horror, told
to play once more with elderly and efficient partner.</p>
<p>I apologise to him for this misfortune, and he enquires in return, with
extreme pessimism. Fifty years from now, what will it matter if we <i>have</i>
lost this game? Neighbouring lady&mdash;probably his wife?&mdash;looks agitated at this,
and supplements it by incoherent assurances about its being a great pleasure,
in any case. Am well aware that she is lying, but intention evidently very
kind, for which I feel grateful. Play worse than ever, and am not unprepared
for subsequent enquiry from hostess as to whether I think I have <i>really</i>
quite got over the measles, as she has heard that it often takes a full year. I
reply, humorously, that, so far as tennis goes, it will take far more than a
full year. Perceive by expression of civil perplexity on face of hostess that
she has entirely failed to grasp this rather subtle witticism, and wish that I
hadn't made it. Am still thinking about this failure, when I notice that
conversation has, mysteriously, switched on to the United States of Ameerca,
about which we are all very emphatic. Americans, we say, undoubtedly
<i>hospitable</i>&mdash;but what about the War Debt? What about Prohibition? What
about Sinclair Lewis? Aim&eacute;e MacPherson, and Co-education? By the time we
have done with them, it transpires that none of is have ever been to America,
but all hold definite views, which fortunately coincide with the views of
everybody else.</p>
<p>(Query: Could not interesting little experiment he tried, by possessor of
unusual amount of moral courage, in the shape of suddenly producing perfectly
brand-new opinion: for example, to the effect that Americans have better
manners than we have, or that their divorce laws are a great improvement upon
our own? Should much like to see effect of these, or similar, psychological
bombs, but should definitely wish Robert to he absent from the scene.)</p>
<p>Announcement of tea breaks off these intelligent speculations.</p>
<p>Am struck, as usual, by infinite superiority of other people's food to my
own.</p>
<p>Conversation turns upon Lady B. and everyone says she is really very
kindhearted, and follows this up by anecdotes illustrating all her less
attractive qualities. Youngish lady in yellow declares that she met Lady B.
last week in London, face three inches thick in new sunburn-tan. Can quite
believe it. Feel much more at home after this, and conscious of new bond of
union cementing entire party. Sidelight thus thrown upon human nature
regrettable, but not to be denied. Even tennis improves after this, entirely
owing to my having told funny story relating to Lady B.'s singular behaviour
in regard to local Jumble Sale, which meets with success. Serve fewer
double-faults, but still cannot quite escape conviction that whoever plays with
me invariably loses the set&mdash;which I cannot believe to be mere coincidence.</p>
<p>Suggest to Robert, on the way home, that I had better give up tennis
altogether, to which, after long silence&mdash;during which I hope he is perhaps
evolving short speech that shall be at once complimentary and yet
convincing&mdash;he replies that he does not know what I could take up instead. As I
do not know either, the subject is dropped, and we return home in silence.</p>
<p><i>June 27th.</i>&mdash;Cook says that unless I am willing to let her have the
Sweep, she cannot possibly be responsible for the stove. I say that of course
she can have the Sweep. If not, Cook returns, totally disregarding this, she
really can't say what won't happen. I reiterate my complete readiness to send
the Sweep a summons on the instant, and Cook continues to look away from me and
to repeat that unless I <i>will</i> agree to having the Sweep in, there's no
knowing.</p>
<p>This dialogue&mdash;cannot say why&mdash;upsets me for the remainder of the day.</p>
<p><i>June 30th.</i>&mdash;The Sweep comes, and devastates the entire day.
Bath-water and meals are alike cold, and soot appears quite irrelevantly in
portions of the house totally removed from sphere of Sweep's activities. Am
called upon in the middle of the day to produce twelve-and-sixpence in cash,
which I cannot do. Appeal to everybody in the house, and find that nobody else
can, either. Finally Cook announces that the Joint has just come and can oblige
at the back door, if I don't mind its going down in the book. I do not, and the
Sweep is accordingly paid and disappears on a motor-bicycle.</p>
<p><i>July 3rd.</i>&mdash;Breakfast enlivened by letter from dear Rose written at,
apparently, earthly paradise of blue sea and red rocks, on South Coast of
France. She says that she is having complete rest, and enjoying congenial
society of charming group of friends, and makes unprecedented suggestion that I
should join her for a fortnight. I am moved to exclaim&mdash;perhaps rather
thoughtlessly&mdash;that the most wonderful thing in the world must be to be a
childless widow&mdash;but this is met by unsympathetic silence from Robert, which
recalls me to myself, and impels me to say that that isn't in the least what I
meant.</p>
<p>(<i>Mem</i>.: Should often be very, very sorry to explain exactly what it is
that I <i>do</i> mean, and am in fact conscious of deliberately avoiding
self-analysis on many occasions. Do not propose, however, to go into this now
or at any other time.)</p>
<p>I tell Robert that if it wasn't for the expense, and not having any clothes,
and the servants, and leaving Vicky, I should think seriously of Rose's
suggestion. Why, I enquire rhetorically, should Lady B. have a monopoly of the
South of France? Robert replies, Well&mdash;and pauses for such a long while that I
get agitated, and have mentally gone through the Divorce Court with him, before
he ends up by saying Well, again, and picking up the <i>Western Morning
News</i>. Feel&mdash;but do not say&mdash;that this, as contribution to discussion, is
inadequate. Am prepared, however, to continue it single-handed sooner than
allow subject to drop altogether. Do so, but am interrupted first by entrance
of Helen Wills through the window&mdash;(Robert says, Dam' that cat, I shall have it
drowned, but only absent-mindedly)&mdash;and then by spirit-lamp, which is
discovered to be extinct, and to require new wick. Robert strongly in favour of
ringing immediately, but I discourage this, and undertake to speak about it
instead, and tie knot in pocket-handkerchief. (Unfortunately overcharged memory
fails later when in kitchen, and find myself unable to recollect whether
marmalade has run to sugar through remaining too long in jar, or merely
porridge lumpier than usual&mdash;but this a digression.)</p>
<p>I read Rose's letter all over again, and feel that I have here opportunity
of a lifetime. Suddenly hear myself exclaiming passionately that Travel
broadens the Mind, and am immediately reminded of our Vicar's wife, who
frequently makes similar remark before taking our Vicar to spend fortnight's
holiday in North Wales.</p>
<p>Robert finally says Well, again&mdash;this time tone of voice slightly more
lenient&mdash;and then asks if it is quite impossible for his bottle of Eno's to be
left undisturbed on bathroom shelf?</p>
<p>I at once and severely condemn Mademoiselle as undoubted culprit, although
guiltily aware that original suggestion probably emanated from myself. And
what, I add, about the South of France? Robert looks astounded, and soon
afterwards leaves the dining-room without having spoken.</p>
<p>I deal with my correspondence, omitting Rose's letter. Remainder boils down
to rather uninspiring collection of Accounts Rendered, offensive little
pamphlet that makes searching enquiry into the state of my gums, postcard from
County Secretary of Women's Institutes with notice of meeting that I am
expected to attend, and warmly worded personal communication addressed me by
name from unknown Titled Gentleman, which ends up with a request for five
shillings if I cannot spare more, in aid of charity in which he is interested.
Whole question of South of France is shelved until evening, when I seek
Mademoiselle in schoolroom, after Vicky has gone to bed. Am horrified to see
that supper, awaiting her on the table, consists of cheese, pickles, and slice
of jam roly-poly, grouped on single plate&mdash;(Would not this suggest to the
artistic mind a Still-life Study in Modern Art?)&mdash;flanked by colossal jug of
cold water. Is this, I ask, what Mademoiselle <i>likes</i>? She assures me that
it is and adds, austerely, that food is of no importance to her. She could go
without anything for days and days, without noticing it. From her early
childhood, she has always been the same.</p>
<p>(Query unavoidably suggests itself here: Does Mademoiselle really expect me
to believe her, and if so, what can be her opinion of my mental capacity?)</p>
<p>We discuss Vicky: tendency to argumentativeness, I hint. "C'est un petit
coeur d 'or," returns Mademoiselle immediately. I agree, in modified terms, and
Mademoiselle at once points out dear Vicky's undeniable obstinacy and
self-will, and goes so far as to say: "Plus tard, ce sera un esprit fort...elle
ira loin, cette petite."</p>
<p>I bring up the subject of the South of France. Mademoiselle more than
sympathetic, assures me that I must, at all costs, go, adding&mdash;a little
unnecessarily&mdash;that I have grown many, many years older in the last few months,
and that to live as I do, without any distractions, only leads to madness in
the end.</p>
<p>Feel that she could hardly have worded this more trenchantly, and am a good
deal impressed.</p>
<p>(Query: Would Robert see the force of these representations, or not? Robert
apt to take rather prejudiced view of all that is not purely English.)</p>
<p>Return to drawing-room and find Robert asleep behind the <i>Times</i>. Read
Rose's letter all over again, and am moved to make list of clothes that I
should require if I joined her, estimate of expenses&mdash;financial situation,
though not scintillating, still considerably brighter than usual, owing to
recent legacy&mdash;and even Notes, on back of envelope, of instructions to be given
to Mademoiselle, Cook, and the tradespeople, before leaving.</p>
<p><i>July 6th.</i>&mdash;Decide definitely on joining Rose at Ste. Agathe, and
write and tell her so. Die now cast, and Rubicon crossed&mdash;or rather will be, on
achieving further side of the Channel. Robert, on the whole, takes lenient view
of entire project, and says he supposes that nothing else will satisfy me, and
better not count on really hot weather promised by Rose but take good supply of
woollen underwear. Mademoiselle is sympathetic, but theatrical, and exclaims:
"C'est la Ste. Vierge qui a tout arrang&Atilde;&copy;!" which sounds like a travel agency,
and shocks me.</p>
<p>Go to Women's Institute Meeting and tell our Secretary that I am afraid I
shall have to miss our next Committee Meeting. She immediately replies that the
date can easily be altered. I protest, but am defeated by small calendar, which
she at once produces, and begs me to select my own date, and says that It will
be All the Same to the eleven other members of the Committee.</p>
<p>(Have occasional misgivings at recollection of rousing speeches made by
various speakers from our National Federation, to the effect that all W.I.
members enjoy equal responsibilities and equal privileges...Can only hope that
none of them will ever have occasion to enter more fully into the inner
workings of our Monthly Committee Meetings.)</p>
<p><i>July 12th.</i>&mdash;Pay farewell calls, and receive much good advice. Our
Vicar says that it is madness to drink water anywhere in France, unless
previously boiled and filtered; our Vicar's wife shares Robert's distrust as to
climate, and advises Jaeger next the skin, and also offers loan of small
travelling medicine-chest for emergencies. Discussion follows as to whether
Bisulphate of Quinine is, or is not, dutiable article, and is finally brought
to inconclusive conclusion by our Vicar's pronouncing definitely that, in
<i>any</i> case, Honesty is the Best Policy.</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Blenkinsop&mdash;whom I reluctantly visit whenever I get a letter from
Barbara saying how grateful she is for my kindness&mdash;adopts quavering and
enfeebled manner, and hopes she may be here to welcome me home again on my
return, but implies that this is not really to be anticipated. I say Come,
come, and begin well-turned sentence as to Mrs. B.'s wonderful vitality, when
Cousin Maud bounces in, and inspiration fails me on the spot. What Ho! says
Cousin Maud&mdash;(or at least, produces the effect of having said it, though
possibly slang slightly more up-to-date than this&mdash;but not much)&mdash;What is all
this about our cutting a dash on the Lido or somewhere, and leaving our home to
take care of itself? Talk about the Emancipation of Females, says Cousin Maud.
Should like to reply that no one, except herself, ever <i>does</i> talk about
it&mdash;but feel this might reasonably be construed as uncivil, and do not want to
upset unfortunate old Mrs. B., whom I now regard as a victim pure and simple.
Ignore Cousin Maud, and ask old Mrs. B. what books she would advise me to take.
Amount of luggage strictly limited, both as to weight and size, but could
manage two very long ones, if in pocket editions, and another to be carried in
coat-pocket for journey.</p>
<p>Old Mrs. B.&mdash;probably still intent on thought of approaching
dissolution&mdash;suddenly says that there is nothing like the Bible&mdash;suggestion
which I feel might more properly have been left to our Vicar. Naturally, give
her to understand that I agree, but do not commit myself further. Cousin Maud,
in a positive way that annoys me, recommends No book At All, especially when
crossing the sea. It is well known, she affirms, that any attempt to fix the
eyes on printed page while ship is moving induces sea-sickness quicker than
anything else. Better repeat poetry, or the multiplication-table, as this
serves to distract the mind. Have no assurance that the multiplication-table is
at my command, but do not reveal this to Cousin Maud.</p>
<p>Old Mrs. B., abandoning Scriptural attitude, now says, Give her Shakespeare.
Everything is to be found in Shakespeare. Look at <i>King Lear</i>, she says.
Cousin Maud assents with customary energy&mdash;but should be prepared to take
considerable bet that she has never read a word of <i>King Lear</i> since it
was&mdash;presumably&mdash;stuffed down her throat at dear old Roedean, in intervals of
cricket and hockey.</p>
<p>We touch on literature in general&mdash;old Mrs. B. observes that much that is
published nowadays seems to her unnecessary, and why so much Sex in
everything?&mdash;Cousin Maud says that books collect dust, anyway, and whisks away
inoffensive copy of <i>Time and Tide</i> with which old Mrs. B. is evidently
solacing herself in intervals of being hustled in and out of baby Austin&mdash;and I
take my leave. Am embraced by old Mrs. B. (who shows tendency to have one of
her old-time Attacks, but is briskly headed off it by Cousin Maud) and slapped
on the back by Cousin Maud in familiar and extremely offensive manner.</p>
<p>Walk home, and am overtaken by well-known blue Bentley, from which Lady B.
waves elegantly, and commands chauffeur to stop. He does so, and Lady B. says,
Get in, Get in, never mind muddy boots&mdash;which makes me feel like a plough-boy.
Good works, she supposes, have been taking me plodding round the village as
usual? The way I go on, day after day, is too marvellous. Reply with utmost
distinctness that I am just on the point of starting for the South of France,
where I am joining party of distinguished friends. (This not entirely untrue,
since dear Rose has promised introduction to many interesting acquaintances,
including Viscountess.)</p>
<p>Really, says Lady B. But why not go at the right time of year? Or why not go
all the way by sea?&mdash;yachting too marvellous. Or why not, again, make it
Scotland, instead of France?</p>
<p>Do not reply to any of all this, and request to be put down at the corner.
This is done, and Lady B. waves directions to chauffeur to drive on, but
subsequently stops him again, and leans out to say that she can find out all
about quite inexpensive <i>pensions</i> for me if I like. I do <i>not</i> like,
and we part finally.</p>
<p>Find myself indulging in rather melodramatic fantasy of Bentley crashing
into enormous motor-bus and being splintered to atoms. Permit chauffeur to
escape unharmed, but fate of Lady B. left uncertain, owing to ineradicable
impression of earliest childhood to the effect that It is Wicked to wish for
the Death of Another. Do not consider, however, that severe injuries, with
possible disfigurement, come under this law&mdash;but entire topic unprofitable, and
had better be dismissed.</p>
<p><i>July 14th.</i>&mdash;Question of books to be taken abroad undecided till late
hour last night. Robert says, Why take any? and Vicky proffers <i>Les Malheurs
de Sophie</i>, which she puts into the very bottom of my suit-case, whence it
is extracted with some difficulty by Mademoiselle later. Finally decide on
<i>Little Dorrit</i> and <i>The Daisy Chain</i>, with <i>Jane Eyre</i> in
coat-pocket. Should prefer to be the kind of person who is inseparable from
volume of Keats, or even Jane Austen, but cannot compass this.</p>
<p><i>July 15th.</i>&mdash;<i>Mem.</i>: Remind Robert before starting that Gladys's
wages due on Saturday. Speak about having my room turned out. Speak about
laundry. Speak to Mademoiselle about Vicky's teeth, glycothymoline, Helen Wills
<i>not</i> on bed, and lining of tussore coat. Write butcher. Wash hair.</p>
<p><i>July 17th.</i>&mdash;Robert sees me off by early train for London, after
scrambled and agitating departure, exclusively concerned with frantic
endeavours to induce suit-case to shut. This is at last accomplished, but
leaves me with conviction that it will be at least equally difficult to induce
it to open again. Vicky bids me cheerful, but affectionate, good-bye and then
shatters me at eleventh hour by enquiring trustfully if I shall be home in time
to read to her after tea? As entire extent of absence has already been
explained to her in full, this enquiry merely senseless&mdash;but serves to unnerve
me badly, especially as Mademoiselle ejaculates: "Ah! la pauvre ch&egrave;re
mignonne!" into the blue.</p>
<p>(<i>Mem</i>.: The French very often carried away by emotionalism to wholly
preposterous lengths.)</p>
<p>Cook, Gladys, and the gardener stand at hall-door and hope that I shall
enjoy my holiday, and Cook adds a rider to the effect that It seems to be
blowing up for a gale, and for her part, she has always had a Norror of death
by drowning. On this, we drive away.</p>

<p>Arrive at station too early&mdash;as usual&mdash;and I fill in time by asking Robert
if he will telegraph if anything happens to the children, as I could be back
again in twenty-four hours. He only enquires in return whether I have my
passport? Am perfectly aware that passport is in my small purple dressing-case,
where I put it a week ago, and have looked at it two or three times every day
ever since&mdash;last time just before leaving my room forty-five minutes ago. Am
nevertheless mysteriously impelled to open hand-bag, take out key, unlock small
purple dressing-case, and verify presence of passport all over again.</p>
<p>(Query: Is not behaviour of this kind well known in therapeutic circles as
symptomatic of mental derangement? Vague but disquieting association here with
singular behaviour of Dr. Johnson in London streets&mdash;but too painful to be
pursued to a finish.)</p>
<p>Arrival of train, and I say good-bye to Robert, and madly enquire if he
would rather I gave up going at all? He rightly ignores this altogether.</p>
<p>(Query: Would not extremely distressing situation arise if similar impulsive
offer were one day to be accepted? This gives rise to unavoidable speculation
in regard to sincerity of such offers, and here again, issue too painful to be
frankly faced, and am obliged to shelve train of thought altogether.)</p>
<p>Turn my attention to fellow-traveller&mdash;distrustful-looking woman with grey
hair&mdash;who at once informs me that door of lavatory&mdash;opening out of
compartment&mdash;has defective lock, and will not stay shut. I say Oh, in tone of
sympathetic concern, and shut door. It remains shut. We watch it anxiously, and
it flies open again. Later on, fellow-traveller makes fresh attempt, with
similar result. Much of the journey spent in this exercise. I observe
thoughtfully that Hope springs eternal in the human breast, and
fellow-traveller looks more distrustful than ever. She finally says in
despairing tones that Really, it isn't what she calls very nice, and lapses
into depressed silence. Door remains triumphantly open.</p>
<p>Drive from Waterloo to Victoria, take out passport in taxi in order to Have
It Ready, then decide safer to put it back again in dressing-case, which I do.
(Dr. Johnson recrudesces faintly, but is at once dismissed.) Observe with
horror that trees in Grosvenor Gardens are swaying with extreme violence in
stiff gale of wind.</p>
<p>Change English money into French at Victoria Station, where superior young
gentleman in little kiosk refuses to let me have anything smaller than
one-hundred franc notes. I ask what use that will be when it comes to porters,
but superior young gentleman remains adamant. Infinitely competent person in
blue and gold, labelled Dean &amp; Dawson, comes to my rescue, miraculously
provides me with change, says Have I booked a seat, pilots me to it, and tells
me that he represents the best-known Travel Agency in London. I assure him
warmly that I shall never patronise any other&mdash;which is true&mdash;and we part with
mutual esteem. I make note on half of torn luggage-label to the effect that it
would be merest honesty to write and congratulate D. &amp; D. on admirable
employee&mdash;but feel that I shall probably never do it.</p>
<p>Journey to Folkestone entirely occupied in looking out of train window and
seeing quite large trees bowed to earth by force of wind. Cook's words recur
most unpleasantly. Also recall various forms of advice received, and find it
difficult to decide between going instantly to the Ladies' Saloon, taking off
my hat, and lying down Perfectly Flat&mdash;(Mademoiselle's suggestion)&mdash;or Keeping
in the Fresh Air at All Costs and Thinking about Other Things&mdash;(course
advocated on a postcard by Aunt Gertrude). Choice taken out of my hands by
discovery that Ladies' Saloon is entirely filled, within five minutes of going
on board, by other people, who have all taken off their hats and are lying down
Perfectly Flat.</p>

</center>
<p>Return to deck, sit on suit-case, and decide to Think about Other Things.
Schoolmaster and his wife, who are going to Boulogne for a holiday, talk to one
another across me about University Extension Course, and appear to be superior
to the elements. I take out <i>Jane Eyre</i> from coatpocket&mdash;partly in faint
hope of impressing them, and partly to distract my mind&mdash;but remember Cousin
Maud, and am forced to conclusion that she may have been right. Perhaps advice
equally correct in respect of repeating poetry? Can think of nothing whatever,
except extraordinary damp chill which appears to be creeping over me.
Schoolmaster suddenly says to me: "Quite all <i>right</i>, aren't you?" To
which I reply, Oh yes, and he laughs in a bright and scholastic way, and talks
about the Matterhorn. Although unaware of any conscious recollection of it,
find myself inwardly repeating curious and ingenious example of alliterative
verse, committed to memory in my schooldays. (<i>Note:</i> Can dimly understand
why the dying revert to impressions of early infancy.)</p>
<p>Just as I get to:</p>
<blockquote>"Cossack Commanders cannonading come<br>
Dealing destruction's devastating doom&mdash;"</blockquote>
<p>elements overcome me altogether. Have dim remembrance of hearing
schoolmaster exclaim in authoritative tones to everybody within earshot: "Make
way for this lady&mdash;she is <i>Ill</i>"&mdash;which injunction he repeats every time I
am compelled to leave suitcase. Throughout intervals, I continue to grapple,
more or less deliriously, with alliterative poem, and do not give up altogether
until</p>
<blockquote>"Reason returns, religious rights redound"</blockquote>
<p>is reached. This I consider creditable.</p>
<p>Attain Boulogne at last, discover reserved seat in train, am told by several
officials whom I question that we do, or alternatively, do not, change when we
reach Paris, give up the elucidation of the point for the moment, and
demand&mdash;and obtain small glass of brandy, which restores me.</p>
<p><i>July 18th, at Ste. Agathe.</i>&mdash;Vicissitudes of travel very strange, and
am struck&mdash;as often&mdash;by enormous dissimilarity between journeys undertaken in
real life, and as reported in fiction. Can remember very few novels in which
train journey of any kind does not involve either (a) Hectic encounter with
member of opposite sex, leading to tense emotional issue; (b) discovery of
murdered body in hideously battered condition, under circumstances which
utterly defy detection; (c) elopement between two people each of whom is
married to somebody else, culminating in severe disillusionment, or lofty
renunciation.</p>
<p>Nothing of all this enlivens my own peregrinations, but on the other hand,
the night not without incident.</p>
<p>Second-class carriage full, and am not fortunate enough to obtain
corner-seat. American young gentleman sits opposite, and elderly French couple,
with talkative friend wearing blue b&eacute;ret, who trims his nails with a
pocket-knife and tells us about the state of the wine-trade.</p>
<p>I have dusty and elderly mother in black on one side, and her two
sons&mdash;names turn out to be Guguste and D&eacute;d&eacute;&mdash;on the other.
(D&eacute;d&eacute; looks about fifteen, but wears socks, which I think a
mistake, but must beware of insularity.)</p>
<p>Towards eleven o'clock we all subside into silence, except the blue
b&eacute;ret, who is now launched on tennis-champions, and has much to say
about all of them. American young gentleman looks uneasy at mention of any of
his compatriots, but evidently does not understand enough French to follow blue
b&eacute;ret's remarks&mdash;which is as well.</p>
<p>Just as we all&mdash;except indefatigable b&eacute;ret, now eating small
sausage-rolls&mdash;drop one by one into slumber, train stops at station and
fragments of altercation break out in corridor concerning admission, or
otherwise, of someone evidently accompanied by large dog. This is opposed by
masculine voice repeating steadily, at short intervals: "Un chien n'est pas une
personne," and heavily backed by assenting chorus, repeating after him: "Mais
non, un chien n'est pas une personne."</p>
<p>To this I fall asleep, but wake a long time afterwards, to sounds of
appealing enquiry, floating in from corridor: "Mais voyons&mdash;N'est-ce pas qu'un
chien n'est pas une personne?"</p>
<center>
<p><a name="0800661h-18" id="0800661h-18"></a><img alt="" src=
"0800661h-images/0800661h-18.jpg"></p>
</center>
<p>The point still unsettled when I sleep again, and in the morning no more is
heard, and I speculate in vain as to whether owner of the <i>chien</i> remained
with him on the station, or is having <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>
journey with him in separate carriage altogether. Wash inadequately, in
extremely dirty accommodation provided, after waiting some time in lengthy
queue. Make distressing discovery that there is no way of obtaining breakfast
until train halts at Avignon. Break this information later to American young
gentleman, who falls into deep distress and says that he does not know the
French for grapefruit. Neither do I, but am able to inform him decisively that
he will not require it.</p>
<p>Train is late, and does not reach Avignon till nearly ten. American young
gentleman has a severe panic, and assures me that if he leaves the train it
will start without him. This happened once before at Davenport, Iowa. In order
to avoid similar calamity, on this occasion, I offer to procure him a cup of
coffee and two rolls, and successfully do so&mdash;but attend first to my own
requirements. We all brighten after this, and Guguste announces his intention
of shaving. His mother screams, and says, "Mais c'est fou"&mdash;with which I
privately agree&mdash;and everybody else remonstrates with Guguste (except
D&eacute;d&eacute;, who is wrapped in gloom), and points out that the train is
rocking, and he will cut himself. The blue b&eacute;ret goes so far as to
predict that he will decapitate himself, at which everybody screams.</p>
<p>Guguste remains adamant, and produces shaving apparatus and a little mug,
which is given to D&eacute;d&eacute; to hold. We sit around in great suspense,
and Guguste is supported by one elbow by his mother, while he conducts
operations to a conclusion which produces no perceptible change whatever in his
appearance.</p>
<p>After this excitement, we all suffer from reaction, and sink into hot and
dusty silence. Scenery gets rocky and sandy, with heat-haze shimmering over
all, and occasional glimpses of bright blue-and-green sea.</p>
<p>At intervals train stops, and ejects various people. We lose the elderly
French couple&mdash;who leave a Thermos behind them and have to be screamed at by
Guguste from the window&mdash;and then the blue b&eacute;ret, eloquent to the last,
and turning round on the platform to bow as train moves off again. Guguste,
D&Atilde;&copy;d&Atilde;&copy;, and the mother remain with me to the end, as they are going on as far as
Antibes. American young gentleman gets out when I do, but lose sight of him
altogether in excitement of meeting Rose, charming in yellow embroidered linen.
She says that she is glad to see me, and adds that I look a Rag&mdash;which is true,
as I discover on reaching hotel and looking-glass&mdash;but kindly omits to add that
I have smuts on my face, and that petticoat has mysteriously descended two and
a half inches below my dress, imparting final touch of degradation to general
appearance.</p>
<p>She recommends bath and bed, and I agree to both, but refuse proffered cup
of tea, feeling this would be altogether too reminiscent of English
countryside, and quite out of place. I ask, insanely, if letters from home are
awaiting me&mdash;which, unless they were written before I left, they could not
possibly be. Rose enquires after Robert and the children, and when I reply that
I feel I ought not really to have come away without them, she again recommends
bed. Feel that she is right, and go there.</p>

</center>
<p><i>July 23rd.</i>&mdash;Cannot avoid contrasting deliriously rapid flight of time
when on a holiday, with very much slower passage of days and even hours, in
other and more familiar surroundings.</p>
<p>(<i>Mem</i>.: This disposes once and for all of fallacy that days seem long
when spent in complete idleness. They seem, on the contrary, very much longer
when filled with ceaseless activities.)</p>
<p>Rose&mdash;always so gifted in discovering attractive and interesting friends&mdash;is
established in circle of gifted&mdash;and in some cases actually
celebrated&mdash;personalities. We all meet daily on rocks, and bathe in sea.
Temperature and surroundings very, very different to those of English Channel
or Atlantic Ocean, and consequently find myself emboldened to the extent of
quite active swimming. Cannot, however, compete with Viscountess, who dives, or
her friend, who has unique and very striking method of doing back-fall into the
water. Am, indeed, led away by spirit of emulation into attempting dive on one
solitary occasion, and am convinced that I have plumbed the depths of the
Mediterranean&mdash;have doubts, in fact, of ever leaving it again&mdash;but on enquiring
of extremely kind spectator&mdash;(famous Headmistress)&mdash;How I went In, she replies
gently: About level with the Water, she thinks&mdash;and we say no more about
it.</p>
<p><i>July 25th.</i>&mdash;Vicky writes affectionately, but briefly&mdash;Mademoiselle at
greater length, and quite illegibly, but evidently full of hopes that I am
enjoying myself. Am touched, and send each a picture-postcard. Robin's letter,
written from school, arrives later, and contains customary allusions to boys
unknown to me, also information that he has asked two of them to come and stay
with him in the holidays, and has accepted invitation to spend a week with
another. Postscript adds straightforward enquiry, Have I bought any chocolate
yet?</p>
<p>I do so forthwith.</p>
<p><i>July 26th.</i>&mdash;Observe in the glass that I look ten years younger than
on arrival here, and am gratified. This, moreover, in spite of what I cannot
help viewing as perilous adventure recently experienced in (temporarily) choppy
sea, agitated by <i>vent d'est</i>, in which no one but Rose's Viscountess
attempts to swim. She indicates immense and distant rock, and announces her
intention of swimming to it. I say that I will go too. Long before we are
half-way there, I know that I shall never reach it, and hope that Robert's
second wife will be kind to the children. Viscountess, swimming calmly, says,
Am I all right? I reply, Oh quite, and am immediately submerged.</p>
<p>(Query: Is this a Judgement?)</p>
<p>Continue to swim. Rock moves further and further away. I reflect that there
will be something distinguished about the headlines announcing my demise in
such exalted company, and mentally frame one or two that I think would look
well in local paper. Am just turning my attention to paragraph in our Parish
Magazine when I hit a small rock, and am immediately submerged again.
Mysteriously rise again from the foam&mdash;though not in the least, as I know too
well, like Venus.</p>
<p>Death by drowning said to be preceded by mental panorama of entire past
life. Distressing reflection which very nearly causes me to sink again. Even
one recollection from my past, if injudiciously selected, disconcerts me in the
extreme, and cannot at all contemplate entire series. Suddenly perceive that
space between myself and rock has actually diminished. Viscountess&mdash;who has
kept near me and worn slightly anxious expression throughout&mdash;achieves it
safely, and presently find myself grasping at sharp projections with tips of my
fingers and bleeding profusely at the knees. Perceive that I have been, as they
say, Spared.</p>
<p>(<i>Mem</i>.: Must try and discover for what purpose, if any.)</p>
<p>Am determined to take this colossal achievement as a matter of course, and
merely make literary reference to Byron swimming the Hellespont&mdash;which would
sound better if said in less of a hurry, and when not obliged to gasp, and spit
out several gallons of water.</p>
<p>Minor, but nerve-racking, little problem here suggests itself: What
substitute for a pocket-handkerchief exists when sea-bathing? Can conceive of
no occasion&mdash;except possibly funeral of nearest and dearest&mdash;when this homely
little article more frequently and urgently required. Answer, when it comes,
anything but satisfactory.</p>
<p>I say that I am cold&mdash;which is true&mdash;and shall go back across the rocks.
Viscountess, with remarkable tact, does not attempt to dissuade me, and I
go.</p>
<p><i>July 27th.</i>&mdash;End of holiday quite definitely in sight, and everyone
very kindly says, Why not stay on? I refer, in return, to Robert and the
children&mdash;and add, though not aloud, the servants, the laundry, the Women's
Institute, repainting the outside of bath, and the state of my overdraft.
Everyone expresses civil regret at my departure, and I go so far as to declare
recklessly that I shall be coming back next year&mdash;which I well know to be
unlikely in the extreme.</p>
<p>Spend last evening sending picture-postcards to everyone to whom I have been
intending to send them ever since I started.</p>
<p><i>July 29th, London.</i>&mdash;Return journey accomplished under greatly
improved conditions, travelling first-class in company with one of Rose's most
distinguished friends. (Should much like to run across Lady B. by chance in
Paris or elsewhere, but no such gratifying coincidence supervenes. Shall take
care, however, to let her know circles in which I have been moving.)</p>
<p>Crossing as tempestuous as ever, and again have recourse to "An Austrian
Army" with same lack of success as before. Boat late, train even more so, last
available train for west of England has left Paddington long before I reach
Victoria, and am obliged to stay night in London. Put through long-distance
call to tell Robert this, but line is, as usual, in a bad way, and all I can
hear is "What?" As Robert, on his side, can apparently hear even less, we do
not get far. I find that I have no money, in spite of having borrowed from
Rose&mdash;expenditure, as invariably happens, has exceeded estimate&mdash;but confide
all to Secretary of my club, who agrees to trust me, but adds, rather
disconcertingly&mdash;"as it's for one night only".</p>
<p><i>July 30th.</i>&mdash;Readjustment sometimes rather difficult, after absence of
unusual length and character.</p>
<p><i>July 31st.</i>&mdash;The beginning of the holidays signalled, as usual, by the
making of appointments with dentist and doctor. Photographs taken at Ste.
Agathe arrive, and I am&mdash;perhaps naturally&mdash;much more interested in them than
anybody else appears to be. (Bathing dress shows up as being even more becoming
than I thought it was, though hair, on the other hand, not at its
best&mdash;probably owing to salt water.) Notice, regretfully, how much more time I
spend in studying views of myself, than on admirable group of delightful
friends, or even beauties of Nature, as exemplified in camera studies of sea
and sky.</p>
<p>Presents for Vicky, Mademoiselle, and our Vicar's wife all meet with
acclamation, and am gratified. Blue flowered chintz frock, however, bought at
Ste. Agathe for sixty-three francs, no longer becoming to me, as sunburn fades
and original sallowness returns to view. Even Mademoiselle, usually so
sympathetic in regard to clothes, eyes chintz frock doubtfully, and says,
"Tiens! On dirait un bal masqu&eacute;." As she knows, and I know, that the
neighbourhood never has, and never will, run to <i>bals masqu&eacute;s</i>,
this equals unqualified condemnation of blue chintz, and I remove it in silence
to furthest corner of the wardrobe.</p>
<p>Helen Wills, says Cook, about to produce more kittens. Cannot say if Robert
does, or does not, know this.</p>
<p>Spend much time in writing to, and hearing from, unknown mothers whose sons
have been invited here by Robin, and one grandmother, with whose descendant
Robin is to spend a week. Curious impossibility of combining dates and trains
convenient to us all, renders this whole question harassing in the extreme.
Grandmother, especially, sends unlimited letters and telegrams, to all of which
I feel bound to reply&mdash;mostly with civil assurances of gratitude for her
kindness in having Robin to stay. Very, very difficult to think of new ways of
wording this&mdash;moreover, must reserve something for letter I shall have to write
when visit is safely over.</p>
<p><i>August 1st:</i>&mdash;Return of Robin, who has grown, and looks pale. He has
also purchased large bottle of brilliantine, and applied it to his hair, which
smells like inferior chemist's shop. Do not like to be unsympathetic about
this, so merely remain silent while Vicky exclaims rapturously that it is
<i>lovely</i>&mdash;which is also Robin's own opinion. They get excited and scream,
and I suggest the garden. Robin says that he is hungry, having had no lunch.
Practically&mdash;he adds conscientiously. "Practically" turns out to be packet of
sandwiches, two bottles of atrocious liquid called Cherry Ciderette, slab of
milk chocolate, two bananas purchased on journey, and small sample tin of
cheese biscuits, swopped by boy called Sherlock, for Robin's last year's copy
of <i>Pop's Annual</i>.</p>

<p><a name="0800661h-20" id="0800661h-20"></a><img alt="" src=
"0800661h-images/0800661h-20.jpg"></p>
</center>
<p>Customary rather touching display of affection between Robin and Vicky much
to the fore, and am sorry to feel that repeated experience of holidays has
taught me not to count for one moment upon its lasting more than twenty-four
hours&mdash;if that.</p>
<p>(Query: Does motherhood lead to cynicism? This contrary to every convention
of art, literature, or morality, but cannot altogether escape conviction that
answer may be in the affirmative.)</p>
<p>In spite of this, however, cannot remain quite unmoved on hearing Vicky
inform Cook that when she marries, her husband will be <i>exactly</i> like
Robin. Cook replies indulgently, That's right, but come out of that sauce-boat,
there's a good girl, and what about Master Robin's wife? To which Robin
rejoins, he doesn't suppose he'll be <i>able</i> to get a wife exactly like
Vicky, as she's so good, there couldn't be another one.</p>
<p><i>August 2nd.</i>&mdash;Noteworthy what astonishing difference made in entire
household by presence of one additional child. Robert finds one marble&mdash;which
he unfortunately steps upon&mdash;mysterious little empty box with hole in bottom,
and half of torn sponge on the stairs, and says, This house is a perfect
Shambles&mdash;which I think excessive. Mademoiselle refers to sounds emitted by
Robin, Vicky, the dog, and Helen Wills&mdash;all, apparently, gone mad together in
the hay-loft&mdash;as "tohu-bohu". Very expressive word.</p>
<p>Meal-times, especially lunch, very, very far from peaceful. From time to
time remember, with pained astonishment, theories subscribed to in
pre-motherhood days, as to inadvisability of continually saying Don't,
incessant fault-finding, and so on. Should now be sorry indeed to count number
of times that I find myself forced to administer these and similar checks to
the dear children. Am often reminded of enthusiastic accounts given me by
Angela of other families, and admirable discipline obtaining there without
effort on either side. Should like&mdash;or far more probably should <i>not</i>
like&mdash;to hear what dear Angela says about <i>our</i> house, when visiting
mutual friends or relations.</p>
<p>Rose writes cheerfully, still in South of France&mdash;sky still blue, rocks red,
and bathing as perfect as ever. Experience curious illusion of receiving
communication from another world, visited many aeons ago, and dimly remembered.
Weather abominable, and customary difficulty experienced of finding indoor
occupation for children that shall be varied, engrossing, and reasonably quiet.
Cannot imagine what will happen if these conditions still prevail when visiting
school-fellow&mdash;Henry by name&mdash;arrives. I ask Robin what his friend's tastes
are, and he says, Oh, anything. I enquire if he likes cricket, and Robin
replies, Yes, he expects so. Does he care for reading? Robin says that he does
not know. I give it up, and write to Army and Navy Stores for large tin of
Picnic Biscuits.</p>
<p>Messrs. R. Sydenham, and two unknown firms from places in Holland, send me
little books relating to indoor bulbs. R. Sydenham particularly optimistic,
and, though admitting that failures have been known, pointing out that all,
without exception, have been owing to neglect of directions on page twenty-two.
Immerse myself in page twenty-two, and see that there is nothing for it but to
get R. Sydenham's Special Mixture for growing R. Sydenham's Special Bulbs.</p>
<p>Mention this to Robert, who does not encourage scheme in any way, and refers
to last November. Cannot at the moment think of really good answer, but shall
probably do so in church on Sunday, or in other surroundings equally
inappropriate for delivering it.</p>
<p><i>August 3rd.</i>&mdash;Difference of opinion arises between Robin and his
father as to the nature and venue of former's evening meal, Robin making
sweeping assertions to the effect that All Boys of his Age have Proper Late
Dinner downstairs, and Robert replying curtly More Fools their Parents, which I
privately think unsuitable language for use before children. Final and
unsatisfactory compromise results in Robin's coming nightly to the dining-room
and partaking of soup, followed by interval, and ending with dessert, during
the whole of which Robert maintains disapproving silence and I talk to both at
once on entirely different subjects.</p>
<p>(Life of a wife and mother sometimes very wearing.)</p>
<p>Moreover, Vicky offended at not being included in what she evidently looks
upon as nightly banquet of Lucullan magnificence, and covertly supported in
this rebellious attitude by Mademoiselle. Am quite struck by extraordinary
persistence with which Vicky, day after day, enquires <i>Why</i> she can't stay
up to dinner too? and equally phenomenal number of times that I reply with
unvarying formula that Six years old is too young, darling.</p>
<p>Weather cold and disagreeable, and I complain. Robert asserts that it is
really quite warm, only I don't take enough exercise. Have often noticed
curious and prevalent masculine delusion, to the effect that sympathy should
never, on any account, be offered when minor ills of life are in question.</p>
<p>Days punctuated by recurrent question as to whether grass is, or is not, too
wet to be sat upon by children, and whether they shall, or shall not, wear
their woollen pullovers. To all enquiries as to whether they are cold, they
invariably reply, with aggrieved expressions, that they are <i>Boiling</i>.
Should like scientific or psychological explanation of this singular state of
affairs, and mentally reserve the question for bringing forward on next
occasion of finding myself in intellectual society. This, however, seems at the
moment remote in the extreme.</p>
<p>Cook says that unless help is provided in the kitchen they cannot possibly
manage all the work. I think this unreasonable, and quite unnecessary expense.
Am also aware that there is no help to be obtained at this time of the year. Am
disgusted at hearing myself reply in hypocritically pleasant tone of voice
that, Very well, I will see what can be done. Servants, in truth, make cowards
of us all.</p>
<p><i>August 7th.</i>&mdash;Local Flower Show takes place. We walk about in
Burberrys, on wet grass, and say that it might have been much worse, and look
at the day they had last week at West Warmington! Am forcibly reminded of what
I have heard of Ruth Draper's admirable sketch of country Bazaar, but try hard
not to think about this. Our Vicar's wife takes me to look at the
school-children's needlework, laid out in tent amidst onions, begonias, and
other vegetable products. Just as I am admiring pink cotton camisole
embroidered with mauve pansies, strange boy approaches me and says, If I
please, the little girl isn't very well, and can't be got out of the
swing-boat, and will I come, please. I go, our Vicar's wife following, and
saying&mdash;absurdly&mdash;that it must be the heat, and those swingboats have always
seemed to her very dangerous, ever since there was a fearful accident at her
old home, when the whole thing broke down, and seven people were killed and a
good many of the spectators injured. A relief, after this, to find Vicky merely
green in the face, still clinging obstinately to the ropes and disregarding two
men below saying Come along out of it, missie, and Now then, my dear, and
Mademoiselle in terrific state of agitation, clasping her hands and pacing
backwards and forwards, uttering many Gallic ejaculations and adjurations to
the saints. Robin has removed himself to furthest corner of the ground, and is
feigning interest in immense carthorse tied up in red ribbons.</p>
<p>(<i>N.B.</i> Dear Robin perhaps not so utterly unlike his father as one is
sometimes tempted to suppose.)</p>
<p>I tell Vicky, very, very shortly, that unless she descends instantly, she
will go to bed early every night for a week. Unfortunately, tremendous outburst
of "Land of Hope and Glory" from brass band compels me to say this in
undignified bellow, and to repeat it three times before it has any effect, by
which time quite large crowd has gathered round. General outburst of applause
when at last swing-boat is brought to a standstill, and Vicky&mdash;mottled to the
last degree&mdash;is lifted out by man in check coat and tweed cap, who says
<i>Here</i> we are, Amy Johnson! to fresh applause.</p>
<p>Vicky removed by Mademoiselle, not a moment too soon. Our Vicar's wife says
that children are all alike, and it may be a touch of ptomaine poisoning, one
never knows, and why not come and help her judge decorated perambulators?</p>
<p>Meet several acquaintances and newly-arrived Miss Pankerton, who has bought
small house in village, and on whom I have not yet called. She wears pince-nez
and is said to have been at Oxford. All I can get out of her is that the whole
thing reminds her of Dostoeffsky.</p>
<p>Feel that I neither know nor care what she means. Am convinced, however,
that I have not heard the last of either Miss P. or Dostoeffsky, as she assures
me that she is the most unconventional person in the whole world, and never
stands on ceremony. If she meets an affinity, she adds, she knows it directly,
and then nothing can stop her. She just follows the impulse of the moment, and
may as like as not stroll in for breakfast, or be strolled in upon for
after-dinner coffee.</p>
<p>Am quite unable to contemplate Robert's reaction to Miss P. and Dostoeffsky
at breakfast, and bring the conversation to an end as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Find Robert, our Vicar, and neighbouring squire, looking at horses. Our
Vicar and neighbouring squire talk about the weather, but do not say anything
new. Robert says nothing.</p>
<p>Get home towards eight o'clock, strangely exhausted, and am discouraged at
meeting both maids just on their way to the Flower-Show Dance. Cook says
encouragingly that the potatoes are in the oven, and everything else on the
table, and she only hopes Pussy hasn't found her way in, on account of the
butter. Eventually do the washing-up, while Mademoiselle puts children to bed,
and I afterwards go up and read <i>Tanglewood Tales</i> aloud.</p>
<p>(Query, mainly rhetorical: Why are nonprofessional women, if married and
with children, so frequently referred to as "leisured"? Answer comes there
none.)</p>

<p><i>August 8th.</i>&mdash;Frightful afternoon, entirely filled by call from Miss
Pankerton, wearing hand-woven blue jumper, wider in front than at the back,
very short skirt, and wholly incredible small black b&eacute;ret. She smokes
cigarettes in immense holder, and sits astride the arm of the sofa.</p>
<p>(<i>N.B.</i> Arm of the sofa not at all calculated to bear any such strain,
and creaks several times most alarmingly. Must remember to see if anything can
be done about it, and in any case manoeuvre Miss P. into sitting elsewhere on
subsequent visits, if any.)</p>
<p>Conversation very, very literary and academic, my own part in it being
mostly confined to saying that I haven't yet read it, and, It's down on my
library list, but hasn't come, so far. After what feels like some hours of
this, Miss P. becomes personal, and says that I strike her as being a woman
whose life has never known fulfilment. Have often thought exactly the same
thing myself, but this does not prevent my feeling entirely furious with Miss
P. for saying so. She either does not perceive, or is indifferent to, my fury,
as she goes on to ask accusingly whether I realise that I have no <i>right</i>
to let myself become a domestic beast of burden, with no interests beyond the
nursery and the kitchen. What, for instance, she demands rousingly, have I read
within the last two years? To this I reply weakly that I have read <i>Gentlemen
Prefer Blondes</i>, which is the only thing I seem able to remember, when
Robert and the tea enter simultaneously. Curious and difficult interlude
follows, in the course of which Miss P. talks about the N.U.E.C.&mdash;(Cannot
imagine what this is, but pretend to know all about it)&mdash;and the situation in
India, and Robert either says nothing at all, or contradicts her very briefly
and forcibly. Miss P. finally departs, saying that she is determined to scrape
all the barnacles off me before she has done with me, and that I shall soon be
seeing her again.</p>
<p><i>August 9th.</i>&mdash;The child Henry deposited by expensive-looking parents
in enormous red car, who dash away immediately, after one contemptuous look at
house, garden, self, and children. (Can understand this, in a way, as they
arrive sooner than expected, and Robin, Vicky, and I are all equally untidy
owing to prolonged game of Wild Beasts in the garden.)</p>
<p>Henry unspeakably immaculate in grey flannel and red tie&mdash;but all is
discarded when parents have departed, and he rapidly assumes disreputable
appearance and loud, screeching tones of complete at-homeness. Robert, for
reasons unknown, appears unable to remember his name, and calls him Francis.
(Should like to trace connection of ideas, if any, but am baffled.)</p>
<p>Both boys come down to dinner, and Henry astonishes us by pouring out steady
stream of information concerning speedboats, aeroplanes, and submarines, from
start to finish. Most informative. Am quite relieved, after boys have gone to
bed, to find him looking infantile in blue-striped pyjamas, and asking to have
door left open so that he can see light in passage outside.</p>
<p>I go down to Robert and ask&mdash;not very straightforwardly, since I know the
answer only too well&mdash;if he would not like to take Mademoiselle, me, and the
children to spend long day at the sea next week. We might invite one or two
people to join us and have a picnic, say I with false optimism. Robert looks
horrified and says, Surely that isn't necessary? but after some discussion,
yields, on condition that weather is favourable.</p>
<p>(Should not be surprised to learn that he has been praying for rain ever
since.)</p>
<p><i>August 10th.</i>&mdash;See Miss Pankerton through Post Office window and have
serious thoughts of asking if I may just get under the counter for a moment, or
retire into back premises altogether, but am restrained by presence of
children, and also interesting story, embarked upon by Postmistress, concerning
extraordinary decision of Bench, last Monday week, as to Separation Order
applied for by Mrs. W. of the <i>Queen's Head</i>. Just as we get to its being
well known that Mr. W. once threw hand-painted plate with view of Teignmouth
right across the bedroom&mdash;absolutely right across it, from end to end, says
Postmistress impressively&mdash;we are invaded by Miss P., accompanied by two
sheep-dogs and some leggy little boys.</p>
<p>Little boys turn out to be nephews, paying a visit, and are told to go and
make friends with Robin, Henry, and Vicky&mdash;at which all exchange looks of
blackest hatred, with regrettable exception of Vicky, who smirks at the tallest
nephew, who takes no notice. Miss P. pounces on Henry and says to me Is this my
boy, his eyes are so exactly like mine she'd have known him anywhere. Nobody
contradicts her, although I do not feel pleased, as Henry, in my opinion,
entirely undistinguished-looking child.</p>
<p>Postmistress&mdash;perhaps diplomatically&mdash;intervenes with, Did I say a
two-shilling book, she has them, but I usually take the three-shilling, if I'll
excuse her. I do excuse her, and explain that I only have two shillings with
me, and she says that doesn't matter at all and Harold will take the other
shilling when he calls for the letters. I agree to all, and turn cast-iron
deafness to Miss P. in background exclaiming that this is Pure Hardy.</p>
<p>We all surge out of Post Office together, and youngest Pankerton nephew
suddenly remarks that at <i>his</i> home the water once came through the
bathroom floor into the dining-room. Vicky says Oh, and all then become silent
again until Miss P. tells another nephew not to twist the sheep-dog's tail like
that, and the nephew, looking astonished, says in return, Why not? to which
Miss P. rejoins, Noel, that will <i>Do</i>.</p>
<p><i>Mem</i>.: Amenities of conversation sometimes very curious, especially
where society of children is involved. Have sometimes wondered at what stage of
development the idea of continuity in talk begins to seem desirable&mdash;but here,
again, disquieting reflection follows that perhaps this stage is never reached
at all. Debate for an instant whether to put the point to Miss Pankerton, but
decide better not, and in any case, she turns out to be talking about H. G.
Wells, and do not like to interrupt. Just as she is telling me that it is quite
absurd to compare Wells with Shaw&mdash;(which I have never thought of doing)&mdash;a
Pankerton nephew and Henry begin to kick one another on the shins, and have to
be told that that is Quite Enough. The Pankerton nephew is agitated and says,
Tell him my name <i>isn't</i> Noah, it's Noel. This misunderstanding cleared
up, but the nephew remains Noah to his contemporaries, and is evidently
destined to do so for years to come, and Henry receives much applause as
originator of brilliant witticism.</p>
<p>Do not feel that Miss P. views any of it as being in the least amusing, and
in order to create a diversion, rush into an invitation to them all to join
projected picnic to the sea next week.</p>
<p>(Query: Would it not be instructive to examine closely exact motives
governing suggestions and invitations that bear outward appearance of
spontaneity? Answer: Instructive undoubtedly, but probably in many cases
painful, and&mdash;on second thoughts&mdash;shall embark on no such exercise.)</p>
<p>We part with Pankertons at the crossroads, but not before Miss P. has
accepted invitation to picnic, and added that her brother will be staying with
her then, and a dear friend who Writes, and that she hopes that will not be too
large a party. I say No, not at all, and feel that this settles the question of
buying another half-dozen picnic plates and enamel mugs, and better throw in a
new Thermos as well, otherwise not a hope of things going round. That, says
Miss P., will be delightful, and shall they bring their own sandwiches?&mdash;at
which I exclaim in horror, and she says Really? and I say Really, with equal
emphasis but quite different inflection, and we part.</p>
<p>Robin says he does not know why I asked them to the picnic, and I stifle
impulse to reply that neither do I, and Henry tells me all about hydraulic
lifts.</p>
<p>Send children upstairs to wash for lunch, and call out several times that
they must hurry up or they will be late, but am annoyed when gong, eventually,
is sounded by Gladys nearly ten minutes after appointed hour. Cannot decide
whether I shall, or shall not, speak about this, and am preoccupied all through
roast lamb and mint sauce, but forget about it when fruit-salad is reached, as
Cook has disastrously omitted banana and put in loganberries.</p>
<p><i>August 13th.</i>&mdash;I tell Cook about the picnic lunch&mdash;for about ten
people, say I&mdash;which sounds less than if I just said "ten" straight out&mdash;but
she is not taken in by this, and at once declares that there isn't anything to
make sandwiches of, that she can see, and butcher won't be calling till the day
after tomorrow, and then it'll be scrag-end for Irish stew. I perceive that the
moment has come for taking up absolutely firm stand with Cook, and surprise us
both by suddenly saying Nonsense, she must order chicken from farm, and have it
cold for sandwiches. It won't go round, Cook protests&mdash;but feebly&mdash;and I pursue
advantage and advocate supplementary potted meat and hard-boiled eggs. Cook
utterly vanquished, and I leave kitchen triumphant, but am met in the passage
outside by Vicky, who asks in clarion tones (easily audible in kitchen and
beyond) if I know that I threw cigarette-end into drawing-room grate, and that
it has lit the fire all by itself?</p>
<p><i>August 15th.</i>&mdash;Picnic takes place under singular and rather disastrous
conditions, day not beginning well owing to Robin and Henry having strange
overnight inspiration about sleeping out in summer-house, which is prepared for
them with much elaboration by Mademoiselle and myself&mdash;even to crowning touch
from Mademoiselle of small vase of flowers on table. At 2 A.M. they decide that
they wish to come in, and do so through study window left open for them. Henry
involves himself in several blankets, which he tries to carry upstairs, and
trips and falls down, and Robin knocks over hall-stool, and treads on Helen
Wills.</p>
<p>Robert and myself are roused, and Robert is not pleased. Mademoiselle
appears on landing in <i>peignoir</i> and with head swathed in little grey
shawl, but screams at the sight of Robert in pyjamas, and rushes away again.
(The French undoubtedly very curious mixture of modesty and the reverse.)</p>
<p>Henry and Robin show tendency to become explanatory, but are discouraged,
and put into beds. Just as I return down passage to my room, sounds indicate
that Vicky has now awakened, and is automatically opening campaign by saying
Can't I come too? Instinct&mdash;unclassified, but evidently stronger than maternal
one&mdash;bids me leave Mademoiselle to deal with this, which I unhesitatingly
do.</p>
<center>
<p><a name="0800661h-22" id="0800661h-22"></a><img alt="" src=
"0800661h-images/0800661h-22.jpg"></p>
</center>
<p>Get into bed again, feeling that the day has not opened very well, but sleep
off and on until Gladys calls me&mdash;ten minutes late&mdash;but do not say anything
about her unpunctuality, as Robert does not appear to have noticed it.</p>
<p>Sky is grey, but not necessarily threatening, and glass has not fallen
unreasonably. All is in readiness when Miss Pankerton (wearing Burberry, green
knitted cap, and immense yellow gloves) appears in large Ford car which brims
over with nephews, sheep-dogs, and a couple of men. Latter resolve themselves
into the Pankerton brother&mdash;who turns out to be from Vancouver&mdash;and the friend
who Writes&mdash;very tall and pale, and is addressed by Miss P. in a proprietary
manner as "Jahsper".</p>
<p>(Something tells me that Robert and Jahsper are not going to care about one
another.)</p>
<p>After customary preliminaries about weather, much time is spent in
discussing arrangements in cars. All the children show tendency to wish to sit
with their own relations rather than anybody else, except Henry, who says
simply that the hired car looks much the best, and may he sit in front with the
driver, please. All is greatly complicated by presence of the sheep-dogs, and
Robert offers to shut them into an outhouse for the day, but Miss Pankerton
replies that this would break their hearts, bless them, and they can just pop
down anywhere amongst the baskets. (In actual fact, both eventually pop down on
Mademoiselle's feet, and she looks despairing, and presently ask if I have by
any chance a little bottle of eau-de-Cologne with me&mdash;which I naturally
haven't.)</p>
<p>Picnic baskets, as usual, weigh incredible amount, and Thermos flasks stick
up at inconvenient angles and run into our legs. (I quote "John Gilpin", rather
aptly, but nobody pays any attention.)</p>
<p>When we have driven about ten miles, rain begins, and goes on and on. Cars
are stopped, and we find that two schools of thought exist, one&mdash;of which Miss
P. is leader&mdash;declaring that we are Running out of It, and the other&mdash;headed by
the Vancouver brother and heavily backed by Robert&mdash;that we are Running into
It. Miss P.&mdash;as might have been expected&mdash;wins, and we proceed; but Run into It
more and more. By the time destination is reached, we have Run into It to an
extent that makes me wonder if we shall ever Run out of It.</p>
<p>Lunch has to be eaten in three bathing huts, hired by Robert, and the
children become hilarious and fidgety. Miss P. talks about Companionate
Marriage to Robert, who makes no answer, and Jahsper asks me what I think of
James Elroy Flecker. As I cannot remember exact form of J. E. F.'s activities,
I merely reply that in many ways he was very wonderful&mdash;which no doubt he
was&mdash;and Jahsper seems satisfied, and eats tomato sandwiches. The children ask
riddles&mdash;mostly very old and foolish ones&mdash;and Miss P. looks annoyed, and says
See if it has stopped raining&mdash;which it hasn't. I feel that she and the
children must, at all costs, be kept apart, and tell Robert in urgent whisper
that, rain or no rain, they must go out.</p>
<p>They do.</p>
<p>Miss Pankerton becomes expansive, and suddenly remarks to Jahsper that
<i>Now</i> he can see what she meant, about positively Victorian survivals
still to be found in English family life. At this, Vancouver brother looks
aghast&mdash;as well he may&mdash;and dashes out into the wet. Jahsper says Yerse, Yerse,
and sighs, and I at once institute vigorous search for missing plate, which
creates a diversion.</p>
<p>Subsequently the children bathe, get wetter than ever, drip all over the
place, and are dried&mdash;Mademoiselle predicts death from pneumonia for all&mdash;and
we seek the cars once more. One sheep-dog is missing, but eventually recovered
in soaking condition, and is gathered on to united laps of Vicky, Henry, and a
nephew. I lack energy to protest, and we drive away.</p>
<p>Beg Miss P., Jahsper, brother, nephews, sheep-dogs, and all, to come in and
get dry and have tea, but they have the decency to refuse, and I make no
further effort, but watch them depart with untold thankfulness.</p>
<p>(Should be sorry to think impulses of hospitality almost entirely dependent
on convenience, but cannot altogether escape suspicion that this is so.)</p>
<p>Robert extremely forbearing on the whole, and says nothing worse than
Well!&mdash;but this very expressively.</p>
<p><i>August 16th.</i>&mdash;Robert, at breakfast, suddenly enquires if that
nasty-looking fellow does anything for a living? Instinct at once tells me that
he means Jahsper, but am unable to give him any information, except that
Jahsper writes, which Robert does not appear to think is to his credit. He goes
so far as to say that he hopes yesterday's rain may put an end to him
altogether&mdash;but whether this means to his presence in the neighbourhood, or to
his existence on this planet, am by no means certain, and prefer not to
enquire. Ask Robert instead if he did not think, yesterday, about Miss
Edgeworth, Rosamond, and the Party of Pleasure, but this wakens no response,
and conversation&mdash;such as it is&mdash;descends once more to level of slight
bitterness about the coffee, and utter inability to get really satisfactory
bacon locally. This is only brought to a close by abrupt entrance of Robin, who
remarks without preliminary: "Isn't Helen Wills going to have kittens almost at
once? Cook thinks so."</p>
<p>Can only hope that Robin does not catch exact wording of short ejaculation
with which his father receives this.</p>
<p><i>August 18th.</i>&mdash;Pouring rain, and I agree to let all three children
dress up, and give them handsome selection from my wardrobe for the purpose.
This ensures me brief half-hour uninterrupted at writing-table, where I deal
with baker&mdash;brown bread far from satisfactory&mdash;Rose&mdash;on a picture-postcard of
Backs at Cambridge, which mysteriously appears amongst stationery&mdash;Robin's
Headmaster's wife&mdash;mostly about stockings, but Boxing may be substituted for
Dancing, in future&mdash;and Lady Frobisher, who would be so delighted if Robert and
I would come over for tea whilst there is still something to be seen in the
garden. (Do not like to write back and say that I would far rather come when
there is nothing to be seen in the garden, and we might enjoy excellent tea in
peace&mdash;so, as usual, sacrifice truth to demands of civilisation.)</p>
<p>Just as I decide to tackle large square envelope of thin blue paper, with
curious purple lining designed to defeat anyone endeavouring to read letter
within&mdash;which would anyhow be impossible, as Barbara Carruthers always most
illegible&mdash;front door bell rings.</p>
<p>Thoughts immediately fly to Lady B., and I rapidly rehearse references that
I intend to make to recent stay in South of France&mdash;(shall not specify length
of visit)&mdash;and cordial relations there established with distinguished society,
and Rose's Viscountess in particular. Have also sufficient presence of mind to
make use of pocket comb, mirror, and small powder-puff kept for emergencies in
drawer of writing-table. (Discover, much later, that I have overdone
powder-puff very considerably, and reflect, not for the first time, that we are
spared much by inability&mdash;so misguidedly deplored by Scottish poet&mdash;to see
ourselves as others see us.)</p>
<p>Door opens, and Miss Pankerton is shown in, followed&mdash;it seems to me
reluctantly&mdash;by Jahsper. Miss P. has on military-looking cape, and b&eacute;ret
as before, which strikes me as odd combination, and anyhow cape looks to me as
though it might drip rain-drops on furniture, and I beg her to take it off.
This she does with rather spacious gesture&mdash;(Can she have been seeing <i>The
Three Musketeers</i> at local cinema?)&mdash;and unfortunately one end of it,
apparently heavily weighted, hits Jahsper in the eye. Miss P. is very breezy
and off-hand about this, but Jahsper, evidently in severe pain, falls into deep
dejection, and continues to hold large yellow cr&ecirc;pe-de-chine handkerchief
to injured eye for some time. Am distracted by wondering whether I ought to ask
him if he would like to bathe it&mdash;which would involve taking him up to
bathroom, probably untidy&mdash;and trying to listen intelligently to Miss P., who
is talking about Proust.</p>
<p>This leads, by process that I do not follow, to a discussion on Christian
names, and Miss P. says that All Flower Names are Absurd. Am horrified to hear
myself replying, senselessly, that I think Rose is a pretty name, as one of my
greatest friends is called Rose&mdash;to which Miss P. rightly answers that that,
really, has nothing to do with it, and Jahsper, still dabbing at injured eye,
contributes austere statement to the effect that only the Russians really
understand Beauty in Nomenclature. Am again horrified at hearing myself
interject "<i>Ivan Ivanovitch</i>" in entirely detached and irrelevant manner,
and really begin to wonder if mental weakness is overtaking me. Moreover, am
certain that I have given Miss P. direct lead in the direction of Dostoeffsky,
about whom I do not wish to hear, and am altogether unable to converse.</p>
<p>Entire situation is, however, revolutionised by totally unexpected entrance
of Robin&mdash;staggering beneath my fur coat and last summer's red crinoline straw
hat&mdash;Henry, draped in blue kimono, several scarfs belonging to Mademoiselle,
old pair of fur gloves, with scarlet school-cap inappropriately crowning
all&mdash;and Vicky, wearing nothing whatever but small pair of green silk
knickerbockers and large and unfamiliar black felt hat put on at rakish
angle.</p>
<p>Completely stunned silence overtakes us all, until Vicky, advancing with
perfect aplomb, graciously says, "How do you do?" and shakes hands with Jahsper
and Miss P. in turn, and I succeed in surpassing already well-established
record for utter futility, by remarking that They have been Dressing Up.</p>
<p>Atmosphere becomes very, very strained indeed, only Vicky embarking on
sprightly reminiscences of recent picnic, which meet with no response. Final
depths of unsuccess are plumbed, when it transpires that Vicky's black
sombrero, picked up in the hall, is in reality the property of Jahsper. I
apologise profusely, the children giggle, Miss P. raises her eyebrows to quite
unnatural heights, and gets up and looks at the book-shelves in a remote and
superior way, and Jahsper says, Oh, never mind, it really is of no consequence,
at the same time receiving hat with profound solicitude, and dusting it with
two fingers.</p>
<p>Greatest possible relief when Miss P. declares that they must go, otherwise
they will miss the Brahms Concerto on the wireless. I hastily agree that this
would never do, and tell Robin to open the door. Just as we all cross the hall,
Gladys is inspired to sound the gong for tea, and I am compelled to say, Won't
they stay and have some? but Miss P. says she never takes anything at all
between lunch and dinner, thanks, and Jahsper pretends he hasn't heard me and
makes no reply whatever.</p>
<p>They march out into pouring rain, Miss P. once more giving martial fling to
military cape&mdash;(at which Jahsper flinches, and removes himself some yards away
from her)&mdash;and entirely disdaining small and elegant umbrella beneath which
Jahsper and his black felt take refuge. Robin enquires, in tones of marked
distaste, if I <i>like</i> those people? but I feel it better to ignore this,
and recommend getting washed for tea. Customary discussion follows as to
whether washing is, or is not, necessary.</p>
<p>(<i>Mem</i>.: Have sometimes considered&mdash;though idly&mdash;writing letter to the
<i>Times</i> to find out if any recorded instances exist of parents and
children whose views on this subject coincide. Topic of far wider appeal than
many of those so exhaustively dealt with.)</p>
<p><i>August 25th.</i>&mdash;Am displeased by Messrs. R. Sydenham, who have besought
me, in urgently worded little booklet, to Order Bulbs Early, and when I do
so&mdash;at no little inconvenience, owing to customary pressure of holidays&mdash;reply
on a postcard that order will be forwarded "when ready". Have serious thoughts
of cancelling the whole thing&mdash;six selected, twelve paper-whites, a dozen early
assorteds, and a half bushel of Fibre, Moss, and Charcoal. Cannot very well do
this, however, owing to quite recent purchase of coloured bowls from
Woolworth's, as being desirable additions to existing collection of odd pots,
dented enamel basins, large red glass jam-dish, and dear grandmamma's disused
willow-pattern foot-bath.</p>
<p>Departure of the boy Henry&mdash;who says that he has enjoyed himself, which I
hope is true&mdash;accompanied by Robin, who is to be met and extracted from train
at Salisbury by uncle of boy with whom he is to stay.</p>
<p>(Query: How is it that others are so frequently able to obtain services of
this nature from their relations? Feel no conviction that either William or
Angela would react favourably, if called upon to meet unknown children at
Salisbury or anywhere else.)</p>
<p>Vicky, Mademoiselle, and I wave goodbye from hall door&mdash;rain pouring down as
usual&mdash;and Vicky seems a thought depressed at remaining behind. This tendency
greatly enhanced by Mademoiselle's exclamation, on retiring into the house once
more&mdash;"On dirait un tombeau!"</p>
<p>Second post brings letter from Barbara in the Himalayas, which gives me
severe shock of realising that I haven't yet read her last one, owing to lack
of time and general impression that it is illegibly scrawled and full of
allusions to native servants. Remorsefully open this one, perceive with relief
that it is quite short and contains nothing that looks like native servants,
but very interesting piece of information, rather circuitously worded by dear
Barbara, but still quite beyond misunderstanding. I tell Mademoiselle, who says
"Ah, comme c'est touchant!" and at once wipes her eyes&mdash;display which I think
excessive.</p>
<p>Robert, to whom I also impart news, goes to the other extreme, and makes no
comment except "I daresay". On the other hand, our Vicar's wife calls, for the
express purpose of asking whether I think it will be a boy or a girl, and of
suggesting that we should at once go together and congratulate old Mrs.
Blenkinsop. I remind her that Barbara stipulates in letter for secrecy, and our
Vicar's wife says, Of course, of course&mdash;it had slipped her memory for the
moment&mdash;but surely old Mrs. B. must know all about it? However, she concedes
that dear Barbara may perhaps not wish her mother to know that we know, just
yet, and concludes with involved quotation from Thomas a Kempis about exercise
of discretion. We then discuss educational facilities in the Himalayas, the
Carruthers nose&mdash;which neither of us cares about&mdash;and the desirability or
otherwise of having twins. Our Vicar's wife refuses tea, talks about books&mdash;she
likes to have something <i>solid</i> in hand, always&mdash;is reminded of Miss
Pinkerton, about whom she is doubtful, but admits that it is early days to
judge&mdash;again refuses tea, and assures me that she must go. She eventually stays
to tea, and walks up and down the lawn with me afterwards, telling me of Lady
B.'s outrageous behaviour in connection with purchase of proposed site for the
Village Hall. This, as usual, serves to unite us in warm friendship, and we
part cordially.</p>
<p><i>August 28th.</i>&mdash;Picnic, and Cook forgets to put in the sugar. Postcard
from Robin's hostess says that he has arrived, but adds nothing as to his
behaviour, or impression that he is making, which makes me feel anxious.</p>
<p><i>August 31st.</i>&mdash;Read <i>The Edwardians</i> which everybody else has
read months ago&mdash;and am delighted and amused. Remember that V. Sackville-West
and I once attended dancing classes together at the Albert Hall, many years
ago, but feel that if I do mention this, everybody will think I am
boasting&mdash;which indeed I should be&mdash;so better forget about it again, and in any
case, dancing never my strongest point, and performance at Albert Hall
extremely mediocre and may well be left in oblivion. Short letter from Robin
which I am very glad to get, but which refers to nothing whatever except
animals at home, and project for going out in a boat and diving from it on some
unspecified future occasion. Reply to all, and am too modern to beg tiresomely
for information concerning himself.</p>
<p><i>September 1st.</i>&mdash;Postcard from the station announces arrival of
parcel, that I at once identify as bulbs, with accompanying Fibre, Moss, and
Charcoal mixture. Suggest that Robert should fetch them this afternoon, but he
is unenthusiastic, and says tomorrow, when he will be meeting Robin and
school-friend, will do quite well.</p>
<p>(<i>Mem</i>.: Very marked difference between the sexes is male tendency to
procrastinate doing practically everything in the world except sitting down to
meals and going up to bed. Should like to purchase little painted motto: <i>Do
it now</i>, so often on sale at inferior stationers' shops, and present it to
Robert, but on second thoughts quite see that this would not conduce to
domestic harmony, and abandon scheme at once.)</p>
<p>Think seriously about bulbs, and spread sheets of newspaper on attic floor
to receive them and bowls. Resolve also to keep careful record of all
operations, with eventual results, for future guidance. Look out notebook for
the purpose, and find small green booklet, with mysterious references of which
I can make neither head nor tail, in own handwriting on two first pages. Spend
some time in trying to decide what I could have meant by: Kp. p. in sh. twice
p. w. <i>without</i> fail or: Tell H. <i>not</i> 12" by 8" Washable f.c. to be
g'd, but eventually give it up, and tear out two first pages of little green
book, and write BULBS and to-morrow's date in capital letters.</p>
<p><i>September 2nd.</i>&mdash;Robert brings home Robin, and friend called Micky
Thompson, from station, but has unfortunately forgotten to call for the bulbs.
Micky Thompson is attractive and shows enchanting dimple whenever he smiles,
which is often.</p>
<p>(<i>Mem</i>.: Theory that mothers think their own children superior to any
others Absolute Nonsense. Can see only too plainly that Micky easily surpasses
Robin and Vicky in looks, charm, and good manners&mdash;and am very much annoyed
about it.)</p>
<p><i>September 4th.</i>&mdash;Micky Thompson continues to show himself as charming
child, with cheerful disposition, good manners, and excellent health. Enquiry
reveals that he is an orphan, which does not surprise me in the least. Have
often noticed that absence of parental solicitude usually very beneficial to
offspring. Bulbs still at station.</p>
<p><i>September 10th.</i>&mdash;Unbroken succession of picnics, bathing expeditions,
and drives to Plymouth Cafe in search of ices. Mademoiselle continually
predicts catastrophes to digestions, lungs, or even brains&mdash;but none
materialise.</p>
<p><i>September 11th.</i>&mdash;Departure of Micky Thompson, but am less concerned
with this than with Robert's return from station, this time accompanied by
bulbs and half-bushel of Fibre, Moss, and Charcoal. Devote entire afternoon to
planting these, with much advice from Vicky and Robin, and enter full details
of transaction in little green book. Prepare to carry all, with utmost care,
into furthest and darkest recess of attic, when Vicky suddenly announces that
Helen Wills is there already, with six bran-new kittens.</p>
<p>Great excitement follows, which I am obliged to suggest had better be
modified before Daddy enquires into its cause. Children agree to this, but feel
very little confidence in their discretion. Am obliged to leave bulbs in
secondary corner of attic, owing to humane scruples about disturbing H. Wills
and family.</p>
<p><i>September 20th.</i>&mdash;Letter from County Secretary of adjoining County,
telling me that she knows how busy I am&mdash;which I'm certain she doesn't&mdash;but
Women's Institutes of Chick, Little March, and Crimpington find themselves in
terrible difficulty owing to uncertainty about next month's speaker. Involved
fragments about son coming, or not coming, home on leave from Patagonia, and
daughter ill&mdash;but not dangerously&mdash;at Bromley, Kent&mdash;follow. President is
away&mdash;(further fragment, about President being obliged to visit aged relative
while aged relative's maid is on holiday)&mdash;and County Secretary does not know
what to do. What she does do, however, is to suggest that I should be prepared
to come and speak at all three Institute meetings, if&mdash;as she rather strangely
puts it&mdash;the worst comes to the worst. Separate half-sheet of paper gives
details about dates, times, and bus between Chick and Little March, leading on
to doctor's sister's two-seater, at cross-roads between Little March and
Crimpington Hill. At Crimpington, County Secretary concludes triumphantly, I
shall be put up for the night by Lady Magdalen Crimp&mdash;always so kind, and such
a friend to the Movement&mdash;at Crimpington Hall. P.S. Travel talks always
popular, but anything I like will be delightful. Chick very keen about Folk
Lore, Little March more on the Handicraft side. <i>But anything I like.</i>
P.P.S. Would I be so kind as to judge Recitation Competition at
Crimpington?</p>
<p>I think this over for some time, and decide to write and say that I will do
it, as Robin will have returned to school next week, and should like to
distract my mind. Tell Mademoiselle casually that I may be going on a short
tour, speaking, and she is suitably impressed. Vicky enquires: "Like a
menagerie, mummie?" which seems to me very extraordinary simile, though
innocently meant. I reply, "No, not in the least like a menagerie," and
Mademoiselle adds, officiously, "More like a mission." Am by no means at one
with her here, but have no time to go further into the subject, as Gladys
summons me to prolonged discussion with the Laundry&mdash;represented by man in
white coat at the back gate&mdash;concerning cotton sheet, said to be one of a pair,
but which has been returned in solitary widowhood. The Laundry has much to say
about this, and presently Cook, gardener, Mademoiselle, Vicky, and unidentified
boy apparently attached to Laundry, have all gathered round. Everyone except
boy supports Gladys by saying "That's right" to everything she asserts, and I
eventually leave them to it. Evidently all takes time, as it is not till forty
minutes later that I see gardener slowly returning to his work, and hear van
driving away.</p>
<p>Go up to attic and inspect bulb-bowls, but nothing to be seen. Cannot decide
whether they require water or not, but think perhaps better be on the safe
side, so give them some. Make note in little green book to this effect, as am
determined to keep full record of entire procedure.</p>
<p><i>September 22nd.</i>&mdash;Invitation from Lady B.&mdash;note delivered by hand,
wait reply&mdash;to Robert and myself to come and dine tonight. Reads more like a
Royal Command, and no suggestion that short notice may be inconvenient. Robert
out, and I act with promptitude and firmness on own responsibility, and reply
that we are already engaged for dinner.</p>
<p>(Query: Will this suggest convivial evening at neighbouring Rectory, or
rissoles and cocoa with old Mrs. Blenkinsop and Cousin Maud? Can conceive of no
other alternatives.)</p>
<p>Telephone rings in a peremptory manner just as I am reading aloud enchanting
book, <i>The Exciting Family</i> by M. D. Hillyard&mdash;(surely occasional
contributor to <i>Time and Tide</i>?)&mdash;and I rush to dining-room to deal with
it. (<i>N.B.</i> Must really overcome foolish and immature tendency to feel
that any telephone-call may be prelude to (a) announcement of a fortune or,
alternatively, (b) news of immense and impressive calamity.)</p>
<p>On snatching up receiver, unmistakable tones of Lady B. are heard&mdash;at once
suggesting perhaps rather ill-natured, but not unjustifiable, comparison with a
pea-hen. What, she enquires, is all this nonsense? Of course we must dine
to-night&mdash;she won't hear of a refusal. Besides, what else can we possibly be
doing, unless it's Meetings, and if so, we can cut them for once.</p>
<p>Am at once invaded by host of improbable inspirations: e.g. that the
Lord-Lieutenant of the County and his wife are dining here informally, or that
Rose's Viscountess is staying with us and refuses either to be left alone or to
be taken to Lady B.'s&mdash;(which I know she would at once suggest)&mdash;or even that,
really, Robert and I have had so many late nights recently that we cannot face
another one&mdash;but do not go so far as to proffer any of them aloud. Am
disgusted, instead, to hear myself saying weakly that Robin goes back to school
day after tomorrow, and we do not like to go out on one of his last few
evenings at home. (This may be true so far as I am concerned, but can imagine
no suggestion less likely to be endorsed by Robert, and trust that he may never
come to hear of it.) In any case, it instantly revives long-standing
determination of Lady B.'s to establish me with reputation for being a Perfect
Mother, and she at once takes advantage of it.</p>
<p>I return to <i>The Exciting Family</i> in a state of great inward fury.</p>
<p><i>September 24th.</i>&mdash;Frightful welter of packing, putting away, and
earnest consultations of School List. Robin gives everybody serious injunctions
about not touching anything <i>whatever</i> in his bedroom&mdash;which looks like
inferior pawnbroking establishment at stocktaking time&mdash;and we all more or less
commit ourselves to leaving it alone till Christmas holidays&mdash;which is
completely out of the question.</p>
<p>He is taken away by Robert in the car, looking forlorn and infantile, and
Vicky roars. I beseech her to desist at once, but am rebuked by Mademoiselle,
who says, "Ah, elle a tant de coeur!" in tone which implies that she cannot say
as much for myself.</p>
<p><i>October 1.</i>&mdash;Tell Robert about proposed short tour to Chick, Little
March, and Crimpington, on behalf of W. Is. He says little, but that little not
very enthusiastic. I spend many hours&mdash;or so it seems&mdash;looking out Notes for
Talks, and trying to remember anecdotes that shall be at once funny and
suitable. (This combination rather unusual.)</p>
<p>Pack small bag, search frantically all over writing-table, bedroom, and
drawing-room for W.I. Badge&mdash;which is at last discovered by Mademoiselle in
remote corner of drawer devoted to stockings&mdash;and take my departure. Robert
drives me to station, and I beg that he will keep an eye on the bulbs whilst I
am away.</p>
<p><i>October 2nd.</i>&mdash;Bus from Chick conveys me to Little March, after
successful meeting last night, at which I discourse on Amateur Theatricals, am
applauded, thanked by President in the chair&mdash;name inaudible&mdash;applauded once
more, and taken home by Assistant Secretary, who is putting me up for the
night. We talk about the Movement&mdash;Annual Meeting at Blackpool perhaps a
mistake, why not Bristol or Plymouth?&mdash;difficulty of thinking out new
Programmes for monthly meetings, and really magnificent performance of Chick at
recent Folk-dancing Rally, at which Institute members called upon to go through
"Gathering Peas-cods" no less than three times&mdash;two of Chick's best performers,
says Assistant Secretary proudly, being grandmothers. I express astonished
admiration, and we go on to Village Halls, Sir Oswald Mosley, and methods of
removing ink-stains from linen. Just as Assistant Secretary&mdash;who is unmarried
and lives in nice little cottage&mdash;has escorted me to charming little bedroom,
she remembers that I am eventually going on to Crimpington, and embarks on
interesting scandal about two members of Institute there, and unaccountable
disappearance of one member's name from Committee. This keeps us up till eleven
o'clock, when she begs me to say nothing whatever about her having mentioned
the affair, which was all told her in strictest confidence, and we part.</p>
<p>Reach Little March, via the bus&mdash;which is old, and rattles&mdash;in time for
lunch. Doctor's sister meets me&mdash;elderly lady with dog&mdash;and talks about
hunting. Meeting takes place at three o'clock, in a delightful Hut, and am
impressed by business-like and efficient atmosphere. Doctor's sister, in the
chair, introduces me&mdash;unluckily my name eludes her at eleventh hour, but I
hastily supply it and she says, "Of course, of course"&mdash;and I launch out into A
Visit to Switzerland. As soon as I have finished, elderly member surges up from
front row and says that this has been particularly interesting to <i>her</i>,
as she once lived in Switzerland for nearly fourteen years and knows every inch
of it from end to end. (My own experience confined to six weeks round and about
Lucerne, ten years ago.)</p>
<p>We drink cups of tea, eat excellent buns, sing several Community Songs, and
Meeting comes to an end. Doctor's sister's two-seater, now altogether
home-like, receives me once again, and I congratulate her on Institute. She
smiles and talks about hunting.</p>
<p>Evening passes off quietly, doctor comes in&mdash;elderly man with two dogs&mdash;he
also talks about hunting, and we all separate for bed at ten o'clock.</p>
<p><i>October 3rd.</i>&mdash;Part early from doctor, sister, dogs, and two-seater,
and proceed by train to Crimpington, as Meeting does not take place till
afternoon, and have no wish to arrive earlier than I need. Curious
cross-country journey with many stops, and one change involving long and
draughty wait that I enliven by cup of Bovril.</p>
<p>Superb car meets me, with superb chauffeur who despises me and my bag at
sight, but is obliged to drive us both to Crimping-ton Hall. Butler receives
me, and I am conducted through immense and chilly hall with stone flags to
equally immense and chilly drawing-room, where he leaves me. Very small fire is
lurking behind steel bars at far end of room, and I make my way to it past
little gilt tables, large chairs, and sofas, cabinets apparently lined with
china cups and lustre tea-pots, and massive writing-tables entirely furnished
with hundreds of photographs in silver frames. Butler suddenly reappears with
the <i>Times</i>, which he hands to me on small salver. Have already read it
from end to end in the train, but feel obliged to open it and begin all over
again. He looks doubtfully at the fire, and I hope he is going to put on more
coal, but instead he goes away, and is presently replaced by Lady Magdalen
Crimp, who is about ninety-five and stone-deaf. She wears black, and large fur
cape&mdash;as well she may. She produces trumpet, and I talk down it, and she smiles
and nods, and has evidently not heard one word&mdash;which is just as well, as none
of them worth hearing. After some time she suggests my room, and we creep along
slowly for about quarter of a mile, till first floor is reached, and vast
bedroom with old-fashioned four-poster in the middle of it. Here she leaves me,
and I wash, from little brass jug of tepid water, and note&mdash;by no means for the
first time&mdash;that the use of powder, when temperature has sunk below a certain
level, merely casts extraordinary azure shade over nose and chin.</p>
<p>Faint hope of finding fire in dining-room is extinguished on entering it,
when I am at once struck by its resemblance to a mausoleum. Lady M. and I sit
down at mahogany circular table, she says Do I mind a Cold Lunch? I shake my
head, as being preferable to screaming "No" down trumpet&mdash;though equally far
from the truth&mdash;and we eat rabbit-cream, coffee-shape, and Marie biscuits.</p>
<p>Conversation spasmodic and unsatisfactory, and I am reduced to looking at
portraits on wall, of gentlemen in wigs and ladies with bosoms, also
objectionable study of dead bird, dripping blood, lying amongst oranges and
other vegetable matter. (Should like to know what dear Rose, with her
appreciation of Art, would say to this.) Later we adjourn to drawing-room&mdash;fire
now a mere ember&mdash;and Lady M. explains that she is not going to the Meeting,
but Vice-President will look after me, and she hopes I shall enjoy Recitation
Competition&mdash;some of our members really very clever, and one in particular, so
amusing in dialect. I nod and smile, and continue to shiver, and presently car
fetches me away to village. Meeting is held in reading-room, which seems to me
perfect paradise of warmth, and I place myself as close as possible to large
oil-stove. Vice-President&mdash;very large and expansive in blue&mdash;conducts
everything successfully, and I deliver homily about What Our Children Read,
which is kindly received. After tea&mdash;delightfully hot, in fact scalds me, but I
welcome it&mdash;Recitation Competition takes place and have to rivet my attention
on successive members, who mount a little platform and declaim in turns. We
begin with not very successful rendering of verses hitherto unknown to me,
entitled "Our Institute", and which turn out to be original composition of
reciter. This followed by "Gunga Din" and very rousing poem about Keeping the
Old Flag Flying. Elderly member then announces "The Mine" and is very dramatic
and impressive, but not wholly intelligible, which I put down to Dialect.
Finally award first place to "The Old Flag", and second to "The Mine", and
present prizes. Am unfortunately inspired to observe that dialect poems are
always so interesting, and it then turns out that "The Mine" wasn't in dialect
at all. However, too late to do anything about it.</p>
<p>Meeting is prolonged, for which I am thankful, but finally can no longer
defer returning to arctic regions of Crimpington Hall. Lady M. and I spend
evening cowering over grate, and exchanging isolated remarks, and many nods and
smiles, across ear-trumpet. Finally I get into enormous four-poster, covered by
very inadequate supply of blankets, and clutching insufficiently heated
hot-water bottle.</p>
<p><i>October 5th.</i>&mdash;Develop really severe cold twenty-four hours after
reaching home. Robert says that all Institutes are probably full of
germs&mdash;which is both unjust and ridiculous.</p>
<p><i>October 13th.</i>&mdash;Continued cold and cough keep me in house, and make me
unpopular with Robert, Cook, and Gladys&mdash;the latter of whom both catch my
complaint. Mademoiselle keeps Vicky away, but is sympathetic, and brings Vicky
to gesticulate dramatically at me from outside the drawing-room window, as
though I had the plague. Gradually this state of affairs subsides, my daily
quota of pocket-handkerchiefs returns to the normal, and Vapex, cinnamon,
camphorated oil, and jar of cold cream all go back to medicine-cupboard in
bathroom once more.</p>
<p>Unknown benefactor sends me copy of new Literary Review, which seems to be
full of personal remarks from well-known writers about other well-known
writers. This perhaps more amusing to themselves than to average reader.
Moreover, competitions most alarmingly literary, and I return with immense
relief to old friend <i>Time and Tide</i>.</p>
<p><i>October 17th.</i>&mdash;Surprising invitation to evening party&mdash;Dancing,
9.30&mdash;at Lady B.'s. Cannot possibly refuse, as Robert has been told to make
himself useful there in various ways; moreover, entire neighbourhood is
evidently being polished off, and see no object in raising question as to
whether we have, or have not, received invitation. Decide to get new dress, but
must have it made locally, owing to rather sharply worded enquiry from London
shop which has the privilege of serving me, as to whether I have not overlooked
overdue portion of account? (Far from overlooking it, have actually been kept
awake by it at night.) Proceed to Plymouth, and get very attractive black
taffeta, with little pink and blue posies scattered over it. Mademoiselle
removes, and washes, Honiton lace from old purple velvet every-night tea-gown,
and assures me that it will be <i>gentil &Atilde;&nbsp;&acirc;&#8364;&#8249; croquer</i> on new taffeta.
Also buy new pair black evening-shoes, but shall wear them every evening for at
least an hour in order to ensure reasonable comfort at party.</p>
<p>Am able to congratulate myself that great-aunt's diamond ring, for once, is
at home when needed.</p>
<p>Robert rather shatteringly remarks that he believes the dancing is only for
the <i>young</i> people, and I heatedly enquire how line of demarcation is to
be laid down? Should certainly not dream of accepting ruling from Lady B. on
any such delicate question. Robert merely repeats that only the young will be
<i>expected</i> to dance, and we drop the subject, and I enquire into nature of
refreshments to be expected at party, as half-past nine seems to me singularly
inhospitable hour, involving no regular meal whatever. Robert begs that I will
order dinner at home exactly as usual, and make it as substantial as possible,
so as to give him every chance of keeping awake at party, and I agree that this
would indeed appear desirable.</p>
<p><i>October 9th.</i>&mdash;Rumour that Lady B.'s party is to be in Fancy Dress
throws entire neighbourhood into consternation. Our Vicar's wife comes down on
gardener's wife's bicycle&mdash;borrowed, she says, for greater speed and
urgency&mdash;and explains that, in her position, she does not think that fancy
dress would do at all&mdash;unless perhaps <i>poudr&eacute;</i>, which, she asserts,
is different, but takes ages to brush out afterwards. She asks what I am going
to do, but am quite unable to enlighten her, as black taffeta already
completed. Mademoiselle, at this, intervenes, and declares that black taffeta
can be transformed by a touch into Dresden China Shepherdess <i>&agrave;
ravir</i>. Am obliged to beg her not to be ridiculous, nor attempt to make me
so, and she then insanely suggests turning black taffeta into costume for (a)
Mary Queen of Scots, (b) Mme. de Pompadour, (c) Cleopatra.</p>
<p>I desire her to take Vicky for a walk; she is <i>bless&eacute;e</i>, and
much time is spent in restoring her to calm.</p>
<p>Our Vicar's wife&mdash;who has meantime been walking up and down drawing-room in
state of stress and agitation&mdash;says What about asking somebody else? What about
the Kellways? Why not ring them up?</p>
<p>We immediately do so, and are lightheartedly told by Mary Kellway that it
<i>is</i> Fancy Dress, and she is going to wear her Russian Peasant
costume&mdash;absolutely genuine, brought by sailor cousin from Moscow long years
ago&mdash;but if in difficulties, can she lend me anything? Reply incoherently to
this kind offer, as our Vicar's wife, now in uncontrollable agitation, makes it
impossible for me to collect my thoughts. Chaos prevails, when Robert enters,
is frenziedly appealed to by our Vicar's wife, and says Oh, didn't he say so?
one or two people <i>have</i> had "Fancy Dress" put on invitation cards, as
Lady B.'s own house-party intends to dress up, but no such suggestion has been
made to majority of guests.</p>
<p>Our Vicar's wife and I agree at some length that, really, nobody in this
world <i>but</i> Lady B. would behave like this, and we have very good minds
not to go near her party. Robert and I then arrange to take our Vicar and his
wife with us in car to party, she is grateful, and goes.</p>
<p><i>October 23rd.</i>&mdash;Party takes place. Black taffeta and Honiton lace look
charming and am not dissatisfied with general appearance, after extracting two
quite unmistakable grey hairs. Vicky goes so far, as to say that I look Lovely,
but enquires shortly afterwards why old people so often wear black&mdash;which
discourages me.</p>
<p>Received by Lady B. in magnificent Eastern costume, with pearls dripping all
over her, and surrounded by bevy of equally bejewelled friends. She smiles
graciously and shakes hands without looking at any of us, and strange fancy
crosses my mind that it would be agreeable to bestow on her sudden sharp
shaking, and thus compel her to recognise existence of at least one of guests
invited to her house. Am obliged, however, to curb this unhallowed impulse, and
proceed quietly into vast drawing-room, at one end of which band is performing
briskly on platform.</p>
<p>Our Vicar's wife&mdash;violet net and garnets&mdash;recognises friends, and takes our
Vicar away to speak to them. Robert is imperatively summoned by Lady B.&mdash;(Is
she going to order him to take charge of cloak room, or what?)&mdash;and I am
greeted by an unpleasant-looking Hamlet, who suddenly turns out to be Miss
Pankerton. Why, she asks accusingly, am I not in fancy dress? It would do me
all the good in the world to give myself over to the Carnival spirit. It is
what I <i>need</i>. I make enquiry for Jahsper&mdash;should never be surprised to
hear that he has come as Ophelia&mdash;but Miss P. replies that Jahsper is in
Bloomsbury again. Bloomsbury can do nothing without Jahsper. I say, No, I
suppose not, in order to avoid hearing any more about either Jahsper or
Bloomsbury, and talk to Mary Kellway&mdash;who looks nice in Russian Peasant
costume&mdash;and eventually dance with her husband. We see many of our neighbours,
most of them not in fancy dress, and am astounded at unexpected sight of
Blenkinsops' Cousin Maud, bounding round the room with short, stout partner,
identified by Mary's husband as great hunting man.</p>
<p>Lady B.'s house-party, all in expensive disguises and looking highly
superior, dance languidly with one another, and no introductions take
place.</p>
<p>It later becomes part of Robert's duty to tell everyone that supper is
ready, and we all flock to buffet in dining-room, and are given excellent
sandwiches and unidentified form of cup. Lady B.'s expensive-looking
house-party nowhere to be seen, and Robert tells me in gloomy aside that he
thinks they are in the library, having champagne. I express charitable&mdash;and
improbable&mdash;hope that it may poison them, to which Robert merely replies, Hush,
not so loud&mdash;but should not be surprised to know that he agrees with me.</p>
<p>Final, and most unexpected, incident of the evening is when I come upon old
Mrs. Blenkinsop, all over black jet and wearing martyred expression, sitting in
large armchair underneath platform, and exactly below energetic saxophone. She
evidently has not the least idea how to account for her presence there, and
saxophone prevents conversation, but can distinguish something about Maud, and
not getting between young things and their pleasure, and reference to old Mrs.
B. not having very much longer to spend amongst us. I smile and nod my head,
then feel that this may look unsympathetic, so frown and shake it, and am
invited to dance by male Frobisher&mdash;who talks about old furniture and birds.
House-party reappear, carrying balloons, which they distribute like buns at a
School-feast, and party proceeds until midnight.</p>
<p>Band then bursts into Auld Lang Syne and Lady B. screams Come along, Come
along, and all are directed to form a circle. Singular m&ecirc;l&eacute;e
ensues, and I see old Mrs. Blenkinsop swept from armchair and clutching our
Vicar with one hand and unknown young gentleman with the other. Our Vicar's
wife is holding hands with Miss Pankerton&mdash;whom she cannot endure&mdash;and looks
distraught, and Robert is seized upon by massive stranger in scarlet, and
Cousin Maud. Am horrified to realise that I am myself on one side clasping hand
of particularly offensive young male specimen of house-party, and on the other
that of Lady B. We all shuffle round to well-known strains, and sing For
<i>Ole</i> Lang Syne, For <i>Ole</i> Lang Syne, over and over again, since no
one appears to know any other words, and relief is general when this exercise
is brought to a close.</p>
<p>Lady B., evidently fearing that we shall none of us know when she has had
enough of us, then directs band to play National Anthem, which is done, and she
receives our thanks and farewells.</p>
<p>Go home, and on looking at myself in the glass am much struck with
undeniable fact that at the end of a party I do not look nearly as nice as I
did at the beginning. Should like to think that this applies to every woman,
but am not sure&mdash;and anyway, this thought ungenerous&mdash;like so many others.</p>
<p>Robert says, Why don't I get into Bed? I say, Because I am writing my Diary.
Robert replies, kindly, but quite definitely, that In his opinion, That is
Waste of Time.</p>
<p>I get into bed, and am confronted by Query: Can Robert be right?</p>
<p>Can only leave reply to Posterity.</p>
