  <h3>First published in <i>Arliss's Pocket Magazine</i>, 1822</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">THE castle of Hernswolf, at the close of the year 1655, was
  the resort of fashion and gaiety. The baron of that name was the most
  powerful nobleman in Germany, and equally celebrated for the patriotic
  achievements of his sons, and the beauty of his only daughter. The estate of
  Hernswolf, which was situated in the centre of the Black Forest, had been
  given to one of his ancestors by the gratitude of the nation, and descended
  with other hereditary possessions to the family of the present owner. It was
  a castellated, gothic mansion, built according to the fashion of the times,
  in the grandest style of architecture, and consisted principally of dark
  winding corridors, and vaulted tapestry rooms, magnificent indeed in their
  size, but ill-suited to private comfort, from the very circumstance of their
  dreary magnitude. A dark grove of pine and mountain ash encompassed the
  castle on every side, and threw an aspect of gloom around the scene, which
  was seldom enlivened by the cheering sunshine of heaven.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">THE castle bells rung out a merry peal at the approach of a
  winter twilight, and the warder was stationed with his retinue on the
  battlements, to announce the arrival of the company who were invited to share
  the amusements that reigned within the walls. The Lady Clotilda, the baron's
  only daughter, had but just attained her seventeenth year, and a brilliant
  assembly was invited to celebrate the birthday. The large vaulted apartments
  were thrown open for the reception of the numerous guests, and the gaieties
  of the evening had scarcely commenced when the clock from the dungeon tower
  was heard to strike with unusual solemnity, and on the instant a tall
  stranger, arrayed in a deep suit of black, made his appearance in the
  ballroom. He bowed courteously on every side, but was received by all with
  the strictest reserve. No one knew who he was or whence he came, but it was
  evident from his appearance, that he was a nobleman of the first rank, and
  though his introduction was accepted with distrust, he was treated by all
  with respect. He addressed himself particularly to the daughter of the baron,
  and was so intelligent in his remarks, so lively in his sallies, and so
  fascinating in his address, that he quickly interested the feelings of his
  young and sensitive auditor. In fine, after some hesitation on the part of
  the host, who, with the rest of the company, was unable to approach the
  stranger with indifference, he was requested to remain a few days at the
  castle, an invitation which was cheerfully accepted.</p>

  <p>The dead of the night drew on, and when all had retired to rest, the dull
  heavy bell was heard swinging to and fro in the grey tower, though there was
  scarcely a breath to move the forest trees. Many of the guests, when they met
  the next morning at the breakfast table, averred that there had been sounds
  as of the most heavenly music, while all persisted in affirming that they had
  heard awful noises, proceeding, as it seemed, from the apartment which the
  stranger at that time occupied. He soon, however, made his appearance at the
  breakfast circle, and when the circumstances of the preceding night were
  alluded to, a dark smile of unutterable meaning played round his saturnine
  features, and then relapsed into an expression of the deepest melancholy. He
  addressed his conversation principally to Clotilda, and when he talked of the
  different climes he had visited, of the sunny regions of Italy, where the
  very air breathes the fragrance of flowers, and the summer breeze sighs over
  a land of sweets; when he spoke to her of those delicious countries, where
  the smile of the day sinks into the softer beauty of the night, and the
  loveliness of heaven is never for an instant obscured, he drew tears of
  regret from the bosom of his fair auditor, and for the first time she
  regretted that she was yet at home</p>

  <p>Days rolled on, and every moment increased the fervour of the
  inexpressible sentiments with which the stranger had inspired her. He never
  discoursed of love, but he looked it in his language, in his manner, in the
  insinuating tones of his voice, and in the slumbering softness of his smile,
  and when he found that he had succeeded in inspiring her with favourable
  sentiments, a sneer of the most diabolical meaning spoke for an instant, and
  died again on his dark featured countenance. When he met her in the company
  of her parents, he was at once respectful and submissive, and it was only
  when alone with her, in her ramble through the dark recesses of the forest,
  that he assumed the guise of the more impassioned admirer.</p>

  <p>As he was sitting one evening with the baron in the wainscotted apartment
  of the library, the conversation happened to turn upon supernatural agency.
  The stranger remained reserved and mysterious during the discussion, but when
  the baron in a jocular manner denied the existence of spirits, and
  satirically mocked their appearance, his eyes glowed with unearthly lustre,
  and his form seemed to dilate to more than its natural dimensions. When the
  conversation had ceased, a fearful pause of a few seconds and a chorus of
  celestial harmony was heard pealing through the dark forest glade. All were
  entranced with delight, but the stranger was disturbed and gloomy; he looked
  at his noble host with compassion, and something like a tear swam in his dark
  eye. After the lapse of a few seconds, the music died gently in the distance,
  and all was hushed as before. The baron soon after quitted the apartment, and
  was followed almost immediately by the stranger. He had not long been absent,
  when an awful noise, as of a person in the agonies of death, was heard, and
  the Baron was discovered stretched dead along the corridors. His countenance
  was convulsed with pain, and the grip of a human hand was visible on his
  blackened throat. The alarm was instantly given, the castle searched in every
  direction, but the stranger was seen no more. The body of the baron, in the
  meantime, was quietly committed to the earth, and the remembrance of the
  dreadful transaction, recalled but as a thing that once was.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">AFTER the departure of the stranger, who had indeed
  fascinated her very senses, the spirits of the gentle Clotilda evidently
  declined. She loved to walk early and late in the walks that he had once
  frequented, to recall his last words; to dwell on his sweet smile; and wander
  to the spot where she had once discoursed with him of love. She avoided all
  society, and never seemed to be happy but when left alone in the solitude of
  her chamber. It was then that she gave vent to her affliction in tears; and
  the love that the pride of maiden modesty concealed in public, burst forth in
  the hours of privacy. So beauteous, yet so resigned was the fair mourner,
  that she seemed already an angel freed from the trammels of the world, and
  prepared to take her flight to heaven.</p>

  <p>As she was one summer evening rambling to the sequestered spot that had
  been selected as her favourite residence, a slow step advanced towards her.
  She turned round, and to her infinite surprise discovered the stranger. He
  stepped gaily to her side, and commenced an animated conversation. 'You left
  me,' exclaimed the delighted girl; 'and I thought all happiness was fled from
  me for ever; but you return, and shall we not again be happy?'--'Happy,'
  replied the stranger, with a scornful burst of derision, 'Can I ever be happy
  again--can there;--but excuse the agitation, my love, and impute it to the
  pleasure I experience at our meeting. Oh! I have many things to tell you;
  aye! and many kind words to receive; is it not so, sweet one? Come, tell me
  truly, have you been happy in my absence? No! I see in that sunken eye, in
  that pallid cheek, that the poor wanderer has at least gained some slight
  interest in the heart of his beloved. I have roamed to other climes, I have
  seen other nations; I have met with other females, beautiful and
  accomplished, but I have met with but one angel, and she is here before me.
  Accept this simple offering of my affection, dearest,' continued the
  stranger, plucking a heath-rose from its stem; 'it is beautiful as the wild
  flowers that deck thy hair, and sweet as is the love I bear thee.'--'It is
  sweet, indeed,' replied Clotilda, 'but its sweetness must wither ere night
  closes around. It is beautiful, but its beauty is short-lived, as the love
  evinced by man. Let not this, then, be the type of thy attachment; bring me
  the delicate evergreen, the sweet flower that blossoms throughout the year,
  and I will say, as I wreathe it in my hair, "The violets have bloomed and
  died--the roses have flourished and decayed; but the evergreen is still
  young, and so is the love of heart!"--you will not--cannot desert me. I live
  but in you; you are my hopes, my thoughts, my existence itself: and if I lose
  you, I lose my all--I was but a solitary wild flower in the wilderness of
  nature, until you transplanted me to a more genial soil; and can you now
  break the fond heart you first taught to glow with passion?'--'Speak not
  thus,' returned the stranger, 'it rends my very soul to hear you; leave
  me--forget me--avoid me for ever--or your eternal ruin must ensue. I am a
  thing abandoned of God and man--and did you but see the scared heart that
  scarcely beats within this moving mass of deformity, you would flee me, as
  you would an adder in your path. Here is my heart, love, feel how cold it is;
  there is no pulse that betrays its emotion; for all is chilled and dead as
  the friends I once knew.'--'You are unhappy, love, and your poor Clotilda
  shall stay to succour you. Think not I can abandon you in your misfortunes.
  No! I will wander with thee through the wide world, and be thy servant, thy
  slave, if thou wilt have it so. I will shield thee from the night winds, that
  they blow not too roughly on thy unprotected head. I will defend thee from
  the tempest that howls around; and though the cold world may devote thy name
  to scorn--though friends may fall off, and associates wither in the grave,
  there shall be one fond heart who shall love thee better in thy misfortune,
  and cherish thee, bless thee still.' She ceased, and her blue eyes swam in
  tears, as she turned it glistening with affection towards the stranger. He
  averted his head from her gaze, and a scornful sneer of the darkest, the
  deadliest malice passed over his fine countenance. In an instant, the
  expression subsided; his fixed glassy eye resumed its unearthly chillness,
  and he turned once again to his companion. 'It is the hour of sunset,' he
  exclaimed; 'the soft, the beauteous hour, when the hearts of lovers are
  happy, and nature smiles in unison with their feelings; but to me it will
  smile no longer--ere the morrow dawns I shall very far, from the house of my
  beloved; from the scenes where my heart is enshrined, as in a sepulchre. But
  must I leave thee, dearest flower of the wilderness, to be the sport of a
  whirlwind, the prey of the mountain blast?'--'No, we will not part,' replied
  the impassioned girl; 'where thou goest, will I go; thy home shall be my
  home; and thy God shall be my God.'--'Swear it, swear it,' resumed the
  stranger, wildly grasping her by the hand; 'swear to the fearful oath I shall
  dictate.' He then desired her to kneel, and holding his right hand in a
  menacing attitude towards heaven, and throwing back his dark raven locks,
  exclaimed in a strain of bitter imprecation with the ghastly smile of an
  incarnate fiend, 'May the curses of an offended God,' he cried, 'haunt thee,
  cling to thee for ever in the tempest and in the calm, in the day and in the
  night, in sickness and in sorrow, in life and in death, shouldst thou swerve
  from the promise thou hast here made to be mine. May the dark spirits of the
  damned howl in thine ears the accursed chorus of fiends--may the air rack thy
  bosom with the quenchless flames of hell! May thy soul be as the lazar-house
  of corruption, where the ghost of departed pleasure sits enshrined, as in a
  grave: where the hundred-headed worm never dies where the fire is never
  extinguished. May a spirit of evil lord it over thy brow, and proclaim, as
  thou passest by, "THIS IS THE ABANDONED OF GOD AND MAN;" may fearful spectres
  haunt thee in the night season; may thy dearest friends drop day by day into
  the grave, and curse thee with their dying breath: may all that is most
  horrible in human nature, more solemn than language can frame, or lips can
  utter, may this, and more than this, be thy eternal portion, shouldst thou
  violate the oath that thou has taken.' He ceased--hardly knowing what she
  did, the terrified girl acceded to the awful adjuration, and promised eternal
  fidelity to him who was henceforth to be her lord. 'Spirits of the damned, I
  thank thee for thine assistance,' shouted the stranger; 'I have wooed my fair
  bride bravely. She is mine--mine for ever.--Aye, body and soul both mine;
  mine in life, and mine in death. What in tears, my sweet one, ere yet the
  honeymoon is past? Why! indeed thou hast cause for weeping: but when next we
  meet we shall meet to sign the nuptial bond.' He then imprinted a cold salute
  on the cheek of his young bride, and softening down the unutterable horrors
  of his countenance, requested her to meet him at eight o'clock on the ensuing
  evening in the chapel adjoining to the castle of Hernswolf. She turned round
  to him with a burning sigh, as if to implore protection from himself, but the
  stranger was gone.</p>

  <p>On entering the castle, she was observed to be impressed with deepest
  melancholy. Her relations vainly endeavoured to ascertain the cause of her
  uneasiness; but the tremendous oath she had sworn completely paralysed her
  faculties, and she was fearful of betraying herself by even the slightest
  intonation of her voice, or the least variable expression of her countenance.
  When the evening was concluded, the family retired to rest; but Clotilda, who
  was unable to take repose, from the restlessness of her disposition,
  requested to remain alone in the library that adjoined her apartment.</p>

  <p>All was now deep midnight; every domestic had long since retired to rest,
  and the only sound that could be distinguished was the sullen howl of the
  ban-dog as he bayed, the waning moon Clotilda remained in the library in an
  attitude of deep meditation. The lamp that burnt on the table, where she sat,
  was dying away, and the lower end of the apartment was already more than half
  obscured. The clock from the northern angle of the castle tolled out the hour
  of twelve, and the sound echoed dismally in the solemn stillness of the
  night. Sudden the oaken door at the farther end of the room was gently lifted
  on its latch, and a bloodless figure, apparelled in the habiliments of the
  grave, advanced slowly up the apartment. No sound heralded its approach, as
  it moved with noiseless steps to the table where the lady was stationed. She
  did not at first perceive it, till she felt a death-cold hand fast grasped in
  her own, and heard a solemn voice whisper in her ear, 'Clotilda.' She looked
  up, a dark figure was standing beside her; she endeavoured to scream, but her
  voice was unequal to the exertion; her eye was fixed, as if by magic, on the
  form which, slowly removed the garb that concealed its countenance, and
  disclosed the livid eyes and skeleton shape of her father. It seemed to gaze
  on her with pity, an regret, and mournfully exclaimed--'Clotilda, the dresses
  and the servants are ready, the church bell has tolled, and the priest is at
  the altar, but where is the affianced bride? There is room for her in the
  grave, and tomorrow shall she be with me.'--'Tomorrow?' faltered out the
  distracted girl; 'the spirits of hell shall have registered it, and tomorrow
  must the bond be cancelled.' The figure ceased--slowly retired, and was soon
  lost in the obscurity of distance.</p>

  <p>The morning--evening--arrived; and already as the hall clock struck eight,
  Clotilda was on her road to the chapel. It was a dark, gloomy night, thick
  masses of dun clouds sailed across the firmament, and the roar of the winter
  wind echoed awfully through the forest trees. She reached the appointed
  place; a figure was in waiting for her--it advanced--and discovered the
  features of the stranger. 'Why! this is well, my bride,' he exclaimed, with a
  sneer; 'and well will I repay thy fondness. Follow me.' They proceeded
  together in silence through the winding avenues of the chapel, until they
  reached the adjoining cemetery. Here they paused for an instant; and the
  stranger, in a softened tone, said, 'But one hour more, and the struggle will
  be over. And yet this heart of incarnate malice can feel, when it devotes so
  young, so pure a spirit to the grave. But it must--it must be,' he proceeded,
  as the memory of her past love rushed on her mind; 'for the fiend whom I obey
  has so willed it. Poor girl, I am leading thee indeed to our nuptials; but
  the priest will be death, thy parents the mouldering skeletons that rot in
  heaps around; and the witnesses to our union, the lazy worms that revel on
  the carious bones of the dead. Come, my young bride, the priest is impatient
  for his victim.' As they proceeded, a dim blue light moved swiftly before
  them, and displayed at the extremity of the churchyard the portals of a
  vault. It was open, and they entered it in silence. The hollow wind came
  rushing through the gloomy abode of the dead; and on every side were piled
  the mouldering remnants of coffins, which dropped piece by piece upon the
  damp mud. Every step they took was on a dead body; and the bleached bones
  rattled horribly beneath their feet. In the centre of the vault rose a heap
  of unburied skeletons, whereon was seated, a figure too awful even for the
  darkest imagination to conceive. As they approached it, the hollow vault rung
  with a hellish peal of laughter; and every mouldering corpse seemed endued
  with unholy life. The stranger paused, and as he grasped his victim in his
  hand, one sigh burst from his heart--one tear glistened in his eye. It was
  but for an instant; the figure frowned awfully at his vacillation, and waved
  his gaunt hand.</p>

  <p>The stranger advanced; he made certain mystic circles in the air, uttered
  unearthly words, and paused in excess of terror. On a sudden he raised his
  voice and wildly exclaimed--'Spouse of the spirit of darkness, a few moments
  are yet thine; that thou may'st know to whom thou hast consigned thyself. I
  am the undying spirit of the wretch who curst his Saviour on the cross. He
  looked at me in the closing hour of his existence, and that look hath not yet
  passed away, for I am curst above all on earth. I am eternally condemned to
  hell and I must cater for my master's taste till the world is parched as is a
  scroll, and the heavens and the earth have passed away. I am he of whom thou
  may'st have read, and of whose feats thou may'st have heard. A million souls
  has my master condemned me to ensnare, and then my penance is accomplished,
  and I may know the repose of the grave. Thou art the thousandth soul that I
  have damned. I saw thee in thine hour of purity, and I marked thee at once
  for my home. Thy father did I murder for his temerity, and permitted to warn
  thee of thy fate; and myself have I beguiled for thy simplicity. Ha! the
  spell works bravely, and thou shall soon see, my sweet one, to whom thou hast
  linked thine undying fortunes, for as long as the seasons shall move on their
  course of nature--as long as the lightning shall flash, and the thunders
  roll, thy penance shall be eternal. Look below! and see to what thou art
  destined.' She looked, the vault split in a thousand different directions;
  the earth yawned asunder; and the roar of mighty waters was heard. A living
  ocean of molten fire glowed in the abyss beneath her, and blending with the
  shrieks of the damned, and the triumphant shouts of the fiends, rendered
  horror more horrible than imagination. Ten millions of souls were writhing in
  the fiery flames, and as the boiling billows dashed them against the
  blackened rocks of adamant, they cursed with the blasphemies of despair; and
  each curse echoed in thunder cross the wave. The stranger rushed towards his
  victim. For an instant he held her over the burning vista, looked fondly in
  her face and wept as he were a child. This was but the impulse of a moment;
  again he grasped her in his arms, dashed her from him with fury; and as her
  last parting glance was cast in kindness on his face, shouted aloud, 'not
  mine is the crime, but the religion that thou professest; for is it not said
  that there is a fire of eternity prepared for the souls of the wicked; and
  hast not thou incurred its torments?' She, poor girl, heard not, heeded not
  the shouts of the blasphemer. Her delicate form bounded from rock to rock,
  over billow, and over foam; as she fell, the ocean lashed itself as it were
  in triumph to receive her soul, and as she sunk deep in the burning pit, ten
  thousand voices reverberated from the bottomless abyss, 'Spirit of evil! here
  indeed is an eternity of torments prepared for thee; for here the worm never
  dies, and the fire is never quenched.'</p>
