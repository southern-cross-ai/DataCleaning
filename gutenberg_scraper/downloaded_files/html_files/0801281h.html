<h2><a name="ch0" id="ch0"></a>AUTHOR'S NOTE</h2>

<p>These people never were, and the incidents here recorded could
not therefore have happened to them. They remain more vivid than
reality because of imagination. I ramp impatiently, desirous of
progressing to other scenes and souls, but, demonstrating the full
scale of human emotions, they crowd about me suffocatingly,
craving&mdash;nay, demanding&mdash;perpetuation. I am faced by a
patternless, trackless region out of which I must urgently beat my
way like the early explorers, uncertain if I am merely going round
and round, or right through, or slipping out the side by a false
route.</p>

<p>"You poor old nonentities," I exclaim in the irritation of
fatigue and close confinement to their affairs. "What profit in
agitating the printing-presses on your behalf! You are not among
those who have contributed ideas to human knowledge, nor have you
taken the human race one flicker above the mud on that road to
super-humanhood for which some of us gape."</p>

<p>"Bah!" they retort. "That stuff's all tommy rot! No matter what
airs of spiritual or mental superiority people give themselves,
it's all a bottle of smoke in the end, and the end is before you
can bally well get your pipe to draw decently. They will all lie
down and die and rot like the cows and horses, and, in spite of all
the faith and belief, no one knows for a dead cert if they have any
more soul, or as much as old 'Flea Creek', who carried the
salt-bags out on the Run because the other horses were too flash
for the job."</p>

<p>"That's all very well," I contend, "but it does not solve the
problem of your inconsequence as material from which to concoct a
story. Whatever happened to you but that you were born in your
turn, grew up in your turn, were smitten with the procreative urge
or scourge&mdash;sometimes out of your turn&mdash;and tried to
marry women who seldom wanted you; whereupon you turned to those
more obliging, and who served equally well; whereupon you
reproduced your species without male restraint or mercy to the
limit of female capacity and endurance; and the reproductions like
yourselves mostly, were not worth the women's birth-pangs, nor the
women worth any other sort of pangs. Then in due time you were
buried, and ordinary funerals are as monotonously alike as infants.
One generation of you was but a repetition of a former, with a
marriage or a funeral as a highlight&mdash;not a single epic
adventure to create a hero, nor a hero to engineer an epic
adventure in the whole boiling!"</p>

<p>"Hold hard!" says one old philosopher, who has thought much in
the solitudes. I see him on the outer edge of the crowd. "Is it
real life here in this part of the world you're driven to make this
blanky book about, or is it about some strange, unusual, far-away
land, with kings and savages, or professors and millionaires, and
other kinds of fantastic people?"</p>

<p>"It has to be set bang here in Australia, with none but you
kicking up your heels and using bad language in the middle of the
natural scenery."</p>

<p>"Well, then, it seems to me that all you have to do is yarn
along and make us come alive just as we blooming well were. Let us
drivel and meander like life itself. You have nothing to do with
the way of our lives or the character of our performances, whether
big or little, or dull, or exciting. If a funeral, or a marriage,
or a drought, or a flood, or a snake-bite, or a spree, or a broken
leg was our greatest experience, that is not your responsibility.
Blow it all, you're not the Lord Himself! You have only to show how
things were without any squirming about the why or how. You don't
need to swell your head with shaping destiny or interpreting life
according to those new-fangled blokes who never baked a damper, or
felled a tree, or rode a buck-jumper, or killed a snake or a beast,
or tanned a hide, or broke in a team of bullocks, or knocked up a
coffin for a mate out of stringybark, or drank water out of their
hats. You just set us down on paper as we were, without any of your
own shenannakin!"</p>

<p>There! Put in my place as simple delineator and comforted by
bearing in mind that life is the most discursive and fragmentary
experience, I proceed free of misgivings about the flatness of the
contours or the duller colours of my material, and concerned only
with what I can capture of inevitability, actuality, proportion. My
"squirming" shifts to the realization of my own bewildering
nescience in face of the task which sucks me down. Why, in a
universe revolving upon marvels, magnitudes, and problems, before
which the best of human intellects are but as thimbles to conserve
or direct Murrumbidgees, and man's day but an ephemeral hazard like
that of the horse-fly at Wamgambril swamps snapped by the
iridescent kingfisher in his flight, should I be possessed to limn
the inconsequent pioneers and horses that have gone?</p>

<p>Howbeit, I must deliver myself of my love and loyalty to them,
before my own precarious moment in this consciousness is ended.</p>

<p>If achievement be maddeningly inadequate to conception and
inspiration, nevertheless for the sake of peace I must press on. If
I do my task only roughly, as the old pioneers knocked up their
humpies and blazed their tracks single-handed against untamed
nature, well, that cannot be helped. There are hosts to come after
me&mdash;that is all!</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>"Stick to him, Jerry! Stick to him!"</p>

<p>"Garn! Stick to your grandmother! He's only pig-rootin'!"</p>

<p>"Ole Flea Creek could do better'n that! You orter seen him last
spring!"</p>

<p>"Stop that, you &mdash;&mdash; fool!" commanded an older voice.
"What the hell do you mean, kicking the insides out of a horse just
to show off? There'll be plenty real riding to take the flashness
out of you and the mokes before the muster is done!"</p>

<p>"Ssh! Milly!" said another in honour of a girl verging on teens,
balanced on the top rail of the horseyards.</p>

<p>"Blow her! What's she doin' here? Oughter be home learnin' to
sew!"</p>

<p>"Milly, you better go home," commanded her uncle, overhearing.
"This is no place for you. Your mother wants you."</p>

<p>"Mother's coming herself to see them back Corroboree."</p>

<p>"He's not going to be backed today. Billy's not here."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is. He's coming down from the huts now. Besides, Uncle
Bert said I could go to the muster."</p>

<p>"You'll get your neck broken!"</p>

<p>"No fear! I could stick anything in my new saddle, and Uncle
Bert is going to take me himself." Milly put out her tongue behind
her relative's back. Covert grins. The boss was not popular: Milly
was, and in danger of being spoilt. Young Farquharson tweaked her
long pigtail. Milly moved closer to Uncle Bert, where there was
safety.</p>

<p>A busy time had come for the Run. The professional buyers for
the Indian Army were expected, and the usual crowd that would as
soon have missed the local agricultural shows as a muster were
arriving for the fray. Among the top-rail critics and advisers were
neighbouring squatters and station-hands as well as horse-fanciers
and touts from Monaro, Queanbeyan, Yass, Goulburn, Tumbarumba, Bool
Bool, Tumut, and Gundagai, who had come to look for strays or to
pick up a promising colt or filly in advance from the stations
celebrated for their products.</p>

<p>There were friends like Curradoobidgee Poole and Ronald Dice of
Bookaledgeree, who had ridden from afar to take home their own
strays and lend a hand in general: there were the Farquharsons from
farther down the River&mdash;the river Murrumbidgee&mdash;smart
fellows and great on harness horses. There were Billings and
Cross-eyed Prendergast from Gundagai, in hopes of securing
something for the coach lines, since the Milford brothers of
Jinninjinninbong, over the river&mdash;the river
Coolgarbilli&mdash;had introduced a coaching strain of late years,
and the muster on that station was a joint affair with Ten Creeks
Run. There was little Tommy Roper, unattached bachelor and
horse-trainer at large, who picked up a living partly by following
the shows with his hunters, and by droving, etc., between whiles.
He was the man of the hour by reason of his recent epic which had
left dead bullocks along the route from Riverina to the Victorian
border, and incidentally left Tommy bankrupt, but he hoped to make
a fresh start with something likely from the impending muster.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Old Jack Stanton, boss of Ten Creeks Run, and son of the
original Stanton of Stanton's Plains, Bool Bool, before he became
old Jack, had gone down the River&mdash;the river
Murrumbidgee&mdash;to Turrill Turrill and started in sheep, where
he did well. He had, however, never been weaned from the mountain
country and with spare capital started a horse station with some
first-class blood at Ten Creeks. In droughty summers he also
travelled his sheep up. Friends and neighbours were the Milfords,
natives of the other side towards Yass, who had secured
Jinninjinninbong and other runs and established permanent homes on
the opposite side of the Coolgarbilli, and were known for the
uniformly high quality of their mob horses.</p>

<p>Jack Stanton was unmarried. His widowed sister&mdash;Milly's
mother&mdash;kept house for him. She enjoyed the mountains, and
often spent half the year in the home-made wooden house on the
Coolgarbilli. It was due to her presence, and that of the Mesdames
Milford, that there was a sprinkling of women guests among the
musterers. The Farquharsons were accompanied by two sisters, and
Aileen Healey had come with her brother Larry from Neangen Station
adjoining Bookaledgeree. Aily was as pretty as the girls on
chocolate-boxes, as her mirror told her any time she looked in it,
a pleasant story now being confirmed in the eyes of the muster,
and, most enchantingly to her, in the eyes of Ronald Dice.</p>

<p>It was the liveliest time of the year for these inaccessible
stations. House and huts were full. Mrs Saunders had an ex-sailor
in the kitchen and in the house proper a couple of brumby girls
supplemented by intermittent help from as many rouseabouts as could
be filched from the pursuits of the Run. They were easy to filch
with two such baits as Sarah and Ellen Humphreys, and the girls
among such swarms of admirers no sooner felt their affections
beginning to root on one desirable than they were uprooted by the
intrusion of another.</p>

<p>A fine draft of colts and fillies was expected this season to do
credit to the brand "SP over J"&mdash;SP standing for the original
Stanton's Plains, which each son retained as he set up for himself
and added his own initial below. The runs were to be combed from
the Wamgambril almost to the Jenningningahama and the head of the
Murrumbidgee through to the fringe of the Bimberies and
Tidbinbillies and back to Jinninjinninbong and Ten Creeks.</p>

<p>There were forty or fifty saddle horses in the home yards that
glorious morning, most of them seasoned stock horses, with a few
ladies' hacks and beasts fit for any show, and all in top
condition. Some, turned out since last summer, were expected to be
collar-proud and more experienced buckers than bewildered colts
undergoing their first ordeal. There were several celebrities on
rebel count, or for their pedigrees and potentialities. Foremost of
these was Corroboree, a glorious four-year-old, sixteen hands, coal
black, luxuriant of mane and tail, the spit of his imported sire,
owned by the Potters of Cuppinbingle, farther down the river. The
Potters were known for their hard riding and hard swearing, with a
good deal of carousing and other virility thrown in, and as the
best breeders and judges of horse-flesh from the Murrumbidgee to
the Murray. One of them was expected on the morrow, and today was
represented by a trainer and Mick Muldoon, the latter a horny old
boundary-rider, drover, etc., who did not remember learning to ride
or when he first camped out on his lone.</p>

<p>Opinion was so in favour of backing Corroboree and others that
SP-over-J had to let the morning go in a buck-jumping tourney.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>William Bowes, known as Flash Billy the Breaker, now approached,
and interest shifted to a young man with limbs loosely hung and
disproportionately long for his body, like a pair of tongs. His
black hair was sleekly greased and grew low above his eyes on his
small bullet head. His face was garnished with two black lawns
foment his ears and a slick moustache with coquettish curls at the
ends. He had glaringly strapped trousers, a tight short coat, a
bright blue-fronted waistcoat, and the light boots of the horsey
acolyte. Everything about him was flash, from the ring on his
little finger to his long spurs, and the cabbage-tree hat "hanging
on three hairs", as his contemporaries expressed it, and coloured
the right shade like a meerschaum. He had tested his frame and
earned renown breaking for Curradoobidgee, Gowandale, Cuppinbingle,
and other stations previously to having all he could do on Ten
Creeks. It was never denied that he had earned his sobriquet
honestly. He had arrived but a few hours earlier from Queanbeyan
and was in holiday apparel. He swung up to the top rail beside
Milly and spat with terrific efficiency onto Corroboree as he was
being run round the yard with head aloft and the carriage of an
emperor.</p>

<p>"He crackles like a bag of rattlesnakes. Golly, just listen to
him!" observed Long Billy, the rouseabout.</p>

<p>"What makes him make that noise? Is that good or bad?" inquired
Milly. This raised a guffaw. Uncle Bert came to her rescue.</p>

<p>"My old dad, who knew more about a horse than any man I
know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not more than you, Uncle Bert, surely?"</p>

<p>"I can manage to tell a horse from a cow if I'm not too rushed,
but my dad knew all that was to be known about the gee-gees, and
the more the colts would rattle the better pleased he'd be."</p>

<p>"I reckon he was dead right," confirmed Flash Billy.</p>

<p>"What about ketchin' him, Billy?" inquired Jerry Riddall.</p>

<p>"Wait till mother comes; she and the girls want to see him. I'll
catch old Readymoney while we're waiting."</p>

<p>"Don't attempt such a thing!"</p>

<p>"You'll have your eyes kicked out!"</p>

<p>Protest arose from all round the top rail from men with halters
or bridles awaiting a propitious moment to drop among the crowd
cunning in presenting slickly aimed heels to the enemy.</p>

<p>"If you won't let me ride Romp, I shan't have anything but
Readymoney. The others are logs of wood. It would take the polled
Angus team to hold or slew them."</p>

<p>"Don't attempt Readymoney till Billy gives him a turn. He bucked
like blue murder last spring," said SP-over-J.</p>

<p>Readymoney was a sweater's horse, one taken illegally and ridden
till knocked up and turned adrift. His brand was botched, so he had
never been claimed. He had been trained down the country and was
the delight of Milly and other women riders for his urbane manners.
Trained paces set a gap between the stock horse and the saddle
horse. High prices were given by Sydney and Melbourne buyers for
paced thoroughbreds guaranteed free from vice, with trial
permitted. SP-over-J filled this kind of order, and in meeting it
Billy Bowes was an artist of importance.</p>

<p>"Flash Billy's like a feller outer a circus. He can learn a
horse to do anythink but talk," his admirers proclaimed.</p>

<p>He had been reared in the right atmosphere, his dad having been
an old lag who had served his time on Cuppinbingle, and Billy, the
last of his litter, was cradled in the Potter stables in which he
learnt the more aristocratic methods of horse-training. His mother
was a Red Rover lass, which is highly irrelevant, the lass and her
old man having been long abed in a grave near their hut where the
itching cattle were pushing the palings down, and high grass and
thistles on the mound made a home for a pair of fat old goannas
what time the Corroboree colt was being tamed. The old hands used
the grave as a landmark, but it is obliterated today; the killing
of timber alters the face of the ranges, and the old
hands&mdash;what few of them remain&mdash;are growing
forgetful.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Scornful of warnings, Milly dropped into the crowd with her
pretty bridle, its blue forehead-band threaded through a macrame
fly-chaser. Poole of Curradoobidgee dropped down behind her, but
Readymoney, sneezing his goodwill, allowed the little girl to
secure him. She led him out of the ruck in triumph, and when eves
were off her, slipped astride his fat back and cried, "Open the
gate while I ride the bucking outlaw through!"</p>

<p>"Get down at once! You ought to be ashamed of yourself," said
her uncle.</p>

<p>"Then I'll ride sideways." She changed and Readymoney ambled
away without protest.</p>

<p>The ladies were now coming from the house with Ronald Dice and
Mr Eustace Blenkinsop in attendance.</p>

<p>"Come on, Billy, shall we put the tackle on the colt?" asked
Jerry Riddall.</p>

<p>"Put it on the Wamgambril fust. He'll do yous for a start to
warm up," said Flash Billy with consequence.</p>

<p>"Young Dice seems to be stickin' like a fly in tar to the
ladies," remarked young Billings to Dan Spires, the overseer.</p>

<p>"You'll see him wherever there's a bit of rag about. He's like
me," interposed Flash Billy.</p>

<p>"All the good riders seems to be weak on the skirts," said Jerry
Riddall flatteringly. "What have you done with your girl,
Billy?"</p>

<p>"Left her in Queanbeyan till next week." Billy was fluttering
round a barmaid there.</p>

<p>"I heard a cove from Goulburn was top o' the runnin'," remarked
Long Billy, the rouseabout.</p>

<p>"That tin mug with the handle off!" Billy was contemptuous. "You
might git left. You never can tell with females. The
&mdash;&mdash;s seem to pick out the mugs and pass by the likeliest
chaps for spite," said Cross-eyed Prendergast.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they think you're looking at someone else all the
time," ventured Long Billy.</p>

<p>"Begor', if the faymales didn't pick the culls, some of yez
would stand a fat chance of iver getting married at all." This was
Mick Muldoon's contribution.</p>

<p>"Is that why you're an old bachelor?"</p>

<p>"Maybe Oi'm wan of the proizes was passed over for the culls by
the spoiteful faymales."</p>

<p>"It's Aily Healey!" observed young Billings, as the ladies drew
near. "How did she get here?"</p>

<p>"On old Healey's chestnut mare, that's how; but if you want to
know why, go ask Ron Dice," said little Tommy Roper, by reason of
his aptitude and peregrinations, so forehanded in other people's
affairs that he was credited with eyes in the back of his head.</p>

<p>"Ron Dice! Wotta yer mean?"</p>

<p>"Some fun there, I betcher! Ole Skinny Guts has shown signs of
stickin' up to her since the show in Bool Bool," continued Tommy in
a whisper.</p>

<p>"Who says that?" demanded Timmy Porter, eager on the track of
gossip.</p>

<p>"Anyone with as much gumption as a wall-eyed wombat can see some
things for himself," said Tommy.</p>

<p>Further confidences were impossible. Teddy Parsons, Long Billy,
Jerry Riddall, and others had the tackle on the Wamgambril colt, so
named from the direction of his foaling, and he stood breathing
defiance in one of the outer yards. These youths were as tough as
greenhide, having been dragged up on cockatoo selections about Bool
Bool, but they lacked horse-flesh to squander, so for the present
held ambition in leash and waited upon the great.</p>

<p>"Any cove like to show off what he can do fust?" called Billy.
"I ain't been outer the saddle for a couple of days, and ain't had
any sleep since the night before last."</p>

<p>"Here s a chance for volunteers," cried Ronald Dice gaily from
the top rail as he sat between Rose Farquharson and Aily Healey,
tenderly helping Aily to balance.</p>

<p>"Surely yous ain't afeared of a buster or two," continued Billy.
"I git 'em meself now an' again if I git playin' the goat."</p>

<p>Tim Porter stepped forward. He had a bullet head and a large,
loose mouth. He and his dad before him had been brought up on
Bookaledgeree, where old Tim Brennan of The Gap had set up Tim,
jun., some thirty years before this history takes its rise.</p>

<p>"I'd jist like to try," he said, paling round the gills. Tim
would never be a crack. He lacked the intelligence, and a
horse-breaker who does not have that needs to be minus a
derangeable nervous system. Tim mounted amid copious advice from
the top rail. The colt went into action immediately.</p>

<p>"Stick to him, Tim! Hang on a little longer! He's givin'
in!"</p>

<p>"He can't ride! The colt's only pig-rootin'!"</p>

<p>"Pooh! He's hangin' on by his spurs!"</p>

<p>"The next root will bring him a buster."</p>

<p>Tim was stood on his head, his gymnastics greeted by guffaws. He
got up and walked off with a forced grin.</p>

<p>"Well tried, old man!" said Dice kindly. "You only want to grip
better with your knees and throw your weight with the movement of
the horse&mdash;practice will do it."</p>

<p>"Who's next?" called Flash Billy.</p>

<p>"If someone will put my new saddle on him," said Milly, "I could
easily stick those bucks."</p>

<p>A gale of laughter greeted this. "You could ride him all right,"
said Poole quietly, "but sticking a buck is no game for a girl: no
game for a man either with any savvy, and it's no good for the
horse, and unnecessary."</p>

<p>"Sure, 'tis tin chances to wan the beast wouldn't buck at all if
you got on him, missy," said Mick Muldoon. "Only the Creathor
Himself knows the way of high-spirited horses with women. A blood
horse that would jump out av his hoide to get rid of a crack rider
will let a hoigh-spirited gurrul play circus thricks wid him, him
lettin' out snorts of contint. Or he will let a short-witted man
put a pack-saddle on him an' climb aboord himself atop of the load.
Sure, there's food for the philosophers there. Can ye explain it,
Mr Poole, an' ye knowin' more av a horse than annywan aloive?"</p>

<p>"The trouble is, Muldoon, that we drive horses to buck and then
break them of it. It would be much better if they were never let
buck at all, and never learnt how, but that of course can't be done
with so many to handle."</p>

<p>"Gettin' frightened!" whispered Tommy Roper to Dan Spires. "The
greatest rider that ever threw a leg over a horse in his young
days! I've seen the day when no horse could do nothing with
him&mdash;not very long ago neither; an' when he'd get tired of
buckin', his nibs would rouse him up again&mdash;must be losin' his
teeth altogether."</p>

<p>"Coin' barmy to talk like that, I reckon. Aw, he's an old geezer
now. I hope I'll kick the bucket before ever I get like that. No
more good than a &mdash;&mdash; ole woman!"</p>

<p>"Ye re roight, av coorse, Mr Poole, but ye couldn't git thim
young turkey cocks to credit it. But how do ye explain it furder
with a horse that has been learnt to buck&mdash;take ould
Readymoney now with Miss Milly on him bareback, an' she could have
taken a tin can on with her to boot and he wouldn't disturb a nest
of eggs in a silk hat, but if Flash Billy got aboord him there
would have been the Ould Gintleman to pay."</p>

<p>The Breaker was called Flash Billy to his face to avoid
confusion with Long Billy. He took no umbrage, considering it a
tribute of jealousy to his smart trousers and waistcoats.</p>

<p>"I think it bears out what I have said," replied Poole. "A woman
is not allowed on a horse till the buck is out of him, so he has no
fear of her as an enemy, and all is friendly from the start."</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>A traveller was announced by the watch-dogs among the heelers,
kangaroo dogs, and mongrels&mdash;visiting and resident&mdash;that
were settling differences by direct action.</p>

<p>"Hogan's ghost! Here's old Teddy O'Mara!" announced the
hawk-eyed Billy Bowes. This was disputed, betted upon, and settled
by the appearance of a large brindled kangaroo dog followed by a
smaller grey one, both in poison muzzles of perforated leather
securely strapped on, protecting their lives and robbing them of
joy. Behind them on a track down the river a horseman came out of
the timber.</p>

<p>"He allus has them old dawgs."</p>

<p>"I never see them used for anything."</p>

<p>"Couldn't use them for nothing but to kill fowls or sheep."</p>

<p>"Keeps 'em for company, I reckon."</p>

<p>"It's a lonely thing to be travellin' without a dawg."</p>

<p>The horseman bent forward in somewhat the posture later
introduced by Tod Sloan, and since adopted by all professional
jockeys. In that clay it was the distinguishing antic of a
half-wit.</p>

<p>"Queer ole feller! Always lays on his belly on horseback.
Oughter git a bed an' be done with it."</p>

<p>"He turned in at Keba before we left. We wanted him to anchor
there, because we have plenty to keep him going," said young
Farquharson.</p>

<p>Teddy hitched his horse in the line outside the yards, kicked a
few dogs from his path, and beamed upon the company. "Well, Teddy,
are you travelling or only going somewhere?" said Dice.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' as far as I'm goin'," said Teddy. He was a tall man
with greying whiskers in unclipped possum formation. His tousled
curls protruded through a tattered felt bat: he wore a ragged
overcoat despite the warm day, and twine served as bootlaces.
Fearless decency shone from his clear blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Have you got married yet, Teddy?"</p>

<p>"No fear, the missus wouldn't let me."</p>

<p>"That's right, Teddy, you listen to what she says," commended
Mrs Saunders, and remarked to Flora Farquharson, "I think it',
disgusting to talk about marriage to that sort of men&mdash;might
put dangerous notions in their heads about women."</p>

<p>"Heard you were at Keba for the summer," said Poole, and shook
hands with him.</p>

<p>"No fear, that lousy old Farquharson offered me thirty bob a
week. 'Keep your lousy thirty bob,' I says to him. 'I never work
for less than a pound a week.' Ha! Ha! Ha!"</p>

<p>A kookaburra chorus ensued.</p>

<p>"My word, Teddy! That's the way to treat the blasted bosses!"
laughed Dice.</p>

<p>"Your father ought to be ashamed of himself to play a dirty
trick like that on poor old Teddy," smiled Poole at
Farquharson.</p>

<p>"It was pretty low-down. I must see into it," laughingly agreed
Farquharson.</p>

<p>"But I put the bell on him, you bet I did!" maintained Teddy
hilariously. Again the guffaws at a primitive type of
humour&mdash;which persists out of proportion to man's development
in other ways&mdash;the propensity of the five-eighths-witted to
find intense delight in guying the half-witted.</p>

<p>"Where are you bound for now&mdash;staying here?" asked
SP-over-J.</p>

<p>"No fear! I'm making over the river to my young missus."</p>

<p>Two or three years previously the younger Milford had captured
one of the Labosseer girls of Coolooluk, and it was to her that
Teddy referred. His beat ran from Coolooluk to Curradoobidgee on
Monaro and from there to Ten Creeks and Jinninjinninbong back to
the Mazeres and Stantons of Bool Bool. Now and again a squatter
outside the circle tried to entice Teddy with a higher wage, but
usually met the fate of the Farquharsons because he could not count
higher than a pound. His headquarters were with Mrs Rachel
Labosseer. On her estate perfection reigned. Every stray man,
Chinese, dog, or horse that came that way received attention. There
Teddy returned when destitute and in tatters, and from there he was
never allowed to depart without warm clothing and stout boots, and,
if it was winter, an overcoat. A steam-roller could not have
deflected him from seemliness, but he had to live life on his own
terms as one of God's fools. Horse-breaking since he was twelve or
fourteen, not even outlaws were untamable by him, but he left them
with nature's paces and believed a walk an example of equine
debauchery brought about by contact with cities. The cities to him
were strange towns like Goulburn, Gundagai, and Wagga Wagga. Bool
Bool and Cooma were home paddocks where to diddle Teddy brought
upon the miscreant a dragooning from a Mazere, Labosseer, Brennan,
or Poole.</p>

<p>Seeing that the dogs were all without muzzles, no baits having
been laid for weeks before the muster, Teddy released his pets.</p>

<p>"Well, Teddy, you're in the nick of time," said Dice. "We're
going to ride the Corroboree colt and when he's flung us all you
can have a turn."</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>A fresh arrival brought word that the Milford brothers would be
over on the morrow to run the Bull Flat Creek mob into trap-yards
out that way, so the clay was relinquished to recreation. The more
immediate sports opened briskly. Half a dozen young fellows with
more energy than intelligence were soon raising a dust in the outer
yards.</p>

<p>"I don't see any real fun in this bucking business," remarked
Lucy Saunders. "It must rack a man."</p>

<p>"Of course it does," agreed Flora Farquharson. "Mother told
me..." She lowered her voice for a juicy confidence. "You must tell
me tonight."</p>

<p>Men's ribaldries regarding women were mostly obscenities about
such basic facts as the procreative functions, and fed a distorted
or debased craving for genuine humour, but the remotest men would
have been staggered to know what percolated to women of their
beings, and as strictly divested of prurience as a surgeon's
treatise. There was nothing hidden from a decent full-witted woman
concerning a man in those districts if she had a mind to know, and
less hidden from the indecent. It has always been so. It will be
more so as time goes on, but what men do not know of women is that
about which women deceive them, plus what women do not know of
themselves.</p>

<p>Flash Billy was genuinely tired from lack of sleep and hard
riding consequent upon pursuit of l'amour, and merely kept an eye
on the active practitioners. The prince of riders that day was
Ronald Dice, elated because Aily Healey was an onlooker and that
old SP-over-J seemed to be narked. Larry Healey was not riding, for
a recent accident had strained his shoulder and he was resting to
be ready for the feats of the muster. Dice's performance was easy
and dashing. By sheer high spirits he excited his mounts and was
not among those suffering falls. Admiration in Aily's pretty eyes
was too much for SP-over-J.</p>

<p>"The real rider is the one who can stick Corroboree for five
minutes when he really goes to market," said he. "Anyone who can do
that can have his pick of the first yard of yearlings run in
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Is that a real offer?" asked Flash Billy. Stanton never flung
his money about. "Skinny Guts" had more reference to his parsimony
than to his physique.</p>

<p>"A square offer this morning to everyone within hearing, and
I'll make it for anything under three years old."</p>

<p>"I wish I was not so thunderin' tired," complained Flash
Billy.</p>

<p>"You and Mr Poole can be the timekeepers and judges." This
mollified the Breaker. "Besides, there's not much chance of anyone
winning&mdash;not anyone riding today. They can flop about on
ladies' hacks pig-rooting, but let them have a go at Corroboree and
they'll find their class."</p>

<p>There was a stir to rope and gear the colt, the snorting beauty,
short of rib with barrel splendidly rounded, big in the girth,
shoulders well laid in, great legs and quarters, built like a rock
to stay, with breeding and intelligence stamped all over him. He
came from a proud line of winners on the sire's side and on the
other had a strain of Poole's famous Black Belles and
Waterfalls.</p>

<p>When he was saddled, Jerry Riddall was the first to step
forward. One of the greatest drovers known, young Jerry had never
been off the roads till he engaged himself for a change on Ten
Creeks. He was a better sprinter than rough rider, but the mob
spirit here edged him on.</p>

<p>The colt was deceivingly calm. Equine intelligence pitted
against human had so far kept him free from surrender. The flash
bravado of horse-breakers could be a tea-party for two. Here was no
terrified sufferer with quivering flank, tail tight between the
hindquarters, and ears laid back. It was Jerry that trembled and
had his tail between his legs.</p>

<p>Milly supported Poole as timekeeper when he took out his watch,
a gold repeater presented to him over thirty years before when,
single-handed, he had rid the Southern District of a guerrilla band
of bushrangers.</p>

<p>Jerry hardly seated himself when a marvellous lurch flung him in
the air. Dan Spires, the overseer, the second candidate, speedily
met Jerry's fate. Then followed Jim Porter. Paddy Leary, the
Cuppinbingle trainer, next had a try, but Corroboree dislodged him
with the lightning lurch.</p>

<p>"The trouble with this 'ere colt is vice," said Flash Billy.
"He's been at these capers for 'most a year now and it looks like
he'll never give over."</p>

<p>"He's got the rale thoroughbred spring in him, an' he's carryin'
his tail like a paycock, an' him the spit of his dad. Sure, if he's
niver safe but for to pack salt 'tis a pity," observed Muldoon.</p>

<p>"With thorough precautions, I'd like a try," said Alistair
Farquharson.</p>

<p>"Me first," said Long Billy. He took no end of precautions. He
dampened the saddle amid the jeers of the spectators, and
blindfolded the colt. Flash Billy and Dice led him round the
ploughed yard before they took off the handkerchief and backed
away. The colt merely raised his perfect muzzle and sniffed the
morning breeze, honey-sweet with wattle borne down the valley to
the music of the Coolgarbilli. Long Billy led off gingerly. Not a
buck.</p>

<p>"Touch him up a little!" commanded Stanton. Long Billy dug a
heel in his flank, but the horse did not seem to object.</p>

<p>"I don't think he's going to&mdash;" One splendid backward lurch
onto his hindquarters and Long Billy went onto the wither, another
forward and the rouseabout shot off like a pebble from a catapult
amid shouts of glee.</p>

<p>There was a rush to recapture the colt lest he should clear the
dog-leg fence of the bucking-yard and get away with the saddle, a
deep-seated treasure with perfect knee-pads, but the colt only
trotted back to the gate of the inner yard to be near his mates,
allowing himself to be caught without fuss. Poole noted that he was
quite calm, showing no touch of bad temper.</p>

<p>"Great Scott, what a clinker!" exclaimed young Dice, who had not
seen him in action till then. "All he needs seems to be a rider.
Have you tried him lately, Billy?"</p>

<p>"I'm allers tryin' him."</p>

<p>"Can he get rid of you?"</p>

<p>"I allers tire fust. He's as active as a cat, an' a stayer, an'
as cunning as Beelzebub."</p>

<p>"He only needs a rider, though, for all that," said Stanton
insinuatingly. "I've seen the day when Poole could have bested him
without any fuss at all. Young fellows nowadays can't ride like
they used to. They're not game!" He slyly watched the effect of his
words on Aileen Healey. He half feared that if Dice took the
challenge he might win, though Corroboree had not turned a hair
yet. Wait till a succession of tormentors got his blood up!</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Bert, why don't you try now?" demanded Milly. "I'm
sure he couldn't chuck you. Wouldn't you love to see Uncle Bert on
him, Aileen?"</p>

<p>"I'd hate to see anyone hurt," said Aileen dubiously.</p>

<p>"She'd rather watch some of the flash young fellows who think
they can ride," said Stanton.</p>

<p>"The colt ain't in his top form today," said Bowes.</p>

<p>"That's good news," said Alistair Farquharson. "I'll have a go
and chance the dux." He had watched the horse's methods and thought
he could be ready for his sudden prop.</p>

<p>A few vigorous bucks failed to dislodge him. Alistair stirred
him up and was treated to the backward prop. Surviving this he
began to feel hopeful, but he could not read the colt's mind for
the next move. It was an oblique lunge to the off-side and a
swing-hack to the left with such terrific speed and strength that
Alistair might as well have tried to sit a derrick loose in a
southerly. It placed him on the crupper and a bound forward set
Corroboree free.</p>

<p>"I managed the prop but that twister did for me," said Alistair,
getting up and dusting himself with unruffled amiability. "I'd
rather break him to harness with my new-fashioned breast
collar."</p>

<p>"That's allers the way with him. You may think you learnt all
his moves, but you'll allers find him one ahead of the game."</p>

<p>"I'd like a go just to show I'm not yellow," said Dice, stepping
up and examining the tackle. He vaulted to the saddle with strength
and grace and spurred the horse into immediate action. His tactics
were to put him on the defensive. The onlookers enjoyed an
exhibition of every kind of buck with a breather between the
efforts&mdash;side to side, the sharp swing round, kicking-up and
bucking forward at the same time, and compelling the rider to
employ two kinds of seat simultaneously. This failed to dislodge
young Dice.</p>

<p>"He's the only feller of me own age I'd ever be afeared of
taking second place to," said Bowes commendingly, "but he's only
been on a couple er minutes yet."</p>

<p>SP-over-J grew uneasy. "You must stir him up. You mustn't camp
till the time is up," he called out harshly.</p>

<p>Ronald applied a prick of his heel. The horse was warming up.
Terror was stealing into his haughty heart such as no rider had
been able to put there since he had dislodged the first
impertinence. When first backed he had felt similar terror. Here
was one who might be a fixture. A convulsion of rage stirred the
horse. Back and forth, up till he was perpendicular as a man! This
being unavailing, he finally acted like a dog with a heavily
charged bait and in frenzy flung himself clean backwards. A spur
high in the glinting sun, the clink of a stirrup, and his tormentor
rolled from under with agility and presence of mind.</p>

<p>With a snort of satisfaction Corroboree trotted away.</p>

<p>"You pulled him too far over. Would you like a second try?"
inquired Stanton suavely.</p>

<p>"No, Mr Stanton, that wasn't it," interposed Billy. "It's what I
was sayin'; it's vice. That's what he does when he can't get rid of
you by fair means."</p>

<p>"Going to take a second shot?" persisted Corroboree 's owner.
"Not now, thanks," said Dice, dusting himself and working his limbs
to be sure they were uninjured. "He's bested me fairly, but I
shouldn't call it vice, would you, Mr Poole?"</p>

<p>"No, Ronnie, I shouldn't. I've never seen a better bit of
riding, but when it came to bedrock he was the better warrior. It's
not the right way to tackle that beast, if I know anything."</p>

<p>"Teddy! Now's your chance!"</p>

<p>"Come on, Teddy&mdash;Teddy O'Mara up!"</p>

<p>"Don't let the poor old fellow on that beast. He might be
killed," said Mrs Saunders.</p>

<p>"It's not fair! He's getting too old!" said Rose Farquharson.
"They say it was a fall on his head when he was little left him as
he is," said her sister.</p>

<p>"I should say he came short from his mother," said Stanton.</p>

<p>"He's not short on lots of things that others would be better to
be a bit longer on," said Poole. "I don't know a decenter old
fellow from here to the Upper Murray. No woman has ever had to make
a complaint about poor old Teddy, and he works his passage through
life."</p>

<p>"It's a shame to barrack him onto an outlaw," said Milly. "He's
too old."</p>

<p>"Strange thing, being a little short mentally, I don't believe
he knows he's getting old," said Poole.</p>

<p>Teddy could not be kept off the colt now. He placed his own
saddle, with wads of horse-hair sticking from under the seat where
mice had found a lying-in ward. Someone had jockeyed him out of the
sound article with which he had left Coolooluk six months earlier.
He did not discard his flapping overcoat. He put one foot in the
stirrup, jumping several times to gain momentum to rise. The noble
beast courteously awaited his guest. Teddy mounted, clouted with
his old hat; Corroboree, with the sneeze that voices equine
goodwill, set off at a dog trot round the yard. Teddy reined in
before the ladies and chanted:</p>

<p>"Me feyther and mother were Irish, And I was Irish too; We
bought a tin kettle for ninepence, And knocked up an Irish
stoo!"</p>

<p>"He's tired for the day," said Farquharson.</p>

<p>"Phwat did I tell yez about women and thim that's not all
there!"</p>

<p>"He's all right if you ride about like a girl!" gibed Dan
Spires. "Stir him up, Teddy. He's afraid you'll fall off."</p>

<p>Teddy flapped his hat but the charger only mended his pace a
little. The gibes began to anger Teddy. Other tunes, other fashions
in the efflorescence of virility. In those days a roan would have
been considered effeminate to minimize bucking. Teddy yawed on the
bit, but the horse was taking no ungentlemanly advantage. Flash
Billy reached out with a roping pole and pricked him under the
tail. He resented the indignity by gaining his freedom with a smart
buck. Old Teddy rolled away unhurt.</p>

<p>Poole spoke aside to Stanton, "Say, Jack, if you like to trust
roe with that colt for a few weeks, I'll return him fit for Milly
to ride, or I'll make a swop for him."</p>

<p>"I don't want to part with him, but if you'll take him on, you
can have the pick of the youngsters as I promised."</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>"Ronnie, do please ride Romp for me," coaxed Milly.</p>

<p>"Is she an outlaw, too?"</p>

<p>"Anyone could stick her bucks," Flash Billy hastened to explain,
"but she's a vicious little devil and no two ways about it. She
lays down when she finds she can't get red of you, an' when she
finds you can lepp back on her as often as she comes down, she'll
jump right out of everythink. I'd like you to have a go at her,
just to see, but as I'm makin' a lady's hack outer her for Miss
Milly I want to keep her mouth from bein' spiled&mdash;it's like
velvet now," concluded Billy with sweet reasonableness.</p>

<p>"I couldn't risk spoiling your work. You give us an
exhibition."</p>

<p>Romp was the daughter of Young Whisker, the famous polo pony
that had been purchased for an Indian rajah. Old Whisker his dad,
was as famous a galloway sire as ever put to stud, and, like many
other celebrities, the discovery and property of the Potters of
Cuppinbingle. His granddaughter, Romp, was a unique beast such as
is seen once in ever so seldom in a mob where there is an admixture
of pure blood. Her dam, Lady Lochinvar, bred on Curradoobidgee, had
been a tall flyer with a swinging stride that could give dust to
any amateur racer run for saddles and bridles up the country. Had
high jumping attained its present vogue she could have established
a record. She had cleared the Curradoobidgee horse-yards, seven
feet if they were an inch, and built like a jail. She jumped out of
Mazere's orchard in Bool Bool, no pound could retain her for five
minutes. Withal her canter gallop were pneumatic and her mouth so
delicate that a child of four could hold her, and she was never
'mown to shy or even prance in spring. When she was quite old but
still a treasure, Milly bad received her as a present from Uncle
Bert, beloved of children and with pockets full of just the safest
nags for them to ride.</p>

<p>Lady Lochinvar's youngest daughter was a blue roan, with black
mane and tail. She flashed round the yard in the sparkling day, one
of the daintiest fillies that ever tasted the waters of the
Murrumbidgee. The small head had fire and symmetry, the chest,
shoulders, and well-planted legs promised a weight-carrier and
stayer. She was as hard as nails with a grace and strength of
action guaranteeing goat-like sure-footedness&mdash;the perfect
polo pony, with outr&eacute; colouring to make her the darling of a
girl's heart. Before two she had been handled and given to Billy to
pace. That was fifteen months since. Billy's report was that she
was a she-devil and would never be safe as a lady's hack. Milly
refuted this with heat. It had grown to a feud between Billy and
Milly.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't she be a picture with hogged mane and tail! In a nice
light trap with my new breast collar she'd take every prize from
here to Melbourne. Will you sell her to me for harness, Milly?"
teased Alistair Farquharson.</p>

<p>"If Billy's too much of a softy to train her, I'll do it myself.
You can have old Flea Creek for harness!"</p>

<p>The Breaker mounted and the filly went round the yard like an
angel. "She's so tricky," said he, "you'd think butter wouldn't
melt in her mouth, and then, whew!" He touched her with the spur.
Away went the little spitfire, bucking like a demented kitten and
rolling viciously on the near side. Billy was out of her way like
an acrobat and back into the saddle as she righted without dropping
the reins. Cheers from the top rail. Romp went down on the other
side.</p>

<p>"She jist doesn't want anyone on her and will never rest till
she gits 'em off. I don't mind her now, because I can feel when
it's comin', but she'd be a nice safe little picnic for a lady on a
sidesaddle with skirts," said Billy as he dismounted.</p>

<p>"Let me have a go at her," said Dice. "She ought to be ridden
hard for a week and never stirred up till she forgets about
bucking."</p>

<p>"Billy is always telling lies about the poor little thing. I
don't know why he has such a set on her," said Milly warmly.</p>

<p>"We'll get to the bottom of this, Milly, old chum," said Poole
in a comforting aside.</p>

<p>"Let her git her head down an' touch her on the flank same as a
lady with skirts couldn't help doin', an' see what the treacherous
little tyke will do," said Bowes.</p>

<p>Dice obeyed. Romp was stirred to violent action and by some
sleight retreated from every scrap of gear without straining a
buckle&mdash;a feat possible to perhaps one horse in a million.</p>

<p>"She won't have a skerrick on her, and that's all there is about
it," said Billy conclusively.</p>

<p>"You ought to sell her to a circus, Milly," suggested
Spires.</p>

<p>"I'll never, never sell her. I'll keep her to look at," said
Milly, brushing away indignant tears, "and no one shall ever ride
her if I can't."</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>Cooees summoned the muster to lunch. Near the house Mrs Saunders
was met by the cook in wild excitement. Released from muzzles, and
led by Teddy O'Mara's champions, the kangaroo dogs had carried out
a raid on the beef cask. While the cook rushed to save something
there, the big brindle had seized the midday round hot from the
dish. The meat supply had been demolished. The cook had a gun and
was firing wildly. Canine yelps indicated some of his targets.
Teddy rushed to the rescue of his darlings regardless of his own
safety. It looked like a dangerous imbroglio till Poole, Stanton,
and others applied the brakes.</p>

<p>Mrs Saunders ordered a lunch of eggs, cheese, and tinned fish,
and called for volunteers to shoot wild ducks for the evening
dinner.</p>

<p>"If Bert hasn't lost his eye he can feed the multitude in a shot
or two," said Stanton.</p>

<p>"Long Billy, as soon as you've had dinner, take a pack-horse and
ask Mr Milford to let you have a wether to kill. You'll be back
before bed-time."</p>

<p>The muster continued cheerfully towards the house. Milly led the
saucy blue roan, which rubbed her head against her doting mistress
with the assurance of an old hand.</p>

<p>"What's she goin' to do with the blanky filly?" inquired Long
Billy.</p>

<p>"Take her to bed with her, p'raps," said Flash Billy
disgustedly. "That's allers the way with a lady's hack. Good
material spiled, I call 'em." He emitted voluble scares to Stanton
about the treacherous filly's heels, but Milly was not to be
separated from her, and hitched her to the palings at the bottom of
the garden.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>A jovial company sat down to the substituted meal. Mr
Blenkinsop, gentleman at large, reviewed A. L. Gordon's poems and
Mr Gladstone's latest speech. Others talked of the popularity of
roller-skating, the coming pigeon match at Gundagai, or the need of
a branch railway line to Bool Bool, and of the new bridge over the
Yarrabongo. The bridge was to he officially opened during the
coming month. Old Mrs Mazere of Three Rivers&mdash;Great-grandma
Mazere&mdash;was to cut the ribbon.</p>

<p>Milly's mind was on the pony, and, finishing her pudding in a
hurry, she stole away from her end of the table. The whole station
staff was safe in midday meal or smoko, so she took her gear
unobserved and placed the pretty little saddle of black hog-skin on
the ornate cloth, braided like an officer's, and with horses' heads
worked in the corners, and buckled the girths. She had sometimes
turned Romp on her back when very tiny to play with her perfect
hoofs&mdash;impossible that she could be spiteful or dangerous!
They had come all the way from Turrill Turrill to Stan-ton's Plains
one season, Dlilly riding old Lady Lochinvar with Romp following,
and neither of the young things the worse for the long trek. "I'll
not put any hot old crupper or breastplate on you, darling, and you
aren't a villain, are you? It's that awful pig of a Flash
Billy."</p>

<p>She kissed and fondled her pet affectionately, and examined the
flank, to find it pricked with the spur. "Romp darling, you'll
never buck again, will you, except in fun? And I'll not let that
Flash Billy touch you again."</p>

<p>She made sure that no one was stirring to frustrate her, and
mounted tremulously, Romp walked demurely down the hollow away from
the house, without disturbing the heelers and kangaroo dogs
snoozing on nefariously full bellies, thence to the open flat along
the river and away like the wind, playmates frolicking
together.</p>

<p>"Oh, you darling, darling love!" Milly flung down her reins and
clasped the filly's neck in adoration, indulged her with a drink
from the Slate Pool, from which ducks rose in clouds, and then
tried various paces, shouting with glee, and fetched up at a stiff
pace in view of the family and guests who had come out on the
veranda. Milly was elated to prove the filly a lady. "Look" she
cried. "Look! she doesn't buck or roll or do anything but be an
angel like she always has been since she was the teeniest weeniest
foal!"</p>

<p>The spectators ejaculated and expostulated. Milly was too
engrossed to give ear.</p>

<p>"Look! She's got her head down." The greedy little brute had
espied a mouthful of clover. "Look! and while she has her head down
I can do what I like with her flank and she doesn't care. Who says
she is spiteful and vicious? She hates Billy, and so do I, with his
old spurs a mile long. Spurs are loathsome. All you have to do is
to have a sort of feeling and horses will race like the wind. No
one shall ever ride her now but me!"</p>

<p>"Horses," began Mr Eustace Blenkinsop, who had ridden from
Bookaledgeree with Ronald Dice to spend some weeks sitting about or
duck-shooting. "Horses," repeated Mr Blenkinsop, to whom everybody
listened unless racing to the muster, or basting to get a beast
killed before dark, or otherwise so pressed as to abrogate the
polite respect which Mr Blenkinsop's old-world assurance of
breeding and superiority commanded, "have a chivalrous affinity
with the ladies."</p>

<p>"Get off that filly at once!" commanded Uncle Jack. "Whatever
for? She's as tame as Lady Lochinvar."</p>

<p>"Evidently it is only men to whom she objects," reiterated Mr
Blenkinsop.</p>

<p>"What do you say to letting me take Romp home just to set her
paces?" said Poole. He had gone down the garden. "It looks as if
she has been taught tricks."</p>

<p>"That would be loverly! Can I go home with you too?"</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>"The horses nowadays are a poor lot av dunkeys. Sure, they'd
crumple up onder the horses that Poole turrned out up to tin or
fifteen years ago, and as for old Poole that died a few years back,
sure Oi remimber..."</p>

<p>Mick Muldoon stood with his face to the company and his back to
the fire, a man of ripe virility as vouched by his hairiness. He
had whiskers up to his eyes, they flowed afar on his chest,
sprouted from his ears and nostrils and, by contrariness, were
scantiest round his mouth, which could be discerned through the
ambush, wide and loose, combining an expression of hilarity and
ferocity. The dog he had been was discernible in his poise, in the
spotted calfskin waistcoat with carved quandong buttons mounted in
silver, and in the tilt of his hat, which he rarely doffed.</p>

<p>"Aw, you're allers blowing about the old days," said Flash Billy
testily. "It stan's to reason they hadn't the horses we have now,
when the breed's bein' improved all the time."</p>

<p>"Oi wouldn't waste me breath on ye," said Mick grandly. "Belting
a good beast to pieces and teachin' it vicious thricks!"</p>

<p>"What's the good of listening to an old codger!" snorted Billy,
irritable with fatigue and a day that had gone badly.</p>

<p>"Sure, ye're very flash now, Bill Bowes, but the day is soon
coming whin my ould coat will fit your behoind, and ye won't be
able to spile good beasts with dhirty thricks for y'r own profit,
and ye'll have no ch'racter. Moi ch'racter will stand against anny
man's."</p>

<p>"What's your 'ch'racter' ever done? You're barmy!"</p>

<p>It was evening in the men's hut. Certain identities like Billy,
Teddy O'Mara, and Muldoon had the privilege of eating in the
kitchen, but this evening had chosen the hut for its company.</p>

<p>"Hogan's ghost! Billy," exclaimed Long Billy, drifting in from
the kitchen, "did you know that young Milly rode the Young Whisker
filly up and down the place like hell at dinner-time? Sent her full
lick with the reins swingin', an' grabbed up fistfuls of her flank,
an' the filly takin' it like ole Flea Creek." Flea Creek, a famous
slug, so named for his beginnings, was used to pack salt and pull
the water-slide.</p>

<p>"Tell that to the marines!"</p>

<p>"There ain't ever anyone to be let ride her again but young
Milly."</p>

<p>"Where did this fish-yarn spring up?" Billy was beginning to be
uneasy.</p>

<p>"He's been maggin' to Ellen Humphreys in the kitchen," said
Jerry Riddall.</p>

<p>"Ask her, if you don't want to believe me," persisted Long
Billy.</p>

<p>"Phwat about yer ch'racter now, an' me being barmy, am Oi? Oi
wasn't rared onder a bin, Oi'm tellin' ye," interposed Mick.
"They're foindin' out yer thricks..."</p>

<p>"That's where you're dead wrong, you &mdash;&mdash; old
billy-goat. Another word out o' you and I'll shy the bread at your
ole pumpkin head." Billy got up, kicking a stool over, and left the
hut.</p>

<p>"His girl is givin' him the turnip, that's what's up with him,
an' he's too fond of thinkin' he's Lord Muck anyhow," said Long
Billy.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jerry Riddall, "an' I reckon young Mr Dice can run
rings roun' him stickin' a buck."</p>

<p>"Talkin' o' girls and turnips and such," said Tommy Roper,
"there'll be some fun here presently. Did yous twig the play at the
yards today atween the boss and Dice?"</p>

<p>"Gam!" said Paddy Leary from Cuppinbingle. "What yer givin'
us?"</p>

<p>"Anyone can see Dice and Aily Healey think they was made for
each other, and at the same time the boss looks as if he's goin' to
hang his hat on three hairs an' make up to her too."</p>

<p>"Fat lot o' chance he'd have, the ole goat. A girl'd be as
likely to fall in love with a wombat." This was Tim Porter's
idea.</p>

<p>"I dunno! Money makes the mare go," said Jerry.</p>

<p>"Aw, that ole pilgarlic! Ain't the Dices got a good place at
Bookaledgeree? I'd rayther have it than either Ten Creeks or
Jinninjinninbong, stuck up here among the wombats an' dingoes, or
Turrill Turrill down there in the droughts," maintained Tim. "Big
share this feller will have with all them young ones comin' on.
Besides, Bookaledgeree is mortgaged over the ears and out the other
side, an' old Healey would skin his grandmother and sell her hide
if he was pushed, an' if ole Skinny Guts puts his moneybags before
him it will be a slice of turnip for young Ronald all right."</p>

<p>"Aw, I dunno," repeated Jerry.</p>

<p>"Who do you bet on, Tommy, the ole cove or Ronald Dice?"</p>

<p>"I'll bet anyone my bridle against a new saddle pouch that the
ole cove will come out top because ole Healey is as fierce and
greedy as hell, I'm yous; an' the girl will be too weak in the
knees to stan' up to him. Ole Healey is like all of them that can't
keep money theirselves; he worships the spondulics. He thinks it
can do everything."</p>

<p>"Well, so it can," said Jerry eagerly.</p>

<p>"It can do a lot all right, but then again there's a lot of
things it can't do."</p>

<p>"Tell us some, Tommy."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think money would buy the Young Whisker filly
from Milly, an' money may make Ally Healey marry old SP-over-J, but
I bet you all the money in hell it will never make her love
him."</p>

<p>"And ch'racter," added Mick Muldoon. "Money will never buy
ch'racter. But phwat do these prisint-day mongrels care about
ch'racter? They used to talk about the ould lags, but if you
treated the ould lags phroper they was daycint min. Oi've niver
seen thim turrn on annyone who treated thim phroper, but these
fellers, begor' if ye carried thim on your back for siven years and
put thim down for tin minutes to take a spell, sure, they'd take
opportunity of that tin minutes to rob ye."</p>

<p>"Here, Mick, never mind about your 'ch'racter' now. If you are
such a know-all, why didn't ole Skinny Guts ever marry? Do you
know?" It was Red Jimmy, the surveyor's link man, inquiring. His
master was working in the district and not averse from a day at the
muster or homestead.</p>

<p>"Av coorse Oi know. Oi know iverything about him, and whin Oi
tell a thing it's true, not loike these liars wid nawthing in their
heads."</p>

<p>"Never min' about that now&mdash;p'raps it's like the
horses...tell us the story."</p>

<p>"Curradoobidgee Poole never married neither," observed Tim
Porter.</p>

<p>"He was throwed over by that ole Miss Macorkaran, wasn't her
said Jerry.</p>

<p>"Sure, a quischin is asked and ye haven't the breedin' to listen
to a reply nor the brains to onderstand if ye did."</p>

<p>"I'm the man who knows most about it," piped old Bill Heffernan
from Wamgambril Flats, where he engaged in trapping wallabies and
dingoes. He had dummied for Larry Healey's uncle on Monaro in '61
when the Free Selection Act came in. He was dummying now for
Stanton towards the head of the Wamgambril and had come in for the
muster. The boss here was never after ole Jess Macorkaran. It was
she that was after Bert Poole. He was a fine cut of an upstanding
man in them days, for all he is a lap-dog now for all the little
gurrls that call him uncle.</p>

<p>"And who was Poole after?" The link man had a newcomer's
interest in sorting out the identities.</p>

<p>"He used to have eyes for none but Mrs Labosseer, mother of Mrs
Harry Milford over the river," said Heffernan.</p>

<p>"Ye're wrong," said Mick. "Bert Poole was engaged to Mrs
Labosseer's sister, Emily, daughter of the ould Mazere of Three
Rivers, daughter of the same ould Mrs Mazere who is goin' to open
the bridge."</p>

<p>"Her that was drownded in the Mungee, and Poole has never looked
at no one since," contributed Tommy Roper. "Me ma used to tell me
about it."</p>

<p>"Everyone knows about Bert Poole an' the Miss Mazere that was
drownded in the Mungee, but Skinny Guts wasn't after her too, was
he?"</p>

<p>"Sure, the boss here was hell-for-leather afther Mary Brennan,
sister of ould Tim at The Gap, but she wouldn't look at him, and
took the veil. That was away back in '57. No, it was '58. Tell ye
how Oi remimber."</p>

<p>"We don't care how the hell you remember if you'll only spit it
out," said Red Jimmy, who was listening open-mouthed.</p>

<p>"Oi'm the wan to blame for evening me wits to such an assimbly
of gissobs," said Mick, retreating in lofty disdain into the ambush
of his beard, from which he spat lustily.</p>

<p>"Well, Mick, I didn't insult you or rob you while I got off of
your back for a spell or anythink," said Paddy Leary, a cheerful
vassal. "Let's have the old stick's love affairs. I wouldn't have
thought he'd ever have had enough juice in him to be in love."</p>

<p>"The dried-up ones is sometimes madder after the women than the
pot-bellied ones. Look at ole&mdash;" began Tim Porter.</p>

<p>"Oh, go and shove your head in a bag and dry up for a bit&mdash;
Mick has the floor," said Leary.</p>

<p>Mick re-emerged. Racially he was a born conversationalist or
monologist: the solitary conditions of the boundaries of the back
runs and the taciturnity of the colonials restricted his life. "The
master here was woild afther the daughter of ould Tim Brennan
that's been in his grave tin years an' more. Oi disremimber whether
it was January or February&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never min' wot you disremember, shoot ahead with the love
story, for God's sake, an' be done with it."</p>

<p>"He! He!" cackled Jerry. "Tim's gone on Ellen Humphreys and
wants the love&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I ain't, you &mdash;&mdash; fool. I want to turn in. We've got
to be out before it's light. Why the hell wouldn't she marry him
an' be done with it?"</p>

<p>"She niver married annyone. She took the veil an' died in ould
Oireland an' was brought home an' buried at The Gap in the
flower-garden there. Ye can see the paling fince and the tombstone
anny toime ye have the moind."</p>

<p>"Ye're off the track," said Heffernan. "More people has been
reared under a hen than knows it, and a duck hen at that. It was
Emily Mazere that had 'em all roarin' like town bulls, all but
black Poole, him that was sittin' up on the fence today beside
young Milly, an' he contrarywise was the only one she wanted. Ole
Denny Healey and his brother Larry, the dad of young Aily, was
madder than any after her too, and two of the flashest coves that
ever dragged a stockwhip in the dust."</p>

<p>"I've often heard mum and the ole man talkin' of it," said
Jerry</p>

<p>Riddall. "Mum used ter work for ole Mrs Mazere. Mary Brennan was
smitten on Mr Poole too, but others reckons it was the boss here,
and that neither would give way about religion, and that's why Mary
went for a nun and died of consumption when she was only thirty,
an' that's what slewed the boss off the skirts and turned him to
money-grubbin'."</p>

<p>"What for, when he had no girl to give it to?" inquired Tim
Porter.</p>

<p>"Aw, I bet it ain't that what put him on the money-grubbin'.
It's in a man, an' nothing won't take it out or put it in."</p>

<p>"You know so &mdash;&mdash; much you oughter set up as a
lawyer."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not so snotty about it as them that knows less,"
retorted Leary with a good-tempered grin.</p>

<p>"Seein' as Flash Billy's cake is baked, he can sell that old
donkey supper hat of his to the boss. It's used to goin' mashin'
an' hanging on by three hairs already," said Tommy Roper.</p>

<p>"Aw, an ole cove like that, he wouldn't be able&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it! When the spasm takes 'em, the old blokes
goes barmier than the young ones."</p>

<p>"I reckon a girl would have to be cross-eyed to take old
SPover-J while Ronnie Dice was in the runnin'," commented Tim
Porter. "If I wuz a girl, I'd rather live on the smell of an oiled
rag with a feller like Ronnie than take old Ten Creeks with Turrill
Turrill throwed in to fatten dingoes."</p>

<p>"But it ain't what you or Aily thinks; it's what ole Larry says
that goes, an' he'd rather marry any one of them female daughters
of his to a black snake if it had money than to a angel without,"
maintained Tommy Roper.</p>

<p>"Every dog has his day," observed Heffernan. "Ole Poole had a
hell of a fine day, not only all the purty fillies mad after him,
but he was the greatest rider and shot, and cleared up the
bushrangers, and still goin' strong."</p>

<p>"You're &mdash;&mdash; well right," agreed Leary.</p>

<p>"My &mdash;&mdash; oath I'm right. The missus here is workin'
herself cross-eyed to collar him now, and Milly would jump at him
for a stepfather."</p>

<p>"Fat lot er chance ole Lucy's got if he's never looked at no one
since his sweetheart was drownded."</p>

<p>"He might give way when he gets old and silly. He's a
goodlookin' bloke yet, an' a nice one too. I'd rather work for him
than ole Skinny Guts any day," said Tim Porter.</p>

<p>"For the Old Harry's sake stop yer everlastin' maggin',"
complained Long Billy from the inner chamber, where bunks of
stringybark stretched in three tiers round the walls. The window
was a wooden shutter; wide cracks between the shrunken slabs
provided daylight and ventilation. The rouseabout was ready to call
it a day after buckjump-riding in the forenoon and a long, hard
ride to fetch a sheep in the afternoon. "Come on in, some of you
damn' fellers, or the bugs an' fleas will walk away with me. It
ain't fair. They're all mustered on me. Come an' take your share. I
don't want to be a fattenin' paddick for the whole &mdash;&mdash;
lot."</p>

</p>

<p>The Milfords arrived next morning, bringing with them Kerry, the
famous photographer, and the expedition to Bull Creek was deferred
in favour of posing before the camera, while the ringing music of
horseshoes being shaped on the anvil by a succession of blacksmiths
for the forefeet of stock horses never ceased. In a few of the
surviving houses of the locality, where there remains an old hand
to preserve things of the past, there may still be found
stereoscopes and views perpetuating the musters of Ten Creeks Run
and Jinninjinninbong. Through the twin lenses blood horses, long
dust, and their daring or dainty riders, now stiff and frail, stand
out in seemingly solid relief, so hauntingly still that they touch
the heart to tears.</p>

<p>Milly with streaming hair was photographed on Romp, and the
Misses Farquharson and Healey on their respective animals showed
their hour-glass waists and soft young faces above stiffing
collars. Teddy O'Mara and Mick Muldoon, SP-over-J, the mad sailor
cook, the new surveyor, Flash Billy the Breaker, Paddy Leary, the
brazen kangaroo dogs, the blood colts and fillies, Flea Creek, all
are preserved for those who can pick them out, as well as a round
dozen or more to whom even Larry Healey or Harry Milford cannot put
the names today.</p>

<p>There were no moving-picture cameras then to pickle these
gladiators in motion in the ordinary day's work, as they performed
feats that no rodeo could now excel. The youth of today would deem
the old-time commonplaces of that muster impossible, or but
senility's drivelling of the glory of days that are gone. In these
days there is only one of the Milfords left; for lack of a
sympathetic audience, he never talks of his exploits. The young
fellows snorting about in motors have no interest for him, and he
is nervous in their machines, he who that summer in natural daring
rode blood colts down a ridge of black Mount Corroboree, while even
the hardened spectators held their breath for the outcome! That
spring, too, it was Harry Milford, aided by Larry Healey&mdash;the
only rider who could keep near him&mdash;who put the Bull Flat mob
into the trap-yards back of Mount Corroboree after a run lasting
from 9 a.m. till 5 p.m.</p>

<p>The stereoscope shows none of this, but only a stillness
haunting as the memory of a voice that has lately enchanted and
dropped for ever to silence. In the cavern of the lenses all has
been stricken to colourless rigidity, granite boulders, flowering
trees and shrubs, men and maids, horses and dogs alike, for ever
petrified in youth unchanging beside the leaping lacy Coolgarbilli,
singing on its way to old Mother of Waters.</p>

<p>Old Blenkinsop&mdash;"gentlemanly ole feller"&mdash;is shown on
Scutty, an imported mare so named for her docked tail, and owing to
which she had been early set apart for stud purposes, for the
natives would as lief been seen abroad with a Jonah minus an eye as
on a beast so mutilated. Black Harry, the horse-shooter, stood on
the top rail. He had shot fifteen hundred horses in those hills for
their hides and tails, and by mistake potted one of old Tom
Saunders's brood-mares, only old Tom did not take that view of it.
Harry had consequently done a term of two years, which did not
increase his popularity with the Farquharsons, whose poor relation
he was. Poole was taken teaching Corroboree to lead, a part of his
education which had been overlooked.</p>

<p>He had put in the morning on the job. "Come, I'll give you a
wrinkle," he said to Flash Billy, who obeyed sulkily. "Look out for
that trick business&mdash;it won't do your reputation any good,
unless you think of joining a circus."</p>

<p>Flash Billy made no reply then, but observed to his associates
later, "Damned silly ole molly-coddle&mdash;you'd think he was
trainin' cows. Gone clean barmy in his ole days."</p>

<p>Lucy Saunders joined Milly to watch Poole with the colt.</p>

<p>"Mother, can't I go home with Uncle Bert and Romp? He says I
can."</p>

<p>"You are getting too big now to be bothering Uncle Bert."</p>

<p>Milly was no blood relation to Poole. When a toddler she had
fought with Marcia Mazere at Three Rivers for the right to sit on
his knee. When told that she must give place because Marcia was his
real niece Milly had acted so like convulsions that Herbert Poole,
J.P., restored her to normality by adopting her as one of his
complete nieces and taking her on the right knee; Marcia refused to
surrender her hereditary right to the left. Though Milly was long
past tantrums, her affection for her Uncle Bert increased rather
than diminished. Famous horseman that he was, he took delight in
her equestrian promise, while he to the child was a lucky-bag that
had yielded such booty as Lady Lochinvar, Romp, and a saddle and
bridle.</p>

<p>"She'd be no trouble, Lucy, if you'd like to let her come. Ma
will enjoy supervising her lessons, and if she gets tired of her
she could go to Ada for a change."</p>

<p>"How would she get home again?"</p>

<p>"Pooh! I could come by myself if I'd only be let. Tell you what.
Couldn't Uncle Bert take me down to see Aileen at Neangen and Uncle
Jack could bring me home from there? I heard him telling Aileen
that he had business that way."</p>

<p>"You could get home easy enough," said SP-over-J, to stop
further overhearings.</p>

<p>"Goody! I'll pack my valise. Couldn't I ride Romp?"</p>

<p>"She and the colt are a bit too green. We don't want to
dishearten them at the beginning. You better stick to old
Ready-money."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>Quite a party left Ten Creeks at sunrise on a glorious morning
at the close of the muster. Young Lindsey, Poole's man, had charge
of the Curradoobidgee strays, and Teddy O'Mara, accompanied by his
redoubtable thieves, was lending him a hand. Poole and Milly rode
behind them, Poole leading Corroboree, who followed with the
eagerness of a neophyte while Milly had Romp trotting amicably
beside Readymoney.</p>

<p>Larry Healey and Ronald Dice joined forces to take their
contingent, and, since they had Aily with them but no stockman,
SP-over-J remarked, "I'll give you a hand till you get a
start."</p>

<p>"You needn't bother, Mr Stanton, unless you like," said Tommy
Roper with a wink at Tim Porter. "I'm making their way and can kill
two birds with the one stone."</p>

<p>"I want to see what the dingo-trappers are after out by
Wamgambril, in any case," said Stanton. Tim returned Tommy's
wink.</p>

<p>It worked out that the young men careered round the loose
horses, and Stanton rode with Aileen, who was pretty, ever so
pretty, and alluringly young. She was also deferential and
unfailingly agreeable. It was dawning on her that there was more
than banter in what people said of her and Stanton, though she did
not take it seriously. Ronald was delightful in his disparagement
of an older rival as "gran'pa" and "uncle".</p>

<p>"You be careful," he rode up and whispered to her as they were
splashing into the home paddock creek. "It's dangerous to an
elderly gosling like that to become lovesick. He might take a fit
and you be blamed." The crude wit convulsed the simple Aileen.</p>

<p>The riders kept together till the river crossing where Boundary
Creek joined the larger stream. Here Poole branched off to the
south and the others continued towards Wamgambril Flats. Milly had
the last words:</p>

<p>"You'll come to Neangen for me, won't you, Uncle? You'll have me
there, won't you, Aileen? If it's too much trouble for Uncle Jack
to go all the way I can easily get down to Stanton's Plains with
Ronnie. You're sure to be going to Neangen, aren't you,
Ronnie?"</p>

<p>To these suggestions Aileen cordially assented. Ronnie, with a
grin at Aileen, also agreed. Uncle Jack intercepted the wink that
Tommy Roper threw at Dice and said to Milly, "You get down to
Neangen and let me know and I'll collect you from there without
troubling anyone."</p>

<p>The Bool Bool contingent remained on the left bank of the
Coolgarbilli while the others clattered and splashed among the
boulders of the stream transparent as glass rushing onward to the
Murrumbidgee. Poole watched them go in a meditative frame of mind.
Thirty years ago he and old Jack Stanton had ridden away on similar
expeditions with the aunts of Aileen and Milly's generation, and
just as gaily as young Dice today, "cut out" rivals and jockeyed
for first place. Clearly in the glass of memory stood two girls
that were dead&mdash;one claimed by cramp in the treacherous
Mungee, the other a victim of a confined life in old-world sunless
damp&mdash;those whom the hands had discussed round the hut fire in
the evenings. All the actors in the drama of the previous
generation insisted that both these beautiful young women had loved
him, Herbert Poole, to the exclusion of all others till the
end.</p>

<p>Ah, well, it was all past now, or rather, as he noted the
blushes wreathing Aily's delicate cheeks when Ronnie made some
remark, it was only the players that changed in the eternal
tourney. He enjoyed life as much as ever and found himself more
careful to preserve it than he had been thirty or forty years ago,
but something had gone out of it. What would he not give to feel
again the delight and excitement that once bubbled in his veins!
There were plenty of old chaps who still chased the "properties" of
youthful joy more greedily than did the young. There was old Jack
squinting at little Aily Healey.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, there is nothing in it. I'm getting as bad as the old
gossips," he thought. They had been connecting himself and Jack
with every eligible and ineligible woman in the district for the
last thirty years and would be at the game for the next thirty, by
the look of things. If it amused small minds, it did no harm to him
and Jack.</p>

<p>As they lost sight of the others among the tall timber and dense
shrubs, Poole looked at the bright face of his companion with its
button nose and freckles, the hat elasticked under the round
childish chin, and the long pigtail aft, and his eyes softened with
indulgence. Bless the youngster, a man could never have the
mulligrubs while she was about! He reflected with satisfaction that
a man was never too old for the affectionate joys provided by the
avuncular relationship. There had been a successive crop of such
nieces, some of them expanding matrons now, but all retaining their
affection for Uncle Bert.</p>

<p>"Do you think goanna fat mixed with wombat grease would take the
freckles off your nose, Milly?"</p>

<p>"It might be as good as those recipes they have for making
straight hair curly," laughed the little girl. "My freckles go away
in the winter, or if I stay inside, but I'd rather be outside."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose we must bear up under the freckles." His eye
wandered to Romp, of a beauty to delight Abd-el-Kader, son of
Mahi-ed-Din himself, and probably better topped through her
thoroughbred English strain than any ewe-necked prodigy that ever
carried the great emir. "Think we can make something of the roan
mongrel?"</p>

<p>Milly responded with a toothsome grin of understanding: she and
Uncle Bert were mates. She was being permitted this as her last
tomboy expedition. Upon her return she was to be tutored by Mr
Blenkinsop, who had gallantly yielded to importunities to undertake
the responsibility for the remainder of the summer at Ten Creeks,
and later at Turrill Turrill for the winter, depending on how they
progressed.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Dice's company parted from Stanton at the head of the
Wamgambril, a sister stream of the Coolgarbilli, which took an
opposite course to reach old Mother of Waters.</p>

<p>"We'll put up for the night at The Gap and get Mrs Tim and young
Tim to give us some songs," suggested Dice, a sociable fellow.</p>

<p>"I must push on," said Larry.</p>

<p>"You and Tommy can push on with the horses at daybreak. I'll see
that Aily gets to Neangen in good condition. What do you say,
Aily?"</p>

<p>"Whatever you and Larry do will suit me," said she, with a rosy
smile.</p>

<p>As young Celia Brennan could sing like a thrush and was pretty
to boot, Larry fell in with this suggestion after hesitation. As
Tommy Roper was inordinately curious and had time on his hands he
fell in with Larry.</p>

<p>Next morning Larry got away at daybreak. Dice at a more
leisurely hour set off with Aileen. He decided to go by Bool Bool
and have lunch with old Mrs Mazere at Three Rivers&mdash;the old
lady was his great-aunt. He enlisted Tommy Roper to deliver the
spare nags at Bookaledgeree.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Larry reached home in time for midday dinner, and in response to
his father's inquiry said, "I left Aileen at The Gap to come on
with Ronald Dice."</p>

<p>"And what the devil did you do that for? If she hasn't any more
sense to look after her reputation, what were you there for?'</p>

<p>"Ronnie's not dangerous," ventured Larry, jun., "and if he was,
Tommy Roper is there to keep a sharp eye on him."</p>

<p>"If she's not showing by two o'clock, you'll go back after
her."</p>

<p>Mrs Healey began to worry as soon as the stipulated hour was
reached. Her husband was an unamiable old scrub and she the
chopping-block of his displeasures. Three o'clock and five passed
without Aileen. Mr Healey waxed ferocious; Mrs Healey was in a
stew.</p>

<p>"Her to be capering about the country like a streel and her
character gone to the winds," he raged. "I'll turn her out! For two
pins she needn't darken my doors again."</p>

<p>"There needn't be such a mighty dust about that," young Larry
was game to say. "Ron Dice would be glad to have her darken
his."</p>

<p>"Him with not a penny to his name; a waster ridin' about the
country after every bit of rag in the world, and the place pin' to
the dingoes and briars, and mortgaged up to the neck."</p>

<p>"Well, if he can't put up enough spondulics to suit you, old
Jack Stanton wouldn't mind relieving you of her, unless I'm more
green than I'm cabbage-looking. You'll have no trouble getting
Aileen off your hands; it's Joanna and Norah will be the tussle,"
said their brother ungallantly.</p>

<p>"What evidence have you of that?"</p>

<p>"Old Skinny Guts was leering at her all the muster like a sick
dog at a firestick. He actually danced with her and came all the
way to Wamgambril huts&mdash;pretended he wanted to look at the
dingo-tracks, but he stuck too close to the old chestnut to see
any. It will do him good to be jealous of Dice, will bring him up
to the scratch."</p>

<p>Larry, sen., ceased to rage. Stanton was rich and a swell. The
Stantons of Stanton's Plains were of the earliest pioneers of Bool
Bool, and, with the Mazeres, Pooles, Brennans, etc., ranked as
first families among the squattocracy.</p>

<p>"Be the hokey-pokey!" Healey exulted to his wife. "If this is
true about old Stanton, why there isn't a man from here to Wagga
Wagga half so well-fixed as him&mdash;a cold-blooded cautious
feller as solid as Mount Corroboree. You give Aily a speakin'-to
when she comes home. She doesn't want to be compromising herself
with young Dice if there is anny hope of Stanton. Dice won't have a
stiver to his name when the banks get their share."</p>

<p>"He's such a nice young fellow," said Mrs Healey weakly.</p>

<p>"Nice, nice! You fool! What's the good of nice&mdash;it's the
dough that counts. If a man's as ugly as old King Billy and as
nasty&mdash;sure, he can be as nasty as he likes if he's only rich
enough."</p>

<p>A woman of spirit might have said that some were ugly and nasty
without being able to afford it, but Mrs Healey was not a woman of
spirit.</p>

<p>Aileen did not reach home till seven o'clock. In addition to
Ronald she was accompanied by his sister, Ida, which took the wind
out of Healey's grizzle about the proprieties. Ida was a dashing
girl with the Dice charm, capable of making herself agreeable even
to old Larry, so that he could not erupt while the Dices were
present, and he remarked as they went on their way in the
moonlight, "'Tis a pity the Dices have no ability to hold money.
She'd make a nice pair with Larry, though he would be better fixed
up at The Gap. Old Tim must be a pretty warm man by now with that
good property on both sides of the river."</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Larry, sen., was neither rich nor nice, nor yet happy nor
beautiful. He was the second son of his family, which had gone up
in the social scale like a rocket, but the second generation showed
no ability to hold or improve what had been gained.</p>

<p>The first Larry and his wife, Aileen, had settled on Monaro
among the earliest pioneers. They had tabled themselves as Irish
immigrants and were reticent about their past. They were neighbours
of the original Poole. By assiduity and disregard of scruples they
had secured a good estate. The old days had been enlivened by a
rumour that a squatter&mdash;some said about Goulburn&mdash;had
gained his wife by a roistering bet, but none were sure of the
man's identity. This story had been fastened on the Healeys in a
dramatic manner in the fifties by a bushranger who subsequently
died in Berrima jail. On the historic occasion while he held up the
whole gallimaufry of first families at a ball at Gowandale he had
audaciously claimed Mrs Healey as his wife in full hearing of the
company, thus casting the aspersion of illegitimacy upon the whole
boiling of young Healeys. The Healeys carried this off as best they
could, and it had been taken as wild clash. Nevertheless it had
disintegrating results upon the morale of the Healeys. The boys in
altercations would be insulted as bastards, and old Healey had had
to divulge that it was better for his sons to lie low and take the
allegations as lightly as possible rather than stir up the mud of
"thrubble".</p>

<p>"Sure, if ye keep quiet it will dhrop, an' there's those that
niver want to stir it up. M'Eachern of Gowandale for one, his son
bein' married to the bushranger's daughter, an' her yer
half-sister, an' there's others. Sure, they're not all married on
legitimate daughters of the nobility."</p>

<p>The dearth of maids in that region and generation had made it
necessary for the most pretentious to marry a shepherd lass or a
<i>fille de joie</i> or go unwed. But to be compelled to turn the
other cheek because they could not batter the other fellow's nose
was as bitter as the milk of seeding lettuce to the belligerent
young Healeys. It curbed their dash and crumpled their
<i>amour-propre</i>.</p>

<p>Dennis, Larry of Neangen's elder brother, had reigned for a time
on Eueurunda, which the Healeys had acquired by planting dummies on
Simon Labosseer while he was disabled and so that his wife had had
to retreat to Coolooluk. The wife of Dennis, a barmaid from
Goulburn, was used to wine and spirits, and Dennis, always that way
inclined, grew too fond of his drop. As he reached middle age he
was a loud, fast man and many women had too many charms for
him.</p>

<p>There were rumours of more bastards than his father's. It was
the grandfather of one of these who met Dennis one night and nearly
finished him. The task failed only because Dennis, like a carpet
snake, recovered after being left for dead. He denied that he and
old Lindsey, the selector, had met in the dark of the moon where
Poole's Creek runs with a velvety Monaro song to join the
Eueurunda. It was through old Lindsey that the story got
abroad.</p>

<p>The district knew that Jenny Lindsey had gone wrong. The
distraught young woman had prevailed upon her destroyer for one
more interview. At this, old Lindsey, acting sleuth, had punished
the guilty with violence. He then rode madly to Braminderra, a
one-pub township where there was also a constable and lock-up, and
had given himself in charge. The constable did not know whether to
believe him or not, so cursed him and kept him till daylight, when
he rode abroad to collect the evidence. Constable Pigeon was of
comfortable form and mind and the scene of the murder was
twenty-five miles distant.</p>

<p>Lindsey was unable to produce the corpse. "Here's where I waited
for him," he insisted. Tracks confirmed this. "Here's where I drug
the &mdash;&mdash; ole scoundrel and swindler and bastard
horse-thief from his saddle. When I got through bashing him I flung
him down the side there." There was a mark as of a sack dragged
across the track and broken sage-bushes, but no sign of Healey.</p>

<p>"You've evidently got 'em," said the constable. "But I'll keep
you in custody till I see Mr Healey."</p>

<p>They had gone off towards Eueurunda, calling at Curradoobidgee
for refreshments. Here the constable found the vehicle of the
doctor from Cooma and Mrs Healey's carriage. Poole on coming home
the night before had heard groans from below the level of the road.
Search had shown Dennis Healey held on the side of the declivity by
the sage-bushes and bracken. Healey was unable to move or speak.
Poole returned to the homestead for assistance. Messengers had also
gone forthwith for Mrs Healey and the doctor. The state of Healey
was that while there is life there is hope, so the constable
credited Lindsey's story and took him away with him.</p>

<p>As soon as he was able to make a deposition, Healey asserted
that he had been riding a fresh horse, which, startled by a snake,
had unseated him. His foot stuck in the stirrup and this accounted
for the terrible battering he had received. A thunderstorm late the
day following the affray made further reference to the tracks
impossible. Lindsey had been released.</p>

<p>Healey never mounted a horse again. His wife met the catastrophe
by getting rid of the station and taking a hotel in Goulburn. She
was tired of station life. She was no rider, and had not been
accepted by the squattocracy as she had hoped. The Pooles and
M'Eacherns held aloof because she had not been congenial to them,
and also they resented the way Dennis had treated an old friend and
neighbour.</p>

<p>Larry, the second brother, transferred to Eueurunda, but ill
luck attended him too. His wife died. His eldest son was shot dead
cleaning a rifle. The Healeys had paid too much for Eueurunda in
the first place, and bad management, bad seasons, and disease in
the flocks forced Larry to cut his losses and move to Neangen.
Another wife and family had succeeded the first, but life seemed to
sour on Larry. He was an ill-tempered failure, feeling that God and
man were against him. The old Healeys had seceded from "the wan
thrue Church", owing, it was said, to a row with the hierarchy
regarding their marriage or lack of it, and the consequence was
that the Healeys of the second generation had no religion as a
buttress of respectability.</p>

<p>Such were Aileen's antecedents at the time of the muster at Ten
Creeks Run. Debts and minor distresses were the family's portion at
Neangen. The girls hoped for marriage as a way of mending their
fortunes, but the two of the first marriage were as plain as
kitchen aprons and without style, while Aileen lacked head to
market herself, and the family were alert to prevent their best ewe
lamb from throwing herself away.</p>

<p>The news about old Stanton was hopeful. Not only was he rich but
he had standing, and most of the higher squattocracy now ignored
the Healeys unless they needed a night's lodging when business led
them past Neangen.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Stanton turned back from Wamgambril Flats where the lone
selection of his dummy secured the eye of a mountainous horse and
cattle run. He retraced his way across creeks and ferny gullies
through the cool depths of thousands of square miles of timber
broken only by the tiny spring-head flats of the plateaux amid the
ranges. There were tucker and tea in his saddle-bags of calfskin,
and a quart pot on the D. He went steadily and mused on the draft
of colts and fillies, and what he might net from his wool on
Turrill Turrill, but most of all he thought of Aileen Healey and
felt young again. A reawakening zest in life was throwing a magic
veil over things once more.</p>

<p>Many men older than he took unto themselves wives. It was not as
if Aileen were a child. She had come of age this year or two. He
could set her off in a way that none of her other admirers could
approach. Lucy might think him a fool, though she was not situated
to say what she really thought to any devastating extent. Why the
deuce couldn't she pull it off with Bert? That would leave him,
Jack, free and give him an excuse for marriage which a confirmed
bachelor so well catered for lacked. It would do old Bert a world
of good to get married, but SP-over-J did not believe he had the
red blood in him these days. SP-over-J chuckled in the elation of
the resurgence of his own blood.</p>

<p>A day or two later he announced his intention of running into
Bool Bool to sign some papers. Arrived in the little town he rode
to the saddler's and gave a satisfactory order for gear including a
smart pair of leggings. Next he called at the house adjacent to the
bank, the windows of which announced A. A. RANKIN &amp; SON,
SOLICITORS. It was the son, a pleasant man in the forties, that
received Stanton.</p>

<p>"Well, Jack, what can I do for you today? How's the horse
market?"</p>

<p>"Fair to middling. How're yourself and Fannie?"</p>

<p>"Fine, thanks."</p>

<p>"How are things financially&mdash;everyone paid up and
independent, or is there a mortgage or two kicking round?"</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact there are a couple going begging, but
nothing juicy."</p>

<p>"Do you mind telling me what they are?"</p>

<p>"Old Larry Healey is trying to raise something more on that
dingo-run he has at Neangen, and the Dices want a covering mortgage
on Bookaledgeree."</p>

<p>"Who has it now?"</p>

<p>"Tom Saunders."</p>

<p>"Is he foreclosing?"</p>

<p>"No, but the Dices probably want to get out of his
clutches."</p>

<p>"Bookaledgeree is a wilderness of briars&mdash;cost more than
it's worth&mdash;tears all the wool off the sheep's backs. Neangen
would be better for horses."</p>

<p>"I can get you the bank's valuation."</p>

<p>"I want to work through the bank, if you'll fix it up privately.
When I have money going, I like to put it in the old district."</p>

<p>"The right spirit, Jack. If more had it the place would progress
more rapidly."</p>

<p>Details of the mortgages on Neangen and Bookaledgeree were
followed by gossipy chat about people, no taint of ideas on either
side, then Stanton withdrew till next day. Two days later he rode
home with a feeling of accomplishment. His next move was to
complain to his sister that Milly was running wild. He gave
instructions for a letter to Poole stating that if he brought Milly
as far as Neangen, he, Stanton, would go there to meet her, since
he had to go in that direction to inspect horses that were for
sale.</p>

<p>The official opening of the new bridge was not far off, so Poole
wrote to Mrs Saunders that he would bring Milly to the festival.
Stanton could not be too fussy, but not to be robbed of his excuse
for going to Neangen he set out to inspect horses as originally
planned. He was spruce as to horse and gear. He was wearing a new
hat and had trimmed his beard in the fashionable Prince of Wales
clip. He would have liked to shave it off, but for the present
lacked the assurance for such an innovation.</p>

<p>By some miscalculation, as he said, he got to Neangen in advance
of Milly. "Can you suffer me an extra day?" he inquired of
Aileen.</p>

<p>Milly and her Uncle Bert arrived next day, Milly riding Romp,
the exquisite galloway, now of perfect manners.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p>The most interesting public event for a year round Bool Bool was
to be the opening of the new bridge. The punt that had carried the
main street across the Yarrabongo to join the Great Southern Road
from Sydney to Melbourne had in the late sixties been replaced by a
wooden erection. This structure in turn had given way to a bridge
with ornamental arches painted white, the pride of the inhabitants,
and the New Crossing on the edge of Stanton's Plains had been
furnished with a punt. It was this punt, which in the course of
progress was being superseded by a second bridge, that Lewis
Mortimer, the local M.P., had bagged for his electorate. Mortimer
had been invited to open it, but the old warrior was more renowned
for his tact than his oratory. Old Mrs Mazere, the oldest pioneer
and chief of the chief clan of the district, should open the
bridge, while he made a speech about the wonders of the valley and
the intelligent progressive spirit of the constituents whom he had
the honour to represent.</p>

<p>The celebration coincided with Mrs Mazere's seventy-eighth
birthday, and the double event was bringing people from a wide
radius. The bridge was to be opened in the morning and clinched by
a banquet, the evening to be given to a grand subscription ball and
supper. The Rev. Archdeacon Fish and the Rev. Father O'Halloran
were both patrons of this. Tickets were a guinea each, proceeds to
be divided between the local hospital and the Anglican and Roman
Catholic churches. Considering the good cause, old Mrs Mazere had
consented to open the ball. The subject put the price of wool and
maize and cattle and horses in the shade for a day or two and
temporarily eclipsed local scandals, only to germinate a fresh
crop.</p>

<p>When Milly arrived at Neangen, Julie, her immediate contemporary
among the young Healeys, pleaded for her to remain the intervening
nights instead of proceeding to Bool Bool. This suited SP-over-J,
and Poole, always of placid mind, thought it better not to add to
the household of Three Rivers while preparations were raging.</p>

<p>"There's been a great struggle to get Great-grandma Mazere
rigged up for the shivoo. Fannie sent to Sydney to get Rhoda to
choose a new bonnet, but Great-grandma jibbed at it. It's been
picked to pieces two or three times and made look as nearly like
the old one as possible, the one she took to when old Mr Mazere
died," said Joanna.</p>

<p>"Old Bill Prendergast is coming from Gundagai to drive her over
the bridge to open it with his grey four-in-hand, and they've got
about an acre of tents put up for the banquet," added Larry,
jun.</p>

<p>Uncle Jack felt convicted of family dereliction to be cavorting
with the Healeys, and to have Milly and Poole there with him while
his sister was away back at Ten Creeks. As a compromise he sent
Tommy Roper to fetch her, coupled with the courtesy of announcing
that he and Milly and Poole would be coming together.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Thus when the big day dawned the Healeys had the honour of Poole
and Jack Stanton as their escorts. Larry, sen., wife, Joanna, and
small fry filled the shabby buggy drawn by a pair of long-tailed
horses. Young Larry, Alf Timson, and Norah galloped away from their
dust on horseback.</p>

<p>Poole was surprised that Stanton should appear on such an
occasion with the Healeys instead of with his own people from the
Plains. He knew it would be unpleasant for Lucy Saunders to have
Milly in that company, and he felt he owed it to the child to stay
with her. "Old Jack must be fairly collared," he mused, looking on.
"Old fool, at his time of life! The little girl is sweet and
pretty, but weak&mdash;the breed is lacking&mdash;an old fool with
a young wife is as bad a team as a Clydesdale yoked to a
sprinter."</p>

<p>Milly and Julie capered round Uncle Bert, but Julie's old Neddy
was outclassed by the incomparable Romp, groomed till her hide was
like polished granite, richly caparisoned and with smartly hogged
mane and tail. The little girls amused themselves counting the
snake-tracks in the soft dust, counting the goannas that ran up the
trees and looked at them, counting Tommy Roper's dead beasts or
Riverina dead sheep, counting anything that made a game.</p>

<p>Aileen, a picture of slender grace in a new habit on her easy
old chestnut, Miss Muffet, was attended by Uncle Jack on a showy
four-year-old. Movement was to be seen as they turned out of the
timber on the Neangen road and came in view of the iron roof of
Bookaledgeree among its bower of fruit and ornamental trees, with
the cleared mile between the homestead and main road.</p>

<p>Milly looked for her friend Ronald to put the right valuation on
Romp's excellencies. Milly was a wholesome young thing still
mentally undisturbed by her budding womanhood. Ronald was her chum
and admirer; that she might be an intruder had not yet occurred to
her. Julie, not of such wholesome mind and absorption, watched for
Ronald with an excitement born of words overheard.</p>

<p>As the Bookaledgeree party grew clearer, Aileen's heart
fluttered deliciously to recognize Ronald with his sisters Ida and
Olive. Mrs Dice and younger members of the family followed in the
buggy. Old Dice had been dead some years. Mrs Dice had been Jane
Freeborn, daughter of old Mrs Mazere's brother Matthew.</p>

<p>The Dices reached the public road as the Neangen riders neared.
Notice of Milly's prodigy could not be omitted. Ronald, while
giving this, employed a stratagem to get Aileen, and left Jack
Stanton and Poole with Olive and Ida, who made themselves
excessively agreeable. Milly was floored by the defection of
Ronald, but he was speedily topping the next ridge with Aileen on
her silly old chestnut, which everyone was agreed was only fit for
dingo baits. Something in the air checked Milly's impulse to
overtake them: she had to be content with the admiration won by
Romp from every other traveller.</p>

<p>"Look, Ma, Aileen has galloped away from Mr Stanton with Ron
Dice," observed Julie, riding close to her parents' shandrydan to
whisper sententiously.</p>

<p>"I'm not blind," replied Mrs Healey.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, and ride away or you'll get the horse's foot
between the spokes," said her father roughly.</p>

<p>The day, one of the hottest of the season, had started
auspiciously with a sharp thunder-shower that left the air clear
and sparkling and laid the dust, so deep on the rich river flats
that if disturbed it could be so dense as to cause collisions. The
organizing committee had arranged a procession to approach by way
of the right bank and cross the new bridge. Terence M'Haffety,
butcher in the old days and later landlord of the Royal Hotel, was
Mayor that year, and a fine hearty father of the township he
proved, always ready to put colour and dash into his functioning.
For the bridge affair he had an energetic coadjutor in his old
colleague, Prendergast, another publican from Gundagai, and in the
old days "Cornstalk Bill", redoubtable coach-driver. He ran the
best hotel in Gundagai, and in the beginning had owned several of
the subsidiary lines of coaches later swallowed by the world-wide
Cobb &amp; Co.</p>

<p>Prendergast was a coaching authority, and had driven six-in-hand
before the Governor in Sydney. He was unhappy away from coaches and
horses, and after retiring to be host of the Cornstalk Arms, had
returned to the road for his health. In her widowed years old Mrs
Mazere made visits to her son Hugh, beyond Cootamundra, and always
arranged her journeys for the days when William, as she addressed
him, was driving. He was unfailingly delighted to have her. On such
occasions the box-seat was sacred to her, and he put extra dash
into his driving for her appreciation. There she enjoyed his skill
with four or five coachers, which like as not of late years bore
the Jinninjinninbong or Ten Creeks brands on their hides. Mrs Bill,
or "Squinty Ellen" of earlier years, had been reared in the Three
Rivers kitchen, and the pair treated the old lady as a State guest
and dined with her in a private sitting-room.</p>

<p>It was now two or three years since she had gone to Cootamundra;
time and rheumatics were restricting her activities. The appearance
for the bridge was in the family sociable. The coach had had to be
abandoned because the box-seat was now too high for the old lady to
reach with comfort. Mr and Mrs Prendergast arrived the clay before
with the four-in-hand of iron-greys, driven at a rattling bat to
steady them for the procession.</p>

<p>The ceremony was timed for 11.30. About an hour earlier there
was a muster at Three Rivers. The Mayor and Mayoress were to go
first, followed by Mortimer, M.P., and his wife, and then Mrs
Mazere, decked in new black silk and the adapted Sydney bonnet. Her
grandson Philip lifted her up beside Prendergast. The seat held
three, so Mrs Prendergast had the honour of sitting beside the
great lady. In the back were Mr and Mrs Philip Mazere and Mr and
Mrs Jacob Isaacs and Mrs Rachel Labosseer and Emily. After this
came Archdeacon Fish and Father O'Halloran, the banker, the
lawyers, other business and professional people, and numerous old
pioneers.</p>

<p>The procession turned upstream to the new bridge, and those
assembled cheered its arrival. Mrs Mazere nodded and smiled under a
tricky little parasol in acknowledgment; several rushed to the
bit-rings while Bert Poole helped his old friend to alight. It was
his arm she leant upon to stand with the Member, the Mayor, and
clergy. It was an honour accorded Poole and in sentimental favour
since long ago he had been engaged to lovely Emily Mazere, drowned
just after her engagement to him had been announced. A little
Brennan girl came forward with a bunch of roses. Mrs Mazere took
them, kissed the child, and handed the flowers to her eldest
great-granddaughter, Marcia, who was lady-in-waiting. The Mayor
presented the gold scissors and Mrs Mazere cut the ribbon and
smashed the bottle of champagne with a few baptismal, God-fearing
words. Poole lifted her back to her seat and the hard-banded hoofs
of the coachers made imposing thunder on the decking of the new
structure as amid prolonged cheering they crossed it. Then amid
handshakings and greetings and congratulations to the banquet in
the marquee at which Mrs Mazere sat at the top of the chief table
with the Mayor and Member on either side, and an exchange in wives
on either side of them, and so on.</p>

<p>There were those who early were not so happy as might have been.
One was Flash Billy in his strapped trousers and cabbage-tree
forgathering among his kind on the outskirts.</p>

<p>"Did yous see ole Poole ridin' the Corroboree colt, an' him
actin' as tame as ole Flea Creek with a couple of hundred of salt
on him?" inquired Long Billy, joining him. "It seems he wasn't no
outlaw after all."</p>

<p>"Hell!" said Flash Billy. "You know a terrible lot, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, shut your gob, you&mdash;. I've bitten me tongue."</p>

<p>"Did yous twig young Aileen and Ronnie with their horses
sweatin', an' a long way behind them ole Skinny Guts stuck with
Olive and Ider? Ron cut out the old bloke at Bookaledgeree." This
from Tim Porter.</p>

<p>"The reel fun," said Tommy Roper, "was the missus when I come
an' told her the boss was stayin' with the Healeys and she had to
come on her own."</p>

<p>"An' young Milly," contributed Jerry Riddall. "You should er
seen her ridin' up on the Young Whisker filly as simple as if it
wuz the ole mare. What do yer make o' that, Billy?"</p>

<p>"The &mdash;&mdash; fillies 'll let women an' lunatics ride 'en
every time, that's well known, ain't it? Ain't you heard ole
know-all Mick Muldoon skitin' about it, blast you, as well as Mr
Eustace Lord Muck the Earl of Blenkinsop?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but Poole an' Corroboree ain't no lunatic nor ole woman
neither."</p>

<p>"If you ask me, I think his brain is softenin' an' he is
becomin' an ole woman, an' the horse knows it."</p>

<p>"My cripes, I don't know when I've laughed so much," said Tommy
Roper. "There was the missus drivin' with ole Dan Spires sittin' up
with her like an ole cluckin' hen. Good iron wingey, she was
pleased!"</p>

<p>She certainly had been in Roper's ironic sense. Arrived at the
bridge she sprang straight over the wheel to express her
displeasure to her brother.</p>

<p>"I expected you at Stanton's Plains last night to come with me
in the procession," she said.</p>

<p>"You can drive as well as I can."</p>

<p>"I can drive better for that matter, but where on earth were
you?"</p>

<p>"At Neangen. I sent you word."</p>

<p>"Among that crowd! It is foolish to encourage such people. I
won't have Milly getting familiar with them. They ought to be
ashamed of themselves to appear on an occasion like this!"</p>

<p>"Great snakes, it's a public function and the bridge will be of
more use to them than anyone."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it's a Mazere and Stanton and all our crowd's affair,
and considering what old Denny Healey did to the Labosseers about
Eueurunda I consider&mdash;"</p>

<p>Milly interrupted by rushing up to greet her mother and to
announce that the procession was coming. Mrs Saunders turned
perforce towards the business of the day. Meeting Aileen Healey on
the way to the platform she gave her the curtest of nods, which
covered Aileen with confusion since there had been no coolness
during the muster. Old Larry she refused to recognize at all, and
she recalled Milly sharply from Julie's embrace. Others besides her
brother noted these actions.</p>

<p>The banquet was a tedious function with jellies melting and
blowflies attacking the meats. Many of the younger fraternity stole
away to flirt and gossip in the shade of the big gums along the
river-banks, while the Mayor presided flamboyantly and his wife
supported him like a sunflower. The more platitudinous, flowery,
and distended the speeches the more highly were they esteemed as
gems of oratory and wit, and the bridge, officially christened in
honour of Mortimer who had secured it, was better known as old Mrs
Mazere's.</p>

<p>The old lady was returning to Three Rivers after the banquet to
rest for the evening function. Prendergast's greys stood reefing at
the bits, with eager volunteers holding the rings. Charlotte, wife
of old Mrs Mazere's eldest son, went with her and persuaded her
husband to go too, to be out of the way of the drinking. Young
Mazeres or Stantons or Labosseers filled up the back for the ride
in the chariot of honour, and because one place is as good as and
occasionally better than another to the infatuated. Beside her
mother went Mrs Rachel Labosseer of Coolooluk, Mrs Mazere's widowed
daughter. It was against her husband that the Healeys had employed
dummies to obtain Eueurunda, the Monaro station on which the
Healeys never throve.</p>

<p>On the contrary, Mrs Labosseer had since prospered and was
honoured second only to her mother. Now a handsome woman in the
fifties, she was surrounded by sons that were paragons and
daughters that were accounted perfect. Her ringing laugh could be
heard as Poole assisted her into the sociable and said something
about engaging her for a polka at the ball.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Herbert, did mamma ever dance?" exclaimed Emily in
surprise. All of the Mazere clan called Poole uncle because of his
engagement to their beautiful Aunt Emily.</p>

<p>"Your mamma could dance better than any girl I know when she was
your age. She once gave me lessons."</p>

<p>"Mamma, you never let us dance at all! I thought you did not
believe in it."</p>

<p>"Because I did certain things when I was young and wicked is no
reason I should countenance wickedness now," said mamma, with the
finality which distinguished all her pronouncements on matters of
conduct for her family.</p>

<p>The volunteers let go, the greys bounded away; no one missed the
fine sweep of them up the approach to the bridge and as they lilted
round the edge of Stanton's Plains by the way they had come.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Terence M'Haffety, who had a prominent place in the
departure. "Sure, they're all roight in their way, but the bist Oi
iver saw was ould Poole, the dad of Bert here, swhinging five bays
up through the town there, ivery wan of thim on their hoind legs,
an' his missus with a baby in her arms sittin' there unconscious as
if 'twas a perambulathor! There was a man for ye!"</p>

<p>"You should not have mentioned that," said Isaacs, drawing him
aside. "That was the time old Poole came to the twenty-first
birthday ball of Emily, and she was drownded just after."</p>

<p>"Maybe Oi shouldn't have, Jacob. Poor ould Mrs Mazere, gettin'
very whoite. The last of the rale ould wans left. Not another of
the originals left of the first whoites on the Yarrabongo. All the
ould Saunderses and Stantons and Brennans with their wives in the
cimitery this sivin years or more. Sure, whin the ould lady is
gone, Jacob, it's me and you next."</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>"This makes me feel young again, William," remarked Mrs Mazere,
when the horses had settled down on the level plains. She had
enjoyed the outing and reception. "It reminds me of the days I used
to go riding over the mountains to Monaro and thought nothing of
it."</p>

<p>"You must come with me to Gundagai one of these days. It is too
long since you came our way."</p>

<p>"I expect I shall not take many more runs till I go to rest
beside Papa in the hollow," she remarked, but not gloomily. "If the
Lord spares you to my age, William, you'll know that it is a lonely
condition&mdash;not one left of my own age for me to talk to about
the things we knew."</p>

<p>"I never thought of that before, Mrs Mazere. It will be dashed
lonely for some of us to be without you when the time comes. Now
ain't those leaders pearls!" he observed to divert her. "I'd like
to be driving them for a wedding couple, the next best thing after
this here today."</p>

<p>"There will be plenty of weddings about presently, with so many
young people. I cannot remember who they all are...I'd like you to
drive me at my funeral, William," she added.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be blowed, Mrs Mazere, for you to think of such a
dull thing on this happy day! You're good for another ten or twenty
years yet, I'm hanged if you're not! You'll very likely be at my
funeral first."</p>

<p>"And I hope everyone will come to my funeral&mdash;all the women
and girls as well as the men, and say a last good-bye to me. I have
known so many of them since they were born, since before they were
born, so to speak, and I pray to meet them hereafter."</p>

<p>She had insisted upon attending Emily's funeral long ago against
the usual custom for women, and all her women friends had supported
her on that tragic occasion. She had continued the practice of
seeing all her friends to the grave. In the case of old Tim Brennan
of The Gap, and one or two others, Prendergast recalled that she
had been the only member of her sex to pay the departed this last
courtesy.</p>

<p>On sped the greys, nodding their crested heads in the annoyance
of the flies, pulling their burden gaily between the river singing
the G minor Ballade over its great boulders and the fields of
dark-green maize that stretched away to yellowing grasses that
carpeted the foothills of the undenuded mountains where the Gap
known as Brennan's let the Wamgambril through.</p>

<p>"If you drive me on my last journey, William," pursued the old
lady, "I'd like to be driven like this, and not that dismal
creeping pace of funerals."</p>

<p>"Right you are, Mrs Mazere. It shall be as you wish: Mrs
Labosseer can be witness. But I hope I'll be too old to handle the
ribbons by that time."</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>No thought of their end entered the thoughts of others. Poole
headed a committee to arrange impromptu sports. Specially enjoyable
were these to the rising generation, and the half-crowns they won
seemed better prizes and bulked larger than many later honours.</p>

<p>The day was as full of youthful zest and notoriety to Milly as
it was of ripe honour and homage to Great-grandma Mazere. Her pony
was the wonder of all owing to the tricks taught her by Flash
Billy. Mr Mortimer asked for a special exhibition and Milly made
Romp kneel while she mounted, and lie down and pretend to be dead,
and jump a bush held up in full view of Archdeacon Fish and Father
O'Halloran and the assembled squattocracy.</p>

<p>Another notable was Dot Saunders, Milly's cousin, the leading
amateur equestrienne of the district and a belle who had more
admirers than she could use. Riding at one of the up-country shows
last autumn, the Governor, himself a considerable figure <i>a
cheval</i>, had been so delighted with her horsemanship that he
asked her to ride at the Sydney Show. This she had done at Easter,
carrying off everything she entered for. She, too, was requested to
give an exhibition. Hurdles were placed and she entertained the
beholders by her own grace and skill as well as that of her famous
horse, the Princess. She was active and efficient, with hands
strong and quiet, and was good to see in her tight-fitting habit,
and her yellow plaits showing under her billycock hat. She had them
all dithering because of her vitality, and above all for the
egg-boiler cast of her waist, which in those days was equal to a
dowry to a maiden in the marriage arena.</p>

<p>With all the admiration Dot was receiving she saw hardly
anything of Ronald Dice, the only young man present who attracted
her. He and Jack Stanton were increasingly infatuated with Aileen
Healey, and making for her the most exciting and successful day she
had so far experienced. The Dice girls also had a pleasant day
squired intermittently by Poole. There was a sporting chance that
he still could be captured, an idea furthered by the comfort of his
manner.</p>

<p>Dot was a doer, not a dreamer. When SP-over-J secured Aileen's
attention she suggested to Ronald, "What about us riding in the
pairs at the next show in Bool Bool, and at Gundagai too?"</p>

<p>"It would have been ripping, Dot," replied Ronald. "Only I have
just fixed up with Miss Healey."</p>

<p>"I didn't know she could ride." There was in that locality a
gulf between those who could travel on horseback and those who
could disport themselves over hurdles.</p>

<p>"She can do well enough for the pairs," said Ronald with that
instinct for escaping contention that made him popular. "I didn't
dream of looking so high as you, Dot."</p>

<p>"Have you got a horse for Miss Healey?"</p>

<p>"Good enough for the pairs."</p>

<p>"I ought to lend her Susan Nipper, only she takes riding," said
Dot to cover her disappointment, and moved away holding her
new-fashioned habit smartly round her. So daring an innovation
called out observations rooted in admiration and envy. It fitted
like a snake-skin to the waist, and as a special feature was
destitute of gathers to disguise her back contour, and that was
daring for Dot's decade.</p>

<p>She walked straight over to Herbert Poole. "Mr Poole, will you
ride in the pairs with me at the show?"</p>

<p>"I should think that grey of Ronald's would pair better with
your Princess than anything I've got."</p>

<p>"I've asked him, but he's already fixed up with Aileen Healey."
There was a wistful, tired look in the bright sunburnt face, and
Poole with his unfailing kindness said, "All right, Dot, if you
want me to."</p>

<p>Ronald Dice had a word with Aileen at the earliest opportunity.
"I want you to ride with me in the pairs at the show. Don't say no,
for I've already said we are going to."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ronnie, how wonderful! However did you think of it! I don't
believe I can ride well enough."</p>

<p>"Oh yes you can."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Pa won't let me."</p>

<p>"He'll have to. Dot Saunders is always riding at the shows and
she's no end of a swell."</p>

<p>"Yes, but the Governor has praised her, and had her at
Government House."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll take it as settled for a start anyhow, and tell
anyone who asks you for a dance tonight that you are already
engaged."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ronnie, how heavenly!" she breathed, her eyes like
stars.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>The ball was held in the hall at the Agricultural Show grounds,
and a number of the oldest settlers, headed by the Mayor and
Mayoress, the Member and Memberess, the two clergy and their one
spouse, were waiting to welcome old Mrs Mazere when she was driven
up in another black silk dress and a shawl from India, and, instead
of the day bonnet, an expensive widow's cap of similar origin and
modifications. Terence M'Haffety was proud in his office. He was a
man of money and consequence in the town, his wife his able
partner, and it had been long since forgotten that one had convict
beginnings and the other was supposed to have been born in the
"Female Factory" at Parramatta.</p>

<p>Mrs Mazere was overcome by the presentation of a long gold
chain, and an illuminated address signed by the leading townsmen,
setting forth the esteem in which she was held, and wishing her
many more happy returns of the day. She had difficulty in
controlling her voice but her emotion was drowned in cheers of
goodwill. Then followed the opening of the ball by a grand march
round the hall to the music of an imported band, the gift of
M'Haffety for the occasion. Mrs Mazere walked with the Member, the
Mayor walked with the Memberess, the Mayoress walked with
Archdeacon Fish, and Father O'Halloran walked with Mrs Fish, and so
on down to a tail of beaux and belles for whose delectation balls
are really organized. The grand march ended, the old lady returned
to her home, whither she was taken by the men who displaced the
horses and drew her regardless of dust and perspiration.</p>

<p>The entertainment progressed with a dance or two of honour in
which the distinguished visitors and elders joined with cackle and
flourish and then retired comfortably to the rooms improvised in
the wings of the Hall while youthful enjoyment continued
unconfined. The oldsters played cards in their nook, and the real
oldsters of all talked intimately of the old days and speculatively
of the future. Among those taking part were Jacob and Rebecca
Isaacs, the first storekeepers of the town. There were slabs of
human drama acutely interesting to Rebecca.</p>

<p>"Sure, Oi saw with me own eyes Mrs Lucy Saunders walk sniffily
past the gurrul, Aileen, and give the cut direct to ould Larry,"
whispered the Mayor.</p>

<p>"And right, too!" said Browning the carpenter, now of
substantial estate, retired, and an alderman. "Think of the dirty
trick the Healeys played on the Labosseers."</p>

<p>"But what has that got to do with the Stantons?" remarked
Isaacs.</p>

<p>"They bein' all related back and forth, and hangin'
together."</p>

<p>"Aw, it can't be that," persisted Isaacs. "Tommy Roper, the
little feller with the prize jumpers, was in the store the other
day an' tellin' me as how Aileen and her brother was at Ten Creeks
for the muster, so why should Lucy Saunders give them the go-by
now? If we went about giving the go-by because of what some other
family did to our friends some time there'd be no business done at
all."</p>

<p>"Sure, Oi'm tellin' ye Oi saw it."</p>

<p>"But Mrs Labosseer herself spoke to old Larry, I seen her, an'
asked how old Denny was. I listened, because I was goin' to ask,
myself."</p>

<p>"And old Mrs Mazere shook hands with him the same as all the
others," testified Browning.</p>

<p>"Och, now ye've said it!" exclaimed the Mayor. "But there niver
was annyone to ayqual the rale ould Mazeres of Three Rivers. All
these others stickin' on a bit av soide is upstarts. These Saunders
is not half the breed of the ould Mazeres, and that Lucy, the widow
of Saunders, can act loike a mad dog with stinkin' proide if
annyone attimpts to speak to her that she thinks isn't good enough.
Sure, hasn't she acted that way to me! But ould Mrs Mazere was
niver loike that. Av coorse she'd speak to Healey, or if it was a
condimned man she'd speak to him too, just as natural. The rare
lady is the rale Christian, you can know it by that."</p>

<p>"The missus says the trouble is that old Jack Stanton is struck
on the girl Aileen, and you know my missus can always be depended
on for the straight tip."</p>

<p>"My oath, she can that!" said Browning.</p>

<p>"Sure, Lucy Saunders doesn't loike the breed, an' it would put
her nose out of jint to boot. The Healey gurrul won't get anny
assistance there. Sure, now whin Oi think of it, didn't ould Skinny
come with the Healeys, an' Lucy drivin' the four-in-hand herself.
Phwat the divul...Sure, Jacob, things must have gone pretty far
without you havin' the cognizance."</p>

<p>"The cognizance was all right, but things have been as suddent
as greased lightning. It's Lucy who hasn't seen it coming, an' now
it is too late to stop it, is the opinion of my old woman."</p>

<p>"Begor', ye moight as well try to stop a snowball meltin' in
hell whin an ould feller that hasn't been afther the gurruls for
years gets it into his head to want wan. Croipes, wouldn't it be a
lift to ould Larry!"</p>

<p>"As good as a play," agreed Browning, who had risen to watch the
dancers. "Old Skinny is dancing with the Healey piece now this
minute, and Ronald Dice is sitting out with Dot Saunders, and Lucy
is layin' down the law to Poole. She's had her hooks in there long
enough and nothing ever came of it."</p>

<p>"Sure, nothing ever will. He keeps himself natural, being koind
to all the little gurruls and the children. Sure, that little wan
of Lucy Saunders has more chanct with him than anny of the
grownups. An' wasn't she a noice little thing with that pony, loike
a circus! She's betther than her ma. Sure, a case in pint with what
Oi've been sayin', did ye see ould Mrs Mazere with ould Bill
Prendergast? For all he's a successful man now, and a pot on him
loike a mare in foal, sure, don't we remimber him for iver in ould
Mazere's kitchen after Squinty Ellen, his woife. And didn't the
ould lady rare her by hand so to speak, in her own thrue religion,
an' she frinds now with thim without lowerin' herself or thim, an'
none of these airs of excloosiveness like the Saunders and
Stantons&mdash;thinkin' it roises thimselves to keep others
down."</p>

<p>Surely His Worship must have heard that Lucy Saunders said it
was a disgrace to Bool Bool to have an ex-ticket-of-leave as
Mayor.</p>

<p>"Bert Poole is dancing with the little Saunders girl, and Aileen
Healey and Ron Dice have got together at last," reported Isaacs in
his turn. "And they look made for each other, I will say that, and
she lookin' up at him as if she was swimming in paradise. It's a
curious thing, this being in love."</p>

<p>A game ended, the Mayor joined the proprietor of the Royal
Drapery Mart. A mass of young people in ball finery were disporting
themselves to the music of the Mayor's band. The initiated could
pick out dozens of the third generation of Mazeres, Stan-tons,
Saunderses, and Brennans, the original pioneers. Then there were
the later comers and the townspeople proper&mdash;the daughters of
the banker, lawyer, and clergyman, and also the tradespeople, this
being a public ball. There were, too, the Riverina squatters and
their families in the district for the summer. Among them were a
few notable for their beauty or other public qualities. Conspicuous
was Herbert Poole, J.P., youthful-looking for the late fifties,
prosperous, popular, a figure of romance.</p>

<p>"Isn't it a pity," observed Mrs Isaacs to the Mayoress, where
these two looked on from another doorway, "that he doesn't
marry&mdash;him so fond of children. Look at him now with little
Milly, laughing and enjoying himself as much as if she was the
belle."</p>

<p>"Sure, Rebecca, do you think there's anny thruth in Milly's
mother makin' up to him?"</p>

<p>"She'll never catch him. She's too bossy. She ought to take ole
Mr Blenkinsop. He'd be one of those chip-in-porridge ole men that
would just fit in with her tigrinizing. He'd be a nice figurehead,
an' it's awkward for a woman without some sort of a man. Don't the
ole bird look nice tonight?"</p>

<p>"Sure, he's loike the Governor! How do ye suppose it is that his
woife cannot endure him and sint him out here; he seems as meek as
a lamb."</p>

<p>"A man may be a lamb, but there's many things to be considered
in a husband that wouldn't matter in a lawyer or a gardener."</p>

<p>Mr Eustace Blenkinsop was the beau of the ball, being the wearer
of a perfect dress suit, a uniform rare among the men. To Mr
Blenkinsop's mind and education it was indispensable, and he had
the art, ingrained through generations, of wearing it without
offence in any society. He was a remittance-man, one of those
amiable ditherers of whom it is said, "He's no one's enemy but his
own." His perfect manners were only equalled by his perfect
uselessness, and there was no acute alcoholism to account for it.
It was merely his upbringing. As an eldest son in the land of
primogeniture he might have been employed as a figurehead in the
rule of the cliques over the classes; but a younger son of an
indigent branch he was simply one of the unbelievable paradoxes
exported by England to the colonies. He was no Gussie&mdash;also at
that date exported in such numbers as to indicate that the English
system of breeding gentlemen must either have had poor material to
work upon or be most inefficient to produce so many "culls"
patronizing the "beastly colonies" and deploring the life of
Australia as bitterly as their families deplored them. Mr
Blenkinsop enjoyed Australian life. He was the perfection of kindly
content, never guilty of offensive comparisons, and able to meet
members of his own sets, did any appear, with the same
unembarrassed grace with which he associated with the Stantons and
M'Haffetys, the Mazeres, or Mick Muldoon, or Teddy O'Mara. His
allowance, regularly remitted and accompanied by affectionate
letters, was spent on clothes, courtesies, tobacco, and
periodicals. He never needed to pay for board where every door was
open to him and where he never doubted his welcome. He was an
ornament wherever he appeared&mdash;a lily of the field&mdash;so
enamoured of good manners and a mild disposition is humanity at
large. Many had coveted him as a tutor and Mrs Saunders had scored
in having coaxed him to superintend Milly.</p>

<p>He was, as Mrs Isaacs spoke, leading Mrs Lucy Saunders upon the
floor. He could dance as agreeably as he could take a hand at
cards, or chess, or billiards, or supply a classical quotation.</p>

<p>"In the name of all that's sinsible, can ye suggest either wan
of ye whoi ould Mr Blenkinsop is not at home with his family instid
of everlastin' phrowlin' about from wan house to another out here,
him such a nice ould gent?" demanded the Mayor. "Sure, look at him
now, as gintlemanly as a proize rooster with the hins!"</p>

<p>"Who do you think is the belle?" inquired Mrs Isaacs.</p>

<p>"Sure, there's none can hould a candle to Dot Saunders. Look at
that yaller hair of her with the pink rose in it, and she's tall,
and slim in the middle without too much squazin', an' haughty
enough to make people keep their distance without bein'
disagreeable."</p>

<p>"Well, now, I was just thinkin' she seems to have her nose a
little out of joint tonight. That dress she wore to the Government
House ball last Easter is a bit too fine with that great train like
a princess, and she's beginning to look old. She must be
twenty-seven last birthday." Mrs Isaacs did a computation founded
on her own grandchildren and confirmed this. "I was thinkin' Aileen
Healey is putting her in the shade. Aileen is a real little beauty,
and her dress, for all she made it herself, makes her look girlish
and sweet with the flowers round that deep V and the waist straight
round instead of peaked, and no train."</p>

<p>"Ah, but the Healeys haven't got the standing of the
Saunderses."</p>

<p>"But if a girl has the beauty and the men run after her, the
women of standing can't do much against her. Look at Aileen now,
doesn't she fit in with old Mr Blenkinsop and his swallowtail and
nice manners?"</p>

<p>It was true that few of the women could equal the girl and none
could excel her. There was a slimness, a dainty windblown quality
in her prettiness, that gave it the distinction of beauty, and she
had the further appeal of gentleness. She was of medium height and
her waist had the delicacy of Alexandra's or of the reigning
vice-reine's. She had naturally wavy chestnut hair, a little oval
face with soft Irish eyes of changing colour under emotion, and her
head was set upon her slim flat shoulders with the grace of a
flower on its stem. Also flowerlike was her taste in dress, and she
had the skill to execute it.</p>

<p>Mr Blenkinsop in requesting the pleasure assured her that she
made him feel young again, so like was she to the beautiful Miss
Severn of Budleigh Salterton whose beauty afterwards captured young
Lord Osgood, heir to the marquisate of Salterton. "Ah me, my dear,
I wish I were heir to a marquisate, and young again, and there is
no doubt that I should be similarly captured&mdash;all over again,"
he said, the kindly gallantry bringing a blush to Aileen's
cheek.</p>

<p>"Aileen Healey is a real beauty," observed Mrs Raymond Poole
(n&eacute;e Mazere), wife of Bert Poole's young half-brother, who
lived in Sydney. Rhoda was home for her mother's birthday and the
bridge ceremony.</p>

<p>"It's a cheap sort of prettiness, though," said Lucy
Saunders.</p>

<p>"No. I was going to say, that's just what it isn't. She reminds
me of Lady Carrington and other English ladies I meet at Government
House. It's a pity she's not of better stock. The way Ronnie Dice
looks at her it seems as if we might have her in the family. It's a
pity when a girl as lovely as that has no family ballast&mdash;it
leaves her a prey to all the men."</p>

<p>"More likely it leaves our families a prey to her until she
catches someone. I wish Ronnie would be successful. After all, he's
only a second cousin to you, and it would save me from something
nearer."</p>

<p>"Tell me, is it really true about Jack? I didn't give it any
credence. They've been marrying him and Bert Poole to every barmaid
and widow since the time of poor dear Emily and Mary."</p>

<p>"True! He seems to have gone suddenly off his head. Come till I
tell you. It looks like senility to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's not old enough for that!"</p>

<p>They moved off to confidences out of hearing.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>"Uncle Bert, do you know what I heard someone say?" inquired
Milly as Poole was swinging her by the hands in a set.</p>

<p>"Couldn't guess. You tell me."</p>

<p>"Well, it's rather private. I think we shall have to go outside
like the grown-ups." Poole suppressed too much of a chuckle and
smiled indulgently down upon her as he led her outside in quite the
style of amorous pairs.</p>

<p>"I heard Mrs Isaacs saying that Mother is trying to marry you.
It isn't true, is it?"</p>

<p>"You might hear a lot that isn't true if you listen to gossip.
It's best to let such things go in one ear and out the other."</p>

<p>"Of course I know that, Uncle Bert, about people that don't
matter, but you are different. You are not trying to put me off
now, are you, because you think I am a child? Mother is not going
to marry you, is she?"</p>

<p>"This is the first I have heard of it." As Milly still looked at
him questioningly he reassured her, "No, Milly, it is not
true."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that," said the little girl with a loud sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you'd object to me, do you?" Amusement
twinkled in his clear brown eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh no, of course I don't object to you, but I don't think
Mother could make you happy." Milly spoke with deep seriousness.
She had lately taken to reading romances of the <i>Ladies'
Journal</i> type.</p>

<p>"Dear me, how's that?"</p>

<p>"I don't think she has the right temperament to make you happy,"
reiterated Milly out of the store of her imbibings, and added
spontaneously, "I don't think she's nice enough."</p>

<p>"Dear me, what a pity for all our sakes."</p>

<p>"Now, Uncle Bert, you are laughing at me, and we had a
<i>compact</i>"&mdash;Milly loved the word&mdash;"that we were
never to laugh at each other when we were dead-serious."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll apologize and be double dead-serious. What are
we to do about it?"</p>

<p>"I had made up my mind to marry you myself when I'm old enough,
if you will wait."</p>

<p>"I've waited so long that a little more won't matter one way or
the other; but don't you think I'd be rather long in the
tooth?"</p>

<p>"Not if you stay just as you are till I am eighteen. I might
hurry it on to seventeen if you got impatient."</p>

<p>"The difficulty is that time won't wait for me, and nothing can
be done about it." Recollection played round the succession of
young things that had tried for his favour, and those other
instances in which he had wished to marry and fate or favour had
failed him. He remembered also the lamps of invitation lit for him
in the eyes of older women. Now here was his little playmate with
imitative prattle talking of marrying him. There had been many
such, now fecund matrons, delighted when their day had come to
receive his generous present and kindly raillery regarding
desertion of himself. Milly was a quaint old-fashioned little woman
in many ways, but her chatter vouched for her innocence, though it
would not be so long before some young chap claimed her too, and
only a thunderingly decent chap would be right for Milly.</p>

<p>"Well, Milly, this is great. Just what I have wanted. But I
think it had better be a secret engagement, then if you change your
mind it won't make such a fool of me."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, it must be a tight secret&mdash;a compact&mdash;between
you and me. If that Julie knew she would be jealous, and besides,
she's dead in love with Ronald."</p>

<p>"All right, that's settled. I should make a point never to take
any notice of what you hear anyone saying. It works out this way.
If someone says a foolish thing it is no harm unless it is
repeated. It is the repeating person who is dangerous."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see, Uncle Bert."</p>

<p>"Well, now, we had better go in, as another good thing is never
to make talk by staying out too long with any partner." Poole
laughed gleefully as Milly squeezed his hand and left him inside
the doorway.</p>

<p>Meanwhile other lips had said, "Oh, Ronnie, isn't this a divine
waltz? I wish I could go on waltzing with you for ever."</p>

<p>"Come out!" glowed Ronald as they approached one of the yawning
openings and he whirled the slender yielding form into the dark
velvet of the moonless summer night.</p>

<p>Wherever they turned, other couples similarly affected were
before them, or else they were in danger of the avid observation of
boundary-riders or horse-breakers or hotel slushier. They sped
through the long dry summer grasses, full of seeds and burrs, to
the far side of the grounds where the roses nodded their heads over
the paling fence of what had lately been old Mrs Dr James's domain.
Here was refuge for a while, but, disturbed by the murmur of
approaching voices, Ronnie tore down some of the palings with his
hands and lifted his partner through to seek the track where the
Yarrabongo fell round a bend in a song that charmed the night.</p>

<p>Their emotions were beyond words. They overflowed into the
fervent caresses of first love, an ecstasy approaching suffering.
When breathing necessitated a pause, Ronald could only gasp,
"Aileen! Aileen!" and crushing her to him began again, <i>da capo,
da capo</i>.</p>

<p>"We can't go back after this, darling. You must marry me, now,
soon!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I will, Ronnie. I will! Just as soon as you want me to. I'd
die at the thought of anyone else after this."</p>

<p>They sat upon a fallen tree. It was rough for the fragile ball
drapery, so he gathered her onto his knees. A mosquito stung him
and he pulled off his coat and wrapped it round his love.</p>

<p>"Good night, mate!" said some inquisitive strollers. Dice kept
still and they passed on with an insulting chuckle and an obscene
observation spoiling the beauty of emotion for the two in Eden.</p>

<p>"It's that horrid flash Billy Bowes, isn't it? Oh, Ronnie, do
you think they knew who we were?"</p>

<p>"It's none of their business if they did. Flash Billy is going
to find his market value going down with a bump, if I'm any
prophet."</p>

<p>"But, Ronnie, supposing Pa found out that we had come away out
here like this all alone, he'd kill me."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter what he'd do. You belong to me now. Oh,
darling, I love you so, I feel as if I would suffocate."</p>

<p>"I love you, too, but don't you think we'd better go hack
now?"</p>

<p>"I don't feel like going back to that heat and dust."</p>

<p>"But Ronnie darling, we can't stay out here. Think how it would
look. Pa would have a search party after me in no time. We've been
away much too long already.'</p>

<p>"It will be all right when we tell him we are engaged."</p>

<p>"Pa is so terribly strict with us. I'd rather go back to the
hall now."</p>

<p>"Let us run away and get married tomorrow."</p>

<p>"But where would we live? Pa wouldn't let us live at
Neangen."</p>

<p>Ronald was only manager for his mother at Bookaledgeree, things
were not prosperous and his whole family objected to the Healeys.
Ida had ridden up to Neangen with him and Aileen expressly at her
mother's command so that Ronald should not be compromised.</p>

<p>Two more strollers passed and asked for a match, trying to
discern the identity of the lovers. When they went on Aileen raised
herself from Ronald's embrace in panic. "That's Larry. I bet you Pa
is raging and Ma sent him to find me."</p>

<p>"I suggest I take you to Great-aunt Mazere. You can stay at
Three Rivers without any fear of scandal."</p>

<p>"We couldn't wake the old lady up at this hour, and your cousin
Charlotte is here with the girls."</p>

<p>Aily was hastening towards the hall and Ronald had to keep up
with her, the bliss of amorous catalepsy dispersed by the imminence
of parental opposition.</p>

<p>"Wait! Wait, darling! Don't run like that as if I had been
murdering you. Let us go together and brave it out. You are your
own mistress."</p>

<p>The girl steadied her fawnlike flight and fears. They regained
the neighbourhood of the hall. Ronald lit a buggy-lamp and enabled
Aileen to free herself of some of the grass-seeds. She slipped into
the toilet-room to rearrange her tresses while Ronald entered the
main opening and sought partners. Dot Saunders was just being led
out by Larry Healey, jun. She had waited in vain for Ronald and was
not enjoying the ball. Ronald looked round for a partner. Milly
piped in his ear, "Why don't you ask me?"</p>

<p>The youngster should have been in bed if rightly reared, but
Ronald blessed her intervention, looking over her head to see
Aileen enter. All evidence of her recent walk removed, she came in
with a Brennan girl and carefully steered away from her Parents.
This took her towards Mr Blenkinsop, who greeted her with a courtly
inclination. Aileen chatted with him about the heat and the pity of
the floor being so uneven and dusty, as thankful to him as Ronald
was to Milly. While this was happening SP-over-J requested the
pleasure, and Aileen tripped away on his arm so distrait that she
could distinguish no faces in the crush but Ronald and Milly's. The
others were unsettled like faces returning to one who has been
unconscious.</p>

<p>After one turn of the SP-over-J made some suggestion, which
Aileen accepted without knowing what he said, and was presently
conscious of being led in the direction from which she had just
returned with Ronald. SP-over-J did not tear down palings nor ramp
about gathering grass-seeds and risking snakebite. He helped Aileen
to the back seat of the Mazere sociable and climbed in after
her.</p>

<p>Larry, jun., a little later reported to his stepmother that he
had not been able to find Aily. "It's all right," said that lady.
"She's just gone outside with Mr Stanton."</p>

<p>"Aileen," said that gentleman, putting his arm about her,
"perhaps you can guess what I want to say. I know there is some
disparity in our ages, but your kind words to me from time to time
have led me to understand that that makes no difference to
you."</p>

<p>Without intentional defection on her part, the last person
talking to Aileen would always feel that his words carried greatest
weight, and he the happiest favour. It is a characteristic of the
world's charmers, male or female, but for success they must also be
endowed with the ability to prevent their compliance involving
them.</p>

<p>"Oh no," said Aileen helplessly. "Indeed you are not old at all,
Mr Stanton."</p>

<p>"You must learn to say <i>Jack</i>."</p>

<p>"Of course, Mr Stanton, if you wish it." Aileen's dazed mind was
subconsciously taking its hesitant course&mdash;anything for
peace.</p>

<p>"Well, Aileen, as I was saying," he drew the seductive form
closer, unaware of its spontaneous shrinking.</p>

<p>"Oh, if you please, Mr Stanton, it is such a hot night," she
murmured. Innate amiability made direct rebuff impossible and
disguised her objection to his embrace.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a hot night&mdash;bit muggy, like a thunderstorm. As
I was saying&mdash;in fact there is no need for me to say anything
more; you understand, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, please don't say anything. I understand, Mr
Stanton."</p>

<p>"<i>Mr Stanton</i>!"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, I mean <i>Jack</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I am a hit older, but that I hope will make me all
the more sensible. I'll understand better how to make you
comfortable than a flighty young fellow. I can give you anything
within reason..."</p>

<p>Here there was an interruption in the approach of two hereditary
occupants of the Mazere vehicle, in the persons of Marcia and Amy,
clan cousins in the throes of youthful infatuation. 'They heard the
assurance of Uncle Jack&mdash;he was uncle to one of
them&mdash;about making someone more comfortable than a young
fellow would be able to. This was hilarious to the two bright
misses. They should not have been "out" either only that it was
Great-grandma's big day, and discipline relaxed for the historic
occasion. The girls contumaciously went near to the carriage to
ascertain the second in this fascinating duet.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr Stanton, someone is coming," breathed the startled
Aileen as the adventuresses scampered away convulsed by the desired
information.</p>

<p>Dice was standing outside the entrance pondering which way to go
in search of Aileen when the tittering girls ran towards him. "Oh,
I say, Cousin Ronnie, such a lark! I'm sure you'll never guess."
Communication foundered in gales of adolescent giggles. "We went
over to the sociable for something and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what you found," interposed Milly. "You needn't make
such a fuss."</p>

<p>"Well, smarty, what did we find?"</p>

<p>"Uncle Jack and Aileen. Pooh, that's nothing! Everyone knows all
about that. Aileen was on a visit to Ten Creeks, and then I've been
up at Neangen with Uncle Bert and Uncle Jack." Her superior tone
put the other girls on their mettle.</p>

<p>"You don't know what he was saying," giggled Amy.</p>

<p>"Neither do you. You are only pretending to be smart."</p>

<p>"We're not." They giggled together consumedly. "I never beard
anything so funny in my life. I thought we should have died when he
said he was ever so much better than a young man, and Aileen said
of course he was."</p>

<p>"Oh he is, is he?" said Dice alarmingly. "Where is the sociable?
I must go and see or the old Death Adder might sting her."</p>

<p>"Over there behind the sheep-pens," said Amy, alarmed. Ronald
strode away like the strong man in melodrama.</p>

<p>"You're nice ones. I'd be ashamed to be you. What anyone says
does not matter at all; it's those who go round repeating things
who are a menace to society." Milly was pleased with the fine ring
of this. Her button of a nose in the air, she continued, "Uncle
Bert is the one to deal with this."</p>

<p>"We'd better make ourselves scarce," said Marcia to Amy, the
enjoyment of their "scoop" ruined.</p>

<p>"Do you think we had better poke our noses in other people's
affairs? It's not a nice thing to do, and generally not wise," said
Uncle Bert when the situation was revealed to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, but there was murder in Ronald's eye. You would be full of
regrets if anything happened," said Milly in her novelette
vocabulary. "Often we must sacrifice ourselves for duty."</p>

<p>Uncle Bert smiled under his moustache. "Suppose we whack the
difference? We can go in that direction and keep out of the way
unless we are desperately needed."</p>

<p>There was nothing more monumental in Ronald's eye than jealousy
and a determination to wreck his rival's plans. He was astounded by
Aileen's behaviour. What was she doing in the sociable with the old
Death Adder immediately after becoming engaged to himself? She
could surely see what had been coming. Tender thoughts intervened.
"Poor little Aileen, too gentle and innocent to be a match for old
Skinny Stanton!"</p>

<p>The girls had brought Aileen to her senses. "Oh please, Mr
Stanton, take me straight back to Ma. I couldn't think of..." She
balked, unable to utter, "Loving or marrying you." He might say he
had not mentioned marriage, and what a fool she would look!</p>

<p>They were out of the vehicle when Dice approached. "Aileen,
where are you? This is my dance," he said in an authoritative tone,
the conventions operating now that he and Stanton were face to
face.</p>

<p>"You will be glad to let Aileen off your dance when I tell
you..."</p>

<p>"Oh no, no!" said Aileen desperately. "There is a mistake. I
must keep my promise to dance."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said Stanton amicably. "I'll see you after."
The young people went off together but not to dance. Stanton
approached Milly and Poole.</p>

<p>"Devilish hot, isn't it?" remarked Poole. "Outside is much the
pleasantest place only for the skeets and grass-seeds." Stanton
walked towards the hall with Poole. Milly slipped her hand into
Uncle Bert's in acknowledgment of the momentous enterprise for the
public peace they were engaged upon.</p>

<p>Ronald found Aileen rather scatter-witted. "What were you doing
with that old Death Adder in the family coach? What was he trying
to stutter for himself?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Ronnie, I don't know. I was so upset. I wish we could go
away together and not see anyone." Aileen sounded tearful. She was
such an adorable little creature in that state that Ronald was
reduced to ditheration and strolled round the outside of the hall
holding her comfortingly and kissing her hands and thus affording
delectable evidence to the newsmongers.</p>

<p>Stanton shook off Poole and Milly, and went straight to old
Larry Healey and drew him aside. This was easy, for Larry had been
on the qui vive for a trump call all the evening.</p>

<p>"Ah, ah, ahem!" began the prospective bridegroom. "I wanted to
tell you, that is, I didn't want to leave it to Aileen to tell you,
but Aileen and I have come to an understanding by which I am a
happy man, and I hope Aileen will be happy too. This is no place to
say any more, but I'll take a turn up to Neangen tomorrow night or
the next day. You'll be home and recovered from the celebrations by
then."</p>

<p>"Sure, we will, and pleased to see you. I hope that you and my
little Aileen will be very happy. The child is young and there are
certain things to be talked over."</p>

<p>"That is so, but no more for the present."</p>

<p>"Who'd have thought this when we used to&mdash;"</p>

<p>SP-over-J did not want reminiscences involving their
approximation in age. "I'll bid you good night, Larry!" he said,
and escaped.</p>

<p>Larry immediately rounded up his flock. Not another dreary
moment would he hang round among the revellers. Norah and old Alf
Timson could look sheepish together at Neangen as they had been
doing for years without sitting up at a ball, and Joanna had been a
wallflower except for a dance with Poole and two with Dan Spires,
the Ten Creeks overseer, following his introduction to her by Aily.
All but Aileen were readily forthcoming.</p>

<p>"Och, I suppose she's with her ould man, and we'll have to give
them a few minutes," he observed.</p>

<p>"She's not with Mr Stanton," volunteered the lynx-eyed Julie.
"She's round the side there kissing and hugging with Ronald."</p>

<p>"Phwat!" ejaculated Larry ominously.</p>

<p>"I expect she's had to get rid of him. It is sometimes bard,"
said Mrs Healey, who had not taken Larry as her only
opportunity.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, you fool woman! Go you, Joanna and Norah, and
bring her at wanst."</p>

<p>Guided by Julie they found Aileen with Ronald and told her that
Pa was in a state to know where she was, for they were starting for
home at once.</p>

<p>"You're making yourself the talk of the town, absent from the
ballroom half the night, first with one and then another," said
Joanna.</p>

<p>Pa was not long in getting under way in the old buggy, with
Julie and Alf Timson as outriders, and Larry, jun., and Joanna
instead of Norah left to bring Aileen.</p>

<p>They could not tear her away in disregard of decorum now that
she was selected by the richest bachelor in the district to become
a member of the tribe of the Mazeres and Stantons, the real
geebungs of the community. When she had incoherently prevailed upon
Dice to leave her, SP-over-J insisted upon conducting her to the
door of the dressing-room.</p>

<p>"Whatever do you mean, have you lost your wits?" demanded Joanna
in a heated whisper when she had her half-sister safely in the
dressing-room. "You know what Pa is, and to engage yourself to Mr
Stanton, and then to be carrying on like a streel with Ronald Dice
under the eyes of everyone, why, it's just common indecent!"</p>

<p>"I'm not engaged to Mr Stanton," protested Aileen, and began to
cry.</p>

<p>"You can always pipe your eye at every convenient and
inconvenient time. Pull yourself together and have a little sense,
for the love of God."</p>

<p>An unobserved onlooker was Milly, determined to intervene should
it become necessary. She espied Ronald hanging about the
dressing-room opening.</p>

<p>"Is Aileen in there?" he demanded in what the student of
low-class novelettes of high life considered an appropriately
agitated manner.</p>

<p>"Yes, she's dressing to go home."</p>

<p>"Tell her to step to the door to speak to me for a minute."
Milly bounded off full of ambassadorial zeal.</p>

<p>"Oh, tell him, please, I can't see him," wailed Aileen.</p>

<p>"I should think not! Tell him she's dressing," added Joanna.
Milly returned to Ronald.</p>

<p>"Is there anyone in there but Joanna and Aily?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Ronald strode in. Milly followed wonderingly through such an
unprecedented rent in convention.</p>

<p>"Aileen," he demanded, "what the blazes is this about old Jack
Stanton giving out that you are engaged to him?"</p>

<p>"It's true, Mr Dice, and can't you see that you are upsetting my
sister? Whatever your private feelings are, I think you should
control yourself and not make a public scandal, violating modesty,"
said Joanna, not without dignity.</p>

<p>"Scandal be damned! That's on the other foot. Let Aileen speak
for herself. Aileen, are you engaged to that old Death Adder?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Ronnie, no, of course not. There is some terrible
misunderstanding."</p>

<p>"I thought so, my darling," said he, clasping the girl to him.
The excitement and heat of the day had been excessive. Milly's
heroine did the right thing. Her eyes closed, her lovely form went
limp in her ardent lover's arms. She had been endowed with a weapon
potent in the hands of weak femininity.</p>

<p>"She's fainted!" gasped Joanna.</p>

<p>They laid her on a buggy rug. Milly sped to Uncle Bert. She
considered the crisis sufficiently mature.</p>

<p>"Uncle Bert"&mdash;she placed a heatedly whispering young mouth
on his ear&mdash;"Ronald rushed into the dressing-room and asked
Aileen if she was engaged to the old Death Adder&mdash;that means
Uncle Jack&mdash;and Aileen fell down in a deathly swoon."</p>

<p>Uncle Bert enjoined silence, his arm round his young
confederate. He sought his sister Charlotte, Mrs Philip Mazere. A
tall, gaunt woman, sparing of speech, her black hair slightly
streaked with grey, she was wonderfully like her brother. Her
weather-beaten face and work-marred hands betokened a hard life as
the wife of the oldest son of Three Rivers, but she was a rock of
refuge to all who called upon her. Capable, quiet, she acted where
action was needed, observed the golden rule of silence as well as
of sisterhood, and was not inquisitive as to motives and causes.
Without disturbance she went to the dressing-room. She had seen
many accidents, much sickness, and some tragedy in her sixty
years.</p>

<p>"She has only fainted," she remarked to Joanna. "You have bathed
her face with cold water and loosened her stays, that's all that
can be done. Bert, you and Ronald see that no one comes in to take
up the air."</p>

<p>Opportunely, Mayor M'Haffety, a little elevated, at that moment
burst into an unscheduled gem of oratory and held the people in the
hall. It was not so fortunate that Mrs Isaacs, to whom by some
faculty all was speedily known, should come to the
dressing-room.</p>

<p>"Whatever has happened," she exclaimed. "Can I be be of any
help?"</p>

<p>"Ronald," said Mrs Philip, "put the horses in the sociable and
we'll run Aileen up to Three Rivers and put her to bed, and she'll
be all right in the morning."</p>

<p>"That's very kind of you, Mrs Mazere. But we must go on home. Pa
will be in a terrible state. He and Ma won't know what has
happened."</p>

<p>"You and Larry go on as intended, Aileen can't take that ride
now," said Poole.</p>

<p>"I expect it was too far in the heat, and then the dancing on
top of it," said Mrs Philip, as calm, as comforting, as pump
water.</p>

<p>"Our old phaeton will be better than the sociable, and the horse
is in it," said Mrs Isaacs, kind of heart and bursting to be in
this promising affair.</p>

<p>"That will be just the thing," agreed Mrs Philip, her mind on
the rearrangement of bedding accommodation so that Aileen could
have a room to herself. Three Rivers was chock-a-block. Family
ramifications were considerable, and it was the custom of everyone
coining to town to billet at the old place. Already beds were in
the billiard-room and the office. Mrs Philip decided that her
grandson's single bed in a box veranda room at the New House, which
had been set aside for a young Philip and Matt Dice, would do
nicely, and the two dispossessed could take a pillow and rug to the
hay-loft.</p>

<p>Mrs Isaacs, returning from showing where her phaeton and old
yellow mare were moored, met SP-over-J, and, impelled by her nose
for news, told him that Aileen had fainted and that she had
arranged for her phaeton to take the girl to Three Rivers. Stanton
hastened to the scene and announced that he would take Aileen to
Stanton's Plains, and talked of finding Lucy.</p>

<p>"It is more convenient to take her home with me," said Mrs
Philip. "She can rest quietly till tomorrow."</p>

<p>"You can be quite at ease," said Poole to Joanna. "She'll be as
right as rain with Charlotte. I'll take her home myself tomorrow on
the way to Curradoobidgee."</p>

<p>"That is putting everyone to altogether too much trouble," said
Joanna, out of whose hands the whole matter was slipping, and who
was worried as to her father's idea of what she should do in the
circumstances. "I think I had better stay with Aily."</p>

<p>"By all means. We'll find a nook for you," said Mrs Philip.</p>

<p>"You can go home with my sister and we can come in for Aileen in
the morning," said SP-over-J.</p>

<p>Joanna thought of Lucy, unable to recognize her that day, and
Mrs Ned Stanton, presiding genius at Stanton's Plains, who had been
even more gelid, and she faltered. "I think I had better go with
Larry, and we can bring the buggy back for Aily tomorrow."</p>

<p>Matters were furthered by Larry from outside asking Milly to
find out if the girls were ready and adjuring them to hurry. Milly,
hedging against scandal-mongering, gave Larry the bones of the
incident. Joanna came out to consult with him.</p>

<p>"The devil!" observed Larry. "At all events you stay by her and
see what goes on. It would be just the thing to stay at Three
Rivers, as good as going to stay with Queen Victoria herself only
for Ron Dice being there. At any rate, I'm the right one to drive
the vehicle there and then I'll go on and tell Pa what has happened
or he'll be roaring down like a town hull and making a fool of
us."</p>

<p>Larry went in with the announcement, but Charlotte Mazere
without malice or forethought or hindthought blew him out. "I'd
rather have Bert, if you don't mind. He knows the way to the New
House in the dark along those lanes, and we don't want a fuss and
the whole celebration about our ears."</p>

<p>"The best is for me to drive Joanna and Aileen out to Stanton's
Plains at once without any fuss, and Charlotte, you can tell Mrs
Ned and Lucy presently so as not to disturb them," said SP-over-J,
as his contribution, but Charlotte was confirmed in her plan by
Aileen's clasping her arm and whispering, "Dear Mrs Philip, please
put me to bed at your house. I have a terrible pain in my head and
Stanton's Plains is so far."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Joanna, you can come home with us," said SPover-J,
desirous of keeping something in his own hands, but this decided
Joanna to go with Larry.</p>

<p>"You'll promise me, Mr Poole, that you'll bring Aily yourself,"
she said to him. He gave his word and she went away content as
people did when Poole promised. This put the affair into neutral
hands and eliminated Ron Dice. Joanna and Larry waited to see that
he was excluded from the phaeton. Poole performed this office:
"Ron, old man, will you quietly tell the others why Charlotte has
gone home and I'll bring Mrs Isaacs's trap back without delay."
Then he saw the face of his little colleague. "Milly, don't you
think you ought to come home with me and Aunt Charlotte? You should
have been curled up in your possum-rug hours ago."</p>

<p>Milly was suffering indecision. "I'd love to go with you, Uncle
Bert, but don't you think it would be well for me to keep my eve on
things here till you come back? I don't like Uncle Jack as much as
I like you, but still he's not a death adder, is he?"</p>

<p>"Not by any means," replied Poole, again smiling under his
moustache. "And that's another thing, these little hard names don't
mean much if they are let pass without notice. Well, you keep your
eye on things here till I return, and remember that a shut mouth is
good for keeping the flies out and the brains in, as our friend
Mick Muldoon would say."</p>

<p>"Well, now," said Milly as the vehicle lights made a galanty
show of objects in its way, and tucking her arm in Ronald's in
grandmotherly style, "you and I must manage this so as not to make
a public scandal."</p>

<p>"Aw, hell, I'll punch his blooming old head! I'll break his
scraggy old neck!" said Ronald, pulling himself from her grasp,
"and you can tell him so if you want something to do, and then
jolly well go and mind your own blooming business!"</p>

<p>Milly was temporarily confounded by the suspicion that Ronnie
was not so nice as she had thought. She had been investing him with
the cloak of the lovely young heirs of the nobility who finally
carried off the beautiful Lady Adelines from&mdash;from the
old&mdash;old&mdash;<i>death adders</i>! This did not seem a bit
dashing and romantic like the stories. Perhaps Aileen had not
sufficient backbone to be a Lady Adeline, but then again all that
the Lady Adelines had to do was to be pretty and weak and faint,
and this Aileen was doing very well indeed. The discrepancies
intruded doubtlessly because the Lady Adelines and Lord Percys
lived in England among castles and ivy with butlers and
ladies'-maids, whereas round Bool Bool were only boundary-riders
and shearers and common servant-girls, crudely unromantic, and who
would have grinned had the missus been incapable of dressing her
own hair. Milly decided to seek information from Mr Blenkinsop at
the first opportunity. He knew real live lords and ladies, and
maintained that Aileen was like the Marchioness of Salterton. Milly
was highly looking forward to having Mr Blenkinsop under her own
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>She was a little dashed for the moment but still game, and
decided to ascertain how Uncle Jack was faring. She found him near
the sheep-pens whither Ronald too was walking. They met and Ronald
took issue at once. "See here, Stanton, I'll thank you to keep away
from Miss Healey in future&mdash;the farther away the better.
You've nearly thrown her into a fever already, and I don't wonder,
an old hide like you after a young girl is enough to turn the milk
sour."</p>

<p>"You're mad!" said Stanton. "In future I'll take a gun to you or
send for the police if I see you within a mile of my future
wife."</p>

<p>"I'd knock your old mug into the middle of next week only it
would be manslaughter to lay a finger on such an old crock."</p>

<p>"Now, now!" said Milly in her best manner, stepping courageously
between them. "This is not the way for honourable gentlemen to
bring a lady's name into discredit. A real gentleman would die of a
pent-up heart rather than do such a thing."</p>

<p>"Rats! Go and bag your head!" said Ronald, but amused in spite
of himself.</p>

<p>"You want a good sound clip under the ear and feeding on bread
and water for a week. Your mother will suffer for the way she lets
you run wild, one of these days," snapped Uncle Jack, putting a
rough hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Here, don't hurt the child!" said Ronald.</p>

<p>"You're both as silly as a pair of mad old turkey-cocks when
they put their wings down and gobble," said Milly, her mettle
roused. "What are you roaring at each other like a pair of demented
bulls for, and both saying you are engaged to Aileen! Why don't you
wait till the morning and ask her? She'll he sure to know, unless
she's a Mormon."</p>

<p>"Hip-hooray for you, kiddy! It's a pity the senile members of
your family haven't a little of your common sense."</p>

<p>"You get your mother to take you home this instant," snarled
Uncle Jack. "I'll take you in hand tomorrow."</p>

<p>"A lady would have a nice time with him, wouldn't she, Milly?"
said Ronald, turning away as he saw the inquisitive Mrs Isaacs
waddling his way. Milly also thought it good to go while the going
was good, and hid herself from her mother to await Uncle Bert.</p>

<p>Larry and Joanna rode away over the new bridge prognosticating
what might happen and filled with excitement about what had already
occurred. "Pa will belt the stuffing out of Aileen to get herself
into such a mix-up," said Larry.</p>

<p>"She's such a weak-minded fool that she deserves it," agreed
Joanna.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>When Flash Billy Bowes had prowled past where Aileen and Ronald
were seated, he separated from his companions and went towards
town. Ronald and Aileen canoodling on a log against the wishes of
old Larry or his old Skinny Guts boss was a juicy morsel, but it
could be left to Tommy Roper for the present. Something more vital
tormented Billy since Milly had put the Young Whisker filly through
her tricks before the crowd. Added to this was Poole's exhibition
with the Corroboree colt. The renowned outlaw, who got rid of all
the cracks in fair fight, tamed in the season, fit for
Great-grandma Mazere to ride, and not by the invincible Flash Billy
himself, but by old Bert Poole, whom he had decried as going barmy
with age! There was that flaming colt as steady as old Flea Creek!
Just to show off, that blooming old crawler of a Poole had put the
reins over the animal's neck and he followed him about everywhere
like a dog till the &mdash;&mdash; old woman wanted to get on him.
No, Flash Billy was not happy.</p>

<p>He took the horse he was pacing&mdash;the Wamgambril
colt&mdash;and led him along the fence of the showgrounds and down
under the Stanton Street bridge by the river track till he was
opposite Three Rivers homestead. He had seen Milly riding there
from the new bridge with her precious Uncle Bert. Everyone making
such a fuss about the brat! Billy thought her too flash for
anything and badly in need of being taken down a peg or two. Where
would the filly be, and who would be in charge? They never left the
old woman alone now. Gripes! she was an age, an' drivin' about in
four-in-hands with old Prendergast like a two-year-old. These old
birds were a &mdash;&mdash; nuisance. They ought to know when it
was time to bag their blooming old heads.</p>

<p>Flash Billy ran through the stables first: there was no sign of
the filly there, only Corroboree in a locked stall, and Queen Anne,
Poole's big bay mare, the stallion's pregnant lady-in-waiting, in
the next stall to ensure his placidity. The filly would be in the
orchard. Billy picked his way among the heavily fruited trees and
heard her whinny from the river-side. He caught her without
difficulty. Ah, the little beauty! Sheer covetous delight in her
perfection thrilled him. She would be a fortune to any man. He lit
a match, and saw tracks where she had been attempting to clear the
high palings. By gum, she had the old mare in her as well as the
Whisker strain! She could be learnt to do anything but talk. He
wrenched away a couple of palings, led her through, replaced the
boards, and went to where his horse was tethered under the trees.
He saddled Romp and made her sham dead. Gripes, she did it for him
just as obediently as for young Milly; then he mounted and made
sure that she remembered other lessons.</p>

<p>"You little queen! You blooming little pearl!" he breathed in
adoration. "Remember everythink I ever learnt you!"</p>

<p>There he had her in his hand, and wanted her more than he wanted
anything, even the yellow-haired barmaid in Queanbeyan, and he did
not know what to do about it. He thought of letting her go free to
be lost, but she was too precious. She would make back to Ten
Creeks Bun for a certainty, but someone might nab her on the way.
Lordy, what he would not give to be safe in Victoria or Queensland
with that little beauty to do what he liked with! She would be a
comfortable living for any man. And that &mdash;&mdash; old Skinny
Guts not only had a horse like this but the Corroboree and the
Wamgambril and a dozen others. It was not fair, while other fellers
just as good, and even better, had not a moke of their own. While
he stood there riven by infatuation and covetousness a light turned
out of the public lane into the private one beside the orchard.</p>

<p>Curse it! Someone was coming home early. If he dropped the filly
she would follow him and he would be found out. The phaeton lights
were nearing him in the narrow lane. He took the expedient
occurring to his wits, slipped the saddle off and came boldly
forward with the filly, leading her by a bridle-rein only. He saw
Poole in the light of the lamp as he opened the gate.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Mr Poole?"</p>

<p>"Yes, who's there?"</p>

<p>"Me&mdash;Billy Bowes. I found this here little lady down by the
bridge. She must have got outer somewhere. Where will I put
her?"</p>

<p>"She was in the orchard, but there is no use in putting her
there again if she got out."</p>

<p>"Golly, if she got out of the orchard she is a
caution&mdash;worse than the ole mare!"</p>

<p>"Take her round to the stable."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr Poole. Can I let the horse out for you?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Billy. I'm going back to the Hall. Thank you for
bringing the filly back. Miss Milly would have been upset to lose
her."</p>

<p>"Yes, it'd be terrible to think how Miss Milly would take on if
anything happened this here filly."</p>

<p>Poole left his charge at the New House of the old homestead, and
as Aileen protested that she was all right, he went straight back
with Mrs Isaacs's chariot. He offered Billy a lift.</p>

<p>"No, thanks, Mr Poole. I left me horse down here."</p>

<p>Billy went away towards the river. Why hadn't he brought the
filly back to the main entrance, pondered Poole, as the ancient
mare jogged along at her unmendable pace. Bowes could not have
found the filly unless she was out on the highway. What could he be
doing in the river paddocks? However, his thoughts reverted to
Aileen. What on earth did old Jack mean, jumping into the young
people's hash and acting like&mdash;like a death adder. He smiled
as he thought of Milly. The little girl was waiting for him when he
returned the phaeton to its position. He was amused by her
grandmotherly air.</p>

<p>"Well, Milly, old pal, everything all right, I hope."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Uncle Bert. Ronald and Uncle Jack nearly made a scene.
They had a lot of that&mdash;I don't know how to pronounce it, but
it is spelled c-h-o-l-e-r, and they were very rude to me, but I
think I prevented a f-r-a-c-a-s&mdash;that's what it is, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"So they were rude to you, were they?" He smiled when she
detailed what had taken place.</p>

<p>"Excessively. But I don't mind because of the c-h-o-l-e-r."</p>

<p>"Well, you know, Milly, it's a good thing to keep out of the
other fellow's rows, and to have as few of your own as possible.
You'll never get any thanks for jumping in, and you might come a
cropper, but that was certainly good sense about settling the
matter by asking Aileen."</p>

<p>"Yes, you'd hardly believe that grown men could have been so
silly as not to think of that, would you?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there are more silly people than the other sort
knocking about for us to knock up against, and that being so I want
to make a bargain with you."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Uncle Bert. Is it something nice and exciting, can we
have it for a <i>compact</i>?"</p>

<p>"I should think we could. It is only this: supposing you should
ever be in a mess of any sort, a difficulty, it doesn't matter
what, and it doesn't matter if it is your own fault, you'll come
and tell me all about it, won't you? And no matter how bad it may
be, I'll pull you out, if I can, without any croaking. Now do you
promise?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Uncle Bert. It sounds more solemn than exciting: that
will be a real <i>compact</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes, a <i>compact</i>."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>Exhausted by bodily and emotional activity and aided by a glass
of wine, Aileen slept heavily. She awoke a little bewildered to
find herself in a tiny white room with a boy's guns and bats on the
wall and a pain in her head. Recollection revealed her plight
between Dice and Stanton. There was bliss in recalling the passages
with Ronald on the log beside the river with its song so sweet and
cool&mdash;and wild first kisses. She, thrilled again and again in
remembrance. Then intervened thoughts of that horrid old Stanton,
and Joanna and Larry reprimanding her, and Ronald glaring, and now
Pa to be faced. If only she could stay in the little room and be
ill with brain fever for months and months so that her father would
withdraw his objection to Ronald to save her life; or if Ronald
would only come and take her away somewhere so that no one would
see them again till they had been comfortably married for ages, and
had a beautiful home!</p>

<p>"I see you are awake," said old Mrs Philip, entering the room.
"You were nice and quiet here. How do you feel?"</p>

<p>"It's my head. It has such a terrible pain in it that I can't
lift it from the pillow."</p>

<p>"Lie still, then. I expect you were too much in the sun in your
hot riding-habit. It was a very warm day yesterday. I'll send you a
nice strong cup of tea."</p>

<p>The tea came with Marcia, Charlotte's granddaughter, a girl
about Milly's age.</p>

<p>"I say, Aileen," she began, eager to get ahead of that Milly,
who assumed the airs of a grown-up. "Wasn't it exciting last night?
It must be wonderful to have men loving you as much as that! They
looked murder at each other. Ron Dice stayed here last night and
has asked Grandma when he can see you. Uncle Jack Stanton came
immediately after breakfast and asked how you were, and said he
wanted to see you too. What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I should love to see Ronnie."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you like him best. If Ronnie proposed to me I could
very nearly marry him myself, and he's only a sort of second
cousin. Why don't you get dressed and I'll tell Ron to sneak round
and see you."</p>

<p>Marcia's mother was a niece of SP-over-J, the daughter of his
brother. Marcia's father was Philip Mazere, the third of his name,
and Bert Poole's nephew. He was now known as young Philip.
Charlotte (Poole) and her husband had become old Mr and Mrs Philip,
and the original old Mrs Philip was now Great-grandma to all
whether they had the blood-right to the title or not. Old Mr and
Mrs Philip lived in the Big House of the conglomerate homestead.
Great-grandma had retired to the Old House, the erection that had
superseded the pioneer humpy to which she had come from Parramatta
in the thirties. Aileen was in a room in the new house built for
young Philip when he married. Young Philip had grown up with
Great-grandpa Mazere and had managed the place for him when all his
sons left him.</p>

<p>Aileen straightway dressed. The thought of seeing Ronnie
banished the pain in her head. Marcia, enchanted to be in such an
affair, assisted her, talking volubly.</p>

<p>"Everybody said you were the belle last night. Cousin Dot was
quite in the shade. They were tired of her dress because they had
seen it before. She danced with your brother Larry, and only danced
with Ronnie after you disappeared so mysteriously. Everyone was
talking about that. They thought all sorts of things when they
found that the belle of the ball had disappeared."</p>

<p>When Aileen was ready Marcia told Ronald. Charlotte returned to
the Big House. She had been her brother's messenger and he agreed
that the best thing for Aileen was to lie still for an hour or two
longer.</p>

<p>"Aileen has a splitting headache, Uncle Jack," his niece Maud
(young Mrs Mazere, wife of Philip the third ) was reporting to him.
"Mamma came over and saw her this morning and said she was to have
a cup of tea and keep quiet. Mamma thinks she may have been a
little too much in the sun yesterday."</p>

<p>"I wanted to drive her home today, but the best place is here
with you. You'll take care that she is kept quiet and sees no
one."</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Jack...There is a good deal of talk. Of course I
have said nothing, but are you thinking of giving me an aunt?"</p>

<p>SP-over-J, always gauche, looked foolish, nursed his knee, and
replied, "Yes, it's true. I think it's about time I settled down,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;er, of course, we've often wondered why you didn't,
long ago. Only Aileen is rather young, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. It's not as if she were a girl in her teens.
I was never more grown up than when I was her age."</p>

<p>"What will Aunt Lucy do?"</p>

<p>"Lucy might marry and leave me alone; besides, she could still
look after Ten Creeks when I'm not there, or Turrill Turrill the
same way. She likes tigrinizing hack and forth."</p>

<p>While this talk extended in the front room Aileen repledged
herself among the raspberry canes and lilac-bushes at the foot of
the garden whither the lovers had fled, and Marcia and Amy tittered
together in a handy retreat.</p>

<p>"Aileen!"</p>

<p>"Ronnie!"</p>

<p>He clasped her to him, renewing the rapture of last night. She
was as beautiful in her trim habit as she had been in the frilly
ball gown.</p>

<p>"How did the old Death Adder get the notion that you are engaged
to him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He must have misunderstood in some way. I was
anxious to get rid of him, because the girls were coming, and he
took too much for granted."</p>

<p>"Just like him! You must give him the straight tip the first
moment he says anything to you. You will, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes."</p>

<p>"I'll announce our engagement at once and that will chuck him
out of the field."</p>

<p>"Yes, hut, Ronnie, how soon can we be married?"</p>

<p>"Just as soon as I can fix up with Mamma."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ronnie, must you wait for that?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I must, but Mamma will soon come round."</p>

<p>"Then I think we had better say nothing about the...about us
being engaged for the present."</p>

<p>"But if we don't you'll have the old Death Adder dancing
round."</p>

<p>"Unless you can marry me and take me away at once. Oh, Ronnie,
I'm frightened." Aileen melted into tears.</p>

<p>"Whatever is there to be frightened of, darling?" He was all
tenderness. She was irresistible in tears.</p>

<p>"I'm not frightened if I could only stay near you all the time,
but I've got to face Pa."</p>

<p>"He can't eat you, and you are over twenty-one."</p>

<p>"That doesn't make any difference. You don't know Pa."</p>

<p>"I'll go up and tell him my plans&mdash;face the lion in his
den. Do you feel like riding straight off with me now?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't run away from Mrs Mazere like that and get into
everybody's black books. Besides, Mr Poole promised Joanna to drive
me home himself today. She wouldn't have left me else."</p>

<p>"We don't need to drag good old Bert into it now that you are
able to ride. We could make Bookaledgeree for dinner and tell Mamma
and the girls and get them on our side from the jump."</p>

<p>"I'm sure Mrs Lucy Saunders and Mrs Ned Stanton don't want me
either," said Aileen miserably.</p>

<p>"Don't they! That's fine, then, because they won't be any help
to the old Death Adder."</p>

<p>At this moment Marcia kited down the orchard and warned that
Mother was coming to see if Aileen was well enough to talk to Uncle
Jack. "Run away and hide, Ronald," exhorted Marcia.</p>

<p>"What for? It's your old Uncle Jack who ought to hide his head
in shame. I wish I could make myself larger and more prominent,"
said Ronald, standing forth defiantly where the summer sun shone
dazzlingly on the slope and melted away in cool inviting shade
among the willows by the singing river where the lazy cattle dozed
and the dark-green tobacco grew luxuriantly.</p>

<p>Dice refused to be banished. He escorted Aileen to the
veranda.</p>

<p>Young Mrs Philip had been reared in the notion that Uncle Jack
was not to be trifled with, and the attitude in which nieces are
generally disposed towards rich bachelor uncles. To help him to
marriage would end the hope of inheriting his property, but to
oppose him would not advance her status as a prospective heiress
either. The feeling held that Uncle Jack had better not be
crossed.</p>

<p>"Dear me, Miss Healey, I thought your head was too bad to lift
from the pillow." Mrs Mazere's tone was not sympathetic.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd see how it was, and now I'll have to go and lie
down again. It's terrible." The girl was postponing a direct and
conclusive issue by edging towards the bedroom.</p>

<p>"Uncle Jack is riding up towards Neangen today and he thought to
take you with him."</p>

<p>"Mr Poole promised to drive me up. I hardly feel able to
ride."</p>

<p>"I hadn't heard of that arrangement," said Mrs Philip a little
stiffly. Aileen seemed a shilly-shallier, and the Mazere clan did
not revere that of Healey for the old action about Eureurunda. It
was a pity Uncle Jack hadn't sense to pick someone more suitable.
However, she'd rather Ronald married Aileen than have her for an
aunt. Actuated by this bias she said, "You lie down sensibly and
don't be eating hot raspberries on an empty stomach. I'll tell
Uncle Jack that probably you won't be going home till
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, please, Mrs Mazere, that is very kind of you," said
Aileen, straw-clutching. She went to her room. Young Mrs Philip
returned to her uncle. Dice disported himself where Stanton could
not leave the premises without seeing him.</p>

<p>"Miss Healey really has a terrible head," reported Mrs Philip.
"It's nothing serious, I hope. Does she want a doctor?"</p>

<p>"No. She's a bilious subject, I should think, by the look of
her. With a bilious person any little excitement always results in
one of these attacks. She needs to lie still and cat nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh well, then, I'll push along, because I have a busy day. You
can...you can give Aileen my love."</p>

<p>"Very well, Uncle. I suppose I ought to kiss you and
congratulate you. You mustn't forget your old niece wants to be
loved too, even when you have a new wife," she said, embracing
him.</p>

<p>"Oh no, no, of course not," he said awkwardly, but she could see
that he was pleased.</p>

<p>As he emerged upon the veranda there was Ronald Dice fooling
with Marcia and Amy. Uncle Jack turned back into the passage.
"What's he doing here?"</p>

<p>"Every bed in the Big House was full, so they asked us to put
him up."</p>

<p>"He could easily have ridden home. I don't think you'll find him
a fit companion for the girls."</p>

<p>"He doesn't come here much," she said comfortingly "The less the
better. Don't let him worry Aileen."</p>

<p>The sight of Dice put harsher determination into the day's
action for Stanton. He was closeted with the bank manager for a
long session in conjunction with Arthur Rankin, the lawyer. Then he
had dinner at M'Haffety's Hotel, a rare condescension. Skinny Guts
was rarely known to shell out his money for tucker when there were
clan members at hand to cosher himself upon.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>He progressed comfortably towards Neangen on his fine blood
horse, paced by Flash Billy, taking note of the land as he went.
Soon he was riding the boundary of Bookaledgeree, a fine property
when Tim Brennan had sold it to the Dices, but mismanaged ever
since. There had been foot-rot in the flocks&mdash;it was to be
seen from the main road&mdash;and would be again as soon as the
drought broke. The old cockatoo fences, perfunctorily topped,
wouldn't stop a milking cow, and there were fields of briars
dragging the fleeces off the flocks. There must have been
hundredweights of wool tufted about the paddocks.</p>

<p>Stanton's mind went back about thirty-five years to when they
used to admire the sweet briar-bush in old Mrs Mazere's garden,
which old Mazere prized so much because it was English, and which
had been a rare plant to the native-born...By Jove! old Mrs Mazere
had little dreamt then what a bad thing she was doing for the
country.</p>

<p>Beyond the homestead the Yarrabongo showed in cool beauty
between its drapery of shrubs, and ahead was the Bookaledgeree
Creek, another fine stream. It was one of the best-watered places
in the colony and had a good deal of open grazing land. It needed
pulling together, though, and instead of doing that Ronald Dice was
always dressed up in knee-breeches and long spurs riding about on a
flash horse and fooling with the girls. Well, there was one girl he
wouldn't be able to fool with much longer. Stanton had satisfaction
in the scope and power of his mortgages.</p>

<p>The reports from all over the country were of an old-man
drought. The weather could break even now, though Stanton had never
known a spring drought to break before autumn. This meteorological
experience was corroborated by every old hand he knew, both those
of the Plains and the green grass country. Turrill Turrill was
suffering, but he could shift surplus stock to the mountains. Bool
Bool and all that country from Ten Creeks to the Upper Murrumbidgee
and right back to Coolooluk and Mungee via Monaro was a world of
its own, the value of which could not yet be computed. Future
generations would awake to it. A native of the green grass country,
the love of these wonderful ranges, streams, and valleys held first
place in Stanton's affections.</p>

<p>He reached Neangen as Larry, jun., was penning the calves for
the night. Old Larry gave warning to the women and went to receive
him.</p>

<p>"We've been expecting Aileen and Bert Poole all the afternoon.
Aileen is all right, I hope."</p>

<p>"All but a bilious headache. Young Mrs Philip is in charge of
her and they talk of driving up tomorrow. Aileen is all right
there."</p>

<p>"She couldn't be righter anywhere except with her own mother,"
responded Larry, satisfied for Aileen to be in the famous Mazere
headquarters under the direct guardianship of Stanton's niece.
"Come in! Come in! Leave your horse. Larry will put him away for
the night."</p>

<p>"I was thinking of riding back in the cool."</p>

<p>"What's your hurry? 'Twill be cool enough in the morning."</p>

<p>"I'm rather pushed for time. This drought&mdash;though we don't
feel it much here&mdash;terrible in Riverina. I want to get away
without delay and see the state of the stock and grass, but I
wanted to leave this matter about Aileen fixed up."</p>

<p>"Sure, we can talk that over this evening when the family has
gone to bed. There's no hurry, and you or the girl might want to
change your mind. There's others in the field." Old Larry laughed
and showed his long tobacco-stained fangs. He had had time to
collect himself and to decide upon the most profitable hand to
play. Old Jack was biting hard and greedily.</p>

<p>The prospective bridegroom went inside to be greeted by the
women, to have a wash in the spare-room, and to sit on the veranda
in the cool among the roses till summoned to the evening meal.
Afterwards the family engaged in singing round the piano.</p>

<p>"Sure, it's a pity Aileen isn't home. She's our musician," said
old Larry. "She can play anything at all and she sings like a
canary."</p>

<p>SP-over-J decided to get a new piano for Turril! Turrill and to
send the old one up to Ten Creeks Run.</p>

<p>While the evening was still young Mrs Healey ordered the
children to bed, and said she would go herself because she had not
yet recovered from the bridge celebrations. Joanna and Norah
murmured something about a batch of bread. Larry, jun., went to
look at the horses and did not come back.</p>

<p>SP-over-J was not a word-waster and never bilked a vital issue.
"Well, since I'm in a hurry to get away and likely shan't he back
till after Christmas, I thought I'd just ride up to confirm what I
put forward about Aileen last night."</p>

<p>"That's all right, Jack. There's no hurry."</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact there is, rather. I want to get hack to
Riverina early this autumn. I'll just come lip for the wedding, and
I'm ready for that in January, as soon as Aileen can get
ready."</p>

<p>"Oh my, oh me! a man in love! What a hurry we're in! You must
remember I haven't had time to hear what my little Aily thinks
yet."</p>

<p>"She has accepted, and you are agreeable. We don't have to
consider anyone else as I can see."</p>

<p>"That is very fine as far as it goes, but a young girl in love
doesn't look much ahead, and though I've had rather hard hick of
late years, and Neangen is not to be compared with Eueurunda, where
Aily was born, nor yet with Little River, where my father started,
but still an' all we're a very affectionate family and our little
Aily is welcome to stay with us for ever unless we could be sure
that she was bettering herself."</p>

<p>"I'm well able to provide for a wife and family and to give
Aileen as much as she's had with you, and a great deal more.</p>

<p>"Oh, sure. I know that, Jack. Your whole family were always
thrifty, enterprising fellows, but it's this way: when I married
Aily's mother, the old woman, my mother-in-law, would not let me
have her till I settled a nice little nest-egg upon her, and she
always said it was such a blessing that she will expect the same
for her daughters."</p>

<p>SP-over-J marvelled that this piece of business had never leaked
out, though what every other husband in the district got with or
gave his bride was popular gossip. However, he expected to have to
weight his scales against the love in Dice's balance. "I think
you'll find me satisfactory there. I mean to provide for her in my
will, and as a wedding present, do you think she would be satisfied
that I shouldn't press the mortgage I hold on Neangen&mdash;for
sentimental reasons she might like it though it's not very
valuable; or she might prefer Bookaledgeree..." Stanton smiled
slyly in his beard and watched the effect of this.</p>

<p>It winded old Larry, but he was a good poker-player and took
some long puffs on his pipe before replying. Then he knocked out
the ashes and chose a stalk of the lovely trembling grass nodding
its beads by the veranda-post and cleared the stem and puffed and
blew and spat before trusting himself to speak, but he didn't
deceive SP-over-J.</p>

<p>"Well, now, that's rather handsome of you, Jack, but there's
time&mdash;there's plenty of time. We must ask Aily herself. Sure,
I've been keeping you up. Meself I had a snooze this afternoon, but
probably you've been up all day, and not so young as we used to be,
riding after the girls thirty years ago&mdash;or getting on forty
years, isn't it?&mdash;an' the girls not as willing to jump at us
as we could have wished." Old Larry got in his dig. SP-over-J did
not relish it, but said nothing. Larry warbled on, "An' the girls
getting more independent every generation. There's no telling them
what or who they should marry these times."</p>

<p>"Oh well, suppose we call it a day," said Stanton. "You can let
me know in a week's time what you think."</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>From Dice's end the drama proceeded gaily. By noon on the day
following the ball all the township discussed it. The notoriety of
the happenings at the ball and the attentions of Stanton had
established pretty little Aileen as an exciting beauty. Ronald had
youth, the popularity of personal charm, and a crushing mortgage on
his family's property: SP-over-J was never a favourite with men or
maids from his youth, and now age was against him, but he owned
much property. Their handicaps and assets made the men's rivalry
lively entertainment for the onlookers.</p>

<p>As Stanton was riding back to Bool Bool he saw Poole, true to
promise, conducting Aileen to Neangen. With him in the Three Rivers
buggy were his sister Charlotte, Aileen, and Marcia. Behind them
rode a boy to take the buggy back from Bookaledgeree. The boy was
leading Miss Muffet, and Poole's big bay ran tractably on the
off-side of the fat Three Rivers pair. They met where the main road
bounds Bookaledgeree, sloping away to the Yarrabongo on one side
and facing the cool peaks of the Bogongs up the valley of
Bookaledgeree Creek on the other.</p>

<p>"Aileen, are you quite well?" inquired SP-over-J, drawing to the
back seat, where she was sitting.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, thank you, Mr Stanton. It was only a bilious headache.
I am going to ride home from Bookaledgeree."</p>

<p>"I left your colt in charge of young Philip at Three Rivers. I
never handled a better-tempered animal. Anything else was on
account of bad handling, whether intentional or otherwise I don't
wish to say without complete evidence, but I advise you to keep
your eyes open," said Poole.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I'll have more time to explain when we meet again."</p>

<p>"I'm off to Turrill Turrill at once," replied SP-over-J,
watching the effect on Aileen, but she tilted her parasol, and it
was Marcia who was delighted by the radiant relief that lit the
lovely little face.</p>

<p>"Oh well, it can go for the present. We must be getting on or
we'll keep Mrs Dice late for dinner."</p>

<p>SP-over-J did not approve of this descent upon Bookaledgeree,
but in view of family entrenchments did not know what to say. He
thought for a moment of turning in with the buggy, but lacked the
dash, and let the moment pass. He said nothing, deciding to allow
his mortgages to do the talking with old Healey. He dismounted to
shake hands with old Mrs Philip so that he could also shake hands
with Aileen. She was careful to reach across Marcia for that, and
SP-over-J had to be content with, "Well, good-bye for the present,
little girl. Take care of yourself!"</p>

<p>Aileen looked back after him and waved her hand, relief in all
her being. Uncle Jack's words had such delicious significance for
Marcia that she kept digging Aileen in the ribs and repeating
"Little girl, take care of yourself!" in heated whispers. Aileen
accepted this without protest, in the spirit in which it was
tendered. She was a gentle soul.</p>

<p>Her satisfaction in being rid of Stanton was diminished by her
reception by the Dices. Ronald came to meet the buggy as it
approached where he was loading hay from a late crop. He could not
leave his work for longer than a greeting, and when the buggy went
on, Marcia's repetition of "Good-bye, little girl!" increased in
facetious intensity.</p>

<p>"Dear, oh dear!" murmured Bert to his sister in the front seat,
"were we ever as gigglesome as that over nothing when we were
young?"</p>

<p>"You and I weren't, for we had so much trouble and
responsibility that it made us a pair of old sober-sides, but
remember how Grandpa Mazere was always snorting about the silly
'skitting' of the young people."</p>

<p>The watch-dogs of Bookaledgeree announced the visitors, and the
family streamed forth to the stableyard to meet them.</p>

<p>"Well, Charlotte, this is a surprise and honour," said Mrs Dice.
"It's not often you pay us a call. You've only been here once
before, haven't you, when I was ill?" She kissed Marcia and shook
hands with "Miss Healey".</p>

<p>Ida and Olive shook hands with her laughingly. "We have to
congratulate you, haven't we?" said Ida. "When is the wedding to
be?"</p>

<p>Aileen was drowned in blushes, her pulses bounded. Olive's
contribution caused a drop in her temperature. "You must give us
the receipt for turning such a confirmed old bachelor into a gay
young lover, dancing at balls."</p>

<p>Marcia spluttered uncontrollably.</p>

<p>"That's what it is to be the belle of the bridge-opening ball.
Your dress was lovely. No wonder Mr Stanton was finished," added
Ida.</p>

<p>Poole was seeing to the horses. His sister maintained her
habitual non-committal calm.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Healey, it's not fair to pounce on you like that,"
said Mrs Dice. "But it is such a surprise. Jack Stanton has had the
reputation of a woman-hater for so long, but you can never trust
any man where a pretty girl is concerned. I expect your brother
will be the next to collapse and startle us," she turned to
Charlotte.</p>

<p>"I wish he would," said she quietly. "If only he got some nice
woman of a sensible age to take care of him."</p>

<p>"But there'd be no romance in that, would there, Miss Healey?"
cried Ida.</p>

<p>"Come inside into the cool. Isn't it a dreadful drought we're
having? I've never seen the garden so dried up." Mrs Dice went
ahead with Charlotte.</p>

<p>Aileen was bewildered. Hadn't Ronald informed his family, or had
they refused to accept the announcement and were battening down the
engagement with SP-over-J to get rid of her? What was she to do?
"You're all making some mistake or only funning," she said, so near
tears that the murmur was scarcely audible.</p>

<p>She did not see Ronald till they assembled in the dining-room.
Marcia was curious beyond articulation. Aileen looked towards
Ronald appealingly. His face reassured her.</p>

<p>"Aileen, you must sit beside me," he said, but Mrs Dice, who
wielded the carving-knife, thought otherwise.</p>

<p>"No. Charlotte will sit on my left and Bert on my right. You
will go next to Charlotte..."</p>

<p>"All right, and Aileen on the other side."</p>

<p>"Couldn't think of it," cried Ida gaily. "We'd make an enemy of
SP-over-J for life."</p>

<p>"We're not going to care about him. He's only a last year's
stack of hay." Ronald was gayer than Ida.</p>

<p>"Even that won't be sneezed at if this drought doesn't break,"
said Mrs Dice.</p>

<p>"You had better keep me company, Aileen," said Poole kindly, to
succour the girl in her evident distress, and exercising the
privilege he enjoyed in all the houses of the clan.</p>

<p>"That will be lovely," she responded gratefully, slipping into
the seat which Ida had designed for herself, and from which she
could not remove Aileen as Poole laid his hand protectingly on the
back of the chair.</p>

<p>After dinner Aileen felt that the whole household was bent on
preventing her from seeing Ronald alone. She insisted on riding to
Neangen, an arrangement that was accepted because it permitted
Charlotte and Marcia to return to town that afternoon. Ronald put
her on her horse, and while placing his hand for her toe managed to
say, "Aileen, I'm coming up to see your father the day after
tomorrow at latest. I must get this bit of hay in first. We are
short-handed."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ronnie, then it is all right."</p>

<p>"Of course, you silly little chicken, what did you take me
for?"</p>

<p>"I'm so tired of hearing about old SP-over-J. They all act as if
I was engaged to him."</p>

<p>"Let them have all the fun they want. Our turn is coming."</p>

<p>"But you don't know Pa: and what was SP-over-J doing up this
way? He must have been at Neangen."</p>

<p>"Well, he is off to Turrill Turrill without waiting to say his
prayers. That looks as if he jolly well knew his cake is
dough."</p>

<p>"Sssh!"</p>

<p>A touch to Aileen's toe and she was safely in her saddle and
took the reins, which Ronald placed in her fingers with an
enveloping hand-clasp that spoke volumes of reassurance. Good-byes
were repeated, and Aileen rode away in comfort with Curradoobidgee
Poole.</p>

<p>"A pretty little thing," said his sister, who never said unkind
words of any.</p>

<p>"Pretty enough, but dear me, a weak-looking little
creature&mdash;. doesn't seem as if there was much ballast there. I
don't like the breed. I'm surprised at Jack Stanton at his time of
life." Mrs Dice had raised her voice so that Ronald should not miss
a word. He was waving his straw hat to Aileen, looking handsome and
appropriate to the weather in white ducks, hastily donned for
dinner. He went away to change again for his haymaking, pretending
not to hear his mother.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Poole and Aileen journeyed peacefully through the blazing summer
afternoon, delightful beside the singing streams in deep, cool,
fern-clad gullies. Giants of the untouched forests shaded the
winding bush road round the spurs of the Bogongs whence they could
see for miles along the Yarrabongo, now become the Mungee. Its
course was marked by the river gums and draped in blossoming shrubs
away beyond the fish-hole where the <i>Ornithorhyncus paradoxus</i>
romped like dolphins near sunset and reared their young in the
banks.</p>

<p>"I think there can be nothing better than that in the world in
natural scenery, as far as I have seen on the stereoscope,"
remarked Poole.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is pretty, but very lonely," replied Aileen. "So many
hills always seem to smother me, till I am frightened, and the
river sonnds like a great sad wind. I like Monaro much better."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, Monaro beats everything else in the world, I am
sure."</p>

<p>Conversation between thorn was scrappy. Poole was no talker.
Neither was Aileen. She charmed in being softly responsive to the
emanations of others. Not only men of al! ages, but old women found
her delightful for this quality alone. Poole wished to help the
little girl, surronuded completely, as he judged, by persons
neither sympathetic nor helpful, but Aileen gave him no opening. If
young Ronald and she really wanted each other, he reflected, and
their attraction was more than a flash in the pan, they were adults
and surely could take care of themselves. Jack was a fool at his
time of life to come between young people, and deserved to have his
whiskers singed. To be off out of the district in such a hurry was
a good sign, but what had he been doing in the direction of
Neangen? Old Jack was a deep one in a business deal; not many could
outwit him. Perhaps old Larry would let something drop on the
matter.</p>

<p>However, Larry could be as close as SP-over-J when it suited
him, and Poole learnt nothing. Aileen arriving with Poole after a
couple of days with Stanton's niece put Larry in good humour.</p>

<p>"Well, my girl, too much excitement and dissipation," he said
affectionately. "Sure, you'll only be young once, so you do well to
make the best of it." Aileen was relieved hut not deceived by the
family affection poured ont before Poole. She retired to her little
skillion bedroom. Julie, who shared it with her, went too, carrying
her sister's valise.</p>

<p>"How have things been&mdash;any ructions with Pa?"</p>

<p>"My, yes! When Larry and Joanna left you behind with Ronald Dice
mooching round we thought the roof would come off, but it's been
all seganio since old Skinny Guts came up yesterday and fixed
everything up about marrying you."</p>

<p>"Was he here?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He stayed till this morning."</p>

<p>"Fixed up everything&mdash;whatever do you mean?" Aileen felt it
would be heavenly if she could faint till everything was
satisfactory for her and Ronald.</p>

<p>"I listened. I sat inside the door of the drorin'-room in the
dark while SP-over-J and Pa was on the veranda. You'll be awful
rich. I'm going to live with you. Joanna and Norah will be as
jealous as old cats, but I'd rather have Ronald Dice."</p>

<p>Aileen felt as if a steel net were suspended above her.</p>

<p>"Let me have room to dress now, there's a good girl." Julie
departed, desirous of improving her chances with Mr Poole. She
hoped he would give her a pony like the one he had given Milly
Saunders.</p>

<p>Aileen flung herself on the wallaby-skin beside her bed, but
comfort would not come. She did not know how to pray except to
repeat something by rote night and morning. What with the original
Larry's terrific row with the Church, which had resulted in
excommunication, and the second generation having married heretics,
but without adopting a new faith, religion in Larry's family had
degenerated into remnant superstitions more hampering than
helpful.</p>

<p>Catching at present straws, Aileen was thankful for the presence
of Poole for the night and the consequent postponement of her
troubles. All was geniality with old Larry showing off the
affection of his elder daughters and bidding them sing, though it
were better artistically that they first had died. If one daughter
had captured old SP-over-J, the toughest matrimonial nut to crack
in the whole district, another might secure Poole. Neither Joanna
nor Norah had Aileen's looks, but Poole was not so austere as
Stanton, and one match often helped another.</p>

<p>Aileen said good-bye to Poole next morning with a sinking heart,
and he had no sooner been lost from sight than her affectionate
father called her to an interview. He began all right. "Well, Aily
child, you've clone very well for yourself. It will be a great lift
to us all, and you'll be rollin' in silks and luxury ahead of the
whole crew that out of jealousy has tried to snub us."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Pa?" inquired Aileen faintly, wishing the
floor would hide her.</p>

<p>"You want to be a little coy about it, do you, but, sure, Mr
Stanton hasn't let any grass grow under his feet. He wants ye to
name the first day after the New Year. But, sure, ye needn't be too
hurried for a week or two, or maybe a month&mdash;ye've got him in
the palm of your hand, and now's the time to extract the best
turrums." Larry showed the least result of the good governesses
that his mother had secured, and in moments of stress relapsed into
the bog-trotter brogue of his parents.</p>

<p>"But, Pa, I never said I'd marry Mr Stanton. I h&mdash;I don't
like him." Aileen's voice was faint.</p>

<p>"Well, thin, he's so eager that all ye have to do is sit quiet
while I get the most elegant turrums an old man ever laid out for
his darling."</p>

<p>"But, Pa, I don't want any terms from Mr Stanton. He must be
crazy."</p>

<p>"Sure, he's crazy with love, and that's a fine thing in a lover,
especially if he's old and rich."</p>

<p>"But, Pa, he's a horrid, skinny old man, as old as you are."</p>

<p>"Och, that counts nothing in love's young dream."</p>

<p>"But, Pa...Aileen felt impelled to insist upon love's young
dream, but faltered and left it to Ronald. One day more now and he
would be at Neangen. She must stave off talk of Stanton till
then.</p>

<p>"Pa, I don't like Mr Stanton. Please don't plague me about the
horrid old creature." Aileen was rescued by tears. They had more
effect than anything even with old Larry when he was not at bay,
and brought the temporary relief so ardently desired.</p>

<p>"Well, well, now. A little soft excitement is natural. We don't
have to make up our minds about the day in a hurry." He let her go
to her room and commanded the others, "Sure, leave the child be for
a day or two. She's a bit startled about it all for the
present."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said Julie, as the old man left the sisters together in
the kitchen&mdash;they had dispensed with a servant owing to hard
times. "Aileen won't have old Skinny while Ronnie is about, and I
don't blame her. I wouldn't either, would you, Norah?"</p>

<p>"It would depend on whether I loved him."</p>

<p>"Would you, Joanna?"</p>

<p>"You bet I'd love anyone as rich as old SP-over-J, even if it
was Teddy O'Mara. Aileen would be a fool not to jump at such a
chance. She could cover the floor with sovereigns if she
liked."</p>

<p>"You mean if old Skinny liked," said the astute Julie. "I wish
Ronnie had the money. Why is it that nice people have no money and
the rich ones are always nasty?"</p>

<p>"I know lots who arc both poor and nasty," said Joanna, "and I
prefer the rich variety."</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Aileen restlessly awaited Saturday. She expected Ronald about
sundown, but the sun was still high when she began to peer down the
road that showed for half a mile before it disappeared in the
stately timber to reappear as a white gash rounding a spur where
the trees had been cut down beside the telegraph line. Her father,
enjoying his Saturday-afternoon laze on the veranda, was facetious.
"Sure, the mailman will assume great importance, though belike an
old man will talk more through his cheque-hook and leave the
sentimental twaddle to them that has nothing else."</p>

<p>Aileen was relieved to accept the mailman as cover. The hoary
old rascal on his ambling brumby followed by his piebald screw with
the packs did raise the dust round the spur an hour before Ronald,
and brought Aileen a letter in an unfamiliar hand.</p>

<p>"Sure," said old Larry, "is that what you've been lookin' for,
and ye tryin' to persuade me against me senses?"</p>

<p>Aileen went to her bedroom with the letter, but the curious and
indelicate Julie also had right of entry there and plumped herself
on her bed, staring and unabashed. "Aren't you going to open it? Is
it from Ronnie or old Skinny? Show me the writing."</p>

<p>"Do run away and leave me alone."</p>

<p>"I will if you will show me the letter."</p>

<p>Aileen popped it down the front of her gown and ran up the
orchard. Julie pursued, piping shrilly, "Aileen has put her letter
down her front and won't open it."</p>

<p>"You come here or I'll give you a lift under the ear," said Pa,
and Aileen escaped. She got out of the orchard by climbing a
quince-tree, thence to the hay-shed on the hill. Hidden in the
sweet new hay she felt safer and opened the letter, every minute
raising her eyes to that streak on the spur for a delivering
horseman.</p>

<blockquote>STANTON'S PLAINS,<br>
Bool Bool<br>
Thursday Night.<br>
<br>
My Little Darling,<br>
<br>
I hardly know how to begin my first letter to you. There is so much
I should like to say to you and tell you but I will make it short
as I must be away at daybreak to Riverina. This is not the season
for a man to neglect his business and I must attend to business
more than ever now so that I can give you everything that your
little heart desires. After you said the wonderful words which made
me such a lucky man on Tuesday night, I went home hardly believing
it could be true and that I a somewhat older man could have such a
prize ahead of young fellows full of poetry and sentimentality.<br>
<br>
I was sorry I could not see you next morning but I wasted no time
but rode straight up to see your father, which I think was the
right thing to do. I was on my way back when I met you with the
Pooles today and was glad to see that you had quite recovered.
Well, as you will know before this reaches you, I had a nice talk
with your father and you will be happy to know that he offers no
objections at all and was most welcoming to me and willing to trust
his little girl to me. The only thing now is for you to name the
day that will make me an even happier man than I am now, and I want
it to be as soon after New Year as possible. I am eager to have my
little darling in a position where I can give her all that her
little heart desires...</blockquote>

<p>There were pages and pages. SP-over-J, like many silent people,
babbled like a brook on paper, those uninteresting weedy brooks in
flat country. Aileen, looking up for the fifteenth time, saw the
desired figure, and slipped behind bushes safe from observation
across the cow paddock to the highway. The approaching horseman
flung off his shying beast with extravagant athleticism when he was
yet some yards distant.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ronnie, I thought you'd never come! I never want to part
from you again," she exclaimed, her cheek against his, her arms
tight round his neck.</p>

<p>"Tell me, darling."</p>

<p>"It has been terrible. You heard them all at Bookaledgeree, and
it has been the same ever since. Everyone has it settled that I am
engaged to old SP-over-J, and the mailman has brought me a letter
from him yards long. Oh, Ronnie, you'd think I was married to him
already to read it. What am I to do?"</p>

<p>"Put his old screed in the fire and tell him to go and bag his
old head. If he can't take a hint he'll have to be given a good
bump."</p>

<p>"I've been careful not to stir up things, but I'm afraid of
trouble with Pa, and your mother did not seem to want me."</p>

<p>"We can't let fathers or mothers stand in our way. We aren't
children."</p>

<p>"I'll slip back through the horse paddock now."</p>

<p>"No fear! You aren't ashamed of me, are you?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, but there will be such ructions."</p>

<p>"The more the merrier if only things are settled. Come on, let's
gamely open the ball." He tucked her arm in his, but the ewlogs,
accepting Aileen's introduction, failed to make a noise and no one
witnessed their approach. They had to go right inside to be seen.
Old Healey said "Good evening" cordially. He was never
inhospitable. Young Larry inquired, "Did you put your horse in the
stable?"</p>

<p>"No, I hung him up."</p>

<p>"You're not making home tonight?"</p>

<p>"No. I came specially to see Aileen and your father."</p>

<p>"Good! I'll let your horse out." People liked young Larry. He
was genial and obliging.</p>

<p>Supper was an uneasy meal to Aileen with delight and fear
intermingled. Joanna and Norah looked on enviously. The "ructions"
element of having a lover one loved would not have weighed so
heavily on them as did the lack of all but dud eligibles. One such
arrived a few minutes later than Dice. He had been teetering round
for ages. The family could not decide whether it was Norah or
Joanna he favoured, but Norah had the more patience so to her he
was credited. Old Larry said he only wanted a place whereat to
spend Saturday night in the summer. This was Alf Timson, son of old
Timson of Wombat Hill, Monaro, a bachelor ten years younger than
Larry p&egrave;re, who managed a summer station at Billy-go-Billy
twenty miles up the Jenningningahama. He was of the early pioneer
families and better than nothing. He followed all the motions of
other men, but lacked style. He was useful now to preserve
normality, and in the drawing-room after dinner kept his end up by
singing "Juanita" in a reedy drawl with his eyes closed. He stuck
to his host after the singing for a good-night pipe. Ronald did
likewise. Old Healey talked politics.</p>

<p>"Damn old sleepy sawney Alf! Why the deuce can't he make himself
scarce?" thought Dice, but at last was forced to retire, and to the
same room as Alfred, without having put his case.</p>

<p>He rose early, but Alf also forwent beauty sleep, while old
Healey took a treble share. Ronald saw that opportunity had to be
made. They rode out during the morning to see some travelling sheep
pass to a station farther up the Jenningningahama and Dice said,
"Mr Healey, I came up to have a few words with you about an
important matter. Will you come on ahead, now?"</p>

<p>"Sure, you're free to say anything to me you like."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr Healey, Aileen and I have made up our minds to get
married and I thought I'd like a talk with you about it."</p>

<p>"You've made up your minds, you say, you don't mean Aileen
has?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I do. Aileen has made me very happy by returning my
affection. I have her promise and we want your goodwill so that we
can publish the engagement."</p>

<p>"Hold on, now, not so fast. What has Aileen said that makes you
think this?"</p>

<p>"Everything that is necessary, Mr Healey."</p>

<p>"This is rather complicated. Stanton of Turrill Turrill has been
before you with a very open-handed offer to make handsome provision
for my daughter. What provision do you propose to make? How much of
Bookaledgeree can you settle on your wife?"</p>

<p>"I haven't had time to accumulate old SP-over-J's money-bags
yet, but Aileen prefers love in a cottage to begin, and long before
I'm old Skinny's age we'll have more than we need."</p>

<p>"You'll soon find that this love in a cottage is no match for
the bailiff. Sure, this love they talk about doesn't last over the
honeymoon, but a good solid property and money in the bank is the
greatest comfort there is to the young and the old all their lives.
The longer they're married the more firmly they'll find out the
truth of that."</p>

<p>"Money is a handy thing to have about the house, all right, but
it's not the chief thing at this stage of the game. It is much more
that Aileen and I are cut out for each other and don't mind how
much hard work is ahead of us."</p>

<p>"That sounds very fine, but, me lad, have ye anything to call
your own at all?" Larry's own financial plight enabled him to put
his finger unerringly on Dice's. Foot by foot he exposed the young
man's prospects as having nothing more solid than hope behind them,
hope founded more on optimism than business acumen. Everything was
Mrs Dice's, mortgaged over the limit, and in bad repair. Even the
horse Ronald rode could not have been separated from the estate in
the event of foreclosure. The case of Bookaledgeree was that of
Neangen only that Mrs Dice's was the more valuable property. It was
nearer to town and had more detimbered acreage, though where the
scrub had been extirpated, briars high as houses and denser than a
wall with tearing thorns had taken its place.</p>

<p>Driven in a corner, Ronald said, "At any rate, Aileen and I
think a tremendous lot of each other. It would be a sin and a shame
for either of us to think of anyone else, feeling as we do. Aileen
is nearly twenty-three and I am going on for twenty-four, so we
hope, even though you think we are foolish, that we shall have your
consent and good wishes."</p>

<p>"No child of mine would have my consent to sacrifice herself to
poverty while every luxury was waiting for her. It is my duty as a
father to see to that. This talk about love is not worth that,"
said Healey, snapping his fingers. "People ought to be held down
for such lunacy while common sense is left to those surrounding
them, so I'd thank you to say no more of this to Aileen."</p>

<p>"You surely wouldn't want Aileen to marry without the proper
affection, no matter how much money the man had?"</p>

<p>"In this case Aileen will be thankin me a year from now. She is
an innocent little gurrl and doesn't know her own mind. There are
plenty others, you go pick one of them now like a sensible fellow.
Why not one of those young Saunderses or Stantons with h nice
little nest-egg behind them belike, and leave Aily be. 'Tis the
chance of her life. Sure, she doesn't know her own mind. She's a
trifle bemoidered with all the fuss and attention, a modestly
reared little gurrl like she is!"</p>

<p>"She's a grown woman. Let us have her tell us herself what she
wishes when we go back to the house."</p>

<p>"Sure, 'tis no good of askin' them that's got the fever. 'Tis
those lookin' on knows their foolish state."</p>

<p>He did not forbid Dice the house nor adopt an unfriendly
attitude towards him. On the contrary Dice now found it as
difficult to escape from his host as before it had been to take him
aside. The presence of Timson was also unremitting. Curses upon the
gawky booby!</p>

<p>He managed a few words with Aileen at parting. "Send that silly
letter back to the old Death Adder and tell him he is barking up
the wrong stump. Your father doesn't believe you care for me and
thinks you would be happier with the money-bags. You must convince
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ronnie, Pa is only pretending. I'd rather live in a
salt-shed or a tent with you than at Government House with that
horrid skinny old thing."</p>

<p>"Then you must be firm. Take no notice of the Death Adder's
letters after you let him know that he is making a fool of himself.
Just wait patiently, no matter what anyone says. I could put up a
little two-roomed humpy on the other side of the river for us to
begin."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ronnie, that would be divine!"</p>

<p>"All right, then, you go and write a letter making that as plain
as the old strawberry bull and give it to me so we can be sure it
is posted."</p>

<p>She did as bidden. She returned SP-over-J's effusion with many
thanks and stated her regret that anything she had said in the
embarrassment of being disturbed by Marcia and Amy had made him
think what he expressed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>Aileen's missive, gently worded, caused SP-over-J to write short
incisive business letters to the bank and old Larry. Woe to young
love when old love puts on golden spurs.</p>

<p>Stanton stated his inability to understand so inconsistent and
heart-breaking an attitude&mdash;many sheets. He detailed his
luxurious plans for Aileen&mdash;promises and offers that left all
other lovers at the starting post.</p>

<p>Aileen wrote to Ronald. Her father intercepted the letter. There
was in that locality no pillar-box with the Government as
accomplice. Aileen had to depend upon others, and learnt how
undependable others could be from her point of view, how careless
of the axiom about a shut mouth and the flies. Her father forbade
her to write to Stanton unless the letter met his ideas. He took
her to Monaro and put her in charge of his sister Joanna.</p>

<p>This change was better for Aileen and she got a letter posted.
Ronald was making a desperate effort to pull Bookaledgeree
together. The season favoured him. Even Bookaledgeree was dry, the
creeks lower than they had been for years, but stock can hold out
indefinitely in hot weather with plenty of water, and the wicked
briars proved a stand-by. The brassy unyielding skies were
spreading an old-man drought on Old Man Plain, and all the plains
north and west of Riverina to Bourke and Broken Hill and the great
nor'-west. This meant profits from agistment to those who held runs
in the mountain country, and the Dices benefited, though only
slightly compared with their liabilities.</p>

<p>The place being stocked to the limit, the young men were
full-handed. Ronald slogged all the week. The dilapidated dog-leg
fences, which had not been replaced by split rail nor even stud
fences, while the progressive had taken to posts and wire, entailed
vigilant boundary-riding to keep sojourning stock from invading
neighbouring runs. But on Saturday afternoon arrived the weekly
razor hour and dressing-up prior to gallivanting, and there was
nothing to prevent a hardy energetic young man in love from taking
the track beaten years before when other Monaro or Bool Bool lovers
had come and gone by the channel of the Jenningningahama.</p>

<p>By starting immediately after dinner on the Saturday following
Aileen's removal, Ronald arrived under Poole's window by
daylight.</p>

<p>"How's Aileen?" he inquired after waking his host.</p>

<p>"Asleep, I reckon, unless she's listening for you."</p>

<p>"Great Scott! is she here? That's luck."</p>

<p>Aileen had insisted upon paying her respects to old Mrs Poole,
now nearly eighty-six, since Mr Poole had been so kind as to wait
in Bool Bool and bring her home after the ball. She found her
cousin Sheila amenable to her purpose, for she had a fancy for one
of the young Pooles. Both girls revelled in their luck in being
allowed to spend the week-end at Curradoobidgee.</p>

<p>"Have you knocked SP-over-J out of the running?"</p>

<p>"He's never been in as far as I am concerned. Aileen can't abide
the old Death Adder. Old Larry is after the money-bags, of course.
Let him go and marry 'em himself, if he wants 'em."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Poole equably. "You and Aileen are both of age, and
if you care for each other in the right way you need not let
anything block you."</p>

<p>"We don't mean to."</p>

<p>"More power to you! Old Jack, I reckon, will recover. There are
plenty candidates for the job of missus of Turrill Turrill, much
nearer his own age. I reckon an old man takes no end of a jump in
the dark to marry a young girl. Don't you want some grub? And turn
in till breakfast. There's a spare bed in the next room."</p>

<p>"Thanks! I put the horses in the orchard. I'm awfully glad you
are on my side. Would you mind not mentioning my visit or Aileen's
to anyone who would take it back to Neangen or the old Death
Adder."</p>

<p>"I shan't spread the news. There will be plenty others to spare
me the trouble. So long! See you at breakfast."</p>

<p>The young folks had a merry Sunday and in the evening Dice had
the felicity of riding part of the way with Aileen towards her aunt
Joanna. Sheila did not mention Dice's presence at Curradoobidgee.
The lovers were safe for the moment.</p>

<p>The following Saturday Ronald followed the same procedure.
Aileen was not at Curradoobidgee this time, so after breakfast
Ronald rode over to Aunt Joanna's. Joanna Healey had married one of
the Gilberts, and the pair had settled on the outward flanges of
Gowandale, which adjoined Poole's. Aileen had had a letter asking
her to meet Ronald without the family's cognizance, but the
exigencies of bush homes were such that she could not wander forth
for hours without being missed and arousing microscopic curiosity.
Ronald had to ride boldly up to the selection and call upon the
family.</p>

<p>He was received cordially enough. Aileen appeared without any
fuss among her cousins and with her Aunt Joanna&mdash;particularly
with her Aunt Joanna, who had received instructions. Aileen was
chaperoned to look at the flower garden and perambulate the
orchard. Ronald lacked the training to carry on an impassioned yet
private declaration in the teeth of a duenna as Latin beaux can do.
He had to be content with whispering over a rose-bush, "You'll have
to write to me."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Pa has got on to us and there is no hope. Aunt
Joanna is on his side."</p>

<p>Alf Timson had recognized the tracks of Dice's horse up past
Billy-go-Billy, and, sheepish though he was, found it amusing to
mention at Neangen. Young Larry, too, was yet unscathed so had
neither sentimentality nor sympathy concerning young love. The
money-bags were more attractive to him and he did not enjoin
silence upon Alf, so when for the third time Ronald tested his
horse with that stiff journey he did not find Aileen.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>It was not so simple as Poole suggested. The bridge was opened
in the middle of November, and by Christmas Ronald and Aileen's
love affair had become succulent news from Monaro to Bool Bool. The
male wits had bets on it; the women took sides, and most of them
were for Ronald and against SP-over-J for interfering with young
love's dream. The Stantons objected to the Healeys. The Dices were
also firmly against having Aileen in the family. Aileen's mother,
the second Mrs Larry, was only a boundary-rider's daughter. Worse,
her father had been demented in his later clays, and his wife had
had to take a stock-whip to him to get him out of bed. He grew
violent and there were gruesome stories of the numbers of men it
had taken to hold him towards the end. His madness was attributed
to the effects of drink on a head badly damaged by sun-stroke, and
he was safely dead, but there were partisans to point out now that
Mrs Healey's brother, a drover down the Bland, was a weird specimen
too, as mad as a meat-axe though he had never been sun-struck. Some
said Mrs Healey herself was a poor weak sort of a creature, others
maintained that that was all anyone could be with old Larry. Some
detractors said that Aileen was lacking in get-up-and-go, but these
were all over thirty, and women at that. Aileen had merely to
appear in one of the fairy dresses she made so cleverly and her
unarmed gentleness set men and younger maids a-raving.</p>

<p>There was little unknown to those two high priestesses of family
history in Bool Bool, the Mayoress and Mrs Isaacs, their penchant
for news being aided by their respective callings. What one did not
hear by way of gossip at the bar when whisky let discretion out,
the other discovered or had corroborated in friendly confidence in
the back room where accounts were settled over wine and
cake&mdash;Mrs Isaacs always kept this part of the business in her
own hands. Thus everything came to light as authentically as
possible with mutable human affairs. There was also a great deal of
gossip among the Mayor and Corporation.</p>

<p>"Sure, they've been tellin' me that ould Larry has sint Aileen
off to Sydney to his brother Dinny," observed Mrs M'Haffety to Mrs
Isaacs. "Young Ronald was trapesing up to Monaro wan Saturday night
afther the other."</p>

<p>"Aileen will be able to write to Ronald from Sydney, unless they
keep her under lock and key."</p>

<p>"That's there. I wonder will the young people win."</p>

<p>"Not they. They'd make a nice pair if they had everything laid
out for them, but they lack the backbone. I was told for a fact
that SP-over-J has the mortgages on both Neangen and Bookaledgeree,
and that puts old Larry against Ronald."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say the ould jew lizard is quoite as mean as
that!"</p>

<p>"You don't know as much as I do about people when it's a matter
of money. Old Healey would sell his mother, and the Dices are not
going to be turned out of house and home for a girl they are dead
against in any case. Old Jack has both families properly bailed
up."</p>

<p>"What a pity for the young people. Poor darlints!"</p>

<p>"They could run away if they liked. Look at me and Jacob. We
hadn't a penny and had to help keep our parents and the younger
ones. Jacob started out with a pound's worth of goods on his back
in a box, and look at us today!"</p>

<p>"But thim days has gone. Sure, Aileen and Ronald couldn't start
on a pound hawking a few rags."</p>

<p>"Well then, let them put up with the other circumstances," said
Rebecca firmly. "If people are above making their own fortune they
will have to do as they are told by those with money."</p>

<p>Aileen found alleviation in her banishment to Sydney. Aunt
Dennis was not averse from having her: she was a dainty bait in the
hotel trade. She spoke to her niece solidly. "If the old Death
Adder, as you call him, makes you sick in spite of his money, and
the young one hasn't a penny, and seems to be a thriftless sort who
will never put much together, now is your chance to forget him and
escape the old lizard, or whatever he is, by choosing a young one
that you can marry with pleasure, as well as him having the
spondulics."</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't forget Ronnie!"</p>

<p>"That's what all the girls think at first, but looking back
after a few years I bet the half of them wonder why; and all this
fuss about old Stanton's money&mdash;-has he got so much when all
is said and done? I suppose your father thinks anything big above a
spring-cart and those wombat holes about Little River, and I
believe Neangen is much worse. Some of those old squatters, who are
such big potatoes in the bush, are only very mangy cockatoos in
Sydney or Melbourne. When I was in business in Goulburn"&mdash;she
had been barmaid at the Commercial, the smart hotel of its
day&mdash;"I thought the Healeys were somebody, especially when
they bought Eueurunda, the talk of the day. God save me, I was
never in such a forlorn hole in my life. As for those old frumps at
Gowandale and Curradoobidgee, horrors preserve me from them! My
Ellie and Aileen have both made fine town matches, and I advise you
to do the same. Two of my barmaids also married real rich
fellows&mdash;one of them living in a mansion at Potts Point, and
neither of those girls, nor my own either, had half your good
looks. Wake up! You don't want to be a bushwhacker all your
life."</p>

<p>Mrs Healey was an independent mind. She had earned her own
living before she married, and supported her family after her
husband's crash (old Denny was a pitiable wreck, with a male
attendant), not in a noble way of life it is true, but she had a
good name in a legitimized business, one of few open to her sex at
that date.</p>

<p>"Marry if you get the chance," she continued. "I shouldn't worry
about saving the family. They're all big and strong enough to look
after themselves, and if SP-over-J is like a lot of old shell-backs
I've seen in my time, the family may not get anything out of him in
any case."</p>

<p>Aileen said little in response to this plain wisdom. In spite of
numerous admirers of her beauty and the excitement of her first
experience of city life in lively surroundings, she was heartsick
for Ronald. He wrote her impassioned screeds and she replied in
similar key, but he could not leave the stock in the present season
to visit her.</p>

<p>From this point of vantage, and adjured by Ronald, she also
wrote something to SP-over-J. He instantly put the screw on old
Larry, who wrote fiercely to Mrs Dennis for allowing Aileen to
carry on a correspondence, but she had the truculent independence
of sisters-in-law who feel their marriage has not been the bargain
they fancied, and told Larry she was not a jailer, and if he was
not satisfied with Aileen's behaviour he was free to superintend it
himself.</p>

<p>Aileen returned to Neangen after a matter of days; she had not
the backbone to accept her aunt's offer to remain in the hotel and
defy her parents, and craved only to be in the neighbourhood of
Ronald.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Ronald found it impossible to see her or communicate with her at
Neangen. Gossip grew to a storm. Tommy Roper, horse-fancier and
raconteur, returned to Ten Creeks from Riverina, whither he had
gone to remove stock for Stanton, and had a good yarn with Flash
Billy, who was minding his bits and training tackle carefully these
days to the end that certain things might blow over now that the
boss was away at Turrill Turrill and had his mind otherwise
occupied.</p>

<p>Billy hoped for his part that the old man pulled it off with the
Healey jam-puff. "She wouldn't he so &mdash;&mdash; interfering as
that long-nosed old hag of a Lucy."</p>

<p>"It won't help you the littlest bit," said Tommy. "Might be
outer the fryin' pan into the &mdash;&mdash; fire. Ole Lucy has
raised such &mdash;&mdash; hell with old Skinny Guts about the
Healey filly&mdash;'fraid she would lose her nosebag and
roof&mdash;that I heerd ole Skinny got her to call her dogs off of
him by swearin' that she shall allers be left to poke her nose
inter things on Ten Creeks while the happy married couple is at
Turrill Turrill, and vizzy-versa, as the cove said. Old Skinny had
to butter her up about bein' a great manager&mdash;as good as Mrs
Labosseer at Coolooluk by his make-out&mdash;an' she is to save him
from the thieves and robbers by which he is surrounded, them bein'
you and Long Billy. It stan's to reason that ole Skinny will want
to cart his new missus down to Riverina to be outer reach of Ron
Dice&mdash;the dandy bloke&mdash;an' you'll have ole Lucy summer
an' winter to make your miserable little life happy."</p>

<p>"Blind him! I hope he can't git her. I hope she elopes with
young Ron the night afore the weddin'."</p>

<p>"The night after would be more fun to them lookin' on."</p>

<p>"I think it's pretty stinkin' of a man to git a girl by holdin'
his mortgages over the head of her family and the family of her
lover, straight wire, I do. Serve him right if he fell off his
horse an' broke his neck."</p>

<p>"No &mdash;&mdash; fear of him loin' that. It's the sort of
thing that happens to innercent little blokes like you an' me."</p>

<p>"I heard that everyone has tried to call ole Skinny off. They
even tol' ole Great-gran'ma Mazere, an' they don't worry her about
much these days, an' she's a reel ole daisy, offered to help Ron
with one of her farms or somethink, but his ma is the old lady's
niece and put her off, as they don't want Ron tied up with the
Healeys and old mother Healey's lunatic taint."</p>

<p>"Good iron wingey! for the ole woman. I wonder if she'd help me
if I pitched a pitiful skyte. But it's ole Larry is the pill to
swaller. It would take thousan's to pull him outer the hole an keep
him above water."</p>

<p>"Mv cripes, I wonder why Ronald doesn't carry Aileen off. I
heerd the ole man keeps her locked up an' beat her, an' that she's
got a fever. He might send her off her chump. Ron's been ridin' up
to Neangen every night, an' old Larry comes out with a gun to him.
Things is pretty hot, all right."</p>

<p>"My cripes! You're right! I heerd as I come through Bool Bool
that Ron took no notice er the old goanna, thought he wouldn't pull
the trigger, but he shot the horse from under him, an' threatened
he would shoot him just as quick if he come again."</p>

<p>"My cripes, you don't mean it!"</p>

<p>"It's a fact. My &mdash;&mdash; Continental, it is."</p>

<p>"When did this happen?"</p>

<p>"The night afore last."</p>

<p>"What horse was it?"</p>

<p>"Spondulix."</p>

<p>"Spondulix! My cripes, what a loss. What did young Ron do about
it?"</p>

<p>"He couldn't do nothink. Had to leave him there."</p>

<p>"He was reel dead?"</p>

<p>"Dead as mutton when it's in the cask a week. Ron picked up his
saddle an' walked away. The old goanna didn't shoot while he was
walkin' away."</p>

<p>"Did he hoof it all the way to Bookaledgeree?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about that, but the other come through ole Alf
Timson. He was down in Bool Bool to meet some sheep."</p>

<p>"Sly ole sawney, Alf; is he still after Joanna?"</p>

<p>"Norah, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"How the devil do I know? He don't know himself. What is ole
Skinny doin' to keep his end up?"</p>

<p>"Sendin' fat letters every week to the girl an' thin little ones
to the ole man. The mailman let it out to ole Billy
Prendergast."</p>

<p>"I'll betcher there's more business in one of them little
letters to ole Larry than in all the fat ones put together."</p>

<p>"We ain't got any way of provin' it."</p>

<p>"What'll be the end, do you think?"</p>

<p>"If Ron can't git some way of takin' the girl by force, like a
feller I onct saw in a play-actin' piece in Sydney, when I took
them Cuppinbingle horses down to Kiss's Bazaar, ole Skinny an'
Larry between them has the weddin' arranged to take place under the
nose of everyone in Bool Bool at New Year."</p>

<p>"Go on! You don't mean it! It'd be a lark if the two ole blokes
could only marry each other, as they're so shook on it. My cripes,
that would be fun! If there could only be some way of palmin' ole
Larry off on ole Skinny instead of the filly, an' when they got to
their room...Good iron wingey! Ha! Ha! Ha! Hal Haw! Haw! Haw! Haw!
He! He! He! He! He! He! He! Ho! Ho! I could bust me sides thinkin'
er that!"</p>

<p>"What's the good er thinkin' er what won't never happen. After
all, ole Skinny deserves to win in a way: he's made up his
mine."</p>

<p>"My cripes, you're right! If I wanted a girl that had, I'd have
her anyway. I can't understand anyone gettin' so worked up over ole
Joanna or Norah, can you?"</p>

<p>"No. Women an' horses is jes' the same. It's this way..." Their
confidences of equine amours grew unfit to chronicle and beyond the
immediate action of this narrative.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p>The romance of Bool Bool had ripened richly in the short time
between Aileen's return from Sydney and the afternoon that Tommy
Roper and Flash Billy discussed it on the meat blocks near Ten
Creeks stables. It was true that Ronald had put his case before old
Mrs Mazere, and that his mother had checkmated him there. She
withheld mercy on account of the impecuniosity of the Healeys and
because the breed was in bad odour with the clan. She worked upon
Great-grandma with regard to the alleged mental taint on Aileen's
maternal side. Jane Dice was not so sympathetic to young love that
she would risk being turned out of Bookaledgeree by crossing the
mortgagor and being left with a distasteful daughter-in-law in
addition to her other worries.</p>

<p>The drought in Riverina was not so urgent to SP-over-J as his
personal affairs, so he returned to Bool Bool. Old Mrs Mazere
summoned him to her. She was a fearless old mother of her tribe and
servant of the Lord, according to her lights, and spoke plainly
about the danger of perpetuating a bad mental strain.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you have been listening to spiteful gossip," said
Stanton calmly and respectfully. It was not the custom round Bool
Bool to resent old Mrs Mazere's advice. "I have investigated the
matter, and it seems plain to me that Mrs Healey's father went off
his head only because of delirium tremens and a sun-stroke. That
sort of thing can't be inherited. Even so, it might skip Aileen.
She would have more chance with me than dragging along in poverty
and worry..."</p>

<p>"It's the children. Parents take on a heavy responsibility
before God."</p>

<p>"I come from a hardy practical strain, and it would take a lot
to send old Larry Healey off his head, I should judge."</p>

<p>"The Healeys have sometimes failed in moral principle and are
irreligious&mdash;they are neither fish nor herrings. Yoke not
yourself with the ungodly, my boy."</p>

<p>"I should never think of calling Aileen ungodly. I'm sure she
will make a great little churchgoer as soon as we are married."</p>

<p>"Marriage, my boy, is for better or worse."</p>

<p>"If it should be worse instead of better I am better placed than
a thriftless fellow to face things."</p>

<p>"But you surely wouldn't force a girl to marry you against her
will?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry you have been told malicious tales. Aileen accepted
me before there was any thought of Ronald. He had every chance, and
there was never a squeak out of him till f had fixed it all tip
both with the girl and her father. I watched them together at Ten
Creeks during the muster and they took no interest in each other,
but as soon as I honourably announce my intentions, he goes off his
onion like a dog with a bait. You notice his mother doesn't take
him seriously!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure, John, I only know what I've been told. You must
excuse an old woman for meddling, but I have seen you grow tip, and
we are nearly all gone now&mdash;your mother and father..."</p>

<p>"I am glad you have spoken to me, because I am able to tell you
about the facts. You've been told fish-yarns. I mean to do
everything for the little girl."</p>

<p>The old lady, her face criss-crossed by sun-cut wrinkles
deepened by nearly fourscore years, looked at him out of honest
eyes that had never issued a furtive glance, and placed her frail
knotted hand, brown as a mummy's, on his sleeve. "Ronald came to
rue in distress, so I sent for you, and you have been good enough
to come too: there is only one thing more. I should like the girl
to come and stay with me here, and tell me the truth, so that I
could judge if this thing is seemly or not. I should like her to be
with me in the presence of both you and Ronald. Will you bring her
to me and leave her with me for a few days?"</p>

<p>"I should like to, but it depends upon the girl herself and her
parents. At any rate, thank you, Mrs Mazere."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, John. The Lord bless you and keep you always, and
guide you and yours in His way."</p>

<p>SP-over-J backed out. He mounted his fine horse and rode out of
town, not towards Stanton's Plains. He wanted a longer, harder
ride, and felt too ruffled to go to Neangen. He decided to ride
straight through to Ten Creeks though the day was already far gone.
It would suit his mood to surprise that lot of crawlers and sharks,
sponging on him and eating their mutton heads off.</p>

<p>Old Mrs Mazere was too genuine, too kind for anything but
respect. It was that crawling, whining, squealing mongrel Dice that
incensed him. Stanton's awakened blood seethed with the fury of
senile passion after protracted quiescence. Mrs Mazere's
intercession hardened his determination to anger. Aileen he would
have, alive or dead, willing or protesting.</p>

<p>He reviewed his sex loves. Adolescent fancy had first been
awakened by Rachel Mazere of Three Rivers, her of Coolooluk these
days, Simon Labosseer's widow. Losing her to Simon left no scar.
Deeper emotions had speedily been stirred by Mary Brennan of The
Gap, sister of old Tim, who reigned there now.</p>

<p>Ah, that was a different affair! He could still picture Mary,
regal, glowing, altogether lovely with her crown of hair like new
copper tinged with red, and generous disposition to match her
splendid proportions; and oh, the kindness of her soft Irish heart
that warmed and melted him like the sun! There never was another
like Mary. She could turn a man into a saint.</p>

<p>Yet she would not be kind to him. It was Bert Poole of
Curradoobidgee that she had loved. With all her generous warm
nature she would not be kind to him, Jack Stanton, no, not even
after all hope in Bert's direction had been killed by his
engagement to Emily Mazere. No, rather than take him, Jack, she
became a nun, forsook the world and died young, the legend for all
to read on her headstone at The Gap.</p>

<p>After that there had been episodes with other women, sordid
episodes out of which he never came with credit or satisfaction,
being too cautious and lacking in generosity, so he had given the
king of indoor sports a rest this good ten years till a sudden
conflagration was started by Aileen Healey. This tormenting madness
had not racked him for years, and honour, friendship,
mercy&mdash;it mattered not what&mdash;could go into the discard so
long as he could satisfy desire.</p>

<p>Recalling his past defeats he felt savage. He would not in his
old days again he among the ruck and a laughing stock, no matter
what it cost in mercy and money. Of the old folks who had seen him
go a-courting nearly forty years before, only old Mrs Mazere and
the M'Haffetys, the Isaacs, and a few tradespeople survived. There
remained his immediate contemporaries, who had ridden with him
where welcome lights of tallow candles and great log fires and
bright eyes shone from the old homesteads at the full or dark of
the moon, in the heat of summer or the nipping frosts of winter.
Foremost of these had been Poole. He too was still unwed, but it
was much more romantic that one's bride should have been drowned
just after the engagement was announced, than for one's love to
take the veil rather than accept him; and Poole seemed obtuse to
matrimonial opportunity or sensual urge, and content to fool about
as uncle-in-general to the younger generation.</p>

<p>He laughed aloud, scaring a drove of wallabies from Wamgambril
Flats, and whistled once more to his muzzled dogs that persisted in
calling attention to the endless possums in endless trees till they
were hoarse and footsore. Curlews and plovers wailed about the
bridle-tracks, and away up the deep cleft that let Corroboree Creek
through from Mount Corroboree, black and forbidding, he could hear
the dingoes howling. The night was cool and crisp, heaven after the
heat of Riverina, purified by the aroma of hundreds of miles of
undespoiled eucalyptus forests with a rippling creek every mile or
two&mdash;his native habitat, no other country to compare with it!
Drought could not reach here. In years to come this would be the
choicest part of Australia. All the night voices suited his mood,
from the wind-like music of the streams to the howl of the dingoes
and the clack of his horse's hoofs striking fire on the flinty
ledges.</p>

<p>He thought of Aileen, and what old Mrs Mazere suggested about
taking her to Three Rivers for observation. Hang it all, they acted
as if he were an ogre, while all the time he was giving the girl
the opportunity of a generation. A dozen other women would leap at
it. Not for any money would he risk inviting either Joanna or Norah
Healey, nor yet Ida or Olive Dice, or half a dozen others about
Bool Bool to be his wife; and there was a widow adjoining Turrill
Turrill who had done everything but ask him point-blank to marry
her. Rose and Flora Farquharson, too, of Keba, were always riding
up the Coolgarbilli to see their friend, Mrs Bob Milford, because
her girlhood's home adjoined theirs, but SP-over-J slyly noted that
they invariably came via Ten Creeks Run, though over the river
there was a better track direct to Jinninjinninbong. Nevertheless,
behind this full field of possibilities again rose Mary Brennan's
ghost. Mary would not have him on any terms when he was young, and
Rachel Mazere, pretty as a fairy in those days, had laughed at him
too, and taken Simon Labosseer, the Dutchman, who had been
considered inconceivably ancient at thirty. He had thought of Mrs
Labosseer again during her early widowhood when she was still in
the thirties, but instinct had warned him that she would be no more
amenable than she had been in her teens, and he had persuaded
himself that the barrier was the children. He was not the kind of
softy to sweat his eyeballs out for another man's brats!</p>

<p>He was often swept by rage against Aileen. In his sane moments
he estimated that all the blame could not be laid on Dice's
caterwaulings. He and the public must have some fuel for their fire
in Aileen's attitude. Mary Brennan would not take him when young,
Aileen was considered a martyr to be taken by him though he was not
yet sixty, as active as anyone, and rich. His heart hardened. He
would not allow her to escape and fool him now as he had been
fooled when callow. To do his better side justice, he would then be
overcome by senile fondness. He would make such a pet of the little
thing, dress her like a doll, make a queen of her, so that she
could not help being happy, and the envy of the country.</p>

<p>Ten Creeks homestead spread before him in the dawn. The season's
foals and their dams were waking on the river flats, and perfumed
blue smoke was curling from the kitchen chimney of rough logs. Long
Billy was saving his reputation by disturbing the milking cows from
their beauty sleep on the clover patches. The sun kissed the peaks
over the river and threw back the reflection onto Mount Corroboree
as he descended a little stiffly from the saddle, flung the reins
to the waiting rouseabout and went inside to see if Lucy and Milly
were up.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Ronald put his case before Poole and appealed for his influence
in saving Aileen. Poole had also seen Aileen's tears. He knew the
Healey side of the case intimately, and had the temperament to make
a more just and moderate estimate of it than anyone, and he so
little liked the attitude of his youth's companion, that despite
principles against meddling he felt impelled to say something to
him. Hearing that Stanton was back in the district he found
business to bring him to Bool Bool and then thought it would be
nice to see how Milly was getting on at Ten Creeks, and rode round
that way. He was alone with his host in the evening when Milly had
been banished to bed and Mr Blenkinsop was setting her a literary
exercise in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>"Don't you think, Jack, that you and I have left it so long that
we had better leave marriage alone altogether now? Aileen's a
taking little thing, but rather a child."</p>

<p>"What the devil have my affairs to do with you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all to do with me, Jack, merely an interested
bystander. I've known you for a good many years, and, of course, I
can't shut my ears to all the talk. Some of it isn't nice."</p>

<p>"If you are going soft, and like to make a billy-goat of
yourself listening to the old women."</p>

<p>"It's not only the old women, it's the generation that has grown
up since our day. They have a right to their point of view about
those of their own age. If the girl was willing, I should not say
anything about the difference in age."</p>

<p>"That mongrel has been squealing to you. If I offered him a few
quid I bet you'd hear no more about his love affairs&mdash;not with
Aileen. He needn't think he's dealing with an old woman with
softening of the brain."</p>

<p>"You are only possuming, Jack. Can you tell me honestly that
you're not putting the screw on old Larry, and letting Jane Dice
know that you could put the screw on there too if you liked?"</p>

<p>"Go to hell and mind your own business," said SP-over-J with the
snap of a dingo trap.</p>

<p>"Sorry to have put you out, Jack. It is none of my business of
course, only I hope you will be able to keep your noddle later if
things don't turn out exactly paradise. Chickens have a way of
going home to roost. It is sometimes better to squabash things in
the egg stage."</p>

<p>"Keep your advice for yourself. You may want it."</p>

<p>"I may. Well, old man, it's not worth quarrelling about. I'll
say no more."</p>

<p>SP-over-J recovering himself said, "If you're anxious for a job
in the affair, why don't you come and lend me a hand as best man at
the wedding?"</p>

<p>"I should be glad to under different circumstances."</p>

<p>"What's the matter&mdash;jealous?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am. If you could assure me that the girl is willing
I'd gladly stand up with you." With that they called it a day.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Poole, nevertheless, was not at all satisfied that Stanton was
not putting the screw on. Ronald's tale could not all be the result
of overheated imagination. The coming marriage was the scandal of
Monaro as well as Bool Bool. Miss Jessie M'Eachern asked her old
friend for the facts, as he believed them, next time he rode over.
Miss M'Eachern was famous in those days as the first native
spinster of the districts, and earned further notoriety by reigning
alone on Gowandale, the original pioneer holding, and making of it
one of the most thriftily managed properties in the Southern
District. She was a spry dame in the early fifties and by her
ability as a grazier and her disregard of the conventions was
accounted eccentric.</p>

<p>Only Miss M'Eachern knew why she was not Mrs Herbert Poole. It
was a long-standing puzzle to Poole upon which he cogitated even
now. Her name had been unfailingly coupled with his in their young
days and there were still some who betted that they would end their
days as man and wife.</p>

<p>"What is going to happen?" she inquired of the Stanton-Dice
Healey entanglement.</p>

<p>"The wedding is coining off after the New Year unless some
miracle intervenes."</p>

<p>"Why don't the young people elope and have done with it? They
could get a berth as man and wife.</p>

<p>"Aileen is no match for her family, and Dice's folks have the
whip-end of him too. SP-over-J is capable of foreclosing on both
places if he doesn't get his way, and Larry has shut the girl up
and beaten her, unless the talk is all lies."</p>

<p>"Most talk is. The girl is over twenty-one. She can do what she
likes."</p>

<p>"But you don't know old Larry's methods."</p>

<p>"I think I can estimate them. You must remember he tried to
marry half a dozen of us before poor Sissy Gilbert was simple
enough to take him, so he must have shown some of his
qualities."</p>

<p>"But you didn't accept any of us, Jessie. You refused Hugh
Mazere after being engaged to him for months, and you refused me
twice. Did you put me in the same box as Larry?"</p>

<p>"Surely you heard the common talk of why I broke with Hugh. It
was nearly as noisy as the clash about Aileen and young Dice
today."</p>

<p>"Well, the talk was, the talk was..."</p>

<p>"Why do you hesitate?"</p>

<p>"Well, they used to chaff me, and when I was fool enough to
believe I had a chance I found you were only pulling my leg, so you
see how far from the hull's-eye talk can he. Now that I've the
pluck to tell you the truth, why don't you tell me why you gave me,
as well as Larry, a slice of turnip?"</p>

<p>"Well, the first time, I could see you didn't want me very much.
If you had wanted me a little more, I should have taken you
then."</p>

<p>"By Jove, Jessie M'Eachern, do you mean that I have missed all
these years just because I was awkward! I've never been much at
laying on the soft soap."</p>

<p>Miss M'Eachern rose and went clown the narrow old drawing-room
where they had danced together long ago, and where the bullet hole
put in the wall by the bushrangers to warn the men was plainly
visible. She stepped out on the veranda where the roses still
clung&mdash;yellow, white, pink, and deepest purple-redwhere she
had taken him one Leap Year night to exercise her prerogative and
had met humiliation. In the height of summer glory the perfume of
the roses filled the hot afternoon. A zephyr from Cootapatamba
softly swept the grasses, girth-high in the homestead enclosures,
and rippled the tussocks on the undulating plains towards
Curradoobidgee. Poole rose too and stood with her on the edge of
the old veranda where he remembered sitting with her one night
under the stars while the dancers whirled past the windows to the
skirl of old Bab M'Intosh's bagpipes.</p>

<p>Rab, the Eueurunda shepherd, had gone with Mrs Labosseer over
the ranges but had always pined for Monaro and had come back
there&mdash;to the M'Eacherns&mdash;to die. He had requested to be
buried near his old hut, but it had been in inimical ownership at
that date so the good M'Eacherns had compromised by putting him on
a dainty ridge at the side of the orchard with a fine view of the
sweeping plains where mile upon mile of gowans waved in summer
beauty, and to which he had transferred his Scottish affections.
The ripening grasses were high on the mound with its carved wooden
head-board; the palings grey with years of blazing sun and whipping
winter sleet and winds. The old man had been wont to muse that the
long-legged black callant from Curradoobidgee was seeking Miss
Jessie for the other side of his hearth against the time that
Stepmother Poole should he gone to the land of the leal. But old
Mrs Poole was still very much mistress of the Curradoobidgee
fireside and Miss Jessie and the long-legged callant&mdash;still a
bachelor&mdash;were talking on the exact spot where they had talked
a generation past.</p>

<p>The old shepherd with all his second sight could never puzzle
out what had gone wrong between them. Neither could Poole, and he
was still curious. That was a braw run stretching round for miles,
and in spite of the parching season, provided plenty of picking for
the dots representing plentiful flocks and herds, mud fat. All
these years those miles might have marched with his portion of
Curradoobidgee, but he had missed through being a little too slow.
He could hardly accept that.</p>

<p>He looked at Jessie critically. She seemed unnecessarily
shrivelled. She had lost some of her teeth and her longish nose was
too near her chin: he had not remembered her eyes being so small in
the old days, and she had a tendency to whiskers, but Gowandale was
a beautiful property. Nearly all the original run was Jessie's now.
She had retained it intact by paying off the family shares year
after year.</p>

<p>Yes, Gowandale was a beautiful property and Jessie a smart
business woman.</p>

<p>"Jessie, you say I failed the first time because I didn't seem
to care enough. I suppose I was just as stupid the second time in
expressing what I felt, but surely the fact that I came up to
scratch a second time was evidence that I cared all right. What was
wrong with me the second time?"</p>

<p>"There was nothing wrong with you, laddie; it was simply that
you didn't care for me, and I could see it."</p>

<p>"You saw wrong, Jessie. What made you think I didn't care?"</p>

<p>"You only came asking me because Rachel Labosseer said no."</p>

<p>"What made you think I had asked her?"</p>

<p>"I knew by a word here and there while you were putting the
matter before me."</p>

<p>Poole reflected that women were the devil to find things out.
Keep the mouth shut tight, yet from a grunt or an ahem they would
know everything.</p>

<p>"I don't see why you would have nothing to do with me because of
that. I told you honestly about poor Emily Mazere."</p>

<p>"I didn't mind about Emily, but you only came to me because Mrs
Labosseer wouldn't have you."</p>

<p>"That doesn't hold water. There must have been something up with
me as none of you would have me, only poor Emily. Perhaps I'm as
bad as Larry Healey, and Emily had a lucky escape to be
drowned."</p>

<p>"Now you are havering, laddie." He did not know how near to sobs
was the little old-looking woman, her withered face as brown as
leather by half a century's suns. It was a slap to his vanity to
learn that he had made such a hash of proposals, he, supposedly
such a killer among the girls in his heyday. He had not done as
well as the obnoxious Larry, who had a second wife and might have a
third the way things were going.</p>

<p>"Well, Jessie, it's not too late yet, and you can't accuse me of
caring for anyone else now. My record for the last thirty years
ought to convince you. We are very good friends and could keep each
other from being lonely old willies in our last days."</p>

<p>She was silent. He was apprehensive, but the plains were more
than beautiful to him. There was a long stretch ahead of him yet,
unless he broke his neck or a tree fell on him. It would still take
a good horse to get rid of him, only he had long since learnt
better horse-taming methods than to submit his osseous parts to
unwarrantable strain. Good old Ma could not last much longer. Even
now she was a bit off, though her presence made the retention of
younger women as maids or visitors convenable. When she was gone he
would be in a fix. A man, if he had not a mother or sister, needed
a wife. Old Jack had a sister, but was not satisfied. It was not a
housekeeper however that old Jack was after, but that fever that
had seized them all years ago. He suppressed a smile to realize how
far it was from that towards Jessie; but those plains were
wonderful and Jessie had made them pay like hell.</p>

<p>"It's not too late yet," he reiterated. "We've wasted a lot of
time. There is no sense in wasting any more..."</p>

<p>By a gesture she stopped him. Her weatherbeaten features did not
convey her suppressed emotion. "Yes, it is too late, Bert," she
said in a low voice. "Just about twenty or thirty years too late.
I'm too set in my ways now. I could never settle down to domestic
work completely. The station and the stock and buying and selling
are my life now." She was the acutest person on Monaro in a horse
or cattle deal, and even made money out of fowls and pigs and
fruit.</p>

<p>"You needn't give that up, Jessie," he said, relieved by her
refusal. She did look old, and no bridal figure. She saw his relief
and it hurt again as of yore. He had always been relieved by her
refusals, and pride now, as in days gone by, stood between her and
a union of calm friendship.</p>

<p>"Well, then, Jessie," he said with his old winning smile, now
ambushed by the squatter's beard, well kept, with very little grey
amid the black. "As you won't have me at any price, young or old,
and we have both for one reason or another got nothing from the
marriage basket, what do you say to helping along the love affair
of the young people who don't seem able to pull themselves out of
the lickhole?"</p>

<p>"Have you a plan?"</p>

<p>"I thought if you were ripe for another investment you might do
something to turn the screws off Dice or old Larry. That part must
increase in value as relief stations as the country gets stocked
up."</p>

<p>Jessie M'Eachern was happy accumulating and then investing. She
asked searching and technical questions that only the bank or
lawyer could answer.</p>

<p>"I have put myself into a corner with both old Larry and Jack
and can say no more, but you were always kind to the Healeys and
might begin afresh and see if you have any influence."</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>The gossip of the hotel verandas was that old Jess M'Eachern of
Gowandale was in Bool Bool on a special visit of respect to
Great-grandma Mazere because she had been unable to attend the
bridge opening owing to wool-washing and shearing. She had ridden
clown with one of her nephews and stayed the night with Alf Timson
at Billy-go-Billy on a Friday. During Saturday morning she pointed
out how the place could be made to pay twice as well as it did, Alf
with meek stubbornness seeming to agree, then he saddled-up and
arrived with her at Neangen about sundown.</p>

<p>The three were made welcome and Miss Jessie devoted particular
attention to Aileen on the strength of the girl's recent visit to
Monaro and a night she had spent at Gowandale. Aileen was looking
wonderful. The brilliance of excitement enhanced her delicate
beauty. Miss Jessie kept her talking in her room whither Aileen had
been the one to pilot her.</p>

<p>"So, Aily lass," she said. "You're going to be married soon
after the New Year, I understand."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Jessie," said Aileen with no self-conscious radiance
of a bride, but a startled furtive air.</p>

<p>"Now, what would ye like me to gie ye as a present?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Jessie. You are too kind." There was an absence
of normal enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Well, well! Here's every lassie in the world going to be
married but mysel'. I'm the only lonely one. Can ye tell me the
rights o' that?"</p>

<p>"They all say, Miss Jessie, that when you were a girl you had
ever so many more beaux than any girl has now; didn't you like any
of them?" said Aily, always kindly.</p>

<p>"But, lassie, love's a game in which there must be two to do the
likin' and lovin', and baith must be awfu' sure, or it's a bad
estate. Are you sure now that you love with all your heart that
auld man, auld enough to be your grandfather almost; is there not
some nice young laddie ridin' aboot the country keekin' at your
bonny wee face? Ah, but lassie, it's good to be young and bonny and
have some braw young laddie worshippin' the ground you walk on. It
wouldn't matter gin you had your hand in his, if you had only the
stars above you for roof and the bracken for a pillow, that would
be heaven, and everything else would come."</p>

<p>"That's what I think too," said the girl, and halted upon
realizing her admission.</p>

<p>"Then, lassie, why not hold fast to the right and let the Lord
take care of the rest. You don't know who may be on your side."</p>

<p>"Oh, but it's not myself, Miss Jessie. I have to think
of&mdash;" Aileen halted apprehensively. She detected movement in
the room adjoining. The wall was of slabs and some of the wide
cracks were closed only with strips of unbleached calico, papered
over. Every whisper could be heard by an ear on the other side.
Aileen began to do something unnecessary for Miss Jessie. She was
obviously terrified of being overheard.</p>

<p>"Well," said Miss Jessie in a low murmur, making a noise to
cover it, "only be sure, lassie, that you love your
laddie&mdash;anything else is wicked and will bring no happiness
because it can have no blessing."</p>

<p>They were not permitted to be alone together during the
remainder of the evening, so Miss M'Eachern forsook romance and
talked business with her host. She let Larry gather that she was
seeking investments as well as paying a state cal! on old Mrs
Mazere.</p>

<p>"By cripes, old Jessie is a real jew&mdash;she'd make a bargain
of her grandmother's grave. She must he bursting with
spondulics&mdash;chance for you, Alf, riding about with you and
staying the night with you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she'd no more think of takin' me than she did you when
you asked her," drawled Alf. Larry scrutinized his visitor's
profile against the night where they were smoking a final pipe on
the veranda, but could not detect intentional malice.</p>

<p>"Remember what I tell you, lassie," said Miss Jessie as she
kissed Aileen in departing on Sunday afternoon to spend the night
at Bookaledgeree.</p>

<p>She progressed in the high and brilliant sun, the air
irradiating like an electric river along the track, which to
practised eyes showed that many a wallaby brush, lyre-bird, goanna,
or snake had written the tale of its passage in the soft grey
dust.</p>

<p>"Poor country and full of dingoes," remarked Miss Jessie to her
nephew. "It's a stand-by in droughts. Otherwise it would take a
terrible-sized run to make a living, and too many horses and men to
boundary-ride."</p>

<p>All was delightful amid the great trees but for the stench of
the dead cattle&mdash;Tommy Roper's mob&mdash;that marked the Route
like milestones as they had succumbed to thirst and starvation on
the way to the land of refuge from the drought-smitten western
slopes. Boundary-riders had taken advantage of the carcasses, and
in the area from which the brands had been cut had deposited
staggering doses of strychnine. All dogs went tightly muzzled.</p>

<p>Miss Jessie reprimanded her corpulent old mare for shying at a
bovine corpse, and broke into a canter on a level stretch above the
river that she remembered from the days of her youth, when the
world had had a different complexion. It recalled to her that she
had had to wrestle with a situation more difficult than Aileen's.
Loving Poole deathlessly without response, she had weakly given in
to Hugh Mazere, and then, after the engagement had held for months
with satisfaction to both families, had had to find courage to
break it. Aileen needed a similar spirit and her problem would soon
be solved, Miss Jessie reflected as she rode along over thirty
years later among the tormenting flies and the palpitant drumming
of cicadas, and, reaching the valley of the Bookaledgeree, turned
into the Dice homestead.</p>

<p>The Dice family had come to Bookaledgeree fifteen years before,
and the only members of it to whom Miss M'Eachern was known
personally were Ronald and Matt, but this did not detract from her
welcome. She spoke of riding on later to Three Rivers, but Mrs Dice
said, "It would never do to let Aunt Rachel Mazere see you
desecrating the Sabbath by unnecessary travel." So Miss Jessie
consented to stay the night.</p>

<p>Ronald took her to look at the yearlings in a paddock below the
orchard, and there they set to the topic of the hour.</p>

<p>"I'm surprised to hear you have let old Jack Stanton take little
Aily Healey away from you, laddie. When I saw you at Gowandale a
few weeks ago I thought..."</p>

<p>"Well, you see, Miss Jessie, he has a wagon-load of money-bags
and all I have is a double mortgage on my mother's property, and
old SP-over-J has got in here too."</p>

<p>"But laddie, you're strong and young and handsome and have your
intellect; the world's big financial men often started from
less."</p>

<p>"It's not me, Miss Jessie, it's poor little Aileen."</p>

<p>"She's a grown woman of legal age&mdash;it may sound bitter to
say so and too bad to bear at the time&mdash;I've been young and in
love, so believe me, laddie, I know&mdash;but a lassie who does not
think more of love than the bawbees is not worth greeting for." As
she got on in years Miss Jessie forsook the locutions of her
governesses for her parents' vocabulary.</p>

<p>"Little Aily doesn't care for the bawbees, Miss Jessie. Old
Larry shuts her up and wallops her. He shot my best horse dead
under me, so you see it's more of a siege than you think. My family
too are against Aily, and dying to get her away from me by marrying
the old Death Adder, so I couldn't bring her here."</p>

<p>"I'll give you a job for a beginning on Gowandale. I'm losing my
brother Bruce's boy at Christmas. I'll want an overseer, and you
know the work. I could put you in the old wing where my brothers
used to sleep&mdash;one room could be turned into a kitchen."</p>

<p>"Miss Jessie! Do you mean it! Is this a fair and square
offer?"</p>

<p>"It is the offer of a sentimental old maid who wants to help
young love, and it is good business too for both of us. Your
brother Matt is old enough to take on the management here."</p>

<p>"When does that offer start?"</p>

<p>"From the day you set foot on Gowandale, and I'll give you a
month's wages for your honeymoon&mdash;that means I'll hold the
place for you till the beginning of February."</p>

<p>Ronald threw his hat in the air and was about to whirl Miss
Jessie in his arms when interrupted by other members of the family
announcing the evening meal. He whispered, "I'm off up after tea to
try to see Aily, and you won't start for Bool Bool in the morning
till I can tell you my luck."</p>

<p>Miss Jessie laughed. "That's right laddie, a man that isn't
enthusiastic about his love affairs is only half a man. Give Aily
my love and tell her to he brave."</p>

<p>"Ronnie seems in a terrible hurry all of a sudden," observed
Ida, as her brother vaulted the orchard fence of stout split rails
and disappeared.</p>

<p>"A young man is generally in a hurry except to say good night to
his dawtie."</p>

<p>"Ronald doesn't get any chance of seeing his lassie these days.
I suppose you heard about his infatuation for Aileen Healey?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She's a bonny wee thing."</p>

<p>"She's pretty in a way, but there's not much in her. We'll all
he glad when SP-over-J marries her and takes her away to Turrill
Turrill so that Ronald can forget her."</p>

<p>"There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip in love affairs.
Ronald may..."</p>

<p>"Oh, but Miss Jessie, we don't want him to. We wish he would
marry someone nicer."</p>

<p>Miss Jessie diverted attention to acreage and briars and clips
and staples and drought, and her hosts said she talked just like a
man and did not care for anything but business and money.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the lover sped along the way Miss Jessie had come. He
could not risk another horse; besides, a bullet that could drop his
horse under him was a cogent warning, so he tethered Spondulix's
successor about half a mile from the house and approached on foot.
The Neangen dogs were notably efficient, and a man on foot an
object to arouse suspicion in dogs of whatever standing. They made
a great racket but none was off chain, thanks to the liberal
bait-laying, and Ronald put them off his purpose by fully passing
the house and featly returning. He had a juicy bait prepared for
the fat old bitch who always lay about the house because she was of
a famous line of children's guardians. No lights showed in the
windows and Ronald arrived safely outside Aileen's skillion. He
knew this was shared by the gimlet-eyed Julie, but he rested on her
being of an age to sleep like a lost opportunity. Here he found the
old nurse dog chained but he was a favourite with her and by
fondling cut short her welcoming yelp and withheld the bait. The
window was closed, so he stood back in the shadows and waited. Soon
a snore or two through the flimsy walls announced that some of the
four females were asleep. Some were not accounted for. Awful should
Aileen be among the snorers and those awake, the enemy! There was a
wide crack in Aileen's wall beside her bed with a piece of tin
tacked over. A stout penknife soon made an opening. Ronald paused
again. The moon was high enough above the feathery peaks of the
ranges to illuminate the little room. With the aid of a switch he
could have placed his missive on Aileen's chest, but fearing it
might come first to Julie's eye, he called softly "Aily! Aily! It
is Ronnie."</p>

<p>She sat up as from a dream. "It's Ronnie. Be careful." He was
now encouraged by Julie's whole-hearted and vocal slumber.</p>

<p>"Where are you? Are you hurt?"</p>

<p>"No. Don't move or say a word. Here is a letter." The girl
clasped his fingers through the aperture and rained kisses upon
them till a movement in the night startled them. They halted
petrified for a moment, but it was not an inmate.</p>

<p>"Good night, darling!" he whispered presently. "Read your
letter. Nail up this crack in the morning."</p>

<p>She listened, breathless while he moved away softly. A
willywagtail chirped, "Sweet pretty creature! Sweet pretty
creature!" Old Bessy gave a sleepy yelp and some thuds as she
disturbed the tormenting fleas. A mopoke called. A plover clicked
by the creek. All was quiet.</p>

<p>Aileen quietly applied a match to the candle and read of Miss
M'Eachern's offer and the instructions for placing her reply in a
mortice hole in an old post down where the road wound round the
spur.</p>

<blockquote>Meet me, darling, some night. Send me word what night
and where I shall meet you. I shall have a couple of horses waiting
and we can ride straight through to Gowandale without stopping.
Miss Mac will take care of you and stick to us about getting
married, and we'll have a good home right from scratch. Be brave,
my own love, and we soon shall be all in all to each other. I'll
ride up every night for your answer.</blockquote>

<p>Here was deliverance! If Ronald had reached the house in spite
of the watch-dogs it would be much easier for her to get away from
it. Her family followed no way of life nor mind to breed insomnia.
The weight of the mortgages might have kept old Larry awake but he
had found a royal road away from them. Aileen's silly clamour about
Dice never gave him a qualm, and so long as Pa was not venting his
undisciplined disposition directly upon her, Mrs Healeys somnolent
soul found ready unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Aileen lay awake thinking over her reply to that wonderful
letter and how she could privily deposit it in the old post. In the
morning it seemed less easy than during the night.</p>

<p>Ronald reported his progress to Miss M'Eachern before she left
next morning. "You want to be sure that you love each other better
than anything else in the world and then go ahead," she said.
"You've only to tap on my window some night and I'll take the
lassie in till we can all away to the minister."</p>

<p>A few days later she detailed her offer to her friend of
Curradoobidgee, who had ridden over to spend Saturday night and
hear the news.</p>

<p>"I could see that the girl is being forced to marry Stanton
against her heart, but there is little that outsiders can do by
meddling if the main parties can't settle their own affairs.</p>

<p>"Talk about doing nothing, Jessie, you have pulled the whole
thing out of the fire. We have only to wait the next move.</p>

<p>"We'll see! We'll see! If the girl hasn't the strength of will
to help herself now, she must take the consequences. These are not
old clays when girls can be locked in a keep. She could slip out
any night and take a horse and away to her laddie."</p>

<p>"But poor little Aily, she's such a gentle little creature.
She's like a bird in a net."</p>

<p>"That sort of woman can often work a great deal of sorrow for
herself and others by her lack of stamina," persisted Miss Jessie,
in what Poole thought an unsympathetic tone. Miss Jessie was
thinking of days gone by and the courage she had needed both one
Leap Year night and later to free herself from a big mistake.</p>

<p>On Monday night Ronald rode to the old post, but there was no
message in it. On the second night he retired ostentatiously and
when Matt was snoring crept to the stable for his horse and rode
quietly away in the moonlight. The third day he had to go for
cattle up Bookaledgeree Creek, and by a bit of stiff riding
included his pilgrimage in the day's work. The next day he packed
salt in the same direction and again made the detour. The fifth day
he rested his horse and worked near the homestead. On Saturday
night he took French leave of Matt's horse, and on
Sunday&mdash;playday&mdash;being free of his time, in the afternoon
he rode towards Bool Bool and when safe doubled on his tracks and
once more sought a message.</p>

<p>He went in broad daylight, but could find no trace of anyone but
himself in the bracken at the base of the post. A beautiful bush of
"old man" almost hid it and the aromatic putty-grey flowers and
viscid leaves rested without a disarranged twig. There was no shred
of paper anywhere.</p>

<p>Each day, on finding no message, Ronald gre more disappointed,
but hoped valiantly. It would be awkward for Aileen to escape the
vigilance of her family, and she was not of the mould to slip out
in the night and go so far alone. He wished he had asked her to
ride away to Bookaledgeree without a message and then he could have
taken her with him to Gowandale. He was worried lest he should miss
a message about an appointed tryst.</p>

<p>He was correct about the difficulties besetting Aileen. She got
away near the end of the week on the pretext of special broom-stuff
that grew near the spur. Julie was detailed to accompany her, but
Aileen galloped ahead while Julie was wrestling with her old neddy,
and so reached the post with time to spare.</p>

<p>She left Miss Muffet on the road and went on foot. As she was
about to insert her missive in the deep mortice hole she caught the
glitter of a black snake coiled in the recess. It almost brushed
her face in making its exit and was joined by a second. They
disappeared in a hole at the base of the post. Aileen with a scream
of terror fled to her horse and was riding along the road by the
time Julie overtook her. Aileen had the abnormal terror of
poisonous snakes inculcated in bush children. She was too
frightened to approach the horrible spot again. The prospect of
marriage with SP-over-J grew less repellent by comparison. Larry's
ceaseless exordiums about the duty she bore her mother and sisters
were working, and, imbued with the superstitions of her forebears,
and nervously overwrought, she took this as a powerful omen against
what she contemplated. The whole family were unfeelingly against
her, even Norah was not so kind as usual. No luck could ever attend
her, Larry maintained, if she forsook the saving of her family and
for her own selfish pleasure allied herself with thriftlessness.
This the burden of every aspersion day after day.</p>

<p>She had prayed to God for guidance by some sign or happening,
and to her fear-burdened soul the deadly black snakes were the
response. She longed wildly to meet Ronald somewhere and tell him
this mental and spiritual angle of her ordeal, but this wish
remained unanswered. There were only the serpents, which multiplied
in her dreams. She was continually springing from bed tormented by
a nightmare in which she was pursued by reptiles, and there was no
one to help the distraught little soul.</p>

<p>It seemed at length to her fevered imagination that the way to
absolution was by sacrificing herself for her family's good.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p>Gossip received fresh life from the invitations. It was to be a
full-sized wedding. People said that SP-over-J must be paying for
everything, and grinned to think that whatever the rights of the
romance, old Larry was selling dear.</p>

<p>"There ain't no flies on old Larry!" commented Tommy Roper.</p>

<p>Aileen pleaded for a quiet wedding from her Aunt Denny's in
Sydney, but Stanton was not to be fobbed off like that. The
hardness and cruelty in him, the outcome of sensibilities perished
in youth, demanded full triumph. His own set and circle,
subscribing to the legend that his early love preferred a nunnery
to him, should publicly witness his success with the prettiest girl
of the district.</p>

<p>Some still pitied the girl, but these were mostly young and
sentimental and of no business promise. Now that the wedding was
announced general opinion was that the girl had done "thundering
well for herself". "When she gets past the first fever of
spooniness," said Ida Dice, "she will be very glad to find herself
in the lap of luxury instead of in a stringybark bed in some
boundary-rider's hut."</p>

<p>Everyone of any standing, and many without, known either to the
bride or bridegroom's family, was invited. Miss M'Eachern of
Gowandale was one of the few who refused. She could not be absent
from home so soon again. She wrote to Dice to know the rights of
the case. He replied with bitter words about Aileen. The cynicism
of his associates had tarnished his faith in her.</p>

<p>"All this fuss about old Larry and Stanton is ridiculous," said
Ida. "If Aileen had wanted you she could easily escape. I think
myself she is a weak-minded, selfish creature. She would have liked
you best if you had money. Any girl would prefer a young man to an
old scrag if things were equal; but she hasn't got the courage to
take you without anything."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed his sister Olive, "and if she felt one-tenth what
you imagine about marrying old Stanton she would not want all this
big wedding waved in your face."</p>

<p>"That isn't Aileen's wish, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"I don't know: she is very fond of pretty clothes. Old Larry
wouldn't risk a rumpus or breakdown if they were marrying her by
force, neither would old Jack. The show wedding must be to please
Aileen because she is a young girl and wants it. Old Jack wouldn't
spend an extra penny if only he was concerned; he's never for
society fuss and feathers."</p>

<p>Ronald saw that he would make a fool of himself to lie down
under his defeat. He took it recklessly with more drinks than he
should have had, with everyone and anyone, from Tommy Roper to Mr
Eustace Blenkinsop, to whom he muttered misanthropic platitudes
about women.</p>

<p>The Dices received a full and formal invitation. This smote
Ronald as brazen insolence, which he did not know whether to
attribute to SP-over-J or old Larry. His sisters asserted that it
showed Aileen was not so unwilling as her weak amiability led him
to suppose.</p>

<p>"You go," advised Ida, "and show that you don't care any more
than she does; plenty better girls than she is, ready to go with
you."</p>

<p>"I'll march right up to the altar and denounce old Skinny Guts.
When they ask about the impediment I'll say that any fool could see
he was one, and that they locked the girl up and walloped her and
shot my horse under me; and she can speak the truth then."</p>

<p>"If you think she would have the pluck to stick to you then, you
would make an unholy fool of yourself," said Ida.</p>

<p>"Yes, she'd faint or cry, and you'd be looked upon as a brute,
and then she'd be hustled away and married quietly out of
sight."</p>

<p>"I'll give her the chance anyhow, and then I shan't have
anything to be sorry for afterwards."</p>

<p>"You'd have a great deal more to be sorry for if you made a fool
of yourself like that."</p>

<p>The wedding was to be in the new church of St Matthew, but
lately dedicated by the bishop. It was largely due to old Mrs
Mazere that the church had gone ahead so vigorously in the
district. The new structure was to have a spire in memory of Philip
and Rachel Mazere, for which purpose the original Philip had
apportioned &pound;300 in the famous will, which he had changed
every time a family member crossed him. The early church of the
sixties, now known as the Church Hall, was to contain the wedding
breakfast, and M'Haffety's Hotel and Isaacs's Royal Drapery Mart
between them were the providers. Mrs Isaacs was enchanted to be
where the news was made, and gave personal attention to the bunting
and such dry eatables as the mart could supply, while the M'Haffety
end of the outbreak was effulgent as effulgence was in the
surroundings.</p>

<p>Each fresh detail was more exciting than the last.</p>

<p>"I hear that Milly Saunders is to be bridesmaid with Julie,"
remarked Rebecca to Norah.</p>

<p>"Is that so? Sure, then, Lucy Saunders must have given in."</p>

<p>"There's more than that: Bert Poole is to be best man,"</p>

<p>"Who would believe that, whin I heard he did iverything he could
to call ould Stanton off. Sure, if he comes round, it shows that
the gurrul Aileen must he quite happy to marry, and all this fuss
of Ronald Dice's, phwat do ye make of that?"</p>

<p>"Aw, young men in love can make an awful noise one week and
forget all about it the next. They say he drinks more than he ought
now, and that would account for his capers."</p>

<p>"But sure, he might have been dhruv to it by
disappointment."</p>

<p>"My opinion is that people aren't drove to things unless they
have a mind that way."</p>

<p>"That's thrue, too, Rebecca. At anny rate, ould Jack will he
glad to have Poole standin' up with him. They went coortin'
together often enough long ago. I wonder now who will Poole be
takin'? He might be the next."</p>

<p>"I hear that Ronald is going to denounce old Stanton in
church."</p>

<p>"Och, that would be pot-valiant. Whisky talks like that."</p>

<p>"I expect old Larry and old Jack will be glad when it's safely
over."</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>The day arrived. It was a droughty summer even for Bool Bool,
that valley of the blest. The Yarrabongo had never been so low in
the memory of the generation in possession. The dust was deep on
every road and lane, upon every roof and ornamental tree that stood
by the wayside. The January Wednesday dawned in brazen splendour.
By nine o'clock the hydrangea bushes and pumpkin vines were
drooping in the heat and the fowls had their wings spread for air
in the shade of the drays and blacksmiths' sheds. People converged
upon the church from every side. Buggy-load after buggy-load of
women in voluminous silk dust-coats and almost opaque gossamers
were escorted by men also in dust-coats and with fly-veils on their
panama hats. Not only the church and vicarage grounds, but lanes
adjoining, were peopled by harness horses stamping and switching
against the tormenting flies. The early arrivals eagerly watched
the appearance of certain persons and families. It was not only the
largest but the most exciting wedding the new edifice had
known.</p>

<p>"There's Lucy Saunders. She hates it like poison, too, but we
all had to come round," whispered Mrs Ned Saunders.</p>

<p>"There are the Labosseers!"</p>

<p>The widow and Emily, two of the sons and a married daughter
followed the lady of Coolooluk to a pew. Anything she did created
interest in the little town where the family had high standing.</p>

<p>"I didn't think she'd come, did you? I'm sure she doesn't think
the Healeys much chop," said Rebecca.</p>

<p>"No, but they are all rolling up to stick to ould SP-over-J.
Sure, they're as clannish as cockatoos.</p>

<p>"Dot Saunders can have Ron Dice now that Aileen will be salted
down. Not much of a match for her, but she has eyes for no one
else."</p>

<p>"There's herself! Sure, I didn't think she would come. I heard
the ould lady told SP-over-J..." This was swamped by a more
interesting murmur.</p>

<p>"The Dices!"</p>

<p>"As large as life! Don't look round."</p>

<p>All eyes turned upon these arrivals. Being near town, they had
their regular pew. Mrs Dice leant on the arm of her eldest son, who
was walking straight and defiant, handsome and young in a smart new
suit. He settled the others and took the end seat on the aisle. The
bridegroom appeared shortly afterwards accompanied by Poole.
Stanton was expensively tailored but looked nervous and tired.
Poole looked splendid and unruffled.</p>

<p>"Do you think Ronnie will really make a howl?" whispered Marcia
Mazere to her cousin, Dot Saunders, in the choir. Dot hardly knew
one air from another, but it was the correct thing for the young
women of the clans to sing in the choir of St Matthew's. "No!
That's all nonsense. He found out long ago that Aileen didn't
really want him. Look at Bert Poole standing up there with Uncle
Jack; he wouldn't be there if it wasn't all ship-shape."</p>

<p>The church was profusely decorated and the flowers were wilting
in the heat. The scent of roses and honeysuckle and a dozen other
perfumes intermingled, and the air was made heavier by orange
blossom from the shelter of the broad chimneys at Three Rivers.</p>

<p>Stanton took one glance round the congregation to find Dice
glaring balefully at him, and did not dare look up again. The
assemblage fell throbbingly quiet awaiting the bride. Dozens of
young women in elaborate summer gowns with bustles and panniers and
flounces almost held their breath with excitement. In the charged
and drowsy air the song of the Yarrabongo as it fell over a cliff
beyond the Glebe filled all the day with the suggestion of cool
sweet peace.</p>

<p>The bridegroom suffered an agony of nerves. The quiet following
his entry grew into restlessness again. People fidgeted and
whispered and turned their heads to look for the bride.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she's not coining at all," whispered Marcia to Dot.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly. Her mother is here."</p>

<p>"Won't it be awful if Ronnie makes a fuss?" persisted
Marcia.</p>

<p>"He won't do any such thing. He wasn't as much in love as all
that."</p>

<p>People could no longer surmise that Aileen had eloped with Dice,
as they had been predicting to within an hour of the ceremony, when
here he was for all to see, and though SP-over-J would not have
glanced towards him again for the price of the Corroboree and
Wamgambril colts combined, it was worth double that to know that
Ronald was inside the building. He had sent Poole to the hotel
early in the morning to ascertain that Aileen was well.</p>

<p>The ordeal of waiting wore away to relief. Mrs Arthur Rankin
(Fanny Mazere) started her organ. Welcome sound! Aileen had not
eloped; she had not fallen sick of brain fever; she had not even
fainted; she was only ten minutes late. She approached along the
aisle on her father's arm, a fairy apparition in intricate bridal
finery of satin duchesse or marchioness, or whatever it was called
in that decade, and tulle and lace and orange blossoms.</p>

<p>"The prettiest bride I ever did see," whispered Mrs Isaacs to
Mrs M'Haffety.</p>

<p>"Not as pretty as Rachel Mazere that was."</p>

<p>"She was darker and smaller."</p>

<p>"And she couldn't hould a candle to poor Emily that was
drownded."</p>

<p>"But we never saw Emily as a bride."</p>

<p>"She was just like a bride that night of her birthday ball."
Faithfulness to the past showed that Norah and Rebecca were growing
old. "Ah, look! Did ye see the look the poor pet cast on Ronnie
Dice, like a frightened angel!"</p>

<p>As Aileen came up the aisle Ronald turned of deliberation and
glared at her. She was clutching her father's arm gazing at her
feet, but as though mesmerized she lifted her head as she came near
Ronald. That look was salted away in sentimentality by Bool Bool,
and is a legend today with outsiders, when the principals have
forgotten the emotions from which it sprang. There are old folks
thereaway, when the cynical say there is no true love to contend
that they saw it naked in the eyes of Aileen Healey that sweltering
day, and matched in the eyes of Ronald Dice, careless of onlookers;
but people imagine what pleases them of amorous romance,
unconvinced by evidence that sexual love per se is a transient
emotion.</p>

<p>As that may be. Aileen's foot in its white satin slipper tripped
in the coconut matting, but the alert Larry lifted her safely
along. She was closely followed by her two half-sisters as
bridesmaids, who closed up the space behind her, and next came
Milly and Julie, Milly delicious in self-importance, with the whole
weight of the ceremony as a public concern on her shoulders, and a
model faithfully copied by Julie. It was Stanton who paid for the
elaborate costumes of the two little girls and the bracelets they
wore with orgulous air becoming the Garter.</p>

<p>It was no light thing for Milly to be upholding her uncle as
bridesmaid. Her sympathies at first were with Ronald, but such
aspersions as Death Adder and Skinny had put her on her relative's
side. By insisting that Aileen resembled the beautiful Miss Severn,
later the Marchioness of Salterton, Mr Blenkinsop had made her a
figure of romance to Milly, whereas Ronald had failed in not
carrying off the lady by force, and when her Uncle Bert was tabled
as best man, Milly was eager to be a bridesmaid.</p>

<p>SP-over-J was immensely encouraged by the child's support and
became so indulgent that her mother was unable to enforce
discipline. Lucy Saunders had strenuously objected to Milly's
taking part, but when she found the tide against her, adopted a
more neutral manner. The Stantons were clannish, and if Aileen
could not he kept out of the family she should be accepted and made
the best of. Poole being best man further reconciled the widow to
Milly's participation.</p>

<p>Mrs Dice put her hand on her son's arm as old Healey lifted his
daughter along. That gesture also became history.</p>

<p>"Aily is like Cinderella and the ugly sisters," whispered Mrs
Raymond Poole (Rhoda Mazere).</p>

<p>The bride and her father reached the altar rail. The bridesmaids
fidgeted with their finery and flowers and jewellery'. A hush fell
upon the congregation. Inside, the flies buzzed in the perfumed
heat; outside, the cicadas' hirrient filled the heavens; horses
could be heard stamping in torment; a vehicle rumbled over the
bridge and clattered up the stony main street; a clog barked; the
song of the Yarrabongo floated in as cool and clear as a sigh from
paradise. Poole, observing the ethereal loveliness of the
bride&mdash;old Jack's young bride&mdash;was carried by that song
of the river back to the funeral of his own bride-to-be, nearly
thirty-two years gone. He remembered that river song for ever. All
this crowd and heat and perfume and undercurrent of strain brought
a sense of unreality, only the faint cool music of the river
remained.</p>

<blockquote>Dearly beloved, we are gathered together...<br>
<br>
First, it was ordained for the procreation of children...<br>
<br>
Secondly, it was ordained for a remedy against sin, and to avoid
fornication...</blockquote>

<p>The pronouncement was squeezed affectedly in the Oxford brogue
from the throat of the clergyman, and many, in the circumstances of
the old man and the young woman, reputedly unwilling, were shocked
by its grossness.</p>

<blockquote>Thirdly...Therefore, if any man can show any just cause
why, etc., etc., let him now speak, or else hereafter for ever hold
his peace.</blockquote>

<p>The clergyman paused. Tension tightened. Stanton felt beads of
perspiration coursing down his forehead and wilting his high stiff
collar. Aileen was not conscious of the service. Everyone looked at
Ronald Dice, but the mesmerism of the mob, more powerful than any
police force, had him in its grip.</p>

<p>Dot Saunders watched the drama spellbound from the choir. If one
could be loved, even hopelessly, by the right man, it would be
happier than not to be loved at all by him!</p>

<p>Tension relaxed. The clergyman was proceeding: I require and
charge you both, as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgment
when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed...</p>

<p>There being no impediment, the betrothal words were murmured and
then: <i>Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?</i></p>

<p>Larry's voice, confident and loud, rang out, "I do."</p>

<p>People almost smiled. It became a normal wedding, abnormal only
in size and showiness.</p>

<p>Soon all was chatter and laughter. There was a rush to
congratulate and kiss the bride and to strew roses in her pathway.
On the arm of her husband she looked more lovely than ever.
Excitement lent colour to her delicate cheeks and starriness to her
translucent Irish eyes. Aileen was not a thinker. Her own volition
was in abeyance: she moved in accordance with the plan forced upon
her, her overwrought emotions blurred.</p>

<p>Ronald was quite normal. There was nothing else he could be,
without making a sorry show of himself, and any normal young man
would rather cut himself off from heaven than make a fool of
himself before a crowd of his associates.</p>

<p>It fell out conveniently for him to offer his arm to Dot and
proceed to the wedding breakfast. That was altogether recovering
from foolishness as he was the envy of half a dozen eligibles who
pursued that popular beauty.</p>

<p>"Old Larry looks as pleased as a cat licking his whiskers after
a feed of Christmas turkey," he remarked, "and Uncle Skinny as if
he had been to the dentist and got it over; isn't it dead
funny?"</p>

<p>"Too funny for words," said Dot. "Aren't you coming over with me
to kiss my new aunt?" She was singularly deficient in a sense of
humour, but Ronald amused her.</p>

<p>"I'll leave the kissing to you. I'm afraid Uncle Death Adder
might kiss me by mistake."</p>

<p>He was in a gay and reckless mood. "Look at Ronald Dice," they
whispered. "He came to the wedding after all. He's with Dot
Saunders&mdash;a much better match for him.'</p>

<p>"All that talk about him and the bride must have been
yarns."</p>

<p>"Yes, you never can believe a word you hear."</p>

<p>Others, who said that they never took their eyes off him,
recorded that he did not speak to the bride or bridegroom nor to
any of the Healey family.</p>

<p>Stanton was so nervous that had old Larry palmed Norah or Joanna
off on him he could not have detected it until afterwards, but with
Aileen's hand on his arm, with all the clatter and joyous
excitement of the young people and the orthodox behaviour of their
elders, relief and gratification were his. He had not been fooled
by Aileen's non-appearance, as his strained imagination had feared,
and was glad now that he had insisted upon a show wedding.</p>

<p>Triumph and satisfaction were equally old Larry's. He had the
elation of the gambler when chance has favoured him, and was more
than genial. SP-over-J was almost genial too. Life had never been
better. Ghosts of the past were banished by this summer festival,
by this rebirth of passion in Indian summer.</p>

<p>The wedding breakfast burst. The bride and groom were in the
centre seats, the bride's parents conventionally placed. The
bridegroom's parents being in the cemetery, his sister Lucy and
other near relatives closed up the ranks to support him. Milly and
Julie were seated on either side of Poole, who accorded them the
deference due their exalted state. There were older bridesmaids as
well as lay maids and widows who would fain have had the little
girls' places.</p>

<p>The toasts were long and florid and in execrable taste in some
instances, and in others singularly short but adequate. The
bridegroom mumbled for the bride; the bride's father and the
clergyman did their duty; the field was thrown open. Mr Blenkinsop,
always a pattern and an ornament upon such occasions, repeated his
reference to the Marchioness of Salterton. Souls less felicitous
said it was to be hoped that others would now follow the example of
SP-over-J and take themselves off the shelf. Poole of
Curradoobidgee was broadly mentioned. He was unperturbed. He had
had thirty years of it.</p>

<p>Milly, feeling for him, whispered in his ear, "Uncle Bert, if
you feel embarrassed, you can mention that I'm waiting for you.
What do you think?"</p>

<p>Poole seriously and graciously whispered in reply, "Thank you,
Milly, that's fine. I'm counting on it. But perhaps we had better
not make ourselves conspicuous now, just a hint will save my
bacon." He had already officiated for the bridesmaids, he rose
again to respond to the toast of the bachelors and to explain why
he remained one. He was greeted by hearty applause and said little,
but he was sure of appreciation in that audience. He deplored that
he was not a favourite with the ladies except when they were too
young to marry, and liked him as an uncle. ( Laughter and cries of
denial.) He had now fixed his hopes on the grandniece class, and if
several young ladies he had promised to wait for did not all
disappoint him and run off with younger cavaliers, as several had
already done, he still lived in hopes! (Laughter.) SP-over-J and he
had been boys together. They had gone possuming many a night. ( A
voice: "Was that all you did?")</p>

<p>"Well, we may have ridden a buckjumper or two by daylight and
had a polka or two by night." (Hearty laughter.) "SP-over-J, I have
known so long that if he has any serious faults I have forgotten
them, and as for the bride, one of the loveliest I have seen in a
long and wide experience as an uncle, I've carried her on my
shoulder when she was not so tall as she is today, and now wish her
and her husband all luck and prosperity on behalf of the envious
bachelors. I call upon Mr Alistair Farquharson and some of the
others to respond on behalf of bachelors who are not so long in the
horn as myself."</p>

<p>Those who kept an eye on Dice said that never a toast did he
drink, but threw wine or champagne out of the window beside him. At
any rate, Dot Saunders, now that Aileen was out of the way, secured
him as a partner to ride at Gundagai and other agricultural
shows.</p>

<p>Everything went without a hitch. In the afternoon the bride and
groom left for Gundagai, thence to Cootamundra to catch the
Southern Mail for Melbourne. Old Larry kissed his daughter in
overflowing mood. "Sure, what you've done is so right and full of
common sense that I can see good luck shinin' ahead of ye like a
great white road."</p>

<p>Aileen wept becomingly&mdash;the best of good form for a bride.
She could not confide in her elder half-sisters, nor her careless
half-brother, Larry, nor in her silly mother, puffed like a frog
with pride and satisfaction. The Healeys were well pleased with
their attainment financially and socially.</p>

<p>Not only the Bool Bool <i>Courier</i> recorded every jam-spoon
and antimacassar presented to the happy couple, but the <i>Town and
Country Journal</i> had nearly a column.</p>

<p>Old Bill Prendergast had been commissioned to do his best and
responded with a newly painted carriage and his peerless greys in
heavily plated harness. Very fine the turnout looked clipping clown
Stanton Street and across the bridge and the flats in the direction
of Saunders Plains, to rise on a farther eminence and disappear in
the glittering day on the grey ribbon of road towards the Nanda
ranges.</p>

<p>Bool Bool returned to its stewed fruit and junket&mdash;popular
summer fare. Its bridge opening and ball, the spree of rumours
preceding its grand wedding, the wedding itself, had been peaks of
interest in the prosaic flats of everyday existence.</p>

<p>Ronald's love affair faded. Many of his elders had had an equal
or greater reverse and now as ageing patresfamilias or expanding
grandmammas were none the worse. Old Larry Healey himself had had
several, and two wives. Tim Brennan of The Gap had had a whopper,
so had Ned Stanton, brother of the latest bridegroom, and Hugh
Mazere, son of Great-grandma, had been thrown over, after public
engagement, by old Miss M'Eachern; and goodness me, to look at her
now she did not seem much to miss. Old Mrs Bill Prendergast, now a
shapeless waddling mass, for all she was upholstered in wonderful
silks and hung with jewellery, and always with such a squint that
it rendered her almost non-human, had nevertheless on a lower
stratum once wrought desolation among stockmen and bullockies from
Mungee to Gundagai.</p>

<p>Ronald did not expose his heart. He would have found no sympathy
at home and did not want to be a butt abroad. He was too busy and
too much under his family's eye to take to drink, though in spite
of drinking no toasts he had been very drunk the night of the
wedding, but so were Dan Spires and Tommy Roper and Cross-eyed
Prendergast and Billings and a few more. Mr Eustace Blenkinsop,
English gentleman at large, and Teddy O'Mara, untamed
horse-breaker, sat down and wept together on the front veranda of
M'Haffety's Hotel, regardless of social codes or witnesses, for the
simple reason that they could not stand up either singly or
arm-in-arm, but it was all of trivial rather than tragic import,
and ludicrous in the consequences to Mr Blenkinsop.</p>

<p>That was the start of a spree upon which he spent the last of
his quarterly remittance on whisky, a tin of boiled lollies, and a
bag of onions. The sweets were to propitiate society, the onions to
comfort a tongue debauched. His delirium was sustained till he
spilt the sweets along the aisle at Sunday service and solemnly
offered the onions at various drawing-rooms including the vicarage,
the bank, and Three Rivers, to the delight of the wags that abound
in bush townships. However, in a circle inured to similar family
skeletons, and in view of the occasion, it was minimized as his
first outbreak of such magnitude, and opportunely he was retiring
to Ten Creeks, removed from temptation. "Such a gentlemanly old
feller even when he's drunk that it's impossible to help liking
him!"</p>

<p>The drought continued. The bodies of sheep falling as they
reached the promised land punctuated the Route even as the earlier
beeves, whose hides were now dry and empty. The crows and dingoes
had a good season, the drovers and their employers a hard one. The
employers had shattering losses. The drovers had plenty of work
with all the world of shifting stock but it was in a world of
shifting sand and stinging flies, and disheartening to crawl all
day long tortured by sandy blight behind weak suffering animals on
a route already littered with stinking carcasses, to the
accompaniment of a devil's chorus of crows, to deliver half the
flock with which they started.</p>

<p>Owing to the severity of the drought, SP-over-J did not extend
his honeymoon to Tasmania. Aileen did not seem to care whether she
travelled or not. She acquiesced in every suggestion in a way that
was paradisiacal to the shah that is in all men, even in old
SP-over-J. It was a novelty after his experience of the
Stanton-Saunders-Mazere clans, who were mostly stiff-necked and
spirited females and mule-stubborn males. After a while it
bewildered him. There seemed nothing to catch hold of. He recalled
with relief the early opposition of his sisters. There was
something natural in that. He was glad to hear from Lucy that she
was preparing the house at Ten Creeks for the bride. The heat was
so intense that he intended to return there.</p>

<p>He bought Aileen extravagant clothes compiled by fashionable
dressmakers and was proud of the sensation caused by her beauty,
but it contained the sting that elderly bridegrooms with purchased
wives unfailingly suffer. Even the most tactful shop and hotel
attendants would mistake him for Pa, while dashing fellows were
deliberate with the thrust. SP-over-J was relieved that Bool
Boolians did not witness his discomfiture, and the apathetic Aileen
did not seem to be aware of it. He wished it had been practical
politics to have Milly with them. The youngster must have changed,
he reflected, under the influence of old Blenkinsop. Not long since
he felt she had merited summary correction, but she was
surprisingly nice about his wedding. She had been at the carriage
door at the departure. "You know, Uncle Jack and Aunt Aileen, you
can count on me when you come home if you want me to keep you
company at Ten Creeks Run, or anything."</p>

<p>"Would you like Milly to keep you company when we go home?"
Stanton inquired one day as he and his bride were strolling in the
Botanic Gardens.</p>

<p>"It would be nice, but just as you like."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have her, then." It would be refreshing to hear
Milly declaring as flatly as a smoothing-iron whether she did or
did not like a proposal.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p>It was the second day of the Bool Bool Show.</p>

<p>The hall where the ball had been held was full of fruit and
grain and vegetables, samples of women's needlework and cooking and
children's school exercises. Table decorations that had won prizes
the day before were wilted now. The draught-horses and bulls and
rams had won their blue ribbons, as had also the farm produce, the
cockadoodles and ducks and canaries, and old Mrs Mazere's pot
plants and honey and preserves. The merry-go-round was doing a
stirring business. Many hundreds of watermelons had been consumed
in great pink slices on Watermelon Hill and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Old Tom Saunders's prize dairy cow had been milked in the
morning, and Diamond, son of Nanko, one of the aboriginal old
hands, had requested a drink. He had been ordered to hold his hat.
There was more than he could swallow; he passed some to his friend,
Teddy O'Mara. It was also too much for him and the silly creatures
put on their hats, milk and all, with the result that their beards
when dry were as if dipped in cold starch, and pursued by the flies
like honey.</p>

<p>The wits had not recovered from this side-splitting fun when
they were enlivened by a shindy between old Parsons and Porter,
farmers on the Three River flats. For several years Porter had von
first prize for the best bag and sheaf wheat with the same
specimens. Celebrating at the Show the previous year, Parsons,
carrying his liquor better, had treated the prizewinner till he was
dead drunk and then purchased from him the prize specimens. This
year, when grain was pinched with drought, Parsons took both prizes
with Porter's ancient exhibit. Ferocious language ensued in the
hall. Porter with a stout stick threshed the prize sheaf forthwith
before the company. He then gathered up the straw and striding
across the ring to the judges' box strewed it upon the gentlemen,
local and imported, complacently smoking there, with his opinion of
them as fools and duffers and liars and hypocrites, etc., who would
not know oats from barley.</p>

<p>Pillaloo!</p>

<p>Porter next fed the prize bag wheat to the prize hens and
turkeys of the Riddalls and Browns, and from their pens extracted
eggs to paint his perfidious rival's hat and beard till he was more
distinguished than Teddy and Diamond.</p>

<p>A most diverting forenoon!</p>

<p>Mr Blenkinsop, English aristocrat and kindly soul to boot,
sought to aid peace by inviting the belligerents to a cool drink
with him. Porter and Parsons were flattered, but one of them spoke
contemptuously of shandygaff, and Mr Blenkinsop felt constrained to
take them to the Woolpack where real spirits could be procured.
They set off in Parsons's old buggy unnoticed except by the rabble
about the gates.</p>

<p>All seats were occupied regardless of the sun to watch the "lady
jumpers", first on the afternoon programme.</p>

<p>"Dot Saunders is the best lady jumper in the colony," said Mrs
Isaacs, in her front seat in the grandstand.</p>

<p>"Sure, I wonder annyone bothers to compete against her annywhere
after what the Governor himself said about her last year," said Mrs
M'Haffety.</p>

<p>"Mostly it's the smallest waist, not the best rider, takes the
prize," said Isaacs.</p>

<p>"That's thrue! Ould Richard Mazere, whin he is judging, has a
weak of for the woman rayther than the horse."</p>

<p>"There's more like him," observed the Mayoress.</p>

<p>"But Dot is the best jumper as well as having the smallest
waist," contended Mrs Isaacs.</p>

<p>Dot was taking her turn in the ladies' hunters, on one of
Poole's personally gentled thoroughbreds. He took his hurdles with
economy of action, and never clouted the rails, a perfectly
mannered beast, but ahead of his day. More popular with the crowd
was the chestnut of Miss Polly M'Ginty of Mungee Crossing Hotel,
who stood on her hind legs and pawed the air at the entrance and
backed and bucked away from the leap. It took a couple of men to
lead her into the ring. Polly was of lower social stratum and
vociferously barracked for by all the boundary-riders and drovers
and breakers and dealers and spielers that the meeting attracted.
She was a heavier woman than Dot and laced to the last inch in a
skin-tight habit. From her bosom, harnessed to the contour of a
stuffed Christmas turkey, protruded her gold watch-chain, and a
horseshoe brooch fastened her choking collar. A jockey's cap let
the sun burn her face crimson, and was not nearly so becoming as
Dot's bell-topper with its floating white veil.</p>

<p>At last Polly's Lottery went at her hurdle with such fury that
the sleeve of her rider's habit was torn from the armhole, and
there extruded something white like a calico shirt&mdash;wonderful
how women lived and breathed and rode terrific horses in the stays
and layers of rags that the mentality of that day conceived as
God-imposed on womanly females!</p>

<p>Miss M'Ginty was applauded as properly modest that a white
petticoat, much befrilled, could be discerned inside her skirt. Dot
the practical, it could be detected, wore quite mannish breeks
beneath her taut skirt, and wantonly exhibited her shape. It was
such an attractive contour that "nuff said", as the wags of her
prime expressed it. There was certainly enough said at the time by
the judges of virtue and convention.</p>

<p>Lottery, in her excitement, struck the rails, jarring her
rider's back and knocking many points off her chances. Dot, cool
and slim, was coming round a second time on Princess, her own
celebrated mare. She popped over so neatly that it was impossible
without carefully calculated points to tell whether this or Poole's
Oedipus was the better. Poole's horse had been named by his old
stepmother, and many of the squattocracy thought the name referred
to a species of frog.</p>

<p>Another rider had a treasure in Larry Healey's mare The Bird,
and yet another in Beeswing, belonging to Ronald Dice. There were a
dozen others as well, and while the judges were walking the horses
round and walking round the horses and measuring and estimating,
Milly, instigated by youthful admirers, slipped into the ring and
ran Romp at the stiff four-railed jump set for the men's hunters.
The little roan cleared it with inches to spare, licking her chops
to be at it again. Amid cheers there were cries of, "Give all the
prizes for the ladies to the youngster: she's won 'em by long
chalks." "Give her a special prize, one for herself and another for
the filly!" "Send round the hat!"</p>

<p>"That settles it!" said Milly's mother to her sister. "She is
getting quite out of hand. She must go to a good stiff school for a
couple of years to take the nonsense out of her. She does what she
likes with poor old Mr Blenkinsop."</p>

<p>"Has he been on the spree since?"</p>

<p>"He hasn't had the chance, but I think it punctured his poise a
little."</p>

<p>By order of her mother in the grandstand and her great-uncle in
the judges' box, further exhibitions by Milly were stopped, but two
pairs of eyes were directed, one towards the filly and the other
towards her rider, with intense admiration as they left the ring.
The first was Jack Bowes, the second young Larry Healey.</p>

<p>A column of dust like a smoke barrage announced the approach of
a vehicle from the fiats across the bridge and soon it was
whispered that SP-over-J and his new wife had returned from the
honeymoon. They proceeded directly to the grandstand, the stir of
their passage for a time eclipsing the drama in the ring. Dot
relaxed interest in the points of the ladies' hunters to note if
Aileen's arrival disturbed Ronald, but she could detect no sign.
Milly summoned the nearest vassal to take charge of Romp. It was
Billy Bowes, but they were at loggerheads, and Larry sprang
forward, so to him Milly entrusted her adored.</p>

<p>She reached the space before the grandstand and kissed her uncle
and aunt, all eyes upon them, some for the smart Melbourne bonnet
the size of a cup with a sash tied under the bride's chin, and
others to see how the wearer looked, and if there were indications
of a broken heart or approaching motherhood, and how old Jack might
be weathering it. Aileen was amiable as ever, and quite animated
for her.</p>

<p>"What is on?" she asked, taking her seat.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen's hunters, just starting," said Norah.</p>

<p>"There goes Tommy Roper on old Albatross, see him soaring over
the sticks like a bird."</p>

<p>"There's young Larry on Abracadabra, a devil of a horse, but
Larry could ride a steam engine."</p>

<p>"Is Dice entering Spondulix this year?" inquired someone in a
voice purposely loud.</p>

<p>"Ssssh! He was shot under him: didn't you hear?"</p>

<p>"Here comes Dice now on a horse of Poole's."</p>

<p>Some of the curious saw, or thought they saw, Aileen's face pale
as though she were going to faint, and said that her heart was in
her eyes as she looked towards the best of riders on the best of
beasts, all natural grace and unstudied efficiency, but others said
that some people were so weak-minded and sentimental that they
could see anything in any face that they wanted to. None could
detect that Ronald glanced in the direction of Aileen, and he was
in the ring longer than any other rider. He won in the pairs with
Dot, and following that they seemed to enjoy each other
tremendously. They rode on the merry-go-round, they ate watermelon
together, and all was as it should have been&mdash;a young man who
had caterwauled after one beauty removed from him by a wealthier
suitor, was seemingly just as taken with another, a sight and
incident far commoner than a prize bull at an agricultural
show.</p>

<p>"Sure, look at Ronald and Dot," observed Mrs M'Haffety. "'Tis
plain to be seen he's forgotten Aileen entirely."</p>

<p>"He couldn't have thought much of her, then," said Rebecca. "Ah,
'tis Aileen will be glad now that she did not listen to his noise.
Sure, anny gurrul who depinds on a man's affections is not knowing
much of thim."</p>

<p>"They're all right if they're everlasting looked after, but you
cannot afford to let them slip."</p>

<p>"Lord save us, what's this!"</p>

<p>This had reference to the two farmers with Mr Blenkinsop,
Diamond, and Teddy O'Mara, who had returned from the hotel in a
state of complete equality&mdash;no, not exactly complete; Parsons
and Porter still had the sanity to hoe their own furrow, however
unsteadily, but the two naturals were as a single thought under Mr
Blenkinsop's baton.</p>

<p>Uncle Jack was taking Milly and her new aunt, his sister and
several other clan members for refreshments when they were
confronted by a changed mortal. Gone was the exquisitely
conventional surface. Mr Blenkinsop's clothes were covered with
dust, his hat over his ear, his face flaring red as he reeled
precariously from side to side, a bag of onions under one arm and a
tin of boiled lollies under the other.</p>

<p>He swayed up to Aileen, with one hand on Diamond and the other
on Teddy O'Mara, his merchandise escaping him. He tried to pick it
up, so did his aides-de-camp, and all three rolled together. Teddy
sat up and laughed, his stiff white beard now encrusted with dust
like a statue, and chanted:</p>

<p>"Me feyther and mother were Irish, And I was Irish, too; We
bought a tin kettle for ninepence, And knocked up an Irish
stoo!"</p>

<p>Diamond wiggled on his belly after the onions, boys grabbed
fistfuls of the sweets, cheering and calling, "Go it, Diamond!" "Go
it, Teddy O'Mara!"</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Eusty Blenkinsop, esquire, two ends of a rogue
and a liar!"</p>

<p>Porter and Parsons, carrying themselves better, helped their
comrade to his feet and he addressed Aileen, "Ah, Marchioness, I'll
see you tonight in the conservatory when we can get away from this
rabble. You needn't pretend you don't want to&mdash;you had a
different tale till your clod of a husband came along with his
money and title."</p>

<p>Stanton drew his wife aside. "You are not yourself, Blenkinsop,
you'd better go to bed."</p>

<p>"Yes, leave the young lady alone," said Parsons, "she's married
the old feller now and there's no use in playing up about it."</p>

<p>The lamb had become a lion. "How dare you address me! Serfs,
clods, descendants of criminals and menials, fellows with neither
education nor breeding&mdash;and I, Eustace Blenkinsop
Osgood&mdash;to think that this is my lot year after year, to
associate year after year with inferiors&mdash;people more ignorant
than my father's bailiff and tradesmen...Stand up, Diamond and
Teddy O'Mara, I am associating with you to show what I think of the
society to which I am reduced. I shall take you both to call on all
the first families round Bool Bool&mdash;you are just as worthy to
enjoy my society as these other grooms and galoots. To think that I
must spend my days in such a milieu! I, Eustace. Up, Diamond! Come
on, O'Mara, I of ancient lineage will..."</p>

<p>Such a crowd had collected that Stanton took his wife out of it
while the wits enjoyed the association of Diamond and Teddy with
the blooming English swell. A constable came to restore order.
Parsons and Porter were claimed by their embarrassed families. The
constable would have locked the other two up but for the
intervention of Mrs Labosseer.</p>

<p>"Teddy O'Mara, get up at once! Go and sit in the shade of my
buggy till you are able to sit on your horse and then ride straight
home to Coolooluk. You hear what I say!" Teddy recognized the voice
of authority and staggered off obediently. "Diamond, you ought to
be whipped. You go straight back to camp at once." The constable
escorted one of the last of a vanishing tribe outside the gates and
let him lie down under a tree to be eaten by the flies till he
should be able to travel, and warned the boys not to touch
them.</p>

<p>"Those poor creatures haven't sense, but what are we to think of
those who sell liquor to them or those who laugh at their state,"
said Mrs Labosseer. "I hope I shall live to see the day that those
who sell liquor to the simple and those who jeer at them are
horsewhipped." Such was her rectitude and personality that the wags
slunk away, bottling their delight in the incident for
reminiscence.</p>

<p>The downfall of Mr Blenkinsop was a sensation. There was no one
but himself to whom it mattered, so Mrs Labosseer, with a sense of
Christian responsibility, again came to the rescue. She got her son
Eric to take him to Three Rivers. "Poor old man has no one to take
care of him. Ask Charlotte to take him in, and as soon as he is fit
to travel I'll take him to Coolooluk till he recovers, unless, of
course, Jack Stanton is prepared to take him to Ten Creeks, though
he is no fit tutor for Milly after this."</p>

<p>"Glory be! Who'd have thought it!" said Mrs M'Haffety. "Sure,
perhaps 'tis to be seen whoi his family unloaded him on the
colonies."</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you! Men may seem lambs, but it's wives who know
their own sorrer with them."</p>

<p>"This beloike is the ind of his career as a fine gentleman among
us. The ould scut! Who'd have thought he could be so
insultin'!"</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Milly went home to Ten Creeks with her new aunt, much against
her mother's wish, but she was in such favour with her uncle that
Mrs Saunders's wishes were outweighed. Milly's older relatives
considered she was getting out of hand, and would become an oddity
if steps were not taken to tame her. In face of the collapse of Mr
Blenkinsop she was the subject of family discussion.</p>

<p>In a different circle she might have been hailed as a prodigy,
but in hers any outstanding character or intelligence was
disparaged as eccentricity. She might find scope for unusual energy
in prodigies of household operations that jeopardized the peace of
her associates, or she could be the horsewoman and whip of the age;
though her cousin Dot did not escape aspersions of horsiness, and
the opinion that what she needed to settle her was a husband and
half a dozen children.</p>

<p>As the months passed, Mrs Saunders liked less and less Milly's
association with the Healey boys, one of whom was always at Ten
Creeks, while Milly herself did not care for Joanna, who also took
up her residence there to keep Aileen company. Aileen, in Booth,
needed a companion for herself and to relieve SP-over-J.
Approaching motherhood made her a suffering and impossible sleeping
companion. Towards the end of the year she was for ever waking up
screaming because of snakes that pursued her in all guises, and the
marriage bed in the last century was a pen from which a spouse
could not lightly desert. Stanton, in whom habits of solitude and
singleness were deeply ingrained, was glad to abdicate to a
sister-in-law. Even he agreed that Milly was growing too
old-fashioned, and at New Year helped with the wherewithal to send
her to Miss Lisset's most select establishment for young ladies at
Edgecliff, Woollahra, where none but the daughters of pure merinos
were catered for. Milly was eligible because there was no
unpunctuality in her fees and she belonged to one of the oldest and
most respected pioneer clans in the Southern Districts.</p>

<p>When her departure was settled she asked Uncle Bert to take care
of Romp during her absence. Poole rode from Curradoobidgee to say
good-bye to Milly and to take charge of the pony personally. Milly
laid upon him a firm injunction, "Don't let that awful Flash Billy
touch a hair of her head or tail or he would be sure to spoil her
in some way."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p>Milly was absent nearly two years. Her mother, to keep her from
the Healeys, went to Sydney during some of her vacations, and Milly
had spent others with school friends.</p>

<p>Life from Bool Bool to Monaro and Ten Creeks Run and thereabouts
pottered along. The drought had been followed by such wet years
that bottle and fluke and all the ills of too much rain were
prevalent. Norah and Joanna Healey were both ranged. Propinquity
with Joanna had done for Dan Spires, the overseer. Dan had selected
towards Wamgambril Springs and they were dragging to make a home.
Norah's disappearances from Neangen, to stay at Ten Creeks with
Aily, seeing what had come to Joanna, had stirred Alf Timson at
last, and he and Norah were established comfortably enough at
Billy-go-Billy. Old Mrs Poole, Bert's stepmother, had died high in
her eighties, and Bert was without a permanent housekeeper.
Aileen's baby was in his second year, a fine child, but his mother
did not recover from his advent. She was listless and backachy, and
the child seemed too much for her even with the aid of the best
nurse girls procurable. She could not endure the heat of Riverina
and so Ten Creeks saw more of the family than usual. SP-over-J was
secretly mortified to have made a wreck of his bride, and for
pride's sake spared no expense for attempted medical
reconstruction.</p>

<p>Poole's state had been discussed by the oracles of Bool Bool.
"He'll be sure to marry now. While the old lady was there she was a
great boss, they say, but now we'll see what will happen. There may
be a chance for old Miss M'Eachern yet, and there's the two
Farquharsons at Keba and the Dice girls at Bookaledgeree."</p>

<p>"He'll be dhruv to marry now, but it will take a lot of dhriving
to get him towards Lucy Saunders or anny of thim others. He'll
surprise us by bringing home some flibbertigibbet from the town.
Whin they get ould in the horn they are niver contint with wan of
their own age. Look at ould Jack Stanton."</p>

<p>Milly arrived in Bool Bool one morning unwarrantedly, but
preceded by lengthy telegraphic communications from Miss Lisset.
The reason of this appearance was the news received from Uncle Bert
that Romp was lost, though she had been stabled every night or kept
in the orchard with a six-foot paling fence, as she had already
shown the tendencies of her high-flying dam. It was an appalling
catastrophe to Milly. Without permission she left immediately for
Bool Bool. Poole met her at Goulburn, so deeply did he feel this
end to the guardianship of the sacred filly. When morning came and
Milly disinterred herself from her rug and stepped out on the
platform, he was startled to find her no longer a child.</p>

<p>"Uncle Bert," she said, after the sleepiness had vanished, "I do
so appreciate your thoughtfulness in coming to meet me like this. I
know it has been an unavoidable accident. I am inclined to think
there is something underneath. Where is Flash Billy?"</p>

<p>"Droving down the Bland the last I heard of him. He and Tommy
Roper had a contract to go to Queensland."</p>

<p>"How did he come to leave Ten Creeks?"</p>

<p>"He and your Uncle Jack fell out over Billy's methods with young
'uns. I warned Billy the time of the muster when he taught
Corroboree and the filly bad tricks."</p>

<p>"I bet he has done something with Romp for spite."</p>

<p>"That would be rather roundabout, wouldn't it? Romp never meant
anything to your Uncle Jack."</p>

<p>"Yes but it was through Romp and me that Billy got found out. I
was the one who always said straight out what I thought of
him."</p>

<p>"You must be careful never to let prejudice make you unfair,
Milly old girl. Billy, I reckon, behaved as well as he knew how; he
never had much of a bringing up."</p>

<p>"I shan't say a word to anyone but you."</p>

<p>"That reminds me, the night of the bridge opening, Billy brought
Romp back to Three Rivers. She had broken out of the orchard and
would have got away only for Billy."</p>

<p>"You never told me."</p>

<p>"Forgot it till this brought it up."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry if I've had wrongful thoughts of Billy. If Romp
hasn't been stolen she would make back to Ten Creeks."</p>

<p>Poole could not keep his glances from his young friend, and her
general appearance and composed vivacity of manner attracted
admiration from strangers. She was assuredly a young woman, though
her hair was still in a plait and her skirts short. Her velvet hat
was tipped away from her face and had a smart bow dangling at the
back; her dress was to the tops of her neat buttoned boots and made
with the prevailing bustle at the back; the sleeves outlined her
round young arms snugly, and were met with gloves half-way to the
elbow; the materials were quiet but good, the ensemble decidedly
fashionable. She had a "figure", with the slim waist and other
rounded lines, indispensable to beauty in her day, already plainly
indicated. Miss Lisset's was renowned for deportment, and all
Milly's actions were instinct with energy and grace. Her features
were irregular, but her eyes and mouth were frank, expressive, and
winning; her complexion, rooted in radiant health, and now rid of
freckles, was rosy, and her sincerity and freedom from affectation
or unreasonableness made her a favourite. Poole noted that her
collar was fastened with a childish brooch he had given her, and
decided to present her with another befitting her budding
womanhood.</p>

<p>She insisted upon going straight to Ten Creeks though only men
were there, it being August and the worst winter weather still to
run. Poole felt this awkward now that Milly seemed so grown up, but
to break this to her was not possible inside delicacy. Aileen and
SP-over-J were at Turrill Turrill. Lucy Saunders was at Stanton's
Plains, and as a married caretaker was on the Run, she volunteered
with such willingness to go up with Milly, that Poole sensed here a
fresh, or rather an old danger. This he obviated by suggesting that
the headquarters of the hunt should be Jinninjinninbong over the
river. This held. The Mesdames Milford were glad of visitors to
enliven the isolation of their winter season when often weeks
passed without a fresh face appearing, while the Milford brothers,
in Poole's idea, were worth half a dozen of the rouseabouts or
boundary-riders that operated on Ten Creeks Run.</p>

<p>Poole had offered a reward of &pound;50, but Romp had not yet
been traced. The night of her disappearance had been marked by
heavy snow, wiping out all possibility of tracking her. The
suspicion was that she had been stolen by someone who had awaited
such weather. If not, it was argued that she would make back to
where she had been bred.</p>

<p>A tremendous search began. Bushmen thought nothing of a few
score miles to serve an old crone or a bearded and blasphemous
brother, and youth and beauty in feminine form was enough to send
them riding a thousand miles in their dreams. Several blades were
there because they had caught a glimpse of the new Milly in process
of being turned out by Miss Lisset. Foremost was Larry Healey, who
had seen her arrive at Bool Bool, where he hung about Dot Saunders,
which he assumed the right to do since his sister had entered the
clan. Another was Cross-eyed Prendergast, who saw Milly take the
coach at Gundagai, and his crony Billings to whom he had imparted
the news. Someone going for the mail had told the Farquharsons and
Cuppinbingle, and, things being slack, old Mick Muldoon thought he
might as well take a turn up, so did his master, who was always
interested in a promising filly, equine or human, especially human,
and the whisper of Milly's points had reached him. He and Alistair
Farquharson travelled together. Hearing that Poole and Cuppinbingle
Potter were to be members of the search, Rose Farquharson said she
would accompany her brother and pay a call on Mrs Milford.</p>

<p>When the hunt had been out a number of days Long Billy, the
senior Ten Creeks rouseabout, announced that he had picked up the
tracks of a shod horse among the brumbies out by Gyang Gyang Creek
at the back of Mount Corroboree, where the black-fellows' Borah
rings faintly exist to this day. He persisted in this story though
he could not find the tracks again for others to examine.</p>

<p>"Sure, he couldn't thrack a fowl!" said Mick Muldoon. "He
couldn't tell the difference betune the thrack of the filly and a
bull in spring tearin' up the scrub with his horns and pawin'
dhrains all round."</p>

<p>But as there was no other trail, the seekers proceeded in that
direction, and Long Billy and Teddy O'Mara were led by crows to the
remains of Romp. She lay near the Corroboree rings under a cliff of
granite; the fissures of which had of old harboured tons of bogongs
for the feasts of the aborigines in their ceremonial retreats.
Crows and dingoes had done their work, but it was a shod horse with
a hogged black mane and tail, and enough of the hide remaining to
establish that it was blue roan, and blue roans were scarcer than
red roans or piebalds or black-dappled greys.</p>

<p>It was a depressed party that mustered at Jinninjinninbong that
disagreeable sleeting evening. To Teddy O'Mara was left the
breaking of the news. Milly refused to be satisfied. She wanted the
hide for tanning, but the scavengers of the bush had spoiled that.
"She was in a flinty gully, missy, under a great wall, and must
have lost her footing and broke her neck," said Teddy.</p>

<p>"Someone must have pushed her over," sobbed Milly. "She'd never
be so clumsy as to lose her footing. She was bred there."</p>

<p>"Ah, but the horse that doesn't lose his footing sometimes
hasn't been foaled yet," said Alistair Farquharson.</p>

<p>"Yes, but Romp wouldn't fall over that precipice, she knew the
place. Horses don't make mistakes like that. I want to go out and
see her myself. If she had been some old screw that didn't know the
mountains it would be different. Did you leave her there, just as
she was? Poor little thing, to be torn to pieces by dingoes and
those vile old crows!"</p>

<p>Milly was all child again before this bereavement. The men felt
convicted of barbarity to have left the remains unburnt or
unburied. Alistair volunteered to carry out this duty, while Milly
had to go back to school immediately. This she consented to,
meekly, also to contrite apologies to Miss Lisset for her
highhanded action in leaving her establishment. Miss Lisset,
however, understood Milly and was a friend in this crisis. Milly
never gave the trouble generated by some of the meek specimens who
were all and more than convention demanded.</p>

<p>Thus Milly was banished again till the following Christmas
twelve-months, when she was to return home to take up life on the
plane of an adult of seventeen.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p>Ronald Dice had not seemed to be aware of Aileen at the fool
Bool Show the day she returned from her honeymoon, and no word or
message of any sort passed between the young people thereafter.
Shortly afterwards Dice left the district. He naturally desired a
change. He went to the Macfarlanes of Junee, who had summered their
stock on Bookaledgeree and who gave him a post as manager of one of
their stations down the river.</p>

<p>It was during the winter that Romp was lost that SP-over-J sent
Aileen to Melbourne to a specialist renowned in such cases. Norah
took charge of the baby at Turrill Turrill, and Aileen was quite
well enough to travel alone after being put carefully into her
carriage at Wagga Wagga, with the guard aware that it would be to
his interest to see her through the customs and intransigent change
of trains at Albury.</p>

<p>Aileen, with a cup of horrible tea and her own breakfast, was
comfortably seated when an agile young man dashed into her
compartment and banged the door after him. Aileen looked up
startled. It was Ronald Dice.</p>

<p>How handsome and young he looked belting into the moving train
in the reckless way he swung on and off a horse; so different from
SP-over-J, riding blood horses too spirited for his years and
hop-hop-hopping with one leg and clinging to the pommel till at
last he clambered up.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ronnie!" she breathed, her pale face flooding with unusual
colour.</p>

<p>"Great Scott! It's you! How the deuce...Well, it can't be
helped! I never dreamt of finding you here. I'll get out at the
first stop. Don't be frightened. I shan't eat you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ronnie, I'm not frightened. How could I be, of you!" she
breathed, joy lighting her frail face, irresistibly appealing. She
had nothing else to say. She was not a talker, nor was she
embarrassed thereby. She just looked at her vis-&agrave;-vis and
smiled.</p>

<p>"Have some of my breakfast."</p>

<p>"No, thanks...Say, Aileen, just tell me one thing, and then I'll
never bother you again."</p>

<p>"What is it?" She was so gentle, so defenceless, that stricture
eased in him. He was casting off something that had constantly
pricked for more than two years.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you answer the letter I left with you that night?
You might have had the decency to do that. You led me on to think
you cared as much as I did. I was dead in earnest, and that was a
good square offer, and you were twenty-one and had the right to
defy your parents if you wanted to. You might have known how
serious it was to me. Why did you let me go on till Spondulix was
shot under me, risking my life and making a fool of myself before
the whole country? Just one word that you had changed your mind
would have been enough."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I never changed my mind. I did care just like you did,"
said Aileen, earnestly, spontaneously candid. Then she paled with
dismay, to realize the irregularity of this confession now that she
was a wife and mother.</p>

<p>"That's what you led me to believe! Well, you might have left a
little note, not let me ride the tails off all the horses night
after night for nothing till I was sick at heart."</p>

<p>"Oh, but Ronnie, I did&mdash;I tried, I mean. I got away at last
and wrote a letter to say I would meet you, and when I got to the
old post"&mdash;she recoiled in horror in the recollection&mdash;"I
was just putting my hand into the big mortice hole when a monster
black snake whizzed past. I thought it had bitten me at first, and
I jumped back nearly on to another. Oh, Ronnie, it was terrible! It
seemed like an omen. I never could try again, and they all took
fine care I had no chance of sending you a letter. It seemed as if
luck was against me." She was weeping now, hopelessly,
uncontrolledly, relievedly. They had the world to
themselves&mdash;a world of bushland with queenly trees, their
silver-green foliage glinting in the morning sun. They were sealed
in their own company for hours unless some accident stopped the
train. Fate was giving them the opportunity that the snakes had
frustrated, thought Dice; he had not Aileen's hesitancies.</p>

<p>"Is that true?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I've dreamt of those snakes ever since. Snakes come after
me when I try to sleep till they are driving me mad. The doctors, I
know, think I am mental, and talk about hallucinations and curing
me of my 'obsession'."</p>

<p>"You needn't worry about the bally snakes any more. I'm sure
they will be killed. I'm glad you have told me, but if you felt
like that, why didn't you just slip out and come to me? The day you
got as far as the old post, were you riding?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh dear, dear! Why didn't you gallop straight on to me? All we
had to do was clear out to Miss Mac. She was waiting to stand by
us."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ronnie, I couldn't do such a thing! I had Julie with me.
She would have gone back and told Pa and they would have given
chase and perhaps have shot us both."</p>

<p>"No damn' fear! Julie would have followed you most of the way
and by the time she got back to tell them we would have had a good
start."</p>

<p>"But supposing you had been away from home. Oh, Ronnie, you
don't blame me, do you?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't blame you, but you've made a hell of a mess of
everything by not playing up to me ever so little." He could not be
cruel now. He knew that the action he outlined had been beyond
Aileen's timorous nature. His gorge rose against the ogres who had
surrounded her. He would gladly have strangled both Larrys, and as
for old Skinny Guts&mdash;cowardly old death adder to trap a
girl&mdash;he deserved to be thrown in a pit full of tiger snakes
and adders. There was no hope of his dying yet. He was not much
past sixty and like all useless old crawlers took superb care of
himself.</p>

<p>Aileen continued to weep so pitifully that Dice feared she would
be ill on his hands. He had heard tales of her hysteria and
delicacy, from home, not without comments on her tainted heredity
and what he had luckily missed. He saw now that there was nothing
wrong with the poor little girl, as gentle as an angel and unfitted
to cope with the sharks among which fate had pitched her.</p>

<p>"Cheer up!" he said, wrenching himself from fierce regret and
wiping her eyes on his handkerchief, hers being inadequate. "I'm
glad you have told me this. It has lifted a hundred thousand tons
off me to know you weren't pulling my leg."</p>

<p>"I never thought of doing such a terrible thing," she sobbed.
"Well then, there's no need to cry. I feel like throwing up my
hat."</p>

<p>"But it's all too late now. I might as well be dead," she
wailed.</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it. A live dog is better any day than an ark
full of dead lions. Cheer up, we can still see each other. There is
no law in the world to prevent that."</p>

<p>"Yes, we can see each other, that will be nice." She cheered
perceptibly immediately.</p>

<p>"You bet your bottom dollar it will be nice." The young man was
reflecting savagely that he owed no loyalty to any person around
Aileen. They brought on themselves anything that might happen. As
for the old Death Adder, he was a symbol of the snakes that had
worked on his side, and relentless determination overcame young
Dice, so gay and good-natured that he was a byword.</p>

<p>Aileen's head rested on Ronald's shoulder as he soothed her.
Soon he had her smiling at his observations. Later they had a jolly
picnic meal together. Dice got tea at a station and bribed the
guard to keep people away from their compartment. Aileen, rapt in
the bliss of the passing hour, felt the despair of years disperse.
Just to have Ronald near once more was balm to her frazzled nerves.
The past fell away, the future was unshaped. She had no thought of
impropriety. With Ronald it was a different matter. His purpose was
devoid of qualms, but lack of illicit experience would restrain him
more than he could estimate.</p>

<p>The heavenly hours vanished and the outskirts of Melbourne were
outside the windows.</p>

<p>"We're nearly there. Oh, Ronnie, when shall I see you again?
There can be no harm in us just seeing each other?" Her words were
a quivering plea.</p>

<p>"No harm at all! Of course we'll see each other all we jolly
well want to. I reckon I had better not disturb you in Melbourne.
You hang on to that old specialist johnny and get strong. I'm only
down with a few special fats that have gone on ahead in trucks and
shan't have more than a night or perhaps two in Melbourne. Are you
going up to Ten Creeks this spring?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The heat at Turrill Turrill knocks me out completely."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll see you up there. Macfarlane has Goraig Flats
for the summer and gave me the offer of managing. I'll be right on
your way to Stanton's Plains, you can stay and have midday grub
with inc. I might have one of the girls to housekeep."</p>

<p>"That will be heaven!"</p>

<p>"You bet it will! I'll drop over some Saturday nights. Now,
remember, no more snakes or any tommy-rot like that."</p>

<p>Aileen was smiling radiantly. Dice stooped and kissed her.
"There, I had a right to kiss the bride on the wedding day, so I'll
do it now. Better late than never."</p>

<p>He picked up his valise and had gone before Aileen was met and
taken away in a carriage. She went like one in a dream, a
comfortable glowing dream free from snakes and death adders.
Melbourne was a lovely city.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p>The year of the loss of the Young Whisker filly, a new scandal
entertained the curious about Bool Bool.</p>

<p>The Saunderses were a narrow-minded conventional family. In
early days there had been rumours that the original Saunders need
not have been condescending to ticket-of-leave men, but never more
than rumours. Old James Saunders had founded a family of great
rectitude, especially as concerned the straitlaced virtue of its
women. Against any of the daughters or daughters' daughters there
had never been a suggestion of irregularity till now there were
whispers about Dot. These were not long in reaching the two
arch-priestesses of the local news service.</p>

<p>"Haven't you noticed?" Mrs Isaacs bent forward and whispered
portentously, though they were quite alone in the private parlour
of the hotel.</p>

<p>"Mother of God prayserve us!" exclaimed Norah M'Haffety. "Is
there anny thruth in what ye're sayin'?"</p>

<p>"Jacob said to me, 'Where are the eyes of all you old married
women that you couldn't notice? Are you all asleep?'"</p>

<p>"But how could the like of that be thrue, and her with eyes for
none but Ronnie Dice, an' sure they'd have made a nice pair, but
what under the hivens has Larry but his ould hat?"</p>

<p>"Jacob says that old Larry done so well holdin' up old Jack
Stanton that young Larry thought there might be money in the same
sort of capers. Isn't it terrible, and Dot could have married
anyone.</p>

<p>"Now, who could be thinkin' out the wickedness of people. God
hilp us all with families of our own."</p>

<p>"We can be thankful we have them all reared and married."</p>

<p>"Our grandchildren aren't rared or all married yet&mdash;an' wan
of the Saunders! Afther that it would seem we were niver to be safe
till we're all in our graves buried and the tombstones rared upon
us and Masses bein' said for us, Rebecca!"</p>

<p>"It will be a terrible blow to them all, they so stuck-up. It
will bring them down a peg or two."</p>

<p>"Sure, wan gineration builds up and the other pulls down with
both hands; doesn't it seem as if that is what it was to be with
the ould families about here?"</p>

<p>"Don't say a thing to anyone or we might get into trouble."</p>

<p>"We can keep our mouths shut, we in public positions in the
town, but it's not sayin' we have to do the same with our ears and
eyes."</p>

<p>There was a tragedy ripe in the family of Tom Saunders, sen.,
eldest son of the old original. To certain families it does not
seem that certain classes of disgrace can appertain till one sad
morning there it is, in the same way that it might happen to the
most obvious sinner.</p>

<p>When Dot's fall became known to her family, old Tom horsewhipped
her and flung her out the door one night. Only her mother's
intervention saved her from being kicked while she was down, with
perhaps intensification of tragedy. Following that there had been
difficulty in preventing Dot, the gay and fearless rider, the
darling of many hearts, from doing away with herself. Her brother
and sister guarded her through the night. Mrs Saunders, wearing and
persistent, pointed out to her raging spouse that it was no help to
blare their disgrace to the whole district by casting the girl out.
Things were not yet beyond mending. Dot did not deny her paramour.
He could be made to marry her and if they set up out of the
district dates could be cloaked and matters patched.</p>

<p>Old Tom sent a letter to Larry Healey, jun., demanding his
appearance. This also was Mrs Saunders's counsel. Young Tom had
been for putting a bullet in Larry.</p>

<p>Contrary to expectations, Larry appeared at Saunders Plains
without delay. Old Saunders conducted him to the drawing-room for
the interview. Mrs Saunders and Tom were close at hand in case of
need, another brother guarded Dot and a sister saw that the one
maid who was in for the day was kept deep in blanket-washing and
spreading-out far up the orchard.</p>

<p>Neangen had gone up in the stirrups since the profitable
disposal of Aileen, and Larry was spruce and well turned out. He
had the address and fine features of his Uncle Dennis, the once
debonair and engaging. He could hardly believe what had resulted
from his intrepidity, but under the surface was quaking as he came
before old Tom, lean and austere. When old Tom looked at him, he so
boiled with rage that he could scarcely breathe, and had to clench
his hands to keep from lifting a heavy chair with murderous intent.
He could in that hour like a Spartan father have killed his
daughter for having brought this upon him.</p>

<p>"You know what I have brought you here for," he gulped.</p>

<p>"I can't say that I do," said Larry, off-handedly.</p>

<p>"By God, if you deny it, you bastard son of a lag."</p>

<p>"I didn't come here to be insulted," said Larry, getting to his
feet. "You're the son of a lag yourself, if all was known. I'll
stand no such aspersions against my mother who was as good a woman
as ever lived and of as good family, and it is for all to know."
This was true. His mother had been Sissy Gilbert of Maryville,
Monaro, and the Gilberts had the same standing in pioneer sets as
the Saunderses and Stantons.</p>

<p>"Yes, Pa, we have nothing to do with his mother," said young
Tom.</p>

<p>"If you will state your business civilly," said Larry.</p>

<p>"My daughter Dorothy," stammered the old man, the humiliation
more bitter than death. Larry said nothing. "There is no need for
me to say any more. You must do the straight thing at once."</p>

<p>"And what have I to do with your daughter Dorothy?" Larry had
felt exhilarated, riding along, to think of himself on one occasion
with Dot, when the Saunderses were so hoity-toity and snubbed his
sisters and himself.</p>

<p>"God, if you deny it, I'll leave you to my son, and you don't go
out of here alive."</p>

<p>Young Tom took up a loaded gun.</p>

<p>"So! You've trapped me like bushrangers in a lair and would
force me to make a decent woman of your &mdash;&mdash; of a
daughter to save my life. If I had known I was coming to such a den
I could have come armed too." Larry was well within the conventions
in the fine contempt he felt for Dot to have "lowered" herself.</p>

<p>"Have a care," said Tom, jun.</p>

<p>"Give him a chance," said the old man. "My daughter says you are
the man; do you admit it?"</p>

<p>"I admit I may have been one of them."</p>

<p>"Take that back, you swine, or you die," roared Tom, jun.,
levelling his piece. The younger man's ire had the effect of
control on his father.</p>

<p>"Now, this mud-slinging will help neither side. I think it will
be generally admitted that my daughter was not in any other man's
company."</p>

<p>"What about Ronald Dice? She made herself the talk of the
country with him, and he came bothering my sister to such an extent
that my father was compelled to shoot the horse under him as a
warning."</p>

<p>"You've been warned once," growled young Tom.</p>

<p>"Dice has left the district this two years and more. You'll stay
here under guard till matters are arranged," said old Tom.</p>

<p>"You needn't try to come the Tsar to such an extent," said
Larry, who was quite startled inwardly. "If I had any hand in
it&mdash;if Dot thinks I'm the principal one, I'm willing to marry
her for a consideration, but I have no means these hard times, and
don't want a woman and youngsters tied round my neck in
poverty."</p>

<p>They swallowed the insult and turned to terms. No thought of
what the girl was suffering occurred to them. An adult, she
deserved her punishment. All was proceeding without reference to a
wilful young woman whose suffering and shame were beyond endurance.
She could hear through the wooden walls all that was passing and
could not be restrained. Thrusting past her mother and brother she
appeared behind young Tom and seized his fowling-piece. Direct at
her betrayer she pointed, and pulled the trigger. Her brother had
the presence of mind to strike up her arm. Only an atrocious family
group above the mantelpiece was damaged. Larry, seeing the volcanic
determination in his fellow fallen-one's eyes, leapt to escape, but
old Tom got between him and the door. Young Torn was wrestling with
his sister against the discharge of the second barrel. His mother
came to his aid. Dot relinquished the gun and confronted Larry.</p>

<p>"You'd marry me, would you&mdash;for a consideration. You would,
would you! You'll never have the chance. I wouldn't marry you, not
if I was paid a thousand pounds a minute for the first year. You
were one of the men, were you, one of them! My God! It serves me
right! A thing like that, a miserable crawler that I wouldn't have
wiped my hoots on. It's no use of croaking and groaning to a
miserable nincompoop like you to patch things up. The thing is to
wipe them out so there is nothing left. I'll follow you, Larry
Healey, till I pot you, it doesn't matter where you run, I'll wait
if necessary&mdash;one bullet for you and another for me. That will
settle the score. I don't want judge or jury. I know the justice of
it. Another man!" she cried with bitter abandon. "Do you think if
there had been another man that I cared for that I would have...oh,
what is the good of talking! Marry me! I'd like to see you get the
chance. You can go. I'll wait my time&mdash;a bullet for you, no
argument about the rights of it with me."</p>

<p>Overcome with vertigo, Dot was taken away and laid upon her bed
by Mrs Saunders and Tom, jun. Mrs Saunders presently returned
seeking some medicament. "It is her condition," she took
opportunity of remarking to Larry. "It is to be expected. She will
be more reasonable later."</p>

<p>Larry was not comforted. He was inexperienced in the hysteria of
Dot's special condition. She had always been the upper spirit both
from natural characteristics and because of her more assured social
position. Her determined glare convinced Larry her purpose, and she
was a capable athletic girl who could reach any retreat possible to
him. Threats from his own sex might be discounted as fifty per cent
bluster, but the cold reality of female deadliness struck new
terror to Larry so that he would have abjectly apologized to old
Saunders and married Dot that afternoon had she been willing.</p>

<p>"If Dot feels so badly about it, I couldn't see her suffer so
terribly sorry for what's happened and what I said. I leave it to
you and her, but I warn you I haven't a stiver in the world," he
said with natural humanity and manliness.</p>

<p>Mrs Saunders reported later that Dot had gone into one faint
after another.</p>

<p>"It will most likely kill her," remarked old Saunders, hoping it
would.</p>

<p>"We'd better send for the doctor, or we may he in worse
trouble," said Tom, jun.</p>

<p>"No, we'll wait a while." Mrs Saunders wished to keep the affair
secret, and had had much experience of pregnancy in herself, her
daughters, and her neighbours.</p>

<p>Larry said he would wait too. "As soon as she is able, tell her
I don't want to distress her. I was always ready to do the right
thing by her, but having a gun held to my head without warning
raised my dander."</p>

<p>Old Saunders was a harder man than young Healey yet had time to
be or would ever be. He saw that Larry meant what he said. He
accepted his apology and sat with him on the veranda. Tom, jun.,
put Larry's horse in the stable. Mrs Healey let the serving girl
hear her explain that there had nearly been a terrible accident
through the gun going off accidentally and that it had given Miss
Dot such a turn that she was prostrated.</p>

<p>Midday dinner was a difficult meal for all. Mrs Saunders did not
appear, being in attendance upon Dot, and her other daughter
disappeared at intervals to reinforce her. In the afternoon Mrs
Saunders reported that Dot was much better. Larry's request for an
interview was granted. He found it particularly undermining to see
Dot pale and in bed&mdash;Dot always so tireless and vital.</p>

<p>"Dot, I'm sorry," he began. "But they held a gun to my head and
of course I wasn't going to sit clown under that without giving
better than they sent. Why didn't you let me know, yourself?"</p>

<p>Dot merely raised her head and spoke in a low voice that should
not carry to the household, but there was more cold fury in it than
in her earlier ultimatum, of which it was a reiteration.</p>

<p>"You'd marry me, would you? You'll never get the chance. The
taste I've had of disgrace is enough for me."</p>

<p>"There needn't be any disgrace. We could clear out to some place
where we're not known."</p>

<p>"You're <i>one</i> of the men, are you! You can't wipe that out,
you cur! No, I have given you fair warning. I don't care if it
takes till I'm eighty, I'll wipe the whole thing out."</p>

<p>"But Dot..." Mrs Saunders, hearing Dot's tones rising
deliriously, beckoned Larry to her.</p>

<p>"You must not excite her now. It's not safe. You must wait till
she is herself," she said soothingly. To have Larry eager to mend
the breach was such a relief that the trouble seemed almost over.
Dot was beside herself for the present, but she would simmer down.
Mrs Saunders felt herself in command of the situation.</p>

<p>"We'll send you word as soon as she is herself."</p>

<p>"Only let me know," said the contrite Larry, further brought to
his proper proportions by the rage in Dot's final glance as she
fixed it on him as he left her. The Saunderses had to let him
depart.</p>

<p>"Don't try to get out of the district," warned Tom, jun., "or I
shan't save you from a second shot. I'll tell the police to keep an
eye on you if you try any gerrymandering with me."</p>

<p>Larry, feeling as limp as chewed string, averred that no such
intention was his. The fury breathed by Dot, of whom he had thought
swaggeringly as his mere donah, was disintegrating.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>As the days passed and he received no summons he grew more and
more uneasy. He feared Dot behind every tree and heard her horse's
pursuing hoofs in each turn of the road. He was no seasoned
villain, but merely a bumptious yokel overwhelmed by a
conflagration he had by some hazard started. Another week passed
and he began to fear Dot would shoot him in his bed on a moonlit
night. He took to sleeping in odd places where he could not be
found, and as Saturday came said he would spend Sunday with Norah
and old Alf and take a couple of days' spell, for he was feeling so
off he believed he had a touch of the sun.</p>

<p>He found Alf and Norah in a depressed state of mind. They too
bad had a disappointment in the premature birth of a child some
little time before. Norah had been to Monaro for a rest with the
Timsons and Healeys and had consulted the famous Dr Brady of Cooma,
an oracle among the women. His opinion was that Mrs Alfred Timson
would never have another chance of motherhood. This was calamity to
the pair. Their breathless expectation of a child had been
touching. They were not beautiful, nor young, nor particularly
capable, nor ambitious, the simplest of folk, a child to them would
have been the apex of romance and fulfilment.</p>

<p>So real was their disappointment that Norah braved convention
and confided in Larry. As his catastrophe resulted from the
situation reversed, he blurted out, "Hell! Did you ever hear of
anything like that! I wish to God some others couldn't have a
child!"</p>

<p>Norah was so kind, Larry's distress so pressing, that he
confessed the mess he was in, how he was in terror of Dot being on
his tracks and that he really had come to Billy-go-Billy to hide
himself.</p>

<p>"A beautiful child to be born in sin and not wanted&mdash;the
misery of it, and my poor darling born dead!" breathed Norah.
"Glory be! Why should things happen so topsy-turvy? It would seem
that the Lord has made a mistake in this. Larry boy, tell me more
about it. Surely to God you would jump at the chance to marry a
fine young woman like Dot Saunders, the belle of the whole
district, and so much above us all. How did such a thing happen at
all? How could it be true?"</p>

<p>"God knows! I hardly could tell myself till it happened, and
then it couldn't be undone."</p>

<p>"But you could marry her at once and not wait a day."</p>

<p>"Damn it, ain't I telling you she won't have me at any price and
is going to shoot me. You bet she means it, too."</p>

<p>"The poor girl is distraught with the disgrace. Oh, Larry, if
only I could have had that baby. A little baby all my darling own,
how happy I should be&mdash;a blessing to me and a curse to that
other poor girl."</p>

<p>Norah's none too brilliant mind took hold of this idea, and
later she put forward a plan to Larry that shone like sunlight on
her large ungainly features. "Larry, I could help with that baby.
Couldn't Dot come here and I could pretend it was mine? She could
pretend she came to take care of me."</p>

<p>"Dot Saunders take care of you! Too thin! Some of these old
scandalmongers would see that sort of thing through a ten-inch
board, and how could Dot disguise herself," but he was touched by
the kindness.</p>

<p>Norah reapplied her mind. She took Alf into her confidence, and
laid their combined wisdom before Larry, the light of noble purpose
illuminating her. "Larry, I want you to take me to Bool Bool with
you at once to see Dot Saunders and her mother. Alf and I have
thought it all out. I'm not resting on Dr Brady's opinion, and I
want to consult Dr Byng."</p>

<p>"You can't do anything with Dot, I'm sure.</p>

<p>"You leave that to me. You never know where the blessing of God
may rest. He never shuts one door without opening another." Norah
had such confidence that Larry took hope and bent to her will. Alf
had already done so, and when morning came trembled like a child as
he saddled up; this, to the shyness bred of solitary sequestered
years, was a dangerous conspiracy, but Norah was shining with faith
and purpose.</p>

<p>"Not one word even to the folks at Neangen," she counselled. "Do
they know of your trouble, Larry?"</p>

<p>"It hasn't leaked out yet, but it soon will, if Dot stays mad."
Dot, by her wild intransigence, had put the big boot on her own
foot with a hardiness becoming the Baron Sir Robert Shurland, of
<i>Ingoldsby Legends</i>.</p>

<p>"Then God be praised for that! Not one word to anyone!"</p>

<p>Norah's stepmother was entirely deceived by the pilgrimage.
"Once you start going to doctors, you'll never stop," she observed.
"They'll take all your money and do no good. I'm sure I'd never
worry about not having children. The other way about is worse."</p>

<p>Larry said that he was feeling so "cronk" that he would consult
Dr Byng, too, so the three rode away from Neangen together to
Saunders Plains, Alf and Larry both dependent for courage upon
Norah. Mrs Saunders received her civilly enough and she unfolded
her simple proposal. Mrs Saunders stated that it had been necessary
to guard Dot night and day and they were at their wits' end. Dot
would not consent to see Norah, so Norah dispensed with consent and
went bravely to Dot, while certain family members stood to in case
of necessity. None arose.</p>

<p>They at times detected the sound of sobs and then murmuring
voices, and waited with mounting curiosity. Dot at first was hard
and bitter and not to be reached by any sister of Larry's,
certainly not by poor unbeautiful old Norah, whose love affair had
been a target of ribaldry for years, and whose failure in
motherhood also had been treated with less sympathy than ridicule.
But the warm sympathy, the first Dot had experienced since her
fall, melted the despair and hate in the distracted young woman,
and soon Norah had her in her arms.</p>

<p>"You must think of that beautiful little baby that is coming;
for its sake you must pray to keep calm and have a tranquil mind.
Larry is wild to marry you any moment."</p>

<p>At this Dot stiffened to vengefulness again.</p>

<p>"Well, then, never mind. He must take his punishment and be left
out of his share of the lovely little baby. I want you to give it
to me. You could trust it to me, couldn't you, dearie, and then if
it ever happened that you wanted it back..."</p>

<p>Dot was now near to sobs.</p>

<p>"You could trust it to me, couldn't you, dearie?" wheedled Norah
with wisdom generated in love.</p>

<p>Dot was shamed to recall how she had mimicked Norah on
horseback, sitting askew with the reins untidy as she get-upped her
stumbling old mare with a quince switch. The lowly Norah had
hitherto received little notice except as a butt for sharper wits,
yet came now to show a way from the suffering of weeks. Dot relaxed
into tears, as saving as rain on a drought-scorched plain.</p>

<p>"I could pad myself to deceive people," said Norah, fertile in
detail. "You can go away somewhere for a rest. This accident that
nearly happened with the gun has shaken your nerves. You could hide
at Billy-go-Billy. Winter is coming and Alf and I often don't see a
soul for weeks, and you'd be beautiful company for us."</p>

<p>When Norah rejoined the others, Dot was sleeping. It was a case
of any port to the family. After the last week or two with Dot they
were in no mind to cavil at the callow simplicity of the proposal.
Father and son were for brushing it aside, being suspicious of a
deep-laid plot to blackmail later on. Old Saunders was a
conventionally religious man as far as attendance at and support of
the church was concerned, but without any Christian charity. He was
all for marrying Dot to her betrayer by force, but Dot's violence
had crumpled him. Dot bashing herself to pieces as she threatened,
and as even her father did not doubt her capable of doing because
of his attitude, was a scandal he could not contemplate with
equanimity. He quailed before her frenzy, for his fear of having a
mad daughter was as terrible to him as the shame of an unvirtuous
one.</p>

<p>Mrs Saunders had no misgivings in risking blackmail, and
immediately embraced Norah's plan. Parting with money hurt old
Saunders second only to shame, but Mrs Saunders rose here too.
Norah was to be helped in every way if only she could bring Dot to
reason so that she would hush up the affair.</p>

<p>Dot would not consider Larry on any terms. Mention of him drove
her to phobia, so he was banished with a salutary sense of defeat
that cured his previous tendency to self-complacency in his
accidental conquest.</p>

<p>It was finally announced that Norah was going to Sydney to
consult a great man there about her case because Dr Byng had
reawakened her hopes. Her plan was to seek help of a convent of
which she had knowledge. She was sustained by Christian faith and
longed to be a church member again, but had been restrained so far
by the unrelenting enmity of her father.</p>

<p>Old Saunders raised his bristles upon the intrusion of creed,
but Mrs Saunders would not have balked at Voodooism, Mormonism, or
even cannibalism if thereby she could avert the overhanging
disgrace. The family were solidly behind her, so all that Tom,
sen., could do was to shut his mouth and open his purse.</p>

<p>Norah left amid the guffaws of the wits. She had a queer taste
to make such a fuss when the result might be another old Alf, like
a sleepy lizard. Norah, however, kissed him, and he was worth it.
He had entered upon the adventure with the enthusiasm of a child
and the fortitude in preserving the secret worthy of those who keep
their first big confidence as a shining trust.</p>

<p>Those that saw Alf putting Norah in the coach saw Dot Saunders
leaving too. Mrs Saunders told people she was going to have a
change in Sydney.</p>

<p>"Sure, Tommy Roper says she looked wretched," said Mrs
M'Haffety. "And she was takin' mighty little luggage with her, and
the last time whin she wint to ride before Lord Carrington there
was no ind of a fuss and airs with her own horse and saddle and
all."</p>

<p>"We'll wait a while and see," said Mrs Isaacs. "It will all come
out in the wash. There is something funny about that gun accident
that made Dot so sick. One person will hear something and another
see something and after a while the pieces will all fit
together."</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Norah's machinations progressed. Whatever had been the original
Healey's quarrel with the Church, and however bitterly the Church
had failed him, it did not fail Norah. The nuns were not
intransigent about her story of Dot's being so afraid of the sea
that she had to remain in Sydney while her husband was called to
England to see his dying mother. Norah provided a wedding ring and
settled Dot in lodgings recommended by the sisters. What these good
women thought of discrepancies in the story never transpired, they
were too charitable to scrutinize that side of the affair. Dot's
family were stated to be in New Zealand with the exception of her
Aunt Norah. The sisters regularly visited the young woman and
during indisposition nursed her. The absent husband was by
inference of the Catholic faith. Mrs Saunders saw that funds were
forthcoming. Norah's demands were moderate.</p>

<p>After two months Norah returned to Billy-go-Billy, radiant, and
the knowing whispered that the Sydney doctor had been efficacious.
Jokes about Alf Timson's approaching fatherhood were popular. The
kinder smothered Norah with advice about being careful this time,
and for the remainder, it was winter and few people visited
Billy-go-Billy.</p>

<p>Dot Saunders was a long time absent and people threw out leading
questions about possible attractions. Mrs Saunders was hazy. She
said that she was anxious about Dot's health; all that riding over
hurdles was not good for a girl. Later, people heard that Dot had
been ordered to Brisbane for the sea trip. The subject slept.</p>

<p>One piece of news as the year drew to a close was that Mrs Alf
Timson had gone to Sydney again to be near her wonder-working
specialist for the great event. People wondered where old Alf got
all the money for this.</p>

<p>"He's had a good nest-egg salted down somewhere," observed Tommy
Roper over M'Haffety's bar. "He's always been one of those safe
sawney old chaps; never has a spree or goes in for any
money-wasting antics."</p>

<p>In time Mrs Alf returned, and went direct to Billy-go-Billy
without delay in town. The few who saw the baby said it was very
big for its age. It was a great success. Alf was for some time
afraid to touch it. He could only gaze amazedly.</p>

<p>"She's so lovely," breathed the worshipful Norah. "I'm afraid
they'll be wanting her from us."</p>

<p>Kind as ever, she had wanted the name to be Dorothy, but feared
this might be a pointer. Dot, however, with a spark of the right
spirit, said the child's sole and only name should be Norah, after
the only person in all the world who had wanted her and welcomed
her.</p>

<p>"And Alfred," said Norah. "He wants her as much as I do, and he
dotes on children. If ever there was a dear, good, kind husband, it
is my Alfred."</p>

<p>"Then her name is Norah Alfreda," amended Dot.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p>The year that Milly returned from school Lucy Saunders came up
from Turrill Turrill some weeks before Christmas with the intention
of putting in her time about Bool Bool. She could not endure the
heat at Turrill Turrill and did not enjoy Ten Creeks now that she
was no longer mistress there.</p>

<p>"I cannot stomach that Healey crowd," she complained to her
sister-in-law, Maud. "I don't care how much we are connected with
them, it doesn't make them any more palatable to me."</p>

<p>Neither Norah nor Joanna was seen much at Ten Creeks now, but
Julie in her eighteenth year, a gossiping deceitful girl with whom
no secrets were safe, was much more offensive.</p>

<p>SP-over-J, happening to be in Bool Bool, went to meet his niece
as she got out of Prendergast's coach, and said, "Well, Milly, are
you coming to Ten Creeks? You can come straight up with me now if
you like. Your Aunt Aileen hasn't anyone to keep her company, only
the servants. I think I'll be able to find you a horse or two worth
riding." Stanton was cordial. Milly had retained his goodwill since
the marriage.</p>

<p>"How is Auntie now?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't be better. That Melbourne doctor did wonders. A couple
of weeks under him was worth all those other quacks put
together."</p>

<p>"I'm dying to see the baby."</p>

<p>"He's a great chatterbox."</p>

<p>"I must teach him to ride before he is too old. I'll go up with
you now if Mother will let me."</p>

<p>Mother proved amenable because Julie was kept at Neangen to
attend her mother, who was ailing. Milly then said, "Say, Uncle
Jack, let's telegraph for Uncle Bert to spend Christmas with us. He
need not stay at Curradoobidgee for it now that his stepmother is
dead." This was also agreed, and Milly sent a long telegram before
leaving Bool Bool next morning. They travelled by buggy-and-four to
take Milly's portmanteaux, and halted for the midday meal with Dan
Spires and Joanna at Wamgambril Springs.</p>

<p>"Who's in Goraig Flats now?" asked Milly. "I saw fowls about and
a woman's washing on the line."</p>

<p>"Ronald Dice is managing there this summer for the Macfarlanes
of Quondong."</p>

<p>"Is he married?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. One of the girls is with him."</p>

<p>"Then you be sure to tell him to come and see me," said Milly in
her old frank way. "I haven't seen him since Uncle Jack's wedding."
She was unconscious that this might be delicate ground.</p>

<p>"I expect you'll have droves of spoons after you now that you've
grown into such a swell young lady," said the amiable Dan. "I'll
get old Bill Heffernan to lay baits for them," said Uncle Jack. He
was almost genial with this niece.</p>

<p>Milly found her aunt's careworn listless look replaced by full
cheeks and well-being. The baby was now two years off, as the Ten
Creeks people put it, a merry toddler named Lawrence John after his
father and grandfather, and a pet with all. He was guarded by a
grey mongrel called Towser, one of the progeny of old Bessie, the
ancient nurse dog at Neangen. There was no danger of Lawrence's
straying into the bush while Towser was about. He had wondrous
patience with all small things. Strangers and adults bored him, but
the baby could fall all over him, take his bone from him and poke
things in his mouth and ears to Towser's fatuous content. Larry had
carried him over as a puppy just after Aileen's return from the
honeymoon. Mrs Healey insisted upon this guardian, because but for
one of Towser's forebears she would have lost Aileen when a baby,
and Mrs Bob Milford, over the river, likewise would never be
without a canine guardian, for her eldest brother had been lost at
the age of three, and never a trace of him again from that day to
this.</p>

<p>Milly reached Ten Creeks on a Wednesday, and owing to the
telepathic way news spread, there was by Saturday night a full
house in her honour. There were Cross-eyed Prendergast and Billings
from Gundagai, who had seen the coach come in and suddenly
bethought it a good spec to pick up a few colts. There were a young
Mazere and Alistair Farquharson. Milly would have attributed
Alistair's visit to chance but that he brought a special present.
He confessed that lie had run into Cuppinbingle Potter in Yass on
Thursday. Potter had mentioned travelling from Goulburn with the
little girl from Ten Creeks and that she was the likeliest filly he
had seen for years. Trust old Cuppinbingle interest in every mare
or maid of promise or performance!</p>

<p>Years before at the muster Alistair had been sufficiently
attracted to tease Milly, and later had been the one to take charge
of the cremation of Romp's remains. He had been so touched by her
owner's grief that he saved one of the hoofs and had it mounted as
an ink-pot with silver finish and shoe.</p>

<p>The person who seemed to find most patent pleasure in reunion
was Ronald Dice, who came over with his sister in response to the
message delivered by Dan Spires, and was so firmly pressed by Milly
to stay the night that Aileen added her formal invitation.
SP-over-J was compelled to murmur his too because Milly was the
centre of attraction and hanging on his arm affectionately. She was
the only niece of the liberal broods who would have thought of
swinging on SP-over-J's arm. It clinched her popularity. She
clearly had never looked upon him as an ogre, who had taken Aileen
from her young lover by unparliamentary measures, an attitude
grateful to him. In the glow of it, and as victor, he could manage
to be outwardly civil to Dice though he did not forget being called
to his face a death adder, a dried-up old hide, etc. Stanton was at
ease since the Melbourne physician had restored Aileen. It was a
pleasure to look at her these days with health and colour glowing
in her cheeks after two years of exasperation because she looked
like a wilting martyr.</p>

<p>After dinner when the lamps were alight and dancing on the
veranda was started, Alistair Farquharson produced his offering and
presented it to Milly in the shadow of the raspberry canes at the
bottom of the garden. Her eyes filled as she exclaimed in her
wholehearted, unaffected manner, "That is so kind of you, Mr
Farquharson. Will you please not mind if I don't open it at once. I
want to keep it till I am quite alone."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Milly, and I hope you will like it well enough not
to call me 'mister' in that stiff way. You make me feel as old as
Mr Potter."</p>

<p>"I'd like to call you Alistair; it is such a pretty name," she
responded, flitting away to deposit her parcel, unconscious of the
thrill she left with its donor. Returning, she rewarded him with a
long dance, a creature to enthral a man in her rosebud maidenhood,
polished by Miss Lisset and decked in a fashionable dancing frock
of accordion pleats with a sash outlining her dainty waist, and
wide frills of fairy lace at neck and elbows. But then she went to
Dice's arms with noticeable alacrity and Alistair stood in the
shade of a rose-bush and watched their every movement. Ronald was
exercising all the old charm that Milly had found in him when she
was in knee skirts and had championed his cause with Aileen, only
later returning clannishly to her uncle because he had been called
reptilian names. She was much enjoying being grown
up&mdash;almost&mdash;and back on Ten Creeks Run with the
horses.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Potter of Cuppinbingle and his neighbour of Keba shared a room
that night, and since it was on the veranda outside the
drawing-room they were safe to converse.</p>

<p>"The little jam-puff will have 'em all left at the post before
another year is past, I'll make you a bet on it."</p>

<p>"Do you think so," responded Farquharson, so interested that he
was self-conscious.</p>

<p>"I'm flaming well sure. A pity she has eyes only for that Dice,
and he's running strong with the Missus."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was all over long ago."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it! She's not the sort to close a thing&mdash;no
ballast there. She fixes her eyes on Dice like a hungry dog on a
bone and never takes 'em off. I wonder what old SP-over-J thinks of
it. If I'd cornered a young woman with me money and she looked at
the fellow I ousted like that, I'd want a padlock and chain on
her."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Milly will take his mind off."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it! He's only using the girl as a cavalry
screen."</p>

<p>Farquharson was encouraged to hear this, but at the same time
longed to punch Dice's head. "Someone ought to give old Skinny a
hint."</p>

<p>"Nice job that would be! If a man can't look after that sort of
affair himself, he deserves all he gets." Rumour was that husbands
more than one had what they may not have deserved via the audacity
and fascinations of Cuppinbingle Potter.</p>

<p>"Now, if I were your age, Alistair, I'd give Dice a run for his
money. There's that Larry Healey got an evil eye on her too.
Larry's a taking obliging devil, mind you; he's never a sour-guts,
and if he got out a little would make a topping fellow, but in
connection with the filly I wouldn't use him for dingo baits. If
Tommy Roper is correct he carried on over the odds with Dot
Saunders."</p>

<p>"Dot Saunders is not that sort. She's a high flyer and has been
away out of the district for ages. Tommy Roper often knows more
than really happens."</p>

<p>"I've generally found there's a good deal of fire under his
smoke."</p>

<p>"I haven't been talking to Tommy since he started off to
Queensland on that droving expedition with Flash Billy."</p>

<p>"That soon blew out. They had the devil of a shindy according to
old Mick Muldoon."</p>

<p>"What became of Billy?"</p>

<p>"According to Tommy, he got in with a circus and does trick
training with horses. That was Billy's downfall here, taught the
best colts tricks in hopes they would be sold as outlaws. Poole
blew out his little game there with Corroboree." Ensued talk of
Corroboree and his form at Randwick and Flemington, for which he
had been prepared by the Cuppinbingle trainers.</p>

<p>Other chat proceeded in other apartments. Stanton had to dismiss
Towser from the cot of Lawrence John. The dog was forbidden the
house because of fleas, but was so faithful that it was difficult
to exclude him, and excluded he had excavated like a wombat to lie
under the flooring beneath his charge.</p>

<p>"Poor old chappie, I hate to see him turned out," said Aileen.
"We'll never lose the baby while Towser is on guard."</p>

<p>Milly had to share her room with Ida Dice. They conversed
volubly as they undressed, but in cautious whispers. The slab walls
afforded no protection against eavesdroppers, and there were
popular ribaldries abroad of what women had heard from men's rooms
and vice versa. Milly wanted to talk of Ronald, a dull subject to
his sister; Ida to hear of Cuppinbingle, who by his address and
assurance in well-worn innuendoes could banish dullness from the
ladies. Milly was eager to look at her present, and as soon as Ida
was settled, stole out to the sitting-room. When the article was
free from its wrappings, the tears at first blinded her, but when
they were wiped away she was startled.</p>

<p>This was not Romp's hoof. It was too big.</p>

<p>Milly had a natural gift for the points of a horse&mdash;points
that can neither be taught nor expressed, but which have to be felt
by a kind of sixth sense. A wild hope came to her. Then doubts. In
the fitting and curing the hoof might have been enlarged or
squeezed out of shape: or the hoofs might have been destroyed and
Alistair, meaning well, have substituted.</p>

<p>She spoke with him next morning. "You were most kind to go to so
much trouble about that lovely ink-pot...The hoof looks so big and
different, I should not have known it. Are you sure the jeweller
gave you hack the right one?"</p>

<p>"There could be no doubt about that."</p>

<p>"You are sure it is Romp's hoof?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure. I went out to the Corroboree rings myself the very
next day and attended to things as I promised."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it looks different from what I expected done up that
way. You won't mind if I don't let anyone see it for a while."</p>

<p>"Not at all." Alistair liked to think of her treasuring it
secretly. While breakfast was impending Milly wrote a letter.</p>

<blockquote>Darling Uncle Bert,<br>
<br>
Alistair Farquharson has brought me one of Romp's hoofs set as an
inkstand, and it is not Romp's hoof at all. Alistair is certain, he
says, that it is the hoof of the blue roan that broke its neck over
the precipice. If this is so, the horse that was found dead is not
Romp at all, and she is still alive somewhere. I am so excited. I
could not be deceived in Romp's off-front hoof. It was small and
double-banded and wide at the heel and smooth as a bottle. This
bulges a bit like a cask that is going to burst the hoops. I am
writing to you at once as you said if ever I wanted you to let you
know. Even if you weren't coming for Christmas you will come and
see as soon as possible about this, won't you? I don't think we
should delay, do you?</blockquote>

<p>This was entrusted to Farquharson to post when he left on Sunday
night.</p>

<p>So important did Poole consider the missive because of Milly's
acumen that he demolished the rough miles between Curradoobidgee
and Ten Creeks several days before he had intended to set out for
Christmas.</p>

<p>Milly had been sure of his response. She was enjoying the
ascendancy known to an attractive maid where pioneering left men so
natural that she had only to say to one man go, and to another
come, and off they went tantivy with knightly willingness, being so
placed that they had the horse-flesh and could make the time. Milly
accepted all such service as unselfconsciously as the numbers of
spirited horses and her skill in backing them, her knowledge of the
ranges with the glorious sunlight and air above, the hundreds of
square miles of streams and trees gay with gyang-gyangs and
cockatoos, parrots and magpies, satin-birds ( bower-birds ),
lyre-birds, blue tits, and a hundred other species; and down below,
the wallabies, wombats, kangaroos, goannas, lizards, and the
occasional excitement of a snake.</p>

<p>The tall quiet man who had just reached the sixties was pleased
by the prospect of seeing something of his young friend. Still
strong, lithe, lean, and full of experience, but retaining
simplicity of heart, he could hold his own with many that were only
half his age. His hair showed but little grey, he had escaped
baldness and a broken mouth, and his clear brown eyes still looked
serenely and gallantly on life and found it good.</p>

<p>The men were out on the run when Poole arrived, but Milly had
stayed in expecting him. Towser being assured that Poole had no
evil design on the heir, and other preliminaries past, Milly
brought out the hoof. One look satisfied Poole that it was not
Romp's. It had carried more shoes than Romp at the date of her
supposed passing had had time to do; it had suffered from an
unskilled smithy, whereas Poole had shod Romp himself as a very
special beast.</p>

<p>"That never carried the Young Whisker filly or any other beast
bred between Cuppinbingle and Curradoobidgee," was his
pronouncement.</p>

<p>"Then Romp is still alive! That was another horse fell over the
ledge." Milly was all excitement.</p>

<p>"If we could be sure that this is the hoof of the Gyang Gyang
corpse we could establish the first fact. Blue roans are not
common. I have never seen another of Romp's size in the Southern
District."</p>

<p>"Didn't you look at the dead horse when it was found?"</p>

<p>"You've caught me napping. The beast was in such an unholy mess
in the mud and slush that her hoofs were out of sight. I was
deceived by her general size and the mane and tail, and the pieces
of hide remaining were blue roan, and I was working on the theory
that she would probably make back to Mount Corroboree."</p>

<p>"Didn't you look at the hoofs?"</p>

<p>"Stupid of me! I looked for the brand, but the near-side
shoulder was bare to the bone."</p>

<p>"Alistair Farquharson swore on his honour that this hoof came
from that beast and that the jeweller could not substitute it. I
knew all along that Romp was never fool enough to fall over a
precipice. How did she get away from Curradoobidgee? She never
tried when I had her up there."</p>

<p>"You'll remember I told you she was trying to get away from
Three Rivers the night of the bridge opening."</p>

<p>"So Flash Billy said. I bet he has taken her away and done
something with her."</p>

<p>"Now, you mustn't go on a theory without facts, that's what I
did trying to find the filly at Mount Corroboree, and you see how I
got fooled."</p>

<p>"We must start somewhere. Find out where Billy is and watch him
to see if he still has Romp. I don't think he could bear to part
with her. It can't do him any harm so long as we say nothing till
we are sure. We'll have it as a secret like we did when we ran
things when I was little. It makes me feel scrumptiously young
again."</p>

<p>It suddenly made Poole feel abominably old&mdash;<i>old</i>! He
would need to watch himself lest he decline into senile folly worse
than old Jack's.</p>

<p>"I could get the police to find the whereabouts of Billy, could
pretend I wanted him for his advantage, so that it would not arouse
unjust suspicions about him." This was agreed upon, and Poole
turned to other topics.</p>

<p>"You must come and keep me company at Curradoobidgee as soon as
Aunt Aileen can spare you," he said at dinner. "I could get some of
the nieces over when you come."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is not necessary. I'll come and housekeep for you now
that dear old Mrs Poole is dead."</p>

<p>Poole wondered was Milly still a child in innocence, or had she
put him in the complete uncle class.</p>

<p>Mrs Lucy Saunders, hearing that Poole was at Ten Creeks, arrived
there for a visit on Boxing Day, but though she suggested it, she
got no invitation to Curradoobidgee, and Poole returned there a day
or two earlier than he would otherwise have done. When Milly turned
her face up in the old childish way for a kiss, he affected not to
see and attained his horse before saying goodbye, feeling depressed
to be so obviously an uncle.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>At that date on Monaro, operating from Braminderra, was a smart
young trooper in whose hands Poole placed the matter of tracing
Billy Bowes. Shortly after New Year he was informed that when last
heard of Bowes had joined Sparr and Leamington's Circus, which
travelled all over Australia, in full strength in the cities and
divided for the small towns. Bowes was in the division that
operated in Victoria. Further information was a roster of the
horses employed in the ring by Sparr and Leamington, with brands
and ages as far as practicable. Asked confidently what class of
horse was sought, Poole narrowed it to galloways, red or blue
roans.</p>

<p>In due time Constable Purkis reported that the only horses of
such a description were a red roan in the New South Wales branch,
and a blue roan five years off with a blotched brand, white hind
foot, and star, in the Victorian branch.</p>

<p>The star and white hind foot were misleading, for Romp had no
white spot. Constable Purkis supplied a country paper in which was
a story of the clever circus pony that could buck herself out of
every piece of tackle without breaking or straining a buckle.</p>

<p>"I knew," said Milly.</p>

<p>"Still, it is only circumstantial evidence," said Uncle Bert.
"Billy trained your filly to that trick, he could train
another."</p>

<p>"He could train any donkey mongrel to buck, but he could not
find another so clever as to get out of everything like a conjuror.
Will you take me to that circus to look at that pony?"</p>

<p>"But it's away in Victoria and they might hear of us
coming."</p>

<p>"We needn't let anyone know we were going. We could just slip
off together quietly."</p>

<p>"Then we should be in the soup! People would think I had..." He
was going to say "unlawfully abducted you," but on the brink he
substituted "that we were murdered, and all the papers would
advertise it. Instead of secrecy we should have the whole bally
country buzzing."</p>

<p>"I suppose we might have to tell Mother and Uncle Jack what we
were off to do, and then it would be all right."</p>

<p>Poole took refuge in the need for secrecy and agreed to think
out a plan.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p>It was a lively year for Ten Creeks Run. Aileen, well and happy,
and the baby at a most interesting age, were staple attractions
where men outnumbered women, and there were occasional visits from
Milly's school friends. Above all there was Milly, and there was
not a foot-loose man of any age who would have thought forty or
fifty miles on Saturday afternoon and again on Sunday night, or the
prevailing financial stringency an insuperable barrier to spending
a few hours within sight and sound of her. The Mesdames Milford,
too, over the river, enjoyed visits from one station to the other
a-horseback.</p>

<p>Among the men that swarmed in Milly's direction certain persons
stood out as of definite intention. These were Alistair
Farquharson, Potter, a young Stanton from Mungee, Matt Dice as well
as Ronald, and Oliver Brennan from The Gap. There was also Beverley
Dash, a surveyor new to the district, and the hopeless slave Ted
Billings, now overseer in place of Dan Spires. Some of these
brought women with them occasionally.</p>

<p>Of the crowd, Ronald Dice was the most envied, for it was plain
that he was Milly's favourite; but hope would die in none of them
until Milly should be disposed of. To keep an eye on Milly,
ostensibly, her mother was frequently at Ten Creeks that summer.
Aileen let her manage to her heart's content. If any woman could
not agree with Aileen, the fault would not be Aileen 's bossiness,
and Lucy wanted to be at Ten Creeks, so made herself more agreeable
than when she had been missus-in-chief.</p>

<p>Poole began to find the distance between Monaro and the lower
Coolgarbilli so insignificant that he, too, thought nothing of
dropping in to spend Sunday, and, since he was not pressed for
time, often arrived on Friday and did not depart till Tuesday.</p>

<p>"There's fresh talk of a match between Mrs Lucy Saunders and
Curradoobidgee," said Mrs Isaacs in her back parlour.</p>

<p>"He'll be dhruv to marry someone now that he's on his lone."</p>

<p>"Yes, an' Lucy bein' put out of her nest, will be more desperate
in her attacks."</p>

<p>"'Twould be very suitable. He's a quiet man an' used to a
managing woman raging about, an' well able to affoord a wife, an'
it's better dacincy to the dead&mdash;meanin' poor Emily Mazere who
was drownded&mdash;than for him to be runnin round afther some
young thing like ould Stanton did."</p>

<p>"But that's turned out very happily now. Aileen is looking bonny
and her boy is a beauty. That last doctor in Melbourne fixed her up
completely."</p>

<p>"Marriages for property are jinrilly always more sinsible in the
end. There could have been no thruth in half the talk. Ronald Dice,
I hear now, is just wild afther Milly, an' she is favourin'
him."</p>

<p>"She's only a girl yet. Her mother I hear means to take her to
Sydney for a season when she is eighteen."</p>

<p>"She's comin' on, an' she'll have to marry. They haven't more
than a penny without, an' if her mother doesn't look out she'll be
takin' up with some of these scrubbers before she comes out in
Sydney. Ida and Olive is always over there too thryin' to pick up
something in the crowd."</p>

<p>"Well, if old Joanna and Norah got off, the Dice girls should
stand a better chance; they're good-looking."</p>

<p>"Ah, but they're waitin' for something more profitable than
they'll catch in the ind."</p>

<p>Lucy Saunders had a similar idea one pleasant Saturday afternoon
at Ten Creeks. "I think some raspberries would be nice for supper,"
she suggested to Poole, who had arrived while Milly, Aileen, Ida
Dice, and Flora Farquharson had gone for a bogey.</p>

<p>"I hope they are in a safe place," Poole had observed. Lucy
recalled that his uneasiness was reminiscent of the fatal Saturday
afternoon long ago when his bride-to-be had been drowned. She did
not allow his thoughts to linger in such a channel.</p>

<p>"They've gone to that place where the water is drawn from, more
danger of getting bruised on the boulders than being drowned there.
Some of the men have gone to the Slate Hole to shoot ducks. Our
only hope of distinguishing ourselves is with the raspberries. If
you'll hold the billy, I'll pick."</p>

<p>Soon they were busy among the canes. "I see Potter and Alistair
just dropping in," observed Mrs Saunders.</p>

<p>"Farquharson has it awful bad. You'll soon be losing Milly if
you don't look out."</p>

<p>"Oh, she's only a tomboy yet. Now is the time I miss her father.
I do need someone to help me guide her, someone who would
understand her."</p>

<p>"Milly is a ripping youngster. She has lots of solid ballast in
that head of hers."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I do feel the need of a man to guide her."</p>

<p>"There's not much in the present crowd to pick from." He looked
away at the hills over the Coolgarbilli, glorious under the sinking
sun, wondering where was the man good enough for Milly. "Reckon
he's never been foaled," he chunnered.</p>

<p>"She seems taken up with Ron Dice for the present."</p>

<p>"That's not half good enough. A fellow that was making such a
noise about Aileen two or three years ago is not steady enough for
Milly. Matt is steadier, but as poor as a church-mouse, and not
much head for getting on."</p>

<p>"Oliver Brennan has joined the throng lately."</p>

<p>"He is the best of the boiling, but the religion is the trouble
there."</p>

<p>"Yes...Larry seemed infatuated at the start, but he's never here
now, thank goodness. I don't want any more of the Healeys."</p>

<p>"Larry, mind you, is a taking fellow in his
way&mdash;good-looking, and a great rider. If only he had a chance
he would make a fine man, but in connection with Milly, he's not to
be considered. He and Dot were for ever together till she went
away, but she's well able to look out for herself."</p>

<p>"I should hope so. It's to be hoped she picks up something
better than Larry while she is away."</p>

<p>"Girls like Dot often pick the crooked stick."</p>

<p>"She used to be all eyes for Ron Dice, but he did not seem to
respond."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that's why she turned to Larry."</p>

<p>"Financially and socially, of course, Donald Potter has a
position that none of the others can touch, and he's foolishly
infatuated."</p>

<p>"But good heavens, Lucy! You wouldn't mention him in the same
breath with Milly! He's old enough to be her father, and apart from
that no fit associate for an innocent girl."</p>

<p>It relieved Mrs Saunders to hear Poole condemning as fatherly,
in connection with Milly, one who was nearly twenty years his own
junior.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is fatherly ideas he has."</p>

<p>"You should encourage him, then," said Poole, with his serene
smile. "Cuppinbingle is a topping place, he has heaps of money, is
a jolly fellow and no end of a nob&mdash;just right for a woman of
experience."</p>

<p>"Too jolly for my taste. Money doesn't attract me like good
qualities. I should like a congenial companion. If Milly marries I
shall be desperately lonely. Don't you feel lonely too, especially
since yiur dear old stepmother died?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes, but I'll have to put up with it. The women all gave
me the go-by for someone else."</p>

<p>"You can't have asked the right one. You should try again." She
looked at him with an encouraging laugh, but he said the billy was
full and he had better go for another vessel, and turned away
noting that Jerry Riddall was penning the fat calves, and Long
Billy hitching old Flea Creek to the water-slide to go down where
Milly was swimming, so she must soon appear now. He was shot with
delight by the thought of plunging with Milly in the cool of the
evening, while the rocks were still warm, in the river pools banked
with maidenhair, mint, and mimulus, and heavenly with the scent of
tea-tree and heath, with the agile water goannas lifting their
tails like an old lady her skirts and scampering away&mdash;but
that he could never do in this world. Men and women did not clip
together unless indecent, or man and wife, and Milly was decent as
the dawn, and he was over sixty and she only seventeen.</p>

<p>There was Saturday night discussion in the hut. Old Heffernan
had come in from Wamgambril and he had an instinct for news
rivalling Mrs Isaacs's, with the added tang of malice.</p>

<p>"Ole Lucy got the Curradoobidgee blackfellow copped yet?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"Nope," said Long Billy Riddall. "If you ask me, the ole cove is
as dead shook on young Milly as any of the young 'uns."</p>

<p>"An' he's jist as likely to be in the runnin'."</p>

<p>"Not he. She's dead shook on Ron Dice. Allers was, when she was
in pigtails, an' before he got sloppy about the Missus."</p>

<p>"Sloppier than ever now, ain't he?"</p>

<p>"Garn! I don't think so."</p>

<p>"Don't be a &mdash;&mdash; mopoke. That's what cured her. They
went to Melbourne together that time they reckoned the new doctor
done miracles. Tommy Roper had it from a feller&mdash;you know,
Jerry Porter, Tim's brother. He was workin' on Turrill Turrill, an'
left&mdash;got a job truckin' some fats that Dice was in charge of,
to Melbourne; an' you oughter know, Billy Riddall, your own
brother, is guard on that train, an' he told Jerry Porter, an' he
told Tim and Tommy. He reckons if ole Skinny Guts
knew...well..."</p>

<p>"Garn! You're makin' it up," said Jerry Riddall. "He never told
me.</p>

<p>"Musta forgot. You don't know you're born yet."</p>

<p>"Rared onder a hin'," contributed Long Billy.</p>

<p>"Yes, Dice is only makin' a blind of the young 'un. Ask Jane
Humphreys, she's seen 'em kissin' an' muggin like a house on
fire."</p>

<p>"Seen who kissin' and muggin'?"</p>

<p>"Dice and the Missus, of course."</p>

<p>"Gam! You're makin' it up."</p>

<p>"All right! How much will you bet me? Did I make it up about ole
Skinny? Who seen him goin' off the hooks first?"</p>

<p>Heffernan, prevented by environment from indulgence in illicit
life beyond getting the better of his fellows in petty ways or an
occasional alcoholic debauch, found peculiar zest in contemplating
all likely deviations from virtue or honesty.</p>

<p>"Well, if that's true, I'll &mdash;&mdash; well eat me hat!"
said Long Billy, meaning to keep his eyes open in future. Old
Heffernan was a knowing old cockatoo, take him all in all.</p>

<p>Family scandals were then eclipsed by the tales of Red Joe, the
surveyor's link man, who had arrived with his master in time for
the evening meal. These were all of shooting blacks in Queensland,
and of the virility in handling the gins afterwards, splendid
red-blooded tales to tickle the ears of real men of the mettle
which makes mighty soldiers or lovers.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>The summer slipped past, perfumed and cool by the singing
Coolgarbilli and its creeks, draped in ferns and foliage where the
gyang-gyangs and other parrots decorated the tree-tops. As March
shortened the days and brought a nip to the nights, the movement of
stock down the Murrumbidgee should have begun, but there was no
profit in shifting livestock about for their health that season. It
was a dreadful year of strikes and soup-kitchens. Abundant seasons
and over-production coupled with the maldistribution inseparable
from the civilized world's system of economics had that spring
culminated in one of the recurrent financial panics of the
generation. It was impossible to realize more than a shilling or
eighteenpence per head for fat wethers, and it cost more to truck
them to Homebush than was procurable for them. Inferior stock could
not be given away. Boiling-down came into fashion again. Money was
scarce. Breaking banks and bankruptcies were common, and people had
other preoccupations than moving from place to place for the
climate.</p>

<p>The Isaacses, for example, had their hands full in standing to
the district with liberal credit till money should circulate again,
and dispensed it with a friendly generosity that gave them first
place with the old inhabitants till the end of their days.</p>

<p>In the circumstances Stanton decided to leave a good deal of
stock to take their chance in the mountains, and suggested
remaining there himself with his family to see that dingo-hunting
was not neglected. Aileen assented willingly. Ten Creeks was no
lonelier or colder than Jinninjinninbong, where the Milford women
staved winter and summer, having no other holdings to shift to,
also Aileen had been informed by Dice that the Macfarlanes were to
leave some sheep at Goraig with himself in charge.</p>

<p>The days were short and bleak in the valley of the Coolgarbilli,
from which the sun departed early over the high wild ranges back of
Corroboree, and on many a southerly sideling the frost and
upstanding icicles rarely melted. The station-hands shot a heavy
harvest of possums and wallaroos for their winter pelts from which
to make the great rugs in which they curled o' nights and slept
like the blest. Visitors disappeared from Ten Creeks and
Jinninjinninbong. SP-over-J was called to Turrill Turrill, for
there was disease in the Riverina flocks. Lucy was there to
housekeep; Milly kept Aileen company at Ten Creeks. Milly preferred
Ten Creeks and Bool Bool to Riverina, and that winter Ronald was an
additional magnet. None to her had his charm.</p>

<p>A dozen men could appear armed with valentines or packets of
bull's-eyes, or jujubes or sugared almonds or Scottish mixtures, or
gorgeous work-boxes, or scrap-books, or a riding whip, or a saddle
cloth, or a carved quandong, or any other current bait, and Milly
might be gracious or indifferent, but Ronald's voice penetrated and
thrilled immediately among a score of others. The turn of his head
lent romance to the day; a banal joke from his lips was convulsing.
Why? Milly could not have said.</p>

<p>This was plain to Ronald, though for a time he thought of her
only as one of the little girl sweethearts that have sweetened the
way of all kindly, cleanly young men of virile charm in the bush.
It was Aileen who became aware of Milly's more adult emotions, and
was uneasy lest she should lose her own kingdom till she recognized
in Milly the requisite subterfuge.</p>

<p>Ronald greeted Milly with whole-hearted cordiality when he came
and was guarded with Aileen, and for further example he was so
unrestive and agreeable in the company of Lucy Saunders that she
could not suspect there might be another at hand for whom he pined.
Even Jane Humphreys felt while Mr Dice talked to her that she was a
charming wench and had as good a chance as the ladies of being in
the running.</p>

<p>When Ronald appeared on Saturday evenings to spend Sundays, it
was Milly who met him and who could be heard laughing with him and
arranging to try his horse, whereas Aileen sometimes did not appear
till the evening meal. He always brought two offerings, whether of
sweets or ornamental scraps, which pleased Milly, for the
"gooseberry" in her day shared in such spoils equally with the rose
herself. For the same reason Aiken did not begrudge Milly her
perquisites.</p>

<p>Ronald came one afternoon in June with the depressing news that
his employers had decided to take the stock out of the
mountains.</p>

<p>"My goodness, Aunt Aileen, Ronald says he has only come to say
good-bye. Isn't he mean to desert us? Won't it be dull?" Milly was
frankly downcast at the prospect of his departure, but immediately
thought of letters as the next and more progressive stage. She was
not looking at Aileen or she would have seen her face paling.
Ronald, looking over Milly's head, was touched to tenderness and
complacency.</p>

<p>SP-over-J was at Turrill Turrill. Ronald and the overseer were
the only men among the inside family that week-end. There had been
snow on the hills. Mount Corroboree had a white cap and the
Jinninjinninbong ranges, reflecting the setting sun, looked like
iced Christmas cakes, which made it cosy beside the music and heat
of the great log fires. Aileen wished to be rid of Milly, but the
attraction for her was too great, also for the overseer. Release
came through Lawrence John, who was wrestling with a cold. Milly,
with a young girl's joy in a baby, in her abounding energy gave
more attention to her little cousin than did his mother. It was her
delight to smuggle him to her bed these cold nights.</p>

<p>"I hear Lawrence John," said his mother, "and, ah ha! he's away
from my room."</p>

<p>"I'll go to him. I want him," exclaimed Milly, forgetting Ronald
in the plaint of her animated doll. Aileen did not gainsay. As
Milly left the room the draught from the door caused the flame of
the lamp to lick its chimney to blackness. The overseer sprang up
to shut the door and went out with Milly and away to his own room;
he too was suffering a cold.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ronnie! Are you really going away, when?" broke from
Aileen.</p>

<p>"I have to be back at the Flats ready to start operations early
on Monday morning."</p>

<p>Aileen looked at him tremulously. "How can I bear it?"</p>

<p>"You have Milly and the nipper."</p>

<p>"Yes, but SP-over-J. Oh, you don't understand; the very thought
of him makes me feel limp and tired like I used to before I found
you again."</p>

<p>"Cheer up! Let's hope he breaks his neck one of these days."</p>

<p>"Oh, but he won't. I'm afraid you'll break yours."</p>

<p>"Say it is too cold for the nipper and go down to Turrill
Turrill. I could easily pop across from Macfarlanes."</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't! They'd see through that. I was so anxious to
stay up here; besides, Lucy is settled there now.</p>

<p>"But you're the boss, when all is said and done."</p>

<p>Aileen shook her head tearfully. "Will you write?"</p>

<p>"Bather risky, don't you think; everyone knows every letter and
who it is from."</p>

<p>"You could write to Milly and I could read between the
lines."</p>

<p>"Poor old Milly. She might read between the lines, too."</p>

<p>"She's only a sentimental little girl. Besides, I want Larry to
marry her when she is old enough."</p>

<p>"It looks as if Larry and Dot would be more likely."</p>

<p>"Do you think they will make a go of it?"</p>

<p>"It seems to have blown over, and she is away, but if what they
said was true they ought to have married a year ago."</p>

<p>"What did they say?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to throw any stones or I might get my own glass
shivered, but Dot went the pace for a while. That's generally the
end of horsey women."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's only horsiness, and they make the rest up."</p>

<p>"Very likely."</p>

<p>He was not going to traduce Dot, She had too plainly favoured
him. He felt rather guilty, having found her a grateful refuge in
the days of his despair, and having sheered off callously only
after a certain trip to Melbourne. The look in Dot's eyes had
sometimes shamed him in light of what he himself had been through.
Now here was young Milly, so straight and sincere, more
affectionate and generous than Dot. He did not want to hurt her
himself, and he did not think Larry good enough for her. At any
rate Milly did not consider Larry at all, and Larry, if Ronald knew
anything, had reaped a harvest from Dot's reckless
disappointment.</p>

<p>Otherwise there were his own affairs, and a virile young man
still enamoured of his one-time love, now the wife of the hated old
conqueror by wrongful pressure, does not live by platonic bread
alone. Lawrence John took a lot of comforting that night. Milly
could not leave him.</p>

<p>Jane Humphreys, successor to her sisters, when she knew the
Missus and Mr Dice to be alone, suffered overweening curiosity to
observe them. She was not always able to hear what they were
saying, but the amateur construction of the house afford
opportunity for the eye. Before retiring she entertained Long Billy
with the result of her observations. Billy came in for more
familiar treatment when most of the kitchen courtiers were
dispersed by winter.</p>

<p>"Golly! If you want a circus, you oughter sneak inter the back
passage and see the Missus and Ron Dice kissin' an' muggin'
like..." She doubled in giggles.</p>

<p>"Garn! You're makin' it up! Where's young Milly? She's supposed
to be the gooseberry."</p>

<p>"The kid is squawkin' an she's lookin' after him."</p>

<p>"The next one'll have to be called Ronald," said Long Billy with
loud delight in his own wit.</p>

<p>"You shut up! You shouldn't say such flash hold things to a
girl."</p>

<p>"Better by a long shove than doin' them. A pity young Milly
doesn't come upon 'em suddent. It'd cure her. I wonder what she
would do."</p>

<p>"Oh, she's too simple. She wouldn't understand. They'd smoodge
her over with some yarn. I heard some of what they was sayin' too.
It was real rich...these swells if you ask me...</p>

<p>"Fat lot of swell about old Healey and his wallaby-run at
Neangen!"</p>

<p>"But they used ter own some reel swell place on Monaro."</p>

<p>"Got it in a swell way too, if what you hear is gospel."</p>

<p>"Well, the Stantons and Saunderses and Mazeres are real
swells."</p>

<p>"Some of the old coves is, but some of them others will be lucky
to have as good a job as I have, if I know anything. Tell me what
you heard."</p>

<p>"You tell me something first."</p>

<p>"I know so much I don't know where to begin. Suppose I tell you
that the horse killed out at Corroboree rings wasn't Romp at
all."</p>

<p>"Well, I never! What was it, then?"</p>

<p>"An' what's more it was chucked over there, just to lead 'em
astray."</p>

<p>"Did you know at the time?"</p>

<p>"Er course I did. What do you take me for?"</p>

<p>"Smarty!"</p>

<p>"I wuz smarter than the others, even ole Poole who's supposed to
be such a crack&mdash;better'n a black tracker&mdash;he didn't know
no better neither."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell him?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes it pays not to tell all a cove knows."</p>

<p>"Pooh, I suppose they knew all the time and just didn't want to
upset Milly."</p>

<p>Jane had a masterly way of discrediting Long Billy's most
important announcements. He made a further effort.</p>

<p>"But the Young Whisker filly ain't dead at all!"</p>

<p>"Well, I never! Tell me about it."</p>

<p>"Only if you tell me what you heard 'em say first."</p>

<p>There followed an unsavoury account of Dot Saunders and Larry
Healey as touched upon by Dice and Aileen. Only great Sodoms afford
safe cover for irregularities, and even the greatest cities
sometimes unexpectedly belch their secrets.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p>It was a cold wet winter and the dingoes hungry and hold, Foals
and calves that came out of season were not safe from them and kept
the rouseabouts and boundary-riders busy setting traps and laying
baits and trying to get a tough old enemy or two with the
rifle.</p>

<p>Aileen was terrified of dingoes and had a notion that they would
carry off Lawrence John, but he was safe with the faithful Towser,
who never let his charge out of his sight during the day and kept
within scent of him by night. His mother slept with her head under
the blankets and wept with fright when the howl of the pack was
borne down the deep lone gullies of Ten Creeks and Jinninjinninbong
by the spifflicating winds from the source of the Snowy. She could
have gone to Riverina but SP-over-J was there, and to remain at Ten
Creeks relieved her of his company. Milly stoutly stuck to her
post, though trekking to Turrill Turrill would have taken her
nearer to Ronald.</p>

<p>Her fibre was different from Aileen's. The lonelier and louder
the howl of the dogs on the wild winds the more she enjoyed it, and
when it was augmented by the wail of curlews and plovers as well as
the clamour of the chained station dogs, she listened enchanted. It
seemed like a tocsin of something more intrepid than pottering
about the house, gardening when the ground permitted, playing with
Lawrence John, and occasionally going out on the Run in the hunts
for the shy rock-wallabies, whose skins made luxurious bed- and
buggy-rugs. It was her delight when night had fallen to walk on the
ridge beside the Coolgarbilli and imitate the moan of the dingoes.
There was a deep gully on the other side of the river walled by
precipitous cliffs through which Mountain Creek in musical hurry
joined the larger stream, and which was a congenial highway for the
canine depredators. It was sport for Milly to decoy them to the
river's edge. Her mimicry was so good that they would come in
force. The men set traps and baits there and a dozen brushes, as
well as a few paws left in the traps, were credited to Milly, who
was cherished by the station-hands for her courage and high
spirits. The overseer was her avowed slave, as were several of the
hands, who could not express their feelings. They could, however,
discuss her among themselves. "Wonder who'll carry her off?"</p>

<p>"Alistair Farquharson has the runnin' to himself these days. Aw,
she looks on him like a brother an' seems sweetest on Ron
Dice."</p>

<p>"Too much of a kid to know her own mind."</p>

<p>"Wait till she does and there'll be some fun."</p>

<p>"I reckon she knows her own mind now. I'd like to see thorn
tryin' to marry her off to some old hide like was done with the
Missus..."</p>

<p>"Oh, the Missus, she's a &mdash;&mdash;, one of them faggots
that lays down under things an' lets everyone do what they like
with her."</p>

<p>"I reckon there'll be a big bust-up there one of these days.
There ought to be if ole Skinny Guts ain't blind."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he's tired of her now an' don't care."</p>

<p>"Ail the same, he wouldn't he wantin' another bloke to make a
mug of him. You jist wait a bit!"</p>

<p>"Do you think young Milly knows?"</p>

<p>"Not she! Too innercent. Doesn't know how them things is worked.
Golly, wouldn't I jist like..."</p>

<p>"Like what?"</p>

<p>"Aw, nothing. I was just thinkin' how some fellers has hell's
own luck."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Aw, to git a nice inner cent young girl."</p>

<p>"But what about the girl's luck?"</p>

<p>"That's different. Their luck is to git a lot of spondulics for
theirselves without sweating their eyeballs out for it, an' a nice
little treasure like ole Skinny throwed in."</p>

<p>There followed guffaws and unprintable obscenities about
procreative functions and existence in general, and in particular
as applied to Mr and Mrs Stanton of 'ion Creeks Bun and Turril!</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>While Aileen found lite an intolerable ache of inaction till
Dice should return to her neighbourhood, Milly was considerably if
not worthily employed. Mr Blenkinsop had done her good service
during his reign, for time conventions of his education at least
directed him towards the classics and he had supplied Milly with a
pile of these. She read every other romance procurable, from Miss
Braddon's to Rhoda Broughton's, and one or two of her admirers were
astute enough to discover her preference for books before sweets.
The pity was the absence of anyone to introduce her to the best
literary pabulum for her vigorous ripening intelligence.</p>

<p>Lack of engagement of her mental energy in such an environment
resulted in entertainment through her many admirers&mdash;neither
consciously nor maliciously as a coquette, but inevitably. She had
been strictly reared in the convention that a man must make all the
sexual advances. In her code a girl should not lower herself by
pursuing her predilection, but must stifle emotions till they were
wooed into life. It was a useful inhibition in Milly's case. Her
adolescent fancy clothed Dice in romance and the correspondence
with which he favoured her became engrossing. Her letters were so
frank and open that neither her mother as guardian, nor Aileen as
rival, could find in them cause for alarm. Ronald's were in the
same style, with not a line of capital for a breach-ofpromise
action. Occasionally there was a message on which Aileen could feed
her heart, though it was to "Aunt Aileen".</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Milly's imagination was engaged. She hungered for
the tone in Ronald's letters that she felt must develop. This made
her sometimes play up the faithful Alistair, whom the winter had
not deterred from riding up every now and again. Aileen's
loneliness too induced her to coax her brother, Larry, to visit
her. He had to come across snowy ranges, and had not been at Ten
Creeks for two years, but being in a chastened mood after his
danger and kind rescue by good old Norah, felt a sudden family
affection and decided one Saturday to ride over and visit
Aileen.</p>

<p>He was too ashamed to go near Norah those clays, so happy was
she in the success of her hoax. There was something imbecile,
almost indecent, in this ratty old pair's obsession with parentage,
even vicariously. Larry had not seen the child and lived in mortal
terror of it. Dot's name was never mentioned to him. He kept
sedulously out of the Saunderses' path and they never by line or
word took any notice of him. He could not marry Dot when she so
truculently repudiated him and was not even in the district, and
thus in an unexpected way he had escaped the consequences of their
fall.</p>

<p>He arrived at Ten Creeks one August evening. He saw Milly. He
was dumbfounded by the change in her. He had liked her and been
friendly with her in her hobbledehoy stage, and the new Milly in
winter association threw him headlong into a torrent of passion. A
gun could not have kept him away thereafter. Aileen's loneliness
was an excuse for his presence and in bad weather he could break
his journey with Dan and Joanna at Wamgarnbril Springs.</p>

<p>His entanglement with Dot had started with the bad influence of
what had transpired with Aileen. Times were hard, he had been
looking round for a girl from a propertied family. Their interest
in horses and Aileen's marriage into the family had thrown him and
Dot together. The combination of boredom, disappointment,
waywardness, and lack of self-discipline, had been responsible for
what followed, and Larry was as put to it as Dot to comprehend why.
It had done something to generate in Larry what in his day was
called a soul. He felt real shame in light of the swift clean flood
that overtook him concerning Milly. A decent record would have
given him more courage.</p>

<p>Soon the intensity of his passion smothered all scruples of
unworthiness, leaving only determination to possess at any cost and
all hazards. Sophistry upheld him. In the first place no one knew
of the disaster with Dot but those whose interest it was to bury
the secret. Norah and Alf could not divulge it without making of
themselves a laughing-stock from Bool Bool to Monaro and back to
Queanbeyan and Yass. The Saunderses were unlikely to deflect Milly
from him at the sacrifice of Dot and their own shame. The Stantons
and Saunderses though a clannish family had internecine rivalries
and would rather have let outsiders know their disgrace than for
one arm of the family to confess inferiority to the other.</p>

<p>Larry blessed Dot now for her fierce repudiation of him which
left him without public scathe. He hoped she would collar some
other fellow and all would be safe. Thus in the beginning there was
no obstacle but Milly's attitude. She laughed at him. There had
been no change in him from chrysalis to butterfly. He was the same
old Larry and her fancy otherwise engaged. Larry, however, in his
first real surrender was so whole-hearted and engaging that he did
not alienate her.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Spring broke at length. The Macfarlanes, upon the advice of
their mountain manager, were to remove their sheep to Goraig Flats
early that season. Dice came up well ahead to see to fences, etc.,
and was the real inauguration of the season on Ten Creeks Run.
SP-over-J arrived shortly after to be ready for the horse muster.
He was glad to be with Lawrence John, for he was not wanting in
parental affection, and the boy, now a little over three, was full
of allure.</p>

<p>Aileen began to live again.</p>

<p>Another who found a renewal of life was Cuppinbingle Potter. He
was described as a man of the world and fitted the description in
all that the term implies of the sexual activities of a lusty,
open-air man entering the forties. He had such a sparkling
reputation for cicisbeism that SP-over-J, imperilled by a young and
very pretty wife, was uneasy by his established visits to the Run.
His fears were groundless. Aileen was much too insipid. A man who
handles thoroughbred horses applies the same standard to women, and
it is a high one. Since clapping his eyes on the blood filly, as
Cuppinbingle thought of Milly&mdash;far from disrespect&mdash;all
other women had grown stale. She was very young, and often he
halted with the unhappy reckoning that when a girl rising eighteen
would be thirty-six, a man of forty-two, alas, would be sixty, and
the world simply alive with men ready to act with Mrs Donald
Galliard Potter as Mr Donald Galliard Potter had earned renown by
acting with a good half-dozen ladies, whose husbands, he flattered
himself, had been entirely fooled. His own tactics would make him
for ever suspicious if in possession of an attractive wife. Then
Milly would banish melancholy. He would be at the top of his form
and appetite for ten or fifteen years yet, and ten, even five or
two years with Milly was a heaven of reward for a subsequent
eternity of cuckolding or discontent. The girl was a thoroughbred.
It was in her carriage and her mellow little waist, plump yet
supple, and achieved with a minimum of the lacing necessary to
other women. And oh, the peach and roses of her skin, her luxuriant
shining hair, her soft and saucy chin, round and comfortable,
denoting stability! He had noted that the little heart-shaped faces
like Aileen's had no strength back of them. When he betrayed
husbands it was likely to be with one of those enchanting little
baggages without the backbone to stand firm to either side. But
Milly had mettle. It was in the play of her lips, in the flash of
her clear, brave, grey eyes. She was sure to have a paddy, and
there was nothing in the whole gamut of passion so thrilling as a
thoroughbred with her monkey up. Milly in a corner would fight
gamely, life or death, not survive by compliance. And the fragrant
youth of her!</p>

<p>The thought of Milly clothed only in her own luxuriant tresses
lured him on to accept the noose of matrimony, that being the only
noose that could be spread for Milly. Once married of her own
choice he felt sure she would stand firm as any woman under heaven
had ever been known to stand. It gave the hardened philanderer the
best thrill in years to dream of teaching Milly her first thrills,
of breaking her to matrimony. Appetite had him in full cry the year
in question and he was confident enough to appear at Ten Creeks
without subterfuge. He was specially affable to his hostess: his
technique embraced all women more or less, but never missed the
young and beautiful.</p>

<p>"He's using Milly as a blind," cogitated Stanton, his suspicions
alert towards Cuppinbingle while they had gone dormant in regard to
Bookaledgeree.</p>

<p>Potter knew to a nicety how the competitors were placed. The
child, he calculated, was taken with Dice, but nothing
serious&mdash;a girl's day-dream of love rather than the mastering
passion itself, and a glance exposed Dice's tactics. Milly, the
peerless, unbacked filly used as a blind for that other piece of
mere rag! Cuppinbingle snorted at the lack of judgment of some
fellows, consequent upon being "rared onder a hin", as his retainer
put it. He chuckled to estimate how Milly would take being used as
a screen. Make that obvious to her&mdash;himself careful not to be
the bearer of bad news, and Dice's pot would go on with a whack.
Then what remained but the tail of a poor field. Lucky for him that
Milly was hidden in the scrubs at Ten Creeks instead of in her
rightful stall among the d&eacute;butantes, where she would soon
begin to feel her oats. Financial stringency had postponed the
society year projected. He could dispose of Dice easily enough,
though it was not his man-of-the-world philosophy to spoil sport
where he owed no allegiance. He must pull strings and make others
do the work. A string unexpectedly pulled on him caused him to pull
one almost unintentionally in return.</p>

<p>One Saturday night in September several were sitting round the
fire at Ten Creeks, a frost still crisping the bridle-tracks
without and making it cosy within. Stanton, Dash, the surveyor, and
Potter were left in the dining-room while the others drifted to the
sitting-room, from which sounds of gaiety streamed. Stanton's jokes
were frequently ill-placed and rarely merry.</p>

<p>"I was thinking of going to Bool Bool tomorrow," he observed,
"but I'll have to leave Mr Dash to chaperone my wife&mdash;not safe
to leave her with a lady-killer like Potter."</p>

<p>To be thus marooned with his ancient host, who was hoodwinked by
Dice and to watch Milly's eyes brightening for the fellow, to hear
her laugh ringing out for him as she played his accompaniments
while he mushed love songs, which even the dummies knew were for
that short-weight, Aileen, put Cuppinbingle off his form, or he
would never have rapped out, "Lot of chance I have with the field
in full possession of a gay young flipper like Dice."</p>

<p>"We'd better get Miss Milly to give us a song," said Dash, also
somewhat a man of the world. Stanton rose abruptly to watch the
tableau in the next room, himself unseen in the doorway. Milly was
at the piano. Larry was hanging round her turning the leaves,
Ronald was singing a saccharine atrocity with a chorus about,</p>

<p>"Right into the arms of my truly love, Singing tooralai,
ooralai, aye."</p>

<p>He had a true ear and a sweet lilt in his voice. He was looking
towards Aileen. Her gaze was towards him in the light of the fire,
her heart exposed. SP-over-J let his guests enter his drawing-room
alone. He walked out bareheaded into the uninhabited universe under
the blazing, frosty stars, and circled the premises hot with a fire
perhaps as old as the sun's rays, for all that can be proven to the
contrary. Possession of a pretty young wife had long since lost its
novelty. A sense of triumph had shaken down to the prosaic salt
beef and damper of married existence, but was there danger of him
being fooled before the world? This would be worse than defeat
before marriage. But very likely old Cuppinbingle was trying to put
him off the scent, he would be cunning enough for that. Aileen was
rendered mushy by any sentimental song no matter who sang it.
SP-over-J went inside with his eyes open.</p>

<p>Ronald was now scuffling among the music head to head with
Milly, and Potter sitting near Aileen paying her meaty compliments,
by the look of her. Larry was agitating for a game of forfeits, a
device highly popular among the amorous to procure a kiss. Stanton
watched the game critically and was entirely deceived by
appearances. Ronald not once but several times passed by Aileen in
favour of Miss Farquharson and Milly's school friend or Milly
herself, while Cuppinbingle with great flourish approached his
hostess. All was normal as far as Dice was concerned. There were
always a lot of idle remarks flying about, and if a man went about
with a chip on his shoulder because of them he would be safe only
in an asylum, reflected the boss.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Larry's fervent wish was to hear of Dot picking up some decent
fellow and settling out of the district. Her family wished
likewise. They heard something far less satisfactory. When the
trouble had been averted, old Tom objected to the continued expense
of keeping Dot in Sydney, and ordered her home. She again proved
refractory. She did not want to see Bool Bool again where her shame
would be everlastingly thrown in her face. The family were alarmed.
How was Dot to support herself? The second scandal promised to be
worse than the first.</p>

<p>"She can go to blazes so long as she keeps out of my sight,"
said her father.</p>

<p>"But people don't keep out of knowledge even if they are out of
sight," said Mrs Saunders. "Look at what we know about the
skeletons in other people's cupboards though they think we know
nothing."</p>

<p>"That's mostly true," Tom, jun., had agreed. "But it is a great
help to keep a thing as private as you can. If it is public it is
the first thing told to a newcomer to the district, while if it's
pretty yell squashed it can only be told as a rumour and not given
so much credence by the fair-minded. People may suspect something
cronk about Dot, but they couldn't be sure if only she would behave
now. She must come home and go straight."</p>

<p>"It's no good of trying to drive her," said Maud. "She'll go mad
again and that will be worse, as people will say it is in the
family."</p>

<p>They inquired what Dot proposed to do to support herself. She
replied that she had taken a situation as housemaid at a
first-class hotel. She was a strong, capable young woman, and like
all squat-, ters' daughters worth the name, able to do anything
from baking a batch of bread to ironing a stiff white-bosomed
shirt, driving four-in-hand and shooting, or making her own frocks.
The work of a housemaid was no hardship physically.</p>

<p>"Housemaid at the Wynyard, where people from here and Monaro
stay!"</p>

<p>"I don't care!" said Pa. "I wash my hands of her. She has gone
mad. It didn't come from my side of the family, anyone can see
that, and I don't care what people think. Hardly a family but has a
lunatic of some sort in it, and they have to put up with it. Look
at the O'Maras, respectable people as ever breathed, and in a good
position, yet there is old Teddy running about the country."</p>

<p>Pa overlooked Ma. Stupid of him considering he had had a
generation of her perfectly feminine conventional persistence in
getting her own meek way in face of the most truculent male
decrees, flapping of wings, or loud bellowings. Ma's health became
precarious forthwith. Her heart played up. Pa had to be up at all
hours of the night warming irons to put in the bed and to
administer teaspoonfuls of brandy. Worse than all, he could never
talk on any subject, whether the price of wool, the curse of fluke,
the scoundrelly bumptiousness of the working men in relation to the
great strikes, the breaking of the banks, or the deterioration in
horse-flesh and youths since his young days, because Ma had to
detail her symptoms with abounding garrulity; and the married
daughters could not be absent from their own families to nurse Ma,
and people incessantly inquired if Dot realized her mother's
break-up, and commented upon her continued absence in Sydney,
enjoying herself, while her mother needed her so sorely.</p>

<p>Pa became as rabid to have Dot home as he had formerly been to
get rid of her, and wrote a letter. The missive wrung his withers,
but parenthood is full of similar shoals and tribulations. He
ordered and pleaded in turn. He execrated Dot for her lack of
filial affection to let her mother die in cold blood, and stated
his willingness to let bygones be bygones if Dot would settle down
at home and take care of Ma. The price of a first-class fare was
enclosed.</p>

<p>Dot was not sufficiently iconoclastic to desert a dying mother.
She returned to Saunders Plains. She became retiring in her manner
and was seen abroad only at church, and that rarely. She put her
retirement on the state of her mother's health, but people surmised
that something must have happened in Sydney.</p>

<p>"Must have been trying for some smart city chap and got left,"
said Lucy Saunders. "And she's getting on now. If she doesn't soon
catch someone, she'll be an old maid."</p>

<p>"She always was a bit high and mighty, and being in Sydney, I
suppose she doesn't think anyone is good enough for her now,"
responded her brother Jack.</p>

<p>Only Mrs Isaacs was sure of the cause. "It came off all right,"
she said to the Mayoress. "I wonder what they did with the
child?"</p>

<p>"Now, do ye really believe it was thrue, Rebecca?"</p>

<p>"True as that we sit here."</p>

<p>"Some of thim Sydney doctors is terrible smart now, they might
have taken methods. Sure, it's a wicked thing to think of!"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't do to whisper a word about it, us in business."</p>

<p>"Sure, ivery heart knows its own sorrer."</p>

<p>"I hear Larry is now wild after Milly at Ten Creeks. If they
don't look out something will be happening there, too."</p>

<p>"Milly's a noice choild&mdash;not that sort."</p>

<p>"It's the most unlikely that seem to go off the rails. Look at
Dot&mdash;who'd have thought it, and with Larry Healey, who they've
always turned their noses up at."</p>

<p>"Sure, Milly ought to be sthopped from marryin' a feller like
that, if it's thrue."</p>

<p>"It's true as eggs are not fish. You couldn't deceive
Jacob."</p>

<p>"Still an' all ye can't prove it, Rebecca."</p>

<p>"It will all come out in the wash."</p>

<p>Fortunately they had heard nothing to throw suspicion on the
parenthood of Mr and Mrs Alfred Timson at Billy-go-Billy, and the
little Norah Alfreda throve in love and indulgence. Larry, hearing
of Dot's return, had a fresh access of fear. Conscience-smitten, he
scraped up a five-pound note, not without personal sacrifice,
seeing the times and the strain put upon his exchequer by the Ten
Creeks adventure, and sent it to Norah. She wrote in return a
kindly letter, heavily sealed and ambiguously orded, begging that
he should not act so again, as it was not necessary. Larry was much
relieved that Norah did not ask him to go to Billy-go-Billy, for
the thought of his daughter filled him with terror. Norah wished to
minimize Larry's ownership of her treasure. As a certain young lady
did not care for him, she prayed that she as well as Larry would
soon be happy with someone else. This, Alf and Norah calculated,
would be safer for their foster-parenthood than if the two parents
were to marry.</p>

<p>Mrs Saunders was equally relieved that Norah begged her too
never to send another five-pound note.</p>

<p>"God bless old Norah and Alf," thought Larry. Norah's hope that
lie would be happy with someone else seemed to free him officially
from obligation to Dot, and he turned more assuredly to Milly. Dot
and her family entirely ignored him and this released him from
blame in the episode unmentionable. He felt sure it had not been
divulged even to Milly's mother, though she was a sister-in-law of
Saunders Plains.</p>

<p>He was familiar with every gully and spur and sideling,
wombat-holed or lyre-bird decorated, where the gyang-gyangs
screeched or the eagles nested on the way from Neangen to Ten
Creeks homestead. He had reached that degree of obsession when he
would have bartered his soul for a kiss from Milly, and his
undisciplined desire led him to day-dream of situations to give him
possession of her, as he despaired of winning her conventionally.
He was too engrossed to observe the aftermath developing under his
elbow, and the miraculous way he had escaped, without scathe or
responsibility for his dishonourable conduct with Dot, was
dangerous to his mood.</p>

<p>"Milly, don't you think you could care some clay?" he pleaded
one week-end when he had her alone, decorating the vases for
Sunday.</p>

<p>"Now, Larry, you're always squeaking like that. Let's look at it
from practical real life. I don't think I ever shall, but supposing
I did, what then?"</p>

<p>"We could marry and settle clown like other people, couldn't
we?"</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious, how terrible! Just look at all the old
married women, so dragged-out looking and like a bundle of hay or a
clucking hen if they try to ride again. Just that old dull life, on
and On; oh, dear me, no!"</p>

<p>"But it would be duller if you never got married and were an old
maid. Now, that would be terrible."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You'd soon be sick of being in some other woman's home and
bossed about."</p>

<p>"But I could have a home of my own like Miss M'Eachern."</p>

<p>"Nice dried-up looking piece of old leather she is!"</p>

<p>"Then I'd like something entirely different."</p>

<p>"How do you mean, different?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm reading a story about a girl now. A lovely young man
loved her so much that he broke into her father's house and carried
her off one night."</p>

<p>"By Jove, if that's all you want, I'd break into Goulburn jail
and carry you off by force&mdash;this very night. I'd think it no
end of a lark."</p>

<p>"But I don't want you to. If you did...oh, well, it's no use. I
can't explain."</p>

<p>"Is there anyone else you'd like to break into your room and
carry you off? What about old potty Potter?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't he be a card!" Milly laughed merrily. Larry was
reassured.</p>

<p>"Or Alistair Farquharson?"</p>

<p>"You mustn't make fun of Alistair. He is too good for me really,
only that I just don't want to marry him."</p>

<p>"It's not Ronald..."</p>

<p>"This talk is getting very silly," said Milly, going to place
two glass slippers filled with violets on the mantel and keeping
her back turned. From there she escaped under the excuse of seeing
what Lawrence John was doing, but the faithful Towser was on the
job, moving his long-suffering head aside each time his master
tried to poke a stick in his eye.</p>

<p>Larry walked about the ridge where the music of the Coolgarbilli
was like an urging wind and all the world wild and untrammelled as
his thoughts, which ran dangerously on some way of compromising
Milly so that her family would welcome the disposal of her to
himself.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p>SP-over-J passed quietly by the veranda of the men's hut where
Long Billy, Tim Porter, Mick Muldoon, and a Keba rouseabout were
patching pack-saddles to take rock-salt to the back of Mount
Corroboree to trap wild horses, which had lured away several of the
station yearlings. The time of the muster was at hand again and the
usual crowd gathering at Ten Creeks. The boss paused to give an
order, and incautious voices reached his ears.</p>

<p>"What do you think of ole Bill Heffernan's bet now?"</p>

<p>"Aw, I dunno. 'Wait till old Skinny Guts gits on to it, there'll
be a shindy worth watchin'."</p>

<p>"He must know it now or else he's a bigger mopoke than ole Teddy
O'Mara."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it ain't any good of him knowin'. What could an ole
whistle like him do about it?"</p>

<p>It suddenly came to Stanton that these references were to
himself. Any boss of men must be of foolishness out-fooling the
Teddy O'Maras to imagine that he is generally mentioned in any more
flattering terms by his vassals in a free country, but there was
more in this than that to SP-over-J. Old Skinny Guts was bad
enough, but that other epithet contained an aspersion to make any
he-man take his gun, if offered direct. To overhear it bandied
about among rouseabouts&mdash;a doubt upon his virility, the
parentage of his child! Hell! His wife's child.</p>

<p>Had he plucked himself together at that moment he could have put
two and two together concerning his heir's immediate lineage, and
nothing under heaven could have dickered with the sum total, but an
old man does not retain sanity and sweet reasonableness when he
hears his employed hands obscenely discussing him, especially when
a neighbour of Potter's proclivities has already flung a suggestion
in his teeth. The rage of hell racked Stanton's thin bosom. He
would fling the brat in the Coolgarbilli and its &mdash;&mdash; of
a mother after it. A shot would do for Dice and a couple more in
the backsides for the rouseabouts who dared to describe him
thus.</p>

<p>Never in his life had such stinging humiliation been his. It
blackened the sun and poisoned the air, the divine air in that
region of eucalypts and singing streams. He turned to the stable
cat-footed, and took out his horse&mdash;the Wamgambril
colt&mdash;to the sheltering gully back of the stables that carried
Breakfast Creek, along which he escaped unseen to ride he cared not
whither so long as he could ease his rage. On he went, on and on,
past Gyang Gyang Creek and Corroboree Creek, taking no note of the
time he was consuming or the sweat he was drawing from his horse,
or the circling eagles and crows, the fluttering gyang-gyangs, or
the willy-wagtails tweetering, "Sweet pretty creature! Sweet pretty
creature!" or the scattering kangaroos, or the horse and cattle
tracks which might have been valuable data to the musterers. After
a time he was right at the side of Mount Corroboree where he had
not been since the search for the Young Whisker filly.</p>

<p>His horse was a trifle blown through being driven up pinch after
pinch without mercy. Stanton got off to give him a spell. Then he
rode by the old Corroboree rings, where the tall daisies were
budding, to the edge of the precipice over which Romp had fallen,
and for a wild moment felt like riding off it too, but the
Wamgambril, mountain bred, would not be urged within danger.
Stanton dismounted again, and while giving his beast a chance to
recover set in motion a loose rock. Down it went, breaking through
half-grown trees and the unfurling tree-ferns with the thunder of a
cannon to crash into the stream below. Rock after rock followed
with reverberating echoes in the far-reaching quiet, which Stanton
had all to himself. The startled bird citizens whirred up and away
in flocks, chattering about the phenomenon as they flew.</p>

<p>The aching immutable stillness had its influence. One might beat
with rage against that for an eternity with no effect but to
demonstrate human impotence, human insignificance. Nothing came
from his outbreak but the refreshing perfume of broken tea-tree,
heath, or bracken. The rocks crashed without injury to anyone or
anything under the deep blue bowl but a pinprick or two to the
stately scrub.</p>

<p>The exercise relieved rage. The quiet restored reason. Stanton
reflected that probably the rocks had echoed no such racket since
the black men had come a generation back to celebrate and feast on
the bogongs. As a boy he remembered them trooping from Mungee and
Coolooluk. Now only Diamond, son of Nanko, and a few pathetic
specimens remained. They had vanished, leaving no trace but the
indistinct circus rings where the immortelles blossomed, but never
a tree invaded to this day. Not long and he too would have
vanished, and what the sense of his agitation?</p>

<p>His horse, now sweat dry and recovered his wind, provided the
final touch of healing by snatching at the sweet heads of kangaroo
grass, his good appetite unperturbed by the cannonade, which he had
accepted after a preliminary jerk and toss of his imperial head.
Mother birds returned to their labours; the silence was filled with
the endearing clamour of ever-hungry nestlings. Stanton turned
towards home feeling a little sick from foolishness. After all,
what had he to go upon? Nothing. He laughed when the term, which
had maddened him, was applied by some wag to one of his associates,
and thought none the less of the butt of the pleasantry.</p>

<p>He was thankful he had said nothing. No one but his horse
suspected what a fool he had been, and he was dumb. Far down the
gully from whence the music of a creek ascended could be seen leafy
bowers of tree-ferns, sassafras, and tea-tree, and spear-pointed
trees of matchless grace indicating young timber. Above rose Mount
Corroboree, black and forbidding, silent and still for ever, a
dignified sentinel above the tree-tops&mdash;mile on mile, ridge on
ridge of greens melting into hazy blues with distance.</p>

<p>He rode homeward steadily where to the west the white clouds
were massing in mountains fringed with molten gold, of magnificent
beauty, and presaging a thunderstorm.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>The household awaited the boss in vain for the midday meal. A
rouseabout testified that he was coming towards the house from the
garden when he last saw him. Investigation showed his horse was not
in the stable and the boy was regarded as an unreliable witness.
When Stanton was four hours late there was speculation as to where
he could be.</p>

<p>"I'd go and look for him only I don't know which way he went,"
said Ronald.</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," said Larry.</p>

<p>Milly put on her habit and Larry saddled her horse, a beautiful
creature named Merrylegs, lent by Uncle Bert to compensate for the
loss of Romp. Larry tossed her to her saddle saying they would go
down the Coolgarbilli. Milly looked back for Ronald, but he said,
"I'll go the other way," and Milly could not desert Larry without
confusion. Ronald stood with Aileen on the veranda watching M
illy's spirited and skilled departure on a mare plunging and
reefing with spring rejuvenation.</p>

<p>"I must to horse too," said Ronald jocularly, "and, fair madam,
a kiss if I bring your good man safely home, and three or as many
as I like if I find him with his neck broken."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ronnie, how wicked you are! Ssh! the servants will see you,
and you are claiming your payment in advance."</p>

<p>Milly came out on the clearing and looked back. "Whatever are
Ronald and Aunt Aileen doing," she cried gaily and innocently.
"You'd think he was kissing her like anything."</p>

<p>"I wish I looked as nearly like kissing you," responded
Larry.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly!" admonished Milly, dashing away at full
gallop.</p>

<p>"Do you think anything could have happened to Jack?" said Aileen
after a while.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. He's mooching about the run somewhere. Very
likely had a bit of tucker with him. It's silly to go looking for
him. Nothing ever happens to an old codger married to a beautiful
young wife against her will. He'll be thriving when we are both
eighty and toothless."</p>

<p>"Lawrence John is very quiet," said Aileen a little later. "I
expect he has fallen asleep on Towser." She went to the dining-room
where they had left the child with his faithful friend. He was not
there. Aileen went through the other rooms, then out on the back
veranda. "They must have gone for a walk," she remarked going
towards the kitchen. Here she found Jane reproducing her own drama
but without the complexity of a deceived husband.</p>

<p>"Have you got the baby and Towser here?"</p>

<p>"No, Mrs Stanton. He was in the dining-room when Miss Milly and
Mr Larry went off riding."</p>

<p>"See has he gone down to the hut." He had been known to do
that.</p>

<p>Long Billy presently returned without the child. "Old Towser
must have him asleep somewhere," said the rouseabout, and set up a
whistling.</p>

<p>Everybody whistled. A dozen loose dogs responded, but not
Towser.</p>

<p>Fear clutched Aileen's heart. Had the child toddled into the
Coolgarbilli, and was Towser guarding him there? She rushed along
the bank while others made for the stables, creek, or searched
among the raspberry canes and gooseberry bushes in the orchard and
garden.</p>

<p>Long Billy called Mick Muldoon to him behind the stables. Towser
was there stretched in his death sleep, the foam of his passing
agony fresh upon his muzzle.</p>

<p>"Sure to hell, some clog has brought him a bait an' now 'tis
beginning to look loike as if the choild is lost entoirely. If it's
this way Towser got the bait, beloike the young wan has wandered
into wan of the little holes beyant the cow-yard. Sure, 'twould
take no more than a billy of water to drown a choild of that age
whin he tumbled into it."</p>

<p>Milly returned at that moment and Long Billy told her the news.
Milly immediately took charge. She went to her aunt. "Old Towser
has had a bait," she said. "That is why Lawrence John has popped
out of sight. When did you last see him? He was in the dining-room
when I left."</p>

<p>"That's when I last saw him, too," panted the terrified mother.
"Ronald and I stood a while watching you and Larry and when I
looked round baby was gone, and we couldn't see him anywhere, and
we couldn't find Towser."</p>

<p>"Ronald hadn't set out when you missed the baby," said Larry,
astutely. "How long have you been looking for him?"</p>

<p>"Not fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>"Then you and Ronald were over an hour on the veranda. Towser
and Lawrence John must have roamed towards the stables together,
for Towser would never have left the child, and it would he out
there towards the kennels that the dog would bring a bait. We must
scour round that way. It will soon be dark and there is a
thunderstorm brewing."</p>

<p>"If Towser had a bait, baby is sure to have sucked some of it
too. I can't bear to think of it," said Milly.</p>

<p>"Bear up, little woman," said Larry, kindly. "We must keep our
heads for Aileen's sake. If the poor little nipper got any
strychnine he won't be far."</p>

<p>They ran out together searching again under every bush, beside
every log, in the cow-bails and calf-pen and kennels. Mick followed
the creek at the back. "Sure 'tis as clear, 'tis loike a lookin'
glass. He couldn't be there in his little whoite frock widout Oi'd
see him. But sure, Oi'm afraid 'tis the river he's wandered to, and
that's a horse of a different colour."</p>

<p>"It's a judgment on me," gasped Aileen, running hither and yon,
desperately. "Jack will kill me. I don't care if he does. I deserve
it. Oh, Cod, what am I to do?"</p>

<p>Dice tried in vain to calm her. Here was not only a lost child
but a distracted woman advertising illicit love.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>SP-over-J did not hurry. Watching the sky, he estimated that he
had plenty of time to reach the house before dark and to escape the
storm which seemed to be passing round by Jinninjinninbong. Ile had
rubbed his horse down a little with his saddle-cloth and a brush of
tea-tree, not wishing to look too much as though he had been riding
for a doctor. As he came in sight of the homestead clearing he
detected unusual movement afoot. Skirts&mdash;his wife's and
Jane's&mdash;fluttered on the ridge by the stockyards; men and
clogs could be seen and heard in several directions. He first
encountered Milly, down near the home slip-rails, for she thought
the baby might be in the drain there under the long grasses.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Jack! Lawrence John is lost and we can't find him
anywhere. Poor old Towser took a bait and that's how he strayed
away."</p>

<p>"What's this? Tell me again! Where was he last seen?"</p>

<p>"Larry and I started to look for you about an hour or two ago
and left the baby in the dining-room then, and when we came back he
could not be found."</p>

<p>"Where was your Aunt Aileen?"</p>

<p>"She was just on the front veranda with Ronald. It doesn't seem
possible that he could get right away out of sight so quickly."
Milly's words uttered in innocence were a bomb. Stanton could not
trust himself in the presence of his wife or Dice. The demon that
had erupted earlier burst out again with redoubled fury.</p>

<p>He shouted for Larry and the men and they set off in circles
round the house, so that no possible nook might hide the child.
Night was falling without a moon. Jane and Milly and the cook were
ordered to have a meal ready with all expedition. One man was
dispatched on a speedy colt for the Milfords, the most expert
bushmen of the region. Another went to summon the black trackers by
telegraph from Cootamundra.</p>

<p>Dice was frantically active among the searchers, but it was
presently pointed out by the curious that he kept far away from
SP-over-J.</p>

<p>It was feared that the child was in the Coolgarbilli, but it was
impossible to see into its recesses till daylight. If he was still
alive there was danger of the other creeks with which the area was
veined, and there were dingoes. To guard against them the place was
dotted with groups, each group lighting fires and keeping up a
hullabaloo.</p>

<p>Milly was out among the hardiest. There was none to gainsay her.
Larry was delighted to have her company and constituted himself her
special cavalier in a thoughtful way that was comforting to Milly.
About ten o'clock the threatened thunderstorm burst. The heavy
downpour filled the creeks and created a dozen rivulets of
sufficient strength to sweep away a toddler were he still abroad,
and damped the hopes of the seekers. Nothing could be done in the
dark and rain, but the men remained abroad owing to dingoes, and
because it did not seem human to go to rest with the pet of the
station lost in the bush.</p>

<p>Milly called her little cousin till she was hoarse and weary.
She was among the party that was dispersing the dingoes towards
Mountain Creek. Larry made her a shelter from the wet in the
burnt-out bowl of a great tree. The men built fires to dry
themselves and boiled the billy and ate the snacks with which each
saddle-bag had been provisioned. The night progressed. Larry
persuaded Milly to lie down on his coat and saddle-cloth in her
shelter, for nothing could be done but keep the fires going. Milly
consented in preference to going back to the station, and soon
dozed off. Waking after a time she crept near to the fire,
wondering had there been any news.</p>

<p>The party had been joined by others from Stanton's posse and
were talking, not expecting to be overheard by Miss Milly. Larry
was absent taking his turn in keeping up the ring of dingo-chasing
fires along the precipice.</p>

<p>"I don't reckon we'll ever see the pore little kid again," said
Long Billy. "He's in the river. That's where he is."</p>

<p>"Sure, ye niver can tell. Mr Potter himself was lost whin he was
a nipper. He was out near a week, an' him none the worse for it,
but he was nearer five."</p>

<p>"A year or two makes a great difference in the strength of
little blokes, and there wasn't no thunderstorm and creeks
perhaps."</p>

<p>"A terrible thing for his mother," said Tim Porter.</p>

<p>"She'll feel it a judgment on her," said Jerry Riddall. It was
at this point that Milly was sufficiently awake to grasp what they
were saying.</p>

<p>"Yes, carryin' on there in open daylight with Dice and her
youngster bein' lost. It oughter cure 'em both."</p>

<p>"Anyone with eyes in his head that sore 'er that clay she was
married when she looked at Dice would know how it would turn out.
Old Skinny Guts could force old Healey to sell her but he couldn't
stop her bein' sweet on Dice. You remember I told you that the
first time she ever come to the Run," said Tommy Roper.</p>

<p>"Do you think Dice is as sweet on her as she is on him?" This
from Tim Porter, always alert for romance.</p>

<p>"My bloomin' oath, he is! Ain't he allers here takin' the place
of old Skinny completely?" said Long Billy. "If I told yous half of
what I know, it would raise whiskers on a duck egg."</p>

<p>"Do you reckon ole Skinny knows?"</p>

<p>"Must be blind as a dead goanna if he doesn't. What do you
reckon, Mick?"</p>

<p>"That a shut mouth is good for keepin' the flies out and the
brains in."</p>

<p>"Supposin' you hadn't any brains to keep in, what'd you do?"
asked Paddy Leary of Cuppinbingle.</p>

<p>"'Tis yourself that should know that without askin' annywan else
whatever. Sure, ye've had a power of practice." The guffaw was
against Paddy.</p>

<p>"You haven't been rared onder a turkey hin, eh, Mick? But tell
us, isn't it young Milly that Dice is cocking his eye after?"</p>

<p>"He that has eyes to see, let him see," said Mick.</p>

<p>"Anyone can see without eyes or brains that Larry comes to see
her."</p>

<p>"An' a daisy he is too, to come an' see anyone! What about him
an' Dot Saunders? Tommy, you seen her goin' away an' comin' back,
too, an' you reckon..."</p>

<p>"Tommy has done enough reckonin' to run a store," said Paddy
Leary facetiously.</p>

<p>"He generally reckons right, too," said Roper himself. "I say
that Larry was the man all right."</p>

<p>"If so, whoi didn't he marry her? It would have been too good a
match for him to miss," said Mick Muldoon.</p>

<p>"Old Saunders took a gun to him, that's why. There was near
murder done."</p>

<p>"If things were as Tommy reckons, ole Saunders would er been
glad to pay Larry to marry her," asserted Tim Porter.</p>

<p>"Do you reckon ole Skinny would do anything if he knew about his
missus an' Dice?" inquired Jerry Riddall.</p>

<p>Milly retired, to reappear breaking a twig and coughing. "Where
is Mr Healey?" she demanded briskly. Larry was heard coming from
his rounds with Dash, the surveyor.</p>

<p>"Larry, I shall go home and see how Aunt Aileen is. There is no
need for you to come." But he insisted upon accompanying her.</p>

<p>She did not speak on the way. The night to her had turned much
darker than it is possible for a starless night to be. Larry
attributed her silence to her distress and the discomfort of the
search and held his tongue.</p>

<p>Milly found her aunt alone with Jane Humphreys, sister and
successor of Sarah and Ellen, departed in matrimony. Jane could do
nothing but weep in face of her mistress's distraught manner.
Stanton had not come to her nor sent her any message before joining
in the search. She could neither pray, weep, nor rest. It was a
terrible night for her, wandering in and out of the silent rooms,
stopping to listen where nothing came back out of the silence of
the bush but cooees and whip-cracks, or when there was a lull in
these, the lorn wail of curlew or plover. The night-birds and
dingoes had always frightened and depressed her.</p>

<p>"Have you found him?" she asked Milly and Larry, seeing the
answer in their empty hands.</p>

<p>"Not yet, Aunt Aileen. We must wait till morning. You must bear
up." Larry was touched to see the havoc of the night's events in
Milly. She looked white and ill and there was a stricken look in
her eyes almost like Aileen's.</p>

<p>"It's no use! It's no use!" wailed Aileen. "It is a judgment on
me. Where am I to go? What am I to do?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid she'll go dotty," Jane confided. "She seems to be
wandering, and talks about snakes&mdash;unless, of course, she's
got the D.Ts."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly! How would Aunt Aileen have D.Ts.?" said Milly
reprovingly. "They only come to old boozers."</p>

<p>"Well, it was only that my dad allus talks of snakes when he has
'cm, an' I thought the misses might have had a nip to make her bear
up."</p>

<p>"What she needs is a little spirits now," said Larry.</p>

<p>Mrs Stanton was persuaded to swallow it nobbler, but it produced
only a temporary doze. Milly was also persuaded to take her first
dram, and, by its potency on an empty stomach, forced to accept
Larry's help to a couch, where under a warm rug she slept soundly
till dawn. She awoke to see her uncle meet his wife.</p>

<p>"Have you found him, Jack?" she wailed, running towards him.</p>

<p>"No," he snapped, without seeing Milly, or it might have
restrained him. "What does it matter to you whether he is found or
not? A nice mother you are! A &mdash;&mdash; with your
&mdash;&mdash; while your child is lost. I don't see that it should
matter much to me either, since I don't know whether he is mine or
not. Dice is..."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack, I swear..."</p>

<p>"What does it matter what you swear? You haven't got mind enough
to tell the truth. Get out of my sight and my house! I've had
enough of you." He pushed her as he passed, riot a rough push, but
she fell under his hand. He walked through the house and out, never
looking behind.</p>

<p>His thrust was deeper in the heart of Milly than of Aileen.
Where was Ronald now? Would he step in before the world gallantly
to stand by his love? It is to be doubted if that aspect of it
disturbed Aileen. She was too stricken. Remorse and a sense of
retribution justly fallen was so crushing that neither loyalty nor
desertion on Ronald's part led now power to affect her. It was
Milly who was still normal enough to suffer. On the way home with
Larry, trying to operate on the high code laid down by Uncle Bert
years before, she had been persuading herself that what she heard
was but ignorance and evil-mindedness from the lowest of
station-hands, when lo, following it was this scene between her
uncle and his wife!</p>

<p>She wilted under the blow and longed to steal away and be lost
for ever like little Lawrence John. But actuality and common sense
called for action. Site rushed to her smitten aunt, who had
sustained no injury from the bill but was in a state of nervous
collapse. She just lay still and moaned, unresponsive to entreaties
that she should get up and lie on the bed.</p>

<p>Milly put a pillow under her head and went for Larry. He lifted
his sister onto the couch in the sitting-room. Together they
settled her in comfort.</p>

<p>"Come, Sis, you must not give up hope yet," said Larry kindly.
"You stay with her, Milly, and I'll fetch Jack."</p>

<p>Milly stepped out the door with him, a hand on his arm. "No,
Barry, don't fetch Uncle. Ile was very angry. He gave Auntie a
little push, that is why she fel! down."</p>

<p>"He mustn't carry on like that. Aileen didn't know the clog was
poisoned. Even if it had been her fault, it doesn't make it any
easier for her."</p>

<p>"It wasn't that exactly. You and I must take care of Aunt Aileen
ourselves and not let anyone notice. Uncle said terrible
things."</p>

<p>"What things?" lie demanded sharply.</p>

<p>Milly was too inexperienced to keep her counsel under such a
blow. Her face was so set and white that it startled Larry.
"Terrible things! I can't bear to go on living if they are
true."</p>

<p>"Tell me."</p>

<p>"About Aunt Aileen and Ronald and little Lawrence joint. Poor
darling little Lawrence John; if only I could find him I'd take him
right away and I'd keep him and work for him myself. I'd go to
Uncle Bert and ask him to have us and let no one ever see us
again."</p>

<p>Larry thought of the embrace on the veranda when he and Milly
looked hack; how much would it be safe to deny? "Your uncle is
driven loony by the loss of the nipper, you mustn't take any notice
of him or of anyone else till things settle down again."</p>

<p>"But, Larry, I've heard the men laughing about Uncle for a
fool&mdash;oh, it was too horrible and nasty!" Virtue and decency,
all the ground at the base of ordered existence, seemed to be
slipping away.</p>

<p>"None of it's true. Surely you know better than to give any
weight to the filthy talk of that kind of scum. Come on, little
chum, you and I must stand together and pull this thing through for
the little chap's sake."</p>

<p>The appeal to her courage and indispensability was a lucky one.
She was not in love with Larry. It was easy to dismiss the
observations she had overheard about him. They were foolish in any
case, as no one would ever think such things of Dot.</p>

<p>"I wish we could get Uncle Bert here. He would tell us what to
do."</p>

<p>"That's a rattling idea. He's a good one in any scrum. Let's
send him a telegram. The mail goes from Keba to Yass today and we
could send Long Billy or Jerry."</p>

<p>The necessity of filling the breach saved Milly from the worst
effects of her wound for the time. With Jane and the cook and Larry
she planned for the impending siege and then cared tenderly for her
aunt, forcing a little tea between her lips as a duty; Aileen had
become an unclean thing to her.</p>

<p>SP-over-J remained abroad with the men. Dice followed the same
tactics and kept away from SP-over-J. He would have given something
to know what Stanton suspected of him. A word or two overheard was
a revelation. He had felt rather smart and satisfied of just
revenge on Stanton till now the sordidness of his position was
revealed by the loss of the child. He was puzzled how to act. If
the cat was not out of the bag he did not want to be rash.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>The Milfords arrived at sunrise and leadership immediately was
theirs. They brought with them the station muster of men and Mrs
Bob Milford, wife of the elder brother, to be with Mrs Stanton.
Also with them was Ignez Milford, a bright little girl who could
ride like a cossack and sing like a thrush. They were all on
horseback and cantered up with imposing clatter of pack-horses with
provisions, clogs, whips, etc. Mrs Harry Milford had a young
infant, so Mrs Bob had sent her children to her to be safe while
she herself came abroad.</p>

<p>Harry Milford took charge. He said dingo danger could be
dismissed considering the numbers abroad, also poisoning by
strychnine by Towser's bait, or the body would have been near
about. If the child had not gone direct to the river, one of the
creeks must have accounted for him, and it was for the body that
the search recommenced. The company was divided into squads within
a horseshoe circle, the open end being the Coolgarbilli.</p>

<p>A long bright day wore away barren of result.</p>

<p>Mrs Milford, resourceful and kind, did her best for Aileen, but
could not induce her to sleep or rest. She wandered about in
pitiful fashion, evidently beyond reach of blame, sympathy, or
hope.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid for the poor little soul's reason," Mrs Bob
reported. "The suspense on her is dreadful. She seems so afraid of
snakes and hasn't thought of drowning at all. I keep persuading her
that it is too early for snakes, but it doesn't seem to reach
her."</p>

<p>"There is more in it than shows," said her husband, privately.
"Cuppinbingle Potter has been telling Harry the baby got away while
she and Dice were carrying on together, and there was a terrible
shindy between old SP-over-J and her."</p>

<p>"All a bottle of smoke most likely."</p>

<p>"At any rate, keep your mouth shut and your eyes open. They say
old jack hasn't come near her since it happened."</p>

<p>"He blames her most likely for negligence, and the rest is made
up by evil minds. Poor little soul; it is enough to send her
mad."</p>

<p>The same sort of watch was kept the second night as the first.
The following day was given to exploring the river, clear as glass
and showing every stone in its bed. The deeper holes were dragged.
It was surmised that the body had been washed into the Slate Hole,
so called for the ridge of slate rising on one side of it. It was
deep and full of snags. A swamp near by was full of tea-tree
springs and a wondrous refuge for wild ducks. A man there in spring
could fill his pockets with the ducklings, irresistibly engaging,
but they could never be tamed, and the swift Coolgarbilli was
always at hand to bear them back to their wild comrades.</p>

<p>A telegram from Poole stated he had been laid up for some time
through having cut his foot with an adze. It had been a near go and
he was quite helpless. The black trackers were helpless because of
the rain.</p>

<p>On the fourth day Harry Milford said, "No man go today where he
has been before. Going over the same ground we are likely to get in
a rut."</p>

<p>But they sought all day again without result.</p>

<p>On the fifth day he said, "He could be hidden in some little
hole covered by a bush. There's no telling where he may be."</p>

<p>"Sure, he's in the Slate Hole, an' 'tis a judgment on ould
SP-over-J for takin' the gurrul against her will. It niver pays to
have thruck wid the Divil. What comes in over the ould gintleman's
back runs away onder his belly."</p>

<p>"Not onder a hin?" inquired Paddy Leary.</p>

<p>"I reckon it's old Larry's things oughter run away under his
belly, not only the poor little Missus's," said Tim Porter. "It was
him made her marry ole Skinny when she didn't want to."</p>

<p>"Yes, an' both him an' Dice dayserting her now. Sure, that's
loife all the time."</p>

<p>Mrs Bob's brother had been lost. Mrs Milford did not remember
the occurrence, for she was the nurseling at the time. She did not
refer to the incident in Aileen's hearing.</p>

<p>"Mother missed him all her life, still does," she said to</p>

<p>Potter and a few more. "The body was never found, and my mother
always thought he might have been stolen. I believe she has not
given up hope of seeing him yet, but how could she know him?"</p>

<p>"Look at me," said Potter. "I survived after a week."</p>

<p>Mick Muldoon as a lad had been in both hunts, for Potter and
Sammy Argyll. He told an unbowdlerized version in the hut.</p>

<p>"It's not thrue that niver a thrace of little Sammy Argyll was
seen. That was made up to comfort the mother."</p>

<p>"It hasn't comforted her much."</p>

<p>"Sure, I know what I know."</p>

<p>"Old fool," muttered someone safely out of hearing. "If he
happens to be moochin' round where he can't help knowing a thing,
he thinks it's cleverness and gets so big in the head he busts his
hat-band."</p>

<p>"I heerd all about that story too," said Tommy Roper. "Everyone
knows it down the river."</p>

<p>"Spit it out, then."</p>

<p>"Let Mick tell it if he reckons he holds the patent on it. Down
the Murrumbidgee there near Broken Dray Crossing on Cuppinbingle,
the bullockies won't camp there, they reckon the baby cries there
at night."</p>

<p>"Och, you're thinkin' of ould Bowes and his woife, that was
drownded whin he was drunk and buried there, they say their ghost
can be seen there."</p>

<p>"Pooh, what would they have a ghost for? They never had anything
terrible done to them."</p>

<p>"They say the ole man walloped the ole woman something cruel,
an' she pushed him in the water when he was three sheets in the
wind."</p>

<p>"Bunkum! Mick, tell us about Sammy."</p>

<p>"Sure, he was eaten by the blacks."</p>

<p>"Eaten by the blacks!"</p>

<p>"Sure. It was a terrible dry year and ould Bowes saw wan of the
gins wid a whoite choild's arrum in her dillybag. Sure, all the men
knows it, but it was kept secret for fear it moight drive the
mother mad."</p>

<p>"I don't believe that. The blacks are not cannibals, and they're
tame."</p>

<p>"They weren't so damn' tame thirty or forty years ago."</p>

<p>"That's true; if you had seen them gathering up where them rings
is behoind Corroboree ye'd have seen how tame they were. There must
have been goings-on up there to turn the stomach of a man if they
could only be known."</p>

<p>Horror at the fate of little Sammy Argyll trailed off into a
computation of droughts and floods as milestones to fix the
year.</p>

<p>"Sure, the ould pioneers knew what loife was," said Mick. "No
sittin' round on your behoinds loike a lot of ould bins like ye do
today."</p>

<p>Sympathy was flooding towards Aileen, looking always before her
with a strained, lost look, asking no pity, seeking no comfort. Out
of decency the search was continued for a week. By that time Mrs
Bob felt she must return to her brood. The men also dispersed. They
had been there over a hundred strong, and from fifty miles distant.
As the news spread, neighbourliness dictated that men should ride
over to hear if the child had been found, and, finding the search
still on, they joined in.</p>

<p>A brake of boughs was thrown across the river at the exit from
the Slate Hole should the body rise after the seventh day. Some of
the leaders like the Milfords, Potters, and Farquharsons were
awaiting this. The lesser lights had gone. Teddy O'Mara, wearying
of the concentration, set out alone for Curradoobidgee to the
assistance of his old liege Poole, knowing that he was disabled. He
took a bridle-track seldom used, branching off from the Bool Bool
road, where his horse shied so violently that he was nearly thrown,
while his dogs rushed upon the startling object. Fortunately, they
were securely muzzled.</p>

<p>Teddy saw the child lying under a tea-tree shrub. He was the
victim of flies to a terrible degree, dirty and tattered, but
alive. He moved and raised a feeble cry. Teddy's brain helped him
sufficiently to wash the little fellow's face. He then rolled him
in his shirt and coat, and, mounting, went off hell-for-leather to
Mrs Harry Milford with the child in his arms. It did not occur to
him to return to Ten Creeks Run, seven miles behind him. Mrs
Milford had been a Miss Labosseer of Coolooluk, to Teddy a sacred
breed. He would trust the child to no one else. This was all to the
good, for from where he was, Jinninjinninbong was a mile or two
nearer than Ten Creeks and an easier track.</p>

<p>Mrs Harry rendered prompt first aid, and when the little body
was laid in comfort she wrote a note to Dr Rickart in Queanbeyan,
and to save time dispatched Teddy on the best horse left on the
place. She sent little Tommy Milford, a child of ten, on the next
best nag to take the news to the parents.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>While this had been happening at Jinninjinninbong the final
stages were reached at Ten Creeks.</p>

<p>Milly had felt it her duty to question Ronald. "What are you
going to do about Aunt Aileen?" Her severity was not alone for her
aunt's lapse, she was suffering the shattering of a girl's first
sexual ideal. A revelation, as yet but dimly realized, but
transcendental and exalting, had been desecrated. Her wholesome
innocence had left her open to an ugly shock.</p>

<p>"What have I got to do specially with your Aunt Aileen?"</p>

<p>"Don't pretend! Don't be a hypocrite! I looked back that day and
saw you on the veranda&mdash;the day when Lawrence John was
lost."</p>

<p>Ronald gnawed his moustache and spoke warily. How much had she
seen? He could not recall what his actions had been at that hour.
"I don't know what on earth you could have seen."</p>

<p>"I saw you..." She balked. "You have no right to kiss Aunt
Aileen," she finished.</p>

<p>"Great Scott! haven't I!" thought Ronald, but he controlled
himself and said, "You must have seen double."</p>

<p>"It's not only then. Others have seen at other times and talk
about it."</p>

<p>"People will always talk; that's what they think their yapping
tongues are made for." Milly was silent and so white and withdrawn
that he could not feel his way. He blundered like a man coming on
horse pickets in the dark. "Great Scott, Milly! I thought you would
be more grown-up than to make a mountain out of a mole-hill.
Supposing we take notice of the tittle-tats; supposing I did kiss
your aunt, hang it all, I've kissed you too, and was there any harm
in it? The blooming world would be depopulated if a fellow wasn't
enough of a man to take a kiss from a pretty girl now and
again."</p>

<p>"But <i>I'm</i> not married," she stammered, "and it can't be
such a little thing when it made Uncle Jack act so terribly, and
Aunt Aileen is out of her senses and talking about everything being
her just punishment."</p>

<p>Milly could endure no more. Her face growing whiter as though
she were about to faint, she turned from him. She felt need for
counteracting action and went to the kitchen to see that things
were in hand for the next meal. Red Jimmy, the surveyor's link man,
was there, gossiping with Jane and peeling potatoes. His words
arrested Milly as she approached.</p>

<p>"I dunno so much about that. What about my boss? He's no
milksop. When we wuz in Queensland we went shootin' the blacks.
When we potted the most of them, some of the gins was left and
there was a piccaninny, and the grass in Queensland is high like
reeds and we hid, an' we soon sore a gin come creepin' back, and
piff, she went! Much better fun than shootin' a few ole kangaroos,"
said the man, with a swagger.</p>

<p>Milly felt sick. This concerned a man who had spoken of love to
her on the veranda among the roses, yet he could trap a poor black
woman with her baby and shoot her: and Ronald&mdash;and Potter
too&mdash;could say those vulgar things about population, and then
want her to marry him. She had imagined wonderful things about
passion, yet passion was men, and men were this! She shut herself
in her room and threw herself on her bed in the pain of
disillusionment.</p>

<p>"<i>.I've kissed you too, and was there any harm in it?</i>."
Ronald had said, little realizing the delicate inner gossamers of
maidenliness he was rending. His one kiss had disturbed her
considerably. Her first kiss from a lover. To her it almost meant
betrothal. Into betrothal she felt sure their friendship must
progress after that electric kiss, yet he dismissed it as a
promiscuous scattering of favours, she and her unclean aunt lumped
together. And that ready phrase about depopulation!</p>

<p>When Cuppinbingle had been feeling his way with her, playfully,
jocularly, as an experienced philanderer alert to retreat or
advance as propitious, she had told him he was a wicked, bad man.
He asked why. She naively mentioned what respectable echoes she
knew of his gallantries. He laughed indulgently till his
middle-aged spread had jazzed. He smothered her in blushes and
confusion, making her feel she was an innocent baby. Inculcating
the lesson of the double standard in all its assurance of the early
nineties, he had used the identical phrase about the world being
depopulated unless, etc.</p>

<p>Milly thought that depopulation was no great matter but could
not express such heresies to a circle doing duty with a few rigid
primitive conventions in place of mutable ideas. Such notions would
earn a girl derision as being "strong-minded" and make her much
more unpopular in the marriage market than flightiness. Potter had
been an artist, laughing her out of her notions but indicating that
she was lovely nevertheless and because of them. She had turned
from him as a rake, to Ronald as a spotless white knight. And now
Ronald disclosed himself as of the same quality as Donald, whereas
Milly had kept herself unspotted&mdash;but Ronald! Who can estimate
the anguish of a high-spirited maiden when awakening to the
electrifying passion of first love to find the reptile lust
confronting her?</p>

<p>She would go to Uncle Bert and live for ever with him and never
let any man speak of marriage to her again.</p>

<p>She made Ronald uneasy as to Stanton's attitude, and what would
be the safest procedure. How the devil had the old Death Adder
acted in the sight of Milly?</p>

<p>Mrs Bob felt it cruel to leave the distraught Aileen with a
woman as young as Milly. She sought Stanton. "Mr Stanton, as soon
as possible I wish you would bring your wife to me for a week or
two. It will be necessary to give her change and company. I fear
for her reason. It will be better when it is all over...If she
would cry it would help."</p>

<p>Stanton mumbled a few words of thanks and seemed unable to
express himself, which Mrs Milford took as natural. Going from her,
he encountered his brother-in-law and rapped out, "Mrs Milford is
talking about taking Aileen to Jinninjinninbong. You can do what
you like about it, or Dice can make arrangements. I'm done with
her. I don't want any other man's &mdash;&mdash; about me."</p>

<p>Larry was thunderstruck. He had heard a word or two and was
aware that Aileen and Dice had fooled about a bit&mdash;but this!
He did not know whether to attribute it to the state of Stanton's
nerves over the loss of the boy or to take it seriously. He emitted
a soft whistle and stood on the veranda pondering, and wishing he
could see Milly, a chronic state with him. Golly, didn't he wish
old Bert Poole had not taken this time to put himself out of things
by an accident befitting a new-chum. He would have been a steadying
influence on the whole mad caboose, and the man to deal with old
Jack. Why the blazes hadn't Dice and Aileen a little more
sense&mdash;getting into a silly mess like this!</p>

<p>SP-over-J was mowing a wide swath. He encountered Dice after
leaving Larry. "You can make arrangements for removing your
property," he snapped. "I don't want her on my premises any
longer."</p>

<p>Dice did not affect to misunderstand. It was too serious for
that. He walked into the house and found Mrs Milford and asked
could he see Mrs Stanton. "I can't leave without saying a word to
her about the little chap and how sorry I am."</p>

<p>"Yes. Poor little soul seems dazed. It would do her good if you
could make her break up. She was down the orchard a few minutes
ago."</p>

<p>Ronald found her there. "Aileen," he said, going direct to the
point. "Stanton seems to be upset about you and me. God knows we
were harmless enough, but I want to say that if he doesn't return
to his senses, and cuts up rough, I'm ready to do whatever you
wish. I'm sorry for what you have been through and if I have made
things worse for you I'll do the decent thing as far as I can. You
understand, don't you? You only have to let me know."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I can't," she wailed. "The snakes are there."</p>

<p>He saw that she was for the present beyond comfort&mdash;or
further disaster. He shook her hand and withdrew, running into
Larry, who was hanging about aimlessly wondering where Milly could
be hidden. Everybody was tired and aimless.</p>

<p>"What the deuce have you and Aileen been up to? Old SPover-J has
been raising a pretty dust to me. He talks of turning Aileen
out."</p>

<p>"Let him bag his head! He can't do that."</p>

<p>"He can go away and leave her here, though."</p>

<p>"See here, Larry, the old Death Adder has got some bee in his
bonnet without any foundation, but if he is going to turn dog about
Aileen, I'm ready to do all I can. I suppose Milly will stand by
her&mdash;she's a game good girl that, all right&mdash;and you
might, as Aileen's brother, take a hand by letting me know. You
were all damn' strong on tying her up to the old mongrel."</p>

<p>"It's not as serious as that, is it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what it is with a loony old piker like that.
Aileen is so upset that she doesn't seem to understand what I am
saying to her, but you can let her know when she comes round."</p>

<p>"When all is said and done, you can't expect Jack to let you run
about with his wife under his nose."</p>

<p>"What could you expect? You locked the poor little thing up and
forced the old Death Adder on her&mdash;shot my horse under me when
I made a good straightforward offer. Serves you jolly well right
now!"</p>

<p>Larry saw that Dice was in no mood to be reasoned with, or to
climb down, and remembered his own skeleton too vividly to preach.
His present state, too, had awakened him to an understanding of
what Dice and Aileen must have gone through, without any sympathy
from him, and he said nothing to increase disharmony. "Keep cool!"
he advised. "Ten to one it will all end in a bit of a squiff."</p>

<p>They walked out the back way towards the stables together and
rode to the Slate Hole to see if the brake had detained anything.
They disturbed clouds of ducks and engaged in a scudding
competition on the still water of the Hole with flat waterworn
stories. Larry was the champion. Harry Milford was there too, and
after a while they returned to the homestead. As they neared,
little Tommy Milford came from the other direction at full gallop.
They cooced to stop him. "My God, don't let him go to the women! It
looks as if something has happened at home," said Milford.</p>

<p>The little boy, his face wreathed in smiles, shouted his good
news and held out a note. His excitement and the men s incredulity
rendered him unintelligible, but when they were sure of the news
they broke into a cheer and turned to tell everyone about the
place. Mrs Bob was commissioned to tell the mother, but it was
Milly who broke the good news, "Oh, Aunt Aileen, little Lawrence
John is alive! Teddy O'Mara found him and took him to
Jinninjinninbong to Mrs Harry Milford. Come, we are all going over
at once."</p>

<p>Aileen looked at them uncomprehendingly and broke into tears and
sobs that unnerved the men.</p>

<p>"It will save her reason," said Mrs Bob. "You just leave her to
us and get the horses saddled, and, Jane, put the meal on the table
immediately."</p>

<p>Aileen was silent and passive in the hands of her niece and
neighbour.</p>

<p>The company snatched a snack and set off as soon as Aileen was
sufficiently composed. A spirit of joy was general. A miracle had
relieved all strain and suffering.</p>

<p>All from Ten Creeks except a couple of caretakers were riding
over to Jinninjinninbong to see how the little chap was. Jane was
permitted to go too. Milly said Mrs Harry must have her hands full
with two families, two infants&mdash;one an invalid&mdash;and would
need help, In face of the miracle SP-over-J so returned to sanity
that he dispatched a messenger on the Wamgambril to bring Dr Byng
from Bool Bool to reinforce Dr Rickart. He did not ride beside his
wife. Milly did that, and since Larry rode next to her, the
decencies were preserved. Stanton rode with the Milfords. Dice
chatted pleasantly with Mrs Milford and the little Ignez.</p>

<p>The reversal of what had gloorned for days as a tragedy elated
everyone. Tongues wagged in all sorts of surmises.</p>

<p>"He must have walked straight away through the two large creeks
before the rain when there was only an inch or two of water at the
crossings made for Mrs Saunders's four-in-hand," said Harry
Milford.</p>

<p>"Sure, he's a strong choild and well set on his feet. If ye just
keep peggin' along at a snail's pace ye can go moiles in a day.
'Tis to be seen by crawlin' sheep that have to be lifted on to
their feet."</p>

<p>"He stuck to the track, that is how he got so far and kept out
of mischief."</p>

<p>None of the seekers had ridden far enough along the way the
child had gone, thinking it beyond range in view of the storm, and
none had come by it. Some never could credit that the child had
been so far as the spot that Teddy O'Mara later pointed out.
Whatever, the glad fact remained that he was alive, and it lent
high spirits to the travellers, catastrophic to the birds along the
way. The pomegranate crests of many gyang-gyangs and the tails of
half a dozen lyre-birds were offered up to Milly and Ignez. Lesser
birds like magpies, rosellas and lories, satin-birds and black
cockatoos and button-birds, were popped off in exuberance of
spirit, leaving clamorous orphans.</p>

<p>On arrival at Jinninjinninbong they found the child had had a
teaspoonful of wine drop by drop and was asleep. But for the
blowflies in ears and eyes he would have been all right. Mrs
Milford was a capable nurse, and for the remainder, the doctor was
awaited.</p>

<p>Aileen was taken to the child. She had not spoken and was quiet
now. She took one look at the little tortured face and fell on her
knees, burying her head in the bed, whether praying or not none
knew. When Milly persuaded her to rise, she looked so wan that bed
was suggested. Aileen acquiesced. The spare bedroom had been
prepared for Mr and Mrs Stanton. Larry stepped in here so
appearances were preserved. "Milly, you take care of Aileen,
there's a brick, and I'll hang on to your uncle. They have both
been through it."</p>

<p>Beds sprang up everywhere like mushrooms and half of the
visitors went to Mrs Bob, a mile distant, helping to remove her
family.</p>

<p>Dr Rickart arrived next day, followed by Dr Byng a day later.
Mrs Milford was highly commended for her first aid. The child was
progressing, moderation was what was needed. Great care must be
exercised with the ears and eyes, but even there the doctors hoped
for complete recovery.</p>

<p>Dr Byng remained some days, enjoying the good shooting and the
rest from professional duties in the famous valley and in the
wonderful gardens of the two women. There was stimulating rivalry
between them. Mrs Bob had a bed of Prince of Wales feather as tall
as maize with streamers feet long, and borders of double English
daisies and anemones, others of wallflowers, stocks, and foxgloves,
bordered with violets. Mrs Harry had beds of pinks and carnations
that smelt like heaven, and wide borders of sweet-william that the
bushmen rode miles out of their way to see and smell, and all who
ever saw those borders of sweet-william were unanimous that they
never saw any to equal them. She had also a laburnum-tree like a
rain of gold, and purple lilacs, and honeysuckle over an arch at
the entrance, and a hedge of pink roses all round the enclosure,
and two strips of fleur-de-lis, purple and white, and l ashes of
rosemary, and daffodils growing in a lawn of rye-grass, vhich Mr
Blenkinsop said always reminded him of England.</p>

<p>Aileen was too listless to speak, which was considered normal by
the medical men after the shock she had undergone. Milly was a
scarce of strength and a pleasure to all, more particularly to Mrs
Harry, who, with nothing but scrub help and her augmented
household, had her hands full. Milly was constantly thrown with
Larry, who laid himself out to be a comfort to her. Dice had
wounded her irretrievably, her Uncle Jack was out of it, and Uncle
Bert unable to come to her assistance for the first time in her
young life. Larry filled the breach with unflagging zeal.</p>

<p>Dice was one of the first to leave. He prepared for departure
the morning that Dr Rickart said there was no doubt about the
child's recovery. When his horse was saddled and his valise
strapped on, he sought Milly. "I'm going, Milly; ask your aunt if I
may see her."</p>

<p>Milly returned in a few minutes. "Aunt Aileen says to thank you,
but it doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"What does she mean by that?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. She is still very worn out."</p>

<p>"No wonder! Well, I'll not disturb her, but I want you to
understand and to let me know, if it is necessary, that I am ready
to help her in any way I can."</p>

<p>Milly regarded him so fixedly that he blushed.</p>

<p>"You're too young to understand some things, Milly, though
you're a brick, and you will let me know if Aileen needs me."</p>

<p>"I expect she will let you know herself if she wants you for
anything. I promise to give your message correctly."</p>

<p>"Thank you for that. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye." Milly turned away without extending her hand. Dice
went to Stanton. "A word with you, Stanton, privately."</p>

<p>"I don't want private or any other sort of words with you."</p>

<p>"You can please yourself, if you prefer others to hear. It was
you I was considering. I have nothing to be ashamed of and nothing
to hide." Thereupon Stanton consented to move towards the cow-yard,
at that hour untenanted.</p>

<p>"I wanted to say, that if you think you have anything serious
against your wife in connection with me, you are making a flaming
fool of yourself. After she was married I never saw her till the
child was nearly two years old. If you don't treat her properly,
and want to get rid of her, I'm just as ready to take on the job
now as I was when you cornered old Healey like a dingo in a trap to
keep her a prisoner and shoot my horse under me when I made a fair
and square offer of marriage that the girl wanted to accept. All
the world knows that, and that an old dried-up Death Adder like you
couldn't get a young woman to love you for your own pretty old
hide."</p>

<p>"Is that all you have to say?"</p>

<p>"All, except that I hope your horse rolls on you and breaks your
neck&mdash;<i>soon</i>! Have you anything to say to me?"</p>

<p>"Only that if I catch you within twenty miles of any of my
boundaries I'll blow your brains out."</p>

<p>"All right, then, see that you treat Aileen properly. There are
plenty who will let me know if you don't."</p>

<p>"You go to hell and mind your own business."</p>

<p>Thus they separated. Dice was in high spirits, feeling himself
on top of the situation as he returned to the house to say good-bye
to his hostess.</p>

<p>"I wonder if there is any truth in the things they say about him
and Mrs Stanton," remarked Mrs Harry to Mrs Bob as they watched him
depart.</p>

<p>"The difference in attraction is so great, one could not wonder,
and if people have no foundation for gossip, they'll gossip
without," replied Mrs Bob.</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm sometimes afraid they'll concoct an affair between old
Mr Blenkinsop and me, when he stays so long."</p>

<p>"I don't want much more of Mr Blenkinsop's company after what I
heard over the river. I must tell you the unexpurgated story of his
antics at the Bool Bool Show that time, as soon as we have a
chance."</p>

<p>This, till the intervals of the search, had not reached Mrs
Milford. Mrs Labosseer had not considered it Christian to tell her
daughter when home for her confinement anything beyond that Mr
Blenkinsop was inclined to drink and had to be kept out of town.
The old man was not such an ornament as of yore. His prestige was
gone and he was increasingly dependent upon the Christian charity
and hospitality of Mrs Labosseer and her daughter.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Lawrence John progressed in the competent hands of Mrs Harry
Milford (n&eacute;e Labosseer) and none so proud of his judgment
nor so justified in his faith as Teddy O'Mara. The Yass
<i>Tribune</i>, the Queanbeyan <i>Age</i>, the Bool Bool
<i>Courier</i>, and the Goulburn <i>Herald</i> all carried the
story in full, and it was the crown of Teddy's career to know that
he was prominently mentioned as Mr Edward O'Mara.</p>

<p>Aileen lost somewhat her distraught expression with the days and
could reply normally when addressed, but she never spoke unless
addressed. Milly's mother was ill content to be out of such a big
event, so came up from Turrill Turrill to take charge.</p>

<p>SP-over-J was relieved to let Lucy have her way. She
superintended&mdash;rather dictated&mdash;the return of Aileen to
Ten Creeks, and with the aid of Milly ran everything. Aileen was
like a child, which was attributed to the strain she had undergone.
SP-over-J was not unkind to her, merely indifferent, but that no
one specially noted. It was the most comfortable state of affairs
for Aileen. She had never been assertive. Stanton's notion of
throwing her out of doors evaporated. He knew the truth of what
Dice had said. Dice might have fooled a little with Aileen, but to
make a bobbery about it would expose and advertise his own failure
as an elderly husband as well as a young lover. His contracting
arteries left him less and less insurgently virile. The easiest
policy was to keep quiet and allow matters to drift.</p>

<p>Lucy Saunders advised a stay in Sydney for Lawrence John under
some eminent specialist for eyes and ears. To this Stanton agreed
if Lucy would go too and take charge, which she was more than ready
to do. Milly firmly announced her intention of remaining at Ten
Creeks with her uncle, and he was delighted to have her. Her mother
suggested several guardian-companions. To these Milly scornfully
objected.</p>

<p>"You can take care of me, can't you, Uncle, better than anyone
else?" she said, swinging on his arm, which to him was the one
bright spontaneously affectionate oasis in an arid stretch.</p>

<p>"I'll try, Milly, if it takes a gun and baits," he said, almost
jocularly.</p>

<p>"You be sure that she behaves," said her mother.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p>Norah Alfreda was developing into a wonderful child whose fond
parents had no doubt of her genius. The thought of her remained
terrifying to Larry. Norah attributed her brother's failure to
visit her to his devotion to Ten Creeks Run&mdash;and Milly. Norah
pleasured in this, for she was fond of Milly and felt that
possession of Norah Alfreda would he more secure if Larry married
someone other than Dot.</p>

<p>To Dot, likewise, the thought of the child was objectionable.
Her family never mentioned it, and should some outsider talk of the
prodigy produced by the funny old pair at Billy-go-Billy, Dot would
slip from the room. She was doing her duty invincibly as
housekeeper and nurse to her mother, who was increasingly devoted
to the cultivation of rheumatism, bunions, indigestion, and such
respectable afflictions. Advancing age was curtailing Mrs
Saunders's perpetual preoccupation with the petty mechanics of
physical existence, and having nothing mental or spiritual to take
its place, her ailments, real and anticipated, were her hobby.</p>

<p>Dot became no less aloof. The spirited young woman had grown
silent and retiring. For a time all the family had been eager to
dispose of her matrimonially, but her rigidity erected a barrier
against amorous advances. The family accepted this after a time.
"We can afford one old maid," they said. She would be indispensable
as a caretaker for Pa and Ma as they became troublesome. The old
people also foundered in this attitude. Only Dot articulated no
opinion about her past, present, or future.</p>

<p>There were still admirers. Her smart comeliness of shoulder and
waist and fair face made her desirable. Dice found the wistfulness
that had crept across her features like a veil, appealing.
Gentleness rather than courage or wilfulness always attracted him.
He was curious how so strangely different a Dot could have
developed and cock-of-the-walkily inclined to attribute it to her
failure with himself. They met at church, to which he sometimes
drove his mother, and Dot's indifference reawakened his interest.
Attributing her demeanour to pique did not fit with the difficulty
in recapturing her favour. Soon it was Dot's face instead of
Aileen's that filled his dreams and he became a frequent visitor at
Saunders Plains.</p>

<p>SP-over-J heard this with relief. Any sure disposal of Dice was
preferable to his being a devourer in the neighbourhoods of Ten
Creeks or Turrill Turrill, and since Dot had not known enough to
take her good chances, let her make Dice safe.</p>

<p>No recall reached Dice from Aileen, Milly, or anyone else, so he
flattered himself that he had retired from the field in full
possession of his spurs. "Things all right between Aileen and the
old Death Adder?" he inquired casually of Larry one day in Bool
Bool.</p>

<p>"Of course, and likely to remain so, if you don't go acting the
goat again."</p>

<p>"No danger of that. You'll never see me within twenty miles of
that zoo again unless by accident."</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>"Ronald Dice is running after Dot Saunders now fit to break his
neck," said Mrs Isaacs in M'Haffety's private parlour.</p>

<p>"Sure, thin, there wasn't anny truth about him getting into
trouble with ould SP-over-J."</p>

<p>"It was true enough, but men run round from one to the other. A
girl that sets too much store on a man is laying up sorrer for
herself."</p>

<p>"'Twould be a good way of settlin' Dot an' clearin' up the
trouble with ould SP-over-J. It's curious, if there was anny truth
in what you said of Dot, that it niver leaked out."</p>

<p>"Must have come off before its time and that's how it was so
easy hushed up. It must have given old Saunders the pip, though,
paying up for it. A thing like that is not managed without a good
sum of money. I hear Aily's little boy's eyes are likely to
recover."</p>

<p>"Sure, people was sayin' it was a judgment on her, and thin by a
miracle she's got her choild aloive."</p>

<p>"Maybe she's taken the warning and that's why she sent Dice
about his business."</p>

<p>"Oi'm surprised at Lucy Saunders not havin' more sinse than to
leave Milly up there among all those men like wolves. Sure, some
women niver learn. That's the next trouble we'll be hearin' of,
beloike."</p>

<p>Something of such babble reached Milly's ears. Her only
companion of her own sex for days at a time was Jane Humphreys,
whose notorious stepmother was not married to her father, her real
husband being occupied with "doing time" for sheep-stealing from
Brennan's Gap. The Humphreys family had a hut on a selection in the
scrub between Wamgambril and Goraig swamps, reputedly a sink of
iniquity at those seasons when Biverina shore, and old Humphreys
went down the River as slushy or odd man about the sheds. Jane was
all ears to the gossip that poured through Ten Creeks kitchen, and
Milly not sufficiently experienced or other-worldly not at times to
be interested in Jane's divulgences.</p>

<p>"They say, Miss Milly, that Mr Ron Dice is now kitin' off every
Saturday night to stay at Saunders Plains. Ain't he just a proper
lady-killer! He's such a flirt he can't help himself. He'd throw
sheep's eyes at me if there was no one else about. He is a limb!"
Giggles testified to Jane's unqualified admiration.</p>

<p>She could not understand that she was cutting Milly's heart with
the jagged edges of a broken ideal. It was one of Milly's tragedies
that no one understood. She had to work her way alone through this
crash of something vital from heaven to the mud. No one knew how
she was suffering nor was capable of understanding why. The men
would only laugh and make coarse variations of the depopulation
theme used by Potter and Dice; the women would treat it as
something in regard to men not to be cured and therefore to be
endured without vulgarity. She ached to tell it all to Uncle Bert,
feeling that his understanding would include sympathy, though even
he had failed her by absence at this crisis.</p>

<p>She kept away from Bool Bool because of the stories of Ronald's
pursuit of Dot. Flora or Rose Farquharson sometimes kept her
company at Ten Creeks, visits pleasant to both of these, who found
Cuppinbingle there too, and they were willing to overlook his
premarital gallantries so long as he would settle down afterwards.
Milly's favourites were the Milfords and she often went over the
river for a night or longer. Mrs Harry's baby was an attraction,
and Ignez, who played the piano by ear to the wonder of the
district, worshipped Milly in a way that was particularly
heartening to her just then. She adopted the little girl as her
sister and they swore eternal fealty. In imitation of herself and
Uncle Bert, Milly made a compact that should Ignez ever be in
difficulties Milly would rescue her, and the little girl sealed the
promise in a precocious and hypersensitive memory.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>At that date Uncle Bert wrote that Sparr and Leamington's circus
in its entirety was coming to Goulburn. Constable Purkis informed
him that the man who performed with the blue roan under the name of
Broncho Bill was in reality William Bowes. Poole wanted to know
what Milly thought about seeing the circus in Goulburn, for it was
hardly likely that Flash Billy would venture to Yass or
Queanbeyan.</p>

<p>Milly replied that it would not do for him to risk travelling at
present, that she might get Uncle Jack to take her to Goulburn to
see the pony herself. This letter was written to cover Milly's
definite plans. Since Poole was not available, she turned to the
eager Larry as her instrument. He was on hand like the hardy
sunflower each Sunday. She had found him the most sympathetic
companion available for weeks. He was the happiest of all by Dice's
deflection towards Dot. Such a union would take Dot clean off his
conscience and settle the fascinating Ronald.</p>

<p>Milly spoke to him one Saturday night. "Larry, I want you to do
something very important for me. I must have someone I can depend
on."</p>

<p>"You know I would do anything in the world for you if you would
only do one little thing for me."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I need a true friend like Uncle Bert who would do
anything for me out of friendship and not want this silliness in
return."</p>

<p>"You can trust me. Test me in any way you like. I can't pretend
that I want to be your uncle, but you'll find me
Johnny-on-thespot."</p>

<p>"And you won't want something in return?"</p>

<p>"No. I'll be dead square, and if you don't want me I shan't
squeal about it after."</p>

<p>Under pledges of secrecy Milly explained all she suspected about
the blue roan. Her determination was to go to Goulburn, slip into
the circus, and, if she recognized Romp, deliberately abduct her
and make home without legalities.</p>

<p>Larry could scarcely believe his ears. In his clay-dreams Milly
was constantly in some discreditable situation from which she could
be redeemed only by becoming his wife. Here without his own
scheming was a congenial adventure, for which he was eminently
fitted, and which would throw Milly into his company for two or
three days&mdash;unchaperoned.</p>

<p>He dissimulated his exultation. Milly not wanting to be engaged
to him! Whew! She might as well be married to him at once as this!
To all appearances it was an elopement: all that was unplanned was
the parson to tie the knot at the finish. He must be careful not to
alarm Milly at the beginning. He took up the enterprise with a
surety that commended him to her, and planned with care. He also
provided the money necessary, which might have been beyond Milly.
They were to ride to Queanbeyan, thence to Goulburn by train.</p>

<p>The circus was to be in Goulburn three nights&mdash;Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday. Milly, having laid her plans, told her uncle
she was going over to Jinninjinninbong to stay with Ignez.</p>

<p>"All right, you can stay over there for the rest of the week if
you like, or you can come with me to Stanton's Plains, for I have
business in Bool Bool this Saturday. But what about Jane? You had
better take her too, and she can help Mrs Milford."</p>

<p>"She was crying about being homesick the other day. You could
drop her at the selection as you go and pick her up as you come
back. She might get a bit forward at Jinninjinninbong."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well. To be safe you had better stay with Mrs Milford
till I send for you. I'm expecting a wire that might take me to
Riverina."</p>

<p>"All right. To make sure, supposing I come back a week from
Friday?"</p>

<p>"All right. Your aunt and your mother might be home by then
too."</p>

<p>The way seemed miraculously cleared. Milly rode away to</p>

<p>Jinninjinninbong with a rouseabout, as far as the boundary, to
let down the heavy slip-panel. Ignez was enraptured to see her, and
Mrs Milford warmly pressed her to stay a week. Milly, however,
explained that she was on the way to Keba to stay with the
Farquharsons while her uncle went to Riverina, and she had come by
Jinninjinninbong for the better track.</p>

<p>"Someone must go with you," said Bob Milford. Protest was
unavailing. "I couldn't let you go over that crossing alone. It's a
steep, slippery bank."</p>

<p>"If you'd just see me over the river that would do."</p>

<p>After supper they were surprised by the arrival of Larry Healey,
who said that two of his mares had been seen making towards
Boundary Creek. One of them had been foaled out towards Mount
Corroboree.</p>

<p>"Looks like a put-up job to me," said Milford to his wife. "But
I suppose it's none of our business. The girl is too good for
Larry, but if her mother doesn't keep a better eye on her, I
can't."</p>

<p>Larry spoke to put the Milfords off the track. "Are you going my
way in the morning?"</p>

<p>"I'm not going back to Ten Creeks," Milly replied. "Are
you?"</p>

<p>"Not till tomorrow night. I'm going towards Corroboree
first."</p>

<p>"Then you can see me on the way to Keba and Mr Milford need not
be troubled."</p>

<p>"Ah, Milly, you can't deceive me like that. I believe you and
Larry are eloping."</p>

<p>"No such luck," said Larry.</p>

<p>"Don't take any notice," said Mrs Milford, noticing Milly's
confusion. "The men always think we are dymg to elope with
them."</p>

<p>"You can't deny it. That's what happens all the time."</p>

<p>"Yes, when we go silly, and you don't know how many are sorry
afterwards," retorted Mrs Milford good-humouredly.</p>

<p>Larry escorted Milly next morning, but Milford went too. He was
satisfied when he saw Milly past Dingo Sideling and Larry gone
towards the back of Corroboree. Milly was permitted to go the last
ten miles to Keba alone. Behind a pinnacle she reined in and was,
after waiting, rejoined by Larry, who said he had watched Milford
genuinely turning back across the Coolgarbilli.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he was suspicious all the same," said Milly, but so
long as he did not frustrate their plans, Milford's suspicions were
what Larry desired, who cared little about rescuing the blue roan
and immensely about compromising Milly.</p>

<p>They reached Queanbeyan and caught the train. In Goulburn Larry
proposed to call Milly his sister and put up at the Commercial, but
Milly's horse sense stood to her. She had the address of a most
exemplary boarding-house where her mother had stayed when visiting
a dentist. As her mother's daughter she was welcomed. Her story
that she had come to meet her mother was also readily accepted by
Mrs Wilson. The story of the lost Lawrence John was known to her
and she was interested to hear of him. Milly said she would visit a
friend, whom she hoped would take her to the circus. This also was
plausible. Milly was a girl who won the trust of older ladies.</p>

<p>Larry, as a disguise, had a three-days' beard, which was
effectual and almost more than he could bear in contact with Milly,
but her approval was sustaining. With a slouch hat well turned down
and a dark handkerchief round his neck it would have taken a
searching glance in the shade of the tents to detect the usually
spruce Larry. He secured seats in a nook where they could hunch
behind their neighbours.</p>

<p>There was no difficulty in recognizing Flash Billy in Broncho
Bill, with his wonderful mustang from the plains of Arizona, where
on the biggest ranch in the world he had lassoed more steers in a
day than had ever been seen on the tin-pot cattle-runs of New South
Wales. So said the barker.</p>

<p>Milly was so excited when the mustang Prairie Nell appeared that
she thrilled Larry by grasping his arm. Milly had no doubts about
it being her own lost friend from the moment she entered the ring,
the carriage and contour were unmistakable to one who knew horses.
Larry was similarly convinced but desired proofs before taking
action. He did not relish the possibility of being arrested for
horse-stealing, a charge that would fall on him rather than on
Milly. It was three years now since the Young Whisker filly had
disappeared&mdash;time for her to have had a two-year-old the spit
of herself. This beast had Romp's crest and croup, her gait, and
every other point, but she had a big star on her forehead, two
white hind-hoofs, and a curious white patch on the hindquarter.</p>

<p>"That's whitewash," said Milly. "It's too white to be real. I
once made a piebald of Lady Lochinvar for fun, so I know."</p>

<p>The pony performed with mettle and precision and won the hearts
of an up-country gathering by her pluck at the high jump and
through the blazing hoops in artificial light, by the way she sat
down and lay down, and finished by divesting herself of Broncho
Bill and every shred of tackle without breaking a buckle.</p>

<p>"Aw," muttered Larry to the man in front of him, taking care to
keep out of sight, "I bet if I saddled her she wouldn't get out of
the girths so easily."</p>

<p>"No, nor me," replied the man, who happened to be Paddy Leary,
the trainer from Cuppinbingle, with just enough alcohol under his
waistcoat to render him mellow.</p>

<p>"Why don't you challenge him?" said Larry. This was all that
Leary needed. He shouted to Broncho Bill. That gentleman was most
accommodating. He made an announcement in an assumed nasal
twang.</p>

<p>"I guess an' calkerlate any gent that likes can come an' girth
this little mustang of the prairies and the result will be just the
same."</p>

<p>"All right, sonny, let me have a go at her." Leary went into the
ring, and as he passed, Larry whispered, "There's a young lady here
thinks the white spots are only put on; just find out."</p>

<p>"Right you are," said Leary, pleased by a commission from a
girl. He buckled the mare cruelly tight and wiped his coat-sleeve
on her quarter and scraped his boot on her hoof, Milly instantly
noting the white on Leary's coat and boot. It is hard to deceive
the ingrained bushman about a horse that is a personal friend. He
can usually be depended upon to recognize after two years or so a
horse he has seen only once or twice. As the points of an old
master to a connoisseur of pictures, so are the brand, age, sex,
breed&mdash;all the points of a horse&mdash;to a man reared among
them. It is also instinctive. Might as well tell a man he wouldn't
recognize his wife.</p>

<p>The right prick to her flank and Romp jumped out of her tackle
as before, and was led away amid great enthusiasm. Leary returned
to his seat and was thanked by Larry from the rear, who to explain
his curiosity said, "Those marks are put on to make her look like a
mustang."</p>

<p>"She looks damn' like the Young Whisker breed to me," said
Leary.</p>

<p>"You're right. You wait going out and have a nip with me."</p>

<p>Broncho Bill now gave place to the marvellous equestrienne,
Mademoiselle Yvonne. Prairie Nell was out of this act, and in her
place half a dozen snow-white cart- or plough-horses of wide spread
convenient for the tableaux of hoops, tights, etc. Larry and Milly
noted that it was a big act engaging numerous hands as well as
performers, and departed to take their bearings. Larry raced Milly
to Mrs Wilson's in a cab and was back again to keep his
appointment.</p>

<p>Leary was enthusiastic about Larry's plan and eager to earn a
quid or two, because he was "broke", and put to it to get back to
Cuppinbingle without walking. Larry had to make sure that Leary
kept reasonably sober and held his tongue for the next thirty hours
or so. He was calculating that Flash Billy would hardly make a
fight for the pony and lay himself open to a sentence for
horse-stealing.</p>

<p>Larry arranged for a horse-box on the Queanbeyan branch of the
train for Friday night. The squatters on that line found no trouble
in being accommodated, and Larry and Leary acted for Potter of
Cuppinbingle with convincing assurance.</p>

<p>They were to seize Prairie Nell next night while the main act
was employing most of the circus-hands. In this Mademoiselle Yvonne
acted with her greys, the clowns with their blacks, the trapeze
artists hung like monkeys from their knees above, and the
spectators were engrossed.</p>

<p>Milly left Mrs Wilson happily, that good lady never doubting
that she was to meet her mother. The night trains passed Goulburn
at such an hour that no one except of necessity met them. Milly
stole into the first half of the circus again to pass the time, and
from there was to go to the waiting-room at the railway
station.</p>

<p>Leary was again to the fore. Tonight he bet that he could ride
Prairie Nell without being thrown. The crowd took it up with a
whoop. Flash Billy had immediately recognized his fellow trainer of
earlier years, and was happy that Paddy was taking him seriously as
Broncho Bill. He was, however, uneasy, and thankful that after
Goulburn his division of the circus was to go to the northern
towns. His possession of the pony was secure in a general way. He
held a receipt showing that she had been purchased out of
Tumbarumba Pound. He had seen to that as early as practicable. A
Pound receipt for a horse was as good as a Torrens Title for land.
This information had been supplied to Poole by the police. The only
way to regain possession of the horse lawfully would be to open the
case through the police&mdash;a very tricky case, but likely to go
hard with Bowes in the end, for Milly had a hoof of the horse that
had been killed as a blind, and the circumstances of Bowes's
dismissal could be adduced. Larry agreed with Milly that possession
of Romp would most likely settle matters without further trouble.
He might as well have whistled up wind as tried to show Milly any
importance in constitutional methods.</p>

<p>With a woman's facility in leaping fusty entanglements of law
and its roundabout reasoning she had tried the case and settled it
on its merits&mdash;justly, too. There was her very own darling.
She had known from the beginning that Flash Billy had taken her. He
had played a cruel, mean trick with another horse of similar hide
to put them off the track, but Milly had not been deceived. Nearly
three years had her precious pet been in the hands of the enemy,
doing tricks for idiots to laugh at. As for Billy's silly old Pound
receipt, a wombat with a blind eye could see that that didn't
count. The impudence of that insufferable Billy!</p>

<p>Larry chortled: if Milly stood charged there wasn't a juryman in
the Southern District who would go against her.</p>

<p>Paddy Leary was thrown, to the joy of the crowd, and stood up
scratching his head and clowning rather well. His drunkenness this
time was feigned. He followed the pony out, muttering and blaming
the Mexican saddle. Most of the hands were now in the big tent.
Leary reappeared with a racing pad and his own bridle&mdash;he did
not want to render himself liable for the theft of such articles.
He insisted upon resaddling. The boy in charge thought it was all
part of the performance and watched him mount with a grin, but
Paddy was not the smartest trainer on Cuppinbingle without
something in his coconut, if it was only cunning. While the boy
stood back to let him enter in the wake of the blacks and greys,
Paddy drove the pony round the wagons and guy-ropes, and was gone
like a streak. The boy, bewildered for the moment, thought the man
drunk and the pony bolting. Broncho and the boss, all the people of
authority, were engaged. The frightened lout ran first to cooks and
understrappers; before he could get anyone to take him seriously
Romp was being led into her box on the train where a dainty supper
and cool drink awaited her, and Milly began kissing her and crying
over her like a long-lost sister. When it came to the attention of
Broncho Bill he said, "I know that bloke though he don't know me,
an' it won't be hard to get hold of the pony again." The Pound
receipt held good against Paddy and his ilk.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Larry and Milly were both in an excitedly happy state, though
for different reasons.</p>

<p>"I say, Milly, don't you think I deserve a kiss too. I'm as good
as a horse, surely?"</p>

<p>"Not so good as Romp. No man is as good as she is except Uncle
Bert, and he gave her to me."</p>

<p>Larry sighed prodigiously. Milly relented. "I really am so happy
that I might give you a kiss when we get safely home, but we
mustn't do anything silly now; I'll go back to the waiting-room so
that I shan't attract attention. I'm going to write a letter to
Billy." Larry joined her later to share a packet of
refreshments.</p>

<p>Broncho Bill's work was done and he took on the pursuit of the
thief himself. He followed the Yass road nearly out to Breadalbane,
but no one was abroad at that hour to inform him if such a beast
and rider had been seen. He had not noticed Milly or Larry, and
while he puzzled for a clue or track never guessed that Romp was in
her box at the station.</p>

<p>Paddy was hidden in the box with Romp. As the train started
Larry handed him his reward and the letter that he was to deliver.
Paddy lay low till next morning when he gave a boy sixpence to act
postman, while he popped on a "goods" and unostentatiously departed
for good old Cuppinbingle, where Miss Milly's adventure lost
nothing in the telling.</p>

<p>Milly's letter ran:</p>

<blockquote>To William Bowes,<br>
<br>
I knew you took Romp from the start and killed another horse to
deceive me. I have taken her home with me tonight. I shall tell the
police in Queanbeyan and Yass.<br>
<br>
Mildred Saunders.</blockquote>

<p>When Flash Billy read that, he knew his partnership with Prairie
Nell was ended, and firstly cursed his stupidity to have ventured
into the region, and secondly was filled with splintering regret
that he had not secured a foal. Such a prodigy could not escape
from the circus without regret from all, from slushies to stars.
Young Sparr was for enlisting the police from Goulburn to Albury,
but Flash Billy said, "No go! The Pound receipt might do for the
police, but not for that &mdash;&mdash; of a girl. Damn her for a
&mdash;&mdash;. Her people are the toffs of Bool Bool&mdash;there
ain't no flies on her. The mare and her dam was gave to her by
Curradoobidgee Poole, another geebung, him that shickercd up all
the bushrangers on his own in his day, and is still run after by
all the girls because his sweetheart, the beautiful Emily Mazere,
was drownded. Milly has only to let a squawk outer her an' the
whole flaming country would be agin us buzzing like mad blowflies.
I'll make meself scarce droving in Queensland till it blows over. I
wish I knew if they'll reely set the police on me or not."</p>

<p>"If that's the case, a walking ticket is the best thing for you,
I reckon, but any time it's safe I'll have a place for you and
another Prairie Nell."</p>

<p>Sparr was not unduly perturbed. It was not the first time his
canvas had covered a blood animal to which the title was insecure.
He considered the Southern District in general owed him something
in horse-flesh. An Arab creamy, cleverest beast ever purporting to
come from the tents of the Ouled Nayl, had escaped from his
grandfather's circus in Melbourne at the end of the forties, and it
was rumoured that he lived thereafter in the direction of the Bulla
Bulla Mountains near the New South Wales border, and had there
raised the brumby lineage. Sparr said he wouldn't be surprised if
Prairie Nell owed him something. Her quarters and staying powers
and tight-tucked belly suggested it.</p>

<p>"That won't give you no claim to her with young Milly. All the
country would take her side at onct."</p>

<p>"And that blotched brand wouldn't help you much, Broncho. It's
no use having a decent swell girl like that against you," agreed
Sparr. "Damn the women! They're a curse anyhow, but we can't get on
without 'em. A pity that girl isn't the other sort. We could have
made her an offer then, and she would be a big draw with her
pony."</p>

<p>In the nineties, girls were still of several "sorts";
professional demi-mondaines and society amateurs had not yet formed
a coalition.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Milly settled herself in a ladies' carriage, where there were
also two nuns. Larry could not intrude, so had to attend Romp and
content himself till the morrow.</p>

<p>It was a peerless summer morning of the region, with sunlight
glistening like bubbles over Queanbeyan and Canberra Plains as they
set their faces towards the panorama running round the horizon,
pinked out with the Tinderies and Tidbinbillies, blue as the sky
against which they were outlined. Over the nearer rolling widths
the spire of Canberra church came to view in its Plain, and Mount
Ainslie. Beyond that rose the ramparts of the Murrumbidgee and
Coolgarbilli ranges sentinelled at one end by black Corroboree, and
streaming on in another direction to the Bogongs, Michelagos, and
Muniongs. They rode gaily, each with a splendid beast under, and
Romp saucily trotting beside Milly at the end of a light halter.
Milly would not entrust her pet to Larry, and her glances rested on
her in pure idolatry. Larry laughed wholeheartedly at the
perfection of the creature. Her crest, her croup, her carriage, the
toss of her muzzle as she snuffed her native breezes rushing wide
from old Monaro, were satisfying to the expert. Merrily their hoofs
rang as they sped, with a saddle-bag of provisions, and a choice of
sparkling streams for the billy-boiling. Larry was highly excited.
He had determined that Milly should surrender and their engagement
be announced as the culmination of this adventure.</p>

<p>Milly was thinking rather on the same lines, though not so
happily; there was something of defeat in her attitude. Through the
fall of Ronald she was suffering a mortal wound to her first
conception of love. She had no experience at all to help her
towards knowledge that such wounds heal somewhat with time, that
men and women of ideals and sensibilities must reassemble their
house that is built without hands, and that after each besiegement
and resistance, though it may show its scars, it nevertheless
becomes a more compact edifice. The shame of the disillusionment
disrupted her, and with the headlong impetuosity of youth she
wanted to hurl something into the breach. The only thing at hand to
her unguided inexperience was Larry Healey. During the last months,
never failing, never sparing himself, by sheer assiduity he had won
her affection. Always at hand to help her with good nature and
dash, in her stricken state, propinquity had had considerable
effect. Teens could not conceive that five or even two years hence
she would marvel that she could ever have been infatuated with
Dice, or that the defection of a man so ordinary could have wounded
so deeply. What she needed just then was an understanding friend to
remove her to a change of mind and associates, whereas she was
entirely alone.</p>

<p>Marriage was the natural end of women as Milly knew them. To be
an old maid in that time and region was failure, and Milly was too
strong and wholesome to accept that. This being her state of mind,
Larry, she supposed, was as good as anyone. He would be something
tangible heaped into the chasm of her disgrace in having placed her
affections upon Ronald, her aunt's...Milly knew no word to describe
the vile and unmentionable relationship.</p>

<p>"You can nearly always hear the pheasants here," said Larry,
when they were resting on the tussocks at Pheasant Creek, awaiting
the billy for the tea. "I've sometimes seen half a dozen at a
time." As he spoke a beautiful cock bird preceded by his lady
passed down the sideling in spasmodic flight, and soon they heard
the mimicked sound of chopping. Larry was trying to come to his
point, but Milly held him off, talking about the shafts of sunlight
hundreds of feet long flickering through the vaulted roof of
gum-trees.</p>

<p>"Now, where are we going?" she inquired, as they got under way
again. "I can't go back to Ten Creeks, as Uncle Jack is away. I'm
supposed to be at Keba, but I don't like going there with
Romp."</p>

<p>"No. We can't go there and have them gabbing like a lot of old
magpies." Larry was not going to have Alistair Farquharson
intruding upon his adventure. "Let's ride through to Wamgambril
Springs and give Joanna a surprise. That will be all square for
both of us."</p>

<p>"All right. Let's go there and see the new baby."</p>

<p>"Golly, it's fun to think of old Dan as a dad!"</p>

<p>"He can't be half as funny as old Alf Timson!"</p>

<p>This was a shivering thought to Larry. He sheered off.</p>

<p>"There will be a thundering dust-up when it leaks out what we've
been up to."</p>

<p>"I don't care. Romp is mine. Flash Billy ought to be prosecuted
for horse-stealing."</p>

<p>"It's not that so much, but you and me going away together that
will make the bobbery. Every old woman from here to Goulburn will
be wagging her head and her tongue."</p>

<p>"Let them!"</p>

<p>"I don't like to think how they will blame me for getting a slur
cast upon you. Let's announce our engagement. That would choke 'em
off. What do you say?"</p>

<p>Larry was agitated under his casual phrases. Milly responded so
matter-of-factly as to indicate that she had pondered the
question.</p>

<p>"I suppose I might marry you some day, but there is no hurry."
She had been conventionally wise enough before choosing Larry-as
her partner in the undertaking to realize what it involved to her
reputation, though she had never before shown the slightest sign of
surrender. This was too much for Larry's equilibrium. He embraced
her so violently that he nearly lifted her from her horse. Milly
pulled herself free, clicked to Romp and Merrylegs, and went off at
a smart gallop.</p>

<p>"This is too wonderful to be real," he shouted, coming up with
her on a stiff sideling. Near at hand the birds sported among the
shrubs of a creek. From below, the music of the Coolgarbilli amid
its grey rocks, moss-carpeted, came up to them as it foamed on its
way to old Mother of Waters.</p>

<p>"It won't be real if you act like that before I say you may,"
said Milly, and he saw that she was not merely inciting him to
further demonstration.</p>

<p>"You must expect a fellow to go off his nut a bit under such
good news as that."</p>

<p>"I only said I <i>supposed</i> I would some day. Lots of things
have to be considered first."</p>

<p>"Let's consider 'em at once and get the thing done."</p>

<p>"What would we live on?"</p>

<p>"That's easy. Times must mend before long. I can get the
management of one of the summer runs for a start, and from that
work into a property of my own. With you to work for I could do as
much as three ordinary men."</p>

<p>"That's the chief thing that Mother and Uncle Jack and the
Uncles Saunders will think about."</p>

<p>Mention of the Saunders uncles made Larry uneasy. Could he count
on their need to keep the scandal with Dot quiet to let him and
Milly progress into matrimony unopposed? The thing was to make sure
of Milly first. Possession! Possession that could not be revoked
was what he needed.</p>

<p>"There's something I think a great deal more about than
property," said Milly, after a pause.</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Morals."</p>

<p>"Morals!" It fell like a whip-crack on the sunny afternoon,
delicious under the pendent peppermint branches that Milly reached
up and clutched now and again for the refreshing perfume and
flavour of the grey-green leaves, like silken ribbons.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by morals?" he inquired, with a laugh, but
inward confusion.</p>

<p>"I mean just morals&mdash;whether one has good morals or
not."</p>

<p>"There's nothing up with your morals, Milly my queen, and I'll
try to live up to them as well as I can, but it's not so easy for a
man as a woman, you know."</p>

<p>"I don't see why. You all say that like a lot of weak-minded
nincompoops."</p>

<p>"Not by long chalks; even the parsons know it's not so easy for
a man as a woman."</p>

<p>"I still don't see why. It's just men's excuse so they don't
have to behave themselves."</p>

<p>"You've only got to ask the doctors or read a medical book.
Golly, if it wasn't so, the world's population..."</p>

<p>Milly intimated to her horses that she wanted a spurt, and with
electrical response they raced down a gully into a streamlet, their
hoofs splashing the water over the pursuing Larry, then up a rise,
disturbing gyang-gyangs and black cockatoos. Milly was sickened by
this reiterated bleat of the men. It was disgusting that the wonder
of a lovely little baby of one's very own should rest upon such
vulgar horror. Ugh! She would not marry at all, no matter what
anyone said about old maids.</p>

<p>When it became necessary to pull rein, Larry returned to the
theme. "I don't want to hear that," protested Milly. "It was
something personal and special that I was thinking of."</p>

<p>"Let's get to the bottom of it."</p>

<p>"I hardly like mentioning it. It is so embarrassing, since one
must never go upon mere gossip," said the earnest disciple of Uncle
Bert.</p>

<p>"I never take any notice of anything I hear&mdash;lot of old
magpies with the evil minds of crows, that's what most people
are."</p>

<p>"But when it concerns my closest life, it is better to have it
cleared up."</p>

<p>"What is it&mdash;that I got drunk with the crowd the night of
Aileen's wedding?"</p>

<p>"I never heard that&mdash;you horrid dirty creature! No, it is
something different."</p>

<p>To Larry it seemed that his heart was pounding as noisily as his
horse's hoofs. Could she know anything about Dot? Surely not. Or
had someone lumped him among those who visited Mrs Humphreys at
Cherry Tree Hill? He was not going to supply further information of
his misdeeds in groping round. Why couldn't he make her understand
that the way he worshipped her made him feel like a god? Any
previous mistakes through ignorance or boyish flashness were
flooded away by what love of her revealed.</p>

<p>Milly nerved herself to the ugly thing. She looked straight
between Merrylegs's beautifully shaped ears. "Is it true
what&mdash;oh, what they say about you and Dot Saunders?"</p>

<p>The jolt was as severe as if his horse had slipped off the
cattle-pad round the sideling and landed on a ledge lower down.
Hell and blazes! Sulphur and damnation!</p>

<p>"Good God!" he ejaculated, a genuinely astounded utterance. The
Dot affair, to the best of his belief, was unknown to SP-over-J or
Dice, and yet Milly could bring it out to him on the cattle-tracks
of the Murrumbidgee ranges. If it had reached her the country must
be ringing with it, and he the only ostrich with his head in the
mud. He jerked himself together. Milly could not know the facts.
Some flirtation had come to her ears and she was
jealous&mdash;flattering and reassuring conclusion.</p>

<p>"Dot is your own cousin, the jolly smartest and best-looking
girl in the country, no matter what I am, surely no one could say
anything about her unless they were liars, and mighty dirty ones to
boot."</p>

<p>"People are liars, I know, and have no sense of delicacy, they
don't feel about things as I do, but they would surely never dare
to say such things about a woman like Dot unless there is some
truth in them."</p>

<p>"Is it about Dot only, or about Dot and me?" inquired Larry,
wary of putting his foot in a hole.</p>

<p>"If there is any truth in what has come to me, it would be a
terrible thing for you to be trying to marry me: you ought to be
married to Dot."</p>

<p>The gyang-gyangs rose in genteelish chorus, the black magpies
made music with the button-birds, bower-birds, and a hundred others
through the livelong afternoon, their notes ringing like an
orchestra along the pillared aisles of the tree-clad ranges. Larry
felt round for the right thing to say.</p>

<p>"That sounds devilish hard on Dot. Leaving me out of it for the
present, I think it's pretty low down for anyone, I don't care who
it is, to say such things. The Virgin Mary wouldn't be safe from
tongues like that, and I don't know of anyone who could get hold of
anything about Dot, she always seems to me as if she could jolly
well take care of herself anywhere."</p>

<p>"I've tried to think like that, too. I hate to give credence to
gossip, but it is a different thing when the question of picking a
husband is concerned. I wouldn't touch any man belonging to anyone
else, not even"&mdash;she nearly said, "even if I loved him," but
she felt this ungracious, and it also took her thoughts to Ronald,
whom she had loved despite his belonging to someone else and
belonging dishonestly.</p>

<p>"You can be quite at ease about Dot as far as I'm concerned. She
doesn't care a scrap for me, as I have reason to know. I buzzed
round her a bit in a calf-love sort of way while you were growing
up to take my breath away, and she gave me the cold shoulder the
same as she did to ever so many others. Dot has had plenty of
admirers ever since she put up her hair."</p>

<p>"This is different from that, too. It's this way, Larry, if it
was true I wouldn't marry you even if it broke my heart and killed
me not to; so now you understand how I feel."</p>

<p>"I think you ought to be pretty well sure on the face of it that
such a thing about Dot wouldn't be true, whatever in thunder it
is."</p>

<p>"I'm just thinking about the best way to proceed. If it is not
true, as I was saying, I suppose, well, perhaps we might as well
get married some day; but if it is true, of course I should think
it terrible for you to have dared to ask me to marry you."</p>

<p>"I'm sure as anything that anything as terrible as that is not
true, no matter what the devil it is, but how am Ito prove it to
you? The people who are ready to say things hop away like fleas if
you try to bring them up to the scratch about their lies."</p>

<p>"It will be easy to settle," said Milly with a quietness that
alarmed Larry.</p>

<p>"How?" he asked blankly.</p>

<p>"We'll get to Wamgambril Springs tonight, and tomorrow I'll ride
straight to Saunders Plains and ask Dot to tell me the truth. I'll
tell her the reason why; besides, she couldn't tell a lie about
such a desperately serious matter."</p>

<p>Nemesis threatened Larry's day and made a ringing in his ears
like the evil mess of crows croaking about a beast that had gone
clown in a gully at hand.</p>

<p>Here was a facer! Milly going to Dot in her straightforward,
compelling way would be the end of the world for him. There was but
slender hope of getting at Dot privately ahead of Milly. And
supposing he threw himself upon Dot's mercy, would she relent, or
would she consider it the greater mercy to save Milly from her
repudiated partner in parenthood? To have the filling cup dashed
from him robbed the adventure of its innocent glory, and Larry rode
in stony silence for miles considering some expedient to secure
Milly to him before Dot could confess the damaging truth. Passion
overcame him. It was sixty miles from Queanbeyan to Dan's selection
at Wamgambril Springs, and since early morning in the neighbourhood
of Canberra they had ridden without meeting or overtaking a soul.
Since ten o'clock they had not passed a habitation or gone through
a fence. The world stretched away in rampart after rampart of rock
and ridge, gully and spur of unbroken forest, with no human
presence but their own. A full eighty miles away to the one side
was Monaro and still thirty miles or more to Wamgambril or Goraig
Flats. The shadows were lengthening as they left Jinninjinninbong
and Ten Creeks to one side.</p>

<p>Larry's desperate determination hardened in the solitude. Milly
had selected him voluntarily. The Milfords had suspected a planned
rendezvous. Paddy Leary would spread the news up and down the
River. If he held his tongue till he got out of Goulburn it would
be as much as he could do. He would never pass Yass without
knocking down what remained of his fiver and in the process
blabbing as only Leary could. Larry had counted on all this in
binding Milly to him, but she was quite capable of jettisoning
scandal and defying convention after she had seen Dot. Fear of Dot
grew to panic. When night fell they were still a long way from
Joanna and Dan.</p>

<p>"You've taken the wrong track," exclaimed Milly, coming out on a
little flat where a towering dead gum, killed by lightning,
stretched a gallows-like silhouette against the darkening west. "We
are right out on the way that Uncle Bert branches off to
Curradoobidgee. We should have been there by now!"</p>

<p>"I was so happy about what you promised, I was not thinking
about the way. Oh well, let's give the nags a spell and boil the
billy' at the old salt-shed before we push on."</p>

<p>"It will make us so ferociously late getting to Joanna."</p>

<p>"Never mind. Joanna and good old Dan won't scandalmonger on
us."</p>

<p>"Others will, though."</p>

<p>"They won't know we have come all the way from Queanbeyan."
Milly was hungry and agreed to stop. Larry's idea was to unsaddle
the horses and have her in his power. Driven by his fever and his
fears, he decided she was to be his before leaving the salt-shed.
But he was only a tiro Tarquin lacking the technique to play with
his subject till the propitious moment. In his nervousness he
blundered. As the girl descended upon his shoulder he crushed her
to him, devouring her with kisses. Milly, stiff, a trifle weary,
was angered and repelled, and struggled from his grasp. She was not
the least alarmed, only resentful that he should be guilty of such
a breach of good taste and etiquette. In the course of moments it
swept upon her that a demon had taken the place of her eager,
pliant lover. This was no dream either but the reality of such a
nightmare as occasionally tormented a girl of that period reared in
the "complex" that most men were only kept from raids upon a maid's
chastity by lack of opportunity. A spasm of horror shook her. Such
a thing could not be.</p>

<p>Then Larry spoke. "Don't be frightened. I won't hurt you, and we
re going to be married. We can ride straight away tomorrow to the
parson before anyone can interfere. Dan and Joanna will help
us."</p>

<p>His voice, proving that it was merely Larry, and not some
monster substituted by the night, had an electrifying result. Had
she spoken she would have said, "You will, will you!" but no sound
came from her. She could have screamed like seven among rocks and
tree-trunks and nothing would have heard but the mopokes and
curlews, the plovers and little wallabies. The kookaburras would
have laughed and gone to sleep again. The marsupials, which had
come out to feed in the dusk, sat up, arrested by the commotion,
and hopped away. The only light was the crescent moon, going early
to rest, and for the moment placed like an ornament in the locks of
a big gum-tree. In an heroic moment fear and fatigue fell from
Milly, and her being seemed to be transmuted into a white flame of
rage that made the contest exhilarating.</p>

<p>Larry pinioned her arms and crushed her to him while she
manfully kicked his shins. They trod round wildly in the
underbrush, dry twigs cracking. With superior strength Larry wound
her tighter and tighter till she felt she must suffocate. A
movement to trip her feet with a thrust of his leg opened a few
inches of space between them, and the girl tiptoed and hit with all
her strength, catching Larry on the chin. He let go of her,
startled and outraged; he tripped&mdash;in a wombat-hole
probably&mdash;and floundered to gain his footing. Milly retained
the reins and the halter of Romp, so now her toe found the stirrup,
though high, and off she went, wildly, blindly, in the increasing
darkness. Larry had to pick himself up and reach his horse to go in
pursuit.</p>

<p>The single horse soon gained on the two, and the struggle began
all over again in the darkness, on horseback this time and
complicated by the rearing and turning of the animals. Larry's
endeavour was to pull Milly into his arms, a simple matter when
galloping from the rear and catching a girl off guard, but Milly's
practised young knees were curled firmly round the horns and the
horns were of the best workmanship. They strove together
desperately, with no word to break the stillness of that far wild
region. Not a splitter, nor a fossicker, nor a boundary-rider was
within miles, except old Billy Heffernan, the dummy, whose hut was
about two miles farther on.</p>

<p>Larry was no hardened Lothario, nor unhardened satyr. He was
sensitive and of kindly disposition, really gentle underneath his
inexperienced bravado. That inexplicable slip on Dot's part was to
blame for his wild notion that he might succeed with Milly, but he
was without the ruthlessness for such an outrage. He was too fond
of Milly, too tender towards her, and his sudden wild impulse had
passed immediately she resisted.</p>

<p>One cry broke from him, "Milly, don't panic, for no reason. I
shan't hurt a hair of your head, I swear."</p>

<p>This increased Milly's excitement, and he knew that anything he
could say would be taken only as part of his ruse to ruin her.
Milly was now out of herself with rage and revulsion&mdash;virginal
frenzy against violation. Larry had blundered so irretrievably that
both retreat and advance were now fraught with danger of complete
disaster. Horror at what he had brought on himself shook Larry, and
he could have cried to heaven to return him to the <i>status
quo</i> as it had been when he dismounted at Dead Tree salt-shed.
He was in the dilemma of his life, loving Milly as he did, and
knowing he had shut himself from paradise. His frantic necessity
now was to recapture Milly without injuring her, to calm her and
convince her that she had nothing to fear from him ever again in
this world, and thus patch up normality between them to avoid
public scandal.</p>

<p>He strove for Merrylegs's bridle-reins to render her rider
helpless. Milly attempted to rush the mare at Larry, but all the
animals were well-mannered saddle hacks, not cavalry chargers. She
tried to hit Larry's horse with the end of the halter, but Larry
easily countered that with the aid of his spurs. Suddenly Milly had
an idea. She drew a pin from her hat and jabbed at Abracadabra. She
caught him on the nose, and the spirited beast reared and backed
madly.</p>

<p>The introduction of that silver hat-pin altered the course of
their lives.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Billy Heffernan made money each season from wallaroo pelts. He
used pits to trap them, baited with wild cherry, quinces, or
damper, and cunningly covered with tea-tree. His biggest, deepest
pit was two yards behind Abracadabra when Milly jabbed him, in the
fairway used by certain marsupials as they came to browse on the
little flats or to pilfer a lick of salt. The horse suddenly
disappeared altogether. Merrylegs and Romp were too quick-witted to
follow him.</p>

<p>There was a big catch in the pit and they could be heard
scuffling and coughing. The horse plunged and snorted among them.
Milly was rigid with fright, as she quieted her own trembling
animals at a little distance. The slender moon was abed. There was
no light but the high stars, which could not penetrate the dusk of
the stately underbrush. No sound came from Larry. Milly's night
sight came to her as she steadied herself; she saw the bait
swinging above the pit and knew what had happened.</p>

<p>"Larry," she called. "Are you there?" No reply. She had no
matches. She could not see into the black of the pit. She could
hear that Abracadabra had settled down. Evidently he was not hurt;
but what of the rider, was he crushed underneath? Was he dead, or
silent only to entrap her?</p>

<p>"Larry! Larry! Tell me, are you hurt?"</p>

<p>No reply. Her terror grew painful. He was dead! She had killed
him.</p>

<p>"Larry! Larry! If you are able to speak, please do. Don't just
keep quiet and try to catch me. You won't have to go on fighting
me. If you are alive, say so, and I'll...you can marry me if you
want to as madly as that. Oh, Larry, do speak if you are
alive!"</p>

<p>She felt about for a stick with which to probe, but found only
upstanding wattle scrub, dead a year since by fire, tearing and
tough as whalebone. There was no response from Larry. Ile must be
dead! She could do nothing! She shivered with a sense of terrible
disaster as she stood a minute or two lost in the dim pillared
aisles of solitude through the rent of whose roof high overhead
twinkled a star. She looked up and recognized one of the pointers
of the Southern Cross&mdash;a treasured friend to one who knew and
loved the night. Reason returned. The spring of action was
released. She collected herself and made up her mind.</p>

<p>Watching minutely against another pit, she led her horses back
as far as the salt-shed, and from there along the track by which
they had come till she was certain of her whereabouts, and could
see all the stars of the Cross. Then she changed saddle and bridle
to Romp, who had run free all day, hugged and kissed her for
comfort, climbed on her back, pulled Merrylegs's halter, and with
calm desperation headed for Curradoobidgee eighty or ninety miles
away.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p>Dawn found the girl and her trusty friends many miles on their
way. At sunrise she toiled up the passage of the Wamgambril for two
miles or so by a precipitous track to the famous coolamon lying
like a jewel at the base of the mighty rock, where the Wamgambril
and the Coolgarbilli take their rise. Reaching the crest, she
changed saddles again and let her beasts have a mouthful of grass
while she breakfasted on the fruit of a wild raspberry vine. Then
on and on again by gully and spur with never sight nor sound of
man, not even a wisp of smoke above a distant chimney, the solitude
to her not at all distressing. The familiar birds fluttered and
made music round her all the way; even during the night the little
wagtails had never left her, tweetering all the time, "Sweet pretty
creature! Sweet pretty creature!" She knew too that Merrylegs was
carrying her safely and directly homewards. It was the other thing
that drove her unresting to Uncle Bert, the one of all who had
sheltered her ever since she had been a passionate self-willed
toddler. Uncle Bert, the great love of her infancy and girlhood,
had never failed her spiritually, and would not cast her out now.
Through the malhazard of his physical accident had resulted all
that now dismayed her.</p>

<p>The sun rose high with blistering, irradiating heat tempered
with zephyrs crisp and cool and of powerful sweep from Kosciusko,
from Cootapatamba where the eagles drink the icy water, and from
where the Snowy River rises to dash down to the lone and mighty
Southern Seas to trade its song of mountain peak and ferny gully
with that of the ceaseless winds that roam there with naught to say
them nay for a thousand miles, bringing sou'-west stories from
beyond Kerguelen or the Aleutian Deep, or sou'-easters freighted
with the weird and frozen adventures of Antarctica from beyond the
Bay of Whales, from beyond King Edward's Land, from beyond Haakon
Seventh's Plateau, from beyond the South Pole, straight from
eternity.</p>

<p>Merrylegs sweated and dried, and sweated and dried again, and
did not go so lyrically as when she left Queanbeyan on Saturday
morning. Milly changed once more to Romp, and she too sweated and
dried again and somewhat steadied her gait. The girl grew too tired
to urge the animals. She dismounted, ate the sweets in her
saddle-pocket, and, fastening the horses securely to her, reclined
in the shade of a tree and slept. Merrylegs tugging to reach a
farther tussock awakened her. She struggled up aghast to find the
sun was sinking. Still heavy with sleep she climbed into the saddle
and on without wavering, trusting entirely to the horses now.</p>

<p>Not only the ride from Queanbeyan to the Wamgambril salt-shed
and thence at right angles to Monaro on one meal and a few sweets
and raspberries had tired her, but the nights and days preceding
had been full of excitement and short of sleep compared with her
habit. The struggle with Larry had left her blue with bruises, and
two eyes as desperately black as any maltreated wife of Sydney or
London slums ever exhibited to a police magistrate.</p>

<p>To the fearless girl of robust physique, acquainted with the
track and bred in the saddle, it was not such a stupendous journey,
especially with a change of perfect horses and on their own beat.
Her sleep had delayed her two or three hours, and she walked
occasionally to relieve stiffness, but by midnight on Sunday,
Merrylegs pricked her ears and mended her pace and Milly discerned
by the light of the stars the stone fences marking the bald plains
of Gowandale and Eueurunda, and knew she was on the buggy-roads
that led from one to the other. Another ten miles to
Curradoobidgee. She manipulated the different models of gates and
slip-rails employed by Miss M'Eachern and the Pooles, and there at
last was the song of Poole's Creek coming like the wind from
Eaglehawk, and Merrylegs conducting her straight to the stable door
of the old homestead.</p>

<p>She got stiffly down, feeling as if the bones had crumpled in
her legs. Merrylegs stretched and shook herself thankfully. Her
rider threw halter and reins over the horseshoes on the stable wall
and sought Uncle Bert.</p>

<p>The commotion among the dogs had awakened him, and he always
gave ear to the dogs since one night in his youth when he had
ignored their warning and in the morning found his famous Black
Belle mutilated.</p>

<p>Milly came timidly round the low old veranda encumbered by a
motley collection of pot-plants, and darkened at the eaves by roses
and other vines. Such a light step puzzled the listening man. It
did not belong to any man he knew. Milly tapped lightly on his
door. "Uncle Bert, oh, Uncle Bert, are you awake?"</p>

<p>Poole doubted his ears. "Just a minute! Is it really you, Milly,
old chum, or a dream?"</p>

<p>He seized his crutches and, casting on a garment, hobbled to the
door. Milly entered, distraught, disarrayed. Poole lit his famous
lamp with the incandescent wick and was aghast at his young
friend's appearance. Her habit was sweat-grey, muddy and torn, her
hair wild, her face black and greenish round the eye-sockets and
down to the cheek-bones, and stained with blood from Larry's chin.
Only catastrophe could explain her arrival at such an hour in such
a state.</p>

<p>"Is there anyone with you?" he asked gently, putting his arm
about her and easing her into a chair.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"How far have you come?"</p>

<p>"From Queanbeyan to Wamgambril salt-shed and then on from there
alone." Poole suppressed comment. He had removed her hat and was
softly sponging her face.</p>

<p>"You had better rest a moment."</p>

<p>Milly became excited. "Oh, Uncle Bert, a terrible, terrible
thing has happened. I have killed someone."</p>

<p>A serious accident, he estimated, but where&mdash;near enough to
render speedy assistance? "An accident..."</p>

<p>"No. Not an accident exactly. It was, Uncle Bert&mdash;it was
Larry Healey. Uncle Bert, I can't tell you! He tried to do
something terrible, something he oughtn't, something worse than
being killed, to me...Oh, Uncle Bert..." She looked at him mutely,
nearly collapsing with fatigue and distress. He put his arm round
her comfortingly, a glass of water to her lips.</p>

<p>"He only tried, he didn't succeed, did he?" said Uncle Bert,
calmly, soothingly, as Charlotte, his sister investigating a family
stomach-ache, but his thoughts bespoke no health to Larry
Healey.</p>

<p>"I fought him, Uncle Bert. I fought and fought till I couldn't
struggle any more...oh, I don't know, I got on to Merrylegs and got
away and he came after me, and we fought again on horseback, and I
made his horse rear backwards, and suddenly he entirely
disappeared."</p>

<p>"Good luck!" thought Poole, but he only gave her another sip of
water and wiped her face.</p>

<p>"It was horrible in the dark. I got off and poked round and
found he must have backed right into that monster wallaby-pit of
Billy Heffernan's. There were sounds of all sorts of things, and I
could hear Abracadabra, but no sound of Larry...I called and called
to him and promised him everything...even to marry him as he wanted
me to, if he'd only speak, but there was no sound, not even a
groan. I couldn't find a stick in the dark, and it seemed so deep
down...Oh, Uncle Bert!"</p>

<p>"You needn't worry about him. He's all right."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I've killed him!"</p>

<p>"Buckley's you have of killing a fellow like that with anything
less than a charge of dynamite. 'I should smile!' as the Yankees
say." Milly threw her arms round him, her weary head pressed tight
against him.</p>

<p>"Uncle Bert, promise that you'll hide me here for ever and ever,
and never let anyone see me or take me away to be hanged." She
shuddered convulsively. "Don't let them drag me away where everyone
will gape at me...Promise me you'll shoot me yourself before you'll
let them hang me."</p>

<p>"I promise that you will never be hanged for that, Milly, old
chum. Larry is the only one in danger there." Oh, to take this
sorely pressed young creature in his arms, to be his own, to keep
and comfort and protect for ever! Ah, that youth had gone! He could
never know its joys again...But he still could be a protector. It
was to him she had come all that way through day and night alone
for refuge.</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Bert, you'll keep me always with you. This would
never have happened if your foot hadn't been cut, and you could
have come when I wanted you ever so badly."</p>

<p>"Hard luck that, all right, Milly, old pal. But we'll soon put
the pieces back in their places, and things will be mended so that
no one but you and me will know where the cracks were." Milly clung
tighter about his neck, comfort in his presence. "Now, will you
promise to do just what I tell you?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, if you'll only keep me tight beside you all the time so
no one else can get at me."</p>

<p>"Yes, you shall stay safely here; but mind, you must be as
obedient as my old collie sheepdog. Do you promise&mdash;honour
bright?"</p>

<p>"I promise, Uncle Bert."</p>

<p>"Well, you just rest a bit and get your wind, there's a brick!"
He settled her in the chair and went to prepare a bath, etc.
Returning in due time he banded a towel and one of his own
garments. "There, now. You get into the hot water and then come
back to bed to the room next door to me."</p>

<p>Milly obeyed, and when she returned found a light meal with a
cup of cocoa awaiting her. Persuasion induced her to eat while
Uncle Bert, unpractisedly, brushed her tangled locks. Tenderly,
worshipfully, he recognized what a wonderful, what an exquisitely
precious being a girl was. He too had been young once, young as
Milly, but he remembered himself only as a big gawky animal very
different from this delicate and fragrant embodiment of life.
Youth, he pondered, so full of vague discontent and restlessness,
what a roya! thing it was! He insisted upon the cocoa, which had a
stick in it.</p>

<p>"Now, when you wake, you'll find a letter under your pillow. You
read that before you say a word to anyone&mdash;promise!"</p>

<p>"Promise&mdash;honour bright!"</p>

<p>"I may not be here in the morning."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Bert, you are not going to leave me?"</p>

<p>"Only for a little. I want to get to that wallaby-pit ahead of
anyone else. You see the sense of that, don't you?" Milly nodded.
"You stay here quietly and say nothing. Spend a couple of days in
bed. No one will know you are here, or why. You will be quite safe.
You can say you ran against a tree to account for your black eyes.
Here's one of the girl's dresses and you can go to Ma's room and
forage in the big chest-of-drawers. Don't tell anyone what you told
me about Larry&mdash;promise?"</p>

<p>"Promise&mdash;honour bright!"</p>

<p>"Fine! Now you just see how you can keep a shut mouth&mdash;no
flies in or out&mdash;savvy? Good night! Sleep tight!"</p>

<p>He left her to the drowsiness perceptibly rising upon her.
Finding Romp as well as Merrylegs in the stable-yard he knew there
was an earlier chapter to this story. Automatically he felt the
beasts' withers and legs. They were as fit as fiddles and a long
way from knocked up. He awoke M'George, who, with his wife, had
been secured to run the household since old Mrs Stepmother Poole's
passing&mdash;as worthy and reliable a pair as ever came frae
bonnie Scotland.</p>

<p>"Run in the Ace of Spades and Queen Anne and put my saddle on
one and get my stepmother's saddle from the storeroom and put it On
the other," was his surprising order to the sleepy man. Mrs
M'George was soon about too, and was instructed to fill
tucker-bags, etc., while Poole dressed and applied himself to a
couple of letters.</p>

<blockquote>My Dear Little Milly,<br>
<br>
Remember your promise to say nothing of what Larry attempted.
Everything will be all right. Mrs M'George will do everything for
you. Wait quietly where you are, you will be quite safe. Do nothing
till you hear from me, no matter how long that may be. Don't worry.
Miss Mac will keep you company.<br>
<br>
Yours truly,<br>
Uncle Bert.</blockquote>

<p>He signed this, regretting that his years made any other role
foolish for him.</p>

<blockquote>Dear Friend Jessie,<br>
<br>
I can depend on you, I know. Will you come straight back here and
stay with Milly till my return? It is urgent and I know you will
not fail me. An accident has happened which I have gone to clear
up, and the less said the sooner mended, that is why I have sent
for you to put the tin muzzle on all talk from the scratch. I shall
explain when I come back. The quieter Milly is kept the better. I
advise a couple of days in bed and squabash all curiosity about her
if anyone comes round. You can rely upon the M'Georges.<br>
<br>
Yours truly,<br>
Bert Poole.</blockquote>

<p>He put the first of these under Milly's pillow. She was sleeping
soundly as he had often seen her sleep in childhood; many a time as
a little thing she had had a nap on his waistcoat. Her head was
bent, her long plaits spread across the pillow. He put her in a
comfortable position, tenderly, reverently&mdash;ah, what an
exquisite thing was youth! Only those that were young could meet it
on an equality, or those who were mad or depraved seek to sully it.
He laid her habit and hat tidily on a chair so that a disordered
room should not discredit her; he extinguished the lamp and went
out.</p>

<p>Mrs M'George had breakfast waiting while M'George had the fresh
horses saddled and the two travellers washed down and turned into
the orchard. It was plain to the pair that something out of the
ordinary had happened, but they were too well trained to
comment.</p>

<p>"M'George, take this letter to Miss M'Eachern at once. She will
come back with you. I may be away four days or so. Tell anyone who
inquires that you expect me any day. An accident has resulted in
Miss Milly completing her journey alone, but don't worry her. She
is only tired."</p>

<p>"Verra guid, sir."</p>

<p>Poole mounted with some difficulty and rode away under the
stars. His foot was far from fit for a long session in the stirrup.
He cursed to think how he had failed Milly, failed adventure,
failed romance and his own reputation by two blunders excusable
only in new-chums: one by being asleep about the beast killed at
Gyang Gyang Gully, and again by disabling himself with an adze, he
whose skill with the subtle instrument was acknowledged from Monaro
to the coast. He must be getting bats in his belfry, he
reflected.</p>

<p>He prepared for this journey with ingrained resourcefulness. The
side-saddle and a sling made from a sheet were to rest his wounded
leg. Dawn found him well on his way. He looked round the sweeping
plains and rolling uplands, khaki-coloured under the splendid
summer sun, and away to the north-east over the ranges blue with
distance, ridge on ridge, gully after gully like pleats, peak by
peak, creek by creek, which he must conquer before another dawn. He
set his teeth as his horse heaved and propped on some of the
precipitous tracks, determined to reach the wallaby-pit with
minimum delay. A generation had gone since he had turned his
horses' heads that way with a sense of adventure sharing his
saddle. Today that inspiriting colleague had returned. Never had
she beckoned with more allure. Was he through age and accident to
fail? Not if he knew it. It came to him in the stimulating morning
air that vigour and joy of life were not entirely a matter of years
but also a state of mind.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Miss M'Eachern read the note handed to her by M'George and said,
"Go to the kitchen and have some breakfast and I'll ride back wi'
ye."</p>

<p>She sat down to her own meal, remarking to her overseer, "Poole
has some steers on Curradoobidgee that he wants me to look at. I
might as well go straight back wi' his mon and you can carry on
till I come back. Have the mare saddled."</p>

<p>She cantered away with M'George, leaving a curious employee.
"She'd ride through hell to see a bargain, but there's something
skew-whiff somewhere or she wouldn't scoot off like that with
shearing half-cooked," he commented.</p>

<p>She arrived at Curradoobidgee while the forenoon was only
half-blown, and Milly still soundly asleep.</p>

<p>"I've keeked in once or twice," reported Mrs M'George, "but the
pair young leddy is verra tired."</p>

<p>A thin time loomed ahead of Jessie M'Eachern: she had brought no
sewing, she never read a book, there was no one with whom to ha'e a
crack, and shearing imminent back at Gowandale. She had, however, a
true-blue understanding of friendship and buckled to its demands.
After inspecting the house and premises she settled on the veranda
with the Sydney Morning Herald, the Town and Country Journal, and
the Stock Breeders' Gazette.</p>

<p>Milly in time awoke to the recollection of the tragedy hanging
above her. Poole's instructions came back to her. She found the
letter like a treasure. Uncle Bert would not fail. Tile mention of
Miss M'Eachern worried her. Bother her, thought Milly, but Poole
had requested her presence as a witness of the girl's condition in
case of need.</p>

<p>Seeing her charge was awake, the good squatteress entered the
room. "You're very tired. Stay there while I bring you a bite."</p>

<p>This startled Milly as almost indecent. She had never been ill a
day in her life and had never seen a woman lie up except for
childbirth or measles. "Oh no, Miss M'Eachern, I'm ashamed to be so
lazy. I'll get up at once."</p>

<p>She twisted from under the bedclothes, finding herself almost
too stiff to stand. Her bare legs astonished Miss M'Eachern by
their bruises, black as if painted.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, lassie, but your legs are nothing to your face.
You must have had a terrible fall."</p>

<p>Milly rolled up the blind and went to the little looking-glass.
"I didn't know it was like that."</p>

<p>"It's a miracle you weren't killed."</p>

<p>Milly gave way to tears. "Oh, Miss M'Eachern, it was terrible!
Larry Healey and I were bringing my horse home, the one that was
lost, and it was dark, and an awful thing happened. Larry
disappeared, horse and all, out of sight. I could hear the horse
but not a sound from Larry, and I could not see in the dark, so I
came straight on to Uncle Bert, and perhaps Larry is killed."</p>

<p>"Now, you mustn't get excited. If your Uncle Bert has gone to
see, nothing can be done till we hear from him." She thought Milly
must have hit a branching tree or fallen on her head, but wondered
more what Mrs Saunders could mean to allow a young girl to roam the
bush so far from home with a fellow like Larry Healey. It was plain
that the girl herself was innocent. Lately, the Ten Creeks people
had lost their child and had all the country in all uproar. Some
folks were so feckless that they attracted calamities, reflected
Miss Jessie, while others were called in to clear up the mess in
spite of having concerns of their own demanding attention.</p>

<p>"We must bide a wee for Uncle Bert...How is the little boy who
was lost?"</p>

<p>"Mother and Aunt Aileen have him in Sydney under the
specialists."</p>

<p>"And who was looking after you?"</p>

<p>"Uncle Jack was there, only that he had to go to Riverina, and
then Larry and I went for the pony."</p>

<p>"Ah!" commented Miss M'Eachern. Without doubt some people made
their own troubles. She did not pursue the subject of where Larry
and Milly had been when the accident occurred. She was more
interested in Aileen and Ronald, seeing her connection with the old
affair, since which she had heard whispers of scandal. After a few
observations she astutely gauged that Milly was aware of the
relations between her aunt and Dice and was filled with resentment,
so decided that silence on all doubtful subjects was the safest
course.</p>

<p>An hour or two and Milly had recovered sufficiently likewise to
be suffering from inaction. She repaired and cleaned her habit, and
at midday dinner made a suggestion, "Would you let me go back to
Gowandale with you? You must be busy, and Uncle Bert can't possibly
be home tomorrow or even the next day."</p>

<p>This was rescue to the business woman oppressed with idleness
while the active affairs of her station were in full cry. "Are you
fit to ride? What would anyone say if they saw your face?"</p>

<p>"I can comb my hair low and put on a thick veil and the ride
will take the stiffness out of me."</p>

<p>Miss M'Eachern estimated that it would create less curiosity for
her to have Milly at Gowandale than for both of them to be at
Curradoobidgee at the busy time of the year, while Poole, bad leg
and all, had gone on an unexplained journey. So long as Milly was
not out of her care, her part would seem to be fulfilled. Soon they
were skimming across the rolling plains swept with Kosciusko's
zephyrs, little amiss with Romp or her mistress.</p>

<p>Poole, in another direction, progressed stubbornly and in grave
discomfort if he left his foot in the stirrup for any length of
time. To ride sideways and rest it in a sling was a relieving
change, but the new and cramped position was painful to a man of
his years, and he experienced the discomfort known to new-chums,
but pushed on, hoping to reach the wallaby-pit in daylight.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>The day that Milly and Larry left Queanbeyan, Billy Heffernan
struggled back to his hut at Wamgambril Flats and slept all that
day and Sunday. He had been away on one of his sprees by which he
periodically leavened life. He generally started in one of the less
pretentious hotels in Bool Bool, now a five-pub town, and when, for
the general good, thrust out of this, retreated to a lonely shanty
between Brennan's Gap and Melacmelac, where they had no scruples in
topping off a pickled boozer with pain-killer or any other
preservatives available at less expense than reputable alcohol.</p>

<p>On Monday he went round his traps, neglected for nearly a
fortnight, and was astonished by the catch in the big pit near the
salt-shed. It was thirty-six hours since Abracadabra and his rider
had adventitiously hurtled in there to the dismay of the other
captives. The horse was uninjured, for the sides of the pit were of
clay, but he had unseated his rider and struck his forehead and
rendered him unconscious. Larry had fortunately been pitched into
the corner of the pit, and the horse, in the way of his kind, did
not step on him again, but after the first flurry among the
wallabies settled down like a beast in a stall.</p>

<p>Larry returned to consciousness in time, but was in great pain
with a head too bad to mount his steed and thence out of the pit,
small effort to anyone in normal condition. He was in no state to
speculate on what had become of Milly, but lay against the cool
earth, taking no cognizance of time, dozing or semi-unconscious,
till Heffernan had found him.</p>

<p>To drunkenness Heffernan attributed such a mishap to a bushman
as familiar as a boundary-rider or brumby with every track of the
area. He ascertained that Larry was alive, and set about getting
him out, a neat little chore to a man as shickered as Heffernan,
for Larry was helpless. He hoisted Larry on his (Heffernan's )
head, and rolled him out on the bank. Larry groaned deeply.
Heffernan then laid his patient on a bed of bracken and brought him
water in his hat and left him to rest while he dug a slope so that
Abracadabra could scramble up. During these operations he came upon
a veil in shreds some yards away on the dead wattle shrubs, and,
just at the edge of the pit, a lady's hat-pin in the design of a
Scottish thistle.</p>

<p>Heffernan began to pleasure in his work. The hoof-prints
squirmed round in rings near the mouth of the pit, that was clear
by the trampled scrub. There had been no rain and no other
travellers, the wallabies had been diverted from this beat for the
moment and left the writing uncrossed upon the trail. Heffernan
followed the tracks back to the salt-shed, where he found another
piece of veil on a bush. The tracks of Abracadabra were upon the
tracks of two smaller horses up to within three yards of the pit.
There had been pursuit, overtaking, and a scuffle in which Larry's
horse had gone over the edge; there was, too, a small footprint
about the pit and tracks of two departing horses. There was a woman
in it and two men&mdash;a fight over a female! It was as plain as a
typed address to the bushman. What could be more enlivening to the
unbroken solitude of Wamgambril swamps! Billy Heffernan's eyes
glittered.</p>

<p>He gloated on the hat-pin and tattered veil, which would unravel
the scandal. Had Larry been scratching about the Humphrey
camp?&mdash;no, there would be no need of a scuffle about such a
trull, and this was a swell hat-pin. It might have been two women
fighting like cats over Larry. Billy dismissed that possibility
with a guffaw. Larry had not the spondulics, and without it was not
so blooming fascinating that the women would be scratching their
eyes out over him. Now he thought he had it. Larry had his tongue
lolling out after young Milly at Ten Creeks, and Dot at Saunders
Plains had got hold of it and let fly: if what he heard of Dot had
any stuffing in it, that is just what had happened. It would be
easy to get the pieces to fit.</p>

<p>Billy, whose opportunities of vindicating his red-bloodedness
had been restricted, was filled with obscene envy of a man who
could undermine two young geebung females so that violence ensued.
"Reckon these gewgaws will be worth a tenner at the least," he
muttered, stowing them upon his person.</p>

<p>His plan was to deposit Larry with his sister Joanna about ten
miles distant. Heffernan had no vehicle. Single-handed there was
nothing but packing on horseback along the cattle-tracks.
Abracadabra was too spirited for this, so Heffernan returned to his
hut for a tame old pack-horse warranted to resent no burden from a
dead beast to a hen-coop. He provided pillows for pommel and croup
by filling two sugar-mats with tussock grass. Larry was not heavy
and Heffernan a hardy, powerful old man. He lifted the groaning
form on. The pain brought back consciousness. Larry complained of
his head first. Heffernan soused that with cold water. Larry was in
such agony that he could not lean forward even on the grass, and
Heffernan had to abandon his own nag and walk at the stirrup and
bold his injured man on.</p>

<p>It was tedious for Heffernan. It was torment for Larry, but,
like many another pilgrimage where necessity dictated, it continued
and ended at last. In good time really, Heffernan was calling for
Spires to help him with his burden.</p>

<p>Dan was out on the selection. Joanna, not yet strong, had to do
her part, while Susie, a Humphrey of more doubtful parentage even
than usual, but a brave little pioneer bush maid in spite of her
begetters, was dispatched on Billy's horse to bring the boss.</p>

<p>Joanna cut away her brother's clothing and Billy laid him on the
only spare bed, the long home-made sofa in the front room, narrow
and not very comfortable. Joanna washed some more of the clotted
blood from his face and exposed the gash in his temple where the
shoe of Abracadabra had caught him and left a brand til! the end of
Larry's days.</p>

<p>When Dan appeared Larry was again unconscious from pain and
fatigue, and Joanna too alarmed to be left alone with him. Susie
was therefore sent to fetch her old tyke of a mother, who had
diverse uses in conditions so sparsely furnished with women.
Heffernan volunteered to go for the doctor. His offer was accepted.
Dan estimated that as he had just recovered from a spree he could
be trusted to pass the Travellers' Rest going, if not returning. He
had given Joanna an account of the finding of Larry suitably
expurgated for a respectable female, the sister of the injured and
with a young infant. He added a few more particulars to Dan, but
slyly guarded evidence that might be profitable or entertaining
only to himself.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>After a weary and painful journey, Poole hove in sight of the
bleak limbs of the big dead tree just about sundown. He had been
compelled once or twice to soak his injured foot in cold water to
relieve the nervous irritation set up by the pendent position. He
was out of condition by long inactivity and nearly asleep from
exhaustion.</p>

<p>The pit was empty but it was patent that Milly had not been
hysterical nor had she lost her bearings in the dark. The tracks
all about proved that the horse had been taken out of the pit, but
not that Larry was safe. Where could he be?</p>

<p>Poole had made haste against darkness. Heffernan's tracks were
fresh and he took them to the hut. The place was locked up, but
Larry's horse was in the little brush paddock. It was now too dark
to see whither Heffernan had gone. What to do? The kookaburras
could not advise though they laughed like mad all round the
horizon, and though the friendly willy-wagtails had been with him
all the way, all that they could say was "Sweet pretty creature!
Sweet pretty creature!"</p>

<p>Would they be missing Milly at Ten Creeks and raising the
country? Would Heffernan have taken Larry to his sister? Every mile
with the condition of his foot loomed like ten to Poole. He decided
to go to Dan Spires first, and this happened to be also on the way
to Bool Bool, and without major peaks to be scaled. Hearing a
horseman coming towards him, he dropped his foot into normal
position and met SP-over-J returning from Stanton's Plains.</p>

<p>"Good day, Bert, been to Ten Creeks?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't have found anyone at home. The Missus and Lucy are
still in Sydney and I sent Milly to Keba till I go for her next
Friday. Your foot all right again now? Have you heard of the
accident?"</p>

<p>"What accident?"</p>

<p>"I met Billy Heffernan going for the doctor. Larry, horse and
all, went into the wallaby-pit up this way and was there till Billy
found him."</p>

<p>"No danger of his life, is there?"</p>

<p>"Billy wasn't too clear. Seems pretty badly smashed up. I'll
come over tomorrow and see what the doctor says...I haven't seen
you since you cut your foot, how is it?"</p>

<p>"Not well by long chalks, that's why I have the side-saddle. I
had to get over to see you."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you send for me when your foot is like that?"</p>

<p>"There wasn't time. I say, Jack, Milly is not at Ten Creeks. I
left her at Curradoobidgee."</p>

<p>"How in thunder did she get there? What's up?"</p>

<p>"It's part of this accident with Larry. I haven't got to the
bottom of it myself yet, but they must have been somewhere and got
the Young Whisker filly that was supposed to have fallen over the
ledge at Mount Corroboree and in the dark Larry stumbled into the
pit. Milly couldn't get a sound out of him and was frightened out
of her wits, and, since you weren't home, she cut away to me."</p>

<p>"That was a thundering long way. She could have come to
Stanton's Plains...only I told her I might be going to Turrill
Turrill. Is there anything the matter with her?"</p>

<p>"No, only frightened&mdash;naturally."</p>

<p>"Her mother ought to look after her more."</p>

<p>"I came straight on to find you and see about Larry and not make
any more talk than necessary."</p>

<p>"We had better go to Dan's straight away, then."</p>

<p>They rode silently. Poole was in such misery that he had to
dismount and relieve his position again, so they boiled the billy
and had the evening meal from their saddle-bags.</p>

<p>The doctor found several broken ribs and a smashed collar-bone
to account for the intense pain Larry suffered, and it was
necessary to put a stitch or two in his temple. The blow there had
come within a fraction of an inch of being fatal. Mrs Humphreys had
arrived to assist Joanna, and since he could be of no assistance,
Poole said he would push on to the Travellers' Rest. He heard with
immense relief that Larry was in no danger of his life.</p>

<p>"I don't know what Lucy will say about Milly," said her uncle.
"You might send her down to Goulburn by train and she can pick her
mother up there. They may be coming on Thursday."</p>

<p>"What about the horses?"</p>

<p>"She'll have to do without them and ride Flea Creek if she
carries on like this&mdash;too much of a good thing, damn it!"</p>

<p>"A month or two on Monaro would do her good. Lots of young
people up there among the Pooles and Timsons. She can have a flock
of them at Curradoobidgee if she likes, and my housekeeper will
take care of her. I can't take this ride again for a while, I can
feel. Besides, it's shearing. Why don't you come up for a spell? I
don't know when you were up last."</p>

<p>"Wait till Lucy hears of it! She'll put Milly's hat on straight
for her, I expect. She's much too wild."</p>

<p>"You can't expect to tie young people up nowadays like when we
were young. They won't stand it."</p>

<p>"Don't let Milly be a nuisance to you. She's not a child now,
and ought to settle down."</p>

<p>"She'll never be a nuisance to me."</p>

<p>"Marriage would settle her."</p>

<p>"There is no one good enough for her...If anyone is coming in to
town tomorrow you might send me word how Larry is getting along.
I'll be going up past Neangen and could let his family know. I'll
be putting up at Three Rivers."</p>

<p>Poole's first care was a telegram worded to set Milly's heart at
rest. His foot was so painful that a couple of days' complete rest
was imperative. He spent these at Three Rivers with Charlotte and
the old lady, who were glad to see him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p>Poole persuaded Charlotte to return to Curradoobidgee with him
for Christmas. In view of Milly's probable sojourn there he felt
that his sister's presence would mean much in applying the brakes
on what his years would make a foolishness.</p>

<p>For Charlotte to be absent from Three Rivers, where she had
moved in with her family shortly following the death of Grandpa
Mazere a quarter of a century before, created a mild sensation.
Charlotte had always been there like a rock of refuge not only for
the wide family circle but for many outside it. Others might bewail
their misfortunes, Charlotte never. There was demur because it
might be Great-grandma's last Christmas, but Poole pointed out her
last Christmas had been expected for years. He believed she was
good for a longer spin than Grandma Poole, and would have at least
four or five years to play with yet. Such fears were not uttered in
Great-grandma's hearing! She urged Charlotte to have a change and
visit old haunts.</p>

<p>Poole borrowed a buggy-and-pair, and two days later he and his
sister set out. Charlotte had to drive most of the way because
Bert's foot was not fit for the brake. There was now a road cut
round the sidelings of the Jenningningahama, up which horses could
travel with less of old-time effort, and down which vehicles went
comfortably with a tree attached to the back axle to relieve the
strain on hocks and brakes and breeching.</p>

<p>There was more melancholy than pleasure to Charlotte Mazere in
traversing that road on which she had not been farther than
Bookaledgeree since, as a young wife, she had come a-horseback in
winter by the hazardous bridle-tracks in the discomfort of
impending motherhood.</p>

<p>They made to Neangen for midday and found Healey and his wife
about to set out for Wamgambri! Springs.</p>

<p>"Larry's so hashed about that it's going to be a long job," said
his father. "So I'm taking the Missus over to help Joanna."</p>

<p>"He'll never be able to walk again, and the nursing of him is
breaking Joanna down, very likely be the death of Joanna too." Mrs
Healey set her voice in the key of a dirge. Like many ageing women
of small mental capacity she revelled in disaster. It was to her
what a spree is to an old man&mdash;an outlet.</p>

<p>"Julie is to keep house, I suppose," said Charlotte
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"It is not right to leave her alone, but it can't he helped. I
have more than my share of sorrow, first Aileen's baby is lost and
now poor, poor Larry to be a cripple all his life."</p>

<p>"It was Aileen and Larry had the trouble, I should say,"
interposed Julie unsympathetically.</p>

<p>"Yes, the baby was found all right. Let us hope Larry's case
will be equally wonderful," suggested Charlotte.</p>

<p>"Many a smash-up is not so bad as it seems when we set things
together," said Poole; but it is impossible to stop an old woman
when she starts on her woes. The only hope is to divert her, as
Larry, sen., well knew.</p>

<p>"What I can't make out," he observed, "is how Larry came to ride
into a wallaby-pit. He must know that track like the palm of his
hand, unless, of course, he was drunk; even then his horse would
have saved him."</p>

<p>"My Larry doesn't drink," said his stepmother loyally.</p>

<p>"He's mighty different from other people's Larry if he doesn't,"
muttered his pa.</p>

<p>"Accidents are like that," said Poole. "Take my foot&mdash;how I
could have been such a new-chum I don't know. I wasn't drunk."</p>

<p>"Haw! Haw! Haw! There's no telling!" Any mention of alcohol was
so enlivening that Poole needed to say no more to change the
subject.</p>

<p>The Pooles reached the Timson pair by dark, and found them eager
for the family news.</p>

<p>"I would have gone to help Joanna only Norah Alfreda is at the
troublesome age and I have not been fit for much myself," said
Norah.</p>

<p>Chores out of the way, the elders were free to appreciate this
marvellous child, who could converse like a sage, according to the
doting Alf. Norah said the child was so sensitive that the least
excitement drove her off her food and sleep. She was a quaint
little thing, as lively as a cricket, and seated upon the knee of
the all-conquering Poole was soon fossicking for his watch. He
never failed with children, right from tinies to those in their
teens, reflected his sister. Such a pity he had none of his own,
till now it was too late. It was to be hoped he would never go soft
like old Jack Stanton and marry some young thing and have a
repetition of Stanton's troubles.</p>

<p>"They are so delighted with that nipper, it's a pity they can't
have half a dozen," remarked Poole, as they went on their way next
day.</p>

<p>"One will be plenty. Poor Norah suffers a great deal."</p>

<p>"What's the matter? She's not usually a croaker.</p>

<p>"No. Something internal, she fears. I don't like her colour. She
is like a corpse."</p>

<p>On reaching home they learnt that Milly was away at Gowandale
and Miss M'Eachern was wiring into the shearing. Poole said he
would bally well have to do likewise. However, owing to his
accident, arrangements had been made to do all the shearing at his
brother Jim's that season, and Bert's absence had not been so
insane an aberration as it might otherwise have been accounted by
family and neighbours. They simply thought he had grown tired of
confinement and went off unannounced to prevent opposition. The
M'Georges had "minded" their own business.</p>

<p>Milly's arrival at Gowandale was causing a good deal of
excitement, and one young man after another appeared eager to
borrow a wool-pack or a whetstone, or came on some such excuse.
Miss M'Eachern had had no such cloud of callers since dear knows
when, but what surprised that leal soul was Milly's depression.
Even after the reassuring telegram she did not brighten to her
wonted high-spirited self. Could she be in love with Larry
Healey?</p>

<p>Charlotte wandered about the old place like a being returned
from a planet. The house that she and Bert had been responsible for
making the new house, when ambition had been stirred by contact
with the Mazere clan upon Charlotte's marriage, was on its last
legs, and the new house, built a good ten years later, and which
Charlotte now saw for the first time, had a whiskered maturity. The
face of nature was changed by the clearing and fencing, and there
were two roofs within sight that made the station seem contracted.
She found a few of the original fruit-trees, gnarled and beyond
bearing, and the flower-beds before the old house retained the
design in which she and Bert had dug them in their teens. Poole's
Creek, as of old, came down by the back of the stables from
Eaglehawk singing its immortal lullaby, only it, too, looked bald
without the scrub. Willows and other aliens lifted their heads amid
its tea-tree and blackthorn, but its curves were the same. Also
unchanged were the contours of the ranges. They stretched away
endlessly to the north-west just as when she had ridden into them
on the morning after her marriage on a wedding trip to Mungee.
Great-grandma Mazere&mdash;not then a grandmother&mdash;had been
riding with her too, and not nearly so old then as Charlotte
herself was today. How time had run!</p>

<p>The homestead was so forlornly empty. No one there but Bert. She
gazed round the horizon towards Wombat Hill and Maryvale and Little
River and Gowandale; of the Timsons, Gilberts, Healeys, M'Eacherns,
and Pooles who had originally manned these holdings, not one now
remained. The old place, parched and pallid in the summer sunlight,
looked like an old dog that was sleeping before the door&mdash;too
old to be of any further use and merely awaiting the end.</p>

<p>Bert came out on the veranda and joined her. It was great to
have her there again at last. He wished they might ooze down into
old age in peace together; but that was impossible. Too many
vigorous younger lives of her own making claimed Charlotte, and
there was still her husband; astonishing how he hung on in spite of
drink.</p>

<p>"I'd like to go home as soon as possible," she said. "Forty-five
years&mdash;too long to stay away without coming back&mdash;better
not to come back at all than too late."</p>

<p>Bert saw that she was full of rare tears. He had been stupid not
to realize what it would mean to come back to an empty nest after
all the years. His heart smote him to fail his dear old Charlotte,
who had never failed him. He should have planned a great welcome
from all the younger tribe to fill the gap and keep sadness at bay.
He must make up for it now, shearing or no shearing. Charlotte was
more important than all the wool from Monaro to Muttama. He ordered
the horses and set out for Gowandale to cheer her, and also
dispatched M'George to Jim and Harry and Ada to announce the great
surprise. They could be depended upon to respond in a heartening
way.</p>

<p>Miss M'Eachern was surprised to see Charlotte and made her very
welcome.</p>

<p>"Milly acts as if she had something on her mind," she confided
to Poole. "Do you think she is infatuated with that young man and
wants to go to him?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, she can't endure him," said Poole, so decidedly that
Miss M'Eachern looked at him piercingly. She had seen amorous
propensities last long into senility with men otherwise well
balanced. "She's had a bit of a shock. She and Charlotte must be
livened up with company. I'll expect you over immediately shearing
is past."</p>

<p>Milly accompanied them home, and watching her closely Poole had
to admit the truth of Miss M'Eachern's observation.</p>

<p>The family rallied to Charlotte, and Bert was content to see her
first melancholy merge into quiet enjoyment of the Christmas
festivities enlarged and specialized in her honour. Mrs Saunders
permitted Milly to remain on Monaro without censure, and spoke of
paving a visit at New Year to fetch her home.</p>

<p>Though Charlotte grew to enjoy her holiday, Milly's abstraction
and uneasiness increased so that Charlotte, like Jessie, remarked,
"Do you think she cares very much about Larry Healey, and is
fretting about him, and would like to go to him?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, not at all. She'd as soon think of a gorilla in that
respect."</p>

<p>"You never can tell what fancy a girl will have in the case of a
man. She usually sees something in him that no one looking on can
understand, and Larry is good-looking and taking."</p>

<p>"That's true sometimes, but there's nothing in Larry for Milly
to see," he contended with finality, thinking there was no fool
like an old fool, yet feeling in no wise old or foolish. "Milly
will find her feet for herself presently if she is let alone."</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Larry was painfully recovering at Wamgambril Springs, attended
by his stepmother and sister. Mrs Healey was enlivened by the
change and the importance she assumed. Larry, suffering pain and
discomfort and with his mind in worse case than his body, was not
an endearing patient. Seeing the door of delight closing upon him
through the retribution of his act with Dot, he had sought to keep
it open by violence, and thereby smashed the whole edifice. He was
in a rash of curiosity to know what end and what face Milly had put
on the escapade. That she must be alive and well somewhere was
certain. The injury or illness of Milly Saunders would not be
overlooked in that region. Strange that no one could mention Milly,
though the infernal old windbags kept on and on for hours about
everything else till he wished he could throw them a bait and
relieve his aching head. They were as had as the flies that buzzed
during daylight.</p>

<p>He knew that Poole had been down and had taken his sister back
with him, which was attributed to the leisure of his convalescence.
Larry heard with genuine regret that Norah was not well. With
unfailing kindness she had written to say that this was the reason
she had not hurried to his assistance, and she invited him to come
and rest with her and Alf as soon as he could travel. Of Dot he was
likewise continually informed. Her movements appeared of interest
to his womenfolk, probably because of Ronald Dice.</p>

<p>"Julie says that Ronald Dice is for everlasting at Saunders
Plains now, but that Dot won't have anything to do with him."</p>

<p>"I'm sure!" ejaculated Joanna unbelievingly. "She was running
after him for all to see while he was wanting Aileen; it is not
likely she has changed so soon."</p>

<p>"They say she has changed so you wouldn't know her since that
time in Sydney&mdash;goes nowhere, only looks after the old people,
and she used to be such a one for flying round."</p>

<p>"Must have been someone in Sydney and it didn't come off. That's
what is the matter."</p>

<p>"She'll be glad to take Ronald presently."</p>

<p>"The old people don't want her to leave them."</p>

<p>"Then he can live there. He doesn't seem to be much of a doer.
Aileen must be thankful now when she sees the difference in the two
men. I used to be anxious when I heard of Ronald being so much at
Ten Creeks. You never noticed anything, did you, Joanna?"</p>

<p>"It was Milly he was spoony on there. Ronald is one of those
light-weights with a rag on every bush, but Larry cut him out
there, didn't you, Larry?"</p>

<p>Larry took his opportunity. "Where the deuce is Milly these
days? She might have cantered over to ask how I am. And I wish to
goodness you'd stop talking a bit."</p>

<p>He lay and puzzled about Milly. Surely the return of the Young
Whisker filly would raise a buzz in the district.</p>

<p>Things were moving. That very evening little Tommy Roper, the
unexcelled gatherer and disseminator of news from Riverina to
Monaro, blew in to Dan's. He was working up the River to Monaro and
had come by way of Cuppinbingle and Keba. At the former stronghold
he had forgathered with Paddy Leary in mellow condition, and his
share of the epic of rescuing Romp had been expounded with no
minimizing of Milly's part.</p>

<p>Milly, while her mother and uncle were off the track, had bolted
all the way to Goulburn, seized her own mare with no by-your-leave
to judge or jury, nor permission of police nor benefit of clergy,
and just travelled round the country with a young man and played
Old Harry as she damned well thought fit! There was the hell of a
fine snorting blood filly for you, if there never was another, and
she barely eighteen! Milly had Paddy Leary's franchise
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"We'll hear of her marrying Larry next thing," commented
Tommy.</p>

<p>"That's what Larry was &mdash;&mdash; well working for all
right, and didn't she just have him on the go!" guffawed Paddy.
"But there's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip, and if Larry
got outside of himself a bit, I wouldn't be surprised if Milly gave
him one over the ear and let him go tell his ma about it. She ain't
got any of that sort of thing in her, it's plain to be seen by a
wall-eyed bandicoot."</p>

<p>"She'll have to marry him after this or her goose would be
cooked with anyone else," said Tommy, who had none of the Celt in
him and appraised the escapade from a different mind.</p>

<p>"Miss Milly don't let anyone cook her goose as easy as they want
to. She ain't one of the cowering crying females that flings up the
sponge. I'll take a bet on that!"</p>

<p>Tommy Roper, progressing to the kitchen of Ten Creeks Run for
his next night, was surprised to hear no word of the reappearance
of the filly, with which he expected the firmament to be humming.
There was compensation in the boss item that Larry Healey on
Abracadabra, a mountain-bred horse, had fallen into old Billy
Heffernan's wallaby-traps at Wamgambril&mdash;a terrible crash, and
was now at Dan Spires s.</p>

<p>"They say he'll never walk again, and his face is cut up like a
Maori," Long Billy informed him. Tommy rubbed his hands with
enjoyment. Stay in a place and nothing ever happened, but go away
for the shortest spell and there were enough goings-on to fill a
book.</p>

<p>"How the dooce did that happen?"</p>

<p>"Reckon he musta been soused, don't you? I reckon that he's
taken to drink lately, an' young Milly's got hold of it an' that's
why she cleared out suddent like."</p>

<p>"Has she cleared out?" Tommy's eyes fairly leapt.</p>

<p>"When the Missus and ole Lucy took the youngster to Sydney,
Nally wuz here with ole Skinny Guts, an' all of a suddent he said
he had business in Bool Bool, an' he sent Jane home so as we
couldn't be doin' nothin' wrong with the pore innercent little
girl," Billy put his thumb to his nose, "an' young Milly was to go
down to Keba for a week. She went over the river for a night fust,
takin' nothink but a little valise. That wuz all right, and then
ole Skinny come back, an' we hear Larry is all busted up, an'
nothink at all about young Milly comin' back at all; an' then
nearly a week later ole Skinny comes to me with a parcel the size
of a sugar-bag an' tells me to ketch the mailman at Keba with it,
an' I see it was addressed to Milly at Curradoobidgee&mdash;must er
been her duds, I reckon. Now I gotter ride over termorrer an' bring
Jane home, so it looks as if the Missus an' youngster must be
makin' tracks for this shanty. But don't you reckon Larry's been on
the booze? There's been some kind of a bust-up among 'em, that's
plain."</p>

<p>Nothing of the filly. Tommy was too skilled a news-gatherer to
put his foot in the fabric. "What do you reckon Larry was doin'
poochin' about ole Billy's rat-traps&mdash;that ain't on the direk
bridle-track from Keba to Ten Creeks?"</p>

<p>"That's why I reckon he was tanked up, an' young Milly belted
off to Poole. She allers runs to him like as if he wuz her ma. I
smell a rat somewhere, don't you?"</p>

<p>"You mean Larry was on the big brown outer that ole chestnut ole
Larry used ter ride?" Long Billy nodded. "Well, it stan's to
reason, if he wuz drunk, a mountain-bred horse like that would have
took him home safe an' not been runnin' inter no wallaby-pit. An
ole cab-horse rared on Sydney gas-jets would know enough fer
that."</p>

<p>Tommy, agog to pursue this lively spoor, made Wamgambril Springs
his next place of call, ostensibly to inquire after the new baby
and Larry. The baby was pronounced a blue-ribboner and then he
turned to inspect Larry.</p>

<p>"It's a life-saver to see you," said Larry. "How's the season
down the river?"</p>

<p>"The seasons seem to have gone mad, but all the same it's not
what you'd call too stinkin'. What the dooce have you been and gone
and done to yourself? Been havin' no end of a birthday by the look
er things."</p>

<p>"By golly, I don't know what happened till it did, and I wasn't
drunk I might tell you&mdash;hadn't a taste of anything stronger
than tea for a fortnight, but I might as well tell that to the grey
magpies: so they can think what they flaming well like."</p>

<p>Deftest prospecting got nothing further from Larry, and left
Tommy with whetted curiosity. He decided to inspect the pit and
refused an invitation to stay the night. "Some other time, thanks,
but a feller I know is in a hurry for skins so I'll drop in on ole
Heffernan while I'm so near."</p>

<p>Though his opportunities were not so rich and his disposition
more suspicious, Heffernan was Tommy's peer as a bush telegraph.
Roper rode to the hut prepared to do some news-trading. He took it
upon himself to stay the night, volunteering to make flap-jacks.
Afterwards, when pipes were going, he opened up. "I heerd furder
down the river that Larry found that roan Young Whisker filly that
was supposed to be dead that time we wuz all on the string hunting
for her. You haven't seen her anywhere, have you?"</p>

<p>"Never heard anything about it," said Heffernan cautiously, but
an inner light was exciting him.</p>

<p>"I had it from a man who seen him goin' by with the horse. He
said he had someone with him, too. Do you reckon he an' someone had
a fight over the filly, an' that's how he got smashed?"</p>

<p>"I don't reckon the fight was about a horse," said Heffernan, as
if he knew much more.</p>

<p>"A female, eh?" Tommy winked dexterously.</p>

<p>"What female?"</p>

<p>"What female is most interested in young Larry?"</p>

<p>"Old Mother Humphreys?" Heffernan cackled at his own wit. The
inner circles of ribaldry had a staple joke about Heffernan's
rebuff by this practitioner.</p>

<p>"What female is most interested in the Young Whisker filly?"
Heffernan estimated that Tommy knew more than he did himself. He
produced the hat-pin and tattered veil.</p>

<p>"Ever seen either of them things before?"</p>

<p>"I remember a hat-pin same as that."</p>

<p>"What do you reckon them gewgaws was doin' beside my wallaby-pit
the mornin' I got Larry out?"</p>

<p>Roper whistled long and suggestively. Then he doffed guards and
they put the pieces together with gusto. What Milly and Larry were
doing at the salt-shed not directly on the track to anywhere some
time between the Friday night, on which Paddy Leary said they left
Goulburn, and the Monday morning when Billy went his rounds, was a
matter for speculation. Familiarity with certain male propensities
until that date unrealized by Milly aided them in their
conclusions.</p>

<p>"What do you reckon we'll find out next?" said Roper.</p>

<p>"That Milly will &mdash;&mdash; well go to Sydney for a long
stay like Dot." Heffernan winked as dexterously as Roper.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Lucy, Aileen, and Lawrence John did not arrive at Stanton's
Plains till time for the Christmas family gathering there. Lawrence
was an object of interest. Maggots crawling into the ears had
caused grave trouble, but the specialist was hopeful of recovery in
time. His mother also was very well. She slept soundly, free from
nightmares of snakes, and had a good appetite. She did not,
however, recover her backbone, not that she had possessed a stiff
one. She seemed to be lost without Lucy, who directed her far more
firmly than she had dared to deal with Milly, since that young lady
could hold her own spoon and bat in the eye those that crossed her
will.</p>

<p>When the excitement of arrival subsided, SP-over-J had to inform
Lucy how Milly had distinguished herself. Following Tommy Roper's
peregrination, the country fairly palpitated from Yass and
Queanbeyan to Goulburn and Turrill Turrill and back again to Bool
Bool and Monaro. The family, the last to be informed of the
scandalous element of the adventure, had at length to take notice.
Some of the gossip reaching Stanton's ears was as infuriating as
what he had overheard concerning himself the day that Towser was
poisoned. He and Lucy had high words as the report proceeded.</p>

<p>"You ought to have kept Milly under a little more and this sort
of thing wouldn't have happened."</p>

<p>"You might have taken care of her while I was away with the baby
and his mother, who didn't look after him, or that mess wouldn't
have been."</p>

<p>They tossed it back and forth till they came to the trite
conclusion that nothing could be done by crying over spilt milk,
and that the present problem must be handled.</p>

<p>"The whole country says that Larry will have to marry her," said
SP-over-J.</p>

<p>"He was always pestering me to do that, but I don't like it. His
prospects are not very bright, and if he's going to be a cripple it
will be no joke." She dared not say that she hated the thought of
any more Healeys. "Have you said anything to Larry about it, and
asked him what he meant by acting that way with a young girl as
soon as your back was turned; and do you know that she has really
come to&mdash;to&mdash;you know, any real harm, or is it only
scandalmongering?"</p>

<p>"I thought it better to lie low till you came home. Charlotte
being at Curradoobidgee, it is the best place for Milly to be out
of mischief for the present."</p>

<p>"Wonderful how Milly has always acted as if Bert was her
father." Milly having rushed straight off to Poole was a saving
element to her mother. SP-over-J grunted. He thought it was Lucy
who wanted Poole as Milly's stepfather; as for Milly and Poole, he
was blamed if he knew what they thought, but anything that hatched
there would not upset SP-over-J.</p>

<p>"I'll have to go straight up to Monaro and talk seriously to
Milly," said Lucy. Her brother gave a wizened grin, and said in
that case Aileen had better stay at Stanton's Plains or go to
Neangen to see her mother until Lucy returned. It was thus tacitly
settled that in future Aileen was not fit to be mistress of her own
household. This restored Lucy to a definite status with her
brother.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p>Milly's abstraction continued. In spite of her pluck and her
repudiation of Larry she felt herself shamed and disgraced. Worse,
in her young ignorance she was haunted by possible serious
consequences. Sex knowledge had to come to girls in underhand
whispers in her day, and in her excited state she had exaggerated
possibilities out of all proportion till she was obsessed and
robbed of sleep and peace.</p>

<p>Poole, watching closely, saw that she was losing weight, while
her eyes had a sunken look that added years to her age. He felt it
was time to intervene. Opportunity occurred one day when Milly with
an attitude foreign to her had pleaded headache, and stayed mooning
about the house while Gharlotte went over to Jinn's.</p>

<p>"Say, Milly, old pal, what is it?" he said, placing a kindly
hand on her shoulder as they loitered in the drawing-room after
dinner. "You haven't forgotten promising me that if ever you needed
my help you'd ask for it." He swung her round to look deeply in her
face. What he saw caused him to sit down and lift her on to his
knee, as he had not done, for his own sake, for several years
now.</p>

<p>"Is it Larry?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you care very much about him?" He tautly awaited her
reply.</p>

<p>Milly started aghast. "I hate the sight of him. I loathe him! At
first I was horrified that I had killed him, and now sometimes I'm
sorry that he's alive, because it was his own fault. I didn't know
the pit was there."</p>

<p>"It was entirely his own fault, all that happened to him as far
as that is concerned, but for your sake it is much better that he
is alive. If you don't like him, what is the worry?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Bert, can you help me; what am I to do? I'll die if
you can't help me."</p>

<p>"That sounds terribly serious. Tell me all about it." Poole's
quiet years had been rich in that experience which can become a key
to the heart of groping, heady youth. He would never be guilty of
phrases or quips such as had fallen from Potter and Dice to freeze
confession or wither appeal for enlightenment. Under his calming
kindness the girl's tortured distress tumbled forth. Nothing was
withheld, not even what Milly would have died rather than discuss
with her mother, who, though fine for lots of issues, had not her
daughter's confidence in this field.</p>

<p>A delicate half-question here and there and Poole was able to
restore his charge to harmonious sanity. She remained in his arms,
her face against his heart, his chin resting on her wealth of
bright locks. Her arms stole round his neck&mdash;tentatively. No
response. The lowering of his head was the only yielding to
temptation. Milly put her cheek against his.</p>

<p>"I'm never going to leave you again&mdash;<i>never</i>! If I had
really been disgraced I was going to ask you to marry me to save
me. You promised long, long ago when I was young to help me no
matter how big a mess I was in, either that or I should have had to
kill myself." Thus to inexperience loom desperate expedients.</p>

<p>Poole improved his embrace, the blood drumming in his ears with
an excitation long forgotten but sweeter than ever, though this was
madness&mdash;sheer madness. Presently he would wake from a dream
into sanity, and the brakes of common sense and decency would have
to be applied with a crash.</p>

<p>"In any case it could never, never have come to that while your
old Bert was alive to save you."</p>

<p>"You would have saved me, even if...if..."</p>

<p>"Of course! You bet your life, mad with joy to have had the
chance. It was all in the bargain we made, our old compact." Ah, he
thought, what a privilege to help such fragrant youth to mend its
broken shield!</p>

<p>"Oh, you darling, <i>darling</i>!" The strong young arms
tightened round his neck. "Then do you remember that you are
engaged to me, have been ever since the time of the bridge
opening?"</p>

<p>"Do you remember too?"</p>

<p>"As if I could forget a <i>compact</i>! You said it was to be a
secret engagement. It is time to make it public now."</p>

<p>This was surely delirium tremens; something from his injured
foot had temporarily affected his brain, but ah, it was sweet while
it lasted! "Milly, we have gone to sleep and are dreaming a lovely
dream."</p>

<p>"Yes, and when we wake up we'll find it true."</p>

<p>"All right! Hush-a-bye baby, on the tree top," he said
playfully, placing her more comfortably and falling silent in his
grandly quiet way. No appropriate words came to him. Milly nestled
blissfully on her rock of sympathetic understanding. Uncle Bert was
always perfect. He never failed her and she was taking the only way
of securing him for her very own, having grown to sufficient
understanding to marvel that she had not lost her chance long
since. Relief flooded her harried soul. Her eyelids drooped. Bert
looked down and caught a drowsy smile.</p>

<p>The old clock on the mantel ticked loudly. Queen Victoria in her
girlish comeliness looked down upon them from above it, her consort
by her side. A hen, feeling the moment auspicious, introduced her
chicks to the flower-beds in the sunlight to be seen through the
open doorway. She scratched like a hurricane undisturbed. Cocky,
dozing on a rail near the geranium-pots, screeched at the
vandalism, and, waddling across the boards, hopped down the steps
to investigate. No one came at his call, so he relinquished police
duty and joined in the looting. Farther afield could be heard the
cackling of hens, bad housekeepers these, late at their duties.
Occasionally the moo of a cow, the neigh of a horse, or the yap of
a dog carried to the comfortable old room, arranged in bygone
fashion, and a monument to the good taste of old Stepmother Poole.
Such sounds embellished rather than disturbed the silence, and grew
softer as the sparkling heat climbed towards 3 p.m.</p>

<p>Milly was sleeping easily, repose in every line.</p>

<p>Out through the open doorway was a wide rolling Monaro view, the
road to Gowandale like an ivory ribbon running over a knoll,
disappearing and reappearing and losing itself in the blue horizon
of the ranges far away. As the silence widened in the peak of the
afternoon the lullaby of Poole's Creek drifted in like a far sweet
wind faintly borne from paradise, and to Poole, this moment
irrespective of all that had been in his more than sixty years, in
spite of all that could be in the twenty or so more coming to him,
was paradise unqualified.</p>

<p>A man might well barter his soul for such a moment.</p>

<p>Cocky thought the silence called for examination. He climbed the
steps with the aid of his beak, making guttural murmurs as he
progressed across the veranda, and entered the drawing-room, a
splendid gentleman in his snowy plumage. Seeing his master's
occupation he raised his crest with magisterial air, his black beak
very smart and his black tongue moving in it like an indiarubber
ball.</p>

<p>"What's this?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"You might well ask, old man," whispered Poole, with a soft
laugh of joy.</p>

<p>Cocky did not relish being ignored. He walked all round the
peculiar pair, his claws making their own sound on the hardwood
boards, uncovered but for a splendid skin here and there. Then he
climbed Poole's knee. He was lifted away and set down at a
distance. This annoyed him. He accepted attentions from Milly but
would not be suppressed on her behalf. He established himself on
Poole's shoulder and demanded, "Hullo! What's this?" Receiving no
answer, he began to scold the dog.</p>

<p>"You're no gentleman, Cocky," said Poole. "But perhaps you are
bringing me to common sense."</p>

<p>Having wakened the sleeper he was ready to be agreeable. "Cocky
doesn't know what to make of us," said Poole.</p>

<p>"Ask him to be best man at our wedding. He looks like an old
J.P.&mdash;pity he couldn't marry us now without fuss."</p>

<p>So! When awake and relieved of her fears she still meant it.
Nevertheless it was madness, and if translated from the dream to
actuality he would be culpable of something as reprehensible as the
pressure SP-over-J had put upon Aileen Healey.</p>

<p>"I hear Mrs M'George coming with tea."</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Milly. But Poole, on guard for her, stood
her on the floor and all was normal when the guid soul appeared.
"We'll have to tell everybody," Milly continued, when pouring
tea.</p>

<p>"Do you think we'd better?"</p>

<p>"You don't mean you want to break our <i>compact</i>!"</p>

<p>"The whole tribe would want to give me a bait for such a thing,
and I should deserve it. Surely you were old enough to remember
something of what they thought of your Uncle Jack; and he was a
year or two younger than I am now, and Aileen was a good many years
older than you are, my lady."</p>

<p>"That was because he took her away from Ronald, and I was born
older than poor Aunt Aileen will ever have the savvy to be."</p>

<p>"That's probably true. But still and all you're not as old as
you'll be ten or twenty years hence, and if I took advantage of the
whim of a young girl and you woke up to find yourself with a
toothless old josser on your hands..."</p>

<p>"It's not you that's taking advantage of me. I'm taking
advantage of you."</p>

<p>"I believe that's true, too. You are making a rattling fool of
me. Aunt Charlotte will have to bring us back to reason. Don't you
think it had better be the same old secret engagement just for you
and me, till one day you'll come and tell me that you have picked a
nice young chap? I promise never to sue you for breach of
promise."</p>

<p>"Oh no! You are not going to leave me to get into more troubles
with no-chop young men. You don't&mdash;what I mean is, don't you
<i>want</i> me?" she demanded, looking deeply and earnestly into
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Milly, that would be like refusing paradise. It is of you I am
thinking."</p>

<p>"Well, then, we must tell Aunt Charlotte and make it secure as
soon as possible, or someone else will be snapping you up."</p>

<p>Charlotte, in the judicious Poole way, said only that she was so
astonished that she must have time to think. She spent a night of
misgiving. She had long wished her brother to have a wife and
children of his own, but this was a fantastic notion of this
high-spirited girl, this child, young enough to be his
granddaughter. It was unseemly. Oh, that he had chosen someone
suitable to his years! But who was there? Jessie M'Eachern, but she
was as rough as a man to look at, and old and set in her ways, and
if they had not made a go of it long ago, it was sensible of them
to know it was beyond them now. Everyone said Lucy Saunders was
willing, a capable nice-looking woman and managing&mdash;too
managing. Charlotte could not picture Bert comfortable, driven from
his quiet easiness by her. There was Mrs Labosseer, his old flame
at Coolooluk, near his own age, but fat and a
grandmother&mdash;that was impossible. There were the Dice sisters,
the Farquharsons, and other young women ready to capture
Curradoobidgee Poole, but though they were more than ten years
older than Milly they did not seem to fit, either.</p>

<p>Second thoughts of Milly were not so startling. There had always
been a strong affinity between these two. It was possible that they
could combine the relationship of daughter and wife, husband and
father, and that it might work until that shoal ahead, such a
little way ahead too, when Poole must become decrepit while Milly
rose to her prime. But that shoal might never he reached. It would
cause talk, but only a nine-days wonder, and Charlotte had known
many in her time. It couldn't be any worse than the indecent talk
forty-five years ago when Miss Mayborn, the English governess, to
the astonishment of the whole district, had married her father,
trimmed his beard and disciplined him, and remade life for the
family.</p>

<p>"What is to be, will be," she murmured, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Poole's own misgivings were more disquieting. In ten years he
would have the real old man upon him, and Milly, twenty-eight,
would be at the crest of youthful maturity. Would she loathe him
then?</p>

<p>He lay awake all night wrestling with temptation, and with the
dawn and the cool winds sweeping down from Eaglehawk, the spectre
disappeared and he turned a face of deep happiness to the rising
sun. He would take this gift. It should be Milly's to use him in
accordance with her desire and her need. He would take this evening
smile of nature for ten, five, or only three years. There was no
doubt the child was happy with him now, and theirs was a long,
steadily maturing friendship and understanding. When his senility
should endanger their edifice built without hands&mdash;well, a man
had only to die once; there were lots of simple accidents to a man
of resource; and youthful widowhood was no bad thing.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Lucy Saunders and Stanton were informed before it was let go any
further. Lucy was deeply chagrined and shocked. She said it was not
to be thought of, and ordered Milly home. Stanton went up to Monaro
to bring her away himself. He was cynical and sneering, but not
dangerous, as he revelled in Poole's fall.</p>

<p>"I've come to rescue Milly. I've got all the advice you gave me
without being asked, saved up for you, and you're older in the horn
than I was five years ago, and Milly is younger than Aileen
was."</p>

<p>"You can spare your breath," said Poole good-temperedly. "I've
remembered it all, Jack, and you can't tell me anything I haven't
thought."</p>

<p>"And are you going on?"</p>

<p>"If Milly doesn't change her mind, I am. There is one
difference, if I might say it without offence&mdash;Milly is
willing." He could have said that Milly had proposed, both now and
earlier, but that secret he kept for himself.</p>

<p>"She is now, but perhaps later the regrets will be on her side.
There's no fool like an old fool. <i>Don't you think, Bert, that
you and I have left it so long that we had better leave marriage
altogether now? Milly's a taking little girl, but rather a
child</i>. Do you remember reeling that off to me?" Stanton laughed
heartily.</p>

<p>"Yes, Jack. I know it all, but Milly is an exceptional
child."</p>

<p>"Christ, that's good!" said SP-over-J, and rocked with rare
enjoyment. "<i>It's none of my business, of course, only I hope you
tvill be able to keep your noddle later if things don't turn out
exactly paradise. It is sometimes better to squabash things in the
egg stage</i>." Stanton would have been disappointed to find Poole
could be deterred.</p>

<p>Milly, who had no misgivings, no reservations in her happiness,
tackled her uncle, swinging upon his arm. "Uncle Jack, it's lovely
and friendly of you to come as soon as you heard the news. I was
bridesmaid for you, and you must give me away in return. And, Uncle
Jack, don't you think you had better take me to Turrill Turrill and
have me married from there? It will save a lot of talk." Stanton
liked Milly swinging on his arm. She warmed his constricted heart
as so very few could. He remembered how she had stuck to him
through his wedding, and all through his married life. He might
lecture her mother about her behind her back, but his knees gave in
her presence.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you find someone nearer the nephew age for me? It will
look rather silly to have Bert calling me uncle, won't it?" He
chuckled anew.</p>

<p>"I wish he was a bit younger," admitted Milly. "But that can't
be helped. I'd rather have him a hundred and eighty than anyone
else at any age."</p>

<p>"You'll have to face your mother."</p>

<p>"Let her stay at Ten Creeks and look after Aunt Aileen and you
can do everything for me at Turrill Turrill."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you bolt and get it over that way?"</p>

<p>"As if I was ashamed! I want a real wedding with you helping
me."</p>

<p>"I suppose I'll have to fork up a present. Do you want a very
swell trousseau?"</p>

<p>"Uncle jack, you know you are a scrumptious darling!"</p>

<p>No other called Jack Stanton such names. They went to his head
or his heart. "You know, Milly, I'd like to see you happy," he said
in accents of unwonted affection, "but in the course of nature Bert
will have to leave you."</p>

<p>"I can't bear to think of that. Perhaps Aunt Aileen and I could
keep each other company." There were tears on Milly's lashes. She
was not engaging in repartee. Stanton forbore to continue the
discussion in that direction.</p>

<p>"Well, if you can bring your mother round, I can't stop you from
doing what you want."</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>Poole pilgrimaged to his old friend Great-grandma Mazere. He
wanted to tell her himself of Milly's affection for him. She took
it wonderfully well, but, then, Poole did not seem so old to
her.</p>

<p>"You have left it very late, my boy, and the girl is over-young
for you. Do you think it is wise?"</p>

<p>"No, Mrs Mazere, I do not. I have had terrible misgivings. I am
ready to release Milly."</p>

<p>"She was always very fond of you. She is not an unwilling bride.
Her head is older than those on most young shoulders. The danger is
that you may leave her with a young family, that is hard on a
woman."</p>

<p>"That happens to those who have young husbands too
sometimes."</p>

<p>"Quite true, and sometimes it would be easier to be left a widow
than suffer what some wives do."</p>

<p>"I shall be able to provide for her comfortably."</p>

<p>"Well, my boy, if it is the Lord's will, He can settle all
things. I hope you will be happy and that the Lord will bless you.
You must be patient with youth."</p>

<p>"I shall, so help me God, if youth will be patient with me."</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>The news was a blow to Larry. There had been moments of wild
hope that the scandal would drive Milly to him, though underneath
he knew her better than that. He had lost at the salt-shed for ever
and must cover up defeat as best he could. He was not coming out of
this as spiritually unscathed as he had from his other
misdemeanour. When convalescent he gratefully accepted an
invitation to go to Billy-go-Billy. Once there his shrinking from
Norah Alfreda vanished. She was an engaging and sensitive
chatterbox who delighted in her new subject and aroused a dormant
love of children, which made him blossom in secret wonder and
pride, in his share in the child's parentage.</p>

<p>His thoughts turned to Dot. Had she no interest in her child?
Was she frightened of it as he had been; would personal contact
alter that?&mdash;though in the nature of things she must have seen
the infant. Was she an unnatural mother? How could she be otherwise
in the circumstances&mdash;and they of his making? Larry was soft
at the core, and the generous unselfish kindness of Norah and Alf
showed him his own delinquencies. His sympathies awakened towards
Dot. Formerly he had wished to hear of her disposed of as the wife
of anyone: in view of his discovery of Norah Alfreda, he was
relieved that Dot was still free. He wondered why. Did she care
more for him than for Dice? He was pricked by that inner weakness,
a conscience. The desire to make amends overtook him.</p>

<p>Dot, on the contrary, was increasingly embittered by what she
had been through and continued to endure. She had no debilitating
sense of her own shortcomings, and regarded Larry and a mad impulse
as entirely responsible for her ignominious situation. She did not
soften to Ronald, and was weary of her life. The hard possessive
attitude and unrelaxing exactions of her mother were insupportable.
Because of her daughter's fall, and her intervention with her
husband, the old lady considered Dot her special property, and Dot
lay awake many a night longing for a housemaid's job at the Wynyard
Hotel in Sydney as an escape. Marriage was her only practicable
opening and she had a vengeful notion to free herself from Saunders
Plains by marrying Larry, but hardly expected him to approach her
again.</p>

<p>The announcement of Milly's engagement naturally caused a
freshet of gossip, following as it did upon the escapade with Larry
Healey. In the talk that blew back and forth across the ranges Dot
could not escape the assertions that Larry had been infatuated with
Milly. Well! Ronald had been even wilder in pursuit of Aileen, yet
here he was now moaning after herself. Men! thought Dot
contemptuously.</p>

<p>The Poole nephews and nieces had always expected something like
this to happen, but nevertheless had not believed Uncle Bert would
be quite so silly as to allow himself to be fastened upon by an
infant out of the cradle. They did not say much of this in Uncle
Bert's hearing. He did not invite impertinence, he was so
good-natured that it fell away from him, his record inspired
respect and he was dearly loved. He looked so contented and well
that his contemporaries thought the risk he was taking worth while,
even if bliss could not last: and how many love affairs did last,
when you took your coat off to them? said the worldly wise.</p>

<p>Great-grandma Mazere and Aunt Charlotte uttered no word of
criticism, and among the youngsters Milly had always pursued an
original path more among adults than those of her own years. Lucy
Saunders tried to postpone the wedding till Milly was twenty-one.
"Three more years on to Bert's age would probably cure her," she
said, but Milly was no Aileen to be thwarted. Also Lucy's circle
were more humorous than sympathetic to her, for they considered she
was jealous herself not to be the bride. She felt that to let Milly
have her way might be the lesser trouble. She would at least be
provided for, and Lucy now had a m&eacute;tier with her brother,
and so gave in. She urged a little delay for the promised year in
society. Poole also recommended this, but Milly would not be
deflected. So it was decided that the marriage should take place
from Turrill Turrill in March and the family return there early for
this.</p>

<p>Heffernan stuck the silver hat-pin in the rafter of his hut as a
mascot. It had no commercial value. Paddy Leary was justified in
his opinion and let it be known to Tommy Roper. "Sure, didn't I
tell you that Miss Milly wouldn't let anyone cook her goose for
her? Pulled right back an' broke the bridle, if I know anything!
She wouldn't sit down under what a few old magpies said about her.
Wonder what she saw in such an old feller though, an upstanding
blood filly like that. Wasn't rared onder a bin, eh, Mick?"</p>

<p>"Sure, she knew a rale man whin she saw him, and didn't moind a
bit of age. She knew at anny age he'd be betther than these
flea-headed gomerils they're rarin' today&mdash;rared onder a hin,
huh, they've been rared onder a bed-bug!"</p>

<p>Rebecca and Norah in the private parlour of the hotel had many a
confabulation.</p>

<p>"Sure, wondhers will never cease! Oi'll not be surprised if I
hear anny day of ould Great-granny Mazere herself walkin' off with
a young feller half her age."</p>

<p>"There's plenty would do it for the property, if they could be
sure it all went to her."</p>

<p>"It's Lucy Saunders is the disappointed woman."</p>

<p>"More suitable it would have been. Still an' all, Milly was
always an odd child, and much more suited to being an old man's
darling than a young man's slave. She's settled, at any rate. Poole
has a good sound property and he will give it all to her&mdash;and
the sort of man to have money in the bank as well, that is when the
banks mend."</p>

<p>"Sure, he's betther than Ronald or Larry. There's something
powerful quare and peculiar about what happened Larry. Milly could
tell more of that than Larry'd loike annywan to know, by what Tommy
Roper was hintin' in the bar."</p>

<p>"If all's true Stanton would have been within his rights to turn
Aileen out, and then Ronald dropped her and took to Dot. Strange
she won't have him now."</p>

<p>"They tell me whin Larry was goin' through from Dan Spires's he
met Dot right in the road, and she pulled up and asked him how he
was. The Stantons' servant told my Julia, and Dot said, 'You
betther come an' see me whin you're well.' What do you make of
it?"</p>

<p>"They'll get sorted out in the end. Tommy said the last Sunday
he was at Keba, Ronald was there hanging round Rose
Farquharson."</p>

<p>"Sure, a rose on ivery bush for Ronald."</p>

<p>"Milly is not going to show herself here till after the wedding.
Little Ignez Milford is going to be the only bridesmaid. They're
going to Monaro after the honeymoon and not show up here till the
commotion has died down."</p>

<p>"There's wan thing you've never told me, phwat did Dot do with
the choild?"</p>

<p>"It will come out in the wash presently. It's always facts that
I tell you, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"'Tis there, it is. Av coorse, I'd believe ye if ye said ould Mr
Eustace Blenkinsop&mdash;the ould scut&mdash;was going to marry Mrs
Labosseer at Coolooluk, and that Teddy O'Mara was chose for the
next mimber of Parliament for Bool Bool...But sure, Poole's more of
an mild fool than I would have thought him. Left it till he's gone
silly, an' picked a choild."</p>

<p>"Jacob says he's a lucky devil."</p>

<p>"Och, wouldn't ivery dhrivellin' ould great-gran'pa run off wid
a little gurrul in short frocks if he could! Sure, they seem to
lack aise entoirely in that rayspict, an' whin they settle down
'tis because some ould woman who can see through thim has a
broomstick in pickle to intercept their capers."</p>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p>Philip Mazere, third of the name, commonly known as Young
Philip, went to the post-office with a bundle of telegrams.</p>

<p>GREAT-GRANDMA PASSED AWAY PEACEFULLY IN SLEEP 2 AM FUNERAL
SUNDAY WOULD LIKE YOU TO COME MAZERE</p>

<p>One of these went to Poole of Curradoobidgee, Monaro; another to
Miss Jessie M'Eachern hard by; a third to Raymond Poole, Macquarie
Chambers, Sydney; a fourth to John Stanton, Turrill Turrill,
Riverina; others to names well known from Gundagai to Goulburn. A
long message was addressed to Prendergast, a still longer one to
Joseph Mazere to his last known address.</p>

<p>"By Jove, we'll all miss her!" observed the
post-and-telegraphmaster. "Bool Bool won't seem the same any more.
She's always been there for everyone in the place. There isn't
anyone left to remember Bool Bool before she came."</p>

<p>"There wasn't any Bool Bool before she came. She's the last of
them all. There are only the M'Haffetys and Isaacs and Browning
anywhere near her age that have been here from nearly the
beginning."</p>

<p>"She'll have a great funeral."</p>

<p>"We're afraid of overlooking someone. If you think of anyone
left out of that list, I'd be obliged if you would let me
know."</p>

<p>"I sce you have old Bill Prendergast."</p>

<p>"Yes. She reared his wife, and it was a promise that he'd take
her for her last drive."</p>

<p>"I'll never forget her going to the bridge that day as spry as a
girl under her parasol, and those four greys stepping so they
wouldn't break an egg-shell...I'll get these away at once."</p>

<p>Philip Mazere murmured a word of thanks and went up Stanton
Street, which ran out of the township into a red road that topped a
cleared foothill or two and disappeared into the blue ranges, still
untouched of man towards Mungee and Coolooluk. He was a tal! dark
man in the forties, favouring his mother's people in appearance. He
halted as he turned into Mazere's Lane and meditated on the
panoramic view. It had changed little within his memory, and it was
his birthplace. Most of the town had appeared in the gold-rush
period of the late fifties and early sixties and since had dozed in
arrested development. The valley in the ranges amid plentiful
watercourses had been left very beautiful by the Creator and the
aborigines, and though the settlers had done their best to tame it
without substituting any worthy works of man, their efforts had so
far been too puny to obliterate natural loveliness. The cottages
devoid of architectural grace, set down where the timber had been
indiscriminately extirpated, were the most disfiguring feature. The
river, vocal as it circled the town, was still bordered by shrubs
and ferns of unique species, and where these had been thinned the
weeping willows added an alien feature like mermaids' tresses.
Their long green ropes of young leaves shaded into the darker
clover and rye on the rich river-banks. The willows away from the
stream were cropped level as ballet skirts, and with the big
acacia-trees gave a park-like beauty to the Mazere paddocks.</p>

<p>Philip progressed thoughtfully under an avenue of various trees,
the early hop-leaves of some giant elms a miracle of loveliness
against the sun. Yes, it would be strange to be without
Greatgrandma&mdash;like the end of a dynasty. She had held so many
of the family together in the cluster of homes. The disposition of
the property would make a scatter inevitable. In the nature of
things the old lady's death was due. A quarter of a century ago
Grandpa Mazere had died, and every Christmas since, a bumper
gathering had been rallied on the slogan "It might be Grandma's
last." It was a family, nay a town, joke.</p>

<p>Philip looked away over the rich flats where the main street
carried the road across the white bridge and hid it among the lanes
high and wild with perfumed English hedge roses planted by the
original Mazere's English gardener, Grubb. The road came to sight
again round the foothills, and finally disappeared beyond Saunders
Plains in the Nanda ranges, still little troubled of man. His
glance circled to where Brennan's Gap let the Wamgambril through to
Stanton's Plains, then on to the endless ramparts of the Bogongs
and Muniongs Monarowards, whence his mother's people came. The
settlers had scarcely made a scratch on that region yet.</p>

<p>Too much rain again promised too much grass, with smut in the
wheat, the maize flattened, the fruit watery, aphides on the apples
and peaches, bottle and fluke and foot-rot threatening the sheep,
but the season was glorious at its inception. Surely the English
meadows that Grandpa had talked so much about could not be more
vivid than the valleys and foothills of Bool Bool? The pink of
peach and almond blossom brightened the dark river foliage where
seedlings had sprung up and laid a feast for possums and birds.
From every backyard came the cackle of fecund hens, and many
turkeys roamed the knolls amid the sheep of the Mazere runs, and
contested the right of the town common where Stanton Street became
the Mungee and Coolooluk road.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>The Big House and New House and Young Philip's at Three Rivers
homestead were crowded to every sofa, all but that portion
comprising the dining-room and billiard-room, long known to the
wits as the Town Hall of Bool Bool. Here the little old lady, a
friend to all, known so long and known only as completely good,
held her last reception in state. Her daughters and granddaughters
and great-granddaughters had made a coverlet of purple violets
adorned by a cross of white ones. Violets grew in every waste nook
about the gardens, which had spread regardless of space. When a
continent stretched round untouched, what need to consider the
disposition of a few roods or acres? Never were such masses of
English violets of such perfume as known to the valley of Bool
Bool. Folks there could tread on violet carpets as in ordinary
places they step on lawns.</p>

<p>Queen Victoria and her consort looked down upon Great-grandma
resting upon her trestles. The royalties were flanked by some old
steel engravings and by the popular Lord Carrington&mdash;very
grand as to epaulets&mdash;and by his lady, very slim as to waist.
A rich array of brass candlesticks still shared the high mantel and
the old chiffonier with vases and cruets of twelve bottles each,
though Three Rivers had been a pioneer with kerosene lamps with
incandescent wicks. Grandpa's hunting prints and fowling-pieces
enlivened the walls, and above the doorway instead of antlers were
polished bullock horns and lyre-bird tails. The long hospitable
dining-table and the billiard-table had been placed along the walls
and piled with the overflow of flowers. The air was oppressive with
violet and narcissus, and the odour of lilac and lemon blossoms
came in through the windows.</p>

<p>Philip wondered why so many old people died in spring. Grandpa
Mazere, the old Saunderses, Stantons, and Brennans had all passed
in spring. The perfume of spring flowers was reminiscent of
funerals to him. There was much to do and he turned from meditation
to his duties as practising male head of the clan at Three Rivers;
his father at sixty-six was so much the slave of alcohol that he
could not be depended upon. His aunts, Isabel Stanton, Rachel
Labosseer, Fannie Rankin, with his mother, took turns in sitting
beside Great-grandma and in attending those who came to make a last
call. Every hour saw fresh floral tributes and telegrams of
condolence or new arrivals for the funeral.</p>

<p>M'Haffety's was full, and those whom the popular Mayor knew all
became his guests. "Sure, am Oi a hucksther that Oi'd charge the
frinds of her, me bist frind in the wurruld, more than me own
mother iver was to me&mdash;comin' to see her put to her last
sleep?"</p>

<p>Those anear were all accounted for. All the Labosseers and
Mungee Stantons were there, attended by Teddy O'Mara and Mr
Blenkinsop. Mr Blenkinsop had lost his standing at the Bool Bool
Show some years before and was gradually sinking to a pathetic
figure. It was left to Mrs Labosseer's sense of Christian charity
and duty to do what his own class and family had shirked.</p>

<p>Jack Stanton wired from Turrill Turrill that he was coming; so
did Ronald Dice, also down the river. Mrs Raymond Poole (n&eacute;e
Mazere) was on the way with Raymond. Miss M'Eachern was coming with
the Curradoobidgee Pooles and was to be accommodated at Three
Rivers. Alf Timson and Norah and the Neangen Healeys were at
M'Haffety's.</p>

<p>Grief cannot be so poignant for a lady of eighty-four as for a
maiden of twenty-one. Emily, the affianced of Bert Poole, drowned
over thirty years before, had been mourned with grief that
startled. Great-grandma was paid a far-reaching tribute of
affectionate respect. The sadness was more for the passing of an
institution than for a person. People honoured themselves by
honouring Mrs Mazere.</p>

<p>Mrs M'Haffety had her hands full but she took time on Saturday
night to gossip for an hour with her old crony Rebecca.</p>

<p>"Oi'm wore out with it all. Sure, they're gathering up loike for
a fair. An' whoi shouldn't they, too, when she niver missed seein'
anny of thim off, with her flowers so noice, if 'twas only a poor
lone shepherd or stockman, God bless her! 'Tis hersilf that has the
rayspict of everywan."</p>

<p>"She deserves it. We'll never see her likes again."</p>

<p>"Isabel and Rachel are foine women but the ould lady was the
rale thing. She never had to put on anny of this soide or
excloosiveness as the Mrs Mazere of Three Rivers; sure, 'twas there
to be seen, and she not the soize of three ha'pence set one atop of
the other."</p>

<p>"Did you see Bert Poole and Milly ridin' by?"</p>

<p>"Sure, didn't they call in for a word. Poole was always quiet
and frindly from a boy. There's wonderful little change in him.
He'll see manny a young wan out yet, I'm thinkin'."</p>

<p>"What did Milly look like&mdash;happy?"</p>

<p>"Happy is no name for it. Her face beamed loike a young wan that
has her heart's desire shoinin' broight, and a look of peace and
contintmint beyond her years."</p>

<p>"It's to be hoped it will last. Are there anny signs'?"</p>

<p>"Divil a bit. She has a waist thinner than y'r neck, Rebecca,
an' ye should see her horse standin' on its hoind legs, an' she as
iligant as if 'twas a rockin'-chair, and Bert on another
beauty."</p>

<p>"He might be givin' her a rest for the start."</p>

<p>"Sure, he's different from his koind if he is! Ould Miss
Macorkaran, moighty thrim and thin, was there too. Sure, her face
would cut meat&mdash;looks loike salt meat, too, rough as a man's
it is. Not natural. That beloike is why she niver married after
all. Strange how she threw over Hugh Mazere."</p>

<p>"Never could get Poole to look the same side of the road as her.
That was the same year as poor Emily was drowned. She was a real
beauty for you now, and no two opinions about it. Wonderful the
change from youth to age. I remember Jessie at the ball on Emily's
twenty-first birthday. Jessie ran Emily pretty close for good
looks. They were both better-looking than Milly."</p>

<p>"Sure, wait till ye see Milly now. She ain't perhaps as pretty
as Aileen at her age, but there is something that more stays with
ye in the look of her&mdash;satisfying, that's what it is. She
looks satisfied herself, and 'tis comfortin' to look at her."</p>

<p>"Poor old Norah Timson, is she as bad as they say?"</p>

<p>"Looks turr'ble bad. She is goin' on to see that specialist in
Sydney again."</p>

<p>"What will she do with the little one?"</p>

<p>"It can go to its grandma and Julie at Neangen. Sure, there's a
noice little thing, an' talk about praycocious!"</p>

<p>"Doesn't take after old Alf, then; he's a sleepy old
lizard."</p>

<p>"But it's takin' to see how fond the little wan is of him."</p>

<p>"Poole is one that children liked. It is a pity if he is not to
have a child of his own."</p>

<p>"Sure, give him toime. He! He! Haw! Haw!"</p>

<p>"He hasn't any time to waste if he wants to see it grow up a
little."</p>

<p>"He must sometimes feel a fool starting mathrimony with a choild
loike that, and all thim that he wint gallivantin' with
grandmothers."</p>

<p>"Did you see Aileen Stanton? I hardly knew her, she is growing
so stout. It is taking all her good looks. Tommy Roper was saying
that Dice has never been near Ten Creeks or Turrill Turrill since
the baby was lost."</p>

<p>"He had a flea put in his ear beloike, and things have shaken
down."</p>

<p>"Yes. And now Jacob tells me he wouldn't be surprised if Dot
Saunders and Larry Healey don't wind up together. I saw some of it
with me own eyes at that tea-fight to pay for the font in Mrs
Mazere's church&mdash;hein' in business&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sure, Oi wuz there meself, too. Wouldn't we all be wherever
herself asked us, she wan of your rale Christians and no
bigotry."</p>

<p>"That's true. Well, I was satin' inside the tent where they had
the flower-stalls and lollies, an' Dot came in there, too, to be
alone I should think, by the style of her these days, never sayin'
a word to anyone. Larry looked as if he had been follerin' her, for
he came in after her an' stood a little shame-faced and said,
'Well, Dot, aren't you going to speak to me?'</p>

<p>"She looked as if she wanted to get away at first, but then she
said, 'I might as well, I suppose. You've have a long spell of bad
luck.' 'Just a little,' said he. 'How are you now?' she asked, just
formal, nothing cordial. 'Not much,' says he. 'It's goin' to be a
long job and it hurts like beggary.' Then he said almost against
his will, 'I'm sorry you've been so terrible hurt.' And she turned
away her head as if she was going to cry, and someone else came in
and disturbed them and they slipped out by the side flap together.
Now, what do you think they could have meant?"</p>

<p>"Some sweetheartin' or jealousy. He means beloike the scandal
that was put upon her name through him. Young people whin they're
runnin' after each other talks as if thimbles was wash-hand basins.
An' sure, Rebecca, that scandal has been such a long toime comin'
out in the wash that you must have been mistaken."</p>

<p>"There was something in it that never came out. That's what he
meant by hurting her, most likely."</p>

<p>"Beloike it was. Sure, they'll all git sorted out in toime, an'
thim that don't will have to put up with it."</p>

<p>"It will be very interesting to see all this crowd
together."</p>

<p>"Sure, an' some of the most interesting things is thim that
niver happened at all, loike Dot's baby," and with a downy wink
Norah heaved her bulk on end and answered a call to business.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>At M'Haffety's later that night a few of the real old brigade
sifted down into a review of the years. Prendergast had arrived
with four blacks hitched to the new hearse of the leading
undertaker in Goulburn, and hailed to Gundagai by telegram on the
Southern Mail. His wife&mdash;Squinty Ellen that was&mdash;had
preceded her husband in her own buggy driven by her son, and had
gone to Three Rivers direct. The kindly creature wept copiously as
she produced a wreath of lilac packed in moss and damp cloths. She
had grown closer to Three Rivers as the yearspassed and
contemporaries thinned out. Time forces the dwindling remnants to
close the ranks in protection of the affections. In the old days of
his courting at Three Rivers, Prendergast had eaten with Ellen in
the kitchen, but with time the Prendergasts and M'Haffetys
progressed from inferiors to old friends, treasured members of the
original brigade. "I've taken a little of the froth outer them for
termorrer," Bill explained of his four-in-hand. "I don't want them
to be rarin' up on their tails, though it was a promise to the old
lady that we were to swing along at a decent pace&mdash;no crawlin'
like a snail&mdash;that was the promise between us."</p>

<p>"Poole is here with the bride," remarked Jacob Isaacs. "An' she
still like an egg-boiler in the middle. It doesn't seem as if she
can be constructed the same way as our old women."</p>

<p>"Sure, she'll come to it prisently if Poole lives long enough.
There's a rale man for ye! Handsome and strong! Sound as a hell
today, still able to hould his own with anny of thim. Remimber the
noight whin he was a lad and shwung the ould lady into the boat,
and the Yarrabongo near up to where the church is today."</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem as if we could have remembered right. Poole and
Tim Brennan&mdash;pretty game they was all right! Tim looks fifteen
years older than Bert now, but that rheumatism cripples him, an' he
always did run to corpulence&mdash;a pot on him like a coolamon."
This from Bill.</p>

<p>"You're not far off him yourself," grunted Isaacs. "Cornstalk
you were in them days. Not much of the cornstalk about you
now."</p>

<p>"You're dead right&mdash;more of the fatted alderman."</p>

<p>"Ah well." M'Haffety heaved a deep sigh. "Whin we've laid the
little ould lady to rest, you'll see a great scatteration in the
tribe of Mazere. She was the king pin. She was the queen bee
too&mdash;you mark what I'm tellin' you."</p>

<p>"They're all trash beside her," said Isaacs.</p>

<p>"Yes, they reckoned because they had a flash start, they had a
right to be cock of the walk without slogging for it. I reckon it
does a man harm to have too good a start; he camps on it, and ten
to one he never gets out of his own back-yard." William
Prendergast, vaingloriously architect of his own fortunes, had in
cordial agreement with him Isaacs the ex-hawker, and M'Haffety the
retired butcher and ex-lag.</p>

<p>"No. There's not one of the men is worth the breed of the old
cove and her we're buryin' termorrer. Young Philip is a steady
plodder, but you can see the Poole sticking out in him a mile."</p>

<p>"That's bearin' out what I say. Old Boko Poole with his one eye,
an' couldn't hardly write his name&mdash;an' look at Bert Poole
beside the young Mazeres! Is there one of them could pick a young
bride an' pull it off the way he has done today?"</p>

<p>"Sure, whin ye think of it, he is a man for ye, an' the ould
buck his father ahead of him, shwingin' up this very street with a
foivein-hand and his missus and young Raymond&mdash;that come in by
the coach today&mdash;as a kid in her arrums, droivin' loike hell.
An' Bert Poole thin with hundreds and hundreds of pounds give him
for clearin' out the bushrangers, an' all the girls woild for him
in thim days. Sure, the beautiful gurruls there were thin!"</p>

<p>"The girls is still beautiful," said Prendergast. "What about
Milly?"</p>

<p>"She has eyes and a nose in the roight place, but, och, she
couldn't hould a handle to Rachel Mazere, the toime she married the
big foreigner and wint to Monaro&mdash;she that's at Coolooluk
now."</p>

<p>Since wives were out of hearing, Jacob chuckled, "There wasn't a
man in the place wasn't dead soft on Rachel. If Labosseer had 'a'
been drownded in the flood twenty young fellows were ready to jump
into his shoes."</p>

<p>"Ye're roight! She was a propher hoigh-steppin' beauty for ye,
if ever there was one!"</p>

<p>"And Jess Macorkaran ran her close."</p>

<p>"That queer-looking old bag of bones, with a long nose, and
dried up like a piece of leather, could she ever have been pretty?"
demanded Prendergast.</p>

<p>"Ah! wasn't she! Not many of the young ones today could have
come near her. You must remember her the night of Emily's birthday
ball?"</p>

<p>"Emily's the one I remember."</p>

<p>"Sure, Jessie was all right, but Emily was lovelier&mdash;one of
your lily-and-roses beauties, with a kind word for everybody. All
the young min were mad afther her, but it never turned her head a
bit."</p>

<p>"And the young fellows were men then. These pups today haven't
any guts!"</p>

<p>"Sure, Jacob, the proof of that's to be seen in Bert Poole,
still to have the young darlin's lovin' him."</p>

<p>"It's curious how some men is born to romance," agreed
Isaacs.</p>

<p>"Sure, yes, and the rest of us git married young. Sure, we can't
all have the luck to lose our sweethearts and live romantic, and
then whin some of us is old and fat an' pot-bellied still to be
slim an' run afther by the coming belle. Though there's thim that
would run afther us now if we didn't keep our weather of
peeled."</p>

<p>"Yes, but they'd make us pay for it, Terry," said Bill. "Pay
through the nose...Yes, the Mazeres remind me of a mess of rhubarb
when it gets in-grown and you can hardly tell it from clocks it's
that thin and green. A scatterin' will do them good, an' to marry
in with some good pushful stock that will think less of itself and
for more reason."</p>

<p>"What do you reckon the family will do about the
property&mdash;put it to auction or divide it upon valuation?" said
Isaacs.</p>

<p>"Sure, there's seed for controversy there. They'll niver add to
it, by the look of things, only sit down and waste it."</p>

<p>"It won't last long," said Isaacs. "Played out is what I reckon
they are. These old early pioneers was all right as long as they
had everything to theirselves. Some of these will scratch along
like cockatoos on a piece of the property the old man got together
for them, but they won't get rich at that, and the next generation
will be working for others. You'll notice it's the coves from the
city is the ones that has the foresight with property." Isaacs had
graduated in a slum and reached Bool Bool in the early days on foot
with a pack of drapery on his back.</p>

<p>"It seems as if thim who blazes the first thrack niver has much
value of the completed road."</p>

<p>"It seems as if things works round in rings&mdash;one lot is up
in the stirrups one generation and they take a turn padding the
hoof next time. It'll all come out in the wash, I reckon. Ah well,
Terry, I'll be round termorrer to see that the horses and carriage
look all right. We'll do the last thing we can for her in the best
style."</p>

<p>At Three Rivers an honoured place among the guests was accorded
Poole of Curradoobidgee and Miss M'Eachern of Gowandale. Also
present were Hugh Mazere, the third son of the house, who had been
engaged to Miss M'Eachern in '57, and Louisa, his wife, sister of
Bert and Charlotte. The elders looked at them and wondered did
Jessie regret her spinsterhood now, or Hugh regret Jessie and the
loss of the Gowandale acres.</p>

<p>To some of the little ones this family gathering was to remain
one of their earliest or most vivid recollections. It was
considered the correct thing to show them Great-grandmamma in her
last sleep, so that in future years they would be able to say they
had seen her who had blessed them all and who meant so much to her
circle. Awed and curious, the children saw a quiet face, lined with
countless wrinkles, asleep, it seemed to them, under a wonderful
counterpane of violets. Everywhere flowers were piled.</p>

<p>"Pretty! Pretty!" exclaimed the little ones. Molly Brennan was
so small that she could only say, "Pitty! Pitty!" and Norah Alfreda
wanted to pluck a bunch of the violets.</p>

<p>"Isn't she lovely! Doesn't she look peaceful!" said the elders
as they say at all family funerals. "It would be wonderful if
everyone could live as long as she did and do as much good."</p>

<p>The first great-grandson was given a little prominence. He was a
double great-grandchild, being the son of Richard Mazere's eldest
son and of Rachel Labosseer's eldest daughter. He was a thoughtful
dreamy boy who remembered Great-granny well. He used to be brought
from Nanda at Christmas or on Great-grandma's birthday to visit
her. He would never forget going across to the Old House, piloted
by Aunt Charlotte, to find Great-grandma sitting in a chair beside
a table. On the table was a big cloth that reached to the floor,
with heavy woollen fringe and a pattern of flowers. Great-grandma
was always reading a big book&mdash;the Bible, of course&mdash;and
her feet were on a fat heavy pillow covered with carpet, called a
hassock. Dick liked the sound of that word hassock: it had grandeur
in it. As a little fellow he would walk about after visiting Three
Rivers and introduce the word into his play. Once he had taken the
hassock and sat on it under the big round table and imagined
wonderful things about animals, till his mother discovered and
reproved him, but Great-grandma had said "Bless the child!" and
cried "Bo-peep" at him and gave him sweets. They were peppermints
that she kept in a little black velvet bag hanging on the knob of
her chair.</p>

<p>The children looked at that bag when they entered the room. Like
the cruse of oil, its supply was miraculously maintained. Dick
remembered, too, the small brown wrinkled hands in mittens, even in
summer, to guard them against rheumatism, and the black lace cap on
her head covered with something mysterious, which long after he
recalled as looped baby-ribbon. He liked better the caps of Grandma
Labosseer, of cream lace with a velvet band near her curly
hair&mdash;oh, caps of considerable elegance!</p>

<p>But he adored Three Rivers. It was a wonderful place. Like a
town almost, of infinite resources. At home on Nanda on his
father's back selection of his grandpa's run, the homestead was of
the time-honoured bull-run design. When he came in the front door
he could see straight through to the back-yard, but at Three
Rivers&mdash;when he could escape from his mother, who was an
artist at bilking adventure&mdash;he could wander round the endless
verandas and peep at the bees working among the pot-plants, or peer
through Great-grandpa's telescope. He always thought Great-grandpa
must have gone out of the top end of it up to heaven. Great-grandpa
had died a lifetime ago, but his presence remained so real at Three
Rivers that Dick, an imaginative, fanciful child, of whom his
mother said, "He'll have to have all that taken out of him or he'll
never get on in the world," used to expect him to pay a visit from
heaven by way of the grandfather clock or the stairs in the Big
House. Those stairs were thrilling to Dick. Alone in the place,
what a glorious time he could have had, but these visits were
always so brief!</p>

<p>It was wonderful to have so many houses as Great-grandma. Other
people had only one. At Three Rivers, counting the
kitchens&mdash;but Dick could not in his early recollection count
far enough. The gardens were similarly numerous and exciting. Near
the Old House were lemon verbena bushes. He loved to fill his
pockets with the leaves from these and smell them when no one was
looking. Near the big white gates at the back was a thicket of
shrubs where one could hide all day without being found&mdash;long
after he found their name was lauristinus. And there were lilac and
hawthorn bushes harbouring birds' nests, as well as lemon-and
orange-trees, and beyond the orchard precincts, great weeping
willows. He enjoyed pulling the long green ropes off them, they
came down so easily, and the girls used them for skipping.</p>

<p>The actual house was even more delightful, if he could only
escape from his mother into it. The billiard-room had a remarkable
table in it, covered with a green cloth and with a little fence all
round it and no one ever had dinner off it. The door-post near the
dining-room had letters on it like his alphabet-book, only not so
plain. His grandfather had lifted him up to see once, only his
grandfather's letters were not there. Grandfather said he had not
been there the day they were cut, but he particularly looked at his
Aunt Emily's letters. Everyone used to look at them and say, "Poor
dear Emily!" or "That was a long time ago," or "We were all a bit
younger than we are today." Then there would be talk about a big
flood, but it had not been big enough to wash the letters out,
though it had drowned beautiful Aunt Emily. Another it had tried to
drown was Great-grandma, but she had been too brave and got into a
boat. Uncle Bert talked about this to old Mr Brennan.</p>

<p>They talked about it at the funeral. Dick crept up to Uncle Bert
to listen. Mr Brennan was nursing his little granddaughter, Mollie,
only two she was, but everybody made a great fuss of her and was
always asking her to sing, and she sang, "Way down upon the 'onnee
river", and everybody applauded and said she had a voice like a
grown-up. Other songs were too hard for her to say the words, so
she sang the words with goo-goo baby talk&mdash;silly, Dick thought
it, but old Mr Brennan acted as if Molly were an angel. After
singing she jumped off her grandfather's knee and held her face up
for Dick to kiss, but he ran away. Her hair was a funny reel
colour; what had she clone to make it nasty like that?</p>

<p>Dick, at the time of the funeral, was passing through a
sub-pubescent phase which made him suffer acutely from these horrid
little girls. There was another, worse than Molly Brennan. Her name
was Norah Alfreda. She said she was nearly three, but Dick
dismissed that as brag because she was not as big as Molly. Her
father and mother made a silly fuss of her too. Dick puzzled why
there should be this fuss over girls, who were obnoxious to
him.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning Dick sat on the veranda by the Old House and
coveted a bird's nest going on apace near by, and looked after
Lawrence John and kept him from the bees. Lawrence John could not
see so very well, and also suffered entotically because he had been
lost, and dingoes might have devoured him, only somehow they had
not. Lawrence John did what he was told in a fascinating way alien
to the girls, and had a little more size, and his guardian was
content with him. Dick was old enough to meditate now, and
fanciful&mdash;too fanciful to be healthy, his practical elders
considered. He was saying good-bye in his heart to every loved nook
and object at Three Rivers, not alone because Great-grandma was
dead but because his parents were leaving the district, and this
was a farewell visit to Bool Bool. Dick's heart swelled with a
romantic melancholy that he was poignantly enjoying till round the
corner came Grandma Labosseer and Norah Alfreda's mother with Norah
Alfreda herself, at least that was her real name, but her mother
called her "Pigeon Pie", and Norah Alfreda was so silly and little
that she did not mind. The grownups were talking and Dick was
unnoticed till that annoying Alfreda caught sight of him and began
kicking up a bobbery. The grownups could not make out for a while
what she wanted, but Dick had known instantly, and sat
petrified.</p>

<p>"She wants a kiss&mdash;what a funny little girl&mdash;but where
is Dick?" The awful little creature pointed straight at him.</p>

<p>"Oh, there he is! Come on, Dick, the little girl wants to kiss
you." She ran to him holding up her face. Dick said he hated her.
If no one had been looking he could have pinched that horrid little
face held up in such a silly way.</p>

<p>"Kiss the dear little girl, Dick," commanded Grandma
Labosseer.</p>

<p>Dick sat outraged, a hand tight pressed to the seat on either
side as a brace against this unwarrantable attack. Norah Alfreda
began to whimper.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Pigeon Pie. We'll go and see what Daddy has for
us." But Norah Alfreda's wail increased in volume.</p>

<p>"Come on, Dick. Kiss the little girl at once. Surely you are man
enough for that&mdash;a great fellow like you!" Grandma turned to
Norah Alfreda's mother and nearly laughed, but not quite, because
Great-grandma was dead, and said, "It won't he long before the
trouble will be to keep him from kissing the girls." What could she
mean by that? Did she anticipate total collapse of his manly fibre?
But no one ever gainsaid Grandma Labosseer. Her pronouncements
carried, and her phrase about being "man enough" put the thing on
another basis.</p>

<p>"Run and kiss him. He won't bite," she advised Norah Alfreda.
She obeyed, but when she neared Dick she changed her mind. He
seemed big and uninviting. She looked up at him, thinking about
it.</p>

<p>"I won't kiss you," she said quite plainly. "I don't like you.
You are too big and nasty."</p>

<p>To be all taut to endure that horrid soft face slobbering on him
and then coolly to be spurned as too nasty to kiss! Dick darted
forward and implanted a rough mouthy kiss upon Norah Alfreda's
nose. Her outraged howl startled her doting mother.</p>

<p>"What did you do to her?" demanded Grandma Labosseer.</p>

<p>"I only kissed her."</p>

<p>"You must have bitten her." Grandma had no high opinions of
boys, though her own sons were held up as marvels of probity and
capability.</p>

<p>"No I didn't," he maintained, and was renowned for truthfulness.
When other villainies were thick as sheep ticks upon him, his
unabashed confession generally proved mitigating with his Grandma
Labosseer. She hated liars. "You can lock against a thief," she was
wont to say, "but there is no protection against a liar!"</p>

<p>"He kissted me," howled Norah Alfreda, "and he's big and nasty
and I don't like him."</p>

<p>"You mustn't be a silly little girl, crying for a thing and then
not wanting it," soothed her mother. Norah Alfreda wanted to be
carried, but her mother said she had such a pain in her side that
this was beyond her.</p>

<p>"She'll not be the first of her sex who'll cry for getting too
much of that sort of thing after wanting it," remarked Grandma
Labosseer as they went round the corner.</p>

<p>Soon Dick's mother appeared and took him for one more look at
Great-grandma, impressing upon him that she had gone to heaven and
that he would never see her again. Dick felt he ought to cry, but
he was too interested wondering what Great-grandma's soul was like,
and imagining it shooting out of the telescope to Grandpa up among
the stars where heaven was.</p>

<p>Poole went in to see his old friend last of all, and alone. The
part of his life in which the old lady had been a leading figure
had passed before his wife had been born. There were anomalies in
the retrospect but Poole did not permit them to go deeper than
wistfulness. Since he had taken his decision he had not wavered in
serene purpose. All eyes were upon him and Milly, and all were
agreed that there was no flaw in what they saw. There was a feeling
that the marriage was a reward to Poole and a happy refuge to
Milly. The radiance of Milly's face reflected her heart. Poole's
visage, always the dial of mental machinery in which there was
rarely a grain of sand, and of a comeliness not yet sadly impaired
by age, showed visible rejuvenation as when inward harmony is
leavened with adventure.</p>

<p>He went from the silence of his old friend into the night under
the stars where thirty-seven years ago he had gone to find Emily on
her twenty-first birthday. He recalled that night. The stars were
ever the same&mdash;the stars and the song of the river as it
foamed round the bend, its voice increased tonight by a spring
freshet. This hour in the garden was for Emily, drowned long ago in
Mungee Fish Hole, and for her mother, always his friend, on whom he
had paid his last earthly call. He must put that part of his life
away in the thankful memories of yesterday. Tomorrow would be for
Milly. With her he would bask in this afterthought of sunlight
tendered by a sunset held off beyond the appointed hour.</p>

<p>"No doubt they are happy now, but in the nature of things it
can't last," Grandma Labosseer was remarking. But as for that,
Poole had taken a decision, and&mdash;the gods have their
favourites.</p>

<p>"Ah me, tomorrow afternoon," said Arthur Rankin to his wife
Fannie (n&eacute;e Mazere), that night as he turned in. "She looked
so peaceful, but all those flowers made my head ache. They have put
them in milk-pans to keep them a bit fresh. That's the last of the
old folks. No more tales of your mother coming up the country in
the bullock-dray, and the blacks feeling her curls, and her going
to help people at the risk of her life, or your papa reading the
Riot Act and changing his will."</p>

<p>"No. They leave a great blank. It's the young people's turn
now...Did you notice our Rachel and Matt Dice?"</p>

<p>"I didn't. What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"They're much too thick. I don't favour this cousin business. It
will be better for us to be a little cool."</p>

<p>"That would only help things along, Mother. Remember when I was
courting you and the old man flung that dipper of mustard of his in
my face, yet here we are together in spite of it all, old girl...I
don't feel like throwing mustard at Matt."</p>

<p>"Her Aunt Rhoda might take her to Sydney for a change and let
her see someone else."</p>

<p>"Humph!" Aunt Rhoda's hubby, Raymond Poole, was a successful
barrister, Arthur only a country solicitor, and brother-in-law
jealousy operated.</p>

<p><b>*</b>
</p>

<p>The sun shone radiantly for Great-grandma's last public
function. Bill Prendergast felt her passing as deeply as did any of
her sons and daughters as he and Terence M'Haffety wept
unaffectedly together and inspected the funeral coach-and-four. The
horses, with long-flowing tails superbly put on, arched their necks
under the feathered tufts. Their hoofs were polished, not a speck
was on their glossy hides, they moved like a poem with elastic
stride, as good-tempered and well-mannered as well-born.</p>

<p>Cornstalk, true to his promise, and though preserving decorum,
drove at a graceful pace. There were few to dote on the beauty of
the team as they passed, with their light burden, for all were in
the procession, but they saw the hearse as it dipped into the
hollow and climbed again and swung into Stanton Street and out of
that again at right angles for the church service; and da capo as
they returned upon their tracks to the cemetery.</p>

<p>There was something gallant in the last ride of the little old
lady, of late stiff with rheumatism and age, swinging along thus
bravely in accordance with her wish, something equally gallant and
affectionate in her old friend officiating for her.</p>

<p>The native violets, not yet extirpated, still grew in the
graveyard and peeped into the grave.</p>

<p>Mrs Jacob Isaacs, looking round the gathering, felt sadness
invading her marrow as she totted up the dates. Thirty-seven years
since Emily Mazere had opened the new cemetery, and now it had a
population as big as had walked the streets of the township then.
What a lot were gone! The Mazere interments were specially clear in
her mind.</p>

<p>To Poole they also came back vividly. He had had his sister
Charlotte's arm in his on those former occasions of old Mazere's
and Emily's making, while his brother-in-law, Philip, had stood by
the old lady they were burying today. Relieved of this duty, he now
clove unto his wife, as a man was enjoined to do. The place had not
changed so much except for the ringbarking of the trees, taking
with it the birds, though one or two old magpies still occupied the
ungrubbed giants in the enclosure and were building their nests as
of yore.</p>

<p>Prendergast could not trust his horses to stand and his heart
was heavy, so after delivering his passenger he went back to
M'Haffety's. While Poole listened to the clergyman, his gaze rested
upon the horses as they swung along down into the hollow, where in
the old days had been a slip-panel, but now was a culvert. They
climbed the slope again, tossing their crested heads in the
sunlight. Grace and beauty, strength and youth, health and
happiness were in their message, as eternal as death and change and
decay, so it seemed to Poole. Each was part of the weft of life,
which went on and on for ever, even as the song of the river
falling round the bend like a far sweet wind from paradise. Yes,
there was youth and joy as well as tragedy and sorrow and old age,
and would be for ever, each to be taken as it came with no backward
glances of regret and melancholy. That, he felt, was the little old
lady's unconscious message as he watched that lilting four-in-hand.
She had never croaked, but met each happening with faith and
courage. She gave all who had known her a lot to live up to.</p>

<p>The song of the river was a symbol of continuity and of
peace&mdash;with its memories of yesterday. For tomorrow, the
immediate tomorrow&mdash;he looked down at the soft flower-like
young face and tenderly pressed the little hand on his arm.</p>

<p>Milly! Thank God!</p>
