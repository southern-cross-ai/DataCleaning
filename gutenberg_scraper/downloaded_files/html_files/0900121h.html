<h3><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>PREFACE.</h3>
<p><small>THE</small> following observations are extracted from
the journals of some expeditions from Port Jackson, mostly
undertaken by order of His Excellency governor Hunter, for the
purpose of exploring the neighbouring coasts. They are here put
together under different heads, for the convenience of those who
may be amongst the first to use this navigation; and to serve as
an explanation to the charts of Van Diemen's Land, Bass's Strait,
and those parts of New South Wales, which have lately been
examined by the officers of His Majesty's ship Reliance.</p>
<p>The charts are not given as perfect, but as containing the
form and situation of what was really seen, as near as could be
ascertained. When it is considered, that no time-keeper could be
procured for these expeditions, and that the vessel in which most
of the work was performed, was not of twenty-five tons burthen,
great accuracy in the longitude will not be expected; as a proof,
however, that every effort was made to avert errors; it is proper
to remark, that from the northeast cape of Van Diemen's Land,
named Cape Portland, by governor Hunter, round by the west, to
the South-west Cape, the sloop was kept close to the shore, and
brought back every morning within sight of the same point it had
been hauled off from on the precedeing evening. By which means
the chain of angles was never wholly broken; and the
dead-reckoning from Port Dalrymple, being corrected by these
bearings, placed the South-west Cape in the same situation as
captain Cook, within 5' of longitude. This was an unexpected
agreement, and must not be looked for in the relative situations
of the islands in Bass's Strait; and more especially of those
which are not in sight from Van Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>The rottenness of the deep-sea line, with which the sloop was
supplied, will account for the very few soundings which are
marked in the strait; independently of the small number of the
crew, and size of the vessel.</p>
<p>The bearings in the following memoirs are always as given by
the compass, unless it is otherwise particularly expressed.</p>
<p>If the information here brought forward should be thought
little, or imperfect; it ought to be remembered, that that little
was gained, under very disadvantageous circumstances, by the
voluntary labours of a few individuals; whose only stimulus to so
hazardous an undertaking, was the disinterested spirit of
discovery.</p>
<p>If seamen find themselves assisted by these observations and
the charts to which they are attached, in conducting ships along
new coasts, and into new harbours, it is hoped, that inaccuracies
in language and in style will be allowed to pass without severe
censure.</p>

<br>
<h3><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>VAN DIEMEN's LAND [I]</h3>
<p>THE south-eastern parts of this island, received the name of
<small>VAN DIEMEN'S LAND</small>, from Abel Janson Tasman, who
discovered it more than a century ago. Since that time, captain
Furneaux and others have enlarged our knowledge of the south and
east coasts, at different periods; but, though suspected of being
separated from New Holland, Van Diemen's Land was not known to be
a distinct island, until its circumnavigation was lately
accomplished in a small sloop, called the Norfolk, by the order
of governor Hunter. It is now found to be thirty leagues distant
from any known part of New South Wales. It contains something
more than 18,000 square miles of surface; and as far as could be
observed, Van Diemen's Land appears to be superior in fertility
to the same space of ground in any known part of New South
Wales.</p>
<p>A long swell from the south-westward does mostly, if not
always, roll in from the southern Indian Ocean, upon the western
shores of Van Diemen's Land; and as there is no known place of
shelter upon this coast, it becomes extremely dangerous to
approach it. The shore in general, is rocky; and in many places
there are reefs lying three or four miles off it; but there are
also patches of sandy beach; more especially from the black
cliffy head, in about 40&deg; 54' south, to about 41&deg; 36':
the dangerous bight also, the center of which is in 42&deg; 4',
is mostly beach. It is more of a low than a bold coast, to the
northward of Rocky Point, but is not uniformly so; for in the
latitude of 41&deg; 30', the inland mountains approach within
three leagues of the shore; and for ten miles on each side of
42&deg;, irregular high mountains come down almost to the water
side. From Rocky Point to the southward, both the coast and
country put on a different appearance. For the country to the
northward is covered with wood, though generally thinly
scattered, but here the barren mountains come ranging out of the
inland to the sea; and from their colour and nakedness, have the
appearance of being covered with snow: it is but in patches that
vegetation is seen from them.</p>
<p>Judging from appearances, the west coast of Van Diemen's Land
is as dreary, and as inhospitable a shore, as has yet been
discovered; and the great swell sufficiently announces, that the
consequence of coming near it, between the latitudes of 41&deg;
and 43&deg;, with a south-westerly gale, and a dull-sailing
vessel, would be to be wrecked upon it.</p>
<p>A point of land on the southern part of this coast, which has
two roundish peaked rocks upon its extremity, is named Point
Saint Vincent, by governor Hunter. Its latitude is 43&deg; 16'
south. Its longitude may probably be a few miles to the westward
of what it is laid down in the chart, which is 145&deg; 58' east.
It is not improbable, but that there may be an opening round this
point; for the mountains appeared to open back sufficiently for
one, and we found a set of above twelve miles to the southward,
during a night of nine hours, when lying becalmed to the
south-westward of the point.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="map1" id="map1"></a><img alt="" src="0900121h-images/0900121h-01.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b>Flinders's Chart of the Whole of Tasmania</b></p>
<br>
<p>The latitude of the South-west Cape, by a meridional altitude
of the sun, measured from the south, was 43&deg; 29'; but as
captain Furneaux places it in 43&deg; 39', and captain Cook in
43&deg; 37', I conjecture, that from haste to get the noon
bearings before the sloops position was materially altered, a
mistake of 10' must have been made in reading off from the
sextant; the South-west Cape is, therefore, placed in 43&deg; 39'
in the chart. Its longitude there is 146&deg; 10' east, according
to the lunar observations taken in Port Dalrymple, and the
corrected dead reckoning from thence.</p>
<p>The South-west Cape projects about a mile from the high land
at its back, as a steep, narrow, point. When made from the
westward, it appears to be jagged; but when seen from the
eastward, it is supposed to bear some resemblance to Rame Head,
near Plymouth.</p>
<p>The want of ports on the west coast, and the bleak winds which
seem generally to beat upon it, appear to have prevented the
human race from inhabiting it, in the numbers that they do the
other shores of Van Diemen's Land. We saw but one certain mark of
its being inhabited along the whole coast, which was near Rocky
Point.</p>
<p>The projecting points of the south coast of Van Diemen's Land,
are of the same character with the neighbouring parts of the
western coast. They are very high, steep, and barren. The
westernmost of these consist of a whitish stone, supposed to be
quartz; whence it is, that they appear to a stranger, when at
some distance, to be covered with snow. The projections near
Storm-Bay Passage have a dark, basaltic appearance.</p>
<p>Every navigator who has hitherto passed along this coast, as
far as my knowledge extends, has kept without the Mewstone; and
they have usually supposed, that there are several openings
between the South-west and South Capes, where good shelter might
be expected; but the spaces between the intermediate high heads
are only shallow bays, which are open to southerly winds; so that
there seems to be no inducement for a ship to pass within De
Witt's Isles.</p>
<p>The De Witt's Isles are moderately high, and are mostly
fronted with black-looking steep shores; but, except those that
are mere rocks, have some vegetation upon them. In passing within
them, we looked out under the expectation of seeing seals; but
neither in the water, or on shore, was one seen. Men either
reside upon, or visit these isles from the main; for the
vegetation upon two of them had been lately burnt.</p>
<p>The South-west and South Capes lie nearly east and west, by
compass, and are eleven leagues asunder, by the log; but it is to
be observed, that what is here called the south cape, is not what
is so termed by captain Cook. If we may judge by its relative
situation to his Peaked Hill and the Eddystone, it is the next
head to the eastward that is called the South Cape by him; but
this head opened round the South Cape at east-by-north, the
variation being 8&deg; easterly.</p>
<p>The rocks lying off Tasman's Head, called the Friars, consist
of three steep, rocky islets, that have some vegetation upon
them; and two black rocks. They are frequented by many gannets;
and people also seem to have visited the nearest islet, for it
had the burnt appearance that was seen upon two of De Witt's
Isles.</p>
<p>From Tasman's Head to Fluted Cape, the course is
north-by-east, about ten miles; and from thence to Cape Frederick
Henry, N. 6&deg; or 8&deg; E., about the same distance. These
capes are all more or less basaltic; and in that part of the
south-east coast, which has hitherto been termed Maria's Islands,
we find not only the capes, but the coast between them, to be of
the same substance. The cliffs of Cape Pillar, Cape Basaltes, and
of the island lying off the former, are surmounted by numberless
columns; sometimes single, and sometimes clinging together, like
the stacks of chimnies.</p>
<p>The two capes lie nearly true east and west from each other,
and are distance ten or eleven miles. Of the bight between them,
I cannot say, whether it affords shelter or not.</p>
<p>Round Cape Pillar, the coast opens at true north; and presents
the same bold, steep shore, that fronts the southeast coast.</p>
<p>The island, in which Oyster Bay is situated, appeared to be
two islands, of moderate height. The north-east point, which is
the Mistaken Cape of Mr. Cox, is steep, and is indented like a
cock's comb. The islet which is marked in the chart as lying off
it, was not seen.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">*   *   *</p>
<p>It does not seem to be well determined which is the Frederick
Henry or Hendrick's Bay of Tasman. In the chart, I affix that
name to the space which lies to the northward of, and between
Cape Frederick Henry and Cape Basaltes; and I have extended it to
those large pieces of water, on each side of Green Head, calling
them the upper bay.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* It appears that this upper bay had been
previously visited by the French admiral D'Entrecasteaux.]</p>
<p>The observations, for ascertaining the latitude of the upper
and lower bays, were two in each. In longitude, they are placed
according to the situation of Penguin Island, ascertained by
captain Bligh, in 1788.</p>
<p>In entering this bay, there are no dangers to be feared that
are not sufficiently conspicuous.</p>
<p>Around Betsey's Island, the sea-weed grows up to the surface
of the water; but in passing between the island and the two flat
rocks that lie to the northward of it, there is from five to nine
fathoms amongst the weeds.</p>
<p>Besides various anchorages in different parts of Frederick
Henry Bay, the eastern part of the upper bay contains more than
eight square miles of anchorage, upon a bottom of mud and sand,
in from six to nine fathoms water: this part of the bay only is,
therefore, capable of affording shelter to a large fleet.</p>
<p>The opening left at the back of Woody Island, had the
appearance of being either the mouth of a river, or a passage
going out to the sea. Circumstances did not permit us to
ascertain this important point. The western part of the upper bay
must also be looked upon as unexplored: it may probably have a
stream falling into its north-west corner. The shore here is low
and sandy; but from thence eastward, rocky heads and alternate
sandy beaches become the northern boundary of the upper bay. The
southern shores of the eastern bay are mostly rocky, but not
high.</p>
<p>The sides of the entrance, from the lower to the upper bay,
are generally steep, rocky, and moderately high; but these rocky
shores are divided into distinct heads or points, by intermediate
sandy beaches: that is more frequently the ease on the west side
of the entrance.</p>
<p>No run of tide was observed in Frederick Henry Bay; but there
is some rise and fall, perhaps two or three feet.</p>
<p align="center">*   *   *</p>
<p>The wood does not appear to be much calculated for other uses
to a ship than fire wood. It can be procured in every part of the
bay.</p>
<p>A small stream of fresh water runs over the rocks, into the
arm near Gull Island; but the shallowness of the arm towards its
head, makes it difficult of access. This is the only fresh water,
for ships, that was seen in Frederick Henry Bay: but the heads of
the greater number of the coves remain yet to be examined.</p>
<p>The country on the eastern side of the bay, is stony; and,
wherever we landed, is wretchedly barren. The islands have a
better appearance. Smooth Island, contains about one hundred
acres of ground, that might answer for a garden: its soil is
shallow and sandy. Sloping Island has a pretty appearance.
Betsey's Island is really a fine spot; although so high and
steep, that it is scarcely accessible, except at the north end.
Its top is well covered with timber, and fine grass; and it seems
to have a moderate depth of excellent soil. The length of this
island is about one mile, and the view from its high land is
extensive.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Some account of the inhabitants &amp;c, is
included in that of the Derwent River.]</p>
<p align="center">*   *   *</p>
<p>The River Derwent appears to have been the discovery of Mr.
Hayes, commander of the ship Duke, about 1793. With the exception
of Herdsman's Cove, the names that are applied in this river and
its immediate neighbourhood, where taken from his chart; but in
such parts as the sloop visited, it was found necessary to make
some alterations in the terms: coves having been called ports and
bays, and creeks, rivers. The river itself, is denominated
Fletcher Hayes's Gulph, in the lower part, and Derwent towards
its head; but, as it is certainly nothing more than a common
river, I have dropped the name of gulph, and affixed Der-went
River as the name of the whole.</p>
<p>Herdsman's Cove being unnoticed in Mr. Hayes's chart, has
received a name descriptive of the country that surrounds it; and
it is the only name given by me in this part of Van Diemen's
Land: save those in the upper part of Frederick Henry Bay, and
Cape Basaltes, which are also descriptive.</p>
<p>Three observations were taken for the latitude in different
parts of this river. Mount Direction is in 42&deg; 48' south. The
mean variation of the azimuth compass and theodolite, observed on
the south side of Risdon Cove, in December, 1798, was 8&deg; 52'
east.</p>
<p>The Derwent being almost as free from any, but very: apparent,
dangers, as Frederick Henry Bay, it is thought unnecessary to
engrave the particular chart of these parts: the original plan is
upon a scale of half an inch to a mile.</p>
<p>The entrance of this river, is in depth ten or twelve fathoms,
and in width, two miles and a half; but a small part of this
space is occupied by some rocks, that lie off the point on the
east side of the entrance.</p>
<p>When the river is entered, Shoal Point seems to be the only
place of danger. It is necessary to give it a wide berth, by
keeping close over to the echoing cliffs on the opposite side.
The width of the river is here contracted to half a mile.</p>
<p>In sailing up thus far, Mount Direction will be a very
conspicuous object a-head: a gap at its top, divides it into two
roundish heads. Below this mount, is Risdon Cove, which is the
highest part to which a ship can safely go. We could scarcely
find so much as two fathoms water abreast of Mount Direction; but
when round the point, there is a channel by the starboard shore,
with not less than four fathoms in it. Below the next point, on
the same side, are some dry mud-bands; and except striking into
the mid-channel to pass these, the deep water continues on the
same side past Herdsman's Cove. The channel than becomes
exceedingly narrow, in proportion to the width of the river; and
keeps closer to the starboard shore, until the south-south-west
reach opens: it then rounds over to the opposite side. The depth
of water is from two to three fathoms above Herdsman's Cove, and
continues to be so as far up as our examination went.</p>
<p>No vessel that draws more than nine feet water should attempt
to get above Risdon Cove. It is for the use of smaller vessels,
and of ships long boats, that the channels so high up are spoken
of. A long boat may also get up the creek that falls into the
north corner of Herdsman's Cove. The greater part of this cove is
a dray mud-bank at low water; but there is a narrow channel,
leading round by the starboard shore into the creek, in which
there is nine feet water.</p>
<p>A ship may lie in Risdon Cove, out of the stream of the river,
in from six to three fathoms, muddy bottom; and from thence
downwards to Relph's Bay, both sides of the river afford
anchorage in various depths of water, between three and twelve
fathoms, on the same ground.</p>
<p>Relph's Bay appears to be a very spacious harbour, but I
cannot speak of the depth of water in it.</p>
<p>Pruen Cove, in the northern part of Storm-Bay Passage, affords
complete shelter from winds at north-east, and round by the west
to south-west; but at south, there would be a considerable sea
thrown into it, and an easterly wind would make a short
disagreeable swell. The water shoals very suddenly in the head of
this cove.</p>
<p>The water moves so slowly in the lower parts of the Derwent,
that a good sailing vessel need pay no attention to the tides. We
sometimes found the water draining down for twelve hours and more
together, and at other times, as long upwards; whilst the rise
and fall by the shore, were at the usual intervals. <i>A counter
current at the bottom appeared to be the cause of this
irregularity</i>. From Shoal Point upwards, the tides seemed to
run true, and to have some little strength, perhaps half a mile
per hour.</p>
<p>I reckoned the time of high water to <i>precede the moon's
passage over the meridian on any day, about four hours</i>; which
is more than an hour later than in Adventure Bay.* The rise is
between four and five feet in Risdon Cove.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See captain Cook's third voyage, and
lieutenant Bligh's narrative of the Bounty's voyage to
Otaheite.]</p>
<p>Every part of the shores of this river will afford wood for
the fire, in abundance; but fresh water is not so easily procured
by shipping. The river itself is fresh in that part where it
takes a south-south-westerly course; but the larger classes of
vessels can only get at it by boats, from Risdon Cove. A fresh
stream falls into the creek, which is in the north corner of
Herdsman's Cove; but the large stones at the head of the creek,
will much impede boats in filling their casks; and the high
banks, by increasing the power and altering the direction of the
wind, will make rafting very tedious.</p>
<p>Risdon Cove was our watering place. The hogsheads were rafted
into the creek at high water, filled at the following low water
time, and towed out as soon as they floated. The late rain had
made the water somewhat muddy; but it was otherwise very
good.</p>
<p>The head of the cove, called Slainforth's Bay, by Mr. Hayes,
was not examined.</p>
<p>Some rills of excellent water come winding through a rich
valley, at the back of Pruen Cove; and uniting, fall into the
head of the cove; but the shoals, which dry at low water, are a
hindrance to watering a ship at this place. It is probable,
however, that Mr. Hayes, or perhaps admiral D 'Entrecasteaux,
watered here; for there was a tree lying near the run, which had
been cut, both by a saw and an axe; and they would not have
pitched upon this as a wooding place only, when there were twenty
others about the cove more convenient for the purpose.</p>
<p>From appearances it seems, that the south-east part of Van
Diemen's Land is tolerably well inhabited. Once only, in the
upper part of the river, were we able to over-' come their
efforts to avoid us. Two women ran off screaming, but a man staid
to receive Mr. Bass and myself; and accepted a swan that was
presented to him, with great joy. He carried two small spears in
his hand, but seemed to be devoid of fear. Our fire-arms were
neither objects of curiosity or alarm; and the only part of our
dress that attracted his attention, were the red handkerchiefs
about our necks. He was a short, slight made man, of the middle
age. His countenance was more expressive of benignity and
intelligence, than of ferocity or stupidity. His features were
less negro-like than is usual in New South Wales; and his hair
was either cut or burnt very close. He understood none of the
dialects spoken in the neighbourhood Port-Jackson, or the common
words of the Otaheitean language.</p>
<p>The natives of Frederick Henry Bay, have some mode of
conveyance by water; for they had visited Betsey's Island, the
Isle of Caves, Smooth Island, and Gull Island; and, perhaps, the
others. It has been a received opinion, that the inhabitants of
this part of Van Diemen's Land have no canoes; and, had our
observations been confined to the Derwent River, we should have
joined in that opinion.</p>
<p>A few of the grey, and of the smaller red kanguroos, were seen
here.</p>
<p>The flocks of swans, in the Derwent, will be the best
dependance for fresh provisions, to those vessels that shall
visit it early. In December, and perhaps at all times, from
one-tenth to one-third of these swans are without their wing
feathers; and may be taken by a handy whale boat, whose only
weapon need be a boat hook. By swimming and flapping along the
water, and by their craftiness in gaining the wind, after being
once chased, the swans would sometimes tire our little two-oared
boat: a few shot then generally ended the pursuit.</p>
<p>The long grass that grows upon the shoals of mud, furnishes
the swans with food; and where this food is most plentiful, there
they are most numerous. We did not meet with one in Frederick
Henry Bay; but in the northern part of Storm-Bay Passage, and in
the lower parts of the Derwent, there were a few straggling
birds. It is in the shoal part of the river, from Risdon Cove
upwards, where they are found in hundreds. These swans are black,
the wing feathers excepted.</p>
<p>Ducks, black shags, gannets, red-bills, and pelicans, were
occasionally seen; principally in the shoal lagoon, at the back
of Relph's Bay.</p>
<p>The only trial that we here made to catch fish, was in the
lower part of the Derwent; and was not without success. Fish are
known to very plentiful in Adventure Bay.</p>
<p>Venomous snakes are found here, which so much resemble burnt
sticks, that it requires a close inspection to detect them. One
was taken alive, but died soon afterwards; apparently in
consequence of his own bite.</p>
<p>The banks of the Derwent are not remarkable for their height;
but on the east side, the hills rise suddenly from the water,
whilst the west side ascends gradually up to a large body of
mountain; the summit of which is four or five miles inland. This
mountain is the parent of all the streams that fall into the
river on that side; and is sufficiently high to be seen over the
land in almost all parts of Frederick Henry Bay. Mr. Bass found
it covered with large timber, to its very top. In the fresh part
of the river, the hills rise rather suddenly from the water-side;
and the country seems to be hilly, if not mountainous.</p>
<p>The borders of the river are, in general, much better
calculated for pasturage than for agriculture. They are covered
with grass, equally dispersed over a good, but sometimes shallow,
soil. The hills descend with so gradual a slope, that they
usually leave a considerable extent of valley; and the depth and
goodness of the soil, in many of these vallies, seem very fit for
the plough.</p>
<p>The stream that falls into Risdon Cove, runs out of an
extensive valley, that in the disposition of the ground, exceeds
in beauty every other that was met with. Round Herdsman's Cove,
the country is unusually thin of timber, and finely rounded into
grassy hills. Upon the tops of these hills, as upon most others,
it is usually stony; but in some of the values, the soil is
capable of a profitable cultivation.</p>
<p>The remarkably formed peninsula, that surrounds Relph's Bay,
is tolerably good ground; and about the Shoal Lagoon, there is
some of a superior depth of soil. Was a settlement to be formed
in this neighbourhood, Relph's Bay would deserve particular
attention.</p>
<p>The stone about the Derwent is sometimes basaltic, and often
contains iron. From its great weight, it is well calculated for
ballast; and in many places, as in Risdon Cove, may be
conveniently taken into a boat.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>HUNTER's ISLES.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THIS</small> cluster is named after His Excellency the
governor of New South Wales. In latitude, the isles are placed
according to four meridional observations of the sun, taken in
sight of some of them; and in longitude, according to the dead
reckoning form Port Dalrymple, corrected by the bearings along
the coast.</p>
<p>Albatross Isle is in latitude 40&deg; 25' south. Its
longitude, by the above authority, is 145&deg; 4' east. No
observations were taken to find the variation of the compass; but
in constructing the chart, 8&deg; east were allowed.</p>
<p>These isles are in general high; and the south westernmost of
them are surrounded by steep, forbiding cliffs.</p>
<p>Black Rock is a small conic-formed islet, and may be seen more
than five leagues in fine weather.</p>
<p>Albatross Isle is visible at the distance of six leagues. The
heavy south-west swell, which breaks upon the steep shores of
this rocky islet, will seldom allow it to be landed upon, and
then only at the north-eastern end.</p>
<p>The long spit of land between Albatross and Three-hummock
Islands, I judge to be an island also, distinct from the
north-west end of Van Diemen's Land; but this is a matter of some
uncertainty. The west side of this land is low, and there are
some beaches upon it. The north point is low, but rocky. On the
east side of this supposed island, the land seems to rise as it
proceeds to the southward, and the shore to become steep. The
internal parts of it are sparingly covered with a kind of
half-starved vegetation.</p>
<p>The three hummocks, on the island which they give name to, lie
in the direction of <small>S</small>. 20&deg; <small>W</small>.
by compass, nearly in a line. The southernmost of them, which is
the largest, is sloped somewhat like a sugar loaf; and may be
seen more than seven leagues from almost every direction. Off the
east side of this island, there is anchorage on a sandy bottom,
and shelter from westerly winds. Judging by appearances from the
anchorage, the ascent up to the hummocks is covered with an
impenetrable brush; over which the heads of a few stinted gum
trees are seen.</p>
<p>The islands, whose situation is nearest to the northwest part
of Van Diemen's Land, as well as the north-west part itself, must
be considered as yet unexplored; and it is necessary to observe,
that the relative positions of those islands that are more
distinctly marked in the chart, may not be correct to one, two or
perhaps three miles; for between the nouns of the 9th and 10th of
December, a long swell, and strong winds and tides, made a
considerable disagreement amongst our angles and bases; which
disagreement will, more or less, affect the whole of the lands in
the neighbourhood of this part of the track.</p>
<p>Upon Three-hummock Island, there were certain marks of its
having been frequented by men; but it is probable, that none of
Hunter's Isles have stationary inhabitants.</p>
<p>The tides run very strong amongst these islands. The flood
comes from the south-westward. It appears to be high water about
one hour before the moon passes over the meridian, and the rise
of the tide seems not to be less than eight feet.</p>
<p>Although not a seal was found upon the east side of
Three-hummock Island, yet several were seen in the water near it;
and some of a reddish bad fur, were knocked down upon Albatross
Island.</p>
<p>Sea birds are numerous amongst Hunter's Isles. There were vast
numbers of albatrosses on that isles to which their name is
given, which were tending their young in the beginning of
December; and being unacquainted with the power or disposition of
man, did not fear him: we taught them their first lesson of
experience.</p>
<p>Out of the great, and almost unknown, bight, between
Three-hummock Island and Circular Head, such an immense number of
gannets, and Mount-Pitt birds* issued, that there must be one or
more islands there, which are much frequented by them. They came
from the southward at day-light in the morning, and took their
way, round the islands, to the westward.</p>

<br>
<h3><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>VAN DIEMEN's LAND. [II]</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> north coast of Van Diemen's Land puts on a
very different aspect from that of the west or south coasts. The
long swell from the southern Indian Ocean, which strikes over to
the coast of New South Wales from Hunter's Isles, leaves this
side of Bass' Strait in smooth water. From this cause, and from
the most prevailing winds being off the land, the north coast has
more the appearance of being the shore of a harbour, than of one
that is exposed to the sea.</p>
<p>Circular Head is steep, resembling a round twelfth cake in
form, and is high enough to be seen more than eight leagues. The
cape, to which it is connected by a low isthmus, and of which it
forms the easternmost part, is smooth, sloping, and rather
low.</p>
<p>The bight between Circular Head and the next projection
eastward, is almost entirely a sandy beach; and there are also
sandy beaches half way from the rocky projection towards Table
Cape; but the shore then becomes rocky and more steep. Both
Circular Head and Table Cape, and also the rocky cape between
them, make like islands when first seen from the eastward. The
Table Cape preserves its flat appearance in every direction from
the sea. Its cliffs are steep; and it is high enough to be seen
at the distance of twelve leagues.</p>
<p>Taking that space of coast between Table Cape and Port
Dalrymple, we find a good deal of sandy beach upon it; and
although the land is very mountainous at the back, yet the shores
do not appear to be steep, in general. There is a round hill
close down to the water, five leagues to the eastward of Table
Cape; and a few miles beyond this hill, there is a range of
mountains coming from the south-westward, which break off
abruptly at the water side, and form a bluff head; but do not
project beyond the line of the coast.</p>
<p>From hence eastward, we are not so well acquainted with the
nature of the shore; and it is not impossible, but that there may
be a small opening in the bight which lies about five miles west
of Port Dalrymple: the small projecting point in that bight is
low, and made like an island.</p>
<p>On each side of Port Dalrymple, ranges of hills from the
mountains inland, approach near to the sea; but from thence
eastward, the coast may be called low; and is, with few
exceptions, a sandy beach which continues round Cape Portland,
and as far beyond it as I have seen the coast. The principal
exception, is a stony head lying ten miles to the north-eastward
of Port Dalrymple. This head is not remarkable for height; but it
will easily be known by its being the only stony projection in
the neighbourhood, and from having a small rocky islet lying
two-and-half miles off it, north-west-by-west, by compass.</p>
<p>The great similarity that one island or piece of land, has to
some other in its neighbourhood, is often remarked; and this is
exemplified in the likeness between Isle Waterhouse and the islet
that lies three or four miles to the westward of it. They are
both moderately high, and level at the top. The shores of the
islet are rocky; but the inner point of Isle Waterhouse is sandy,
and seems to run off shoal. We passed between this isle and the
main, our shallowest soundings being four fathoms, and the bottom
sandy; but I would not recommend it to any ship to follow our
example, unless from necessity. I think it still less safe for a
ship to attempt passing between Cape Portland and the isles that
lie off it. The northernmost of these isles is divided into two
parts, nearly equal in size, whence it may be called double isle.
From this double isle, and the sands near it, there appeared to
be shoal water connecting them with the Swan Isles. The rippling
water, which is marked in the chart as a curving line from the
double isle, is about two cables lengths broad. Upon that part of
the ripple over which we passed, there was nine fathoms; and the
water appeared to be as much agitated there as in other
parts.</p>
<p>The latitude of the largest Swan Isle is 40&deg; 43' south,
and its longitude, reduced back from the observations in Port
Dalrymple, 148&deg; 13' east. On the south side of this isle,
there are two small sandy bays. Our anchorage in the eastern bay,
was a short quarter of a mile from the shore, in four fathoms:
the points of the island bearing, by compass, N 66&deg;. E. and
S. 22&deg;. W.; and the easternmost part of Van Diemen's Land S.
49&deg;. E.; the bay is, therefore, open to easterly winds.</p>
<p>On this part of the north coast the tides run strong; and on
the west side of Cape Portland, the ebb takes so northerly a
direction, that we expected to have found a considerable opening
in the bight; but from Isle Water-' house, where the flood comes
from the eastward, to Circular Head where it appears to come from
the west, there seems to be very little tide running. A line
drawn from Isle Waterhouse to the head, will probably be a
boundary, to the southward of which, no tide will be perceptible
on this coast.</p>
<p>In speaking of the more interior part of the north coast of
Van Diemen's Land, it will be convenient to divide it into three
portions. That part of the country from' Table Cape westward, has
almost as sterile an aspect as the west coast, or as Hunter's
Isles. It is for the most part rocky, and is in many places bare
rock. This was the appearance of the country from the sea.</p>
<p>In height, this part of the coast rises as it proceeds to the
eastward. It may be called a low and level country in its western
parts; but, as before observed, is high enough at Table Cape to
be visible more than twelve leagues.</p>
<p>The second portion of the coast, from Table Cape to Port
Dalrymple, is mountainous inland; but almost everywhere has a
fertile appearance, being well covered with timber down to the
water side.</p>
<p>About four, or perhaps more, leagues inland, there is a
remarkable hill, which opens round Table Cape at S. 16&deg; E. by
compass, as a sharp-pointed sugar loaf; but when it bears to the
westward of south, it becomes flat-topped. From the shape and
height of this peak, it might be thought to have once been a
volcano.</p>
<p>Stretching from hence, round the head of Port Dalrymple, the
inland presents nothing but mountains; the back ridges topping
over those that are nearer to the sea. The head which forms the
west side of the entrance into the port, is of considerable
height; and the ridge of back mountains, which it partly hides,
is of great singularity. This ridge is formed into peaks,
hummocks, and knobs, of uncouth shape, in its more western parts;
and loses itself behind the head in a kind of table land. These
peaks and knobs are generally bare of vegetation, and from the
brilliancy with which they reflected the sun's rays, on his
appearance after rain, I judged them to consist of quartz, like
the mountains of Furneaux's Islands.</p>
<p>The same kind of mountains are seen reaching to the eastward,
from the upper part of Port Dalrymple; and they also extend so
far to the northward, as to be visible from Cape Portland.</p>
<p>In the third portion of the north coast, from Port Dalrymple,
eastward, the hills form a gradual descent from the inland
mountains towards the low land near the sea coast. These
descending hills are well covered with wood; and though the soil
seems to be sandy, yet it appeared to be above mediocrity. There
are are also some grassy tracts of open ground, that are prettily
varied by clumps of wood and large single trees standing here and
there: these open tracts were principally seen on the east side
of Cape Portland.</p>
<p>There is usually a space of from one to five miles, between
the feet of these green hills and the sea; which space, in the
whole of this portion of the coast, seems to partake of the same
sandy nature as the shore. Some hillocks on the pitch of Cape
Portland, and on the projection opposite to Isle Waterhouse, are
exceptions to its being universally low land.</p>
<p>The smokes which ascended from various part of this coast,
gave us to understand that it was inhabited. These smokes were
most numerous between Port Dalrymple and Isle Waterhouse.</p>
<p>Several overgrown hair seals and some flocks of birds, which
were sitting upon the rocky islet that lies between Isle
Waterhouse and the main, were an indication, that men do not
often, if ever, visit the islet; and consequently, not the more
distant isle. On the largest Swan Isle, we found no marks of men;
but there were wild geese, penguins, and Mount-Pitt birds, upon
it; and according to the information of a man who had crossed
over from the wreck at Preservation Island, it abounds with swans
at sometimes. Upon this man's authority, I called this small
cluster the Swan Isles, in February 1798; but on visiting it in
the November following, we found no indications of its deserving
so respectable a name.</p>
<p>On passing the rocky islet, which lies two-and-half miles from
the stony head near Port Dalrymple, a few seals were seen sitting
on the top of it.</p>

<p>Port Dalrymple is the only harbour that the north' coast of
Van Diemen's Land is at present known to afford. It was so named

<p>Low Head is a projection of sloping land on the east side of
the entrance into the port; its latitude by six observations
taken near it, is 41&deg; 3&frac12;' south.</p>
<p>The observations for ascertaining its longitude were taken
with Troughton's sextant, No. 251, of nine inches' radius, and

survey, will be as follows:</p>

<br>
<p>The entrance of this port is by no means conspicuous; and it
is difficult to find good marks whereby it may be found. It has
been observed, that ridges or chains of hills from the mountains
inland, approach nearer to the sea on each side of Port
Dalrymple, than they usually do in its neighbourhood. When the
entrance bears to the southeast, that chain which comes to the
back of Low Head appears as a cluster of irregular hills, with
the blue tops of the higher mountains peeping over them; and the
ridge which comes down to the sea on the west side of the port,
puts on nearly the same appearance. Again, the stony head which
has been mentioned as having a small rocky islet lying
two-and-half miles to the north-west-by-west, is the only
projection on the east side of the port that is not sandy; and on
the west side, is the very singular range of mountains, before
mentioned, which is formed into uncouth shapes and peaks. These
marks, taken together, are the best that I can give for knowing
the entrance of the port by, in addition to its latitude and
longitude, and the trending of the coast on each side of it, as
laid down in the chart.</p>
<p>It will sufficiently appear by the chart, that this port is
difficult of access. In addition to the particular chart, I would
observe to a vessel going in, that the greatest part of the
shoals are covered at half tide; it is therefore by much the best
time to enter the port with the first of the flood, or even a
little before that.</p>
<p>A line drawn from about two cables lengths off Low Head, for
the middle of the harbour, will, with a little deviation, carry a
vessel almost up to Green Island. There are two passages into
this fair way. That nearest to Low Head lies amongst the patches
of weed. This weed does not grow up to the surface of the water,
but the patches are sufficiently distinguishable from the mast
head or fore yard; and with a free wind, a vessel that answered
her helm quick might avoid running over them, by yawing to one
side and the other. On coming into this port the last time, we
ran through them before a gale of wind at west-north-west, and
saw no breaking upon any but the outer patch; which, in the
chart, is marked as a rock; I therefore conclude, that there
cannot be less than three fathoms upon them. At a much less
distance than two cables lengths from Low Head, this inner
passage may probably be clear of weed: it appeared to be so when
inspecting it from the head.</p>
<p>The outermost shoal from Low Head lies about midway to the
opposite shore. It is, I believe, dry at all times of tide, and
is frequented by shags and other birds. The outer passage into
the fair way, is, to run to within about a quarter of a mile of
this shoal, where nine fathoms is marked, and then to steer for
the lagoon beach till arrived in the fair way; which must be
judged of, by having deep water, by having the entrance fairly
open, and by comparing the chart with the land.</p>
<p>Having gained the fair way, the middle of the harbour I' will
be conspicuous; and the Middle Head also, if thee weather is not
thick. Keep a straight course for these, for' one mile and a
half, looking out sharply upon the great shoal upon the starboard
hand, from the mast head. At the same time, it is best to keep to
that side withal; and to edge more to port if the water should
shoal to five or six fathoms.</p>
<p>The northernmost of the hills, on the east shore, is also the
nearest hill to the water side. At the top of this hill there is
a gap in the trees; and when this gap bears east by-north, by
compass, a vessel will be in the worst part of the channel, and
abreast of a rock which lies a quarter of a mile from the
larboard shore. This rock is covered before half tide, and, is
not steep to; and it is more particularly dangerous, as the ebb
tide seems to set a good deal upon it. Its place will often be
denoted by a strong rippling in the water, but perhaps not
always.</p>
<p>On account of this rock it is principally, that I recommend
keeping rather over towards the shoal on the starboard hand. This
shoal being a mixture of shells, sand, and mud, upon a rocky
foundation, will shew itself to a man at the mast-head in almost
all kinds of weather; and if the vessel comes in before the tide
is much risen, the greater part of it will be dry. Therefore,
having passed the dangerous rock, keep inclining towards the
starboard shore, but paying attention to the lead, till you
approach Green Island. This island will at first appear like a
point, and the direct channel into the port will seem to be on
the starboard or west side of it; but with the knowledge that the
channel winds round on the east side of the island, it will be
sufficiently conspicuous.</p>
<p>The principal thing to be attended to, when passing round
Green Island, is to look out for the Middle Rock. This rock is
covered at half tide, like most of the others. It lies at equal
distances from Green Island, and from the two points of Outer
Cove; and is, consequently, right in the middle of the channel.
The water is deep to within twenty yards of the rock, and the
passage is clear on either side of it; but if the rock should be
covered, the safest way is to keep the island close on board.
This is more particularly necessary on the ebb tide, as it sets
over the rock on the first half of the ebb, and close past it
when it becomes uncovered.</p>
<p>After passing Green Island, there can scarcely be said to be
any danger in getting into the basin; for the points are all
steep to, and the Shag Rock is not covered till the top of high
water. A vessel may safely push in to the westward, between the
Shag Rock and the point; taking care that she borrows near enough
to the point, if the flood tide is running; and that she does not
go too near the shoal water in the entrance of the western arm,
before she anchors.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, although the entrance is certainly a dangerous
one, I confidently hope, that by attending to the chart, and the
preceding remarks, and by keeping a vigilant look out, a ship of
any size, under snug sail, may get in safely. On first entering
this port in the Norfolk sloop, we got up as high as Green
Island, almost without percieving any danger; this circumstance,
however, has often surprised me.</p>
<p>To run up the river, for I consider it to be a river above
Middle Island, there seems to be no direction necessary, but to
consult the chart, particularly about Brush Island. After passing
the Norfolk's uppermost anchorage, a boat or two should be kept
a-head of the ship.</p>
<p>The tides run so strong in Port Dalrymple, that a vessel will
hardly get in or out against them; but by their assistance, may
get against any wind; if she can carry sail. In the sea reach
more particularly, that is, from Green Island downwards, the
tides occasion strong ripplings and whirlpools. Upon many of
these we have found deep water; but it must by no means be
inferred, that a vessel need be under no apprehension of them.
The names Point Round-a-bout, Point Rapid, and Whirlpool Reach,
are descriptive of the effect of the tides in the neighbourhood
of these parts.</p>
<p>I calculate the time of high water in Port Dalrymple, to be
about a quarter of an hour before the moon passes over the
meridian on any day; and the rise of the tide to be from six to
eight feet. The ebb runs out near seven hours.</p>
<p>Outer Cove will afford anchorage for at least one vessel, on a
sandy bottom. Ships that have good boats, may lie in any part of
the basin where there is deep water; but for small craft, the
anchorage on the west side of Shag Rock is well calculated. A
vessel of even fifty tons should not attempt to go up the Western
Arm without a previous examination by boats; and a ship that
attempts the passage towards the Middle Arm, without following
the same step, would probably find some difficulty in hitting the
channel; although the line of direction in the chart, from the
south head of Deceitful Cove to Inspection Head, should be found
correct.</p>
<p>Above Green Island, the bottom is universally muddy.</p>
<p>Fire wood can be had in every part of Port Dalrymple, in as
great plenty, and as conveniently, as can be wished. Our hasty
examination did not bring us to the knowledge of any timber well
fitted for better uses: the growing trees are very heavy, and
full of gummy sap.</p>
<p>Although the country appears to be well stored with
fresh-water for all the domestic purposes that inhabitants might
require, yet it is but indifferently supplied for the convenience
of shipping, in the lower parts of the port. The fresh-water
lagoon, at the back of the beach near Low Head, is the most
convenient place we met with; but the water was inferior to some
that was procured in a shoal cove on the eastern shore, two or
three miles above Middle Island. In this latter place, hogsheads
could only be rafted off at high water; and our time and strength
being ill adapted to such a mode of proceeding, we preferred the
standing water of the lagoon.</p>
<p>For a vessel that wanted much water, or to refit, I should
think it most advisable to run up into the freshwater river at
once. It was almost drinkable at low water, at the Norfolk's
uppermost anchorage; from whence we concluded, that if
circumstances had permitted us to have gone have five or six
miles further up, the water would have proved fresh.</p>
<p>If we may form any judgment from the traces of inhabitants
that were found upon its shores, Port Dalrymple is peopled in
almost the same proportion as the ports of New South Wales. Seven
or eight huts were sometimes found standing together, like a
little encampment; but the owners of them were always absent.
Some natives once made fires abreast of where the sloop was
lying; but as soon as the boat came near the shore, they ran off
into the woods; and this was the nearest communication that their
shyness would permit.</p>
<p>Concurring circumstances seem to point out, that the men of
this place have no canoes. Middle Island excepted, the isles in
this port have no appearance of having been visited; and no tree
was ever met with in the woods, whose bark had been taken off so
as to be fit for making a canoe. The sum of our observations upon
these people, and their mode of existing, was, that they have
less ingenuity, and are more destitute of comforts and
conveniences, than even the inhabitants of New South Wales.</p>
<p>Kanguroos are tolerably numerous in the neighbourhood of Port
Dalrymple, and according to Mr. Bass's opinion, they are larger
than those found near Port Jackson. The kanguroo is only to be
procured by hunting with stout greyhounds, or by shooting.</p>
<p>Marks of the emu, or cassuary, were met with, but the bird
itself was not seen.</p>
<p>The swans that inhabit this port, will be a source of food to
its visitors for some time. Similar to those in the Derwent, a
considerable portion of these swans were without the wing
feathers. In the short intervals of time that our little
two-oared boat could be spared from more important employment, we
caught thirty-five; and as one swan will serve three or four
people for a day, they constituted the greatest part of our food.
The Middle and Western Arms, and the heads of the coves up the
river, are frequented by the swans; but they were most numerous
in 'the shoal bight above Swan Point, three hundred of them
having been counted swimming there, in the space of a quarter of
a mile square. They will probably be found to be more numerous in
the fresh water.</p>
<p>Owing to the ease and certainty with which we supplied
ourselves with fresh food by swan hunting, we did not follow
after the large flocks of ducks that where met with in different
parts of the port; these birds are shy, even here.</p>
<p>The small, white-bellied, shag, and the larger black one,
inhabit here. Pelicans, and the black, and pied red-bills, are
also found. Green Island is a breeding place for gulls; and eggs
were also found upon Egg Island. Crows, and parrots of dull
plumage, are met with in the woods.</p>
<p>Of the fish, I can only say, that our wants and leisure,
whilst in this port, were never sufficient to induce a trial to
catch any.</p>
<p>Muscles are numerous upon the rocks that are overflowed by the
tide; and the natives appear to get oysters by diving; the shells
being found in many places.</p>
<p>Amongst other reptiles, are poisonous snakes, and some brown
iguanas.</p>
<p>The Islands in Port Dalrymple would be found very convenient
to a vessel for landing sheep upon, or other live stock, during
her stay. Green Island is secure, but the grass upon it is
neither very good or abundant. Middle Island is a beautiful
place, containing about forty acres of good pasturage; but the
natives sometimes cross over to it: at low water. Was a ship to
lie at anchor near it, or were' two men to be left on shore with
the stock, it is probable, that the natives would not come near
it. Egg Island is very small, but it is secure; and the grass
upon it good.</p>
<p>This port is situated between two ridges of mountains; which,
from the sea coast, stretch inland to the east-southeast, with an
increasing elevation; and approaching nearer to each other, seem
to unite in a point; which point is, probably, the source of the
river. The high peaks which skew themselves above the ridges of
mountains, from the uppermost part of the river now visited, may
perhaps be this point; and if so, the river is marked in the
chart to but one half of its real extent: this is corroborated by
the strength of tide and depth of water at the uppermost
anchorage.</p>
<p>Hills strike off in various directions from the ridges of
mountains that bound the river on each side; in some places,
permitting its banks to open out to a considerable extent, and in
other parts, contracting it to a small channel. The river is in
one place nearly two-and-half miles, and in another a short
quarter of a mile in width, and these nearly close together.</p>
<p>The fertile appearance of the points in sailing up Port
Dalrymple, with which an eye accustomed to the rocky banks of
Port Jackson is so much delighted, is no falacious specimen of
the soil in general. A good covering of herbage, equally
dispersed, clothes the rising grounds; and the vallies are
overspread with a stronger grass, which is more particularly
adapted to the bite of large cattle.</p>
<p>The hills are generally found to be stony near their tops; and
the steep banks of the river, as in Whirlpool Reach, are stony
also.</p>

<br>
<p>On comparing these longitudes together, I determined to place
Cape Barren according to the observations in Port Dalrymple, in
which I put most confidence.</p>
<p>No good observations have been taken amongst these islands for
the variation of the compass; I consider it to have been 8&deg;
east in 1798.</p>
<p>The western sides of Furneaux's Islands usually present a
rocky shore to the prevailing winds and seas, and as far as we
know, are tolerably steep to; but their eastern sides are almost
universally a sandy beach, and shelve off gradually. There are
soundings to a considerable distance from the islands, and
perhaps they run across this part of Bass's Strait. Except some
few spots that may be rocky, there seems to be every where a
sandy bottom.</p>
<p>The southernmost of these islands, of which a particular chart
is engraved, are by far the best known amongst this large
cluster. Preservation Island is one of these, and has its name
from having saved the crew of the ship Sidney Cove, in 1797. She
was run aground between this island and Rum Island, and part of
the cargo saved. The remains are scattered about the neighbouring
shores; and have been seen as far as Wilson's Promontory and Port
Dalrymple.</p>
<p>When coming from the westward to Preservation Island, the
island is hid under the higher land of Clarke's Island. Lumps of
white rock first appear upon it, and upon Night Island. The rocks
that lie between these isles must be left on the starboard hand,
and the south side of Preservation Island kept as close on board
as the state of the wind may make prudent. A reef that lies a
short quarter of a mile off Rum Island, will make it necessary
not to haul up too close for Hamilton's Road. The anchorage is
off the sandy beach at the east end of Preservation Island, in
from three to five fathoms. This road has hitherto been the place
of rendezvous for all vessels that visit these parts, being
exceedingly well sheltered against the most prevalent winds; and
is tolerably secure against easterly winds, with good ground
tackling. The wind at south, or south-south-east, is the only
quarter whence it can do much injury.</p>
<p>Not having sounded all the way between Preservation and
Cape-Barren Islands, I cannot be certain that Hamilton's Road is
approachable from the northward; but I have no doubt that there
is a sufficient channel of eight or more fathoms between these
islands.</p>
<p>Cape-Barren Island is, in many parts, high land. The peak,
through which the lines of latitude and longitude pass, in the
particular chart, may be seen ten leagues; and the mountainous
ridge that extends from it almost to the pitch of the cape, is of
nearly equal height. A round mountain which stands on the
north-western part of this island seems to be still higher than
the peak.</p>
<p>There are various places between this island and those south
of it, where a vessel might anchor securely when the wind
inclined either to the northward or southward of west; but Dent's
Bay seems to be the best anchorage attached to Cape-Barren
Island. To go from Hamilton's Road towards this bay, no better
directions can be given than to keep a good look out for the
shoal water, and to compare the chart with the land as you
proceed. A vessel may pass very near to Battery Isle, in nine
fathoms; and if she has a westerly wind, it will be necessary to
haul close around Sloping Point, and keep in with that shore till
abreast of the rocks, at the back of which is the anchorage. My
information upon this place is from Mr. Simpson; according to
whose survey and surroundings, a ship may be safe here from every
wind, and the least depth, at low water, is four fathoms.</p>
<p>The Passage Islands are low; and at a distance, will be judged
to be but one island. A little sandy bay in the western island,
is well adapted for small vessels to ride in. It is sheltered
from all winds, except those between south-south-east and
east-south-east.</p>
<p>Between the Passage Islands there is a sufficient channel for
any ship; and I have no doubt, but that there is a still deeper
one between Inner Rocky Point and the eastern island; although
nothing larger than a rowing boat has yet passed through it.</p>
<p>Upon one of a small cluster of low islands, subordinate to
Furneaux's Islands, is a mountain, conspicuous for being the only
considerable eminence upon them, and remarkable for its uniform
roundness. It received the name of Mount Chappelle, in February
1798, and the name is since extended to the isles which lie in
its immediate neighbourhood. The passage amongst these isles,
through which the track is marked in the the chart, is safe for
any ship with a leading wind; being two miles in width, and
having more than ten fathoms in it.</p>
<p>The water is very light coloured, both amongst these isles and
several miles to the westward of them, the bottom being a white
sand.</p>
<p>The largest of Furneaux's Islands seems to be superior in many
respects to those that have been mentioned, but our knowledge of
it is very confined. Mr. Bishop, commander of the snow Nautilus,
passed through the strait between it and Cape-Barren Island, in a
boat; and from him we learn that there are many rocks and isles
in it, whose exact situation and form are not ascertained; but it
appears, that there is a safe passage through the strait, and
some well-sheltered anchoring places in it.</p>
<p>The great body of the large island is high; but neither on the
north-western part or on the east side, does the high land come
close to the water side. Sandy beaches, almost uninterrupted,
skirt these parts of this large island. The west coast is
exceedingly high; and overtopped with peaks and knobs of more
varied shape and more bare of vegetation, than even the interior
mountains to the west of Port Dalrymple. It was our fortune also,
to see the effect of the gleaming sunshine amongst these
mountains, after they had been bathed in rain. The spectacle was
magnificent. At the moment, we could not blame the sterility that
produced so beautiful a scene.</p>
<p>The strait that divides this large island from that of
Cape-Barren, was hastily examined by Mr. Bishop, commander of the
snow Nautilus. From him we learn, that there are many rocks and
isles in it, whose exact situation and form are not ascertained;
but that it also contains a navigable passage, and many
well-sheltered anchoring places: one of these anchorages is in a
bay on the south end of the large island.</p>
<p>The three-peaked hills on the east side of this island, called
the Patriarchs, are not unlike each other, when seen to the
north-west; but when seem from the northward, they appear as two
pyramids; and the island lying off them makes something like the
Lion's Head and Rump, when sailing into Table Bay.</p>
<p>The largest of the isles that lie off the west side of the
large island, is hummocky, and moderately high: and three
principal hills upon it all slope towards the south. The other
patches of land to the north-eastward of these hummocks are
low.</p>
<p>The Sisters were very well named by captain Furneaux, being
much alike: they may be seen eight or ten leagues. When the
Francis scooner was steering to pass between them and the large
island, rippling water suddenly made its appearance under the
bows. A strong tide might have occasioned this, but lest it
should not be so, and to caution others, a reef is marked in the
chart.</p>
<p>The tides run strong in the passages amongst the southernmost
of these islands. The flood comes from the eastward, between the
Passage Islands and the Inner Rocky Point, and continues its
course along the south side of Cape-Barren Island. In the deep
channel, and particularly off the projecting points, the tide
runs with rapidity.</p>
<p>It is high water here, about an hour before the moon comes to
the meridian. The rise of the tide appears to be from three to
six feet.</p>
<p>The tides are represented as running strong, between
Cape-Barren and the large island.</p>
<p>The lower parts of the southernmost islands are very thickly
covered with brush-wood; and in a few places, as in the head of
Kent's Bay, there is small timber amongst it. The south end of
the largest island is said to afford timber of a fair growth; and
also a run of fresh water: but the more southern isles are very
ill supplied with this last necessary article; the runs into the
head of Kent's Bay yield it more abundantly than elsewhere.</p>
<p>Under the high land of Cape-Barren, there are some swamps and
lagoons; but the water which drains into them from above, becomes
so tinged in its way, as not to be drinkable. Some of these look
like ponds of blood.</p>
<p>After continued rains, there is a swampy pond of tolerably
good water at the east end of Preservation Island; but a small
rill that drains from the higher land, on the south side of this
island, was thought to have a deleterious quality, from the
deaths that happened amongst the Sidney Cove's crew. Sand, with a
mixture of tin and copper, is found on one of the beaches.</p>
<p>No inhabitants have ever been seen, or any marks of them, upon
any of these islands.</p>
<p>Kanguroos are found upon Preservation, Clarke's, and
Cape-Barren Islands, of the smaller, red kind; and the large grey
kanguroos have been seen in considerable numbers upon the
southern part of the largest island.</p>
<p>The new animal, called Womat, by the natives at the back of
Port Jackson, is found in no inconsiderable numbers upon
Cape-Barren Island, and probably inhabits several other of these
islands. This animal has the appearance of a little bear. It eats
grass and other vegetable substances, and its flesh resembles
tough mutton. The animal is about the size of a turnspit dog; but
there is not too much meat upon it for three or four people to
eat in a day.</p>
<p>A few straggling swans have been seen about Preservation
Island, and the lagoons of Cape-Barren Island. In the sandy bay
at the south end of the large island, they are represented as
being numerous.</p>
<p>A kind of brent goose frequents all the islands that have yet
been visited. About the southern islands they are shy, having
been frequently disturbed; but on the first visit they usually
allow themselves to be knocked down with sticks. These birds are
tolerable numerous, and are excellent food.</p>
<p>The sooty petterel, called Mount-Pitt bird, is amongst these
islands in great numbers. Wherever the tufts of wiry grass are
seen, these birds will usually be found. They burrow in the
ground under these tufts, but the length of a man's arm is
sufficient to reach them. The Mount-Pitt birds, can be taken in
any numbers during the summer months, at Preservation Island, the
Passage Isles, and many other places. They come in from sea in
the evening, in numbers that surprise a person unaccustomed to
them.</p>
<p>Where Mount-Pitt birds are found, penguins will generally be
met with. There holes, however, are not in the same places; the
penguin chusing ground to burrow in which is covered with a
different vegetation. They are of a small, blue and white kind,
and are very indifferent eating.</p>
<p>Gannets, shags, gulls, and red-bills, are found amongst these
islands; but whilst the swans, geese, and Mount-Pitt birds are in
numbers, the former will not be much molested.</p>
<p>Seals inhabit most of the rock points and isles. They are both
of the hair and fur kind. Some of the latter are of a good fur,
but there seems to be every graduation. The seals were most
numerous upon the south-eastern points of Cape-Barren Island, but
they are now mostly destroyed.</p>
<p>Rock fish are caught at the west end of Preservation Island;
but from the various kind of fresh provisions which these islands
produce, few attempts were made to catch fish.</p>
<p>The stone, of which the base of Furneaux's Islands is
composed, appears to be of a quartzy nature; and it is only in
small pieces that any other kind of stone has been met with.</p>
<p>As far as my particular knowledge of these islands extends,
there surface is bare rock, in part; or sand which is covered
with brush wood; or swamps, in which small trees grow. The brush
is very often impenetrable; sometimes growing to a considerable
height, and sometimes creeping a long the ground: the tall
brush-wood is found in the inner and eastern parts of the
islands, and the scrub on the western outskirts: a proof of the
strength and prevalence of westerly winds.</p>
<p>The southern part of Furneaux's largest island is, it seems,
of a different description. Large timber trees are produced
there, and the soil is said to be of sufficient depth and quality
to grow corn.</p>
<p>In the remarks of my fellow-traveller, Mr. Bass, upon
Cape-Barren Island, is the following paragraph:</p>
<p>"In point of animated life, nature seems to have acted so
oddly with this and the neighbouring islands, that if their rich
stores were thoroughly ransacked, I doubt not, but the
departments of natural history would be enlarged by more new and
valuable specimens, than they ever before acquired from any land
of many times their extent."</p>

<h3><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>KENT's GROUP.</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THIS</small> cluster was so named by His Excellency
governor Hunter. In latitude, it is laid down in the chart
according to the mean of three observations taken in sight of it;
but there is no other authority for its longitude, than what a
dead-reckoning run to Furneaux's Islands afforded.</p>
<p>The isles that compose this small group, are rocky and barren;
and their shores are in general very steep. They are sufficiently
high to be seen eight or ten leagues distant.</p>
<p>The passage through which the Norfolk's track runs in the
chart, is safe for any ship. Its width is about three quarters of
a mile; and on sounding with seventeen fathoms, no bottom was
found.</p>
<p>In sailing through this channel, it is necessary to be careful
in carrying sail, especially with a side wind. Whilst a calm
prevails under the steep cliffs, strong flurries of wind will
rush down the gullies that intersect the high land, and endanger
a vessel that is passing them, if unprepared. The Norfolk sloop
was nearly overset, when sailing through, under these
circumstances.</p>
<p>Two small coves in the channel, which have sandy beaches at
their head, afford shelter from all easterly or westerly
winds.</p>
<p>A few straggling seals may be killed upon the rocks. The
largest of the islets which lie three leagues to the westward of
Kent's Group, is steep, and tolerable high.</p>
<p>One of the rocks obtained a distinguishing name, from the
similitude of its form to a judgment seat.</p>
<p>An extreme degree of sterility seems to prevail through the
whole of this small cluster of isles; and they seem to be shunned
by almost every kind of animated beings. Some creeping brush-wood
grows on different part of these isles.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>NEW SOUTH WALES. [I]</h3>
<br>
<p>WILSON's Promontory, with its neighbouring isles, and the
coast from thence westward, are laid down in the chart from the
eye-sketch of Mr. G. Bass, surgeon of His' Majesty's ship
Reliance; and to him it is, that we are entirely indebted for our
knowledge of these parts. I have also to acknowledge the
assistance which this gentleman's observations have afforded, in
various other parts of this memoir, particularly in the
additional remarks.</p>
<p>Between Western Port and Wilson's Promontory, a bold, rocky,
shore, and sandy beaches, seem to have almost equal divisions in
the coast. In the bights, both the shore and the back land are
low and sandy; but every rocky projection is a commencement of a
ridge of hills, which extends to the north-east till it is lost
in the country.</p>
<p>One observation, taken at the mouth of Sealers Cove, is the
authority by which Wilson's Promontory is fixed in latitude. Its
longitude is according to the supposed relative position of
Kent's Group; the Promontory having been seen at night, in the
Francis schooner, and Kent's Group in the morning.</p>
<p>The latitude of this promontory being so near to 39&deg;, has
raised conjectuers, that it is the land seen by captain Furneaux;
but unless the longitude of the promontory is more erroneous than
I take it to be, the situation of the land, which is nearly true
north from the Sisters, will destroy the possibility of its being
Wilson's Promontory. We were two or three times deceived with the
appearance of land, when off this coast; and possibly, the same
circumstance might have happened to captain Furneaux.</p>
<p>Wilson's Promontory is a great body of the same kind of stone,
of which Furneaux's Islands are composed; and it is somewhat
remarkable, that this promontory should be the only part of New
South Wales in which this quartzy substance has been seen. In
general, we meet with a softish grit, or an iron stone.</p>
<p>Although the height of this land is not such as would, by
seamen, be reckoned remarkable; yet it appears strikingly so, by
being contrasted with the low, sandy neck at its back, and other
land of the same kind in its neighbourhood.</p>
<p>About Sealers Cove, the high land appears as if cut in two,
when made from the north-eastward, and the parts to have been
moved asunder.</p>
<p>The isles that lie of Wilson's Promontory, are some of them
tolerable high, and some low. The largest of them, which is
placed ten miles to the south-eastward, is of the former class.
These isles are laid down by single bearings and guessed
distances; therefore, their relative situations to the promontory
and to each other, may probably be incorrect.</p>
<p>The northern boundary of Bass's Strait, from Wilson's
Promontory, eastward, is fronted by a sandy beach of immense
length. Some rocky points near the Ram Head, and from thence at
intervals to Cape Howe, are all that break its continuity.</p>
<p>A ridge of hills rise at the distance of twelve or fourteen
miles to northward of Corner Inlet, and curving to the eastward,
they continue in a direction nearly parallel to the shore, but
keep gradually approximately to it, till they join the hills
between the Ram Head and Cape Howe. A considerable part of the
low space between the back of the long beach, and the foot of the
hills, is supposed to be occupied by lagoons. Some of these
lagoons may preserve a constant opening into the sea, and some
others may never have any; but the greater number will be
sometimes open and sometimes shut. Lagoons of this last kind are
common upon the east coast of New South Wales.</p>
<p>The flood tide comes from the north-eastward, in the direction
of the long beach; and leaving Corner Inlet, makes a straight
course for the southern part of Wilson's Promontory. It then runs
to the west, neither curving round the promontory, nor yet
preserving its original direction, but taking a course between
them.</p>
<p>On the ebb, the east side of the promontory and the long beach
also, are left out of the stream. This tide sets past the
promontory to the east, and appears to preserve the same
direction afterwards.</p>
<p>The difference between the times of high water in Sealers Cove
and Corner inlet, is accounted for by the latter being left in an
eddy upon both sides.</p>
<p>We are but little acquainted with the inhabitants of this
coast. At one place upon the long beach, some natives came down
to the whale boat's party, with very little hesitation. It
appeared by their manner, that they had never seen white people
before; but they behaved in a friendly manner. Wilson's
Promontory does not appear to be inhabited; but upon the low neck
by which it is connected with the main, large smokes were seen,
as well as in various places at the hack of the long beach.</p>
<p>Seals, and most kinds of sea birds, will be found upon the
isles that lie off the promontory, in greater or less numbers;
and in the open lagoons, fish of the ray kind may be taken.</p>
<p>Every information that has let been gained of this A portion
of New South Wales, inclines us to pronounce it a barren coast.
To the westward of the promontory, the high land seems rocky, and
the low, sandy; to the eastward, it is almost universally sandy.
The promontory itself, is an immense lump of rocky, barren,
mountain. A few small gum trees, and other more diminutive
vegetation, do, however, often give it a deceitful appearance of
fertility to a distant observer.</p>
<p align="center">*   *   *</p>
<p>This port received its present name from its relative
situation to every other known harbour on this coast.</p>
<p>The smokes which arose from the north side of the port,
prevented any good observations being taken for its latitude; but
it will be found to be somewhere about 38&deg; 35' south. In
longitude, it is laid down in the chart by the whale boat's run
from Wilson's Promontory. Its real situation may probably be 20'
of longitude more to the west.</p>
<p>The eastern entrance of this place has so conspicuous an
appearance, by the gap it makes in the land, that it cannot fail
to be known by any one coming from the eastward. The point of the
island is a high, and rather steep cape, resembling a snapper's
head. Vessels whose draught of water was more than nine feet,
should not enter by this passage; but after sounding for
themselves, ships of a larger size' might probably go out by it.
The deep channel is winding and narrow; but mostly lies on the
island side. The sea breaks at times upon the large shoal on the
opposite side.</p>
<p>In the present imperfectly known state of the port, the
western entrance is the preferable one. A gale of wind form the
north-west would not allow us to examine it; but from an
eminence, whence any broken water must have been visible, at a
time that a heavy surf was rolling in upon the shores, no other
breakers could be observed, than those that are marked in the
sketch.</p>
<p>The general rise of the tide in Western Port is from ten to
fourteen feet. It flows till about half an hour after the moon
passes the meridian. The tides set strong up and down the large
arms, and also through the eastern entrance.</p>
<p>The soundings are frequently irregular, which is perhaps
occasioned by the cross setting of the ebb, out of the two arms
into the two outlets, and from the softness of the muddy bottom.
Mud abounds so much, that the greater part of the points are not
approachable, except at high water; and then it is at the risk of
having the boat left till next tide; for the mud runs out far and
flat, and is too soft to bear walking upon.</p>
<p>Fire wood is plentiful upon every part of the main land, but
no wood of any size appears to grow upon the inland.</p>
<p>The whale boat's crew met with great difficulty in finding
fresh water; but there was every appearance of an unusual draught
in the country, at that time. The head of the winding was the
only place where it could then be procured free from a brackish
taste. At half-tide, there is water enough for the largest boat
to enter the creek; and within it there is at all times a
sufficient depth.</p>
<p>Only four natives were seen about this port, and that at a
distance. Paths and other marks of them were common, but none
very recent. No canoes, or signs of any, were met with.</p>
<p>A few of the smaller kind of kanguroos were seen.</p>
<p>Swans are seen by hundreds, and ducks of a small, but
excellent kind, fly in thousands. Most kinds of wild fowl abound
in this port.</p>
<p>The land round the borders of Western Port is, in general, low
and level; but the hills soon rise, and increasing in height as
they recede back, the country has a pleasant appearance. In the
different places that were examined, the soil was uniformly found
to be a light, brown, mould, free from sand; and in the lowest
grounds, a kind of peaty earth. The country is but thinly
timbered; but the grass and fearns grow luxuriantly. The island
must be called barren.</p>
<p align="center">*   *   *</p>
<p>Sealers Cove, on the east side of Wilson's Promontory, affords
room for a small vessel to swing in, and water enough for any
ship to ride in safety. It is shut from all winds but those from
east-south-east to east-north-east; and it was observed that
these throw no great sea into it.</p>
<p>It is high water here nearly two hours before the moon comes
to the meridian; and the tide rises ten or eleven feet.</p>
<p>There is plenty of fresh water to be got in Sealers Cove, and
wood enough at hand to boil down any quantity of seal's blubber
that might be procured from the islands.</p>
<p align="center">*   *   *</p>
<p>Round the northernmost part of the high land of Wilson's
Promontory, lies Corner Inlet; so named by Mr. Bass, from its
situation.</p>
<p>Its latitude and longitude are upon the same authority as that
of the promontory.</p>
<p>Off the mouth of the inlet, lies a long breaking shoal. The
deepest channel is between this shoal and the promontory; the
shore of the latter, on the larboard hand, must be kept close on
board, right into the anchoring place. There is no where more
than two fathoms, or two-and-a-half, at low water; except in
holes where the tide sets strong. A vessel that could lie in this
draught of water may be completely landlocked.</p>
<p>This inlet can be called little else than a large flat, for
the greatest part of it dries at low water: the shoals and bottom
are mostly of sand.</p>
<p>Wood may be gotten conveniently enough in this inlet; and
there are two or three runs of excellent water from the high land
near the anchorage.</p>
<p>There are inhabitants in the neighbourhood of the inlet, but
we had no communication with them.</p>
<p>A few seals and Mount-Pitt birds may be found upon the
islets.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>BASS's STRAIT.</h3>
<br>
<p>THE extensive passage which separates Van Diemen's Land from
New Holland, was named Bass's Strait by governor Hunter. Mr. Bass
had visited the north side of it in an open whale boat, from Port
Jackson, in January, 1797; and the magnitude of the swell which
he found rolling in from the south-westward, strongly indicated
its origin to be from the southern Indian Ocean; and came so
strong in confirmation of the former suppositions of an existing
strait, that His Excellency the governor thought proper to order
me in a vessel to ascertain its certainty, by sailing through it.
It was with pleasure that I was able to associate Mr. Bass in the
expedition; but much more so, that our success enabled the
governor to pay a just tribute to his personal exertions and
correct judgment.</p>
<p>In giving some caution to those who may first sail through
Bass's Strait, it is necessary to observe, that as several
unknown isles and rocks may probably lie to the westward of
Hunter's Isles; a ship should be cautious in running down the
last two or three degrees of longitude, before she makes the
isles.</p>
<p>The latitude of 40&deg; 20' is a proper parallel with a
leading wind. After seeing Albatross Island, Three-hummock Island
will immediately appear, and leave no doubt as to what land it
is.</p>
<p>The land of considerable extent which is marked in the chart
as uncertainly known, is represented to be low land. It was seen
by Mr. Reed, in the schooner Martha; but its longitude is very
uncertain. The latitude of its south end may have some little
reliance put in it.</p>
<p>With the wind to the northward of west, it would be as well to
go to windward of Kent's Group; but after that, not to steer a
more northerly course than north-east-by-east, until certain of
being to the eastward of Cape Howe. In all cases, the long beach
is to be avoided, even if it should be a weather shore at the
time.</p>
<p>A ship bound to Port Jackson, and meeting with a foul wind,
would find Hamilton's Road a convenient place to anchor in for a
few days.</p>
<p>It may be necessary to observe to some, that I can by no means
answer for there being no rocks or islands in the middle of the
strait; or indeed in any of the blank places, except a few miles
on each side of the day track. Islands and rocks must be expected
to be fallen in with in other places; it therefore behoves every
man who has the charge of a ship here, to run with caution in the
day; and if he does run during a moonlight night, it should be
under working sail, and with the best look-out. But with every
advantage, it would be to hazardous to run before the wind in the
night.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>NEW SOUTH WALES. [II]</h3>
<br>
<p>IT was intended to have continued the description of the coast
of New South Wales, as far as the representation of it is given
in the three charts; but circumstances' having now rendered this
inconvenient, that small part of the east coast only is spoken
of, which appears necessary to a ship passing through Bass's
Strait.</p>
<p>Cape Howe is a low point of rocks and sand, but hills rise
immediately at its back. A good observation taken about two
leagues from it, gave for its latitude 37&deg; 30' south.</p>
<p>Green Cape is so named from its appearance. The land slopes
from the hills, with a smooth surface, to the extremity of the
point. Cape Howe and Green Cape lie north and south, by compass,
of each other.</p>
<p align="center">*   *   *</p>
<p>Twofold Bay, so named by Mr. Bass, from its form, is laid down
in latitude from a meridional observation taken on the beach of
Snug Cove, with an artificial horizon. Two sets of lunar
observations of the sun on the west side, gave the longitude
150&deg; 12' 43"; but it is placed in the chart according to
captain Cook. The variation by mean of the theodolite and azimuth
compass, was 10&deg; 19' east, in October, 1798.</p>
<p>The land at the back of Twofold Bay, lies much more in
hummocks than on any part of the coast near it; and a roundish
mount, which lies about three leagues inland, to the south-west,
is distinguishable above the neighbouring hills to some distance.
The outer north and south points of the bay, have dry rocks lying
close to them.</p>
<p>The shores of Twofold Bay are far from being high. They
consist of rocky points, steep heads, and sandy beaches.</p>
<p>The best anchorage is at the back of the steep, stony head, on
the north side of the bay, in Snug cove; where a vessel may be
landlocked in five fathoms, on a sandy bottom. There is room for
two, or perhaps three ships in Snug Cove, and small vessels would
go closer in; but the water shoals rather suddenly towards the
head of the cove.</p>
<p>At the anchorage on the south side, a vessel cannot be
landlocked in more than three fathoms. In deeper water she would
be open to north-by-east wind.</p>
<p>Large boats may enter the lagoon at the east end of the great
south beach, at half flood.</p>
<p>It is high water here about three hours before the moon passes
over the meridian; and the tide rises six or seven feet.</p>
<p>Wood is in abundance all round this bay. The only fresh water
that we met with, was in swamps, near the anchoring places.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of this bay much resemble those at Port
Jackson in their persons. They were friendly in the little
intercourse we had with them. Canoes are in use amongst them, and
seem to be much prized.</p>
<p>Both quadrupeds and birds seem to be scarce in the woods. Very
few marks of the kanguroo were seen.</p>
<p>There are a few ducks, teal, herons and red-bills on the
lagoons, and some small flights of curlews and plover.</p>
<p>If the quantity of fish in the bay bears any proportion to the
fitness of the beaches for hauling the sein, great numbers might
be caught by it. The success that was met with by the hook and
line, spoke rather favourably of Twofold Bay in this respect.</p>
<p>This bay will probably be of service to whalers; who, when
fishing of the coast, might be glad to get shelter from a gale of
wind, in a place whence it would take them so little time to work
out, and it is not unlikely, but that they might find some right
fish here: we saw the remains of one that had been thrown on
shore upon the rocky spit.</p>
<p>The land round the bay is, speaking generally, much more
barren than productive. The values and flats contain several
patches of good, and some few of excellent ground; but by the far
greater part is fit only for pasturage. The hills are universally
stony.</p>
