<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The following memoirs have been prepared at the earnest and repeated request
of many who felt that the simple record of such devoted lives would be for the
glory of God and the good of his Church. They are sent forth with the hope that
they may inspire others to show a devotion and earnestness similar to those so
markedly displayed in the consecrated lives of Justus H. and Calista
Vinton.</p>
<p>The verses at the head of each chapter are selected from "Hymns of Faith and
Hope" by Horatius Bonar, a little book which, during the last years of my
mother's life, comforted and cheered her in many dark hours. Her own copy,
purchased in George Muller's orphan-houses in Bristol, Eng., lies before me as
I write. Its worn binding shows the evidences of the long voyage to India and
the many jungle-journeys, during which it never left its owner's side. Marked
in many pages, it seems to speak to us, with her own gentle voice, words of
heavenly cheer.</p>
<p>I take this opportunity to thank those friends who have so kindly furnished
me with letters and reminiscences of my beloved parents, from which many of the
facts in the memoirs, especially with reference to the life of my parents in
America, have been drawn.</p>
<p>I also wish to acknowledge with thankfulness the great assistance which my
dear husband has rendered in every stage of the work. In the midst of the
labors and cares attendant upon the charge of a large parish, he has cheerfully
spent many days of patient work in arranging and making available the crude
materials by the aid of which these memoirs have been written.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<pre>
    "Be brave, my brother,
Fight the good fight of faith
    With weapons proved and true.
Be faithful and unshrinking to the death:
    Thy God will bear thee through.
Grudge not the heavy cost.
    Faint not at labor here:
'Tis but a lifetime at the most;
    The day of rest is near."
</pre>
<p>Justus Hatch Vinton has been in his heavenly home for twenty years; but his
memory, with that of his no less devoted wife, Calista Holman, is still
tenderly cherished in the hearts of those who know any thing of the first
thirty years of mission work among the Karens of Burmah.</p>
<p>Rarely have two kindred souls gone forth to their life-work so peculiarly
adapted to the scenes of hardship and trial, mingled with glorious successes,
as were these.</p>
<p>Justus H. Vinton was born in Willington, Conn., Feb. 17, 1806. Calista
Holman was born in Union, Conn., April 19, 1807. Both emphatically learned to
bear the yoke in their youth. Mr. Vinton was early led to Christ. When only ten
years of age, he was converted, and soon after united with the Baptist church
at Ashford, Conn., and even at that age evinced many of the traits which made
his after-life such a grand success.</p>
<p>At the age of sixteen, the increasing gravity of his demeanor and the
fervency of his devotion awakened apprehension in the mind of his mother, who
feared that it might be the result of failing health; but, in reply to her
questionings as to the cause of his changed conduct, he answered, "Mother, 'woe
be unto me if I preach not the gospel.'" This was the first intimation he had
given to any one of his determination to enter the work of the ministry.</p>
<p>In the year 1826, when scarcely twenty years of age, he entered Hamilton
Literary and Theological Institution.</p>
<p>He had, some time before going to Hamilton, offered himself to the church at
Ashford for license to preach. Strange to say, there was some hesitancy in
granting him a license, owing to the remarkable absence of all self-assertion
upon the part of the candidate. The venerable John G. Wightman, who was
present, was requested by the brethren to decide for them. He replied that he
had no doubt as to the advisability of licensing the young man to preach. He
was convinced that he had the grace of God in his heart; and that, as no babe
was born six feet high, there was a reasonable hope that the young brother
would grow.</p>
<p>Strange that the brethren should have hesitated to license one, of whom the
record of Madison University says, "He was pre-eminently a man of
revival-power; and probably no single life in Burmah has shown larger results
in the ingathering of souls to Christ."</p>
<p>In 1829, after the most careful thought, he appointed a day of fasting and
prayer, in order that he might learn his duty with regard to devoting himself
to preaching in the then sparsely settled West. In a letter written to his
parents he says, "When the day came, I retired that I might be quite alone with
God, that thus I might, with more freedom, pour out my soul before him in
fervent supplication for his Spirit to guide me in the decision I was about to
make as to the field of my future labor. Here it was, while upon my knees
before the Lord, that I received my first impressions that it would be my duty
to leave my native land, and go far away to the benighted heathen, that I might
preach among them the unsearchable riches of Christ. I had previously designed
to spend the day in prayerful consideration of the claims of the West; but at
this time I was so strongly impressed that it would be my duty to go to Burmah,
that during the day I could think of little else but the forlorn condition of
that deluded and infatuated people."</p>
<p>Fearful lest he might be mistaken, and being continually urged by some of
his fellow-students who were under appointment to the West, and were anxious to
have him accompany them, he concluded to defer definite decision for a year. At
the end of this period he reconsidered all the arguments presented, and decided
to go to Burmah. From that moment he never wavered. His conviction became
stronger, until, as he says, his whole soul "became absorbed in the delightful
anticipation of carrying to benighted Burmah the news of an ascended Saviour."
He paid the expenses of his college course by teaching district and singing
schools, and by supplying churches in the neighborhood of Hamilton. He
apologizes, in a letter to his mother, for not having written home for several
months, saying that his studies had been pressing him very hard, and that every
Saturday he had ridden thirty miles to supply a destitute church. In other
letters he speaks of teaching district-schools for twelve dollars per month;
and in one letter he congratulates himself greatly on having "by judicious
firmness" secured the privilege of <i>boarding all the time at one
place.</i></p>
<p>His singing-schools were very popular, and are still remembered by older
residents in the vicinity of Hamilton.</p>
<p>It has been said that "there never was a Vinton who could not sing;" and the
rich, full voice with which God had blessed him, not only helped to supply his
scanty purse while a student, but in the jungles of Burmah it won the heart of
many a wild Karen; and thousands of redeemed souls in glory to-day could
testify that Mr. Sankey was not the first who ever thought of "singing the
gospel."</p>
<p>At this time his letters home were upon one topic, and that was religion.
Frequently is the record made of the wonderful way in which God had blessed his
labors: in one revival, over seventy were converted within three weeks. Many
times he notes the fact that the singing-school had been turned into a
prayer-meeting.</p>
<p>At one time his district-school became the scene of a precious outpouring of
the Holy Spirit. This was at Laurens, Otsego County, N.Y. From the work there
begun, over fifty in the town alone were converted at the date of his letter;
and the work continued for months after.</p>
<p>These facts are not recorded as strange, but simply to show the spirit of
the man. What more unlikely field for divine grace than a country
singing-school, unless, perhaps, it be the ordinary district-school of forty
years ago?</p>
<p>Once, when home on a vacation, he heard of a church that had become so cold
and lifeless that it had ceased to hold any public service. He went to the
place, and gave out an appointment to preach. As might have been anticipated,
when the hour of service came, not a soul was present save himself. Without
appearing to think that he should have been discouraged, he sat down upon the
church-steps, and began to sing. Soon a crowd gathered; upon which he invited
them into the church, and preached so fervently, that a large number were
convicted, and a revival began which extended throughout the whole
township.</p>
<p>It was during this time that his beloved sister Belinda, who had cherished
the desire of accompanying him to Burmah, was suddenly smitten down by disease,
and died. He, at Hamilton, heard only that she was very ill. Unable to leave at
the time, he wrote the following touching letter:--</p>
<blockquote>DEAR SISTER BELINDA,--From a letter received from our dear parents,
I learn that you are upon a bed of sickness, perhaps upon a bed of death. This
is what I had least anticipated. I have for a number of weeks been thinking of
writing to you upon the glorious theme that has so enchanted both our hearts;
but alas! it seems that I have nothing more to do with counselling and
encouraging you respecting your future labors here on earth. Allow me, then,
dear sister, to say one word with reference to your work above. My poor soul
almost breaks forth with ecstasy while, for a moment, I allow my imagination to
carry me forward, to witness your employment when you shall have dropped this
clay tenement, and your disembodied spirit shall have soared away to breathe
the pure and holy atmosphere of heaven. There shall you be introduced into the
presence of your once suffering, now glorified Saviour. You shall see him as he
is. You shall be permitted to gaze on his uncreated beauties, and vie with the
angels in praising your Redeemer.<br>
<br>
But what is that I see just before you? It is a dark and lonely vale; but fear
it not, my sister. Come, let us walk together to the entrance of this dark
valley.<br>
<br>
Does your courage seem to fail you? Lean upon that tried arm: it will sustain
you. Are you disheartened at the ruggedness of the way? Cheer up your drooping
spirits: the way is short, and heavenly music shall attend your course, and
scatter all the gloom. And when heart and flesh shall fail you, when friends
can accompany you no farther, then angel-forms shall guide you, and, more
blessed than all else beside, Jesus the Saviour shall be with you, and lead you
by living fountains of waters.<br>
<br>
Allow me one word with regard to your encounter with the last enemy, Death.
Your victory and future triumph are secure. It is true that the enemy you will
encounter is haggard in his form; but be not afraid of him. His deadly power
has been taken from him; so that all he can do is but to cut the cord which
binds you here to earth, and free your captive soul, to be with Christ. Meet
him, then, dear sister, fearlessly. Meet him with a shout of victory; and, as
you enter on the contest, say triumphantly, "O Death! where is thy sting? O
grave! where is thy victory? Thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory,
through our Lord Jesus Christ."<br>
<br>
And should you for a moment seem to fall beneath his power, look away to Jesus,
and cry exultingly, "Rejoice not over me, O mine enemy! Though I fall, I shall
arise again!" and Jesus, yes, dear sister, Jesus, will surely bring you off
victorious. Oh, how that blessed thought lifts the soul above, and fits it for
its exit!<br>
<br>
I have written you, dear sister, as though I should never see you again till we
meet in heaven. Still the Lord may yet allow you the privilege of serving him
upon some heathen shore; and this may be to fit you for his work. God grant it
may be so! But, should it be otherwise, he may allow your spirit to go and
visit Burmah, and there witness the trophies of his grace; yes, and thence
again to ascend to heaven, carrying the blest intelligence that heathen souls
are coming home to God.<br>
<br>
Your affectionate brother,<br>
<br>
J. H. VINTON.</blockquote>
<p>She died a few days after the date of this letter. Her youngest sister,
Miranda, filled the place by her brother's side, which this sad death left
vacant, when in 1841 she joined the Maulmain Karen mission.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<pre>
"Must I be smitten, Lord?
    Are gentler measures vain?
Must I be smitten, Lord?
    Can nothing save but pain?

"Then the fierce tempest broke:
    I knew from whom it came;
I read in that sharp stroke
    A Father's hand and name."
</pre>
<p>During these years of preparation through which Justus Vinton was passing,
we find the young girl who was to be his future wife undergoing a peculiar
experience, and one which has rarely been equalled.</p>
<p>She had been unusually active and energetic as a child, but in her sixteenth
year she was prostrated by a severe and protracted illness.</p>
<p>For more than two years she was completely helpless, and unable to rise from
her bed. Her mind was filled with rebellious thoughts against God, who, she
sometimes felt, had created her only to suffer.</p>
<p>However, the Holy Spirit was pleased to make her affliction a means of
grace. She began to have juster views of her heavenly Father, and at last
submitted entirely to his will, acknowledging that it was better to suffer the
will of God than to be left to follow her own way. The duty of baptism
presented itself to her; though it seemed to be an impossible thing for her,
convinced as she was that it was only rightfully administered by immersion. Her
heart, however, was so determined, that her friends consented to her having an
interview with Elder Grow, who was then preaching at West Woodstock, four miles
from her home.</p>
<p>He has given, in his journal, the following account of the interview and her
subsequent baptism:--</p>
<p>"Calista Holman had been very sick, and to human appearance would never
recover. I was invited to visit her. She was brought in a chair into the room
where I was, as she was unable to walk, to relate her Christian experience.
Such an experience I never heard before nor since. Her mother asked me if it
would not injure her to be baptized. I answered, 'Just according to her faith.'
She herself believed it to be her duty, and requested me to baptize her. A
meeting was appointed at a house near the water; and after the sermon she was
wrapped in a buffalo-robe, and carried in a sleigh to the water-side (it was in
the month of March).</p>
<p>"I first baptized three of her sisters. I then asked her, 'Do you think you
could walk?' She answered, 'I think I can, a little.' Supported by Deacon
Seagrave on one side, and myself on the other, she entered the water, and was
baptized.</p>
<p>"She was then carried back to the house. One of the deacons said it was best
to give her the hand of fellowship at that time, for she would never be able to
meet with the church. When I stood by her bedside to give her the hand of
fellowship, I never enjoyed a season like it. It appeared to me that the whole
house was filled with the Holy Ghost."</p>
<p>The ordinance of the Lord's Supper was then administered at her earnest
request. She said she wished to remember her Lord's death once before she died.
During the administration Elder Grow said, "This is our sister's first
communion, and it will probably be her last. We now receive her into the church
militant: she will soon be with the church triumphant."</p>
<p>To her friends it seemed like a funeral service. To her it was <i>the
beginning of a new life</i>. She began to recover from that day; and the next
morning she arose from her bed without assistance, for the first time in more
than two years.</p>
<p>Her family physician, himself not a Baptist, cheerfully adds his testimony
to the fact of her recovery dating from her baptism. So far from being "about
to enter the church triumphant," she had thirty years of Christian warfare
before her. The frail girl of eighteen, whose baptism was looked upon as the
last important act of her life, was destined to cross the ocean, and for thirty
years to endure hardships and perform an amount of labor which would have
broken down an ordinary constitution.</p>
<p>The venerable widow of Deacon Seagrave, above mentioned, still survives, and
is living in Providence, R.I. She was present at the baptism; and, from her
vivid recollection of all the circumstances of that wonderful scene, we have
reproduced some of the details above given.</p>
<p>Calista Holman was no sooner restored to health, than she began to think
that her life was given her for a noble purpose. After much prayer and
self-examination, she resolved to devote herself to the work of foreign
missions. She was thrown upon her own resources for the completion of her
education, and that special training necessary to fit her for the work of her
life. By teaching and studying alternately, she obtained, however, an education
far in advance of that attained by most women of that day. She was particularly
proficient in the languages, obtaining such a knowledge of Latin, Greek, and
Hebrew, that, when married to Mr. Vinton, he found her far in advance of
himself in acquaintance with these tongues.</p>
<p>We do not know what his opinion was in regard to a wife knowing more than
her husband: but we find that he did not think it well for a man to know less
than his wife; for he at once commenced an extended course of private study, to
which he rigidly adhered for years in the midst of the most arduous missionary
labors.</p>
<p>On April 9, 1834, Mr. Vinton and Miss Holman were married. Miss Holman had
previously spent a year at Hamilton studying Karen in company with Mr. Vinton,
preparatory to their departure for Burmah.</p>
<p>Ko-chet-thaing (afterward Mr. Vinton's right-hand man in jungle-work and
preaching) had come to this country a short time previous with Rev. Mr. Wade.
He was their teacher in this new language. Mr. Vinton, in a letter to his
parents, gives an amusing account of the difficulties in their way.</p>
<p>"You will wish to know something of our studies. Well, then, we are studying
a language without a grammar or a dictionary. The Karens have never had a
written language until very recently, and even now all we can boast of is an
alphabet and a little tract of six pages. The courses we are obliged to pursue
in obtaining the Karen equivalents of English words are various.</p>
<p>"Sometimes we point to an object, and say in Karen 'n' koh de l&eacute;?'
'What do you call that?' and our teacher will give us the Karen word, which we
will insert in our dictionary. Often he brings us objects, and gives us their
names in Karen. To-day he brought us a grasshopper, and gave us its Karen name.
He then made it both hop and fly, so I was furnished with two more words. Then,
calling me out to see a hen and chickens, he gave me their names; and by
imitating the clucking of the hen, the crowing of the cock, and the peeping of
the chicks, he furnished us with Karen words signifying these several acts.</p>
<p>"When these methods fail we have recourse to brother Wade. We tell him the
words or phrases for which we wish the Karen, and he converses with
Ko-chet-thaing in Burmese; and through the medium of that language we obtain
what we want in Karen. So you see, we have a most difficult task before us.</p>
<p>"Our teacher, however, is most patient, and does all he can to help us to a
knowledge of the language. He tells us that we 'go much straighter' than we
did."</p>
<p>What a pity that this poor unlearned Karen teacher did not then, in 1833,
steal a march on Heness and Dr. Sauveur, and publish a treatise upon the
"natural method" of learning a language!</p>
<p>The result of this training was that Mr. Vinton acquired the Karen so
idiomatically, that in after-years he was an authority among the natives
themselves, for the use of Karen phrases; and they were accustomed to say, as
the highest praise, to later Karen missionaries, "You speak the language almost
as well as teacher Vinton."</p>
<p>In July, 1834, Mr. and Mrs. Vinton set sail in the good ship "Cashmere," for
Burmah, in company with the Wades, the Howards, the Deans, the Osgoods, and
others. They had a long voyage of one hundred and sixty days, and (a common
experience in those days) suffered much from shortness of provisions and lack
of water. To judge from most missionary journals of those days, American ships
were floating famine hulks. Most of the party suffered greatly from
sea-sickness; but Mr. Vinton was so prostrated that for six weeks he scarcely
left his berth, and his friends feared he would never live to reach Burmah.</p>
<p>Yet during this time of weakness and suffering, his mind dwelt continually
upon the impenitent condition of the officers and crew of the ship; and,
although unable to lift his head from the pillow, he spent hours in wrestling
with God in prayer for their salvation.</p>
<p>In a letter written during the voyage he says,--</p>
<blockquote>"When we first came on board 'The Cashmere,' I was unable to escape
the conviction that we had something to do for the salvation of souls before we
should reach Burmah. We had proceeded, however, but a little way, when I was
attacked by sea-sickness, and for nine weeks I was unable to preach. As I began
to get better, I felt such a burning solicitude for souls as I hardly ever
before experienced,--a solicitude which could find expression only in groans
and tears.<br>
<br>
"After preaching one day, when I was helped to pour forth the fulness of my
soul in fervent pleadings with the impenitent to come without delay to Christ,
I was much exhausted, as it was the first time I had attempted to stand so
long. I retired to rest, but could not. I had a load on my spirit which was
insupportable...When I could restrain the bursting emotions of my heart no
longer, I threw myself upon my face before God, and giving vent to a flood of
tears poured forth an agonizing cry for mercy upon their precious
souls."</blockquote>
<p>In one of the entries in his journal we find these words:--</p>
<blockquote>"The burden on my soul seems all but unbearable. I take it to
Jesus, and yet it weighs upon me till I feel crushed. This morning I looked at
the second officer with inexpressible longings that he should be a Christian. I
thought of his being a servant of the Devil, and of his having given to the
prince of hell that which belonged to God; and my cry was that God, for the
sake of his dear Son, would come and save his soul. In the afternoon I was so
oppressed, I knew not what to do. I went to my stateroom, and there besought
the Lord for Jesus' sake to send his Holy Spirit on board 'The
Cashmere.'"</blockquote>
<p>Nor was he alone in his longings. In Mrs. Vinton's journal we find the same
anxiety repeatedly expressed. She speaks of a remarkable scene, when Mr. Vinton
was preaching from the text, "Come, for all things are now ready;" during which
the sailors sat spell-bound, while he spoke of salvation, and of the sending of
the Holy Spirit to strive with sinners. A second sermon made those hardened men
tremble, and say that it seemed like the day of judgment.</p>
<p><i>That night</i> the first officer came to Mrs. Vinton, and told her he had
given his heart to God. The captain came out upon the Lord's side shortly
after, and from that time the Holy Spirit was present with continually
increasing power. The steward, the supercargo, and a number of the sailors were
converted.</p>
<p>The hearts of this faithful band of missionaries were made glad, not only by
seeing souls converted as the fruit of their labors and prayers, but also by
the earnestness with which the captain and officers joined in the meetings, and
plead with the unconverted to yield themselves to God.</p>
<p>Of one occasion Mrs. Vinton makes the following record in her journal:--</p>
<blockquote>"This evening the first officer rose, and in the fulness of his
heart addressed his shipmates. One of the sailors, unconscious of time or
place, or of any thing save the awful fact that he was a sinner hasting to the
judgment, arose at the same time, and <i>replied to every exhortation of the
officer</i>, saying, 'I <i>will</i> be for God; I will serve him; I will watch
and pray,' etc. Never before did I see a sinner so closely arraigned before his
own conscience and the bar of God, as he."</blockquote>
<p>In another entry, she says,--</p>
<blockquote>"At the meeting to-night the captain arose, and attempted to speak,
making a confession of his sins; but his heart was too full. After a few words,
he sat down, and gave vent to his tears. One of the sailors, to whom Mr. Vinton
had given a Bible, fell on his knees, and told the Lord that he had read in the
precious book which one of his servants had given him, the promise, 'Ask and ye
shall receive;' and, although he was conscious that he deserved nothing but
hell, yet he was encouraged by this promise to plead for forgiveness of his
sins. Such a strain of penitence and contrition for sin was then poured forth
as I never before heard."</blockquote>
<p>Truly "those who sow in tears shall reap in joy;" and the power of agonizing
and united prayer was never more plainly manifested than during that long and
uncomfortable voyage. Toward the latter portion of the voyage, both provisions
and water ran short; and so many of the crew were prostrated by scurvy, that
the ladies were obliged to do the stewards' work in the cabin, and the
missionaries had to assist in working the ship.</p>
<p>The parting between the missionaries and their spiritual children must have
been affecting beyond description. Yet, now that so many of that company are
gathered on the heavenly shore, how blessed must it be for them to recall those
hours spent in earnest prayer, and the precious ingathering of souls which
followed!</p>
<p>We doubt not also that Mr. Vinton rejoices as much as he expected to do,
that there is a land "where there is no more sea." His old enemy, sea-sickness,
never failed to meet him as soon as they lost sight of land, and they rarely
parted company until the anchor was down again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<pre>
"Toil on, faint not, keep watch and pray;
    Be wise the erring soul to win;
Go forth into the world's highway,
    Compel the wanderer to come in."
</pre>
<p>Mr. And Mrs. Vinton landed in Maulmain in December, 1834. By study at
Hamilton and during the voyage, they had become sufficiently familiar with the
language to admit of their beginning work at once. They left for the jungle
within a week of their arrival; and, entering a district where the gospel had
never been proclaimed, they continued for three months going about from village
to village preaching Christ to the multitudes.</p>
<p>At first they travelled together; but they received so many invitations from
distant villages, that they resolved to separate. Each took a band of native
Christians, and, with them as guides and assistants, went from village to
village preaching the wonderful story of the cross. This arrangement was found
so effective, that it became the plan for their future work. For twenty-four
years they carried out this idea of "dividing to conquer."</p>
<p>Mrs. Vinton would start in her little boat, accompanied by a few of her
school-girls, and spend the entire season in travelling from village to village
along the rivers, telling, in her own tender, womanly way, the story of
redemption to the crowds who gathered around her.</p>
<p>With this work of preaching the gospel was combined the ministering to the
sick, the manifold tender offices so necessary among a people without a single
correct idea concerning the human body and its ailments, and also the
inculcation of that most needful lesson that "cleanliness was next to
godliness."</p>
<p>She also established female prayer-meetings in every direction, and at the
most available points commenced village schools, placing them under the control
of some of her own scholars.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mr. Vinton would be pursuing the same plan of work among the
mountain-villages, and places more difficult of access. Occasionally their
paths would cross. In the depths of the jungle they would meet, travel together
for a little while, perhaps visiting some noted Karen prophet or prominent
opposer of the work; and then they would separate again, perhaps not to meet
until the labors of the season were over.</p>

<p><b>CHRISTIAN KAREN GIRLS.</b></p>
</center>
<p>It does not seem to have occurred to Mrs. Vinton to think that she was, in
the estimation of some wise theorists, "only a missionary's wife." She felt
that she had as truly a vocation to preach the gospel as had her husband. Yet,
withal, her work throughout her life was done with so much true womanliness and
modesty, that we think St. Paul himself would have been satisfied that she did
not "usurp authority over the man."</p>
<p>The long absences from each other were very trying in many ways; not only
because of the intense attachment which continued to exist during all their
married life,--an attachment which made their companionship an idyl,--but also
from the fact that jungle-travelling, in those days, was far more dangerous and
arduous than it is now. Tigers and other wild animals were very abundant, and
Mrs. Vinton repeatedly speaks of narrow escapes from them. Several times she
notes the fact that a tiger had come and taken cattle from under the open
native house in which she was sleeping, and when nothing but the protecting
hand of God prevented the ravenous beast from leaping upon the open veranda,
and taking one of the unconscious sleepers.</p>
<p>Jungle-work was not all a triumphal procession. In many places the Burmans
had so prejudiced the villagers by misrepresentations and frightful stories,
that the missionaries found it impossible to obtain food.</p>
<p>One story, widely circulated, was that the white missionaries stole children
to make slaves of them, or to eat them. Sometimes an entire village, on the
approach of the missionary, would flee into the jungle, tying the grass
together across the pathway, thus giving the missionary a significant warning
that if he followed them it was at the risk of his life.</p>
<p>The country was in an unsettled state; and bands of robbers roamed about,
attacking solitary boats and defenceless villages, carrying off the women and
children into slavery. This rendered travelling, without a strong escort,
unsafe. Mrs. Vinton writes, in a letter to Mrs. Baron Stow:--</p>
<blockquote>"I cannot have time to describe all the interesting scenes of the
past three months. We have been travelling constantly, and have been on a visit
to the great Karen prophet, about two hundred and fifty miles from
Maulmain."<br>
<br>
"The Karens in general listen with great interest when we tell them of God, and
frequently exclaim, 'That is what our forefathers told us! That is right! That
is good!' I have endeavored to discover how their forefathers came by a
knowledge of God; but they always answer, 'Our ancestors knew him from the
beginning, but when they sinned against him he hid himself from them; and their
descendants after them knew not how to worship him; and, as he did not protect
them from evil spirits, they were obliged to offer sacrifices to them to
appease their wrath.'<br>
<br>
"They tell us of many attempts 'to return to the worship of the God who made
the earth, and the heavens, and all things.'<br>
<br>
"These efforts have sometimes been continued for months, and even years; but
the poor Karens have invariably fallen a sacrifice to the brutal persecution of
the Burmans.<br>
<br>
"One village of nearly a thousand inhabitants worshipped God in this way for
some time, unknown to the Burmans; but, when the latter learned the fact, they
sent an armed force to destroy the village. Some of the Karens inquired of
their leader if they should fight. 'No,' replied the chief: 'it is inconsistent
with the worship of our God to fight. We will cast ourselves upon his
protection.' They then opened their gates, brought forth their weapons of
defence, and laid them at the feet of their enemies. Thus defenceless, they
were immediately slain by their cruel oppressors, the Burmans."</blockquote>

<p><b>KO-THA-BYU MEMORIAL HALL, BUILT AND PAID FOR BY THE KARENS.</b></p>
</center>

<p>This record seems incredible; and yet in the year 1851,--even so late a date
as that,--the Burmese viceroy of Rangoon told Mr. Kincaid that he would
instantly <i>shoot the first Karen whom he found that could read.</i></p>
<p>The eagerness which the scattered communities of Karens manifested to hear
of the "long-lost law of their God" was most gratifying; but it made the hearts
of the lonely laborers ache to see how little they could accomplish among so
many. Wherever they went, they were urged beyond measure to go to other
villages, and tell the "good news" there; and so deeply did the magnitude of
their labors press upon them, that Mrs. Vinton writes:--</p>
<blockquote>"Oh, could we be divided, and go a thousand ways at once, then
might the poor Karens hear the gospel. When I reflect upon the earnestness of
this dear people to receive the gospel, while so few can hear it from our lips,
my heart sinks within me.<br>
<br>
"A large party of Karens have just been here; and when they were told that Mr.
Vinton had gone by land to Newville, and that I had gone down the river, they
said they feared they would never see us. They told Ko-chet-thaing that they
had heard that God had shown mercy to the Karens, and had sent them his word
and teachers; and they had long been inquiring where we were. Sometimes they
would hear of us at Maulmain, sometimes at Belu-Gyun, sometimes at Chummerah,
sometimes at La Kee's village; but they never could find us. Their 'younger
brother, the white man,' had come, and had brought the long-lost law of their
God; but to them it was all in vain. They remained in their sins, poverty, and
wretchedness, and should go down to hell if the teachers did not pity them.
They begged Ko-chet-thaing to intercede with us, that we would remain in one
place, that they might all come to us.<br>
<br>
"Ko-chet-thaing was much moved as he told me the sad tale; and I could not
refrain from tears. A chief on the Burman border is praying morning and evening
that God will send the teachers that way, that he may be baptized. Lord, what
are we among so many? Send, oh! send more laborers into this
harvest!"</blockquote>
<p>In an account of a journey taken shortly after, she writes:--</p>
<blockquote>"We had scarcely set our feet upon the shore, before an
intelligent-looking woman asked me where we were going. I told her I was going
to a village eight miles inland, to tell the people there about God. She
inquired why we did not tell the villagers present about God.<br>
<br>
"I told her I could not stop then, as I had appointed to be at the inland
village, and must reach there before the heat became too great. Her countenance
fell, but she immediately passed on before us. And, when we had proceeded about
a mile, we reached a village, and found all the inhabitants standing in the
road to receive us. As we drew near, they cried out to us, 'Tell <i>us</i> of
the law of God! Tell <i>us</i> of the law of God!'<br>
<br>
"Such was their entreaty, that we were compelled to stop about half an hour,
and preach to them, promising that we would come back to them at some future
time. At the next village the people gathered around me with intense interest
to inquire about the new religion. After talking to them some time, I spoke of
prayer. With great earnestness, they asked, 'How shall we pray?' I called on
one of the assistants to pray; and, as he commenced, the head man followed,
repeating word for word. They plead with great earnestness that we would remain
with them during the night, that they might call in the inhabitants of the
surrounding villages, that they, too, might hear of God and heaven...<br>
<br>
"Two miles farther on, we came to a Pwo Karen village. We went at once to the
house of the chief; but his wife, who had never before seen a white person,
would not permit us to enter. As soon, however, as the villagers learned who we
were, they flocked around us, and listened attentively to the word of God. The
assistants were so moved by their pressing invitations to remain, that they
began to plead with me to remain over sabbath. In vain I told them of our many
engagements, of the much we had to do before the rains.<br>
<br>
"It was not until I told them that I thought Mr. Vinton would travel there
during the rains, that I could persuade them to proceed. That evening we
visited another village, and spent the night at the house of the chief.<br>
<br>
"We had a large and deeply-interested audience; and although I closed the
service at nine o'clock, yet the assistants continued preaching till after
midnight, and began again before light.<br>
<br>
"Although we had to return to the boat that day, and much of our way lay
through burnt-over forests, yet it was impossible to force ourselves away from
the people before the sun had become quite hot. On our return we met several
companies of people, who showed such an anxiety to hear the word, that, when
the assistants were once seated, they seemed chained to the spot.<br>
<br>
"On reaching the boat, I found that one of the two men I had left to watch it
had gone off to a distant village, preaching. It appeared, that, the night
previous, several men had listened to the gospel, and they would not be content
until their friends should hear it also. So they over-persuaded this man to
return with them, and spend two or three days. We proceeded up the river some
distance, and found him there preaching to the villagers. A number said that
they believed in this religion, and would worship God.<br>
<br>
"I was feeling so exhausted from over-exertion, that I felt it was necessary to
return as soon as I conveniently could to Ko-chet-thaing's village, not only
for rest, but for necessary medicine. I had also in the boat a sick Karen
woman, who needed attention and medicine at once. However, we felt compelled to
stop at another village, where the people had been having a great
'<i>&gt;nat</i> feast' (a feast in honor of the evil spirits, whom the Karens
believe to be the cause of sickness, misfortune, etc., if angry; and of good
fortune, if appeased).<br>
<br>
"Hearing of my arrival, they gathered around me; and although I could scarcely
stand, or even sit erect, yet I contrived to talk to them; and they listened
during the whole day, each one assuring me that they would never again eat to
the <i>nats</i>, but, as they had now heard of God, they would with one consent
worship him. Not only so; but they would return to their respective villages,
and tell their friends what they had heard, and persuade them to worship him
too."</blockquote>
<p>What would our pastors at home in America give to have the message they
bring welcomed so thankfully, and embraced so readily! What would they give to
know that every one of their converts became at once a preacher of
righteousness, and carried the good news of salvation to some other waiting
soul!</p>
<p>The work of preaching the gospel among the Karens was not, however, unmixed
with discouragements. Mrs. Vinton in her journal speaks of some villages where
the people refused to receive her, and where even the women retreated to the
houses, and pulled up the ladders after them (a ladder or a notched stick being
the usual mode of entrance to a heathen Karen house). One such scene she thus
describes in her characteristic way:--</p>
<blockquote>"We have just stopped at a Pwo Karen village where, for days past,
multitudes have assembled to worship the pagoda." [Many Pwos and some Sgaus,
the two main septs of Karens, had embraced Buddhism, at least nominally, before
the arrival of missionaries.]<br>
<br>
"The assembly was just breaking up. It was impossible to get even a hearing,
for every one was busy about his own matters; and, besides, they did not like
to hear, that, instead of getting merit, they had been sinning against God, and
if unrepentant they would be lost. I went up to the village, thinking perhaps
they would listen at their homes; but, seeing me coming, they pulled up their
ladders, and set their dogs on me. On returning to the boat, I could not help
inquiring if one of that vast number <i>could</i> be saved. They are far more
hopeless than were Ezekiel's dry bones: for they would lie passive when
prophesied over; but these, as if the Devil did not like to be attacked upon
his own ground, were ready to burst with rage at us for trying to tell them 'a
more excellent way."<br>
<br>
"Last night we were at a village where we found a widow whose husband was
killed a few weeks ago in a trap set for wild beasts. Mr. Vinton and I had
repeatedly urged him to accept of Christ; but he invariably told us that he was
convinced of the propriety of worshipping God, and he even exhorted others to
repentance; but, as for himself, he could not yet leave off drink. Only a few
days before his death, Mr. Vinton, with his usual earnestness, urged him to
accept of Christ immediately, reminding him of the uncertainty of life. He said
he would repent by and by. A few days after, being urged by some of his
relatives to go to a <i>nat</i> feast, he went, and was killed on the way.
Those who set the trap offered the bereaved widow the price of her husband
(about two hundred dollars according to Karen law); but she refused, and,
strange to say, <i>asks another husband in his stead.</i><br>
<br>
"The people in this region are in a very excited state on account of the
depredations of robbers.<br>
<br>
"A buffalo came running into the village to-day with a spear six feet long
sticking in his back. A band of about two hundred robbers from the Shan country
have been lurking about the villages for several days past, in order to steal
children, and sell them for slaves. They have obtained several little ones
already, and the villagers are in great consternation about it.<br>
<br>
"Oh, my sister! you do not know how to appreciate your peaceful home. You do
not know what it is to go to bed at night knowing that robbers are lurking
around your dwelling, or that tigers are smelling your footsteps around the
house, and waiting for their prey. They have become so bold at Newville that
they will go up a ladder ten feet high, seize a man in the house, and carry him
off. When I think of the ten thousand dangers to which we are exposed, I wonder
that we are still alive."</blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<pre>
"Go, labor on, spend and be spent,--
    Thy joy to do the Father's will:
It is the way the Master went;
    Should not the servant tread it still?"
</pre>
<p>Mr. Vinton was a man of strong faith and of remarkable power in prayer. We
never heard the term so commonly used now, "gifted in prayer," applied to him;
but his petitions were wrestlings with God, and were characterized by all the
urgency and earnestness with which a man might plead for his life or that of
his dearest friend. A minister, speaking of an occasion when he heard Elder
Swan and Mr. Vinton praying together, says, "I never heard any thing like it.
They seemed utterly unconscious of time or place. They appeared to be standing
face to face with God; and they pleaded with him for lost souls in such a way
that I felt convinced that that was <i>prevailing prayer.</i>"</p>
<p>Much of the success which attended the labors of these two eminent men of
God was doubtless owing to their strong faith that God heard and answered
prayer, and to a certain persistence with which they carried out their
convictions of duty. Some men called it obstinacy; but many redeemed souls
to-day are praising God for that very obstinacy, for the persistence with which
they labored and prayed, the one among the heathen in Burmah, the other among
the gospel-hardened sinners of our own New England.</p>
<p>Which was the more difficult field, we will not now undertake to say; but
what a glorious meeting it will be when these two life-long friends clasp hands
on the other shore, and together recount the wonders of redemption, and recall
the many hard-fought battles here on earth, and greet the thousands among the
redeemed who were led by their words and prayers to Jesus!</p>
<p>As illustrative of Mr. Vinton's determination when he believed himself to be
in the way of duty, we give a brief account of his visit to a noted Karen
prophet, as taken from his journal:--</p>
<blockquote>"We are now at the prophet's village, but have not yet seen him. On
our arrival yesterday, his followers told us he was absent, but would be back
at night. Night came, but he was still absent, and continues to be so, if the
word of the villagers can be relied upon; but, unfortunately, no two
individuals agree in their statements about him. It is probable that he will
prevent an interview if possible. He has so far committed himself, that to meet
me would be to his disadvantage; for he has asserted that I am his older
brother, <i>Jesus Christ</i>, and that there is no difference between his
sentiments and mine.<br>
<br>
"The villagers appear well: they listen attentively, and acknowledge that it is
wrong to worship pagodas, and hold <i>nat</i> feasts; and many say they will
come and worship with us to-morrow."</blockquote>
<p>The next day the people did not seem so willing to listen. None came to
worship; but, on visiting some of the principal men at their homes, they
professed to believe the truths of religion, but said they dared not profess it
publicly, because, if they did, the Burmans would kill them. They proposed to
worship God in secret, and, when questioned, to say that they believed as the
Burmans did; but, when told that if they became Jesus Christ's followers they
must give up lying and deceiving, they said, "Well, then, we cannot be his
disciples." They began to inquire when Mr. Vinton was going to leave; and the
answer was, "Not till I have seen your prophet, if I have to stay here two
months."</p>
<p>Several days passed, and still the prophet remained absent. All the
favorable indications disappeared, and the villagers seemed to have determined
that they would have nothing to do with the new religion if they must come out
and own Christ before the world. An excursion to some of the neighboring
villages, however, resulted in the conversion of a chief and another man, who
frequently visited Mr. Vinton at his boat. They were so eager for instruction
that they sometimes remained far into the night, talking about God. They said,
"We will worship God. If the Burmans persecute us in one place, we will fly to
another. If seized and tortured, we will sooner die than deny the Saviour."</p>
<p>Yet still the prophet's followers continued to oppose so strongly, and they
showed such an evident desire to get rid of the whole party, that Mr. Vinton's
assistants began to urge him to return to Maulmain without seeing the
prophet.</p>
<p>To this, however, Mr. Vinton would not listen for a moment. He proposed,
instead, a day of fasting and prayer, that God would pour out his Spirit upon
the opposers of his truth, and turn their hearts unto himself. To this the
assistants cheerfully consented; and he says in his journal,--</p>
<blockquote>"We are spending to-day in looking up to God for his blessing.
Shall we look in vain? My heart dies within me at the thought. O Thou who hast
never said to the seed of Jacob, 'Seek ye me in vain,' art thou not even now
inviting us to seek the Lord till he come and rain righteousness upon
us?"</blockquote>
<p>The next day the indications still appeared unfavorable. Mr. Vinton
writes:--</p>
<blockquote>"The assistants, to a man, are disheartened, and wish to return. I
told them to-day I could not go yet, but they might if they wished. They held a
consultation, and all except two resolved to go.* We went up to the village as
usual to talk to the people, for no one will come to us; but we could not
obtain a hearing from a single person. If we went into their houses, the people
would vacate them, and leave us alone.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: * One of these was Ko-chet-thaing, the first Karen Mr. Vinton ever
saw, and from whom he learned the language.]<br>
<br>
"If we visited them at their work, they would either leave it, or remain silent
as dumb men. After sunset the gongs and drums began to beat; and the cry was
raised, 'Away! away to the pagoda to worship!' We went back to the boat; but
soon a messenger came, saying that the prophet had returned, and would meet us
at the pagoda.<br>
<br>
"When introduced to him, his whole manner indicated, what I had previously
suspected, that he was afraid of me. I attacked him on all sides, but he was
very evasive. He consented to all that I urged, save to give up his heathen
practices, and, with his followers, to become openly the servant of the living
God. To this he said he did not dare do so, for the Burmans would in that case
put them all to death. He is a cunning, artful fellow, and has undoubtedly
consented to see me, merely to get rid of us. When I told him it was the
command of Christ to preach the gospel to every creature, he adroitly replied,
'The people here have heard. Now go and preach to those who have not
heard.'<br>
<br>
"Our interview closed with the most pressing invitation to leave the
place."</blockquote>
<p>One would think that by this time Mr. Vinton had done all that any one
could, and that he would have shaken the dust of that village from off his
feet, and gone his way; especially as the assistants came, and told him that
the rice was exhausted, and not a kernel could be purchased in the prophet's
village. But to their urgent entreaties Mr. Vinton answered, "If we return now,
nothing will be effected; and God has not brought us here for nothing."</p>
<p>After a season of prayer, the assistants consented to remain one day
longer.</p>
<p>And now mark the providence of God. Not only was Mr. Vinton's presence
secretly undermining the prophet's influence, as will appear in the close of
this narrative, but in the villages in the immediate neighborhood of the
prophet's home the Spirit of God was preparing a work, the magnitude of which
at the time was not even suspected.</p>
<p>We have mentioned on page 42 the conversion of a chief and one follower. In
the afternoon of the "one day longer" he came to Mr. Vinton, bringing three
others with him, to hear more of the new religion. Mr. Vinton went with them
across the plain, the little distance which separated the boat from their
village, and they called all the inhabitants together.</p>
<p>During the rest of the afternoon and evening they listened to the preaching
of the word; and the entire company resolved at once to embrace the truth, and
serve Christ.</p>
<p>The chief said, "There are villages all around us in the mountains, which
have never heard the word of God. And now will you not go on, and tell them the
'good news,' so that they, too, may believe and be saved?"</p>
<p>Mr. Vinton had not come prepared to stay over night, having brought no
bedding, and having even left his coat in the boat. The nights at that season
in the year were as chilly, among the mountains, as they are here in October.
However, the people pressed him so earnestly to remain with them that night,
and go to the other villages on the morrow, that he consented. Let us give the
account of the night in his own words:--</p>
<blockquote>"I am here without shelter; still I am comfortably provided for.
The Karens have built a rousing fire, which they will keep burning all night,
by the side of which I shall in a few moments lay me down upon a fine new mat,
and cover me with a piece of new cloth direct from the loom. The inquiry was
made a moment ago, 'Has the teacher a pillow?'<br>
<br>
"On finding me destitute, I was presented with a nice <i>bamboo</i> (six or
seven inches in diameter), which, but for the quality of hardness, would answer
as good a purpose as I could desire. Still I hope to enjoy a comfortable
night's rest."</blockquote>
<p>The night, however, was not to pass without interruption. At midnight the
chief and a number of villagers came over to the place where they were
sleeping, and woke them up, desiring to be told more about God and heaven. They
preached to them for two hours, and then they left the tired missionary for a
while. Before light, however, the chief came back, and staid with them till
they left. So much eagerness was shown to hear the gospel, that Mr. Vinton
promised to send a young man to become their teacher. They, on their part,
agreed to build a chapel, and take all the care possible of the teacher who
should be sent.</p>
<p>Urged by the chief, Mr. Vinton consented to visit some of the neighboring
villages. At the very next village, the head-man and all the principal men
said, "This is the long-lost law of our God. This is the true religion. We will
embrace it; and, if the teacher is willing, we will be baptized on the spot."
Three powerful chiefs in the same region promised to build, each of them, a
chapel, and support a teacher if Mr. Vinton would send one.</p>
<p>Wherever he went, crowds followed, eager to hear the truth; and hundreds
were converted. Mr. Vinton says,--</p>
<blockquote>"We have been brought in safety to this village. We had a most
fatiguing time, sometimes for hours being obliged to drag ourselves up the
steep ascent by laying hold of the bamboos which grew beside our path. We were
much exhausted on our arrival; but the villagers came together at once, and
after listening to us for a few hours they said, 'We will believe in Jesus, and
embrace him as our Saviour.' They then entered into the most minute inquiries
to learn how they, as the disciples of Christ, should conduct themselves. These
inquiries continued until a late hour. They desired particularly to know how
they should spend the Lord's Day, and how they should pray.<br>
<br>
"When the old men returned to the village, the young men remained to sleep with
us in the zayat. I could not sleep. My thoughts of God and heaven were too
sweet to admit of interruption. The zayat had no roof; so I lay and gazed upon
the stars, and thought of the wonderful majesty of God, and the more wonderful
grace which could stoop to save rebellious man. The more I mused upon it, the
more was I lost in contemplation of the amazing theme. I could only repeat,
'God <i>so</i> loved the world;' but why, and how much, I could not tell. A
little before light these sweet thoughts were interrupted. The Karens had
awakened from their slumber; and each began saying to his companion, 'Pray to
God;' when the other would respond 'Pray;' and then was heard, in every part of
the zayat, the voice of prayer from those who were making their first petitions
to the living God."</blockquote>
<p>But it is time to speak of the effect of Mr. Vinton's stay at the prophet's
village, and of this evangelistic work in the vicinity. It was soon seen that
the prophet's influence was being sensibly weakened. When Mr. Vinton was on his
return, he appointed a meeting at the foot of the mountain, within sight of the
prophet's village. Hither came great numbers, many of whom were the converts of
the night preaching of that "one day longer" to which the assistants consented.
They had remained faithful; and their resolutions to serve God had gained
strength, although they were bitterly opposed by the prophet and his adherents.
The day was spent in the most interesting religious services, Ko-chet-thaing
being one of the preachers.</p>

<p><b>BAMBOO.</b></p>
</center>
<p>At the close of the day the chief said, "Well, the prophet has proved
himself a false prophet for once; for this morning he told us that last night
his <i>Kala</i> [spirit] had gone and visited the white teacher, and that he
[the teacher] had gone to Maulmain."</p>
<p>Said Mr. Vinton, "As to his spirit visiting me, I know nothing about it. As
to my going to Maulmain, you can judge as well as I." At this instant one of
the prophet's principal adherents came up, when the chief attacked him, to know
what he thought of such a leader as the prophet.</p>
<p>"If," said the chief, "he did not know, why did he say such a thing? If he
did know, why did he lie so?" The poor man had not one word to offer in
vindication of the prophet, and the effect upon the by-standers was great.</p>
<p>Mr. Vinton's journal continues:--</p>
<blockquote>"On reaching the boat, I found a noted chief from Siam awaiting me.
There was more of princely dignity and style about his person and attendants
than I ever saw before in a Karen; but he listened with great interest to the
story of the cross; and when I ceased speaking said, 'I have never heard any
thing about this religion before. Now, will you not come to my country, and
spend a long time, and teach me and the thousands of my people, so that we may
be saved?'<br>
<br>
"I answered with a full heart, 'Yes! if my life is spared, I will come.' I
promised to send them a native teacher; and the chief, on his part, promised to
support him."</blockquote>
<p>From this interesting interview, Mr. Vinton left the prophet's village, and
went to the central village of the territory, occupied by the celebrated
<i>Lakee</i>, one of the most powerful chiefs among the Karens, and a most
interesting character.</p>
<p>Mr. Vinton says of him,--</p>
<blockquote>"He is the leading character among the Karens, and the only one who
is much respected by the Burmans. His influence is daily extending, and he bids
fair to be a kind of prince among them.<br>
<br>
"He is a man of more mind than any Karen I have yet seen; boasts no royal
ancestry, but has risen to his present eminence upon his own merits. The Karens
from all parts of Burmah are flocking into this region to put themselves under
his jurisdiction; so that this may yet be the very heart of the Karen world,
and Lakee become a king.<br>
<br>
"When I inquired of him what he thought of the Christian religion, he answered,
'Your account of it is very good; but I have never seen any of the foreign
teachers before, and do not, therefore, know what credit to give your
statements. The prophet and other teachers have their pretended revelations
from God; but we have to take their word for it, for no one can read or
understand the revelation but themselves.'<br>
<br>
"I then proposed to send him a man who should teach his people to read the word
of God for themselves. 'Yes, yes!' said he, interrupting me. 'That is it! Now
the teacher's words hit my heart. Just send me a man that shall teach the
people to read; and, if what you say about the law of God is true, we will
embrace this religion at once, and all be baptized together.'<br>
<br>
"Had this expedition accomplished nothing but the arrangement for placing these
native assistants, I should feel that our labor had not been in vain in the
Lord; but hundreds have for the first time listened to the preaching of the
gospel, and the seed has been sown, which, with God's blessing, will produce an
abundant harvest."</blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<pre>
"Not many lives, but only one, have we;
    One, only one:
How sacred should that one life ever be,
    That narrow span!
Day after day filled up with blessed toil,
Hour after hour still bringing in new spoil."
</pre>
<p>We have given, already, enough to indicate the untiring devotion and the
marvellous skill, which characterized Mr. Vinton's labors among the Karens.</p>
<p>His labors, however, were not confined to this people. He studied the
Burmese language, so that he might be able to preach to the Burmans when
opportunity offered. When confined to the city during the rains, when
travelling is impossible, we find him laboring among the English soldiers in
garrison, preaching and distributing tracts among the Burmese, and pushing on
the Karen translation of the New Testament, or writing his Commentary.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vinton speaks, in a letter home, of his having distributed over EIGHT
THOUSAND TRACTS in six weeks; and his faithful labors among the troops resulted
in many conversions, not only among the common soldiery, but among their
officers as well.</p>

<p><b>PAGODA AT MAULMAIN.</b></p>
</center>
<p>His deep piety, and absolute devotion to the work of saving souls of
whatever nationality, won for him during his life the respect and admiration of
all with whom he came in contact; even of men who honored the man and
missionary, though they hated his religion. Many such contributed material aid,
and afforded him assistance by kindly acts which could not be purchased with
gold.</p>
<p>One, a professed atheist, was a ship-owner. He often said to him, "Mr.
Vinton, I don't believe as you do, and it is no use for you to try and make a
Christian of me; but remember, you and your family are welcome to a free
passage on any of my ships at any time, and to any port; and my house, either
in Rangoon, or Maulmain, or Amherst, is always open to you."</p>
<p>These were no empty professions. On several occasions it was necessary for
both Mr. and Mrs. Vinton to avail themselves of his generosity; and they found
that his captains had received orders to show them every courtesy, and to place
the best of every thing on board at their disposal.</p>
<p>Mr. Vinton's genial, sunny disposition endeared him alike to the ignorant,
simple-minded Karens, and to the cultivated and sometimes fastidious English
officers, who had it in their power to aid him so greatly in his work.</p>
<p>Credit has never been sufficiently given here, in America, to the assistance
which English residents have furnished to our missions and missionaries. Much
of our success, particularly in Burmah, has been due to the moral as well as
pecuniary support extended to the missionaries by English civil and military
officers.</p>
<p>Even the English government offers to any mission school what is called a
"grant-in-aid." This is a sum of money equal to the amount expended by the
school itself for educational purposes. The sums thus paid vary from two
hundred and fifty dollars to fifteen hundred dollars in different schools. No
restrictions are placed upon the schools receiving such aid, save that they
shall be open to the government director of education for inspection.</p>
<p>Mr. P. Hordern, who has been for the past ten years government director in
Burmah, is an enthusiastic admirer of the American school system, and has given
great encouragement to educational work in all our stations.</p>
<p>Thousands of dollars are also given by private individuals. These donations
are sent to the missionary in the most quiet, unostentatious manner, generally
with a request that the name of the donor may not be mentioned. Grants of land
for building purposes, exemption from taxation, free medical attendance, and
even a military or police guard in passing through dangerous parts of the
country--these, and a hundred other kindly acts which an English officer has it
in his power to perform, make his friendship a desirable thing, however much
some may affect to despise it.</p>
<p>No one ever had more opportunity of testing this than Mr. Vinton; though Dr.
Kincaid, Mrs. Ingalls, Dr. Binney, Dr. Mason, and others have cheerfully borne
testimony to the large-hearted liberality, the hearty co-operation, the tender
sympathy, and the unexpected help in time of sickness or trial, which many of
the English government officers have given.</p>
<p>We have referred to the material aid given. We may not omit speaking of the
earnest Christian life of many of these officers. Havelock was not a phenomenal
character. Hundreds of English officers in India have been equally devoted and
faithful. They are found to-day in every station, from the lowest to the
highest. When in 1853 Lord Dalhousie, the governor-general, came to Rangoon, he
was quite ill, yet he said to one of his suite, "If I am able to see any one,
it must be the American missionaries." They were accordingly sent for, to have
a personal interview with him. He made many inquiries about the mission, and
expressed a deep interest in the work among the Karens. When Mr. Vinton and Dr.
Kincaid thanked him for the kindness which had been shown them by his
subordinate officers, he said quietly, "I am glad if they have done their
<i>duty</i>."</p>
<p>Let any one read that exquisite work, "Twelve Years of a Soldier's Life in
India," the record of one of the most daring soldiers that ever was known in
that land of daring men; the man who, with seventy-five native troopers, took
the princes of Delhi from the midst of an armed mob of thousands of
natives.</p>
<p>Yet this man was one of the most humble Christians in the army.</p>
<p>The 39th Regiment was known familiarly as "God Almighty's Own," from the
large number of pious men in it.</p>
<p>The roll of Christian officers includes some of the most distinguished names
in the history of the English dominion in India.</p>
<p>Sir Henry Lawrence; Sir Henry Havelock; Sir Herbert Edwards, famous in the
Punjaub; Gen. John Nicholson; Gen. Neill, bravest of the brave; Hodson, the
captor of the Delhi princes; D'Arcy Todd, killed at the head of his men at
Ferozeshahar, and whose last entry in his journal was that he only wished to
live that the love of Christ might prepare him to leave this world; Arthur
Conolly, lovely and beloved, who fell a martyr at Bokhara; Gen. James Bell,
whose tender offices of kindness have so often comforted the hearts of our
missionaries in Burmah; Gen. Sir David Russell, who last year gave sixteen
thousand rupees to the Rangoon mission,--these are a few only of the many names
of the Lord's dear children who have in former years been the most faithful
supporters of missions in India.</p>
<p>Their places are vacant now. Many hearts in India have been saddened as
death has called them, or as the burden of years of arduous service has sent
them home to England; but in their stead others are arising; and some of the
brightest spots in a missionary's life are illumined by the light of that
Christian love which has been shown by these devoted servants of God.</p>
<p>We have spoken of Mr. Vinton's sunny disposition. It was a family trait; and
Mrs. Vinton, herself naturally inclined to despondency, was accustomed to say,
"A Vinton never can see trouble ahead." She would sometimes illustrate this
persistent determination to look on the bright side, by describing a scene,
which, no doubt, had more than once occurred.</p>
<p>"Mr. Vinton and Miranda, his sister, would plan an expedition on horseback.
I would say, 'Why, it is no use sending for the ponies: it is just going to
rain.'</p>
<p>"'Oh, no!' Miranda would say: 'look at that blue sky,' pointing to a little
break in the clouds, away in precisely the opposite direction from that from
which the storm was approaching. I would lead her around to the other side of
the house, and show her the heavy black clouds coming up from the south-west,
boding a perfect downfall. 'Yes, yes!' she would say: 'that looks like rain by
and by, but there is time enough for us to get our ride before the storm.
Besides, it may all blow over. What do you think, brother?'--'Oh, yes! we'll
go, by all means. It doesn't look near so black as it did. Put on your habit,
and we'll be off and home again before it rains.' Before the riding-habit could
be donned, the wind would be blowing a hurricane, and the rain coming down in
torrents; but those two would appear as unconcerned as if it were all a part of
their plan. If I said, 'You see I was right about the rain,' Mr. Vinton would
answer, 'Yes, my dear, you are always right; but wait a moment. This storm will
be over soon, and then our ride will be all the more pleasant for the rain.'
Yet I could see that it had set in for a heavy pour which would last all night.
The only satisfaction I ever received was, 'Well, Miranda, it will be all the
brighter to-morrow, and we will take a longer ride then.'"</p>
<p>This scene may seem, to those who did not know Mr. Vinton, somewhat
exaggerated; but it is not overdrawn in the slightest. Indeed, it might almost
be a parable of the man's life. The "rainy days" which came into his life have
only made the morrow of eternity the brighter.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vinton found this hopefulness and buoyancy of disposition in her
husband a great source of strength in her many hours of despondency and
discouragement. Many times did she go to her husband's study utterly
dispirited, seeing nothing but difficulty and possible failure in the future;
but in the sunshine of his happy spirit all the clouds were driven away, and
she went back to her work feeling that after all, there was something yet worth
living for.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when worn out with her unceasing labors, and suffering from the
depressing effects of the climate, she would imagine that that curse of India,
<i>disease of the liver</i>, had made her its victim; and after putting the
clothing of the household in order, and generally settling affairs, she would
go to her husband to "talk it over" with him, and arrange for the future in the
event of her death. He, however, would laughingly say, "My dear, it is not your
liver that is affected: it is your <i>brain</i>. Depend upon it, the trouble is
there."</p>
<p>This may sound heartless; but no one who knew the great tenderness of his
heart could for one moment believe him capable of want of sympathy. Mrs. Vinton
has said that it was the truest kindness to turn her thoughts away from her own
feelings; and she would come out of his study laughing, and saying, "Well, it
is scarcely worth while to arrange for my funeral just yet."</p>
<p>When she would go to him in tears over some act of unkindness or
ingratitude, his only reply was, "Be above it, my dear; be above it! If you
take any notice of it whatever, you only lower yourself to a level with those
who have injured you. Be above it!"</p>
<p>Thus, amid encouragement and discouragement, his sunny cheerfulness and
faith in God supported him amid labors and trials which would have broken down
a less buoyant constitution. He obeyed literally the injunction, "Rejoice in
the Lord always, and again I say, Rejoice."</p>

<p><b>KAREN MISSION COMPOUND AT MAULMAIN.</b></p>
</center>
<p>During the period between 1834 and 1848, Mr. Vinton's labors were confined
to the Maulmain district, with the exception of occasional journeys into
Rangoon and Tavoy.</p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of these personal memoirs to give a detail of these
labors. The results may be found briefly summed up in the records of the
mission, and in the statistics of the Maulmain Karen mission for 1847.</p>
<p>In September, 1841, the sister Miranda, already alluded to, joined her
brother on the mission field. She was then only twenty-two years of age. For
seven years she had hoped and prayed that God would send her to Burmah; and it
was "the happiest day of her life" when she found herself by her brother's side
in Maulmain. She at once engaged in the work of teaching, for which she showed
marked talent.</p>
<p>She acquired the language from constant communion with the natives, and
continued to use it throughout her life with marked fluency and correctness of
idiom. The exceeding sweetness of her disposition endeared her to all. Indeed,
she was one of the few in this world who are so blessed as to avoid all carping
criticism, and to escape the sting of venomous tongues.</p>
<p>To both Mr. and Mrs. Vinton, her presence, as well as the assistance she
rendered, was an unspeakable comfort and joy. During the next twelve years of
varied experience, of patient seed-sowing and triumphant harvesting, "Sister
Miranda," as the whole mission called her, was the light and joy of the house,
a constant benediction from on high.</p>
<p>Of her life and labors we will let those speak who knew her well, and loved
her dearly. Mrs. Dr. Binney and Mrs. Dr. Stevens have kindly furnished
reminiscences which will be found at the close of this volume.</p>
<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Vinton three children had been born,--Justus Brainerd in
April, 1840; Calista in September, 1841; and Harvey Howard in 1846. In 1847
Mrs. Vinton's health failed completely, and it was thought best for her to
return to America. The necessity of rest for Mr. Vinton was also apparent; and,
besides, it was deemed advisable to have him return in order to try to awaken
anew the missionary spirit and consecration of our churches.</p>
<p>They set sail in "The Ocean Queen," from Maulmain for the Cape, in the
latter part of 1847. The voyage to the Cape of Good Hope was perilous; and in
Table Bay the ship was saved from going ashore on Robin Island only when every
cable had parted save one.</p>
<p>At Cape Town the Vintons remained for several months, waiting for a vessel
in which they could obtain passage to America. Here Harvey, the youngest child,
sickened and died; and the afflicted parents made his grave in that strange
land.</p>
<p>They obtained passage finally in the ship "William Shaler," and landed in
Boston early in 1848, after fourteen years' absence from home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<pre>
    "Such let my life be here,
Not marked by noise, but by success alone;
Not known by bustle, but by useful deeds;
Quiet and gentle, clear and fair as light,
Yet full of its all-penetrating power,
Its silent but resistless influence;
Making no needless sound, yet ever working,
Hour after hour, upon a needy world!"
</pre>
<p>The missionary spirit of the American Baptist churches in 1848 was at a low
ebb. The first enthusiasm of the mission effort had passed away. Dr. Judson's
return in 1844 had revived old memories, and to some extent increased the
contributions; yet in 1846 the income of the Missionary Union was so small,
that the Board were forced to debate as to <i>which of their missions they
would relinquish</i>. The society was forty thousand dollars in debt, and the
deficit was increasing yearly.</p>
<p>It was necessary, therefore, that Mr. Vinton should spend most of his time
in visiting the churches, and striving to persuade their members to do from
enthusiasm what they should have done from motives of duty.</p>
<p>He was accompanied in these journeys by two young Karens, Myah A and Kone
Lowk, whom he had brought with him to this country to assist him in translating
the Bible into Karen.</p>
<p>Mr. Vinton's own enthusiasm was contagious. His fine presence, remarkable
ability as a public speaker, and his sweet singing, all contributed to deepen
the impression which his earnest words had produced. His singing of "Rock of
Ages" both in Karen and in English, and "The Missionary's Call," which latter
we print, will never be forgotten by those who heard it. The result of his
labors was soon seen in the re-awakening of a mission spirit in the churches,
and in the designation of new missionaries to the Asiatic missions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Vinton, who was still very ill when she arrived in the
country, was endeavoring to <i>rest</i> in her own peculiar way. Though for
most of the time an invalid, yet by holding receptions in her sick-room, or by
taking advantage of her well days for holding "mothers' meetings" or
"conversation gatherings," she managed to do a wonderful work, the results of
which are constantly appearing in the after-history of the mission.</p>

<p><b>THE FIVE-FRANC PIECE.</b></p>
</center>
<p>It was while she was thus "resting" at the home of Deacon Granger at
Suffield, Conn., that the little five-franc piece, which grew to be a chapel,
began its labor of love.</p>
<p>There was living at Suffield a lady by the name of Mary Ann Bestor. She was
quite poor. A five-franc piece had been given her, with which to purchase a
warm dress for winter; but, desiring to contribute something to the cause of
missions, she argued in this way: "This money is my own. If I choose to go
without the dress, and give the money to the Lord, it is my privilege to do
so." Still she was so fearful that it would become known, and she be blamed for
giving from the depths of her poverty, that she concealed the money in the toe
of one of a pair of stockings which she had knit, and, handing them to Myah A,
who had visited her, told him to give them to Mrs. Vinton, and tell her that
the <i>contents of the toe</i> were for the heathen.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Vinton learned how poor the donor was, and that she was depriving
herself of a warm dress thus to give, her heart was touched, and she said,
"This is holy money, and must not go into the general fund."</p>
<p>That evening, on mentioning it to a friend (believed to have been Deacon
Roberts of Hartford), he said, "It is cold weather: Frankie should have a
wrapper;" and he handed her a ten-dollar bill, which she wrapped around the
five-franc piece "to keep him warm." The next day another ten-dollar bill was
given by Deacon Day of Hartford, "to buy Frankie an overcoat, as the weather
had grown colder." Mrs. Henry P. Kent of Suffield, hearing of the circumstance,
said, "These are stinging nights to sleep alone: Frankie must have a
bedfellow;" and a five-dollar gold piece was laid by his side.*</p>
<p>[Footnote: * We are glad to say that the "warm dress" for Miss Bestor was
also forthcoming.]</p>
<p>Mrs. Vinton then said, "If Frankie had a few more wrappers, I would send him
to Boston to buy some Bibles for our Karens." So she wrote out "Frankie's"
history, and sent it to Dr. Ives, saying, "Are there not some of your members
who will clothe Frankie suitably for a journey to the city? He has a good coat
and overcoat, but he sadly wants other articles of clothing."</p>
<p>Dr. Ives keenly appreciated the wit of the letter, and as keenly sympathized
with the missionary spirit that lay beneath the wit. So he read the letter from
the pulpit at a Sunday-morning service. Thirty dollars was at once subscribed
to "purchase Frankie suitable clothes." The amount, in bank-bills, was handed
to Mrs. Vinton; and she sent off "Frankie" to Boston, at the same time writing
his history to the publisher from whom the Bibles were bought.</p>
<p>He returned "Frankie" to Mrs. Vinton, and with him so many of his wrappers
and coats, etc., that she said, "I will send him to Philadelphia, to Dr. Jayne,
to buy a box of medicines for our Karens." The medicines were purchased, and
yet "Frankie" was still sent back to Mrs. Vinton, with a facetious message from
Dr. Jayne.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vinton said, "Now I'll take him to Mrs. Thompson, and let him buy some
<i>eye-water</i> for our poor Karens, who suffer so much from the glare of the
sun." But Mrs. Thompson said, "I have been expecting you, and the box is
already packed and waiting for you; but, bless you! I don't want any of
Frankie's wraps. It is too cold weather to strip a little fellow like
that."</p>
<p>Mrs. Vinton then said, "This money always comes back to me. It is evident
that I have not yet found its true mission; but it shall yet do a good work for
Burmah."</p>
<p>Just at this time Mr. Vinton returned from a tour among the churches, and
she told him "Frankie's" story. He said, after hearing it, "I too have had a
donation which has touched my heart. At Norwich, a Mrs. Chapell came to me, and
tearfully said, handing me a little roll of money, 'This belonged to my poor
boy. I cannot put it into the general fund; but will you, Mr. Vinton, take it,
and apply it to some special purpose?'"</p>
<p>Mrs. Vinton at once said, "That, too, is holy money. It will do to go with
my Frankie;" and, struck with the coincidence of the names and of the thought
which had been for years in her mind, she exclaimed,--</p>
<p>"This money shall build a house for the Lord in Burmah, and it shall be
called <i>Frank's Chapel.</i>"</p>
<p>The story with its singular incidents was repeated by one and another; and
Mrs. Vinton's purpose was freely spoken of, though, we believe never put into
print.</p>
<p>Money soon began to flow in from many sources, designated for "Frank's
Chapel." After a few months Mrs. Vinton visited Philadelphia. Here some friends
said, "We often visit Burmah in imagination; and when we reach there we are
tired enough to sit down. May we not <i>rent pews</i> in Frank's Chapel?"</p>
<p>"Certainly," was the reply. So a plan of a church was drawn, and as fast as
sittings were taken, the names of the pew-holders were written upon it.</p>
<p>Ministers who contributed had their names written on the platform. The
enthusiasm became general in Philadelphia churches; and soon nearly all the
seats were taken, and a convenient communion-service was presented.</p>
<p>From Philadelphia Mrs. Vinton went to Cincinnati, O. The people there said
to her, "Why! you have rented all your pews, and we Western people are crowded
out." So they drew a larger plan, and transferred the Eastern names to it, and
began renting pews themselves.</p>
<p>All through the West this same enthusiasm prevailed.</p>
<p>In Cincinnati the Odd Fellows presented a large and beautifully bound pulpit
Bible, with a suitable inscription.</p>
<p>A fine-toned bell was presented in one place, pulpit-lamps in another, and a
communion-table in a third; and until her departure from this country Mrs.
Vinton received contributions for the building-fund.</p>
<p>In July, 1850, the Missionary Union sent out one of the largest companies of
missionaries which ever sailed from these shores. The company comprised
fourteen missionaries, Dr. and Mrs. Wade, Dr. and Mrs. Kincaid, Dr. and Mrs.
Ward (of Assam), Mr. and Mrs. Whiting, Dr. Dawson (medical missionary), Miss
Shaw, Mr. and Mrs. Vinton, Mr. and Mrs. Bronson. They embarked in "The
Washington Allston." By the time they reached the Cape of Good Hope, Mrs.
Vinton and Mrs. Kincaid had become so exhausted by the fearful hardships of the
voyage in an ill-found ship, that they left the ship, and took passage
(together with Dr. Kincaid) on the English ship "Tudor," for Calcutta. The
voyage to Cape Town occupied eighty-nine days, and was a scene of continued
suffering. From Cape Town to Calcutta the voyage on "The Tudor" occupied only
sixty-eight days, and was an exceedingly pleasant contrast to that which
preceded it. Mr. Vinton remained on "The Allston" until the voyage was
completed, though he suffered severely from sickness, and landed in Maulmain in
an enfeebled state, from which it was months ere he recovered. But we must not
dwell upon these sad occurrences. There is much that is pleasant which may well
occupy our attention.</p>
<p>No sooner had Mrs. Vinton spoken, in Maulmain, of her desire to build
"Frank's Chapel," than she found all the friends of the mission just as ready
to aid in the work as had been the brethren in America. The English friends
joined with the Karens in their desire to contribute, and soon a goodly sum of
money was collected. Some of these contributions were accompanied with
facetious messages, as were the American ones. An English officer sends two
hundred rupees with the message, "In America they gave money to keep Frankie
warm: in view of the high state of the thermometer, I send this to keep him
cool." Another sends one hundred rupees "for legs for Frankie to stand on,"
alluding to the custom of building houses on posts in Burmah. One officer alone
(Gen. Russell) gave one thousand rupees.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vinton supposed herself on the point of realizing her wish,--which was
to build the chapel at the Karen mission-compound in Maulmain (which was called
"Newton"),--when unexpected difficulties occurred. She did not know then that
these "difficulties" were all part of God's plan.</p>
<p>The Lord was about to open at last the Pegu provinces to the gospel of
Christ; and Rangoon, instead of Maulmain, was to become the centre of mission
effort in Burmah, and the field where the Vintons were henceforth to labor,
where they were to reap even more abundantly than they had ever yet done, and
where they were to die and to be buried.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<pre>
"Go, labor on: your hands are weak,
    Your knees are faint, your soul cast down;
Yet falter not: the prize you seek
    Is near,--a kingdom and a crown!

"Men die in darkness at your side,
    Without a hope to cheer the tomb;
Take up the torch, and wave it wide,--
    The torch that lights time's thickest gloom."
</pre>
<p>Mr. Vinton had made frequent journeys into the Rangoon district between the
years 1836 and 1847; and he had baptized many who had joyfully accepted of
Christ, even though they knew that stripes, imprisonments, and perhaps death,
awaited them if their idolatrous rulers discovered that they were "Jesus
Christ's men."</p>
<p>Ko-tha-byu and Mr. Abbott had sowed good seed among the Rangoon Karens; and,
in spite of opposition, little churches had sprung up in many places.</p>
<p>Almost every year Mrs. Vinton had pupils in her school in Maulmain, who had
come over two hundred miles, threading the forests by night, not daring to
travel by day, for the sake of learning to read God's word in their own
language. This desire to read "God's word," by the way, was a remarkable
characteristic of the Karens; and it was this which was the secret of those
educational movements which were so misunderstood, not to say misrepresented,
in America. It took American Christians thirty years to learn that a Karen
would not take his knowledge of the gospel at second hand, but insisted upon
his right to be taught by missionary schools to read in his own tongue "the
long-lost law of his God."</p>
<p>When the pupils who came through so many dangers to obtain this coveted
knowledge returned to their homes at the close of the rainy season, they
carried with them, secreted in their turbans, a copy of the Gospels or of the
Epistles. They knew, that, if found in possession of the "white man's book," a
certain and cruel death awaited them at the hands of their Burman
oppressors.</p>
<p>Truly "they counted not their lives dear unto them," that they might possess
God's truth.</p>
<p>The unwritten, and, alas! now never to be written, martyrology of those
years of woe, has furnished the names of many who were sent to terrible death
for this cause, while others were tortured to the extreme verge of endurance,
yet were faithful to their God. Yet, while these dark scenes were occurring in
the Karen jungles, American Christians were generalizing in annual meetings
upon the exact status of the missionary and his wife, and gravely doubting
whether he was not assuming altogether too much <i>responsibility</i>.*</p>
<p>[Footnote: * I shall never forget the thrill with which I listened to the
recital, by an aged Christian of the Rangoon district, of the terrible torture
which he had himself endured, and which he had witnessed, during these dark
years.--R. M. Luther.]</p>
<p>The portions of Scripture thus carried back by the pupils were secreted in
the earth during the day; but at night, while a guard stood around the house to
give warning of approaching danger, they were drawn from their hiding-places,
and read to eager listeners.</p>
<p>How sweetly did the message of salvation fall upon the still night air! and
how consoling to those poor despised "Karen dogs,"--as the Burmans were wont to
call them,--to learn that God had remembered the Karens, and sent them back the
long-lost law of their God! How gladly did they hear of a redemption purchased
not with silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ! and what
wonder that these same Rangoon Karens went cheerfully to prison, to slavery, to
torture, to death, even the death of the cross?</p>
<p>One day Mrs. Vinton, in Maulmain, was startled by the inquiry, "Mamma, is it
wrong to pray for war?" Such a question from the peace-loving, submissive
Karens, was astounding.</p>
<p>"Why?" was the cautious reply.</p>
<p>"Because we are tired of being hunted like wild beasts; of being obliged to
worship God by night and in the forest, not daring to speak of Jesus, save in a
whisper. O mamma! may we not pray that the English may come and take our
country, so that we may worship God in freedom and without fear?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you may!" she answered; and from that day that one petition made a
part of every prayer which went up from the hundreds of persecuted Christians;
and they looked for the coming of the English guns, and for the protection
which the English flag had ever brought with it, as earnestly as they had
looked for the coming of their "younger brother, the white man."</p>
<p>In 1852 the English government, weary with the repeated outrages upon
English residents in the Burmese dominions, sent an armed vessel from Calcutta
to Rangoon to inquire into the causes of complaint, and to demand redress from
the Burmese governor.</p>
<p>At that time the annexation of the country had not been thought of by the
English government. They had not come prepared for war: all that was demanded
was, that an equivalent for certain confiscated property of English residents
should be paid, and a guaranty given that in future the foreign residents
should be unmolested, and the provisions of the treaty of 1827 should be
observed.</p>
<p>Great was the joy of the Karens when the news spread that the English had
come; and earnest prayers were offered that God would blind the Burmans to
their own interests, and prevent them from acceding to the very reasonable
demands of the English. What was their dismay when told that the steamer had
gone quietly out of Rangoon harbor without firing a gun, and that they were
still left under the iron heel of their oppressors!</p>
<p>But the little "Sesostris" came back one day,--not alone, however. There
were "The Fox," "The Duchess of Argyle," "The Nemesis" (well-named, this latter
vessel, for she had come as the avenger of a long list of black crimes against
humanity).</p>
<p>Had we stood on the old pier at Rangoon, and seen two or three poorly-clad
natives, with passive faces, gazing off into the stream, where lay anchored a
portion of the "Majesty of England," we would have supposed that of all Rangoon
they cared least for the grave political problems which had been perplexing two
governments.</p>
<p>But had we seen the same men, stealing quietly out of the city at nightfall,
passing stealthily under the shadow of the mighty Shway Da-gong, and plunging
into the trackless jungle which lay behind the great pagoda, hastening to the
first Karen village, and arousing the head men,--then passing rapidly by paths
known only to themselves, and warning the scattered hamlets along the Pegu
Yomah Mountains,--we would have realized the truth that an oppressed people
were about to be delivered, and that the coming of the English fleet was
recognized as the answer to a nation's prayer.</p>
<p>So soon as the ultimatum of the English authorities in Calcutta--the
Governor-general and Council of the East India Company--was received by the
Burmans, preparations were made for resistance. The old fortifications in the
vicinity of Rangoon had fallen into disrepair; but the Burmans began rebuilding
the immense stockade around Shway Da-gong, and erecting batteries at various
points on the river-bank, and on the crests of the low hills near the city.</p>
<p>As in former wars, the Karens were compelled to leave their homes to work on
the fortifications, to build bridges, and to cut roads through the pathless
forest, and were even driven at the point of the spear into the ranks to fight
against their deliverers. The Burmans, however, soon found that it was no use
to attempt to make the Karens fight. Not a bullet from a Karen musket ever
reached the English ranks. The Karens either fired into the air, and deserted
in a body to the enemy, or else fell, pierced by the bullets of the men for
whose coming they had so earnestly prayed.*</p>
<p>[Footnote * After one of the skirmishes in front of Rangoon, the English
troops sent out to bury the dead found a number of Karens among the killed.
Upon their breasts were found copies of the Gospels, or fragments of the
Epistles, revealing the fact that they were Christians.]</p>
<p>Before hostilities began, the Burmans made light of the coming of the
English. They would whet their knives before the Karens, and perform their
war-dances, and say, "We will soon drive these pale-faces back into the sea
whence they came. They have no strength, and one Burman can drive a hundred of
the coward red-coats. They took Rangoon once before, but they gave it up again.
You will soon see their ships returning, or else sunk deep in the river; and
then we will make these Karen dogs feel our vengeance. They want the English to
come; and, when we have driven their white friends forever from the country, we
will attend to them. We will flay them alive, roast them over slow fires, and
none shall deliver them out of our hands."</p>
<p>They talked loudly, but ran away at the first fire, save when they were
sheltered by stockades or the curiously shaped pits in which they intrenched
themselves. After some of the fights dead gunners were found chained to the
guns, a happy expedient to keep them from deserting in action. One post after
another fell before the English, one hastily gathered army after another was
defeated, and successive generals were beheaded "<i>pour encourager les
autres;</i>" but the only effect on the Burmans was to increase their rage
against the Karens, whom they regarded as the cause of all their
misfortunes.</p>
<p>They burned their villages and standing crops; they pounded the children to
death in rice-mortars, or threw them into the air, and caught them, as they
fell, upon spears; they tied women to the horns of buffaloes, and tore them
limb from limb; they cut men to pieces, slowly hacking them to death through
successive days. They even, with devilish ingenuity, crucified some Christian
Karens, and, fastening the crosses on rafts, set them adrift upon the river,
that they might be tortured in their intolerable thirst by the sight of the
cooling stream. Some of these unfortunates drifted down to the English fleet
before death put an end to their sufferings. English surgeons did all that was
possible to save them, but in vain.</p>
<p>Tidings of these intolerable sufferings soon reached Maulmain; and Mr.
Vinton, yielding alike to the agonizing cry of the seventeen Karen churches in
Rangoon, the beseeching of Eugenio Kincaid, and the unanimous solicitations of
the missionaries in Maulmain, went at once to Rangoon. Had he waited the six
months which would have been necessary to refer the call of the Rangoon Karens
to the Board of the Missionary Union in Boston, and to have received their
formal authorization of his transfer, he would have escaped the condemnation of
those who afterward blamed him for having "acted on his own responsibility;"
but what was the man to do?</p>
<p>More than this: four months previous a joint letter, signed by Eugenio
Kincaid, Dr. Dawson, and Mr. Vinton, had been sent to Boston to the Missionary
Union, urging the vital importance of Mr. Vinton's remaining in Rangoon, where
he was then on a hurried visit in company with his sister, the devoted Miranda
Vinton. This was before hostilities began. If, in the judgment of such a man as
Dr. Kincaid, it was necessary that Mr. Vinton should take up his residence in
Rangoon at that date, how much more was this necessary when the poor Karen
Christians were being rent and torn, and when according to Mr. Kincaid's
published letter of April, 1857, "three <i>native preachers had already been
crucified</i>, and five thousand refugee Karens were living in carts and under
trees within seven miles of Rangoon, while all the strong, efficient men were
from ten to fifteen miles farther inland, holding the Burman forces in
check!"*</p>
<p>[Footnote: * E. Kincaid, D.D., April, 1857. He says also, in the same
letter, "Every Karen village within fifty miles of Rangoon was burned, and
their stores of rice either seized or destroyed."]</p>
<p>When Mr. Vinton arrived in Rangoon, he found the Burmese part of the city in
ruins. The wells and tanks were choked with dead bodies. Under the ruins of
each native house was to be seen a deep pit. These had been prepared as
hiding-places for the women and children during the bombardment. When the city
was set on fire by the shells, the sight of shrieking women and children
rushing through the flames was described by the survivors as horrible in the
extreme.</p>
<p>Mr. Vinton and Mr. Kincaid obtained permission to occupy two deserted
monasteries inside of the stockade; and, six weeks after the capture of the
city, their families came over from Maulmain.</p>
<p>As soon as it was rumored abroad that "Teacher Vinton" had come, the
refugees who bad been driven from their burning homes, with nothing but the
clothes they wore, and who had been living secreted in the forests and jungles,
subsisting upon roots and herbs and what game they could trap, came crowding
into the city.</p>

<p><b>A BURMAN ZAYAT.</b></p>
</center>
<p>They filled the monasteries in which the Vintons were, and camped out under
the trees on the slope in front of Shway Dagong.</p>
<p>They brought with them almost every imaginable disease; and the cases of
small-pox increased in number so rapidly, that it soon became necessary for Mr.
Vinton to build a hospital for them. With the self-forgetfulness so
characteristic of both himself and wife, this hospital was placed close to
their own house, "<i>so that we could better care for the cases which needed us
most,</i>" Mrs. Vinton simply said. Her first duty in the morning was to make
the rounds of the various buildings and shelters, administering medicine to the
sick, consolation to the bereaved, and infusing new courage into the hearts of
the poor, homeless, dispirited creatures who looked on her as an angel of
deliverance.</p>
<p>A letter written at this time to friends in Woodstock, Conn., will give a
better idea of the scenes of this sad time than any description of ours:--</p>
<blockquote>"Let me introduce to you a few of my suffering family. "In the next
room to us lies Lai-nyo, he and his family all sick with measles. He has been
employed in our Maulmain mission for several years; and, as both he and his
wife were educated under our care, they seem to us like our own children.<br>
<br>
"They must have something to eat and some medicine when we come back; but we
must now step into another building, about ten feet from the corner of our
house.<br>
<br>
"There, nearest the door, lies a poor woman sick with small-pox. She is one of
four thousand refugees who have been driven from their homes, and have been
hiding in the jungle, sleeping on the ground, exposed to the burning heat by
day and the dews by night, for three or four months. When she found she was
taken with this dreadful disease, she said, 'Carry me to <i>the woman</i>. I
will die with her, if I am to die; and, if I get well, I will get well with
her.'<br>
<br>
"She was brought in five or six days ago; but, poor thing! she will soon be
where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest. Behind her
lie her two daughters, ill with the same disease; but they have youth on their
side, and may recover. The husband and father helped to bring them in, but had
to return at once to the encampment to take care of another daughter who was
too ill to be moved.<br>
<br>
"There in the corner lies one of our most promising theological students. He
was taken with small-pox at Kemmendine, and brought in ten days ago. A few
hours after he reached us he heard that his mother and grandmother had been
seized by the Burmans, and most cruelly put to death, some say crucified.<br>
<br>
"But let us go and speak to him. Perhaps you never saw one sick with small-pox.
If not, make up your mind to see suffering. As we pull up the curtains which
are over him to keep the flies off,--oh, what a stench! A mass of corruption
from head to foot! There is not a place as large as the hand which is not one
running sore. The doctor says he cannot live. About two hours ago I came out
here to urge him to take some food.<br>
<br>
"I said, 'What will you have?'<br>
<br>
"'Nothing,' was the reply.<br>
<br>
"'But I have some nice sago and arrowroot; or, if you prefer, I will get you a
cup of tea and some bread.'<br>
<br>
"'No, no: I want neither.'<br>
<br>
"'How is your mind?'<br>
<br>
"'Happy, happy!'<br>
<br>
"'What is your chief desire?'<br>
<br>
"'To get well, and preach the gospel; but all will be right now. If I die, I
will go directly to Jesus. If I live, I will serve him here.'<br>
<br>
"'Is your heart steadfastly fixed on God?'<br>
<br>
"'<i>It is all peace</i>,' is the answer. Yes, precious soul, all is peace
within, notwithstanding this loathsome exterior. Jesus is here, the hope of
glory. If there are missionary trials, there are also missionary joys; and what
can exceed the joy of seeing a soul like this pluming its wings for heaven!
True, we are loath to part with him. We need him to preach the gospel to his
countrymen throughout the jungle. Our only ordained preacher is dead, and the
last two of the assistants, and now we must part with meek and lovely
Pah-yah.<br>
<br>
"Well, we will go on to the girls' boarding-house. It is a poor, rickety thing.
You must stoop to get under the low eaves, and then take a high step to reach
the floor.<br>
<br>
"Just by the door lies a whole family of refugees, sick with the measles, and
one has whooping-cough super-added. The father can just sit up, and lean his
back against a post. He is watching his wife, who is suffering for want of
breath.<br>
<br>
"The measles have struck in upon her lungs, and she cannot live many hours. Her
babe lies crying by her side, sick for want of food and care; for its mother
has not been able to nurse it for two days.<br>
<br>
"Next to her lies the one having both measles and whooping-cough. In the corner
lies the oldest son, just recovering from measles; but he is suffering from
ophthalmia, and is almost stone-blind.<br>
<br>
"Another daughter lies in the next room, sick with dysentery, yet crying for a
plantain. Near her is a widow, whose husband has just died with cholera,
leaving her with four little children. They have all had the measles and
small-pox, and are wasted to mere skeletons.<br>
<br>
"On beyond are several houses yet unvisited; but I spare you. You are not yet
accustomed to so much suffering, and you shudder at it."</blockquote>
<p>After speaking at some length of the reception that same day of a box of
clothing from the ladies to whom she was writing, and after thanking them for
their generous gifts, she says:--</p>
<blockquote>"<i>Evening.</i>--We are seated around the table with brother
Kincaid and family. The opening of a box from America is a matter of so much
rejoicing that we have to call in our neighbors to be glad with us. But, alas!
where is rejoicing? One has come in to tell us that the poor woman's freed
spirit has soared above. After tea we open a bundle of precious books from
America. We read and talk of home. Our feelings are tender; but another
messenger comes to tell us that the other woman has ceased to breathe, and her
child cannot live long; also that Pah-yah cannot speak.<br>
<br>
"Mr. Vinton hastens out to him, but he is insensible. We separate for the night
with sad hearts.<br>
<br>
"<i>Sunday morning.</i>--The sun has risen, bright and cheerful, but, alas! its
cheerful light falls on sad faces.<br>
<br>
"About midnight Pah-yah became stronger, called his friends around him, and
said, 'Let me serve God until the last moment.'<br>
<br>
"He then gave directions about his funeral, how he wished to be bathed, laid
out in clean clothes, and buried.<br>
<br>
"'And now,' said he, 'let us pray.' As the prayer ceased, he was asleep in
Jesus. Oh, what a happy sabbath to him!<br>
<br>
"He has met a martyred mother and grandmother in the presence of the Lamb.<br>
<br>
"The child also died in the night, and all four are to be buried to-day.<br>
<br>
"<i>Tuesday.</i>--Lai-nyo's child died to-day, and we have just buried it. It
seemed like a grandchild to me, but it has gone to sleep on Jesus' breast.
While at breakfast this morning, we saw a man carried by the door to the
hospital. It is a bad case, and somewhat advanced, and I fear will result
fatally; but we must try and smooth his pathway to the grave.<br>
<br>
"Every account from the jungles is one of suffering and sorrow. Our feelings
are continually lacerated by the tales of how the Burmans are robbing,
plundering, burning, and destroying the whole country. The Karens are truly in
the furnace of affliction, <i>but our Father guides.</i>"</blockquote>
<p>The foregoing gives a little glimpse of a part, and but a small part, of the
Vintons' labors during the first year of their residence in Rangoon. Mrs.
Vinton had a large school of some two hundred pupils during most of this time.
In it were gathered old men and women for whom spectacles had to be purchased,
mothers with babes in their arms, fathers and sons sitting on the same bench,
learning to read the word of God; and all listened to the message of salvation
with all the more readiness, because it came from those who had proved their
sincerity by feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, caring for the sick
and dying, and providing for the orphan and widow.</p>
<p>Not a Sunday passed without baptisms. Scarcely a day but what companies came
in from the jungles, some for books and medicine, many for advice and
consolation; and to all was the gospel preached in faithfulness. That was a
glorious harvest-time; and though they had never worked so hard, or passed
through such soul-harrowing scenes, literally weeping with those who wept until
they almost forgot how to smile or be glad, yet Mr. Vinton in after-years often
said, "I would go through it all again for the joy of seeing souls come
flocking into the kingdom, and for the opportunities we then had of doing
good."</p>
<p>Dr. Kincaid, in a letter written about the same time, and published in 1857,
says:--</p>
<blockquote>"The Lord rolled on us an amount of labor never known by us before.
The peoples' hearts were softened like wax. The arm of the Lord was made bare,
and the gospel wrought mightily upon the people. We had Pencostal seasons
almost every week, preaching daily and every evening, male and female
prayer-meetings every week, baptizing converts every sabbath, hundreds cured of
diseases.<br>
<br>
"During the rains two hundred and fifty Karens learned to read the word of God,
who could not read before. Over thirty young men received biblical instruction
preparatory to labor in the distant villages, some as preachers, some as
school-teachers.<br>
<br>
"Such was our work, but not all. Thousands were suffering in all parts of the
country; and they could go nowhere for advice and sympathy except to us, their
teachers. No others could understand their language; no others could feel for
them. Before the rains were over, a new Burmese army, under the command of the
king's father-in-law, and numbering fifteen thousand strong, had fortified
themselves in Pegu. Detachments of three or four hundred in a body were
ravaging the country...Many disciples had fallen by the cruel dagger of the
Burman, or had been sold into slavery...Some five thousand families living in
carts had come within eight miles of Rangoon to escape from the Burmans...We
visited these refugees in the wilderness. We found large numbers of our
disciples, and their thankfulness to see us and hear us was deeply
affecting.<br>
<br>
"They asked Mr. Vinton to sing and pray with them. Such an assembly is rarely
seen."</blockquote>
<p>Steadily did the little English army advance, taking town after town and
fort after fort, all the time offering to treat with their proud and scornful
enemies whenever they should show any desire to come to terms.</p>
<p>It was not, however, until Ava, the "City of the Golden Foot," was
threatened, that the king would yield. A treaty was made, and peace proclaimed;
but it was long ere peace came to the harassed and persecuted Karens. Indeed,
it seemed for a time as if matters were worse than during the war; for
detachments of the disbanded Burman army were flying in every direction; and
wherever they went they left nothing behind them but smoking villages and
mutilated bodies of the dead. In the vicinity of Rangoon, robberies and murders
were of nightly occurrence.</p>
<p>Shortly after peace was declared, it became necessary for the Vintons to
leave the ruined old monastery which had so far sheltered them; and they moved
to a beautiful spot two miles from the stockade, where Mr. Vinton commenced
putting up buildings for the accommodation of his family and of the large
school which followed him to his new home.</p>
<p>The removal was necessitated by an order from the English government,
compelling the vacating of all the religious buildings which had been occupied
during the war.</p>
<p>With the increased accommodation Mrs. Vinton's school increased in numbers;
and she soon had competent teachers trained, not only to lighten her own daily
labors, but to take charge of the village schools which were springing up
wherever the country was sufficiently quiet for the Karens to return to their
homes.</p>
<p>Great anxiety was expressed by the English friends of the mission at its
removal so far from the fort as to Kemmendine; and fears were freely expressed
that they would all be found murdered in their beds: but the "arrow by day and
the terror by night" came not near them. We doubt if there was a man in Burmah
who would lift his hand against Mr. Vinton, so much was he revered and beloved,
both by Karens and Burmans.</p>
<p>After a time, the new buildings at Kemmendine being completed, the work of
the mission began to move on with system and regularity; and the prospect was,
that a few months would behold the country tranquillized, and the greatest
obstacles to jungle-work removed. For a short time the hearts of the faithful
missionaries exulted in the prospect of an extension of the special work of
preaching the gospel in the regions newly opened to the truth. These hopes,
however, were destined to a sad revulsion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<pre>
"Go, labor on: 'tis not for nought;
    Thy earthly loss is heavenly gain;
Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not:
    The Master praises--what are men?"
</pre>
<p>A new trial was coming upon the devoted Karens. They had endured war and
pestilence: now famine, with all its attendant horror, stared them in the face.
Their stores of rice had been burned or stolen, their cattle had been driven
off, and they had neither seed to sow nor buffaloes to till the fields. The
country had been so pillaged and laid waste, that both Burmans and Karens began
to feel the scarcity of food. Ship-loads of rice came from Calcutta, and it was
sold for six and seven times the usual price. Those who had money bought; but
there were thousands who had lost all by robbers, especially among the Karens.
Thousands had eaten their last meal of rice, and were subsisting on wild roots
and herbs.</p>
<p>As children look to their parents for counsel and assistance, so had the
Karens, both Christian and heathen, learned to look to Mr. Vinton; and they
came to him in this new trial.</p>
<p>He commenced giving out the little store of rice which he had laid in for
the school. This was soon exhausted, and he procured a few hundred bushels
more. But the news spread that there was rice at Teacher Vinton's; and the
people began coming in companies, beseeching him for food for their starving
families. The tales of suffering and woe which they brought were
heart-sickening. Stalwart men, emaciated from want, and weary and dusty from
the long journey, bearing in their skinny arms the basket or bag to contain the
rice they hoped to receive, came beseeching aid.</p>
<p>Some fell fainting at Mr. Vinton's door, and must be carried in and
carefully fed back to life, little by little, until sufficiently strong to
venture on the return journey. It was worth something to see the eagerness and
joy with which they started for their homes, carrying with them the precious
treasure that should bring back life and vigor to the wasted forms of wife and
children, lying helpless and ready to die, in the desolate dwellings far away.
Soon the second store of rice was exhausted. Meantime the people were dying in
the streets; and every morning the authorities sent out to collect and bury the
dead.*</p>
<p>[Footnote: * Dr. Kincaid.]</p>
<p>Any one supposed to possess a secret store of rice was murdered in order to
obtain it. A man who lived not half a mile from the mission premises was set
upon one night, was tortured until he told where he had hid the little rice he
had saved, and then, with fiendish cruelty, the robbers forced the dry grain
down his throat, filled his nose and ears with it, and finally drove a sharp
stake down the throat quite through the body, and left him to die. The people
in the adjoining houses heard the cries and screams; but, in that dreadful time
of terror, none dared to interfere. At one time more than thirty government
boats, laden with commissariat stores, were cut off by a band of robbers. Even
an armed mail-boat had been captured by robbers, and the boatmen killed, and
the mails rifled.</p>
<p>Mr. Vinton had given out the last bushel of rice he had in store, and still
there were thousands of suffering Karens who did not know where to look for
their next meal. He was not the man to stand helplessly wringing his hands,
while people were starving to death before his eyes. So soon as the last of the
rice in store was exhausted, he went down to the rice-merchants and said, "Will
you trust me for a ship-load of rice? I cannot pay you now, and I do not know
when I can pay you; for I have received no remittance from America for over a
year. I cannot see this people die before my eyes. If you let me have the rice,
I will pay you as soon as I am able." They answered,--</p>
<blockquote>"Mr. Vinton, take all the rice you want. Your word is all the
security we want. You can have a dozen cargoes if you wish."</blockquote>
<p>He filled his granaries and outbuildings with rice; and the work of
distribution went on. At first he supplied only Christians, and tried to keep a
regular account of the amounts given out; but he found that he could not turn a
starving man away because he happened to be a heathen; and, as the applicants
increased so rapidly, it was useless to attempt to keep a record, and he gave
freely to all who came.</p>
<p>Some of his friends became alarmed and said, "Mr. Vinton, you are ruining
yourself. You do not know the names of one half the people to whom you are
giving this rice. How do you expect to get your pay?"</p>
<p>His answer was, "God will see to that." And He did see to it. Every cent of
the money expended was refunded; and the interest of that money was laid up in
heaven in the jewels that now deck his crown of rejoicing. It is doubtful if,
at the time, even he recognized the importance of this work of love. It was not
till after the famine was over, and he went out among the people, that he found
that that one act had opened the hearts of the heathen to receive the message
which he brought, as nothing else could have done. They gathered around him in
crowds. They brought their wives and children to look upon their deliverer.
They said, "This is the man who saved our lives, and the lives of our little
ones: his religion is the one we want." In the excess of their joy and
gratitude, he had difficulty in preventing some of the heathen from worshipping
him. That was a blessed reaping-time. Thousands were baptized, churches were
organized, chapels and school-houses were built, and the hearts of both Burmans
and Karens were turned toward God as never before.</p>
<p>The Maulmain churches which he had planted during eighteen years of labor,
mourned his absence; but they rejoiced that the Rangoon Karens, who had waded
through such bloody persecution, had such a leader and helper. To-day, though
he has been in his heavenly home more than twenty years, the name of Justus
Hatch Vinton is a talisman through the jungles of all that country. The Karens
speak it with moistened eyes and bated breath: they still say, in hushed tones,
"<i>He saved our lives.</i>"</p>
<p>We have no desire to revive old disputes which have long been settled by the
logic of events, nor to re-awaken differences which have disappeared in the
light of "that City which hath no need of the sun by day, nor of the moon by
night;" but simple justice to the memory of this man of God requires that we
should point out the coincidence in point of time between these remarkably
successful and self-denying labors for Christ and suffering humanity, and the
passing of that vote of censure which resulted in the severance of his
connection with the society of which he had been for more than twenty years a
faithful servant.</p>
<p>His justification has come sooner than he expected. The present wise,
temperate, and enlightened policy of the Missionary Union, which has borne such
wonderful fruits during the past few years, is far more aggressive than the
measures which Justus Vinton even contemplated, and for attempting which he was
so severely censured by some of his brethren of that day.</p>
<p>It has been said that every wholly consecrated life must have its Calvary;
and this, perhaps, may explain why God not only accepted the heartfelt
consecration of his life and labors, to which reference is so frequently made
in his letters of that period, but added yet the heavier cross of
misconstruction, and led him by the <i>via dolorosa</i> which ended in the
sacrifice of cherished friendships, and a reputation which was dearer than
life. This accomplished, he committed himself wholly to Him who judgeth
uprightly; and with one exception, not even in his letters to his nearest
friends, do we find any reference to the troubles of that period. The exception
is in a letter to Rev. N. Brown, dated March 18, 1857. In it he says:--</p>
<blockquote>"With regard to the past, though I have attempted nothing but in
self-defence, I now regret that I should even have done that; that I had not
made this my only answer, '<i>I am doing a great work</i>, and cannot come
down.' As for the future, I ask for nothing, I care for nothing, but my work. I
have no wrongs that I even wish to have redressed. As to an organization, I
have little responsibility. All I ask is one which will not hinder us in our
work. With such an organization, <i>old</i> or <i>new</i>, I am prepared to
co-operate with all the powers I possess. I sent in my resignation, because in
the then existing state of things I became well satisfied that there was
nothing before me, if I continued, but defensive war, and I must have peace and
quiet."</blockquote>
<p>"Sorrowful, yet always rejoicing," he went about the work which was, alas,
too soon to be finished!</p>
<p>He received, in common with the other missionaries* who withdrew from the
Missionary Union on account of the action of the unfortunate deputation, a
cordial invitation to unite with the American Baptist Free Mission Society,
which he accepted so far as to take up a nominal connection with it.</p>
<p>[Footnote: * D. L. Brayton, A. T. Rose, J. S. Beecher, N. Brown, D.D., and
N. Harris.]</p>
<p>Though he received no specified salary from that society, it very kindly
acted as his financial agent in the collection and transmission of funds, and
in the publishing in this country of his reports and letters.</p>
<p>From this time forward, however, the funds which carried on this large
mission were contributed mainly by native Christians and by English residents,
who had for years watched with deep interest the progress of this marvellous
work.</p>
<p>In 1854, at Mr. Vinton's suggestion, the Karens of the Rangoon district had
organized the Karen Home Mission Society, the first society of the kind ever
formed in Burmah, and, so far as we know, the first ever formed on heathen
soil.</p>
<p>The natives were already supporting their own pastors and schools; but this
organization was intended for aggressive work among the heathen. At the first
annual meeting, thirty pastors and three hundred lay delegates were present.
For the special work of sending evangelists to the regions beyond, six hundred
rupees had been raised, and eight men employed. Over two hundred rupees had
been given for Mrs. Vinton's school in the city, and six hundred children had
been taught in the village schools. Three thousand eight hundred and thirty
rupees had been contributed toward the erection of "Frank's Chapel," a work in
which the native Christians took increasing interest. The people pledged
themselves to try to raise five thousand rupees the coming year for benevolent
objects, outside of their home expenses. Two of the principal business-men
promised to give <i>one-half of their profits for the year</i> to the mission.
We are thus minute in these details, because the history of these times has
never been written. Mr. Vinton was not only averse to resorting to popular
methods of advertising his work, but the excessive labors of the last few years
of his life left him but little time for journalizing or correspondence. A
yearly statement of the receipts and expenditures of the mission was carefully
prepared and published, and with this such incidental facts as would assure the
donors that their contributions had been faithfully and conscientiously
applied.</p>
<p>Beyond this, we are almost entirely dependent for information concerning the
last years of his life, upon Mrs. Vinton's letters to her children.</p>
<p>It is time that we should give some further details concerning the building
of "Frank's Chapel," upon the erection of which so much of the future success
of the mission seemed to depend. Sufficient funds had been contributed to
warrant Mr. Vinton in commencing the work. Plans were drawn by Capt. Williams
of the engineer department of the English army; and he, in company with Major
Simpson of the same service, very kindly offered to superintend the erection of
the building without compensation.</p>
<p>The plans furnished by Capt. Williams were for a building much more
elaborate and substantial than had been contemplated at first; but Mr. Vinton
was assured by English residents of Rangoon, that, whatever its cost might be,
it should be paid for.</p>
<p>A beautiful location had been selected at Kemmendine, on a bold natural
terrace overlooking the Rangoon River and the wide-spreading plains of Dalla
beyond. Through the solicitation of English friends, the land necessary had
been made a free gift to the mission by Lord Dalhousie, the Governor-General of
India,</p>
<p>On the 20th of May, 1855, with most interesting ceremonies and earnest
prayers, the corner-stone was laid by Mr. Vinton, in the presence of a large
assembly of native and English friends. The building, when completed, was to be
sixty by seventy feet, two stories high; the lower part being designed for a
schoolroom, and the upper part for the church services. It was built in the
most substantial manner, of brick, and was admirably adapted for the purposes
for which it was designed. It was to be used, not alone for the ordinary
services of the mission, but as an assembling place for the Home Mission, the
associations, and general conventions. The Rangoon Karen Mission was, at this
time, the largest in Burmah; and a want had long been felt for a building
sufficiently commodious to receive the large numbers who gathered at the
meetings of its missionary organizations.</p>
<p>It stands to-day, after twenty-five years, as the VINTON MEMORIAL.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<pre>
"Less, less, of self each day,
    And more, my God, of thee;
Oh keep me in the way,
    However rough it be!

"Less of the flesh each day,
    Less of the world and sin;
More of thy Son, I pray,
    More of Thyself within."
</pre>
<p>The mission was now definitely settled at Kemmendine, on the land, the
purchase of which was the objective point in the vote of censure passed by the
brethren at home upon Mr. Vinton. The work was systematized and divided into
departments. Mrs. Vinton had the entire charge of the Pegu High School,
numbering from two hundred to two hundred and fifty pupils.</p>
<p>Mr. Vinton had, during the rains, a theological class of young men, who were
soon to go forth as the noble band of native preachers, which is now the
strength and stay of the Rangoon and Bassein missions.</p>
<p>This work of teaching was irksome to him, as he felt that his special work
was to preach; but it was imperatively necessary that the young native
assistants should at least know enough of systematic theology to enable them to
answer the objections urged by the heathen, particularly the Buddhists, with
whom they came in contact. His labors were confined <i>exclusively</i> to
theological instruction, as the general educational work was conducted by Mrs.
Vinton.</p>
<p>She was an instructor of the most marked ability, and was especially gifted
with a fertility of resource, and a tact for expedients, which contributed in
no small degree to her extraordinary success as an educator. Many theories of
instruction, which are only now being tried in America, were successfully
reduced to practice by her thirty years ago.</p>
<p>The public examinations of her schools were always largely attended by
English officers and their wives, who took a deep interest in her work, both in
Maulmain and Rangoon, and who contributed most generously to its support.</p>
<p>An article which appeared in the "Witness" after her death, speaking of her
ability, says:--</p>
<blockquote>"As a teacher, she had few, if any, equals. When on her way to this
country she spent some weeks in England, and went to visit an old friend in
Bristol. The gentleman was the superintendent of a very large mission school in
the suburbs of the city; and he spoke, as he was going to his post of duty, one
sabbath, in regard to a class of rowdy half-grown boys, saying that nothing
could be done with them unless the police were there. Mrs. Vinton said, 'I
think I could manage them without the assistance of a police officer.' Her
friend replied that he should like to see her try.<br>
<br>
"She went and took her seat in the midst. Her presence and her words were like
the music before the evil spirit of Saul. The lions were lambs.<br>
<br>
"This was repeated with the same result every sabbath while she remained there;
and is it too much to expect that the seeds of truth, then implanted in their
hearts, will bring forth in some of those outcasts the fruits of repentance and
holiness?"</blockquote>
<p>She was not only a good instructor, but an excellent disciplinarian as well.
True, she had the gentle and yielding Karens to deal with; yet it was no small
task to keep two hundred and fifty pupils in order, both in the school and out
of it, and especially when the matter was complicated by the presence of a few
Burmese boys in the school.</p>
<p>Her remedy for the use of foul language (a vice very common in that country)
was to call the whole school together, and make the offenders publicly wash out
their mouths with strong soapsuds; and her discipline generally appealed to the
feelings of self-respect, which she maintained could be developed in the most
ignorant and degraded by judicious treatment.</p>
<p>Besides teaching, conversing with the companies of heathen who came in
daily, conducting prayer-meetings and children's meetings, acting the part of
physician and nurse to her own pupils and the sick in the neighborhood, making
and translating books, writing hymns, travelling from village to village
instructing the people, she yet found time to educate her two children with
such fidelity and efficiency that she had fitted Brainerd for college in all
but Greek before he was fifteen; and Calista, when sent to America in 1854, was
found to be prepared to enter classes of girls much older than herself.</p>
<p>When she travelled in the jungles her children accompanied her in the boat,
and they were expected to learn their lessons as regularly as when they were in
town.</p>
<p>She had an endless fund of expedients for interesting them in their studies;
and many were the privileges and pleasures granted, upon condition that the
lessons for the day were well learned.</p>
<p>One of her masterpieces of strategy in her children's estimation was when
she taught them the rudiments of Greek without their knowing it. One day when
they were six and eight years respectively, they begged her for a new
picture-book, saying that they had looked at their old ones until they were
tired. She promised, that, if they would have their lessons well learned that
day, she would find something for them in their father's library.</p>
<p>On going, however, to the study, she could find nothing new but two little
Greek Introductions. They were profusely illustrated after the "New-England
Primer" style, each letter of the alphabet having an object underneath it, the
name of which began with the same letter, as A for *, B for **. These books she
carried to the children as a great prize. The new names for these familiar
creatures were repeated to them, to their great delight; and, at the end of
half an hour, though they had not seen a quarter of the pictures, the books
were solemnly closed, and taken away, with the promise, "If you have perfect
lessons to-morrow, you can have these beautiful books for half an hour
again."</p>
<p>[Transcriber Note: * Greek Character {Alpha-Lamda-Omicron-Pi-Eta-Xi}]</p>
<p>[Transcriber Note: ** Greek Character
{Beta-Omega-Delta-Iota-Omicron-Nu}]</p>
<p>Never were lessons better learned or more perfectly recited; and, for
another half-hour, they revelled in the queer words and quaint pictures. Day
after day did this little farce go on. They soon learned to read and translate
the easy sentences; and they thought that of all games their ingenious mother
had ever invented, this was the most delightful. They could repeat the Lord's
Prayer and Ten Commandments as readily in Greek as in English.</p>
<p>One day their mother said, "Children, don't you think it is time for you to
take up the Greek grammar?" Brainerd burst into tears, and said, "You don't
think I'm old enough to study Greek; do you, mother?"</p>
<p>"Why, my son," what have you been doing for these last months?"</p>
<p>"Why, I thought I was playing. I did not know I was studying Greek."</p>
<p>When he found how he had been thus innocently betrayed into studying Greek,
he revolted and said, "Well, I won't be fooled into Latin in that way. I won't
begin that till I'm ten years old."</p>
<p>In 1855 Mr. Vinton parted with his two children, and sent them to America to
complete their education. This seemed to be the sorest trial which had yet
befallen him. Mrs. Vinton had kept them with her in that unhealthy climate
longer than was commonly deemed prudent, because she feared that one or both
parents might die during their absence at school; and she wished them to remain
until they had received the impress of their father's strong mind and devoted
character, and until the memory of both father and mother might become clear
and distinct, in case parents and children should not meet again.</p>
<p>It was wisely done; for Brainerd and Calista never saw their father's face
after the day, when, kneeling with them in their state-room on the "Fire
Queen," he commended them, with sobs and broken utterances, to the care of a
covenant-keeping God.</p>
<p>Nothing but loyalty to Christ led to such a sacrifice as this. In a letter
written to her children, Mrs. Vinton says,--</p>
<blockquote>"More than a hundred times have I asked myself the question, 'Have
I done right? Is it for the best?' Your father and I have made it a subject for
prayer for years; and we felt convinced, that, should we keep you here, we
should be sacrificing your future good and future usefulness to our own selfish
feelings. But my heart cries out for you, my children, and I sometimes think,
'Why should I have to commit them to the care and training of others, when
both, Calista especially, need a mother's love and guidance?'<br>
<br>
"But my duty to these dear Karens, my duty to the heathen, my duty to Christ,
all demand it; and that is enough. All I can do now is to lay you on the kind
bosom of our dear Saviour by constant prayer. Oh! what should I do in this hour
of trial, if I could not look up and say, 'Lord Jesus, I have done this for
thee and for thy cause. Take the dear ones into thy special care. Raise them up
kind friends, to do more and better for them than we could have done'?<br>
<br>
"It is my daily prayer that this trial may be sanctified to each one of us, and
that we, as a family, may be more pious, more devoted, than ever.<br>
<br>
"Should the Lord permit you to reach America, complete your education, and then
bring you both back as missionaries of the Cross, how happy should we be! I
should feel like saying, 'Now lettest Thou thy servant depart in peace; for
mine eyes have seen thy salvation.' We are all in his hands, either to live or
die, as is for his glory."</blockquote>
<p>How fully were her prayers answered in every respect! God raised up friends
and guardians for her children; and the judicious training and tender parental
care which Calista received in the home of Rev. D. Ives, D.D., of Suffield, and
his devoted wife, left nothing to be desired by the most anxious of mothers. It
was no slight privilege to spend three years in such a Christian home as
that,--to be under the moulding and elevating influence of a man who walked
with God as did Dr. Ives; and Mrs. Vinton often expressed her thankfulness to
God for permitting her daughter to enjoy such rare opportunities for the
development of a high Christian character.</p>
<p>In Deacon and Mrs. Pierce of Hamilton, N.Y., Brainerd also found those who
did all that was possible to supply the place of father and mother. The Lord
took care that while the parents were sacrificing so much for him in heathen
lands, the children lacked for no good thing.</p>
<p>In the midst of more abundant labors than ever, Mrs. Vinton found time to
write often to her children; and these letters are filled with earnest
exhortations to greater consecration and deeper piety, and also with accounts
of her work. In one letter she says,--</p>
<blockquote>"It is now six weeks since we locked up our house, and have been
wandering in the jungle, not stopping at any place more than three days; at
some villages only one, and at others only a few hours. Travelling by day in a
tropical sun, and in the damp chilling airs by night, midst dense jungle and
tall cane-brakes, with the long wet grass rubbing against our faces and cutting
them like saw teeth,--travelling sometimes on foot, sometimes on ponies,
sometimes in buffalo-carts, sometimes in native canoes so small that we dare
not laugh lest we upset them, or think a big thought lest we sink them, sitting
up till late at night talking to the multitudes who throng us, and then rising
at two or three o'clock in the morning for a fresh start before the sun
rises,--this has been our mode of life for the past six weeks.<br>
<br>
"But our hearts have been filled with one constant hymn of praise, as we see
the readiness of the heathen to listen to us, and the deep affection which the
dear disciples manifest for us. I sometimes wish I could know that they love
God as well as they do us. We are literally loaded with presents. It is amusing
to see the quantities of fowls, eggs, ducks, rice, and milk, which they bring
in. At some villages they kill pigs for us; and at one place I overheard the
order given to kill a buffalo, but I forbade it. I told them to keep their
buffalo to plough their fields and draw their cart. We could not eat the half
they brought us, and sent what we did not need to the school in the city.<br>
<br>
"We have penetrated into some dark regions this year. You remember how last
season the heathen ran away from us at Mawloo; but had you been with me last
Thursday, you would have seen a still more ridiculous sight. I rode over from
Pa-rah's village on horseback; and to see a woman riding, and a white woman
too, brought out the whole village, yet when I arrived they would not venture
up into the house.<br>
<br>
"I sat down where they could not see me unless they came up. They then ventured
to the top of the notched stick of timber which led up into the house, and
stood gazing at me. I spoke kindly, and said, 'Come and sit down, my sisters;'
but they preferred to keep their feet ready for a sudden retreat. As there was
a great multitude still standing on the ground, who could not get up to see me,
I rose, and went into an inner room, and sat down at the farther end, and
gathered my little troup of boys and girls who had followed me from the other
village.<br>
<br>
"Taking out our hymn-books, we began to sing. This brought up scores of them;
and I continued to sing, not raising my eyes from my book till the room was
more than half full of women and children. At last I thought that it would do
to speak to them. So, as I was sitting on a low stool, I took it up gently, and
moved smilingly toward them; but, before I had taken two steps, they shrieked,
and ran like a flock of sheep with a wolf at their heels. I sat down, and
laughed outright at them, and succeeded in stopping a few, with whom I talked
until the head man and his secretary and their wives came to see me; and then
all fear seemed to vanish, except that some of the mothers feared that the
'kalah,' or spirit, would leave their children in consequence of seeing me, and
went off muttering 'Pruh kalah! pruh kalah! kalah k'hah,' which is a prayer to
the Nats.<br>
<br>
"Your father has placed Maw-yah-poh and his wife there, and we expect a church
will be formed before next year. Even here, at this heathen village, more than
a dozen have brought in money for Frank's Chapel; saying they see us so hard at
work for the Karens that they wish to help us. We hope that some seven or eight
villages where we have been will receive the gospel. Wherever we go, even among
the heathen, we are treated with the utmost kindness. They frequently speak of
our having saved their lives during the famine. Truly that was the best
investment we ever made: the bread then cast upon the waters is now
returning.<br>
<br>
"You must always keep in mind that you are the children of missionaries, and
that if you are careless of your demeanor, or do any thing wrong, it will be a
disgrace to the dear cause."</blockquote>
<p>This latter injunction had been so often repeated, that the sense of the
responsibility rested on the children's minds, perhaps even more heavily than
the parents intended.</p>
<p>Calista, then a girl of fifteen, says that while at school, and during her
vacations, she felt as if the whole credit of the cause of Foreign Missions
rested upon her shoulders, and that any inconsistency in her conduct, either as
a school-girl or as a Christian, would bring hopeless disgrace on the cause
which was so dear to her parents.</p>
<p>Again Mrs. Vinton writes,--</p>
<blockquote>"The Lord is providing for all our wants. Had any one told me
twenty years ago that a boy then in my school would send me a bag of eight
hundred rupees, and promise two hundred more soon, I would not have believed
it. Lewis Raymond feels that God has called him to preach; and he is going to
give up his lucrative situation under Government, and complete his study of
theology, and then go to his great work.<br>
<br>
"He has hitherto contented himself with paying the expenses of another to
preach in his stead, but it does not satisfy him; and now he must go himself.
Dr. Balfour has just sent two hundred and twenty rupees more for the
school.<br>
<br>
"His father is a clergyman in Scotland; and he sends all the letters which I
write to him, to his father. He allowed a friend to read my last letter, and he
sent twenty rupees for the privilege of reading it. Chah too, my old cook, is
married, and has gone to preaching...You know how anxious I felt for the
conversion of our syce (the man who takes care of the pony), and how much we
have prayed that he might be a Pwo preacher. I do trust that our hopes are
about to be realized. He has spent all his spare time in studying; and last
evening brother Brayton asked me if I would allow him to go to Kemmendine on a
preaching excursion with him. I said 'Yes! with all my heart. It is our great
desire that the Lord may call him away from the stable, and set him to
preaching.' He is the best syce we ever had; and, in all the three years he has
been with us, I have never had occasion to reprove him once; but I will gladly
give him up to the work of preaching, and take another raw lad to train in his
place.<br>
<br>
"Last evening Nau Oo-thah lingered around after all the rest had retired, and
finally said, 'I love to be with you, mamma, very much; but I hear there is a
great village near Parah's place where they do not worship God, but where they
say they will have a school; and I want to go and teach it, if mamma is
willing. I told her that it was the greatest joy of my heart to train boys and
girls for the service of God, and that, although she was my right-hand girl and
a great help to me, yet if the Lord had called her, as he had done Nau Nai-nau
and Nau Poh, I would release her at once, and put Nau Mee tha in her place,
till she was trained and qualified to go and serve God too.<br>
<br>
"Many ask me how it is that I am always training raw Karens, and, as soon as
they begin to be useful to me, let them go from me. It <i>is</i> trying,
especially when for weeks together we have unsavory and half-cooked dishes,
prepared by a new hand in the cook-house; but it is a part of my missionary
work. No one is so blest in their help as I am. My girls and boys serve me, not
for money, but to improve themselves and prepare for future usefulness; and I
trust that many of them will preach and teach when I am dead and gone.<br>
<br>
"Major Simpson has sailed for England; and, about a week after, Capt. Brander
sent us one hundred and fifty rupees, with a note from Major Simpson, saying it
was for our own personal expenses. Since that we have learned that he has sent
all his furniture to be sold at auction, with the order that the avails are to
be given to our school. This will realize some two hundred rupees more at
least.<br>
<br>
"Yesterday Capt. Seymour sent thirty rupees over and above what he has given
lately for the mission, saying, 'This is for your <i>own</i> use.' It is quite
opportune; for sister ---- has been with us for a fortnight, so ill that she
was not expected to recover, and we have had to watch her, and fan her night
and day, to keep the breath of life in her.<br>
<br>
"I have looked forward to this vacation, hoping that I could rest a little; for
I was feeling quite worn out with my school-work through the rains, and this is
the vacation that the Lord has sent me. But we are happy still; for it is all
the Lord's work, and he sends it to us to do."</blockquote>
<p>Seldom do we see workers who rejoiced more in doing the will of Him who had
sent them than these two.</p>
<p>An English lady writes to a friend:--</p>
<blockquote>"The Vintons are the happiest family I ever met. They were happy
after their beloved sister Miranda left; they are happy now, though their
children are far away; they are happy through trial and suffering; they are
<i>always</i> happy in their work."</blockquote>

<pre>
"Yes, o'er me, o'er me, he watcheth,
    Ceaseless watcheth, night and day:
Yes, even me, even me, he snatcheth
    From the perils of the way.

"Thus I wait for his returning.
    Singing all the way to heaven;
Such the joyful song of morning,
    Such the tranquil song of even."
</pre>
<p>It has been said that no lady missionary ever travelled as extensively as
Mrs. Vinton. Whether this is so or not, she had many varied experiences, and
had an opportunity during the thirty years of her missionary life to try almost
every mode of conveyance, from the elegant barouche of an English friend, to
being carried over a nullah in the arms of two natives, or being jolted nearly
into fragments in a springless native cart, drawn by a pair of runaway
buffaloes.</p>
<p>We give one experience out of many:--</p>
<blockquote>"When we came down to the river again yesterday only one yoke of
buffaloes could be found; and they were so wild, that they would not come near
the chapel.<br>
<br>
"They were harnessed to a cart, and blindfolded, while I tried to get into the
cart; but the moment I came near they threw their noses up into the air, and
snorted, kicked, and plunged, so that they had to be taken out. I then got into
the cart, lay down, and covered myself up entirely from sight; but now the
buffaloes would not come anywhere near it, so I walked on to the next
village.<br>
<br>
"Here we found some people loading carts with rice to take to the river to
sell. They asked me to go with them; but there was no place for me to ride,
save on the tongue of the cart, right between the buffaloes. They put in a
footstool; and I carefully crept over the paddy (unhulled rice), and seated
myself on my precarious seat, not daring to raise an umbrella all the way to
screen me from the burning sun for fear of frightening the buffaloes. As I rode
along, having no little daughter to beguile the weary time with her chatter, I
was left to my own reflections. First, I recollected the missionary address I
heard in Cincinnati, in which the speaker tried to prove that modern missions
ought to be far more successful than ancient missions, because 'of the modern
facilities for travel by steamers and railways, and sending gospel messages by
telegraph.'<br>
<br>
"Oh! thought I, how I wish Mr. B. could come here and try it one dry season,
and look upon the heathen world as it is, not as Christianity has made the
civilized world. Again, I thought of the great congregations in America, who in
their gorgeous churches sit and sing,--<br>
<br>
'Waft, waft, ye winds, his story,<br>
And you, ye waters, roll;'<br>
<br>
"and I exclaimed, 'How different to us, poor matter-of-fact people, who go to
carry the gospel on our tongues, is the work, from what it seems to those who
commission the winds and the waves to do their duty.'<br>
<br>
"The easterly winds that are now sweeping through these jungles, drying, yea,
scorching up every thing in their course, do not in the least help us, but give
us a fever for six hours in the day.<br>
<br>
"As for the waters, they only aid us when compelled so to do by the sturdy
sinews of eight resolute oarsmen. The gospel will doubtless introduce
railroads, steam-boats, and telegraphs, but not till many more missionaries
have first wandered, with tired limbs and dusty clothes, through rice-fields
and jungles, from village to village, <i>waking up</i> intellect, and the love
and fear of God, in these wild ignorant people.<br>
<br>
"By the time the religion of Jesus Christ has taken such deep root that foreign
aid or missionaries will not be needed, it will do for Christians to sit and
sing<br>
<br>
'Waft, waft, ye winds, his story,'<br>
<br>
"and to blame missionaries because they are not more successful than Paul, who
had no railroad to travel on, or Peter, who had no electric telegraph by which
to send his gospel messages. For the present we must content ourselves to sit
cramped up in our little canoes, threading these noble rivers and winding
nullahs even to their very sources, or to be shaken to a jelly in these
springless buffalo-carts, or, what is preferable to those who have the
strength, go on foot."</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Vinton, on his inland tours, rode an elephant or a horse. He had a
sturdy little pony, trained to follow the path without any guidance; and he was
accustomed to do much of his studying while in the saddle.</p>
<p>This method had its disadvantages, for it was liable to sudden
interruptions. On more than one occasion, while passing through the dense
jungle, a low hanging creeper or trailing vine caught him, while the pony
passed on, leaving the astonished rider lying on his back in the jungle-path,
wondering what had happened.</p>
<p>When travelling by elephant, the sagacious brute would clear the path of all
overhanging boughs, and the reader could pursue his studies uninterrupted. Yet,
on one occasion, the elephant put a sudden stop to a lesson in the Greek
Testament. Mr. Vinton had paused at a wayside village for the noontide rest,
and was sitting reading his Testament on the veranda of a native house. He
called to one of his attendants to bring him some water. His elephant, standing
near, heard the order, gravely stalked off to the village tank, and, seizing a
basin, filled it with water; and, coming back, poured it upon Mr. Vinton's
head, while he sat absorbed in his studies!</p>
<p>Sometimes he travelled on foot, accompanied by his little band of helpers;
threading the forests, climbing the mountains, exposed to wild beasts by night
and the scorching sun by day, and yet counting it all joy that he might be
permitted to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vinton gives some interesting details in a letter to the
children:--</p>
<blockquote>"We arrived at this village a few days ago. Since then, your clear
father has gone away to the mountains,--to a region where a white man has never
trod, and where the blessed gospel of the Son of God has never yet been
preached. The Christians here feel very anxious about him; and all pray for him
daily, that he may be kept from the dreadful jungle-fever so prevalent
there.<br>
<br>
"Had he gone for any other purpose than to carry the gospel, I should feel
anxious; but he is in the Lord's hands. He has gone on foot through a pathless
jungle, and has taken with him young men, to place as school-teachers and
preachers if he finds people disposed to receive them. We are very much
encouraged by the reports which come in from the villages. Mau Yay reports
having baptized fifty-four lately; and a number are awaiting the ordinance at
Gna-dee's village. We have been spending a day in fasting and prayer for the
outpouring of God's Spirit on his work. We are asking God for a shower of
divine grace, which shall bring all these surrounding districts into the
kingdom of heaven. We are looking for, and expecting, greater and greater
things.<br>
<br>
"God has accompanied this work from the first with special marks of his divine
favor, and has sent us such great and precious blessings, that we have
covenanted with him that we will not complain of any affliction or trial, if he
will only be with us, blessing our labors, and making us the instruments of
bringing thousands and thousands to righteousness.<br>
<br>
"How I wish, dear children, that you could hear the Christian Karens pray for
you! They are daily asking God to spare your lives, and bring you back to this
country to be their teachers. It is their great fear lest the luxuries and
comfort of America may so charm you that you will not want to return to the
hard work and privations of our life here; and hundreds of prayers are going up
daily for you. How holy and devoted you ought to be! for you are the children
of many prayers. Your father and I have recently been trying to lay you again
upon the altar of God, and dedicate you anew to his service. If you live, you
are the Lord's. If you die, you are still the Lord's. Do try to give yourselves
wholly unto him."</blockquote>
<p>In another letter she speaks of the receipt of "120 Rs. from Major Burton,
100 Rs. from Major Hawkins, 80 Rs. from Lieut. Moxon, for the mission work,
besides 669 rupees from Gen. Russell, for Frank's Chapel, in addition to 200
Rs. given a short time previous; also 50 Rs. from the venerable Bishop Wilson
of Calcutta." She adds,--</p>
<blockquote>"You will laugh to know that 100 Rs. has just come in from Shway
Gan, Capt. Sparks's head man. He once said that he feared no man on earth but
Mr. Vinton, and that he feared him more than he did the Devil. Nothing but the
Lord's grace could have opened his wicked heart to have given thus much for the
chapel. "All of Mr. Williams's surveyors gave more than one-eighth of their
wages for the season, for the chapel; so we feel encouraged to go on with the
school of nearly two hundred pupils, feeling sure that if the Lord can levy
tribute upon such a man as Shway Gan, he can do it upon others."</blockquote>
<p>A touching, yet amusing incident occurred about this time, which we will
give in Mrs. Vinton's own graphic words:--</p>
<blockquote>"I must tell you about <i>our carriage!</i> Some of the Maulmain
Karens, who were once boys in our school, and who were baptized by Mr. Vinton,
came around here with sixty or seventy elephants to work in the Teak forests.
The Government, wishing to purchase elephants for service in putting down the
mutiny in Bengal, requested us to call on the Karens. We did so; and they have
sold over fifty elephants to Government at a handsome price, over six hundred
rupees per head. They said they wished to give some of the profits to the Lord,
and some to us, their old teachers.<br>
<br>
"They first put down <i>fourteen hundred rupees</i> for the mission, and then
said they wanted to do something for us personally. They said we had now been
laboring for the Karens twenty-three years, and had never owned a carriage; so
they went to Mr. Shafraz's, and partly engaged one for 650 Rs., and paid 6 Rs.
as earnest-money. Mr. Craig hearing of it said, that though it was a good one,
yet Gen. Bell had one for sale, equally good and strong, and that he would send
his butler, Ramsawmy, with Mr. Vinton, to look at it.<br>
<br>
"He did so; and Mr. Vinton, while telling the dear, good general how grateful
it was to him to see such a manifestation of feeling upon the part of his
Maulmain children, added, 'I will take the carriage to please them, but will
credit it to the mission. For no one shall prevent me from glorying that I have
preached a free gospel; and I will still show them that I sought not theirs,
but them.'<br>
<br>
"The general said, 'Then you cannot, conscientiously, receive a present from
your people without crediting it to the mission?'<br>
<br>
"Mr. Vinton said 'No.'<br>
<br>
"'Well, then,' said the general, 'have you any scruples about receiving a gift
from me?'<br>
<br>
"Mr. Vinton was nonplussed, but answered 'No.'<br>
<br>
"'Then,' said the general, 'I present you with the carriage.'<br>
<br>
"The Karens went over, and drew it back to our house with great delight. It is
a very strong and handsome carriage, and will be a great comfort to us. But
what pleases us the most, is to see how glad every one is for us to have
it.<br>
<br>
"Ramsawmy ran every step of the way back to Mr. Craig's; and, when he told them
about it, they clapped their hands for joy, and cried, 'Good, good!'<br>
<br>
"'Ramsawmy said he hoped the general would give the carriage; but, if he had
not given it, <i>he himself intended to have given a part of it.</i>' Thus you
see God is still raising up friends, both native and European, to minister to
our wants. Ought we not to be good and faithful?<br>
<br>
"One of the principal owners of the elephants was Nya Pee, Myah A's brother,
who was born soon after we arrived in the country. They expect to give the
mission another thousand rupees before they return to Maulmain. How gladly
would we again go around to Maulmain, visit those dear churches, and labor for
their spiritual interests, should the Lord open the door! Perhaps when you come
back. He will do so; and Brainerd may yet preach to those who, in that terrible
sickness, when he was a babe, so earnestly prayed for his life...Our
examination is over. I was nearly sick for a week before it commenced; but
special strength seemed given me, so that I was enabled to go through with the
examination of all the different classes.<br>
<br>
"Gen. and Mrs. Bell were there; Major and Mrs. Burton, Major and Mrs. Lys,
Major and Mrs. Magoun, Capt. and Mrs. O'Connell, Capt. and Mrs. Power, and many
others. The school acquitted itself so well that an officer present said, 'This
is the finest sight in all Burmah.'<br>
<br>
"Dear, good Mr. Craig was there of course. He has lately given us two hundred
rupees, to be sent to America to be divided between you two. Another donation
for the mission, of over two hundred rupees, comes unexpectedly from
Secunderabad, through Major MacFarlane. How can we ever indulge in doubt, or
fear that all necessary means for carrying on this great work will not be
forthcoming, even though we do not know from day to day how or whence our wants
are to be supplied?<br>
<br>
"I must tell you one out of a hundred similar instances of a Father's tender
care for our wants. One Saturday Mr. Vinton returned after a long jungle tour.
It was the close of the month, and his coolies were expecting their wages. We
had not a rupee in the house, and a large school looking to us for their daily
food. For a moment our hearts sank within us; and we said, 'What shall we, what
<i>can</i> we, do? Here are the coolies expecting and needing their pay, here
is this large school to be supported, and not a rupee at our command!' After a
few moments of prayer, Mr. Vinton's faith triumphed; and he said, 'Have the
children nothing to eat for the sabbath?'--'Oh, yes!' was the reply: 'the last
rupee was paid out this morning to obtain supplies for the sabbath.'<br>
<br>
"'Very well, then,' said he, 'I am relieved. We will wait, and see what God
will do for us then.'<br>
<br>
"Early on Monday morning a friend put a roll of forty rupees in his hands. This
enabled him to pay off his coolies, and buy necessary food, both for the school
and for our own family.<br>
<br>
"After breakfast he called on a friend who said, 'Mr. Vinton, I have a bag of
money here for your mission.' The next day another friend sent in one hundred
and five rupees, and the next fifty rupees; and thus God put it into the hearts
of friends to send us relief just in the time of need, and without our saying
one word to them about it. God has so manifestly rebuked our unbelief, that we
shall be doubly guilty in the future not to trust his providential
care."</blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<pre>
"Footsore and worn thou art,
    Breathless with toil and fight:
How welcome now the long-sought sleep
    Of this all tranquil night!

"Rest for the toiling hand,
    Rest for the thought-worn brow,
Rest for the weary, way-sore feet,
    Rest from all labor now."
</pre>
<p>We give these facts just as they occur in the scanty memorials which are
still left. They are collected in the main from letters which were preserved
without any thought of their being used in the preparation of a biography. One
cannot read these letters without noticing the generous amounts of money,
which, after the separation of Mr. Vinton from the Missionary Union, were given
by his English friends. We find in the Second Annual Report of the Rangoon
Karen Mission, published in October, 1857, the large sum of sixteen thousand
and thirty-nine rupees credited as having been received up to that date from
this source alone. From the Karens, nine thousand two hundred and twenty-two
rupees had been given; and from friends in America, during the same time,
rupees four thousand six hundred and sixty-four.</p>
<p>The warm attachments formed between the Vintons and officers of the English
civil and military service did not cease when these latter were ordered to
England, or to other stations in India. The son and daughter still receive
letters from those, who, speaking after the manner of men, twenty-five years
ago stood between their parents and utter failure, during that "<i>crisis in
Brother Vinton's affairs</i>," which a now venerable doctor of divinity
gleefully boasted he would bring about.</p>
<p>The prospect for "Brother Vinton," indeed, was not very bright; but God
brought light out of darkness, and we doubt not that, in that upper and better
world, he will be the first to greet the venerable doctor, and to assure him
that he builded better than he knew.</p>
<p>Amid all these encouragements, however, the glorious success of the work,
the wealth of hearty friendship, as expressed in generous gifts, and the
prospect of largely increased usefulness in the mission,--it was plainly seen
by those who knew him best, that his strength was slowly giving way under the
strain to which he had been subjected.</p>
<p>Himself the very soul of honor, he seemed utterly confounded and unable to
understand the action which had separated him from the society, which, up to
the last moment of his life, he loved with the devotion of a first love.
Indeed, on one occasion, when he would have been wholly justified in obtaining
legal redress for a pecuniary wrong done him, the only expression which can be
discovered is one of dazed amazement that a Christian brother could be guilty
of such a thing.</p>
<p>It was impossible that a soul so sensitive and so tenacious of its
friendships could pass through the scenes of 1854 and 1855, and the sundering
of old ties, without receiving a mortal wound.</p>
<p>His heart was slowly breaking under the misconstructions of good men,--men
whom he never ceased to love, and for whom he continued to pray until the last
day of his life. Yet all this, though it seemed to his friends so hard to
understand, was the process through which it pleased God that he should pass,
ere there was developed in him that entire surrender of will which he so much
desired.</p>
<p>For months before he died he was so evidently ripening for heaven that his
wife said tremblingly, "Surely he is not long for this world." For nearly
twenty-five years she had walked by his side, a daily witness to his tender,
Christ-like spirit, his utter devotion to the one work of saving souls, and the
steady growth in grace which marked his whole life; but the higher life to
which he attained at this time, all unconscious of it himself, made her feel
that indeed his prayers had been heard, and that the fiery furnace through
which he had been passing had but purified the gold, and that the Master's own
image was being reflected in the molten, quivering metal. To others, also, this
was equally apparent. Mrs. Beecher, speaking of the last association which he
attended in the Bassein District, said that she felt borne to heaven on Mr.
Vinton's prayers. Gen. Bell said to his wife one day, "How rapidly that dear
man of God seems growing in grace lately."</p>
<p>The last prayer-meeting he attended was at the house of this old and tried
friend, who, commander-in-chief of all the English forces in British Burmah,
was at the same time a humble Christian, and an earnest student of God's word.
An English lady who was present at this meeting says,--</p>
<blockquote>"We can never forget Mr. Vinton's words that night. He seemed to
have had a glimpse into the hidden things of God; and instead of going on with
the study of the chapter, as we were in the habit of doing, we sat spellbound,
listening to his burning words. As he spoke of the bliss of heaven, his face
seemed to brighten and glow with an unearthly light; and, as we knelt with him
in prayer, we felt awed by the way in which he seemed to talk with God face to
face. How little we thought, that, in one short week, he would be standing in
the inner sanctuary, in the presence of his risen Lord!"</blockquote>
<p>He had just returned from his last journey when he attended the meeting
referred to. News had come from the mountains west of Shway Gyeen, that scores
of villages were ready to receive the gospel. The region was one so difficult
of access that it had never been reached by missionary effort; and this
awakening was the result of the conversion of a few young men who had heard the
gospel on the plains, and had gone back to their friends to tell the story they
had heard. Mr. Vinton selected six young men who were ready to go into that
unhealthy region in order to proclaim the unsearchable riches of Christ; but,
that they should be properly located, it was necessary that he should go
himself, survey the field, and select the most available points for the
location of native preachers. Only scanty records have come down to us from
this journey, though in after years it bore abundant fruits. There was
opportunity, after the journey began, to send back two brief letters, and from
these we make the following extracts:--</p>
<blockquote>"From Nau-toh's to Kyouk-pong, I walked nearly the whole way, as
the pony's back was sore. I stopped at a great number of villages on the way,
and preached myself hoarse. I arrived just as the gong was about to ring, jaded
and tired, and yet preached a long sermon. The people were very attentive. A
cloud is gathering; and, judging from my feelings, there will be rain. Oh, may
it be long and abundant! Pray, my dear wife, not so much that God will watch
over me, as that he will go with me by his Spirit; for without that I might as
well be dead as alive.<br>
<br>
"Oh for the baptism of the Holy Ghost, such as the apostles had to prepare them
for their great work!<br>
<br>
"I have been invariably well, and mostly happy, since I left. But for this
'body of death,' which drags down my poor soul, and makes it so earthly and
grovelling in its aspirations, so unlike the heavenly, I should be perfectly
so. I have had some precious seasons, in which the spirit has triumphed over
the flesh; and I have been brought into goodly fellowship with my precious
Saviour, and I have cared for nothing in the world but to be a herald of mercy
to the perishing. Pray, dear wife, that God may strip me for the race, and
harness me for the battle. I long for nothing so much as for more power in
prayer. I would be a wrestling Jacob, and a prevailing Israel. I want an
increase of power to preach the word in the demonstration of the Spirit, and
with power."</blockquote>
<p>He returned to Rangoon on the 24th of March, 1858, in apparent health,
complaining only of being "very tired." That evening he attended the
Bible-reading at Gen. Bell's, to which reference has been made.</p>
<p>The next day it appeared that he was ill, but he still kept about the work
which had accumulated during his absence. On Saturday fever set in; and Dr.
Dickinson, his faithful physician for many years, was summoned. No one,
however, anticipated that it would prove to be more than a slight attack of
jungle fever.</p>
<p>He talked with all the natives who came in, and transacted the necessary
business connected with the mission as he lay on his bed, ever cheerful,
rallying his wife on her unceasing anxiety about him, telling her how good
every thing tasted that she brought him, and laying many a plan for future work
and future usefulness.</p>
<p>On Monday he was too ill to see any one; but on Tuesday the fever left him,
and the doctor pronounced him out of danger. Tuesday night there was a change.
The doctor was hastily summoned. It was evident at once to him that the disease
had assumed a grave form. He used all the means that his long experience could
suggest; but by nine o'clock, so rapid had been the progress of the disease, he
left the bedside, saying, "I can do no more! He can live but a few hours."</p>
<p>It had not needed these words to assure Mrs. Vinton that the costliest
sacrifice she could offer was now to be laid upon God's altar. The closing
scene can only be described in the words of this devoted wife; and we give
entire the letter in which the news of their father's death is communicated to
the son and daughter.</p>
<blockquote>"DEAR, DEAR CHILDREN,--You seldom write to me about your religious
feelings. Is your love to God increasing, or diminishing? This you can
ascertain by asking yourselves whether you possess any thing too dear to give
back to God, the Author of all our mercies. I know that you love your parents.
Do you love them so much that you would be loath to part with them if God
calls?<br>
<br>
"Three sabbaths ago I was in the south-east room reading my Bible, and feeling
very happy in my mind. I knelt down to pray; and in my prayer I renewed my
covenant with God, and distinctly surrendered myself, soul, body, time,
influence, children, and <i>husband</i>, to the Lord; and I felt so hearty and
happy in doing it! In a moment something seemed to ask me if God should accept
of this surrender, and should take any one of these things, whether I would
heartily resign it without a murmur? I shuddered at the thought, and sank back,
and was about to rise from my knees, but shuddered still more at my feelings. I
spoke out aloud, 'Have I been so long a time a professor of religion, and have
I any thing too dear to give to God? No, Lord!' And I burst into tears, and
exclaimed, 'No, Lord: I am honest in my surrender. I resign every thing and
every one.'<br>
<br>
"I felt fully assured from that time that God was about to make a requirement.
What, I did not know. Sometimes I thought it would be one of you. I made up my
mind that the cords which bound me to earth were about to be sundered. During
the week, from day to day, I used to go to my closet to cast my cares upon
Jesus; and oh, what precious seasons I spent there!<br>
<br>
"Every thing about the mission work, about your father, who was then absent
upon the mountains west of Shway Gyeen, every thing about you two, or about
your return, I carried there, and left quietly. Sometimes, on coming away, I
said to myself, 'Why have I for these many years been groaning under my cares,
when it is so easy to lay them at the feet of a loving Saviour?'<br>
<br>
"Soon your father returned, having been absent about a month. He was not quite
well; but he would not say he was ill, only 'very tired and worn out with the
long journey on the elephant.'<br>
<br>
"The next day he was more languid, and his flesh hotter; but he had been gone
so long, that there was a world of business to be attended to, and the natives
were around him all day. In the evening we attended the meeting at Gen. Bell's.
Your father led, and I am sure some of his remarks about the bliss of heaven
will never be forgotten by those present.<br>
<br>
"The next morning he felt worse, but still he worked all day. Friday he
consented to take some medicine, and kept his bed. He had asked an engineer to
give him some advice about the new shingle roof for Frank's Chapel; but toward
evening he said he could not walk over, and I must go. I made ready; but, when
Capt. Newmarch came, he went over, and stood talking nearly an hour.<br>
<br>
"He had a bad night, and early Saturday morning I sent for the doctor. I went
into my closet with this new care to cast at Jesus' feet; but alas! as soon as
I knelt down, and asked God to restore your dear father to health, something
seemed to ask me, 'Do you remember your laying <i>all</i> upon God's altar? God
has accepted the offering, and is now going to take it to himself.' I tried to
pray, but could not, and left the room in anguish, fully knowing that a
dreadful blow was pending, and yet not daring to murmur, or say, 'Why doest
thou so?'<br>
<br>
"On Monday he was so much worse that the doctor forbade any one seeing him but
myself and Mary Brayton. Tuesday the fever left him; but just at night
dysentery set in, and at nine o'clock the doctor left his bedside, saying he
could do no more for him, and that probably he would not live two hours; but he
did survive until seven o'clock Wednesday morning, March 31.<br>
<br>
"One thing was very remarkable, that he suffered so little during his short
illness. I asked him very frequently if he had a headache, or pain anywhere
(such as usually accompanies fever); but he invariably said 'No:' and the
doctor assured me he was right,--that there was no feeling but that of weakness
and languor. Those who saw him pass away, and then looked upon the corpse,
exclaimed, 'This is not death!' No, dear children, do not ever say that your
father is dead. He is only gone into the inner sanctuary, to perform a higher
and a nobler work than travelling in the Karen jungles.<br>
<br>
"You must feel that if you are not descended from the titled ancestry of earth,
you are the children of a <i>man of God, passed into the skies</i>. Few
children ever had such a father. Oh, strive to be just like him!<br>
<br>
"You know how he was beloved, and all but worshipped, throughout the Karen
jungles. Some seem to think that it almost amounted to idolatry, and that it
was necessary to take him away that the churches might look more directly to
God; but he was as much beloved and respected, yea, venerated, by the English
community.<br>
<br>
"The funeral was attended this morning by all the missionaries, and all the
officers, civil and military. Every one feels the dreadful blow, and some go so
far as to predict the utter ruin of the whole mission; but not so. <i>God is
not dead!</i> He knew what he was doing in taking away the holiest and
hardest-working missionary from the field; and I think he will now pour out his
Spirit, and carry on the work more powerfully than ever before.<br>
<br>
"The cause was dear to your father, <i>very dear</i>; but it is much dearer to
the Saviour. Prepare to come out with his mantle upon you.<br>
<br>
"The day before your father fell asleep he asked if I had written to you. I
said 'No: I cannot get time to write this mail.' He said, 'You must write, and
assure them that I am not very ill. I fear some one may write, and that they
will worry about me, and think that I shall die.'<br>
<br>
"After the doctor gave him up, I wanted to tell him that he might not live, and
ask him for some directions for the future; but the friends who stood by would
not consent. They could not believe that he was going to die, and thought it
would alarm him unnecessarily. All that I could do was to say to him,--<br>
<br>
"'My dear, this is a dying world. In the event of any thing happening to either
of us, what would be your wish with regard to the children?' He answered, 'To
have them complete their studies, and come out and take our places.'<br>
<br>
"'But if we should both die, what about Calista? Would you think it best for
her to come if we are not here?'<br>
<br>
"'Oh, yes! Tell, her not to fear, but to trust God: he will take care of
her.'<br>
<br>
"At another time I leaned over the bedside and said, 'Dear, how do you feel
now? Shall we together see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living?'
He looked up so pleasantly, and said, 'Yes!'<br>
<br>
"'Have we long years of usefulness before us?'<br>
<br>
"'Yes! Oh, yes!'<br>
<br>
"Mr. Brayton, who was watching with him, said decidedly, 'I <i>cannot</i> think
brother Vinton's work is done yet.'<br>
<br>
"Not a quarter of an hour before he died, the doctor asked him how he felt. He
answered, 'A little stronger.' I do not think he thought of dying until he
opened his eyes in glory."</blockquote>
<p>What more fitting close to a shining life like his, than to be translated
thus suddenly from the battle-field to the presence of the Lord; to die, as he
had lived, "with the harness on;" to close his "tired" eyes, thinking only of a
brief rest ere he went forth to the conflict again, and to open them in the</p>
<pre>
"City of the pearl-bright portal,
City of the jasper wall,
City of the golden pavement,
Seat of endless festival"!
</pre>
<p>What mattered it that there was no opportunity for dying testimony, for a
last good-by to the faithful wife, or tender messages to the absent children?
His life and labors had been one continual testimony; and to the mourning wife
and children there was the less need of loving farewell messages, since, in all
the long past, there had not been one bitter word which needed now to be
unsaid.</p>
<p>There was a hush in the room as the spirit took its flight; and then an awe
came down upon those who stood by, as they beheld the mysterious
transfiguration that sometimes comes after death. As they saw a glad smile
creep over the sleeping face, they felt that in some inexplicable way the
happy, glorified spirit had been enabled to whisper to its other self something
of the unutterable glories of the world beyond. The soul that had so long
panted for more holiness, and greater conformity to the divine image, was at
last satisfied, because it had "awakened in His likeness."</p>
<p>We cannot explain the unwillingness of Mr. Vinton's friends to believe that
he was about to die, even after the doctor had given him up, except that they
all loved him so, and felt that he was doing such a great work, and that he was
so necessary to it, that it was impossible that God could be about to take him
away. He had gone in and out before them for so many years, a tower of
strength, that they seem to have imagined that he could not die.</p>
<p>Mr. Rose said, in his address at the funeral,--</p>
<blockquote>"Is it possible that Mr. Vinton is dead,--our friend and brother,
esteemed and beloved as a devoted and honored servant of God? Shall we see his
familiar face and hear his friendly voice no more?<br>
<br>
"I confess I find it difficult to realize this. Nay, I cannot realize it. I
have never felt such a strong propensity in my mind to reject the evidence of
my own senses as in this case. There is something within, stronger than an
ordinary unbelief, that sternly refuses to admit as true what my own eyes have
seen.<br>
<br>
"When I first saw the icy hand of death laid upon his countenance, I felt, for
the moment, as if God had made a mistake. I felt as if the Angel of Death had
been misdirected. I felt that Mr. Vinton's time had not yet come, that his work
was not yet done; for though he had labored among this people for twenty-four
years, and though his labors have been blessed and honored of God as the labors
of but few men have been, yet it seemed to me the great amount of good he had
been enabled, through divine help, to accomplish, was a pledge of his still
more abundant labors, of success still more heart-cheering and glorious.<br>
<br>
"He walked among us in the midst of his years, in the dignity of undiminished
strength and ripened manhood, presenting before us a spectacle morally
beautiful and noble. All the powers of his manhood were consecrated to the
highest interests of men. In the emphatic command, 'Go ye into all the world,
and preach the gospel to every creature,' he heard the voice of Jesus speaking
to him; and confiding without a doubt in the promise, 'Lo! I am with you
always,' he came to these ends of the earth, and went through these provinces
of Burmah, from village to village, and from town to town, in season and out of
season, bearing precious seed, even the uncorruptible word of God, which liveth
and abideth forever.<br>
<br>
"God was with him; for his language was, 'Send me not except thou go with me.'
Christ was with him, for he felt that without him he could do nothing; and what
has been the result? His spiritual children are now numbered by scores of
thousands. Many, who had received the life-giving words from his lips, have
gone to heaven before him, and many more are now on the way.<br>
<br>
"As I follow the soul of our departed brother up to the world of bliss, I see,
with a vision stronger and more true than that of the natural eye, companies of
redeemed Karens, radiant in robes of light, with harps of gold, coming forth to
give the first greeting, saying, 'O teacher, teacher! have you come? Welcome!
welcome!' I can hear them say, 'Teacher, but for you, we had never come here.
You showed us the way of eternal life. You led us to Jesus. You taught us how
to pray, and here we are redeemed and glorified.'<br>
<br>
"Mr. Vinton's aim was something higher and nobler than to establish a mere
nominal Christianity. It was to win souls to Christ, to bring men practically
and experimentally to the knowledge of repentance toward God, and faith in the
Lord Jesus Christ, resulting in holiness of heart and life."</blockquote>
<p>These are the words of a brother missionary, one who had known him
intimately for years; and it was a common saying, that to know Mr. Vinton was
to love him.</p>
<p>The following tribute appeared in "The Christian Secretary:"--</p>
<blockquote>"Justus H. Vinton is dead. The toils and labors of the devoted
missionary are ended, and he has gone up to receive his reward. For nearly a
quarter of a century brother Vinton labored with unflagging faith and devoted
zeal in the cause of his Master. No obstacle was powerful enough to discourage
him in his labor of love. No adverse circumstance could for a moment delay him
in the work which he had evidently been called to do.<br>
<br>
"In storms and sunshine, in prosperity and in adversity, brother Vinton was
still the same. Earnestly devoted to his Master's service, blessed with an iron
constitution, an indomitable will, and unwavering faith in the promises, his
whole missionary life was a glowing example of a devoted disciple, earnestly
engaged in his Master's vineyard,<br>
<br>
"Nor were his labors unblessed. No missionary could point to as many converts,
as the seals of his ministry, as Justus H. Vinton.<br>
<br>
"There will be no more misunderstandings with regard to the 'policy' of brother
Vinton. He may have made mistakes in the course of his long missionary career.
It would be surprising if he had not; but they were errors of the head, and not
of the heart. Whatever they may have been, or however he may have been
misunderstood in this country, he was always honest in his dealings with his
fellow-men.<br>
<br>
"He is beyond the reach of criticism now, and we are sure that no one will feel
disposed to indulge in it. As a Christian and a missionary, his name will be
held in cherished remembrance by thousands of his friends in this country, as
well as in India, and future generations will rise up to call him
blessed."</blockquote>
<p>No more fitting close to this memoir can be found than the closing sentences
of the letter written by Mr. Vinton to the Baptist churches of Connecticut just
before leaving for his last journey, and which was found among his papers after
his death.</p>
<blockquote>"Here, then, is the great subject-matter of my letter. You have
helped us with your contributions of money most liberally, and we pray God to
reward you a thousand-fold. But what avails this, so long as these precious
souls are not converted? and <i>this</i> never can be, without more wrestling,
agonizing prayer to God. Were it possible that prevailing prayer could be
offered unaccompanied by alms, and could we have but one, I would
unhesitatingly say, '<i>Leave us, if need be, to starve</i>, but give us of
your prayers, that the work of saving souls may go on.' And yet I know that no
man can offer prevailing prayer who does not lie as a living or dying sacrifice
upon God's altar, without stipulation, condition, or reserve.<br>
<br>
"Oh, what a precious privilege! <i>Every thing</i> upon that altar--our bodies,
our souls, our children, our property, our influence, our ALL! What an
inheritance for our children!<br>
<br>
"Brethren and sisters, I earnestly entreat you to meet us before that altar
upon which our earthly all shall have been deposited, that we may there become
wrestling Jacobs and prevailing Israels upon behalf of priceless souls,--that
we may indeed travail in birth for souls till 'Christ be formed in them the
hope of glory.'<br>
<br>
"Affectionately yours,<br>
<br>
"J. H. VlNTON."</blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<pre>
"This earth has lost its power to drag me downward;
    Its spell is gone:
My course is now right upward and right onward,
    To yonder throne."
</pre>
<p>The sad story was whispered from one weeping Karen to another. The pastors
told it to their people with broken utterances. Little companies of Karens went
from village to village, not, as six years before, to carry the glad news that
the deliverer had come, but with the heavy tidings that the best earthly friend
the Karens had ever had was gone from them forever. Large companies came down
to the city, stunned with the news, and anxious, not only to learn from the
mamma's own lips the confirmation of the sad report, but to mingle their tears
with hers, to look into the vacant study, so filled with tender associations to
many of them, and to gaze on the grave of one whom they had loved only too
well.</p>
<p>It was touching to see some of them steal off to his study, and pass their
hands caressingly over the quaint old-fashioned chair he always sat in, and
over the papers which lay on the desk still undisturbed, as if in the hard
rough outlines of the wood, and in the rustling paper, there must be some
lingering memory of the busy hands which were now forever at rest. Though
crushed at first by the suddenness of the blow, yet they had been too long
under the influence of that hopeful, trusting spirit, to doubt that the Lord,
who had raised them up such a leader and helper in the darkest hour of their
need, would still be their support and stay in this heavy affliction. Thousands
of prayers went up from that smitten flock for the bereaved widow, for the
fatherless children so far away, and for themselves, that the Great Shepherd
might now lead them, and teach them to depend more wholly upon him.</p>
<p>Deputations of native pastors came to beg Mrs. Vinton not to leave them to
return to her home in America, but to remain and to take up her husband's work,
and to go before them as he had done.</p>
<p>Go home to America! Yes: it would have been sweet to go back to the dear old
homestead where her childhood had been spent, and where an aged mother still
longed for one more sight of the absent daughter. Fond sisters and a loving
brother would have vied with each other in making her last years happy and
restful; and, more than all, her two children were in America; and who could
have blamed her if she had turned her steps hitherward, and, contenting herself
with twenty-four years of active, ceaseless service for the heathen, had spent
the last six years of her life in the retirement of her home, and in the
enjoyment of the society of the host of friends who stood ready to welcome her
to these shores?</p>
<p>Doubtless the home of her childhood, with its many tender memories, never
appeared more peaceful and inviting, with its low-browed roof and quaint New
England surroundings,--the orchard, the chestnut-wood, and the whispering
pines, where had been her bower of prayer; doubtless the claims of the aged
mother, the widowed sister, and her own fatherless children, never appealed so
strongly to her heart; but clear and distinct above these came the call from
the Karen churches, the entreaties of the native Christians, the cry of the
ignorant and perishing all around. We cannot be surprised that she resolutely
endeavored to put aside her own grief, and sense of loss, and began to
strengthen the hearts of the pastors with words of encouragement, and to
comfort the weeping disciples with the assurance, that, so long as she lived,
she would remain with them, and labor on as before.</p>
<p>Great grace and power seemed to come upon her from on high, as if to prepare
her for the lonely, toilsome path before her. Dr. Kincaid, the old and tried
friend, concerning whom the Vintons had so often occasion to use the language
of Proverbs xvii. 17, and Philippians i. 3, came at once from Prome to Rangoon,
and, by his judicious counsel and hearty co-operation, very much aided Mrs.
Vinton and the native pastors in arranging plans of work for the future. Not
content with this, he went out among the people to assure them that the mamma
would not leave them, and that, whenever they needed <i>his</i> presence or
assistance, he would come at once, and help them in any way that he could.
These were no "idle words." Eugenio Kincaid was a man of deeds, large-hearted,
and self-sacrificing; and many a time, during the next six years, did he leave
his field, and come to Rangoon to aid Mrs. Vinton by his counsel, in carrying
on a work under which many a pastor in this country would have staggered.</p>
<p>Never was a Burman missionary so loved and trusted by the Karens as Dr.
Kincaid. Like the dear teacher who had just gone from them, he had shown that
he sought "not theirs, but them." Fearless and independent, while trusting and
humble, he read in his commission, "Preach the gospel to every creature;" and
whether, in his journeys among the Burmans, he came across a Karen hamlet or a
garrison of English soldiers, he never refrained from preaching Christ to them,
because he had not been specially "designated" to them. His work was owned and
blessed of God; and, besides the many trophies won from among the Burmans, he
will meet in heaven hundreds of redeemed Karens who first heard the gospel from
his lips, besides many others who were cheered and helped by his earnest words
and example. Dear, noble, old man!--the hero of a hundred fights,--his
indomitable courage never failed him, whether facing the robbers in northern
Burmah, or the governor of Rangoon with his infuriated soldiery, or the terrors
of an ecclesiastical council in Maulmain. Right was right, and duty was duty;
and his voice was always heard on the side of truth.</p>
<p>While we write these lines, news comes from his far-off western home that he
lies very ill, possibly at the point of death.</p>
<p>God grant that this may not be true! May that brave, true heart beat for
many a year yet! The flashing eye which so often made the cruel oppressor quail
beneath its gaze is dimmed with age. The arm which has dealt so many true blows
for God and right is weak and trembling with infirmity. But may God grant to
make the walk home, in the hush of evening, a calm and restful one; and as the
twilight deepens, and the forms of earth are lost in the gathering darkness,
may the lights of home shine out all the clearer! May He who has said, "I will
never leave thee nor forsake thee," place around him the "Everlasting Arms"!
and may this man of God share in the quiet trust expressed in the lines of
Bonar:--</p>
<pre>
"I am wandering down life's shady path,--
    Slowly, slowly, wandering down:
I am wandering down life's rugged path,--
    Slowly, slowly, wandering down.

'Tis the mellow flush of sunset now,
    'Tis the shadow and the cloud;
'Tis the dimness of the dying eve,
    'Tis the shadow and the cloud.

'Tis the dreamy haze of twilight now,
    'Tis the hour of silent trust;
'Tis the solemn hue of fading skies,
    'Tis the time of tranquil trust.

We have shared our earthly sorrows
    Each with the other here;
We shall share our heavenly gladness
    Each with the other there.

We have mingled tears together,
    We shall mingle smiles and song;
We have mingled sighs together,
    We shall mingle smiles and song."
</pre>
<p>No one on that heavenly shore will be more glad to greet Eugenio Kincaid
than his old comrade on the mission field. They had toiled together side by
side for years; together they had won many a victory over the powers of hell;
and together shall they, with that other grand old veteran, Jabez Swan, walk
the golden streets, and thank God for permitting them to do and to suffer for
his cause.</p>
<p>The burden of the churches thus thrown upon Mrs. Vinton, made it necessary
that she should commit a large portion of the school-work to assistants; and
here she began to reap the fruits of the care and wisdom with which the
educational work of previous years had been conducted.</p>
<p>In the Normal School in Maulmain, which in the midst of its greatest promise
came to such an untimely end, had been two Karen girls who had been named by
friends in America, Fidelia and Eliza. They had profited, during the short time
they had been in the Normal School, by the instructions of Miranda Vinton and
Miss Wright, who were in charge.</p>
<p>These two girls Mrs. Vinton called to her assistance, and they soon
developed into teachers of marked ability. They differed widely in disposition
and temperament, each in a sense the complement of the other, yet, both by
disposition and long friendship, fitted to work successfully together. They had
married men in every way worthy of them. Eliza's husband, Rev. Thah-mway, has
been for more than twenty-five years a most devoted and efficient preacher and
teacher, for the greater portion of the time being an ordained pastor, in
charge of a large district of native churches; not only directing with
admirable skill the unordained pastors and assistants under his charge, but
also doing splendid service as an evangelist.</p>
<p>Fidelia's husband, Nyo-poh, was, until his death, employed as a teacher; for
a long time in the city school, of which he was treasurer. He was a most
faithful and trustworthy man, and wholly worthy of the implicit confidence with
which he was regarded by the missionaries. The assistance of these teachers
left Mrs. Vinton more time to devote to the necessary oversight of the
churches. It has never been fully understood in this country that a large share
of the personal work of a missionary is devoted to this task of oversight.
Constituted as the majority of the churches are, at least in the first or
second generation of mission labor, of converts who are either entirely
uneducated, or but partially trained, and embarrassed by the remnants of
heathen superstitions and customs, they would need the very best of pastors;
but to supply this need we have only the ranks of the converts themselves from
which to draw. This difficulty has led to a system of oversight and advice upon
the part of the missionaries, which demands much time, and is the source of
great anxiety.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in our older missions in Burmah, the necessity for such work is
passing away with the introduction of a thoroughly trained native ministry; and
each generation of effort leaves the missionary more free for personal labor
among the heathen. However, with the formation of new churches in heathen
districts, arises again the necessity for advice from the missionary, and the
same process is repeated. We long for the day when the supply of native
preachers from the old fields will not only meet the demands of the old
churches, but will furnish a sufficient <i>corps</i> of native missionaries to
meet the wants of the new fields opening on every side.</p>
<p>It is but right and fair to the missionaries to say that they confine
themselves to <i>advice</i>. They never attempt to exercise any disciplinary
authority, or to become in any sense "Lords over God's heritage." Their desire
is to train the natives so that as quickly as possible they may be qualified to
direct their own church affairs.</p>
<p>In this work of oversight Mrs. Vinton was greatly assisted by the three
ordained pastors, Mau-Yay, Nga-lay, and Yai-pau, and by others equally
faithful, but not so prominent. It seemed as if special grace was given to the
pastors in this emergency; for never before, even in the brightest days of the
mission, had there been such a display of faithfulness and zeal as now. Nor was
it alone among the pastors that Mrs. Vinton found hearty and efficient
supporters.</p>
<p>Loonee-pa and Myat-tway, who, with their sons, were engaged in business in
Rangoon, and were living on the mission premises, stood ready to render all
assistance in their power in the conduct of the temporal affairs of the
mission. The donations of these two families were on a scale which would put to
shame many a one who, in this country, has won the praise of his brethren for
liberality.</p>
<p>Others, of less means, were equally generous. It is impossible to convey any
adequate idea of the readiness of the Karens to do any thing, or give any
thing, which might help Mrs. Vinton or further the interests of the mission.
Truly the example of self-sacrifice set them by their departed teacher had not
been lost, and its influence is felt in that mission until to-day. Even the
pupils in the schools participated in this feeling. The "Revenue Survey," which
was the basis of the assessment of taxes, had furnished employment to many of
the young men of Mrs. Vinton's school during their vacations. Their work was
invariably so well done, that a young man had but to present a certificate of
proficiency from her, and he secured an appointment at once. From the pay which
the pupils, thus employed, received for their work, they set apart a tenth, a
fifth, or sometimes even a half, as a contribution to the mission. Their
donations were so large in proportion to their means, that Mrs. Vinton felt
compelled to remonstrate with them for giving so much. The tears would start to
their eyes as they answered earnestly, "We <i>cannot</i> give too much. If it
had not been for you and your instructions, we should never have known enough
to have earned this money. Take it and use it, so that others coming, as
ignorant as we were, may be taught as well as we have been."</p>
<p>Nor were the churches behindhand in the same liberal spirit. Numbers of
young men who had been educated in Mrs. Vinton's school refused lucrative
appointments under the English government, and offered their services as
evangelists and teachers. The effect of all this upon Mrs. Vinton herself was
remarkable. She had always been burdened with a desponding spirit, and an
inclination to look upon the "dark side." She had fought against it earnestly;
and, so long as her husband lived, his sunny, hopeful disposition had assisted
her in conquering it. When he died, it seemed as if she inherited the calm
trustfulness and confidence which had been such a marked trait in his
character. The wonderful exhibitions of self-denial and sacrifice presented by
the Karens strengthened this spirit, and never again do we find in her letters
that tone of despondency which was frequently to be discovered in her earlier
communications.</p>
<p>In addition, she was much cheered and strengthened by the remembrance of a
remarkable dream which she had previous to her husband's death.</p>
<p>She had gone to sleep with her mind full of anxious forebodings caused by
the action of the deputation. It seemed to her as if there was nothing left for
them to do but to relinquish the mission, and either bury themselves in the
trackless wildernesses of Karennee, or, worse than this, to return to
America.</p>
<p>She dreamed that she stood before a mighty tree, shapely and beautiful, with
wide-spreading branches. While she stood gazing at it, a party of men came, and
with stern determination attacked the noble trunk with axes, saying to each
other "Let us cut it down!" The work of destruction went on, until the trunk
was nearly severed, when all save one withdrew, and stood at a little distance
to watch its fall. The last few strokes were given, and the trunk was severed;
but, to the astonishment of the lookers-on (and of the dreamer), the tree did
not fall. While she was wondering at this, and looking upward, a voice came,
"<i>The tree is rooted in the skies. It cannot fall. It is rooted in the
skies;</i>" and then she saw that the upper branches were buried in the
clouds.</p>
<p>She awoke; and, as she thought it over, the impression grew upon her that
the dream was indeed sent of God; and ever after, when difficulties threatening
the permanence of the mission would arise, she comforted herself with these
words, "It is rooted in the skies. It cannot fall. It is rooted in the
skies."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<pre>
"Go labor on: enough while here
    If He shall praise thee, if He deign
Thy willing heart to mark and cheer;
    No toil for Him shall be in vain."
</pre>
<p>So soon as the news of Mr. Vinton's death reached America, Calista, who was
just about to graduate at Suffield, prepared to return to Burmah. The churches
in Connecticut, who had so often and so liberally contributed to the Vintons,
secured her passage and outfit; and on Christmas Day, 1858, the mother and
daughter were re-united. Calista engaged at once in the school work, taking
charge of the classes in mathematics, and giving instruction in vocal music,
besides assisting her mother in the care of the boarding department.</p>
<p>It is not to be wondered at, however, that Mrs. Vinton often trembled as she
looked forward to the future, feeling that the success or failure of the
mission depended largely upon the wisdom and skill with which she directed its
affairs. She had always been a woman of much prayer; but she now emphatically
gave herself to supplication and prayer that God would guide her and the native
pastors, and pour out his Spirit on the churches, and thus, by his presence and
special blessing, make up for the loss of their devoted and faithful leader.
Mrs. Vinton did not relinquish any of the branches of the work in which she had
previously engaged, but carried on all the different departments of it which
had hitherto devolved upon both herself and her husband. The only change she
made was, that in the dry season she committed the charge of the school to the
native assistants, and spent her time among the village churches. This was the
more easily done, as the school at that portion of the year consisted mainly of
the younger scholars, the older ones having returned to their homes to assist
their parents in the harvesting of the rice-crop.</p>
<p>By the large Karen population scattered through the jungles north and west
of Rangoon, she was welcomed with a heartiness and enthusiasm which few
missionaries have experienced. Wherever she went, the people came to her in
throngs. She was often aroused in the morning by the creaking of the bamboo
flooring under the cautious step of early callers, who were saying to each
other in loud whispers, "Isn't the mamma awake yet?" Often it would be midnight
ere the last lingering visitor left. The efforts of the people to show
themselves hospitable, and to render her visits as pleasant as possible, were
most assiduous. As soon as the news was brought to a village that she had
reached the landing-place at the river, perhaps three or four miles away,
buffalo-carts were despatched at once to bring her and her baggage to the
chapel. Much care was bestowed on the selection of the buffaloes, and the
quietest pair in the neighborhood was promoted to the post of honor. Sometimes
when the carts reached the landing-place, Mrs. Vinton would be greeted with the
laughing assurance, "Come, mamma, you have nothing to fear: these are Christian
buffaloes." But at other times it would be, "Take care, mamma: these are
heathen buffaloes;" and the event often tried her powers of holding on and
holding together to the utmost. The strange antipathy of these creatures to
white people has never been accounted for satisfactorily. It is in some way
connected with the sense of smell; for a whole herd will gaze quietly upon a
white person for a time, but, just as soon as he goes to windward of them, they
begin to manifest great uneasiness. The massive heads are thrown up; and the
animals sniff the air with evident alarm, not unmixed with anger. In another
moment the entire herd breaks into a run, in whatever direction the heads
happen to be turned.</p>
<p>Some experienced old wiseacres have learned to connect the odor with the
individual, and will rush at a white person wherever seen; but, as a rule, the
mere presence of a white man does not awaken alarm if he keeps to leeward of
the animals.</p>
<p>Woe be to a poor missionary who has deftly crawled into the cart to which a
pair of these powerful creatures have been harnessed. Before he has fairly
crouched down in the straw, fondly imagining, that, if he can keep out of
sight, all will be well, he is convinced of his mistake by a series of snorts
and plunges; and then the infuriated beasts set off upon a dead run across the
uneven paddy-fields, taking ditches, bushes, and embankments in their way with
the utmost <i>abandon</i>. Frantically the poor passenger clutches at the sides
of the cart, in the vain attempt to keep himself from being bumped to a jelly
as the springless vehicle bounces over the rough ground. The straw, intended to
serve as cushions, glides out from under him in the most inconsiderate manner,
and gathers itself up into an indignant lump at the other side of the cart.</p>
<p>The basket of dishes suddenly makes a lunge, and hits him cruelly in the
back. Then an ant-hill under one wheel upsets the basket of cooking utensils;
and pots, pans, and kettles come flying at him from all sides, some landing on
the ground, to be picked up by the boatmen as they come along. Still the
buffaloes keep right on, never slacking their pace for bruised body or broken
dishes: their faces are set toward home, and they will not rest until they are
brought up, breathless and panting, against some strong buffalo-pen in the
village.</p>
<p>On one occasion Mrs. Vinton found one of these uncomfortable rides brought
to a more sudden termination than even she had expected. The buffaloes had made
a sudden turn, and were dashing through a grove of trees, when one of the solid
wooden wheels of the cart came against a stump. The pole broke; and away the
frantic creatures galloped into the depths of the jungle, not to be found again
until the next day. The village was far away; and the catastrophe would have
been solemn, had it not been enlivened by the actions of the "Kalah cook." His
chief anxiety had been for the dishes and other household utensils, which he
had carefully transferred from the boat to the cart, after which he had seated
himself among his "household goods," prepared to enjoy the long ride to the
village. When the buffaloes began to run away, he clutched frantically at the
basket of dishes, and tried to steady with his feet the other basket containing
the precious little store of tea, coffee, sugar, bread, butter, lard,
curry-powder, pickles, flour, medicines, and spices, beside other necessary
things not to be found short of the city bazaar. But alas! as the cart swayed
from side to side, and jumped up and down, one thing after another broke loose
from its moorings, and he soon found his hands (and his <i>lap</i> too)
literally full. His despairing looks and gestures, his brief ejaculations as
one dish after another broke, and other treasures were landed in the road, were
most amusing. He had an evident determination to "stick to his post," but the
trouble seemed to be to find the post. He cast agonizing glances over the side
of the cart as it danced along: the desire was strong within him at times to
seize a basket and jump with it to the ground, but prudence forbade. Mrs.
Vinton and her good Nau-oo-thah found their attention happily diverted from
their own suffering and bruised condition, as they watched the comical actions
of the man; and they laughed until the tears came. After the "smash-up" he
looked very rueful as they proceeded to gather up the fragments and place them
in the baskets, while they waited for another cart to come for them from the
village.</p>
<p>The "Kalah cook," while very useful in his own department, and forming a
necessary adjunct to every travelling party, does not seem gifted with many
ideas beyond the work of preparing meals, and keeping out of the way of the
boatmen, who look upon him as a mild sort of intruder.</p>
<p>Once, when Mr. Luther was travelling, the boat grounded on a sand-bar. The
boatmen immediately sprang overboard, and began shoving it back into deep
water. It was hard work, as the tide was rapidly falling; but, as they paused a
moment to take breath, they spied the cook sitting in the bottom of the boat,
<i>pushing against one of the thwarts</i> with all his strength.</p>
<p>This grave attempt to aid in releasing the boat from the sand-bar was too
much for the Karens; and they sat down in the shallow water and laughed and
screamed to their heart's content, while the poor cook gazed at them in
bewildered astonishment. He had never heard of trying to lift one's self over a
fence by pulling at his boot-straps, for he wore no boots: therefore the
similarity of his attempt to this time-worn problem did not strike him.</p>
<p>The "Kalah cook," however, is in his element when he has once been safely
landed, with his belongings, at the native village. The boatmen despised him
and his finiking ways, and hooted at him when he suggested to one of them to go
ashore after a chatty of well-water for culinary purposes, instead of dipping
it up out of the river. Here, however, at the village the people gaze on him
with a mixed amazement at the blackness of his skin, the whiteness of his
garments, and the general "queerness" of his methods of cooking. He receives
all offers of assistance with becoming dignity, taking the stray bundles of dry
twigs brought him by the little urchins, with only a nod; directing, by a
lordly gesture, where the women shall place the chatties of water brought from
the well; and, if unable to find a place sufficiently sheltered for his
cooking, making signs for thatch and bamboo to make a screen for his fire, and
thus shelter it from the wind.</p>
<p>He builds his fire on the ground under some native house, or perchance a
tree; and unmoved by the concentrated stare of some dozen or more naked
children (who dare not venture into the chapel where the mamma is, because of a
rumor that she has threatened to <i>whip</i> all naked children), he proceeds
with his cooking. His features relax a little when a dozen of eggs is brought
in; but when a basket of sweet, freshly-hulled rice comes, and with it a fat
hen or duck for the mamma's dinner, he actually smiles, and exclaims,
"Koungthai!" (good); for the Kalah cook generally has a smattering of English
and Burmese, and the latter is his only means of communication with the Karens.
But we must leave him to concoct a most savory dinner with the few and rude
cooking appliances at his hand,--a sauce-pan and a fire kindled between three
lumps of clay,--while we turn to the missionary and describe her reception.</p>
<p>Such of the villagers as are not at work in the paddy-fields are busy in
arranging her lodging and living room in the village chapel. Her roll of
bedding, tied up carefully in matting, is unfastened, and spread out in one
corner; and by its side the three or four "pahs" (mat-work covered baskets)
containing her changes of clothing, books, medicines, etc., are placed. A
bamboo, about ten feet long, is extended from the floor to a beam overhead; and
a long strip of cloth is stretched from one wall to the bamboo, and at right
angles to another wall, thus forming a room eight or ten feet square.</p>
<p>If the village possesses such a thing as a bedstead, it is often brought up
and placed in the chapel before her arrival: but the experienced missionary
generally prefers to spread a bed on the floor; for these bedsteads, like the
houses from which they came, are more than likely to be swarming with vermin.
The chapel, being used only for purposes of worship, is the cleanest house in
the village. During the missionary's visit, however, it is generally thronged
from morning till night by people from all the region about; some wanting
medicine, some counsel, some sympathy, some encouragement, while the great mass
are a curious gaping crowd of heathen men, women, and children, who must be
talked with kindly, their strange irrelevant questions answered, and the gospel
preached to them in all faithfulness.</p>
<p>On these tours Mrs. Vinton was often obliged to settle questions upon church
discipline, and disputes between church members; and even questions of law, in
the absence of courts, were submitted to her for her judgment and decision. In
these latter cases she called the witnesses before her, and, having heard all
the testimony on both sides, gave her decision; and from her opinion there
never was any appeal. Her sound sense and thorough knowledge of native
character were of greater assistance to her than Blackstone, or Coke upon
Littleton.</p>
<p>During the day she remained in the chapel, receiving all who came to her. In
the evening, as soon as the sun was down, she was out visiting from house to
house, ministering to the sick and aged, and urging the claims of religion upon
the few who were too proud or indifferent to come to see her. Making the chapel
in the Christian village her head-quarters, she visited other villages in the
neighborhood, sometimes walking over in the morning and returning in the
evening, or occasionally going after sunset and returning by moonlight. In
these walks she was always accompanied by the native pastor and a number of the
Christian disciples, who went with her, not only to second her efforts, but to
show the heathen that they honored their teacher.</p>

<p><b>A KAREN CHAPEL.</b></p>
</center>
<p>In their desire to make this manifest, they sometimes went to an extent that
Mrs. Vinton would not have sanctioned, had she been consulted before hand; and
yet it was so evidently the natural outburst of a wish to show to the world how
much they loved her, and how much they wished to honor her, that she could not
find it in her heart to reprove them.</p>
<p>As an example of their method of showing their appreciation, one instance
will suffice. It furnished a great deal of amusement to the excellent Mrs.
Ingalls, who happened to witness it. She was travelling among the Burman
villages in her field; and hearing that Mrs. Vinton was in the neighborhood,
she went to the Karen village to enjoy one of those rare opportunities for
Christian intercourse, and the interchange of sympathy and thought, which come
so seldom to the worn and pre-occupied missionary.</p>
<p>The day passed in this delightful communion; and, as night drew nigh, Mrs.
Ingalls prepared to take her departure, when Mrs. Vinton told her that the next
morning a company of Karens were coming to take her to a village ten miles
distant, to spend a few days in Christian work.</p>
<p>"Why," said Mrs. Ingalls, "you will pass a village which I very much wish to
visit."</p>
<p>"Stay with me all night then, and we will take you to your destination in
the morning," said Mrs. Vinton.</p>
<p>Every thing was prepared for leaving the village by daybreak, in order to
avoid exposure to the intense heat; and then, as soon as the chapel was cleared
of the mingled crowd of Karens and Burmans, the two missionaries retired to
rest.</p>
<p>It was a bright moonlight night; and about two o'clock in the morning they
were awakened by the sound of distant gongs, the jingle of bells, and the
shrill notes of native flutes. While they were wondering what it might mean,
and vainly trying to compose themselves again to sleep, the noise drew nearer
and nearer, and at last ceased just before the chapel. Then voices were heard,
"We have come for the mamma. Is she ready to go?" In a few moments all was
bustle and confusion. A dozen fires were kindled, and a dozen rice-pots set on
to boil, in preparation for feasting the crowd who had "Come for the mamma;"
and then the "Kalah cook" was hustled out of his sleepy corner by an officious
native, and told to get ready a cup of tea and some fried duck's eggs for the
mamma, before she should start.</p>
<p>Sleep was out of the question, even if it had not been for a gentle voice
outside the curtain saying, "We will be ready to put mamma's bed and pahs into
the cart as soon as she has risen."*</p>
<p>[Footnote: * Native etiquette requires that in speaking to an older person,
or superior, the third person should be used.]</p>
<p>Another inducement was not wanting to rouse Mrs. Vinton from slumber. Mrs.
Ingalls had her by the shoulder, and was alternately shaking her, and stopping
to give vent to her hearty and mirth-inspiring laugh as she said, "Get up! We
are going to ride in state this morning." Then she would run, and peep through
the cracks in the chapel wall, and come back with fresh accounts each time of
the number of carts standing in the moonlit space in front of the chapel, of
the gay dresses of the young men and women who had come as escort, and finally
of the astounding fact that in some way oxen, instead of buffaloes, had been
procured to draw two of the carts. This latter feature added as much dignity to
the occasion as the substitution of Arab steeds for omnibus horses would do in
this country. All who have ever been fortunate enough to meet this noble woman,
Mrs. Ingalls, who owes much of her success to her joyous, merry disposition,
which was now bubbling over at the oddity and weirdness of this whole
proceeding, can imagine that in another minute Mrs. Vinton was laughing as
heartily as Mrs. Ingalls, while they dressed themselves, and proceeded to take
their room to pieces and finish the packing of their scanty luggage.</p>
<p>By the time the Karens had eaten their rice, the ladies had taken a cup of
tea and some bread, and all was ready for the start. The carts had been filled
with clean rice-straw; and, in the handsomest one, Mrs. Vinton's mattress had
been placed to serve as a seat, while the pahs and other luggage had been
placed in another.</p>

<p><b>A BUFFALO-CART.</b></p>
</center>
<p>The procession then took up its march. First came a company of young men,
two of them beating gongs. Then came the cart containing Mrs. Vinton and Mrs.
Ingalls. It was drawn by two of the sleekest oxen, with bells strung around
their necks on a broad band of red cloth. By its side walked young men and
maidens in holiday attire. Then came another company of men and women; then the
next cart; and so on until the procession ended in a mixed assembly, who had
somehow imbibed the idea that the larger the escort, the more the heathen would
be impressed with the dignity of the Christian religion.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ingalls seemed as much impressed as the heathen could have been, not
with the dignity of religion, which, indeed, needed no such outward show, but
with the love and devotion manifested toward the teacher who had sacrificed so
much for them. She enlivened the long, slow ride with her merry comments on the
extra carving bestowed upon their cart, on the gay trappings of the sober oxen,
the delights of riding by moonlight to the inspiring strains of music, and the
honor of being attended to their destination by such an escort, with now and
then a witty thrust at the Burmans who accompanied the party, which kept all in
a roar of laughter.</p>
<p>"See!" she would say, "see how the Karens treat their mamma. If she wants to
go any where they come after her in carts, and such carts! Drawn by oxen too,
all trimmed up with red belts and streamers and bells. And then, as if that
were not enough, all these handsome young men and women to keep her company,
and show the people that they love their mamma! Oh, it almost makes me wish I
were a Karen missionary! When I wish to go anywhere, I have to walk; and if I
can find two or three disciples to go with me, and show me the way, I think
myself fortunate. But never mind: now I am with Mamma Vinton, and share in her
honors and her privileges. The Burmans will learn by and by."</p>
<p>Soon the morning dawned over the broad paddy-plains, and they began to meet
companies of Karens and Burmans going forth to their work. Whenever they met a
party of Burmans, or passed through a Burman village, Mrs. Ingalls would call
out to them in a cheery voice, while her eye danced with merriment, "Look! see
how the Karen mamma travels. Is not this grand? Do you hear the gongs? Do you
see all this display? The Karens come forth to meet their mamma with the honor
she deserves. After this I shall expect to have the Burmans treat me so. I,
too, shall ride in a handsome cart, drawn by sleek oxen, with music and
bells."</p>
<p>The Burmans, who loved Mrs. Ingalls as much as the Karens did Mrs. Vinton,
although they were not yet so ready to show it, nodded laughingly at her
bantering tone, and said "Yes, yes! the mamma shall not walk any more. She
shall ride as well as the Karen mamma."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<pre>
"'Tis first the good and then the beautiful,
    Not first the beautiful and then the good;
First the wild moor, with rock and reed and pool,
    Then the flower-blossom or the branching wood."
</pre>
<p>However, jungle travel was not a continued picnic or triumphal procession.
It had its dark side as well as its light. Sleeping in a boat amid the
fever-laden fogs of the river, or in an open chapel, with nothing but a single
thickness of cloth between her and "all out doors;" waking in the night to find
a centipede or snake coiled up in bed by her side; riding after runaway
buffaloes, and then reaching a village only to talk until she was hoarse, to
hearers who would continually interrupt her with the most irrelevant questions
concerning the whiteness of her skin, the size of her nose, or the manner of
her dress,--all these were no holiday experiences, and yet she rarely spoke of
these things. Her accounts of her journeys were always filled with stories of
the kindness shown her by the Christians; of the number of bright children who
were ready to come into the village or city schools; of the way the
affectionate and grateful people had loaded her boat down with rice, chickens,
plantains, etc.; and, above all, of the numbers who had been baptized.</p>
<p>The Karens showed their desire to gratify her in even trifling things; and
some amusing scenes occurred from their attempts to furnish her with such
little luxuries as were obtainable in the jungle.</p>
<p>For instance, it was very difficult to obtain milk, even in quantities
sufficient for the morning cup of coffee or the noonday cup of tea. The natives
were not in the habit of using milk in any form, and of course the buffalo-cows
were not accustomed to being milked. Knowing this, Mrs. Vinton seldom expected
to get any milk outside of the city; but not unfrequently it would happen,
that, learning her fondness for it, the Karens would search among their herds
until they found a buffalo cow with a young calf.</p>
<p>The unfortunate youngster then soon found himself tied to a stout post for
the night, far from his anxious parent. Next morning the fun, or the trouble,
began. The calf was brought and tied near the mother; and then a group of ten
or twenty stalwart young men surrounded the cow. A rope, secured to her neck,
was twisted round a post, and the end held by a Karen. Two or three men seized
the massive horns. Another rope was cautiously passed around the creature's
hind-legs, and either secured to a post, or held by Karens. The remainder of
the crowd stood round, ready for any sudden emergency.</p>
<p>Then one daring Karen, who was as unused to milking as the poor buffalo was
to being milked, drew near, with a betel-box cover in his hand, to receive the
rich creamy fluid; but at the first touch of his hand--"Whoosh!"--a kick, a
snort, and a series of plunges, and everything had broken loose, and chaos
seemed to have come again. The "tying-up" process was gone over again
patiently, and more thoroughly; and with a firm look, but trembling hand, the
dauntless Karen returned to the attack, while the by-standers seized every
"objective point" of the animal. Perhaps the milker succeeded this time in
securing a few spoonfuls of milk, while the now frantic animal kicked and
plunged with all her might. Then active hostilities would cease for a time, to
allow both parties to recruit their exhausted energies. Generally, during the
next skirmish, the betel-box would be kicked out of the milker's hand, and
stepped upon.</p>
<p>"<i>Experientia docet;</i>" and one more wise than the rest would suggest
that the milk, as fast as obtained, should be poured into another receptacle,
and thus secured against accident.</p>
<p>The amount of milk obtained in this way would vary from half a cupful to a
quart, or in rare cases two quarts, according to the kicking capacity of the
buffalo, and the endurance of the Karens. When milked into a clean receptacle
(and the Karens soon learned that this was a desirable little item to the
mamma), it was a great treat; for it was rich and creamy, and, if boiled, would
keep for several days, and furnish cream enough to make a little pat of an
ounce or two of butter. The cream, by the way, is churned in a large-mouthed
quart bottle, by vigorously shaking it until butter comes.</p>
<p>Almost every missionary can furnish, from his own experience, scenes similar
to the above. Mr. Luther on one occasion, after watching the futile attempts of
a party of Karens to get enough milk for his cup of coffee, offered to "show
them how to milk." It happened that, as the buffalo-cow had proved unusually
refractory, the calf had been led up, to persuade the mother to "give down." It
was quietly enjoying its long-deferred breakfast, and trying to make up for
lost time, when it caught sight of the approaching missionary. With a whoop and
a bellow, which rang through the village like the sound of a trumpet, it backed
over the Karen who was holding it, and started for the jungle. The mother
turned to look for her vanishing offspring, "which was not wont so to do," when
she, too, caught sight of the missionary; and, overturning the dozen or more
Karens who were holding her, she disappeared in a cloud of dust.</p>
<p>The intense dislike which both Karens and Burmans have for milk, butter, and
cheese, is not easily accounted for. When we consider the fact that some of
them eat monkeys and snakes; that many will eat the flesh of an animal which
died of disease; that the honey which they use is generally mixed with
brood-comb, containing thousands of young bees, which, in the native
estimation, adds greatly to the flavor; that the white-ant queen,--a pulpy mass
two inches long, resembling an enormous white grub,--and the palm-worm, which
is about the same size and of similar appearance, are regarded as special
delicacies,--we cannot but wonder that a cup of pure fresh milk, or a roll of
delicious butter, is regarded by them with such infinite disgust.*</p>
<p>[Footnote: * The natives are now, however, gradually overcoming this
prejudice, and are learning to like milk, or at least tolerate it.]</p>
<p>The articles enumerated above by no means cover the list of dietary
peculiarities among the Karens. Of this people, it must in truth be said,
"<i>De gustibus non est disputandum.</i>" Their attachment to <i>Nya-eu</i>
(fermented fish) is as extraordinary as it is universal and undying. This
article forms a part of every curry: it is boiled with vegetables, it is fried
and eaten with rice; in fact, it seems as necessary to a native as the very air
he breathes. To appreciate this delicacy, it is needful to know how it is
prepared. To the new missionary, however, all that is necessary is for him to
get one whiff of its powerful odor, to make him utterly indifferent to its mode
of preparation, and only anxious to put space between him and the jar
containing it.</p>
<p>The fish are caught by placing huge nets across the streams. They are then
spread out in the hot sun until they have reached a decided state of
fermentation. Salt and pepper, and frequently a species of clay, are mixed with
the fragrant mass; and thenceforward it stands prepared to delight the palate
of every Karen or Burman, in any form of cookery. Almost every returned
missionary has heard the question asked, "Why cannot the missionaries live as
the natives do? It would be such a saving of expense. Why must they have a cook
to prepare their meals separately? Do they feel themselves too good to eat food
prepared by the natives for their own use?"</p>
<p>Argument and explanation are not always satisfactory; but Rev. Mr. Bunker
brought home with him recently an unanswerable reply to these questions. It is
a small jar of this fish, just as the natives use it. To such "vain
questionings" he replies by uncorking the jar, and offering it to the
inquisitive friend for a smell. It is the most convincing statement of the
subject which can be imagined. To tell one of these fault-finders that not a
Karen knows how to prepare a single article which the missionary can eat except
plain boiled rice, ought to be enough; but, if it is not, Mr. Bunker's little
jar, with the information that "some of that" goes into every dish prepared by
the Karens, will convince the most skeptical.</p>
<p>Not only are foolish questions asked with regard to food, but the matter of
clothing often troubles the minds of some of the "economical" friends of
missions. A gentleman just returned from the mission field was once asked by a
lady, "Why do you not live as the natives do? Eat as they eat, and dress as
they dress? If you did, the missionaries would not require half as large
salaries. Why this waste?"</p>
<p>The missionary answered, "Madam, would you have our wives and children dress
as the natives do?" "Certainly if they are not <i>too proud</i>," was the
reply.</p>
<p>"Well, Madam," he said, as he looked her steadily in the face, "perhaps
<i>you</i> would. A large proportion of the middle-aged women when about their
daily work, wear nothing whatever above the waist, and only a single garment
below; and the children run perfectly nude until ten or twelve years of age.
Such a revolution in dress <i>would</i> make quite a saving in the item of
missionary expenditure of the Missionary Union and the Woman's Missionary
Society, if you can induce them to recommend it, and the missionaries to adopt
it."</p>
<p>She made no reply, but doubtless resolved for the future to think before she
spoke.</p>
<p>We have often heard as hasty criticisms upon the fact that the missionary
ladies do not do their own house-work; and it has been plainly intimated that
the reason is, that the strong sensible young woman, who, from her childhood
has practised all the various arts of housekeeping, from the splitting of
kindlings, and wiping dishes, to the preparation of an elaborate dinner, has
undergone such a transformation, such an "uplifting," on the voyage to India,
that by the time she reaches there, she is <i>too proud</i> to do her own
house-work.</p>
<p>It would do some of our New England housekeepers good to be set down in one
of our missionary cook-houses, and told to prepare a dinner. "Where is my
stove?" is the first anxious query?</p>
<p>"My good friend, there is not a stove within a thousand miles. Those little
fires on the ground, with the iron tripods over them, are your substitute for a
stove."</p>
<p>"But where is the chimney? I cannot cook where the smoke blows into my eyes
so!"</p>
<p>"There is no chimney, my friend. You must keep to windward of your fires,
and let the smoke go out at the openings between the roof and the low
wals."</p>
<p>"But where is my sink? my hot and cold water faucets? my cistern-water? my
----"</p>
<p>"Gently, gently, not so fast," responds the good genius of the place; and
leading her to the door, he points to several large jars of water standing on
the ground near by. "There is your sink. Hot water can be supplied by your
tea-kettle. The cold water you can bring from the well only about a hundred
yards away."</p>
<p>"But I don't see any well or any pump."</p>
<p>"True, the well is only a deep pit, and it is at the foot of that hill; but
this bucket and rope are an excellent substitute for a pump. Be careful not to
slip into the well, for it has no curb."</p>
<p>"But I cannot use such water as that: it is thick with mud!"</p>
<p>"True: but you must filter what you wish for the table; and, if you let the
water stand for half a day, a good portion of the mud will settle."</p>
<p>"Where are my pantry--my dish closet--my store room?" she asks, as the shade
deepens on her face, and the sun glares hotter and hotter out of doors.</p>
<p>"All those you will find at the house, only forty or fifty yards away. The
danger from fire is so great in the dry season, that the cook-house is often
built farther away than this."</p>
<p>"I don't see any oven," is the next complaint. Upon this she is pointed to
the large earthen jar half filled with sand, and told that if she builds a fire
under it, and places a sheet of iron covered with hot coals over the mouth, she
can in time learn to bake pretty well with that; or, if she prefers, she can
have an old-fashioned brick oven built.</p>
<p>"Where am I to wash my dishes and clean my lamps?" she asks.</p>
<p>"At the house you will find a shelf projecting from the veranda, on which
are two earthenware pans, in which you can wash dishes. When you wish hot
water, you can bring your tea-kettle up from the cook-house."</p>
<p>"Where am I to mould my bread and make my pies?"</p>
<p>"You can make your pies up at the house, on any convenient table. As for
bread, you will have to buy it; for the only yeast to be had is made from the
juice of the toddy-palm, and that requires a government permit to obtain it. As
the application must be made through your magistrate, and may take five or six
days before you obtain the permit, you will find that it is better to buy your
bread from the natives, who have bought yearly permits to gather the juice and
make the yeast. Besides, you will find, that, if you try to keep flour in the
house, it will soon be swarming with worms, and will probably become useless
before you can use up a barrel."</p>
<p>The poor woman thinks of her mother's large, airy kitchen, with its clean
floor, its shining stove, the sink with hot and cold water to be had at the
turning of a faucet, the endless array of pots, sauce-pans, griddles, kettles,
tinware, earthen-ware, dippers, strainers, toasters, graters, sifters,
steamers, egg-beaters, and other utensils; and she gently suggests, that, in
the bracing climate of New England, house-work with all these labor-saving
implements is no child's play; and that, unless she can have better tools to
work with, she fears she will have to hire one of the dozen strong men who are
at her elbow, each one begging for the chance to do all her cooking, washing
dishes, etc., for the modest sum of a dollar and a half a week, and he will
board and clothe himself.</p>
<p>The hitherto patient genius frowns and says, "You are above your position!
What are you more than your sisters in America, that you cannot do your own
house-work?"</p>
<p>"But circumstances alter cases," she suggests. "Here I have nothing but a
tea-kettle, a couple of frying-pans, and two or three earthen jars, and a fire
on the ground. I can never learn to cook with these; and besides, in this hot
climate how long do you think I would last, trotting through the hot sun to
draw water from a well a hundred yards away, crouching over these smoky fires
with the thermometer at a hundred degrees in the shade, and running back and
forth from the house every time I want a dish or an article from my
store-room."</p>
<p>"Well," is the reply a little severely, "probably you would not live more
than a year or two; but then, on your gravestone could be inscribed, 'The
victim of Economy and Humility.' And the dollar and a half per week saved could
be devoted to making up to your husband and children for your loss, and in
re-imbursing the Missionary Union for your outfit and passage money."</p>
<p>After all, this is only a very low view to take of this much vexed question.
There is a yet higher principle involved, but it is apparent only to those who
are capable of taking a broad and comprehensive view of Christian duty. It
should be the aim of every faithful laborer to do, not necessarily "the next
thing," as some writer puts it, which may be something very paltry and
unnecessary, but when a selection must be made from a mass of things, to do
what, under God, will most conduce to his glory, and the eternal good of souls.
Washing dishes or doing house-work may be, and often is, a means of serving
God, and in many cases a Christian duty; but if allowed to stand in the way of
a call to the performance of a duty of a higher nature, the salvation of a
soul, or the teaching of one ignorant of God, such an absorption in the "much
serving" merits and receives the Master's rebuke.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to explain, to those who all their lives have been
accustomed to the division of labor which prevails in this country, the
multitudinous cares which crowd upon the foreign missionary every day, until
his chief thought becomes, "How can I make one pair of hands do the work of
ten?" The inventor who takes some unsightly lumps of iron and steel, and makes
a machine which will lighten his own or other's labor, is not necessarily a
lazy man; nor is the machinist who takes an awkward, ignorant youth, and, by
patient teaching, transforms him into a skilled workman, necessarily "above his
work." We call such men benefactors; but when, on the mission field, a skilled
workman for God teaches a native lad how to black his boots or groom his pony,
in order that he, the missionary, may have time to devote to the translation of
the Bible into the boy's native tongue,--a work which will not only benefit the
lad, but millions of his countrymen,--what an outcry do we hear because the
missionary is too proud to black his own boots!</p>
<p>Imagine one Christian minister and his wife placed in Boston, and consider
them as the sole representatives of the Christian religion in Eastern
Massachusetts. Wipe out the State Convention, the Sunday School Union, the city
missions, the public and private schools, the libraries, and the book-stores.
Drive every educated man and woman from the State, and leave in their places a
mass of ignorant and depraved creatures, who have every thing to learn which is
worth knowing, and only the aforesaid minister and his wife to teach them. The
minister, by the way, is a foreigner. The gospel must be preached, and a
foreign language learned in which to preach it; and, before public worship can
be established, portions of the Bible must be translated and hymns prepared.
Calls come from all parts of the State for a visit from the overburdened
preacher, who feels that the masses of one city are more than he alone can
preach to, while acting the part of translator, physician, and druggist for the
entire community.</p>
<p>A hasty visit to Springfield, Fitchburg, Worcester, and Lawrence, results in
the conversion of over a hundred souls. These he must baptize, and organize
into churches; and there he is, without a Bible or a catechism to give them,
not a pastor nor a school-teacher to send them, and all the powers of hell
combined to draw away the weak, ignorant believers from their new-found hope.
He hastens home to urge his wife to put out her washing, and take the time to
teach a few children to read; and he asks her if she cannot find time to give
them a little Bible instruction each day, so that when a portion of the New
Testament is translated, a catechism translated, a spelling-book prepared, and
an elementary arithmetic and a geography through the press, which will soon be
sent him from China, these wild, ignorant children shall be able to take these
books, and return to their homes as teachers, and, if converted (as he trusts
they may be), as preachers. As he rides along in his ox-cart, he sighs as he
remembers that years must elapse before all this can be accomplished; but it
never will be done unless it is begun. So he mentally resolves to give up the
notion which he has had, that no one can iron his shirts or his white neckties
quite as nicely as his wife, and allow her to hand over this department of her
work to one of the numerous laundrymen of Boston. When he reaches home, he
finds his wife engaged in the sad duty of preparing for burial the body of a
woman who has just died of cholera, and whose friends and neighbors have all
fled and left her to her fate. His wife left her own children to the care of
some young girls next door, while she went and sat by the side of the
suffering, dying creature; and not only smoothed her pathway to the grave, but
turned her dying eyes to the Lamb of God, who alone could take away her sin;
and she had the joy of seeing her depart in the triumphs of faith. The dying
woman with her latest breath besought the missionary's wife to take her four
little ones to train up for God; and faithfully must the solemn trust be
fulfilled.</p>
<p>She cheerfully acquiesces in her husband's plan; and the four children,
after being washed and clothed in new, clean garments (which she must make
herself), are added to those whom her husband has brought in from the country;
and she still tries to go on with their instruction, in addition to all her
other cares and duties, visiting the sick in the neighborhood, and entertaining
the scores of men and women who come in every day. Her school rapidly
increases; and now numbers of the idle, vagrant children, who formerly spent
their time in the streets, are found in her back parlor, learning of Jesus.
They are dirty and filthy in the extreme; and they have so much vermin in their
hair and clothing that the patient teacher is compelled in self-defence to do
something to prevent her house from becoming unendurable to herself and her
family. This woman, who, according to some of her would-be critics, is "too
proud to do her own washing," shows these children how to use soap and water,
and with her own hands cuts off the matted shock of hair, immediately burns it,
and then washes the running sores on the head, applying some healing ointment,
and clothes the children in garments which she has made out of material for
which her husband's scanty purse has paid. And now the work is--just begun. The
children are sweet and clean for once in their lives; but, unless a reformation
is wrought in their homes, they will soon be in the same condition in which
they were before. The already over-taxed wife and mother determines to put out
her sewing, and get a girl to come and help in the care of her own little ones,
so that she may give more time to visiting the women at their homes, and
teaching them how to keep their houses and their families in a better
condition. She goes into the miserable dens and hovels, lets in the sunlight
and fresh air, and tells the women that their homes would be more presentable
and their families healthier if they would not throw all the refuse matter out
of the doors and windows. She furnishes them soap, brooms, wash-tubs, combs,
needles, and thread, and teaches them how to use them; and still the work grows
on her. She must have books for her pupils, which her husband has not time to
translate. A large number of women are begging her to allow them to come in the
evenings, and learn to sew, and to read God's word. Deputations come in daily
from Chelsea, from Newton, from Cambridge, Waltham, Woburn, and Lynn, inquiring
if she cannot come to their homes, and teach them too. People are dying all
around her for the lack of simple remedies she alone possesses, and knows how
to use.</p>
<p>Now, suppose she still plods on in her kitchen, baking, broiling, and
mopping, because she cannot bear to give up all her home duties. Her conscience
goads her occasionally as she meets professional cooks in the street, who would
be glad to do this work for a mere pittance; and she sometimes wonders whether
her time would not be better spent in feeding the starving, healing the sick,
and teaching the ignorant, than in watching for the critical moment when a loaf
of cake should come out of the oven.</p>
<p>She takes the matter to God; and in her closet she seems to hear the voice
of Jesus saying, "Go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come
in, that my house may be full." Ah! she knows she need not to compel. Eager
faces are looking into hers, and crying, "Come over and help us." Helpless
women are stretching forth their hands to her for aid. Young children there
are, whose tender feet need but a little guiding to lead them into the "shining
way." There are dying ones to be pointed to Jesus, bereaved ones to be
comforted; and, on the other hand, her kitchen duties. She weighs the question
well, and let us hesitate to pronounce her proud if she decides, that, as the
only woman in all Massachusetts who can do this work for the souls and bodies
of her suffering sisters, while there are hundreds who can do her cooking, her
duty lies in the varied directions we have indicated, and that she must give up
her necessary housework for the no less necessary harvest-work to which her
Master has equally called her.</p>
<p>It is difficult to speak upon this subject without being gravely
misunderstood. No Christian woman would underrate housework, or regard any
thing which tended to promote the comfort of her family as menial or
unimportant; but let not the women to whom God has committed this work look
with scorn upon the women to whom he has committed another department of labor.
So long as we do not stigmatize as proud the public school-teacher, who not
only teaches all day, but works late into the night over her examination papers
and reports, or the skilful lady-physician who finds her days too short to
attend to all the calls upon her time and services, because neither of them do
their own house-work, we should hesitate to criticise our lady missionaries,
who combine in their work, not only many of the duties of these two, but of
half a dozen others beside. As has been before intimated, ignorance lies at the
foundation of all such criticism; but it is time that the hard-working women of
America, who are saving their pennies and consecrating their dollars through
much self-denial, should know that their sisters on the foreign fields are not
living lives of ease and indolence, because they do not do their own housework,
or stand at the wash-tub. They have to penetrate into dens and hovels swarming
with vermin, and grapple with filth and disease in their most loathsome form.
They must needs sit patiently for hours with crowds around them, none of whom
are too clean, and many of them offensive in the extreme, listening to their
complaints, or trying to instil into their darkened and brutalized intellects a
drop of celestial knowledge.</p>
<p>Believe me, my sisters, as one who has tried it, the duties of a clean
New-England kitchen, with the fresh bracing air coming in at the windows, are
often, under such circumstances, remembered with a sigh of painful longing.</p>
<p>The foregoing may seem unnecessary and uncalled for. Our readers may say,
"Every one knows that a missionary cannot be occupied with household affairs;"
but alas! every one does <i>not</i> know. Only a short time ago an intelligent
lady, who supposed herself well informed upon such matters, said to a returned
missionary, "In my opinion the reason why missionaries are so anxious to return
to their field of labor, is because they live in such luxury, and have so many
servants. Of course they cannot be contented in this country where they have to
do their own work." A very wealthy lady was asked to assist in the preparation
of the outfit of one of our missionaries. Looking at the list of articles she
saw the item "two dozen shirts." "What does he want so many shirts for?" she
asked at once. It was explained that as the washermen sometimes kept the
clothing sent them to be laundried for two or three weeks, owing to the
incessant rains, it was necessary to have a comparatively large supply of
wearing apparel on hand. She at once refused to do any thing toward the
preparation of the outfit, on the ground that the missionary's wife was too
proud to do her own washing, and <i>she</i> would not countenance such
extravagance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<pre>
"No slacker grows the fight,
    No feebler is the foe,
No less the need of armor tried,
    Of shield and spear and bow."
</pre>
<p>The privacy of the dear old home in America is another of the comforts that
the foreign missionary lays upon the altar. Henceforth his home and every room
in it is as public a place as the halls and parlor of a hotel. The natives have
no idea of privacy; and they come into the missionary's house at all hours, and
walk through the rooms, examining the articles of furniture or clothing,
admiring here, questioning there, experimenting somewhere else, without a
thought that they are intruding. In that hot climate no doors are closed during
the day, and short curtains are hung in the doorways to screen the occupants,
and yet admit air above and below. The natives, unaccustomed to even these
slight barriers, pull them aside, and look in without having the slightest
appreciation of our desire to be alone when we are at the toilet; and they will
not unfrequently come into the bedroom before the missionary or his wife have
risen.</p>
<p>Such little intrusions must be dealt with in the most gentle manner. A rough
word would drive the whole party from the house, never to return again; and the
missionary's influence would be much weakened thereby. A smiling "Please do not
come in here just now: we are dressing, and it is not our custom to visit with
friends when we are putting on our clothes," is the best way of greeting a
company of men and women coming into a missionary's bedroom at five o'clock in
the morning. They will back out precipitately, perhaps overturning one or two
in their sudden retreat; but probably in an hour from then, if the lady of the
house goes into her room and draws the curtain behind her, some curious old man
will follow her and peep in, to see for what purpose she went in there. This
total want of privacy is a great trial at first; but it is one which must be
borne with most patiently, if the missionary would win the love and confidence
of his people.</p>
<p>But we must return to Mrs. Vinton, and tell how she made these "household
troubles" an efficient means of missionary effort. She was in the habit of
taking boys and girls into her service; and while teaching them how to cook,
and do housework, sometimes under the supervision for a month or two of a
"Kalah cook," she had them attend school, and gave them personal instruction in
the evenings. By this means they advanced as rapidly in their studies as the
other pupils. These boys and girls were always selected from among the most
destitute; and she clothed them, and supplied all their wants from her own
purse, in return for the work which they learned in time to do; and so far from
their position being regarded as menial, they were often envied by their richer
mates because of the advantage which they derived from the extra instruction
she knew so well how to give. In one of her letters to her children she says,
"Many ask me how it is that I am always training raw Karens, and, as soon as
they begin to be useful to me, let them go from me. It is trying, but it is
part of my missionary work.</p>
<p>"No one is so blessed in their help as I am. My girls and boys serve me, not
for money, but to improve themselves, and prepare for future usefulness. I
trust that many of them will preach and teach when I am dead and gone."</p>
<p>She has passed away; but all over the jungles of the Rangoon district, and
in many other mission fields, are to be found faithful pastors, devoted
teachers, successful evangelists and Bible-readers, whom she had fitted for
their life-work. It seemed to be her lot to train up teachers, and send them
out to other fields; but there were two who were providentially permitted to
remain with her, and to aid her most materially during the last years of her
life. These were George and Isabella, the children of good old Loonee-pa, or
Maw-O, of whom mention has been made on page 203. Unlike the most of the
scholars, they were not poor; and it was not for this reason that Mrs. Vinton
bestowed special training upon them. Their home was on the mission compound, at
the foot of the hill on which Mrs. Vinton's house stood, just across a romantic
little stream which wound its way to the river. They did not, therefore, leave
town during the vacations, but spent most of their spare time in Mrs. Vinton's
house, either playing with Brainerd and Calista, or poring over illustrated
papers and picture-books.</p>
<p>Their father was at that time a wealthy timber merchant, and a most devoted
and faithful supporter of the mission so long as God gave him the ability.</p>
<p>Calista and little Naw Chung-Gah (Isabella) soon became fast friends. The
latter slept on a mat in Calista's room, and shared in the use of all her books
and playthings, receiving in common with Loo-nee (George) much extra
instruction from Mrs. Vinton. Both were remarkably precocious children, and
evinced much fondness for study. Loo-nee so distinguished himself in the public
examinations that he was called, by English officers, Christopher Columbus,
George Washington, Daniel Webster, Shakspeare, and other distinguished names.
He much preferred George Washington to all the other cognomens which had been
thus playfully bestowed upon him, and assumed it as his name. In time
Washington was dropped, and his family name Ogh or O added in its place.</p>
<p>The Karens have a curious custom of changing a man's name after the birth of
a son, and calling him by the name of the son, adding the affix "father of."
Thus Maw-O's name after Loo-nee's birth became Loo-nee-pah. The mother, in like
manner, lost her name, and became Loo-nee-mo, or the mother of Loo-nee.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Vinton's children were sent to America to school, Calista called
her little friend aside, and told her how lonely her father and mother would
be, and how they would miss the many tender little offices she had been
accustomed to perform; and she begged the little Karen girl to fill her place
as far as possible. She taught her how to do many little things for which they
had depended on the daughter's care, and charged her not to let them miss these
little offices of kindness.</p>
<p>So tenderly and faithfully did the good child fulfil the trust imposed on
her, that the bereaved parents on several occasions burst into tears, on
finding that the Lord had indeed sent them another daughter to minister to and
to comfort them while their own was in America. Thus, with the cheerful consent
of her own father and mother, Naw Chung-Gah was installed in Calista's room.
After a time her name was changed to Isabella, a name by which she had been
sometimes called before Calista went to America. In Mrs. Vinton's letters to
her children are found frequent references to the rapid progress Isabella made
in her studies, and to the dutiful affection she showed to her foster-parents.
She soon became fitted to take charge of younger classes in the school, and
every year became increasingly useful.</p>
<p>She took charge of the house when Mrs. Vinton was absent in the jungle with
Mr. Vinton. She was ever watchful and thoughtful for their comfort, and, in
times of sickness, was a most tender and devoted nurse.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vinton often said that her own daughter could not have shown more
filial affection; yet when she went down to her father's house, she was just as
gentle and dutiful to her own parents as to Mr. and Mrs. Vinton.</p>
<p>Many, many times has the remark been made by those familiar with the
mission, that, if Mrs. Vinton had done nothing else than to train up such an
efficient helper and teacher as Isabella, she would not have lived in vain.
Both she and her brother George had frequent opportunities to take positions
elsewhere as teachers at large salaries, but they chose to stay with Mrs.
Vinton; and it is impossible to speak too highly of the important and efficient
service they rendered. George not only became a most successful teacher, but
aided the mission greatly as a translator, owing to his critical and thorough
acquaintance with the English language.</p>
<p>In thus mentioning these two, no disparagement is intended or implied with
regard to the scores of other devoted teachers and laborers who were trained by
Mrs. Vinton in different periods of her missionary life, and who also rendered
invaluable aid to the mission in the various localities where duty placed them.
Such helpers as Tah-loo, Dee-Hai, Thah-mway and his wife Eliza, Naw-Oo-thah,
Lai-Nyoh, Gna-Dee, Lai Nah, Fidelia, Sarah and Ella, two sisters given to Mrs.
Vinton by their dying mother, Gna Kaing, Catherine, Naw-nai-naw, Livy, and
<i>many</i> others whose names are written in heaven, have a bright record here
on earth, and a brighter one above. We mention George and Isabella thus
particularly, because they were more personally identified with Mrs. Vinton in
her work in the city school, and were privileged to remain with her to the end,
ministering to her in her last moments, and following her beloved remains to
the grave on the hill-top, where husband and wife now sleep side by side,
surrounded by the precious dust of many of their faithful and beloved
disciples, almost under the shadow of the mighty Shway Dagon.</p>
<p>In 1861 Brainerd Vinton, having completed his college course at Madison
University, married Julia A., the eldest daughter of Rev. Dr. Haswell of the
Maulmain Burman Mission. Receiving a unanimous call from the Karen churches of
the Rangoon district to be their missionary, he set sail from Boston in
September, and reached Rangoon in due time.</p>
<p>He found his mother and sister in failing health, owing to the accumulation
of cares and duties which had rested on them since his father's death; but it
was hoped that both would rally, and that the relief experienced from his
arrival would give them an opportunity to regain strength without being obliged
to return to America. Mrs. Vinton, although so weak and prostrated, started at
once with Brainerd for a long trip among the jungle churches; and great were
the rejoicings of the people to learn that "the son of his father" had come
back to them.</p>
<p>A severe illness, on her return from the jungle, made it evident, that, if
her life were to be spared, an immediate return to America was absolutely
necessary. It had been decided some time previously that Calista must seek a
cooler climate as soon as any one could be found in whose company she might
make the voyage, as she was too weak to travel alone; and Mrs. Vinton
sorrowfully began to open her eyes to the fact that she, too, must leave her
beloved work, and turn her face toward America. No one who has not gone through
this trial can in any degree realize the painful character of the struggle
through which her mind passed before coming to this conclusion.</p>
<p>It seemed so much easier and better to work on while life should last, and
then to pass away to the rest and reward for which her soul hungered; and yet,
on the other hand, she felt it wrong to throw away life needlessly. Her
physician assured her that all she needed was a long sea-voyage, and a year or
two of entire rest; and that she might then look forward to many years of
active service on the mission field.</p>
<p>The decision was made; and in October, 1862, mother and daughter sailed in
the American ship "Vaucluse," from Rangoon to Falmouth, England. The voyage was
long and trying in the extreme. Mrs. Vinton, as usual, instant in service,
beguiled the tedium of the voyage by labors among the crew, and was rewarded
with success. Who can tell whither the ocean-winds have blown the seed sown
thus in weakness and weariness? but the fruit shall be seen in eternity.</p>
<p>In March, 1863, they landed at Falmouth, England, and were received and
hospitably entertained by warm Christian friends who had heard of their work,
though they had never seen them. From there they went to Plymouth, and thence
to Bristol, to visit Mr. George Muller and his orphan houses, in which work
Mrs. Vinton was deeply interested; since she had learned by precious experience
the blessedness of trusting the Lord for temporal as well as spiritual
supplies.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Vinton's great surprise, although this was her first visit to
England, she found, wherever she went, both hearts and homes open to receive
her, and bid her welcome in the name of the Lord. She always had a low estimate
of herself and of her labors,--considering herself a comparatively unknown
worker upon the very outskirts of the vineyard; and although her school in
Rangoon had received so many flattering commendations, and such abundant
contributions from people of all classes and of all faiths, some of them indeed
of no faith, yet she attributed all this to the interesting nature of the work,
and never dreamed that she herself could be an object of interest to any save
her personal friends. We can imagine her surprise, then, to find herself
greeted, wherever she went, with a warm-hearted, earnest cordiality, which,
though so thoroughly English, was not to be expected from those to whom she
thought herself to be a perfect stranger.</p>
<p>She had, indeed, expected a kindly welcome from the Bells, the Underhills,
Sir David Russell, Dr. Balfour, and others, with whom her husband and herself
had enjoyed pleasant Christian intercourse in Burmah; but, in addition to these
dear and cherished friends she, found many others. They gathered around her,
and not only expressed the deepest interest in her work, with every detail of
which they seemed familiar, but they invited her to their homes, and made her
feel the breadth and depth of true English hospitality, as she had never known
it before.</p>
<p>In London she was the guest of Dr. and Mrs. Underhill. With them she spent
several weeks, enjoying rare opportunities for meeting such noble Christian men
and women as Rev. Dr. Angus, Mrs. Ranyard, Rev. Dr. Brock, Sir Morton and Lady
Peto, Rev. Dr. Landels, Hon. and Rev. Baptist W. Noel, Rev. and Mrs. Trestrail,
and others, who were in such hearty sympathy with her work that she felt no
longer like a stranger in a strange land.</p>
<p>Rev. Dr. Tucker assured her that her very name was fragrant to all who were
in any way acquainted with foreign missions. The generous grants given by the
Bible and Tract Societies filled her heart with renewed confidence that God was
still providing for the needs of the beloved mission under her charge.</p>
<p>Leaving London, she went to spend a month at Cheltenham with those devoted
friends of the mission, Gen. and Mrs. Bell. Then came a brief visit to
Liverpool, where she and Calista were most hospitably entertained by Mr. and
Mrs. Jackson, of Dr Birrell's church, Pembroke Chapel; then the voyage to
America--Home!</p>
<p>We find, from letters written at this time, that Mrs. Vinton had hoped that
the passage to England would restore her health, and that a few months' rest in
that country would permit her to return to her loved work. It was, therefore, a
sore disappointment to her to find that further rest and medical treatment
would be required. She writes to her sister as follows:--</p>
<blockquote>"We have been in London a month; but my health has not improved so
much but that I fear I shall be obliged to go still farther to regain it. If
necessary I will go on, trusting that the Lord will direct my steps. I cannot
tell you how I long to get back to my school, the Karen churches, and my work
among the heathen. Much as I wish to see you and dear mother, also Lucinda"
(Mr. Vinton's sister) "and father Vinton, I would gladly take ship to-morrow
for Rangoon, if I could hope to live there, and be able to do any thing. I did
not want to leave my work; but I have come thus far, and I am praying for a
heart to say, 'Thy will be done in my sufferings as well as in my labors.'"
(April 18, 1863.)</blockquote>
<p>In June, 1863, she landed in New York, and, after but a day's rest, started
with Dr. and Mrs. Nathan Brown, formerly of the Assam Mission, for an annual
meeting of the Free Mission Society, held at Mt. Holly, New Jersey. Here she
met Mr. R. M. Luther, who had just completed his studies at Princeton (N.J.)
Theological Seminary, and who had resolved to devote himself to mission work,
though he had not settled on any particular field of labor. Her earnest appeal
for Burmah decided the question in his mind, and he offered himself at once as
a missionary to the Karens.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vinton felt that this was indeed a special answer to prayer; and she
wrote at once to her son, and to the Karen churches, that she was now convinced
that the Lord had led her steps to America, for he had sent a man who would
take charge of the High School in the city, and of other departments of the
educational work, and the printing-press. She continued, "I hope the Lord will
soon send him a good wife, so that they together may return with me."</p>
<p>She little thought that the young man whom she so enthusiastically commended
to the Karen churches was destined to be her son.*</p>
<p>[Footnote: * Nor, indeed, did "the young man" think so at that time. R. M.
L.]</p>
<p>Leaving New Jersey after a brief visit to Philadelphia, Calista was taken to
the home of her foster-parents, Rev. Dr. and Mrs. Ives, of Suffield, Conn. Mrs.
Vinton then made an all-too-brief visit to the dear old homestead in Union,
Conn., where the aged mother's eyes had grown dim with watching for the beloved
daughter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<pre>
"Another battle fought, and oh! not lost,--
    Tells of the ending of this fight and thrall;
Another ridge of time's lone moorland crossed,
    Gives nearer prospect of the jasper wall.

Gone to begin a new and happier story,
    Thy bitter tale of earth now told and done.
These outer shadows for that inner glory
    Exchanged forever.--O thrice blessed one!"
</pre>
<p>Mrs. Vinton had returned to America to rest; yet the few weeks spent in
Union and Tolland, Conn,, were really all the rest she gave herself during her
entire stay in this country. She had never realized how thoroughly her system
was broken down, and seemed to wonder that the old weariness and exhaustion
still continued; but she felt so much benefited in other ways by the bracing
air and homely food of her native land, that she promised herself an early and
complete recovery.</p>
<p>Hence when, from every part of the country, there came the most urgent
invitations to visit churches and associations, and address them upon the
subject of our missions in Burmah, she did not think of refusing, or of urging
the state of her health as an excuse for non-compliance. In this way she was in
a few weeks drawn away from her home.</p>
<p>A most memorable visit was that which she made to the Stonington Union
Association in the last week in June. Twenty-nine years before, this
association had designated the Vintons as its missionaries to the heathen.
Again in 1850 it had solemnly renewed their designation in the name of the
churches of Connecticut represented by it. On that occasion, after a most
remarkable prayer by Elder Swan, Mr. Vinton, "with his face shining like an
angel's," exclaimed, "I go bound in spirit unto Burmah, and from Burmah to
heaven."*</p>
<p>[ Footnote: * Elder Swan's Biography, p.415 ]</p>
<p>All the old-time friends had not passed away. The Rev. Dr. Palmer, whose
friendship had not wavered for one moment, the venerable Elder Swan and others,
whose tender love had been life-long, were there. Mrs. Vinton always spoke of
this last visit as the most precious thing in the long history of her
connection with the Connecticut churches.</p>
<p>From Stonington she went to Hartford, and there again renewed old
friendships. While in Hartford she determined, in answer to the many urgent
letters she had received from the West, to visit some of the churches in that
part of the country; and it was arranged that she and Mr. Luther should make a
systematic tour through the states of Ohio, Illinois, and Wisconsin, and also
through portions of Canada. In July, 1863, the journey began. After pausing at
Hamilton for the commencement exercises of Madison University, she next visited
Buffalo, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago, and the churches of Northern Illinois
and Southern Wisconsin. Returning, she addressed many of the churches in
Canada, along the line of the Grand Trunk Railway.</p>
<p>The effect of her earnest words upon the communities and churches was
thrilling. Enthusiasm was aroused everywhere, and the missionary spirit was
quickened in many places in which it had almost ceased to exist. It was
noticeable in her addresses that she made but few references to herself or to
her own work. She aimed rather at giving to our churches a clear and accurate
view of the true condition of our mission fields, in order that they might
intelligently comprehend the demands made upon the Christians in this country
for assistance. Her frequent exclamation was, "The people will give and pray
for our missions, if they only know the <i>facts</i> in regard to them. What
they need is not theory or argument, but facts;" and the facts, as taught her
by nearly thirty years of mission life, she endeavored to give them. As to the
effect produced by her inimitable addresses, we might quote largely from the
religious and secular papers of the day; but we content ourselves with but one
extract. It is from "The Canadian Missionary Link," and was published so
recently as October, 1879, sixteen years after the visit to which it
refers.</p>
<blockquote>"About sixteen years ago a returned missionary from the Karens,
Mrs. Vinton, who for years had toiled among them, after a brief stay in
America, travelling, lecturing, pleading for the perishing ones in that heathen
land, visited our institute in Woodstock, just previous to her return to her
former field of labor, and talked to us about this interesting people. I
remember well how our hearts were touched by the simple appeals of that
gray-haired, widowed missionary, who, having already spent weary years of toil
and privation among the heathen, was about to return to them in all the
freshness of her sanctified zeal for God, there to finish her toil, and thence
to ascend to her reward. How much that visit did towards turning the tide of
missionary effort of our young churches in Canada towards India, and of rousing
and impelling our young men and women forward towards those heathen lands, we
cannot say; but there is no doubt that that woman's hearty appeal and heroic
example lie far back in the chain of hallowed influences which produced the
results in our own special mission work over which we rejoice
to-day."</blockquote>
<p>In November she returned East, made a brief visit to New York and
Philadelphia. At the Central Union Association in the latter place she
delivered an address, of which it is said in "The Christian Chronicle:"--</p>
<blockquote>"No words can adequately describe the 'moments rich in blessing'
enjoyed, as the calm and sweet, yet earnest tones of the great Christian
heroine brought vividly before the audience thrilling scenes and events. The
hearers seemed really present with the speaker, as oblivious of self she was
engaged in her wonted employment in the school, or wandering through the jungle
from village to village to tell of Jesus. She led the audience from station to
station; and tears started unbidden, and sobs could not be restrained, as
abandoned posts, and aged or feeble laborers, were beheld scattered thinly
around the great central region, where seven hundred thousand people are
waiting for their 'younger brother, the white man, to come from the setting
sun, and give them the long-lost law of the Lord.' Surely no one who saw that
countenance beaming with the love of Christ will ever forget it, or cease to
pray that the mother may be spared to return to her son, and resume the work
she so dearly loves."</blockquote>
<p>Returning to New York, much against the desire and advice of all her
friends, she determined to sail at once for Burmah. She seemed to be entirely
restored to health; but it was feared, that, unless she spent a winter in
America, the restoration would be but temporary. However, her heart was in
Burmah. She could not rest day or night for thinking of the Karen churches, and
of the destitute regions beyond. So in December, 1863, she sailed for England,
and thence, by the "Overland Route" (<i>via</i> Egypt and the Red Sea), to
Calcutta and Rangoon, arriving in March, 1864.</p>
<p>She engaged immediately in the work of the mission with great hopefulness,
and in the confident expectation of many years of labor. It was soon evident,
however, that her time was short. The old disease, which had been simply
checked, not eradicated from her system, by her too brief visit to England and
America, began to make itself felt again. The close of the rains found her
busily engaged in preparing the second mission house (then known as the "Binney
House") for her daughter Calista and her husband, Rev. R. M. Luther. About Nov.
1 she was suddenly attacked with an acute form of the disease which had
followed her so long (inflammation of the alimentary canal), and was prostrated
at once.</p>
<p>From the first she had the best medical attendance which could be given her,
but without receiving any benefit whatever. Her physician, Dr. Ford, advised
her removal to the city (Rangoon), three miles away, where she might be near
his own residence, and thus make it possible for him to attend her at any
moment, and watch her case critically. Rev. Dr. Stevens very kindly received
her into his house, and there she remained until the last.</p>
<p>On the 6th of December Mr. and Mrs. Luther arrived; and the excitement
consequent on welcoming her beloved daughter produced a temporary re-action,
but in two or three days she sunk back again. From that time her only desire
seemed to be to depart and be with Christ. Frequently we who stood by her would
hear her murmur, "Come, Lord Jesus! Come quickly!" "Lord, how long! How long!"
When one day Mr. Luther repeated a number of passages from the Word, she, after
each, replied by quoting one of a similar tenor; and then she repeated the
entire twenty-third Psalm. When we would speak of her possible recovery, she
would say earnestly, "No, no! My work is done: I must go. I cannot any longer
stay away from the bright scenes which have awaited me so long. I am no longer
needed here. You will do all for the Karens that I could do, and much more. And
now I must rest."</p>
<p>Dr. Ford, an earnest and devout Christian, said to us, "I can do nothing.
The soul is fretting out the body. No remedy will act as it should, and I am
powerless. I have never seen an instance in my long experience where so much
strength of mind was manifest while the body was so prostrated."</p>
<p>On the 18th of December, 1864, a bright, beautiful morning, at eleven
o'clock, she gently, peacefully, passed away.</p>
<pre>
"Hush! Nor dare with ominous breath
    To syllable the name of <i>Death.</i>
We know she only sleepeth;
    And from the dust
Truth hath decreed her glorious resurrection."

A. W. HARE.
</pre>
<p>These imperfect records are closed. It has been a labor of love to compile,
from many fragments, this sketch of those of whom a veteran missionary
said,--</p>
<blockquote>"Seldom, if ever, has there been an instance where a missionary and
his wife were both so eminently qualified for the work, and so eminently
successful, as Justus Hatch Vinton and Calista Holman Vinton. To an uncommon
strength of mind, there was added in each a deep piety, and a strong and ardent
faith. They entered on their work purposing to make great sacrifices, and
expecting through the divine assistance to have many souls for their hire. In
these expectations they were not disappointed. To the direct labors of no other
missionary pair should we be able to trace so large a number of conversions
from heathenism."</blockquote>
<pre>
"Softly within that peaceful resting-place
    We lay their weary limbs; and bid the clay
Press lightly on them, till the night be past,
    And the far east give note of coming day.

The day of re-appearing! how it speeds!
    He who is true and faithful speaks the word:
Then shall we ever be with those we love.
    Then shall we be 'forever with the Lord.'

Short death and darkness: endless life and light
    Short dimming; endless shining in yon sphere
Where all is incorruptible and pure,
    The joy without the pain, the smile without the tear."

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
MIRANDA VINTON.
<pre>
"Needs there the praise of the love-written record,
    The name and the epitaph graved on the stone?
The things we have lived for,--let them be our story,
    We ourselves but remembered by what we have done.

Not myself, but the truth that in life I have spoken,
    Not myself, but the seed that in life I have sown,
Shall pass on to ages: all about me forgotten,
    Save the truth I have spoken, the things I have done."
</pre>
<p>The references in the foregoing memoir to Miranda Vinton, who was for twelve
years intimately associated with her brother in his work, lead us to subjoin
the following extracts from letters received from Mrs. Dr. Binney and Mrs. Dr.
Stevens, since this volume was in the hands of the publisher. We regret that it
has been impossible to collect materials for an extended notice of this
excellent and devoted missionary; but we are not without hopes that at some
future day a brief memoir shall be issued of one who was so earnest in her
work, and who, under God, did so much to render the labors of her brother
efficient in winning souls.</p>
<blockquote>MY DEAR MRS. LUTHER,--My first acquaintance with Miss Vinton
commenced on mission ground at Maulmain, in April, 1842. I know little of her
history previous to that time, except that she completed her school education,
but a short time previous to her going out to Burmah, at the Charlestown Female
Seminary, Charlestown, Mass. Miss Whiting, the honored and beloved principal of
that institution, was her regular correspondent. I was often privileged to read
Miss Whiting's letters, which showed that she both held her former pupil in
high esteem and cherished for her the tenderest affection.<br>
<br>
On our arrival in Maulmain, the Judsons, Howards, and Osgoods were waiting on
the shore, ready to give us a hearty welcome; but as Mr. Binney was to be
associated more intimately with your father, who was then the only Karen
missionary at Maulmain, he naturally inquired for "Brother and Sister Vinton."
He was told that they and "Sister Miranda" were at Ko-Chet Thaing's, where they
had been holding a protracted meeting, and that the Lord was so richly blessing
their labors that they had not thought it right to leave, even to greet us on
our arrival. They thought, however, the heat was becoming so intense, and the
season so far advanced, that they could not remain much longer in the jungle.
"And who is sister Miranda?" was our first question. Dr. Judson replied, "She
is brother Vinton's sister, who has been with him in his work now about three
years,--a noble worker, and will be a charming associate for you, Mrs. Binney.
I congratulate you upon having her so intimately connected with you in your
future work."<br>
<br>
I was, of course, prepared by such a commendation to love her. The next morning
as brother Howard, at whose house we were staying for a few days, was calling
his family and guests together for their usual family worship, Miss Vinton,
without previous announcement, made her appearance in our midst. The children
rushed to embrace and kiss her, and Mr. and Mrs. Howard showed unmistakable
signs of joy at her unexpected presence. My first impression, while this was
going on, was one of disappointment. She was not the ideal woman I had formed;
but a moment after, when we were introduced and she embraced me, too full of
emotion to attempt to speak, I took her into my inmost heart, from which duress
she never was able to escape.<br>
<br>
The following year she continued to work in connection with your parents.
During the rains she continued to teach in the large Karen school, which was
composed of "old men and maidens, young men and children,"--even mothers with
infants in their arms were there,--all gathered from the different villages of
the district. Most of these pupils were converts from heathenism; others,
though not as yet baptized, had taken the first step in the right direction by
coming to a Christian school to learn to read the word of God, and rarely went
back to heathenism.<br>
<br>
The Karens had no written language until a short time before Miss Vinton
entered on her work, but we found her speaking and writing it with fluency and
accuracy. She had learned it, as all children learn their native tongue, by
hearing and speaking. She mingled with the people, and was "one of them" in
sympathy and interest; and she soon was able to express her sympathy and
interest in intelligible language. I had not the ability to acquire the
language so readily in that way, and said to her one day, "How am I ever to
learn this language without a good grammar? Now, here is this word, <i>bah:</i>
sometimes it is a prefix, and seems to be used as a sign of the imperative;
more frequently an affix, and indicates a negative; sometimes it is used
singly, and sometimes repeated without any obvious reason. By what rule or
rules am I to be governed in its use?" After thinking a moment, she laughingly
said that she had never thought about any rule. Now that I had drawn her
attention to it, it did look very much as if the Karens stuck it in here and
there at random; but she supposed, when Dr. Mason's grammar was completed, he
would show us how and where to use it. She was quite content, however, to go on
using it without troubling herself about the rules; and probably few
missionaries ever used it more correctly.<br>
<br>
She knew the spiritual state of every man, woman, and child in the school, and
felt a personal interest in each. Like Miss Whiting, under whose influence she
had been while preparing for her work, she conversed with, and prayed with and
for, every pupil individually. The influence she exerted over the people
generally, not only in the schools but in the churches, and in bringing the
heathen to Christ, was something wonderful. In all this she never forgot her
proper relation to them, as is sometimes seen in similar cases, so that undue
"familiarity breeds contempt." Always cheerful and kind, yet dignified, she
walked before them without reproach, setting an example safe for all to
imitate.<br>
<br>
Though so thoroughly engrossed in her own work, she seldom failed to run over,
several times a day, to see me a moment, and often to help me. She had the rare
gift of being on hand when she could be useful, and yet never officiously in
one's way. She had been in the country long enough to be of essential service
to us in many ways.<br>
<br>
The third year, I think, of our being in Maulmain, your mother's failing health
required your parents' return to America. The Maulmain Normal School was then
well established, and Mr. Binney invited Miss Vinton to come to us and assist
in the school. A room for her use was added to our small house, and she became
a member of our family. It was a great trial to her at first to give up her
loved jungle work; but, as Mr. Binney had taken charge of the churches during
her brother's absence, it was thought best that I should accompany him in his
dry season trips, and she remain in town. She soon became intensely interested
in her work in that school, which we considered an <i>embryo college</i>. She
was a good teacher and a good disciplinarian. The school was taught through the
medium of the English language, using English text-books only; but here free
use of the vernacular enabled her to make these well understood. She translated
one or two elementary books, mostly for the use of the district schools, and
some beautiful hymns; but she never gave much attention to that department of
mission work. At the same time that she was teaching in the Normal School, she
received all visitors from the jungle who came to town, either on business or
for religious inquiry. She labored earnestly for the salvation of souls, and
many souls were given for her hire.<br>
<br>
When the Normal School was abandoned by the decision of the Executive
Committee, influenced by "the deputation" they had sent to Burmah to banish the
use of the English language from all their mission schools, she returned to her
former work. Though she would have saved the school at any personal sacrifice,
she wisely judged that the responsibility rested on the brethren of the mission
and the Executive Committee; and she lost no time in vain regrets or
controversy, but cheerfully and without complaint, followed the leadings of
Divine Providence.<br>
<br>
About the year 1854 she came home, for the first time, to visit her aged
parents and other friends. Though not actually ill, she needed rest; but she
obtained but little in a sea voyage around the Cape, and having in her charge
three or four motherless children. Her health suffered somewhat by the voyage;
but she soon rallied, and was everywhere received with regard and affection.
She was quiet, and did little in public, but everywhere produced the sweetest
impressions in behalf of the mission cause in general, and her own work in
particular, in private circles. Had her visit been made in this day, when
woman's work is bringing together larger numbers, her work would doubtless have
been more widely known, and her influence have extended to a larger circle.<br>
<br>
In June, 1854, she made us a visit in Washington, D.C. She was present, and
listened to Dr. Binney's inaugural address, on entering on his duties as
president of Columbia College. To a gentleman who had said to her, that, if her
acquaintance with Dr. Binney had been confined to the mission work she must be
somewhat surprised by the character of his address, "By no means," she replied.
"I have heard Dr. Binney, for weeks in succession, preach in Karen; and I have
always deemed his simple, clear, and moving manner of presenting Bible truths
to so ignorant a people, as requiring a higher order of talent than his address
to-day. Indeed," she added, "I have not enjoyed his address as I should have
done, had I not been thinking how much the labor and ability bestowed upon it
were needed in his former field of labor among the Karens."--"And would you
have him return to it?"--"Most certainly: I should rejoice in his return. There
are men enough to take this place, who are probably envying him his call to it,
while no one can or will take his place in Burmah." Thus she magnified her
office. There was nothing paramount with her to obedience to her Lord's last
command.<br>
<br>
Soon after her return to Burmah, she was united in marriage to Rev. Norman
Harris of the Karen Mission at Shway-Geen. At that station little had been done
for women distinctively, and the timid women and girls flocked around her at
once. She drew them to her like a magnet, and entered into this new work with
all her heart. She had been home and was rested. She had the inspiration of an
earnest and strong worker at her side, who assisted and encouraged her in all
her plans, and who fully appreciated, not only her work, but <i>her</i>. His
love and appreciation helped her to seek more earnestly how she might "please
the Lord." But whether her labors were too exhausting, or the climate
unfavorable, or both united, in less than four months after her marriage she
was taken ill of fever, which in a few days terminated fatally. Her heavenly
Bridegroom called for her, and she left us.<br>
<br>
Not only the heart of her husband, but every heart in the mission circle, was
pierced with a great sorrow. The event was as mysterious as unexpected. In the
midst of life and health, of great usefulness and happiness as well, she was
called away. But a short time before her illness, she had said to a friend that
she had never before supposed it possible that so much happiness could have
been crowded into three short months. But to the eye of faith the vision
extends to the heavenly felicity, to a higher service and to a purer love.<br>
<br>
Perhaps her character has been sufficiently delineated by her work; but I
cannot refrain from adding a few words, which I am sure will meet with a hearty
assent from those of her missionary associates who survive her.<br>
<br>
She possessed rare executive ability, rare physical health and strength, and a
cheerful, unselfish constitutional temperament; while her piety, and
consecration of all to the Master's service, have rarely been excelled. Her
"meat and drink was to do the will of Him who sent her." Not possessed of a
remarkably handsome face or figure while at rest, yet her face always brought
pleasure to the beholder, and her presence was a benediction.<br>
<br>
JULIETTE P. BINNEY.</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Stevens writes, under date of May 14, 1880, as follows:--</p>
<blockquote>MY DEAR MRS. LUTHER,--The other day Mrs. Bennett mentioned to me
your letter, requesting her to give you some reminiscences of your Aunt
Miranda. Mrs. Bennett is quite unable to write, and she asks me to say a little
to you about our high appreciation of her amiability and usefulness. Her life
was quiet, yet ever busy in earnest, unselfish work for the Karens whom she
loved, and by whom she was most beloved in return. She sought no notice nor
admiration; yet one could not but give both as she pursued the even tenor of
her cheerful way, always thinking of some one other than herself.<br>
<br>
She came out quite young,--only twenty,--vigorous, happy, and consecrated to
the work among the Karens. Her face was always radiant with kindness,
cordiality, earnestness of purpose, and sincerity. The picture is very vivid in
my memory; and her voice, too, I can hear. Not only was <i>that</i> constantly
useful in teaching, but in helping in singing Christian hymns, many of which
she translated into Karen. Another thing I may say of her voice,--I never heard
it used to the injury of others. In respect to this rare excellence she had her
reward, for I do not remember an unkind word spoken of her. She was universally
spoken of in terms of esteem by all who were familiar with her daily life for
twelve years among us. Six months previous to the time when Shway-gyeen fever
took her prematurely from her new home, she was married to the Rev. Norman
Harris. I cannot to this day see how it could be wise to remove one such as she
had been, and promised yet to be for many years, while yet in the full vigor of
cheerful usefulness, from a sphere where she was so much needed; but we know it
was wise in the eyes of Him "who doeth all things well."<br>
<br>
ELIZABETH L. STEVENS.</blockquote>
<p>Her reward is in heaven. Long years ago has she known the fulness of God's
love for his redeemed ones. In the light of the Celestial City, the dark hours
of earth have all been forgotten; but not forgotten are the tender and loving
and patient ones who toiled with her on earth, and who yet speak of her with an
uplifted eye and quivering lip.</p>
<p>Let us bless God for the re-unions which await us in heaven.</p>
<p>"ALMIGHTY GOD, with whom do live the spirits of those who depart hence in
the Lord, and with whom the souls of the faithful after they are delivered from
the burden of the flesh are in joy and felicity, we give thee hearty thanks for
the good examples of all those, thy servants, who, having finished their course
in faith, do now rest from their labors. And we beseech thee that we, with all
those who are departed in the true faith of thy Holy Name, may have our perfect
consummation and bliss, both in body and soul, in thy eternal and everlasting
glory, through Jesus Christ our Lord. AMEN."</p>
