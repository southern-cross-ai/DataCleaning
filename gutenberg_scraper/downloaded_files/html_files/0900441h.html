  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">I.&mdash;THE REVIVAL OF COBBETT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">This chapter is here called 'The Revival of Cobbett.' As
  originally planned, only a little while ago, it was to have been called 'The
  Neglect of Cobbett.' It is not unimportant to realise how recent has been the
  change. It is but a year or two ago that I had the great and (it is to be
  feared) the undeserved honour of reading a paper an the subject to the Royal
  Society of Literature on my admission to that body, which certainly consists
  almost entirely of men who know much more about literature than I do. It was
  a graceful formality on such an occasion for the least learned person in the
  room to lecture to all the rest. Yet on that occasion the chairman, who was
  much more of a literary expert than I am, re-marked on my having chosen an
  obscure and largely forgotten writer, just as if I had been lecturing on one
  of the last and least of the Greek sophists, or one of the numberless and
  nameless lyrists among the Cavaliers. Between then and now the change from
  neglect to revival has taken place. It is true that it is not until the first
  beginnings of the revival that we ever even hear of the neglect. Until that
  moment even the neglect is neglected. When I delivered the highly amateur
  address in question, the memory was already stirring, in others besides
  myself. But it is not out of egotism that I give this example; but because it
  happens to illustrate the first fact to be realised about the present
  position of Cobbett.</p>

  <p>In one sense, of course, Cobbett has never been neglected. He has only
  been admired in the way in which he would have specially hated to be admired.
  He who was full of his subject has been valued only for his style. He who was
  so stuffed with matter has been admired for his manner; though not perhaps
  for his manners. He shouted to the uproarious many, and his voice in a faint
  whisper has reached the refined few; who delicately applauded a turn of
  diction or a flight of syntax. But if such applause be rather disconcerting
  to the demagogue, the real revival of his demagogy would be even more
  disconcerting to the academic admirer. Now I mean by the revival of Cobbett
  the revival of the things that Cobbett wished to revive. They were things
  which until a little while ago nobody imagined there was the slightest chance
  of reviving; such as liberty, England, the family, the honour of the yeoman,
  and so on. Many of the learned who, on the occasion above mentioned, were
  very indulgent to my own eccentric enthusiasm, would even now be a little
  puzzled if that enthusiasm became something more than an eccentricity.
  Cobbett had been for them a man who praised an extravagant and impossible
  England in exact and excellent English. It must seem strange indeed that one
  who can never hope to write such English can yet hope to see such an England.
  The critics must feel like cultivated gentlemen who, after long relishing
  Jeremy Taylor's diction, should abruptly receive an unwelcome invitation to
  give an exhibition of Holy Dying. They must feel like scholars who should
  have lingered lovingly all their lives over the lapidary Babylonian jests and
  vast verbal incantations of the wonderful essay on Urn-Burial; and then have
  lived to see it sold by the hundred as the popular pamphlet of a bustling
  modern movement in favour of cremation.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, this classic preservation of Cobbett in an urn, in the form
  of ashes, has not been quite consistent with itself. Even now it would seem
  that the ashes were still a little too hot to touch. And I only mentioned my
  own little effort in academic lecturing because it concerned something that
  may be repeated here, as relevant to the first essentials of the subject.
  Many professors have in a merely literary sense recognised Cobbett as a
  model; but few have modelled themselves upon their model. They were always
  ready to hope that their pupils would write such good English. But they would
  have been mildly surprised if any pupil had written such plain English. Yet,
  as I pointed out on that occasion, the strongest quality of Cobbett as a
  stylist is in the use he made of a certain kind of language; the sort of use
  commonly called abuse. It is especially his bad language that is always good.
  It is precisely the passages that have always been recognised as good style
  that would now be regarded as bad form. And it is precisely these violent
  passages that especially bring out not only the best capacities of Cobbett
  but also the best capacities of English. I was and am therefore ready to
  repeat what I said in my little lecture, and to repeat it quite seriously,
  though it was the subject at the time of merely amused comment. I pointed out
  that in the formation of the noble and beautiful English language, out of so
  many local elements, nothing had emerged more truly beautiful than the sort
  of English that has been localised under the name of Billingsgate. I pointed
  out that English excels in certain angular consonants and abrupt terminations
  that make it extraordinarily effective for the expression of the fighting
  spirit and a fierce contempt. How fortunate is the condition of the
  Englishman who can kick people; and how relatively melancholy that of the
  Frenchman who can only give them a blow of the foot! If we say that two
  people fight like cat and dog, the very words seem to have in them a shindy
  of snaps and screams and scratches. If we say 'comme le chat et le chien,' we
  are depressed with the suggestion of comparative peace. French has of course
  its own depths of resounding power: but not this sort of battering ram of
  bathos. Now nobody denies that Cobbett and his enemies did fight like cat and
  dog, but it is precisely his fighting passages that contain some of the
  finest examples of a style as English as the word dog or the word cat. So far
  as this goes the point has nothing to do with political or moral sympathy
  with Cobbett's cause. The beauty of his incessant abuse is a matter of art
  for art's sake. The pleasure which an educated taste would receive in hearing
  Cobbett call a duchess an old eat or a bishop a dirty dog is almost
  onomatopoeic, in its love of a melody all but detached from meaning. In
  saying this, it might be supposed, I was indeed meeting the purely artistic
  and academic critic half way, and might well have been welcomed, so to speak,
  with an embrace of reconciliation. This is indeed the reason why most lovers
  of English letters have at least kept alive a purely literary tradition of
  Cobbett. But, as it happened, I added some words which I will also take the
  liberty of mentioning, because they exactly illustrate the stages of this
  re-emergence of the great writer's fame from the field of literature to the
  field of life. 'There is a serious danger that this charm in English
  literature may be lost. The comparative absence of abuse in social and
  senatorial life may take away one of the beauties of our beautiful and
  historic speech. Words like "scamp" and "scoundrel," which have the unique
  strength of English in them, are likely to grow unfamiliar through lack of
  use, though certainly not through lack of opportunity for use. It is indeed
  strange that when public life presents so wide and promising a field for the
  use of these terms, they should be suffered to drop into desuetude. It seems
  singular that when the careers of our public men, the character of our
  commercial triumphs, and the general culture and ethic of the modern world
  seem so specially to invite and, as it were, to cry aloud for the use of such
  language, the secret of such language should be in danger of being lost.'
  Now, when I drew the attention of those authoritative guardians of English
  literature, responsible for the preservation of the purity of the English
  language, to this deplorable state of things&mdash;to the words that are like
  weapons rusting on the wall, to the most choice terms of abuse becoming
  obsolete in face of rich and even bewildering opportunities in the way of
  public persons to apply them to&mdash;when I appealed against this neglect
of our
  noble tongue, I am sorry to say that my appeal was received with heartless
  laughter and was genially criticised in the newspapers as a joke. It was
  regarded not only as a piece of mild buffoonery but as a sort of
  eighteenth-century masquerade; as if I only wished to bring back cudgels and
  cutlasses along with wigs and three-cornered hats. It was assumed that nobody
  could possibly seriously hope, or even seriously expect, to hear again the
  old Billingsgate of the hustings and the election fight. And yet, since those
  criticisms were written, only a very little time ago, that sort of very Early
  English has suddenly been heard, if not in journalism, at least in politics.
  By a strange paradox, even the House of Commons has heard the sound of common
  speech, not wholly unconnected with common sense. Labour members and young
  Tories have both been heard talking like men in the street. Mr. Jack Jones,
  by his interruptions, has made himself a judicious patron of this literary
  revival, this attempt to save the heritage of English culture; and Mr.
  Kirkwood has said things about capitalists of which even Cobbett might be
  proud.</p>

  <p>Now, I have only mentioned my premature lament over the bargee, that
  disreputable Tom Bowling, because it serves to introduce a certain equally
  premature rejoicing which explains much of our present position. The
  Victorian critics had insisted on regarding the violence of Cobbett as
  entirely a thing of the past; with the result that they find themselves
  suddenly threatened with that sort of violence advancing on them from the
  future. They are perhaps a little alarmed; and at least they are very
  naturally puzzled. They had always been taught that Cobbett was a crank whose
  theories had been thrashed out long ago and found to be quite empty and
  fallacious. He had been preserved only for his style; and even that was rude
  and old-fashioned, especially in the quaint Saxon archaism of calling a spade
  a spade. They little thought to have heard the horrid sound, the hideous word
  'spade' itself, shake the arches of St. Stephen's as with a blasphemy. But
  the question is not merely one of idioms but of ideas. They had always
  supposed at least that Cobbett's ideas were exploded; and they found they
  were still exploding. They found that the explosion which missed fire a
  hundred years ago, like that of Guy Fawkes three hundred years ago, still has
  a time fuse whose time was not quite expired; and that the location of the
  peril (I regret to say) was also not very far from the same spot as Guy
  Fawkes's. In a peril of that sort it is very important to understand what is
  really happening; and I doubt if the comfortable classes understand what is
  happening much better than they did in Cobbett's day&mdash;to say nothing of
Guy
  Fawkes's. And one reason why I originally agreed to write this little book,
  is that I think it a matter of life and death that it should be
  understood.</p>

  <p>The cudgel has come back like a boomerang: and the common Englishman, so
  long content with taking half a loaf, may yet in the same tradition of
  compromise confine himself to heaving half a brick. The reason why
  Parliamentary language is unparliamentary and Westminster has been joined to
  Billingsgate, the reason why the English poor in many places are no longer
  grumbling or even growling but rather howling, the reason why there is a new
  note in our old polite politics, is a reason that vitally concerns the
  subject of this little study. There are a great many ways of stating that
  reason; but the way most relevant here is this. All this is happening because
  the critics have been all wrong about Cobbett. I mean they were specially
  wrong about what he represented. It is happening because Cobbett was not what
  they have always represented him as being; not even what they have always
  praised him as being. It is happening because Cobbett stood for a reality of
  quite another sort; and realities can return whether we understand them or
  not. Cobbett was not merely a wrong-headed fellow with a knack of saying the
  right word about the wrong thing. Cobbett was not merely an angry and
  antiquated old farmer who thought the country must be going to the dogs
  because the whole world was not given up to the cows. Cobbett was not merely
  a man with a lot of nonsensical notions that could be exploded by political
  economy; a man looking to turn England into an Eden that should grow nothing
  but Cobbett's Corn. What he saw was not an Eden that cannot exist but rather
  an Inferno that can exist, and even that does exist. What he saw was the
  perishing of the whole English power of self-support, the growth of cities
  that drain and dry up the countryside, the growth of dense dependent
  populations incapable of finding their own food, the toppling triumph of
  machines over men, the sprawling omnipotence of financiers over patriots, the
  herding of humanity in nomadic masses whose very homes are homeless, the
  terrible necessity of peace and the terrible probability of war, all the
  loading up of our little island like a sinking ship; the wealth that may mean
  famine and the culture that may mean despair; the bread of Midas and the
  sword of Damocles. In a word, he saw what we see, but he saw it when it was
  not there. And some cannot see it&mdash;even when it is there.</p>

  <p>It is the paradox of his life that he loved the past, and he alone really
  lived in the future. That is, he alone lived in the real future. The future
  was a fog, as it always is; and in some ways his largely instinctive
  intelligence was foggy enough about it. But he and he alone had some notion
  of the sort of London fog that it was going to be. He was in France during
  the French Revolution; amid all that world of carnage and classical
  quotations, of Greek names and very Latin riots. He must have looked, as he
  stood there with his big heavy figure and black beaver hat, as solemn and
  solid a specimen as ever was seen of the Englishman abroad&mdash;the sort of
  Englishman who is very much abroad. He went to America just after the
  American Revolution; and played the part of the old Tory farmer, waving the
  beaver hat and calling on those astonished republicans for three cheers for
  King George. Everywhere, amid all that dance of humanitarian hopes, he seemed
  like a survival and a relic of times gone by. And he alone was in any living
  touch with the times that were to come.</p>

  <p>All those reformers and revolutionists around him, talking hopefully of
  the future, were without exception living in the past. The very future they
  happily prophesied was the future as it would have been in the past. Some
  were dreaming of a remote and some of a recent past; some of a true and some
  of a false past; some of a heroic past and others of a past more dubious. But
  they all meant by their ideal democracy what democracy would have been in a
  simpler age than their own. The French republicans were living in the lost
  republics of the Mediterranean; in the cold volcanoes of Athens and Thebes.
  Theirs was a great ideal; but no modern state is small enough to achieve
  anything so great. We might say that some of those eighteenth century
  progressives had even got so far as the reign of Pepin or Dagobert, and
  discovered the existence of the French Monarchy. For things so genuine and
  primarily so popular as the French Monarchy are generally not really
  discovered until they have existed for some time; and when they are
  discovered they are generally destroyed. The English and to some extent the
  American liberals were living in one sense even more in the past; for they
  were not destroying what had recently been discovered. They were destroying
  what had recently been destroyed. The Americans were defying George the
  Third, under the extraordinary idea that George the Third ruled England. When
  they set up their republic, the simple colonists probably really did think
  that England was a monarchy. The same illusion filled the English Whigs; but
  it was only because England had once been a monarchy. The Whigs were engaged
  permanently in expelling the Stuarts, an enjoyable occupation that could be
  indefinitely repeated. They were always fighting the battles of Naseby and
  Newbury over again, and defying a divine right that nobody was defending. For
  them indeed Charles the First walked and talked half an hour, or half a
  century, or a century and a half, after his head was cut off and they
  themselves could walk nowhere but in Whitehall, and talk of nothing but what
  happened there. We can see how that long tradition lingered in a light and
  popular book like Dickens's Child's History of England; and how even the
  child was still summoned to take part in that retrospective revolution. For
  there were moments when even Mr. Dickens had the same obsession as Mr.
  Dick.</p>

  <p>But the point is that these idealists&mdash;most of them very noble
  idealists&mdash;all saw the future upon the simple pattern of the past. It is
  typical that the American band of comrades were called the Cincinnati, and
  were named after Cincinnatus the Consul who threw away the toga to take the
  plough. But Cobbett knew a little more about ploughing. He knew the
  ploughshare had stuck in a stiff furrow; and he knew as nobody else knew upon
  what sort of stone it had struck. He knew that stone was the metal out of
  which the whole modern world would be made; unless the operation could be
  stopped in time. He knew it indeed only blindly and instinctively; but nobody
  else knew it at all. Nobody else had felt the future; nobody else had smelt
  the fog; nobody else had any notion of what was really coming upon the
  world.</p>

  <p>I mean that if you had gone to Jefferson at the moment when he was writing
  the Declaration of Independence, and shown him the exact picture of an Oil
  Trust, and its present position in America, he would have said, 'It is not to
  be believed.' If you had gone to Cobbett, and shown him the same thing, he
  would have said, like the bearded old gentleman in the rhyme, 'It is just as
  I feared.' If you had confronted Carnot with Caillaux, the old revolutionist
  would have wondered what inconceivable curse could have fallen on great
  France of the soldiers. If you had confronted Cobbett with some of our
  similar specimens, he would have said it was what might be expected when you
  gave over great England to the stockjobbers. For men like Jefferson and
  Carnot were thinking of an ancient agricultural society merely changing from
  inequality to equality. They were thinking of Greek and Roman villages in
  which democracy had driven out oligarchy. They were thinking of a medieval
  manor that had become a medieval commune. The merchant and man of affairs was
  a small and harmless by-product of their system; they had no notion that it
  would grow large enough to swallow all the rest. The point about Cobbett is
  that he alone really knew that there and not in kings or republics, Jacobins
  or Anti-Jacobins, lay the peril and oppression of the times to come.</p>

  <p>It is the riddle of the man that if he was wrong then, he is right now. As
  a dead man fighting with dead men, he can still very easily be covered with
  derision; but if we imagine him still alive and talking to living men, his
  remarks are rather uncomfortably like life. The very words that we should
  once have read as the most faded and antiquated history can now be read as
  the most startling and topical journalism. Let it be granted that the
  denunciation was not always correct about Dr. Priestley or Dr. Rush, that the
  abuse was not really applicable to Mr. Hunt or Mr. Wright; let us console
  ourselves with the fact that the abuse is quite applicable to us. We at least
  have done all that Cobbett's enemies were accused of doing. We have fulfilled
  all those wild prophecies; we have justified all those most unjustifiable
  aspersions; we have come into the world as if to embody and fulfill in a
  belated fashion that highly improbable prediction. Cobbett's enemies may or
  may not have ruined agriculture; but anyhow we have. Cobbett's contemporaries
  may or may not have decreased the national wealth, but it is decreased. Paper
  money may not have driven out gold in his lifetime, but we have been more
  privileged than he. In a mere quarrel between the eighteenth century and the
  nineteenth century he may easily appear wrong; but in a quarrel between the
  nineteenth century and the twentieth century he is right. He did not always
  draw precise diagrams of things as they were. He only had frantic and
  fantastic nightmares of things as they are. The fame of Cobbett faded and
  indeed completely vanished during our time of prosperity or what is counted
  our time of prosperity. For in fact it was only the prosperity of the
  prosperous. But during all that time his version of the doubts about what
  Carlyle called the profit-and-loss philosophy practically disappeared from
  the modern mind. I have mentioned Carlyle but as expressed by Carlyle the
  same doubts were not the same thing. Carlyle would have turned capitalism
  into a sort of feudalism, with the feudal loyalty on the one side and the
  feudal liberality on the other. He meant by the profit-and-loss philosophy a
  small and mean philosophy that could not face a small loss even for the sake
  of a great profit. But he never denied that there could be a great profit, he
  never contradicted the whole trend of the age as Cobbett did. On the
  contrary, Carlyle called the capitalist by a romantic name, where Cobbett
  would have called him by a shockingly realistic name. Carlyle called the
  capitalist a captain of industry, a very sad scrap of Victorian
  sentimentalism. That romantic evasion misses the whole point, the point that
  Cobbett kept steadily in sight all his life. Militarism would be much less
  respectable and respected if the captain of a line regiment had pocketed the
  rent of every acre that he fought for in Flanders. Capitalism would be much
  more respectable and respected if all the master builders climbed to the tops
  of towers and fell off, if there were as many capitalists knocked on the head
  by bricks as there were captains killed at the front by bullets. But as I
  pointed out in a connection already mentioned, Carlyle was really rather an
  optimist than a pessimist. Certainly Carlyle was an optimist where Cobbett
  was a pessimist. Cobbett dug much deeper; he not only called a spade a spade,
  but he used it like a resurrectionist&mdash;not merely like a reformer
weeding out
  small evils. We might say that the mere reformer calls a spade a spud.
  Carlyle gave hints and suggestions rather darkly that the whole business
  might end badly; but he never really dared to wish that it had never begun.
  He told the rich sternly how they should dispose of their wealth, he did not,
  like Cobbett, tell them coarsely how they had collected it. The consequence
  was that Carlyle has been exhibited as a Puritan, a pessimist, a prophet of
  woe. Cobbett has not been exhibited at all. Carlyle has been set over against
  Mill and Macaulay as a sort of official opposition, but Cobbett's opposition
  was not sufficiently official. Carlyle has been allowed to grumble like a
  choleric old major much respected in the club. Cobbett has been entirely
  removed, like the enfant terrible, kicking and screaming, lest he should say
  something dreadful in the drawing room. Hence the big secret with which he
  was bursting has actually been too big to be uttered; his condemnation was so
  large and sweeping that it had to be hidden in a hole. The Victorians were
  quite cultivated enough and broad-minded enough to realise that there must be
  some reminder amid their rejoicings of human fallibility and frailty; lest
  Mr. George Augustus Sala should seem a creature all too bright and good for
  human nature's daily food. They had something of the imperial imagination and
  philosophic outlook of the ancient Egyptians, who set a skeleton at the
  banquet to remind them of mortality and a more melancholy mood that might
  mingle harmlessly with the mood of joy. Carlyle was the skeleton of the
  feast. But Cobbett was not the skeleton of the feast; he was the skeleton in
  the cupboard.</p>

  <p>In short, Carlyle did criticise the profit-and-loss school, but not the
  profitableness of the whole world in which it was made. Certainly he did not
  question the assumption that it was at least profitable in the sense of being
  practicable. But since then deeper forces have moved and darker riddles begun
  to be murmured amongst us; and it is not the superficial abnormalities and
  accidents but the whole main movement and purpose of the nineteenth century
  that is brought in question. We have come back to doing what Carlyle never
  really did, what Cobbett always wanted to do, to make a real reckoning of
  ultimate loss and profit on the profit-and-loss philosophy. Even in the
  economic sphere the answer has been looking more and more doubtful. We talk
  of it as the age of profiteers; but it is a question how long even profiteers
  will make profits. We talk of it as capitalism; and so it is, in the rather
  sinister sense of living on capital.</p>

  <p>So in some old romance of some old manor-house and manorial family there
  might come a dark hour in its annals and a dark cloud upon its towers (a
  thunderstorm thrown in, or the fall of some shield or picture or garden
  statue or anything necessary to the novelist's taste in doom); and through
  the darkened halls and corridors the master of the house would pass to some
  dim disordered library and take down some forbidden or neglected volume, in
  which are traced strange emblems or figures or maps or charts of hidden
  things, or forgotten runes and riddles returning only with the end. So the
  Englishman of the twentieth century is to-day groping his way back past all
  the literature of the nineteenth; past all the varied Victorian romances of
  fashionable progress in Macaulay and fashionable reaction in Carlyle; till he
  finds far up on a high shelf the old thick, leather-bound volumes, with faded
  print and the barely decipherable title of 'Cobbett's Register'; and taking
  down the book, amid the gathering storm and the growing darkness, reads this
  old story.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">II.&mdash;A SELF-MADE MAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It is now rather more than a century and a half since a
  small boy of the poorer sort was occupied in scaring rooks where they rose,
  as they still rise, in black flotillas flecking the great white clouds that
  roll up against the great ridges of Surrey and the southern shires. Yet
  further south where the Sussex hills take on an outline at once more opulent
  and more bare there was repeated a rhyme that might run like a refrain
  through much of his story.</p>

  <p>Bees are bees of Paradise, Do the work of Jesus Christ, Do the work that
  no man can; God made bees and bees make honey, God made man and man makes
  money, God made man to plough and reap and sow, And God made little boys to
  scare away the crow.</p>

  <p>And so the little boy in question continued to scare away the crow, in
  obedience to that providential arrangement.</p>

  <p>The little boy was destined to grow up into a tall and vigorous man, who
  was to travel far and into strange places, into exile and into prison and
  into Parliament; but his heart never wandered very far from the simple ideals
  that are summed up in that verse. He was no mere dreamer or more or less
  lovable loafer, of the sort sometimes associated with the village genius. He
  would have been as ready as any man of the utilitarian school to admit that
  men would do well to imitate the industry of bees. Only, those who look at
  his literary industry may be tempted to say that he had more sting than
  honey. Similarly he was no mere romantic or sentimentalist, such as is
  sometimes associated with a love of the rural scene. He would have been as
  ready as any merchant or trader to face the fact that man, as God has made
  him, must make money. But he had a vivid sense that the money must be as
  solid and honest as the corn and fruit for which it stood, that it must be
  closely in touch with the realities that it represented; and he waged a
  furious war on all those indirect and sometimes imaginary processes of debts
  and shares and promises and percentages which make the world of wealth to-day
  a world at the worst unreal and at the best unseen. He was most immediately
  concerned, in the conditions of the hour, with what he regarded as the
  fugitive and wasteful paper-chase of paper money. But what he was at once
  predicting and denouncing, like a small cloud that had not yet become a
  universal fog, was that vast legal fiction that we call finance. In any case,
  against a world in which such financial mysteries were multiplying every day,
  in which machinery was everywhere on the march, and the new towns spreading
  with the swiftness of a landslide, in which England was already well on the
  way to becoming merely the workshop of the world, against the whole great
  crawling labyrinth of the modern state which is almost one with the modern
  city, there remained in him unaltered, cut deep into the solitary rock of his
  soul, the single clause of his single creed: that God made man to plough and
  reap and sow.</p>

  <p>For this was William Cobbett, who was born in 1762 at a little farm at
  Farnham in Surrey. His grandfather had been an ordinary agricultural
  labourer, one of a class drudging for a miserable wage, and fallen so far
  from anything resembling the pride of a peasantry that in English history it
  had utterly sunk out of sight. It was something that has hardly been known
  since heathen times; there rests on all its records the ancient silence of
  slavery. It was to these slaves that the heart of Cobbett continually turned,
  in what seemed to many its dizzy and incalculable turnings. Those that were
  trampled and forgotten alike by the Tory squire and the Radical merchant were
  those whom Cobbett eared to remember; exactly as both Patrician and Plebeian
  citizens might have been puzzled by a sage whose first thought was of the
  slaves. And if ever in this land of ours the poor are truly lifted up, if
  ever the really needy find a tongue for their own needs, if ever progressives
  and reactionaries alike realise upon what ruins were built both their order
  and their reform, how many failures went to make their success, and what
  crimes have set their house in order, if they see the underside of their own
  history with its secrets of sealed-up wrath and irrevocable
injustice&mdash;in a
  word, if a great people can ever repent, then posterity may see achieved by
  this agency also, by this one lonely and angry bee in whom society saw
  nothing but a hornet, the work of Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p>His father was a small farmer and evidently no fool; but the son could
  have but a very rudimentary and rustic schooling. The son was perhaps all his
  life' a little too prone to play the schoolmaster; and from an early age he
  played the schoolmaster to himself. We have many notes of his first reading;
  notably a glimpse which shows him gaping at the broad farcical title of 'The
  Tale of a Tub,' so much in his own verbal fashion, and buying it and trying
  to understand it. He read it under a haystack, and it was so that there fell
  across him in his first sunshine the shadow of that dark but not ignoble
  spirit who a hundred years before had seen the first victory of our Venetian
  oligarchy and despaired. For many have discussed whether Cobbett owed
  anything to Swift's style, but few have sufficiently considered his
  connection with Swift's cause or creed. Anyhow, precious little of either
  could have been made out by a farmer's boy reading 'The Tale of a Tub' under
  a haystack. For the rest, there is something of the boy's adventure story
  running through his boyhood. He embodied the recognised romance of England by
  running away to sea. He also embodied his own rather recurrent and fitful
  sagacity by running back again.</p>

  <p>He was a character from his earliest years. There was a sort of calm
  impetuosity about his movements. He set out one day to escort some girls to
  the village fair, dressed up in all his village finery. He saw a coach with
  'London' on it, and inconsequently got on to it and went careering away,
  leaving his lady friends, his fair, his farm, and his family behind him like
  things of the past. Fortunately he met a friend of his father's in London,
  who got him a post as clerk in a lawyer's office. He hated the lawyer's
  office, as he hated lawyers and law, all his life; as he hated long words and
  pedantry and petty tyranny. He took another plunge with the same placid
  abruptness; he took the King's shilling and enlisted as a private soldier.
  Here he was more successful; for there was much more of the soldier than the
  lawyer about him. Moreover, he was none the less a country boy because he had
  played the traditional part of the country boy who comes up to London where
  the streets are paved with gold. He was tall and strong, with a stride for
  which there seemed to be no room in the narrow streets, which went with a
  better swing on the long marches over the hills and far away. His lungs,
  which in every sense played so large a part in his life, demanded the deep
  air of the open places. Fifty years afterwards, at Westminster, as lie would
  have said, he was to find himself dying in another den of lawyers. He was
  much happier anyhow in the camp of soldiers; indeed, he was not only happy
  but fortunate. He was recognised as a good soldier, and rose to be corporal
  and sergeant and eventually a sort of secretary to the whole regiment,
  assisting the adjutant. All this time he had been teaching himself grammar;
  and also (what is pleasingly characteristic) teaching the adjutant grammar.
  Anyhow it is obvious that he was trustworthy and that he was trusted. He was
  strict in his duty; rose early, an early bird ready to catch the earliest
  worm; he kept an eye on everything; he was as busy as a business man. Such a
  man generally dies rich and respected; but it is just here that there appears
  that little twist or bias which decided how William Cobbett was to live and
  die.</p>

  <p>Cobbett began to note something queer and quite wrong about the regimental
  accounts. He soon discovered that a number of officers were simply pocketing
  money meant for the regimental food. Then it was that there appeared the
  deplorable difference between Cobbett and a really respectable and successful
  man. All his life long he never could leave things alone. He was a business
  man: but he could not mind his own business. He kept an eye on things; but he
  had never learnt to wink the other eye. He was the early bird; but he fell
  into the melancholy mistake of supposing that all worms ought really to be
  treated as worms. He had not the fine instinct which makes the really
  successful secretary-bird distinguish between the earthworms of the
  underworld and the silkworms of the smart set. It is not suggested that he
  was a pure altruist, a spotless saint of patriotism; then as always his
  action involved a vast amount of vanity, of self-assertion, of sensationalism
  and crudity, also a vast amount of inconsistency and inconsequence. The point
  is that, whatever his other vices, he did not really know how to rise in the
  world. He made a scene; and discovered too late that in denouncing what he
  supposed to be a detail of individual swindling in his own regiment he had
  really challenged a system running through the whole British Army, or for
  that matter through the whole British Constitution. Where his restless
  meddling thought to let the regimental cat out of the bag, or out of one
  particular knapsack, he found he had roused from its lair a sort of Tammany
  Tiger. He was not by any means clear or consistent about it. The truth is he
  was quite out of his depth; yet he was perfectly right in feeling that there
  were depths of degradation. While he was in the Army his protest was easily
  crushed; when he had left it the Government granted some sort of enquiry; but
  as Cobbett could not get what he demanded as the conditions of that enquiry,
  he refused even to attend it himself, and the whole protest went by default.
  In a society like ours, it is very common for scandals that are too big to be
  cured to fizzle out like that, as if they were too small to be
  considered.</p>

  <p>It was while he was a soldier that lie took another of those
  characteristic steps, that might seem to many like steps over a precipice.
  But it is essential to realise about him that the very first step always had
  about it something almost stiff and automatic in its composure, however
  stormy might be the consequences or however much he might rave back against
  the storm. In this connection we must try to remember what is so entirely
  forgotten: the Stoic ideal of the end of the eighteenth century. The secular
  ideals of humanity fossilise very fast, and nothing but religion ever
  remains. Stoicism is stratified amid layers of lost moral fashions; but it
  was a fine thing in its day, when it stiffened with heathen virtues the
  Revolutionists of France and America. Our luxurious and orientalised fashions
  and fictions have a great deal to learn from the Roman virtues advocated in
  Sandford and Merton. That is why they certainly will not learn it. It must be
  admitted that in Mr. Cobbett there was a touch of Mr. Barlow. All his life he
  admired people who did things for themselves; especially if they did them
  under difficulties. He admired home-made bread or home-brewed ale even if
  some would call it the bread of affliction or consider it very bitter beer.
  Very early one morning he was going some of his military rounds in his
  sergeant's uniform, when the grey day was just breaking over fields of snow.
  He had a great power of sketching a landscape in simple words; and somehow
  such a twilight of grey and silver remains long in the reader's memory. At
  the end of a small yard he saw a girl with dark hair scouring out some pots
  and pans. He looked at her again and saw she was very beautiful. Then he said
  with a sort of fatal finality: 'That's the girl for me.' And indeed she was
  the wife who was with him when he died fifty years afterwards, on those
  Surrey hills that were his home.</p>

  <p>Another incident attaches itself to her memory which is very significant
  of Cobbett's career from its earliest days. Doubtless he had before and since
  taken many girls to fairs, or failed to take them to fairs, like those who
  must have waited wondering after the incident of the coach. But like many
  combative, objective men he was really by nature very faithful in relations
  of mere affection; and he makes us believe it by a very convincing account of
  his one serious temptation to unfaithfulness. Unfaithfulness is never so
  vivid to an unfaithful man. By the time he returned to England, it was with
  the perfectly simple and concentrated purpose of seeking out the girl he had
  seen in the snow. In the old days he had come to a sort of understanding with
  her; and had solemnly placed in her hands a sealed packet of money, telling
  her to use it whenever she was in need. Then his regiment crossed the
  Atlantic and she was lost in the labyrinth of the poverty of a modern town.
  For a long time he could find no trace; at last he tracked her to a slum
  where she was working as the poorest sort of servant; and she handed him back
  his packet of money with the seal unbroken.</p>

  <p>It is clear that for Cobbett that small gesture of repayment seemed as
  splendid as the throwing of the gauntlet. To enter into his sense of triumph
  we must understand something that is found in him through life, and
  especially found in him, when it is generally rarest, in youth. It is
  something seldom understood in a society without peasants; an oligarchy which
  can only understand what we call 'honour' as it is understood by gentlemen.
  It was the self-respect of the poor, which all modern industrial society has
  been slowly crushing to death. To find it anywhere uncrushed and even uncowed
  was to Cobbett like the noise of a great victory in a war of the world. When
  the poor servant-girl stood up and handed him back his little handful, there
  were things in it that neither snobs nor Bohemians will ever understand.
  There was at once fidelity and defiance, there was at once loyalty and
  solitude, there was a hard pride in work and a fine shade of delicacy; there
  was dignity, there was justice, above all there was triumph. Not here at
  least had the almighty meanness of the modern world prevailed, that lopped
  all lofty simplicities and lamed all lovers' quests; here was a romance
  rounded and complete and solid as the sealed packet in his hand; here in this
  unhappy world was a story with a happy ending. In all the long comedy of the
  contrast between the heart of man and its surroundings, never has there been
  a stranger disproportion than between the outside and the inside of that one
  small incident; of a young man finding his first love left alone with her
  honour and her pride. To any one passing in the street there could have been
  nothing visible but a tall and shabby soldier staring at a servant-girl on a
  door-step; but in his own narration it becomes easy to understand that she
  came back to him with all the beauty of banners.</p>

  <p>I have dwelt on this one case of the contrast between the external
  homeliness of poverty and the internal glow of its occasional festivals and
  triumphs, because this is something very near to the whole secret of the
  man's life. It was always of such small tragedies and small triumphs that he
  was thinking when he talked about the problem of poverty. He differed from
  many modern social reformers and from most modern philanthropists, in the
  fact that he was not merely concerned with what is called the welfare of the
  workers. He was very much concerned for their dignity, their good name, their
  honour, and even their glory. Any humane man may desire the well-being of his
  servants, as he may the well-being of his horses or his sheep. But he does
  not commonly expect a horse to bring back a nosebag, full of oats, to which
  the conscientious quadruped does not think himself entitled by the terms of
  the contract. He does not expect a sheep to fire up and take offence, either
  at being bribed with grass or water, or at being criticised as the black
  sheep of the flock. He does not expect the sheep to offer to fight the
  sheep-dog, when accused of running away from the wolf. In short, he does not
  expect horses and sheep to have a sense of honour; but Cobbett, always so
  eccentric and paradoxical, did really desire peasants and working-men to have
  a sense of honour. The agony of rage in which so much of his life was passed
  was due to the consciousness that this popular sense of honour was everywhere
  being broken down by a cruel and ignoble industrialism. His whole life was a
  resistance to the degradation of the poor; to their degradation in the
  literal sense of the loss of a step, of a standing, of a status. There lay on
  his mind, like a nightmare of machinery crushing and crunching millions of
  bones, all the detailed destruction of the private property and domestic
  traditions of destitute families; all the selling up and breaking up of
  furniture, all the pawning of heirlooms and keepsakes; all that is meant by
  the awful sacrifice of the wedding-ring. He thought of a thousand stories
  like the story of the servant-girl: except that these stories did not have a
  happy ending.</p>

  <p>His wife was soon to discover that if she had married (as she had) one of
  the most constant and considerate of husbands, she had also married one of
  the most restless and incalculable of men. It would be instructive to have a
  diary of Mrs. Cobbett, as well as the endless autobiographies of Mr. Cobbett.
  But she remains in the background of his life in a sort of powerful silence;
  and is known to us only by the praises that he never ceased to give her. She
  was soon called upon to go on some of his interminable travels. When he found
  in the case of Army corruption, to use one of his own homely sort of figures,
  that he had bitten off more than he could chew, he retired in disgust to
  France, and remained there through some of the most thrilling days of the
  French Revolution. Yet it is typical of him that he took with immense
  seriousness to the subject of French grammar, as a pendant to his devouring
  hobby of English grammar. When he set sail again from France it was not for
  England but for America, where he and his wife remained in exile for seven
  years. Their travels were not without their tragedies; for his first child
  died and his second was still-born, and it was not until he was more finally
  established that a living child rejoiced the most enthusiastic of fathers.
  But through all these early days we have the same vigilant activity in
  private things; as in the touching story of his striding up and down all
  night and driving away the howling dogs that his wife might sleep.</p>

  <p>But there is another moral affecting the man and his work and arising in
  this connection out of an incident like that of his courtship and marriage.
  From the start we find him standing up sternly and almost priggishly for
  ideals of thrift and self-control. He might almost have been mistaken for a
  supporter of Smiles and Self-Help, if it were not for his second phase in
  raising a riot far more reckless than that of Wilkes and Liberty. But he
  enormously strengthened his case for Liberty by being the very antithesis of
  Wilkes. He justified his riot precisely because it could not be mistaken
  merely for riotous living. No sane person could pretend that Cobbett only
  sympathised with poverty because he sympathised with profligacy; because he
  sympathised with improvidence and irresponsibility and imbecile waste. Nobody
  could say he was merely an idler sympathising with idlers, or a wastrel
  sympathising with wastrels, or a man who loved ignorance preferring those who
  were ignorant. He was not even a man like Byron or Burns, whose sincere love
  of public liberty could be confused with a love of private licence. His case
  against industrialism was immensely strengthened by the fact that he himself
  was quite cut out to be the industrious apprentice. When he said that
  thousands were not only unlucky but unjustly oppressed, he said it with the
  authority of one who might quite well have been the hundredth lucky man who
  was the only hope of industrial competition. He who was so obviously a
  self-educated man might surely have been a self-made man. At least he stood a
  better chance of it than the thousands who were told to live only for that
  remote chance. When he said that the chance was worthless he was a reasonable
  and valid witness; when he said that most men were unfairly equipped for the
  struggle, he was better equipped than most. It was a much wiser Mr. Smiles,
  himself entirely capable of self-help, who saw that the poor were really and
  truly helpless. And this second consideration comes back to the same truth as
  the first. It comes back to the fundamental truth of the modern state. Our
  commercialism does not punish the vices of the poor, but the virtues of the
  poor. It hampers the human character at its best and not merely at its worst;
  and makes impossible even the merits that it vainly recommends. Capitalism
  has prevented the poor man from saving more than it has prevented him from
  spending. It has restrained him from respectable marriage more than from
  casual immorality. It may be that Socialism threatens to destroy domesticity;
  but it is capitalism that destroys it. This is doubtless what is meant by
  saying that capitalism is the more practical of the two.</p>

  <p>Cobbett was eminently and emphatically a respectable man. He was denounced
  as a demagogue, he was thrown in prison like a felon, he was all his life in
  the midst of riot and abuse, he was regarded as the inaugurator of red ruin
  and the breaking up of laws; but he remained to the last a highly respectable
  person, in the sense that he valued what are called the respectable virtues.
  That he was respectable to the last is perhaps less remarkable than that he
  was respectable from the first; and perhaps especially respectable at the
  first. That period of youth, which is commonly excused as the irresponsible
  period, was with him by far the most responsible period. It was during that
  period that he was improving his mind, limiting his luxuries, schooling
  himself in simple habits and rising in his military profession. He married
  the girl whose independence and probity he so much admired: and he was all
  his life a model husband and father. He was respectable and he might easily
  have been respected. It is his great virtue that he preferred to be reviled.
  It is his great glory that having taken the first steps in the successful
  life as it has been lived by so many successful men, he preferred to make
  himself a mockery and a cockshy for every worldly wit or comfortable critic
  to laugh at as a failure for a hundred years. He might have been a self-made
  man; but he died unfinished, trying to make something better than
  himself.</p>

  <p>Finally, he was by nature a traditionalist and he was by tradition a Tory.
  He appeared first as a solid and loyal supporter of Church and King; and he
  appeared with complete success. As we shall see, his place was prepared for
  him as a good party man; his path was straight before him to the position of
  a great party leader. It seemed to most honest people, it seemed to him quite
  honestly, his logical and legitimate goal. It is his glory that he never
  reached his goal. It is his merit that his fallen figure was found far
  astray, and picked up, so to speak, like a dead vagabond; a puzzle for
  pedants and a sort of suicidal wreck to politicians; when he had set out on
  his journey stiff with so many strict loyalties and so many respectable
  conventions. For there dwelt within him a divine spirit more restless than a
  devil; a spirit that could not feed on fictions or sleep at the dictation of
  any drug; an insomnia of intelligence that could not choose but understand; a
  lidless eye that could not escape from seeing a surge of spontaneous protest
  almost as involuntary as vomiting and stronger than the strength of fear, a
  voice not to be strangled, which forever, in a fashion so fierce and
  unfamiliar that it startled men like the roar of a blind beast, appealed from
  tyranny to God.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">III.&mdash;THE TRAGEDY OF THE PATRIOT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A book like this can be but a bare outline a life so full as
  that of William Cobbett. nevertheless an outline is needed, and is an outline
  that is not often supplied, is the advantage of such a small scope that it
  can focus what often seems formless and sprawling, through being too large to
  be seen. Cobbett produced a vast and voluminous mass of work; and vast and
  voluminous masses of work have been produced about Cobbett. Most of it is
  interesting and much of it is true; but none of it is the truth. What is
  wanted in modern biography is something as simple as the single line that
  marks the sweeping curve or the sharp corner in a weather-chart, that yet
  more simple line that runs round the nose or chin is a caricature. There have
  been caricatures enough of Cobbett but they caricatured the wrong features.
  They missed the point. The subject of Cobbett has been admirably simplified;
  but when it has been simplified, it has been simplified wrong.</p>

  <p>The story of Cobbett was a tragedy; a tragedy of a certain type. It was
  the disillusionment of a patriot. That definition covers all that is called
  its bewildering inconsistency. I do not mean to imply that he lost his
  patriotism. He most certainly retained it that was the tragedy. But he began
  by having the ordinary optimistic patriotism that looks outwards, and it
  changed into a pessimistic patriotism that looked inwards. His earlier and
  more cheerful attitude was one of mere defiance; but it grew to be a much
  more gloomy attitude when it seriously passed from defiance to defence. It
  was like the difference between a man blowing a trumpet and a man examining
  the condition of a gun. But there was also bound up in it the whole business
  of the modern economic problem; of the industrial individualism that produced
  the proletarian peril; in short, the whole problem of modern England. We may,
  say of Cobbett, as of more than one great man, that some of the most
  important incidents in his life happened after he was dead. But the truth to
  seize at this stage is the truth about this transition from a sort of
  centrifugal nationalism, that was cheery and even cheeky, to a sort of
  centripetal nationalism that was grave and even grim. A modern writer,
  resembling Cobbett only in having proved that the highest literary genius can
  be combined with publicity and popular journalism, has called one of his
  books of essays An Englishman Looks at the World. It would have fitted very
  well the first essays of Cobbett. But the time came when a deeper, a darker,
  a more withering experience might have carried the title: An Englishman Looks
  at England.</p>

  <p>The first fact about this first phase is that the patriotism of Cobbett
  was the passionate patriotism of the exile. He went to America while he was
  still quite young; so that even his memories of England were almost memories
  of childhood. They had not only the glamour of distance, but the glamour of
  which Wordsworth wrote, the glory and the freshness of a dream. The islands
  of the blest were supposed to lie to the west like Atlantis; but every man
  who has really sailed to Atlantis knows that the islands of the blest are
  left behind. Certainly all the islanders who have ever set forth from these
  islands to the modern Atlantis are at one in having that homing imagination
  that wings its way backward into the sunrise. Greatly as they have disagreed
  among themselves, they all agree in that. Perhaps the one rallying point for
  all Britons is that their songs in America have been songs of exile. The most
  familiar of them represents the Irishman with his bundle bound for
  Philadelphia, or the Englishman whistling 'Falmouth is a fine town' as he
  walks down the street of Baltimore, or the Scotsman rising to that high note
  not unworthy of the waters of Babylon.</p>

  <p>But still our hearts are true, our hearts are Highland, And we in dreams
  behold the Hebrides.</p>

  <p>So strong is such a tradition that later generations will dream of what
  they have never seen. The nationalism is most intense where the nation is
  only a name. Irish American is more Irish than Irish. The English colonial
  loyalist is more loyal than an Englishman. The loves and hatreds harden in
  that hard air under those clear skies of the western world. They are
  unsoftened by all internal doubts and criticisms that; from being on the
  spot. But with Cobbett this ignorance of interior details combined with the
  memories of one who had from childhood an eye for detail, especially for the
  details of fields and skies. He remembered England as a great green nursery;
  and felt as homesick in America as a boy sent to a big, bare, strange,
  uncomfortable boarding school.</p>

  <p>Nowhere in the world does an Englishman feel so much a stranger as in
  America. He does not necessarily dislike America, and Cobbett himself came to
  like it in the long run. He simply feels it is a stranger place than France
  or Flanders or Italy; that it is really the other side of the world like the
  other side of the moon. But if an Englishman still feels like this, in spite
  of the hypnotism of the talk about an Anglo-Saxon race and the hope of an
  Anglo-American alliance, it was immeasurably more so when Cobbett landed in
  what had quite recently been enemy territory. He met not only an alien
  atmosphere but a blast of hatred against England.</p>

  <p>There were indeed some Americans who sympathised with England as compared
  with France. They were those grouped around Hamilton, who being avowedly
  anti-popular in his politics was not likely to be very popular in his
  personality. They counted a certain number of New England Puritans; for
  almost the only real resemblance between New England and Old England was that
  neither of them could make head or tail of France. But though historians
  divide American opinion into the French party and the English party, I
  suspect that the atmosphere of popular sympathy was far more French than
  English. The whole romance of America consisted of rebellion against England;
  except that part of it that consisted of rescue by France. Nobody who knows
  what popular legends are like could expect the princess suddenly to take the
  side of the dragon against St. George. It was quite true, of course, that
  England was by no means merely a dragon and France was by no means only a
  saint. But in revolutions strong enough to overthrow all historic authorities
  and create a new nationality there must be the sort of impatient simplicity
  that sees characters in black and white; and few men at that moment could
  persuade a real American mob that England was not so black as she was
  painted. Moreover, the men of that age did not talk about racial unity; and
  they were bound to France by something like a religious unity. To leave out
  the definite democratic creed in judging Jefferson and his contemporaries is
  exactly like leaving Mahomedanism out of Mahomet. England did not believe in
  that democratic creed; and, being honest in those days, did not pretend to do
  so for a moment. I take it that the air that Cobbett had to breathe was not
  only American but Anti-English.</p>

  <p>It is part of the picturesque combat of personalities throughout his life
  that his first cockshy was, of all men in the world, the famous Priestley,
  the Unitarian and friend of French or American ideals in England. Priestley
  was a type of the sort of idealist whose ideals are pure but just a little
  perverse; the sort of internationalist who is specially unpopular among
  nationalists. The slight superiority in the tone of such intellectuals
  towards the popular patriotism of their hour aroused Cobbett to a rage quite
  ignorant and incongruous and yet not unhealthy. What probably made the
  refined Unitarian very annoying to the unrefined Surrey farmer was the notion
  of attacking England in America. For exile affected the Surrey farmer in
  quite the opposite way. It drove him to representing England as a sort of
  Eden from which he and Dr. Priestley had been driven forth; only that
  Priestley slandered that paradise and it was left for Cobbett to defend it.
  In a series of furious pamphlets with the appropriate signature of Peter
  Porcupine, he not only attacked the English democrats but to a great extent
  the American democracy. It is important to note that his motive was much more
  patriotism than conservatism. It is sometimes said that Cobbett began in pure
  conservatism; men talk of him as a Tory from the start; but even from the
  start the ease was more complex than that. His old father the farmer, if he
  was a Tory, was a Tory with ideas of his own, for he defended the American
  rebels; and Cobbett had first gone to America bearing a letter to the great
  Thomas Jefferson. He did not defend England because England was monarchical
  and he was a Royalist, or because England was aristocratic and he was a snob,
  or because England was the home of Toryism and he was a Tory. He defended
  England because England was attacked and he was an Englishman; and his real
  rage was reserved for other Englishmen who attacked her, or seemed to him not
  sufficiently to defend her. For this reason he extravagantly abused Dr.
  Priestley, for this reason he extravagantly abused Tom Paine, the author of
  The Age of Reason: writing a bitter burlesque life of that author, full of
  innocent lies: a story with a strange sequel. For this reason he lectured the
  wondering people of that western land about the beauty of the British
  Constitution, of British laws, of British landlords, of British military
  policy, of almost everything, in fact, that he was afterwards famous for
  rending and rolling in the mud.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile his pamphleteering was getting better and better; those quaint
  studies of English grammar in the corners of the cold barracks at daybreak
  had trained him not only in language but in logic; and the furious tenderness
  of exile gave him inspiration. Towards the end of his American visit he
  showed his uncontrollable fancy for having a finger in every pie by
  denouncing an American doctor as a quack. He lost his case and was cast in
  heavy damages so that he decided to quit the country, leaving behind him a
  farewell address to the Americans, one of the least friendly farewells to be
  found in literature. This last American injustice, as he saw it, finally
  reconciled him to his own country; and it was in a glow of romantic reaction
  in favour of everything English that the exile re-entered England. The crisis
  of his life came between that hour and the hour some seventeen years later
  when he left it once more.</p>

  <p>The Tories of England, waging war against Republicans abroad and Radicals
  at home, naturally received the great reactionary with a roar of welcome. The
  most prominent figure in the political group that received him was William
  Windham. He was a fine specimen of the old English aristocrat; that is, he
  was a Whig more Tory than the Tories. He was a fine specimen of the
  cultivated gentleman and dilettante; and therefore he was educated enough to
  see that the uneducated demagogue was a genuine English man of letters. He
  and his friends gave Cobbett the practical backing necessary for the founding
  of the celebrated Cobbett's Register. It may be well to remark that Cobbett's
  Register really was Cobbett's. He retained his intellectual independence he
  made no party compact with Windham or anybody else: nay, he flatly refused
  money from his friends in a way almost tartly honourable. But Windham and he
  were at one with the enthusiasm with which they flung their energies into the
  defence of Old England against the French Revolution and its American
  sympathisers. The swing and momentum of his American triumphs carried Cobbett
  on like a tide, and he may well have felt that he was at the top of his
  fortunes. It was just about this time that curious things began to
  happen.</p>

  <p>All the time he had wandered on the bare baked prairies under the hard
  white light of the western skies, he had remembered the high green fields of
  his father's farm and the clouds and the comfort of the rain. For him even
  more than for Nelson, and in another sense, there was something united and
  almost interchangeable in the three terms of England, home, and beauty. But
  his was no mere landscape-painter's but a land-owner's and a land-worker's
  love; and he pored more and more intently over the practice and detail of the
  farming he had known in boyhood. As he looked at crops or barns or orchards,
  it seemed as if the frown on his shrewd square face became first thoughtful
  and then doubtful. Things were not going well; and bit by bit he began to
  work out in his own mind a notion of the cause. For instance, it was
  essential to true farming that the farmer should be secure on his farm. If he
  was not legally and literally a peasant proprietor, he must at least be
  rooted like a peasant. At the moment peasants were being rooted out like
  weeds instead of being rooted like trees. Landlords were refusing to grant
  the long leases that gave a status to a yeomanry; they were chopping them up
  into shorter terms, and shifting and evicting for higher rents. And when he
  looked for the cause of this, he thought he had found it in the new
  fluctuation of prices and even of the value of money; in the paper money that
  symbolised to him such insecurity and shuffling and sharp practice. It meant
  the destruction not only of the old sort of yeoman but of the old sort of
  squire. Stockbrokers and Jews and jobbers from the town were driving out the
  national gentry; he would appeal to the great leaders of the party of the
  gentry to save them. He turned to his own Tory leaders, to Windham and the
  party of Pitt; for they were the natural saviours of the green countryside
  from this yellow fever of finance.</p>

  <p>There is sometimes in a great comedy a scene of almost tragic irony, when
  some simple character enters, eager, voluble, and full of his subject, and
  pours it out quite confidently to a group of listeners. It is long before
  even the spectator realises that the listeners are very silent. It is much
  longer before the speaker realises it. It is long before even a hint leads
  him to look, at first with doubt and at last with horror, at the significant
  and sinister smile faintly present on all those unanswering faces. That was
  the sort of scene that occurred in history when Cobbett came rushing to his
  Tory friends with his great scheme for saving English agriculture. He did not
  understand that restrained smirk on the pinched face of Pitt; that shadow of
  something like shame that may have rested for a moment on the more generous
  face of Windham. We could imagine one of them looking at the ceiling and the
  other at the floor; and neither answering a word.</p>

  <p>For William Cobbett had not in fact the faintest notion of what manner of
  men he served, or what sort of Government he was supporting. If Cobbett
  eventually found that the Tories were not satisfactory, it was for the very
  simple reason that he found that the Tories were not Tories. They may have
  had a desire to restore the old regime in France, largely because it would
  mean France being less vigorous and victorious than under the new regime of
  Napoleon. But they had not the faintest desire to save the old regime in
  England. Why should they? Men like Pitt and Perceval and the rest were more
  entangled with the new world than ever they were with the old; and were in
  much closer touch with the stockbrokers than with the farmers. Above a11 they
  had no notion of what Cobbett was talking about when he talked of giving the
  farmer the stability of a yeoman. The only laws they could imagine as
  applicable to rural life were the game laws. For that purpose perhaps it was
  desirable that the country should continue to exist. It was seldom possible
  to start a hare in Lombard Street, and quite awkward to shoot a partridge in
  Threadneedle Street. Otherwise there was really no reason why Lombard Street
  and Threadneedle Street should not extend to the ends of the earth. The
  educated class in England knew much more about preserving pheasants than
  peasants: it was an aitch they were very careful not to drop.</p>

  <p>The biographies of Cobbett commonly say that he began life as a Tory and
  afterwards changed his politics and became a sort of Radical. The proportions
  of this picture are misleading. Cobbett was never anything that an enemy
  would call a turncoat or a friend would call a brand from the burning. There
  is no sharp break in his life, breaking the very backbone of his principles;
  such as there is in the life of a penitent or the life of a traitor. It is
  not true that he belonged successively to two parties: it is much truer to
  say that he never belonged to any. But in so far as there were elements of
  the Radical in him at the end, there had been traces of them from the
  beginning. And in so far as he was in one sense a Tory at the beginning, he
  remained a Tory to the end. The truth is that the confusion was riot in
  Cobbett but in the terms Tory and Radical. They are not exact terms; they are
  nothing like so exact as Cobbett was. His general position is intrinsically
  quite clear and, as men go, quite consistent. It was the Tories who were not
  clear about Toryism. It was the Radicals who were inconsistent about
  Radicalism. I do not mean that he had no inconsistencies; he had a great
  many. He had all those inconsistencies of mere verbal variation which are
  almost invariable in a man who throws himself with equal vehemence into the
  proving of many different propositions in many different connections. But the
  inconsistencies of Cobbett were very superficial; much more superficial than
  the changes in most political careers. The man who played Peter Porcupine in
  America did not differ so much from the man who brought the bones of Tom
  Paine like holy relics to England as the Disraeli of the Revolutionary Epick
  differed from the Disraeli of the Primrose League, or the Gladstone who was
  the hope of the stern and unbending Tories from the Gladstone who was the
  idol of the Radicals and Nonconformists.</p>

  <p>Cobbett was a very consistent man, in every essential sense. It was the
  parties claiming or repudiating him who were quite inconsistent. To
  understand the point it is necessary to refer briefly to the history of those
  parties. There had once been something like a real war between Whigs and
  Tories. It was the real war between aristocracy and monarchy; two mortal
  enemies who have wrestled through all history. But in England aristocracy had
  won. Formal histories tell us that the Crown passed from the House of Stuart
  to the House of Brunswick. But in fact, while the Stuarts lost it, the
  Brunswicks never got it. The old original Crown the Stuarts had worn was
  thrown away with the Great Seal, when James the Second fled to France. The
  young George the Third had indeed tried to recover it with the aid of a
  Scottish Tory; just as the young Charles Edward had tried to recover it with
  the aid of the Scottish Jacobites. But it never was recovered. A loyalty to
  it lingered in middle-class and especially literary circles; as in Johnson
  and Goldsmith and many of the wisest and best individual thinkers of the
  eighteenth century. Cobbett came a little too late in time and a little too
  low in the social scale to touch this old and intelligent Tory middleclass
  before it died out. I do not know whether he realised how often he visited
  the Deserted Village in the course of the Rural Rides. Johnson he regarded
  with one of those accidental animosities that justified to some extent his
  reputation for mere spite. Cobbett had a prejudice against Johnson; which is
  all the more amusing because it was exactly the sort of prejudice that
  Johnson might have had against him. Cobbett regarded Johnson as a mere
  pedantic pensioner; and Johnson would very possibly have regarded Cobbett as
  he regarded Wilkes, more or less in the abstract as a dirty demagogue. So
  many things united these two great Englishmen, and not least their
  instinctive embodiment of England; they were alike in their benevolent
  bullying, in something private and practical, and very much to the point in
  their individual tenderness, in their surly sympathy for the Catholic
  tradition, in their dark doubts of the coming time. But above all they were
  united by the thing that divided them: the most genial and humane of all
  forms of hatred; their passionate and personal hatred of people they had
  never seen.</p>

  <p>In any case, Cobbett was born long after the true Tory monarchy had died,
  and he never quite understood its tradition. If he grew up a Tory and in some
  sense remained a Tory, it was in somewhat vaguer traditions that he was
  traditional. He liked old customs and the continuity of family life to be
  found in the countryside; he loved England in a sense that was very real and
  unfortunately very rare. I mean that it was a positive love that looked
  inwards upon the beloved; and not merely a negative love that looked outwards
  for rivals or remote imitations. If this sort of love of what is national and
  normal be called conservative, certainly that character was rooted in him.
  But what was called his Radicalism was equally radical. He realised by the
  light of nature the last deductions of the democratic speculators in so far
  as they can fairly be deduced. But the last conclusions which the republicans
  could reach were only the ancient axioms on which the monarchies had
  originally been founded. They were only forgotten because they were
  fundamental. Cobbett had a great faculty of not forgetting the foundations,
  as most of us do forget the foundations of a house, especially if we walk
  about on the roof. He had one very virile sort of simplicity: he was true to
  the truisms. He was never ashamed of the homely appearance of a humble and a
  faithful truth. Cobbett always really believed in popular principles, though
  he saw no cause to talk Greek and call them democratic principles. He could
  not see that the new industrial progress had anything to do with these
  principles; and he was perfectly right. He knew that the real revolutionary
  song had been about fields and furrows, and not about wheels and rails. He
  knew that the Revolution had begun with bread. He was not in the least
  impressed by its ending in smoke. The man who had once been a rioter waving
  the red flag in a revolution may now be a guard waving the red flag on a
  railway-line. But this will not convince the realistic reformer that a
  railway-line is the same as a revolution.</p>

  <p>When Radicalism was caught up in the wheel that was the symbol of
  industrialism, the opposite school tended the opposite way, by the slight
  movement that makes the balance of a party system. The Tories could pose as
  the agricultural party; if only a party of squires and not of peasants. But
  it was no longer a real war, like the war between Parliament and the King, in
  which Parliament had finally triumphed. The new Whigs and Tories were only
  two different shades of the same colour, like the dark blue of the Tory
  University and the light blue of the Whig University. They were at most only
  two different types of the same only garchy. They were often only two
  different, generations of the same oligarchy. The one was still making money
  in the town, while the other had made enough money to live in the country.
  That Cobbett cut across this sort of distinction of mere sentiment and
  association is not a mark of his inconsistency but of his consistency. He
  knew what he wanted and the Whigs and Tories only offered two slightly
  different reasons for not giving it to him. There was no logic in the things
  that held them apart, or in the things they lumped together. There was
  nothing in the nature of a rational sequence in the notion of one party
  standing for aristocracy and the land, and the other for democracy and
  machinery. It was as meaningless as if one party were associated with justice
  and beef, while the other was wholly dedicated to mercy and mutton. And it
  was as if they had joined in reviling the inconsistency of a common-sense
  person, who desired the more merciful treatment of oxen or the more just
  distribution of muttonchops. Now this is why it is vital at this point to
  realise the true nature of the Tory regime which extends intermittently from
  Pitt to Peel. Friends and foes alike have treated it as a reactionary regime;
  but that is only because the facts about it have not been faced. Pitt and his
  followers were not in the least Tory in the sense of traditional. They were
  only Tory in the sense of tyrannical. If trying to destroy all old
  constitutional liberties makes a man a conservative, then certainly Pitt and
  Castlereagh were model conservatives. But it would be hard to say what it was
  they conserved. There was not a single historic tradition, not a single human
  memory of the past, for which they ever showed the faintest sympathy. The
  truth is that the whole of this passage in history will be read wildly wrong
  unless we clearly understand that Pitt and Peel were highly modern and purely
  mercantile figures, helping to found the purely modern and mercantile world.
  Thus it was Pitt who began the degradation and destruction of a genuine
  gentry, by selling peerages right and left to every pawnbroker or pork
  butcher who would pay for them. If ever men were responsible for handing the
  country over to cads, it was the party of gentlemen who waved the Union Jack
  after Waterloo. It was so in all the more decent or defensible aspects of
  commercialism. In that sense Pitt cared nothing for the opinion of the
  Country Party; or even for the opinion of the Country. What he cared for was
  the opinion of the City. His real bodyguard was a battalion of bankers. It
  has often been pointed out that he had many of the merits of a liberal; he
  had also the vices of a liberal, and especially the illiberalities of a
  liberal. Pitt was the real founder of the Manchester School. Peel only
  followed the real policy of his party in eventually helping its triumph. We
  talk of Peel's abrupt acceptance of Free Trade; but it would be truer to talk
  of his temporary acceptance of Protection. As a type of human being, he had
  always been purely commercial, and not in the least conservative. In a word,
  these men did indeed fight democracy abroad and persecute it at home. But
  they did not defend aristocracy, far less monarchy. What they did was to
  establish plutocracy; and mainly a parvenu plutocracy. And if it be a glory
  to have created the modern industrial state, they can claim a very great
  share in it. Cobbett did not grudge it to them.</p>

  <p>Broadly speaking, if there was one man who was bound to be the antithesis
  of William Cobbett it was William Pitt. Anybody who expected anything else,
  merely because the two men were at one time classed as Tories, is the person
  really incapable of understanding intellectual consistency. Cobbett had only
  supported Pitt because he thought the Pitt rule stood for Old England; but it
  did not. Cobbett never supported the Pitt party after he had discovered that
  it did not. It is true that as he drifted further from Pitt and the Tories he
  necessarily appeared to be drifting nearer to Brougham and the Radicals, who
  also did not. But the slightest acquaintance with what he said about Brougham
  and the Radicals will show that it was almost always a movement of repulsion
  and not of attraction. His preference for any party was rather too
  comparative to be complimentary. It would hardly have been flattering to Mr.
  Pitt to be told that his appearance had only seemed to be something of a
  relief after that of Dr. Rush, or to Lord Brougham to say that his society
  seemed quite tolerable to one fleeing from that of Lord Castlereagh. But
  Cobbett's public alliances, as distinct from his private affections, seldom
  went much further than this. He may have come eventually almost to hate
  Orator Hunt; but I doubt whether he had ever really liked him. Windham I am
  inclined to think that he really liked; and lie made earnest efforts to
  explain to that perplexed Tory that there was nothing inconsistent with
  Toryism in his pleas for labour and the land. He remained in this doubtful
  and negative attitude, nearer to the Radicals rather than more Radical, when
  something happened that changed everything; something that broke his life in
  two in the middle like a blow that breaks the backbone.</p>

  <p>He inserted in his Register an indignant protest against the flogging of
  certain English soldiers under a guard of German mercenaries. It is essential
  to realise that the accent is on the word English and the word German. He was
  not merely a humanitarian protesting against inhumanity. He was a patriot
  protesting against his countrymen being tortured to make a spectacle for
  foreigners. Being a very genuine Englishman, he cared nothing for all the
  nonsense about allies and enemies, in comparison with the real difference
  between Englishmen and foreigners. Indeed, by the whole trend of his mind he
  would always have preferred the French to the German; and nobody would have
  rejoiced more than he at that great and just alliance that brought about the
  downfall of Prussia. Anyhow he printed his protest; and instantly discovered
  that he had touched the spring which launched a whole huge engine of
  destruction against himself. The great Tory Government, which he had come
  back from America to serve, had no doubt about how it should deal with this
  sort of patriotic service. He was instantly pinned with a prosecution, tried
  before the usual packed jury of the White Terror, and eventually sentenced to
  imprisonment for two years in Newgate, accompanied by a fine that meant
  ruin.</p>

  <p>Cobbett was bewildered by the blow; and seems at first to have been
  reduced to despair. It is said that he talked of throwing up his whole public
  work, since it could not be conducted without involving his family in such
  ruin. There has been much dispute about the story of some such despairing
  surrender being communicated to the Government. It seems to me that Cobbett's
  own account of the incident is probably true in the main; all the more as he
  owned frankly that his family had once persuaded him to this course: of
  which, he said, he had afterwards repented. There was some talk of a letter
  that he had recalled being maliciously published. It is possible: but the
  whole story seems rather confused. Certainly Cobbett was fought through all
  his life with weapons of a peculiar baseness; a certain mean spirit which is
  rather peculiar to such aristocracies when alarmed. It was that mean spirit
  that stole and published the scandalous poem of Wilkes. It was that spirit
  which used for political ends the private fault of Parnell. Cobbett suffered
  from this often enough; but his complaints in this case are rather chaotic
  and inconsistent. It is very characteristic of Cobbett that even in
  repudiating the action he argued in defence of it; pointing out that there
  would be nothing immoral in a private man out of private affection abandoning
  public work that nobody could demand of him as a duty. His argument was sound
  enough; but it did not give a real picture of his complex and confused
  situation. In order to understand the meaning of the whole business, we must
  understand two things that are relevant to the whole of his life; though the
  first refers more particularly to this earlier passage in his life. It will
  be well to get these conceptions clear before this chapter concludes.</p>

  <p>First, it must be clearly understood that Cobbett was not yet a
  Revolutionist; even if he was already a Radical, he was still subconsciously
  the Tory patriot who had made his name by waging war on all Revolutionists.
  He had indeed kept his English journalism independent of parties; but if he
  had originally had any party, it was the Tory party. In other words, his
  disappointment had begun, but he still had enough admiration to be
  disappointed. He was still sufficiently orthodox to be troubled by doubt.
  Then came the shameful and incredible shock of the Constitution he had once
  defended swinging round and knocking him silly. It was no wonder if, for the
  moment, it did knock him very silly. But it is reading the last lucid rage of
  the Radical Cobbett into the first dark and confused doubts of the
  Conservative Cobbett to expect him to have met his first trial in as he met
  his second trial in His real revolutionary spirit was not the cause of his
  imprisonment; it was the result of it.</p>

  <p>The fools who put Cobbett in prison probably did believe they were
  crushing a Jacobin, when they were really creating one. And they were
  creating a Jacobin out of the best Anti-Jacobin of the age. Apart from all
  political labels, they were manufacturing the greatest rebel, of English
  history out of the most unpromising materials. Perhaps he was the only real
  rebel that was ever manufactured out of purely English materials. But he was
  all the more a furious rebel because he was a reluctant rebel. For the man
  who paced that cell, like a lion in a cage, had not any of the detachment
  given either by idealism or cynicism. He had not fully learned to expect
  injustice; he had not yet survived disappointment, the dark surprise of
  youth. The man in that cell was no Stoic, trained in the Latin logic of
  Condorcet or Carnot, seeing his own virtues as part of the ideal system of
  the Republic and his own sufferings as part of the inevitable system of the
  Kings. He was no Irish martyr, schooled to breathe the very air of tragedy
  and tyranny and vengeance, and living in a noble but unnatural exaltation of
  wholly spiritual hate. Like most men of a very English type, he was
  inordinately fond of happiness. And happiness to him was concrete and not
  abstract; it was his own farm, his own family, his own children. Like most
  men of a very masculine type, he was probably a good deal dominated by his
  wife. And his wife and family had evidently hung on heavily to drag him back
  from his political precipice. But the worst of it was that he was suffering
  for an idea; and as yet did not quite know what idea. That is where this
  great angry and bewildered Englishman differed from the French Stoics or the
  Irish patriots. They appealed to the gods against the kings, to the ideas
  against the facts; but it seemed to the Englishman that his own god and king
  had condemned him. They saw clear skies above a confused world; but it was
  upon him that his own sky had fallen. He had indeed in his mind all that
  volcanic amalgam of ancient loyalties and popular sympathies which puzzles
  the student of party labels; but it was still in his subconscious mind. He
  had not yet a creed as Robespierre or Jefferson or O'Connell had a creed. In
  fact, he was not suffering for an idea he was suffering for an instinct. But
  the instinct seemed to him a natural part of that natural order which had
  suddenly sprung on him an unnatural revenge. In so far as he had originally
  believed in anything, it was in the authorities that had thrown him into
  gaol. In so far as he had any creed, it had been the Constitution which
  condemned him as a felon. He had acted on a patriotic impulse; and patriotism
  had punished him for being patriotic. All this first transition of
  bewilderment must be allowed for; but when it is allowed for, something else
  remains. Even when his head had cleared and his creed consolidated, there
  remained something about him for which the reader must be prepared to make
  allowances; as much as when we see him swaying rather blindly under this
  first blow.</p>

  <p>Cobbett was a particular human type; the very last to be fairly understood
  in those quiet times of which the virtue is sociability and the vice is
  snobbery. He was the imperfect martyr. The modern and popular way of putting
  it is to say that a man can really be a martyr without being by any means a
  saint. The more subtle truth is that he can even be a saint and still have
  that sort of imperfection. The first of Christian saints was in that sense a
  very imperfect martyr. He eventually suffered martyrdom for a Master whom he
  had cursed and denied. That marks the tremendous realism of our religion: its
  heroes had not heroic faults. They had not those Byronic vices that can pose
  almost as virtues. When they said they were miserable sinners, it was because
  they really dared to confess the miserable sins. Tradition says that the
  saint in question actually asked to be crucified upslde-down, as if making
  himself a mere parody of a martyr. And there is something of the same sacred
  topsy-turvydom in the strange fancy by which he is haunted in all
  hagiological art and legend by the symbol of his failure. The crowing of a
  cock, which has become a phrase for insolence, has in this case actually
  become an emblem of meekness. Rome has lifted up the cock of Peter higher
  than the eagle of Caesar, not to preach pride to kings but to preach humility
  to pontiffs. The cock is crowing for ever that the saint may never crow.</p>

  <p>Cobbett was a much more imperfect martyr; for he lived and died by a much
  more imperfect light. But this is the contradiction that explains all his
  contradictions. His courage was not consistent, complete, a thing working
  itself out by a perfectly clear principle. His heroic stature was not
  properly or perfectly proportioned, it was merely heroic. He sometimes fell
  below himself; but it was because he had a far higher and more arduous
  standard of manhood than most men, especially the men around him. He began
  tasks that he did not always finish; he took up rash positions that he
  sometimes found to be untenable.</p>

  <p>More than once in his career there comes in an element of anti-climax and
  bathos, at which the world will find it easy to laugh. But the world will
  have no sort of right to laugh. In the lives of most of us there is no such
  anti-climax simply because there is no climax. If we do not abandon those
  tasks it is because we do not attempt them; and we are not crucified
  upside-down because we have no intention of being crucified at all. The
  ordinary Sophist or Sadducee, passing the grotesque crucifixion, would have
  no right to mock the martyr with the crowing of the cock. The ordinary
  politician or political writer of Cobbett's time or ours had no right to mock
  the inconsistencies of Cobbett. The whole scheme and standard of his life was
  higher and harder than theirs, even of the best of them. Men like Bentham and
  Brougham were sincere reformers in the ordinary sense. Men like Macaulay and
  Mackintosh were good men in the normal fashion. But they served their world;
  they never set out to fight the whole world as Cobbett did. Good and bad
  alike, they are like civilians sitting at home and criticising a shattered
  and shell-shocked soldier. There is no particular disgrace in being a
  civilian; though there may be in being an ungenerous civilian.</p>

  <p>One example may illustrate what is meant by the comparison. Cobbett got
  himself flung into a common gaol for protesting against the flogging of
  British soldiers in the middle of the Napoleonic war; he afterwards went to
  America to avoid being flung into prison again. Macaulay, nearly a generation
  later, in time of peace, when the general mood was much more humanitarian,
  had the ordinary official task of apologising for flagrantly savage floggings
  of the same sort, simply because he happened to be Secretary for War and the
  blustering Lord Cardigan happened to be Commander of the Forces in London.
  Nobody in his senses would call Macaulay a cruel man. He simply regarded
  himself as a good party man, making the best of a bad case, as a part of his
  least agreeable parliamentary duties. His biographer, Sir George Trevelyan,
  certainly a very liberal and humane man, expresses no particular surprise at
  it; and nobody felt any particular surprise at it. Most people probably
  regarded it as we regard the uncomfortable duty of a barrister, who has to
  minimise the acts of a monster who has tortured children. It was part of the
  routine, of the rules of the game, of the way of the world. But the man who
  accepts everything and defends such things is not in the same world with the
  man who risks everything, or even anything, to denounce them. We may well say
  about Macaulay what he himself said about Cranmer: 'It is no great
  condemnation of a man to say that he did not possess heroic fortitude.' And
  it is no great condemnation of him to say that he will never come within a
  thousand miles of the man who does possess heroic fortitude, even for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>For if the common or conventional man is not to be condemned for failing
  to be a hero, still less is the other man to be condemned for succeeding in
  being half a hero or nine-tenths of a hero. The imperfect martyr may be
  judged by the perfect martyr, but not by anybody else; and the perfect martyr
  will probably have the charity as well as the patience of the perfect saint.
  Nobody will pretend that Cobbett had the patience of the perfect saint. He
  had not enough of the charity, though he had more than many might suppose,
  especially the people who make a point of being charitable to the rich. It is
  true that even his heroism was incalculable and inconsequent; but the
  question of proportion and even of quantity does not touch the question of
  quality. One moment of Cobbett's courage is of a different quality from a
  lifetime of Macaulay's common sense. Macaulay, in his life as in his logic,
  was nothing worse than superficial. It was the tragedy of Cobbett that he was
  fundamental. Of all our social critics lie was by far the most fundamental.
  He could not help seeing a fight of first principles deadly enough to daunt
  any fighter. He could not help realising an evil too large for most men to
  realise, let alone resist. It was as if he had been given an appalling
  vision, in which the whole land he looked at, dotted with peaceful houses and
  indifferent men, had the lines and slopes of a slow earthquake.</p>

  <p>Macaulay, it has been noted, said about Cranmer that he could not be
  blamed for not being a hero and a martyr. But for all that Macaulay blamed
  him a good deal for being a coward and a snob. Cobbett said about Cranmer
  that the very thought that such a being had walked the earth on two legs was
  enough to make the reeling brain doubt the existence of God; but that peace
  and faith flow back again into the soul when we remember that he was burned
  alive. I quote the sentiment from memory; but that was the substance of the
  remark. It is a remark touched with a certain exaggeration. It is not an
  observation marked primarily by measure or precise proportion or the
  mellowing of truth with charity. Macaulay's criticism of Cranmer is more
  effective for everyday purposes; as when he says that the crime of the Tudor
  politician was not in being too indifferent to be killed, but in killing
  other people for things about which he was indifferent, and enacting laws
  against anyone 'who should do from conviction what he had done from
  cowardice.' But there is a quality in that outburst of Cobbett about Cranmer
  which we must learn to appreciate or leave off troubling about Cobbett. There
  is a volume and a violence of humanity in such hatred; a hatred straight from
  the heart like a knockout blow straight from the shoulder. It is a blast from
  a furnace. And it is only in such a furnace seven times heated that men
  suffer for an idea-or even suffer for an impulse.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, the only effect of the imprisonment was to turn an impulse into an
  idea. He may have lacked some of the virtues of a philosopher; even including
  the philosophy. He may not have been perfect as a hero; or even have
  possessed any of the qualities of a martyr except the martyrdom. But he was
  emphatically the sort of man with whom one cannot afford to be in the wrong.
  It was suicidally silly to act with such injustice to a man with such a
  talent for expounding justice, including intellectual justice. It would have
  been wiser in the governing class to have gone on their natural course and
  continued to harry the imbecile and to torment the dumb. Thousands of poor
  men have been and are persecuted quite as unjustly as Cobbett by the police
  and plutocracy of modern states; but a certain political instinct and
  practical intuition have generally and wisely guided the authorities to hit
  the sort of man who cannot possibly hit them back. It is impossible not to
  comment on the very curious carelessness, which in this case allowed the rich
  and the rulers to commit the customary cruelties upon a man eminently capable
  of telling the tale. They threw him into gaol for nothing, or for anything,
  or for something more or less meritorious, for all the world as if he had
  been his own grandfather the agricultural labourer.</p>

  <p>Certainly if they put him in prison, they ought never to have let him out.
  Surely the flexible British Constitution of Pitt and Castlereagh would have
  been equal to the necessity of sending him to Botany Bay for life. For that
  Constitution was very free when it came to attacking freedom. The man who
  came out of that prison was not the man who went in. It is not enough to say
  that he came out in a rage, and may be said to have remained in a rage; to
  have lived in a rage for thirty years, until he died in a rage in his own
  place upon the hills of Surrey. There are rages and rages, and they ought to
  have seen in his eyes when they opened the door that they had let loose a
  revolution. We talk of a man being in a towering passion and that vigorous
  English phrase, so much in his own literary manner, is symbolic of his
  intellectual importance. He did indeed return in a towering passion, a
  passion that towered above towns and villages like a waterspout, or a cyclone
  visible from ten counties and crossing England like the stride of the storm.
  The most terrible of human tongues was loosened and went through the country
  like a wandering bell, of incessant anger and alarum; till men must have
  wondered why, when it was in their power, they had not cut it out.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">IV.&mdash;REVOLUTION AND THE BONES OF PAINE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">His imprisonment destroyed in Cobbett the whole dream with
  which he had returned rejoicing from America. That is, it did not in the
  least destroy his love of his native land; but it did destroy the illusion
  that he would there be able to breathe quite easily a native air. He could no
  longer hope, as it had once seemed so natural to do, that the spontaneous and
  colloquial language that sprang so easily to his own lips would commend
  itself as easily to people in his own land; that there he would be among
  neighbours and would talk without an interpreter. England was not a place
  where they understood plain English. From the very beginning of his fresh
  start after imprisonment we find him, therefore, facing the fact that he will
  never be able to say all that he wants to say or to fulfil himself as he had
  meant to do. Moreover, his fresh start was one not only after imprisonment,
  but after ruin and practical bankruptcy; and the fresh start was not a very
  fortunate start. His farming was not successful, his financial difficulties
  became acute; and it looked as if Cobbett in England would be in every sense
  a failure. Hence we have to record (before coming to the crowning and
  decisive part of his English career) another interruption in the form of a
  visit to America. The visit was a shorter one; and is chiefly interesting
  through two or three episodes which must be taken in their turn. But we must
  first say a word of the conditions in his own country.</p>

  <p>The first note of the new Cobbett who came out from captivity is the
  abrupt and absolute cessation of his first boyish feelings about the war with
  France; the feelings he probably had when he ran away to sea as a boy. He was
  no longer jolly enough to be a Jingo. I do not use the word in a bad sense;
  for indeed Cobbett's Jingoism has never been bad enough to be called
  Imperialism. He had been for fighting the French on the perfectly healthy
  ground that he was saving his own beloved island from the French. But anyhow
  this simple way of looking at it became impossible after his imprisonment. He
  was still a patriot; he was never anything in the least like a pacifist; but
  he had learnt something that he could not unlearn. He who had cheered on the
  dogs of war with Windham for a fellow-huntsman called them off abruptly, with
  a sort of harsh humanitarianism. He came out positively on the side of
  stopping the war. That is the change that is really significant. He would
  waste no more time on saving England from the French. He had the huge task of
  saving England from the English.</p>

  <p>Even here, however, it is easy to miss the consistency under all the
  inconsistencies. It is highly characteristic of him that he had refused with
  especial fury the proposal to stop the war at an earlier stage, when the
  proposal was based on the argument (still so common among commercial
  peacemongers) that war is bad for commerce. Cobbett was quite consistent in
  having an equal contempt for the Pacifist who made peace for that reason and
  for the Pittite who made war for that reason. But he was more and more
  convinced that the Pittites were only making war for that reason. The moment
  he concluded that only the bankers and merchants really wanted war, and the
  populace suffered from it without need, he was perfectly consistent in
  changing sides. He would have been quite inconsistent if he had not changed
  sides. Windham himself had said, "Perish Commerce; but let the Constitution
  be saved." Cobbett had made it his motto, though now perhaps in the amended
  form, "Perish Commerce and Constitutions; but let the country be saved."
  Only, he was more and more grimly convinced that it needed saving, and not
  from Napoleon. He was not less of an English patriot, but perhaps he was in
  one sense a little less of an Englishman, if being an Englishman means being
  happy and happy-go-lucky and comforted by compromises and ready to believe
  anything printed in the Times.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the war ended with Waterloo and the peace began with Peterloo.
  That was the only kind of peace that seemed likely to begin. It was time that
  somebody did something, whether or no Cobbett could do anything. The new
  capitalistic phase of England was coming to a crisis, especially in the
  North. The industrial revolution was already producing the anti-industrial
  revolution&mdash;which is likely to be a much more real revolution. Machines
were
  busy and men were idle. Some men indeed were not idle; but those who were
  most busy were the political economists, who were busy proving on paper that
  the machinery that had made people poor must really have made them rich. Very
  soon something began to happen that anybody might have foreseen, whether he
  was on the side of the machines or the men, so long as he understood that men
  are not machines. Cobbett realised it, though he did not approve of it. The
  men began to destroy the machine; to destroy them as if they were dragons
  that had come in to destroy the paradise of innocence and liberty. Cobbett,
  who upon that matter was a moderate, wrote a Letter to the Luddites, urging
  them to desist from this method of protest; but he banded himself with the
  most resolute of the Radicals, with old Cartwright and Orator Hunt and
  Burdett, in demanding drastic democratic reforms. His Register, already
  popular at a shilling, was made enormously more popular by being sold for
  twopence, with the ironic boast of Twopenny Trash. Never in English history
  perhaps has one man wielded so vast and potent a popular instrument as
  Cobbett did. He and his friends were incessant in demanding reform, which had
  already begun to be spelt with a capital letter. They pointed to the dark
  sphinx of industrial destitution and demanded that there should be at least
  some answer to its riddle.</p>

  <p>The answer of the Government was interesting. It was to discover a Plot of
  the most vast and sanguinary sort started by a Mr. Spence, a little
  bookseller holding the mild sort of Socialism that is called Land
  Nationalisation. It was called Spencean Philanthropy. All the other reformers
  were apparently in the plot, however remote or contrary were their notions of
  reform. Cobbett was about as unlike a Spencean Philanthropist, or indeed any
  other philanthropist, as any one could conceivably be, but he was supposed to
  be deep in the plot. The Government hastily armed itself with abnormal powers
  of violence and secrecy, and threw an iron net of spies and special agents
  over the whole country to catch all fish, great and small, all reformers,
  reasonable and unreasonable. One of the big fish decided to break the net
  before it closed and to get away into other waters. He may have been wise or
  foolish, but he was in the habit of acting very promptly on his wisdom or
  folly. Cobbett resolved once more to escape to America and conduct his
  campaign from there. As a matter of fact, he only stayed there two years,
  bombarding England with pamphlets all the time, and then came back to follow
  up his pamphlets with a yet more furious personal onslaught. But he was
  blamed for his expedient; and indeed it was his fate to go through life being
  blamed first for attacking and then for retreating, blamed for all he did and
  all he did not do. Anyhow he thought he was more useful to the reform in
  America than in gaol; and certainly we should otherwise have lost some
  protests that were much needed. Nobody else could have done justice to an
  even more absurd plot called 'the Derbyshire Insurrection,' which was
  entirely created by an agent provocateur named Oliver. It is typical of the
  wrangles that go on among reformers that if some of the other Radicals blamed
  Cobbett for escaping to America, he was even more withering about them for
  playing the coward in England. He denounced them for doing nothing to save
  the wretched men who suffered from this hideous plot to manufacture a plot.
  It was on this occasion that Cobbett quarrelled with Burdett, as he
  afterwards quarrelled with Hunt, and indeed with nearly everybody else.
  Before leaving for America, indeed, he had had quarrels of less public but
  more personal importance with his own agents. As already noted, his own
  economic position was not promising; and this probably contributed to his
  deciding on a second American visit. In any case, he reached America in the
  May of 1817, and soon established himself on a farm in Long Island.</p>

  <p>Cobbett's second visit to America is associated with an action which all
  the authorities have censured as ridiculous, and which I think has been
  ridiculously censured. I do not mean that there was nothing to criticise, but
  only that there is something quite wrong in the criticisms. The story thus
  strangely misunderstood is the story of Cobbett carrying back the remains of
  Thomas Paine, the English Jacobin, to be laid to rest in England.</p>

  <p>Thomas Paine invented the name of the Age of Reason; and he was one of
  those sincere but curiously simple men who really did think that the age of
  reason was beginning, at about the time when it was really ending. Being a
  secularist of the most simple-minded sort, he naturally aroused angry
  passions at the moment, as does any poor fellow who stands on a chair and
  tries to heckle heaven in Hyde Park. But considering him in retrospect, the
  modern world will be more disposed to wonder at his belief than at his
  unbelief. The denial of Christianity is as old as Christianity; we might well
  say older. The anti-clerical will probably last as long as the Church, which
  will last as long as the world. But it is doubtful when we shall see again
  the positive side of Paine's philosophy; the part that was at once credulous
  and creative. It is impossible, alas, for us to believe that a Republic will
  put everything right, that elections everywhere will ensure equality for all.
  For him the Church was at best a beautiful dream and the Republic a human
  reality today it is his Republic that is the beautiful dream. There was in
  that liberalism much of the leisure of the eighteenth-century aristocrats who
  invented it; and much of the sheltered seclusion also. The garden which
  Voltaire told a man to cultivate was really almost as innocent as the garden
  of Eden. But the young men who saw such visions were none the less seeing
  visions of paradise, though it was an earthly paradise. Rationalism is a
  romance of youth. There is nothing very much the matter with the age of
  reason; except, alas, that it comes before the age of discretion.</p>

  <p>But Paine had one point of superiority to the mere Radicals then rising in
  England, who shared his cocksure rationalism and sublime superficiality. He
  was not merely commercial, any more than Shelley; and he seems to have had
  his doubts about the hopefulness of mere huckstering and unhampered exchange,
  somewhat in the manner of Cobbett. Now Cobbett, in his first American period,
  was hitting out at the Jacobins on the principle of 'see a head and hit it';
  and the intellectual brow of Thomas Paine was naturally prominent. He
  attacked Paine as he generally did attack people, in a highly personal and
  ferocious manner. He said things about that ingenuous Deist that were
  certainly quite false; Cobbett was not guilty of lying, but he was guilty of
  readily thinking evil. To him at that time Tom Paine was simply the Age of
  Reason; that is, the Age of Red Ruin. For Cobbett also was as simple as Tom
  Paine and especially at that time he had as guileless a faith in Royalism as
  the other had in Republicanism. But when Cobbett came back to America after
  his imprisonment, he had made the terrible discovery that terminates youth,
  even if it often gives a new interest to life; the discovery that it is a
  strange world, that things are not what they seem, and certainly not always
  what they profess to be. He was in a position to begin to admit that there
  might be more in Tom Paine than met the eye, especially the blind eye that he
  had turned on all the enemies of the English crown. But above all he went to
  America with his head still buzzing like a beehive with all sorts of new
  notions and suspicions, which went to make up the really original political
  philosophy of his later years. He was becoming a sceptic, not about crowns
  and creeds but about things that the world round him reverenced far more than
  any creed or crown. He was doubting things that Whigs and Tories and Radicals
  were more and more taking for granted; the whole basis of the commercial
  success of his country. Just as he was questioning the very medium of their
  exchange, so he was questioning the very language of their controversy. He
  thought that paper money was waste paper; and he thought that industrial
  wealth was really only industrious waste. He doubted above all the abstract
  and invisible, we might say the transcendental, part of modern capitalism;
  the national debts and the international loans. Tom Paine took on a
  comparatively easy job when he attacked the Church. Will Cobbett had the
  inconceivable impudence to attack the Bank. Then he knew he was in collision
  with the colossal force of the whole modern world, like a man running with
  his head down at an express train. The whole world would leave such a lunatic
  to run alone; and Cobbett was left to run entirely alone. All the books and
  pamphlets of the period, and indeed all the books and pamphlets ever since,
  have scoffed at him about this part of his political adventure. He read such
  books and pamphlets with a face continually hardening into defiance and
  scorn; and then he made a strange discovery. In turning over, it may be, one
  out of twenty of the contemporary books and papers he was thus in the habit
  of tossing aside with a snort, not to say a snarl, he came upon some of the
  real writings of the atrocious Paine; and was astonished to find that some of
  the opinions of the atrocious Paine bore a remarkable resemblance to those of
  the just and public-spirited Cobbett. He found that Paine, of all men, and
  apparently alone among all men, had really tried to say some of these things
  that needed so excruciatingly to be said; and about which all mankind walked
  about gagged and in a ghastly silence. Surely it is not so very difficult to
  understand that he should have a revulsion so violent and impetuous as his
  original plunge of prejudice; surely those who have taken the trouble to
  write studies of Cobbett might have learned something of his manner of
  living, and how all his generosity and his vanity, his simplicity and his
  emotionalism, his sympathy for the under-dog and his fury at being himself
  the dupe, should have called clamorously in him for some vigorous external
  action; for some proclamation or practical motion that should relieve the
  feelings and perhaps right the wrong. He had cruelly calumniated a man who
  might have been his friend and was certainly his ally. And it was too late to
  tell him so. For that which he had madly splashed with mud had already
  returned to dust, and Thomas Paine was dead.</p>

  <p>Cobbett did something which any other age would have understood; nay,
  something that we should have understood if narrated of any other age. He was
  instantly possessed by a human impulse, which even the heathens have
  comprehended and only the humanitarians have denied. It brought him as it
  were at one stride to the grave of the man whose pardon he would have asked.
  The man had been buried in his land of exile; and Cobbett, himself an exile,
  realised as few could realise the horror of dying far away from home. He
  believed, as only he could believe, that the one perfect act of piety which
  could be done to the body of an Englishman was to bring it back to England.
  It seemed an absurd notion to men in the mercantile and rather materialistic
  mood of the beginning of the nineteenth century; it may well still seem
  absurd to many in the twentieth century. It would not seem absurd to men in
  the twelfth century. It will not seem absurd to men in the thirtieth or the
  fortieth century. It was felt to be incongruous with something comic and
  commonplace about contemporary manners; with the chimney-pot hats and the
  mutton-chop whiskers. But when men look back over long periods they have lost
  the contemporary derision of details and see only the main lines of humanity,
  and these acts of primitive ritual seem merely human. Aristophanes was a
  mighty mocker and derider of the details that were modern in his day; the
  wild hats and whiskers of ancient progress. Aristophanes was an enemy of
  modernity, and indeed of modernism. Aristophanes was also a lord of bad
  language, a man with all the splendid scurrility of Cobbett. But suppose it
  were recorded of Aristophanes that he came to repent of his satire on
  Euripides; suppose he had concluded too late that what he had taken for
  sophistry and scepticism had been a truer traditionalism. We should see
  nothing but beauty and pathos in some story about Aristophanes bringing the
  body of Euripides from some barbarian country to the temple of Athene. There
  would be nothing undignified or unworthy to be carved on a classic frieze in
  the figure of the great scoffer following the hearse of the great sceptic.
  But this is only because in the process of time the little things are lost
  and only the large lines remain. For that little flask of oil, with which the
  scoffer once stopped the mouth of the sceptic, has lost its bathos for us:
  and might well be the vessel of the sacred chrism for the anointing of the
  dead.</p>

  <p>Cobbett was a son of the earth, or what used to be called a child of
  nature; and these rude and natural people are all ritualists. He had those
  giant gestures that are encouraged by the elbowroom of empty spaces and open
  skies; those impulses to send signals by instinctive posture and pantomime;
  to beckon, to brandish, to lift the head in battle or bow it at the
  graveside. He had in him also the mysticism of the mob; the mob that makes
  bonfires and burns men in effigy and chairs a man through the cheering
  streets on a chariot made of marching men. In all this impulsive imagery, and
  in another sense (I fear) than that in which it was said of Abraham Lincoln,
  he does truly and indeed belong to the ages. He belongs to all the ages
  except perhaps his own age. His own age certainly saw nothing but absurdity
  in his strange pilgrimage and his strange relics. The men with the
  chimney-pot hats could see nothing but the grotesque side of "Cobby" lugging
  about as his luggage the bones of an old blasphemer in a box. And yet their
  idea of the grotesque in the matter is something of a paradox. For in a sense
  these people objected to ritual not because it was grotesque but because it
  was not grotesque. It was not grotesque enough to fit in with the grotesque
  hats and whiskers that were the fashion. The Utilitarians, like their fathers
  the Puritans, used ugliness as a uniform; that is, as a symbol. For the
  utilitarian ritual was not merely utilitarian. The chimney-pot hats were not
  really useful like chimney pots. The mutton-chop whiskers were not really
  sustaining like muttonchops. These also were a sort of black heraldry, like
  the black trappings of their funerals; but they symbolised the funeral of art
  or the old spontaneous symbolism. When a man used one of the gestures of that
  more generous symbolism they were offended with him and considered him
  ludicrous. But they were really offended with him for not being so ludicrous
  as themselves.</p>

  <p>This itch or instinct for representative action, for ritual that goes
  beyond words like an embrace or a blow, was that part of Cobbett's character
  which was always reaching backwards to the medieval England that has never
  lost the name of Merry England. He was a man born out of due time, and forced
  to live and suffer in a world of mechanical traffic going to Manchester; when
  he ought to have ridden with Chaucer to Canterbury. His heraldry was
  sometimes deliberately grotesque, but it was always heraldic. When he hung up
  the gridiron outside his house in Kensington, he not only repeated the ritual
  of all the old shop signs and inn-signs, but that of the crests and banners.
  But it was this in him that brought him into sympathy with another people
  whom he began to understand; and a remark of Peel aptly illustrates how
  little that understanding was understood.</p>

  <p>Sir Robert Peel was a man who had stupidity in the soul. It went, as it
  often does, along with all the talents of a man of business and a man of the
  world. He was the kind of man who only knows things by their labels, and has
  not only no comprehension but no curiosity touching their substance or what
  they are made of. A supreme example of this is to be found in this phase of
  the life of Cobbett. Peel seems to have suggested that nothing could
  seemingly be more impossible, nothing certainly more absurd, than a
  combination between Cobbett and O'Connell. And the reason he gave was that
  O'Connell was a Roman Catholic and Cobbett had brought back the bones of Tom
  Paine, who was an infidel. In other words, O'Connell was labelled a Papist
  and Paine was labelled a blasphemer and Cobbett was saddled with his bones as
  a sort of joke in the comic papers. This is the kind of folly that makes the
  fool walk like a mystical figure through the pages of the Book of Proverbs.
  If the man who said it had ever caught one glimpse of the inside of things,
  of the inside of men's minds, of the intrinsic implications of men's
  religions, he would have seen something that might have surprised him. The
  truth is that in all public life at that moment there was only one public man
  who could possibly understand and sympathise with the business of poor
  Paine's bones; and that man was Daniel O'Connell the Liberator. Any Catholic
  understands the idea of penitence taking the form of penance; if it be only
  natural penitence for a wrong done to a naturalistic philosopher. Any
  Catholic understands the idea of penance taking the form of public penance,
  and all the more if it really has in it something of humiliation. But above
  all O'Connell had the best reasons in the world for knowing that, in the
  English atmosphere of the moment, any attempt at such a public penance would
  really be accompanied by the simplest form of humiliation: that of being
  laughed at. He knew much better than most people that England in that mood
  thought such public penance theatrical. The business of the death of
  D'Esterre was in many ways a curious parallel to that of the burial of Paine.
  O'Connell in his youth had shot a man dead in a duel; and his perfectly
  sincere remorse led him to swear never again to accept a challenge, and to
  wear on his right hand a white glove to remind himself of his sin, especially
  when he took Sacrament. The refusal of challenges provided his political
  opponents with a conveniently safe man to challenge. And the wearing of the
  white glove was a piece of dramatic symbolism which naturally offended the
  plain sobriety and simple modesty of the young Disraeli. But O'Connell was
  well aware that, even among ordinary Englishmen, there was not one in a
  thousand who understood what his public gesture meant. It is possible that
  their fathers might have understood it. It is possible that their fathers did
  not think Henry the Second was merely striking a melodramatic attitude when
  he was scourged at the tomb of the saint he had martyred. But anyhow the
  sentiments of O'Connell were equally simple, too simple to be understood.
  Morbid as his scruple may seem to those who lament the murderous habits of
  the Irish, it really did seem to O'Connell a serious thing to have killed a
  man. Morbid as the other scruple may seem to those who are always reviling
  that demagogue for reviling everybody, it really did seem to Cobbett a
  serious thing to have libelled a man. That his sorrow for wrongdoing was
  highly intermittent and inconsistent is very true; but he scarcely stands
  alone among his fellow creatures in that respect. But not to see that there
  was a reason for remorse in the case of Paine is to be blind to the whole
  case of Cobbett. Cobbett was shouting in deafening tones to deaf ears a
  certain warning of danger; a danger he alone could see, or at least a danger
  in which no one else would believe. He believed that the whole financial
  network of national debts and paper money would eventually drag England to
  destruction. He may have been wrong; though in fact it is far easier now than
  it was then to maintain that he was right. But anyhow, believing this, he
  found that almost the only other Englishman who had warned England, or helped
  him to save England, was an Englishman whom he had himself slandered and
  might even have silenced by mistake. If there be any man who does not
  understand his feeling the need of a public apology to such a solitary and
  silent ally, such a man is very much less of a man than William Cobbett or
  Daniel O'Connell or Thomas Paine.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, as things stood, he could get no more good out of the possible
  sympathy of O'Connell than out of the inevitable contempt of Peel. His
  political friendships, as we have noted, were very unstable and
  unsatisfactory; not so much, as is often supposed, because Cobbett changed
  his opinion, as because nobody else ever really understood the fundamental
  opinion that he did not change. The fellowship he did afterwards establish
  with O'Connell was more genuine than most; but that also was disturbed by
  quarrels. In one case, curiously enough, Cobbett was more O'Connellite than
  O'Connell. He fiercely (and perhaps rightly) blamed the Liberator for
  accepting a compromise suited to the more reactionary Irish bishops. His
  quarrel with Hunt dates originally from his second visit to America, from
  which he sent word, in his reckless way, repudiating some letter of which he
  had forgotten the details, and which contained a charge against the domestic
  morals of Hunt, whom Cobbett did not then even know. Yet even the
  misunderstanding is of the sort that wants understanding. Many of the
  Radicals really were cut off from Cobbett by a deep difference about morals;
  and anybody who thinks the Radical Programme must look a larger thing than
  the institution of marriage does not know what the story of Cobbett is all
  about.</p>

  <p>Another work of this period bore the fine title of The Last Hundred Days
  of English Freedom, attacking the coercion acts that had threatened his
  liberty in England. It is notable that Cobbett always treated tyranny as a
  new thing; his attitude to abstract revolution was well expressed in the
  phrase, 'I was born under a King and Constitution; but I was not born under
  the Six Acts.' It was a new Tory raid and reign of terror that had driven him
  into exile; but he did not remain there long; and his conduct when he
  returned showed he had no intention of being silent at home if he had been
  noisy abroad. An accident brought his change of plans to a head. His farm on
  Long Island was burned down; he moved first to New York, and finally from New
  York to England. He was given a public dinner and addressed a large meeting;
  perhaps it is ironical that his only immediate difficulty was bringing the
  bones of Paine through the customhouse. I wonder what he said when asked if
  he had anything to declare.</p>

  <p>So for the second time William Cobbett came back across the Atlantic to
  the harbours of his own land. It would be easy to insist on a picturesque
  contrast between the two voyages. Doubtless, if somebody had told him on his
  first voyage that he would make the second voyage in the character of the
  chief mourner for Tom Paine, he might well have thrown that obliging prophet
  into the sea. On the first occasion he had returned to receive what truly
  might be called a royal welcome; a royal welcome from Royalists. He had come
  back to be toasted by the gentlemen of England, talking over their wine of
  his services to the Tory cause, of the blows that their loyal yeoman could
  deal at Boney and the Yanks. He had come back the second time, the demagogue
  of a darker hour, to meet a roar of angry admiration from the strikers and
  frame-breakers of the smoky north as well as the potential rick-burners of
  the agrarian war; the Titan of the English Revolution. At least if any man
  could have made an English revolution, if any hour in our history could
  really have been revolutionary, the hour was come and the man.</p>

  <p>And yet he was exactly the same man. He was the same solid figure, with
  his sober good-humoured face and small shrewd eye; and in the depths of his
  mind, I fancy, no difference at all. It is difficult to talk of his inner
  consciousness, for nobody ever went there, least of all himself. But if it
  were penetrated, I fancy it would be found to be filled with a vast void of
  innocence that wondered and questioned, and was a little puzzled by the
  answers to its questions; as is a child by the inconsistencies or quarrels of
  its parents. Enormous queries, as elementary as nursery riddles, would have
  been found to fill that void. What was wrong? and how could it be wrong to be
  right? Why must not a soldier object to soldiers being starved by swindlers?
  Why must not a patriot object to their being flogged by foreigners? Why ought
  not a Tory to dislike squires being driven out by stockbrokers? Why ought not
  a Radical to dislike peasants being oppressed by Jews? Why did a man find
  himself in the House of Lords if he cheated the nation, and in Newgate if he
  tried to point out that it was cheated? As he gazed at the great expanses of
  that empty and shining sea, it may be that there was an interlude in his
  incessant mental activity of mere recrimination and retort, that the clouds
  of too much controversy cleared a little, and he became half conscious of why
  he was so incurably himself. But even so there would only have been found,
  like some strange sunrise under the sea, under his all too salt humour and
  all the waters of bitterness that had gone over him, a lucid and enduring
  surprise.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">V.&mdash;THE AMATEUR HISTORIAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">There is a joke with which we are all familiar, about the
  rustic who relates some local legend, as of a hero who hurled a huge rock
  into a river, and who says that it must be true because the rock is till
  there. As is commonly the case in the small talk of a scientific age, the
  satire is directed against popular ideas. As is also commonly the case in
  such an age, the satire is really very shallow. When the critics mock a man
  for saying 'I believe it because I have seen the rock,' nine-tenths of them
  could not give any sort of reason for their own historic beliefs, beyond
  saying, 'I believe it because I saw it somewhere set out in printer's ink by
  somebody I never knew, referring to evidence I have never seen, and telling a
  tale which I cannot test in any way whatever, even by the look of the
  landscape.' The rustic does not rely merely on the rock but on the
  tradition&mdash;that is, the truthfulness of a certain sort of people, many of
  whom he has known. But at least the rock and the river do fit in with the
  tradition; and to that limited extent consistency is corroboration. It is far
  more superstitious to assume that print is proof. So far as print is
  concerned, the whole of history might be as utterly imaginationary as that
  mazy river and that dancing rock in the dizzy pipe-dream of 'Kubla Khan'.</p>

  <p>But there are others whose state of mind is still more extraordinary. They
  not only do not need the landscape to corroborate their history, but they do
  not care if the landscape contradicts their history. They are not content
  with the very reasonable statement that the existence of the rock does not
  prove the existence of the hero. They are so anxious to show that there was
  no hero, that they will shut their eyes and say there is no rock. If the map
  marks the place as a waterless desert, they will declare it is as dry as a
  bone, though the whole valley resound with the rushing river. The whole huge
  rock will be invisible, if a little book on geology says it is impossible.
  This is at the opposite extreme to the irrational credulity of the rustic,
  but it is infinitely more irrational. It is not inferring something from the
  rock that the rock does not prove; it is denying what the rock does prove. Or
  rather it is denying what the rock is; that ultimate and terrible rock of
  reality, that veritable rock of offence, against which all delusions will
  dash themselves to pieces. This great delusion of the prior claim of printed
  matter, as something anterior to experience and capable of contradicting it,
  is the main weakness of modern urban society. The chief mark of the modern
  man has been that he has gone through a landscape with his eyes glued to a
  guidebook, and could actually deny in the one anything that he could not find
  in the other. One man, however, happened to look up from the book and see
  things for himself; he was a man of too impatient a temper, and later he
  showed too hasty a disposition to tear the book up, or toss the book away.
  But there had been granted to him a strange and high and heroic sort of
  faith. He could believe his eyes.</p>

  <p>William Cobbett was pre-eminently a man with eyes in his head. He had of
  course other human attributes; such as a tongue in his head. Many considered
  it a merely bitter or blasphemously seditious tongue; but it was a tongue
  that could sometimes be for great mobs like the tocsin from a great tower.
  But when all emotional effects of such demagogy or deafening sensationalism
  have died away, the impression that will remain longest in the mind is the
  quiet and constant use that he made of his eyes. It is as if, after all
  passions had chased each other like shadows across his face, we saw his face
  at last in repose and realised that he had the eyes of a sailor; the eyes
  that can see a dot or speck on the distant horizon. But he could see dots and
  specks in the foreground as well. He could focus his sight at many different
  ranges; an organic power which is the point of what Carlyle said of somebody
  else that he had eyes and not merely spectacles. Because his eyes were sharp
  they were clear; because his sight was exact it was even subtle. At its best
  it could really measure things, and even the degrees of things. It could
  place anything from the face of a stranger to the strength of a horse; from
  the shade of ripeness in a cornfield to the shade of rottenness in a Cabinet
  Minister. The ultimate impression of his personality is not so much of
  violence as of vigilance. So strong is this impression, that any one who has
  been long in his literary company cannot shake off an uncanny impression of
  being watched. He cannot help fancying that this man who has been dead a
  hundred years has his eye on events in England and may suddenly
  speak&mdash;probably not in an amiable manner. It is as if, in some elfin
tale,
  those strange eyes in one man's head were stars that could survive him.</p>

  <p>But there is one particular form of this faculty in Cobbett which is not
  so sharply apprehended; and perhaps is not so easy to apprehend. For in this
  sense it is a faculty which few people, if any people fully possess in the
  urban population of to day. It is destroyed rather than helped by the urban
  education of to day. Cobbett was very far from being an enemy of education.
  He was, as has been said elsewhere, a great educationist. He published French
  and English grammars of his own composition, and exhorted all young people to
  learn. Here and there he even showed a touch of that too crude and earnest
  respect for education which so often marks the self educated man. But for all
  that, he had a native power or piece of good fortune which education never
  gives and sometimes destroys. In one thing he was a very lucky and lonely
  mortal.</p>

  <p>He could see before he could read. Most modern people can read before they
  can see. They have read about a hundred things long before they have seen one
  of them. Most town children have read about corn or cattle as if they were
  dwarfs or dragons, long before they have seen a grain of wheat or a cow. Many
  of them have read about ships or churches, or the marching of soldiers or the
  crowd cheering a king, or any other normal sight, which they have never seen.
  By a weird mesmerism which it is not here necessary to analyse, what people
  read has a sort of magic power over their sight. It lays a spell on their
  eyes, so that they see what they expect to see. They do not see the most
  solid and striking things that contradict what they expect to see. They
  believe their schoolmasters too well to believe their eyes. They trust the
  map against the mountain. Cobbett was a man without these magic spectacles.
  He did not see what he expected to see, but what he saw. He liked books; but
  he could not only read between the lines but through the book.</p>

  <p>Now, in nothing is this more vivid than in his vision of history. Most of
  us know what was the accepted general version of English history when we were
  at school; at anyrate when I was at school, and still more, of course, when
  Cobbett was at school-in so far as he ever was at school. England had emerged
  out of a savage past to be the greatest empire in the world, with the
  best-balanced constitution in the world, by a wise and well-timed progress or
  series of reforms, that ever kept in mind the need of constitutionalism and
  of balance. The Barons had extorted a constitutional charter from the King,
  in advance of that feudal 'age' and a foundation for parliamentary freedom.
  The Commons came into the struggle for parliamentary freedom when it was
  waged against the Stuarts. By that time the Revival of Learning had led to
  the Reformation or sweeping away of the superstition that had been the only
  religion of the ruder feudal time. This enlightenment favoured the growth of
  democracy; and though the aristocrats still remained, and remain still, to
  give dignity to the state with their ancient blazonry of the Conquest and the
  Crusades, the law of the land is no longer controlled by the lords but by the
  citizens. Hence the country has been filled with a fresh and free population,
  made happy by humane and rational ideas, where there were once only a few
  serfs stunted by the most senseless superstitions. I ask any one if that is
  not a fair summary of the historical education in which most modern people
  over forty were brought up. And having read it first, we went to look at the
  towns and castles and abbeys afterwards, and saw it or tried to see it.
  Cobbett, not having read it, or not caring whether he had read it, saw
  something totally different. He saw what is really there.</p>

  <p>What would a man really see with his eyes if he simply walked across
  England? What would he actually see in the solid farms and towns of
  three-quarters of the country, if he could see them without any prejudice of
  historical interpretation? To begin with, he would see one thing which
  Cobbett saw, and nobody else seems ever to have seen, though it stared and
  still stares at everybody in big bulk and broad daylight. He would find
  England dotted with a vast number of little hamlets consisting entirely of
  little houses. Considered as little houses there is much that might be said
  about them both critical and sympathetic. They are generally picturesque
  cottages; they are often what is described as picturesque tumbledown
  cottages. They are the most beautiful houses in the world for all
  appreciative people who have ever been outside them. For the less obvious and
  outstanding people who have always been inside them, it would be an
  exaggeration to say that they are the most beautiful houses in the world.
  About these people inside also a great deal that is good and bad might be
  said; they are kindly and full of English humours and all the virtues that
  belong to an atmosphere of ale. But they are not citizens and do not want to
  be; they have hardly even heard of the word. They can no more imagine the
  vanishing of the squire than the vanishing of the sky; though they may
  grumble at the moods of both. But anyhow the point is that their houses are
  little houses, and' especially low houses; so that a tall man walking past
  them would sometimes have to stoop down under the eaves to peer into the
  front window, as if he were travelling in a town of the dwarfs. And the town
  is a very little town; often only a handful of houses to be counted on the
  fingers.</p>

  <p>In the midst of this little cluster or huddle of low houses rises
  something of which the spire or tower may be seen for miles. Relatively to
  the roofs beneath it, the tower is as much an exception as the Eiffel Tower.
  Relatively to the world in which it was built, it was really an experiment in
  engineering more extraordinary than the Eiffel Tower. For the first Gothic
  arch was really a thing more original than the first flying-ship. And indeed
  something of its leap and its uplifting seems to make architecture akin to
  aviation. Its distant vaulted roof looks like a maze of mathematical patterns
  as mysterious as the stars; and its balance of fighting gravitations and
  flying buttresses was a fine calculation in medieval mathematics. But it is
  not bare and metallic like the Eiffel Tower or the Zeppelin. Its stones are
  hurled at heaven in an arc as by the kick of a catapult; but that simple
  curve has not the mere cruelty of an engine of war. The whole building is
  also a forest of images and symbols and stories. There are saints bringing
  their tales from all the towns and countries in Europe. There are saints
  bearing the tools of all the trades and crafts in England. There are traces
  of trade brotherhoods as egalitarian as trades unions. There are traditions
  of universities more popular than popular education. There are a thousand
  things in the way of fancy and parody and pantomime; but with the wildest
  creative variety it is not chaotic. From the highest symbol of God tortured
  in stone and in silence, to the last wild gargoyle flung out into the sky as
  a devil cast forth with a gesture, the whole plan of that uplifted labyrinth
  shows the mastery of an ordered mind.</p>

  <p>It is the parish church, and it is often very old; for it was built in the
  days of darkness and savage superstition. The picturesque cottages are all of
  much later date; for they belong to the ages of progress and
  enlightenment.</p>

  <p>If people saw the Great Pyramid and found scattered about its base a few
  patchwork tents of a few ragged Bedouins, they would hardly say there had
  been no civilisation in that land until the Bedouins brought it. Yet a
  Pyramid is as plain as a post of wood compared with the dizzy balance and
  delicate energy of the Gothic. If they had seen some dingy tribe of
  barbarians living in their little mud huts, when high above their heads went
  the soaring arch of a Roman aqueduct almost as remote as the rainbow, they
  would hardly say that the Romans must have been savages and that the savages
  alone were civilised. Yet the round Roman arch is really rudimentary compared
  with the prism of forces in the pointed Gothic arch. But the truth is that
  the Catholics, having some humility even in their hatred, never did make this
  absurd pretence that paganism was barbaric, as their enemies afterwards made
  the absurd pretence that Catholicism was barbaric. They denounced the
  wickedness of the world, but they recognised the Pyramids and the Coliseum as
  wonders of the world. It was only the great medieval civilisation whose
  conquerors were base enough to pretend that it had not been a civilisation at
  all. But that is not the aspect of the ease immediately important here. The
  point immediately important here is that this solid stone object did and does
  stand up among the others like a mountain among molehills; and that nobody
  could see it but Cobbett. We talk of not seeing the wood for the trees; but
  one would think anybody could see a poplar-tree in spite of the presence of
  six rhododendron-trees. Yet we may repeat, in a spiritual but most realistic
  sense, that nobody except Cobbett could see the church spire.</p>

  <p>He did not by any means see all that was to be seen in the church, or all
  that has here been noted in the church. For that he would really have
  required more education; and not the sort of education that he could then
  have got merely by being educated. He was a simple man in a rationalistic
  age, and he saw something. It was something very primitive and elementary;
  but he saw it. He saw the size. He tells us again and again that he has found
  a village of which the whole present population could be put into the porch
  of the village church, leaving the whole vast and varied interior as empty
  and useless as Stonehenge. What had become of all the people? Why should
  anybody, in any age, pay to build a church serving two thousand people when
  he only had to serve twenty people? Was it true, could it be true, after all,
  that the population of England had so hugely increased from what had once
  been a mere handful? Was it only that the new towns had hugely increased,
  leaving the countryside a mere wilderness? And could it be true that the men
  who built such things were a sort of Pictish dwarfs or troglodytes of the
  twilight, when what they had left looked so like the houses of a generation
  of giants, which could not even be filled with a generation of dwarfs?</p>

  <p>These doubts had much to do with historical and social views of Cobbett to
  be considered in their order; but in the first place they are to be noted as
  a working model of his power to see things simply and as they stand. Hundreds
  of elegant essayists and artists had traced the more graceful proportions of
  Gothic buildings, vaguely regarding them as ruins. The end of the eighteenth
  century is full of these painters in watercolours and first cousins to the
  Earl of Cork. What Cobbett saw was not the graceful proportions but rather
  the disgraceful disproportions. He saw a colossal contrast; the contrast
  between a village that was hardly a hamlet and a village church that was
  almost a cathedral. It was the biggest and baldest of all the facts; and yet
  it was the fact that nobody else saw. The others did not see it because they
  had been educated not to see it; because they had been educated to see the
  opposite. Since liberty and light had come to the Commons with the Whig
  revolution, the Commons must somewhere or other be free and enlightened; they
  could not still be living in hovels under the shadow of a huge old church.
  There had been nothing before that revolution but feudal ferocity and priest
  craft. So, somehow or other, somebody had built the church by sheer ferocity;
  or priest craft can be made a complete substitute for every other craft,
  including the craft of the sculptor and the stonemason. But Cobbett began
  with the big fact that he could see with his own eyes, and with that he
  contrived, with tremendous reconstructive power, to turn all English history
  upside down.</p>

  <p>His view involved another truth that may be symbolised by another
  building. When we said that there was nothing but small houses to compete
  with the church, we meant of course that there was nothing else within the
  immediate circuit of the church: that the village church was the only big
  building in the village. There was another very big building at some distance
  from the village which bulked very much larger in the minds of the villagers.
  Indeed, it might be said that they lived in the material shadow of the church
  and in the moral shadow of the country house. Now the example of the squire's
  house is yet another which illustrates the illusion that is general and the
  realism that is exceedingly rare. All that Cobbett could have read in books,
  all that he could have learnt at school, would have taught him a view of the
  manor-house or country seat which is still a commonplace in novels and
  newspapers. It is almost literally a view; in the sense of a landscape seen
  in the mind's eye. But men only see that sort of view by shutting their eyes.
  Cobbett formed his views by opening his eyes. The universal impression or
  illusion was that the Tory squires were an ancient aristocracy, full of
  feudal notions and Norman blood; and from this it followed logically that
  they lived in castles or at anyrate in moated granges, Tudor manor-houses,
  and other ancient and appropriate haunts. If Cobbett had believed in
  historical novels, or in the histories that were all on the same model as the
  historical novels, he would have gone about looking for the Castle of Otranto
  in the valleys of England: and never seen the little temple that Horace
  Walpole really stuck up for himself on the top of Strawberry Hill.</p>

  <p>But Cobbett had this strange power of faith: he could believe his eyes.
  Most people cannot believe their eyes; it is the very last thing in which
  they can believe. They can believe in the wildest creeds and the crudest
  philosophies; similarly they can believe in a past made up of The Castle of
  Otranto and The Mysteries of Udolpho. But they cannot believe in the present;
  in the thing present to their sight; in the thing in whose real presence they
  stand. But Cobbett really had this unearthly detachment, this dry light of
  reality, this vision of a man from the moon. In that light he probably saw
  what the country houses are really like; as he certainly saw what the parish
  churches are really like. Here and there, there is really a castle; now
  generally a show place. Here and there, there is really an old Tudor manor,
  often preserved as carefully as a model in a museum. But the house of the
  squire dominating a hundred countrysides all over England is something quite
  different; something quite unmistakable; and something to a large extent
  uniform. It is emphatically a rule, where the romantic castles and manors are
  exceptions. It is a rule in more senses than one; for the populace has the
  squire for a landlord, for an employer, and, it may be added, for a judge;
  for the magistracy is made up of the gentry. Anyhow, the house has a positive
  character which amounts to a pattern.</p>

  <p>It really looks rather like a large public building from a large city
  exiled in the provinces. It looks like a Town Hall taken away on the wings of
  the fairies, and set down far away in the woodlands. It looks like a Palais
  de Justice rusticating for some reason or other and taking a ramble in the
  country. It is not only very large, but it does not look like a private house
  at all. It is like something conscious that it is a seat of government and
  power over men&mdash;as it is. It is nothing like so cosy as a castle. It is
  rather open in the same sense as a law-court. Above all, it is built in the
  same style as the average modern law-court. What makes that style important
  is its date. Very few of the real countryseats are really of a Tudor type;
  hardly any are of a medieval type. The type and pattern of them is of a sort
  that bears the stamp of a subsequent and clearly marked epoch of society.
  Generally they are Georgian houses; often they are rather earlier, and
  correspond to the quainter style of William of Orange and Queen Anne. But
  nearly all belong to what the French call the Classic Age; meaning that
  stretch of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in which the full result
  of the Renaissance worked itself out, becoming if anything more and more
  classical until its shell was broken by the Romantic movement and the French
  Revolution. In short, the whole architecture is the recent creation of a
  rationalistic age. It belongs as much to the Age of Reason as the books of
  Voltaire.</p>

  <p>But people were blinded to this fact by books they knew better than those
  of Voltaire. Every novel and novelette told them that a bad baronet lived in
  a castellated tower; and they could not see that he lived in a sort of
  comfortable classic temple. Tennyson, calling in his youth on the Lady Clara
  Vere de Vere, suffered the delusion of seeing a lion on her old stone gates.
  Most probably it was really a nymph or an urn. For that matter, Tennyson
  would probably have made some curious discoveries if he had looked more
  closely into Lady Clara's claims to Norman blood, however it might be with
  her claims to coronets. But for the moment I am speaking simply of things
  seen, or rather of things not seen. I am speaking of the veil which our
  version of history hangs between us and the real facts about our fathers,
  even the facts in front of our eyes. Very few people saw that the
  aristocratic country house is commonly a comparatively new building, and
  looks more like a General Post Office than a feudal fortress. Such ornament
  as it has is a curious cold exuberance of heathen nymphs and hollow temples.
  Because it stands for the age of the sceptics, its gods are not only dead but
  have never been alive. Its gardens are full of shrines without idols or idols
  without idolaters.</p>

  <p>Finally, as has been hinted already, there does exist a third historic
  memorial and variety of architecture or the use of architecture. Among these
  aristocratic houses and estates, setting aside such curiosities as castles,
  there does appear fairly commonly one type of country house that really is
  old and really is medieval. The medieval part of it is often in ruins, and
  only valued because it is in ruins. But the ruins have the same soaring and
  skyward lines as those of the large and empty parish church. Yet the house as
  a whole is by no means a ruin, but is turned into a country house quite as
  comfortable, or rather luxurious, as the more common pattern of the Georgian
  houses. But the very name of that house of luxury remains a medieval name;
  and a very queer name too.</p>

  <p>We should think it rather odd if a profiteer had a country house that was
  called The Cathedral. We might think it strange if a stockbroker had built a
  villa and habitually referred to it as a church. But we can hardly see the
  preposterous profanity by which one chance rich man after another has been
  able to commandeer or purchase a house which he still calls an Abbey. It is
  precisely as if he had gone to live in the parish church; had breakfasted on
  the altar, or cleaned his teeth in the font. That is the short and sharp
  summary of what has happened in English history; but few can get it thus
  foreshortened or in any such sharp outline. Anyhow, this third type of
  monument of the past does offer itself visibly to the eye like the other two.
  The romantic reactionary at the end of the eighteenth century might not often
  find the Bad Baronet in a castle, but might really find him in an abbey. The
  most attractive of all such reactionaries, Miss Catherine Morland, was not
  altogether disappointed in her search for the Mysteries of Udolpho. She knew
  at least that General Tilney lived in an abbey; though even she could hardly
  have mistaken General Tilney for an abbot. Nor was she wrong in supposing
  that a crime had been committed by that gentleman in Northanger Abbey. His
  crime was not being an abbot. But Jane Austen, who had so piercing a
  penetration of the shams of her own age, had had a little too much genteel
  education to penetrate the shams of history. Despite the perverse humour of
  her juvenile History of England, despite her spirited sympathy with Mary
  Stuart, she could not be expected to see the truth about the Tudor
  transition. In these matters she had begun with books, and could not be
  expected to read what is written in mere buildings and big monuments. She was
  educated, and had not the luck to be self-educated like Cobbett. The
  comparison is not so incongruous as it may seem. They were the four sharpest
  eyes that God had given to the England of that time; but two of them were
  turned inward into the home, and two were looking out of the window. I wish I
  could think that they ever met.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, all this is written in large letters of stone and clay across the
  land; in a giant alphabet of arch and column and flying buttress. And these
  three striking things stand out to tell the main talc of English history,
  even to a man who had never opened a book. The first is a very ancient and
  artistically beautiful parish church, far too big for its parish. The second
  is an aristocratic mansion of much later date, and looking like the palace of
  a German prince of the eighteenth century. The third is a similar palace
  constructed out of the ruins, if not of a similar parish church, at least of
  a religious building similar to the parish church. With those three solid
  facts alone a man might have pieced together the truth that no historians
  would tell him. Somehow or other there had once been a larger religious life
  which was also a popular life. Somehow or other its memorials had been taken
  over by a new race of men, who had become great lords in the land, and had
  been able to disdain alike the people and the religion.</p>

  <p>Cobbett was an amateur historian in that sense; that he used his own wits.
  Those who sniff at such amateur history are not using theirs. They say the
  amateur's views cannot be correct, because they are not founded on research.
  In other words, they say he cannot see what is there, because he sees what is
  obviously there. He cannot have seen the sun, because he evidently did not
  have to extract the sunbeams from cucumbers. He cannot have really understood
  that two and two make four, because he understood it at once. But allowing
  for this, such academic characters underrate even the detailed information of
  men like Cobbett. It must once more be emphasised very strongly that Cobbett
  did not in the least despise books. He had far too much common sense to
  despise any common and convenient way of obtaining information. He was the
  very reverse of the sort of sentimental reactionary who thinks that all
  humanity would be innocent if only it were illiterate. But he did not allow
  what he read to contradict what he had seen. And when he really began to
  read, he found that what he read confirmed what he had seen.</p>

  <p>I say he really began to read; for there is a distinction in this case. It
  is not merely a question of the books, but rather of the books behind the
  books. The fashionable book of history is at best little better than a
  leading article; it is founded on the documents as a leading article is
  founded on the news; in both cases a rather careful selection. Like a leading
  article the historical summary is generally partisan; and never quite so
  partisan as when it professes to be impartial. Cobbett had to go a little
  deeper than these superficial summaries to trace in the past the truths he
  had already discovered in the present. It was a fortunate coincidence that it
  was precisely at this time that the most learned and laborious of English
  historians produced the work on which so many other works have been founded.
  John Lingard was a very moderate man, but even the prejudices he was presumed
  to have gave him a detached position from the fashionable fallacies of that
  particular age. With a mass of material he established his own very moderate
  version of what had really happened in England; and by the use of that
  material Cobbett produced his own version, which some have hesitated to call
  moderate.</p>

  <p>This was the celebrated History of the Reformation, published in 1824. The
  real question at issue about the History of the Reformation is not so much
  concerned with a certain state of things as with the right reaction to that
  state of things. What ought a man to do when he believes that public opinion
  has grown accustomed to repose confidently in a completely wrong picture of
  the past? A man might agree with Cobbett about the existence of the error,
  without in the least agreeing with Cobbett about the proper process of the
  enlightenment. The very name of Lingard is enough to prove the possibility.
  Lingard had a strong case, and deliberately understated the case to give a
  greater impression of impartiality. Cobbett had the same strong case, and
  deliberately flung away all such airs of impartiality to prove how completely
  he had been convinced. When Cobbett found that what he conceived to be a
  truth had been concealed by a trick, his reaction was a towering passion; and
  whether that or a more patient exposition be appropriate to controversy,
  there is no doubt about which is appropriate to Cobbett. He would have said
  that when he found a man robbing his hen-roost he called out 'Stop, thief!'
  and not 'Stop, philosophical communist invading the thesis of private
  property!' He would have said that when a man told lies he called him a liar,
  and not a person insensible to the value of objective reality. Yet it is
  probably true that many listened to Lingard who could not listen to Cobbett.
  And it is true to say that such persons could not hear him because he talked
  so loud. But as to questioning what he said&mdash;that is quite different
and much
  more difficult. Those who suppose that he must be talking nonsense because he
  was talking too loud are much less clearheaded and even cool-headed than he
  was. Veracity has nothing to do with violence, one way or the other. One
  historian may prefer to say, 'The Emperor Nero set on foot several
  conspiracies against the life of Agrippina his mother, and expressed
  satisfaction when the final attempt was successful.' Another may say, 'The
  bloody and treacherous tyrant foully murdered his own mother, and fiendishly
  exulted in the detestable deed.' But the second statement records the same
  fact as the first, and records it equally correctly. It is accurate to say,
  'The Rev. Titus Oates declared on oath his knowledge of a Papist conspiracy;
  but his statements, which led to the execution of many Papists, were
  subsequently found to be fictitious.' But it is every bit as accurate to say,
  'The liar and perjurer Oates cruelly swore away the lives of innocent
  Catholics, blasphemously calling on God to witness to his murderous lie.' The
  violent man is telling the truth quite as logically and precisely as the more
  dignified man. It is a question of what we consider superiority of literary
  form; not of any sort of superiority in historical fact. And this was
  substantially the chief difference between Cobbett and Lingard; not to
  mention all the modern scholars who are pupils of Lingard.</p>

  <p>Cobbett stated all his facts in one prolonged and almost monotonous fury.
  But if he was wrong, he was wrong in his fury, not especially in his facts.
  There are many mistakes in his History of the Reformation, as there are in
  most histories; though most people did not even know what they were until
  they were carefully discovered and tabulated by Cardinal Gasquet. I doubt if
  there are so many of them as could be found by so good a scholar in all the
  more cautious and constitutional historians. Cobbett did not begin with whole
  masses of obvious myth and romance, like those which Macaulay criticised in
  Hume. He did not depend on the expurgated extravagances of manifestly mad
  sectarians, like those which Aytoun criticised in Macaulay. The truth is that
  the general impression that Cobbett wrote a wild romance is really only a
  general impression. It does not rest, and it never did rest, on the discovery
  of the particular points in which he was wrong. The impression was one of
  paradox; the mere fact that he seemed to be calling black white, when he
  declared that what was white had been blackened, or that what seemed to be
  white had only been whitewashed. But the shock came from the moral comment or
  application rather than from the definite details. For the definite details
  even then, very often, were not in dispute. For instance, it is supremely
  characteristic of Cobbett that he reversed the common titles by talking of
  Bloody Bess and Good Queen Mary. He could always find a popular phrase for an
  unpopular opinion. For he was always speaking to the mob, even when he was
  defying it. But this is an excellent example; for it is not shaken by any
  particular controversy about facts. Everybody knew even then that Queen
  Elizabeth was bloody, if pursuing people with execution and persecution and
  torture makes a person bloody; and that was the only reason for saying it of
  Mary. Everybody knew even then that Mary was good, if certain real virtues
  and responsibilities make a person good; a great deal more indubitably good
  than Elizabeth. It was the too obvious and biased motive of the inversion
  that irritated people. It was not really Cobbett's history that was in
  controversy; it was his controversialism. It was not his facts that were
  challenged; it was his challenge.</p>

  <p>Here we are only concerned with his controversy as a part of his
  character. And of this sort of challenge we may almost say that it was the
  whole of his character. We must see the situation very simply, if we would
  see it as he saw it. He was simply a man who had discovered a crime: ancient
  like many crimes; concealed like all crimes. He was as one who had found in a
  dark wood the bones of his mother, and suddenly knew she had been murdered.
  He knew now that England had been secretly slain. Some, he would say, might
  think it a matter of mild regret to be expressed in murmurs. But when he
  found a corpse he gave a shout; and if fools laughed at anyone shouting, he
  would shout the more, till the world should be shaken with that terrible cry
  in the night.</p>

  <p>It is that ringing and arresting cry of 'Murder!' wrung from him as he
  stumbled over those bones of the dead England, that distinguishes him from
  all his contemporaries. It is not the mere discovery of the bones, or in a
  sense even the study of them. It was not really, I repeat, the facts that
  were in dispute. The Gothic tower overhanging the modern cottage was as plain
  as a skeleton hanging on a gibbet. Some held that the bones were justly
  gibbeted; that the old England was fortunately dead. Others held that the
  bones were so old and decayed that they could now be the object of merely
  archaeological interest, like Egyptian mummies. What was peculiar to Cobbett
  was the way in which he treated this question of the past as a question of
  the present. He treated it, not as a historical point to be decided, but
  rather as a legal wrong to be righted. If he did not exactly answer the
  question, 'Can these dry bones live?' he did say in another sense, 'I know
  that their avenger liveth.' He was prepared to make those bones his business,
  like those of Paine; to be a detective in a mystery story, and present
  himself ex ossibus ultor. One might suppose a detective story would be more
  popular than an antiquarian essay; and a charge of crime more lucid than a
  meditation on archaeology. Yet this was not wholly so; and the paradox is
  relevant to the whole riddle of Cobbett. The cry that rang through the
  startled village was loud but hardly clear. It may be that it was too loud to
  be clear.</p>

  <p>It is possible to speak much too plainly to be understood. Most men with
  any convictions in a confused and complicated age have had the almost uncanny
  sensation of shouting at people that a mad dog is loose or the house is on
  fire, to be met merely with puzzled and painfully respectful expressions, as
  if the remark were a learned citation in Greek or Hebrew. For men in such an
  age are used to long words and cannot understand short ones. This comic sort
  of cross-purposes was especially the ease with Cobbett. The world, in the
  sense of the ordinary political and literary world, could not understand him
  or what he said. People could not understand it because it was not obscure
  enough. It did not soothe them with those formless but familiar obscurities
  which they expected as the proper prelude to any political suggestion. He
  came to the point too quickly; and it deafened them like an explosion and
  blinded them like a flash of lightning. His rapidity produced all the effect
  of remoteness. People of this political and literary sort understood much
  better the speakers they were used to; or liked much better the speakers they
  did not understand. The pompous and polysyllabic felicities of the diction of
  Pitt seemed to them comforting if not comprehensible. The rich and loaded
  style of Burke seemed like some display of imperial wealth which could be
  admired though not calculated. It was the same with the literary as with the
  political utterance of the time. It was much easier to persuade people to
  listen to the merely romantic praise of the past as uttered by Scott than to
  the realistic praise of the past as uttered by Cobbett. Men vaguely felt that
  any sympathy with things thus lost in the mists of antiquity ought to be
  conveyed in more or less misty language, and with the air of one dealing with
  things not only dead but even unreal. It was more soothing to be told by a
  Great Enchanter what ghosts might haunt a ruined abbey than to be asked by a
  hard-headed bully of a yeoman how many people would fit into the porch of a
  parish church. Men found Melrose Abbey more visible by moonlight than their
  own parish church by daylight. The world will never pay its debt to the great
  genius of Walter Scott, who effected in European literature that second
  Renaissance that was called Romance. He opened those high dikes of mud that
  cut men off from the rivers of popular romantic tradition, and irrigated the
  dry garden of the Age of Reason. It is no disrespect to him to say that lie
  was, like his own hero, an antiquary and at the same time a sceptic. But he
  was fashionable because he assured men that medievalism was only a romance;
  and Cobbett was far less fashionable when he urged it as a reality. Scott was
  merely sentimental about Mary Stuart, as he was about Charles Edward Stuart;
  he was singing 'Will ye no' come back again?' to people who would have been a
  horrible nuisance to him if they had come back again. But Cobbett was not
  sentimental about Mary Tudor; he did solidly believe that with her the good
  times went; and he did really want them to return.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, when he revised history the revision really was a revelation. The
  revision may be revised, but it will not be reversed. The revelation may
  reveal itself further, but it will never hide itself again. Cobbett let the
  cat out of the bag; and this is nonetheless true because it was rather a wild
  cat when it came out of his bag. Nobody could pretend that because it was a
  wild cat it was a fabulous animal, when it was so obviously careering down
  the street. In other words, he drew attention to a fact; a fact which others
  have followed up and matched and balanced with other facts, a fact which
  others have restated more mildly or analysed more delicately, but still the
  original fact which he furiously asserted and his foes furiously denied. In
  so far as modern histories do really differ from the History of the
  Reformation, it is mostly because we have come to repeat with decorum what
  even he only dared to hurl with defiance. Ruskin and William Morris and many
  more pursued his path through that living labyrinth that had once been
  regarded as the dead shell of a village church. Maitland and Gasquet and many
  others justified by laborious study and annotation his wild but shrewd
  guesses about the greatness of medieval sociology. It. was easy for them to
  state the medieval argument more mildly; simply because the modern audience
  had become more mild. But Cobbett's discovery can never be undiscovered; that
  is, it can never be covered up again. And that for the reason stated at the
  starting-point of this chapter.</p>

  <p>A city that is set on a, hill cannot be hid; a church set high above a
  city is even more hard to hide, when once it has been discovered. You cannot
  undiscover the elephant. That is why it is essential in this chapter to
  insist on the size and simplicity of the neglected thing, and the plain
  picture of the Surrey farmer standing staring at the village spire. Since
  Cobbett's historical conceptions have increasingly prevailed, there have been
  many attempts among the opponents of medieval ideals to get rid of this
  medieval renascence. There have been many efforts to explain away the
  elephant or minimise the cathedral. And they all fail by beginning at the
  trivial end and trying to chop inches off the elephant's tail; or seeking to
  set the ugliness of a gargoyle against the beauty of a cathedral. Thus they
  will pick this or that hole in the application of the Guild principle,
  without noticing that everything is conceded with the Guild principle itself;
  the simple fact that the principle of medieval trade was admittedly
  comradeship and justice, while the principle of modern trade was avowedly
  competition and greed. They will say that the Guild spirit was deficient in
  this and that; without beginning to touch the truth that we are deficient in
  the Guild spirit. In short, the attempts to rebut the revelations of medieval
  culture and creative reform are above all things trivial. They not only pick
  very small holes in a very large thing, but they do not seem to realise that
  the rest of the world can now look at the large thing as well as the small
  hole. But it was really William Cobbett, alighted from his horse, and
  standing for some idle moment in a church porch out of the rain, who first
  had a vision of this towering resurrection of a forgotten Christendom; and
  lifted up his eyes to things so lofty and remote that men had let them float
  unheeded over their heads like the tree-tops or the clouds. Perhaps the real
  story of Jack the Giant Killer is that Jack was the first man who was even
  tall enough to see the giant.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">VI.&mdash;THE RURAL RIDER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Even the most elementary sketches of Cobbett have tended to
  give too much of his biography and too little of his life. He had a
  picturesque career, if the pictures sometimes seemed to his critics to be
  comic pictures; he was always fighting, he was flung into gaol, he went
  wandering in foreign lands. And yet there was a sense in which everything he
  did was directed towards peace; a peace that he never fully gained. I have
  said that he swept across the country like a whirlwind; but in the heart of
  the whirlwind there is a calm. The picture in his own mind was a quiet
  picture; only, he was never left alone to enjoy it quietly. Perhaps it would
  be truer to say that he never left himself alone to enjoy it quietly. Anyhow,
  it was only occasionally in his wanderings through the world that he
  encountered the romantic adventure of staying at home. In the midst of his
  mind there was a secret landscape of field and farm under the evening light,
  which was continually being jerked out of the field of vision like a picture
  in a jolting camera. It is very difficult in practice to present the whole of
  his mind except as a fragmentary, mind; but perhaps the most continuous
  scroll of all that he liked and thought about can be found in the long,
  rolling panorama of the Rural Rides.</p>

  <p>A little while before the affair of his imprisonment he had taken a farm
  at Botley in Hampshire; where he lived for a time the sort of life he liked,
  spoiling his children and sparring with his neighbours; especially with the
  Botley parson. This reverend gentleman figured so prominently in Cobbett's
  satire as to become a sort of proverb; and yet the origin of a proverb is
  often difficult to trace. And it is by no means clear in what respect the
  infamy of the incumbent of Botley differed from that of other country
  clergymen. But he stands as a symbol of Cobbett's quarrel with the clergy of
  the Church of England; which in most of the other cases had other and more
  serious grounds. Two things may be noted, even at this stage, about his own
  rather curious sort of anti-clericalism. One is that if he scoffed at the
  Anglican clergy, he had not less but much more scorn and fury for the
  Dissenting Ministers and the Methodists and the Quakers. And second, that his
  first serious reason for dislike concerned the corruption of pluralism, and
  especially family favouritism. He execrated for economic reasons the large
  clerical families that kept their hold on a vast variety of livings and
  tithes. He was as yet unconscious that this road was leading him, past the
  comfortable vicarage which he cursed as he passed it, towards the gateway of
  a grey ruin that was still called an abbey.</p>

  <p>In the confusion accompanying his great catastrophe, he had been obliged
  to sell his place at Botley; but much of his early life had radiated from
  there, and it makes a sort of starting-point for considering him in his
  capacity of a Rural Rider.</p>

  <p>The Rural Rides are a landscape; but they are also a portrait. Sometimes
  we seem to be watching under rolling clouds the rolling country of the
  shires, valleys coloured like maps, or downs that seem to shoulder away the
  sky; and then again we are only looking at the changes on one stubborn face
  as it relapses into good humour or hardens into hate. That combination of the
  object and the subject is what makes writing into literature; and the Rural
  Rides are pure literature. Perhaps they are all the more literature because
  they might be counted loose and colloquial even for language. It would be a
  breathless experience even to hear a man talk in as slap-dash a style as
  Cobbett wrote; but the thing would be brilliant as well as breathless.
  Everything comes into this great soliloquy: details, dogmas, personalities,
  political debates, private memories, mere exclamations such as a man utters
  in really riding along a road. But through all there is the assumption that
  heaven has appointed him, or he has appointed himself (and perhaps he was too
  prone to confuse the conditions), to be a sort of national surveyor of the
  whole land of England and publish his report to the world. His notes simply
  as notes never fail to be amusing. Anybody with his wits about him may well
  read Cobbett for amusement, even when there is no question of agreement. He
  could make great buildings and even landscapes look ludicrous, like
  landscapes of topsy-turvydom, when he turned on them that Gargantuan grin. We
  shall note later how for him great London was simply; 'the Wen,' a big boil
  and repulsive eruption on the body politic. We shall see how Old Sarum was
  'the Accursed Hill.' He made the Martello towers look even sillier than they
  look now. Nothing was ever better in its way than the dramatic derision with
  which he pointed at the canal at Hythe, and told the people that this was
  meant to keep out the French armies-that had just crossed the Rhine and the
  Danube. More questionable, but equally laughable, was his irreverent picture
  of the fortifications on the cliffs of Dover; which he described, with a sort
  of impudent innocence, as a hill full of holes to hide Englishmen from
  Frenchmen. So simple a view of the science of fortification it is perhaps
  needless to maintain; but even here we have the sort of cranky common sense
  that was never far distant from Cobbett, even when he was talking about what
  he did not in the least understand; as when he pointed out that it was very
  unlikely that the French would try to land on a precipice at Dover when they
  had the whole flat stretch away to East Sussex and the levels of Rye and
  Pevensey, where all the conquerors had landed since history began.</p>

  <p>He had hatreds that seemed too big for their object; like his loathing of
  tea and potatoes. But in his hate there was humour, and even conscious
  humour. Many social reformers who have a hankering after his principles would
  be much distressed by his prejudices. But it was one of his principles to
  have such prejudices. Nor indeed is it an unintelligent or unintelligible
  principle. He believed in the traditions of the past and the instincts of the
  people. And these things have always moved along generalisations, touching
  certain social types or local atmospheres. You cannot have that sort of
  common sense of the countryside if it is not allowed to say that Yorkshiremen
  are this or Kentishmen are that, or that one course is the best way with
  Gypsies or another the usual habit of Jews. Most people are still allowed to
  express these general impressions, until they come to the case of the Jews.
  There (for some reason I have never understood), the whole natural tendency
  has been to stop; and anybody who says anything whatever about Jews as Jews
  is supposed to wish to burn them at the stake. Cobbett was so exceedingly and
  almost alarmingly hearty in the expression of his dislikes that he can hardly
  be said to have laboured to remove the last impression. For anybody whose
  horror of persecution has not yet entirely destroyed his sense of humour,
  nothing could be more exhilarating than the passage in which Cobbett, having
  heard a Methodist preaching in a village, and being afterwards shown an
  antiquated pair of stocks on the village green, comments indignantly on the
  incongruity, the inconsequence, the intellectual outrage of having these two
  things so near to each other and not bringing the two things together into
  one harmonious whole.</p>

  <p>The primary picturesqueness of his work has therefore something of the
  knockabout farce or even pantomime; like Mr. Punch, he fights with the
  cudgel, the heavy but humorous and relatively even humane English weapon.
  When he hits our noble lords and learned judges such thundering cracks, we
  have the same causes of consolation as in the case of Punch and Judy. We have
  reason to know the weapon is made of wood. We have still better reason to
  know the heads are made of wood. All this superficial and broad farce must be
  allowed for first as part of the fun. He got a great deal of fun out of it,
  and we get a great deal of fun out of him; even if it is not only his foes
  who are made to look a little funny. But to be content with considering this
  pantomimic energy is to miss the paradox and therefore miss the point. The
  interesting thing is that this swashbuckler who, as we say, put on so much
  side had very notably another side; which might be called a soft side. But it
  was also decidedly a sober side. For instance, he who was the most impatient
  of men was the most patient of fathers. He was even the most patient of
  schoolmasters. The ploughman was capable of plodding as well as kicking. He
  could be not only soft but even subtle; and if we read the Rural Rides a
  second time, so to speak, we shall see certain things that are the moral of
  the book: and were never put there by a mere bully.</p>

  <p>For instance, there is the educational element in him. Cobbett was a
  demagogue in the literal sense; that is, he was a demagogue in the dignified
  sense. He was a mob-leader; but he was not merely a man mob-led. He certainly
  was not a man merely seeking to ingratiate himself with the crowd, or indeed
  with anybody else. At least, if he were supposed to be ingratiating himself,
  he must be credited with a curious and original selection of words with which
  to do it. But the truth is that it was not his words but his ideas that were
  curious and original. He wished to arouse a mob, or if you will a rabble, to
  support those ideas; but not to support any ideas&mdash;least of all to
support
  any ideas that they might happen to have already. Fundamentally and almost
  unconsciously he was indeed appealing to popular instincts that were not only
  equally fundamental but equally unconscious. But in the mere form and method
  of his utterance, he was much more disposed to ram information down their
  throats than to take hints from their faces. If he was in his way demagogic,
  he was much more definitely didactic. Education was an enthusiasm with him:
  from teaching economics as he taught French by a sort of public
  correspondence, to helping his own little boy with a horn-book. But while he
  was in private the very gentlest of teachers, he was in public, when talking
  to a crowd of farmers instead of to a little boy, the most violent and even
  offensive; to the child he was rather persuasive than didactic, and to the
  men not so much didactic as dictatorial.</p>

  <p>We have already noted something of the sort about the English Grammar. He
  was a logician as well as a grammarian. He was the last man in the world to
  be really a pedant. He would always have preferred splitting infinitives to
  splitting straws. These criticisms of diction are also criticisms of thought;
  or of absence of thought. This was the period of which it used to be said,
  with all solemnity, that an English statesman never quite recovered from
  having uttered a false quantity in a Latin quotation in early life. It sounds
  like a parody on the secret sin of the mysterious baronet; but indeed he
  recovered easily enough from deserting the village maiden; and he never tried
  to recover from being drunk. Under these circumstances, Cobbett was surely
  justified in suggesting that too much notice was taken of a false quantity in
  Latin, and too little of a false quality in English. To some it may seem a
  rather remote question whether the English statesman in talking Latin
  accented it right, considering that he almost certainly pronounced it wrong:
  But in any ease Cobbett, if we may extend the metaphor, always threw the
  moral accent far back and let it fall on the root of the word. In that and
  many other respects he was really a Radical.</p>

  <p>But our concern here is not so much with whether it was correct as with
  whether it was characteristic. Of course, if Cobbett had treated any abstract
  science it would have become a concrete science. If he had merely undertaken
  to set out the multiplication table it would have run: 'Twice one useless
  regiment is two useless regiments; twice two venal Ministers is four venal
  Ministers; twice three pluralistic parsonages is six pluralistic parsonages
  like those possessed by the Reverend Mr. Hugg of Netherwallop,' and so on. If
  he had set out a system of astronomy, and had merely to give the names of the
  stars, he would have been unable to mention Mars without saying something
  caustic about Lord Wellington or Mercury, without a few contemporary
  illustrations of the connection between commerce and theft. No icy
  abstractions could freeze out that ferocious familiarity. It is said that the
  discoverer of the North Pole would see a Scotsman's cap on it; certainly the
  sight of that cap would fill Cobbett with sentiments sufficient to keep him
  warm. On that side the grammatical experiment illustrates only his obvious
  pugnacity; his tendency to personify everything in order to pelt it with
  personalities. But it illustrates something else as well. And it is exactly
  that something else that seems in a sense contrary, and yet is the completion
  of the character, without which it cannot be understood.</p>

  <p>There was something cool about Cobbett, for all his fire; and that was his
  educational instinct, his love of alphabetical and objective teaching. He was
  a furious debater; but he was a mild and patient schoolmaster. His dogmatism
  left off where most dogmatism begins. He would always bully an equal; but he
  would never have bullied a pupil. Put a child before him to be taught
  arithmetic or the use of the globes, and he became in the most profound and
  even touching sense a different man. There came about him like a cold air out
  of the clean heavens, cooling his hot head, something that counted with him
  more than it does with most men; something about which we hear perhaps too
  much now as too little then; something that only too easily provides
  perorations for politicians or themes for ethical societies; but something
  which does exist in some men and did emphatically exist in this one. The pure
  passion of education went through him like a purging wind; he thirsted to
  tell young people about things-not about theories or parties or political
  allegations, but about things. Whether they were grammatical roots or
  vegetable roots or cube roots, he wanted to dig them up; to show them and to
  share them. He had the schoolmaster's enthusiasm for being followed, for
  being understood; his inmost ideal was a sort of white-hot lucidity. He above
  all men made the appeal: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear; though he
  was too prone to decorate with very long ears the rivals who would certainly
  refuse to hear. But the dunces were the dons. There was no dunce in the class
  he taught; for the whole fury of his genius was poured into simplifying his
  lesson to suit it to the village idiot.</p>

  <p>For this reason also, and not only for the other, he had decorated his
  Grammar with grotesque caricatures. He was resolved to make English grammar
  amusing; and he did. It is not true that his only pleasure was in execrating
  somebody or even exposing something. Stronger even than these was his
  rational rapture in explaining something. He had learnt that in order to
  explain something it is necessary to hold the attention; and his examples
  always do hold the attention. In some ways, therefore, the two contrary
  forces in him come together, more than anywhere, in this strange volume; in
  what some would call this mad text-book.</p>

  <p>But he appears as a better because a broader teacher in the Rural Rides.
  He really had a great talent for teaching; in the real sense in which a
  schoolmaster like a poet is born and not made. He could go back with the
  beginner to the beginnings. He could understand the pupil's failure to
  understand. He would take trouble to make everything mean something, and sift
  the language for terms to which other terms could be reduced. A model of
  educational method may be found in his little talk with the farmhand at
  Beaulieu Abbey. Most educated men, even of a didactic turn, would be content
  to tell the man that, it was spelt Beaulieu but pronounced Buley, and leave
  the man merely puzzled. At best they would have told him that Beau is the
  French for fine and lieu the French for place; and left him with an arbitrary
  fact fallen out of the air, like the Hebrew word for hat or the Chinese word
  for umbrella. But Cobbett really translated the words, making them part of
  the man's own language. He pointed out that even in English we talk of a beau
  when we mean a buck or dandy; and talk of taking goods in lieu of money when
  we mean in place of money. There is not one educated man in a thousand who
  would think of those illustrations to make things clear to a yokel in a lane;
  and the man who habitually talked like that was one of the great
  schoolmasters of the world.</p>

  <p>It is quite impossible to pick up all the varied and vivid trifles that
  are scattered through the Rural Rides. It would be undesirable even if it
  were not impossible. It would be saving the reader the trouble of reading the
  book; and it ought to be no trouble. The man who does not find one of
  Cobbett's books amusing is doomed to find every book dull. They contain a
  hundred fragments from which the whole habit of his life has been built up.
  They show him to us in a series of snapshots, in attitudes so active as to
  amount to the animation of a cinema. We can picture him swaggering about on
  his own farm at Botley, in the red waistcoat that he wore so appropriately,
  like a defiance to a whole herd of bulls. We can watch him peering over
  fences and hedges in his eager and shameless vanity, enquiring everywhere
  about Cobbett's Corn (the name he modestly gave to the maize he brought from
  America), and sternly admonishing those who were unconscious of their good
  luck in possessing it. We can behold him as he curses London from the hills;
  he always called it the Wen. But here again his humour is more subtle than it
  seems. We have noticed the same offhand offensiveness in his quotations in
  the English Grammar. With his artless artistry, he gives more weight to this
  abusive term by using it not so much abusively as allusively. Instead of
  saying, 'This vile city is only one monstrous Wen,' he is careful to say
  quite carelessly, 'I was coming from the Wen,' as if he were saying, 'I was
  coming from the Wood.' He seems to assume that everybody knows it by that
  name. It is impossible, I say, to deal with all these details; we can only
  pick out one or two because they are symbolic and consider the social view
  they symbolise.</p>

  <p>For instance, we can see that even as a reactionary he was a realist. An
  excellent example of Cobbett's general attitude may be found in his view of
  fairs and markets. This is especially true in that his attitude is
  emphatically not what most of his critics and some of his supporters would
  suppose. On the theory that he was a sort of retrospective rustic, merely
  regretting the good old times, it would be easy enough to make a picture of
  such a sentimental veteran recalling the romance of his youth at fair and
  market. But Cobbett is really concerned with the business of the market, and
  not merely with the fun of the fair. He does not imagine that village maidens
  pass their whole lives dancing round the Maypole. Some of the later romantics
  of Young England would have been quite capable of making them set up a
  Maypole at Christmas, perhaps with a Christmas pudding on top of it. He does
  not even cling to that yet nobler pillar of Christendom, the greasy-pole with
  a leg of mutton on top of it; more truly Christian because offering more
  opportunities for a cheerful humility. He does not see it as an old-world
  pageant, in the manner of Ruskin or William Morris. He sees it as an economic
  question as strictly as Ricardo or John Stuart Mill. Only, rightly or
  wrongly, he turns the economic argument the other way. It is also quite
  typical of him that his economics are really economical. He does not
  primarily praise the fair as a place in which people can spend money. He
  actually praises it as a way in which they can save money. And his argument,
  whether we agree with it or not, is perfectly practical and prosaic. I do not
  mean, of course, that he would not sympathise with the Maypole and the
  greasy-pole; for he certainly would. I do not mean that he would not enjoy
  the enjoyment, for he certainly did. He had a pretty taste in pretty girls,
  as have many men who are quite happy with their own wives; he would certainly
  have liked to see them dancing round a Maypole; though perhaps he would not
  have been sufficiently modern and advanced to enjoy seeing one of them
  asserting sex equality and making her own career by climbing the greasy pole.
  He would have entirely sympathised with the girl whose lover lingered at the
  fair, when he had promised to buy her a bunch of blue ribbons, as it says in
  the song, to tie up her bonny brown hair. Perhaps, again, he would have been
  so old-fashioned as to doubt whether the girl would gain very much by never
  buying ribbon for her hair, but only ribbon for her typewriter. But all this
  was a matter of light sentiment with him; and he was quite sane enough to
  take his sentiment lightly. The basis of his argument was in no sense
  sentimental; it was perfectly practical as far as it went. It was that the
  young man would not have to pay so much for ribbons for the young woman,
  because the person selling the ribbons would not have to pay so much for
  building or renting a shop. Somebody somewhere else, he argued, living in an
  ordinary cottage and garden, would make the ribbons at home, as the old
  country lace makers made lace, and would then walk into the nearest
  market-town and sell them to the young; man, who had also walked into the
  same market-town to buy them. The young woman would get her ribbons, and the
  n young man would have so much more left to go towards Cottage Economy and
  the expenses of married life, which do not consist entirely of the purchase
  of ribbons. But suppose (Cobbett's argument ran) the cottage woman, instead
  of working in her own cottage in her own way, had to go to a special place
  for working, all the expenses of that place must be thrown in. Suppose the
  cottage woman has to come into the market and put up four walls and a roof in
  order to sell a ribbon. The expenses of the shop are also added to the
  expenses of the ribbon; and the young woman has fewer ribbons or (more
  probably) less housekeeping money. I am not now arguing whether this economic
  argument is sound. I am only pointing out that this economic argument is
  economic. Cobbett seldom felt comfortable unless his strongest sentimental
  instincts had some such solid foundation. I think on the whole the argument
  is quite sound as far as it goes; and it goes a good way, until we come into
  the world of such very large and very lifeless mass production that things
  can be produced cheaply, especially by huge and rich monopolies by which they
  can even be, for some time, produced at a loss. In other words, it probably
  is true that one big millionaire might own one big machine with wheels
  incessantly going round and reeling off interminable lengths of the same very
  ugly ribbon; and that he might even sell it below cost price for the pleasure
  of driving every other sort of better and more varied ribbon out of the
  market. But some (including the present writer) do not like monopolies of
  that kind or machines of that kind, or millionaires of that kind, or even
  ribbons of that kind; and some of us even decline under any circumstances to
  use them to tie up our bonny brown hair. In any case, in this sketch we are
  concerned less with controversy than with character; and it is essential to
  the character of Cobbett that he believed that a market was better than a
  shop, not merely because it was brighter or quainter or more picturesque, but
  because he thought it was cheaper. It must be noted as marking him off from
  the romantic reactionary, and even from the school of Ruskin when it
  denounced the economical tendency of economics. We can all sympathise with
  what Ruskin' meant by the Lamp of Sacrifice. Even Cobbett could have
  sympathised, as his love of the great Gothic churches had shown; but if he
  had been arranging such an allegorical illumination, he would probably have
  added a Lamp of Thrift.</p>

  <p>In this limited and definite sense he did object to England being a nation
  of shopkeepers. Today, of course, England is most unmistakably not a nation
  of shopkeepers. I myself, in a moment of controversial exaggeration,
  described it as a nation of shopwalkers. But anyhow, it is obvious that the
  process which Cobbett condemned has not only gone far beyond anything that he
  described, but has gone far enough to destroy itself, as a thing covered by
  that description. If ownership be the test, it has been a process and a
  period of people losing things and not gaining them. It has been a process of
  people going into service, in the language of servants, into service if not
  into servitude. It has been a process of people losing even the little booth
  at the fair, that was thought so poor a substitute for the little farm in the
  fields. Somewhat sadly we can now toss away from us the taunt of our great
  enemy. By the best proof of all, the English are not a nation of shopkeepers.
  They have not kept their shops.</p>

  <p>But the point here is that Cobbett was not weeping over lost causes; he
  was rather if anything raving over lost cash: or at anyrate lost capital. He
  was perfectly practical; but he was sorry that the small capitalists were
  being ruined; and in the long run he may possibly turn out to be right. As we
  have said, he was emphatically not a mere laudator temporis acti. He was not
  merely crying over spilt milk; he was crying for justice over stolen cows.
  But he was not reckless in the sense of a friend to recklessness: on the
  contrary, he felt that such a licence to theft was the end of thrift. He gave
  his enemies beans, as the saying is, but he knew how many beans make five:
  and even counted them carefully.</p>

  <p>It is curious that men of the type of Brougham were always lecturing the
  poor on foresight, when the one thing they could not do was to foresee the
  future of the poor. They were always urging them to thrift and urging them to
  set up a system which would make it impossible to be thrifty. Those who used
  the word thrift twenty times a day never looked at the word once. If they
  had, they would have seen that thrift depends upon thriving. In Shakespeare,
  it is used as practically meaning property or wealth; 'where thrift may
  follow fawning.' Unfortunately, in a modern plutocracy it can only follow
  fawning. It certainly cannot follow saving. A servant who is agreeably
  servile may possibly have a fortune by favouritism. But by no possibility
  could he save enough out of common wages to buy a farm, still less a shop in
  the town where land is priceless; and those are the sort of things for which
  men save. But it is the paradox of the whole position that the Utilitarians
  who were always preaching prudence committed this country to one of the most
  really reckless revolutions in history&mdash;the industrial revolution. They
  destroyed agriculture and turned England into a workshop; a workshop in which
  the workers were liable at any moment to be locked up and left to eat hammers
  and saws. The Radicals who did that were as picturesque as pirates, so far as
  pirates become specially picturesque when they burn their boats. In truth
  they were not so much metaphorically burning their boats: they were almost
  literally burning their barns. But there is something fitting in the accident
  by which the term Free Trader used to mean a smuggler. If romantic
  recklessness be the test, Cobden and Bright should always have appeared
  brandishing cutlasses and with a belt full of pistols.</p>

  <p>But Cobbett did really value foresight; Cobbett did really believe in
  forethought; Cobbett did really believe in thrift. He was ever ready to urge
  a wise economy of expenditure with the wildest extravagance of words. He
  praised prudence in a series of the most appallingly imprudent speeches ever
  made by man. He howled and bellowed all the beauties of a sober and sensible
  and quiet life. But he was perfectly sincere; and it was really thrift and
  forethought and sobriety that he recommended. Only, it was the trouble with
  his forethought that it was, among other things, thought; and of his
  foresight that he could see a little further. He could see a little further
  than his nose; or that supercilious nose on which the spectacles of the
  economist were balanced. He saw that even when the economists were right in
  recommending economy, they were recommending it to people who could not
  possibly be economical. He saw that the economists were not even creating
  their own monster of an Economic Man; they were creating nothing but the
  thriftless thousands of a wandering proletariat. As for the ordinary Whigs
  and champions of Reform, he did not believe they were even trying to create
  anything except salaries and sinecures for themselves.</p>

  <p>Then again, his coarseness is not only touched by shrewdness but by
  tenderness; of a sort much too shrewd to be sentimental. His charity was not
  cheap. To say that he had a sense of human equality will convey little to
  those who can make no sense of that sense. Perhaps it would be more
  intelligible to say that there are some who sympathise with the poor from the
  outside and some who can sympathise from the inside. There is one kind of man
  who pities a beggar because the beggar is so different from himself, and
  another who does it because the beggar is so similar. Many a perfectly
  sincere reformer will say, 'Imagine a man starving in such a slum,' as he
  would say, 'Imagine a man being really boiled by cannibals in a pot,' or,
  'Imagine that a man really was-chopped in pieces by Chinese torturers.' His
  phrase is a piece of perfectly honest rhetoric; but he knows that we do not
  really imagine it. But when Cobbett writes about it, we do imagine it. He
  does not deal in lurid description; in this matter he is rather unusually
  responsible and reasonable. He simply has the knack of making the thing
  happen to himself and therefore to his reader. There is an excellent
  illustration of his quieter method in one passage in the Rural Rides. He
  describes, in that plain and almost naked narrative style that seems to lie
  like strong morning daylight upon every detail of the day, how he started out
  riding with his son at dawn; how some hitch occurred about the inn at which
  he had intended to breakfast, and he rode on hoping to reach another hostelry
  in reasonable time; how other hitches occurred which annoyed him, making him
  scold the boy for some small blunders about the strapping of a bag; and how
  he awoke at last to a sort of wonder as to why he should be so irritable with
  a child whom he loved so much. And then it dawned upon him that it was for
  the very simple reason that he had had no breakfast. He, who had fed well the
  night before and intended to feed well again, who was well clothed and well
  mounted, could not deny that a good appetite might gradually turn into a bad
  temper. And then, with one of his dramatic turns or gestures, he suddenly
  summons up before us all the army of Englishmen who had no hope of having any
  breakfast until they could somehow beg work from hard or indifferent men; who
  wandered about the world in a normal state of hunger and anger and blank
  despair about the future; who were exposed to every insult and impotent under
  every wrong; and who were expected by the politicians and the papers to be
  perfectly mild and moderate in their language, perfectly loyal and
  law-abiding in their sentiments, to invoke blessings on all who were more
  fortunate and respectfully touch their hats to anybody who had a little more
  money.</p>

  <p>Now, the unconscious ingenuity of that approach is that it surprises us
  from the inside. The man writing it has not struck any attitudes of a
  demagogue or a prophet of woe; he has not set out to describe slums as a
  missionary to describe savages. The man reading it does not know what is
  coming; but when it comes it comes to him and not to some remote stranger. It
  is he that feels the sinking within him that comes from the withdrawal of all
  our, bodily supports; it is his own stomach that is hollow and his own heart
  that is sick with hope deferred. It will be all the better for him if it is
  his own brain that grows black and his own tongue bitter; if it teaches him
  for a moment what it must be to be a tramp walking with pain and bludgeoned
  by perpetual snubs and sneers and refusals. When a man has imagined that for
  a moment for himself, he knows for the first time what is meant by saying
  that men are brothers, and not merely poor relations. That is the
  psychological experience corresponding to the philosophical doctrine which
  for many remains a mystery: the equality of man.</p>

  <p>It must also always be remembered, if we are to make any meaning of the
  tale, that it was this type of the very poor man, the tramp or the beggar,
  whom Cobbett almost unconsciously made the test of the time. He was not the
  man for whom it was possible to represent it as a good time. He was not the
  man who was being tolerated by toleration acts or enfranchised by reform
  bills. He was not the man who was being educated by Brougham's popular
  science or equipped by Arkwright's mechanical discoveries. He was not one of
  those whom the new world was making richer. As Cobbett would have put it in
  his bitter way, he had not the advantage of being a Jew who blasphemed Christ
  or a Quaker who ran away from patriotism. He was only a normal national
  baptized Englishman with nothing to eat. He was only a poor man; and he was
  quite certainly growing poorer.</p>

  <p>Tyranny varies with temperament, especially national temperament. Some
  have taxed the poor, and some have enslaved the poor, and a few have
  massacred the poor; but the English rulers simply forgot the poor. They
  talked as if they did not exist; they generalised as if no such people need
  be included in the generalisation. They drew up reports of progress and
  prosperity in which the common people did not figure at all. They did not
  suppress the subject; by that time they simply did not think of it any more
  than a man shooting pheasants prides himself on killing flies or an angler
  counts the midges. It was said that the English founded an empire in a fit of
  absence of mind. It must be somewhat sadly added that they neglected a nation
  with the same absence of mind. Oligarchies far harsher and more arbitrary in
  legal form would probably have more responsibility in the sense of
  remembrance. A Roman official might have written in a famine, 'There is still
  food enough for the citizens and even the slaves.' A Victorian gentleman in
  the Hungry Forties simply sat down at his groaning mahogany and said, 'There
  is enough food.' A planter in South Carolina might well have been heard
  saying, 'The Blockade is starving the blacks as well as ourselves,' The
  merchant in Manchester was only heard saying, 'There may be a slump; but with
  the next boom we shall completely recover ourselves.' That is the mental
  blank peculiar to this mentality. They did not even look down with scorn and
  say, 'We are all comfortable, even if these vagabonds are beggared by their
  own vices.' They looked round with complete satisfaction and said, 'We are
  all comfortable.'</p>

  <p>This distinction is simply a fact, and should not be mixed up with moral
  or sentimental recriminations. It is a character of the condition called
  capitalism, whether we dwell on the economic dependence or the political
  independence of the worker under capitalism. In part, doubtless, the
  proletarian was forgotten because he was free. The slave was remembered
  because he was always under the eye of the master. But I am not now arguing
  about whether nineteenth century capitalism has been better or worse than
  slavery. I am pointing out that the whole business of hiring men and sacking
  men did allow of forgetting men. It allowed of it much more than the servile
  system of owning men. Capitalism has produced a peculiar thing, which may be
  called oppression by oblivion. And this negative and indirect injustice was
  native both to what is good and what is bad in the English temper. It is the
  paradox of the English that they are always being cruel through an aversion
  to cruelty. They dislike quite sincerely the sight of pain, and therefore
  shut their eyes to it; and it was not unnatural that they should prefer a
  system in which men were starved in slums but not scourged in
  slave-compounds.</p>

  <p>Now, here again we have one of the subtleties under the superficial
  simplicities of Rural Rides. Cobbett, it has been often repeated, was as
  English as any Englishman who ever lived. He had all the English virtues: the
  love of loafing and of lonely adventure; the spirit of the genial eccentric;
  the capacity to be a hermit without being a misanthrope; the love of
  landscape and of roads astray; and above all, that love of the grotesque that
  is as brave as a broad grin. Nor, as we say, was he without that softer side,
  only that with him it was generally the inside. I mean that it was in his
  private and domestic character that we see the English aversion to what is
  painful and severe. He was a very gentle father and schoolmaster, not only in
  practice but in theory; and much that he wrote on education almost
  anticipates the complete amnesty of the Montessori school, He always
  expressed himself strongly about the stupidity of schoolmasters knocking
  children about, though he did it with a cheerful readiness to knock the
  schoolmasters about. Here he does indeed touch something in the English that
  is behind their dislike of a scene. Victor Hugo in his Art of being a
  Grandfather describes in his rather boastful fashion how he had lashed the
  world like Isaiah or Juvenal, and refused to descend to the bathos of
  slapping a child. Cobbett had lashed the world like nobody in the world but
  Cobbett. And he had a better right than Hugo to say truly of himself that
  'thunder should be mild at home.'</p>

  <p>But when all this element in the great Englishman has been allowed for, it
  is still true that there was one quality in him that was not English. He was
  extremely provocative. He was as provocative as an. Irishman. He refused to
  leave people alone. He refused emphatically to let sleeping dogs lie. It is
  not surprising that at the end he had the whole pack in full cry after him;
  and that it only gave him a further opportunity for turning on them and
  telling them they were all curs and mongrels, not to mention mad dogs. He
  always trailed his coat, especially so as to make men say that he had turned
  his coat. He rejoiced and exulted in a scene. There is nothing more vivid
  than that scene on which Mr. Edward Thomas touched with great felicity, the
  great meeting which Cobbett had worked up to the point of a passionate
  enthusiasm for throwing him out. 'I stood up,' he says,'that they might see
  the man they had to throw out.' That phrase is a photograph before the days
  of photography; the picture of that big, snorting, bellicose farmer, standing
  up with distended nostrils and the expression which in the prize ring is
  called being a glutton.</p>

  <p>Now, the combination in Cobbett of the deepest English humours and the
  love and understanding of England with this quality which is rare in England,
  the aggressive and challenging quality, is a sort of coincidence or
  contradiction which gave him his whole value in our politics and history. It
  was exactly because he was English in everything else, and not English in
  this, that he did serve England, and very nearly saved England. He very
  nearly saved her from that oppression by oblivion, that absent-minded cruelty
  of the mere capitalist, which has now brought upon her such accumulated and
  appalling problems in the industrial world. He was capable of being candid
  about cruelty; and indeed of being cruel about cruelty. He would not let
  sleeping dogs lie; he also would not let progressive politicians lie. While a
  rather oily optimism was being applied like oil, lie rubbed in his pessimism
  like pepper. To a society that was more and more covering itself up with its
  own superficial success, he was always deliberately digging up the mass of
  submerged failure. To use a metaphor that would have appealed to him, he was
  always refusing to judge our society by the top-layer of apples or
  strawberries in the basket, and always declaring that the shopkeeper was a
  swindler and the fruit underneath was rotten. While the whole of that version
  of things afterwards called Victorian was gently pressing everybody to judge
  England by an idealised version of the public schoolboy and the gentleman, he
  delighted to pester our very imagination with beggars and tramps. While the
  New Poor Law was putting away such people in prisons and police institutions,
  he delighted to exhibit them with all their sores like the cripples on the
  steps of a church in Italy.</p>

  <p>But though in this he was an exception among Englishmen, he was still an
  English exception among Englishmen. The distinction should be understood;
  somewhat in the same sense, in spite of what is said to the contrary, a man
  like Parnell was an exception among Irishmen, but a purely Irish exception.
  Cobbett represented one piece of England awake where much of England was
  asleep: he represented certain English things in revolt that are commonly in
  repose. But his way of reaching even these was very national; since it was
  very casual and almost entirely experimental. He did not start with theories
  but with things; with the things he saw. A philosophy can be deduced from his
  comments; but we do not feel that they were deduced from a philosophy.</p>

  <p>Lastly, he embodied the English paradox: because he was a sort of poet
  whose ideal was prose. He was easily infuriated; and he would have been
  immensely infuriated at being called a poet; or, still more, being called a
  mystic. But there was much more poetry in him than he knew. There was even
  much more mysticism in him than he knew; for a simple man is a mystery to
  himself. And nothing is more notable in the great panorama of the Rural Rides
  than the fact that he often sees things in an epical and symbolical fashion
  which others saw in a very material or mechanical fashion. To take only one
  instance: all the books and speeches and pamphlets of the latter period of
  his life are full of allusions to Old Sarum. It was, of course, the
  outstanding, not to say outrageous example of the anomalies of the unreformed
  representative system; a place that had practically ceased to exist without
  ceasing to send legislators to make laws for England. There are any number of
  jokes and anecdotes and debates and diatribes about Old Sarum; but they are
  all concerned with it as something on a map or even in a table of figures.
  The joke is an abstract and arithmetical joke. The idea of anybody going to
  Old Sarum would seem somehow like going to the Other End of Nowhere. It is
  intensely characteristic of Cobbett that for him alone Old Sarum was a place;
  and because it happened to be a high and hilly place, it stood up in his
  imagination with the monstrosity of a mountain. He called it the Accursed
  Hill. That single title, compared with the terms used by, pamphleteers and
  politicians, has in it something of the palpable apocalypse. We can fancy him
  seeing it afar off from some terrace of hills looking over the coloured
  counties, as some primitive traveller might have fancied he saw afar off the
  peak of Purgatory, or the volcanic prison of the Titans. He hated it not as
  arithmetical anomalies can be hated; but as places can be hated, which is
  almost as persons can be hated. And in all this, as compared with the
  contemporary rationalism, there was more mysticism precisely because there
  was more materialism. There is almost in such a combination a sort of
  sacrament of hate. His feeling about the sin and shame of Sarum was of the
  same moral type as the feeling about the sanctity of the other Sarum, which
  might have been felt by some ardent devotee of the Use of Sarum. But in that
  sense Cobbett could not see the u se of Sarum.</p>

  <p>This imaginative quality in the man is all the more interesting because it
  is partly unconscious and partly suppressed. In so far as he had an
  imaginative concept of himself, we might almost say it was the concept of not
  being imaginative. Even the world which has understood him so little has at
  least understood that he was essentially and emphatically English. But
  perhaps the most English thing about him was that he contrived by sheer
  poetry to picture himself as prosaic. He was so imaginative that he imagined
  himself to be merely a plain man. This is really an illusion that explains
  much of the history of John Bull; as indeed it explains the whole legend and
  ideal of John Bull. As poets dream not of a poet but of a hero, so a nation
  of poets has called up as its ideal the vision of a practical man. But in
  Cobbett's time, and especially in Cobbett's case, what there was of illusion
  in this was quite innocent; and he did not know that there was anything
  spiritual or elemental about him. That universe that exists in the brain of
  every man was then rather by way of being a buried universe; and those were
  few who, like Blake and Swedenborg, dived after its submerged stars. In the
  Age of Reason there was some tendency for the soul to become the
  subconsciousness. Cobbett certainly was cheerfully unconscious of having any
  subeonsciousness. I shudder to think what would have happened to anybody who
  had told him he had a complex; and indeed there was very little complex about
  him. In that sense he believed in reason as rigidly as Tom Paine; and the
  world in which he moves over downland and dale and country town is eternally
  in the broad daylight. But there is one passage in that practical pilgrimage
  in which we do get a glimpse of those deeper things, at once more dark and
  more illuminated. It is all the more moving because it comes quite without
  warning in the middle of that quiet and unpretentious narrative, and with one
  turn takes on the character of some terrible allegory. There is something
  about it mysterious and macabre, like a dark woodcut of Albert Durer.</p>

  <p>He describes how he came in his careful wanderings to a district in which
  the large estates had been reorganised by new landlords of a certain kind;
  landlords named Ricardo and Baring and other rather foreign and financial
  names, whom he was wont to name very frankly. All day his heart had grown
  heavier with the increasing sense that the country was passing into the hands
  of these oriental merchants, and he was probably brooding, as he often did,
  on the very darkest version of their history and character, when he saw a
  strange object or ornament or accident standing up in those smooth and
  well-ordered grounds neatly fenced from the road. It was actually in the
  shape of a cross; 'big enough and broad enough to crucify a man on.' With
  something that makes his staccato style sound for the first time like broken
  speech, he repeats more than once, 'Aye, big enough and broad enough to
  crucify a man on.' And then he says that his horse, who was accustomed to the
  ambling trot with which he rambled about for his adventures, was startled by
  the spur or the gesture which urged him to sudden activity. He must have
  gone, he says, at a great and very uncommon pace as he got away from that
  place. 'I think he [meaning the horse] must often have wondered what gave me
  wings that once and that once only.'</p>

  <p>That curious incident is all the more impressive because Cobbett tells it
  with powerful restraint and saying as little as may be of its emotional side.
  He who flung fierce words about like a fury slinging flame, always had a
  rather fine instinct of sobriety and simplicity when it came to the few
  things, rather in the background of his mind, which he did really though
  vaguely reverence. But in this ease something rather more unusual and even
  uncanny was involved. A man has been pottering about from farm to farm and
  town to town on a trotting horse, inspecting crops, making notes about wages,
  cocking an eye at the weather and calling for a glass of ale at the inn; but
  all with the sense that this older England is passing away, and feeling it
  more and more as he comes nearer to Surrey and the suburbs, or to the great
  new estates run by the new gentry. Their names are strange names; and he has
  suspicions that even those names are not always their own. Their faces are
  strange faces; associated in his mind with sketches of eastern travel or with
  pictures in the family Bible. They are very busy; very orderly; in their own
  way very philanthropic. But what are they doing, what are they driving at,
  what is the ultimate design by which they build? There lies like a load upon
  him the impression that the whole world is being reformed; and it is being
  reformed wrong. The world's great age begins anew; and it begins wrong. He
  cannot think where it will all end; what form so foreign and perhaps formless
  a growth is ultimately meant to take. And then he sees, standing up quite
  neat and new and solid in the sunlight, something that seems crude and
  freshly carpentered and yet frightfully familiar; not a. symbol but rather a
  substantial purpose; not an emblem but an end. And we know not what shock of
  revelation or revulsion all but unhorsed that strong rider as on the road to
  Damascus; something indescribable, overwhelming a plain man in a passion of
  subtleties, that had no outlet but a rush of flight; and far away down the
  darkling English lanes the throb and thunder of the flying hooves. For that
  unholy cross the heathen saw stood up still ugly and unsanctified; black
  against the daybreak of the world, the shape of shame; and saving such a
  strange flash of reversion, the cross no Christian will ever see.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">VII.&mdash;LAST DAYS AND DEATH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A mere outline of the career of Cobbett has been broken or
  interrupted here for the sake of two studies of his literary personality.
  That outline left him in England after his second return from the United
  States. The time of his return was largely the time of his triumph; in spite
  of, or rather because of, the tumultuous hour in which he returned. In this
  period he received all the highest compliments which he was ever likely to
  receive. He was hailed as a democratic deliverer, not only by his own natural
  following among the farm-labourers of the southern shires, but by the grim
  and growing power of the Trades Unions of the Midlands and the North. He was
  given a great public banquet and toasted with tremendous enthusiasm. He was
  invited, in many times and places daring these later years, to stand for
  Parliament. He was eventually elected to Parliament. If the Reform Government
  had really been a Reform Government, he might have been a Minister in it or
  received any honour that popular government could bestow. In any case he
  received, in this his time of honour, the highest of all these honours. He
  was prosecuted by the Government for sedition.</p>

  <p>But the man in the dock was a very different person from the dazed and
  disillusioned Tory farmer who had once stood distracted between the doom
  hanging over his farm and the doom hanging over his country. He stood in the
  dock like a man risen from the dead. He was an incarnate and historic revenge
  that had renewed its youth like the eagle's. He was far younger than when he
  was young. If it was foolish of the politicians to have prosecuted him on the
  first occasion, there is something of the madness that marks the wrath of the
  gods in their repetition of the folly so long afterwards. They were actually
  silly enough to attempt to make him responsible for the Luddites smashing the
  machines. He had not, of course, the smallest difficulty in showing that he
  had actually written to the Luddites asking them not to smash the machines.
  He could and did call Brougham as a witness to prove that his appeal had
  actually been used on the side of law and order. But Cobbett was not likely
  to confine himself to the defensive, with such an opening for a
  counter-offensive. He tore to rags their ridiculous case against him; then he
  drew a deep breath into his great lungs, and they heard his case against
  them. He let himself go; we might say he let himself loose. Tribunals and
  officials had a startling experience of what sort of elemental rage had been
  dwelling among them. He browbeat the browbeating judges; he bullied the
  bullies of the bar; he raised the jury against them like a mob; it was the
  hour of his life. For once at least he could make men understand that he did
  well to be angry; and he did. He spat out his passionate contempt for all
  that cold and cowardly world which had gone about to trap him lest he should
  somewhere let out the truth. He gave its own name to all that bottomless
  baseness in the comfortable classes, that would destroy a man for his
  sympathy with the poor. He swept away all the ridiculous relevancies of
  whether he had said this or that about an election or a trade union, and
  attacked the' thing his enemies were really attacking. He accused them of
  their accusation. He charged them with charging, a man with having a heart
  for the oppressed. He told them why they hated him; and showed them the face
  of their own fear. It was not because he was blatant or inconsistent or
  coarse or reckless; even if he was. It was not because he raged or ranted or
  made a noise. It was because of those silent on whose behalf he made a noise;
  of the dumb for whom he ranted and the impotent for whom he raged. It was his
  love of the poor that made him horrible to his enemies; and in that hour he
  made them feed on the full horrors that such love reveals. When he had done
  shaking the court of justice with his voice, everything around him seemed
  shrunken and silent; the jury acquitted him almost mechanically, and he left
  the court, if not without a stain on his character, at least with a smile on
  his face broader than the grim smile he wore during his sentence to Newgate.
  He might have been dismounting after a holiday ride along the hills, before
  an honest alehouse of his youth. And indeed he had been doing the same thing;
  he had been enjoying himself.</p>

  <p>That hour in the dock was the supreme moment of his life; and though in
  one sense it was followed by more success and popularity than he had
  hitherto, he was never again so near to his own vision of triumph. He became
  more and more identified with the great movement against the rotten boroughs,
  which culminated (or collapsed) with the great Act of 1830. The Reform
  movement united him with many who had once been his friends and with many who
  would always have been his enemies. But the Reform movement was very
  different from the Reform Bill. Cobbett lived to see Reform, but not the
  Reform he had longed to see. He sat in Parliament, but not in the Parliament
  where he wished to sit. The atmosphere he hated most of all, more than any
  smoke of destruction or any smell of decay, the Whig atmosphere, was what
  prevailed in the new Parliament and the new Ministry. If he watched with too
  harsh a sneer its first act of emancipating the niggers by an enormous bribe
  to the nigger-drivers, we may imagine (or fail to imagine) how he regarded
  its second act, which was to complete and extend the most cruel Tudor policy
  against poor vagabonds, by passing the New Poor Law and putting them into
  prisons called workhouses. To a more detached mind there might seem something
  of symmetry and balance in thus simultaneously letting out black people and
  locking up white.</p>

  <p>Before this had happened, of course, and while it was happening, he had
  pursued his other controversial interests, and figured in several other
  fields. He had taken a seed-farm in Kensington: where he conducted an
  experiment in bartering goods for labour, and sold all sorts of things. His
  Register still sold like hot cakes; the cakes continued to be very hot
  indeed. Sonic of them were more than most people could swallow, in the way of
  absolute assertions, positive prophecies, and personal threats. He was by
  this time a great public character; from some points of view a great comic
  character. It is possible that some people tried to take a rise out of him.
  Sometimes the laugh was on his side; sometimes on the other. But this could
  always be said of him, that he stood in the same swaggering attitude whether
  he stood alone or backed by a whole nation. Two examples will serve: of the
  former, the joke about the gridiron; of the latter, an affair that had
  happened earlier-that of the Royal Divorce.</p>

  <p>Certainly Cobbett had a way of brazening things out, whether we think him
  right or wrong; indeed, we cannot but feel a sort of breathless admiration
  especially when we think him wrong. The story of the gridiron which he came
  to carry like a coat-of-arms is an excellent illustration of his invincible
  impudence. It arose out of a trifle, or at anyrate out of a detail; a detail
  which was very doubtful and not at all decisive. The Government had declared,
  in connection with the crisis which necessitated paper money, that things
  would improve, and that certain payments would be made in coin. Cobbett,
  contradicting flatly and flying into a passion, as was his habit about a
  hundred things large and small, had said he would be broiled on a gridiron if
  the Government could do any such thing. It was of course only one of his
  characteristic idioms; which were at once homely and extravagant. He meant no
  more by this singular fireside fantasy than he would have meant by using the
  more familiar theological fantasy and saying he would see them damned first.
  Indeed, he would have looked forward to seeing the Ministers damned with a
  much more solemn and religious expectation. It only illustrates in passing a
  certain individual twist that lie could always give to his plain talk, that
  where another man would say 'I'll be hanged if you do,' or possibly 'I'll be
  shot if you do,' he had the fine fastidiousness to say 'I'll be broiled if
  you do.' But when his enemies began to shoot this light thing at him as an
  arrow from his own quiver, he wore it like a feather in his cap. He seized
  the opportunity of solidifying into an emblem something that had been but an
  idle word. They taunted him by turning his metaphor against him; and he
  answered them by turning their taunt against them. He hung up a huge gridiron
  outside his house; he brandished his gridiron in controversy like a club in a
  street riot. It seemed impossible to believe that any man could be wrong on a
  point that he pressed so provocatively; it was manifest that no man could be
  ashamed of an episode which he so paraded and perpetuated. And yet, in the
  actual episode itself, it is quite possible that he was quite wrong. A slight
  financial recovery of that sort was certainly not so insanely impossible as
  his metaphor implied; and as a matter of fact he was wrong in his general
  notion that immediate failure would follow the new financial experiments.
  Anyhow, he would probably have behaved in exactly the same way whatever had
  happened in the particular matter of which he originally spoke. It may be
  disputed whether this audacity should be classed as one of his vices or
  merely one of his talents. But certainly he had this talent, or if you will
  this trick, of turning defeat into victory. In this sense it is true to say
  that he had the tricks of a demagogue. Only, something more in the way of a
  definition of demagogy is needed before justice is done to him. But he did
  shout down his hecklers; and it was he on the hustings, much more than
  Johnson at the tea table, who knocked men down with the butt-end when his
  pistol missed fire. And he did have the power of making his very digressions
  and irrelevancies more important than other men's questions; the great
  gridiron did brand itself on men's memory when its origin was forgotten, and
  glowed through the twilight of time almost like the sacred gridiron of St.
  Lawrence.</p>

  <p>It was characteristic of Cobbett's instinct for the national sentiment,
  for a sort of sporting variety of chivalry very deep in his people, that he
  had thrown himself with refreshing fury against the opponents of Queen
  Caroline. It is also characteristic of his fighting spirit that he must have
  been rather more of a nuisance to her supporters than to her enemies. He
  bullied and browbeat the Queen's lawyers and advisers, he came near to
  bullying and browbeating the Queen; but in the main he respectfully confined
  himself to pestering and plaguing her. Yet his aim, as was often the case
  with him, was nonetheless sane because it was strenuous. It was his whole
  purpose to pin her to her full claims, and especially to nail her to her post
  in London, when there was any danger of her leaving the country; which might
  look like a surrender. So Dundee, a man of the fighting sort, had tried to
  nail James the Second, and prevent him seeming to abandon his claim with his
  country. Perhaps the feeling was the fiercer because Cobbett's old enemy
  Brougham was the lady's chief legal adviser; and nothing pleased Cobbett so
  much as to suggest that he was too legal to be loyal. Anyhow, there is no
  doubt that Cobbett was quite sincerely loyal. He enjoyed, indeed, not without
  an innocent vanity, his chivalric attitude as the champion of a woman; he had
  all his life a very honourable simplicity in his view of women. There are
  some very delightful touches in the letters of his daughter, who adored him,
  but who does not conceal her amusement at papa's new grandeur and
  gratification in his powdered hair and new court-suit and sword. There was no
  red waistcoat on these occasions.</p>

  <p>The affair of Caroline of Anspach need not be fully discussed here; though
  it is not without interest and certainly not without irony. The irony most
  relevant to her relations with the great demagogue is its suggestion of
  something not uncommon in democratic emotions. The mob has a curious way of
  being right by being wrong. It often champions the wrong person to punish the
  right person. It supports a true view by a false argument; or convicts a real
  criminal of an unreal crime. It may be doubted whether the official wife of
  George the Fourth deserved all the democratic devotion that was poured out
  for her; but there is little doubt that George the Fourth by this time
  deserved most of the democratic detestation that was hurled against him. Yet
  he had once been a far more generous and even a far more liberal man. And the
  sin that had rotted his honour was not his repudiation of his official wife
  Caroline, but his repudiation of his real wife Mrs. Fitzherbert. And it is
  the supreme irony of that strange story that his old and real crime rose from
  the grave against him, at the very moment when he was committing what was
  regarded as a more indefensible crime, but was really far more defensible.
  Lord Liverpool and the King's friends, goaded by the defiances of Cobbett and
  the mob, brought in a bill legally divorcing and degrading the Queen. The
  Queen's party retorted with a boldness that smacks very much of' Cobbett's
  controversial spirit; they threatened to bring up the King's first and secret
  marriage as an illegality forfeiting his whole position, because it was a
  marriage to a Catholic. At this point also, not for the first time, England
  and the great English agitator touched for a moment the hidden thing that had
  remained behind English history; at first a martyr and always a witness, and
  perhaps at last a deliverer.</p>

  <p>It is more difficult to make the people support the cause of the people
  than to make it support the cause of a person. Cobbett had not only the
  masses but most of the middle class with him about the dubious royal romance.
  He stood much more alone in dealing with the indubitable popular reality.
  That reality to which he testified with unwearied violence was something
  quite simple; yet it seemed to be too simple for the educated to understand.
  He shouted it in a, place more and more padded and cushioned with a
  comfortable optimism; and it had no echo. He shouted it in such a fashion
  that many of his hearers would have retorted that it was well that he should
  be in a padded cell. Yet what he shouted is of a certain curious interest and
  is worth recording. It might be typified very tersely in what he said in
  answer to one of the leading statesmen, who said that we might look with
  confidence to the future, 'because all the great interests are prospering.'
  Cobbett wrote in large letters like a man scrawling on a great wall or the
  side of a hill: 'The working classes, then, are not a great interest.'</p>

  <p>He added grimly that perhaps they might be some day. Those who see in
  Trade Union dictatorship a red dawn of revolutionary tyranny may pause upon
  the postscript: I am concerned to point out that this was, first and last,
  what he had to say: and he could not say it in the Reform Parliament. It is
  notable that a very fair sketch of Cobbett says that he did nothing in
  Parliament but make a crack-brained attack on Peel. Yet he can be judged even
  by what he attacked.</p>

  <p>That Cobbett should have attacked Peel, especially in Parliament, is
  exactly what any understanding person would have expected; I am tempted to
  say what any understanding person would have hoped. It was equally obvious
  that he would attack him in Parliament in very unparliamentary language. It
  is most obvious of all that his attack would be utterly unintelligible to all
  the Parliamentarians who can only speak the Parliamentary language and are
  unacquainted with the English language. Peel was a model Parliamentarian; in
  other words, he was a monument of everything that Cobbett detested and
  despised. Peel was a Tory without traditions; Peel was a Liberal without
  popular sympathies. Peel was Parliament, and could not be expected to have
  the faintest notion of what the people felt or experienced. The only truly
  popular tradition about Peel has nothing to do with the inscriptions on the
  statues or the speeches on the Corn Laws. It is the fact that, far down in
  the depths of a democratic world that politicians never visit, the slang
  names for the new police were 'Bobbies' or 'Peelers.' And if we want to seize
  the very soul of Peel and his Parliamentary type, we can fix it in the fact
  that he organised a tremendously powerful and privileged gendarmerie for the
  control or coercion of the people, and thought they could be distinguished
  from the guards of Continental despots by the fact that they wore top hats.
  That was the definition of Peelite citizenship: bribery in a top hat; tyranny
  in a top hat; anything so long as it was in a top hat. All that is really to
  be called British hypocrisy, all that can be fairly classed as English
  snobbery, all the vices that grew under cover of decorum, and of which the
  very vulgarities were shy-all that is truly expressed in the fact that men in
  those days were set to control mobs in top-hats, just as they played cricket
  in top-hats. It is no contradiction to this that the hat has since evolved
  into a helmet. It might have evolved into a complete suit of armour, so long
  as it evolved; evolution was the essence of that cautious and creeping
  philosophy. The point is that at the beginning the gendarme would not have
  been accepted if he had appeared in a cocked hat. It was a world, as Tennyson
  should have said, where tyranny slowly broadened down from precedent to
  precedent. The essential' thing of the epoch was the thin end of the wedge.
  It is needless to ask what Cobbett thought of the thin end of the wedge; he
  who always fought with the thick end of the cudgel. Nothing-not even his
  defence of Factory Acts with the scornful phrase that his England depended on
  yeomen, but the new Lancashire was apparently lost without little girls-was
  so typical as the fact that he opposed a Police Force.</p>

  <p>The short way of putting it is that Cobbett failed in Parliament. In a
  longer view it may be Parliament that failed. We can hardly say that the
  politicians failed to use the genius and energy of one of the greatest of
  Englishmen; for he was not a man to be used for any ends but his own, and
  they did not in the least desire to serve those ends. There was no possible
  point of contact, even for contradiction. It would be a very inadequate
  metaphor to say he was a fish out of water; for it was rather the politicians
  that were fishy. It would be truer to say that he was a very incautious diver
  drowning in a tank; but the truth is that he was simply a bull in a china
  shop. His sort of English, his sort of eloquence, his gesture, and his very
  bodily presence were not suitable in any case to senatorial deliberations.
  His was the sort of speaking that may make the welkin ring, but only makes
  the chairman ring a little bell. His attitude and action had about them the
  great spaces of the downs or the sweeping countrysides; the lifting of the
  great clouds and the silent upheaval of the hills. His warnings and rebukes
  sounded more homely and natural when they were shouted, as a man might shout
  across a meadow a rebuke to a trespasser or a warning against a bull. But
  that sort of shouting when it is shut up in a close and heated room has the
  appearance of madness. The company received the impression of a mere maniac.
  Yet there was not a man in that room who had a clearer head or a clearer
  style, or a better basis of common sense. And he showed easily enough in his
  English Grammar that it was really he who could reason and his critics who
  could only rant.</p>

  <p>Indeed, a change was passing over England which he was already too old to
  understand; under the double rule of so patrician a Liberal as Melbourne and
  so bourgeois a Tory as Peel. An atmosphere was being generated not exactly
  like anything that had ever existed or perhaps will ever exist again; in
  which the jests of Canning would have been quite as inappropriate as the
  curses of Cobbett. It was not exactly a creed or a cause, or even a spirit;
  the nearest description is to say that it was a silence. All its undertakings
  were understandings; all its laws were unwritten laws. There was a silent
  understanding in the new middle class that it would not really rebel against
  the aristocracy. There was a silent understanding in the aristocracy that it
  would not really resist the invasion of the middle class. There was a silent
  alliance between the two that neither would really think about that third
  thing which moved in the depths; visible for an instant in burning hayricks
  and broken machines. It was an understanding that produced its own courtesy
  and culture, its own poets and painters, its own patriotism and historic
  pride; so that we who were born in the last days of that tradition can never
  treat it altogether without piety and gratitude. The atmosphere had then no
  name; but a few years afterwards there was found for it a name and a figure
  and a national symbol; when a girl stood crowned before the altar at
  Westminster. We call it the Victorian Age.</p>

  <p>It is not very likely that many members of Parliament noticed a little
  before this time that a seat in the House of Commons was empty. To a much
  greater extent than the profane vulgar are aware, the House of Commons often
  largely consists of empty seats. On important occasions, when there was more
  of a bustle and a crowd, the gap might be even less noticeable; there were so
  many serious things to hold the attention. There was the question of whether
  one Graham with the assistance of another Graham, his brother, could or could
  not have formed a Ministry that would include a gentleman named Grey. There
  was the question of whether somebody known as Lord Althorpe would soon be
  turned into somebody else called Earl Spencer, Under the strain of pressing
  problems of this kind, the Commons were not likely, to trouble about the more
  and more frequent and eventually prolonged absence of one member or even of
  one vote; for indeed the vote had been as erratic as the member. His name was
  down in the lists among that queer and laughable little minority that had
  voted against the New Poor Law; along with Dan O'Connell and such odd
  creatures. Lately he had not been seen about at all. Probably nobody knew
  that in the last few days William Cobbett had gone back to his farm and
  died.</p>

  <p>Far away on those great windy and grassy heights where he had gone crow
  scaring as a child, his funeral procession trailed as black and meagre as a
  string of crows. They buried him in the little churchyard at Farnham; and he
  had died on the farm not far off that lay on the hillside looking across to
  the hill-town of Guildford: a place of steep streets and a crown of roofs and
  spires which, seen from a distance, seems not unworthy of its noble medieval
  name. He had a happy death, who in the last achievement of his ambition had
  had an unhappy life. For he was suffered to die, after all his wanderings,
  among those he loved, and in the privacy which he loved to be the cover of
  such love, with all his appetite for a loud publicity in other things.
  Considering what a name he left, the privacy might have been called neglect;
  but in that sense, and especially in that mood, he would certainly have
  preferred to be to that extent neglected. Only his family and a few friends
  appear as recognisable figures in the landscape of his funeral; but as they
  carried, the coffin through meadow and churchyard, there followed it one
  lonely figure that would have been conspicuous in any landscape; a man of
  giant stature, clad in black and with a white glove on his right hand:
  O'Connell.</p>

  <p>It seems to have been the general impression of his contemporaries that
  he, who had survived hard riding and the sea and prison and the American
  summer, was eventually killed by the House of Commons. Chatham had carried
  his dramatic talent almost to the point of dying in the House of Lords. But
  certainly Westminster was the very last place where Cobbett would have wished
  to die&mdash;or for that matter to live. He had no such power of illusion as
had
  enabled the great Imperialist to live and die in a passion of patriotic
  play-acting. Indeed, Cobbett had no power of illusion at all; that is why he
  was not what people call a practical man. That was especially why he could
  never manage to be a Whig; however much he might be called a Tory or a
  Radical. He could never have understood the sincerity there was in the
  self-deception of a man like Burke, who could look back on the oligarchical
  intrigues of 1688 and onwards in a glow of Constitutional enthusiasm. Perhaps
  to say that he was never a Whig is but another way of saying that he was not
  an aristocrat. History was not a hobby; politics were not a game, even a game
  played for money. He had that indefinable attitude which marks the man who
  has always had to earn his own living. He wanted history and polities to be
  useful; in that sense he was quite utilitarian. In the strict sense of the
  word, he was not a gentleman&mdash;he was a yeoman. He was a farmer who
worked for
  a harvest; not a landscape painter or even a landscape gardener. All his wild
  life long he was working for a harvest; even when men thought he was sowing
  the wild oats of fanaticism; even when they thought he was sowing the
  dragon's teeth of revolution. He was trying to get results; and did not mind
  how hard he worked to get them. He worked to get a reform of Parliament; he
  worked to get a more popular control of Parliament; not because he
  particularly wanted to see the working of a new constitution in the abstract,
  but because he thought the old constitution was delaying the harvest. He
  worked for a right to take a hand in the work. He worked for a place among
  the new rulers of a new realm. He worked for a seat at Westminster because he
  really believed, more or less, that it would be a sort of throne from which
  he would see all England rejoicing in the new liberty; since the hirelings
  and hacks of the wicked squires were gone and there had been summoned, in the
  ancient language of English liberty, a Free Parliament. The height from which
  he would look over that landscape of liberty would be higher than the
  Accursed Hill. He would see a New Sarum almost as ideal as the New Jerusalem,
  if not descending out of heaven from God, at least lifted towards heaven by
  the giant limbs of liberated man; by the proud toil and spontaneous prudence
  of the free. The new Parliament was meant to make a new people. And almost
  the first thing it did was to pass the New Poor Law. Almost the first thing
  it did was to hand over little Oliver Twist to be starved and beaten by
  Bumble and Claypole: and sell English children into slavery for being
  poor.</p>

  <p>There is an irony that is like an agony and is beyond speech or measure.
  It were vain to wonder, in the normal way, what manner of words would have
  come to those all too tempestuous lips; what lucid violence of logic as of
  light through rending rocks would have tried to do justice to that towering
  contradiction, in the days when the giant was young. Much he did say, of
  course, in his own way. But there was something in that final contradiction
  that could not so be contradicted finally or fully: and when Cobbett came
  with the clearer eyes of later life to look at the Reform Parliament, to look
  steadily at its Reformers and its Parliamentarians, to absorb the whole scene
  of how such laws are made and how such men make them; to sit in his seat in
  silence for a little, and take in all that enormous thing calmly and
  completely&mdash;then he made the only comment at all commensurate with it, or
  equal in eloquence to the occasion: he died.</p>

  <p>The great world with its wheels of progress that went rolling over him did
  not understand his death any more than his life. A hundred years afterwards
  he is perhaps better known than he was ten years afterwards, or even ten
  minutes afterwards. Two hundred years afterwards, perhaps, he will be known
  better still. Johnson is more human and familiar to every casual reader today
  than he was to Churchill or Horace Walpole; but Johnson had a bodyguard of
  faithful friends who really understood him, his quaint weaknesses and his
  mighty worth. Cobbett hardly had a friend outside his family; and it is
  doubtful whether there had ever been one human being who really understood
  what he meant. His political allies were not friend; and they were not
  generally for very long allies. And the reason was that not one of them could
  enlarge his mind to understand the mind of Cobbett; or that immense desire
  for the deliverance and perpetuation of the whole huge humanity of England.
  The makers of the French Pantheon, wisely combining republican and royal and
  imperial trophies, have inscribed their common monument, 'To All the Glories
  of France.' If any man as wise had stood by the little gravestone in the
  churchyard of Farnham, he might have traced the words, 'To All the Glories of
  England.' All the other leaders were falling apart into foolish party systems
  and false antitheses; into Tories who were mere squires, and Radicals who
  were mere merchants. Windham had been his friend; but who could expect
  Windham to understand what he felt about the wild justice of the Luddite
  fires? Orator Hunt had been his ally; but who could expect Hunt to know what
  Cobbett was talking about when he praised the spires of the Gothic churches
  or the saints of the Dark Ages? This uneducated man was too well educated for
  all his contemporaries. He stood in a world which believed that it was
  broadening; and the whole mind of that world was narrower than his own. It
  believed itself to be growing modern and many-sided; and he alone saw that it
  was growing monomaniac and mean. And that larger vision died with him: and
  vanished for a hundred years.</p>

  <p>Cobbett was only too ready to give people, in the language of the comic
  landlady, a piece of his mind. But the accidental phrase is after all an
  accurate phrase. It was only a piece of his mind that was ever given to
  anybody; a rather ragged piece often torn off in a rather random fashion: but
  not the whole truth that he really meant, for that he had great difficulty in
  giving to anybody, perhaps even to himself. Talkative as he was, it may be
  that he never said enough; and lucid as he was, it may be that he never quite
  got to the point. But the point was a whole point of view. And whether it was
  his fault or the other people's fault, that point of view was never really
  taken by anybody else: nobody stood exactly where he stood or saw the world
  exactly as he saw it; or others would have realised that, amid all his
  contradictory phrases and combative passions, he did in a real sense of his
  own see life steadily and see it whole. As we look back on his life, even the
  views that were not consistent with each other seem to be consistent with
  him. A friend would not deny that he contradicted himself; but a friend would
  be able to guess when and where he would probably contradict himself. Only in
  this sense it is true to say that he never had a friend. He had affections,
  and he had alliances; but not one true intellectual friendship.</p>

  <p>There was this true distinction in the mind of the self-taught farmer:
  that his mind is a place where extremes meet. When it can be said of a man
  that the Tories thought him a Radical, and the Radicals thought him a Tory,
  the first thing that will occur to us is that he is a moderate. It can truly
  be said of Cobbett; and the very last thing that would occur to anybody would
  be to call him a moderate. He was not only the reverse of a moderate, he was
  something that would be utterly bewildering to any moderate. He was an
  extremist all round. He was more Tory than most Tories, and more Radical than
  most Radicals. In other words, it was because he was original; but it was
  also because he was universal. He did not altogether understand his own
  universality; and he expressed it mostly in the form of inconsistency. He was
  fanatical, but he was not narrow. With all his fanaticism, he was really
  looking at things from too many points of view at once to be understood by
  those who wore the blinkers of a party or even a theory. He seemed to be at
  all extremes, because he had in some sense encircled and surrounded his whole
  generation. Ignorant and violent as he seemed on the surface, his spirit was
  like one that had lived before and after. He was there before they were all
  born, in the crowded medieval churches. He was there after they were all
  dead, in the crowded congresses of the Trades Unions. It was not knowledge,
  but it was understanding, in the sense of sympathy. When we find this sort of
  universality we find, I think, a thing on the heroic scale. It would surely
  be no bad definition of greatness in a man, to say that we can strike out in
  any direction and still find the circumference of his mind.</p>

  <p>There was never a Cobbettite except Cobbett. That gives him an absolute
  quality not without a sort of authority. He was a full man and a ready man,
  but he was not an exact man. He was not a scientific man or in the orderly
  and conscious sense even a philosophical man. But he was, by this rather
  determining test, a great man. He was large enough to be lonely. He had more
  inside him than he could easily find satisfied outside him. He meant more by
  what he said even than the other men who said it. He was one of the rare men
  to whom the truisms are truths. This union of different things in his
  thoughts was not sufficiently thought out; but it was a union. It was not a
  compromise; it was a man. That is what is meant by saying that it was also a
  great man. There was something in him that the world had not taught him; even
  if it was too vast and vague for him to teach it to the world. Things were
  part of that thing that could not be parts of any other thing. That is why he
  had no real intellectual friendships among the intellectuals of his day, when
  all allowance is made for his real faults of vanity and violence and
  readiness to quarrel. It is easy to argue about how he came to quarrel with
  his best friends. It is more penetrating to ask how he could ever come to
  agree with them. Even to the best of them his whole outlook, which seemed to
  him so simple, would have been bewildering. How was Orator Hunt to understand
  that the great empty churches with their gaping mouths cried aloud that they
  also belonged to the future, because they belonged to the past? How was the
  Right Honourable William Windham to understand that riotous artisans in the
  Black Country were also appealing to the past, as well as threatening the
  future? How was Mr. Carlile the atheist bookseller to know that a ruined
  abbey and a raging mob were one thing; and that thing liberty? How was Lord
  Brougham to understand that a field of clover and a grotesque gridiron were
  one thing; and that thing England?</p>

  <p>That is the paradox of Cobbett; that in a sense he quarrelled with
  everybody because he reconciled everything. From him, at least, so many men
  were divided, because in him so many things were unified. He appeared
  inconsistent enough in the thousand things that he reviled; but he would have
  appeared far more inconsistent in the things that he accepted. The breadth of
  his sympathy would have been stranger than all his antipathies; and his peace
  was more provocative than war. Therefore it is that our last impression of
  him is of a loneliness not wholly due to his hatreds, but partly also to his
  loves. For the desires of his intellect and imagination never met anything
  but thwarting and wounding in this world; and though the ordinary part of him
  was often happy enough, the superior part was never satisfied. He never came
  quite near enough to a religion that might have satisfied him. But with
  philosophies he would never have been satisfied, especially the mean and
  meagre philosophies of his day. The cause he felt within him was too mighty
  and multiform to have been fed with anything less than the Faith. Therefore
  it was that when he lay dying in his farmhouse on the hills, those he had
  loved best in his simple fashion were near to his heart; but of all the
  millions of the outer world there was none near to his mind, and all that he
  meant escaped and went its way, like a great wind that roars over the rolling
  downs.</p>

  <p>This book began with an indefensible piece of personal recollection, and I
  fear it will have to end with another. Perhaps I might plead the influence of
  the man I have been studying and trying to understand; who has been called
  egotistical, though I should be content to call him autobiographical. As Mr.
  Cole pointed out in his admirable biography, Cobbett treated his ego as an
  emblematic figure of England, as Whitman did his of America. My own memories
  can have no such symbolic excuse; but I passed much of my childhood along
  that main thoroughfare where Cobbett had his seed farm at Kensington; and one
  of the last things my own fattier told me was a tale of a strange object
  hanging above the road, before alterations and destructions removed it; one
  glimpse of a symbolic shape more ugly and ungainly than a gallows in the
  sunlight: the Gridiron.</p>

  <p>All that he hated has triumphed on that spot. The ordinary shop that he
  thought a nuisance has swelled into the big emporium he would have thought a
  nightmare; the suburb has sunk deep into the new London; but the road still
  runs westward down which he went riding so often, heading for the open
  country, and leaving the Wen as far as possible behind. The Wen has pursued
  him, shooting out further and further in telescopic perspective, past
  Hammersmith and Chiswick and Richmond; and still I seem to see the back of
  that vanishing rider ever ahead, and lessening amid changing scenery; hills
  turning about him like a transformation scene, away almost to the stormy wall
  of Wales. It was as if he were riding further and further westward, following
  towards the sunset the road of the fallen kings; where a low red light glows
  for ever upon things forgotten and the last ruins of the Round Table. And yet
  I am not sure of such a view of history; it seems to me that with us also
  things change and even change places; and the war does not always go one way.
  When I used to go out as a boy into the green twilight, having written
  nonsense all night (fortunately unpublished), and drink coffee at a stall in
  the street, brooding upon all these things, it seemed then as if the tide
  were running high enough in the one direction; but I have since had a notion
  that high tides can turn. The enormous buildings, seen in outline like
  uncouth drawings, seem to stand up more insecurely against an altered sky;
  with some change in it too subtle yet to be called the twilight. I
  discovered, at least, that even in all that labyrinth of the new London by
  night there is an unvisited hour of almost utter stillness, before the
  creaking carts begin to come in from the market-gardens, to remind us that
  there is still somewhere a countryside. And in that stillness I have
  sometimes fancied I heard, tiny and infinitely far away, something like a
  faint voice hallooing and the sound of horse-hoofs that return.</p>
