<h2><a id="prologue"></a>PROLOGUE.</h2>

<p class="first">THE heat in the <i>silo</i> was terrific, and
the atmosphere terrible.</p>

<p>A whimsical remark from the man they called Jacob the
Jew, to the effect that he wondered whether this were heat
made black, or blackness made hot, remained unanswered for
some minutes, until a quiet voice observed in good French,
but with an English accent:</p>

<p>"It is the new heat, Jacob. Red hot and white hot, we
know. We are now black hot.... And when I have to leave
this quiet retreat I shall take a chunk of the atmosphere
... a souvenir ... keep it in my haversack."</p>

<p>The man spoke as one who talks against time&mdash;the
time when sanity or strength shall have departed.</p>

<p>"Good idea," mused another voice with a similar accent.
"Send a bit to one's National Museum, too.... You an
Englishman?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the other. "Are you?"</p>

<p>"No ... American," was the reply.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Silence.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>The clank of irons and a deep groan.</p>

<p>"Oh, God," moaned the wounded Spaniard, "do not let me
die in the grave.... Oh, Mother of God, intercede for me.
Let me die above ground."</p>

<p>"You are not going to die, Ramon," said the
Englishman.</p>

<p>"No indeed," observed Jacob the Jew. "Certainly not,
good Ramon. No gentleman would die here and now.... You
would incommode us enormously, Ramon.... I go the length
of stating that I absolutely do prefer you alive&mdash;and
that's the first time you've heard <i>that</i>, Ramon.... Worth
being put in a <i>silo</i> for."</p>

<p>"That's enough, Jacob," said the Englishman; "hold your
tongue."</p>

<p>The irons clanked again, as though the sick man turned
in the direction of the last speaker.</p>

<p>"You'll keep your promise, Señor Caballero?" moaned the
dying man. "You <i>have</i> forgiven me?... Truly?... You'll
keep your promise?... And the Mother of God will come
Herself and tend your death-bed.... If you don't, my dying
curse shall blast ..."</p>

<p>"I'll see to it, Ramon," said the Englishman quietly.
"Don't bother about cursing and blasting...."</p>

<p>"You'll see that I die kneeling!... You won't let me
die until I kneel up?... You'll hold my hands together in
prayer ... my head low bowed upon my breast?... And then
you'll lay me flat and cross my hands and make the Sign of
the Cross upon my forehead...."</p>

<p>"As I promised, Ramon."</p>

<p>"You'll let God <i>see</i> that I fear Him.... <i>He wouldn't
mistake me for my brother?</i>... He wouldn't visit my
brother's sins on <i>me</i>?"</p>

<p>"God is just," said the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Yes, my poor Ramon," observed Jacob the Jew, "I greatly
fear that you'll find God just.... But don't say that you
have a brother, Ramon?"</p>

<p>"<i>Nombre de Dios</i>, but I have, <i>hombre</i>!..." gabbled the Spaniard. "And he is in Hell ... <i>Seguramente</i>.... He was
an enemy of God.... He hated God.... He defied God.... And
God took him and broke him.... <i>Caramba!</i> It is not fair
the way God ... <i>Yes</i>.... <i>Yes</i>.... <i>Yes</i>.... It <i>is</i> fair, and God is good, kind, loving and&mdash;er&mdash;just."</p>

<p>"Yes. <i>Just</i>&mdash;Ramon," said Jacob.</p>

<p>"If I could find your nose, my friend," said the
American, turning in the direction of the last speaker, "I
would certainly pull it."</p>

<p>"I will strike a match for you later," replied Jacob,
a man famous among the brave for his courage; brilliantly
clever, bitterly cynical, and endowed with a twofold
portion of the mental, moral and physical endurance of his
enduring race.</p>

<p>"God will not punish me for my brother's sins, will He,
Señor Smith?" continued the Spaniard.</p>

<p>"No," replied the Englishman, "nor him for his own."</p>

<p>"Meaning him, or Him?" inquired Jacob softly.</p>

<p>"We punish ourselves, I think," continued the
Englishman, "<i>quite</i> sufficiently."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" said a cultured French voice, "but you are
only partly right, <i>mon ami</i>. Woman punishes Man, or we
punish ourselves&mdash;through Woman."</p>

<p>"Bless ourselves, you mean," said the Englishman and the
American immediately and simultaneously.</p>

<p>"The same thing," replied the Frenchman. And the utter
stillness that followed was broken by a little gasping sigh
that seemed to shape a name&mdash;"<i>Véronique</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Basta!... My brother!... My brother!</i>..." babbled the
Spaniard and sobbed, "God will distinguish between us....
<i>Gracias a nuestra Madre en el cielo! Gracias a la Virgen
Inmaculada.... Un millón de gracias.</i>..."</p>

<p>"And what of this accursed brother? Surely no brother of
<i>yours</i> committed an interesting sin?" inquired Jacob.</p>

<p>"<i>Cá!</i> It was the priest's fault," continued the
Spaniard, unheeding. "We were good enough boys.... Only
mischievous.... Fonder perhaps of the girls and the
sunshine and the wine-skin and the bull-ring than of
religion and work.... My brother <i>was</i> a good boy, none
better from Pampeluna to Malaga&mdash;if a little quick
with his knife and over-well acquainted with the smuggler
track&mdash;until that accursed and hell-doomed priest
... No! No! No!... I mean that good and holy man of
God&mdash;cast his eye upon Dolores....</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother of God! <i>He killed a priest....</i> And he
defied and challenged God.... And I am his twin brother!...
God may mistake me for him."</p>

<p>"God makes no mistakes, Ramon," said the Englishman.
"Excuse my playing the oracle and Heavy Father,
but&mdash;er&mdash;you can be quite sure of that, my
lad."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes&mdash;you're right. Of course you are
right! How should God make mistakes?... Besides, God knows
my brother, <i>well</i>. He followed him.... He warned him....
When he swore he would never enter a church again, God
flung him into one.... When he swore he would never kneel
again, God struck him to his knees and held him there....
Because he swore that he would never make the Sign of the
Cross, God made a Sign of the Cross, <i>of</i> him."</p>

<p>"Quite noticed the little man, in fact," observed Jacob
the Jew. "Tell us."</p>

<p>"My brother caught the priest and Dolores.... In the
priest's own church.... My brother married them before
the altar ... and their married life was brief!... But of
course, God knew he was mad.... As he left that desecrated
church, he cried, '<i>Never will I enter the House of God,
again!...</i>'</p>

<p>"And that very night the big earthquake came and
shattered our village with a dozen others. As we dashed
through the door&mdash;the old mother in my brother's
arms, my crippled sister on my back&mdash;the roof caved
in and the very road fell from before our little <i>posada</i>,
down the hillside. My brother was in front and fell, my
mother still in his arms.... And where did he recover
consciousness? Tell me that!... <i>Before the altar</i>, upon
the dead body of his victim, the murdered priest&mdash;who
thus saved my brother's life, for he had fallen thirty
feet from the half-destroyed church-roof, through which he
had crashed.... Yes, he had entered the House of God once
more!...</p>

<p>"It was to South America that he fled from the
police&mdash;to that El Dorado where so many of us go
in search of what we never find. And there he went from
worse to worse than worst, defying God and slaying man
... and woman! For he shot his own woman merely because
she knelt&mdash;just went on her knees to God.... And
one terrible night of awful storm, when fleeing alone by
mountain paths from the soldiers or <i>guardias civiles</i>, a
flash of lightning showed him a ruined building, and into
it he dashed and hid.</p>

<p>"It may have been the rolling thunder, the streaming
rain, or an avalanche of stones dislodged by the horses of
the police who passed along the path above&mdash;I do not
know&mdash;but there was a terrible crash, a heavy blow,
a blinding, suffocating dust&mdash;and he was pinned,
trapped, held as in a giant fist, unable to move hand or
foot, or head....</p>

<p>"And, when daylight came, he saw that he was in a
ruined chapel of the old <i>conquistadores</i>, kneeling before
the altar&mdash;a beam across his bowed shoulders and
neck; a beam across his legs behind his knees; a mass of
stone and rubble as high as his waist.... And there my
brother <i>knelt</i>&mdash;before the altar of God&mdash;in
that attitude of prayer which he had sworn never to
assume&mdash;and thought his thoughts.... For a night and
a day and a night, he knelt, his stiff neck bent, but his
brave heart unsoftened.... And thus the soldiers found him
and took him to the <i>calabozo</i>....</p>

<p>"The annual revolution occurred on the eve of his
garroting, and he was saved. Having to flee the country,
he returned to Spain, and sought me out.... Owing to a
little smuggling trouble, in which a <i>guardia civil</i> lost
his life, we crossed into France, and, in order to get to
Africa and start afresh, we joined the Legion....</p>

<p>"<i>Válgame Dios!</i> In the Legion we made quite a little
name for ourselves&mdash;not so easy a thing to do in the
Legion, as some of you may know. There they fear nothing.
They fear no thing, but God is not a thing, my friends.
<i>Diantre!</i> They fear neither man nor devil, neither death
nor danger&mdash;but they fear God.... Most of them....
When they come to die, anyhow.</p>

<p>"But my brother did not fear God.... And his <i>escouade</i>
of devils realized that he was braver than they ... braver
by that much.... And always he blasphemed. Always he
defied, insulted, challenged God. He had a terrible fight
with Luniowski the Atheist, and Luniowski lost an eye in
the defence of his No-God. My brother fought with awful
ferocity in defence of his God&mdash;the God he <i>must</i>
have, that he might hate and revile Him&mdash;the God Who
had sat calmly in His Heaven and watched Dolores and the
priest....</p>

<p>"In Africa there was little fear of his finding himself
flung into a church, or pinned on his knees before a
chapel altar! We aren't much troubled with chaplains and
church-parades in the Legion!</p>

<p>"But one day my brother saw a lad, a boy from Provence,
a chubby-faced child, make the Sign of the Cross upon his
breast, as we were preparing to die of thirst, lost in a
desert sand-storm.... My brother, with all his remaining
strength, struck him upon the mouth.</p>

<p>"'<i>Sangre de Cristo!</i> If I see you make that
Sign again,' he croaked, 'I'll do it on you with a
bayonet.'...</p>

<p>"'If we come through this, I <i>will</i> make the Sign of the
Cross on you with a bayonet,' gasped the boy hoarsely, and
my brother laughed.</p>

<p>"'Try,' said he. 'Try when I'm asleep. Try when I'm
dying.... Try when I'm dead.... Do you not know that I am a
<i>devil</i>? Why, your bayonet would melt.... <i>Me!</i> The Sign of
the Cross!... <i>God Himself could not do it!</i>'</p>

<p>"And next day my brother was lost in that sand-storm,
and the Touareg band who found him, took him to the Sultan
of Zeggat.... And the Sultan of Zeggat <i>crucified</i> him in
the market-place, 'as the appropriate death for a good
Christian!'... Wasn't that humorous!..."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Silence.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"Yes, God made a Sign <i>of</i> my brother," said Ramon the
Spaniard, and added, "Help me to my knees, Señor Smith, and
keep each word of your promise, for I think I am dying."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Silence....</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>And then a cry of "<i>Dios aparece</i>" from the dying
man.</p>

<p>Jacob the Jew, great adept at concealment, produced
matches and struck one.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>The flare of the match illumined a deep-dug pit, its
floor hard-beaten, its walls sloping to a small aperture,
through which a star was visible. It had been dug and
shaped, for the storing of grain, by Arabs following a
custom and a pattern which were old in the days when
Carthage was young.</p>

<p>It was now stored, not with grain, but with men*
sentenced to punishment beyond punishment, men of the
Disciplinary Battalions, the <i>Compagnies de Discipline</i>,
the "<i>Joyeux,</i>" the "<i>Zephyrs</i>," the <i>Bataillion
d'Infanterie Légère d'Afrique</i>&mdash;convicted criminals.</p>

<p class="footnote">* A prohibited and illegal form of punishment.</p>

<p> The light from the burning match revealed a picture
worthy of the pencil of the illustrator of Dante's
<i>Inferno</i>&mdash;a small group of filthy, unshorn, emaciated
men, clad in ragged brown canvas uniforms which, with the
grime upon their flesh, gave them the appearance of being
already part of the earth to which they were about to
return, portions of the living grave in which they were
entombed.</p>

<p>Some lay motionless as though already dead. One or two
sat huddled, their heads upon their clasped knees, the
inward-sloping sides of the <i>silo</i> denying them even the
poor comfort of a wall against which to lean.</p>

<p>Beside a large jug which held a little water, a man lay
upon his face, his tongue thrust into the still-damp earth
where a few drops of water had been spilt. He had drunk his
allowance on the previous day.</p>

<p>Another looked up from his blind search, with sensitive
finger-tips, for grains of corn among the dirt.</p>

<p>As Jacob held the match aloft, the Englishman and the
American gently raised the body of Ramon the Spaniard from
the ground. It was but a body, for the soul had fled.</p>

<p>"Too late," said Jacob softly. "But perhaps <i>le bon
Dieu</i> will let him off with eight days' <i>salle de police</i>
in Hell, as it wasn't his fault that he did not assume the
correct drill-position for dying respectfully....</p>

<p>"No use heaving him up now," he added, as the head
rolled loosely forward.</p>

<p>Without reply, the Englishman and American lifted the
dead man to his knees, and reverently did all that had been
promised.</p>

<p>And when the body was disposed as Ramon had desired,
Jacob spoke again.</p>

<p>"There are but five matches," he said, "but Ramon shall
have two, as candles at his head and feet. It would please
the poor Ramon."</p>

<p>"You're a good fellow, Jacob," said the Englishman, "...
if you'll excuse the insult."</p>

<p>Jacob struck two matches, and the Englishman and the
American each taking one, held it, the one at the head, the
other at the feet, of the dead man.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned to behold this strange and brief
lying-in-state of the Spanish smuggler, court-martialled
from the Legion to the Zephyrs.</p>

<p>"Pray for the soul of Ramon Gonzales, who died in the
fear of God&mdash;or, at any rate, in the fear of what God
might do to him," said Jacob the Jew.</p>

<p>The Frenchman who had observed that Man's punishment was
Woman, painfully dragged himself into a sitting posture and
crawled toward the body.</p>

<p>"I have conducted military funerals," said he, "and
remember something of the drill and book-of-the-words."</p>

<p>But what he remembered was not available, for, after the
recital of a few lines of the burial-service, he fainted
and collapsed.</p>

<p>"This is a very nice funeral," said Jacob the Jew, "but
what about the burial?" </p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p> Suddenly a man leapt to his feet and, screaming
insanely, beat the wall with his manacled hands.</p>

<p>"Come! Come! Smolensky" soothed the huge grey-haired
Russian who had been Prince Berchinsky. "We mustn't lose
our heads, comrade.... I nearly lost mine once.... Sit
down.... I'll tell you about it.... Hush now!... Hush!
And listen.... Yes ... I nearly lost my head once. It was
offered as a prize! Think of that! There's an honour for
you!</p>

<p>"It was like this.... I was with Dodds' lot at
Dahomey, you know. He was almost a nigger himself, but
he was a soldier all-right, believe me. Faraux was our
Battalion-Commander and General Dodds thought a lot of
him&mdash;and of us. It quite upset Dodds when Faraux was
killed at the battle of G'bede, but he kept the Legion in
front all the same.... So much in front that he lost me,
<i>le Légionnaire</i> Badineff....</p>

<p>"I was with a small advance-guard and we were literally
pushing our way through that awful jungle when the Amazons
ambushed us.... Wonderful women those Amazons&mdash;far
better fighters than the men&mdash;braver, stronger,
cleverer, more soldierly.... Armed with short American
carbines and <i>coupe-coupes</i>, they're no joke!</p>

<p>"I don't want to fight any better troops.... Not what
you'd call good shots, but as they never make the range
more than about twenty yards, they don't miss much!...</p>

<p>"Well, it wasn't many minutes before I was the only man
of the advance-guard who was on his feet, and I wasn't
on those long.... For these she-devils were absolutely
all round us, and as three or four rushed me with their
<i>machetes</i>, one of them smashed me on the head, from
behind, with the butt of her carbine.... Quite a useful
bump too, <i>mes amis</i> ... for it put me to sleep for quite a
while...."</p>

<p>"Lost your head, in fact," put in Jacob the Jew.</p>

<p>"No, no," continued the old Russian, "not yet ... but I
nearly lost my wits when I recovered my senses ... if you
understand me.... For the ladies had divided my property
among them to the last rag of my shirt, and were now
evidently turning to pleasure after business.</p>

<p>"Dahomeyan is not one of the languages which I speak....
I only know fourteen really well ... so I could not follow
the discussion closely.... But it was quite clear that
some were for fire and some for steel.... I think a small
minority-party were for cord.... And I was under the
impression that one merry lass capped the others' laughing
suggestions with the proposal for all three!...</p>

<p>"Do you know, it was for all the world like a lot of
nice little girls sitting on the lawn under the trees with
their kitten, joyously discussing how they should dress him
up, and which ribbons they should put round his neck....</p>

<p>"You know how they laugh and chatter and pull the
kitten about, and each one shouts a fresh idea about the
dressing-up and the ribbons, and the fun generally....
Well, those nice little girls discussed dressing
me&mdash;for the table&mdash;though it wasn't a ribbon they
proposed putting round my neck.... And undeniably they
pulled me about!...</p>

<p>"I could not but admire the way they had tied me
up.... I was more like a chrysalis in a cocoon than a
bound man.... They <i>were</i> playful.... Good actresses
too&mdash;as I realized afterwards.... When they saw that
I had come round, one of them, eyeing me archly, drew her
finger across her throat, and the others all nodded their
approval.</p>

<p>"The young thing got up, took a bright sharp knife from
her waist-belt, and came over to where I lay against the
bole of a tree.</p>

<p>"Grabbing my throat with her left hand, she pulled up
the loose skin and began to cut, just as the Leading Lady
called out some fresh stage-directions&mdash;whereupon she
grabbed my beard, pulled my head over to one side, and put
the point of the knife in, just below my ear.... I closed
my eyes and tried to think of a prayer....</p>

<p>"When it comes to it, having your throat cut is the
nastiest death there is....</p>

<p>"And just as I was either going to pray or yell, there
was a loud burst of laughter, and the girl went back to her
place in the jolly group.... The Leading Lady then, as far
as I could make out, said:</p>

<p>"'Now we must really get to business or the shops will
be shut' ... and told another lassie, who possessed a good
useful iron-hafted spear, to put the butt-end of it in the
fire, explaining why, with appropriate gesture....</p>

<p>"It was evidently quite a good idea, for the girls all
laughed and clapped their hands, and said what a nice party
it was....</p>

<p>"While the spear was getting hot, they propounded all
sorts of other lovely ideas, and, over the specially choice
ones, they simply rocked with merriment.... It <i>did</i> seem
a pity that one couldn't follow all the jokes.... When the
pointed haft of the spear was glowing nicely, its owner
picked it up, and stepping daintily across to me, held the
point a few inches from my eyes....</p>

<p>"Not unnaturally, I turned my head away, but, saying
that that wasn't fair, the Leading Lady and the Soubrette
made one jump for me and grabbed my head....</p>

<p>"Fine strong hands and arms those ladies had.... I
couldn't move my face a fraction of an inch....</p>

<p>"And slowly ... slowly ... slowly ... that red-hot point
came nearer and nearer to my right eye.... It seemed to
approach for hours, and it seemed to be in the centre of my
brain in a second....</p>

<p>"When it comes to it, <i>mes amis</i>, having your eyes burnt
out with a red-hot spear-haft is the nastiest death there
is....</p>

<p>"But when my right eye seemed to sizzle and boil behind
its closed lid, and to be about to burst, my young friend
changed her mind, and began upon the left ... and when the
iron was just about to touch it she remarked, in choice
Dahomeyan, I believe:</p>

<p>"'Dammit! The blooming iron's cold!' and, with a
joyous whoop, bounded back to the fire, and thrust it in
again....</p>

<p>"Shrieks of laughter followed, and loud applause from
the cheap seats.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile the ladies hanged me...."</p>

<p>"<i>Hanged</i> you?" inquired Jacob the Jew. "Don't you mean
they cut your head off?... You said you lost your head, you
remember."</p>

<p>"No, my friend," replied Badineff, "I said I <i>nearly</i>
lost it.... Not completely&mdash;as you have lost your
manners.... What I am telling you is true.... And if you
don't like it, pray go elsewhere...."</p>

<p>"There's nowhere to go but Heaven, I'm afraid," was the
reply ... "being in Hell&mdash;and Earth being denied to
us.... But pray finish your story, as it is unlikely we
shall meet in Heaven...."</p>

<p>"Yes.... They hanged me as neatly and as expeditiously
as if they had had the advantage of an education in
Christian customs.... They simply jerked me to my feet,
made a noose in a palm-fibre cord, threw the end over the
limb of a vast tree, hauled upon it and danced around me as
I hung and twisted....</p>

<p>"They say a coward dies many times.... That was
undoubtedly one of the occasions upon which I have
died....</p>

<p>"When it comes to it, <i>mes amis</i>, being hanged by
strangulation&mdash;and not by mere neck-break&mdash;is one
of the nastiest deaths there is....</p>

<p>"But evidently they let me down in time and loosened the
rope from about my neck, for bye-and-bye I was staring up
at the stars and in full enjoyment of all my faculties....
Particularly the sense of smell....</p>

<p>"The intimate smell of Negro, in bulk, is like no
other smell in the world.... There is nothing else
like it, and there is nothing to which one can compare
it&mdash;and here is a curious fact which should interest
the psycho-physiologist.... Whenever I wake, as we of the
Zephyrs do, dumbly sweating or wildly shrieking, from
a ghastly nightmare, I can always <i>smell</i> Negro, most
distinctly.... Very disgusting....</p>

<p>"Curiously enough, these fearless savage fiends, who
will charge a machine-gun with the utmost bravery and with
a spear, are arrant cowards at night ... in mortal fear and
trembling horror of ten thousand different devils, ghosts,
djinns, ghouls, goblins and evil spirits.... And when I
came to, they were huddled around me for protection. I was
almost crushed and buried beneath the mass of them as they
lay pressed round and across me....</p>

<p>"As I was still most painfully bound, I can only suppose
that I was, in myself, a talisman, a <i>juju</i>, a mascot, or
shall I say, an <i>ikon</i>.</p>

<p>"And they had gathered around me in the spirit in which
simple peasants might gather round a Calvary, and were
using me as some might use a Cross, a holy relic or a
charm....</p>

<p>"Yes, to this day I smell that dreadful
odour&mdash;dreadful because of its associations, rather
than of itself&mdash;in my worst nightmares and delirium of
fever or of wounds....</p>

<p>"I can smell it at this moment....</p>

<p>"I have passed some bad nights&mdash;one, impaled on
bamboo stakes at Nha-Nam in Tonkin&mdash;but this was the
worst night of my life ... almost....</p>

<p>"And in the morning the ladies awoke, made no toilette,
and gave me no food....</p>

<p>"But they had given me a faint hope, for I could not
but realize that, so far, they had only tortured me by not
torturing me at all&mdash;and it seemed that they might be
keeping me, not only alive and whole, but without spot or
blemish, for some excellent purpose....</p>

<p>"They were!...</p>

<p>"And when I discovered it, I was inclined to wish that
they had killed me with fire or steel or cord&mdash;as they
did all of our men whom they took prisoner....</p>

<p>"For some reason, possibly on account of my unusual
size&mdash;I was a fine specimen in those days, six foot
six, and with golden hair and beard&mdash;they were taking
me to good King Behanzin at Kana, as an acceptable gift for
a burnt-offering and a bloody sacrifice unto his gods and
idols....</p>

<p>"There was a story afterwards, that Behanzin had been
told by his sooth-sayers and medicine-men, that he would
undoubtedly beat the French if a strong <i>juju</i> were made
with the blood of a white cock that had a golden comb....
One of our officers, Captain Battreau, said I probably owed
my life to my golden comb.... I have a very white skin
where I am not sunburnt....</p>

<p>"Anyhow, the ladies took me along&mdash;by the
inducement of <i>machete</i>-points and rhinoceros-hide whips
chiefly&mdash;to Kana....</p>

<p>"I don't know whether we marched for a day or for a
week.... Yes.... I was strong in those days ... for I
believe I ate nothing but raw carrion, and my arms were
bound to my body the whole time, as though with wire....</p>

<p>"Kana stands on a hill and is built of earth, clay,
and sun-baked bricks, inside a great high wall, yards in
thickness....</p>

<p>"We entered through a gate like a tunnel, and, by way
of filthy narrow red-earth streets, came to a second,
inner wall, which surrounded the royal palaces, <i>hareems</i>,
temples, and the House of Sacrifice....</p>

<p>"The yelling mob that had accompanied us from the
outer gate, crowding and jeering and throwing muck at
me&mdash;though they kept well out of reach of the weapons
of the Amazons&mdash;evidently feared to enter this inner
city, for that is what it amounted to....</p>

<p>"And I was handed over to a guard of long-speared
ruffians and filthy priests who slung me into a big
building and slammed the huge double gates.... As I
staggered forward in the darkness, I slipped on the
slimy, rounded cobble-stones, sprawled full-length and
collapsed....</p>

<p>"There was a loud roaring in my ears&mdash;not the
conventional roaring in the ears of a fainting man, but the
buzzing of millions of billions of trillions of huge flies,
that soon so completely covered me that you could not
have stuck a pin into my body without killing one. Their
blue-grey metallic bodies made me look as though I were
clad in a complete suit of chain-mail.... And I could not
move a finger even to clear my eyes.... I could only blink
them.</p>

<p>"And as my eyes grew accustomed to the gloom, I saw that
the whitish gleaming cobble-stones were the skulls of men,
sunk in the red earth.... And I realized why I was being
nauseated by a terrible slaughter-house stench....</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> a slaughter-house.... The House of Sacrifice,
of Kana, the Sacred City of King Behanzin of Dahomey....</p>

<p>"That was another unpleasant night, <i>mes amis</i>.... Oh,
quite unpleasant.... We are in clover here&mdash;pigs in
clover.... But, mercifully, I was at the end of my tether,
and I had now so little capacity for suffering, that I
was not clear in my mind as to whether certain things
that happened that night were real or imaginary, fact or
nightmare....</p>

<p>"They were real enough.... And in the morning
I found I was, even as I had either dreamed or
realized&mdash;actually inside a great wicker bottle or
basket, from the top of which my head protruded....</p>

<p>"I could not move a single muscle of my body save those
of my face....</p>

<p>"The priests and executioners had been busy during the
night, and I was now like a mummy in its bandages, neatly
encased in the Sacrificial Basket, all ready to play my
helpless part in the bloody ritual of their unspeakable
religion....</p>

<p>"Half-dead as I already was, my one hope was that the
Service would be short and early&mdash;the sacrifice soon
and quick.... It is most uncomfortable to lie in a bottle
with nothing to support your head....</p>

<p>"I could see nothing, and hear little, by reason of the
huge flies ... but I was aware of tom-toming and shouting
without, and hoped that it concerned me.... It did.... The
gates of the House of Sacrifice were thrown open and a
number of guards, priests, and executioners heaved me up
from that terrible floor and carried me outside.</p>

<p>"Oh, the sweetness of that morning air&mdash;even in an
African town.... It almost made me want to live.... And
oh, the relief to have one's head freed from an inch-thick
covering of flies....</p>

<p>"The great Square of the inner town&mdash;a Square
of which the sides were formed by, shall we say, the
Palaces, Cathedrals, Convents, Monasteries and Municipal
Buildings of King Behanzin&mdash;was thronged by hundreds
and hundreds of warriors, both men and women. As my guards
carried me across to the biggest of the buildings, all
these people fell back to the sides of the Square, leaving
the centre empty, save for me and my guards.</p>

<p>"In front of the palace, an ugly clumsy building of
red earth and baked clay bricks, sat Behanzin, King of
Dahomey, on the Royal Stool. Around him were grouped his
courtiers.... I think that His Majesty and they formed one
of the least pleasing groups of human beings I have ever
encountered&mdash;and I have known quite a lot of kings and
their ministers....</p>

<p>"As I have already observed, I do not speak Dahomeyan,
and at that moment I deeply regretted the fact, and equally
so, that none of them understood Russian or even French....
However, French I spoke, in the vain hope that a word or
two, here and there, might be understood.</p>

<p>"A few were, as I will tell you....</p>

<p>"My speech was brief and blunt.... I told Behanzin
that he was the nastiest king I knew ... the ugliest ...
the foulest ... the filthiest ... the most abandoned and
degraded.... And I should be much obliged if someone would
remove me from a world which he contaminated....</p>

<p>"I had not finished even these few and well-chosen words
before I was again seized by my porters and carried to the
very centre of the Square, and there abandoned.</p>

<p>"Immediately the Public, obviously well accustomed to
these out-door sports and pastimes, fell into perfectly
straight lines on each of the sides of the Square, and
assumed the position of sprinters at the starting-point of
a race&mdash;but each with a <i>coupe-coupe</i>, knife, axe or
spear in his right hand&mdash;and looked to His Majesty for
the signal.</p>

<p>"The King rose from his royal stool, raised his spear
aloft and gazed around....</p>

<p>"I also gazed around, having just grasped the underlying
idea of the National Sport, a game in which I had never
hitherto taken part, nor even seen....</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;how stupid of me&mdash;it was a
race-game, a go-as-you-please, run-walk-hop-or-jump.... And
my head was the prize!</p>

<p>"I wondered whether His Majesty had gathered that my
brief address was not couched in diplomatic language....
He certainly now prolonged what was, to me, a painful
moment.... He stood like an ebon statue, his white ostrich
feathers nodding in the breeze, his handsome cloak hanging
gracefully from his great shoulders, his spear uplifted,
motionless....</p>

<p>"When that spear fell, I knew that every competitor
of those hundreds surrounding me, would bound forward
like a greyhound unleashed. For a few seconds I should
see them race toward me, their bloodthirsty faces alight
with the lust of slaughter, their gleaming weapons raised
aloft.... And I should go down, the centre of a maelstrom
of clutching hands and hacking blades....</p>

<p>"I wondered what would be the reward of the proud winner
of the King's Trophy&mdash;the head of the white cock with
a golden comb ... the essential ingredient for the making
of the strong <i>juju</i> that was to defeat the French....</p>

<p>"That black devil, Behanzin, stood steady as a rock,
and there was absolute silence in that great Square, as
all awaited the fall of the flag, or rather the shining
spear-head....</p>

<p>"A woman, standing in a doorway, giggled nervously, and
a crouching sprinter, presumably her lord, looked back over
his shoulder&mdash;only to receive her sharp rebuke for
taking his eye off the ball....</p>

<p>"Another woman dashed forward and handed her husband
a <i>machete</i>, taking his spear back into the hut.... I
imagined his saying to her, just before he left the house,
'Tatiana, my dear, run upstairs and find that new <i>machete</i>
I ordered last week.... I think it's on the top of the
wardrobe in my dressing-room, unless that wretched girl has
put it somewhere.'...</p>

<p>"And then I glanced again at the King.... Even as I
did so, the raised spear-head, which probably had only
been uplifted for five seconds after all, began to travel
slowly backward.... And there was an audible intaking
of breath.... Evidently the giving of the signal had
begun, and in the fraction of a second, the broad, bright
spear-head would come flashing downward....</p>

<p>"I closed my eyes....</p>

<p>"<i>Boom ... BANG!</i></p>

<p>"I nearly jumped out of my bottle....</p>

<p>"<i>Boom ... BANG!</i></p>

<p>"Two shells had burst in Kana, one just above the inner
wall, the other in the corner of the Square itself....</p>

<p>"Our guns!... Our guns!...</p>

<p>"The runners were running indeed&mdash;for their <i>own</i>
heads.... King Behanzin 'also ran' ... if indeed he did not
get a win or a place....</p>

<p>"I was forgotten ... before ever the third and fourth
shells arrived.... Oh, God! I was <i>not</i> forgotten!... There
was <i>one</i> competitor left!... I supposed he felt attracted
by the walk-over.... As he dashed toward me, straight as an
arrow, yelling madly, a great spear in his hand, I saw that
he was one of the group of courtiers ... the man indeed who
had stood nearest to the King....</p>

<p>"I admit, <i>mes amis</i>, that it seemed to me a little
hard, more than a little hard, that with the flight of all
those hundreds and hundreds of murderous slayers, this
solitary one should prefer my life to his own ... should
not realize that the match was abandoned ... the race
scratched ... the proceedings postponed....</p>

<p>"A fellow of one idea.... A case of the <i>idée fixe</i>....
No sportsman, anyhow.... The sort of man that steals the
Gold Cup....</p>

<p>"I had been through so much, <i>mes amis</i>, from the time
that that Amazon had hit me on the head, that I really
rebelled a little at this last cruelty of a mocking
Fate.</p>

<p>"Saved by the bursting of the shells at the fifty-ninth
second of the fifty-ninth minute of the eleventh hour,
and then this one solitary, implacable madman to fail to
realize that I had been saved!...</p>

<p>"Nearer ... nearer ... he came&mdash;and by the time
that he was a few yards from me, he and I were alone in
that great Square....</p>

<p>"Would he drive that huge spear through my body, and
then clumsily hack my head off with the edge of its broad
blade?</p>

<p>"How I hoped that the next shell would blow his limbs
from his body, though it killed me too.... Another bound
and he would be on me.... I closed my eyes&mdash;and the
Nightmare Slayer flung his arm round me, and, in execrable
French, panted:</p>

<p>"'You tell Frenchies I be verra good man, massa.... I
belong Coast ... belong French shippy.... I good friend
loving Frenchies.... I interpreter.... I show Frenchies
where old Behanzin bury gin, rum, brandy, ivory....'</p>

<p>"Another shell burst.... And the Nightmare Slayer tipped
my basket over, and, flat upon the ground, the lion and the
lamb lay down together....</p>

<p>"That, <i>mes amis</i>, was how I nearly lost my head....</p>

<p>"We must not lose ours here, for, as you perceive,
there are far worse places than this one.... I rather like
it...." </p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p> A long heavy silence was broken by Jacob the Jew.</p>

<p>"The lad we want here is the bold bright Rastignac ...
Rastignac, the Mutineer...."</p>

<p>"Oh, did you know him?" said the Englishman.</p>

<p>"What <i>about</i> him?" asked the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"What about him? Ho, ho!... He gave the Government some
trouble, one way and another.... They stuck him in the
Zephyrs, but they didn't keep him long. What do you think
he did?...</p>

<p>"He used to carry a flexible saw-file round his upper
gums from one cheek to the other, and they <i>say</i> he carried
some little tool that he used to swallow&mdash;on the
end of a string, with the other end tied round a back
tooth&mdash;on search days.</p>

<p>"Well, he filed his manacles and got out.... And he
killed two sentries, absolutely silently, by stabbing them
in the back of the neck with a long darning-needle, to
which he had fitted a tiny wooden handle.... There is a
spot, you know, at the base of the brain, just where the
skull rests on the backbone.... The point of a needle in
<i>there</i> ... just in the right spot ... and <i>pouff</i>!...</p>

<p>"Rastignac knew the spot, all-right. And when he was
clear, and dressed in a dead sentry's uniform, did he run
off like any other escaping prisoner?... Not he.... He
broke into a Public Works Department shed ... took a pot
of black paint, and a pot of white, and some brushes, and
marched off at daybreak, as bold as brass...."</p>

<p>"Where to?" inquired the American.</p>

<p>"To the nearest milestone," chuckled Jacob the Jew, "...
and neatly touched up the black <i>kilometre</i> figures and
their white border.... And then to the next.... And the
next....</p>

<p>"When patrols passed, he gave them good-day and
exchanged jokes and the latest news, for cigarettes and
a drink.... They say he visited several camps and made
himself useful, with his paint, to one or two officers, and
reported some rascal who had smeared one of his nice black
figures because he wouldn't give him tobacco!...</p>

<p>"And so he painted his way, milestone by milestone, to
Oran, where he reported himself, produced the dead sentry's
<i>livret</i> and leave-papers, and was wafted comfortably, by
<i>Messageries Maritimes</i>, to France...."</p>

<p>"Well, and what would he do if he were here?" asked a
querulous voice. "We may suppose that your Rastignac had
neither the wings nor feet of a fly.... And if he were
here and got us out, where could we go?... More likely to
have caused the death of us all.... Like those two devils
Dubitsch and Barre nearly did to their gang...."</p>

<p>"What was that?" asked Badineff.</p>

<p>"Why, these two unutterable swine were with a
working-party in the <i>zone dissidente</i>, and at night were
in a little perimeter-camp made with dry cactus and thick
heavy thorn.... Their beautiful scheme&mdash;and they
nearly brought it off&mdash;was to creep out on a windy
night and to set fire to these great thorn-walls of the
zareba! This stuff burns like paper, and they'd got hold
of some matches.... It mattered nothing to them that the
remaining ninety-eight of their fellow-convicts would
inevitably be roasted to death in the process.... Those
two would easily escape in the confusion, while the men of
the escort were vainly doing their best to save the rest
of the wretched prisoners.... <i>Their</i> position, as you
may imagine, would be just that of a bundle of mice tied
together by their tails and packed round with cotton-wool
soaked in kerosene....</p>

<p>"As luck would have it&mdash;the luck of the other
ninety-eight, anyhow&mdash;the first match was blown out,
and a sentry had seen the glare of it.... He fired and
challenged after, wounding Dubitsch and so flustering
Barre, who had the matches, that he dropped the lot and
was unable to strike another before the sentry was upon
him...."</p>

<p>"What happened then?" asked the Englishman.</p>

<p>"The Sergeant-Major in charge of the escort simply
returned them to their place in the gang&mdash;but
took care that the gang should know exactly what had
happened...."</p>

<p>"And then?..." prompted the Englishman, when the man
stopped, as one who had said enough....</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;they died ... they died.... They died that
same night, of something or other.... Judging from their
faces, they had not died happily...."</p>

<p>"Sounds as though you saw them," observed Jacob the
Jew.</p>

<p>"Quite," observed the narrator laconically.</p>

<p>"Not like poor dear little Tou-tou Boil-the-Cat,"
observed Jacob.</p>

<p>"What happened to him?" asked the Querulous Voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, he died ... he died.... He died suddenly, one
night, of something or other.... But no-one was able to
judge from his face whether he died happily or not...."</p>

<p>"Tell us about him," suggested the American.</p>

<p>"About Tou-tou Boil-the-Cat?... He wasn't a nice man....
Made quite a name for himself, Montmartre way, before he
went to the Legion.... There was some talk about a Lovely
Lady, the Queen of his Band.... Wonderful golden hair....
Known to all kind friends as <i>Casque d'Or</i>.... They say he
cut it off.... Her head, I mean.... Got into bad trouble in
the Legion too.... Life sentence in the Zephyrs....</p>

<p>"A brave little man, but he hadn't the other virtue
that one rather demands.... No.... Something of a
stool-pigeon.... There were thirteen convicts in a tent
... a most unlucky number ... but it was soon reduced
to twelve, through M'sieu Tou-tou Boil-the-Cat giving
information that affected the career&mdash;indeed,
abbreviated it&mdash;of one of his comrades....</p>

<p>"Yes ... thirteen went forth from that tent to labour
in the interests of France's colonial expansion that sunny
morning, and only twelve returned to it, to sleep the sleep
of the unjust, that dewy eve.... A round dozen....</p>

<p>"But they did not sleep through the stilly night,
though the night remained quite stilly.... And behold,
when another bright day broke, those twelve were now
eleven....</p>

<p>"The guard, who was but a simple peasant man, could
<i>not</i> make the count come to more than eleven.... The
corporal&mdash;possibly a shade more intelligent, could
not by any means make the count a dozen.... The Sergeant,
a man who could count quite well, swore there were but
ten and one.... Not the Commandant himself could make us
twelve!...</p>

<p>"With the help of a bottle of absinthe he might make us
twenty-two&mdash;but even then he realized that he should
have seen twenty-four....</p>

<p>"No.... Tou-tou Boil-the-Cat was gone.... Gone like a
beautiful dream ... or like the foul brutish nightmare that
he was....</p>

<p>"And that, you know, puzzled our kind superiors....</p>

<p>"For, as it happened, it was quite impossible for
anyone to have escaped from the camp that night&mdash;full
moon, double sentries, constant patrols, and all-night
wakefulness and uneasiness on account of expected Arab
attack....</p>

<p>"But gone he had....</p>

<p>"We were interrogated severally, and collectively, and
painfully ... until they must have admired our staunchness
and the wonderful cleverness of the missing man....</p>

<p>"We eleven slept in the tent for a month ... and the
country round was scoured until not one grain of sand
was left upon another, and there was not a locust, a
scorpion, a serpent nor a vulture, whose <i>dossier</i> was not
known....</p>

<p>"And at the end of a month the whole camp moved
on...."</p>

<p>"Did they ever find him?" asked Badineff.</p>

<p>"No ... <i>they</i> didn't," was the reply. "The jackals
found him...."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Under the sand that had formed the floor of the tent of
the eleven ..." was the answer.</p>

<p>"Sounds as though you were there ..." said the Querulous
Voice.</p>

<p>"Quite ..." replied Jacob the Jew, and yawned. </p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p> The sun had risen and set once more, causing a spot of
light to travel slowly across a portion of the interior of
the <i>silo</i>, with the search-light effect of illuminating
brilliantly the tiny area upon which it rested, while
leaving the rest of the place in darkness darker than that
of night.</p>

<p>There was curiously little movement, and less sound, in
the <i>silo</i>&mdash;the uneasy stirring of a nightmare-ridden
sleeper, a heavy sigh, a faint groan, the clank of a chain.
Talk had ceased, and scarcely a sentence had been uttered
for hours.</p>

<p>The last subject of general conversation had been that
of the cause of their abandonment to a lingering and
terrible death in that dreadful tomb. Speculation had
wandered from sudden Arab attack and the annihilation of
the Company, to the familiar theory of wanton malice and
deliberate devilish punishment. Men, condemned from the
Legion for military "crimes," had advanced the former
theory; civilian prison criminals, the latter.</p>

<p>The Frenchman who had attempted to recite the Burial
Service had accepted neither of these views.</p>

<p>"We are <i>forgotten</i>," he had said.... "We are the
Forgotten of Man, as distinguished from our friends the
Touareg, the Forgotten of God. It is perfectly simple, and
I can tell you exactly how it happened.</p>

<p>"As you may be aware, <i>mes amis</i>, a list of <i>les hommes
punis</i> is made out, by the clerk of the <i>Adjudant</i>, every
morning, before the guard is changed. The form on which he
writes the names is divided into columns showing the class
of punishment and the number of days each man has still to
do.... And the clerk of the <i>Adjudant</i>, God forgive him,
has written the number of our days under the heading <i>salle
de police</i>, or <i>cellules</i>, or <i>consigne</i>, and has left the
column 'prison,' blank. So, each day, our sentences are
being reduced by one day, in those places where we are not,
and the Sergeant of the Guard for each day, observes that
there are no men in '<i>prison</i>,' for the column so headed
is blank.... We are <i>not</i> in 'prison' because we are not
recorded as being in 'prison'&mdash;and therefore we cannot
be released from 'prison.'..."</p>

<p>And Jacob the Jew had observed:</p>

<p>"Convincing and very cheering.... Monsieur must have
been a lawyer before he left the world."</p>

<p>And the man had replied:</p>

<p>"No.... An officer.... Captain of Spahis and in the
Secret Service&mdash;about to die, and unashamed....
<i>No!</i>&mdash;I should say <i>Légionnaire</i> Rien of the Seventh
Company of the Third Battalion of the First Regiment of the
Foreign Legion.... I was wandering in my mind...." </p>

<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p> "Tell me," said Jacob the Jew (or Jacopi Judescu, the
Roumanian gypsy). "What was really your reason for that
sloppy feeble 'kindness' to Ramon Gonzales.... I am a
philosopher and a student of that lowest of the animals,
called Man.... Was it to please your Christian God and
to acquire merit?... Or to up-hold your insolent British
assumption of an inevitable and natural superiority?...
You and your God&mdash;the Great Forgivers!... 'Injure
me&mdash;and I'll forgive you <i>and</i> make you feel so damned
uncomfortable that you'll be more injured than I am.' ...
Aren't you <i>capable</i> of a good decent hate or ..."</p>

<p>"Yes. I hate your filthy voice, dear Jacob," replied the
Englishman.</p>

<p>"No. Tell me," persisted Jacob. "I loathe being
puzzled.... Besides, don't you see I'm going mad.... Talk,
man.... These corpses.... Why did you behave like that to
Ramon Gonzales?... He betrayed you, didn't he?... I would
have strangled him.... I would have had his eyes.... Didn't
he betray and denounce you after you had found him in the
desert and saved his life?... To Sergeant Lebaudy?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He recognized me&mdash;and did his,
ah&mdash;duty," was the reply.</p>

<p>"For twenty-five pieces of silver!... Recognized you as
one of the Zinderneuf men he knew at Sidi, and promptly
sold you?...</p>

<p>"Consigned you to sudden death&mdash;or a lingering
death&mdash;for twenty-five francs and a Sergeant's
favour!... And here the Judas was&mdash;wondrously
delivered into your hand&mdash;and you 'forgave' him and
comforted him!... Now <i>why</i>?... What was the game, the
motive, the reason, the object? Why should a sane man act
like that?... What <i>was</i> the game?"</p>

<p>"No game, no motive, no reason," answered the
Englishman. "He acted according to his lights&mdash;I to
mine."</p>

<p>"And where do you get your 'lights'? What flame lit
them?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I don't know.... Home.... Family.... One's
women-folk.... School.... Upbringing.... Traditions....
One unconsciously imbibes ideas of doing the decent
thing.... I've been extraordinarily lucky in life.... Poor
old Ramon wasn't.... One does the decent thing if one
is&mdash;decent."</p>

<p>"You don't go about, then, consciously and definitely
forgiving your enemies and heaping coals of fire on them
because you're a Christian."</p>

<p>"No, of course not.... Don't talk rot...."</p>

<p>"Nor with a view to securing a firm option on a highly
eligible and desirable mansion in the sky&mdash;suitable
for English gentleman of position&mdash;one of the most
favourable residential sites on the Golden Street...."</p>

<p>"Not in the least.... Don't be an ass...."</p>

<p>"You disappoint me. I was hoping to find, before I died,
one of those rare animals, a Christian gentleman&mdash;who
does all these funny things <i>because</i> he is a
Christian&mdash;and this was positively my last chance....
I shall die in here."</p>

<p>"I expect Christianity <i>was</i> the flame that lit those
little 'lights,' Jacob.... Our home and school and social
customs, institutions and ideas are based on the Christian
ideal, anyhow.... And we owe what's good in them to that I
believe.... We get our <i>beau idéal</i> quite unconsciously,
I think, and we follow it quite unconsciously&mdash;if we
follow it at all...."</p>

<p>"Well, and what <i>is</i> it, my noble Christian martyr?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just to be&mdash;decent, and to do the decent
thing, y'know."</p>

<p>"So, indirectly, at any rate, you returned good for evil
to Judas Ramon Gonzales because you were a Christian, you
think?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... Indirectly ... I suppose.... We aren't good at
hating and vengeance and all that.... It's not done.... It
isn't&mdash;decent...."</p>

<p>"But you puzzle me. What of Ramon the Judas ... Ramon
who sold you? He was a <i>great</i> Christian, you know.... A
staunch patron of your Christian God.... Always praying and
invoking your Holy Family."</p>

<p>"There are good and bad in all religions, Jacob.... I
have the highest admiration for your great people&mdash;but
I have met rotten specimens.... Bad as some of my
own...."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Silence.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"Look here, Christian," began Jacob the Jew again. "If I
summoned up enough strength, and swung this chain with all
my might against your right cheek, would you turn the other
also?"</p>

<p>"No. I should punch you on the nose," said the
Englishman simply.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"Tell me. Do you kneel down night and morning and pray
to your kind Christian God, Englishman? The forgiving
God of Love, Who has landed you <i>here</i>?" asked Jacob the
Jew.</p>

<p>"I landed myself here," was the reply.
"And&mdash;er&mdash;no.... I don't pray&mdash;in
words&mdash;much.... You won't mind asking questions
for fear of being thought inquisitive, will you, gentle
Jacob?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no.... Let's see now.... You forgive the very
worst of injuries because you are a Christian, but not
<i>because</i> you're a Christian.... You do as you would be
done by, and not as you've been 'done' by.... You don't
pray in words, and hold daily communion with your kind
Christian God&mdash;you regard Him as a gentleman&mdash;an
English gentleman of course&mdash;who quite understands,
and merely desires that you be&mdash;decent, which of
course, you naturally would be, whether He wished it or
not.... And you'll punch me on the nose if I smite you on
the cheek&mdash;but you don't even do that much to anyone
who betrays you to a dreadful death.... And really, in your
nice little mind, you loathe talking about your religion,
and you are terrified lest you give the impression that you
think it is better than other people's, for fear of hurting
their feelings...."</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up, Jacob. You'd talk the hind leg off a
dog."</p>

<p>"What else is there to do but talk?... And so you are
perfectly certain that you are a most superior person, but
you strive your very utmost to conceal the awful fact....
You're a puzzling creature.... What is your motivating
force? What is your philosophy? What are you <i>up</i>
to?..."</p>

<p>"Well, at the moment, I'm going to issue the
water-ration.... Last but one...." said the Englishman.</p>

<p>"I can't understand you English...." grumbled Jacob.</p>

<p>"A common complaint, I believe," said the Englishman.
The quiet American laughed. </p>

<h3>§ 6</h3>

<p> "Should any gentleman here survive, I wonder if
he would be so extremely obliging as to write to my
Mother," said the French ex-officer later. "She is an old
lady&mdash;quite alone&mdash;and she foolishly cherishes a
fondness for a most unworthy son.... Darling Mother!..."</p>

<p>The Englishman and the American memorized an address in
Paris, and each declared that he would not only write to
Madame de Lannec, but would visit her, give her her son's
last message, and assure her of his gentle happy death from
honourable wounds received in the service of France, and
describe his grand military funeral.</p>

<p>Neither of these two men would admit that he also was
already in his grave.</p>

<p>"Been in lots of tighter places than this," said the
Englishman.</p>

<p>"I've been nearer death too," observed the American.
"Been dead really.... In this same Zaguig...."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;an unpleasant place, Zaguig," said the
Frenchman, "I know it well," and added, "I, too, have
occasionally been in danger.... But I finish here...."</p>

<p>"Never say die," urged the American. "Personally, I
refuse to die.... I've got a job to do, and I intend to
live until it's done...."</p>

<p>"Same here," agreed the Englishman. "I must be getting
home to tea shortly.... My wife...." He coughed.</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>mes amis</i>, you wish to live.... I, on the
contrary, wish to die," whispered the Frenchman, and
shortly after became delirious and raved&mdash;of
"Véronique," of a terrible painter and his devilish
picture, of a Colonel of Chasseurs d'Afrique, of a Moor
of the Zarhoun whom the speaker had apparently killed
with his bare hands, and of his mother.... But chiefly of
"Véronique"&mdash;until he sank into a state of coma.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>In the morning, the spot of light fell on his face and
he awoke and, from time to time, spoke rationally, though
he did not appear to realize where he was.</p>

<p>He desired the services of a priest, that he might "make
his soul." On either side of him, the Englishman and the
American did what they could to soothe his passing, and
Jacob the Jew produced his last scrap of biscuit for the
nourishment of the sick man.... He offered to chew it for
him if he were unable to masticate....</p>

<p>"It's a privilege to die in your society, <i>mes amis</i>,"
said the Frenchman suddenly, in a stronger voice. "To die
with men of one's own sort.... Officers once, doubtless,
and gentlemen still.... I am going to add to the burden of
debt I owe you.... But I am going to give you something
in return.... My dying assurance that you are going to
live.... I most clearly see you walking in the sunshine,
free and happy.... Walking towards a woman&mdash;a truly
beautiful woman.... She loves you both&mdash;but one far
more than the other.... You fight on her account ...
your weapons are generosity, unselfishness, sacrifice,
self-abnegation, the love of a man for his friend...."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Silence.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"Poor chap," murmured the Englishman, staring across
at the almost indistinguishable form of the American.
"Wandering again.... He seemed better...."</p>

<p>No reply came from the darkness where the other crouched
beside the dying man.</p>

<p>"And this is the further request I have to make of
you.... Will one of you go to the little cemetery and stand
by her grave and say:</p>

<p>"'<i>As he died he spoke of you.... He spoke only words
of kindness and love.... He did not breathe one word of
reproach.... Only kindness, love and gratitude.</i>'</p>

<p>"She will be able to understand&mdash;now....</p>

<p>"And will you take violets&mdash;a few violets, from
me.... Always they were her flower.... A few of the
beautiful big violets that welcome one home from Africa....
Once I kissed an old grandmother who was selling them on
the <i>quai</i> at Marseilles, and gave her a gold piece....
They were not violets she sold to me.... They were <i>France</i>
... they were <i>Home</i> ... they were <i>Véronique</i>.... Their
odour was the distilled soul of the sweetness of all that
is in those three wonderful words.... France, Home and
Beauty....</p>

<p>"Oh, God ... I can smell violets....</p>

<p>"Véronique, did ever you see violets again without
thinking of me? Did I ever see them again without trembling
from head to foot, without wondering how my frozen brain
could function ... how my burning heart could beat....</p>

<p>"Forgive me, gentlemen.... But you never saw her....
She was God's triumph.... Yes, often I called her, 'You
Evidence of God'&mdash;for such beauty and wonder and
untellable glory of womanhood was final proof to me of the
existence of a great good God of Beauty.</p>

<p>"And Beauty <i>is</i> Truth&mdash;and Goodness."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Silence.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Jacob the Jew crawled painfully toward the spot of
light.</p>

<p>"You can give him my water-ration," he croaked.</p>

<p>"<i>Stout fella!</i>" said the Englishman, in his
mother-tongue.</p>

<p>The American started, as a slight jingle of iron
indicated.</p>

<p>"<i>Say that again, will you?</i>" he said in English.</p>

<p>"I said, '<i>Stout fella</i>'," replied the Englishman.</p>

<p>"<i>Merciful God!</i>" whispered the American; and the
dying Frenchman raised himself on his right elbow, and
endeavoured to point with his left hand.</p>

<p>"<i>Véronique!</i>" he cried. "I did my best.... I <i>did</i> save
you from Dummarcq&mdash;the great César Dummarcq&mdash;the
world-famous painter, the idol of Paris, the huge vile
pig, the half-mad cruel devil.... No&mdash;<i>he is
there!</i>... Do not move!... Do not stir hand or foot ... a
hair's-breadth&mdash;or he will shoot.... He will shoot
<i>you</i>, not me, the fiend!"</p>

<p>He sank back upon the ground.</p>

<p>"Dearest Mother!... I nearly broke your heart when I
told you I would marry her.... And you nearly broke mine
when you said that I should not.... An artists' model....
True.... César Dummarcq's model.... But a model of beauty
and grace.... Lovely in all her ways and thoughts and
movements.... César Dummarcq's model.... But a model for
all women to copy.... Every fascination and charm of
mind as well&mdash;witty and clever and of the sweetest
disposition.... With her, one laughed.... One laughed the
whole day through....</p>

<p>"Oh, but she was <i>dear</i>&mdash;dear and sweet and a
living charm.... Was it her fault that she had no heart?
No fairy, mermaid, elf, sprite, no magic princess from the
golden castle on the crystal hill, ever <i>has</i> a heart!...
So I gave her mine&mdash;to break....</p>

<p>"Oh, that terrible picture!... Véronique, how was I
to know that he had painted us, all save the last few
touches?... The jealous devil!... He did not even love
you.... You were merely his model, his chattel, his
property.... No one must take you from him&mdash;not even
to marry you....</p>

<p>"Behind that sinister black curtain.... A pistol in
his hand.... My arms about you as I implored you to be my
wife.... Your terrible shriek as you saw him appear ...
smiling ... smiling ..."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Silence.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>The Frenchman's voice changed completely. It was as
though an entirely different personality possessed his
body.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;don't move, my young cub!... Move hand or
foot, and our fair and frail young friend will have her
beauty marred!... Oh, a <i>great</i> picture!... <i>'FEAR!'
by César Dummarcq</i> ... the greatest portrayer of human
emotions, of all time.... Yes ... <i>'FEAR!'</i>... Do you
<i>fear</i>, little cockerel?... Do you fear you have brought
death to your mistress?... I <i>am</i> Death!... Death the
great Artist!... Oh, ho! his macabre compositions!... His
lovely colours of corruption and decay!... The great César
Dummarcq's greatest picture&mdash;<i>'FEAR!'</i>... Now keep
still.... See, I lay the pistol on this table beside the
easel.... Ah! <i>would</i> you!... You'd rise from that rug,
would you!... <i>Down</i>, dog!... Would you murder this woman
whom you love so much?... That's better....</p>

<p>"No, my dear Véronique, do not faint.... Just a
minute.... Your glazing eyes staring from the white mask
of your face.... <i>'FEAR!'</i> Aha!... Wonderful models!...
One has to go to some trouble to find them, of course....
That's right, popinjay&mdash;excellent!... Moisten your
lips with your tongue again.... See, little pimp, I think
I will shoot her, after all&mdash;as I have finished
her face.... Yes&mdash;you a little later.... Another
marvellous picture!... She lies on the divan&mdash;same
attitude&mdash;blood on her breast, a thin stream
trickling down her white arm, a stain on the white
bear-skin&mdash;lovely colours!... And you?... One arm
and your head and shoulders across her body.... The rest
of you on the rug&mdash;much the same position as now....
A bullet-hole beneath your ear.... I am not too near,
here, I think.... No.... What shall we call the second
picture?... <i>'REVENGE!'</i>... No, a little banal.... What
about <i>'FINIS!'</i>... No.... No name at all, I think&mdash;<i>a
'problem' picture</i>....</p>

<p>"Oh?... You think <i>I</i>'ll make a fine picture on the
guillotine, do you?... That's where you're wrong, puppy....
This is going to be a <i>crime passionel</i>.... Glorious
advertisement for the great César Dummarcq.... Anyhow, the
present picture is going marvellously....</p>

<p>"<i>'FEAR!'</i>... Never was <i>FEAR</i> so portrayed before....
Hi! <i>Down</i>, dog! There ... That bullet stirred her hair....
Stirred your heart too by the look of you, you little
hound...."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Silence.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"<i>Ce bon Monsieur César Dummarcq</i> would seem to have
been a gentleman with a sense of humour," murmured Jacob.
"I would we had him here."</p>

<p>"To jest with us?" inquired the Englishman.</p>

<p>"No, for us to jest with <i>him</i>, I think," replied
Jacob.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Silence.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"Water!" gasped the Frenchman.</p>

<p>"Mine," said Jacob.</p>

<p>"We'll all contribute," said the American.</p>

<p>The Englishman took the jug to the ray of light and
carefully measured water into an iron mug.</p>

<p>"A good spoonful each, left," he said, stepping gingerly
between two corpses.</p>

<p>The Frenchman drank avidly. Upon this little stream of
life-giving water his conscious mind seemed to be borne to
the surface.</p>

<p>"Thank you!... Thank you, gentlemen!" he said. "I do
hope I have not drunk more than my share.... I was not
noticing.... One of you will see to that for me, will you
not?... Get them on the <i>quai</i> at Marseilles, and put them
on her grave in the little cemetery...."</p>

<p>"Why certainly, of course," said the American. "Where is
it?"</p>

<p>"... And tell her that my last thoughts were of her....
She will understand now.... She understood nothing when
she died.... She was like that when I saved her from the
Beni Zarkesh.... God is very good and He had taken away her
understanding...."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Silence.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"... That roof.... In the starlight.... He was twice as
big and strong as I, that Moor.... But I killed him with my
bare hands, as I had killed the watchman dozing at the foot
of the stair.... Oh, that lovely silent struggle, with my
hands at his throat....</p>

<p>"And she thought I was de Chaumont, her Colonel of
Chasseurs d'Afrique.... His name was Charles.... She
called me '<i>Charles</i>' as I carried her to the horses....
She called me '<i>Charles</i>' through the brief remainder of
her life.... She died calling me '<i>Charles</i>.'... A little
hard for me to bear.... Yes, I suffered a little.... I had
thought bitterly of Charles de Chaumont and I had written
him a rather terrible letter when, on the strength of his
rank and seniority, he declined my challenge to a duel....
But I am grateful to him for his kindness to her, and for
making her so happy all those years.... He must have loved
her truly.... Who could help it?... And how she loved
him!... She must have been happy as the day is long, for
she had changed but little.... A girl when I lost her....
A woman when I found her.... Even more beautiful, if
that were possible.... The mad are often very lovely....
An unearthly beauty.... Very terrible.... But I firmly
believe her last days were happy.... She had forgotten that
<i>hareem</i>.... And I was her adored <i>Charles de Chaumont</i>!...
Yes.... Unconscious fingers can play a fearful threnody
upon our heart-strings.... Can break them one by one....
<i>Véronique ... Véronique</i> ..."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Silence.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"Is he dead?" asked Jacob, later.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Englishman, and coughed slightly.</p>

<p>"Well, do you know," said Jacob, "I think I shall join
him. I have always been deeply interested in the Hereafter,
and I confess to being a little weary of the Here.... Yes,
I think it's time to go."</p>

<p>"Are you talking about committing suicide?" asked the
American.</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Jacob. "I am talking about being
murdered and taking it upon me to shorten the process. I
have no strong views on the subject of man murdering his
fellow-man on the scaffold, or against the wall at dawn.
But this slow murder is quite indefensible, and I feel
justified in expediting my end."</p>

<p>"You'll look a most awful ass if they remember us and a
release-party comes, after all," said the Englishman.</p>

<p>"I shall look very nasty, anyhow, by the time a
release-party comes," was the reply. "So will you, my
friends. And you will have suffered a few hours or a few
days longer than I.... Either the Company has moved on, and
there are a few more miles of the Zaguig-Great Oasis Road,
marked, or else there was a sudden raid and the Company is
obliterated.... Anyhow&mdash;I've had enough."</p>

<p>"Don't give up, Jacob. Don't be a coward," said the
Englishman.</p>

<p>"No, I will not give up&mdash;my right to dispose of
myself; the only right left to me," was the answer. "No,
I will not be a coward who dare not step uninvited into
the next world.... What do you do, my friend if you sit
on a tin-tack? You promptly remove yourself. I am going
to remove myself. I have already sat too long upon this
particular&mdash;ah&mdash;tin-tack."</p>

<p>"Rot," said the Englishman.</p>

<p>"You're beat," said the American.</p>

<p>"You can't commit suicide," said the Englishman.</p>

<p>"It isn't&mdash;'decent,' I suppose," smiled Jacob.</p>

<p>"That's it," said the Englishman. "It's a rotten thing
to do. One doesn't commit suicide! It's not done. It
isn't&mdash;er&mdash;decent."</p>

<p>"A matter of opinion," said the Jew. "Is it better and
wiser to suffer indescribable agonies of the mind, and
ghastly tortures of the body, for days, hours, or seconds?
It seems to me to be more logical to let it be a matter of
seconds."</p>

<p>"Well, logic isn't everything," said the Englishman.
"Most of our best impulses and ideas are illogical.... Damn
logic.... Love is illogical."</p>

<p>"Surely," said the American.</p>

<p>"Yes. Life is illogical and death is illogical,
and God is illogical," said Jacob. "And it is also
perfectly illogical to lie here and die of thirst,
starvation, heat, suffocation and insects for another
twenty-four hours when you can do it in twenty-four
seconds.... Good-bye, my friends! May we meet again and
discuss our discoveries concerning God, Jehovah, Allah,
Christ, Mahomet, Buddha and the other manifestations of
man's incurable anthropomorphism.... <i>Adieu!</i> Or <i>au
revoir</i>&mdash;whichever it may prove to be."</p>

<p>"Hi! Here! Hold on!" cried the Englishman.</p>

<p>"You! Jacob!" called the American.</p>

<p>"Well?" chuckled the Jew.</p>

<p>"Look here," said the Englishman, "be decent, Jacob. You
objected to Ramon dying at all."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;he was the first," replied Jacob, "and there
was some hope then.... There are only we three now, and
one more corpse will not further discommode you. I beg you
to believe me that I would not have done this were all the
others still alive&mdash;not even though I knew there would
be no release....</p>

<p>"To have done that would not have been&mdash;'decent,'"
he added with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"Look here, Jacob, will you do me a favour?" asked the
Englishman.</p>

<p>"I shall be most delighted," was the reply. "It will
be my last opportunity. And it will have to be soon," he
added, his weak voice growing perceptibly weaker.</p>

<p>"Well, I want you to promise to wait another day,"
said the Englishman. "Only another twenty-four hours.
Just till the spot of light falls on the Frenchman's body
again...."</p>

<p>"Come on, Jacob," urged the American. "Stick it till
then. Please yourself after that. But I believe we'll be
saved to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Too late," was the whispered reply. "I have opened a
vein.... When you want it, you'll find the piece of steel
in my right hand ... razor-edge one side, saw-edge the
other ... Pluck up your courage and come along with me,
both of you...."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Silence.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>A deep sigh.</p>

<p>The Englishman and the American found it was indeed too
late. </p>

<h3>§ 7</h3>

<p> "<i>Now</i>, my friend," said the American, "we can attend
to our own little affairs!... Do you know that our meeting
in here is one of the most astounding things that have ever
happened?... Do you know you are <i>the one man in all the
world I have been looking for</i>!... And <i>this</i> is where I
find you!... I did my damnedest&mdash;and then Providence
took a hand.... Heaven helps those, etc...."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I don't quite understand," began the
Englishman.</p>

<p>"You certainly don't.... I don't myself.... We're
dreaming, of course. It's delirium. We aren't in any
<i>silo</i>.... <i>You aren't John Geste.</i>"</p>

<p>"But I <i>am</i> John Geste!" gasped the Englishman.</p>

<p>"You aren't John Geste and I didn't spot you directly
you said '<i>Stout fella</i>,' in English. And I didn't hear you
call your wife 'Stout fella' at Brandon Abbas when you were
kids and ... Oh, my God!</p>

<p>"Where's your hand, man.... Oh, <i>John Geste! John
Geste!</i>... We'll be out of here to-morrow, boy.... We
<i>can't</i> die here. God doesn't mean us to die and rot in
this hole that was ordained to be our meeting-place....
Ordained from the beginning of Time as the place where I
should find you, after all.... And Isobel's well and only
waiting to be happy as soon as she hears you're coming home
to&mdash;er&mdash;tea, John Geste!... And I was to tell
you Michael didn't take the 'Blue Water' from under the
cover. It wasn't he who stole it.... And I'm going mad,
John Geste&mdash;mad with joy&mdash;and starvation, and
weakness, and happiness...."</p>

<p>"Hadn't noticed the happiness much," said the
Englishman. "What are you gibbering about, my dear chap?
Who <i>are</i> you? How do you know my name&mdash;and about
Isobel?"</p>

<p>He coughed slightly. "I'm delirious, I suppose.... Both
delirious.... Both dreaming...."</p>

<p>"We're both dreaming the same dream then, John Geste....
I want to tell you...."</p>

<p>An ominous clink of metal and a sigh were audible above
the feeble croaking of his voice.</p>

<p>"Here, what's up?... You listening?... Here, <i>wake
up</i>."</p>

<p>The Englishman had collapsed and lay inert,
unresponsive, either in a faint or the last sleep of all.
</p>

<h3>§ 8</h3>

<p> The arrival of the spot of sunlight found the American
moistening the lips of the dying Englishman with the
remaining drops of water.</p>

<p>"Worn out," he murmured later. "God! I feel as strong as
a horse now!... He had given up hope before I recognized
him.... Oh, Isobel ... I've found him and he's dying....
No, God can't mean that.... I'm talking out loud. I must
catch hold of myself.... Help me, God, for I am going to
help myself&mdash;to help them."</p>

<p>The American crawled across to where lay the body of the
strange man known to his fellows as Jacob the Jew.</p>

<p>Feeling over the corpse he found the right hand and in
it a piece of wonderfully-tempered steel, which, together
with a few matches, the man had somehow hidden from those
whose duty it had been to search him. Securing it, he
returned to the side of the Englishman, and once again
endeavoured to revive him.</p>

<p>Panic seized him as he realized his efforts were
unavailing. Putting his lips to the ear of the unconscious
man, he whispered urgently, and his whisper quickly grew to
a hoarse shout.</p>

<p>"<i>John Geste! John Geste! Come back, John Geste!</i>
Come <i>back</i>, man! You <i>can't</i> die! You can't die, <i>now</i>,
John Geste! I've <i>found</i> you.... <i>Hi! John Geste!</i> Think
of Isobel.... Isobel!... Isobel!! <i>Isobel!!!</i> Do you
hear me?... Do you hear me, John? Fight, man! Fight for
your life!... Think how Beau would have fought!... Beau
Geste.... Think how Digby would have fought.... Digby
Geste.... Fight, John!... Fight for Isobel.... Come
back.... Isobel!... Isobel!! <i>Isobel!!!</i>"</p>

<p>As though the name had reached his semi-conscious mind,
the dying man stirred. The other crowed inarticulately, and
suddenly fell quiet.</p>

<p>"Wish I knew something more about that blood-transfusion
stunt," he murmured in his normal voice, as he deeply
incised the side of his wrist, forced open his companion's
mouth, and pressed the bleeding wrist firmly against it.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, son," he said, and laughed hysterically. </p>

<h2><a id="sov"></a>THE STORY OF OTIS VANBRUGH </h2>

<p class="quote"><i>A man's place in the scale of civilization is
shown by his attitude to women. There are men who regard
a woman as something to live with. There are others who
regard her as someone to live for.</i></p>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="first">
I shall never forget my first sight of Isobel
Rivers&mdash;a somewhat foolish remark, in view of the fact
that I have never forgotten any glimpse I have ever had of
her. I don't think I have even forgotten any word that she
has ever said to me. Nay, more, I do not believe I have
forgotten any word that I have ever said to her.</p>

<p>It was, as was most fitting, one of those truly glorious
English spring mornings when one is consciously glad to be
alive, and unconsciously aware that God's in His Heaven and
all's well with the world.</p>

<p>I was on a visit to the home of my maternal grandmother
at Brandon Regis and had that morning walked out from the
big old house which was half farm and half manor, where
my yeoman ancestors had lived since Domesday Book, or
before.</p>

<p>I suppose it was the utter glory of that lovely morning,
and not a premonition that this was to be an epochal day in
my life, that made me feel so joyously exalted.</p>

<p>I had walked a mile or so, in the direction of Brandon
Abbas, and was seated on a gate that opened into one of
those neat and tidy English fields that always look to me
as though they were tended rather by parlour-maids than
by agricultural labourers. I was whistling merrily, and
probably quite tunelessly, when a dog-cart, its small body
perched high on big spidery wheels, came smartly round a
bend in the high-hedged narrow lane to which my face was
turned.</p>

<p>On the front seat were two boys, extraordinarily alike,
as I saw when the horse was brought to an extremely sudden
stand-still at my gate. Back to back with these obvious
twins, sat a boy and a girl, the boy an unmistakable
younger brother of the twins, and the girl younger
still.</p>

<p>They were an astoundingly handsome quartette, and the
girl's face was the loveliest I had ever seen.</p>

<p>It is still the loveliest I have ever seen.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to describe her, as it is foolish to
attempt the impossible. I can only say that the face was
typically Anglo-Saxon in its fair loveliness of pale golden
hair, large, long-lashed eyes of corn-flower blue, perfect
complexion and tender mouth, faultless and sweet.</p>

<p>The boy who was driving the restless and spirited horse,
addressed me in a form of words, archaic and unusual.</p>

<p>"Prythee, gentle stranger, seated pensive on thy gate,
and making day hideous with shrill cacophony...."</p>

<p>"Doesn't look coffiny to me," interrupted his twin.</p>

<p>"Nor too blooming gentle," said the boy behind him.</p>

<p>"And I am <i>sure</i> he was making day delightful and wasn't
a bit s'rill, and he isn't a stranger now we've talked to
him," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Good-morning Madam, and gentlemen," said I, stepping
down and raising my cap to the lovely little maiden who had
spoken in my defence.</p>

<p>"Have it your own way, pups," cried the first speaker,
as the three boys gravely and gracefully returned my
salute. "He's not a stranger within our gate, nor on it,
now; he is making day beautiful with uninstrumental and
unearthly music...."</p>

<p>"Do you mean an unearthly row?" asked his twin.</p>

<p>"No, vulgarian; I meant heavenly music. Music such
as ne'er was heard on earth before&mdash;let's hope!...
But what's all this got to do with the dog? The dog may
be dying while we trifle thus&mdash;dying of a broken
heart."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say such dreadful things, Beau," begged the
little girl.</p>

<p>"Nothing dreadful about that," replied the boy called
Beau, manfully checking the horse's obvious desire to bolt.
"Compliment to the dog. D'you mean to suggest that the
callous brute is <i>not</i> by now dying of a broken heart?"</p>

<p>"Spare a father's feelings," requested his twin, and
wiped away a tear. "It's <i>my</i> dog.... And what we want
to know, Sir, if you could be quiet for one second,
is&mdash;er&mdash;have you seen a dog?"</p>

<p>"Often," I replied, trying to enter into the light
inconsequent spirit of this joyous charming band.</p>

<p>"Where?" they inquired simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Oh, Wyoming, Texas, Oregon, Nevada...."</p>

<p>"Nirvana?" inquired the owner of the dog. "Then dogs do
go there. Good."</p>

<p>"California," I continued. "Boston, New York, Paris,
London, Brandon Regis...."</p>

<p>"He's getting 'warm,'" said Beau.</p>

<p>"Brandon Abbas?" prompted his twin.</p>

<p>"I'm not certain," I replied. "I rather think I did,
though...." And here the little girl broke in.</p>

<p>"Oh, do stop talking nonsense, Beau and Digby and
John...."</p>

<p>"Not talking at all," said John, through whose arm the
girl's hand was tucked.</p>

<p>"Well <i>do</i>, then, and say something sensible," was the
feminine reply, and she turned to me.</p>

<p>"We've lost our dog, and he can't have been in <i>all</i>
those funny places you said. Have you seen her here? Will
you help me find her&mdash;for I do love him so?"</p>

<p>"Why, <i>of course</i> I will," I said, and added
impulsively, "I'd do anything you asked me. <i>I'll</i> find him
if he or she is alive."</p>

<p>And the twins on the front seat, promptly assisted by
John, thereupon simultaneously chanted what appeared to be
a family <i>cliché</i>.</p>

<p>"<i>Oh&mdash;isn't&mdash;he&mdash;a&mdash;nice&mdash;boy....
He&mdash;must&mdash;come&mdash;and&mdash;play&mdash;with&mdash;us....
Won't&mdash;Auntie&mdash;be&mdash;pleased....</i>"</p>

<p>"What's the dog like?" I inquired of the one whom they
called Digby. "What breed, if any? And what sex?" as there
seemed to be a variety of opinions on this point.</p>

<p>"Sex? Oh&mdash;er&mdash;she's a bitchelor&mdash;feminine
of bachelor, you know," replied Digby.... "As to what
she's <i>like</i>," he continued, "that's a difficult question
to answer. She's rather like.... No, she isn't.... She
isn't a bit like a giraffe, really.... No.... She's rather
like&mdash;a dog. Yes.... She is.... And she is one of
these new Andorran Oyster-Hounds...."</p>

<p>"Oh, good! That's helpful," I said appreciatively, while
four pairs of bright young eyes summed me up. I was being
weighed, and most earnestly I hoped I should not be found
wanting.</p>

<p>"An idea," I exclaimed. "What name does she answer
to?"</p>

<p>"She never answered <i>me</i>," replied Digby, and turning to
his twin inquired, "Did she ever back-answer you, Beau?"</p>

<p>"Never a cheep out of her," was the reply. "Not a word.
Sulky beggar."</p>

<p>"Not at all," contradicted John, "merely respectful....
Reserved, taciturn chap.... Strong silent dog."</p>

<p>"Well, she always answers <i>me</i>, anyhow," asserted the
little girl warmly. "She always <i>smiles</i>.... He has a most
lovely smile," she added, turning to me.</p>

<p>"Now we're getting on," I declared. "I'm to search for
a dog that is very like a dog and answers with a smile....
Now what is the likeliest way to win her smile? What shall
I call her when I see her?"</p>

<p>"Call her home," said Digby.</p>

<p>"I don't know <i>what</i> you'll call her when you see her,"
said Beau. "Have you a kind nature and a gentle tongue?...
You must tell us later what you <i>did</i> call her when you saw
her.... Especially if you called her it in American."</p>

<p>"Darned gosh-dinged gol-durned dod-gasted smell-hound?"
suggested Digby.</p>

<p>"I've never heard the expressions," I replied, "but I'll
try to remember them if you think them appropriate.... But
to get back to the dog."</p>

<p>"It's what we want to do," replied Digby, "or to get her
back to us. You don't know the state I'm in.... Am I out in
a rash?"</p>

<p>"No. In a dog-cart," said Beau, "and you won't be
in that long, when we start playing chariots.... Well,
good-bye, old chap. Thanks awfully. I hope you haven't
bored us&mdash;I mean we haven't...."</p>

<p>"Stop, stop, Beau," cried the little girl, turning round
and thumping the boy's broad back. "He's going to be a
search-party and we haven't told him what he wants to know,
yet.... I think he's most awfully kind and nice.... And we
ought to help him to ..."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>yes</i>, Beau," said Digby in a tone of deep
reproach, "when he's in such trouble about a dog.... Of
course we must help him. Now let's see," he continued.
"It's got four canine teeth."</p>

<p>"I should think all a dog's teeth are canine," observed
John judicially.</p>

<p>"And five toes on his fore-feet."</p>

<p>"That makes twenty," remarked Beau.</p>

<p>"And four on each hind one.... He wags his tail from
left to right; not right to left.... You get the idea,
don't you? Like a pendulum. Or an Aberdonian his head, when
asked to subscribe."</p>

<p>"But hasn't she a <i>name</i>?" I interrupted.</p>

<p>"A <i>name</i>?" replied Digby. "Now that's an idea. That's
really helpful. Oh, yes, I know she's got a name because I
was at the christening&mdash;but I've clean forgotten most
of it.... What's her name, Beau?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I always call him Jasper Jocelyn Jelkes, but
I think of her as Mrs. Denbigh-Hobbes of The Acacias, Lower
Puffleworth."</p>

<p>"Oh, do stop rotting," begged John, and turning to me
assured me that the dog's name was Simply-Jones, though
generally addressed as Mr. Featherstonehaugh&mdash;whereat
the little girl was moved to climb down on to the step at
the back of the cart, and jump to the ground. Coming round
to where I stood, she seized my arm and proceeded to lead
me down the lane.</p>

<p>"Come away from those sillies, American Boy," she said,
"and I'll just tell you all about it, and you <i>will</i> find
her for me, won't you? She is Digby's dog, but it's me
she loves, and I know she's grieving and sorrowing like
anything, for she has such a nice loving nature and a
good heart. Her name is Joss and she's middle-sized and
middle-aged and sort of middleish altogether&mdash;not
exactly a spaniel nor a terrier nor a hound, but just a
dog, and if you call '<i>Joss, Joss, Joss, Joss, Jossie!</i>'
in a kind sweet voice, rather high, she'll run to you
and smile like anything. You'll know her by her smile.
You <i>will</i> find her, won't you? Our home's at Brandon
Abbas&mdash;Auntie is Lady Brandon."</p>

<p>"If she's alive on this earth, I'll find her," I
said.</p>

<p>"Isobel! <i>Hi!</i> Isobel!! <i>Isobel!!!</i> Come on, if you
want to be Boadicea," came borne on the breezes, and with
a "<i>Thank</i> you, nice American Boy," and a smile that went
straight to my heart&mdash;and also to my head&mdash;Isobel
turned and scampered back.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Later, while searching the world for Joss, I had another
glimpse of this party.</p>

<p>The dog-cart driven at a reckless gallop across a great
lawn-like field, contained a boy and a girl, both wearing
fencing-masks, the girl, armed with a bow and arrow,
returning the fire of two presumed Roman soldiers who, with
javelin and arrow, assailed the chariot, skilfully driven
and controlled by a charioteer.</p>

<p>I was relieved to observe that the horse was apparently
accustomed to these martial exercises, and that the
chariot came round in a graceful curve before reaching the
ditch-and-hedge at the end of the field. </p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p> Being a strictly truthful person, I cannot say that
I found Jasper Jocelyn Jelkes, <i>alias</i> Joss, for it was
really she who found me. What her business may have been,
I do not know, but she was visiting at High Gables, my
grandmother's house, when I returned for lunch.</p>

<p>As I emerged from the shadows of the avenue, I beheld
a very nondescript dog sunning herself on the lowest of
the white steps of the porch, and smiling, most positively
smiling, with extreme fatuity and foolishness, at my
Grandmother's tiny Pekinese, a microscopic by-product
of the dog-industry, which found no favour in my sight.
Lifting up my voice to the level of the hope that rose in
my heart, I invoked the smiling caller, in the very tones
and accent in which I had been instructed, and in the most
mellifluous and wooing way at my command. The excellent
Joss, for such, beyond peradventure of a doubt, her conduct
proved her to be, lolloped straightway to my feet and
sitting on end, smiled and smiled and was not a villain, I
felt sure.</p>

<p>"Joss!" I cried, patting that smiling head. "<i>Dulce
ridentem Lalagem amabo</i>; grinning idiot; Minnehaha,
Laughing Water; I'm <i>very</i> pleased to meet you.... You
shall lead me, gentle Jossie, like a blind man's dog,
straight to Brandon Abbas, to the house of Aunty, to those
delightful boys and to&mdash;Isobel. Are you a bit of a
card, Jossie? For my visiting-card you shall be...."</p>

<p>Oh, to be seventeen again! Seventeen, on a most
glorious English spring day, the day on which you have
first encountered the very loveliest thing in all the
world&mdash;that is to remain, for ever, the very loveliest
thing in all your world. </p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="first">
After lunch, on that day of days, with Hail Smiling
Joss as my sponsor, excuse, and loud note of introduction,
I "proceeded," as they say in the British Navy, to the
great house of Brandon Abbas, after so feasting the
excellent dog that it seemed highly probable she would
again lose herself in the direction of High Gables.</p>

<p>Up a few miles of avenue of Norman oaks I tramped, from
the Lodge at the gates guarded by heraldic beasts well
known to students of Unnatural History&mdash;the Returning
Wanderer straining at the leash and obviously striving
to compose her features to a mask of becoming gravity,
tempered by gladness while chastened by shame.</p>

<p>Arrived at a large square of mossy gravel surrounded by
a dense shrubbery, I beheld a great porch and an open door
through which I had, in passing, a glimpse of a panelled
hall, gleaming floor, and suits of armour. A passing
glimpse, because it was clearly obvious that Joss intended
me to pass, and my will was not brought into conflict with
hers, as I heard shouts and peals of laughter from the band
of whom I was in search.</p>

<p>Guided by the now excited dog, I crossed a rose-garden
and, by a path through some great old elms and beeches,
reached an open space of turf which was a view-point
overlooking half the county.</p>

<p>As we burst from the gloom of the wood into the
sunshine, a hubbub arose; the four, now augmented by
several others, converged upon me, and, with a shriek of
joy, as she sped forward ahead of the rest, the little girl
literally flung herself upon me, threw her arms about my
neck, and kissed me warmly. Truth compels me to add that
she promptly did precisely the same to the errant Joss,
who instantly abandoning her expression, pose, and air of
a Misunderstood-but-Hopeful-Dog, stood upon her hind legs,
her paws against her mistress, wagged her tail and her
tongue, and smiled and smiled to the point of laughter.</p>

<p>"Oh, Stout Fella!" cried Beau. "Splendid! Good
scout!"</p>

<p>"Put it right there, Mr. Daniel Boone&mdash;or are you
Kit Carson? Or Buffalo Bill? Or the Pathfinder?... Anyhow,
you're the Dogfinder," said Digby, extending his hand, and
wringing mine powerfully.... "A father's thanks ... The
Prodigal Dog ... Good mind to <i>kill</i> the fat-headed calf!"
and seizing the dog in his arms, he rolled upon the ground
in apparently terrific combat with the savage beast, who,
with horrid growls and furious barks, worried the throat of
her fiercely-stabbing antagonist, and bloodlessly bit him
with all her canine teeth.</p>

<p>"In the end, I die, having saved all your lives from a
mad dog, and so find a hero's grave," announced Digby....
"The dog was born mad," he added, and lay motionless, while
the Andorran Oyster-Hound surveyed her tooth-work, wagged
her tail joyously, and seated herself upon the chest of her
victim.</p>

<p>The youngest brother, meanwhile, having slipped his hand
inside my arm, while he critically watched the progress
of the fight, stood by my side as I waited&mdash;holding
the grubby little paw which Isobel had thrust into my
hand&mdash;and feeling unreasoningly and unreasonably
happy.</p>

<p>"I say," said the boy, "you ought to join the Band. Will
you? Would you like to?"</p>

<p>"Oh <i>yes</i>," chimed in Isobel. "<i>Do</i>, American Boy....
Have you ever been tortured by Indians, or been the Victim
of a Cruel Fate, like Mazeppa? Do you think we might roast
you at the stake?... We've all got mustangs, and Joss is
quite a good wolf or coyote. She's being a wolf now, and
she's not mad at all&mdash;not even half-witted."</p>

<p>"Not nearly half," agreed Digby, arising. "Er&mdash;this
is&mdash;er&mdash;the Captain&mdash;Michael Geste,
Captain of the Band. I am Digby Geste, Lieutenant of the
Band. The object on your right hand is John Geste, or
Very Small Geste, or Not-Much-of the Band. The female
prisoner is Isobel Rivers, the Music of the Band. The
beautiful woman enthroned yonder is Claudia, Queen of
the Band; and the gentleman at present struck dumb by
toffee-on-the-jaw, is Augustus Brandon, and can't be
helped. I may add that, as you doubtless suppose, he is
not such a fool as he looks. How could he be?... The
small fat boy and girl on the pony are twins, Marmaduke
and&mdash;er&mdash;Marmaduchess. Marmaduke's step-mother,
who eats vinegar with a fishhook three times a day, says
he is Wholly Bad. We call him the Wholly of Whollies.
Marmaduchess is of course the Roly of Polies.... These camp
followers&mdash;scampfollowers&mdash;er&mdash;no, that
won't do, as they follow the Captain, are Honorary Members
of the Band. In view of your great services, I have the
pleasure ..."</p>

<p>"You'll have the pleasure of bread-and-water and six of
the best, if you don't take a holiday," interrupted the
Captain of the Band, and proceeded most warmly to invite me
to become an Honorary Member of "Beau Geste's Band," and
to take part in all its doings, for so long as the country
was enriched by my presence, and whenever my inclinations
prompted me so to do.</p>

<p>Gratefully accepting the Band's hospitality, I was
initiated and enrolled, and quickly appointed stage-manager
of its activities in its Western American manifestations,
and became its authority upon the dark ways of Red Indians,
Bad Men, Buffalo Bills, Cow-boys, Deadwood Dicks, and other
desperadoes.</p>

<p>I won my spurs (but did not wear them) by finding myself
able to catch, mount, and ride a horse that was loose in
the paddock. A horse that had never been ridden before and
apparently intended never to be ridden again....</p>

<p>After a most delightful tea with these extraordinarily
charming young people, I walked back to High Gables feeling
happier, I think, than I had ever felt in my life. It was
a rather wonderful thing to me, a lonely stranger in a
strange land&mdash;for there was nobody but my Grandmother
and her servants at High Gables&mdash;suddenly to find
myself a member of so attractive a society, a family so
friendly, so welcoming, so uncritically hospitable that,
almost on sight, they had admitted me to membership
of their Band, with all the privileges attaching
thereto....</p>

<p>But as I lay awake in bed that night, the picture most
vividly before me was the beautiful face of the darling
child who had given me that sweet spontaneous kiss of
gratitude and innocence.</p>

<p>It surely was the nicest thing that had ever happened to
me. </p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p> I shall be believed when I state that I missed few
opportunities of accepting the warm invitation to "come
again soon" which invariably accompanied the farewells at
the end of each of my visits to Brandon Abbas. The more I
saw of the three Gestes, the better I liked them, and I
knew that I could never see too much, nor indeed enough,
of Isobel Rivers&mdash;that lovely little fairy; charming
and delightful child; ineffably sweet, and absorbingly
interesting, little friend....</p>

<p>Of the boys, I liked John best; for, in addition to
all the attributes which he possessed in common with his
brilliant brothers, he was, to me, slightly pathetic in his
dog-like devotion to the twins, who ruled him with a rod of
iron, chastened and chastised him for the good of his soul,
kept him in subjection, and loved him utterly. In return
for their unwavering and undemonstrated love, he gave them
worship. They would have died for him, and he would have
died under torture for them.</p>

<p>Yet, at the same time, I like Beau enormously; for his
splendour&mdash;and it was nothing less&mdash;of mind, body
and soul; his unselfish sweetness and gentleness, and his
extraordinary "niceness" to everybody, including myself.
Even when he had occasion to punish a member of his Band,
it appeared to me that the victim of his arbitrary justice
rather enjoyed the honour of being singled out, even for
admonition and the laying on of hands....</p>

<p>But then, again, I liked Digby as much; for his
unfailing mirth and happiness. He was a walking chuckle,
and those who walked through life with him chuckled too.
He was merriment personified; his day was a smile; and
if he fell on his head from the top of a tree, the first
use he made of his recovered breath was to laugh at the
extraordinarily amusing funniness of Digby Geste's falling
thirty feet and nearly breaking his neck.... He was the
most genuinely and spontaneously cheerful person I ever
met, and somehow one always laughed when Digby began to
laugh, without waiting for the joke.</p>

<p>Isobel was their pet, their fairy, their mascot,
their dear perfect play-mate; and Claudia was
their Queen&mdash;"Queen Claudia, of Beau Geste's
Band"&mdash;held in the highest honour and esteem. They
loved and obeyed Claudia; but they petted and adored
Isobel.</p>

<p>I suppose Claudia was of an immaculately flawless
beauty, charm, and grace of form and face, even as a young
girl&mdash;but personally I never liked her. There was a
slight hardness, a self-consciousness and an element of
selfishness in her character, that were evident&mdash;to me
at any rate, though not, I think, to the others. Certainly
not to Michael Geste, for she was obviously his <i>beau
idéal</i> of girlhood, and he, her self-constituted paladin
and knight-errant. When they played "tournaments" she was
always the Queen of Beauty, and he her Champion, ready,
willing and able, to dispose of all who disputed his (or
her) claim that she was the loveliest damsel in all the
world....</p>

<p>Nor could I like Lady Brandon, fascinating as she was
to most. She was kind, gracious and hospitable to me, and
I was grateful&mdash;but <i>like</i> her I could not. She was
an absolute re-incarnation of "Good" Queen Bess, and I do
not think any living woman could have better impersonated
Queen Elizabeth than she, whether on the stage or off.
Although beautiful in her way, she was astoundingly like
the portraits of that great unscrupulous Queen, and, in my
belief, she resembled her in character. She was imperious,
clever, hard, "managing" and capable. She was very queenly
in appearance and style, given to the cherishing of
favourites&mdash;Michael and Claudia especially&mdash;and
extremely jealous. She was a woman of strong character and
could be both ruthless and unscrupulous. At least, that is
the impression I formed of Lady Brandon&mdash;and I am very
intuitive, as well as being a student of physiognomy, and
possessed of a distinct gift for reading character.</p>

<p>No, I disliked Lady Brandon and I distrusted
her&mdash;and I thought that she and Claudia were not
unlike in character.... I was very intrigued when my
Grandmother dryly remarked, "Henry VIII is, I believe the
'<i>Rex</i>' of Brandon '<i>Regis</i>'" when, in reply to a question
of hers anent Lady Brandon, I had observed, "She reminds me
of Queen Elizabeth...."</p>

<p>She resembled the Queen, too, in her power of inspiring
great love in men, a noble love, worthy of a nobler
object....</p>

<p>On one of my visits to the Band, I was scolded for my
absence of several days&mdash;I had been to London, on
business of my Father's&mdash;and told that I had missed
the chance of a lifetime, a chance of seeing and hearing a
veritable Hero of Romance, a French officer of Spahis, son
of a senior school friend of Lady Brandon's, who had been
week-ending at Brandon Abbas, and who had for ever endeared
himself to the children, by his realistic and true tales
of Desert warfare, and of adventures in mysterious and
romantic Morocco.</p>

<p>Promptly we ceased to be Red Indians, Knights of
the Round Table, Crusaders, Ancient Britons, Big Game
Hunters, or anything else but Spahis and Arabs, and
the three Gestes and I spent a portion of our lives in
charging&mdash;mounted on two ponies, a donkey and a
carriage-horse&mdash;a <i>douar</i> of gorse-bushes stoutly
defended by a garrison of Arabs clad in towels, sheets and
night-shirts and armed with pea-shooters, bows and arrows,
lances, swords and spears, toy rifles and pistols which
made more sound than sorrow....</p>

<p>The Band certainly "lived dangerously," but accidents
were few and slight, and the absolute freedom permitted to
the children, as soon as morning lessons with the Chaplain
were finished, was really not abused. Being trusted, they
were trustworthy, and the Captain led the Band not into
temptation irresistible, nor into more than right and
reasonable danger.</p>

<p>This chaplain was a puzzle to me. I felt certain he
was essentially good, honourable and well-meaning; but he
struck me, in my youthful intolerance, as being too weak
and feeble in character to be worthy of the name of man.
Certainly he was well-placed in the skirted cassock that he
wore; and that, together with his sweet and gentle face and
manner, seemed to put him in a class apart&mdash;neither
man nor woman, just sexless priest. He loved the children
devotedly&mdash;and was more like a mother than a father to
them. Lady Brandon, he obviously adored. He too, was one
of this queenly and imperious woman's favourites, and her
handsome face would soften to a great gentleness when she
walked and talked with him upon the terrace.</p>

<p>It was an extraordinarily interesting household, and
when the time came for me to return home and prepare to go
to Harvard, I was extremely sorry.</p>

<p>It was with a slight lump in my throat that I spent my
last afternoon with the Band, and with a miserable turmoil
in my heart that I said good-bye to them. They, too, seemed
genuinely sorry that I was going, and seriously considered
John's proposal that they should accompany me <i>en masse</i>,
at least as far as Wyoming, where they might remain and
adopt the profession of cow-puncher.</p>

<p>I think I walked back to High Gables that afternoon as
quickly as I had ever walked in my life, for I was trying
to walk away from myself, from my misery, from the sense of
utter loss and desolation.</p>

<p>I was astounded at myself.... Why was I feeling this
way? What had happened to me? I had not felt so wretched,
so bereaved, so filled with a sense of loss and loneliness,
since my Mother died.... I was like a man who, stricken
with some sudden mortal pain, strives to account for it,
and cannot do so....</p>

<p>Isobel had put her arms round my neck and kissed me
good-bye.</p>

<p>"You <i>will</i> come back soon, nice American Boy?" she had
said. And I had positively been unable to answer anything
at all. I could only laugh and nod my head in assent.</p>

<p>That night, being absolutely unable to sleep, I rose
from my bed, dressed, and, creeping quietly from the house,
walked to Brandon Abbas to see, as I told myself, how that
ancient pile looked by the light of the full moon....</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Next day I began my journey, suffering horribly
from home-sickness&mdash;sickness for the home of my
heart&mdash;Brandon Abbas. Each mile that I was carried,
by train and ship and train again, from that lovely
place, increased my misery, and when at length I reached
my Father's ranch, I had hard work to hide it from my
sister Mary, that dear determined and forceful young
woman. My Father&mdash;my hard, overbearing, autocratic
Father&mdash;was not given to noticing whether others were
wretched or not, and my kid sister, Janey, was too young.
Noel, the eldest of our family, was still "missing," and
my Father professed neither to know nor to care where he
was....</p>

<p>However, I soon began to enjoy my sweet unhappiness, and
I lived on horseback until the day came when I must go East
to college, and leave this free and glorious open-air life
behind me.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I went willingly enough, for I
loved books, and desired above all things to become a fine
scholar.... I considered "My mind to me a kingdom is," to
be a grand saying if one could say it (to oneself only, of
course) with real truth.... I could never understand Noel's
flat refusal to study anything but horses, Nature, and the
lore of the Indian and the Plainsman; nor his oft-expressed
view that education is not of books but of life. Nothing,
according to Noel, could educate one for life except life
itself; and books and schooling could but educate one for
more schooling and books, the examination-hall, and the
realms of false values. And yet he read the books that he
liked, my wonderful brother Noel&mdash;but to school and
college he would not go, and thither not even my dynamic
and violent Father could drive him.</p>

<p>"Honour thy father and thy mother" ... We could not do
otherwise than honour Mother, as well as love her almost to
the point of adoration.</p>

<p>What shall I say of my terrible Father? We did honour
him. We respected him and most certainly we obeyed
him&mdash;all of us but Noel, that is. Noel ceased to obey
him as soon as he was big and old enough to stand up for
Mother.</p>

<p>His refusal to go to school and college was, I believe,
due to his wish, that he might be near her and take
her part. Nor did he leave home until the day when he
found that in his wrath he had pulled his gun on Dad,
and realized that he had to choose between that sort of
thing&mdash;and departure.</p>

<p>He departed, and returned after a quarter of a century
in such wise as I shall relate.</p>

<p>My Father was not a bad man. He was a very "good"
one. He was not cruel, vicious, nor vindictive; but he
was a terror and a tyrant. He crushed his wife and broke
her spirit, and he turned his children into rebels, or
terrified "suggestibles."</p>

<p>Noel and Mary were rebels. Janey and I were cowed and
terrified.</p>

<p>Of all the marvellous deeds for which, as a child, I
worshipped Noel, his defiance of my Father, was to me by
far the most wonderful.</p>

<p>At different times, my Father in his austerity and
tenacity reminded me of Abraham Lincoln; in his rugged and
ferocious "piety," of the prophet Elijah, John Wesley,
Brigham Young, and John Knox. There was something in him,
too, of Mr. Gladstone, of Theodore Roosevelt, and a good
deal of William Jennings Bryan at his most oratorical, most
narrow, and most dogmatic.</p>

<p>And there was undoubtedly something in him of King David
of Jerusalem. Yes, most undoubtedly there were many points
of strong resemblance between my Father and that brave,
strong, wily man, that pious and passionate king.</p>

<p>And a king, in his own wide realm, my father was,
brooking scarcely a suggestion, much less a contradiction,
from any man&mdash;a king terribly and unhappily aware
of the state of sin in which lived all his subjects,
especially those of his own household.</p>

<p>He believed that the Bible had been dictated&mdash;in
English of course&mdash;by God, and that to take it other
than literally was damnation and death. He almost flogged
Noel <i>to</i> death when, at the age of sixteen or so, the
latter impiously dared to wonder how Noah gathered in both
the polar bears <i>and</i> the kangaroos, for his menagerie, and
how he built the fifty-thousand-ton liner necessary for the
accommodation of all the animals and their food.</p>

<p>This was after Father's return from a trip to Europe to
buy a twenty-thousand-dollar pedigree prize Hereford bull,
and the finest pure-bred Arab stallion that money could
purchase.</p>

<p>During his absence, Noel had caught out the overseer, a
pious-seeming hypocritical rascal, in whom Father firmly
believed; had thrashed him, and run him off the Ranch.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Noel had saved Father a great deal of money
and unmasked an unmitigated rascal, and for this, I verily
believe, Father hated him the more, and never forgave
him.</p>

<p>Yes, Father certainly spoilt Noel's life and made him
the wanderer that he became.</p>

<p>To this day, when I have a nightmare, and I have a
good many, it is generally of a terrible conflict with
my Father, and I awake sweating and trembling with
indignation, rage and horror.</p>

<p>For, in the dream, he always rushes at me, bawling
invective, his face inflamed with rage, and, seizing me
by the throat he raises his cutting-whip to thrash the
wickedness out of me, as he so often did in reality. And,
to my horror, I find myself clenching my fist to smash that
mask of mad ferocity, and then I realize that I am about
to strike my own Father, in my indignation that I, a grown
man, should be treated thus.</p>

<p>It sounds nothing, but it is a <i>dreadful</i> dream.</p>

<p>"Honour thy father" ... I believe that Mother worshipped
him and feared him, and I believe that I, subconsciously,
hated him most bitterly, while I consciously respected and
feared him.</p>

<p>To the world, our little western world, he was a great
man&mdash;a man of his word, a strong man, a dangerous man
to cross, a good friend and a bad enemy.</p>

<p>One of Mary's <i>obiter dicta</i> on the subject of Father
sheds a great light on his strong and complex character.</p>

<p>"Father has never done wrong in his life," said she,
"for whatever Father does is right&mdash;in the sight of
Father."</p>

<p>Mary inherited much of Father's strength and force of
will, as well as much of Mother's attractiveness.</p>

<p>She was a girl of character, and what she set her heart
on, she got. If Father's strength were that of granite,
iron and adamant, hers was the strength of tempered steel,
for she was pliant and knew when to bend that she might not
break. She managed Father and refused to be crushed. Where
Noel openly defied and fought him, she secretly defied and
out-manoeuvred him.</p>

<p>Father certainly loved her&mdash;as men do their
daughters&mdash;and I think Mary loved him, up to a point.
</p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p> Much as I enjoyed everything, from books to base-ball,
at glorious Harvard, I found myself obsessed with the
desire to visit England again. Nor was it wholly due to
a yearning to see the fine face of my kindly-caustic
Grandmother Hankinson once more. Greatly I yearned to
revisit Brandon Regis at the earliest opportunity&mdash;for
Brandon Regis is but a pleasant walk from Brandon Abbas.</p>

<p>I wanted to see the Geste boys again&mdash;and I
wanted to see Isobel.... That's the plain fact of the
matter&mdash;I wanted to see Isobel. Every single separate
day of my life I wanted to see her.</p>

<p>I do not say that, during my Harvard years, I mooned
about in a hopeless state of calf-love, a ridiculous young
sentimentalist, nor that her lovely little face came ever
and ever between me and the printed page, and was always in
my mind, sleeping and waking, playing and working&mdash;but
I certainly admit that I thought of her regularly....</p>

<p>It was my practice nightly, on laying my head on the
pillow, to project my mind to the Park of Brandon Abbas,
and to enter into a lovely secret kingdom of my own, and
there to dwell, happy, remote, and in lovely peace, until I
fell asleep.</p>

<p>This kingdom was shared by Isobel, and we
two&mdash;devoted friends&mdash;did delightful things
together; had wonderful talks; explored a world of utter
beauty; and walked hand-in-hand in a fairyland of joy and
fun and laughter....</p>

<p>I am not sure but that this was my real life, at that
time; this and the dreams that followed almost invariably,
when I fell asleep. Certainly, it was so real that I looked
forward to it each day, and if not consciously doing so,
was always half-aware and semi-conscious of something
delightful that was in store for me, something good and
sweet and precious, something "nice" that was coming to
me. And when I analysed this feeling of joyous promise I
found that it was my soul's anticipation of its visit to
the Kingdom of Enchantment where Isobel would meet me and
we would walk and talk and laugh together in our Paradise
Unlost.</p>

<p>When a sleep-dream followed the consciously induced
day-dream, I always awoke from it to minutes of ineffable
happiness, a happiness experienced at no other time and
in no other way.... I felt <i>good</i>.... And I realized how
singularly blessed was Otis H. Vanbrugh, above other men.
Nor did the corollary escape me&mdash;how incumbent it
was upon me to keep myself fit to enter our lovely secret
kingdom, and worthy to meet Isobel there.</p>

<p>I do not think that what are supposed to be the
inevitable and terrible temptations of wealthy young men
at College, existed for me at all. Late hours would have
been hours that made me late for the Secret Garden; the
odour of wine was not one that would mingle favourably
with that of the dewy roses there; nor could one who was
daily privileged to commune with Isobel, find the faintest
possible charm or attraction in the halls of the Paphian
dames.... So I filled my days with work, read hard and
played hard, lived dangerously when living in the West,
pursued with ardour there the study of International Law
and of the ways of the mountain lion and of the grizzly
bear, and earned the warm approval of my brave and hardy
sister, Mary....</p>

<p>And imagine if you can, the frame of mind in which, at
the end of my College days, I sailed for Europe&mdash;on a
visit to a life-long friend of my Father's, who was then
our Ambassador to France&mdash;and incidentally to visit my
Grandmother at Brandon Regia....</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>As I stepped from the Southampton-London boat-train
at Waterloo Terminus, another train was in the act of
departure from the opposite side of the same platform, and
gliding forward with slowly increasing speed. At a window,
waving a handkerchief to three young men, was a girl, and,
with a queer constriction of the heart, a rush of blood
to the head, and a slight trembling of the whole body, I
realized that the girl was Isobel Rivers&mdash;the child
Isobel, grown up to most lovely girlhood ... wonderfully
the same and yet different.... She had put her hair
up....</p>

<p>In the baggage-car of my own train were my cabin-trunks
and portmanteaux. In the hands of a porter were already
my suit-case and grip. Without ceremony, I rushed across
that broad platform, threading my way through the crowd
like a football-forward in a hurry. As I reached the now
quickly-moving train, seized a door-handle and ran swiftly
while I turned it, an official of some sort made a grab
at me and shouted, "Stand back! You can't get in there,
sir," in fiercely indignant remonstrance, not so much at my
daring to break my neck as at my daring to break a railway
bye-law.</p>

<p>"Hi! You can't get in there," he roared again.</p>

<p>"Watch me," I replied, eluding him, and swung myself on
to the foot-board as the door came open.... "I won't hurt
your train," I shouted back, as he was left gesticulating
in sorrow and in anger, at the end of the platform.</p>

<p>In the compartment that I then entered, were three
Englishmen and an Englishwoman. Not one of them looked up
as I took my seat, nor spoke to me nor to each other during
the long hours of non-stop run that ensued....</p>

<p>Wonderful people, the English!...</p>

<p>And there I sat in that antediluvian non-corridor car
through those long hours, my baggage abandoned, my hotel
reservation unclaimed, my destination unknown; but with
the knowledge that Isobel Rivers and I were in the same
train and that I should speak to her just as soon as that
prehistoric Flying Dutchman, or Roaring Rocket, reached its
destination or first stopping-place.</p>

<p>In spite of cold, hunger, disorientation, and a certain
slight anxiety as to the ultimate fate of my baggage, those
were, I verily believe, among the happiest hours of my
life; and when the train slowed down&mdash;it must have
slowed down, I suppose, though no change of speed was to me
perceptible&mdash;to decant its phlegmatic inhabitants at
Exeter, I, the last man into that train, was certainly the
first man out. </p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p> Isobel, I am most perfectly sure, was really
unfeignedly glad to see me, and Lady Brandon very kindly
pretended to be. I knew that Isobel was glad because, as
she recognized me, that wonderful sparkle&mdash;a kind of
dancing light, that indescribable lighting-up, as though
with an internal illumination, that always signalized and
beautified her joy&mdash;came into her eyes. One reads of
people dancing with pleasure and jumping for joy. Isobel
did not do these things, but her eyes did, and one could
always tell when a gift or a jest or any happening had
given her real pleasure, by watching her eyes.</p>

<p>I had often heard John Geste say "<i>That'll</i> make
Isobel's eyes shine" when there was something amusing to
tell her, or some piece of good news; and I thought to
myself that surely no-one could conceive a more glorious
and wonderful way of spending his life than in bringing
this beautiful light to Isobel's eyes.</p>

<p>Imagine, if you can, the joy that it gave me to realize
that I had been able to do it now.</p>

<p>"Why," she said as I approached and raised my hat, "the
nice American boy!... Oh, how lovely!... The boys <i>will</i>
be sorry," and she gave me both her hands in the most
delightful and friendly manner.</p>

<p>Lady Brandon gave me both fingers in a less spontaneous
and friendly manner that was nevertheless quite pleasant,
and&mdash;God bless her&mdash;invited me to share their
compartment in the train to Brandon Abbas and their
carriage which would meet them there. She displayed none of
the surprise that she must certainly have felt on learning
that there was no luggage problem, as I had no luggage.
Beneath her half-kindly, half-satirical gaze, I did my best
to conceal the fact that, on catching sight of Isobel, I
had abandoned everything but hope, and dashed from one
train to the other.</p>

<p>I do not know whether selected prophets, such as Elijah,
ever found ecstatic joy in their rides in fiery chariots
and similar celestial vehicles, but I do know that my
short ride by train and carriage with Isobel, was to me
the highest summit of ecstatic joy&mdash;a pure happiness
utterly indescribable and incommunicable&mdash;the
higher, the greater, and the lovelier for its purity. And
it was not until I was deposited at High Gables after
leaving Isobel and Lady Brandon at Brandon Abbas, that my
soaring spirit came down to earth, and, it having come
to earth, I was faced with the problem of explaining my
unheralded arrival and the absence of further provision
than a walking-stick and one glove. Also, alas, with the
realization that I should not see Isobel again, as she and
Lady Brandon were going to Wales on the morrow, and, later
on, to Scotland on a round of visits. They had been staying
in London with the boys, who were now setting off for a
walking-tour in Normandy.</p>

<p>However, <i>I had seen Isobel</i> and received
confirmation&mdash;if confirmation were needed&mdash;of the
fact that not only was she the most marvellous thing in all
the world, but that everything else in the world would be
as nothing in the balance against her.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>I have mentioned this trivial and foolish little
incident&mdash;which ended next day with my return to
London and the pursuit of my baggage&mdash;because it
was on this night, as I lay awake, that there came to me
the great, the very greatest, idea of my life&mdash;the
idea that I might conceivably, with the help of God and
every nerve and fibre of my being, some day, somehow,
contrive to make myself worthy to love Isobel and
then&mdash;incredibly&mdash;to be loved by Isobel, and
actually to devote my life to doing that of which I had
thought when her eyes sparkled and shone at seeing me.</p>

<p>It is curious and true that the idea had never occurred
to me before, and I had never envisaged the possibility
of such a thing as not only loving her, but being loved
by her in return, and of actually walking hand in hand
along the path of life in the spirit of sweet and lovely
companionship, as we did nightly in our Dream Garden....
And there, I remember, a little chill fell upon my heart
and checked my fond imaginings, as it occurred to me for
the first time that the Dream Garden was a creation of
my dreams alone, and not of Isobel's as well. There we
met and talked and walked and were dear friends, with a
reality as great as that of anything in my real and waking
life&mdash;but of course, it was only <i>my</i> dream, and the
real Isobel knew nothing of the Dream Garden.</p>

<p>But did she know nothing? Why should I assume that?</p>

<p>Suppose&mdash;only suppose&mdash;that she dreamed it,
too! Suppose Isobel had this curious and wonderful double
life, as I had, and met me in her dreams precisely as I
met her, night by night! Absurd, of course, but much too
lovely an idea to discard with even pretended contempt. I
would ask her the very next time I saw her. How unutterably
wonderful if she could tell me that it was so!...
Moreover, if it <i>were</i> so, it would mean <i>that she loved
me</i>&mdash;and, at this, even I laughed at my own folly.
Still I would ask her the very next time we met....</p>

<p>But the next time we met, I asked her something else.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="first">
I suppose that among the very happiest days of my
whole life were those I spent on my next journey from New
York to Southampton and Brandon Regis. I must have seemed
insufferably joyous and pleased with myself. When not
actually whistling or singing with my mouth, I was doing
it in my heart. I loved everybody. What is less certain is
whether everybody loved me. I loved the glorious sunshine,
the perfect sea, the splendid ship, the jolly food, the
passengers, every one of them, the young, the old, the
merry, the grumpy, the active, the lazy, the selfish, the
unselfish.... If all the world loves a lover, surely a
lover loves all the world ... the great grand glorious
world that lies at his exalted feet.... The world that
contains, and exists to contain, the one and only woman in
the world....</p>

<p>I loved the stars, the moon, the marvellous night-sky,
the floor of Heaven pierced with millions of little holes
through which shone rays of the celestial light&mdash;and I
sat late and alone, gazing, thinking, dreaming, longing.</p>

<p>I loved the dawn, and late as I may have sat upon the
boat-deck at night, I was there again to see the East grow
grey and pink and golden, there to welcome and to greet the
sun that ushered in one more milestone day upon the brief
and lovely road that led to Brandon Abbas and to Isobel.</p>

<p>Brandon Abbas and Isobel!... One day, when a poor rich
youth whom I comprehended in my universal love&mdash;in
spite of his pimples, poor jokes, unpleasing ways and
unacceptable views&mdash;asked me if I were going to
Paris, and I replied, "No&mdash;to Brandon Abbas," and
he, astonished, inquired where that might be, and I
answered:</p>

<p>"Next door to Paradise," he rightly concluded that I was
out of my mind or else drunk. Doubly right was he, for I
was beside myself with joy and drunk with happiness.</p>

<p>Yes; I loved all things; I loved all men; and greatly I
loved God.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>At Southampton I let the boat-train go upon its foolish
way to London, and at the terminus hotel of the South
Western Railway I awaited the far far better one that
meanders across the green and pleasant land of England to
the little junction where one may get one better still,
one that proceeds thence to Exeter where waits the best
of all&mdash;the final and finest train in the wide
world&mdash;that carries its blest occupants to Brandon
Abbas.</p>

<p>I was not sitting in a train made with mortal hands,
but in a chariot of fire that was carrying me, ecstatic
and uplifted, to the heaven of my dreams, my night-and-day
dreams of many years.</p>

<p>From the station I drove, in what to the dull eye of
the ordinary beholder was a musty, mouldy carriage, drawn
by a moth-eaten and dilapidated parody of a horse, to
High Gables, and was welcomed with the apparently caustic
kindness and grim friendliness with which my wonderful old
Grandmother Hankinson hid her really tender and loving
nature.</p>

<p>And next day I walked over to Brandon Abbas.</p>

<p>I remember trying, on the way, to recollect some lines
I fancied I had read. Were they written by the Marquis
of Montrose or had Queen Elizabeth scratched them with a
diamond on a window-pane for the encouragement of some
young adorer? Was it, "<i>He either fears his fate too much,
Or his deserts are small, Who dares not put it to the
touch, To win or lose it all.</i>"...? Something like that
anyhow, and probably written by Montrose.</p>

<p>Well, my deserts were small enough, and at times I
feared my fate, but I was certainly going to put it to
the touch before I went away, if I stayed for a year or a
life-time.</p>

<p>I was going to tell Isobel that I loved her&mdash;had
loved her unceasingly and increasingly, from the moment
that I had seen her, a lovely child sitting in a dog-cart,
and much concerned about a dog.</p>

<p>True&mdash;I was utterly and wholly unworthy of her, but
so was everybody else. I had nothing to recommend me but an
absolutely perfect and unquenchable love&mdash;but I was
not ineligible from the point of view of such a person as
Lady Brandon, for example. I was a foreigner, an American,
but I had roots in this very soil, through my Mother. I
was obscure and unknown, but that could very quickly be
put right if I became Isobel's husband. That alone would
be a great distinction, but I would undertake to add to
it, and to promise that Isobel's husband should one day be
the American Ambassador to St. James's, to Paris, to St.
Petersburg&mdash;any old where she liked.... President of
the United States of America, if she set her heart on his
being that.... I was very far from being poor, and should
not be far from being very rich, someday.</p>

<p>Thirty-cent things of that sort would be quite germane
and material in the eyes of Queen Elizabethan Lady Brandon.
To my mind, the only really relevant thing was that I loved
Isobel to the point of worship and adoration, and that
this love of mine had not only stood the test of time, but
had gained from Time himself&mdash;for the wine of love
had mellowed and matured, grown better, richer, sweeter,
nobler, year by year....</p>

<p>Poor boy!...</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>I turned in at the Lodge gates, and walked up the long
drive of which I knew every Norman tree.</p>

<p>Good old Burdon, the perfect butler, fine flower of
English retainerhood, was in the hall as I appeared in the
porch, and greeted me in the perfect manner of the perfect
servant, friendly, welcoming, respectful.</p>

<p>But Her Ladyship was Not at Home....</p>

<p>Miss Claudia was Not at Home....</p>

<p>Miss Isobel was Not at Home....</p>

<p>Mr. Michael, Mr. Digby, and Mr. John were Away from
Home....</p>

<p>Nothing for it but to leave my cards and depart, more
than a little dashed and damped.</p>

<p>I walked down the drive less buoyantly than I had walked
up it. It actually had not entered my silly head that one
could go to Brandon Abbas and not find Isobel there....
The sunshine was not so bright nor the sky so blue, and
what had been the sweet singing of the birds, was just a
noise....</p>

<p>And as I rounded a turn in the drive, my heart rounded
and turned and drove, for a girl was riding toward me, a
little girl on a big horse. The loveliest, dearest, kindest
girl in all the wide world....</p>

<p>My heart turned right-side-up, pulled itself together,
and let me get my breath again.... <i>Isobel</i>....</p>

<p>The sun shone gloriously bright and warm, the sky was a
deep Italian blue, the English song-birds were birds from
Paradise&mdash;and Isobel held out a gloved hand which
I took and pressed to my lips as she smiled sweetly and
kindly and said:</p>

<p>"Why! It's our nice American Boy come back! I <i>am</i>
so glad ... Otis ..." and then I knew that something
was wrong. Her voice was different; older. Her face was
different; older. She was unhappy....</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Isobel?" I asked, still holding her
little hand as she bent toward me from her big horse.</p>

<p>"Oh ... Otis.... How did you know?... <i>John has
gone</i>.... The boys have gone away...."</p>

<p>Her lip trembled and there was a suspicion of moisture
in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Can I help?... <i>Let</i> me help you, Isobel," I begged.</p>

<p>"There's nothing you can do&mdash;thank you so much,"
she said. "It's nice of you.... I am so glad to see you
again, Otis.... I have been so wretched. There is no-one I
can talk to, about it...."</p>

<p>"There is," I said. "There's me," and I think that
moment marked the absolute top-most pinnacle of happiness
that I have ever known, for Isobel pressed my hand hard.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you a great secret," she said, and smiled
so sweetly through the unshed tears that I could scarcely
forbear to reach up and lift her from her horse, lift her
into my arms, my heart, and my life.</p>

<p>"I'll tell <i>you</i>, Otis.... Keep it a secret though," she
added. And then Isobel said the words that in that second
cut my life into two distinct halves....</p>

<p>"<i>John and I are engaged to be married....</i>"</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>No&mdash;she couldn't have said that. I assured myself
that she had not said <i>that</i>. These queer hallucinations
and strange waking dreams!... She had not said that.... I
was not standing staring and open-mouthed, and watching,
watching, watching for years and life-times and ages and
æons, while two great tears slowly formed and gathered and
grew and rolled from her eyes.... One did not splash upon
my hand as she said:</p>

<p>"And he has had to go away.... And I am so miserable,
Otis.... We were engaged one evening and he was gone the
next morning!... And I have no-one to talk to, about
him.... I am so <i>glad</i> you have come...."</p>

<p>But a tear <i>did</i> splash on my hand. She <i>did</i> say it.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"You and John Geste are engaged to be married, Isobel?"
I asked, gently and carefully, very very gently and very
very carefully, to keep my voice level and steady, to keep
myself well under control....</p>

<p>I heard myself say the words, and I watched her face to
see whether I had said them normally.... Or had I not said
them at all?... I had uttered some words certainly....</p>

<p>Her face did not change....</p>

<p>"Yes, Otis," she said. "And I had to tell somebody! ...
I am glad it was <i>you</i>. You are the only person, now, who
knows. You'll be the first to congratulate me...."</p>

<p>Yes. <i>I</i> should be <i>the</i> first person to congratulate
her!</p>

<p>"I congratulate John&mdash;and you&mdash;Isobel," I
said, "and from the bottom of my heart I hope that every
hour of your life will be a happy one."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Otis," she said. "That is nice and dear of
you.... Oh, I shall be almost too happy to breathe ... when
John comes back....</p>

<p>"You'll come and see us again, won't you? Aunt
Patricia will be delighted to see you.... And we'll go
for some rides, you and I.... I do so want to talk to
you&mdash;<i>about John</i>."</p>

<p>Words of excuse rose to my lips. I must go to London
to-morrow. I must hurry over to Paris. Some business for my
Father. After that I must go quickly back to America, and
so forth.... But before I had spoken, I had a swift vision
of a face I knew well, though I had only seen it in dreams.
A hard clean-cut cruel face, grim, stern and stoical, the
face of that Indian Chief who was the father of my father's
grandmother&mdash;the face of a man from whom no sign of
anguish was ever wrung, a man to whom pain was as a friend,
proven and proving.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much indeed, Isobel," I said. "I
shall love to ride with you&mdash;and&mdash;talk about
John."...</p>

<p>(Thank <i>you</i>, also, great-great-grandfather.)</p>

<p>Yes, it would give her pleasure. I would ride with
her&mdash;and <i>talk about John</i>!</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>During the next month I saw Isobel almost daily, Lady
Brandon occasionally, the Chaplain once or twice, and the
girl, Claudia, from time to time.</p>

<p>Isobel and I talked unceasingly of John. I thought of
things that would please her&mdash;dug up what had been
fragrant joyous memories.</p>

<p>She did not tell me where he was, being, I supposed,
pledged to secrecy, and I asked her no questions as I
realized that there was some secret which she was hiding.
It occurred to me though, that it must be a mighty strong
inducement, an irresistible compulsion, that took John
Geste from Brandon Abbas on the day after the declaration
of his love for Isobel!</p>

<p>And then, thank God, she went away to stay with friends,
and I fled to Paris, plunged into the wildest dreariest
round of dissipation (Good God! is there <i>anything</i> so
devastatingly dreary as pleasure pursued?) and quickly
collapsed as reaction set in, reaction from the dreadful
strain of those days with Isobel&mdash;Isobel and the
ever-present absent John.</p>

<p>I was very ill indeed for some weeks, and, when able
to do so, crawled home&mdash;dropped back again, the
burnt charred stick of that joyous rocket that had rushed
with such brilliant soaring gaiety into the bright sky of
happiness....</p>

<p>Finished and down&mdash;like a dead rocket.... </p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p> Things were, on the whole, rather worse than usual at
home. My Father was becoming more and more tyrannical and
unreasonable, and my sisters were reacting accordingly.
Strong Mary, the rebel, home from College, was fast
approaching both the snapping-point of her temper and the
frame of mind in which Noel had cast off the dust of the
ranch from his feet and the shackles of his Father from his
soul, mind, and body.</p>

<p>Weak Janey, the "suggestible," was fast approaching
the end of her existence as an individual, a separate
identity, and was rapidly becoming a reed, bending in the
blast of her Father's every opinion, idea and wish; a straw
upon the mighty rushing waters of his life; thistle-down
floating upon the windy current of his mental and physical
commotions.</p>

<p>While firmly believing that she loved him, she dreaded
the very sound of his footsteps, and conducted the domestic
side of his affairs in that fear and trembling of a Roman
slave for the master whose smile was sole reward and whose
frown portended death.</p>

<p>Filial love is a beautiful thing, but the slow
destruction of a character, a soul, a personality, an
individuality, is not.</p>

<p>Poor Janey did not think. She quoted Father's thoughts.
She did not need or desire anything; she lived to forestall
and satisfy Father's needs and wishes. She did not live any
life of her own, she lived Father's life and existed to
that end.</p>

<p>Janey was abject to Father, and propitiatory to Mary.
Mary was defiant and rebellious to Father; and sympathetic
but slightly contemptuous, to Janey.</p>

<p>Father was protective, overbearing, loving, violently
autocratic and unbearably irritating toward both of them.
Apparently he simply could <i>not</i> forbear to interfere,
even in things in which he had not the faintest right to
interfere, and in which a different type of man would have
been ashamed to do so.</p>

<p>Of me, he was frankly contemptuous, and what made me
boil with anger was not that, nor the way in which he
treated me, but the fact that <i>I was afraid of him</i>.
Time after time, I screwed up my courage to face him and
out-face him, and time after time I failed. I could not do
it. His fierce eye, his Jovian front, quelled me, and being
quelled, I quailed.</p>

<p>It was reserved for my Father to make me a coward, so
poor a creature that I could not even stand up for my
sisters against him.</p>

<p>But the enemy was, of course, as always, within.
Deep down in my unconscious mind were the seeds sown
in babyhood, in childhood, in boyhood&mdash;the seeds
of Fear&mdash;and they had taken such root, and grown
so strong a weedcrop that I could not pluck them out.
When I conceived the idea of refusing to obey some
unreasonable order, of asserting my right to an opinion,
of remonstrating on behalf of one of the girls, I was
physically as well as mentally affected.</p>

<p>I stammered and stuttered&mdash;a thing I never did at
any other time. I flushed and paled, I perceptibly shook
and trembled, and I burst into a cold perspiration. My
mind became a blank; I looked and felt and was, a fool; I
was not sufficiently effective even to irritate my Father,
and with one frowning piercing stare of his hard eyes, one
contemptuous curl of his expressive lips, I was defeated,
silenced, quelled, brought to heel.</p>

<p>Do not think that our Father was deliberately and
intentionally cruel to any of his children. Cruelty is
a Vice, and Vice was the abhorrent thing, the very seal
and mark of the Devil&mdash;footprint of the cloven
hoof. Did he not spend his life in the denunciation of
Vice in every form and manifestation&mdash;though with
particular abhorrence and detestation of, peculiar rage
and fulminations against, <i>Sex</i>&mdash;its, to him, most
especially shocking and loathsome form?</p>

<p>He was not cruel, but his effect upon us was, and it
drove Mary and me to the decision that home was no place
for us.... We had decided independently&mdash;I, that I
could not work for, nor with, my Father on the ranch, nor
live with him in the house: she, that any place in the
wide world would be preferable to the house in which her
Father intended that she should live and move and have her
being, wholly and solely and exactly as he in his wisdom
directed.</p>

<p>We discovered our decisions to each other and agreed to
act together when the time came; and, as soon as possible
thereafter, to rescue Janey from the loving thraldom and
oppression that would turn her into a weak, willless and
witless old maid, an ageing servant in her father's house,
before she had been a girl.</p>

<p>It was the "old maid" aspect of affairs that
particularly enraged Mary on behalf of both Janey and
herself. For on the subject of "young whelps loafing round
the place," our Father grew more and more unreasonable
and absurd. A presentable man was a suspect, a potential
"scoundrel," a thinker of evil who would become a doer of
evil if given the slightest opportunity. To such we always
alluded as "Means"&mdash;by reason of Father's constant
quotation of the Shakespearian platitude: </p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"The sight of means to do ill deeds, makes
ill deeds done." </p>

<br>

<p> Any sort or kind of non-business communication between
a man and a woman was, unless they were married according
to the (Protestant) Christian Dispensation, undesirable,
wrong, improper; and avowed friendship between them
was little better than Sin, Vice&mdash;nay, was almost
certainly but a cloak for Sin.</p>

<p>Strong Mary, the rebel, suffered most perhaps; weak
Janey and I suffered much, certainly. But we stuck on
somehow, for some reason&mdash;"the inertia of matter,"
apathy, custom, loyalty to Father, and the feeling that our
defection would hurt him more even than his interfering,
regulating tyranny hurt us. Most of all perhaps, because
we knew that Janey would never have the courage nor the
"unkindness" to leave him.</p>

<p>It was a very wretched time indeed for me, apart from
the fact that I was so spiritually bruised and sore
and smashed. My dreams of Isobel came no more, and my
day-dreams of her were poignant suffering. I tried to fight
the lethargy, the hopelessness, the selfish sorrow of my
soul, and to throw myself into the work of the ranch, to
live on horseback a life of constant activity, and to find
an anodyne in labour.</p>

<p>But I was selfish.... I nursed my sorrow.... I thought,
young fool that I was, that my life was permanently
darkened and that none had plumbed such depths of suffering
as I.</p>

<p>And I worked on, hopelessly, sunk in a deep and dark
Byronic gloom.... </p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p> It was a dead hand that released Mary and me from the
irksome dependence of our captivity. I do not know whether
the hand provided "the means to do ill deeds" in providing
us with the opportunity to leave our Father and our home,
but it certainly gave us the power to choose our paths in
life, and we promptly chose the one that led straightest
out into the world of men.</p>

<p>The said hand was that of a Bad Old Man, a meretricious
ornament of the city of San Francisco, a gay dog, a buck,
a lover of Life, who was, alas, my Father's cousin, once
his partner, and known to us from our earliest days as
Uncle Joe. He had all our Father's strength of will and
character; his ability, grit and forcefulness; his uncanny
business skill and his marked individuality. But he had
none of his fervid piety; none of his Old Testamental
patriarchal self-importance; none of his self-righteous
domineering violence; and, I fear, but little of his moral
integrity, virtue, and highly-conscious rectitude.</p>

<p>In spite of this latter lamentable truth, we children
loved him, as our Mother had loved him&mdash;and as Father
hated him. He corrupted us with treats, gifts, sympathy,
and support; he took our part when, as so frequently
happened, we were in disgrace; and he endeavoured to sow in
our young breasts the seeds of revolt and rebellion against
what he considered harshness and oppression.</p>

<p>For some reason I was his favourite. I amused him
intensely, and he apparently saw in me merits and virtues
which were hidden from other eyes. And the misspelling of
a word in a letter that I wrote to him, changed my life
and Mary's life, the lives of my Father and of Janey, and
indeed of very many other people&mdash;for it was the cause
of his leaving me a very large sum of money indeed, the
money that was my ransom from bondage&mdash;and Mary's
ransom too.</p>

<p>It had been my innocent and disinterested custom
to Write a letter to Uncle Joe, upon the occasion of
his birthday. On one of these anniversaries, I, being
some seven or eight years of age&mdash;and having just
discovered the expression "hoary old age"&mdash;wrote my
annual letter and concluded by wishing him eventual safe
arrival at such penultimate years. But having acquired the
phrase by ear and not by eye, I misspelt a word.</p>

<p>The hoary sinner was delighted beyond measure, roared
with laughter, shouted with joyous amusement, and swore
then and there that he would make me his heir and leave me
every last red cent of which he died possessed! He then
rushed forth brandishing the letter, in search of all to
whom he might impart the jest, and for days and weeks the
bars of San Francisco's clubs, restaurants, saloons and
hostelries echoed with laughter and my Uncle's shame.</p>

<p>Such conduct gives the measure of the wickedness
of the man who had been a thorn in the side of my
Father&mdash;until the day on which the latter felt that he
could prosper without him, that Mammon of Unrighteousness,
and cast him forth; the man who had been our dear, dear
friend; the man to whom Mary and I owed our salvation.</p>

<p>And at this critical moment he died&mdash;and he left me
all his money.</p>

<p>Of course, what was mine was Mary's, and at the
earliest moment we fared forth together, "to seek our
fortunes"&mdash;though not in the material sense, and to
see the World.</p>

<p>A drop of regret in the cup of our joy was the fact
that we found it utterly and completely impossible to
induce Janey to come with us. She would not "leave
Father"&mdash;the simple truth being that she lacked the
courage to tell him that she was going with us, the courage
to let us tell him that she was going with us, the courage
even to slip away with us, or to run away and join us after
our departure.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to leave her at home,
though with the most urgent entreaties to join us at any
time that she could induce Father to permit her to come, or
pluck up sufficient courage to come unpermitted....</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Our idea was, of course, to make straight for
Paris&mdash;the name of which place, Mary declared, was
but an abbreviation of the word "Paradise"&mdash;and after
sating ourselves with its wonders, make the grand tour of
Europe. After that we were going to settle down in Paris,
and I was going to obtain employment at our Embassy, for
I had no liking for the profession of rich-man's-son and
idler. Mary was going to keep house for me&mdash;but I
doubted that it would be my house that she would keep for
very long, and so I think did she.... Anyhow, that was
roughly our programme, and, after what seemed an age of
delay, we set forth, without the paternal blessing, to see
how far we should carry out the scheme. </p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="first">
Life in Paris was, to Mary, wholly delightful, and to
me was at least as good and as bad as life in Wyoming. In
point of fact it was wholly lacking in savour wheresoever
I might endure it&mdash;but in Paris the heavy cloud, that
was our Father, was on the far western horizon and no
longer obscured the sun&mdash;a further exemplification of
the ancient truth that they who flee across the sea change
nothing but their sky.</p>

<p>Our friends at the Embassy were more than kind to us,
and before we departed for London, Rome, Venice, Naples,
Athens and finally Algiers, we had a large and delightful
circle of acquaintance, French, American and English.</p>

<p>Mary is one of those girls who are "very easy to look
at," and the young men of our circle looked. They also
danced, dined, drove and flirted with her to her heart's
content, if not to theirs.</p>

<p>As I spent my money very freely, she was soon reputed to
be the usual fabulously wealthy American heiress, and the
report did not lessen her popularity.</p>

<p>Prominent among her admirers was a much-decorated and
be-medalled Colonel of Zouaves, a man who might have sat
for a portrait of a typical Sergeant of the Old Guard
of Napoleon Buonaparte. He was a middle-aged self-made
fighting soldier&mdash;a man of the kind that one rather
admires for excellences of character than likes for
graces of mind and person&mdash;and I fear he amused Mary
almost as much as he loved her. For he was obviously and
hopelessly in love, and I do not think that the dollars in
any way gilded the refined gold of <i>La belle Americaine</i> in
the eyes of the tough and grizzled Colonel Levasseur....
Poor fellow!... Bravely playing his part in the ballroom,
or at the garden-party, he reminded me, when dancing
attendance on my sister, of a large bear heavily cavorting
around a young deer&mdash;though I realized that the
Colonel would remind me still more of a large bear if I saw
him engaged upon his real business, which was fighting.</p>

<p>Here again was coincidence or the hand of Fate&mdash;or
as some, including myself, would prefer to say&mdash;the
hand of God. For when, after our European travels, we
reached Algeria to bask in winter sunshine, Colonel
Levasseur was preparing to set forth, as the point of a
lancet of "peaceful penetration," to the fanatical city
of Zaguig, a distant hotbed of sedition and centre of
disaffection, a desert Cave of Adullam wherein the leaders
of every anti-French faction, from eastern Senussi to
western Riffian, plotted together and tried to stem the
flow of the tide of civilization.</p>

<p>They stood for savagery; for blind adherence to the dead
letter of a creed outworn; for ferocious hatred of all
that was not sealed of Islam; and for the administration
of rapine, fire, and slaughter impartially to those who
brought, and those who accepted, northern civilization
and its roads, railways, telegraphs, peace, order and
cultivation of the soil....</p>

<p>While Zaguig remained secret, veiled, inviolate
and aloof, there could be no safety, and, as Colonel
Levasseur put it, Zaguig was a boil that the French must
lance&mdash;that there might be health in the body-politic
of a great and growing colony, a future granary and garden
and farm for the sons of civilization.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Colonel Levasseur showed better in Algiers than in
Paris, and he showed best of all in Zaguig at the head of
his men, in his element and on his native heath&mdash;or
his adopted heath.</p>

<p>For, later on, as I shall tell, I yielded to Mary's
impulsive yearnings to go and see a "really unspoilt"
desert town, and I accepted Colonel Levasseur's invitation
to visit him there, an invitation that coincided with her
disillusionment at Bouzen, a spoilt and vulgarized place
at the end of the railway, a plague-spot where alleged
"desert" Arabs spoke broken French and English to the
trippers, and richly earned broken necks every day of their
ignoble touting lives.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>And to Bouzen from Zaguig came Colonel
Levasseur&mdash;ostensibly to confer with the Commandant of
the big garrison there&mdash;fairly quickly after learning
that Mary was shedding the light of her countenance on that
already well-lighted spot.</p>

<p>He took Mary riding on horse and camel, turning
a withering Colonel-glare upon the gay and gorgeous
subalterns who had hitherto danced attendance upon her....
He amused her and he had the inevitable appeal of the
strong man who has done things, who has a fine and big job
and holds it down.</p>

<p>And he played up to her growing love of the desert,
for she had succumbed to its lure and its loveliness of
sunrise, sunset, space, colour, cleanness and enduring
mystery. Also he told her that <i>this</i> was not the
desert&mdash;that she had not yet seen the real desert, nor
set eyes on a genuine inhabitant thereof, Bedouin, Senussi,
Touareg, nor any other.... Also, that now was her chance,
her chance to cross a tract of the genuine desert-Sahara
and see a genuine desert-city, a lion's den whereof he had
effectually cowed and tamed the lions....</p>

<p>I asked Mary if the acceptance of his very kind and
attractive invitation might not be construed as portending
her acceptance of the inevitable proposal of marriage
which would most surely ensue, if we entered the said
lions' den&mdash;whereof Colonel Levasseur was now the
lion-tamer&mdash;but only to receive the enigmatical reply
that sufficient unto the day is the proposal thereof, and
that if I did not take her to Zaguig, Colonel Levasseur
would.</p>

<p>The which there was no gainsaying&mdash;and Mary is a
witch whom there is no gainsaying.</p>

<p>The delighted Colonel Levasseur, for some reason,
inferred that I had had a helpful hand in Mary's decision
to accept his invitation. And he expressed his gratitude to
me in various ways, in spite of my denial of deserts.</p>

<p>One took the curious form of insisting upon showing me
"life" in Bouzen, by night&mdash;<i>recherché</i> "life" not
seen of the tripper, but solely of the elect&mdash;such as
highly placed executive officials, for example, only by
whose grace and favour, or ignorance and blindness, such
"life" could exist.</p>

<p>Most men accept an invitation of this sort, and offer a
variety of reasons for so doing. Some allege that "life"
is, and must be, interesting to any intelligent person, and
murmur "<i>nihil humanum ... a me alienum puto</i>," adding that
none but the fool misses any rare, genuine "local colour"
that may be seen; and that, in any case, one would not like
to hurt the feelings of the good fellow who had gone to the
trouble of providing the opportunity.</p>

<p>As these were precisely my authentic reasons for
accepting the invitation, I went with the worthy
Colonel&mdash;and mine eyes beheld strange things.</p>

<p>We set forth after Mary had said her good-nights, she
imagining that we were also about to seek our respective
chaste couches.</p>

<p>Nothing was said to her on the subject of our expedition
lest she insist upon joining us, and we be put to the shame
of telling the truth or of abandoning the tour of the
select improprieties. Incidentally I noted, in my mental
<i>dossier</i> of the Colonel, that he was unselfish enough to
devote to me time that might have been spent with Mary had
he chosen to announce some different form of nocturnal
entertainment, and also that he was of the type that could
go straight, from looking upon the face of the beloved
lady, to where every prospect pleases only a man who is
vile....</p>

<p>Let us, however, concede that it takes all sorts to make
a universe, and humbly thank Allah for the diversity of his
creatures.</p>

<p>As I had anticipated, I found, once more, that the
deadliest, dreariest and dullest pursuit upon which the
mind and body of man can embark is the deliberate pursuit
of pleasure&mdash;that butterfly that flies indeed if
chased, but will often settle if ignored&mdash;settle and
delight the soul of the beholder.</p>

<p>I suppressed all yawns, endeavoured to simulate a polite
if not keen interest, and failed to give the worthy Colonel
the impression that I was enjoying myself.</p>

<p>So when he asked me if I were doing so, I said:</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, Colonel" ... and added, "It is the only
thing I <i>am</i> enjoying" ... whereat he laughed, commended
my bluntness which matched his own, and promised that I
should find the next place stimulating, for I should there
encounter the Angel of Death.</p>

<p>I assured him that I was unready, unfit, unworthy; that
I did not desire to encounter the Death Angel with all
my imperfections on my head; unshriven, unassoiled and
unannealed.... So young.... So promising....</p>

<p>"Wait till you have seen her," replied the Colonel, and
I withdrew my objections and listened, as we drove through
the silent streets, to his account of the lady whose
disturbing and deterrent title was "the Angel of Death," a
title well-earned, I gathered, and well-given in return for
disservices rendered....</p>

<p>Well, it would be something to make the acquaintance
of an incarnate Death Angel, especially if one might then
plead fear of anti-climax as an excuse for abandoning the
pursuit of pleasure, going straight home, and prosaically
to bed.</p>

<p>As the car stopped at a gate in the high wall
surrounding a native house and garden, on the outskirts of
the town, I, in Hunnish vandal mood, murmured certain lines
learned in childhood from Uncle Joe: </p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"The Death Angel smote Alexander McCloo <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gave him protracted repose; <br>
&nbsp;He had a check shirt and a number nine shoe <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a very pink wart on his nose."</p>

<br>

<p> Well, the Death Angel smote me also, that night, but
did not give me protracted repose (nor any protracted lack
of repose&mdash;at the time).</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>The brightly-lit scene of our entertainment was the
typical compound of the typical house of the wealthy
town-Arab, the soft-living degenerate <i>hadri</i>, for whom the
son of the desert has so great a contempt.</p>

<p>Our host, one Abu Sheikh Ahmed, a rotund well-nourished
person with a bad squint, a bad pock-pitted face, and an
oily ingratiating manner, received us with every evidence
of joy, pride and respectful affection. He seemed grateful
to us for existing; declared that all in his house was
ours; that we were, each of us, his father and his mother
both; and that Allah had this night been merciful and
gracious unto him in that He had caused the light of our
countenances to shine upon him and illuminate and glorify
his humble gathering of guests.</p>

<p>Colonel Levasseur received these transports with dignity
and restraint&mdash;particularly restraint&mdash;and
informed me in English that Abu Sheikh Ahmed was a
carpet-dealer and had the distinction of being the
wickedest, most untrustworthy and most plausible old
scoundrel that he had ever met.</p>

<p>"He'd be the first to fly to the Commandant with
completest revelations of any plot that could not succeed;
and the first to shoot him in the back, or cut his throat,
in the event of one that did succeed," said he. "So we take
him at his true value and use him for what he is worth....
He'll give us an amusing show anyhow...."</p>

<p>He did; a show of which there were two items that, as
far as I am concerned, proved quite unforgettable; the one
for its hideousness, the other for its beauty&mdash;and its
sequel.</p>

<p>The former was a "turn" by a troupe of Aissa dervishes,
and consisted of maddeningly monotonous music and
dancing&mdash;the twirling and spinning dancers quickly and
obviously falling into a state of hypnosis; of a disgusting
exhibition of self-mutilation by means of knives and
skewers, driven into the arms, chest and legs and in some
cases through the cheeks and even the tongue; of the eating
of burning tow; and of the genuine chewing and actual
swallowing of quantities of broken glass.</p>

<p>It is not given to the Sons of the Prophet to know
the joys of a "next morning" head, as teetotalism is a
primary essential of Muhammedanism, but I was moved to
ponder the sensations of a "next morning" stomach, after an
indiscreetly copious feast of broken glass.</p>

<p>Colonel Levasseur had seen this sort of thing before,
and regarded it with the cold eye of familiarity, if not
boredom.</p>

<p>"Enjoying yourself?" he asked me, when the din and
devilry were at their climax.</p>

<p>"Not even myself, this time," I replied, and was very
glad when these holy men completed their exhibition
of piety, and departed. The odour of sanctity was as
unpleasing as the saints from whom it emanated.</p>

<p>I do not know whether Mr. Abu Sheikh Ahmed was an
amateur of entertainment sufficiently skilful to appreciate
the value of contrast, and deliberately to preface the
beauty of the next item by the bestial ugliness of this
one. Probably not&mdash;but certainly the vision of
loveliness, that now enthralled the gathering, lost nothing
by the juxtaposition.</p>

<p>In the centre of one side of a square, three sides of
which were rows of Arab notables, and the fourth, the high
white house, the Colonel and I occupied plush-upholstered
European arm-chairs of astounding ugliness, while our host
and his young son sat cross-legged upon the sofa of the
same afflicted and afflicting family, the six pertaining
small chairs being allotted to his chief friends, or
enemies, who awkwardly sat upon them in dignity and
discomfort.</p>

<p>In the guest-surrounded square, servants spread a large
thick carpet, a carpet whereof the sheer beauty made me
blush&mdash;for the European furniture that affronted it
and the perfect night and the austere grace of the snowy
draperies of the assembly....</p>

<p>A current of awakened interest now ran through the
latter, a movement that announced the arrival of an awaited
moment. There was an atmosphere of pleased anticipation
that indicated both the <i>pièce de résistance</i> and the
certainty of high entertainment therefrom.</p>

<p>Brilliant teeth flashed white, as bearded lips parted in
joyous smiles. Almost I fancied that pink tongues licked,
beast-like, anticipatory, appreciative.</p>

<p>Our host beamed upon us, a pleased and pleasing smile of
promise and of pride.</p>

<p>"Behold the Angel of Death," murmured Colonel Levaseeur,
and a woman appeared at the entrance to the house, walked
disdainfully to the carpet, threw off a gauze veil and
gazed calmly around.</p>

<p>There was a murmur of admiration, wonder,
praise&mdash;and appraisal; and I heard Colonel Levasseur
sigh and gasp with a little catch of the breath. There
was something very simple and elemental about poor
Levasseur.</p>

<p>And there was something indescribably arresting,
fascinating, wonderful about the real and remarkable beauty
of the girl.... She was at once pretty, lovely, beautiful
and handsome ... quite indescribable.... Yes.... She was
astounding....</p>

<p>To begin with, she was so fair that you thought
her European until you realized her blue-black hair,
unbelievable black eyelashes and eyebrows and the Oriental
moulding of the cheek-bones and lips&mdash;so brunette and
Oriental that you thought her the true Arab Princess of a
dream of an Arabian Nights' tale, until you realized her
white skin, her rose-pink cheeks, her obviously northern
complexion and European blood.</p>

<p>Of her figure I can but say it was worthy of her face.
It was perfect, and what was to be seen of her neck and
limbs was as white as flesh can be....</p>

<p>She was a human flower.... An orchid&mdash;a white
orchid marked with scarlet and with black. And as these
flowers always do, she looked wicked&mdash;an incarnate,
though very lovely, potentiality for evil.</p>

<p>Catching sight, I suppose, of Colonel Levasseur's gay
uniform, she came straight to us, or rather floated toward
us on her toes, her graceful arms and hands also appearing
to float upon the air, quietly waving around her head and
body like thistle-down and like gracefulness personified.
One forgot the crudeness of the music, for she subordinated
it to her purposes, and, becoming part of her and her
movement, it was beautiful.</p>

<p>Straight to us she came, and at me she looked, giving no
glance of recognition to the chagrined Levasseur. With a
deep, deep curtsy of mocking homage and genuine challenge,
that broke her slow revolving dance at my very feet, she
sank to the ground, and, rising like a swift-growing flower
from the earth&mdash;like Aphrodite herself from the
wine-dark sea&mdash;she gazed straight into my eyes, smiled
with the allure of all the sirens, Delilahs, Sapphos,
Aspasias, Jezebels and Cleopatras that ever lived, and
whispered&mdash;to me&mdash;as if she and I were alone in
all Africa ... alone in the gracious night, beneath the
serene moon and throbbing stars ... alone together, she and
I, at the door of our silken tent under the graceful palms
of our secret oasis ... she and I, alone together upon the
silken cushions and the silken carpet spread upon the warm
honey-coloured sands....</p>

<p>Good God in Heaven&mdash;what was this? I struggled like
a drowning man ... I <i>was</i> a drowning man, sinking down ...
down ... hypnotized ...</p>

<p>"<i>No! No!</i>" I shouted. "<i>No!...</i>" The only flower
for me was an English rose.... What had I to do with
orchids of Africa? Had I really shouted?... What was she
whispering?... French?...</p>

<p>"<i>Beaux yeux bleus!... J'aime les yeux bleus!...
Baisez-moi!... Aimez-moi!... Venez avec moi ... après!...</i>
I lov' you so.... <i>Je t'aime!... Je t'adore!...</i> Kees me,
sweetheart.... Crrrush me in your arms, darling.... <i>J'ai
attendu.... Et tu es arrive ... J'ai attendu ... depuis
longtemps ... il y a longtemps ... J'ai attendu.... Et tu
es arrivé.... Maintenant.... Baisez-moi!... Embrassez-moi,
mon amant Anglais</i> ... ah ..."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>She was talking French.... Was she speaking at all?...
Was she talking faulty French and broken English, with the
accent of the educated French-and English-speaking Arab?...
No. Her lips were not moving&mdash;but her eyes were
holding mine; burning into mine.... Her eyes were great
irresistible magnets drawing my soul through my eyes into
hers and through them, down into her soul where it would be
lost for ever, engulfed, held, drowned, destroyed.</p>

<p>"<i>No!</i>" I shouted, and burst into a profuse
perspiration as I clung with the strength of despair
to&mdash;to&mdash;sanity, to self-respect, to honour ... to
Isobel....</p>

<p>And then I shook off the shackles of this absurd
folly&mdash;or this devilish, hellish danger&mdash;and was
an ordinary tourist from the north smiling at this ordinary
dancing-girl of the south....</p>

<p>But ... and I shivered slightly ... she was not
ordinary ... Neither in her evil loveliness, nor in her
evil, conscious, or unconscious, hypnotic power, was she
ordinary.</p>

<p>Had she actually spoken?</p>

<p>Had I actually cried aloud?</p>

<p>With a real effort, I wrenched my eyes from hers, and
glanced around. The Arabs were watching her as a circle of
dogs a luscious piece of meat&mdash;which is what she was
to them.</p>

<p>Levasseur was smiling cynically and without
amusement.</p>

<p>"You are favoured, my friend," he growled, as she
floated away on her toes&mdash;her hands and her arms
floating about her as she did so.</p>

<p>"Did she speak to me?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not that I heard," he answered in surprise. "She
certainly intends to do so, though.... Beware, St.
Anthony.... They don't call her the Angel of Death for
nothing...."</p>

<p>I decided that neither she nor I had uttered a sound,
that she had paused before me for but a moment&mdash;and
yet I <i>knew</i> that, if ever she spoke to me, she would
speak in faulty French and broken English, with the
accent of those Arabs who have learnt a little French and
English&mdash;as many of the town-dwelling Arabs do, for
purposes of business.</p>

<p>This was interesting, a little too interesting perhaps.
It was also absurd, utterly ridiculous, perfectly
impossible. I could have sworn that I had shouted "<i>No!</i>"
at the top of my voice, and had recoiled violently.</p>

<p>Obviously I had uttered no sound and had not moved in my
arm-chair.... But why was I trembling from head to foot,
and wet with a cold perspiration that had no relation to
the pleasant temperature of the night? Why did I recover my
normal serenity and self-control in inverse proportion to
her proximity?</p>

<p>While she swayed mockingly before an Arab who sat in the
most distant corner of the square, her back toward me, I
took my eyes from her and turned again to Levasseur, as the
Arab, his face transfigured, his burning eyes riveted on
her face, his clutching hands extended, rose slowly to his
feet.</p>

<p>"Who <i>is</i> she?" I said, controlling my voice as best I
might.</p>

<p>"Who <i>is</i> she, M'sieu' St. Anthony?" mocked the Colonel,
evidently still a little piqued. "She is the Angel of
Death, as I think I have already told you."</p>

<p>"Well; tell me a little more about her," I said,
shortly.</p>

<p>"Well; she is what you see she is&mdash;and a good
deal more.... Among other things she is the daughter of
a very famous Ouled-Naïl dancing-girl.... Eh, <i>mon ami</i>,
but a dancing-girl of a beauty.... Of a beauty ... of
a fascination ... of an allure ... <i>ravissante</i>!" and
the Colonel kissed his stubby fingers and waved them at
the stars, his somewhat heavy, bovine gaze momentarily
aflame.</p>

<p>"Ah! the marvelous ... the incredible ... the untellable
'Zaza Blanchfleur,' as we called her.... But <i>that</i> was a
woman ... a houri from Paradise...."</p>

<p>"And the father?" I broke in upon the rhapsody. "A
Frenchman I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Said to be an Englishman," replied the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Certainly European," I observed.</p>

<p>"Oh, but yes, it leaps to the eye, that; does it not,
<i>mon ami</i>? That white skin, those unpainted cheeks.... Yes,
they say he was an Englishman.... The Death Angel believes
so, anyhow ... and her great desire in life is to meet
him."</p>

<p>"Filial affection is a wonderful thing," I observed.</p>

<p>"It'll prove so, in this case," said the Colonel. "For
if the little angel gets near enough, she'll cut his throat
till his head falls backward&mdash;<i>boump!</i>&mdash;so....
Yes; she loves all Europeans&mdash;especially the
English&mdash;for her father's sake!"</p>

<p>"What! Ill-treated her, I suppose?" I said, my eyes
again turning to where the girl beguiled the Arab, and was
now bending over backward towards him, that he might place
a coin of gold on her forehead among the gold coins of the
<i>sokhab</i> tiara that adorned it.</p>

<p>"No, no," murmured the Colonel lazily, as he gazed
at the smoke that was curling from his cigarette. "She
never knew him, I believe. It's her mother she wishes to
avenge."</p>

<p>"Ill-treated the mother?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well; I wouldn't say <i>that</i>.... He merely
did&mdash;er&mdash;what one does.... One tires, of course
... of the loveliest of them.... One gathers that <i>ce bon
Monsieur Anglais</i> took her from the Street of a Thousand
Delights away out into the&mdash;er&mdash;Desert of One
Delight.... An individualist, one perceives.... Installed
his <i>chère amie</i> in the desert-equivalent of a flat or
a <i>maisonnette</i>&mdash;probably a green canvas tent from
London.... A desert idyll....</p>

<p>"A great lover, one would say, this Englishman ..."
mused the Colonel. "Of a certainty he captured the heart of
our Zaza&mdash;and broke it.... No ... nothing cruel.... He
just dropped it&mdash;and it just broke ... like any other
fragile thing that one drops.... He left her....</p>

<p>"She was never the same again, our little one.... She
became positively nun-like.... And then, a little strange
... <i>distraite</i>.... Other-world and other-where, one would
say ... even in moments of love.... And, in time, a little
mad.... And then more than a little mad.... And then quite
mad.... Oh, mad as Ophelia.... And through these years, the
years of hoping ... the heart-sick years of hope deferred
... the heart-broken years of realization ... the years of
growing insanity ... the years of madness, she talked of
him.... Always she talked of him and his return....</p>

<p>"Yes, of a truth, he broke her heart."</p>

<p>"One does not somehow imagine the heart of a Zaza
Blanchfleur to be very fragile," I observed.</p>

<p>"That is why I say this Englishman was a great lover,"
said Levasseur. "For certainly the little one's heart had
been taken up&mdash;and dropped&mdash;before.... By General
and by Subaltern ... by civilian and by sheikh ... by
aristocrat and by plutocrat ... by the richest and by the
handsomest.... Had been dropped&mdash;and had gracefully
rebounded to be caught by the next....</p>

<p>"But when the Englishman dropped it, it was
shattered&mdash;and Zaza Blanchfleur lived with a broken
heart until she died of a broken heart....</p>

<p>"And the Angel of Death desires earnestly ... oh, but
<i>earnestly</i>&mdash;to meet her papa.... And, meanwhile, any
white man serves her purpose&mdash;her purpose of revenge
... serves to glut her hate, to fill her coffers and to
slake her passion to avenge her mother."</p>

<p>"She must have adored her mother," I observed.</p>

<p>"Everybody adored her mother," said the Colonel
sententiously, and heaved a deep sigh, a sigh that,
one felt, claimed one's sympathy and the tribute of a
tear....</p>

<p>The Angel of Death&mdash;and certainly she moved
with the lightness and grace of a being endowed with
wings&mdash;came circling, gliding, floating toward me
again.</p>

<p>Row upon row of enigmatic dark faces.... Hundreds of
hard watching eyes....</p>

<p>The fierce-looking hawk-faced young Arab, with whom
she had coquetted, arose from his place, and came round
the outside of the square of intently-staring onlookers,
until he was behind the chairs occupied by the Colonel and
myself.</p>

<p>"Have you a gold coin?" asked Levasseur. "She is
going to favour you again. The correct thing is to lay a
twenty-franc piece, or a sovereign, on her forehead, when
she bends over backward with her face turned up to you."</p>

<p>Should I avoid her gaze this time&mdash;refuse to look
her in the face? Absurd&mdash;a half-caste dancing-girl of
the bazaars of Bouzen....</p>

<p>She was before me again, and I was a captive fly about
which a lovely and bejewelled spider was weaving the bonds
from which there is no escape but death.... Her arms were
weaving ... weaving ... weaving ... mesmeric ... hypnotic
... compelling....</p>

<p>She approached yet closer.</p>

<p>With a great mental and moral effort I wrenched my
mind or soul violently from hers, and thrust my hand
into my pocket for a coin. I would simply follow the
"custom of the country"&mdash;signify my approval of her
skill in the usual manner, tip this perfectly ordinary
dancing-girl&mdash;and then tell Levasseur I was more than
ready to return to the hotel....</p>

<p>The Angel of Death saw my movement in search of money,
but instead of turning her back to me and bending over
until her face looked up into mine, she threw herself at
my feet, knelt with arms out-stretched, and bringing her
wonderful face closer and closer to mine, whispered:</p>

<p>"<i>Chèri!... Beaux yeux bleus!...</i> Lov' me!... I lov'
you!... Kiss me, Beau'ful blue-eyes.... Kiss me!...
Quick!..."</p>

<p>Now, Heaven knows, I am no saint, and I know I am no
priggish pompous fool.... There could be no earthly harm
in my kissing this girl. No more harm than there is in any
snatched under-the-mistletoe kiss. But the last kiss that
I had ever exchanged, had been with a dear little child at
Brandon Abbas&mdash;ah, how dear!&mdash;a sweet and lovely
little angel; an Angel of Life, if this was the Angel of
Death....</p>

<p>I did not want to hurt this dancing-girl's feelings, but
neither did I want to kiss her. In fact, I wasn't going to
kiss her, whatever happened.</p>

<p>"<i>Kiss</i> her, man," snapped Colonel Levasseur, disgusted,
I suppose, at the stupid, graceless and cold-blooded
Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>"Thanks&mdash;but I never kiss," I said, both to the
girl and to him.</p>

<p>The Colonel snorted; the girl's eyes blazed; and I felt
an uncomfortable fool.</p>

<p>Simultaneously the young Arab made some movement behind
my chair, Colonel Levasseur shouted something at him in
Arabic, and the girl thrust her angry face almost against
mine.</p>

<p>"<i>Kiss me!</i>" she whispered tensely, and the eyes, that
had seemed to blaze, narrowed, and looked as deadly cold as
those of a snake.</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"I never kiss people," I said, and before my lips had
well closed, her right hand went to her sash, flashed
upward and fell with a sharp and heavy blow on my
shirt-front, exactly over my heart....</p>

<p>I felt no pain.... That would come.... Numbed....</p>

<p>Levasseur sprang to his feet, hurled the young Arab
back, and seized the girl's wrist as though to snap her
arm.</p>

<p>"You she-devil!" he growled and, as she laughed
mockingly, glanced from the knife that gleamed in her hand,
to my breast.</p>

<p>I laughed also&mdash;a somewhat nervous laugh of relief,
she had not stabbed me as I had supposed. She had struck
with all her strength, but in the moment of impact she had
turned the point of the knife inward, and had merely struck
me with the clenched fist that held the knife.</p>

<p>It was over in a second, and she was whirling away again
upon the tips of her toes. But few had seen what actually
happened&mdash;and they had merely seen a girl offer a
kiss, receive a refusal, and give a blow.</p>

<p>Turning swiftly from the girl to the jealous Arab,
Colonel Levasseur showed something of the tiger that
undoubtedly lurked beneath the heavy and somewhat dull
exterior of the man.</p>

<p>What he said, I did not catch; but the Arab recoiled
from the ferocious glare of the French officer's baleful
eye, the gleam of his bared teeth. I thought the big
clenched fist was about to crash into the Arab's face, but
it shot out with pointed finger, as the Colonel concluded
with an order, shouted as at a dog.</p>

<p>"<i>Imshi!</i>" he roared. "Get out of it, you black
hound!..." and the Arab slunk off toward the compound
gate.</p>

<p>Impassive faces seemed to harden ... hundreds of
watching eyes to narrow....</p>

<p>Our host, apparently petrified with terror and
amazement, now pulled himself together, rolled off his
sofa, and prostrated himself before his guest.</p>

<p>When he had finished his protestations of grief, horror,
outrage and alarm&mdash;perfervid declarations that he was
shamed for life, his face blackened for ever, his salt
betrayed, his roof dishonoured, his fame besmirched, his
self-respect destroyed, his life laid in ruins&mdash;by the
action of the vile criminal whom the Colonel had so rightly
driven forth into outer darkness&mdash;Levasseur quietly
remarked:</p>

<p>"<i>Bien!</i> I hold you responsible then, that every
movement of that seditious, insolent dog, Selim ben Yussuf,
is reported to the <i>Bureau</i>.... And look you, Abu Sheikh
Ahmed, if he sets foot in Zaguig without my knowing it, on
your head be it...."</p>

<p>"On my head and my life, Excellency," replied Abu Sheikh
Ahmed, touching his forehead and breast, as he bowed humbly
before the angry Colonel.</p>

<p>Levasseur then thanked him for the entertainment,
bade him continue the music and the dance until we were
well away; and then, with a brief, "Come along, Monsieur
Vanbrugh," marched off to the door, our host trotting
beside us, voluble to the last.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"What was wrong with the good
What's-his-name&mdash;Selim?" I asked as we seated
ourselves in the waiting car.</p>

<p>"A cursed great knife, my friend," replied the Colonel,
"broad and sharp and curly.... That's what was wrong....
His hand was on it as I happened to glance over my
shoulder.... I believe that both he and the girl each
thought the other was going to stab you, and so neither
did...."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense, Colonel," I laughed, "She was only giving
me a little fright because I refused her kiss, and he was
just being dramatic&mdash;to please her...."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, my friend," replied Levasseur, "doubtless
<i>you</i> know the Arab best&mdash;and particularly
Mademoiselle the Angel of Death and Monsieur Selim ben
Yussuf, who is literally mad for her."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The son of the Sheikh of an extremely powerful and
important tribe," was the reply. "An old man whose
friendship is worth a very great deal to us.... Make all
the difference at Zaguig.... Worth a whole brigade.... He's
very loyal, friendly and peaceable, but things will be
different when his mantle descends to Master Selim&mdash;if
our fool politicians let it.... I'd shoot the dog on sight,
if I had <i>my</i> way.... Let's stop the car and walk a bit,
shall we? I've been sitting down all day."</p>

<p>I was quite agreeable. We got out, and the Colonel bade
the soldier-chauffeur return to his quarters.</p>

<p>"Are these streets at all dangerous at night?" I asked
my companion, as we strolled along through the silent
moonlit dream-city of whitest light and blackest shadow.</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> is, very&mdash;in more ways than one," he
replied, pointing up a somewhat narrower lane, the entrance
to which we were just passing. "There are a good few
murders, up there, in the course of the year.... We can go
that way.... It's rather interesting."</p>

<p>"Murders?" I observed, as we turned into the street.
"Robbery?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Robbery ... Jealousy ... Hate.... Sometimes the
spider kills the fly. Sometimes the fly is a wasp and kills
the spider."</p>

<p>It was a strange street. Silent as Death; wide awake and
watchful as Life: furtive and secret as Night: open and
obvious as Day.</p>

<p>There was no movement, no sound, no invitation; but
there were eyes, there were open doors that looked like the
mouths of tombs, there were mystery and evil and danger in
the black shadows, in the very moonlight, the air....</p>

<p>As we passed the first open door, I saw that it framed a
curious picture. Back in the darkness, with which a small
native lamp struggled feebly, sat a perfectly motionless
figure, bedizened, bejewelled, posed, suggesting an idol
dressed up for a barbarous religious ceremony, or the
priest of such an idol, watching through the night before
its shrine. No movement of the body of this priest or idol
caused the slightest change in the reflections from bright
jewels, shining gold, or gleaming cloth of silver, the
slightest sound from heavy armlets, chains, anklets, girdle
or bracelets&mdash;but, as we passed, the eyes followed us,
gleaming....</p>

<p>And so in the next house ... and the next ... and the
next; so in every house in the silent listening street, the
waiting, watchful, motionless street, which the bold and
hardy man beside me had declared to be very dangerous, in
more ways than one.</p>

<p>"Interesting people, those Ouled-Naïl dancing-girls,"
observed Levasseur. "They've danced, and they've sat in
this street, for a couple of thousand years or so. They
danced for Julius Cæsar and Scipio Africanus&mdash;and for
Jugurtha too&mdash;as they danced for you and me, and for
old Abu Sheikh Ahmed.... Roman generals took them to Rome
and French generals take them to Paris.... There isn't much
they don't know about the art of charming.... A hundred
generations of hereditary lore.... Most intriguing and
attractive...."</p>

<p>"A matter of taste," I observed. "Personally I'd
pay handsomely&mdash;to be excused. I don't see how a
bedizened, painted, probably unwashed, half-savage Jezebel
is going to 'interest, intrigue, and attract,' a person of
any taste and refinement."</p>

<p>I spoke a little warmly and wondered whether I did
protest too much, as I thought of the Angel of Death.</p>

<p>The Colonel was faintly annoyed, methought. Perhaps he,
a person of taste and refinement, had been interested,
intrigued and attracted.</p>

<p>"One of them attracted the Englishman to some purpose,"
he growled. "He took her from this very street.... I could
show you the house.... Zaza Blanchfleur.... He treated
her like a bride.... Regular honeymoon.... Fitted out
a splendid caravan, and went off a long way into the
desert.... Oh, yes, she interested <i>him</i> all right, and
for quite a while too.... And what about her daughter, the
Angel of Death? She has interested a few people of taste
and refinement, I can tell you!... Some names that would
surprise you...."</p>

<p>"And did she sit in this street too?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Of course she did, at first.... But she has walked in
a few other streets since ... Bond Street: Rue de la Paix:
Unter den Linden: Nevsky Prospect: the Ringetrasse: Corso:
Prado: Avenido: visited nearly all the capitals of Europe,
she says."</p>

<p>"What's to become of a girl like that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;marry a big Sheikh and go out into the desert
for good&mdash;or a rich Moor and go into a <i>hareem</i> in
Fez&mdash;stay here and amass wealth&mdash;go to Paris,
Marseilles or Algiers&mdash;she may die a princess on a
silken bed in a Sultan's palace, or on the floor of a foul
den in Port Said...."</p>

<p>The Colonel sighed, and the subject dropped. </p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="first">
At Zaguig, Colonel Levasseur was in his element,
monarch of all he surveyed, and greatly he loved playing
the monarch before the amused eyes of Mary, who enormously
enjoyed the opportunity of "getting nearer to life" as she
called it, and "seeing the Oriental on his native heath,"
unoccidentalized and undefiled&mdash;or unpurified and
unregenerate.</p>

<p>Zaguig contained nothing European, and it intended
to contain nothing European if it could help it.
Unfortunately, its representatives had not even that
moderate degree of straight speech and fair dealing which
prevails in European diplomacy, and hid the bitterest
hate and most evil intentions behind the most loving
protestations, honeyed words and outward signs of
friendship.</p>

<p>I am not a politician nor a world-reformer, neither a
publicist nor a sociologist, and I have no views to offer
on the subject of the ethics of the "peaceful penetration"
of an uncivilized country by a civilized one. But nobody
could travel southward from Bouzen, contrasting the Desert
with the Sown, without perceiving that the penetration
was for the greatest good of the greatest number, and
ultimately for the whole world's good, inasmuch as
cultivation and production succeeded fallow waste; order
and peace succeeded lawlessness and war; and the blessings
of civilization succeeded the curses of savagery.</p>

<p>Not always are the "blessings" immediately recognized
for what they are, by their unconsulted recipients.</p>

<p>Certainly, in this case, there could be no two opinions
on the subject of whether the penetrated approved the
process. They were not altruists and they were fanatical
Mussulmans with an unfathomable contempt for all Christians
and all other God-forgotten Infidels.... Particularly was
this true of the Zaguigan dervishes, marabouts, mullahs,
priests, preachers, and teachers, for Zaguig was what is
known as a "Holy" City, and it was wont to make a most
unholy mess of any unauthorized intruder....</p>

<p>Probably Mecca and Medina themselves were not more
hopelessly reactionary and murderously fanatical than
Zaguig, and certainly they could not have approximated more
closely to the state of Sodom and Gomorrah than did this
Holy Spot....</p>

<p>However, the tide of civilization was encroaching upon
the hitherto undefiled sands that surrounded it; waves of
progress were lapping against its very walls; and the first
wavelets of that irresistible ocean were the men of Colonel
Levasseur's Military Mission.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>It was in this peculiarly unholy Holy City that Mary
met the man who instantly awoke her keenest interest,
admiration and approval; who later won her devoted love;
and ultimately became her husband.</p>

<p>Mary was&mdash;wholly unconsciously, I
believe&mdash;becoming very interested in the subject of
love and matrimony, and had, I feel sure, been wondering
whether her twin soul might not be right there, when she
sojourned in New York, London, Paris, Monte Carlo, Algiers,
Biskra, and Bouzen respectively, where charming eligibles
abounded.</p>

<p>To think that he should be in Zaguig where nothing
abounded but unwashed Zaguigans, heat, dirt, smells and an
almost unadulterated orientalism...!</p>

<p>I liked the handsome, hard, clean-cut Major Henri de
Beaujolais from the first; and he attracted me enormously.
To the simplicity and directness of the soldier he added
the cleverness and knowledge of the trained specialist; the
charm, urbanity and grace of the experienced man of the
world; and the inevitable attractiveness of a lovable and
modest character.</p>

<p>He combined the best of two nations, with his English
public-school upbringing, and his English home-life of
gentle breeding, on the one hand, and his aristocratic
French birth, breeding and traditions on the other....
I heard that he was as brave as a lion, extremely able,
and likely to go very far in his profession&mdash;quite
apart from the fact that he was the nephew of a most
distinguished general and related by marriage (through
his uncle's wife) to an extremely powerful and prominent
politician.</p>

<p>We first met him at dinner at Colonel Levasseur's table,
and I was surprised to note that Mary's attitude to him
was anything but encouraging and kind. In fact she rather
annoyed me by apparently endeavouring to annoy him. I taxed
her with this after he had gone, and asked if she disliked
him.</p>

<p>"<i>Dear</i> old Otis!" she smiled, and added later ...
"Why&mdash;no&mdash;why should I?... I altogether like him
... and <i>then</i> some ..."</p>

<p>"You certainly hid it," I observed, and,</p>

<p>"Did I?... Did I?" she asked.</p>

<p>Whereupon I also waxed wily, and remarked:</p>

<p>"He reminded me of d'Artagnan.... Just that swaggering
self-confidence and assurance ... a faint touch of the
somewhat gasconading swash-buckler ..." and got no
further.</p>

<p>"What!" interrupted Mary, "<i>Are</i> you as blind as a
mole with a monocle <i>and</i> as stupid as a fish with a
headache?... Why I never met a more modest unassuming
man in my life!... You couldn't prise a word out
of him&mdash;about what he has done.... Not with a
crow-bar...."</p>

<p>"Ah!" I observed profoundly, and chuckled, whereupon
Mary marched off to bed.</p>

<p>I love Mary, and I love to watch her at work. What she
wants, she goes for; and what she goes for, she gets. Our
Red Indian streak is, at times, fairly strong in her,
and shows particularly when she is in danger.... Then
she is the coolest thing invented, and apparently at
her happiest.... It shows also in a certain relentless
tenacity, a determination to achieve her purpose&mdash;and,
I may add, a certain recklessness&mdash;not to say
unscrupulousness&mdash;with which she handles obstacles and
opposition.</p>

<p>The idea that entered my mind that memorable evening
remained, and it turned to a certainty. As the days went
by, and Mary saw more and more of Henri de Beaujolais, she
grew more and more interested in him, and he in her.... All
his spare time was devoted to "making her visit agreeable,"
and to satisfying her insatiable thirst for knowledge of
North Africa and the Africans.</p>

<p>Poor Colonel Levasseur could but acquiesce, and show a
delight that he did not feel, when she assured him of how
enormously she was enjoying her stay in Zaguig&mdash;thanks
to Major de Beaujolais' wonderful knowledge of the place
and people, and his extraordinarily interesting way of
imparting it.</p>

<p>"Yes," thought I to myself in the vernacular, "Mary has
fallen for Major Henri de Beaujolais, and Major Henri de
Beaujolais has fallen for Mary&mdash;though possibly he
doesn't yet know it.... But he is certainly going to know
it&mdash;if the first part of my surmise is correct."</p>

<p>I was filled with hope and joy, for he was just the man
I would have chosen for my sister to marry, and I longed
to see her married and with a home of her own.... A woman
needs a home more than a man does&mdash;almost more than
she needs anything&mdash;and our own home in Wyoming was no
"home" at all....</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>It did not greatly surprise me, when, entering the
spacious tiled breakfast-room, with its great pillared
verandah, one morning, to hear de Beaujolais remark, as he
turned to go:</p>

<p>"Well, I have warned you, sir, and done all I can....
We're sitting on a powder-magazine and there are quite a
lot of lads inside it&mdash;<i>striking matches</i>.... And one
of them is our friend Selim ben Yussuf too!... There's
going to be a big explosion&mdash;and a conflagration as
well&mdash;and pretty soon...."</p>

<p>"Won't you stop and have some coffee ... before it
happens!..." smiled Colonel Levasseur in a particularly
irritating manner; and, with a haughty salute, de
Beaujolais strode from the room, his face set and
scowling.</p>

<p>"Wonderful noses for a mare's-nest, these Intelligence
people," smiled the Colonel. "Have you seen Mademoiselle
this morning?... Been out riding?... Wish I could find
all the spare time these Intelligence fellers can....
<i>I</i> can't go riding with her every morning.... Yes,
nothing but mare's-nest after mare's-nest, full of addled
eggs&mdash;like the Intelligence feller's brains.... Yes,
addled.... Another mare's-nest now&mdash;revolt, rebellion,
mutiny, murder, massacre and I don't know what all!...
I suppose the Secret Service must justify its existence
and earn its pay somehow.... <i>Intelligence</i>, eh?...
Pity some of them haven't got a little.... Ah! Here's
Mademoiselle.... Bring the coffee at once, Alphonse....
<i>Bon jour, ma chère Mademoiselle Vanbrugh,</i> you look like
the morning itself&mdash;only cool ... cool ... always
cool...."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>One afternoon within a week of the delivery of these
<i>obiter dicta</i> by the wise Colonel Levasseur, I received a
message, at the Residency, from de Beaujolais, bidding me
hurry to his quarters. The messenger, a fine Spahi, named
Achmet, de Beaujolais' orderly, calmly informed me that
my sister, the Sitt Miriam Vanbrugh, was in great danger
and that I was to go instantly, on the horse that he had
ridden. It appeared that de Beaujolais himself had come to
the Residency to find me, and had taken my sister's maid
away with him....</p>

<p>... At least this was what I gathered from Achmet's
curious mixture of French, <i>sabir</i> and Arabic.</p>

<p>I rushed down to the street, guided by Achmet, who ran
swiftly before me; rode to the house near the Bab-el-Sûq
where de Beaujolais lived, fearing I knew not what, and
noting the strange emptiness of the bazaars, lanes, squares
and streets, due, I supposed, to the fact that there
was a big parade and review in the great Square of the
Minaret....</p>

<p>Arrived at de Beaujolais' quarters, I dismounted in the
courtyard at the back of the house, gave the horse a smack
that sent him trotting to the stable, and dashed up the
wooden stairs. I either kicked down or opened the first
door to which I came, and found two Arabs in the room. One
of them announced himself to be Major de Beaujolais&mdash;I
recognized the voice after I had heard the name&mdash;and
said that Mary was in his bedroom with her maid, dressing
up as an Arab female.... The massacre was to be for that
evening, and not a foreigner would survive it, save those
who successfully hid themselves.... He had sent for me
to look after the girls and to share their chance of
escape by hiding, in disguise, until a punitive expedition
arrived....</p>

<p>So it had come!... De Beaujolais had been right and
Levasseur wrong, criminally wrong.... And Mary was in the
heart of one of the most dangerously fanatical towns in
the world, at the moment of a <i>jehad</i>, a Holy War upon
infidels, their slaughter and complete massacre.... Mary
and her excellent English maid, Maud Atkinson.... And I was
to disguise myself as an Arab and hide in a bedroom with
them&mdash;hide cowering, trembling, sickening, starving,
until the arrival of a relief-force from Ain-Zuggout or
somewhere!...</p>

<p>One thing was fairly certain, Mary wouldn't consent to
do anything of this sort&mdash;and I said so....</p>

<p>"What about the troops?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not a chance," replied de Beaujolais. "They are
hopelessly inadequate in number, and they couldn't be
worse placed than they are.... Scattered about the
city.... If you hide here, you'll be the only white people
alive by midnight.... It's absolutely your one and only
chance...."</p>

<p>"Mary won't stay hidden here for days," I said. "And I
don't like the idea much for myself, either.... Let's hear
what she's got to say about it," and we went into the next
room, followed by the other "Arab"&mdash;a Captain in the
French Secret Service, named Redon.</p>

<p>Mary, calm and cool as ever, appeared more interested
in the Arab clothes than in the prospect of death and
destruction.</p>

<p>"Look here, Mary," I said. "What about it? Will you
lie low here and keep the place all silent and shut up,
and wear those clothes in case anybody gets a glimpse of
you&mdash;and wait until the relief-force comes?"</p>

<p>"Answer's in the negative," she replied, observing
the effect of her head-dress in a shaving-mirror. "These
what-is-its over the face don't give a girl much chance,
do they?... The just and the unjust.... the fair and
the unfair ... all start from scratch, so to speak....
Er&mdash;no&mdash;Otis, I am not paying a long visit....
What's Major de Beaujolais going to do in the massacre?
Show great Intelligence and offer us sure, but Secret,
Service&mdash;or which?"</p>

<p>And then de Beaujolais made the devastating announcement
that he was going to clear out, cut and run&mdash;before
the show started, if he could.... He had at that moment got
his orders from the dirty, ruffianly-looking "Arab" who was
Captain de Redon....</p>

<p>And I, at that moment, got something too&mdash;the idea
of a lifetime! <i>He should take Mary with him</i>, wherever he
was going!... It would save her from the massacre, and it
would, moreover, throw her and de Beaujolais together in
the protracted intimacy of a desert journey.</p>

<p>And that would surely lead to the lasting happiness of
both of them!... In the imminence of battle, murder and
sudden death, I thought of orange-blossoms, bridal veils,
and the Voice that breathed o'er Eden.... I suppose it was
because I knew that it was hopeless and useless for me to
think of such things in connection with myself, that I so
often thought of them for other people....</p>

<p>And it promptly appeared that my bright idea had not
occurred to me alone, for Mary observed that since Major
de Beaujolais was escaping, she and her maid might as
well escape with him. She said it as one might say: "If
you're going to Town too, we might as well catch the same
train."</p>

<p>But de Beaujolais apparently had other views.</p>

<p>He declared that it was utterly impossible. He was going
on a secret mission of the greatest delicacy, danger and
importance.... He simply could not take women with him. He
repeated his suggestion that I and the two girls should lie
hidden in that house, and take our chance of surviving till
a French column arrived.</p>

<p>I was glad that Mary did not for one moment suppose that
I should do anything of the sort&mdash;do anything, in
fact, but join my host and his men and throw in my lot with
theirs.</p>

<p>For herself, she merely brushed de Beaujolais' refusals
and explanations aside, and made it clear that no masculine
trivialities and puerilities of politics, Secret Service,
or Special Missions, were of sufficient importance to be
talked about&mdash;much less considered as obstacles in the
path of Miss Mary Vanbrugh.</p>

<p>When he waxed urgently explanatory and emphatically
discouraging, finishing by an absolute and uncompromising
refusal, she merely did not listen, but bade the departing
Achmet to take along the portmanteau that Maudie had
brought&mdash;to wherever he was going....</p>

<p>And so extremely vehement and final was de Beaujolais'
negative, so absolutely convincing his reasons for refusing
to take her, that I was certain he longed to do it, and
was but fighting what he believed to be his own weakness.
I conceived him to be in the horrible position of having
to leave a girl, with whom he had fallen in love, to the
mercies of the men of Zaguig&mdash;or else take her with
him, to the greater danger to herself and the greatest
danger to the success of his mission....</p>

<p>To my mind, the second alternative was wholly
preferable, and I set about doing what I could to bring it
to pass&mdash;for it gave Mary not only a chance of life,
but a chance of happiness.... Also, I am bound to confess,
because it transferred to the broader shoulders of de
Beaujolais the terrible responsibility of saving her....</p>

<p>"Take her, for God's sake," I said, "it is her only
chance.... She will never hide here.... She'll come back to
the Residency with me, and use a rifle.... She is as good
as a man.... You say there is no shadow of hope.... Think
of the end then.... I can't shoot her.... There is at least
a chance for her with you...."</p>

<p>"Against my instructions and orders," he said, his face
a study of conflicting feelings.... "I have to travel as
light as possible; as swiftly as possible&mdash;and with
the irreducible minimum of followers.... More people means
more kit and camels ... more delay ... less speed....
And she'd never stand the journey.... Wholly against my
instructions and almost certain death for her...."</p>

<p>"And this is absolutely certain death for her," I
said.</p>

<p>I wished I could see Mary's face, but it was hidden
beneath the out-door garment that covers the <i>purdah</i>
Mussulman woman from the crown of her head to the soles
of her feet. Not even her eyes were visible through the
strip of muslin that covered the aperture left in the thick
material, to permit the wearer to see.</p>

<p>Captain de Redon added his voice to mine&mdash;evidently
sympathizing to the depths of his gallant Gallic soul with
his unfortunately-situated friend; with a girl in terrible
danger; and with the girl's brother, pleading for her life.
Probably he saw, as clearly as I did, that the one thing de
Beaujolais longed to do, was to give way....</p>

<p>And give way he did, with every appearance of reluctance
and ill grace.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "On Miss Vanbrugh's head be it.
She and her maid can leave with me&mdash;provided she
understands that my business is not to save her, but to
serve my country.... I shan't let her safety or life stand
in the way of duty, for a second...."</p>

<p>I wrung his hand and I knew that Mary was safe.... He'd
do his duty, all-right, but he'd make it square with the
safety of the woman he loved.... Yes, he certainly loved
her, whether he knew it or not&mdash;and a terrific load
was lifted from my mind.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>A few minutes later, they were all in the
street&mdash;still empty and silent, I was glad to
see&mdash;and on their way to the house of the wealthy
and friendly Arab, Sidi Ibrahim Maghruf&mdash;a party of
entirely ordinary and convincing natives; de Beaujolais,
a Sergeant-Major Dufour, Captain de Redon, Mary, and Maud
Atkinson&mdash;the last-named, in her invincible ignorance
and cheerful cockney courage, thoroughly enjoying the whole
business.</p>

<p>De Beaujolais refused to let me come with them to the
house of his friend Ibrahim Maghruf, where the caravan was
waiting, as I was not in Arab dress, and begged me (since I
refused to quit the town with him, and then take my chance
in the desert), to hurry back to the Residency. I was to
tell Colonel Levasseur of the arrival of Captain de Redon
with orders for de Beaujolais' instant departure, and to
try to get the fact into the good Colonel's thick skull
that the revolt would break out that very night....</p>

<p>I gave Mary a warm and loving embrace, kissed the place
where I imagined her mouth to be, and murmured in the
neighbourhood of her ear:</p>

<p>"God bless you, darling girl ..." and added a <i>cliché</i>
of our childhood anent "a buggy-ride with a nice young
man."</p>

<p>That Mary heard and understood my allusion was indicated
by the fact that I received an entirely perceptible jab in
the sub-central region of my waistcoat, as I took my arms
from about her neck.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Crushing down my feelings of loneliness, apprehension
and anxiety, I told myself that Mary was in splendid hands,
and, hurrying out from that boding and oppressive house,
I quickly lost myself, completely and hopelessly, in the
maze-like tangle of alleys, bazaars, winding lanes, and
crooked streets, that lay between it and the Residency.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the place was inexpressibly
sinister&mdash;sly, minatory and enigmatic. There was
no-one to be seen, but I felt that I was seen by a thousand
watching eyes.... What lurked behind those iron-barred
window-spaces, those lattices, gratings, slightly opened
doors; behind those high blind walls, and upon those
screened balconies?... Frequently the lane through which I
hurried was roofed completely over, and was a mere tunnel
beneath the upper rooms of the houses that formed its
sides.</p>

<p>As I emerged from one of these and turned a corner into
a narrow bazaar of tiny shops, each but a shuttered hole in
the wall, I heard a heavy murmur such as one may suddenly
hear when approaching the sea-shore and emerging into the
open....</p>

<p>It was indescribably menacing and disturbing, this
growing noise as of a hive of infuriated bees, and
it quickly grew into the most terrible sound there
is&mdash;the blended roar and howl and shout and scream
of a vast infuriated mob of maddened men, yelling and
blood-lusting for rapine, fire and slaughter.... The man
who can hear it unmoved is a man of iron nerve, a superman
indeed&mdash;for a mob is infinitely worse and wickeder,
more destructive and dangerous, than any single member of
it. It is the most wild and savage of all wild and savage
beasts; and is infinitely powerful, with its innumerable
hands to rend and slay and burn, its innumerable brains to
think of evil things for those hands to do.</p>

<p>I was certainly frightened.</p>

<p>The appalling noise increased in volume and came
nearer.</p>

<p>I was lost&mdash;and knew not which way to turn to
avoid the mob nor to rejoin my friends, those splendid
soldiers&mdash;many of them Africans&mdash;who would die to
a man, without thought of parley or surrender.</p>

<p>To die fighting with them would be nothing&mdash;an
exhilaration, a fierce joy&mdash;but to be torn to pieces
in these stinking gutters, handled and struck by these
foul bestial brutes, trampled to a jelly of blood and mud
and mess ... there could be no more dreadful death.... The
loathsome indignity of it&mdash;a white man struggling
impotent in the hands of blacks&mdash;his clothes torn from
his body...!</p>

<p>That was what frightened me, not Death&mdash;for he
was a fellow I was quite willing to meet whenever he came
along.... </p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p> As the noise made by the mob&mdash;the noise varying
from the roaring of ten thousand lions to that of a
mighty sea breaking on an iron-bound coast in a terrific
storm&mdash;rose and fell, advanced and withdrew, when I
turned corners, entered narrow gullies or crossed open
squares, I prayed that Mary was out of the city and safely
on her way.</p>

<p>I fervently blessed de Beaujolais and his thought for
her; his fetching her maid and me; his final decision to
take her with him. I could not refrain from contrasting him
with Levasseur&mdash;who had invited her to Zaguig that he
might impress her and that she might see him in the most
favourable conditions.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;he had invited her to Zaguig for his own ends
and had so been instrumental in bringing de Beaujolais into
her life. Long might de Beaujolais remain there!</p>

<p>And suddenly I turned another corner and found, with
utter dismay, that I had walked round in a circle; for in
the open space where several lanes met, lay a dead horse
that I had seen an hour or two earlier, and, not very far
from it, lay the corpse of an Arab.</p>

<p>The sight&mdash;an unpleasant one&mdash;of the man's
body, gave me an idea. My object was to rejoin Levasseur
and to be of use; but it was absolutely certain that I
should never reach him in European clothes. I should be
torn to pieces by the mob, killed by the first gang I ran
into. Dressed as I was, my one chance of life was to creep
into some hole and hide. Dressed as an Arab, I might make
my way to the Residency, and get into it&mdash;if I were
not shot by its defenders.</p>

<p>Disguised as an Arab, I might be able to approach and
shout, in French, that I was one of them. Dressed as a
European, I couldn't shout to the mob that I was really an
Arab in disguise&mdash;and get away with it. There wouldn't
be time to shout, for one thing.</p>

<p>The dead man's clothes were filthy, and they were soaked
in blood. He had certainly been in bad trouble.... Could he
be another Secret Service man, like de Redon? One who had
fallen by the way? I should somehow feel less compunction
about putting on his foul <i>burnous</i>, if he were.... Should
I put his things on over my own, or discard European
clothing entirely?... I should have to look "right" about
the head and feet, anyway. There wouldn't be much point in
going about with European boots and trousers sticking out
at one end of a <i>burnous</i> and a European sun-helmet at the
other.</p>

<p>But what should I look like, if a gang came round the
corner, and saw me sitting in the gutter, swapping clothes
with a corpse?</p>

<p>These thoughts flashed through my mind in the moment
that I reached the body. Apparently the man had been
stabbed, or run through, with a sword.</p>

<p>He had bled very copiously, and I glanced at the trail
which connected him with the gate of a compound.... No, I
couldn't squat down in the open street, pull off my boots
and trousers&mdash;fancy being caught without one's boots
and trousers&mdash;and change clothes with a corpse!... Or
could I?...</p>

<p>And right here the corpse fetched a deep groan and
settled the question. I could not pull the clothes off a
dying man.... If I could do nothing to help him, I could at
least leave him to die in peace.</p>

<p>I turned and hurried away, wondering which of the five
streets that entered the square was the one by which I
had followed Achmet from the Residency to de Beaujolais'
quarters. They all looked alike to me, and I had been too
anxious about Mary to take any note of the winding route
by which we had come.... I found that I was following the
trail left by the wounded Arab, and saw that it led into
the compound of an apparently unoccupied building, and to
the foot of an outside stair-case that went up to the flat
roof.</p>

<p>As I halted, there was a sudden burst of nearer noise,
the sound of men running as well as shouting; and, glancing
over my shoulder, I saw that, two or three hundred yards
from where I stood, a mob was streaming across the end of
the alley down which I was looking. Any one of the running
men might at any moment glance in my direction&mdash;and in
a very few minutes it would be, "Good-evening, St. Peter,"
for mine.</p>

<p>I dashed into the compound, up the stairs to the roof,
and found myself in the presence of some half-dozen
Arabs&mdash;all dead....</p>

<p>"Dirty work at the cross-roads!"</p>

<p>The place was like a butcher's yard, a
slaughter-house&mdash;also a perfectly private
dressing-room provided with an assortment of that kind
of fancy-dress of which I was in such desperate need.
The garments were all filthy, more or less torn, and
plentifully bloodstained; but I realized that this was all
to the good, since my object was to make my way through
streets swarming with the scum of the city, similarly
apparelled, and many of them similarly gore-bespattered. In
point of fact it was amazing good luck that I had happened
upon this sinister and revolting shambles.</p>

<p>Promptly I divested myself of my outer clothing and
boots, and got to work.</p>

<p>It was the nastiest job I have ever undertaken, and
there were moments when I was tempted to resume my own
clothes, take one of the Arab swords that lay about, and
run amok. Still more was I tempted to scurry back to de
Beaujolais' quarters and hide.... I could find the place by
returning to where the dead horse lay....</p>

<p>I suppose that if I were a strong silent man with a big
chin (and a thick ear or two), I should have proceeded
coolly and swiftly with my task, and should have swaggered
forth from that house "every inch an Arab," correct to the
last detail.</p>

<p>In point of fact I felt ill and shaken; I was very
frightened and nervous; and I could scarcely control my
trembling sweating fingers.</p>

<p>Possibly most other ordinary people would have felt
nearly as bad as I did?</p>

<p>It was growing dark.... The sky was lurid with the
glare of great conflagrations.... There was a ceaseless
nerve-shattering mob-roar, a roar punctuated by hideous
howls, rifle shots, and the crashes of volley-firing....
I was in the midst of a select assembly of corpses, and
their hideous faces seemed to grimace in the waning and
flickering light.... I had to pull them about, to get their
clothes from them&mdash;their beastly blood-sodden clothes
... and they resented this, and clung to their rags with
devilish ingenuity.... And there was viscous slimy blood
upon my hands.... There were knotted strings&mdash;and the
knots would not come undone&mdash;and this made the owner
of the garment grin and grin and grin at me, and shake his
horrible head as I tugged and tugged, the perspiration
streaming from me.... And once stepping back, I slipped and
stumbled and, in saving myself from falling, I trod upon
the chest of a man lying behind me, and my weight drove
the air from his lungs through his throat, and the dead
uttered what seemed a loud cry&mdash;the ghastliest, the
most loathsome, the most terrifying sound that I have ever
heard: the dead voice of a dead man raised in loud protest
against the indignity, the defilement of my treading
foot....</p>

<p>I hear that sound in nightmares to this day....</p>

<p>From that man I took nothing, though I coveted his
<i>burnous</i> and great curved dagger.... I dared not touch
him, lest his dreadful glazed eyes turn to mine, his
horrible snarling mouth shout at me again, his dead hands
seize me by the throat....</p>

<p>Yes, I was certainly frightened by the time I had
wrested a complete Arab outfit from those reluctant
corpses, and I was certainly sick by the time I had rubbed
a mud of blood and dust and dirt upon my hands and arms, my
feet and legs and&mdash;it makes me shudder to think of it
even now&mdash;upon my face....</p>

<p>Having dressed, I wound a filthy cotton thing about
my neck, chin, mouth, nose and ears, almost to my eyes,
beneath the head-cloth I had transferred complete from its
late owner's head and shoulders to my own; picked up a
knife and a sword; and fled from the horrible scene of my
unspeakable labours.</p>

<p>As I emerged from the compound, a man dashed from a
side-turning into the alley in front of me, and came
running swiftly in my direction.</p>

<p>I raised my sword and waited, realizing that my ghastly
work up above must, at any rate, have made a terrible
spectacle of me, and that standing there, bloody, grim,
silent, well-armed, I was scarcely likely to be attacked by
one man&mdash;nor by any number, until I had to speak, or
my disguise was penetrated....</p>

<p>The running man drew near, and I saw that he was a
filthy ragged creature, gaunt and wild, carrying a great
staff in one hand and a rosary in the other. Flecks of foam
lay in white spots on his mangy beard.... One of those
bestial "holy" beggars, so full of divinity that there is
no room for humanity....</p>

<p>As he rushed by, a few yards from me, he glanced in my
direction, took me for a fellow tough, and yelled something
or other, in Arabic&mdash;a profession of faith or an
incitement to slay and spare not&mdash;and I got a clear
glimpse of his face.</p>

<p>It was Captain de Redon.</p>

<p>Dashing after him, I laid my hand on his arm, raised
my sword and emitted a meaningless howl. He swung about,
cursing me vehemently, and up went his long staff. He
looked as pleasant and easy to tackle as a hungry grizzly
bear.... And he did not know me&mdash;nor dream that I was
anything but the Arab thing I was trying to appear.</p>

<p>"This one's on you, Captain," I remarked.</p>

<p>His staff and his jaw both dropped as he stared.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" he said. "Who are you?... I thought I was
the only..."</p>

<p>"Otis H. Vanbrugh," I told him. "Major de Beaujolais
introduced us an hour ago."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" he said again.... "But you have made good
use of your time, Monsieur! You took me in completely....
What happened?... I am going back to de Beaujolais'
quarters to see that everything is all-right.... No papers
undestroyed.... He had to leave rather hurriedly.... And I
want another bite of Christian food, for I'm starving....
Also a scrap of soap if I can find some.... Very useful for
pious foaming at the mouth...."</p>

<p>As we hurried along, I told him how I had lost my way
in trying to get from de Beaujolais' quarters to the
Residency, and of my finding the dead men on the roof.</p>

<p>"A queer business," he said. "But corpses will be
sufficiently common before to-morrow.... And your idea is
to rejoin Levasseur and take a hand?... You'll have to be
careful. It would be bad luck to get through the mob safely
and be shot by the Zouaves....</p>

<p>"Your sister is safely away," he continued, and went on
to tell me how he had accompanied de Beaujolais' party to
one of the gates, and had been able to divert a mob from
that quarter, lead them running to imaginary loot, and, by
dashing round a corner and over a wall and through a house
and garden that he knew, to get into one of the tunnel-like
bazaars and shake them off.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd better stick to me for a while," he
concluded, as we entered de Beaujolais' place. "If anybody
speaks to you, howl and hit him.... Sure sign that your
heart's in the right place and that you're feeling good
to-day&mdash;nice and fanatical and anti-French.... We'll
get as near to the Residency as we can without being shot,
and I may be able to get you in.... If not, you'll have to
manage it, somehow, to-night.... Call out in French and
say that you want to speak to Levasseur.... It'll be a
risky business for you, though, between the Arabs and the
Zouaves...."</p>

<p>"But aren't you going to join your comrades too?" I
asked. "The one of us that got in first could warn them
to look out for the other&mdash;if we failed to get in
together."</p>

<p>"No," replied de Redon. "My job is outside. I'm going
to play around with the lads-of-the-village, and speak
that which is not true.... Just when they are going to
start something, I yell that a French army is round the
corner.... Or I accidentally drop this club on top of the
head of the most prominent citizen, at the moment of his
maximum usefulness to the community he adorns.... Dupe and
mislead the poor fellows as effectually as if I were a
professional labour-agitator, in fact...."</p>

<p>I liked this Captain de Redon, a cool, competent and
most courageous person. As he ate the leg of a fowl, and
swiftly searched the two rooms that de Beaujolais had
occupied&mdash;presumably for papers or other traces of its
late occupant&mdash;he chatted as though we were not both
in imminent danger of a beastly death, and about to go out
and look for it.</p>

<p>It was a most interesting and amusing thing to hear a
cultured and very delightful voice, speaking excellent
English, issue from that dirty ragged scarecrow, skinny,
mean and repulsive-looking.</p>

<p>Gazing at him in some amazement, I had an idea, and went
to a small framed mirror, a cheap bazaar article, that hung
on the wall of the back room.</p>

<p>I was positively startled. Sick and sorry as I had
been at the time, I had done my work well&mdash;and had
so smeared the handful of blood, mud, dust and dirt into
my face and eyes that there was not a vestige of my white
(or red) skin exposed. The said face was a most revolting,
bestial, and disgusting spectacle&mdash;barely human in
its foul filthiness.... No wonder that de Redon had not
recognized me nor dreamed that I was a Christian.... As
I stared at myself, I was glad that Isobel could not see
me.</p>

<p>"Ready?" said de Redon, in the doorway.... "Excuse my
rushing you.... We'll get as near the Residency as we
can.... When we're among the simple villagers, you just
follow me and do more or less what I do.... If anybody
seems offensive or gets inquisitive, hit him&mdash;or else
spin round and round, and howl.... And, look here&mdash;if
we get in front of the troops, throw yourself on the ground
and be a wounded man.... If you go running towards them
dressed like that, you'll be shot or bayoneted.... Wait
for a chance to crawl near enough to shout, in French, to
Levasseur or an officer, as I said...."</p>

<p>I thanked him and forbore to remark that I had played
Red Indians before&mdash;and with tame Indians who had
themselves trodden the war-path in their time.</p>

<p>We went down into the street and hurried in the
direction of the big square, not far from which was the
Residency.</p>

<p>De Redon evidently knew every inch of the route, each
twist and turn, and he went so fast that I could only just
keep him in sight as he kept vanishing round corners and
into dark tunnels.</p>

<p>Every moment the horrible noise grew louder and louder
as we came nearer to the scene of the fighting.</p>

<p>As we turned from a foul gully into a broader street,
a gang of looters came running round a corner a few yards
from us.</p>

<p>Waving his staff and rosary of black wooden beads, de
Redon howled like a wild beast, and spun round and round,
shouted something I could not understand, and dashed
on&mdash;I at his heels, in the middle of the yelling and
excited Arabs. They had evidently come into the city from
the outside, being differently dressed from the townsmen,
darker and hardier-looking toughs.</p>

<p>Some had long guns and some carried perfectly good
rifles.</p>

<p>The street down which we ran, debouched into the big
market-square, the Square of the Minaret, and this great
place was packed almost solid with people, all moving in
the direction of the Residency. Certainly "the heathen
raged furiously together," and when we got fairly into the
middle of them, I began to feel that it was as safe a place
as any, so far as risk of discovery went, and I yelled and
waved my sword with the best.</p>

<p>De Redon wriggled, thrust, and fought his way through
the crowd aggressively, and with the air of an important
person who has very urgent business in hand. In an
exceedingly violent and truculent assembly of fanatical
ruffians, he seemed the most violent, truculent and
fanatical of the lot. I followed him as best I could, and
endeavoured to behave as he did.</p>

<p>Suddenly the shouting crowd gave back, just as crowds do
when shepherded by mounted police, and, in a few moments,
de Redon and I found ourselves in the foremost ranks, and
then in front, and ahead of the mob. Turning to face the
swaying crowd, de Redon twirled his stall above his head
and bawled in Arabic at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>"Back! Back!... Run! Run!... The Roumi dogs ... the
<i>Franzawi</i> are coming ..." and pointed to where from
a side-street, a detachment of Zouaves came charging
at the double&mdash;stoned and shot-at from the roofs,
and followed by a howling mob, only kept at bay by the
rear-guard-action tactics of a Sergeant, who, every now and
then, halted the end squad of the little column, turned
them about, fired a volley, and rushed back to the main
body, who slowed up during the operation.</p>

<p>Occasionally a soldier fell and was instantly the centre
of a surging mob that slashed and tore and clubbed him
almost out of semblance to the human form.</p>

<p>As the little column, evidently fighting its way to
the Residency, debouched into the square, the officer in
command, a young Lieutenant, charging at their head, threw
up his sword-hand and shouted:</p>

<p>"<i>Halte!... Cessez le feu!... Formez le carré!</i>"</p>

<p>And, in an instant, the company was a square, bristling
with bayonets, steady as a rock, front ranks kneeling, rear
ranks standing close behind them, awaiting the next order
as if at drill.</p>

<p>"Run! Run! My brothers!" yelled de Redon, in the
comparative quiet that followed this manoeuvre, a slight
lull before the storm.</p>

<p>"Run! Run!... The <i>Franzawi</i>!... We shall be slain!" and
he dashed at the wavering crowd that hung uncertain whether
to charge in holy triumph or flee in holy terror.</p>

<p>Following his voice came that of the French officer,
full, clear and strong.</p>

<p>"<i>Attention! Pour les feux de salve!... En joue!...</i>"</p>

<p>"Quick! Quick!... Run! Run ..." yelled de Redon.</p>

<p>A huge man, wearing the green turban of a <i>haji</i>, and
bearing aloft a green banner, thrust through the crowd,
sprang forward, sent de Redon sprawling and yelled:</p>

<p>"<i>Allah! Allah! Allah Akbar!... Fissa! Fissa!</i>... Follow
me and die for the Faith...."</p>

<p>The crowd howled in response and moved forward.</p>

<p>De Redon, apparently representing a different brand of
holiness, and full of the <i>odium theologicum</i>, returned
the violent assault of the <i>haji</i>. He returned it with his
club. The <i>haji</i> dropped, and the subsequent proceedings
interested him no more.</p>

<p>The crowd rushed forward.</p>

<p>"<i>Feu!</i>" shouted the Zouave officer, and either
instinctively or because de Redon did so, I flung myself to
the ground.</p>

<p><i>Crash!</i>... rang out the volley of the Zouaves.</p>

<p>"<i>En joue! Feu!</i>" cried the officer.</p>

<p><i>Crash!</i> came the second volley from all sides of the
now surrounded square of troops.</p>

<p>The crowd about me scattered like leaves before the
wind, and de Redon and I were two of dozens of motionless
figures upon the ground.</p>

<p>"<i>Garde â vous!</i>" cried the officer.... "<i>Par files de
quatre!... Pas gymnastique!... En avant!...</i>"</p>

<p>Before he could give the order, "<i>Marche!</i>" a great
voice boomed forth from above our heads, as though from
Heaven.</p>

<p>On a little balcony at the top of a needle-like minaret,
appeared the <i>muezzin</i>, and, on a clarion note, fairly
trumpeted forth the words:</p>

<p>"<i>Kill! Kill!... In the name of Allah!... Gazi! Gazi!...
There is no god but God and Mahomet is His Prophet!...
Slay! Slay!... Charge together, in the Name of Allah!...
Burn!... Destroy!... Kill! Kill!...</i>"</p>

<p>The mob rallied and from every street, alley, courtyard
and doorway poured forth again in hundreds.</p>

<p>"<i>Charge!</i>" boomed forth again the great voice of the
mullah.</p>

<p><i>Bang!</i> went a rifle and, as I glanced from the figure
of the Iman toward the sound, I saw the Sergeant lower his
rifle.</p>

<p>"<i>Marche!</i>" continued the officer, even as the body of
the <i>muezzin</i> struck the parapet of his eyrie, reeled over
it and crashed into the courtyard below.</p>

<p>A terrific yell went up from the vast crowd, and many
rushed to the spot, while others turned to pursue the
Zouaves, now retreating at the double.</p>

<p>In front of the following crowd, a recumbent figure
sprang to its feet, and with extended hand and every
appearance of tremendous excitement, pointed away to the
opposite corner of the square.</p>

<p>"Beware! Beware!" he shouted. "A trap! A trap!...
Danger!... Big guns! Cannon! <i>Boom! Boom!</i>... Run!
Run!..."</p>

<p>Bewildered and excited eyes turned in the direction to
which de Redon pointed.</p>

<p>"Follow me!" he shouted, and ran toward the nearest
street.</p>

<p>I sprang up and dashed after him, waving my sword and
yelling, "<i>La illah ill allah ill Allah!</i>"</p>

<p>It seemed to me as good a noise as any, and quite
fashionable at the moment&mdash;in fact, literally <i>le
dernier cri</i>.</p>

<p>As always happens when a mob is given a lead, a large
number followed, and, though de Redon's heroic effort did
not prevent pursuit of the soldiers, it delayed it, as our
section of the crowd streamed across the front of those who
were dashing forward to avenge the death of the holy man
who, with his last breath, had incited them to rapine and
slaughter.</p>

<p>Keeping as near de Redon as I could, I galloped along
behind him, waving my sword and emitting appropriate
noises.</p>

<p>Into a side alley dashed de Redon still yelling:</p>

<p>"Big guns! Cannon! Machine-guns!... The French army! The
French army!... Fly! Fly!" and in a minute it was filled
from end to end with the surging rushing river of our
followers, each man running because everybody else did.</p>

<p>Out into another street we turned, and into yet another
and another, and along them kept the uneven tenor of our
way, until before us appeared a city gate, leading out into
the desert.</p>

<p>Toward this we streamed, some of us yelling, <i>"Kill!"</i>
others, "<i>Fly!...</i>" others, "<i>Franzawi! Franzawi!...</i>" some
in search of secular salvation, others the salvation of
their souls and life-everlasting, through the slaughter of
the Infidel.</p>

<p>Through the gate thundered the yelling mob and, as the
inevitable moment approached when those who run begin to
ask, "What precisely <i>are</i> we running for?" de Redon began
to slacken his pace, drop back into the crowd, and to edge
toward the side.</p>

<p>Snatching at my wrist as he did so, he turned about,
dropped into a walk, and, a moment later, limped lamely and
blindly into a yard-wide opening between two high native
houses.</p>

<p>Excited and hurried out of my normal poise and dignified
deportment of a perfect little gentleman, I was moved, for
no particular reason, to smite him with the flat of my
sword where the seat of his trousers should have been, and
to hound him along with such opprobrious epithets as I had
learned.</p>

<p>"Quicker! Quicker! Misbegotten son of a dog!" I howled;
and belaboured the poor half-blind tottering creature in
the best Oriental manner.</p>

<p>We rounded a corner, and de Redon laughing heartily,
straightened up.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" he said. "But I'll borrow the sword and
drive <i>you</i>, next time.... Splendid!" he gasped....</p>

<p>"Now we'll cut in ahead of Bouchard and his Zouaves
and try to get you into the Residency with them.... Come
on...." and he started running again.</p>

<p>We turned a corner and ran into a gang of looters.</p>

<p>Some were yelling, wrangling, squabbling, in front of a
house, while others appeared to be literally turning the
house inside out.</p>

<p>As a bed, fittings and occupant complete, came flying
over a balcony, de Redon executed a number of those
dance-steps which had already won my admiration, while
defying emulation so far as I was concerned.</p>

<p>Scarcely slackening his pace, he spun round and round
like a top, whooping fiendishly. This interested the
looters not at all, and we passed on unmolested&mdash;my
immediate wonder being whether the occupant of the
deciduous bed were an invalid, and my immediate decision
being that at any rate he soon would be....</p>

<p>Turning again and dashing through a narrow stinking
close, we heard a dreadful scream, that pierced the more
distant din of the shouting and fighting.</p>

<p>In a dark and deeply-recessed porch, the back of which
was an open door, a man stood with one foot on the breast
of a child&mdash;a little girl, whose skinny arm he
appeared to be turning and twisting from her body in his
effort to secure the wide thick armlet of silver, which was
apparently too small to pass the elbow.</p>

<p>I have to testify that de Redon was into that doorway
before I was.</p>

<p>Turning with a fierce snarl the brute snatched a great
knife from his sash, as de Redon, unable to swing his staff
up, used it like a spear. The end of the staff went home
with a pleasant thud, and drove the man sprawling back
against the wall.</p>

<p>Raising the knife, he sprang at de Redon, seizing the
staff in his left hand as he did so; and I simultaneously
swiped the brute with my heavy sword.</p>

<p>It was the first time in my life that I had struck a
man in anger, and I did it unskillfully ... so unskilfully
that, though he had every cause for complaint, he had no
opportunity. The sword was so sharp and heavy, and wrath
and indignation had so nerved my arm, that I had split his
skull and killed him dead as a door-nail.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" observed de Redon, as the man went down,
taking the sword with him. "Don't you hit me with that
sword any more."</p>

<p>Picking up the sobbing child, I lifted her inside the
heavy door, and shut her in the house.</p>

<p>"Papa and the men-servants all gone to the fair,
I suppose," observed de Redon, as we ran on down the
alley....</p>

<p>This same alley became a tunnel which led into a
small square. As we came out into this, the noise became
terrific, and, looking down a narrow bazaar which joined it
to a main street, we saw that this latter was packed with a
dense crowd of armed men all streaming along past the end
of it.</p>

<p>"Bouchard will never do it," said de Redon, slowing up.
"He should have stayed where he was posted.... Perhaps they
burnt him out, though....</p>

<p>"Look here," he continued, "if you turn to the right at
the end of this bazaar, I expect you'll know where you are.
It leads straight to the Residency.... Suppose you try to
get in, and let Levasseur know what's happening.... Tell
him Bouchard is fighting his way from the market-square
to the Residency, and that I say he'll need help. Then
Levasseur can use his own discretion as to whether to make
a sortie.... I'll go along with the crowd and try the
'French-Army-with-cannon-behind-you' game again.... Good
luck, <i>mon ami</i>.... If anyone interferes with you, give
him one like you gave our late friend in the doorway....
Good-bye...."</p>

<p>And those were the last words spoken to me by Captain
Raoul d'Auray de Redon of the French Secret Service.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, old chap, and good luck," I said, and, a
minute later, we were into the crowd, de Redon attracting
all the attention he could by whooping, twirling his staff,
spinning round and round, and howling like the demented
dervish he was impersonating.</p>

<p>I, on the contrary, hugging the wall, made my way along
in the opposite direction as unobtrusively as possible, and
attracted no attention. It struck me as I dodged, elbowed,
pushed and evaded the impulsive pedestrian traffic,
that, in a way, a fugitive is a good deal safer in time
of tremendous public uproar and disturbance than during
profound peace, inasmuch as everybody is far too excited to
be observant.</p>

<p>Anyhow, not a soul molested me as I went along
muttering, gesticulating and foaming at the mouth. It is
a curious fact that I did not taste the fragment of soap
which I had placed beneath my tongue. </p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p> In a few minutes, the throng thinned and slackened
and I found that this crowd had detached itself from
the outskirts of the vaster one that surrounded the
Residency.</p>

<p>Here I made quicker progress, and eventually came, at a
run, into a dense mob that filled the street and faced in
the direction in which I was going.</p>

<p>Backward and forward they moved, as the front ranks
advanced and retired, and into these front ranks I could
only make my way by clinging tight to posts, throwing
myself down against walls, or diving into doorways,
whenever the mob was driven back.</p>

<p>At last I was where I wanted to be, and looked upon a
stirring scene of battle, murder and sudden death.</p>

<p>A regular siege of the Residency was in progress, a
siege enlivened by constant assault.</p>

<p>From every window, balcony, roof-top, wall, minaret,
tower, doorway and street corner, a steady fusillade
concentrated upon the building, while, every now and then,
a great company of wild death-seeking fanatics rushed at
the low wall that surrounded its compound, only to break
and wither beneath the blast of the steady rifle-fire of
the defenders, and to find the death they sought.</p>

<p>Crisp and timely, crash upon crash, came the volleys
from the treble tier of fire of the troopers at the wall,
the windows and the roof. Wave after wave swept forward and
broke upon that steady rock, throwing up a white spray, as
survivors of the ordeal-by-fire sprang on the low wall, and
the bayonets of the French soldiers.</p>

<p>And, the whole time, a ceaseless rain of bullets
struck the house, so that it was in a nimbus of its own
dust&mdash;a kind of halo of its own glory and suffering,
as each bullet registered its impact with a puff of
whitewash, dust and powdered brick....</p>

<p>How to get in there?...</p>

<p>From the surrounding wall, from every window and
balcony, and from the parapet of the flat roof, the rifles
of the defenders cracked unceasingly. It would be plain and
simple suicide to advance openly, dressed as I was, and it
would be suicide of a more unpleasant kind to strip off my
Arab head-dress and <i>burnous</i>, and so proclaim myself a
Christian.</p>

<p>Edging along the walls of houses, crawling on all fours,
dashing from doorway to doorway and shelter to shelter,
I gradually made my way from among those who played a
comparatively safe and waiting rôle&mdash;onlookers who
would turn to looting murderers as soon as the wall was
cleared, and the doors beaten in&mdash;until I was among
the fighting fanatics who made the frequent hand-to-hand
attacks upon the low wall, the wall that must be captured
before the house could be set on fire or taken by
assault.</p>

<p>There was a hellish din from the hundreds of guns and
rifles banging in all directions, and the continuous animal
howling of the mob.</p>

<p>It would have been impossible in this inferno to hear
what anybody said, and the wild rushes that broke upon the
wall were the outcome of herd instinct and mob-intuition
rather than of any definite organization, orders and
leading.</p>

<p>Suddenly everybody would dash forward, the mouth of
every street vomit hundreds and hundreds of men, and a
great sword-waving mob would surge across the open, hack
and hew and slash as it reached the wall, waver and fall
back&mdash;and then turn and run for dear life to the
lanes, alleys, buildings and compounds from which it
came.</p>

<p>And, each time, the litter of dead and wounded increased
and lay ever thicker along the wall. Soon the besiegers
would be able to charge straight over the wall on a ramp of
bodies....</p>

<p>From where I crouched in a deep gutter, my head and
shoulders behind a stone post or mounting-block, I could
see two sides of the Residency, and did not doubt that it
was under heavy fire on its two garden sides.</p>

<p>As I watched and cast about in my mind for a plan,
the strange psychology of mobs decreed another sudden
simultaneous assault, and I found myself running and
yelling with the best&mdash;or the worst&mdash;in a
desperate charge upon the desperately defended wall.</p>

<p>Let it not be supposed that I displayed heroism or
strove to find a hero's grave. Far from it. I displayed
such prudence as was possible, to avoid getting into the
front rank of the rush, and rather strove to keep a hero's
body between me and the rifles as we ran. And when at last
I reluctantly found myself bounding over the prostrate
forms of those behind whom I had hitherto been sheltered,
I promptly joined them in their biting of the dust, until
a living wall of humanity was once more between me and the
wall of stone.</p>

<p>Leaping to my feet again, I made another rush at the
spot where the fighting-line was thickest and cast myself
at the feet of the brave.</p>

<p>Of the feet of the brave I soon had more than
sufficient, for they were planted heavily on every portion
of my person, as the un-led unorganized hordes again
retreated.</p>

<p>Left high and dry by this ebbing tide of horny-hoofed
humanity, I found myself within a few feet of the wall, and
one of hundreds of motionless, or writhing and twitching
bodies.</p>

<p>Of the defenders of the wall I could see nothing save
their gleaming bayonet-tips, the occasional <i>képi</i> of
someone who ran crouching along, and the heads of watchful
sentries placed at intervals.</p>

<p>A moving cap halted, rose slowly upward and a man looked
over the wall.</p>

<p>Now was my chance.</p>

<p>Raising myself on my hands, I shouted:</p>

<p>"<i>Hi! Monsieur! Je suis Americain!... Je suis un ami!...
Aidez-moi!... Je viens...</i>"</p>

<p>And down I flopped with the utmost alacrity as the
worthy man, with a swift neatness, theoretically quite
admirable, drew and fired an automatic pistol.</p>

<p>Though he had drawn and fired practically in one
movement, his aim was extraordinarily good, for the bullet
hit the ground within an inch of my head.</p>

<p>I believe I gave an excellent rendering of the rôle of a
dead Arab.</p>

<p>And I decided to play this easy part until there were
again some braver men than I, between myself and that wall.
Nor did I have long to wait.</p>

<p>With a howl that seemed to achieve the impossible
by drowning all other sounds, the mob charged again,
materializing with astonishing swiftness, and in astounding
numbers.</p>

<p>A shout, a whistle, a sharp order ... the wall was lined
with heads and rifles ... and I fairly burrowed into the
filthy dust with my nose, as a volley crashed out ... again
... again ... and I felt as though I should be blown away
upon the blast....</p>

<p>With my hands protecting my head, I endured the rush and
trample for a few seconds; and then, with a bound and the
record sprint of my life, I flung myself at the base of the
wall, as a rifle seemed to blow my head off, and a bayonet
tore my filthy <i>kafieh</i> just beside my neck.</p>

<p>As I fell and snuggled into the friendly base of that
lovely wall, I thought I was blind and deaf and probably
dumb, or "alternatively," as the lawyers say, quite
completely dead.</p>

<p>Quickly, however, I decided that none of these things
was so, as I could see filthy feet and brawny brown legs
scuffling around me, and hear the sounds of combat, and
shout a curse when a charging, bounding <i>ghazi</i> landed
fairly on my stomach, and, for a few minutes, that seemed
like a few hours, I was kicked, trampled, trodden and
struck until I was almost driven to spring up and take my
chance at the wall ...</p>

<p>And suddenly I was free, and the feet that had trampled
me, were either once more in headlong flight, or else
stilled in death.</p>

<p>Free also I was to make all the row I wished, in French,
and to tear off my Arab head-dress and reveal myself to
whomsoever would lend me his ears....</p>

<p>But I remembered the shoot-first-and-ask-afterward
gentleman with the automatic, and restrained my inclination
to poke my head over the wall.</p>

<p>Something had to go over the wall, however, so I lifted
up my voice and started, more or less tunefully, to bawl in
French, a version of a song which I had very often heard on
the lips of Colonel Levasseur, and the tune of which I had
often heard soldiers singing and whistling on the march. In
point of fact, Major de Beaujolais had picked it out on the
piano and sung it at Mary's request after dinner only last
night&mdash;the Marching-Song of the Legion ... </p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Tiens voilà du boudin! voilà du boudin! voilà du boudin!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pour les Alsaciens, les Suisses et les Lorraines; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pour les Belges il n'y en a point,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pour les Belges il n'y en a point,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Car ce sont des tireurs au flanc.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pour les Belges il n'y en a point,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pour les Belges il n'y en a point,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Car ce sont des tireurs au flanc."</p>

<br>

<p>I sang, or rather shouted, and I was heard.</p>

<p>A head suddenly appeared over the wall.... Hell! It was
my friend of the automatic, and most markedly I did not
move.</p>

<p>"<i>Tiens!</i>" I cried. <i>"Voyez!</i> and also <i>Regardez!</i> and
<i>Ecoutez!</i> and all that, <i>et ne tirez pas</i>. Don't shoot
the singer, he's doing his best, and have you seen the pen
of my aunt, <i>parceque je suis Americain et Anglais, et
Français, et bon garçon et votre ami. Oui! Oui! Je vous
aime, Monsieur le Sergent. Comment allez-vous ce matin,
et Madame votre femme et tons les petits sergents?</i>...
'Kiss me Hardy,' said Nelson, and 'War is Hell' replied
Sherman."</p>

<p>The man's head and shoulders came up over the wall,
and, placing both hands upon it, he leant right over and
stared at me, his mouth open and his eyes starting from his
head.</p>

<p>"<i>Que le diable emportez-vous?</i>" the Zouave growled.
"Who the devil are you and what the hell are you doing
there?"</p>

<p>And with a watchful eye upon his empty right hand, I
raised myself from the ground, swiftly gabbling that I was
a friend and guest of Colonel Levasseur, that I brought
most urgent and important information, and that he must
either call the Colonel instantly, or let me come over the
wall.</p>

<p>The wary man's right hand disappeared from sight, and
I flopped back into the dust as it returned holding that
beastly automatic.</p>

<p>Damn the thick-headed fool! I had torn off my head-dress
exposing my fair neck, ears and hair, and the mob would
charge again at any minute.</p>

<p>"When I shout '<i>Come</i>,' jump over the wall and throw
yourself on the ground," bawled the quick-witted clever
man whom I had so miscalled. "And lie down quick on this
side, or I'll blow your head off," he concluded and
disappeared.</p>

<p>"<i>Come!</i>" he shouted a second later, and I fairly threw
myself over the wall and at the feet of the Sergeant, while
he and several of his officious braves covered me with
their rifles.</p>

<p>"Colonel Levasseur will be round here in a minute. You
stay like that till he comes," said the Zouave Sergeant,
and, as he turned away, bade two of his men to shoot me if
I moved, or if they felt like it.</p>

<p>I proceeded to play at Living Statuary and tried not to
twitch a muscle even when flies endeavoured to explore my
brain by way of my eyes, ears and nose.</p>

<p>Among the men who crouched lining the wall were many
others who lay at full length upon the ground, dead or
too badly wounded to make further effort. The garrison
had suffered heavily, both from rifle-fire and from the
constant hand-to-hand <i>mêlées</i>, when the swords of the
Arabs had met the bayonets of the soldiers.</p>

<p>As I watched, a military surgeon, followed by four
hospital-orderlies, or stretcher-bearers, came round the
corner of the house, and, in spite of the continual heavy
fire, had the severely wounded carried away, and the dead
laid in a row where they would not cause the feet of the
fighting-men to stumble. The less-severely wounded were
bandaged where they sat with their backs to the wall.</p>

<p>"What's this?" asked the Surgeon-Major, whom I knew
well, as he passed me. "An Arab prisoner? What do you want
<i>prisoners</i> for?"</p>

<p>"True," I answered, to his great astonishment,
"especially when they are not only civilians but
neutrals."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" ejaculated the Major. "But you look a
pretty bloody neutral and a fairly war-like civilian ..."
and he bent over the still form of a Zouave....</p>

<p>Colonel Levasseur came round the same corner, cool as on
parade, followed by his <i>officier d'ordonnance</i>.</p>

<p>"'Evening, Colonel," I called, rising to my feet.
"Excuse a certain disorder of dress...."</p>

<p>"Good God! It <i>is</i> you, Vanbrugh!" he said, seizing
my hand and leading me into the house. "<i>Where's your
sister?</i>"</p>

<p>"De Beaujolais has taken her away with him," I replied,
"and Captain de Redon says they have got clear of the
town.... And I am to tell you that a detachment of Zouaves,
under Bouchard, is fighting its way here, and is held up in
the Street of the Silversmiths ... a huge mob between them
and you...."</p>

<p>"And you fought your way in here to bring them relief?"
cried the good Colonel, and for one dreadful moment I
thought he was going to embrace and kiss me. "You shall
get the Cross of the Legion of Honour for that, my brave
friend.... You have offered your life for Frenchmen and for
France...."</p>

<p>"Fought nothing, Colonel," I assured him.... "Offered
nothing.... I snooped around in a great funk, pinched these
rags from dead men's backs, and crawled in here on my
tummy.... But if you'll give me a rifle and a quiet corner,
I can hit a running Arab at twenty yards, especially if he
is running at <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>Levasseur smiled.</p>

<p>"Up on the roof then," he said, "and snipe their
snipers. There are some swine with Lebel rifles on
neighbouring high buildings, who are doing a lot of
damage.... Take care of yourself.... Better put on a
<i>képi</i> and tunic before you go up&mdash;you look like the
President of all the Dervishes and you might get a bayonet
in you before you could explain.... Excuse me, I must get
Bouchard's lot in.... Down the Street of the Silversmiths,
you said?..."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Outside the room which the Surgeon-Major had turned into
an operating theatre, there was a pile of blood-stained
clothing and accoutrements. From among these I took a
<i>képi</i>, regimental jacket, pouch-belt and rifle, and
made my way up through the well-known interior&mdash;so
familiar and yet so utterly different&mdash;to the roof,
the parapet of which was lined with sharp-shooters who kept
up a continual independent fire at surrounding minarets,
watch-towers, and roofs of higher houses, which overlooked
and commanded this one.</p>

<p>"Hi! Who are you?" cried a bearded officer crouching
against the wall opposite the little stone porch, built
over the top of the steps that led to the roof.</p>

<p>I knew him by sight but couldn't remember his name.</p>

<p>"Colonel Levasseur's guest, Vanbrugh," I shouted. "He
told me to come up here."</p>

<p>"Run across and lie down here," he called back, and I
noticed that he drew his revolver as I did so.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," he said, "I didn't recognize you&mdash;I
don't think that <i>Madame votre mère</i> would do so,
either.... Now, if you can get the sportsman who is
ensconced in the corner of that roof <i>there</i>, you'll have
earned your corn for the day.... He's shot four of my men
already, in spite of the bad light...."</p>

<p>So, for a brief space, I was an unenlisted man, fighting
for France and my own skin. It was extremely exciting
and thrilling, and one was too busy to be nervous.
Snap-shooting by flickering firelight, mingled with bright
moonlight, is very interesting.</p>

<p>The sniper and I fought our little duel out.... I got
quite fond of him.... R.I.P.... Perhaps my rifle was better
than his, though I had no fault to find with the latter
when it took my <i>képi</i> from my head, nor when it spoilt the
perfectly good collar of my unbuttoned jacket.... The light
was good enough for him, anyhow....</p>

<p>I was aware of the increasing sounds of approaching
volley-firing. Evidently Bouchard's detachment were
overcoming resistance and fighting their way in.</p>

<p>The officer in command of the roof was sending more and
more men over to the side that commanded the square, so I
went across to that side too, chiefly with the object of
getting a good view of the show when the Zouaves burst into
the open, and charged through.</p>

<p>Cautiously I peeped over the parapet.</p>

<p>Another assault was impending, and down the Street
of the Silversmiths came the swiftest of those who were
fleeing before the Zouaves.</p>

<p>At their head was a figure that I recognized&mdash;an
almost naked scarecrow that spun round occasionally as he
ran, and twirled a great staff above his head.</p>

<p>I rushed to my officer and indicated de Redon to
him, and then with a brief "Excuse me," cast military
propriety to the winds, dashed across to the stairs,
and down them in search of Levasseur.... I could not
run round to every officer, non-commissioned officer,
and soldier in the building, and point out de Redon to
him individually&mdash;but I had some sort of idea that
Levasseur might sound the "Cease fire!" while de Redon did
his work and then rushed off elsewhere....</p>

<p>I made a swift tour of the upper floor, of which each
window and balcony was crowded with soldiers, behind whom
lay the bodies of those who would fight no more.</p>

<p>I had expected to find the Colonel on the big wide
verandah that ran the length of the front of the house,
on either side of the vast roof of the colonnaded porch.
This verandah had a low wall or parapet and, like the
compound-wall below, was lined with soldiers.</p>

<p>Levasseur was not here, and, as I glanced below, I saw
great masses of men gathering to surge across the square
in a mighty overwhelming wave once more. I saw a mob
come rushing down the Street of the Silversmiths, and de
Redon&mdash;far ahead of them&mdash;bounding, leaping,
twirling and yelling in front of the main attack opposite
the front of the Residency.</p>

<p>"<i>Back! Back!</i>" he howled. "<i>Beware! Beware!... The big
guns are coming.... Run!... Run!...</i>"</p>

<p>I also ran, down the stairs that led to
the entrance-hall, and out into the compound,
where the soldiers&mdash;whose fire-control was
admirable&mdash;crouched along the wall like statues with
levelled rifles, awaiting the volley-signal.</p>

<p>As I rushed past the bearers of a pitiful blinded
Zouave, and down the steps under the porch, I saw Colonel
Levasseur, standing between his second-in-command and his
aide-de-camp, pointing with raised arm, and, as I saw
him, I received a tremendous blow that knocked me down. I
thought someone had hit me, looked round, and got to my
feet, feeling very queer....</p>

<p>What was it that I had been about to do?... Something
very urgent and important.... De Redon!</p>

<p>As I reeled forward, trying to shout, Levasseur's voice
rang out with tremendous volume and authority.... He was
still pointing.... He himself was ordering a volley!... I
staggered towards him mouthing silently....</p>

<p>With a great crash, every rifle along that side of the
compound was fired.... The earth rose up and hit me or else
I fell to the ground....</p>

<p>Another great shout from Levasseur.... Another
volley....</p>

<p>I tore myself from what seemed the powerful grip of
Mother Earth, steadied myself, and saw de Redon doing
exactly what I was doing, standing, swaying, tottering, his
hands pressed to his breast.... Why was he imitating me?...
Why could I not shout to Levasseur?...</p>

<p>De Redon fell heavily, head foremost.... So did I....
Why was I imitating him?... A great faintness.... A grim
fierce face before my closing eyes.... An Arab about to
slay me?... No, a feathered head-dress&mdash;a face more
powerful than that of any Arab.... Thank you, Chief....
Dogged does it.... Grit ... and grit ... and iron
guts....</p>

<p>I was on my feet again; breathing more easily too;
pulling myself together again; coming round; blood running
down my chest and arm....</p>

<p>I reached Levasseur's side somehow&mdash;and found I
could not speak!</p>

<p>"<i>Vous êtes bien touché, mon pauvre ami!</i>" he said, in
his great rough kindly voice.</p>

<p>I could not make a sound in answer, and he turned from
me and bawled another order. The aide-de-camp shouted
something about going inside and finding the doctor.</p>

<p>I tried to pull my jacket off and he gave me a hand,
thinking I was trying to get at my wound.</p>

<p>Dropping my <i>képi</i> on the ground by the jacket, I made
for the wall, wearing only an Arab garment like a long
shirt, and very baggy Arab trousers&mdash;both garments
filthy and covered in blood, mine and that of their late
owner.</p>

<p>I managed to get over the low wall without being grabbed
by one of the defenders, and a stumbling, tottering run
brought me to where de Redon lay in his blood.</p>

<p>Stooping to give him a hand, I found that it would only
be a hand, for my right arm had ceased to function. It
merely swung numb and useless, as I bent down.</p>

<p>De Redon did not move. I seized him and began to drag
him in the direction of the wall.... His rotten rags
tore away, and I fell.... The pain, for which I had
been subconsciously waiting, began then, and I think it
stimulated me.</p>

<p>I got up again and turned de Redon over. I wanted to
get a grip on something he was wearing. Lift him I could
not, with only one arm and scarcely the strength to keep
myself erect. It seemed beastly to pull him by the arm or
leg or hair.... He was most obviously dead.... Horribly
riddled....</p>

<p>None the less, I must get him.... I would <i>not</i> go back
without him, and, with a word of apology I seized his wrist
and began to drag....</p>

<p>I was astonished to find myself alive.</p>

<p>Why was I not shot by one side&mdash;or both?</p>

<p>I concluded that the very few on either side who had
time to notice me, took me for a friend. The French
soldiers were not firing independently but were awaiting
the order for the next volley, and they had seen me run
out from the compound. The Arabs saw a blood-stained Arab,
escaping presumably from the French; but they would begin
to shoot at me as soon as they saw me dragging a body to
the compound.... Or would they think me mad?... Anyhow I
was going on the return journey, making good time, and in
another minute I should be at the wall....</p>

<p>Was it <i>possible</i> that not three minutes ago I had been
up on the roof exchanging pot-shots in a friendly and
sporting spirit with a very competent sniper?...</p>

<p>A few more yards and ...</p>

<p>There was a sudden deafening crescendo of the infernal
din, a hellish roar from ten thousand throats ... a
crashing volley ... another ... and I was hurled headlong,
trampled flat, smashed and ground and crushed, a living
agony&mdash;until a smashing blow upon the head was a
crowning mercy that brought oblivion. </p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p> I must have been unconscious for a very long
time&mdash;or, what is more probable, I must have
been unconscious and semi-conscious, off and on, for
hours&mdash;as I have a recollection of terrible
battle-dreams, of receiving further injuries, and of being
partly buried beneath a heavy weight.</p>

<p>When I awoke, or regained full consciousness, the
sun was setting and the battle was over.... Gradually I
realized that I must have been where I was, for nearly a
day.... Absolute silence reigned where the very spirit of
devilish din had so long rioted.... I was lying where I had
fallen.... The body of a big Arab lay across my legs....
The head of another was on my stomach, face downwards....
More were sprawled and huddled close against me. All very
intimate and cosy together.</p>

<p>With great effort and greater pain, I slowly turned my
head in the direction of the Residency, and beheld its
charred and blackened ruins affronting the rising sun.
The compound wall appeared to be hidden by the piles of
dead.</p>

<p>I hoped that the garrison had died in the compound and
not in the burning building. I thought of the wounded laid
out in rows in the corridor outside the operating-room.</p>

<p>My next effort was in the direction of self-help, and
was fruitless. What I earnestly desired to do was to remove
the head of the dead Arab from the pit of my stomach, where
it seemed to have the weight and size of a mile-stone.</p>

<p>I soon discovered that it would be all I could do to
remove a fly from the end of my nose, and that by the time
I did it the fly would be gone. I don't suppose I could
have moved if those two bodies had not been lying upon me.
I had lost a great deal of blood, from two bullet wounds
in the neck and shoulder, and a bad sword-cut on the
head....</p>

<p>It is a truth as well as a truism that we don't know our
blessings when we receive them. In fact it is impossible
to tell a blessing from a curse. But for those wounds, I
should have got back into the Residency and died with the
rest. When that enthusiast with the sword did his good
deed for the day, he saved my life (and a life worth a
thousand of mine, as well) and I never even saw his bright
countenance.</p>

<p>That night was just endurable, but to this hour I do not
greatly care to dwell upon the day that followed. How much
was delirium, nightmare-dream, subjective horror, and how
much was real, I do not know. But there were unutterable
agonies of thirst and terrible pain, and the unbearable
burning of the sun upon one's exposed unmoving flesh; there
were vultures, kites and pariah dogs; prowling ghouls who
robbed the pitiful dead; times when I gained full control
of my faculties and lost them again in paroxysms of
screaming terror, pain and fear&mdash;silent screams that
did not issue from cracked black lips.</p>

<p>And always there were flies in thousands of millions.</p>

<p>At times I was mad and delirious; at times I must have
been mercifully unconscious; and at times I was quite
clear-headed, and perhaps those were the worst.</p>

<p>I distinctly remember concluding that my father was
right and that I was wrong. There was a Great Good God of
Love and Mercy who let us be born filled with Original Sin
and who had created an Eternal Hell for all that sinned.
I had sinned&mdash;and here I was, nailed down and being
slowly roasted, in unspeakable pain, for ever and for ever.
Yes, Father was right, and Noel and I had been wrong in
agreeing that such would not be the nature of a God of
Love, but rather of a Devil of Hate.</p>

<p>I believe that I slept when kind beneficent Night
succeeded hellish torturing Day. At any rate, I was
unconscious for most of the time, and remember nothing but
occasional glimpses of the stars, and then, with shrinking
abject terror, seeing the sun rise.</p>

<p>That was the last of conscious suffering, for I remember
no more, and I afterwards learned that I had a very narrow
escape of being buried alive when the French relief-force
arrived and began clearing up the mess.</p>

<p>It was my white skin that saved me. The men of the
burial-fatigue party who were removing my body with those
of hundreds of others, noticed that I was some kind of
a European, and drew the attention of their Sergeant to
the fact. This man informed an officer, and the officer
discovered that I was alive as well as white&mdash;in
parts.</p>

<p>In the military hospital I was most kindly and
competently nursed, and, when fit to be moved, I was
transferred to Algiers that I might have the benefit
of sea-breezes, ice, fresh fruit, better food, and the
creature comforts unprocurable in the desert city of
Zaguig.</p>

<p>And here I told my tale to the authorities, or rather
to the very charming representative of the authorities who
visited me in hospital.</p>

<p>Having given all the information that I could,
concerning the fate of the garrison of Zaguig, I sought for
news of de Beaujolais, but I forbore to mention that my
sister was with him.... He had seemed so very averse from
taking her, and had made the military impropriety of such
a thing so clear, that I thought it best to say nothing on
the subject&mdash;particularly when I found that they knew
absolutely nothing as to his fate, and did not expect to
do so for weeks or months. My informant professed absolute
ignorance of de Beaujolais' destination even.</p>

<p>I decided that, whether the doctors released me from
hospital or not, I would remain in Algiers until there was
definite news of de Beaujolais. I would then fit out a
caravan and go in search of him and of my sister....</p>

<p>After a certain point, I did not progress very
favourably. My wounds healed well, but I suffered most
appalling headaches&mdash;whether from the sword-cut or
from sunstroke did not seem clear. At times I thought
a splinter of bone must be pressing on my brain, but
the admirable surgeon assured me that the bone was not
splintered at all, and that the headaches would grow less
frequent and less painful.</p>

<p>They did neither, and I decided that I would go to
London and see Sir Herbert Menken, then considered the
greatest consulting-surgeon in the world.</p>

<p>And while I was slowly gathering energy and still
putting off the evil day of travel, Mary arrived, well,
smiling, radiantly happy, and engaged to marry Major de
Beaujolais.</p>

<p>She had accompanied him to his destination and returned
with him to Zaguig, fearing the worst so far as I was
concerned. Here they had heard of my escape, and a black
cloud had been lifted from Mary's mind&mdash;for the joy
and happiness of her engagement to the man whom she had
"loved at first sight" had been darkened and damaged by her
fear&mdash;fear amounting almost to a certainty&mdash;of my
death.</p>

<p>However, she had hoped against hope, and had moreover
been conscious of an illogical but persistent belief that I
was not dead.</p>

<p>She assured me that one corner of her mind had not been
in the least surprised when they got the astounding news
that I had survived and was, in fact, the sole survivor of
the massacre....</p>

<p>Mary and I took up our temporary abode at the Hotel
Splendide at Mustapha Supérieur, and she nursed me while de
Beaujolais reported himself and his doings to the military
authorities, and obtained furlough for his marriage and
honeymoon.</p>

<p>I went with them to Paris after the wedding, where de
Beaujolais shopped assiduously with Mary and showed himself
not only brave but <i>foulard</i>-y, and thence, alone and very
lonely, ill and miserable, I went on to London in the
desperate hope that Sir Herbert Menken could do something
to relieve my almost unbearable headache, insomnia,
neurasthenia and general feeling of hopeless illness.</p>

<p>I was quickly coming to the point where either
something must be done to me, or I must do something to
myself&mdash;something quite final, with a pistol. </p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="first">
How shall hasty and impatient Man know his blessings
from his curses, his good from his evil?</p>

<p>Good came upon me at this time in most terrible form,
and in my ignorance I prayed to be delivered from my good,
from the blessing that brought me my life's usefulness and
joy....</p>

<p>I arose on this particular morning, in London, feeling
ill and apprehensive, afraid of I knew not what, but
none the less afraid. I was in the grip of Hell's chief
devil&mdash;Fear&mdash;the fear of something wholly
unspecified.</p>

<p>Having dressed, with trembling fingers, I avoided the
hotel dining-room and, as early as was reasonable, I set
forth, bathed in perspiration, to keep my appointment with
Sir Herbert Menken.</p>

<p>"Taxi, sir?" inquired the Jovian hall-porter, as I
passed the counter behind which he lurked, all-seeing and
omniscient&mdash;and it was borne in upon me that his query
was absurd. <i>Of course</i> I could not enter a taxi! What a
horrible idea!... I would as soon have cut my throat as get
into a taxi&mdash;or any other vehicle.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens, no!" I replied shuddering, and passed
out into the street, much perturbed at the man's horrible
suggestion.</p>

<p>Dreading and hating the throng, the noise, the traffic,
I made my way along the street, feeling as I had never felt
before, and as I pray God I may never feel again.</p>

<p>I would have given anything to have been back in Zaguig
with all its murderous dangers, provided I could have felt
as I did there.</p>

<p>I was not in pain ... I did not feel definitely ill
in any definite part of my body ... I was not afraid of
anything to which I could give a name ... And yet I felt
terrible. Every nerve in my body shrieked to God for mercy,
and I knew that unless I did <i>something</i> (but what, in the
name of Pity?) and did it quickly, I should go mad or fling
myself under a street-car or truck....</p>

<p>I fought my way on....</p>

<p>Merciful Christ have pity! This was suffering such as
the Zaguigans could never have caused me with knives or
red-hot irons.... Where was I?... <i>What</i> was I?...</p>

<p>Suddenly I knew what I was....</p>

<p>Of course! I was a shell-fish deprived of its shell,
and wholly at the mercy of its environing universe. Yes,
I was a creature of the crustacean kind, a sort of crab
or lobster, without its armour. Every wave of ether
could strike me a cruel blow; the least thing touching
me would cause me agony unspeakable&mdash;even rays of
light impinging upon my exposed nerve-surfaces would
be,&mdash;nay, <i>were</i>&mdash;as barbed arrows, spears and
javelins....</p>

<p>If a passer-by brushed against me, I should
shriek&mdash;a flayed man rubbed with sand-paper....
Yes&mdash;I was a naked crustacean, and I must find a hole
into which to creep.... A nice hole beneath a great rock; a
hole just big enough to contain, without touching, me....
There I should be saved from the eyes and hands, the mouths
and antennæ of the million-headed ...</p>

<p>But I could see no hole into which to creep....</p>

<p>I took a grip upon my courage, and passed on, in search
of one&mdash;a beautiful dark cave, just big enough ...</p>

<p>I reached the end of the block and was about to step off
the side-walk when I realized my new danger. If I stepped
into the road, the flood of traffic that streamed along
it would bear me away irresistibly; away, on and on, into
some wild and whirling Charybdis, wherein I should for
ever go round and round with accelerating velocity for all
eternity, never, never to find the beautiful dark cave that
was my great necessity....</p>

<p>I had had a narrow escape from a terrible danger, and
I drew back from the gutter, and crouched against some
railings. These seemed friendly. At any rate, they did not
hurry along, nor whirl round. I clung to them, conscious of
the stares of the curious as they hurried past, immersed in
their own affairs, but with a glance to spare for mine.</p>

<p>Two errand-boys passed, one in a many-buttoned
uniform.</p>

<p>"Blimey! <i>'E</i>'s 'ad a 'appy evenin' somewheres,"
observed one of them. " 'E sang '<i>Won't be 'ome till
mornin</i>'&mdash;and 'e ain't."</p>

<p>"Yus," agreed the other, eyeing me with a large
toleration, "some people 'as all the luck."</p>

<p>I tried to give them money, to get them to go away and
cease to look at me, but my hand so shook that I could not
get at my pocket.</p>

<p>I turned my face to the railings and, peering through
them, saw that they guarded an "area" or small paved yard
on to which looked the basement-windows of the house. And
into this yard, some twenty feet below me, opened the
door of a coal-cellar, or some such place&mdash;a dark,
quiet, beautiful cave into which one could crawl and be
safe from mocking eyes and jeering voices, from touching
hands and feeling antennæ, from <i>everything</i> that could, by
the slightest contact, agonize one's utterly exposed and
unprotected surfaces.</p>

<p>If only I could get to that dark beautiful cave!... But
if I loosened my grip of the railings I might fall, or be
carried along until I was thrust into the dark river of the
roadway and whirled to destruction never-ending.</p>

<p>I moved along the railings, not releasing one hand-grip
until I had secured the next, and the perspiration
streamed down me as I concentrated every faculty upon this
difficult progress to the gate that I could see at the head
of a flight of stone steps, leading down to my cave of
safety....</p>

<p>And then a Voice smote me, and I looked over my
shoulder, my heart in my mouth.</p>

<p>"What's the game, Sir?" said the Voice.</p>

<p>It was a vast and splendid London policeman, one of
those strong quiet men, wise, calm, unarmed, dressed in
a long authority, the very embodiment of law, order and
security, the wonder and admiration of Europe.</p>

<p>Terrible as it was to be addressed and scrutinized, I
felt I could bear the agony of it, because these men are
universal friends and helpers to all but evil-doers.</p>

<p>"I am an unshelled crustacean ... I want to get down to
that cave," I said, pointing.</p>

<p>"Crushed <i>what</i>?... Want to get home, you mean, I think,
Sir," was the reply. "Where's that?"</p>

<p>"In America," I said.</p>

<p>"Longish way," observed the policeman. "Where did you
sleep last night, if it isn't asking?"</p>

<p>"At my hotel," I replied.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;that's better, Sir," said the good fellow.
"Which one?... We might get back there perhaps, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;I couldn't ... I simply could <i>not</i>," I
assured him. "I would sooner die ... I <i>should</i> die&mdash;a
dreadful death...."</p>

<p>"<i>Pass along, please!</i>" said the policeman suddenly and
sharply, to the small crowd that had collected. "'Ere,
you&mdash;<i>'op</i> it&mdash;quick," he added to a blue-nosed
loafer, who stood gazing bovine and unobedient....</p>

<p>I can remember every word and incident of that truly
terrible time, for myself stood apart and watched the
suffering wretch that was me, and could give no help, could
do nothing but look on&mdash;and suffer unutterably.</p>

<p>"Now then, Sir," said the policeman, "if you can't go
'ome, an' you won't go to your 'otel, where <i>can</i> you
go?... We all got to go somewheres, y' know....</p>

<p>"You don't want to come along o' me, do yer?" he
added as I pondered his dark saying that we must all go
somewhere, shook my head in despair, and clung to the
railings.</p>

<p>"With <i>you</i>? Where to?" I asked, with a new hope.</p>

<p>"Station," he replied. "Sit down in a nice quiet
little&mdash;er&mdash;room&mdash;while we find out
something about yer."</p>

<p>"I should love it," I told him. "Could you put me in a
cell and lock the door?"</p>

<p>"You'd have to <i>do</i> somethink first," the kindly man
assured me.</p>

<p>This seemed a splendid chance! Fancy being concealed in
a beautiful dark cell until my shell grew again and there
was something between my exposed nerves, my bare raw flesh,
my ultimate innermost self, and the rough-shod rasping
world!</p>

<p>"If I gave you a sovereign and thumped you on the chest,
would you arrest me for assault and lock me up?" I asked.
"Do&mdash;for Mercy's sake ... I'll give you anything you
like&mdash;all I have."</p>

<p>"<i>Come</i>, come now, sir," expostulated the officer, "you
let me put you in a taxi, and you go back to your 'otel
an' go to bed an' 'ave a good sleep.... If you don't feel
better then, you tell 'em to send for a doctor....</p>

<p>"You a teetotaller?" he added, as I stared hopelessly at
his impassive face.</p>

<p>"Practically," I said. "Not in theory, you know, but
..."</p>

<p>"Any'ow you ain't drunk <i>now</i>," he admitted, sniffing,
and added briskly, "Come along, now, sir! This ain't no way
for a gent to be'ave at ten o'clock of a Monday morning,"
and, turning to the lingering passers-by, suddenly boomed,
"<i>Will</i> you passer<i>long</i>, please," in a manner that swiftly
relieved me of the painful stare of many gazing eyes.</p>

<p>One man did not pass along, however, nor go by on the
other side.... No Levite, he....</p>

<p>He was a small neat man, very well dressed in a quiet
way.</p>

<p>"You are like a moth," I said. "For God's sake spread
your wings over me.... My shell has come off...."</p>

<p>Of course he was like a moth. He had great black
eyebrows and deep luminous eyes ... sphinx-like, he was ...
the sphinx-moth....</p>

<p>I had seen moths with just such eyebrows, and eyes
shining in the lamp-light....</p>

<p>"Ill?" he asked, and took my wrist between finger and
thumb. "What's your name and address?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," I replied. "Do help me ... I'm in
Hell&mdash;body and soul ... and I shall shriek in a
minute.... For the love of God help me to find a cave or a
hole ..."</p>

<p>"Come along with me," he said promptly, "I've got a
beauty...."</p>

<p>He stared hard into my eyes, and in his I saw
goodness and friendship, and I believed and trusted him
implicitly....</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>I had fallen into the hands of the greatest alienist and
nerve-specialist in England.... Coincidence?...</p>

<p>Tucking his arm through mine, he detached me from the
railings, led me to the house, close by, in Harley Street,
where he had his consulting-rooms, gave me a draught of the
veritable Waters of Lethe, and put me to bed on a sofa in a
back room.</p>

<p>Without troubling to discover whether I was a pauper,
a criminal, an escaped lunatic, or a prince in disguise,
he took me that night to his far-famed nursing-home in
Kent.</p>

<p>And here, my salvation, in guise incredible, most
wonderfully awaited me. </p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p> At Shillingford House, a great old mansion of warm red
Tudor brick, Dr. Hanley-Blythe kept me in bed for a week
or so, visiting me upon alternate days and submitting me
to an extraordinarily searching cross-examination, many of
the questions of which, I was at first inclined to resent.
I soon realized, however, that there was absolutely nothing
in the specialist's mind but the promotion of my welfare,
and I answered every question truthfully and to the best of
my ability.</p>

<p>One day, after carefully and patiently extracting from
me every detail of a ghastly dream that I had had the
previous night&mdash;a dream in which I dreamt that I
murdered my father&mdash;he asked:</p>

<p>"Did you love your father when you were a boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"Certain?" he queried.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;yes&mdash;I think so...." I said.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't. In fact I know you didn't," he countered. I
thought a while, and realized that the doctor was right.
Of course I had never loved my father. I had respected,
feared, obeyed and <i>hated</i> him.... He had been the Terror
that walked by day and the Fear that stalked me by
night....</p>

<p>"Face the facts, my dear chap," said the doctor. "What
is, <i>is</i>&mdash;and your salvation depends on freeing your
mind from repressions, and making a new adjustment to
life.... The truth will make you free&mdash;and whole....
Get it up, and get it out...."</p>

<p>I pondered deeply and delved into the past.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say that I have always hated my father,"
I confessed. "Feared and hated him terribly...."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and you made your God in your father's
image," said the doctor....</p>

<p>"I have 'feared God' but not hated Him," I replied.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" exploded Dr. Hanley-Blythe. "Don't we hate
<i>everything</i> and everyone that we fear?... Fear is a curse,
a disease? a deadly microbe ... the seed of death and
damnation.... Since we are speaking of God&mdash;get rid of
that foul idea of 'fear God.'...</p>

<p>"<i>Love</i> God.... What decent God would rather be feared
than loved?... Let's have a God that is a <i>little</i>
more divine than a damned savage Ju-Ju!... That cursed
injunction to <i>fear</i> God!... Killed more souls and bodies
than anything else.... Love God and fear <i>nothing</i>!... Some
sense in that....</p>

<p>"Now look here&mdash;get your father in perspective.
He's a poor human sinner like yourself and me. A man of
like passions with us.... Probably always meant for the
best&mdash;and did his best&mdash;by you.... Nothing to
<i>fear</i>&mdash;a frail sinner like the rest of us.... No
power over you now, anyhow....</p>

<p>"When you go to sleep to-night, say out loud:</p>

<p>"'Poor old Dad! I feared and hated you&mdash;but now I
do neither.... I never understood you&mdash;but I do now.'
Then say, also out loud, 'God means Good, and Good means
God.... God is Love and Love is God.'... See?"</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>And another time.</p>

<p>"You are a bachelor?... Well, you shouldn't be.... No
healthy man has a right to be a bachelor at your age....
And you have always lived the celibate life in absolute
chastity?... Hm!... We shall have to find you a wife, my
boy!... I prescribe sunshine and fresh air, occupation and
plenty of it, a trip to see your father&mdash;whom you will
smite on the back and address as 'Dear old Dad&mdash;you
heavy-father old fraud'&mdash;<i>and a wife</i>.... Yes, a
wife, <i>and</i>, in due course, about three sons and two
daughters....</p>

<p>"What do I think caused your breakdown?... I don't
'think'&mdash;I <i>know</i>.... Your father, of whom you had
too much, and your wife whom you never had at all....
Caused a neurosis, and when you got physically knocked out
at Zaguig, it sprang up and choked you.... And now get up
and dress and go out in the grounds and sit in the sun and
realize what a harmless old chap your father is, and what
a kind friendly fatherly jolly old God made the beautiful
jolly old world that we muck-up so much.... And think over
all the girls you know, and decide which one you will ask
to marry you.... <i>Marriage will be your sure salvation....</i>
I prescribe it...."</p>

<p>A couple of nurses&mdash;kind devoted souls&mdash;helped
me into an invalid chair and wheeled me out into the
grounds. They found me a beautiful hidden spot among great
rhododendron bushes where I should be safely concealed,
protected from the rear and on either hand, and have a
glorious view of the rolling Kentish park-land before me.
They assured me that the path by which we had come was very
rarely used, and left me in my wheeled chair to wonder
whether I should ever be a man again....</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>... "Think over all the nice girls you know, and decide
which one you will ask to marry you.... <i>Marriage will be
your sure salvation.</i>"</p>

<p>There was only one woman in all the world, and she was
already married....</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>I hope no-one in this world suffers as I suffered in
mind and body during those days. </p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p> I believe that there really are people to whom
"experiences" of the psychic and super-normal order are
vouchsafed.</p>

<p>I have both read and heard of well-attested cases
of dreams and appearances, inexplicable voices, and
waking visions whereby information was imparted, or help
sought.</p>

<p>Nothing of that sort has ever occurred to me.</p>

<p>I have not, on looking into my mirror at night, beheld
the agonized and beseeching face of the woman who needed my
help beyond all things, the woman whom I was to love and to
marry.</p>

<p>I have not dreamed dreams and seen visions in which such
a woman has implored my instant aid and told me exactly
what to do, and how, and when and where to do it.</p>

<p>I have not heard a mysterious voice, clear and solemn as
a bell, speak in my astounded ear and say, "Come. I need
you. Hasten quickly to such-and-such a place and you will
find...."</p>

<p>I have seen no ghost nor apparition that has given me a
message.</p>

<p>Nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>But the following fact is interesting.</p>

<p>I sat in my retreat, one day, thinking of Isobel,
wondering where she was and what she was doing, whether she
were happy every minute of the day, and whether it would
be my fate ever to see her again.... Long, long thoughts
between waking and sleeping.... And then with shaking hand
and fumbling trembling fingers I opened a book that one of
the nurses had left with me, "in case I felt like reading
for a little while."...</p>

<p>And, opening at random in the middle of the book, I
read: </p>

<br>
<p class="quote">"... his vision of her was to be his Faith
and Hope and was to be all his future. She was to be
his life and his life was to be hers.... For he was a
Worshipper, a Worshipper of Beauty, as were they who lived
'or ever the knightly years had gone with the old world
to the grave,'&mdash;they to whom the Face was not the
face upon a coin, the pale and common drudge 'twixt man
and man, but the face of a beautiful woman, the Supreme
Reality, the Focus of Desire&mdash;that desire which is
not of the body, not of the earth, not of the Self, but
pure and noble Love&mdash;God's manifestation to the world
that something of God is in man and something of man is in
God.... This knight thus worshipped God through the woman,
with a love that was spiritual of the spirit, with no
taint of Self.... And his motto and desire was Service....
Her service without reward; the service that is its own
reward.... For he felt that there must come for the World's
salvation from materialism and soul's death, a Renaissance,
a Reformation&mdash;of Love....</p>

<p class="quote">
"Love that was once the road to all perfection; man's cry to
God, to Beauty, to the Beauty of God and the God of
Beauty.... Love that once leapt free from flesh and cried
aloud, not, 'Love me that I may be blessed and comforted and
rendered happy,' but 'Let me serve thee with my love, that I
may help and bless and comfort thee and render thee
happy....' Love that was Service, the highest service of God
through, the service of His noblest
expression&mdash;Woman.... Love, that divine selfless thing,
Man's great and true salvation, the World's one need, the
World's last hope....</p>

<p class="quote">
"He would dedicate his life to the service of this woman,
asking of her nothing more than that he might dedicate his
life to her service in the name of Selfless Love, the Love
that is its own reward, its exceeding rich reward...."</p>

<p>...and at the sound of a footstep, I here looked
up&mdash;and beheld Isobel.</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p> <i>Isobel</i>, actual and alive ... looking older and
looking ill and pale and too ethereal, and lovelier if
possible.</p>

<p>Our eyes met.... For a second we stared incredulous.</p>

<p>"<i>Isobel!</i>" I cried, still dreaming.</p>

<p>"The dear nice American boy!" she whispered.</p>

<p>Tears came into her beautiful eyes, her sweet and lovely
face grew yet paler, and she swayed as though about to
faint.</p>

<p>With a strength that I certainly had not possessed a
minute before, I sprang to my feet, caught her in my arms
and lifted her into the chair. Her need and weakness gave
me strength, and I was ashamed&mdash;ashamed that I had sat
trembling and shaking there&mdash;envying any healthy hobo
that tramped the road&mdash;longing for death and thinking
upon ways of finding it....</p>

<p><i>Isobel!... Here!...</i></p>

<p>She must be a patient of Dr. Hanley-Blythe ... ill
... in great sorrow, judging by the look upon her lovely
face....</p>

<p>I was shamefully conscious of noting that, by her dress,
she was not a widow.... And then I rose above my lowest,
and strove to put myself aside entirely.... <i>Isobel</i> was
here&mdash;and ill.... Surely I could serve her in some
way, if only by wheeling her about in a bath-chair ...
reading to her....</p>

<p>"I can't believe it.... I must be dreaming ..." she said
as these thoughts flashed through my mind.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear American boy&mdash;will you help me.... I am
in such trouble...."</p>

<p><i>Help</i> her! Would I <i>help</i> her!</p>

<p>My illness fell from me, and I stood erect, and
strong&mdash;I who had recently been assisted to crawl to
that invalid's chair, a wretched trembling neurotic....</p>

<p>"John ... my husband.... They have taken him.... Oh!..."
Her eyes brimmed over and her trembling lips refused
their service.... She covered her face and gave way to
tears....</p>

<p>Her husband!...</p>

<p>I knelt beside the chair.... By the time my knee had
touched the grass, I had crushed back the thoughts,
"Her husband.... 'They' have taken him.... Dead by now,
probably.... '<i>Think of all the girls you know.... Marriage
will be your sure salvation.</i>'..."&mdash;and I was
unselfish and pure in heart&mdash;purified by the clear
flame that burnt within me, before this woman's altar that
was my heart.</p>

<p>"Tell me," I said.... "And then believe! Believe with
all your soul that I can help you somehow.... Be sure of
it.... <i>Know</i> it.... Why&mdash;surely I was created for
that purpose...."</p>

<p>I was a little unbalanced, a little beside myself, and
more than a little inspired....</p>

<p>And I inspired Isobel&mdash;with hope.... And with faith
and with belief&mdash;belief in me, her servant.</p>

<p>Under the influence of my assurance and re-assurance,
she told me her pitiful tale from beginning to end....</p>

<p>I sat on the ground beside her chair, and she
forgot herself and me as she poured out her woe and
trouble&mdash;poured them out until she was empty of
them, and their place was filled by the hope which I gave
her, the faith that I had&mdash;for the time, even the
<i>certainty</i> that I felt.</p>

<p>When she had finished, I took her little hand in both
mine, and looked into her eyes.</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> he is alive," I said. "I am as certain of it
as I am that we are here together. He is alive and I will
find him. I will not only find him but I will rescue him
and bring him back. <i>Alive and well, I will bring him back
to you....</i>"</p>

<p>And at that moment I believed what I said. There is no
such thing as "chance"; and God had not brought me to that
place for nothing&mdash;nor to make a mock of us for His
sport....</p>

<p>What Isobel told me on that golden English summer
afternoon&mdash;as I sat beside her chair, in a short-seen
Seventh Heaven of bitter happiness and sad joy, listening
to her voice with its soft accompaniment of the murmuring
of innumerable bees in immemorial elms&mdash;is indelibly
written on the tablets of my memory, and I can tell it
exactly as she told it to me. </p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="first">
"I shall tell you absolutely everything&mdash;right
from the beginning," whispered Isobel. "That is the least
I can do&mdash;after what you have just offered ... and
promised.... Everything, right from the beginning.... What
it was that caused them to disappear ... and caused their
deaths.... Oh, those splendid boys.... And John, my own
darling, John ..." and she wept anew.</p>

<p>"John is alive," I said. "And he's coming back to
you.... Believe me.... Trust in me...."</p>

<p>"I do," she answered. "Oh, I do.... You have given me
new life.... I always felt that you could and would do
anything that you promised.... I have always liked you so
much.... Otis....</p>

<p>"I'll tell you <i>everything</i>.... You would hardly believe
it.... You remember Claudia, of course?... The loveliest
girl...."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "'Queen Claudia of the Band.'... Michael
loved her very much, I think...."</p>

<p>"Michael worshipped her," agreed Isobel. "He would have
died for her.... He did die for her&mdash;in a way.... Poor
wonderful noble Beau.... It nearly broke John's heart. He
came back so different ... poor John. Michael and Digby
both.... Yes, John returned different in every way, except
in his love for me.... Oh, John!..."</p>

<p>"Michael and Digby <i>dead</i>?" I exclaimed. "<i>Beau Geste</i>
dead?..." This was horrible. What had happened?</p>

<p>"Yes, and Claudia is dead too," replied Isobel. "She was
Lady Frunkse. I expect you read that she married Sir Otto
Frunkse, 'the richest man in England.'... A motor-smash....
You must have seen it in the papers?... She lived&mdash;or
rather died&mdash;for three days.... Poor Claudia&mdash;she
was blinded and terribly disfigured by broken glass, and
her back was broken.... Her husband went out of his mind
for some time. He loved her passionately&mdash;and he had
bought her ... and he was driving the car ... and was not
quite sober....</p>

<p>"She asked for me on the last day. I was in the room
at the time.... She knew she was dying.... Her mind was
absolutely clear, and she did not want to die until
she had made a confession.... She asked me to tell
everybody&mdash;after her death. You are the only person I
have told.... I want you to know everything that concerns
John.... It was very dreadful.... Only her mouth was
exposed.... In that vast golden room and colossal Chinese
bed, poor lovely Claudia was merely a mouth. I knelt beside
her and held her poor groping hand and she whispered on and
on ... and on....</p>

<p>"I'll try to tell you.</p>

<p>"'<i>Is that you, Isobel?</i>' she said. '<i>There is no-one
else here, is there?... Listen.... Tell this to my
Mother&mdash;Aunt Patricia is my Mother&mdash;and to John
and Otto and George Lawrence, everybody&mdash;after I am
dead.... I cannot tell my Mother myself ... Digby knows,
now ... And poor little Augustus ... My Father knows too.
I think he knew at the time. The mad know things that the
sane do not.... Poor darling "Chaplain,"&mdash;we all loved
him, didn't we, Isobel?</i></p>

<p>"'<i>Didn't you love Beau too, Isobel?</i> Really <i>love him,
I mean.... I worshipped the ground he trod on.... But I was
only a girl&mdash;and bad.... I was</i> bad.... <i>Rotten.... I
loved money and myself. Yes, myself and money, more than I
loved Beau or anything else ... anyone else....</i></p>

<p>"'<i>And Otto had caught me.... Trapped me nicely ...
It served me right.... How I loathed him, and feared
him too&mdash;and I actually believed he would let me
be disgraced&mdash;let me go to prison&mdash;if I did
not either pay him or marry him!... It was more than two
thousand pounds ... It seemed like all the money in the
world to me, a girl of eighteen....</i></p>

<p>"'<i>And if I married him I should be saved&mdash;and
I should be the richest woman in England.... I thought
it was a choice between that and prison.... Otto made me
think it. I couldn't doubt it after he had sent his tame
solicitor to see me.... The awful publicity and disgrace
and shame....</i></p>

<p>"<i>'But Michael saved me&mdash;for a time.... He saved me
from everything and everyone&mdash;except from myself....
He couldn't save me from myself.... And when he was gone,
and Otto was tempting me and pestering me again, I gave way
and married him&mdash;or his money....</i></p>

<p>"<i>'Isobel, it was I who stole the "Blue Water"&mdash;the
mad fool and vile thief that I was.... I thought I could
sell it and pay what I owed Otto&mdash;and a dozen
others&mdash;dressmakers and people; shops in London.
I must have been mad&mdash;mad&mdash;with fear and
worry....</i></p>

<p>"<i>'Michael knew&mdash;before the lights came on
again....'</i>"</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Isobel broke off here and wiped tears from her
cheeks.</p>

<p>"I must tell you about that, Otis," she said. "You heard
about the great sapphire, 'Blue Water,' when you were at
Brandon Regis, I expect? It was kept in a casket in a safe
that stood in the Priests' Hole&mdash;and the Priests' Hole
is really undiscoverable. Its secret is never known to more
than three people, though scores of people are taken to see
the chamber. It is said that nobody has ever discovered the
trick of it, in four hundred years.</p>

<p>"Aunt Patricia used to show the 'Blue Water' to favoured
visitors, and sometimes she would have it out and let us
handle it and gloat over it. It lived on a white velvet
cushion under a thick glass dome in the steel casket.</p>

<p>"One night&mdash;it was not long before I last saw
you&mdash;we were sitting in the drawing-room, after
dinner, and Claudia asked Aunt Patricia if we might have
it down and look at it again. We hadn't seen it for ages.
The Chaplain&mdash;who was one of the three who knew the
secret of the Priests' Hole&mdash;went and got it, and we
all handled it and loved it. Then the Chaplain put it back
on its cushion and put the glass cover over it&mdash;and
suddenly the electric light failed, as it often used to do,
in those days.</p>

<p>"When the lights came on again&mdash;the 'Blue Water'
had disappeared.... Everyone denied having touched
it&mdash;and next day, Beau ran away from home.... Then
Digby disappeared.... Then John&mdash;and I was the most
miserable girl in England. He told me, quite unnecessarily,
that he had not stolen the wretched thing, and of course
we also knew that neither Beau nor Digby was capable of
theft.</p>

<p>"They joined the French Foreign Legion ... and ... and
... Michael was killed ... and Digby was killed ... but
John came back safe and sound&mdash;but <i>oh</i>, so changed
... and now ... <i>they have got him again</i>," and the poor
girl broke down and wept unrestrainedly.</p>

<p>"I'll bring him back," I said, keeping a powerful grip
upon myself, lest I put my arms about her, in my yearning
ache to comfort her. "I <i>know</i> I shall find him and bring
him back...."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;so do I," she smiled. "I believe it.... I
feel it's <i>true</i>.... God bless you.... I ... I can't ...
I...."</p>

<p>My eyes tingled.</p>

<p>"I'll finish telling you about Claudia," she said....
"Poor Claudia went on:</p>

<p>"'<i>Yes, Michael knew.... He came to my bedroom that
night.... I was in bed, wide awake, and in a dreadful state
of mind.... I felt awful.... Filthy from head to foot....
I was a thief and I had robbed my Aunt, my greatest
benefactress.... I did not then know that she was my
Mother&mdash;she only told me when the Chaplain died and
she was broken-hearted and distraught....</i></p>

<p>"<i>'Michael crept in like a ghost.</i></p>

<p>"'"C<small>LAUDIA</small>," <i>he whispered</i>, "<small>GIVE
ME THE </small>'B<small>LUE </small>W<small>ATER.</small>'
I<small> AM GOING TO PUT IT BACK. THE KEY IS IN THE BRASS
BOX ABOVE THE FIREPLACE IN THE HALL AS </small>A<small>UNT
SAID</small>."</p>

<p>"'<i>I pretended to be indignant&mdash;and talked like
the hypocrite and liar that I am. I ordered him out of the
room, and said I'd ring the bell and scream if he did not
go at once.</i></p>

<p>"'"C<small>LAUDIA</small>," <i>he said</i>, "<small>GIVE
IT TO ME, DEAR....</small> I<small>T WAS ONLY A JOKE,
OF COURSE....</small> L<small>ET ME PUT IT BACK,
</small>C<small>LAUDIA.... </small>N<small>O-ONE WILL DREAM
THAT IT WAS YOU WHO TOOK IT....</small>"</p>

<p>"'"<i>No-one but you, you horrible cad</i>," I said. "<i>How
dare you.... How could you....</i>"</p>

<p>"'"D<small>ON'T, DEAR</small>," <i>he begged....</i>
"D<small>ON'T.... </small>I<small> <i>KNOW</i>!...
</small>Y<small>OU BRUSHED CLOSE TO ME AS YOU MOVED
TO THE TABLE AND AS YOU RETURNED TO WHERE YOU WERE
STANDING.... </small>Y<small>OUR HAIR ALMOST TOUCHED

</small>I<small> WORSHIPPED YOU ALL THESE YEARS,
</small>C<small>LAUDIA, WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO READ YOUR
THOUGHTS?... </small>I<small> KNEW IT WAS YOU, AND
</small>I<small> WENT AND STOOD WITH MY HAND ON THE GLASS
SO THAT IT WOULD LOOK AS THOUGH </small>I<small> WAS IN
THE JOKE TOO, IF </small>I<small>SOBEL TURNED THE LIGHTS
ON WHILE YOU WERE PUTTING IT BACK.... </small>G<small>IVE
IT TO ME QUICKLY, DEAR&mdash;AND THE JOKE IS FINISHED....
OH, </small>C<small>LAUDIA DARLING, I DO LOVE YOU
SO&mdash;AND </small>I<small> HAD NOT MEANT TO TELL YOU
UNTIL YOU WERE OLDER.... </small>G<small>IVE IT ME, DEAREST
</small>C<small>LAUDIA....</small>"</p>

<p>"'<i>His voice came to me out of the darkness, like
that&mdash;and I was</i> racked, <i>Isobel.... I loved him, you
see.... And I loathed Otto, and I had to have two thousand
pounds or marry him&mdash;or go to prison&mdash;I verily
believed</i>.</p>

<p>"'<i>And I stood out against Michael, and
lied, and lied, and lied, and pretended to be
indignant&mdash;hurt&mdash;enraged&mdash;wounded ... and I
called him horrible names, and all we said was in dreadful
tense whispers.</i>'</p>

<p>"'"C<small>LAUDIA! </small>C<small>LAUDIA</small>!"
<i>he said</i>. "Y<small>OU CAN'T POSSIBLY DO IT....
</small>I<small> KNOW IT'S ONLY A JOKE&mdash;BUT DON'T
PLAY IT ANY FURTHER.... </small>I<small>F IT DOESN'T BRING

A <i>DANGEROUS</i> PRACTICAL JOKE TO PLAY ON A PERSON LIKE
</small>A<small>UNT </small>P<small>ATRICIA....</small>"</p>

<p>"'<i>And he begged and begged of me to give it to
him&mdash;and the more certain he was that I had got it,
the angrier I grew.... Isn't it incredible&mdash;and isn't
it exactly what a guilty person does?...</i></p>

<p>"'<i>At last he said:</i></p>

<p>"'"L<small>OOK HERE, THEN, </small>C<small>LAUDIA.
</small>I<small> AM GOING AWAY TO MY ROOM FOR AN
HOUR.... DURING THAT TIME THE </small>'B<small>LUE

GO DOWN MYSELF, LATER ON, AND SEE THAT IT IS THERE....
</small>S<small>PLENDID!... </small>G<small>OOD-NIGHT,
DARLING </small>C<small>LAUDIA ...</small>" <i>and he faded
away like a ghost</i>.</p>

<p>"'<i>I lay awake and lived through the worst night
of my life.... </i>I could <i>not go down and put it
back&mdash;tacitly confessing to Michael that I was a
thief.... I loved him so, and I valued his good opinion of
me more than anything&mdash;except my beastly self.... If
he had come back then, I should have given the horrible
stone to him.... I should ... And later I grew more and
more angry with him for suspecting me&mdash;and I got up
and locked my door and bolted it. At about four o'clock
in the morning I weakened and grew afraid of what I had
done.... I saw myself arrested by policemen.... Taken to
prison ... in the dock ... tried and sentenced to penal
servitude.</i></p>

<p>"'<i>I added cowardice to wickedness, and at last,
overcome by fear, I jumped out of bed, took the "Blue
Water" from the toe of a riding-boot where I had hidden it,
slipped on a dressing-gown and mules, and crept downstairs.
Every board seemed to creak, and my heart was in my mouth.
I dared not carry a candle nor switch on any lights.</i></p>

<p>"'<i>Every stair and board, I trod on, creaked and
groaned, and I felt that every soul in the house must
know what I was doing.... And suddenly I knew I was being
followed, and I think that perhaps that was the most
dreadful moment of my life.</i></p>

<p>"'"A<small>UNT </small>P<small>ATRICIA</small>,"<i>I
thought, and I nearly shrieked. I felt that if she turned
on the lights and caught me there, with the "Blue Water"
in my hand, I should scream myself insane.... And then a
cold hand touched me, and I did scream&mdash;or thought I
did&mdash;before I realized it was the hand of a man in
armour....</i></p>

<p>"'<i>And then my one need was to get rid of that awful
jewel. I rushed to the fireplace and fumbled at the high
mantel for the brass box in which Aunt Patricia had put the
key. I found it, and hurried on, to the drawing-room door.
The noise that I made in opening it sounded like thunder,
but by that time, all that I cared about was to be rid of
the sapphire, and back in my room before I was caught.
It didn't matter to me who was suspected of having taken
it....</i></p>

<p>"'<i>And as I reached the table on which the glass cover
stood, someone entered the room.</i></p>

<p>"'<i>Do you know, I believe my heart really stopped
beating as I waited for Aunt Patricia to switch the lights
on....</i></p>

<p>"'<i>And then a voice said</i>, "O<small>H, THANK
</small>G<small>OD, DARLING.... I KNEW YOU
WOULD....</small>"</p>

<p>"'<i>It was Michael.</i></p>

<p>"'<i>And in the sudden and utter revulsion of feeling, I
could have cursed him.... I had been so absolutely certain
that it was Aunt Patricia, that I was utterly enraged at
the fright he had given me....</i></p>

<p>"'<i>And can you believe that I turned about and marched
out of that room, to bed, without a word, still clutching
the "Blue Water" in my hand?... Later he came and tapped
softly and turned the handle. He stayed there for over an
hour, tapping gently with his finger-nails and turning the
handle.... And I lay there trying not to scream ... trying
to get up and give him the sapphire ... trying</i> not <i>to get
up and give him the sapphire.... And as the time wore on, I
got more and more frightened at what I had done.... In the
morning, I got up and went out into the rose-garden and he
came to me there.</i></p>

<p>"'"L<small>AST CHANCE, </small>C<small>LAUDIA
DEAR,</small>" <i>he said</i>. "G<small>IVE ME THE
</small>'B<small>LUE </small>W<small>ATER</small>'
<small>NOW, AND THERE SHAN'T BE A BREATH OF
SUSPICION ON YOU.... </small>I<small>F YOU DON'T,
IT IS ABSOLUTELY <i>CERTAIN</i> THAT YOU'LL GET INTO THE
GHASTLIEST TROUBLE. </small>A<small>UNT IS BOUND TO
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT.... </small>H<small>OW COULD

</small>A<small>ND SUSPICION WILL BE ON POOR LITTLE

CAN'T <i>POSSIBLY</i> SELL IT.... </small>G<small>IVE IT TO ME
AND </small>I'<small>LL GIVE YOU MY WORD NOBODY WILL EVER
<i>DREAM</i> THAT YOU....</small>"</p>

<p>"'<i>I burst into tears.... I had had such an awful
night, and I was so filled with anger and fear and</i>
hatred&mdash;<i>hatred of Michael and Otto and of all the
men in the world&mdash;that I broke down.... I nearly gave
it to him.... And after breakfast I did give it to him,
too late, and I told him I loathed him utterly, and that I
hoped that I should never set eyes on him again!... I never
did, Isobel, as you know.... And I have never had a happy
hour since...</i>'"</p>

<p>Isobel paused and wiped tears from her eyes. I would
have left her but that I felt it was good for her to talk
and get it all out.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"Poor, poor Claudia," she went on. "She died that night.
Sir Otto Frunkse went insane for a time. I thought Aunt
Patricia would die too. Claudia was all she had, after the
Chaplain died and Michael was killed.... She blamed herself
for the boys' deaths.... And now, John!... Oh, John!...
John!..."</p>

<p>"Why did she blame herself?" I asked. "Surely it was
Claudia's&mdash;er&mdash;act, that led to Michael's and
Digby's going away...?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you everything, as I said," replied Isobel.
"It's wonderful to have a Father Confessor and friend ...
and you are going to find John for me.... I <i>know</i> you
are.... I feel as though I were coming out of a tomb....
You have lifted the cover a little already.... I shall tell
you everything....</p>

<p>"Michael knew that Aunt Patricia had sold the real
'Blue Water'&mdash;sold it to the descendant of the
Rajah from whom it had been&mdash;acquired&mdash;by her
husband's ancestor, in India.... She had a right to
sell it, I believe, as her husband gave it to her as a
wedding-present.... This man, Sir Hector Brandon, used
to leave her for years at a time. He was a very bad
man&mdash;a bad husband and a bad landlord.... I know that
she put almost every penny of the money into the estate....
She had had a model of the 'Blue Water' made before she
parted with the original.... Michael ran away with this
model. He thought it would be a splendid way of covering up
what Claudia had done, and of what Aunt Patricia had done,
too&mdash;and Sir Hector was about to return to England....
Poor darling Michael&mdash;it was just what he <i>would</i>
do!... It must have seemed such a simple solution, to him,
and the end of terrible and dangerous trouble for the two
women he loved.... It saved Claudia from shame and disgrace
and from Aunt Patricia's anger, and it saved Aunt Patricia
from her husband's.... Sir Hector Brandon would simply
think that Michael had stolen the 'Blue Water,' and Aunt
Patricia would think that he had stolen the dummy&mdash;in
ignorance of its worthlessness." </p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p> <i>This Beau Geste!</i>... It was an honour and a boast to
have known him!... And those two women&mdash;that mother
and her daughter!... My God!... </p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p> "Uncle Hector never came home after all," continued
Isobel. "Nor Beau either.... Nor Digby.... And now,
<i>John</i>&mdash;my John!... Oh, Claudia, the trouble and
misery and tragedy you caused that night!..."</p>

<p>"Tell me about John," I said.</p>

<p>That would do her more good than anything.... I had
learnt from Dr. Hanley-Blythe, and from my own experience,
what repression can do to one!</p>

<p>"When Michael ran away, taking the suspicion and the
blame, and Digby followed him to share it, John felt that
he must go too. You see the three boys had always done
<i>everything</i> together, all their lives. And John felt
that they were shielding him because nobody would dream
of suspecting Claudia or me&mdash;and there was a reason
why Gussie should not be suspected. As a matter of fact,
I was in a position to prove his innocence&mdash;as well
as my own&mdash;for I had hold of his arm the whole time
that the room was in darkness.... So it was <i>John or
Claudia</i>&mdash;and John went.... Then it <i>must</i> be one of
the Geste boys....</p>

<p>"John felt certain that Michael had gone to the French
Foreign Legion because the very name of it had fascinated
him, ever since a French officer had stayed at Brandon
Abbas and told us about military life in Africa....
Why&mdash;you may have met him there!... De Beaujolais is
his name. He was the son of an old school-friend of Aunt
Patricia's and, at Eton, was the fag of George Lawrence,
her second husband...."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't see him at Brandon Abbas," I said. "But I
saw him in Africa, in a place called Zaguig.... He saved my
sister.... It's a queer little world...!"</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> a queer world ..." mused Isobel. "Think of
that!... You know Major de Beaujolais!..."</p>

<p>"Related to him," I smiled. "My sister married him.... I
mean he married my sister...."</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> a coincidence!" said Isobel.</p>

<p>"Not it!" I ventured to contradict. "There are no such
things!... It was no coincidence that Jasper Jocelyn Jelkes
ran away from Brandon Abbas and came to my Grandmother's
place ... nor that a Colonel Levasseur became enamoured of
my sister and invited us to Zaguig, with the result that I
got all broken up ... nor that Dr. Hanley-Blythe chanced
upon me when I was just enjoying the nervous reaction from
it!... Go on about John...."</p>

<p>"He went to the French Foreign Legion, and there he
found Beau and Digby as he had felt certain he would....
At the siege, by Arabs, of a fort at a place called
Zinderneuf, Beau was killed, and John stabbed the
Commandant of the fort, in self-defence.... The man had
heard that Beau and Digby and John were jewel-thieves and
had a huge diamond!... Digby wasn't at Zinderneuf. He came
with the relief-party and was sent into the empty fort.
He saw Beau's body reverently laid out, beside that of
the Commandant&mdash;who had John's bayonet through his
heart. He went half mad and set the place on fire and
escaped to look for John, because John wasn't among the
dead.... He soon found him, because John had done just the
same thing&mdash;dropped from the wall furthest from the
entrance, and had run to the nearest sand-dunes.... Then
two friends of theirs, scouting or patrolling on camels,
found them, and the four of them got away together....</p>

<p>"Then Digby was killed by a raiding party...."</p>

<p>Her voice broke again and there was silence.</p>

<p>"Poor darling Digby.... He was such a kind, happy,
<i>dear</i> boy.... And after awful hardships and dangers, just
when escape seemed sure, the other three were stranded in
the desert without camels.... And they only had about a
quart of water.... And one of the two friends, one they
called 'Hank,' went off in the night ... to give John and
the other man a chance ... the water....</p>

<p>"Then John and the other&mdash;'Buddy,' John called
him&mdash;got to a desert village and they stayed there
a long time, hoping to find the third man or to hear
something of him.... He had given his life for them.... And
at last they gave up hope, and found a caravan going south
to Kano.... There they got into touch with George Lawrence,
who was a Commissioner or something, in Nigeria....</p>

<p>"And as soon as they were there, John's companion turned
round and went back to look for the lost man&mdash;Hank....
They were a sort of David and Jonathan pair, and the man
said he was going to search until either he found his
friend or died....</p>

<p>"John was too ill to go back with this man, Buddy.... I
have no doubt he would have done so, otherwise, as soon as
they had got camels and supplies.... Men do such foolish
things.... But John went down with enteric, and nearly
died. As soon as it was safe to move him, George Lawrence
brought him home.... Oh, I nearly died of joy, although I
cried and cried when I heard about Michael and Digby....</p>

<p>"And we were married.... And I was the happiest woman
in the whole world ... for a time. I was <i>too</i> happy, of
course.... We aren't meant to be as happy as I was, or we
shouldn't want to go to Heaven...."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we are," I interrupted, "and you are going to
be just as happy as that again. And it's <i>going to last</i>,
this time...."</p>

<p>Isobel sighed and pressed my hand as she smiled
gratefully at me.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I was too happy," she resumed, "but it did
not last very long.... John did not recover properly. He
simply did not get fit again.... He had had a most terrible
time.... The deaths of Beau and Digby before his eyes, and
the awful hardships he had suffered, ending up with this
enteric or typhus, when he was so weak.... George Lawrence
said he looked like a dying skeleton when he first saw him
in Nigeria.... And even then of course, he couldn't get
proper nursing or invalid food.... It was a marvel that he
lived.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;we hadn't been married long, before I saw
there was something very wrong with John.... He hardly ate
anything at all, and he scarcely slept.... I don't think
he ever got any sleep at all, at night. I used to hear
him walking up and down, up and down, in the corridor.
He would go out there so that he should not wake me, and
then he would sit in his dressing-room and smoke for a
while and read. He used to be able to doze a little in the
afternoons, and I would make him sit in a long chair under
the trees in the Bower&mdash;you know&mdash;where we used
to play.... I couldn't get him to go to bed in the daytime,
as he ought to have done.</p>

<p>"And if he fell asleep in the chair, he had horrible
dreams and woke with a dreadful start, or else he would
talk all the time.... That was how I found out what was
really at the root of the trouble. He felt he had left his
friend in the lurch&mdash;had deserted the man who would
never have deserted him, abandoned the David who had gone
back into the desert to look for his Jonathan instead of
escaping when he had the chance....</p>

<p>"I was so worried and frightened that I got Dr.
Hanley-Blythe to come to Brandon Abbas. He wanted John to
come here and be under observation, but John wouldn't hear
of it....</p>

<p>"Then one night, John was walking up and down in his
dressing-room, and, as I was going to him, I heard him say,
groaning, '<i>I shall go mad if I don't go back!</i>'... I made
up my mind immediately, and as I pushed the door wider
open, I said:</p>

<p>"'<i>John, darling, I know what is the matter with you</i>,'
just as though I had had a sudden brain-wave. He stared at
me. My heart seemed to turn right over&mdash;he looked so
ill and so unlike himself, too&mdash;and I felt absolutely
dreadful at the thought of what I was going to do....</p>

<p>"'<i>You must go back, darling</i>,' I said ... '<i>and find
them.... I shall come with you&mdash;as far as Kano
anyhow.</i>'... I meant to stay with him and never let him
out of my sight, of course.... He stared and stared as
though he could not believe his ears&mdash;and then his
poor sad face lit up with joy, and I thought my heart would
break.</p>

<p>"'Isobel!' he said, and took me in his arms as though
he loved me more than ever, for what I had done. '<i>You
see they may be alive ... they may be slaves ... they may
be in some ghastly native prison ... they may be in some
place where they'll have to stay for the rest of their
lives, for want of camels.... Isobel&mdash;they offered
their lives for Digby and me when they helped us away from
Zinderneuf.... Hank gave his life for Buddy and me when he
went off in the night, and left us the drop of water....
Buddy saw me safe to Kano before he went back to look for
Hank.... And I left them there, and am living in safety and
luxury!... They may be alive.... There may be time to save
them even yet.... I can't sleep for thinking of them ... in
Arab hands....</i>'</p>

<p>"'<i>We'll start as soon as you like, John</i>,' I
said&mdash;and I felt myself going dead, as it
were&mdash;dead and cold at the very heart of
myself...."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>There was silence for a while, a silence broken only by
a little sob, and I looked away over the beautiful Kentish
scene. Should I let her go on? Was it too painful to be
beneficial, or was it her salvation?...</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"You are distressing yourself," I said, moved
almost unbearably by her tears.... "Tell me the rest
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no! Let me tell you now.... If you are
not&mdash;tired.... Oh, if you knew the relief it is ...
and the hope that you have given me ... my friend-in-need
..." she answered at once.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"George Lawrence was wonderful," she went on, "and Aunt
Patricia did not raise a word of protest when he said
he would come with us.... Of course, his help would be
absolutely invaluable. He was in Nigeria for about twenty
years, himself, and could pull all sorts of strings, give
us the soundest advice and assist us in numberless ways....
I think that Aunt Patricia realized it was a life-and-death
matter for John, especially after what Dr. Hanley-Blythe
had said to her.... What I did not then realize, was that
George Lawrence's real object was to take charge of <i>me</i>,
if anything happened to John when he went off into the
real desert, right away from civilization and help.... He
never expected that John would return alive, and he did
not expect that John would ever get better if he did not
go....</p>

<p>"Do you know, John began to improve from that
night&mdash;from the very moment that I had suggested his
going back.... He went to bed and slept, and I heard him
singing in his bath, the next morning!... Several times
during that day he actually whistled as he went about his
preparations for the journey. He was a changed man, and I
got some idea of what he had suffered by sitting idle while
his friends whom he had 'deserted' might be dying in the
desert, or be living in captivity worse than death....</p>

<p>"On the voyage from Liverpool to Lagos, he put on weight
daily, and was almost himself again by the time we got
there.... And then he revealed the plot hatched by George
Lawrence!</p>

<p>"We were to go to friends of his, and I was to stay with
them while John and he went on to Kano. After he had seen
John off, with a proper caravan&mdash;to go to the village
where he and his friend had lived while they had been
searching for the third man&mdash;George was to return to
me and take me home again!... These two precious lunatics
thought I was going to agree to <i>that</i>&mdash;and sit down
quietly with George's friends for weeks and weeks, and then
go quietly home without John.</p>

<p>"'Oh, yes,' they said, 'George's friends are most
delightful people; have a charming house in quite the best
part of Nigeria; really very good climate at this time of
year; plenty going on, at the Club; tennis, racing, polo,
bridge and dancing; I should have a lovely time....'</p>

<p>"I didn't argue. I merely smiled and shook my head.</p>

<p>"When they realized, at last, that I was going with
John, and that nothing on earth would stop my going with
John, there was frightful consternation and alarm! They
even talked of abandoning the whole scheme and returning
by the next boat.... I wouldn't hear of that, and they
wouldn't hear of my attempting to make the caravan-journey
into that part of the Sahara, one of the most waterless,
hot and dangerous of deserts.... We compromised
eventually.... I was to come with them to Kano, and John
was to go on with the best guides, camels, camel-men,
outfit and provisions that money could buy. He was to take
special men, as messengers, too. He was to send a man
back with a message, as soon as he reached the village,
and send messages at regular intervals afterwards.... The
men were to report to an English official at Kano, a Mr.
Mordaunt&mdash;an old friend of George Lawrence, and he
would cable news to us.... John promised that he would not
go further north than Zanout, himself.... His idea was to
promise a big reward to anybody who brought him genuine
news, and he hoped to get into touch with one or two big
men, Arab or Touareg chiefs, who are famous and influential
in that part of the Sahara.... And to tell the great
Bilma salt-caravan&mdash;thousands of people&mdash;about
it....</p>

<p>"John thought that the 'desert telegraph'&mdash;that
mysterious spreading of news which turns even the desert
into a whispering-gallery&mdash;would soon make it known,
far and wide, that a great sum was being offered by a rich
European for news of two friends of his.... All sorts of
<i>canards</i> would soon be flying about, and hundreds of
false clues would be discovered.... And among tons and
tons of chaff there might, one day, be found a grain of
truth....</p>

<p>"Poor John!... Oh, my darling John!... He was so
hopeful.... He was so happy again, now that he was, at any
rate, <i>trying</i> to do something for his friends&mdash;if
only they were still alive.... There was hope that the
second one was, and just a bare chance that the first one
had been found and saved."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"You are tiring yourself," I said again, as Isobel fell
silent.</p>

<p>"No, no! Let me finish&mdash;unless you are tired
yourself," she replied. "It does me good to tell you ...
and the sooner you know everything, the sooner you may be
able to do something...."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"John got to the place, where he had lived with his
companion, in about three weeks, and sent back the first
messenger. Nothing was known there, apparently, but he had
hardly expected to get news so soon, and was still full
of hope. Two more messages came, the second from Zanout,
where he thought he had found a trace of the man he called
'Buddy.'... It seems the Touareg of those parts know the
appearance and brand-marks of every camel, and the full
history of every raid in which camels are stolen. John
thought that Buddy and his caravan had been captured by
Touareg or Tebu robbers, and the next thing was to find
somebody who could give details as to the band and where
they came from, and whether there had been any survivors of
the caravan....</p>

<p>"And then ... And then ... We got a cable from George
Lawrence's Kano friend, <i>saying that John himself had been
captured</i>!... Not by raiders.... He had been recognized by
a French patrol and had been arrested.... Oh John, John,
dear!... I let you go back there&mdash;but you would have
died if you had stayed here...."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>I could do nothing to comfort her&mdash;except reiterate
my promise to find him and bring him back.</p>

<p>"George Lawrence was splendid again," she continued.
"He took me back to Africa.... I would have gone alone if
necessary.... Before going, he moved heaven and earth....
He went to the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office
and to see several Members of Parliament and visited the
offices of the London newspapers. Then he got into touch
with his friend, Major de Beaujolais&mdash;who was at our
wedding and knew all about John.... We went to Paris, and
he saw various influential people there, and thence to
Algiers to see the Commander-in-Chief.... Everybody was
most kind and sympathetic and helpless&mdash;especially
helpless in France and Africa.... '<i>Nothing could
be done.... The law must take its course.... We
civilian officials cannot interfere with the military
authorities.... We military officials cannot interfere
with the civilian authorities.... Fair trial, of
course.... Court martial.... Death penalty generally
inflicted&mdash;very properly&mdash;in cases of desertion
in the face of the enemy.... Some very peculiar features
about this case moreover</i>'... and so-on.</p>

<p>"It was unspeakably dreadful to feel so powerless,
baffled and ineffectual.... I felt I must get as near as
I possibly could to the place&mdash;in Africa.... I must
have every scrap of news.... I lasted out&mdash;as far as
Kano.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mordaunt was so kind and helpful. He had kept the
man who had brought the last information&mdash;a Touareg
camel-driver, hired in Kano.... This man had told the whole
story to George Lawrence, over and over again.... They had
found a soldier of the French camel-corps, who had strayed
or deserted from a patrol&mdash;apparently what they call
a <i>peloton méhariste</i>, out on a <i>tournée d'apprivoisement</i>
through the Touareg country.... John had befriended the
man, of course&mdash;given him food, water and a camel, and
the man had gone straight off and brought the patrol down
on his benefactor....</p>

<p>"From what this camel-man said, George Lawrence and
Mr. Mordaunt concluded that the soldier had recognized
John and had denounced him, for reward and promotion,
or else&mdash;having had enough of desertion in the
desert&mdash;to ingratiate himself with the leader of the
patrol and palliate his offence....</p>

<p>"Anyhow, what was perfectly clear, was that John had
been captured and arrested in French Territory by the
'competent military authority'&mdash;as a deserter from the
Legion....</p>

<p>"<i>Oh John, John, my darling!... Shall I ever see you
again!...</i></p>

<p>"And when I had learned everything there was to learn at
Kano, I collapsed altogether, and only just didn't die....
I think it was the belief that I might, somehow, be able
to help John, that kept me alive.... It must have been
a dreadful time for poor George Lawrence.... I remember
very little about it, but I get fleeting glimpses now and
again....</p>

<p>"And here I am, Otis ... and can do <i>nothing</i>.
Everything possible has been done&mdash;and all we know,
through the kindness of Major de Beaujolais, is that he
is alive&mdash;or was&mdash;and is a convict in the Penal
Battalions in Africa!... Eight years!... And then to
return to the Legion to finish his five years there!...
<i>Eight years!</i> He couldn't survive eight months of that
life.... And here am I&mdash;and I can do <i>nothing</i> ...
<i>nothing</i>...."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> can, though," I said, and arose to begin doing it.
</p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p> A week later, I was in Sidi bel Abbès&mdash;an earnest
and indefatigable student of Arabic and of all matters
pertaining to the French Foreign Legion and to the French
Penal Battalions of convicts, as well&mdash;the "Zephyrs"
or "Joyeux."</p>

<p>A fortnight later, I was an enlisted <i>légionnaire</i> of
the French Foreign Legion, and, secretly, a candidate for
membership of the Zephyrs.</p>

<p>It was my intention to see the inside of Biribi*, the
famous or infamous convict depôt of the Penal Battalions,
and only by way of the Legion could I do so. Thence, and
only thence, could I possibly find John Geste, and until I
found him, neither I nor anybody else could rescue him. </p>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="first">
I have very rarely found anything as good as I
expected it to be, and almost never as bad. If the joys
of anticipation are generally greater than those of
experience, the terrors are almost always so, and the
man who said, "We suffer far more from the calamities
that never happen to us, than from those that do," talked
sense.</p>

<p>I had expected life in the French Foreign Legion to be
so rough, so hard, so wholly distasteful from every point
of view, that I had anticipated something much worse than
the reality.</p>

<p>It was hard, very hard; it was rough, wearisome,
monotonous and wholly unpleasant; but it was bearable.</p>

<p>I don't think I could have faced the prospect of
five years of it&mdash;unless, of course, it were for
Isobel&mdash;but as things were, I contrived to carry on
from day to day.</p>

<p>What made things worse for me than for some people, was
the fact that I had no military leaning whatsoever, and
that the soldier's trade is the very last one that I should
voluntarily adopt.</p>

<p>Of course, if one's country is at war, and there is need
of more men than the standing army provides, one is fully
prepared to learn the soldiering trade, to the end that
one may be as useful as possible as quickly as possible.
But this was different, and to me, at any rate, the whole
business seemed puerile, stupid, and an entirely unsuitable
occupation for an intelligent man.</p>

<p>There was not one solitary aspect of life that was
enjoyable, and I do not think that I was ever faintly
interested in anything but the <i>salle d'honneur</i>.</p>

<p>This wonderful museum of military trophies and of
concrete evidence of superhuman courage, devotion and
endurance, did more than interest me. It thrilled me to the
marrow of my bones, and I took every opportunity of gazing
at the battle pictures, portraits of distinguished heroes,
scenes from the Legion's stirring history&mdash;all of
them, without exception, painted by legionaries who were
survivors of the scenes depicted&mdash;or comrades of the
men whose portraits adorned the walls.</p>

<p>Every captured standard, weapon, and other trophy,
illustrated some astounding story, a story as true as Life
and Death, and far, far stranger than any fiction that ever
was conceived.</p>

<p>The single exhibit that thrilled me most was, I
think, the hand of Captain Danjou in its glass case
beneath the picture that told the story of the historic
fight of sixty-five against two thousand two hundred
better-provided troops; a fight that lasted a whole day,
and ended in the capture, by assault, of five wounded
survivors&mdash;wounded to death, but fighting while
strength remained to load a gun and pull a trigger.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>What I suffered from, most of all, was a lack of
companionship. There wasn't a comrade to whom I could talk
English, and none to whom I cared to talk French, or what
passed for French, in the Legion.</p>

<p>Stout fellows all, no doubt, and good soldiers, but
there was not one with whom I had an idea in common, or
who appeared to have a thought beyond wine, woman and
song, unless it were food, money and the wickedness of
non-commissioned officers.</p>

<p>One of my room-mates, a poor creature named Schnell,
who appeared to me to be not only the butt and fool of the
<i>escouade</i>, but also of Fate, attached himself to me and
made himself extremely useful.</p>

<p>For some inexplicable reason, he developed a great
admiration for me. He put himself under my protection, and
in return for that, and some base coin of the realm, he
begged to remain my obedient servant, and was permitted to
do so.</p>

<p>I was to meet the good Schnell again&mdash;in different
circumstances.</p>

<p>Things improved somewhat when, after some weeks, I
completed my recruit's course, took my place in my Company
and came under the more immediate notice of Sergeant
Frederic. </p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p> I did not look upon it as a piece of great good luck
when I found that my Sergeant was an Englishman, and one
of the best of good fellows. I regarded it rather as a
Sign.</p>

<p>I never knew his real name, but he was a Public School
man, had been through Sandhurst, and had served in a
Dragoon regiment. How he had fallen from the Officers' Mess
of a British Cavalry regiment to the ranks of the Legion,
was a mystery, for he was one of those people in whom
one cannot detect a weak spot, and with whom one cannot
associate any form of vice or crime.</p>

<p>I often wondered.</p>

<p>It may have been debt, a love affair, or sheer boredom
with peace-time soldiering, and I often hoped that he would
one day be moved to tell me his story. Naturally I never
asked him a question on the subject of his past. It can't
be done in the Legion.... Not twice, anyhow.</p>

<p>Of course, a Sergeant cannot hob-nob with a
<i>légionnaire</i>, walk out with him or drink with him, but
Sergeant Frederic, as he called himself, gave me many a
friendly word and kindly encouragement when we were alone;
and later, when we were away down in the desert, he would
march beside me and talk, or come and chat in the darkness
of bivouacs. On one occasion, when he and I were in the
same mule-<i>peloton</i>, he and I were out on a patrol, or a
<i>reconnaissance</i>, by ourselves, for a whole day, and he
laid aside his rank and we talked freely, as equals, and
man to man. It did us both good to talk English once again,
and to converse with a man of our own level of education,
social experience and breeding.</p>

<p>It made all the difference in the world, to me, that
my Sergeant was a man of this type, and regarded me with
the eye of friendship and favour. Moreover it was not
unnoticed by the Corporals that I was a compatriot (as they
supposed), and something of a protégé of the Sergeant.</p>

<p>Had I, at that time, proved a slack and inefficient
soldier however, I am pretty sure there would have been
a prompt end to the favour of Sergeant Frederic and his
myrmidons.</p>

<p>Thanks to this position of affairs, I did not in the
early days, have too bad a time in the Legion. It was
hard, terribly hard, and I was only just equal to the
life, physically speaking, when real marching began in
earnest, and I took part in some of those performances
that have earned the Legion the honourable title of "The
Foot-Cavalry" in the XIXth (African) Army Corps.</p>

<p>At first I used to be obsessed with the awful fear that
I should fail and fall out, and share the terrible fate
of so many who have fallen by the wayside in Algeria and
Morocco. But it is wonderful how the spirit rules the body,
and for how long the latter will not give in, if the former
does not....</p>

<p>Time after time, in the early days, I was reduced
to a queer condition wherein I was dead, not "from the
neck, up," as we say, but from the neck, down. My head
was alive, my eyes could see, my ears hear, but I had no
body. My head floated along on a Pain. No, I had no body
and I was not conscious of individual parts that had been
causing me agony for hours&mdash;blistered feet, aching
calves, burning thighs, cruelly lame back, cut shoulders.
These were amalgamated into the one great amorphous and
intangible Pain that floated along in the white-hot cloud
of dust, and bore my bursting head upon it.</p>

<p>I used to think that I could be shot, when in that
condition, without knowing it and without falling, provided
that no vital part were hit, and that I should go on
marching, marching, marching....</p>

<p>For, once I had reached this condition, I was
almost immune and immortal, indestructible and
unstoppable&mdash;while the spirit held, high and
unfaltering. But when the last "<i>Halte!</i>" was cried, and
the voice of an officer rang out:</p>

<p>"<i>Campez</i>," and the Company Commanders bawled:</p>

<p>"<i>Formez les faisceaux</i>," and "<i>Sac à terre</i>," and the
unfaltering spirit went off duty, its task accomplished,
then the poor body had its way.... It trembled ... it
sagged ... it collapsed ... and it lay where it was,
until kindly and more seasoned comrades dragged it aside
and disposed its unconscious head in safety if not in
comfort.</p>

<p>I fully and freely admit that this marching was the
worst thing that I encountered in the Legion, thanks to my
good luck in being in Sergeant Frederic's <i>peloton</i>. The
next worst things were the lack of acceptable companionship
and society, the deadly wearisome monotony, and the
impossibility of natural self-expression for one's ego. I
am no militarist, no "born soldier," and I wished at times
that I had never been born at all.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>It was on the occasion to which I have referred, the
day when Sergeant Frederic and I were alone together,
from before dawn to after midnight, that I asked him
the question which probably surprised him more than any
other that he had ever been asked.... We were riding at
ease&mdash;so far as one can ride at ease on a mule....</p>

<p>"How can a man who wishes to do so, make certain
of getting sent to the Zephyrs?" I inquired suddenly.
"Just that and nothing worse&mdash;nor better ... the
happy medium between a death-sentence from a General
Court-martial, and thirty days' solitary confinement from
the Colonel."...</p>

<p>Sergeant Frederic laughed.</p>

<p>"The <i>happy</i> medium!" he said.... "Well&mdash;they're
called the '<i>Joyeux</i>'! You're a queer chap, Hankinson....
D'you mean you <i>want</i> to join the honourable <i>Compagnies de
discipline</i>? Don't you get enough discipline here?" and he
laughed again.... "Well&mdash;I dunno&mdash;I suppose you'd
find yourself in the Zephyrs all-right if you gave me a
smack in the eye, on parade, one morning...."</p>

<p>That was a thing I most certainly should not
do&mdash;and I little thought, at the time, that it would
actually be through this most excellent chap that I should
come to wear the military-convict uniform of the African
Penal Battalions....</p>

<p>"Better not risk it, though," he continued, smiling. "It
is much more likely that you'd be shot, out of hand....
It is the law, even in peace time, that the death-penalty
be awarded for the striking of any <i>supérieur</i>, no matter
what the provocation&mdash;and no matter what the rank of
the striker or the stricken.... And you know the awkward
rule of the French Army, '<i>No man can appeal against a
punishment until he has served the whole of it.</i>'"</p>

<p>"Yes.... Plenty of fellows do get sent from the Legion
to the Zephyrs, though," I said. "What's the trouble
usually?..."</p>

<p>"You've got Zephyrs on the brain," was the reply. "Are
you afraid you'll get sent there?... Not the slightest fear
of that, unless you wilfully get into serious trouble....
What do men get sent there for? Oh, insubordination,
desertion, damage to Government property, sedition&mdash;or
just continued slackness and indiscipline.... The Colonel
can give six months for that, and the General Court-martial
can give you penal servitude, to any extent, for a
serious 'crime' or continued bad record.... Those who get
themselves a term in the Zephyrs earn it all-right, and
thoroughly deserve it, as a rule.... Almost always.... As
far as I can remember the wording in Army Regulations, it
is, '<i>The Minister of War has full power to send to the
Compagnies de Discipline any soldier who has committed
one of several faults, the gravity of which makes any
other mode of repression inadequate....</i>' I like that word
'repression'!... They <i>repress</i> them all-right, in the
Penal Battalions!... Of course, 'Minister of War,' in this
case, means the General Court-martial that sits at Oran,
and the General Court-martial knows that when the Colonel
sends a man before it, something has got to be done with
the sin-merchant.</p>

<p>"So they either shoot him, or plant him in the Zephyrs
for a few years, and the Colonel is rid of him....</p>

<p>"Naturally the Colonel doesn't want to lose any man
who is a ha'porth of good&mdash;so you may take it a
<i>légionnaire's</i> a pretty hard case and a Republic's
Hard Bargain before he gets as far as the General
Court-martial."</p>

<p>"Yes," I agreed.... "But one hears stories of innocent,
harmless and well-meaning fellows who fall foul of a
Corporal or a Sergeant, and are so constantly run in, by
the non-com., that the Company Officer has to take notice
of it, and begins doubling the dose that he finds put down
in the <i>livre de punitions</i> against the man's name.... By
the time the Captain has begun to give the maximum that
his powers allow, the Colonel has got his eye on the poor
devil, and starts doubling the Captain's dose, and, before
long, the man has got the Colonel's maximum of solitary
confinement and an ultimatum&mdash;reform, or six months
deportation to the Zephyrs.... And he can't 'reform,' for
the Sergeant won't let him&mdash;and it's the Sergeant's
word against his...."</p>

<p>"One <i>does</i> hear such stories..." said Sergeant
Frederic, and changed the conversation. </p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p> The days passed swiftly&mdash;swiftly as only days of
continuous hard work can do, and I began to find myself
becoming a routine-dulled <i>légionnaire</i>, with so much
to do in the present that I could scarcely think of the
future.</p>

<p>This would not do, and I must get action. I had not come
to the Legion to settle down, serve my time, and take my
discharge! It appeared unlikely that there was anything
more about John Geste, for me to learn, and it was high
time that I decided on the course which I should pursue
to achieve my safe transfer from the honourable ranks
of the Foreign Legion to the dishonourable ranks of the
working-gangs of the Zephyrs.</p>

<p>The great question was&mdash;should I embark on a
course of slackness, insubordination, petty "crime" and
general unsatisfactoriness, so that by the thorny path of
more and more punishment, and increasingly long and heavy
sentences of imprisonment, I should sound to their depths
the Colonel's powers of "repression," until I touched the
very bottom and was repressed from the regiment altogether
for the space of six months&mdash;or should I conceive,
and then commit, some crime for which no punishment was
adequate, save such as could only be awarded by a General
Court-martial&mdash;to wit, penal servitude or Death.</p>

<p>On the one hand, it would be a long and painful&mdash;a
most distasteful and degrading&mdash;business, to play the
bad soldier so sedulously that I went through the whole
gamut of regimental punishment until the Colonel sent me to
the Zephyrs for six months&mdash;a disgrace to my Corps, my
country, and myself.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it would be unspeakably tragic,
if, in attempting to qualify for penal servitude
in the Zephyrs, I overdid it, and earned the
death-penalty&mdash;thus failing in my task of finding John
Geste; depriving Isobel of her last chance of happiness;
ending in a felon's grave all the high hopes that I had
held out to her; and breaking the fine promises that I had
made.</p>

<p>In favour of the first course was its comparative
safety.</p>

<p>Against it, was its protracted misery and moral
abasement, and also the fact that the six months which
the Colonel could and would give me, might prove all too
short for my purpose&mdash;indeed would almost certainly
prove too short. Twenty years would probably not be long
enough.</p>

<p>In favour of the second course, was its comparative
decency and brevity. A serious military "crime," a
Court-martial, a sentence.</p>

<p>Against it, was the possibility of the sentence being a
death-sentence.</p>

<p>Which to choose?... I wondered whether, ever before,
in the long and astounding history of the French Foreign
Legion, a man had deliberately endeavoured to earn a
sentence in the Penal Battalions, and had solemnly weighed
the respective merits and conveniences of a Colonel's
short-term sentence, and a Court-martial's penal servitude
decree. </p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p> I hate to look back upon the period of my life that
now began. It was, in a way, almost a worse time than
that which I spent in the actual Penal Battalion&mdash;as
much worse as mental suffering is than physical
suffering&mdash;for the misery of the constant punishment
and imprisonment that I deliberately brought upon myself,
was nothing in comparison with what I suffered in <i>earning</i>
that punishment.</p>

<p>I loathed myself; I loathed the thing that I had to
make myself appear to be&mdash;insubordinate, dirty,
untrustworthy, lazy, incompetent and wholly detestable to
the normal military mind. What hurt me most, was Sergeant
Frederic's disappointment in me, a hurt and bewildered
disappointment that quickly turned to scorn and the
bitterest contempt.</p>

<p>When I first began to lapse from grace&mdash;which was
as soon as I had decided that I would lapse by slow degrees
and a gradual slipping down Avernus, rather than by the
commission of a General Court-martial crime&mdash;the good
fellow did his best, by light punishment, by appeal to
my better nature, and then by sharp punishment&mdash;to
stay my downward course. He would send for me when I had
completed eight days <i>salle de police</i> or some other
punishment, and talk to me for my good.</p>

<p>"Look here, Hankinson," he would say, "what's the
game?... You're in the Legion and you've got to stay in
the Legion for five years, so why not make the best of
it, and of yourself? Why not go for promotion? You could
rise to Sergeant-Major and re-enlist for a commission....
And&mdash;other things apart&mdash;you might play the game,
since you <i>have</i> come here!... And I thought you were such
a decent chap....</p>

<p>"It's bad enough when some of these ignorant
unintelligent clods are bad, dirty, and drunken soldiers.
For a man like you, it isn't decent.... I can't make you
out, Hankinson.... One of the weaklings with a screw loose
somewhere, I suppose.... Come man, pull yourself together
... for the credit of the Anglo-Saxon name, if for nothing
else.... Dismiss!..."</p>

<p>And I would salute, and go, without a word, but with a
bursting heart.</p>

<p>Yes, what I was doing now <i>was</i>, undoubtedly, by far the
hardest of the things I was privileged to do for Isobel.
</p>

<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p> But, one day, a ray of light and warmth shone into the
dark cheerlessness of my life at this period.</p>

<p>Sergeant Frederic had an idea.</p>

<p>He wasn't a brilliant man, but he was one of those sound
solid, sensible Britishers who are richly endowed with that
uncommon thing, common sense.</p>

<p>He sent for me, and said, as soon as we were alone,
"I've come to the conclusion, Hankinson, that for some
reason, best known to yourself, you are deliberately
trying to get into the Zephyrs!... If so, you're a damned
fool&mdash;a mad fool.... But I can understand a mad fool,
if there's a woman in it....</p>

<p>"What I want to say is, I shall punish you exactly
according to your deserts&mdash;without mercy.... But if
you are trying to get into the Zephyrs, perhaps you'd
better give me a smack in the eye, on parade, and get it
over...."</p>

<p>"And now get to Hell out of this," he concluded, with an
eloquent handshake.</p>

<p> . . . . . . . . .</p>

<p>Fate was in a slightly ironical mood when all my painful
efforts to deserve and attain a Court-martial, were
rendered superfluous.</p>

<p>A sand-storm&mdash;aided by a brief failure
of the commissariat, over-fatigue, and frayed
nerves&mdash;provided me, without effort on my part, with
that for which I had schemed and suffered for months.</p>

<p>The battalion formed part of a very large force engaged
on some extensive manoeuvres, which were, I believe,
partly a training-exercise for field-officers, partly a
demonstration for the benefit of certain tribes, and partly
a reconnaissance in force.</p>

<p>My Company was broken up into a chain of tiny outpost
groups, widely scattered in a line parallel to the course
of a dry river-bed which was believed by the more ignorant
legionaries to form a rough boundary between Algeria and
Morocco.</p>

<p>Small patrols kept up communication between the
river-bed frontier line and these groups, and one day I
found myself a member of such a patrol.</p>

<p>As it happened, the rest of the <i>escouade</i> consisted
entirely of Russians, with the exception of my friend Rien,
a Frenchman, and a couple of Spaniards and a Jew. All the
Russians were in a clique, except Badineff, who hated the
others.</p>

<p>This man, Badineff, a huge, powerful fellow, was a
gentleman, and was commonly supposed to have commanded a
regiment of Cossacks. After his third bottle of wine, he
would talk of his "children," and say there were no cavalry
in the world to compare with them.... "My regiment would
ride round a whole brigade of Spahis, while it galloped,
and then ride through it and back."... After his fourth
bottle he would lapse into Russian, and further revelations
were lost to his interested audience.</p>

<p>Badineff had re-enlisted in the Legion twice, was now
serving his fifteenth year in the ranks, and must have been
about sixty years of age.</p>

<p>He spoke perfect English, French and German, and had
certainly seen a great deal of life&mdash;and of death
too.</p>

<p>The other Russians were "intellectuals," political
plotters and refugees&mdash;a loathsome gang, foul as
hyenas and cowardly as village pariah-dogs.</p>

<p>Our patrol started from bivouac, after a sleepless
night, long before the red dawn of a very terrible
day&mdash;one of those days when a most terrific
thunderstorm is always just about to break, and never does
so.</p>

<p>By one of those unfortunate concatenations of untoward
circumstance that render the operations of warfare an
uncertain and much over-rated pastime, we had to start
with almost nothing in our water-bottles, less in our
haversacks, and least in our stomachs.</p>

<p>Sergeant Frederic, however, comforted us with the
information that our march was to be but a short
one&mdash;about ten <i>kilomètres</i>&mdash;and that the outpost
to which we were going was actually holding a well,
water-hole or oasis, and was properly provisioned.</p>

<p>All we had to do, was to step out smartly, arrive
promptly, eat, drink and be merry, and then lie like
warriors taking our rest with our martial cloaks around
us.</p>

<p>It was Sergeant Frederic who lied.</p>

<p>The post was quite thirty kilometres away, and we had
marched about twenty of them, through the most terrible
heat I have ever known, when the sand-storm came on, and we
were lost.</p>

<p>It began with a wind that seemed to have come straight
from the opened mouth of Hell. It was so hot that it hurt,
and one laid one's hand over one's face as though to save
it from being burnt from the bones behind it. Dust clouds
arose in such density as to obscure the mid-day sun. As the
wind increased to hurricane force, the dust was mingled
with sand and small stones that cut the flesh, and, before
long, gloom became darkness.</p>

<p>We staggered on, Sergeant Frederic leading, and in
every mind was the thought, "How can he know where he
is going?... We shall be lost in the desert and die of
thirst."</p>

<p>Darkness by day is very different from the darkness of
night, for at night a man can take a bearing from the stars
and keep his direction.</p>

<p>It is difficult to give an adequate idea of the
conditions that prevailed. We were deafened, blinded and
suffocated.</p>

<p>To open one's mouth and gaspingly inhale sufficient
air to rid oneself of the terrible feeling of imminent
asphyxiation, was to fill one's lungs with sand; to open
one's eyes to see where one was going, was to be blinded
with sand; to stagger on, buffeted and bedevilled through
that black night-by-day, choking and drowning in a raging
ocean whose great breakers were waves of sand, was to
be overwhelmed and utterly lost; to give up hope and
effort and to lie prone, with face to earth, in the hope
of escaping the worst of the torture, was to be buried
alive.</p>

<p>Perhaps this was what Sergeant Frederic feared, for he
kept us moving&mdash;in single file, each man holding to
the end of the bayonet-scabbard of the man in front of him,
and with strict orders to give the alarm if the man behind
him lost touch.</p>

<p>Frederic put Badineff, Rien and myself last....</p>

<p>How long we struggled on, bent double against the wind,
I do not know, but I was very near the end of my tether,
and feeling as though I were drowning in a boiling sea,
when I was jerked to a standstill by the halting of the man
in front of me.</p>

<p>A Russian <i>légionnaire</i>, one Smolensky, appeared to
have gone mad, and with his clenched fists forced into his
eyes, and face upraised as though to lift his mouth above
the flying sand, screamed that he would go no further;
that Frederic was a murderer maliciously leading us to our
deaths, an incompetent fool who did not know in the least
where he was going nor what he was doing, and a scoundrel
who merited instant death....</p>

<p>A man threw himself on the ground.... Another....
Another....</p>

<p>As Rien, Badineff and I pushed forward, Sergeant
Frederic loomed up through the murk of this fantastic
Hell.</p>

<p>"What's this?" he yelled, leaning against the wind.</p>

<p>Another man threw himself on the ground, and the mad
Russian began loading his rifle, shrieking curses at
Frederic as he did so.</p>

<p>"Let's <i>die</i> like gentlemen, at least," cried Rien, as
Badineff sprang on the madman, wrenched his rifle from him
and knocked him down.</p>

<p>Another man, a friend of the madman, swung up his rifle
to club Badineff, and I seized it as it came back over the
man's shoulder.</p>

<p>Rien shouted something that was carried away by the
wind, and I received a heavy blow on the head.</p>

<p>I saw Sergeant Frederic draw his automatic, as I
stumbled and fell.</p>

<p>Like a prairie fire leaping from tuft to tuft, madness
was spreading from man to man, and the unauthorized halt
was becoming a free fight. The single-file column had
become a crowd&mdash;a maddened crowd ripe for revolt and
murder.</p>

<p>Sergeant Frederic acted with wisdom and his usual
coolness. As I staggered to my feet he roared the blessed
words:</p>

<p>"<i>Halte! Campez!</i>"</p>

<p>He was instantly obeyed, and everyone sank to the
ground. Going from man to man he pushed, pulled, shouted,
and exhorted, until he had got all but the weariest and
most despairing, crouched on knees and elbows, soles of the
feet to the wind, heads tucked in, chin upon chest, and the
face in the little space protected by the body.</p>

<p>In this posture, such as the Arab assumes in the lee
of his kneeling camel, when caught in a sandstorm, one
might hope to breathe, and by frequent movement to avoid
burial.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the patrol was almost obliterated
and, to any eye that could have beheld it when that awful
storm was at its height, it must have suggested an orderly
arrangement of sand-covered boulders, rather than a company
of men.</p>

<p>How long the sand-storm lasted I do not know, but it
was only by dint of frequent change of position that we
were not buried alive. Nor do I know how long it had been
day when the sun's rays again penetrated the dusty gloom.
Whether Sergeant Frederic really had the least idea as
to where he was, or where he was going, I do not know,
but he bravely strove to give the impression that all was
well&mdash;that we were not lost, and that a brief march
would bring us to water and to food. Encouraging, praising,
shaming, exhorting, promising, he got the <i>escouade</i> on its
feet and together, and after a brief brave speech, gave
the order to march, and as some of us turned to step off,
a Russian, Smernoff&mdash;a typical sample of "the brittle
intellectuals who crack beneath the strain," a loathsome
creature, mean as a jackal, and bloodthirsty as a wolf,
suddenly yelled:</p>

<p>"<i>March?</i> My God, yes, and where to?... You have lost
us; you have killed us, you swine!..."</p>

<p>And as Sergeant Frederic strode toward him, the beast
threw up his rifle and shot him through the chest.
Evidently he had slipped a cartridge in, during the
storm.</p>

<p>Frederic fell, rolled over, gasping and coughing blood,
drew his automatic, and, with what must have been a
tremendous concentration of will-power, shot Smernoff just
as Badineff swung up his rifle to club him.</p>

<p>"Hankinson," gasped Frederic as I sprang to his
assistance. "Take command.... Shoot any man who
disobeys you.... March straight into the wind&mdash;due
south...."</p>

<p>Hubbub arose behind me. A rifle was fired, and, looking
round, I saw that Dalgaroff had fired at Badineff and
apparently missed him, for Badineff sprang upon him and
bore him to the ground, his hands at his throat.</p>

<p>In a moment the <i>escouade</i> was in two fighting factions,
Smernoff's Russian gang against Badineff, Rien, myself, the
Roumanian and the Spaniards. I rose to my feet, and, as I
threw open the breech of my rifle, shouted words of command
which I hoped might be automatically obeyed. The result was
a clicking of breech-bolts as rifles were loaded.</p>

<p>"Rally here, the loyal men," I shouted. "Come on,
Badineff," and to my side sprang Rien, Jacob the Roumanian,
Badineff and the two Spaniards, and stood shoulder to
shoulder with me, between Frederic and the Smernoff
faction.</p>

<p>"Now, you fools," I bawled. "Aren't we in danger enough?
Follow me, and I will get you out of it.... I know the
way."</p>

<p>There was a groan and a movement behind us.</p>

<p>"Stand aside," said the brave Frederic, who had
struggled to a kneeling position, one hand pressed to his
chest, the other holding his automatic steadily.</p>

<p>"Mirsky," he croaked, "return to your duty. Fall in here
instantly."</p>

<p>Mirsky laughed, and Frederic shot him dead.</p>

<p>"Andrieff, return to your duty," continued Frederic.
"Fall in here instantly."</p>

<p>Andrieff flung his rifle forward and they both fired.
Frederic fell back. There was a thunder of hoofs, and a
troop of Spahis came down upon us at the charge&mdash;their
officer riding some fifty yards ahead.</p>

<p>"<i>Surrender!</i>" he roared, as he pulled his horse on to
its haunches. "<i>Ground arms.</i>"... And as his troop came
to a halt at the signal of his up-flung hand, he bade his
Troop-Sergeant arrest the lot of us. Leaping from his horse
he strode to where Frederic lay, bleeding to death, and
knelt beside him.</p>

<p>"Tell me, <i>mon enfant</i>," he said, and put his ear to
Frederic's feebly-moving lips.</p>

<p>"Mutiny," he whispered. "Not their fault....
<i>Cafard</i>.... No water.... Lost...."</p>

<p>And with a last effort raised his hand, and, pointing to
me, said:</p>

<p>"This man is ..." And died.</p>

<p>"Ho, this man is the ring-leader, I suppose," snapped
the officer, rising and glaring at me. "Tie his hands.
Tie the hands of the lot of them," and, drawing an
officer's field pocket-book from beneath his Spahi cloak,
he entered his observations&mdash;quite erroneous, as,
at the Court-martial, they proved to be. Having noted
that the dead sergeant had shot three of the mutineers in
self-defence after being twice wounded by them, and that
I was apparently the ring-leader, he made a list of the
names and <i>matricule</i> numbers of the prisoners, snapped
the elastic band upon his book, and returned it to his
breast-pocket with a certain grim satisfaction. He then
had the prisoners released and set them to work to dig two
graves, one for the Sergeant and one for his murderers,
while his troop off-saddled and took a mid-day rest....</p>

<p>That evening, we found ourselves strictly guarded and
segregated prisoners in the camp, and, after a brief
field Court-martial next day, at which our Spahi officer
testified that he had caught the lot of us murdering our
Sergeant, we were despatched to Oran for the General
Court-martial to decide our fate. Out of the mass of
perjury, false witness, contradictory statements and
simple truth&mdash;the latter told by Bien, Badineff,
Jacob the Gypsy, and myself&mdash;emerged the fact that
the <i>escouade</i> had murdered its Sergeant, losing three
of its number in the process.... Further it was decided
that if those three, as might be assumed, were the actual
murderers, the remainder were certainly accessories, even
if they did not include the actual slayers.</p>

<p>It was a near thing, and I believe that only one vote
stood between the death-sentence, and that of eight years'
penal servitude, <i>travaux forcés</i>, in the Disciplinary
Battalions of France.</p>

<p>The President of the Oran General Court-martial was a
Major de Beaujolais.... </p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="first">
It will perhaps be quite comprehensible that I do not
care to dwell over-much upon the time I spent in the Penal
Battalions of Madame la République.</p>

<p>I certainly am not going to complain of the treatment I
received, inasmuch as I was there by my own desire, and had
been at some considerable pains to arrive there.</p>

<p>Each country has its own penal system, and each country
can criticize that of the other, if it has nothing better
to do. Our own system is not without spot or blemish,
and one has heard unpleasant things of the treatment of
convict-workers in our coal-mines.</p>

<p>Charles Reade had considerable fault to find with the
English convict system, and those exiled to penal servitude
in Siberia have a poor opinion of Russian methods of
punishment.</p>

<p>And I am the less disposed to assail the French
convict-system because Biribi is now abolished (and
also, perhaps, the Devil's Island, where Captain Dreyfus
suffered, and the Guiana penal settlement), and the
worst punishments that we endured were inflicted upon
us illegally and in defiance of the law. These latter,
generally the outcome of the vicious spite of some
local petty tyrant, struck me as rather unnecessary,
for the prescribed and lawful punishments were wholly
adequate&mdash;apart from the fact that life itself was one
long punishment.</p>

<p>For example, I personally needed nothing more in the way
of correctional attentions than twenty-four hours of <i>la
planche</i>. This ingenious device was, as its name implies,
merely a plank. To the observer's eye, a simple plank, but
to the sentenced man it was something more.</p>

<p>In the first place, the plank was some twelve feet
above the ground. In the second place, it was neither
sufficiently long, nor sufficiently wide, to enable a man
to lie down upon it in anything but acute discomfort and
danger of falling. He could merely sit upon it&mdash;and he
could not do that for long, without changing his position
in the hope of finding one less racking and tormenting. In
the third place the heat and glare of that white-washed,
white-hot prison-yard was a cruel and dangerous torture in
itself.</p>

<p>The punishment of <i>la planche</i> sounds mild and
moderate. So did some of those of the Holy Inquisition of
old&mdash;particularly the worst of all, that of water
dripping on the head.</p>

<p>Let anyone who thinks it mild and moderate, try it for
an hour. Let him not try it for twenty-four hours, however,
lest he do not regain his sanity.</p>

<p>But could not one throw oneself off this hellish perch
of the devil? One could. One did. But not twice. He was
ready, willing, nay positively anxious, to return to that
now attractive plank, by the time he had discovered what
happened to those who voluntarily or involuntarily quitted
the post of dishonour.</p>

<p>Nor indeed was there any real necessity to exceed the
simple and lawful punishment of deprivation of water; of
standing facing the sun in a white-washed corner from
sunrise to sunset without food or drink; or of being
chained to a wall with the hands above the head.</p>

<p>In fact one would have thought that "hard
labour"&mdash;harder perhaps than that known to any other
convict in the world&mdash;by day, and lying chained to an
iron bar and to one's neighbour on the stone floor of a
shed, by night, might, with the absence of all that makes
life supportable, and the presence of everything calculated
to make life insupportable, have rendered even "lawful"
punishment unnecessary.</p>

<p>But no. Punishment beyond punishment had to be
inflicted, and then illegal and indefensible torture
added.</p>

<p>Chief of these were the <i>silo</i> and the <i>crapaudine</i>,
both once permitted by law, and both absolutely prohibited
and "abolished" by General de Negrier. I saw both these
tortures inflicted, and I suffered one of them myself.
But I wish to repeat, and to make it clear, that this
villainous brutality was wholly contrary to law and in flat
defiance of most definite military regulations.</p>

<p>Also, I wish to repeat that, in any case, I am not
complaining. What I got, I asked for.</p>

<p>Further, if the system was severe to the point of savage
and brutal cruelty, it is to be remembered that the bulk
of the convicts were desperate and dangerous criminals,
many of them barely human in their horrible depravity,
and far more dangerous to those in authority over them,
than any cageful of lions, tigers and panthers to the
wild-beast-tamer who ventures among them.</p>

<p>While there was a sprinkling of soldiers whose
horrible "crimes" were those of dirty buttons, slackness,
drunkenness, earning the enmity of an N.C.O., and being
generally and congenitally non-military, there was also a
certain number of ordinary criminals who had been, perhaps,
more unfortunate than wicked. But there was, as I have
said, undoubtedly a very large proportion of the worst and
beastliest criminals in the world, prominent among whom
was the typical Parisian <i>apache</i>, who has no faintest
shadow of any solitary virtue, save occasionally the savage
courage of the cornered rat.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>As is natural and very right and proper, the officers
and non-commissioned officers&mdash;and more particularly
the latter&mdash;are chosen with an eye to their
suitability for the work they have to do.</p>

<p>Stern disciplinarians are required and stern
disciplinarians are selected. Not only did the success of
the system depend upon the iron discipline of these men,
fierce, unbending, remorseless&mdash;but their own lives as
well. Many have been killed in the execution of their duty,
either by the sudden action of a maddened and despairing
individual, or as the result of a cunning plot, planned and
executed with fiendish ingenuity and ferocity.</p>

<p>They carry loaded revolvers in unfastened holsters,
and their hands are never far from them. In time, they
come inevitably to regard the convicts not only as
enemies of the State and of Society, but also as personal
enemies, and behave toward them accordingly. This is more
particularly true of the non-commissioned officers, and
in the conditions prevalent in far-distant desert places,
where the great French military roads are in course of
construction by convict labour.</p>

<p>And to one of these road-making gangs it was my fate
to be drafted&mdash;the fate "written on my forehead," as
the Arabs say&mdash;to which I had been destined, as I
believed, from the beginning of time, that I might fulfil
myself.</p>

<p>The latest road&mdash;a Road of Destiny indeed for
me&mdash;was to run from the city of Zaguig, of horrible
memory, to a place called the Great Oasis, a spot now
of the greatest strategic importance to France. On this
road were working a large proportion of the military
convicts.</p>

<p>So, once again, to Zaguig I came, and from Zaguig
marched out along the uncompleted high-way that was
miraculously to lead me to my goal. </p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p> Of that spell of road-work I remember but little.</p>

<p>Each day was exactly like its terrible predecessor. Each
night a blessed escape from Hell, if not to Heaven, at any
rate to a Nirvana of nothingness.</p>

<p>Often I wondered how men of education and refinement,
such as Badineff and Rien, delicately nurtured, were able
to bear the horror that was life, inasmuch as it was all
that I, with my great sustaining inspiration and need to
live, could do, to force my body to obey my will and keep
my will from willing death.</p>

<p>In point of fact, it was patent to me that Rien was
failing and that both the temper and the body of the giant
Badineff were wearing thin.</p>

<p>And then a spell of bad weather, with terrific heat and
sand-laden winds, that seemed to have been forced through
gigantic furnaces, precipitated, as so often happens, one
of those catastrophes of madness, mutiny, murder and heavy
retaliatory and repressive punishment.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that I was the innocent cause of this
particular example of these tragedies that are all too
common, and indeed inevitable, in such circumstances.</p>

<p>Small beginnings!...</p>

<p>As is so often the case, the beginnings of this affair
which was to cost the lives of so many men, were small
enough, God knows.</p>

<p>A Sergeant, one of those "hard cases" that are naturally
selected for their aggressive harshness, merciless
severity, and all the qualities that go to make the
ferocious disciplinarian and martinet, stood watching me as
I swung my pick; with blistered hands, aching arms, eyes
blinded with sweat, a terrible pain at the back of my neck,
and the feeling that if I bent my body once again, my back
would surely break....</p>

<p>As I painfully straightened myself, he stepped towards
me, and, with his stick, struck my cap from my head. To be
quite just, I think he was only making a sudden raid upon
that place of concealment, in search of tobacco, food,
paper, pencil, a piece of steel, or a sharp-edged stone.</p>

<p>However, the stick struck my head as well as my cap, and
I was still sufficiently near, in memory, to civilization,
to find his act discourteous. I must have given expression
to this wrong mental attitude, and looked upon him with the
eye of mild reproach.</p>

<p>Now, in the ranks of <i>les Joyeux</i>, looking can be an
offence. A cat may look at a king, but a convict may not
look at a corporal&mdash;save with the glance of the most
respectful, humble and obedient reverence. Any other kind
of look may be mutinous; a mutinous look may precede a
mutinous act; and a mutinous act precedes death. The red
blossoms of wrath must be nipped in the bud, and the
Sergeant promptly nipped mine.</p>

<p>In a second I was sent sprawling with a blow that partly
stunned and wholly confused me&mdash;and it was with a
sense of confusion worse confounded that I saw Badineff
raise his spade and fell the Sergeant from behind, while
Rien snatched the automatic that the man was in the act of
drawing.</p>

<p>Ludicrously enough, Rien shouted at the stunned
Sergeant, "You insolent dog! How dare you strike a
gentleman!" and was himself struck to the ground by a
convict, a Spaniard named Ramon Gonzales, a poor mean
soul who hoped to curry favour for his virtue, and gain
remission for his sins.</p>

<p>At the same moment, a Corporal dashed into the mêlée,
kicked me in the face, fired his automatic at Badineff,
and was promptly felled by a man belonging to another
<i>escouade</i>&mdash;and, even in that moment, I noticed the
splendid straight left with which he took the Corporal
on the point of the jaw, and the fact (which should have
astounded me) that he ejaculated in excellent English,
"Dam' swine!" as he did so.</p>

<p>As to exactly what happened then, I am not perfectly
clear, save that there was a rush of guards and convicts,
as Badineff picked up the automatic dropped by Rien, shot
the Spaniard who had felled the latter, shot the Sergeant
who rose to his feet and pluckily tackled him with his
stick, and then shot a guard who charged him with fixed
bayonet.</p>

<p>There was a terrific hubbub, some more indiscriminate
shooting, and within a few minutes of my original impious
glance at the Sergeant, a number of bodies was lying prone
upon the sand, whistles were blowing, voices barking
orders, convicts shouting insanely, and chaos reigning in
the very home of the world's most rigid discipline.</p>

<p>But not for long.</p>

<p>As always, discipline prevailed, and within another
minute or two, order was restored. All the bodies but
two or three, promptly came to life and were found to be
those of wise men who had flung themselves down until the
shooting was over, with the double view of dissociating
themselves from the evil doings of wicked men, and of
having a little nap.</p>

<p>Apart, very much under arrest, stood the villains of the
piece, myself, Badineff, Rien; the Roumanian gypsy known as
Jacob the Jew; the Spaniard, Ramon Gonzales; the man with
the useful left who had knocked the Corporal out, and three
or four more.</p>

<p>Well! We'd done it now, all-right! And it was a
drum-head Court-martial for ours that evening, and our
backs to a wall and our faces to a firing-party at dawn
next morning. Except that there wouldn't be any wall.</p>

<p>There would be a grave though, and we should dig it.
We should also stand by it and topple neatly into it when
the volley was fired. I hoped I should be dead before they
shovelled the sand in.</p>

<p>I also thought of a wily convict who was said to have
toppled before he was shot, and to have crawled out before
he was buried, and I pondered the possibility of contriving
these duplicities.</p>

<p>It did not come to this, however, and I am still in
doubt on the subject.</p>

<p>Chained together, and surrounded by guards with loaded
rifles and fixed bayonets, we were marched from the
scene of our sins&mdash;a long and miserable march, to
the temporary depôt of the slow-progressing, ever-moving
Company.</p>

<p>This depôt proved to be a deserted Arab village, and
for want of better or worse accommodation, we were hastily
consigned to its large underground grain-pit, or <i>silo</i>.</p>

<p>Confinement in these <i>silos</i> had been expressly
forbidden because men had gone mad in them, died in them,
been forgotten in them, had murdered each other in them
for the last drops of water. But many forbidden things
are done in those distant places where subordinates rule,
where public opinion is not, where the secrets of the
prison-house remain secrets, where the grave is very
silent, and where necessity not only knows no law, but is
apt to be the mother of diabolical invention.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Into this grain-pit we were dropped, one by one; those
who preferred to do so, being allowed to climb down a rope
by means of which a large pail of water and a sack of bread
were lowered for our sustenance until such time as a field
Court-martial could be assembled.</p>

<p>That might be upon the morrow, or, again, it might
not.</p>

<p>I do not think that there was any intention of actually
imprisoning us in this <i>silo</i> as a punishment&mdash;our
offence was too desperate for that.</p>

<p>I think that the officer commanding the Company&mdash;if
he knew anything about it at all&mdash;merely gave the
order to put us there as the simplest and easiest means
of keeping us secure for the brief space that remained to
us&mdash;probably only a day, or, at most, a couple of
days&mdash;before we were tried and shot for murderous
revolt against authority.</p>

<p>What then happened, above ground, we did not
know&mdash;and only two of us ever did know&mdash;but by
piecing together information which, as I shall tell, I
obtained later, I came to the conclusion that a whirlwind
attack by Touareg or Bedouin tribesmen, upon the Company,
drew every man from the depôt to the scene of the fight,
where they shared the fate of escort and convicts alike,
there being not a single survivor.</p>

<p>What happened below ground may be quickly told, for
the worst hours of my life, hours which seemed certain to
be my last, hours during which I was compelled to abandon
hope of helping Isobel, ended in the greatest moment of
my life, <i>the moment in which I found John Geste</i>, the
moment in which I knew that I had, against all probability,
succeeded.</p>

<p>During those dreadful days, we died, man by man,
according to our kind; some in fear, some in wrath; some
in despair, some in faith and hope; and one by his own
hand.</p>

<p>The two Anglo-Saxons survived, whether by tenacity,
strength, the will to live, or the Will of God; and on the
fifth day there remained alive only myself and the bearded
man who had struck and damned the Corporal&mdash;<i>and who
was John Geste</i>.</p>

<p>And then I should never have known him, but that he used
an expression that I heard nowhere else but at Brandon
Abbas.</p>

<p><i>Stout fella!</i></p>

<p>I really cannot, even now, give the faintest idea of
my feelings in that hour. As nothing I can say would be
adequate, I will say nothing.</p>

<p><i>I had found John Geste!</i></p>

<p>Think of it.... </p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="first">
Alive we were, but only just alive. Thirst, starvation,
suffocation, corpses, flies and other attendant horrors
had almost done their work on men not over-nourished, nor
in too good condition, at the start&mdash;and when we were
discovered it was none too soon.</p>

<p>We actually owed our salvation, I believe, to the
predatory, or at any rate, the acquisitive, instincts
of an aged party who, knowing of the existence of the
<i>silo</i>, came to see whether it contained anything worth
acquiring.</p>

<p>It did. And he acquired us.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>I was lying beside the inanimate body of John Geste, and
doing my utmost to persuade him not to die, when the light
from the small man-hole in the roof was obscured suddenly,
and I knew that we were either remembered or discovered.</p>

<p>I called out in French, and then in Arabic, seeing what
I thought to be the silhouette of the head of a native.</p>

<p>And, in the same tongue, a thin piping voice called in
wonder upon Allah, and then in question, upon us. I hastily
assured the owner of the silhouette and the voice, that he
was indeed the favoured of Allah in that he had discovered
us, powerful and wealthy <i>Roumis</i> who would, in return
for help, reward him with riches beyond the dreams of
avarice.</p>

<p>Apparently my feeble croakings reached not only the man
but his intelligence, for the head was withdrawn from the
top of the short shaft which connected the <i>silo</i> with
the ground above, and, a few minutes later, a rope came
dangling down into our dreadful prison.</p>

<p>I promptly decided that it would be better for me to
attempt the ascent first, for if I could get up I could
certainly get down again, and I wanted to see who and what
was up above, before fastening the rope to John Geste.</p>

<p>I did not like the idea, for example, of his being
hauled up to the roof and then dropped. I accordingly
passed the rope round my body beneath my arms, tied it on
my chest, and shouted to whomsoever was above, to pull.</p>

<p>For several minutes nothing happened&mdash;minutes
that seemed like hours, and then suddenly with a swift
but steady lift, I rose the fifteen or twenty feet to the
opening.</p>

<p>I thrust, fending, with my hands and knees, and was
ignominiously dragged out into the blessed light and sweet
air of day, at the heels of a camel to whose saddle-tree
the end of the rope&mdash;the identical rope with which we
had been lowered&mdash;was fastened.</p>

<p>The man leading the camel halted. I untied the rope, and
perceived myself to be in the company of three extremely
decrepit-looking old men, and three remarkably fine
riding-camels.</p>

<p>It was soon quite evident to me that the leader, at any
rate, of this aged trio was anything but decrepit mentally,
and he quickly grasped the idea that I was to be lowered
again into the pit, that I might bring up another man who
was alive but too weak to help himself.</p>

<p>Not only did he grasp my idea, but produced a better
one of his own&mdash;and I had only just understood it
and ejaculated, "God bless you, Grandpa," when my knees
gave way, my head spun round, and with infinite regret and
annoyance, I collapsed completely.</p>

<p>When I again opened my eyes upon the glorious and
wonderful world from which I had been absent for five days
in Hell, I was lying in the shade of a mud wall, and John
Geste was lying beside me.</p>

<p>Grandpa warmly welcomed my return to consciousness,
and explained that he and his young brother had been down
quick into the pit, while his youngest brother&mdash;a
lad who looked about eighty to me&mdash;had operated the
camel. Also that he had only brought up this one, albeit
a doubtful case, as the others were all dead, very dead
indeed.</p>

<p>I commended Grandpa most warmly, and promised to set
him up for life, whether in a store, a saloon, or a
houri-stocked Garden of Eden, and to see both his young
brothers well launched in life.</p>

<p>Not only had the excellent old man had the sense to
bring up our own pail, and fill it with water, but he had
concocted a millet-porridge abomination, which, with some
filthy and man-handled milk curd, formed the noblest and
most welcome feast which had ever been set before me.</p>

<p>More, and what gave me infinite joy on John Geste's
account, he had sent one of the boys for the milk.</p>

<p>While I was wondering where the dairy might be, Grandpa
mentioned that there was a Bedouin encampment "just over
there", and any amount of fresh camel's-milk was to be
had for the asking, and still more for the giving of a
cartridge or two.</p>

<p>When I began to question the ancient as to who he was
and whence he came, the light of intelligence faded from
his eye, all expression from the mask-like mass of wrinkles
which was his face, and he announced he was a very poor
man&mdash;a <i>miskeen</i> of the lowest type, and that I was
his father and his mother.</p>

<p>What he did tell us, and what was of the very deepest
interest, was that, five days ago, there had been a sudden
Touareg raid upon the road-gangs, a brief fight and a
relentless slaughter. Apparently this had taken place a
few miles from the deserted village where we lay, and the
Touareg <i>harka</i> had swept through it, slaying every living
soul they encountered.</p>

<p>As Grandpapa pointed out, it was lucky for us that they
had not chanced upon the <i>silo</i>. Modestly he contrasted our
present fortunate position with the fate that might have
been ours.</p>

<p>Excellent as were the ministrations, however, of these
three wise men of Gotham, or elsewhere, I doubt whether
either John Geste or I would have recovered in their hands.
We might have done, for we were both pretty tough and
imbued with the most intense yearning to live; but John,
I learned, had recently been most desperately ill, and
needed something more than curds and soaked millet-seed.
That he lived at all, was due, in the first place, to the
fact that we had a plentiful supply of fresh camel's-milk,
and, in the second place, that we were promptly captured
by semi-nomadic Bedouin, and, in a sense, fattened for the
killing. </p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p> On the second day after our rescue from the <i>silo</i>, as
John Geste and I lay in a deserted mud-hut, a tall Arab,
followed by our deliverer&mdash;volubly explaining that he
had just found us&mdash;stooped into the hut and favoured
us with a long, hard, searching stare, slightly amused,
slightly sardonic and wholly unfriendly.</p>

<p>And the Arab was Selim ben Yussuf, that handsome human
hawk.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the high-bridged aristocratic
nose, the keen flashing eyes beneath the perfectly arched
eyebrows, the thin cruel lips between the canonically
clipped moustache and the small double tuft of beard.</p>

<p>In the extremely dirty, dishevelled, unshorn and
emaciated creature before him, Selim utterly failed to
recognize the "wealthy tourist" whom jealousy had nearly
prompted him to stab in the garden of Abu Sheikh Ahmed at
Bouzen.</p>

<p>What he did see in me and John Geste, was a pair of
French convicts, delivered into his hand&mdash;an extremely
welcome capture, valuable whether for purposes of ransom,
hostage, torture, or mere humiliating slavery.</p>

<p>"<i>Salaam aleikoum, Sheikh</i>," I croaked. "I claim your
hospitality for myself and my comrade.... And listen.... He
is a great man in his own country, and his father would pay
a ransom of a thousand camels, for he is a very wealthy man
and loves his son...."</p>

<p>But ere I could embroider the theme further, Selim ben
Yussuf laughed unpleasantly, and with a contemptuous:</p>

<p>"Filthy convict dogs!" turned to our ancient rescuer and
bade him deliver us alive at the <i>douar</i>, whence he had
been obtaining the milk for us.</p>

<p>With profound obeisances and assurances of the promptest
and most willing obedience, the ancient backed from the
hut, vanished into thin air and was seen no more.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>When, a little later, a band of ruffians came to fetch
us, my strength and temper were both sorely tried. For when
I tried to carry John Geste to the miserable baggage-camel
provided for our transport, I was tripped up, kicked,
struck, reviled and spat upon, by these well-armed braves;
bitter haters, every one, of the Infidel, the <i>Roumi</i>, the
invader of the sacred soil of Islam.</p>

<p>Luckily we were not bound, and I was able to hold John
more or less comfortably on the camel. What I feared was
that his illness was typhoid fever, and that rough movement
would cause perforation and death. Luckily again, it was
only a short ride to the encampment of the semi-nomadic
tribe of which Selim ben Yussuf's father was the ruling
Sheikh.</p>

<p>From what I saw and heard of the old man, I got the
impression that he was a gentleman&mdash;a real courteous,
chivalrous, Arab gentleman of the old school, a desert
knight of the type of which one often reads, and which one
rarely meets.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, like so many Oriental fathers, he was so
besottedly devoted to his son that he could see no wrong in
him, and would deny him nothing. Further, although the aged
Sheikh had by no means abdicated, the reins were slipping
from his feeble hand, and were daily more firmly grasped in
the strong clutch of his son.</p>

<p>Selim, though not yet ruler, was the power behind the
throne&mdash;but there was another and a stronger power
behind him.</p>

<p>It was before these three, as they sat at the door of
a big white and brown striped tent, that we were driven,
I staggering along with the unconscious John&mdash;who
otherwise would have been dragged along the ground by one
foot&mdash;on our arrival at the <i>douar</i>. And, in a moment,
it was manifest that the old Sheikh spoke the final word,
that the young Sheikh's thought was expressed by that word,
while the third person's brain inspired the thought.</p>

<p>And the third person was the Angel of Death.</p>

<p>There, between the father and son, evidently beloved
of both, sat the indescribably beautiful half-caste of
Bouzen, the daughter of the Ouled-Naïl dancing-girl and the
Englishman who had loved her and left her.</p>

<p>She knew me instantly, even as our glances met, and
I was apprised of the fact by her long cool stare, and
mocking smile, though she spoke no word and gave no sign of
recognition.</p>

<p>Remembering the effect produced upon Selim by her
previous recognition of my personal attractions, I welcomed
her present reticence.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>And now what?... Here was a bewildering and astonishing
turn of affairs!</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>I had fallen into the hands of a bitter enemy of France,
who was also a bitter and jealous enemy of myself. Behind
him, and swaying him as a reed is swayed by the wind, was a
girl notorious for her destructive evil-doing&mdash;a girl
who loathed Christians in general, for her hated father's
sake, and me in particular for my lack of response to her
overtures at the house of Abu Sheikh Ahmed.</p>

<p>If she had been ready to kill me then, when I was a
person of some importance, and actually in the company of
the all-powerful Colonel Levasseur, what would she do to
me now that I was completely in her power&mdash;helpless
and harmless&mdash;a miserable piece of desert flotsam, an
escaped convict, whose killing the authorities would be
more disposed to approve than to punish!</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>I addressed myself to the old Sheikh, throwing
myself upon his mercy and appealing to his chivalry and
honour&mdash;in the name of Allah and the Koranic Law and
his own desert custom&mdash;for at least the three days'
hospitality due to the "guest of Allah," the traveller who
is in need.</p>

<p>"Traveller!" sneered Selim. "Convict, you mean....
A pariah dog that is condemned even by its fellow
dogs...."</p>

<p>Evidently the gentle Selim knew our brown canvas uniform
for what it was.</p>

<p>But the old gentleman rebuked him.</p>

<p>"Peace, my son," he gently chided, "the prayers of the
unfortunate are acceptable to Allah, the Merciful, the
Compassionate, for they are His children.... And he who
is merciful to the children of Allah is pleasing in the
sight of Allah, before Whom all True Believers must one
day stand.... Let these two men be guests of the tribe for
three days, and let them want for nothing.... Thereafter
let them go in peace, praising God...."</p>

<p>"So be it, my father," smiled Selim. And so it would be,
I decided&mdash;but I doubted that we should go far "in
peace."</p>

<p>"And if they be the condemned prisoners of the
<i>Roumis</i>," he continued, "are they not then the enemies of
the <i>Roumis</i>? And are not the enemies of the <i>Roumis</i> thy
friends?"</p>

<p>"No dog of an Infidel is my friend," growled Selim,
eyeing us savagely, and I felt truly glad that the old
Sheikh was still master in his own house.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>For the next three days we were regarded as honoured
guests, and had we been the Sheikh's own sons, we could not
have been, more kindly and generously treated.</p>

<p>Our food was of the best, we were given complete and
clean outfits of Arab clothing, and we shared a tent
plentifully provided with rugs and cushions. We were
favoured with the services of the Sheikh's own <i>hakim</i>,
a learned doctor who did us no harm&mdash;as I did not
give him the opportunity&mdash;and who did us much good
by decreeing that we be immersed in hot water and then
be clipped and shorn by the Sheikh's own barber. It was
fairly easy to get the good doctor to prescribe this and
whatsoever else I wanted him to prescribe, by pretending
to assume that he <i>would</i> prescribe it. And I had only to
say:</p>

<p>"I am sure that my sick friend will benefit <i>enormously</i>
by hot broth of goats' flesh, provided you will add to
it your learned and pious incantations ..." to procure
abundance of both.</p>

<p>That three days of perfect rest, with unlimited
fresh milk, broth, cheese, curds, <i>cous-cous</i>, bread,
sweet-meats, butter, eggs, lemons, and occasional
vegetables, did marvels for both of us, and led me to the
blessed conclusion that John Geste was not, after all,
suffering from malignant disease so much as from general
debility and weakness.</p>

<p>I had only been just in time.</p>

<p>But&mdash;Merciful, Gracious, Benignant God&mdash;I
<i>had</i> found him.... I <i>had</i> found him.... <i>I had found John
Geste and I had saved Isobel.</i></p>

<p>And I was curiously content and unafraid&mdash;strangely
happy and unanxious, in spite of our position, our almost
hopeless position between the upper French and the nether
Arab mill-stones&mdash;for I knew, I <i>knew</i>, I had not been
allowed to go so far that I might go no farther.... I had
not found John Geste to lose him again&mdash;by the hand of
man or the hand of Death.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Curiously enough, John Geste and I talked but little
during this time.</p>

<p>For the first couple of days he was so weak that I
discouraged conversation; and when, by the third day,
he had turned the corner, and, thanks to his splendid
constitution and great natural strength of mind and
body, he was making a swift recovery, conversation was
difficult.</p>

<p>There was so much to say that we could not say it, and
our talk consisted quite largely of those foolish but
inevitable repetitions of expressions of incredulity and
wonder.</p>

<p>I think it was some time before he really grasped what
had happened, and realized who I was; and when he did, he
could only lie and gaze at me in bewildered amazement.</p>

<p>And when I had slowly and carefully told him my
story from the moment when I had met Isobel at Dr.
Hanley-Blythe's nursing-home, to the moment when he felled
the Corporal who kicked me in the face, he could only take
my hand and endeavour to press it.</p>

<p>As became good Anglo-Saxons, we were ashamed to express
our feelings, and were, for the most part, gruffly
inarticulate where these were concerned.</p>

<p>Obviously John was worried at his inability to thank me,
and, every now and then, he would break our understanding
silence with a slow:</p>

<p>"Do you really mean that you actually enlisted in
the Legion in order to get sent to the Zephyrs on the
off-chance of finding <i>me</i>?... What can one say?... How can
I begin to try to express...? Isobel shouldn't have let you
do that...."</p>

<p>"Isobel had no say in the matter," I replied....
"Entirely my own affair.... Gave me something to do in
life...."</p>

<p>"It's incredible ..." said John.</p>

<p>"Yes.... A wonderful bit of luck.... No, not
luck...."</p>

<p>"I mean it's incredible that there should be a man like
you, who ..."</p>

<p>"Well, you yourself came back to Africa to look for a
friend," I reminded him.</p>

<p>"Yes ... but he had a claim on me.... I owed him my
life...."</p>

<p>"Well ..." I fumbled, "a claim.... If you're going to
speak of <i>claims</i> ..." and I stopped.</p>

<p>"God! How Isobel must have <i>loved</i> you&mdash;to let you
come," I said.</p>

<p>And:</p>

<p>"God! How you must <i>love</i> Isobel&mdash;to have come,"
said John Geste, and from the great hollow eyes the very
soul of this true brother of Beau Geste probed into
mine.</p>

<p>I looked away in pain and confusion.</p>

<p>His hot and shaking hand seized my wrist.</p>

<p>"Vanbrugh," he said, "you have done for Isobel what few
men have ever done for any woman in this world&mdash;will
you now do something for me?"</p>

<p>"I will, John Geste," said I, and looked into his face.
"What is it?"</p>

<p>"It is this.... Will you answer me a question with the
most absolute, perfect and complete truth&mdash;the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth&mdash;without
one faintest shadow of prevarication or limitation."</p>

<p>"I will, John Geste," said I.</p>

<p>"Tell me then," he begged, "does Isobel love you?"</p>

<p>Let those who can, be they psychologists, physiologists,
psychotherapists, physicians, lovers, or plain men
and women whose souls have plumbed the depths of
emotion&mdash;let them, I say, explain why, in that moment
I was stricken dumb.</p>

<p>I could not speak.</p>

<p>I could see the lovely face of a girl bending down to
me from the back of a horse ... I could see the boy, who
but those few years ago was myself ... I saw her smile
... I heard her voice ... I felt again the marvellous and
mighty uprushing of my soul to the zenith of such joy as is
known to human kind, when the declaration of my love had
trembled on my lips&mdash;and now, <i>I could not speak</i>.
I was stricken dumb&mdash;dumb as I was stricken on that
morning of my highest hope and happiness, that morning of
my deepest despair and pain.</p>

<p>John coughed slightly.</p>

<p>I fought for words.... For a word.... I wrestled as
with Death itself for the power to shout, "<i>No! No! No! A
thousand times, no!</i>" And I was dumb&mdash;sitting smitten,
aghast, horrified, staring into the tortured eyes of poor
John Geste.</p>

<p>His pale pinched face turned impossibly paler and yet
more pinched, and from the white lips in that frozen mask
came hollowly the words that seared me so.</p>

<p>"Then what I ask of you, Vanbrugh, is this. Get you
back safely to England. For the love of God, take care of
yourself and get back quickly.... And with this message....
That I died in Africa&mdash;for die I shall&mdash;and that
the very last words I said were ... that my one wish was
that you and she would be happier together than ever man
and woman had been before."</p>

<p>And then I found my voice, a poor and ineffectual thing,
hampered by a great lump in my throat, and after a cracked
and miserable laugh, I contrived to say:</p>

<p>"Why now ... that's certainly the funniest thing you
would hear in a lifetime.... Isobel love <i>me</i>!... Why she
loves any pair of your old boots that you left at home,
better than she loves the whole of the human race, myself
included ..." and I contrived another laugh. "Why, my dear
chap, Isobel would rather be on the ground floor of Hell
with you, than on the roof-garden of the Seventh Heaven
with the greatest and finest man that ever lived, much less
with <i>me</i>...."</p>

<p>His eyes still burned into mine.</p>

<p>"You're speaking the truth, Vanbrugh?... Yes ... you
<i>are</i> speaking the truth.... Isobel could only love
once.... How could I doubt her...."</p>

<p>"You're a very sick man," said I.</p>

<p>"I must be," he said, and coughed slightly, again. "But
oh, Vanbrugh, you ... you ... you ... <i>stout fella!</i>...
hero.... What can I say to you but that I understand,
Vanbrugh ... I understand ..." and being at the highest
pitch of emotion, his English hatred of showing what he
felt, came to his rescue, and with an embarrassed grin upon
his ravaged face, he squeezed my arm.</p>

<p>"Stout fella! You're a stouter man than I am, Gunga
Din," he said, and fell back upon his mattress.</p>

<p>Yes, the Gestes could <i>accept</i> generously, as well as
give generously&mdash;which is a thing not all generous
people can do. </p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p> During the three days' hospitality and grace, we had
received no visits save those of the doctor, the barber,
and the servants who waited on us with food, clothing and
hot water; and though I had no doubt that our tent was
pretty strictly guarded, we had been treated as guests
rather than prisoners, in accordance with the order given
by the old Sheikh.</p>

<p>On the fourth evening there came a change.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Instead of servants bearing a brass tray laden with
excellent food, Selim himself, followed by some half-dozen
of his familiars&mdash;young, haughty, truculent Sons of
the Prophet&mdash;swaggered into our guest-tent.</p>

<p>The change which came over his face as he did so, would
have been ludicrous had it been less ominous.</p>

<p>Expecting to see two foul and filthy ruffians, shaggy,
unshorn&mdash;garbed in the tattered remnants of brown
canvas uniforms, he beheld two clean and shaven gentlemen
of leisure, clad much as he was himself.</p>

<p>And then he recognized me.</p>

<p>"<i>Allah Kerim!</i>" he ejaculated. "Our blue-eyed tourist
of Bouzen! The contemptuous, haughty <i>Nazarani</i> dog, who
had not the good breeding to accept the kiss with which
the Angel of Death would have honoured him!... She shall
be the Angel of Death for you indeed, this time.... A
kiss?... You shall kiss a glowing coal.... An embrace?...
You shall embrace a burning brazier.... Perhaps that will
put some warmth into your cold heart, you dog.... And who
is this other escaped convict, masquerading in that dress
like a jackal in a lion's skin?... Have you slept warm, you
<i>Roumi</i> curs?... You shall sleep warm to-night&mdash;on a
bed of red-hot stones...."</p>

<p>And he gave an order that I could not hear, to one of
his followers. John Geste yawned.</p>

<p>"Chatty lad," he said. "What's biting him?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't like you much and he doesn't like me a
little," I replied, "and I am a bit worried. I don't know
exactly how far what he says goes, in this outfit.... He's
the lad I was telling you about&mdash;the lover of the lady
who was sitting in papa's pocket."</p>

<p>"And the lady?" asked John Geste. "I dimly remember that
there was one."</p>

<p>I stole a glance at Selim. His back was turned&mdash;he
had gone to the door of the tent and was looking out,
seemingly in reflection.</p>

<p>"I am not sure that she isn't the <i>deus ex
machina</i>&mdash;or shall we say the little 'dear' <i>ex
machina</i>," I replied.</p>

<p>"Or <i>cherchez la femme</i>, since we're talking learnéd,"
smiled John. "You think she may be our fate, eh? Beware of
a dark woman, what?... You know her?"</p>

<p>"I have met her twice, and I am not looking forward to
the third time," I replied.</p>

<p>"What sort of a person is she?"</p>

<p>"Well, the gentleman at the front door has been calling
us dogs quite freely&mdash;shall we say something of a
lady-dog?"</p>

<p>"What poor old Digby used to call a bitchelor," grinned
John. "Poor dear old Dig ... God! I wish he and Beau were
with us now...."</p>

<p>"Amen," said I, and was moved to add, "I'll bet they're
watching, mighty interested," and, at that moment, Selim's
order bore fruit in the shape of some husky negroes.</p>

<p>"Get up, you dogs," he snarled.</p>

<p>"Why certainly, most noble and courteous Arab," said
John Geste, as he rose painfully to his feet. "I have eaten
of your salt, and I thank you."</p>

<p>"You have eaten of my father's salt and you may thank
him&mdash;that three days have been added to your miserable
life," was the uncompromising reply.</p>

<p>"The arm of the French is very long, Selim ben Yussuf,"
I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, convict," he replied, "it will reach you, I think,
or rather your body.... The terms of the reward are 'dead
or alive' I believe."</p>

<p>"Selim ben Yussuf!" mused John, aloud. "Son of a famed
and noble Sheikh, and seller of dead men's flesh!... Does
he eat it too?" he added, turning to me.</p>

<p>"Why no," I said. "He's far too good a merchant ... he
can get money for it.... He sells those who eat his salt
too...."</p>

<p>It was a dangerous line, but it <i>was</i> a line&mdash;on
Selim's pride and self-respect. Torture me he might, but
I did not think he would sell me alive or dead, much less
John Geste, against whom he had no grudge save that of his
nationality and religion.</p>

<p>My last remark had certainly got him on the raw, for he
strode up to me, his hand upon the big curved knife stuck
in the front of his sash.</p>

<p>"Lying Christian dog, you have <i>not</i> eaten of my salt,"
he shouted. "It was my father's.... 'Three days,' he said
... and he is no longer in the camp."</p>

<p>"A great gentleman," I observed. "The old order changes
..." and I shrugged my shoulders.</p>

<p>I had an idea that the old Sheikh had not gone very
far, nor for very long&mdash;or our shrift would have been
shorter.</p>

<p>"Throw the dogs out," he snarled, turning to his slaves,
and we were unceremoniously hustled from the tent, and
with sundry kicks, blows and prods with spear-butt and
<i>matrack</i>-sticks, we were personally conducted to some low
mean goat-skin tents, situated at a distance from the main
camp and much too near an enclosure obviously tenanted by
goats.</p>

<p>Into one of the tents we were thrown, and for the
moment, left&mdash;but around a camp-fire that burned in
front of it, certain unmusical loud fellows of the baser
sort rendered night hideous and escape impossible.</p>

<p>A glance round the filthy and dilapidated tent showed
it to be entirely unfurnished, nor was anything added
unto us save a huge and disgusting negro, who entered and
made himself one with us, who were evidently his sacred
charge.</p>

<p>John Geste, courteous ever, gave him welcome.</p>

<p>"Take a chair, Archibald, and make yourself at home,"
said he. "Take three, if you can...."</p>

<p>Archibald, or rather Koko, as we later discovered his
name to be, made no reply.</p>

<p>He merely sat him down and stared unwinkingly and
unwaveringly.</p>

<p>If he had been told to watch us, he certainly did it.
And after his eyes had bored into us like gimlets for a few
hours, we were constrained, with many apologies, to turn
our backs on him.</p>

<p>For more hours we sat and talked of plans of escape, and
could only conclude that, in our weak state, our one hope
was the good-will of the old Sheikh.</p>

<p>Nor was this hope a strong one, for however kindly the
old man might treat us while we were in his power, it was
too much to hope that he would do anything but hand us
back, safe and sound, to the French authorities.</p>

<p>Any Bedouin tribe grazing its flocks in the
neighbourhood of the Zaguig-Great Oasis Road, would act
wisely in giving every possible proof of its innocence,
virtue and correct attitude towards the French, in view of
the recent attack upon the road-gangs. </p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="first">
That night I was taken horribly ill; so ill that, after
thinking it must be cholera, thought departed altogether,
and I knew nothing more for several days.</p>

<p>When I did return to a realization of my surroundings,
I found that I was back in the guest-tent, and that I was
alone.</p>

<p>Where was John Geste?</p>

<p>My last memory was of his helping me in that foul
goat-skin hole, while that beastly nigger, callous as an
animal, sat and stared.</p>

<p>A horrible panic fear gripped my heart, and feebly I
called John's name. And even as my heart almost stopped,
I was reassured by the thought, the conviction, the
certainty, that this wonderful thing, this finding of John
Geste, against all probability, was no chance, no piece of
luck&mdash;much less a colossal mockery. We are <i>not</i> the
sport of mocking Fates.</p>

<p>But I called his name again, with what little strength I
had.</p>

<p>Quite possibly the old Sheikh had returned, and, finding
that we had been evilly entreated, had had us brought back,
not only to the guest-tent, but had given us a tent each.
The better sort of Arab is capable of much fineness in the
matter of hospitality&mdash;a hospitality enjoined by his
religion and by countless centuries of desert custom, the
outcome of desert need.</p>

<p>At my second feeble call, a man stepped into the tent,
in the shade of which he had probably been sleeping. He was
one of the servants who had previously waited on us in this
same tent.</p>

<p>"Where is my brother?" said I.</p>

<p>"Gone, <i>Sidi</i>," replied the man, and promptly departed,
returning in a few minutes, accompanied by the <i>hakim</i>.</p>

<p>From this gentleman's delight in finding me conscious,
I gathered that he had been strictly charged to effect my
recovery, the credit for which he promptly awarded himself.
To this he was very welcome, as was, to me, the broth
which he prescribed&mdash;together with pills, potions and
Koranic extracts. These last he painfully wrote on scraps
of rag wherewith he enriched the mutton broth.</p>

<p>The pills I pushed into the sand beneath my rug. With
the potions I watered their burial-place. The rags, in my
gratitude and generosity, I bestowed upon the deserving
waiter, by way of a tip. For the broth I found a good home,
and felt the better for it.</p>

<p>But when, after thanking and congratulating the eminent
physician I asked:</p>

<p>"And where is my brother, <i>Sidi Hakim</i>?" I got the same
unsatisfactory reply.</p>

<p>"<i>Gone!</i>" and a gesture of the thin hands and delicate
fingers, to indicate a complete evanishment as of smoke
into thin air.</p>

<p>In spite of my continued reassurement of myself, I was
anxious, worried, frightened, and filled with a horrible
and apprehensive sense of impotence.</p>

<p>However, there was nothing to be done, save to recover
strength as quickly as might be possible.</p>

<p>"Now let me think&mdash;clearly and calmly," said
I&mdash;and promptly fell asleep.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>When I awoke, the Angel of Death was sitting beside
me, chin on hand, and regarding me with a look which was
anything but inimical.</p>

<p>Staring, startled from my sleep, I read her thoughts.</p>

<p>I am quite certain that at that moment, all that was
European in her was uppermost. She was her father's
daughter, civilized, white, kind.</p>

<p>She smiled, and while the smile was on her face she was
utterly and truly beautiful, more beautiful than any woman
I have ever seen, save one.</p>

<p>Extending a gentle&mdash;and very beautifully
manicured&mdash;hand, she wiped my brow with a small and
scented handkerchief, product of Paris.</p>

<p>"Ze poor boy," she said softly. "But he has been so ver'
ver' ill," and kissed me in the manner and the spirit in
which a mother kisses a sick child.</p>

<p>"Thank you&mdash;er&mdash;Mam'zelle," I said. "Where is
my friend?"</p>

<p>"<i>Gone</i>," she replied.</p>

<p>For the third time I had received that sinister reply to
my question.</p>

<p>"Gone&mdash;<i>pouff</i>! Like zat," she continued, and
this time the gesture was that of one who blows away a
feather.</p>

<p>"I play a trick on Selim, wiz him.... Zat Selim think
himself too clever.... <i>Oui</i> ... <i>Sacré Dieu.</i> ..."</p>

<p>"What trick? Tell me quickly.... Where is he?" I
begged.</p>

<p>"Zat Selim?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, no, no! My friend, my brother! Quick! Where is
he?"</p>

<p>She laughed mischievously, obviously quite pleased with
herself.</p>

<p>"<i>Oh, la, la!</i> He does not matter.... He serve his
purpose.... He serve my purpose too.... Oh! zat great fool,
Selim!... But now you go sleep again...."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, but tell me first, where is my friend? What
have you done with him?" I begged.</p>

<p>"What is he to you?" she asked, and her pleased smile
faded a trifle.</p>

<p>"My friend! My brother!" I replied.</p>

<p>Her expression changed. A look of doubt succeeded the
smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, well!..." she shrugged, as she rose to her feet,
"... he is only a man!... But <i>I</i> am a <i>woman</i>!..."</p>

<p>And her smile, as she left the tent, was not in the
least motherly. </p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p> My state of mind may be imagined.</p>

<p>Against all probability, against possibility almost,
I had found John Geste, had thanked God for that
miracle&mdash;and John Geste had vanished.... The cup
dashed from my lips. The fruit of my sufferings and
labour&mdash;dust and ashes.</p>

<p>I groaned in spirit, and I was near despair. But,
if I can be understood, I lost hope without losing
faith&mdash;and did the one thing I could do. I strove to
regain my physical strength, while I walked delicately in
the path of friendship with the Angel.</p>

<p>That evening she visited me again, all smiles and honey,
honey that grew a little over-sweet and cloying.</p>

<p>I learned that Selim ben Yussuf was away, with most of
the fighting-men of the tribe, and that the old Sheikh
was at Zaguig, presumably by pressing request of the
Authorities, who would probably be making life a little
difficult for every tribal leader within a hundred
miles.</p>

<p>On this and other topics of local interest, she chatted
freely, and seemed quite willing to tell me truthfully
everything but the one fact I wanted to know.</p>

<p>The moment I spoke of John Geste she became evasive,
laughed mischievously, and as I pressed for an answer,
seemed first embarrassed and then impatient and annoyed.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>After she left the tent, I thought I would see what
happened if I attempted to leave it too.</p>

<p>Koko happened.</p>

<p>He made it quite clear to me, though without violence or
even truculence of manner, that the guest-tent was my home
and that from home I should not stray. As I returned and
dejectedly dropped upon my mattress, the <i>hakim</i> entered
and I had a bright idea.</p>

<p>I asked him whether he had any personal interest in my
recovery.</p>

<p>He replied that my life was dearer to him than that
of his oldest son. I said that that was very nice, but
ventured to point out that one would scarcely have thought
it, when I lay practically dying, down by the goat-farm.</p>

<p>Ah, that was quite a different matter. Selim ben Yussuf
had left no doubt, in reasonable minds, that the news of
my early demise would be received with equanimity. Hence
something in my <i>cous-cous</i>, which had nearly done the
trick.</p>

<p>But the news of my approaching demise had not been
received by the Sitt Jebrail, the Angel of Death, with any
equanimity at all.</p>

<p>On the contrary.</p>

<p>She had left no possibility of doubt in any reasonable
mind that my death would only precede that of the good
<i>hakim</i> by a very few minutes&mdash;and hence the fact that
my life was dearer to him than that of his oldest son, and
that I, being possessed of the feelings of a gentleman
would undoubtedly consider the feelings of another
gentleman, and live for all I was worth.</p>

<p>This was most excellent, and I returned to my original
point.</p>

<p>"So you <i>do</i> want me to live, <i>Sidi Hakim</i>?"</p>

<p>"I desire nothing more fervently, <i>Sidi Roumi</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, I can and shall live, on one condition, and on
one only.... That I am at once told what has become of my
brother, and that I am thereafter at once restored to his
society.... Get that right plumb in the centre of your
intelligent and most noble mind, <i>Sidi Hakim</i>."</p>

<p>The good doctor's face fell.</p>

<p>"<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>" he murmured in astonishment. "I have
heard of these things.... People pining for each other....
Men for women.... Women for men.... Even the lower
animals.... But a man for a man!... Is it possible?..."</p>

<p>"It is here under your nose, <i>Sidi Hakim</i>," I said
earnestly. "I'm going to die right here, to your great
inconvenience, I fear.... Where is my brother?"</p>

<p>"He is gone, <i>Sidi</i> ... but do not grieve.... He is
alive and well&mdash;in the best of health, and full of
happiness.... And he is being <i>well</i> looked after ... Oh
yes.... On my head and my life.... And on my son's head and
on my son's life.... I swear he is being most carefully
looked after.... Yes.... By the Ninety and Nine Names of
Allah.... By the Beard of the Prophet...."</p>

<p>I shut my eyes and fetched a fearful groan.</p>

<p>"Tell me everything quickly, for I am on the point of
Death," I whispered as deathfully as I could contrive.</p>

<p>"<i>Sidi! Sidi!</i>" he wailed, "I dare not say a word....
She would have my feet set in the fire...."</p>

<p>"All-right.... Good-bye," I replied, and, like King
Hezekiah, I turned my face unto the wall, continuing this
death-bedlamite comedy, in the hope of getting some scrap
of information from this gibbering pantaloon.</p>

<p>"<i>Stop! Stop! Sidi</i>," squeaked my medical attendant.
"Will you swear not to betray me to her, if I tell you what
I know ... I know nothing really."</p>

<p>"I will not betray you, <i>Sidi Hakim</i>," I said. "And I
will not die if you tell me the truth."</p>

<p>"Your brother has gone back
to&mdash;er&mdash;his&mdash;er&mdash;friends," announced
the <i>hakim</i>, diffidently.</p>

<p>His information certainly brought me back to life,
all-right. I shot up in bed and seized him, almost by the
beard.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that the <i>French</i> have got him
again?" I shouted.</p>

<p>"Yes ... Yes ..." admitted the <i>hakim</i>. "He is perfectly
safe now...."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>I fell back upon my pillows feeling like dying in good
earnest. "He was perfectly safe now!..."</p>

<p><i>John Geste was back in the hands of the French and all
my work was to do again....</i> </p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="first">
I don't think I gave way to despair. Although my
heart sank into the very depths, there was, as it were, a
life-line to the surface&mdash;a line of faith and hope.
I had found John Geste once.... What man has done once,
man can do again. Evidently this girl knew something, and
apparently had some hand in whatever had happened; and
almost certainly Selim ben Yussuf had played a part. I
imagined myself with my hands at Selim's throat, squeezing
and squeezing until either the eyes came out of his head,
or the truth out of his mouth.</p>

<p>What had the girl said?</p>

<p>"I played a trick on Selim with him"&mdash;and I
half-wished it was recognized good form, and quite
permissible if not praiseworthy, to serve her as, in
imagination, I had just served Selim.</p>

<p>What I must find out was whether the <i>hakim</i> had spoken
the truth&mdash;which was quite problematical&mdash;and,
if so, whether John had been taken to Bouzen, Zaguig, or
one of the construction-camps on the Road. Of course it was
quite possible that he was even now within a few yards of
me&mdash;either above ground or below it.</p>

<p>What in the name of God could be the trick that she had
played on Selim ben Yussuf <i>with John</i>.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Followed by a fine-looking Arab, whom later I knew to be
Abd'allah ibn Moussa, she again entered the tent.</p>

<p>"Tie his feet firmly, but without hurting him, and his
hands in such a way that he is not uncomfortable," she
ordered. "He will get strong very quickly now, and I don't
want him to run away."</p>

<p>"Will you kindly tell me what has become of my brother,
Mademoiselle?" I asked politely. "There can be no harm in
my knowing, can there, especially now that you have tied me
up so securely?"</p>

<p>"<i>Eh bien</i>, how he chatter about zis friend of his! I
tell you he has <i>gone</i>&mdash;gone where you nevaire see him
any more.... But you see <i>me</i>, isn't it?... Don't I look
nicer than that friend of yours, <i>hein</i>?"</p>

<p>"You'd look a lot nicer than you do, if you
told me everything, Mademoiselle," I replied. "You
are a European&mdash;you are a woman&mdash;we are
Europeans&mdash;we have done you no harm. Why behave like
one of these uncivilized Arabs?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ah, oui</i>, zat's so," agreed the Death Angel. "You are
both Europeans. I wish all Europeans have only one heart,
and I can stab it. I wish all Europeans have only one
throat, and I can cut it."</p>

<p>She looked like a tiger-cat, and while I watched, her
face changed utterly, and, with a sweet and gentle smile,
she dropped to her knees and leant over me.</p>

<p>"All Europeans except you, I mean, Blue-Eyes. You are
nice and good and <i>gentil</i>. <i>You</i> would nevaire <i>desert
anybody</i>, isn't it? <i>Nevaire would you do that</i>, I know in
my heart." And she kissed me on the lips.</p>

<p>"You kiss me," she said. "You kiss me quick, and say
you nevaire run away, and I untie your hands and feet, and
take your <i>parole</i>, isn't it? Kiss me, <i>kiss me</i>, I tell
you."</p>

<p>I closed my eyes, set my lips firmly&mdash;and received
a stinging blow on the face. </p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p> What shall I say about this astounding woman, known
as "The Angel" among the Arabs, and as "The Angel of
Death" to those Europeans who had the privilege of her
acquaintance.</p>

<p>She was the most extraordinary and remarkable human
being whom I have ever met, yet at the same time there was
really no reason that she should astonish and astound, for
she was the perfectly logical outcome of her heredity and
her environment.</p>

<p>What should the daughter of a hundred generations of
savage courtesans&mdash;unscrupulous, avaricious and
unbridled&mdash;sometimes be, but an evil unscrupulous
savage? What should the daughter of a blue-eyed Nordic
sometimes be, but balanced, self-respecting and amenable to
ideas of civilization.</p>

<p>We are assured that in every Jekyll there is some Hyde,
and in every Hyde there is some Jekyll; and the best and
the worst of us are well aware that the materials of which
our characters are woven are not of even quality. But with
this "Angel," it was not only a case of a mixed nature
reflecting mixed descent, but a case of a complete and
undisputed occupation of her body at different times, by
two utterly distinct and different personalities.</p>

<p>For part of the time&mdash;for the greater part of
the time&mdash;she was just herself, the Anglo-African,
the half-caste, with all the expected attributes of
the mulatto. But for the rest, she was either "The
Death-Angel," the savage, the African, the lawless and evil
native courtesan; or else Mlle. Blanchfleur, the European,
the normal white woman, calculable, and, within her sphere,
conventional....</p>

<p>Be that as it may, she most certainly astonished and
astounded me&mdash;this most pathetic, most terrible,
nightmare woman.... Nightmare indeed&mdash;for, thinking
of her frequently, as I do&mdash;I often dream of her,
and though these dreams are not nightmares in the sense
that dreams about my father are, their warp is horror and
their woof is pity; and the dream is sad, melancholy and
depressing beyond belief.</p>

<p>If I could but put the Angel from my mind!...</p>

<p>I cannot and I never shall.... I think of her, to this
day, as frequently as I think of Isobel herself, and
infinitely more unhappily. (That is a foolish thing to
say, for there is nothing whatsoever of unhappiness in
my thoughts of Isobel. What did Isobel ever bring to any
living soul but happiness?)</p>

<p>Some of the truth of what I have said of the Angel of
Death can be grasped by realizing that her actions ranged
from the decreeing and superintending of torture, to the
performance of acts of trusting and noble generosity; from
venal bestiality, to a high idealism; from a bitter savage
vengefulness, to a noble and generous forgiveness.</p>

<p>In short from the worst of her Arab mother to the best
of her Christian father. </p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p> Whenever Koko, the negroid slave, whose precious
charge I was, took his yellow-whited eyes from me, yawned,
scratched himself, and stared vacantly out into the
wonderful desert night, I gnawed at the palm-fibre cords
which bound my wrists. Should I succeed in freeing my
hands, it was my unamiable intention to free my feet, and
then to do my utmost to incapacitate this gentleman.</p>

<p>He had a long sharp knife, and a heavy stick, short and
thick. I had a hard and useful fist. With one of these
three weapons something might be done. I did not at all
like the knife idea. My own fancy ran in the direction of
a swift and knock-out presentation of the fist, followed
by a more leisured confirmatory application of the heavy
stick. This seemed to me a reasonable compromise between
the slaughter of a citizen, who after all was but doing
his duty, and my continuation in a position of extreme
peril.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"<i>Eh bien! On dîne donc, n'est-ce pas?</i>" murmured a
silky voice, as I sat with down-bent head, my teeth fixed
in the unpleasant-tasting hairy cord.</p>

<p>"'Ow you like it, <i>hein</i>?... Eat a bit more then,
M'sieur Blue-eyes. P'raps that the las' food you get,
what?"</p>

<p>"<i>Bon soir, Mademoiselle</i>," I replied, with an attempt
at a debonair smile and an air of gay bonhomie that I was
very far from feeling. "Won't you join me?... Have a bite
..." and I raised my bound wrists toward her.</p>

<p>"Ah, so you say, is it, Blue-eye ... Yellow-hair....
Laughing face ..." replied the Angel, and kneeling beside
me, seized my wrists and deliberately bit my hand with the
ferocity and strength of a wild beast.</p>

<p>"Laike what you call savage dog, <i>hein</i>?" she said,
thrusting her face against mine.</p>

<p>"Or a dog of a savage," I observed.</p>

<p>"<i>Sacré Dieu!</i> How I <i>hate</i> you ... <i>hate</i> you ...
<i>hate</i> you!" she cursed, and, even as I was thinking,
"Better than loving me, anyhow," she seized my head and
crushed her lips violently against mine....</p>

<p>"<i>Baisez-moi!... Baisez-moi!... Baisez-moi!...</i>" she
cried.</p>

<p>"Soh! You will not kees me, noh?... Naow, leetle
Blue-eyes, you kees me, or see what come," and she took me
by the throat.</p>

<p>I was revived from the faintness of strangulation by the
pain of her setting her sharp teeth in my lip.</p>

<p>... Darkness, and a roaring in my ears....</p>

<p>... A voice speaking from very far away.... Had I been
clubbed on the head.... What was that?... Oh yes, the
gentle Angel.</p>

<p>"Oah, yon <i>won't</i> kees me, <i>hein</i>? You won't lov' me,
<i>hein</i>? You won't 'ave me any price, noa? S'pose I say you
never kees any other girl, <i>hein</i>?" she panted. "S'pose I
cut your lips off, yes?" and she seized my ears and shook
my head violently to and fro....</p>

<p>Most painful, undignified and humiliating.</p>

<p>"Uh! You say nothing on that, is it? You don't grin
some more, <i>hein</i>?... What s'pose I say you never <i>look</i>
any other girl?... What s'pose I have those blue eyes for
myself.... 'Ave them out your silly 'ead, yes?..." and
as she spoke, she thrust her thumbs violently and most
painfully beneath my eyes. I suffered most horribly in
the next few minutes, but I can truthfully say that the
idea of surrender to this tempestuous petticoat absolutely
never entered my head. I don't know why, but the idea
simply never occurred to me. Nor do I think that the reason
for this lay in any Joseph-like virtue inherent in my
character, nor in any definite feeling that when I did fall
from grace, it would not be with the Angel of Death as a
companion.</p>

<p>I think my resistance was simply and solely due to the
fact that I am one of those stubborn creatures whom you can
lead on a hair, but cannot drag with a cable. Also I have
Red Indian blood, and my "No" means "<i>No</i>."</p>

<p>Every fibre of my being rebelled against this coercion,
and the Angel was beating her head not only upon mine
but against a stone wall&mdash;compounded of the dogged,
unyielding rock of Anglo-Saxon stubbornness, and the cement
of Red Indian stoicism, tenacious and prideful.</p>

<p>Not unto me, but unto mine ancestors the credit, if
I bore well the sufferings and the temptation&mdash;the
temptation to escape torture&mdash;that were put upon
me....</p>

<p>But always I had to remember that a dead, maimed, or
blinded Otis Vanbrugh would be of but little service to
John Geste ... to Isobel....</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Springing to her feet, the Angel of Death (by means of a
violent kick upon his latter end, tactfully turned towards
us) attracted the attention of our chaperon, who squatted
in the doorway of the tent, pondering perchance, Infinity,
Life and the Vast Forever&mdash;or indeed, his latter
end.</p>

<p>With a nasty oath and a stream of guttural orders, in
Arabic, she drove him from the tent.</p>

<p>During his absence, the Angel gave me what she termed
my last chance, and made it clear to me, beyond the
peradventure of a doubt, the terms upon which I might
retain my right to life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness.</p>

<p>By the time I had made it equally clear to the Angel
that, since I was not a person to be led along the
primrose paths of pleasant dalliance, still less was I
one to be scourged adown their alluring ways, the good
Koko had returned and entered with seven devils worse than
himself.</p>

<p>By the Angel's clear and explicit direction, I was
roughly jerked to my feet, dragged from the tent, and
thrown down at the root of the nearest tree.</p>

<p>With promptitude and dispatch, a young palm was cut
through, some six feet from the ground.</p>

<p>Impalement! Surely not? It could not be possible that
this girl, who had European blood in her veins, who had
consorted with Europeans, who knew something of Christian
teaching, and who was, after all, a woman&mdash;was
going to have me stripped and stuck upon the sharpened
end of this tapering stump, to die miserably ... to die
a lingering death of unspeakable agony, while a crowd
watched, jeered and gloated.</p>

<p>A woman!... But Hell hath no fury like a woman
scorned.... If Hell had a fury such as this Angel at that
moment, the Devil himself must have felt unsafe....</p>

<p>No, they were not sharpening the top of the stump.</p>

<p>I was again jerked to my feet, held in position and
tightly bound to it.</p>

<p>It was to be a stake and not a spear.</p>

<p>Surely she was not going to have me burnt alive....
Burnt before her eyes....</p>

<p>A woman!... But a woman scorned....</p>

<p>What should I do as the flames mounted, and death was
imminent.... Plead to the woman?... Agree?...</p>

<p>Dead, I could not serve Isobel.... A hard choice....</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>No. I saw no preparation for a fire.</p>

<p>Their immediate task completed, the black soldiers stood
about&mdash;incurious, stupid, animal. The Angel gave them
a curt order and they went, with scarce a further glance at
me&mdash;and I and that she-devil were alone. </p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p> "Now, my friend," she said when we were alone, "we
just see 'ow long you defy ze Angel of Death!... <i>Sans
doute</i> you t'ink yourself ver' fine man and bear pain like
Aissa dervish, <i>hein</i>? But I tell you somesing.... Don't
you leave it too late, so that when you say '<i>All-right,
Mademoiselle; I finish&mdash;I give in&mdash;I do what you
laike</i>,' you are not already too spoilt, see?... No good
saying zat after you gone blind for always, or after your
tongue cut out for always, or you are too burnt ever to
walk about any more, see?"</p>

<p>I saw.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Blue-Eyes," this well-named young woman
continued, "you rather be deaf and dumb both, or blind
only&mdash;if I be kind and give you choice?... Perhaps
you anger me, and you get all three!... Perhaps I get
ver' angry and you 'ave no 'ands and no feets.... <i>Oh,
la, la</i>, zis poor lil' Blue-Eyes!... He ver' proud man
until one day he got no eyes, no tongue, no ears, no
hands, no feet.... Oh, ver' proud man&mdash;ver' 'andsome
man&mdash;till someone cut off his lips and his nose
and his eye-lids&mdash;not so pretty then.... What you
t'ink?"</p>

<p>I remembered John Geste's cold iron courage, and yawned.
The Death Angel was certainly taken aback.</p>

<p>It then occurred to me to use my lips, while I had them,
to whistle a little air. And the first that came to my mind
was the one I had sung, or howled, to the Zouave Sergeant
as I lay under the wall in Zaguig.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>," whispered the girl. "Is it you are ze
bravest man ever I have met&mdash;<i>or is it perhaps you
t'ink I am making ze bluff and will not torture you?</i>"</p>

<p>A little bit of both, I thought. I am playing at being
a brave man&mdash;and surely no human girl could cut a
man's eyes out, stab his ear-drums, hammer a wedge into
his mouth and cut his tongue out.... Not even an "Angel of
Death."...</p>

<p>"Because if it is <i>zat</i>, I soon show you," continued
this she-devil. And drawing her knife she ripped my
<i>jubba</i> and <i>kaftan</i> downward from the throat, exposing my
chest.</p>

<p>"Kees me," she said softly, rising on her toes, and
placing her lips on mine.</p>

<p>"<i>No?</i>" ...</p>

<p>And on the right side of my chest she made a horizontal
gash.</p>

<p>I started and quivered with the sudden pain, and was
thankful that she had not, as I had expected, driven the
knife into my throat or heart.</p>

<p>She stepped back a pace.</p>

<p>"'Ow you like <i>zat</i>&mdash;for start?" she asked, and,
again placing her lips on mine, whispered "Kees me."</p>

<p>"<i>No?</i>"</p>

<p>And again she slashed my breast with a horizontal gash
an inch below the other.</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i> kees me," she said, and put her lips to mine.</p>

<p>"<i>No?</i>"</p>

<p>And with a sloping cut she joined the ends of the two
gashes with a third.</p>

<p>"See?" she asked. "Ze letter Z!... I write my name on
you&mdash;ZAZA.... Always you remember Zaza then.... For ze
little time you live, I mean.... Twelve cuts, it is. I do
it ver' neatly now."</p>

<p>Evidently a case of practice making perfect, I
thought.</p>

<p>"You kees me now, <i>hein</i>?"</p>

<p>I tried to think coolly. If I let this fiend kill, or
utterly incapacitate me, there was the end of my search
for John Geste&mdash;the end of my service to Isobel. I
must give way, for their sakes. But, I told myself, were
John Geste safe in England, this young woman should not
defeat me. Pride is a poor thing to be proud of, and so
is stubbornness, but I freely confess to being proud of
both.</p>

<p>Well, the dozen cuts would not put me out of action, so
she could carry on.... But if it really came to blinding,
she would win&mdash;and, as she felt my unresponsive lips,
she changed from cold anger to red-hot rage&mdash;which was
probably my salvation.</p>

<p>"<i>Kees me! Kees me! Kees me!</i>" she screamed, hammering
my face and body with her clenched fists.</p>

<p>"You <i>won't, hein</i>?... Then I'll waste no more time!...
Now you kees me and say you love me&mdash;or you die ...
and you die <i>slow</i>&mdash;and blind," and she pressed the
point of her knife sharply in under my right eye.</p>

<p>I saw the grim face of the Sioux Chief, my ancestor, but
even to be worthy of him, I must not hold out longer. She
was going to blind me&mdash;and no blind man could help
John and Isobel.</p>

<p>I gave in.</p>

<p>"<i>Zaza</i>," I began&mdash;and the word was drowned
in a scream, as the girl flung down the knife, threw
her arms about my neck, and kissed me passionately and
repeatedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, forgive, forgive!" she cried. "I was mad.... A
devil comes into me and I must be cruel&mdash;cruellest
to what I love best. Forgive me, dear Blue-Eyes, and
see&mdash;promise me you will come back to me, and I will
let you go after your friend&mdash;I will do anything
for you if you will promise to come back to me.... I
cannot live any more without you.... Look&mdash;I will do
<i>any</i>sing&mdash;<i>every</i>sing if you promise to come back,"
and, with a slight return of her former manner:</p>

<p>"And I swear to God, on this piece of the True
Cross"&mdash;and she touched her book-shaped
locket&mdash;"and to Allah, by this Hair of the Beard of
the Prophet, and by my mother's soul, that, if you do not
promise, I will stab you to the heart, and then stab myself
to the heart also, and we will die together here."</p>

<p>"I promise," I said, only too thankfully&mdash;"that
I will come back to you as soon as I have seen my friend
leave Africa in safety&mdash;if you will tell me the truth
and give me every help you can."</p>

<p>"Yes, and suppose zat is not in many years&mdash;in ten
years and twenty years, when I am ugly old woman?</p>

<p>"I give you one year," she added. "You come back to me
in one year, or directly you save your friend," and picking
up her knife she placed its point above my heart, and I
knew with perfect certainty that, if I refused, I should
die.</p>

<p>"I will return to you in a year," I said, "or before, if
I have found my friend within that time, provided you tell
me the truth, and help me in every way."</p>

<p>"And you will marry me?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Of course," I replied.</p>

<p>"And you will take me from this vile country where I am
a wicked woman, and neither Arab nor European?"</p>

<p>"I will," I said, "but get this clear&mdash;the sooner
my friend is found and saved, and sent out of Africa, the
sooner will you get what you want.... Now tell me.... What
was this trick you played on Selim ben Yussuf?"</p>

<p>As she cut at the cords that bound me, she told me how
Selim ben Yussuf, in jealous rage, had decided to torture
me to death, as soon as his father went safely away to
Zaguig.</p>

<p>At that moment, a French patrol, a <i>peloton méhariste</i>,
had ridden into the camp, and Zaza had pointed out to
Selim ben Yussuf that a far finer vengeance than mere
death by torture, would be to hand me back to the ghastly
slavery from which I had escaped!... Moreover, he would
be killing two birds with one stone, for, by giving up an
escaped convict, he would be doing a good deal to sweeten
the somewhat unsavoury reputation that he bore with the
French.</p>

<p>Selim ben Yussuf had agreed that the idea was a splendid
one, and had given orders for the <i>Roumi</i> prisoner, in
the white burnous, to be brought and handed over to the
<i>goumiers</i> of the patrol.</p>

<p>Anticipating this, she had instructed Abd'allah ibn
Moussa to take away John's blue burnous and give him my
white one....</p>

<p>So the <i>hakim</i> had told the truth!...</p>

<p>After chafing my limbs, and lavishing upon me the
loving tender care and kindnesses of a mother or a wife,
Zaza helped me back to my tent&mdash;did everything for my
comfort, and suggested that, since our bargain was made, I
should now relax my foolish and insulting behaviour, and
show myself as fond and loving toward her as she was more
than willing to be toward me.</p>

<p>The position was a delicate one.</p>

<p>The last thing in the world, that I wanted to do, was to
offend her, to bring back her spirit of savagery, to make
her anything but my most earnest helper. And the last thing
but one, that I wanted to do, was to make love to her.</p>

<p>"Zaza," I said. "Listen. We've made a bargain. Are you
going to keep your side of it?"</p>

<p>"Most pairfectly," she replied, "but, oh, most
truly."</p>

<p>"And so am I," I said. "When I come back I will be
your husband. I will be kind, and gentle, and everything
you want me to be to you, but now it is business, work,
planning and thinking&mdash;not love-making. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>"I onderstand," said Zaza. "You <i>will</i> come back
to me. Yes, yes, I trust you.... I <i>know</i> you will
come back&mdash;my dear.... <i>You</i> would never desert a
woman...." </p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="first">
I suppose that it is a perfectly vain imagining
when I wonder whether the Angel's last fiendish
outbreak&mdash;that so nearly cost me my sight, if not my
life&mdash;<i>was</i> her last. It would give me very great
peace of mind to think that the mood that followed, the
mood of remorse and utter repentance, could be thenceforth
her normal condition, and that her vehemently expressed
hatred of savagery, violence and vice, would last.</p>

<p>Vain imaginings and foolish hopes, I fear. For a
temperament is a temperament and she was as much the
daughter of her Arab mother as she was of her Christian
father.</p>

<p>But the girl that sat the night through, beside my
couch, was lovable, gentle, a civilized white woman and
rather the ministering angel, "when pain and anguish wring
the brow," than the sinister Death Angel of so short a
time before. She was, moreover, pathetic and pitiful, and
it touched my heart to hear her aspirations to that way of
life, way of thought, and way of conduct, that befitted the
daughter of her father.</p>

<p>"We will never come near this accursed country ever
again, my dear one, when you are my 'usban'.... We will go
to Paris, and Wien, and Londres, an' I will be so good an'
r-r-respectable.... An' everyone will call me Madame and
Missis, an' not silly evil names like Angel of Death....
An' we will have a fine 'ouse an' everysing <i>comme il
faut</i>.... An' all my clo'es shall be make in Paris.... An'
we will go to the Opera.... An' we will ride in ze Bois....
An' I will not be Moslem at all, but all Christian.... An'
scorn all zem <i>demi-mondaine</i> like 'ell....</p>

<p>"You <i>will</i> come back to me.... You will start to come
back to me ze day your frien' go on board his ship?... Or
else you give up ze search for 'im, an' start back to me,
one year from zis day, <i>hein</i>?... You <i>promise</i>?...</p>

<p>"Yes ... Yes ... I know you speak truth.... I know
men.... I know ze true voice an' ze false voice.... Ze true
eyes from ze false eyes.... From us of ze Ouled-Naïl no man
can hide behind his face.... No, no.... I am <i>not</i> of ze
Ouled-Naïl.... <i>À bas les Ouled-Naïls....</i> I am English....
I am daughter of Omar ze Englishman.... Yes ... Yes ... I
know you speak truth.... Your blue eyes are true eyes....
Your kind voice is true voice.... I <i>know</i> you will come
back to me....</p>

<p>"Look, dear one,... will you not swear it for me on
Bible and Koran both? Swear it before your God and my
Allah.... Will you not swear it on zis leetle gold book
I wear roun' my neck.... Nevaire I take it off ... it
is a great talisman an' great amulet.... One side is my
Father and a piece of True Cross.... That is God side....
On other side is my Mother an' one hair of ze Beard of ze
Prophet.... Zat is Allah side ... Ze Sultan himself gave
it to her mother.... No harm can come to me while I have
such a thing as zis, can it?... I would put it roun' your
neck, dear one, an' give it to you, but I dare not let it
go from me.... All would be good for you, an' that I would
laike.... But it might not be bringing you back to me....
If I keep it, all will be good for <i>me</i>, an' then it will
be bringing <i>you</i> back to me.... But when you come back to
me, you shall have it an' wear it always, night an' day,
an' then no harm can ever come to you.... I will show you
ze pictures of my Father an' my Mother to-morrow....</p>

<p>"Always I am afraid to open it at night-time, lest
I lose ze piece of ze True Cross which is only a tiny
splinter; or ze hair of ze Beard of ze Prophet.... Zat
would be too ter-r-rible.... I should die....</p>

<p>"Oh, it will be bringing <i>you</i> safe back to me.... Yes
... Even though I wear it you will be safe, because unless
it kept you safe and brought you back to me, it would not
be bringing good to me, an' making me happy, isn't it?...
Yes ... it will keep you safe for me.... An' your truth,
honour and goodness will make you come....</p>

<p>"Oh! an' I know.... Such fun.... Old Haroun el Rafiq
shall do a <i>sand-reading</i> and tell us.... Now I have
nevaire spoke your name an' you have nevaire seen him, so
he cannot know.... We shall see...."</p>

<p>Calling to Koko, she bade him fetch Haroun el Rafiq,
and, half an hour or so later, a strange hairless creature
of indeterminate age and with the deadest features and
the livest eyes I have ever beheld, followed Koko into
the tent, salaamed humbly to the Angel, fixed his burning
eyes on mine, and squatted cross-legged on the ground.
From a small sack he tipped out a pile of sand before
him, smoothed it flat with the palm of his hand, made a
geometrical pattern upon the surface with white pebbles,
and studied his handiwork with rapt attention.</p>

<p>After a minute or so of this contemplation, he wiped out
the pattern, smiled as to himself and at his own thoughts,
shook his head, rose to his feet and made to leave the
tent.</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop!" cried the Angel. "You've told us
nothing...."</p>

<p>"What does the Sitt desire to know?" inquired the
soothsayer.</p>

<p>"First of all, whether this Sidi will return?"</p>

<p>"Return where?" asked the man. "To this place?"</p>

<p>"Will return to me, I mean," said the girl frankly.</p>

<p>"He will," promptly replied the man, and the enigmatic
smile again disturbed the frozen calm of his dead features.
"I saw him riding at the head of a goodly company....
Riding from the north, straight to you.... I saw the
<i>kafilah</i> arrive amid scenes of joy and welcome.... I
saw him stride to your tent and I saw you rush forth and
embrace him as a lover.... I saw you feasting with him,
alone, in a bridal tent...."</p>

<p>The Angel sat with parted lips and shining eyes.</p>

<p>"Did you see more?... More ..." she urged.</p>

<p>"No," answered the man, and I knew he was lying. "It is
enough...."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is enough," murmured the Angel.</p>

<p>"More than enough," I thought.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>The sand-diviner's prophecy elated my companion as
unreasonably as it depressed me.</p>

<p>"Yes ... You will come back.... <i>C'est vrai.</i> ... I feel
it <i>here</i> ..." she said, laying her hand upon her heart.</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall come back, as I have promised," I said,
"if I live.... But the more immediate question is when
shall I <i>start</i>?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear one ... my dear one ... my love....
<i>Must</i> you leave me at all?... Why must you go?... He is
only a convict ... a <i>scélerat</i>.... A what-you-call dam'
rascal...."</p>

<p>"He is an innocent man, and the finest man that ever
lived," I remarked, "and he is my friend. I only came to
this country to find him.... And through you I lost him....
The sooner I go to look for him, the sooner I shall be able
to return to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear one, my dear one, if I had only known!...
What a <i>fool</i>.... What a <i>devil</i>, I was.... Oh, cannot I
come wiz you?... Yes, <i>why</i> cannot I come wiz you?... It
is not zat I do not trust you, but I cannot bear zat you
should leave me...."</p>

<p>"You cannot come with me," I said. "In the first place,
Selim ben Yussuf would be on our track with half the tribe,
the moment he returned to find you gone.... In the second
place, you cannot live like a hunted wild beast, as I may
have to do. Besides, I may give myself up to the French
again, if I can get news of him in no other way."</p>

<p>And I pondered the fact that there would be no record
nor witness of the mutiny that had led to our incarceration
in the <i>silo</i>, if, as our deliverer had told us, the whole
unit had been surrounded and wiped out, to a man. John
Geste and I, if I returned, would merely be two of the
convicts who had somehow escaped the massacre.</p>

<p>"No, I cannot come wiz you," sighed the Angel. "I
should be 'indrance an' not ze 'elp, an', as you say,
Selim ben Yussuf would capture us and keel you....
But I can help you.... Yes, I can send you off wiz ze
best of everysing.... You shall have my own camels an'
men&mdash;when you mus' go...."</p>

<p>"You cannot go until you are stronger," she added.</p>

<p>"I must go before Selim ben Yussuf returns," I reminded
her.</p>

<p>"Yes ..." she agreed. "But you need not go far until you
are strong. You could go a day's ride and camp.... An' I
will tell Selim zat you, zat is to say <i>your frien'</i>, as he
thinks, died.... The <i>hakim</i> will swear it.... He fears me
greatly...."</p>

<p>"He certainly does," I agreed.</p>

<p>"Yes ... I have one or two spells ..." she smiled.
"Spells an' magics zat you buy in ze chemist's shop in
Algiers.... An' potions.... Ah, <i>oui</i>!... potions.... One
drop of which makes ze hard stone or ze steel, bubble an'
smoke.... An' I will send Abd'allah ibn Moussa wiz you....
My own faithful servant.... He is faithful as ze horse of
ze Arab, an' ze dog of ze Englishman.... He is as brave as
ze lion, an' as true as Life an' Death....</p>

<p>"He was ze devoted servant an' frien' of my Mother, an'
he nurse me when I am a baby.... An' now he lof me laike he
lof my Mother.... If I say to 'im, '<i>Go you, Abd'allah ibn
Moussa, wiz zis man. He is my lover ... die for him, or die
wiz him</i>,' he will not come back wizzout you, an' I will
feel comfor'ble in my 'eart.... Nevaire, nevaire will he
leave you...."</p>

<p>I felt that such fidelity might prove embarrassing.</p>

<p>"He'll be a useful guide, anyhow," I agreed. "But I'll
send him back as soon as I am well on my way, and feeling
fairly strong."</p>

<p>"I shall tell him not to leave you," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Well, I may have to leave <i>him</i>," I replied.... "But
anyhow, the sooner you give him instructions to get your
camels and people together, the better."</p>

<p>I knew something of Arab dilatoriness and the utter
meaninglessness of time, in the desert.</p>

<p>Without further remark, she rose to her feet, drew her
veil about her face, and left the tent.</p>

<p>I followed her to the entrance, with some vague idea of
escape from the terrible silken meshes of the dreadful web
that this jewelled spider was spinning about me.</p>

<p>"Salaam, <i>Sidi</i>," grinned the unutterable Koko.</p>

<p>"Hell!" I replied, and again flung myself down upon my
cushions. </p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p> A few minutes later, the Angel returned, followed by an
Arab, whose fine and noble face was that of a man of middle
age, great intelligence, philosophic calm, high courage,
and great determination and tenacity.</p>

<p>I speak without exaggeration. The man's face was noble
and he proved to be a noble man, if fidelity, endurance,
unswerving loyalty and courage, connote nobility.</p>

<p>"Zis is Abd'allah ibn Moussa," said the Angel, and the
man salaamed respectfully. "Zis is a <i>Roumi</i> lord," she
continued, turning to Abd'allah.</p>

<p>"Also he is my Lord and my Master, and your Lord and
your Master.... He is my lover and he will raise me up to
be his wife.... Go with him, Abd'allah.... Follow where he
leads.... Sleep where he sleeps.... Live where he lives....
And die where he dies.... But he will not die, Abd'allah
... for you will guard his life with yours, and you will
bring him back to me...."</p>

<p>"On my head and on my life be it," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Go and make ready," said his mistress, and he went
away.</p>

<p>There was a commotion of hails, shouting, and men
running&mdash;alarums and excursions without, in fact.</p>

<p>Abd'allah ibn Moussa turned back into the tent.</p>

<p>"A <i>kafilah</i> comes," he said, and went about his
business.</p>

<p>The Angel's eyes met mine and her face paled.</p>

<p>"Zat Selim!" she said, as with a bitter laugh, I
ejaculated:</p>

<p>"Selim ben Yussuf!"</p>

<p>"I will keel heem, zat so-clever Selim," whispered the
Angel, and the European side of her character seemed to
fade somewhat.</p>

<p>"I must hide you.... I must hide you.... He must not
see your face.... See! You must go back to the goat-herds'
tents as soon as it is safe.... I will keep Selim in his
tents.... I will send Abd'allah to take you back.... I will
tell zis Selim zat ze frien' of ze blue-eye Nazarani is
dead, an' Abd'allah shall disguise you.... Yes, like a poor
blind <i>miskeen</i>...."</p>

<p>Well, things seemed to be going wrong indeed.</p>

<p>What would I not have given for a few hours of normal
health and strength.</p>

<p>I must leave it to the wit and the wiles of the Angel to
keep me hidden until I could get away.</p>

<p>The estimable Koko stooped into the tent, very full of
himself.</p>

<p>"His Highness, the Sidi Emir, the Sidi Sheikh el Hamel
el Kebir, Shadow of the Prophet, and Commander of the
Faithful, has arrived with his great Wazir, noble sheikhs,
captains, and many soldiers," he announced pompously.</p>

<p>"He calls for the high Sheikh Yussuf ben Amir, and for
Selim ben Yussuf his son, and for the Sheikh's captains and
<i>ekhwan</i> of the tribe."</p>

<p>The Angel's face relaxed and she heaved a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>"Ze good God be praised! It is not zat Selim!"</p>

<p>"But who is it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"<i>Oh, la, la!</i> He is ze gr-r-reat big man! He is ze
chief of ze chiefs.... He mak' treaty wiz ze French....
He is ver' civilized an' important! He marry English
girl&mdash;laike me.... He is frien' to French an' treats
well all <i>Roumis</i>.... Oh, he is <i>ver'</i> big man.... An'
often, before, I have want to see him.... But now I have
you, dear one, I care not at all...."</p>

<p>A pity!</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>And now, what? How was this going to affect me and my
fortunes?</p>

<p>If this Emir were a staunch ally of the French and
"kind to all <i>Roumis</i>," presumably he would be kind to
me&mdash;until he handed me back to his allies.</p>

<p>How long would he stay here? What exactly was the extent
of his power over this tribe?</p>

<p>Would the <i>hakim</i>, or one of the servants, attempt to
curry favour with him by informing him that there was a
captive <i>Roumi</i> in the camp&mdash;or would they fear the
Angel more than they feared him?</p>

<p>An idea occurred to me.</p>

<p>If this Emir were truly great, as the Angel implied,
might he not be touched by a truthful "David and Jonathan"
story?</p>

<p>Suppose I told him everything, threw myself upon his
mercy, and begged him to help us.... Might he not accede,
and, moreover, be a very tower of strength, if his heart
were touched and his imagination fired? I would speak of
John Geste figuratively as my brother, and quote the Arab
proverb: </p>

<br>
<p class="quote">
"The love of a man for a woman, waxes and wanes as doth the moon:<br>
But the love of brother for brother is constant as the stars,<br> And endureth like the word of the Prophet." </p>
<br>

<p>And if I failed, and if he were inimical, or merely
disposed to do his duty to his allies, the French, should I
be in any worse position?</p>

<p>If he handed me over to the nearest "competent military
authority," I should be promptly sent to Zaguig, and thence
to the nearest road-gang, where, in all probability, John
Geste had already been sent.</p>

<p>That would be something, but now that I knew of his
whereabouts, I could probably help him better from without
than from within.</p>

<p>It was almost impossible&mdash;it was certainly too much
to hope&mdash;that another such series of events as had set
us free together, could ever happen again, even if he and I
were in the same <i>escouade</i>.</p>

<p>What to do?</p>

<p>As these thoughts passed through my mind, I watched the
face of the Angel, who also was pondering deeply, pinching
her lower lip the while....</p>

<p>"I sink I will go an' see zis Emir," she said at last.
"Perhaps I will make him do somesing, <i>hein</i>?"</p>

<p>Doubtless she had excellent reason for putting faith in
her powers of persuasion where Arabs were concerned. It was
wholly hateful, but I brought myself to say:</p>

<p>"You know best.... If this Emir can and will help
us...."</p>

<p>"<i>Enfin</i>: If he get your brother for you, <i>he get you
for me</i>, isn't it?... <i>Oui!</i> ... I mus' quickly see zis
Emir.... He will camp close by.... I will send Abd'allah
to say zat I will pay heem a leetle visit.... I sink he
has heard of me.... Oh, yes.... Zen he will make feast,
an' I will see which way ze cat jump.... If he get <i>ver'</i>
friendly, I will tell heem he must help you and your
brother.... Ze good God grant zat zat Selim does not return
before I get you away.... Ah, but if I mak' <i>great</i> frien's
wiz ze Emir, I could mak' him keep Selim in his camp as
hostage for ze good be'aviour of zis tribe.... I will
<i>tell</i> him sings about zat Selim....</p>

<p>"Now do not let anybody see your face until I come back,
dear one.... And you go to sleep and get strong while
I am gone.... I will send some more of ze beef-tea of
muttons...." </p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p> And sleep I did, long and heavily, possibly by reason
of some unusual ingredient in the beef-tea of mutton.</p>

<p>When I awoke, it was as a giant refreshed, and I
was filled with an unwonted sensation of hope and
confidence.</p>

<p>My first visitor was the <i>hakim</i>, followed by a servant
bearing hot stew in a jar, and most welcome coffee in a
brass bowl.</p>

<p>So much better was I feeling, that I wondered whether my
excellent medical attendant, having poisoned me at Selim's
request, had administered an antidote when ordered by the
Angel to save my life if he wished to save his own.</p>

<p>In point of fact, the creature did not strike me as
being of sufficient intelligence and medical knowledge to
deal with a cut finger or a blistered heel, but undoubtedly
some of these rascally quacks are familiar with poisons
unknown to the European pharmacopoeia.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I felt unexpectedly stronger and fitter and,
having finished the stew and enjoyed the coffee, I demanded
more.</p>

<p>Having fed, washed and been shaved, I peeped from
the door of the tent to see what was doing in the great
world.</p>

<p>The first object that met my interested gaze was the
indefatigable Koko, leaning against the stump of a tree,
just in front of the entrance to my tent, and gazing at
it&mdash;gazing and gazing.</p>

<p>I wondered whether the creature ever shut his eyes at
all. Certainly the Angel knew the secret of inspiring
obedience and fidelity in her servants.</p>

<p>About a quarter of a mile away, a couple of remarkably
fine tents, marquees almost&mdash;before which flags and
pennons fluttered from the hafts of spears stuck in the
ground&mdash;marked the temporary residence of the Emir.</p>

<p>Near to these big tents was the extremely orderly and
well-aligned camp of his followers or body-guard, a camp
much more like that of European troops than of a band of
Arab irregulars....</p>

<p>Once more I wondered what had taken place in those
pavilions&mdash;whether the Angel had visited the Emir,
and if so, with what success her power of intrigue,
allurement and diplomacy had been brought to bear upon the
incalculable mentality and character of this powerful lord
of the desert.</p>

<p>I was soon to know.</p>

<p>A little later, she entered my tent, threw back her
<i>haik</i>, and seated herself upon the cushions.</p>

<p>Obviously she had succeeded beyond her wildest hopes.</p>

<p>Seizing my hands in hers she laughed gleefully.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dearest dear one.... It goes well.... I am so
happy.... Ze Emir is <i>gentilhomme</i>.... Oh, he is gr-r-reat
man ... civilized and good and kind.... And oh, zat Wazir
of his.... <i>Oh, la, la!</i> Oh, he is one naughty little
man.... Oh, <i>mais c'est un grand amoureux</i>, zat one....
He mak' lof to me ... oh, laike 'ell. But listen.... What
you sink? Zis Emir, he know all about everysing.... He
know there is a <i>razzia</i> on the French.... He know zat
some of you are hiding down in a pit, an' all die excep'
two...."</p>

<p>"But how on earth does he know that?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don' know.... He know everysing zat happen in ze
desert.... Everysing.... They say ze vultures tell him....
He know two of you are in zis camp.... So when I find zat
he know everysing, I tell him ze truth.... Oh, he was ver'
angry wiz zat Selim.... I tell him old papa Yussuf ben Amir
go to Zaguig before ze French come to <i>him</i>.... An' I tell
him Selim give back one prisoner to ze French patrol....
An' now he want to see you.... Do not be afraid.... It is
good zat you go to his camp, then Selim cannot do anysing
at all.... An' ze Emir promise me he will not give you up
to ze French.... Now I tell papa Yussuf ben Amir, an' zat
Selim, an' everybody, zat you are <i>died</i>...." </p>

<h2><a id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="first">
Accompanied by Abd'allah ibn Moussa, Koko, the <i>hakim</i>,
and the Angel's servants who had waited upon me, and knew
me to be a <i>Roumi</i>, I set forth, my <i>haik</i> well across my
face, to visit the Emir el Hamel el Kebir, Chief of the
Confederation of Bedouin tribes that inhabited the desert
country which extended from Zaguig to the Senussi sphere
of influence, and had its capital or centre in the Great
Oasis.</p>

<p>His name, titles and position I had learned, as far as
possible, from the Angel; from Abd'allah ibn Moussa, who
appeared to have for him an admiration almost amounting
to veneration; and from the <i>hakim</i>, the tribal gossip,
scandal-monger, and news-agent.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Seated on a rug-strewn carpet in front of the largest
tent, were two richly dressed Arabs. They were alone, but
within hail was a small group of sheikhs, <i>ekhwan</i>, and
leaders of the soldiery.</p>

<p>Sentries, fine up-standing Soudanese, stood at their
posts, or walked their beat in a smart and soldier-like
manner.</p>

<p>I got an impression of discipline and efficiency not
usually to be found about an Arab encampment.</p>

<p>From the little group of officers and officials, a broad
squat figure detached itself and came to meet us&mdash;a
deformed but very sturdy dwarf, whom I knew later as
Marbruk ben Hassan, the Lame. He saluted me politely while
my following salaamed profoundly.</p>

<p>"His High Excellency the Sidi Emir bids you welcome and
gives you leave to approach," he said, and bidding the
others remain where they were, he led me to the carpet,
whereon sat the man who so mysteriously "knew all things"
that happened in the desert.</p>

<p>With a wave of his hand, the big man dismissed the
dwarf, and beckoned me to draw near.</p>

<p>The huge Emir, and his small companion, presumably
the "naughty Wazir," eyed me with a long and searching
stare.</p>

<p>I decided to stand upon what dignity I had, to hold my
peace, and let the Emir speak first.</p>

<p>He did.</p>

<p>"Mawnin', Oats," he said casually. "How's things?...
Meet my friend El Wazir el Habibka, known to the police and
other friends, as Buddy...."</p>

<p>What was this?... Sun, fever, lunacy, hallucination?...
Most annoying, anyhow.... How could one carry on, if one's
senses played one such tricks as this?... One expects to
be able to believe one's own eyes and ears. And yet here
were my eyes apparently beholding the face of my brother
Noel&mdash;bronzed, lined, wrinkled and bearded&mdash;and
my ears apparently hearing his voice. His absolutely
unaltered voice. With regard to the face I might have been
deceived; as to the voice, never&mdash;much less the two in
conjunction. Besides, the man had called me "Oats," Noel's
own special nickname for me since earliest childhood.</p>

<p>"Pleased to meet any friend of Hank's," said the smaller
man, his grey eyes smiling from an unsmiling face.</p>

<p>"He's my young brother," said the Emir.</p>

<p>"Oh?" observed the other slowly. "Still&mdash;that
ain't his fault, is it, Hank Sheikh? Why couldn't you say
nothing, an' give the man a fair chance?</p>

<p>"Don't you brood on it, friend," he added, waving his
hand, "and anyway I don't believe it."</p>

<p>Fever, sun, hallucination? Only in dreams and in
the delirium of fever do typical Arab potentates talk
colloquial English. These men <i>were</i> most obvious Arabs;
Arab to the last item of dress and accoutrement; Arab of
Arabs in every detail of appearance and deportment.</p>

<p>But could my eyes be normal while my ears deluded me?</p>

<p>No. This <i>was</i> real enough. This <i>was</i> my brother. This
man with him <i>was</i> talking English.</p>

<p>"<i>Noel!</i>" I said, beginning to recover and accept and
believe.</p>

<p>Noel winked heavily, and laughed derisively in a manner
most familiar. This was real enough anyhow.</p>

<p>"<i>Noel!</i>" I said again&mdash;helpless but beginning to
be hopeful.</p>

<p>"<i>Know-all!</i>" ejaculated the little man. "It's what
he thinks he is, anyhow.... But that ain't his name....
B'jiminy-gees, yes it is, though."...</p>

<p>And turning to Noel he said:</p>

<p>"You <i>said</i> your name was Know-all Hankinson Vanbrugh
... after Miss Mary come to the Oasis.... Gee! I believe
you had an accident and spoke the truth, Hank Sheikh....
Ain't it some world we live in!..."</p>

<p>"<i>Noel!</i>" I said again for the third time. "<i>Hell!</i> Am I
mad, or drunk, or dreaming or what?"</p>

<p>"Say, sport, if you're drunk, tell us where you got it,
quick," interrupted the little man urgently.</p>

<p>"<i>Oats!</i>" mocked my brother, my obvious, undeniable
indubitable brother, Noel.</p>

<p>"Say, did Mary send you?... I've been wearing
mourning for you, Son.... Mary said you were all shot
up, in Zaguig.... In a regular bad way about you
she was&mdash;only she was in a worse way about her
Beau...."</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;Beau Jolly," put in the incredible nightmare
Wazir. "Ol' friend o' mine, only he don't know it...."</p>

<p>"Mary been <i>here</i>?... Excuse me if I sit down.... Will
it be in order?..."</p>

<p>"No, most certainly not," said my brother. "Common
people like you don't sit down in the presence of royalty
... don't you know <i>that</i> much?... We'll go into the
parlour...."</p>

<p>And the two rose and led the way into the tent, the
Wazir dropping the felt curtain behind us as we entered.</p>

<p>And then my brother fell upon me, and there was no
illusion about the thump and hand-grip with which the
proceedings opened.</p>

<p>And Buddy was real. Quite as real as anybody I have ever
met, by the time he finished welcoming me as the accepted
and undeniable brother of "Hank Sheikh."</p>

<p>And at the tenth or perhaps twentieth attempt, sane
and coherent conversation took the place of ejaculation,
marvellings, and the callings upon various deities to bear
witness that this was indeed a staggerer.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"I am still dreaming, or wandering in my mind, Noel," I
found myself saying. "But <i>did</i> you say that Mary had been
here?"</p>

<p>"Not right here, but down this way.... In our home
town...."</p>

<p>It was his turn to marvel.</p>

<p>"And she never said a word!... Gee! And they say women
can't keep a secret...."</p>

<p>"It was to <i>you</i> then, that de Beaujolais was coming on
his secret mission from Zaguig.... And of course brought
Mary with him ..." I said.</p>

<p>"It certainly was, Boy.... But he didn't know it
then.... And he don't know it now.... And as far as you was
concerned you wasn't going to know it either, it seems....
Gee! What do you know about that, Son?... Good for lil'
Mary!..."</p>

<p>"She always loved you very dearly, Noel," I said.</p>

<p>My brother smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes, sure," he mused. "And now she loves de Beaujolais
a whole heap more very dearly.... It's for him, and from
him, she's keeping the State Secret."</p>

<p>"What?... Doesn't de Beaujolais know who you are?"</p>

<p>"Not a know to him," replied my brother. "He thinks
I am the Emir el Hamel el Kebir, Shadow of the Prophet,
Commander of the Faithful, Protector of the Poor ... Mahdi,
Shereef and Khalifa ... Overlord, Ruler, Spiritual Head and
War-Lord of the great Bedouin Confederation of the North
South Western Sahara ... Friend and ally of France.... So I
am too.... Three loud cheers."</p>

<p>"Don't foam at the ears, Son," observed the Wazir
gravely. "Mustn't let no loud cheers in the hearing of the
Injuns."</p>

<p>And then I sprang from my cushions and certainly there
could have been no sign of weakness about that uprising ...
and probably my hair stood as erect as I did.</p>

<p>"<i>Hank!</i>" I shouted, pointing in Noel's face.</p>

<p>"<i>Buddy!</i>" I yelped, pointing in the face of the little
man. They regarded me tolerantly.</p>

<p>"<i>Hank and Buddy!</i>" I cried. "<i>The men that John Geste
came back to look for!</i>... Hank went off and left them the
water.... Buddy stayed by sick John Geste and took him to
Kano.... Buddy went back to look for Hank.... John Geste
came back to look for Buddy...."</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>" the two shouted as one man.</p>

<p>"<i>Yes!</i>" I shouted in reply. "And <i>I</i> came out to look
for John Geste and <i>I found him</i>!... And Selim ben Yussuf
has just sold him back to the French, thinking it was
I...."</p>

<p>Both were staring.</p>

<p>"<i>Hell!</i>" growled my brother. "I'll take that Selim ben
Yussuf on the ball of my thumb and smear him on a wall ...
the damned dog's-dinner!"</p>

<p>And:</p>

<p>"I'll so take him to pieces that no-one won't ever be
able to put him together again," promised the little man.
"I'll sure disestablish him."</p>

<p>"God!" breathed my brother, "<i>John Geste?</i>"</p>

<p>"Say!" whispered Buddy. "John Geste come back to find
<i>me</i>?...</p>

<p>"What! Didn't his gel marry him then?..." he added.</p>

<p>"She did," I replied. "He went home nearly dead, and
they were married&mdash;and he could hardly eat, sleep
or breathe for thinking of you two in the hands of the
Arabs.... When he did get a sleep he'd start yelling,
'<i>Hank gave his life for me</i>' or, '<i>Buddy went back and I
slunk home</i>,' until his wife said what he'd been praying
God for her to say, and told him to come back and look for
you...."</p>

<p>"She must be a fine woman," said Noel.</p>

<p>"She's the finest and noblest woman in the
world&mdash;the truest, the sweetest and the loveliest...."
I said.</p>

<p>Noel gave me a long and searching look.</p>

<p>"Gee! I wisht I were an orayter!" said Buddy. "Sure
ain't it the biggest tale you ever heard tell!... And ain't
he the White Man?... My God, he's like his brothers!...
Come back to look for <i>me</i>!..."</p>

<p>And we three sat and stared at each other in silence,
each thinking his own thoughts, realizing fresh aspects of
this astounding business and trying to grasp the stunning
fact that, approaching from opposite directions, and in
ignorance of each other's movements, we had met at the
heart and centre of this wonderful maze of circumstance.</p>

<p>"And how in the name of the Almighty Marvellous, did
<i>you</i> come to know John Geste?" asked Noel suddenly.</p>

<p>"I knew all three of them," I said, "... when they were
kids.... Their home is at a place called Brandon Abbas, a
regular castle ... only a mile or two from Granny's place
at Brandon Regis...."</p>

<p>"If anyone rises to remark that it is a small world we
live in, I'll hand him one," observed Buddy. "Gee! Ain't it
some world!"</p>

<p>We pondered the smallness of the world and the marvels
packed into its limited space.</p>

<p>There literally was so much to be said that there was
nothing to say.</p>

<p>"And why on earth did those three boys from the Stately
Homes of England come to the Legion?" asked Noel. "The
three of them combined couldn't put up half a dirty trick,
if they gave their whole time to it."</p>

<p>"Beau Geste ran away and enlisted to shield a
girl&mdash;she's dead now&mdash;and the other two followed
him to share the blame."</p>

<p>"Something about a dam' great di'mond, weren't it?" said
Buddy.</p>

<p>"Something of the sort," I agreed.</p>

<p>"And how did you come to know that?" continued Noel.</p>

<p>"I met his wife in a Nursing-Home after I had been shot
up, in Zaguig," I said. "She was a kid at Brandon Abbas
too."</p>

<p>"And she told you that John Geste had come back to look
for <i>us</i>, she not knowing we were <i>your</i> Brother and Co.?"
said Noel.</p>

<p>"He come back to look fer <i>me</i>, I tell you," put in
Buddy. "He didn't give a curse for you, Hank Sheikh."</p>

<p>"And you offered to come and look for him?" continued
Noel, contemplating me thoughtfully. "And you joined the
Legion to get sent to the Zephyrs on the chance of getting
in touch with him....?</p>

<p>"Good Scout...." he murmured, and sat pondering,
stroking and fingering his beard in true Arab fashion.</p>

<p>"Well, Son, the good God Almighty meant you to find John
Geste," he observed at length. "Fancy your getting sent to
the same Battalion, and then being stuck down in the same
<i>silo</i> together, and then the Touareg swiping every living
Frenchman between there and Zaguig."</p>

<p>"Yes," I agreed. "... And this is what I want to
know.... How in the name of the Almighty Marvellous once
again, do <i>you</i> come to know all about <i>that</i>? Who told
<i>you</i> that there were two French convicts in Sheikh Yussuf
ben Amir's hands, and that they were saved from a <i>silo</i>
after a massacre?"</p>

<p>"Who saved you, Son?" smiled Noel.</p>

<p>"Three aged scarecrows&mdash;village beggars,
loafers.... United ages about three centuries ..." I
said.</p>

<p>"Meet Yacoub-who-goes-without-water and his two young
brothers...."</p>

<p>"Alf and Ed," murmured Buddy.</p>

<p>"... the Chiefs of my Desert Intelligence Department.
You were hardly above ground before I knew that there had
been a raid on the road-gangs, and you were hardly in the
power of Selim ben Yussuf, before I knew that a couple of
French prisoners had been found down a <i>silo</i>. I learnt
that much while I was on the way here.... I'm Keeper of the
Peace in these parts...."</p>

<p>"And the pieces..." murmured the Wazir.</p>

<p>"... And I rushed my Camel Corps straight for here
when Yacoub sent me word that the Touareg had got busy in
my country.... I surely will learn Mr. Selim ben Yussuf
a lesson he'll remember, and let him know who's Emir of
this Confederation&mdash;when there are any deals to be
done with the French.... It was his business to treat you
properly and to notify me that he'd got you....</p>

<p>"Yes, damn him," he went on. "It would have been you
he'd have handed over, but for that Death Angel girl....
And as it is, it's <i>John Geste</i>...."</p>

<p>"And now we got to go get John Geste...." put in
Buddy. "And that's a game what'll want some playing....
Blast Selim ben Yussuf.... I'll hang him on his own
innards....</p>

<p>"One thing," he added, "I kissed his gel for him, an'
that surely doth get the Arab goat <i>sur</i>-prising...."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Silence.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"Bud," said my brother to the Wazir, "we've built up
a big business here.... We've put the Injuns wise to a
lot of things.... We've made the old man's seat safe for
the boy.... We've taught 'em how to handle the Touareg,
and we've got 'em in right with the French.... It's
a fine, sound, going concern, with me President, you
Vice-President, and the Board of Directors hand-picked,
and a million francs invested under the old apple tree....
We're made for life.... We pay our own salaries and we fix
our own pensions ... also age of retirement...."</p>

<p>"Sure, Hank Sheikh," said his Wazir. "We sure are the
deserving rich...."</p>

<p>"... On velvet," continued my brother. "Just made good
and got all the lovely things that was coming to us....
Why, we're Near-Emperors.... Sure-enough Presidents of a
Republic, anyhow.... And now here this John Geste comes
along, gets into the Zephyrs, Our Own Representative gets
him out, and he gets in again.... Are we to lose everything
to save him again?... <i>Let's leave him where he is</i>...."</p>

<p>"Let's don't, Hank Sheikh," replied the Wazir.</p>

<p>"Are we to undo our life's work?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said the Wazir promptly.</p>

<p>"Are we to lose everything we've worked and toiled and
suffered and risked our lives for?"</p>

<p>"Every last thing," agreed the Wazir.</p>

<p>"Are we to break our Treaty with the French?... Break
our word to the Tribes?... Break the hearts of the men who
love and trust us?..."</p>

<p>"Break everything," assented the Wazir.</p>

<p>"Are we to start life afresh at our age?... Take the
road again?..."</p>

<p>"Sure.... Take the road and everything else we can
get.... What's bitin' you, you ol' fool?"</p>

<p>"You mean you'll throw away <i>everything</i>&mdash;chuck up
the grandest golden success two hungry hoboes ever made....
Go back from wealthy prince to tramping beggar?"...</p>

<p>"Ain't our friend in trouble, Hank?" replied Buddy.
"What you talkin' about?"</p>

<p>"Shake, Son," said my brother. And the two men shook
hands.</p>

<p>"Some folk'd say our duty to the French and these Arabs
came first," said Noel.</p>

<p>"Let 'em say," answered Buddy.</p>

<p>"Some folk'd say a man ought not to go back on his
word," continued Noel.</p>

<p>"<i>Word!</i>" spat Buddy. "Ain't our friend in trouble?
What's the word you've spoke, against the word you
<i>haven't</i> spoke?... That you stand by your pard through
thick and thin.... You remember what you said to me, Hank
Sheikh?... '<i>It's all accordin' to what they call your "Bo
Ideel."</i>'"</p>

<p>"Goo' Boy," observed my brother, taking the small man
by the scruff of the neck and shaking him affectionately.
"When your friend's in need, he's your friend indeed."</p>

<p>"Sure thing, Hank Sheikh.... For a minute I wondered if
you'd gone batty in the belfry or woozy in the works."</p>

<p>"I was only trying you out, Son.... I apologize...."</p>

<p>"So you oughter, Hank Sheikh," snorted Buddy.</p>

<p>"Don't think I doubted you, Son, but I thought I'd
remind you that it's a hard row to hoe, and ruin at the end
of it."</p>

<p>"Harder for you, Old Hoss," grinned Buddy. "You got a
wife, an' I ain't.... Me!... I got more sense...."</p>

<p>"Married, Noel?... My congratulations.... An Arab lady?"
I said. "Why, no, of course, I remember ... the Death Angel
said you'd married an English girl like herself...."</p>

<p>"An English girl&mdash;very unlike herself," replied
Noel, and eyed me queerly.</p>

<p>"I shall look forward to meeting her and paying my
respects as a brother-in-law," I said, wondering what sort
of extraordinary person my brother could have picked up in
this part of the world.</p>

<p>"You have met her, Oats," replied Noel, and I stared
astounded, beginning to wonder again whether this were not,
after all, an extraordinary dream.</p>

<p>No, it was not a dream. It was more like a good dream
wasted.</p>

<p>"Met her?" I said. "Where?"</p>

<p>"She was a Miss Maud Atkinson," said my brother with
excellent nonchalance, and both he and Buddy watched me
expectant, and, I thought, a little on the defensive.</p>

<p>I don't think my jaw dropped, nor my face expressed
anything other than what I wished them to see.</p>

<p>"Congratulations again, Noel," I cried. "When I
congratulated you before, it was the usual form of
words.... I can now congratulate you on having married one
of the bravest and best little women that ever lived. She
went <i>literally</i> through fire to help a friend&mdash;in a
burning house in England.... She's pure gold."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Oats," said my brother, extending his
hand.</p>

<p>"Nearly married her meself," observed Buddy glumly. "He
butted in, the day before.... Stuck his great hoof in our
love affair before I ..."</p>

<p>Spreading a useful hand across his Wazir's face, the
Emir thrust his Minister out of the conversation.</p>

<p>"And Mary never told you <i>that</i> ..." continued Noel.</p>

<p>"No.... She just mentioned that Maudie was married,"
said I. "Doesn't she rather complicate the situation?"</p>

<p>"Like Hell she does," pondered Noel. "She'd be the first
to chase me off to get John Geste.... She'd never forgive
us if she knew we'd left a friend in trouble...."</p>

<p>"Where is she now?" I asked.</p>

<p>"At my headquarters at the Great Oasis," replied my
brother. "In the charge of my Council and a great old bird
who is Regent of my chief tribe.... At least they think she
is in their charge.... As a matter of fact she is the best
man of the lot."</p>

<p>"Did she marry you as an Arab?" I asked.</p>

<p>"She married me as a Lovely Sheikh, out of a book," was
the reply. "Going to marry me again as a common man, out of
a job, when we go home.... I'm still a bit of a mystery to
her.... Girls like mysteries.... She always wanted a Sheikh
and now she's got one.... And she's a <i>houri</i>...."</p>

<p>"Wicked shame," muttered the Wazir. "Married the gel
under false pretences.... Tole her he'd bought a book
an' learned English so as he could talk to her&mdash;the
rambunctious ole goat.... Spoilt the one and only love
affair of my life...."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Son," soothed the Emir. "You started
another last night."</p>

<p>"I certainly did," agreed Buddy with prideful mien.
"I'll tell the world she fell for me, right there.... And
she cert'nly is the Tough Baby.... I'm going over to call
on her, bye-and-bye."</p>

<p>"You certainly made an impression on her," I said. "She
spoke of you when she returned from the visit."</p>

<p>"And that brings us to the point," said Noel. "She
tells me that Selim ben Yussuf handed a convict over to
a <i>peloton méhariste</i> some days ago; and that means that
he was taken straight to Zaguig, examined on the subject
of the Arab raid, and sent back to a road-gang.... Now by
the mercy of God, old Yacoub-who-goes-without-water knows
his face&mdash;and I back him to pick him out from ten
thousand.... I'll have him and his gang off within the
hour, and as soon as John Geste is working on the road
again, I shall know it...."</p>

<p>"What will Yacoub do?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Everybody," grunted the Wazir.</p>

<p>"Beg mostly," replied my brother. "Loaf about ...
cadge ... steal rusty cans and run for his life ...
look silly ... do a bit of water-carrying ... pick up
a job ... hold a horse ... lead a camel.... They're
the three finest old actors that never went on the
stage.... Believe me, Henry Irving never had anything on
Yacoub-who-goes-without-water...."</p>

<p>"And when he locates him?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Them <i>un</i>corrigible Touaregs again ..." suggested the
Wazir. "There'll be another raid and John Geste will be
took captive by them.... Even the Zephyrs will pity the
pore feller...."</p>

<p>"That's the scheme," said Noel. "It'll want some
planning.... I don't want to hurt anybody, and I don't want
to get my people shot up, either; but John Geste's coming
right out of that road-gang...."</p>

<p>"I get the idea," I mused. "In the meantime what becomes
of me?"</p>

<p>"You're dead and buried, Son.... Your ghost turns Injun
and stays with us, keeping its face hidden.... We'll brown
it up a bit...."</p>

<p>"But there are half a dozen people who know I'm alive,"
I said. "The lot out there who brought me over...."</p>

<p>"That's Miss Death Angel's trouble...." replied my
brother. "They're her people.... It's up to her to see they
don't squeal about her little games, to Selim ben Yussuf,
or anybody else....</p>

<p>"I don't think they'll talk much, when I've had a word
with them," he added, and the Wazir chuckled grimly.</p>

<p>"I'm dead of course, as far as the French are
concerned," I remarked.</p>

<p>"You perished in the massacre, Son.... Poor old John
will be in a bad way," he continued. "He can't very well
tell the French you're alive and ought to be rescued from
the wild Bedouin, and he can't very well leave you to be
tortured by Selim ben Yussuf, as he thinks...."</p>

<p>"I suppose Selim ben Yussuf couldn't do any good, if you
were to put the screw on him?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," replied my brother. "<i>He</i> can't do anything....
Once he's handed an escaped prisoner back, there's an end
of it.... I myself couldn't do a thing, although I'm Emir
of the Confederated tribes of the Great Oasis, and ally of
France.</p>

<p>"... No, Selim can only tell me all about the patrol and
then take what's coming to him.... The fool!... The damned
impudent presumptuous <i>fool</i>!... Why, I could prevent him
succeeding his father as Sheikh of his Tribe.... If I were
staying on, that is ..." and he smiled wryly. "I'll get
him, as it is ... if he comes back in time...."</p>

<p>"He's bound to come back soon, I should think," said I.
"The girl expected him to roll up at any minute. In fact,
when we heard the commotion of your arrival, we thought he
had come...."</p>

<p>"What's the position there exactly ... d'you know?"
asked Noel.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied. "I do.... It's the hell of a
position.... Selim is madly infatuated with the girl, which
you can quite understand.... And the girl is apparently
madly infatuated with me ... which you probably cannot
understand....</p>

<p>"I met them both in Bouzen a long time ago, and the
trouble began as far back as that.... Selim was after her
then, and wanted to stab me because she singled me out at a
dancing-show....</p>

<p>"I gather that, being heartily tired of Town, she came
for 'a day in the country' ... Giving Selim a trial trip
before marrying him, perhaps.... Just as likely to become
his step-mama I should say...."</p>

<p>"And then you came on the scene and the scene was
changed...." suggested my brother. "Friend Selim did
himself some good when he brought you home, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... And me too ..." I sighed. "I paid her rather a
high price for my freedom to go off again in search of John
Geste.... Noel, old chap, <i>couldn't</i> you have come a day
sooner?..."</p>

<p>"No, Son ... nor an hour.... Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I made a fair and square bargain with the Death
Angel that I'd come back to her as soon as I had seen
John Geste out of the country, or else at the end of a
year...."</p>

<p>"Come back to her?... What for?..." asked my brother.</p>

<p>"To marry her," I said.</p>

<p>My brother stared incredulous, and then laughed
harshly.</p>

<p>"Marry her?... Well, that's an engagement that'll be
broken off," smiled he.</p>

<p>"Not by me, Noel," I told him. "It's a 'gentleman's
agreement.'... I gave her my word and my hand on it.... She
has done her part and I'll have to do mine. Just as soon as
we've got John Geste out of the country..."</p>

<p>"You'll come too, Son&mdash;if you have to come in a
sack," affirmed my brother.</p>

<p>"Noel," I said, "listen.... Before you came, this girl
made a bargain with me. On her side she was to help me get
John Geste out of the country.... In return for that help,
I gave her my solemn promise that I would come back. And I
shall do so...."</p>

<p>"I get you, Son," he answered thoughtfully.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Silence fell, and we sat, each thinking his own
thoughts&mdash;if gazing in wonderment upon incredible but
undeniable facts, can be called thought.</p>

<p>The Wazir was the first to break the silence, and the
trend of his cogitations was apparent.</p>

<p>"Do I understand that you are reg'larly engaged to this
young woman then?" he asked purposefully.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said.</p>

<p>"You <i>would</i> be ..." he observed glumly, and in reply to
the inquiry of my raised eyebrow, added:</p>

<p>"I was going to propose to her meself, to-day...."</p>

<p>"Then I sincerely hope you'll do it, and be entirely
successful," I replied.</p>

<p>"Well, you cut in first, Bo.... We'll leave it at
that.... I ain't bad at heart...."</p>

<p>"No. It's your head that's bad," observed my brother.
"Brains went bad long ago.... Now stop jabbering and put
Marbruk ben Hassan wise.... I want Yacoub here quicker than
Marbruk can get him...."</p>

<p>The Wazir left the tent.</p>

<p>"Who <i>is</i> he, Noel?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The biggest little man that ever lived.... And my
friend," replied my brother. "I took up with him when I
ran away from home, and we've been together ever since....
He's the bravest man I ever saw and there never lived a
stauncher.... He's true, Son.... And when you want him,
he's <i>there</i>...."</p>

<p>"What's that language he talks?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, he was born in the Bowery, New York, and that's
his mother tongue.... And he got his schooling in South
State Street and Cottage Grove Avenue, Chicago, and the
slums thereabout, and he talks the dialect.... He graduated
on the water-front at San Francisco, and learnt some good
language there.... He was a bar-keep in Seattle, and went
to the gold-diggings.... He was a cow-puncher in Texas
and Arizona, and he's used the roads of the U.S.A. a
lot&mdash;and the railways more so, but I don't think he
ever bought a ticket...."</p>

<p>"And why do you talk like him when you are talking to
him?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Because I've got good manners," replied Noel. "And
what's good enough for Bud is good enough for me....</p>

<p>"Now you stay where you are for a bit, Son," he
continued. "I'm going to hold a <i>mejliss</i> and get
busy...."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>A few minutes later, the Emir and his Wazir were seated
on the carpet and cushions of State outside the big tent in
which I was concealed.</p>

<p>The Oriental Potentate was seated in judgment; if not
"in the city gate" as of old, then in the door of his tent
and shadow of the palm, as in days far older.</p>

<p>The dwarf, Marbruk ben Hassan, brought to the
judgment-seat the party who had escorted me.</p>

<p>"And so there were two <i>Roumi</i> prisoners ..." said the
deep voice of the Emir, "... and one of them was given up
to the French, and the other died.... Is it not so?..."</p>

<p>"It is so; O, Emir," said the voice of the good
<i>hakim</i>.</p>

<p>"It is so indeed; O, Emir," said Abd'allah ibn
Moussa.</p>

<p>And the voices of the servants chorused the refrain.</p>

<p>"And his body was buried in the sand," continued the
Emir. "You were all present I think?"</p>

<p>"All; O, Emir ..." was the unanimous reply.</p>

<p>"There could be no mistake about it?" suggested the
Emir. "I should be sorry for one who made a mistake about
it.... Sorry for him, and his son, his son's son, and his
wives and his children, his camels, his goats, and all that
he had."</p>

<p>All appeared perfectly certain that there could be no
mistake on the subject.</p>

<p>"Was it a deep grave or a shallow grave, in which you
buried this unfortunate prisoner?" pursued the Emir.</p>

<p>And it was the voice of Abd'allah that answered
promptly:</p>

<p>"Oh, a very shallow grave; O, Emir.... It might be found
that jackals had removed the body ... should any search be
now made for it...."</p>

<p>And the voice of the <i>hakim</i> chimed in with:</p>

<p>"And it was a much-trodden spot, O, Emir, near the
camel-enclosure.... A very difficult spot to find ... even
had the jackals not rifled the grave...."</p>

<p>"It is well," concluded the Emir. "Go in peace, making
no mistake ... for my arm is long&mdash;long as the Tail of
the Horse of the Prophet." </p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="first">
I spent the following days in a curious condition
of mind, and much comfort of body. I had complete and
much-needed rest, and freedom from all personal anxiety
and fear; and my hope concerning John Geste was rising
high.... I had had him in my hands and I should have him
again....</p>

<p>This brother of mine was a strong man&mdash;a strong man
armed&mdash;influential and powerful, unless he came into
deliberate conflict with the French, whose friend and ally
he was.</p>

<p>With him I was absolutely safe, and, though idly
quiescent myself, I felt that everything possible was being
done to further my affairs&mdash;which were now equally
those of my brother and his friend.</p>

<p>I could lie upon my cushions, resting and relaxed, yet
happy in the knowledge that more was being done to further
John Geste's rescue than at any time since Isobel had told
me of his capture.</p>

<p>I could not talk with these two without becoming imbued
with a feeling of completest confidence. They were so
sure that their Desert Intelligence&mdash;which had never
yet failed them&mdash;would speedily discover John's
whereabouts, and that their brave and faithful fighting-men
would effect his rescue.</p>

<p>Naturally I had my moments of fear, gloom, anxiety and
doubt, but I had my hours of hope and joy, and certitude
that all would be well, and that I should live to see John
Geste step upon the deck of a British or American ship.</p>

<p>And at that point I always awakened myself from my
day-dream and refused to envisage the future.</p>

<p>Life&mdash;with the Angel of Death as my wife!</p>

<p>Well, I must make the best of it, and the best of
her. There is good in everyone, and, probably, in her
way&mdash;and given a fair chance&mdash;she was quite as
"good" as I was.... And in any case I should be a happy
man, if only I succeeded in saving John....</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>I grew very near to my brother again, during this
brief period of waiting, this tiny oasis in the desert of
strenuous life, and got to know him very well.</p>

<p>The more I learned, the more was I filled with
admiration at his astounding feat&mdash;his rising by
sheer unaided ability, from being a practically dead man,
possessed of the remains of one ragged garment and nothing
else, to his present position&mdash;as a man of wealth,
power and importance.</p>

<p>His was indeed a wonderful story, and in my private mind
I ranked him with such men as that Burton who became an
Arab and made the pilgrimage to Mecca, earning the title of
<i>Haji</i>, a Mussulman of Mussulmans.</p>

<p>Little wonder that Major de Beaujolais, with all
his Secret Service training, had found no grounds for
suspicion, since the Arabs themselves believed him to be an
Arab.</p>

<p>His years of wandering in the desert with John and Digby
Geste must have been a hard apprenticeship, but the only
possible one for such success as this.</p>

<p>And the same applied to my brother's <i>fidus Achates</i>,
Buddy.</p>

<p>Neither of them was a man of book-education, but
both were men of brains, ability, determination and
character.</p>

<p>Noel was his father's son there, but oh, how different a
man&mdash;with his wise broad tolerance.</p>

<p>When I endeavoured to discover Noel's mental attitude
to our Father, I was somewhat baffled, but came to the
conclusion that if he did not still actually hate him, he
thought of him with some bitterness, and promised himself
the pleasure of, some day, returning home, and "having it
out" with him, "mastering him" as he expressed it....</p>

<p>Not in a spirit of bitterness and revenge, or with the
least idea of humiliating him, but rather as a sop to his
own self-respect and to meet him on an equality, on his
own level, and as man to man; and particularly, I think,
Noel wished to demonstrate to him that a son of Homer H.
Vanbrugh could, unaided, amount to something, without
dwelling for ever in Homer H. Vanbrugh's pocket, or in the
shadow of his crushing and overwhelming bulk.</p>

<p>Not only did my affection for my brother increase, as we
talked together, but my respect also. And I envied him....
He was the Happy Warrior. He had deliberately chosen the
way of life that suited him, and for which he was suited,
rejecting the job of rich man's son, offered him by
circumstance, and going out into the high-ways and by-ways
of the world, the open roads that called to him.</p>

<p>He had climbed a steep and rugged path, and he had
enjoyed the effort and the danger. He had made contact with
realities, looked life in the face, and acknowledged the
great God of Things As They Are.</p>

<p>And of all the interesting things about him, what
interested me most was the fact that, having literally and
actually been crowned with success, he was, without an
instant's hesitation, prepared to cast that crown away at a
word&mdash;a word of a friend in danger.</p>

<p>A crown was not his <i>beau idéal</i>.</p>

<p>A man who thought like Don Quixote though he chose to
talk like Sancho Panza.</p>

<p>And, too, the more I saw of his friend, the more I liked
and respected him, for my brother's standards and values
were his in equal measure.</p>

<p>To what extent this was due to the uninfluenced nature
of the man, and how much to the fact that my brother was
his untarnishable hero, and impeccable model, I do not
know&mdash;and if the latter, the more credit to him that
such a man could be his ideal.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;I liked Buddy. And I wrote him down a bold,
unconquerable spirit, sterling and faithful and fine. </p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p> "Lie low, Son," whispered my brother, entering my
comfortable tent wherein I lay restfully at peace&mdash;in
the peace of the great desert.</p>

<p>"French patrol coming.... You're all right behind that
face-stain&mdash;your own father wouldn't know you.... No
need to chuck your weight about though.... If you like to
put an eye to one crack and an ear to another, you may have
some fun...."</p>

<p>It wasn't exactly fun, but it was very interesting, to
hear the officers of the Patrol talking with the Emir el
Hamel el Kebir and the Sheikh el Habibka el Wazir, over
their three rounds of ceremonial and complimentary mint
tea.</p>

<p>Marvellous was the impassive Arab dignity with which
the Emir, his Wazir, Sheikhs and chief men met and
greeted the French <i>sous-officier</i> and his European
subordinates, and with which they conducted them to the
rug-and-cushion-strewn carpet before the Emir's tent.</p>

<p>When all customary and proper formalities had been
observed, the French <i>sous-officier</i> got down to
business.</p>

<p>It appeared that the French authorities at Zaguig
appreciated the Emir's prompt action in hurrying to the
scene of the massacre, and hoped that, by now, he had some
information on the subject of the raiders....</p>

<p>Of course the Touareg at once came under suspicion...
but it was easy to cry, "<i>Touareg</i>"&mdash;and there were
certain features of the raid that might or might not
indicate Touareg.... The said features might have been
covered by the Touareg face-veil, so to speak....</p>

<p>But, and here was a point to consider, might not those
veils have been borrowed, and might they not have veiled
features that were not those of Touareg faces at all?</p>

<p>There were reasons for thinking so, and if the slaughter
had been Touareg handiwork, why was the life of at least
one of the road-gang spared?... And how had this man come
to be in the hands of Selim ben Yussuf?</p>

<p>The convict himself would say nothing ... absolutely
nothing ... though he had undoubtedly received every
encouragement to speak. (My fists clenched as I listened
and thought of poor John.... I cursed the Angel of
Death.)... Of course he may have been knocked on the head
and really remember nothing, as he said.... But <i>how</i> did
Selim ben Yussuf get him?...</p>

<p>And what exactly was Selim ben Yussuf doing within a few
miles of where the massacre took place?</p>

<p>Old Sheikh Yussuf ben Amir, his father, was all-right,
no doubt, but Selim ben Yussuf was quite another
coco-nut....</p>

<p>His record was a bad one, or rather it was a record of
strong continual suspicions.... It was firmly believed
that he had been prominent in the Zaguig massacre, though
as there was no survivor of that, except an American
tourist, no evidence could be got against him. (Here I
was indeed interested.)... Still, Major de Beaujolais had
reported that he had seen Selim in Zaguig just before the
massacre&mdash;and pray where was the gentleman at this
very minute?...</p>

<p>The Emir stroked and fingered his beard, gravely nodding
as the Frenchman talked.... And the Emir's Wazir stroked
and fingered his beard, gravely and wisely nodding as his
master did so.</p>

<p>It appeared that the Emir had himself entertained
suspicions concerning Selim ben Yussuf, and had his eye
upon him ... and in fact, the sole reason why he remained
encamped at this spot, with his Camel-Corps, was to see
whether Selim returned to the Tribe and, meanwhile, to make
wide inquiry as to his whereabouts and movements.</p>

<p>And had the Emir heard the rumour which <i>l'Adjudant</i>
Lebaudy had picked up somewhere ... that Selim ben Yussuf
had had <i>two</i> French prisoners?</p>

<p>Here the Emir stroked his beard very thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"If he has another prisoner, he has taken him with
him," he said. "There is absolutely no question whatever
of there being another French prisoner in their camp over
there...."</p>

<p>"That's certain, is it?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"As absolutely certain as that Mahommed is the Prophet
of Allah.... Have a tent-to-tent visitation if you like,
but 'twill be but a waste of time ..." said the Emir.</p>

<p>"It would be like the young fox," he added, thoughtfully
frowning, "if he <i>did</i> have two, to give one up in token of
good faith, and to keep the other as a hostage&mdash;or to
torture, if he hates the <i>Roumi</i> as some say...."</p>

<p>"H'm.... Give up one to show his love, and keep one upon
whom to show his hate, eh?" said the Frenchman.</p>

<p>The Emir then inquired as to this curious rumour,
and learned that an Arab <i>méhariste</i> with <i>l'Adjudant</i>
Lebaudy's patrol had been told by a boy, a goat-herd, of
whom he bought some dates, that there had been two <i>Roumi</i>
prisoners, but one was said to have died....</p>

<p>Probably nothing in it&mdash;except that one of
the Secret Service spies had also brought in a story,
admittedly somewhat fantastic, about a <i>Roumi</i> prisoner
having been tortured to death by a woman....</p>

<p>The Emir did not appear to be impressed.</p>

<p>"It'll be ten by the New Moon ..." he smiled. "However,
our young friend, Selim, shall enlighten us.... Oh, yes ...
Selim shall talk...."</p>

<p>"Selim shall squeal, eh?" smiled the French officer
grimly.</p>

<p>The Emir looked up.</p>

<p>"What does old Sheikh Yussuf ben Amir say?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He says he knows absolutely nothing about either
Selim's movements or about Selim's prisoner or prisoners,
and I think he is speaking the truth...."</p>

<p>And the Emir bade the officer rest assured that he, El
Hamel el Kebir, would know the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, as to there having been one or two
French prisoners in the hands of Selim ben Yussuf, and as
to the precise manner in which that suspect had acquired
them.</p>

<p>One more thing&mdash;and the officer picked up his
riding-switch and <i>képi</i>&mdash;orders were coming, for
Sheikh Yussuf ben Amir's tribe, to migrate at once to the
Oasis of Sidi Usman, near Bouzen, there to concentrate and
remain until further notice.</p>

<p>Would the Emir facilitate their departure and keep a
patrol in the neighbourhood, so long as it seemed likely
that Selim ben Yussuf, and the fighting-men with him, might
return to where he had left the tribe encamped.... </p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p> And, next day, as we three sat in dignified isolation
apart from all men, a servant came running, spoke to the
Soudanese sentry&mdash;whose business it was to see that
none unauthorized approached within hearing&mdash;and drew
near.</p>

<p>"Yacoub-who-goes-without-water sends a messenger; O,
Emir," the man said, making obeisance.</p>

<p>"Bring him instantly, el R'Orab," ordered the Emir,
and, a minute or two later, an aged and filthy beggar
approached, a man so old and decrepit that the flesh of
his bent and trembling legs seemed covered in dry grey
scales rather than brown human skin. His face expressed
nothing but senile imbecility and, as his shrivelled lips
opened, exposing the toothless gums and a tongue like that
of a parrot, one expected to hear nothing but the shrill
piping voice of a pitiable dotard, well advanced in second
childhood.</p>

<p>Supporting his emaciated frame with the help of a staff,
he salaamed profoundly, glanced at me inquiringly, and,
on receiving the Emir's kind permission to speak freely,
changed astonishingly.</p>

<p>Certainly he was still a dirty old man, but one whose
face now expressed shrewdness, alertness, and ripe wisdom.
A hopeless, helpless, doddering old pantaloon turned,
before my eyes, into an extremely knowing, spry and
competent old gentleman.</p>

<p>"May the Sidi Emir live for ever!" quoth he, "and
dwell in the protection of Allah and the care of His
Prophet.... Humblest greetings from his meanest slave,
Yacoub-who-goes-without-water, and this message....</p>

<p>"'Know, O, Emir, that the <i>Roumi</i> prisoner sold by
Sheikh Selim ben Yussuf to the <i>Franzawi</i> was taken to
the city of Zaguig and there cast into prison.... At the
gate of the prison have I sat, a blind and naked beggar,
asking "Alms for the love of Allah! Alms for the love of
Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate...." I have not
left this place by day nor by night, and all who have
entered in unto it, and all who have come out of it, have
I seen.... Yea, every one.... And behold, three times has
the <i>Roumi</i> prisoner been taken by soldiers from this old
prison to the new barracks.... And three times has he
been brought back.... Each time did I follow afar off,
and what happened when he was taken to the barracks of
the <i>Franzawi</i> soldiers, I do not know, save that high
officers assembled and questioned him ... for I climbed on
the back of a passing camel and saw through the iron bars
of the "hole through which one looks out."*</p>

<p class="footnote">* Window. </p>

<p>"'... And the fourth time he was taken from the prison,
he marched with others like him, and with soldiers about
them, down the Road that the <i>Franzawi</i> build from Zaguig
to the Great Oasis.... And each night they halted for a
night in an armed camp.... And now he, and those others
with him, have come to the place of the deserted village,
and they carry on the work of those that are dead.... With
my own eyes I am watching this man and with my brother's
voice am I speaking these words.... And may the peace
of Allah abide with the Sidi Emir, and encompass him
about....'</p>

<p>"And that is the message of my brother,
Yacoub-who-goes-without-water, O Lord...."</p>

<p>And:</p>

<p>"It is well," replied the Emir. "Go and eat."</p>

<p>And as the intelligent old gentleman lapsed back into
the idiot centenarian and tottered out of earshot:</p>

<p>"Good God above us!" said Noel. "<i>John Geste!</i> John
Geste, himself, is not ten miles away from where we're
sitting now, Otis!"</p>

<p>And I could answer nothing. </p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p> We instantly became a Council of War.</p>

<p>My brother is a man of prompt action, but he is not of
those who act first and think afterwards. I imagine his
marvellous success among the Arabs was as much due to his
wisdom in the Council-tent as to skill and courage on the
battle-field.</p>

<p>In the strange rôle that my brother played at this
period of his life, tactics and strategy counted for more
than swashbuckling. It interested me greatly to see how he
considered the views and opinions of Buddy and myself, and
then of his most trusted Arab lieutenants, weighed them
carefully, discussed them, and then produced his own, and
his reasons for holding them.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as I had worked in the road-gang and knew, to
the last detail, the method and routine of the daily and
nightly procedure, my advice was asked, my suggestions
invited, and I was flatteringly bidden to say precisely
what I would do if I were the executive in charge of the
work of rescue.</p>

<p>To me, it at once appeared that there were two methods
open to us&mdash;that of force, and that of guile, and I
promptly propounded this platitude.</p>

<p>"Take the force-idea first, Son," said Noel, "bearing in
mind it's not to be a raid like this last one. I'll have
John Geste if I kill every Arab and Frenchman in Africa,
but I intend to get him without killing anybody."</p>

<p>"That rather cramps one's style for force, doesn't it?"
I said. "Limits one's scope of action, a little.... What
would happen if we swooped down upon the working-party in
overwhelming strength, but unarmed.... Simply kidnapped
John by main force.... We three seize him, while a hundred
good men and true scatter everybody, all ends up, and we
ride for it?"</p>

<p>"What would happen, Son?... We should leave about thirty
dead ... probably including John Geste and certainly
ourselves.... As I say, I don't want anybody killed,
especially my own men...."</p>

<p>"What about a hand-picked party, to surround the spot in
the dark, and shoot straight and fast&mdash;but high....
While they're carefully hitting nobody, we three, armed,
say, with 'a foot of lead-pipe' each, dash in and get
John...."</p>

<p>"Dash in and don't get John," said my brother. "We get
about seven bullets each, instead...."</p>

<p>"Well ... what about this idea?... Let your man, Yacoub,
get a word of warning to John to be <i>ready</i> at sunset
to-morrow ... expecting something to happen.... Then let
Selim ben Yussuf's tribe start their trek in the afternoon,
and pass along the road just before the gang is due to
stop work.... All your men might join in the procession,
camels and all complete, and the more dust they raise the
better.... We three, and a few chosen lads who can be
trusted, can be in a bunch, and one of us carry a spare
<i>haik</i> and <i>burnous</i>.... As we pass and jostle along the
road, Yacoub gets beside John and says 'Now!' to him, and
I shout 'Come on, John.'... He just steps into the midst
of the crowd and we throw the spare <i>burnous</i> round him to
hide his uniform, and he pulls it over his face.... Let
Buddy be leading a spare camel, and we three push forward
as quickly as we can, to the head of the column, and then
ride for it...." My brother smiled.</p>

<p>"Bright idea, Oats," he said kindly. "But it would be
'Keep off the grass' as soon as the mob tried to use the
Road.... '<i>At the stiffs in front, at five hundred metres,
seven rounds rapid fire.</i>'... No, Son ... especially after
the recent raid, no clouds of dust are coming near any
Zephyr party. Neither along the Road nor across it...."</p>

<p>"Well, let's try guile," I said. "What about old Yacoub
slipping John a file and hanging around until John makes a
quiet get-away.... We're waiting near, with fast camels,
and old Yacoub brings him to us...."</p>

<p>"Waiting how long, Son? We might grow grey, or strike
roots into the earth before John got his chance.... There
won't be much slackness for a long time to come....
Suppose he's caught using the file?... Suppose he is shot,
getting away?... You know about how many single-handed
escape-attempts succeed...."</p>

<p>"What about this?..." I tried again.</p>

<p>"Supposing you, in your own proper person, as the
Emir el Hamel el Kebir, in your whitest robes, heavy
corded silk head-dress and scarlet and gold camel-hair
ropes round your head, visited that particular section
of the Road&mdash;with your Wazir, and high Sheikhs,
chief executioner, cup-bearer, baker, butler, soothsayer,
and holy panjandrum and all&mdash;and had an afternoon
tea-party with the nice friendly White Men.... And while
all goes merrier than a marriage-bell, there is a sudden
raid by a few score of your best, unarmed ... and, as
they appear, some of us seize the rifles of our friends,
and the rest of us seize the friends themselves.... While
we hang on to them&mdash;grapple them to our hearts with
hoops of steel, so to speak&mdash;the new-comers guided by
Yacoub, simply cut out John from the herd and make their
get-away...."</p>

<p>"Leaving us in the soup, like ..." murmured Buddy.
"Well ... we'd have the rifles, and they'd simply have to
'hands up' while we backed away to our camels and cleared
off...."</p>

<p>"Gee! Hasn't he got a mind, Hank Sheikh," admired Buddy.
"He sure is your brother.... Sim'lar kind o' train-hold-up
nature...."</p>

<p>"It's a scheme," mused Noel. "It's an idea, Bud...."</p>

<p>"Or there's that <i>silo</i>," I suggested. "Suppose Yacoub
provisioned it, and we three made a regular Red Indian
swift-and-silent sort of raid, dressed in brown paint and
coco-nut-oil.... We might get him and rush to that <i>silo</i>
and lie low there ..."</p>

<p>"'Down among the dead men,'" murmured Buddy.</p>

<p>"... until the first wild hurroosh is over.... That
wouldn't lead a pursuit back to your own camp, either....
Sneak away from the <i>silo</i> the following night to where
Yacoub has the camels...."</p>

<p>Noel shook his head.</p>

<p>"Too risky, Son," he mused. "That <i>silo</i> may have been
discovered and be in use again.... And if it hasn't, it
sure is an unhealthy spot.... What's your idea, Bud?" he
continued, turning to his friend.</p>

<p>"Well, Hank Sheikh, I'd like a good up-and-down
dawg-fight&mdash;a free-for-all, knock-down-an'-drag-out,
go-as-you-please, bite-kick-or-gouge turn-up&mdash;an' run
that boy, John Geste, outa gaol.... Life's gettin' a dam'
sight too peaceful.... An' you're gettin' fat....</p>

<p>"But since you've got so partic'lar an' no poor
fightin'-man's to get hurt, what about dopin' the guard?...
Have a party.... Have a supper-party an' hand out the free
drinks generous an' hearty <i>an'</i> doped.... You don't taste
<i>hashish</i> in coffee, an' if we couldn't do anything else,
we could work off three rounds of sweet coffee an' three
rounds of mint-tea on 'em ... not to mention something
funny in the <i>cous-cous</i>.... Nothin' serious.... In the
mawnin' twenty-five headaches <i>come</i>, an' one prisoner
<i>gone</i>.... Hardly worth noticin'...."</p>

<p>"Gee! Hasn't he got a mind, Oats?" admired the Emir.
"Filled with treacly treachery, putrid poison, and mouldy
mellow-drama.... But it cert'nly is an idea...."</p>

<p>He turned to Buddy.</p>

<p>"Don't I seem to remember we already had one
misfortunate igsperience with poison, Son?"</p>

<p>"Misfortunate Hell!" snorted Buddy. "It clinched the
deal anyhow.... That's all the thanks <i>I</i> get.... That, and
a broken heart...." he added.</p>

<p>"It's an idea, Son.... It cert'nly is an idea...."
admitted Noel. "The fierce and treacherous Sheikh stuff,
eh? Invite 'em to a hash party an' poison 'em ..."</p>

<p>"Look here, Noel," I broke in, "excuse the question....
But where do you draw the line?... You want no bloodshed,
and I can quite understand that, and I entirely agree....
But about the treachery part of it, since the word's been
used.... If I know you, old chap, and I think I do, you'll
hate that more than a fair and square fight&mdash;openly
showing your hand as having suddenly become an enemy of the
French...."</p>

<p>"I needn't appear in the fair-and-square fight, Son,"
replied my brother.</p>

<p>"I could very easily turn a picked lot of my braves into
Touareg, and let there be another raid.... When the Guard
was disposed of, Yacoub could identify John Geste, and they
could bring him along ... bring the whole lot along, if
Yacoub got knocked out.... I should never be suspected....
It isn't that.... I simply don't want any killing, and I'll
try everything else first.</p>

<p>"... As to the treachery, that's the only alternative to
fighting and that's why I'm considering it...."</p>

<p>"Suppose the French ever find you out?" I asked.</p>

<p>"They're going to find me out, Son.... Out of the
country ..." was the reply. "It's like this, Boy.... John
Geste came back to save us.... I'm going to save John
Geste.... I'm going to do it without hurting a man, if I
can, and that means I've got to play false since I won't
play rough.... Well ... I've taken their money and I've
given them good value and a fair deal....</p>

<p>"Now here endeth the good value and the fair
deal&mdash;so I take no more money.... I throw in my
hand.... I'm a Bad Man all-right, Oats, but I've never
double-crossed and I won't start now.... The day I break my
side of the contract, the contract's broken, and I won't
benefit by it any more.... I've kept the Treaty that I made
with my young brother-in-law, good and proper, but it's
got to lapse directly I start monkeying-about with French
troops and actin' against French interests.... I'm sorry
I've got to do it at all ... <i>an' I wouldn't do it for any
living soul</i>, except for John Geste an' you two...."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Noel," I said. "I see.... Any trick to get John
away ... and it's your first and last 'treachery.'..."</p>

<p>"That's it, Son.... We don't bite the hand that feeds
us, or rather we only bite it once&mdash;and that much
against our will...."</p>

<p>"And you two will give up everything to save John
Geste?"</p>

<p>Noel looked at Buddy.</p>

<p>"Why, sure," said the little man, nodding at my
brother.</p>

<p>And turning to me, he added:</p>

<p>"It's all a matter o' what he calls his Bo Ideel...."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>We talked "about it and about," until my brother
said:</p>

<p>"Now we'll hear Marbruk ben Hassan and Yussuf Latif ibn
Dawad Fetata on the subject."</p>

<p>The loud clapping of the Emir's big hands brought a
slave running, and he was despatched for the two Arabs.</p>

<p>Marbruk ben Hassan, the deformed, but very
powerful-looking, dwarf, heard, apparently without the
very faintest shadow of surprise, that the Emir intended
to seize a convict of one of the French road-making
parties. And, in reply to his master's inquiry as to how
he would set about it, were he in charge of the business,
replied:</p>

<p>"A swift rush, just before dawn, when sentries are
sleeping and all men are at their weakest.... Crawl
close.... Three volleys ... and a swift charge pushed well
home...."</p>

<p>"And suppose no man on either side is to be killed, on
peril of your life; O, Marbruk ben Hassan?" inquired the
Emir.</p>

<p>"I am only a soldier, Lord," smiled Marbruk ben Hassan,
and fingered his beard.</p>

<p>"A soldier who leads soldiers should have a brain and
use it; O, Marbruk ben Hassan," replied the Emir.</p>

<p>Marbruk scratched his right calf with his left foot and
reminded me of a discomfortable school-boy.</p>

<p>The other Arab eyed him with a look of affectionate
tolerance.</p>

<p>"Taking a hundred men, I would make three parties," said
the dwarf at length. "Two strong, and one weak.... The two
strong parties, each making a détour, should, at sunset,
as the men cease work and go to camp, suddenly charge
each other, meeting at a spot quite near.... There should
be much firing, shouting, falling from camels, a <i>lab el
baroda</i>, a powder-play ... but looking and sounding like a
great fight.... There would be an alarm.... The guard would
come running and form up in that direction, and while all
was in confusion and nothing clear, the small third party
should swoop down upon the prisoners and ride off with the
man whose life the <i>Sidi</i> desires.... Word could be got to
him of what was toward...."</p>

<p>"Thou art not <i>wholly</i> a fool, O, Marbruk ben Hassan,"
smiled the Emir. And the Arab acknowledged the compliment
with a low salaam.</p>

<p>"Yussuf Latif?" said the Emir, turning to the other, a
lean large-eyed tragic-looking man.</p>

<p>"If guile is to be used and not the sword, I would
try France's own pacific penetration," he said. "Open a
little market ... dates ... <i>sharbet</i> ... fruit ... cooked
meats.... Also a band of holy dervishes would arrive and
rest.... There might be one or two slave women from the
tribe yonder....</p>

<p>"One day, at a given signal, a strong man springs on
every soldier, while another snatches his rifle.... A small
party at once liberates the prisoner and takes him to
where two or three of the fleetest camels are waiting, and
swiftly they ride hither...."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;afterwards&mdash;what of those who have
seized the guard?..." asked the Emir.</p>

<p>"It will be their privilege to die, Emir.... All will
volunteer ... nay, quarrel, for that honour...."</p>

<p>"None are to die, Yussuf Latif ... neither in fight not
in willing surrender of their lives ..." said the Emir.</p>

<p>"Speak again; O, Yussuf Latif...."</p>

<p>"What of this then, Lord? When our peaceful and humble
disposition has disarmed suspicion, and we have gradually
been permitted to mingle with the soldiers of the escort,
every one of these shall be allotted to two of our strong
men.... Of every two men, one shall have two stout thin
cords about his waist, or otherwise hidden....</p>

<p>"At the given signal, every soldier shall be seized
by the two appointed to him, and the moment that one has
snatched his rifle, the other shall seize him round the
arms and body.... The rifle-snatcher shall then bind the
man's feet together and his arms to his sides.... The two
shall then carry the man to an appointed place, where all
the soldiers shall be laid together unhurt.... Except
one....</p>

<p>"This one shall be laid a mile away&mdash;his feet most
strongly bound and one arm bound to his body tightly.... It
shall be shown to him that there is a knife stuck in the
sand, afar off....</p>

<p>"When we have departed&mdash;taking with us the man whom
you desire&mdash;this bound soldier will roll and wriggle
toward the knife, and by the time he gets it and contrives
to free himself and his comrades, we shall be very far
away, and, making a détour, return hither...."</p>

<p>"Leaving a track for all men to see?" asked the Emir.</p>

<p>The Arab smiled at the joke.</p>

<p>"Nay, Lord," he said, "the détour would take us up the
stony Wadi el Tarish where a million camels would leave no
trace...."</p>

<p>"Do you like this plan; O, Yussuf?" inquired the
Emir.</p>

<p>"Each man thinks his own fleas are gazelles," quoted
Yussuf Latif ibn Fetata.</p>

<p>"And what do you think the prisoners will do, when the
guards are bound and you are gone?" asked the Emir.</p>

<p>The Arab smiled and put his hand to his throat.</p>

<p>"They must be bound too," he said.</p>

<p>The Emir stroked his beard thoughtfully and pondered
awhile.</p>

<p>"You have spoken well; O, Marbruk ben Hassan and Yussuf
ibn Fetata.... I will reveal my mind later.... Meantime,
each of you select two score of the best.... Yes, yes, I
know that all are best&mdash;but select the coolest and
steadiest.... Men who do not fire at shadows nor foam at
the mouth as they fight...."</p>

<p>The two withdrew, salaaming profoundly.</p>

<p>"A fine combination, those two," said Noel. "Cautious
age and daring youth.... And both stauncher than steel and
braver than lions...."</p>

<p>"I surely am sorry for that Yussuf Latif boy," observed
Buddy. "What's wrong with him is a broken heart.... I know
the symptoms&mdash;none better...."</p>

<p>"That's so, Bud," agreed Noel, and added:</p>

<p>"The wonder to me is that you ain't egsperienced
the symptoms of a broken neck&mdash;or a stretched one
anyhow...."</p>

<p>The smile of the Wazir combined pity, superiority and
contempt in exactly equal proportions.</p>

<p>"The point is, have you got a plan ... chatterbox?" he
said.</p>

<p>"I have," said the Emir, and he detailed it to us.</p>

<p>"It ain't perfect," he mused, "but it's the best we
can do.... It's funny without being vulgar.... It oughta
succeed.... An' there won't be any killing....</p>

<p>"The young woman would help us, all-right, Otis?" he
asked, turning to me.</p>

<p>"She certainly would," I assured him. "Only too glad to
bring me a day's march nearer home.... Or right home in a
day's march...."</p>

<p>"That's the scheme, then," concluded Noel. "... And
we'll bring it off to-morrow night.... I'll hate doing
it&mdash;but I'd hate any other plan worse.... And the
job's got to be done...." </p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="first">
In all the changing scenes of life, one of the several
that are indelibly printed on my mind, and which I shall
never forget, is that of the feast and entertainment,
given by the Emir el Hamel el Kebir, to the men of the
advance-party of those who were the pioneers on the Road
that was eventually to link the Great Oasis with Zaguig,
the uttermost outpost of the African Empire of France.</p>

<p>Having a deep personal interest in this Road, the Emir
el Hamel el Kebir had, with a considerable bodyguard,
come from where he was encamped, to see with his own eyes
something of the great Road's swift progress and to greet
the fore-runners of its makers.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>The feast was, of course, an Arab one.</p>

<p>Surrounded by cushion-strewn rugs, on a large palm-leaf
mat, slaves placed a shallow metal dish so vast as to
suggest a bath. In this, on a deep bed of rice, lay a mass
of lumps of meat, the flesh of kids, lambs, and I feared,
of a sucking camel-calf. A sea of rich thick gravy lapped
upon the shores of surrounding rice, with wavelets of
molten butter and oily yellow fat.</p>

<p>In the centre of the bath was a noble mound of heads
crowned with livers, intact and entire. Among the mass of
chops, cutlets, joints, scrags, legs, shoulders, saddles,
and nameless lumps of meat, were portions of the animals
not usually seen on Western dishes. These, however, could
be avoided by the prejudiced.</p>

<p>I noticed that the genuine Arabs present, were not
prejudiced. Around this dish we knelt, each upon one knee,
his right arm bared to the elbow, and, with the aid of our
good right hands, we filled our busy mouths, and ate ...
and ate ... and ate ...</p>

<p>And ate.</p>

<p>There were present, the Emir el Hamel el Kebir; his
Minister el Habibka el Wazir; a gloomy taciturn Sheikh,
dark of face and blue-black of hair and well-clipped beard,
a man supposed to be under a curse and also suffering
from the effects of a highly unwholesome love-potion
administered to him by a jealous wife&mdash;a potion
from which he would probably never recover, as the Emir,
indicating my morose and surly self, explained to the
French <i>Adjudant</i>; also Marbruk ben Hassan; Yussuf Latif
ibn Fetata; and some half a dozen leading Sheikhs of
the tribe to which the Emir belonged; and four or five
Frenchmen.</p>

<p>From time to time, the Emir would fish out a succulent
morsel and thrust it into the mouth of the guest of honour
on his right, <i>l'Adjudant</i> Lebaudy, a man who interested me
much. I had put him down as very true to type, a soldier
and nothing more, but a fine soldier, rugged as a rock,
hard as iron, and true as steel&mdash;a man of simple mind
and single purpose, untroubled by thoughts of why and
wherefore, of right and wrong, finding duty sufficient and
the order of a superior more important than the order of
the Universe....</p>

<p>And by no means stupid&mdash;in fact watchful, wary, and
fore-sighted, as we were to discover.</p>

<p>We ate in stark silence&mdash;as far as speech is
concerned that is&mdash;lest light converse offend our host
with indication that we were finding but light fare and
entertainment.... When we had finished, and not a stomach
could hold another grain of rice, we rose, indicated our
profound satisfaction by profound hiccoughs, went to the
door of the tent, wiped our greasy hands upon its flap, and
then held them forth while servants poured streams of water
upon them from long-necked vessels.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, other servants removed the depleted hip-bath,
and so re-arranged rugs and cushions that, when two of the
wall-curtains were rolled up to the tent roof, each man of
the company reclined with his back to a tent-wall and his
face to the star-lit night without.</p>

<p>The great guest-tent, in which we sat, was illumined
by a hanging lamp within, and the flames of a great fire
maintained at sufficient distance to cause no discomfort. A
few yards from us, between the tent and the fire, servants
laid palm-leaf mats, upon which they placed a rug.</p>

<p>Coffee was brought, glasses and clay cups upon a huge
brass tray, and, to do them signal honour, the Emir
himself, with his own hand, took glasses of coffee to his
European guests.</p>

<p>But <i>l'Adjudant</i> Lebaudy excused himself, and I caught
Buddy's eye as the <i>Adjudant's</i> deep voice, in very fair
Arabic, rumbled words to the effect that so enlightened and
understanding a man as the Emir would not wish him to drink
coffee&mdash;which disagreed with him&mdash;merely for
politeness' sake....</p>

<p>The Emir was obviously greatly concerned and somewhat
hurt.... Never in his two score years of desert experience
had he met a man who did not enjoy coffee, or with whom
coffee disagreed.... <i>Coffee!</i>... One of the choicest of
gifts that the Mercy and Munificence of Allah had placed at
the disposal of man....</p>

<p>Perhaps the <i>Sidi Adjudant</i> could not approve such poor
stuff as the Emir had to offer?...</p>

<p>Not at all, not at all, explained the Frenchman.
Doubtless there was none better than that of the Emir
in all Algeria, nay in all the Sahara from Kufara to
Timbuctu.... No, it was merely an affair of the digestion
and strict injunction of the <i>Medécin-Majeur</i> against the
drinking of coffee....</p>

<p>The Emir expressed deep sympathy and great
regret&mdash;the latter undeniably genuine.</p>

<p>However ... the failure of hospitality could be
rectified when the tea was brought.... That should be made
entirely to the taste of the principal guest.... Either
with or without <i>zatar</i>, which gives tea a scent and
flavour so beautiful (to those who like it); thick with
sugar ... the first cup rich with amber; the second with
lemon; and the third with mint....</p>

<p>But, lo and behold!&mdash;an astounding thing&mdash;a
shocking thing for any host to learn, the guest of the
evening could not take <i>tea</i> either.... Tea had the same
distressing effect upon his internal economy....</p>

<p>This time the Emir was indeed concerned.... Scarcely
could he believe his ears.... <i>Not take tea?</i> Tea of
ceremony!... <i>Tea</i>, without which no host could honour a
guest; no guest refuse without gravest discourtesy, nay,
intentional insult!...</p>

<p>The Emir smiled tolerantly. His guest was of course
jesting, as would be seen when the tea was brought....</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at least five men in the tent could scarcely
repress the sighs of relief they felt at the sight of
the other Frenchmen who sipped and sipped, gave up their
empty cups and twice accepted fresh ones.... Had they also
refused, our plot had been frustrated.</p>

<p>The senior officer's refusal had filled those five with
the fear that his continence had been pre-determined and
enjoined upon the others. I decided that the incident was
merely the outcome of his acquired or inborn mistrust of
taking from an Arab host, food or drink so highly flavoured
that the taste of a deleterious "foreign body" would be
concealed. Also that he had no actual suspicions and had
suggested none to his colleagues....</p>

<p>Turkish cigarettes followed coffee. Turkish cigarettes,
we learned, were also unacceptable to the digestion of
<i>l'Adjudant</i> Lebaudy!...</p>

<p>In a quiet gentle voice, the Emir inquired whether a
cigarette lighted and partly smoked by himself would be
likely to disagree with the digestion of <i>l'Adjudant</i>
Lebaudy.</p>

<p>"<i>Touche!</i>" smiled Lebaudy to himself, and hastened to
assure the Emir that if there were a cigarette in this
world that he could smoke and enjoy, it would be such a
one&mdash;but alas, tobacco was not for him....</p>

<p>Tea followed the cigarettes and, at last, the Emir
was brought to understand that the guest of the evening
actually <i>was</i> refusing ceremonial tea!</p>

<p>He swallowed the insult in a way which showed that he
could not be insulted. Mannerless conduct hurt none but the
person guilty of it. Gross discourtesy merely labels such a
one as grossly discourteous....</p>

<p>It was well acted, and the other Frenchmen hastened to
show the excellence of their manners, and drained their
cups&mdash;special white-ware cups for the European guests
only&mdash;at each of the three ceremonial drinkings.</p>

<p>As the third was ended and the cups collected, strains
of lively music burst from the adjoining tent, and out on
to the carpet floated a cloaked, mysterious form. Her cloak
being thrown aside, the lovely and enchanting figure of
the Angel of Death was revealed, and <i>l'Adjudant</i> Lebaudy
had evidently at length discovered a kind of hospitality
prohibited neither by his doctor nor by his digestion.</p>

<p>That is the picture I shall never forget&mdash;the
Death Angel dancing beneath the desert sky by the light
of a great fire, to the insistent sensuous music, the
soothing-maddening-monotonous strains of the tom-tom, the
<i>raita</i>, the <i>derboukha</i> and the flute.</p>

<p>At a respectful distance, in staring silence, sat
the soldiers of the Emir's Bodyguard, rapt, enthralled,
stirred, excited.</p>

<p>Apart from them, French soldiers off duty&mdash;all
indeed who were not actually on guard or sentry&mdash;also
sat and stared, entranced, enchanted.</p>

<p>Only those who have not seen a woman of their own sort
and kind, for years, can measure the meaning and appeal to
these men of, not merely a woman, but a singularly lovely
and bewitching woman, trained and experienced in every art
of fascination and allure.</p>

<p>And undeniably the Angel moved more like a winged being
from another sphere, than like a creature of flesh and
blood.</p>

<p>As the music abruptly ceased, and her dance finished,
there was a space of utter silence, followed by wild and
tumultuous applause, as the Angel retired to her tent,
wherein waited her negro women.</p>

<p>Before this tent sat Abd'allah ibn Moussa, guarding his
mistress during her visit to the Emir's camp, but in a
position from which he could watch me the while.</p>

<p>I fear that the next item on the programme, the singing
of frank love-songs by an Arab youth with a beautiful voice
and a remarkable repertoire, fell a little flat.</p>

<p>At its conclusion, the Emir gave orders for fresh
coffee to be brought to us, and that yet more refreshment
be served to the watching soldiers who had already been
regaled with <i>cous-cous</i>, mutton-stew, sweetmeats and
coffee.</p>

<p>Thereafter the Angel danced again, and her reappearance
galvanized into fresh life and renewed interest, the now
somewhat somnolent Europeans among the audience.</p>

<p>Again her performance was rapturously hailed and wildly
applauded.</p>

<p>During the succeeding turn&mdash;some exceedingly clever
juggling and conjuring&mdash;it was evident to a watchful
eye that several of the French soldiers had lain back where
they sat, as though overcome by sleep....</p>

<p>For the third time the Angel emerged from her tent and
danced, but, on this occasion, introduced a variation. From
her dancing-carpet she moved across to that around which we
sat cross-legged upon our cushions.</p>

<p>In this confined space she floated, whirling upon
tip-toe.</p>

<p>Lebaudy's eyes shone and his lips parted. The Frenchman
who sat on the Emir's other side, stared with a glazed and
drunken gaze, though drunken he was not. His colleague,
next but one upon his left, was frankly asleep. I watched
the other <i>sous-officier</i>, and saw that he was struggling
to keep awake&mdash;happy, drowsy, but desiring to see
some more of this vision of loveliness before he went to
sleep.</p>

<p>Next but one to him, the remaining <i>sous-officier</i> was
making an effort to keep awake, while his head nodded
abruptly at intervals, as his eyes closed and he relaxed
for a second or two.</p>

<p>I admired the foresight of the Emir, who had so arranged
his guests that they sat in a straight line to right and
left of him, with Lebaudy between himself and the Wazir.
Only by craning rudely forward, could Lebaudy see what was
happening to his subordinates, who, so far, had not given
way to snores as well as slumber. Furthermore, by no amount
of craning, could he see the spot where his soldiers sat
feasting eyes, ears, and stomachs.</p>

<p>Before <i>l'Adjudant</i> Lebaudy, the Angel paused, smiled
seductively, and hovered, dancing divinely with her arms
and body, while remaining stationary on the tiny spot
covered by the tips of her bare toes. Anon she turned
her back and bent right over until her face looked up
into his.... French <i>sous-officiers</i> do not carry gold
coins and place them upon the foreheads of appellant
dancing-girls&mdash;but kisses are another matter,
and, taking her face between his strong short-fingered
square-nailed hands, he kissed her ardently, and again,
with right good will.</p>

<p>With a ringing laugh, the Angel of Death swung her
lithe body erect, and began to do her utmost to fulfil her
name.</p>

<p>Before Lebaudy she danced, and with eyes for no-one
else&mdash;not even for the great Emir; and we sat
and watched a wonderful exhibition of purposeful
seduction&mdash;seduction, fascination and captivation.</p>

<p>And, as was her wont, the Angel succeeded in her task.
None watching the face of <i>l'Adjudant</i> Lebaudy could think
of the simile of the fascination of the rabbit by the
deadly serpent, but at least one watcher of this sinister
drama thought of Samson and Delilah.</p>

<p>Before my eyes, this brave strong man weakened and
deteriorated; ceased to be watchful, wary and alert; forgot
his duty and his whereabouts&mdash;forgot everything but
the woman before him, and succumbed.</p>

<p>Only two of the musicians had accompanied her to our
tent, one with a two-ended little drum which he played
with palm and finger-tips, the other with the <i>raita</i>, and
between them and the girl was complete understanding.</p>

<p>I have heard the world's greatest musicians interpret
the music of the world's greatest Masters, and I have been
greatly moved. But never in my life has European music,
rendered on European instruments, <i>affected</i> me, as did
that Arab music, played upon the <i>raita</i> and the drum.</p>

<p>Well do the Bedouin call the <i>raita</i>, the Voice of the
Devil, and I was but an onlooker, while Lebaudy was an
actor in this drama of two.</p>

<p>I do not know for how long the girl postured, danced,
beguiled, knelt beseechingly before him, sprang away ere
his hands clasped her, teased, maddened, promised&mdash;all
in gesture and dumb-show; but suddenly, after a quick
look at four sleeping Frenchmen, she glanced at the
Emir, flashing a message, 'I have done my best and can
do no more,' and floated backward from us, turned, and
disappeared into her tent.</p>

<p>As her intention of departing became obvious, Lebaudy,
still but semi-conscious of his surroundings, involuntarily
it seemed, rose on one knee as if to follow, remembered
where he was, and sank back, "sighing like a furnace."</p>

<p>But only for a moment.</p>

<p>Distracted as was his mind from affairs mundane,
he seemed suddenly to realize that he had seen
something&mdash;and heard nothing.</p>

<p>He had seen a colleague most unbelievably asleep, and he
had heard no applause.</p>

<p>Something was wrong....</p>

<p>His trained military instinct of the approach of danger
was awakened and, shaking off the last vestiges of the
spell, he arose briskly to his feet, with a peremptory,</p>

<p>"Come along! Time we turned in!"&mdash;and realized that
his four colleagues were all most soundly sleeping.</p>

<p>"<i>What's this?</i>" he shouted, half alarmed, half
incredulous, and, striding across his left-hand neighbour,
he nudged the nearest sleeper with his foot.</p>

<p>To speak more exactly, he fetched him a remarkably sound
kick.</p>

<p>"Get up, you swine," he growled in French.</p>

<p>Receiving no response, he knelt swiftly, seized the
man's collar, shook him so violently that his head rolled
to and fro&mdash;and realized the state of affairs.</p>

<p>In that instant all alarm and bewilderment left him.
He became as cold and hard as ice, and won my warm
admiration.</p>

<p>Without haste or agitation, he coolly raised an eye-lid
of the sleeping man, and gave a brief hard bark of
disgust.</p>

<p>"<i>Drugged!</i>..." he growled in French, and glanced at the
other sleepers, the only men now not upon their feet.</p>

<p>The raised tent-walls were lowered from without, and the
<i>Adjudant</i> Lebaudy stood in a closed tent, and a circle of
armed Arabs.</p>

<p>His hand went swiftly to a pocket, and ere he withdrew
it with another short snort of disgust, I heard a voice
whisper beside me. And the whisper was:</p>

<p>"It hath went before, Bo!"</p>

<p>As a guest, the <i>Adjudant</i> had worn no weapons, but he
had certainly carried one, and the Wazir, his attentive
host, had picked his pocket.</p>

<p>He was a brave man, this Lebaudy.</p>

<p>"Well, noble and honourable host," he said, with a
bitter smile, and, with a swift change from sarcasm,
added,</p>

<p>"What's the game, you dog? You treacherous slinking
jackal.... What now?... Do you hope for the pleasure of
hearing me bawl for help&mdash;to my poisoned men?...
What's the game, I say?...."</p>

<p>"One that I play with the utmost distaste, with the
deepest regret, and with the profoundest apologies,"
replied the Emir.... "A game, I may add, in which you
have made the wrong move ... from my point of view, that
is...."</p>

<p>"Huh!... I was to be poisoned too, <i>hein</i>?... But I am
too old a fox to be tricked by a mangy jackal...."</p>

<p>"No, no, <i>Sidi Adjudant</i>.... Not poisoned!... No-one
has been poisoned.... You were to have been our honoured
guest&mdash;for the night&mdash;like these other gentlemen
who sleep where they dine...."</p>

<p>"And while I slept?" snapped Lebaudy. "All our throats
cut? Rifles and property stolen?... More '<i>Touareg</i>' work,
<i>hein</i>?..."</p>

<p>"No, no, again, <i>Sidi Adjudant</i>," the Emir declared
"Not a throat.... Not a rifle.... Not a <i>mitka</i> worth of
property.... It was something wholly worthless that I
propose to take&mdash;a convict...."</p>

<p>"Indeed!... You interest me ..." sneered Lebaudy. "And
might one venture to inquire which convict you kindly
propose to liberate, and why?... He must have some very
wealthy friends....</p>

<p>"And the sentries ... and the guard...?" he continued.
"To be stabbed in the back ... treacherously rushed at
dawn?..."</p>

<p>"Not a stab ... Not a shot ..." the Emir assured him....
"One or two of my Chiefs who speak French&mdash;sufficient
for the purpose&mdash;were going to borrow, with many
apologies, uniforms from a sleeping Sergeant and
Corporal.... Half a dozen others, again with many
apologies, uniforms from your excellent soldiers, now
sleeping so soundly, as you rightly assume.... Everything
would have been returned safe and sound and, in the
morning, my dear <i>Adjudant</i>, we should all have awakened
together, merry and bright, in the very places where we
laid us down to sleep.... And by-and-bye you would have
discovered that a prisoner was missing&mdash;and none
so surprised as your simple Arab hosts, on learning the
fact!... <i>Voilà tout</i>...."</p>

<p>As the Emir spoke, the <i>Adjudant</i> nodded his head from
time to time, a thin and tight-lipped smile distorting his
face.</p>

<p>"And now?" he asked briefly.</p>

<p>"Ah ... <i>now</i> ... my dear <i>Adjudant</i> ..." silkily
replied the Emir, "... things are different.... You have
been so wise ... so cautious ... so careful of your
digestion ... that you have changed my plans.... The
'game,' as you call it, will be a different one, and you
will play the leading part in it...."</p>

<p>"Again you interest me," sneered Lebaudy. "I might
almost say you surprise me.... <i>I</i> shall play a leading
part, <i>hein</i>? And pray what might that be?..."</p>

<p>"Listen, my dear <i>Adjudant</i>, and listen
carefully&mdash;lest France have cause to mourn
your loss.... You will lead a small party of <i>my</i>
people&mdash;dressed in the uniforms of <i>yours</i>....
You will&mdash;er&mdash;'make the rounds,' do you call
it?&mdash;reassuring each of your sentries with the
countersign and the sight of your countenance, to which you
will raise a hand-lamp.</p>

<p>"You will then proceed to the tents of the convicts, and
will release the one indicated by the man who will go with
you in the uniform of a Corporal, and who will hold a knife
within an inch of your back the whole time.... That convict
you will bring here.... I and my followers will at once
depart with him ... and we shall do ourselves the honour of
inviting you to accompany us...."</p>

<p>"And if I refuse?"</p>

<p>"You will accompany us all the same, my dear
<i>Adjudant</i>...."</p>

<p>"I mean if I refuse to have anything whatsoever to do
with your infernal rascality?... To Hell with your sacred
'games.'... Are you a mad dog as well as a treacherous
one?..."</p>

<p>"At least I am not mad, <i>mon Adjudant</i>," replied the
Emir.</p>

<p>"But <i>you</i> are ... if you refuse.... On the one hand,
merely a convict the less&mdash;and <i>you</i> know how easily
<i>they</i> can die, be shovelled into the sand, and struck off
your roll.... On the other hand, the loss to France of a
brave, resourceful, and, I am sure, valued officer...."</p>

<p>"Murder, <i>hein</i>?" remarked Lebaudy.</p>

<p>"And worse I fear," confessed the Emir sadly.</p>

<p>"Torture?"</p>

<p>"Alas!" admitted the Emir.</p>

<p>"And what becomes of <i>you</i>, my friend?" sneered Lebaudy.
"Are you not forgetting such trifles as the French
Republic, the French army.... How long will <i>you</i> live, you
treacherous rat, after this?..."</p>

<p>"Mourn not for me, <i>Sidi Adjudant</i>," besought the Emir.
"One thing at a time, and first things first.... Listen
again, I beg&mdash;it is for the last time.... One of
your prisoners is going to be liberated <i>now</i>, by me....
It will be done more quickly and more easily with your
help and presence, but done it <i>will</i> be.... Give us that
help, and I give you my word, a word I have never broken,
that you shall be set free&mdash;unhurt.... And not only
unhurt, my friend, but rewarded.... As you remarked, the
convict has wealthy friends&mdash;and I am one of them....
What do you say to fifty thousand francs?... A fortune....
Would you care to leave the desert, to retire to your home
in France?... Beautiful France.... And sit beneath the
shadow of your own vine and your own fig-tree, a wealthy
man.... And no harm done, mark you.... No betrayal....
No treachery.... No selling of the secrets of France....
Just an act of mercy to an innocent man.... What do you
say, <i>Sidi Adjudant</i>?... What do you say to fifty thousand
francs?..."</p>

<p>Profoundest silence in the tent.</p>

<p>Not one of the watchful circle of armed men made sound
or movement. All seemed even to hold their breath as they
awaited the Frenchman's answer.</p>

<p>"I say <i>nothing</i> to them," he shouted. "I spit on
them.... And on you.... Now, you dog&mdash;lay a hand on
me as I go to leave this tent, and you have assaulted a
soldier of France&mdash;obstructed him in the execution of
his duty.... Already you have bribed and threatened him....
<i>You</i>, calling yourself an ally of the Republic.... <i>You</i>,
who have made a Treaty with France.... <i>You</i>, who have
taken French gold and would use it to bribe a servant of
France ... and if I live, I will command the firing-party
that shall shoot you like the dog you are...."</p>

<p>"And if you die?..." asked the Emir.</p>

<p>"Then with a French rope will you be hanged by another
servant of France...."</p>

<p>And upon my soul, I almost whooped "Hear, hear!"</p>

<p>The man was fine, as he stood there surrounded by his
enemies, stood firm&mdash;wealth on the one hand, and
torture on the other.</p>

<p>I felt sorry for Noel, for I knew how he must loathe the
part he had to play, and I could not but admire the way in
which he played it.</p>

<p>"Believe me, <i>Sidi Adjudant</i>, nothing but the sternest
necessity could drive me to do this&mdash;to offer a bribe
of gold or a threat of torture and death, to a soldier of
France...."</p>

<p>"Not to mention a guest, I suppose," observed the
<i>Adjudant</i>. "... An invited guest.... The world-famous Arab
hospitality!..."</p>

<p>"Indeed if anything could further blacken my face and
make more evil and distasteful my deed, it would be that
fact ..." admitted the Emir with sincerity. "By the Beard
of the Prophet, and the Ninety and Nine Sacred Names of
Allah, I loathe what I have to do.... Come, come!... It
is but a little thing I ask.... Just the life of one of
those wretched prisoners.... And let me whisper to you, a
Frenchman, a man of sensibility.... <i>There is a lady in
the case ... a beautiful woman ... a sweet and lovely lady
whose heart is breaking....</i>"</p>

<p>I thought for a moment that Lebaudy wavered
then&mdash;but he yawned, tapped his mouth once or twice
with his open hand, and with a formal:</p>

<p>"It grows late.... I thank you for your hospitality,
Emir.... You must excuse me ..." he turned to go.</p>

<p>Noel, Buddy and I seized him&mdash;and I for one, hated
the job&mdash;and the others drew their knives.</p>

<p>"Ah!..." said Lebaudy.</p>

<p>And:</p>

<p>"Forgive me," said the Emir, and took him in a huge
embrace as Marbruk ben Hassan, swiftly stooping, bound the
Frenchman's feet together.</p>

<p>"<i>Sidi Adjudant</i>," said the Emir, "I detest doing
this ... more than I can say.... Is there any hope for a
<i>parole</i>?... Give me your word to make no effort to escape,
and I will not have you bound.... Nor shall you be gagged
... Nor blindfolded when we shoot you....</p>

<p>"Help us to treat you well.... To torture you, to make
you aid me, would sadden me for a year.... To kill you, to
shut your mouth, would sadden me for a lifetime...."</p>

<p>Noel released his grip.</p>

<p>The Frenchman drew back his clenched fist to strike,
and his arms were instantly seized by Buddy, and pinioned
behind him. "Carry him to the small tent," said the Emir,
and the order was quickly obeyed.</p>

<p>Lebaudy made no resistance, but, the moment he was
outside the large pavilion, he gave vent to the most
tremendous shout I have ever heard from human lungs....</p>

<p>"<i>À moi!... À moi!...</i>" he bawled.</p>

<p>And the sound of his voice was enough to awaken the
dead.</p>

<p>Marbruk ben Hassan and Yussuf Latif simultaneously drew
their knives, and put the points of them to the Frenchman's
throat and heart respectively.</p>

<p>"Another sound and you die," growled the Wazir.</p>

<p>"<i>Garde</i> ..." roared Lebaudy instantly. And the hand of
the Emir was clapped over his mouth.</p>

<p>"Into the tent with him, quick," he said. "The sentries
may have heard him...."</p>

<p>And in a moment, the brave Lebaudy was hustled into the
tent.</p>

<p>"The uniforms!... Marbruk, Yussuf, and the rest of you
... Quick...." And all left the tent save my brother, Buddy
and myself.</p>

<p>"Now then," he continued, addressing the <i>Adjudant</i>,
and his voice and manner changed. "You saw that fire out
there.... Suppose you were bound to a pole and fed into it,
feet first?..."</p>

<p>"Then I should hardly be able to make the rounds with
you, if I wanted to.... Even your intelligence might follow
that...." was the reply.</p>

<p>"Of course.... How foolish of me.... Thank you ..."
replied the Emir. "We shall need your feet, as you say....
But we could lead a <i>blind</i> man, of course.... Or another
idea.... We have ten minutes to spare while my men are
dressing in the uniforms of yours.... Suppose we take off a
finger a minute until you change your mind?..."</p>

<p>"A bright idea!... Guards and sentries are quite
accustomed to seeing their commanding officer approach with
both hands streaming blood!..." sneered Lebaudy.</p>

<p>"Well then, suppose we agree that you are incorruptible
and immovable! Also that as you insist on spoiling our
plans and thwarting our modest desire to take but one
convict, we are going to give ourselves the satisfaction
and compensation of torturing you to death as painfully as
we know how...."</p>

<p>"That is as you please," replied Lebaudy, "but I shall
only get for a few minutes what you will get for all
Eternity, you foul dog."</p>

<p>"No, no, <i>Sidi Adjudant</i>! The removal of an Infidel is
an act of merit on the part of a True Believer...."</p>

<p>It occurred to me to feel glad that Lebaudy, whom my
brother, of course, had no intention of injuring, much less
of killing, had no suspicion that the Emir was other than
he seemed. It would be a terrible blow to Mary should her
husband's great drama be discovered to be farce.</p>

<p>"We shall know more about that later," growled the
Frenchman. "What is not in doubt, is the question of your
fate when my countrymen catch you...."</p>

<p>"We shall know more about that later," smiled the
Emir. "Meantime your fate takes precedence, <i>Sidi
Adjudant</i>&mdash;and I will be generous.... For, in spite of
your recalcitrance, and the trouble and annoyance you have
given me, I will let you choose.... Shall it be the fire,
feet first ... Impalement on the sharpened trunk of a young
palm ... Or pegged out for the vultures?..."</p>

<p>The <i>Adjudant</i> shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It's a matter of complete indifference to me," he
yawned.</p>

<p>And before my brother could reply, Yussuf pulled aside
the curtain at the entrance to the tent.</p>

<p>"One came running," he said quickly, "a soldier.... He
heard the cry of this officer.... We have bound him.... He
is unhurt."</p>

<p>"He may have saved your life," remarked the Emir,
turning to the <i>Adjudant</i>. "Perhaps he will help us in the
little play-acting and give us the countersign, in return
for his life."</p>

<p>"If he is one of my <i>légionnaires</i>, you will get nothing
out of him," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Well, hope for the best, <i>Sidi Adjudant</i>.... If the man
is amenable, I will not torture you.... Perhaps even I will
not kill you...."</p>

<p>The Emir then bade Yussuf bring four men and order them,
on peril of their lives, to guard the French officer and
see that none held communication with him.</p>

<p>He then led the way to my tent, where Marbruk ben
Hassan awaited us with a bundle of French <i>képis</i>, coats,
trousers, leggings, boots, side-arms and equipment.</p>

<p>In a surprisingly few minutes I was a French
Sergeant, dark and bearded, it is true&mdash;but then
the night was dark, and many of the soldiers were
bearded&mdash;inspecting a guard consisting of a Corporal
and eight men.</p>

<p>"Now then," said Noel, "... the captive. No need for him
to see me, but he's got to see this guard.... You'll talk
French to him, of course, Otis.... Also let him see, from
not too near, the dead bodies of his slumbering comrades
and of the <i>sous-officiers</i> in the pavilion.... Tell him
his top-sergeant is elsewhere, tortured to death....
That was his dying yell he heard.... If he's only too
glad to get his own back on the <i>Adjudant</i>, by helping,
all's well.... If he's staunch, try fright, bribery and
corruption."</p>

<p>"Suppose he double-crosses ... gives us the wrong
countersign, and lets a yell when we get into the convict
camp...." said Buddy.</p>

<p>"Well, we've got to take a chance," replied Noel. "It's
up to you to be right in judging your man.... He may jump
at the chance of gaining a few hundred francs and his
liberty, especially if Lebaudy is as popular as he used to
be...."</p>

<p>"<i>Used to be?</i>" I said.</p>

<p>"Yes.... Used to be ... when Buddy and I were in his
<i>peloton</i>...."</p>

<p>"He surely was some nigger-driver," confirmed Buddy.</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>... When?..." I said. "What <i>are</i> you talking
about?"</p>

<p>"When we were in the Legion, Son.... You've heard the
great tale of the Relief of Zinderneuf, where Beau Geste
was killed, and we started out with John Geste and his
other brother, and tramped the desert for two years....
Well, old Lebaudy was Sergeant of our <i>peloton</i>, under our
smart-Alec brother-in-law.... Lord, yes.... Lebaudy is a
great old friend of ours!"</p>

<p>"Only he's another that don't know it ..." said Buddy,
and added:</p>

<p>"It surely hath been a pleasure to twist his tail this
night.... He's give us many a unhappy night, an' I allow
we've give <i>him</i> one, now...."</p>

<p>I said nothing but thought much.</p>

<p>In the best Legion manner, I stepped back, rasped a
"<i>Garde à vous! Par files de quatre. En avant!... Marche!</i>"
and the drilled men of the body-guard, to whom none of this
was new except their unaccustomed uniforms, moved smartly
beneath the ferocious eye of the Corporal-Wazir.</p>

<p>We had not marched more than a few yards before I
cried:</p>

<p>"<i>Halte!</i>"</p>

<p>I had had an idea, and turned back to the Emir's tent.
Noel was reclining on his rugs, looking thoughtful and
somewhat dejected.</p>

<p>"Son," he said, "I don't like it.... I can't sit here
in safety and let you go into that camp.... If they pinch
you, you'll never be seen again.... Nor Bud either....
The Legion wants him&mdash;just like the Zephyrs want
you...."</p>

<p>"I'm going anyhow, Noel," I said, "whether you go or
not.... It's my privilege and my right.... I found him, old
chap, and I'm going to save him.... It's you who are saving
him really, but I mean&mdash;I must be there&mdash;and take
the lead too...."</p>

<p>"True, Son ... but I don't like it.... For two pins I'd
come along, as one of your men.... But I mustn't be caught
and be found to be an American from the Legion&mdash;for
Mary's sake.... And for the sake of my Arabs too.... I hate
letting Bud go without me.... But I can't let you go alone
with the men, and Bud insists because John came back to
look for <i>him</i>!..."</p>

<p>"What did you return for?" he added.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;I had an idea..."</p>

<p>"<i>No!</i>" said my brother, in feigned surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've been thinking."</p>

<p>"You aren't here to think, Son.... You're here to obey
orders, you know.... You go and collect the ideas of that
man they've caught...."</p>

<p>"What occurred to me," I continued unmoved, "... was
this ... I'm every inch a French Sergeant.... Suppose we
put this disguised squad on their camels, and we make a
little détour.... Then I ride in here again, at their
head, and with some more of your body-guard behind us as
<i>goumiers</i>. We ride in where this prisoner is, and he would
at once see, with his own eyes, that we are a perfectly
good French <i>peloton méhariste</i>. He'll shout for help, and
you'll look guilty and confused.... I'll be haughty and
truculent, and moreover I'll refuse to camp with you....
I'll have the man set free, and tell him to lead us into
the convict camp. I'll take command, in the inexplicable
absence of Lebaudy and the <i>sous-officiers</i>, voice my
suspicions that something is wrong, visit the sentries and
tell them to be watchful.... Count the convicts&mdash;and
bring one away with me to this camp.... With a good nerve
and a little luck, that ought to work perfectly...."</p>

<p>Noel smote his thigh.</p>

<p>"Oats," he declared, "you've said something.... Go and
fetch Buddy...."</p>

<p>I bade my squad&mdash;or <i>troupe</i>&mdash;"Stand easy!"
and, in Arabic, told the Wazir that the Emir would fain
have speech with him.</p>

<p>In the tent I repeated and elaborated my plan. It
appealed to Buddy at once, and he preferred it to the other
scheme on account of the human factor.</p>

<p>That was uncertain in both, but less so, perhaps,
in my scheme. A bribed and intimidated man might well
double-cross us&mdash;fearing the French authority more
than us, and doubting whether he would ever get his thirty
pieces of silver. He would probably agree to all that we
suggested and then betray us&mdash;instead of his own
people&mdash;as soon as we were well into their camp, and
he in safety.</p>

<p>In a very few minutes my proposal was carried
unanimously, the more readily in that none of us was at all
enamoured of the debauching of a simple soldier from his
duty, if it could be avoided.</p>

<p>"It looks water-tight to me," decided Noel. "So far, the
prisoner has neither heard nor seen anything suspicious in
this camp. All he knows is that they thought they heard
Lebaudy shout.... The Corporal of the Guard, or someone,
sent him down to see if anything was wanted, and he was
seized and held as he came running into this camp...."</p>

<p>"Quite right too," observed Corporal Buddy, with some
indignation. "... Rushing into a respectable camp like this
in the middle of the night.... Barging about like a steer
at a rodeo.... <i>Course</i> he were arrested...."</p>

<p>"Send a man for Marbruk ben Hassan," said Noel.</p>

<p>Buddy stepped out of the tent and, a few minutes later,
Marbruk entered with him.</p>

<p>On being questioned by the Emir, it turned out that, as
we hoped and supposed, the prisoner had been seized by the
guard at the very entrance to the camp, had been put in the
guard-tent, and could know absolutely nothing of what had
occurred.</p>

<p>All seemed propitious for the success of my plan, and
Marbruk was sent back with certain instructions to the
guard&mdash;one of which was, to place the prisoner where
he could see anyone who went by.</p>

<p>Marbruk was then to get my uniformed squad of
hard-bitten dependable ruffians mounted, and to have them,
with a dozen others in Arab dress, awaiting me at the
opposite side of the camp.</p>

<p>Men and camels were of course drilled and experienced
members of the Emir's body-guard, picked from his famous
Camel-Corps.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"Good-bye, Son, and may God help you," said Noel, as
I left the tent. "Keep cool, and act up to me and Bud,
and we'll have John Geste here in an hour.... Now, don't
forget.... You're an indignant and suspicious French
Sergeant.... And you don't hold with Arabs as such.... You
don't use language <i>too</i> frequent and free, to me, because
I'm a Big Noise, and the French Government's very fond
of me.... Still, you don't like having French soldiers
arrested by Arabs, and you want to know all about it....
Play up, Son.... We'll get away with it...."</p>

<p>His farewell to Buddy was less impressive, for, as that
Corporal-Wazir turned on his heel without a word, the
Emir's sandalled foot shot up and encountered ill-fitting
French trousers.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Yussuf Latif ibn Fetata, in French uniform, stood at
the head of my kneeling camel, his foot upon its doubled
fore-leg to prevent its rising to its feet. He saluted as I
approached and handed me the rein-cord.</p>

<p>I mounted, the camel rose, and I rode away from the
camp, followed by my mixed <i>peloton méhariste</i>.</p>

<p>The night was dark and very still, and, at that
hour&mdash;about three o'clock in the morning&mdash;<i>I</i>
would willingly have been dark and very still, upon the
comfortable rug and cushions of my tent....</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>A quarter of an hour later, I approached the tents of
the quarter-guard, and, as we drew near, the Soudanese
sentry challenged and brought his rifle from the slope to
the ready. I replied with a loud hail and the announcement
that we were friends, come in peace.</p>

<p>The sentry turned and shouted, and from the guard-tent a
powerful, mis-shapen dwarf came hurrying with a well-tended
slush-lamp in his hand.</p>

<p>The guard turned out in fine style.</p>

<p>"<i>Franzawi!</i>" cried the dwarf, in great surprise. "Come
in peace.... By Allah, is it well?"</p>

<p>"A <i>peloton méhariste Français</i>!" I cried. "What camp is
this?"</p>

<p>"The camp of His Highness the Emir, Sidi el Hamel el
Kebir, Leader of the Confederation of the Tribes of the
Great Oasis...."</p>

<p>"Sir!" cried an indignant voice in French from the
guard-tent. "I have been arrested by these Arabs.... Been
taken prisoner, I have!..."</p>

<p>And a man in uniform struggled from the tent, closely
followed by two Soudanese.</p>

<p>"Here! What's this?" I shouted, my voice hard with
wrathful surprise. "A French soldier in uniform? By
whose order was he arrested? Where's he from?... Send my
compliments to the Emir....</p>

<p>"Come here, you," I called to the man. "Tell me about
it.... I'll look into this...."</p>

<p>And with gentle taps of my camel-stick upon its neck, I
brought my camel to its knees.</p>

<p>The light from the slush-lamp fell upon my face and upon
that of the French prisoner.</p>

<p>"<i>Hankinson!</i>" he cried, using the name which had been
mine in the Legion.</p>

<p>"<i>Sergeant</i> Hankinson, please!" I replied instantly,
with stem reproof in my voice. "Have you gone blind,
<i>Légionnaire</i> Schnell?..." And I brought into prominence
the gold stripe on my cuff.</p>

<p>Yes.... I had been quick!... For once I had risen to the
occasion with absolute promptitude and <i>aplomb</i>. And, by so
doing, I had turned a ghastly contretemps into what might
prove a piece of amazing good luck.</p>

<p>It was the miserable Schnell, the butt and buffoon of
my barrack-room in the Legion, and, in another second,
I should learn whether he had heard that I had been
court-martialled and sent to the Zephyrs. It was extremely
improbable, as he had gone from Sidi-bel-Abbès to Senegal
when I had gone to the Moroccan border.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I beg your pardon, <i>Monsieur le
Sergent</i>," gasped Schnell, saluting repeatedly. "I knew
your voice and I recognized your face, and I called your
name without stopping to look.... I am very sorry, <i>mon
Sergent</i>."</p>

<p>All was well. The miserable Schnell had heard
nothing.</p>

<p>"That's enough! Don't chatter like a demented parrot....
Tell me how you come to be here.... And where the end of
the Road is.... That is what I was looking for...."</p>

<p>"Oh, close here, <i>mon Sergent</i>," replied Schnell,
standing stiffly to attention. "It's like this, sir.... The
convict camp is just back there and this Arab&mdash;he's a
big Chief, a 'friendly'&mdash;he gave a <i>fête</i>, a feast,
and dancing-girls and all that, and invited the Commandant
and <i>messieurs les sous-officiers</i>, and all men who were
off duty.... I was on guard, and me and Schantz and
Slinsky and Poggi were sitting outside the guard-tent,
when suddenly Corporal Blanchard said, 'Silence, you!...
Hark!'</p>

<p>"And we listened, but we heard nothing, and the Corporal
said he thought he had heard the voice of <i>Monsieur
l'Adjudant</i> Lebaudy. They say he has the biggest voice in
the French Army...."</p>

<p>"Oh, for God's sake," I growled, "cut it short.... And
tell me what you are doing here.... You mean you assaulted
some harmless Arab I suppose.... Or was it one of their
women?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir! No, no, no!" protested poor Schnell. "Corporal
Blanchard said he thought he must be mistaken, but said
I'd better come across and see whether everything was
all-right.... And they arrested me...."</p>

<p>"I suppose you came rushing into the camp like a Touareg
... like a whole Touareg raid, a host in yourself ..." I
sneered.</p>

<p>"The Corporal said 'Run across,' sir, and I came <i>au pas
gymnastique</i> and ..."</p>

<p>"Silence!" I roared. "Don't you back-answer me, you
jibbering jackass.... How long have you been here?"</p>

<p>"About half an hour, sir," admitted Schnell.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll have you put somewhere else, for about
half a month," I bullied. "You blundering half-witted ...
half-baked ... half-bred ... half-addled ... half-man
you...."</p>

<p>I was, I fear, beginning thoroughly to enjoy myself.
Probably I was uplifted by excitement, hope, fear and
tautened nerves. I then turned upon the dwarf.</p>

<p>"And you?" I stormed in Arabic. "How dare you arrest
a French soldier on his way to speak with his commanding
officer?"</p>

<p>The dwarf spread deprecating hands and shrugged
tremendous shoulders.</p>

<p>"By Allah! A mistake ... an accident.... Such fools
as these Soudanese are.... But the <i>Roumi</i> soldier came
running, and was violent.... His Highness the Emir will be
distressed beyond words.... But the man was <i>very</i> violent.
Some say he slew two with his bayonet ... others say
three...."</p>

<p>"What!" I cried, "absurd!... Was the man drunk then?"</p>

<p>"Well, <i>Sidi, this</i> one was not very drunk," replied the
dwarf.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I cried. "Let your speech be
plain.... 'This one was not very drunk.'... Who <i>was</i> very
drunk then?..."</p>

<p>A quiet and orderly body of men, several carrying lamps,
approached.</p>

<p>The dwarf was flustered.</p>

<p>"Our Lord, the Emir himself," he whispered.</p>

<p>And at the head of a body of Sheikhs, officers,
officials, soldiers, and slaves, appeared the Emir el Hamel
el Kebir.</p>

<p>"Please Allah! Well?... Come in peace!... The Peace of
Allah be upon you!"</p>

<p>I saluted the Emir, military fashion.</p>

<p>"Health and the Peace of Allah upon you, O Emir!... <i>Le
Sergent Hankinson, peloton méhariste, numero douze</i>, for
Number One Construction Camp.... I saw your fire and came
to ask.... In your camp I find a French soldier arrested
and detained.... I have to request that you hand him over
to me at once, with explanation...."</p>

<p>"What is this, Marbruk ben Hassan?" inquired the Emir of
the dwarf. His voice was harsh.</p>

<p>Marbruk, with low salaam, hastily repeated what he had
said to me.</p>

<p>It appeared that the man had been very violent ... some
said five had been killed ... or gravely injured.... The
dwarf feared that the man had been under the influence of
the strong <i>sharab</i> of the <i>Roumis</i>.... Fighting drunk, in
fact....</p>

<p>Indignantly Schnell denied that he had so much as seen
liquor, for years.</p>

<p>"But how <i>could</i> he be drunk?" I interposed angrily.
"Where would he get it? Do the wells then contain <i>sharab</i>
in this part of the desert?"</p>

<p>The Emir smiled and stroked his beard.</p>

<p>"Nay, I never thought so," replied the Emir. "Until this
day I had not thought it.... Strange indeed are the ways of
the <i>Roumis</i>&mdash;but let us thank Allah for the diversity
of His creatures.... Verily wine is a mocker ... and well
is it prohibited unto us...."</p>

<p>"What is behind your speech, O Emir?" I asked. "Give me
not twisted words from a crooked tongue, I beseech you. Let
our speech be short and plain."</p>

<p>"Will the Commandant come with me a moment?" asked the
Emir with quiet dignity. "And if perhaps he would bring
this soldier who has seen no <i>sharab</i>...."</p>

<p>"Corporal!" I shouted over my shoulder. "Let the men
dismount and take an 'easy.' Each man to stand to his camel
with rifle unslung."</p>

<p>And Corporal Buddy's salute and reply were the authentic
thing. It would have taken a quicker brain than Schnell's
to have found anything wrong with me and my <i>peloton</i>.</p>

<p>As I moved off with the Emir, followed by Schnell, the
former remarked confidentially, but with care that Schnell
should hear him:</p>

<p>"I did not wish to say too much in front of your men,
Commandant.... And also I thought you would believe your
own eyes more quickly than my voice...." Bidding his
followers to halt and to await him where they stood, the
Emir led me and Schnell to a tent.</p>

<p>"I regret this most deeply," he said, "... and I would
fain have concealed it.... I gave a poor feast in my humble
camp and invited all who cared to come.... It is not for
me to make comment.... But my men are accused of arresting
one who knows nothing of any drunkenness, any imbibing
of <i>sharab</i> ..." and he pulled aside the curtain of the
tent.</p>

<p>By the light of the lamp in the tent, we beheld the
distressing spectacle of three uniformed non-commissioned
officers, deep sunk in drunken slumber.</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders and clucked my tongue in
disgust.</p>

<p>"Tch! Tch! Tch!... And what of their men?" I asked,
shamefaced and angry.</p>

<p>It was the turn of the Emir to shrug his shoulders.</p>

<p>I stirred one of the sleepers sharply with my foot, and
shook the other by the shoulder (but not too violently).</p>

<p>"And the <i>Adjudant</i> Lebaudy?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Do not ask me, <i>Monsieur le Sergent</i>," said the Emir
pityingly.</p>

<p>"Where is he?... I will see him.... I must satisfy
myself...." I said sharply.</p>

<p>"<i>Légionnaire</i> Schnell," I added. "Remain in here until
I return.... Leave this tent at your peril."</p>

<p>The Emir led me away. </p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="first">
I returned and entered the tent, grave-faced, sad,
indignant, but with the look, in my eye, of a good Sergeant
who sees promotion in the near distance.</p>

<p>"Schnell," I said, "listen, and be careful.... A still
tongue runs in a wise head.... Get you back at once to
camp, and report to Corporal Blanchard that all's well
here ... <i>all's well</i>, d'you understand?... <i>Monsieur
l'Adjudant</i> Lebaudy did not call for you.... He and the
Sergeants are remaining longer.... <i>Remaining longer</i>,
d'you understand?... Be very careful what you say....
I should be sorry for you if it were found that false
reports&mdash;detrimental to <i>l'Adjudant</i> Lebaudy and your
superior officers&mdash;were traced to you...."</p>

<p>The good Schnell apparently understood very clearly.</p>

<p>"Very good.... Get along back then and ... oh ... report
that a <i>peloton méhariste</i>&mdash;Sergeant, Corporal, eight
soldiers and ten <i>goumiers</i>&mdash;is arriving at once.
Tell Corporal Blanchard to warn the sentries.... I may as
well have the countersign too.... What is it, '<i>Maroc</i>'
still?..."</p>

<p>"No, sir, '<i>Boulanger</i>,'" replied simple Simon
Schnell.</p>

<p>"Well, be off then ... and don't run like a mad bull
into your own camp.... Get a bullet in your belly one of
these days...."</p>

<p>Schnell saluted and departed with speed, filled with the
best intentions.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"Now for it!" I said, as we hurried forth to rejoin my
circus of camels and performing Arabs.</p>

<p>"Great stuff! Son, you're The Goods!" whispered Noel, as
he gripped my arm....</p>

<p>I gave the order to mount, and, a minute later, I led
the <i>peloton</i>, in column of files, at a swinging trot
toward the convict camp.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Anxiously as I was awaiting it, the sentry's loud:</p>

<p>"<i>Halte!... Qui va là?</i>" brought my heart into my
mouth.</p>

<p>I switched my mind from thoughts of John and
Isobel&mdash;and became a French Sergeant again.</p>

<p>I answered, and gave the countersign in correct
style&mdash;the style with which I was only too
familiar&mdash;halted my <i>peloton</i>, and went forward.</p>

<p>"That you, Schantz?" I snapped.</p>

<p>"No, Sergeant," replied the man. "I am Broselli...."</p>

<p>"Has Schnell just come into camp?" I asked.</p>

<p>"A few minutes ago, Sergeant," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Ah!" I said mysteriously, called my <i>peloton</i> to
attention, and led them to the camp.</p>

<p>"<i>Halte!</i>" I cried at the top of my voice. "Dismount!...
Stand easy!"</p>

<p>The guard turned out, the Corporal came hurrying,
followed by a man bearing a lamp.</p>

<p>He saluted me smartly.</p>

<p>"Urgent and in haste," I said. "Take me to <i>l'Adjudant</i>
Lebaudy, at once."</p>

<p>"He's over at the big Emir's camp, Sergeant," replied
the Corporal. "A <i>fête</i> ... a big show.... Everybody's
there...."</p>

<p>"So I gathered," I said grimly. "A little awkward
if there was another raid, hein? However, that's the
<i>Adjudant's</i> affair.... You in command here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sergeant.... I am senior Corporal," replied the
man.</p>

<p>"Well, you'll do," I said. "They want that man back, in
Zaguig.... The convict who says he was the only item not
on the last Touareg butcher's-bill.... They seem to think,
now, it wasn't a Touareg show at all...."</p>

<p>"What! The convicts themselves?"</p>

<p>"No, fat-head.... They wouldn't all have killed
themselves, would they?"... and I leant over and lowered my
voice confidentially. "<i>Selim ben Yussuf!...</i> And his tribe
one of the Allied Confederation and all!... Yes, that's the
latest idea.... It was he handed the man back, y'know....
And there's about a dozen not accounted for.... Smart bit
of bluff, what!"</p>

<p>"He hasn't a cold in the eyes, that one," opined the
Corporal.</p>

<p>"No," I said. "Come on ... I can't stop chattering here
all night.... You know the man, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Well ... not to say <i>know</i> him, Sergeant.... I daresay
I can ..."</p>

<p>"All-right," I answered. "I know his ugly mug
well enough.... I had charge of him at the Zaguig
Court-martial.... We shall be old friends by the time they
<i>do</i> make him squeal...."</p>

<p>I turned to Buddy.</p>

<p>"Corporal," I snapped. "We shall be off again in a few
minutes.... Where's that spare camel? You'll be in charge
of it.... Tie the man's hands behind him, and the end of
the cord to your wrist.... The men will mount again in five
minutes....</p>

<p>"Come on, Corporal Blanchard," I added. "That damned
Court-martial sits to-morrow."</p>

<p>And, preceded by the man with the hand-lamp, we marched
off, my heart beating like a trip-hammer.</p>

<p>Apparently this worthy soul was more observant than his
Corporal, for if he did not know the desperado by sight or
by number, he knew which tent he was in.</p>

<p>With a murmured, "<i>Tente numero B7</i>," he led us straight
to one of the tents.</p>

<p>"The bird's in here, Corporal," he said, as the sentry
came to attention.</p>

<p>"Fetch him out then," said Corporal Blanchard.</p>

<p>"And be quick about it," I snapped.</p>

<p>There were rustlings and growlings within, the kind of
sound of movement one might hear on stirring up a cageful
of straw-couched feral beasts, at night.</p>

<p>Two minutes later, the man with the lamp reappeared with
the sentry&mdash;and <i>John Geste ... John Geste!</i>... ill,
and broken and worn, but still firm of lip and grim of
jaw.</p>

<p>It was an anxious second....</p>

<p>Just kicked from slumber and flung out into the night,
face to face with me, would he cry my name aloud in his
incredulous surprise?... If he did, I would take the same
line that I had taken with Schnell, but with greater
sternness.</p>

<p>I might have known!... I need not have feared.... "<i>Bon
chat chasse de race.</i>"... Blood tells....</p>

<p>John gave me a quick look, and then stood with the surly
hang-dog convict slouch, his eyes on the ground.</p>

<p>"Here, you, put that lamp to his ugly mug.... I don't
want to take the wrong man," I snarled, giving him what cue
I could, and putting my hand beneath his chin, I rudely
jerked his head up.</p>

<p>"That's the swine," I said. "Take him along and sling
him on the spare camel."</p>

<p>And we marched off.</p>

<p>Buddy's reception of the prisoner was not calculated to
raise suspicion in the slow mind of Corporal Blanchard.</p>

<p>With a business-like contemptuous roughness, he pinioned
the prisoner. And with a brief:</p>

<p>"<i>Voilà!</i> Undo that if you can!" he pointed with a
jerk of his thumb to the spare camel, now attached to his
own.</p>

<p>"Get on, and enjoy your last ride in this world," he
growled, "and if you so much as <i>look</i> crooked, I'll drag
you behind it...."</p>

<p>"Well, good-night, Corporal," I said to the excellent
Blanchard, and mounted my camel, every second expecting
that the man's detestable voice, with a tinge of respectful
surprise, would utter the words for which I had been
waiting from the first.</p>

<p>"<i>What about the warrant, Sergeant? You haven't handed
it over.</i>" Had he demanded it, as, of course, he should
have done, it had been my intention to say:</p>

<p>"Ah, yes! Of course!"&mdash;to feel for it in my inner
pocket, and&mdash;slowly, reluctantly, with growing horror,
consternation, and alarm&mdash;to come to the conclusion
that I had actually left it at Zaguig! I imagined Blanchard
hastening to reassure his superior officer, and disclaim
the slightest desire to embarrass him.... The warrant could
be sent out with the next ration-party....</p>

<p>In that case I would nod my agreement and offer to
scribble him a receipt for the goods, as his authority
meanwhile.</p>

<p>As I gave the order to march, another idea occurred to
me, should he yet remember and yell for the warrant. I
would say stuffily:</p>

<p>"Warrant! <i>You?...</i> How long have <i>you</i> been
<i>l'Adjudant</i> Lebaudy? I think I'll hand it to him, thank
you ..." (very sarcastically).</p>

<p>But the fool never thought of it at all, God bless him!
"<i>Walk ... march ...</i>" I intoned.</p>

<p>The camels shuffled forward, the sentry saluted, and ...
<i>John Geste was free</i>. </p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p> During the short ride between the two camps, I kept
silence and stared straight ahead into the night.</p>

<p>I could not have spoken without disgracing myself. A
choking held my throat, a smarting blinded my eyes, an
acute pain stabbed my heart, and I trembled from head to
foot.</p>

<p>Nor did I hear a word pass between Buddy and John Geste,
close behind me.</p>

<p>I think that both, like me, had hearts too full for
speech, and that John was being wary&mdash;riding, as it
seemed to him, among French soldiers.</p>

<p>By our own guard-tent, I halted and dismissed the
<i>peloton</i>, the admirable small-part characters of my
caste, who hastened away to return their "properties" to
their rightful owners. It would not be seemly that any
good French soldier should awake to find his trousers
missing.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>One on each side of John, we marched to the Emir's tent,
entered it, closed the opening and stood together&mdash;an
Emir, a French Sergeant, a French Corporal and a
convict!</p>

<p>Three Americans and an Englishman!</p>

<p>Shall I attempt to describe that meeting?... Tell
of how John cleared his throat with a slight cough and
remarked:</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully, you fellows.... These cords are very
tight.... Anybody got a drink on him?..."&mdash;and
collapsed in a dead faint.</p>

<p>... Of how we worked over him and brought him round,
Buddy weeping freely and swearing fiercely ... my brother,
in grim silence, save when he blew his nose violently ... I
swallowing, and swallowing, and swallowing, while words of
fire capered about my aching brain.</p>

<p>"<i>John Geste is free ... John Geste is saved ... Isobel
... Isobel ... Isobel ...</i>"</p>

<p>Of how, in silence, John Geste put his left hand on my
shoulder and with his right gripped mine with what strength
he had left to him....</p>

<p>Of how he did the same with Hank, saying nothing....</p>

<p>Of how he did the same with Buddy, saying nothing....</p>

<p>Of how we four men, stirred to our deepest depths,
as perhaps never before in our lives, tried to behave
as reticent white men should, with decent repression of
emotion ... though Buddy was once or twice shaken from head
to foot by a spasm&mdash;followed by a torrent of shocking
profanity ... though Hank was constrained to blow his nose
with a violence that shook the camp and caused Buddy to
request him not to wake the Seven Blasted Sleepers ...
though John Geste, from time to time, uttered the slight
cough with which he covered what would, in a woman, have
been a sob ... and I, I could not see properly.... </p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p> There was a cry without.</p>

<p>The Emir sprang to the tent-door, and we heard the voice
of Marbruk ben Hassan.</p>

<p>"Lord, <i>a raid on the French camp at dawn</i>!...
Yacoub-who-goes-without-water hath sent in a rider....
Yacoub had news of a big <i>harka</i> encamped, and went
thither.... He heard the talk around the camp-fires....
They are not Touareg. It is Selim ben Yussuf and his
band&mdash;disguised as Touareg.... He knows his tribe
moved north as ordered.... With an overwhelming rush
they will stamp flat the convict camp, shouting Touareg
war-cries lest any escape the slaughter and tell the
tale.... Having slaughtered the guard and convicts, he will
loot what he can of rifles, ammunition and stores. And
having made another big détour will join the tribe near
Bouzen...."</p>

<p>"Man proposeth but Allah disposeth," said the Emir.
"Bring me the messenger...." and turned back into the tent
where Buddy and I were swiftly resuming our Arab dress.</p>

<p>Noel quickly selected <i>jubba</i>, <i>kaftan</i>, <i>kaffieh</i>,
<i>burnous</i> and head-cloth from his own stock of clothing,
and John, tearing off his ragged convict dress, assumed
them with speed and ease.</p>

<p>I remembered that he had worn Arab dress for a couple of
years.</p>

<p>Had it ever been hidden from me, the secret of my
brother's rise would now have been revealed. He thought
of everything.... He ordered everything.... He foresaw
everything.... He was cool, unhurried, supremely efficient,
and the policy with which he handled the <i>Adjudant</i> Lebaudy
was masterly....</p>

<p>Yussuf Latif ibn Fetata came to the tent.</p>

<p>"The French soldiers are again arrayed in their
uniforms, save two," and he glanced at the uniforms
discarded by Buddy and myself.</p>

<p>"Go like the wind, good Yussuf," said the Emir, "and
array those two also.... Take note that this bundle belongs
to the man lying with three others in the big tent...."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>The messenger arrived in custody of Marbruk ben Hassan,
and added but little to the latter's précis of his
message.</p>

<p>We gathered, however, that Selim was counting on the
Emir's being encamped ten miles off, or else on his way
back to the Great Oasis, and not only unable to assist the
French, but also unable to enhance their admiration and
approval of his good-will and good ability in the matter of
guaranteeing peace in the desert, and the policing of the
new route.</p>

<p>To the Touareg the blame; to the Emir the discredit of
inefficiency; to Selim ben Yussuf the loot, and revenge on
the hated <i>Franzawi</i>....</p>

<p>And as, with beneficent and approving smile, the Emir
gave the messenger permission to retire, that ragged wisp
of humanity smiled crookedly, displaying his tooth, and
with profound obeisance added:</p>

<p>"Also Yacoub bade thy slave tell the Sidi Emir, that the
attack will be made from the Zaguig side, as danger would
be least expected thence. It will doubly fail because not
only will the <i>Franzawi</i> be now expecting it, but Yacoub
will himself ride behind the rear of Selim ben Yussuf's
<i>harka</i>, and as they are about to charge, he will fire his
rifle in the air."</p>

<p>"And be himself destroyed by the French volleys?" asked
the Emir.</p>

<p>"Nay, Lord, he will be lying flat upon his back behind a
sand-dune and his kneeling camel."</p>

<p>The Emir smiled and the messenger departed.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>The Emir issued further orders.</p>

<p>"Marbruk ben Hassan," said he. "I need not give thee
detailed instructions. A line of men behind a ridge across
the Zaguig Road.... Camels twenty yards to the rear....
Orders to section leaders for ten rounds of rapid fire when
Yacoub's rifle goes off, or your whistle blows.... Pickets
far out, all round the camp.... Send out Yussuf Latif with
a swift patrol, with Yacoub's messenger as guide.... Not a
shot to be fired on peril of their lives.... We want to be
'surprised'&mdash;at fifty yards...."</p>

<p>Marbruk ben Hassan, the happy light of battle on his
soldierly face, departed, and the Emir turned back into the
tent.</p>

<p>"Here's a pretty kettle of fish!" said he. "Bud, set
R'Orab and all the servants to chucking water on that fire,
and then on the drunks.... See there isn't a light in the
camp.... You try and fetch the Sergeants round.... You come
with me, Oats.... John, you lie low.... Go to bed, in fact,
on those cushions...."</p>

<p>John shook his head.</p>

<p>"Can't you find me a rifle?" he asked.</p>

<p>"On to that bed with you, Boy.... I do most solemnly
swear that I'll bind you hand and foot, if there's another
word out of you ..." and he strode from the tent.</p>

<p>As we hurried to the small one in which Lebaudy must
have been having one of the worst hours of his life, Noel
remarked:</p>

<p>"If I see Selim ben Yussuf over the sights of my rifle,
doing the early bird, this morning, it'll be more worms
than early bird for his...."</p>

<p>The four men in charge of Lebaudy were ordered to report
to Marbruk ben Hassan immediately.</p>

<p>"<i>Sidi Commandant</i>," said the Emir, "no man can
withstand his fate.... To some, good fortune; to some,
bad.... What is written is written.... Your camp will be
attacked at dawn...."</p>

<p>"By <i>your</i> orders, you treacherous devil, of course....
I quite expected it," was the reply. "Huh! The faith of the
Arab!... The noble untamed unsullied Son of the Desert,
whose word is better than his bond!... you pariah cur!...
Now we know who made the <i>last</i> raid!..."</p>

<p>"I think we do, <i>Sidi Commandant</i>&mdash;one Selim ben
Yussuf.... It is he who will attack now...."</p>

<p>"By <i>your</i> orders," sneered the <i>Adjudant</i>. "Do you
take me for a fool&mdash;an Afflicted-of-Allah?... By your
orders, of course.... I, in your power, bound hand and
foot.... Three-quarters of my men decoyed here and poisoned
... and my camp 'will be attacked at dawn.'... I've no
doubt it will, you devil, you treacherous hound ... you
lousy, begging, lying oasis-thief.... Attacked at dawn,
<i>hein</i>?... In other words, when you've cut the throats of
everyone of us here, you and your foul gang of murderous
ruffians will visit my camp with knives and pistols in your
sleeves, and make a massacre&mdash;to avoid a fight!...
That'll be your 'attack.'... My soldiers shot in the back
... stabbed in the back ... butchered.... More '<i>Touareg</i>'
work, <i>hein</i>?... Dead men tell no tales, <i>hein</i>?... And
all that you may earn some gold for rescuing some rich
criminal....</p>

<p>"But you hear my last words, and remember them....
The arm of France is long.... You'll hang.... You'll
hang&mdash;at the end of a rope, in Zaguig gaol...."</p>

<p>"Are those the <i>Sidi Commandant's</i> last words?...
Because, if so, I would fain lift up my own poor voice and
utter one or two ..." replied the Emir.</p>

<p>"Listen.... I have received information from my spies,
that Selim ben Yussuf will attack your camp at dawn....
A sudden swift raid from the Zaguig side.... His object
revenge&mdash;he does not greatly love the French, as you
know&mdash;loot, rifles and sport....</p>

<p>"As you have shown me, that would wipe out this
night's work, for me, nicely.... I have but to saddle-up
and go, with all my men&mdash;and the convict whom
I wanted&mdash;and all record of my (shall I say?)
impropriety of conduct, will vanish, even as will the
aforesaid convict...."</p>

<p>"<i>Lies!... Lies!...</i>" roared Lebaudy. "<i>Lies....</i> You
father of treachery and son of filth.... <i>Words....</i>"</p>

<p>"Words <i>and</i> deeds, <i>Sidi Commandant</i> ..." interrupted
the Emir. "Time flies ..." and he drew a great knife which,
with its gold-inlaid hilt, worn upright in the middle of
his sash, marked his rank.</p>

<p>"<i>Deeds!</i>" sneered the undaunted Lebaudy. "Worthy
deeds!... Cut my throat, you Arab hero ..." and throwing
back his head, he closed his eyes.</p>

<p>My brother cut the cord that bound Lebaudy's feet, and
set him free. Lebaudy stared incredulous.</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i> what's the game?" he growled.</p>

<p>"The game, <i>Sidi Commandant</i>, is this.... You jump on
to a swift camel and ride with us&mdash;you to your camp
to make those dispositions which will mark you as a second
Napoleon&mdash;I to my men who are by now ambushed across
the line of the Road from Zaguig to your camp, awaiting the
attack which will come within the hour....</p>

<p>"Meantime the very utmost will be done to revive your
sleeping men, and to send them over, on camels, to your
camp...."</p>

<p>"Are you speaking the truth?" incredulously asked the
astonished Lebaudy.</p>

<p>"Ride with me straight to where my men are protecting
your camp," said the Emir.</p>

<p>"I will," replied the Frenchman grimly. "I shall be able
to make my dispositions better when I have seen yours," he
continued. "Not that I believe a word of it.... But I am
in your power for the moment, and must play your game, I
suppose...."</p>

<p>"It would be wiser, <i>Sidi Commandant</i>," said my brother,
helping the <i>Adjudant</i> to his feet.</p>

<p>"I will put my few men in, to stiffen your line ... if
there <i>is</i> a line," growled the latter.</p>

<p>"It will need no stiffening, <i>Sidi Adjudant</i>," smiled
the Emir. "Might I respectfully suggest they be used as a
mobile reserve under your command ... reconnaissance ...
pickets ... scouts ... or even to cut off such retreat as
will be left to friend Selim ben Yussuf...."</p>

<p>"Seeing's believing ..." growled the <i>Adjudant</i>. "I'll
make my own arrangements, thank you.... And defend my own
camp...."</p>

<p>"Not with three men and a boy," smiled the Emir. "I'm
going to fight Selim ben Yussuf when he attacks your camp,
and you can help me as you like."</p>

<p>"Come on then," snapped the <i>Adjudant</i>, half-convinced.
"If you are speaking the truth, they may come at any minute
now...."</p>

<p>"Arrangements have been made for their reception," said
the Emir, and led the way to where the camels awaited
us.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>As we passed, I thrust my head into the Emir's tent,
where John lay at rest upon the rugs.</p>

<p>He was awake.</p>

<p>"Look here, John&mdash;orders are that you don't leave
this tent till we come back.... That'll be all-right, won't
it?... Then I can push off with Noel and help save the
French camp.... He's hopping mad that that young swine,
Selim, should have gone on the war-path like this.... And
on the one and only night when the French can't look after
themselves&mdash;thanks to Noel himself!"</p>

<p>"Why, no, Vanbrugh, I'm not going to sit here, if Hank
and Buddy are going out scrapping ... I'm coming too....</p>

<p>"Didn't I come out to Africa <i>to save those two</i>?" he
laughed, "and now I've <i>saved them</i>, do you expect me to
let them out of my sight&mdash;scrapping around in the dark
and all?"</p>

<p>I grinned at this John Geste.</p>

<p>"Well, and didn't <i>I</i> come out to Africa to save <i>you</i>?"
I asked. "And now I've saved you, do you expect me to let
you out of my sight&mdash;scrapping around in the dark and
all?"</p>

<p>"Better go together then," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it.... I must go and back my brother up,
and you must have the decency to remember that it's cost
us all no end of time and trouble to put you where you
are&mdash;and you've got to stay put."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, of course," replied John Geste, "if you
put it like that.... All I can say is&mdash;what I said
before ..." and here he laughed out-right, "we'll go
together...."</p>

<p>And we went together&mdash;a pair of perfectly good
Arabs following their Emir. </p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p> A short ride brought us to where we were challenged by
one of Marbruk ben Hassan's vedettes, and, a few minutes
later, we were being led by Marbruk himself, along the line
of his ambush-defence.</p>

<p>If Yacoub's information were correct, and Selim and his
raiders were going to attack in this direction, it would
probably be Selim's last exploit, and the end of his career
of treachery to the French.</p>

<p>The wily and experienced Marbruk had proceeded
sufficiently far from the camp to be at a spot where
the raiders would still be riding in a crowd. A little
nearer to the camp, and they would have spread out into a
line&mdash;a line that would have outflanked Marbruk's, and
soon become a circle completely enveloping the camp.</p>

<p>Already a scout, mounted on a fine Arab horse, had
ridden in with information which entirely corroborated that
of Yacoub&mdash;a <i>harka</i> some two to three hundred strong,
had ridden toward the line of the Zaguig-Great Oasis Road,
and, turning half-right, had swung on to it.</p>

<p>Having seen this, the scout had galloped back at
once.</p>

<p><i>Adjudant</i> Lebaudy grunted, and, with a guide, rode hard
for his camp.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>A quarter of an hour later, as I sat beside John, behind
the ridge&mdash;possibly the most triumphantly happy person
in the world&mdash;and wished the wretched Selim would
hurry up, for I was very cold,&mdash;a rifle cracked.</p>

<p>I scrambled to the top of the ridge and looked over.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said John. "What do you put that at&mdash;five
hundred yards?"</p>

<p>"Or nearer," I said. "Now Noel will let them know that
they don't surprise the camp, whatever else they do....
Nasty four-o'clock-in-the-morning shock for Selim...."</p>

<p>A whistle blew near-by. A few minutes later a couple of
short blasts were blown, and a crashing volley was fired
from a distant section of the ridge.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously, other volleys followed from
other sections, and then the ceaseless banging of rapid
independent fire from a hundred rifles.</p>

<p>A pandemonium of noise broke out from what had been
the silent mysterious space in front of us ... a noise to
which wounded men and camels contributed, as well as every
subordinate leader who had anything to shout&mdash;their
cries varying in portent from charge to flight. Some I
believe did one, and some the other, for I certainly saw
vague blotches of white receding, while vague forms loomed
up quite near.</p>

<p>A whistle blew loudly, a long strong blast, and all
firing ceased. It blew again twice, and volley upon volley
banged clean and crisp. The fire-control was astonishingly
good.</p>

<p>The whistle blew again. From our front a few rifles
cracked irregularly, and what other sounds could be heard
indicated the retreat of our assailants.</p>

<p>"Got a bellyful, as well as a nasty shock!" observed
John, as he jerked the empty shell out of his rifle.</p>

<p>"Hullo! There's a side-show," he added, as brisk firing
broke out on our left-rear.</p>

<p>Evidently Noel had issued orders, for a section of men,
running down the slope, mounted their camels and rode off,
followed by myself and John.</p>

<p>Flashes were coming from distant sand-dunes on our
left-front. The camel-section was halted in line, the men
dismounted, and, a couple of minutes later, were enfilading
the crest of the occupied sand-dune.</p>

<p>Undrilled, undisciplined and without any but
mob-tactics, this body of raiders, who may have been
an independent private effort, or a feint by Selim ben
Yussuf, retired in a body to another sand-dune, offering an
admirable target in the growing light, as they did so.</p>

<p>Commanded by Lebaudy in person, a small French party
pursued in skirmishing order&mdash;there was always a
number dashing forward and there was always a number
firing&mdash;and drove them across our front.</p>

<p>As they retreated toward the main body, and in fact,
finally fled in that direction, our line swung half-right,
prolonging Lebaudy's line until both prolonged that of the
Emir, and the whole advanced in skirmishing order from both
flanks.</p>

<p>The Emir's aim and object was not, of course, slaughter,
nor even the most severe and crushing defeat that could be
inflicted upon Selim ben Yussuf. What he wanted to do was
to defeat this attack, and in such a way that there would
be no fear of its repetition until the French were in a
position to deal with it themselves. Selim ben Yussuf's
plan had most signally failed, thanks to the presence
of the Emir's forces; the raiders were on the run, and
the Emir's Camel Corps would keep them on the run. By
the time the latter called a halt and returned to their
camp, Lebaudy's force would be in a position&mdash;and a
condition&mdash;to deal with any subsequent trouble.</p>

<p>As our line skirmished forward, a long low hill that lay
at right-angles to the battle line, cut off Lebaudy's flank
from our view. This long low hill, or high ridge, was about
a mile in length and a half-section of our men advanced
along it's narrow top. Suddenly one of these went running
back to where his camel knelt, while another signalled
"Enemy in sight," in spite of the fact that there was a
retreating enemy in sight of all of us, in one direction or
another. The signaller's meaning was made clear, however,
when the messenger arrived at a lumbering gallop, and told
his tale. Riding to where the Emir sat on his gigantic
white camel, on top of a sand-dune, he told how there had
been a sudden lightning raid, a veritable hawk-swoop, on
the left flank of the line. A band of picked fighting-men
mounted on the finest camels, and led by Selim ben Yussuf
himself, had made a détour, and had approached unseen, by
riding up a deep wadi and between high sand-dunes. They had
approached sufficiently near the French flank to launch a
charge and drive it home with terrific impact, before the
flank-section could be swung back into line to meet them.
The enemy, using shock-tactics, had broken and scattered
Lebaudy's men, and, by the time Marbruk ben Hassan had got
the flank-section of the Camel Corps in position to protect
his flank and prevent the line from being rolled up, the
raiders had wheeled about and fled.</p>

<p>"Fled?" said the Emir. "Then why all this chatter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, fled," said the messenger, and added deprecatingly
and as though he were to blame&mdash;for every Oriental
loathes to be the bearer of bad tidings&mdash;"They have
taken the French officer with them."</p>

<p>Selim ben Yussuf had captured Lebaudy! The Emir raised
himself in the saddle and looked behind him.</p>

<p>"Horse," he shouted in a voice that would have done
credit to Lebaudy himself, and waved a beckoning arm.
Within a minute, his standard-bearer was beside him, and
sprang from the back of the magnificent stallion that was
the Emir's favourite.</p>

<p>"Oats," he said to me, as he sprang into the saddle,
"find Buddy quick, and tell him I am chasing Selim, who's
got Lebaudy. Tell him to follow with Yussuf Latif's
section. He'll get his direction from the men on that
ridge," and he bade the messenger ride back to the hill-top
and watch. As he finished speaking, the Emir dashed off
like a racing Centaur.</p>

<p>While I watched him go, I was struck by the disquieting
thought that, riding at that pace in pursuit of camels, he
would very soon overtake them. A camel will always beat
a horse in the long-run, but not in the short. The speed
is with the horse and endurance with the camel. To me it
appeared inevitable that my brother would overtake Selim
ben Yussuf and his cut-throats, long before he had the
support of the section that was to follow him....</p>

<p>I quickly found Buddy, in command of the right flank
of our line, and following on his camel, with critical
eye, the orderly and regular advance of his dismounted
skirmishers. I shouted the news to him and, as he shook his
camel into movement and wheeled off, he shouted:</p>

<p>"S'pose the old fool thinks he is going to hunt 'em
about with a stick!... Chase after him, Son.... I'll
be along in two minutes.... Wish we'd got some more
horses...." </p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="first">
As I turned to go, I discovered that John had
disappeared, and guessed that he was already trailing
Noel. Urging my camel to its top speed&mdash;an undeniable
canter&mdash;I took the straightest line for what I
supposed to be the scene of the coming conflict. This took
me across the ridge from which the messenger had come. From
this eminence I could see, in the clear morning light, the
fleeing band of camel-riders, a galloping horseman quickly
over-taking them, and a solitary rider urging his camel in
pursuit&mdash;Selim ben Yussuf and his raiders, my brother,
and John Geste.</p>

<p>Careering in break-neck fashion down the slope of the
ridge, I saw much of what then happened, and learned the
remainder later from John and my brother. </p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p> At the head of the fleeing raiders, rode Selim ben
Yussuf on his famous horse. Its speed was restrained to
that of the camels. By him, on a giant camel, also famous
in that part of the desert, rode his cousin, one Haroun el
Ghulam Mahommed, behind whom the unfortunate <i>Adjudant</i>
Lebaudy hung across the camel like a sack of potatoes, his
arms bound to his sides and his feet tied together&mdash;a
most undignified, painful, and dangerous situation. In a
close group round this camel, rode the remaining dozen or
so of Selim's selected ruffians, some of whom found time in
the lightness of their hearts and the heaviness of their
hatred, to award the unfortunate <i>Adjudant</i> a resounding
blow with a <i>mish'ab</i> camel-stick, or a violent prod with
the butt end of a spear. Suddenly, one of the raiders,
hearing the drumming of a horse's hoofs behind him, looked
over his shoulder and then shouted to his leader.</p>

<p>Selim ben Yussuf looked round, saw, and understood.</p>

<p>Wheeling out from his position in front of the camels,
he shouted "<i>Ride on</i>," and, lowering his spear-point,
charged head-long at the Emir.</p>

<p>Had the latter also carried a lance, the beholders
would have seen a tournament like that of the knights of
old&mdash;a combat belonging rather to the days of Saladin
and Richard Coeur de Lion, the days of chivalry, when
foemen met in single combat, man to man, horse to horse,
and spear-point to spear-point. The Emir, however, carried
only the Arab sword which he always wore, and an automatic
pistol in a holster attached to the sword-belt which he
wore round the sash beneath his <i>burnous</i>....</p>

<p>Almost in the moment of impact, the Emir, a most
perfect and powerful horseman, checked his horse, pulled
it back on to its haunches and wheeled it from the line of
attack&mdash;so deftly, so exactly, and so absolutely at
the right second, that not only did the lance-point merely
tear his wind-blown <i>burnous</i>, but the furious charge of
his assailant missed him completely.</p>

<p>He drew his sword, but not his automatic, and spurred
his horse at Selim as the latter was wheeling about, to
return to the attack. It was too late for the Arab to
attempt to charge, for the horse and man were upon him,
and he could only lower his spear-point, that his charging
opponent might impale himself upon it. The Emir's sword
flashed down with tremendous force, and the deflected
lance&mdash;either cut through or broken&mdash;was dashed
from Selim's hand. Again checking and swerving his horse,
the Emir wheeled away and gave Selim ben Yussuf time to
draw his sword. Had he unslung the rifle from his back, the
Emir would have shot him.</p>

<p>Selim spurred his horse and, rising in his stirrups,
delivered a downward cut at the Emir's head. The Emir
parried, feinted like lightning, and, in his turn, aimed
a downward stroke at the head of Selim. Selim parried,
but a downward blow from the mighty arm of the huge
Emir, delivered with all his strength as he stood in his
stirrups, was a different thing from a stroke delivered by
the slight but wiry Arab.</p>

<p>It was parried correctly enough, but Selim's sword was
struck from his hand as though by a thunderbolt, and the
Emir's weapon smote him a heavy glancing blow that caused
him to reel in the saddle. Instantly the Emir, dropping his
sword, grappled the Arab in his great hands, dragged him
from his saddle, dropped him to the ground and fell heavily
upon him. For the moment, Selim ben Yussuf was out of
action and had ceased to interest himself in the phenomena
of this world.</p>

<p>Rising, the Emir took the stunned man's rifle, slung
it over his own back, and then took the reins of both
horses. Mounting his own, and seeing John Geste and
myself approaching, he again galloped off in pursuit
of the retreating raiders. It was not long before his
race-horse of a charger again brought him near to the band
of camel-riders. There was now no horseman to meet him on
equal terms and charge him, lance in hand. As he drew near,
two or three of those whose slower camels kept them in the
rear, turned in their saddles and opened fire. But it takes
a somewhat better marksman than the average Arab raider,
to hit a man on a galloping horse, when shooting from the
back of a trotting or cantering camel; nor did the plan of
halting and dismounting appeal to any of these stragglers,
in view of the fact that he would almost inevitably be cut
down or shot, in the act of doing so.</p>

<p>With a wild whoop, and raised automatic, into and
through the fleeing band, the Emir dashed. Men shouted,
swung long lances round, un-slung long guns, drew
swords, fired rifles, wheeled outward from the pursuing
Vengeance&mdash;did anything but halt.</p>

<p>"<i>Ride on</i>" was their last order, and their very present
inclination. At anyone who shot, cut or thrust at him, the
Emir fired, and, in a tenth part of the time that it takes
to tell, he was beside the leading camel&mdash;that of
Haroun el Ghulam Mahommed. With a curse, the raider thrust
his rifle sideways and downward and, without troubling
to bring it to his shoulder, fired. Although the muzzle
was not a yard from the Emir's body, the bullet missed
him, thanks to the movements of both horse and camel. But
an automatic pistol is different, and the robber Haroun
el Ghumal Mahommed died, as he would have wished to die,
weapon in hand and facing his man. With him died his camel
which the Emir instantly, though reluctantly, shot through
the head&mdash;and the band swept on, leaving behind it,
its fallen leader, its best camel, and its prisoner,
<i>l'Adjudant</i> Lebaudy.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>The half-hearted attempt at a rally and a stand was
quickly abandoned as the orderly line of the section of the
Emir's famous Camel Corps, riding at top speed, came into
sight. </p>

<h3>§ 3</h3>

<p> <i>L'Adjudant</i> Lebaudy interested me greatly that night,
when he returned the Emir's hospitality.</p>

<p>He was not a man of breeding, culture and refinement,
but he was a man of courage and tenacity; he was not what
is called a gentleman, but he was a strong man. He may
have been a petty tyrant, but he was not always and wholly
petty. He somewhat pointedly assured the Emir that the
latter could drink his coffee without fear, and that he
could please himself as to whether he slept where he dined.
He was grimly jocular, and his jokes were not always in the
best taste, but when we rose to depart, he shook hands with
the Emir, stood to attention, honoured him with a military
salute, and said:</p>

<p>"You are a brave man, Sidi Emir. You should have the
Medaille Militaire for what you did this morning. Instead,
you have my complete forgetting of all that happened before
dawn to-day.... And if there should be a prisoner missing,
I shall notify the authorities that it is extraordinary
that only one has been killed. Good-bye, Emir el Hamel el
Kebir."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Yes, an interesting man, our friend <i>l'Adjudant</i>
Lebaudy, and true to type, save that he was perhaps a
little bigger than most of his kind, and capable of a
certain generosity and magnanimity.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>My story grows long&mdash;and it might be very, very
long indeed.</p>

<p>We set out, next day, for the Great Oasis. Here I did
what I had hardly expected ever to do&mdash;embraced and
warmly kissed my sister's maid, Maud Atkinson&mdash;now my
sister-in-law and something of a desert princess.</p>

<p>I should love to have time and space to detail our
conversations and to describe our Maudie in her new rôle.
She obviously worshipped Noel, and confided to me that,
much as she loved Sheikhs, she was, on the whole, glad that
her Sheikh-like lord had proved (by slow degrees) to be a
white man. Repeatedly she assured me that he was a "one,"
and when, at length, the dear girl realized that I was
Noel's own brother, and her own brother-in-law, she could
only ejaculate a hundred times,</p>

<p>"Fancy that now!... Whoever would have thought it!... I
can't hardly believe it!"</p>

<p> . . . . . . . . .</p>

<p>I will not describe the solemn <i>mejliss</i> in which Noel
took leave of the assembled Sheikhs of his own and other
tribes, after telling them that he was going on a long
journey to visit his allies the <i>Franzawi</i>, nor of the
really heartrending and pathetic farewells between him and
the men with, and for, whom he had striven and worked and
schemed and fought.</p>

<p>But, at length, a large well-equipped and well-armed
caravan set out from the Great Oasis, and with it went
Marbruk ben Hassan and Yussuf Latif ibn Fetata in command
of the fighting men of the escort; and, in time, by slow
stages and by devious ways, the caravan arrived and
encamped not far from a town into whose fine harbour came
the ships of many nations&mdash;as they had done since the
days of the Phoenician tramp and the Roman trireme.</p>

<p>On to a ship flying the French flag, my companions dared
not go; and decided to voyage forth beneath either the
American or the British flag, according to which entered
the harbour first, for the sooner they were away the
better.</p>

<p>To the delight of Noel and Buddy, it was an American
ship that came&mdash;a huge vessel carrying a few hundred
tourists and returning to New York from Japan, visiting the
ports of the Southern Mediterranean, as she had visited
those of the Northern shore, on her outward voyage. A cable
to Isobel ensured that she would be awaiting John on the
landing-stage at New York. </p>

<h3>§ 4</h3>

<p> I feel that I have not told all that I should have
done, about John Geste....</p>

<p>This dear wonderful John Geste.... This true brother
of Beau Geste and of Digby Geste.... This man who could
not settle down in happiness even with Isobel,&mdash;the
wonderful and glorious woman who had given my life a
purpose, my mind a lifelong dream, my soul a <i>beau
idéal</i>&mdash;could not live even in that Paradise that her
presence made for those she loved, while his friends were
stranded where he had "deserted" them.... The man who loved
Isobel so deeply and truly and nobly, as he most surely
did&mdash;to <i>leave</i> her, after he had incredibly won back
to her&mdash;to leave her, with little probability that he
would see her face again! This is the greater love.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Poor John Geste....</p>

<p>I was almost amused&mdash;grimly, sadly amused, when he
again tried to thank me and to say good-bye, on that last
night.</p>

<p>His repressed emotions, his repressed British soul,
almost escaped. His British public-school reserve almost
melted....</p>

<p>He, Noel, Buddy and I, had eaten our last supper
together, and in silence smoked the last pipe of peace. As
the time drew near for us to seek our sleeping-rugs, John
Geste rose to his feet, stretched himself and yawned most
unconcernedly, and strode from the tent.</p>

<p>As he did so, he glanced at me, and with a jerk of his
head, bade me accompany him. I rose and followed him as he
strode out towards the cliff. Suddenly he wheeled about.</p>

<p>"Vanbrugh," he said, as he held out his hand. "I want to
say ..." and his sudden spate of words ended in the little
nervous cough that, in him, indicated strong feeling.</p>

<p>"What I want to try to tell you ..." he began again, and
got no further.</p>

<p>I would not help him. He was suffering an agony of
emotional discomfort, and was utterly inarticulate. But I,
too, was suffering an agony of pain, misery and grief.</p>

<p><i>He</i> was going back to Isobel; and I&mdash;to the Angel
of Death....</p>

<p>I had grown to love him as much, I believe, as one man
can love another. I had saved him. By God's grace and mercy
and help, I had saved him, and kept my word to Isobel....
Yes, I loved him, but I would not help him.</p>

<p>And more than anything I wanted to see whether he would
be able to "let himself go."</p>

<p>For myself, I somehow felt that had our positions been
reversed, and had he been sending me back to Isobel, I
should have embraced him. I should not have been able to
refrain from hugging him....</p>

<p>Not so John Geste.</p>

<p>"What I mean, Vanbrugh," he tried again, "is that....</p>

<p>"Well.... You understand, don't you.... You know what I
mean...."</p>

<p>And I heard my knuckles crack, as his grip tightened,
and he said it all in four words.</p>

<p>"My God!..." he ejaculated.... Er.... Oh!...</p>

<p>"<i>Stout fella!</i>" </p>

<h3>§ 5</h3>

<p> For the sake of his followers, Noel decreed that the
three were to remain Arabs until the ship sailed. Those
of the passengers, if any, who saw three Arab Sheikhs and
a heavily-veiled Arab woman arrive, must have been more
than a little astonished to behold them, next day, in
the ready-made reach-me-down garments of "civilization,"
previously purchased in the town.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>To this day I hate to think of that parting.</p>

<p>In one way, it was wonderful as being the consummation
of a life's work, or rather of the work for which I
had been born; in another way it was terrible, tragic,
unbearable.</p>

<p>I admit I was tempted&mdash;horribly tempted&mdash;and
I thought it was fine of the other three to say nothing
whatever to shake my resolution. They knew that I had given
my word, and they would not ask me to break it, and when
the Devil whispered in my ear, "A dancing girl&mdash;a
half-caste, half-savage thing from the bazaars of
Bouzen.... She doesn't expect it of you"... I clung grimly
to my poor honesty, and replied, "It's not a question of
what she is, but of what <i>I</i> am;&mdash;and I <i>do</i> expect
it of me." But it was a hard struggle. Nor was my misery
lightened by the sights and sounds around me, as the ship
steamed out of the harbour.</p>

<p>On a cliff, a mile or two from the town, my brother's
followers abandoned themselves to such transports of grief
as I have never witnessed before nor since.</p>

<p>With Oriental lack of restraint, they
wept&mdash;literally rent their clothing, and exhibited
every symptom of unappeasable misery and heart-breaking
grief. Brief&mdash;perhaps as brief as violent&mdash;but
starkly genuine and very terrible.</p>

<p>It was long enough in the case of a man called el
R'Orab, my brother's body-servant, and caused his death.
From the moment that he took leave of his master, he
neither ate nor drank nor spoke a word. He went about
his duties until he collapsed from weakness, and in his
weakness he died, refusing even water. Pitiful and absurd
as such conduct may seem to the European, it was highly
approved by the Arabs, not one of whom dreamed for a moment
of urging the man to eat or drink.</p>

<p>Just before he died, he painfully raised himself from
his prayer-rug and, seizing the hand of Yussuf Latif ibn
Fetata, who, with the help of Marbruk ben Hassan and
myself, was nursing him, said:</p>

<p>"We shall never look upon his face again."</p>

<p>Apparently this statement&mdash;regarded as inspired
because spoken by a dying man&mdash;was the last straw upon
the load of unhappiness borne by the fated Yussuf Latif.</p>

<p>That night, he left his sleeping-place beside Marbruk
and myself, and was seen by a sentry to go forth and stand
beneath the stars, his arms out-stretched towards the East.
With a loud and anguished cry of "<i>Leila Nakhla!... Leila
Nakhla!</i>..." he plunged his knife into his heart, and ended
the tragic life that had now become insupportable....</p>

<p>My own parting with Marbruk ben Hassan and the rest,
near Bouzen, did nothing to cheer my depressed and
miserable spirit, and it was in a most unenviable frame of
mind that I rode away with Abd'allah ibn Moussa toward the
camp of the old Sheikh Yussuf ben Amir at the Oasis of Sidi
Usman.</p>

<p>Abd'allah ibn Moussa was to ride in and discover if the
Death Angel was still under the old Sheikh's protection, or
whether she had returned to The Street, in Bouzen.</p>

<p>We camped, that night, beneath some palms, a
far-outlying picket of the great host of trees of the Sidi
Usman Oasis, and after a meal of dates, unleavened bread,
and curded cheese as hard as stone, Abd'allah ibn Moussa
rode off, bearing the message that I had seen my friend set
sail, and that I was here to fulfil my promise; also that
Selim ben Yussuf was a prisoner in the hands of the French
at Zaguig.</p>

<p>At the close of one of the most miserable days that
I have ever spent&mdash;somehow uncheered even by the
realization that I had saved John Geste and sent him back
to Isobel&mdash;Abd'allah returned. The Death Angel was
in the tents of old Yussuf ben Amir. Apparently she went
almost mad with joy at the news of my return, and Selim's
capture. She was coming out on the morrow, with a small
caravan of her own, to where Abd'allah and I now were. Her
message to me was:</p>

<p>"Await me there. I send you my heart and my soul, and
my life. I have given Sheikh Yussuf ben Amir that which
has made him the happiest man in the Sahara, and my slave
for ever&mdash;that Hair of the Beard of the Prophet that
the Sultan brought from Mecca and gave to my Mother. I
have done this to show you that I have given up Allah, and
now belong to God altogether, and am a perfect Christian
because you, my husband, are one."</p>

<p>It may be believed that I did not sleep that night.
Perhaps I sub-consciously feared somnambulism, and that I
should arise and ride for my life, even while I slept. </p>

<h3>§ 6</h3>

<p> She arrived next day.</p>

<p>Certainly her own resources, and those of Sheikh Yussuf
ben Amir, had been strained to their uttermost, judging
by the pomp and state in which she travelled. Quite a
small village of tents sprang up, as I saw when, at the
invitation of her messenger, I rode over to the spot where
she had pitched her camp. That the Sand Diviner's words
might prove true in every detail, it had been her whim that
I should come riding into her camp, and that she should run
forth from her tent to welcome me.</p>

<p>In her present manifestation she was
wonderful&mdash;gentle, sweet, submissive, and most
obviously longing to be "good"&mdash;to play the rôle of
civilized and Christian gentlewoman, and be wholly the
white daughter of her white father.</p>

<p>It was piteous and pathetic.</p>

<p>Her plan was that we should go to Bouzen, where we
should at once be married by a missionary, either Catholic
or Protestant, or both if I liked. There she would get her
jewels and instruct her Bank&mdash;as she was, I learned,
quite wealthy. From Bouzen we were to go to Algiers and
become European in every detail. From Algiers we were
to take ship for Marseilles and become more fashionably
European. From Marseilles we were to proceed to Paris and
become the last word in European fashion.</p>

<p>We were then to live happy ever after, wheresoever I
preferred, but the further we were from Africa, the happier
she would be.</p>

<p>Poor little soul!</p>

<p>A great feast was provided in the evening, and when
we could eat no more, we sat together upon the wonderful
cushioned rugs with which her tent was beautifully
provided. And when I, unintentionally, evinced my
unconquerable weariness, she bade me retire to the tent
which she had provided for me, and sleep my last sleep as
a lone and unloved man. As I rose to go, she held forth
her tiny hands, and, as I took them, drew me down beside
her.</p>

<p>From her neck she took the curious book-like amulet
which was her most cherished possession and, putting its
thin gold chain over my head, bade me wear it next my
heart, for ever. That it would shield me from every danger
was her deep certainty and sure conviction.</p>

<p>"My darling husband," she whispered, "I feel in my
soul&mdash;yes, from the very depths of my soul&mdash;that
this will save you...."</p>

<p>It did....</p>

<p>With her impassioned kisses warm upon my lips, I retired
to my tent and threw myself down upon its sumptuous bed
of cushions. The previous night I had not slept at all,
and life had been a burden and a misery since I had said
"good-bye" to John two weeks ago&mdash;two weeks that
seemed like years.</p>

<p>I was too tired to sleep. The hours dragged by with
leaden feet. Tossing and turning, groaning and cursing, I
longed for daylight&mdash;and longed that it might never
come.</p>

<p>Sitting up, I fingered the locket-amulet, now denuded
of its greatest and most sacred of all Arab charms the
(doubtless genuine) Hair of the Beard of the Prophet, but
still enriched by its (doubtless equally genuine) Christian
relic, the splinter of the wood of the True Cross.</p>

<p>Better not to open it now, by candlelight&mdash;as she
herself had once said, the tiny splinter of wood might fall
out and be lost&mdash;a loss that I could bear, but one
which would probably trouble her beyond measure....</p>

<p>But open it I did. Why, when I had just definitely
decided not to do so? The psychologist can, of course,
give the reason. I cannot. I know that my fingers opened
the locket without any conscious instructions from my
brain. I looked at the lovely face, beautifully painted on
ivory&mdash;of "Zaza Blanchfleur," the Ouled-Naïl dancing
girl, whom mighty Rulers had loved, and who had loved an
ordinary Englishman, who had deserted her.</p>

<p>Almost in the same second I glanced at the other face,
the face of that same man "Omar, the Englishman," the
father of the Angel of Death.</p>

<p>I then closed the locket and sat awhile in thought.
During that half-hour, my mind was as a leaf upon the
sloping surface of a whirlpool; as a straw in an eddy of
wind; nay, in a cave of all the winds, blowing in every
direction at once.</p>

<p>Twice or thrice I rose, to my feet, and then sank back
upon my cushions.</p>

<p>Finally I rose, scribbled the Death Angel a message of
four words, in French, on a scrap of paper, dressed myself
fully, and crept forth like a thief in the night. This was
not the camp of the Emir el Hamel el Kabir, or it would
have been impossible for me to do what I then did. No
wakeful sentries moved, watchful and alert upon their beat;
none listened, stared, and challenged. Apparently not a
soul was awake in the camp, except myself.</p>

<p>Creeping like a sneaking jackal to where the camels
knelt, I thanked God that mine and Abd'allah ibn Moussa's
were tethered in charge of our own camel-men, apart from
the rest. With ungentle toe, I roused the man who had been
in charge of my camel, ever since he became mine, and bade
him saddle both it and Abd'allah ibn Moussa's beast. If
I took this man with me, he could tell no tales in the
morning.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the camel-man and I were travelling
at maximum speed in the direction of Bouzen. </p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="first">
Arrived at Bouzen, I gave the camel-man money and a
letter for the Death Angel, and bade him await me for three
days in the market-place, and, at the end of that time, to
take the camels back to Abd'allah ibn Moussa and tell him
that I had gone on a journey.</p>

<p>I went straight to the railway station and, squatting
down, awaited the train for Algiers, as many other Arabs
were doing. Arrived at Algiers, I walked warily, gradually
accumulating a European outfit, and storing it in the
second-rate, or perhaps twenty-second rate, hotel, in which
I lived in the native quarter of the city.</p>

<p>It was a different Otis Vanbrugh, who now shuffled about
Algiers in <i>burnous</i> and heel-less slippers, from that Otis
Vanbrugh who, ages and æons agone, had descended from his
Mustapha Supérieur hotel to escort his sister on her visits
to the romantic Oriental bazaars.</p>

<p>In the crowd, hooded and bearded as I was, I was
perfectly safe; and in restful peace and safety, I abode
until the day when, having paid my bill, I went back to
my room, shaved my face completely, dressed myself in my
European clothes, seized my suit-case and grip, and marched
straight out of the house, picked up a ramshackle carriage
and drove to the quay where the good ship <i>Hoboken</i> awaited
me and divers other items.</p>

<p>By way of Oran, Marseilles, Gibraltar and Tangier, she
ploughed her uneventful way to New York, and, as in a
dream, rather stunned and stupid and mechanical, I stepped
once more upon my native soil.</p>

<p>My desire was to get home at the earliest moment and
to hear, once and for all, that John had, at last, safe
and sound, whole and hale and hearty, reached Isobel,
and turned her life from a nightmare of suffering into a
reality of happiness indescribable.</p>

<p>I endured the long, long train journey; I endured the
apparently longer journey by stage; and the third and
penultimate lap, by hired buggy, which brought me to where
I was right welcome to a night's shelter and the loan of a
good horse.</p>

<p>I started at dawn next morning, and a couple of hours'
ride brought me on to my Father's land. By afternoon, I
sighted the Ranch House, and, soon afterwards, drew rein by
the great verandah on which the family spent the major part
of what little time it lived indoors.</p>

<p>"Morning, Oats," drawled my brother, without rising from
the rocking-chair in which he was seated.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Boy," spake the voice of Buddy, and, as my
sun-dazzled eyes penetrated the shadow of the deep
verandah, I saw that I had arrived in time to interrupt a
family conclave.</p>

<p>There sat my Father, mighty, massive, domineering and
terrible as of old, glaring at me with an expression which
appeared to rebuke the presumption with which I dared
present myself before him unheralded. Obviously he was in a
towering rage.</p>

<p>Before him, miserable and shameful culprits, stood Buddy
and my sister Janey, tightly clasping each the other's
hand&mdash;Buddy white under the stress of some emotion,
his eyes blazing, his mouth a lipless gash in his set
face&mdash;Janey, of course, wilting and drooping, and
dissolved in tears.</p>

<p>"<i>Otis</i>," cried Mary's voice, and she dashed forward
from the side of a tall dark man arrayed in smart
riding-kit&mdash;the wide-cut tight-kneed style of which
our Western horsemen are supposed to despise&mdash;and,
without quite believing my eyes, I saw that it was her
husband Major de Beaujolais.... (But of course it had been
Mary's intention to bring him, sooner or later, to see her
home, and something of the life that she had lived almost
to the time that she had met him.) Dismounting and dropping
my rein over the horse's head, I took Mary in my arms for
a brief sound hug, and then followed her up the steps into
the verandah.</p>

<p>"What's the row?" I whispered before turning the corner,
to enter the grim presence of my irate parent.</p>

<p>"Janey wants to get engaged to Noel's friend Buddy," she
whispered. "Says she'll die if she doesn't. Dad says she'll
die if she does&mdash;and without his blessing&mdash;die of
poverty, misery, shame, hunger, Father's curse, domestic
slavery in a log cabin, disgrace, remorse, housemaid's
knee.... Puritan Father ... Scarlet Letter ..."</p>

<p>"In fact, Dad says '<i>No</i>'&mdash;and there's an end of
it, eh?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Mary. "Naturally he'd say
'No,' and there'd naturally be an end of it!... Who's
<i>Janey</i>&mdash;to dare to breathe, if Dad says she
mustn't."</p>

<p>"And Buddy?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He's torn between a longing to pull his gun on the
old man before doing a Young-Lochinvar-<i>into</i>-the-West
with Janey, and his fear that Janey will never speak to
him again if he dares be so impious and blasphemous as to
thwart our so-religious Dad."</p>

<p>"So she'll either die of thwarting Buddy by obeying
Dad, or else of thwarting Dad by obeying Buddy, eh?" I
observed.</p>

<p>"That's the position," agreed Mary, "and before Dad's
much older, he's going to hear something."</p>

<p>"From whom?" I asked.</p>

<p>"<i>Me</i>," said Mary, with jutting chin, "and Noel....
Saintly old man!... While boundlessly hospitable to
my husband, he is far from cordial, in fact barely
courteous, and alludes to him&mdash;not in his hearing of
course&mdash;as 'that Godless Frenchman,' or 'that foreign
idolater.' He gets more holy-righteous, every day!... But
come on, or he'll think we're conspiring, if you don't come
and prostrate yourself before him."</p>

<p>I greeted my Father with a respectful warmth and
cordiality that I did not feel, and received a grunt and
a contemptuous stare in reply. The old man certainly was
in a rage, and in one of his most violently autocratic and
overbearing moods.</p>

<p>I kissed Janey, and also gave Maudie a warm fraternal
embrace, wrung Noel's hand and that of Buddy, greeted de
Beaujolais diffidently&mdash;and selfishly obtruded my own
affairs immediately. The other matter could wait and I
could settle it.</p>

<p>"John safe?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, sure," was the reply.</p>

<p>"And with his wife?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Right there," was the reply from Noel.</p>

<p>"England, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"They wasn't, an hour ago," drawled Noel.</p>

<p>"Where are they?" I said, mastering a desire to hit
him.</p>

<p>"Now be reasonable, Son. How should I know where they
are?" replied Noel. "They went riding together about an
hour ago, and at the present moment they may be here or
there, or somewhere else.... She met us at New York," he
continued, "and as there wasn't a suitable ship for a week,
and John was ill, we just naturally brought them along
here."</p>

<p>"Then I may see them at any moment?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"You certainly may, Son, at any moment or any other
moment."</p>

<p>I sat down heavily on the nearest chair, for all my
strength had suddenly gone, and my knees were trembling.</p>

<p><i>I might see Isobel at any moment!...</i> And John
Geste!... Should I mount my horse again, and ride ... and
ride ... and ride...?</p>

<p>I could not ride away from myself, if I rode away from
her.</p>

<p>No, I would see Isobel, <i>once</i> again....</p>

<p>What was that booming, in my ears? Of course, the voice
of my Father.</p>

<p>"And that's that," he was roaring, "and let me hear
not another word about it, Janey.... And as for <i>you</i>,
my friend, you can get out of this just as quick as the
quickest horse will take you&mdash;and don't you come on to
this ranch again until you are quite tired of life. Get me?
Good afternoon." Buddy licked his lips, and stood firm.</p>

<p>"Now, Dad," said Noel, laying his hand on my Father's
arm. "Remember Janey's a grown-up woman, and Buddy's my
best friend, and I say...."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you when I want your say," shouted my Father,
"and Janey can sling off with him, and with my curse too,
if she likes, and they'd better go while the going's good,
and not come back either."</p>

<p>A wail and a fresh shower of tears from Janey, and an
oath from Buddy.</p>

<p>"Coming, Janey?" he asked, as he turned to go.</p>

<p>Janey literally threw herself on her knees before her
father. Noel rose from his chair, and Mary put her arm
round Janey.</p>

<p>"<i>Go</i>, my dear," she said. "<i>Go</i>, you little fool, and
be happy.... I'd be ashamed!... Don't you call your <i>soul</i>
your own?"</p>

<p>But Janey had no soul to call her own. It was her
father's, stamped and sealed. It was not filial love
that was working, nor wholly filial fear, but rather the
unbreakable habit of a lifetime, the inhibitions of a
father-complex.</p>

<p>I conquered my selfishness and, for the moment, thrust
self aside.</p>

<p>"Will everybody please go away&mdash;for exactly ten
minutes," I said, and became indeed the cynosure of
neighbouring eyes.</p>

<p>"Come on," I urged Buddy. "Get out, and take Janey
with you&mdash;and come back in ten minutes. Off you go,
Mary! Go on, Noel," and something in my voice and manner
prevailed, and I was left alone with my Father, to face him
and out-face him for the first time in my life. He gave a
bitter ugly laugh.</p>

<p>"Are you graciously pleased to allow me to remain?" he
sneered, "or do I also leave my house, to oblige you?"</p>

<p>From sarcasm he leapt to violent rage.</p>

<p>"Why, you insolent half-baked young hound," he roared,
springing to his feet, and, meanwhile, I had produced and
opened the Death Angel's locket.</p>

<p>As he advanced upon me, with blazing eyes and clenched
fist, I held it toward him, and his eyes fell upon the two
portraits.... It was dreadful.</p>

<p>I thought, for one awful moment, that I had killed my
Father.</p>

<p>He staggered back, smote his face with his clenched
fist, and dropped into a chair, white, shaking, and
stricken.</p>

<p>I felt dreadful, guilty, impious....</p>

<p>"<i>Oh, God!... Where is she?</i>" he gasped, fearing, I
suppose, that she was near.</p>

<p>"Dead," I replied.</p>

<p>He drew a deeper breath.</p>

<p>"<i>How did you get it?</i>" he asked, white-faced and
frightened.</p>

<p>"From your <i>daughter</i>," I answered, "... from my
<i>sister</i>."...</p>

<p>"<i>My God ... Where is she?</i>" he asked again, and I
pitied him even more than I hated myself.</p>

<p>"In Bouzen," I said. "Where you bought the Arab stallion
... and&mdash;other things...."</p>

<p>"<i>Does she know?</i>" he groaned.</p>

<p>"No," I replied.</p>

<p>"<i>To how many have you shown that?</i>" he asked, and it
seemed as though his whole life hung upon my answer.</p>

<p>"To no-one&mdash;yet," I replied, and added, as I
pocketed the locket:</p>

<p>"By the way, Father, this chap Buddy is one of the very
best, a real White Man.... He'd make a wonderful overseer
for this ranch, and a wonderful husband for Janey.... And I
might add that Major de Beaujolais is a most distinguished
officer, whose visit to us is a great honour; and further,
that Noel's wife, Maudie, is one of the best and bravest
little women that ever lived.... You see, Father?..."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>A long silence....</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>"I see, Son," replied my Father, at last, "and you can
give me that locket."</p>

<p>"Why, no, I can't do that, my dear Father," I
replied.... "When Janey's married, and Mary and de
Beaujolais have gone, and Noel and Maudie have settled down
here happily, and Buddy has an overseer's job, I must take
it back to its owner...."</p>

<p>"<i>Be careful of it</i>, meanwhile, Boy," said my Father.</p>

<p>"<i>Very</i> careful, Father," I replied, and shouted to the
others to return.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>They found Father wonderfully changed, and all went
merry as a wedding-bell. </p>

<h3>§ 2</h3>

<p> John and Isobel returned by moonlight.</p>

<p>John clasped my hand, held it, stared me in the
eyes&mdash;his fine level steady gaze&mdash;gave his little
cough of deepest feeling and embarrassment, and went into
the house without a word. Our silence was very eloquent.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>I sat down on the verandah steps, and Isobel, who had
stopped to give sugar to her horse, came toward me.</p>

<p>She did not know me until I removed my hat, and the
moonlight fell full upon my face.</p>

<p>Like John, she said nothing, but, putting up her little
hands, drew my head down and kissed me on the lips. She
threw her arms tightly about my neck and kissed me again.
The embraces and kisses were just those of the child Isobel
who had walked and talked and played with me in our Dream
Garden&mdash;as sweet and dear and beautiful and innocent
as those. Her little hands then stroked my hair, and again
we kissed, and then, still without a word, Isobel turned
and ran into the house.</p>

<p>That is the moment in which I should have died.</p>

<p>Instead, I took a horse and rode away.</p>

<p>I rode further and harder than I had ever done in all my
life, but I was not cruel to my horse. Who, that had been
kissed by Isobel, should be cruel, or ever mean or base or
bad?</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p>Am I happy?</p>

<p>Dear God! Who that has been kissed by Isobel is not
happy? </p>
