<h3>A SHORT STORY</h3>

<h3>Presumably first published in <i>Argosy All-Story Weekly</i> in
1924<br>
<br>
This e-book edition: Project Gutenberg Australia, 2015</h3>

<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">IN order to recuperate from the strain of the
tremendous publicity that followed upon her success in the famous
case of the Smoke Bandit, Mme. Storey retired for a few days to the
house of her close friends, the Andrew Lipscombs, who lived in the
Connecticut hills remote from any neighbor. I accompanied my
employer, since she insisted that I needed a holiday as well as
herself.</p>

<p>We simply locked up, our offices and went away, leaving the
telephone to ring, the mail to accumulate, and the hordes of
curiosity-seekers to mill around the door as they would. We
supposed that we had kept the place of our retreat a secret from
all, but that fond hope was soon dissipated. Late on the night of
our arrival, as we were playing bridge with our friends in the
blessed quietude of their house, my employer was called to the
telephone.</p>

<p>She returned to the card table with the grave remote look that I
knew so well, her working look, and my heart sank.</p>

<p>"Well, Bella, we have another case," she said.</p>

<p>I laid down my cards. It was useless to protest, of course.</p>

<p>"There's been a terrible affair down at Fremont-on-the-Sound,"
she went on. "A gentleman has been found shot dead in his study,
and a young girl has been arrested. The man who called me up,
evidently the girl's lover, begged me to come and try to get her
off. His voice coming through the receiver had an extraordinary
quality; young an manly; shaken with grief and agitation; yet proud
and confident of his girl; it won me completely. I said I would
drive right down."</p>

<p>"Murder?" said Mr. Lipscomb, startled, "and so close to, us?
Who's been murdered?"</p>

<p>"Cornelius Suydam."</p>

<p>"Good God!" cried our host, springing up. "Why, he's the great
man of the neighborhood. His house, Fernhurst, is one of the show
places! Who is said to have killed him?"</p>

<p>"The girl's name is Laila Darnall."</p>

<p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Lipscomb stared at my employer in a stupefied
fashion. The former was the first to find his voice.</p>

<p>"Merciful Heaven!" he gasped. "She's his ward! Said to be richer
than he is. An exquisite young creature; a sort of golden princess;
we see her being whisked about in automobiles from one great
country house to another. Oh, this will create a terrible
sensation! Who called you up?"</p>

<p>"He called himself Alvan Wayger."</p>

<p>"I never heard of him."</p>

<p>"A sort of princess!" Mrs. Lipscomb echoed, aghast. "With
everything in the world a girl could wish for! Why on earth should
she want to kill her guardian?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mme. Storey. We must go and find out. Will
you lend me a car and a chauffeur?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I'll go with you for a bit of extra protection. I
suppose you'll be out the rest of the night. It's near midnight
now."</p>

<p>The distance was about twenty miles and we made it in better
than thirty minutes.</p>

<p>Fernhurst proved to be an immense country house built of stone
in the elaborate style of twenty-five years ago, and standing in
its own private park. The house was all lighted but we found it
perfectly deserted except for a solitary constable on guard, and
the young man who had telephoned to Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>He was a striking looking fellow with a shock of shining black
hair, and fiery dark eyes. Somewhat rough in dress and abrupt in
manner, but with a glance full of resolution and capacity. It was
that kind of terribly direct glance which is disconcerting to
ordinary persons, but it is always a sure passport to Mme. Storey's
favor.</p>

<p>In spite of his grinding anxiety, his whole face softened at the
sight of my employer's beauty. It was a fine tribute.</p>

<p>"I never thought you would be like this," he murmured.</p>

<p>They wasted no time in exchanging amenities.</p>

<p>The young man explained that everybody in the house had just
gone down to the magistrate's in the village, where a preliminary
hearing was about to be held.</p>

<p>"We mustn't miss anything that takes place at that hearing,"
Mme. Storey said crisply. "Drive on down, Bella, and take notes of
the proceedings. I will follow as soon as I have looked over the
ground here."</p>

<p>I was directed to a large old-fashioned double house standing at
the head of one of the village streets. This was the residence of
Judge Waynham, the magistrate.</p>

<p>Already there were half a dozen cars standing in the road, and a
knot of people whispering at the gate. A strange sight at midnight
in the quiet village! Mr. Lipscomb, who did not wish to intrude
himself in any way, waited in the car. Inside, there were people
all over the house. No one questioned my presence.</p>

<p>The magistrate had not yet come downstairs and everybody was
standing about with frozen, horrified faces. A maidservant was
threading her way back and forth among them. The judge's office was
in the back parlor on the left hand side, and everybody tried to
push in there, a quaint room which suggested the era of 1885.</p>

<p>I saw the accused girl sitting on a little sofa with her face
hidden on the shoulder of a youngish woman in black. Picture a
slender, silken girl wearing a flower-like evening dress of printed
chiffon and a white fur cloak which had slipped back. I could not
see her face, but the short fair curls that showed against her
slender neck were somehow most piteous. She was making no sound,
but her delicate girlish shoulders were shaken with sobs.</p>

<p>It was too dreadful to think of anything so fresh and young and
fair in connection with murder. As more and more people crowded in,
they opened the folding doors into the front parlor.</p>

<p>The distracted maidservant was bringing in chairs. I maneuvered
myself alongside a comfortable village matron who looked promising
as a source of information. She whispered to me that the lady in
black was Mr. Suydam's housekeeper, Miss Beckington.</p>

<p>A good-looking woman of thirty-five I should have said, who
appeared younger; very modish, very efficient, one guessed, though
at present the tears were rolling down her checks as she held the
girl close.</p>

<p>Miss Beckington was something more than a mere housekeeper, my
informant added, since she was a person of good family herself, and
perfectly capable of acting as hostess to Mr. Suydam's guests.</p>

<p>She was wearing a plain black morning dress, a close-fitting hat
and a raccoon coat. Near these two sat a portly, nervous-looking
elderly gentleman, fingering his watch chain. This I learned was
Judge Gray, the girl's lawyer.</p>

<p>The magistrate entered the room. He had forgotten to brush his
hair and it stood straight up all over his head in a very odd
fashion. A rosy, kindly old gentleman, he was so nervous and
distressed he scarcely knew what he was saying.</p>

<p>"Who are all these people?" he demanded. "After all, this is my
private house!"</p>

<p>Nobody answered him, and he was obliged to accept the crowd. He
had the constable shepherd everybody but the principals into the
front room.</p>

<p>I got myself a chair in the second row where I could use my
notebook without being conspicuous.</p>

<p>Judge Waynham sat at his desk facing the rest of us, and a
scared village stenographer took a place beside him with her
notebook.</p>

<p>"Laveel," said the magistrate sharply, "you made the arrest, I
assume. It is your place to lay a charge."</p>

<p>This was the chief constable, a tall, lanky man with a good
humored, heavily-seamed face. Like everybody else connected with
the case he seemed completely overcome. He stood beside the
magistrate's desk hanging his head as if he were the guilty one,
and mumbled in a scarcely audible voice:</p>

<p>"I charge Miss Laila Darnall with the murder of her guardian,
Cornelius Suydam."</p>

<p>One could feel a shiver go through the room. Suddenly the girl
sprang to her feet, showing us all a white and agonized face, the
face of a terrified and uncomprehending child.</p>

<p>Her slender frame was racked with sobs, but her eyes were
dry.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that desperate face.</p>

<p>Though the other woman and the lawyer tried to silence her, she
cried out:</p>

<p>"How could I--how could I have done such a thing? Don't you
believe me? Have I not a friend here? Why has everybody turned
against me? I am the, same girl!"</p>

<p>Perceiving three handsomely dressed ladies sitting in the front
row--these, I learned, were her cousins--she ran to them
crying:</p>

<p>"Helen! Isabel! You believe me, don't you? You know I could not
have done such a thing. Tell them all that you believe me!"</p>

<p>"Hush, Laila!" said one of them in cold correct tones. "Yes we
believe you. But let the proceedings go on."</p>

<p>Laila turned from her in despair.</p>

<p>"Haven't I a friend here?" she cried.</p>

<p>Miss Beckington held out her arms.</p>

<p>"Come, dear," she said tenderly, while the tears rolled down her
cheeks. "I am your friend. I know you could not have done it!"</p>

<p>The girl flung herself into her arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you! Thank you!" she murmured, weeping freely at
last. "Forgive me because I have not always been friendly toward
you. Once I thought you were cold and unfeeling."</p>

<p>They sank down on the sofa together. It was very affecting, the
more so because one could see that Miss Beckington was ordinarily a
somewhat hard and self-controlled young woman.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to answer to this charge, my child?" asked Judge
Waynham.</p>

<p>"I didn't do it! I didn't do it!" she cried without raising her
face from Miss Beckington's shoulder.</p>

<p>"The prisoner pleads not guilty," murmured the magistrate to his
stenographer. "Who is your complaining witness?" he asked the
constable.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lumley, your honor, Mr. Suydam's butler."</p>

<p>This man stepped forward to testify. A large, soft-looking man
with a dead white skin, he was obviously educated and intelligent,
and made a very good impression. He kept glancing at his young
mistress commiseratingly. His obvious unwillingness to testify
against her, gave his evidence all the more deadly effect.</p>

<p>While he was speaking Mme. Storey and Alvan Wayger entered the
front parlor from the hall, and took seats in the darkest
corner.</p>

<p>I had a great curiosity concerning this interesting young man
who was said to be the heiress's lover. The village matron was
still beside me. Calling her attention to him, I asked who he
was.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's Alvan Wayger," she said indifferently. "He's nobody
in particular. New people here. Haven't made friends much. They say
he's a clever inventor, but I never heard of his inventions. Lives
with his mother in a little house across the railway tracks. That's
his mother against wall across the room."</p>

<p>I saw a plain, middle-aged won glancing at her son and his
unknown companion with that peculiar jealousy that one sometimes
sees in the faces of mothers with an only son. It is a sad thing to
see.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey, who had just arrived, had draped a light veil
around the brim of her hat so that she could see all without being
recognized. Lumley, the butler, testified as follows:</p>

<p>"My name is Alfred Lumley. I have been employed by Mr. Cornelius
Suydam as butler for the past four years. At the present time the
household consists of Mr. Suydam, his ward, Miss Darnall, his
housekeeper, Miss Beckington, myself butler, Mrs. Finucane cook,
and five maids. There is also Dugan the engineer, who has a room in
the basement; Leavitt, the gardener, who lives with his family in a
cottage at the park gates; and Pressley and Gordon, chauffeurs,
unmarried men who board with the gardener's wife.</p>

<p>"I retired tonight shortly before eleven. There were no guests
in the house, and I believed at the time that everybody was in bed
except my master, whom I left reading in his study, as was his
custom. The study occupies a separate wing of the house, somewhat
cut off from the other rooms.</p>

<p>"I was in bed, but had not fallen asleep when I heard the
muffled sound of a shot. Had I been asleep I should probably not
have heard it. But I knew it came from inside the house. You could
tell by the ring of it. I sprang out of bed and flung on my
clothes. I heard the clock of St. Agnes's strike eleven. My room is
on the third floor of the house.</p>

<p>"I didn't attempt to waken any of the women folks, but ran down
the two flights of stairs. I knocked on the library door. No
answer. I tried the door. It was locked."</p>

<p>"One moment," interrupted Judge Waynham, "was it your master's
custom to lock the door when he was in his library?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. No, indeed, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, go on."</p>

<p>"I called loudly. There was no answer. My first thought was of
robbers. The safe was in the library. I could not tell how many
people there might be, and I was afraid to venture outside the
house alone. So I ran down to the basement and wakened Dugan. He
was provided with a gun and electric torches.</p>

<p>"He threw on his clothes and came with me. We went out the front
door and around the house to the library windows. There is a big
bay with French windows opening directly on the terrace. The
windows were open."</p>

<p>"Cool as it is?" interrupted the magistrate.</p>

<p>"It was my master's custom, sir the room was brightly lighted.
We saw--"</p>

<p>Lumley hesitated, and a shudder went through his stout
frame.</p>

<p>"Go on," prompted Judge Waynham.</p>

<p>"My master was seated at his desk in the center of the room. His
head had fallen forward on the desk blotter. There was a bullet
hole just back of the left temple. His blood had spread over the
desk and was already dripping to the floor. He was dead. The door
of the safe stood wide open. Beside it, lying open and face down on
the rug was a little memorandum book. I recognized it as a book my
master always carried upon his person. On the open page was written
down the combination of the safe. . The safe was full of papers,
none of which appeared to have been disturbed, but there was a
little drawer which had been pulled out and emptied. An emptied
jewel box lay beside it."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," interrupted Judge Waynham, "that Mr.
Suydam sat in that brightly lighted room late at night with the
windows open and unshuttered?"</p>

<p>"Such was his custom, sir," said Lumley deprecatingly. "I had
ventured to remonstrate with him about it, but he only laughed at
the idea of personal danger. The windows were protected by copper
screens, of course. The murderer had fired through the screen, and
had then raised it to enter."</p>

<p>"Well, go on."</p>

<p>"Dugan and I searched outside with the electric torches.
Bordering the terrace is a flower bed, and in the loose earth of
the bed we immediately found the tracks of the murderer where he
had come and where he had left again. Only one set of tracks. They
appeared to be those of a large man wearing rubbers, but there was
a peculiarity in the tracks."</p>

<p>"Please explain yourself."</p>

<p>"Well, in the middle of the print of each foot there was a
roughness which suggested to both of us that the rubbers had been
tied to the wearer's feet by strips of rag or something of that
sort."</p>

<p>The man's story was almost too painful to follow. A deathly
silence filled the room which suggested that his hearers were
actually holding their breath.</p>

<p>"We followed the tracks to the edge of the flower bed," he went
on. "In the grass we lost them, but knowing that a person leaving a
place in a hurry usually runs in a straight line, I kept on in the
same direction. This took us across a rosebed in the center of the
lawn, and here I found the tracks again. By taking a line with the
library window and the rose bed we were enabled to find the tracks
again where the murderer had struck into the woods. A little way in
the woods we came to a place where the earth had been recently
disturbed."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, a hole had been dug, and hastily filled in again. We dug
there and found first a pair of old over shoes gray with dust and
dried mud; secondly a thirty-two caliber automatic pistol; thirdly
several pieces of diamond jewelry tied up in a woman's
handkerchief. Dugan immediately recognized the overshoes as an old
pair that he used in the winter when he shoveled snow. He had last
seen them lying beside the furnace pit where they had been dropped
and forgotten."</p>

<p>Lumley hesitated, with a piteous glance in the direction of his
young mistress.</p>

<p>"Go on! Go on!" said Judge Waynham impatiently.</p>

<p>"The tracks that led away from that place had been made by a
woman," said Lumley very reluctantly. "She was wearing what is
called, I think, a common sense shoe, that is a shoe with a
moderately broad toe and a low heel. The tracks led us toward the
main driveway, but we lost them in the grass before we got there,
and, of course, the hard driveway revealed nothing. So we turned
back toward the house meaning to call the police."</p>

<p>His voice sank.</p>

<p>"As we approached the house we saw a figure standing in the
driveway, its back toward us. The figure of a woman. We stepped
into the grass to avoid giving warning of our approach. A moment
later I recognized Miss Darnall." A low murmur of horror escaped
from the listeners.</p>

<p>"When I touched her she screamed," Lumley went on, "I thought
she was about to collapse in a faint."</p>

<p>The girl suddenly cried out:</p>

<p>"Was that strange? Was that strange? A man coming up on you in
the dark without warning!"</p>

<p>Judge Gray and Miss Beckington quieted her.</p>

<p>"I led her into the house," Lumley went on unhappily. "As soon
as we got in the light I saw that though she was dressed just as
you see her now, that she was wearing shoes with broad toes and low
heels. Moreover the gun was quickly identified as one which had
been given her by Mr. Suydam some months ago. It was his opinion
that everybody ought to be furnished with the means of personal
defense. One shot had been fired from it. The handkerchief was also
Miss Darnall's. It has her initials embroidered on it."</p>

<p>There was a silence. The girl's shuddering sobs could be heard.
Miss Beckington patted her shoulder. Judge Waynham wiped his
agitated face on his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Well, is that all you have to say?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not quite all, sir," said Lumley in an almost inaudible voice,
while we in the front room leaned forward to hear. "I had Miss
Beckington roused up, and I delivered Miss Darnall into her care. I
forced Miss Darnall to take off one of her shoes--I thought it my
duty to do so, and Dugan and I returned to the woods with it. I had
read somewhere that the proper procedure was not to attempt to fit
the shoe into the suspected tracks, but to make a new impression
alongside. This I did. I am sorry to say that the impressions
corresponded exactly. That is all I have to say, sir. When I got
back to the house I telephoned for the police."</p>

<p>Laveel, the constable, laid the sport shoe on the desk.</p>

<p>"One question," said Judge Waynham. "How could Miss Darnall ever
have got hold of those overshoes? I assume she was not in the habit
of visiting the cellar."</p>

<p>"I asked that question of Dugan, sir," said Lumley. "He told me
that a week ago when he was confined to his bed by an attack of
tonsilitis, Miss Laila came down to his room to visit him. To reach
his room she had to pass the furnace. She must have seen the
overshoes then."</p>

<p>The girl tore herself out of the protecting arm of Miss
Beckington. Her soft young face worked piteously.</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" she cried. "I never saw the overshoes until
to-night! It's all lies! I--I--"</p>

<p>Judge Gray put an arm around her shoulders.</p>

<p>"My child," he said soothingly, "be silent! This is neither the
time nor the place. You must be guided by me."</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>"Let me be!" she cried hysterically. "I will speak! I won't have
these people thinking I did this awful thing! I can explain
everything. I have nothing to conceal. I had been out of the house
ever since nine o'clock," she went on wildly and incoherently. "As
for my shoes, I always put on sport shoes when I went out in the
park at night. Would they have me wear slippers? Since nine
o'clock! I heard no shot. I didn't know anything was the matter.
But when I got back to the house I found that the hall was lighted
up and the front door standing open. So I was afraid to go in.
That's why I was standing there looking at the house.</p>

<p>"My handkerchief? My handkerchief, I still have it with me. One
wouldn't carry two. In the pocket of my cape--"</p>

<p>Turning, she searched with frantic trembling hands in the folds
of the cape.</p>

<p>"It's here--I'll show you."</p>

<p>Then a despairing cry:</p>

<p>"Oh, it's gone! I swear I had it awhile ago!"</p>

<p>She dropped on the sofa shaken with fresh sobs. It was an
unspeakably painful exhibition.</p>

<p>"What did you go out of the house for?" Judge Waynham asked
gently. "You don't need to answer unless you wish."</p>

<p>"Yes, Yes, I will answer," she cried, striving hard for
self-control. "I went out to meet my--to meet the man I am engaged
to marry. He wasn't allowed to come to the house, I was forbidden
to see him. That's why I had to meet him by stealth. I'm not
ashamed of it. It's Alvan Wayger."</p>

<p>A soft, long-drawn Oh-h! of astonishment escaped from the
listeners. In a village where everybody prided themselves on
knowing everything, this was a startling disclosure. The heiress
and the poor young inventor! Everybody looked at the handsome dark
young man who sat there with a perfectly blank mask upon his
face.</p>

<p>So far as I had observed the two had not once looked at each
other during the proceedings. Judge Waynham energetically polished
his glasses. When he recovered from his surprise, he looked
relieved. I think we all had the same thought: perhaps, after all,
here was a perfectly natural explanation of the girl's
movements.</p>

<p>"Will you answer a few questions, Mr. Wayger?" asked the
judge.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," said the young man, marching up to his
desk.</p>

<p>"Miss Darnall met you in the park at Fernhurst to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. We had an appointment to meet at nine o'clock at a
certain stone bench under an elm tree near the entrance gates."</p>

<p>"How long did she remain with you?"</p>

<p>"About two hours, sir."</p>

<p>"Can't you tell me exactly what time you left her?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I didn't look."</p>

<p>"Did you then go straight home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"How long does it take you to walk home?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen minutes, sir."</p>

<p>"At what time did you reach home?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you exactly, sir, I took no notice."</p>

<p>Here there was an interruption from the front room.</p>

<p>"If you please, judge, I can tell you," said a bitter voice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wayger, the young man's mother, had risen. She cast a look
of jealous dislike on the girl.</p>

<p>"I was lying awake when my son came home," she said.</p>

<p>"After he was in his room I heard the clock in St. Agnes's
steeple strike eleven."</p>

<p>She sat down again. Young Wayger received this without a sign of
emotion beyond lowering his head slightly. His face was not hard,
but simply inscrutable.</p>

<p>For my part, I could not help but sympathize with his
determination not to betray his private feelings before that gaping
crowd. Judge Waynham's face fell.</p>

<p>"So," he said heavily, "then it appears you must have left her
at a quarter to eleven or earlier." Wayger made no answer.</p>

<p>"Miss Laila," said Judge Waynham, turning to the girl, "if Mr.
Wayger left you at a quarter to eleven, and Lumley found you at a,
quarter past eleven, what had you been doing during that half hour?
You need not answer unless you wish."</p>

<p>We all held our breath waiting for what she would say.</p>

<p>"I will--answer--I will answer," she stammered. "I hadn't been
doing anything, just walking up and down the driveway. I was
greatly troubled in my mind. I was trying to think--to think of
some way out!"</p>

<p>It was a deplorably lame answer.</p>

<p>In spite of his iron self-control, I saw a spasm of pain pass
across the young man's face. I think we all gave the girl up for
lost then.</p>

<p>Judge Waynham's kindly old face was heavy with distress. He
tapped his glasses on his desk blotter while he considered.
Suddenly a gleam of hope lighted up his eyes.</p>

<p>"The circumstances are unfortunate, most unfortunate," he said,
"but no motive for such a terrible deed has been shown, or even
suggested. Mr. Wayger, I would like to ask you a few more
questions."</p>

<p>The young man signified his readiness to answer.</p>

<p>"What were the relations between Miss Darnall and her
guardian?"</p>

<p>"I object!" said Judge Gray instantly.</p>

<p>Judge Waynham wagered a soothing hand in his direction.</p>

<p>"This is only a magistrate's hearing," he said. "You will have
your day before a jury later."</p>

<p>He repeated his question of Wayger. That young man's face
hardened.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I care to answer that," he said firmly.</p>

<p>"It's not up to me to repeat what I learned from Miss Darnall in
confidence."</p>

<p>At this juncture Mme. Storey raised her clear, distinct voice
from the back of the room. If you had heard that voice in the dark
you would have known that it belonged to some one notable.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wayger, I advise you to answer," she said. "The whole truth
must come out. By your apparent reluctance you are only prejudicing
Miss Darnall's interest."</p>

<p>All the people goggled at the veiled woman, and looked at each
other.</p>

<p>"Who is this?" you could see them saying The young man instantly
changed his attitude.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "The relations between Miss Darnall and
her guardian were bad. He was a very oppressive guardian. He had
peculiar notions. It is well known that Miss Darnall's income runs
into hundreds of thousands of dollars annually, but he would not
allow her a cent of spending money."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Judge Waynham.</p>

<p>"It is quite true, sir. Of course she was provided with
everything a fashionable young lady might be supposed to require.
She was encouraged to buy whatever she wanted in the shops and have
the bills sent in. But she had no money to spend. She was not
allowed to drive her own car. In fact she was never allowed out
unless accompanied by a chauffeur or a chaperon. All this was very
galling on a girl of spirit.</p>

<p>"We wished to get married," he went on in his quiet,
self-respecting manner, "but that was quite out of the question, of
course. I have all I can do to make ends meet as it is, and Mr.
Suydam had absolute control over Miss Darnall's money for two years
longer, and partial control for four years after that. He had no
use for me at all. He made no bones of calling me an impostor and a
fortune hunter. That didn't bother me at all I have my work to do,
but it distressed Miss Darnall very much."</p>

<p>"But this has been going on for some time," suggested Judge
Waynham. "This would not account for Miss Darnall's special trouble
of mind tonight. Can you tell me what caused that?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir. It was what we had been talking about all
evening. I have completed an invention. I need not go into detail
about it. Properly applied, my invention would revolutionize a
certain important industry. Well, I have received an offer from the
corporation which controls that industry. Miss Darnall was strongly
opposed to my accepting the offer. It was not a good offer, and,
what's more, there is reason to suppose that they mean to suppress
my invention, as is sometimes done.</p>

<p>"Miss Darnall wanted to finance it, so that we could start
manufacturing on our own account in competition with the trust. It
was not the money she was thinking of so much as the publicity. She
believed it would make me famous. But Mr. Suydam had positively
refused to let her have the money."</p>

<p>"And the matter was at a critical stage?" asked Judge
Waynham.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I am forced to accept this offer. Inventors must
live."</p>

<p>"Hm!" said the judge unhappily. "What were the conditions of the
late Mr. Darnall's will?"</p>

<p>"I see Mr. George Greenfield in the next room," Wayger said. "He
is Mr. Suydam's attorney, and he can answer that question better
than I can."</p>

<p>Mr. Greenfield was called upon.</p>

<p>He was a handsome, middle-aged man with a youthful air, and a
good-tempered expression, the sort of man that children
instinctively take to.</p>

<p>As he came forward, he cast a deeply compassionate look on the
unfortunate young girl. In answer to Judge Waynham's question, he
carefully explained the provisions of her father's will.</p>

<p>I need not repeat them beyond stating that Mr. Suydam was given
absolute control of her affairs. In case of Mr. Suydam's death the
will provided that Mr. Greenfield himself was to succeed him as
Laila's guardian and trustee.</p>

<p>"Do you corroborate what this young man has told us respecting
Mr. Suydam's attitude as guardian?" Judge Waynham asked him.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry that I must," he said regretfully; "for Mr. Suydam
was one of my best friends. It was not mere harshness that made him
behave in this manner. He was actuated by the best of motives. He
looked about him and he saw how the young people of today were
running wild, as he put it. It was to save Laila from that that he
kept her under such strict control. I have often attempted to show
him that he was mistaken in his method, but he was a very
self-willed man."</p>

<p>"Had you heard anything about this invention of Mr.
Wayger's?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Only today I lunched with Mr. Suydam at, Fernhurst. Miss
Darnall waylaid me as I arrived, and carried me to her sitting
room, where she told me all about it, and implored me to use my
influence to persuade her guardian to advance the money necessary
to finance Mr. Wayger's invention. But, knowing Mr. Suydam as well
as I did, I told her it was useless. The poor girl was much upset.
'Can nothing be done?' she cried."</p>

<p>"And what did you reply?" asked Judge Waynham.</p>

<p>Mr. Greenfield started to answer, then as a sudden realization
came to him, caught himself up, and changed color painfully.</p>

<p>"I would rather not answer that," he said in a muffled
voice.</p>

<p>"I must insist," said Judge Waynham.</p>

<p>"I answered jestingly," said Mr. Greenfield anxiously. "It had
no significance whatever. I said, 'Nothing short of giving
Cornelius a whiff of poison gas.' It was only in jest."</p>

<p>"Oh, quite, quite!" said Judge Waynham, and both men laughed in
a strained fashion.</p>

<p>But the incident created a very unfortunate impression. Judge
Waynham seemed to give up hope. His kindly face sagged with weary
discouragement. He hesitated, tapping the blotter with his glasses.
He could not bear to condemn that daintily reared girl to a cell,
but he had no choice.</p>

<p>"I am reluctantly forced to order that Miss Darnall be--" Mme.
Storey interrupted him.</p>

<p>Rising and throwing back her veil, she said in that arresting
voice of hers:</p>

<p>"Mr. Magistrate, before you close the case, if I might be
permitted to put a few questions in the light of what I have
learned."</p>

<p>Judge Waynham's jaw dropped in pure astonishment.</p>

<p>"But, madam, who are you?" he asked.</p>

<p>Alvan Wayger answered for her.</p>

<p>"Mme. Rosika Storey," he announced.</p>

<p>There was a general exclamation of surprise and interest. Every
head in the room turned toward my employer as if moved by a common
lever. For the moment even the unfortunate Laila Darnall was
forgotten. At this time Mime. Storey was the most talked of woman
in the country, I suppose. "The cleverest woman in New York," the
newspapers were calling her.</p>

<p>Everybody present had the feeling that her entrance into the
case would make their insignificant village famous. The good little
magistrate flushed and stammered in his gratification.</p>

<p>"But of course, of course. I am honored, Fremont is honored by
your presence amongst us, madame. Won't you be good enough to join
me on the bench. I mean at my desk."</p>

<p>He relieved his feelings by suddenly shouting for the maid.</p>

<p>"Nettie! Place a chair for Mme. Storey!"</p>

<p>Serenely oblivious to the goggling eyes, my employer seated
herself beside him.</p>

<p>"A prima facie case appears to have been made out," she drawled.
"Still there are one or two little matters that might be gone into
further."</p>

<p>Instantly everybody realized that the case, instead of closing,
was only just starting.</p>

<p>"Miss Darnall required a large sum of money," Mme. Storey
continued. "Therefore the few pieces of jewelry that were taken
could have been of no use to her. The theory is, of course, that
she opened the safe and took the jewelry merely to make it appear
that robbers had done the deed. A very, very clever plot!</p>

<p>"Well, if she was such a clever plotter, why didn't she plot a
little further, and leave a way open to return to the house? She
must have realized that some one would likely be awakened by the
shot? There is a discrepancy here."</p>

<p>I saw a hope dawn in the magistrate's harassed face.</p>

<p>"I have made a hasty examination of Mr. Suydam's study," Mme.
Storey went on, "and--er--some other rooms in the house.
Unfortunately for my purposes, the body had already been removed to
Mr. Suydam's bedroom. I should therefore like to ask the butler a
question or two concerning it, if I may."</p>

<p>Judge Waynham made haste to give an assent.</p>

<p>"Lumley," said Mme. Storey, "you told us you left your master
reading when you went to bed. But when you found his body he was
sitting at his desk. This was not a position for reading, was
it?"</p>

<p>"No, madam. When I found him his fountain pen was still grasped
in his right hand, and his left hand was spread on the blotter in
such a way as to suggest that it was holding a paper. He was
undoubtedly writing at the moment he was shot."</p>

<p>"But the paper itself was gone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam."</p>

<p>"This suggests that he was writing something which was of
interest to the murderer," remarked Mme. Storey, "who therefore
carried it away. That's all for the moment, thanks.</p>

<p>"On Mr. Suydam's desk," she went on to Judge Waynham, "I found
an ordinary calendar and memorandum pad on the top leaf of which he
had written: 'Write G. G.,' then a dash and the word 'will.'
Underneath was another memorandum: 'Write Eva Dinehart.' Now I take
it 'G. G.,' is Mr. Greenfield."</p>

<p>That gentleman spoke up for himself.</p>

<p>"Yes, madam; such was Mr. Suydam's nickname for me."</p>

<p>"Had you had any discussion with him to-day about his will?"</p>

<p>"No, madam, it was not mentioned."</p>

<p>"Have you his will?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam, I drew it up. It is kept in my safe."</p>

<p>"Had you had any talk with him that would make it necessary for
him to write to you?"</p>

<p>"No, madam. Whatever it was, it must have come up after I had
gone."</p>

<p>"What time did you leave him?"</p>

<p>"Three o'clock."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Now Lumley, what did your master do after Mr.
Greenfield had gone?"</p>

<p>"He had Miss Beckington into the library, madame," the butler
answered with a wondering air.</p>

<p>None of us could see which way this questioning was tending.</p>

<p>"It was their day for going over the household bills."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me anything about what took place between
them?"</p>

<p>"N-no, madam."</p>

<p>"Why do you hesitate?"</p>

<p>"Well, there was an incident which was a little unusual."</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Suydam called on the phone, and asked me to connect him
with Central. Ordinarily he would let me get him what he
wanted."</p>

<p>"You listened?" suggested Mme. Storey with a bland air.</p>

<p>"Well--yes, ma'am," said the butler in some confusion. "Mr.
Suydam asked for information. He read the names of three New York
business firms over the wire, and asked to be given their telephone
numbers. I remember the firms. They were: N. Hamill &amp; Sons,
Nicholas Enslin, and Dobler &amp; Levine. Information reported to
him that no such firms were listed."</p>

<p>"What did your master do after Miss Beckington left him?"</p>

<p>"Went to the country club to play golf, madam."</p>

<p>"And Miss Beckington?"</p>

<p>"She went into the city by train."</p>

<p>"Rather a hasty trip, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"So it might seem, madam."</p>

<p>"When did she get back?"</p>

<p>"Just before dinner."</p>

<p>"Carrying several parcels?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the butler, with a loop of surprise, "now that you
mention it."</p>

<p>"Wasn't that rather unusual?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am. Ordinarily everything would be sent."</p>

<p>"That's all, thanks."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey turned to Judge Waynham. Her beautiful face was as
grave as that of some antique head of Pallas.</p>

<p>"When I was in the house I asked to be shown Miss Beckington's
room," she went on. "The door was locked, but the constable
obligingly forced it for me. I am aware that this was a high-handed
proceeding on my part, but I was sure that the owner of the room
would forgive me if her conscience was clear.</p>

<p>"In the room was a desk which I likewise forced. In a drawer I
found these papers."</p>

<p>From a sort of reticule of black velvet that she carried Mme.
Storey took a sheaf of papers and spread them before the
magistrate. He blinked at them owlishly.</p>

<p>"They are, you see, blank billheads for the three firms whose
names you had just heard mentioned: N. Hamill &amp; Sons, Nicholas
Enslin, Dobler &amp; Levine."</p>

<p>"But what does it mean?"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey held up her hand to bespeak a moment's patience.</p>

<p>"I returned to the library. I found in a cabinet all the
household bills for months past. Upon consulting them I found every
month a considerable bill from each of these mythical
concerns."</p>

<p>"Good God, madam!"</p>

<p>"It means," said Mme. Storey with her grave air, "that Miss
Beckington has been swindling her employer out of hundreds of
dollars monthly."</p>

<p>Every eye in the room turned on the housekeeper. Laila Darnall
jerked herself free of her arms, looking at her in astonishment and
dismay. Miss Beckington, who had been pale before, now looked
livid. There was an awful terror in her eyes. Her attempt to smile
in a scornful and superior way was something you could not bear to
look at. I mean, it seemed indecent to see a human creature expose
herself like that.</p>

<p>"I take it that Mr. Suydam discovered the thefts today," said
Mme. Storey. "That brings us back to the will. Mr. Greenfield, is
Miss Beckington mentioned, in her employer's will?"</p>

<p>"Yes. A comfortable legacy."</p>

<p>"I thought so. Naturally, his first act upon discovering her
treachery would be to write to you to cut that out. Now as to the
second name on that memorandum pad: this Mrs. Eva Dinehart happens
to be an acquaintance of mine. She conducts a special sort of
employment agency. You go to her for help of a superior and
confidential sort such as a social secretary or a lady
housekeeper--need I say more?"</p>

<p>"But the murder, madam, the murder?" asked Judge Waynham
excitedly.</p>

<p>"I am establishing the motive," said Mme. Storey gravely.
"Dishonor and disgrace faced this lady. At the very moment he was
shot, her employer was writing the letters that would have ruined
her."</p>

<p>"But have you any evidence?"</p>

<p>"I found none in her room or next to none," said Mme. Storey
dryly.</p>

<p>Miss Beckington preened herself, bridled, smiled in that
ghastly, would-be contemptuous manner.</p>

<p>"But I recommend that you have her searched," added Mme. Storey
quietly.</p>

<p>At these words the woman sprang up electrified.</p>

<p>"I won't submit to it!" she cried in a shrill hysterical voice,
and made as if to bolt for the door. Laveel, the constable, seized
her. She struggled like a wildcat. Everybody looked on dazed. It
was inexpressibly shocking to see the elegant Miss Beckington
suddenly reduced to such a state.</p>

<p>"Take her into the dining room," said Judge Waynham.</p>

<p>"Lumley, will you please help him." Mme. Storey added. "You,
Bella, you search her while the men hold her."</p>

<p>It was not a job I relished, but I had no recourse other than to
obey.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, I found in her stocking a
handkerchief bearing Miss Darnall's initials; fastened inside the
lining of the raccoon coat was a pair of sport shoes; and, thirdly,
the strangest of all, wound around and around her body under the
top part of her dress a ladder made of thin strong cord. Fastened
to one end of it were two steel hooks. I returned across the hall
and laid these things on Judge Waynham's desk.</p>

<p>"I thought so," said Mme. Storey offhand. "You see, she had had
no opportunity to dispose of them."</p>

<p>She lifted up the objects one by one.</p>

<p>"The handkerchief she stole from Miss Darnall as she sat beside
her, hoping thereby to make the poor girl's story sound more
incriminating. The shoes, you see, are replicas of Miss Darnall's
from the same manufacturers.</p>

<p>"Miss Beckington bought them today, I have no doubt. She knew
that Miss Darnall always wore such shoes in the park. The rope
ladder she used to leave her room and to return to it. If you look
for them you will find the marks made by the hooks on her window
sill."</p>

<p>At this sudden upset of the case, every vestige of order
disappeared. All the people came pressing into the back room crying
out and attempting to congratulate the one or to abuse the other.
Miss Beckington shrank from them.</p>

<p>Judge Waynham's mild face crimsoned with anger, and above all
the racket I heard his trembling voice:</p>

<p>"You miserable woman! You deliberately set out to fasten a
horrible murder on this helpless child. In all my experience I have
never known the like!"</p>

<p>Miss Beckington had collapsed now. All the fight had gone out of
her.</p>

<p>"I didn't! I didn't!" she wailed. "I tried to make it appear
that a robber had done it!"</p>

<p>"Your purchase of the shoes doesn't bear that out," said the
judge sternly. "All through the proceedings you sat there with your
arms around her, whispering hypocritical comfort in her ear, while
the evidence was produced against her."</p>

<p>"It is horrible!" Miss Beckington's voice rose almost to a
shriek. "I knew they wouldn't hurt her!" she cried. "Young and
pretty as she is, and with all her money, no jury would convict
her! She was safe!"</p>

<p>"Silence!" cried the magistrate. "Your excuses aren't helping
you any! Lock her up!" he said to the constable.</p>

<p>When Miss Beckington was removed the crowd threatened completely
to overwhelm Mme. Storey and the young lovers in their well-meant
efforts to congratulate them. Mme. Storey regarded this
demonstration with good-humored dismay.</p>

<p>I opened the door into the hall to allow them to slip out, and
held it until they had secured themselves in the dining room
opposite. Over there, I presume, the lovers thanked Mme. Storey in
their own way for saving them. I was not present at the scene.
Presently the young couple escaped through a side door of the
house, but were seen as they ran hand in hand for a car, and the
crowd pursued them cheering.</p>

<p>Their faces wore an expression of the most beatific happiness.
There was nothing cold and self-contained about the young man then.
Mme. Storey, Mr. Lipscomb and I drove home feeling well pleased
with ourselves. All in all the case had only taken three hours,
including the drive both ways.</p>

<p>Our host had to be told all about it. After I had finished
sketching the case, Mme. Storey, puffing gratefully at a cigarette,
drawled:</p>

<p>"For complete and unmitigated devilishness I think we shall have
to award Miss Beckington the palm in our gallery of criminals, my
Bella."</p>

<p>The lovers were married shortly after, and prepared to go into
business together. Alvan Wayger's invention, not at all romantic,
but useful, consisted of a new process of enameling that would
produce cheaper and more durable kitchenware for housewives.</p>

<p>As soon as the trust discovered that he had the backing to
manufacture it, they made him a fair offer which he, having no
taste for business, accepted; and with the money he built fine
laboratories in Fremont, where he is now pursuing his experiments
with every facility that the heart of inventor could desire.</p>
