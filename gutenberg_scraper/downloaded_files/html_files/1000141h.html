<br>

<p style="text-indent:0">ONCE I was Hunwulf, the Wanderer. I cannot
explain my knowledge of this fact by any occult or esoteric means,
nor shall I try. A man remembers his past life; I remember my past
<i>lives</i>. Just as a normal individual recalls the shapes that
were him in childhood, boyhood and youth, so I recall the shapes
that have been James Allison in forgotten ages. Why this memory is
mine I cannot say, any more than I can explain the myriad other
phenomena of nature which daily confront me and every other mortal.
But as I lie waiting for death to free me from my long disease, I
see with a clear, sure sight the grand panorama of lives that trail
out behind me. I see the men who have been me, and I see the beasts
that have been me.</p>

<p>For my memory does not end at the coming of Man. How could it,
when the beast so shades into Man that there is no clearly divided
line to mark the boundaries of bestiality? At this instant I see a
dim twilight vista, among the gigantic trees of a primordial forest
that never knew the tread of a leather-shod foot. I see a vast,
shaggy, shambling bulk that lumbers clumsily yet swiftly, sometimes
upright, sometimes on all fours. He delves under rotten logs for
grubs and insects, and his small ears twitch continually. He lifts
his head and bares yellow fangs. He is primordial, bestial,
anthropoid; yet I recognize his kinship with the entity now called
James Allison. Kinship? Say rather oneness. I am he; he is I. My
flesh is soft and white and hairless; his is dark and tough and
shaggy. Yet we were one, and already in his feeble, shadowed brain
are beginning to stir and tingle the man-thoughts and the man
dreams, crude, chaotic, fleeting, yet the basis for all the high
and lofty visions men have dreamed in all the following ages.</p>

<p>Nor does my knowledge cease there. It goes back, back, down
immemorial vistas I dare not follow, to abysses too dark and awful
for the human mind to plumb. Yet even there I am aware of my
identity, my individuality. I tell you the individual is never
lost, neither in the black pit from which we once crawled, blind,
squalling and noisome, or in that eventual Nirvana in which we
shall one day sink&mdash;which I have glimpsed afar off, shining as
a blue twilight lake among the mountains of the stars.</p>

<p>But enough. I would tell you of Hunwulf. Oh, it was long, long
ago! How long ago I dare not say. Why should I seek for paltry
human comparisons to describe a realm indescribably,
incomprehensibly distant? Since that age the earth had altered her
contours not once but a dozen times, and whole cycles of mankind
have completed their destinies.</p>

<p>I was Hunwulf, a son of the golden-haired Aesir, who, from the
icy plains of shadowy Asgard, sent blue-eyed tribes around the
world in century-long drifts to leave their trails in strange
places. On one of those southward drifts I was born, for I never
saw the homeland of my people, where the bulk of the Nordheimer
still dwelt in their horse-hide tents among the snows.</p>

<p>I grew to manhood on that long wandering, to the fierce, sinewy,
untamed manhood of the Aesir, who knew no gods but Ymir of the
frost-rimmed beard, and whose axes are stained with the blood of
many nations. My thews were like woven steel cords. My yellow hair
fell in a lion-like mane to my mighty shoulders. My loins were girt
with leopard skin. With either hand I could wield my heavy
flint-headed axe.</p>

<p>Year by year my tribe drifted southward, sometimes swinging in
long arcs to east or west, sometimes lingering for months or years
in fertile valleys or plains where the grass-eaters swarmed, but
always forging slowly and inevitably southward. Sometimes our way
led through vast and breathless solitudes that had never known a
human cry; sometimes strange tribes disputed our course, and our
trail passed over bloodstained ashes of butchered villages. And
amidst this wandering, hunting and slaughtering, I came to full
manhood and the love of Gudrun.</p>

<p>What shall I say of Gudrun? How describe color to the blind? I
can say that her skin was whiter than milk, that her hair was
living gold with the flame of the sun caught in it, that the supple
beauty of her body would shame the dream that shaped the Grecian
goddesses. But I cannot make you realize the fire and wonder that
was Gudrun. You have no basis for comparison; you know womanhood
only by the women of your epoch, who, beside her are like candles
beside the glow of the full moon. Not for a millennium of
millenniums have women like Gudrun walked the earth. Cleopatra,
Thais, Helen of Troy, they were but pallid shadows of her beauty,
frail mimicries of the blossom that blooms to full glory only in
the primordial.</p>

<p>For Gudrun I forsook my tribe and my people, and went into the
wilderness, an exile and an outcast, with blood on my hands. She
was of my race, but not of my tribe: a waif whom we found as a
child wandering in a dark forest, lost from some wandering tribe of
our blood. She grew up in the tribe, and when she came to the full
ripeness of her glorious young womanhood, she was given to Heimdul
the Strong, the mightiest hunter of the tribe.</p>

<p>But the dream of Gudrun was madness in my soul, a flame that
burned eternally, and for her I slew Heimdul, crushing his skull
with my flint-headed axe ere he could bear her to his horse-hide
tent. And then follows our long flight from the vengeance of the
tribe. Willingly she went with me, for she loved me with the love
of the Aesir women, which is a devouring flame that destroys
weakness. Oh, it was a savage age, when life was grim and
bloodstained, and the weak died quickly. There was nothing mild or
gentle about us, our passions were those of the tempest, the surge
and impact of battle, the challenge of the lion. Our loves were as
terrible as our hates.</p>

<p>And so I carried Gudrun from the tribe, and the killers were hot
on our trail. For a night and a day they pressed us hard, until we
swam a rising river, a roaring, foaming torrent that even the men
of the Aesir dared not attempt. But in the madness of our love and
recklessness we buffetted our way across, beaten and torn by the
frenzy of the flood, and reached the farther bank alive.</p>

<p>Then for many days we traversed upland forests haunted by tigers
and leopards, until we came to a great barrier of mountains, blue
ramparts climbing awesomely to the sky. Slope piled upon slope.</p>

<p>In those mountains we were assailed by freezing winds and
hunger, and by giant condors which swept down upon us with a
thunder of gigantic wings. In grim battles in the passes I shot
away all my arrows and splintered my flint-headed spear, but at
last we crossed the bleak backbone of the range and descending the
southern slopes, came upon a village of mud huts among the cliffs
inhabited by a peaceful, brown-skinned people who spoke a strange
tongue and had strange customs. But they greeted us with the sign
of peace, and brought us into their village, where they set meat
and barley-bread and fermented milk before us, and squatted in a
ring about us while we ate, and a woman slapped softly on a
bowl-shaped tom-tom to do us honor.</p>

<p>We had reached their village at dusk, and night fell while we
feasted. On all sides rose the cliffs and peaks shouldering
massively against the stars. The little cluster of mud huts and the
tiny fires were drowned and lost in the immensity of the night.
Gudrun felt the loneliness, the crowding desolation of that
darkness, and she pressed close to me, her shoulder against my
breast. But my axe was close at my hand, and I had never known the
sensation of fear.</p>

<p>The little brown people squatted before us, men and women, and
tried to talk to us with motions of their slender hands. Dwelling
always in one place, in comparative security, they lacked both the
strength and the uncompromising ferocity of the nomadic Aesir.
Their hands fluttered with friendly gestures in the firelight.</p>

<p>I made them understand that we had come from the north, had
crossed the backbone of the great mountain range, and that on the
morrow it was our intention to descend into the green tablelands
which we had glimpsed southward of the peaks. When they understood
my meaning they set up a great cry shaking their heads violently,
and beating madly on the drum. They were all so eager to impart
something to me, and all waving their hands at once, that they
bewildered rather than enlightened me. Eventually they did make me
understand that they did not wish me to descend the mountains. Some
menace lay to the south of the village, but whether of man or
beast, I could not learn.</p>

<p>It was while they were all gesticulating and my whole attention
was centered on their gestures, that the blow fell. The first
intimation was a sudden thunder of wings in my ears; a dark shape
rushed out of the night, and a great pinion dealt me a buffet over
the head as I turned. I was knocked sprawling, and in that instant
I heard Gudrun scream as she was torn from my side. Bounding up,
quivering with a furious eagerness to rend and slay, I saw the dark
shape vanish again into the darkness, a white, screaming, writhing
figure trailing from its talons.</p>

<p>Roaring my grief and fury I caught up my axe and charged into
the dark&mdash;then halted short, wild, desperate, knowing not
which way to turn.</p>

<p>The little brown people had scattered, screaming, knocking
sparks from their fires as they rushed over them in their haste to
gain their huts, but now they crept out fearfully, whimpering like
wounded dogs. They gathered around me and plucked at me with timid
hands and chattered in their tongue while I cursed in sick
impotency, knowing they wished to tell me something which I could
not understand.</p>

<p>At last I suffered them to lead me back to the fire, and there
the oldest man of the tribe brought forth a strip of cured hide, a
clay pot of pigments, and a stick. On the hide he painted a crude
picture of a winged thing carrying a white woman&mdash;oh, it was
very crude, but I made out his meaning. Then all pointed southward
and cried out loudly in their own tongue; and I knew that the
menace they had warned me against was the thing that had carried
off Gudrun. Until then I supposed that it had been one of the great
mountain condors which had carried her away, but the picture the
old man drew, in black paint, resembled a winging man more than
anything else.</p>

<p>Then, slowly and laboriously, he began to trace something I
finally recognized as a map&mdash;oh, yes, even in those dim days
we had our primitive maps, though no modern man would be able to
comprehend them so greatly different was our symbolism.</p>

<p>It took a long time; it was midnight before the old man had
finished and I understood his tracings. But at last the matter was
made clear. If I followed the course traced on the map, down the
long narrow valley where stood the village, across a plateau, down
a series of rugged slopes and along another valley, I would come to
the place where lurked the being which had stolen my woman. At that
spot the old man drew what looked like a mis-shapen hut, with many
strange markings all about it in red pigments. Pointing to these,
and again to me, he shook his head, with those loud cries that
seemed to indicate peril among these people.</p>

<p>Then they tried to persuade me not to go, but afire with
eagerness I took the piece of hide and pouch of food they thrust
into my hands (they were indeed a strange people for that age),
grasped my axe and set off in the moonless darkness. But my eyes
were keener than a modern mind can comprehend, and my sense of
direction was as a wolfs. Once the map was fixed in my mind, I
could have thrown it away and come unerring to the place I sought
but I folded it and thrust it into my girdle.</p>

<p>I traveled at my best speed through the starlight, taking no
heed of any beasts that might be seeking their prey&mdash;cave bear
or saber-toothed tiger. At times I heard gravel slide under
stealthy padded paws; I glimpsed fierce yellow eyes burning in the
darkness, and caught sight of shadowy, skulking forms. But I
plunged on recklessly, in too desperate a mood to give the path to
any beast however fearsome.</p>

<p>I traversed the valley, climbed a ridge and came out on a broad
plateau, gashed with ravines and strewn with boulders. I crossed
this and in the darkness before dawn commenced my climb down the
treacherous slopes. They seemed endless, falling away in a long
steep incline until their feet were lost in darkness. But I went
down recklessly, not pausing to unsling the rawhide rope I carried
about my shoulders, trusting to my luck and skill to bring me down
without a broken neck.</p>

<p>And just as dawn was touching the peaks with a white glow, I
dropped into a broad valley, walled by stupendous cliffs. At that
point it was wide from east to west, but the cliffs converged
toward the lower end, giving the valley the appearance of a great
fan, narrowing swiftly toward the south.</p>

<p>The floor was level, traversed by a winding stream. Trees grew
thinly; there was no underbrush, but a carpet of tall grass, which
at that time of year were somewhat dry. Along the stream where the
green lush grew, wandered mammoths, hairy mountains of flesh and
muscle.</p>

<p>I gave them a wide berth, giants too mighty for me to cope with,
confident in their power, and afraid of only one thing on earth.
They bent forward their great ears and lifted their trunks
menacingly when I approached too near, but they did not attack me.
I ran swiftly among the trees, and the sun was not yet above the
eastern ramparts which its rising edged with golden flame, when I
came to the point where the cliffs converged. My night-long climb
had not affected my iron muscles. I felt no weariness; my fury
burned unabated. What lay beyond the cliffs I could not know; I
ventured no conjecture. I had room in my brain only for red wrath
and killing-lust.</p>

<p>The cliffs did not form a solid wall. That is, the extremities
of the converging palisades did not meet, leaving a notch or gap a
few hundred feet wide, and emerged into a second valley, or rather
into a continuance of the same valley which broadened out again
beyond the pass.</p>

<p>The cliffs slanted away swiftly to east and west, to form a
giant rampart that marched clear around the valley in the shape of
a vast oval. It formed a blue rim all around the valley without a
break except for a glimpse of the clear sky that seemed to mark
another notch at the southern end. The inner valley was shaped much
like a great bottle, with two necks.</p>

<p>The neck by which I entered was crowded with trees, which grew
densely for several hundred yards, when they gave way abruptly to a
field of crimson flowers. And a few hundred yards beyond the edges
of the trees, I saw a strange structure.</p>

<p>I must speak of what I saw not alone as Hunwulf, but as James
Allison as well. For Hunwulf only vaguely comprehended the things
he saw, and, as Hunwulf, he could not describe them at all. I, as
Hunwulf, knew nothing of architecture. The only man-built dwelling
I had ever seen had been the horse-hide tents of my people, and the
thatched mud huts of the barley people&mdash;and other people
equally primitive.</p>

<p>So as Hunwulf I could only say that I looked upon a great hut
the construction of which was beyond my comprehension. But I, James
Allison, know that it was a tower, some seventy feet in height, of
a curious green stone, highly polished, and of a substance that
created the illusion of semi-translucency. It was cylindrical, and,
as near as I could see, without doors or windows. The main body of
the building was perhaps sixty feet in height, and from its center
rose a smaller tower that completed its full stature. This tower,
being much inferior in girth to the main body of the structure, and
thus surrounded by a sort of gallery, with a crenellated parapet,
and was furnished with both doors, curiously arched, and windows,
thickly barred as I could see, even from where I stood.</p>

<p>That was all. No evidence of human occupancy. No sign of life in
all the valley. But it was evident that this castle was what the
old man of the mountain village had been trying to draw, and I was
certain that in it I would find Gudrun&mdash;if she still
lived.</p>

<p>Beyond the tower I saw the glimmer of a blue lake into which the
stream, following the curve of the western wall, eventually flowed.
Lurking amid the trees I glared at the tower and at the flowers
surrounding it on all sides, growing thick along the walls and
extending for hundreds of yards in all directions. There were trees
at the other end of the valley, near the lake; but no trees grew
among the flowers.</p>

<p>They were not like any plants I had ever seen. They grew close
together, almost touching each other. They were some four feet in
height, with only one blossom on each stalk, a blossom larger than
a man&rsquo;s head, with broad, fleshy petals drawn close together.
These petals were a livid crimson, the hue of an open wound. The
stalks were thick as a man&rsquo;s wrist, colorless, almost
transparent. The poisonously green leaves were shaped like
spearheads, drooping on long snaky stems. Their whole aspect was
repellent, and I wondered what their denseness concealed.</p>

<p>For all my wild-born instincts were roused in me. I felt lurking
peril, just as I had often sensed the ambushed lion before my
external senses recognized him. I scanned the dense blossoms
closely, wondering if some great serpent lay coiled among them. My
nostrils expanded as I quested for a scent, but the wind was
blowing away from me. But there was something decidedly unnatural
about that vast garden. Though the north wind swept over it, not a
blossom stirred, not a leaf rustled; they hung motionless, sullen,
like birds of prey with drooping heads, and I had a strange feeling
that they were watching me like living things.</p>

<p>It was like a landscape in a dream: on either hand the blue
cliffs lifting against the cloud-fleeced sky; in the distance the
dreaming lake; and that fantastic green tower rising in the midst
of that livid crimson field.</p>

<p>And there was something else: in spite of the wind that was
blowing away from me, I caught a scent, a charnel-house reek of
death and decay and corruption that rose from the blossoms.</p>

<p>Then suddenly I crouched closer in my covert. There was life and
movement on the castle. A figure emerged from the tower, and coming
to the parapet, leaned upon it and looked out across the valley. It
was a man, but such a man as I had never dreamed of, even in
nightmares.</p>

<p>He was tall, powerful, black with the hue of polished ebony; but
the feature which made a human nightmare of him was the batlike
wings which folded on his shoulders. I knew they were wings: the
fact was obvious and indisputable.</p>

<p>I, James Allison, have pondered much on that phenomenon which I
witnessed through the eyes of Hunwulf. Was that winged man merely a
freak, an isolated example of distorted nature, dwelling in
solitude and immemorial desolation? Or was he a survival of a
forgotten race, which had risen, reigned and vanished before the
coming of man as we know him? The little brown people of the hills
might have told me, but we had no speech in common. Yet I am
inclined to the latter theory. Winged men are not uncommon in
mythology; they are met with in the folklore of many nations and
many races. As far back as man may go in myth, chronicle and
legend, he finds tales of harpies and winged gods, angels and
demons. Legends are distorted shadows of pre-existent realities, I
believe that once a race of winged black men ruled a pre-Adamite
world, and that I, Hunwulf, met the last survivor of that race in
the valley of the red blossoms.</p>

<p>These thoughts I think as James Allison, with my modern
knowledge which is as imponderable as my modern ignorance.</p>

<p>I, Hunwulf, indulged in no such speculations. Modern skepticism
was not a part of my nature, nor did I seek to rationalize what
seemed not to coincide with a natural universe. I acknowledged no
gods but Ymir and his daughters, but I did not doubt the
existence&mdash;as demons&mdash;of other deities, worshipped by
other races. Supernatural beings of all sorts fitted into my
conception of life and the universe. I no more doubted the
existence of dragons, ghosts, fiends and devils than I doubted the
existence of lions and buffaloes and elephants. I accepted this
freak of nature as a supernatural demon and did not worry about its
origin or source. Nor was I thrown into a panic of superstitious
fear. I was a son of Asgard, who feared neither man nor devil, and
I had more faith in the crushing power of my flint axe than in the
spells of priests or the incantations of sorcerers.</p>

<p>But I did not immediately rush into the open and charge the
tower. The wariness of the wild was mine, and I saw no way to climb
the castle. The winged man needed no doors on the side, because he
evidently entered at the top, and the slick surface of the walls
seemed to defy the most skillful climber. Presently a way of
getting upon the tower occurred to me, but I hesitated, waiting to
see if any other winged people appeared, though I had an
unexplainable feeling that he was the only one of his kind in the
valley&mdash;possibly in the world. While I crouched among the
trees and watched, I saw him lift his elbows from the parapet and
stretch lithely, like a great cat. Then he strode across the
circular gallery and entered the tower. A muffled cry rang out on
the air which caused me to stiffen, though even so I realized that
it was not the cry of a woman. Presently the black master of the
castle emerged, dragging a smaller figure with him&mdash;a figure
which writhed and struggled and cried out piteously. I saw that it
was a small brown man, much like those of the mountain village.
Captured, I did not doubt, as Gudrun had been captured.</p>

<p>He was like a child in the hands of his huge foe. The black man
spread broad wings and rose over the parapet, carrying his captive
as a condor might carry a sparrow. He soared out over the field of
blossoms, while I crouched in my leafy retreat, glaring in
amazement.</p>

<p>The winged man, hovering in mid-air, voiced a strange weird cry;
and it was answered in horrible fashion. A shudder of awful life
passed over the crimson field beneath him. The great red blossoms
trembled, opened, spreading their fleshy petals like the mouths of
serpents. Their stalks seemed to elongate, stretching upward
eagerly. Their broad leaves lifted and vibrated with a curious
lethal whirring, like the singing of a rattlesnake. A faint but
flesh-crawling hissing sounded over all the valley. The blossoms
gasped, straining upward. And with a fiendish laugh, the winged man
dropped his writhing captive.</p>

<p>With a scream of a lost soul the brown man hurtled downward,
crashing among the flowers. And with a rustling hiss, they were on
him. Their thick flexible stalks arched like the necks of serpents,
their petals closed on his flesh. A hundred blossoms clung to him
like the tentacles of an octopus, smothering and crushing him down.
His shrieks of agony came muffled; he was completely hidden by the
hissing, threshing flowers. Those beyond reach swayed and writhed
furiously as if seeking to tear up their roots in their eagerness
to join their brothers. All over the field the great red blossoms
leaned and strained toward the spot where the grisly battle went
on. The shrieks sank lower and lower and lower, and ceased. A dread
silence reigned over the valley. The black man flapped his way
leisurely back to the tower, and vanished within it.</p>

<p>Then presently the blossoms detached themselves one by one from
their victim who lay very white and still. Aye, his whiteness was
more than that of death; he was like a wax image, a staring effigy
from which every drop of blood had been sucked. And a startling
transmutation was evident in the flowers directly about him. Their
stalks no longer colorless; they were swollen and dark red, like
transparent bamboos filled to the bursting with fresh blood.</p>

<p>Drawn by an insatiable curiosity, I stole from the trees and
glided to the very edge of the red field. The blossoms hissed and
bent toward me, spreading their petals like the hood of a roused
cobra. Selecting one farthest from its brothers, I severed the
stalk with a stroke of my axe, and the thing tumbled to the ground,
writhing like a beheaded serpent.</p>

<p>When its struggles ceased I bent over it in wonder. The stalk
was not hollow as I had supposed&mdash;that is, hollow like a dry
bamboo. It was traversed by a network of thread-like veins, some
empty and some exuding a colorless sap. The stems which held the
leaves to the stalk were remarkably tenacious and pliant, and the
leaves themselves were edged with curved spines, like sharp
hooks.</p>

<p>Once those spines were sunk in the flesh, the victim would be
forced to tear up the whole plant by the roots if he escaped.</p>

<p>The petals were each as broad as my hand, and as thick as a
prickly pear, and on the inner side covered with innumerable tiny
mouths, not larger than the head of a pin. In the center, where the
pistil should be, there was a barbed spike, of a substance like
thorn, and narrow channels between the four serrated edges.</p>

<p>From my investigations of this horrible travesty of vegetation,
I looked up suddenly, just in time to see the winged man appear
again on the parapet. He did not seem particularly surprised to see
me. He shouted in his unknown tongue and made a mocking gesture,
while I stood statue-like, gripping my axe. Presently he turned and
entered the tower as he had done before; and as before, he emerged
with a captive. My fury and hate were almost submerged by the flood
of joy that Gudrun was alive.</p>

<p>In spite of her supple strength, which was that of a
she-panther, the black man handled Gudrun as easily as he had
handled the brown man. Lifting her struggling white body high above
his head, he displayed her to me and yelled tauntingly. Her golden
hair streamed over her white shoulders as she fought vainly, crying
to me in the terrible extremity of her fright and horror. Not
lightly was a woman of the Aesir reduced to cringing terror. I
measured the depths of her captor&rsquo;s diabolism by her frenzied
cries.</p>

<p>But I stood motionless. If it would have saved her, I would have
plunged into that crimson morass of hell, to be hooked and pierced
and sucked white by those fiendish flowers. But that would help her
none. My death would merely leave her without a defender. So I
stood silent while she writhed and whimpered, and the black
man&rsquo;s laughter sent red waves of madness surging across my
brain. Once he made as if to cast her down among the flowers, and
my iron control almost snapped and sent me plunging into that red
sea of hell. But it was only a gesture. Presently he dragged her
back to the tower and tossed her inside. Then he turned back to the
parapet, rested his elbows upon it, and fell to watching me.
Apparently he was playing with us as a cat plays with a mouse
before he destroys it.</p>

<p>But while he watched, I turned my back and strode into the
forest. I, Hunwulf, was not a thinker, as modern men understand the
term. I lived in an age where emotions were translated by the smash
of a flint axe rather than by emanations of the intellect. Yet I
was not the senseless animal the black man evidently supposed me to
be. I had a human brain, whetted by the eternal struggle for
existence and supremacy.</p>

<p>I knew I could not cross that red strip that banded the castle,
alive. Before I could take a half dozen steps a score of barbed
spikes would be thrust into my flesh, their avid mouths sucking the
blood from my veins to feed their demoniac lust. Even my tigerish
strength would not avail to hew a path through them.</p>

<p>The winged man did not follow. Looking back, I saw him still
lounging in the same position. When I, as James Allison, dream
again the dreams of Hunwulf, that, image is etched in my mind, that
gargoyle figure with elbows propped on the parapet, like a medieval
devil brooding on the battlements of hell.</p>

<p>I passed through the straits of the valley and came into the
vale beyond where the trees thinned and the mammoths lumbered along
the stream. Beyond the herd I stopped and drawing a pair of flints
into my pouch, stooped and struck a spark in the dry grass. Running
swiftly from chosen place to place, I set a dozen fires, in a great
semi-circle. The north wind caught them, whipped them into eager
life, drove them before it. In a few moments a rampart of flame was
sweeping down the valley.</p>

<p>The mammoths ceased their feeding, lifted their great ears and
bellowed alarm. In all the world they feared only fire. They began
to retreat southward, the cows herding the calves before them,
bulls trumpeting like the blast of Judgement Day. Roaring like a
storm the fire rushed on, and the mammoths broke and stampeded, a
crushing hurricane of flesh, a thundering earthquake of hurtling
bone and muscle. Trees splintered and went down before them, the
ground shook under their headlong tread. Behind them came the
racing fire and on the heels of the fire came I, so closely that
the smouldering earth burnt the moose-hide sandals off my feet.</p>

<p>Through the narrow neck they thundered, levelling the dense
thickets like a giant scythe. Trees were torn up by the roots; it
was as if a tornado had ripped through the pass.</p>

<p>With a deafening thunder of pounding feet and trumpeting, they
stormed across the sea of red blossoms. Those devilish plants might
have even pulled down and destroyed a single mammoth; but under the
impact of the whole herd, they were no more than common flowers.
The maddened titans crashed through and over them, battering them
to shreds, hammering, stamping them into the earth which grew soggy
with their juice.</p>

<p>I trembled for an instant, fearing the brutes would not turn
aside for the castle, and dubious of even it being able to
withstand that battering ram concussion. Evidently the winged man
shared my fears, for he shot up from the tower and raced off
through the sky toward the lake. But one of the bulls butted
head-on into the wall, was shunted off the smooth curving surface,
caromed into the one next to him, and the herd split and roared by
the tower on either hand, so closely their hairy sides rasped
against it. They thundered on through the red field toward the
distant lake.</p>

<p>The fire, reaching the edge of the trees, was checked; the
smashed sappy fragments of the red flowers would not burn. Trees,
fallen or standing, smoked and burst into flame, and burning
branches showered around me as I ran through the trees and out into
the gigantic swath the charging herd had cut through the livid
field.</p>

<p>As I ran I shouted to Gudrun and she answered me. Her voice was
muffled and accompanied by a hammering on something. The winged man
had locked her in a tower.</p>

<p>As I came under the castle wall, treading on remnants of red
petals and snaky stalks, I unwound my rawhide rope, swung it, and
sent its loop shooting upward to catch on one of the merlons of the
crenellated parapet. Then I went up it, hand over hand, gripping
the rope between my toes, bruising my knuckles and elbows against
the sheer wall as I swung about.</p>

<p>I was within five feet of the parapet when I was galvanized by
the beat of wings about my head. The black man shot out of the air
and landed on the gallery. I got a good look at him as he leaned
over the parapet. His features were straight and regular; there was
no suggestion of the negroid about him. His eyes were slanted
slits, and his teeth gleamed in a savage grin of hate and triumph.
Long, long he had ruled the valley of the red blossoms, levelling
tribute of human lives from the miserable tribes of the hills, for
writhing victims to feed the carnivorous half-bestial flowers which
were his subjects and protectors. And now I was in his power, my
fierceness, and craft gone for naught. A stroke of the crooked
dagger in his hand and I would go hurtling to my death. Somewhere
Gudrun, seeing my peril, was screaming like a wild thing, and then
a door crashed with a splintering of wood.</p>

<p>The black man, intent upon his gloating, laid the keen edge of
his dagger on the rawhide strand&mdash;then a strong white arm
locked about his neck from behind, and he was jerked violently
backward. Over his shoulder I saw the beautiful face of Gudrun, her
hair standing on end, her eyes dilated with terror and fury.</p>

<p>With a roar he turned in her grasp, tore loose her clinging arms
and hurled her against the tower with such force that she lay half
stunned. Then he turned again to me, but in that instant I had
swarmed up and over the parapet, and leaped upon the gallery,
unslinging my axe.</p>

<p>For an instant he hesitated, his wings half-lifted, his hand
poising on his dagger, as if uncertain whether to fight or take to
the air. He was a giant in stature, with muscles standing out in
corded ridges all over him, but he hesitated, as uncertain as a man
when confronted by a wild beast.</p>

<p>I did not hesitate. With a deep-throated roar I sprang, swinging
my axe with all my giant strength. With a strangled cry he threw up
his arms; but down between them the axe plunged and blasted his
head to red ruin.</p>

<p>I wheeled toward Gudrun; and struggling to her knees, she threw
her white arms about me in a desperate clasp of love and terror,
staring awedly to where lay the winged lord of the valley, the
crimson pulp that had been his head drowned in a puddle of blood
and brains.</p>

<p>I had often wished that it were possible to draw these various
lives of mine together in one body, combining the experiences of
Hunwulf with the knowledge of James Allison. Could that be so,
Hunwulf would have gone through the ebony door which Gudrun in her
desperate strength had shattered, into that weird chamber he
glimpsed through the ruined panels, with fantastic furnishing, and
shelves heaped with rolls of parchment. He would have unrolled
those scrolls and pored over their characters until he deciphered
them, and read, perhaps, the chronicles of that weird race whose
last survivor he had just slain. Surely the tale was stranger than
an opium dream, and marvelous as the story of lost Atlantis.</p>

<p>But Hunwulf had no such curiosity. To him the tower, the ebony
furnished chamber and the rolls of parchment were meaningless,
inexplicable emanations of sorcery, whose significance lay only in
their diabolism. Though the solution of mystery lay under his
fingers, he was far removed from it as James Allison, millenniums
yet unborn.</p>

<p>To me, Hunwulf, the castle was but a monstrous trap, concerning
which I had but one emotion, and that a desire to escape from it as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p>With Gudrun clinging to me I slid to the ground, then with a
dextrous flip I freed my rope and wound it; and after that we went
hand and hand along the path made by the mammoths, now vanishing in
the distance, toward the blue lake at the southern end of the
valley and the notch in the cliffs beyond it.</p>
